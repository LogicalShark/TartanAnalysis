CARNEGIE DAY CELEBRATED__INjITTINGIMANNER
Schools Open for Inspection on FridayFestival Held In 
Memorial Hall Saturday Night
5,000 AT INSPECTIONS
Carnegie Day was Pittsburgh Day 
for the Tech schools. Every shop 
and laboratory throughout the Insti
tute was in full operation for public 
inspection. Although the clay was 
cold and disagreeable, there were
hundreds of people who visited the 
campus last Friday. The largest
crowds appeared in the evening. The 
campus was alone a sight that called 
forth the admiration of visitors, for 
every light including the special il
lumination of Machinery Hall tower 
'was blazed out in the chill night air. 
Students were scheduled in the va
rious laboratories and as visitors 
came in the work being done, was 
explained by picked guides. In
Science school the alloy making in 
the metallurgical laboratory aiid the 
experiments in radio activity by Dr. 
Grondahl, seemed to attract most at
tention.
The plays and musicales given in 
Design school were so well attended 
that the seating capacity was too 
limited to accommodate one-third of 
the people. The several displays in 
Margaret Morrison School, part of 
"which the public participated in, 
were scenes of considerable rivalry. 
-Mr. Dosey had students in his de
partment run several heats in the 
furnaces, and some particularly good 
castings were made, much to the in
terest of the spectators.
Tech night this year eclipsed all 
previous. Tech nights, and there is 
every 'reason to believe that tlie next 
inspection night will find our Insti-. 
tiite more advanced and ready with 
a greater variety of exhibits.
A new Tech custom was inaugu
rated last Saturday night when the 
faculty, the alumni and the seniors 
. unet together in the banquet room of 
Soldiers Memorial Hall in honor pf 
the eighty-first anniversary of. An
drew Carnegies birth. At the same 
time various Tech clans throughout 
the country were meeting together 
renewing old Tech associations, and 
Tnost of them sent felicltatious tele
grams which were read by Mr. McCorkle at the gathering here.
The affair was strictly informal, 
and this condition brought out a 
fact that . Tech students know that 
the faculty are a mighty fine bunch.

COMMITTEE SETS DATE 
FOR BIG JUNIOR PROM
Foyer of Carnegie Music Hall 
\ Has Been Secured for the 
Event
DA*TE IS FEBRUARY 21
The greatest Junior Proiii in the 
history of Carnegie Tech is what the 
plans and arrangements of the Prom 
Committee call for. This committee, 
as announced in last weeks issue of 
The Tartan, has outlined definitely 
their plans and procedure for this 
greatest event in any college man's 
career.
The date has been definitely set 
for the evening of February 21st. 
This date is expected to prove very 
satisfactory for the reason that the 
day following is a legal holiday, be
ing Washingtons birthday, on which 
date there are 110 classes.
After much difficulty and much di
plomacy by the committee, special 
meetings, etc., the committee have 
been successful in securing the foyer 
of the Carnegie Music Hall as the 
scene of this great event. The spa
cious, handsome foyer will be used 
for dancing. This foyer is treated iff 
a French-Classic style of architec
ture with the green of the marble 
and the gold of the decorations the 
dominant colors. The committee 
deems itself exceedingly fortunate in 
securing this place in which to hold 
the dance on account of its spacious
ness and great beauty. On the sec
ond floor, accessible from the foyer 
and through the handsome balcony 
overlooking the dance floor are found 
the ladies retiring rooms. These are 
elaborately furnished with quaint, 
light blue upholstered furniture and 
hangings. The mens smoking and

minor colleges, which have up until 
recently been on the Carnegie Tech 
'varsity schedule. About six games 
will be played, two of which will be 
out of town.
With the inauguration of this plan 
by Coach Steffen and the two man
agers, Carnegie Tech will have taken 
another long stride toward building 
up a football team which will bring 
nothing but glory to dear old Tech. 
It will give the players a bigger and 
better chance to show their ability, 
as well as to learn the finer points 
of the game. The coach will be able 
to see his substitutes in action more 
and so know more of their qualifica
tions for 'varsity players.
Everything considered, It offers a 
most promising way of building up 
material which in time would develop 
into a "sure enough Plaid team;

Mils prlvilogo possible. Not content

gratitude.
AN APPRECIATION.
During the past week the members 
of the football team of the Univer
sity of Pittsburgh sent flowers to 
Altdoerf.er, who is at the West Penn 
hospital; also DeHart visited the in
jured football player. This seems to 
us a fine showing of spirit, and shows 
a touch of sympathy which is de
serving of praise. We are sure that 
all Tech students recognize this act 
and appreciate the feeling of good 
fellowship which prompted it.
Further evidence of Pitts attitude 
toward Tech was shown in a letter 
from Captain Peck, of the Univer
sity of Pittsburghs football team, in' 
which he again stated that the team 
regretted the article appearing in 
the Pitt Weekly.
This attitude, coming from men 
who count at Pitt, is conclusive evi
dence that the spirit which prompt
ed tho Tech students to hold tho 
Pit.t-Toch smokor last year was abso
lutely justified. We trust that tho 
student body continue to harbor this 
fooling of friendship and fellowship 
toward Pitt.

Pittsburgh Press
If Carnegie Tech has been seeking 
a reputation in football, it gained its 
^end yesterday, when its gridiron 
warriors threw a wrench into the 
well oiled Pitt machine at Forbes 
Field and held the Panthers to a 
14-0 score. Despite the worlc of the 
officials, whose incessant penalizing 
did much to slow up the work of 
both teams, the game was probably 
the most spectacular gridiron struggle 
staged in this city this season.
Kesners forward pass over tiie 
Pitt goal line to Early, in the -fourth

game since the Penn State match

Tech by a small score of 14 to 6, 
scoring their points in the first half 
of the game, after which the Plaid 
held them more than even, getting a 
touchdown in the last quarter. The 
Carnegie lads played /vonderfully 
against their heavier opponents..
Tech intercepted almost all of the 
forward passes started by Pitt and

attack and depended entirely on McLarrens plunging and Deharts end

Pittsburgh Gazette Times:
Pitt won the game and that is 
about all it did, for the greatest 
share of the praise goes to the Tech 
teafh, which earned it through its 
earnest endeavor. Steffens men show
ed rare fighting spirit, which was the 
dominant factor in their play, much' 
more so than that of Pitt.
Pitt scored touchdown in the first 
and second periods, while Tech wait
ed until the fourth session to cross 
the Pitt goal line, being the second 
team ol the year to do it, something 
that Syracuse, Pennsylvania and W. 
& J. were unable to do.
Pittsburgh Post:
The score was 14 to 6, and Pitt 
won, but the Panthers had a terrible 
time doing it. Tech made it uncom
mon interesting and handed the Pitt 
contingent the stiffest jolt it has ac
quired this season, not excepting 
even the4 Navy contest.
Now this may not be a very 
sporting thing to do, but, just for 
the sak of convincing you that it 
was considerable jolt to Pitt, let us 
quote the opening paragraph of the 
advance story on the game appear
ing in the Pitt Weekly:

Philadelphia Inquirer:
The Carnegie Tech football team 
gave the University of Pittsburgh its 
hardest game of the season at For
bes Field this afternoon and succeed
ed in scoring a touchdown against 
Glenn Warners champions. The final 
score was 14 to 6. Techs score, the 
first made against Pitt on the home 
field this season, came early in the 
final period, when Sunny Kesner, 
Techs star quarterback, threw a 
forward pass 30 yards to Early be
hind the Pitt goal. The play was 
well executed and caught the Panth
er players off their guard, all of 
Warners pupils being on the watcliout for an attempt at a field goal.
New York Sun:
Glen Warners Pittsburgh gridders 
wore handed a surprise today when 
Carnegie Tech scored the first touch
down against them on the home 
grounds this year. Pitt, won, 14 to 6.
Toch hold its own against tho 
Blue and Gold in tho last, two pe
riods. Techs scoro came on a for
ward pass from Kesner to Early 
across tho goal line. Kesner missed 
the goal.

ly Carnegie Pets, the pride of Woodlawn avenue. 
The college scribe was right in 
one cardinal point. The Pitt Panther 
did dine on the Slcibo outfit, but, oh, 
gee, the Panthers almost ruined'their 
nice, fine white teeth, and they've 
got indigestion this^ fine morning, 
too, nor will their tummies feel com
fortable for a week or more. The 
process of assimilating Tech bore 
some resemblance to a duck swallow
ing a froga mighty gulp, but he 
made it ! \
Pitt was up against it from the 
start. The Panthers were forced to 
play as safe as possible.

Pittsburgh Leader:
The wearers of the, Plaid took a 
fall out of the Pitt eleven and when 
the smoke of battle had cleared 
away at Forbes Field yesterday aft
ernoon the score stood, Pitt 14, Car
negie Tech 6.
It was a clear-cut Tech victory 
from many standpoints.
The followers of ' the Gold and 
Blue were so confident that the Pitt 
crew would walk all over the Technites that they overlooked the speed 
of the followers of the teachings of 
Walter Steffen.
The result was that by some of 
the most brilliant playing the ball 
was. run down the field until it came 
close enough to the Pitt goal line, 
and then, by a mighty throw from 
the arm of Kesner, Early, who was 
on the watcliout for the fling, caught 
the ball fairly in his arms and went 
across the line for a touchdown.
It was one of the prettiest plays 
in the game and one that brought 
the entire field to its feet.
The ball soared within the speed 
of lightning over the heads of the
Pitt crew and had it been shot
In the second half Pitt never was j from a gun could not have gone
within striking distance of the goal straighten- It was the best throw
line. Tech more than held the 
Panther squad even and kept the 
ball in Pitt territory during the lar
ger part of the game. Pitt suffered
that has been made against Pitt and 
one that netted the enemy six hard 
earned points.
It was the wonderful playing of

Basketball League
This season a freshman team is to 
be formed. This team will be inde
pendent of the scrubs and varsity 
and will have regular times for prac
tice in the gym under the supervision 
of the coach. A schedule is being 
arranged by the assistant basketball 
manager. Every plebe who can or 
wants to play should come out when 
the call is issued, as it gives him an 
excellent opportunity to build up for 
the varsity later 011 in his school 
career. There is little doubt, that 
some good varsity material will not 
be brought to light here.
Every fraternity and club, also the 
dormitories, which desires to partici
pate in the inter-club basketball 
league this season should hand in 
their entries to Mr. McCullock as 
soon as possible, in order that a 
schedule can be arranged.

on eqUal division, would ensure each 
activity a working capital ol! $213.34, 
if ho money is appropriated for sink
ing fund.
Furtheimore, if the practice of giv
ing insignia yearly is maintained, 
about $350 will have to be put' aside 
for that purpose, leaving a yearly 
working capital of $505.38.
Since this budget shows that the 
board has absolutely no money to 
spare, they were compelled to refuse 
the request for an appropriation ,for 
the Design School Ball.
In order that the Thistle Board 
may establish their policy and start 
a sales campaign early' in December, 
/the board next considered the re
quests wh^ch the Thistle lias made. 
Owing to increased cost of materials 
and service, the Thistle requested 
that the price of the book be advanc
ed from $2 to $2.50. The Activities 
Board decided that the high cost of 
paper, engraving and printing am
ply justifies this; and accordingly 
fixed the price of the year book at 
$2.50. This, of course, does not ap
ply to those students who purchased 
receipts. for the Thistle at tfie 'jeginning of the year, for that receipt 
is practically a contract between the 
Thistle and the purchaser. The 
Thistle Board, in requesting the in
crease from the Activities Board, 
asked that it tbe made clear to the 
'student body that the increase is ab
solutely necessary and can by 110 
means be avoided.
The second recommendation of the 
Thistle Board was to change the sys
tem of charging all, classes Und or
ganizations for space used. Their 
idea is to let the classes and open 
organizations connected with the va
rious courses have their space free, 
but to continue to charge fraternities 
and other organizations outside of 
the direct purposes of the courses 
of instruction. This idea was prac
tically approved in its entirety when 
the Activities Board adopted a mo
tion to allow1 the 1917 Thistle Board 
to allot space as it sees fit, subject 
to review by the Student Activities 
Board.

When "Hypocrites, the exception
al feature production which is the 
attraction at the Strand, Forbes and 
Atwood, Wednesday, November 29, 
was first presented, to the public, a 
storm of discussion arose that has 
probably never been equaled in like 
circumstances. Both denunciation 
and praise were heaped upon tjie 
producers, principally because Truth 
was visualized in the beautiful nude 
f.orm of Miss Margaret Edwards, a 
famous artists model. The concen
sus of opinion, however, after the 
smolce had cleared away, was that 
Hypocrites" was a wonderful ser
mon, beautifully .staged and with a 
clear cut conception and execution 
of its motive. "Hypocrites will be 
shown but the one day. "Fatty Arbuclcle, one of the most popular of 
all comedians, will also be shown 
Wednesday.
Thursday, Miss Ann Pennington, 
petite, pretty and entirely unaffected, 
will be seen Thursday in The Rain
bow Princess, a snappy, interesting 
story of the circus. Miss Pennington 
is the star of the "Follies, being in

Friday, Charlie Chaplin in Be
hind the Screen, his latest scream, 
in which many of the secrets of mo
tion picture production are exposed, 
will be shown, in addition to Alice 
Brady in "Bought 'arid Paid For, a

play.
Saturday, June Caprice plays the 
leading role in "The Ragged Prin
cess, in which a little girl finds 
riches only to leave willingly and 
go back to poverty when the man 
she really loves comes for her.
Monday, The Wager, with Miss 
Emily Stevens in the star role, is 
the attraction, a picture said to be 
one of the finest comedy dramas ever 
produced by Metro. It is a modern 
Crook drama, and exciting in the 
highest degree.
Tuesday, a comedy drama, The 
Heir to the Hoorah, introduces 
Thomas Meighan and Anita King as 
co-stars. The play revolves about 
three mine owners, who decide they 
must have an heir to their wealth, 
and Meighan is chosen by lot to

Slavonic Ball to be Brilliant 
AffairThese coats are right for men 
who are a bit particular about 
their personal appearance 
And who are not averse to 
linking up good appearance 
with comfort.
Make of splendid fabrics in 
uncommon patterns
And exceptionally well tailorThe Design ball is evoking a great 
deal of interest and the committee 
are being kept busy these days sat
isfying the demands of in
terested questioners. A circular giv
ing advance information on the ball 
has been printed and is now being 
issued by the Design Student Secre
tary, Mr. McConnell.
The date of the hall has been 
changed since the last Tartan issue, 
having beeit advanced one day. The 
definite date is Thursday evening, 
December 14, at nine oclock.
The Slavonic ball will be the fourth 
in a cycle of brilliant costume 
dances given (byJ the students of the 
School of Applied Design during the 
past four years. It represents the 
artistic impulse and free spirit ol 
our student body and is properly con
sidered the most important event of 
the Design school year.
Only registered students of the 
School of Applied Design, and Alum
ni of the school will be admitted. 
.The alumni include, besides those 
who have graduated, anyone who at 
sometime has been a registered stu
dent in the Design School for a 
period of not less than ne year.
Admission to the building on the 
night ol the ball will be by a pass 
showing the bearers name and the 
signature of the secretary of the stu
dent body. Passes will be issued to 
the students by the secretary any 
time before five o'clock of the day of 
the ball upon presentation to him by 
the applicant of a treasurer's receipt 
showing the payment of the yearly 
dues which are assessed against all 
students and, payable in advance, are 
for men $1.50 and for women 75
cents. Mr. Oliver Wilkins is the 
treasurer and only receipts signed by 
him or his authorized deputies will 
be accepted by the secretary as earn
est of payment of dues. Dues should 
be paid not later than Saturday
night, December 9. Similar/ dues are 
assessed against alumni, $1.50 for 
men an,d 75 cents for women. The 
alumni should send their dues to the 
secretary who will then mail them a 
pass for the (bail. In case an alum
nus possesses a wife or a husband 
who is. not an alumnus of . this 
school, passes will be issued to them 
notwithstanding, provided the requi
site duos are paid.
No one will be admitted to the 
ball who does not appear In proper 
costume. The piny of fancy should 
bo evident in the dressing because 
the Slavonic, culture is intensely 'in
dividualistic. and calls for imagina
tion and color. The costumes of the 
following periods are wrong and are 
prohibited: Itonmn, Ancient Greek,
lOllzabothan, Oriental, Chinese and 
fights of any nature. Anyone ap
pearing in conventional ovonlng dress 
or modern civilian dress will precipi
tate a riot. On the other hand, cos
tumes of the following periods and 
countries are right and in keeping 
with the decorative scheme ol! the 
ball, and are pormlssable: Husslan,
Roumanian, Polish, .Austrian and 
Hungarian. Masks will be worn un
til midnight.
The decorative scheme for this 
year's ball outdoeB any previous ef
fort. The complete transformation 
which the corridors and foyer are to 
go through is to resound with vivid 
Slavic feeling, to be full of contrast
ing colors and estatic abandon. The 
whole creationcostumes, lighting 
and decorations* will be truly gorge
ous.
A new feature will be the poludenie 
which is to be served in Sculpture 
Hall as the waning hours of Thurs
day night fade into the matin of Fri
day. There will be a cabaret and a 
generous appropriation has been al
lowed in order to make the dinner 
substantial and it is hoped that the 
net result will be one of rare rev
elry.
Fancy and folk dances of Polish 
origin will be interspersed between 
the regular order of dancing.
For those who cannot dance a spe
cial dancing class under the direction 
of Mr. Karl Heinrich is to be ar
ranged.
Cloak rooms will be provided for 
the purposo of disposing of outside 
wraps, it. is expoctod, however, that 
people will come to the building in 
their costume and not plan to dress 
here.
The Woodlawn avenue entrance 
will be the only entrance to tlve 
! building the night of. the ball. The 
front doors will bo closed.
The Slavonic bull will be a mile
stone it\ the goodtimes history of 
every student who attends. It also 
will be an artistic treat. Since it. 
is being given for and by the stu
dents, every effort which they now 
expend will make tile triumphs of 
the great occasion the more perfect 
and lasting. From now on. every 
person is invited to give freely of his
