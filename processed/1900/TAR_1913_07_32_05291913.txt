Defeats Gr:ve City a t: 1M*
By superior work on the bases and 
speedy fielding, the Carnegie Tech 
team took the second game from 
Grove City 011 Saturday, May 24, by 
a score of 3 to 1. Hines pitched a 
splendid game, keeping the five hits 
of his opponents well scattered, but 
the game was also won by his splen
did support. Although he struck out 
only half as many men as Veach, he 
fielded his position well and had eight 
assists. Lobert and Gearhart helped 
the team out of the only hole into 
which they dropped. In the fifth inning 
with one man out, Conley hit for 
two bases. Veach sent a safe one 
out to left, but Lobert threw to Gear
hart, wrho did some fast relaying to 
Patterson, and caught Conley at third. 
Glenn advanced Veach by singling, 
but both men were left when Thorns 
tap was fielded by Hines.
Bucky Vail missed the train, and 
the outfield was shifted to meet the 
occasion. Lobert was moved to left 
field, Kirk to middle and DeMuth 
went into right garden. Big Pete 
made a sensation by using his head 
at bat. Unfortunately for him, it was 
a "bean ball and he was laid* out 
for a time. Kirk was allowed to run 
for Pete and scored the first run 
of the game, while Lobert followed 
closely.
Patterson replaced Hall at third and 
made a good impression. He accepted 
three chances in fast style, making 
good on all.
The Grove City battery were com
pletely rattled by the way the Tech 
boys ran bases. In the fourth, Kirk 
and Lobert worked a double steal, 
while Veach and Thorn held a con
ference, and the ball.
Patterson opened the game by 
striking out. Kirks tap was fielded 
by Conley, and DeMuth also fanned. 
Hazelwood missed three, then Con
ley was given a base on balls. He 
was left on first, however, for Veach 
and Glenn flied out to Lobert and to 
DeMuth respectively.
Lobert, in the second, flied out to 
Allen, Moorhead struck out then 
Gearhart reached first on a missed 
third strike. Lain went out, Conley 
to Allison.
Thorn walked in his half, and was 
advanced to second by Pattersons 
sacrifice to Hines. Allison and Thorn 
to third by sacrificing also to Hinesi 
and Allen made the third out by way 
of the same man.
Brine opened the third by striking

The Carnegie Musical Clubs wound 
up their eighth season on Monday night 
with a banquet at the Schenley Hotel. 
Although it was advertised as dry and 
informal, it was not uninteresting on 
that account. If anyone was down
hearted he was not in evidence, and the 
key-note of the evening was Good-fel
lowship.
When the musicians filed into the ban
quet hall they found their places had 
been marked by elaborate menu cards 
bearing the names of the respective 
members. The officers were seated to
gether at the head of the table, where 
they were allowed to compare notes on 
the speeches to come.
After the main business of the even
ing had been transacted, the Glee Club 
rendered several of the most popular 
s^ngs of the season's repertoire. Presi
dent Crawford then assumed the role 
of toast master, opening the speech-mak
ing by a word of appreciation of the 
support that the Clubs had given him dur
ing the past year He introduced Mana
ger Hollister as the next speaker. 
Holly reviewed the work of the sea
son and gave an outline of the plans for 
the next year. He promised a trip for 
the Clubs at Christmas time and another 
during the Easter vacation week, as well 
as numerous week-end trips within short 
distances of Pittsburgh. One of the 
two long trips will probably be into New 
York State, and the other into Vest 
Virginia, according to tentative plans 
now laid out. The policy of booking an 
increasing number of out-of-town dates, 
followed out this year, will be continued, 
and the territory extended.
Treasurer F. H. Haaren responded to 
the toast-masters demand for a speech 
and in a few graceful words, at once 
expressed sorrow that the treasury 
would be emaciated and rejoicing that 
the expenditures have been warranted 
by the increasing interest in the organi
zation through an ever-widening terri
tory.
President-elect L. R. Madison payed 
tribute to this seasons executive staff 
and backed up the managers prediction 
for the new season. The remainder of 
the old officers and some of the older 
members of the organization were called 
on and expressed appreciation of their 
enjoyment drawn from association with 
the Club.
Making the rounds of the table, each 
fellow v/as called upon for a short talk, 
and many enjoyable stories and anec
dotes about the Club and other matters 
were told. The evening broke up with

Playing in the rain on muddy courts 
the tennis team went down to defeat 
before Pennsylvania State College 
four matches to two. The match 
was played on the University Club 
Courts last Thursday.
The features of the match were 
the playing of Nevin, No. 1 for State 
College, and the steady work of 
Beeken of C. I. T. Nevin played 
brilliant tennis and defeated Duff 
in the best played match of the day. 
He is the most finished player that 
our team will be called upon to meet 
this year. The week before he de
feated Jones of The University of 
Pennsylvania, the conqueror of W.
S. McElroy of Pitt. Beeken played 
a remarkable uphill game and through 
steady work defeated his more bril
liant opponent. Several times during 
this match Hay needed only one 
point to win.
Douthett showed some of his real 
form and easily beat Irish. Savage 
also played w'ell and gave his man 
a hard struggle.
The team, as a whole, showed a 
marked improvement over their 
previous work and better things may 
be expected of them in future 
matches. The scores follow:
Nevin deated Duff 7-5, 6-1. Irish 
lost to Douthett 2-6, 2-6. Jones de
feated Savage 6-3, 5-7, 6-3. Hay lost 
to Beeken 11-9, 6-8. 2-6. Nevin & 
Jones defeated Duff & Douthett 6-2, 
6-3. Hay & Irish defeated Beeken 
and Savage 6-3, 6-3.

The annual picnic held at Camp 
Louise Carnegie, Saturday of last 
week will be remembered in our 
school history as one of the most en
joyable and noteworthy affairs of the 
year. Owing to unfavorable condi

and early Saturday morning, many

willing to risk Mr. Pennywitts fore
cast fair and warmer and so re
mained at home. However, when the 
special train left East Liberty about 
10:30 it had on board about two 
hundred and fifty of the faculty, stu
dents and friends; others making the 
trip by auto and motorcycle via 
Pittsburg pike and some by other 
trains from nearby towns swelled 
the crowd to three hundred or over. 
The train arrived at Glencairn about 
11:20 which gave little time for sports

What was originally intended to 
be a dual meet between Wesminster 
and Tech has been changed to a 
quadranugular affair, with Geneva and 
Grove City the added entrants. The 
meet will take place Saturday at New 
Wilmington under the auspices of 
the first named school. Owing to in
juries of several members of the team, 
Techs prospects are uncertain. Capt. 
Crawford is suffering from a torn 
muscle and may not be in condition 
to run. Should he not be able to 
take part. Tech will lose ten sure 
points. Mayer, who w^ould likely 
place him in the 220 and 440 dashes, 
has a sore foot and maybe somewhat 
hampered. One or two men are 
troubled with other annoying ail
ments and several of the team are 
on probation. King, one of the star 
high jumpers, is out for the rest of 
the year with a sprained ankle. The 
track team has been followed all 
spring by a jinx, and will have a 
harder fight against it than against 
human opponents. Techs chances for 
winning Saturday depend 011 the 
ability of the cripples to get into 
form.

IS THE HONOR SYSTEM A 
SUCCESS?
it has become the custom for the 
Senior class of the Science School 
to adopt an honor system, that is, 
the instructors do not keep a rec
ord of the mens attendance at 
class, nor observe their behavior 
during examinations. The question 
of adopting this system is now be
fore the Junior class, and it seems 
to be a hard one to decide. Possi
bly members of the graduating class 
can help the Juniors by giving their 
own views as to the success of the 
system this year. To an outsider, it 
dees not seem to have been remark
ably successful, but this impression 
may not be correct.
The Honor System has been tried 
in many universities; in some it is 
working well, in a great many it 
has been a disappointing failure-. 
There are many reasons for this. 
Classes have been too large for all 
the men to know each other, hence 
that spirit of class honor and responsibilty which is an essential 
factor for the success is lacking. In 
some cases it has seemed that the 
men or a few of them really pos
sessed no honor, at least no honor 
in a matter of this kind.
We are told there is a subtle dis
tinction between various kinds of 
honor. It is dishonorable to cheat 
j-ourself, they say; it is perfectly 
honorable for j^ou to allow other 
men in the class to cheat, if they 
so desire. Here is the real reason 
for the many failures of the honor 
system.
Since- President Crawford ad
dressed the Junior class, many iemarks of this kind have been heard. 
One man said if he saw another man
cheating under the honor system, it 
would be none of his business, nor 
would he interfere. If this is the at
titude of the majority of the class, 
it would be far better not to adopt 
an honor system already predestined 
to become a dishonor system.
There is no reason why the system 
should not wTork successfully here. 
Classes are not so large that the 
men are not acquainted w7ith each 
other; on the contrary there seems 
to be a great deal of class spirit 
among the present Juniors. Yet 
each man before voting for the sys
tem should decide for himself the 
question: Can I conscientiously and
honorably allow another man to 
cheat during examinations to cut 
classes at will, to be tardy inces
santly? If he answers this question 
in the affirmative, he has no right 
to vote for the honor system. Let 
him rather vote against it, and thus 
prevent the disgrace of his class by 
a certain failure.
But some students say: That is
no honor system, that is merely sub
stituting student supervision for 
faculty supervision. So it is. Yet 
in intrusting this power to students, 
the faculty are placing us on our 
honor, showing their faith in the 
honor of the class as a whole, and 
believing that no dishonest man 
will be permitted to call himself a 
member of the Class of 1914.
The death of George Hampton 
Smith. 10, last week w-as a personal 
blow to almost every member of the 
Alumni, and of the Faculty, as well 
as to many of the undergraduates. 
During the time that he was a stu
dent, and as an alumnus, Mr. Smith 
had. acquired numberless friends in 
and about the schools,  friends, 
where ordinarily would be only ac
quaintances. His was a remarkable 
personality. Coupled writh the faculty 
of making friends with all with whom 
he came in touch, wras a restless ener
gy and ambition that wyas rapidly 
bringing him into prominence when 
his career w^as cut short.
Mr. Smith entered the Xight School 
of Applied Science in the first class 
admitted to the schools in October, 
1905. He spent the five years re
quired for the completion of the 
course in ' Mechanical Engineering, 
working by day and applying himself 
to the difficult work of the class
room in his spare moments. As a 
student, he took a lively interest in 
undergraduate activities and held 
some of the leading offices of his 
class organization. When the Alumni 
Association of the Schools of Applied 
Science and Design was formed in 
1910. after his graduation, he was 
elected its president. This position 
he held for two years and did much 
to establish its permanency and 
power.
While president of this organiza
tion, Mr. Smith was appointed to pre
sent to Mr. Carnegie the silver plat
ter given to the latter on the occa
sion of his seventy-fifth birthday, No
vember 25. 1910.
Mr. Smith was the first graduate of 
t e Institute to be elected to mem
bership in an American Engineering 
Society, being accorded that honor 
for the design of mill machinery.
At the time of his death, Mr. Smith 
occupied the office of president of 
the Aspinwall borough council, and 
to him is due the credit for many of 
the improvements of that suburb of 
Pittsburgh.
With a life of usefulness just open
ed to him, he was summoned to re
ceive the Well done of his Maker, 
but he leaves a brilliant memory and 
example to his friends.
The Tartan extends its sincere sym
pathy to the bereaved family.
CO,,E1POeDEeCE
[The Editors of the Tartan are pleased 
at all times to receive communications 
from any member of the Faculty or student-body upon subjects of timely inter
est. Such articles as are deemed of suf
ficient interest will be published at the

cations cannot be considered, but the

To the Editor of the Tartan:
The essentially masculine accom
plishment of swearing is, I think, be
ing at present too much exhibited 
hereabouts, at least in public. By its 
very nature should not swearing be re
served for rare occasions if it is to 
relieve satisfactorily our feelings? To 
become profane on trivial occasions 
is, surely, to deprive this remedy 
for human ills of its virtue by degrad
ing it to an inferior use. Washing
tons reputation as a perfect and se
cure artist in the profane was 
gained on two or three occasions 
only, when he felt the frenzy of a 
great provocation. So with Nathan
iel Southgate Shaler. Historians, 
aesthetes and others interested in 
the subject, know likewise that the 
troops in Flanders became immor
tal not so much for the quantity of 
their swearing as for its quality.
Yours respectfully,
H. C. Long.

GETTING IT STRAIGHT.
From a recent article in the Tartan it 
appears that a part of the letter rule 
is misunderstood by some of the stu
dents. This rule states that two extra 
letters may be awarded each year on the 
recommendation of coaches and captains, 
but does not say that a man coming out 
four years will be given his letter. The 
rule follows: Article XI, Section 9. 
Special letters. Two letters may be 
awarded each year to undergraduates 
having participated in Varsity athletics 
but having failed to meet the require
ments named in sections 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. 
These letters shall be awarded by the 
Executive Committee upon the recom
mendation of a majority of the coaches 
and Varsity captains.
By order of Executive Committee.
It was with deep regret that the 
Alumni Association of the Schools of 
Applied Science and Applied Design of 
the Carnegie Institute of Technology,
learned of the sad death of George 
Hampton Smith, and in a special meet
ing, May 21, 1913, the following resolu
tion was adopted :
Whereas, George Hampton Smith, of 
the class of 1910, night, has, on the 
twentieth day of May, 1913,* passed into 
the great beyond, and
Whereas, The members of the Alumni 
Association desire and deem it most fit
ting to express the feeling of loss sus
tained by them at his death.
Therefore, Be it resolved that we, the 
members of the Alumni Association, do 
hereby express our sorrow for his death.
Resolved, That we extend to the be
reaved family of Mr. Smith our deep 
sympathy in this, their great sorrow.
Resolved, that a copy of these reso
lutions be spread upon the minutes of 
the Association; that the same be pub
lished in the Tartan and the Alumni Bul
letin, and that a copy be prepared and
sent to the family of our late member.

INTERESTING ARTICLE BY 
PROF. MACINTIRE AP
PEARS IN TRADE 
JOURNAL
The leading article in the April 
Issue of The Cold Storage and Ice 
Trade Journal is one written by 
Prof. H. J. Maclnthe of the Mechani
cal Engineering Department, on 
Central Refrigerating Plants. 
Prof. Maclntire advocates the adop
tion of the central plant system and 
gives a description of the important 
features necessary for its operation. 
He believes the expense of erecting 
has prevented its development thus 
far. The article also includes a ser
ies of hydraulic pressure drop curves 
and a table for obtaining the capacity, 
speeds, and powers of Worthington 
Standard Volute Water Pumps. 
These are fully explained by means 
of examples, demonstrating their use.
The article on the whole is very 
instructive. Any one especially in
terested in the subject will find it 
well worth reading. We are always 
pleased to notice such an article as 
this written by a Carnegie professor, 
for it stamps him among the best 
in his particular branch of engineer
ing.
TECH MEETS W. & J. IN TENNIS 
THIS AFTERNOON
MHO CLUB MEETING
The regular May meeting of the 
Mho Club was held Wednesday even
ing, May 21st, in room 121. After 
a short business session, the Club 
was addressed by Dr. Lyons of the 
Bureau of Mines, who spoke on The 
Electric Furnace. Dr. Lyons gave 
a very interesting and instructive 
talk, taking up the different types of 
furnaces and comparing their devel
opments, uses, and efficiencies. He 
also compared the electric furnace 
with the combustion furnace for dif
ferent classes of work. After a 
short discussion by the members, the 
Club adjourned to the Club room 
for refreshments.
There will be another meeting of 
the Club before school closes, to 
which all plebes interested in electri
cal engineering are invited. This 
meeting will be a social meeting.
The last tennis match at home will 
be played this afternoon with W. & 
J. on the courts of the University 
Club at the corner of Grant Boule
vard and Forbes street. If the Red 
and Black tennis quartet is as good 
as its other teams, Tech will have a 
difficult task to win. With two close 
defeats sustained at home, it is to 
be hoped the third match will prove 
the charm. Those interested in ten
nis should avail themselves of this 
last opportunity to see the Tech 
team, composed of Capt. Douthett, 
Duff, Beeken and Savage, in action.
BOAT EXCURSION.
Members of the Faculties of the 
four schools, are hereby notified that 
there will be a steamboat excursion 
on the Ohio river Saturday, June 7,
1913. Please reserve this date.
See members of the Social Com
mittee for further particulars.
STUDENTS AMBITION 
FERS A RELAPSE
SUFThe peculiar ambition of a student 
of the Industries School suffered a 
relapse Wednesday of last week in 
the most humiliating manner. t His 
proposition, previously made to the 
Upper Class was rejected in a busi
ness like manner but he failed to 
take the hint hence the result.
The humiliation was severe, to say 
the least, but the example set there
by offsets any likelihood of a student 
attempting any such thing hereafter. 
We believe the students were justi
fied in taking such action and should 
any student at any future time in
sist on introducing a similar proposi
tion he should be dealt with more 
prudently, but in a similar manner.

THE SORE NEED OF AVIATION
By Richard C. MacLaurin, Presi
dent of the Massachusetts Institute 
of Technology.
The problem of flight is one of the 
historic problems in human history, 
and within the last few years the 
progress that has been made toward 
its solution has been so remarkable 
that many are inclined to suppose 
that the whole problem has been per
manently disposed of. However, appreviation of the wonderful advances 
that have been made in recent years 
cannot blind us to the fact that much 
must yet be done, and a knowledge 
of the development of similar 
branches of applied science should 
make it clear that having reached 
our present level, we can go high
er only by attacking the problems 
that remain with the patience and 
persistence of the scientific spirit.
Aerial flight today is either an en
gine of warfare or an alluring sport. 
Men fly mainly for the pleasure and 
the thrill of it, but; before the practice 
can become widespread, as it ine
vitably will, it must be robbed of its 
more serious dangers. Among the 
men who may be expected to bring 
about this desirable condition of af
fairs are those trained as men of 
science and engineers in our higher 
technical schools and universities. 
Many of the more progressive of 
these are already giving consider
able attention to the problems of 
aviation. Some years ago, it was pro
posed to establish at the Massachu
setts Institute of Technology a -special department to deal with these 
problems. It was felt, however, that 
the time for that was scarcely yet 
ripe, and that it would be better to 
begin in a less ambitious way by en
couraging the study of the science by 
the addition of special courses in the 
departments of Mechanical Engineer
ing and Naval Architecture.
As time goes on and men realize 
more clearly the possibilities of ad
vancement in the field of aviation, 
these special courses will doubtless 
grow, perhaps in the same way as 
the great Department of Electrical 
Engineering has long outgrown the . 
days when it was a mere adjunct of 
the Department of Physics.
The course of lectures, as planned 
for the present, deals'with such sub
jects as the following:
1. The early history of the art of 
flying and of experiments in gliding.
2. The methods of research with 
special reference to Lilienthal, Lang
ley, Maxim, Hargrave, Chanute, and 
Eiffel,
3. The coefficients of resistance on 
various surfaces, and problems in
volving the use of these coefficients.
4. The mathematics of flight and 
problems relating to the coefficient 
of efficiency of control systems.
5. A discussion of some of the 
more important modern machines, of 
the present dangers of flight and the 
best methods of improving the art.
3y means of lectures such as these, 
students with a sufficient basis of 
engineering knowledge will be made 
familiar in a reasonably brief period
of time with the more important 
features of the art as it exists today. 
What is especially wanted, however, 
is improvement in this art, and for 
this purpose properly equipped lab
oratories of research must be estab
lished and maintained, and the neces
sary financial assistance afforded for 
the conduct of research by compe
tent men. Lack of endowment for 
this special purpose is the only thing 
that has prevented the establishment 
of such a laboratory equipped as it 
should be with a trained staff, and 
arranged so as to give an opportunity 
for men with ideas anywhere to put 
those ideas to the test of experiment. 
The apparatus required for such a 
laboratory is fortunately not very ex
pensive, as much valuable work might 
be done with very little equipment 
other than that to be found in the 
existing laboratories of the institute. 
An experimental wind channel of 
reasonable dimensions is an essential; 
but once this has been erected and 
proper arrangements made for the 
delivery of a steady flow of air at 
various speeds, an endless series of 
useful experiments may be made that 
should throw light on fundamental 
problems of all kinds. Subsidiary ap
paratus will be required for making 
experiments on the stability of aero
planes, which is the most important 
of all the problems presented, and 
the most difficult to examine by ex
periment on a small scale. A prop
erly designed motor-testing plant is 
an essential for an aerdynamic laborator}^, but such a plant naturally 
finds a place in the Mechanical En
gineering Department of a wellequipped technical college. It is, of 
course, an enormous advantage to 
have such experimentation conducted 
at an institution where there are ex
perts in all departments of science 
and engineering that have any bear
ing on aviation. The aviator may 
have much to learn from the naval 
architect, the marine engineer, the 
mechanical engineer, the physicist, 
and the meteorologist. All who are 
familiar with the problems of the 
science and its recent progress real
ize the debt that it owes to the late 
Professor A. Lawrence Rotch, a dis
tinguished alumnus of the Institute 
of Technology, whose meteorological 
researches must form the basis of 
many practical advances in the art of 
aviation in the future.

THE FOUNDATION OF CLASS 
DAY.
This account of the foundation of 
Class Day as told by my father,
Patrick Tracy Jackson, 38, should, I 
think, be recorded, because few are 
still alive,.who heard it from his lips, 
and the number is rapidly diminish
ing.
Before his time Class Day was a 
wild orgy around buckets of punch in 
the yard. A long buried story tells 
that on one occasion, when for the 
third time his friends put a certain 
man to bed, and by way of precau
tion took away his clothes beside 
locking him into his room they had

hardly got back to the punch, before 
he was seen joining them by the Holworthy lightning-rod. In 1838 the 
faculty determining to put an end to 
the scandal sent word to the Class 
Day Committee that their degrees 
would be taken away, if there was 
dancing, singing, or other disorder in 
the yard on Class Day. Rufus King, 
chairman of the committee and a 
high scholar, at once said he should 
resign, as he could not afford to lose 
his degree; but my father (Patrick 
Tracy Jackson) pointed out that, if 
ladies were invited to Class Day, 
there could be no trouble. This sug
gestion was accepted by his fellow 
committee-men, and adopted by the 
class. The faculty also approved it, 
and to help the plan, allowed them to 
have a band of music.
On Class Day morning the band 
played, and the assembled students 
looked at the young ladies, and won
dered what was to be done next. 
During this awkward pause Professor 
Webster happened to come by, and 
asked why they were not dancing. 
The committee explained they were 
to lose their degrees, if there was any 
dancing in the yard. Professor Web
ster said, I am sure President 
Quincy does not understand the situ
ation. I will go and get him. In a 
few minutes he appeared again with 
old Quin, who, as soon as he saw the 
state of affairs, exclaimed, Music! 
Young men! Young women! No 
dancing! Take partners for a co
tillion! and Class Day was started.
May I add some memories of my 
own? The dancing on the green 
lasted until my year, 1867, when there 
was a single set, but I am certain this 
was the last. It was brought to an 
end principally by the rise of round 
dancing. As a boy I heard it said 
of a young lady with bated breath 
She waltzes, as if it were some
thing brave and a little singular, but 
by the time I reached college, square 
dances had begun to fall into dis
favor. I think the first waltzing at 
Class Day was a little before my 
time, at the fashionable Lyceum hall 
spread, but soon Harvard hall was 
opened for round dances, and tickets 
distributed to the class. The most 
important decoration of the hall was 
the six-oar Harvard shell hung from 
the ceiling.
Another cause of the decay of 
dancing on the green was that it had 
become, unpleasantly conspicuous, 
since Class Day had grown into so

TEAM
Two Games to be Played.
The baseball team will leave to
morrow on its final trip which in
cludes a two day jaunt into Ohio. 
Decoration Day will be celebrated 
with a game against Mt. Union at 
Alliance and on Saturday Buchtel 
College will be played at Akron. 
Tech has met and defeated both of 
these teams earlier in the season 
and should be able to repeat the per
formances.
With DeMuth back in the lineup, 
the strength' of the Plaid team at bat 
will be greatly improved. Pete 
has been known to break up many 
a game with a hit at the psychological 
moment. Tech will be without the 
services of third baseman Hall, who 
has been declared ineligible. His 
loss will surely be felt though Pat
terson will do his best to fill the po
stion of the little star.
By defeating the Varsity occasion
al^, the Scrub team is establishing a 
record that is worthy of more than 
passing notice. There was no game 
last week because Braddock High 
cancelled the engagement. Saturday 
afternoon the Duquesne Reserves 
will play their return game with the 
Scrubs on Leeds Field. The latter 
won a decisive victory in the first en
counter and promise to do so again.

Patterson got on first on an infield 
hit, but was caught off base by Veachs 
throw. Kirk was thrown out by Veach, 
and De Muth flied to Rutledge. Thorn, 
Patterson and Allison were put out by 
Hines, Gearhart and Morrhead.
Lobert opened the ninth with a twobagger, advancing on Moorheads sacri

Excerpt from Harvard Alumni Bulle
tin.
A new experiment in education is 
to be undertaken by the Harvard 
Graduate School of Business Ad
ministration when its sessions open 
in the fall of 1913. A line of special 
training has been prepared designed 
to tit young men for the work of 
secretaries of chambers of commerce
and similar voluntary trade bodies.
In all parts of the country, cham
bers of commerce, boards of trade, 
and similar bodies are being filled 
with a new spirit of activity. In one 
city after another such organizations, 
long dormant, have sprung into new 
and useful life; and the recent forma
tion of the Chamber of Commerce of 
the United States of Amercia has 
given these organizations another 
forward impulse.
Two or three years ago Secretary 
McKibben of the Boston Chamber 
of Commerce and Dean Gay of the 
Graduate School of Business Admin
istration had a conference on the 
subject of training men to meet this 
new condition in chamber of com
merce work; but it was then decided 
that the time was not yet ripe for the 
establishment of such work at the 
Harvard School. Recently the mat
ter was again brought up by Mr. Ed
ward A. Filene, of Boston, and after 
a re-examination of the situation and 
conference with Elliot H. Goodwin, 
95, secretary of the Chamber of Com
merce of the United States of Amer
ica. it wras decided to lay out courses 
for this work and to inaugurate them 
in September, 1913.
The courses as they have been 
planned will give to college graduates 
a well-rounded training in prepara
tion for almost anv type of business 
activity and to that will add special 
training in practical experience of 
chamber of commerce operation.

furthering the activities of chamber 
of commerce work, will be conducted 
in connection with the Boston Cham
ber of Commerce and similar bodies 
in the immediate vicinity. The Bos
ton Chamber has pledged its sup
port, and work is now in progress 
in securing the co-operation of other 
bodies and in finding openings in 
which the young men taking the 
course can have actual practice under 
working conditions.

the singing of Amici" by the entire 
body.
The season, just closed is regarded by 
the members of the Clubs as the most 
successful ever experienced. Twenty 
concerts were given, eleven of which 
were out of town. Twelve hundred 
miles were covered on the trips and four 
nights were spent away from home. The 
number of applicants for places in th; 
Club was larger than ever before and 
the musical ability of those making 
places was on a higher standard than in 
previous years. The music used was of 
a higher class than that usual with col
lege musical clubs and, according to ex
perts who heard the concerts, the rend
ering was of the highest type.
In performance and behavior during 
and after the concerts, the fellows scored 
a decided hit with the residents of the 
towns visited. In many of the places 
they were entertained during their stay 
at private homes, and in no instance was 
anything but praise of the actions of the 
members heard. This means that the 
reputation of the Institute has been es
tablished in such a way that any student 
will be welcomed in those towns.
Under the rather strict rulings regard
ing attendance at rehearsals and con
certs, the Club insignia has been awarded 
to members who have qualified. The in
signia will be given this year in the 
form of a tie-pin bearing the seal of the 
Club. Thirty-six have been ordered, an. 
unprecedented number, and will be dis
tributed to the men whose names are 
given below as soon after June 6 as pos

THE SORE NEED OF AVIATION

large an occasion, not however, either 
large, or public compared with what 
we have now. For instance our 
Class Day Committee in 1867 tried to 
add an illumination to the attrac
tions of the day. This had been 
done by 64, and consisted of a single 
row of Chinese lanterns hung along 
the trees in front of Stoughton and 
Hollis; but w'hen we asked the faculty 
for permission to make a similar 
display, we were refused on the 
ground of unwarrantable extrava
gance, and for many years to come 
the '64 illumination flamed in solitary 
magnificence.
We also tried to find a gas-fitter 
adventurous enough to put our class
number in gas on the front of Holworthy, but in vain, and it wras re
served for the Class of 69 to bring 
to light this columbus of gas-fitters; 
so we were forced to be content with 
the usual large black wooden frame, 
on which the class number was 
spelt out in little glass cups of var
ious colors, each with a modest sup
ply of oil and a floating wick, which 
gave a winking glow-worm effect 
not without an old-fashioned charm.
Amid our many attempts to im
prove Class Day one was of real 
value. Before our day the public 
was kept away from the tree by a 
single circle of rope, so that the om
nipresent small boy had the best view 
of the exercises, and the friends of 
the seniors, wrho were too busy to 
stand and wait, were crow'ded into 
the back rows. John Lindsley, the 
chairman of our Class Day Commit
tee. had the happy thought of estab
lishing an outer enclosure, and issu
ing tickets to the class for the space 
between the ropes, an arrangement 
which blossomed a few years later 
into the extravagance of reserved 
seats. When this inspiration was 
translated into action, the police 
cleared the small boys out of the 
reserved space, and I removed the 
ladies, who were without tickets. My 
job w^as certainly the harder of the 
two.
Another . marked improvement in
troduced in 1867 was due to my aunt, 
Mrs. Asa Gray, who suggested that 
I give tea instead of the usual mid
day spread in this way filling the 
dreary gap between the Tree and the 
Presidents Reception. The wisdom 
of this advice was proved by the 
swarms, which descended on what 
I meant should be a modest little 
tea. This may not have been the 
first tea given on Class Day, but it 
was certainly the first w-hich took 
the place of a spread, and it started 
the procession of teas, which has 
since gone on without a break and 
with ever increasing brilliancy.

CONSTRUCTION
! he Upper Machine Construction 
students of the Industries School are, 
at the present time, getting thorough 
instruction and practical work in auto 
construction, being supervised in the 
work by Mr. Hepburn, instructor in 
Machine. The machine upon which 
the students are working is a second

parts, and considerably worn in all 
working parts, w^hich necessitates a 
rebuilding of the engine and a com
