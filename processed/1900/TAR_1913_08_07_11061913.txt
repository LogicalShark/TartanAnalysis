The Declaration of Independence of 
1776 left a question of government 
hardly thought of. Where did author
ity rest? The answer is contained in 
the name we tookthe United States. 
When we speak of the U. S. we speak 
of a group of independent govern
mental units and there has always 
been a question as to the amount of 
authority each state should give to 
the Federal government, but we are 
not here to discuss Federal powers.
Any locality or municipality withjn 
a state could have power only as the 
state permitted such authority, and 
any activity by a locality was carried 
on only at the convenience of the 
state. The state delegated power to 
governmental units called county and 
city, and has been very stingy in the 
surrender of power. The U. S. needs 
far more power than it has at present, 
and the same thing is true of the com
monwealth.
As cities developed it was found 
that the state lagged behind the needs 
that grew with the cities, and city 
government has not developed. The 
cities have not the real powers neces
sary and have suffered what might be 
called growing pains. At first the 
state took up little matters, which 
led to large abuses. An example of 
this is the city hall at Philadelphia 
which was as great a scandal in its 
time as the Capitol at Harrisburg.
In 1873 it led to the passing of new 
constitution which forbade states to 
pass laws for cities. The state gives 
city charters and the power of the 
City of Pittsburgh is in the charter 
of 1901 with amendments. The new 
constitution of Pennsylvania made it 
impossible to grant special things for 
special interests, but it was scarcely 
done until the Supreme Court decreed 
that the legislature could divide the 
cities into classes, and they got right 
back where they were before and leg
islation of a local nature is still em 
acted.
For illustration, certain capitalists 
wished to build subways and surface 
lines in Philadelphia. They went to 
Harrisburg and in six days a bill had 
passed the legislature granting to 
first class cities the power to give 
grants. A special session of city 
council was called and the next day

Carnegie Tech and Westminster 
failed to reach a satisfactory conclu
sion in their argument last Saturday, 
the result being a scoreless tie. The 
weather was ideal for the gridiron 
sport, cool and clear, but the field was 
soft, and, in some places, slippery. 
The largest crowd that has been in 
the stands this year turned out to 
watch and to cheer the two teams in 
their battle. Under the leadership of 
Savage and Randall, the cheering 
easily outranked the noise at previous 
games.
Carnegie made two attempts to 
score on field goals,both in the last 
quarter. Clair attempted a 35-yard 
placement kick and only missed by 
inches. The boot deserved to win 
the game as it was as pretty as has 
been seen on Tech Field. In the last 
minute of play, Burke tried to dropkick the pigskin over, but he started 
the ball too close to the line and did 
not send it high enough. The kick 
was blocked and was recovered by 
speedy work on the part of Fulmer.
The last named player  shortest
An Interesting moment
The two bands of warriors were as 
cldsely matched as the score indicates.
A slight advantage in attack that was 
shown by the visitors was easily offset 
by superior defensive work by our 
team. First downs were not numer
ous and each side was repeatedly 
forced to kick. When punts were ex
changed Carnegie, through Captain 
Clairs good toe, always gained con^ 
siderably. Forward passes were sel
dom used, but several good ones won 
distances for the home team.
Westminster was within reach of 
Techs goal once in the third quarter 
and missed a touchdown by a narrow 
margin. The ball had been carried 
to within seven yards of the goal, but 
Carnegie held for three down,?. On 
the fourth try, Buckley started a for
ward pass to Cannon, who was back 
of the line. Cannon juggled and lost 
the ball and Burke fell on it for a 
touchback. In the second period, 
Buckley tried for a field goal from 
placement on the 35-yard line, but 
the kick was wide of the mark and 
fell short by yards.

man on the lineplayed a really sen
sational game. He started on the 
first kick-off, beating the Blue and 
White men to the ball and getting 
it for his own team. From that time 
cn, he played as if possessed. Time 
after time, he broke through the line 
and got the man with the ball before 
the latter was under way. Getting 
down under punts, he frequently was 
ahead of his own ends. And when 
a fumble occurred Fats was usually 
the nearest to the ball when the pile 
had been separated into its constitu
ents.
Clairs punting was the other fea
ture of the game that stood out in 
bas-relief. Some of his boots went 
for fifty and fifty-five yards, and even 
against the wind he covered at least 
twenty yards. Lauer had to be taken 
from the game early in the first per
iod, having suffered a dislocated 
shoulder. Oakes, who replaced him, 
was under fire for the first time and 
played a great game. If his future 
is to be judged by Saturdays work,

William McConway will be given 
the honorary degree of Doctor of 
Engineering by the Carnegie Insti
tute of Technology on Carnegie Day, 
November 25, when the Institute will 
celebrate for the first time the birth
day of its founder.
This honor is the highest given in 
the engineering field, and will be 
the first honorary degree given by 
Carnegie Institute. Mr. McConway 
was selected because of his services 
to the community and to the Insti
tute, having been chairman of the 
board of trustees since its inception. 
The honor was voted to him by his 
fellow trustees last spring, and was 
to have been presented at the schools 
commencement, but Mr. McConway 
was in Europe then.
The presentation of the degree to 
Mr. McConway will be one of the 
principal events of Carnegie Day, and 
it is hoped by Director A. A. Hamerschlag that Mr. Carnegie will be here 
for the occasion. The new Machinery 
Hall will be dedicated on Carnegie 
Day and a festival and pageant, in 
which the students are to take part, 
is being arranged by a faculty com
mittee. Director Hamerschlag plans 
to celebrate Carnegie Day each year.
Only two other Pittsburghers, it is 
said, have the degree of Doctor of 
Engineering and these are Julian 
Kennedy and Dr. John A. Brashear. 
Mr. Kennedy received his degree from 
the Stevens Institute of Technology 
and Dr. Brashear from Princeton.
The celebration of Carnegie Day 
marks a high tide of success for the 
Carnegie School. This year over
3,000 students are enrolled, and most 
of the buildings that were planned 
for originally have been completed. 
The grounds about the school are be
ing graded and will soon be finished.

PITTSBURGH, PA., NOV. 6, 1913
-r-nl fho PVo.o,
We mentioned last week the amazing 
attitude of some of this years Plebe 
class toward the traditions of Carnegie. 
Since then the Senior classes, realiz
ing that there must be an improve
ment in this attitude, and that the 
Plebes must be compelled, if neces
sary, to obey the existing rules, have 
published the following notice. It is 
believed that the action of the Senior 
class will be final and unquestioned. 
However, if it is not so regarded, 
other measures, more strenuous, will 
have to be taken. The notice as it 
appears on the bulletin boards of the 
schools is as follows:
Some of the Plebes have failed to 
live up to the traditions of Carnegie. 
This having been brought to the at
tention of the Senior Class, after due 
consideration, the latter have decided 
that all men with Plebe matricula
tion cards must in the future obey 
the following regulations:
(1) They must wear the regulation 
hat until the end of the first semester 
and black socks and ties during the 
whole year.
(2) They are required to give up 
their seats to the faculty and upper 
classmen at all lectures, mass meet
ings and in the club room.
(3) They must not use the stairs 
or toilet at the upper end of the 
building.
(4) They must not smoke on the 
campus, nor in the club room, but 
are permitted to do so on the athletic 
field. (The limits of the campus are 
from the 4Gymnasium on Woodlawn
avenue to the Panther Hollow bridge 
in Schenley Park.)

It is doubtless due to the thought
lessness alone that some students have 
been eating their lunches in the lock
er rooms and halls of the various 
school buildings. The waste paper 
and scraps left lying in these places 
are not only a disagreeable nuisance; 
they may also cause unsanitary con
ditions. Of course, the students who 
have been doing this did not realize 
the evil effects of their action, and 
probably none of them were unaware 
that it has been expressly forbidden 
to eat in the aforesaid places. There 
are plenty of tables in the Beanery, 
and those who carry their lunches are 
at perfect liberty to use these tables 
when eating. There should be no oc
casion for further comment upon this 
subject.
golnIa f-.Vog 
nl fho .o-loaY,
It has always been the custom to 
reserve certain tables in the Beanery 
for the use of the Seniors alone. This 
year under-class men, not only Plebes 
but also Sophs and Juniors who 
should know better, have been eating 
at the Senior tables. This must be 
stopped at once. It is a mark of re
spect properly due the Seniors that 
they should be given special tables, 
and no under-class man can possibly 
haxe a good reason for violating this 
custom.--------------------
.V-lKof fIggnlr,
The institution of Blanket Tossing 
was first established last year. The 
occasion at that time was the fact 
that certain students, after having 
been given several warnings, persisted 
in eating in the locker-rooms. The 
Students Activities Committee pur
chased a blanket, and one noon a 
round-up of the locker-rooms was 
made, and several deserving men were 
given an exhilarating experience. So 
far it has not been found necessary 
this year to resort to this means of 
expressing disapproval of any mans 
actions; but the time may come when 
the blanket will have to be called 
into service again.
There was one bad feature connect
ed with this blanket last year. No 
one seemed to have authority over 
it, and it was uniustly used during 
the very last part of the year, by men 
who had no right to use it, and who 
tossed one or two fellow-students 
for no apparent reason whatsoever. 
In order to avoid a recurrence of such 
an evil this year, the Senior class of 
the Science School has appointed a 
committee to take charge of the blan
ket; to listen to charges against any 
man who may be considered deserv
ing of punishment; and in consulta
tion with one or more members of 
the faculty to pass judgment, after 
having given the offending student a 
right to defend himself. Then if it 
is decided that he is knowingly guilty
of violation of any precedent of this 
institution he will be tossed in the 
blanket. This method will avoid any 
hasty action on the part of men who 
have personal prejudices against some 
student; and will result, we believe, 
in a very much more moderate use 
of the blanket.
JClnIa PaIy, TIyynffoo,
The announcement of the members 
of this years Junior Prom. Commit
tee was made at the meeting of the 
Junior class last Wednesday. They 
were as follows: R. S. Wilson, chair
man; Zesenheim, Pringle, Pentermann, Tilbrook and Weldman.
The Alumni Association of the 
School of Applied Science and Design 
offers a scholarship of $100.00 to stu
dents of the Junior classes of the Day 
and Night School. The basis of the 
award will be scholarship, personality, 
and interest in school activities. Ap
plicants should turn in applications to 
W. F. Welch, Pres. Junior Class, or
H. J. McCorkle in Room 100, Machin
ery Hall.

On next Monday night, November 
10, the annual football dance will be 
held in the Field House gymnasium. 
Because of the size of the floor, the 
tickets have been limited in number 
to seventy-five, but no one who really 
wants to go will be turned away. 
The dance, which opens the social 
season and series of entertainments 
at Carnegie, will be held for the bene
fit of the football team. Several new 
features have been introduced into 
the football season by this years 
management, as the training table and 
silver souvenir medal rewards for the 
scrub players,and these will require 
some extra expenditures over the reg
ular allowance.
Speaking of the scrubs, we should 
be glad to help the school show its 
appreciation of their work. Not half 
enough credit is given to the men who 
are a considerable reason for the suc
cess of the Varsity. The mere fact 
that they are ready to replace some 
regular players does not begin to tell 
their story. A Homeric poem might 
even fail to picture the self-sacrifice 
and loyalty that are accepted by the 
usual student as a matter of course.
No plea is being made for your at
tendance at the dance, or, incidentally, 
for your help in giving some suitable 
recognition to the players of the 
squad, but a good time is predicted. 
This affair will be an appropriate be
ginning for the series which has been 
arranged by the athletic authorities 
for the fall and winter. Look up the 
men with the tickets and make it a 
point of honor to go on Monday, 
November 10.
Kolehmainen set a new American 
record for ten miles of 51:03 2-5 last 
week. He broke all the intermediate 
records between Zl/2 and 10 miles 
also.

Socks Price and his band of min
strel men are rounding into form, and 
by the time the Plebe smoker comes 
off should be at their best.
The Plebes are on the job very 
much and are showing their spirit by 
giving the Upper and Middle Class
men a smoker, which will be held in 
the carpenter shop, and there will be 
a general good time.
The Plebes have arranged to stage 
boxing and wrestling bouts, besides 
lots of smokes and the minstrel show.
Price declares he will have a troupe 
of at least thirty men besides four 
end men which will include himself.

The first meeting of the 1914 Thistle 
Board was held in Secretary Fields 
office, October 29. Editor-in-Chief 
Moore gave a short talk on the duties 
of the Thistle Board, and suggested 
that as there were no night men pres
ent that the members present proceed 
with the election ,of officers, the elec
tions to be approved by absent mem
bers at the next meeting. The offi
cers elected were:
W. M. SheldonBusiness Manager.
Marguerite SpillmanAssistant Ed
itor-in-Chief.
E. S. Rauh;Athletic Editor.
Grace W. GarlandArt Editor.
It is the present intention of the 
board to publish a leather bound edi
tion as was done last year. The sub
scription blanks are to be put on sale 
by the first of next week, and it is 
hoped that the students will get their 
subscriptions in at the earliest possible 
date. The Thistle boxes will be put 
UP in the various schools in the course 
of the next few days. All Thistle 
material should be put in these boxes 
in a typewritten form if possible, as 
it saves time in copying it. The board 
will only be too glad to receive hints, 
or suggestions from the student body 
in regards to this years Thistle, such 
suggestions should be placed in ,the 
boxes and will receive prompt atten
tion from the board. It is hoped to 
get the book to press by the middle 
of February, which will mean that it 
will be' issued at an earlier date than 
formerly.
io-l Voofo, Il fho PVo.o,
That it is the duty of the Plebe to 
show courtesy to Seniority, to cheer
fully do the things required of him, 
and to wear insignia denoting his per
iod of apprenticeship was the spirit 
of Dean Leetes talk to the Sopho
mores on Friday.
If you look up the word Plebe in 
Websters dictionary, youll find that 
it means the common people, the mob.
I think freshman is a better term', the 
new man, the apprentice. I believe 
it is a good thing for the new men to 
undergo a period of apprenticeship 
whether in school, factory or any
where. Here the freshman comes 
from all sorts of institutions. We 
cant expect him to jump at once into 
the spirit and traditions of another 
school.
Again, the freshman has a swelling 
in his upper story, due to being in the 
highest class in preparatory school, 
and I believe sincerely that swelling 
ought to be reduced. In every organ
ization two things are consideerd, 
ability and seniority. We wouldnt 
put a Plebe as captain of the foot
ball team even if he were the best 
player on the eleven.
We dont, however, believe in any
thing that lowers the self-respect of 
the individual, but I believe the Plebe 
should be required to do certain things 
as service. I believe, second, he 
should be compelled to recognize the 
greater privileges of those who have 
been in school longer. I believe also 
that he should wear marks of insignia. 
There should be an apprenticeship 
and the class in it should show this 
apprenticeship.
But I dont believe any method 
will be successful unless all the upper 
classmen help. We dont want the 
Sophs to be policemen on account of 
the arousing of antagonism between 
the two classes. We ought to avoid 
any actions that make the Plebe be
lieve the Sophomores are his natural 
enemy. I have a good bit of sympathy 
for the Plebe who sometimes feels 
he is called upon to resent some things 
not lacked by the entire student body. 
But I havent a bit of sympathy for 
the spirit of the Plebe who knows the 
whole student body wants him to do 
a thing and wont do it.
Again Im not in sympathy with 
the uniform cap. 1 think our ideals 
are different from those of the other 
schools and I think there is too much 
unification already. In one case a 
graduate of the Industries school, 
who is this year a Science Plebe, was 
hazed by the very men he helped to 
haze last year.
At the close of his talk Dean Leete 
answered any questions which were 
asked by the Sophomores, and in an
swer to one he said that he thought 
the Plebes should be notified more 
definitely next year what was expect
ed of them1.

average tailor is called upon so seldom for this work that too 
many of them lack the proper experience.
This store has the enviable reputation of selling more 
evening clothes than all the tailors in Pittsburgh together. The 
makers of our evening clothes are specialists who make no other 
kind, and are skilled to the highest degree in the work. Their 
business is to know what is new and correct for evening wear, 
and provide it.
You can only appreciate how much all this means by trying 
on one of our suits and noting the fit, the lines, the grace, the 
style and the becomingness which characterizes it.

The girls of the M. M. C. S. School 
wish to thank Mr. Frank Haaren, 
manager of the football team, for the 
invitations to two of the games to be 
played this year. Owing to the rain 
on Saturday, October twenty-fifth, not 
many of the girls were able to attend, 
but more hope to go to the next game.
T-yP aoClnIl,
The M. M. C. S. students who were 
at Camp Carnegie, have had two 
reunions, one at Miss Ruby Jacks 
home, and the other at the home of 
Miss Inez Rich. At both reunions 
very pleasant afternoons were spent, 
and the girls are now planning to give 
a big Camping Party some time in 
the near future.

Mrs. Ralph Holmes and Miss Pat
ton, at the home of the former, Fri
day afternoon, October 31, introduced 
Mrs. Thomas Wood Stevens to some 
of their friends at a tea from four to 
six.
Mr. and Mrs. Stevens have just 
come to live in Pittsburgh this fall, 
since Mr. Stevens began his work in 
connection with the Design School. 
Both of them are known to most of us 
through their etchings, two series of 
which appeared a few years ago in 
reproductions in magazines, of the 
mens colleges, done by Mr. Stevens, 
and the Womens, by Mrs. Stevens.
The tea was delightful in its homelike setting, with decorations for the 
afternoon in chrysanthemums and 
pink, its charming hostesses and guest 
of honor, and the comfortable air of 
gracious informality that pervaded 
the whole.

While on the subject of specializa
tion in the modern plant, Prof. Wil
lett wandered to the subject of the 
increasing percentage of women em
ployed. He said that the modern car
toonist likes to show that the woman 
will become the support of the family 
and the man become housekeeper. 
The possibility of such a condition 
did not appear to cause the Professor 
any mental anguish for he remarked 
that the household would then be 
better managed than at present, not 
because man is more intelligent than 
woman, but because he is lazier. He 
believes that the idea of having sep
arate kitchens and laundries for each 
family is a great mistake and leads 
to much waste of money and effort.

Well, a tie is better than a defeat.
The Building Class of the Industrial 
School, under the supervision of Prof. 
Dunnells, accompanied the Western 
Pennsylvania Society of Civil Engi
neers, and an Engineering Society of 
Cleveland to Universal, Pa., on Satur
day to inspect the plant of the Uni
versal Portland Cement Co. The en
gineers of Pittsburgh and the students 
under Prof. Dunnells met the special 
train bringing the engineers from 
Cleveland and made the journey with 
them.
There was plenty of good feeling 
on the train for there was eats and 
smokes going around galore.
The trip through the plant was of a 
very interesting nature. Every stage 
of the cement was witnessed and the 
method of each was explained.

they had secured franchises for all 
entries into Philadelphia. This is the 
most outrageous example of how the 
constitution of 1873 was violated.
Ten years ago Pittsburghs govern
ment was upset by a ripper act which 
took out the mayor because he was 
not in harmony with the state ma
chine. This first aroused interest in 
local self government, or home rule. 
The movement has swung the other 
way and the state government is now 
beginning to take away powers. Now 
there is a special force back of this 
movement to restrict or curb our 
powers, and these are the special fi
nancial interests. Why, the city cant 
lay water mains in a street if there is 
already a private company there!
Home rule agitation is not so recent 
for ten states have adopted amend
ments to their constitutions giving 
entire power to local self govern
ment. Cleveland has adopted a most 
advanced Home Rule charter, the 
most progressive in modern America.
Pittsburgh might just as well learn 
and the biggest question is, how Pitts
burgh can get into her own hands 
the functions necessary for us all. 
Progress will be marked by the pow
ers granted by the legislature, and 
then only will Pittsburgh genuinely 
and adequately promote progress.

The directorate of the Carnegie In
stitute of Technology has arranged 
for further additions to the faculty in 
the Department of Music of the 
School of Applied Design, which 
point to the complete development in 
the near future of the plan already 
outlined for a course of training in 
the use of orchestral instruments and 
the formation of a student orchestra.
The string department of the pro
vided for, classes of violin and viola 
being under the direction of Karl 
Malcherek, and the teaching of the 
cello and bass bing done by Joseph 
Derdeyn. For the woodwind section 
and the French horns the Saudek 
Ensemble has been engaged.
The Ensemble is composed of the 
following: Victor Saudek, player of
the flute; Domenico Caputa, player of 
the clarinet; William O. Schultz, 
player of the oboe; Carl Nusser, play
er of the bassoon, and William Hennig, player of the French horn.
It is anticipated, that in view of the 
special opportunities thus offered for 
the study of the rarer instruments, the 
demand for the privileges of the or
chestral course will be considerable. 
Nor is it essential that the students 
should possess instruments of their 
own, inasmuch as a complete orches
tral equipment has been purchased for 
the use of the institute.

he will be invaluable to the team. 
Balsinger played a remarkably fine 
defensive , game. His hard tackling 
saved loss of ground to our men a 
number of times when the primary 
defense had yielded.
Unfortunately for our chances of 
winning the game, the offensive work 
of the team was inconsistent and de  
cidedly off color. Balsinger and Kesner were the only backs that carried 
the ball as if they intended to get 
through, and they were usually handi
capped by slow interference. The bril
liant interference that has been shown 
in practice was conspicuous by its 
absence. At times the players showed 
what they could do by getting away 
for substantial plunges and runs, but 
these were only occasional. H. Hellstrom played aggressively at center.
Westminster worked a line shift 
play that gained repeatedly for them 
at the start of the game, but, when 
our players had got the combination, 
it became useless. Capt. D. McLaughrey, playing fullback for the visitors, 
put up their best game, but he was 
forced at times to slow up before the 
fierce tackling of the Carnegie de
fenders.
The details follow:
The game started at 2:43, Clair 
kicking off. The ball was recovered 
by Fulmer on Westminsters 47-yard 
line. Kesner lost 13 yards and Kreider 
failed to gain. Lauer was hurt and 
Oakes took his place. Balsinger made 
six yards before Clair kicked. Wher
ry was thrown with the ball 22 yards 
from his goal. McLaughrey gained 
two yards and Wherry 5, but Buckley 
lost six. Wherry kicked to Kesner 
who returned 10 yards to Techs 45- 
yard line. Kreider gained two yards. 
Clair kicked to Buckley on the 21 
mark, then Fulmer tackled Wherry 
for a four-yard loss. McLaughrey 
failed to gain but Buckley made four 
yards. McQuiston punted and Kes
ner ran the ball back 23 yards to 
Westminsters 42-yard line. McCaughey lost four yards on a try at the line, 
and Kreider failed and then lost four 
more on two attempts.
Clair kicked to Wherry, who re
turned five yards to the 20-yard line. 
McLaughrey made three and five 
yards on two tries. Westminster 
was penalized five yards for off-side, 
then McQuiston went out of bounds 
on the 47-yards line. Wherry gained 
four yards and Buckley three, and 
McLaughrey made first down on 
Techs 45-yard line. Wherry, Mc
Laughrey and Buckley made seven 
yards among them, then a forward 
pass, Buckley to Cannon, took the 
ball to Techs 25-yard line. Westmin
ster was penalized for off-side. Buck
ley lost a yard and Wherry was held 
for no gain as the -quarter ended. 
Score: Tech, 0; Westminster, 0.
The Second Quarter.
The period started with the ball in 
Westminsters possession on Techs 
33-yard line. Buckley gained three 
yards then attempted a field goal from 
placement. The kick went low and

failed and McLaughrey lost four 
more.
Buckleys punt was blocked by Clair 
and recovered by Kesner. Kreider 
took the ball around left end for a 
long run to the four-yard line, but 
was called back for stepping out of 
bounds on the 21 mark. Kesner failed 
and Westminster took the ball. Mc
Laughrey and Buckley were thrown 
for total losses of eight yards, and 
Wherry kicked. The ball went out 
of bounds on Westminsters 43-yard 
line. Kreider gained six and three 
yards on two tries before the half 
ended. Score: Tech 0, Westminster 0.
The Third Quarter.
Fletcher was substituted for Trautman. McQuiston kicked off to Welch, 
who returned 10 yards to Techs 40 
line. McCaughey gained two yards 
and Kreider failed. Clairs kick went 
into the stands, gaining 10 yards. 
Buckley lost five yards, of which 
Wherry regained four. A forward 
pass started by Buckley failed. Mc
Quiston kicked to Techs 29-yard line, 
where Kesner fumbled and Cannon 
recovered. Wherry made two yards 
on two tries, and McLaughrey gained 
six. McQuiston made first down by 
carrying the ball to the 18-yard line. 
McLaughrey gained seven more. MeContinued on Page 8
