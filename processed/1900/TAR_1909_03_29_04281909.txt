VOL. Ill, No. 29 PITTSBURG, PA., WEDNESDAY, APRIL 28, 1909 TEN CENTS
THE U. OF P. RELAY CARNIVAL.
The last Saturday in April the University of Penn
sylvania holds its annual relay carnival at Franklin 
Field. This event attracts the greatest attention 
of any of the track and field meets held in this coun
try, for it is practically the only time that all the 
larger institutions come into competition. The 
greatest of rivalry exists between the East and the 
West; at. first the athletic world was composed of 
only the Eastern colleges, but in recent years the 
Western schools have sprung to the fore, and now 
instead of merely having the colleges fighting for 
supremacy, it has resolved itself into a battle be
tween the two great divisions.
When one enters the great amphitheater at the 
University a scene is witnessed that will be re
membered forever. On the monster field we see hun
dreds of athletes, while in the grandstand surround
ing the field are 20,000 people, mostly college boys 
and girls. The U. of P. student body occupy the 
southwest section, and when one of their team or 
teams appears the cheering is deafening, or else 
they make themselves heard by rising and sing their 
Alma Mater. Girard College every year occupies the 
western section, and its cheering is a feature of the 
carnival.
At 1.30 the first e^ent is started, with the Gram
mar Schools of Philadelphia competing, at 2 oclock 
the various high schools from every part of the 
United States put their speed against each other. 
As an added attraction special events, such as the 
100-yard dash, 120-yard hurdle, shot put, hammer 
throw, discus throwing, high jump, broad jump, and 
pole vault, fill in the time between the different 
relays. About 3 oclock the prep school relays are 
run, then from 3.30 to 4.30 the real excitement takes 
place, for the college relays are the most hotly con
tested events of the day. The one-anile champion
ship relays are run off from 4.30 to 5.30, and in
these me fastest time is made, as only a few teams 
compete, and they are the very best from North, 
East, West and South. From 5.30 to 6.00 oclock 
the two and four mile relay championships are held, 
and as the last man crosses the tape in the four-mile 
relay, the crowd dashes across the field to carry a
hero from the field, or rush for a car homeward
bound.
This year the one-mile relay caused the greatest 
amount of comment, and in this the West swamped 
the East for the University of Chicago, University 
of Michigan, and Illinois finished in the order named, 
beating out Harvard and Pennsylvania, representing 
the East. The greatest surprise of the day was the 
defeat of Michigans iounmile team at the hands of 
the Penn. team. This event has been won by 
Michigan for the last six years, in fact last year 
they were awarded the prizes without competing.
This year up to the end of the third relay the race
was nip and tuck, but Michigans third runner led 
at the tape by 40 yards, and it again looked like an 
easy victory for the same old winner as Penns final 
runner was for the first time running under their 
colors, while Michigans end was being upheld by 
their captain, who was conceded to be one of the 
best runners in the collegiate ranks. At the first 
quarter the Penn runner had cut down the lead to 70 
yards, and at the beginning of the half-mile he was 
leading by that distance, but everybody present 
thought he was run out, and the other man would 
sprint and beat him at the finish, but to the surprise 
of all it was the Penn man that did the sprinting, 
and when he crossed the line a winner by 75 yards 
he was surrounded by a thousand students, who 
carried him from the field on their shoulders. The 
enthusiasm knew no bounds, for it was probably the 
greatest track victory that Penn had ever won.
To the Tech students all interest was centered in

their relay with University of Pittsiburg, Fordham 
College, Lehigh, Villanova, and Western Reserve. 
Halferty ran the first quarter for Tech, he beating 
the Fordham man by a yard, while Hatcher, who 
ran second, finished his quarter on even terms with 
the Fordham man, with the University of Pittsburg 
following closely. Capt. Dowling ran third, and he 
ran greatest race of his life, giving Hosey a lead of 
five yards over the Fordham man, with Pitt, Le
high, Villanova, and Western Reserve in a bunch 
about five yards further back. Hosey kept up the 
work of his team mates and won handily by ten 
yards, beating Ross of last years Tech team, who 
was running for the Pitt team, while Fordham fin
ished third, only a foot behind, with Lehigh fourth, 
Villanova fifth, and Western Reserve sixth. Tech 
had run the mile in 3.35 2-5, breaking the record for 
their class. Both Lehigh and Fordham expected to 
win easily, but Tech, though much lighter, proved 
speedier than either. K* m* svBJICR*
jjj PLEBE CLASS |
The coronation of the Plebe (president took place 
last Wednesday at noon. Mr. Lamoree took charge 
of the meeting and by a burst of flowery eloquence, 
quelled the cries of Were hungry, cut it out, etc. 
Mr. Hittner was then called to the front and put 
through a rigorous examination. He stood the test, 
however, and was duly crowned. The character of 
his oratory in the inaugural address was such as 
would tend to make us forget even the fact that 
soup and soft rolls awaited us at the Commons.
We are all anxiously awaiting the doughnuts and 
lemonade. Serve up, Billy.
That convicts cap took a trip to Oakland on 
Wednesday. Doubtless striped headgear will be all 
the rage there in the near future.
Mr. HowerThere must be something to it some
where.
Mr. Dosey (Section B)I guess the whole ball 
team is in this section; at least the best fellows 
anyway. Look at Guyer there.

Absolute silence reigned in Assembly. We could 
have heard a pin drop had any one been bold 
enough to drop it. Miss Smith announced that she 
had a surprise for us, and that we were to meet her 
again at noon to hear about it.
No one could concentrate her mind on lessons that 
morning. When the noon bell rang we all ran pellmtell downstairs to Assembly, some with panicstricken hearts, others calm, but wondering. In a 
moment Miss Smith entered. She told us that after 
school the boys were coming over to a dance given 
for the Plebes only. The dance was to be in the 
Gym, which was being decorated for the occasion. 
Of course we were delighted and thanked Miss 
Smith heartily for giving us such a pleasure. But 
she said, Why, its as little as I can do. You have 
been so good and studied so hard, I think you have 
earned a reward. We all went to lunch laughing 
and screaming with delight. We thought surely 
Miss Smith would ring the bell for silence, but she 
only said, Let the children enjoy themselvesthey 
do not have much fun.
When lunch hour was over we went to English 
and were surprised to hear Miss Fisher announce 
that she had a short love story to read to usone 
she thought very pretty. Would we like to listen? 
Or would we rather recite? It is needless to say 
which we chose.
Next we went to Chemistry. One girl was late. 
She entered with faltering steps and scared face. 
Mrs. Church said, Oh, thats all right, my dear,I 
know you could not help being late. Now you may 
talk all you please, girls, only dont disturb the fun 
going on in the Physiology room. We thoroughly 
enjoyed tiie hour and were sorry when the bell rang.
Perfectly bewildered we went to Social Ethics, not 
knowing what to expect next. Miss West was serv
ing ice-cream and cake, explaining that she thought 
it best for girls to have something to eat in the 
middle of the day. After that pleasant surprise 
there were no more lessons.
We all went up to the Gym and found it beauti
fully decorated, the floor newly waxed and in per
fect condition for dancing. Soon the boys began to 
arrive. We received them in the hall. Many were 
strangers to us, but there was a committee from the 
Faculty to see that we were properly introduced

The Senior Household Arts girls have been much 
worried of late over the mental condition of their 
president. Since returning from a certain wedding 
last winter, Miss Ellis has not been herself. Strange 
actions and mysterious mutterings are the symp
toms exhibited, and her classmates are greatly 
alarmed. Only the other night she alighted from a 
car at Craig and Forbes, and walking calmly to the 
mail box dropped her nickel in the slot! This is but 
one of the things that leads us to refer to the afore
mentioned ceremony as The Fatal Wedding.

Last week Mr. Wood was presented with a very 
unique paper weight in the form of a solidified bis
cuit. It was procured by a Senior Secretail from 
the lunch room, the Senior Household Arts girls 
being responsible for its origin. It is now on exhi
bition in the Book-keeping room, Where it serves to 
keep many valuable papers from blowing around the 
room.
Mr. Wood (stepping into the elevator with several 
girls from the Senior Household Arts class)Fare, 
please!
Miss IhmsenAre we not fair enough?
Miss Harding has been very seriously ill and will 
not be able to return to school this year. It being
so near the end of the terms, the history classes 
will be discontinued. We all wish Miss Harding 
a speedy return to health.
It has been suggested that a hospital be added to 
this school for the use of the disabled members of 
the Faculty. This seems like a good suggestion. 
Such a department would give the Household Arts 
girls ample opportunity to practice their Home Nurs
ing, Dietetics and Invalid Cookery.
The Dramatic Club held its regular monthly meet
ing on Thursday afternoon, April 20th. After the 
business part of the program, the members chose a 
critic, this position to be held for one week only. 
It is a rather ticklish post to fill, but it is hoped this 
will stimulate all participants to their best efforts.
The program this week consisted of portrayals 
of pantomime of some well known nursery rhymes 
and fairy tales. Cinderella won her fairy prince, 
Old Mother Hubbard found her cupboard bare, Silverlocks was enchanted with the bears cottage, and 
Bluebeard terrified his wife as of old. Not a word 
was spoken, but the audience was able to guess each 
number from the dramatic actions of the players. 
The meeting closed after the critic had made a few 
remarks on each act.

The April meeting of the Civil Engineering Society 
was held Saturday evening. Nearly all of the active 
members were present. Mr. R. S. Tombaugh gave a 
talk on railway signals. The history of signal de
velopment and the details of the modern systems 
were well described.
The first trains in England had men who rode on 
horseback ahead of them to let the people know 
they were coming. A little later men were stationed 
along the track with flags, which were used to an
nounce the approach of a train. The invention of 
the electric telegraph was a great step forward. 
But the control of trains was still in the hands of 
men in subordinate positions.
The modern systems of block signaling, as devel
oped to meet the needs of the great trunk lines, are 
automatic in action; the human element is elimi
nated as much as possible and the greatest effi
ciency results.

To-morrow will witness the opening of our new 
field. This is the first complete step we have made 
toward securing something for ourselves, and the 
opening is the more to be welcomed since it has 
been twice delayed.
The ground will be far from perfect and the sod 
is chiefly notable by its absence, but what is there 
belongs to the schools and is a fixture. It may be 
necessary to allow the grounds a period of rest 
after starting the season, and if necessary every 
Tech man should appoint himself a committee of 
one to keep himself and all intruders off in order to 
allow the sod time to get a start. By next fall the 
sod will be in shape and we will have a better 
drained field than W. & J., and will be in away in 
the lead of our older rival on the North Side, who 
has no field at all. If the students will only come 
out now and give the 'base-ball team one-half the 
support they gave the foot-ball team last fall, we 
will have a successful season.
Very few of the student body have heard of the 
death of Mrs. Mamatey and The Tartan regrets to 
chronicle the fact. Mr. Mamatey, during his con
nection with the schools had the respect of us all, 
and we all unite in extending him our sympathy.
While rejoicing in the success of our old friend 
Ross on the track, it would be interesting to 
know whose conscience allowed them to slide so 
easily that provision prohibiting any who were not 
registered in their respective institutions on October 
15th last to compete. Also that provision that any 
one coming from another school must be a year in 
residence. Of course, we may be a Prep school, but 
how embarrassing to be trimmed by a Prep school 
on two consecutive years.

The team won a loosely played game from the 
Wilkinstburg athletics on Saturday, but if it had not
been for the poor fielding of the athletics. Tech 
would have been beaten. Inability to hit was the 
greatest fault of the Tech, team only three hits being 
made from the Wilkinsburg twirlers. McKinley laid 
one against the right field fence for two bases the 
first time up and Fulls got the other two. Kemp
pitched a pretty game up until the sixth inning,
when he had a little ascension and was replaced 
by Stockwell. The Wilkinsburg boys clouted the 
ball often and hard, but Tech played an errorless 
game and held them down. The Athletics came 
close to tying up in the ninth, when, with two out, 
Stockwell passed a man. The next man up hit the 
first ball pitched over right field fence for a home
run. This brought the score up to 76, but the
next man flied out to the outfield and the game was 
over. The final score was 76 in favor of Tech. 
This is the first game Tech has played with an 
empty error column, but they will have to come 
strong on the hitting if they want to win from W. & 
J. on Thursday. This game Thursday opens the 
new field and every one should turn out.

Saturday evening last will always be a memorable 
date in the annals of the fine old class of 13, the 
occasion of the first annual (banquet, held in the 
banquet hall of the Hotel Henry; and if any fellow 
there didnt have a good time, he said nothing about 
it. Mr. Harley iSmith, manager of the Henry, kept a 
watchful eye over every detail; and the success of 
the dinner was largely due to his competent man
agement and friendly interest. Appointments, de
corations, and speeches, all, left nothing to be desired.
The parlors of the hotel are an admirable assem
bling place for a crowd of social good fellows; and 
in them, surrounded by ipaintings and music of the 
finest, the members of 13 gathered from seven 
oclock until eight, when dinner was served.
The presence of Dean Deete and Mr. Frazier, 
Guide, Philosopher and Friend for the Class, were 
essential to the enjoyment which followed. After an 
unsurpassed dinner, the orchestra retired and the 
doors were closed, whereupon our very efficient 
Toastmaster, A. D. Peabody, arose and addressed 
the Class, happily citing the occasion of our coming 
together, and introduced the first speaker, Mr. 
Frazier.
This address dealt with The Attitude of the Faculty 
Toward the Student; and if there was doubt in the 
mind of any one there as to the wishes of our friends, 
the Professors, for our highest encouragement and
success, it was entirely cleared away by Mr. Fraziers 
remarks. He did not steer smoothly away from the 
necessary friction which is bound to occur between 
the older heads and the students, but discussed the 
problem logically; citing examples of the bird, able 
to fly solely because of the friction of the air of a 
locomotive, running swiftly to the desired end by 
means of the friction of wheels on the rails, and of 
the tree which grows strongest standing, not in the 
sheltered forest, but enduring the stress of the fier
cest winds in the open.
It was a well conceived and helpful talk, delivered 
in such a way as to leave no doubt in the mind of 
any as to the sincerity of the speaker.
Mr. Leete then spoke in his earnest and sympa
thetic way upon Some of the things incident to the 
life of a Dean. His message was straight to us, 
and for our benefit, the burden of it being, What is 
it which makes a cultured Man? and Can we pro
duce them in Carnegie Tech? He quoted president 
Elliott on the subject, holding out the great qualities, 
unbounded sympathy, wide affinities, truth, modera
tion and proportion, fearless, independent, deferen
tial and respectful. He then discussed the four 
things which go to make up a cultured man; Capa
city for Social Enjoyment with hard work; Power of 
forming true friends; Increased sympathy for those 
working about us; and Character; and in conclusion 
he said, And the name of our School indicates the 
things the School stand for, C. T. S., Character, 
Training, and Self-Reliance.

encouragement offered in these two addresses will

details of this glad evening together will have passed

work continueth, greater than their knowing.
The other speeches were all to the point. Scott 
spoke with his usual careful moderation, but cyni
cally and with incisive keenness as always, on the 
Faculty. Glass, Our tall, fine looking, dignified and 
efficient Class Marshal, according to Schmitt, dealt 
with Developments in Modern Inventions in such 
a way as to make the Scientific American look like 
the Ladies Home Jingle; Lewis, on Class Spirit, was 
excellent. The old traditions are safe with him. 
Schmitt made a lot of the fellows sit up with his 
remorseless inspection of their inmost private lives. 
Dowling was great on Athletics. That Thanksgiving 
game with 12 is still rankling in his mind, and he 
made a strong call for everyone to come out in ath
letics for the honor of 13. McIntosh, on Prophecy, 
spoke from a lofty height of the Credulous and Un
suspecting Public, and peered with a keen and dis
cerning eye into the future. Porter effervesced a 
little about the Gentler Sex, and our esteemed Prexy, 
iSelheimer, spoke on Afterdinner speaking in General, 
quoting Mark Twain like an old Chum.
Story of the $2.50 gold piece. One of the fellows 
needed money about this time, and his portable prop
erty consisted on a $2.50 gold piece. He didnt want 
to spend it, because a very dear friend had given it 
to him, probably a girl, so he took it to the hock 
shop and got $2.00 for it. Afterward he w^ent back 
and had to pay $2.50 to get it away from Uncle. 
Glass wanted to give someone two dollars to get 
out of his speech, but, thank fortune, he didnt suc
ceed.
The story began and ended with long, sustained 
Carnegie cheers, but when about 10.15, word came 
of the winning of the Philadelphia relay by our man, 
and defeat of our old rival, the demonstration was 
truly worthy of Tech.
Another most pleasant feature of the evening, 
one that warmed the heart of every fellow there, was 
the receipt by telephone of messages of greeting and 
good wishes from the classes of 10 and 12, assem
bled in good fellowship as we were, and we desire to 
express our appreciation to these gentlemen, and

to return their kind regards. A message from 
Doctor Hokanson, of greeting and best wishes for 
future success, was received as his messages always 
are, with cheers and enthusiasm worthy of the good 
office of such a man.
Another message came, during the later hours, 
from the upper floor, in the shape of two dull thuds, 
indicating the fall of shoes, but if the owner of 
those shoes thought to get to sleep because he had 
removed them, we fear he was disappointed and, 
perhaps, grieved. Any way he learned by locomo
tive-like outbursts from below, just how to spell 
Carnegie.
Speaking of Class Spirit, there was lots of it in 
evidence. Peabody, in addition to his good work as 
Toastmaster, arranged the matter of music, four 
pieces in his orchestra, more efficiently than any of 
the rest of us would have found possible. Lewis 
spent the afternoon, which he needed against quizz 
time, in arranging decorations, and we have to ex
press our sincere thanks to him and to the Faculty 
for the use of banners and decorations that made an 
otherwise bare hall look like a Tech club room. 
And Sid Newman kept music and cheer going at the 
piano long after the other musicians had retired.
A good time, gentlemen. A time of inspiration, 
fellowship and encouragement, and lets have an
other as good next year, with every one there.

As we live in an age of progress, it is natural that 
we become accustomed to the rapid strides of indus
trial. and technical training, and it is only when we 
are brought face to face with some of these achieve
ments that we really stop and consider our position. 
We have now arrived at the place where it behooves 
us to say something about the good qualities of 
the boys about to graduate.
The class is composed of about twenty-five young 
men, who have, by their persistent efforts and self 
sacrifice, arrived at the 'point along the way where 
they are about to receive a certificate, signifying the 
completion of their efforts. We all know and ap
preciate the fact that the A. and J. school is the 
open door through which ambitious young men may 
pass and enter on the road that leads to ultimate 
success. So it is with pride that we look to these 
boys, and hope that their future life may always be 
prosperous, and that they will be living monuments 
of the school which they represent, and that some 
day their names will be engraved in the Hall of 
Fame.

the event was thoroughly enjoyed by all. Much 
credit is due the committee, Messrs. Bieler, Buhl, 
Casey, Fredierich ami Linderman, for the admirable 
manner in which the affair was arranged.

Everything is in readiness for the Glee Club con
cert at the Conservatory of Music next Friday, 
April 30th. The Clubs have this season had uni
versal success from a musical standpoint and this 
was especially true of the concert given last Friday 
evening at Greensiburg. The audience was very en
thusiastic and showed its appreciation during the 
entire concert. The whole thing is due to the fact 
that our men are well prepared for their parts and 
have the advantage of a long string of successes 
behind them.
Only two more concerts remain for this season, at 
Duquesne on Thursday, the 29th, and then the big 
finale at the Conservatory on the 30th. Since there 
is no regular school on Friday night, due to the re
ception and exhibition at school, many night men 
will feel able to hear the Clubs this time. Among 
the new material are the Great Divide and Se
ora, iby the Mandolin Club; The Mulligan Mus
keteers and My Curly-Headed Baby, by the Glee 
Club; and the Coppah Moon, by the Octette. These 
pieces have been tried out at various places and have 
fully demonstrated their right to share the honors 
with the successes of the February program.
The Glee Club, from the Womens School, has 
been brought to a high standard of training and are 
fully prepared to show the beauties of the softer, 
more, harmonious female voice. There are a num
ber of well-trained voices in the Club and there is 
little doubt that this departure from the usual col
legiate musical program will be a great success. 
A trio, composed of three of the best singers from 
the Girls Club, will sing a s.pecial number which 
is promised will be of exceptional value.
' The pFatroncSses for the concert are Mrs. A. A. 
Hamerschlag, Mrs. W. E. Gibbs, Miss Anna B. Smith 
and Miss E. R. Stoner.
