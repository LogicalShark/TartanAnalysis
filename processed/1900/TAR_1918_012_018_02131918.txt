Victory and Defeat 
In Games of Past Week 
For Plaid Floor Team
Carroll and Byerly Star for Grove City Defeated Before
W. and J. in 34-22 
Game
GRETZLER ILL
Last Tuesday evening our basket 
ball team journeyed to Washington, 
Pa., to play its return game with W.-J. 
They suffered a defeat34-22. An un
desirable feature of the game was the 
loose handling by the referee, who al
lowed many fouls to pass uncalled. 
This gave W.-J. a distinct advantage, 
since they were considerably heavier 
than our men.
Gretzler was unable to accompany 
the team, due to a case of tonsilitis. 
Pat Hoban started off in his place, 
and Lynn, who has been shifted to the 
varsity squad, substituted Hoban in 
the latter part of the second period. 
Abrams played excellently in the field, 
caging four goals, but his work on the 
foul line was below its usual standard.
Cosgrove and Kofoed played well at 
guard. They are exactly the kind of 
men Tech needs therelight, speedy 
and capable to breaking down the field 
any moment they see an opening. It 
. is usually the case that as many field 
goals have to be made by the guards 
as by the forwards, because Abrams, 
Doherty and Hoban have been held 
down in nearly all of our games by 
such men as Graf, of Westinghouse; 
McLaren, of Pitt; Henry, of W.-J., and 
Bianclii, of Allegheny.
Byerly, W.-J.s center, played a very 
fast game. Carrol, their star forward, 
made thirteen out of sixteen attempts 
for., a foul goal count and caged two 
goals from the floor.
In view of the double disadvantage 
to which our team was set (Double
days loose handling of the, game and 
Gretzlers absence), it may safely be 
said they did excellent work. The 
lineup was as follows: .
W.-J.34. Tech22.

NOVEL VALENTINE PARTY 
GIVEN BY DRAMA DEPT.
The first year students of the De
partment of Dramatic Arts', Design 
School, gave a most enjoyable Valen
tine Party in honor of the upper-classmen in the Green Room, Tuesday 
evening. The affair was first planned 
for Thursday, but owing to the fact 
that four girls from the class are as
sisting in Mrs. Fiskes production of 
Madame Sand, at the Nixon Theater 
this week, and could not attend on 
Thursday, the date was changed.
Everything was carried out in the 
spirit of St. Valentine, from the invi
tations to a personal limerick valen
tine which was written for each guest.
The Green Room was turned into a 
cabaret for the occasion, small tables 
being placed around the w.alls, leaving 
: dancing space in the cente.\ Candles 
with heart-shaped shades, furnished 
-the illumination, which was appropri
ately dim. While the guests enjoyed a 
lunch of salad, sandwiches, cake and 
chocolate, aeries of cabaret features 
were introduced on the stage which 
extends across one end of the room. 
Among other things may be mentioned 
the beauty chorus of four superb Win
ter Garden Girlies (?) who took the 
party by storm. The solo dances were 
very well done.
Dancing by all followed the stunts. 
The committee and those who helped 
with the entertainment worked very 
hard to make the event a success and 
everyone agrees that they succeeded 
very well in doing so.
Small Crowd by 29-17 
Score
ABRAMSLAST GAME
Last Friday night, at the Field 
House, a very small crowd came out 
to see our basket ball team beat the 
Grove City quintet in a rather slow 
game. Our men, apparently certain of 
an easy victory, did not play as well 
as they'have against better teams.
The score at the end of the first 
half was 12-9, favor Tech. This does 
not show how slow the playing really 
was. Both teams found it impossible 
to pass successfully and in conse
quence 'there was a great deal of 
scrambling after the ball.
The second period was faster and 
our five exhibited some of its oldtime form. Gretz got the jump on 
the Grove City center constantly and 
succeeded in working the signals in 
fine shape. Our team played rings 
around its opponents until it was so 
far in the lead that Coach McCulloch 
thought it safe to make substitutions. 
Jim Dohertys speed and aggressive
ness made him the star of the game. 
Gretzler played a fine game for a man 
who had just recovered from illness. 
Hodge starred for Grove City. This 
was Capt. Abramsi last game. He 
has been called into service in the 
aviation section of the Signal Corps.
The Plebe game was cancelled be
cause the Casino Tech men are en
gaged in war work which they found 
impossible to leave. The lineup:

RIEHLES ORCHESTRA
BASKET BALL TEAM TO 
TAKE EASTERN TRIP
This week our basket ball team will 
make the last trip of the season, on 
which it will meet Penn State, Bucknell University and Swarthmore. 
Abrams, who has been called to the 
colors, will not accompany them. Ho
ban will no doubt fill "Leftys berth 
while Doherty will continue his excel
lent work at the other forward posi
tion. Gretzler will jump center and 
KofOed, Cosgrove and Vet Williams 
are all capable of holding the guard 
positions in fine style. Lynn may also 
accompany the five as a reserve center 
or forward.
The schedule is an exceedingly 
hard one, but in view of the good 
work done by the squad so far, there 
is no doubt that they will show up 
well. Penn State has one of its best 
teams in-years. They have not been 
downed once this year, although they 
have met such material as Syracuse 
and Colgate can present. There are 
four veterans in the lineup this year, 
including Blakely, who is considered 
one of the best college forwards of 
the day.
The Plebe team is also booked for 
a trip on Friday and Saturday. On 
Friday they will meet Kislii, who al
ways has a strong team. This will 
mean a fight for our Plebes, but just 
watch them. On the following day 
they will play their return game with 
Vandergrift High, whom they beat a 
few weeks ago, 28-20.

At a special assembly on Monday, 
February 4, the Hon. Jifmes Francis 
Burke addressed the Margaret Morri
son Girls on Thrift and War Savings 
Stamps. A War Savings Stamp Cliapter-was organized. This chapter is to 
be known is the Mary Breed War 
Savings Stamp Chapter, in honor of 
Dean Breed, who is interested in all 
patriotic movements. The following 
committee was appointed to organize 
the chapter:
Florence Bechtel,
Charlotte Tross,
Gladys Fleming.
Over $200 worth of stamps have al
ready been sold to the girls of the 
school.
The Junior Class of M. M. C. S. has 
decided to give the annual Prom,' 
but, unlike those of former years, it 
will be informal and every effort 
toward strict economy will be made.
In these times, when all economy is 
a patriotic service, February 22, the 
anniversary of one of our most be
loved patriots, is a significant date for 
this endeavor to be patriotic, yet 
cheerful.
Miss Dorothy Harlow, chairman of 
the Social Committee, assisted by 
various committees, reports favorably 
on all arrangements for a royal good 
time. The Union will be transformed 
into a place of delight under the deft 
hands of the Decoration Committee, 
Miss Bess Sliarpley, chairman, assist
ed by Misses Ruth Toberg and Gladys 
Fleming. Dainty and attractive pro
grams are being provided by the pi*ogram Committee, chairman, Miss Mary 
Truman, assisted by the Misses Clare 
Todd and Margaret Hollar. Music 
will be furnished by Ollie Riehles Or
chestra, under the direction of Ben

selections. Committee, Miss Bernice 
Kruger and Miss Margaret Lappe.
Last, but not least, the Refresh
ment Committee, chairman, Miss Mar

Katherine Kirk and Elinor Mellon, are 
arranging for a menu of delectables 
to suit every palate, however fastid
ious.
ADDITIONAL GROUPS 
OF SOLDIERS ARRIVE
Last Friday night at 10 oclock fif
teen soldiers arrived at Tech from 
Fort Oglethorpe, Ga., in charge of Cap
tain Bhder and 'a first lieutenant. 
Saturday morning ten more soldiers 
arrived here from Fort Reilly, Kans., 
under the command of two lieutenants. 
Both groups belong to the Medical 
Corps and will be here for one month, 
studying the construction, design and 
repair of automobile engines. The 
cottage has been turned over to the 
soldiers as a barracks.
DESIGN SCDOOL OFFERS 
QUALIFYING COURSES
The School of Applied Design offers 
Qualifying Courses in Architecture, 
Decoration, Illustration, Music, Dra
matic Arts, and Sculpture, beginning 
February 23, for a period of fifteen 
weeks.
The purpose of these courses is to 
awaken talent and stimulate interest 
in the'arts, and to give a greater num
ber of students an opportunity of test
ing their natural ability. In art it is 
most important that the technical 
work commence at an early age. Stu
dents who feel that they have talent 
in one of the arts and hope to become 
artists are urgently recommended to 
begin their technical work at once, if 
they can do so without interfering with 
their general education. The courses 
now offered will provide elementary 
training and special preparation for 
professional courses in this School or 
elsewhere. They are not intended to

COLLEGE PRESIDENTS 
DRAW UP RESOLUTIONS
Twenty colleges were represented at 
the meeting of the College Presidents 
Association of Pennsylvania, held in 
Harrisburg, last Friday. This is one 
of the largest meetings of the associa
tion that has ever been held, and much 
important discussion took place with 
respect to the work of tho colleges 
during the war.
The result of the meeting was a set 
of resolutions that were formally 
adopted by the association to be valid 
during the duration of the war; and 
which will be rigidly enforced by every 
college that is a member of tho asso
ciation. These resolutions were 
prompted by the condition of national 
affairs and by the belief that they 
voice public sentiment.
While the resolutions as drawn up 
appear to be rather severe, the asso
ciation felt that tho present national 
crisis warranted such stringency. The 
resolutions follow:
1. The number of holidays, involv
ing cessation of college work shall be 
reduced to a minimum.
2. Expenses of Commencement and 
other ceremonies shall be reduced as 
far as possible. Celebrations and 
meetings involving travel and expendi
ture of money and time shall likewise 
be reduced in number or omitted.
3.. House parties or other forms of 
unnecessary expenditure among the 
students shall be discouraged.
4. Every college and university shall 
put forth unusual efforts to maintain 
the standards of punctuality, obedi
ence, and mental activity which will 
be required of students after entering 
the military service.
5. No student who continues to show 
habits of neglect, slouchiness, or inat
tention to duty shall be kept on the 
rolls of any college, or university of 
this association, or admitted to an
other institution so listed.
6. Every college and university of 
the association pledges itself to seek 
every opportunity of giving enlarged 
and more efficient service to the 
United States.
NAVAL RESERVE FORCE 
SEEKS TECHNICAL MEN
President Hamerschlag An
nounces That There May 
Be 2000 Soldiers Here 
For Instruction
HOUSING PROBLEM
Another method of enlisting in such 
a way as to remain in school is offered 
through the Naval ReseT'ves.
Dear Sir: 
I have just received an order to com
municate/ with the heads of the vari
ous technical universities in Western 
Pennsylvania in regard to enrolling of 
men who are now students of engineer
ing. I am inclosing you a copy of this 
letter. I trust that you will give this 
information to the men in your Insti
tution who are taking a technical 
course, in order that they may have 
the benefits of thus enrolling them
selves in the Naval Reserve Force and, 
as you will note, they shall not be 
called unless there is a great emer
gency, which the Department does not 
at present foresee. This will re.lieve 
the minds of many of these young men 
(Continued on Page Two.)
When President Hamerschlag was 
in town last Saturday, he announced 
the fact that the number of army men 
to be sent to Tech during the summer 
for special instruction will probably 
be as high as 2,000 at a time. The 
greatest problem facing the adminis
tration is the housing of these men so 
as to provide suillcient quarters as 
near to the school as possible. Some 
consideration is being given to such 
places as Soldiers Memorial Hall, Duquesne Garden, the Armory, and per
haps Syria Temple.
The men sent will be from the avia
tion and ordnance divisions, and for 
the latter particularly special arrange
ments are being made by the Presi
dent through Deans Mott and Connel 
ley and Professors Crabtree and Dosey. The schools are admirably 
equipped for giving instruction in iron 
and steel methods for the ordnance 
men.
President Hamerschlag is to be in 
Pittsburgh hereafter but once a week, 
or perhaps once in two weeks, lie is 
deep in his work as civilian aide in the 
Bureau of Industrial Research, where 
along with some six other prominent 
men he is working to co-ordinate 
methods and industries.
The presence of the soldiers during 
the summer may inconvenience those 
students who will be here, but It has 
been definitely decided to give in
struction to students with this one 
proviso. Before offering n course dur
ing the summer quarter the men tak
ing the course must agree to take it 
togelher, and not half In July and tho 
other half in September.
MYSTERIOUS NIGHT FOR 
P. ANO D. DEPARTMENT
All plans are perfected for tho en
tertainment to be hold under tho aus
pices of the Nile Tech Design Club, 
the youngest club In the Carnegie In
stitute of Technology, but aoveral 
things liavo been undertaken by afore
said organization and Its inlluonce for 
good is manifost In the interest dis
played by its members In their several 
studies.
Owing to the war, which has taken 
a large number of its members, now 
material has been enrolled and with 
it new interest and Us latest venture 
is to influence and persuade the school 
to send The Tartan to all Techltes 
now in the service. This measure, If 
carried through, will placo Tech in the 
fore of all schools In that it will show 
how thoroughly the school remembers 
its many students serving their coun
try.
In regards to this "Mysterious 
Night, interest in this affair by the 
faculty and the students of both day 
and night is at fever heat, which 
seems to foretell that this will  be a 
crowning success. Never in the his
tory of the school have the Daf' and 
Night schools combined their efforts 
in any venture and the outcome is be
ing watched with much interest. And 
this is as it should be, for, working in 
the same course and the same school,

TWO LECTURES GIVEN 
BY MR. HENRY L. BULLEN
Colonel Brooks Coming As 
Professor of Military Sci
enceMajor Lyle to be 
Commandant
NO DRAFT EXEMPTION
Last Wednesday official notice was 
received from Washington that the 
Carnegie Institute of Technology had 
been selected as a unit of the Reserve 
Officers Training Corps. Colonel John
C. W. Brooks has been detailed here as 
professor of military science and tac
tics; he is now on his way to Pitts
burgh from San Francisco, Where he 
has been stationed. Major Lyle will 
continue to be in charge of military 
drill as commandant of the Tech unit.*
Units of the Reserve Officers Train
ing Corps in educational institutions 
were authorized in the National De
fense Act passed by Congress several 
years ago. That act provides that pre
liminary and advanced courses of mil
itary instruction shall be offered in Elie 
authorized institutions. On passing 
an examination at the end of the ad
vanced course, a man graduates, as it 
were, from the Reserve Officers 
Training Corps to the Reserve Offi
cers Corps. However, the trying of 
this examination is a matter of per
sonal choice, and a man is not obli
gated to accept a reserve officers 
commission.
t Consequently, in war times, the 
members of a Reserve Officers Train
ing Corps, such as we now have hero 
at Tech, are not enlisted or commis
sioned in tho service, and cannot claim 
exemption from the draft on that 
ground. However, when a member of 
the college until In tho advanced course 
is drafted, the professor of military 
science and tactics at tho school in
forms the adjutant general of the fact; 
and tho drafted man, of found quali
fied, will be admitted to tho appro
priate school for training officers.
Just at present It Is not known how 
tho It. O. T. C. will affect tho Tech 
uniform, particularly with reference 
to the insignia and lo tho wearing of 
tho uniform at all tlmos.
The members of tho Department of 
Printing were again favored last week 
by two splendid lectures arranged for 
by the Committee on Education of the 
United Typothetae of America. The 
speaker was Plenry L. Bullen, manager I 
of the Efficiency Department of the 
American Type Founders Company, 
besides acting as historian and librar
ian at the companys plant in New| 
Jersey.
Thursday evening he spoke at the 
rooms of the Quotorlght Club in the 
Bessemer Building, on the "One Thing 
Needful to Make Printing Profitable, 
The members of the department were 
the guests of the club and the follow
ing evening acted as hosts at the 
School of Applied Industries. Friday 
evening Mr. Bullen gave a lengthy dis
cussion on Printers Types. He ex
plained the history of the different 
types, how types are designed and 
made, and how they should be used.
Other speakers and lectures in this 
series will be announced within a 
short time.
FIRST SHILLING ISSUE 
BRINGS GOOD RESULTS
If, during l.lio past week, you havo 
soon members of tho faculty as woll as 
studonts ovor at tho Margarot Morri
son School, holding their sldos and oxploding with laughter, you would not 
havo nooded to look much farther Lo 
see a copy of tho Shilling. The fliv.. 
issue of the Margarot Morrison School 
paper was a wonderful success. Every 
copy of the three hundred was sold, 
and the men as well as tho girls par
ticipated in this purchasing. However, 
one man explained, when asked if he 
had bought a Shilling, Tlioy work in 
pairs, and one stands on eacli foot un
til you produce your thirty cents.
The Household Economics, Costume 
Economics and Science Departments 
have certainly done well, and the 
other three departments of the school 
will have to reach a high mark of ex
cellency in order to produce a better 
issue in the spring.
BASKET BALL CAPTAIN 
ENTERS AVIATION CORPS
Followers of the basket ball team at 
Carnegie Tech regret very much the 
loss of Captain Lefty Abrams, who 
left yesterday evening for tho Avia
tion Ground School at Princeton Uni
versity. Lefty is the fourth basket 
ball star to be called from Tech with
in the past few months. The others 
are Foxon, Carey and Levinson. To
gether they would constitute fourfifths of a team that would be difficult 
to beat. The loss of Abrams services' 
is much more regretted when one re
calls his uncanny knack of finding the 
basket from any angle, his splendid 
floor work and aggressiveness, and his 
remarkable ability on the foul line. He 
leaves Tech with the best wishes of 
all who know ,him for success in his 
new game.
M. M. C. S. ATHLETES 
SELECT NEW OFFICERS
At a Margaret Morrison Student As
sembly on February'8, Ituth Ross was 
elected secretary and treasurer of the 
Athletic Association and Lynda Ly

for the head of tennis.
The Athletic Association is making 
plans for a May Festival, to be held

THE MILITARY COMMITTEE ON UNIFORMS
February 8, 1018.
Elio Editor of The Tartan:
Dear Sir:It appears from the editorial in last week s Tartan, 
that 11 statement is ilue from the Military Committee on the uniform 
question.
The specifications for school uniforms, as announced were cer
tainly clear enough and from the range of prices given it is' evident 
that there could he considerable variation in cost conforming to the 
cloth and cut as outlined. These variations come from quality as 
well as from tailoring. *
rt was with the idea of urging students to get as good uniforms 
as possible conforming to the specifications, of course, that the sec
ond notice was posted. We had no idea that such a notice would be 
considered as rendering null and void the original specifications.
Very truly,
J. IT. JAMES, 
Chairman Military Committee,
WAR TAX
We are not certain as to whether or not there have been any 
war tax violations here at Tech in the past lew months, but we sug
gest that the men bade of every dance or entertainment, held in the 
future make very careful inquiries as to whether or not their affair 
is liable lo a lax. The rules regarding semi-private dances, such as 
are usually held here, are not puiI.icuTarly well known; consequently 
investigation lit this lime is very appropriate, and if a lax is found 
necessary it is better to make provision beforehand than to be held 
up over I he all'air later.
POSTERS
The Junior Irom committee were very doubtflil about putting 
up posters advertising their dance. The posters, like most oi those 
displayed on Tech bulletin boards, were made by the students of the 
Design School, and their return is essenlial if the students are to 
receive credit for their work., formerly many similar posters have 
been confiscated by collection fiends, who, through what they consid
er a prank, are literally stealing from other students.
This is just a word of request, Hands off!a word which 
should be unnecessary. The Prom committee are not standing guard 
over their posters, nor making any particular effort to retain them, 
bnl hope that this word will be sufficient preservation. It. certainly 
is a shame that a warning like this should lie necessary either for the 
posters ill question or any other, but we would not mention the matter 
if it were not for the fact that it has occurred time and time again.
DIRECTORS TITLE NOW PRESIDENT
At a meeting of the Board of Trustees, held Tuesday, February 
5th, the title of Director was changed to President in the By-Laws of 
the Carnegie Institute of Technology.
Dr. Arthur A. Hamerschlag has been the chief executive officer 
of the Technical Schools from their beginning, serving under the 
title of Director. It seemed expedient for the purpose of conform

R. O. T. C. AND THE DRAFT
February 9, 1918.
President, Carnegie institute of Technology,
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
Dear Sir:
Replying to your telegram of the 8th instant, you will please 
find enclosed herewith copies of decisions made and now in force with 
reference to draft status of members of Reserve Officers' Training 
Corps units and believe that same will give the required information. 
Yours very truly,
(Signed) G. H. SHIELD, JR.,
Adjutant General.
1. With reference to subject matter as given above, it is anNOTICE TO STUDENTS!
THE
MILITARY 
UNIFORMS
Adopted by the
CARNEGIE 
INSTITUTE OF 
TECHNOLOGY
Beady
Also the Leggins, 
Caps, Sweaters and 
Shoes.
We invite all stu
dents to come in and 
make their selections 
without delay.
nonncecl that in view of the fact that members of the Reserve Offi
cers Training Corps are not obligated to accept commissions in 
the Officers Reserve Corps upon completion of the prescribed course, 
they cannot be held to be enlisted or commissioned in the Service and 
are, consequently, not entitled to exemption or deferred classification 
on such grounds. Sections 49 and 50 of the National Defense act 
clearly indicate that a graduate of the corps is not obligated to ac
cept a commission in the Officers Reserve Corps upon graduation^
2. It has been brought to the attention of the War Department 
that certain officers on duty as professors of military science and 
tactics of educational institutions maintaining one or more units 
of the Reserve Officers Training Corps have submitted to local ex
emption boards certificates in the eases of certain members of the 
senior division of (lie Corps in support of claims for deferred class
ification, under the assumption that such members may be regarded 
as in the military service of the United States. In view of the deci
sion rendered in paragraph 1 of this circular, the issuance of such 
certificates should be discontinued and any certificates so issued with
drawn.
By order of the Secretary of War.
1-1. P. McLAIN.
1. It lias been decided that members of the Reserve Officers 
Training Corps, second year advanced course, who are called into the 
military service under the provisions of the Selective Service Law, 
will be admitted, if found qualified to the appropriate service school 
Ior training candidates for commission.
2. When such members are called into the service, the pro
fessor of military science and tactics on duty at the school or col
lege will inform the Adjutant General oL! the Army of the fact and 
of their qualifications in order that their admittance as candidates 
in training schools for officers may be given proper consideration.
By order of the Secretary of War.
SPRING TRACK PRACTICE TO BEGIN THIS WEEK
Intensive track practice will start 
this week with all the swing and "pep 
Coach Eyman can put into it. This 
season the largest squad ever should 
be o.ut in view of the strenuous con
ditions under which we are now living. 
Every man ought to enter some activ
ity outside of his school work and mil
itary training. If he does not know .to 
what he is best adapted, track is just 
the sport, because here lie can be de
veloped if deficient in certain physical 
requirements to put those capacities 
to work which are lying dormant.
Now, RIGHT NOW, is the time to go 
to work; do not put it off. Monday, 
Wednesday and Friday, at 4:30, or as 
soon after as you can get to the gym.
SENIORS AND JUNIORS 
BEGIN RADIO COURSE
The new Radio Course was started 
in Science School last week. At one 
of their first meetings, the men taking 
the course wero addressed by Lieuten
ant Free, of Washington, D. C., who 
is in charge of Equipment for Radio 
Schools. His talk was largely of a 
contidential nature.
About twenty-five men, eleven of 
whom are Seniors, and the remainder 
Juniors, are at present enrolled in the 
class. Most of them are enlisted in 
the Engineers Reserve. The course, 
which is under the supervision of Mr. 
Work, is intended to train men for 
service in the Signal Corps. The 
work is temporarily hampered by the 
absence of Professor Dennison, who 
is in College Port, Md., doing work 
along the same line.
NEW RADIO COURSE FOR 
MECHANICS TO OPEN
It is expected that 500 men will soon 
arrive in Pittsburgh from the various 
training camps throughout the coun
try to take a three months' course of 
instruction at the radio school of me
chanics to be established at the Car
negie School of Technology in a few 
days. The course, Which isi in main
tenance and repair of wureless appa
ratus on airplaines, will be open to 
men anticipating military service as 
wrell as those already enlisted. It will 
be in charge of Prof. H. A. Calderwood, head of the electrical depart
ment of the Industries1 School, who is 
also head of the war courses and an 
expert from the office of the Govern
ments signal officer;
BASKET BALE LEAGUE 
NEEDS BETTER SUPPORT
Coach McCulloch requests better 
support on the part of the student body 
of the Intra-Mural Basket Ball Tour
nament. The showing thus far has 
been miserable. 11' your manager is 
not doing his duty, as is* chiefly the 
case, FIRE HIM! Theres many a 
man with enough interest in his dor
mitory or section to see that the best 
possible team is* placed on the gym 
floor at this scheduled time.
Even though you have not played a 
game yet, get into it from nowr on and 
see that you win all of the remaining 
games and give Coach McCulloch an 
opportunity to get hold of a few em
bryo basket ball players, the supply 
of which is not over-abundant this 
season.

MYSTERIOUS NIGHT FOR
P. AND D. DEPARTMENT
(Continued From Page One.) 
the several students should know each 
other before they enter the business 
world, as members of the same Alma 
Mater, and not as though they came 
from different schools.
It depends entirely on the students 
of the P. & D. Department of the De
sign School "to make this a glorious 
success and show to all the other 
schools and departments that the day 
and night schools can co-operate in 
many ways and not that one school is 
superior to another.
__T-lie joint committee appointed by
the students are working with much 
fervor and as far as the program is 
concerned, a great and glorious even
ing is assured to all who attend, but 
the contents of the program is a mys
tery. No word is allowed to leak out 
and even a German spy could not find 
out beforehand what the committee 
proposes to do, except that they assure 
all who attend one good time. They 
only require that all the students of 
the P. & D. Department come, with 
smock and Windsor tie. From this, 
one might be led to believe that all 
will be introduced into the Artists' 
Fraternity.
The committee has been asked by 
members of the other departments for 
admittance to this Mysterious Night, 
but all such requests have been flatly 
refused. They say that this is for .the 
P. & D. Department, so all Day and 
Night students should come and see 
what their committees have provided 
for them.
NAVAL RESERVE FORCE
SEEKS TECHNICAL MEN
(Continued From Page One.)
so that they can continue their studies 
and eventually be of much greater 
value to their country than if they 
dropped their studies under an illadvised decision and enlisted in any 
one of the various branches before 
they had received all the possible ed
ucation ihat may, under these times, 
be granted them.
Yours very truly, 
NEWTON MANSFIELD, 
Lieutenant Commander, U. S. Navy, 
(Retired), Recruiting Officer.
The letter spoken of reads as fol
lows :
1. In order to insure the future en
gineering men of the Navy, the Bureau 
desires to enroll under-graduate stu
dent of technical universities in the 
Naval Reserve Force.
2. The Bureau therefore directs .that 
any undergraduate between 18 and 21 
years of age who is actually taking a 
technical course at a technical univer
sity, and physically qualified, may be 
enrolled in the Naval Reserve, class 4, 
for general service, as seamen, second 
class.
3. These under-graduates will not 
be called to active duty until they have 
graduated, except in case of great 
emergency, which emergency the Bu
reau at present does not foresee.
4. No promise of commission will 
be given these under-graduates, and 
when graduated and called to active 
service they will be examined and rerated according 4o their ability and 
requirements of the service.
5. A partial list of technical univer
sities in your district is enclosed liere.with, and you will cause your Enroll
ing and Recruiting Officers to get in 
touch with those universities and make 
such enrollments of the above men
tioned men as may be possible.
G. Make special report to the Bu
reau (letter form).as to /the number 
of men enrolled under the above authirity.

DESIGN SCHOOL OFFERS
QUALIFYING COURSES
(Continued From Page One.) 
duplicate or take the place of similar 
courses now given in the Schools, and 
must not interfere with the regular 
work in any way.
The Design School possesses very 
unusual facilities and a large faculty 
for giving such instruction. By offer
ing these courses to High School and 
Preparatory School students in Pitts
burgh and vicinity, the opoprtunities 
for the study of the fine arts are thus 
considerably increased. Those who 
take these courses will have the ad
vantage of doing at least a part of the 
elementary technical work given in 
the School of Design. It will make it 
possible for them to commence the 
work for which credit towards the 
Bachelors Degree is given, at an 
earlier date.
Students who want to take one of 
these courses must present themselves 
on Saturday, February 16, at 9:30 
a. m., at the School of Applied Design 
with a letter from the Principal of the 
School they are attending, recommend
ing them for admission. They will be 
required to take a simple examination 
or test to determine their fitness for 
the course they have selected. As the 
number of qualifying students who 
can be admitted to each department is 
limited, they will be selected by com
petition. Those who cannot be admit
ted will be placed on the waiting list 
in order of merit. If any students 
withdraw or having failed to do good 
work are dropped from the course, 
others chosen from the waiting list 
will be substituted. Instruction will 
be given on Saturday mornings from 
9:30 to 12:30, from February 23, to 
June 1, inclusive.
An enrollment fee of $5.00 will be 
charged for the course, and must he 
paid in advance not later than 9:30 
a. m., Saturday, February 23. This 
fee will be returned to the students 
whose work has been satisfactory and 
who have been regular in attendance. 
If unnecessary breakage occurs or 
damage is done to school property a 
pro rata amount will be deducted 
from this refund.
No credit for qualifying courses will 
be given towards admission to the 
School of Applied Design unless such 
credit is recommended by the Princi
pal of the School. The amount of

M. M. C. S. DEPARTMENT 
HEAD MARRIED QUIETLY
On Saturday afternoon at 5:30, Dr. 
Charles Watkins, head of the Mar
garet Morrison Science Department, 
was married to Miss Amelia Jackson, 
of Baltimore. The wedding took place 
in the Church of the Ascension, with 
Rev. Jennings officiating, and, on ac
count of the important work which 
Dr. Watkins is now doing in connec
tion with the war, was very quiet. 
Mr. and Mrs. Watkins have taken an 
apartment at 552 Neville street.
At 5 oclock on Thursday evening, 
February T, the girls assembled in 
Recreation Hall previous to the Char
ter Meeting of the Tech Y. W. C. A., 
when, after a light lunch, chairs were 
drawn about the piano for a devotional 
service. The assemblage numbered 
forty-three. Miss Phyllis McMarlin 
led the songs and Miss Marion Keefer 
furnished the accompaniments.
For four or five years there have 
been girls working to secure an assotiation in the school, and those most 
interested are delighted that the 
charter members number fifty-eight. 
Dean Mary B. Breed was first to sign 
the charter and is the only Honorary 
Charter Member. The girls were very 
much touched by her talk to them and 
her advice was that our sucess would 
not be measured by the outward show 
of large numbers and good times, but 
by the influence the asosciation will 
have on each girls heart. The work 
done in small groups of Mission and 
Bible Study Classes will be the back
bone of our association.

In a letter to President Hamer 
sclilag, dated February 4, 191S, Belty Brown, a former student in the 
department of Dramatic Arts, applied 
Design, writes:
Soon 1 shall make my Now York 
debut! I have been given the part 
of 'Bobo in Lou-Tellegens Blind 
Youth. 1 make by bow 0110 week 
from today (or rather, they are go
ing to allow me to play Thursday as 
a sort of dress rehearsal.) li is all 
very thrilling, you know. 
Upperclassmen all remember Miss 
Brownshe was one of the most 
charming girls, it. is said, who ever 
entered the school, and her ability 
was well shown here, especially in 
her excellent performance of one of 
the leading voles in The Liars two 
years ago.

The new organ in the' Music Hall of 
the Carnegie Institute was dedicated 
at a recital held last Saturday evening, 
February 9, 1918, at 8:15 oclock. Mr. 
Charles Heinroth resumed at this re
cital the free concerts which have been 
held now for twenty-three years, but 
were interrupted for about six month:-? 
on account of the additions being 
made to the organ. More combinations 
of stops can be secured on this organ, 
it is claimed, than on any other in the 
world. One of the notable features is 
the attachment to the grand piano, 
which can be operated from the organ 
keyboard.
The program rendered at the dedica
tion was as follows:

BOYS IN FRANCE THANK 
TECH RED CROSS UNIT
The following letters were received 
by the Tech Red Cross Auxiliary 
from two of our boys over there to 
whom Christmas packages were sent 
by that organization:
December 31, 1917. 
Red Cross Auxiliary,
NCarnogie Tech.
Dear Ladies:
It was a most pleasant surprise to 
receive the Christmas Package from 
your organization. It is impossible 
for me to praise too highly the work 
your organization is doing both at 
home and over here. In sending 
these packages you not only bring 
us In touch with Home but also send 
us gifts that are nearly invaluable. I 
have found many Carnegie Tech men 
over here doing their bit and I am 
positive that the Women of Carnegie 
Tech are doing their bit also and 
in a way that is appreciated more 
than I can tell you.
Please accept a thousand thanks 
from me and with kindest regards to 
the students of Carnegie Tech. I am 
Very sincerely yours,
M. EDWIN GREEN.

The Carnegie Tech Red Cross 
Auxiliary,
Carnegie Tech. Pittsburgh, Pa. 
Dear Friends:
I wish to express my thanks for 
the Christmas package which you 
sent to me. I read in The Tartan 
some time ago that the girls of Tech 
had formed a Red Cross Auxiliary, 
and were knitting for the troops, but 
never expected that you would send 
packages to so many of the fellows 
of the Fifteenth at such an early 
date.
My package arrived on January 1st, 
and was among the first Christmas 
gifts which I received from the 
States. I was stationed with a detail 
of twelve fellows, in an old farm
house on New Years Day. There 
was about four inches of snow on 
the ground. The snow was still fall 
ing, and a very ungentle breeze Avas 
blowing from the direction of the 
Kaisef-s land. In the evening, when 
the packages arrived, we were seat
ed around the stove telling stories of 
what once happened over in, -'In
states. The arrival of JJi^Thail broke 
up the circle,,.?jy- changed the topiC 
^.^OftVeTsation in a very few sec
onds.
Every article which you sent is ap
preciated by me not alone because of 
its serviceabilityit surely makes a 
follow feel proud when he thinks 
how hard the students of every 
school oC Dear Old Tech are work
ing for the cause of our Uncle Sam.
1 wish to express my thanks to the 
organization for the good work which 
they are doing, and especially vto the 
individual girls who so kindly con
tributed their lime and effort in knit
ting the articles which were sent to 
me.
Yours very sincerely,

BULLETIN RULES WILL 
BE ENFORCED BY SENATE
arranged in so slovenly a manner that 
a few bold ones attracted the readers 
eye several times, others escaped his 
attention entirely, and altogether they 
presented the appearance of careless
ness and untidiness.
The Senate has done all within its 
power to make the bulletin boards 
neat. The above mentioned rules have 
been passed and posted. New bulletin 
boards have been installed and sub
divided into portions for the various 
kinds of notices. The least the Senate 
can do now is to request that the stu-^ 
dents abide by the regulations passed 
by their own representative body. A
The Science School Senate wishes 
to call the attention of the students 
to the following regulations, passed 
by the Senate 011 November S, 1917:
1. No bulletin boards shall be put 
up in the Science School building by 
any student or organization except 
with the approval of the Senate Com
mittee on Bulletin Boards.
2. All general student notices shall 
be placed on the main bulletin board 
in their allotted places; they shall be 
fastened with thumb-tacks only, shall 
be neat, and shall -not exceed the di
mensions of 10x16 inches, unless 
special permission is received from 
Bulletin Board Committee. All no
tices shall have in the lower righthand corner, the name of poster and 
the date of posting.' All notices will 
be either O. K.d 01* removed by com
mittee. No notice shall be removed 
from board except by poster or com
mittee.
3. There shall be one board for per
sonal notices. This board shall be 
placed outside the Club Room, and 
personal notices, lost and found ad
vertisements, etc., must not he posted 
elsewhere. No notice shall exceed the 
dimensions of 6x8 inches. The date of 
posting on this board shall be placed 
on each notice, and the notice shall be 
removed after two weeks, unless per 
mission for longer posting is obtained 
from the above mentioned committee.
4. The committee shall be em
powered to remove any notice not 
complying with the above rules, and 
shall have general- supervision over 
the bulletin boards of the 'Science 
Schools.
Heretofore these regulations have 
beon completely disregarded. Stu
dents have been posting all kinds of 
notices, of all shapes and sizes, writ
ten in any kind of manner, on any 
kind of paper, and with any kind of 
ink. Four thumb-tacks have seldom 
been used. The name of the poster 
nd the date of posting have never 
appeared on the notice. On the per
sonal notice bulletin, notices adver
tising articles lost months ago are 
still posted. In general, the notices 
on the main bulletin board have been
neat bulletin board means a neat hall.
The Senate Committee on Bulletin 
Boards consists of Mr. L. J. Murphy 
(Senior Electrical), and Mr. J. L. 
I-Ierrman (Soph Metallurgical).
