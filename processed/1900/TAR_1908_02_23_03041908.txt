DR. HAMERSCHLAG SENDS GREETINGS TO TECH MEN
TEN CENTSVOL. II, No. 23fartan
PITTSBURG, PA., WEDNESDAY, MARCH 4, 1908
After having traveled in Europe for nearly four 
weeks, during which time he has visited the larger 
number of the celebrated institutions of learning in 
England, Scotland, Wales and France, and accepted 
the hospitalities of men and women whose names 
are famous in two continents, Dr. Hamerschlang 
has paused long enough in the midst of his busy 
trip to send a few words of greeting to Tech men. 
He writes under date of February 20th, at Paris, 
Ffranee, and says:
When I leave here to-night I will have seen 
many institutions of learning in Scotland, England, 
Wales and France, but greater than my interest in 
them has been my keen enjoyment i meeting so 
many notable men and women whose achievements 
have long made their names familiar in the United 
States.
There is so much to tell you of my trip that I 
scarcely know where to begin, but so that I may set 
your minds at rest I want to let you know that my 
sea voyage was untroubled by illness, and that next 
to roaming the decks and breasting the fine ozone 1 
enjoyed rereading the many kind messages that 
were sent to me and which I take this opportunity 
to acknowledge gratefully.
After nearly a month of absence I am feeling 
our separation more and more each day and I would 
like to wake to-morrow and be with you at the 
Schools again.
The journey has been exceedingly profitable and 
instructive, and as I scanned the faces of hundreds 
of students both day and night, I am more impressed 
than ever before with the fine opportunity we all
have in Pittsburgh to demonstrate the value of the 
pedagogical principles which we are inculcating, be
cause nowhere have I seen so uniformly developed 
that keenness of perception which is the marked 
characteristic of our own students.
There is one attribute, however, which I am 
sure will interest you, and it is almost universal in 
the schools of every rank which I have visited, it is 
the courtesy and deference paid to teachers and vis
itors, it warms my heart when I am feeling very 
much alone in a strange institution to have some 
student stop his hurried walk and offer to place 
himself at my serviceit makes me think the worlds 
akin, and that youth and high hopes make a fine 
prospect when combined with a little unselfish con
sideration.
At one Atelier I unconsciously entered while 
the students were at work and was immediately as
sailed and the apologies were equally profuse when 
they found I was also a student at heart.
It may be that it will be nearly another month 
before I can be home, but every hour I have you in 
my thoughts, so I will be impatient to be with you 
all again, and you may whisper to the other fellow 
that the Director feels more than he cares to write. 
-----------o-----------
Perhaps the bright feature of Friday's event was 
the oration!
* * * *
Among eastern colleges the subject of summer 
base-ball is being discussed pretty freely. The idea 
is gaining weight that a man who is a skilled base
ball player ought to be allowed to market his com
modity just as a student does in any other line of 
work. The eastern college press is strongly in favor 
of allowing students to play summer base-ball under 
sufficiently stringent rules.

Last Thursday provided what was voted the 
most delightful entertainment of an informal char
acter of the year. The lecture omitted in the morn
ing, it became necessary to use the time to the best 
advantage. Thanks to some member of the orches
tra, the bass drum belonging to that organization 
was left in the lecture hall. The moment a snake 
dance was suggested, the project met with instant 
approval. About fifty of the more serious-minded of 
the students formed in a compact line, single file 
with hands on each others shoulders. The drum 
was manned on both sides, and as was altogether 
fitting and proper, tcok the most important and 
conspicuous plac in the rapidly growing procession.
The snake dance performed in such a manner is 
truly an impressive sight. Round and round the 
hall the procession went to the solemn booming of 
the drum. Chanting an apparently endless dirge, 
up the hall they went leaving the instructors gaping. 
The song was unique; the first part of the number 
would lustily shout that some one was a merry old 
soul, to which the remainder took exception in loud 
and powerful language. This statement of popular
ity would be repeated again and again, and as quick
ly and emphatically denied.
If the spectacle was awe-inspiring indoors, it 
was even more so in the open air. Along the road 
they went, the song still ringing. That magnificent 
Hornbosteloleon structure inhabited by the tribe of 
Maggie Murph, was made the objective point of the 
crusade. Reaching its front doors, what was the
luck but to find its occupants not at home to callers.
Upon reaching the lecture hall again an orator
ical contest of the ring leaders was held. Many 
fine and impressive addresses were made and hugely 
enjoyed. After a few portraits of various class nota
bles were drawn on the blackboard, the fun came 
to an end.

On Friday, the 28th, we had a most enjoyable 
hour With Mr. Ben Greet, who talked to us of Shakes
peare and his plays and characters, especially of his 
estimate of women.
Shakespeare extolled Women, for at that time 
they were thought superfluous, except for sewing on 
buttons, and washing dishes. Gut of the one hun
dred women depicted in his plays, there are only 
about six who are of unpleasant character.
From the time of the old Greek and Roman 
plays so long ago, there were none of importance 
till the twelfth, thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, 
when plays called Mystery Miracles and Morals 
were performed under the direction of the clergy, 
to teach the people Biblical truths. A frivolous 
undercurrent became connected with these plays 
however, and so much coarse by-play brought in 
that priests were forbidden to take part.
This was the condition of the stage when 
Shakespeare came to elevate the drama. There 
were other playwrights of importance at the same 
time, but Shakespeare seemed to strike the keynote, 
To hold as twere the mirror up to nature. He 
depicts the emotions of human beings so absolutely 
that his characters are alive to us still.

1910.
The School Days of a Dog.
Among the promising students in a little oneroom school-house in the mountains of Nevada Was 
Raleigh, who was a large handsome shepherd dog, 
and our favorite cattle dog. Regularly each morn
ing he attended school with my brother and I. 
He would follow closely behind us over the trail 
into the school-room, where he would lie quietly 
under a seat, except when he barked at some cattle 
that might stray past the door. :
When the other children saw how well Raleigh 
behaved they decided to bring their dogs, too. One 
morning each scholar, including an Indian boy and 
girl, appeared with a dog. Some of the newcomers 
came willingly enough, but some came only at the 
end of ropes.
All noises were hushed, dogs were pushed under 
the seats, and everything was in perfect order when 
the teacher arrived. The lessons started out nicely, 
but suddenly some youngster, in getting up, hap
pened to step on a dogs tail. There was one terri
ble howl. Every dog jumped from his place and 
started to bark. Instantly Raleigh jumped over
a seat and grabbed the largest dog by the: Heck. 
That was the beginning. Between the childrens 
screaming and crying and trying to get their dogs, 
and the dogs barking and biting each other, there 
was an awful mixup. Lunch baskets were upset, the 
room was one conglomeration of children, dogs, 
baskets, and lunches. The previously peaceful 
school-room looked like a battle field.
* Finally each scholar succeeded in rescuing a 
victim, and peace was restored. The teacher dis
missed school while the dogs were taken home, 
never to return again. Raleigh,' the beginner, and, 
as he thought, the winner, marched proudly across 
the doorstep with his head held high in the air. 
His look at the other dogs, which were being held 
tightly by their owners, said more plainly than 
words, I am the victor.

TRACK NEWS.
The Case of Charles.
Snow and ice have blocked the opening of the 
track season several times; but dont get discour
aged. Come out on the jump at the first call, which 
will be posted at the first sign of fair weather.
The policy this year will be to train all track 
candidates for the 440 up to April 24, when the best 
quarter milers will be sent east with the Relay Team. 
Captain Dowling and Charles are the only exper
ienced quarter milers left from last year, so Green 
Man come out and see if you cant be one of the 
men who go East.
The case of Charles is a very interesting one. 
Before last spring he had never worn a track shoe, 
but he showed the spirit by coming out to try to 
help along and he never quit trying till he had 
won the local Intercollegiate championship quarter 
mile. Now, follow stiit, inexperienced one. Come 
out early, dont quit, and maybe youll be a second 
Charles.
In addition to the Eastern trip, there will be a 
dual meet with Wup May 16, the local Intercollegiate 
meet May 23, a dual meet with W. & J., and probably 
one or two other meets.

College Papers Picture of the Fate of Those Who

One of the college papersit isnt necessary to 
say just which onewas struck the other day with 
the need of getting up a snappy appeal to subscrib
ers. The result was the following:
Once upon a time a man who was too econom
ical to take a college paper sent his little boy to bor
row the copy taken by his neighbor. In his haste 
the boy ran over a $4 stand of bees and in ten min
utes looked like a watery summer squash.
His cries reached his father, who ran to his as
sistance, and failing to see a barb wire fence, ran 
into it, breaking it down, cutting a handful of flesh 
from his anatomy and ruing a $4 pair of pants.
The old cow took advantage of the gap in the 
fence, got into the corn field and killed herself eat
ing green corn. Hearing the racket, his wife ran, 
upsetting a four-gallcn churn full of rich cream 
into a basket of kittens, drowning the whole flock. 
In her hurry she dropped a $7 set of false teeth.
The baby, left alone, crawled through the 
spilt milk in the parlor and ruined a $20 carpet. 
During the excitement the oldest daughter ran 
away with the hired man, the calves got out and the 
dog broke up eleven setting hens.
Moral: Subscribe for your college paper.

William B. Doyle, M.A., LL.B., Assistant Profes
sor of English and Contract Law, is a graduate of 
Amherst College and the Harvard University Law 
School. He came to the Carnegie Technical. Schools 
in the spring of 1907 and entered upon his work 
with an enthusiasm and play of originality that in
fused an interest in the department that prior to 
his coming had been a virtual bugJbear to the stud
ents. His mock-banquets and political conventions, 
his alumni re-unions and class histories supposed 
to be taking place a quarter-century hence, had the 
distinct advantage of novelty and enabled the men 
to acquire the habit of thinking on their feet. His 
policy in his Contract Law classes has always been 
to maintain interest by allowing the men the widest 
latitude in questions and discussion. The last 
few minutes of lectures are often given over to dis
cussions of criminal law and Dementia Americana. 
His krowledge of contracts is not limited to, whether 
coal should be paid for on its higher or lower calor
ific value, but also includes full information on the 
status of the marriage contract.
Professor Doyle is a master of the art of showing 
things in their true perspective as was forcibly 
exemplified in his famous speech on Having your 
bluff called. The aforementioned episode is bound 
to go down in history side by side with such inci
dents as David and Goliath and Napoleon crossing 
the Delaware. This rare ability' of which we speak 
did not go unnoticed before he came to Tech for he 
had served the people in the office of chief executive 
of Akron, Ohio, and was even mentioned for a place 
in the National House. It is said that he could tell 
the story of the golden-haired child swinging on
the gate in front of the vine-covered cottage await
ing her dads home-coming with as melodious a tremulo as Heinroth ever obtained on the Institute organ. 
It is further said that he could make the full-dinner 
pail as realistic as the odor of garlic in the Home
stead cars, and the wrongs of the pee-pul* under 
his deft hands assumed the proportions of the insult 
offered to the young wife when Hubbie makes 
reference to Mothers biscuits.
-----------o-----------
BY THE WAY.
The unpleasant incidents that have been tend
ing toward the complete dissolution of combined 
department spirit are deserving, we believe, of some 
mention at this time in the Tartan columns. The 
exclusion by the School of the Applied Science, of 
two departments of the school and the withdrawal 
of a third, from what heretofore has been consid
ered the yearly history of the student activities of 
all departments, has called forth no end of criticism 
and has brought to a climax the feelings of one de
partment against another that have been playing 
around the lower altitudes, not for one year, but 
since the very opening of' the schools. Although 
the -Thistle has served as an admirable scape-goat 
upon which to focus these forces, it is unfair to 
entertain for a moment the belief that the Thistle 
matter was responsible or even a potent factor in 
bringing about the state of affairs that gives promise 
to dispirit any combined department effort. Petty 
jealousy is so firmly rooted and has become so 
plastic that no effort has yet availed to remove it, 
and, in fact, little effort has been made. Few stu
dents are without the idea that they are a little 
higher in the social scale than the other fellow, 
and others than students have grievances real or 
fancied, that they are quite willing to make mention 
of and so add fuel to the flame. Example is the

BEAUX ARTS AWARDS.
The New York Beaux Arts iSociety announces 
that Carnegie Tech has again taken a prominent 
place in the architectural world. Out of forty-five 
Class B order .problems and ten Class B plan prob
lems, all but six took a mention. Mr. Karl Glockler was 
awarded first mention for Class B Plan, and Mr. 
Louis Stevens was awarded first mention in the 
Class B order problems, making the second time he 
has taken this honor. While Carnegie Tech has sub
mitted only 20 per cent, of the problems she had 
taken one-third of the mentions awarded. The list 
of competitors includes schools from all over the 
country, including Cornell and Columbia.

THE ADDRESS OF PRESIDENT STAMM OF 1911
CLASS AT THEIR ANNUAL BANQUET.
Some men maintain that it is the prerogative 
of genius to be eccentric. There are others who, 
assuming that this is true, think that all eccentrici
ties and fanatical idiosyncrasies may be interpreted 
as genius. This must be the view held by a cer
tain advertising-seeking nonentity named Crane, 
from Chicago.
I don't suppose I need to state in detail the re
marks which have made S. H. Cranes name odious 
to all college men in general and to all true Tech 
men in particular. To summarize briefly, Mr. Crane 
is the man who declared that a college education 
was of no value to a man, and that the Carnegie 
Technical Schools were a $6,000,000 mistake. These 
are some things which tend to become smaller after 
the magnifying effect of their novelty has been dis
sipated by a little after thought. The converse is 
true, too, for there certainly are many things the 
enormity and magnitude of which can be grasped 
only after the expenditure of much deliberation.
I think Mr. Cranes speech is a good example 
of the latter class. That the Faculty recognized the 
true value of the remarks is fully attested by the 
tactful way in which they have officially ignored 
this self-made man who so evidently worships his 
maker.
The students being a trifle slower of comprehen
sion are but now realizing the sweeping dimensions

of the remarks made by Crane, who evidently wishes 
to advertise himself at the expense of Andrew Car
negie.
Mr. Cranes utterance is an insult to our Uncle 
Andy, to Dr. Hamerschlag, the whole Faculty and 
to all the student body of the Carnegie Technical 
Schools, and as such merits all the scorn and con
tempt which may be expressed in words.
Mr. Cranes remarks are a personal affront to 
each and every individual here present, who has 
in the past or present accepted of our Uncle Andys 
princely generosity, and it is up to us to state as 
emphatically and forcibly as we can that we dont 
agree with him, and that we will prove by our lives 
that he is wholly in error. Furthermore, I will 
state that in my opinion Mr. Cranes speech is the 
product of a diseased mind, polluted with a selfish 
jealousy directed against a character far nobler than 
any ideal he ever held.

THE BIG CONCERT.
Next Tuesday night, March- 10th, is the date you 
want to stick a pin in, so that you wont forget to 
be present at the Carnegie vMusic Hall for the big 
doings. That ' is the night of the Carnegie Tech 
Concert, and it is the first chance this year that all 
the students have had to show their support and 
appreciation in an all Schools affair.
The Junior -Prom, is essentially limited to two 
classes of one School, the Smokers and nearly all 
other school functions are limited to the immediate 
classes concerned. Even athletics does not appeal 
to all students. But to what student does a rousing 
college song or the melodious strains of the stringed 
instruments not appeal? Not only should the con
cert appeal to the entire student body, but it is de
serving of the support of every student.
Tickets can be obtained from any member of 
the Glee and Mandolin Clubs and also at the Store 
room, which can be exchanged at Mellors for re
served seats. The first floor seats are 75c and $1.00, 
the first balcony 50c and 75c, and the second bal
cony 25c and 50c.
Tell your friends.
THE YEAR BOOK.
This subject is one with which we are all more 
or less unfamiliar, and it is the intention of the 
writer to make plain to every one the existing con
ditions. There are to be two books published this 
year. One book will be edited by the School of 
Applied Science alone and will be called The This
tle. A book will also be published by a Board of 
Editors consisting of two representatives from each 
of the other three schools (day and night). The 
night schools and day schools are equally represented 
on the board of this latter book which will choose 
its own officers during the ensuing week at which 
time a name will also be decided upon.
It is understood that each faction has the per
mission of the faculty to use the name ihistle, 
but the Students Organizations Committee have 
taken the matter under advisement, and until they 
can bring the matter to an issue, both books are 
seriously handicapped. In the meantime, both books 
are progressing as rapidly as possible and every 
Student in the schools is assured representation on 
one book or the other.

A new schedule for 1910 will go into effect in

The reception was held at 8.30 P. M. and the 
grand march began at 9 oclock, led by Chairman 
Close of the Prom. Committee, and Miss Stehley, 
followed by Junior Class President Sweringen, with 
Miss Chalmers and Senior Class President Hender
son and Miss Stutz. Dancing followed and con
tinued until midnight when a delightful luncheon was 
served. Later the dancing lasted till 2.30 oclock 
in the morning. In the opion of those who attended 
a more complete success could not be desired. The 
committee in charge of the affair consisted of

MODERN STEAM ENGINES FOR ELECTRICAL 
SERVICE, HOTELS, CLUBS, OFFICE 
BUILDINGS, THEATERS AND 
FACTORIES.
A. M. Morse.
The successful steam engineer must keep in 
touch with the continual change and progression in 
the field of prime movers for the generation of elec
tric current.
Steam turbines are already dangerous rivals of 
the large multiple cylinder reciprocating engines 
until quite recently so common in large power sta
tions. In fact turbines have practically crowded this 
type of reciprocating engine out of the market.
Producer gas engines are clamoring loudly for 
proper, and doubtless, entitled recognition, and yet 
with it all, the thoroughly up-to-date reciprocating 
type of engine for medium and high speeds for direct 
connection to generators, especially in sizes ranging 
from 100 to 500 K. W. capacity, undoubtedly retains 
its prestige, and outrivals both the turbine engine 
and the gas engine for the particular kinds of ser
vice referred to in the heading of this article.
The vital characteristic requirements of a prime 
mover for isolated electric lighting and power plants, 
can be grouped under the following haljL dozen head
ings in the order of importance named:
First. Reliability: Uninterrupted service of
the engine is paramount and is obtained as the di
rect and logical result of correct design, the very 
best material and workmanship throughout, intelli
gently proportioned bearings and wearing surfaces, 
and a simple method of positive, continuous auto
matic lubrication, free from trappy and uncertain 
devices.
Second. Economy: This is obtained only by
the happy combination of several elements, em
bracing correct design and construction, perfect 
regulation, the use of improved speeds, steam-tight 
valves and pistons, multiple steam ports permitting 
rapid and properly timed steam admission and free 
exhaust, and the ecnnomical use of steam at variable 
loads, especially the under-load, a condition which 
often prevails in an isolated plant. In addition to 
this the engine must be designed for a system of 
positive automatic lubrication, which permits co
pious oil circulation through the bearings and pins, 
and the consequent elimination of frictional losses.
Third. Quiet Running: As evidenced by the
many glaring failures this is a feature exceedingly 
difficult to accomplish and the engine must be es
pecially designed for such service, th6 greatest of 
care being given to a correct governing device, per
fect balancing throughout, and the valve gear con
struction, which, while without complications shall 
meet the peculiar demands of extreme load varia
tions. The main shaft and crank construction must 
ensure the preservation of the original perfect align
ment, and which has led to the almost universal re
jection of centre erank multiple bearing design, in

favor of the side crank two-bearing construction to 
ensure quiet running after the engine has been in 
service for any length of time.
Fourth. Compactness: The. accomplishment of
this necessarily demands medium or high speeds, 
thus permitting moderately short strokes, thereby 
reducing the overall dimensions, and resulting not 
only in a saving of valuable floor space, but effecting 
as. well a large saving in the cost of foundations and 
of the building, and a saving of labor of the attend
ant.
Fifth. Cleanliness: The reciprocating parts
must be enclosed and protected wherever practicable, 
but without the sacrifice of the convenience of oper
ation and thorough accessibility to the working 
parts; then, too, the elimination of a score or more 
of sight feel oil cups which require frequent atten
tion and adjustment by the operator, has made it 
possible for the engine to be arranged so as to make 
it almost entirely free from the common fault of 
oil slinging.
Sixth. First Cost: Cheap offerings will always
attract a certain class of inexperienced buyers and 
thereby frequently prohibiting attainment of their 
best interests by limiting the price, at which really 
competent builders are forced to withdraw from com
petition, and a trifling sum is saved in the first cost 
at a disastrous ultimate cost, almost sure to result 
in expensive repairs sooner or later, coupled with 
interrupted service and consequent serious loss 
thereby, as well as etravagant wate of steam; many 
such installations are in evidence as a warning 
against buying too cheap.The National Engineer.
