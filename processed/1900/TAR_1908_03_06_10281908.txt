HI, No. G PITTSBURG, PA., WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 28, 1908TEN CENTS
ALLEGHENY GAME
We wiped out the bitter taste of our defeat last 
year on Saturday, although we didnt roll up the 
score that some had expected. The game wasnt 
quite as interesting from a spectators point of view, 
as some of the more open ones, but was interesting 
enough for all that. The team has improved im
mensely, and in the last game played showed an in
clination to do what they are urged to do, get to
gether and pull the man along who is carrying the 
ball. Both the touchdowns were made ir. the first 
half, and after they had been made there seemed 
to be a let-up on the part of the entire team, and a 
great many thought that Allegheny had a little the 
better of the argument in the last part of the half. 
Hittners running back of punts and the hard line 
plunges of all the backs features of the game. Billy 
Hittner managed to lose all his shirt, but the neck 
band early in the game, but didnt let that worry him, 
as he came back stronger than ever when he had 
donned a new one. Framptons boot was working 
considerably better than at any time this season.
Hittner opened by kicking to Stewart on the 15- 
yard line, who was downed in his tracks. Minor 
carried the ball around left end for ten yards and 
was downed by Hittner, who made a pretty tackle. 
Stewart punted to Hittner, who returned the ball ten 
yards. Tech fumbled, but recovered the ball on 
downs. Allegheny was penalized ten yards. Alle
gheny recovered the ball on downs. Stewart punted 
to Roura, who returned the ball 20 yards. Two suc
cessive line plunges resulted in no gain for Tech.
Frampton punted to the 20-yard line. Allegheny 
was penalized 15 yards for an illegal forward pass. 
Tech gained three around left end. Hittner received 
the ball on a punt and returned 30 yards. With the
ball on Allegheny's 15-yard line, Dowling plunged 
through center for 13 yards, landing the ball on the 
two-yard line. Frampton crossed the line for a 
touchdown. Hittner failed at goal. Score: Tech, 5; 
Allegheny, 0.
Stewart kicked to Hittner, who returned 15 yards, 
landing the ball on Techs 35-yard line. Dowling 
gained eight through the line. Dowling was hurt, 
Schmucker taking his place. Frampton punted to 
the middle of the field and Allegheny was penalized
15 yards. Leffiel punted to Hittner, who returned 
the ball 20 yards. With the ball on Alleghenys 
30-yard line three line plunges netted the locals ten 
yards, making first down. Frampton plunged 
through the line for ten yards. Roura made five 
yards, and on the next attempt crossed the line. 
Hittner kicked goal. Score: Tech, 11; Allegheny, 0.
The second half was more nearly even, but wre 
were kept from scoring by one or two unfortunate 
penalties. One commendable thing was the almost 
entire absence of penalizations for holding in our 
line. Line-up:

4THE TARTAN
WASHINGTON GENEROUS
TO THE 1909 EXPOSITION.
State Has Given Over a Million DollarsMost of It 
Used on Permanent BuildingsThree 
New Structures Under Way.
The State of Washington will erect three buildings 
on the grounds of the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposi
tion out of the direct State appropriation for the Ex
position. Work began several weeks ago on the 
first of these, the State Building, in which many of 
the counties will leave exhibits and the various 
boards of trade, chambers of commerce and com
mercial clubs will make displays. This building 
will be a permanent one to be turned over to the 
University of Washington after the Exposition. 
The contract for the foundation and building was 
$58,340, this not including the interior marble work, 
the plumbing, heating and lighting and the great 
bronze doors. It will be one of the most attractive 
buildings on the grounds and will stand opposite 
the Oregon and Forestry buildings.
Work on the other two State buildings will start 
immediately. These are the Forestry and Womans 
buildings. The great logs for the Forestry building 
pre being cut by the lumbermen now. The 
Womans building will be practically permanent and 
at the conclusion of the Exposition will be used by 
the University women as a club building.
The State of Washington has been generous to 
the extreme in its aid of the Exposition. A special 
appropriation of $600,000 was made for permanent 
buildings for the University to be used by the Ex
position. These buildings are Auditorium, Fine 
Arts building, Machinery Hall and Power Plant. In 
addition to this was the direct appropriation of 
$400,000 to come from sale of shore lands, and this 
sum will reach over $500,000 in the end. A greater 
part of this will go into permanent work which will 
be turned over to the University. Each county of 
the State has made appropriations for exhibits and 
four counties will have separate buildings, one that 
of King county, costing $50,000.
INDUSTRIALS.
There doesnt want to be any discord among the 
cheer leaders for the big day. Smother any possi
ble bit of class distinction and lets all get together 
and frame up a long line of good yells, shoot it at 
em red hot, all in unison, and they will think a vol
ley from the Pacific Fleet hit em all at once.
Everybody is glad when forging hour comes 
around. No matter how much you hate to turn 
-------------- or make square and round points, the gen
ial Mr. Taylor is always there with some keen criti
cism that more than offsets any harm done by burns 
or swallowed clinkers, which is invariably the lot of 
the over-anxious Industrials.
RED, YELLOW, GREEN AND BLUE.
TuneWhen Johnny Comes Marching Home.
Dear Tech, to thee our song we raise,
Hurrah, Hurrah. 
And to thy heroes give all praise,
Hurrah, Hurrah. 
We love each brave and fearless lad,
Defenders of the Tartan Plaid,
With a Rah, Rah, Rah,
Red, yellow, green and blue.
Our braves are out to win the game,
Hurrah, Hurrah. 
Theyre fighting for the Tartan fame,
Hurrah, Hurrah. 
Well cheer in sun and well cheer in rain,
Well cheer them whether they lose or gain, 
With a Rah, Rah, Rah,
Red, yellow, green and blue.
A touch down is the battle cry,
Hurrah, Hurrah. 
Whatever the odds, we neer say die,
Hurrah, Hurrah. 
To us our Tartan warriors bold 
Are better than all the knights of old,
With a Rah, Rah, Rah,
Red, yellow, green and blue,
Dear Tech, our hearts are all with you,
Hurrah, Hurrah. 
And to thy name well ere be true,
Hurrah, Hurrah. 
And always, though our hearts be sad,
We hail with joy the Tartan Plaid,
With a Rah, Rah, Rah,
Red, yellow, green and blue.
SOUVENIR OF THE BIG GAME.
The Souvenir Program issued for the Penn-Tech 
game next Saturday is a thing of beauty and well 
worth preserving as a fitting souvenir of Techs big 
game. It contains half-tone engravings of Captain 
Wm. Hollenbach and Head Coach Metzgar, of Penn
sylvania; Captain Wink Dowling and Head Coach 
Knox of Tech, and a splendid cut of each team. 
There are diagrams of the field for following the 
course of the ball and spaces for keeping an item
ized score, as well as the alterations in the foot-ball 
rules for 1908. The program will sell for 10 cents.
A score board is located in a conspicuous part of 
the field upon which will be recorded each play as 
made, showing the position of the player making the 
gain, so that by reference to the program it will be 
easy to note who is making the gains for their re
spective teams.
The score of the game between University of 
Pittsburgh and St. Louis University will also be 
announced.

THE TARTAN5
1912.
Like Caesar, they came and they saw, but at this 
point the similarity of the Class of 1913 and our old 
friend Julius breaks. For, in addition to coming 
and taking a look, did not J. C. do a little conquer
ing? And what did the lads of 13 do? That is a 
question which they have not been able to answer 
even to their own satisfaction. Why didnt you 
stick together, fellows? Well, I thought we could 
do better than that; they walked all over us. I 
wonder how they ever managed to get into the 
room (this in great surprise). Those fellows (the 
1912 boys) certainly know how to manage a class 
rush, and many others in like vein are the remarks 
they are saying to each other.
Well, fellows, we will confess that we were sur
prised. We didnt expect such an easy victory. 
Why 1911 did a little better than you. When we at
tacked that class last fall they made it interesting,
but when we tried you --------. Why do you know
that some of our fellows nearly fell asleep. You 
appear to be rather surprised yourselves at the 
showing you made. Well, we are not only surprised 
but are also ashamed. Yes, little ones, we are 
ashamed of you. We thought that those ex-12 boys 
who are with you would make it lively. But, alas,
and alack, it seems that when they left this class
they left all their grit and pluck behind.
The Rush in Detail.
1912 attacked 13 before their meeting had been 
called to order, and 13 rushed to the support of 
their door-keepers. 12 managed to get the transoms 
open and Cole immediately gave 13 several free 
samples of H-2 S. Right here, we might state that 
we are in a position to deliver this article to 13 at 
any time they may be in need of it. Merely a hand
ful of our men were at the door, the main body get
ting in at the rear so quickly that they were all in 
the room before 13 were aware of the fact. Lights
out. Everybody was taken by surprise, and after
some little confusion we found ourselves all out 
on the street. Here 1912 rushed the lower class 
and were met by a feeble resistance. 12 retired 
to enable 13 to attend to her injuries, but, in a few 
minutes rushed the young uns again. This time
the laddies defended a little better and rallied to a 
return rush, but were met by such a fierce resistance 
that they were completely demoralized and retreated. 
12 again went at them and that was the end. 1913 
was so badly frightened and surprised that their 
leaders could not get them together to give the upper 
class three rahs and a tiger until they had reached 
Forbes street.
Blessings on the little men.
Economice is a study new to this class. Probably 
originated in China, orwas it a typesetters bull?
Have you noticed it lately?
Yes, I think it is growing nicely. Dont you? 
Yes, it is; but I think he ought to cultivate it 
more.
Thats right, too. They say that vataline and 
lamp black improves them greatly. I believe Ill 
tell him about that mixture.
Yes, I would. He would welcome the suggestion. 
He was telling me that one of the neighbors sug
gested the use of a curry comb.
Yes, I know. He was a-king me where he could 
get a second hand one.
Well, here he comes now. Let us tell him about 
the vasaline.
Joe McCreery (who has just arrived).What are 
you fellows talking about now?
Chorus:Your moustache, Joe, your moustache.
Lucas is now attending the day sessions.
You should have seen Mac endeavoring to make 
a smash mit the girl who makes pop-corn balls 
at the Expo, fellows. It was great.
Lonergan entered a very strong protest against 
being called the Beau Brummel of the class, so 
will re-christen him. Surely he will not object to 
being called our poet laureate.
Maisch has improved each busy day of the past 
summer and can now finger the ivories like a real 
artist. Grow the hair for the job, Maisch, and 
1912 will be proud Of her Paderewski.
Skeehan has a position which requires his pres
ence from 7 P. M. to 6 A. M. Hence, his resignation 
from the office of Class Marshall.

6THE TARTAN
M. M. C. S.
The Caf.
At the beginning of this school year, the lunch 
room was opened under the direction of Miss Bradt 
as a means of giving the Senior Household Arts class 
practice in Institutional Management. The girls of 
this class are divided into two sections, these sec
tions alternating between the House and the Caf, 
nine weeks being spent in each.
The girls of the lunch room division must fill in 
turn the positions of manager, cashier, book-keeper, 
chief cook, assistant cook and inspector. The re
sponsibility of these positions was' alarming at first. 
For the manager really has to manage, and the 
cashier finds the handling of real money to be some
what different from the banking done last year.
The manager is in charge of the store room and 
refrigerator, ordering all food supplies, and over
seeing all work done in kitchen and lunch room. 
She also plans the menu for the week, and so, fair 
ladies, is responsible (may be) for what comes your 
way at noon.
The Cashier and Book-keeper are learning the mys
teries of the voucher system, and their troubles 
seem to be numerous. Mr. Wood assumes the as
pect of a life saving station to these bewildered 
maidens when they seem about to be swallowed up 
in the black waters of accounts that will not balance.
In the kitchen, the five cooks grapple with the stu
pendous problem of feeding the multitude of clam
oring students. Their pathway is not always strewn 
with roses, so, dear girls, a wTord of appreciation 
now and then will not be wasted. The period from 
nine to twelve that seemed all too long in our Jun
ior year, now proves all too short for the prepara
tion of dishes measured by gallons and pecks. When 
the soup finally is ready for transportation the ele
vator sternly refuses to be moved from its superior 
position and remains calmly indifferent to our fran
tic entreaties and powerful persuasion. In the rush, 
the cooks find their wits prone to fly to the four 
quarters of the earth, and only the cool, steadying 
hand of Miss Bradt saves them from distraction. 
There is a rumor current among us that a certain 
Chief Cook was compelled by the powers that be 
to consume five pounds of rice as a penalty for mis
calculating a recipe. But we discredit it when we 
remember the motto Miss West gave usLet a 
remnant be saved!
The Chief Cook may well look serious. She must 
not only direct the cooking itself but she must see 
that every dish is in place and every knife properly 
scoured, for lo! the Juniors come into the kitchen 
after us, and behold they criticise the Seniors work! 
These same Juniors are tripping the light fantactic
 toe in the Gym or strolling in the Park while the 
Seniors are wrestling with a pile of dishes mountain 
high, which dishes were soiled in preparing the
wherewithal to feed those hungry Juniors. The 
pathway of the cooks has many a thorn, but also 
its roses. The cooks have hard work to do to be 
sure, but they are having the experience of han
dling large quantities, working out recipes, etc., 
and at the same time learning to work systemat
ically, smoothly, surely, and to depend on them
selves.
Two of the dietary girls each week do counter ser
vice, while the inspector enjoys the privilege of 
walking about seeking what has not. been devoured 
and keeping things generally in order.
When this division has finished its progressive 
game, the House division will come into the caf to 
struggle with the same difficulties we have met and 
subdued. Each division will have a second trial to 
give confidence and certainty, and establish the les
sons learned in the first term.
So far the work has gone very well considering 
the handicap of incomplete equipment and the unre
liability of trades people, butchers, the baker, and 
the chocolate cream maker. None but those con
nected with it, know the difficulties the department 
and the first Senior class has to contend with, or 
commendations would be more numerous. The suc
cess of the venture is due to the cheerful little op
timist who so skillfully pilots us through troubled 
waters and inspires us with admiration and loyalty. 
Then
Heres to her who cheers us,
To her we all adore,
Whose ability is not measured 
By her height above the floor!
Miss Quinn has invented a very ingenious device 
to be used in teaching children the alphabet. It 
/combines the principles of the phonograph and 
steam piano. Patent attorneys, please call at the 
school for further technical information.
Miss BradtMiss Kemple, how would you build 
a barn if you were going to start a dairy?
Miss KempleLarge enough for the cows.
Carrie (in Book-keeping)Aint it funny what a 
difference just a few blots make?
The Students Soliloquy.
To grind, or not to grind: that is the question: 
Whether tis easier for the time to suffer 
The curious questions of outraged instructors,
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
And simply cut and end them?
Miss MacGilvary has been absent several days, 
owing to the severe illness of her father.
Great excitement in history last week ! The Sec
retarais almost got stung! There were three bees 
in the room!

To girls about to marry, one would tender the ad
vice that they study their intended victim at break
fast. If he is feeding like forty, reject him as the 
direct descendant of Circe's herd of swine. If he is 
melancholy, beware of the abrupt curves of his 
temperament. If he be boisterous and facetious, re
member that an empty drum gives the greatest re
verberation, and a chatterbox at 8 A. M. is as tire
some as Chanticleer at 3 oclock in the morning. 
By their breakfasts ye shall know them!

which any student of M. M. C. S. could handle intelligently.
Dr. John A. Brashear addressed the girls of the 
M. M. C. S. last Thursday, after having been 
through the building with Director Hamerschlag. 
He told a number of stories in his own delightful 
way, fastening a lesson in our minds with a hu
morous illustration. Summed up in few words his 
talk was, Learn to think for yourselves, girls; and
try each day to scatter sunbeams about you; be 
thoughtful, cheerful, helpful.
DiscoveredThat creamed codfish by another

magic word in this case!
There is a school for ladies 
Built out in Schenley Park
It has a course in cooking 
And all the household arts;
And if the Pittsburg maidens 
Would only study there,
Their terrors of a mother-in-law 
Would be as empty air.
1911NIGHT.
President Wilharm has appointed the following 
Social Committee:
C. H. McCall, Chairman.
O. L. Pringle,
W. D. Workman,
H. F. Gump,
H. M. Laithe.
The above men are already at work on plans for a 
dance with some of the night girls.
1911's Athletic Committee this year will consist of: 
W. J. Yenny, Chairman-.
J. L. Williams,
A. D. White,
A. E. Abel.
Several 1911 men were spectators of the class 
rush between 1912 and 1913. Their unanimous opin
ion is that disputes of the kind should take place 
outside of the schools, since in the excitement of 
the moment some men lose respect for furnishings 
and other property of the school. As there is some 
doubt as to the victors of the rush, we hope to witness 
a contest on the foot-ball field on Thanksgiving 
morning between the two classes concerned, accord
ing to custom.
This column will, in the future, be well supplied, 
as three reporters will collect and submit news to 
the new class editor. They are Archbold of the 
Civils, Pringle of the Metallurgists, and White of 
the Mechanicals.
The Metallurgists of 1911 wish to thank the Cru
cible Club for their hospitality on Friday evening, 
October 16, 1908.
EVERYBODY OUT.
Everybody out for the student parade before the 
Penn game. The parade will form at the school 
at 2 P. M., Saturday and everybody is earnestly re
quested to fall in line. Bring along the yaller um
brellas left over from the Sesqui.

We are compelled to recognize that fate has been 
more kind to some departments of our institution 
than others. Else why should the girls school 
have a monopoly of the services of Edward Esquerre? But probably theres a reason, for it is 
said that women, particularly, remember things by 
association of ideas, and it may be that they are 
compelled to associate Mr. Esquerre with the fact 
that oxygen was discovered in 1774. However, the 
fact remains that most of those who have been 
under his tutelage do remember this important fact, 
although when mental picture of the gentleman in 
question is summoned it is hard to understand how 
he should be associated with any such combination 
of digits, as no matter where the decimal point be 
placed, they would never be accepted for either his 
height or weight, even if labeled slide rue work.
As we have indicated, Mr. Esquerre belongs to 
the Faculty of the Margaret Morrison School, but 
all the schools claim him for his unbounded enthu
siasm for Tech and particularly her foot-ball team 
stamp him an All schools man. His chief place 
of business is in the laboratory, where Mr. Stevens 
explained why celluloid spoons were called horn, 
but he does not limit himself to any such proscribed 
circle of activity, having taken to himself a roving 
commission as chief exterminator of charley horses 
and sprains that the different foot-ball men acquire 
and general overseer of fraternity and club houses.
In the main Mr. Esquerre has not been a factor 
that tended to ruffle the peaceful current of school 
affairs except in one particular, he is possessed of 
a belief amounting almost to an obsession that he 
could easily show Hittner up as a quarterback and 
has not been inclined to accept peaceably the rule 
that makes members of the Faculty ineligible for 
the foot-ball team. Report has it that he is doing 
the next best in training his son for the position he 
would so dearly love to adorn.
At the sessions of the Knockers Club last winter 
he gave a series of talks on Old age and how to 
avoid it, all this to be done by persistent use of
the lacteal fermentation tablets advocated by Metchnikoff, the talks being interspersed with exhibitions 
of debt collecting by the dip route, or in other words, 
The pocket and how it may be picked.
In the main there can be no complaint on the 
actions of our student body at foot-ball games, but 
there are a few misguided individuals, however, 
who will persist in one or two disagreeable peculiar
ities that do not reflect well either on themselves or 
the rest of the students.
About the most flagrant case so far has been the 
hooting of players put off the field. The fact that 
this was done when we were playing a team that 
makes a specialty of that kind of rooting might mit
igate the offense to some extent, but it certainly 
does not excuse it. This kind of rooting is popular 
when the teams financed by various aspiring poli
ticians meet on some large vacant lot to determine 
who can play the worst foot-ball and to a limited 
extent in some colleges. It is almost entirely ab
sent in any of the so-called big ones, and it is cer
tainly up to us to do all in our power to make it 
unpopular here. Another thing that might well be 
mentioned in the same breath is rooting when the 
other team is penalized. However glad we are of 
any advantage our team may get, let us only root 
for earnest advantage or to cheer and encourage 
our boys. Aside from these failings of which only 
a limited number have been guilty, the rooting has 
been altogether commendable so far. Now it is up 
to us to make it something to be remembered at the 
Pennsylvania and University of Pittsburgh games.
CHICAGO TO HAVE MAGNIFICENT LIBRARY.

NOTICE.
GT SPECS.
The foot-ball game was halfway thru, 
When, from the rooters lips so blue,
A cry issued, which doth ensue,
Gt Specs!
The cause of this was quite unique.
It arose from some spectators pique; 
For Luigie Sprague to them did reek. 
So, gt ell Specs!
Poor Luigie tried the cheers to lead, 
But at this he did not quite succeed.
He must have been quite off his feed, 
To gt ell Specs!
Student tickets for the Penn-Tech Foot-ball game, 
October 31st, are now on sale at the store room. 
The price of these tickets is 50 cents, and only one 
ticket will be sold to each student.
No student tickets will be sold at the grounds for 
this game, and none will be sold from the store room 
after Friday evening, October 30th.
These tickets must be presented at the small gate 
or side entrance on Grant Boulevard, and they en
title the holder to a seat in the stands reserved for 
students on the Bouquet street side of the grounds.
C. C. Leeds, Treasurer.
It sure was wrong to call him thus. 
Before the dames you should not cuss. 
But still the bleachers raised a fuss,

NOTABLES SPEAK.
Tech was agreeably surprised by the notice on 
the bulletin boards announcing that Vice President 
Fairbanks would address the student body. This of 
course meant an excused period or so for everybody. 
The hour announced was 11 by the clock; but it 
came and went in direct proportion with the spirits 
of the crowd waiting to enter the Assembly Hall. 
All but a few had given it up as being one of those 
might have been occurrences, when the final word 
that he would positively appear, arrived.
The crowd was noisy and wanted to be amused. 
Lindy jingled the box while the bunch whistled 
and sang. It was the first time this year that all of 
the day student body had been together, and the 
cheer leaders quick to see the opportunities of such 
an occasion, soon got busy, and had things on the 
run. Several new yells were practiced with vim 
and the old ones run over. With this ia progress, 
the first howl came from those nearest the door. 
James Francis Burke arrived. The three times 
three with a Burke on the end went off in fine style. 
Then came several false alarms from the excitable 
bunch near the door, and at last the Director, closely 
followed by the Vice President of the United States, 
entered. The cheering was great, and was an ex
cellent sample of what can be expected should Tech 
score on Old Penn Saturday.
It has been suspected that many of the more timid, 
expecting an exhibition of pyrotechnics and blood and 
thunder oratory, were provided with cotton to deaden 
the sound. On the platform with the Director and 
his distinguished guest and Mr. Burke, was a keen 
eyed man very few seemed to know. The Director 
arose and lit the Welcome to our City sign, in red 
fire. The silence after the outburst of applause was 
tense; all were waiting for the lightning to strike; 
the cotton was pushed in a little more, and the rest 
of the crowd shifted their weight to the other foot. 
Mr. Fairbanks (pause )expressed himself as (long 
(pause) delighted, (tiresome wait) delighted. All 
the cotton came out, for it was evident at the very 
kick-off it would be no eat-em-alive, bite-their-headsoff speech, the text of which is given elsewhere.
The gentleman from Pennsylvania followed with 
a witty but rather pointed speech (election day will 
soon be here). Mr. Burke has lots of ginger and 
certainly can play to the grand stand, which we be
lieve is one of the necessary qualifications of a suc
cessful politician.
Until Mr. Scott was introduced, it was evident 
hardly any one knew him, and after he was through, 
it was evident that he will be known hereafter and 
well known by everyone. So many heard his manly 
appeal and have been talking about it since, that 
any who did not hear it have at least heard of it. 
It was one of the best the student body has ever 
had the pleasure of listening to.
The conclusion of Dr. James paper on rubber re
clamation will appear in the next issue of The Tar
tan.
APPLIED DESIGN.
The position of Assistant Professor in Architectural 
Design the Department of Architecture held last 
year by Mr. J. P. Alaux, became vacant in September 
through the decision of Mr. Alaux to enter into 
partnership with his father, an architect of long and 
honorable standing in Bordeaux, France. While the 
School will seriously feel the loss of Mr. Alauxs ac
tivity, his old colleagues and students are of course 
very glad to learn of his entrance into this new field 
of work, which is one of great promise and impor
tance.
The position vacated by Mr. Alaux will be filled 
this year by Mr G. F. Ferrand, who has just entered 
upon his work in the Department of Architecture. 
Mr. Ferrand is an accomplished architect whose 
professional activities have covered a period of ten 
or twelve years. His former home was in Toulouse, 
France, where he was born in 1876. He entered the 
Ecole des Beaux Arts at Toulouse in 1894, and com
pleted his course of Architecture there with many 
honors. He entered the Ecole des Beaux Arts in 
Paris in 1898. In this School also he won many 
honors. He was twice competitor for the Chenevard 
Prize and was placed 3d and 2d in these two com
petitions, in which it is an honor to be one of the 
five admitted yearly to the competition. He was 
also placed 2d in the Concourse de Reconnaissance 
des Architectes Americains. He was accorded the 
Mention du Salon in 1905 and was awarded the 
diploma.
Coincident with his activity in the Ecole he was 
engaged as designer in the offices of many French 
architects of internationaal fame, among these being 
MM. Laloux, Tronchet, Masqueray, who is now in 
practice in this country, and who was in charge of 
the architectural office of the St. Louis Exposition, 
and Wielhorski, with whom he was associated in 
practice.
In October, 1906, Mr. Ferrand followed the exam
ple of many other brilliant young French architects, 
who have foreseen a brilliant field for their efforts 
in the enormous architectural activities of this coun
try, and came to New York. Since that time he has 
been occupied by the study of many important archi
tectural problems, principally in the office of R. F. 
Almirall of New York. Among these were the studies 
for the Brooklyn Public Library, for a great plaza 
included in the schemes for civic improvements in 
Brooklyn, and for some large hospital groups.
In January, 1908, Mr. Ferrand married the sister of 
his former associate, Mr. Wielhorski, who has ac
companied him to Pittsburgh.
Mr. Ferrand has entered upon his duties in the 
School with great interest and enthusiasm, and he 
will doubtless prove to be an invaluable addition to 
the forces of the Department of Architecture.

The rich Miss Goldrocks I will Wed.
But when he paid his court to her,
She lisped, but firmly said, No,  Thur.
Alas, said he, then I must die!
His soul went where they say souls Fri.
They found his gloves and coat and hat,
And the coroner then upon them Sat.

another fellow wants some paper, and I can get it 
all at once. What do you want to get? There are 
no erasers out here, Ill have to go back and get 
some. Who gave me this dime? Here comes some

Carnegie last Saturday. The game started at 3:35 
P. M. and lasted one hour and five minutes, with 15 
minutes' 'itermission.

game. The treatment accorded us could not have

It is with pleasure we announce that Manager 
Knapp has secured a game with the University of 
Pittsburgh Freshmen. This game will be a prelimi
nary one to the University of Pittsburgh-Carnegie 
Tech game on election day. We trust that all Plebes 
will turn out to support both their class and 'Varsity 
teams.
On Wednesday of last week the Plebe Class met 
for the purpose of crow'ning President Henderson. 
Before the crowning event some business was 
transacted, namely, the election of a captain and 
manager for the class basket-ball team, the election 
of a permanent representative for the Tartan, and 
the selection of a class pin. The results of the elec
tion are:
Temporary CaptainW. E. Brown.
ManagerChas. Dill.
Class Representative for the TartanF. H. Ralph.
The coronation was opened by a speech from the 
chairman of the committee appointed the last meet
ing. Henderson was given a seat in a chair on the 
desk. The crown was then brought forward on 
a salvo by Lamoree and Brown, accompanied on 
the piano tyy The Wedding March. After swear
ing his allegiance to the class and promising to do 
his best for the interest of the class while in office, 
the president was crowned. It need hardly be said 
that the crown was the cap of the convict suit 
worn by the president at the annual class fight. 
This ceremony will be a permanent feature charac
terizing the 1912 class.
FOUNDBy the Plebes classSomebody who 
could play the piano for our entertainment at class 
meetings. Applause is sufficient salary.
QuestionWhat is the hardest thing in our class?
AnswerTexas Bill Stone.
The class pin committee has done good work. 
One was adopted last Wednesday. They will be 
ready in about a week.
We are glad to hear that Trover will be with us 
again in about a week, as his injury is not so serious 
as it was first thought to be.
Has any section had the horrible sensation of hav
ing the same joke sprung on it the second time by 
that member of the faculty who was thoughtless 
enough to lose his record book?
Does Prof. Hokanson intend that we should use 
those slide rules, or does he just want us to have 
them for mementoes, so to say. 
Great men sometimes overlook small things 
such as overcoats for instance. Ask Dr. Brashear.
How's the banquet coming?
By unanimous vote, the Plebe Class decided to 
pay all expenses which Traver may incui on account 
of injury he received recently.
BRIAR PIPE.
Nicotine God! Wreathed in smoke,
Tascent dreams, from revery woke,
Gleam unbidden amid the rings,
Touching Memorys silvery strings 
Sound a melody, rhyming chimes,
Haunting lay of the olden times.
Happy days that have long gone by,
Leap into life ere the embers die.

ATHLETIC REPRESENTATIVES.
Since the agitation was started a few weeks ago 
to straighten out our affairs athletic, one or two 
classes have responded. It is desired that each 
class (that is, year, not sub-division) in both day 
and night classes of all three mens schools meet, 
and elect one representative to meet and adopt our 
Athletic constitution and decide on our permanent 
attitude on athletic expenditures. The meeting will 
be called as soon as the representatives sre elected.

ITS IN THE AIR.
Armand L. Boulfrois.
Blue and Red, Red and Blue, Blue and Red, why, 
it seems as if all Pittsburg has risen to the occa
sion that old Father Pitt  is about to open his 
book of history and read a chapter on the most 
famous foot-ball game that Pittsburg has ever had 
the good fortune to participate in.
The majority of advertisements in the street cars 
are done in Red and Blue. The theaters in a body 
are using the Red and Blue for their dates and 
posters, to advertise the weeks attractions in stageland. The stores are trimming their windows in 
Red and Blue, and even the daily newspapers are 
printing their news bulletins in Red and Blue.
Dark Blue tailor-made suits, with dark blue merry 
widow hats trimmed in bright red, is The already 
predominating wearing apparel with the fairer sex.
Surely it is one grand tribute to dear Old Penn, 
and well she deserves it.
Always a classy college, she long ago took a Arm 
stand for clean and purely amateur athletics, and 
has stuck to it in the steadfast, honest way for 
which Old Penn is famous.
Great credit is due to the athletic committee and 
to Director Hamerschlag, for their diligence in 
bringing to this city one of the best members of the 
world famous Big Four.
Our fine new grand stand, seating over five thou
sand, was built for the occasion. The choice part 
of which is being reserved for the Penn Alumni, 
and the large army of rooters which the sturdy 
squad expect to bring along with them. They are 
to have the choice of the dressing rooms, and any 
other little courtesies that we can give them.
In addition, as a sort of a tid-bit, through the 
courtesy of Manager Thos. F. Kirk, Jr., of the 
Nixon and Duquesne theaters, a box party has 
been arranged for both teams at the latter theater 
after the game.
Nance ONeill is playing the Duquesne this 
week, and the entire set of first floor boxes wiil be 
turned over to the sturday knights of the gridiron. 
The boxes on one side will be trimmed with Tartan 
plaid and the Red and Blue of Pennsylvania will 
hold sway on the other.
It will be a classy event, boys. The Penn 
Alumni are going to be there inmasse, and every 
Tech man with his heart in the right place will be 
there also, and honor the Plaid.
