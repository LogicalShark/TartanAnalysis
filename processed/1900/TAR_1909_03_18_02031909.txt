THE WAYNESBURG GAME
Last Saturday night the Varsity basket-ball team 
journeyed to Waynesburg, where they met defeat 
only after the hardest kind of a fight. The game 
does not count in the Intercollegiate series, so that 
Tech still has a clean sheet for the championship. 
Tech lost to Waynesburg College not on account 
of better team work or more brilliant individual 
playing, but on account of -the peculiarly adverse 
conditions under which they played. They were 
particularly handicapped by the arrangement of the 
cage. The baskets, on account of the low ceiling, 
were placed in alcoves and allowed of no free shots 
except from a radius of about ten feet. This worked 
to good advantage for the Waynesburg force, as 
they were accustomed to the arrangement.
The game opened up with Tech playing her best. 
Good team work soon gave our quintet the lead 
which they maintained the entire first half. The 
team showed to good advantage in this half and 
clearly demonstrated that they have real ability 
and good spirit, which may develop into champion
ship form.
In the beginning of the second half, Capt. Leety 
was disqualified, and Morrison took his place as 
leader of the team. This disqualification seemed 
to have a decidedly demoralizing effect on the team,
for Leetys headwork before this had kept the team 
working as a whole. The game went against Tech 
after this and continued so until the final whistle 
blew. Wilharm took the place of Leety at guard 
and played brilliantly, but the loss of our captain 
had its bad effect. The final score of the game was 
3728 in favor of Waynesburg.
This game was the first since the team won so 
decisively from Geneva. During the next two weeks 
the real work will begin and between the games 
which come during that time, every effort will be 
made on the part of the coaches to work off the 
rough edges so as to be in the best possible condi
tion for the Intercollegiate games. Line-up:

When a Tech man hears the name of Mike, he 
thinks, pED of the usual rotund and garlic-loving for
eigner, but of Michael J. Scheidlmeir, the coach of 
the Mandolin Club, a man who talks with the aid of 
a mandolin and does his thinking in sharps and flats.
He is a native of the South Side, and has brought the 
Mandolin Club of Carnegie Tech to a perfection sel
dom attained by college clubs. His skill in finding 
the sour places and getting rid of them is of great 
value to the club.
Mr. Scheidlmeir has a record which insures his 
standing in the best musical circles. After studying 
with Prof. Sahner and Prof. T. L. McNemry, he has 
had eleven years of experience as a successful teach
er and player. His solo work is well known, and he 
has been associated with many of the well-known 
musicians using the mandolin.

Among the most important sources of arsenic may 
be mentioned the following: The silver mines of 
Saxony, Germany, those of tin and pyrites of Eng
land, arsenico-pyrites or mispickel of Spain, and 
auriferous mispickel in the Province of Ontario, 
Canada. The United States is said to consume more 
than one-half of the worlds production of metallic 
arsenic, white arsenic (arsenious acid), orpiment, 
and red sulphide of arsenic sulphide of arsenic. 
Spain in 1905 exported 1,750 tons of white arsenic 
to the United States and 246 tons to France. Ger
many produces the largest quantity of metallic ar-. 
senic and arsenious acid. England has fallen far 
behind, although it held the first place in 1902. In 
France there are three mispickel mines: Two in the 
Department of the Aude and one in that of the 
Puy-de-Dome. The production of these three mines 
in 1905 amounted to 3,117 tons.Engineering and

By Walter O. Snelling, Chemist, U. S. Geological 
Survey, Washington, D. C.
In combatting mine-fires the use of carbon dioxide 
as a means of producing an atmosphere in which 
combustion cannot be sustained, has been many 
times suggested and frequently tried, generally with 
a fair degree of success. The carbon dioxide is pro
duced by acting on limestone with dilute sulphuric 
acid, large wooden boxes being used to hold the 
limestone, and arranged in such a manner that one 
box may be cleaned and refilled with blocks of lime
stone while another is being used in generating the 
carbon dioxide. The gas is led by jneans of pipes of 
large diameter to the location of the fire, tight brat
tices having been previously put up as close to the 
fire as possible on every side, so as (to limit the 
space to be filled with the gas to the smallest possi
ble volume. The cost of producing carbon dioxide 
has been, however, a decided draw back to the use 
of this method, and the danger of- producing carbon 
monoxides by the reduction of the carbon dioxide by 
heated carbon, and consequently bringing about an 
explosion, has also tended to prevent the application 
of this method.
' The use of sulphur dioxide in combatting jninefires has not, I believe, been previously suggested or 
tried, and yet the method presents such decided ad
vantages over the use of carbon dioxide that it seems 
proper to suggest the advisability of considering it 
as a cheap, convenient, and safe means of fighting 
stubborn mine fires.
Efficiency.Sulphur dioxide is more efficient than 
carbon dioxide in putting out fire. No combustible 
material can possibly burn in an atmosphere con
taining any considerable quantity of sulphur dioxide. 
Sulphur dioxide is very heavy, being almost twice as 
heavy as carbon dioxide (1 cu. ft. weighing 81 grams, 
while 1 cu. ft. of carbon dioxide weighs 56 grams), 
and this heavier weight of the sulphur dioxide is an 
element which leads to increased efficiency, since 
the readiness with which the air present in the in
terstices of a pile of burning coal will be displaced 
by any inert gas is dependent upon the density of the 
gas. Another important effect of the greater density 
of sulphur dioxide is that its cooling effect upon a 
bed of incandescent coal is greater, volume for vol
ume, than would be the case with a less dense gas.
ug*MDB1None of the dangers incident to the use 
of carbon dioxide are present with sulphur dioxide. 
No explosive lower oxides can be produced by the 
reduction of sulphur dioxide. Still more important, 
the danger always piesent when using carbon diox
ide, of men getting into the gas without knowing 
of its presence, and suffocating, is absent when sul
phur dioxide is used, since its strong odor gives in
stant warning when but a small fraction of 1% of 
the gas is present in the air.

Pittsburg, Pa., January 7th, 1909. 
My Dear Little Niece: 
You remember while I was visiting at your home 
last week that I promised to tell you a story, then 
Aunt Graw came and we forgot all about the story 
for the time, but I shall write one to you and I think 
you will enjoy it just as much. It "s about Aunt 
Grace and myself, so now I know you are interested.
When we were about the age of seven and eight 
respectively we lived in a stately old-fashioned house 
in the country. The attic was immense, and con
tained two spinning wheels, several old trunks, three 
large cedar chests, and boxes galore. My, what 
promising possibilities!
One rainy day we were left to amuse ourselves in 
the attic, as mamma had to drive to a town which 
was several miles distant. We investigated trunks 
and chests thoroughly and dressed in all sorts of oldfashioned clothes. Our greatest delight was in the 
hoop skirts which we wore on the outside of our 
skirts, as they were far too funny to hide. Thus 
?rrayed to our own extreme satisfaction, we decided 
to have a tea party.
There was some candy and considerable water 
brought up from downstairs, several pieces of hard 
wedding cake taken from miscellaneous small boxes 
in the various trunks, some cat-nip which had been 
hung near the chimney to dry, and also the most de
licious looking fruit which grandma had put in the 
window to ripen just a littlethen our tea party was 
ready. Everything was lovely and we were saving 
the fruit for dessert. So, in helping ourselves to the 
last course we both took a good sized bite and in an 
instant we were screaming frantically and running 
downstairs. We were met part way by grandma 
and the maid and hurried on down to the kitchen 
where our mouths were washed out with soap suds, 
and we were given more milk than we could drink.
When mamma came we were sitting on chairs in 
the kitchen, both holding in our mouths as much 
apple butter as we could. Mamma looked very sol
emn, as she knew something dreadful must have 
happened. And it hadwe had been eating red 
peppers.
Good night, Virginia, I shall write to you again 
when I am not so sleepy.
Lovingly your Aunt,
Henrietta,

I cannot wear the old clothes
I wore a few months since;
They are not of the latest shades,
Burnt custard, or such tints.
The waist-lines are not high enough,
The back breadth isnt flat;
I cannot wear the old clothes 
And go with Mrs. Slatte.
I cannot wear the old clothes,
The sleeves are all too short;
My fur coat needs a shawl-shaped stole,
My pillow muff should be a rug,

The Angelus, which are too good to miss. They 
are taken verbatim from the examination papers of 
students:

Gabriel was Evangelines feller. Evangeline was 
always chasing after him. When she got left behind 
on the shores of Arcadie she begun chasing as soon 
as she could. She chased him over mountains and 
valleys, but never got catched up with him. At last 
when she was thin and old, she found him laying in 
a poor house with a fever. She just had a minutes 
time before he died to lie his head on her bosom and 
say, Good-by, Gabriel, I done my best.

This picture was painted by Malay. It contains 
a man and a woman, a pitchfork, wheelbarrow and a 
church steeple. The man and woman are very poor, 
they have been digging potatoes because they need 
them to live on. The potatoes look very small. Just 
at sunset they hear a bell ring, it is the Angelus, it 
means they must pray. So they bow their heads 
and pray for bigger potatoes.

Tomorrow night brings probably the last Hockey 
game of the season and incidentally the playoff of a 
tie that should never have been anything but a vic
tory for us. We certainly have no reason to feel 
proud of our attendance record at the previous games 
as they were about as poorly supported as any events 
ever pulled off under our aspices. It is true we dont 
have entire control of hockey matters as we would 
like to, owing to our being dependent on others for 
our ice, but this year we have been more favorably 
treated than ever before and have also had a topnotch team. And still the majority allow the team 
to go through a season without once seeing a game.
It would seem to us that anything worth having 
is worth supporting. If we do not want hockey take 
it out, not on this year's team, but endeavor to have 
the sport dropped before next season rolls around. 
This season is almost over and we ewe it to ourselves 
to allow nothing to slip along with pratically no sup
port as we have allowed t*he hockey team to do this 
season.
The class of 1912 Night, as we said in iast weeks 
Tartan, is to give a smoker open to the entire school 
on next Thursday evening. The proceeds of this 
smoker are to go to the Athletic treasury so the 
smoker deserves a very generous patronage.
Last year this same class gave a smoker that was 
attended quite generally by the night men and by a 
few day men also. Thore day men who took the 
pains to remain over certainly were well repaid as 
the program was undoubtedly good. This year the 
night men claim that they are going to eclipse last 
years program. Among others the Glee Club is to 
assist. -
Smokers like this give the day men a chance to 
get acquainted with a bunch that are worth meeting, 
and that they never would meet except at an occa
sion like this or in the rooters section at a foot-ball 
game. It is to be hoped that a big turnout will be in 
evidence on the eleventh.

Mr. Pfouts is interested in a project which ought 
to reap for him a great profit, viz: The manufacture 
of Irish oak.

again.
Prof. Follows illustrated fish stories were fully

favor them with others of the same kind.
With such entertaining lectures as Prof. Hornbostels account of his school days at Paris, Prof. Gibbs 
illustrated lecture on the Navy and Prof. Doyle's 
talks on politics, we have a real Star Lecture 
Course.

EllisThat rooster would make a good foot-ball 
player. You should send him to Pitt.
K. S. Walker should be awarded the tin medal of

The United States Geological Survey has been ex
perimenting with the gas producer and gas engine 
for several years, and the tests in the gas producer 
at the Government plant have shown that many 
fuels of such low grade as to be practically valueless 
for siteam-furnace purposes, including slack coal, 
bone coal and lignite, may be economically convert
ed into producer gas and may thus generate sufficient gas power to render them of high commercial 
value. In this way lignite beds underlying from
20,000,000 to 30,000,000 acres of public lands, here
tofore supposed to have little or no commercial value, 
are shown to have a large value for power develop
ment. This is of importance to the West, and makes 
possible a great industrial development there. The 
Geological Survey recently issued a bulletin on the

Mr. Field has heard from Vic. Thurston, and as we 
all like to hear from the Alumni, we print the letter 
below:
January 19, 1909.
Mr. Wm. P. Field,
Sec. Carnegie Technical Schools,
Pittsburgh, Pa.
My Dear Mr. Field:Please accept my thanks for 
the interest you have shown in my attempt to locate 
in Pittsburgh. I appreciate it highly and if I am suc
cessful in this matter I will remember both the Di
rector and yourself as having been the cause of it.
What on earth is the matter with the mechanical 
section of the senior class? I never see them men
tioned in the Tartan. I have a compliment for the 
schools. Mr. Wm. Cole, of the engineering firm of 
Dodge and Day, has a Tech man in his office and he 
says he is the best engineer in the place. That cer
tainly sounds good for Tech.
Well, I have to be on the job at 6 P. M., so will 
quit. Remember me to any of the fellows you may 
see and the Professors.
Yours respectfully,
N&DE2 l,02HDEp1

During the first half of February the School of 
Applied Design of the Carnegie Technical Schools 
will hold in Galleries and of the Carnegie Institute 
an exhibition of Chinese and Japanese embroideries, 
textiles, paintings, photographs and color prints. 
These objects which have been loaned by members 
of the faculty and friends of the school, should be 
of great interest to all who enjoy beautiful works of 
art.
One of the most notable features of the exhibition 
will be a collection of Japanese color prints made 
from wooden blocks, executed mostly between 1,750 
and 1,850. Prints of this kind have commanded the 
universal interest of artists and art lovers and have 
had a very marked influence on modern art since 
the opening of the ports of Japan by Commodore 
Perry. No one can see these prints without feeling 
at once the subtle beauty of their composition and 
the charm of their delicate color. This is especially 
true of the prints of the earlier and better period. 
Even those of the later periodof the School of 
Toyokuni, etc.dealing with theatrical subjects, 
hold in composition and strong in color have an im
mense interest. Indeed, as has been aptly said, 
there are no bad Japanese printsthough some are 
better than others.
The Japanese brocades and embroideries also 
make an immediate appeal to lovers of beautiful 
things. These are mostly temple vestments with 
great interest on account of their ritualistic signifi
cance as well as for their subdued richness and 
beauty which render them the best of models for our 
modern textiles.
The Chinese embroidered and woven coats, and 
the small squares, one for the back and two halves 
for the front of mandarins coats, were made to be 
worn only on special occasions. These, with their 
splendid combinations of the richest colors must 
always remain a wonder to our western eyes.
The beauty of line, the freedom of handling, the 
great effects produced by apparently simple means 
in these paintings and prints, the marvelous color, 
the unerring certainty of design, and the consummate 
workmanship of these textiles must forever call for 
the envy and unreserved admiration of anyone who 
has attempted to work in any branch of decorative 
art.

THE CHEMICAL ENGINEER AND OUR NA
TIONAL FIRE LOSS.
BY WILLIAM M. BOOTH, M.S.
(Continued from last week.)
A destructive fire is a national calamity removing 
an otherwise permanent asset, and should be follow' 
ed by an extensive report regarding the same, detail
ed knowledge of 'which would aid in preventing a 
repetition of the loss. Such a report should include 
the possible or probable cause of the fire, a complete 
record of its spread and extinguishment, with its 
action upon all kinds of building materials, including 
wood, fireproofed wood, cements, tiles, beams, gir
ders and sprinkler systems. The methods used in 
this building to prevent loss of life should also be 
thoroughly investigated, with the results.

Manufacturers of experience invaribly provide two 
sources of water supply. Primarily important in 
connection with the power plant, this becomes also 
essential in providing for fire protection. In cities 
on the coast the salt water supply supplements that 
of the city system, while the artesian well is used 
extensively in conjunction with the river, creek or 
lake water of country districts. Automatic sprink
lers are being installed rapidly in large and small 
manufacturing concerns. If protected from frost in 
cold weather they are always ready and act quickly 
and effectively. The fusible metal of the sprinkler 
rapidly corrodes when exposed to certain fumes com
mon about plating and acid works. My own labora
tory was drenched in this way through the corrosion 
and giving away of one of the sprinkler heads. A 
well supply made constantly available by a pump 
water tower and an efficient sprinkler system is 
one of the best assets a manufacturer can own. If 
the city pressure suddenly lowers through a break in 
the main, the plant is not left helpless, as is often 
the case with a single source of supply. Thermos
tats and electric bells now occupy an important place 
in locating fire, and any considerable plant can be 
equipped in this way cheaply and effectively. While 
the watchman may be an old and trusted employe,
If you wish a subscription to any engineering pub= 
lication it can be gotten through  The 
Tartan at student rates.

he is not necessarily an efficient fire fighter, if 
occasion demands, while automatic sprinklers and 
electric signaling systems are ready at all times if 
properly cared for. Large concerns have apparatus 
and trained men to fight fire. They are usually 
under excellent discipline and many a plant has been 
saved from serious loss by energetic and heroic use 
of local apparatus in the hands of workmen. 
Interest is aroused by prize drills and recognition of 
efficient service. A great advantage possessed by 
workmen in any concern over the city firemen is 
their accurate knowledge of the plant itself; of its 
weak and strong parts. Weekly practice with fire 
apparatus is none too often in extensive woodwork
ing plants or textile mills. Particular attention must 
be paid to the hose, as I have rarely visited a large 
fire where some pieces did not prove inadequate to 
withstand the pressure; the valves must not"stick or 
clog, and the hand apparatus must work without be
ing dangerous. Corroded cans are decidedly so and 
have led to useless accidents and sometimes death.
In concluding this article, it may be said that 
every city and incorporated village should include a 
board made up of its citizens, who, with superin
tendents of mills, should meet at stated periods to 
discuss matters relating to the protection of property 
from fire. Lectures on fire protection should be 
given by practical men and fire-fighting apparatus 
should be discussed. Manufacturers who fire their 
buildings for insurance should be punished to the 
.unit of the law, and men handling inflammable and 
unusual substances should be advised of their danger, 
particularly in connection with the use of naptha. 
Children in school should be taught the principles 
of extinguishing fire and how and what to do when 
such accidents occur. A placard of simple rules for 
use in the kitchens of homes showing how to use 
salt, sand and bicarbonate of soda would certainly 
do no harm and might save homes and lives. The 
suggestion is offered that hand extinguishers of an 
approved manufacture should be found in every 
home. We must transform our building laws both 
in relation to dwelling houses and factory buildings, 
must adopt fireproof floors and walls and must be 
able to obtain cheaply material for fireproofiing wood. 
It may be possible to fight some fires with dry chem
icals that chemists or chemical engineers may be 
able to bring into the market. More than a hundred 
years ago an invention was brought out in England 
for preventing fire through the use of gunpowder set 
in a large can of water. When a fire occurred the 
gunpowder was exploded, throwing the water over 
the room. Many fires were extinguished in this 
way. This subject is so broad that it is readily seen 
that one can simply introduce it in an article of this 
kind. The fireproofing of wood, the use of oxygen 
for men fighting fires, of protective clothing and 
some radical change in preventing large loss from 
the use of-*water, are all needed at once and it is 
hoped that our chemical engineers will co-operate 
with mechanical engineers and architects in bring
ing about the decrease of our loss.

The following interesting items appeared in the 
Pittsburg letter, a regular department of the Case 
Tech:
Jeffreys furnished me with a few pointers several 
days ago, including the announcement of the en
gagement of our worthy President, Mr. HowerI 
should say, Happy Harryto Miss S. Chester, of 
Pittsburg. I had to promise, in return for this in
formation, to make a personal report, as well; yes, I 
have joined the throng of Benedicts, too, so, you see, 
the foregoing is not (to use an expressive slang 
phrase), a case of sour grapes.
During the Pittsburg Sesqui-Centennial celebration, 
Mr. H. S. Hower, 99, accompanied by Mr. Roy Knabenshue on an exhibition balloon ascension. The 
time of flight was 1 hour 15 minutes, during which 
time an interesting chart was obtained, giving rec
ords of altitude, temperature and atmospheric con
ditions. We are all thankful for Happy Harrys safe 
return. Otherwise our ,Mg2DB Ep.2gD0UgD&EpH which 
we now extend (regarding the announcement men
tioned above) to both alike, would not be in good 
order.

At the last try out of the. dancing chorus of the 
White Friars, held last Wednesday night, the fol
lowing men were selected: GirlsBeiler, Smail,
Conwell, Weldon, Mason, Silverman, Nuttal, Flem
ing. BoysChallinor, Bickley, Brown, Becker, 
Johnson, Harrison, Butler, and Ericson. The sing
ing chorus of eight has been narrowed down to about 
a dozen men, nearly all of whom are, of course, from 
the Glee Club. A regular rehearsal will be held 
Wednesday (to-day); consult bulletin board for the 
time and place. It is expected these rehearsals will 
shortly commence in the Pittsburg Orchestra Re
hearsal Room in the Carnegie Institute.
The trial for the cast has been posponed and can 
be looked for in a week or so. The title of the play 
has been changed back to the first one announced,

The coming concert of the Glee and Mandolin Clubs 
will without doubt be the best that has ever been 
given by Tech men. These clubs include more men 
than any team or athletic contest and are, there
fore, a very important feature in student life. The 
work is hard and tedious, but the result is more than 
pleasing. It is expected that every Tech man will 
be seen in the Carnegie Music Hall on the evening 
of February 19.
