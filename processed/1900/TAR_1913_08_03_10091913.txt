Shorty Miller  and ten other 
Penn State playerswon Saturdays 
football game, 49 to 0. The contest, 
which was the first of the season for 
both teams, was played at State Col
lege, Pa. Although outweighed, Car
negie played a plucky game and reld 
the State team well, except for Mil
ler.
The little Blue and White captain 
played like the proverbial eel and, 
whether in striking distance or not, 
would get through his opponents.de
fense for long runs. In scoring five 
touchdowns he ran a total of 205 
yards. On only two of these occasions 
did he use his interference, the other 
times twisting, turning, dodging and 
running with the speed of the wind. 
A spectator watching his performance, 
would be apt to forget that there was 
anyone else on the team. But the 
others used their weight to batter a 
path into Tech territory, when Miller 
could end the struggle.
Carnegie played hard after the first 
few minutes, and at times held the 
big opponents helpless. This was 
true during all of the second quarter, 
when State was kept out of the danger 
zone. State started from the kick-off 
and battered their way through the 
Tech line from the 5 mark to a touch
down in two minutes of play. Berry
man going over. It took six more 
minutes to score the second time, Mil
ler turning the trick with a 23-yard 
run.
Then Tech found its feet and in the 
second quarter held State for short 
gains. When the ball was on Techs 
25-yard line, Welty dropped back ten 
yards to try for a field goal but the 
ball went wide. Following this, Kreider got through for a 27-yard gain, 
which put heart into the Tech players.
In the third period, Tech was hold
ing well when Miller broke away for 
a 56-yard run. Man after man went 
after him, but failed to hold him. A 
few minutes later he repeated for 47 
yards. He scored again in the period 
on a 36-yard dash.
In the fourth quarter, States big 
backs forced their way over the goal 
line from the 30-yard line in two and 
one-half minutes of play, Welty car
rying the ball in the last scrimmage. 
Four minutes later Miller scored the 
last touchdown from the 38-yard jine.

The general lecture hour on Wed
nesday, October 1, was kindly given 
over by Dean Leete to the student 
body, for the purpose of holding a 
mass meeting. William Miller, re
cently elected president of the Senior 
Class of Applied Science, had charge 
of the meeting, and the hour was tak
en up by representatives of the 
schools student activities.
The meeting was opened by prac
tice of a new football song, the words 
of which are set to the old Yale 
Boola, Boola tune.
Football Manager Haaren then 
spoke on the football prospects, and 
upon the election of the second as
sistant football manager from the 
Science School, which was to take 
place at the end of the hour. Tech 
plays six home games, one at State 
College, and one at Geneva College 
this year. The Geneva game will take 
the place of. the heretofore annual W.
& J. game, upon which a special train 
for Tech rooters is taken.
Hollister, manager of the Musical 
Clubs, next spoke of the coming try
outs, and urged every man to come 
out and find out what he could do, 
whether or not he had ever had any 
experience in that "line. The try-outs 
are short and conducted privately, so 
that there need be no embarrassment 
whatever. There is no doubt but that 
the Musical Clubs are the biggest nonathletic organization in the school, and 
contribute greatly to the winter social 
activities; the annual Home Concert 
held in Carnegie Music Hall being 
one of the most prominent affairs of 
the year.
E. C. Clair, alias Skinny, captain 
of the football team, then hid behind 
the piano and made a fiery speech on 
the lack of big men from the Science 
School, saying that it seemed as 
though the little men of the school 
were supporting the team. As Prof. 
Trinks would put it, he saw many big 
men who were conspicuous by their 
absence. His wind seemed to be a 
little poor at first, but that was no 
doubt caused by a previous vigorous 
assault upon the Poor Food Exhibit 
at the Beanery, from which he had 
just come.

The students and other followers of 
the Tech football team will obtain 
their first glimpse of the 1913 eleven 
in action in a regular game on Sat
urday afternoon, at Tech Field, when 
our men line up against Waynesburg. 
Last years contest we won easily by 
the score of 25 to 0, and with a heavier 
and better team, we should be able 
to repeat the performance.
Our line-up for Saturday will be for 
the most part the same as that which 
faced Penn State last week. McCaughey, who was prevented from 
playing in the opening game by work 
at school, will take his place in the 
Waynesburg contest. At the time of 
writing no definite information could 
be obtained, but he will probably be 
found at full back, a position new to 
him, yet one which he gives promise 
of filling as successfully as he did his 
former position at guard. Capt. Clair 
will return to his regular place at left 
guard and will greatly strengthen the 
line.
Represented by one of the heaviest 
elevens in its history, Tech should 
be able to make a good record this 
fall. The remaining games are sched
uled with teams with which we shall 
be evenly matched. Judging from pre
vious years, everyone of them will be 
well worth seeing. The spectators at 
a college contest always play an im
portant part in it. Their cheering en
courages the men on the field and 
makes them fight hard, especially 
when they are losing. It is the duty 
of every loyal Tech rooter, therefore, 
to be in the stands at every game. 
Next Saturday, every seat should be 
occupied. Furthermore, every stu
dent is expected to join in the cheer
ing. The Plebes must not fail to 
learn the school songs and yells. The 
game will be called promptly at 3 
oclock. For those not possessing the 
Athletic Association books, an admis
sion fee of fifty cents will be charged. 
All roads lead to Tech Field on Sat
urday afternoon.
An assessment of $10.00 annually 
will be levied on all future Stanford 
students as an upkeep fund for the 
new gymnasium that is at present be
ing erected by the university. In this 
manner about $11.000.00 will be raised 
annually.Daily Texan.

The outlook for winning cross-coun

hue last week when Capt. Haselton, 
of the first mentioned team, returned 
to school. He appeared at the track 
meeting Friday afternoon ready to

Similar practices have been and will 
be held every afternoon, the men leav

chances for first year candidates to 
make the team are exceptionally good 
inasmuch as only one Varsity distance 
runner is in school. All runners, how
ever, no matter what their distance, 
should take part in these early work

themselves in condition for the more

IoRTERvb
Commencing with this issue, a 
competition is opened for men to fill 
positions as reporters on this paper. 
Several men will be chosen. The com
petition is open to all students in the 
schools, and will run until after 
Thanksgiving.
There is probably no better way 
to become acquainted with the various 
lines of student endeavor in a uni
versity, than to become connected 
with its publications. Here is afford
ed a wider vision of all the activities 
than can be gained by participation 
in any other one of them; there is 
acquired a knowledge of what the 
students are accomplishing for the 
school, and what the school is doing 
for them. Then, too, there is the 
opportunity to become better ac
quainted with the members of the 
Faculty; to learn their maturer views 
on subjects, which to the student with 
his limited knowledge, are impossible 
of full comprehension; and to realize 
what an interest the Faculty takes in 
the development of the students 
minds and characters.
In this connection there are no re
quirements as to previous experience 
and training. The ability to write 
good English, and the aptitude of the 
candidate for securing interesting 
school news will be the determining 
points. Hence no man should hesi
tate because of lack of previous ex
perience. Of course, such is a valu
able aid, but men who go to the staff 
of The Tartan as reporters will soon 
acquire this training. Contributions 
should be left in the boxes of The 
Tartan in the various schools, and the 
contributor is requested to sign his 
name and class-number to each ar
ticle that he turns in. Decision will
be made on the number of articles 
received, and the quality of the ma
terial in such articles.
hTTENTIoN oF 
NIGHT vTUDENTv
The attention of the students in 
the night courses is hereby called to 
the notice announcing a competition 
for reporters, which notice appears 
elsewhere on this page. Heretofore 
the staff of The Tartan has been com
posed of representatives from' the 
four different schools and their alum
ni, but these representatives have al
ways been day-students. As a result 
of this, we believe that a great deal 
of interesting news in regard to what 
happens in the night classes has been 
overlooked; not because it was not 
considered as fully important as news 
from the day men, but because it was 
very difficult, in some caSco almost 
impossible, to get in touch with the 
night men from whom such news 
might have been obtained.
In order to remedy this difficulty, 
we wish to have one or more repre
sentatives from the night schools on 
the staff of The Tartan, so that their 
events may be given the same pub
licity as is afforded those of the day 
students. It is therefore hoped that 
sonre night students will be sufficient
ly interested to come out in this com
petition, and endeavor to secure a 
position on the staff.
CLhvv ELECTIoNvb
In one of the latter issues of last 
year The Tartan caded attention to a 
method of class elections which had 
been adopted with great success in 
one of the large universities of this 
country. We are glad to note that 
the recent election in the Science Sen
ior class was conducted along some
what similar lines. Their procedure 
was as follows:
All nominations were made by bal
lot, and six men receiving the high
est number of votes being nominated 
for the office of President. Balloting 
was again resumed, and the man re
ceiving the highest number of votes 
cast was declared the elected Presi
dent, wrhile the one receiving the sec
ond highest number of votes became 
the Vice President.
This is certainly a very good way 
to elect all class officers. It avoids 
the questionable practice of nominat
ing by voice two or three men, popu
lar or not as the case may be, and 
by an exaggerated laudatory nomina
tion speech temporarily influencing 
the opinions of the members of the 
class, often against their better judg
ment. Domination by fraternities and 
all their kindred evils are thus avoid
ed. The man who is nominated and 
finally elected by his class assumes 
office with the knowledge that he is 
really the choice of a majority of his 
fellow-classmates, and that he is per
sonally responsible to them for his 
actions and for the manner in which 
he conducts the duties of his office.
vCHooL vIIRITb
Once a year, or oftener, we are 
compelled to put before our readers 
an exposition of our views on school 
spirit. It is one of the misfortunes 
of this group of schools that its con
ditions and environment are such as 
to place a premium upon the love for 
Alma Mater evidenced in active 
support of its traditions and institu
tions. The leaders in various activi
ties invariably revert to appeals to 
show some school spirit. The ma
jority of the Faculty, in a more subtle 
way, appeal to the same pride in sur
roundings; even the Sophomores, in 
their posters placed for the benefit of 
the Plebes, put forth a commandment 
that the new student swear to show 
school spirit. So often are these ap
peals made, and so numerous are the 
mentions of the need for it written in 
The Tartan, that this intangible neces
sity is at times almost a joke to the 
thoughtless.
Because of innumerable things asked 
in its name, one may well ask, What 
is this school spirit? Why are so 
many activities demanding this un
known quantity? And the questions 
are common, not only among the 
Plebes, but alas! among the upper
classmen as well.
Some recreations must be provided 
in a college world for reaction from 
the routine work. These, of necessity, 
take a varied form. Athletic, musical, 
literary and social organizations are 
provided for the intelligent direction 
of the different inclinations. Those 
which have received the approval of 
the students and of the Faculty of 
the Carnegie Institute of Technology 
in the past survive under the super
vision of Student Activities Commit
tee. Every student is given an op
portunity to take part in one or more 
of these activities.
Now, this is where the School 
Spirit comes in. in order to per
petuate these organizations, which are 
as much a part of C. I. T. as the class
rooms and the studies, students must 
give support. If you can participate, 
do so. If nof, give some time or some 
money, or both (not much is ever 
demanded), to show your acceptance 
of the institutions. The approval of 
your presence at every public per
formance of any of these organiza
tions is a guarantee to the world that 
these are the genuine Carnegie Tech 
teams and clubs.
Then there is a negative require
ment. Refrain from doing or from 
supportnig those things which may do 
damage to the good name of the 
schools. An example: never indulge 
in hisses or cat-calls directed at a 
member of an opposing team.
Which brings us to the special pur
pose of this sermon, the text, so to 
speak. On next Saturday the Car
negie Tech football team plays its 
first game on the home field. The 
team is the representatives of the In
stitute in the sport; the game is one 
to excite every drop of red blood in 
your veins if you are an average 
American; the cost to you is but a 
few hours in the open, a few efforts

Despite agitation and legislation 
this country makes little progress in 
abandoning its discreditable back
wardness in saving human life at rail
way crossings. Advances have been 
and are being made, but very slowly. 
This is partly because of the reluc
tance of railways to spend the enor
mous sum's required to do away with 
grade crossings out and out, partly 
because public agitation is sporadic, 
and not persistent enough. The best 
policy of good railways is, even from 
the point of view of cost and con
venience, in favor of doing away with 
grade crossings; they entail danger, 
delay, and damage suits. But many 
railway men insist that State and town 
should join in the cost, and it is often 
difficult to get a fair basis of action. 
Meanwhile, even in New York City 
itself, the condition is astonishingly 
bad. Mr. McCall, of the New York 
Public Service Commission, has late
ly issued a statement which includes 
an appeal for an appropriation of $1,-
100,000 by New York State to aid in 
abolishing grade crossings in New 
York City. The Scientific American 
summarizes as follows: The appeal
of the Commission is accompanied by 
an illuminating report upon present 
conditions, in which it is stated that 
on the Long Island Railroad system 
alone there are 697 crossings at grade, 
of which less than half, we learn to 
our astonishment, are protected by 
gates, flagmen, or even alarm bells. 
In Greater New York alone there are 
477 grade crossings which are desig
nated as dangerous. It is noted that 
in Brooklyn between Norwood ave
nue and Jamaica there are from 210 
to 332 train movements daily over the 
crossings at each street, and that at 
one of these an average of 423 school 
children cross the tracks four times 
each day. Again, an investigation of 
Railroad avenue in Brooklyn showed 
that in an hour and a half 453 persons 
went over a crossing, over which 11 
local trains and 25 express trains 
passed during the same period. In 
the four years, 1908 to 1912, 100 per
sons were killed at crossings within 
the limits of New York, and 150 were 
injured.Outlook.

Trotol is the name given to a new 
explosive for which it is claimed that 
it is the safest high explosive known. 
Its formula was worked out by Lieu
tenant Harold C. Woodward, an of
ficer in the New York National Guard. 
He proposes, as reported, to present 
his discovery without reward to the 
United States Government. The fol
lowing account of Lieutenant Wood
wards invention is from the columns 
of the New York Sun:
Three years ago a brother (of Lieu
tenant Woodward) came across an old 
volume that had been presented to 
German officials at the time of the 
Franco-Prussian War. In the book 
were 2,000 formulas for high explos
ives, mainly anonymous. The Ger
mans had simply shelved the book, 
perhaps discouraged by the number 
of recipes and the impossibility of 
testing them all.
Woodward tried five formulas at 
random, and found them all either 
worthless or inferior to explosives 
now in use. He tried a sixth at ran
dom and found it extraordinary safe 
and good but rather weak as com
pared with the best dynamite. But 
from it he developed trotol.
Trotol can be exploded only by ful
minate of mercury, the substance 
used to explode dynamite. It cannot 
be set off by any shock, however 
great. In a test at Fort Wadsworth 
trotol was packed into a twelve-inch 
shell and the shell was fired at armor 
plate 1,000 yards away. The shell 
struck the armor plate while going at 
a rate of 2,750 feet a second, but the 
trotol inside remained unexploded in 
spite of the terrific concussion.
Six ounces of trotol, it is said, will 
do the work of twelve ounces of dyna
mite. Dynamite deteriorates in water 
or on the water and under certain at
mospheric conditions. Trotol can be 
soaked in water for years and be as 
good as ever. It looks like wet brown 
sugar and is made up in sticks like 
dynamite. Trotol can be carried wet 
or dry, and the fulminate of mercury, 
which must be kept yards away from 
dynamite lest a premature explosion 
result, may come as close as six inch
es to trotol without danger. Like dy
namite, trotol cannot be exploded by 
ignition.The Outlook.

The New York, New Haven, and 
Hartford Railroad has decided to 
equip all of its locomotives with the 
superheater device. The locomotives 
will be overhauled at the rate Of five 
a month. The work all told will cost 
in the neighborhood of $1,000,000. The 
use of superheated steam in locomo
tives is a development practically of 
the last few years. Superheated steam 
is steam having extra heat, part of 
which may be lost without causing 
condensation. While it long ago was 
recognized that the use of superheated 
steam would mean a great saving in 
the cost of maintenance of locomo
tives, it is only within a few years 
that the mechanism has been so per
fected that it could be called commer
cially successful. The fifty new Paci
fic type locomotives just acquired by 
the New Haven and known as the
1,300 series are all superheaters. About 
350 locomotives in all will be equipped 
with this device. The large outlay 
required by this work is justified by 
the fact that while the hauling capa
city of a locomotive is increased about 
20 per cent, there is at the same time 
a saving effected of 20 per cent in coal 
and 25 per cent in water.The Out

Continued from Page 1 
Tech managed to hold the score until 
the game ended.
Carnegie players were not given 
much chance to distinguish themselves 
individually except by pluck. Trautman made several good tackles that 
slowed up the State play, but Tyler, 
Lauer and Fulmer were also playing 
hard. Kreider made the most sub
stantial gain for the team in carrying 
the ball. Clairs kicking was a fea
ture, his punts being long and well 
placed. Kesner ran the team well, 
but did not have the ball often enough 
to show to advantage.
As expected, the value of the State 
game lies in the lessons which it 
taught the team. A squad that can 
face the defeat of last Saturday and 
come through fighting till the last 
second should have little trouble win
ning the comparatively easy games re
maining on the schedule.
The game in detail follows:
Clair kicked off at 3:08 to Tobin, 
who returned the ball three yards from 
his 15-yard line, Trautman making the 
tackle. Berryman carried the pig-skin 
around Techs right end to the 50-yard 
mark. On a series of short runs and 
plunges, State carried the ball to the
20-yard line and Berryman ran 
around Techs right end for the first 
touchdown after two minutes of play. 
Welty kicked goal, making the scofe
7-0.
H. Clark kicked off to Fulmer who 
returned 10 yards to the middle of the 
field and dropped the ball after being 
tackled hard. Welty recovered the 
ball on our 45 mark. State was penal
ized 15 yards for holding. Lauer 
tackled Miller for a 5-yard loss, and 
Clark, failing to make the distance 
on two tries, punted to Kesner 14 
yards from' Techs goal. Clairs re
turn punt went 40 yards, Miller catch
ing and returning the ball to Techs 
35-yard line before Trautman downed 
him. Tobin carried the leather out 
of bounds on the 25 mark, then Miller 
took the ball around left end for the 
distance and made the second touch
down. Welty again kicked goal. 
Score: 14-0.
H. Clark kicked off to Clair, who 
returned 15 yards to the 30 line. Clair 
gained 5 more yards before the first 
quarter ended.
vrlC,d qftn.rn
Kesner failed to gain at end, then 
attempted a forward pass. Clark in
terrupted the ball and was stopped on 
Techs 25-yard line. Carnegies line 
then started a whirlwind session and 
threw Tobin and Lamb for losses. 
Welty recovered 4 of the 5 yards lost, 
and Clark attempted a field goal from 
the 35-yard line, but failed.
Clair gained 6 yards through tackle, 
then Kreider made a pretty gain of
19 yards through the hole in States 
line. Balsinger and Kesner were held 
for no gain, and State was penalized 
for off-side on an attempted forward 
pass by Kesner. Clair, Kesner and 
Balsinger gained 5 yards in three 
downs, then Clair punted to Tobin, 
who took the ball out of bounds on
State s 15-yard line. Clark gained 21 
yards on a fake kick, then States 
backs, in 5-yard gains, carried the ball 
to Techs 40-yard line. Tobin gained
10 yards more before the second quar
ter ended. No score for the period. 
Third Quarter
At the beginning of the second half. 
State made the following substitu
tions: Weston for Berryman; Berry
man for Tobin; H. Miller for Vogt. 
Clair kicked off to Berryman, who was 
downed after a five-yard return on 
State s 35 line. Clair gained 20 yards, 
but State lost 15 of these for holding. 
Clark gained 5 more, and after Berry
man had gone out of bounds with no 
gain, Shorty Miller made another 
of his sensational runs and covered the 
65 yards to the goal line. Welty 
again kicked goal, making the score
21-0.
Clair kicked off to Weston, who 
went out of bounds on States 20-yard 
line. Berryman took the ball into 
Carnegies territory with a 32-yard 
gain. Shoop was sent in for Weston, 
and Trautman went out with an in
jured ankle, Priestly taking his place.

three, then Miller, with a wonderful 
60-yard run, broke through the Tech 
defense for another touchdown. Welty 
kicked the goal from placement. 
Score, 28 to 0.
McVean replaced Lamb and re
turned Clairs kick-off 6 yards to the 
25 line. Clark punted to Techs 30- 
yard mark, then State drew a five-yard 
penalty for off-side. Clair punted but 
the kick was blocked before it was 
fairly away and State recovered the 
ball on our 30-yard line, from where 
Miller ran for another touchdown. 
Welty did the usual thing and kicked 
goal. Score: 35 to 0.
Clairs kick-off went to Miller on 
State s 25-yard line, but he returned 
it to 47 yards from Techs goal. Bar
ron went in for H. Clark and was giv
en the ball. Welch broke through and 
got him for a 3-yard loss. Barron, on

failed and the whistle ended the per
iod.

from where Welty went over. Welty

ell. Welty kicked off to Clair, who 
was stopped after a 15-yard gain on 
the 30 line. Clair failed to gain, but

PEABODY DEFEATS SOUTH 
HIGH, 40-6.
Before a large and enthusiastic 
bunch of their rooters, Peabodys 
heavier eleven defeated South High 
to the score of 40-6 on Tech Field 
Saturday.
South High played the end run and 
forward pass frequently, but were 
rarely able to make a large gain. Pea
body, resorting to straight football, 
hit South Highs lighter line for a 
good gain nearly every formation. The 
game was refereed by Mr. McCul
lough.

The changes in the rules for the 
season of 1913 are for the most part 
not of vital importance as affecting 
the play.
The first alteration was brought 
about by the fact that the player 
could not be returned to the game 
after he had once been taken out, 
except at the beginning of a period. 
It often happened that an unexpected 
substitution was necessary in the 
fourth period, and there seemed to be 
no reason why an exception should 
not be made in this case, but the rules 
forbade it, hence they were altered 
this year to read: A player may be 
returned once at the beginning of any 
period, or at any time during the 
fourth or last period.
A relic of the old time, when the 
ball was not always snapped back 
with the hands, has been in the rules 
for years, but this has been eliminated. 
The rule which read by one quick 
continuous motion of the hands or 
of the foot has been shortened by 
cutting out the words or of the foot.
The rule relating to a forward pass 
or a kick made from behind the goalline has been made clearer.
The rule relating to dropping back 
linemen has also been rendered clear
er by changes in the wording, the 
spirit remaining the same.
A specific penalty has been placed 
upon advancing beyond the lines in 
case of a punt-out, the penalty now 
being that the punters angle being 
moved five yards away from the 
nearest goal-post along the goal-line.
If the punter out makes a deliber
ate attempt by a feint to draw the 
opopnents off-side, the referee is not 
to permit him to kick the ball until 
the opponents have had time to return 
behind their restraining line.
In the rules regarding the conduct 
of players after a forwrard pass or after 
a kick, insertion of the words after 
the pass has been made now makes 
it clear that players may interfere with 
one another until the pass is actually' 
made.
The rule regarding kicking has 
also been changed so that the kick
er need not of necessity stand five 
yards back of the line when he makes 
a kick. He may be as near the line 
as he pleases. This will probably 
bring back some of the old quick kicks 
from formation.
This last is probably the most im
portant change effected.Brown and 
White.
EXIEL vTUDENTv WHo 
oyJECT To DRINKINGb
The expulsion on account of their 
total abstinence principles, of a num
ber of students from Griefswald Uni
versity, one of the oldest in Germany, 
has caused a sensation there.
The students, numbering about 1,- 
000, were called together to attend a 
typical beer evening in celebration
of the jubilee of the Emperor Wil
liams reign. The rector of the uni
versity presided. Several abstainers 
protested and were thereupon repri
manded by the officials, who declared 
their protest an incitement to action 
against academic customs.
One of the abstainers criticised the 
reprimand and was sentenced by the 
authorities to three days confinement 
in the university dungeon. Further 
protests by other students led to even 
more drastic steps being taken by the 
authorities, who at once expelled two 
of them and summoned four others 
for trial before the university officials.

Last Thursday while excavating for 
the Head House of the Industries 
Building, the walls of a ditch caved 
in crushing one man to death. Be
cause of the recent rains the walls 
of the ditch were very loose, and a 
man wheeling a wheelbarrow along 
the edge started the cavein. Mike 
McLight, the man who met his death 
in such a horrible manner, was at 
work in the ditch. When the wall 
caved in it buried him1 underneath. 
Frantic efforts were made to dig him 
out, but he was dead when rescued. 
Death in all probability was instan
taneous, as his head was crushed in 
and it was evident that he had been 
injured internally. The dead man had 
been in the employ of the Sauers Con
tracting Company foi eight years, and 
was a valued employe. The deceased 
leaves a wife and two children.
A last years freshman adorned 
with a monocle is to the average col
lege man as the proverbial red flag 
to the bull.Red & Black.

While on his way to school last 
Friday morning, R. A. Willson, of 
the Design School, met with an acci
dent that was very painful. He was 
running down Shady avenue to catch 
his car, when he slipped on a piece 
of fruit and fell. In falling he hit 
his face against the curbstone and was 
knocked unconscious for two hours. 
He is back to school this week, but 
his face is still in very bad shapeWe might recall the old saying, 
Haste mars face.

At the Monday assembly, Septem
ber 29th, Director Hamerschlag ad
dressed the students on the History 
of the Margaret Morrison School and 
of its wonderful progress, with the 
hope that the present student body 
would not only try to uphold the 
present standard but to raise that 
standard if possible.
The main part of the Directors 
talk, however, was directed to the 
Feministic point of view. He said 
that almost every girls has many great 
and important choice to make for her
self and that each one helped the 
girl to make the next important step. 
The first is the choice of college or 
university which the girl will attend. 
Second is the occupation which will 
be guided by the course of study she 
has pursued at college. The third 
decision in the Directors mind is the 
choosing of a husband. He hoped 
that the girls who were attending M. 
M. C. S. would never regret having 
chosen this school, and that having 
attended this school they would be 
helped in making the other two 
choices.

Holzworth, as chairman of the Club 
Room Committee, then spoke of the 
abuse of furniture in the cluu room, 
and announced that a fund of about 
$150, derived from an excess of tutor
ing fees, was to be used to help keep 
it in good shape. Those who have 
tutored can now feel that they have 
done something for the club room. 
A representative is yet to be elected 
from the Plebe class.
Miller then spoke of the cross
country team, the candidates for which 
will be called out soon, and of the 
general track work.
The meeting was brought to a close 
by singing the Amici, everybody 
standing. To much credit cannot be 
given Mr. MacDowell for his able 
leadership of the singing and the spirit 
which it put into the meeting.
The cheering throughout the meet
ing was led by Savago. This is the 
first opportunity the students of the 
Science School have had to practice, 
and we hope that the Plebes will save 
the sheets on which they are printed, 
and learn them as soon as possible. 
Organized cheering does a great deal 
towards helping the teams and mak
ing games interesting.
A few comments are no doubt time
ly on one condition of our school life 
which is very noticeable. As the stu
dents no doubt noticed, each one .No 
the speakers repeatedly urged the men 
to come out and trv for the different 
activities. If this has no special sig
nificance to the students, it should 
have, because right there seems to be 
the trouble with the student body. 
There is never any complaint that the 
material isnt there, but there is that 
it wont come out. The trouble seems 
to be that most students leave every
thing to somebody else, either through 
indifference, or because he has men
tally determined that he hasnt the 
necessary qualifications. In other 
words, what is everybodys business 
is nobodys business. If the students, 
especially the Plebes, will just take 
that to heart, and will go out for that 
which they are most likely to be fitted 
for, there will never be any lack of 
material out of which men can be 
picked for the finest organization that 
have ever represented the schools.
PHo CLUy PEETINGb
There will be a meeting of the Mho 
Club at 8:15 P. M. Wednesday even
ing, October 15th, in Room 106, Ma
chinery Hall. A business session and 
election of officers will be held and 
it is therefore important that all mem
bers be present. All Sophomore 
Electricals are cordially invited and 
urged to be present at this meeting.
The death of Leonard E. Mason, of 
the Design School, came as a great 
shock to his numerous friends. He 
was drowned near Portland, Me., dur
ing the vacation and it was not until 
school opened that his untimely end 
was learned of.

W'e have classified our advertisers so that our readers may use the list 
for reference before making purchases. The grouping furnishes an excellent 
variety of merchants for any article which a student, alumnus or faculty 
member would be likely to buy, and there is no valid reason of which we are 
aware that would justify anyone interested in the welfare of The Tartan in 
making purchases from any but merchants who so kindly make such a publi
cation possible. Be sure, also, to give one of the purchase stubs, which you 
will find enclosed in your Tartan every other week, to the clerk from whom 
jcu make the purchase. The stubs, we have found, make pleased advertisers 
and help to get new ones. May we depend upon YOU to take this as a re
sponsibility to your Institution and to The Tartan.
oUTLooK yRIGHT FoR PUvIC
hL CLUyb
On last Sunday afternoon the first 
rehearsal of the musical clubs showed 
an attendance which went far to. 
eclipse the initial rehearsals of pre
vious years. Over seventy-five men, 
old and new, were present and both 
Mr. McDowell and Mr. Scalzo started 
the men on the new music.
The prospects for the new year were 
discussed by Manager Hollister and 
President Madison, in the Glee and 
Mandolin Clubs, respectively, These 
men outlined, to the candidates par
ticularly, what was expected of them. 
They showed the advantage to be 
gained while in connection with the 
clubs; the fellowship of the student, 
good times, etc., on trips and most of 
all an education along musical lines 
under able instructors that could not 
be gotten elsewhere.
Now that the prospects for the new 
year are the brightest we have ever 
had, the management would like to 
assure the candidates that promptness 
and regularity at rehearsals will go 
farther toward securing positions in 
the clubs than extraordinary ability. 
With this arrangement, the club urges 
all men who have any - ability at all 
along vocal or instrumental lines to 
come out and try for the clubs. A 
man never knows how good he can 
sing or how well he can play until he 
performs before the instructors; then 
he is told in a pleasant way whether 
or not he is fitting. Too many men 
hold off from this initial try-out be
cause they are too bashful to allow 
their voices to come out.
If you have a voice above a whisper 
or any ability with a stringed instru
ment, come to the rehearsals at 2 P. 
M. Sunday, Room 104 Industrial 
Building.
NEW voNGb
Below is given the new song which 
was practiced at the Wednesday Mass 
meeting. The tune is the familiar 
Yale *Boola Boola song:
Well, here we are, well, here we are, 
Just watch us rolling up a score. 
Well leave those ginks so far behind 
They won't try to play us any more. 
For weve the men to play the game 
Well win, now you shall see,
With a hip hurrah, and a hip hurrah 
For dear old Carnegie.
Chorus:
Go, Carnegie! go, Carnegie!
Go, Carnegie! go, Carnegie!
While our Plaid is proudly streaming 
Go, Carnegie! Carnegie, go!
Mr. MacDowell wishes that any 
men having new songs wrould hand 
them' to Madison or himself.
