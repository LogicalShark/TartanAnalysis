TAKE'CHARBEfOF.PAPER
Paquin and Emerich Head 
Editorial Staff With Titus 
arid Todd in Charge of 
Business
 Neoc.t; years Tartan staff will be 
headed by L. K. Paquim as Editor-inChief and H. R. Titus as Business 
Manager. Paquin has been assistant 
managing editor and then managing 
-editor during all but a few weeks of 
the present year, and has been in 
full charge of the paper for the last 
few issues. Titus has been business 
manager during the past semester. 
Both men will next year be spending 
their third year at Tech. In case 
Paquin does not return, which seems 
quite possible at present, his place 
will be taken by L. E. Emerich.
. The ranking .members of the staff 
are as follows: EditorialEditor-inChief, L. K. Paquin; Managing Edit
ors, L. E. Emerich and O. R. Olmstead; 
Assistant Managing Editor, F. I.Smith; 
Business  Business Manager, H. R. 
Titus; Advertising Manager, C. H. 
Todd. In case a man on either side 
of the staff does not -return the man 
next in order will take his place. The 
other members of the staff will remain 
for this year as they are announced 
in the mast head of this issue; any 
changes which may be necessary next 
year will be made then by the new 
'heads of the staff.
There is a wonderful opportunity 
at present for underclassmen to try 
for the taff, for advancement comes 
all too rapidly under present condi
tions. The difficulties of maintaining 
:a staff this year are proof of that. At 
the beginning of the year Bauer was 
managing editor with Paquin as his 
-assistant. Bauer left school, and 
Paquin was advanced with Emerich 
as assistant. Both of these men left 
at about the same time, and the man
aging editors position was left vacant 
for several issues, but Levin and F. I. 
Smith were made assistant managing 
editors. Paquin was able to return 
to school, and assumed his former 
position. Levin had~ to give up his 
Tartan work, and his place was taken 
by Olmsted.  Emerich was able to 
take up a share of the work again, al'though he will not return to school 
until next year. These four men 
Paquin, Emericli, Olmsted and Smith 
have been doing the editorial work 
of the pap.er for the past several is
sues, and were in entire charge of the 
special number last week.
0. T. C. EXAMINATIONS 
HELD DURING WEEK
. Short intensive courses in map-read
ing and in musketry has been given to 
the students in the special 0. T. C. 
class during the last two weeks, and 
examinations are being held in these 
subjects. Although the twenty who 
will go in Class C have been practical
ly decided upon, the grades made in 
these examinations will be taken into 
account, also.
i .The ground covered in the short 
time available has been quits exten
sive, and the men who have taken the 
courses should be well advanced in 
the specified subjects..
M. M.C. S. INSTRUCTOR IN 
GOVERNMENT SERVICE
Carnegie Tech gave another instruc
tor to Uncle' Sam, when Miss Hanna, 
head of the Household Economics De
partment of M. M. C. iS. left for New 
York last night. She will there await 
instructions from Washington in re
gard to joining the Canteen Service, 
probably in France. When Dean Breed 
of M. M. C. S. yas interviewed, she 
said that Miss Hanna had long been 
desirous of entering this branch of 
service, for which she is so peculiarly 
fitv' Miss' Helen Pope will succeed 
Miss Hahna as head of the Household 
Economics Department.
Dean Breed also said that she 
would soon make several announce
ments Regarding changes in the fac
ulty, due to the war.
SCHOOL TO PARADE WHEN 
C CLASS MEN LEAVE
The twenty men who have been 
chosen in the C class for the next 
officers training camp will leave the 
first part of next week, and the mili
tary authorities at Tech intend to 
have an escort consisting of the entire 
institute on parade in their honor, to 
send them away in proper style. The 
idea is a good one and will show the 
men in a concrete way that Tech is 
behind them and is wishing them the 
best of success.
HIRAM DEFEATS TECH. 
IN MONOTONOUS GAME
Hiram College defeated the Tech 
Varsity baseball team Saturday, at 
I-Iiram, 3 to 1. Gretzler was wild in 
the first inning and passed the first 
three men up and this, coupled with 
an error, allowed three runs to slide 
across the pan. Tech was never able 
to overcome this lead.
Excepting the first inning, Gretzler 
pitched fine baseball, striking out fif
teen opponents and allowing but four 
hits in all. The entire team showed 
improved form, but were at a disad
vantage on account of the Ohio at
mosphere impairing the vision of the 
umpire on several occasions.
The game was rather monotonous, 
neither team showing well at bat. 
However, everything considered, the 
performance of the Tech squad was 
satisfactory.

TRACK TEAM WINS CLOSE 
MEET FROM DENNISON
Contest Undecided Until Last 
Few Moments of Meet
The Tech Varsity Track Team de
feated, the team representing Delinison University 'Saturday morning, 
at Granville, O.. by the score of 59% 
by 57%. The meet was closely fought 
throughout, Dennison leading'until the 
final event, the relay. In this Tech 
showed the old lighting spirit and 
Schmidt came from behind on the 
home stretch to win the race aud the 
meet.
The results of the meet show that 
we have a fairly well-balanced team 
and that the entire team deserves no 
little credit for their victory over the 
fast Ohio outfit. Schmidt was the star 
of the meet, taking first in the 440- 
yard dash and the half-mile, besides 
being a great factor in the results of 
the relay. The record of the men 
placing in the meet, however, show 
where the principal 'credit is due.
Jn the early part of the meet Den
nison got a seven-point lead and main
tained this lead up until the last two 
events. The result of the meet lay in 
the hands of the relay men. Lingen
felser, as scratch man for Tech, by a 
splendid exhibition, established a 
four-yard lead. Hunter and Russell 
held their own. Foight, for Dennison, 
and Schmidt, for Tech, were the finish 
men. Foight, by a spurt, overcame the 
four-yard lead and passed Schmidt. 
But 'Schmidt, by steady, hard plugging, 
forged ahead and went across a yard 
in the lead. Summaries:

0. T. C. CLASS SHOOTS 
ON NEW BIFLE RANGE
A miniature rifle range has been 
constructed on the athletic field, and 
special classes in rifle practice held 
for men in the O. T. C. class this week. 
Although comparatively few have had 
an opportunity to try their skill, some 
very good scores have been made by 
those who have been out. Several 
have a record of forty points , out of 
a possible fifty, which is considered 
quite encouraging, since the pieces 
used were not so acurate as could be 
desired. Mr. Pelikan is in charge of 
the class.
DRAMATIC CLUB GIVES 
PLEASING PERFORMANCE
The Margaret Morrison Dramatic 
Club gave its initial performance for 
the year on Friday evening, May 5, 
with the dramatization of Humper
dincks fairy tale, Hansel and Gretel. 
For a first performance the play mov
ed very smoothly and the spontaneity 
with which the characters took their 
parts compensated for the lack of fin
ish. Dorothy Turkic as Gretel was de
lightful and seemed truly a fairy child. 
Helen Senn as Hansel was convinc
ing. The witch, Rosina Daintyinouth, 
in the hands of Helen Clark called 
forth bursts of applause. Wilma 
Kurtz took the part of Sandman very 
delicately. The waits between acts 
were vory Interestingly passed with 
music by Bernice Kruger and vocal 
selections by Phyllis McMarlln.
After the play, a dance was given 
In Recreation Hall, under the auspices 
of the Guild. Music was furnished 
by Rhlel. The affair was very inform
al and about fifty people danced.

The Division on Woman's War 
Work of the Committee on Public In
formation published in January, 191S, 
a brochure entitled War Work of Wo
men in Colleges. This second bro
chure, published in April, contains 
supplementary information. It is not 
in any way a complete survey of the 
college war work of the country, but 
is a reportorial account of news which 
has been sent to this division. The 
fact that some colleges are not men
tioned does not mean that they are 
not carrying on extensive war activ
ities. Distinctive features have been 
taken from such letters and collegi
ate publications,as have been received 
to suggest useful lines of work, and 
thus be of service to students and 
colleges.
College War Courses
Smith College is offering for the 
second semester a course on indi
vidual and abnormal psychology in 
relation to mental reconstruction. 
This is intended to train students al
ready fitted by other cou/ses in the 
department for work in connection 
with the -re-education of disabled sol
diers. Reed College, Portland, Ore., 
began in March a special course of 
training for reconstruction aides as 
outlined by the Surgeon General. Re
construction aides are women em
ployed by the War Department to 
give remedial exercises to wounded 
soldiers in hospitals and other sani
tary formations of the Army. The 
statement, from Reed College reads:
The course comprises instruction 
in anatomy, physiology, personal hy
giene, posture, theory of bandaging, 
corrective gymnastics, and other re
medial exercises. Applicants must be 
between the ages of 20 and 40 years. 
In the words of the Surgeon General 
they must be capable of demonstra
ting team play, as it is essential that 
this new force have a standard and 
morale of the highest order. On this 
spirit, more than on any other thing, 
will be physical re-education of re
turned soldiers depend. Through an 
arrangement with the Red Cross, Dr. 
Bertha Stuart, head of the depart
ment of Physical Education for Wo
men at Reed College, is now in 
France for the study of European 
institutions and the rehabilitation of 
wounded men. In the meantime, the 
first course of training is starting at 
Portland, where Reed College ha's the 
cooperation of hospitals and ortho
pedic surgeons.
The Chicago School of Civics and 
Philanthropy is introducing a new 
course in curative occupations and 
recreations. The course is designed 
to train professional workers to deal 
with wounded and handicapped sol
diers. Lectures at the school wi 
cover the administration of public 
charitable institutions, medical prob
lems in relation to social work, the 
psychopathic principles in occupa
tional and recreational treatment, 
and social pathology- The, technical 
courses will cover those problems of 
recreation which have a curative val
ue and such departments of hand
work as weaving, cement work, and 
brushmaking.
The Utah Agricultural College has 
organized many extra sections in 
work of farm tractors, and one sec 
tion is composed of girls. Washing
ton State College is offering an 11- 
weeks course in Agriculture for wo
men in order to assist in solving im
perative war problems in farm work. 
A four-years combined agricultural 
and home economics course was of
fered for the first time at Iowa State 
College this fall. This was necessi
tated by the increasing number of 
women who are becoming farm own
ers and managers. At the University 
of Utah, every man in the university 
is required to devote an hour three 
times a week to military training, and 
every woman the same amount of 
time to Red Cross work.
Dr. Kristine Mann, director of the 
health clinic for industrial women in 
New York City, has asked one of the 
prominent womens colleges to es
tablish a summer course for officers 
to serve in the health department in 
the womens division of the Indus
trial Section Service of the Ordnance 
I Department. From 20 to 30 such of
ficers to look after the health of woI men employed in arsenals and other
iordnance plants- will be needed next 
fall. : One of the medical colleges is 
contemplating, at Dr. Manns sugges
tion, a course of this kind to turn 
out doctors of industrial health af
ter two years training.
Food Administration Commends Col
lege Response.
Colleges and universities which were 
not already giving courses in home 
economics were stimulated to do so 
during the second semester by the 
telegram which was sent on January 
15 to College presidents by Mr. Hoo
ver:
We need help all college women 
in stimulating conservation through
out country. Imperative to secure 
largest possible number well-informed 
people to assist in presenting food 
situation and methods which Food 
Administration is devising to meet.
Are all your women students receiv
ing instructions insuring intelligent 
cooperation with Food Administra
tion? Are you offering emergency 
courses which will enable some or all 
women graduating this year to be of 
special service? Would you welcome 
outlines and suggestions? Please re
ply telegram.
As the result of the splendid re
sponse from the colleges, and their 
declaration of cooperation, Mr. Hoo
ver sent to the heads of all institu
tions:
The United States Food Adminis
tration welcomes the American col
lege as a comrade in its fight against 
famine. The college man has been 
a surprise to the Nation. Without 
him the.American Army, now in the 
making, would have been a different, 
army. The Food Administration be
lieves that this miracle of the schools 
is to be repeated. It believes that 
the college woman may take an equal 
part in winning the war.
There will be food enough for us 
and the Allies if it can be properly 
distributed and used; but this in
volves many different problems. The 
greatest of these is the enlighten 
merit of the people. If the American 
people car, only know the truth about 
the situation, the food war will be 
won. But the science of food is in
tricate, and it is to be mastered on
ly by prolonged study and by trained 
minds. It is therefore a fit topic for 
college instruction. And it there 
are to be those who know the sub
ject in such a way as to be able to 
instruct the people, the college must 
teach, and the students must study, 
this subject. If there are those who I work.)
the Womens Committee of the Coun
cil of National Defense. She will 
speak on Woman's Work in the ,Com
munity; the functipn of the Woman's 
Committee of'the Council of National 
Defense in sending messages Trom 
the Government to women in stimu
lating patriotic service; and the sup
plying of women with a channel for 
the effective prosecution of war work 
and other national service.
Changes in the attitude of the col
lege girl toward the curriculum and 
her preparation for war service while 
in college are indicated in an ac
count of war-time education at the 
University of Chicago, which appear
ed in the Daily Maroou, of February
The following is a statement pre
pared by Dean Talbots office con
cerning preparation to be done by 
women during the war and after. 
There are two great problems: (1) 
Changes in education growing out 
of the immediate needs to help win 
the war; (L) changes growing out of 
prospective demands on women for 
reconstruction after the war.
Courses For Paid and Unpaid Workers
I. Courses to fit women during the 
war to help win the warin paid 
positions.
(a) For the college student:
(1) There is already a great de
mand for young women trained in 
recreation technique. For these po
sitions; which pay from $65 to $100 
a month, there is need of sufficient 
knowledge of anatomy and physiolo
gy to make them safe directors of re
creation activities among girls and 
children. With this they should have 
some knowledge of child psychology 
and they should be given the tech
nique of games; dances dramatics, 
etc. They can be used in positions 
in which they have the help of an 
older woman who holds a protective 
position, they can work among sur
roundings suitable for young women; 
and they can, after some experience, 
pass on to situations and responsi
bilities of a more serious character.
(2) There is an increasing demand 
for industrial welfare workers. They 
should be more mature than the re
creation workers discussed under (a 
1). but many of our students, with 
some additional training could qualify. 
They should have such courses as 
the labor course, the economic his
tory course, the industrial, public 
and personal hygiene, and some in
stitutional management (canteen
tion for later training as inspectors; I 
visiting nurses, visiting teachers, and 
research workers in the physical and 
biological field.
Women students desiring, to plan 
their future work along any of the 
lines suggested are invited to confer 
with Dean Talbot in her office in 
Cobb Hall.
FOOD CONSERVATION
deny the propriety of such collegiat 
instruction, it can only be replied 
that the American college can do 
nothing more worthy of its traditions 
and of its professions than to help 
in saving civilization.
The Food Administration regrets 
that it so long delayed its appeal to 
the colleges. The simple truth is 
that their readiness and ability to 
render assistance were underestima
ted. And yet it is not too late. It is 
still possible this year for college 
women in America to acquire the 
foundation facts regarding the food 
situation, so that she will not only 
live her own life rightly but will 
lead others to do the same, it is 
still possible for a large proportion 
of these women to learn much re
garding the nutritive values of var
ious forms of food so that they may 
teach and give helpful i.ounsel.
As an aid to the colleges not al
ready doing these things three courses 
have tieen planned. Outlines of these 
are being prepared by competent au
thorities chosen from Government, de
partments and from some of the 
leading Institutions of learning. It is 
the intention to mail each week these 
outlines with appropriate references 
and the freshest available informa
tion. It is' not expected that these 
courses will, take the place of simi
lar and perhaps more extensive' ones 
given in institutions which maintain 
departments of home economics. Even 
in these, however, it may be- found 
that the outlines contain material 
that can be incorporated profitably 
into such established courses.
The first course will give the his
tory and the organization of the Food 
Administration, its purposes and pol 
icies, as well as the most important 
facts regarding the world food situ
ation. These are the things essen
tial to an intelligent public opinion 
at this time. It is therefore confi
dently hoped that all colleges can 
find a place for it, and that it may 
be offered in such a manner that 
every woman student will be enroll 
ed in it. There is no reason why 
men students should not be admitted.
The Food Administration will be 
sincerely grateful to every education
al institution that will lend a hand 
in this world crisis. It will renderall possible assistance in every en
deavor to make highly effective the 
proposed instruction. Those who are 
in charge of the Food Administration 
permit themselves the new pleasure 
of comradeship in arms with the ed
ucational institutions of America."
Geat Variety in Courses Offered
Community Centers and Democra
cy is the title of the new national 
service course at Columbia Univer
sity, New York City. This course is 
open to both men and women, ft is 
the first one to be given in response 
to the campaign for the school as a 
community center that is being car
ried on by the Council of National 
Defense and the Bureau of Educa
tion. The university is giving these 
courses to train the student to be of 
aid in assisting the official machin
ery of the Council of National De
fense to reach into the smallest com
munities, to mobilize and make avail
able the efforts of the people for the 
prosecution- of the war. One of the 
speakers of the course will be Mrs. 
Martha Evans Martin, representing
(3) With the assumption of geater 
centralization in the control of in
dustry, the quality of inspectional 
work will rise. Already the Child 
Labor Division of the Childrens Bu
reau is demanding a new type of fac
tory Inspector. The Pood Inspection 
Service will offer opportunities for 
women, as.will also the Public Health 
Service'. The first should be trained 
in labor problems and in indusmai 
hygiene; the second in food analysis 
and bacteriology; and the third in hy
giene, housing, and social and econ
omic conditions.
(b) For mature studentse. g., 
those who have had teaching -exper
ience or women who have been mar
ried:
(1) Protective scout work, po
lice women. There is a great oppor 
tunity in protective" or scout 
work. Mr. Hobens course on juven 
ile delinquency, the child and the 
State, the social treatment of crime, 
and abnormal psychology are among 
the courses that: would be useful. 
Some evening practice work could be 
provided.
() Canteen work. Hostess Hut 
work, l'jor this Lhe study of institu
tional management, the buying ol 
food, serving, and the preparation ol 
food in large quantities will be nec
essity, together with a line social 
sense.
(8) Reconstruction work in reclaim 
ed areas.
Ii. Courses to train women to help 
win the warin unpaid positions. 
These would include first aid and 
other Red Cross work, food conser
vation and control, and any training 
which would enable young women to 
speak and write and otherwise co
operate intelligently in directing pub
lic opinion and performing the duties 
of citizens.
III. Looking toward the coming oi 
peace.
(a) There will probably be a 
change in the general attitude toward 
womans work, because of, among 
other things:
(1) The number of women whose 
husbands will have been killed or 
maimed.
(2) The probable reduction in the 
so-called leisure class, due to taxa
tion.
(3) T.lie Russian Revolution and 
such other revolutionary movements 
as develop.
(4) The extension of suffrage to 
women.
(b) The college woman should, 
from the beginning of her course, 
recognize the probability of becom
ing self-supporting, and should lay 
stress on such training as equips for 
paid work. Punctuality, regularity, 
definiteness, responsibility, are to bo 
sought. Each student should take 
Herself in hand and develop a sense 
of responsibility and acquire through 
practice the power of rendering effi
cient service.
(c) All students should prepare for 
citizenship, and should therefore take 
courses in economics, government, and 
pesonal and social hygiene as prepar
ation for life under the a new inter
national order. For women, courses 
in the sciences that underlie the se
lection and preparation of food and 
the care of children in the home and 
in the school should be selected, so 
far as possible, in groups as preparaIS WHEAT INDISPENSABLE IN 
OUR DIET?
A committee of experts was recently 
assembled by the Food Administration 
to consider the special physiological 
problems involved in the general prob-j 
lem of wheat conservation. This com-! 
mittee was composed of the following! 
men:
Dr. R. H. Chittenden, professor of 
physiological chemistry and dean of 
Sheffield Scientific School at Yale; Dr. 
Graham Lusk, professor of physiology 
at Cornell University; Dr. E. V. Mc
Collum. professor of bio-chemistry at 
Johns Hopkins University; Dr. L. B. 
Mendel, professor of physiological 
chemistry at Yale; C. L. Alsberg, chief 
of the Bureau of Chemistry of the 
Unied States Department of Agricul
ture; Dr. F. C. Langworthy, chief of 
the home economics division of the 
State Extension Service, United States 
Department of Agriculture; Prof. Ver
non Kellogg, of Stanford University; 
Dr. Alonzo E. Taylor, professor of 
physiological chemistry at the Univer
sity of Pennsylvania; Dr. Raymond 
Pearl, of the School of Hygiene of 
Johns Hopkins University; and Dr. 
Ray Lyman Wilbur, formerly dean of 
the Stanford University Medical School 
and now president of the university. 
No group of higher physiological au
thority could be assembled in this 
country.
The question most seriously asked of 
this committee by the Food Adminis
tration was: To what extent can the 
wheat to which we are now accustom
ed in our diet be reduced without in-i 
jury to the health of the individuals of 
the Nation?
The answer was direct and unequivo
cal. It is the scientific opinion of the 
ommittee that in a mixed diet wheat 
may be entirely replaced, without 
harm, by other valuable cereals, name
ly, rice, barley, oats, and corn. How
ever, we should not; recommend this 
except as an emergency measure.
The report then explains that the 
particular reason for not recommend
ing this, apart from the fact that wheat 
is perhaps the most convenient cereal 
for use because of its special qualities 
connected with the making of broad in 
loaves that will stand up and remain 
sweet and palatable for several days, 
is that going without wheat would be 
a psychological, though not a. physiolo
gical, deprivation. We are accustomed 
as a nation, just as most of the nations 
of Europe are, to the use of wheat 
broad, and a sudden break in our cus
tom would have for some people a 
psychological significance, more or less 
disturbing.
However, if these people could well 
understand the emergency leading to 
the change, and then could recognize 
that they were aiding their country in 
the great emergency by making the 
change this psychological disturbance 
would be much redueod.
Exactly this condition of a great na
tional emergency, for the meeting of 
which the loyal and patriotic efforts oi 
all the people aro neoded, is the condi
tion today. It is only because oi this 
.great national emergency that the Food 
Administration makes use of this de
liberate judgment of the physiological 
experts called in for advice.
Even under these circumstances it is 
recognized that because of the econorn 
ic and commercial reasons not all of 
the people of the country can go with
out bread based on wheat, but it is 
certain that a great many people in 
this country can easily do this, and 
it is the belief of the Food Adminis
tration that most of the people in 
this country who can dispense entire
ly with wheat from nowr until the 
next harvest will be glad to do it for 
the sake of maintaining the wheatbread supply for the armies and 
civilians of our fighting associates in 
Europe as well as our own soldiers 
in FranceCONSERVATION ALL ALONG THE 
LINE
We have come accustomed to the 
idea of conservation by the consumer 
and we have come to know some
thing about conservation by the man
ufacturer and in trade practices. 
There still remains a broad field in 
which waste is possible, and to which 
measures of saving may be applied, 
A movement has been projected 
through conference of many of the 
agencies interested by which there 
may result a reduction in the waste 
of thrashing wheat. One authority 
states that in the State of Kansas 
alone there is an annual waste in 
thrashing of over 2,000,000 bushels. 
The amount of the wheat crop lost 
to Lhe Nation, according to some au 
thorities, may run from 1 to 10 per 
cent. The grain thrashing division 
of the United States Grain Corpora
tion, cooperating with county thrash
ing  committees throughout the Na
tion, is undertaking to solve this 
problem of waste at the source. Hero 
Is a fundamental step In conserva
tion. one which calls for the sympa
thetic cooperation of everyone con
cerned.

from a small pocket dictionary, while 
a little French maid waits patiently 
and tries hard not to smilein any 
other country it would be a task, 
here everyone usually has a good 
laugh over our efforts when we give 
the signal by starting it oureslves.
The more I see of, it the more I ad
mire the spirit of the French people. 
In spite of their ruined villages and the 
heavy cost of the war in life and 
money, their spirit 1 as cheerful, as 
courteous, and as dauntless, as in the 
first days of the struggle. All this ter
ritory was swept in the first German 
drive, some of the houses still lie in 
ruins, the little church in the village 
is a shell, its steeple aslant and great 
breaches in the walls where the Ger
man artillery has played havoc. And 
all through the- fields or in lonely 
strips of woodland one comes on 
graves, marked by a rough wooden 
cross, where men have fallen in the 
open warfare of the early struggle. If 
those at home could only see these 
things as we see them.
March 31: Now the big drive Is
on, instruction is about over and we 
are anxiously hoping we will get a 
chance to get into it. All night long, 
and all day, the steady march of feet 
goes on, into the north, interspersed 
with the rumble of artillery trains and 
ammunition trucks. And at night we 
often waken to hear the deep pulsing 
detonations of the big guns, and some
times the light of their flashes can be 
seen. And fleets ot aeroplanes pass 
over, like flocks of tiny white moths 
high in the air, on into the north, 
where lies the great vortex that Is 
drawing all these things.
It is not pleasant to have to deny 
the pull. We sit and await orders. I 
suppose our first ones will assign us 
to troops, and that means months 
more of drilling and preparation. But 
all things seem to point to the fact that 
America is going to stay, so I reckon 
we will get our chance.

NIGHT SCHOOL DANCE AT UNION MAY 10
Considerable time and work has 
been devoted to making the Inter-nite 
dance at the Union this year a huge 
success. Last year the dance was in
stituted through the efforts of the 
Klannicht and was a great success al
though it was somewhat of an experi
ment. Now it is the one really big 
affair of the Night Schools and serves 
a big purpose in getting together stu
dents of all four schools.
This year especially has been a try
ing year, with many of the best men 
leaving for service, and the remainder 
looking around for their particular 
niche in the big job, the spirit for 
class affairs lias lagged considerably. 
This affair will therefore help to keep 
up the school spirit and in spite of un
favorable conditions, the preparations 
made will insure a real success. The 
musical program and lunch service 
has been given considerable care and 
attention and is sure to please. As 
admission will be by invitation only, 
all those who intend to come should 
see their class presidents or represen
tatives about, their invitations.
May 10 will be the big night for the 
Night Science Seniors, as they will 
have both their commencement and 
the Inter-nite dance that evening. It 
will all help to make that evening a 
memorable one.
Life is the first of pointers. There 
is no object so foul that intense light 
will not make it beautifulEmerson.

Carter C. MacMillan, 14, First 
Lieutenant in the Coast Artillery 
Corps now in France, a member of 
of the Lc/Lh Clan and Varsity Clan 
and doubtless known to some of the 
older Tech men, writes as follows: 
Heavy Artillery School.
France, March 21 1918.
This week I found in my mail a 
copy of the Alumnus. It brought 
Tech very close again and I thought 
perhaps some of my old friends there 
would be interested in our activities 
over here.
When my M. E. degree was safely 
deposited beside the B. S. formerly 
garnered I had a big fat idea that 
I was done with school. I was 
wrong. Within two months I was 
headed for the Coast Artillery school 
at Fort Monroe and a three months 
course in the O. T. C. thaL made even 
Sophomore math seem like a holiday. 
Graduating there in due season I 
was one of the fortunate volunteers 
selected for work abroad.
We suffered the due perils of sea
sickness and submarines, wandered 
about France on narrow gauge trains 
at a speed of ten miles per hour and 
reached destination eventually at an
other artillery school. When each 
shot on a big gun costs over 1,000 
dollars it is evident they don't want 
us to waste them by depositing them 
carefully where Fritz is not. Also 
as the target may lie at a distance 
of 15 miles from the gun and per
haps a few hundred yards from our 
trenches very accurate, work is nec
essary. Such small factors as curva
ture and rotation of the earth have 
to be corrected for, as well as some 
dozen other factors. One slide rule 
recently made for this work uses over 
twenty-four slides and scales. It is 
some machine and can do everything 
but ball the gun commander out for 
leaving grit on the shells. It cannot 
do that as it is made of celluloid 
and not asbestos.
So we admit that much prepara
tion is necessary, but we are getting 
nvettv well fed up on it. T have to
rebabblt the bearings in my old slip 
stick about once a week and had 
my fountain pen point water-jacketed. 
Except the momentary halt at the 
week-end we. are at work steadily 
from revielle to taps, unless the 
lights go out at an air-raid warning.'
Here is another verse that we have 
added to our Coast Artillery song, 
which perhaps McCorkle has given 
you:
Left school in America, came over 
here to fight,
They sent us to the H. A. school, we 
study day and night.
And when the school is over and 
they've shot us full of dope, 
Theyll send us to another school of 
slightly wider scope.
Clior: Laborious, laborious, etc.
But if we study well we can give 
the Kaiser hell 
And well calculate the Germans out 
of France.
Week-ends offer a slight respite 
and an opportunity to see a part of 
France that lies aside from the tourist 
routes, where shopkeepers still charge 
Fronch prices, and where the sight 
of a Stetson is still so unusual that 
the cry Americane from some little 
urchin brings a cascade of youngsters 
from every doorway and courtyard, 
and not a few curious elders further 
in the background.
Often some little Frenchie, wise in 
military lore, will gravely stand at at
tention and give the military salute, 
with a "bon jour, Monsier Americane, 
followed often by a request for un 
sou," which may be anything from 
a copper clacker to a coat button. If 
one starts to distribute souvenirs 
through a village he had best take 
along a cartload of buttons, for the 
news quickly spreads and the rapidity 
with which the crowd, augments is 
startling.
As one should not use the railroads 
except on military business, most of 
these excursions are made on foot or 
bicycle and one can find many quaint 
experiences and adventures tramping 
through this old land of the troubad
ours with a wad of wall paper (paper 
money), an open mind, and a vocab
ulary of half a dozen words. When 
one has to dig requests for board and 
bed: for dinner, soap and hot water,
