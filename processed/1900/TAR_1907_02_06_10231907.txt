4THE TARTAN
Manager Buck Thomson Speaks in 
Behalf of the Team.
From time immemorial it has been 
the custom of the vanquished to offer 
excuses for their defeat; so common 
has such a custom become that one 
naturally expects and even looks for 
it, and yet when it comes the public 
rr.ise their voices and proclaim 
quitters.
Fearing that there might be just 
one who would be so unjust as to 
make this criticism in regard 3 to our 
foot-ball team, take this oppor
tunity to champion their cause, not 
from the standpoint of one connected 
with the-team alone, but as a spec
tator. From the outstart it could be 
seen that there was little chance of 
victory; a team can play against an
other one and go down in defeat with 
honor, but they cannot play against 
the combined forces of the team and 
officials, especially when the said offi
cials are all connected with the 
school which the opposing team rep
resents. The referee was a West
minster alumnus, the umpire a Sen
ior, and the head linesman a member 
of the 09 classbeat that combina
tionimpossible.
The question may now arise why 
did we not have officials of our own? 
Arrangements had been made for 
two men, but they disappointed.
For our defeat of Saturday I con 
sider myself more at fault than th^ 
team, because it is the duty of the 
manager to see that such things are 
guarded against; the old saying 
Live and learn, was forcibly im
pressed upon me as well as the ex
pression, When a mans down kick 
him. That is what was done, see
ing and realizing that we were at 
their mercy they took every advan
tage they could.
If a good, clean game had been 
desired by them how easy it would 
have been to secure it. It was sug
gested that each team allow its coach 
to act as an official, but they refused 
to listen to this suggestion.
There was not a single penaliza
tion for offside play during the entire 
game. Is that not remarkable? With 
competent officials the score would 
have been reversed even though there 
were four subs in our line.
The team was by no means the one 
that played against W. U. P., although
not as good they deserve nothing but 
the highest praise for tne manner in 
which they made an uphill fight.
It would be easy to give the various 
illegal plays and formations, but it 
would take too long to enumerate 
them.
In conclusion I merely ask that 
criticism be withheld and, and that 
the fellows of the team be shown that 
their students are behind them, and 
still have confidence; if this is done 
then you will see that a new team 
will be moulded from the old one 
that will be victorious and an honor 
to our Alma MaterCarnegie Tech.

The regular Night School opened 
for the year 1907-1908 sessions on 
Monday evening, the schedule re
quiring attendance four nights weekly 
was explained by the Director in his 
address to the class assembled in 
Machinery Hall. The schedule will 
mean a strenuous year for 1910, and 
at first did not strike much favor, 
but after the remarks of the Director, 
the boys held a meeting and a ^oce 
was taken, jthe result being that 
the schedule as arranged be given 
a trial for one month and if at the 
end of this time it was found too 
stiong the Director was to be ap
proached with the suggestion to cut 
down the number of | weekly peri
ods.
The months trial was suggested, 
by the Director, and he remarked 
that what the class of 1910 decided 
upon as to the length of sessions 
each week would be established for 
each class following.
The reorganization meeting of the 
class was held in Machinery Hall on 
Monday evening at 9 oclock, at which 
time the following officers were 
elected to serve for the entire school 
year:
PresidentGeorge V. Smith.
Vice PresidentJas. W. Herron.
Secretary-TreasurerJas. K. Reed.
HistorianR. C. Frank.
Class AdvisorDr. Hower.
The elections were very spirited 
and close. The result showed no 
ballot for President, and Mr. Smith 
was elected by acclamation.
Several new faces appear in the 
class and we extend a cordial greet
ing to our new members and trust 
they will uphold the reputation of
1910 for good work and strict atten
tion to studies.
John Skeehan, former President of 
the class was married on Tuesday, 
October 16th. Heres to you, Jack, 
and may your sons become students 
of Carnegie Tech, and be as good as 
their dad.
If Coach Thompson would come 
out and look over the foot-ball mate
rial there is in 1910 he would be 
able to strengthen the team consid
erably. Williams, Smith, Lautenschlager and George, are all experi
enced players, and have reputations 
gained from star playing with well 
known teams in this section of the 
country.
The Mandolin and Guitar Club has 
re-organized. Any mandolin or gui
tar player wishing to try for member
ship should send his name to J. H. 
Taxis, President Night Class. 1910. 
Come out, boys, and help make this 
the dandy team.
Summers has just come back from 
Youngstown, where he was sent to 
take charge of some very important 
work for the firm by whom he is em
ployed.
Taylors oratory has not depreci
ated during vacation as was mani
fested in the class meeting Monday 
night.
Rodgers has x-ecovered from his 
serious illness and is with us again 
to try four nights a week.

Cross-Country Runs.
Coach Thompson announces that 
the first cross-country run will take 
place Friday, October 24, the second 
on October 31, and the third on 
Thanksgiving Day.
Prospects for a first-class track 
team keep right on improving every 
week. A new hurdler will be out who 
will make Wink Dowling hustle to 
keep in the front. A couple of halfmile and mile men from the Plebe 
Class who are sure winners are also 
out for the team. And last Friday 
the writer was informed that a polevaulter of championship calibre would 
be on deck, besides a couple of very 
likely weight men.

A Former Tech Girl Is Honored.
Last Saturday afternoon 'liss Mary 
McKee, of Tioga street, Brushton, 
gave a very nicely arranged kitchen 
shower for Mrs. Walter K. Adams, 
who was formerly Miss Susanna Hoff
man and a member of M. M. C. S., 
1909. The guest of honor received a 
number of useful kitchen utensils, 
among which was a rolling pin. (We 
are sorry for Pete). About fourteen 
girls were present, among whom were 
the Misses Ada Ramlach, Mary Pfeil, 
Frances Looney, Ella Connelly, Rhea 
Stewart, Hattie Merrill, Grace Grif
fin, Lucille Sawhill, Alice McKelvey, 
and a frequent school visitor, Miss 1 
Jean Huston. Refreshments were 
served in the colors of the class of 
1909.
Notice to Out-of-Town Students.
At present it has been decided not 
to start a dormitory. Girls wishing 
to change their boarding places will 
be given the names of desirable 
houses in the vicinity by applying 
either to Miss Smith or Mrs. Philput.
The Graduate Nurses Association 
now in convention in Pittsburg, re
sponded to the invitation of Director 
Hamerschlag and visited the M. M.
C. S. Friday morning. They ex
pressed themselves as being very 
much interested and delighted with 
the plans and workings of the school. 
Miss West made an address at one 
of the meetings of the convention on 
.The Value of a Board of Education 
for Women in every occupation in 
life.
Miss Jane Adams, of Hull House, 
Chicago, is to lecture in Carnegie 
Music Hall on October 28. She has 
chosen as one of her subjects, The 
Social Waste of Child Labor. This 
should be very interesting to all of 
our students, especially to those who 
have taken the course in Economics.
The fame of the M. M. C. S. has 
spread even to the diminutive peoples 
of the land. Four little girls appear
ed at the entrance on Friday after| noon, and expressed a wish to see 
j the school. They were conducted 
with due ceremony through the dif
ferent departments, but the little 
ladies were so awed by everything 
they saw, that we cannot criticise 
them for not making the compli
mentary remarks we are accustomed 
to hear.
In last weeks Tartan we hinted at 
the depression that the mutism of 
nightingales has made us feel. We 
hoped that this gentle reminder would 
stimulate our songstresses, and force 
them to forsake retirement, and be 
once more with us. Nothing has come 
of this. The Glee Club has not ma
terialized, and, if news come to us 
rightly, is not thinking of organizing 
for the season.
What is the matter with the girls? 
Do they lack initiative? If so, why do 
tney not profit by the example given 
by the boys school? Societies of all 
| kinds have started in the buildings 
across the Campusthe Literary So
cieties, the Glee Club, etc., etc., are 
getting ready to furnish entertainment 
to the student body as soon as the 
activities of the gridiron warriors 
have subsided. What about us? Are 
we going to wake up at all and start 
things going, or let them to slide this 
year until it is too late to accomplish 
anything?
Think it over, girls!

Mr. Wood says the easiest way to 
subtract is by adding.
The 1910 class has invented a new 
fly-catcher in the shape of one of the 
girls. We hope, for her sake, that 
the invention is not patented.
Juniors Hold Election.
The Juniors certainly showed the 
amount of class spirit they really do 
possess, on Monday afternoon when a 
hotly contested election took place. 
As a result the following officers were 
chosen:
President, Ada Ramlack.
Vice President, Lucile Sawhill.
Secretary, Edna Smith.
Treasurer, Nancy Herron.
Marshals, Mary McKee and Anne 
Selheimer.
At this time the Tartan and Thistle 
representatives were also chosen. As 
editor, Mabel Corbould, certainly will 
fill the position, as well as our allotted 
pages of the weekly paper. Frances 
Looney was elected business manager 
and hopes to greatly increase the num
ber of sales and subscriptions of the 
Tartan. Rebekah Shuman was chosen 
as editor for the Thistle. We hope 
to see nearly one-third of it occupied 
by the- news of the Margaret Morrison 
Carnegie School, as Miss Shuman has 
great ability in that kind of work.
1911.
One regretable feature of the re
union of the Class of 1911 was the 
non-appearance of President Harley.
Mr. Harley is compelled to abandon 
his course at Tech. owing to the great 
demand on his time, which his new 
duties as assistant to the master me
chanic at the Republic Iron Works, 
entail.
Our fair-haired president was in
defatigable in promoting the interests 
of the class and could always be de
pended upon to perform his full share 
of the work of any venture undertaken 
by the class as an organization. In 
the chair he was an able parliamentar
ian and always had a valuable sugges
tion or pertinent remark upon any 
subject, and many a knotty problem 
owes its solution or amicable adjust
ment to his good judgment and sound 
common sense.
When elected to the presidency of
the class Mr. Harley was very little 
known, but it is safe to say that at 
the close of last term, there was not 
a more popular night student at Tech. 
His many friends at the M. M. C. S. 
(he was quite a fusser) will be 
sorry to learn of his withdrawal, but 
join with all the others who know 
him, in wishing him well in his new 
field of endeavor.
Readers of the Tartan will no doubt 
recall an article on a sleigh ride held 
by the Class of 1911 last winter. This 
event was planned and executed by 
several of the more prominent 1911 
men, and directly attributable to this 
affair was the pretty little romance 
which culminated in joining of hands 
and hearts at Hymens Altar, of Hugh
D. Farrel and Miss Watkins of Pitts
burg, Pa. Mr. and Mrs. Farrel are 
hereby assured of the best wishes and 
congratulations of 1911.

How do you make that out?
Well, if you cleave it longitudinally 
dont you have one eye, one nostril, 
two legs, etc., in each section and are 
not both ends butt-ends?
The delegation of 1911 men who, on 
the opening night greeted the day 
men at their quarters, were treated 
with but scant courtesy by their day 
brethren. The effect of the treatment 
on the nocturnals is shown by Hesss 
remark, Well, you cant make me 
mad.
Some of the night men are prac
ticing a little football. The quarter
back kick is a favorite play, but the 
practice usually ends when the centre 
(always a new man) receives the kick 
on that part of his anatomy which is 
brought into undue prominence by 
virtue of his stooping position.

STUDENT HONOR SYSTEM.
In view of the interest taken by 
C. T. S. students in the honor system, 
perhaps it might be well to quote 
what another college paper has to 
say regarding the honor code at Yale:
In taking their stand against the 
adoption of the honor system, the 
Seniors of Yale University have 
placed themselves in a unique posi
tion before the intercollegiate world 
and the public generally. Their ac
tion this week will doubtless call 
forth agood deal of discussion among 
those interested, and in all likelihood 
arouse the ire of the advocates of 
the system. But whatever attitude 
people may choose to take in the 
matter, no one can help but admire 
the independence and the spirit of 
sincere conviction which has charac
terized the decision of the Yale Sen
ior class.
For our own part, we are inclined 
to think that they have come nearer 
to attaining the highest ideal of class
room ethics than they would, had 
they agreed to put into opera
tion a system designed for that 
purpose. As the Yale News ex
presses it, they have adopted the 
spirit of honor rather than a system 
which imposes perfunctory accept
ance on the part of the few refrac
tory members of every class, and de
mands of every student that he keep 
a vigilant eye upon the methods of 
his neighbor in examinations. No 
better standard can be upheld by 
any university than that which the 
Yale Seniors have adopted in the 
following resolutions:
First. That we place ourselves on 
record as standing for absolute hon
esty and gentlemanly conduct in 
class-room and in examinations. We 
believe that a simple honor system, 
based on the individual is ideal but 
impracticable because of the size of 
the class and the lack of any provision 
for dealing with any offense that 
might arise.
Second. That we do not wish to 
undertake the responsibility of de
tecting, reporting or punishing dis
honesty which may occur, because we 
believe that the student body with no 
experience in such matters, is unable 
to perform such a duty to the best 
interests of the University.
Third. That we believe that such 
supervision as is necessary to pre
vent dishonesty can be more con
veniently and thoroughly performed 
by the faculty than by the student 
body or a student committee, inas
much as it is to be supposed that the 
time of the students in the recitations 
and examinations is entirely occu
pied in doing the work thereof.
We venture to predict that the re
sults of their action will fully justify 
the rejection of the honor system, 
popular opinion to the contrary not
withstanding.
about the matter, but it is hoped that 
they will agree with the plan.
The girls will be given either one 
or two pages somewhere near the 
center of the paper, where the names 
of their editorial staff will appear 
and where such matter as they see 
fit shall be printed.
DONT GIVE UP THE SHIP.
These words are meant for those 
members of the Junior and Senior 
classes who have been noticed lately 
reading the employment notices and 
speculating on the chances of getting 
a job immediately. It will be re
membered that the same thing oc
curred at the beginning of last year 
and perhaps will occur again in the 
future. It is naturally hard for stu
dents who have been working with 
their hands or taking it easy all sum
mer to get down to the hard, steady, 
head work, which is required to pass 
with any kind of credit. So, dont lose 
heart and perhaps every day will be 
Sunday bye and bye.
Saturdays Foot-ball Results.
A NEW PLAN.
Before another issue of the Tartan 
appears it is hoped that the girls at 
the Margaret Morrison Carnegie 
School will have settled definitely on 
a plan for their representation in the 
Tartan. As the matter stands at the 
present writing they are to have an 
Editor-in-Chief, who will look after 
assignments of articles to her assist
ants, the correspondents. They will 
have their own Business Manager, 
who will look after the selling of the 
Tartan. It is not yet definitely known 
what the night students are to do

The Many Uses of Refrigerating 
Machines.
Aside from the usefulness of refrig
erating machines for producing cold 
for the preserving of stores and food 
products, there are many other ap
plications to which it is put in other 
industries. For instance, the produc
tion of commercial chocolate requires 
during certain stages of its manufac
ture the use of artificial cold. The 
seed having been ground into a fine 
powder, it is formed into a pasty mass 
and moulded. To produce the best 
results, the chocolate must be hard
ened at a certain temperature. This 
it was found could not be accom
plished during the warmer months of 
the summer season without the use 
of refrigeration, so that there are 
now few, if any, factories for the pro
duction of chocolate that are without 
some means of artificial refrigeration.
In the manufacture of paraffin, re
frigeration forms a necessaiy part of 
the production. After the wax has 
been thoroughly freed of impurities by 
succsesful washings, it is run into 
moulds of convenient sizes and there 
allowed to harden. Before the days 
of the manufacture of artificial cold, 
this took some time but now it is a 
comparatively short operation. An
other method is to keep the mixture 
of araffin and oils in a long cylinder 
within which rotates a drum. The 
drum is hollow and by means of hol
low trunions has current of cold 
brine circulated through it from a 
suitable refrigerating machine. The 
result is that oil adheres to the sur
face of the cylinder, being reduced to 
a plastic state by the cold. Scrapers 
afterward take off this accumulation 
and thus the separation and thus the 
separation of paraffin and oil is ob
tained. So common has refrigeration 
become in paraffin works that it is 
deemed an almost indispensable fac
tor in the manufacture of this article 
of trade.
In the manufacture of artificial but
ter the ingredients are melted to
gether and run into churns, where 
they are thoroughly agitated and 
mixed. Then the churns are opened 
and the contents drained, out suddenly 
into open tanks containing an in
tensely cold body of water. The sud
den change from warmth to a low 
temperature causes the particles of 
butter to crystalize and allows them 
to float on the surface while the water 
carries away all residue, which if al
lowed to remain would soon cause 
decomposition.
In the dynamite industry, refrig
eration plays an important part as well 
as in the manufacture of nitro-glycerine. It is well known that it is quite 
difficult to explode dynamite when 
frozen, so that this is made a method 
of handling it with safety. Dynamite 
is nothing more than nitro-glycerine 
mixed with kieselguhr. The nitro
glycerine is prepared in small quan
tities by dropping glycerine into a 
mixture of strong nitric and sulphuric 
acids, the temperature being kept as 
low as possible by means of refriger
ating apparatus. This not only aids 
the action but lessens the danger of 
the operation.
In the distillation of spirits, there 
is an opportunity for the use of re
frigeration. The vapors, after being 
driven off from the retort or still, are 
carried into the condenser, where a 
circulation of cold water reduces the 
vapor to a liquid. The colder the 
condensing liquid, the more rapid the 
condensation, and thus the brine sys
tem again forms a convenient method 
of securing a sufficient degree of cold. 
Moreover, after the liquors are fur
nished and stored away, there must 
be a certain degree of coldness in 
the store room or else there will be 
excessive loss of evaporation.
The manufacturers of photographic 
supplies find refrigeration beneficial to 
no small degree when making dry 
plates and films, inasmuch as it is 
the means of cooling the gelatinous 
surfaces which heat would cause to 
run or become streaky. Chemical 
works producing crystalized products
find it very advantageous. Sugar re
fineries use it to freeze watery par
ticles out of sugary juices. India 
rubber works cure and harden blocks 
or sheets of rubber by th.s means, 
enabling the sheets to be cut after
wards into any size and shape desira
ble with little trouble. Glue factories 
also use it to dry the gelatine.
One unique use of refrigeration is 
for freezing loose ground or ground 
containing much sand and water so 
that the sinking of wells, shafts or 
other similar engineering enterprises 
can be facilitated. In case the earth 
to be dug is so shifty as to follow up 
the boring tool and fill up the shaft as 
fast as i t is sunk, the ground may 
be frozen until it becomes solid 
enough to withstand pressure. Such 
a method is a costly one; but it is said 
to have been carried cut in more than 
one instance. The method employed 
is to take a circular row of pipes in 
the ground near which the excavation 
is to be made. These pipes are fitted 
so as to enable a brine circulation to 
be sent through them. This freezes 
the quicksand or silt and enables it 
to be removed like clinging earth. 
Having dug to the limit of the freez
ing, the brine pipes may again be 
sunk at a lower level and the digging 
continued. As fast as the shaft is 
dug, it would be necessary to put in 
a lining to hold the outer earth when 
it should thaw.
There is one application of refrig
eration that far exceeds all of those 
mentioned and that is in breweries. 
By its use there is an improvement in 
the quality of the drink, complete con
trol of the fermentation and cooling, 
and a consequent cheapening of the 
cost of manufacture.From the Prac
tical Engineer.

CARBON AND IRON.
It has now been demonstrated that 
the reason copper and iron will not 
alloy is on account of the carbon that 
the iron absorbs in melting. If the 
iron and copper be melted together 
in a clay crucible so that no carbon 
can be taken up, the resulting alloy 
is perfectly homogenious and free 
from any separated nodules.
Technical Literature and Technical 
Students.
Perhaps a few students have no
ticed how little attention is paid by 
the students of the Carnegie Techni
cal Schools to the great amount of 
technical information which is to be 
found in the Carnegie Library in the 
periodical press. It seems that every 
time the average student has an hour 
or two of spare time he feels rather 
inclined to match pennies or do some
thing equally worthless than to spend 
a few moments walking over to the 
Library, where the time could be em
ployed to good advantage. A possi
ble exception to this rule is to be 
found in those students who have done 
serious work before entering school. 
They seem to have a clearer idea of 
the value of technical papers than 
those students who have done nothing 
but go to school since they were old 
enough.
The value of the Carnegie Library 
as a storehouse of infcrrmation will 
only be apparent to some of us after 
we have left school and the city, for 
other places where such opportuni
ties are not to be found. Indeed, 
several students who are regular resi
dents of the city have confessed that 
they were not so anxious to leave the 
city to work because of the number 
of times the Library has helped them 
solve difficult problems of all kinds.
If the students would pay more at
tention to what is going on in the 
engineering and industrial world, per
haps they would find that studies
which before had appeared very dry 
and uninteresting would be seen in a 
new light. Then, perhaps we would 
not hear so much talk of flunking or 
Quitting.

Review of Saturday Games.
From the outcome of some of the 
foot-ball games in college circles on 
Saturday, it begins to look as though 
the new rules were beginning to get 
in their good work and to give the 
smaller teams a much greater chance 
than would be possible under the old 
system.
Perhaps the most remarkable game 
was the fine showing made by the 
Army against Yale at West Point. 
The Yale line was solid and heavy 
enough to withstand the attacks of 
the cadet backfield, but Elis backfield was too uncertain on the forward 
pass.' This uncertainty coupled with 
penalties, helped the Army men won
derfully and a no score game resulted.
Harvard might have met the same 
fate at the hands of the Navy if it 
had not been for the fine kicking done 
by the Harvard backfield. Apparent
ly the Harvard team has not yet got
ten down to hard work, and when 
she does will probably be able to 
make a good showing if she does 
not actually beat Yale.
Cornell was unfortunate enough to 
have a nervous quarterback and con
sequently his unsteadiness lost the 
game to State by the close score of
8 to 6.
Pennsylvania had a hard game with 
Brown which has been described by 
experts as the fastest game in a long 
time. Penn has been rather afraid 
of the boys in Providence all season 
and only succeeded in beating them 
by rushing them off their feet in the 
first part of the game.
The harm which may come to a 
team through winning against weaker 
rivals was amply shown up in the 
Princeton-W. & J. game. The boys 
from Washington evidently had a lit
tle case of swelled head, caused by 
a string of victories early in the sea
son.

The Danger of Overspecialization.
Dr. Leo Baekeland, equally distin
guished as the inventor of velox 
paper for photographical purposes, 
and as the chemical engineer who 
reduced the Townsend electrotype 
cell to practice on a large scale in the 
new alkili and chlorine works in Ni
agara Falls, recently addressed the 
New York Section of the American 
Chemical Society on the danger of 
overspecialization. From this ad
dress we herewith give some ex
tracts. The full address may be 
found on pages 845 to 854, Vol. XV., 
No. 648 of Science.
Dr. Baekeland emphasized that we 
ought to consider all pursuits of life 
from a broad general standpoint. 
Even now, our educational system is 
still much under the chilling effect 
of that cloud, which, during the Mid
dle Ages, hid the light of true knowl
edge. A tendency has manifested 
itself to reform this antiquated sys
tem of education, but this tendency 
now seriously threatens us with the 
pitfalls of the other extreme.
Furthermore, the fact that scien
tific learning has found unceasing 
applications in the production of 
wealth has fostered the constantly 
increasing tendency for finding a 
scientific education or scientific pur
suits a mere means of earning a liv
ing or making money. * * * But 
such men once having decided to
enter a scientific profession, soon be
came aware that the call is for spec
ialists, and they were forced to spec
ialize one thing or another by their 
employers, whether the latter were 
manufacturers, merchants, or even 
some educational institutions whom 
they served as teachers.
What is worse, our own way of 
living shows beyond doubt that we 
all have undergone, more or less, the 
effects of overspecialization against 
which I have come to protest.
Busily burrowing along like moles, 
in the pursuit of our own little spec
ialties, we are dizzily preoccupied 
with our specialized routine work. 
We lose the desire of coming once 
in a while upon the surfaece of the 
earth to take a stimulating look at 
the grand view of nature and its in
spiring entity. Once, upon a while, 
are rather disturbed in our narrow 
scientific beliefs iwhen some Curie 
announces radium or radioactivity, 
or when some Ramsey upsets our 
orthodoxy by pronouncing the words: 
evolution of elements. We get 
fairly shocked when a Crookes speaks 
of death of matter.
Just in the same way, after admit
ting as holy faith that weight and 
matter are constant or indestructible, 
some day, somebody may have to 
rouse the most timid of us and force 
us into the belief that gravitation, 
like all other energies, can be modi
fied into any of them, or better per
haps, that gravitation, being the 
more stable of all energies, is the 
final energy toward which light, heat 
and electricity tend to change. Who 
knows but that ultimately a less 
neglected study of gravitation may 
allow us a glimpse into the secret of 
the destiny of our universe?
I admit, many of you will smile 
at these unorthodox hypotheses or 
conjectures. Yet, let me ask you: 
With what methods have we thus far 
measured any possible changes in 
weight? We have pinned all our 
faith, all our beliefs, on a mechanical 
instrument called a balance. A very 
delicate method indeed, if judged 
from our fconceited one-sided stand
point of specialists. We are proud 
if we possessess a balance which can 
weigh a one-hundredth of one milli
gram; we work ourselves into awe 
and admiration before an instrument 
such as the one I saw two years ago, 
which can detect a difference of a 
thousandth of a milligram. A one 
thousandth of a milligram! How infinitesimally small such a weight ap
pears to our limited conceptions; 
and yet, what a ponderous quantity 
this same weight becomes if we try 
to compare it with the mass of an 
electron.
Our whole science of chemistry is 
based on the fundamental law of the 
conservation of matter as formulated 
by Lavoisier and accepted by us as 
an axiom. However, by what means 
has this law been verified, if not by 
balances more crude, more imper
fect, than the clumsy instrument 
which can not weigh anything beyond 
1-1,000 of a milligram? It is high 
time that science should discover a 
more delicate means for determining 
small weights than a mere mechanical 
balance; then, but only then, may we 
be able to demonstrate beyond doubt 
whether all the assumptions o nwhich 
we base our chemistry are correct, or 
whether we simply have been build
ing a whole science on false prem
ises.
While we are at this subject, let 
us continue this act of self-examination. When we speak of the descrip
tive part of the science of chemistry, 
when we describe any reactions, any 
compounds, any laws, we all refer 
these to phenomena which take place 
.within an abnormally small range of 
temperature. Lately, Dewar opened

THE TARTAN
our eyes to some unexpected phe
nomena which occur at very low tem
peratures; on the other hand, the 
electric furnace so ably manipulated 
by our regretted Moissan enabled 
him to establish many unsuspected 
facts at temperatures which our im
perfect thermometric methods do not 
allow us to measure accurately. Yet, 
if we will drop for a moment our one
sided considerations and look upon 
everything in true proportions, we 
must admit that the range of temper
atures within which we have studied 
natural phenomena is disappointingly 
small, as compared with the possible 
range Of temperature of the universe.
Not so long ago, chemists had no 
better definition for organic com
pounds than to designate them as 
those that were produced under the 
intervention of vital forces; inor
ganic bodies, on the contrary, were 
supposed to be made under the in
fluence of ordinary physical forces. 
We all know since, how Liebig and 
Wohler disposed of this mistake by 
the memorable discovery of the syn
thesis of ura from inorganic bodies. 
Nevertheless, many of us to-day are 
prone to think that the more deli
cate organic bodies, as for instance, 
the constituents of the protoplasm, 
will never be obtained synthetically. 
These doubters point to the fact that 
as soon as we try to imitate these 
subtle, synthetic reactions which 
take place in the living cell we re
main powerless to accomplish any 
thing beyond splitting or simplifying 
the molecule. And yet, let me ask 
you, what are the laboratory methods 
with which we try to imitate the sub 
tie biological processes? Heating 
boiling, distilling, desiccation, pre 
cipitation, electric currents, every one 
of these barbariously destructive 
methods, with which we blast away 
at exceedingly delicate compounds: 
we might just as well try to imitate 
the melodious music of a Gounod by 
firing some dynamite cartridges be
tween the delicate string of a piano.
One sided as we are, we witness 
every day of our lives the fact that 
all vegetation accomplishes its pro
cesses of synthesis or assimilation 
under the indispensable action of 
light; nevertheless, thus far we have 
tried very little to avail oureslves of 
this powerful, yet delicate source of
synthetic energy. Up till now pho
tochemistry has scarcely been used 
for any other purposes but the art 
of photography.

Technical Education.
We have long held to the theorem 
that the advance in applied science
has been the great factor in the ma
terial progress of the past 50 years, 
as the science itself has made in
roads on, and upset theological and 
philosophical thought. The great 
advance of Germany in commerce 
and industry has been a steady and 
persistent application of the princi
ples of physical and chemical sci
ence to increasing the efficiency of 
industrial processes. This is seen in 
the gamut of the little hand-sewing 
machine used by the Hindoo maid to 
the great steel rolling mills of Pitts
burg. It is the intelligent applica
tion of the methods and principles 
of science that have enabled the 
complicated organism of modern so
ciety to have its rapid growth in 
multifarious directions. Germany has 
also been the leader- in systematizing 
the methods for giving the youth the 
requisite training in the principles of 
science and the methods of engineer
ing. We Americans cannot but give 
due tribute to our Teutonic cousins 
for this pioneer work. The Technische Hochschulen and the Reichsanstalt are concrete evidences of it.

A New Ore Handling Plant at 
Cle'. eland.
The American Steel and Wire Com
pany at its Central Works, Cleveland, 
Ohio, is constructing a new ore un
loading plant, to be operated by elec
tricity and designed to give rapid dis
patch to boats. This plant will be 
operated in connection with the ex
isting plant, which has a large num
ber of unloading bridges and gravity 
bucket machines. The new plant, 
however, will consist of two Hulett 
automatic unloaders of 10 tons ca
pacity, very similar in construction 
to those being installed at the new 
Gary plant. They will be equipped 
with weighing hoppers for weighing 
ore into railroad cars for shipment. 
It is estimated that these machines 
will handle at least 1,000,000 tons a 
year, and they will not only unload 
ore for the Central Furnace stock 
piles, but they are located convenient
ly for loading ore into cars to be 
[ sent to the American Steel and Wire 
furnaces in Newburg, four miles dislant.
In connection with the unloading 
plant there will be a stocking and 
rehandling bridge. This latter will 
also be of the Hulett pattern, con
structed by the Wellman-Seaver-Morgan Company, Cleveland, and will in
corporate all the improvements which 
have been made in ore bridges within 
the last few years. The bridge will 
be 238 feet span, 90 feet cantilever 
extension. It will be supported on an 
inverted A frame over a shear leg on 
the tower. The span of the bridge 
will cover the stock yard, and the can
tilever will reach out over the un
loaders and railroad tracks for ship
ping. Ore that goes into stock will 
be dumped on a temporary pile at 
the rear, from which it will be rehan
dled into a large stock pile by the 
bridge. The bridge is built high 
enough so that it will pass over the 
unloading machines. The bucket will 
be carried on the bridge on a trolley, 
which has all the hoisting and cross 
travel equipment self-contained. It 
is expected that the bridge will take 
care of all the stocking and rehandling 
for the two unloaders, being designed 
for high speed operation.

All of the baseball team of last sea
son at Dartmouth have been forbid
den to play football this fall, because 
of a charge of professionalism brought 
against them for summer baseball 
playing.
During the summer the Massa
chusetts Institute of Technology has 
purchased from the Westinghouse! 
Company a 503 kilowatt Parsons tur
bine with generator shaft and bear
ings. It is to run in connection with 
the large super-heater purchased last 
spring, steam being furnished at 200 
pounds pressure and 150 degrees of 
superheat.
At present the institute is not able 
to obtain the generator, so that a 
large water brake has been supplied, 
enabling careful experiments in effi
ciency to be made.
O. S. U. has reorganized its Drama
tic Club.
The Board of Student representa
tives of Columbia University has de
cided that hereafter all class elections 
will be supervised by two or three of 
its members who will be present to 
manage the election and count the bal
lots.
Three sophmores suspended for kid
napping freshmen have been rein

State University.
Quite a novel idea is being put in 
force by Professor Foulk, of the Chem
istry Department at Ohio State. A 
system of fines has been inaugurated 
for all offenses in the laboratory.
Rule 1. Poisonous fumes in the 
laboratory are not permitted. Fine, 
5 cents.
Rule 2. Apparatus must be cleaned 
often and carefully handled. Fine, 
5 cents. .
Rule 3. Water, gas and current 
must be carefully used. Fine, 5 cents.
Rule 4. Great precaution should be 
taken of fire. Fine, 10 cents.
Rule 5. All students should quit 
work at 4:30 oclock. Fine, 5 cents.
If the student continues in the habit 
of carelessness, the fines are increas
ed to 25 cents. It is hoped that none 
will be levied, and so far the records 
of the students are clear.

16THE T ARTAN
Civil Engineering Society.
The Civil Engineering Society held 
its first regular meeting of the year 
Saturday evening, October 20th, in 
their department at the school build
ings.
President Tingley set the wheels in 
motion by giving a brief sketch of 
the Societys history and future pros
pects.
Election of officers was then in or
der, and the following men were 
chosen unanimously to fill the re
spective offices:
G. H. WestbrookPresident, Sr.
G. W. Ketter, Vice President, Jr.
L. E. Exline, Secretary, Jr.
G. Halferty, Treasurer, Sr.
The newly elected officers were 
then requested to take charge of the 
meeting, and upon motion a vote of 
thanks was extended to the retiring 
officers for services rendered the So
ciety. Different members were then 
called up to address the meeting.
Prof. Thayer, in behalf of the fac
ulty and Senior members, welcomed 
the Junior Civil Engineering students 
into the Society. He said much de
pended on the new members and ask
ed for their hearty support in all 
the work of the organization.
Mr. Ketter, in behalf 01 the Junior 
members, spoke on the need of such 
a society, and assured the Senior 
members of the hearty co-operation 
of all the Junior members.
Prof. Foss next entertained the so
ciety by a brief talk on the impor
tance of studying your fellow men. 
Students should not only study their 
books, but their fellow students and 
instructors as well. One great de
fect in many engineers of to-day is 
their inability to deal with other men. 
Therefore it is necessary for us to 
learn to respect the feelings and 
rights of others.
Mr. Applegate, in his usual inter
esting manner, entertained the mem
bers with an illustrated lecture on 
the Quebec Bridge. With the aid of 
the illustrations he was enabled to 
give a fair idea of the immense size 
of the structure and the probable 
cause of the recent disaster.
Mr. Reed was next called upon, 
and taking advantage of the good hu
mor of those present, proceeded to 
inform the Juniors that plumb bobs
were not intended for making holes 
in the ground, and it is not a good 
practice where accuracy is desired 
to take measurements from these 
holes, which range from one to three 
inches in diameter.
Mr. Exline gave a brief outline of 
the Maintenance of Way department 
organization as found in most large 
railway systems, and spoke of the 
line of formation in that department 
which furnishes employment for a 
large number of Civil Engineers.
As the hour was growing late the 
society adjourned to the eating room, 
where Mr. Sharp had prepared a 
bountiful lunch, which was enjoyed 
by all and was considered a very ap
propriate close to the evenings pro
ceedings.
The C. E. members can justly feel 
proud of their organization. Its 
numbers have now increased to about 
fifty. Each member is called upon 
to sign a pledge of , good fellowship, 
which is for the advancement of his 
fellow members, and it is the inten
tion of the society that graduates of 
the Civil course use these names 
when out in practice. In this way 
t-e society will not only prove bene
ficial to the student, but will aid the 
school in securing positions for their 
graduates or any member who may 
be in need of such assistance.
DRAWING OF COPPER WIRE.
The drawing of copper wire appears 
to increase both the tensile strength 
and elasticity. The latter effect is 
almost nullified by subsequent an
nealing, and the former partially. To 
some extent the action seems to be 
superficial, as the effect is less on a 
large wire than on a small one. It 
is customary to draw each size of 
wire to an extent to give ample 
strength for its intended purpose, 
without increasing the cost of the 
thicker sizes beyond that warranted 
by the slight increase in strength ob
tained. Thus, %-inch wires show an ul
timate breaking strength of some 221/z 
tons per square inch; while smaller 
sizes, with only 80 circular mils, show 
as much as 80 tons. The elastic limit 
follows the breaking stress in a fairly 
constant ratio, being found at 21 tons 
on the smaller wire, as compared with
17 tons on the larger.
