VOL. II, No. 25 PITTSBURG, PA., WEDNESDAY, MARCH 18, 1908 TENCENTS
DR. HAMERSCHLAG RETURNS.
Doctor Hamerschlag has returned to his duties 
again after the first rest of any length he has taken 
since the organization of the schools. While his 
visit to Europe was primarily one of pleasure, the 
Director with his characteristic energy turned it 
almost entirely to one of observation. He visited 
the prominent institutions of learning in England, 
Wales, Scotland, France, Belgium and Germany, and 
yet he was away from his desk in Pittsburg, but the 
surprising short time of six weeks.
He arrived home on Tuesday evening, March 
10th, and first came to the schools on Thursday 
morning. His arrival was the occasion of a tremend
ous outburst of applause from the students, and en
thusiasm ran high all day, in fact it became a day 
for holiday-making. He addressed the day-students 
early Thursday morning and soon after the close of 
his address he was escorted outside to his carriage 
to which had been attached a long rope and nearly 
every Tech man shared in hauling the carriage out 
through Schenley Park to M. M. C. S., where another 
ovation was given the returning Director.
Mr. Leete, who had been forced by the students 
to accompany Dr. Hamerschlag on his ride, surrend
ered his seat in the carriage to Miss Smith, who was 
given a long Carnegie and the assembly moved 
down Woodlawn avenue to Forbes street to the 
Directors residence. Mrs. Hamerschlag was called 
for in ringing cheers and soon appeared and was es
corted to a seat in the carriage. Again the students 
took up their march down Forbes street to Fattys 
foot-path and across this and back to school again.
We print herewith Dr. Hamerschlags Thursday 
morning address:
Good morning. This is the kind of an ovation 
they usually give to heroes. My only heroism has 
consisted in keeping my stomach in order.
I am delighted to be here and I am delighted 
that my return is marked with sunshine. They say 
a great deal about Pittsburgh smoke, and fog, but if 
you ever lived in England during the winter you 
would know something about smoke and fog. I 
thought I would say something about the sunshine 
the very first thing because I want you to feel that
I am coming back here with a spirit of contentedness.
I never thought it possible that I could go away for a 
month or so and come back with a feeling of. con
tentment, so glad to be with my own again, my own 
lads, my own country, my own people. It is a great 
big thrill that I want you fellows to feel sometime 
it is worth living for, it is worth fighting for.
I havent got a great deal to say to you this 
morning; I would prefer to see you each personally 
sometime during the next week or monthto see 
you in my own home or my office, to shake hands 
and say a few words to you. Things have occurred 
since I have been away; three or four men have 
done a great deal which most likely I could not hav^ 
done to help you.
Certain of your social relationships are begin
ning to evolve themselves, in my judgment, satis
factorily, because intelligently handled. That is a 
great step forward. In addition to that there has 
been a movement forward educationally, a crystal
lization of a curriculum and a determination of what 
constitutes a course. It is a fact that they are 
practically prepared to put it on paper and into'a 
catalogue. It is literally the first intelligent statement 
that we are ready to give of what we have to do and 
what we have done. Our other catalogues were merely 
prospective statements that were so ambiguous that even 
our own faculty had a hard time knowing what we were 
trying to do.

---------------------------------------------------

4THE TARTAN
There is a new era dawning and I am glad to 
say it has been put through almost entirely by means 
of the faculty and student organizations.
I visited a great many institutions, not all of 
them technical ones. In fact, I was drawn toward 
the arts and music; I rather think I went to more 
of those than I did to the technological ones, and 
during the entire trip I was impressed with the fact 
that the institutions which were growing in power 
and importance did so for one reason only and that was 
that they were the instrument of the community, 
and had a clear and definite recognition of the ulti
mate place the individual student was to occupy 
alter graduation. Positions not provided by the gov
ernment are in the hands of the industries and the 
employers, and it is very essential indeed^ that the 
student be trained in details, because a man has 
got to go from the lowest ranks by gradual steps 
through fixed positions, and he must have age and 
experience in order to rise. He has not the power 
nor opportunity in Europe if he is an engineer that 
he has in America; he is told what to do: The indi
vidual who is told what to do requires a different 
kind of training than the man who is going to do 
without being told.
The average age of this student body equals the 
average in most of the schools that I have visited.
I think if I had a microscope so that I could look 
into the hearts of you boys I would find 90 per cent, 
of you men dont want to be anybodys workman, 
but you want, to be boss. Now you have this spirit 
largely developed, and desire to do things and not 
have people tell you to do them. You do a great 
many things as a student body which I think you will 
laugh at when you grow older; nevertheless you 
have that faculty of doing things; let us make the 
most of it and use this quality in its most effective form 
in your training. 
Whereas I have no specific thing to change I 
have come to the conclusion that we have a good 
many lessons to learn from Europe, yet we have cer
tain inherent qualities in you students, we have a 
certain flexibility in the relation between students 
and teachers that they cannot get.
I wanted you to have a hasty and general pic
ture of foreign students, they are not as well leveloped physically; except in one school, and that 
was largely due to the fact that that particular stu
dent body play cricket and tennis and foot-ball, and 
row and swim, and love the outdoor sports. I can
not say the same of German or French students, be
cause there, things of that kind are not established as 
traditions. A student in this institution has a better 
opportunity for general culture, that is, when speak
ing in reference to things non-technical,a greater 
opportunity to get a broader education in spite of the 
fact that we are a school of specialization. Take 
hold of the catalogue of any of these institutions, 
the technical high school or Hochschulethe Ecole 
de Minthe School of Minesor the School of 
Electricityconcentration and analysis are the sole
objectives, and that is the reason I claim that you 
have a better opportunity. It is a rare thing in 
Europe to find a student of a technical institution 
who has the creative instincts as well developed as 
our own students. Continental European students 
have a great deal of academic liberty which means 
that they may have freedom from drill and lose the 
close-knit institutional spirit that we try to cultivate.
Without being egotistical or conceited, without 
feeling that we are making a statement that we can
not substantiate, I am convinced that we have made 
relatively strong advancement over the European 
technical education, and I predict that another gener
ation will find the American Engineer in full posses
sion of leadership because of his imagination, because 
of his training and his education, he will take the posi
tion of leadership away from any individual training 
of an institution, with the rare exception of a genius, 
who will rise in spite of restrictive education.
It is fine to be an Americanto be able to say 
it. I can see a lot of crudeness of our American 
Life much more clearly than perhaps other people 
who are not so sensitive to it, but I have unbounded 
faith in the underlying principles of living and being 
which are fundamental to our national character.
I want to say to you boys, go out in this spring-like 
weather, begin to live, work and play, and go out 
and join in the things which go to make up this 
school; you are not many, but you are enough to knit 
together a spirit here that will live and go down to 
the next generations of students who are to people 
these halls.

PLEBES 
Within the past few days several of the members 
of the class have made a suggestion in regard to the 
track team that deserves more than passing notice. 
A track team from each class to hold inter-class 
meets is the idea, the object being to stimulate ath
letics in general, but being particularly adopted to 
secure material for the Varsity team in a manner 
no other method could do. Issuing a general call for 
candidates for the Varsity track team brings out the 
men who have done that sort of thing in High and 
Prep Schools, but is not calculated to develop B?e 
material. A class team of the sort offers the man 
who may be a natural adept in one line or other a 
chance to show what he can do. One who has had 
no, .or very little previous experience, is apt to say, 
Whats the use of my going out for the Varsity 
team? They want men who have shown what they 
can do. Ari it is perfectly natural. The whole 
scheme is calculated with a double purpose: to pro
vide the inter-class meets for the interest they them
selves can provide, and to make it possible to reach 
the very best material of Tech for the Varsity team.
While we are glad to see the enterprise dis
played by some of the students in selling picture 
postals of recent events, we beg to remind them that 
no one has the slightest objection to paying a fair 
price for the same, but it does seem that the present 
one is exorbitantly high.
A mock trial will be given by members of the 
Plebe class under the direction of the Department 
of English. Messrs. Poste, McIntyre, Borschneck 
and Naismith will act as attorneys. The event will 
take place on Friday, March 20, in the Assembly 
Hall, the admission being 15 cents, and the proceeds 
to be turned over to athletics.
Prof. JamesWith a hydrometer you can tell 
if youre half charged or how you are. Later he 
had a violent collision with some glass jars on the 
floor. Turning quickly and looking at the remains, 
he hurriedly said, Oh, I b?g your pardon.

Dioxygen looking for an affinity?

Some one asked McKorkle how often the paper 
he receives from Texas is published. He replied: 
No, they publish it tri-weekly. That is twice a
week, and then they try again.
Pat Coles and Naismith seemed in their ele
ment on Tuesday. Wonder why?

Never was a day so thoroughly enjoyed as 
Thursday, the day of The Directors arrival in the 
city. Excitement from morning until late in the 
afternoon, dancing enough to satisfy every one. And 
last, but not least, the refreshments.
We have many times looked back upon the fine 
barbecue with which the boys entertained us, in 
early September, but nothing can excel this last 
event. Leap year customs prevailed and the young 
ladies asked the young men to dance. We are sorry 
that there were some who did not join in the dancing 
and hope that before next time they will get up cour
age enough to learn the art. The Barn dance was 
one of the most attractive features of the entire af
fair. It is becoming very popular with the girls and 
we are glad to see that quite a few of the boys know 
it.
We wish to thank Miss Smith and the Director 
for the enjoyable time which they permitted us to 
have and perhaps some time they may consent to 
have a repetition of it.
The A division of the class of 1910 gave a luncheon 
party Thursday, March 12. The members of the di
vision and a boy friend of each were present.
We are sure that all present had a good time 
and enough to eat, although Poor Silver did miss 
the ice cream part of it.
The division wishes to express regret that the 
rest of the schools could not be present and hope to 
entertain them some time in the future.
The Junior class has decided upon May 15th as 
the date for their Prom. The following committee 
were selected: The Misses Alcorn, Gibbs, Pfeil,
Johns, Sawhill, Herron, and Connell.
On Thursday the M. M. C. S. received the sur
prise of its existence, when the boys made their un
ceremonious entrance.
Excitement ran high when they reached the 
Gym. and took possession, and every one was wonder
ing what would happen next when the assembly bell 
rang.
In spite of the music in the Gym. and the possi
bility of exciting happenings, every girl turned eager
ly toward the first floor to greet the Director.
His talk was very interesting and served to show 
us that the American girl student has many advan
tages. Certainly every girl present was thankful 
to be in a country where she need be none the less 
womanly because she is a student.

The attitude of the American girl abroad as 
student of Art, or Music, was not a pleasing picture, 
and one could but be filled with pity for the girls 
who sacrifice any womanly qualities for such a doubt
ful reward.
The descx-iption of the one class in Gymnastics 
in the London Normal School, should make us doubly 
appreciative of our own Gym. and our excellent in
structor.
It is a pleasing thought to the lovers of the Tar
tan that the finest schools are to be found in Scot
land. The news brought us from other schools for 
women should make us thankful that we are part of 
a new school which aims to bring out, not only 
natural ability, but every manly and womanly qual
ity, and in this way make the home the dearest 
spot on earth. We were also told that in European 
schools the professors and heads of schools do not 
come into close touch with the students.
This information coming from a man whose re
turn was hailed as an occasion for rejoicing, pre
sented a decided contrast.
Though the boys entered our building in an un
conventional manner, the dance which followed 
proved that the unconventional is not always un
pleasant. Probably such an affair never took place 
before and the manner in which it was carried out 
was certainly gratifying. The dance was pleasant 
and the students of both schools were surely benefitted by the meeting.
since Thursday we feel that the yellow of the 
Tartan is greatly improved by the manly background 
of the red, blue and green.

On Friday evening, March 13th, the night stud
ents celebrated Director Hamerschlags return in 
what the most exacting would declare a fitting man
ner. The school as a whole assembled in the lecture 
room, and, by a prearranged plan, broke into a long 
Carnegie yell as the Director appeared on the scene. 
The address was a Hamerschlag characteristic as 
to rhetoric and delivery, but it was the subject which 
brought out the great overflow of enthusiasm. The 
remarks in the opinion of the writer, were confined 
chiefly to a comparison of Tech with technical 
institutions of the Old World and the result is quite 
favorable to us.
Prior to the appearance of the Director plans for 
a monster celebration were laid and immediately 
after the address the students primed six abreast 
and about three hundred strong and marched over to 
the M. M. C. S. yelling and singing as only really 
enthusiastic students can. Upon arrival at the desti
nation the doors were found locked but the windows 
were not, as the latter were used as a means of en
trance. Swarming through the windows and making 
their way at once to the gymnasium, the self-invited throng proceeded at once to remove overcoats 
and make themselves at home.
A committee waited upon the assistant principal, 
and, after apologizing for the intrusion, begged that 
the girls be turned loose in the gym as they (the 
boys) were eager to have a dance to celebrate the 
Directors return. iSo eloquent were the committee 
that ere long the girls came up (timidly) and then 
began one the finest affairs imaginable. It was de
lightfully informal, and the spirit of good fellowship 
was predominant in all the participants. The boys 
are particularly indebted to the faculty of the M. M.
C. S. for dispensing with classes and also for volun
teering their services as an introduction committee. 
Mr. Weidlein is to be included in the vote of thanks 
for the kindness he showed in keeping the lights on 
after hours. Mr. Schaedle and Mr. Stamm were am
ply repaid for their stunts at the piano by the ap
plause they received. The others who played are 
hereby thanked and it is with regret that the writer 
confesses ignorance as to their identities.
These were several amusing features in the 
evenings entertainment, the chief of which was the 
creaking of the joints of some of the angry mob who 
tried to dance. The noise was really a menace to 
sport as the offending gentlemen, instead of limbreing up creaked the more. Mr. Weidlein started an 
investigation thinking perhaps some part of the 
building was about to give away, butwhat do you 
think he found it to be?
Merely some of the prehistoric specimens of 
humanity listed in the catalogue as the Class of 
1910, who tried to cut up as they used to do in 
their first childhood.

When a person dives into psychology one of the 
first things he learns is that words and sentences 
produce sensations, mental images, that are exactly 
the same as though the objects named in the sen
tences were perceptible. When the ionic theory is 
mentioned to one who has been initiated into its 
mysteries; what is the sensation produced on his 
mind? Oh! Pshaw! Its too easy, isnt it? The only 
thing he can see is a picture, cabinet size, of Dr. Sill 
in his daily lecture. And at this point, while we 
are speaking of the mind and its processes we might 
add that our victim belongs to the Peripatetic 
School of Philosophies. Such an ardent devotee is 
he to tnis School of Philosophy that it is estimated 
that since he has commenced his lecture course he 
has covered distances that rival, if not eclipse, any 
performance of Champion Weston. His name is not 
unknown to fame in other branches of athletics, 
for did he not njake his F on the Faculty base-ball 
team?
Dr. Sill was a member of the charter faculty of 
the Tech schools. He graduated at Princeton Uni
versity and studied at Leipsig, receiving his doctors 
degree at that university, and for some time prior 
to his coming to Tech he was research chemist at 
the Carnegie Institution, Washington, D. C. While 
at Old Nassau he took a prominent part in athletics, 
being a star track and base-ball man, winning his 
letter in both of these branches. We have no posi
tive proof that he introduced the Dissociation theory 
into his athletics, but the manner in which he dis
sociated himself from his mitt in catching fouls dur
ing the faculty game last spring would lead me to 
suspect such wras the case. He can make the Dis
sociation Theory or the Law of Mass Action fit any 
exigency, even to the effect produced in the result
ant product by lowering the concentration of brown 
sugar in fudge.

We print in another column a communication 
from Professor James regarding the fence that served 
as an excuse for two or three abortive class fights 
in the not distant past. As Professor James has saidthe experiments being carried on are of great inter
est to the faculties of the various institutions on 
whose grounds they are located, and they should be 
of some interest to the students aside from the fact 
that they furnish a good back-ground for the artistic 
efforts of embryonic sign painters. The student body 
should learn to discriminate between what consti
tutes legitimate channels for the expression of class' 
spirit and matters where the preservation of peace 
should not only be desirable, but also a matter of 
school pride. This series of tests, while not carried 
on on such an extensive scale as is the fuel testing 
in the Government Laboratory, is important in that 
it is the forerunner of many more tests of commercial 
products. The fence is now being covered with 
panels painted in various .colors. While these panels 
seem to follow the colors of the Carnegie Plaid as 
named in Alma Mater, The Tartan is able to state 
authoritively that blue will not appear on the board 
for some time to come. The different colors now 
under test will be allowed stand subject to weather 
conditions for a long enough period to enable the 
Manufacturers Association to determine the effect 
of different proportions of the various ingredients 
on the durability of the paint. We feel that the ma
jority of the students participating in the last few 
dashes were ignorant of the purpose for which the 
fence was erected, and such being the case, that 
these few words of explanation will be sufficient and 
that in the future we will, when seeking for new ways 
of amusing ourselves, confine ourselves to walking 
on the grass, train-wrecking, or some other innocent 
form of amusement.

Editor-in-Chief The Tartan:
Sir: After reading your editorial headed By the
Way, I am led to pen these few lines in defense of 
the Journeymen Department of the Trade Schools: 
The Journeymen Department has always felt the 
most cordial and harmonious relation with the other 
departments of the schools and attribute the now gen
eral dissatisfaction to th Thistle incident only and 
not to the cause you have stated. This is the first 
and only time we have felt that we have not been 
given a square deal.
Yours respectfully,
A Journeyman Student.

Last week some of the Plebes conceived the idea 
of painting their numerals upon the big sign board 
in the rear of M. M. C. S. This in itself was all 
right, and as they only occupied half of the board 
and looked rather lonesome, some of our fellows si
lently climbed the hill on Wednesday night and in 
striking green colors balanced the other end with 
a large INDUSTRIALS, 09. Having finished this 
they decided that the green was too dark to show 
up well against the red background and immediately 
went to Oakland for some white paint to shade the 
letters with, but upon returning were chagrined to 
find that their previous work had been completely 
eradicatedevidently by the Plebes. Again the 
painting was gone over in white and again it was 
smeared out by our friends from Woodlawn and 
Techmont. Insults of this kind call for any bold 
action at all, and so, while all of the Plebes were 
engaged in the big parade Thursday a delegation 
from the Industrials completely wiped out the 1910 
and replaced it with an IND09, in full view of the 
hundreds of Plebes in the parade. For a third time 
our sign wa*s ruined in our absence, so at an im
promptu meeting it was decided to repaint the sign 
and protect it by force. A large band of all the 
game men in our school then donned their uniforms 
of war and like true soldiers charged on the Plebes 
occupying the contested property. Likewise the 
Plebes, who seemed to be enjoying themselves 
around M. M. C. S.s, charged upon the ground and, 
reaching it at about the same time as our men, the 
result may be almost as easily imagined as de
scribed. Small things such as fists were, for the 
time being, dispensed with and everything of a war
like liature available was pressed into service. For 
several minutes the fray waxed fast and furious, and 
but for the timely arrival of Henderson, there could 
have been no dnd until one side had gained a dearly 
paid for victory.
Quoting Henderson: For &?Lv?Bd8 sake, fel
lows, if you want to fight go over on the campus. 
If this proceeds here it will only end in the sudden 
death of a dozen of you.
The Plebes at this juncture awoke from the 
delusion that they were invincible and were heard 
to loudly disclaim any intention or desire to have 
it out on the campus. The Industrials, still calm 
and self-possessed, were quick to realize the value 
of "Scotty Number Ones advice, and withdrew, 
clearly the victors, to the campus, to which place the 
Plebes did not follow.
Last Wednesday morning, owing to the illness 
of Mr. Dosey, the Draftsmen were excused for the

week how much noise a gang of Plebes can make 
having a little fun, they decided to experiment and 
see just how much fun they could have while at the 
same time eliminating all of the noisy and ungentlemanly features. A lock-step was formed and a 
general review of Oakland, Schenley Park and the 
Tech School property was begun. This was carried 
out perfectly to the enjoyment of all witnesses and 
the annoyance of none. As usual M. M. C. S. was 
made the center of attraction, and after an inter

was swift and sweet. Some of the girls having a 
camera handy took a picture of the parade, and

The Physics Department has recently perfected 
a device for class-room demonstration of the Koenig 
Manometric flame. Heretofore the reflection of the 
flame has been examined in a revolving mirror, but 
owing to the smallness and dimness of the flame 
as well as to the air disturbances caused by the ro
tating mirror, the method is unsatisfactory except 
for laboratory research.
The new device consists of a series of lenses 
which revolve about the flame as a center and pro
ject successively the image of the flame on a screen. 
The flame is larger than usual and is supplied with 
acetylent instead of common gas. It is protected 
from drafts by the mounting of the lenses. The 
brightness and sensitiveness of the acetylene flame 
makes it possible, with this apparatus, to .show its 
movements to a large audience.

Last Friday evening the night men were treated 
to some surprisesvery pleasant ones, too; and we 
are all wishing more of the same kind would be 
given us."
Director Hamerschlag gave us a short address 
which we were all glad to hear. We believe that if 
our Director only realized how much encouragement 
he gives and how much ambition can inspire with an 
address of his, he would make his talks to the night 
men more frequent.

While scientific research has benefitted most of 
the manufacturing lines in our modern industiial 
life, there are certain industries in which much of 
the work is fctill carried out according to rule of 
thumb methods. Our knowledge of the resisting 
properties of various paints when exposed to atmos
pheric influences is in something of a chaotic state, 
for the simple reason that no accurately conducted 
experiments have been made to determine the rela
tive- values of mixtures of linseed oil with the differ
ent basic materials and pigments, as applied to the 
protection of exposed surfaces.
Realizing that definite information on this point 
would be Ox: paramount value, to the buyer of paints, 
as well as to the manufacturer, the Paint Manufactur
ers Association of the United States has arranged 
to carry out an exhaustive series of experiments to 
determine the durability of various standard paints 
when all are exposed to the atmospheric influences 
of a given locality. This Association, representing 
an invested capital of two hundred and fifty million 
dollars, has appropriated one hundred thousand dol
lars for carrying out this investigation. Experiment
al fences are being built at the following points, in 
order to determine the resisting power of paints when, 
treated under widely differing climatic conditions: 
Atlantic City, N. J.; Ann Arbor, Mich.; St. Louis, 
Mo.; New Orleans, La.; Grand Forks, N. D. The 
Michigan experiment is being carried out under 
the supervision of a committee from the faculty of 
the University of Michigan, the North Dakota ex
periment is under the supervision of Dr. E. F. Ladd, 
of the Department of Chemistry, of the iState Univer
sity, and the Pittsburgh fence is located on the 
grounds of the Carnegie Technical Schools, under 
the supervision of a committee of the faculty, with 
the co-operation of Director Hamerschlag.
The committee of the Association has located 
these experimental fences on the grounds of promi
nent educational institutions, wherever possible, for 
two reasons: the first is that from a scientific stand
point these experiments are of the greatest interest 
to the professors and students of these institutions, 
and, second, the committee wished to have fences 
where they would be free, from disturbance of any 
kind. The students of the other institutions have not 
interfered in any way with the progress of these 
experiments. The North Dakota fence is located 
close to the university and the students have co
operated with the faculty in protecting the fence 
from injury of any kind.
We feel sure that with the above explanation all 
Tech students will support the committee of the 
faculty in protecting the Pittsburgh experimental 
fence, which is now being erected on our grounds.

Director Hamerschlag addressed the Night Stu
dents in the Assembly Hall last Friday evening, re
ceiving hearty and cordial greetings from the boys 
who crowded the hall to the doors. Those who were 
present were very fortunate in hearing the Director 
in one of his particularly delightful moods. His re
marks seemed to have more effect upon the stu
dents than any previous address, as they listened 
with profound silence and attention. His compari
son between the students of the institutions he vis
ited while abroad and those of America were very 
interesting as well as flattering to us. The stu
dents over there, he says, are all apparently fitting 
themselves for governmental positions; to work un
der the direction of some one else, while here 
every single student, almost without exception, is 
ambitious to be the boss himself and lead in hi's 
chosen vocation. At the conclusion of the address, 
the students adjourned to the M. M. C. S. Gymna
sium, where a very enjoyable evening was spent at 
dancing.

the main entrance hall regarding base-ball matters, 
which should be read by all interested. With a

THE TARTAN15

Late last year, a school dramatic club was 
termed under the name of the White Friars. It 
was begun too late to do anything, but aroused 
enough interest to make it apparent that such a 
club composed of Tech men will be able to hold its 
own and become one of the most prominent of school 
organizations. Any Tech man having dramatic abil
ity is eligible to membership. The club has a man
ager and an assistant manager, who have power to 
appoint committees, call meetings, and direct af
fairs, the idea being to have no written constitution 
for the present at least, in order to build up the most 
effective means of government by experience. The 
officers are Lowell W. Nicols, 10, Manager, and 
Walter Gray, 09, assistant manager.
It is hoped that an original production can be 
given in the future, but at present a light comedy 
will answer the purpose better than anything else. 
A committee for the purpose of selecting a play was 
appointed last wejek, and consists of Gray, 09; Mitch
ell, 10, and Horton, 10.
The Plebe class, before understanding the dra
matic situation, formed their Comedy Club, which 
was dissolved last week and the members taken into 
the WThite Friars. The Senior Dramatics is a class 
affair, and in no way conflicts with the other organ
ization. The plan is to give the play selected by 
ithe play committee here in Pittsburg after having 
made a trip of a week or so, playing in a number of 
towns and cities in this State and vicinity, at Com
mencement. The officers are determined to push 
the thing through, and make it an annual affair, 
worthy of Tech. The manager promises to keep 
the school informed of the progress by means of 
these columns, and asks the hearty co-operation of 
every member of the Carnegie Technical Schools.

The Day Students will shortly have a proposi
tion submitted to them regarding a change of sched
ule to take effect next term. The idea is to begin 
school at 8.30 A. M. and to shorten the lunch period 
to one-half hour, thus allowing school to be dismiss
ed at 3.00 P. M. This plan was brought up in order 
that Manager Colmery of the base-ball team could 
arrange games for Wednesday afternoons which he 
could not otherwise get. It is up to the students to 
decide whether they would care to undertake an ear
lier start than at present. The plan is a good 
one and would serve a two-fold purpose in that some 
night work could be gotten out of the way and also 
that the Seniors could get used to the early start 
which will be necessary when work is started this 
summer. The plan would be a good one for the ath
letes and could be applied to the fall term for the 
benefit of the foot-ball team as well.
