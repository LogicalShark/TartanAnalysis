PITTSBURG, PA., WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 26, 1910
ATHLETICS
SITUATION MUCH IMPROVED
Within the past week the Athletic situation has 
cleared considerably. Dr. Savage and Mr. Wood
ward completed their examination of the records of 
the Athletic Association and gave a summary of it 
to the Board of Control at their special meeting last 
Friday. There is no necessity of giving the details 
of it here; suffice it to say that in their opinion there 
is enough money on hand to go ahead with Track, 
and carry out all the arrangements and plans as 
originally laid out. There is not enough money to 
carry on baseball and football; therefore the mem
bers were requested to call meetings of their re
spective classes to decide which of the sports is to 
be dropped for the year. Dr. Savage does not think 
it wise to make the attempt to have both, when 
they see their way clear for only one. The money 
asked for a week or so ago will be devoted to the 
sport decided upon.
We learn at the last minute before going to press 
that the vote of the classes seems to indicate that 
football will be supported by the student body, and 
that in view of this, a subscription list has been 
started among the Faculty to guarantee baseball. 
With this much on foot, the remainder of the men 
who have not as yet paid their amount to aid the 
cause of football should certainly do so at once. For 
the first time since the first of October the outlook 
is a bright one. All that remains to be done is to 
finish the football collection.
ymoCK.
The Track Teams have a very good outlook before 
them. Dr. Savage has completed arrangements to 
have the preliminary try outs in the Exposition Rink 
from 4:30 to G in the afternoons. The official call 
for candidates will be posted on the bulletin boards 
within the next week, announcing the time and con
ditions of all trials. It is desired to get as many 
men out as possible for the team. Men for the 
weights are specially needed. It is to be desired that 
not only the men who have done track work before 
will come out, but those willing to try. Dr. Savage is 
now making arrangements to secure the best force 
of coaches who have ever had anything to do with 
a college team in this vicinity, and will have a 
specialist for each branch of the work.
It is certain that an inter-class meet will be held 
i-n connection with an invitation High and Prep. 
School meet, as soon as is practicable, and will pre
cede the larger meets of the season in which Tech 
will participate. In the near future Tech will en
deavor to give an intercollegiate meet, but not dur
ing the present season.
Much interest centers about the meet to be given 
by the Fort Pitt Athletic Club during the last week 
in February.
The Western Pennsylvania championship will be 
decided on April 9, and will include the high jump, 
hurdles, distance runs, etc.

abroad for almost three months. He will sail with 
Mrs. Hamerschlag on the North German Lloyd 
steamer Grosser Kurfurest from New York, on 
Feb. 5. After visiting Maderia and Spain he will 
touch Algeria and Italy, visiting all the technical 
schools and institutes along his route. In case there 
is time he will then make a trip across the conti
nent, visiting the Belgium School of Mines, the 
School of Beaux-Arts, and the School of Science, of 
Paris, and the University of Zurich, and many other 
institutions of learning and culture. April 1st, is the 
date set for his return.

Win 3r Contest With Charles and Hititner Out.
Tech's fast hockey seven again displayed the fact 
that they are past masters at playing the game. 
With two regular players missing from the line-up, 
(Charles and Hittner) the Tech seven outplayed their 
rivals from Pitt by the score of 3 to 1. In every de
partment of the game did Tech show her superior
ity. Her team work was of high order and she outskated the Pitt men from start to finish. Pitt could 
not keep the puck long enough to carry it the length 
of the ice to shoot, and as a result the playing was 
mostly in Pitts territory.
The first half was the most clean-cut hockey put 
up by any teams in the league this winter. It was 
fast and at the same time no penalties were given. 
Tech showed wonderful team work, which seemed 
all the better when contrasted to the rather sloppy 
work of the Pitt forwards. Tech scored twice in 
this half. Bright and Harmer doing the shooting.
The second half was not so clean cut in its work, 
and several penalties were handed out. Shortly after 
the half opened Tech scored again. Muller made 
Pitts only point shortly after. Then things began 
to get a little rough and Harmer was sent to the 
bench for the usual time. Lowe was hit on the head 
and knocked out for a few moments, but was able 
to resume playing. Shortly after Boyle and Lowe 
were put out for roughing it up. Then Muller drew 
a pass for a rest cure. The half ended before there 
was much chance for further roughing. The final 
score wras 3 to 1 in Techs favor.
The individual work of Lowe and Mason on the 
forward line were the bright spots. Dornberger did 
some notable work at cover point and broke up play 
after play before it could pass his station. Minnemeyer played his usual good game at goal. It was, 
however, the team work and not the work of indi
viduals that won the game for Tech.

On last Wednesday evening the fifth annual con
cert of the Glee and Mandolin Clubs was given in the 
Carnegie Music Hall. In its entirety the affair must 
be voted a decided success, and the 23 men repre
senting the Glee Club and the 17 the Mandolins are 
colectiveily the first to be mentioned.
The stage of the Music Hall was decorated with 
palms and tropical foilage, the gift of Mr. H. L. 
Blind. The first number was over twenty minutes 
behind schedule time in starting, and the large audi
ence, despite their tedious wait, gave the men a 
warm reception. Throughout the entire program 
there seemed to be a great improvement in the en
semble work of the Clubs over that heard last year, 
and with one exception the work was very credita
ble. The solos by Warrillow were quite up to the 
standard of those of previous years, and the quar
tette the best that has ever been heard. One of the 
greatest improvements noticed was a more superior 
tonal balance of the different parts, and perhaps 
more consistent drilling. No doubt the audience 
would have found more enjoyment in a program 
having less pure male chorus numbers on it, and a 
few more numbers of the type of Lucky Jim. 
After rendering a consistently good program up to 
the twelfth number, the Glee Club got on the rocks 
when they hit the third chord of The Sweetest 
Flower that Blows. For some ocult reason, the 
voices dropped a full half-tone below the piano ac
companiment and stayed there. It was apparently 
one of the unexplainable things liable to happen 
wThen least looked for.
The Mandolin Club in all its work made a far bet
ter showing than last year, having better balance 
and execution. The addition of the lutes this year 
had much to do with the improvement. It is to be 
regretted that there were no combined numbers of 
the Clubs.
The audience was a representative one, and seem
ingly enjoyed the program from start to finish. The 
Clubs will give a number of other concerts later in 
the season, and it is expected that the major part 
of the Glee Club will appear with the White 
Friars as the singing chorus.
Missouri University will send a fast four-mile re
lay team to the University of Pennsylvania games 
next spring. There is said to be in the University 
four men who can go the mile between 4.34 and 4.42.

Last week I just decided,
I would be a sporty cuss,
And would go to hear the concert 
And see the fellows Fuss.
The hall was decorated,
And the lamps were all agio.
There would more of us attended,
If wed only had the dough.
Soon the crowd began to gather,
(Bigger bunch there should have been) 
Dashing fellows, pretty girls,
And we watched them all come in.
Here and there a borrowed full dress, 
But the sacks were in the lead,
And the girls were dressed quite nifty,
All from care and trouble freed.
Hark! the concert now has opened,
And we hear the music ring,
Say, those fellows are some players,
And the Glee Club sure can sing.
Many things drew my attention 
To the center of tohe stage,
And Herr Lunt and his mustaches 
Were the fashionable rage.
Here a second P
There a Caruso the third,
And our Graduate Pianist
Was the best you ever heard.
Things went on till intermission,
When we had a Promenade.
Now and then an introduction,
New acquaintances were made.
Them we had some more fine music,
Not forgetting Lucky Jim.
Oh, that song was sure a leader 
And they sang it with a vim.
At the first verse there were chuckles, 
Second tears were in each eye.
But when dead Jim was called Lucky 
We all laughed enough to die.
Soon we had our own Amici,
With a good Carnegie cheer,
And the concert then was over 
So we started for a (Moxie).

We find upon thinking more deeply, that while we 
did tell the truth, there was perhaps a little more to 
say on the other side, last week when we suggested 
that it was up to the school authorities to notify the 
managers of student activities at least a month ahead, 
that Glee Club members were in bad standing and 
would not be allowed to participate in the concert. 
What we said was very much to the point, 
and we still hold to it; it is a dangerous
thing as far the finances of the organiza
tions are concerned to find it necessary about
a week before some important appearance to 
be forced to either appear with a crippled club or call 
it all off, and loose the money expended in advertis
ing and other things.
But now for the other side. Under the present 
arrangement, each student in the Carnegie Technical 
Schools is notified by letter of his standing in all 
branches with special emphasis laid upon the deficien
cies. These notices make their appearence monthly in 
most cases. It is therefore left to the individual to
go to the manager of his club or organization and
make known the likelihood of his not being able to 
participate in whatever form of activity his club en
gages in. The Glee and Mandolin episode made one 
thing very plain, and that was that the members declared in bad standing at the last minute were the 
ones to blame. They had been notified of the de
ficiencies, and we hope that it was wholly through 
oversight on their part that nothing was said to the 
management of the clubs at the time. As is the usual 
thing the innocent had to bear the entire brunt of 
the burden, which in our estimation, was a very re
grettable consequent.
In order to obviate the liability of such an occur
rence happening with the White Friars, the manage
ment has adopted a plan to keep posted on a mans 
standing. This shifts the responsibility to the man
ager. As far as the organization is concerned, it is 
a very good thing, but it is a pity, that the individual 
student after receiving his warning does not have 
sufficient regard for the welfare of his club to vol
untarily report to its manager the fact that he has 
come under the faculty ruling regarding scholarship.
aOomD OF COlymOL oyyElDolCE.
The Board of Control of the Athletic Association 
have been very seriously handicapped recently in 
their work, by the indifferent attendance of the mem
bers. Whether a meeting is called in the middle of 
the week or at the end; on a night when the Night 
Schools are in session or not, seems to make little 
difference. For some time past the secretary of that 
body has sent out postals announcing the meeting, 
and in other ways the information has been widely cir
culated. We think that the little amount of energy or 
exertion required to attend the meetings is so small, 
that at once the plea of burdensomeness can be elimi
nated from the possible excuses. Every class has a 
representative with a voice in the proceedings. When 
he cannot be present in person, it is his business to 
send in his vote by proxy, so that the Board can 
transact business. We feel that the class presidents 
should find out whether their men are on the job or 
not. If not, the classes owe it to themselves to fire 
them and get others in their places.

The attention of all the Night Draftsmen is called 
to the fact that the Draftsmens Club meets on 
Tuesday evening at 9:30 oclock.
An important subject will be taken up for con

earnestly requested to be present.
Come out, fellows. The Social Committee has 
been getting things in shape to hold that dance that 
we have been talking about all year, and which is 
scheduled to come off in the near future, and the 
suggestions and help of every member of the Club 
are needed to make it a success.

J. B. Hays, W. M. Johnson, Meredith Jones, L. A.

goat should have been loaded to his full capacity. 
It seems, however, that he was pretty well primed, 
for the initiates say he did his work in a very thor

repaired to the Collelli Cafe downtown and had a 
jollification, in which the new members were made 
to illustrate their experiences by means of stories. 
Altogether it was a jolly evening.
Last week the Senate called a meeting of the oc

As a result of the meeting a committee of three,

conduct of affairs therein.
One of our popular Juniors, Mr. Archie Lamont, 
surprised his friends and schoolmates lately by let
ting the fact leak out that he has been married since 
August 23. The story of the affair they tell runs 
something like this: On the above mentioned date, 
Archie announced his intention of attending a picnic 
in company with Miss Zella Smith. Instead of do
ing so he quietly stole away to the town of Fordyce 
and was married by Rev. Bolton, for whom he had 
served as best man several years before. The 
truth leaked out at last, and Archie traded his work 
here for that in an office downtown, which was the 
means of our getting wise. Well, heres hoping 
not for many happy returns of the daybut that his 
married life will be long, prosperous and happy.

There is a tension felt all over school just now, 
due to the fact that the Junior Prom is only a 
week off. When walking through the halls one 
comes upon groups of Juniors, and sometimes sen
iors, talking and gestulating excitedly over programs 
and gowns. Dean West is swamped with appoint
ments with committees, and the gymnasium is be
ing fairly overhauled and repairedor at least it 
seems so by the noise of hammering going on there. 
But sorrow has recently fallen upon these gay folks, 
for they have heard that the term marks will be 
sent out before the night of the Prom, and then 
well, many dances will be cancelled and a general 
wail will be heard.

An advertisement in a newspaper calling for a

the following answer:

business experience of 23 years being connected 
with the United States Embassy at Madagascar, and 
feel confident if you will give me a trial I can prove 
my worth to yoii. I am not only an expert book
keeper, proficient stenographer and typewriter, ex

have several other accomplishments which might 
make me desirable. I am an experienced snowshoveler, a first-class peanut roaster, have some 
knowledge of removing superfluous hair and clip
ping puppy dogs ears, have a medal for reciting 
Curfew Shall Not Ring Tonight, am a skilled chi
ropodist and practical farmer, can also cook, take 
care of horses, crease trousers, open oysters, and re
pair umbrellas. Being possessed of great physical 
beauty, I would not only be useful but ornamental as 
well, lending to the sacred precincts of your office 
that delightful artistic charm that a Satsuma vase 
or stuffed billy goat' would. As to salary, I would 
feel I was robbing the-widow and swiping the sponge 
cake from the orphan if I were to take advantage 
of your munificence by accepting the too fabulous 
sum of $3.00 per week, and I would be entirely will
ing to give you my services for less, and by accept
ing $1.37 per week would give you an opportunity 
of not only increasing your donation to the C'hurch, 
pay your butcher and keep up your life insurance, 
but also to found a home for indigent fly-paper sales
men and endow a free bed in the cat home.
When Dry Cleaning is done properly you cant 
help but be satisfied. See SHUMAN, at 3911 Forbes 
near Boquet. Give him a sample order.
You should see the fine..line of Cards, Valentines, 
etc., at Singers, 21G Oliver avenue.
Why use a badleaking pen? Singer Pen Store 
can fix you up sure.

human life, eight men being the victims. Most of 
the fraternity houses at Ithaca are situated upon a 
hill which is protected from fire by a single inefficient 
chemical apparatus. In the case of the recent fire 
in the Delta Upsilon fraternity house, a period of 
over an hour elapsed between the discovery of the 
fire and the time when the first effective stream was 
turned upon the flames.

yHE WonL OF yHE FCnElCE MEl.
(Profuse apologies to William Cullen Bryant.)
The melancholy days are come, the saddest of the 
year.
Deepest gloom, like Pittsburg smoke, hangs over 
the Tech School here,
Down in the bottom of each heart all earthly hope 
lies dead,
No more we hear the Sophomores laugh, the Fresh
men softly tread.
The Juniors have no time to fuss; the Seniors night 
and day
Are acting much like men gone mad (at least thats 
what they say).
Where are the smiles, the fair sweet smiles, and why 
this grouchy mood,
And why this grim and haunted look, as if by Death 
pursued?
Alas! All joy from here has fled, these gentle Profs, 
of ours,
Are having Final Exam week, against our strong 
desires,
We view this action with alarm, for it is very plain,
That many from our midst must pass, neer to re
turn again
Through all the sleepless night we cram, altho full 
well we know
Tis very likely useless and we with the lost will go.
Our girls have all discharged us for not being on the 
job.
I know its an affinity they tell us with a sob,
And so were packing up our trunks borrowing the 
carfare home;
Well all go back to grammar school and never more 
will roam.
LEnvoi.
Oh friends and chums departed, who perished long 
ago,
We may be with you mong the flunked, before an
other snow.

Michigan students ordered 4,000 yarn caps from a 
factory in Lansing, Mich., which employs girl work
ers, and when the caps were delivered about every 
third one was found to have an ardent love note at
tached to it. The notes were written in many dif
