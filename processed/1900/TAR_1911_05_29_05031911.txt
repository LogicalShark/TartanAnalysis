PITTSBURGH, PA., WEDN ESDAY, May 3, 1911.
MASS MEETING HUGH SUCCESS
Mr. Carnegie Speaks
Seldom does a great institution have the opportu
nity to entertain its founder, as did we last Thursday 
evening, when Mr. Carnegie visited us for but the 
second time in our history. By the program of the 
evening every man and woman had an opportunity 
to show those feelings of gratitude, love and re
spect which we all hold for Mr. and Mrs. Carnegie. 
Furthermore, every man and woman took advantage 
of this opportunity in such a manner that our founder 
and his wife can have no doubt of the earnestness 
and sincerity of our feelings toward them. Never beffore in her history has Tech experienced such a 
sight as this. The Spirit of Tech, that spirit to 
do, which is rooted deep in the heart of every Tech 
man or woman and that whole-souled enthusiasm in 
whatever she does, were never so manifest as upon 
this evening. It made one glad that he was a unit 
vin such a compact and harmonious whole and it mul
tiplied his feelings of gratitude and love toward 
those who have made these things possible.
Th program of the evening was opened at 8.15 
sharp by the Mandolin Club playing .Florentine 
March. The M. M. C. S. Glee Club sang The Gifts 
of Spring. The Tech Quartette sang My Hearts 
in the ''Highlands. Only upon one other occasion 
during the Vening was the' house so still as at 
Tthis moment. The selection was particularly appro
priate, well rendered, and seemed to impress the 
entire ' audience.
At this point the audience tood while the Fac
ulty and the Trustees passed up the center aisle to
the stage. No sooner were Mr. Carnegie and his 
wife seated, than the house, led by McCorkle, gave 
forth their heart-felt welcome in cheer after cheer. 
Led by Mr. McDowell, the chorus and the audience 
sang with undiminished enthusiasm, Hail Carnegie. 
Next Miss Mary Nolin, president of the Senior Class 
of M. M. C,-Sv made her way, te entire audience 
still standing, to where Mrs. Carnegie was sittieg, 
and presented her with a large and beautiful bouquet 
of jonquils.
Mr. McConway then called upon Judge Buffington 
who said in part:
I am very happy to be here at this family party 
with the doors closed against outsiders. As we are 
gathered here tonight I think of. the realizations of 
these visionsand. they were visionsof years 
As I look over this gathering ffiere comes to 
mind a scene about seven or eight years ago 
Hot Springs, Va. There were three of 
Hamerschlag, Dr. Brashear and myselfand we had 
visions. -We went to a man there who fs here to 
night. We'told- him of something dear to crQr hearts, 
of the schools growing by degrges, and. tonight .we 
see the realization of our visions.
iudge Buffington then told of the. signing erf the 
bill by which Tech hopes to grant degrees aid 
brought forth tremendous enthusiasm from the ntire student body.
Following the announcement that Mr. Carnegie 
had given the schools a 500-acre- farm located a 
short distance up the Allegheny, the student body

---------------------------------------------------

4THE TARTAN
again gave vent to their appreciation by several 
Tech yells. America was sung with a will.
Mr. Hornbostel was next introduced and spoke 
about the new buildings, a subject which is of great 
interest 'to all. He presented a drawing of the 
schools as they will appear .when completed, with the 
main entrance from Morewood avenue, which means 
of entrance will reduce, a 2,000 foot journey from the 
car line to just 300 feet.
Then, while .the audience stood, Mr. Carnegie ad
vanced, to the speakers stand to talk to his boys and 
g;rls. Mr. Carnegie said:
Students of the Carnegie Instituteof course in
cluding the girls of the Margaret Morrison School 
(applause)without which this meeting would lose 
much of its peculiar charm wThich always attends 
the presence of fair women. I am inclined to think 
that in this race, as I may call it, between the somber-looking black-garbed parties on both sides, and 
the pure, immaculate white here in the centre, that 
the young women have it. (Applause.) At'least, I 
have recently heard more about their triumphs than 
I have about the soberer half of the partyI mean 
soberer in dress. (Applause.)  _
I told them at the afternoon exercises of an in
cident which none of you heard. I was asked by the 
Normal School of New York, which is the highest 
college there for teachers, if they could send their 
Dean here to see whether the things they had heard 
about the Margaret Morrison School were really 
true.
Well, the result was that that ambassadress came 
back to New York to tell us that, much as she had 
heard of the school, she was surprised to find such 
work being done here. (Applause.) So that the Nor
mal School of New York, ranked as the highest of 
its class, is now bettering its instruction from what 
they derived from a visit to you. (Applause.) Like 
the wisemen, this, lady came from the1 East, but it is 
saying a great deal that she returned to the East 
from the West a wiser woman than when she started. 
(Applause.)
Now, such is the position you have attained at 
the Margaret Morrison School that it will be neces
sary for you to. behave yourselves in the most dis
creet and satisfactory manner. Dont fail to re
member that it is not only for the good example 
you are to set for others, but that the eyes of the 
nation are upon you. It is a delicious thought for 
Mrs. Carnegie and myself ;that already, when they 
talk schools or women,.we say; Well, let them go on. 
Just wait; you will hear something said about the 
Margaret Morrism School of.Pittsburgh. (Applause.)
I told them of another incident today that was 
not in my printed speech. I went once with a com
mittee of the councilmen of Pittsburgh to visit the 
East to see about libraries, with a view to finding a 
teacher for the library we had here in Pittsburgh, 
or were to have. We got to Boston and we said to 
the librarian, We would like to Jcnow where we 
can find the best librarian, and he replied, Why,
you have the ablest young librarian in America 
right in Pittsburgh now. Who? Mr. Anderson 
up at the Edgar Thompson Steel Works. That is 
the library I built first and employed him for it.
Well, we came home and the councilmen secured 
Mr. Anderson, and we made no mistake. Mr. Anaerson is now second to Mr. Billings of the New 
York library that is soon to be opened, and he is the 
certain successor of Mr. Billings who is soon to re
tire;-so that he will have the librarianship of the 
chief library in the United States.
Now, Mr. Hamerschlagand what a delicious 
pleasure it is when you can get a victory over him 
(applause)--just to impress him with the fact that 
he does- not know everything (laughter)was once 
on his way to Boston. I said, Where are you go
ing, and he said, I am going to Boston, and told 
me what for. I tell you, Mr. Carnegie, the class of 
young women that we are getting and .educating, 
there is no keeping them. The wise menthe wis
est men there arthey find one of my teachers 
and steal her. She goes off, gets married, and I 
have to find another. Well, I said, Mr. Hamer
schlag, I once went to Boston on a similar errand, 
and I told him that story. I said, Why dont you 
promote the assistant? I made it a rule when 1 
was in business nevr to bring in a stranger and pro
mote him over the head of the staff (applause). We 
promoted our young men. I told him the story of 
Mr. Anderson, and advised him to go home and 
trust to Providence and appoint one of his own 
people, and he did. He appointed Miss West, and 
now the other week in New York, Miss West came 
and delivered a lecture to women interested in ed
ucation there, and a lady who was present at the 
lecture told me that they didnt have anyone in the 
same line as able as'Miss West in the. whole United 
States (applause). Of course Mr. Hamerschlag is 
entitled to so much credit that it might be well to 
keep him down a little, and have him bear in mind 
that there is at least one occasion when another 
man had some part in doing something that was a 
great success for the Margaret Morrison School (ap
plause).  , - -
I hope that when the young men and women of 
these Technical Schools obtain their coveted degrees 
that Mr. Hamerschlag will be able to select from 
them the proper people to take high positions in the 
schools in which they received their own educa
tion (applause). J
Now, for the young men, who always come sec
ond: I have heard of the work that some-of them 
have already been doing, the demand that employers 
have for just such young men as are being devel
oped here. Mr. McConway has told me that he 
has already two and is on the lookout for a third, 
and that he wouldnt think of going outside the 
technical schools for the young men he wanted (ap
plause).
Isnt it startling, as Judge Buffington says, to 
think that only a few years ago we were talking

---------------------------------------------------

THE TARTAN5
about building schools here, and now they have been 
built and are already producing such men and 
women as those young men and women up there in 
the balcony who wear the badge of graduates. Why, 
it seems to me miraculous, as if it were a thing of 
a day; but there is a grand saying that The gods 
send threads for a web begun. If ever you are 
hesitating what to do, what line to follow, where to 
start, remember that. You may not see your path
way clear at first, but have faith and a determined 
mind. You will find, if you go on boldly, that the 
gods will send thread for the web that you would 
weave. Dont be afraid; there is no such word as 
fail, if you just fight with courage. As long as you 
struggle on the battle is not over, and you have not 
failed. Dont stop fighting and you will win. The 
greatest possession a young man can have, or a 
young woman either, is to have faith, in himself or 
herself and never fear. The kind fates help those 
who help themselves. Those people who fail in life, 
fail not on account of the conditions Which surround 
them, but because they lack within them the courage 
to do work that will bring- success, to do that work 
with an indomitable will.
I am sure that you will see hundreds and hun
dreds added to the list of graduates, and I hope 
Judge Buffington, that you will remind the Governor 
that we want that law to have a retro-active effect. 
It must not only include future students, but those 
who have already graduated as well. (Applause.)
I do not believe if I were to talk for ten minutes 
more, I could get a greater outburst of cheering than 
that, and that is where a practiced orator sits 
down. (Applause.) I am somewhat embarrassed. 
The suggestion that I was about to sit down received 
even louder cheering. Now, I am going to do some
thing that will bring, I .think, # louder cheer than 
either of the others. I am going to say this, I think 
Mrs. Carnegie should stand up and say a few words 
to you. (Applause.)
Mr. Carnegie insisted upon his wife saying a few 
words. The house stood as Mr. Carnegie led her to 
the front of the stage. Mrs. Carnegie said:
My dear friends: You will see what it is to be 
married. We promise, you know, to obey.
I think it is really a little bit unfair for Mr. Car
negie to ask me to speak to you tonight, but I cant 
help expressing to you the very great pleasure it 
gives me to be here with him, and just to see your
faces. It is an inspiration.
Mr. Carnegie has done a great many things in 
his life, but I think this is the most useful and the 
most satisfactory work that he was evpr engaged- in, 
starting this institution, these schools, and the 
thought of what it all means is really overwhelming 
tonight. I cant thank you half enough. (Applause.)
The girls now sang The Womans Song.. They 
occupied the center of the first floor and the first
row and center of the first balcony. When they
rose to sing, each girl dressed in White, with a spray 
of yellow daffodils, the effect was very striking and
beautiful and showed much forethought and plan
ning.
President Frew of the Board of Trustees was called 
upon by Mr. McConway and spoke, praising the work 
done by the committee on Technical Schools.
Mr. Carnegie insisted upon Dean West speaking 
and led her to the front of the stage. The Dean 
proved equal to the emergency by saying that she 
had been taught that modesty was a virtue and that 
the only way in which she could prove that she had 
that virtue was by sitting down, which she forth
with did.
Dean Leete and Dean, Connelley were next called 
upon and united in extending to Mr. Carnegie the 
thanks of the student body.
Dr. John H. Brashear, our Uncle John, was 
called on.to make a speech and he did so with that 
simple, heart to heart manner which is so character
istic to him and which has won for him the love of 
everyone.
The entire audience rose to sing America and 
those on the platform, led by Mr Carnegie and Mr. 
McConway, filed from the Hall. Thus ended one of 
the greatest events in our history in a simple, but 
impressive manner.
FOUNDERS DAY EXERCISES 
Fine Program Attracts Many.
Last Thursday afternoon the annual Founders 
Day exercises were held in 'Carnegie Music Hall be
fore a crowd that fully taxed the capacity of the 
house. Long before the time Set for permitting the 
holders of standing room tickets to enter the Hall, 
every seat was taken so that when the bell rang and 
the rush for seats began there were few seats va
cant.
The addresses were made by Mr. Carnegie, Presi
dent Lowell of Harvard, and Gov. Augustus E. Will
son of Kentucky. It was a strange coincidence that 
each of the three speakers, from as many spheres 
of life, should have each touched upon the subjects 
of civic righteousness and munieiple government.
Mr. Carnegie, the principal speaker in the eyes of 
the crowd, went the round of the departments of the 
Institute and spoke of the work of each and the 
successes achieved. He then spoke of the civic 
condition of the city of Pittsburgh and offered sug-' 
gestions for its improvement.
Experts in Democracy, was the subject on which 
President Lowell of Harvard spoke and in a very 
scholarily address he told how our government may 
be made much more effective than it now is. He 
went into the subject in an exhaustive manner, ana
lyzing, the weakness of present systems and suggest
ing remedies. President Lowell contends that in 
the proper conduct of cities permanency and expert 
knowledge are just as essential as in the operation 
of any successful corporation or private enterprise. 
His observations were of particular interest coming

---------------------------------------------------

6THE TARTAN
at a time when the demand for a commission form 
of government is one of the uppermost themes in 
Pittsburgh.
Governor Willson of Kentucky seemed to capture 
the, audience at once. He had no prepared speech 
but weat straight to the hearts Of his hearers with 
his words ;Qf good common sense and optimism.
'haannual report was interesting, showing as it 
did the progress made by the various departments 
of the Institute. . r : 
Mr.- Frew announced the winners of the 15th an
nual art exhibit. The first prize was given to Mr. 
John W Alexander for his painting Sunlight. Frank 
Craig of Branshot, England, carried the second med
al with his portrait of Sir John Jardine. Algeron 
Talmage, of London, England, took the third medal 
with his painting entitled The Kingdom of the 
Winds. After the exercises the galleries were opened 
and the larger portion of the. audience went to see 
the pictures.. ,, ...
; , s ....   ~ i  - "  ;
CIVIL ENGINEERING SOCIETY MEETS.
Saturday, April 29, the Civil Engineering Society 
held its regular, monthly meeting. The arrangements 
for the final meeting this year were discussed. The 
society has made it, a custom to entertain the pros
pective students in civil engineering and welcome 
them as new members of the department. The meet
ing will be held either Friday, May 19 or Saturday, 
May 20 and all such prospective students, whether 
they intend to become members of the society or 
not, are cordially invited to attend. Further notice 
will appear in thie Tartan.
After the business of the evening each member of 
the society drew a slip from a number which had 
been prepared by Prof. Thayer and on this slip was 
a subject on which he was to make a short talk. The 
speeches "proved to be very interesting.
John R. Boyd, Secretary.
A VERY FINE AFFAIR.
The second annual Concert and Dance, given by 
the Tech Design Club last Monday was unquestion
ably a very fine affair and reflects credit upon the 
young ladies of this excellent club and especially 
upon the committee arranging same, the names of 
the members of which the Tartan would publish but 
finds that they do not appear on either the concert 
program or dance program, due probably to modesty 
on the part of the members.
From beginning to end the affair wag enjoyed by 
all. " 
The concert was very good; good judgment being 
used in the arrangment of the program. The lyric 
quartette composed of the Hodgdon brothers, Rose 
and Crawford made the hit of the evening.
The vocal selections rendered by Mr. Alpredd Bartletti appeared to make a hit with the large audience 
so also did those rendered by Mrs. McClure.
With regard to the dance everything went along
without a hitch, very liberal encores being given. 
There were 20 dances, 4 extras and 3 extra extras and 
they were all danced although it took until 2,30 a. m. 
to do it. Mostly everybody stuck them out.
MUSICAL CLUB NOTICE.
The Glee Club will assemble at the Field House 
immediately after the field meet next Saturday, May
6. At this time an informal reception will be held, 
during which the Glee Club will sing several numbers, 
trophies and prizes will be awarded, etc., etc.
On Friday, May 12, at 8.30 p. m., the Annual Mus
ical Club Banquet will be held at thee Hotel Schenley. This function will be formal.
A concert will be given at the Carnegie Music Hall, 
in Duquesne, Monday, May 15. All men are asked to 
be at the hall by 8 p. m. Allowing one hour to get 
there from the city.
The last concert of the season will be held at the 
Hotel Schenley ball room, June 6. After this con
cert silver watch fobs will be presented to the faith
ful members of the musical clubs for this season.
SENIORS HONOR JUNIORS
. - :   .  ; . : : l :! fi . . . ' - - > fii 1 jAs a culmination of the entente cordiale that has
always existed between the two classes, the entire 
Senior Mechanical Class, Messrs. Hanford and 
McCartney, or in short, Mac and I, intend giving 
a banquet in honor of the Junior Mechanical Class.
The banquet isalso given in return for the banheld by the Junior Mechanical Class early in the 
school year and to which Mac and I were in
vited.
Mac and I have already canvassed the best ho
tels in the city for the best prices and report that 
they have hit upon a swell place to hold it. Up un
til now some difficulty has attended the matter of the 
selection of a date on which to hold the affair; a 
date that will be convenient to everybody, the de
mands of society on the Junior Mechanicals being 
very great at the present time, they thinking they 
they are very popular with the fair sex.
It is to be hoped that a date convenient to all 
will be settled upon and that Mac and I will have 
their banquet.
CRAFTSMENS CLUB MEETING.
The Craftsmens Club will hold the postponed 
monthly meeting of March 17th, next Friday evening, 
May 5th, at 9.30 p. m., in the Club Room in the In
dustries Building. It is urged that all members and 
proposed members try to be there as there will be 
some very inportant business to transact. Arrange
ments are to be made for the annual banquet to be 
held in a couple of weeks. The charter for the year 
of 1911 will be closed on this night so it will be the 
last chance for you to join if you still remain outside.

THE TARTAN7
P. A. A. CONCERT.,-Vi' S  ..................  - *
The, Saturday night concert of the Glee and Man
dolin Clubs, at the Pittsburgh Athletic Associations 
new club house, was a complete success. The gym
nasium, which is arranged for such affairs, was 
crowded and every number was encored again and 
again, requiring two and sometimes three appear
ances.
As usual the members of the clubs let no opportu
nities get by them and every one . thoroughly in
spected the building. The object receiving the most 
attention was the wild and wooly western bucking 
broncho driven by an electric motor. Martin and 
Crawford, having considerable courage, gave the 
crowd an exhibition of good riding.
Lunch was served to the clubs in the state din
ing room at eleven thirty and was enjoyed by all. 
The Glee Club made a big hit with the club members 
by singing between courses.
C. M. E. S. HOUSEWARMING AND RECEPTION 
TO Pj_EBES.
As announced last week in the Tartan there will 
be a housewarming in connection witif'"the acquisi
tion of a new club room for the use of the Carnegie 
Mechanical Eiigineeriirg Society, on Saturday, May 
the 6th, 8.15 p. m. 07 '
The event Will also take the form of a reception 
to the plebes who nave elected the Mechanical 
course.
All 'of the faculty of Machinery Hall have been in-- V A * if ;   >vited, including Mr. Geiss. According to the latest 
advices there is enough money in the treasury 
(thanks to the efforts of Mr. Munk) with which to 
purchase a piano, and it is expected that same will 
be purchased in time to be used on the event.
With regard to the program for the evening an 
endeavor will be made to have a few vocal selections 
from those in the Mechanical Department who have 
sung for the school. In this connection, Messrs. 
Ormston, Kindle, Phillips, Patterson, Kukovitch, 
Schuchman and Paisley will be asked to render some 
selections.
Messrs. Stearns and Bigelow, purveyors for the 
event, say that the menu will surpass anything that 
has been given so far at the society meetings. 
Messrs. Wright, Hatton and Schweitze will act as 
sub-perveyors. The past officers of the society have 
been invited to participate in the affair. It is to be 
hoped that there will be a grand turn out and that 
all delinquent dues .will be paid up before the event. ,
CIVIL GEOLOGY TRIP
In spite of the inclement weather, about twelve of  
the Scphomqres took a very interesting and instruc
tive -trip on Saturday, the 29th to Glensboro, Pa., 
where a small ccal mine was inspected and roughly 
surveyed. Professor Smith was one of the fellows;, _
and joined heartily in the laughter at the expense of ; 
those fellows whose style of architecture was not 
suited to be crowded into a space about four feet 
high. Noted features Of the trip were Bergmans 
fondness for cocoanut; Haass wonderful story of 
walking forty-five miles in eight hours ; Stetrarta ' 
stolen ride on a hay wagon ; Baileys attractiveness 
in Duffs hat, and last, but not' least,- the two Ihches 
of mud on the floor of the mine. Dick Ten-fo6tf' 
Brown said he would not enter the mine. Its a ! 
shame that anybody told him beforehand that th 
mine was only three and on-hlf feet high several 
placs. Dick by the way was the only Junior 
miner in the crowd. ' J
SOPHOMORE CLASS ROUTED.
______ i. .  f
Last Monday some of the Sophomores had more 
fun than they have had since the last time thejf  
beat up the Plebes. The class was surveying, as 
usual, in front of the Margaret Morrison School, 
conducting themselves as civil as possible, while 
making a number of stadia readings of the surround
ing country. While diligently engaged in the pur
suit of knowledge in front of the old house across 
from the M. M. C. S., Mr. Maurice Stubnitz, the 
smallest, man in the class, was suddenly confronted 
by a woman with a butcher knife. She told Stubby 
in tones distinct and clear .that she objected to his 
footsteps on the fron., lawn. Meanwhile, Stubby, 
who can work ten calculus problems a night, but 
who declines to argue with any woman, especially 
one with a butcher knife, flew terror stricken to his 
friend Jim Haas, past grand master on all ques
tions regarding femininity., Jim went to the res
cue and the class was saved. , ,
We deeply regret that lack of time did not permit. 
of this article appearing in the Founders Issue, ,,f 
as we feel sure that Mr. Carnegie would have left a 
medal for our hero.
Prof. Kellar enjoyed himself.
The fact that they didnt take the flashlight is 
probably due to the presence of so many Junior <

Mr. W. L. Munk came too late to get a seat in the 
allotted place for his class, but was successful in 
getting a seat among the chorus. Mr. Munk had 
quite a time convincing the doorkeeper that he be
longed to that vocal organization. Mr. Munk is a. 
very truthful man.
Prof. Trinks occasionally looked in the direction

Mr. Carnegie was highly pleased when informed 
of the rapid progress being made by the recently

this: commendable organization.

Carnegie Technical Schools
The past week has indeed been a full one and one 
which we are likely to remember as long as we live 
and which will be talked of by those students who 
are to follow us and who will receive some of the 
benefits accruing from the various events which 
happened. First, we had our Founder in our midst 
and for the first-time did he have the opportunity 
of seeing and speaking to us in a body. Second, we 
received notice that we soon are to have the power 
to grant degrees, a power much desired since the 
founding of the schools. Third, a new entrance plan 
was announced one which will save us and the future 
generations many weary steps. Fourth, we were told 
that Mr. Carnegie had given a farm of five hundred 
acres to the Schools for use as a practice field; This
farm is located about 20 miles up the Allegheny river. 
Fifth, we won from Pitt in baseball by a score of 
15 to 1. And all of this happened in one day!
Mr. Carnegies visit to Pittsburgh was a grand 
success in every direction and the mass meeting held 
on Thursday evening, was, to our minds at least, the 
crown jewel. The way in which the alumni and stu
dent body turned out to greet him showed in no un
convincing way the manner in which we regard Mr. 
Carnegie. It was a just tribute to a man to whom 
we, both as individuals and as an institution, owe 
a debt greater than we can pay, one, in fact, that we 
can not hope to repay except by deeds and actions. 
Moreover, that meeting, we believe, marked the be
ginning of a new era in our life as an institution and 
from now on our spirit will grow stronger, better, 
more robust and will take upon itself more and more 
the characteristics of the man who founded it, keep
ing before the eyes of mankind all of the ages that 
the Carnegie Technical Schools are to exist a picture 
of that wonderful little man, Andrew Carnegie.
While received with great enthusiasm, the news 
of the signing of the bill by Governor Tener came 
as no great surprise to us, since we have known 
through the press that such a bill had been intro
duced and passed by the Senate But the fact that 
we knew about it does not in the least detract from 
our pleasure now, for the granting of degrees has 
been a thing desired by every class graduated and 
by every person connected with the institution. It 
is our just due. The work done in the several de
partments is of the highest type and in doing such 
work we should receive the mark which it deserves. 
Just what value a degree has does not enter into the 
argument in the least. Other institutions which we 
beiieve do inferior work to ours, have the right and 
power and in all that is just we should have the same 
right and power. We now have it. We are also 
pleased beyond Words by that fact.
Another thing which we have to be thankful for 
is the planning of a new entrance, one which is much 
shorter and more convenient than either of the en
trances now in use. The most disagreeable feature 
of Tech has been the getting to it. On pleasant spring 
and summer days it has been, if you were on time, 
not so objectionable to take the long walk over the 
bridge but on a slushy winter morning or evening 
with the wind blowing fifty odd miles per hour it was 
something which we can not fittingly describe in 
public print. To all of those who had anything to 
do with this change in plans we owe and most will
ingly give our most sincere thanks.
Sure Substraction.FreshyProfessor, is it ever 
possible to take the greater from the less?
ProfessorThere is a pretty close approach to it 
when the conciet is taken out of a freshman/* 
Brooklyn Life. [

The advantages of this plan can easily be seen and appreciated.

THE TARTAN
MRST MEET SATURDAY.
The annual Inter-School Track and Field meet, 
which will bp an event of Saturday afternoon, May 6, 
will be the'first of its kind for the new season. Be
sides being the annual contest for the Hamerschlag 
trophy, it will be made the basis upon which will 
depend the choice of athletes to represent the schools 
in all of th later meets.
In connection with this contest between the three 
mens schools, a meet for High Schools and prepara
tory schools will be given. Great interest has been 
aroused in this among the schools of Pittsburgh and 
its vicinity and the entry list includes eleven schools 
with over two-hundred contestants. There is little 
doubt on the part of the management that the sue- * 
cess of this meet will warrant making it an annual 
event.
The two meets will be run simultaneously and will 
start promptly at one oclock. Director Hamerschlag 
will be the chief official umpire, with Mr. McCulloch 
as clerk of course. On account of the large number 
of events' the meets will be started exactly on sched
ule timeand the races run as closely together as 
possible. The winners of events in the Hamerschlag 
meet will receive a pair of track shoes, while those 
securing second place will eactt be "made the recip
ient of a track suit. Medals will be given to first, 
second' and third place then in the Intef-Scholastie 
events.
The admission will be by athletic ticket for stu
dents of Carnegie Tech, but twenty-five cnts will 
be charged for all others. The management and the 
faculty request that everybody not entered as con
testants reach their seats by way of the gate and 
allow the Field House to be used for quarters for 
the athletes.
On Saturday, May 13, a dual meet will be held 
with the University of West Virginia at Tech Field.
LOSE TO ALLEGHENY,
The game with Allegheny College at Meadville on 
Saturday, April 29, was an evenly divided pitchers 
battle in which Allegheny finished first with a shade 
better luck than Tech. While Alleghenys five hits 
came at-such times as to net them three runs, Tech, 
with an equal number of bingles, failed to score.
The Tartan team outplayed the home team in 
every way in the field, but at the  bat were unable 
to place the hits out of reach of Alleghenians when 
safeties would count most. Vail was the star for 
Tech at the bat and in the field. Moorehead pitched 
a good ganje with eight strikeouts to Hawks five.
Firestonej who was seen here in basket ball during 
the winter played a fast game at short step. Hawk 
also fielded his position well, figuring in a double 
play for his side. The score:

TENNIS.
Now that Jupiter Pluvius has put his foot on the 
soft pedal fcr awhile at least, tennis prospects be
gin to assume a reality. The two school courts have 
been put in shape for action and it is hoped that all 
fellows who can play will take advantage of this 
opportunity-to start practice.
This year, as usual, Carnegie expects to send a' 
team to the intercollegiate tournament at Geneva Col
lege, and there is a good chance that one and possibly two or more match games will be played with 
other colleges in the vicinity. Plans are under 
way to start a handicap tournament within two or 
three weeks to pick men who will represent the 
school in these events. Only two of last years 
team are in school, Duff and Food, but there is 
an abundance of material from which to make up an 
entirely new team.
The question of adopting tennis as a school sport 
is now up to the Board of Control, to be decided at 
their monthly meeting to be held this week. It is 
hoped that there is a full attendance at this Board 
meeting, so that tne tennis men'may know on ;what 
ground they stand, as regarding school insignia, fi
nances, etc. Therefore, practice all you can, inter
est all the men you can, work hard to get a good 
tennis team, and above all, keep up in school work.

THE TARTANil
FOUNDERS DAY GAME WON. 
Pitt Beaten, 15-1.11 > 
The first home game for Carnegie Tech was an 
overwhelmingly easy victory for the Skibos. The 
University of Pittsburgh was reported to have a 
baseball team that could walk away with a contest 
with us, but the Founders Day game showed the 
Tech varsity to be superior in every way to the best 
that Pitt can produce this year. Urquhart pitched 
the entire game for Tech and scattered the hits so 
well that, with the excellent support of his team 
mates he was never in any danger. Too much can
not be said of the fielding of the home team and of 
the manner in which they supported each other. 
Gearhart was the star in this respect, starting two 
successful double plays, but all members of the 
team were in the game all of the time. The hitting 
was not as heavy as it might have been, but the 
players landed opportunely and, helped by the poor 
playing of the Blue and gold, piled up that awful 
score of 15 to 1.
McDowell, ex-High School star, started the game 
for Pitt but was taken from the box in the second 
inning, after seven runs had been scored by his 
opponents. These were due mainly to pitched balls 
that the catcher cquld not or would not go after. 
Pollsek replaced McDowell and was hit freely fcr 
the remaindeer of the game. Stambaugh was the 
star hitter of the game with two pretty bingles to 
the hill for two bases each and one clean single. 
The two former might have been stretched over 
three bases by a faster man, for they were hard to 
recover. Pitts only run was made in the second in
ning. Nevergold knocked an easy fly to Saunders. 
Stambaugh put his first hit to the hill and reached 
second. McNary fanned and Quailey singled, scoring 
Stambaugh, but was caught at second, Shenafelt to 
Brine.
A dispute arose in the sixth, when with Saunders 
on third and Gearhart on second, Shenafelt dumped 
one in front of the plate, scoring both men on the 
throw to first. The umpire decided the hit was foul 
and sent the two runners back. Shenny then re
peated his stunt, with the variation that he was safe 
on second by an overthrow by Stambaugh, and the 
two runs were scored. The score:

CHAMPIONSHIP GAME.
Reports are being circulated in the Sophomore 
class of a baseball game between the Bottle Washers 
and the Monko Club on Thursday morning. As the 
score keeper has disappeared with the score book, 
the ball and the gate recipts, this cannot be verified. 
From a spectator, however, the following informa
tion has been gleaned. Clements pitched a star game 
except for one bad inning. That inning was all that 
spoiled his chances, of pitching on the varsity in the 
future. He also hit well^ having a doubtful home 
run to his credit. Rayburn was the slugger for the 
electricals. Two of his hits in the eighth brought in 
five runs. The star play of the game was when 
Clements knocked a high one to Johnston in right 
garden with Crawford on first. The sweet-voiced 
singer from Altoona dug for second, reached third 
on an overthrow to first, then in answer to the cries 
from his teammates went back to second and rested 
allowing the whole Monko team to assist in putting 
him. out at first. In spite of plays like these, the
B. Ws. insist that two of the six umpires should 
not have been electricals. The line-up included:

Mr. Carnegie has recently presented to the De
partment of Architecture a set of designs by Mr. John 
Wynkoop made in the Ecole des Beaux Arts of Paris 
and awarded a medal. At the time these drawings 
were made Mr. Wynkoop was the holder of the second 
Paris prize scholarship which was given during his 
incumbency by Mr. Carnegie. As a mark of his ap
preciation of Mr. Carnegies generosity Mr. Wynkoop 
presented these drawings with some others to Mr.
Carnegie who has transferred them to our school. 
The designs show a very high degree of architectural 
talent and skill and form a very valuable addition to 
the collection of drawings being assembled by the 
Department of Architecture.
The students and faculty of the department passed 
and forwarded to Mr. Carnegie a testimonial of their 
gratitude for this generous gift.
BANQUET AT MONONGAHELA HOUSE
On last Saturday evening the night draftsmen held 
their first annual banquet. There were thirty guests 
present. The principal speakers and guests of the 
evening were Dear Connelley and Prof. A. C. Leeds. 
Director Hamerschlag was unable to attend owing to 
a severe case of tonsilitis. The program, which was 
a lengthy one, proved quite entertaining. Much 
credit is due to the committee for the manner in 
which the affair was handled.
A letter dealing with the future plans, accompa
nied by a picture, was read by Wm. Butler, Vice Pres
ident cf the Club. The regular program was fol
lowed by informal jokes and stories, the meeting not 
breaking up until late.
The committee consisted of the following men: W.

The Girls' Glee and Dramatic Clubs are working as 
never before in order to get ready for the May Day 
performance which will probably take place the sec
ond week in May. There are to be songs and dances 
of exceptional grace and every girl who fcas promised 
to give her aid is working with boundless enthusiasm 
4 to make this May Day the very best ever in the aa% nals of history. The scngs and dances are introduced 
through a skit which tells of the departure of winter 
end the coming of spring.
Mass meetings have been held for the past two 
weeks as a preparation for the large .mass meeting 
tonight. The Girls Glee Club has been practicing 
faithfully and will make their first public appearance 
of this year. A few of the boys from the mens 
I Glee Club were present at one of the rehearsals and 
sang the new school songs with the girls. It is 
this spirit of unity which is going to make the school 
a living factor in the events- of the. prtsent genera- * 
tion.
The committee for class songs is still glad to receive any contriljptions from the girls. At present 
' we have four or five to choose from. The names 
have been distributed for the writers of Ivy Ora
tions'. The competitions have been handed in and 
only the future can foretell who is the lucky winner. 
The entire Class Day program is well under hand 
and this very fact insures its success.
Any news for the girls column of the Tartan

The Junior Class of the M. M. C. S. designed and 
embroidered a tea cloth for Mrs. Andrew Carnegie. 
The designs were worked out in squares and were of 
a thistle motif. The contest for design was in the 
Junior Art class and the successful designs were 
made by Elizabeth Yagle, Annie Felkel and Helen 
Boyd. The second problem for the girls was a de
sign for a letter to accompany the cloth. Lina Connelleys. was chosen. The twenty-five squares were 
embroidered in the sewing class. One of the squares 
was different from the others. It was made with the 
M. M./C. S. and 1212 embroidered in a conventional 
design. ,
The cloth was put in the room of Mrs. Carnegie 
with some daffodils. It was displayed at Mrs. Lau
ders reception and Mrs. Carnegie was very much 
pleased and said that it' just fitted her table at Skibo.
