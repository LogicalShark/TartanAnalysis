MR. ADVERTISER
Do you really know the advertising 
value of a school paper? Do you 
realize that Carnegie Tech is the larg
est technical school in the United 
Statesnot going to be any more, but 
IS? Do you realize that 2500 students 
are enrolled hereenough to make a 
good sized town with no children or 
old pepple? Do you know that The 
Tartan is its only student paper and 
appears 36 times during the school 
year? Now, Mr. Advertiser, dont you 
think it would pay to let these young 
money spenders (three-fourths are 
men) know what you have to sell? For

! MR. CARNEGIE COMING! *
*
FOUNDER TO VISIT SCHOOLS APRIL FIRST.
As announced by the various Deans of the schools 
last week, Mr. Andrew Carnegie, founder of the 
schools, will be here to see them running on April 
first. He will come from Southern California, where 
he is at present with Mr. Chas. S. Taylor, of the 
Board of Trustees of the Institute, and is expected, 
to spend April first, second and third in Pittsburg. 
That he will spend the entire first day 'here is cer
tain. He has not seen the schools running since 
their founding, and has been in the buildings but 
once.
After leaving Pittsburg, Mr. Carnegie will go to 
New York, and by the first of May will be in London.
All of the arrangements, except his date of com
ing, are tentative and subject to his wishes. For 
this reason we cannot give a detailed schedule of 
how the day is to be spent. Arrangements have 
been completed by the Tartan to obtain photo
graphs of his visit to be used in the issue of April 6, 
which will be made the special one in place of that 
announced last week for Founders Day.
The visit is an important one to the schools and 
it is entirely in the hands of the student body to 
make it what it is wanted to bea glimpse of Tech 
at work.

4THE TARTAN
A BLIGHTED ROMANCE.
1 he following is a clipping from one of the morning 
papers. As it refers to the president of the 1913 Night 
class, it will probably be of some interest:
When Mrs.- Peabody (as we shall call her) of Wilkinsburg, entered a grocery store some time since, she 
found the grocer in the act of opening a crate of eggs 
and placing thereon a card bearing the legend: "Strictly 
Fresh40c dozen." She purchased the first dozen out 
of the crate. When she came to use some of them she 
descried upon one of the eggs what seemed to be writ
ing, and handed it to my son, aged 21, to decipher. 
Upon close scrutiny the young man found if to contain 
the following message:
This egg was packed by Miss Polly Peever, Inde
pendence, Kansas, age 20, single, blond, good-looking, 
and wants a husband. If you are a single man, write. 
Being a single man and somewhat romantic withal, 
the Wilkinsburger promptly addressed a letter to the 
fair purveyor of Kansas hen fruit and invited further 
correspondence with a view to matrimony.
Meanwhile he refrained from eating the egg, which 
he treasured as a cherished keepsake. A few days ago 
he received the following letter:
Mr. Allen Peabody,
Wilkinsburg, Pa.:
Esteemed SirYour kind reply to my message on the 
egg received and I thank you sincerely for the chival
rous sentiments expressed. When I wrote that I was 
aged 20, single and desirous of obtaining a husband I 
was stating the exact truth. However, I am now aged 
26, married, and the mother of three children. Again 
thanking you, I am now'
Mrs. Polly Peever Pipkins. 
Independence, Kan., Feb. 10, 10.
Mr. Peabody still refrains from eating the egg, but 
not from any considerations of a sentimental nature.
TECH FIELD TO BE CONDITIONED THIS WEEK, 
Team Will be in Fine Shape for Opening Game.
The large base-ball squad is fast rounding into 
shape and the prospects are that Tech will have 
the most successful season in her short history on 
the diamond. The old field is now fairly dry and 
the weather warm enough to work out of doors, 
factors entering largely into the form displayed by 
the candidates. The squad now numbers about 50 
men. Our trouble in the past has usually been the 
lack of good material for the pitching staff. It is 
not expected that there will be the slightest trouble 
this year in the getting together of a good working 
force, as there are over 15 men out for that position, 
most of whom are above the average.
Captain Coldren is elated over the seasons pros
pects, and said after the practice Saturday, There 
is not the slightest reason in the world why we 
should not win our games this year. We have plenty
of good material out and there will be lively compe
tition for every place. With these facts in view, I 
can see no reason why Tech should not have a most 
successful season.
The home season will open up April 9th, on Tech 
Field with the University of Pittsburgh. Mr. Weidlein started Monday to have the field put in condi
tion for the opening day. This will be the first 
base-ball game played on the new field ,and it is 
planned to make the affair a gala event. One thing 
is certain, the game should be a hummer.
The details for the Eastern trip are very nearly 
worked out. The exact number of men to be carried 
and their names cannot be decided as yet, but will 
be announced in the Tartan as soon as any decision 
is reached.
Captain Coldren hurt his leg slightly sliding home 
at practice Saturday afternoon. It is not very seri
ous, fortunately, and the Captain will be at practice 
Wednesday, when he desires all outfielders and in
fielders to come out.
THE MHO CLUB.
The Mho Club held its regular monthly meet
ing in room 121, Science Building, on the evening 
of Wednesday, February 9. After the customary 
parliamentary proceedings, a vote of appreciation 
and acceptance of their invitation was extended to 
the Crucible Club. Mr. Culbertson then entertained 
the club by a very interesting and exceedingly in-. 
tractive talk on Railway Motor Testing. The 
method and means of making the various tests and 
the manner of working up the data were thoroughly 
explained, accompanied by lantern slides, which 
added to the interest and clearness of his explana
tions.
The executive committee were then instructed to 
make preparations for the Mho Club Base-Ball team 
for the approaching season, after discussing the 
coalition of the Mho Club and several other popular 
Applied Science clubs for the purpose of holding a 
dance.
The Mho Club members displayed their spirit of 
good fellowship by readily approving the proposition. 
Whereupon a committee was appointed to inter
view the aforenamed clubs regarding the details of 
the same. The members then retired to their com
fortable club room to dispose of the repast and in
hale the fragrance of the Turkish Dreams, pro
vided by the executive committee.
John A. Clark, Secretary.
THE CRAFTSMENS CLUB.
The Cdaftsmens Club held a special meeting Fri
day evening, March 11, 1910. Mr. Connelly was the 
chief speaker of the evening and gave us a very 
interesting talk concerning the coming of Mr. Car
negie in the near future. The Craftsmen will hold 
their annual dance early next month, and all the 
new members are earnestly requested to be present

---------------------------------------------------

THE TARTAN5
at the meeting Friday, March 18, when final arrange
ments will be made. All the Craftsmen who expect 
to go to this dance will have to be present at this 
meeting.
Mr. Broadmerkle, of the Craftsmen Club, was 
starring in a recent minstrel show held in the Car
negie hall, IBraddock. It is said that the colored 
papulation present envied Mr. Broadmerkles com
plexion.

VISIT STEEL MILLS.
After a series of talks and demonstrations on iron 
and steel making, the A night class in forging, ac
companied by Mr. Taylor, visited the Edgar Thomson 
plant of the Carnegie Steel Co. on the night of the 
16th of February. It was intensely interesting and 
instructive, and by way of recreation was most ac
ceptable, While at the forge of the Edgar Thomson
plant, Mr. Taylor gave us an idea of the value of a 
steam hammer by working a billet to shape; Speicher 
manipulated the levers in good style.
The same class on the Wednesday following, ac
companied by the A day class in forging visited the 
Isabella furnace, and the Spang-Chalfant pipe mill. 
Altogether the trips were a success.
To all who helped to make the visits enjoyable 
the class as a unit conveys its best thanks.
All Thistle material is due March 28th.

Engraving and etching was the subject of a most 
interesting lecture given by Mr. Balkan to the Sen
ior Class and part of the Juniors, on Fri
day afternoon. In a big general way, 
which could not have been other than clear to every
one present, the difference between line and wood 
engravings, mezzo tints, and etchings, was delight
fully explained. Mr. Balkan also spoke of the val
uable exhibition in the Art Department of the Car
negie Institute, and urged that the girls study the 
etchings there and become educated in that line of 
Art. After knowing and understanding what etch
ings means, one could not help but appreciate the 
beau.ty of that Art.
Friday morning our school was visited by twentyfive teachers from the Thermot State Normal School.
Mrs. Philput has been away from school for nearly 
two weeks with grippe. Friday marked her first 
day back after her sickness. Miss Cauble was also

ket-ball game played between the Juniors and 
Plebes, the score being 2213 in favor of the Jun
iors.

EDITORIAL
THE DAILY LAMPOON.
Our attention has beerr called to the article appear
ing in the Pittsburgh Chronicle-Telegraph of last 
Friday which said in part:
SPLENDID SCHEDULE FOR PITT FRESHMAN 
NINE.
Although the University of Pittsburgh will 
not be represented by a Varsity baseball team 
this year, the freshmen expect to have a strong 
outfit. . . Manager H. K. Leitch is arrang
ing a splendid schedule of games away from 
home which include the following: April 9, Car
negie Tech Varsity; April 22, East Liberty Aca
demy; April 29, Jeannette High School; May 11, 
DuBois High School;
Somebody has his information badly balled up. As 
we have stated so often in this column of late, it 
seems as though there was a wholesale misappre
hension as to the gentle art of correctness in news
paper reports. We do not know if the list quoted 
above is as was reported by Manager Leitch of Pitt. 
If it is not the Tele owes both Pitt freshmen and 
Tech an apology. If it is, then we will look to him 
for an explanation.
Within the past three weeks there has hardly been 
a day when some falsehood about Carnegie Tech has 
not been seen in the Pittsburgh papers. They are 
falsehoods just the same, even when used with the
Our profound sympathy is extended to Miss Wil
liams on the recent death of her uncle.
Notwithstanding the fact that there will be an 
Easter vacation in three of the schools next week, 
the Tartan will appear as usual.
The Carnegie Number of April 6, will take the 
place of Founders Number announced last week. 
Special arrangements have been made, however, to 
get Taft photographs for the Tartan on the latter 
occasion.
THISTLE MATERIAL DUE MARCH 28.
All material for this years edition of The 
Thistle will be due on March 28. Get busy, Mr. 
Representative and Historian and get your work 
done. All drawings, photographs, jokes, personals, in 
fact everything that is to go in the book positively 
must be in the hands- of the members of the board 
at that time. Subscriptions for copies of the book 
must be in the hands of the business manager or one 
of his numerous assistants on or before April 4 th 
to insure getting a copy. Snapshots of Juniors are 
especially desired as well as those of athletic events 
and affairs of interest.
It will be necessary for fraternities, clubs, socie
ties desiring space to make application in writing 
to the editor-in-chief as soon as possible as the com
mittee on the apportionment of the space of the book 
is at present at work on the task.
WHITE FRIARS CAST CHOSEN.
The selection for members of the cast for this 
years production. Miss Mistaken was made after 
three trials, the last of which was held last night.

THE TARTAN7
NEWS FROM THE MEDITERRANEAN.
The Scranton (Pa.) Times contained an interesting 
article by E. J. Lynett written on board the Grosser 
Kurfuerest enroute to the Mediterranean. The por
tion of interest to Tech students follows:
Within an hour from our departure from the pier 
we were called to lunch and found as messmates at 
our table Dr. Henry S. Drinker, president of Lehigh 
University at South Bethlehem, . . and Dr.
A. A. Hamerschlag, president of the Carnegie Poly
technic Institute at Pittsburgh, and Mrs. Hamer
schlag. . . . We loose Dr. and Mrs. Hamerschlag
at Algiers, . . . but Dr. Drinker and his family
remain with us throughout the cruise until we reach 
Rome.
Compliments Benjamin Watrous.
Among the matters of local interest which Dr. 
Hamerschlag told us was the fact that Benjamin 
Watrous of the class of 1909, is one of the most 
promising young men who ever graduated from the 
Carnegie Polytechnic Institute. In the opinion of Dr. 
Hamerschlag he is destined to be a great mining en
gineer. This was especially pleasant news for Mrs. 
Lynett, for Benjamin Watrous was one of her favorite 
pupils some years ago, when she was a teacher in 
the Scranton Public Schools. It struck me, too, that 
the mine cave question offers a problem worthy of 
the attention of a great mining engineer and that 
Benjamin Watrous has at his very home a subject 
worthy of his high talent.
Upon receipt of the news that Mr. Carnegie would 
visit the schools on April first and second, Dr. Hamer
schlag at once cancelled his arrangements and is on 
his way back. A cablegram received yesterday states 
that he will return on March 28th. He is at present 
in London, and has visited Spain, Algiers, Italy, 
France and England.
All Thistle material is due March 28th.

The Sophs have given up their banquet and given 
two dollars apiece to the Athletic Association in
stead. There is a devotion to duty worthy of a 
Suffragette.

Some of the Mining and Metallurgy students vis
ited a coal-washing plant near Donahoe on Monday. 
They were much surprised to find the coal blacker 
than ever after washing.
Styri wants to learn camp-cookinghe says he 
can make use of this knowledge on ski-running trips 
when he gets back to Norway.
The curriculum committee of the School of Applied 
Science have been at work concentrating the course 
of study for the Plebes of next year.
It looks like serious business when high officials of 
the Woodlawn Club buy new white pleated shirts 
for use when calling.
Embrio White Friars can be seen hopping about 
most any time of day.
Dean Leete expects to go to Cornell within a week 
at the invitation of Prof. Lawrence of the Department 
of Electrical Engineering of Sibley College to ex
amine their equipment and methods.
This about April 4, does not happen to be a joke. 
Just wait until you hear.

Many of the miners, metallurgists, and some civils 
were seen at the American Institute of Mining En
gineers.
The Sophomores and Applied Design Day men have 
the record. It fairly rolled in, even if it does mean 
no show for until the White Friars.
Case and Reserve also ran.

THE RESCUE.
(An Episode in A. and J. Class History.)
There was tumult mongst the Freshmen,
In the halls of dear old Tech.,
They were looking out for trouble,
Yes, for trouble, by the peck,
For the rumor fast was spreading,
Neath the noses of the Profs.,
That the president was taken,
Yes, abducted, by the Sophs.
What! The president abducted?
And the Smoker was that night.
How they growled, and how they murmured, 
And made ready for a fight.
Why, the outrage was undeard-of.
Theyd avenge him, that they swore,
Till the Freshman class meant terror 
To each living Sophomore.
THE FOURTEEN ERRORS OF LIFE.
The fourteen mistakes of life, Judge Rentou, re
cently told the Bartholomew Club, of London, are:
To expect to set up our own standard of right 
and wrong and expect everybody to conform to it.
To try to measure the enjoyment of others by our 
own.
To expect uniformity of opinion in this world.
To look for judgment and experience in youth.
To endeavor to mould the dispositions of every
body alike.
Not to yield in unimportant trifles.
To look for perfections in your own actions.
To worry ourselves and others about what cannot 
be remedied.
Not to alleviate if we can all that needs allevia
tion.
Not to make allowance for the weaknesses of 
others.
To consider anything impossible simply because we 
ourselves happen to be unable to perform it.
To believe only what our finite minds can grasp.
To live as if the moment, the time, the day were 
so important that it would live forever.
To estimate people by some outside quality, for it 
is that within which makes the man.Ex.
