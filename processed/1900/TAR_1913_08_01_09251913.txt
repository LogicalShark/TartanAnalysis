By Special Correspondent to the 
Tartan.
Well, we have been to camp, and 
strange as it may seem, we are stil^ 
very much alive after a lot of stren
uous work.
Arriving at camp we awoke to the 
fact that we would have to pitch our 
own tents. This we proceeded to do 
much in the same manner, and with 
the same uncertainty, that the Plebes 
sing their favorite opera selections 
before the enthusiastic Sophomore 
audiences in front of the Industries 
Building, while Professor Stanton 
stood close by, and kidded us about 
it, which greatly added to our embarassment. We hardly had the 
tents pitched before the dinner bugle 
sounded, and should you be possessed 
with that feminine virtue termed cur
iosity, we will say for your benefit 
that the meals we had at camp were 
nothing more nor less than a classic 
and it was the opinion of all that a 
place in the Hall of Fame would be 
no too great an honor for our chef, 
as his efforts certainly made our stay 
at camp much pleasanter than it 
would have been had the menu of
1912 been repeated. The remainder 
of the first day was spent in arrang
ing camp, erecting a bridge, and in 
building furniture, which was done 
with a skill and ingenuity, that would 
make Dr. Pfouts heart fill with joy.
This year the camp was in charge 
of Dr. Day, of M. M. C. S., and was 
conducted on a modified military plan, 
which proved to be a great success. 
An officer of the day was appointed 
daily fronr among the seniors, whose 
duty it was to look after the welfare 
of the camp, and to see that the 
fatigue party kept busy, and did not 
skip to Freeport too often. The fa
tigue party was also appointed daily, 
and consisted of four men. They 
had to keep camp clean, and make 
themselves generally useful. This 
fatigue party was an innovation of 
Dr. Days this year, and certainly 
had a great deal to do with the neat 
appearance of the camp. Our sched
ule consisted of arising at half past 
six, much to the disgust of many. 
Breakfast was served at seven, and 
at eight we began work. Dinner came 
at quarter past twelve, and that was 
none too soon for the majority of 
us. One oclock found us at work 
again, in which state of being we ex(Continued on Page 5.)
Each year the faculty is somewhat 
changed by the addition of new mem
bers and the loss of old ones. This 
year there comes to us as the most 
important appointment, Prof. Thomas 
Wood Stevens, formerly of the Uni
versity of Wisconsin. Prof. Stevens 
is a graduate of the Armour Institute 
of Technology in Chicago. He was 
the head of the department of illus
tration at the Art Institute of Chicago 
many years, and is the literary critic 
to the Inland Printer, a well known 
art magazine. He is a contributor to 
periodicals, and has earned a reputa
tion as an author. He had charge of 
several pageantry plays produced in 
Chicago and of the Historical Pageant 
of Illinois, produced at the North
western University. Professor Stevens 
will become the head of the depart
ment of Dramatic Art in the Design 
School, and will assume his duties by 
having charge of the second annual 
fall festival tomorrow evening.
The Tartan extends to Prof. Ste
vens a hearty welcome, and hopes the 
most friendly relations will be es
tablished between him and the stu
dents, who should consider them
selves extremely fortunate in secur
ing the services of a teacher of Prof. 
Stevens ability.
Amoiig other changes in the faculty 
is the transfer of Mrs. Philput, the 
former librarian of the Design School, 
to the Margaret Morrison School, 
where she will become the assistant 
dean.
The following number of appoint
ments has been made for the ensuing 
year: Five in the School of Applied
Science, four in the School of Applied 
Design, six in the School of Applied 
Industries, and six in the Margaret 
Morrison Carnegie School. All of 
these will take the places vacated by 
last years occupants. Information 
regarding these teachers will be con
tained in the next issue.

Progress in executing the proposed 
plan of Tech buildings has been con
tinued during the summer by the 
starting of two new buildings, the 
head house of the Industry School and 
an addition to the Margaret Morrison 
Carnegie School. The former will 
conform to the style of the present 
building, and will be connected with 
the Industry School. The new struc
ture will be used as an administration 
building, containing the offices of the 
members of the executive staff of the 
schools. Much attention, from an 
architectural standpoint, will be giv
en to an elaborate spiral stairway. On 
the third floor it will open onto a 
balcony, which will form an entrance 
to an immense club room for students. 
The completion of the building will 
mark the passing of the Beanery, 
for the basement will be converted 
temporarily into a restaurant.
The addition to the womens school 
will extend across the hollow and 
close the one end of the stadium. 
With the number of students contin
ually increasing, the present quarters 
were found too cramped, and the erec
tion of another portion of the build
ing was made necessary. As it now 
stands the building is about onefourth complete.
Work on the Design School is be
ing pushed rapidly. Much of the in
terior decorating has been done and 
the greater part of the building is now 
available for scholastic purposes. The 
theater, in keeping with the other 
artistic effects of the school, will be 
artistically finished. The sculptured 
work on the exterior will be contin
ued until all of the niches are carved. 
When completed, the Design School 
will be a fitting monument to the finer 
arts.
Perhaps the most needed and wel
comed improvement on the campus 
will be the new walk which the city 
is laying through Woodlawn avenue, 
from the Margaret Morrison School 
to the Industry Schooi. The Muddy 
Trail will soon be gone and forgot
ten. The old tennis courts have also 
been improved, while the four new 
courts started last spring are now 
in playing condition.
It has been estimated when the 
present building operations are con
cluded, two-thirds of all of the build
ings of the proposed plan will have 
been erected.
ro vm hSSuppmd immmdpatmlyc
The opening of another school year 
is marked by the opening of another 
building. Though not entirely finish
ed, the enlarged Machinery Hall will 
be occupied immediately, and will 
house the electrical engineering de
partment, in addition to the mechani
cal engineering department as here
tofore. The plan of the building is 
very elaborate, containing many archi
tectural and engineering features.
The most noticeable of the former 
will be a tower to be erected on the 
central portion of the building. The 
tower consists of a series of columns 
in the center of which will be a smoke 
stack. Around the stack will wind a 
staircase. From the top of the tower 
a commanding view of this entire dis
trict of the city may be obtained. The 
tower will complete the vertical plane 
of the building, planned in contrast 
to the horizontal plane of the Design 
Building at the opposite end of the 
campus.
The main entrance on the east side 
of the building is another of the 
architectural features, and is very im
posing. In the basement and on the 
first floor are the laboratories, the 
largest of which is the electrical lab
oratory. It occupies almost an entire 
floor and is two stories high. Be
tween the main sections of it are two 
light and sound proof lecture rooms. 
These are well equipped with the ap
paratus required for <ne demonstra
tion of difficult and accurate experi
ments. The laboratories of the me
chanical department have not been 
moved, but more space has been allot
ted to them, and they have been gen
erally improved. On the upper floors 
are the recitation rooms, which are 
unusually large and well lighted.
The building, when completed, will 
be one of the most modern and best 
equipped engineering schools in the 
country.
The following changes have been 
announced, to take place at once: In 
the Science Building, the civil engin
eering department will occupy the 
rooms formerly taken by the machine 
design department; while the latter 
will be moved to the former quarters 
of the electrical engineering depart
ment. Shortly after the opening of 
school, Dean Leetes offices will be 
movied to Machinery Hall.

1917! f
The Plebes of this year and the 
Seniors in 1917, the class that will 
then be the backbone of our Alma 
Mater, this message is for you.
College life for all of you is some
thing new. It is different here from 
what it is in colleges, and what you 
have pictured of college life. The at
mosphere is different. It is the at
mosphere of work! Work from the 
time you register until the time that 
you leave with your diploma. You 
came here to work; and to stay you 
must work.
Now is the time for each man to 
take account of himself, and as far 
as he is able, decide what his pro
gram will be throughout his entire 
stay at Carnegie. How much time 
is to be spent in studying, how much 
time is to be given to student activi
ties, and how much time is to be 
given to the gentle art of fussing.
There are traditions here as there 
are in every school, and it is the duty 
of every man entering to uphold these 
traditions to the best of his ability. 
The student activities are various, and 
of a scope large enough so that each 
and every one can find a place in 
them. No man is supposed to enter 
all of them. It would be nearly im
possible for him to do it and keep up 
his standing in his studies. But he 
can go into one activity until it be
comes an integral part of himself.
One of the traditions is the wear
ing of the Plebe cap. This should not 
be worn with a sense of fear, but 
proudly as a class insignia, the class 
for which he will go through thick 
and thin during his school career, and 
of which he will always speak proud
ly. The little cap is a bond by which 
classmates recognize each other as 
having a common interest in the best 
class in school,

During the past summer, more than 
half the students at Tech have been 
working, to gain practical experience 
directly in line with the studies they 
are pursuing in college. Mill and shop 
and office, laboratory and field and 
drafting room held out, last June, a 
multitude of jobs, little and big, 
which Tech students hastened to take. 
It would be interesting to get ac
curate statistics, if it were practicable, 
showing the amount and kinds of 
work that the students did; but the 
records of the Bureau of Recommen
dations show a list of positions filled, 
which may be taken as typical of the 
work that the students as a whole 
pursued.
One hundred and sixty-six men 
were placed in summer positions by 
the bureau, at wages aggregating 
$34,350.40. These figures are consid
erably in excess of the records of pre
vious years, both as to number placed 
and as to earnings. A consist
ent effort is made every year to 
secure the kind of work that will be 
most beneficial to the students. In 
nearly every instance the work se
cured last summer, was of a technical 
nature, and the student sent was able 
to gain the advantage of practical 
work along the line of his chosen 
trade or profession.
Of these hundred and sixty-six men, 
44 spent the summer in shopwork 
(machine, foundry, pattern, etc.) 28 
were engaged in electrical work (wir
ing, testing and repairing), 19 were 
on surveying corps, 12 in chemical 
Vaboratories, 14 in mechanical and 
structural drafting rooms, 8 were em
ployed as timekeepers on construc
tion work, 11 at clerical and statis
tical work, 7 as draftsmen and tracers 
in architects offices. Other lines of 
wrork, in which six men or less were 
engaged, were tutors and companions, 
teachers in summer playgrounds, so
cial service work, chauffeurs, inspec
tors, salesmen, open hearth and blast 
furnace work, assaying, cement test
ing, translators, etc., etc.
The following comparative table 
shows number of students engaged, 
their aggregate earnings, and the aver

summers:

Since the founding of the Tartan, 
each year has seen an improvement 
over the one preceding. Two years 
ago it took its present form, one which 
was considerably more expensive than 
the older and smaller sized editions. 
The general result of this improve
ment was a more satisfied body of 
readers, but the added expense neces
sitated a poorer quality of paper 
stock and an almost complete taboo 
on all cuts of current events. Still
further it was absolutely necessary 
that a number of six and four page 
editions be printed in order that we 
pay our bills.
There has been so much objection 
to the six and four page editions and 
to the lack of cuts showing current 
events that an investigation of condi
tions was made with a view to better^ 
ment. This investigation included 
other college weeklies, and it was 
found that The Tartan was the only 
one having a subscription rate of less 
than $1.50. Since a rate of this kind 
for The Tartan was the only thing 
possible which would solve thm dpffps
culty we have increased it to tni 
amount.
We sincerely hope no one finds it 
necessary to discontinue his subscrip
tion because of the increased rate. On 
the contrary we believe subscribers 
will increase since The Tartan will 
be more worth keeping.

One of the first things that will 
catch the eye of the returning student 
will be the new tennis courts. These 
courts are situated between the De
sign and Industry Schools. There 
are four of them. Although they are 
not as solid as the old ones, they have 
a better location and by spring will 
be very good tennis courts.
Most of the men interested in ten
nis will remember the petition pre
sented to Director Hamerschlag. This 
petition contains several hundred sig
natures, the faculty and students join
ing in the request for new courts. The 
tennis management, A. D. Beeken 
and R. S. Wilson, takes this opportu
nity to thank Director Hamerschlag 
for these courts. We thank him in 
behalf of the hundreds of students 
who play tennis at Carnegie. We also 
desire to thank publicly Mr. Weidlein, superintendent of buildings and 
grounds, for the admirable courts he 
has constructed.
We all appreciate these courts, but 
actions speak louder than words. 
Come out and play, thats the way to 
show your appreciation and the best 
way to improve the courts. But dont 
play when the courts are wet.
The nets had not arrived up to the 
time of the writing, but before school 
opens the Athletic Association will 
undoubtedly take care of this diffi
culty.
Come out and play! Freshmen, 
dont be shy. Everyone be sure to 
enter the tournament. It will start 
next week.
A baseball umpires actions have 
caused him to be declared crazy. As 
a rule its his decisions that cause 
others to act that way.
A crisis in conditions affecting the 
worlds food supply is predicted by 
Prof. Dickson of the Edinburgh Uni
versity. This means more work for 
the Department of Agriculture.
No satisfactory explanation is of
fered of the fact that warning the 
public of a plays immorality proves 
its earning capacity.

A student who considers himself el
igible to become a registered voter in 
Allegheny county should present him
self for assessment in the assessors 
office in Court House Annex, at least 
two months before the election of 
November 4th, 1913.
On one of the three regular regis
tration dates for 1913, August 28, 
September 2nd and September 13th, 
he should present himself for regis
tration at whatever place is designat
ed for his election district. He will 
be required at that time to present 
his tax receipt.
Having been registered, he can go 
to the office of the commissioners of 
registration in the Court House An
nex, and secure a certified statement 
of his registration. This statement, 
upon presentation to the registrar of 
the Carnegie Institute of Technology, 
will entitle him to the fee rate charged 
to residents of Pittsburgh.
Any person who is either (1) too 
ill to appear at the registration place, 
or (2) was unavoidably absent from 
the city, on the three above days (Au
gust 28th, September 2nd and 13th) 
can secure at the office of the com
missioners of registration in the Court 
House Annex the necessary blanks 
with which to register after the above 
dates. If he pays his tax between 
September 16th and October 4th, he 
can be registered at the above office 
on October 15th.

Believing firmly in a closer co-op
eration between Industrial and Educationallnstitutions, to the advantage 
of both, twenty-eight College Profes
sors representing the electrical engin
eering departments of twenty-six col
leges are spending their vacations 
working side by side with the skilled 
mechanics and engineers of the Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing 
Company at East Pittsburgh.
By taking this course, the profes
sors are aiming to accomplish a four
fold object; to obtain a first hand 
working knowledge of the methods 
of practical electrical engineering; to 
secure the opinions of successful en
gineers and manufacturers on the 
qualifications of men needed in in
dustrial work, so that they may be 
taught accordingly and thereby be 
properly qualified for success in their 
chosen branches; and exchange of 
teaching ideas among themselves; a 
study of the industries of the Pitts
burgh district.
Many of these professors are heads 
of departments in their respective 
schools and the average length of 
time spent in teaching is SVi years.
The professors are employed on the 
regular shop payroll and conform to 
shop hours and regulations, receiv
ing therefor a compensation of 22c 
per hour, or an average of $55.00 per 
month; the regular rate for second 
year apprentices.
The Westinghouse Electric & Mfg. 
Co. is a warm supporter of this move
ment of co-operation between the in
dustrial and educational institutions, 
and has delegated its highest officials 
and engineers to meet with the pro
fessors and explain to them the work 
of the various departments of the big 
electric works; each phase being ex
plained by an expert in his line.
At the close of working hours in 
the evening, these student-workmen, 
without stopping for dinner, get a 
lunch of sandwiches and coffee and 
proceed on a trip of inspection 
through the works, guided by shop 
foremen and superintendents, ending 
in a meeting for discussion of the 
points covered on the trip.
College professors are usually lack
ing in practical knowledge of works 
management and efficiency methods 
and it is hoped by this course to gain 
such a knowledge from close contact 
with such work and the men who di
rect it.
At the evening meetings, lectures 
are given by engineers, work-managers, foremen, and also educators from 
their own crowd and the educational 
institutions of the Pittsburgh district.
In such meetings, and by close as
sociation with one another for a pe
riod of several weeks ideas are ob
tained and fully developed that prove 
of immense advantage in furthering 
the work in which they are engaged.
that is, teaching electrical engineering.
The course opened and will also 
close with a dinner given by the 
Westinghouse officials.
Prof. Geo. B. Thomas, of Colorado 
College, has charge of the course and 
is looking after the details in addi
tion to working himself.
A complete schedule has been work
ed out covering the lectures and the 
Industrial Plants, one of which lat
ter is visited each week.

It was during the winter of 1912 
that somebody mentioned it, and the 
idea grew, finally materializing into 
a real live camping party of twentyfive girls. What a fine time they had 
planning for it! Miss Stannard was 
the chaperone, foster mother, head 
cook and goodness only knows what 
not, but her efforts were most truly 
appreciated and every member of that 
camping party sincerely thanks her 
for giving them such a fine time.
They arrived, bag and baggage, at 
the Mansion June 28th, and with
out unpacking or getting settled they 
went for a swim in the river before 
dinner. After dinner there was much 
squibbling and fussing over blankets, 
cots and rooms, but finally all set
tled down for a good sleep.
Everybody was up for breakfast the 
next morning (this habit was later 
neglected), and soon made the ac
quaintance of the house and grounds, 
also the canoes.
Then began two short weeks of joy
ous activities.
Oh, how short they we e! Swim
ming, canoeing, taking long tramps, 
and, oh, yes, cooking, were the main 
features, but there were many varia
tions.
Then came a night when Miss 
Stannard gathered her flock together 
and took all up to the movies at 
Freeport. All enjoyed the show so 
much that they decided to have one 
of their own, which far surpassed the 
one at Seitzs.
Soon came the arrival of the Tarentum Campers. Oh! how they 
could sing! They could also dance, 
and since there were almost enough 
men to go around there was a dance 
every night. When it got too hot to 
dance, everybody sat on the porch 
under the Japanese lanterns and 
sang.
The 4th was quiet and sane till 
midnight, when the boys by the river 
decided to give a seranade. Dishpans, kettles, horns, cowbells, fire
crackers, war whoops and dear knows 
what else, all blended to make one 
long harmonious discord and chaos 
reigned supreme in the Mansion. 
The marshmallow toast was the 
last great event at camp, although 
goodness knows there were many 
minor ones.
The campers will never forget their 
trip to Camp Carnegie, and they wish 
to thank the director and the trustees 
for allowing them the use of the 
Mansion and for doing all they did 
for them. The girls certainly had a 
fine time and hope that they will be 
allowed to go up again in the sum
mers to come.
During the summer there has been 
besides the big camping party several 
smaller ones, varying in size from 
five to ten. The girls in these parties 
1 ave all reported as having had a 
delightful time at the camp.
Two members of our faculty have 
left our happy midst to have a home 
of their own. Miss Mary Arrowsville 
was married in June to Mr. LeRoy 
Gimnd, and is living at Dormont, Pa.
Mrs. Katherine Johnston was mar
ried to Mr. John Warren Vance on 
August 28 at Chatauqua, N. Y. They 
will be at home to their friends after 
the first of October in Wampum, 
Pa.
Miss Mary B. Bartleson was mar
ried July 2 to Mr. Arthur E. Vail. 
They are at home to their friends in 
New Kensington, Pa.
In June Miss Mary B. Orr was 
married to Mr. Charles H. McCandles 
and are making their home in Pitts
burgh.
A quiet home wedding was given in 
Washington, Pa., when Miss Charlotte 
Poe Rutherford was married to Mr. 
Harry Holiday, on Tuesday, August 
26. They will be at home after Octo
ber first at Craft avenue and Kennett 
Square, Pittsburgh.
Miss Lucille Hutchinson married 
Mr. Charles Martin on August 30th, 
and will make their home in Beaver 
Falls, Pa.
Wednesday, September 24th Miss 
Katherine Billeville was married to 
Mr. David Miller, at Sewickley. They 
are building a home, at which they 
hope to entertain their friends in the 
near future.

Cable dispatches report general re
joicing in Great Britain over the pas
sage of the new Wilson tariff bill. 
The Daily Chronicle says the passage 
of the bill is a triumph for relative 
free trade. It says:
If Cobden himself were to take 
President Wilsons place tomorrow, 
he could hardly do more or better 
than President Wilson has done. We 
can only reiterate our regret that at 
such an epoch in the history of trans
atlantic trade this country should go 
blind to such opportunities, as well 
as to its fraternal duties, and to de
cline an official participation in the 
San Francisco exhibition. 
Workingmen in Pennsylvania may 
be feeling a bit blue, but the ad
ministration has at least won the un
disguised approval of Great Britain.

When the New Design Building 
opened its doors for regular classes 
yesterday, it started on the second 
year of its existence. Though not 
completed yet, everyone hopes to see 
it so, by the end of the year. The 
first of the decorative nitches in front 
will be completed in another month. 
To give some idea of the cost of the 
nitches it might be said that the one 
now being sculptored will cost as 
much as some school buildings. In
side the vaulted foyer the magnitude 
and beauty of the building is at once 
apparent. The huge engaged col
umns leading to the theater are all 
hand-carved, as also is the decoration 
of the theater. The floor of the foyer 
is inlaid with marble floor plans of 
famous buildings. Between the the
ater and exhibition in the floor is 
inlaid Michael Angelos plans of St. 
Peters Cathedral at Rome. In the 
main corridor are found the plans of 
the Parthenon, Temple of Chartres, 
and the Temple of Edfu.
The Rehearsal rooms in the base
ment are completed, there being a 
beautiful piano in each.
The library which has been enlarged 
is now the most complete Architec
tural and Art library in this country. 
Mr. McGoodwins photographs, which 
he made a special trip to Italy to 
purchase, have been classified and 
bound and is the most complete rec
ord of Italian Architecture in exist
ence. Mrs. Philput, the Librarian last 
year, has been called to the Margaret 
Morrison School to assist Miss Breed 
the Dean. Mrs. Wappat, a trained 
Librarian, will take her place. The 
new Trinity Chimes have arrived, and 
are certainly an improvement over 
the old call bells used to announce 
classes.
There will be several new faces 
among the faculty. Mr. Hitchens, 
from the University of Pennsylvania, 
will take Mr. Schwabs place, who is 
now with Spaul, the architect. Mr. 
Janson will be the new professor for 
the piano.
Mr. Derdeyn will teach cello play
ing, also will have charge of the 
stringed orchestra. Mr. L. C. Dillenbach will replace Dad Jones as 
Massier in the Architectural Depart
ment.
Mr. John Bamberry will be in the 
salesroom, which has also been en
larged and now carries a full line of 
artists and architects supplies.
Hays, Crosby, Wilson and Dillenback will return to take up post
graduate work.
The enrollment of the school is so 
far ahead of previous years that the 
new wings will soon have to be built. 
The school of Music having the larg
est enrollment.
Mr. Stephens, of the Art Institute 
of Chicago, is here to start the School

isted until five. Few were absent at 
six oclock when we had supper, and 
the same can be said about Prof. 
Stantons lecture, which occurred at 
seven. That being over there was a 
general exodus for Freeport.
1 he surveying this year as formerly 
was under the direction of Prof. Stan
ton, who had spent a large part of 
the summer visiting the summer en
gineering camps of many of our lar
ger universities and technical schools, 
in order to become better acquainted 
with the methods in vogue in the 
various institutions. It probably will 
suffice to say that Prof. Stanton saw 
to it in his characteristic way that we 
kept on the job, and did not spend 
too much time gazing at the fair 
Freeport maidens through the tran
sits, as so many were wont to do, 
especially Pentermann.
Speaking of Freeport; if anyone 
should ask you, you may say that it 
is the same old town it always was, 
where the passing of. an automobile 
through the streets produces enough 
excitement to cause temporary sus
pension of all business, but even at 
that it sort of served as a life pre
server for many of us. They have 
a picture show up there which runs 
vaudeville occasionally. Because of 
the name vaudeville with which these 
performances were known, we felt 
it our duty to laugh at the comed
ians antedeluvian jokes, not because 
we could see anything in them1 to 
laugh at, but because all the natives 
did, and we did not want to show 
our ignorance.
Monday evening came at last, and 
we placed our transits in their cases 
for the last time. Tuesday morning 
we began to break camp preparatory 
to leaving that afternoon. It was not 
without a feeling of regret that we 
broke camp, for as hard as we worked, 
we had a mighty good time, and are 
all looking forward to the time when 
we can go back there again and re
new old memories, by pointing out 
the place where we ran a level for 
a quarter of a mile and only made 
an error of four feet or so. Also 
when Cunningham used to take his 
cold showers every morning, with the 
temperature in the vicinity of the ab
solute zero, while the rest of us hudduled around the fire, and debated 
as to just what form of insanity he 
was afflicted with. Afternoon soon 
came, and after saying farewell to 
Freeport, we departed, agreeing one 
and all, that the camp had been one 
grand success, and a great credit to 
the school.

A young lady at Bath Beach had 
occasion to complain about one of 
the bathhouse attendants, an old fel
low who, in the hurry of cleaning up, 
would sometimes burst in upon her 
in her bathhouse without knocking.
One morning, after this had hap 
pened for the sixth or seventh time, 
the young lady took the old fellow 
to task.
See here, Peters, she said, theres 
no lock on my bathhouse, as you 
know, and I must insist on your 
knocking before you enter. It hasnt 
happened yet, but it might very well 
happen that youd come in on me 
when I was all undressed.
Peters, with a chuckle, hastened to 
reassure the young lady on this point.
No fear of that miss, he said.

The silly season is over and there 
is no dearth of good news of all sorts. 
It is all the harder to grasp the reason 
for this excitement about the coming 
of Mrs. Pankhurst. Probably it was 
a humorist who first raised the ques
tion whether Mrs. Pankhurst would 
be denied admission to this country; 
but his joke has succeeded beyond all 
expectation. Solemn dispatches from 
Washington now deal with the sup
posed intentions of the immigration 
authorities and the State Department, 
but we have yet to see the slightest 
reason advanced why Mrs. Pankhurst 
should be kept out. She is not a 
refugee from the laws of her own 
country. Even if she were, she would 
be free on the clear showing that she 
was a political refugee. She is not an 
anarchist under the definition of our 
alien law. It is evident that a person 
who is fighting for votes for women 
is no enemy to votes and to consti

History of Iron Compared With 
Other Metals.
Evolution, as defined in Websters 
dictionary, is unfolding. There is 
nothing more interesting than un
folding or unraveling the complete 
history of iron ore, how it occurs in 
nature, how it is discovered, located, 
surveyed, mined and lastly the many 
steps it has to pass through before 
it is finally made into the thousands 
of different steel products.
Murder and crime of all kinds have 
been tightly woven into the search for 
gold, yet a mine of iron ore is a far 
better enterprise on which to take 
risks than most any other metal. Hun
dreds and even thousands have strug
gled vainly through the snow fields 
of Alaska in search of the precious 
yellow metal, and still the final re
turns for all net far below the final 
returns from adventures for iron ore.
 Sources of Supply of Iron Ore.
The great supply of iron ore has 
been furnished to the many eastern 
blast furnaces mainly from the Lake 
Superior district. By the stroke of 
a pen Benjamin Franklin in settling 
the boundary line put within the 
United States one of the greatest iron 
ore district in the world. Little did 
he realize the vast wealth he placed 
just south of the northern boundary 
line of this country.
The two chief ore producing states 
of the Lake Superior district are 
Michigan and Minnesota. As early as 
1844 iron ore had been discovered on 
the Marquette Range. The old range 
ores, or those from Michigan, come 
from the Marquette, Crystal Falls, 
Menomenee, Penokee Gogebic and 
Iron River districts; the new range 
ores from the Mesabe and Cuyuna 
Ranges in Minnesota. One of the 
characteristics of the old range ore is 
that they are known as the hard 
ores, while the Mesabi ore is a soft 
ore.
Exploring for Iron Ore.
In exploring for iron ore the first 
question in mind is the location of the 
property; that is, the township, range, 
and forty that it lies in. Often the 
locating of a property is exceedingly 
trying. I remember of locating one 
property to be explored and it took 
one day and a walk of twenty-two 
miles to locate the section corner.
The first thing to do when examin
ing a forty, if it is not already easily 
located, is to go to the court house 
and look it up in the original govern
ment survey. In this survey details 
will be given which will be sufficient 
to make a good start in finding at 
least one of the section corners. 
Locating Section Corners and Section
Lines.
Section corners are noted in many 
different ways; on the Marquette 
Range an iron post, set by the Cleve
land Cliffs Company, is very common, 
on the other ranges the corner may
be a blazed tree, the original govern
ment corner, an iron pipe, a marked 
stump, or a square post, in fact most 
anything is liable to be set where the 
original government corner was.
The one corner having been located 
the others may readily be found by 
pacing with the use of the dial com
pass. The corners once located, a sec
tion line about three feet wide is blazed 
out. This is easily done by means of 
a set-up with the dial compass, and 
a pocket line established by the stand
ards of the compass. I have run lines 
for a mile or so by pickets and hit 
the corner post squarely in the mid
dle of the line.
lpal fompass and lpp-nmmdlm 
gurvmysc
Corners and section lines located, 
the next thing is a preliminary geo
logical survey, aided by the sun-dial 
compass and the dip-needle The dial 
compass after being corrected for 
longitude, from standard time to tru<? 
solar time, for the position or polaris, 
and for errors of the compass itself, is 
ready for use. Often the corrections 
for longitude and for time only are 
made, as these two are the most im
portant, the others being small er
rors. A true north and south line may 
be established by observations on po
laris at night.
The readings taken by the dial 
compass show magnetic variation east 
or west of the meridian; the dip-nee
dle shows the variations due to the 
magnetic attraction in the vertical 
plane. The dip-needle is always held 
in the plane of the needle on the dial 
compass when read.
While the compassman makes ob
servations with the dial compass and 
dip-needle, and paces the distance, the 
geologist notes the general topogra
phy of the country, the kinds of rocks, 
the glacial deposits, and everything 
that he thinks will be of importance 
in his field observations. It is not 
uncommon to include the birds, trees, 
flowers, roads and houses on the map. 
The lines of survey are set at various 
distances apart, depending on the in
formation previous to surveying, or 
information which has been obtained 
from outside sources. Ordinary sur
veys are run on the quarter, eighth 
and sixteenth lines.
The property now having its sec
tion corners located, its section lines 
cut, and a preliminary geological and 
magnetic survey made, the explorer is 
ready to consider the most likely place 
for setting up a diamond drill.
lpamond lrpllpngc
Drilling is of two kinds, depend
ing on the character of the country 
in which the exploring is being done. 
Tf a heavy covering of surface is en
countered preliminary churn or wash 
drilling to ledge has to be done. 
Churn drilling is done by means of 
a wash drill jerked up and down by a 
churn buck. The water is forcev 
down the wash rods and comes up the 
casing, carrying the loose sand and 
gravel with it.
After the ledge has been encoun
tered by churn drilling, the churn 
buck is disconnected and a diamond 
drill set up. A diamond drill con
sists of steel rods with a black dia
mond bit on the end, revolved round 
and round by a diamond drill engine. 
The rods are under a pressure of from 
125 to 200 pounds per square inch, due 
to a hydraulic cylinder connected to 
the drill engine.
The depth of diamond drilling va
ries on different ranges from 300 feet 
in the Iron River district, to 2,400 feet 
and over on the Marquette Range. 
The drill core and cuttings are care
fully kept and filed. Careful analysis 
and records of all the formations 
passed through are recorded. A good 
drill man can tell the character of the 
rock by the color of the drill water.
The ore deposit, when encountered, 
is shown by the core, the cuttings, the 
water, the character of the drilling, 
whether hard or easy to obtain foots
age, and finally by the laboratory anal
ysis of the samples. Once the ore is 
encountered the ore body is carefully 
drilled, located, and the size of the 
ore deposit estimated.
flmarpng and ghaft gpnkpngc
The next step is the clearing and 
getting the property ready to open 
a mine on it. Clearing is no little 
task, as it often represents weeks of 
hard labor at stump pulling, swamp 
filling, etc. The property having been 
cleared the most suitable place for a 
shaft is considered and mine opera
tions begun.
Shaft sinking may be comparatively 
easy or extremely difficult, all de
pending on the character of the 
ground. Slate and iron formation are 
easy to sink a shaft in, but in driftcovered areas where there are a hun
dred feet and upwards of overburden 
of sand and gravel, it is quite a dif
ferent thing, and represents a problem 
which many a skilled engineer has 
laid awake nights thinking over.
Shafts may be of wood, steel or 
concrete. The Rodgers-Brown shaft 
in the Iron River district is concrete, 
as are many of the shafts on the Men
omenee and Marquette Ranges. The 
shaft is usually sunk off the ore-body 
and drifts and cross-cuts made to it. 
After the ore is mined out one method 
of carving is to blast away the wood
en pillars and allow the roof to cave. 
This is the caving system of which 
the old Lake Angeline mine on the 
Marquette Range is an excellent ex
ample.
gtoSkpng and ghppppng to Topnts of 
lmstpnatponc
The ore is hoisted to the surface in 
skips and dumped on the stock pile 
to await shipment, when the ore sea
son opens on the lakes. Then it is 
loaded by shovel in ore cars and sent 
to Marquette or Escanaba, and here 
loaded into ore boats to be sent to 
Cleveland, Ashtabula or Buffalo. After 
it is received at any of these points 
it is loaded into cars and shipped by 
rail to Pittsburgh or other eastern 
iron centers.
On reaching its destination it is 
quickly unloaded by a car-dumper and 
again stored in stock piles at the fur
naces. This ends the first great step, 
the geological division, and now it 
enters into another field, that of metCOLLAR

Electrical engineers and others in
terested in lighting are in Pittsburgh 
from all parts of the country attend
ing the seventh annual convention of 
the Illuminating Engineering Society, 
which opened Monday morning in the 
Hotel Schenley. About 200 visitors 
registered and among them was Mon
sieur Georges Claude, a noted inventor 
of Boulogne, France. At Wednesday 
evenings session of the convention in 
Soldiers Memorial Hall he gave the 
first demonstration in this country of 
the neon tube lamp, which electrical 
engineers the world over believe is a 
remarkable step forward in illumi
nating.
The neon tube lamp, so named be
cause its success depends upon neon, 
an element of air, may revolutionize 
lighting the world over, some engi
neers declare. It is nothing other than 
a glass tube filled with neon which is 
ignited by an electric spark and pro
duces a wonderfully soft yet brilliant 
rose-colored light. It can be produced 
far more economically than any other 
kind of electric light. Monsieur 
Claude demonstrated his invention in 
all its phases.
An interesting feature of the Mon
day morning session was the presenta
tion to the society of a historic gavel 
made by the Philadelphia (Pa.) sec
tion of the society. The gavel was 
presented by Prof. George A. Hoadley of Swarthmore College, Swarthmore, Pa. The gift was received in 
behalf of the society by P. S. Millar, 
its president.
The constituent parts of the gavel 
represent periods of advancement in 
illumination in the United States. 
Several parts were contributed by 
Thomas Edison, there are two pieces 
of iron obtained from a bracket, the 
design and making of which were 
supervised by Benjamin Franklin; 
also a vial of original Welsbach light
ing fluid made in Welsbachs labora
tory in 1887, an electrode used in the 
first magnetic arc lamp in 1903, with 
many other interesting parts, each of 
which has some historical significance.

Monday were captured by about 40 
sophomores and forced to parade 
through the Oakland district.
The plebes were forced to take off 
their coats, roll up their trousers 
above their knees, turn their hats in
side out and parade through the rain. 
The sophomores had long poles with 
which they proded the plebes in the 
ribs to enforce their demands.

I sang de Swanee River
In days of long ago.
I sang about de Chariot
An wished it would Swing Low. 
I danced de good old Essence
An fancy steps beside,
But dis ragtime musics sumpin
I sholy never tried.
Is picked upon de banjo
While young folks shoo deir feet. 
Sashay an swing yoh corners!
Cut dat pigeon wing so neat!
De coon song was invented 
By de white folks in deir glee,
An de white folks gotter sing em 
Cause dey aint no count to me!

From a baseball problem submitted 
to the Philadelphia Inquirer:
A runner on first base. Man at 
bat hits ball to infield; shortstop 
throws ball to second base and puts 
runner out; trying to make a double 
play hits the runner with his arm, 
drops the ball to the ground. Umpire 
behind catcher calls man out running 
at first, claiming man running to sec
ond interfered with play.
Here is the Inquirers answer: 
Runner should return to third 
base.

Carnegie Techs first week of train
ing was marked by light practice work 
while the coaches looked over the new
ing table for the use of the varsity 
squad. The old training house at the 
athletic field has been put in repair 
and a chef engaged to supply proper 
food for the athletes. While it is be
ing tried as an experiment, it will be 
established if it proves of value to 
the team.
Capt. E. L. Clair is one of the most 
popular athletes in the school. In

he is also leader of the track and field

We have classified our advertisers so that our readers may use the list 
variety of merchants for any article which a student, alumnus or faculty 
for reference before making purchases. The grouping furnishes an excellent 
member would be likely to buy, and there is no valid reason of which we are 
aware that would justify anyone interested in the welfare of The Tartan in 
making purchases from any but merchants who so kindly make such a publi

will find enclosed in your Tartan every other week, to the clerk from whom 
you make the purchase. The stubs, we have found, make pleased advertisers 
and help to get new ones. May we depend upon YOU to take this as a re

men that are applying for admission 
to the school. On account of the 
dearth of letter men who will be in 
school this year, it is on the new can
didates that the coaches are depend
ing for varsity material.
Some 25 of these new men have re
ported to date and a number of others 
are expected as soon as classes have 
been started. Many of the applicants 
bear records of good work on prep 
school gridirons, and barring acci
dents, should form a team that will 
be above the average in weight for the 
Plaid school.

he holds a high position in the meets 
of the district.
The only other old men who have 
reported to date are Quarterback Hall 
and Tackle Welch. Several others 
are expected out when they resume 
their school work next Wednesday, 
but most of the faces on this seasons 
team must be new. Judging by repu
tation, one of these will be Burke of 
Cleveland Central High School, who 
was picked for the all-scholastic team 
of Ohio. Freemuth, coming from Du

Getting Into Action
The coaching staff remains much as 
during last season, with Dr. Marks as 
head coach, Ernie Cozens training the 
line men and Athletic Director McCulloch handling tie backs. With 
these men the staff stands among the 
best in the district, and if coaching 
will make a winning team out of light 
material Tech will meet with great 
success.
While the preliminary training 
camp at Glencairn was abandoned for 
this season, an innovation was intro
duced byr the establishment of a trainwili make a good bid for the job of 
guard. Kesner of Tarentum is a can
didate for the position of quarter
back and is said to possess the neces
sary requirements for the place. The 
practice of the week gave little 
chance to judge the candidates. It 
consisted only of such light work as 
would get the men in shape for later 
training. Scrimmage will be started 
early in the week and the squad cull
ed out for preparation for the first 
game with Penn State on October 4.
