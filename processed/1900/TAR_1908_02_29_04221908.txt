VOL. II, No. 29 art a n
PITTSBURG, PA., WEDNESDAY, APRIL 22, 1908.TEN CENTS.
SIR WM. PREECE ON TECH
Under the title of Technical Education in Am
erica, there appears an article in the Journal of the 
Royal Society of Arts which is descriptive of Tech 
and is of interest not only for the reason that it 
gives a foreign estimation of the institution but, 
further because the writer is a man whose name is 
famous as a scientist the world over. He has said 
in part:
On April 11th, 1907, I took part in the opening 
of the Technical Schools of the Carnegie Institute 
of Pittsburgh, which were founded on November 15, 
1900.......................... . .
The inception of these schools resulted from a 
visit Mr. Carnegie made to the Keighley (Yorks) 
Institute in September, 1900. Mrs. Carnegie distri
buted the prizes there to the successful winners 
among 1,2GG competitors. In taking part in this 
function, her husband referred to an article written 
by his grandfather in Cobbetts Weekly Political 
Register (1802-1835), entitled, Handiflcation versus 
Headifieation, in which the grandfather thanked 
God that in his youth he had learnt how to make 
and mend shoes. It is gratifying to learn that Great 
Britain has had some influence in stimulating the 
advance of technology in America,
It is remarkable that the Press of this country 
glories in bewailing the imaginary backwardness 
of its own country, and that this national deprecia
tion is even heard within the walls of Wesminster 
Palace. We have no reason to lament the progress 
of technology at home. It has not been so liberal 
or so wide-reaching as in America, but Government 
and municipal authorities have been by no means 
niggardly all over the country. Indeed our Govern
ment allocates about 1,000,000 pounds per annum 
of the drink taxes to this purpose. Our complaint 
is that the wealth of our fortunate citizens does not 
flow freely in the direction of educational endow
ments. Notwithstanding persistent, and sometimes 
undignified begging, our ancient universities them
selves are sadly checked in modern progress by the 
want of funds and of patriotism in their alumni.
It is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to 
obtain accurate statistics to determine the relative 
amounts of the immense sums of money bequeathed 
and contributed to religion, charity, hospitals, and 
education in the United Kingdom. In London alone 
it was over 10,000,000 pounds in 1906, but of this 
only 123,778 pounds was allocated to education. The 
total amount over the whole country must have ex
ceeded 50,000,000 pounds, and of this probably only 
one per cent, was devoted to education! Distribu
tion of wealth is much a matter of fashion, and for 
some unaccountable reason education is tabooed. 
Very recently Cambridge and Manchester have bene
fited largely, but this was accidental in the one case, 
and only a fraction of the immense sums left by 
Mrs. Rylands in the second case. In America it is 
not so much by legacy that wealth is bestowed, as 
by the living millionaire, who, perhaps,, derives the 
greatest joy and satisfaction from his munificence, 
in distributing his surplus wealth for the good of 
others.
The type of educationthe mental preparation 
for practical lifelin their technical schools, has 
been designed to meet the local, economic, and indus
trial needs of Pittsburgh. They form at present, in 
their noviciate stage, more a trade school than a 
college of technology, but they have a great future 
(before them, and they will probably grow into a 
well co-ordinated academic system embracing all 
branches of preparation. I have always defined 
technical education to be that form of teaching 
which trains the brain to assist the hands. This 
definition may now be extended to embrace the sen
ses, and especially to that of sight, and even that of 
touch. Like science itself it also develops the per
ception of truth. It means the addition of thought, 
reason, and judgment to mere manual craft. It ex
cites the reason why for every operation. Adopt

ing Mr. Carnegies grandfathers terms, it is handification plus headification. Every industry is based 
on natural facts, and the most successful workman 
is he who is able to apply the facts of nature, and the 
dictates of common sense, which is science, to pro
duce the greatest economical effect from the least 
expenditure of energy by sensuous, manual, or mechancal operations. Hence technical education 
means an economical advance upon general educa
tion, and is supplementary to ordinary board or 
public school tuition.
There are numerous discordant variations of 
industry in all great manufacturing centres which 
employ different classes of students. This demands 
specialisation for their various callings. Each cen
tre has more or less to provide for its own wants. 
It has to regard the people of both sexes and the 
industries and occupations which make them bread
winners.
We must brush aside all questions of general 
education and of sex, and assume that we are deal
ing with those who have at least passed through 
a fair education of a primary character and can pass 
a moderate entrance examination. They must be 
prepared to grasp the meaning of the facts and prin
ciples which lie at the root of the business in life 
that is going to enable them to earn a living and 
to make them experts.
Culture is never neglected in America. An 
eminent scholar said to me, In the university there 
should be 90 per cent, humanities, and 10 per cent, 
technology. In the technological college, 90 per cent, 
technics, and 10 per cent, humanities.
The Americans have the practice, in all their 
commercial and scholastic undertakings, of placing 
the chief executive power in the hands of one com
petent authority, who is entrusted with great per
sonal power and responsibility, and who is selected 
with great care. I have been brought in contact 
with many of these Presidents and Directors, and
I have been greatly impressed with the marked 
success that has characterised their selection. I 
have failed to fathom the process. Heads of uni
versities, telegraphs, telephones, railways, electric 
light and power companies, manufactories and dis
tributing agencies have all in my experience been 
the right men in the right places, and they have 
been successful autocrats. This is one great feature 
of American success, not only in financial but in 
educational movements. It is eminently so in the 
technical schools, and markedly so in the case of 
the Director of the Carnegie Institute Technical 
Schools, who recently passed through London, and 
who impressed every one with whom he was brought 
in contact, not only with the breadth of his views, 
but with his mastery of details.
It is satisfactory to find that games and social 
functions are not neglected. We were each of us 
presented with a copy of The Thistle, an annual 
record of student life, and of base-ball, foot-ball, 
athletics, hockey, &c., events. It is admirably writ
ten, sparkling with American wit, and full of inter
esting information. The students cheer in America 
is peculiar. The line from the Schenley Hotel, 
whence we processed to the Carnegie Institute, was 
lined with students who shouted in stentorian unison 
as we passed
C.A.R.N.E.G.I.E.C.A.R.N.E.G.I.E.
Rah! Rah! Rah!
Tech.
Clubs and Societies are being formed in the 
schools to encourage music, literary and engineering 
discussions, &c. Every effort is made to aid the in
terchange of ideas and the development of wide 
views of life. Home life is not neglected, and hous
es are eqiupped for the use of those whose homes 
are at a distance from Pittsburgh. Room and board 
is extremely moderate. Everything indicates the 
birth of the true college spirit and the foundation of 
a strong university esprit de corpa

How do you feel after the shuffle? Somewhat 
of a change around. The most noticeable and re
grettable change is the absence of the assembly in 
the mornings for general lectures, which provided 
a means of seeing every one every day and of hold
ing meetings and making announcements of a gen
eral nature. Queer as this may be, much queerer 
will be the next change; that of next year. With 
the courses separate, much more difficult will be the 
task of obtaining general opinion and sentiment on 
anything.
Is is a pity there is no way ito keep the old crowd 
together, even if it were only for one or two periods 
a week. The more one sees of the rest of the class 
and school the better in more ways than one. The 
last and greatest dividing, the final one, will surely 
find us so closely bound together that for all the scat
tering the tie will always be felt. Its the thing that 
will endure the longest, and be the firmest and best. 
What is more lasting or more noble than a true 
friendship ?

RELAY FINALS ARE HELD.
At the finals on the oval Tuesday of last term, 
the relay team which goes to Philadelphia was finally 
decided. Halferty won with Ross second, and Dowl
ing third. Hatcher and Charles tied for fourth place, 
but will probably go. Some doubt exists as to 
whether Halferty will be able to make the trip on 
account of deficiency in studies, but he hopes to 
make up his lost standing in time. We all hope he 
will, as he should prove a winner when it comes to 
the final test.

PAST AND PRESENT.
He told us a tale of loyalty
A tale of heroes brave
Of men who fought, and men who died
Their land, and homes, to save.
He read us a legend of long ago,
When knights were fierce and bold;
When it was man to man, and sword to sword, 
And life, was to have, and to hold.
Then he spun us a yard of the wild Northmen, 
Who roved oer the unknown seas,
Who knew God; feared no man,
And lived, like a wandering breeze.
But the yarn, I liked the best of all,
Was a tale of a modern lad;
He was a student; hero; man,
And wore a Tartan plaid.
Tech was the banner he unfurled
Red, yellow, green, and blue
The emblem of one spot on earth,
Where every man is true.

On the closing Friday of school Miss Smith 
kindly turned over the Gym. for dancing from 3.30 
to 5.30 P. M. and from 9.30 to 11 P. M. Many stu
dents attended the dance given by the day girls and 
all classes of the boys schools were represented. 
The girls were much pleased to see so many Plebes 
and Industrials in attendance, as this was one of 
their few chances to mingle with the other classes 
on an equal footing. The floor was xather crowded, 
but everybody present had such a good time that 
the music could not be heard at times for laughter.
The dance given by the night girls was not so 
well attended, but Miss Smith succeeded in break
ing the ice for so many that the floor was soon
crowded, and dancing was continued until the lights
were winked.
The picture of the M. M. C. S. ball team, which
was taken for the Thistle, is a g>od one.
The dance this evening bids fair to outshine any 
similar efforts since the school began. It is purely 
a leap year affair, the girls even intend to furnish 
flowers and bon-bons for the gentlemen, it is ru
mored.
ENGAGED TO MARRY.
The following article was clipped from the 
Monroe County Republican, printed at Woodsfield, 
Ohio:
Prominent among the society announcements 
in the Columbus daily papers a few days ago was 
Mrs. Belle Everetts announcement of the engage
ment of her charming young daughter Lydia, to Mr. 
Elmer Schumacher, of this place. Some of the 
dailies embellished their announcements with por
traits of the happy young couple in true metropoli
tan style. Miss Everett is a sister of Mrs. (Dr.) 
W. W. Scales of this place, and is well known here, 
where she has frequently visited. She is a gradu
ate of the Columbus North High Street School, class 
of 06, a member of Alpha Delta Theta Sorority, and 
moves in the best of society. Mr. Schumacher is a 
son of L. Schumacher of this place, and is taking 
the mechanical engineering course in the Carnegie 
Technical School of Pittsburg, where he is a mem
ber of the Sigma Tau Fraternity. The marriage of 
these popular young people will be an event of the 
summer to which their friends will look forward 
with interest.

THE BASE-BALL TEAM.
It is rather unusual to publish articles calling 
attention to an athletic teams failure to win so early 
in the season; but we find ourselves now after only 
two games have been played, asking ourselves how 
badly were we beaten instead of did we win. The 
mere fact of losing a game or so, would not be suf
ficient to cause this state of affairs if the scores were 
small, but when the amount is of such proportions 
that a dispute actually occurs among members of 
the team as to the exact score, they having lost 
track of the tally as it kept increasing, it is time 
to do something more than take notice.
When Tech lost Wills she lost a pitcher that 
stood in a class by himself among college pitchers 
in this locality. His loss alone can not explain the 
worse than poor showing to date except in that it 
has tended to destroy the confidence of the other 
men. The remainder of the team should be stronger 
if anything than last year as in most cases the posi
tions are held down by a member of last years team 
or by some one considered enough better to displace 
him.
In explanation cf the teams shortcomings there 
are as many theories advanced as there are base ball 
theorists in school, and their number approaches the 
enrollment of the schools as a limit. There have 
been some unkind enough to suggest favoritism in 
the selection of the members of the team and their 
assignment to places. To one who realizes how 
easily insinuations of this character assume the pro
portions of ugly rumor this theory doesnt appeal 
especially when the observer knows the trouble 
Captain Halferty has taken to get everybody out to 
try for the team that had ever attempted to play 
ball. As we said before, the loss of Wills was a 
serious blow, but aside from that it is necessary in 
order to win games to not only keep the other fellow 
from hitting the ball, but also to make a safe but 
occasionally yourself. The failure of oifr team to 
do this so far can only be attributed to stage fright 
or lack of a batting eye. The latter can be acquired 
it is said or can at least be improved, the former is 
inexcusable. The pitchers alone can not be to b'ame 
for the large scores run up against us as with proper 
fielding a great many otherwise safe hits can be 
turned into outs. Up to date our team has not done 
itself proud in this department of the game. Poor 
fielding can be attributed to four causes: inability 
of the man to play the game, lack of practice, poor 
coaching, or lack of team work. The first we dis
miss without comment, as we believe that for the 
most part we have the right men. The second 
seems within the power of the team to rectify. The 
third seems highly improbable, as we have the same 
coach that turned out a winning team last year. 
The last then would seem to be the explanation, and 
if it is the Captain and others of the team should, in 
the words of the immortal Basset, Get busy.

METALLURGISTS TRIP OF INSPECTION.
The students of the Senior Class Department 
of Metallurgy had an interesting and instructive 
trip during the Easter recess which took in points 
in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland and New 
York. The party left Pittsburgh on the Friday night 
at the close of the winter term and journeyed direct 
to Philadelphia, thence to Washington, where a por
tion of the party made a side tour to Baltimore. 
From Washington the students visited the large 
copper refining works at Perth Amboy and Chrome 
and visits to all the metalliferous plants in eastern 
New Jersey were made. The party reached New 
York City on Wednesday evening and the re
mainder of the week was spent in visiting the points 
of interest in and around the metropolis.
Prof. Crabtree accompanied the boys on the en
tire trip, and Prof. James accompanied the Chemical 
Engineers who were in the party for the first two 
days.

a notable array of speakers, among whom are our 
president, our advisor and the 1912 basket-ball star 
who can sing in the Glee Club, play basket-ball, play 
hockey, take an interest in class affairs, speak elo
quentlyand yet maintain a high standard in his 
studies. Prof. Hokanson and J. H. Leete have also 
kindly consented to give us a short address. Mr. 
Frayer, who sets the pace in Mathematics, will also 
talknot on Trigonometry or any other oniometry, 
however. Mr. McTurk, the elocutionist of Section
D, will give us some advicethat is, maybe it will 
be advice. Mr. Ryman and Mr. Hindman will repre
sent their respective sections and endeavor to create 
a laugh or two.
And there you are. The oratory, an the eatins, 
an the music, an the stories, and we wont get 
home until morning.* * * *
Will some one kindly, but gently (very gently) 
inform Mister Skeehan that he must attend to his 
duties as marshall or he will lose his job. And jobs 
are scarce these days, too, Regis.* * * #
SkeehanWhat is that you are giving out,
Helm?
HelmThat is the receipt I am going to give 
Maisch for his banquet money. Dont you want
one?
SkeehanNo, I guess not. ImImwell, Im

Richards threatens to leave school because his 
bridge pass is now stamped Night Only. He says,

McCowen wishes all the base-ball players of 
the class to appear for practice Wednesday evening, 
at which time a captain will be elected.
* * * *
SkeehanNewell, youre quite a fusser; do 
you know it? I honestly believe that if you were a 
hearse driver all the fair bits of feminimity would 
be dying to get. in it.
NewellHowhowwhawhats that?
When Dry Cleaning is done properly you can't 
help but be satisfied. See SHUMAN, at 3911 Forbes, 
near Boquet. Give him a sample order.
Wonder who that tall girl is with whom Crosby 
strolls up Fifth avenue at noon every day of the 
week. Does she ever ask how the weather is down 
below, Crosby?
Heard in the Library.
McLaughlinSay, Maisch, where in the name 
of sense did you get that hair-cut? Thats a new 
one, isnt it?
Maisch (carelessly)Oh, that is a hair-cut a 
la mode.
McLaughlinGee whiz, fellows, no wonder Im 
sleepy; I never got home until 2.30 this morn.
SkeehanWhy, what was the matter?
McLaughlinOh, d - - n it, it wasnt my fault.
I was out calling, and couldnt get away; somebody 
was holding me down.
SkeehanIf a milkmaid were kicked by a cow, 
what would you call it?
CrosbyOh, shut up; I dont know. You make 
me tired with your old, dry jokes, anyway.
SkeehanWhy, a milk-strike.
And he laughed.
The banquet is to be held tomorrow evening and 
Prince and Mac will not be there.
How sad!
Dan Griffith appears very much perplexed and 
absent-minded. Have you noticed it? Brother Dan 
has just passed his twenty-first birthday and we are 
wondering whether it is the eternal feminine ques
tion or whether he is merely trying to decide upon 
whom he will bestow his vote at the coming presi
dential election.
When our opponents stoop to the depths of the 
ditch to fling pitch, we must retire, lest we too be
come contaminated, etc., etc.
Oh! Horrors!
We are glad to see you back, Weller, after your 
long vacation. Mr. Weller is first violinist of the

It is to be hoped that the base-ball public is duly 
impressed with the speed and caliber of the 1912 
class local ball team, as a result of the note in the 
Dispatch, Thursday morning, April 16, 08. The note 
was of such a nature as readers of the sporting page 
will recognize as typical of a great class of teams 
whose sole existence is on paper and who are, by 
the way, champions before the season has been 
under way ten days.
The writer of said note is guilty of a gross 
breach of college ethics, as the ideal college mans 
loyalty increases as the fortunes of the Varsity nine 
multiply instead of drawing an odious comparison 
with a hypothetical team of superlatively verdant 
freshies.
No doubt the appearance of the note was the 
unauthorized act of some overzealous chap who in 
his narrow way thinks to boost his class team by 
assailing the Varsity.
That this ambitious writer has not the support 
of his class the Tartan feels confident and the inci
dent will be credited to an irresponsible individual 
rather than to a class which has really shown spirit 
unusual in one so young.* * * *
President Elliott of Harvard University, will de

12THE TARTAN
NINETEEN ELEVEN
A. F. Stamm, Editor.
The vitriolic attack of the editor of the Valve 
World on the president and class of 1911 of the Car
negie Tech Schools is further evidence of the fact 
that R. T. Crane and his paid underlings know not 
whereof they speak.
The position of the editor of this publication 
and that of the president of 1911 are very nearly 
identical in that each is a beneficiary under the 
generosity of a wealthy patron and that it involves 
upon them to defend any attack upon their respec
tive benefactors. There is a slight difference, how
ever, in that the former is called upon to defend his 
employer from the result of his own folly in making 
statements which he can not substantiate, while 
the latter wielding a less able pen, showed by a sin
gle act the contempt he felt for the traducer of the 
man he is in gratitude and honor bound (not paid) 
to defend.* * * *
It is very nice of 1910 to put a coat of sugar on 
the dirty pill they handed to 11 and 12 in the last 
issue of the Tartan. With the aid of the statement 
that no further reference will be made to 1911 and 
1912, their sewer talk is made a little easier to 
swallow.
Their retirement ujider fire after allowing them
selves the last word shows the masterly (?) manner 
in which they can conduct a duel of wits. Were it 
not for defiling the plaid of which yellow is one of 
the colors, the writer will refrain from stating the 
color they showed in the little tilt. By calling it 
lemon will they understand?
* * * *
1911 voted to hold a smoker before school closes, 
but the social committee went on a strike, using 
as an argument that if the men will not come to a 
free blow they will not be likely to fancy a pay-asyou-enter stunt.* * * *
He (at the dance)Put that wing down; it is

I received five hundred dollars damages for 
injuries received in a trolley wreck.
Were you hurt very much?
Well, I lost fifteen pounds as a result.
I guess that cost the railway company more 
than the current price of beef, didnt it?

ation one bit.
No? You ought to be glad I did not say pork.

C. B. Kline, the energetic secretary of 1911, is 
still suffering from an attack of cerebro-spinal-mengitis. It is the earnest hope of his class mates that 
he will have a speedy and permanent recovery, and 
that the loss of time will not throw him back in his 
studies so that he will be lost to 1911. Mr. Kline 
has been singularly unfortunate this year, having 
had several sieges of illness, in spite of which, how---------------------------------------------------

THE TARTAN
ever, he was able to maintain a satisfactory standing 
in class.* * * *
It is a pity, indeed, that the Senior night class 
will persist in defacing the columns of the Tartan 
with such putrid English as One dont feel at home 
and an interclass controversy between three parti
cipants.
Exponents of such bad English ought to talk 
about descending to the sewer for ammunition in 
an interclass controversy.
It is no wonder Prof. MacLucas, LL.D., (long 
lanky d  1) left rchcol when he turned out and 
passed such English students as the senior nocturn
als.* * * *
On the evening of April 8th, the class of 1911 
held their last regular class meeting for the school 
year of 1907-08. In order to stimulate a little more 
interest and to have as large an attendance as possi
ble, the live social committee furnished stogies and 
tobacco, and while the business was being discussed 
an informal smoker was held.
The only things of any moment which were 
taken up were the discussion on ways and means 
to re-imburse the social committee for the funds 
they put into the treasury to make up the deficit 
incurred at the banquet, and a recommendation to 
the athletic committee to take the initiative in the 
organization of a base-ball team of night men of any 
class to play Saturday afternoon games throughout 
the summer on the Tech grounds if same are obtain
able or on the campus if the enclosed grounds are 
leased to visitors.
The athletic committee will interview the fac
ulty at an early date and report at a special meeting 
to be called early next week.

PROGRESS OF THE NEW BUILDINGS.
A large force of men is at work building a new 
JiCist to replace the one which was blown down 
about two weeks ago. The new one Is of a different 
and stronger design than the old one and will be 
used to hoist concrete for the roof, the forms for 
which are already in place. Brick laying will start 
very soon, as fast as the material can be received. 
The contract for the electrical work has not yet been 
let, but should be very soon. On account of a strike 
in the union electrical workers ranks, this branch 
of the of the work has been somewhat hampered in 
the past.

TRACK ATHLETICS.
Upon Saturday next, April 25th, the track 
season will practically open, so far as Carnegie 
Tech is concerned; at which time the Univer
sity of Pennsylvania gives its annual Relay 
Carnival. Something like 170 colleges and 
schools will have teams there to compete for 
honors, and amongst them will be a team from 
our school, from 'whom we expect a very favor
able showing. At the present time our men 
are doing, in practice, much better time than 
that in which the event of their class was won 
last year, and with the time still remaining for 
practice, and the fact that the cinder-path at 
Franklin Field is much faster than the track 
where the men are running at present, it is 
but a fair presumption that we stand more than 
an even chance of winning first honor. Carne
gie Tech is entered with Westminster, Wash
ington and Jefferson, Western Univ., of Penna. 
Villa Nova, St. Johns (Fordham), and Univer
sity of Louisville.
Upon May 16th, we give a dual meet with 
Western Univ. of Penna., and the following 
Saturday compete in the intercollegiate meet 
given by the Western Univ. of Penna.
Upon June 6th, the Intercollegiate League 
of Western Pennsylvania holds a meet at Conneaut Lake, to which Carnegie Tech will send 
a representative team.
Two further possibilities are thp State In
tercollegiate meet at Harrisburg upon May 30, 
and a dual meet with State at State College, 
during commencement week.
Last year Carngie Tech made a very cred
itable showing with its track team, and from 
the present outlook, chances seem exceedingly 
favorable for greater honors coming our way, 
and, with the interest that seems to be existent 
in track athletics this year, even greater things 
may be looked for, since the success of any 
branch of college athletics seems to be directly 
proportional to the interest shown in them by 
the student body. With this last thought in 
mind, let each and every student of this insti
tution, make a vow that he will do nothing but 
boost anything and everything pertaining to 
that most admirable of sportsThe Track.

ATHLETIC FIELD.
Work has begun in earnest on the new Athletic 
Field, and on May 2, the scheduled date of the W. & 
J. game, the ground will have been put in shape, the 
grandstand erected and the fence built. Mr. Leeds 
has been put in immediate charge of affairs pertain
ing to the field and the student body may feel con
fident that with him directing, the work will be 
pushed forward with all possible speed.

THE TARTAN15
CO-OPERATION.
The strength of unity is indisputable. Few 
things do more to retard the natural progress of a 
business or a movement than a lack of intelligent 
co-operation.
The energy expended on a tug of war is not 
constructive energy. It is like one man pumping 
water out of a basin while another pumps it back.
There are two chief reasons for a lack of co
operation: One is that men do not agree on what
is best to be done. The other is that selfish motives 
deceive men into thinking that thy can get more by 
going alone.
The remedy for the first is comparison of views, 
exchange of ideas, and the establishment of the right 
idea in the minds of all. The remedy for the second 
is the knowledge that the common good is also the 
real good of the individual. Selfishness is often an
other name for ignorance. If a man desires to ob
tain the most good for himself he should know that 
his legitimate share of a good common good is 
greater than any possible good he could obtain for 
himself alone. The narrow-minded man fishes with 
p. hook and thinks to have the whole catch for him
self. The broad-minded man joins with others in 
using a seineand his portion of the catch exceeds 
by far what he might get with the hook.
Co-operation is the most effective way to secure 
the most of what each one desires to obtain.Waldo 
Ponday Warren, in Selling Magazine.

A SERIES OF INTERESTING TESTS.
The Pittsburg Testing Laboratory has taken the 
contract to test the power plant at Ross station, on 
the Allegheny river. At the earnest request of Prof. 
Trinks students are to make these tests under the 
direction of instructors in the Mechanical Depart
ment. The first of this series took place last Friday 
night and Saturday from 4 P. M. to 4 P. M., making 
a 24 hours test. Members of the Senior Mechani
cals and Junior Mechanicals helped in the work. 
One boiler was completed and the next was tested 
Tuesday and last night. There are eight boilers in 
all and four pumping engines as well as the acces
sories to be tested. It is expected that the work 
will cover a period of six weeks, and the students 
taking part will derive great benefit from the work.
