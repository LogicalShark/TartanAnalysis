LE GORE STARS FOR YALE
Last Saturday Carnegie Tech 
opened its football season and made 
its debut in what is considered to be 
Teal eastern football. The much, 
touted Yale eleven, eighteen pounds 
to the man heavier than Tech, with
a. squad consisting of one hundred as
pirants for the much coveted Y, 
coached by eight football artists of 
undoubted calibre, were able to down 
.the Tech team after much real exer
tion and chiefly through the efforts of 
one, presumably Frenchman, by the 
name of LeGore.
The crippled Tech eleven, rendered 
much less effective on both the of.- 
lense and defense by the loss of 
Altdoerfer, Marshall and McFeaters, 
fought the Yale eleven for every inch 
of ground, contested stubbornly every 
gain and setback, and made a show
ing which is not shown by the score 
.>of 25 to 0. Although scored, on in al
most the first minute of play by a 
brilliant run of 45 yards by LeGore, 
rthe plaid came back, not only came 
back but outplayed the Eli team in the 
second quarter, in which stage of the 
contest Nig Finley and Kesner feat
ured with 35 and 25 yard gains re
spectively. Here Tech showed some 
of the form which gave the Case en
gineers such a jolt last year.
Although Yale hit the line for good 
gains at times, there was no certainty

MANY FACULTY ARE PRESENT
The upper and middle classes of 
the School of Applied Industries ten
dered a reception and smoker to the 
Industries Plebes last Friday evening 
:in the gymnasium.
Acting President Hoxworth of the 
Senior class filled the position of 
master, of ceremonies, and his address 
of welcome to the new men was fol
lowed by short talks from Messrs. 
Koontz, Baird, Kingsbury, Hall, Dun.seith and Roth.
The entertainment consisted of a 
tumbling and acrobatic act by Fink, 
a barrel-tilting contest with Levin 
and J. L. Carroll the contestants, 
magic by the mysterious Gladstein, a 
swatting contest between Levin, Lu.gen, Morris and Miller, vocal selec
tions by Baron and Civil'ett, two Sci
ence Plebes, who very kindly loaned 
their services for the occasion, and 
music by Hoxworth. 0 course there 
were smokes and eats in abundance.
A pleasing feature of the affair was 
the presence of so many of the fac
ility, and had it not been for the in
terviews with the night school stu
dents scheduled for that evening, more 
of the faculty would have been pres
ent. Among the members of the fac
ility present were: Prof. Lee, Mr.
Macfcaeek, Mr. Kelley, Mr. Dosey, Mr.

The first regular meeting of the 
year of the Student Assembly of the 
School of Applied Industries took 
place last Wednesday in Room 104.
J. Russell Hoxworth, 17, was elect
ed Assembly Vice President to fill the 
vacancy left by Jack Downes, who 
has transferred to night school.
The new system of elections, as 
proposed by The Tartan, was unan
imously adopted. The various activi

FIRST HOME GAME OF SEASON
Tech opens its home season Satur
day with the strong Bethany College 
aggregation. This will be the first of 
four consecutive games at home be
fore the team goes to Cornell on No
vember 4 th.
Little is known of Bethany this year 
except for the W. & J. game, and if 
that is any indication of their brand 
of football Saturdays game should be 
a real one. The Bethany team has 
been coached this year by Heyman, 
who was for several years a brilliant 
end on W. & J.s team. He was a 
master of the open game, one of the 
best punters in the country and a 
wonderful handler of the forward 
pass. This leads to the belief that 
Bethanys offense will consist of a 
varied assortment of open plays.
The prospects at the West Virginia 
institution are unusually bright this 
season, as they have a fine line and 
exceptional back field material. Ran
ey, right end, and Dunn, right guard, 
have played with W. & J. and are 
both stars. Tylock plays the left end 
position well, and with Raney the ter
minal points are sure to be well taken 
care of. Bergan and Hepburn at 
tackle, Kenedy and Dunn at guard and 
Rider at center form a steady but fast 
line which will be well worth watch
ing.
Bethany is said to have a back 
field better than ever before. Elder 
at fullback hits the line hard and also 
is a punter of no mean ability. Ros
enberg and Goodyear, right and left 
halfbacks, are sure tj prove trouble
some to their opponents, and Artman 
at quarter may be trusted to use his 
men with judgment.
The game on Saturday is bound +o 
be close and interesting. Bethany is 
coming up here with the sole object

WILLIAM POEL IS HERE 
FOR THREE WEEKS
William Poel of London, founder 
and director of the Elizabethan Stage 
Society, has arrived in Pittsburgh for 
the purpose of filling a three weeks 
engagement at Tech, where he Is. to 
coach the students of the Department 
of Drama of the School of. Applied 
Design in a classic production of Ben 
Jonsons The Poetaster. Mr. Poel 
will make his production of Jonsons 
play in the Elizabethan manner with
out scenery and in the costumes of 
the period. He lias made this pro: 
duction several times for. the Eliza
bethan Stage Society in London, and 
has brought over with him all the 
costumes and properties which he 
used in his London performances.
Mr. Poel spent three weeks here 
last spring, where he directed the stu
dents in a reading of Calderon's 
"Lifes a Dream, and gave a series 
of interpretive readings of Shake
speares plays. He was also the com
mencement speaker at the eleventh 
annual commencement exrcises in 
Carnegie Hall.
Officers to be Chosen by Mew 
Election Plan
The School of Applied Design 
passed the plan for the studont elec
tions as proposed by* The Tartan 
in the first meeting of the yoar. 
Nominations for the difforont offices 
were held and are given above. As 
was stated in a previous Issue of 
this paper, an outline of the qualifi
cations and duties, of the ofllcors to 
be elected Is given.
The President of Design School Is 
by far the most important office in 
the school. He stands for and repre
sents the student; -body. Ho must 
have, to a certain extent, an Influence 
over the students. He must have a 
strong personality and bo a good 
mixer. Ho will bo in charge of the 
Design Ball, and this, In Itsolf, is no 
moan job. The President, Is also 
called upon during tlio year to meet 
and escort many .persons of note that, 
come/to visit the school. \The First 
.Vice President assists tlio President 
and acts in his absence. Tlio Second 
Vice President represents the women 
of. the school. She must be a good ox-, 
ocutlve, able to handle social func
tions and must; have tlio interests of 
the school at heart. The Secretary's 
duty is to make rocords of all meet
ings of the school and reports of all 
committees. I-Ie should be exact, 
careful and ta,ko an interest in his 
work. The Treasurer handles all the 
money of the student body and assists 
in maintaining the Student Fund. He 
must be trustworthy and have a 
knowledge of bookkeeping and bank
ing. The duty of the Tyler is to In
form all the students of all meetings. 
It is his business to see that all the 
students know far enough in advance 
of any school meeting. The His
torian must be somewhat of a literary 
person, inasmuch as he chronicles all 
events of the school. This is a re
sponsible position and requires some 
work.

Work Immediately
MEN ARE SHOWING INTEREST
Last week meetings wore hold in 
each of the dormitories and men 
nominated for election to tlio Govern
ing Board. One man Is to bo elected 
from oacli floor In each dormitory. 
This board is ,as Its name implies, a 
board to govern the affairs of the Car

NEW APPROACH
TO TECH CAMPUS
Across tlio road at tlio ^oft of De
sign School Is a very steep embank
ment:. A large flight of stops has 
been built down tills 'embankment, a 
board walk extended across the hol
low and another flight of steps up 
the opposite bank. In all, more than 
900 steps and llvo hundred feet of 
board walk have been built to ac
commodate those students residing 
near Morewood, Aiken and Fifth av
enues and the East End.
Until the present time students 
from the sections mentioned have 
either walked all the way around the 
Institute and across the bridge or 
have plodded through the muddy soil 
across the "hollow to attend their 
clases. This was particularly true of 
Margaret Morrison girls who wished 
to save a long walk. Now all this is 
obviated. One end of the new ap-1

Dean Leote for the Institute, and Mr. 
McCorkle for the Alumni Association.
The names of the winners of eleven 
scholarships were, announced and the 
results of the competition set by the 
Engineers Society of Western Penn

took all the places possible, winning 
eleven out of thirteen.

TECH SPIRIT.
On April third, Nineteen hun
dred and five, the first material 
steps were taken to build up one 
of the greatest institutions that 
not only Pennsylvania, not only 
the East, but yes, even one of the 
greatest institutions that tho coun
try.has ever seen. Ten years have 
elapsed1. Today Tech is the largest 
engineering school in tho state; 
tho largest industrial school; 
ranks fourth in number among 
the colleges for women in tho 
state, and as a design school ranks 
with any in the country.
Thoso are facts. No school has 
over attained such ronmrkable 
laurels, nor made such phenome
nal strides ill its first ton yoars of 
existence, Why? How has this 
been brought about?
I, When our Unde Andy first 
 , conceived tho idoa ol! Tocli, such 
I trustees were choson whoso aim 
;! was to aid mankind, to further the 
i! higher ideals, to lend a helping 
" hand to the honest seeker ol! that 
j! f knowledge which prepares for a 
!] greater sueeess in lifes struggle, 
a and whoso heart was in the 
*SiworIc. Can a higher tribute than 
|Hhis bo bestowed? No I But all 
these ideals may be summed up in 
Wo 11C words, Tech Spirit.
Goods fis the Tech Spirit that really

in the worthiness of your ideals, 
in your activities about school, or 
in the support of such. activities' 
which have as their primary ob
ject the promotion and advance

Spirit.

every Tech student as a brother or

a word of advice well placed, or 
a tone of encouragement to tide 
over the darker hours; and sounds

ECONOMIC SOCIETY LAYS 
PLANS FOR YEAR
The work o the C. I. T. Economic 
Society for the present year is planned 
a somewhat different basis than 
that of last year. Besides the usual 
lectures by men of note, it is planned 
to provide for a regular study hour. 
This study hour is to allow for a more 
minute consideration of economic prob
lems' of the day. Part of the time is 
to be alloted to discussions of lectures 
and to the discussion of views held 
by members of the society. As in the 
past, it will be the policy of the or
ganization to foster a free and liberal 
attitude toward any subject either di
rectly or remotely connected with 
questions of economics, and more es
pecially those topics involving social
ism.
It is hoped that students will avail 
themselves of the opportunity to take 
an active part in discussions of vital 
interest to every citizen. The mem
bership fee is one dollar for the sea
son and entitles members to full priv
ileges. Membership is open tol male 
and female, faculty and students of 
any of the foui* schools. Announce
ments. of meetings and leaders will 
appear in The Tartan. For detailed 
information, consult A. H. Schultz, In
dustriesTeachers Course; H. Alpern, ScienceMecli. Irreg; or C. C. 
Greiner, ScienceSophomore. .
STUDENTS MEET DEATH 
DURING VACATION
Two night students of the School of 
Applied Industries met with untimely 
deaths while on their vacations dur
ing tho mon.lb of September.
William .T. Whitten, aged 19 years, 
while in bathing in Lake Erie, hit a 
sand bar and broke his back. He was 
burled from his home, 3452 Webster 
avenue, Pittsburgh. Whitten would 
have entered his third year in the 
Building TradeB Course this fall.
Raymond Kerr Elliott, aged 24 years, 
was drowned on Wednesday, Septem
ber 13, in the Clarion river, near Foxburg, Pa., where lie was spending his 
vacation. It is thought that he got 
beyond his depth. His brother, W. C. 
Elliott, Jr., a fourth year student in 
the Night Telephony Course, attempt
ed to reach him, but despite his efforts 
the body sank, but was soon recovered. 
The drowned student was a student in 
the Night Course in Printing. He was 
one of the first students to enter the 
department and an active member of 
the Grapliica. His father, W. C. Elliott, 
Sr., was an instructor in the Printing 
Course during the night school season 
of 1915-16.
HOUSE MEETING AND

NEW CLUB ROOMS
IN DESIGN SCHOOL
Dean Bossange has announced that 
tho Design School men were to have 
a club room similar to those in the 
Industries and Science Schools. The 
old modelling rooms in tho basoment

The Brisk SmokeBull Durham
When you see an alert-looking young man in a 
lively argument roll a Bull Durham cigaretteits 
the natural thing. He likes to punctuate a crisp 
sentence with a puff of Bull Durham. His mind 
responds to the freshness thats in the taste of it, and 
his senses are quickened by its unique aroma. A 
cigarette of Bull Durham just fits in with keen 
thinking and forceful action.

BOARD OF CONTROL AND 
STUDENT ACTIVITIES
Nominations Have Been 
Made to Fill Vacancies in 
These Boards
ELECTIONS HELD THIS WEEK
Graduate Manager Gearhart has 
had posted the blanks for nominations 
for the Board of Control of the Ath
letic Association and also for the Stu
dent Activities Board. These nomin
ations closed last Saturday at noon 
and. the list of nominees is given in 
this issue of The Tartan. The 
Board of Control has control over all 
athletic appointments and elections, 
and also of the awarding of the school 
insignia. The term of office of the 
representatives on the board is two ?*. 
years. The Student Activities Board 
has chafge of all non-athletic activi
ties and also has charge of the Stu
dent Activities Fund, which may be 
used to assist these non-athletic ac
tivities. The day representatives are 
elected for a term of two years. All 
others are elected for one year only.
As these two boards practically con
trol all of the student activities, it 
behooves every man to think care
fully before voting upon anyone to fill 
these offices. The first qualification 
that the man must have is a lively 
interest in all school matters. He 
should be connected in some way 
with school activities. The second 
qualification is that he be broad
minded, in that he will always look 
after the interests of Tech and not 
the interests of individual school, 
class, fraternity or himself. See if 
his motto is in school matters, Tech 
_ first. It cannot be said that in the 
past all the members of the boards 
have had that motto in mind. A few 
times the school interest has been 
thought of last and other interests 
first. That is one reason why The 
Tartan has advocated the new ruling 
in regard to elections. Let every man 
think well before voting and be sure 
that the right man is put in the right 
place.

At a meeting of the upper class of 
the School of Applied Industries held 
on September 26, the plan of elections 
recently proposed by The Tartan 
was unanimously adopted. Following 
out this new plan the nominations for 
the various offices were held. The 
nominees are given in this issue 
while a short outline of the duties 
of the offices follows:
It is the duty of the President to 
preside over all class meetings, to 
appoint various committees, to see 
that these committees carry out the 
work assigned to them, and to see 
that the class conducts itself, as befits 
any Senior class in the school. 1-Ie is 
a member of the Executive Commit
tee of the Student Assembly. He 
holds, next to the President of the 
Student Assembly, the most import
ant position among the students. He 
must be a man who is well known, 
respected, well liked and last, but 
not least, a good mixer.
The Vice President assists the 
President in his work, and in the ab
sence of the President, exercises the 
powers of that office. He carries as 
much responsibility as the President 
and must have the same qualifica
tions.
The duty of the Secretary is to 
keep a record of all proceedings of 
the class. The  Secretary must be 
careful and painstaking, loyal in per
formance of his duties and to his 
class. The Treasurer supervises the 
collections of all assessments, keeps 
the same, and pays all authorized 
orders. He must be trustworthy, 
careful, have a good business head, 
and above all, have some sort of a 
knowledge of bookkeeping.
The Assembly is divided into four 
departments, and members from each 
class are recommended to the As
sembly President for appointment in 
these departments. The Department 
of Athletics has one man from the 
upper classv This department ap
points captains and other officials of 
various athletic teams and handles 
all athletic communications. The 
man recommended should be con
nected with the school athletics, fair 
and a good judge of men. The De
partment of Club Room management 
has two members from the upper 
class. This department takes charge 
of the equipment of the student club 
room, and, when necessary, makes as
sessments for new property or alter
ations for it. The Department of Stu
dent Deportment has charge of all 
matters of student conduct. It en
forces the various rules for conduct 
around the school, and if necessary in
flicts punishment upon offenders. The 
upper class has three men in this de
partment. These men should be fairminded, respectful of the school rules 
and respected, not only by the stu
dents but also by the Faculty. The 
Department of Studen.t Organization 
has one member from the upper class. 
It encourages clubs and societies 
among the students, and when neces
sary helps in their maintenance. It 
also aids the various class organiza
tions. The members of this depart
ment should also be members of some 
of these societies and have executive 
ability.
Middle Class Offices.
The duties of the various officers 
of the middle class are practically the 
same as those of the upper class. 
I The middle class, however, has 
charge of the Plebes in the school,
that the Plebe regulations are obeyed. 
The President must see that the 
Plebes have the proper respect for 
the upper classmen and the Faculty. 
The officers of the middle class must 
see that none of. their men attempt 
to haze the Plebes. The members of 
the different departments have the 
same duties as those given above for 
the upper men. The only difference 
is that in the Department of Student 
Deportment the middle class has only 
two representatives.
The Plebe officers must be men Who 
have already shown the most interest 
in the affairs of the class and of the 
school. The President of the lower 
class has a big job ahead of him, for 
the men are new and they must be 
taught the way things are run at 
Tech. The President must be ,a good 
leader, far-sighted and command the 
respect of the men he has to lead. 
All the men holding office must have 
good judgment of their own and yet 
they must be willing to listen to the 
opinions of the upper classmen.
VALE FOOTBALL GAME 
PLAYED ON BLACKBOARD
School Had Direct Wire 
From Western UnionStu
dents Cheer
More than three hundred Techltes 
assembled in room 209 Science on 
Saturday afternoon to receive the 
Tech-Yale football- result. A diagram 
on the blackboard helped to make the 
plays clear. The plays were cheered 
enthusiastically by the men, led by 
Merrill, Kellerman and Shumaker.
It was the intention to  elect a 
cheer leader at this meeting by a 
vote 1 of the studonts. This was 
changed, however. Graduate Manag
er Gearhart announced that a com
mittee of two men from each school 
and two or three men from the Board 
of Control would watch the candi
dates at the Bethany game and elect 
one as head leader.
All three men have much pep. and 
whichever one is elected will be sure 
to have all the studonts with him.
TECH TEAM RETiriS 
AMID ROUSING CHEERS
Large Body of Students Meet 
Team at East Liberty
About two hundred and fifty stu
dents managed to crawl out of bed 
early enough to greet the team at 
East I Liberty on Monday morning. 
The train for New York arrived 
about an hour late, and during the 
wait the men, under the leadership of 
Red Merrill, got their vocal chords 
well loosened up. When the train did 
arrive, however, it was greeted with a 
cannon ball that woke up three 
Pullman cars. The men lined up and 
made the team run the gauntlet.
TWO INDUSTRIES MEN 
ON THE SICK LIST
W. J. Miller of Old Forge, N. Y., a 
middle building construction man, un
derwent a minor operation at St.
I Francis Hospital last Friday morning. 
He expects to return to school in

the B-l section of the lower class, has 
not/been able to take up his studies

.BOSSANGE 
HOLD RECEPTION
The corridors and foyer of the De
sign School were alive with music and 
merrymakers last night for the first 
time this year, when Dean and Mrs. 
Bossange entertained the faculty and 
members of the Design School in 
honor of the Plebe class.
The occasion furnished an oppor
tunity for the upper classmen and the 
Freshmen to come into social contact 
with one another for the first time 
this season.
Nirellas orchestra furnished tlie 
music for excellent dancing, while 
cakes and light punch served for re
freshments.
Chaperones for the occasion were 
Mr. and Mrs. Bossange, Miss Bennett, 
Mr. and Mrs. Tarbell and Mr. and 
Mrs. Sparks.
A rather novel method of introduc
tion for the Plebo boys and girls, 
known as A Thousand Mile Walk, 
was arranged Friday afternoon, when 
all the boys were placed in lino op
posite the girls. The lines then moved 
in opposite directions while each fel
low introduced himself to the girl op
posite until the lines had completely 
passed and every one had become ac
quainted.
MUSICAL CLUB
TRY-OUT HELD
The activities of. tho Musical Clubs 
for tlio coming year began with the 
tryouts of now men in the Union on

For the benefit of thoso who wore

. of winning and making up for last 
year's defeat. However, they may 
have a hard time to do this, but it 
will sure be a fight up to the last 
whistle.
The following men of the 1916 
class, who are employed in and about 
the city, have enrolled in Industries 
night school: W. Geib, R. D. Junkins, R. W. Cost, H. E. Fox, H. Stead
man, A. C. Beck and D. R. Koontz.
NEW APPROACH
TO TECH CAMPUS
and it is up to the President to see
(Continued From Page One.) 
proach is at the sidewalk between Sci
ence and M. M. C. .S., the other end 
crosses the McGinley property, en
tering at Forbes street near Morewood avenue. It is needless to say 
that the new entrance means a sav
ing of time and effort for a great 
number of students who have hereto
fore walked a long distance each 
morning and nght. The steps ar& 
strongly built and have a strong rail
ing the entire .length for the conveni
ence of those climbing. It is expect
ed that night students will also use 
the new entrance, and for this reason 
a series of light post has been provid
ed. Thus the steps and walk will be 
Illuminated as tho walks about tho 
campus are.
The steps may also serve as an ap
proach to tho athlotic field this side 
| of the Margaret Morrison school. At 
present this field is only used for 
football practice.

of their line plunges. Yale outweigh
ing Tech naturally resorted to 
straight football, which with a few 
breakB in luck netted the twenty-five 
points.
7000 Witness Game.
About seven thouaand admirera of 
the greatest college port witnessed 
the opening contest In the Yale bowl 
at New Haven, The day was ideal for 
football with the exception that a 
rather strong wind was blowing down 
the field. Although temporarily im
pairing the punting, the advantage in 
the end was about the same for both 
sides. The Yale rooters, perhaps it 
would be more fitting to say attend
ance, although in most football games 
these terms are synonymous, such 
was not the case last Saturday. 
Their cheer leaders, in pretty white 
sweaters, went through various gym
nastics in an endeavor to raise a 
sound, but most of the noise was pro
duced by Captain Black of the Yale 
eleven. His repeated words of en
couragement to his followers would 
have been an eye-opener to the fam
ous Billy Sunday. In fact, the game 
would have lost much of it4 interest 
without Black. He repeatedly drew 
laughs from both sides of the bowl 
during dull moments in the game.
First Quarter.
At five minutes after three the Tech 
team, after having received the last 
words of! advice from Coach Steffen, 
ran upon the field and after a few 
minutes of practice lined up to re
ceive the kickoff. LeGore, with the 
wind at his back, sent a long high 
kick over the Tech goal line. The 
ball was then put into play on the 
Tech twenty yard line. Both Kesner 
and Finley were stopped for no gains. 
Wright punted to Smith, who was 
nailed in his tracks by I-Iellstrom. 
During other parts of the game Hellstrom, although playing center and 
with such men as Black in his way, 
repeatedly beat the ends down on 
punts. Yales first play was a pretty 
one, there was no doubt about that, 
and by the time the play was over 
LeGore had run through the whole 
Tech team for a touchdown.
At this stage of the game the Tech 
outfit, players, coach, rooters and all 
began to feel pretty downhearted, for 
the prospects looked bad. Yale, after 
failing to place the ball between the 
bars on the goal kick, again kicked 
off to Tech. Finlay caught the ball 
and returned it thirty-five yards to
ward the enemys territory. On the 
first play Rupp hit the heavy line for 
one yard, "Sunny Kesner advanced 
the pigskin another eight yards, giving 
the Yalo eleven the first sample of 
Tool) brand football. Rupp gained 
two through the lino, giving the plaid 
first down. Incidentally this two yards 
was gained In spite of the efforts of 
Black and his 2fi0 pounds of avordupois.
To make up 'for this Kesner was 
thrown for a throe yard loss, Rupp 
fumbled and Bingham of Yale ad
vanced ilvo yards. However, Yalo, 
noli being satisfied with her other, ton 
moil, called upon LoGore, who nobly 
answered with a. twenty-five yard 
gain by passing all of the gray 
sweaters with the exception of Kes
ner. Bingham then gained another 
five, and the Yale quarterback regis
tered a first down. Here Yale fum
bled and the Tech eleven again had 
a chance to play with the pigskin, 
Gibson having recovered the ball on 
the Tech ten yard line. Wright punt
ed to Smith who returned ten yards. 
LeGore again was given the ball and 
within a few plays placed the ball 
near enough the line for Smith to 
push it over for the second score of 
the game. Yale failed to kick the 
goal. On the next kickoff Finlay re
turned thirty yards, and in the first 
play made another five yards off the 
Yale left tackle. The game having 
grown a bit tiresome here Kesner 
added zest to tlie quarter with 
thirty yard run. Rupp failed at the 
line and Kesner gained five. Williams 
replaced Gibson. After a few ex
changes of punts and a nine yard run 
by Kesner the quarter closed.
Second Quarter.
Tech punted to Smith who ran the 
ball back twenty yards. Yale after 
being thrown for a two yard loss, 
punts to Kesner who, shaking several 
Yale men, makos a fifteen yard gain. 
Here Tech took a decided brace and 
mado another first; down in two plays, 
after an oight, yard gain by Finlay. 
Tech gained another yard when Yalo 
took possession of the ball after a 
fumble by Rupp. Yalo punted, Tech 
receiving the ball on her forty yard 
lino. Finlay having lost four yards 
Wright punted out on the Yale 
twenty yard lino. Here some more 
punts wore exchanged. Tech tried a 
forward pass Kesner to Wright 
which netted ten yards, and made 
first down for Tech. In' this quarter 
Yale failed to register and was played 
to a standstill by the Plaid eloven. 
Although getting a. bad start, mainly j 
through the briliant runs of LeGore, 
Tech came back strong and fought, 
for every inch of ground.
Between the halves some of the 
Tech rooters, together with a few 
others of. the attendance, gave some 
of the Tech yells.
Third 'Quarter.
Wright kicked off to LeGore who, 
but for Kesner'^s interference in the 
matter, would have registered another 
touchdown. As an open field runner 
LeGore was good; in fact he was bet
ter than any halfback who played 
against the plaid .eleven last year. 
For a few plays the Plaid line proved 
rather a stone wall affair for Yale till 
Bingham finally found a hole and reg
istered the third score. Yale kicked 
goal and the score now stood Yale 
19, Tech 0.
Both sides exchanged punts and 
LeGore tried a drop kick which failed. 
Tech managed to make another first 
down, when Rupp was hurt. Brunwasser was put in Rupp's place at 
fullback and Bolinger put in at half. 
Kesner, after being thrown for a loss, 
signaled for a punt. Yale then 
worked some more straight football. 
Grady featured in breaking up some 
of. the Yale plays. The quarter ended 
with Captain Black still administering 
much enthusiastic advice to the Eli 
team.
Fourth Quarter.
In the fourth quarter. Yale made 
several substitution^ and took out Le 
Gore. The second string men did 
about as well as the first. Tech 
ruined a Yale forward pass to start 
with. The Eli team again threatened 
to score but was stopped, and Wright 
punted out of danger. Yale attempt
ed another forward pass which again 
was spoiled. Van Nostrand then feat
ured with a fifty yard run, somehow 
or other Black was interference for 
him, and had spilled most of the 
Tech team. In fact Kesner was the 
only man between the ball and anoth
er score. It isnt known just how it 
happened but the fact remains that 
Black, the runner and the ball all de
cided they had traveled far enough 
when they came to Kesner. For the 
remainder of the game Yale had the 
ball most of the time, and in the last 
few minutes of play pushed over an
other touchdown, making the score 
25-0. The lineup:

When the' problems set by the En
gineers Society wore formulated last 
fall it was not; thought by either .fac
ulty or students that Tech would 
mako such a clean sweep of the sets 
as she did. It was with a feeling of 
deep satisfaction that Dean Leete read 
the names of the men whose work 
was so honored by the practicing en
gineers.

The George H. Smith Scholarship 
of $100 offered by the Alumni Associa^ 
tion, and so named in honor of a for
mer President of. the Association, who 
died several years ago, has been 
awarded Mr. L. H. Boss, last year a 
junior in the School of Applied De
sign.
Mr. Boss is known to all the older 
men as the editor-in-chief of last,

Sigma Rlio repeated its triumph of 
last year in again winning the interfraternity cup offered by the faculty 
of the School of Applied Science for 
the highest standing maintained by 
fraternities in scholastic require
ments. If Sigma Rho can repeat this 
victory next year it will become the 
permanent holder of the cup.
The winners of the Plebe Scholar
ship offered by the Institute, and the 
Rauh Scholarship offered by Mr. Ed
win S. Rauh in memory of his mother, 
will be announced in next weeks
(Continued From Page One.) 
IstCred in school and eligible to play, 
is busy getting the signals under con
trol, and will perhaps be in the lineup 
against Bethany on Saturday Holz 
worth and Marshall, who were also 
ineligible, are expected to be back in 
the game by Thursday, but it is un
likely that they will appear against 
the West Virginia aggregation. Coach 
Steffan, assisted by Mr. Eyman, is 
busily engaged in hammering the men 
with signals, strengthening the de
fense and increasing the repertoire 
of plays.
Owing to the scarcity of varsity 
material and the danger of injuring 
some of the regulars, Steffan did 
not allow his men to scrimmage be
fore the Yale game. This week, 
with the men who were previously, in
eligible and some new material out, 
the squad will be given several- hard 
workouts. Two of the new arrivals 
are Eeirly and Kindi, the latter a sub 
end of the varsity three years ago, 
while Early is a new man from 
Greensburg, where he played in the 
baclcfield.
If Tech runs up a sood score 
against Bethany in the first half Sat
urday, the Plaid rooters will have a 
fine chance to see some of the second 
string men in action. Even though 
the team put up such a good fight 
against Yale we cannot predict a vic
tory against Bethany, but with all the 
old men in the game it will be a 
struggle worth witnessing.
J. N. NICKLE RESIGNS
FROM HIS POSITION
(Continued From Page One.) 
tions in the citys business life.
Mr. Niclcle is the fifth man in the 
course of four years to step from his 
job at Tech into a larger and more 
lucrative field. R. W. Williams two
years ago resigned the assistant sec
retaryship to become manager of the 
Harvard Club of New York City. 
George I-I, Redding, his successor in 
office, entered into the employ of the 
Lehigh Portland Cement Co. L. L, 
Beelcen, who was assistant secretary 
last year, and one of the best that
Tech ever had, left last spring to rep
resent the Pittsburgh Testing Labora
tory at Dallas. His resignation was 
soon followed by J. J. Murphys, who 
last June sailed for France to join the 
American Sales Company at Bor
deaux.
All of these men were apprised of 
these positions through the applica
tion of these various companies for 
Tech men. In each case the job was 
one which a student could not fill, 
and not to be undone because of this, 
member of the administrative staff 
were grabbed instead. In each case, 
however, these positions were ten
dered without solicitation from those 
to whom they finally fell. As Mr. 
Nickle expressed it to The Tartan 
scribe, It is quite true that we in 
this office have frequent chance to 
learn of good positions that are open 
here and there, but we are not run
ning an employment agency for our
selves. Our chief job is to secure 
work for Tech students, and the rec
ords of the office show that this is 
done to the best of our ability. How
ever, the training and experience 
gained by working in an office like 
this, where we are constantly thrown 
In contact with men, with the prob
lem of employment which is always 
a big one in business and the associ
ation in the management of as busi
ness office which the secretarys is, 
all this equips a man for a pl^ce in 
the business world'.* Naturally, then, 
offers do come, the kind of offers, too, 
that do not generally come to under
graduates.
& The moral of this 'story is that the 
Bureau of Recommendations is a val
uable office for the Tech student to 
tie up with. It is the connecting link 
between the school and business and 
professional life. It is the best adver
tiser Tech has because it is constant
ly placing the Tech man where he 
can be useful and where he can dem
onstrate what Tech does for a fellow.
