PAFENBACH ELECTED TO 
THISTLE EDITORSHIP
Brandin and Blau Will Be 
Representatives From Sci
ence to the Board
At a meeting of the Science Soph
omore Class held last Friday, the 
editor-in-chief and two board mem
bers for next years Thistle were se
lected. The honor of editing next 
years book goes to E. H. Pafenbach, while his assistants from 
Science will be G. R. Brandin and H. 
'H. Blau. The new editor hopes that 
the other schools will elect their 
representatives as soon as possible 
so that he may get the board or
ganized to do such preliminary work 
as is necessaary this spring.
The retiring board desires to con elude its duties as soon as possible. 
All men who have ordered Thistles 
but have not yet called for them
 should do so at once. Also those 
classes .and organizations which are
in debt to the Thistle should clear 
that matter up immediately.
RED CROSS AUXILIARY 
PRESENTED WITH CHECK
A check for $100 was sent to the 
;president of the Tech auxiliary by 
the Allegheny auxiliary of the Red
 Cross. The money came from the 
benefit play A Womans Way, giv
en in Carnegie Music Hall recently. 
The play was produced by Dr. Mal
colm McLeod of the M. M. C. S. 
English department and Mrs. Eliza
beth M. Vermorclcen of the same de
partment took the part of Mrs. Liv
ingstone.
NIOHT STUDENTS H0LD_ 
FIRST ANNUAL DANCE
The night students of the four 
schools gave their first dance last 
^Saturday evening in Carnegie Union. 
Nirellas four-piece orchestra played 
"fourteen numbers, and three extras.
The night students, numbering two 
hundred couples enjoyed the first of 
-what promises to become an annual 
dance. At 8:30 oclock Mr. Ben
nett of Design School, and his bride 
of two days, led off the Grand 
March.
There was no vacant floor space 
when the dances started immediately 
after the March.
During intermission Director Hammerschlag told he dancers the 
event was the most successful night 
student activity of the year, and it 
would be his pleasure to make the 
dance an annual affair. The 'evening 
terminated the night school year, 
i which closes four weeks earlier 
than day school.
STUDENT ACTIVITIES 
TO CONSIDER INSIGNIA
Wednesday, May 9, the student 
activities board held their monthly 
session. Among other matters that 
were taken up for consideration was 
that of insignia for members of the 
different activities. The final de
cision was that the insignia should 
be medal shaped, about the' size of 
a clime with the distinctive emblem 
of the activity encircled by a C.
First year .........................Bronze
Second year .........................Silver
Third year ...........................Gold
Fourth year .........................Jewel
However, before a member can 
receive his succeeding emblem the 
one for the year before must be re
turned. In the case of the Thistle, 
however, the committee was advised 
to consider the Editor and Business 
Manager worthy of a gold medal. 
Others silver and bronze.
It was also voted that next year 
four tickets, each worth 25c, be in
corporated in Student Activities fee. 
They will be good for part payment 
for
Band Concert.
I-Iome Concert.

The object of this is to arouse

TENNIS TEAM WON ALL MATCHES FROM GROVE CITY LAST SATURDAY
Beatty Played Best Game for 
Tech, But All Players 
Are .Steady
SCHEDULE UPSET
Last Saturday, under very unfavor
able weather conditions, Tech opened 
the tennis season by defeating Grove 
City. Neither team was playing at 
its best and on the whole the playing 
was very ragged. Beatty played best 
i for Tech, and appears to be, in both 
singles and doubles a strong, con
sistent player.
The scores were as follows: 
SINGLES:
BeattyBlack, 6-2, 6-1.
KosslerAnderson, 6-1, 6-2.
, SteenBaird, 6-2, 6-0.
DavisBlack, 7-5, 7-5.
DOUBLES:
1 Steen, KosslerBaird, Anderson,
-2, 6-3.
Davis, BeattyBlack, Black, 7-5, 
-2.
Unfortiinately the well arranged 
schedule which Manager Sping had
- planned has been broken up by can
cellation. The next game will be 
Saturday with Grove City on their 
courts. Allegheny College has can
celled its two tennis matches with 
the Plaid, at Meadville next Sat
urday and in Pittsburgh Friday of 
next week, so that only three tennis 
contests remain on the card, with 
Grove City, Pitt and Kenyon. The 
Penn State team has been re-sched
uled for tomorrow afternoon at 2 
o'clock and a return match with 
Pitt also is figured upon. With 
these two possibilities, five matches 
in all may yet be played.
OFFICERS RUSHED AT 
FORT NIAGARA CAMP
According to reports received from 
Professor Stanton, the officers train
ing camp at Fort Niagara is to in
crease its enrollment by over 1,200 
the coming week. Soon after arrival 
Captain Stanton was assigned to the 
Commissary department and now 
has command of a squad. There is 
a great deal of activity in camp, as 
the government is in need of thou
sands of trained officers to command 
the half million conscripts about to 
be called out.
Many Tech Men
Serving Nation
Through the Registrar's Office the Tartan has been able to ob
tain the names oil the men who have already left school to enlist 
or to help the nation industrially. There are however many more 
men who have enlisted but have not yet dropped from school, as 
is particularly the case with those who are entering the Engineerss 
Corps. Also it is quite possible that there are some who have left 
but whose absence has not been reported. In either case their 
names do not appear in the following list, and The Tartan would 
appreciate it greatly if such men would be reported to us as soon 
as possible.
The list is first divided according to the kind of service, and 
subdivided according to schools: The Naval Coast Defense Reserve, 
more often called the Mosquito Fleet, is abbreviated N. C. D. R.;

TECH BREAKS GROUND 
FOR ITS_WAR FARMS
Fraternities Began Work in 
Schenley Park Last Sunday
Due to the fact that time is val
uable just now, the Tech fraternities 
on Squirrel Hill, including the Woodlawn Club, Sigma Nu, Zeta Lambda 
Epsilon and Tau Gamma Phi, and 
other Tech students assembled at 
10:30 a. m. on Sunday and started 
on the garden plots. The site chosen 
is near the oval and will be a tenacre truck garden. The work will 
be in charge of Superintendent 
George W. Burke of the park bureau, 
A. C. Shi#k, a State College expert, 
and Mrs. Leonard G. Woods. The 
work was. opened with ceremony 
Sunday morning in which Mrs. W. M. 
I-Ia.ll decorated the volunteers with 
War Farms badges.
GIRLS PUBLISH SPRING 
ISSUEJF^ SHILLING
The spring issue of the Shilling, 
the M. M. C. S. periodical, is the 
best issue yet produced. The vari
ous departments of the school are 
on the whole, well represented, 
though more might be said of House
hold Economics and General Science.
It is a larger number and com
prises a. wider circle of contributors 
than ever before. The introduction 
of some new colored cuts adds great
ly to the magazine.
SOCIAL FUNCTIONS FOR 
COMMENCEMENT WEEK
The general unrest which at pres
ent prevades the entire school seems 
to preclude any elaborate celebra
tion of commencement this year, 
and thus far very little has been 
done in preparation for the event.
Notice was sent to the various 
classes some time ago, requesting 
them to select dates for the various 
functions to be held, but the only 
reply so far received has been from 
the Science Seniors, naming the 
date for their Banquet. When inter
viewed, however, they said that the 
usual events, Senior Swim, etc., 
would be held. No exact dates for 
these have been set.
It is thought that the girls school 
will hold their regular class day 
exercises, and there is also a rumor 
of a competitive military drill by 
companies to be held on class day.
ENGINEERING SOCIETY 
TO HAVE DUTCH LUNCH
There will be an annual meeting 
of the Carnegie Mechanical Engi
neering Society and a Dutch Lunch 
on May 26, at the German club on 
Craft avenue.
Mr. John H. MacAlpine, engineer 
of the Westinghouse Mfg. Co., will 
speak on "The Training of an Engi
neer.
Many of the "Grads will be there 
and all the Mechanicals will be glad 
to hear from them and their experi
ences in the field.
The Engineering concerns of the 
Pittsburgh District are co-operating 
with the society to make the affair 
a rousing success by giving various 
kinds of favors.
All Plebes who have elected me
chanical engineering are invited to 
attend. Tickets may be had from 
J. H. Davis, Fifth year night or from 
any of the section representatives.
FIRST TECH REGIMENT 
REVIEWED DY DIRECTOR
Band Again Proves to be 
Great Attraction
Yesterday morning the two Bat
talions of our regiment went thru 
their first dress parade on the drill 
grounds. The band in uniform, 
played martial airs, to which the 
student troopers kept step while 
executing various drill maneuvers. 
Ca.pt. Meyers, assisted by Plattsburg 
men and student officers, drilled the 
regiment in every movement the men 
had practiced, particular attention 
being directed to square movements, 
the most difficult yet essential part 
of soldiery.
Director Hammerschlag was offi
cial reviewer and appeared highly 
pleased with the performance of 
the boys. Our regiment is there.
RED CROSS MAY BALL 
FINANCIAL SUCCESS
The* Red Cross Dance, given last 
Friday evening in the Carnegie Mu
sic Hall, served its purpose very 
well. About 350 couples attended 
and over $400 was taken in for 
Red Cross activities.
Girls from the Margaret Morrison 
School were stationed at the doors 
to induce others to join the Rod 
Cross and collect money. They also 
furnished the lemonade and cakes. 
Bowens orchestra furnished the 
music.
It was suggested that the crowd 
in the large hall much resembled 
dancing in the Union Station. Still 
in spite of the crowd and the sticky 
floor around the punch, all agreed 
that everyone had a good time.
DR. POLAND ADDRESSES 
INDUSTRIES ASSEMOLY
Wednesday, May 9, Dr. M. E. Po
land ol! the No-Tobacco League of 
America addressed the students of 
the School of Applied Industries. 
Although greatly handicapped for 
time Dr. Poland succeeded in laying 
down a few very poignant facts 
about the use of tobacco and Its ef
fect upon the human system.
No doubt we all know that tobacco 
contained a harmful narcotic in the 
shape of nicotine but practically l'ew 
who use the weed realize that that 
same drug is the most deadly poison 
known to chemical science with the 
possible exception of Prussic acid. 
Though some theories of the league 
are rather far fetched the cause 
boars reason for consideration.
STUDENT REGIMENT 
LEDJYTECH BAND
Thursday morning the Tech brass 
musical organization, the band, cred
ited themselves and the student 
troopers, by their appearance on the, 
drill grounds. Leader Sullivan 
sounded the bugle call and led the 
band musicians as they played to 
perfection our best military songs. 
New pep and interest in the drill 
was very manifect throughout the 
morning, as the students kept step 
with the martial music. Every army 
regiment has its band, and the Tech 
regiment has one of its own. Lets 
have more of this at drill.

introduction written by Theodore 
Roosovelt; "The international Mili
tary Digest, a book of modern war
fare; "The Business Digest, a book 
for the business man who wishes to

The Carnegie library school brings 
many librarians from other cities. 
This Is particularly true of those 
who are especially interested In 
work with children, as tills Is the 
only school In the world specializing 
In this particular training.
At present the course of training 
for childrens librarians is tlio only 
one offered, but the library plans 
to open a course In school library 
work in autumn to provide for the 
growing field In the public schools.
For May, storlos Styyy bo told after 
school hours to the school chlldron 
on the following days: Monday,
Central library and West End 
branch; Tuesday, East Liberty, 
Homewood, Hazelwood, Southsldo, 
ML. Washington and Wylie avenue 
branches, and Saturday In the Lawronceville branch.
The death of Dr. Albert Ellis 
Frost, for 30 years registrar at the 
University of Pittsburgh, Friday 
morning resulted in the postpone
ment of the annual Tech-Pitt dual 
track and field meet, scheduled for 
Schenley oval Saturday afternoon. 
A later date probably will be ar
ranged.
Instead Carnegie Techs track team 
took part in the first big outdoor 
athletic meet of the season, lielcl 
yesterday afternoon at the Schenley 
oval by The Pittsburgh Press and 
had little trouble in scoring the high
est number of points, 25 being 
chalked up to the credit of the Plaid. 
These were rolled up by scoring 
two first places, four second places 
and three thirds, P. A. A. was second 
with 15 points, the Winged Head 
athletes finishing first In two events, 
second in one event and third in two 
others.
in the open events, Tech had lit
tle real opposition outside of P. A. 
A., these teams finishing first and 
second, respectively. The Tioga A. 
C., was third with eight points and 
the Scholastic A. C. fourth with six. 
Unattached athletes tallied five 
points, Peabody H. S. scored three 
and Westinghouse club one point.
There were 14 starters in the 100 
yards dash, open handicap, and one 
of the most strenuous struggles of 
the day was witnessed. Dilllard, the 
colored star, and a member of tlio 
Scholastic A. C. romped home a 
winner in this event with a scanty 
margin over Smith of Tech, the lat
ter, finishing second. Lingonfolser 
of Carnegie Tech was third. Excel
lent time was made, the victor, le2 
received a two yards handicap, was 
clocked In 10 L-5 seconds.
The one mile run, open handicap, 
was another feature event. This 
was won by Grover Caughoy of the 
P. A. A. In 4:84 '1-5. Harry Hepler 
of the Tioga A. C. was second and 
McClure of the P. A. A. third. The 
entrants In this race wore In the 
best of condition and the finish ol! 
this struggle Avas Interesting. At the 
half-mile mark, Bondor of Tech was 
leading, Caughoy being second. The 
time registered at this mark was 
2:14.
The one mile rolay, open handi
cap, was captured .by an unattached 
team consisting of Grumbling, Eclc* 
hardt, Walker and Shay. P. A. A. 
was second and Carnegie Tech third. 
The time was 8:29. The unattached 
team and Winged head runners led 
until a. half-lap before the finish 
when Shay pulled to the front.

Barret of the Collegians Has 
Pitchers Battle With Hird
SZORE 3 TO 2
The spectators of last Fridays 
game at the field witnessed an ex
hibition of ball playing seldom seen 
in college circles. The Pittsburgh 
Collegians, composed of crack ex
coliege players of the vicinity, 
struck an unexpected snag in Tech's 
baseball team. For eight innings the 
Plaid team outplayed the visitors at 
every department of the game but 
the old jinx sat on Tech very 
heavily in the ninth and the game 
was lost.
The contest was a pitcher's battle 
between Hird and Barret until the 
sixth when Kauff of the Collegians 
got the first hit off Hird and knocked 
in Steinbrenner, who scored from 
second base. Tech fully demon
strated that it can hit when it staged 
a batting rally in the last half of the 
sixth. Yeager, the first man up 
knocked a smashing double and he 
scored when Gano duplicated his 
performance by doubling to left 
field.
Tech forged ahead in the eighth, 
when Yeager knocked Ills second 
two-bagger and third hit of the 
game and scored his second run on 
a wild throw to third. In the ninth 
Osborne relieved I-XIrd. Tn this In
ning the Collegians scored two runs 
and when Tech came up for bats 
they were unable to get a man on 
first.
The support accorded Hird by the 
team and the team work shown by
Grove City Goes Without a 
Hit For Nine Innings
SCORE 1 TO 0
The plaid baseball nine had the 
pleasure of losing another of those 
heartbreakers last Saturday, Grove 
City winning by a 1 to 0 score. 
Batchelor, pitching for Grove City 
hit Goth who was first up, thus giv
ing him the first sack. Miller, who 
appeared next on the list' was 
treated similarly only to a more in
tense degree. The first ball pitched 
to him struck him a stinging blow 
on the back of the right hand at the 
base of the fingers almost breaking 
them. 1-Ie was allowed Kesner, who 
has a sore arm, as runner, but fin
ished the game altlio the member 
pained him badly.
Goth was forced to second by Kesner's advance to first sack. With 
Doherty up and no men down the 
old hit and run game was attempted 
but failed to produce, and when the 
clouds rolled away Goth had been 
thrown out at home and Doherty 
had struck out. On a foul tip re
covered by the catcher, Yeager was 
called out and retired! the side.
A similar occurance happened the 
second inning with two men on 
bases, and from then on Tech was 
unable to get more than one man 
on at a time.
To Darlington goos the credit for 
pitching one of the nicest games of 
baseball which could ever bo wit
nessed. Not one hit did he allow 
to the Grove City aggregation until 
the ninth inning when Shafer dropped

On Friday, May 11, 1917, amid 
more cheering than lamenting, the 
coffin which contained the symbols 
of the ignominy heaped upon all 
Plebes was burned on a funeral bier 
on Tech Field.
The day was a. memorable one 
for the Plebes, not only because it 
marked their emancipation from reg
ulations which they considered any
thing but pleasant, but because it 
also marked their entrance into the 
Tech Clan, an honor worth no small 
amount of discomfort to procure.
The coffin, a large affair of black 
and purple, draped with the numerals 
1920, lay in state between tall can
dlesticks in the foyer of the Design 
School all day Friday. At three 
oclock it was solemnly carried to 
the terrace before the school, where 
the Margaret Morrison Plebes were 
assembled.
This is the first year that M. M. 
C. S. has entered into the celebra
tion of Qualification Day, and the 
young women added in no small 
measure to the spirit of the occa
sion. The arrangement of their hair, 
though in most cases not particular
ly becoming, at least gave them the 
much-craved appearance of extreme 
youth.
The Science and Industries Plebes 
were lined up in front of the Cen
tral Building, and the Design Plebes 
before Design. The band, playing 
the solemn funeral march, the six 
wlvite-robed pall-bearers with their 
awful burden, and the mournful (?) 
M. M. C. S. Plebes headed the pro
cession down Woodlawn avenue, the 
men falling in with the old familiar 
left foot high. Once 011 the Held 
the real program of the day began. 
The coffin was placed 011 a platform 
facing the stands, and slowly and 
sadly the Plebes filed past, con
signing to its depths armbands, 
Plebe hats, black ties, and socks,
The program which followed, al
though short, was interesting not 
only to the Plobes, but to the upper 
classmen and visitors as well. J. E. 
Ivosner spoke of the traditions of 
Tech, which have been built up by 
former classes, and reminded the 
class of 1920 of the duties and obli 
gallons which would become theirs 
as part of the work of the clan to 
which they were to be admitted. To 
the next speaker, Miss Florence 
Bethcel, he gave in charge the chain 
which, with its links for each class, 
symbolizes the unity and strength of 
the bonds which unite the Carnegi 
Clan. She spoke of the prospects of 
future classes, and expressed the 
hope that the class of 1918 would 
prove as strong a link in the Tech 
chain as has the present graduating 
class. P. L. A. Kaiser, Industries 
Middle Classman, spoke briefly on 
Qualifications; and Tom Orr read 
the Plebes the pledge of the Car
negie Clan, which was accepted in 
the name of the class by W. Vieliman. His address, accompanied by 
appropriate gestures and illustra
tions, was greatly appreciated by his 
classmates. Finally, the numerals of 
the class of 1917 were stamped 011 
its link, and the link of the 1920 
class was added to the Tech chain 
by Ray Hawke.
The coffin was again taken up by 
the pall-bearers and the solemn pro
cession moved across the field to 
the funeral bier. While the flames 
consumed the last symbols of their 
period of probation, the newly quali
fied clansmen formed a long line and 
marched, cheering, around the coffin, 
which was soon a heap of ashes.
And so the tangible signs of the 
event are gone, but there remains, 
and always will remain in the hearts 
of. the 1920 Tribe the spirit ex
pressed by' the pledge of the Car
negie Clan. Our hearts are in the 
work."

An an assembly of the Science 
school students last Friday, G. W. 
Todd, Junior Mechanical, was elected 
as the Science candidate for the 
presidency of the Carnegie Tech 
Student Council. The final election 
for the presidency of this body will 
be held not later than the third 
week of this month by the mem
bers of the present council.
During the meeting, E. H. Pafenbach, of the Lawtochfrarie, a Soph
omore honorary society, announced 
the names of those plebes who be
cause of their' interest and accom
plishment in school activities had 
been pledged to the society.
An amendment of the clause in 
the Student Council Constitution re
ferring to the Executive Board of 
the Council was advocated by the 
student body. This amendment, 
which provides that the, executive 
board shall consist of the presidents 
of the 'four schools and the presi
dent of the council, was suggested 
by the students of Applied Indus
tries, who refused to accept the con
stitution in its original form.
The meeting was the last to be 
presided over by T. E. Orr, president 
of the Science school senate who 
left Friday night for the Officers 
Training Camp at Fort Niagara,

NEW YORK STATE 
CLUB HOUSE ASSURED
Last Meeting of the Year to 
Discuss Plans
Every Tech. man from New York 
State who has the spirit of the 
Empire State in him is wanted at 
the meeting to be held in Room 135 
A. I. after the Flag Raising pic
tures have been shown next Friday 
evening/' May 18th.
Smokes, eats, and a good time 
are on the program, and there will 
also be election of officers for next 
year. The club house is to be dis
cussed and the details settled. The 
arrangements which have been made 
for the club are first-class and the 
men who wish to be in on the propo
sition had better be present to make 
sure of the offer.
If possible, a plan of the club 
house will be there and suggestions 
may be made. The complete idea 
will be discussed Friday evening 
and definite action taken.
CHORAL CLUB ABANDONS 
PLANS FOR ROBIN HOOD
Owing to the fact that President 
A. H. Schultz of the Choral Club, has 
left for active service on a farm and 
also that many other members of the 
club have been lost similarly, it was 
decided at a recent meeting that all 
preparations for the rendition of that, 
well-known opera Robin Hood, be 
dropped for the present year.
The Choral Club, however, may or
ganize again next year and render 
this or something similar.
GIRLS TO BE EXAMINED 
IN FIRST AIR WOBK
First aid examinations will be 
given on Saturday, May 19 and 26 
by Dr. Decker in the M. M. C. S. 
Recreation Hall. A misunerstanding 
as to the obligations incurred by 
taking the examination has arisen. 
Taking the course, passing the ex
amination and getting a certificate 
does not means a girl will be forced 
to go to the front but simply means 
that she is prepared if she wishes 
to offer her services to her country. 
Probably 3 of every 1,000 offers will 
be accepted.
COSTUME SENIORS GET 
PRACTICE IN TEACHING
On account of a run-down condi
tion, Miss Ingersoll, teacher of Dress
making and Special Methods in the 
Costume Economics Department, lias 
been compelled to give up her work 
for the rest of the year.
Miss Hinman, head of the depart
ment, will fill Miss Ingersolls place. 
This giv;es the Seniors in this 
Course a chance to display their 
pedagogical knowledge before Miss 
Hinmans Sophomore Classes. All 
the work, however, will be super
vised and graded by Miss Hinman.

Tartan is endeavoring to supply in
formation about several branches of 
service. The following article on the 
Marine Corps is particularly appro
priate in view of the fact that June 
10 to 16 is to be Marine Corps week. 
The accompanying letter is from 
the recruiting officer of the Pitts
burgh district:
Editor The Tartan,
Carnegie Institute,
Pittsburgh, Pa.
Dear Sir:
The week of June 10th to 16th 
has been designated as Marine Corps 
Week throughout the country. The 
Marines will endeavor to enlist 4,000 
men during that week. Pittsburghs 
quota is to be 100.
I request that you give this 
publicity in your paper. It will be a 
splendid opportunity for young men 
of the University who contemplate 
enlisting to join the Marines for 
the war and stay together during 
their service. The idea will be to 
get as many of the 100 together 
so they will form a company and 
remain intact as far as the service 
will permit.
As the date is about the time the 
University will close and undoubted
ly many of the students will be look
ing for service, the Marine Corps 
offers excellent opportunity for pro
motion and action.
Yours truly,
W. GARLAND FAY.
The United States Marine Corps 
was first called into existence by an 
Act of the Continental Congress of 
November 10, 1775, and gallantly 
served throughout the Revolutionary 
war. It was disbanded at the close 
of the war, April 11, 1782, but was 
reorganized and permanently estab
lished July 11, 1798. From that day 
to this its officers, and men have 
been zealous participants in every 
expedition and action in which the 
Navy has engaged, and in many try
ing campaigns they have won distinc
tion with-their brethren of the Army. 
It is the gallant little corps that lias" 
so ably assisted in fighting Americas 
hattles in every corner of the globe 
for more than a century; and the 
Marine Corps has ever been tme to 
its motto, Semper Fidelia (always 
faithful.)
The Marines serve both at sea and 
on land. They are trained, clothed 
and equipped very much as are 
soldiers of the land forces. In 
their preliminary instruction on 
shore at navy yards and naval sta
tions, they are instructed and drilled 
in the. duties of infantry soldiers, 
field artillerymen and machine gun 
companies. In preparation for their 
duties as landing parties from ships 
of the Navy, for expeditionary duty 
and as defenders of naval advance 
bases, they are further trained in 
aviation, in the use of portable 
searchlights, the . wireless telegraph, 
the heliograph, and the various other 
methods of signaling; range finding, 
the erection, operation and mantenance of telegraph and telephone 
lines, the planting of land and sub
marine mines, the handling of tor
pedoes, the erection and demolition 
of bridges, the building of roads, 
knotting and splicing of ropes, hand
ling boats under oars and sails, the 
handling of heavy -weights, the fit
ting of gun gear, and the various 
methods of slinging and transporting 
ordnance, and the mounting in suit
able shore positions of guns of 
three, five and six-inch calibre.
In their service on battleships and 
cruisers, the Marines form a part of 
the ships compliment for battle, 
manning the six-inch, five-inch, threeinch, and six-pounder guns of the 
intermediate and secondary batter
ies, and anti-aircraft guns. They 
are trained and fully equipped for 
instant service as landing parties for 
duty on shore.
Great mobility and facilities for 
quick action are required of the Ma
rines. They must be kept in readi
ness to move at a moments notiee, 
and be prepared for service in any 
climate. - They have seen service in 
Egypt, Algiers, Tripoli, Mexico, 
China, Japan, Korea, Cuba, Porto 
Rico, Panama, Nicaragua, Santo Do
mingo, Formosa, Sumatra, Hawaii, 
Samoa, Guam, Alaska, the Philippine 
Islands and Haiti.
On shore Marines live in large 
commodious barracks, in which every 
necessity^ is provided. Each man is 
furnished a comfortable bed, mat
tress, sheets, pillow and blankets, 
which he is required to keep in 
order. The beds are arranged in 
large, properly heated, well venti
lated dormitories, known as Squad 
Rooms. Ample provision is made 
for the health and comfort of the 
men.
Vacancies'are constantly occuring 
in the non-commissioned grades, and 
men are selected to fill them in ac
cordance with their records, indi
vidual merits, and ability to perform 
the duties -of the higher positions. 
Encouragement and opportunity are 
given to young men of good charac
ter and ability to remain in the ser
vice and climb to the higher posi
tions of. trust and honor.
By the time a Marine has served 
his enlistment, of four years and rein our constantly increasing Marine 
Corps, promotion is corresponding
ly rapid, and a young man possess
ing the necessary qualifications may 
climb to the top of the ladder. The 
law provides for the promotion of 
worthy non-commissioned officers to 
commissioned rank.
Since the Spanish-American War 
4S young men have been commis
sioned from the ranks of the Marine 
Corps as Second Lieutenants, receiv
ing further promotion in their turn. 
One has already attained the rank 
of Lieutenant-Colonel. It is not 
desired, however to create the im
pression that promotion from the 
ranks to commissioned grade is easi
ly attained for only men possessing 
exceptional qualifications are so pro
moted.
One hundred enlisted men are 
picked from the Marine Corps and 
Navy each year, by competitive ex
amination, to be sent to the Naval 
Academy at Annapolis, Md., there to 
be educated and trained as officers, 
and, upon graduation, they will be 
commissioned in the Marine Corps 
or Navy.
The law also provides for the pro
motion of non-commissioned officers 
to the warrant rank in the grades of 
marine gunner and quartermaster 
clerk. Such officers receive from 
approximately $1125.00 to $2500.00 
a year and are entitled to the same 
privileges of retirement as warrant 
officers of the Na.vy. The number 
of warrant officers of the Marine 
Corps is limited to twenty in each 
grade and appointment to warrant 
rank is restricted to competent and 
worthy non-commissioned officers.
With these advantages for the phy
sical training and development, and 
the advantages of a library and read
ing room containing good books, and 
current periodicals, and. ample time 
for reading and study, no hesitancy 
is felt in recommending the Marine 
Corps to any young man of good 
character and regular habits who is 
desirous of improving himself men
tally, morally and physically. The 
healthful and regular life, filled with 
varied and interesting experiences, 
the training that he receives and 
the discipline that is instilled into 
him, tend to make him a better and 
more useful citizen.
Well equipped gymnasiums, libra
ries, reading rooms, amusement 
rooms, billiard and pool tables, bowl
ing alleys, baseball and football out
fits, are provided at all of the larger 
barracks for the amusement and en
tertainment of the men.
The Marine Corps baseball and 
football teams of the various bar
racks often participate in competi
tions with other military teams as 
well as wit.li civilian teams of their 
own and neighboring cities. In some 
cases they play in the semi-professional baseball leagues. Dances, 
carnivals, amateur theatricals, mov
ing picture and minstrel shows are 
frequently arranged for the enjoy
ment of the men.
While in time of peace the regular 
routine of duties in the Marine 
Corps, in comparison with the vari
ous civil life employments, is light 
and the hours of actual occupation 
are short, men should not enlist 
with the expectation of finding it. a 
life of perpetual ease and comfort. 
On the contrary, they should enter 
with the intention of doing tlujir 
share of frequent guard duty, regular 
police duty about the barracks or 
ship, attend the daily drills and in
spections, and whenever necessary 
help in the loading and unloading of 
stores, coaling ship, and any other 
kind of work needed to be done.
In time of war the hardships are 
many. Forced marches, exposure to 
all kinds of weather, uncomfortable 
sleeping accommodations, loss ,ol! 
sleep, and insufficient food and wat
er. But the hardships of war are 
unavoidable and must be expected.
To enlist in the Marine Corps an 
applicant must be not less than 5 
feet, 4 inches, nor more than 6 feet 
1 inch in height; weigh not less 
than 128 lbs. nor more than 233 lbs; 
not less than 18 nor more than 35 
years of age for enlistment as pri
vate; able to speak, read and write 
the English language with ease; na
tive born or naturalized citizen of 
the United States; steady and regu
lar habits; unmarried, with no one 
wholly dependent upon him for sup
port; of good health, strong constitu
tion, well formed, sound as to senses 
and limbs, and not addicted to the 
use of intoxicants or drugs.
The prospective recruit must first 
pass a physical examination by a 
naval surgeon and then undergo a 
critical examination by the recruit
ing officer, who inquires into his 
moral fitness and general desirabil
ity.
By these exacting examinations the 
undesirable men are as far as pos
sible eliminated, and only the best 
are finally accepted and enlisted. All 
applicants at the recruiting station 
are treated with uniform courtesy 
and consideration, and all who con
form to the requirements of the ser
vice in the Marine Corps will bo 
given a fair and impartial examina
tion, the expense of such examination
Minors of not less than eighteen (IS) 
and not more than nineteen (19) 
years of age who may be accepted 
for enlistment as privates to learn 
the drum and trumpet will, if, subse
quently found unsuitable for such 
duty, be retained for regular duty. 
All enlistments shall be made for 
four years.
It sometimes happens that young 
men not yet eighteen years old suc
ceed in passing the examination by 
the enlisting officers by claiming to 
have reached that age. If such a 
case is brought to the attention of 
Headquarters, the boy becomes amen
able to trial and . punishment for 
fraudulent enlistment.
Apprentices to learn music, be
tween the ages of 16 and 17, will be 
accepted for enlistment during min
ority.
The examination of applicants for 
enlistment in the Marine Corps, 
while being thorough, is simple, and 
is merely intended to prove the can
didate intelligent, of moderate edu
cation, physically sound and free 
from disease and bodily ailments or 
deformity.
When a candidate applies at the 
recruiting station he is turned over 
to a member of the recruiting party, 
who gives him whatever information 
regarding the service lie may desire. 
He is then questioned as to his age, 
place of birth, family ties and rela
tions, whether or not lie' lias had 
any previous military experience, 
and what his reasons are for wanting 
to join the Marines. He is then 
given the preliminary examination, 
which inquires into his ability to 
read and write.
Following this the candidate is 
turned over to the surgeon for the
ever the opportunity offers itself.
Especially is this true with rela
tion to foreign travel. In order to 
see foreign lands and strange peoples 
one must needs cross the great 
oceans. Ever has the sea possessed 
an enchanting aiuf enduring fascina
tion for the landsman accustomed 
to the quiet and prosaic life of the 
office, factory or farm. To travel 
by sea. amid evorehanging scenery 
and climatc conditions, to see and 
study the habits and customs of the 
strange races of mankind are, and 
always will be, among the highest 
ambitions of the average man.
If a man bo possessed of great, 
wealth he may travel as his caprice 
may dictate, but bo he not wealthy 
he must necessarily remain around 
the fireside and patiently await such 
opportunities as good fortune may 
bring to him.
The life of the Marine offers op
portunities that appeal to the man 
who desires to see foreign countries 
and satisfy his spirit of adventure. 
Our foreign possessions, and national 
interests have so greatly expanded 
during the last few years that our 
cruising ships and naval stations 
are now scattered over the seven 
seas.
To be turned over for duty means 
much to the recruit, as this is the 
first point in his military career 
that he strives to reach. It means 
that he is now a full-lledged regu
lar that he is to be assigned to a 
regular company and associated with 
men who have grown gray in the 
service, to take part in all the 
drills and parades of liis company; 
that he is now available for guard 
duty, and that he will soon be placed 
on guard, and that he is to experiphysical examination. The surgeon  enee that peculiar pride that is felt
first examines the teeth and satisfies 
himself that the candidate^ molars 
are sound and capable of properly 
masticating food, for men suffering 
from indigestion brought on by bad 
teeth make poor soldiers. The ton
sils and throat are carefully exam
ined, the nasal organs and sense of 
smell, and a careful test made of 
the hearing. The vision test comes 
next, especial care being taken to 
prove the candidate free from weak 
or impaired vision, near or far sight
edness, color blindness or marked 
astigmatism; each eye being tested 
separately. The heart and lungs are 
now examined; any defect, abnormal 
or unnautural condition of these or
gans being cause for rejection. The 
candidates feet are carefully in
spected, and then he is required to 
go through certain prescribed move
ments of the body and limbs to satis
fy the surgeon that he has normal 
use of all members and that each 
joint is naturally supple.
Having successfully passed to this 
stage, all scars and personal char
acteristics available for the purpose 
of identification are carefully noted 
on a chart prepared for that purpose. 
The candidate next goes before the
by the soldier as he walks back and 
forth along his post with a full 
realization of the responsibility that 
rests upon him as the guardian of 
the peace and property of the Gov
ernment of his country. It also 
means that he is to have less drill 
than he had at the Recruit Depot, 
and that he is to have more privil
eges. Taken altogether, he looks for
ward to the day that he will go to 
duty with no small degree of in
terest and anticipation.

Advertising Talk
A student with college spirit wants to see his 
College paper the equal or superior of other college 
papers. For him to merely sit by and let the other 
fellow work will not accomplish this.
The success of a college daily depends as much 
upon the ability of the management to get in 
money as it does upon the editorial staff to fill 
up the news columns.
Only so long as the students read the advertise
ments and do their buying from the firms that ad
vertise, only so long as they do this, can The Tartan 
hope to be a financial success.

IS NEXT OFFERING
Stephen Phillips Paola and Fran
cesca, a thirteenth century Italian 
play, will be produced under the 
direction of Mr. Stevens on May 
22 to 25. The production is of 
interest because it is the first on the 
American stage, the acting rights 
having been held by the English 
actor, George Alexander, for whom 
the play was written. Mr. Stevens 
was given permission to produce it 
here in our Design School theater 
by Mr. Alexander.
This story of these two famous 
lovers was first told by Dante in his 
Divine Comedy, and has been used 
by countless story-tellers since that

Monday afternoon the Tech sec

1.1 to 3. Things looked bad in the 
first when Haber for E. L. A. fanned 
the first three up and then the rest 
of the team made a whirlwind cam

through errors. The Tech men how

STUDENTS AT ARSENAL RELATE EXPERIENCES
Some time ago a body of 12 stu
dents left their Alma Mater for ser
vice in the government arsenal at 
Watertown, Mass. That they seem 
to be in the best of spirits is only 
too eviderft to judge from the way 
they write. Following is a letter 
from them to Prof. Leeds:
Dear Prof: Leeds:
Today we had our first experi
ence at working in the Arsenal. I 
am working in the Foundry, at pres
ent, making rear gun sights. I 
made 84 of them, but believe me, I 
certainly was tired when the day 
was over.
Six of the crowd are in the Ma
chine Shop and the rest in the 
Foundry. Miller, Stevens, Bosler, 
Kirkman, Siard, and myself are in 
the foundry.
My but this foundry certainly is 
busy making gun carriages, shells, 
sights, rings for cannon, etc.
Taking it all for all our Foundry 
at school is certainly a miniature 
foundry. All tho ideas they develop 
there are used here.
Well we had some time landing a
boarding house. For a time it was
rather discouraging. The rain and
snow made it miserable and we had 
to tramp through that, looking for 
a bln mo room or boarding house.
The talk of the to'wn and the
arsenal is about these Carnegie Tech 
hoys from Pittsburgh. Geo Whiz!
I came in the Foundry with a white 
Jacket; and overalls. Tho men 
thought that I was a painter or wall 
paporhangor.
When wo arrived on Friday after
noon, the 12 of us were escorted 
through the grounds to Col. Dick
sons office. We created quite a 
sensation, so much that the guard 
| kept his whistle constantly near his 
mouth. Especially the girls working 
in the arsenal, bookkeepers and the 
like, welcomed us.
So far I have been treated O. K. 
by the people around here. Mr. 
Sampson certainly is a gentleman in 
every respect.
There is one thing surely well 
done, that is, . the place is well 
guarded. Wherever you look you 
see a. soldier.
The soldiers did not expect us 
on Friday and they certainly were 
suspicious of us when they saw us 
make a bee line for the gate.
Well, Prof. Leeds, give my best 
to the fellows, and the Dean, so Ill 
remain and be
Yours,
N. P. VITTE.
The following is an abstract of a 
speech of Andrew Carnegies which 
is of more than passing interest in 
view of the national situation:
Some men think that poverty is 
a dreadful burden and that wealth 
leads to happiness. What do they 
know about it? They only know one 
side, they imagine the other. I 
have lived both, and I know there 
is very little in wealth that can add 
to human happiness beyond the 
small comforts of life. Millionaires 
who laugh are rare. My experience 
is that wealth is apt to take the 
smiles away.
If happiness has not its seat and 
center in the breast.
We may be rich or wise or great, 
but never can be blest.
Mr. Carnegie then told of his 
experience as Assistant General 
Manager of the United States Mili
tary Telegraphs from April to Sep
tember, 1861, as follows:
I went to Washington immediately 
after Sumter was fired on and be
cause the Southern sympathizers 
under Gilmor from Baltimore had 
cut the railroad between Baltimore 
and Philadelphia, my party of rail
road engineers, construction m'en 
and bridge builders, traveled with 
me on- the way to the Capital by 
boat from Perryville to Annapolis. 
We found the railroad track and 
telegraph line broken on the wa.y to 
Washington and I undertook to make 
repairs. In doing the work I grasped 
the broken wire as it hung loose 
from the pole and it flew back and 
struck me in the face, cutting the 
skin and causing blood to flow. This 
was on April 20tli, 1861, the day. 
after the riots in Baltimore in which 
two soldiers were killed by the moll 
I have always claimed that I was 
the third man to shed his blood for 
the Republic in the Civil War.
I once told Secretary Long about 
it and informed him that I thought 
it made me eligible for a pension. 
Long said it was a clear case, as it 
was evident I wasnt able to make 
a living. So now, remember that 
providentially I really did shed my 
blood for the Republic of my love 
and admiration.

ment to restore our flag to the seven 
seas.
College men, because they are pre
paring themselves to take active part 
in the industrial, commercial and in
tellectual life of the nation, ought to 
participate in the movement to bring 
about the re-establisliment of our 
merchant marine, upon which our 
navy depends for auxiliaries and our 
foreign trade for transportation.
There never was a time when the 
merchant marine problem more in
sistently called for solution. To 
take the place of the tonnage de
stroyed in the war our government 
is seeking to build wooden ships by 
the thousand. But an even greater 
question is involved; for the sta
bility of our industries, the very 
prosperity of the country, depends 
in large part on our*- overseas ship
ping facilities. On account of the 
lack of ships our exporters have 
suffered severely from excessive 
freight rates, unfair discrimination 
in favor of foreign competitors and, 
in many cases, actual loss of busi
ness. The greatest factor in cor
recting thse conditions and stabil
izing our home industries will be 
the re-establishment of the merchant 
marine which will restore to Amer
ican industry the control of the dis
tribution and sale of its products. 
This can never be done, however, 
so long as the American public re
mains apathetic to the shipping 
problem. Obsolete restrictive legis
lation must be repealed and friendly 
laws substituted; the accomplish
ment of this will come onlyfrom an 
enlightened public opinion. It is in 
the formation of _ this opinion that 
college men can perform a valuable 
and truly patriotic service because 
our centers of learning must be 
well-springs of correct public opinion.
This body has passed a. resolution 
endorsing the public educational 
campaign being conducted by the 
National Marine League and urging 
all students to co-operate in the 
movement to enlist the active assis
tance of college men by organizing 
an Intercollegiate Marine League.
The council of the student body of 
New York University therefore urges 
every student to participate in this 
movement by informing himself as 
to the merchant marine situation 
and by joining the Intercollegiate Ma
rine League, for the establishment of 
which the National Marine League 
has alreadv taken the first steps.

HONOR SYSTEM PROVES 
SUCCESS WITH PLEBES
The Design School has tried a new 
scheme which has met with great 
success. On April 15, the Plebes 
were given the power to govern 
themselves according to the tradi
tions of the school. They were put 
on their honor to keep those tradi
tions and to punish their violators. 
This power, was vested in the Plebe 
class by the student body, and it is 
now a permanent part of Design 
government.
It has been proven, during the past 
two months that the Plebes are more 
capable of governing themselves and 
supporting the traditions than were 
the upper classmen. They adminis
ter severe and capable punishments 
upon their transgressors. There are 
baptismal ceremonies for sinners.
This form of. self-government will 
be handed down to the Plebe class 
of next year. The Design School is 
proud of its recently graduated Ple
be class for the manner in which it 
has made' itself worthy of the honor 
system, and the upperclassmen wel
come these noble youths to their 
newly attained rank.
