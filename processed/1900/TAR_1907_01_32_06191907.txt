TERRIBLE OUTRAGE!
STARTLING DISCLOSURES MADE 
PUBLIC FR THE FIRST TIME 
REGARDING THE FACULTY 
BASE BALL TEAM
[Special to The Tartan]
Pittsburg, Pa., June 18On the eve of the greatest athletic contest ever held by 
the Carnegie Technical Schools comes the announcement that the Faculty is confident of 
winning the championship over the Junior class. This rumor seems to be well founded for 
it has been discovered that the man who is to hold down the slab was once a premier artist 
in this line somewhere up the state; the left fielder has been known to knock the ball over 
Flagstaff hill during a practice game and first baseman Dosey can step to the pitchers box 
in three steps. Dr. Sill, having lost his beard since the last game, has no difficulty in fol
lowing the progress of the speediest ball. Prof. Keller has spent many sleepless nights 
figuring out the exact angle necessary for a safe hit. Mr. Reed is going to give the fellows 
one more chance. Mr. Lightcap is a new player but it is rumored that State College made 
a great effort to retain him. Every one ought to attend and observe for himself these won
derful doings.
To go into details would be wasting space. Suffice it to say that the Juniors 
are about as blue as the proverbial indigo over their impending defeat. The result of the 
last Faculty game does not seem to have any brightening effect.
June Pi tsbur g, a.JnThe result of the findings of the board of advisors has been 
given out. The line up is as follows :

While ordinary annealing fur
naces, designed for heating by gas 
or coal, do not permit of an ac
curate adjustment or maintenance 
of the temperature appropriate to 
each riven case, electricity has 
recentlv been found a most suit
able means of operating such fur
naces. A special advantage secur
ed by inward heating is the uni
formity of temperature, avoiding 
any deformation, internal strain, 
etc., in the samples treated. The 
type of furnace represented here
with has recently been construct
ed in Berlin, Germany, and con
tains a bath of metal salts or mix
tures of such,, which are raised by 
the electric current to a liquid, in
candescent condition. The fur
nace may be adjusted at will for 
any temperature intermediary be
tween 750 and 1,325 C.
The furnace comprises a rec
tangular tank of fireproof ma
terial, for receiving the salt baths, 
which is fitted into an iron casing 
lined with fire-resisting mortar. 
Single-phase current is supplied 
through wrought-iron electrodes 
fitted opposite one another. The 
electrical energy is converted to 
the low tension at which it is to 
be used, by a transformer con
nected to two iron rails communi
cating with the electrodes. The 
temperature is regulated by con
trolling the number of windings 
in the transformer.
As the metal salt is non-conductive when cold, the process is 
started by*heating with the aid of 
a removable auxiliary electrode.
Where as in ordinary harden
ing furnaces the rapid destruction 
of the crucibles involves a rather 
high expense, the consumption of 
wrought-iron electrodes, as oc
curring in the present furnace, is 
far less expensive. The samples 
are raised to the proper tempera
ture in about one-fifth the time re
quired in the case of the gas furD ZTTST CO.

The temperature required for

while figures intermediary be

certain cases even 1,300 C., will 
prove necessary for the annealing 
of rapid-tool steel. Three stan

for maximum temperatures of 
850, 1,150, and 1,300 C, respec

TrSep of ]lSctric Trictioe.
Ever since the early days of 
electric railways, there has been a 
favorite, popular notion that elec
tricity would shortly supplant 
steam in the operation of long
distance railroads in general; but 
as long as it was necessary to 
build rotary-converter sub-sta
tions along the line about fifteen 
miles apart, very little thought 
was given to electrical operation 
by the managers of steam rail
roads. Within the last two years, 
however, the successful practical 
introduction of the single-phase 
alternating-current series motor 
has put a new aspect upon this 
question; and we find some of the 
foremost electrical engineers seri
ously studying the question of 
operating heavy trunk line service 
electrically, so that what a short 
time ago was merely a dream of 
the enthusiast has now become a 
legitimate engineering problem.
One of the facts which lends to 
belief in the ultimate solution of 
this question, is the steady ad
vance that has been made year by 
year in the application of elec
tricity to the traction. Beginning 
about twentv years ago on short 
experimental lines, the trolley has 
grown to embrace practically 
every city street-railway system 
in the United States, and has 
created a new class of roads 
hitherto unknownnamely, the 
interurban lines, which are num
bered by the hundreds, and which, 
in length, are beginning to com
pare very favorably with many 
steam roads.
The next stage of development 
has been the introduction of elec
tric locomotives for the suburban 
and interurban services of steam 
lines; and this development is 
now taking place on a number of 
the most prominent steam roads, 
both in this country and abroad. 
In the majority of cases where 
electric and steam railway ser
vices have come into competition, 
the electric service has generally 
soon acquired a monopoly of the 
local traffic, on account of the 
cheaper fares, more frequent ser
vice, possibility of boarding the 
cars at any convenient point, etc. 
Hitherto this competition has not 
been regarded as serious by most 
of the steam road managements; 
but today we find the latter in dif
ferent localities awaking to the 
fact that this competition is con
stantly growing more serious; 
and recently a number of cases 
have been reported where steam 
roads are putting forth special ef
forts to regain this loss of local 
traffic, in some cases even going 
to the length of adopting the 
trolley system . for local service 
upon their own lines.
It is not improbable that in this 
way electricity will gradually 
make considerable headwav in its 
application to steam railways; 
and, as steam railroad managers 
become more accustomed to its 
use and more acquainted with its 
advantages, its use will gradually 
spread. While there is little doubt 
in the minds of electrical en
gineers that an electrical system 
could be devised which would be 
perfectly adapted to the use of 
present steam roads, the perform
ance of such a system under all 
conditions of passenger and 
freight service would involve a 
very costly experiment, which 
would- hardly be undertaken by 
any existing railroad.
It is far more probable that the 
application of electricity to steam 
roads will be a matter of gradual 
evolution, at least until there is 
operated a sufficient length of 
railway to furnish reliable data as 
to its practicability and operating 
cost. There is no doubt that the 
steam locomotive will continue to
hold its present prominent posi
tion for many years to come; but 
that it will be eventually super
seded by electricity is predicted 
from the fact, that, while the elec
trical system is nowhere near the 
limits of its possibilities, the 
steam locomotive offers but little 
opportunity for further develop
ment.

You never make a call like Weick

We know the ladies would be won

So its now high time that youd

Forget a while your plugging, nor

Do you not know that much is

ception and smoker to their neigh
bors from the Pioneer Tech. Club. 
The rooms of the cottage were 
tastily decorated in the colors of 
the Cottage and presented a very 
handsome effect. Hwangte 
Knight had prepared an excellent 
musical program which was well 
rendered and enthusiastically re
ceived. Deutche pipes and 
souvenir tobacco pouches were 
presented to the visitors. Ice 
cream and cake was served at ten 
thirty, and at 1 oclock the Pio
neer men left for home, loud in 
their praise for the Woodlawners.

On Friday the picked nines of 
the two dormitories crossed bats 
on the athletic grounds. The game 
was called on account of dark
ness after the fifth inning, with 
the score 12 to 7 favor Woodlawn 
Cottage.
Right here is a good place to 
say that both the non-partisan 
spectators rooted for Woodlawn 
Cottage.
The game was a good one, and 
as interesting on account of the 
sensational work of the Woodlown Cottage stars as it was 
amusing owing to the eccentric 
ideas of some of the Pioneer Tech 
crowd.
Kohler had never heard of a 
rule forbidding the runner to go 
out of line. Tingley thought it 
was fair to step in front of the ball 
to stop a strike and Walton was 
an easy out as he refused to run 
on hitting the ball.
In general, the Pioneer people 
ran the bases like ice wagons, and 
hugged them as if they were M. 
M. C. S. girls.
For Pioneer Tech. Watrous did 
?ood work, while the catching of 
Chancellor was a feature. Bar
ring a little wildness and an 
ascension in the third inning that 
would make Santos Dumont look
green, Sampson pitched a good 
game.
For Woodlawn Cottage, the 
work done by the battery, Thomp
son and Beeken, was excellent 
and at short, Barnes put up a 
game that could scarcely be im
proved. (Foster, I hate to say that 
last, but flag station says he will 
beat time out of me if I dont.)
The work of the umpire was re
markable. No one but Patsy McGraw Watrous questioned a 
single decision, and he kicked 
from principle rather than any be
lief that he was being robbed.

The first of the athletic contests 
celebrating the close of school 
took place on Monday afternoon 
when the Tuniors and Plebes 
came together to decide the 
school baseball championship. 
Luck was with us this time and 
we were favored with a fair day, 
though it was none too bright.
The Plebes started the scoring 
by securing three runs in the first 
of the game The Juniors then 
overtook this lead, but were again 
distanced near the end of the 
game and the game ended with 
the remarkably close score of 10- 
9, in favor of the Juniors.
There was plenty of excitement 
and the errors were fairly well 
sprinkled on the work of both 
teams but more noticeably the 
Juniors. Burnside pitched a bet
ter game than Patch, but wras not 
given as good support. Olnhausen, who caught for the Juniors, 
was badly handicapped by a split 
finger, but it was hardly notice
able. Some of the players, who 
are not members of the regular 
team, played just as well as the 
regulars. Shaub made some star 
catches in middle field, after the 
ladies had departed, unhappily. 
Crawford was a good hitter for 
his side and helped considerably 
to keep up the score. Halferty 
made a couple of three baggers, 
and was not at all slow in giving 
advice to Umpire Decker. Wisner 
played a good game at third.

But all the page an awful black

Despair is come, and hope is

Ha! wretched flunkers, now

Yes, lost and ruined dullards, rack

On Friday evening, June 21, the 
class of 1909, of the M. M. C. S. 
will give their class dance. In 
our efforts to make this dance a 
success, we have possibly advanc
ed a little on the road toward ob
taining the true Bachelorship of 
Goodfellowship. With that same 
Good fellowship as a basis, we 
will next year be able to accom
plish more in every direction, 
than has been possible this year.
The dance will be held in the 
gymnasium of the Margaret Mor
rison Carnegie School. The 
gym will be simply but taste
fully decorated. While we are 
going to use the pennants of other 
schools, our Tartan, with what it 
means to every person there, will 
be given the place of honor. There 
will be plenty of cozy corners, but 
it is needless to say that with the 
judicious chaperoning, our fac
ulty has endeavored to establish.
Girls, why do we let the boys 
get ahead of us in the matter of 
self-government? They have the 
honor system, why cant we?
Miss Hoffman in Geography: 
Agriculture is carried 011 very 
extensively in Germany, They 
raise a great number of horses.
Mrs. Ho.wells gave the D 
division a very interesting talk on 
her fathers career in the Crimea. 
It is not often that we can hear of 
such great events from one who is 
so well acquainted with all the 
details.
Miss Isabelle Powelson has had 
to leave school on account of ill 
health. We trust that she may 
have a speedy recovery and return 
to us when the fall term opens.
This is the advice given to a 
certain class 011 how to relate a 
story:
When you want to tell the story, 
How the Bell of Atri was rung, 
Just let clauses, -words and 
phrases
Flow lightly from your tongue.
