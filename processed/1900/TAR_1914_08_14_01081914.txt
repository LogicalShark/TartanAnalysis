FIRST DIVISION GAMES 
END THIS AFTERNOON
WINNER IS NOT YET 
DETERMINED.
THREE SCHOLAR
SHIPS AWARDED
ALSO FOOTBALL AND TRACK 
LETTERS.
The final basketball games of the 
first division teams, which will take 
place this afternoon, promise to be the 
most exciting on the schedule. * To
gether with Tuesdays contests, they 
will decide the winner of the fraternity 
fives. Woodlawn Club has the best 
opportunity to land first place. Should 
it had lost its last game on Tuesday, 
Beta Theta Epsilon and Xi Sigma Upsilon must break even to tie it. Theta 
Xi still has a chance if it can win two 
of the final three games. Zeta Lambda 
Epsilon, Sigma Tau and Sigma Rho 
are out of the running.
During the week before vacation, 
Woodlawn Club and Xi Sigma Upsilon 
each won two games. The first men
tioned team was thus enabled to as
sume temporary possession at least, of 
first place; while the latter boosted 
its position from fifth to second, where 
it is on even terms with Beta Theta 
Epsilon and Theta Xi. Zeta Lambda 
Epsilon did the unexpected by drop
ping two games and its pennant hopes. 
Sigma Tau chalked up its first victory, 
a feat that Sigma Rho has yet to ac
complish.
The schedule of the second division 
ni'ade u pof school club teams will be 
published as soon as it is announced.

SOCCER FOOTBALL FOOTBALL TO BE (ONREPORTED FAVORABLY TINUED AT CARNEGIE
IMPORTANCE IN COLLEGE 
ATHLETICS.
At a general mass meeting, held 
Wednesday, December 17, the stu
dents of the School of Applied Sci
ence, with many of those in the other 
mens schools were gathered for an 
awakening of interest in student activ
ities. Insignia for football and for 
cross-country were awarded, under
graduates representing different or
ganizations spol^e and the awards of 
three scholarships were made.
The crowd of students filled every 
seat and took up all of the available 
standing room when Dean Leete open
ed the program. He spoke briefly on 
what athletics mean to the Institute, 
then gave place to Director of Ath
letics, McCulloch, who made the 
presentation of sweaters and insignia 
to the athletes.
Under the new rule, sweaters bear
ing C. A. A. were given to the cross
country team which won the Thanks
giving Day run held at Crafton. The 
same insignia was given to the men 
who had taken part in Varsity foot
ball games, but had fallen short of 
the requirements for the Varsity let
ter. The regulation sweater was 
awarded to the members of the Var
sity team. There were Capt. Clair, 
Capt.-elect McCaughey, Rulmer, 
Burke, Fagan, H. Hellstrom, Oakes, 
Welch, Balsinger, Kesner, Kreider, 
Lauer, Trautman, McDonald and 
Manager Haaren. The football men 
awarded the C. A. A. were Tyler, 
Oeffinger, Kindi, Parke and Fletcher.
To Haselton, MacMillan, Campbell 
and Handleman was given the C. A. 
A. for winning the cross country run.
Alan Bright, 11, interested the un
dergraduates with his ideas of what 
being on Carnegie Tech alumnus 
means.
H. J. McCorkle, it, as president of 
the Alumni Association, announced 
the award of two fifty dollar scholar* 
ships to a member of the Junior class 
in each of the two schools, Science 
and Design. J. P. Tumpane and J. 
W. Phillips were the recipients. Pres
ident McCorkle spoke of what the 
scholarship represented, and what the 
Alumni Association wanted it to 
mean.
The award of the 1913 scholarship 
was made by C. B. Kline. He rep
resented the last class to graduate in 
bestowing a sum of one hundred dol
lars upon a member of the present 
senior class. W. E. Culp was the

A NEW POLICY TO BE 
ADOPTED.
At the Inter-collegiate Conference 
held at New York on December 30, one 
of the most interesting reports of the 
conference was made by Committee on 
Soccer Football.
They reported a great increase in 
the number of students playing the 
game, especially in the east, though 
the game is fast taking hoi din the 
middle west.
In the colleges the game is being 
used as a means of general exercise, 
and to provide a game in which the 
majority of students may take part 
in. It is one of the best games we 
lave from a developmental and recre
ational standpoint.
When played in match competition 
hardly any game that we play requires 
or develops greater stamina, with the 
accompanying requisite of good heart, 
and lung power, and for this reason 
would prove a valuable asset in train
ing and developing our football men, 
during the off season. Match games 
consist of two periods of forty-five 
minutes each, and a ten-minute inter
mission, with practically no time out, 
and no substitutions allowed. Com
pare this with our rugby football, in 
which eight minutes is a good aver
age of the time the ball is actually 
in play, during a thirty-minute period, 
and you will gain a fair idea of the 
condition required of men who play 
in match games.
For recreational purposes the game 
is ideal. Played out of doors at almost 
any season of the year, it exercises 
the body vigorously, especially the 
vital organs, and requires no elaborate 
equipment. Efficient knowledge of 
the game may be acquired after two 
or three attempts, or make it pos
sible for almost anyone to play and 
enjoy it, though a high degree of skill 
may be developed with practice.
Columbia University this year 
played sixty match games, and now 
engages a coach for soccer alone.
Yale, Harvard, Princeton, and many 
of the other colleges in the east play 
the game as an inter-collegiate sport.
In Boston during the past year 
seven thousand school-boys played 
the game, and no injuries were record
ed, while rugby football claimed a 
total of thirty serious injuries among 
the school boys of the city.
It is hardly likely that soccer will 
ever take the place of the American 
game, but for general exercise, where
Just before the Christmas recess, the 
representative committee on the foot
ball situation met in the Directors of
fice, and tried to solve the question. 
The men present included the Admin
istrative Council and various students 
who have attained pre-eminence in stu
dent afifairs. It was the unanimous 
opinion of this committee that football 
ought to be continued at Carnegie on 
account of the high type of school 
spirit which it develops in institutions 
of learning in this country. The ques
tion remained then how we were to 
get at Carnegie a good football team, 
and whether football was consistent 
with the demands of a technical insti
tution.
The committee on scholarship re
quirements seemed to think that a 
technical institution could have a good 
football team, and in their report ar
ranged suitable hours for football men 
to practice, and planned means where
by such men could make up their 
school-work.
The Schedule Committee then pre
sented a report, in which they showed 
an evident desire to depart somewhat 
from the policy of last year. Instead 
of playing only the smaller schools of 
this vicinity, it was thought desirable 
to try to arrange games with some of 
the larger institutions of the country, 
and especially with those technical 
schools such as Case, Stevens, Rensellaer, and others, who have much 
the same conditions to meet as we 
have here. The report was adopted 
and the Football Manager was ad
vised to secure, if possible, such 
games next year.
The Alumni Association presented 
a letter to the committee, in which 
they showed their willingness to sup
port the schools in the matter of se
curing a football coach for next sea
son. A committee was appointed to 
look into this matter, and to report 
later.
It was the opinion of the entire com
mittee that with the enthusiasm 
shown and with the backing of the 
Alumni Association a football team 
might be trained next year which 
would be a credit to the institution.
time and space are limited, it is the 
best game we have for inter-school, 
and inter-class competition.

THE ENGINEERING
COMPETITION.
Elsewhere in this issue will be found 
the rules governing the competition 
which is being conducted by The Eng
ineers Society of Western Pennsyl
vania. As stated therein, the object 
is to promote engineering education 
qualities necessary to successful engi
neering practice. We congratulate the 
Engineers Society upon having insti
tuted this competition. We believe it 
will be of enormous benefit to the stu
dents taking part in it; and we believe 
it will also be of advantage to engi
neers in practice, as it will enable them 
to determine just what kind of courses 
students are getting in the various 
schools and what practical value these 
courses have. The schools which will 
enter the competition are representa
tive of this section of the country. The 
list includes Case, Ohio State Univer
sity, Penn State, the University of 
West Virginia, and Carnegie Institute 
of Technology. Tufts College of 
Boston, although outside of the dis
trict originally embraced in the propo
sition, asked to be permitted to com
pete, and the Engineers Society have 
decided to allow them to do so. The 
competition will be open to Senior 
and Junior Mechanicals, Senior Elec
tricals, and Senior Civils. We hardly 
need to urge those competing from our 
institution to do their best, because 
we know they will do so; and we hon
estly believe they will make a very 
good showing in the competition.
OUR HONEST ATHLETIC 
POLICY.
The policy of the Carnegie Insti
tute of Technology, we are proud to 
say, has always been to play fair with 
all other schools. No concessions are 
allowed our athletes; they must keep 
up their studies just like all the other 
students. As a result the representa
tives of Carnegie on athletic teams 
are always bona-fide students.
Men do not come here just because 
they are good football players, or be
cause they are wonderful baseball 
pitchers. They know such qualifica
tions alone will not be sufficient to 
gain them admission to the school, to 
say nothing of keeping them' here when 
once in. Possibly our teams might be 
a little stronger, if we did not have 
these high ideals; on the other hand, 
no true Carnegie man could have the 
high pride in a team of ringers that 
he has in our present honest teams.
We are glad to be able to print here
with a copy of the recommendation 
from one of the recent committees on 
the football situation. This recom
mendation is worthy of careful study 
by the students of Carnegie, and might 
also be of interest to students in other 
schools. It explains in no undecided 
terms the policy of the Institute with 
respect to athletics. It also clearly 
shows that the faculty of the schools 
here are not opposed to athletics, but 
are in entire sympathy with all lines 
of student endeavor; and are willing 
to do everything consistent with the 
honest policy above mentioned, in or
der to help the athletic teams.
The recommendation follows:
December 16th, 1913.
Director A. A. Hamerschlag,
Carnegie Institute of Technology. 
My Dear Director:
Your committee appointed to con
sider the question of scholarship re
quirements for the football squad begs 
leave to submit the following report:
1.It is the opinion of the commit
tee that members of athletic teams 
should be required to carry the normal 
schedule of studies and that the schol
arship ideals of the School should be 
maintained. In support of this con
clusion we urge:
(a) A technical training is the pri
mary object of every bona fide student.
(b) Without underestimating the 
value of athletic training such train
ing cannot in justice to the student be 
accepted as an equivalent for technical 
instruction.
(c) Discrimination should not be 
made between students engaged in ath
letics and those required to maintain 
themselves by outside employment or 
participating in other student activi
ties.
2.Current requirements in scholas
tic work can not be deferred until the 
close of the football season without 
handicapping the student to such an 
extent as practically to foredoom him 
to failure.
3.The present practice of excusing 
candidates for the football squad from 
laboratory work at four oclock, with 
the requirement that they make up 
such omitted work before the next ex
ercise in that subject, would in our 
opinion afford sufficient time to enable 
the team to obtain the necessary prac
tice to make a showing creditable to 
the Institution and at the same time 
need not jeopardise the standing of the 
student.
In order that this plan may accom
plish the desired results it is import
ant:
First, that football candidates be im
pressed with the fact that it is an 
agreement with which the Faculty is 
in sympathy.
Second, that arrangements be made 
to afford necessary facilities, by the 
provision of a tutor or otherwise, for 
making up omitted work.
4.It is the opinion of the Com
mittee that the best interests of the 
individual student and the greatest per
manent benefit to the team would be 
realized by regarding as eligible can
didates in 1914 those Plebes who shall 
have satisfactorily fulfilled all entrance 
requirements and that the Deans of
fice and the athletic officials co-operate 
in a constant supervision of the schol
arship standing of such Plebes during 
the football season. This recom
mendation is made withlhe possibility 
in mind of eliminating all Plebes from 
the football team in 1915, if that should 
then seem desirable.
5.It is further urged that the ath
letic authorities with the co-operation 
of the Dean bring as much pressure as 
possible to bear upon the members of 
the football squad to maintain scholar
ship standing throughout the remaind
er of the present year.
Respectfully submitted,
JOHN H. LEETE

A LETTER FROM DR. SUNDAY.
The following letter has been re
ceived from the Pittsburgh Evangel
istic Committee. It is to be hoped that 
many students will avail themselves 
of the invitation extended therein: 
Dear Prof. Hamerschlag:
We are planning a Students N ight 
at the tabernacle, Saturday, January 
10th, and are inviting the University, 
Tech, High School and Academy stu
dents. We want them to come with 
their banners, their yells and all the 
enthusiasm of youth. We hope also 
that they may bring their band, and 
have their yell leaders on hand.
We most cordially invite you, your 
teachers and your student body. If 
you will have your students meet at 
some point near the tabernacle, in or
der that they may march to the build
ing and enter in a body by 7:30 P. M., 
we shall have pleasure in making such 
reservations as you desire.
My secretary, Mr. Ackley, will be 
at the Bell phone, Schenley No. 2, to 
receive any messages regarding the 
number of seats desired. Such in
formation should be in our hands not 
later than 12 oclock noon, Thursday, 
January 8th.
With kind personal regards, 
Cordially yours,
(S.) W. A. Sunday.

COMPETITION IN ENGINEERIN PROBLEMS.
Conducted by The Engineers Society 
of Western Pennsylvania.
Rules Governing the Competition.
The Engineers Society of Western 
Pennsylvania, through its committee 
on Engineering Education, offers an 
annual competition open to students 
in technical institutions of collegiate 
rank.
The object of the competition is to 
promote engineering education, and in 
particular to co-operate with technical 
institutions in developing in students 
qualities essential to successful engi
neering practice.
The competition involves the solu
tion of a problem set and judged by 
representatives of the society. Prob
lems relating to different fields of en
gineering are offered, in order that 
the work of the competition may be 
readily co-ordinated with the course 
of instruction in which the student is 
registered.
In 1913-14 three problems will be 
set, one each in the fields of Civil, 
Electrical and Mechanical Engineer
ing.
The competition will be conducted 
under the following regulations:
First: Copies of the problems will
be sent on October 15, under seal, to 
the Deans of the Engineering Schools 
in which students will enter the com
petition. Upon receipt of advices as 
to the probable number of competiing students, printed copies of the 
problems will be forwarded to the 
Deans of the several Schools.
The students shall be allowed four 
months in which to solve the problems, 
which may be given to them on any 
date selected by the Dean of the En
gineering School in which the com
petition is being conducted.
Solutions must be in the hands of 
the Secretary of the Engineers So
ciety of Western Pennsylvania not 
later than May 1, 1914.
Second: The competition shall be
open to all regular students in either 
the Junior or Senior class at the op
tion of the Faculty, and may be en
tered either by individuals, or by two 
men working together.
In order that a candidate may be 
eligible for an award not less than 20 
per cent of the students registered in 
his Class and Department must sub
mit solutions.
Third: The competition shall be
conducted under the direction of the 
Engineering Schools in which the con
testants are registered.
The solutions shall represent strict
ly the work of the individual contest
ants without other assistance than di
rections concerning printed data and 
such general discussion as shall be 
consistent with honorable competition.
An explicit statement concerning 
sources of information and general 
procedure shall accompany each solu
tion.
Fourth: Solutions shall be num
bered and shall contain no other marks 
of identification of the institution or
individual. They shall conform to all 
the specifications accompanying the 
problem.
Fifth: A certificate of award shall 
be given in each of the fields in which 
the problems are set, and such number 
of mentions as the merit of the solu
tions and the number of competitors 
shall warrant.
Sixth: The solutions shall be ex
hibited in the rooms of the Engineers 
Society of Western Pennsylvania and 
that solution receiving the first award 
in each field shall be recommended 
for publication in the Proceedings of 
the Society, together with the names 
of men receiving mentions.

M. M. C. S. NEWS
DR. ADALINE M. WATSON OF 
MARGARET MORRISON CAR
NEGIE SCHOOL DIES.
The second death in the faculty of 
Carnegie Institute of Technology, 
causing alterations in plans for fes
tivities, came December 16th in the 
death of Dr. Adaline M. Watson, a 
member of the faculty of the Margaret 
Morrison Carnegie School.
The first death was that of Charles 
Russell Hewlett, dean of the School 
of Design, which occurred just pre
vious to the Carnegie Day celebration, 
November 25. Because of that the 
pageant planned in honor of Andrew 
Carnegie was omitted.
As a tribute to Dr. Watson, a Christ
mas pageant to have been given by 
the Dramatic and Glee Clubs of the 
school in the gymnasium, has been 
postponed until January 6. Besides 
this, all classes in physical education 
at the school, in which Dr. Watson 
was specially interested, was dis
missed. Four members of the faculty 
represented the school at the funeral 
services.
For two years Dr. Watson had held 
the position of consulting physician 
of the faculty of Margaret Morrison. 
Her duties were to examine girls upon 
entrance and to take care of all ill
nesses and diseases which developed 
in the school. Besides this she was 
on the staff of Columbia Hospital, 
Wilkinsburg.
Dr. Watson resided at 6368 Aurelia 
street. She was born in Cadiz, O., 
and spent her early days there. She 
attended Franklin College in Phila
delphia, receiving her degree in 1888. 
She then attended the Womans Med
ical College in Philadelphia, receiving 
the degree of M. D. in 1898.
For a year Dr. Watson practiced 
in the West Philadelphia Hospital, 
then came to Pittsburgh and has since 
practiced here.
She was a member of the Allegheny 
County Medical Society, and of the 
Womans Medical Society of Pitts
burgh, having been president of the 
latter organization. She was an active

BASEBALL SCHEDULE OUT.
Carnegie Tech students are measur
ing up their chances for a winning 
baseball team next spring, and are 
waiting for the call for early indoor 
practice which is to be issued soon. 
The new material will be subjected 
to the most rigorous examination this 
year, for graduation lost some of the 
best players that Tech has ever had. 
Left Fielder Vail, Shortstop Gearhart 
and First Baseman Moorhead all left 
the school in June and new men must 
be found to fill the positions that they 
occupied during the four years of their 
college courses. Each man had been 
a captain in the last three seasons and 
were reckoned among the best in the 
local collegiate game.
Another loss since last season was 
that of Roy Hoerr, who made a record 
for himself while with the Tartan team 
as the star pitcher.
Besides the new recruits expected, 
Tech has some good men to rely on 
to fill some of the vacancies. Several 
of these were used in a few games last 
year and will be nursed carefully to 
develop varsity material. The pitch
ing staff will be built around Urquhart and Hines, who won a good per
centage of the games in which they 
were used last season. Several others 
who pitched for the second team are 
expected to develop into first-class 
men this spring.
The new rule in effect this year 
barring night students from varsity 
athletics will limit the supply of new 
material somewhat, but no serious 
handicap is feared since the number 
of students following the day courses 
is large enough to supply all of the 
material that can be handled by the 
coaches.
The followers of the fortunes of the 
Tech team are deriving a large amount 
of satisfaction from the fact that they 
will have a veteran man back of the 
home plate this year. Lain showed 
proimse of making a star catcher at 
the close of last season and the coach
es look for even better performance 
this year. Other letter men remaining 
are Hall, Brine, Kauffman, Kirk and 
DeMuth.
Manager W. Frazier Routh has put 
his schedule in shape with the excep
tion of one or two games. An East
ern trip is planned, but is not certain 
as yet. As it now stands, the schedule 
is the strongest ever arranged for a 
Carnegie nine. Relations in the sport 
have been reopened with Pitt and W.
& J., two games with each school being 
scheduled. Penn State is down for 
but one contest, which will be played 
in Pittsburgh. The strongest teams 
in West Virginia as well as in West
ern Pennsylvania will be met, and Tech 
should earn a lot of credit if it suc
ceeds in cleaning up the better part
of the list. The schedule follows:
April 18Pitt at Pittsburgh.

INDUSTRY PLEBES HOLD 
SWIMMING PARTY.
The Plebes of the School of Applied 
Industries held a Swimming Party at 
the Oakland Natatorium1 Wednesday, 
December 17, 1913, which was a huge 
success.
The Plebes, under the leadership of 
C. A. Parker, their President, started 
the ball of success rolling when they 
staged at the gymnasium a smoker 
which has been the talk of the school 
ever since. In this swimming party 
they have given, the so-called ball of 
success of the Plebe Class, another 
push which sends it onward with more 
momentum.
From the way they enter into any 
of their class or school activities it 
looks as though the ball will never lack 
willing hands to keep up the momen
tum it now possesses.
THE INDUSTRIAL BOOSTERS 
SOCIETY GIVES DINNER 
TO STUDENTS.
The Boosters Society of the Indus
trial School made its first attempt to 
better the student welfare of their 
school, when they gave a Xmas din
ner to those students who were not 
going home for the holidays. The pur
pose of the dinner was to give these 
students a real feeling of Xmas and if 
possible reduce that melancholy feel
ing which haunts a man when he is 
away from home at Xmas. The dinner 
answered its purpose for everybody 
present seemed to forget their troubles 
and enjoyed the dinner as well as the 
goodfellowship which existed very 
prominently.
Dean Connelley dropped in for a 
few minutes and gave a very nice talk 
which helped very much in the purpose 
of the dinner.
The dinner all told was very suc
cessful although the number present 
was small, they easily made up this 
deficiency by the way they entered 
into the occasion.

REPORT OF THE STUDENT AC
TIVITIES FUND FROM NOV. 
21, 1912, TO DEC. 26, 1913.
True ValuesB. & B.True Values
To the Tartan Readers:
A very interesting announcement 
has just been made, the opening of a 
new department in the School of Ap
plied Design which possesses such 
novelty that it would seem worthy of 
a special word from the Dean. The 
beginning of a School of Drama in 
America, in which the Dramatic Arts 
are to be offered to students, marks 
an entirely new educational period. 
There exists in America no private 
theatre with a faculty gathered to
gether for the purpose of giving a 
professional education to those who 
propose to make Dramatic Arts the 
basis of their careers. Other educa
tional institutions have from time to 
time interested themselves in this field 
to the extent of offering courses on the 
literary side of the Drama. Still others 
have in a semi-amateurish way devel
oped student activities in that direction 
but nowhere in America has an edu
cational institution offered an oppor
tunity for a complete course in this 
field leading to a Bachelor of Arts 
Degree in the Drama.
In this pioneer work we have been 
fortunate in the choice of a Head for 
this Department. Thomas Wood 
Stevens, Professor in Charge, has had 
a rounded experience in this field. At 
the present moment he is in St. Louis, 
where he has written the theme for a 
great historical pageant of the city, and 
in collaboration with Percy Mackeye, 
has retained to develop this unique 
celebration. He will be aided in his 
work by actors of reputation and abil
ity. From the scenic and pageantry 
side he is individually one of the best 
equipped men in America and will find 
valuable assistance tendered him from 
the Departments of Painting and Dec
oration. In the literary side of the 
work Professor Geoghegan expects to 
carry the major part of the work. The 
Department of Music is ready to lend 
its forces for the benefit of the work. 
Thus it will be seen that we have pro
vided an environment, a laboratory, 
and a faculty which gives promise to 
prospective students of an exception
al opportunity for their professional 
development.
It is hoped that we will be able to 
inaugurate and open the theatre on 
Shakespeares birthday, April 23rd, 
1914. A student production will sig
nalize the occasion. Between now and 
the opening of the first semester stu
dents of both sexes are invited to en
roll in this course, details of which 
are fully outlined in the new catalogue 
which is about to issue. The influence 
of this department should be particu
larly felt among the entire student 
body of the institution. No courses 
will find a greater welcome by the in
dividuals in our faculties. It needs 
but the support of the Pittsburgh 
community to make it one of the most 
commendable educational movements 
inaugurated by the Carnegie Institute 
of Technology.

A STATEMENT.
Two recent editorials in The Tar
tan reveal a considerable amount of 
misinformation and misunderstanding 
concerning the Student Activities 
Fund and its administration. If these 
are shared by the student body in 
general, it would seem desirable to 
point out the actual facts about the 
matter. That is the purpose of the 
following statement.
The student activities fund is made 
up of a contribution of one dollar by 
each day student in the mens schols, 
and fifty cents by each night student.
It is collected at the office of the Bur
sar from the registration fees at en
trance, and turned over to the stu
dent treasurer of the Activity Fund 
by a committee of student auditors 
appointed by the president of the 
Board of Delegates. The money is 
always in the hands of the students 
themselves.
Applications for appropriations from 
the fund are made directly to the Stu
dent Board of Control. Such aplications as are approved by the Student 
Board then come before the Faculty 
Committee on Sutdent Activities. This 
committee has the power to approve 
the application, to suggest modifica
tions of it or to veto it outright. Au
thorized payments from the fund are 
made by check drawn by the student 
treasurer and countersigned by the 
secretary of the Student Activities 
Committee.
In its administration of the fund the 
committee on student activities has 
followed general principle. In the 
first place, it has always tried to in
duce themselves to take an intelligent 
interest in the administration of the 
fund. For several years their efforts 
in that direction met with little suc
cess. Under the present arrangement, 
however, the committee are pleased to 
note an improvement in that rspect.
In the second place, the committee 
believes that what aid should be given 
generously to deserving student activ
ities when they need it, every effort 
should be made to put the activities on 
a self-supporting basis. Long con
tinued alms-giving will tend to pau
perize and generally demoralize an 
organization as much as an individual. 
Partly, at least, as a result of its ef
forts and advice the Glee and Man
dolin Club and the Thistle have for 
two years paid their own way. In 
marked contrast with their record is 
that of the White Friars. That organ
ization received aid from' the fund to 
the amount of several hundred dollars 
for three years in succession. The 
total amount given them was consid
erably over a thousand dollars. At 
the end of the time they were in no 
better condition financially than at 
the beginning. It seemed impossible 
to persuade them to manage their af
fairs with good business judgment, as 
even to keep their financial records 
in intelligent shape. The committee 
concluded that they were being injured 
rather than benefited by the assist
ance they were receiving, and refused 
to let them have any more money until 
they changed their methods.

or any similar fonctions given by Carnegie Tech Students
W. R. KUHN CO.
Finally the committee has acted on 
the principle that in their capacity as 
trustees of the students fund, it was 
their duty to see to it that the money 
was expended only in ways beneficial 
to considerable groups of students. 
In their judgment it is not so impor
tant that the money should be spent, 
or that it should be wisely spent. The 
fund can never be administered on 
the principle of quid pro quo. Neither 
each student nor each class can ex
pect to get back an exact equivalent 
of its contribution. Nor should there 
be any feeling that the amount col
lected each year should be expended 
during the same year. There are 
years during which it would be sim
ply impossible to spend wisely the en
tire amount collected; and surely the 
students themselves would, not advo
cate spending it unwisely for the sim
ple purpose of getting rid of it.
One result of the policy of the com
mittee has been the accumulation of 
a surplus in the fund, and as more or
ganizations become self-supporting, 
the surplus will accumulate more rap
idly. The committee feels, however, 
that occasions will arise in the future 
when large appropriations from the 
fund may be wisely made. They an
ticipate such an opportunity in the 
near future in connection with the 
equipment of the rooms to be set 
aside for the social uses of the stu
dents in the administration Building 
now under construction. If the time 
ever comes when it is found that more 
money is being collected than can be 
wisely expended, the remedy would 
seem to be, not to embark on a career 
of reckless expenditure, but to reduce 
somewhat the amount of the assess
ment.
Finally, it seems necessary to state 
that the Faculty Committee has only 
one purpose in all its actions, and that 
is to co-operate heartily with the Stu
dent Board of Control in the assist
ance of all mentioned student activi
ties.
For the committee,
Wm. P. Field, Chairman.

PROFESSOR WURTS CHRIST
MAS GIFT TO HIS ELEC
TRICAL CLASSES.
On Friday morning, December the 
19th, in Room 11, Machinery Hall, 
Professor Wurts entertained his soph
omore electrical class with an interest
ing and instructive lecture on the for
eign cruise which he took last summer.
The talk was a description of the 
trip of Professor Wurts and his party 
from England down to Gibraltar and 
then along the African coast to the 
Canary Islands, stopping at several 
Moorish cities. A number of post
cards projected on the screen helped 
greatly to visualize the lecture.
Professor Wurts, while talking of 
the peculiar dress of the Moorish 
women, broke out, but after all, its 
much more decent than the present 
American fashions with slit skirts and 
peek-a-boo clothing.
His description of the crowded 
Moorish streets and their white-walled 
cities which look like cities of the dead 
at a distance, but become teeming with 
life the minute you enter, was es
pecially interesting. An instance of 
Moorish business methods was given 
in his purchase of a shawl whose price 
descended in a few moments from 
twenty to four dollars; and the con
tempt of the Mohammedans for the 
Christian infidels he described as 
shown by their spitting upon the 
ground whenever a member of the 
party passed them.

H. HORELICKCHESS CHAM
PION, 4-3.
The winning of the seventh game of 
the remarkable set of chess tourna
ment finals by H. Horelick, Sopho
more Mechanical, against C. Thomas 
Patterson, Junior Metallurgist, decided 
the championship.
The champion was a dark horse who 
appeared in chess only this year, while 
the other player in the finals has been 
recognized as the leading chessman 
around school for some time. The 
former plays his own game, regardless 
of chess books, but the latter is a firm 
adherent of the standard plays, and 
is an artist of the Kings Gambit. Only 
the long experience of Horelick saved 
him before Pattersons wide knowl
edge of chess plays.
At the outset Horelick won two out 
of a necessary three and Patterson ad
mitted that things looked blue. But 
determining to make Horelick play 
hard in spite of his lead, he tried the 
third game, won the next two, and 
tied again, leaving the score 3-3, and 
six games played. A rule of the tourna
ment was three out of five games, but 
at no time did either have this, so they 
faced the second extra game whose re
sult was to decide the championship.
On Wednesday, December the 17th, 
Patterson played hard to win his up
hill fight, but luck and the choice of 
men was against him, for the plays 
best with white and Horelick had
these. So Horelick, with a clever 
checkmate, became champion of the 
Science School, as decided by the First 
Annual Chess Tournament
The interest shown in this new in
stitution of the Science School leads 
all to hope for another next year, and 
many have suggested that the tourna
ment be extended to between schools, 
whose separate champions might com
pete for the championship of the In
stitute.
MHO CLUB MEETING.

J. C. Sproull was the feature of the

107, Machinery Hall, on Wednesday, 
December the 17th. The lecture took 
up separately, described and discussed 
the various forms of motors, transmis
sion, differentials, rear axles and steer
ing gear, together with such other 
points as came up in answering the 
questions. The explanation of the ad
vantages and disadvantages of the dif
ferent types of automobile machinery 
was very interesting and calculated to 
enable one hearing to understand the 
specifications and salesmens state
ments concerning any car.
At the close of the lecture, Presi
dent Sontum, in behalf of the Mho 
Club, thanked the Mechanical Society 
for the invitation to the lecture, after 
which the electrical club continued 
thtir program in Room 104.
Mr. Liebold was the student speaker 
of the evening, his subject being The 
Nitrogen Filled Lamp. The large 
size, high candle power, and brilliancy 
per unit area to which is due its com
mercial application for concentrated 
light, were taken up, and several inter
esting comparisons were tabulted on 
the board.
The business of the meeting con
sisted in arranging for clubroom 
bookcase, the binding of several years 
of current electrical magazines owned 
by the club, and in explaining the new 
system of each member being pro
vided with a clubroom key upon the 
deposit of a quarter.

Now, it is up to every undergrad
uate to be in the Field House when the 
team comes oin the floor. The best 
way to keep the players from lying 
down on the job is to be in the root
ing section. And that is the only 
thing that we need fear.
The team is practically one of last 
years veterans. Capt. Criswell, Col
vin, Hines, Tumpane, and Douthett, 
all have played for Carnegie and know 
what they are up against. The team 
work is not lacking, neither is the 
speed, nor the individual ability. All 
that is needed to clean up every game 
on the schedule is for the fellows to 
take the jump and keep it. And, oh, 
yes,we need the support of the stu
dentsdont forget that. So count on 
being there.

CLASSIFIED LIST OF TARTAN ADVERTISERS
We have classified our advertisers so that our readers may use the list 
for reference before making purchases. The grouping furnishes an excellent 
variety of merchants for any article which a student, alumnus or faculty 
member would be likely to buy, and there is no valid reason of which we are 
aware that would justify anyone interested in the welfare of The Tartan in 
making purchases from any but merchants who so kindly make such a publi
cation possible. Be sure, also, to give one of the purchase stubs, which you 
will find enclosed in your Tartan every other week, to the clerk from whom 
you make the purchase. The stubs, we have found, make pleased advertisers 
and help to get new ones. May we depend upon YOU to take this as a re
sponsibility to your Institution and to The Tartan.

Despite the efforts of a number of 
students who have been working the 
past four months to have the J-Hop 
restored to favor, there will be no 
junior hop this year, according to a 
resolution of the senior senate passed 
this week. The anfiual J-Hop was 
abolished by a resolution of the senate 
on February 14, after it had been a 
continuous Michigan institution for 
almost 40 years. It was stated at the 
time that the sentiment of the senate 
was that the hop had grown to such 
a size which made it unmanageable 
and too elaborate and also undemo
cratic and exclusive. The abolition of 
the hop was precipitated by the riotous 
attempt of about three hundred stu
dents and others to force admission to 
the gymnasium while the festivities 
were going on, and by the freaky char
acter of the dancing costumes and mus
ic and because it was felt that the hop 
was the occasion of too much extrava
gance. Immediately after the action 
of the Senate last year the 1914 hop 
committee set to work in the endeavor 
to have the hop reinstated, which re
sulted in their failure this week.
