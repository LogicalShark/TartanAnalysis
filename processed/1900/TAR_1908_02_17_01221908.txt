Notices to appear in the Calendar 
should be in the hands of the edi

The matter of an enclosed athletic 
field is again to the fore and the 
matter of an increased contribution 
to student organization has again 
been voted on. Unfortunately the 
students do not understand the status 
of the matter. The desire to promote 
student organizations even at the 
expense of increased contributions is 
commendable, but the student body 
should understand thoroughly in 
what way the money is to be spent.
The first proposition and the one 
most generally understood to be the 
pending one is that tl^e students lease 
the property opposite the Hotel Schenley, the school authorities agreeing to 
build grandstands, dressing moms, 
etc., if the student body would lease 
the ground and grade it. This prop
osition would secure to the schools 
an athletic field immediately, also 
one under our own control; but would 
effect a solution on a rental basis 
only.
There has been another proposition 
made recently. A local amusement 
concern offers to relieve the school of 
its share in the expense if they be al
lowed the privilege of using the 
grounds at the times they would not 
be in use by the schools. This ar
rangement would undoubtedly let the 
schools out with a smaller outlay; 
but would bring outside parties into 
consideration in the arrangement of 
playing schedules and practice times. 
While we have assurances that they
would not care to use the grounds at 
times the students would use them, 
the knowledge that very few amuse
ment enterprises are run solely on a 
philanthropic basis should make the 
average student cautious.
There is a third solution that has 
been broached in some quarters. It 
is that the student body devote the 
amount that would be expended in 
ground rental toward constructing the 
stadium as surveyed at the head of 
the ravine. The rough estimates 
show that an amount about equal to 
two years rental would suffice to 
place this stadium in shape. Of course 
the entire amount would not be forth
coming at once but the board of trus
tees would in all probability be will
ing to advance the amount necessary 
above the student contributions of the 
first year. This scheme, while the 
initial expense would be large and 
while it would seem like dumping 
money into the ravine would effect 
a permanent settlement of the entire 
matter, as the field once in shape 
would belong absolutely to the schools 
and there would be no large annual 
rental fee.
The first two schemes then offer 
solutions of the matter immediately; 
but leave us at the expiration of our 
lease in exactly the position we oc
cupy to-day. The last scheme in
volves a larger initial outlay but se
cures to the students something of 
permanent value. It may be that a

---------------------------------------------------

4THE TARTAN
compromise between the various 
schemes might be brought about, the 
grounds near the Schenley being 
leased for immediate use and the 
stadium started at the same time. In 
any case the students should inform 
themselves of the exact status of the 
matter and should make it a point to 
make themselves heard on the matter.

An Ode to Crabtree.
(Sing a Song of Sixpence.)'
Sing a song of Crabtree,
Seats all filled with chaps,
Four and twenty minerals 
Dropping in our laps.
When our books are open 
We all know how to read,
And the crystallography 
Eat it up with greed.
Heres a mashed-down flattened cube, 
The indices, a cinch,
All are one, one, one, you know,
The distance by the inch.
What system does that belong,
With the corner chewed away?
The isometric, says the lad,
As his eyes oer the pages stray.
Then well blow ourselves to death, 
With a thing they call a pipe,
And put some acid in a tube 
And our Bunsen burners light.
Soon a man let out a yell,
The class as one man rose,
And then our teacher gently said: 
Hes only burnt his nose.
It was our little hippo,
Two ton is light for him.
Our Dot sits on a little chair
That should hold about half of him.
Then up and spake our Lubo,
A valiant scholar he.
A count from Punxsutawney 
Of the best nobility.
Ive got a mineral here, he said.
It looks like meed to me.
Ill put it down this fellows neck 
To test its symetry.
He found the cleavage perfect;
It slid down to the knee,
And Lubo got one in the eye 
Just to help his breakage fee.
But then the door flew open,
The gang from there did flee 
And left our Professor Crabtree 
And his crystallography.

Working of Large Gas Engines.
At a meeting of the British Society 
of Engineers a paper was read by 
Mr. G. Moore on the working of large 
gas engines. During the past few 
years the use of large gas engines 
has increased to a remarkable ex
tent, but very little information as to 
their characteristics and behaviour 
has been given. The author divided 
Continental engines into three differ
ent types:The double acting 4-cycle
type, the Ochelhauser and Korting 
types. The two last named have an 
advantage over the Otto in that watercooled exhaust valves are unnecessary. 
The thermal and mechanical effi
ciency of the Korting type are low, 
and trouble has arisen with the pis
ton owing to its great size and weight. 
Some designers have made the piston 
in three pieces in order to overcome 
the difficulties. Owing to the com
plicated shape of the cylinder head 
it is liable to crack, and it has been 
shown by experience that the great
est wear takes place in the middle of 
the cylinder near the exhaust ports. 
It is still doubtful whether it is ex
pedient to chamber the tail-rods, and 
experience shows that tail-rods are of 
no great advantage in engines of less 
than 500 h. p. One of the most per
sistent troubles in the running of 
large gas engines is the liability of 
pre-ignition, and with cylinders of 
about 24 inches in diameter preignition is never entirely absent 
when using producer gas. Mond gas, 
as shown by the experience of the 
author, is satisfactory for larger en
gines when reasonable care is taken. 
Gases with a large percentage of hy
drogen are not very suitable because 
the hydrogen ignites at comparatively 
low temperature, and a high percent
age of this gas tends to cause pre
ignition. In the 4-cycle type of en
gine the question of positive scav
enging has not yet been settled. With 
producer gas it has been found that 
the by-pass governor valve, commonly 
used on the Korting engine, does 
not work satisfactorily.Engineering

Clearing-House Certificates.
The meaning of the term ClearingHouse Certificate varies according to 
the kind of deposit made with the 
Clearing-House Association. When 
gold has been deposited the term is 
Clearing-House Certificate; when col
lateral has been deposited, the term 
is Clearing-House loan certificate.
October, 1907, will always be mem
orable for the financial catastrophe 
which overwhelmed the country, 
bringing the suspension of numerous 
financial institutions; causing runs 
on many banks and trust companies, 
and compelling the Associated Banks 
in New York and many other cities 
to resort to the issue of ClearingHouse certificates.
The distrust and lack of confidence 
which were fundamental in causing 
this state of affairs had their origin 
long ago; the more immediate causes 
for the upheaval were many. The 
Presidents speeches made during the 
trip down the Mississippi river, were 
somewhat unguarded; various ad
verse conditions developed; the cop
per trade was a cause of great dis
turbance, and there were multiplying 
evidences of a great reaction in the 
iron and steel trades and a falling-off 
in the activities of the business world 
generally. The long-continued de
cline in American securities had 
financially weakened many holders of 
such securities abroad and had cre
ated a general feeling of distrust in 
Europe concerning American prop
erties. The two combined led to a 
very extensive selling in our market 
of securities held by foreigners, and 
this naturally caused further severe 
breaks here. The passing of their 
dividends by two traction properties, 
namely, the Detroit United Raliways 
Company, and the Toledo Railways 
and Light Company, caused a semipanic on the Montreal Stock Ex
change.
The further decline in copper prices 
brought with it an utter collapse in 
all copper securities. The Mercantile 
National Bank became involved in the 
downfall of the Heinzes and the col
lapse of copper properties and Mr. 
P. Augustus Heinze, the president, 
was forced to resign. Upon examina
tion by the Clearing-House Commit
tee, the bank was declared entirely 
solvent and the Clearing-House de
cided to supply the needful amount 
of cash to carry it through.
The National Bank of North Amer
ica and the New Amsterdam National 
Bank were also under investigation; 
these being banks with which Charles 
W. Morse, who was associated with 
Mr. Heinze in the Mercantile Na
tional Bank, had become closely con
nected. The Clearing-House Commit
tee found these banks solvent also 
and determined to help them as well. 
As a preliminary, it was considered 
essential that Mr. Morse sever his 
connection with all the banking insti
tutions in which he had any interest, 
and it was determined that Edward 
R. Thomas and Orlando P. Thomas 
pursue the same course. This was 
done with the view of restoring con
fidence. One effect was to make the 
public suspicious of any institution 
with which any of these men had pre
viously been connected, no matter 
how remotely.
The suspension of the Knickerbock
er Trust Company; the assignment of 
the Stock Exchange firm of Mayer & 
Co.; the run on the Trust Company 
of America; the appointment of re
ceivers for the different Westinghouse concerns, and the closing of 
the Pittsburg Stock Exchange fol
lowed. Smaller banks and trust com
panies had runs and a number sus
pended. These were followed by the 
closing of the Union Trust Company 
of Providence, R. I., and the suspen
sion of other institutions in New 
York, causing a general crisis in 
financial affairs.
Mr. J. P. Morgan stepped into the 
breach backed by the banking and 
financial interests in New York and 
greatly aided by the action of the 
.Secretary of .the Treasury, Mr. Cortelyou. The New York ClearingHouse decided to issue Clearing-House 
certificates, and the next week the 
Clearing-Houses in other centers 
took similar action. Finally $24,- 
000,000 in gold was imported.
Pittsburg was burdened with a 
goodly share of these financial diffi
culties. In this city the crisis came 
suddenly. It was generally under
stood that money was tight 'and 
stocks had declined, but the difficul
ties of the Westinghouse concerns 
brought matters to a climax.
The Pittsburg Clearing-House As
sociation requested that the Stock
Exchange be closed to prevent need
less sacrifices of stocks. They also 
decided to issue Clearing-House loan 
certificatesthe first since 1893for 
the settlement of Clearing-House bal
ances. These certificates were am
ply secured by approved securities, 
and thus the banks were enabled to 
retain their cash for other require
ments.
The next factor to be dealt with 
was the enormous pay-roll of this 
district, amounting to over $1,000,000 
per day.* The issue of pay-roll checks 
in denominations of $5, $i0 and $20 
was decided upon and later $1 and $2 
checks were issued. These checks 
were payable only through the 
Clearing House. Several national 
banks made arrangements for addi
tional circulation amounting to $1,- 
000,000; and, in addition to this, the 
First National Bank imported from 
London $500,000 in gold. This was 
the first purchase of foreign gold 
ever made by a Pittsburg bank.
The $80,000,000 of gold imported, 
together with the increase in national-bank-circulation, will help, if not 
cure, the present tightness in the 
money market.

Cutting Off His Nose to Spite His 
Face.
One of our readers writes to say 
that there should be a lawsome peo
ple would cure earache with a law 
against allowing American machinery 
manufacturers to sell any of their 
products abroad.
He says that it puts into the hands 
of foreigners the tools to make every
thing to compete with America. He 
paints a lurid picture of American 
machines making guns to level New 
York and ravish the Jersey Meadows. 
It ends in a give-me-liberty-or-giveme-death peroration that makes the 
flag flutter in a dead calm and turns 
down a corner of the Constitution at 
page eleven.
Its pure rot, but just as true as 
the contention that if no European 
advertising is published in American 
papers, Americans will do more busi
ness in Europe.
We dont want all the machine-tool 
trade of Europe---we want a small per 
cent, of itand that will keep us 
busy.
Try for some of it.American Ma
chinist.

La grippe has laid its most severe 
hand upon our faculty, we regret to 
say. Six of the staff were absent one 
day, and Miss Stutz and Mr. Esquerre 
are still away. We hear Mr. Es
querre is very ill and will not be able 
to resume his duties for a long time, 
much to the sorrow of all his pupils. 
All join in wishing him a speedy re
covery. Miss iStutz is much better 
and will soon be back again.
During the past week, owing to so 
much illness, many of the classes 
have had no regular recitations. Miss 
Smith and Miss West, however, filled 
many of the gaps; Miss Arrowsmith 
also proved herself invaluable, devel
oping unexpected versatility. We 
knew that she was an authority in 
English, Arithmetic, Algebra, etc., 
but we had never suspected her of 
Chemistry, Physics and Greek.
Miss West gave a lecture on the 
small republic of San Marino, in the 
northeastern part of Italy, which was 
especially interesting. This republic 
is the oldest in the world and has al
ways been independent, even in its 
religion, except for a few months, 
when the Pope tried to force it to 
come under his power. This he 
failed to do, however.
San Marino is presided over by two 
captains and a council; the election 
of these officials is so simple, and 
prevents so much friction that the 
United States might well adopt their 
method. The names of the candi
dates are enclosed in ivory balls and 
these are then put inside of a large 
gold vessel somewhat the shape of 
a soup turreen. While the priest 
holds the vessel a small boy chooses 
an ivory ball and the man whose 
name is enclosed is at once elected.
On Monday the Household Arts 
class accompanied Miss West to the 
Carnegie Institute, and heard a very
interesting talk upon food and tex
tiles, illustrated by the exhibits pre
sented by Mr. Carnegie to the insti
tute.-----o---
Eighteenth Century.
A speech delivered two generations 
ago by a Mrs. Skinner on Mans 
Place in the Social Order:
Miss President, feller wimmen, 
and male trash ginerally, I am here 
to-day for the purpose of discussing 
womans rights, recussing her wrongs 
and cussing the men.
I believe sexes were created per
fectly equal, with the woman a little 
more equal than the man.
I believe that the world to-day 
would be happier if man never ex
isted.
As a success man is a failure, and
I bless my stars my mother was a 
woman.
I noit only maintain those princi
ples, but maintain a shiftless husband 
besides.
They say man was created. First, 
well, spose he was. Aimt first ex
periments always failures?
* The only decent thing about man 
was a rib, and that went to make 
something better.
And they throw into our faces 
taking an apple. Ill bet five dollars 
that Adam boosted her up the tree 
and only gave her the core.
And what did lie do when he was 
found out? True to his masculine 
instincts, he sneaked behind Eve and 
said, Twant me! twas her, and 
woman had to father everything and 
mother it too.
What we want is the ballot, and 
the ballot were bound to have, and 
swim in a sea of gore.

A lecture on Economics delivered 
by Prof. Willett at the M. M. C. S.: 
It is no longer a question whether 
woman shall have the ballot or 
whether she shall not; that has been 
decided in the affirmative. She al
ready has the ballot in some of the 
western States, and it will not be 
long before she will have it in all 
the States. It will come in your day, 
young ladies, and the question now 
is, What will you do with it?

I NINETEEN TWELVE |
1912NIGHT
John L. Hoffman, Correspondent.
The class meeting held on the 10th 
cannot be considered a success, as 
there were not enough members 
present to make up a quorum. Those 
who were present aired their various 
views of the social question and de
cided to call a meeting for the 17th. 
At the meeting last Friday, the 17th, 
the various committees were heard 
from and a committee, consisting of 
Vice President Keagy, Chairman, and 
Messrs. Parker (A-l), Swinbank 
(D-l), and Maisch (C-l), was appoint
ed by President Helm to settle the 
class colors question and report at the 
next regular class meeting. The rest 
of the evening was given over to the 
discussion of the social question, and 
it was decided to ask each member 
of the class for a contribution to a 
class fund for social purposes, etc. 
Just at this stage of the proceedings 
the lights went out and the class 
discovered what a capable Marshal we 
have. Mr. Skeehan very quickly 
hunted up a lantern and the class 
meeting was continued in an orderly 
manner in the flickering lantern light.
Talk seems to be sum total of class 
spirit of some fellows.
The cry of hard times doesnt seem 
to be making much of an impression 
on our president.
It seems that there were one or two 
who have never got an F or an L. 
We bet they feel rather lonely. Will 
you be gracious enough to tell how 
tis done, O, Most Favored Few?
Some one has said that President 
Helm thinks twice before he speaks. 
That may be, but he doesnt take 
time for that when you mention finan
cial aid for the class. Would that 
there were more of his kind.
Those who were not in a position 
to contribute to the .class fund will 
be given an opportunity to show 
their class spirit this week. No use
trying to dodge the money-man. He 
is like Pecks Bad Boy, always show
ing up when not wanted. This man 
has a thankless job so, if you cant 
give him any of the stuff that talks 
and is the root of all evil, at least 
give him the glad hand and the 
answer that turneth away wrath.
Mr. Weber (D-l) wants to know 
how fast a railroad train is going 
when it is running at the rate of 60 
miles per hour? We don't know, we 
are sure. Perhaps some of our read
ers could enlighten him.
According to Mr. Hower, Sir Isaac 
Newton had a hair-raising experience 
a few years back. It seems that the 
said Newton was lying under an ap
ple tree one warm day in the good 
old summer time, and the treeyes, 
the treefell down and hit him on 
the nose! Mr. Hower failed to 
state what became of Sir Isaacs nose.
Wayman, Leety and Keagy were 
recently transferred from D-l to B-l. 
Their friends of D dont know whether 
to offer sympathy or congratulations. 
How are they treating you up there, 
fellows?
Rees Griffith has asked Messrs. 
Lonergan, Laughlin, Finch and Far
rell to serve on the social committee. 
This committee has harder work and 
more of it than any other and the 
undivided support of the class should 
be theirs. They have the rather diffi
cult and thankless job of making the 
members of the class acquainted with 
each other and any advice you can 
give, or any aid which you can ex
tend will be worth its weight in gold, 
and appreciated accordingly.
Season tickets for the basket-ball 
games at hime can be obtained from 
John H. Wayman (B-l). Every mem
ber of the class should have one. 
Four bits plus a dime.
J. Howard Tritsohler, whom you 
will all remember as the former edi
tor of this page, was compelled to 
leave school and the engineering pro
fession altogether on account of seri
ous trouble with his eyes. He has 
just undergone an operation which 
all his friends are glad to hear was 
successful. His numerous classmates wish him success, and lots 
of it, in his future position.

EDITORIAL.
William P. Field, A.B., Secretary of 
the Carnegie Technical Schools, is 
a native of Geneva, N. Y. He ob
tained his early education at that 
place, later going to Yale University, 
Where he graduated in 1896. He be
came a member of the executive staff 
of the schools in 1904, with title of 
Assistant Secretary, and was ad
vanced to his present post in 1906. 
It is not in keeping with Tartans 
policy, which is to give the students 
something new, to say more of him; 
for can there be anybody who doesnt 
know Billy? However, for the ben
efit of posterity we continue of him, who 
even now has come to be one of Techs 
most cherished landmarks, and the 
most likely personage to approach at 
all times, and for all information on 
all subjects from the price of baled 
hay to the latest faculty ruling. His 
sanctum is the first to the right of 
the main entrance, in the line of ex
ecutive offices, and a perfect cinch 
it is to get in. Buta job to stay 
in, for if your business be not to the 
point he will grasp your hand in a
most cordial and familiar manner and 
lead you to the door; you fail to re
alize you have been bitten until you 
reach the cold, outer corridor. He is 
a veritable thorn in the side of the 
Pittsburg business man, for when he 
isnt asking for the free use of the 
Music Hall for the Glee Club he is 
asking the mayor to fix up the oval 
for the foot-ball team. Some one has 
said that he could talk the watch out 
of a mans pocket for Techwe add 
that we believe he could get his over
coat, too.
Mr. Fields popularity with the stu
dents varies like a sine curve, at its 
maximum, after he has rendered them 
a valued service, at its minimum after 
his stout refusal to permit them the 
use of the official Tartan banner, or 
the like. He rides the crest of the 
wave or reposes in its trough, how
ever, with equal sangfroid, continuing 
to grind out his ideas whether they 
find student favor or not, although if 
you can button-hole him for a mo
ment you will find he has abundant 
reason for his every course of action.
Many rumors are afloat of the many 
brilliant social successes of Mr. Field, 
but it is our desire to throw the cloak 
of society news around one who will 
come later in the shape of Professor 
Hokanson, so here we let Billy rest.

Mr. Edison on Technical Education.
An article appearing in the January 
number of Success on Thomas A. 
Edison contains the following state
ments:
Mr. Edison, however, takes a deep 
interest in young men and offers 
them much encouragement. "To-day 
is youths zenith in this great coun
try,  is the way he cheers them on.
The United States is starving for 
ten-thousand-dollar men. Corporaporations are actually clamoring for 
them; and the younger, the better. 
But the man to-day must be technic
ally educated. Modern industrial, 
financial and commercial conditions 
are more complicated than ever be
fore, and it takes a trained mind and 
a level head to get to the front.
In the technical world we could 
stand a dozen more institutions like 
the Massachusetts Institute of Tech
nology. Great concerns such as the 
United States Steel Corporation
gather up the graduates as fast as
they are turned out. I had my name 
on the colleges waiting list for a 
time and so it goes.
The demand for educated men, 
chaps that have brains, exceeds any
thing that I have ever known. They 
are doing the work, too, thats why 
more are wanted. So now is the 
time for the man who is going to 
make something of himself to get 
busy. If he is any good he wont be 
out of a job long; not much. There 
is entirely too much work, and too 
few of the right kind of persons to 
do it.
If you dont believe it, take a peep 
into the gigantic plant of a concern 
like the Bethlehem Steel Company. 
Yes, sir, we are starving for brains 
or ten-thousand-dollar men, if that 
way of putting it appeals more strong
ly to the American instinct.
This is what the most famous in
ventor of the day thinks about tech
nical education, and we think that the 
foregoing statements will hold Mr. 
Crane for a while.-----o-----

Testing Rails, Not Locomotives.
Reports which have recently ap
peared concerning certain tests the 
Pennsylvania Railroad has been 
making on the West Jersey and Sea
shore Railroad near Clayton, N. J., 
have created an entirely erroneous 
impression. It has been stated that 
the company was racing steam and 
electric locomotives, with *a view to 
determining the speed capacity of 
each type. The Pennsylvania Rail
road has other, more accurate and 
much less dangerous methods of test
ing the speed of locomotives than 
trying them out in such a manner as 
this.
Furthermore, the types of electric 
and steam locomotives which have 
been used in these experiments were 
not designed primarily for speed, and 
any inference based on their perform
ance in this regard would be incor
rect. What the company is doing is 
this: Experience indicates that the
operation of electric locomotives, ow
ing to their lower centre of gravity, 
has an effect upon the track entirely 
different from that due to the action 
of steam engines. In order to ascer
tain the exact nature and extent of 
this pressure upon the rails, the mo
tive power department has devised 
the apparatus which is being utilized 
at Clayton.
A stretch of track about 166 feet in 
length has been equipped with rails 
and cast-steel ties, designed and 
made especially for this purpose. In
stead of attaching the rail to the ties 
by spikes, a special form of block has 
been substituted, which allows a 
slight movement of the rails as the 
engine goes over it; this movement 
registers the force with which the 
flanges of the wheels strike or press 
against the rails. It is expected that 
a large number of experiments with 
this apparatus will show the company 
quite accurately what the effect is 
of either steam or electric locomo
tives, moving at different speeds over 
either straight or curved track.
Necessarily, to make these tests the 
engines must move at different speeds, 
and at all times each attains its 
maximum speed.
An electric apparatus has been de
vised to measure the precise amount 
of time elapsing while the different 
locomotives pass over this 166 feet 
of track, in order that in computing 
the effect upon the track the exact 
speed attained may be known. The 
steam and electric locomotives, how
ever, go over the track at different 
times, and there is no element of con
test as to speed between the two 
types. The matter of speed is purely 
incidental to the main purpose of the 
tests, which is to enable the com
pany, in planning its electric installa
tions in New York, to design a track 
so safe as to be absolutely secure 
against any form of locomotive that 
may be utilized.Cossiers Magazine.

Patenting a Hole.
The queerest patent? said the at
torney. Well, the queerest patent I 
know of was the patent of a hole. An 
old farmer out St. Louis way patent
ed a hole, and, what is more, he made 
a lot of money on it. Now, though, 
it isnt worth the paper it is written 
on. The farmer, one morning in the 
dim past went to wind his big silver 
watch and found the key stuck full 
of dirt. He tried to dig the dirt out 
with a pin. No go.
 Gonsarn ye, he said, Ill fix ye.
And he drilled a hole in the key 
and with a single breath glew out 
every bit of the dirt. He patented 
that hole. He built a factory, bought 
millions of keys and made holes for 
them. His plant turned out 27,500 
holes a day. In fact, all the world 
used the farmers watch keys, which 
were the only kind that would keep 
clean, and the old fellow got rich.

Tech Loses to Geneva.
Last Thursday evening the fact was 
once more forcibly demonstrated that 
a Tech team unaided by good rooting 
is not as good as a Tech team backed 
by a body of Tech students. Other 
causes helped our boys on their 
downward way, chief among which 
was the very slippery condition of the

final one will be fought out at Duquesne Garden some time next month. 
Dont think for a moment, fellow stu
dents, that history will repeat 
itself in this case, because it is up 
to the students and they know it.

To read, think, speak and enjoy,

Important class meeting Wednes
day evening, January 22, 19071911, 
respond.
On last Wednesday evening at 10.30, 
the postponed regular meeting of 
the class of 1911 was held in the as
sembly room. Owing to the illness 
of Mr. Cline, the secretary, Jesse J. 
Oren was appointed secretary pro 
tern. There was a great amount of 
accumulated business, which was dis
posed *t>f in a remarkably short time. 
The usual attendance was at the 
meeting and the usual faces. The 
loyalty to 'the class is certainly at a 
low ebb when thirteen out of a pos
sible ninety is all that can be mus
tered. Notwithstanding the small at
tendance the matter of the annual 
banquet was yoted on and referred 
to the social committee for arrange
ment. The committee was given full 
powrer to make all such preparations 
as would insure a repetition of last 
years successful venture.
The motion which gave the commit
tee their instructions made the ex
press stipulation that the cost be not 
more than $2.50 per plate and as 
much less as could be and sitill re
main consistent with a good menu 
and service.
Other matters were taken up such 
as extending a vote of thanks to all 
who assisted in bringing the smoker 
to a successful issue.
There were some matters left for 
further consideration at a meeting 
to be held this evening (Wednesday, 
January 22, 1908). As the matters 
held over are of more than ordinary 
moment, a large attendance is desired.
Some of the members of the Man
dolin Club are sporting badges stolen 
from the girls at the recent recep
tion. They all were ungallant 
enough to criticise their trophies, 
making the suggestion that Mu Chi 
Sigma would rather be (Mu) Chi Sig
ma.
C. B. Cline (Cow Boy Cline) is 
again with us after a short illness. 
Welcome back again, pard!
That sanctimonious chap is Hess. 
There is nothing wrong with him 
he just reformed.
On the 18th of September, 1907, 
two men appeared at the office of a 
well-known firm, with straw hats 
adorning their crowns. As everybody 
knows the time limit for straw hats 
had expired, so a self-appointed vig
ilance committee took the offensive 
lids and allowed the owners to go 
home hatless. When the heavy snow 
of the other day fell the owners of 
the straw hats were pleased to find 
their summer headgear restored, but 
the laugh was of short duration, as 
their derbies had been removed by 
the same mysterious agency and they 
were left to go home in the snow 
with their fur gloves, heavy overcoats, 
over shoes, ear muffs andstraw 
hats.
The foregoing was told by a 1911 
student as an actual occurrence at the 
office at which he worked.

The Mandolin Club furnished the 
music at the reception given by the 
second year girls to the first year 
girls of the M. M. C. S. on January 
14.
The reception was for the giiis 
only, but the manner in which they 
received the boys made a very en
joyable time for all.
This is the second time the club 
has played for the girls reception, 
and it is safe to predict that on fu
ture occasions the music will come 
from the same source.
The boys extended their thanks to
1908 for the invitation, which by the 
way, came near being received too 
late, due to Taxis, the President of 
the Club, not looking in the right 
box for his mail, at the office.
The combined musical clubs will 
give an entertainment in Knoxville 
on January 30.
Some excuse is due the class for 
the absence of class news in the last 
two issues of The Tartan. Illness, 
combined with a rush of work, is the 
one offered by the editor of 1910 
column, and in view of the fact that 
the majority of the items are gath
ered by him, it is hoped the excuse 
will be accepted.
Lautenschlaeger has not been in 
attendance at any sessions since the 
middle of December, can any one 
inform us of the reasons?
Any information as to the condition 
of President Smith, who is ill, will be 
gladly received.
Sections C and D have finished 
trigonometry and are starting solid 
geometry; they bid fair to catch Sec
tions A and B before the end of 
the term.
Rumors are current that sessions 
held on Tuesday nights will be held 
hereafter on Wednesday nights; this
will make it hard for some of the 
boys, as plans were made long ago 
for certain permanent engagements 
on this night. The fussers are al
ready kicking.
When Taxis offered the necessity 
of his playing with the Mandolin Club 
at the girls reception as an excuse 
lor non-attendance on Tuesday even
ing, Mr. Bassett said, that is tough! 
Did he mean on the girls?
The Banquet Committee, composed 
of Messrs. Burgess, Grote, Frank, 
Swartz and Taxis, held a meeting on 
Friday evening and started the work 
of preparation for the annual good 
time.
Kenton has been transferred from 
Section C to Section A. His part
ners in the Physic Lab. will miss his 
accurate work and willing manner.
A gocd description of the largest 
machine tool ever manufactured, is 
published in the January number of 
Machinery. It is a planer built for 
the Mclntosh-Hemphill Company, of 
Pittsburg, by the Niles-Bennett-Pond 
Company in Philadelphia. The arti
cle is a very interesting one and some 
idea of the size of the planer can be 
had when its weight is said to be 
407% tons and requires for its oper
ation five electric motors aggregating 
207 horse power.
Any student desiring to secure a 
copy of Goodmans Mechanics as ap
plied to Engineering, hand his name 
to J. H. Taxis, Class 1910, Night 
Electricals. A club is being formed 
to secure a price of $2.00 per book. 
The regular price is $2.50. This is 
an excellent work on Mechanics, and 
is useful to both the Mechanical and 
Civil Engineer.
The Phi Beta Psi Fraternity was 
organized on January 13, 1908, by the 
following third year night students in 
School of Applied Science: John W.
Considine, Lewis C. Frank, John L. 
Keehan, Edward M. George, David 
V. Newcomer, J. Hamilton Taxis, Al

3 PLEBES. $
Lowell W. Nicols, Editor.
Since one article devoted to class 
spirit has already appeared in this 
column, it would ordinarily be sup
posed that no more of a like nature 
would be necessary. At that time 
nothing in particular had occurred 
that brought the lack of it into view, 
but rather a number of things, all 
small in themselves. No adverse 
comment on the article reached the 
writers ears, so it was supposed it 
had voiced the sentiment of the class. 
Events of last week, however, make 
this improbable. A meeting was 
called, and announced in the lecture 
hall when the whole class was pres
ent, but only one-fifth appeared at the 
class meeting. Parties searched the 
halls and shops in hopes of finding 
that some of the sections had been 
detained. Fifteen minutes after the 
time set, the meeting was called to 
order with about one-fourth present. 
Fine showing, wasnt it? Nice class 
spirit or class loyalty or whatever 
you want to call it. Splendid way of 
showing your interest in things, and 
the very ones that stay away are 
always those who come whining 
around when anything is going on, 
and want to know why they are not 
represented. As for applying proper 
adjectives for an adequate expression 
of our opinion of such persons, prin
ters rules make that impossible. 
Nothing would give me more pleasure 
than to have the privilege of giving 
the aforesaid description in person to 
those to whom it applies.
Evidently something is wrong; 
something must be wrong, or nothing 
of the sort could have happened. It 
seems as though some of the class 
have the idea that the only way to get 
along in the school is to conduct 
themselves as though they were em
ployed in a soulless corporation 
where everyone must look out for his 
own interests regardless of anyone 
else; where there is no common in
terest, no bond of sympathy, no homo
geneity of purpose, and the idea that 
society in general owes them a living. 
Let us hope that any individuals 
among us, so grossly misguided, will
be enabled to renew their faith in 
human nature, and realize that here 
at least, men are not ready to spring 
at each others throats. We are all 
working for the same end, and to get 
there, we will have to work together.
We come how, to the dont give a 
hang crowd. You find them in al
most any school, and worst of all, 
their ailment seems to be an incura
ble one. Temporary relief can be 
afforded by applying water in large 
doses, after which the patient should 
be placed near the boilers to dry.
The mid-winter sports (not mem
bers of the class) are at last receiv
ing some attention. Barrett was 
elected manager of the basket-ball 
team, and Red Hatcher, manager 
of the hockey team. It is desired 
that every one playing either game 
hand his name in at once.
