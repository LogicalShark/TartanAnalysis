YISBAD LWMP
Playing at the Field House on 
Thursday night, February 19, the var
sity had little trouble in beating Grove 
City by the one-sided score of 48 to 
19. The home players put up a giltedged brand of basketball through the 
entire game. Their shooting, passing 
and guarding were the best ever put up 
on the home floor by any team, and 
the work of the five as a unit was as 
nearly perfect as possible.
The game started with the teams ap
parently well-matched, but the Car
negie boys soon showed that they had 
their opponents hopelessly outclassed. 
From the toss-up, the ball went toward 
Grove City goal, but was taken from 
the visitors and rushed up the floor. 
Tumpane blew a shot and Colvin 
was likewise unsuccessful. Then the 
visitors ran the ball under their basket, 
and Black shot the first goal of the 
game. A foul was called on Grove 
City and Colvin made good. Harper 
missed a foul and Criswell made a long 
shot that sent the ball through the net. 
Criswell and Hines made the score 7 
to 2, then Harper caged a foul goal. 
The Carnegie boys steadily increased 
the lead and but one more field goal 
was shot by Grove City in the half. 
The period ended 31 to 10.
In the second half, the home team 
started out just as they had been play
ing when time was ended and seven 
points were added before Grove City 
scored on a foul. Colvin was replaced 
about the middle of the period by 
Levy. Grove City scored from the 
field three times in the half, while Car
negie tallied five field goals.
The real feature of the game was 
the perfect team-work and confidence 
in each other that the men showed. 
There were no individual stars,the 
entire constellation was exceeding 
bright. Criswell led the scoring, and 
did the best shooting. Colvin starred 
from the foul line, caging 11 out of
12 shots. Tumpane played his usual 
fast game, and the guards, Hines and 
Douthett, played as star guards should 
play. Thorn and Black did good work 
for Grove City.

Substitutions: Levy for Colvin, HazWith a small number of men en
tered in the Y. M. C. A. meet last 
Saturday, Tech made a very creditable 
showing. Dunseith captured the only 
first place by winning the quarter mile 
handicap race. He ran well and fin
ished ahead of competitors who had 
larger handicaps than he, Haselton, 
our star distance runner, furnished one 
of the sensations of the meet. Al
though he finished fourth he practical
ly won the race. Running from scratch 
against his old rival, Organ, of the 
Buhl Club, who defeated him in the 
cross-country meet at Crafton, Hasel
ton drew away from him in the last 
eighth of a mile and sprinted to the 
tape fifty yards ahead. But he was 
unable to overtake the first three men 
whose handicap varying from 60 to 80 
yards, he cut down to 15 at the finish. 
His time of 10 minutes and 6 seconds 
for the two miles was better than any 
record he made last season outdoors. 
King experienced a little hard luck and 
lost out to his ex-team mate, Harry 
Murphy, who is now jumping for P. 
A. A. Murphy clearing the bar at the 
height of 5 feet 11 inches on his second 
attempt. King missed his second 
chance and on the final trial, the 
spikes in his shoe broke as he started 
to jump and prevented him from get
ting his proper take off. In the 60- 
yard dash Hennman, a Plebe in the In
dustry School, finished third. Consid
ering the class of the field his show
ing was excellent. Rauh reached the 
semi-finals of this event by winning his 
heat but was unable to qualify for the 
finals. One of the men on whom Coach 
Dull had counted for the relay team 
could not compete and at the last min
ute the Tech entry was withdrawn. 
Pitt had little trouble in this race, 
taking it in exceptionally good time of 
3 minutes and 39 seconds.
The special attraction of the evening 
furnished a real thriller. Led by Capt. 
Brown as anchor man, Yale won from 
Princeton by a scant yard. Brown 
started on the last half mile a little 
behind McKenzie, the Princeton cap
tain, and gave a beautiful exhibition 
of running with his head. He dis
played the true, bull-dog spirit at the
finished when he dashed into the crowd 
and collapsed in the arms of one of the 
spectators.

The Prom is a thing of the past now 
so the idea is to plan for the Home 
Concert and dance March 13th.
The third game in a row put the 
varsity against Pitt Saturday night, 
February 21, and brought them out 
losers by the score of 42 to 27. The 
real game was played in the first half, 
which ended 16 to 15 in favor of Pitt. 
In the second half our players went 
stale and were out-distanced. Had
they been fresh and untired by two
hard games of the two previous nights, 
the story would undoubtedly have 
been different, for at the end of the 
first period they were beginning to 
find themselves and had Pitt on the 
run. The hard pace told on their
fagged muscles, and, although they
never gave up fighting, the home team 
drew away in the latter part of the 
second half.
Lubic started the scoring from the 
foul line, caging two shots before Col
vin was given a chance. Both teams 
ran the score on fouls until it was 
tied at four each. Criswell mdae the 
first field goal, making it 6 to 5. Lubic 
tallied a field goal and a foul while 
Hines tied the score at eight with a 
basket. Pitt took a lead of a point 
and held it until Colvin tied the score 
at 15 with a foul. Just before the 
end of the half, Lubic shot a foul goal 
an dthe period ended 16 to 15.
In the second half, Colvin shot a 
foul, tying the tally at 16, but Pitt 
started to take a lead and could not 
be headed. Davis refereeing gave 
Lubic an excellent opportunity of 
showing his skill at shooting fouls, 
but Colvin, with fewer opportunities, 
did almost as well.
Hines did the best work for Car
negie. His guarding was of the high
est type and he showed the effects 
of fatigue less than his team-mates. 
Criswell also showed up well, but the 
pace of three nights was too much and 
his injured knee forced him out of 
the game. Levy took his place, but, 
although fresh and fast, he played 
without using his head and was with
drawn for Henning. Colvin played 
creditably in the first half, as did the 
entire team, but was all in at the end 
of time. The lineup:

THE y9Uite y,,41eyve4t.
During the past few years we have 
witnessed here the remarkable growth 
of a body of men whose common am
bition is for a better Carnegie Institute 
of Technology. The first classes were 
graduated from this school in 1908, yet 
in the short space of six years the 
graduates of the Schools of Applied 
Science and Design have attained a 
position where they may well hope to 
influence for good the undergraduates 
in their relations to the institution and 
among themselves.
The organization of an efficient 
Alumni Association was never a matter 
of a few moments thought, nor was it 
accomplished by the efforts of one 
man alone. It was necessary for all 
the Alumni to strive together, to over
come unforeseen obstacles, to face dis
couragements one after another, and 
yet to progress undauntedly. There 
are a few men who stand out promi
nently in this struggle, among them 
the present President of the Associa
tion. Leaders there had to be, else 
nothing would have been accom
plished; but the energy of these lead
ers was supplied and sustained by the
enthusiasm of the other Alumni.
We can scarcely realize yetour 
school is so youngwhat an Alumni 
Association means to our institution; 
but let us look at older schools in this 
country,Harvard, Yale, Columbia, 
Michigan, Princeton. In these schools 
we see the Alumni taking a most active 
interest in all student affairs, and 
showing an anxious desire to contrib
ute to the welfare of the undergradu
ate body. Much of the famous Yale 
spirit is without doubt due to the 
Alumni Association, and its support of 
athletics. The ideals of democracy 
have also been fostered by this As
sociation, and today the most cher
ished asset of the institution is its 
reputation for a democratic spirit. On 
the 23rd of this month, Yale held its 
first Alumni University Day for the 
purpose of an informal study of edu
cational conditions and problems at the 
University. Educational problems 
were discussed in conferences between 
graduates, undergraduates, and mem
bers of the Faculty, and the new 
equipment of the University was thor
oughly inspected by the Alumni. At 
Harvard it has become a custom for 
the Chief Marshals class to subscribe 
$100,000 on Commencement Day, and 
gifts to the institution are continually 
pouring in from' other alumni.
Columbia has for five years held 
successfully an Alumni Day, at which 
time class rooms and laboratories are 
open to all who wish to examine the 
present teaching conditions there or to 
discuss problems and to reminisce 
with the professors and to meet the 
students. The Alumni of Columbia 
also have a representative on the 
Board of Trustees and effect an un
measured influence on the policy of 
the institution.
Surely there can be nothing better 
for an institution than this well-mean
ing interest of those who have gradu
ated from it in past years. We are 
glad to note the efforts of our Alumni 
Association to attain recognition, for 
we know that only good can come from 
its activity for our institution. Its 
growth in the last few years has been 
phenomenal; let it continue in the 
same way for ten more years, and our 
Alumni will have made for our insti
tution an unsurpassed reputation in 
all lines of university attainment.

The Junior Prom was without doubt 
one of the most successful affairs of 
its kind that we have had at Carnegie. 
The booths were tastefully decorated, 
the music was good, there was very 
little really sensational dancing, and all 
present enjoyed themselves. Congrat
ulations to the Committee, and espe
cially to the Chairman!
We say this by way of introduc
tion, lest the following remarks may 
be construed possibly as a reflection 
on this years Prom. Now let us look 
at the matter of a Junior Prom from 
another standpoint.
Last year only 47 per cent of the 
Science Juniors attended, and the rep
resentation from the Design School 
was still smaller. This year, we are 
informed by the Chairman, there was
not even so large a percentage as last 
years. What does this signify-? Why 
is it that more Juniors do not attend? 
We do not believe it is because of lack 
of interest, nor that it is because of 
a disinclination towards dancing. The 
real reason must be that the expense 
of the affair prevents many from go
ing. When the proportion of the class 
not present becomes more than half, 
it seems that the matter is worthy of 
some consideration. Since half of the 
class cannot afford to attend this func
tion, we lay ourselves open to the 
charge that the Prom is only for a 
minor aristocracy in the class, and 
this charge is by no means pleasing. 
Is there a remedy? It seems impos
sible to make the Prom more inex
pensive, under the present system, but 
perhaps a simpler, less elaborate af
fair could be attended by a larger 
proportion of the class.
It is not only at Carnegie that this 
problem presents itself. In many 
schools the Prom becomes more and 
more elaborate year after year. For 
example, at Lafayette this year they 
tried an entirely new decorative 
scheme, which they were proud to an
nounce as new and original, requiring 
a solid new ceiling, specially decorated 
and illuminated. The programs were 
claimed to be the most elaborate 
ever used. At Michigan there will 
be no Junior Hop this year, the reso
lution of the University Senate show
ing its appreciation of the efforts of 
the committee from the class of 1914, 
but stating that it deems it inad
visable to attempt to resume the 
Junior Hop. The Hop was abolished 
by the Senate of Michigan in 1913, 
after it had been a function for forty 
years. The reasons given werfe that 
the Hop had become unmanageable, 
and had outgrown entirely the sim
plicity desirable for a University func
tion, also that it was undemocratic.
Now let us look the situation square
ly in the face. We do not wish to 
lay any charge of extravagance against 
the committees of the past years, in 
fact they have made every effort to 
keep down expenses and to simplify 
the arrangements. But the fact re
mains that attendance is by a minority 
of the Junior class. If over 50 per 
cent of the class cannot attend, then 
the Prom becomes undemocratic and 
a social luxury, the realization of which 
is possible to only a smaller part of 
the student body. Unless the majority 
of the students can attend without 
undue hardship, there is no place in 
our school for a function of this kind.
This is a difficult problem. We be
lieve that the solution may be found 
in a simpler and more inexpensive 
form of Junior class function; but if 
there can be no solution we must real
ize that the Prom is not a necessity 
in an institution of this nature.

Once more all past records have 
been broken. The smashing began 
Friday night, February 20, and lasted 
until Saturday morning.
Things were a little slow in getting 
started but after the painful operation 
of marching around the room had been 
accomplished there wras nothing to it.
The music was furnished by Nirella 
and it was of such a character that no 
one could sit out a dance. During the 
first few dances there were a few hardy 
souls who tried the two-step and waltz 
but soon gave them up for the tango 
and hesitation. A chance was also 
given to everyone to make himself 
famous by dancing for the moving pic
ture man. This question is in order, 
When can we see the movies?
Time for supper was taken out after 
the fifteenth dance, after which the 
dancing was continued until 4 A. M., 
when everybody went home tired but 
happy.

Tired by a long, cold ride, the var
sity went down to defeat at the hands 
of Allegheny last Friday night, Febru
ary 20, by a score of 70 to 12. The 
players evidently showed the effects 
of the game of the night before and 
also of the journey from Pittsburgh 
to Meadville, for they put up a listless 
resistance to the fierce attack of the 
home team. The Plaid players lacked 
everything that they had had on 
Thursday night and suffered at the 
hands of a good team.
Not a field goal was scored in the 
first half, and Criswell and Douthett 
were the only ones to score from the 
field in the second period.
The game, if one-sided, was clean 
and fast, only fourteen fouls being 
called in the entire time. Park was 
the heavy scorer, getting ten field 
goals. All three of the substitutes 
taken with the team' were used.

A birthday is a big event with a store just the same as 
with an individual. Our way of celebrating these anni
versaries for the last few years have been with great sales 
in which every department of the store participates to the 
fullest of its power.
4ur ytteVan,ynY ,y9a, each 
year, is the biggest event on the store's 
calendar. .or these sales the big manu
facturers who supply our regular stocks furnish us with large quantities of their 
most attractive merchandise at complimentary price concessions. vhe eco
nomies of these sales are truly remark
able, and the best feature of all is the 
entire seasonableness and desireableness of everything.
This years well-prepared sale will be no exception, and 
with a progressive store like this it is certain to be a 
BETTER SALE than any of its famous predecessors.

Last Wednesday morning Prof. 
Miller gave a very interesting as well 
as a beneficial lecture to the students 
of the Industries School.
He had four reels of motion pictures 
showing how and where the ore was 
mined, the docks at both the shipping 
and receiving points and then all the 
processes through the mills until 
finally the finished article.
His pictures were first a general 
view of the U. S. Steel Corporation 
plant at Farrel, Pa., showing every
thing throughout their plant. Then he 
Showed in detail pictures of the dif
ferent processes and methods of hand
ling the ore and steel.
He took us to the Mesabi 
mine out in Minnesota and stated that 
here the ore was of a very rich nature 
being almost free from phosphorus and 
sulphur and that the supply was al
most unlimited. From there we went to 
the place where the ore was loaded into 
large lake vessels for transportation, 
being shown the enormous capacity 
and wonderful method for handling the 
ore; then again he carried us to the 
destination and showed how the ore 
was unloaded and placed in cars, the 
method used here being very won
derful as well as very efficient, 
and then later how the cars were un
loaded by a cradle which can be op
erated by one man.
He then showed them a ladle being 
filled and then pouring the metal into 
ingot molds; how the molds were 
taken off the ingots, and then the soak
ing pits where the ingots are heated 
to the proper temperature for rolling, 
also how the ingots were handled by 
the machinery in the rolling process 
and the different shapes and sizes into 
which they are rolled.
He showed their coke ovens where 
he said the process was very efficient, 
there being very little material going 
to waste. Also the tin mills which are 
among the largest in the country.
Prof. Millers lecture, all in all, was 
appreciated very much by the students. 
He made himself very agreeable by 
telling a few little stories and then 
getting the students right with him, 
where he held them throughout the 
lecture.

Last Thursday, Captain Jack Craw
ford, late Chief of Scouts, U. S. A., and 
Founder of the Boy Hero Movement, 
made a visit to the Schools, but on ac
count of it being inspection week, did 
not speak before the students. In
stead, he sent two copies of his book 
Whar The Hand O God is Seen, 
on the fly-leaves of which he dedicated 
a poem to Dr. Brashear on the one 
and to Dean Connelly on the other. 
The poems are as follows:
TO JOHN A. BRASHEAR 
(Uncle John)
If you and I had met some years ago,
If you could only have discovered 
me,
Among the stars with broncho soul 
aglow,
A big and brilliant star today Id be 
And yet the thorns and crosses I have 
felt,
While sore oppressed and oft mis
understood,
Have made me strong when neath 
the stars Ive knelt
And promised God and mother Id 
make good!
And hope eternal springing from1 my 
soul
With perfect faith combined to sat
isfy,
While strenuously I struggled for the 
goal,
Knowing that I would reach it bye 
and bye.
And now, Oh, brother mine, in you I 
see
Gods instrument, and with the noble 
Dean,
Will surely come the opportunity,
And here is Where the HAND O 
GOD IS SEEN.
And so dear Uncle John I fling your 
way.
These pansy buds, this little book of 
mine,
With love and blessing and a crude 
bouquet,
Together with a Bronchos Valen
tine.
Yourfriend,
J. W. Crawford, 
Capt. Jack
Feb. 14th, 1914.
TO MY FRIEND
DEAN CONNELLY. 
Accept with love this little book,
Of modest pansy flowers,
With echoes from the winging brook, 
And scenes from natures bowers,
It goes to you, my friend, today 
With glints of Gods sunshine,
A modest little crude bouquet,
A Bronchos Valentine.
And, brother mine, from men like you 
Whose honest clasp of hand,
Whose laughing eyes and kindly smile, 
Tell me they understand;
Is all I ask, and all I crave,
The flag of love unfurled 
Corraling mothers wayward strays, 
BOY HEROES OF THE 
WORLD.
And with this pansy thought I fling 
This crude boquet to you,
And also drink this toast, my friend, 
In Heavens sparkling brew,
Long life, success and happiness, 
Love, faith and hope ablend,
And purest joy without alloy,
Your broncho pard, and friend.

The basketball team will have a rest 
after last weeks strenuous schedule 
and will be called upon to play but one 
game the coming week, that with Mus
kingum, tomorrow night at the Field 
House. Once more the Varsity will 
be deprived of its leader, Capt. Cris
well, who was hurt again in the Pitt 
contest. He wrenched his injured 
knee so badly that it is doubtful if he 
will be able to resume playing this 
season.
Arrangements have been made by 
Manager Wright for a dance after the 
game. He has invited the members of 
the Ways and Means Committee of 
the wives of faculty of the School of 
Applied Science with their husbands, 
to act as chaperones, not because it is 
necessary to have chaperones, but by 
co-operating with the women, to show 
some appreciation for the interest 
they have manifested in the students.

my John ,. vaylor.
About twenty steamers are now en
gaged; thirteen of which are of the 
steam' whaler class, the remaining sev
en are of a distinct type built of extra 
heavy steel, with a specially designed 
bow the object being to ram and break 
down the heavy field of ice. The lat
est improvements in shipbuilding, viz., 
bilge kdels, submarine bells, wireless 
and electric light have also been add
ed. There are also more comfortable 
quarters for the ships company. These 
are known as tl^ dreadnought class 
and can easily carry 60,000 pelts. After 
the hunt these new ships are engaged 
in the fruit trade and service in the 
far north, carrying supplies for in
stance to the Hudson Bay Companys 
stations or Arctic expeditions. These 
twenty steamers could easily carry the 
combined cargoes of the five hundred 
ships of 1819.
An important change has taken place 
with the coming of these new ships. 
That is, a doctor must be provided for 
each ship. Formerly the duty of first 
aid devolved upon the Captain, and if 
the patient was in a critical condition 
the hunt would have to be abandoned, 
thereby inflicting a loss to all con
cerned.
At the solicitation of the Editor and 
others I have retrograded from the ac
tual hunt to explain various points, 
which to the uninitiated may prove in
teresting.
Ah! there goes the whistle, the haw
sers are cast off and slowly the ship 
begins to swing out from1 her berth. 
Many more are doing the same, and 
perhaps we shall have a race. The 
wharves are black with people assem
bled to see the ships away. And one 
can hear those old chanteys which only 
sailor men can give as they pull in the 
hawsers. As for instance, Hawl on 
the bowline, Kitty broke her towline, 
haul on the bowline, haul, boys, haul.
Now we are passing the narrows one 
hundred yards wide with perpendicu
lar cliffs rising to a height of 1800 feet 
on top of which is perched the famous 
Cabot tower used by Marconi in his 
first experiments in Wireless teleg
raphy.
During the wars of 1610 between 
England and France a chain was 
stretched across those narrows and 
when DIbervilles fleet made a dash 
on the city it was repulsed by the 
chain, and fire from the forts on either 
side.
Now we are through and racing 
toward Wesleyville, our final port of 
clearance. Six ships are also making 
for the same goal. We have a lead of 
about two hundred yards; the funnels 
are belching smoke and apparently the 
race is on in earnest and to make it 
short we beat them by two hours.
We remained at Wesleyville until 
the dawn of the 10th (the legal time 
being open at midnight.) Weighed 
anchor and proceeded to try our for
tune, the details of which shall be given 
in the next issue.
In order to familiarize the readers 
of The 1 artan with the diary which is 
to follow it is necessary perhaps to 
explain the different species of seal, 
which shall be referred to later on. 
First, the square flipper which is the 
largest of the seal species and would 
weigh, when fully matured about two 
thousand pounds; color, a dark grey, 
very shapely and closely resembles the 
walrus excepting the tusks. Very few 
of these ?re taken. The pelt with fat 
attached weighs approximately 500 
lbs., the fat being about two inches 
thick. Second, the harp seal, socailed from the representation of a 
harp in black on a light grey ground, 
on the back of the seal. This is the 
species that is eagerly sought after. 
The young, of which there are usually 
two at a birth, are called whitecoats 
from the beautiful whiteness of the 
pelt, the only black spots being the two 
eyes and tip of nose. They are fed by 
the mother and by licking newly fal
len snow. The parents fish under the 
floe for food. The parent instinct is 
marvelous in finding their young where 
sometimes tens of thousands are to
gether. As they are alike as two peas, 
the observer can find absolutely no 
difference.

Frank Kelly, the expert, who kept 
the football men, the cross-country 
runners, the basketball sharks, and 
innumerable other individuals in fight
ing trim since October, has left us 
to join his Brooklyn National base
ball club in sunny Georgia. Before 
leaving on Friday, Kelly asked that 
the Tartan publish his farewell re
marks. Inasmuch as Kelly is a Hi
bernian with a tongue that is hinged 
in the middle and the representative 
of the Tartan is not the worlds cham
pion short-hand writer, we gathered in 
full only his last remark, which was 
So long.
However, every student who has 
come into contact with Kel will un
derstand that the energetic, jolly Irish
man wished everybody and everything 
in connection with the Institute the 
best that the future can hold, and that 
he appreciated the friendship of the 
boys as much as they appreciated him.
Everyone who has been on his rub
bing table, or even has got a clean 
towel from him, has some idea of 
what it would mean to Carnegie Tech 
to have him a fixture here. As it is, 
he will be missed until the baseball 
season brings Kellys team to Forbes 
Field, and then the two-bit bleachers 
will be filled with Kellys rooters, 
pulling for him and for his team1.

With the announcement of the sign
ing of a contract to coach the 1914 
football team by Walter P Steffins, 
Chicago star and assistant coach, the 
above schedule of games for the sea
son is made public by Manager 
Rownd. Mr. Steffins signed the con
tract in Chicago last week after a per
sonal conference with Director of Ath
letics McCulloch. The director made 
the trip to the Western city to continue 
negotiations that have been in progress 
for the last two months. All difficul
ties were smoothed over, and Mr. Stefiins agreed to come to Carnegie Tech 
to teach the grid game. It is under
stood that Amherst had been after his 
services, but Carnegies advances were 
more agreeable. Coach Steffins will 
arrive soon after warm weather opens 
and will start the Spring training sea
son.
The list of games given will provide 
an excellent opportunity of trying out 
the new system of coaching that is ex
pected to be inaugurated. The sea
son will open with Waynesburg, a 
team that has always been easy for 
Carnegie Tech. The following Satur
day, October 10, will probably bring 
Geneva to Tech Field. This game is 
the only one hanging fire, but the con
test is almost assured.
Following these two comparatively 
easy games comes a real test against 
Lehigh. This will be the only game 
played outside of Pittsburgh and will 
hold the greatest interest for the stu
dents. Lehigh has been met in 1907, 
1909 and 1910, all three games being 
played here, and each time we made 
the Easterners hustle to win. Next 
year we are going after a victory, and 
the new system of play will receiy'e its 
crucial trial in this contest.
Three games with the old smaller 
rivals will be played on the home field, 
then we meet Pitt,also for the first 
time since 1910,on Forbes Fiefld. 
This game needs no comment other 
than that it will be the one that our 
team will try hardest to win.
The season closes on November 21 
with Allegheny on the home field. 
The schedule is well arranged and is 
full of interest in view of the pro
posed innovations.
The old system of using a heated 
iron and dirty cloth presses the grime

Last Friday night the musical clubs 
gave a free concert at McDonald, Pa.
Before the concert the members en
joyed a fine chicken and waffle supper 
at the Pitt Hotel, especially Manager 
Hollister, who purloined Madisons 
waffles when Duke was looking for 
the deserts on the menu.
The program was practically the 
same as that used in Warren and Erie 
and was thoroughly appreciated by a 
large and enthusiastic crowd.
While waiting for the 10:35 train 
which carried the clubs back to Pitts
burgh, a curbstone concert was started 
on the depot platform and was rudely 
interrupted by the taown constabule, 
whose lack of appreciation of the fel
lows efforts showed that his esthetic 
taste for music was very crude. In 
fact his conception had not reached the 
Found the horse shoe stage. He 
arrested the clubs collectively, separ
ately, and individually until he was 
quite at a loss to know just who he 
had arrested and who he hadnt. Al
though this arm of the law showed 
a very noted and prepossessing front, 
his grammar grated harshly on the ears 
of our Tech sons while his breath 
showed that he was a man of consider
able spirit. He said in part youns 
should a knowed that this yere town 
werent no single team vehicle. This 
personage extolled his town as a peace
ful and quiet coming community. He 
also went so far as to intimate that 
the boys were not gentlenrenmuch 
to the surprise of the club 
men. As the train pulled out the clubs 
gave him a fond farewell feeling sorry 
they had no ancient fruit handy. Be
fore leaving the clubs firmly impressed 
it on the bulls mind that he should 
have perused his Policemans Manual 
of the Law on rights of town officers 
on railroad property. They arrived 
home safely but with a lessened re
spect for the majesty of the law as 
exhibited in McDonald, Pa.
Subscriptions are at present being 
secured for copies of a new song book 
at Chicago. Five hundred copies have 
been signed up for and only a hundred 
more are needed to insure its publica
tion.
The erection of the proposed sta
dium at the University of Michigan 
was made practically certain last 
week when the plans presented by the 
engineering department were ap
proved. The structure will seat 13,000 
persons and will cost between fifty and 
sixty thousand dollars. The general 
style will be similar to the Cambridge 
stadium.
The University of Oklahoma has 
just received a valuable addition to 
its archaeological department in the 
shape of four hundred fifty relics of 
Indian pottery and weapons.
The University of Pennsylvania is 
considering compulsory vaccination 
for all students.
INDOOR BASEBALL LEAGUE 
STARTED.
The failure of one of the teams to 
put in an appearance, postponed the 
opening of the indoor baseball league 
games till Thursday, February 19th, 
when Xi Sigma Upsilon walloped Sig
ma Rho to the tune of 23-4. The 
losers played with only eight men and 
blame their defeat on that fact. They 
promise to take revenge on future 
opponents. The opposing batteries 
were Burke and Henning for Xi Sigma 
Upsilon and Urquhart and Orr for 
Sigma Rho. The following games 
are scheduled this week.
Thursday, February 26th, Beta Theta 
Epsilon vs. Science Sophomores.
Tuesday, March 3rd, Theta Xi vs. 
Xi Sigma Upsilon.
Thursday, March 5th, Sigma Rho

Musical Clubs for the past year, with

This was a complete surprise to 
Holly and he was taken off his feet

Hollister would be pleased when she 
saw the gift.
According to a report given by an

Within the Law comes to the Al
vin Theater Monday night, March 2, 
with Helen Ware in the leading role.
The story of Within the Law con
cerns the life of Mary Turner, a shop 
girl convicted and sentenced to prison 
for three years for a theft which she 
did not commit. She serves her time 
in spite of her plea of innocence. Ed
ward Gilder, owner of the store, is de
termined to make an example of some
one as a warning to the other em
ployes, and Mary pays. Upon her re
lease Mary tries to obtain honest em
ployment but is hounded from one 
place to another by the police because 
she is an ex-convict. Finally in des
peration, she tries to commit suicide 
by drowning herself. Her life is 
saved by Joe Garson, a crook, who 
takes her home. She becomes the 
leader of the band of which Joe Gar
son is a member. She has brains 
enough to know that large swindling 
deals may be negotiated successfully 
with the aid of competent lawyers. 
She hires lawyers and grows rich.
Mary has one idea in mindto re
venge herself upon Edward Gilder, the 
man who sent her to prison. After 
four years she is able to enter the 
social circle of which Richard Gilder, 
son of her former employer, is a wellknown figure. The boy falls in love 
with her and she marries him. The 
father tries, with the aid of the dis
trict attorney and the police to drive 
Mary out of New York. But she has 
money and lawyers with which to pro
tect herself.
At this point Within the Law 
switches itself to a new angle. Joe 
Garson, the crook, disobeys1 Marys 
warning to do nothing illegal, and tries 
to rob Gilders home. The thieves 
are trapped and with them Mary, who 
had gone to save her associates, is 
caught. In the raid by the police a 
stool pigeon is murdered and the 
final act of the play takes the spec
tator into police headquarters where 
an almost tragic ending is straighten
ed out by the voluntary confession of 
Garson.

Tht machinery for operating the 
gates, dams, fender chains, pumps, etc., 
will be electrically driven; the ships 
will be towed through the locks by 
powerful electric locomotives, and 
electric energy will be utilized entire
ly for the permanent machine shops, 
for the dry-dock, for the coal-handling 
plant, for wharf cranes, and for a 
number of other purposes. The locks 
and nearby- towns will be electrically 
lighted, and the relocated Panama rail
road will possibly be electrified. Two 
large power stations and many miles 
of transmission circuits will be re
quired for the generation and trans
mission of the power to more than one 
thousand electric motors which will 
be required for the operation of the 
canal. The water power is obtained 
from the Chargres River water shed; 
Gatun Lake, having an area of 165 
square miles, offering excellent stor
age facilities. A 7500-kw. hydro-elec
tric generating station, which will sup
ply the power under normal condi
tions, is being built at the spillway of 
the Gatun dam. The present steamturbine station at Miraflores, which 
has been used during the construction 
of the canal, will, however, be retained 
and held in reserve to tide over either 
shutdowns or low-water periods of 
the Gatun station, the intention being 
to tie together the two plants by a 
high-tension transmission line. Be
sides the above, hydro-electric power 
will be extensively used for lighting 
purposes along the canal, and possibly 
in connection with the fortifications 
which are being planned.Engineer

We have classified our advertisers so that our readers may use the list 
for reference before making purchases. The grouping furnishes an excellent 
variety of merchants for any article which a student, alumnus or faculty 
member would be likely to buy, and there is no valid reason of which we are 
aware that would justify anyone interested in the welfare of The Tartan in 
making purchases from any but merchants who so kindly make such a publi
cation possible. Be sure, also, to give one of the purchase stubs, which you 
will find enclosed in your Tartan every other week, to the clerk from whom 
you make the purchase. The stubs, we have found, make pleased advertisers 
and help to get new ones. May we depend upon YOU to take this as a re
sponsibility to your Institution and to The Tartan.

There is a theatrical magnate in New 
York who is up on the needs of the 
tired business man, but a little bit shy 
on general education. In his office 
they were discussing the prevalent 
hard times theatrical and otherwise.
Well, he said, theres one guy in 
this town that I envy. Hes busy all 
the time. Everywhere I go I see peo
ple using his machines.
Whos that? inquired one of the 
company.
Why, this guy Vacuum, that makes

The gymnasium has been crowded 
the past week with the contestants 
who are getting in shape for the inter
school meet on Saturday afternoon. 
Unusual interest is being shown be
cause the Design and Industry Schools 
appear stronger than ever and each 
is predicting victory over the Science 
School, the four-time winner of the 
spring meets.
The Industry School with Dunseith 
and Hennman are strongest in the 
sprints; the Design School with Haselton will be ably represented in the long 
distance races; while the Science 
School with King and Wright should 
make its best showing in the field 
events. The appeal to novices should 
be especially attractive in view of the 
fact that only five letter men from 
last years track team are in school. 
Those who win places are almost cer
tain of participating in at least one 
of the two indoor meets scheduled for 
next month. Captains Clair of the 
Science School, Haselton of the De
sign School, and Dunseith of the In
dustry School, have charge of all en
tries which should be in their hands 
not later than 5 oclock this afternoon. 
The events will be started promptly at 
2 oclock on Saturday at the Field 
House.
