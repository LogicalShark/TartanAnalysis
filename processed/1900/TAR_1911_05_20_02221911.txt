JUNIOR PROM
Affair at Schenley a Huge Success
The Junior Prom was held last Tuesday evening 
at the Hotel Schenley and was a grand success. 
The attendance was very - large and the appoint
ments were very nicely carried out. The ball room 
was very prettily decorated with greens and ban
ners, the booths being arranged at each end of 
the floor. Taken altogether, it was the best Junior 
Prom that has been held and the committee in charge 
deserves great credit for the way in which they 
handled the affair.
The Grand March was slow in starting, and when 
the line was formed a flash was taken. After the 
Grand March was finished the regular program 
dances were started. Owing to the generosity of 
the orchestra in granting encores the Dinner Dance
did not come until shortly after twelve. The supper 
was served in the main dining room, which was 
given over entire to guests at the Prom.
In order to finish on scheduled time the orchestra 
was given orders to grant only one encore when the 
dancing started again. Accordingly the program 
was finished about 3 oclock, as had been planned.
One of the features of the evening was the moon, 
which was a huge picture of Mr. Carnegie set upon 
a Tartan background. When it was lighted up from 
behind it made a very effective moon indeed and, 
needless to add, was very popular with the dancers.
The Tartan regrets that the time of going to press 
made it impossible to run the picture of this very 
enjoyable affair.

4THE TARTAN
DR. SPARKS, PRESIDENT OF STATE COLLEGE, 
DELIVERS FINE ADDRESS.
Abraham Lincoln His Subject in the Second of 
the Science Lecture Course.
Last Thursday morning Dr. Sparks, President of 
Pennsylvania State College, delivered the second 
lecture in the Science Lecture Course. Dr. Sparks 
was introduced by Director Hamerschlag and ten
dered a welcome at Tech.
The address was so able, so instructive and so. 
interesting that we have decided to print it as nearly 
in full as possible in order that those who were not 
fortunate enough to hear it may have the pleasure 
of reading it. Dr. Sparks address was as follows: 
Gentlemen and Fellow Students: 
It is a pleasure and at the same time an embar
rassment to address a school or college audience; 
a speaker csn say anything to the ordinary audience, 
but to a schoolthey are from Missouri. How
ever, I want to say something along a serious line.
We have just passed the celebration of the birth
day of one great American and are just approaching 
the birthday of another. Both of these men repre
sent the highest ideals of our country, and it is of 
the utmost importance that we keep high ideals 
properly before our nation. A nation that loses its 
traditions and legends must soon degenerate.
George Washington and Abraham Lincoln were 
types of the noblest manhood. Lincoln especially 
was a wonderful type, because of his capacity for 
self-betterment. In his youth he had nothing but 
a most ungrammatical language; he was scarcely 
ever in a grammar school, yet by his own efforts he 
trained himself to write excellent English. He 
was born on southern soil, in Kentucky, and loved 
the South. How can we measure this man? What 
made him the man he was? Some one said to me 
the other day that Abraham Lincoln was a miracle. 
We are told that a miracle is God working in a mys
terious way that surpasses human intelligence. I 
do not believe that Lincoln was a miracle. He was 
a man of high ideals, a genius of rare ability and 
resolute character and purpose. The point we are 
trying to make is for each one to bring himself up 
to a high ideal.
There are two great laws known by which we 
study men. One is the law of heredity. A farmer 
knows too much about this law and the laws of Na
ture to plant a pumpkin vine near a melon vine. 
The stock breeder takes advantage of the law of 
heredity. Heredity is a well-known law which we 
use for every species which we wish to improve 
except the human race, and I would add that we 
should do very little toward improving the human 
race until we apply the law of heredity. When 
Theodore Roosevelt was President, he was con
cerned with the size of families, apparently regard
less. of this law. I am more concerned with the 
quality of families. Almost daily we read, or hear
men speak of their ancestors, their noble birth, and 
the relationships they have inherited. We are all 
proud of our family trees. Many of us have family 
trees hanging on our walls; if not, we can go to the 
library and buy one. In Lincolns time it did not 
make much difference who your grandfather was, 
but the thing of importance was what he could do. 
Now I am obliged to leave that law.
The other law is the law of environment. I claim 
that this law is stronger than the law of heredity. 
If it is not, we should close this School and all other 
schools. We believe that by environment all edu
cation can raise each succeeding generation higher 
than the preceding generation. That is the whole 
hope of environment in education. Lincolns en
vironment consisted not of the college or university, 
but of the frontier, by which we mean the great 
plains, the rough country, where the civilization is 
now the same as in the East.
One cf the first things that the frontier taught a 
man was investigation. You are investigating in 
your laboratories, but in our every-day life we do 
not investigate enough. I have read somewhere of 
a man who went to Harvard and took a class under 
Agassiz. He put down a bottle in which was a fish 
preserved in alcohol, and instructed the young 
men to look at the fish until he returned. They 
looked at the fish from all sides. The professor 
came back and asked what they had seen. The 
young men gave their reports, describing the fins, 
tail, scales, head, etc., but Agassiz was not satisfied. 
He told them to look at it again, until he came back. 
Then a young man observed that if you turn 
the fish up on the edge it shows the fish to be the 
same on one side as on the other side, and this was 
the report he gave. That is the point, said the 
great naturalist, the bilateral organization organ
ization of the fish. That was the lesson for today; 
you are excused. Teaching, you see, by observation. 
We are in too big a hurry now to teach by observa
tion. We must examine twenty fish instead of one 
fish in the same length of time.
Lincoln was out on the frontier in a school where 
they had to investigate. He had no text books, was 
never in a laboratory, did not know anything about 
a test tube, and possibly nothing about a microscope. 
He had to investigate, and do most of his studying 
by investigation. He would dismount from his horse 
and examine any unusual tree or object his keen 
eyes might observe. If his son was given a me
chanical toy Lincoln would want to take it to pieces 
and see how it was constructed inside. When he 
came back from Congress the first time he came 
with a number of other congressmen by way of Ni
agara Falls, crossing the lakes on steamboats. He 
wc:s constantly down in the engine-room examining 
the machinery. Although Lincoln had never taken 
a course in mechanical construction, he wrote a 
book on engines, and soon after took out a patent 
applicable to a need in the West where he had 
studied such things. As there were no railroads the

---------------------------------------------------

THE TARTAN
people had to use the rivers out there, and often the 
boats and rafts could not cross the sand bars in low 
water or even in ordinary times. Lincoln had the 
idea of taking buoys and putting them under the 
vessel and inflating them so as to buoy them up suf
ficiently to pass over the sand bar. Although he 
never sold any of these things, the incident shows 
that he had the idea of investigation and invention, 
rte had a great many new problems to meet when 
he was President. He had investigated the move
ments of armies and navies, of treasuries and every
thing of vital importance to the nation, and was thus 
made the man for the hour when the need came to 
save the Union.
Lincoln conceived the idea of sending a flat-boat 
lead of flour down to St. Louis. As he guided the 
boat along he had no chart nor compass, and this 
river had never been surveyed. He had to meet 
every snag and stump and obstacle just as he came 
to it. So when he took hold of the helm of the 
great Ship of State in the time of war he had to 
meet each obstacle and difficulty day after day as 
he came to it, and this required self-reliance which 
was taught him by the frontier.
The frontier taught a man to use very simple lan
guage, so that Lincoln had not much time for fancy 
or high-flown words; and it also taught him to say 
what he meant in short order or shut up. The fron
tier language was a fine type of rhetoric; we find this 
exemplified when Lincoln gave the famous Gettys
burg dedication address. The oration proper was 
given by another man who spoke for two and onehalf hours. Then Lincoln arose with his seventyfive word masterpiece. Nowadays the oration has 
been forgotten, but the dedication address has come 
to be a classic because of its simple language. 
There are only twenty-three words longer than two 
syllables in the address. All through the war Lin
coln used such simple language that everybody un
derstood him. Many times his language was the 
language of the frontier, and sometimes his Cabinet 
was displeased with its simplicity.
The frontier environment taught a man to be 
original. Lincoln is often called the first great orig
inal American. We have not much originality now. 
But few of us try to be original. We nearly all try 
to be just exactly the same.. Your collars and ties 
ara ail generally the same. If a man wears his hair 
longer, or a woman hers shorter, than they should 
we chall them a crank. Now we have a right to be 
original, just as original as Lincoln was. It would 
seem as if God has set Lincoln aside for a definite 
given purpose, and all over his countenance it seems 
as if Providence had written Originality. He is 
called the most original story teller, though he him
self tells us that many of his stories are not original. 
When he became President the times demanded an 
original man. William Henry Seward was his great 
rival for nomination, but was not original in any 
sense of the word. It was Seward who pro
posed a plan by which to try to stop the Civil War.
He advised President Lincoln to to get up a brisk 
foreign war and compel united self-protection at 
home. Lincoln knew that we had saved the Union 
again and again by that same trick, and he said,or 
is credited with saying,You can foool all the peo
ple part of the time, and part of the people all of 
the time, but you cannot fool all of the people all 
of the time.
Lincoln loved the law and loved the Constitution.
I have heard a man say that Lincoln was destined 
by God to free the slaves. It may be, but I have 
no private advice on that question. It has also been 
said that Lincoln was resolved that if he ever be
came President he would free the slaves, but that 
makes him an abolitionist, and I do not believe he 
ever made such a resolve. Lincoln was not deter
mined to stamp out slavery, but he was determined 
to observe the law and preserve the Union according 
to the Constitution of the United States. He clung 
to the idea of compensated emancipation, and Con
gress passed a low offering to buy the slaves of any 
southern State not in rebellion, as for instance Ken
tucky. Lincoln said to Mr. Seward that if they 
could get even one State to accept their offer to buy 
their slaves they would not have labored in vain.
In his inauguration Abraham Lincoln said: No 
man ever became President under the same condi
tions that I became President. He did not get onehalf of the votes that were cast. That happens 
sometimes in our system of elections. He could 
never have been elected if there had not been a split 
in the Democratic Party. Lincoln was misunder
stood by his own people. He wras too original.
* * * * * * *
In closing there are a few special thoughts that I 
wish to present to you:
FirstThe frontier taught him never to compro
mise. Nature is the teacher on the frontier, and 
Nature never compromises. If you decide to sleep 
out of doors unprotected some cold night, Nature 
will not compromise with you.
SecondDuring the war, by his originality Lincoln 
saved the North not from the Souththat they 
would be conquered was a foregone conclusion, as 
the resources of the South were limited and were 
practically exhausted, and the curse of slavery was 
bound to be stamped outbu he saved the North 
from the North,he saved the North from them
selves. War breeds blood-thirstiness and leads to 
unfairness. Lincoln did not use the war powers until 
he had exhausted the peace powers. The result was 
that he brought the North out of the North with the 
same fair ideals that they had when they went into 
the w'ar. No civil war in all history has been so 
little followed by punishment of the conquered ones. 
A southerner would say that the South suffered 
enough, but there wras no confiscation of property, no 
idea of derision, no hanging of the principal men 
engaged. The head of the rebellion was never even 
brought to trial.

---------------------------------------------------

6THE TARTAN
ThirdI believe that if Lincoln had lived we 
should have been spared that fearful period of Re
construction. * * * * At the end of ten years
the South was worse off than at the close of the 
war. In his last speech, Lincoln had entered the 
court-house, stepped out on the balcony and said: 
My friends: The news which we have just received 
(Lees surrender) bids us feel the hope that the end 
of the war is at hand. Now will come the great task 
of reconstructing the Union. There has been a great 
deal of talk about whether the States have been in 
the Union or out of the Union. They certainly have 
not been out of the Union, but they have not been 
in their proper relation in the Union, and it is your 
duty and my duty to get them back into that rela
tion just as soon as possible.
Upon the close of the address President McCorkle, 
of the Senior Class, lead a cheer for Dr. Sparks, 
which were given with a will.

very liberal offer, and it was made, as we said last 
week, in order that we could show ycu that we are 
indisA ensible to EVERY man in Tech. What have 
you done about it? Have you seen Business Mana
ger H. J. McCorkle or the representative in your 
section about the entering your name on our lists, 
or are you still reading some one elses Tartan, or,
worse, not reading any? This offer was made for 
only two weeks and so has yet only one more week 
to run. Do not delay! See a Tartan representative 
now. Help us make this paper come up to the 
ideals we have for it. Help us keep the Tartan 
abreast the rapid advancement of Tech and you do 
something not only for yourself and for us, but you 
do something for your Alma Mater.
MANY ACCEPT INVITATION OF CHOCOLATE 
COMPANY
A very interesting and instructive trip has been 
taken by a number of Tech students through the 
Pennsylvania Chocolate Companys plant on Center 
avenue.
Did you ever taste chocolate when it is hot? Well, 
it beats cold chocolate a mile and is worth the trip 
out. Two things reign supreme there, one is cleanli
ness and the other efficiency of the producing ma
chinery. This alone makes an interesting study in 
itself.
This trip is of especial interest to M. M. C. S. girls 
and Science and Design men will find that it is time 
well spent.
TWO HIGH SCHOOLS SEND CLASSES TO VISIT 
TECH
During the past week two High Schools have sent 
classes to visit Tech and inspect her buildings.. The 
first class that came was the senior class of the 
Jeanette, Penna., High School and contained about 
15 in number. Mr. Tarbell had charge of the party 
while it was on the grounds.
The second party from the Mount Washington 
High School came one evening later in the week, Mr. 
Emery conducting it through. Tech is always glad 
to have such visits and visitors.
SATYA DOVA VISITS TECH
Has Walked from Washington State Visiting Edu
cational Institutions on the Way.
Satya Dova, a Hindu student, who is traveling 
around the world on foot to aid his native land, ar
rived in Pittsburgh last week and while here visited 
Tech. He is a graduate of the Universities of 
Washington and Chicago.
Satya Dova says that he intends to devote his life 
to the building up of a technical school in his native 
city. He claims that mere book learning is a good 
thing, but that what his people need is to be taught 
how to use their hands.
The traveler goes to New York next week and will 
sail for Europe where he intends to spend a year or 
more traveling overland toward India.
The practice of holding inter-class debates has just 
been inaugurated at the University of Nebraska.

2TH 2EA2ER9
To the Editors of the Tartan:
May I offer your readers some development of 
former suggestions made in your columns, touching 
student activities and ideals?
It may naturally be assumed that the most valua
ble contribution of society the professional man may 
make is excellence of skill in his chosen work; in 
other words, professional success. For this success 
the technical school sets out to provide, specifically.
But the activities of the good citizen will not gen
erally be confined within the limits of his strictly 
professional life. He must, perforce, touch the life 
of his time and community in many affairs more or 
less unrelated to his professional work and skill. 
His total usefulness as a citizen will be measured, 
to a large degree by the enthusiasm, understanding, 
wisdom, with which he influences these affairs.
Now, the students may saymust be,regarded 
as a prospective citizen of the State and of the 
world. Already he is an active citizen in a restricted 
community life,the life of his institution. Already 
while a student he arrives at such years and ma
turity as to have committed to. him the right and the 
duty to begin the exercise of his powers and influ
ence in local and universal citizenship into which 
he is to presently step forth.
Already as a student he is busily laying the foun
dation of the most immediate form of public useful
ness by providing himself with thorough training for 
his professional work. But what of the other fields 
of usefulness into which he may or must go with the 
purpose of serving the general good? What train
ing is he providing for any of these? What knowl
edge of and skill in them is he laying up against the 
day when knowledge and skill will be demanded as 
conditions of successful service? To what extent 
does he regard himself as a future citizen of the 
world,or even of his own city? What attention 
does he begin to direct toward civic affairs or world 
affairs in the realms of science, art, politics, chari
ties? What does he begin to purpose to know of 
the ideals, attainments, failures, progress, needs of 
the race in these realms?
Is it useful for him to devote some time and en
thusiasm to such things in his student days? Would 
it be fun for him to do it,-would it net him as 
much and as lasting pleasure as anything else he 
might do on the side, to put the question in its 
most appealing form? Could he afford to? Can he 
afford not to? Can older heads afford not to en
courage and inspire him to do it?
Answers to such questions must necessarily vary 
with individual inclinations and ambitions; but on 
this much perhaps all might agree; that if college 
citizenship furnished, as side issues, such skill for 
future activity in other business of the world as it 
does for future professional activity, the effect on
the individual would be immediate and that on the 
current of public affairs very valuable and far-reaching. The youthful citizens so furnished would go 
unerringly to the front for effective leadership in 
the public service as they now do in private profes
sional work.
Would not this move the efficiency of the race 
^ upward a notch? Would it not be fun for the boys 
to move it up?
Risking undying obloquy for proposing an exami
nation, I suggest the following one, to be conducted 
by every technical student for himself:
Aside from the part of my professional work done 
in my own interest, what part of the worlds busi
ness do I care anything for, know anything of, pur
pose to lead in or help to success? Would I have a 
better chance for skillful and useful leadership if
I began on it now?
Henry K. McGoodwin.

10THE TARTAN
NEW AUTOMOBILE GAS MOTOR TESTING 
OUTFIT FOR THE MECHANICAL 
LABORATORY.
The completion and installation of the new auto
mobile gas motor testing outfit, will, no doubt, be of 
interest to those students of the School who are 
persuing engineering courses, and especially so to 
those men in the Department of Mechanical En
gineering.
The outfit was built and installed by Mechanician 
Geist, under the direction of Prof. G. C. Sproull, of 
the Department of Mechanical Engineering, and in
cludes several devices of special design, which are 
clever in that they remedy obstacles which have 
always been attendant in mechanical testing outfits 
of this character. They were built from designs 
originated by Prof. Sproull, and consequently, we 
not only have new apparatus but features which are 
probably unlike any thing else of this character in 
use elsewhere.
The source of power is a Northway 4x4, four cyl
inder, four stroke cycle gas engine. It has been 
mounted upon a cast frame bed, and placed at a 
great enough height above the floor to make all its
mechanism readily accessible and at the same time 
to save the student from that back-breaking sensa
tion which so often occurs with smaller testing ap
paratus mounted on the floor. In fact, it might be 
said here, that the aim of the department, was not 
only to build a piece of apparatus which would be 
of value in the training of the student, but also to 
make the completion of the test, as pleasant and in
teresting a task as possible.
The motor shaft has been extended through a 
flexible coupling, some eight or ten feet, and upon 
this are mounted a friction clutch pulley and a 
Prony brake. The friction clutch pulley is connected 
to the main line shaft by means of a 10-inch belt, 
and in this way the motor may be used as an aux
iliary power plant for the laboratory in the opera
tion of some of the smaller testing apparatus. The 
Prony brake is of a particularly interesting design 
in that it overcomes entirely those most prevalent 
drawbacks of the average brake of depositing its 
cooling water upon the floor when the motor is 
stopped or started, and of becoming so hot that it 
is necessary to shut down for the purpose of cooling. 
This latter defect was the result of no circulation of 
the cooling water, for, up to this time, it has been

---------------------------------------------------

THE TARTAN11
the usual plan to pour water into the brake wheel 
after starting, and to keep adding water only when 
that in the brake wheel began to evaporate. In this 
new outfit, however, the water is kept in constant 
circulation by allowing it to flow into the brake 
wheel through a small brass pipe connected to the 
city mains and to discharge through a sheet brass 
scoop which is attached to a drain pipe. The brake 
wheel has been carefully machined out on the inside, 
so that the scoop clears the wheel wall by but onesixteenth of an inch at all points, and, as a result, 
picks up the hot water and discharges it without 
the least leakage. Any possible leakage which 
occur when the brake wheel is brought to a stand
still is taken care of by means of a concave plate 
with a U cross-section at its smaller diameter, 
which is screwed securely to the open face of the 
brake wheel. This feature is sometimes found in 
large bearings to keep the oil from leaking out along 
the shaft.
Arrangements has been made to determine heat 
looses through exhaust gases, cooling water and ra
diation. Thermometers have been placed on both 
the inlet and outlet of the cooling water circuit, as 
well as a water meter for the purpose of measuring 
the quantity of water flowing. A valve has been 
inserted in the circuit, so that the amount of cool
ing water may be varied and consequently the stu
dent may vary the heat losses through this source 
at will. To the exhaust main may be attached a 
thermometer and an anemometer for determining 
the temperature and velocity respectively of the ex
haust gas. Having the exhaust pipe diameter, how
ever, the student may determine the heat losses 
losses through this medium. A valve and mano
meter are also connected to the exhaust main, and 
the effort of throttling the exhaust may be seen and 
the action of back pressures on the economy and 
power of the motor readily noted.
For the purpose of consuming the least volume 
of mixture for any load, the gas is regulated quanti
tatively by means of an especially designed gov
ernor. This will not be discussed, however, since 
some changes are to be made for the purpose of ob
taining qualitative as well as quantitative regu
lation of the fresh charge.
The ignition is of the Renny system. The stu
dent is required to do all the wiring for the oper
ation of the motor, and it will be readily seen, that 
in doing this, he is obliged to know the position of 
all four pistons, the relative succession of their fir
ing and the action of the time in advancement of 
the spark. For the purpose of regulating the latter, 
a lever has been so arranged as to move over the 
face of a divided circular scale, so that the stu
dent may determine the most economical point 
of spark advancement for all mixtures of the charge, 
as well as for all loads.
All of the forging apparatus would not be of ideal 
value unless we have some way of seeing what is 
going on within the cylinder walls as a result of the
advancement or retardation of the spark, mixture 
variation, increase and decrease of back pressures, 
etc. This is splendidly shown by the German manograph (or optical indicator.) For the benefit of 
those not familiar with this instrument, it may be 
said that it shows graphically the action within 
the cylinder in ' a manner similar to the steam 
engine indicator.
The gasoline tank has a calibrated gauge of glass, 
which enables the student to determine the amount 
of gasoline used and conseqently the heat value of 
the input work.
With all these accessories at hand the student 
may cover a very broad field which may be briefly 
summed up as follows:
a. Determination of the action of exhaust thrott
ling as concerns back pressure with their conse
quent loss in economy and power of the motor.
b. Effect of quantitative and qualitative charge 
regulation as concerns economy and power devel
oped, as well as the determination of the point at 
which the mixture is so weak that the ignition will 
not take place within the cylinder, but, rather when 
it comes in contact with overheated exhaust mains.
e. Effect of various grades of gasoline on the 
economy and power of the motor, with a view to 
determining which brings best results as regards 
cost. Various lubricating oils may be tested as an 
auxiliary experiment with an idea of studying the 
comparative wearing values. (
d. Effect of the timing of valves on the motor 
economy and power.
e. Determination of the most economical points 
of firing for all loads and mixtures of the charge. 
The length of the combustion period may also be 
compared all conditions of mixture and compression.
f. Effect of cooling wrater on economy of fuel 
consumption and motor efficiency, with a view of 
determining the best inlet and outlet temperatures.
g. Combusitons as to whether a motor running 
on 3 or less legs, looses a proportionate amount 
of power or not and whether the relative efficiencies 
decrease in a like manner or not.
Taking the field of experimental study which this 
series of tests will make possible, brings us upon 
a new field of research, for, as is evident, in con
sideration of the completeness of the 'apparatus, 
there is an extremely wide range to be covered 
and, if our time were unlimited, a very complex 
series of economy curves could be formed which, 
without doubt, would be invaluable to the auto
mobile engineer.
The Dept . of Mech. Engineering hopes at some 
future date to equip an entire automobile testing 
laboratory, and if all the apparatus is as complete 
in all details as this, it is not unfair to state that 
it bids well toward outshining anything of its char
acter in this country.
The Dept, is to be congratulated upon its large 
stride forward, and it is to be hoped that the good 
work may continue. R. C. Hanford, 11.

Now, that the first glamor of the starting of a new 
semester is over and the resolutions which always 
follow a report are all broken, the time has come for 
other things. When we think that we, who are to
day the college children of the world, have to keep 
this old ball earth still rolling and that afterward 
we have to direct its rolling, the feeling comes 
over us that the responsibility attached to it is so 
enormous that our lifetime will not be long enough 
to compass. If this thought might only penetrate 
the outer lobes of a few of the brains of our students 
so that they would give their natural bents of 
mind a chance to develop, this old world would be
come the brightest luminary in the universe. After 
we realize our vocation in life, events fall naturally 
into place. First we observe things about us, then 
we adapt them to our particular need, and lastly 
we stand back and tenderly watch them blossom 
as the rose. Where would the great men and wo
men of today and yesterday be if they had not ob
served and best of all made use of their observa
tions. The great inventions of the past centuries 
have been perfected by young people like as we 
are; the five mothers who instilled into the baby 
minds the way to go were at one time in school 
working hard at chemistry and mathematics. So 
how much more should we do than they. With a 
mighty heave ho let us gather the fragments of our 
shattered resolutions and do our part in the mak
ing of history.
Prof. Leslie J. Tompkins, president of the New 
York Association of College Graduates, says: The 
college woman has not made good. There are, I 
think, about 12,000 or 15,000 college women in the 
United States. Three-fourths of these are so nice 
that they are already married, and the remainder are 
freaks. The married woman dont take much inter

anything anyway.

THE TARTAN13
EASY FOR CARNEGIE TECH
Saturday nights game with Marietta at the Field 
House was a grand romp-away for Tech, with the full 
varsity line-up. Keltz and his stellar ability were 
right in the game and netted twenty-eight points for 
the home team, while Jordan brought home sixteen 
pretty counts.
On the first jump a foul was called on Drumm by 
the referee and Keltz started the scoring with one 
point. The pace was then set by the Tartan five and 
the Marietta buuch followed at their best, which was 
not particularly brilliant. Mulinex, who in the game 
at Marietta scored nine field goals, was able to make 
three baskets in the first half and there ended his 
score. Keltz starred in this period with four goals 
from the floor and two fouls. Jordan followed close 
with three field goals, and Saunders secured one, 
making the score in the first half, Tech 18, Marietta 9.
The vistiors started the second half with a rush 
that promised great things. When the plaid boys, 
particularly Keltz, saw that their guests were out for 
blood, a lively battle was waged. After the smoke 
had cleared, the visitors were no richer than before, 
but Keltz had scored five successive baskets in less 
than five minutes. The pace slackened slightly and 
spectators were shown some pretty team work by the 
home five. One of Jordans five goals in the second 
half was scored in a miraculous way on a long shot, 
while Keltz drew applause on a safety from an over
head throw. DuBarry was pitted against Mulinex 
and showed no mercy in his guarding. The way in 
which Saunders stayed with his man was worthy of 
the Tech guards past record. The game may be 
summed up by saying Marietta was outplayed from 
start to finish. Score:

SHORT TRIP DISASTROUS
With only two regulars in the line-up and but one 
man playing his regular position, Carnegie Tech re
ceived the worst defeat of the season at Grove City. 
Combined with the absence of the stars of the team, 
the floor was strange, the room low-ceilinged and the 
game was played under A. A. U. rules. Any one of 
these reasons might have been overcome, but the 
combination was too much for our heroes.
Another reason was Grove Citys big center, Lamb, 
who was here last fall in foot ball. Lamb, despite 
his name, is full grown and needed no step ladder to 
reach the basket. This was shown when he dropped
the ball into the cage five times in the first half, and 
ten times in the second. Himes also scored, securing 
eight baskets from the floor in the first period.
Jordan and Williams each scored a field goal in the 
initial period. Criswell came in wtih two in the last
half and Jordan made another good. The line-up:

FIRST LOSS AT HOME.
In a game that showed but a slight resemblance 
to basketball on Monday night, the Washington and 
Jefferson Collegians defeated the Tech five. A 
name has not yet been invented for the style of 
amusement furnished, but might be best described 
as a combination of football, wrestling, and a good 
healthy class rush. Both sides fouled often and in
discriminately, but no attempt at murder was made, 
though rough tactics were used. Gates starred at 
this feature of the game; his work drawing noises 
indicating disapproval from the Tech rooters who 
are noted for their toleration.
The Carnegie five showed the absence of Jordan 
and Saunders by a lack of continued team work. 
The bunch played as if dazed and came to life 
only when their goal was threatened. DuBarry 
guarded well and Kilgore showed speed when not 
held by his heavy opponents. Williams was also 
handicapped by his lightness and the illegal hold
ing of his guard. Butler received a try-out at guard 
but criticism of his playing should be withheld un
til he gets into a game of basketball.
Williams starred for the Collegians in that he 
showed more speed and ability than his teammates. 
Gates, a big freshman, would make an excellent 
football player.
The crowd present emphasized the need of more 
students at the games and the desirability of the 
attendance of at least one cheer leader.

sign attended as chaperons..
The club house was elaborately decorated with 
hearts of all sizes and stages of existence, and with 
Japanese lanterns hung from the beamed ceiling. 
One of the features of the scheme was a frieze, orna
mented by many heart-histories, in the picture 
language. Several of the guests recognized their own.
At eleven oclock a Bachelors Parade was 
formed, the ladies remaining seated while their es
corts served a buffet luncheon.
About forty couples were in attendance and this 
number included, besides the club members, students 
from Science and M. M. C. S., together with Outsiders. 
It is needless to add that everyone enjoyed the even
ing.
CRUCIBLE CLUB MEETING
The February meeting of the Crucible Club was 
held Wednesday evening, February 8th in Room 216. 
Mr. H. K. Myers, of the Mining Department was the 
speaker of the evening. His talk was on Methods 
of Mining in Mexico. Mr. Myers was well qualified 
to speak on this subject having spent a number of 
years in Mexico engaged in mining work. The prim
itive methods of mining were taken up and fully dis
cussed by the speaker. Many of his own experiences 
were touched upon during the course of the evening. 
The Mexican national drink muscal, was described 
and found a warm place in our hearts. The refresh
ments committee served a very appetizing lunch after 
which the meeting was adjourned.
The next regular meeting of the Club is scheduled 
for Wednesday evening, March 15th. The officers of 
the club are arranging to have Mr. Hursh, of the Clay 
Products division of the Arsenal Laboratory to speak 
on some phase of Ceramics.
It is urged that all members pay their dues so that 
they may be eligible to be in the picture that is to be 
taken some time this month. This is an important 
matter and should be attended to by all members as 
soon a possible,
