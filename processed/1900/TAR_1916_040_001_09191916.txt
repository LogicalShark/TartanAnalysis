The new' school year will, see 
many changes in the Faculty and 
Administration of the school 
Forty-two new appointments have

TARTAN ANNOUNCEMENTVacancy Left by Dink Merrill 
Will Re Hard to Fill.II. L. Rubin, ID, Wins Pennsylva
nia Competition Ovor U. of 
Penn.We wish to announce that this issue of The Tartan mark? 
the change in form of The Tartan from the old eight-page, fourcolumn, twelve-inch size, to the new form of four pages, sixcolumn, twenty-inch size. Our new issue contains nipety-six 
column inches more reading matter; in other words, the news 
has increased about twenty-five per cent. This is a radical 
change. By making this change we do not mean to suggest 
that The Tartan could or should have been larger in the past, 
nor that its former editors might have done more. The Tartan 
is, however, progressing with the Institution. Tech is a bigger, 
better, more mature organization today than it has ever been, 
and we are progressing in accordance with this develop
ment. In future years other editors will improve upon this issue. Our present change is, however, a stepping stone to
wards making Tech the ideal of our founder, Andrew Carnegie, 
An Institution seldom equaled, never excelled.
Tech is in the nearly unpreee dented position of having no cheer 
leader. We lost .last spring, by 
. graduation, Dink Merrill, who 
so ably filled the posit )n during 
the past two seasons.
The importance of a good cheer 
leader can not be rated too high. 
It has been frequently attested to 
by btfth coaches and players in 
our general assemblies that good, 
snappy cheering is invaluable to 
a winning team. Accordingly it 
should be the duty of every man 
who has ability'in that line to en
ter into the competition outlined 
as follows:
The candidates from each school 
are to lead cheers in the assem
blies of that school. The assem
blies shall by vote select i^s best 
man.
A general mass meeting on 
Tech Field has been arranged for 
Thursday, September 28th, to 
give the team a rousing send-off 
on their long Eastern journey to 
meet Yale. At this meeting each 
man will lead two cheers. By 
rising vote, the men present shall 
elect the . chief cheer leader, the 
 remaining two men to act as as
sistant cheer leaders.
The tradition makes it clear 
that no Plebe is eligible for the 
offico. All other classes are eligi
ble.
. Leaders of the various assem
blies should realize the gre im
portance of this and shoum sec 
that tile school contests are con
ducted properly.
Remember, lets beat Pitt this 
|; year. Cheering will have a big 
| part in that victory.
For the first time, Tech has won 
the Stcwardson Scholarship in 
Architecture. Not only did the 
school take first place, but also 
placed four.men out of a possible 
five in the preliminary competi
tion. Mr. 11. L. Rubin, Design, 15, 
was,awarded the scholarship. The 
four men placed for the final com
petition were Mr. Simpson, Mr. 
Griffith and Mr. Barney. The 
fifth man was Mr. John Ilarbison, 
a student of University of Penn
sylvania.
The Stcwardson . Memorial 
Scholarship in Architecture is 
available for any architect, 
draftsman or student in Pennsyl
vania. The prize offered is one 
thousand dollars ($1,000), to be 
used in trifvel and study, either at 
home or abroad, as the committee 
sees fit. This scholarship ranks 
with the Harvard Traveling Schol
arship, the Rhodes Scholarship, 
and the"Paris Prize. The juries 
are made up of noted architects, 
the jury this year consisting of 
Messrs. Cass Gilbert, W. If. Cor
bel,!:, Donn Barber and John Wynkccp. The subject of the compe
tition Lliis year was A. Military 
Center.
Although the original drawings 
of Mr. Eubin will be kept in Phil
adelphia, there will he an exhibi
tion of preliminary sketches and 
photographs of the finished work. 
The drawings and sketches' of 
Simpson, Griffith and Barney will 
also be on exhibition in the De
sign School.
Word was received on Friday, 
August 25th, that no schools in 
the State of Pennsylvania would 
be allo.wed to open until Septem
ber 18th. I'he Director was ab
sent at this time, however, and a 
conference was held at which it 
wras decided to send Dr. Marks to 
Harrisburg. At Harrisburg, Dr. 
Dixon, the Health Commission
er, told Dr. Marks that, although 
the students of colleges were not 
as susceptible to the infantile par
alysis as students in the high and 
grade schools, he did not think.it 
wise to have them come into the 
state from afflicted districts.
Notices were immediately sent 
out to all students to the effect 
that all school work would be 
postponed one week. Summer 
camp was indefinitely postponed. 
Entrance examinations were set 
forward one week and the tutor
ing classes were dropped.

OUR POLICY.
It Seems particularly appropri
ate at the commencement of a new 
undertaking; as marked b}r the 
Beginning of the school year, to 
plan the art or manner of regu
lating our conduct; to plan our 
administration; or in other words 
to form and state our policy. A 
paper without a policy is like a 
ship without a rudder, drifting 
about helplessly, its direction 
changed by every gust ol! wind. 
And so with a paper, not knowing 
what is wishes to accomplish, it 
would achieve nothing;'its edi
torial o]>ini<>11 would he changed 
by any now development and thus 
the sum total ol' good accomplish
ed would bo negligible.
Primarily our policy is the pro
motion ol the best interests ol' 
Tech. This shall always bo our 
underlying thought in any- atti
tude wo may assume, or in any 
opinions wo may express.
Having defined our policy as be
ing one to promote the best .inter
ests of Tech, wo wish, however, to 
bo more explicit, and state some 
ol: the things wo are for and 
against. We cannot, of course, 
lay down a policy which will de
termine our course of action in 
every situation. But we shall en
deavor to state as clearly as pos
sible our attitude in a few of the 
more vital issues. At this time 
we shall merely state in a general 
way the course of action we in
tend to pursue, and from time to 
time during the year develop these 
ideas.
One of the first and most im
portant points in our policy being 
our opinions in reference to the 
present system, or rather lack of 
system, of the conducting of the 
various school elections. We find 
that the average student is not 
even fairly well acquainted with 
sufficient facts concerning the 
qualifications and responsibilities 
counected with the mai\jr school 
offices, to vote intelligently for the 
proper candidate. In our next 
issue we shall present to the stu
dent body, an effective plan, ap
proved by the Deans of the four 
schools, active alumni and several 
members of the administration, 
which will put the right %man in 
the right job.
Furthermore we shall let no in
fluence stand in our way to expose 
any attempts at politics in any 
elections, such as were so plainly 
evident in several instances last 
year. Wcr need not mention them 
further,' they were too self-evi
dent !
Another thing. We have a few 
ideas on how the plebe should be
dealt with. The modern. Institu
tion is doing away with the fresh
men horseplay, this practice is 
a relic of the past. In short, we 
believe in Senior regulation rather 
than Sophomore hazing. We shall 
have more to say about this.
Wc shall endeavor to our ut
most ability to bring a closer feel
ing of unity among the four 
schools of Carnegie Tech; wc 
shall do this partly by bringing to 
the students a greater realization 
of the merits of each school, and 
by proposing plans which shall 
bring students of the different 
schools together. And in con
sistency with this policy we wish 
to say that we are strongly in 
favor of a new Y. M. C. A. move
ment at Tech, and wc are at pres
ent conducting an investigation 
which has as its object the aiding 
of the Y. M. C. A., by showing 
how this organization was started 
and developed in other schools 
throughout tlie country.
For similar reasons as stated 
above we shall do what wc can 
to promote the interests of the 
Choral Club, provided they con
tinue the excellent work done by 
them last year. The Choral Club 
last year supplied a long-felt-want 
in the student life at Tech, by 
staging a school play in which 
members from all the schools 
were represented, thus making it 
a representative student produc 
tion.
We are at all times very glad 
to publish any .news ofv clubs, or 
student organizations, which has 
enough news value to be of gen
eral interest to the student body. 
Advance notices of any nature 
will kladly be given space.
During the next school year we 
shall probably make many new 
friends, and without a doubt some 
enemies, in pursuing our policy. 
Our chief concern, however, will 
beto promote the best interests 
of Tech.
We have just heard, contrary 
to reports of last spring, that due 
to lack of adequate facilities in 
the present gymnasium, the Sen
ior,j will probably not be request
ed to attend gym. classes. No 
doubt the Seniors wish we had a 
new gymnasium.
It may be of interest to the 
dormitory men to know that dur
ing I,he summer some forty or 
more, ladies occupied the West 
Dorm, during a summer school for 
teachers. Who would have pre
dicted this?
We arc incline to believe that 
our friends in the building bureau 
are descendants of Baron Mun
chausen, after all the promises we 
have heard about the new con
crete stadium.

Colleges \ids Preparedness When It Does 
Well the Work for Which It Was Founded
 By HENRY S. PRITCHETT
President Carnegie Foundation for Advancement of Teaching
It, seems to me that the college of today does its best service 
for preparedness, even 111 the military sense, when it does well the 
work for which it has been developed, when it sends out from its 
halls youths whoso minds have been trained to serious work, who 
know .thoroughly some things, who have acquired a measure of selfdiscipline, whose souls are open to the influences which make for 
unselfishness arid for devotion, and whose conception of life has 
taught them to be tolerant of other mens opinions, to be patient 
with other mens prejudices, to be unmoved by the hatred which 
grows up so easily in the world.
And they will do their best service to the military profession if 
they insist that this profession be always on a high plane, that 
service in the army and navy shall attract the youth of highest 
ability and of the finest character, and that the men who arc to 
train the nation in readiness for whatsoever the future may bring 
shall consecrate themselves to a profession as noble, as unselfish, as 
fruitful as any that an American citizen can hope to enter.
ter the public schools as teacher.
Design School Appointees.
The Design School has appoint
ed a number of new men this year 
of whom the entire school should 
be proud. -They are all exception
ally fitted for their line of work 
and should help to uphold the 
high standard set by the school. 
In the Department of Painting 
and Dccoratioii, Mr. Rene De 
Quelin has been appointed to take 
the place of Mr. Sollom. Mr. De 
Quelin studied in Paris under 
Oaille, Paul Dubois and Falguicre. 
He extendedjiis field to designing 
for stained glass and general dec
oration. He came to New York 
in 1881, becoming assistant to 
Saint Gaudens, and executed 
murals for the Cornelius Vander
bilt mansion. He has also worked 
upon the Morgan monument, and 
the Lincoln statue in Chicago. 
For ten years he was chief design
er and decorator for the Tiffany 
Studios of New York. Mr. Sidney 
Morgan has been appointed the 
custodian of the department and 
will have charge of the equipment, 
exhibitions, etc. In the General 
Studies Department, Prof. Long, 
formerly of the Science School, 
will have charge of a course in 
Theme Writing, to be taken by all 
the plebes. The new massier of 
the Architectural Department is 
Mr. W. A. McCarty, an old Tech 
student. In the Drama Depart

have charge of the night classes 
and the classes in make-up. Mr. 
Karl Heinrich will have charge of 
the Aesthetic Dancing and Mr, 
Theodore Viehman will have

the plebes. Mr. Zeller, in the 
Sculpture Department, has a very 
able assistant in Mr. Sylvain Salieres. Mr. Salieres, while a small 
boy, amused himself modelling 
animals and soldiers while watch 
ing sheep. The Director of an Art 
School saw some of these models 
and realized the boys exceptional 
talent. A purse was made up to 
send him to the Art School at 
Toulouse. Here he won a scholar 
ship which sent him to Paris. He 
was admitted to the Ecole de 
Beaux Arts and became a student 
of Falguieres. He competed sev
eral times for the Grand Prix de 
Rome and took a second prize. He 
also won two gold medals at the 
Salon. Mr. Salieres  was the of
ficial sculptor for Russia at the 
Exposition in 1900. In this coun
try, he worked with Messrs. "War 
ten and Witmore, doing much of 
their sculpture. An exhibition of 
his work is to be held in Pitts
burgh in October.

BIG PRIZE WON BY 
J. V. WILSON, 13
Harvard Traveling Scholarship 
Taken by Former Design Ar
chitect.
Mr. J. V. Wilson, Design Arch., 
13, has won one of the most diffi
cult scholarships in the country, 
the Harvard Traveling Scholar
ship. Mr. Wilson graduated in 
Architecture in 13, then went 
abroad for study one year, return
ing the next year to Harvard, 
where he took graudate work for 
a year. He then came to Pitts
burgh, where he worked in an 
architects office, and taking a 
post-graduate course in the night 
classes at Tech.
The Harvard Traveling Schol
arship is, perhaps, the hardest 
prize to windn its class. It ranks 
with the Paris Prize and' the 
Rhodes Scholarship. It is avail
able only to Harvard students and 
provides $3,000 for European 
travel and study for three years.
Mr. Wilson does not expect to 
leave until next year.
Its about time for the graceful 
cross-country men to ramble 
briskly oer the Parks of Schenley.

DESIGN STUDENTS TD 
DEAR DEAN DDSSANOE
Policy of School to Be Outlined in 
First Meeting.
Men in Signal "Corps, Artillery, 
Engineer and Machine - Gun 
Companies.
Dean Bossange will give his 
opening address to welcome the 
new and old students at 10:30 
Friday morning, September 22nd, 
in the theatre of the Design 
School. lie will also discuss the 
new appointments in the teaching 
staff and any changes in the 
courses of study which may have 
been made.
An outline of the student organ
ization of the Design School will 
be presented to the students which 
will cover such points as the Stu
dent Senate, and various student 
organizations pertaining to the 
Design School.
The preamble to the Constitu
tion of the Senate of the Design 
School states clearly its purpose 
and activities. It reads as fol
lows :
Whereas, It seems wise that 
all activities among the students 
of the School of Applied Design 
of the Carnegie Institute of Tech
nology should be so organized and 
conducted as to INGAM for the good 
of the student body as a whole 
and for the welfare of the School 
of Applied Design, it is fitting that 
some definite organization chosen 
and controlled by the Student 
Body, and having the power to 
represent that Body, should be 
effected.
To this end it seems necessary 
that the entire undergraduate 
body be controlled by established 
rules. It is with this end in view 
that the following Constitution is 
adopted.  
In its Constitution are included 
election of Activities representa
tives and student class officers. 
The student Fund is also regu
lated by .the Senate. Regular 
meetings are called by the Pres
ident.
The Senate is composed of eight 
Senators elected in the following 
manner: Each class, Senior, Ju
nior, Sophomore, and Plcbe, shall 
elect one person as its representa
tive. Each department, Architec
ture, Painting and Decoration, 
Music and Drama, shall elect one 
person as the department repre
sentative. The chairman shall be 
the Senior class representative. 
The term of each Senator shall be 
one year.
PUPPET TECH COMIC
APPEARS IN OCTOBER
Puppet, Carnegie Techs fa 
mous, or 'perhaps rather notori
ous, comic publication will be 
inflicted upon the student body 
sometime in October, at least this 
is what its staff threatens. J. A. 
Carruthers is to be the editor this 
year, M. B. Garber the business 
manager, and Brady McSwigan 
will be the art editor.
Puppet which really fills a long 
felt want in the school is to ap
pear sis times this year. There 
will be only one decided change 
in its policy this year, and that is 
that each issue is to be better 
than the previous one. We un
derstand that Puppet mil print 
some very special M. M. C. S. 
news in their next issue, also 
some of the later versions of Dai'- 
wins theories.
NOTICE CONCERNING 
RESTAURANT
Owing to increase in cost 
of food and charges for la
bor, the management of the 
restaurant calls the atten
tion of the student-body to 
the following rates for the 
coming year:
Twenty meal tickets.. . $4.00 
Individual Meals
Breakfast ..........................20c
Lunch.................................25 c
Dinner ...............................20c

?NOTICE TO ALL ;
STUDENTS
The Faculty of the Carne- ; 
gie Institute of Technology ; 
cordially welcomes the new ; 
students. Members of the | 
Executive Staff are ready to ; 
lend their services and give 1 
advice to those who need a ' 
place to live, part-time em- ! 
ployment, or the services of 1 
a physician. We shall en- 1 
deavor to aid the Plebes in  
making the acquaintance of  
the Upper Classmen. In each  
of the four schools, also, certain groups of the faculty  
who act as Plebe advisors 
will be glad to meet the new ; 
students. Plebes may inquire ; 
at the office of the Deans, to 
which group they have been 
assigned.
There will be an assembly 
of new students to meet the 
Deans of' their respective 
Schools, at a time to be an
nounced by each Dean.
Three events are called to 
the attention of new stu
dents :
The Interclass Plebe-Sophomore contests on Friday, 
September 22.
The all-Schools Pageant 
and Burying of the Hatchet, 
to which both faculty and 
students, with their families 
and friends, are invited, on 
Tech Field, Friday evening, 
September 22, at 8:15.

EMANON CLUB
HAS NEW HOME
SCHOOL REPRESENTED 
AT PLATTSBURG
Several students and Alumni at
tended the Military Training 
Camp held at Plattsburg this 
summer.
The following is a list of the 
students who attended the camp:
H. J. Scobell, Design j W. D. 
Green, Industries j J. F. Sweeny, 
Science; W. F. McCaughoy, De
sign j W. H. Miller, Industries.
The Junior camp at .which all 
the college undergraduates and 
prep, school men attended was in 
session from July 5th to August 
5th.
As soon as the men arrived at 
the camp they were fitted out with 
rifles and uniforms, assigned to 
their respective companies and 
tents. The first one or two days 
was taken up in registration and 
fitting out. After this had been 
completed, the real work of the 
camp started. The men were 
drilled in the different military 
formations and shown how to han
dle their rifles. Practice hikes 
were taken, each man carrying a 
thirty-five pound pack besides his 
gun.
It is hoped that a larger num
ber of men will go to the camp 
next year, as it benefits the man, 
while also aiding the country.
DEAN LEETE LOSES
FORMER ASSISTANT
The vacancy caused by the 
resignation of Secretary W. P. 
Fields has been filled by Mr. H. J.- 
McCorkle, formerly assistant to 
Dean Leete. Mr. Donald R. Taft 
has been appointed to fill the office 
of assistant secretary.
Mr. Taft comes direct to Tech 
from a year of graduate work in 
Columbia, where he received a de
gree of Ph.D. in Sociology. He 
was for six years Superintendent 
of the Whitney Manufacturing 
Company, of 'Worcester, Mass. 
He left this position to take a de
gree of A. B. in Clark, later going 
to Columbia to take his M. A. de
gree.
The Emanon Club, an Industry 
organization, which was organiz
ed last year, has secured a home 
on the corner of Forbes and 
Craig streets. Although these 
men have been organized only 
one year, they have progressed 
sufficiently to form a club of a 
high standard.
ADVERTISE AND GET RESULTS
FOOTBALL SQUAD LOOKS PROMISING
(Continued Prom Page One.) 
the best, and according to present, 
indications stands a good chance 
of holding down one of the end 
positions with Gibson. Wright 
also displays considerable ability 
as a punter.
Thomas, of Lakewood High 
School, is being tried at quarter
back. Grady, of Colgate, is an
other one of the new men who 
shows exceptional signs of prom
ise for a new man, and at present 
it seems as though he will be a 
strong contestant for one of the 
tackles.
Backfield Promising.
Carnegie Tech will open the 
season with exactly the same back
field as represented Tech through
out the season last year. Kessner, 
who was undoubtedly the star of 
last years team, and probably the 
best quarterback Tech has ever 
had, is in better condition than 
ever. His playing this year will, 
without a doubt, -surpass any of 
his previous performances, partic
ularly if lie is not handicapped 
with injuries as was the ease last 
year.
Altdoerfer, Finlay, and Mar 
shall, with Brunwasser, will prob 
ably make up the backfield; there 
seems little chance of any of the 
old regulars being displaced by 
the new material, although Rupp, 
of Merccrsburg, is showing class
Another gratifying fact is that 
there will be no lack of first rate 
substitutes for the backficld 
berths, inasmuch as Ladley is 
showing some real form at quar
terback, as is Kratt at halfback. 
Finlay and Marshall should im
prove during the season, whereas 
Altdoerfer, a rather more seasoned 
player, has probably reached the 
zenith of his ability. But wc might 
mention in passing that this re
mark does in no way detract.from 
liis playing, as it will bo recalled 
that Salt is some halfback. We 
look for Marshall to show more 
such ability as he displayed in the 
Case game last year.
Line Uncertain.
At this stage of the game there 
seems to be considerable uncor 
tainty concerning the line. There 
is at, present no apparent con
tender to make Captain Hellstrom 
step any faster: Whitcy can
be counted on to play the same 
steady, plucky, and cool-headed 
game as last year. Gibson and 
Wright look the best bets for the 
end positions. Young, at guard, 
looked very good at camp ; he how
ever, is at present suffering from 
a sprained ankle, which may keep 
him out of the Yale game. Ward 
Lyons, of Elyria, Ohio, weighs 200 
pounds, is powerful, a trifle green, 
but will develop. McFeaturs, who 
played tackle last year, will prob
ably be' hard pressed with com
petitors. Other linesmen are Wil
liams, Fletcher, Kelly, Gibson and 
Perkinson, from last. year, and 
Brewer, Price and Wilford, who 
are new men.
Camp Schedule.
During the two weeks at camp 
most of the time was spent to get 
the men into condition, and to 
practice the fundamentals of the 
game. Scrimmage was held dur
ing the morning, and during the 
afternoon a long hike of six. 
eight miles was taken. The for
ward pass was developed to some 
extent in preparation for the Yale 
game. The men have been under 
the care of Trainer Murihall and 
Dr. Marks.
The prospects at present seem 
vcrjjbright for a successful team,
I andrtf the line develops to be as 
igoc as the backfield, the Tech 
te? should be a winner.
