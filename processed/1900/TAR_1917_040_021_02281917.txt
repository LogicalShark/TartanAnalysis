HAWAIIAN MUSIC BY TRIO
Last Wednesday evening, tlie Car
negie Glee and Mandolin Club, com
prising forty musicians, left the Union 
Station for New Kensington, Pa. The 
first concert of the trip was given in 
the High School auditorium, before 
an audience that taxed the capacity 
of the hall. The club members were 
entertained at the hemes of the High 
School students.
Thursday morning a stop was made 
.at Oil City. Here a party of the fel
lows were met by Samuel McNulty, 
who was a leader in the Glee Club 
last year. McNulty is now employed 
by the National Transit Company of 
Oil City, and he conducted the party 
through that great plant, which is 
comparable to the -Mesta Machine 
Coriipany in size. An afternoon train 
brought the student musicians to 
Warren, Pa., where a concert was 
.given in the Library Theater. The 
-audience-.reciuested many encores be

M0REW00D AVENUE ENTRANCE STARTED

FlynnTo Be Finished 
in Six Months
The long-expected entrance to the 
' campus from Morewood avenue will 
"become a reality when the work begun 
"by Booth & Flinn this week on the 
McGinly property is finished. This 
new work consists of cutting down the 
hill to approximately the level of 
Woodlawn avenue, where it passes the 
central buildingInstead of the proposed bridge over 
the hollow, with the gymnasium lo
cated beneath it, a dirt fill will be 
thrown across the ravine with ma
terial cut from the hill. The balance 
of the earth from the cut will be 
spread over the new athletic field, 
thereby raising its surface thirteen 
feet above the present level. This will 
also serve to increase its width by as 
much as fifty feet in some places.
The fill under the new roadway will 
be sixty feet at its greatest depth, and 
upon this a 36-foot street will be built, 
with 12-foot sidewalks on each side. 
The depth of the cut on the hill will 
vary from 33 to 52 feet. The time re
quired to effect this improvement to 
our campus will be about six months, 
or in other words, it will be finished 
before the opening of school next fall.

The annual dance of the combined 
clubs is equal in importance to the 
concert. This will be held at the Ho

after the concert. As usual, it will be' 
formal and will consist of from twenty 
to twenty-four dances.

is a guarantee Of its quality, as those 
who have attended previous Home 
Concert Dances can testify.
The Musical Club Dance is the last 
big dance of the year and the only one 
open to all classes of all schools. It 
affords an excellent opportunity for 
the new students to become acquaint
ed with the members of the oldest suc
cessful activityan activity that has 
been in existence for twelve years,

other to bring Carnegie Tech before

VARSITY FORCED 10 PLAY TWO EXTRA PERIODS WITH LEHIGH
Letter Men Organize Clan 
Pleased With Showing 
of Team
After watching the Tech basketball 
team defeat Lehigh, some eighty letter 
men assembled in the Union and there 
organized the Carnegie 'Varsity CV.n. 
The meeting was opened with a short 
talk from Director Hamerschlag, in 
which he outlined the athletic problem 
that is confronting Tech. Manager 
Gearhart then asked permission to ap
point Mr. Duff temporary cliairman of 
the meeting. When this had been 
done, TVIr. Gearhart presented a design 
for the Clan Pin, and also the draft 
of a proposed constitution. The former 
was approved and the latter adopted 
with some variation. Among other 
things the Clan decided to make their 
annual dues sufficient to include a sub
scription to The Tartan, beginning 
next fall. Officers were elected by the 
Clan as follows:
President, Clarence Overend, hockey 
captain, '06; First Vice President, 
Salt Altdoerfer; Second Vice Presi
dent, D. W. Waite, '11 track captain; 
Third Vice President, Guy I-Iarferty, 
letter man in football, baseball and 
track; Secr.etary-Treasurer, J. It. Gear
hart, present graduate manager.
The Director, in opening the meoting, said that the question of an ath
letic field, along with other tiling, 
constituted a serious problem in Tech 
athletics, but that a group like the 
'Varsity Clan could overturn moun
tains in helping toward its solution. 
The chief ways in which the Clan can 
help, he said, are to Impress upon tho 
present teams the necessity of improvI ing their public performance, and to. 
arouse interest outside the school, so 
I that the^re may be a larger attendance 
j at the games. Manager Gearhart sup(Continued on Page Four.j
Overtime Necessary to De
cide the GameFinlay 
Scores Final Point
In the last moment of a second ex
tra period of play in the most exciting 
home game of the year with the Le
high five, the Tech passers won by a 
single point 36 to 35. A foul goal by 
Abrams turned the trick after a mul
titude of queer, kinks and twists of 
fate.
The game had seemed a sure victory 
for Tech towards the end of the sec
ond half only to. be tied up 27 to 27 
at the last minute by a spurt of Le
high; then later it seemed hopelessly 
lost at the end of an extra five minuates, as Lehigh had a two point lead 
and there was only a second more to 
play, when Finlay launched a pretty 
throw that again tied the score ne
cessitating the . second extra period. 
In every case the deciding play came 
in the last fraction of a minute.
The Lehigh passers were far the 
quickest men at breaking up plays and 
Intercepting passes that have been 
seen on our floor this season. The 
Skibos evened Ibis up by close guard
ing and tight defence around their 
basket. Even at that Lehigh shot five 
more field goals than Tech did. 
Abrams kept the varsity in the run
ning by his steady foul shooting with 
20 fouls out of 29 attempts. Dynan 
who got eight field goals in the Le
high game on the Lehigh floor was 
held to a single basket.
Tho Plaid passers led at the end of 
the first half with a score of 17 to 13. 
Abrams shot two field goals and 
Greene one, while for Lehigh McCar
thy dropped three In and Wysoeky 
one. Dynan was off on fouls getting 
one out of seven. Crichton did bet
ter with five out of six. Abrams placed

At a mass meeting at Washington,

irom many colleges for the purpose of 
impressing upon Congress and the

Carl C. Greiner, the president of the

NIGHT STUDENTS HOLD

First in History of the School 
W as a Complete Success
Wednesday, February 21, for the 
first time since night, classes were or

of all four schools got together in a 
general assembly. Director Hamer
schlag, in charge of the meeting, com
menced by giving a brief outline of the 
evenings program, and to make the 
students thoroughly at home, he In
vited their respective senior presi- . 
dents to places on the platform.
Behind the speakers and leaders of 
the assembly, tho Symphony Orches

THE NATION AND THE UNIVERSITY
Two weeks ago in the editorials of this paper there appeared an 
editorial entitled Our Country, in which we set forth the ideals 
of patriotism. We stated that in previous critical times the col
lege man had always evidenced his love for the country, and done 
his share and duty.
Since this time colleges .throughout the nation have been giv
ing serious thought to the problem, which may at any time confront 
the United States. Some institutions Itavc organized a system of 
military training; engineerings corps have been started; and vari
ous other preparedness propaganda have been set in motion. With
in our own- school engineering students have taken government 
examinations, for the various departments. A case is cited of an 
alumnus who has enlisted in the aviation corps, and so on. It is 
reported that a petition has been circulated among some of the 
faculty advocating military training at Tech. This report has 
however not been confirmed as we go to press.
The Tartan has recently received a communication from the 
, Yale Daily News, which reads in part as follows:
Believing most sincerely in the principle of national defense 
and the system of universal military training which would be most 
practical in the United States under existing conditions, the Yale 
News has arranged to send literature and propaganda on this sub
ject to college and school publications throughout the country, 
through an arrangement betwoen the Yale News Press Bureau and 
the (!onTerence Committee n National Preparedness.
This literature will bo sent to you upon publication and you 
are at liberty to make use of any of it as you sec fit. This will 
incur no obligation beyond the fact that the Yale News Press 
Bureau should be mentioned.
It is hoped that this plan may in some small way help toward 
the solution ol! this great national problem of preparedness.
These facts all point toward the trend ol! thought that colleges 
are giving the groat national problem. The time is not far distant 
when the Carnegie Institute ol! Technology must take a stand* As 
a recognized institution, Toch should bo a leader not a fol
lower. This is no time for waiting to see what the other fellow 
is going to do. Vacillation and procrastination are earmarks of 
the follower. Initiative and organization mark the leader. 
Which shall it be?
In accordance with the invitation and opportunity extended 
to,,The Tartan by the Yale Daily News we shall publish lit* erature concerning national preparedness.
Incidentally we wish to call attention to an article appearing 
in another column of this issue concerning the action of a group of 
college students, who held a convention at Washington last Thurs
day for the purpose of impressing upon Congress and the Pres
ident the advisability of a national referendum on the questions of 
Avar. This idea seems to us to be ridiculous. Is not the case of 
national honor clear enough without such a measure? Are not our 
legislators capable of directing the course of the nation, without the 
vote of the people? Not to say anything about how cumbersome 
this system would be.
The college man bears a definite relation to his country. For 
this reason it is imperative that Carnegie Tech shall take a stand 
concerning -wlmt part it is to take in the problem now confronting 
the nation. What shall it be?
THE HOME CONCERT
With this issue appears the announcement of the program and 
plans of the Musical Clubs for the coining Home Concert, to be hold 
a week from Friday. From the information we have been able to 
gathor concerning the work of the clubs in concerts given by thorn 
This year we unhesitatingly say, that it is our belief, that this years 
Home Concert will surpass those of other years, in just the same 
way that; the Junior Prom did last. week.
The Homo Concert oilers to the student not. only the opportu
nity of being pleasantly entertained, but also the opportunity of 
hearing some music well worth while, and to support one of the 
Most worthy student activities tit. Tech.
The first appearance of the clubs for the present season was 
the usual charity concert at Marshalsea and this was followed by 
a benefit, at. the East Liberty Branch Library. Efforts were then 
concentrated upon a short trip during the first .part of the Christ
mas vacation. This was started with the concert at Youngstown on De
cember 18th. Thirteen men stood in the audience during the singing of 
Alma Mater. This is evidence of the constant growth of our alumni 
body in other cities than Pittsburgh. On the 19th the clubs appeared in Akron under the joint aus
pices of the Smilers Club and the 
"Tech Clan-of Akron.
The clubs have been rehearsing con
tinuously since the first of the year 
for the Washington's Birthday trip 
,and for the home concert. The for
mer was started with a concert at New 
Kensington on February 21. At War
ren, Pa., the men were well received 
and were entertained with a dance 
after the concert. The final appear
ance was at Erie where the applause 
was very generous.
All these concerts have given the 
men an opportunity to become accus
tomed to their work, and the directors 
time to try out and perfect their num
bers for the principal concert of the 
season, the annual home concert.
The musical clubs have done a great 
work for Tech by bringing the name 
of the school to-many people outside 
of the city in a manner most favorable 
to the institution. Press comments, 
not always favorable,in their criticism 
of such organizations, have highly 
praised the work of the musical clubs 
this year.

('Continued From Pace One.) 
United States Flag hanging from the 
great organ. Seizing this as an ap
propriate opportunity, the Director de
li,vered. a patriotic address in which he 
emphasized the need of presenting a 
united front to the present Interna
tional situation, and called for loyal 
support of the government on tlie part 
of every man and woman in Carnegie 
Tech. While the spot-light still shone 
upon the Flag, and the rest of the hall 
remained in darkness, the assembly 
arose and sang the National Anthem, 
The Star-Spangled Banner. Fol
lowing this, Miss Sara Sutter sang a 
solo, and in response to the applause 
of the audience came back for an en
core.
The Director next introduced Judge 
Macfarlane, one of the Trustees, who 
in speaking of the difficulty of saying 
a few words, remarked that his pro
fessional duties required him to lis
ten to many statements of facts, and a 
great many things that are not facts; 
and that he had reached the conclu
sion that he and all the other judges 
in Allegheny county would have but 
little to do if people would only make 
their bargain, without talking all 
around Robin Hoods barn.
Dean Connelly spoke upon the value 
of the possession of the spirit of joy 
in life. He also said that the niglit 
students should make the absent ones 
show up at the next general assembly, 
although just then the missing ones 
might be filled with the "spirit of joy 
in life or some other spirits.
Deans Leete and Bossange made 
short addresses, following which the 
Symphony Orchestra played an Eng
lish folk-song, entitled Molly On the 
Shore, by Grainger. After singing the

cess, ask any of the Glee or Mandolin 
club men. Every detail was designed 
to afford something of interest for the 
boys from Tech, and they, in turn, 
proved themselves worthy of the kind
nesses bestowed.
The last concert was given at Erie, 
Pa., where the High School students 
welcomed the club. The concert was 
given in the High School auditorium, 
Friday evening, before an enthusiastic 
andience. The next morning some of 
the fellows went out on the ice at 
Lake Erie and inspected a United 
States revenue dutter. At 10:50 Satur
day morning the party left for Pitts
burgh, arriving home at 2:30.
The Mandolin and Glee. Club mem 
bers are unanimous in their elation 
over the success of the trip. They de
clare it to be the best of the season, 
and this assures a continuance of the 
away-from-home concerts during cer
tain periods of the school year.

eleven out of fifteen through the bas
ket.
During the second half Barrett re
placed Dynan and Foxen went in for 
Levy. All, of the Lehigh tossers 
scored a basket in this period^ except
ing Kennedy while Greene registered 
two for Tech. Crichton got four out 
of five attempts at fouls and Abrams 
six out of ten. Up to the last minute 
the varsity led by a score of 27 to 22.' 
Then two field goals and a foul tied 
up the score at 27 to 27.
The first five minutes extra was. full 
of fast playing in which Greene scored 
a basket, Crichton one and Barrett 
two. Lefty shot two out of three fouls 
and the scene was set for Finlay's 
trying shot which made the score 33 
to 33.
In the second five minutes Abrams 
shot one field goal and a foul while 
McCarthy was getting but one for his 
team. In this period the guarding 
was very close.
In attendance at the game was a 
good sized bunch of Carnegie C 
men, who rooted loudly for Captain 
Greenes men.
The next game scheduled is with 
Westminster for Saturday March 3.
Scoops Carey, our big center, who 
was injured in the first Lehigh game 
will be out for some time if not the 
whole season. Scoops got kicked in 
the knee during the contest. It de
veloped into water on the knee and he 
had to stay in bed the remainder of 
the trip. He is' able to get around 
now but the joint is still very painful. 
Scoops loss will be keenly felt.

seemingly as full of enthusasim as 
the dancers and the music was all that 
could have been desired. The pro
pram was played through without a 
hitch.
After the fifteenth dance the one 
hundred and forty couples led by the 
patrons and patronesses, filed down 
to the banquet hall. The hall, decor
ated in pink marble and gilded orna
ments was filled with small tables 
which seated two couples each. The 
revellers were here served with oys
ter croquettes, creamed asparagus, 
bread and butter, ice cream, cake and 
coffee.
The latter half of the dance was 
even better than the first. Bright, 
fluffy, paper caps and novelties 
heightened the amusement and fur
thered the fun.
The committee deserves earnest 
praise for their efficient manner of 
presenting and carrying out the de
tails of the Prom. Who cares if he 
must subsist on two meals a day in
stead of three for a few weeks. The 
price of the Prom is not regretted. 
The committee were J. L. Miller, chair

VARIETY OF MUSIC OPPORTNITY FOR TALENT
(Continued From Page One.) 
ring selection is noted for its wonder
ful harmony and is well chosen to 
show the perfect balancing of the 
voices of the Glee Club.
Besides the more serious works, 
several humorous selections are also 
presented: Among these are The
Elephant and the Chimpanzee, The 
Musical Trust, Hong Kong Ro
mance, and The Keys of Heaven.
In the second part the singers have 
arranged a tabloid minstrel show. The 
interlocutor is Mr. Battey, and the 
end-men Messrs. Yost, Sandow, Reid 
and Truitt. Ballads by Messrs. Welter, 
Olsen, Jamison and Sharp. This is 
the first attempt at th production of 
an entertainment of this kind, but the 
clubs feel certain that the effort will 
be well received.
The Mandolin Club, under the direc
tion of Sgn. Scalzo, is striving to out
shine all its previous efforts. The 
men have worked diligently upon their 
program and they feel that the audi
ence will be pleased, as they always 
have been. The first number, The 
Meteor March, by Rice, is a stirring 
composition with lots of snap and it 
always calls for an encore. The se
lection from the opera, Blue Para
dise, which is so popular throughout 
the country, is certain to be well re
ceived. The Santiago Waltz, which 
was written by A. Corbin especially 
for the mandolin and guitar, is anoth
er good number, and shows plainly the 
possibilities of the Mandolin club as a 
musical organization. While the Se
lection is a waltz, it has dash and 
spirit which ranks it with the best of 
the marches. Herberts Serenade 
is a delightful composition which pos
sesses that charm which is always in 
evidence in this composers work, and 
is one of his best productions. Old 
Glory, a medley of national airs, 
closes the program and gives the nec
essary patriotic atmosphere to the 
concert.
The Mandolin Club is working on a 
number of specialties which as yet 
are kept secret by their originators, 
but various hints which have been 
given out, seem to indicate that 
they are of a humorous nature. Cost 
and Sweeny are still members of the 
organization and it is not unlikely 
that those who are interested in 
Hawaiian music will be given the op
portunity to hear these talented per
formers.
The reader for this season, while a 
comparatively new man about the 
schools, is one of the best that we 
have ever had. Mr. Reid was dis
covered at last years football 
smoker, and has received rounds of 
applause at every performance. His 
work is excellent and his selections 
new and entertaining.
In his address before the 'Varsity 
Clan, last Friday, Director Hamer
schlag announced that the plan of 
building a new gym and stadium has 
been abandoned for the present. The 
plan has been to build a bridge across 
from Forbes street, with the gym un
derneath it and the stadium between 
it and the Margaret Morrison School. 
As originally planned by the archi
tects that would have cost ?250,000; 
under present war prices for steel it 
would be nearer $600,000. With such 
prohibitive prices existing the plan 
has been completely abandoned. The 
new scheme is to cut down McGinley 
hill, as before, but to dump the dirt 
into the ravine and thus make a dirt 
road instead of a bridge across from 
Forbes street. That plan, of course, 
necessitates the schools buying new 
land for the gym and stadium. Noth
ing definite is known about that at 
present, but the money for the gym
nasium has already been set aside, 
and some announcement as to new 
plans will probably be made next fall.
The Director went on to say that 
perhaps this waiting will be the best 
thing in the end. The school is grow
ing more rapidly than anyone expect
ed, and the proposed gymnasium 
might have been too small. The 
school does not want a gymnasium 
which, before it was finished, would 
be outgrown. That possibility was 
made doubly striking by the presence 
of the older letter men who attended 
school when the first part of the In
dustry Building was too large for all 
the schools together. Now the Indus
tries School has not enough room for 
its own students. The Science Plebes 
more than fill the lecture room in 
their'school. The Margaret Morrison 
School desires a half million dollars 
for expansion. The Design School has 
tripled its floor area in a few years. 
The Carnegie Union is too small for 
many of the schools social functions. 
Each of the schools is expanding rap
idly, and the striking thing about that 
expansion is the fact that much of the 
growth is coming in the number of 
graduate students from other col
leges seeking intensive work. Tech 
is repeating the history of M. I. T., 
which has more graduate students in 
proportion than any othQr school in 
the country. These facts show that 
the postponement of the gym, disap
pointing as it is, may be a good thing 
in the end.
stand him. We hope this was not his 
last as well as his first meeting with 
us.
Next Sunday there will be another 
fine speaker. These meetings are held 
in the W. Dorm. Club Room at 2:15 
every Sunday afternoon lasting about 
three-quarters of an hour. All are wel
come.
SOUTHERN CLUB 
ENTERTAINS AT SMOKER
THETA XI ENJOYS 
DINNER AT FORT PITT
The active members of Pi Chapter 
of Theta Xi and alumni residing in 
this district, enjoyed a sumptuous din
ner at the Fort Pitt Hotel on Satur
day evening, February 24. The affair 
was an overflow meeting, taking place 
at the same time as the banquet of the 
National Convention in session at the 
Waldorf Astoria, New York City. Hor
ace, F. Gibson represented the local 
chapter at the convention. Word was 
received that a chapter was granted 
to the Engineers Lodge of the Univer
sity of Wisconsin, at Madison, Wis.
M. M. C. S. CLASS OF15 
ENTERTAINED AT TEA
The girls of the Class of 15 were 
entertained on Saturday afternoon, 
February 24, by Miss Francis Parry, 
honorary member of the class, at her 
home on Forbes street. Miss Ruth 
Welty was elected representative to 
the Alumnae Association as successor 
to Miss Eliza Dickey, who expects to 
go East in March to take up Social 
Service Work. Miss Louise MacMil
lan was elected chairman of the .So
cial Committee for the coming year.
The doors of the Southern Club were 
thrown open wide last Wednesday 
evening and the club entertained with 
smokes, eats and burlesque for the 
Southern men in school who have not 
yet affiliated with the club.
For the entertainment of the visi
tors Messrs Stone and Stone feeling 
pugilistically inclined staged a bout 
which fortunately resulted in no 
broken bones. Messrs Wilson and 
Sutton renowned slapstick artists, 
gave a little exhibition of how rotten 
an amateur can be in near comedy 
However they also escaped without any 
broken bones. A. J. Baird sang some 
of his coon songs in his inimitable 
way, accompanied by Mr. Chesterman 
on the mandolin. The Glub then un
covered a genius in the form of Henry 
Fuller who was there on the black 
face, and Charlie Chaplin stuff. Fred 
Stone did some near magic, and with 
a few other burlesque stunts the per
formance closed and the curtain rang 
down on one of the most versatile 
theatrical troupes ever sheltered under 
the Southern Club roof.
Messrs. McCorkle and Gage, honor
ary members, were present, and 
when interviewed after the smoker de
clared they had a bully time which 
was seconded by every one else pres
ent. Mr. Morehead, who hails from 
Virginia, a member of the Design 
faculty was also an honor guest.

MTORKLE SPEAKS TO DORM BIOLE CLASS
Those who did not attend the Bible 
class meeting in the W. Dorm Club 
room last Sunday afternoon missed 
a very Inspiring talk on "Visions of 
a Purpose in Life, py Mr. H. J. Mcr 
Corkle. Mr. McCorkle has that pleas
ing personality which draws the at
tention of his audience and which 
makes them listen to him and underAt a matinee performance Friday 
afternoon In the theater of the School 
of Applied Design, another group of 
Plebes gave the comedy Holbein in 
Blackfriars, before a well filled 
house. The play is a collaboration by 
tenneth Sawyer Goodman and Thomas 
Wood Stevens and came as a happy 
relief after the series of Jeaw Maries 
The Paternostersand The 
Dead Are Dead, with which the 
public have been regaled.
There was something refreshing 
in the spontaneous bursts of laughter 
that came from certain quarters of 
the house and one came away without 
that morbid feeling that one had been 
at the morgue.
If the fun was a trifle rough at times 
it was wholesome and robust. The 
appeal was distinctly human and the 
selection of this comedy proved for
tunate for the Plebes.
The entire cast entered into the spir
it of the thing with commendable vi
gor. The performance was smooth 
and rapid, as a comedy should be 
thanks to Mr. Arleigh B. Williamson, 
who was stage director.
Mr. Nicholas Muller as Maxon the 
Model, delighted his audience with 
his very interesting makeup and his 
rolubility in regard to me beautiful 
andsme be-er, and the ways of 
them furinerswhile Mr. Geo. Tabert gave a very good account of him
self as Holbeins, the artist.
For a bit of capital character acting 
Mr. Wm. Veihman's Old Gentleman, 
in search of a design for a German 
store, deserves special mention. His 
sudden rush on to the stage and the 
way he absorbed one's attention, for 
the very brief period he was thqre, 
proved that he knew his business anrl 
how to make the most of a small part.
Mr. Harry Bowers, In the role ,pf 
Henry VIII, was the source of much 
merriment, lending to the boisterous 
and much married King Harry a 
qalnt humor that was rather unex
pected and amusing. His chagrin and 
disgust over the portrait of his pros
pective bride, Anne of Cleras, was 
perhaps his best work. One could not 
resist secretly sympathizing with his 
kinship In this impending calamity.
Miss Margaret Ravencroft as the 
sobbing Meg Chepeter, proved quite
a success. There was something so 
substantial in her sobs that they wore 
comforting rather than distressing. 
Ono is suro the victim of such sorrow 
will havo ono excellent appotlto after 
It. is ovor. Miss Ravonscroft possess
es a voico which properly placed and 
controlled, will contribute much to hor 
success in certain roles to which hor 
talent is especially adaptod.
Miss Erdono Winters had vory little 
opportunity to demonstrate any his
trionic ability sho may possess 
"Mistress Chopotor bolng a rather un
grateful role. The samo may bo said 
for Mr. David Clalhor, who was cast 
as the "Old Gentleman in search of 
rare prints."
B. Irving Dickinson as "Thomas 
Cromwell, Earl of Essox, won his 
spurs almost the moment lie stepped 
on the boards. Ono foil Immediately, 
hero Is somoono who acts in spite of 
himself. His nervous manner and 
spooch as ho sought to soeuro tho 
portrait to present to tho king- In 
short, his ontlro presentation of the 
character was vital and convincing. 
Ho has a very pleasing quality of 
volco and sincerity appears to bo the 
keynote of his work and that Is al
ways to win In any art. It was this 
ciuality that made his work noticeably 
Interesting In "Tho Land of Hearts 
Desire.
Tho "ont.ro act contribution from 
tho department of music deserves notlco. Mr. Clias. JO. Gilson gtivo two 
vory interesting solo numbers on the 
organ, "Molody by Alox Gullman and 
Allegretto from Fourth Sonata, Men
delssohn.
Mr. Thomas Wood Stevons Is to be 
congratulated on having Ills two plays, 
"The Flight of Dlerde and Holbein 
In Blackfriars, presented in so artis
tic a manner by an entire Plebe cast. 
That the Plebes appreciated their ob
ligation and Mr. Stevens' generosity 
in entrusting them with his plays, 
their work proves.
The public will look forward to the 
production of other play's, from the 
aume pen, with interest and a "Plebe 
Performance will be no long* a 
thing from which to flee.
DRAMATIC DEPT. TO ENTERTAIN STAR

School in 1912, received an ovation 
when they appeared in concert last

Good musicanshlp marked their

of simplicity In the face of a fool.

THE HALLER BAKERY @ 
3610 FORBES STREET Hi 
^ Iroquois Block.  
Aiming to preserve Carnegie Instltute as-a center for all the artistic 
activities of Pittsburgh, the board of 
trustees of the institute will meet, 
within the next two weeks, to take 
action upon a project to expend a 
quarter of million dollar for a sweeping reconstruction of Carnegie Music 
hall, which, with but small disturb
ance of its intimate atmosphere, will 
make It suitable for the largest or
chestral and choral concerts, and for 
dramatic productions as well.
In addition to the rebuilding of the 
music hall organ, at a cost of $27,000, 
the contract for which already has 
been awarded, the proposed remodel
ing of the hall, plans for which are 
thus far purely tentative, will include 
the moving of the stage to a point 40 
feet behind where it now stands, the 
extension and regrading of the two 
balconies, the addition of 600 seats, 
which will increase the seating capa
city to approximately 2,600, and many 
other secondary alterations.
One Step Among Many.
The project for remodeling the 
music hall has been crystallized, it is 
said, by the withdrawal of the Phila
delphia Orchestra from the auditor
ium for the concluding three concerts 
of its present Pittsburgh series on the 
ground that the hall is not wholly 
adapted to the performance of sym
phonic programs. Officials of the 
board of trustees, who made public 
today the plans under consideration, 
said that they are merely a step 
toward the completion of the work of 
reconstruction at the institute, which 
began with the expansion of the li
brary building in 1907.
In order to remodel the music hall, 
It was explained, it will be necessary 
practically to wreck the auditorium, 
leaving only the walls and roof in
tact. To obtain the additional depth 
of 40 feet for which the plan calls, 
the stage must be moved to a point in 
the inner court of the institute buildIhg. If this is done the dressing 
rooms now directly behind the stage 
must be demolished, the passageway 
from the library to the departments 
of line arts and of the museum must 
be eliminated, and, in all probability, 
a portion of the offices of Chief Li
brarian, Harrison W. Carver, of the 
library, will be used.
To Enlarge Stage.
The plan, us it now stands, provides 
for retaining the double proscenium 
arch of the present stage, with its 
four stage boxes, somewhat diminish
ed in size. The stage itself is to be 
Increased both In depth and width, 
Tho canting of the stage to a some
what, steeper slopo, and tho flooring 
of tho platform with tho softest pine 
to tho thickness of at least one Inch, 
to provide more satisfactory condlLETTER JEN ORGANIZE CLAN

plemented tho Directors' remarks by 
urging tho men of tho Clan to use 
their influence with present High 
School athletes to persuade them to 
come to Tech. He announced that the 
members of the Clan will be able to 
keep in touch with the athletic situa
tion through passes to be issued by 
the Board of Control. These passes 
will be honored only in connection 
with the pin of the Clan.'
The pin!, as approved, at the meeting, 
will be a small gold button 10 be worn 
in lapel of the coat. The insignia on 
the pin will be an enameled C, 
striped with the four colors of the 
Tartan plaid, and containing with it 
the symbol of the sport in which it 
was won. These symbols will be a 
football, basketball, baseball, winged 
foot, tennis racket and crossed hockey 
sticks.
The constitution which was adopted 
by the Clan provides for honorary and 
regular members, the latter class be
ing sub-divided into graduates and un
dergraduates. All regular members 
pay an initiation fee of $3; this fee 
and the filling of an application blank 
are the only requirements which letter 
men have to fulfill in order to become 
members. It is not necessary for a 
man to have completed his course in 
school, and it is not necessary for 
his application for membership to bo 
votod upon. Graduate members shall 
pay annual duos of $3, which>includes 
a subscription to The Tartan. Under
graduate members pay no duos. Tho 
men v >o wore present at the mooting 
last Friday are to be tho charter members of tho Clan.

tions for orchestral performance, also 
are being considered.
The old dressing rooms behind the 
stage are to be done away with, and 
new dressing rooms of more practical 
type are to be constructed. The nar
row stairway leading down from the 
dressing room level to the platform 
level, down which many artists have 
gone to appear before Pittsburgh audi
ences, will be removed and the artists 
will go on the stage from the same 
level.
The rebuilding of the organ will in
crease its size until it stretches the 
width of the platform, at the back, in
stead of only a portion of it. This re
building, which has been- planned in 
detail by Charles I-Ieinrotli, city or
ganist, will equip the instrument with 
every modern stop and pipe, and will 
add a set of chimes, making the or
gan,. it is believed, the most complete 
in this country. The contract was let 
a week ago yesterday to the Ernest 
M. Skinner Company of Boston, Mass.
Seats Rearranged.
By the provisions of the present 
plan every seat in the reconstructed 
auditorium will have a direct view of 
all the stage. This rearrangement, it 
is said, has been one of the most 
needed improvements, since, while all 
the seats in the auditorium have been 
suitable- for musical performances, a 
portion of them have been less satis-, 
factory for illustrated lectures and 
dramatic or spectacular performances.
The lines of the proposed recon
structed hall are planned to face di
rectly upon the stage. The 600. seats 
to be added are to be distributed 
among the three floors, and to be set 
in a.t the front of. the present seating 
plan.
The additional 40 feet of depth, it is 
said, would permit fully 1,500 seats 
to be added to the present capacity. 
Instead, the trustees are considering 
spacing the rows so that ample room 
will be given in each seat, both for 
its occupant and for those who may 
find it necessary to pass along the 
row. In this connection the plan pro
vides for tho removal of the present 
seats and the installation ot new seats 
of the most modern and comfortable 
type.
Can Handle Scenery.
Concerning the reconstruction of 
the stage, it is proposed to equip it 
with an asbestos curtain and other 
curtains, and with equipment for the 
handling of scenery. This will not 
mar the beauty oil tho hall as a con
cert auditorium, since it is understood 
that these curtains are concealed, ex
cept when in use.'" A pit"also is to be 
provided on tho auditorium floor in 
front of tho stage for an orchestra in 
the theater sonso.
The extension of both balconies 
toward tho stage, which would be 
made possible by tho added depth of 
the auditorium, will permit the re 
grading of the balconies to a less 
steop incline. Consideration also is 
boing given to a suggested separate 
entrance to tho second balcony, from 
tho foyer, the second balcony being 
cut off from entrance to the first bal
cony, so that, when school events and 
others are being held, the second bal 
cony, if not needed, may be closed.
The extension of the stage into the 
inner court of the institute building 
has brought forth the suggestion that 
a roof of glass be constructed at the 
second-floor level of the court, and 
that the area be set with fountains, 
about which exhibits of. the depart
ment of the museum might be ar
ranged.
May Start This Year.
In the proposed plan, according to 
institute officials, every precaution 
has been taken to maintain the re
cital hall character of the auditorium. 
Investigation has shown that 80 per 
cent of the engagements in Carnegie 
Music hall bring an audience of from 
1,500 to 2,000, while only the remain
ing 20 per cent require a seating capa
city in excess of those figures. Since, 
however, a large proportion of these 
engagements are orchestra concerts, 
and since it is the expressed desire of 
officials to make the music hall the 
musical center of the community, the 
proposed change, in view of modern 
progress, is deemed necessary.
The meeting of tho hoard of trus
tees to pass on the plans probably will 
be hold in the institute. Should the 
board approve, tho matter of obtain
ing the necessary funds will bo taken 
up with tho corporation in Now York, 
which now has charge of the money 
which Andrew CUrnegio lias set aside 
for his public and philanthropic work. 
It is understood that the obtaining of 
the necessary amount is quite prob
able.
Whether the work on the "recon
struction of. the music hall is to begin 
with the close of the present season, 
or is to be deferred for a year, rests 
with the action of the trustees.. If 
begun in the spring, it will be com\
