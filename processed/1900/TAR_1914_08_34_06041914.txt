TECH LOSES IO PITI 
III (LOSE (AME
On Thursday, May 26, Pitt won 
from Tech in a game which rested on 
the shoulders of the pitchers. Ryan 
pitched a splendid game. He allowed 
a triple and three singles, and struck 
out ten men. Langdon was reached 
for seven hits, one of which was a 
double, and struck out eleven men. 
The hits on both sides were so well 
scattered that the bases were never 
filled.
Englehart started off for Pitt by 
getting to first on a walk. He stole 
second and Beattie struck out. Dil
lon was thrown out at first by Oeffinger. Healy winged and Englehart 
scored. In the second inning Wil
liamson lost the ball on the cliff for 
a three bagger and scored on Hayes 
hit.
Techs first tally came in the first 
also. Kreider walked and was sent 
to second and third by Oeffingers 
and Brines sacrifice hits, and then 
stole home, while DeMuth was at 
bat. The innings then went in quick 
-succession till the sixth, when Hum
phries scored Techs second and last 
run. DeMuth and Lain struck out 
and then Humphries lined out a two 
bagger and scored on Kruinms 
single. The seventh inning was uneventual. Englegart started for Pitt 
in the eighth by striking out. Beat
tie singled and reached third on 
steals. Dillon was at bat and Beat
tie was taking trial runs half way 
down the home and back to third. 
While Ryan was winding up Bettie 
started for home and by the time 
Ryan unwound and threw the ball 
Dillon and Lain and Beattie were in 
a heap at the home plate and Pitt had 
scored the winning run, making the 
score 32.

IE SECOND AT WESTMINSTER
WRIGHT BREAKS SCHOOL RECORD IN POLE VAULT
Continued on Page 8
The Tech track team closed its 1914 
season last Saturday by taking sec
ond place in the intercollegiate meet 
held under the auspices of Westmin
ster College at New Wilmington, Pa., 
The second day was ideal and a large 
crowd of spectators was on hand to 
cheer the college as well as school 
athletics who were competing for in
terscholastic honors. Five colleges 
took part in the meet, which Pitt won 
with a total of an even hundred 
points, while Tech made 61, West
minster 35, Geneva 19, and Grove City 
8. The Pitt team was well balanced, 
as is evinced by the fact that Blue 
and Gold men scored in every event 
and in only two of these did they 
earn less than five points. Carnegie 
failed to place in but one event and 
made the best showing in high jump 
and pole vault in which 7 1-2 and 7 
points, respectively, were annexed. 
Pitt won twelve of the fifteen indi
vidual contests, Tech took two firsts 
and Geneva one.
The track was a very poor one, it 
being wide enough for only three 
lanes. The 100-yard dash was run 
across the field, ending near a jump
ing pit. Regardless of this disadvan
tage, a new record was made on the 
century sprint. Favored by a light 
wind at their backs, J. Marshall of 
Pitt and Quay of Geneva ran a dead 
heat in the trials in 10 seconds flat. 
Then, in the finals, Marshall got a 
better start than the others and fin
ished first in the same time, estab
lishing a new Western Pennsylvania 
intercollegiate record, which is 1-5 
second better than the former one. 
The biggest and most pleasant sur
prise of the meet from a Carnegie 
standpoint was Wrights victory over 
McMasters of Pitt in the pole vault. 
From comparative showings in earlier 
meets, the Blue and Gold vaulter was 
the favorite over his Plaid rival, but 
Hal upset the dope in addition 
to his opponents over confidence. 
Wright cleared 11 feet 4 inches on the 
first attempt and then stood idly by 
watching McMasters make three vain 
efforts to do the same thing. Mc
Masters would no doubt have done 
better had he not wasted a great deal 
of energy in clearing the low heights 
by large distances. Wright was con
tent simply to get over the bar and 
in the end was the winner, setting a 
new Carnegie record in the bargain.
Quay of Geneva was the individual
point winner, making 12 by virtue of 
a first, a second, and a third place. 
He was closely followed by West
minsters star, G. Vincent, who took 
three thirds and a fourth for a total 
of 11 points. J. Marshall, McClure 
and Scott of Pitt won two races, se
curing 10 points each. Capt. Clair 
was Carnegies largest point earner. 
Wright made 7 1-2 points, just 1-2 
point less than the number obtained 
by his captain, and 1-2 more than that 
gained by Hemmann.
All but one of the thirty men taken 
on the trip were instrumental in 
running up Techs score. Hemmann 
equalled his best time of 10 1-5 sec
onds in his trial heat of the 100-yard 
dash and Kirk ran second. In the 
final, Hemmann got a poor start and 
was only able to take third place. 
Kirk pulled up near the end, almost 
beating out his teammate, but had to 
be content with fourth place. Mac
Millan lost the mile race within five 
yards of the tape, where Grumbling 
forged ahead and managed to push 
his body past the line first. Handelman ran a good race, finishing well up 
with the winners in fifth place. The 
track was so narrow that the hurdle 
and 220-yard flat races had to be run 
in heats against time. Scott won both 
of the former easily, showing to good 
advantage, particularly in the high 
hurdles. Blumenthal of Tech, who 
has been steadily improving, was 
fourth, and King, fifth, while Mere
dith dragged his long legs over the 
lower obstacles to the fourth posi
tion in the other hurdle race. The 
220-yard sprint proved an exciting and 
close struggle, in which Hemmann 
ran second to Marshall of Pitt, barely 
beating out Quay, who was third. 
Kirk ran a dead heat with Rosenthal 
of Pitt and the two tied for fourth 
honors. In the 440-yard dash Quay 
of Geneva led all the Dunseith
trailed in sixth place for about half 
the distance and then gradually 
pulled up on the leaders until on 
equal terms.with Quay. But the lat
ter was on the inside of the track 
and Dunny could not go around 
him on the final turn. The race was 
run in the exceptionally fast time of 
52 3-5 seconds. Haselton was cer
tainly missed in the distance events. 
Riser, however, ran his best race of 
the season when he finished second in 
the two-mile. In this run, Tech was

(ARM DEEE AS BETHANY
On Memorial Day Tech and Beth
any played a loose game which was 
witnessed by an unusually small 
number of rooters, most of whom 
seemed to have a special grudge 
against the visitors third baseman.
It is fortunate that a larger crowd 
was not in the stands, for the root
ing was anything but commendable. 
Ryan pitched a good game for 
Tech and kept his hits fairly well sepa
rated. Poor fielding sent in Beth
anys three runs. Harris pitched very 
well for the visitors; he struck out 
ten men, but was shaky in the tight 
places when the bases were full. 
Brine starred for Tech; his snappy 
work at short-stop was the feature 
of the game. He is credited with 
five assists and two putouts.
Bethany had but one man on base 
up to the fourth inning, but then be
gan to make things decidedly uncom
fortable for Ryan. Burgan and 
Rodgers were easy outs and then 
Haines hit a fast grounder along the 
left foul line for two bases. Horn 
then sent Harris home with a single 
and stole second while Lain was 
scrambling for the ball. Hagey then 
hit a liner over second base, but Mc
Donald succeeded in returning it from 
middle before Horn could score. 
Brown knocked a fast grounder to 
third baseman Krumm, who ac
cepted the chance and threw him 
out at first. This ended Bethanys 
scoring until the seventh inning when 
Tech did some fancy juggling with 
the ball and let in two runs. Horn 
was first man up and sent a snappy 
grounder to Brine, who made his 
first and only error by dropping the 
ball. Brown struck out. Smith 
doubled and while McDonald was 
playing solitaire out in middle Horn 
and Hagey brought in two runs. This 
ended Bethanys scoring.
Tech started out with real pep in 
the first and had the bases full. Hum
phries struck out. In the second 
period McDonald ran wild on the 
bases but lost his chance to score by 
trying to steal home at an ill-chosen 
moment. Techs first run came in 
the third. Kreider walked to first; 
Oeffinger hit a double to right field 
and Kreider crossed the plate, but 
was sent back to third by Umpire 
Haaren, who thought the ball had 
gone into the wire teasers. Harris 
took care of Brines bunt and De
Muth walked. The bases were then

A WORD OF APPRECIATION.
According to precedent, the elec
tion of The Tartan editor-in-chief for 
next year, marks the retirement from 
the board of the present senior mem
bers. Approaching, as we now are, 
the close of another school term, our 
tendency is one of retrospection. As 
we review the record achieved by 
The Tartan during the past nine 
months, we deem it a privilege to ut
ter a word of appreciation to those 
men whose efforts were responsible 
for the marked improvement in our 
weekly paper.
Fortunate indeed, was The Tartan 
in having at its head a man possessed 
of a personality and an individuality, 
a man who had his own convictions 
and who had the courage to state 
them. He was not infallible, nor did he 
claim to be, for he is human; yet he 
was always willing to listen to the 
other side of the question when it 
differed from the one he espoused. 
His influence will be a lasting one on 
the future policy of the paper and his 
example one that his successors will 
do well to follow.
No school publication is possible, 
however, unless it is conducted on a 
firm financial basis, so that in con
junction with the capable editing of 
The Tartan, its success may be attri
buted in a very large measure to its 
efficient business management. Since 
the day of his matriculation at Car
negie, the retiring business manager 
has been engaged in advertising work, 
not only for his paper but for other 
student enterprises as well. His ef
forts have resulted in the gradual in
crease in the usefulness of The Tar
tan as an advertising medium, accom
panied by a corresponding increase in 
its circulation, through which means 
the institution has become more wide
ly known. And at this time we wish
gratefully to acknowledge the debt 
of obligation we owe him for the in
valuable services he has rendered.
Three others, the M. M. C. S., the 
Science School and the Industry 
School editors, will also be lost by 
graduation. These members have 
served on the board but one year, yet, 
long enough to prove their worth and 
to merit the prediction that their 
places will be difficult to fill.
The retirement of five such mem
bers from its staff is the severest loss 
The Tartan has experienced in several 
years, a statement in itself an admis
sion of our high regard for their abil
ities. On bidding them good-bye, 
we want to express the hope that their 
future careers will be as successful as 
their administration of Tartan af
fairs has been.
THE HAMMER THROW.
It seems too bad that in the course 
of our earthly life, some one must 
suffer before an evil is remedied. The 
pages of history are covered with in
stances of human sufferings caused 
by disasters against which warning 
had been previously given or for 
which anecdotes had been previously 
suggested. Times have changed, but 
the nature of man has not. Even in so 
civilized an age as the present one, a 
serious accident must occur to arouse 
the people to action and to teach 
them a dearly-paid-for lesson.
Among the events included in inter
collegiate track meets the hammer 
throw is one that has invariably 
claimed its victims year after year. 
Although proposals for its abolish
ment have been suggested, no definite 
action has been taken concerning it. 
Recently, however, a serious injury to 
one of Carnegies best track athletes, 
inflicted by the hammer, brought the 
question home to us and therefore, 
regarding the elimination of a pos
sible source of harm, if only to few, 
of much greater importance than the 
continuation of a sport to amuse 
many, we deem it our duty to make 
a forceful appeal to our athletic as
sociation to exclude the hammer 
throwing contest from its future 
meets.
The argument will probably be ad
vanced that Carnegie can not do away 
with the event unless our competi
tors follow suit; that Carnegie then 
would be at a disadvantage to enter 
into competition with other colleges 
which included a hammer throwing 
^ontest. This leads us to our second 
proposal, namely, that the Carnegie 
athletic association exert its influence 
in the endeavor to persuade the other 
schools of Western Pennsylvania, at 
least, to abolish it. We believe 
enough pressure could be brought to 
bear on the colleges mentioned to 
make them agree with our point of 
view. There was no one who wit
nessed or heard of the mishap to 
Haselton, who did not feel sorry that 
it occurred and who did not express 
the wish that it might have been 
averted.
Our attitude may be briefly sum
marized in the words of Coach Dull 
who, immediately following the acci
dent, said, We can stand to lose the 
meet, but we cannot stand to be in
jured.
THE USE OF LATIN.
In a recent issue of The New York 
Times in answering its own ques
tion, Whats the use of Latin?, Calls 
attention to an exhibit prepared by 
the Wadleigh High School of that 
city. It is pointed out that those who 
visit the exhibit will see how Latin 
and Greek have become the vehicles 
of the English language and litera
ture. The Times says:
It will be easily seeen how tech
nical words used in the arts, sciences, 
and the professions may be grasped 
by those who have dug up and ex
amined these classical roots. It will 
bi seen how the literary works ot our 
language are shot through with al
lusions to the life of the peoples who 
spoke the older languages, and how 
profoundly their notions and ideas 
have worked into the texture of mod
ern life.
Now this article brings to mind a 
queer fault with our scheme of edu
cation at Carnegie. We believe that 
the importance of English, correctly 
spoken and written, has been greatly 
overlooked by the makers of our cur
riculum. English occupies the posi
tion of a minor study, whereas, it 
should decidedly be a major one. After 
graduation, in nine cases out of ten, it 
is the fellow that is able to write and 
converse correctly and intelligently 
that makes the success of life. This 
being the case, why not lay more em
phasis on our English course?
And if, as many educators assert, 
the student of English alone can 
never become an expert of the use of 
his language, Latin serves, perhaps 
better than any other language for 
his supplementary study. The theory 
that one must study at least two lan
guages inorder to obtain a critical 
knowledge on any language, is based 
on the assumption that one must 
have a basis of comparison. The 
value of Latin as affording such a 
basis is its accuracy. Latin moods, 
terms, declensions, numbers and gen
ders are so definitely indicated by the 
forms of the word that the student of 
language gets these elempntary prin
ciples firmly fixed in his mind. The 
great fault with modern languages is 
that they have lost much of their 
definiteness, while gaining in flexi
bility, and as a result the study of 
these languages alone may result in a 
distinct loss of knowledge and skill, 
not only in nicety and accuracy of 
speech, but even in correct expres
sion.
It is hoped the facuHy at Carnegie 
will carefully consider this question, 
and in order to facilitate the study 
and understanding of our own 
tongue, will, next year, insert into 
the schools curriculum a course in 
the greatest of all languages, Latin.

Under the efficinet management of 
Mr. Hollister and the zealous work 
of the directors, together with the 
enthusiastic co-operation of the mem
bers and those otherwise interested, 
this season has been a remarkable 
one in the history of the Carnegie 
Musical Clubs.
With all due respect to the resign
ing officers for 1913-14, it is hoped 
that the Musical Clubs of 1914-15 
will be everything that has brought 
credit to the Clubs in the past and 
add their share to the already well 
established renown of this branch of 
school activity.

PAN-AMERICANISTS HONOR 
PROF. WILLETT.
The Pan-American division of the 
American Association for Interna
tional Conciliation has recognized 
Pittsburgh in its selection of the 
countrys most prominent university 
men who are sailing from New York 
today for South America by naming 
Allan H. Willett, professor of econom
ics of the Carnegie Inst, of Techno
logy to be a member of the party that 
for the next four months will develop 
closer intellectual and cultural rela
tions between the citizens of the 
United States and other American re
publics.
Before they return next fall those 
men will have visited the capitals and 
other important centres of Brazil, 
Urguay, Argentina, Chile, Peru, Co
lombia, Panama and probably other 
countries. They will go with the 
view of spreading in the United 
States upon their return a wide? 
knowledge of the life and institutions 
of the American republics. These re
ports will be published and distri
buted broadcast.
Among the institutions represented 
in the party are the University of 
Illinois, University of Wisconsin, Co
lumbia University, Yale University 
and University of Chicago.
Prof. Willett is an authority on 
economic questions. He is the head 
of the department of commercial en~ 
gineering. He is a >ruwn graduate 
and was given his Ph.D. at Colum
bia in 1901. He taught economics at 
Brown from 1901 to 1905, and then 
came to Tech. In 1910 he was called 
to Washington to do some special 
economical invstigations in connec
tion with the decennial census which 
was taken under the direction of 
Commissioner Durand. He will re
turn to the United States in time for 
the Opening of the fall semester. 
The Post.
DEATH OF FORMER STUDENT
Morris F. Walsh, aged 21 years, a 
former student and star on the foot
ball team of the Carnegie Institute 
of Technology, died Wednesday, May 
27, on a train near Burlington, la., 
while on his way home from the west, 
where he had been recuperating from 
injuries received on the gridiron.
Young Walsh had spent two years 
in Colorado and was thought to be re
covering from his iilness. Recently 
his physician informed the youths 
father, James V. Walsh, a cooperage 
manufacturer of Knox and Summit 
streets, Knoxville, that he was be
coming homesick and that as he was 
practically well, it would be better 
for him' to come home. So he started 
from Denver, with a trained nurse. 
He died before he was half way home.
CHALLENGES EDISON ON 
CIGARETS .
(Editors Note:The following is 
an excerpt taken from an editorial 
which recently appeared in the Pitts
burgh Dispatch):
1 homas A. Edisons action in caus
ing to be posted at the Edison works 
in East Orange, N. J., notices reading 
Cigarets not tolerated; they dull the 
brain, and the attacks made by him 
and subscribed to by Henry Ford, the 
automobile man, against the use of 
cigarets, has led Percival S. Hill, 
president of the American Tobacco 
Company, to send a letter to Mr. 
Edison in defense of the cigaret and 
the cigaret smoker.
The scientific facts are all in favor 
of the cigaret, and no man can change 
these facts because he personally pre
fers a pipe to a cigar or a stogie or 
a chew of plug to the cigarets.
Mr. Hill said that the anti-cigaret 
agitation of a few years ago was such 
that medical ni'en and other scientists 
undertook examinations of the cigaret, 
which resulted in the same set of 
findings: That the cigaret is abso
lutely pure, that it contains less nico
tine than any other form of tobac
co products; that the combustion of 
the paper is harmless in its effect on 
the human physiology- and that its 
temperate use is in no way injurious 
to normal users.
Aside from the overwhelming 
weight of scientific testimony, said 
Mr. Hill, common sense alone will 
convince any reasonable man that the 
cigaret is not injurious. Inasmuch 
as ten to twelve million American 
men use cigarets, and perhaps even 
a larger percentage of educated Euro 
peans, your charge of feebleminded
ness lies against an overwhelming 
proportion of the commercial, profes
sional, artistic, musical and indus
trial world.
Mr. Hill gave figures showing that 
15,812,092,000 cigarets were made in 
the United States in 1913, against 
2,600,000,000 in 1900, an increase of 700 
per cent in 13 years.
If cigaret smoking is to be treated 
fairly, he continues, you must ad
mit that the subject is one that can 
be discussed only as a matter of per
sonal taste. You may or may not 
like cigarets. That is, of course, the 
right of any man. But it is hardly 
wise to use ones personal likes anu 
dislikes as a basis for uecmiing thai 
several million men are feebleminded 
especially when that sweeping in
dictment is directed against thous
ands of doctors, lawyers, college pro
fessors, ministers, business men and 
other leaders of thought and activity.

UNCLE SAMS HINTS HOW TO 
KEEP COOL.
Helpful Hints to Keep Cool dur
ing the hot wave were given by As
sistant Surgeon General Rucker, of 
the Public Health Service:
First of all, dont overeat, said 
Dr. Rucker. A furnace is not stok
ed in summer the way it is in winter. 
Partake sparingly of meats.
Eat largely of fresh vegetables 
and fruits.
Avoid alcoholic drinks. Alcohol 
never made anyone cooler.
Be sparing in the use of ice wa
ter. Drink plenty of water, but not
for caps at lowest prices
For style, quality and durability you can depend on any cap 
purchased here.
We carry only reliable goods and the prices are the lowest quoted 
anywhere.Boggs EC Buhl,Pittsburgh, Penna.

too cool, and have no ice in it.
In the matter of wearing apparel, 
Dr. Rucker advocated loose clothes 
of a light color and weight.
It is a significant fact, he said, 
that women are much more sensi
ble about clothes than men.
Keep in the air as much as possi
ble and in the shade, he continued. 
In the matter of sleeping, stay out 
of doors. Screen off the porch, if 
possible, and sleep in the open.
Cold baths are to be avoided, ac
cording to the Public Health Service 
physician. It is far better to bathe 
in lukewarm water in the summer 
than in cold water. Sponge baths 
are excellent for keeping cool, al
though tco many should not be taken.
HUGE SUN DIAL PRESENTED
COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY.
After several years of waiting, the 
Columbia sun dial was presented to 
Columbia University by the class of 
1885.
Nicholas Murray Butler, president 
of the university, acknowledged the 
addition to the campus.
The class of 1885 originally had 
planned to give to the university some 
fitting memorial, and a large granite 
ball on a handsome base was adopted.
The ball weighs fifteen tons. It 
casts a great oval shadow upon the 
base and from the moving edges the 
time is ascertained.
The dial has been made to indicate 
New York standard time.

iron and dirty cloth presses the grime

Carnegie Defeats Bethany
Continued from Page 1 
full with Laine, DeMuth, and Brine, 
all ready for a chance to score. 
Krumm hit an easy grounder to third 
baseman Rodgers, who lined the ball 
over to first, so that three men died on 
the bags.
The next four innings were very 
uneventual, for Tech and things be
gan to look blue, but the eighth 
changed the aspect of the game. Our 
boys found Harris for three doubles. 
Oeffinger started by sending a beauti
ful drive into the base of the cliff in 
middle. Brine sent a long fly to mid
dle where it was dropped by Radcliffe. DeMuth hit a perfect sacrifice 
bunt, sending Brine and Oeffinger to 
second and third. Lain then drove a 
red-hot grounder down the ally be
tween short-stop and second, and 
Oeffinger and Brine scored.
Humphries hit another double and 
Lain came in from second. Krumm 
and Fulmer, who took McDonalds 
place in the seventh, were easy outs. 
The final score was A3, Tech.

MHO CLUB RECEPTION.
The annual Mho Club Reception 
for Plebes electing the Electrical 
Engineering course took place on 
Tuesday evening, May 26, in the main 
club room, Science. About fifty were 
there, including the half of the next 
year Soph. Electricals who were 
present. Twenty-six Plebes have cho
sen the electrical course.
Professors Dennison and Work 
were there, and the former gave a 
short talk outlining the purpose of 
the Mho Club as being to promote 
interest in current engineering topics 
and to further sociability among the 
electricals of the different classes. 
Professor W'ork also spoke, particu
larly of the benefits arising from1 
membership in the club; but he will 
be remembered longer for the sleight 
of hand card tricks he performed.
Einstein and Ettele assisting the 
man at the piano with a fiddle. Good 
fellowship reigned and the satisfied 
feeling with which everybody left 
proved the efficiency of A. D. 
Moore, the chairman of the commit
tee for the reception.
HASELTON IMPROVING.
The latest report about Haselton 
indicates that his condition is im
proving. His leg was to have been 
set finally on Tuesday and after that, 
little hindrance to the knitting of the 
broken bone is anticipated.

again beaten out just at the tape. Handelman placed a second time during 
the afternoon by taking fourth. With 
more experience his outlook for the 
future is very bright. MacMillan was 
not feeling well at the time and was 
unable to do better than fifth in the 
half-mile. The relay team1 consisted 
of the same men that ran in the Pitt 
meet a week previous. Finlay, Pat
terson, Meredith and Dunseith, run
ning in the,order named, were second 
only to Pitt.
Besides the first places ane^dy men
tioned in the pole vault and high 
jump, Kirk was fourth in the former, 
while Wright tied with Sheehan of 
Pitt for third in the latter. Clair did 
not have his own weight with him; 
nevertheless he took second in both 
the hammer and discus throws. 
Adams improved greatly in the discus 
sending it over 104 feet for fourth 
place and he scored another point in 
the shot put.

baseball team received their second 
defeat of the season. The victors 
were the Pitt Freshmen, who 
walked away with an easy victory by 
the score of 8-6.
From the spectators standpoint, 
the game was listless and unexciting. 
The Plebes did not play up to their 
usual form, displaying very little snap 
and real baseball ability. Their field
ing was exceptionally poor. A wild 
heave by Doherty, at short stop, let 
in three runs. It was this throw 
which really lost the game, for the 
Plebes. The Pitt team ran wild on 
the bases, purloining them with ease.
On account of the poor showing of 
the team, Manager Darwin A. Curtis 
has cancelled the games which re
main on the schedule. He attributes 
the poor showing of the team to the 
fact that his men, in getting prepared 
for the final examinations, have been 
able to do very little consistent prac
tice during the past week.

COLLEGE ROWDYISM.
An unfortunate affair at St. Johns 
College, which yet may result in a 
fatality, illustrates both the danger 
and the difficulty which may grow 
out of that form of college rowdyism 
euphemistically called hazing.
Five young men, it seems, had 
locked themselves in the room of one 
of their number to avoid contact with 
a number of older classmen who, ac
cording to the statements attributed 
to the freshmen, intended not only 
to haze them, but to beat them up. 
If superficial appearances are to be 
trusted, the would-be hazers attempt
ed to break into the room by force, 
and either in anger or in panic one 
of the besieged freshmen shot through 
the door, inflicting a dangerous wound 
upon one of the besiegers.
If it be true, as alleged by students, 
that a reign of terror has existed at 
St. Johns since the collegiate term 
began, as a result of hazing and 
threats of worse treatment for peach
ing, it is by no means surprising that 
the young men in the room believed 
that they were in genuine peril if the 
attack upon the door was to be suc
cessful. Suspension, not dismissal, 
has been the penalty for hazing at 
the college, according to news re
ports, and the effect has not been by 
any means deterent. The allegation 
of a reign of terror seems to be sup
ported by the fact that the accused 
young men refuse to be frank, even 
when confronted with the legal au
thorities of the county.
Hazing is an unmanly, 
useless practice, intended 
to humiliate the new man. 
neither reason nor excuse for it. That 
it injures the college is testified to 
by the statement that the Freshman 
class has been falling off in number 
at St. Johns.Baltimore Star.

CLASSIFIED LIST OF TARTAN ADVERTISERS
We have classified our advertisers so that our readers may use the list 
for reference before making purchases. The grouping furnishes an excellent 
variety of merchants for any article which a student, alumnus or faculty 
member would be likely to buy, and there is no valid reason of which we are 
aware that would justify anyone interested in the welfare of The Tartan in 
making purchases from any but merchants who so kindly make such a publi
cation possible. Be sure, also, to give one of the purchase stubs, which you 
will find enclosed in your Tartan every other week, to the clerk from whom 
you make the purchase. The stubs, we have found, make pleased advertisers 
and help to get new ones. May we depend upon YOU to take this as a re
sponsibility to your Institution and to The Tartan.
