|F00T BALL ASSUREDMONEY COLLECTED AT LAST.
The managers of foot-ball affairs for the first time 
since the close of the past season, are now assured 
of the possibility of funds for carrying on the sport 
next year. For months it has been in jeopardy. 
Ever since the adoption of the cash plan for oper
ating the affairs of the Athletic Association the 
problem of raising the money to cover the guaran
tees of games has been looming up.
The campaign was ended with a whirlwind finish 
Thursday and Friday. At the meeting of the Board 
of Control Wednesday night, the problem was once 
more brought up and Manager Scott made it plain 
that the shortage would have to disappear before 
midnight Friday or he would be forced to cancel the 
entire schedule he had arranged. Dr. Savage made 
a strong appeal to do something so as to decide the 
matter either way once and for all, and was asked 
to assist in addressing various classes and clubs 
with the hope of accumulating the difference and 
bridging the gap. Upon his hearty acceptance, plans 
for operating the headquarters Friday night, and a 
schedule of the gatherings to be met were hurriedly 
formulated. The notices upon the bulletin boards 
were kept up to date with the changes in the 
amounts contributed by each 'Class plainly marked.
The good news that the required sum had been
.paid in was learned Friday evening before it was 
time to stop receiving donations. Following is a list 
of classes, number of students in classes and 
amount raised:

HOCKEY
Owing to lack of practice, and being unfamiliar 
with the ring, Tech played far below its form against 
Case, but even then they had no trouble winning, 5 
to 2. The first half ended 2 to 1 in Techs favor, 
but in the second half Tech recovered and caged 
three more goals, while Case was able to only slide 
one past Minnemeyer.
The Tech hockey team journed to Cleveland last 
Friday, where Case was met that night, and Western 
Reserve Saturday night.

NoteSee Saturdays Gazette for complete lineup.
Saturday evening, the Tech team recovered their 
mid-season form, and swamped Western Reserve. As 
Reserve had beaten Case, and Case had held Tech to 
a low score, the Clevelanders all expected Reserve to 
hand the Skibos a good trouncing.
The Techites looked like pigmies when stacked 
against Reserve; their team being made up of foot

---------------------------------------------------

ball players, the most notable being Muff Portman, 
who is remembered by all Tech students who saw 
the football game last fall.
When the final count had been made, it showed 
that the Pittburghers had counted nine times, while 
Reserve was lucky to get one shot at the Plaid goal. 
While Minnemeyer had but one stop, Ellis, Reserves 
goal tender, had stopped nineteen drives that looked 
like sure goal.
Techs nine points where evenly divided among 
Bright, Mason and Charles. Much praise is due Capt. 
Dornberger and Stevenson, as their defense was prac
tically impregnable.

Cast Selection Well On.
Two try-outs for positions on the cast of this year's 
show bave been held and the showing so far is a 
good one for so early in the game. The females 
of the cast will certainly be of the highest order of 
grace and beauty. From the looks of things, the low 
. comedy parts will be in better hands than ever be
fore. The selection of a leading man will be a more 
difficult problem. Already, the costumes for both 
cast and chorus are being made, and will eclipse all 
attempted before.
Among the new and startling stunts to be perform
ed by the chorus will be a harlequanade, an out door 
circus of hoop jumping and rope skipping by the men 
as clowns, and the girls as ballet dancers.
The manuscript of the paly is all out, and proves 
the lines to be those of a whirlwind farce, brim full 
of action with something doing all the time There is 
no doubt but that it in every way surpasses that of 
last year. Musical Director Dorrington has the ma
jority of the songs picked and the glee chorus much 
larger than that of last year, will begin rehearsing 
with him within a short time.
The production this year is the boldest attempt yet 
made. There is a better book, more people are in 
the cast and choruses, and stage appointments and ac
cessories will be more elaborate.
The date for the appearance in Youngstown, Ohio, 
is April 24th.
PENNSYLVANIAS RELAY RACES TO BE BET
TER THAN EVER.
Pennsylvanias Relay Races promise to be better 
than ever this year. Already many of the big col
leges have been heard from, and when the pistol 
starts the first-class race on April 30th, it is alto
gether likely that there will be hardly an absentee 
from either the east or west. Reports of prepara
tion for this meet come from all quarters, so that, 
as for several years past, it will be most representa
tive. The college championship races will bring to
gether the very best runners in the entire American 
college world, while the special events will give the 
field men, the sprinters and the hurdlers a chance to 
prove their worth when pitted against the very best 
men of the country, both from the east and the west. 
Last year over 200 teams were on hand, and even a
larger number will be seen on Franklin Field on the 
last Saturday in April. More colleges will be there 
than will be found at any other two meets, while the 
same can also be said of the school teams. This is 
due to the fact that but four men are necessary for 
a team, and even at schools and colleges that have 
but little money to spend on track sport, it is often 
feasible to send a team to these great sports. In 
many places the runners are sent through popular 
subscription throughout the institution.
For several years some one or other worlds record 
has been made at the Relays, and with such highclass athletics as will compete in the college events, 
it is very probable that old Father Time will have to 
move up a peg higher, or the existing marks in the 
field events be placed at a more astounding figure 
than they are at present. Ifr'is because of the very 
high-class work seen in the big college races that 
the Relays are proving an annual object lesson in 
athletics for many of the minor college teams and 
for all the school teams. This has resulted in a 
gradual bettering of the standard all along the line, 
so that better time is now being made, both by the 
schools and colleges, in all the class races. Such a 
high standard _is being maintained that this country 
can produce at any time more first-class quartermilers than all the other countries of the world put 
together. ;Such is the calibre of the teams that visit. 
Franklin Field, and each college and school should 
make an effort to be represented.
ALUMNAE TEA.
The Alumnae Association of the Margaret Morri
son Carnegie School for Women held a reunion Sat
urday afternoon, February 26th, at the home of Miss 
Henrietta Alcorn. This is the first time the Class of 
09 has been together since its graduation last June 
and the afternoon was thoroughly enjoyed by all. 
Most of the girls living in or near town were present, 
and many notes of greeting were received from those 
in distant cities. The members of the Faculty were 
guests of the Association. This gave the graduates 
doing to strengtnen and increase their feeling of kinan opportunity to meet the new instructors and in so 
ship and loyalty to their Alma Mater.
Miss Alcorn was assisted by the officers of the As
sociation. Miss Nancy Herron and Miss Catherine 
Ihmsen poured tea. Those girls who have joined

the noble army of bread winners were prone to talk 
shop while those who belong to the leisure class 
gossiped various things of interest to women. Any 
way, everybody had a good time and left, hoping for a 
chance to do it again soon.
The Association was organized last June with the 
following officers:
President...................................................Elizabeth E. Sheets
Vice President........................................Henrietta K. Alcorn
Secretary............................................................Edna C. Smith
Treasurer........................................................Anna M. Donehoo
RepresentativesHattie G. Merrill, Ada B. Ramlack, 
Dorothy B. Scott.
These officers constitute the executive committee. 
The annual business meeting is to be held during 
Commoncement week, at which time the graduating 
class will be received into membership. Work for the 
coming year is being planned and the Association 
hopes to prove before long that it is not dead though 
it may seem to be sleeping.
Miss Josephine Mandeville was entertained 011 
Monday night by a surprise party given in honor of 
her birthday.
Here is a fact worth knowing and remembering: 
In New Orleans there is an odd statue probably the 
only one of its kind in the Country, which was erected 
in memory of a woman. Only one word, Margaret, is 
inscribed underneath, and proves, more than any
thing else, that the woman did something to make 
herself loved. Margaret was a poor, obscure woman, 
who did baking for her living, and ^s time went on 
she prospered enough to help others less fortunate 
than herself. During the time New Orleans was in 
great trouble and distress, Margaret baked bread and 
gave it to all the children in the city who needed it. 
For so ministering to the helpless and starving, a 
beautiful monument has been erected in front of the 
Orphan Asylum.
Miss Lyon (in laundry)Soap manufactures put 
out soap shavings also.
Miss Miller (aside)Did she say. shaving soap?
Miss AndersonThere was a battle between the 
Frolic and the Wasp, and the Frolic got stung.
SOPHOMORE DOPE.
The members and friends of the Sophomore Civil 
Sporting Club witnessed two good bouts last week 
in the rooms of the club. The main vent was a 10- 
round bout between Rex the Rochester Mosquito 
(the pest), and Koerbel the East End Whirlwind. 
As a preliminary to the big mill there was a battle 
between Phillips, the Castle Shannon Wonder, and 
Shenfelt, the Pitcairn Demon. The Demon start
ed out well, but by the end of the second round, 
Phillips was landing on him at will. At the end of 
the fourth round Shenfelts second threw up the
sponge much to the disappointment of the spectators 
who expected a knockout in the fifth.
The main bout was for blood from the start and 
referee D. B. Wagner had a hard time protecting him
self when breaking clinches. This fight went the 
full 10 rounds when the decision was given to the 
Mosquito, as he had landed about two blows to 
every one received. The winner of the mill was 
challenged by Jack, the Ambridge Pug but some 
disagreement in the management makes things look 
as though the fight would never come off.
It is remarkable to note how a simple common
place illustration will make a difficult mathmatical 
problem perfectly simple. For instance:
Mr. S.Just imagine, gentlemen, that the figure 
on the board is a doughnut without a hole in it. Such 
a doughnut would be & very remarkable doughnut, of 
course.
I admit if you used a little brute force and punch
ed a hole in the doughnut it would be a doughnut, 
but just imagine for the differential of a moment that 
this figure on the board is a doughnut without a 
hole in it and the problem will become perfectly 
simple. 
Another instance:
Mr. K. (in Spherical Trignomtry)Just imagine 
the figure on the board to be a tumor.
Prof. in MaterialsNow to recall a principle of 
mechanics which you have not had yet.
NOTICESTUDENTS LIST FOR CATALOGUE.
There will be posted this week on the bulletin 
boards of the four schools proof sheets of the stu
dents list for the coming catalogue. Each student is 
requested to examine these proofs and if an error or 
omission occurs in connection with his name to re
port it at once to the Deans office.
A. W. Tarbell, Registrar.
CRAFTSMANS CLUB.
The members of the Craftsmans Club held an in
teresting meeting in the club rooms of the A. & J. 
building last Friday night. A large percentage of 
the membership of the Club was present and con
siderable business was transacted. Following the 
wishes of a number of the men, a committee was 
appointed for the purpose of arranging the details 
of a dance to be given early in April. Mr. Smith of 
the Athletic Association was present and urged the 
necessity of making contributions to the Association.
We take it all backIT will be on April 4, not 
April 5.
Prof. Crabtree spoke before the American Institute 
of Mining Engineers last week on the work and aims 
of Carnegie Tech, with special reference to the 
courses in Mining and Metallurgical Engineering. 
Brof. Wadsworth covered the same topic in refer
ence to the University of Pittsburgh.

EDITORIAL
NEWSPAPER HYSTERIA.
HYSTERIAA nervous affection, in which the 
patient loses control over the emotions, becoming the 
victim of imaginary sensations.Webster.
The definition fits the complaint.. Had the im
mortal and learned N. Webster inserted the word 
common before nervous in the foregoing, it 
would have been more concise with regard to the 
present attack. Comment touching upon certain hap
penings within our Schools has been made on front 
pages, in editorial columns and in the squibs of Pitts
burgh newspapers during the week past. The writer 
of the leading editorial in last Sundays Pittsburgh 
Dispatch states that The newspapers report an
other outbreak of undergraduate humor at the Car
negie Technical Schools which managed to include 
the following acts forbidden by the criminal law, viz: 
Kidnapping, false imprisonment, riot and assault and 
battery. These are the mere incidents of that stand
ard of courtesy which finds pleasure in the attempt 
of one class to interfere with and spoil a -social 
gathering of another class.
Now, Mr. Editor, if you will pay attention, please 
note the following errors in your newspaper re
ports.. The affair mentioned did not take place be
tween the Sophomore and Plebe classes.. It was of 
such small conquence that all the attention it at
tracted here at Tech was small compared to that 
commonly attending a good health dog-fight or a run
away. It may have disturbed a few elderly and 
permanently unmarried ladies who chanced to be in 
the range of the noise. There was no riot and no 
assault and battery.. There might have been the 
next day had one of the authors of your newspaper 
reports appeared on the scene and revealed his 
identity.
Still, Mr. Editor, we know just how you felt about 
it. There are often times when we are driven to 
selecting almost anthing to serve as the subject of 
an editorial.
FUTURE NUMBERS.
We take pleasure in announcing the early appear
ance of The Hook-worm Number of The Tartan. 
The major portion of the contents will be devoted 
to odes, to laziness, spring-fever, and the Worm Him
self. The date will be determined by the weather.
Founders Number will be gotten out by Monday, 
May second. Here, we propose to make our grand 
splurge of the year. Plans are under way to make it 
a souvenir of that occasion, and to raise the tax to 
ten cents for that number to cover the increased cost 
of its preparation. We have some startling and 
unique stunts up our selves for it. President Taft 
is scheduled to attend the Founders exercises, which 
fact will furnish much interesting copy.
The White Friars Number will make its appear
ance about the time of the show, and we hope to do 
the job up in fine style.
The Gossip Number will contain daring truths 
about the faculty and executive force of the Schools. 
It will probable be the last number of the year, so as 
to give the editor a chance to journey to a place within 
easy walking distance of the Canadian conserved 
primeval before its appearance.
CLASS ATHLETICS AND NEWSPAPERS.
By reason of the fact that there has been so much 
untrue and shipshod newspaper reporting done re
cently in connection with some class and student 
teams playing basket ball and other winter sports, 
we have to advise some means of preventing a repeti
tion of the damage done the good name of Carnegie 
Tech. Past experience had proved the utter futility 
of any appeal to newspaper reason or fairness. The 
trouble often lies with the reporter and makes it im
possible for the sporting editor to run down the false 
source of the story if he be so inclined. We have, 
therefore, to go at the problem in another way.
We need class and student teams; need them badly 
as a means of developing material for the varsity. At 
the same time it will not do for any more headlines 
to be appearing in the dailies to the effect that Tech 
was smeared by Prep or walloped by High School. 
In our opinion, it is a task for the Board of Control 
of the Athletic Association.
There is a rumor afloat to the effect that the 
Junior Class in Civil Engineering will walk out in 
sympathy with the striking union men of Philadel
phia.

GLEE CLUB NOTICE.
There will be a rehearsal of both clubs on Sunday, 
March 13th, at 2:30 to prepare for a concert to be 
given at the Allegheny County Hospital on the 19th 
of March. All members attending rehearsals and this 
concert will be given a four dollar pass to their 
charity ball which will be held some time in April.
Mr. McClintock, a Princeton man, will take charge 
of the Glee Club next Sunday and if enough interest 
is shown by the members it will be for the remainder 
of the season. This will be decided next Sunday by 
the attendance at rehearsal. If there are not enough 
men present to assure the new director that suf
ficient interest is alive, the club will disband for the 
rest of this year and all concerts that are booked will 
be canceled. Preparations are under way for con
certs to be given in Altoona, Homestead, Knoxville, 
Duqeusene, Allegheny and also a joint concert with 
the Glee Club of the girls school. Come out Sunday 
and show the new director and manager that you are 
ready for work.
ESPERANTO SOCIETY OF C. T. S.

subjects given in the Schools during April. They 
will be for the student body and the general public. 
The lecturers will be Dr. Brashear, Prof. Keller, Prof. 
Gibbs, Prof. James and Prof. Mott. Each will choose 
a subject along the lines of the speakers specializa
tion. Dates and details are to be announced later.
SECOND YEAR INDUSTRIALS.
The Tech Mechanics Club enjoyed a trip to the 
Homestead Steel Mills last Wednesday and a visit 
to the Union Switch & Signal Companys works at 
Swissvale Saturday. These trips are very interest
ing and instructive and it is hoped more of the mem
bers will go on the next which will be in the near 
future.
Class arguments are not the only incidents in 
these strenuous timesfor instanceThe Slaughter 
of the Innocent by Mr. Morris in his Geometry test.
Mr. Day (to Kurz, coming in late)Didnt your 
alarm go off this morning?
KurzYes, but it was so foggy, I was afraid to 
walk fast for fear I would run over some one.
Mr. Peters (in English)Every sentence should 
begin with a period.
EsherEvery proper name should end with a 
comma.
Mr. MorrisWe compute the interest at 360 mo. 
to the year.
It seems that the Industrials are the only live ones 
in the Aero Club, as is evidencel by some of them 
building a glider.
StudentDoes the rain water have any effect on 
a magnet?
Mr. CalderwoodYes, it wets it.
Mr. Leighou has the little finger of his left hand 
so developed in sense of touch that he can tell the 
adhesive powers of imaginary glues.
Mr. CalderwoodCan you make a permanent 
magnet of soft iron?
StudentYes, but it wont be permanent.
A Plebe recently asked to be excused from the fil
ing exercise in Machine Shop, because he was lefthanded, and a First Year man doesnt think the shop 
has a full equipment, for they have no left hand 
monkey wrenches on hand. Mr. Whyte told him they 
had none in the tool room.
FIRST YEAR INDUSTRIALS.
What we understand was a successful banquet was 
held last Friday night at the Fort Pitt Hotel by the 
first year A. & J. class.
