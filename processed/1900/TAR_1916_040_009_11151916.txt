Four Men Have a
Chance for Captaincy

Are Eligible for Football 
Captain Next Year
THE ELECTION COMES SOON! :-: .

NOTICE
This year there are Tour men on 
the football team that have good 
chances of being elected captain for 
next year. These men are Marshall,
Finlay, Kelly and I McFeaters. Mar
shall has played three years on the 
team, as has also Kelly. McFeaters 
and Finlay have only played two 
years. Next year, however, Finlay 
will be an upper man in Industries.
All these men have shown great 
ability on the football field, and no 
matter how the election goes, the 
student body may feel sure that the 
man elected will strive to make next 
years team as good as any that have 
worn the Plaid of Carnegie.
A short account of each man fol
lows in this article:
Phil Marshall.
Phil Marshall, our never-say-die 
left halfback, is a product of PeaTjody. High, where he won fame at 
football, basketball and on the track 
teams, the latter two of which he 
was captain. It may be said of Mar
shall that once he gets the ball in 
his hands he never stops running 
until his body is simply smothered. 
Phil is very elusive to tackles. While 
most players do poorly on a wet 
field, he is a regular mud-horse. His 
iron constitution stands up well un
der the gaff of a hard game.

George E. Finlay, Industry 18, 
drifted in from Boston a couple of 
years ago to be a printer. He claims 
Williston Academy as his prep

A meeting o the night Soience 
men was called on Monday evening 
of last week to elect representatives 
to the various organizations. Con
sidering the necessarily late hour, the 
large number who put in an appear
ance bodes well for the interest be
ing taken in the school affairs.  How
ever, perhaps the smokes and eats, 
not to mention drinks, had some
thing to do with the large turnout. 
The attractions mentioned were not, 
however, conducive to expeditious 
dispatch of the business.
A. C. Bennett, president of the 
Fifth Year class, conducted the 
meeting, and the following men were 
elected to hold office: Student Ac

A letter has been received by Di
rector Hamerschlag from Mr. S. H. 
Church, president of the Board of 
Trustees, in which he expresses his 
appreciation of the part the Tech stu
dents took in the Centennial parade. 
It reads as follows:
/' November 6, 1916. 
Dr.. A. A. Hamershlag, Director, 
Carnegie Institute of Technology, 
Pittsburgh, Pa.
Dear Mr. Hamerschlag:
I was very much interested in the 
great civic parade last Friday which 
marked Pittsburghs one hundred 
years of corporate life, and I have 
no hesitation in saying that among 
all the interesting and attractive or
ganizations which took part, the 
group which comprised the students 
from our Technical schools was by 
far the most noteworthy. Our boys 
and girls had evidently thought the 
matter out for themselves from an 
artistic point of view, and their strik
ing costumes and the freedom and 
high spirit of their marching, made 
them the most picturesque and at
tractive group In the entire proces
sion. It is really an admirable thing 
for them to display their initiative 
and talent on these great occasions 
in the civic life of the community.
Sincerely yours,
(S) S. H. CHURCH, 
President.
RADIO STATION HEARS 
ELECTION RETURNS
We rapidly grow older on the field 
of. battle.Napoleon.
Receiving and sending returns from 
the most exciting presidential elec
tion in the history of the country by 
wireless telegraphy was the experi
ence enjoyed by members of the 
Radio club of the Carnegie Institute 
of Technology last week. The Tech 
radio station has a sending radius of 
two hundred miles and Is able to 
pick up messages from along the At
lantic coast and as far west as Chi
cago. The ears of the student oper
ators were filled therefore from nine 
^clock election night to two the next 
morning with a continuous buzz and 
blur of wave words which were beblur of wave words which were be
ing sent out through the air from 
hundreds of stations in this part of 
the country.
The Tech radio plant is located in 
a faraway room up in the tower of 
Machinery Hall, where everything is 
quiet and removed from the disturb
ance of the campus. The little room 
on the night of the election was filled 
with members of the club, but while, 
the business of receiving and sending 
the news was being performed not 
a sound was to be heard save the 
click in the operators transmitter

LECTURE ON CHINA BY 
U. S. BUSINESS ATTACHE
Dr. Julian Arnold, United States 
commercial attache to China and 
Japan, spoke in Industries assembly 
last Wednesday. He talked about 
China, its wealth of undeveloped re
sources, such as coal and iron. He 
said he believed the day was not 
far off when the Pacific ocean will 
be the worlds greatest commercial 
area.
His lecture was illustrated with 
lantern slides, showing the Chinese 
waterways, life in cities, methods of 
transportation, methods of irrigation, 
manufacturing of sugar and paper, 
silk weaving, rug making, pottery, 
tea fields, cnmphor trees, modes of 
living, schools, recreation, printing, 
walled cities, temples and marriage 
customs.
Dr. Arnold spoke rapidly, saying 
as much In an hour as most lectur
ers can say in two, He kept his 
audience interested during his ontire lecture in spite of the fact that 
most ot the men were sleepy after 
having been up all night watching 
election returns.
DRY FIELD IS HOPED FOR
November ISth is the biggest Sat
urday of Techs football season. It 
is then that the Plaid eleven meets 
the mighty Pitt team, their bitter 
rivals of the hill. Only once since 
football has been played between Pitt 
and Tech has a Carnegie eleven 
scored on Pitt. This year the blfie 
and gold eleven is the best that'ever 
represented the university; also this 
year the Plaid eleven is one of tho 
best, if not the very best team in 
the history of the school. The Plaid 
warriors will liavo the host chance 
in their career to score on their pow
erful opponents.
The great Pitt machine, coached 
by tho famous. Glen Warner, is ac
knowledged the champions of the 
country. Tho Warnor machine .is a 
team composed of stars, but they 
blend together to form a unit. There 
are Hastings, Peck and Horron, last 
years All-American men, but capping 
them all Is the foxy Glen Warnor, 
former Carlisle Indian coach. Tho 
true power of Pitt lays in her substi
tutes, or rather her varsity, for Pitt 
has no substitutes. It has often boon 
said there are two full teams and 
eight men on a third toam. They 
aro all so good that It makos no dif
ference which one plays. Of courso 
there aro eleven mon who havo a

OUR BOARD WALKS.
On the campus the other day some
one suggested that the boardwalks 
should bo replaced. Apparently this 
was a good suggestion, but we wish 
to call attention to a feature of the 
quostlon which has been forgotten. 
The boardwalks have become a part 
of our institution, almost a tradition, 
nnd it would bo almost a crime to 
remove thom at this late dato. It 
would bo certain to bring forth n 
roar of protest f.rom alumni all over 
the country. Time brings changes

would bo unjust to returning alumni,

The scholarship dance Is always a 
great success f.rom the financial us 
well as tho enjoyment standpoint, so 
a large attendance is expected and 
arrangements have been made ac
cordingly.
The proceeds of the dance will go 
to swell the fund already raised by 
the Design school girls for tho sup
port of scholarship funds. The pro
ject has the heartiest approval and 
active support of all the faculty.
Instead of the Design school cor
ridors as last year, the dance will be

MOVIES OF YALE-TECH GAME
The annual football smoker will 
be held in Carnegie Union, Central

game the students, faculty and alum
ni gather together and renew old ac
quaintances as well as make many

Movies of the Yale-Tech game at 
New Haven will be shown, followed

Coach Steffen] leaves immediately 
after the smoker for Chicago. This 
fact is enough to make every man 
in Tech come out and see their foot
ball "guardian for the last time this 
season. Every man must not only 
see that he goes himself but bring 
along every other Tech man he is 
acquainted with. The proceeds, if 
any, of the smoker, will be turned 
over to the athletic association.
ENGINEERS OF SIGMA NU 
HOLD HOUSE DANCE
While the Architects were on charette, the Engineers of Sigma Nu held 
a most delightful dance at their 
house on Forbes street, Friday even
ing, November 10. About fifteen cou
ples were present and dancing was 
enjoyed until a late hour, the music 
being supplied by V. I. Riehl. Punch 
and cakes were served throughout 
the evening. Of course, the Archi

was done, and, being architects, were 
not too tired to dance.

Plans Discussed
Last Friday night was a nlglit of 
nights for more than sixty members 
of the Carnegie New England Club. 
Students, faculty and alumni members 
wore all present at tho Gorman Club, 
executive oflleors were elected, and 
club house plans wore discussed, be
fore tho sumptuous banquet was serv
ed in tho (lining hall,
ChOBWlclc, Touns, and Wadsworth, 
tho banquet committeemen, deserve 
tho credit for arranging in detail this 
most important Now England meet
ing.
At 8:110 sharp .Mr. Tumpano, alum
nus, opened the mooting of reviewing 
the clubs activities to the present 
time, and forecasting tho prospects 
for tho new year. Nominations for 
Officers were then in order. The elec
tion resulted in John Touns, presi
dent; M. Hiller, vice president; M. 
Wadsworth, secretary, and H. Cliesick, treasurer. These men will de
vote their energies to constant pro
motion of New England club activi
ties, and they were elected because 
of their peculiar abilities along these 
lines. As required by the constitution 
an Executive Committee was elected. 
T. Finlay M. Gliadstein and E. Kelly 
receiving the majority of votes. Plans 
for a N. E. .Clubhouse were discussed 
at length by M. Tumpane and Dr. Har 
ris. The idea of a house appealed to 
everyone and it was decided by a un
animous vote that the president 
choose a committee of three men to 
investigate conditions, which would 
give the club members more exact in
formation. Just before the close of 
the business meeting, Director Ham
erschlag appeared and hastened the 
men down stairs, where covers were 
laid for everyone. There was not. a 
dull moment after that. Between 
courses, Gaylords Quartet sang, fa
culty members made addressos, and 
tho wonder student magician, Gladstoln, deceived the flvo senses of 
ovory-ono presont by his elovor tricks.
Director Hamorschlag gave a 
splendid address in which ho reviewed 
Now England Club history. He ad* 
vooatod a Carnegie N. E. Club unit, 
but urged broad cultivation and 
sproading of tho true Carnegie spirit 
of work and progress, which is re
sponsible for tho presont high stand
ard of scholarship in the institution. 
Mr. Tarbell narrated the rise of N. E. 
Club activities since the days of Bill 
Foster. This address of the regis
trar was particularly interesting, be
cause of his personal relations as re
gistrar with N. E. men. Dr. Harris 
was. enthusiastic in his support of a 
club house and his remarks will serve 
as valuable suggestions to the com
mittee detailed to. investigate house 
plans.
Late in the evening Professor Thay
er and Mr. Simmons came in, and 
thus increased the total attendance 
to sixty. There was not an idle mo
ment till twelve oclock, when toast
master Touns suggested that the ban
quet be brought to a close.
CROSS 
HELD LAST WEDNESDAY
Captain Dunseith Led His 
Team Over the Entire 
CourseNew Men Look 
Promising
Last Wednesday the cross-country 
team, which has been working hard 
all fall, had their tryouts. The run 
was taken on the regular course of 
five miles over the ups and downs of 
Schenley park. A crowd of spec
tators gathered at the gym to watch 
the finish, while many others were 
strung along the course to observe 
the men in their usual stride.
Captain Dunsieth was at his best 
all through the run and easily led 
the others by a big lead; His time 
over the course was 30 minutes and 
36 seconds.
Lawson, one of last years men, 
was second, showing form which bids 
fair for greater things before the sea
son closes.
Benter followed closely in third 
place with Miller and Andrews com
ing in soon after. Miller is  prom
ising lad from Westinghouse high 
school, and promises to rival the 
best in his career atl Tech.
Schmidt crossed the line fifth, 
while Howe completed the team by 
coming in seventh.
Of these seven, the first five were 
picked to represent Carnegie Tech 
at Penn State last Saturday. Al
though they did not come in among 
the first in the tryouts there were 
several new men who showed up 
very well last Wednesday. Of. these 
Kossler, Baird, Goldman and Clark 
are worthy of especial note. These 
men came in in the order named.
THISTLE BOXES PLACED.
Boxes have been placed in the four 
schools for the collection- of snap
shots, verses, cartoons and in general 
anything that is of interest to the 
students. With these suggestions, and 
not without them, the Thistle can jbe 
made to depict real student life as it 
is here at Tech. It is therefore up to 
the students to contribute their ideas 
freely and largo return is expected, 
Tho sales campaign will be started 
vory soon now and all students who 
wish to act; as agents should report 
thoir names to ttyo following: R. T. 
Soule, Science; Helen Seim, M. M. C. 
S., W. D. Green, Industries, and F. C. 
McConnoll or L, C. Smith, Design. The 
former plan of allowing one free book 
to an agent selling twenty will be con
tinued tills year. At least one agent 
Is wanted In each section and there
fore all who want to act on this offer 
are urged to report at once.
H. W. LAIDLER LECTURES 
ON SOCIALISM AND WAR
Mr. H. W. Laidler of New York, 
will give a lecture to students and 
faculty on "Socialism and War.. Mr. 
Laidler is coming here under the 
auspices of the C. I. T. Economic 
society. His discussion will be of 
interest to every student, especially 
at this time of war and social un
rest. In 1905 Mr. Laidler organized 
the Intercollegiate Socialist Society, 
which now has local chapters in the 
seventy leading American colleges 
and universities, and which is now 
assuming noticeable importance in 
providing opportunity for the academ
ic study of socialism. The C. I. T. 
Economic Society, whose object it is 
to afford opportunity for the discus
sion of modern economics and social 
problems, takes pleasure in bringing 
before the student body, a man of 
recognized ability in his field. Yale, 
Harvard and Pennsylvania are, on 
the list, and we deem it fortunate to 
have secured Mr. Laidler for the 
first locture of the season 1916-17. 
All students of the four schools are 
cordially invited to attendFriday, 
November 17th, in room 104 of tho 
Industries building.

FOR M. M. C. S. GIRLS
For half an hour last Thursday noon 
all M. M. C. S. enjoyed one of the

RADIO STATION HEARS
ELECTION RETURNS
(Continued From Page One.) 
cago Marconi station and the United 
States government station at Arling
ton. Fragmentary reports were 
picked up occasionally from the Mar
coni station at Miami, Florida, and 
Cape Cod, Massachusetts. It was well 
along in the evening, after most of 
the New York papers had conceded 
th election to Charles E. Hughes, 
that a faint click came into the Tech 
receiver from Miami to the effect 
that "Wilson is elected by a sfe 
majority, all of which proves that 
even a wireless machine is suscep
tible to political pull.
Telephone service with the election 
bureaus of some Pittsburgh newspa
pers had been fitted up for this oc
casion, and as the returns came in 
from these souces the Tech boys 
flashed them out over their wireless 
to hundreds of amateurs within the 
radius of Techs sending station, 
amounting to about two hundred 
miles. In this way farmers and other 
folk who did not .have the benefit of 
a telegraphic bulletin service were 
provided with news of the election 
returns at first hand and without de
lay.
About ten-thirty the Tech operator 
received word over the telephone that 
"All is over. Hughes has 277 elec
toral votes, which gives him the 
election. This was not long after
wards confirmed by a wireless dis
patch from the New York Herald. 
Accordingly the operator set to work, 
prepared his code, turned on his 
power and flashed the intelligence of 
Hughes certain election to the hun
dreds of wireless clients that were 
picking up the waves that Tech was 
sending out. However, before the 
night was up different reports began 
to trickle in, and the boys decided 
it would be necessary to retract the 
Information previously sent and to 
apologize for their remissness. Dur
ing the course of the evening Profes
sor Van Dyke, who was at the oper
ating desk, heard a little by-play that 
illustrates how the little fellows in 
the game are treated. There was a 
great buzz going on in the receiver 
and he could pick out the "voice of 
no particular station. But soon a 
very clear and powerful tune was 
heard to click, "Do you intend to get 
off my wave or not? It was the 
New York Herald speaking tp some 
amateur on Manhattan Island, who 
was /.interfering with the. Heralds 
work-.  certain quiet ensued and 
Mr. Van Dyke alleges that the called 
amateur "got off.
The Tech Radio club, under whose 
auspices the election returns were 
sent, is an organization of students 
of the School of Applied Science. 
The wireless apparatus belongs to 
the school but is loaned to the club, 
which operates it under the direction 
of Professor A. F. Van Dyke, instruc
tor in elctrical engineering. At the 
present time only four students in 
the club are allowed to operate the 
wireless equipment, and they are 
commercial operators, having received 
their licenses from the government. 
These students have had experience 
working during the summer on lake 
steamers and various commercial sta
tions. The work election night was 
under the direction of Mr. Van DykeHe had as his assistants, Raymond
B. Greenberg, of 249 Wick street, 
Pittsburgh, and Charles K. Little, of 
Toledo.

interests of the "night toilers. He 
has shown himself to be a consistent 
and effective "booster since his ad
vent to the school, and we have overy 
fconfldence that his connection with 
the Activities board means that the 
existence of the night school will be 
recognized more than heretofore. He 
was class president last year, and 
the success of the class social events 
were in no small degree due to his 
efforts.
Of the "Thistle board representa
tives, Morgan is the more experi
enced office-holder, having proven to 
his class his worth as a leader while 
fulfilling the duties of. president dur
ing its second year! This is Sum
mers first "Charge, but those who 
are well acquainted with him know 
his punch, and much is expected of 
him.
Another matter to which he would 
like to call attention is the exclusion 
of the night representative from the 
Junior Prom Jcommittee. This is not 
according to precedent, and the rea
son for this .is not apparent. The 
nightmens booth was as busy as 
most at last years function, and just 
why they are to have no voice in the 
arrangements this year is not clear.
TECH PLAY PITT IN
FINAL GAME OF SEASON
(Continued From Page One.) 
ing 169 pounds.
In Seidel, a former Bellefonte 
academy boy, Warner has indeed a 
valuable man. Seidel tips the beam 
at 208 pounds and stands six feet 
high. Seidel will play right tackle, 
opposing McFeaters of Tech. This 
is his second year on the squad.
When Soppitt, the big right guard, 
was incapacitated through injuries, 
it was thought he could not be re
placed. But in Dale Sies a 196 
pounder, of Davenport High, Warner 
has every bit his equal. The only 
trouble with Sies is that he is too 
good natured. If Dale were to be
come angry he would surely get an 
All-Ameicran mention. This is Sies 
second year on the squad. He will 
play opposite Kelly of Tech.
Robert D. Peck, last years AllAmerican center and this years cap
tain, hardly needs mentioning. He is 
too well known. The aggressive Bob 
has the habit of throwing every 
ounce of his 175 pounds into every 
play. This is Peck's fourth and last 
year on the squad. He graduated 
from Loclhaven Normal before en
tering Pitt. Opposing Peck will be 
the scrappy Hellstrom, captain of the 
Plaid.
Some men are never spectacular, 
but it is the coach that knows their 
worth. They dont have to 
jump at the last minte. They j 
are already there. Such a man 
is Sutherland, Pitts big left 
guard. He is a product of Oberlin 
academy. feeing 191 pounds in 
weight and six feet one inch t^ll, 
Sutherland is some man. He plays 
opposite Fletcher in the game with 
Tech.
Claudius Earle Thornhill is some 
name, but no one would ever hint 
that he was a dude once lie saw 
that young giant, Claudius Earle. 
Thornhill is another man of. the 
Sutherland type. Thornhill hales 
from Beaver High. He weighs 193 
pounds and is six feet one inch tall. 
He opposes Grady in the coming 
game.
Clifford Carlson at right end is a 
fit running mate of the fleet Herron. 
Carlson, familiarly known as "Red, 
is another of the reasons for the Pitt 
supremacy. Carlson is flve feet nine 
inches high and weighs 168 pounds.
For the first few games of the sea
son Coach Warner was considerably 
worried. With the graduation of Wil
liamson he had no man fit to plug 
the hole at quarterback, and then 
along came Jim Morrow. Morrow is 
probably the best man on the team 
at taking out'interference. He'hales 
from Carnegie High and has been 
three years on the squad. Morrow 
handles the ball but Jimmie Dehart 
calls the signals.
In quiet, competent James Dehart, 
Warner has another star. Dehart is 
a brainy field gnral, and as an 
open field runner is in a class by 
himself along with his co-star, Hast
ings. When Jimmie runs the end be
hind formidable Hastings and Mor
row, it takes some end to stop them. 
Gibson and Wright will have their 
work cut out for them. . Jimmie 
comes from Kiski along with Hast
ings. Jimmie weighs 158 pounds and 
stands five feet seven inches. Red 
Hastings weighs 175 pounds and is 
five feet nine inches in height. Red 
was All-American halfback last year 
and seems due to grab it again this 
year.
McLaren at' fullback caps the Pitt 
team. He hits the enemies line like 
 battering ram. It is said that if 
a board were held two feet above 
tfie ground, McLaren would go under 
it every time. Like nearly all of 
the Pitt squad, McLaren is a home 
product. McLaren comes from Pea
body high. He has a powerful build, 
meant to withstand shocks. Mac tips 
the beam at 179 pounds. This is his 
second year on the squad.
In the game next Saturday, Tech 
does not count on winning, but will 
be pleased if they hold Pitt to a low 
score. Pitt has the faster and heaVier team and it takes a mighty good 
aggregation to hold them.
pictures turned out remarkaMy well, 
showing two of the touchdowns, sev
eral goals, and many of the most ex 
citing runs. These pictures with the 
Pitt-Penn game and the Pitt-State 
game will be presented to the athletic 
council of Pitt for future generations 
to witness.
Wednesday, the greatest laughing 
success in motion pictures, "Tillies 
punctured Romance, will be shown. 
Charlie Chaplin, Mabel Normand and 
Marie Dressier are the stars and none 
can say there are any greater in the 
line of screen comedians. This pic
ture holds the attendance record at 
every Rowand and Clark Theatera 
sure indication of its laughter produc
ing qualities. >
Thursday, Lenore Ulrich in The In
trigue, is on the bill, a story of in
ternational politics, full of action and 
ginger. The fourth of the Scarlet 
Runner series will also be shown.
Friday, Lew Fields and Doris Ken
yon in The Man Who Stood Still," 
will be the attraction, a play said to 
be the Music Master of the screen. 
It is replete with humor and pathos, 
well combined. Every criticism of 
this picture has been -enthusiastic. 
Saturday, Virginia Pearson in The 
War Brides Secret is shown. The 
picture while touching on a war sub
ject, does not portray imitation bat
tle fields but is a straight drama of 
intense appeal, lightened by touches 
of real humor, and with a happy end
ing.^ Monday, yiola Dana, one of the 
prettiest and most attractive of screen 
actresses in seen in The Gates of 
Eden, a play based On the Shaker 
sect, full of romance, good direction 
and real acting. Tuesday, Vivian Mar 
tin, one of the cutest and most allur
ing of all screen maids, is seen in 
Her Fathers Son. In which Miss 
Martin masquerades as a boy. It is a 
comedy drama of dainty prettiness 
and can not help but please.

where lie went through high school. 
His work on the basket ball floor was 
sb good that he was elected captain. 
Schuyler had no football team, so 
Fletcher played his first football at 
Carnegie Tech. It was Coach Steff
en who developed this big fellow into 
an able warrior. At Pitt, Fletcher 
will play his last game he being a 
Senior in the Science School.
If Fletcher were to choose an AllAmerican there is not doubt about 
who would be quarterback. He said. 
Sunny is just about as good a 
quartenback as there is in the coun
try.
Referring to the Yale game, If we 
had a full team in against Yale, we 
would have done 100 per cent better; 
He wouldnt venture an opinion about 
Pitt, saying we were keeping quiet 
about what we were going to do. 
Assistant Coach Eyeman.
In a recent talk, Mr. Eyman said, 
If none of our men are injured, we 
have a good chance to hold Pitt to a 
low score."
Yes, Kesner is deserving' of a 
place on the All-American. If Sun
ny gets a place on any one of Mr. 
Camps All-Amrican teams we will 
be well pleased.
Frank E. Altdoerfer.
Frank E. Altdoerfer, the big 
fullback from Lisbon, Ohio, came to 
us last year to take up the noble 
art of trombone playing, as well as 
showing us how the line plunging 
and kicking game should be played. 
To say he has succeeded is putting 
it mildly, for he has proved a star 
at both. His playing has been noth
ing short of wonderf.ul, and his great 
line smashes have made many a 
needed first down for us.
Salt is one of the pep artists 
of the squad, and one of the best 
liked, as well as being one of the 
big boys, as he tips the scales at 175 
and only lacks 1-2 inch of being six 
feet tall. He has had much prelim
inary training before he entered 
Tech, as he starred for a year each 
at Brown and Hiram, but every one 
bemoans these honors for wo all real
ize this is his last year and that the 
game Saturday with Pitt will be his 
last gridiron battle for the big Plaid 
team.

CHRYSANTHEMUMS
FOR THE TECH-PITT GAMELast Friday evening in Carnegie 
Union, the Plebes of the Industries 
School tendered a dance to the faculty 
and the Upper and Middle Classmen. 
The affair was largely attended and 
was a decided success in every re
spect. Ferruccis Orchestra furnished 
the music in a most excellent man
ner, which called forth numerous en
cores. If this affair might be taken 
as a criterion, big things are to be ex
pected from the Plebes in the future, 
vas they showed themselves to be on 
the job every minute.
Among the guests of honor present 
were Director Hamerschlag, Dean and 
Mrs. Connelly and Mr. Hartman. The 
committee in charge consisted of Yergey, Mansfield, Howell, Cohen and 
Steele, chairman.
We have the mammoth variety that every girl likes.

school alma mater, and Williston can 
well be proud of his 172 pounds of 
avoirdupois. For the past two sea
sons Nig has held down the posi
tion of right halfback as it was never 
filled before. Heavy and fast, he is 
equally feood at running the ends and 
hitting the line, as well as being one 
of the best open field runners that 
ever stepped on Tech field. Just 
ask any one who saw him get away 
for those long snake-like, zigzag 
runs in the Allegheny and Bethany 
games this year.
Besides being one of the best in 
every way himself, he was respon
sible for bringing another star , to us 
this yearGradyand we are more 
than lucky to have him with us for 
two more years.
E. F. Kelly.
E. F. Kelly, Design 1915), prepared 
in Rockville High school and the 
School of Applied Industries, where 
he graduated in 1915. "Red, one 
of the huskies of the squad, weigh
ing slightly over 190 pounds and 
standing five feet eleven and a quar
ter inches from the floor, is fast as 
suming the title of "the toothless 
wonder, as he lost two molars in 
the Yale game as Svell as another ono 
in practice.
Under Coach Steffen he has devel
oped into one of the best guards in 
this part, of the state, playing a game 
that is equally brilliant on the offense 
and defense, as can be ascertained 
by his great work against Yale and 
Cornell this year. 1-Ie will prove a 
tower of strength in the Pitt game, 
as well as next year, his last yoar 
of football.
John S. McFeaters.
John S. McFeaters, Science *18, 
varsity tackle for two years, had his 
preliminary education in football at. 
Greensburg High school, and ho

ager Gearhart speak on the Pitt game. 
Coach Steffen did not indulge in pre
dictions, which are not in his line of 
activity, but he expected that after 
the Pitt game had become history the 
country at large would ho hearing 
even more about Carnegie Tech than 
it has thus far, and it has been dis
cussing Techs football achievements 
at some length already. The team, he 
said, had been working very hard on 
some surprises for ourselves as well 
as Pitt. He looked forward to the 
game with confidence and expects 
with.the assistance of the rooting abil
ities of Tech to demonstrate some 
new form.
Manager Gearhart also spoke in the 
same vein as the Coach and when he 
had finished "Red Merrill took the 
time in practicing his lungs and those 
of his fellow students for Saturday's 
doings.

munity: Obtaining a safe water sup
ply; satisfactorily disposing of wastes, 
otc. The specific problems under
taken included: A sanitary survey
of the whole farm; (lie examination 
(daily In some cases) of all water 
supplios on the farm; bacteriological 
examination of the milk produced, 
with some very Interesting results in 
an attempt to produce a better grade 
of milk; the examination- of the Frooport filtration plant, and the examin
ation of the rlyer water at various 
points above and below the camp.
Many visitors, good food, the 
cares of the household and the keep
ing ofi a log book (accessible to the 
initiated only) sufficed to fill the in
tervals between agar making and the 
taking of samples, so that there was
camp. It was a splendid outing and 
just the type of work to better fit the 
men for the profession they wish to 
enter.
It Is possible that in later issues 
of the Tartan, some discussion of the 
sanitary conditions of "The Farm 
will appear.
Result of Water Examination.
In its course of one hundred and 
fifty miles the Allegheny river re
ceives sewage and waste products of 
various kinds from hundreds of cities, 
towns, factories and small communi
ties. The water, reasonably pure at 
its source, is contaminated from 
time to time before it is finally mixed 
with the water of the Monongahela 
at Pittsburgh. It 'would then appear 
that the river is progressively con
taminated from source to mouth and 
that the water at Pittsburgh must be 
more or less dilute sewage from 
towns along the course of the river. 
The surprising and apparently con
tradictory feature of the condition of 
the river water is that its sanitary 
cjualities at Nadine, for example, are 
not essentially different from those 
at Oil City, over a hundred miles 
above. This fact is indeed fortunate 
from both an economical and an es
thetic point of view, but it does not 
relieve from responsibility and dan
ger those who pollute or use the wa
ter at any point in its course.
It is true that the water does not 
become cumulatively worse from the 
source to the mouth of the river, and 
the explanation of this fact is found 
in the so-called "Self-Purification of 
Streams, which term means the abil
ity of running water to rid itself of 
deleterious substances and organisms 
through various physical and biolog
ical agencies. In general, it is found 
that the amount of self-purification 
depends upon the distance the water 
travels without, further contamination 
and that self-purification applies, 
to some extent at least, to all bodies 
of water. Occasionally there is 
found a small stream, with banks 
densely populated throughout the 
length of its course, whose water un
dergoes very little self-purification. 
Such a body of. water is not simply 
a stream but is an open sewer.
The river in the vicinity of Camp 
Louise Carnegie was found to pre
sent an excellent opportunity to 
study this  "self-purification on a 
small scale, since, after receiving the 
sewage of Freeport, the banks of the 
river are practically uninhabited for 
several miles. On September the 5th 
a series of water samples from the 
Allegheny was taken, the first sample 
just aljove Freeport, the next at the 
junction of the Buffalo creek and the 
Allegheny river, and three more far
ther down tilio river at intervals of 
one mile. Samples were taken in 
midstream for the sake of uniformity 
and in order to obtain a f.air saniplo 
at the junction of the Buffalo aiul the! 
Allegheny; that is to say, if a sample 
had boon taken near a sewer outlet, 
it would have boon a sample of sew
age and would not have indicated the 
effect of the pollution on the river 
as a whole. The ordinary routine 
bacteriological tests wore made with 
the following results:
Sample, abovo FreeportLit. lac. 
agar/ 80 acid cols; agar, 040 per c.
gelatin, 000 per c. c.; lactose -bilo, 
gas produced, over 10 percent.
At Buffalo and AlleghenyLit. lac.

bile, gas produced, over 10 percent.
One mile down riverLit. lac agar. 
600 acid cols.; agar., 1000 per c. c.; 
gelatin, 225 per c. c.; lactose bile, 
gas produced, over 10 percent.
Two miles down riverLit. lac. 
agar., 100 per acid cols:; agar., 30 per 
c.; gelatin, 60 per c. c.; lactose bile, 
gas produced, over 10 percent.
Three miles down riverLit. lac. 
agar., 200 acid cols; agar., 380 per c. 
c.; gelatin, 100 per c. c.; lactose bile, 
gas produced, over 10 percent.
In order that these results may be 
understood without going into the de
tails of the significance of the dif
ferent tests, it must be known that 
the number of bacteria per cubic cen
timeter of a good water, that is, a 
water fit f.or drinking, is lownot 
above 100, in general. Also, 
pure water, the ratio of the gelatin 
count to the agar count should be 
less than 10 to 1. The presence of 
lactose fermenting organisms, as in
dicated by the production of acid in 
litmus lactose agar and by the pro
duction of gas in lactose bile, is in
dicative of sewage pollution, especial
ly if the numbers are high or the 
gas produced exceeds ten percent.
From the variations in the bacteri
al counts, if, is seen that the river 
water is contaminated to a consider
able oxtoiit by the sewago at Free
port, which is a town of .only four 
or five thousand inhabitants; that 
there is a. very gradual improvement 
in the water below Freeport; but 
that the water is not fit for drinking, 
either above or below the town. This 
brings us to realize the importance 
of carefully examining a water be
fore using it to supply any communi
ty, no matter how small, and, finding
to render it not only clear and pal
atable, but also free from the germs 
of any of the water borne diseases 
such as typhoid or cholera, must be 
apparent.
Freeport is under considerable ex
pense because of the fact that the 
water, contaminated by towns above, 
must be filtered before it can be used 
by Freeport, which town, in turn, 
dumps its raw sewage into the river 
as a menace to the towns below. 
Pittsburgh is in a similar situation, 
maintaining a large filtration plant 
at Asp inwall, necessitated by con
tamination of the river from towns 
above; at the same time our city 
turns an enormous volume of raw 
sewage into the river, endangering 
the lives and health of many persons 
farther down the Ohio. The natural 
fortunate situation of our river cities 
prevents them from using their own 
sewage, somewhat diluted, for a wa
ter supply, but this is a very common 
condition in cities located on lake 
fronts. Many epidemics of water
borne diseases have been traced to 
this "rotary system, and too often 
it is only after an epidemic that 
communities can see the necessity of 
providing a safe water system.
The condition of. rivers such as the 
Allegheny is obnoxious and discour
aging, but it is not hopeless. Laws 
have been passed requiring the treat
ment of all sewage before it is turned 
into streams. These laws have not 
yet been enforced because of lack of 
public instruction, and hence public 
support in such matters. If one or 
two towns along the river do comply 
with the law and go to the trouble 
an,d -expense of treating their sewage, 
they not only do not receive any re
turn on their investments, but they 
do not improve the general condition 
of the river to any extent because of 
contamination from so many sources | 
above; The ideal way to remedy the I 
condition would be to start at the 
source of'*a stream, safeguard this 
firom pollution and then, following 
the course of the stream, require ev
ery community to purify or treat its 
sewage or waste in such a manner 
as to render it unobjectionable. This 
would give us rivers of decent ap
pearance and free from objectionable 
odors, would greatly decrease the 
cost of treating water for domestic 
use, and would have a general bene
ficial effect on the public health, and 
in addition, it would be a more hon
est and respectable procedure.
