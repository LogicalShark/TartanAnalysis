(ASE BEATEN IN INTERESTING GAME
SdENIlSTS OFFER STUBBORN RESISTANCE
On Van Horn Field, Cleveland, last 
Saturday, several thousand enthsuiastic spectators witnessed the sixth 
consecutive decisive victory of the 
plaid gladiators. The weather was 
ideal for the players but just a little 
cool for the on-lookers who warmed 
themselves finally by giving the game 
their undivided interest and express
ing their feelings by wild leaps and 
gesticulations. The Case rooters and 
band were first on the field and but 
mildly expressed themselves. Soon 
the loyal Techites appeared in 
pee-rade formation and completely 
filled the large grandstand at the op
posite side of the field. The first 
spirited cheer was a revalation of the 
old pep that brought rounds of ap
plause from the assembled throng, 
and was recognized as the most spir
ited and best delivered support that 
had ever appeared in Cleveland. All 
through the game this spirit rallied 
the players and played a large part 
in negotiating a big victory from 
what lookedin the first quarterto 
be a doubtful proposition.
Kesner Displays Grit.
Sunny limped into the game on 
one leg and was the object of a con
centrated assault through the entire 
game. Few such exhibitions of pluck
have been seen for it was evident that 
he played all through on his nerve. 
Sunny was able to essay only sev
eral runs, but gained on each occa
sion. Had he been uninjured the 
score would have undoubtedly been 
doubled. Also the plays didnt get 
started so quickly and in such speedy 
succession as they have been pre
viously. Finlay and Marshal had 
trouble in gaining the first part of the 
game from regular formation, al
though they could hardly be stopped 
in the open field.
Aultdoerffer Most Consistent Gainer.
Aultdoerffer could be relied upon 
most any time for several yards 
through the line from regular forma
tion or on a delayed pass, and time 
after time negotiated first down for 
the visiting Pittsburghers. His best 
gains were through right guard and 
the line played its part by making him 
some room. On the defense the line 
was penetrated but once and Case was 
forced to resort to a kicking attack 
which proved to be somewhat of a 
live-saver.
The Line.
The defensive play of the line was 
a feature for Tech and also for Case. 
Hellstrom, Fletcher and Kelly 
brought down their man on many

FIRST PERFORMANCE OF 
TARTUFFE.
A. I. E. E. STUDENT SECTION 
MEETING.
The dramatic season at Tech had a 
triumphant opening Monday evening, 
November first, in the play Tartuffe, 
by Moliere, directed by Donald Rob
erts. New settings, furniture, scen
ery and costumes, and brilliant act
ing made it one of the best plays the 
school has ever produced.
Mr. Robertson was in Chicago at 
the time but was telegraphed of the 
success of his caste. Miss Eula Guy 
starred as the typical, pertinent 
French soubrette, Dorine; while Mr. 
Steens interpretation of Tartuffe, the 
hypocrite, was pronounced by Gran
ville Barker, the prominent New York 
author and producer, who saw the 
play, as a keen and finished piece of 
acting.
Miss Guthrie, who played Madame 
Remela, and her poor little frightened 
maid, Flipotto, succeeded in making 
her audience laugh over and over and 
Mr. Viehman, who played Orgon, the

Large Crowd Will Witness Contest. 
Rooting Duel Will Be Feature.
On Wednesday evening, November 
3rd, the Student Branch of the A. I. 
E. E. were treated to an interesting 
talk by Mr. T. A. Schoepf, chairman 
of the Pittsburgh Section of the A. I. 
E. E.
Mr. Schoepfs talk was on the rela
tion of the Institute to the engineer
ing student and convinced most, if 
not all of the members, to join the 
A. I. E. E.
The speaker said that one of the 
most horrible failings of engineers 
was the inability to express them
selves clearly on any engineering sub
ject. This might be remedied by the 
persons getting on his feet and dis
cussing various topics as they are 
brought up. Ample opportunity for 
this is given in the meetings of the 
A. I. E. E.
Mr. Hecker, of the Pittsburgh Rail
ways Co., also gave a few remarks 
along the same lines.

The one athletic contest of the year 
at which every Tech student is ex
pected to be present whether he has 
a job or not falls next Saturday. From 
the alumni to the faculty every one 
who has ever been connected with this 
institution has a date at Forbes Field 
at two-thirty on the afternoon of 
November the thirteenth in order to 
help by whatever slight assistance 
they can render our undefeated eleven 
maintain for the entire season their 
present record.
Last year it was conceded by all the 
Pittsburgh papers that our cheering 
section clearly outrooted and outsung 
the Pitt delegatiin. One of the 
evening papers has already hinted 
that such might be the case again 
this year, which dig was deep enough 
to draw a reply from the editorial col
umns of the Pitt Weekly. In order 
to maintain this reputation this year 
it will be necessary for every stu
dent to be on the job, armed with 
megaphones, and to give his entire 
lung power at the wish of the cheer 
leader. The largest crowd that ever 
saw a Tech team play in this city 
is expected and there is no reason 
why we should not give them the 
best rooting and singing that they 
ever witnessed at any of the other 
contests on Forbes Field. It will be 
necessary for every student to attend 
the two mass meetings this week to 
secure absolute unanimity in the 
cheering and perfect knowledge of 
all the songs that will be used.
Tickets for the game, both in the 
grandstand and in the cheering sec
tion are on sale at the pursars office. 
Student tickets plus twenty-five cents 
admit to the cheering section. It was 
found impossible to continue last 
years system of admitting to the 
cheering section by student ticket 
only, the cost to the Athletic Associa
tion being too great. Admission to

WILLIAM N. FREW.
Carnegie Institute has lost one of 
its most earnest workers, in the death 
of William N. Frew. He was, until 
the appearance of the illness, in 
March, 1914, that eventually caused 
his death, identified in an official 
capacity with the city government and 
the Institute. Mr. Frew was born in 
1854, graduated from Yale in 1876, 
admitted to bar 1879. He was an 
active member in municipal affairs, 
having been member of Council from 
1885 to 1887.
Mr. Frew was a man of public spirit 
and back of and originator of the 
many movements of Council. He was 
one of the first trustees of the Car
negie Library when it was founded. 
Mr. Frew, it is safe to say, was one 
of the staunch supporters of Tech. 
He saw it in embryo, its growth and 
culmination which was one of his 
greatest desires. He always had time 
to do his best for Carnegie Tech, in 
fact gave a great part of his time 
and thought for its benefit. Beside 
being Mr. Carnegies personal repre
sentative in Pittsburgh and vicinity, 
Mr. Frew had a successful practice in 
law, being one of the citys foremost 
lawyers, but retired quite a number 
of years ago.
Mr. Frew was active in all Carnegie
enterprises. He was a member of 
the Board of Trustees of the Carne
gie Institution of Washington, D. C., 
of Carnegie Corporation, New York 
City, of Carnegie Hero Fund, of 
Teachers Fund, and ex-president of 
Board of Trustees of Carnegie Insti
tute of Technology. In the business 
and social life of Pittsburgh he took 
active part, having been on the direc
torate of several banking institutions, 
was a trustee of the Pennsylvania Col
lege for Women, and a member of 
different clubs. Mr. Frew was also 
president of the Pittsburgh Orchestra 
for a number of years.
Tech feels that the loss of Mr. 
Frew, who has done so much for its 
development, cannot be expressed. 
It was in the early years of the Car 
negie enterprises, that Mr. Frews 
services were needed. Then the un
dertakings demanded the attention of 
someone of keen judgment, artistic 
appreciation and unselfish interest to 
insure their success. These and other 
qualities Mr. Frew gave and he had 
the satisfaction of seeing all the splen
did affairs take on a firmness that was 
lasting.
THE BATTLE.
The story of the Case game is now 
perhaps more or less a thing of the 
past. We all know how we went to 
Cleveland hopeful, and with a fair de
gree of confidence, most of us saw 
the great battle on the Case field, for 
a battle it was! Perhaps a discus
sion of the event is unnecessary and 
useless from a cold practical stand
point, it might be considered indis
creet in the sense that self praise is 
immodest. But who can blow as 
for recalling the thrills of the battle, 
the exultant joy of the victory, and 
the enthusiastic gratitude we felt for 
our eleven? Who can blame us for 
lingering a few moments upon the ad
miration and esteem we feel for our 
team?
We would like to linger and dwell 
upon each one of our heroes, and for 
each one we could find ample cause 
for merited praise. A few facts of 
last Saturday, however, are outstand
ing in our memory. One of the first 
of which is the pluck and sand evi
denced by our Sunny. Handicapped 
with painful injuries, the object of 
continued rough play, always using 
the best judgment, and never making 
a poor play, he led his team to a vic
tory, which was to no small extent 
due to his generalship, and despite 
his injuries did more than his share 
of actual play. Kessy is our idea 
of a hero!
Our cheer leader, Dink Merrill, 
deserves no small share of credit for 
the showing Carnegie made at Cleve
land, always evidencing a spirit of fair 
play and true sportsmanship he stands 
out as a man Tech is proud of. A 
Cleveland paper says in part of his 
results: Carnegie Tech had more
rooters on Case field yesterday, when 
the Pittsburgh lads swamped the 
Casers, than the Scientists. Between 
halves, when the Case band and 
rooters formed a circle on the grid
iron, the visitors with a snappy band 
of their own, enclosed the local root
ers in a larger ring, completely shut
ting in the Cleveland noise-makers.
In our enthusiasm we are wondering 
today who is the greater coach, Stagg 
or Steffen? Staggs reputation as a 
coach requires no elaboration, not un
mindful of this, we still maintain our 
doubt.
The showing that Carnegie made 
last Saturday, both on the field and in 
the bleachers, is an ideal to maintain 
for which no improvement can be 
suggested.
THE Y. M. C. A.
The Y. M. C. A. movement will be 
followed up by a general meeting in 
the Design School Theatre next Sun
day afternoon, November 14, at 3 
oclock. Mr. Ehlers, State Secretary, 
is coming to Pittsburgh to develop 
the organization and will deliver the 
principal address. There will also be 
interesting talks by prominent local 
Y. M. C. A. men.
What we need in the Association 
right from the start is enthusiasm 
and plenty of it. Let us fill the thea
tre and crowd the aisles. We will 
have excellent speaking, special mu
sic, songsin which all will have an 
opportunity to join,and everyone 
will go away feeling that the after
noon has been well spent.
We need an organization like this 
at Carnegiean organization for spir
itual betterment, bringing out the best 
in every man, democratic in its pur
poses, and affording an opportunity 
for the entire student body to get to
gether often. Such an opportunity 
has long been need; now it is here 
and we hope you will derive the bene
fit of it. No other activity can be 
so profitable to the individual student. 
He is brought into personal contact 
with other Tech men, he sees the best 
in their virtues and at the same time 
may approach the ideal of his own. 
The college cannot develop character; 
the student body must do this, and 
the Y. M. C. A. is, and always has 
been, successful in performing this 
function.
Let every man be out next Sunday. 
We are going to make this movement 
a success and we want you to enjoy 
the fruits of this success. You can 
only do so by participating in the 
work from the very start.
FAST TIME MADE IN CROSS 
COUNTRY TRYOUTS.
Prospects Bright For Good Team.
In the tryouts held over the regular 
six-mile course in Schenley Park the 
following five men of the cross coun
try squad made the team, finishing in 
the order named: Capt. Rieser,
Moore, Dockstader, Walker, Lawson. 
Andrews finished a close sixth. 
Among these five the only new face 
is that of Lawson, a novice of this 
year, who has been coming strong 
and with two years ahead of him 
should be heard from.
These five should form an excellent 
team. The first four are all last 
years distance men on the track 
team and brought the time for the 
course down to a point that was emi
nently satisfactory to Coach Dull.
The first meet will be the P. A. A. 
invitation in which a team from that 
club, Pitt, State and Westminster will 
also compete. This race will start 
and end at Forbes Field just before 
the football game. A week later the 
University of Wooster sends their 
crack team here for a dual meet and 
on Thanksgiving our team may also 
enter the annual meet at Crafton.
JUST NOTES.
Some parades on the trip. New 
Castle and Youngstown saw their 
first college demonstrations. The 
band made a fine impression.
There was a crowd in the main 
street of New Castle to see the re
turn but owing to the rain there was 
no parade.
Some five hundred students met 
the team at the Union station on their 
return and gave them a great recep
tion. Coach Steffen was hoisted and 
carried outside where he made an im
promptu speech. Later many repaired 
to the Fort Pitt and drowned out the 
Pitt and W. & J. rooters.
About twenty students who couldnt 
make up their minds until the last 
minute whether the Case game was 
worth seeing were left out in the cold 
when they tried to buy tickets at the 
car Saturday morning and had to go 
by regular trains.
Many students went up in autos 
and via railroad either Friday or Sat
urday.
Gibson played a strong game. One 
of his tackles in the open field was 
so hard that time was called for the 
runner to recuperate.
In spite of Aultdoerffers game leg 
he played his usual hard game as did 
Brunwasser, who relieved him in the 
last quarter.
Finlay drew a laugh when he 
dodged in such a way after receiving 
a punt that the two Case ends banged 
into each other and were both laid 
out. Incidentally Finlay ran for 
forty yards.
Cases touted line certainly was a 
failure. Also, where are those thirty 
points that they were to run up 
against us?
McFeaters style of interfering is 
rather peculiar. It looked as though 
he was patting the Case man on the 
back when interfering during Mar
shals long run.

THE MEDIEVAL BALL
Art schools throughout the United 
States and Europe lay much emphasis 
upon the various dances and balls 
given during the year. It has now 
become an established custom, and 
one responded to with keen delight, 
at the Design School, the art nucleus 
of Pittsburgh, to give a number of 
balls during each scholastic year. 
These are costumed after a definite 
period such as the Greek, Roman, Or
iental and Medieval eras, and have 
proved social functions of intense in
terest. In establishing such a cus
tom the Design students have done 
so in a competitive way, setting the 
highest possible standard of genuine
pleasure and at the same moment 
placing themselves before other im
portant art schools in a manner com
manding their attention and admira
tion.
The accompanying cut, made from 
an etching by Howard Imhoff of the 
Design School, shows a perspective 
view of the main corridor about as 
it will appear tonight when the doors 
of Charlemanges Court are opened.
As a student body we are deeply 
indebted to Howard Pierce and Pridgeon Smith who originated the idea 
of the masque in connection with the 
ball. With eager willingness Howard 
Smith and Theodore H. Viehman 
have crystallized it to a concrete form
and the masque in itself will prove an 
incident of genuine fertility and true 
artistic temper.Ready for Inspection

DORM. PARTY.
On Saturday night, October 23, the 
Plebes of the Fifth Avenue Dormitory 
gave a Halloween party for the up
perclassmen.
The ghost-like figures assembled in 
a second floor room and by the light 
of one lone candle solemnly marched 
down the stairs out the front door to 
enter again by the celler way.
At the door of the parlor was the 
wierdest reception line. The parlor 
itself was lighted only by the rays 
which streamed through the grotesque 
faces of the many jack o lanterns. 
There was a profusion of corn stalks 
and beautiful autumn leaves in the 
corner. One unique feature of the 
harmonious decorations was a scare
crow propped up on a broomstick.
After unmasking the girls played 
charades, forfeits and bobbed for ap
ples. Behind a screen was a gypsy 
fortune-teller who disclosed to each 
girl her future happiness.
Cider, popcorn, pumpkin pie and 
the best apples constituted the eats.
The part that the upperclassmen 
enjoyed was that they could go up 
stairs after having a good time and 
leave the dirty work for the Plebes.
STUDENTS ASSEMBLY.
On Tuesday the regular monthly 
students assembly was held. Miss 
Constance Stout spoke first concern
ing the Shilling, which is to appear
at Thanksgiving. She urged all the 
girls to subscribe or otherwise it 
would not be possible to produce it 
in a way creditable to M. M. C. S. 
Miss Sanford announced the Guild 
Business Meeting and Miss Wilson 
made a short announcement concern
ing the Thistle. Miss Mary McKhan 
gave two readings, the first of which 
was The Girl I Used To Know. 
Miss Mary Ride spoke concerning 
the work of the Self-Government As
sociation and of its latest and success
ful method of upholding the honor of 
the school. A new plan is in order 
for the Lunch Room. Before 12:30 
Juniors may enter before Sopho
mores, after that time admittance will 
be gained in order of appearing. 
Plebes will not be admitted before 
12:50. Seniors take precedence at all 
times, while girls not buying lunch 
may enter at any time.
REGULAR ASSEMBLY.
The regular weekly assemly was 
held Wednesday. Dean Breed presid
ed and in a short talk spoke excellent
ly of the work done by the SelfGovernment Association, which had 
taken the honor of the school at heart 
and had accomplished its purpose in 
a particularly careful and successful 
manner. Dean Breed also went on to 
say that in any school activity the 
members must not only be lookerson but must also be doers. It is only 
in this way that one can identify 
oneself with the larger interests in 
the school.
Announcement was also made of a 
lecture to be given on Tuesday at 
11:30 by Mr. Ashby, who is an archi
tect, a poet and a craftsman. Mr. 
Ashby spoke at our commencement 
exercises last year and will be re
membered as an exceedingly interest
ing and witty speaker.
GUILD MEETING.
Tusday, at 3:30, the Guild held a 
business meeting in Recreation Hall. 
Very few girls were present, and con
sidering that the president had se
cured Miss Hopkins as speaker, it 
would seem no more than courteous 
for the girls to have made an effort, 
at least, to get there.
The first thing considered was the 
planning of this years calendar. It 
has always been the custom of the 
Guild to plan a school calendar which 
is sold about Christmas time, the pro
ceeds being given to charity. Several 
samples were inspected and Miss Ly
dia Bates was appointed chairman of 
a committee to further plan and in
vestigate suitable designs.
Miss Hopkins of the Social Service 
Department then spoke concerning 
the more efficient organization and 
management of the Guild, stating as 
the three-fold aim, to know, to give 
and to do. All the members should 
know something of the social prob
lems confronting workers at the pres
ent time. To accomplish this speak
ers who are interested in this .wor'- 
could be secured for the school as
semblies. Reading circles, to which 
girls might bring knitting and sew
ing for charity could be organised. 
Miss Hopkins also felt that the regu
lar business meetings should be strict
ly parliamentary and suggested that 
a model meeting be held from which 
the girls could get the right idea.

At the regular meeting of the Stu
dent Assembly held last Wednesday, 
a vote was taken to send a letter of 
condolence to the family of Mr. Wm. 
N. Frew, who was an ex-president of 
the Board of Trustees of Carnegie In
stitute, prior to his death, which was 
noted in the Tartan of last week.
The Secretary of the Assembly was 
authorized to send the following let
ter to his family:
Mrs. William N. Frew,
6516 Fifth Ave.,
Pittsburgh, Pa.
Dear Mrs. Frew:
By authority of the Student Assem
bly, School of Applied Industries, 
Carnegie Institute of Technology, I 
am herewith voicing the feeling of 
sympathy of the student body towards 
yourself and family in the death of 
Mr. Frew.
As a group of students, it was not 
our privilege to become personally 
'acquainted with Mr. Frew, but we 
have learned something of his un
selfish work and active interest in our 
behalf and so recognize, in a measure, 
the debt of gratitude we owe him and 
you, the members of his family.
Assuring you that we do revere his 
memory of which this vote of sym
pathy to you is a token, I am,
Yours very sincerely,
For the Student Assembly, 
Cronise K. Koontz.
Secretary.
The Upper and Middle classes have 
passed an amendment to the Plebe 
Regulations, that after November 1st, 
the Plebes of the School of Applied 
Industries will not De required to 
wear the green socks, but may have 
the option of black or green socks. 
This ruling, however, in no way af
fects the regulations requiring the 
wearing of green ties and Plebes 
hats, which regulations are still in 
force.
A member of the Lower class re
ceived rather an unexpected ducking 
last Thursday afternoon at the hands 
of some of his fellow classmen. The 
young man in question, who was a 
Plebe last year and is still in the 
Lower class, took it upon himself to 
most vigorously enforce Plebe Regu
lations. The Plebes took aversion to 
a man in their own class exerting so 
much authority and as a consequence, 
the ducking resulted.
The Plebe class held a meeting last 
Thursday afternoon and elected P. L.
A. Keiser, vice president. O. P. 
Kneuer, who was formerly vice presi
dent, having been transferred to the 
Middle class.
A football game between the Lower 
and Middle classes is to be played in 
the near future. The Plebes have al
ready begun practice and a large num
ber of men have signed up for the dif
ferent positions on the team.
T. J. Williams, ex-17, who is at 
present employed in his home town, 
Muncie, Ind., was renewing acquaint
ances about school last week.

by the Prom committee. The date

tain amount and send it regularly.
By doing, Miss Hopkins emphasized 
the need of social workers and that 
the members should be classified as 
either active or associate, according 
to the amount of time they were will
ing to give.
The treasurer next read her report. 
There are at present 186 members, at 
which the president gazed around the 
half empty room with a wan smile, 
wondering no doubt why they were 
not there fulfilling their duties as 
members.
Plans were then discussed for the 
big Mediaeval Christmas Party to be 
held in December. It was suggested 
that all the organizations take part 
and produce something new and at 
the same time interesting. The 
Guilds part would be to combine 
their annual bazaar with probably a 
mediaeval market place or fair, thus 
keeping it in harmony with the rest 
of the idea. A committee is to be 
appointed who will get to work imme
diately in order to produce something 
worth while.
DRAMATIC CLUB MEETING.
After several attempts the Dramatic 
Club finally succeeded in collecting 
enough girls to have a meeting. The 
constitution was read and it was de
cided to give any money realized from 
entertainments toward a scholarship. 
It was also decided to have a regular 
meeting the second Thursday in every 
month, at which time plays would be 
read and discussed. In order to bring 
the Dramatic Club more prominently 
before the notice of the students the 
officers are arranging a little skit to 
be given soon. At this time, sub
scriptions will be taken for member
ship in the club. There will be no 
admission price, the idea being mere
ly to create interest in the work of 
the Dramatic Club.
It was also voted upon and decided 
to join the other organizations in the 
production of the Mediaeval Christ
mas Party being planned; the part of 
the Dramatic Club being to produce 
a mediaeval play.
DORM PARTY.
The Morewood Avenue Dormitory 
entertained itself Monday night, No
vember 1, with a Halloween party 
from 9:30 to 11:00. Bobbing for 
apples and eating them from strings 
and dancing were the chief amuse
ments and hard candy, apples and 
pretzels were the eats.FIRST PERFORMAMCE

husband, came in for his share. Mr. 
Engle played Damis and Williamson, 
Cleavite, who read some of the best 
lines in the play. Miss Blair had the 
lead. She looked very beautiful and 
her acting was clever and interesting.
Among those present was Bishop 
Cortland Whitehead, who commented 
especially upon Miss Guys work and 
the scene between Miss Brown and 
Mr. Munnis. The majority of the 
audience which represented Pitts
burghs best known people, went 
away feeling that the play they had 
enjoyed was distinctly not amateur.
Tartuffe was repeated Thursday 
evening for the student body and the 
theatre was crowded. Mr. Francis 
Wilson, one of Americas foremost 
comedians, was the guest of the occa
sion. Mr. Wilson made a short ad
dress to the students and expressed 
his surprise and pleasure at the per
formance and the school. He revived 
past anecdotes of Molieres time and 
expressed the pleasure actors feel in 
knowing that the greatest poets and 
dramatists, such as Shakespeare, Gondoli and Moliere, were actors first and 
were known and loved by the people 
as actors, not as authors. After the 
performance Mr. Wilson visited the 
caste and congratulated them and out
side in the corridors, students held an 
impromptu dance to impromptu 
music.

the grand stand will be fifty cents 
plus the student ticket or seventyfive cents without. Box seats are 
seventy-five cents with student ticket.
Tech will occupy the same stands 
as last year. Extra bleachers have 
been erected beside our cheering sec
tion to accommodate the extra crowd 
of Tech students. As was the case 
last year there will be no parade be
tween halves.
A most exciting contest may be 
expected. Tech will be in excellent 
condition and will have an excess of 
that fighting spirit that was apparent 
last Saturday. Pitt, however, will 
probably have retrograded a little 
since the Wash-Jeff game but their 
army of substitutes will be of great 
benefit to them in maintaining the 
same form shown then. It is a cinch 
that Pitt is more worried than they 
care to confess, especially since they 
have no idea of the style of game that 
we will produce. Tech has not been 
compelled to show its hand yet this 
year and just what we have in re
serve is unknown to even the students 
themselves. So, heres hoping!A. I. E. E. STUDENT MEETING

A vigorous discussion followed, Mr. 
Schoepf answering various questions 
of the members. The speakers were 
given a rising vote of thanks at the 
end of the discussion.

nounced that Messrs. Gower and Rey

SOPHOMORE CLASS RULING.
At a meeting of the Sophomore 
class on last Wednesday, it was de
cided that all members of the present 
Plebe Class, who had been members 
of a Plebe class in any of the other 
schools of the Institute at some pre
vious time, should be excused from 
all of the Plebe restrictions. This 
ruling affects several men who, up to 
the present time, have been living 
over again the life of a new man at 
Tech.
RADIO CLUB.
The new Radio apparatus has ar
rived. The Club intends to have the 
apparatus installed and in good work
ing order before Carnegie Day No
vember 23. In order to accomplish 
this all members of the club should 
see Mr. A. F. Van Dyck at once and 
make arrangements with him to help 
at some time. It is requested that all 
new men wishing to join the club 
should see Mr. D. L. Trautman, Sen
ior Electrical, at once.
FREE TRIP TO CLEVELAND.
That the Sophomore class is right 
on the job with original ideas, was 
evidenced last Wednesday. Some 
brilliant member came forward with 
the proposition that the class should 
send a representative to the Case 
game. This idea was accepted by the 
class. In order to choose the man, 
every man present placed his name on 
a slip of paper and dropped it into 
a hat. The lucky slip was then drawn 
from the hat. The lucky man was 
Emerson Pugh. It has been suggest
ed that next year the class should 
chip together and send the whole 
class on a trip instead of one man. 
That sounds rather big, however.
ATHLETIC NOTES.
Basketball.
An inter-class basketball league is 
being planned. Classes or sections 
desiring to enter same, write out your 
entry and hand it in at the gymna
sium. Entries will close Friday af

occasions. Hellstrom could always 
be found in the middle of the play. 
Kutz and McFeaters starred on the 
tackles as they have been doing all 
year. Gibson on right end played a 
strong game. On one occasion when 
Jenkins got away from the field for 
a thirty-yard run that looked like a 
touchdown, Gibson showed a streak 
of speed and brought him down from 
behind on the opposite side of the 
field on which he plays.
Case Fights Hard.
The Case line fought a hard defen
sive game and threatened to live up 
to its reputation and out-play our rep
resentatives in this department. They 
weakened, however, towards the cru
cial moments and lacked solidity. 
Case tackled high on many occasions 
and thus detracted from an absolutely 
clean game, with "neck twisters, etc. 
Rannerman and Jenkins starred on 
the offense for the Clevelanders, Jen
kins making several large gains 
around right end by his speed and 
cleverness, and Bannerman by his 
long punts in the first of the game 
and his several gains on delayed 
passes. Howard did the kicking for 
Case after Bannerman had been 
slightly injured and though erratic 
averaged well.
The Game.
The three-hundred loyal students 
from Tech were delighted at the out
come and many remained in Cleve
land till Sunday evening, feeling that 
they had to let the whole town know 
about it in the way of large daubs of 
red paint and noise. Case supporters 
were too surprised to realize just what 
had happened and were very silent 
and modest in their expressions. 
Many of them had reason to be very 
sad in a rather mercenary way, while 
some of our men had extra weight in 
their pockets and less in their hearts. 
The spirit of the Plaid travelers is 
worthy of a eulogy and praise and 
respect can not be exaggerated in 
their behalf.
Marshal Makes First Touchdown.
The first touchdown came as a very 
agreeable surprise, and by its moral 
effect strengthened the visitors and 
weakened the Case scientists. Kutz 
kicked off high and long to the Case 
five-yard line from where it was re
turned to the thirty. Aided by a fiveyard penalty against Tech they ad
vanced eight yards where they fum
bled and Tech recovered. From here 
Marshal, Finlay, and Aultdoerffer 
made three first downs. Kesner for
warded to Gibson over the line but 
he failed to complete it and Case got 
the ball on the 20-yard mark. Then 
followed a kicking duel that netted 
Case twenty yards. Aultdoerffer had 
to hurry his punts on account of the 
Case line breaking through and was 
therefore unable to negotiate much 
distance. Here Case made a first 
down by finding a hole through left 
tackle for seven yards. Case then 
met a brick wall at right guard and 
then Fletcher broke through and 
stopped Bannerman without a gain. 
Finley next . stopped a left-end run 
and Case had made no gain in three

tries. Now a forward pass was tried 
over the right side of the line but 
Marshal was there as usual and inter
cepting it ran eighty-five yards across 
the enemys goal with McFeaters 
along as helpful interference. The 
Case admirers held their breath and 
their jaws fell down on their chests 
while pandemonium reigned in the 
Tech stand across the field and noise 
and cheers made the very air thick. 
Kutz kicked goal and the board regis
tered 7-0 for Tech and the first quar
ter but half over.
Tech Outplayed Remainder of 
Quarter.
Most of the rest of the quarter took 
the form of a punting duelHellstrom and Lauer stopping the attack 
of the Case backs, but the Case line 
also stopped our advance and kept 
most of the playing in their favor. 
Marshal, Finley, and Aultdorffer were 
either effectually stopped or thrown 
for losses the rest of the period.
Second Quarter.
At the beginning of this quarter 
Finley received a punt from Bannerman and fought and wiggled his way 
for thirty-five yards through the en
tire Case team and Kesner circled 
left end for 30 yards more. Then 
Aultdoerfer carried the ball to Cases 
5-yard line and went through right 
guard for a touchdown. Kutz kicked 
goal. Sweeney and Clarke replaced 
Bannerman and Conant.
Case kicked off to Lauer on the 
twenty-yard line and he advanced to 
the thirty-four. Here Marshal tore 
twenty-five yards off right tackle to 
the Case 30-yard line. Here the Case 
line thwarted three plunges and Kes
ner called for kick formation. Hellstrom passed over Kesners head for 
the first bad pass of the season. Kesnes recovered but the ball went to 
Case in the middle of the field. They 
were forced to punt again and How
ard got off a long one. Finley then 
punted from his twenty-yard line. 
Finley is a south-paw kicker and 
amused the spectators by his form. 
His kicks have height and distance 
and are well placed. This one he 
punted from the ten-yard mark and 
it had gone to the visitors 12-yard 
line before it was stopped. Another 
punting duel was inaugurated. Fin
ley ran back a punt for twenty yards 
through the excellent interference of 
Fletcher who took no less than three 
men at one crack and had to be re
moved from the game. On account 
of a poor kick from Howard Tech got 
the ball on the twelve-yard mark. 
Aided by a penalty and on four at
tacks Aultdoerffer was rushed through 
to a touchdown but the referee called 
the play back and penalized the Plaid 
for fifteen yards. Carnegie got the 
ball to Cases five-yard line and again 
to Cases half-yard line, but couldnt 
score. Score of second period, Car
negie 7, Case 0. Score end second 
period, Carnegie 14, Case 0.
Lively Demonstration of Spirit Be
tween Halves.
Headed by the band and a costumed 
leader the Case contingent took the
field and showed their prowess at 
rooting. The Tech boys then found a 
hole in the fence and crawled through 
onto the field. It was then seen and 
appreciated what a large crowd we 
had with us, for we outnumbered the 
Case throng and formed the varsity 
C around them. In the following 
rooting duel Tech had the upper hand 
and aided by little red megaphones 
completely drowned their rivals. Our 
band also deserves the highest com
mendation and played a most import
ant part in the days proceedings. At 
the beginning of the next period the 
Case men formed two long lines and 
ushered their team on the field in a 
royal fashion. They didnt stop here 
but in a most generous manner re
peated the performance at the arrival 
of our fellows and cheered our team 
in a very encouraging and compli
mentary manner.
Third Quarter.
Case started off the third quarter 
by showing a decided improvement 
in its defensive play. Jenkins took 
Muggs place at left half. Kutz tried 
two field goals for Tech, but failed 
both. The Pittsburghers kept the ball 
on the Scientists side of the field 
most of the period. Score third per
iod, Carnegie 0, Case 0. Score end of 
third period, Carnegie 14, Case 0.
Fourth Quarter.
Bannerman took Sweeneys place at 
the start of the fourth quarter. On 
the first play Marshal carried the 
ball from mid-field to Cases two-yard 
line and Altdoerffer took it over in 
less than one minute of play.
By means of a long run by Banner
man and then by Jenkins Case put the 
ball on our four-yard line where 
Graves carried it over on a delayed 
pass. Banner failed at goal and the 
score stood twenty-one to six.
Marshal put the ball in position for 
the next scoring by a clever run off 
left tackle and Brunwasser carried it 
over for the final score. Kutz failed 
at goal. Brunwasser had taken Altdoerffers place and made two brilliant 
plunges. At the end of the game he 
went through left guard for thirty 
yards. The game ended twenty-seven 
to six and the happy Tech supporters 
started out to make themselves 
known.
