PITTSBURGH, PA., WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 4, 1911No. 14
MUSICAL CLUB CONCERT
The Glee and Mandolin Clubs gave the first out-oftown concert at Zelienople, Pa., on Tuesday, De
cember 20, 1910. The clubs made the trip on the 
electric interurban Tuesday afternoon, made the 
New 'Hotel Stokey their headquarters, and were 
very well treated by the hotel management. The 
clubs were booked as the chief attraction of the 
Lyceum lecture course and played to a standing 
room only house in the auditorium. Many encores 
and hearty laughter attested the popularity of the 
renditions.
The program was divided into three parts. The 
first part was a straight college glee and mandolin 
club program. The second part revealed a student 
room scene with the quartette in interrupted har
mony, Spanish waltzes by the Mandolin Club and a 
sketch by Mutt and Jeff. Hodgdon played the part 
of Mutt while Jeff found himself championed by John 
Banbury. The sketch was produced in four pictures 
and was well received. The audience was surprised 
and delighted when Jeff strode across the stage in a 
barrel for the fourth picture. Hodgdon, with the aid 
of a putty nose and a scrub moustache and the deft, 
assistance of Moss in making up, presented a clever 
likeness to Bud Fishers creation.
The third part made the real hit. With the audi
torium darkened the curtain arose on an imitation 
bon-fire surrounded by a bunch of fellows dressed in 
loud college garb and posing haphazard about the 
fire in the picturesque attitude generally seen on 
posters and in Ralph D. Paines books. Red electric 
Japanese lanterns helped out the red electric bon fire 
and made the whole scene one of real beauty. The 
scene represented a college campus at night and 
began with the Stein Song i>y the Glee Club. Some
of the men smoked, while others toasted marshmal
lows over the bon fire, just like they do in story 
books. During this scene the Mandolin Club played 
Lion du Bal and Traumerie, while the hit of the 
Glee Club was a Yodel by Crawford and Hodgden. 
Encore after encore proved that the audience had 
caught the spirit of the thing and appreciated the 
efforts of the performers.
After the concert Sgn Scalzo, the Mandolin Club 
director, on the mandolin, accompanied by Brendel 
as a second, Crawford on the tenor lute, and Kukovitch on the guitar, entertained a room full of fel
lows at the hotel until the wee sma hours. Sgn 
Scalzo improvised and composed, exhibiting his won
derful talent in many clever ways, always closely 
followed by Crawford, Bredel and Kukovitch, who 
accompanied him with grace and ease. Crawfords 
repertoire of stunts seems to be inexhaustable and 
while the music was great,it was continually inter
rupted by peals of laughter at Crawfords provoca
tion.
The Clubs struck tent next morning, leaving be
hind not only a good reputation for entertaining 
ability, but also creating a good impression for them
selves, the club and their Alma Mater by their splen
did conduct and faultless manners.
SEORITA. 
Mexican Conceit to be Staged by the White Friars in 
the Near Future.
Seorita is the play which was selected for the 
season of 1911 when the White Friars Dramatic Club 
met Thursday evening, December 15th, 1910. The

---------------------------------------------------

THE TARTAN
play, which is a musical comedy of quite a little 
different type from the plays which have been staged 
by the Friars in the past, is written by Thos. B. 
Don'aldscn of the University of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Donaldson, it will be remembered, was the author of 
All in a Dormitory, the first production ever staged 
by the White Friars. The actual date of the Pitts
burgh performance has not been as yet decided upon. 
However, it is planned to have the play ready for the 
public late in March or early in April.
The play will be put on this year at the Carnegie 
Music Hall. Special scenery, drop-curtains and 
dancing-floor will transform the hall into a very com
fortable theater, equal to the varied demands of a 
college production. Work on the stage accessories 
and equipment is under way now so that nothing 
will hinder the smooth, right-to-the-minute perform
ance which is so necessary to a play of this kind.
The plot of Senorita is laid on the United StatesMexican border line. The dialogue is clean-cut and 
original to the end and holds out excellent oppor
tunities for some very clever character work from 
different persons in the cast. The music, some of 
which has been written by Mr. Donaldson, is char
acteristic and good. The Spanish atmosphere per
vading the play throughout offers excellent excuse 
for some really good dancing and a splendid selec
tion of lyrics, most of which will be written by Mr. 
Donaldson or Mr. Edmundson.
The White Friars will again be coached by Mr. 
W. B. Edmundson, who has been so successful with 
the club during the passed three years. Mr. Wm. 
Drrington will direct the music as in previous years 
and some good work may be expected in that direc
tion. Mr. Donaldson, the author of the play, will 
oversee the production in a general way.
The future is bright and rosy for the Friars at pres
ent. A call will be made for candidates in the near 
future and there is every prospect of a record-break
ing number of men at the try-outs. The show will 
be staged early, several good trips are a certainty 
and all indications point to a very successful season.

SIGMA RHO DANCE.
One of the most brilliant affairs of the season was 
the Second Annual Dance given by the Sigma Rho 
Fraternity. The German Club on Craft avenue, was 
the place; Friday evening, December 16, the eve of 
.he Christmas vacation, was the time. Fifty cou
ples were in attendance. The attractive ball-room 
of the German Club presented a charming appear
ance. Pennants and banners of all descriptions 
added a festive touch. The grand march which was 
started at nine oclock, was a pretty picture. The 
array of beautiful girls, stunningly gowned for the 
occasion, proved to the onlooker a vista of unal
loyed delight. Twenty regular dances and six fra
ternity extras made up the card for the evening. 
Nirellas orchestra out-Nirellaed itself in a splendid 
series of waltzs, two-steps, schottisches and newports, with an occasional varsouBienne or espinitaIto vary the fun. A Paul Jones early in the evening 
destroyed every vestige of restraint which might 
have been felt by those unacquainted. It was 
fast nearing the hour of two when the final plaintive 
Strain of the home waltz murmured a soft goodnight 
to he last weary devotee of Terpsichore. The dance 
which is an annual affair, goes far *- 
fraternitys splendid reputation for hospitality at 
good-fellowship.
INTER CLASS BASKET BALL.
The schedule of the Inter Class League has been 
made out, and play will be commenced on- Monday, 
January 16. Three games a week will be played, 
one on Monday and two on Saturday. The league 
will be composed of teams from each of the three 
lower classes in the Schools of Applied Science and 
Applied Design, and from the two lower classes in 
the School of Applied Industries. Interest in the 
league is running high, and it is expected that many 
exciting games will be played.
Mrs. Edward H. Harriman of New York has given 
$100,000 to Yale University to endow the chair of 
forest management, in the Yale Forest School as 
a memorial to her husband, who was greatly in
terested in forestry work. Her son, William Avery 
Harriman, is a sophomore in the college.

ALUMNI DANCE.
One of the prettiest and most timely affairs of the 
vacation season was the M. M. C.* S. Alumni dance 
which was held in the Athletic Field House, Friday 
evening, December 30th. Although a small crowd 
was present, the affair was attended by the same 
spirit of good-fellowship and entertainment which 
has always characterized Margaret Morrison even
ings. The dance was started at nine oclock and 
continued until the lights went out after midnight. 
The orchestra, of unknown vintage, proved excellent 
and pleased immensely with a catchy line of popular 
dance music. The committee in charge of the af
fair was: Rebecca Schuman, chairman; Sara Wil
liams, Elizabeth Kelly, Catherine Ihmson, Henrietta 
Alcorn. It is understood that the dance is the first 
of a series of dances and parties to be held by the 
Alumni girls.
Oh, Cupid is a naughty elf,
A cheerful little giver;
Who carries bow and arrow sharp,
But makes my heart a-quiver.
Bjust Bjoakann.
The women at Syracuse are to hold a track meet. 
Their practice is held every afternoon on a special 
athletic field. Last year several promising track 
athletes were developed, and the meet formed an im
portant part of the years program.
Of the 325 women students enrolled at Oberlin, 25 
are wholly self-supporting and 54 are partly so.
A hockey game between a team composed of fair 
co-eds of Aberdeen University, Scotland, and a team 
composed of Aberdeen ladies resulted in a defeat for 
the University players, 6 to 4.
VARSITY BASKET BALL.
The varsity basket ball squad has been gradually 
cut down until, at present, only ten men have been 
retained. A team which will probably start the sea
son has been picked, being composed of the fol
lowing men: Forwards, Jordan, R. Williams and Kil
gore; center, Keltz; guards, J. Williams, Du Barry, 
and Mandeville. The team played a practice game 
with the Westinghouse team on Wednesday and 
goes to Allegheny for its first college game on Fri
day. The first game with Pitt will be played at 
the Duquesne Gardens on January 20th.

THE RETURN.
Well! Christmas with all its attendant glory is 
over. Some of us have chosen the charming but in
expensive method of expressing our good will by 
wishing our friends a Merry Christmas and a Happy 
New Year; some of us have found this insufficient 
and have followed the time-honored custom of ex
changing presents, with dire and complicated results.
But, be that as it may, it is a safe wager that we 
have all had a happy and strenuous vacation, and are 
glad to get back to school. School, with all its 
studies, grinds and daily toil, is but a restful occupa
tion compared to some of the vacations we take, 
with the daily ( and nightly) round of parties and 
dances. Looking at it from a philosophical stand
point the average student has much to be thankful 
for. Is not a college (according to his viewpoint) 
primarily a place of recuperation and rest, an insti
tution where the absorption of the tenets of the 
higher education is regarded as a secondary con
sideration? Yea, verily! What atmosphere can be 
more suitable to genuine comfort and rest than the 
environment of the classroom?
With a wad of cotton in each ear nothing could be 
more conducive to undisturbed slumber. What does 
it matter if occasionally ones repose is unnecessarily 
disturbed by an inconsiderate request upon the part 
of a professor that the class go to the board, a 
request which shows a surprising lack of thought
fulness on the part of said professor?
Or, again, when all is going nicely, oh so nicely, 
that a budget of flunk-caids are passed out with a
prodigal hand to the prodigal student? Not a bit. 
Nothing can bother us for a while; its so good to be 
back on the job once more. Even the danger signals, 
advance tremors of the final semester exams wrhich 
will soon be upon us, can not destroy that feeling of 
peace and equanimity which strikes the heart of the 
student upon his return to the rut. As our old 
friend Dismal Smith used to say Ruts are nice 
things, after all. The Tartan wants to get into the 
bandwagon and st'arts a New Year of happiness and 
renewed vigor by offering all its friends the best of 
wishes and the seasons sincerest greetings.
COLLEGE STUDIES AND SUCCESS IN LIFE.
At various times during the last decade some at
tempts have been made to prove that a students 
rank in his college studies is at least a fair index 
of his chances of success in later life, but these in
vestigations often failed to carry conviction because 
the criterion of success which the investigators em
ployed, namely the inclusion of mens names in 
Whos Who 'in America, was widely objected to as 
being faulty or unfair.
An endeavor has therefore been made to secure, 
on a small scale, some criterion which will be per
haps less readily objected to, and with this in view 
the Class of 1894, Harvard, was selected for analysis. 
Dean Briggs, E. H. Wells, 97, and Professor F. E. 
Farrington, 94, of Columbia University, were asked 
to select from this class the names of those men who 
had, during their fifteen years since graduation, 
achieved distinct success, each judge to determine 
for himself his own definition of success. Twentythree members of the class were indicated as success
ful by at least two of the three judges. The exact 
college records of twenty-three of their own class
mates chosen at random. The comparison shows 
many interesting things, but among these none more 
interesting than that which is brought out in the 
appended table. The table shows the total number 
of each of the five grades obtained during their col
lege course by the successful and random groups 
respectively.

The men who have made good during the first fif
teen years out of college are men who made as un
dergraduates nearly four times as many As as the 
average among their classmates. Now there is prob
ably no undergraduate hallucination more persistent 
than that assumes an entire absence of any connec
tion between examination grades and post-collegiate 
success. Yet the fact that there is such connection,

and that it is an intimate one has been established to 
the entire satisfaction of every investigator who has 
approached the subject. If our undergraduates of 
the present generation will scrutinize the foregoing 
table they may find in it some things which seem to 
give a rather rude jolt to one of their pleasant de
lusions.Harvard Alumni Bulletin.

BASKET BALL UNIFORMS.
The uniforms for the basket ball team have been 
on exhibition for the first time Wednesday evening, 
and are a disappointment. The uniform consists of 
a navy blue jersey, with white diagonal stripe, upon 
which the word CARNEGIE is spelled out in small 
plaid letters. The trousers are dark blue, with a 
white stripe. Although the uniforms appear to be 
of good material and workmanship, the design is 
poor and savors too much of Prep School regalia.

The last Class B Plan Projects and the Order 
Problems which were forwarded to the Society of 
Beaux Arts of New York for exhibition and judgment 
were returned December 16th. There were twentysix designs submitted by students in the plan class 
and thirty in the order class. Of this number twenty 
mentions and two first mentions were awarded to 
students in the plan class and twenty-seven mentions 
and one first mention were awarded to students in 
the order class.
The students receiving first mentions were Messrs.
B. Smith, L. A. McMullen and B. M. Powers. The 
subject of the plan project wras An Automobile 
Garage and that of the Order Problem A Driveway 
to a Court.
The second Class A Plan projects, of this year 
were shipped to the Society of Beaux Arts Architects, 
Monday, December the twelfth. There were five de
signs submitted. This design, which was given by 
Messrs. A. D. Hamlin and W. A. Delano, called for a 
Theological Seminary to be located in the suburbs 
of a large city. It was to consist of a large chapel; 
a refectory; a library of about twenty thousand 
volumes, with studies adjoining; a museum; a gym
nasium; a large lecture hall and two smaller halls; 
eight class rooms with professors study adjoining; a 
reception room; residence for the dean; eight apart
ments for professors and a power plant.
There were nine drawings rendered for the Class 
A and B Archaeology problem at the' same time 
as the above.
Both problems showed interest, along with hard 
study and work on the part of each individual. The 
subject of the Archaeology was a A Temple to 
Flora.
Programs for the third Class A Preliminary 
sketch and the Class B Esquisse-Esquisse were is
sued Saturday, December 17th, at 2 P. M.
The subjects of the above were A Reception Room 
for the President and A Cemetery respectively.
The next freehand and modeling judgment will be 
held Wednesday, December 21st.
Although this school remained a week longer than 
the other schools before the Christmas holiday the 
general attitude of the students toward the shorten
ing of the vacation was good. All seemed to be so 
interested in the Beaux Arts problems, due after the
New Year, that they were glad that they were given 
the opportunity to work in the drafting rooms an
other week. This did not interfere with students 
who live a great distance from Pittsburgh, as they 
were given permission to leave school in time to get 
home on the Friday before Christmas. The prob
lems are due January 9th and the week after New 
Years promises to be one of the best and busiest 
Charettes on record.
Mr. Edmund S. Campbell, who was granted a years 
leave of absence, has recently designed an absolutely

Nearly 120 Seniors at Yale have given to the Yale 
News accounts of their expenses at College in their 
Freshman, Sophomore and Junior years. For the 
Freshman year the accounts of 114 men ranged from 
$115 to $2,200, the average being $1,033.48. In the 
Sophomore year 117 men spent sums from $150 to 
$2,850 apiece, the average being $1,001.89. In the 
Junior year 119 men each spent sums ranging from 
$150 to $2,700, and the average was $1,133.50. In 
considering these figures it must be borne in mind 
that they are taken from only a part of the class 
and, therefore, the averages are not absolutely ac
curate.

For all their Hs and their airs,
