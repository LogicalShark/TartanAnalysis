The above schedule for the ap
proaching season is a great improve
ment over that of last years, and 
Manager Miller is to be commended 
for the attractive list of meets he has 
arranged. In addition, the schedule 
is a very difficult one which will keep 
the team hustling to maintain Car
negies good record in track.
There will be but two weeks of 
preliminary training following the 
Easter vacation before the opening of 
the season. This will occur,on April
25 with the annual Interschool meet. 
From then until June, the team will 
be busy every Saturday. The first 
encounter with an outside school will 
take place at Meadville. Allegheny 
College has had unusually successful 
teams in all branches of sport dur
ing the present year and in view of 
their victory over Tech in track last 
season, this meet will be one of the 
hardest on the list.
The following week the Fourth An
nual Interscholastic Meet under 
Techs auspices will be held at the 
Oval in Schenley Park. Each year 
the number of preparatory and high 
schools represented has increased, and 
if present plans materialize, the 1914 
meet will be broader than any pre
vious one in the scope of institutions 
that will be included among the con
testants. While the scholastic stars 
are battling for honors, the Varsity 
will engage in a dual meet with West
minster. From past scores, this 
should result in an easy victory for 
Tech.
The next two Saturdays, we will 
be competing against Pitt. On May 
16, a dual meet is scheduled, the first 
one with our rivals since 1909, when 
the Plaid colors triumphed over the 
Blue and Gold. No matter what the 
outcome this year, the struggle will 
surely be close, for the teams are well 
matched. The following week, the

On March 26, 1914, the Ben Greet 
Players will present at the Carnegie 
Music Hall two of Shakespeares 
plays, under the auspices of the Car
negie Institute of Technology. These 
players are brought to Pittsburgh in 
connection with the work of the new 
Department of Drama in the School 
of Applied Design.
The plays to be presented are As 
You Like It at a matinee 3:30, and 
A Midsummer Nights Dream in the 
evening at 8:15. Ben Greet himself 
will appear in both plays.
The proceeds will be devoted to the 
establishment of a scholarship in the 
School of Drama.
The price of tickets is as follows: 
In the second balcony, 25c for one 
performance and 35c for tickets to 
both performances.
In the first balcony, 50c for one per
formance, and 75c for both perform
ances.
The price of the rear seats on the 
first floor will be the same as for 
first balcony seats.
These tickets may be obtained at 
Mellors or at the Bursars office from 
March 13th to 26th.
The Ben Greet Players are famous 
the world over f.or their production 
of plays of all descriptions from the 
Fifteenth Century to modern bur
lesque, in the theatres and in the open 
air. Ben Greet is considered today 
as the greatest living authority on 
the English drama; he originated the 
School and Open Air Performance 
and has appeared before every uni
versity and college in the United 
States, Canada and England during 
the past twenty-seven years. Exper
ience gained from over three thou
sand open air performances and over 
two thousand indoor performances 
has made these Players the foremost 
company of its kind.
will occur when Pitt Intercollegiate 
Meet with the championship of the 
western part of the state at stake will 
be held. Penn State, W. & J., Alle
gheny, Pitt and Tech are the schools 
likely to be in the running for first 
place.
The season will close with the In
tercollegiate Meet at New Wilming
ton on May 30. Last year Tech won 
handily against Westminster, Grove 
City, and Geneva, and should be able 
to duplicate the performance.

The Fourth Annual Home Concert 
of the Carnegie. Mandolin and Glee 
Clubs passed into history on last 
Friday evening, and will be recorded 
in our annals as one of the most 
successful and enjoyable concerts 
that have been given by the clubs 
since their founding. Furthermore, 
the concert fully bore out the rumors 
that have been so current around 
school this year to the effect that our 
Clubs can be ranked on a par with 
any to be found in the country. The 
evidence of the popularity and inter
est of the students in the concert can 
be found in the fact that the attend
ance was the largest in the history 
of the Home Concerts being in the 
neighborhood of fifteen hundred.
The best presentations given by 
the clubs were the Song of the Vik
ings and Autumn Winds by the 
Glee Club, and Aubade Printaniere 
and the Wedding of the Winds by 
the Mandolin Clubs. A piano solo 
with two encores rendered by Mr. A.
H. Shutz was one of the treats of 
the evening. The skill and technique 
exhibited by Mr. Shutz stamps him 
as being a performer of the rarest 
ability and a most valuable asset of 
the Clubs. The vocal solo given by 
Mr. McNulty who by the way is one 
of the Plebes on the clubs, gives rise 
to the hope that in him we will find 
a successor to Bob Crawford. Sig
nor Scalzo played a mandolin solo 
by request. It probably will suffice 
to say that Signor Scalzos reputation 
makes no comment necessary.
As usual the Octette, which has 
gained a reputation for itself in past 
years, was present, furnishing a great 
deal of laughter and amusement for 
the audience. Their Celophone was 
an entirely new idea, representing a 
xylophone, the notes of which were 
taken by members of the Glee Club, 
and presided over by Gaylord in his 
usual grave and dignified manner. Mr. 
M. F. Woods caused much laughter 
by giving a solo with two encores on 
an instrument invented by him espe
cially for the occasion, known as the 
Umbrelophone. It consisted of a 
single string fastened from the tip 
of an umbrella to the end of the han
dle. This instrument was played in 
the same manner as a violin, emmitting a quality of tone that was exContinued on Page 5
Although beaten in the final game 
of the season by Allegheny on Satur
day night, March 14, on the Field 
House floor, the Varsity covered 
themselves with glory. The (game 
which ended 44 to 33, wras the best 
seen on the home floor this season. 
Allegheny has one of the best teams 
in the district and they showed it in 
Saturday nights contest. The game 
was much closer than the score in
dicates, and the visitors came out 
ahead as the result of phenomenal 
shooting. In passing and floor work 
they were outplayed, but the home 
team failed to ipake good on all of 
its shots, and were left on the smaller 
end.
A new combination, with Hines 
at forward and Savage at guard, was 
tried, and worked well. Hines was 
probably the star, as he was the first 
man to score on Graham, the Alle
gheny guard, this season, caging two 
baskets. Levy also did good work, 
filling the position of center better 
than in any previous game. Savage 
again played well, and Criswell and 
Douthett put up their usual stellar 
performance with a little bit added.
Bash scored a field goal first, then 
Criswell, after missing a shot, caged 
a foul. Allegheny ran the score to 
seven, before Criswell had another 
free shot. Hines caged a long shot, 
and Criswell made it 5 points from 
the line. Levy scored a field goal 
after Cox had shot a foul and the 
score stood 7 to 8. Cox shot a field 
goal, but Crissy tied the score at 10 
with a free throw and a basket. A 
foul by either side made it 11 all, and 
then a double foul tied the score at
12. Criswell shot a field goal, giving 
our team a lead of one point, over a 
foul by Allegheny. When our team 
reached 17, Allegheny again tied. A 
moment later they were ahead 19 to 
18 but the half ended in a tie 20 to 
20. Allegheny jumped ahead three 
points at the start, but Carnegie 
caught up later. Douthett shot a 
sensational basket from the middle of 
the floor and tied the score at 30. 
Slowly, but surely, the big visitors 
wore down the lighter Plaid team 
and on a succession of almost impos
sible shots drew ahead. Four field 
goals were shot in the last five min
utes and the final score gave them

PlRVICIPlVION IN 
lCVIVIVIoS.
We were greatly interested to learn 
recently that at Ohio State Universi
ty 101 out of 505 student officials had 
been declared ineligible because of 
new rules regarding scholarship re
quirements. It seems that at this 
University rather stringent rules have 
been adopted by the faculty with ref
erence to scholarship, one of them 
being that after a condition has been 
placed on a students record card for 
24 hours, his office becomes vacant 
He must then remove his condition 
before again becoming a candidate 
for the office which he previously 
held, and in order to be re-elected he 
must meet other candidates for the 
office on a competitive basis as in the 
original election. The application of 
this eligibility rule has caused sev
eral complications. For instance, the 
Editor of the year book has been de
prived of his office, and it has been 
recommended to the council that the 
business manager of the board as
sume the responsibility for both po
sitions. Three members of the stud
ent council were made ineligible, and 
every office in the Freshman class, 
with the exception of one, was va
cated.
The students at Ohio State seem 
considerably wrought up over the re
sult of the new ruling. The Editor 
of the paper wonders how far the 
pendulum is going to swing in the 
direction of absolute disintegration 
of student activities before a sane 
reaction sets in. The rule, he says, 
is working towards the destruction of 
all wholesome college institutions.
So much for the immediate results.
But what is the deeper significance? 
Do activities take up so much of a 
students time that he has none left 
for the more serious object of his 
life at college? Does the fact that 
one out of every five student officers 
cannot measure up to scholarship re
quirements, mean that participation 
in school activities causes a disregard 
for the real purpose of a college train
ing? W"e hope not. We believe ab
solutely in scholarship requirements. 
The primary object of a college train
ing is educational; the activity side of 
university life, though quite import
ant, is secondary.
The rule at Ohio State may seem 
more stringent than necessary, but 
probably the faculty there are in a 
position competently to judge. Per
haps there has sprung up among the 
students a feeling that scholarship is 
not essential, that by participating in 
activities and thereby gaming the 
wholesome benefits of college inter
ests, they are reaping the main ad
vantage of their course. Such a con
dition would be unfortunate, in any 
school, and we hope it will never arise 
at Carnegie.
We cannot praise student activity 
too highly, but we do not place it 
above scholastic standing. On all 
occasions, the latter must come first, 
and every man here in school should 
realize that fact. We know how 
easy it is to go to excess in anything, 
and especially in the matter of stud
ent activities. The interests of ac
tivities are so absorbing, the inti
mate relations with other men in their 
achievement of a common ambition 
for a better school spirit so engross
ing, that this danger is ever present. 
We trust that the students here, re
membering the results at Ohio State, 
will think this matter over, and be 
careful.

An excellent opportunity is offered 
the students of Carnegie to see The 
Ben Greet Players next Thursday 
afternoon and evening in their pre
sentation of As You Like It and 
A Midsummer Nights Dream. The 
proceeds of these plays are to be de
voted to a scholarship in the School 
of Applied Design, Department of 
Drama, and it is hoped that every 
student will support the same.
Since their establishment in Eng
land in 1887, the Ben Greet Players 
have made for themselves an envi
able reputation both as producers of 
Shakespearean plays and in more 
modern burlesques. They have ap
peared before practically every uni
versity and college in this country, 
as well as in England and in Canada.
Inasmuch as these Players have be
come the foremost company of this 
nature in the world, every student 
should avail himself of this opportun
ity to hear them at greatly reduced 
prices.
VHo HO.o CONCoRV.
The annual Home Concert has be
come history. We wish to congratu
late the class upon their excellent at
tainments. The Club is one of the 
best ways for advertising Carnegie. 
The comments from the newspapers of 
the towns in which the clubs perform 
have always been most praisworthy.
The Concert as given last Friday was 
similar to the former concerts. We 
readily understand that it is hard to 
have new features, but the ones pre
sented were very good. The Mandolin 
Club presented their selections better 
than any club of former years. The 
Glee Club did not render their pro
gram as in previous years. What was 
lacking in talent, however, was made 
up in spirit and training.

A suggestion has recently come to 
us that some of the students might 
be sufficiently interested in dancing 
and especially in the new dances, to 
wish to engage an instructor and hold 
dancing classes, say at noons. It 
might be possible to secure the Gym
nasium floor for this purpose, and if 
sufficient men are interested in this 
proposition, it might work quite suc
cessfully. It is quite true that there 
are a number of men here in school 
who do not know how to dance, and 
who would perhaps be glad of the 
opportunity which might be thus af
forded.

The Varsity had little trouble beat
ing Bethany 41 to 25 on Saturday, 
March 7, on the home floor. The 
first half was slow and poorly played, 
but the second part was more lively 
and our team showed some of the 
ability that they have owned.
Bethany took the lead early and 
had an easy time in the first ten min
utes. Luckily, they were not able to 
run up a big score and the best they 
could do was to get an advantage of 
five points. The half ended 16 to 14 
in their favor.
In the second half, our five took 
a brace and the lead, soon running 
up to 30 to 18. This lead was steadily 
increased until the final whistle.
Criswell played the best game, 
while Hines and Douthett also showed 
up well. Henning played with more 
life than usual and appeared to ad
vantage.

After Saturday nights game with 
Allegheny, the members of the Var
sity basketball team elected James P. 
Tumpane, forward on the team, to be 
their captain for the season of 1914-
15. Tumpane is a Junior in the Com
mercial Engineering course in the 
School of Applied Science and has 
played on the Varsity team two years. 
In these two seasons he has led the 
team in shooting field goals and has 
been one of the fastest and most valu
able workers on the team. The men 
have every confidence in him and he 
should make a successful leader. The 
Tartan joins the many other friends 
of Tumpane in wishing him and his 
team a successful season with a long 
list of victories.
We also wish to congratulate Cap
tain Criswell and the 1914 team on the 
season just ended, eight of the fifteen 
collegiate games went to the winning 
side of the record sheet and all of the 
other games were well-played, most 
being lost by low scores. Injuries to 
valuable members of the team, among 
them Criswell, proved contributing 
causes to most of the defeats, while 
the arrangement of hard games on the 
schedule was found to have been to 
our disadvantage. Considering these 
causes and the results, the season may 
certainly be pronounced a success.

DR. Hl.oRSCHLlGS VIoWS 
ON INDUSVRIlL oDUClVION.
(Editorial Note: A Royal Com
mission was appointed in Canada in 
1913 to investigate conditions of in
dustrial training and technical educa
tion throughout Germany, England, 
and the United States. In their re
port recently published they quote 
Director Hamerschlag to quite an ex
tent, and we thought it would be in
teresting to the students here if we 
made excerpts from the report, giv
ing the Directors views on vocational 
training as developed in the School 
of Applied Industries at the Carnegie 
Institute of Technology.)
Dr. Hamerschlag considers that 
the period of adolescence is too early 
a stage, physical and mental, for the 
child to determine with wisdom its 
natural aptitudes, but he is very much 
concerned that children even sooner 
than 14 shall secure something be
sides mere book-learning. They need 
development of the m'otor centers, 
the activity nerves, which can only 
come from play and work. If that 
play can be made educational, that is, 
stimulating to those nerve centers, it 
makes the material capable of intel
lectual fertilization when they go 
through their adolescent period. The 
ideal system in Dr. Hamerschlags 
opinion is the one which offers to 
the greatest number of children the 
greatest number of elective methods 
of expressing themselves through 
work.
Dr. Hamerschlag defined the dif
ference between work and education 
by saying that the thing a child is 
compelled to do, which is induced 
by things outside of himself, is usu
ally waste, educationally; but if he 
craves work it is educational. If he 
has to work it may be wasted as far 
as his educational growth is concern
ed; for it may b% distasteful, and the 
feaction may be so strong within the 
child, that psychologically it hurts 
him. . . . We cannot run education 
for the experfs; it must be for the 
benefit of the great mass of the peo
ple, whether it be an institution for 
research or one for leadership. It 
must be for the mass, because out 
of the mass springs the individual 
who becomes the leader.
When asked whether it would be 
a good thing to differentiate the 
course of training as early as 12, and 
give some manipulative training to 
those boys who go through the High 
School as well as to those who may 
be compelled to leave school at 14 
and earn their living at hand labor. 
Dr. Hamerschlag replied that the one 
who is going on to the university 
should not be deprived of hand work, 
but ought rather to have an over-dose 
of it to properly balance things. He 
believes that it is better to allow hand 
work to bear its proper proportion 
all through, and take it as a part of 
the educative nerve formation of the
child or the man.
With reference to the value of gen
eral cultural training along with in
dustrial training, Dr. Hamerschlag 
stated that he believed the students 
in the Industries School did much 
better work than those of whom he 
had had charge in the New York 
Trade School for a dozen years. The 
reason, he stated, was that the stud
ents here were mentally stimulated 
as well as intensively skilled, and 
the skill came automatically when 
once the inspiration, the love of 
doing the best, was properly estab
lished in the man.
By co-operation between the 
Trades Union, through its education 
committees, and the manufacturers 
through the night classes and Satur
day employment the student gets 
plenty of opportunity for work lead
ing to skill. We are absolutely free 
to handle the educational proposition 
as experts; the manufacturer is 
equally free to handle his individuals 
as working units; and the outside as
sociations of labor men must recog
nize the value of this as a competing 
force. We are unrestricted and I be
lieve the great essential thing for any 
educator is to have a free field and 
no favor to anyone except the indi
vidual, because our product must be 
the man. . . . This institution and 
others have to help the working man 
get his position properly asserted, and 
see that the community gives merit, 
skill and ability their reward. The 
ideal system would be, where com
pelling necessity puts a child into the 
harness at 14, to also compel the user 
of the labor of that unformed, unde
veloped man, to contribute something 
to his educational stimulus; he must 
not be deprived at that adolescent 
period of some chance to form him
selfto resent, if you will, this hard, 
atrophying, terrible work.
Dr. Hamerschlag further says that 
he believes workmen will devote 
themselves systematically two even
ings a week to some sort of civic as 
well as industrial culture, and states 
that the journeyman who comes to 
the School of Applied Industries 
does not come for shop work, nor 
to be taught in another fashion the 
things he already knows. He comes 
here to get something supplementary 
to itlargely, because he craves in
stitutional activity. He wants to be 
a member of the Glee Club, or to be 
with the students or wants to be a 
force in the city, and he wants a 
kind of combination of education and 
club. ... In their study of civics the 
boys study the development of the 
Trades Union movement, study the 
philosophy of industrial economics, 
discuss the piece system, the output 
system, the wage system, etc. By 
putting these live topics before the 
fellows for discussion, we believe we 
can open their minds. It is an inter
esting thing to notice sometimes the 
reactive forces which take place; a 
man who is arguing in favor of one 
condition finally gets into a place 
where he is arguing on the other side. 
We have had some very interesting 
experiences in that direction.

On Friday, March 13, Dr. Ernest 
Thompson Seton delivered a lecture 
to the students of the Womens 
School on Wild Animals at Home. 
The lecture was exceedingly interest
ing and it is given in substance be
low:
Most every one is interested in 
living things, particularly in animals, 
and as all animals are wild first the 
interest in wild animals is deeprooted.
Whenever an animal goes it leaves 
a written history, not in writing as 
we commonly speak, of history today 
but by the marks that it leaves in 
passing over the ground. There are 
far more animals that we imagine 
and it rarely happens that the entire 
foot is written in the mud or snow. 
Usually the hind feet make deeper 
marks and are ahead of the marks 
made by the front feet. In the tracks 
left by the rabbit one front froot is 
usually behind the other, while the 
squirrel strikes the ground evenly. 
The quail walks; the blue bird hops 
with feet together; the robbin some 
times hops and sometimes walks, 
showing that he lives in a tree and 
in the air. The crow has a long 
hind toe; the turkey has a short hind 
toe. The dog goes straight towards 
an object and drags his toes, show
ing that he is civilized, while the wolf 
makes a wide circle gradually draw
ing near the object for inspection and 
he always puts his hind feet in the 
same places as the front feet have 
been.
It is almost impossible to take a 
perfect track with photography as it 
does not show up depth, but finally 
the solution was presented when a 
man living in NewT York had a coon 
which he kept locked up in his apart
ments during the day while he was 
at his office. One day the coon got 
loose and started out to investigate 
she apartment by himself. After 
playing with various things he found 
a huge bottle on a shelf, so he re
moved the top, smelt it but did not 
recognize the odor so tipped the bot
tle over and let the ink which was 
inside drop down on the desk. He 
went to the pool, smelt it, tasted it, 
put his feet in it, but could discover 
no use for it, so started away, as he 
did so he discovered that it made 
black marks, so proceeded to cover 
the papers and books on the desk. He 
then started to cover the walls and 
after covering them nicely he decided 
to take a rest and laid down on the 
bed. He discovered that this was a 
wonderful place to make marks and 
had just finished his work when the 
landlady came in. The owner was 
called and the coon was taken to the 
office. This, led to the new way of 
getting tracks of the animals, and 
from that day to this most of the
tracks studied and used in homes and 
liDraries have been made by having 
the animal first walk over a sheet 
covered with fresh ink, then over a 
clean sheet of paper.
Last summer when Dr. Seton was 
in Yellowstone there was a dog in 
the party named Chinks who fur
nished a great deal of amusement for 
the entire party. For instance he 
tried all summer to catch one of the 
little ground squirrels who burrow 
their homes into the ground then sit 
on top of the hole and when they see 
anything coming near it straighten up 
until they look like little soldiers. 
Then just as you make the final rush 
they jump into their holes. Chink 
tried all summer to catch one of these 
little animals but the only one he 
caught was a little stuffed one.
Then one day one of the men saw 
a fox about fifty feet away, so sent 
Chink to chase him. It was a funny 
chase as the fox was not running 
hard while Chink was going as fast 
as possible, and barking at the top of 
his lungs. Finally the fox turned and 
started after poor Chink. Then it be
came the usual thing for the fox to 
follow the party just out of reach of 
the whips and tease Chink.
The owner of Chink then left the 
party and took the dog with him into 
the mountains. After he had estab
lished the tent and provisions he told 
Chink to stand guard and he went to 
the postoffice about twenty miles 
away where he got drunk and so 
stayed three days. Finally he started 
back and as he began to get sober 
back and as he began to get sober he 
remembered the long distance to his 
tent so he rode faster. When he came 
in sight of his tent he saw the fox only 
a few' feet from the tent door and 
Chink making his final stand. Upon 
going into the tent he found that his 
provisions had not been touched and 
realized that Chink had not had a 
thing to eat or drink for three days 
because the fox had been advancing, 
so the master took down his gun
which was sealed when he entered 
the park and he shot the fox. Some 
soldiers heard the report and ordered 
him out of the reservation and took 
his gun, but he said that it had taught 
him a lesson that an animal could be 
trusted more than a man.
All kinds of devices have been tried 
to have an animal come out its home 
but whistling will usually do it. One 
man found that while he could get a 
little mountain squirrel out, he could 
get near and get various poses by
whistling Yankee Doodle, so when
Dr. Seton was in Canada he tried 
this but the squirrel ran into its hole 
and then he tried God Save the 
King, which brought the squirrel out 
again.
Then one day a party saw a heron 
and by its cry they knew they were 
near its nest, so tried to find it. They 
succeeded but could not get the bird 
to alight on it so they placed the 
camera and strung the rubber tube 
seventy feet and attached a bicycle 
pump at the end. Then when the 
bird had disappeared from sight

among the reeds they snapped the 
camera and obtained a beautiful pic
ture. They also got pictures of it 
with its young and of the young birds 
by themselves.
In Yellowstone Park is a little tame 
bear named Tony who picked up Dr. 
Setons acquaintanceship. One morn
ing Dr. Seton looked out his window 
and saw Tony up a little willow tree 
which was bent almost double and 
coming toward it was a great big bear. 
Dr. Seton went down stairs and 
thought he would try and get a pic
ture when it was near so he snapped 
the camera when the big bear was 
about eight feet away, but while he 
was steady and not afraid the land
scape was so the picture was not 
very good.
All animals talk in a sense but they 
do not have such a large vocabulary 
as human beings, instead they have a 
few simple sounds by which they can 
tell each other of approaching danger, 
etc., for example, the elk in the fall 
has a wonderful call which is very 
loud and sounds as if he was saying 
Does anybody want to fight. After 
doing this a few times an answer is 
usually heard saying, I want to 
flight. Then when they meet there 
is such a noise that it can be heard 
for a great distance. Sometimes they 
fight in groups and one night Dr. 
Seton reached the ground just as it 
was finished. Two elks were playing

A timely lecture on Panama was 
given by Prof. W. F. Mott at the 
weekly meeting o the Assembly of 
The School of Applied Industries last 
Wednesday. The talk was illustrated 
and the only regret was that more 
time could not be devoted to the in
teresting subjects.
Previous to the lecture President J. 
R. Price took the chair and presided 
over his first session of the Assembly. 
After a short address he introduced 
several speakers who spoke on mat
ter of student interest. Mr. McCulloch spoke on Spring Training for 
Football and urged the men to re
port for practice when the signal is 
given. Track Manager Miller spoke 
on Track Athletics and called for 
candidates for the spring meet. Ran
dal announced the minstrel rehearsal 
and Monhs invited the fellows to hear 
Ernest Thompson Seaton on Boy 
Scout Work. A special feature was 
singing of the Industrial Quartette, 
consisting of Messrs. Vey, Price, 
Nauman and Simboli.

while two more were fencing and the 
other two were fighting to the finish. 
The elk fight with their antlers which 
they grow new each spring. It takes 
about four months before they are full 
grown.
The wolf is an uncivilized dog who 
obtains his living by the chase and he 
has a wonderful hunting call. One 
night when Dr. Seton was in Wash
ington, D. C., he went to the museum 
and started the hunting call to find 
out if any of the wolfs there had for
gotten the call. Gradually it was 
answered, first by one and then by 
another until the entire pack were 
giving the hunting song. After it 
had reached its heights they seemed 
to realize that their hunting days were 
over so went back rather slowly to 
their beds.
The lecture was illustrated by pic
tures and by Dr. Seton imitating the 
various wild animals.

Following the concert, the Fourth 
Annual Dance of the Musical Clubs 
was held in the Hotel Schenley. The 
original program, which consisted of 
twenty dances, was shortened owing 
to the lateness of the hour. The music 
for the dancing was furnished by

RlDIO CLUB .ooVING.
Last Thursday evening at 5 P. M. 
in Room 209 Science, an important 
meeting of the Radio Club was held. 
A rearrangement of the due system 
was made so that the dues are now 
ten cents per week, and no person 
may join the club next year until he 
has paid all back dues in full.
The work on the wireless apparatus 
is going right ahead, the transformer 
is well on its way to completion, and 
the next thing to do is to secure per
mission from Mr. Cunningham of the 
Carnegie Institute, to put the arial 
on the chimney of the Library power 
house. The plan is to stretch it 
across the railroad between the two 
chimneys of Machinery Hall and the 
Institute. On the latter a special 
form of fastener has to be devised; 
for this each member is to draw up 
a design and the best one will be 
used. The University of Michigan 
has an aerial similar to the proposed 
one. The tower room1 in Machinery 
Hall will likely be used for the new 
Radio club rooms and Professor 
Wurtz has kindly offered his aid and 
assistance in supplying the room with 
the necessary power for the wireless 
outfit.

Cox starred for the visitors. The 
speedy forward is either a superhu
man shot or was especially favored 
by the fickle goddess on this night, 
for almost every one of his attempts 
was successful. They were all started 
from long distances or difficult angles, 
but made good. Nichols also played 
well in the second half.
Throughout the game was fast and

60% artatt
To the Editor of The Tartan:
In accordance with your wishes, I 
hasten to present to you as succintly 
as possible one of the new ideas put 
in operation this year by the Depart
ment of Students Health and the 
reasons which prompted it.
As all of your readers know, a fair 
percentage of the students at the Car
negie Institute of Technology work 
their way through school either en
tirely or partly. The time demanded 
by their studies both at the Institu
tion and at home leaves them Satur
day and a few hours during the week 
between 5 and 7 to earn their living. 
The compensation for this work is 
necessarily small while the cost of 
living already very high increases 
yearly. Unfortunately, also, the hu
man machine demands fuel, be its 
cost high or low and demands it 
doubly for youths who are still in the 
formative period, are physically ener
getic and must be, mentally, active 
and alert.
Energy, activity, alertness, pre
suppose a harmonious equilibrium of 
the whole organism a frictionless run
ning of its different parts, enduring a 
resistance and a nervous energy sus
ceptible of meeting all reasonable de
mands.
How can this be secured on a lim
ited income of let us say $4.50 a week, 
two dollars of which will go for lodg
ings and laundry?
In my estimation, only through 
careful selection, purchase and intelli
gent dispensing of food stuffs. Let 
me illustrate these points.
There is a legion of breakfast foods 
on the market. Some predigested, 
some requiring cooking. They are all 
cereal preparations furnished by eith
er wheat, corn, oats, rice, but they 
are not especially advantageous or 
nutritious.
A cupful of rolled oats thoroughly 
cooked for hours will yield more heat, 
will furnish more substances to repair 
tissue waste than one shredded wheat 
biscuit, for example, which would 
weigh 30 grammes and cost as much 
as the cup of oatmeal. True, one 
demands time and care and fuel, the 
other not.
Again, a pound of butter at 45 cents 
yields 3600 calories.
Again, a pound of oleomargarine 
at 25 cents yields 3525 calories.
Again, a pound of peanut butter at 
15 cents yields 2825 calories.
Both butter and oleomargarine con
tain 84% of fats, no carbohydrates, 
and a negligible amount of Protein, 
(about 1 per cent). 
Peanut butter contains only 46.5 per 
cent of fat, but on the other hand it 
contains 29 per cent of protein, 17 
per cent of carbohyodrates, lastly.
Forty-five cents worth of peanut 
butter furnish 8475 calories, while 45 
cents worth of oleomargarine furnish 
5945 calories, and 45 cents worth of 
creamery butter furnish only 3600 
calories.
Here it may be objected that theo
retical considerations do not hold in 
practice, that whereas it is true that 
45 cents purchase 2.4 times the quan
tity of fuel the assimilation by the 
body is faulty and may be danger
ous.
If we judge by the results of exper
iments made possible by the praise
worthy co-operation of some fifty 
students of the present Plebe Class, 
theory and practice are, in this case, 
in perfect accord. On carefully  se
lected, purchased and intelligently 
dispensed foods, those students have 
gained in weight (from 17 to 4 
pounds) their health has been excel
lent, their resistance, their scholastic 
achievements, of the best.
What sacrifices have been demand
ed to make those results possible?
Co-operation: Living in groups of
4 in 2 separate rooms whenever pos
sible. Purchasing of all food stuffs 
and their preparation in fireless cook
ers. Adoption of a system of living 
with Regularity as the keynote.
Breakfast at 7:30. Lunch at 12. 
Dinner at 6.
Rest of 20 minutes, walk of 40 min
utes, work from 8 to 11. Sleep 8 
hours. Such has been the daily rou
tine of those students who through 
curiosity, or choice, or necessity, have 
adopted the plan and, as we believe, 
made history for the school. They 
have proven, in so far as the experi
ments have progressed (5 months) 
that with a weekly capital of $10 per 
week two meals per day could be pur
chased and cooked for about 11 cents 
per student and that there was left 
on the permissible expense of 36 
cents per day per student, 25 cents 
which could be utilized for purchas
ing one meal a day at the school res
taurant. They have had the privilege 
of ingesting 10 ounces of meat per 
day (a necessity for their age) pos
sibly one third more than some of 
their more well to do schoolmates 
living in boarding houses or restaur
ants could boast of.
How could they do it? Because 
their $10 actually purchased $10 worth 
of food; because there was no ex
pense for cooking (1 cent of gas per 
day being amply sufficient for their 
fireless cookery) because there was 
no expense for service, because there 
was no waste. Their menus, their 
instruction under Miss C. L. Lyon, 
head of the Department of Household 
Economics at the M. M. C. S., enabled 
them to prepare only the actually 
necessary food to be nourished and 
ready not only to meet the daily needs 
but also, to add day by day to their 
reserve stock.
There has been no magic in the 
process; application of well known 
facts, some common sense, a lot of 
enthusiasm and a great deal of good 
will on the part of the initiators of 
the movement and of the student 
body. But, with all the enthusiasm 
and good will imaginable, the plan 
would certainly have fallen short of 
its possibilities, had it not been for 
the admirable devotion of Miss Lyon 
who voluntarily contributed 4 hours 
of her time a week (Thursday and 
Fridays from 5 to 7 for a whole sem
ester) and explained and demonstrat
ed the principles of cooking to inter
ested students as well as furnishing 
valuable information in the prepara
tion of the menus. If the idea orig
inated in other quarters, too much 
credit and gratitude cannot be given 
Miss Lyon for the possibility of its 
execution.
Yours sincerely,
E. ESQUERRE.

Grove City won a slow, featureless 
game on their own floor on March 6, 
the final score being 20 to 17. The 
Carnegie Varsity could not get start
ed and were never going at the speed 
at which they usually travel.
The first half ended with the score 
9 to 8 in favor of the home team, 
but six of our eight points had been 
made on fouls. Douthett scored the 
only field goal. Grove City tallied 
from the floor four times in this half 
and from the foul line but once.
The second half was a repetition of 
the first. Our forwards failed to get 
away from their guards and did not 
score a field goal. The guards were 
the only Tech players to get around 
on the floor and the field goals re
sulted.
Grove City played much as they 
did earlier in the season on our floor, 
and should have been beaten easily 
had our five been playing to form.

Diary of a Sealing oxpedition.
March 5, 1906.
Out of bed, 5 o'clock this morning. 
S. W. wind indicating rain. Letter 
received from my old friend, the Chief. 
Very fortunate, now I shall experience 
some of the mysteries of this excit
ing industry. I would be nowhere 
were it not for a mothers tactful man
agement. Something to eat and good
bye said. Train leaves at 2:30 p. m., 
which shall bring us to the old city 
of St. Johns. Very interesting jour
ney. Many tales were told of hair 
breadth escapes. After a tedious run 
of six hours, arrived at destination. 
9 p. m., reported to chief. Had sup
per at cousins home; met an old 
teacher of younger days.
March 6.Wind, N. W. Very cold; 
took a long walk around the city 
which looks as if an army had entered 
it, only no army can boast of such 
sturdy specimens of manhood. 4:30 
p. m., signed articles. Berth fitted up, 
and made comfortable, sleeping 
aboard tonight.
March 9.Wind, W. N. W. 20 de
grees above zero. Started in 7:00 a. 
m., overhauling engines. Governor 
MacGregor visited the ship at 4:00 p. 
m. Men all lined up to receive him. 
Notice posted Vanguard leaving at 
4:30 p. m. This proved to be a ruse 
to get the crew aboard, thus prevent
ing delay by men imbibing liquor, and 
spending time in lockup. Sailed at 
8:30 p. m., beautiful moonlight. Wind 
W. Air soft and balmy. To the accom
paniment of a flute, the men are sing
ing a chantel while hauling in the

March 8.Wind, W. N. W. Watch 
ended at 4 a. m. Ate a chunk of cake 
and turned in to enjoy the best four

Arrived at Wesleyville, our Northern 
port, of clearance at 10:00 a. m. After 
a speedy run of twelve hours, off duty 
at noon. Dinner, ah; I am ready for 
it. Fresh beef, corned beef, potatoes, 
turnips and plum duff. Best I have 
ever enjoyed. My sympathy is with 
those afflicted with Mal-de-mer. 1:00 
p. m., walked down ashore on harbor 
ice, being about three feet thick. There 
are now seven steamers in port with 
steam up ready for a dash when the 
close time expires. Tempered some 
necessary tools at a Smithy and the 
fun I had here is better imagined than 
described. Back for supper at 5:30 
p. m. Aid very soft, snow deep.

ING .ILL oNGINo.
The Industrial World of Feb. 16, 
1914, contains an article on the test
ing of the new twin tandem compound 
reversing engine driving a 44-inch
blooming mill at the plant of the
Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co.
Th.e test was run on Nov. 28th and
29th, 1913, by engineers of the
Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co., The 
Carnegie Steel Co., the Western Ma
chine Co., and professors and stud
ents of the senior class in steel works 
course of the Carnegie Institute of 
Technology.
This engine, built by the Mesta 
Machine Co. of Pittsburgh, is a 46x76x 
60-in. engine operating condensing mill 
an average vacuum of 27 inches of 
mercury.
The test was run to determine:
1. Steam consumption per indicat
ed horse power hour.
2. Steam consumption per ton of 
steel for various elongations.
3. Work required to roll steel 
under existing conditions.
4. Quickness of reversal.
The steam consumption per I. H. P. 
hour was found to be between 20 and 
22 pounds. This is very low as the 
steam consumption for most Amer
ican reversing engines operating con
densing is about 30 pounds.
The average time for reversal from 
60 R. P. M. in one direction to 20 
R. P. M. in the other direction was
2 2-10 seconds.
The test required elaborate prepar
ations and the obtaining of the best 
data required 16 observers8 at the 
continuous indicators, 3 on the pul
pit; 2 for observing temperatures, 2 
for observing elongations of the 
bloom, and one for condenser meas
urements.
Two similar engines have recently 
been installed at the Gary plant of 
the U. S. Steel Corporation. These 
engines are 44x76x60 inches.
The remarkable steam economy of 
these engines is attributed to the de
sign of the controlling apparatus. 
There is only one controlling lever, 
which through a relay valve operates 
both the reversing links and throttle.

The indoor practice of the Varsity 
baseball team is in its second week 
and the work is beginning to show its 
effects on the men. Forty candidates 
have enrolled and are reporting for 
practice and Coach McCulloch has his 
hands full with the preliminary in
struction of the bunch. The work so 
far has been confined to throwing and 
catching the sphere, and fielding fungoes. No attempt will be made to 
classify the men or to reduce the squad 
until the field dries off and the players 
can start out-door work.
The first game, with Pitt, is now less 
than a month away, and the men are 
anxious to get down to hard work, but 
the light indoor training will do much 
to prepane them and prevent sore 
arms. It is expected that at least two 
weeks of field practice will be allowed 
by the weather before the season 
opens.
It is certain that Hall cannot play 
this year, and an attempt is being made 
to have another captain elected. As 
most of last years men are out of 
school, there has been some delay, but 
it is hoped that a leader will be named 
within the next week. The disqualifi
cation of Hall has reduced the number 
of veterans to an unusually low mark. 
Brine, DeMuth, Hines, Urquhart, Lain, 
and Kirk are all that are left of last 
years letter men, which means that 
almost an entire new field must be 
developed. Hines and Urquhart form 
a good nucleus for the pitching squad 
and with the new material that has 
reported the hurling should be well 
taken care of. Lain is one of the best 
catchers we have had and he is due 
for even a better year than he had last 
season. If Fulmer reports, the back
stop will be occupied, especially as a 
new man is reported to have a good 
rep. Humphries, Kreider, and De
Muth have proved valuable in the out
field and should help start the squad 
of outfielders even if Kirk should jump 
to the track squad, as it is hoped he

We have classified our advertisers so that our readers may use the list 
for reference before making purchases. The grouping furnishes an excellent 
variety of merchants for any article which a student, alumnus or faculty 
member would be likely to buy, and there is no valid reason of which we are 
aware that would justify anyone interested in the welfare of The Tartan in 
making purchases from any but merchants who so kindly make such a publi
cation possible. Be sure, also, to give one of the purchase stubs, which you 
will find enclosed in your Tartan every other week, to the clerk from whom 
you make the purchase. The stubs, we have found, make pleased advertisers 
and help to get new ones. May we depend upon YOU to take this as a re

The Varsity won a fast game from 
Geneva on Thursday night, March 12, 
by the score of 40 to 28. Carnegie 
took an early lead and kept ahead all 
of the way, allowing the vistors to 
come close but once, in the second 
half.
Criswell started the scoring with 
two fouls and Levy made the first 
field goal. Dodds missed two fouls, 
then Criswell, after missing one, made 
the score five to nothing from the 
foul line. Dodds scored the first field 
goal for the Beaver .Fall? team, then 
Tech increased the lead to 12 to 3, 
The home team slowed up and the 
half ended 19 to 13.
In the second half the team fed 
the ball to Criswell with good pass
ing and ran up to 32 to 22. Geneva 
took a spurt and cut the lead to 7 
points, but their run was spoiled and 
the game ended 40 to 28.
Savage entered the game when 
Douthett was withdrawn on account 
of an injury, and the new guard play
ed a very creditable game. Criswell
and Hines played their usual good 
game.
