VARSILi MEETS 
FIRST DEFEAT
Plaid Warriors Fight Gamely.Won
derful Exhibition of Spirit on Part 
of Te chi tes.
Forbes Field was the scene of the 
Plaids first defeat of the season. The 
visitors were amply repaid by wit
nessing this interesting exhibition 
of real football and the plucky re
sistance of the much lighter Tech ag
gregation. The largest crowd that 
had yet witnessed a Tech game was 
presentestimated at 10,000 and were 
kept alive every minute.
Tech Rooters in Limelight.
Had the Techites scored on the 
gridiron as heavily as did their con
stituents in the stands in rooting, the 
final tally would have been reversed. 
As it was, the Plaid students far out
classed Pitt in the support offered its 
grid warriors and the concerted cheer
ing of the Skibo lads was the best 
ever heard here. In fact, the cheer
ing of the Tech crowd was one of the 
outstanding features of the afternoon 
and did much to enliven the contest.
A crowd of spectators estimated at 
about 10,000, encouraged by the ideal 
brand of weather served up for the 
occasion, turned out to witness the 
game. The cheering of the rival stu
dent bodies started a half hour beContinued on Page 7
GOOD CROWD AT Y. M. C. A. 
MEETING.
Arrangements Made for Organization.
The second general meeting of the 
Y. M. C. A. was held last Sunday in 
the Design School Theater. Mr. McConnehay, of the Hill Top Y. M. C. 
A., made an address of welcome ex
tended by the organization in the city 
and gave an interesting outline of the 
work. As provided last week, Mr. 
Ehlers, state organizer, was present 
and the organization was taken up in 
detail. A committee was appointed to 
frame a constitution and to present 
nominations at the next meeting which 
takes place next Sunday afternoon at 
three oclock.
Prospects are bright for the new 
activity. Those Who attended the 
meeting last Sunday feel that the or
ganization is bound to be a success. 
The promoters hope that a large at
tendance will imfcike next Sunday's 
meeting a regular meeting. Let 
every Tech man who wants to see a 
good thing grow, talk Y. M. C. A. 
the rest of the week and be on the 
job Sunday afternoon.
IKE FOOTBALL SMOKER
Large Enthusiastic Crowd Present.
That Carnegie Tech should be just
ly proud of her many loyal students, 
was again shown last Saturday even
ing as well as in the afternoon, by the 
spirit shown. At the smoker given 
in Carnegie Union for the benefit of 
the football training house, a large 
number of Techites came forth and 
showed that their love for Dear Old 
Tech was not dimmed even for the 
moment in the face of the afternoons 
defeat. Although every heart there 
was probably a little heavy because 
of the afternoons result yet every 
face smiled with gladness. One speak
er was heard to remark that he 
thought that the spirit and enthusi
asm of those present was not only re
markable but wonderful.
Perhaps one of the interesting and 
surprising things of the evening was 
the speech of the chairman of a com
mittee representing the Oakland 
Board of Trade. This gentleman 
praised the student body, saying that

TECH ENDS SEASON WITH 
WESTERN RESERVE.
Cleveland College Has Very Fast 
Team.
Twice before has Western Reserve 
journeyed to Pittsburgh to play Car
negie. Back in 1909 when Tech had 
the strongest eleven in her history up 
to this year, we defeated the Ohioans 
6-5, but in 1911 they secured ample 
revenge by winning, 15-0.
According to reports Western Re
serve has this year, as has Case, their 
next-door neighbors and greatest 
rivals, the best team in their history. 
But they have been going Case one 
better in each game of the season so 
far by winning by a much larger 
score than did the Scientists against 
the same teams. Especially was this 
noticeable Saturday when they ran 
up 35 points against Mt. Union, where 
Case only secured nineteen.
According to reports W'estern Re
serve has a lighter team than those 
that they used to send down, averag
ing some five pounds less than ours. 
However, they have the fastest backfield in the State of Ohio and use a 
great variety of open plays. Our ends 
will probably bear the brunt of Sat
urdays contest.
The team came through the Pitt 
game in good shape, except for McContinued on Page 5

NIGHT SCIENCE SMOKER.
Annual Event Comes Off Nov. 20th.
The annual Night Science Smoker, 
THE social function of the year so 
far as the Night Science men are con
cerned, has been arranged for No
vember 20th, to be held in the An
derson Hotel.
The standard set by the successes 
of previous years is high, but it is 
confidently anticipated by the com
mittee in charge of the arrangements 
that November 20th will see the at
tainment of the high water mark.
We have been fortunate enough to 
enlist the help of Dr. Fred Galpin, a 
speaker at the same time witty and 
intellectual. Dean Leete has kindly 
promised to be with us and those who 
heard his encouraging talk last year 
will require no further invitation.
A novel entertainment will be pro
vided and the usual gastronomic in
ducements and tonsil teasters will be 
on hand.
Seventy-five cents will get your tick
et from your class President. Do it

TE(IE SECOND IN 
(ROSS (01INTR RACE
Fast Time Made in Annual P. A. A.
Event.
The annual cross country run held 
last Saturday resulted in the Tech 
team finishing in second place by a 
comfortable margin. According to 
the way the rain precipitated on Fri
day it looked like it was going to be 
a swimming race. But during the 
night it cleared up a little and Satur
day morning the sun came out and 
dried things up somewhat. But the 
course was still wet and slippery and 
hardly a fair test on the runners. In 
every case it was found that only men 
equipped with spikes crossed the line 
among the first.
The team representing the P. A. A. 
was composed of G. A. Caughey, Joe 
Organ, W. D. Hird, H. E. Warren, 
and D. W. Wait. The first man to 
appear before the eagerly waiting 
crowd, which thronged Forbes Field 
to see the Pitt-Tech football game, 
was G. C. Caughey, of the P. A. A. 
Then came Joe Organ of the P. A. A. 
and J. C. Richards of Westminster. 
Both men ran a neck and neck race 
after entering the field but the former 
by a sprint at the very end, crossed 
the line second. In the fourth place

SELF-GOVERNMENT
CONVENTION.
Girls Have Enjoyable Time at Cleve
land.
Thursday morning Miss Mary Ride, 
president of the Self-Government As
sociation, and Miss Margaret Worth 
left Pittsburgh for Cleveland, where 
the annual convention of Self-Govern
ment Associations was held for this 
year. There were 75 delegates pres
ent, all sent from colleges east of the 
Mississippi River and as far south as 
the Gulf of Mexico. It is the custom 
to send two from each college, the 
president of the association, a Senior, 
and a Junior delegate elected by the 
student body. It is the purpose of 
these conventions to talk over univer
sal problems, get new ideas and a 
better understanding of what other 
colleges besides ones own are doing.
Our two delegates arrived in Cleve
land about noon. They were met by 
automobiles and taken immediately 
to Western Reserve. In the after
noon tea was served to the visitors in

TARTAN NEWS.
During the past few days we have 
unfortunately received a number of 
complaints in reference to the omit
ting of certain news items of various 
nature. First of all we wish to say 
that any news that may have been 
omitted was entirely dnintentional on 
our part. The chief difficulty being 
that the news items were not sent to 
us at a proper time so that they 
could be published, or were not put 
in the proper hands. During the next 
few days there will be placed in each 
of the four buildings of the different 
schools boxes for the purpose of col
lecting news items for publication. 
News which is to appear in the Tartan 
must be placed in these boxes before 
Friday evening previous to the next 
issue of the Tartan. We solicit any 
news which is of interest to the stu
dent body or which may be of some 
interest to a certain group of stu
dents. Any suggestions or ideas in 
reference to the improvement of the 
Tartan will be gladly received. And 
again we wish to state that it is our 
policy to make the Tartan a paper 
which will not only contain news of 
a more general nature but also to give 
to the student body a means of sug
gesting various subjects of import 
through our communication column.
Any news items sent through the mail 
should be addressed to the News Ed
itor of the Tartan and sent to the Car
negie Institute of Technology.
FOOTBALL AND THE HIGHER 
EDUCATION.
The following is a reprint from the 
editorial page of the New York 
World of November 1, 1915:
It is, sir, as I have said, a small 
college. And yet there are those 
who love it.Daniel Webster.
Some of the football scores of the 
present season are not without an 
ominous significance in their bearing 
on the quality of education at our 
leading universities. When the Uni
versity of Virginia beats Yale and 
plays a stubborn losing game with 
Harvard; when Colgate with a stu
dent body hardly as large as the Yale 
faculty dedicates the Bowl to another 
defeat; when Lafayette trounces the 
University of Pennsylvania, though 
having but one-tenth as many students 
from which to recruit a teamwhat 
must the conclusion be? Are the 
smaller colleges justifying Websters 
encomium in a new field of education?
Certainly something is wrong with 
the scheme of football instruction at 
the larger and richer seats of learn
ing when the small colleges with not 
enough students to make a freshman 
class at a university can thus hold 
their own against them on the grid
iron. Of what avail are vast endow
ments and costly coaches and stadi
ums yielding enormous revenues for 
athletic sports when the team of bu
colic invaders carries off the honors?
Is it the effect of luxury or em
barrassment of numbers? Do the 
Spartan attributes of football valor 
flourish best at the little colleges? In 
the matter of Greek and Latin the 
large universities m'ay continue to 
look down on their lesser rivals, but 
when Colgate and Lafayette beat 
them in athletics the competition be
comes serious and may well awaken 
concern as to its influence on the 
youth choosing his Alma Mater.

The New York State Club is plan
ning a big smoker to be held in the

7. All men coming from the State 
of New York are invited and it is 
hoped that a big crowd turns out.
PLEBES TOSSED IN BLANKET.
The second Aviation Meet of the 
year occurred after the General Lec
ture on Wednesday, November 3rd. 
All of the men tossed, were first tried 
by the Senior Committee, who found 
them guilty of breaking one or more 
of the Rules. Five more men will 
have to submit to the blanket on 
next Wednesday according to infor
mation handed out by the Commit
tee. These violations of Plebe cus
toms will have to stop, and no doubt 
more drastic measures will be used 
in the future. The regulations are 
not half as severe as at many other 
colleges, and surely the men should 
have enough respect for their college 
to live up to them.

FRATERNITY NEWS.
At a meeting of the representatives 
of the different fraternities the Inner 
Fraternity Dance was decided to be 
held on December 3. The place will 
be set at a later date. As the spirit 
between the fraternities at Tech was 
never better than at the present time, 
there is no reason why this annual 
event can't be more successful than 
ever before.
The following fraternity men were 
in Pittsburgh Saturday in order that 
they might witness the annual foot
ball game between Pitt and Tech:
Sigma Tau: Harry Balsinger, Jake 
Seigle and Frank Round; Sigma Rho: 
Art McGill, Harry Seeley, Ed Duff, 
P. K. McGill, Herman Petermann, 
John Gearhart, George Blair and Jack 
Feiff; Beta Theta: F. E. Graham, E.
H. Grotefend, T. O. Carlisle, H. W. 
Crosby; Zeta Lambda: P. E. Finger, 
S. Applegate, Bill Welch, D. S. Gard
ner and Bill Gaylor.
Bob Stryker, who was operated on 
for appendicitis a few weeks ago, at 
the Mercy Hospital, has taken a re
lapse and it is feared another opera
tion will be necessary.
Cold weather finds Fredericks and 
Spring tied for the honors in the Sig
ma Tau Tennis Tournament. It is 
hoped the weather man will have a 
heart so that the much coveted 
house championship will be decided 
soon.
E. H. Grotefend, a Beta Theta 
Alumnus, has accepted a position as 
purchasing agent for the American 
Aluminum Co. For the present he 
will have his office in the Oliver 
Building, Pittsburgh.
On Halloween evening the Zeta 
Lambda Fraternity enjoyed one of 
the most successful parties ever given 
by that fraternity. The house, which 
was decorated with streamers and 
banners of the fraternity colors, made 
a perfect setting for the thirty-five 
members and their friends. After a 
dainty lunch the party indulged in 
playing games and dancing.
Among the alumnae guests were: 
Bill Gaylott, Don Gardner, A. D. 
More, Dan McFarland, Stanley 
Connel, Bill Welch and Cook 
Cortland. Prof. Stanton and wife 
acted as chaperones.
Mr. H. B. Applegate, 14, has re
turned from New York where he has 
been taking a student course with the 
Standard Oil Co. He has accepted a 
position at Calcutta, India, with the 
above company, and will leave after 
a weeks lay-over at the Zeta Lambda 
House.
was awarded first prize. This prize 
was a victrola presented to Tech stu
dents. This victrola will be kept in 
the Union for the use of all.
During the evening a number of 
the alumni present were called on 
for small talks, as were also a number 
of the faculty present. One of the 
interesting talks, probably the most 
interesting to the students, was that 
of Coach Steffen, who told them some 
of the inside dope on last Saturdays 
game. He also remarked on a few 
of his plans for next year. Coach 
Steffen was greeted by remarkable 
enthusiasm by those present, which 
only goes to show how every loyal 
Tech student honors our sturdy little 
gridiron director.
C. F. Marshall, champion middle
weight wrestler of the Central At
lantic States, who is now Captain of 
Pittsburgh motorcycle police, and 
who played on the varsity football 
eleven in 1908, was there to show the 
boys what a strong man looked like. 
Marshall was also scheduled for a 
wrestling stunt, but his opponent 
failed to show up, evidently finding 
it necessary to be elsewhere.
he crowd was also entertained by 
the band and some Charley Chaplin 
movies. Plenty of cider, smokes and 
eats managed to entertain those pres
ent in another way. The smoker 
broke up at 11 P. M., and all wended 
their way homeward with the happy 
thoughts that some day we would 
come into our just deserts and be
come the real victors.

they were always first in all things

took was always original and they

of his speech was the Halloween

that as Oaklands Parade was men

showing the best in the parade. In 
conclusion he stated that to the foregood overcoats
Overcoats have become more than simply an over garment,

Hats off to the Pitt eleven. It is 
far from a disgrace to be defeated by 
such a team. Remember that we are 
only nine points behind W. & J. and 
have quite a margin over the Navy 
and the Indians.
It is funny how an excellent team 
with a strong offense and defense can 
be made to look like a lot of dubs by 
a still greater eleven.
Pitt excelled in every department 
except spirit and getting down under 
punts. Our team and bleachers 
fought gamely to the last as was to 
be expected.
That last cheer for Pitt after the 
game was lost, to their rooters who 
departed early. Our bunch stuck and 
cheered till ten minutes after the 
game and last of all gave one for our 
opponents.
Our interference was usually swal
lowed up before it got past tackle, 
leaving the runner all alone, with 
little hope of gaining. On the de
fense, the ends found it impossible 
to either get the runner or his inter
ference as they were boxed at the 
start of the play.
The Tech eleven is unanimous that 
Pitt played the cleanest game of any 
contest this season. This was true 
also last year and reflects great credit 
to our opponents. Not an unsports
manlike play was seen from the grand
stand and the only penalties were for 
offside.
Our line charged their hardest, but 
superior weight and skill were too 
great a handicap. The secondary de

NOTED LECTURER AT 
M. M. C. S.
Instead of the regular assembly, 
Mr. Ashbee spoke to the girls on 
Tuesday morning at 11:30. His sub
ject was Civic Ideals, which was 
developed through the three chan
nels, the home, the street, and the 
city. Beginning, as Mr. Ashbee said, 
from the inside, out, one is able to 
see much more clearly the inter-dependence of one on the other, and 
how one is made beautiful as the re
sult of the other being improved. In 
the home, the speaker urged us to 
discard the superfluous and machine 
made, but to cherish carefully the 
needed and hand-made articles. He 
showed us the need of individuality in 
our home furnishings which Mr. Ash
bee considered, included its character, 
a certain style, and above all quality 
rather than quantity.
When the homes are beautiful it 
is but a single step till the streets are 
likewise, which in turn affects the 
whole city so that it may be termed 
ideal in its conception.
By means of lantern slides Mr. Ash
bee showed in a very emphatic way 
what he considered bad and what he 
considered good in these three fields. 
He also explained the Garden City 
Movement in Europe which aimed to 
make a city beautiful by breaking up 
its largeness, and by allowing it to 
expand intelligently. The speaker 
showed convincing figures of death 
rates in the various cities which fully 
showed the superiority of the cities 
which had been treated by this move
ment.
Mr. Ashbee concluded by saying 
that he thought it was the duty of 
woman to bring the esthetic beauty 
now lost back into the home, the 
street and the city.
At the conclusion of the lecture 
Miss Breed entertained Mr. Ashbee, 
Mr. and Mrs. Brossange, the Direc
tor and Mrs. Vermocken at luncheon, 
which was prepared and served by the 
Sophomore class in Cooking under 
the direction of Miss Collingwood.
NIGHT GIRLS PART..
Last Tuesday evening, in Recrea
tion Hall, the Night Girls had a party, 
which was the first of a series of 
monthly entertainments to be given 
throughout the school year. Each 
month the program is to be in charge 
of a different department in the 
school, the Secretarial having planned 
the first. Mr. Goldberger, who is a 
field worker in the Bureau of Voca
tional Guidance in the Public Schools, 
spoke to the girls concerning his work 
which was most interesting as well 
as very helpful. Dr. Bingham, head 
of the Department for Training 
Teachers, also made a few impromptu 
remarks.
At the close of the speaking, the 
girls spent a delightful social hour
when refreshments were served. 
Dancing was also indulged in. This 
part of the program was in charge of 
Miss Stoner, chairman of the com
mittee on Night School Activities.
DRAMATIC CLUB.
At a meeting of the Dramatic Club 
held last week it was decided to give 
the play, The Burglar that Failed 
next Tuesday afternoon at 4:00 in 
the gymnasium. All the girls in the 
school are invited whether they are 
members of the Dramatic Club or 
not. THERE WILL BE NO AD
MISSION. The purpose of the play 
is to bring the Dramatic Club before 
the girls in such a manner that they 
will be interested enough to join and 
come to its meetings. The yearly 
dues are 50 cents and may be paid to 
either the President, Miss Francis 
Willis, or the Treasurer, Miss Ruth 
Pontius.
After the play refreshments will be 
served. It is hoped that all the girls 
will take this opportunity to find out 
just what the Dramatic Club is and 
what it does.
LECTURE IN COMMUNIT. 
WORK.
The lecturer this week in Com
munity Work was Mr. Lundquist, who 
is an instructor in the Pittsburgh 
High Schools. The subject was the 
Organization of Social Centers and 
Mr. Lundquist gave much valuable 
advice in regard to such an under
taking, based principally upon his ex
periences in the social center at Sterrett School, of which he is the head. 
The speaker emphasized especially 
the great need of diplomacy, an in
exhaustible supply of patience and a 
firm belief in the ultimate success of 
the undertaking. There is no doubt 
but that if one were able to follow 
exactly the suggestions made the re
sults would of a necessity be of a 
greatly gratifying nature.
DORM. DANCE.
The girls of the Morewood Avenue 
dormitory held an informal house 
dance last Friday evening, November 
12th. About twenty couples attended. 
Miss Collingwood and Miss Murdoch 
chaperoned. The dancing lasted from 
8:30 until 12 oclock, and everybody 
seemed to thoroughly enjoy them
selves.
DORM. TEA.
The Morewood Avenue dormitory 
had open house lajt Sunday after
noon, November 14th, when Miss 
Collingwood held her regular second 
Sunday of the month tea. The Misses 
Brady, Kirk, Snively, Thompson and 
Wilson assisted.SELF-GOVERNMENT
Continued from Page 1 
Guilford Hall, which afforded an ex
cellent chance to get acquainted as 
this was the first meeting of all the 
delegates. In the evening, there was 
a large reception, at which the presi
dent of the college, the dean, and offi
cers of the Self-Government Associa
tion of Western Reserve stood in the 
receiving line. By this time all the 
girls were fairly well acquainted and 
succeeded in enjoying themselves 
fully.
On Friday morning was held the 
first closed meeting at which college 
problems concerning particularly the 
girls present were discussed. The 
honor system, faculty advisors, theft, 
dormitory rules, were some of the 
subjects considered. By thus com
paring ideas and plans much was 
learned by all which could aid them 
in solving their own individual prob
lems. Friday afternoon, there was a 
big open meeting held in the college 
chapel to which everyone was invited. 
At this meeting, the president of each 
association gave a short talk on the 
policy of the executive board, thus 
giving each girl a chance to explain 
her idea and see how it compared 
with the plans of others.
Friday evening the Dramatic Club 
of Western Reserve presented two 
plays for the entertainment of the 
visitors. These were The Neigh
bors and A Twelve-Pound Look. 
They were presented in a very excel
lent and finished manner and reflect 
great credit on the school.
On Saturday morning the second 
closed meeting was held at which 
other college problems were present
ed and discussed. In the afternoon 
the delegates were taken on a sight
seeing trip through Cleveland, giving 
the girls an excellent idea of the resi
dential and business sections of the 
city.
The convention closed with a banbuet Saturday evening, at which the 
Junior delegates were asked to give 
informal talks. Most of the girls then 
left either Saturday night or Sunday 
morning after declaring with positive 
joy that they had had a most wonder
ful and happy time, due principally 
to the excellent treatment they re
ceived at the hands of their hostesses.
It was decided to have the conven
tion next year at Mt. Holyoke, Mass.TECH SECOND IN RACE

Eight and ninth came Warren and 
Wait of the P. A. A. with A. J. Walk
er of Carnegie Tech running tenth.
The race was made in the extremely 
fast time of 30 minutes 9 seconds, 
considering the wetness of the track. 
The course started at Forbes Field, 
wound through Schenley Park for 
over six miles, and ended in Forbes 
Field again.
The winner of the team cup was de
cided by adding the number at the 
finish, of each runner. The final 
scores were as follows: P. A. A., 31;
Carnegie Tech, 48; Pitt, 64; West
minster fourth place.
Gold, silver, and bronze plaques 
were awarded the first three men, the 
next five men receiving bronze med
als. The team trophy was a silver 
mounted plaque.
In spite of the fact that Tech came 
in second the Carnegie men deserve 
a great deal of credit. The P. A. A. 
team is composed of older college 
men, almost all of them stars.

Qpye 1l1I5
Coach Steffens ability as an orator 
was demonstrated at our Assembly 
last Wednesday when he expressed 
in terse terms just what he and his 
team were doing in the line of foot
ball. The applause the coach received 
before and after his address indicated 
the faith the students have in his 
method of handling the pigskin chas
ers. His attitude on the Pitt game 
fired Industries with hope and enthus
iasm and although last Saturdays re
sults were not on the victory end for 
dear old Tech, nevertheless the show
ing our men made illustrated very 
clearly the result of his hard and 
energetic work to bring our team to 
the high standard it has attained this 
year. Pitts victory was not a defeat 
morally as may be outlined in other 
columns of this paper but we did 
gain a still greater victory from the 
standpoint of student enthusiasm and 
ability to cheer along our team. The 
local papers even went so far as to 
state that the Pitt student body went 
to the game for no other reason than 
to see their team go through its ma
chine-like routine. Their cheering 
was poor and we have the consola
tion that we outdid them heartily and 
that a great bulk of the noise came 
from our own Industries aggregation.
At the last Assembly President 
Peters outlined to the newer students 
the advantages to be gained by at
tending the plays given at the Design 
School for which there is no admis
sion charged. If the Plebes and also 
some of the older men would get ac
quainted with this branch of our 
larger schools they would find the 
Dramatic Art plays both instructive 
and interesting.
Some of the Industries boys 
brought a young bull to the football 
game last Saturday with a little doll 
perched on its back and Pitt ribbons 
flying from both extremities. We are 
still wondering whether that bovine 
influenced the score. Numerous snap
shots were taken of the handsome 
beast.
There seems to be a dearth of In
dustries men in athletics this year. 
Most of the star men of last years 
track and cross-country teams are not 
with us, recalling Hemmann, who did 
the hundred in ten flat at the InterSchool contest last April which S. A.
I. won /handsomely; Dunseith, the 
quarter-miler, and several others who 
helped bring the Hamerschlag trophy 
to our school. This is an appeal to 
all the students in our school who 
have any athletic ability at all, to 
start right in and get the training nec
essary to put them in the pink of 
condition for the many contests which 
are soon to be.
Dockstader and Moore, both Indus
tries men finished nicely in the fivemile race chich ended on Forbes Field 
last Saturday.
Recalling the Tech-Case game in 
Cleveland, the S. A. I. boys who re
mained over to view the doings have 
gotten together and formed a club 
with the handle The Twenty. We
know neither their object of organ
izing or their ideals but from what 
rumor reports they are planning some 
jolly times along the same lines as 
were followed in the Sixth City. Good 
luck.
With Galley, Rodgers and Kaiser 
on a committee to arrange for Tech 
stationery, we may soon see that 
necessity on sale.
Next Friday evening in Carnegie 
Union the Upper and Middle classes 
will give a dance in honor of the In
dustries Freshmen.
The Middle class held a meeting 
last Thursday. Secretary and Treas
urer C. K. Koontz being burdened 
with too many other duties found it 
necessary to resign. F. J. OBrien 
was elected Secretary and B. C. 
Speicher was elected Treasurer of the 
class.
NEW DRAWING ROOM.
The new drawing room on the top 
floor of the new addition to the In
dustries School will be used by class
es for the first time this week. This 
room is large, well ventilated and well 
lighted, the large skylights in the roof 
making the lighting most ideal for 
drawing. The other rooms will be 
occupied as soon as the necessary 
equipment arrives.
TECH ENDS SEASON
Continued from Page 1 
Featers, who is still very lame. Kesner and Altdoerffer both wrenched 
their game legs but are in better shape 
than a week ago. Unless unlooked 
for accidents occur, we will certainly 
place our full strength in the field.
Saturdays game will certainly be 
the best of the season. Our oppon
ents will be the strongest team on our 
schedule except for Pitt. A fast, hard 
game is assured and a large crowd 
will be present, there being no other 
important games in the city.

Apmosphee of Dixie PedomiI1pes.
The Southern Club of C. I. T. held 
their first annual dinner and house 
warming at the club house on October 
30, 1915.
All members and lady friends at
tended the Allegheny-Tech football 
game, after which a Southern dinner 
was served to 54. Dancing was en
joyed in the evening.
All the fraternities and faculty 
were represented and were enter
tained with real Southern hospitality, 
enjoying an excellent time.
Decorations were Southern moss, 
corn, cotton and peanuts.
The club intends to make this Jn 
annual affair.
Harvards total enrollment so far 
this year shows an increase of 206 
over that of last year. Most of this 
increase is in the Law School and the 
sophomore class of the college.

Artists, to earn your way to the Prom. 
REPETITION OF THE
MEDIEVAL BALL.
The Medieval Ball of last week far 
over-reached our most eager expecta
tions and in point of artistic detail, 
surpassed all similar functions of for
mer years. The costumes represent
ing varied dates and casts were a 
surprise in that their beauty masked 
a medieval tempor that was a revela
tion. All incidents of the evenings 
revel pointed directly to a medieval 
charm that will seldom be equalled. 
Who can enjoy the art of such an 
event more than the artist himself? 
The only immortal songs are those 
sung because the singers could not 
help it. Art is the beautiful way of 
doing thingsit is the expression of 
mans joy in his work. Here Art held 
sovereign sway, everyone lived in an 
age long ago forgotten; but now ad
mirably resurrected, and the evenings 
pleasure was fertile with the true art
ists touch.
This Medieval Ball will be repeated 
upon Tuesday, November the 23rd, at 
which time guests will be present and 
any registered student of the four 
schools may attend.
After this date special balconies 
will be erected for the guests and 
every effort will be exerted to make 
it a pleasant occasion.
The students may secure advice and 
cuts for their costumes in the lobby 
of the Design School upon Wednes
day and Thursday afternoon of this 
week at 4:30 oclock. A committee 
will be at hand at that time to ad
vise those who wish to secure new 
ideas for their costumes and will 
direct them to the library of the De
sign School where an adequate sup
ply of colored costume cuts may be 
seen. The Tartan will also run 
three typical medieval costume cuts 
which may be taken as unique and 
authoritative. The officers in charge 
of the ball have made very emphatic 
the note that all costumes must ad
here in every regard to the Charlemange or medieval period. This point 
must be heeded precisely in every 
respect as no one will be admitted 
whose costume does not conform to 
those of the medieval periods.
Admittance will be by pass or pay
ment of an assessment of seventyfive (75) cents at the door. Those 
now holding passes may use them on 
the 23rd. Others can secure such 
upon application and fee payment to 
the committee in the Design lobby 
Wednesday and Thursday of this 
week.
Those who desire a pass souvenir 
with name engraved thereon, may se
cure such thrrough the costume com
mittee at an extra assessment of 
twenty-five (25) cents.
Lockers and dressing rooms will be 
provided for all.
The system of five baseball games 
proved too much for Harvard, Yale, 
tnd Princeton last year and the au
thorities in charge of the athletics 
in those three colleges have decided 
to return to the best two out of three

PLEBE FOOTBALL.
A great deal of enthusiasm is being 
shown by many of the Plebes in the 
organizing of a football team. Prac
tice was held on Saturday in order to 
get a line on the men good enough for 
the team. There is plenty of material 
to pick from and there should be little 
difficulty in putting out a good team. 
The important game scheduled is 
with the Seniors on Carnegie Day. 
The Plebes are confident that they 
can win and the Seniors will have to 
work in order to uphold their dignity.
PLEBES TO GIVE SMOKER.
At a recent meeting of the Plebe 
class Friday, December 11th, was 
chosen as the date of their first social 
affair. It is to be a smoker for the 
Upper classmen.
VARSITY MEETS FIRST DEFEAT
Continued from Page 1 
fore game time and those who came 
early were well repaid.
Red Heifer Figures.
With thousands of happy and en
thusiastic spectators, it was but nat
ural that more than casual notice 
should be taken of one who was not 
only a disinterested party but wish
ed with all his heart to be many 
miles away. In fact, so anxious was 
this spectator to get out of hearing 
of the wildly cheering mob, that it 
was necessary to tie him to a post. 
This spectator was a gentleman of 
colora red heifer. He had been 
brought to Forbes Field by Tech stu
dents and was draped with a cloth on 
which the letters P-I-T-T had been 
painted. On his back was tied a large 
male doll and around his neck was an 
assortment of vari-colored ribbons. 
He figured in no way in the after
noons entertainment, although it is 
suspected that the Skibo lads had 
planned to lead him about the field 
in a parade between halves, which, at 
the last moment, was called off.
The game started at 2:37, seven 
minutes after the usual starting per
iod. he Pitt team was on the field 
early but the kickoff was delayed by 
a tardiness on the part of Tech. Tech 
put up a wonderful battle during the 
first 17 minutes of play, the ball be
ing kept in Pitts territory every sec
ond of this time.
Our Opponents.
Previous to the game reports had 
been circulated that our line was out
weighed by several pounds, giving 
the Tech supporters more confidence, 
but when the Pitt men romped onto 
the field even a blihd man could have
Half the style of a tailored suit is lost, unless the suit is kept perfectly clean and nicely pressed. We have cleaned and pressed so many ladies tailorsd suits that we have become experts at it. and return your garments so nicely finished as to elicit praise from even the most critical. Send your suit to us frequently. J. E. T. Shuman, 3911 Forbes St. Adv.
seen that 20 pounds more weight 
would have been a closer guess. This 
line was not only heavy but also 
very fast and played a most import
ant part in Coach Warners wonder
ful interference system which has un
doubtedly put the Pitt team in its 
present position as the most likely 
championship team of the country. 
On end runs the man with the ball 
was preceded by six men on every 
occasion and each man interfered 
well and effectively. Williamson and 
Hastings revealed speedy and heady 
running, while McClaren bulleted 
through the line repeatedly for gains. 
Heavy Field To Our Disadvantage.
Against such a heavy line Techs 
only chance for gains was on end runs 
by our clever and speedy backfield. 
The field, however, was so heavy that 
Kesner, Finlay, and Marshal lost their 
footing repeatedly in attempting to 
elude their opponents and Aultdoerffer was unable to get a good start. 
Kutz and Hellstrom were in evidence 
for some sterling tackling and allaround defensive work. Lauer and 
Gibson are likewise to be given credit 
for the times they eluded the Pitt for
wards and nailed their man. Kelly 
and Fletcher were fighting every min
ute and showed that they could hold 
their heavier opponents as soon as 
they had one foot on dry land. Wil
liams, on left tackle, played a hard 
and consistent game against great 
odds. Much praise is due our rep
resentatives for the clean, hard, and 
spirited resistance against their op
ponents, never for a moment giving 
up or losing the idea that we were 
going to score at least.
Hastings Makes First Score.
One minute after the center of the 
field was crossed by Pitt, however, 
the first touchdown was made. With 
the ball on Pitts 47-yard mark, a 
double pass, McNulty to Williamson, 
carried the ball to Techs 43-yard 
line. McLaren then plunged through 
right guard to Techs 40-yard mark 
and followed with another play 
through the same hole, placing the 
ball on Techs 33-yard line. Here 
Hastings skirted Techs left end, and 
by outsprinting several Plaid players 
and receiving excellent interference, 
he ran the remaining distance to the 
goal line. Williamson kicked out to 
McLaren on the 8-yard line and from 
where Hastings kicked an easy goal. 
Pitt 7, Tech 0.
Pitt seemed over anxious in this 
period and did not play as smoothly 
as in earlier games. It is probably 
that an injury to Bob Peck, the Gold 
and Blue teams best bid for allAmerican center had something to do 
with this. Peck was hurt on the first 
kickoff when he was spilled by Fletch
er after Kutz had kicked out of bounds 
on Pitts 20-yard mark. Bob showed 
his gameness, however, and after a 
short delay, returned to his position.
Hastings Scores Again.
With the ball in middlefield at the 
start of the second period, Hastings 
rounded Techs right end for a twoyard gain. The spectators then re
ceived a thrill when Williamson, on a 
kick formation, ran 17 yards around 
Techs right end and placed the ball

VARSITY MEETS FIRST DEFEAT
Continued from Page 7 
on the Plaid teams 31-yard line. 
Hastings |added ;two yards at left 
tackle and McLaren carried it to the 
25-yard line. McLaren crashed 
through the line for five yards and 
first down. On the next play, Capt. 
Lauer stopped McLarens plunge in 
the line but McNulty carried the pig
skin to the 11-yard mark, going 
around left end. McLaren smashed 
through Techs left guard for a fouryard gain and Hastings then carried 
the ball over and kicked goal. Score 
Pitt 14, Tech 0.
Up to this period of the game, Alt
doerffer, Techs crack fullback, was 
starring by sensational tackles and 
general all-around work both on the 
offense and defense. This change oc
curred after Pitts second touchdown. 
Meadows was also sent in for Wil
liamson and Shapira for Peck. No 
additional scores were made in the 
second period, but it was near the 
end of this session that McLarens 
fumble robbed Warners gridders of 
another touchdown.
McLaren Gets Touchdown.
The same players who were in the 
lineup at the end of the second period 
were sent in at the start of the third. 
Near the start of the second half, Pitt 
was forced to punt, Hastings kicking 
to Kesner on Techs 25-yard line, from 
which mark he carried it back 10 
yards. Kesner failed at Pitts left 
end when tackled by Hastings. On 
the next play Finlay fumbled and 
Hockensmith fell on the ball on 
Techs 28-yard mark. Hastings made 
three yards at Techs left end, Lauer 
tackling. McLaren carried the oval 
to the Plaids 18-yard line. Hastings 
fumbled, but Shapira recovered for a 
one-yard loss. On two tries McLaren 
carried the ball to within 13 yards of 
the coveted goal line. Hastings made 
three and McNulty six yards through 
the line, and Meadows took the leath
er to Techs three-yard line. Hastings 
breezed around Techs left end and 
placed the ball within a few inches of 
the goal, and McLaren carried it over. 
Hastings kicked goal. ScorePitt 21, 
Tech 0.
After this touchdown Stahlman was 
sent in for McNulty at right half. 
Once more Pitt forced the ball over 
its opponents goal line in this period, 
but not until near its close. With the 
ball on Techs 29-yard line, Hastings 
dropped back to the 35-yard mark and 
essayed to kick a goal from place
ment, but failed. The ball was brought 
back and Tech was penalized five 
yards for being offside. Stahlman 
carried the oval to the 20-yard line 
by skirting right end. Hastings tried 
the opposite end and made three more 
yards. On the next play McLaren 
again fumbled, but recovered on 
Techs 15-yard., mark, from where 
Hastings again rounded Techs left 
end for the fourth and last touchdown 
of the game. He also kicked goal, 
making the score, Pitt 28, Tech 0.
Many Substitutions Made.
Substitutions galore were made at 
the start of the fourth period. Wil
liamson went back in the game for 
Meadows, Seidel took up Hockensmiths burden, Sies relieved Hilty,
Bond replaced Sutherland, DeHart 
was put back in the game in Stahlmans position, Gougler subbed for 
Hastings, Stahl displaced Soppitt, 
Herrington proxied for Herron, while 
Bond took up Sutherlands labors 
where Pitts big left guard left off.
Tech made but one substitution at 
this time, Brunwasser relieving the 
overworked Altdoerffer at fullback. 
No scores were made in the last per
iod, the Techites seeming to take a 
new lease on life. This change seemed 
to have been brought about by the 
injection of Brunwasser into the 
game.
Brunwasser Works Hard.
Tech really played its best game in 
this period and held Pitt for downs 
on the Gold and Blues 31-yard line. 
Marshal made 6 yards at left tackle, 
Brunwasser carried the ball to the
18-yard mark, and on the next try 
he placed it two yards closer the goal 
line. After failing to gain on his third 
try, Kutz dropped back to Techs 25- 
yard line and tried for a goal from 
placement. The ball traveled low, 
however, and Kutz failed to register. 
The longest single gain of the game 
was made by Kesner in this period, 
when he made 23 yards around Pitts 
right end.
The spectators who expected to 
witness a game replete with forward 
passes, were disappointed, although 
they saw Pitt put over an aerial pass 
that equaled anything of its kind seen 
at Forbes Field this season. This 
took place in the second quarter when 
Williamson tossed to Herron for a 
gain of 27 yards.
Pitt played a sterling game and out
played her opponents in every depart
ment and richly deserved a victory. 
Few penalties were inflicted on either 
team, all being called for offside play. 
The Skibo lads found they were out
classed shortly after the opening of 
the game but played their hardest 
every minute they were on the field.

THE GET PITT TAGS.
Nearly everyone has been wearing 
one of the new Get Pitt tags. By 
now theyre a bit out o season but 
the men in charge desire a few lines 
of explanation in that regard.
The idea was instigated by C. C. 
Wood, of the Design School, who was 
assisted in their sale by two men 
from each school. One thousand tags 
and strings were ordered at an ex
pense of $5.30. If all are sold a profit 
of $44.70 will be made, which is to be 
turned over to Coach Steffens for a 
theatre party for our team.
