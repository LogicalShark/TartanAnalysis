FOOTBALL
Our team again covered itself with glory by de
feating the strong aggregation from Waynesburg 
by a score of 18 to 0. WTaynesburg held West Vir
ginia to a 15 to 0 score last Saturday and on ac
count of this Tech was not expecting to run up such 
a score as it did. Flick made a run of 70 yards 
early in the first half which resulted in a touch
down by Hatcher a few minutes later. Hatcher made 
a perfect forward pass to Dolan a few minutes later 
who made a pretty run of 50 yards before he was 
downed. The ball was in Techs possession most of 
the first half but Waynesburg seemed to steady after 
the first touchdown and the half ended with the ball 
on Waynesburgs 35-yard line.
In the second half Waynesburg weakened consider
ably and Robinson was shoved over 10 minutes after 
play started. Capt. Hittner broke into the game here, 
taking Hatchers place, and kicked goal.
Our captains entrance into the game seemed to 
instill new life into our fellows and they tore up 
Waynesburg in great style. Hittner got the ball on 
a kick-off and ran 65 yards. He would have gotten 
away for a touch down if he had not been hindered by
his own interference. Soon after this he went over 
for the third touchdown and kicked goal.
Time was called when the bail was in steady 
progress toward Waynesburgs goal and only the 
whistle saved them from another score. Hatcher put 
up a swell game at right half and ran back punts 
with good judgment. Flick played his usual good 
game and got away for several long runs. The work 
of Robinson at fullback was especially noticeable, 
both on the offense and defense. His line bucking 
was fast and hard and he seemed to gain ground 
at will. Lloyd, Kime and Marshal did great work on 
the line. Manderville the new quarterback, ran the 
team well and made a good impression. Dolin and 
Morris prevented any long runs by the Waynesburg 
men by their speed in getting up the field and their 
hard tackling. Morris is new to an end position 
but is a sure tackier and can run with the ball.
Coldren has almost rcovered from his sickness and 
injuries and will be out for practice again this wek. 
He has evidently fixed things up with his parents 
and will be allowed to play again.

I PLEBE CLASS j
The Plebe class held a meeting on October 1 1909, 
and elected the following officers:
President, C. M Crawford; vice president, S. J. 
Taylor; secretary, T. J. Higgins; treasurer, B. E. Duff, 
Jr.; club representative, J. F. McWilliams; athletic 
representative, H. A. Woellmer; Tartan representa
tive, G. S. Blair; manager Plebe football team, L. B. 
Traver; auditors, R. S. Kline, L. Middleman, J. H. 
Clements.
The Plebes have a bright prospect ahead for this 
years football team. Manager Traver has not com
pleted his schedule as yet, but on Saturday, October 
16, the New Brighton H. S. will be here to play either 
before or after the game with Western Reserve. 
On Saturday, the 23rd, the Plebes will go to Car
negie to play Carnegie H. S.
Bell, in chemistry, It is necessary to electrocute 
water to prepare hydrogen.
APPLIED DESIGN I*
Mr. Heinrich Schapper has been appointed in
structor in the School of Applied Design for the 
coming year. He will conduct the classes in Physics 
and Electricity, and take temporary charge of the 
class in French until other arrangements can be 
made.
Mr. Schapper is a native of Germany. He gradu
ated in Electrical Engineering from the School of 
Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany, in 1903. Coming 
directly to this country he entered the Massachu
setts Institute of Technology, graduating from the 
department of Physics in that institution in 1904. 
He was then appointed Professor of Physics at the 
University of Arkansas, where he organized and 
conducted his department for four years. He re
signed this position in 1908 to return to Europe, 
where he spent fifteen months studying at the Uni
versities of Geneva, Paris, Cambridge, and Heidel
berg. He received the degree of Ph.D. for' special re
search work in the University of Geneva. He has 
published some works on special subjects of Phy
sical Research and Mathematics, some of which are 
used as text books by leading American Universi
ties. Mr. Schapper has entered upon his work with 
much interest and success, and will greatly 
strengthen the faculty of the school.
If a force capable of freezing any subtance should 
come in contact with a force too dry to be frozen the 
result would be calculus and analytics. The above is 
the definition as given by Mr. Burgey in class. We 
think he hits the nail on the head.
The other day Jerome Spaudeau, a Plebe architect, 
was married in Warren, Ohio. The Architects extend 
to him their best wishes.

THE TARTAN5
THE SLIDE RULEWITH EXERCISES FOR 
BEGINNERS.
(This is the first of a series of articles on the Slide 
Rule which the Tartan will publish within the nexr 
few weeks.
These lessons are designed to furnish anyone 
who carefully reads them and works out the examples 
included, with a practical working knowledge of the 
operation of the Slide Rule sufficient for all ordinary 
uses.)
INTRODUCTORY.The slide rule is an instrument 
for calculating. Multiplication and division are per
formed mechanically by adding or subtracting lengths 
on the scale. The instrument has become an indis
pensable aid to the engineei owing to the speed and 
ease with which calculations may be made.
The object of this paper is not to explain the theory 
of the slide rule, but to give a series of exercises to 
those who wish to learn its use
The usual form of slide rule is shown in Figure 1, 
the actual length being about ten inches.
There are four scales; the lower pair, marked C 
and D, are alike and represent the logarithms of all 
numbers from one to ten. The distances possess the 
properties of logarithms. For example, the distance 
from 1 to 4 is twice that from 1 to 2, because log 4= 
2xlog 2.
The upper scales, A and B, are like the lower ones, 
only half as long and repeated, making two scales 
exactly alike. Their combined length is equal to the 
lower scales. When arranged thus, the numbers oi> 
the upper scale are the squares of the numbers on
of numbers on the scale. To aid in this, the location 
of the integers 1, 2, 3, etc., is marked on all the scales. 
In addition, the tenths between 1 and 2 are marked 
on the lower scales. Many other numbers are shown 
by intermediate graduations, not marked. In general, 
however, any number taken at random will lie be
tween certain graduations, the exact point being 
estimated by the eye.
Exercise I.
Place the vertical line of the runner at the follow
ing numbers on scale D:
(a) 1.1 (g) 2.9137
(b) 1.75 (h) 3750.'
(c) 1.915 (i) 415.
(d) 1.244 (j) 490.
(e) 240. (k) 57900.
(f) 282. (m) 600.
Notes on Exercises I. (a) See Fig. 2 for location
of this number and the following ones, (b) The num
ber 7 here is part of 17 and not the integer 7 which 
is found farther to the right, (g) Locate this by esti
mating between 290 and 292; only three significant 
figures can be used in this part of the scale, (h) The 
number is located without regard to the decimal 
point, so 3.75 and 3750 are found at the same place.
Fig. 2 Part of scale D, showing the numbers of 
Exercise I.
Exercise II.
Read the numbers shown by the letters a, b* c, 
etc., in the following figure, scale A.
Answers to Exercise II.: (a) 12; (b) 1413; (c) 
173; (d) 215; (e) 246; (f) 2875; (g) 31416; (h) 399; 
(i) 52; (j) 616.

the lower scale. Each pair of scales is complete in 
itself and may be used independently.
The runner is a light metal frame with a trans
parent face, which slides freely on the stock. A 
line ruled across its face serves to read across from 
upper to lower scales, also to keep the place in a 
series of operations, so that only the final result need 
be read off.
READING THE GRADUATIONS.The first step 
for the beginner is to practice finding the location
Notes on Exercise II. (a) No attention is given to 
the decimal point in any of these numbers, (b) The 
last figure is uncertain and the number may lie be
tween 1410 and 1415. (g) The number n is givensa special line, owing to its frequent use. The num
ber .7854 is also marked in this way on the upper 
scales. NoteThe italic =3.1416.
MULTIPLICATION.Either the lower or upper 
scale can be used. The first are a little more ac
curate and the second a little more convenient. Num---------------------------------------------------

6THE TARTAN
bers are used without any reference to the decimal 
point, which is determined by inspection in the final 
result.
The operation of multiplying is as follows: Place 
either end of the slide at one factor and find the 
product opposite the other factor on the slide.
The work can be done on either set of scales; to 
illustrate this the product of 125 by 17 is shown on 
the A and B scales (Fig. 4) and then on the C and 
D sc ales (Fig. 5).
125 first factor
The operations can also be shown by a diagram 
like that of figure 6, which should be carefully 
studied, as it is a compact and servicable method of 
describing the various steps. The sequence of opera
tions is as follows:

In multiplying it is best to move the runner to the 
second factor, as it aids the eye in reading across to 
the product.

91 xll.5 =1046
7.56x30.3 = 229 8 x.7854= 6.28
Notes on Exercise III. (a) The exact product is 
66.144 while the slide rule gives 661; making the 
error less than one-tenth of one per cent, (b) Here 
the drawback of the lower scale is shown; if the 
left hand end of the slide is placed at 42.5 the other 
factor extends beyond the graduation on the stock. 
The right hand end of the slide must be used. It is 
often difficult to tell, without trying, which end is 
wanted, (c) The upper scales are less accurate, ow
ing to their shorter length. Compare with the result 
of (a), (d). The result is found on the scale without 
any trouble in this case: (e) It is convenient to put
the middle of the slide at 91, instead of the left 
hand end.
Multiplication of Several Factors.The procedure 
is an extension of the single multiplication illustrated 
in figures 4 and 5. After multiplying two factors, the 
runner is fixed at the product which is treated as a 
new factor and multiplied by the third number, and 
so on.
As an example, take the numbers 23x1.4x7.2. Place 
one end of th slide at 23; move runner to 14 on 
slide; again put one end of slide at the runner; 
finally move the number to 72 on the slide and read 
the answer 232 on the stock.
(a) Set one end of slide to 23 on scale A.
(b) Move runner to 14 on slide.
(c) Leaving runner undisturbed, move end 
slide to it.
(d) Move runner to 72 on slide and read product 
232, on A.

13. x 1.3 x .67 x 27.8xx9= 8880.
Notes on Exercise IV.(a) The decimal point of 
the result is determined by inspection not by the 
slide rule. The exact result is? 3.78; it was intended 
to give results by the slide rule in the exercise, not 
by calculation, hence errors of one-third of one per 
cent, or less may be expected, (b) Either right end, 
left end, or center of slide can be set to the factor. 
In examples like this the center is most convenient, 
(c) Any integral power of a number can be found in 
this way.
The foregoing exercises should be worked out by 
the student repeatedly until they can be done with 
precision. With this preparation the complete use 
of the slide run can readily be acquired.

FOGS.
In a well mixed Metropolitan Fog there is some
thing substantial and satisfyingyou can feel what 
you breathe, and see it, too. It is like breathing 
water, as we may fancy the fishes do. And then the 
taste of it, when dashed with a fine season of seacoal smoke, is far from insipid.
It is also meat and drink at the same time; some
thing between egg-flip and omelette soufflie, but 
much more digestible than either. Not that I would 
recommend it medicallyespecially to persons that 
have greasy stomachs and delicate nervesbut for 
persons of a good robust habit of body, and not 
dainty withal (which such, by the by, never are), 
there is nothing better in its way. And it wraps you 
all round like a cloak, tooa patent water-proof one, 
which no rain ever penetrated. No.; I maintain that 
a real Fog is a thing not to be sneezed atif you 
can help it.
Somebody ought to show the Plebes a mail-box. 
The long, black box reserved for The Tartan has 
been used quite frequently as a recepticle for letters.
The use of good English is becoming somewhat 
rare among students. Expressions of slang are used 
by every one, and this tendency grows more com
mon every day. We are glad to say, however, that 
particular stress is laid upon the use of good English 
in all departments of the Margaret Morrison Car
negie School. And it is hoped that by the diligent 
efforts of the students, the use of slang will be put 
completely aside. ,
On Tuesday of last week the Plebe Class gathered 
on the field for the purpose of playing games.
The day was fine, and the girls, in the best of 
spirits, enjoyed the hour spent there.
This is the first time the Plebe Class has been to
gether on the field, and although the day may prove 
too wintry for further playing this fall, the season 
for outside games on the field will be looked forward
to eagerly by the entire class.

KEEP IT UP.
The Waynesburg game several things very evi
dent; all creditable, too. It showed that it is pos
sible for Tech to get a crowd out to see a game, and 
that it is possible to have a crowd catch the proper 
spirit of the occasion and act accordingly. The 
cheering was very much better than last week, but 
the work of the rooters would improve with several 
good practices each week. We have been making a 
careful study of the remarks made on the subject 
of cheering and enthusiasm in general, by different 
college papers throughout the country, and have yet 
to find a single instance of a bunch of rooters get
ting together without any practice and doing any
thing but pulling off a few miscellaneous yells. Sys
tematic rooting requires systematic preparation, and 
the results of good cheering are certainly worth the 
little amount of work required. Right here would 
be a good place to say that we realize the difficulty 
of finding a time to suit everybodys schedule or
 everybodys instructor, so why not make it after 
all classes are out and the team is working on the 
field? The matter of attendance at such a practice 
is not a matter of convenience, it is a duty. It suits 
the men from out of town living here in the vicinity, 
and the others should surely be able to explain to 
those at home what is going on, and how it all is. 
As a clinching argument bring them to see the game
next Saturday, and if some of the enthusiasm is not 
contagious bring them back again. The cheer leader 
cant do it all.
The services of the band are certainly appreciated, 
and the fact that they are able to get the men 
together is a big factor in their favor. During the 
last game it was noticed that Tech men were scat
tered through the entire grand stand and were not 
all in the cheering section. Any man on the grounds 
unattached has no business in any part of the stand 
except the one the cheer leader faces. We would 
suggest that the rooting section be moved to the 
center stand in order to concentrate the men to 
better advantage, and give tne leader a better 
chance of seeing what is going on.
We like the spirit in general as well as in particu
lar as we have mentioned. It shows a great im
provement. Keep on improving.
ADVICE TO TENDER ONES.
During the past week the last of the new men, 
with the exception of a comparatively small num
ber of night students, entered. Now that we have 
them all here, the time is ripe for giving' a little 
advice concerning the way we do things here at 
Carnegie Tech. In the first place every Tech man 
remembers at all times and places that he is a Tech 
man, and that Tech men are gentlemen, not fops, 
molycoudles or loud-mouthed college yaps. Tech 
men do not parade the streets in twos and three3 
trying to attract attention, but when it comes time 
to have a demonstration for any reason, Carnegie 
Tech can be depended upon to have the best ex
ample of a well-managed Pe-rade that ever came off 
in this part of the land. Tech men are always open 
to honest, well-meant criticism, and Tech freshmen 
are always liable to a calling down anywhere from 
an upper classman for a breach of good conduct. 
Tech has clean athletics and expects to continue 
to have. All student activities here are run on the 
square and are conducted by men for men. Your 
duty in all things is first to Carnegie Tech, and 
after that in order to your particular school, class 
and section, but first and always to Carnegie Tech. 
If you think you do not like any of the above re
quirements, the best thing you can do is to get out, 
and get out quick; the Registrar has a long waiting 
list. It takes sand to stay here Freshy, it takes 
sand. If you have it dont worry, but if you haven't, 
were just telling you in plenty of time.

TEACHING HORSE SENSE.
In a communication to the Engineering News, 
George H. Follows, Professor of Machine Design at 
the School of Applied Science, Carnegie Technical 
School, Pittsburg, Pa., expresses some ideas regard
ing the teaching of horse sense in technical 
schools, which are of interest to all who have given 
any thought to the question, and which suggest the 
lines along which further improvement may be 
made. One fault with technical instruction as usu
ally imparted is that no sense of values is de
veloped. The technical graduate, as well as the col
lege graduate in general, has but a dim recognition 
of essentials and non-essentials at the time when 
he leaves his Alma Mater. He does not know things 
of prime importance from those of secondary value: 
He has usually an exaggerated idea of the value of 
his college training, and of the knowledge that he 
has assimilated during his years at a technical 
school. When engaging in practical work, he is 
likely not to be able to distinguish a big thing from 
a little thing and at first accomplishes little, because 
he uses up his time and energies with an unprofit
able struggle with trivial matters; in other words, 
he lacks good horse sense.
While it is not possible to teach horse sense in 
the abstract, it is possible to develop a sense of judg
ment in the student provided the instructor himself 
possesses the qualities necessary for imparting such 
instruction. This instruction of common sense can 
be made effective by introducing a course that does 
not deal exclusively with theoretical considerations
but deals with engineering as it actually appears in 
commercial life. The students should be taught that 
mechanical drawing is only a means to an end and 
by no means the end itself. In fact, they ought to 
be taught that engineering itself is only a means to 
an end, and that unless mankind is enabled to live 
happier and better lives as a result of industrial and 
engineering progress, the object to which the en
gineer devotes his energies fails of its purpose. They 
should be given an idea of the organization of en
gineering concerns and be made to understand that 
when they first enter practical life, they will be likely 
to occupy very subordinate positions. Of course, 
with this instruction in shop organization also fol
lows general instruction in shop management and 
shop systems, and efforts should be made to impress 
on the student the true difference between system 
and red tape, that is, in other words, the difference 
between essentials and non-essentials. Last but not 
least, the student who enters practical life from a 
technical school needs to be given an idea of the con
ditions and requirements of the human element in 
the industries and an understanding of the funda
mental principles of economics as they apply to the 
co-operative work of society. It is evident that it is 
difficult to obtain competent instructors for this kind 
of instruction, because experience alone would equip 
a man to teach successfully along these lines; but 
undoubtedly students who had had ideas of this kind 
imparted during their years at school would enter 
practical work with a truer conception of the condi
tions of life than the majority of technical and other 
college graduates now have.Machinery.

Statistics published in the Archiv fr Eisenbahn
wesen give the total mileage of the railways in the 
world as follows: Europe, 199,385 miles; Asia, 56,294 
miles; Africa, 18,519 miles; North America, 2G8,- 
058 miles; South America, 34,911 miles; Australasia, 
17,700 miles. Since 1897 the worlds railway mile
age has increased 140,000 miles or 23.5 per cent. 
The total amount of capital invested in railways ap
proximates $49,000,000,000. This corresponds to an 
investment of $31.50 per each inhabitant of the 
earth.
The annual prize of $5,000 instituted by King 
Leopold, of Belgium, in 1874, will, for the year 1911, 
be awarded for the best work in French, Felmish, 
English, German, Italian, Spanish or Portuguese on 
The progress of aerial navigation, and the most 
effective means for its encouragement. The works 
submitted for competition must reach the Belgian 
Minister for Science and. Art before March 1, 1911.
A correspondent to the Engineering (London) 
calls attention to the fact that there is still in use, 
near Fairbottom, England, a Boulton and Watt en
gine working at three pounds pressure. The require
ments of modern industrial conditions evidently 
have not yet reached that part of the world.
STREET LIGHTING CONDITIONS IN BOSTON.
Electricity won a conspicuous triumph over gas in 
Boston in the spring of this year, when the Edison 
Electric Illuminating Company entered into a fiveyear contract with the city for street lighting, after 
many weeks of strenuous eifort on the part of the 
local gas company to capture the illumination of the 
most important thoroughfares and squares of the 
New England metropolis.
EDISON GOLD MEDAL TO BE AWARDED.
The first award by the American Institute of Elec
trical Engineers of an Edison gold medal will prob
ably be made this fall. Some years ago a fund of 
$5,000 was established by associates and friends of 
Mr. Edison, the annual proceeds of which were to be 
given as prizes for meritorious graduation theses. 
This pian was not found practicable, owing to lack 
of intrinsic merit of the small number of theses that
were submitted, and it was finally decided to estab
lish instead a gold medal, to be awarded whenever 
in the judgment of a committee of the Institute a 
resident of the United States, its dependencies or 
Canadian merits it by discovery, invention or re
search in electricity. The design for the medal has 
been furnished by Mr. James Earle Frazer, a New 
York sculptor. It bears on its obverse a portrait of 
Thomas A. Edison, and on its reverse the legend, 
The Genius of Electricity Crowned by Fame.
The advantages of small additions of vanadium in 
cast iron are referred to by Mr. Kent Smith in the 
Foundry. Small additions of about 0.2 per cent of 
vanadium are advocated, and examples are quoted 
showing the increase in tensile strength due to this 
addition. It also appears that the material does not 
become harder, but that the increase in strength is 
obtained without sacrifice of the ease of working 
the metal. It is mentioned that a locomotive valve 
bushing of vanadium cast iron which has been in 
heavy service for twenty-two months showed no 
signs of abrasive wear, and the original tool marks 
were still in evidence. A pair of chilled rolls having 
0.22 per cent vanadium, showed a wearing life three 
times that of ordinary rolls made by the same firm 
without vanadium.

In the Bureau of Standards, Washington, D. C., 
are doubtless the most sensitive balances in exist
ence. They are used only for comparison and are 
kept, as far as possible, in a room maintained at a 
constant temperature and free from all outside dis
turbing influences. The Bureau of Standards is 
located several miles from the center of \vashington 
in a region comparatively removed from manufactur
ing industries and railroads. The scales or balances 
are enclosed in hermetically sealed cases and the 
weights are manipulated from outside by means of 
levers which are so ingeniously constructed that the 
weights may be transferred to the scale pans and 
then reversed so as to check results. So sensitive 
are these balances that it is necessary for the opera
tor to stand some distance away, as the heat of his 
body will affect the balance and cause it to vary, 
particularly if he stands at one side so that one 
weight is affected by the heat more than the other. 
A curious action has been discovered in the manip
ulation of these delicate balances, which is that a 
minute quantity of air penetrates the pores of the 
balance weights, even though gold plated as is com
mon practice. The inflow and outflow of this minute 
quantity of air at various seasons of the year is said 
to affect the specific gravity of the weights, and to 
be detectable by the balance. On account of the 
variation produced by even such small factors, it is 
strongly advised by the Bureau that all weights 
be made in one piece and not with a screwed handle 
as is a not uncommon practice. The screwed handle 
weight has a small cavity at the bottom of the hole 
into which the handle is screwed, and in this cavity 
and the interstices of the threads is imprisoned a 
small amount of air. The effect of this imprisoned

PLANS FOR AN ARCHITECTURAL MUSEUM
Ambitious plans are under discussion for the con
struction of a great architectural museum at St. 
Louis. It is to be a parta newspaper quotes Hal
sey C. Ives as saying, a commanding feature, 
one absolutely unparalleled elsewhereof the Art 
Museum, of which the main building was a legacy 
from the Fair. A description of the plans, using the 
analogy of a cathedral, says: The present art build
ing and the sunken gardens are to constitute the 
nave; the long connecting corridors the side aisles; 
the offices and library are where the choir would be; 
the auditorium is in the chancels location; while 
the Hall of Architecture is to form the transepts. The 
apse at the right will be devoted to Romanesque 
architecture, and that to the left to the Renaissance. 
Within the lines of the main structure are planned 
ten rectangular sections, each thirty by fifty feet, the 
whole enclosing a court divided into five sections. 
The five sections of the court admit a variety of uses, 
and there need be no haste to fill them;' but the ten 
rectangular alcoves that with the two apses enclose 
this space are already named. Those on the south 
are the Egyptian, Assyrian, Greek, Roman and By
zantine. Those on the nortn are Yucatan, Japanese, 
Indian, Saracenic and Gothic. The plan is that each 
of these alcoves shall be built in its appropriate style, 
the structure being in itself a model of the style of 
architecture it is to contain; and that within it 
shall be grouped models and other appropriate ma
terial relating to its special type of architecture.

HYDROELECTRIC POWER FOR CHATTANOOGA.
Manufacturing in Chattanooga entered on a new 
and greater epoch on June 17th, when electricity 
from the 56,000 horse-power plant at the lock and 
dam was sent over transmission wires into the 
heart of the city. Four years ago the Chattanooga 
and Tennessee River Power company obtained a 
franchise to operate in the city, on condition that 
electricity be sent over the wires in four years, and 
by turning on the current on the 17th the company

GLEE AND MANDOLIN CLUBS.
Sunday, October 17, is the date of the next try-out 
of candidates for the Glee and Mandolin Clubs. All 
men desiring to make an attempt to become mem
bers of either club are requested to come out at that 
time, as they will have a better chance of making 
them now than later. The officers of the clubs have 
been working faithfully during the summer, making 
plans and arrangements for the coming season. It 
is their intention to make this the most successful 
season in the history of either of the clubs, and to 
this end the cooperation of the student body is most 
earnestly desired.
Those having charge of the business arrangements 
of the combined clubs state that several trips at 
Christmas and Easter can be secured. if the men 
will come out for the clubs at once, and allow the 
full rehearsals to begin at once. First tenors are 
especially needed for the Lrlee Club and guitars for 
the Mandolin Club. The rehearsal and the try-out 
takes place Sunday afternoon at 3 oclock.

room 108 of the Applied Science building.
Being the first meeting of the year the usual 
scientific discusions were dispensed with, and the 
evening was devoted to holding an informal reunion 
of old members and to initiating new ones.
Addresses were made by President Light, Secre
tary Poste and Vice President Brill, in which plans 
for securing lecturers for the coming year were 
discussed. Following the usual custom, refreshments 
were served in beakers, evaporating dishes and other 
laboratory apparatus, after which the meeting was 
adjourned.
