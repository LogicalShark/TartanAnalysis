ADMINISTRATION SECURES ARMS AND EQUIPMENT FOR STUDENT REGIMENT
Rifles and Side-Arms Gotten 
By Prof. Keller While 
in Washington
SPECIAL WORK IS PLANNED
The return of Prof. Keller from 
Washington with requisitions for 700 
rifles and accoutrements is the great
est step made to date in the progress 
of military training at Tech. The ar
rival of the arms is expected early 
next week. The Institute was re
quired to file a bond to insure good 
care of this property and the interest 
alone on this bond will cost the Ad
ministration about $350 per year, thus 
showing how much in earnest the In
stitute regards the course. The mat
ter of uniforms was taken up at a 
meeting of section leaders last Sun
day afternoon, and the following com
mittee named to use every means pos
sible to get this very necessary equip
ment:
H. B. Pearce, A. D., Chairman;
G. S. Cole, A. S.
H. M. Lara, A. I.
At the same meeting plans were 
formed to organize the men into a reg
iment. Of this regiment four com
panies, peace strength, ar expected 
from the Science School, two from 
Design School, and two from Indus
tries. All men wishing to try out for 
commissions will take an examination 
at 2 o'clock on the afternoon of Friday, 
A.pril 20. This written examination 
will cover all matter in the Infantry 
Drill Regulations, U. S. A., up to and 
including what is said of the regiment. 
The examining board consists of:
Prof. Stanton, Science, Chairman;
Prof. Leeds, Industries,
Mr. Sternfeldt, Design.
The above committees will make up 
the examination and grade all papers. 
From the men passing this examina
tion, regimental and company officers 
will be selected, the only restriction 
being that officers of the men from 
each school must come from that 
school. The names of men passing 
the examination on subjects up to and 
including the School of the Company, 
-will be certified to the Regimental 
Staff for possible appointment as non
commissioned officers. Copies of the 
Drill Regulations are expected to be 
on sale today in the storeroom.
It is expected that the men will be 
igrouped into companies on next Mon
day morning. This is made necessary 
by the expected early arrival of the 
.arms, and the section leaders will have 
their hands full getting their men 
ready to take up the Manual of Arms. 
The men who are leading the move
ment at present are much gratified by 
the enthusiasm displayed by the stu
dents in the movement. The excep
tional speed attained in whipping the 
detachments into shape has been pos
sible only by the earnest co-operation 
of Plattsburg men, the section leaders 
and the students.
The curriculum committee of the 
Science School has authorized the 
heads of departments to alter their 
courses in Fuch a way that special in
formation of value to officers and men 
of an Engineer Regiment can be given 
in place of the regular work.
PROPOSED LEGISLATION 
AFFECTS ARCHITECTS
Legislation has been proposed es
tablishing a board of seven members 
to issue or reject licenses to appli
cants. The personnel of the board is 
to include four architects and a mem
ber of the faculties of the University 
of Pennsylvania, State College, and 
Carnegie Tech. Graduates of recog
nized schools of architects will not, 
however, be required to take the ex
amination, and will merely pay a li
cense fee of ten dollars. The bill will 
not be retroactive.
M. M. C. S. INSTRUCTOR MAKES WASHINGTON TRIP
Dr. Blair, Miss Hannah, head of the 
Household Economics Department, and 
Miss Pope, instructor in Dietetics, 
were in Washington last week-end. 
The main object of their trip was to 
consult with authorities as to how the 
Womans School could best help 
whether as a whole or by departments 
i. e., sewing, making menus and 
plans for equipping kitchens, etc. 
Both Dr. Blair and Miss Hannah have 
been instrumental in increasing the 
Red Cross membership in the school.

INDUSTRIES ALUMNI ENTERTAIN SENIORS
The day and night Senior Classes 
of the Industries School were the 
guests of the Industries Alumni Asso
ciation at an informal get-togotlier 
meeting and smoker held last even
ing in the club room of the Industries 
School. Short talks were made by 
members of the Alumni Association, 
and several of the Seniors. Plans for 
the future were also discussed and 
another such meeting will probably be 
held before graduation.
MIDDLE CLASSMEN TO HOLD SPRING DANCE
On Friday evening, in Carnegie 
Union, the Middle Class of the Indus
tries' School will hold their spring 
dance. The program will consist of 
twenty dances, with four extras, and 
the -Nossokoff-Maggio Orchestra of 
four pieces .will furnish the music for 
the occasion. The price of admission 
is $1.00 per couple and all Industries 
men are invited.

NIGHT DRAMATISTS 
STAGE FOUR PLAYS
As the temperature increases the 
baseball fans are beginning to howl 
for action on the diamond, and they 
are soon to have action, as Carnegie 
Tech opens next Monday with Juniata. 
Judging from the drubbing Penn State 
gave Juniata on the State College 
grounds last Saturday, Tech should j 
have a very good chance of tucking | 
away the opening game.
We do not mean, however, that we I 
are sure of it. ; Several weak spots in 
the team must be bolstered up or the 
pill might leak through a few times 
too often, where it would possibly do 
some damage. First base and third 
base are the two obstacles that con
front Coach McCullough just at the 
present time. Hedlund and Withers, 
two new men, are out for first,- while 
Goth and Baker make up the material j 
for third. Kesner, the football star, i 
who played third base two years ago, j 
has decided to play in the garden j 
this year, which position he held very j 
creditably before being used to bridge j 
the gap at third.

performance of the season in Theater 
of School of Applied Design, I> riday

audience.
The bill was made up of four short 
plays, Simoon, by Strindberg and 
Percival Wildes Playing With Fire, 
under the personal direction of Mr. 
Flood, and -'Suppressed Desires, a 
collaboration by Geo. Cram Cook "and 
Susan Glaspell, and a tragedy of the 
future, very appropriately called 
Food, under the personal direction 
of Mr. Beatty.
Of August Strindbergs morbid play, 
which strikes one (especially in the 
hands of amateurs) as transgressing 
all the canons of art, the less said the 
better. The only feature of the play 
one would wish to recall is the stage 
setting, which had a certain dignity, 
and the lighting, which afforded what 
atmosphere there was to the piece. 
Such material is safe only in the hands 
of consummate artists.

NEW QUARTER MILE TRACK 
COMPLETED FOR MEET
Techs new quarter-mil'e track, which 
has been a great need and an intangi
ble dream for a long time is, at last, 
a reality. The last part of the work 
was completed a day or two ago, giv
ing Tech one of the best outdoor 
tracks in this part of the country. For 
the foundation, the field was scooped 
out for about six inches and heavy 
cinders laid. On top of these was 
placed a layer of fine cinders, giving 
the track good drainage, a good bed, 
and a firm, even surface.
Work was held up considerably the 
first part of spring owing to the bad 
weather, and it looked for a time as 
though it would not be ready for the 
first meet. It is ready, however, and 
will be used by a meet, for the first 
time this afternoon, when the Plebes 
from the three schools will hold the 
inter-plebe meet. It will be used 
again on Friday, April 20, for the interscliool meet, the annual event that 
shows which school can produce the 
best track material.
INTER-PLEBE MEET 
THIS AFTERNOON
Track activities for the season will 
start this afternoon at 4:30, when the 
Plebe classes from the three schools 
will hold the Inter-PIebe meet. The 
entries for this meet show a lot of 
enthusiasm, Science leading with the 
largest number, and Industry follow
ing a close second. Preliminary try
outs will have to be held in a good 
many of the events, owing to the num
ber entering. The new-quarter-mile 
cinder track will be used for the first 
time in the meet this afternoon, it just 
being completed a day or two ago.
Events for this afternoons meet 
will be as follows:
100-yard dash High hurdles
220-yard dash High jump
440-yard dash Pole vault
Mile relay Broad jump
Half-mile run Discus
One-mile run Hammer
Two-mile run Shot

McCURDY WINS 125 CLASS
MAYVIEW VISITED BY 
BAND S FIRST TOUR
Saturday night found Carnogie 
Tech opening its wrestling season 
with Westlnghouse Club team as their 
opponents. A very creditable showing 
indeed was givon the spectators by 
Tssch, considering that it was their 
first offense.
Fleming for Tech lost to Baker in 
the heavyweight match, but Avon in 
the 155-pound class. Nolther of the 
two had a fall, but Fleming was given 
a decision on points.
McCurdy tugged with his opponont 
in the 125-pound class for three min
utes, when the Westlnghouse man 
forfeited the match to him by retiring 
from the mat.
Clements and Williams both lost 
their matches, Clements wrestling In 
the 135-pound class and Williams In 
the 45.
Westlnghouse forfeited the 115- 
pound class match to Tech, thereby 
giving three to oach club, Tech win
ning the 115, 125 and 155-pound, 
while to Westlnghouse went the hon
ors of the 135, 145. and heavyweight 
classes. The ^coro of the meet was 
15 to 18, in favor of the East Pitts
burgh aggregation.
SOUTHERN CLUB GIVES 
PREPAREDNESS DANCE
Last Saturday night the Southern 
Club entertained quite a number of 
its friends with a preparedness 
dance. Many unique and appropriate 
features were presented, principally 
among which were the red, white and 
blue decorations. Large American 
Flags were draped over the doors, the 
piano and in the most conspicuous 
places, while a net-work of red, white 
and blue paper decorations swung 
overhead. The programs were artis
tically designed and appropriately 
gotten up for the patriotic occurrence. 
At the beginning of the dance a grand 
march was held, during which paper 
hats of military design were given 
out.
Patriotic pieces were sung and 
played through the whole program, and 
it seemed as If only a few moments, 
existed between 8:30 and midnight, for 
Sunday morning came entirely too 
soon. Although much against the 
wishes of all the participants, Nireilas 
Orchestra stopped promptly at that 
specified timethus ending another 
most enjoyable evening at the home of 
the Southern Club.
EMPLOYMENT PROSPECTS 
BRIGHT FOR GRADUATES
Mr. McCorkle has recently had most 
promising interviews with some of the 
large employers of labor in the coun
try and has made definite arrange
ments with some of them to place our 
graduates advantageously. Last week 
the General Electric Company, the 
YVestinghouse Electric and Manufac
turing Company, and the^Cutler-Hammer Company were among the big con
cerns who sent representatives to the 
Bureau of Recommendations to look 
up men. Recently Mr. McCorkle has 
been in New York and Philadelphia at
tending the Convention of Employ
ment Managers and interviewing other 
large employers.
JUNIOR BANQUET SET 
FOR APRIL 25TH
The Junior Class Banquet, which is 
a new event in Tech, is to be held In 
the Dutch Room of the Fort Pitt Ho
tel, on Wednesday, April 25, at 7 
oclock. Considerable interest has 
been taken In this affair, due in a 
great extent to the present war, 
which will no doubt have a marked 
effect on next year's Senior Class, 
The committee has been at work and 
are at present working out a program 
of entertainment which will contain 
the best talent that is to be had any
where. Invitations have been sent out 
to the Det.ii and ex-Dean as well as to 
the various departmental heads, and 
It Is hoped that they will help by lend
ing their presence. The committee 
consists of L. M. Collins, chairman; 
J. E. Bowler, L. II. Hale, G. T. Hunter 
and E. T. Obert.
The first trip of the C. I. T. Band 
was in every respect a success. The 
authorities at Marshalsea, now known 
as Mayvlew, declare that the Band 
furnished the best entertainment given 
so far this year.
The big feed," which was the re
muneration for the services of the or
ganization, was Indeed a treat. Little 
surprise, when It Is known that Miss 
Ruth Pontius, graduate of Margaret 
Morrison, 1(5, lias been appointed head 
dietitian of the Institution! Miss 
Pontius was givon a moanlngfull 
short speller at the end of the sup
per.
The engagement was made possible 
through the efforts of George Watson, 
secretary to the Band, who Is now 
working on the necessary arrange
ments to take the Band to Butler, Pa., 
In co-operation with the Gloo ClifT).
It is hoped that Mr. Sullvan, direc
tor, will bo again with the club next 
year. Through Ills leadership the 
Band has made wonderful strides 
within the past season, and with the 
co-operation of the students can make 
an organization of playors second to 
none of the college bands throughout 
the country.
MAY DAY FESTIVAL

SEVERAL STUDENTS ENLIST
At the last general assembly, Lieut. 
Col. Edgar Jadwin, United States En
gineer for the Pittsburgh district, an
nounced that there was rouin for at 
least 100 Tech students in the En
gineers Enlisted Reserve Corps of the 
United States Army. In the course of 
his address Col. JadWln remarked that 
the courses being taken by many of 
the students at Carnegie Tech fit rliem 
for service in the Engineer Regiment.
Up to the time of The Tartans go
ing to press, six Tech students have 
enlisted in this corps and will be as
signed to the Army Engineer Regi
ment. The new recruits are:
J. E. Kesner 
G. G. Gulich 
M. V. Mansfield 
J. W. Towns 
Ronald J. Goodshell 
Fred C. Langbein.
Three men, two Seniors and one 
Sophomore, have enlisted in the Naval 
Reserves. These men are Carnegie, 
Madison and W. W. Craig.
There are other Tech students who 
have qualified for enlistment but who 
must undergo a medical examination 
before being accepted.
The Engineer Regiment affords op
portunities for those students who 
have had experience as topographical 
surveyors and mechanical draftsmen, 
photographers and blueprint men, ma
chinists and electricians. There are 
also, In oach company, two clerks and 
two buglers.
The only requirement imposed by 
enlistment In this roglmont Is that 
members are subject, In time of peaco, 
to being called for 15 days training 
per year, and In time of national emer
gency for such service as may be re* 
qulred.
The advantages afforded by enlist
ment aro as follows:
1. In time of war, the men will un
doubtedly bo callod on for sorvlce be
fore other volunteers.
2. All subsistence, equipment, uni
forms, and transportation aro fur
nished to the men by the Government.
3. Aftor ono oncampmont the men 
are ontltlod to wear a distinctive 
rosotto which other persons are pro
hibited from wearing under penalty 
of the law.
4. When called Into service, either 
In peaco or war, the men receive pay 
according to Lliolr rospoptlvo ranks.
Tills pay -varies from $15.00 for an 
ordinary private and $18.00 for a pri
vate of the first class, to $75.00 a 
month for a master mechanic.
For further Information regarding 
the Englnoors Reserve Corps, ono 
should apply either to Capt. Stanton, 
of the Science School, or to Lieutonant 
E. F. Archibald, a Tech graduate, who 
is in charge of the recruiting office at 
2101 Farmers Bank Building.
The importance of the service ren
dered by army engineers is becoming 
more and more emphasized in modern 
warfare and Tech students who enlist 
in this corps will render a great serv
ice to the nation, besides gaining val
uable experience.

FIFTH CONCERT GIVEN 
BEFORE LARGE AUDIENCE
The fifth in the series of seven con
certs scheduled for the Department of 
Music was given Friday afternoon at 
4:30 oclock in Theater of School of 
Applied Design, when a very interest

Curry), Viola (Mr. Bellingham), was 
a very enjoyable performance, being 
given, an Intelligent and muslclanly 
reading, with considerable artistic 
finish. The Rondo movement Is es
pecially rich In texturea fact the 
playors seemed to fully appreciate 
while, they displayed both taste and 
skill In the First movement In roHtralntlng tone and sustaining a fine 
balance.
The Bach Aria for 'Cello brought 
Miss Allx Elnert again before the pub
lic and confirmed the favorable Im

Rid Cress Unit in 
M. M. C. S.
In view of the pending arrangements 
which are being made by the girls in 
the M. M. C. S. for forming a Red 
Cross unit, one of the classes of the 
School of Applied Science has decided 
to give an all-school dance in the 
Music Hall Foyer, on Friday, May 11, 
with the object in view of turning 
over the proceeds of this dance to the 
M. M. C. S. Red Cross Unit.
Although the Red Cross Unit has 
not as yet been definitely formed, the 
plans, under the direction of Dr. Blair, 
are well under way. Dr. Blair went to 
Washington last week for the purpose 
of making necessary arrangements 
and acquiring first-hand Information 
as to the organization of Ibis unit., 
and It Is practically certain that such 
a unit will be definitely formed.
The girls of the M. M. C. S. have 
responded very enthusiastically to the 
call for this work, and are receiving 
the greatest commendation for their 
spirit and work about the campus.. 
About 125 girls aro now actively pre
paring themselves for the Red Cross.

BASEBALL AND TRACK
For the past several years.the two major spring sports, baseball 
and track, have not been supported by the attendance of any large 
percentage of the student body. The same situation seems to exist in 
practically all of our colleges, especially in regard to baseball, and 
many of them iiave considered dropping the national game entirely. 
Just why the student body of Carnegie Tech should follow the genera] 
bad example is difficult to understand. We give the football team all 
the encouragement that could be desired; we patronize the basketball 
games until the gymnasium is filled to capacity. Why not be fair to 
the other athletes?
Unless indications are incorrect, Tech may prepare for a success
ful season in both baseball and track. For one thing, the schedules 
are much more attractive than in previous years. In baseball particu
larly the games appear to be well balanced, for we begin next Monday 
with a fairly easy contest with Juniatawhom Penn State has al
ready defeated 13 to 0and progress to more difficult games with 
some of the best college teams in the country. Probably the most 
attractive feature of the schedule, from the standpoint of student 
interest, is the game with Michigan, this being the first occasion for a 
meeting between the two schools. The track schedule, f urthermore, 
appears equally inviting. Unless further postponement is necessary, 
this week will see the season begin with a rush, for there are both the 
intor-Plcbc and the inter-school meets. Tryouts for the Penn games 
will follow soon after; victory, even, in our division relay at Philadel
phia does not seem beyond our grasp.
This year gives us our first opportunity to observe the results ol! 
the new system of coaching in these two sports with Coaches McCiilloch and Eyman. Their candidates give every promise of working 
together successfully. The quality of play will undoubtedly be im
proved in turn by the improvements in. the field. Everything, in fact, 
seems to bo furnishing reasons for roncwed and enlivened student 
interest in both baseball and track.
THE BEANERY AGAIN
Some weeks ago The Tartan pointed out the fact that under
classmen wore disregarding the regulation which sets aside certain 
labios in the Beanery for faculty and seniors. This disobedience was 
the more deplorable in that it completely disregarded the large type 
notices placed near the reserved tables to announce the rule. Since 
that time the Science Seniors have made several raids upon the tables 
in order to clear them of underclassmen, and apparently their work 
has been effective.
Once again we have a suggestion to make in regard to the Bean
ery. There are many students who eat in the lunch room but bring 
their lunches from home. These men have lately acquired the very 
bad habit of scattering the paper in which their food was wrapped on 
the tables or on the floor, or anywhere except in the baskets where it 
belongs. In the first place, to leave the remains of ones lunch on the 
table or to throw them at a basket but not into it is highly disgusting 
from the standpoint of tidiness. In the second place it leaves much 
unnecessary work for the students who happen to be working in the 
lunch room at the time. A little fellow feeling for these helpers 
would go a long way in this matter; indeed, it ought not be necessary 
to mention it at all. Unlike the affair of the Senior tables, this regula
tion is not displayed on placards about the room; but still one ought 
not need any such incentive to keep the place from being- cluttered 
with refuse. We hope that the negligence will be corrected in this case 
as rapidly and effectively as it was in the case of the Senior tables; 
this time, however, there is no need for enforcement by any particular 
group of men, but merely care on the part of the lunchers themselves.
THE FIRST WRESTLING TEAM
Carnegie Techs first real venture into the field of wrestling came 
last Saturday evening in the contest with Westinghouse Club. The 
result was all that could be desired for a first attempt, since each team 
won three matches, but Westinghouse received the decision for the 
whole contest on points. Each man on the team gave a creditable 
performance, and they all deserve to receive that same loyal support 
which is characteristic of Tech.
Support means, as in all activities, attendance at the games. But 
with wrestling, more perhaps than with any other sport, it means 
actual participation. There are few means of exercising which surpass 
wrestling for effective physical benefit. That fact has been known 
many years; wrestling was one of the chief trials through which the 
ancient Spartan youth had to pass. Today practically every large 
college in the country has its wrestling team, and in each the sport is 
gaining in popularity. Some colleges of our own kind, Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology, for example, have made rather a specialty of 
it. So the athletic authorities are to be commended for their efforts to 
put Carnegie Tech on the wrestling map, especially when we have so 
much talent here that we can make the very creditable record of last 
Saturday night.
The first annual Art Pilgrimage is 
over and gone, and eight students of 
the Department of Painting and Dec
orating in Design School are still sit
ting up nights to talk of the sights 
they saw and the things they did in 
Little Old New York. For without 
a doubt It was some big time. The 
way they covered the ground makes 
us wonder if they slept at all.
The party was made up this year of 
Forrest C. Crooks and Emiiine Smith, 
representing the Illustrators; Ray
mond Siinboli and Wilfred Radio, of 
the Painters; Clifford Bayard and 
Esther Topp, of the Teachers Course, 
and Jeijnie Bailey and H. R. Trout, of 
the Decorators. The students were 
especially fortunate in having for their 
escorts Mr. and Mrs. R. T. DeQuelin, 
through whose influence they were 
admitted to places where otherwise 
they would never, have gone.
The Pilgrims started out for New 
York on March 30, and returned April 
9. While in New York they visited 
the studios of Mr. Blachfield and Mr. 
Dodge, both well known mural paint
ers. Then the Covey etchings and 
mural paintings were seen in the 
making. They next went to the home 
of the famous Tiffany silverware. 
Here they were accorded special priv
ileges through Mr. De Quelin, who is 
head of the designing department. At 
the shop of P. W. French & Co. they 
got a glimpse at some of the fine tap
estries and real antiques. At the Butterick Building they inspected some 
of the original work of the "fashionsmiths, and saw the illustrators at 
work, turning out the pictures for the 
McCalls Magazine. They, of course, 
made a hurried inspection of the Met
ropolitan and Spanish Museums, and 
then started back.
They stopped in Philadelphia, where 
they visited all the points of interest, 
and saw the famous "Garden of 
Dreams, a glass mosaic, in the Curtis 
Publishing Company Building, done by 
Maxfield Parrish.
Even artists on an Art Pilgrimage 
cant spend all their time in studios 
and museums. At least these artists 
couldnt. While in New York they 
took one night off and went to see 
Miss Annette -Kellerman perform in 
her glass tank.
In the short span of ten days it was 
impossible for the Pilgrims to see 
everything. What to see and what not 
not to see, was a question that was 
settled without hesitancy under the 
guidance of Mr. DeQuelin. The stu
dents realize fully the obligation as 
expressed in the following letter:
To Mr. and Mrs. R. T. DeQuelin:
We all wish to express our appre
ciation of your kindness during the 
entire trip. We feel that with you as 
the head of our party we had many 
advantages which otherwise we would 
not have known.
That we are, to say it briefly, ap
preciative both of your services and 
thankful that we were all privileged 
to go, with you as chaperones of the 
party, and sure of the advantages you 
showed us, we wish to here sign our 
names, which only partially expresses 
our pleasure of the trip.
Wo are glad we have had the trip 
and shall always remember it with 
pleasure.
Signed.
INDUSTRIES NIGHT 
SENIORS HOLD BANQUET
The members of the Night Senior 
Class of the School of Applied Indus
tries held their annual banquet last 
Saturday evening at the Pittsburgh 
Athletic Association. A very pleasing 
menu was served, after which R. J. 
Patterson, president of the class, 
acted as toastmaster and called on 
many of those present ror short talks. 
This part of the program was inter
spersed with the singing of numerous 
songs.
The invited guests were Director 
Hamersclilag, Dean Connelley, Uncle 
John Brashear, F. W. Crouch, Prof. 
Cr C. Leeds, W. H. Dosey, Prof. H. 
Calderwood, G. A. Bisbee, J. S. Dodds 
and F. J. Hartman. The committee 
also sent an invitation to Mr. Car 
negie. The letter received in reply 
follows; it expressing the warm in
terest held by Mr. Carnegie in the 
students at Tech.
Dear Sirs: 
Mr. Carnegie desires me to thank 
you warmly for your very kind favor 
of March 30, which has been received 
here today. He says that such words 
of appreciation as yours more than 
compensate him for his efforts on be
half of technical education.
Were it possible to do so, Mr. Car
negie would be very glad to attend 
the banquet on the 14th of this 
month, but unfortunately he has been 
ordered by his doctor to refrain for 
the present from all correspondence 
and other activities.
Very truly yours,
J. A. POYNTON, 
Secretary

DR. BRASHEAR IN CHINA
H. B. Keeler, Civil, 13, writes from 
China that he did not have an oppor
tunity to see Dr. Brashear on his trip 
to the Orient. He is enjoying his work 
with the Standard Oil Company very 
much, but living conditions in China 
are not all that could be desired.
WIRELESS APPARATUS 
HAS BEEN DISMANTLED
The wireless outfits in Machinery 
Hall Tower have all been dismantled, 
in accordance with the Governments 
orders concerning amateur stations. 
At first it was thought that the Gov
ernment might take over Tech's radio 
apparatus, since it is so powerful, but 
since then a circular letter has been 
received with only the orders to dis
mantle. In case the station ever 
should be taken over, there are suffi
cient experienced operators in school 
now to man it.
ENGINEERS SOCIETIES 
HOLD JOINT MEETING
There will be a joint meeting of the 
student clubs of the departments of 
Electrical, Mechanical and Metallur
gical and Mining Engineering, on Wed
nesday evening, April 18, at 8 oclock, 
in the 209, Science Building. Mr. Paul 
B. Liebermann, Chief Engineer of the 
Hyatt Roller Bearing Co., will speak 
on the subject, "Roller Action vs. 
Sliding Friction. Anyone interested, 
especially Plebes, will be cordially wel
come. There will be no assessment.

RED CROSS BENEFIT DANCE
ON FRIDAY, MAY 11TH
(Continued from Page One) 
the proposal of giving a dance for the 
Red Cross benefit, and commended 
the spirit which prompted this move 
in the Science School. Miss Hanna, of 
the Household Economics Department, 
who is closely associated with this 
work, expressed the highest approval 
of the idea of giving a dance for this 
purpose. There is no doubt that this 
social function, given for the purpose 
of aiding the girls and the Red Cross 
movement at Tech will be well at
tended.
FIFTH CONCERT GIVEN
BEFORE LARGE AUDIENCE
(Continued From Page uneO 
a new candidate for public favor and 
proved himself worthy of a hearing, 
playing with a sureness of attack and 
ease that is unusual in a first appear
ance. His tone was clean and his in
terpretation intelligent. His name 
will be Very welcome in future pro
grams.
Miss Helen Eyles played two piano 
numbers, Rachmaninoffs Barcarolle in 
G Minor, and his Valse in A Ma
jor, which were most cordially re
ceived. She elicits a very lovely tone 
from her instrument, in every sense 
musical; her attack is sure and her 
stage-presence graceful.
The Beethoven Sonata for Cello 
Mr. Geo. Curry, Cello, Mr. McGowan, 
Pianowas one of the very interesting 
numbers of the afternoon performance. 
In certain passages, Mr. Curry evoked 
from ilia instrument, tones rich and 
smooth as velvet. His work is at times 
erratic, but always interesting from 
the fact that lie shows himself to be 
no worshiper at the shrine of tradi
tion.
The closing number, Mendelssohns 
Trio in D MinorViolin (Miss Man
or), 'Cello (Mr. Curry), Piano (Miss 
Hennig), was delightfully played and 
brought forth hearty applause.
The next concert will be given Sun
day evening, May 6.
NIGHT DRAMATISTS
STAGE FOUR PLAYS
(Continued From Page One.) 
which was one of the very best "bits 
of character work of the eveningbe
ing delightful in its naturalness and 
simplicity. Anne Cochrane as "Madge, 
the half-grown girl, did viuite a clever 
piece of acting, and "looked the part 
to the life. Mr. Thomas Whites 
Danny, the stripling, just awakening 
to romance, was very acceptably done. 
The play met with cordial applause.
Unquestionably, "Suppressed De
sires (what might be- termed a 
psychological satire) was the "piece 
de resistance of the evening, meeting 
with rounds of laughter and applause. 
The cast entered into the play with 
commendable vigor and made it "go 
from start to finish. Florence Henry, 
as Henrietta, the psychological devo
tee, was most convincing. She has a 
good voice and enunciates clearly and 
is quite devoid of the mannerisms 
which so often spoil otherwise clever 
acting. Her work will be very pleas
antly remembered. Miss Blanche 
Levy, as Mabel, the innocent victim 
of this insidious science, was very in
teresting and amusingparticularly at 
the close of the first scene, where she 
drops ' the weighty scientific tome, 
staring wildly into space as she ex
claims, Am I unhappy? Mr. Leo 
Robin did very good work as "Ste
phen, the husband of "Henriette. 
This gentleman was not a believer in 
Complexs" and the like, and found 
his home atmosphere oppressive, as it 
was heavily surcharged with psycho
logical data. The denouement is most 
interesting and very funny. There 
should be a special performance given 
for the Department of Psychological 
Research.

The final play, Food, came just at 
the psychological moment to attract 
attention. It was extremely funny and 
at the same time painfully apropos 
with prices soaring like sky-rockets. 
The play deals with conditions fifty 
years hence when eggs and diamonds 
shall have changed values. JMiss 
Sweeney as Irene was an interesting 
character. She always acts with a 
certain finish and cleverness. Mr. H. 
Patterson as Basil, her husband, 
gave her excellent support. Mr. Ken
neth Thompson had really no oppor
tunity to display any histrionic ability, 
however much he may possess, while 
Miss Abrams was most unfortunately 
cast in the first play. She has a very 
fUll, strong voice, but her native 
accent is yet too evident for her to 
succeed in a role sucli as "Biskra, an 
Arabian girl. One anticipates the time 
wh- she will be more congenially 
cast.
Everything considered, the Night 
Students gave a very good account of 
themselves and another performance 
by them will be looked forward to 
with pleasure.
BASEBALL SEASON OPENS

mainstay behind the batter, with 
Schumley and -Warner, two subs of 
last year, as capable assistants.
To Doherty goes the territory around 
shortstop position, for heseems to 
have no rivals; in fact, it would be 
necessary for a rival to have won
derful ability in order to unseat 
"Doc from his berth.
Shorty Miller seems to be the best 
prospect hovering around second so 
far this season. The outfield material 
is more than plentiful. With Kesner, 
Yeager, Gano, Lundell and Sachs, to
gether with the new material which 
includes Levy and Abrams, of basket
ball fame, it is merely a matter of 
choice. Cosgrove, who last year os
cillated between the garden and 
pitchers box, is always dependable.
To have a winning team, however, 
it is necessary to have more than a 
good team. It must have the loyal 
support of every man in school. Base
ball has been a falling off sport at 
Tech for the last two years on account 
of the quality of the baseball played. 
But this year Ave have the material, 
and with some of the best schools 
available coming here to play, base
ball should take on more significant 
proportions. Therefore, all ye loyal 
rooters, when the old umpire hollers 
P-l-a-y B-a-1-1 next Monday afternoon, 
it is hoped that you will be there to 
see the best team the Plaid has ever 
placed on the diamond.

COMEDY DISGUISE REVEL 
TO TAKE PLACE OF BALL
The students of the Design School 
are planning for another ball, a Com
edy Disguise Revel, to be held in the 
Foyer on Thursday, April 26. It will 
be an early affair and quite informal, 
beginning at 8 oclock and. lasting 
until 1. All design students should 
attend. Splendid music will be fur
nished and everyone will have one of 
the best times of his young life.
Any kind of costume may be worn, 
but every participant must be dis
guised. Anyone not disguised will not 
be permitted on the floor. Prizes will 
be given for the cleverest'get-up 
Each student will be assessed one 
dollar. This entitles him to bring one 
outsider.
The "Revel is being given to make 
up a deficit incurred by the Slavonic 
Ball, because every student did not 
pay dues. All students are urged to 
show their loyalty by paying their as
sessments and receiving passes now.
See the committee member in your 
department. The committee consists, 
of Harry Aspinwall, Harry Bremmer,. 
John Todd and "Mox Polmeyer, in 
the Department of Architecture; Maybelle Beadling and Lois McMahon, of 
Painting and Decoration; BeatriceHeinrich, in Music Department, and 
Hans Muller and Arleigh Williamson,,

C.!.T.DEBATING SOCIETY CHIEFS OF UNCLE SAMS FIGHTING forces 
DISBANDS FOR PRESENT
The C. I. T. Debating Society has 
decided to disband and devote its time 
and energy to aiding the military drill 
instituted last week.
President Cheswick, of the society, 
said: The patriotic convictions of
the Society . members impel us to de
vote our efforts to military affairs. A 
formal meeting endorsing this action 
is all that is necessary now. This is 
one more indication that the majority 
of the students are in favor of the mil
itary drill which is now well under 
way. While the morning drill would 
in no way interfere with the meetings 
of the Debating Society, the members 
could not, devote time to both activi
ties, and they consider the drill of 
greater importance at this period.
TRUSTEES PURCHASE 
ADDITIONAL PROPERTY
According to a statement issued last 
week, the Board of Trustees has pur
chased the E. M. Kuhn residence on 
Forbes street, near Morewood avenue. 
The property adjoins the McGinley 
property, which is now being leveled 
off so rapidly, and enlarges the school's 
holdings in the vicinity of the Morewood avenue extension. The building 
is a large, substantial brick structure, 
occupying a lot a hundred and thirty 
feet by two hundred and twenty-five 
feet. The price is said to have been 
over forty thousand dollars.
Work on the McGinley property is 
progressing rapidly. Already an ap
preciable portion of the hill has been 
cut away, and the dirt dumped into the 
hollow between. The house is com
pletely demolished,-and thus an old 
landmark is lost to the neighborhood.
W000LAWN CLUB HOLDS 
DANCE AT NEW HOME
The Woodlawn Club entertained 
with a delightful dinner dance in their 
new home, corner of Forbes street and 
Murray avenue, last Friday evening, 
April 13.
t The house was decorated in patri
otic colors, which harmonized with the 
favors given at the dinner. An enjoy
able evening was occasioned by some 
thirty couples.
The patronesses were: Mrs. A. C.
Farr, Mrs. M. P. Smith, Mrs. W. W. 
Headings, Mrs. A. C. VanDylce, and 
Mrs. J. C. Hobbs.
The committee in charge was: 
Messrs. G. R. Brandin, R. N. Jones 
and J. J. Pannabaker.
The Woodlawn Club cordially in
vites its friends to visit them in their 
new home, at 5814 Forbes street.
INTER-SCHOOL MEET 
COMING NEXT FRIDAY
The annual Inter-School meet will 
be held next Friday, April 20, on the 
Tech field, at 4:30. From the number 
of entries already signed up, there is 
going to be a hard fight for the school 
carrying off the greatest number of 
honors, and from the past records of 
some of those who have shown their 
intention of competing, there is going 
to be some good exhibitions of track 
and field work, and the three schools 
are so evenly matched in ability that 
it is impossible at this time to make 
the least kind of a prediction as to 
which school is going to be the win
ner of the day. This will be the sec
ond meet to be held on Techs new 
track, and with this as an aid it can 
safely he said that many of the old 
school records will be broken.
The following events will be held:
100-yard dash 
220-yard dash

A student with college spirit wants to see his 
College paper the equal or superior of other college 
papers. For him to merely sit by and let the other 
fellow work will not accomplish this.
The success of a college daily depends as much 
upon the ability of the management to get in 
money as it does upon the editorial staff to fill 
up the news columns.
Only so long as the students read the advertise

My Dear Arthur: 
How often I think o you and your 
dear ones at home, as alo your big 
family at Tech, and I 83 often regret 
that my strenuous life in the Orient 
has prevented me from writing more 
personal letter than I have been able 
to write, and yet to put it grossly, J 
have used up two pretty big bottles 
of Watermans Ink, and have written 
enough words to almost complete my 
ldng-delayed autobiography.
I brought the last words I wrote of 
that proposed volume, hoping to add 
several chapters on my journey, but 
alas for poor biography. Of course, 
I trust my letters to our Pittsburgh 
papers will help someas I have given 
a brief of my Itinerary until we left 
China, and hope to send two more, 
but this does not seem like personal 
communication with my dear friends 
at home.
I have received two letters from you 
since coming over, and I believe have 
written one to you, after arriving at 
Hong Kong after our Manila trip, 
which was all too short, for we were 
received so kindly there. We went to 
Canton, where our friend Dr. Edmunds, 
of the Johns Hopkins University, is at 
the head of the Canton Christian Col
lege, where Swasey has built a fine 
Convocation Iia, 11 to be used as a 
chapel, etc., at least for the present. 
Here I lectured to' 900 Chinese and 
foreignersall outside the Chinese are 
considered foreigners. This lecture 
did not require the services of an in
terpreter, as all had a fair knowledge, 
of English; but the next afternoon 
Sundaymy lecture to 1,200 Chinese 
at the Y. M. C. A. building, had to be 
interpreted, so I had the good fellow 
who interpreted for me come up to 
the collegethree miles up the river 
and I coached him so well that I told 
him, after the talk, he could beat me 
all to pieces. Indeed'/it'is really aston
ishing how one of" these educated 
Chinese take hold of a subject, even 
though it may not be in his line of 
study. The young man was a Yale 
graduate, and I just laid my hand on 
Ills shoulder, talked loud enough to 
him to be heard by the one hundred 
foreignersi. e., the part of lecture 
preceding the picturesand It pleased 
me to see how enthusiastic he repeat
ed my yarn to the Chinese, present.
And yet, Chinese listeners are far 
from demonstrative. You can see by 
their countenances how they appre
ciate, but It is only at the conclusion, 
when the foreigners raise a row, that 
they join in with clapping of hands.
However, when I made an address 
at the dedication of Swaseys Science 
Hall at Nan King, at the close I said, 
"By Jiminie, I like you fellows, the 
Interpreter repeated It, verbatim et 
llteratum, and while they didnt know 
the difference between by Jiminie 
and by damrosh, they did get the 
idea it was something meant to show 
my liking for the Chinese. They did 
surely raise a row for quite a while 
and the staid President Bowen and his 
staff, Booing how the students took it, 
Joined in with the crowd.
That night at the Chinese dinner 
given by the Alumn'ao, the Chairman 
introduced mo as "Uncle John and the 
by Jiminie good follow"; well, there
was some funInnocent fun...that
nightnot 83 much to the Alumnae as 
to M8 follows --Swasey., Freeman, the 
Freeman boyH (grads, of Mass. Tech.) 
and our friend, Dr. Williams,'V. 1., of 
the college, who came with us from 
the U. S.
Gee, I wish our orchestra leader 
could have hoard some of the pieces 
(lie alumnae orchestra played that 
night! 1 had the back ache next day 
so badly that the only way 1 could ac
count for It was that some of the sec
tions of my back bone were injured by 
the shivers sent up and down my 
spinal column by those awful, awful 
discords. I am almost afraid to call 
them up in my memory, as.it is told 
us the brain has direct connection 
with spinal cord!
1 have heard four or five Chinese 
orchestras now, and while some of 
them did fairly well for Chinamen, 
some of them would shiver a poorlyannealed glass window. As our crowd 
of good fellows usually leave it to me 
to congratulate the orchestra, you 
can imagine how I either have to lie, 
or prevaricate to do the job.
Well, it is certainly interesting to 
learn how these Oriental people are 
anxious to study for their betterment 
and the betterment of their people, 
and I would like to tell you the story 
of how they have taken up the educa
tion of their back country people by 
ocular-physical demonstration. The 
Freemans and I spent two or three 
hours at the demonstration rooms of 
the Y. M. C. A., in Shanghai, and it 
was most, interesting to see the curi
ous moans that, were used to get at hto 
country people,, i'll give you one of 
their experiments: On a table there
wore throe dopartmonts of what ed
ucation moans to Chinese young men, 
and what is should moan, a square 
copper boiler about 12x12, had a gas 
jot under it. to raise steam. The 
steam came out in a jot; and drove a 
disc around by pressure against a cup 
on the edge. There were Chinese 
characters around the face of the disc 
which expressed the desire of so 
many, the majority of young men who 
?ot their education abroad to enter 
qllicial life as secretary to some one 
in the government service. This disc 
was started to revolve slowly, but the 
tile vtfrj" vivJio . was giving us the
demonstration told us to watch for 
the consequence.
Four discs rotated by two boilers 
were figured to represent education, 
conservation, sanitation and morals, 
all of which should be brought to 
China by the young graduate students 
from America, England, France, etc. 
Each one by itself did not have nearly 
as high a value as If worked in con
junction with the others, and were so 
connected up, they only worked nicely 
wiien all were turning and helping the 
others.
And now for the denouement, as the 
Frenchman would say. We were in
tently watching the four diHCs, occa
sionally noting the single disc first 
mentioned was going faster and faster, 
all at once the pressure in the boiler 
became so great that the darned thing 
blew up, sending a cap about four 
inches in diameter up to the ceiling 
and gee! it frightened us fellows like 
the mischief, not dreaming it was done 
intentionally, to show that if students 
bad-only this one ambition there could 
be but this one resulta final blowing 
up of the whole scheme.
Well, the demonstration was great, 
crude but efficient to the untutored 
mind, and we were told It was work
ing finely among the rural peoples of 
China.
Next afternoon, I had the pleasure to 
address the students of all. the foreign 
schoolBi. e., the young people of the 
foreigners settled in Shanghaia big 
crowd of themand, as the East China 
Educational Commission was having 
their annual convention, they adjourn
ed to attend the Lecture and many 
Chinamen were present. It was a 
big crowd and a most attentive one.
So you see, dear Arthur, though I 
came from home, expecting to escape 
from this sort of work for awhile, yet 
I have really done more of it than had 
f been at home. This, with dinners, 
luncheons, an occasional banquet and 
teas, gee! it's a wonder I am alive, 
indeed. I have been upset four times 
with food that I only tasted, but of 
late, finding that it is no offense to a 
Chinaman to refuse a dish, or even to 
get up and leave the table, I have 
drawn the line on sharks fins,' birds 
nest soup (slugs I havent dared' to 
touch), bamboo sprouts, duck skin, 
etc.
Well, we left China for good on the 
,15th, had a fine, smooth voyage from 
Hong Kong to Nagasaki, saw what is 
only to be seen one place in the world, 
i. e., at Nagasaki, a 30,000-ton steam
ship loaded with coal by 900 men and 
women (half women), who transmitted 
1,600 20-pound baskets of coal from the 
coal barges to the coal bunker sliutes 
of the ship per minute. Our basket
ball players are not in it.
We landed at Nagasaki for a day 
and a half and though we were sailing 
for Kobe, had to go through a rigorous 
examination by the doctorsJapanese. 
Then, as to our passports, in fact,, in 
tiie Chinese port cities, especially 
Hong Kong, which is under the con
trol of Great Britain, there is constant 
lookout for spies, and even our Amer
ican visitors and residents have to(go 
through a lot of annoying rod tape. 
Of course, under present conditions, 
I prcHume it is necessary, though one 
of our friends, a Mr. Finch, who lias 
been bore in Shanghai a year study
ing the geology of China In reference 
to Its mineral deposits, was arrested 
while wo 'wore In the city, 1. e., arrest
ed at Hong Kong, and had It not been 
for Ills throat to appeal to the Amer
ican authorities tills paper would 
have boon 'taken from him.
The only thing ho or our party could 
make out, they wanted to get hold of 
fcho Information ho had gained by Ills 
years research.
Well, here we are making a rapid 
run from Kobe to Osaka, the Pitts
burgh of Japan, then to Kyoto, where 
we are located in the most luxuriant, 
apartments we have seen, not even 
the Plaza in New York can touch 
them, as they were prepared for the 
Coronation, as here the present Em
peror was crowned a year ago.
The table I write on is a beautiful 
piece of enamel work which I should 
love to have in my room.
We rstay here until Sunday, as 
Swasey is recovering from a cold, and 
from here we go to Tokio, then Nilco, 
then Yoholiama, from where we sail, 
lyiarch 9, for Honolulu. This is cutting 
our stay in Japan one week, which we 
decided we would spend in Hawaii, as 
I am particularly anxious to see the 
volcanoes of Kilauea, the last chance 
I will get in my lifetime, and I have 
seen pretty nearly my share of Old 
Nature.
We expect to reach California on the 
2d of April, if alls well. Then a short 
stay with relatives, and then home
ward. Yes, for home, sweet home. I 
had to be vaccinated in Shanghai for 
safety, as the smallpox was epidemic 
in Hong Kong and Canton. I got the 
dose of the crowd, and while it was 
ten days before it took, for two 
solid weeks it went for me lively, and 
when I reached Canton I concluded 
some kind of infection had gotten into 
the wound, for my arm was swollen 
down to my wrist. Fortunately, when 
I got to Canton Christian College 1 
had the satisfaction of falling into the 
hands of a good doctor and a nurse, 
the wife of Prof. Laird, a brother of 
our good friend, Prof. Laird, of Phila
delphia, University of Pennsylvania. 
The good wife was from a family i 
know in McKeesport, and after the 
two had dressed the sore, they assured 
me it was simply an aggravated case 
and 1 might congratulate myself on 
it: taking so well, as, if I had taken 
smallpox, you would not have seen 
Uncle John again in this old round 
world.
Well, it was then, when I thought it 
might be all up with me, that I got a
good dose of homesickness, and every 
now and then I certainly long for a 
handshake with the Pittsburgh boys 
and girlsold and young.
Your telling me of the postponing 
of operations on further building does 
not surprise me, and it is interesting 
to correlate your position with all the 
educational interests of China, as at 
every one of the educational institu
tions we have visited they are post
poning all building operations, though 
a number of them have funds for 
buildings, but the rate of exchange in 
China is so high and varies from day 
to day, that one never knows where 
lie Is at.
For instance, when we were in 
Shanghai, we got on an average $157 
"Mexican dollars for 100 gold, where
as we should get $195; at Hong Kong 
we got $172, whereas we should have 
$195. So you see things are in bad 
shape over there, in fact, our consul 
generals and their attaches told us the 
cut was a very serious matter to them. 
Indeed, our Minister at Peking, Dr. 
Reinsch, told us the same.
Well, you will tire of reading this 
lengthy epistle, but Ive so much to 
tell you that even now I have only 
skimmed over the surface. With this 
I send my love to dear Mrs. Ilamerschlag ajid the boys, to all the dear 
folks, faculty and all at Tech, to Uncle 
Frank Nicola, to the dear fellows of 
the Commission, and you are always 
to count me as
Yours affectionaltely and faithfully, 
UNCLE JOHN.
CHEMICAL ENGINEERS 
INSPECT LANGELOTH
Last Thursday the Chemical En
gineers, under the direction of Dr. 
James, took a trip to Langeloth, 
Pa., where they spent a whole day in
specting the gigantic plant of the 
American Zinc and Chemical Com
pany. Every unit of the plant proved 
to be of universal interest and1 value, 
as the plant is an excellent example 
of the modern methods of large-scale 
chemical production. A memorable 
feature of the trip was the mid-day 
royal gastronomic reception accorded 
the chemists at the club house. At 
the very first sight of the meal spread 
before them, the Chemists immediate
ly forgot their grievances against the 
Beanery and the latter automatically 
sank into oblivion. The table service 
was super-fine and particularly at
tractive, and this probably accounts 
for the mysterious disappearance of 
two chemists during the afternoon. 
On the whole, the inspection visit was 
very instructive and enjoyable, in 
spite of the fact that an avalanche of 
cinders, smoke and fumes continually 
swept with.unrelenting effort through 
the moving group of Chemists.

NEW DESIGN CLUB .ROOM 
IS BEING PREPARED
For several weeks now a committee 
of the Design School, of which Nelson 
P. Rice is chairman, has been work
ing on a plan to provide a cmb loom 
for the men of Design School. A place 
has been obtained in the old modeling 
room in the basement of the school. 
Furnishings are to be provided by 
popular subscription and gifts. The 
school authorities, through the De
partment of Construction and Equip
ment, have contributed fifty dollars. 
The Sophomore Class has given twen
ty dollars. Every man in th school 
is expected to contribute at least 
twenty-five cents. Finally any surplus 
remaining from the costume dance to 
be given soon by the school will be 
divided equally between the boys and 
girls club rooms, the latter having 
been established for some time.
In this way the committee hopes to
obtain over four hundred, dollars for 
furnishings. The furniture itself will 
be of fumed oak. The wall decora
tions will be problems completed by 
men of the schoolproblems of 
Classes A, B. and C, and Plebe draw
ings. These decorations will give 
quite a distinctive air to this club 
room, so that the club room will not 
only fill a long-felt want, but wilL be 
distinctive and unique as well.
