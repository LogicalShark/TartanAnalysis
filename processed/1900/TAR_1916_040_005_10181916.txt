PLAID BACKFIELD INTACT
GTOve City did not have a very 
auspicious opening of their football 
reason Saturday. At no time in the 
game could they say that they had 
he advantage. In fact, they did not 
evon come close. 1 Although about 
equal in weight they lacked the speed 
and the clocklike regularity that 
Steifans men displayed.
The game was full of features. Long 
runs by Finlay, Kesner and Marshall, 
mixed with the wonderful plunges of. 
Salt" and Brunwasser, left the boys 
from Grove City totally bewildered. 
The effect of Marshall in his old posi
tion was more than could be expected. 
Re was all that was needed to polish 
up the grand old plaid back field.
Altdoerfer tore some ligaments in 
liis left elbow and had to be assisted 
from the field. This was the only 
serious injury during the entire game.
Kesner was the greatest bugbear 
to the visitors. First around one end, 
then the other, flanked by an inter
ference, such as Tech rooters had 
never seen before, the plaid quarter 
back ran up gains that soon counted 
lor touchdowns.
While Grove City had the ball, Tech 
threw them for losses totalling sixty 
yards. Their line was exceptionally 
-wfeak, although the players looked 
every bit as large and heavy as any 
of the Tech line men. It was chiefly

Altho Few Old Men Back 
This Year, the Team is in 
Shape to Put Up Hard 
Fight
At a meeting of the M. M. C. S. VanHellenic Society, on Monday, it was 
decided that the sororities should be 
allowed to die outthat is, that no 
new girls should be taken in. This 
means that the departure o the pres
ent junior class will also be tho de
parture of the sororities. This is on 
conditions that no new ones bo al
lowed to organize within five years.
The Pan-Hellenic Society consists 
of two representatives (a junior and 
a senior) from each of the six sorori
ties in the school and was formed in 
1912. Its purpose was tb govern rush
ing, to bring the sororities closer to
gether, and to control the actions of 
the members. In the beginning it con 
sisted of the Theta Sigma, Delta Delta, 
Psi Delta Gamma, and Alpha Psi Sor
orities. Later, after the joining of the 
Psi Delta Gamma and the Theta 
Lambda to form the Delta Theta, this 
sorority, with Alpha Delta and Alpha 
Sigma Pi, was admitted. Each soror
ity was working towards nationaliza
tion. Only the best nationals were 
allowed to be petitioned and the ad
ministration encouraged the girls In 
their efforts. Suddenly, the faculty 
took action and voted that no national 
chapters be admitted. Since this fact 
has become known, the girls have 
been considering abolishing all soror: 
ities.

A heavenly banquet is the topnotch scene in Ben Jonson's play "The

Department of Dramatic Arts of the 
School of Applied Design have been 
driving at like niggers for the past 
two weeks and which will have its

the familiar faces of the drama stu

dramatic orgle, such as has never yot 
been enacted on the creaky stage of

until an actor dressed up to look like i

in front of the stage (Elizabethan 
manner, you know) and with a wafture of the hand gives each and every 
god a stroke of infantile paralysis, 
so that they just naturally fall to

Garber Head Staff
MR. MCORKLE SPEAKS SANITATION EXPERT
Next Saturday , the Big Plaid Team 
will meet the Allegheny eleven, their 
old rivals, ot Meadville. Coach Ham
mett, ot Allegheny, has been drilling 
Tiis men in the aerial game and they 
will probably try their Btunt of last 
year in using the forward pass almost 
exclusively.
Nearly all of last year's regulars 
have graduated and this year's team 
will be a green one. In weight, hows ever, the Allegheny squad is nearly 
equal that of Tech. The regulars left 
over from 1915 are Hartbaugh, center; 
Captain Scannell, left end, and Askey, 
fullback. The old subs back are Fow
ler, who stands six feet two inches 
and weighs 175 pounds and is trying 
out tor left tackle; Tyley, 180 pounds, 
is out for left guard, and Coulson, tho 
aspirant for right tackle, weighs 180 
pounds. Drake, who will probably 
play quarterback, was on the scrub 
team last year. Miller, a 135-pounder, 
is another quarterback possibility. 
Baldwin, sub-halfback last year, is 
the best looking "possibility for back 
of the line this fall.

all mechanical engineering students 
of the senior, junior and sophomore 
day classes and those of the fifth, 
fourth and third-year night classes 
are urged to be present, Whether they 
are members or not.
Mr. Starker is a very able speaker 
and an expert in liis line and the C. 
M. E. S. have been very fortunate in 
securing such a man to address them, 
In his address he does not propose 
to speak on electricity, but on the ap

NEW NIGHT COURSE IN 
BUSINESS PSYCHOLOGY
Dr. Scott Teaches Applied 
Psychology to Salesmen 
and Business Managers
HEAVY REGISTRATION
Miss Anna M. Thomas, '15, is teach 
ing science at tho Southland Seminary, St. Petersburg, Fla.
A night, course, known as Business 
Psychology, has been started this 
year. This course was planned last 
spring and Is In operation the pres
ent school year.
The course consists of alternate lec
ture and discussion hours, the latter 
being oiien to all tho students. The 
object Is to apply tho latest and most 
practical developments in psychology 
to modern business practice. It has 
boon determined that personal effi
ciency of salesmen and advertising 
managers is greatly increased by tho 
application of psychology to their bus
iness methods. Prosent systems of 
selecting and promoting employees re 
quires a knowledge of psychology 
which, several years ago, was consid
ered unnecessary and impracticable. 
It Is for this reason that business men 
who desire to keep abreast with re
cent developments in their particular 
field, are availing themselves of this 
course in Business Psychology.
Dr. Walter Dill Scott, an eminent 
psychologist, is the instructor. Dr. 
Scott has offices in the Central Build
ing. There also is located the Bureau 
of Salesmanship Research, conducted 
by Pittsburgh business concerns.
The course in Business Psychology 
is not a part of this research work, 
but is maintained for the benefit of 
those business men who desire to in
crease their knowledge of the applica 
tion of psychology to modern business 
methods.
The new course was popular from 
the start. The registration has been 
so heavy that no more applications 
will be considered. The enrolled stu
dents are men of considerable busi
ness experience, particularly sales
men, advertising managers and sales 
managers. The subject of instruction 
is included in the fifth year night com
mercial engineering course. However, 
the course in Business Psychology is 
not part of any one school, but is con
sidered a supplementary course.
Tho Institute has again demonstatod Its intention to provide prac
tical instruction for engineers and 
business men. How far this course 
may develop is unknown, but the re
sults of its work will constantly at
tract the attention of big concerns to 
our instructional facilities.
The Class of 1917 Design, at their 
regular meeting last Tuesday after
noon, elected the following officers: 
President, E. H. Beckman; Vice 
President, M. W. Alley; Secretary, J.
F. De Young; Treasurer, C. A. Gaus; 
Senator, J. R. Kilburn.
A close race between George Curry 
and Merle Alley for Vice President 
was finally decided by a toss up after 
three ballots resulted in a tie.
Final elections from the different 
departments for Senate Representa
tives resulted in the election of Oliver 
Wilkins, Department of Architecture; 
C. F. Crooks, Department of Painting 
and Decoration; H. I. Brown, Depart
ment of Music.
nesday of every month during the 
school year. Prominent men in the 
engineering profession speak to the 
members at these meetings. Many of 
these men cannot be heard any other 
place and this means a big advantage 
to all members of the society. After 
the speaking, the meeting takes the I 
form of a get together social and in ! 
most cases "eats are served. This j 
carries out the purpose of the society.! 
which is (1) to promote interest in 
mechanical subjects and (2) to pro
vide a social entertainment for all 
members. At present the society has 
about sixty members.
The officers of the society are: 
President, Harry A. Madison; Secre
tary, James H. Davis, and Treasurer,

on the sheet.
As to the personnel of the staff: 
John A. Carotliers, Science '17, will 
be Editor-In-Chief; M. B. Garber, Jr., 
Design 18, Business Manager; Robert 
C. Orr, Design IS, Art Editor, and 
Jamos R. Arnold, Science IS, Manag
ing Editor. Closely allied with the 
staff, but not actively, is Brady MeSwigan, the former Art Editor. He 
will continue to turn out the big 
double-page cartoon and a couple of 
full-page drawings each issue, but 
owing to the fact that the Alma Mater 
has had the pleasure of his presence 
for more than a half decade, he feels 
it his duty to leave honorably with a 
diploma this year and so will turn the 
most of his efforts in that direction.
After the first issue competitions 
for the three departments of the staff 
will be in order. To become a mem
ber of the editorial staff the competi
tor must have liad ten columns of 
material to his credit. Accepted jokes 
will have double credit. In the busi
ness department, competitors will be 
judged on the amount of advertising 
contracted and number of subscrip
tions soldit is impossible to arbitrar
ily set any specific amount. It is 
hoped that there will be a large num
ber of men answer the call as candi
dates in these competitions. Leave

of emulating benjonsonesque wit. The

served, has been rebuilt to resemble 
the Elizabethan stage of long years 
ago. It juts out into the audience so 
that the actors when not taking up 
their ques can carry on a conversation 
with their friends in the stalls. The 
rigging of the stage is to consist of 
imported black velvet and the per

beauty enhanced by being encased in 
a beautiful amazement of Elizabethan

last year. From these officers, R. M. 
Conley has resigned as president. His 
resignation was accepted, and last 
Thursday R. IC. Merker, of the Indus
try School, was elected to fill the va
cancy. One of his co-workers may be 
quoted as saying, Our daily meetings 
are sure to succeed, for Merker is 
starting out with the right sort of 
enthusiasm. The other officers are
C. E. Rutherford, Secretary, and Linwood Corser, Treasurer.
From the extent of the plans 
formed, it is evident that Mr. Millers 
visit has borne fruit with the cabinet 
and members of the Y. M. C. A. Just 
how much they in turn may accom
plish with the student body as a whole 
remains to be seen. Their plans de
serve to succeed, particularly the plan 
for a daily meeting. This would, in a 
way, supply to Tech the chapel ex
ercises which are held by so many 
other schools, especially the denom
inational colleges. The man with a 
technical education is frequently crit
icised because he is narrow-minded, 
and in this very thing we find some 
basis for the criticism. Since it has 
not been possible for the school to 
hold a regular authorized chapel, the 
student should have planned before 
this something in the nature of chapel 
exercises, something to take them 
away from material affairs for a few 
minutes each day. Now that the plan 
has been begun, it is the duty and 
privilege of every Tech man to help 
It succeed.

GENERAL SECRETARY
AIDS Y. M. C. A. COUNCIL
(Continued from Page One.) 
bers heard Mr. Kirk, secretary of the 
University of Pittsburgh Y. M. C. A.; 
they completed the election of officers, 
and formed very definite plans for 
the coming year. Of these plans .the 
most ambitious is the formation of a 
Bible class in every fraternity and 
boarding club about school. Although 
the plan is a great one,, the members 
are not blinded by its size; they ap
preciate the extent and difficulty of 
the work, but see no reason why the 
thing which has been done at other 
collegesas Mr. Miller pointed out in 
his; addresswhich has accomplished 
so much good at other schools can 
not be done at Carnegie Tech. The 
actual carrying out of this work has 
been left largely in the hands' of Paul 
Warner, of the Science School, to 
whom much of the credit for last 
years formation of the Y. M. C. A. 
itself must be given. The second part 
of his work is to provide teachers for 
these classes,, once they are formed. 
Already four members of our faculties 
have agreed to help in that way as 
soon as they are needed; these in
clude Professor Doyle, English De
partment Science School; Mr. Fitz
gerald Commercial Department of 
Science; Mr. Hartman, Assistant to 
the Dean of Applied Industries, and 
Mr. Bisbee, Department of .Chemistry 
Industries School. Other teachers 
will be provided as occasion demands.
The second very ambitious thing 
which the Y. M. C. A. has planned and 
is already carrying out is to hold a 
short meeting of the organization 
itself every morning. This meeting is 
held in Room 104 Industries before 
school opens, and lasts but a few 
minutes. It will not inconvenience 
anyone to get up a few minutes earlier 
in the morning, and the good which 
attendance at these meetings will do 
is inestimable. The success of the 
meetings, of course, depends entirely 
upon the number present; it is the duty 
of every Tech man to be there, espe
cially those new men who wrant to 
become acquainted with as many of 
the upperclass men as possible. The 
meetings will be in charge of the offi'-rs who were elected.n* '* ' rdose) of

CROSS COUNTRY SQUAD 
LOOKS PROMISING
Final Tryouts Will be Held 
Over Regular Course Nov. 4
COMPETITION WILL BE KEEN
Tlie cross-country squad is fast 
rounding into shape and should be in 
excellent condition for the final try
outs which are to be held over the 
regular course on November 4tli.
The squad this year looks most 
promising and the chances for a good 
time seem very bright with such men 
as Andrews, Lawson,. Howe and De 
Young left from last years team. Be
sides these four, Dunseith and Benter, two old letter men, are back in 
school and should make a strong bid 
for the team again this year.
New Men Needed.
Despite the fact that so many old 
letter men are back and despite the 
fact that there are about twenty-five 
men out every evening, new men are 
needed, and needed very much.
It seems a shame that we should 
have men in school who look like 
varsity material, but who do not have 
enough spirit and pep to come out 
and give the best they have to Tech. 
But such is the case. Of the twentyiiye or thirty men out, eighteen of 
them are from Applied Science, about 
five from Design and three or four 
from Industries. Science is doing its 
share! Why cant Design and In
dustry?
Last year Industries won the inter
school meet and had many good men 
out, but what are they doing this 
year? A word to the wise is a warn 
ing.
Elect Captain Soon.
Last years team will gather to
gether probably the last of this week 
and elect a successor to Captain Wal
ker, who did not return to school this 
year.
Come out, men! Get in good condi
tion for the final tryouts on the fourth 
and make this years cross-country 
team the best ever.
TRAVELS 50,000 MILES 
IN FIFTEEN MONTHS
Mr. Dosey has received a letter from 
R. G. McConnell, Machine Construc
tion 09, who is now employed by the 
Union Switch and Signal Company. 
In his letter he says: Tell Dean Con
nelly that I have traveled fifty thou 
sand miles in the last fifteen months 
for the company, building machinery 
for munition plants. This work has 
brought me in contact with all sorts 
of men, from the apprentice boy in 
the foundry to the presidents, of such 
companies as Brown & Sharpe, and 
Pratt & Whitney. I have visited fifty 
large cities and thirteen states, also 
Canada. The experience that I gained 
at Tech in the Foundry Department 
has helped me a lot in the past year.
TWO ELECTIONS HELD 
WITHOUT RESULTS
Last week two Science elections 
were held without result, in one case 
because of a tie, and in the other be
cause of lack of a majority. The elec
tion for a member of the Student Ac
tivities Board from the Junior Class 
was held last Wednesday in General 
Lecture. Of the three candidatesGeorge W. Todd, L. T. Barry, and A. 
J, Hanksthe first two tied, and the 
last was but two votes behind the 
others. The tie will be voted off to
day in General Lecture. In the Sopho
more Class, the election for Thistle 
Representative was held under the 
preferential ballot system. Since no 
one of the four candidatesG. A. 
Brandin, R. K. Lee, P. H. Armor, and 
L. B. Guthriereceived a majority of 
the votes on either first, second, or 
third choice, that election must also 
be held again!
TECH TO SUPPLY BUREAU 
OF MINES WITH POWER
New Government Power 
House Not to be Built for 
One Year
Work will be started this week to 
install an above-ground pipe line to 
the new- Bureau of Mines Buildings 
from Machinery Hall, for the purpose 
of supplying them with steam from 
the Institute. The . power station as 
planned for the Bureau is considered 
inadequate for the power demands 
likely to be made upon it. The four 
boilers that have arrived from Wash
ington and have been lying in the hol
low by the B. & O. tracks for some 
time are not thought to have suffi
cient capacity, and the Bureau pre
ferred to delay the construction of the 
boiler house until more funds could 
be appropriated by Congress this win
ter for the necessary enlargments.
Pending the authorization of this 
increase, the Institute has been glad 
to offer the use of one of its boilers, 
giving 350 H. P., at the cost only of 
fuel and the necessary labor and ma 
terials. Tech will furnish power for 
upwards of a year until the new plant 
is constructed.

MECHANICALS HEAR DR RICE, SEC7 A. S. M. E.
Last Monday afternoon Dr. Rice, 
secretary of the American Society of 
Mechanical Engineers, delivered a lec
ture to the Junior and Senior Mechan
icals of the School of Applied Science. 
In his talk Dr. Rice, who is a grad
uate of M. I. T., 1890, and a classmate 
of Dr. G. E. Hall and Mr. DuPont, 
brought out the progress of engineer
ing during the past year. In develop
ing this subject he explained the or
ganization of the Auxiliary Corps of 
Engineers, the Naval Consulting 
Board, the National Research Council 
and the Engineering Research Found
ation. He dwelt considerably upon 
the importance and opportunity of 
the local branch of the Engineering 
society.

THETA XI DINNER DANCE.
On Saturday afternoon and evening, 
October 14th, the members and 
pledges of Theta Xi Fraternity enter
tained at a football dinner-dance. The 
fellows all took their ladies to tlie 
game to help cheer for dear old Car
negie, after which they assembled at 
the fraternity house for dinner. 
Thirty-four couples had assembled by 
the time dinner was called, besides a 
few old fellows who had just dropped 
in after the game. After the dinner 
things were cleared for dancing and 
from 8 until 12 all enjoyed a good 
live dance, accompanied by the music 
of a piano and drums.

the ensuing year.
The 'following men were elected to 
the respective offices:
President, Cronise Iv. Koontz; Vice 
President, Joseph L. Carroll; Secre
tary and Treasurer, Edward Trieskey.
The purpose of the Tech Mechanics 
Club is to boost the Machine Construc
tion courses, to boost Carnegie Insti
tute of Technology in general, and to 
establish a closer relation between tliQ 
students of the different schools. The 
membership of tho club is extended 
to any student of the School of Ap
plied Industries, Carnegie Institute of 
Technology, in tho upper class of the 
Machine Construction Course; also to 
students of tho Middle Class of the 
above School and course having suc
cessfully passed the first semester 
work of their middle year.

score indicates.
Brunwasser, who replaced Finlay, 
showed marvelous, ability in going 
through the line. Frequently he could 
be seen going down the field with the 
line. No! not through the lino.
The game, although a ploasant one 
to witness from the Skibos stand
point, was in no way exciting. Sev
eral times Grove City tried the for
ward pass but always to no avail. If 
the Tech griddors succeed in break

week as well as they did Saturday 
afternoon there can be no doubt con
cerning the outcome of tho game.

An Indefatigable worker, an inter
esting personality and a true artist 
might bo one description of William 
Pool, who lms come over seas from 
London to coach tho students of the 
Department of Dramatic Arts of the 
School of Applied Design in a classic 
production of Bon Jonsons "The 
Poetaster/' Mr. Pool is the only man 
In England who dared to revive this 
rare old play of Ben Jonsons and 
mako it entertaining to a/modern au
dience. For the ilrst time since Eliza
bethan days he revived the play last 
spring, giving it in the Apothecaries 
Hall, London. This building stands 
on the original site of the old Blackfriars Theater, whore a company of 
children ilrst played the play In 1601. 
Mr. Poel gave two performances and 
after looking over the field of dra
matic talent at Tech last June con
sented to come back this fall and do 
the play here. The performance v/hict 
the Tech students will give next Wed
nesday night will be the third time 
the play has been performed since 
Jonsons time and the first time ever 
in America.
By many years of experience and 
study in producing the plays of 
Shakespeare and Ills contemporaries 
in the manner for which they were 
written, namely, on a platform stage 
without scenery, in Elizabethan cos
tumes of the period and with a man
ner and method of speech and action 
peculiar to the Elizabethan stage, Mr. 
Pool has earned recognition in Eng
land and indeed in this country as 
tho greatest living authority on the 
acting of Elizabethan plays.
He became an actor in 187G and in 
1881 made a production of "Hamlet/ 
using no scenery and dressing his 
actors In Elizabethan costumes. This 
was the first time since the sixteenth 
century that one of Shakespeares 
pluyB had been played in the manner 
for which it had been written. From 
this performance grew the Elizabeth
an Stage Society, of which Mr. Pool 
Is founder and director. Tills society 
Is now housed in a theater of its own 
In London, patterned after tho old 
Fortune Theater of ShakoBpoares 
day.
lyir. Pool Is an aristocrat of tho most 
genuine sort. His people catno from 
Normandy and Bottled In Devonshire 
and Bristol. Ills most distinguished 
ancofltor was Cardinal lloglnald Polo, 
tho prime minister to Bloody Mary, 
who reigned for five strenuous years 
during tho nilddlo of tho sixteenth 
century. "Mr. Pools older brother, a 
clorgyman In tho Church of England, 
boars a striking ronomblanco to old 
prints of Cardinal Pool. Mr. Pools 
father, William Polo, was ono of IDngUmd's colobmtod engineers of tho lastcentury, a mombor of tho Royal Socloty, a lovor of music and writer of 
musical criticisms and an authority 
before "Cavendish on tho gamo of 
whist. In ordbl* that his fathers name 
might not bo confused with his own 
on theatrical programs, Mr. Poel, 
when ho took up tho actor's life, 
changed his name to Its original spell
ing of sevoral hundred years ago, 
"Poehl, but later removed the "li 
and this has been his name ever since.
Mr. Poel will remain in this country 
until December. Prior to then he will 
deliver some lectures on the Eliza
bethan stage in Chicago, Detroit, St. 
Louis and Philadelphia.

McEntarfer, 185-pounder, a guard, 
and Heckman, 180 pounds, center on 
the scrubs last year, would be better 
players if they had more ginger in 
them. Wessenborn, 185-pound subguard last fall, is going to defy every
one to keep him off the line, despite 
his lightness.
The Freshman Ciass'turned in some 
good material, green, but promising. 
Cook, a 170-pound youngster, looks 
good at fullback. Cunningham and 
Shriver are out for the right-half va
cancy. Then there is Apgard, who 
weighs ICO, trying out for left half*
Under the skilful hands of Coach 
Hammett this green material has be
come a unit. In the past years his 
system has turned out teams that 
have been second to none at the pass
ing game.
Those who were lucky enough to 
see last year's game will remember 
their clever pass work. The Plaid 
eleven was unable to break up this 
aerial raid/ but succeeded very well 
in making it ineffectual. Allegheny 
with their best team in years came 
down from Meadville with the firm in
tention of stepping on Carnegie Tech. 
But the scoreTech 41, Allegheny 7 
shows they did not. Next Saturday 
they will again try to humble us, al
though tho chances are very much in 
our favor in view of the fact that 
they have an inexperienced team.

The Thistle Board met last Thurs 
day afternoon for its regular bi-weekly 
business session. At that meeting 
Mr. M. A. Zeller was elected to the 
position of staff-photographer. This 
step assures the Thistle more than 
the usual number of good live snap
shots of school events.
The Art Editor, Mr. F. C. Crooks, 
of the Design School, has already 
some ten or twelve plates completed 
and they more than satisfied the board 
of Mr, Zellers ability and interest in 
tho work. The other students of 
tho Illustration Department are help
ing very much to got this work out 
on time and In first-class style.
in is roportod that there are some 
studonts who have already exprossod 
tlioir desire to act as sales agonts. 
Tho board fools that it Is still too soon 
to begin an active campaign, but If 
the students will hand their names to 
W. D. Green, Industry School; G. W. 
Todd, Science School; Miss Helen 
Sonn, M. M. C. S., or F. C. McConnell, 
Design School, they will be consid
ered when the agencies are awarded.
(Continued from,Page One.)
Third, to bring to the attention of 
public-spirited and influential people 
of Pittsburgh the talents and merits 
of our local people by means of exhi
bitions and social gatherings, the ob
ject of which will be the special 
consideration oil a particular compe
tition.
The competitor is to select the in
intersection of two streets or ave
nues in one of Pittsburgh's best res
idential districts. The drawings must 
specify tho particular intersection 
the design is intended to develop. In 
any case car lines are to bo provided 
for on both streets. The corners of 
the four lots adjoining are supposed 
to bo acquired by the city in order 
to allow for this improvement. As 
some of the intersections selected by 
some of the competitors may not be 
that of streets at right angles, the 
shape of the site produced by the 
streets and the acquired property is 
loft to the discretion of the designer. 
It may be a square, a rectangle, 
circle or an ellipse, but in any case 
tho sum of the major and minor axes 
must not exceed 500 feet. The com
petitor may Include in his design 
pylons, pergolas, colonades, arcades, 
shelter houses, terraces, monuments, 
ornamental lamp posts, drinking 
fountains, balustrade, benches, otc., 
as ho 5RR5 fit. The space may be 
treated as a small park or made 
wholly architectural in character. It 
is tho purpose of tho committee to 
give as much latitude as possible to 
tho competitor.
Tho drawings required are a plan 
showing the interesting streets and 
the land acquired at tho scale of 1-16 
Incli equals 1 foot.
An olovatlon or section at the 
same scale.
A detail of an important feature 
at a larger scale.
The drawings must be submitted 
on or before November 15th at 5 
p. m., and will be judged by three 
jurors to be selected by the commit
tee, at least one of the jurors to be 
an architect of international reputa
tion. /
This competition is open to all res
idents and regular students in any 
institution in Allegheny county. A 
large proportion of juniors and 
niors in the school of architecture at 
Tech have entered the contest.
The awards will be $250 first prize 
and several honorable mentions. 
School credit toward graduation will 
also be given the lucky competitors.
Mr. E. Raymond Bossange, dean 
of the School of Applied Design, is 
chairman of the Committee on Com
petitions as well as a director of the 
Beaux Arts Salon and may be con
sulted by prospective competitors for 
further information.
Following the precedent established 
last year, the Shadyside Presbyterian 
Church Is arranging for a "Tech 
Night" on Sunday evening, October 
22nd. There is to be a special musical 
programwith the assistance of the 
school orchestra, if they can be ob
tainedand a sermon especially for 
Tech students by the pastor, Dr. Kerr. 
Best of all, our friend "Uncle John 
Brashear will be present and make 
an addfess. Last year everyone who 
attended enjoyed the exercises of 
Tech night, but at that time Uncle 
John was unable to be present; con
sequently the service this year should 
be that much the more enjoyable. It 
is a treat to hear Uncle John at any 
time, but it is especially so when he 
is talking to his friends, the students 
of Carnegie Tech.
The churchthrough Mr. Harry S 
Calvert, chairman of the invitation 
committeehas issued a most cordial 
invitation to the school. A commit
tee of students has been formed to 
help with arrangements; this consists 
of Paul Warner, of Science, chairman: 
Rutherford, of Industries; Todd, of 
Design, and Misses Bergham, Smith.' 
and Kiefer, of Margaret Morrison. 
The committee has this word to pass 
on to the students from Mr. Calvert, 
I would be very much pleased to see 
you at Shadyside Church any time, 
and especially on Tech night. Shady
side, at the corner of Amberson and 
Westminster streets, is one of the 
churches near Tech, and wishes to af
ford every opportunity to the young 
Christian men and women of the 
school to keep alive the faith of our 
fathers." Further announcements of 
Tech Night will be posted about the 
campus, and if still more information 
is desired, it may be obtained from 
the committee.
The standing of a man is as often 
as not told by his footwearif he is 
careless of that, hes apt to be negli
gent of more important things. If 
you will buy your shoes here, you 
may be certain of looking all right, 
feeling all right and impressing others with the fact that you are all 
right Our Shoes are built by some 
of the most representative Shoe Manufacturers in the world.

GRADUATE STUDENT DOES 
ORIGINAL RESEARCH WORK
Keller, 14, Mechanical, is In
vestigating Stresses in Rol - 
ing-Mill Housings
Unknown to the majority of Tech 
studonts, an important investigation 
has been in progress for over a year 
in Machinery Hall, which is concerned 
with the stresses developed in rollingmill housings.
Mr. Keller went upon graduation 
Into the employ of the American Sheet 
and Tin Plate Company, and at night 
bogan to investigate why rolling-mill 
housings broke at points least expect
ed to fall. Two methods wore open, 
tho polarized light and rubber model 
methods. Because of inability to se
cure the necessary apparatus for the 
first method, the rubber model pro
cess was adopted. This method con
sists, essentially, of preparing an ex
act miniature of the housing in rub
ber, carefully ruling rectangles upon 
its surface, and measuring the exten
sions' of these rectangles under vari
ous loads. The stretch in any area 
measured is proportional to the stress 
in the same space, and hence the 
stresses, at any part of the model can 
be determined very accurately. Cor
rections are necessary because the 
properties of rubber differ from those 
of either cast-iron or steel, of which 
the housings are made.
Mr. Keller used the photographic 
method in his work. The model was 
first loaded and then a photograph 
taken of it. With a micrometer mi
croscope Mr. Keller then measured 
the stretches produced,. This process 
was repeated with varying loads until 
sufficient data was secured. Great 
difficulty was experienced in prepar
ing the surface of the model for rul
ing. Fire paint and similar materials 
proved ineffective, and success was 
finally had by scraping the surface 
with a sharp knife which made it 
slightly moist or adhesive and then 
dusting it with magnesia.
Mr. Keller has been working for up
wards of a year upon this matter, but 
expects to be finished by the new 
year. Mr. Koller states that the re
sults so far obtained throw much light 
ui)on the subject of stresses in such 
castings, but he prefers to await the 
completion of the work before an
nouncing his conclusions.
