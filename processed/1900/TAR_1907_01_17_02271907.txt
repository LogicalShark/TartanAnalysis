DIRECTOR HAMERSCHLAG HON
ORED.
On last Friday, February 22, our es
teemed Director was most signally 
honored by Lehigh University. A de
gree of D. Sc. was conferred upon him, 
the first of its kind to be given by the 
above college in forty years. This de
gree was conferred for meritorious 
work in furthering technical educa
tion, and was, as we all know, well 
earned. We all remember Dr. Brashears words when he recommended 
Mr. Hamerschlag to the founder of our 
schools, Is he enthusiastic? Why, he 
will work- himself to death! No 
words could better describe the en
ergy with which we are all familiar.
Prof. Klein, Professor of the Mechan
ical Department at Lehigh, made the 
presentation speech, in which he 
highly praised the ability of Mr. Ham
erschlag in coping with the work he 
has in hand.
The Director was impressed with 
the regaid in which C. T. S. is held 
by the faculty and the students qf 
Lehigh, both by the greetings of Pres
ident Drinker, and by the demonstra
tions of the students. That this feel
ing is reciprocated is evidenced by the 
words of the Director and by the senti
ments heard on all sides coming from 
both faculty and students of Tech. 
It is hoped that this kindly feeling be
tween the two institutions will con
tinue to grow, for Lehigh University 
has always held a most enviable rep
utation for the kind of men at its head 
and for the excellent type of students 
which come from there.
A large number of representative 
men from this district were present at 
(Continued on page 2.)
M. M. C. S. BUILDING NEARLY 
COMPLETE.
 The opening of the new Margaret 
Morrison Carnegie School for Women 
will mark the beginning of something 
entirely new and original in educa
tional institutions for women. The 
building, which will occupy the cen
tral position of the group of buildings 
to compare the school is nearing com
pletion, and it is assured that regular 
school work will begin there about the 
latter part of March. Equipment has 
has been ordered and is arriving daily 
for the various departments, and is of 
such character that there can be little 
doubt as to the policy of the courses, 
which is primarily to teach young 
women to earn a living.
The building is a large four-story 
edifice, of the same general type of 
architecture as the mens school. The 
basement will be given over to the 
laundry department, which will be 
equipped for teaching the machine and 
hand methods. There will be a steam 
washing machine, centrifugal extractor, 
starching machine, steam dryer, man
gle, soap mixer, set tubs, up-to-date 
ironing boards, electric and gas irons^ 
On the first will be the Faculty 
rooms, general and private offices, 
Biological, Physical and Chemical La
boratories, general lecture and class 
rooms, and a locker room which will 
contain a new type of locker that will 
have ample space for the reception 
of any hat, however large.
On the second floor is the large study 
hall, with reference library, the re
mainder of the space is given over to 
class rooms.
The west wing of the third floor will

THE THISTLE.
A canvass of schools is to be made 
this week for subscriptions to the secojfjjr-annual number of The Thistle. 
Tins is being done in order to get an 
idea as to the number of copies to be 
printed so that the contract for the 
printing can be let as soon as possible. 
It is to be hoped that the book will be 
out before the end of the winter term. 
The size of the book is 8x10r/; inches 
and will consist of about two hundred 
pages, not including advertising. It 
will contain the names and pictures 
of the faculty, lists of students, his
tories and pictures of the different 
classes, pictures of the various athletic 
teams and musical organizations. 
There will be a choice collection of 
grinds, also snap-shots and other mat
ters of general interest.

AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY 
HOLD MEETING.
On Thursday evening, February 21, 
the Pittsburg branch of the American 
Chemical Society held their meeting 
at the schools. The students were in
vited to attend, and their contingent 
was made up mostly of Chemical Jun
iors, who were well repaid for attend
ing, as the address was interesting 
and most instructive.
Mr. James A. Aupperle, chemist for
E. C. Atkins & Co., Indianapolis, Ind., 
made an address on the volumetric 
method for the estimation of carbon 
in iron and steel by the use of barium 
hydroxide. Mr. Aupperle is the inven
tor of this method, which is based on 
the following data:
FirstBarium hydroxide can be 
titrated with acids in the presence of 
barium carbonate, and no carbonic 
acid will be lost.
SecondCarbonic acid is indicated 
by phenol phthalein, and when any 
barium carbonatis dissolved by stand
ard acid during titi'ation, the fact will 
be shown by change of color.
ThirdBarium hydroxide can be 
titrated with acids without filtering off 
the barium carbonate, provided the 
acid is added to the mixture by means 
of a capillary tube attached to the 
burette, and extending to the bottom 
of the solution that is to be titrated. 
The reason for using the capillary 
tube is: If any carbon dioxide is lib
erated it will be reabsorbed by the 
barium hydroxide above it. Phenolphthalein is used as an indicator. A 
two-gram sample is taken and placed 
in a platinum boat which fits into the 
Aupperle crucible. The sample is 
surrounded by ^-inch of emery, and
the crucible is then heated to about 
850 C, and a stream of oxygen passed 
through it, thence into the barium 
hydroxide solution. For steel determi
nations 75 C. C. are used and for ii'on 
150 C. C. contained in two Meyer tubes, 
each containing 75 C. C.. The borings 
are heated from 8 to 15 minutes, ac
cording to the amount of carbon pres
ent. The oxide of iron remaining is 
fused into one globule, and the origi
nal shape should entirely disappear. 
The barium hydroxide and precipitated 
carbonate are poured into a beaker and 
and the Meyer tube washed out three 
times. Phenolphthalein is added and 
the standard acid run in until the pink 
color nas entirely disappeared and 
white barium carbonate is seen. Stan
dard barium hydroxide is slowly added 
until the original pink color reappears. 
The number of cubic centimeters of 
barium hydroxide used in titrating 
back is subtracted from the amount of 
acid used. The acid and the barium 
hydroxide solutions are standardized 
so that 1 C. C. acid is equal to 1 C. C. 
barium hydroxide. The acid is stand
ardized with iron or steel of known 
carbon contents.
Mr. Aupperle successfully deter
mined the carbon in three samples 
whose analysis he knew. In each case 
he came within .02% of the corx-ect 
value. Mr. Walters, of the Lincoln 
Foundry, then tendered  a sample 
whose carbon contents were unknown 
to Mr. Aupperle, for analysis. He 
found the carbon within .03% of its 
right value.
The chief points in favor of this 
method are: First, the time saved by 
its use, and second, the small amount 
of platinum necessary, as compared 
with the old method. A complete an
alysis can be made in twenty minutes, 
including the time for drilling. The 
old method requires three or four 
hours. A. W. G.

MECHANICALS MAKE A TRIP.
On last Wednesday afternoon, in
stead or the regular laboratory period, 
Prof. Trinks took the Inventors So
ciety for a visit to the gear works of 
the R. D. Nuttaller. The party en
tered the shop about 1.30 P. M., after 
first running the gauntlet of the sten
ographers in the office, at which ordeal 
nearly every one carried himself brave
ly. The party was first split up into 
about four sections, and each of the
latter was placed in the care of one 
of the officers of the company. The 
large machine shop where the large 
gear planers, shapers, and milling ma
chines are located was first visited. 
In this department the company manu
factures gears up to 30 feet in diam
eter, but the production of railway 
motor gears and pinions is the most 
prominent part of the work. The en
gine room, next in order, contains four 
Westinghouse gas engines direct con
nected to alternators of the same 
make. The current generated is sup
plied to different parts of the building 
for power and lighting purposes. How
ever, it is not sufficient for the present 
needs of the shop, and a new engine 
belted to a dynamo is being installed, 
the extra load being- carried by the 
County Light Co. temporarily.
The upper floors of the building con
tain the lighter machinery for the pro
duction of small gears, the pattern 
shop, pattern storage and the trolley 
department. Considerable interest 
was shown by some of the students 
in the cutting of some special gears for 
automobiles out of high carbon steel, 
and also in a patented automobile 
transmission which the company is re
pairing. Several new types of trol
leys are being made, among which may 
be mentioned the compressed air trol
ley, and the new sliding shoe trolley 
for use in high tension electric railway 
work.
Everything is paid for by the com
pany on the piece work system, which 
was explained to the students by those 
in charge, and which seemed to have 
a hustling effect on the men in the 
shop. After the trip had been com
pleted many expressions were heard 
of the instruction which had been ob
tained, and all concerned hoped for a 
similar experience in the near future. 
---------o---------
PROGRESS OF THE THISTLE.
Editor Wallace, of the Thistle, re
ports that we can expect to get the 
Thistle for 1907 about March 25. The 
contents will be a little different from 
last year, it being the intention of the 
board to cut out the literary depart
ment of the paper. The grinds are 
not coming in so fast that they can 
not be counted, and the grind editor 
wishes the students would grind a 
little faster. The book will be about 
the same size and the price will be 
the same as that of last year.

THE CONCERT.
An informal concert will be given 
by the C. T. S. Glee and Mandolin 
Clubs in the new Machinery Hall, on 
Friday, March 15, 1907, at nine oclock. 
The entire proceeds will go towards 
placing the athletic association on a 
firmer financial basis. The present 
unstable condition of finances requires 
that the students do all in their power 
to make the affair a success. Unless 
this is done athletics will be seriously 
handicapped and perhaps end disas
trously to the plans of the various 
teams. The pride of a ticket is 25 
cents, consequently admission is with
in reach of all. Some students will 
find it inconvenient to be there on 
Friday evening. They would be ex
hibiting the true spirit by a little spec
ulation in this direction regardless of 
their being there, or not. A splendid 
program is assured. So bring your 
friends and do all you can to make 
athletics a success at our school. The 
situation is in your hands. So it is up 
to the students of Carnegie Technical 
Schools.

The Art of Handling Men.
We learn from the Worlds Work 
that it is the experience of those who 
have made it a careful study that it 
is not a wise policy for the executive 
head of a business to do much, if any, 
detail work. He may thinkand it 
may be sothat no one else can do 
the work as well as he, but he should 
be able to judge whether his subordi
nates are doing the right kind of 
work, and their reports to him should 
show to his trained mind whether the 
work has been properly performed.
He should see that they give details 
in their reports so concisely and cor
rectly that they can easily be digested 
when they reach him.
The executive head should have the 
salesmen, the bookkeepers, the ship
ping clerks, and all of the working 
force, report to the heads of their 
several departments, and the execu
tive head should require such heads
7iV g& H57 4OiB7lc7 d71
to in turn condense the reports into 
intelligible statements for him.
The executive head, by being sys
tematic, will soon have a most satis
factory system at work, the success 
of which will mean his own success.
If the executive of an institution 
recognizes and encourages the heads 
of the various departments, they will 
in turn encourage those under them, 
and all the machinery of the insti
tution will run smoothly. Encourj 
agement should be given all along the 
line, and all suggestions, no matter by 
whom made, should be listened to, 
for very often good suggestions are 
made by even the most lowely em
ployes.
Above all other things, however, the 
chief executive should bring into regu
lar conference heads of departments, 
officers and factory committees and 
secure their ideas.
Regular conferences with the vari
ous salesmen should also be part of 
the system.
By so doing the chief executive will 
have the benefit of the points of view 
of the men intimately in touch with 
the work that he is superintending. 
Even their enquiries and objections 
may be of value.
Another point in the management 
of subordinate heads of departments, 
is to provide everyone with an under
study.------o-------
. W. U. P. PROM.
The Junior class of Tech is in receipt 
of an invitation to attend the Prom, to 
be given by the Junior class of the 
University of Western Pennsylvania, 
at the Hotel Schenley, Friday evening, 
March 1. All those wishing to attend 
may receive further information upon 
applying to the Junior President 
(Tech).
The above invitation goes to show 
that our cousins across the river feel 
most kindly towards us, and we can 
most heartily say that the best of feel
ing exists among Tech men towards 
W. U. P. students.

Superheated Steam Tests at Purdue.
The Carnegie Institution of Wash
ington, D. C., has made a grant of 
$3,000 a year for a period of four years 
to Dean W. F. M. Goss of Purdue Uni
versity, Lafayette, Ind., for the pur
pose of determining the value of su
perheated steam in locomotive service: 
First, in connection with single expan
sion engines; and second, m connec
tion with compound engines. This is 
the second grant which the institution 
has made to Dean Goss. While given 
to him personally, its effect will be to 
stimulate and to make more effective 
the work of the Purdue Locomotive 
Laboratory. Funds thus received will 
be employed in supplementing the re
sources of the laboratory as derived 
from all other sources.

they mean when they yell, Question?
It is a technical term covering a 
certain common fundamental point in 
parliamentary procedure.

A large number of 1911 men seem 
to be on the water wagon, by the way 
they poured cold water on any sug
gestion made by the class.
Mr. S. S. Baker, of the class of 1910, 
has been compelled to return to his 
home in Jamestown, N. Y., owing to a 
severe illness contracted through over
work. Mr. Bakers many friends and 
classmates wish him a speedy and 
permanent recovery. The latest re
ports of his condition show that he is
improving steadily and may soon be 
with us again.
Prof.I dont.quite see your point.
Glasser, A-lNeither do I.
Lonergan (to Foster)Really, I 
wont hurt you. Come here one min

Apprentices.
The apprentices held a class meet
ing on February 20th and the follow
ing men were elected: J. J. Gallagher, 
president; T. A. Tooney, vice presi
dent; M. E. Joyce, secretary; E. G. 
Hoffman, treasurer; J. T. White, 
artist.
H. H. Krauss received a rousing re
ception from the Trade courses, when 
he was elected class historian. Some 
great men from our Master Mechanic.
One of the most interesting events 
likely to take place in Birmingham 
during the present year will be the 
formal opening of the new university 
at Bournbrook, the building of which 
was due to the initiative of Mr. Joseph 
Chamberlain. This is a matter of 
some moment to the iron trade, be
cause a vei:y large part of the new 
institution is devoted to metallurgy, 
and the metallurgical department gen
erally cannot be rivaled, or even ap
proached in this country. There is a 
very well equipped steel smelting 
laboartory, equipped with a Siemens 
regenerative furnace, with casting pit 
and lift complete, and there is a blast 
furnace and a foundry for experi
mental steel and brass work. Prac
tically the whole equipment is entire
ly up-to-date, and Prof. Turner, under 
whose supervision the scheme has 
been developed, has succeeded in in
corporating the very latest ideas. The 
department will attract students from 
all parts of the kingdom, and is like
ly to have, when in full operation, a 
world-wide fame.

THE PHILHARMONIC LITERARY 
SOCIETY.
At the regular meeting of the So
ciety held in their room last Thursday 
the debate: Resolved, That the wage 
earners are benefited by a protective 
tariff, resulted in an animated and 
thorough discussion of the subject in 
all its phases.
Messrs. Israeli and Potts put forth a 
line of argument that would have done 
credit to the most able advocate of 
Dinglyism, Messrs. Exline and Cohen, 
however, proved the fallacy of some 
of the arguments presented by the af
firmative side and defended their posi
tion in such an able manner that the 
judges declared in their favor.
Owing to the lateness of the hour 
and the thoroughness of the debaters 
in handling the question, there was 
no general discussion after the debate.

NOTES.
The intimate relation that exists be
tween the Faculty and student body 
of the Carnegie Technical Schools has 
few if any counterparts. The demo
cratic, ever ready to help spirit of the 
professors and instructors is appre
ciated by all, and more fully perhaps 
by those who have been subjected to 
the old-style, straight-laced system, 
under which the professor is looked 
upon as a Deity by the students. The 
advantages which a scholar derives 
from close relationship to his instruct
ors are inestimable, and the folly of 
the Kow Tow system can not fail 
to be evident to any who have sampled 
it. There are a few men in school, 
however, who require that old-style 
method previously spoken of, as a pre
liminary training. They would then 
doubtless learn the importance of 
showing the Faculty members the 
proper amount of respect. It would 
be possible to realize then, that even 
though a pfofessor or instructor has 
given them individual instruction, and 
incidentally told a ' good story that 
there would be no provocation to ad
dress this teacher with: Say, Capt., 
or call him simply by his last name.
The intimacy that exists is a good 
thing; but we should never let famil
iarity exclude respect.
Mr. Pfouts purchased a can of to
bacco during the week. A notable 
event.
Negotiations are going on relative

often. We will be well satisfied.
The coffee and sandwich committee 
has the Transport in running order, or
