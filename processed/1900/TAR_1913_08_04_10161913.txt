Dr. Esquerre, the new head of the 
Department of Student Health, spoke 
on the system to be followed by the 
department and what is expected from 
the student body in the way of co
operation. He said that the depart
ment was naturally interested in the 
health of the athletes, but still more 
interested in the health of the student 
body as a whole, and it was to the 
latter that the department was to de
vote its efforts. In order to do this 
successfully they must (establish a 
bond of good fellowship between the 
students and the health authorities, 
and that was to be done by more per
sonal methods than had been used 
before; and he, Dr. Esquerre, would 
get the name and address of every stu
dent whose home was not in Pitts
burgh, and call on him as often as the 
number of students and the seven days 
a week would permit.
The students part in the plan is 
given below:
First, an absence due to sickness 
should be telephoned in to the school 
before 9:30 A. M. to Miss Conners, 
at which time a list of ill students will 
be made up and sent to the school 
physicians.
Second, a classmate of an absent 
student should drop the name and ad
dress of the absent one in a box be
fore 9:30 A. M. These boxes will be 
placed in the main halls of the three 
buildings.
If this is done, a physician will be 
able to attend to the students wrants 
immediately, and thus avoid any 
dangerous delays, which might lead to 
fatalities as has happened in the past.
Dr. Marks then said that Dr. Es
querre had spoken of what was ex
pected of the students, and that he 
would speak on the students privi
leges. The schools have a board of 
specialists, and in a case for which 
he does not have the facilities for 
treatment, the student will be sent 
to the best specialists in Pittsburgh. 
Trouble can be avoided by reporting 
any ailment immediately to the school 
physicians.
Doc then spoke of the number of 
fellows who neglect their bodies for 
the benefit of their brains, and whose 
sole activities are confined to their 
books, thus narrowing their minds

WAINSBURG WALLOPED 180
MUDDY FIELD SAVES THEM WORSE BEATIM
In a drizzling rain and on a muddy 
field, the Varsity opened their home 
season last Saturday by sending 
Waynesburg down to defeat by the 
score of 18 to 0. How large the score 
would have been under more favor
able conditions, is impossible to say, 
for at least one touchdown was spoil
ed by a slippery ball. Carnegie played 
all around the visitors in all depart
ments. The line held better, the ends 
were faster and got away under punts 
in better form', and the backs showed 
greater speed, hit the line harder and 
picked the holes to more advantage 
than the players of the Blue and Gold.
The team made a very favorable 
impression on the few student spec
tators that attended the game. That 
these were so scarce is a disgrace 
to the schools. In spite of the rain, 
the attendance of outsiders was good, 
but only a few undergraduates were 
in the stand, and most of these might 
as well have been absent, for all the 
encouragement that was given the 
team. The cheering was weak and 
lacked snap and unison. The band 
was practically all that saved the rep
utation of the students for loyalty.
No special stars for the day can be 
picked out, unless Balsinger and McCaughey shone a little brighter than 
the others. The former played a re
markable game, pulling off long runs 
that seldom failed to make first down. 
McCaughey gave an exhibition that 
places him in line for the choice as 
the best full-back that we have had 
for a number of years. His gains were 
on line bucks, and he went through

the Waynesburg primary defense 
much as a circus equestrian goes 
through a paper I hoop. Kreider 
worked at quarterback, running the 
team well, and, when carrying the ball 
showing phenomenal speed. He 
scored the first touchdowns on 25- 
yard and 35-yard runs respectively. 
Markley, a former Ohio State player, 
made his first appearance in a Car
negie game, and fitted in well with 
the other back field stars. Parke was 
sent in at the beginning of the last 
period, and earned his right to the 
place during the entire quarter. The 
most commendable feature of the 
back-field play was the interference 
which wras formed for the man carry
ing the ball.
The line played like an aggregation 
of Thanksgiving Day veterans. On 
offense they opened wide holes in the 
Waynesburg line, and on defense held 
as solidly as a stone wall. Capt. Clair, 
Trautman and Fulmer took their 
places without the advantage of scrim
mage practice of the last week, hav
ing been kept out because of injuries. 
The way that they threw themselves 
into every play seemed to indicate 
that no such practice was needed. 
Each one in turn pulled off some play 
that meant the loss of the game for 
the visitors. Clair was handicapped 
in his kicking by a badly swollen 
ankle, which was the cause of miss
ing the three goals from touchdowns.
Burke played like a fiend, and, with 
his speed and fierce tackling, threw 
the Waynesburg runners for losses

Here, at the end of ten years, I 
am prepared to say to you that we 
have reached the successful culmina
tion of our experiment. Thus spoke 
Director Hamerschlag in speaking of 
the growth of the night schools at 
the mass meeting of the Night Science 
men, Room 209, in the Applied Sci
ence building, Friday evening at 8:30.
The director opened his talk with 
a statement of night school condi
tions ten years ago. Then on account 
of a variety of causes such as ten-tothirteen hour days, sveen day work, 
the lack of spare time among the 
working class, and poor transit ac
commodations, there were no night 
schools of the type Carnegie exempli
fies.
I know of a dozen universities, 
some of them in Europe, which spend 
more to keep alive night education 
than day, continued the director. 
This new idea, to furnish a long con
structive night education with the 
best of teachers and equipment, origi
nated with this institution, the pioneer 
of thorough night education in the 
United States. Not only the previous 
mentioned universities but the Uni
versity of Pittsburgh, the Pennsyl
vania College for Women, the numer
ous night high and grammar schools, 
at first only ridiculing and discourag
ing, have now become Carnegies im
itators.
The future important branch of the 
night science work, according to the 
speaker, will be the graduate courses 
offered to engineering graduates, who 
can, in the atmosphere and equipment 
of a good technical school, carry out 
the research wTork of the future.
If we can do anything to stimulate 
your imagination, count it of more 
value than any series of formulae we 
can give you. The rewards paid to 
young men today are simply unbe
lievable. In my limited sphere, there 
has been brough to my attention in 
the last two months the names of six 
young men called to $50,000 salaries, 
not all engineers, but most of pro
fessional training. They have been 
called because they have inherent 
leadership; because they have imagin
ation.
I am going to ask you to do these 
three things tonight simply as an ap
peal to your reason: first, try to do a 
little more than your teachers lay

Fortunately for our students, col 
lege life, in the popular acceptance 
of the term, is noted for its absence 
at Carnegie. There be many who 
think that the life of a young man 
in college is one continuous round of 
pleasure. According to press notices 
and popular college stories, his daily 
occupation consists in playing cards, 
attending the theaters, drinking, etc., 
etc. Likewise his nightly life. Books 
are used merely as dust-catchers, and 
are kept in concealed corners, where 
no one will be tempted to open them, 
much less study them.
Of course, this view of American 
colleges is utterly wrong, but that it 
exists cannot be denied by any ob
servant person; and it is this which 
causes all the agitation against col
leges and especially against those 
schools where fraternity life is welldeveloped. There are, possibly, a 
select few in some of our famous 
universities who do their best to have 
what they call a good time, and in
cidentally to get awTay with all the 
paternal income they can lay their 
hands on; but the majority of Ameri
can college men must not be judged 
by the scant minority.
Especially is this true of Carnegie 
students. Here the men are all hard
working and industrious; they come 
to school with a well-defined purpose 
to learn, and in the main, they ac
complish that purpose. There are of 
course some who are mentally more 
proficient than others, and these find 
the courses a little easier; but all 
are here with the intention to work. 
They do not have any time to waste 
on idle amusements; in fact, they 
would not have enough time for a 
good nights rest if they did all that 
was expected of them.
Let us take an example of one class 
in the Engineering School. This class 
has a weekly schedule of 15 recitation 
hours, and 17 laboratory hours. It 
is a rule of the faculty that a stu
dent ought to spend at least two hours 
of outside work to each hour of reci
tation. This maktes 30 hours per 
week of outside work; and, suppos
ing that the student is not expected 
to study on Sunday, means that 5 
hours each night must be spent in 
studyto say nothing of the large 
amount of time required to write up 
reports on laboratory work, which in 
the experience of many has been found 
to consume as much time as that 
spent in study. In other words, the 
student may start in at 7 or 7:30 in 
the evening, and reasonably expect 
to finish at midnight or a little later 
this every night in the week.
Of course, this is not done by the 
students at Carnegie; it just shows 
what they would have to do in order 
to get the very best out of their col
lege course. But though they do not, 
and cannot, meet the expectation of 
the faculty, it is nevertheless true 
that the students here are more than 
industrious, and dserve all the credit 
they get for what they accomplish.
Then, is it not wrong to suppose 
that the life of the college man is an 
easy one? Certainly, there are a great 
many easier occupations in this world 
than to spend the entire day in school 
and the entire night in study. We 
hold, therefore, that the students at 
Carnegie are not representatives of 
a worthless counterfeit college aris
tocracy; they are democratic men in 
every sense; some day they will be 
numbered among the leading citizens 
of this country, and their hard work 
now will but fit them the better for 
the sterner realities and difficulties 
of mature life.

On Friday afternoon, October 10, a 
general mass meeting was called for 
the purpose of practicing cheers under 
the new cheer leader, Savage, before 
the Waynesburg game. This meeting 
was called for five oclock so that 
classes would not interfere with any
one attending the meeting.
The turnout for this meeting was 
decidedly poor. The Plebes as well 
as the Upper Classmen were conspic
uous b ytheir absence. This shows 
a decidedly poor spirit throughout the 
school, for it was the first time that 
cheers have been practiced this year. 
The Plebes need this practice and as 
for the Upper Classmen, well it would 
not have done them any harm either. 
The few who did turn out for the 
cheering can be congratulated for the 
noise that was made, as it was much 
better than the cheering in the game 
on Saturday.
The cheering during Saturdays 
game was good when the men fol
lowed the leader. But when several 
in the crowd tried to lead it from the 
stands, the yell was seldom carried 
through to the end. If any sort of an 
impression is to be made upon the 
crowds at the Geneva game next Sat
urday, a great deal of practice will 
have to be done in the meantime. For 
if the yelling at that game is not a 
decided improvement over that of last 
Saturday, the section will be hooted, 
and one of the purposes of the trip to 
Geneva will be defeated.

Several noted men have been se
cured to speak to the students in the 
near future. Among them are the 
rival candidates for the office of 
Mayor of Pittsburgh, and Dr. William 
Stephens Rainsford.
On Monday, October 20th, Dr. 
Rainsford speaks at the Carnegie 
Music Hall, and on the following day 
will lecture to the students of the 
Applied Science, Design and Indus
tries at noon in the Science Building. 
Later in the day he will lecture to the 
students of the M. M. C. S.
The subjects for his lectures are 
The Poison Makers of Africa, illus
trated with many sildes, and The 
Last Colonization of England.

They tell us that another year will 
witness the passing of the Beanery. 
Cheering news; but oh, the many 
dyspeptics who have been graduated 
from Carnegie.
We all have colds following the 
wet feet from last Saturdays game. 
But it was worth the price.
Our new football trainer once 
trained Fitzsimmons. That means 
that the team this year is going to 
be a fighting one, and opposing teams 
should mind their step.

Owing to the good weather last 
week, the first round of the tennis 
tournament progressed on schedule 
time, while several matches of the 
second round were also decided. Be
cause of the large number of matches, 
it was impossible to judge the indi
vidual play. It is too bad that so 
many contests were defaulted. The 
tournament is held primarily to dis
cover material for the tennis team, 
but this is impossible if the players 
advance without earning their places. 
The following were the winners: 
First round, Douthett, Pickering, 
Baume, Wilson, Vierheller, Schuchman, Kelcey, Wildberg, McMillan, 
English, Murphy, French Sontum, 
Stevenson, Bihlman, Savage. Second 
roundBaume defeated W. Wilson,
8-6, 6-4; English defeated McMillan, 
6-3, 2-6, 6-3; French won from Mur

As every one knows, one of the 
most important factors of any ath
letic team is its trainer. Well, we 
have that factor. A man who could 
hold down that job with the Brook
lyn National Base Ball team would 
certainly be a valuable addition to 
Tech. When the Brooklyn team fin
ished its last game on October 6th, 
Frank Kelley, their trainer, packed 
his trunk and moved to Tech with 
all his dope to keep our athletes in 
fighting trim. Kelly comes to us with 
quite a record. He has trained sev
eral prize fighters, chief among whom 
is the great and only Bob Fitzsim
mons. It was through Mr. Walker, 
Techs one big booster in the Big 
League, that we got Kelly. Mr. Wal
ker, it will be remembered, helped 
coach our team last year. Besides 
being a good trainer he has a huge 
collection of good stories and can en
tertain audiences for hours at a time. 
He has found a big warm spot in 
every mans heart here at Tech and 
with his good work we are sure of 
winning all of our games. He will 
be with us till February, when he 
leaves for the south to join the Brook
lyn team again.

Director Hamerschlag opened his 
talk to the Night Industries classes 
of this year by cordially welcoming 
them at their mass meeting, Room 
104 Applied Industries Building, at 
9:30 Friday evening.
After speaking of the development 
of the night schools in their first eight 
years up to the present, the director 
explained the three functions of the 
Industrial school: First, to prepare
men for industrial foremen; second, 
to train teachers of manual art and 
shop practice for colleges, high 
schools and grammar grades; third, 
to prepare for a later engineering or 
art course.
There never was a day in the 
United States when, in the field of 
industries, pay was so high for brains 
and skill mixed. In the number of 
positions paying $10,000 a year, Pitts
burgh is second to New York alone. 
The whole city of Pittsburgh from 
here to the Point is going to be re
built for the taxes are too high for 
the kind of buildings.
The director was speaking of the 
great opportunity for technically 
trained industrial men, architects, and 
engineers in this locality. I predict 
there will be not an inch of room by 
November, the first, prophesied the 
speaker, after requesting that all stu
dents and alumnae advertise the 
schools in order that their numbers 
might prove an inspiration to the best 
teachers to come here.
The announcement of the football 
game on Saturday was at the close 
of his lecture. He phrased his request 
for the presence of all possible night 
men as follows:
I want you to be there to see 
your fellow students striving with all 
their might for this institution, and I 
want you to be there to show hospital
ity to the other team.
Dean Connelly immediately after 
the lecture read a message from1 the 
Board of Governors of the Applied 
Industries Alumnae Association in 
which their readiness to help students 
at any time was expressed. A smoker 
to which all Industries night men are 
invited, the dean next announced. 
This was to be held by the Alumnae 
Association the next Monday night, 
October 11th at 9:00 P. M. in Room 
104, A. I. building. After the deans 
request that all classes organize as 
soon as possible, a photograph of the 
students ended the meeting.

selves in the School of Applied Sci

either has it or he hasnt it. And the 
forming of a strong bond of good fel

this aquality; third, be the schools

With the announcement of the foot
ball game the next day and the re
quest that as many night men as pos
sible go to see their fellow students 
play, Dr. Hamerschlag concluded his 
initial lecture to the Night Science 
classes of 1913-14.
Immediately after the lecture, Holzworth, chairman of the club room 
committee, spoke of the condition of 
the room, the new fund appropriated 
for it, and the trophy case to be placed 
there. He requested that as early as 
possible the night men elect two rep
resentatives to the club room commit
tee.
Lloyd, and Miss Wilson were in the 
receiving line.
Entertainment was furnished in the 
form of vocal solos by Mr. Esquerre, 
Miss Bromley and Miss Sawyer. Miss 
Pond gave a very entertaining imita
tion of a little boy telling a story.
The committee in charge were Miss 
Nickerson, chairman of the Faculty 
committee on entertainments. Miss 
Lloyd, president of the Senior class, 
Miss Horigan, chairman of the Re

repeatedly. Lauer, Hellstrom, Welch 
and Tyler fitted into their places well 
and held tTieir opponents helpless 
when the latter were most desperate. 
Wilson went into the game late, but 
acquitted himself well.
The game was started at 2:40 
oclock, Sayres kicking off to Clair, 
who returned 15 yards to Techs 35 
line. Balsinger and McCaughey made 
first dowm on three tries at end, then 
Balsinger pulled off a brilliant end 
run behind perfect interference for 15 
yards. Tech again made first down, 
following which McCaughey attempt
ed a forward pass, which Spinning 
caught, going out of bounds on 
Waynesburgs 30-yard line. Spinning 
and Dinsmore made a scant four 
yards before the latter fumbled, Clair 
recovering on the 35-yard mark. Mc
Caughey gained 4 yards and Balsinger 
ran the ball forward 10 more. Markley went through the line for a total 
of four yards in two attempts. A 
forward pass, McCaughey to Kreider, 
put the ball six yards from the goal 
line. Big Mac carried the ball over 
but it shot from his arms as he cross
ed the line, and Sayres recovered, be
ing downed back of the goal.
The ball was given to Waynesburg 
on their 20-yard line, but Tech held 
against their attacks, and Sayres was 
forced to punt. Balsinger fumbled the 
kick, but recovered on Techs 40 line. 
He followed with an end run of 20 
yards, and was forced out of bounds 
on a second one on Waynesburgh 25 
mark. Kreider took the ball through 
for the first touchdown. Clair missed 
goal. Score: 6-0.
Sayres kicked off, and Waynesburg 
held the Plaid players for no gain, 
forcing McCaughey to punt. The 
quarter ended with the ball on 
Waynesburgs 35-yard line. Score: 
6-0.
tncfgi Qreobno.
Waynesburg gained 6 yards on 
three tries, then kicked. The ball 
was called back and Waynesburg was 
penalized 15 yards for holding. Sayres 
again punted, and the ball went out 
of bounds on Waynesburgs 35-yard 
line. Kreider got away for another 
sensational run, scoring the second 
touchdown. Clair missed the goal. 
Score: 12-0.
The remainder of the period was 
marked by short gains and fumbles, 
the ball staying near the middle of 
the field. Kreider made the only long 
run, gaining 12 yards in two plays 
before the half ended.
Tvioi Qreobno.
Dinsmore kicked off to Clair, who 
ran back 20 yard sto his 45 mark. 
Balsinger gained 1 yard and Mc
Caughey was tackled by Ely for a 5- 
yard loss. Tech was penalized 15 
yards for holding, and McCaughey 
punted. From their 45-yard line, 
Waynesburg advanced only 4 yards 
in three downs, one being an unsuc
cessful forward pass. Dinsmore 
kicked to Balsinger on Techs 30 
mark, and Carnegie failing to gain, 
McCaughey punted to Hill. A fumble 
cost Waynesburg 5 yards, placing the
ball on their 30 line, from where they 
kicked. Balsinger caught the ball and 
went out of bounds on Techs 40-yard 
line. After two short gains, Mc
Caughey punted to Dinsmore, who 
was downed by Lauer on his 15-yard 
line. Waynesburg again failed to make 
first down and punted. Kreider stop
ped with the ball on the visitors 45- 
yard line. Waynesburg drew a pen
alty of 5 yards for off-side play. Bal
singer ran 18 yards and 10 yards on 
two successive scrims before the quar
ter ended. Score: 12-0.
Fourth Quarter.
Waynesburg sent in three fresh men 
and Parke replaced Markley for Tech. 
With the ball in Techs possession on 
their opponents 10-yard line, Mc
Caughey hit the line like a ball out 
of a cannon and shot clear of the mixup for the third touchdown. Clairs 
invalid ankle refused to work and the 
goal was missed. Score: 18-0.
Hill kicked off to Parke, who ran 
25 yards before being downed on 
Waynesburgs 48 mark. Balsinger and 
McCaughey, between them, gained 16 
units. Parke failed to gain, but a for
ward pass, Kreider to Burke, put the 
ball 17 yards from the goal. On the 
next play, the referee ruled that 
Burke was playing too rough and sent 
him out penalizing Tech 42 yards. 
McCaughey booted to Waynesburgs
20 line. Hill and Dinsmore gained 10 
yards, then Hill failed to advance 
three times. Hill punted to Kreider 
on Techs 43 mark, and Parke and 
Mac gained 17 units on three runs. 
A forward pass failed and Waynes
burg was set back 5 yards. Balsinger 
ran 12 yards and Mac put the ball 
15 yards from the goal as the game 
ended. Another half minute would 
have meant another score.

and leaving their judgment undevel
oped. He made a plea that more men 
come out for the teams and stick, say
ing that the school is noted for its 
gameness and that he would like to 
see this years teams remembered for 
years to come.
Mr. McCullough, director of ath
letics, the told how he and Dr. Marks 
had been coming over to the Science 
School about three times a year for 
the last four years to talk to the stu
dents, but that their efforts were in 
vain if the seudent body wouldnt 
back their sentiments, and if a football 
squad which started out with eighty 
men could dwindle in two weeks to 
scarcely enough for two teams, then 
something was radically wrong which 
would have to be remedied by the stu
dents themselves.
Another way in which the students 
can help athletics is to select capable 
and willing men for managers and assitant managers.
In conclusion, he said that the few 
who were doing the most were the 
most willing to do more, but that 
the solution to the whole problem is 
in the hands of the students in gen
eral.
Mr. Kelly, the trainer of the Brook
lyn National League Club, was then 
introduced by Mr. McCullough as 
Techs new trainer, to which the stu
dents responded with a cheer. Some, 
however, seemed to think that the 
selection of Ach Du Lieber, with 
three Kellys on the end was some
what of a contrast.
Mr. Gilson, the editor-in-chief of 
the Tartan, briefly outlined the aim 
and policy of the school paper, stating 
that it has always endeavored to rep
resent truthfully and accurately the 
events and activities around school, 
and that the personal opinions of the 
staff have always been subservient to 
the general sentiment of th eschool, 
no one man nor any clique having 
ever dominated the management. The 
Tartan is exchanged with high school 
and university papers and thus wide
ly represents the school and its spirit. 
To be successful, therefore, the Tar
tan must have the general support as 
well as the financial support of the 
students. The competition for a place 
as reporter gives a chance for the 
students to show their appreciation 
as well as to support the paper by 
collecting news items and placing 
them in the Tartan boxes.
Mr. Kelcey, manager of the adver
tising bureau, announced that about 
$4,000 worth of advertising would be 
done in the school publications this 
year by merchants, and that whenever 
possible the students should buy from 
advertisers. A slip of coupons is en
closed in tvery Tartan, and students 
making purchases should leave one 
with the merchant.
Football Manager Haaren then said 
that the best price the management 
could get for the Beaver Falls trip 
would be $1.15 for the round .trip, and 
$.30 for admission, making a total of 
$1.45, exclusive of incidentals.

Machinery Hall. Important changes 
were adopted in the constitution in 
order that it might conform with the

The annual election of the Senior 
class of the School of Applied Science 
was held recently. These officers act 
not only for the Senior year, but also 
for the class when alumni.
The method of electing the presi
dent and the vice president differed 
somewhat from the usual method and 
was as follows. The nominations 
were made by each member of the 
class writing his choice for president 
on a ballot, and the six receiving the 
highest number of votes were voted 
upon repeatedly, the lowest dropping 
out each time, until two were left and 
of these the higher one was decalred 
president, and the other vice presi
dent. The other officers were elected 
in the usual way. The results of the 
election were as follows:
PresidentWilliam Miller.
Vice PresidentArthur H. McGill.
SecretaryCharles R. Holzworth.
TreasurerJanies E. Wilson.

It is with deep regret that we must 
not the passing away of the historic 
young hydraulic lab. (Historic be
cause the Junior Mechanicals swam in 
it last spring and young mecause it 
lived only five months.) It was an
nounced before the erection of the 
building that it was to be a temporary 
structure, and oh, how nobly did its 
designer fulfill those intentions! As 
the doctors say, it has gradually been 
failing and sinking, until its condition 
is now so low that all hope has been 
abandoned and the end is not far off. 
If the Biblical injunction had been fol
lowed and the lab. builded upon a 
rock, the storms might come and the 
rains fall and the waves beat upon 
that rock, but the lab. would fall not.
We dont want to tell now how it 
might have been, but we can hardly 
refrain from pointing out that if the 
lab. had been built at the bottom of 
the hollow this would never have hap
pened.
P. S. Professor Drinks defines a 
guy rope as follows: A guy rope is 
something used to hold up a hydraulic 
lab.
President, Claude Ettele; vice presi
dent, A. S. Hines; secretary, K. S. 
Henning, and treasurer, A. M. Steven

by the Science Sophomores at their 
organization Tuesday noon.
The meeting was opened with a 
short speech by A. M. Starling, nomi
nating the candidate afterwrads elect
ed president. Nominations then came 
thick and fast until six names were 
on the board, not including Katzmans 
pointing nomination of Fagan, then 
officiating.
It was decided to call the man sec

dent, and so the nominations for sec
retary and for treasurer alone re
mained. There were four nominees 
for the former and five for the latter 
office.
October 7, 1913, the upper an dmiddle classes of the School of Applied 
Industries held a meeting in which 
they elected members for the student 
senate for the present semester.
Th studnt senate is a student organ

disorderly students. It is composed 
of seven members, six being elected 
by the upper and middle classes, and 
one being chosen by them from the 
Plebe class. The following are the 
members who were elected:
Upper Class  Carney, Charlton, 
Fish, More.
Middle ClassMolton, Fry.
After the above meeting the upper

The first mass meeting of the year 
was held at the athletic field last Fri
day afternoon. There was only a 
moderate attendance. Savage and 
Merril alternated in leading the stu

Later Mr. McDowell, the leader of the 
Glee Club, took charge, and had the 
students rehearse the new Tech song. 
A short speller and a long Carnegie 
then ended the meeting.
Wm. Pfouts, head instructor in 
Pattern making, School of Applied 
Industries, has been laid up since the 
first week of school. He has been 
troubled with an abcess in his throat 
and it was necessary to undergo four 
operations, none of a very serious 
nature, during the past week. It is 
expected that he will be able to re
sume his classes on Monday, October 
20th.

We have classified our advertisers so that our readers may use the list 
for reference before making purchases. The grouping furnishes an excellent 
variety of merchants for any article which a student, alumnus or faculty 
member would be likely to buy, and there is no valid reason of which we are 
aware that would justify anyone interested in the welfare of The Tartan in 
making purchases from any but merchants who so kindly make such a publi
cation possible. Be sure, also, to give one of the purchase stubs, which you 
will find enclosed in your Tartan every other week, to the clerk from whom 
j-ou make the purchase. The stubs, we have found, make pleased advertisers 
and help to get new ones. May we depend upon YOU to take this as a re
sponsibility to your Institution and to The Tartan.

A group of ten honor students at 
the Carnegie Institute of Technology 
are receiving the congratulations of 
their classmates as a result of their 
being officially announced last week, 
as the recipients of the entrance 
scholarships for the college year of 
1913-14.
The basis on which the awards are 
made is competitive, the winners be
ing the candidates who pass the en
trance requirements with the highest 
ratings. In every instance, however, 
certain qualities of character are de
termining factors as well as schol
arship ability. Applications for these 
scholarships are made during the year 
preceding the time a student reports 
for entrance. The tenure of a schol
arship is conditional upon the at
tendance, conduct and progress of the 
appointee being satisfactory.
Two kinds of awards were made 
this year, entrance scholarships and 
tuition scholarships. Each entrance 
scholarship amounts to a cash stipend 
of $100, and the remission of fees,

course the student is taking. The 
fortunate winners in this list are Fred 
J. Buehler, of 6119 Hoeveler street, 
Pittsburgh; Bennett Cardwell, of 
Rustburg, Va.; Miss Cecelia Hillman, 
of 238 Atwood street, Pittsburgh; Er
nest F. Lundeen, of Tolleston, Ind.; 
and William A. Voyce, of Denver, 
Col.
Those receiving the tuition scholar
ships, which consist in a student be
ing exempt from the payment of fees, 
and which represents a cash equiva
lent of from thirty to fifty dollars, 
are Wallace E. Alberts, of 706 Col
lege avenue, Pittsburgh; Miss Jean 
Barr, of 221 Hilands avenue, Ben 
Avon, Pa.; Miss Helen Brady, of Erie, 
Pa.; George H. Jacobson, of Kalamzoo, Mich., and John W. Towns, of

GRAND.
The refined vaudeville perform
ance? in the Grand Opera House dur
ing the week beginning Monday 
afternoon, October 20th, will include 
the first demonstrations in Pittsburgh 
of the telegraphic powers of Mercedes 
and Mile. Stantone, a young couple 
who have excited a sensation in Lon
don and Paris and are now shaking 
up the dry bones in America.
Another interesting number in the 
program for next week will be con
tributed by Homer Miles and Com
pany. It is called On the Edge of 
Things, and is an elaborate scenic 
production of a one-act play written 
by Mr. Miles and staged by Tom Bar
rie.

ing and altogether novel features in 
the program for the week of the 20th.

Next week the Davis Players will 
present, twice daily and for the first 
time in stock, perhaps the most popu
lar of all musical comedies in the 
past decade, The Time, the Place 
and the Girl.
The Time, the Place and the Girl 
is told in three acts, and the scenes 
are located in and around a sanitar
ium at a mountain resort. Every 
member of the compny will have a 
role particularly to his or her liking, 
and the regular cast and the orchestra 
will be augmented for the big produc
tion. The characters which Mr. Hall, 
the leading man, and Miss Oshier will 
portray are not dissimilar to those 
in which they were so popular in 
George Cohans Forty-five Minutes 
from Broadway.
The popular songs of this comedy 
include I Dont Like Your Family, 
Thursday Always Was My Jonah 
Day, The Waning Honeymoon, 
Dont You Tell I Love You, Its 
Lonesome Tonight and Blow the 
Smoke Away.
