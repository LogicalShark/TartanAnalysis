DORMITORIESTHE BEANERY FOOTBALL SQUAD
Design School Has New Secretary.
The beginning of each school year 
brings forth various changes and al
terations in every department of the 
school, its faculty, its students, its 
equipment, its activities, and hereto
fore such changes have tended toward 
the progress which characterizes the 
development of The Carnegie Insti
tute of Technology.
No great radical changes have been 
brought about in the faculty, although 
several of the older Professors and in
structors have chosen new scenes of 
activity arid new appointments have 
been made to fill their vacancies.
In the Science school the many 
friends of Prof. C. B. Stoner will re
gret to learn that he is now with the 
Hotels Statler Co. with Buffalo as his 
headquarters. Prof. F. Colette will 
confine the greater part of his efforts 
toward the improvement of the stu
dents of the Design school this year 
instead of being with the Science men. 
Mr. O'. W. Greubel will be engaged in 
the department of languages at the 
University of Wisconsin. Mr. S. T. 
Yount, like many other good Ameri
can citizens, has decided to manufac
ture war material, being engaged with 
the Dupont Powder Co. Other mem
bers of the Science faculty who will 
not be present this year are Dr. M. 
S. Gaba and Mr. T. L. Miller.
In the School of Applied Indus
tries Dr. Walter Libby has left and 
is continuing studies at Oxford Uni
versity, England. Mr. J. J. McDonald 
has gone back to practice, having been 
an instructor in bricklaying. Mr. 
Frank G. Perley, formerly instructor 
in Physics, will not return this year.
The faculty of the Design school 
seems to have been more fortunate in 
retaining its members inasmuch as 
their loss in members is confined to 
only two members. Mr. Coil is en
gaged with Cass Gilbert, architects 
in New York. Mr. Doughlas W. Ross, 
assistant Professor of Dramatic Art, 
will not be present this year.
More familiar faces will be removed 
from the faculty of the M. M. C. S. 
than any of the four schools. Miss 
Viola Anderson will study at Sim
mons College this year. Miss Frances 
Higgins is now studying at Columbia 
University in New York City. Miss 
Caroline Jesse, formerly instructor in 
Fre.ich, is now assistant Professor at 
Goucker College in Baltimore. Other 
members of the M. M. C. S. faculty 
who will not be present this year are:

really
It was hard to believe 
that the dormitories had really ar
rived after these long years of wait
ing, talking, and disappointment. But 
thanks to the initiative, indefatigable 
energy, and push of Director Hamerschlag, the two handsome brick 
lodges grew up this summer on 
Woodlawn avenue, across from the 
gym. and all rooms are now filled by 
the student occupants.
Any doubt as to the way they would 
take, was dispelled by the rush of ap
plications ir.? summer, mt 1 a large 
waiting list was left after a1! the rooms 
were assigned. The announcement 
tha* key.' would be given out or. the 
last registration day brong.it a crovd 
to A1 Hcyls office at the lime as all 
were anxious to take oosscss'on at 
once.
But unfortunately owing to a strike 
this summer and the unreliability of 
one of the furniture contractors, part 
of the dormitories were either incom
plete or unfurnished. But there were 
beds and bedding in plenty, however, 
and there was a general rush for the 
best positions on the sleeping porches. 
Some of the rooms contained tables 
and others chifforobes, but the ma
jority of students were compelled to 
do without for several days. It was 
pitiful in the extreme to see the poor 
home-sick Plebes sitting on a bare bed 
with his suit case on his knees, writ
ing to home and mother.
Beds were placed in all rooms on 
Saturday and the contractor turned 
over the building and withdrew the 
watchmen. Sunday someone discov
ered the rugs in a certain room in one 
of the lodges and there was a grand 
rush to get to the small pile of the 
more expensive ones first. One egre
gious Plebe tried to secure enough for 
bed covering besides but was nailed 
by an upperclassman. Monday and 
Tuesday the remainder of the furni
ture arrived and made things more 
comfortable. Desk lights, radiator 
seats and curtains are yet to come. 
Valet service has not yet been sup
plied, the students having to unpack 
their own trunks, and breakfast is not 
yet served in the rooms but doubtless 
these minor details will be taken care 
of later.
The government of the dormitories 
is entirely in the hands of the students 
themselves as there will be no proc
tors. It will be an interesting experi
ment and it is to be hoped that the 
students will make it successful. Each 
dormitory will probably meet and 
regulate the hours for quiet but at
Qontinned on Page 4
Brighter and better than ever, with 
the former bare white walls covered 
with several coats of paint, the Bean
ery opened its doors to its fecond 
season at lunch time a week ago last 
Wednesday. This event had been an
ticipated and the usual clash of dishes 
and tne bread line along the walk be
spoke to an outsider that the Tech 
student was once more being fed per 
gram and per calovie and by the way 
this same line extended for almost an 
hour, over half way around the build
ing last Monday and all theories of 
scientific feeding went up the chimney 
when the supply of victuals below 
ran out. For once the hungry student 
went back to the simple meal of bread 
and milk.
The policy of the Beanery remains 
the same for this year. Only the best, 
purest and most healthful of foods 
will be served. Actual cost plus serv
ice alone determines the price of each 
article and make up of the menu of 
the meal. There is no profit at all re
maining. This idea was developed by 
the administration last year and has 
been strictly adhered to.
Gas, water, power and equipment 
are furnished free by the school. As 
much student labor as is possible is 
employed. As efficient methods as 
are known are used in the kitchen, the 
latest improvements in cooking, wash
ing and other apparatus having been 
installed.
The powers that be are to be con
gratulated in securing as manager 
Miss Lloyd, formerly of the M. M.
C. S. restaurant, and a graduate of 
that school and on the retention as 
assistant of Miss Luccas, whose un
tiring efforts last year made much of 
the Beanerys success possible. Dr. 
Esquerre will have charge of the 
whole system and of the selection and 
method of preparation of the food. 
Two male chefs will be employed, 
one of whom is already on the job.
The hours of service for this year 
will be: Breakfast, 7:30-8:30; lunch, 
11:30-1:30, and 11:30-1:00 on Satur
days, and dinner, 5-6:30. Sunday 
breakfast is from 9:30 to 10:30 and 
dinner from 4 to 5. Positively no 
meals or food will be served at any 
other time.
The scale of prices remains the same 
except that individual prices for extra 
dishes have been lowered. Lunch and 
dinner are 20 cents; breakfast 15 cents, 
and the Sunday chicken dinner 30 
cents. A ticket for seven breakfasts, 
six lunches and seven dinners includ
ing Sunday may be purchased for 
$3.50. .

HARD AT WORK
New Varsity Quarters in Gym.
Coach Steffen arrived in the city 
Monday morning and of course foot
ball practice commenced that after
noon. Also with Mr. Steffen came 
Mrs. Steffen and Fritz, the latter the 
same cute baby of last year, but con
siderably bigger.
About twenty reported the first day, 
which number increased to fifty in a 
week, four squads working at one time 
on the field. Familiar faces were not 
as frequent an occurrence as one 
would wish, Capt. Lauer, Marshall, 
Helstrom, Kesner, and Fletcher being 
the only letter men in sight. Kelley 
reported Monday of this week. Holzworth, Smith, Greenlich and Freemuth 
were others of last years squad to 
report.
Among the new men, backfield can
didates are numerous. Altdoefer, 
Findlay and Garrett are three who 
make an excellent impression in that 
department. The former played one 
year for Brown University and was 
one of the star punters and line 
plungers of the east. He has made 
an excellent showing here so far. 
Findlay and Garrett, the latter from 
the middle west, also show up well. 
The former has been running signals 
at half back and while Garrett who 
has a reputation behind him, was play
ing at quarter on Monday. Bollinger 
of Peabody has also been noticed.
In the line, McFeaters of Greensburg High; Hines of basketball and 
baseball fame, are two promising new 
men. Gilson is also a new candidate 
for end. There are several other men 
among the squad who give promise of 
developing well for these positions, 
including Young of Grove City.
Practice so far has been only of an 
elementary nature and has prevented 
any real sizing up of the prospects. 
The coach is non-committal and even 
slightly dubious. Things look as 
though we would have a very strong 
backfield and it can be also easily seen 
that the main problem will be to de
velop a line, especially tackles.
A great improvement in the athletic 
quarters is the new showers and lock
er rooms for the Varsity teams. These 
are located under the old locker rooms 
in the gym. and give the team the 
necessary segregation. The trainers 
room is also now located on this 
floor.
The new field is also available for

WELCOME.
To the faculty and students of Car
negie the Tartan extends a most sin
cere and cordial welcome, upon the 
opening of our second decade. For 
another ten months we are to be to
gether united in a common endeavor 
to acquire a liberal and practical edu
cation. It remains with us to con
tinue to express and show our inter
est in Carnegie, to arouse the true 
Carnegie spirit.
To the new students:We appre
ciate the difficulties with which you 
have been and will be confronted. 
The unaccustomed environment and 
novel experiences of these few months 
are new to most of you. We urge you 
to be patient and persevering, to get 
into the spirit of the place immediate
ly. Upon your registration you have 
become a part of this institution. Now 
lend your support and individuality to 
the up-building of our standards, to 
the developing a spirit of loyalty to 
your future Alma Mater, Carnegie.
THE OUTLOOK OF THE 
TARTAN.
The editorial policy of the Tartan 
of the past year will be strictly ad
hered to. A policy framed for the 
best interests of the student body in 
view. No mere muck-raking will be 
done; nothing will be criticized un
less there is constructive suggestion 
to accompany it. The interests of 
the entire student body cannot be sac
rificed to keep a single individual or 
a group of individuals in a pleasant 
state of mind. Only frankness pays. 
We shall continue, at least at pres
ent, with the regular weekly cartoons 
and interesting news. We beg the
students to help us make this a paper 
that is second to none. We can do 
it with your support. The Tartan 
shall issue quite a large number of 
special issues that will be worthy of 
keeping in your future library.
The Tartan staff is open in all posi
tions for competition. Get in line and 
work. We need all the new men and 
the old students to try for places on 
our staff. Inducements worthy of 
consideration are given. In an early 
issue such will be described.
A campaign for subscriptions to the 
Tartan will be evident in a few days. 
One way to help your paper is to 
subscribe. We need the support of 
all of Carnegie.
THE PUPPET.
Another publication of an entirely 
new nature has been introduced into 
our institution. It is called the Pup
pet, and will be issued four times 
a year, the first issue the middle of 
October, and will be of a humorous 
nature.
The cover pages of this twenty-four 
page magazine will be a noteworthy 
feature. Heretofore college maga
zines have used only a single color 
process in printing. The Puppet is to 
use the three-color process which 
will produce in finish about seven 
distinct colors. The editors have made 
arrangements to have it placed in at 
the newstands of the hotels, etc., by 
the Union News Co., and also it will 
be sold on all train pulling out of the 
city. This will tend to greatly adver
tise our school. Illustrations and car
toons are to be of the finest character 
and the designing and drawing of the 
same is open to all who desire to 
compete.
The staff is as follows: Bridgeon 
Smith, Editor-in-Chief; J. A. Carothers, Assistant Editor-in-Chief; J. C. 
Sawders, Business Manager; H. W. 
Ludwig, Assistant Business Manager; 
A. Brady McSwigan, Art Editor; 
Charles Meredith, Athletic Editor; 
Karl H. Fulton and Charles Meredith, 
Associate Editors; M. B. Garber, Ad
vertising Manager; Louge Sprague 
and Guy Kelcey are also connected 
with the magazine. Many of the men 
in the staff have already had practical 
work upon our foremost publications. 
The Tartan wishes the new magazine 
the best that car be.
Where will you be on November
6th?
Start saving for that Case trip now.
We want five hundred students 
marching up Euclid avenue behind the 
band on November 6th.
The Puppet has ten points on 
Heinzs fifty-seven.
Does everyone know what Puppet 
means now?
The Puppet will have to purchase 
a new scoreboard. Some advertisers.
Everyone is awaiting that first issue. 
Of what? Foolish question.
LETTER FROM PROF. DAY.
Is Recruiting in Canada.
Many of the Tech students will re
call the time last spring when Profes
sor Frank P. Day left the Margaret 
Morrison Carnegie School to render 
services to his country in the present 
great struggle, and many of us, in 
fact all of us, who were intimately 
acquainted with him remember with 
what regret we viewed his departure. 
The Director is in receipt of a letter 
from Professor Day which will be of 
great interest to every Tech student, 
which we publish with a feeling of 
pride. Regardless of the individual 
interests or prejudice one may have in 
the war, it is impossible to read this 
letter without being touched with the 
heroism displayed by this man who 
was in our midst. We feel assured 
that his humble request will be will
ingly met by the girls of the M. M.
C. S. His letter reads as follows:
Fredericton, New Brunswick, 
Sept. 9, 1915.
Dear Director:
I am in the midst of a vigorous re
cruiting campaign. The Government 
has sent me to York County to raise 
recruits for the Empires army. The 
Canadians have at last awakened to 
the fact that we must have men and 
more men or we must say good-bye to 
the British Empire. Consequently we 
are straining every nerve to get re
cruits by this wretched voluntary sys
tem. Last week I spoke ten times with 
varying success. One night in Fred
ericton twelve men came forward, an
other night eight and last night from 
the tiny village of Taymouth nine 
good men and true stepped forward 
to fight for their country. I employ 
all the methods of the notorious Billy 
Sunday, pleading, entreating, telling 
fearful stories of the atrocities in Bel
gium, praying, shouting and at times 
almost cursing. Nearly all the meet
ings are in the open air. Any rostrum, 
the back of an automobile, the top of 
a carriage or an upturned box serves 
the purpose. Sometimes I speak in 
dingy country halls with frightened 
women and children on one side and 
stolid farmer boys on the other. One 
night, a man came up to sign and a 
woman burst into tears crying over 
and over again, My mans going to 
the war, My mans going to the 
war. Sometimes, I have a revulsion 
of feeling and say to myself, God for
give me for persuading these lads to 
go for many will never return. Then 
I strengthen myself with the thought 
that we are right, and that I will al
ways be willing to accept more risk 
than any of the lads I will command.
We have filled the 55th Battalion 
and we expect to fill the 65th in a fort
night. I will then be sent to organize 
five counties in Southern Nova Scotia 
for my own Battalion, the 105th Bluenose.
This letter is written in very bad 
style for it is being composed after a 
hard days work. In fact I have al
most forgotten that I ever was a pro
fessor .in English.
As the Carnegie students gather 
this September, however, my thoughts
will turn often to the school in Pitts
burgh. That reminds me of a plan 
I formed this summer. I expecc that 
the men of my regiment will be short 
of socks this winter, as the men al
ways are and I have been wondering 
if a eqties* for a pair from ea:h girl in 
the Margaret Morrison School would 
n:eet with r. response. Of roursc, 
each girl wc.ulo have to knit her own
I.air a;j<l put her name md address 
thereon or the socks would (NACE fifty 
per cent of their values.
I will now close, sir, by thanking 
you for your many kindnesses, by 
sending my regards to Mrs. Hamerschlag and the members of the faculty 
and the staff of the Carnegie Institute 
of Technology. I hope that I may 
be spared to come back to you some 
day. Mabel is coming to join me to
night.
Sincerely and respectfully yours, 
(Signed) FRANK DAY, 
Major, Recruiting Office, 
York Co., N. B. 
P. S.I have sent forward 42 recruits 
in two weeks. Many other of course 
applied but were rejected by the Doc
tor. There are 14 counties in New 
Brunswick. If each county has done 
as well, we have recruited 42 x 14 
588 men in this province in the last 
fortnight and the work is just begin
ning. . I expect we may send 300,000 
men from Canada before the war is 
over.
F. P. D.
Director Hamerschlag addressed the 
entering classes in the Design Thea
tre Thursday morning, welcoming 
them to the institution. He mentioned 
the history of each of the four schools 
and told of the ideals connected with 
each. The organization of the insti
tution from the trustees to the in
structor was then described and the 
manner in which all were interdepend
ent on the other. The director men
tioned the cosmopolitan make-up of 
the student body and spoke on the 
high registration of this year.
Dead Breed was introduced and 
said a few words on student govern
ment at M. M. C. S. Dean Connelley, 
Mr. Steffen and Dr. Marks were also 
introduced.
RADIO CLUB.
There will be a special meeting of the 
Radio Club in the tower club room of 
Machinery Hall tonight at 7:30 P. M. 
Anyone in the institution interested 
in radio work is urged to attend.

FALL FESTIVAL CONCLUDES 
CONTESTS.
Plebes and Sophs Bury the Hatchet.
On Friday evening, September 17, 
the conclusion of the contests be
tween the Sophomores and the Plebes 
was carried out in a pageant center
ing around the burial of the hatchet 
of strife between the two classes. The 
pageant was a triumph in every re
spect and excited much favorable com
ment among spectators and represen
tatives of the press.
The evenings entertainment con
sisted of a pageant called the Festi
val of Burying the Hatchet, in a 
Prologue, a Plan and an Epilogue. 
The words were by Messrs. Stevens, 
Cowley and Viehman. F. K. Cowley 
was general director, while Messrs. 
Steen and McConnell were very effi
cient stage managers.
The prologue consisted of dia
logues between education and the 
spirits of the North, South, East and 
West. The latter were desirous of 
obtaining Education and Learning so 
that Education sent to each a messen
ger with a flaming torch to guide them 
to him. Education spoke to them 
and then led them to a side of the 
field, when for their instruction, Edu
cation had a parable vnacted.
A group of Indians in the midst of 
harvest dance was seen, when the 
peace was disturbed by the arrival of 
news of a new tribe, Strong of arm, 
but foolish like children, and with 
heads that are empty. The result of 
the parleying was a defiance to the 
older people, whereupon a bloody bat
tle ensued with many killed and 
wounded on each tribe. However, 
Reason intervened and the newcom
ers begged to sit in humble council. 
The hatchet was then buried in true 
Indian style, thus ending all strife 
between the two lower classes.
The Spirit of the North demanded 
an interpretation of this parable. Ed
ucation called for the various branch
es of learning, languages, mathemat
ics, art, physics, and chemistry, to ex
plain the parable. These branches 
were represented by sandwich men, 
who admirably played their parts. The 
explanations given were rambling crit
icisms of the Plebes, but Education 
explained this by saying that though 
individually they were foolish, when 
one learned all, wisdom was the re
sult.
This ended the pageant and at a 
signal the large pile of wood was ig
nited, making an immense blaze and 
lighting up the whole field. The mem
bers of all the classes assembled on 
the field and started to parade. A 
snake dance was attempted rather dis
astrously but everyone enjoyed him
self.
The letters C. I. T. were formed and 
the school yells and cheers were led 
by Dink Merrill. After this the 
Sophs serve refreshments to the 
Plebes in the Gym, thus concluding 
one of the most successful days in 
the most successful' fall festival yet 
given.

SOPHS WIN CLASS CONTESTS 
FROM PLEBES.
Plebes Work Hard.
Although the Plebes worked hard 
the Sophomores were returned vic
tors in the class supremacy contests 
held on the field Friday afternoon, 
the final score being 30^ to S8D2N The 
Plebes showed very good spirit, al
though not many of them put in an 
appearance, many of them thinking 
that the meeting was to be a hazing 
affair. All of the games were fiercely 
contested, the victors winning the 
combats by small margins.
According to the upper classman 
this years entering class showed up 
better for pep in the contests than 
any other Plebe class. This augurs 
well for lots of spirit at the football 
games this year.
The following is the detailed ac
count of contests:
WrestlingPlebes 6 points; Sophs 3 
points.
LightweightWendell, Plebe, threw 
Goldman, Soph, in 45 seconds. 
MiddleweightBalaurie, Plebe, won 
from Brand, Soph, in 2 min. 42 secs. 
Heavyweight  Holzworth, Soph, 
threw Holland, Plebe, in 1 min. 18 
secs.
Indian BallIn a very interesting 
game the Sophs defeated the Plebes 
6 goals to 1, thereby getting 5 
points.
Tug of WarPlebes won, getting 10 
points.
Field HockeyAt the end of two nine 
minute halves, the score was 1 goal 
to 1 goal, so that each side was 
given 2I2 points.
Relay RaceThis consisted of a twothird mile race with teams of eight 
men each. The Sophs won this 
race although the Plebes showed 
some very excellent sprinting abil
ity. This victory gave the Sophs 
10 more points.
The score at this point was 20^2 to 
S8D2 in favor of the Sophs, so that the 
baseball game was played. The game 
lasted only two innings because of the 
lateness of the start. In the first in
ning the Plebe pitcher had the Sophs 
eating out of his hand and struck them 
out in one, two, three order. The 
Plebes, however, found Wean for a 
good many safeties and as a result 
the score at the end of the first chap
ter stood 7 to 0 in the Plebes favor.
It was discovered that the Plebe 
pitcher had a weakness for left-hand
ed batters. The Sophs then all bat
ted this way and were all given passes 
scoring 11 runs after there were two 
down. The Plebes did not do any
thing in their half of the inning, so
that the final score was 11 to 7 in 
favor of the Sophs. The feature of 
the game was the home run, clouted 
by Doherty, of the Sophs, and the all 
round work of Butts, the Plebe catch
er, who showed surprising good form.

SENIOR-PLEBE SMOKER 
DRAWS FULL HOUSE.
Science Fourth Year Men Give Their 
Plebes the Glad Hand.
Last Saturday, September 18, 1915, 
The Carnegie Student Union room in 
the Central Building held the biggest 
crowd of Science men any social gath
ering has yet brought together in that 
place. And the best part was that 
about half of them were Plebes.
The new plan of having the recep
tion of the Plebes under the super
vision of the Seniors surely worked 
out well, especially from the view
point of the Plebes, for the Senior 
Committee with J. Guter as chairman, 
plus Tom Shea and Shorty Ashworth 
made the new men feel that they were 
part of a school with traditions and 
customs such as any man might be 
proud of, despite the youth of the in
stitution. The expenses of the affair 
were met by a gift of five dollars from 
Dean Leete, and a similar sum from 
each of the upper classes.
There was not a dull moment in the 
evening, for movies, speeches and 
music of all kinds provided an attrac
tion from eight oclock until the 
watchman dispersed the meeting at 
11:15. Following the Carnegie Tech 
Movies, Dean Leete spoke to the 
crowd. After the Dean, Dave Ingalls, 
Senior president; L. L. Beeken, a 
Tech grad of 10, who takes Mr. Red
dings place in the Secretarys office; 
and Tom Shea, Shorty Ashworth, 
W. Earl Boak, Dink Merrill, Red 
Orr, Pick Hines, and Bill Espy all 
made snappy short talks.
There was music in abundance for 
a good bit of which we have the 
School of Applied Industries to thank, 
as Hoxworth, pianist of the evening, 
Heidenkamp and Cost of the guitars, 
and Bobbie Vey of the Dry Schlitz 
Cello, were all from our brother 
school. Aside from this there was the 
laughing song of a considerable por
tion of last years glee club which got 
together on the spur of the occasion, 
and the improved bagpipe, some of 
the clubs voices produced. Design 
contributed its share in Hoffmanns 
reading and Tommy Maleys brave 
attempt (the Design School claims 
Tommy) but the Maggie Murphys 
were present only in the movies.
REGISTRATION RECORDS 
BROKEN.
More Than 700 Plebes Enter.
Another school year! And from all 
appearance the most prosperous ever. 
One way, or at least one indication of 
judging the prosperity of the coming 
year may be gathered from the regis
tration. If this be taken as an omen 
for the future we may well feel op
timistic indeed.
The registration for the school year 
outstrips and breaks every record. 
Each of the four schools shows from 
twenty-five to thirty per cent growth 
in their entering classes. It will be 
difficult to keep the gross registration 
below 3500. Over seven hundred stu
dents have registered in the Fresh
man Class. With this years figures 
the Carnegie Institute of Technology 
becomes the largest engineering 
school in the State of Pennsylvania; 
the largest industrial school; ranks 
fourth in numbers among the colleges 
for women in the state; and its unique 
art school, the School of Applied De
sign, has a department of architecture 
which compares in size with any in 
the country. Students have registered 
from every state in the union and 
from eighteen foreign countries.
There are few if any similar insti
tutions in the country who can boast 
of such rapid strides as have been 
made by Tech during ten years. This 
of course is not only in reference to 
registration figures but also in all 
other respects. The equipment, build
ings, faculty and reputation have all 
grown in proportion to the registra
tion. A few figures relative to the 
growth of the school since its founda
tion may be of interest here. Below 
is presented a table of the number of
men andwomenregisteredsince the

CROSS COUNTRY TEAM.
The cross country team under Cap
tain Rieser has commenced practice 
every evening, when a run is taken 
through the park. Rieser, Moore and 
Walker of last years squad have re
ported so far.
Coach Dull will be out every even
ing in the near future. Several meets 
have been arranged for this year and 
all men aspiring for long distance run
ning are urged to come out. Tech has 
always had successful cross country 
teams and this season should be no 
exception.

SENIORS WELCOME TO THE 
PLEBES.
It is with great pleasure that one 
notes the large number of entering 
Plebes in the Margaret Morrison Car
negie School. So far, 115 girls have 
signified their intention of making 
Tech their Alma Mater. Perhaps it 
is the Seniors who after three years 
experience can most readily give ad
vice. In order to be a happy gradu
ate, one must work hard, in fact, very 
hard, but also one must play hard, 
which means principally school activi
ties, in shortacquire school spirit 
early and keep it forever. Find out 
early whether ones inclinations run 
to drama, charitable work, literature, 
etc., and join the organization which 
represents it and stick to it and work 
for it all your school life. So together 
with the Faculty, Juniors, and Sopho
mores the Seniors of M. M. C. S. wish 
the class of 1919 a most successful 
and brilliant history.
DORMITORIES FOR THE GIRLS.
This year, owing to the large enter
ing class of Plebes, it has been neces
sary to have three dormitories for the 
girls. The Morewood Avenue Dormi
tory remains as before. The house 
next door has also been secured and 
completely renovated, and goes by the 
name of the Annex. All the girls of 
both houses will eat in one large din
ing room, thus bringing the girls to
gether socially. Miss Collingwood 
still will have charge of the girls. In 
the Fifth Avenue Dormitory Mfes 
Marvin of the Secretarial Department 
will live there. All three houses are 
almost completely filled, which speaks 
well for the future acquirement of 
modern, up-to-date dormitories, near 
the school, for the girls attending 
Tech.
FIRST ASSEMBLY.
On Thursday at 9:00, the first As
sembly of the year was held. The 
upperclassmen marched in first; the 
Juniors and Sophomores were ar
ranged at the back, with the Seniors 
in two groups at the foot of the stairs 
in the front. According to custom, 
enough empty seats were left that the 
Plebes might sit at the first assembly, 
if at no other during the year. Then 
under the direction of Miss Stoner, 
the older girls sang the Womans 
Song while the Plebes marched in. 
The long line was headed by the Pres
ident of Student Government, Miss 
Mary Ride, and by the President of 
the Senior Class, Miss Grace Searight.
Dean Breed, in a short talk, gave a 
hearty welcome to all the girls, both 
old and new, reminding the former 
what work lay ahead of them, and ex
plaining to the latter that great things 
were expected of the class of 1919. 
She then continued by urging the girls 
to keep one thought with them dur
ing the coming year, and that is, To 
do a FEW things WELL. Too 
many girls attempt more things than 
they can finish successfully, both in 
school work and school activities. 
Rather do one or two thoroughly, 
than half a dozen in a slip-shod man
ner; in other words, attempt no more 
than lies in ones time and ability to 
accomplish.
The Dean then introduced Dr. Wal
ter Bingham, who comes to us from 
Dartmouth to be the head of the 
Department of Training Teachers of 
all the four schools. Dr. Bingham 
spoke briefly concerning the aim and 
policy of our school and cited Presi
dent Eliot of Harvard as giving the 
aim of that school, To give pleasure 
to one another.
In conclusion the Margaret Morri
son cheer was given, first by the upper 
classmen and after the Plebes had an 
opportunity to learn it, by all the girls.
CHANGES MADE IN FACULTY
Continued from Page 1 
the Misses Ethel M. Baer, Mabel

the British Empire.
The usual high standard of instruc
tion has well been borne in mind in 
the selection of the new appointees 
for the year 1915-16. We greet the 
new members of the faculty with a 
hearty welcome and trust that their

DORMITORIES
Continued from Page 1
present the school authorities have 
made absolutely no regulations.
Several instructors have volunteered 
to help free of charge those dormi
tory students in the evenings who are 
in need of assistance in their studies. 
More information as to this will be 
given out later.
Everything possible has been done 
for the comfort of the occupants. 
Each double room will contain two 
tables, two rugs, a double decker bed, 
a double chifforobe, hat rack, four 
chairs, table lamp curtains, and win
dow seat. The furniture and rugs are 
of a very pleasing design, the former 
being of dark stained walnut, steel 
lockers for soap, towels, etc., are 
placed in the bath rooms. The club 
rooms in the basement will be fur
nished in the same fashion as the 
Carnegie Union. It is doubtful if the 
walls of the rooms will be painted be
fore vacation.
It is hoped that the students will 
all co-operate with the authorities in 
the proper spirit. Especially in the 
matter of the lights is this need. 
Power at present is obtained from 
the city plant and is proving very ex
pensive. A little economy in this line 
will help out a lot.

NOTES FROM PRINTING DE
PARTMENT.
The Department of Printing has 
added to its equipment this summer 
a Golding Press with a safety feeding 
attachment, a Monotype type caster 
with a Monotype keyboard, and a new 
composition kettle. A new type ser
ies, Cloister Italic, was also purchased. 
The floor space of the department was 
increased by two new rooms, one 
which will be utilized for a bindery 
and the other for a stock room.
Mr. Ingham, one of the new instruc
tors in the Printing Department, was 
formerly head printer at the Roycroft 
Shop in Aurora, N. Y. He has also 
had a wide business experience. Mr. 
Spicher, another new instructor, was 
also foreman of the press rooms at 
the same plant.
The Department of Printing has 
formed a new rule in regards to turning 
out work outside of the regular work 
finished in the various courses. In 
the past many have been disappointed 
in obtaining work from the shop due 
to the small number of extra jobs 
which can be turned out owing to the 
requirements of the schedule. In the 
future no requests for outside work 
will be accepted unless first O. K.d 
by Dean Connelley.
INDUSTRY JOTTINGS.
The Industry School has purchased 
a Bausch & Lomb Balopticon for the 
use of the various instructors and de
partments of the school.
Dean Connelley returned September 
2nd from his vacation spent at Long 
Beach, California. Over-work caused 
a breakdown in his health last Febru
ary and he left for the west April 1st. 
While in Portland, Oregon, the dean 
met McGuire, well known to all of 
last years students, and traveled a 
short way into Canada with him.
The majority of the Industry fac
ulty were out of town during the sum
mer. Prof. Calderwood was at At
lantic City; Prof. Leeds was at Old 
Forge, N. Y., and Prof. Morris was at 
Riverview Park, Pa. Prof. Leighon 
spent the summer in New York state, 
Mr. Hartman was at Vermilion, O., 
Mr. Gage at Seneca Lake, N. Y., Mr. 
Lyons was at the Exposition and Mr. 
Burby was in Massachusetts.
During the summer Mr. Young was 
united in marriage to Miss Lindsay, 
formerly secretary to Dean Connelley. 
The couple spent their honeymoon in 
a cottage at Branchport, N. Y.
Carl Peters is expected to return in 
October. J. H. Clark is at present at 
Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and has not been 
heard from.

Can any girl tell me the three

DESIGN COURSES.
With the many improvements of 
the Design School, comes also im
provements in the different courses 
and in the faculty.
Probably the most important 
change which was made was the in
stallation of E. Raymond Bossange 
as Secretary of the School of Applied 
Design. He is a graduate of Colum
bia University, and comes to us direct 
from Cornell University. From this 
man we may expect many things, his 
position being somewhat analogous 
to the dean of our other schools, and 
he is a most capable man for the posi
tion for which he has been selected.
In the Department of Architecture, 
we find that Mr. Bergy has resigned, 
and Mr. Doonberger taking his place, 
and his old subjects being taken up by 
another man. Mr. Koil, teacher of 
Design, has left to take up a practice 
of his own and we have added to the 
teachers of Design, Wm. Pope Bar
ney, and D. D. Ellington, the latter 
coming to us from Columbia, after 
having studied several years in 
France. The in-coming students in 
this course are a very promising 
bunch, and with higher standards of 
scholarship before them that their 
predecessors, we can expect more of 
them as graduates.
To the Department of Drama has 
been added as instructors Mr. F. K. 
Cowley, Mr. Payne, and Mr. B. Iden, 
all very capable men along their spe
cial line. Ross, a last years member 
of the Drama faculty, has left. Al
ready rehearsals are in progress for 
three new plays, one to be given by 
the Plebes called The Liar.
In the Music Department Mr. 
OBrien reports that a very capable 
bunch of students has been held after 
a very extensive weeding out of ineffi
cient and incapable students.
The Department of Decorating fac
ulty is to be found as it was left last 
year. Their efficient faculty not to 
improved upon.
In all we find our faculty in the De
sign School most promising, and even 
with the great disadvantage we have 
for good work just at the present 
time on account of the new wings to 
be cdded to the building, we should 
not find it at all difficult to spend a 
most profitable as well as one of the 
most delightful years of our life at 
Tech during the year of 1915-16.
FOOTBALL SQUAD AT WORK
Continued from Page 1 
practice purposes and was used for 
the first time last Thursday. The old 
field was blasted up and resown this 
summer and now has a thick crop of 
grass.
McCaughey, captain and tackle, and 
Levy, end of last year, are also in 
school this year and will probably re
port this week. Their presence would 
certainly lighten the coachs problems 
to a great extent. McCaughey, it will 
be remembered, was badly injured
near the close of last season and was 
out of school for much of the year.
It is also rumored that there are 
several other men possessing football 
ability who have registered. It is to 
be hoped that common sense, spirit, 
and loyalty will bring them out on the 
field this week.
THIEL NEXT SATURDAY.
The first game of the season comes 
Saturday with Thiel College of Green
ville. While scheduled chiefly for a 
practice game it looks now as though 
we would have a run for our money. 
Thiel has announced their intention 
of getting our goat and have gotten 
together a strong aggregation for 
that purpose, much stronger than 
their team of last year.
This is the first time that the two 
teams have met. The Lutherans made 
a poor start last year but finished 
strongly. These early season games 
against supposedly weak teams are 
dangerous propositions sometimes, as 
the supposedly weaker eleven some
times grows in strength over the sum
mer as a mushroom over night and 
strikes the stronger an unexpected 
blow in the solar plexus in the fall.
As an example of this, watch U. of 
W. Va. at Penn next Saturday. The 
former had a poor season last year 
but they have bestirred themselves 
since and Penn is due for an unpleas
ant surprise on Franklin Field in the 
writers estimation.
It seems almost unnecessary to urge 
each and every student to be in the 
grandstand Saturday. The team needs 
your support and cheering at the 
game is the only way you can give 
it. The Plebes especially have to learn 
the yells and songs. This may sound 
simple but it is one thing to know a 
yell and another to give it in unison. 
It requires a deal of rehearsing. So 
everybody out. It will require a 
mighty strong excuse to keep anyone 
away from cheering the team on to 
victory at their first game, and it will 
be a mighty poor sort of a sport who 
will avail himself of that excuse. Yes, 
bring her along, too, but sit in the 
cheering section.
LETTER FROM J. I. MILLIGAN.
An interesting letter has been re
ceived from Mr. Milligan, which reads 
as follows: '
Plattsburg, Sept. 12th, 1915. 
My dear Mr. Orbin:
Just a line or so to let you know 
that I arrived safely and find the work 
very interesting and instructive. It 
is all out of doors. We are in tents, 
of course. Get up about five and go 
to bed by ten. I do not find the work 
very hard to do as I am in good phys
ical shape. I took that typhoid inocu
lation yesterday, but it did not cause 
any ill effects, except that my left arm 
is somewhat sore yet. The weather 
has been very good so farno rain.
The Camp is in an ideal place on Lake 
Champlain, just south of Plattsburg. 
The work so far has been drilling and 
handling the gun. Next Wednesday 
we start on Target Practice. In the 
afternoons we have had road mapping, 
etc., and lectures in the evening. Will 
write you again soon.
Very truly yours,
JOHN I, MILLIGAN, 
Military Training Camp, 
Plattsburg, N. Y.,

THE GRAND.
Arnold Dalys brilliant dramatic suc
cess, The Regeneration, will be picturized on the screen at the Grand 
Opera House for one week beginning 
next Monday morning, September 20. 
This is an exclusive film drama, which 
will not be viewed in any other theatre 
in the Pittsburgh district. It is a pro
duction by the William Fox Film Cor
poration and is on a large and expen
sive scale. Mr. Davis will enhance 
the vivid story of New York settle
ment life which The Regeneration 
so graphically unfolds, with an elab
orate musical program to be rendered 
by Pittsburghs symphony orchestra 
of twenty-five artist musicians, a con
cert grand pipe organ and a group of 
mixed voices. An appropriate arrange
ment of timely selections, chosen be
cause they fit in with the locale of 
The Regeneration and introduced in 
a manner calculated to amplify the 
effects of the photographic drama, 
has been made by Director Gilbert C. 
Friar. These will give florid musical 
color to the swiftly changing scenes 
and the stirring action. The play is 
in five acts and is based on the origi
nal story of Owen Kildare, which was 
published in book form under the title 
of My Mamie Rose.

CAMP LOUISE CARNEGIE.
There was a gloomy bunch of Civils 
assembled at Camp Louise Carnegie 
at Glencairn on the noon of August 
24th; they seemed stunned at the early 
beginning of school. After a fine din
ner of beans, however, the ice went 
out with a roar. This feeling was ac
centuated in the evening by the merry 
girls of Freeport, who evidently re
ceived the present Seniors judging by 
early arrival at camp that night.
Professor Stanton was in direct 
charge of the camp this year, as for
mer Prof. Day will be absent this 
year. Prof. Mott was in attendance 
at camp during the greater part of the 
time. Prof. Thayer had charge of the 
railroad party. Mr. Dolan and Lightcap was in charge of the Junior Civils 
and Miners.
Profs. McCullough, Lose, and Mr. 
Simmons, and Dunnell came for the 
shorter course.
The weather this year was particu
larly fine. The first week was fairly 
cold, but not sufficiently cold to both
er the horny Civils. The last two 
weeks were quite warm.
The work this year went along in a 
snappy manner. The Junior Civils 
had a great appetite for work. There 
was one gang especially worthy of 
mention on account of much research 
work, namely, Gellen and Rezofsky, 
who ferreted out a method of running 
levels without backsights.
The eats were good in the opinion 
of the majority. Chicken and ice 
cream prevailed on Sundays. Every 
one is wondering, however, where all 
the profit went.
Geeks Prides, one evening, amid 
much noise, challenged the world to 
contests of strength, agility and 
skill. The challenge fell on deaf 
ears, however. Smullen and Coe 
tipped over a canoe and swallowed 
the river; some got all their clothes, 
too. A couple of young men appeared 
at breakfast the last Sunday complete
ly dressed. Later the same men went 
to bed. Their behavior was a deep 
mystery.
The Seniors were at all times made 
officers of the day. This, in the minds 
of most fellows, accounted for the 
continual honorable mention of Sen
ior tents for extraordinary neatness. 
Tent No. 20 occupied by Coe, Sherban, Rowe and Orr would have re
ceived popular favor.
Many visitors came to enjoy brief 
stays at camp. Among these were 
the Director, Secretary Fields, Mr. 
and Mrs. Beeken.
The camp was progressing in fine 
shape until the arrivals of the men 
taking the two week course. This ad
dition to the family overloaded var
ious facilities in camp. Anyone ex
cept the Civils and Miners could be 
identified by their leggings.
The entire crew went up to Freeport 
to buy Seitz ice cream, on Tech night 
at the Opera House. Without doubt 
every one appreciated the kind invi
tation of Freeports leading man.
Vierheller and Hines extended their 
field of operation far beyond Free
port; they might have gone much far
ther but they walked enough in day
light to satisfy themselves. Wayne 
Wilson developed a decided tendency 
toward the ladies. The rest of the 
fellows were afraid the old lady would 
adopt him, so they forcibly removed 
the young gallant from her presence.
During the last week, insomnia at
tacked the camp; everyone slept by 
fits and starts. Some dark figures 
would be seen near a tent, then a 
heavy fall with creaking of springs. 
A white figure would leap out into 
the darkness and pour out a volley of 
sweet thoughts. Then a voice from 
across Broadway would call, At a 
boy, Murph. One of these mystic 
revivals came on New Years. Who 
says it cant be done? I dont care 
for any ham, thank you. It reached 
a point where a God-fearing man 
nailed his bed down. Thus strategy 
saved several lives.
All fellow-love came to a head the 
last night. The corn roast began at 
twelve and ended at three. Everyone 
loved his neighbor so well that he did 
not turn in until daylight. Goldberg 
hunted snipes far back in the country. 
He became fatigued from holding the 
sack open, and put a stick in it. Prov
idence watched over Red Merrill 
the last night.
Cost was always on hand with good 
music, and Coe and Sherwood with 
their sweet voices and the devil only 
knows what else. Noon hour religious 
services were held in tent No. 20. 
Kerin read the Bible, Coe and Sherry 
expounded the text in a most lucid and 
pleasing manner.
The camp as a whole was excep
tionally well managed; the faculty 
stayed well to the southern end of 
camp. Pleasant recollections of the
1915 camp are general.
NOTES FROM PHYSICS DE
PARTMENT.
The Department of Physics, School 
of Applied Science, has received a new 
Macbeth Illuminator with which the 
illumination of various of the class
rooms and laboratories will be meas
ured in co-operation with Mr. Orbin 
and the department of equipment. The 
results will probably be used to secure 
more efficient lighting in the build
ings. A new ten-foot grating spectro
scope for solar and other spectrum 
observation has also been installed.
Prof. Hower spent the summer in 
Beechland, Ohio. Dr. Grondahl was 
at Sun Lake, Minnesota, and Dr. Da
visson was superintending the con
struction of his summer home near 
Mt. Dessert Island, Maine.

the Weber and Fields all-star com
pany, Ziegfields Follies, Little 
Miss Fix-it and Maid in America, 
has ever been welcomed in the varie
ties, and her engagement here next 
week promises to emphasize particu
larly her popularity in Pittsburgh.
Another star in the bill next week 
whose coming cannot fail to arouse 
pleasantest anticipation is Julian Rose, 
late of Potash and Perlmutter. Mr. 
Rose will be recalled as the Abe in 
that highly successful road show.
Santly and Norton, a couple of 
singers, will render comic songs with 
humorous trimmings. General Ed. 
Lavine, who is back from the front, 
will tell how he was soldiered all 
his life and betwen his merry jests 
will do a bit of juggling. Prevost and 
Brown promise a few minutes of fool
ishness in which they will do some 
acrobatic stunts that are grotesque. 
In addition to a variety of other at
tractions of the same Keith quality, 
Mr. Davis program next week will 
include a special view of exclusive 
moving pictures.
Favorite stars of musical comedy, 
the drama, the opera and the music 
halls will make the refined vaudeville 
performances in the New Davis Thea

Students should understand that the 
restaurant is theirs to make or break 
and is for their benefit alone. A little 
thoughtfulness on the part of the pat
rons and a co-operation on their part 
with the management will help con
siderably. The case of the sugar is 
typical. No more should be used 
than is actually need as sugar costs 
mounts up considerably. The speed 
with which those in line can be served 
would also be greatly increased if each 
patron would hurry along the counter 
with his tray as fast as possible. Also 
any constructive criticism is always 
welcomed and, lest we forget, any 
compliments would probably be equal
ly so.

Averse To Slang.
Just to show how much averse to 
slang he was a small boy in a Chicago 
school explained to the teacher one 
day that he had been walking with 
a friend, but neglected to take off his 
hat when they met a lady they both 
knew. His friend nudged him and 
whispered:
Take off your lid, you simp! 
What he should have said, ex
plained the boy, was, Remove your 
hat, you nut! 
The general sentiment is summed 
up in the words of a small boy, who 
ventured this:
Anyways, its only roughnecks 
who use slang nowadays.Philadel
