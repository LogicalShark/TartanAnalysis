HOME CONCERT.
A Remarkable Success.
At 8:30 the Glee Club appeared 
on the stage, and sang Amici. It 
was followed immediately by the 
Mandolin Club with Rossinis Wil
helm Tell. Though perhaps not of 
a college-like character, selections of 
the latter kind serve better than any
thing else to bring out the ability of 
the mandolin players. When the Glee 
Club is there to provide for the live
ly part of the program and the funny 
stunts, the Mandolin Club should not 
hesitate to show its capability of pro
ducing classical music, especially 
when musical talent is present to su
pervise its rendition. Instead of giv
ing the concert an uncollege-like char
acter, the production of such pieces 
furnishes a desirable variety and pre
vents the program from becoming 
one-sided. The truth of this remark 
is sufficiently shown by the success 
of the Home Concert. Wilhelm Tell 
proved a good introduction to the 
Glee Clubs Scissors Grinder, while 
after the rendition of Chopins Noc
turne the audience more than other
wise appreciated,, Griswolds Octette 
of dummies. Mr. Griswold evidently 
has made a conscientious study of 
the technique of playing pipe 
organs,  also study of the 
effect of electrict currents upon the 
human muscles and respiratory sys
tem. If Griswold had not yet suc
ceeded in preparing the audience for 
further marvelous developments, the 
character sketch Whos Who in Car
negie certainly did. Mr. Crawford 
is to be congratulated upon his ar
rangement of this part of the pro
gram. The merits of Director Hamerschlag, Secretary Field, Deans Leete, 
Connelly, Hornbostel and West, and 
last not least, Mr. Carnegie, were dis
cussed in poetry, and Mr. Moss on a 
drawing board cleverly presented 
their respective physiognomies to the 
audience. Taking into account the 
short time spent in producing them, 
Mr. Moss drawings showed a sus
picious resemblance, and we are in
formed that he deserves full credit 
for making them.
With Signor Scalzos Reverie the 
first part of the program closed. This 
composition was dedicated to Direct
or Hamerschlag. Its name, Souvenir 
des Alpes, is happily chosen. It pos
sesses that soft, graceful melody of 
nature that reminds one of the pure 
air of the woods, of high mountain 
chains covered with snow and forests. 
Combined with this melody there is 
the peculiar sound made by the bells 
of flocks climbing the mountain sides. 
Signor Scalzo has composed this 
piece especially for the Mandolin 
Club, and it is hoped that its success

WHITE FRIARS.
A simple heading, yet one that 
means much to those who are inter
ested in the fortunes of this impor
tant factor in our Student Activities. 
It means that for the first time in 
many a long and weary month the 
Tartan has newsreal newsto tell 
of the White Friars, our only Dra
matic organiation, and the one that 
reaches most directly into our every
day life. For where is the average 
student, the average American of to
day to whom things theatrical dc not, 
in some way appeal? Here it is that 
the White Friars concerns the stu
dent in The Carnegie Technical 
Schools, most intimately: it brings to 
him in his everyday life the theatrical 
element with all its allurement; the 
opportunity to take part in a theat
rical production, not among strangers 
but in the midst of his fellow friends 
and companions, in a friendly rivalry 
for place in either cast or chorus; to 
receive the inestimable value of the 
training in self-possession; expression 
and carriage before large audiences; 
and last, but by no means the least, 
it brings to him a taste of the pun
gent wine of excitement, and exhila
ration that comes just before the cur
tain rises.
Who can put into as many words 
the varying motions and sensations 
of him who stands in the joyous 
strains of the overture rising above 
the heavy murmur of the audience? 
while round him restlessly move 
his fellow players, some laughing and 
joking, some conversing in sibilant 
whispers, some going over their 
lines, for the last time, others of the 
chorus, in small groups, practicing 
steps and dances, while through the 
groups of players the grips, quiet 
and unconcerned, move swiftly and 
surely, following the deep-voiced 
orders of the stage manager. A low 
shrill whistle blows, the lights in 
borders and wings spring into life, 
the gloom of a moment ago is dis
pelled in the sudden blase of light, 
the stage is cleared in a twinkling 
and the dull gray mass of the cur
tain moves swiftly upward, greeted 
by the orchestra playing the opening 
chorus. What can equal the tense 
excitement of that moment?
Come back from the realm of fancy 
to everyday facts. The White 
Friars ARE going to play this year.
This is the fifth year in the life of 
the club and it is the intention of the 
Friars to make this years production 
the best, from every standpoint, that 
they have ever staged. Two years 
ago, during the rehearsals for 
Miss Mistaken, Coach Edmundson 
was constantly saying, Men, well 
make this show a hummer, but in 
our fifth year, well do the biggest 
(Continued on Page 5.)
THURSDAY MORNING 
LECTURE.
Dr. Thompson Talks on Student 
Problems.
The speaker at the general lecture 
hour last week was Dr. Thompson, 
President of Ohio State University, 
who, as introduced by Director Ham
erschlag, is prominent not only in 
the educational world, but in national 
politics as well. Dr. Thompson chose 
for his subject, The Value of Routine 
in Life, and showed how although 
the emergencies of life are the test 
put upon a man and his greatness is 
measured by meeting such emergen
cies, he must prepare himself for 
such crisis by constant application to 
routine work.
In spite of the fact that nowadays, 
competition seems to be the prevail
ing stimulus to success, it does not 
have the effect usually accorded to it; 
appreciation of the ability of others 
is coming to be a measure of genius. 
The more ready one man is to as
cribe to another worthy motives, the 
better citizen is the first.
There are two kinds of drudges: 
the one because he has to be, the 
other because he is sufficiently inter
ested in his work to want to be. If a 
man be keenly interested in the work 
before him, he must have complete 
dominion, be master of every detail, 
which requires constant application 
to routine work, and in this way only 
can he fit himself to master every 
situation. Discipline also is an ex
cellent thing for students, for al
though it usually seems hard to tie 
oneself down, the word discipline 
comes from disciple, which means 
simply a learner.
Dr. Thompsons speech, although 
abstract, was sincere and full of wise 
truths ably expressed, and the ap
preciation with which it was received 
by his audience was evinced by the 
close attention of the students and 
their hearty cheering at the close.

RULES OF CONDUCT.
Several sets of rules for the stu
dents of the A. I. school have recently 
been hung up in conspicuous places. 
The rules are in small neat frames, 
and present an attractive appearance. 
They are very concise, and are ap
proved by Dean Connelly, being for 
the most part elaborations of the fac
ulty rules. This shows that the upper 
men of the A. I. School are doing bus
iness, by giving no one any excuse 
for misconduct. If properly enforced, 
these rules will make the A. I. School 
a model school for conduct.
OUR ATHLETES WIN OFTEN.
The P. A. A. indoor meet, held 
last Saturday evening at Duquesne 
Gardens, was a great success from 
an athletic point of view. In regard 
to our own track team, the meet per
formed the main object for which 
men were entered,that of showing 
the coaches and the students just 
what may be expected for the main 
season. Only a few men competed 
under the name of the schools, but 
several others, who are barred from 
the team for a short time on account 
of deficiencies in studies, took part in 
the contests independently. These 
men may be counted on to be in good 
standing after Easter, and will then 
be eligible for the Varsity team.
A number of the best collegian ath
letes in the country took part in the 
meet, notably Thorpe of Carlisle, 
Burdick of Pennsylvania, Kikoff and 
Criswell of Ohio State, and Tewanima 
of Carlisle. All of these were stretch
ed to the limit of their ability to make 
the phenomenal showing that result
ed. In comparison to these, our ath
letes showed up remarkably well, 
which gives us reason to predict a 
season in which all local records will 
be touched or broken by Carnegie 
Tech athletes.
The best performance of the even
ing was in the high jump. Thorpe, 
of Carlisle, won at 6 feet 1 1-4 inches, 
with Burdick, of Penn, a close sec
ond.
Harry Murphy took third place for 
Carnegie Tech with a leap of 5 feet 
8 inches, which, with his handicap of
3 inches, credited him with 5 feet 11 
inches. J. A. Cronin, of the Varsity, 
also stayed in until the finish was 
near. This means the jumps will be 
well covered, as Murphy can better 
his record.
Capt. Boots ran as a novice in the 
60-yard dash of that class and won 
his trial heat, the semi-final heat and 
the finals, each in 7 1-5 seconds. This 
will add another good runner to our 
string of dash men. Kirk, formerly 
a student here, took second place, 
while Wilson, of Indiana, was third 
in the finals of this event.
In the 60-yard handicap, Boots 
qualified in the preliminary but drop
ped out of the semi-finals. The race 
was won by Thorpe in 6 4-5 seconds, 
while Hosey, running unattached 
was a close second. McDonald, of 
Hawley Prep, was third.
Chuck Crawford was our only 
entry in the 60-yard high hurdles. In 
his trial heat, he took second to Hammitt, of Mercersburg, and won over 
Haskins, unattached, in the semi-fin
als. These two men, headed by 
Thorpe, just nosed Crawford out of 
a place in the finals, 8 seconds being 
the winners time.

The cartoon appearing in this issue 
is one of a series submitted in com
petition for a prize offered by Mr. 
Hornbostel. Some of these drawings 
have been turned over to The Tartan 
for its use and will be run as often 
as space will allow.
THE MUSICAL CLUBS.
The Tartan desires to congratulate 
the directors, officers, and members 
of The Musical Clubs upon their 
splendid work. The concert on the 
evening of Thursday last was a de
cided success and has set a new mark 
in the achievements of this well man
aged organization, one which will 
prove hard to pass in the seasons* to 
come.
o
THE BULLETIN BOARDS.
The Tartan has long been tempted 
to make a few remarks concerning 
the condition of the various bulletin 
boards around the corridors. Plas
tered over with all sorts and condi
tions of notices, old and new, these 
boards are failing pretty much in 
serving their purpose. They create a 
poor impression upon any person en
tering buildings and The Tartan would 
like to see some step taken to rem
edy the situation. If it has been 
found impossible to leave the boards 
open and have them retain at least 
an air of respectability, then cover 
them with glass, as is now done with 
the Faculty boards. Let the commit
tees having charge of these boards 
have charge also of the notices put 
up, making somewhat more uniform 
in size, and see to it that where they 
have served their period of usefulness 
they are taken down. This would 
add to the appearance of the halls in
addition to being of material advan
tage to those desiring to announce 
anything via the bulletin boards.
o
THE WHITE FRIARS.
The White Friars are making a 
strenuous effort to get together once 
again and 'take their proper place in 
the life of the student-body. It is, 
of course, too early to predict the re
sult of their efforts as they have a 
very different task before them, one 
which will test their capacity to the 
utmost. We would not relish the idea 
of their failing since that would prob
ably mean their disappearance from 
the scene of action for all time. We 
do not believe that the student-body 
as a whole wants them to lose out 
and, if such is the case, it can very 
materially assist by taking an active 
interest in the affairs of the organiza
tion. In order to test the measure of 
support to be given them, The Friars 
have called for candidates for this 
evening, about which full information 
can be obtained in another part of 
this issue. Every member of the stu
dent-body who is interested in a dra
matic organization such as the Friars 
should attend this meeting, for it will 
necessarily be thought that failure to 
do so indicates lack of interest, and 
lack of student interest will mean 
death to the White Friars.
CONTRIBUTIONS.
There appeared in The Tartan of 
two weeks ago a contribution signed 
A Night Wiring Student. The Tar
tan was exceedingly glad to receive 
and publish such an article, since it 
believes that this is a means of gath
ering closer together the various ele
ments which go to make up the whole 
of this institution. Such articles give 
to the various student groups some 
idea of the thoughts of the other groups 
with which they may never come in 
contact. In this manner, The Tar
tan believes, it tends to promote and 
place upon a more solid basis that 
important factor in the life of any 
college, spirit. There is not enough 
of this interaction at Carnegie and, 
in the nature of things, it never can 
exist to the extent to which it does 
in other institutions. But it can and 
should exist to a greater extent than 
it now does, and one way of obtain
ing this is by the students making 
use of the columns of The Tartan as 
a go-between, expressing in them 
their thoughts, hopes and beliefs as 
to the various affairs of student in
terest. The Tartan stands ready to 
lend every assistance possible to such 
constructive work and trusts that the 
students will take advantage of this 
offer.
AS IT SHOULD BE.
In the issue of The Tartan of Feb
ruary 22nd, as editorial headed Stu
dent Behavior in Public, was pub
lished. In this article notice was 
taken of a clipping from the Wilmerding News-Tribune, which stated that 
a group of students from Carnegie 
Tech, while on a visit to that town, 
has seriously misbehaved themselves. 
The Tartan, upon receiving the clip
ping, investigated, as completely as 
the time before going to press would 
allow, the statements made in this 
article and was unable to connect 
them to any students from this insti
tution. Hence, it was stated that we 
are glad to say that we are unable 
to recognize any of the characters 
depicted therein. Now that the truth 
of the whole matter has come to light 
the Tartan desires to give to it the 
same publicity given to the mis
statements made in the first place by 
the News-Tribune.
The following letter was handed to 
The Tartan by Mr. Hepburn:
Wilmerding, Pa., Feb. 29th, 1912. To Whom It May Concern:With reference to the item appearing in the News-Tribune of recent date, concerning the visit of the Tech students to Wilmerding, will say, the item was not intended as a reflection upon the character of any of the students. It was zvritten by a personal friend of one of the students and was intended it should be taken as a joke, which we earnestly hope it has, and if it has been taken otherwise by some mislead source, we hope they will enlighten themselves on the subject and.set matters straight.News-Tribune Printing Co.It goes without saying that we are 
pleased to have this statement from 
the News-Tribune, proving as it does 
that there was no ground for the 
original article other than a poor at
tempt at a joke. That any outside 
person would read such an article as 
a joke we do not believe. There was 
nothing in the clipping we received 
to indicate that it was intended to be 
other than a description of events 
which had actually taken place. The 
Tartan is very glad to do what it can 
to set matters straight, but it can 
not but feel that it is up to The NewsTribune, since it originated this
joke, to explain to its readers the 
point, if there is such, and to give 
them a corrected impression of the 
students of this institution.

FOUNDWOODLAWN BABY.
Resultless, dreary and disappoint
ing has been the search for the evermissing Tech Baby. Fertile and 
short has been the quest for the 
Woodlawn Baby. In fact, there has 
been no quest at all. The message 
of the Babys arrival upon this world 
reached the Woodlawn Club quite un
expectedly. We regret being unable to 
publish its Christian name; the same 
has not been bestowed upon it yet. 
The Baby was born to Mrs. Meldrim 
Thompson and Buck Thompson, on 
Friday morning, March 8th. Buck 
is one of the Woodlawn Clubs old
est members. For the benefit of those 
concerned we may mention that ac
cording to the latest reports both 
mother and baby are doing well. It is 
a boy and weighs 8 1-2 lbs.

WHITE FRIARS TRYOUT.
The White Friars will hold a pre

in this years play in Room 104, Ap
plied Industries Building, Thursday, 
March 15, at 8 P. M.
Make a note of the time and the 
place, (and be there), for you may

Bear this in mind, you who have 
the interests of Carnegie at heart: 
the turnout of men for the White 
Friars preliminary tryout on next 
Thursday night will decide definitely 
once and for all, the fate of your 
only dramatic organiation. Should it 
be allowed to die, through your neg
ligence and neglect, it will be a 
smirch on the fair escutcheon of Car

years of time at that, can efface. If 
you cannot possibly attend this meet
ing in person, send your friends and 
companions, talk White Friar dope to 
your classmates, imbue them with 
the interest in the club that you your
self feelmake it a point of loyalty 
to Carnegie to send to that meeting 
men, and plenty of them, filled with 
enthusiasm and ardor for the work 
and the future of the Friars.

THE TARTAN3
(Continued from Page 1.)
A gratifying surprise was handed 
out to the track followers, when 
Happy Holiday took third place in 
the finals of the 440-yard run for nov
ices. Holliday is a liewcomer in this 
department of sports, but will be 
qualified to fill a place among the 
middle distance men who are needed.
The College Relay Race was one 
of the most exciting events of the 
evening. Pitt, W. & J., Indiana Nor
mal and Carnegie Tech were entered, 
but after the first half lap only the 
last two were in the race. Crawford 
started for us and got the lead at 
the turn, followed closely by Stull of 
Indiana. Bryson, Pitts best man, 
was left far in the rear with Wilson 
of W. & J. to keep him from being 
too lonely. Crawford ran his. two 
laps and half in great form, increas
ing his lead with almost every lap. 
He hugged the corners close, gaining 
time until he gave the race over to 
Wildberg. Wildberg ran a good race, 
but J. W. A. Brown, formerly a De
sign student, gained on him on the 
slippery turns and cut his lead in half. 
Sperry easily held his lead over White 
in a race that kept the spectators 
cheering. Frank Murphy was pitted 
against Lewis, the fastest quarter 
man on the Indiana team, and did his 
best to win the race for Tech. He 
held the lead until the last half lap, 
when, in taking the last turn, he slid 
towards the outside, which let his op
ponent pass him. Indiana won the 
race by a scant foot. The time was 
3:52, which was fast for the track. 
The last quarter was run faster than 
any of the other three, and Murphy 
deserved to win.
The five-mile run was interesting to 
all of the spectators. Bellars, of N. 
Y. A. C., and Arquette, of Carlisle, 
had a regular battle for leadership, 
but the former showed greater endur
ance and won in 25:25 3-5. Tewanima 
was third, being lapped twice by the 
winners.
The University Relay also drew 
wild excitement. Penn led off with 
a big start, but Cornell reduced the 
lead until the third man passed his 
opponest and allowed the last Cor
nell runner to win the race. Michi
gans last man sprained his ankle on 
the last lap and was barely able to 
hobble to the finish.
Some of our best men did not com
pete, which gives Coach Ramsdell the 
best of hopes for great success in 
later meets. Capt. Boots was also 
well pleased with the showing made 
by the men, especially those who are 
new in the game. Wagner, Knapp 
and Buck competed in the two-mile 
run and pluckily finished the dis
tance, although none of them were 
able to place against such stars as 
Criswell and Wickoff.
The next meet will be held at Wilkinsburg with the strong Westinghouse team on Saturday night, March 
23. The track in the Westinghouse 
gym is 16 1-2 laps to the mile. Men 
desiring to enter the following events 
should see Coach Ramsdell immedi

BIG INDUSTRY PLEBE MEET
ING.
On Wednesday, February 21, 1912, 
the Industries Plebes assembled for 
the purpose of electing class officers 
for the second term, and to decide 
other very important class matters. 
It was, beyond a doubt, the biggest 
and "most harmonious meeting ever 
held by the Plebes.
The meeting was opened as usual 
by chairman Voelker, and after the 
usual business was disposed of, the 
election of officers was held, with 
the following result:
PresidentVoelker.
Vice PresidentRandall.
Secretary and TreasurerWagner. 
Tartan Representative  Stewart 
was unanimously re-elected to the 
Tobie.
presidency. The Vice President 
hardly needs an introduction. Be it 
said in favor of the . Secretary and 
Treasurer, Honus that he is distant
ly related to the celebrity who 
bears his name. Much is expected 
from the new Tartan representative.
P. S.It has been suggested that 
Mr. Voelker watch that proverbial 
stump he usually carries since the 
new house rules are in force, lest he 
forget it, or he will be under the 
painful obligation of placing himself 
under arrest.

will to some extent remunerate him 
for his efforts.
The most striking feature of the 
second part of the program was the 
scener}r. The stage was rapidly 
transformed into a dormitory club 
room. A fire of electric lights was 
burning with a vivid red color. Arti
ficial flames were consuming big piles 
of wood. Many pennants decorated 
the wTalls. The inhabitants of the 
room wrere sitting on tables, chairs, 
and everything else available. For 
the edification of the audience a sign 
was let down which contained the 
following information: Scenery and
Asbestos Curtain by Withers and 
Smith Studios. The music of this 
part of the program was in harmony 
with the dormitory scene. The man
dolin club played Show Folks and 
Crocodile Isle, and the Glee Club 
sang Schneiders Band and Robin 
Adair. Special mention is due to the 
splendid solo sung by Skee Hodgdon. 
Mr. Hodgson has a soft, clear voice, 
especially adapted to My Sunshine 
Rose. The audience was satisfied 
only after he had sung the chorus 
over and over again. The last num
ber of the program was Alma 
Mater. The audience rose, but, 
though everybody was invited to join 
in the chorus, the participation could 
have been better and more general. 
There are still too many men in our 
institution that do not know the 
words of our most popular songs.
After the concert, the officers of 
the Musical Clubs were told by sev
eral prominent menamong whom 
were Pres. Thompson, of Ohio State, 
and several music criticsthat this 
was one of the best concerts, given 
by clubs of this character, that they 
had ever heard, and that our Musical 
Clubs will now take rank with any 
similar organization in the country. 
Considering the young age of our 
institution, this is no small achieve
ment, and it is to be hoped that the 
student body at large will understand 
and appreciate its meaning.
After the Concert, a dance was held 
at the Hotel Schenley, which lasted 
until 2:00. This feature of the even
ing was greatly enjoyed by all those 
present. The available room, how
ever, was hardly sufficient to accom
modate all the guests. We are in
formed that the management will 
next year take adequate measures to 
restrict the number of dance tickets 
issued.

among two hundred enthusiasts. Penn 
State will be met both in Pittsburgh 
and at State College, which means 
two good matches. One or two other

BASKETBALL LEAGUE.
What was probably the most in
teresting game of the league series 
was played on Tuesday of last week 
| when the two disputants for leader
ship clashed in personal contest. Xi 
Sigma Upsilon fraternity and the 
and the Faculty have been holding 
even pace since the tournament was 
inaugurated, but did not play against 
each other until last week. The fight 
was hot and fast, and even rough at 
times, with lots of noise from the two 
teams and their partisans. Dr. Marks 
refereed, but escaped with his life. 
The teams were well matched and at 
the close of time were tied at 6 to 
6. Play was continued for seven 
minutes, Gay shooting the decid
ing field goal for XI Sigma Upsilon.
Gamma Kappa featured by win
ning two games on the same day. 
Design went down to defeat 22 to 6, 
and Industries were also beaten 23 
to 5.
Xi Sigma Upsilon triumphed over

GLEE CLUB OFFICERS FOR 
1912-13.
Last Sunday afternoon, at the an
nual election of officers the members 
of the Musical Clubs elected the fol
lowing men to hold office next sea
son:
PresidentR. M. Crawford.
ManagerH. A. Warne.
Business ManagerA. E. Hamilton. 
Publicity ManagerL. E. Griswold. 
Stage ManagerH. L. Cornwall. 
Secretary and Treas.F. H. Haaren. 
Glee Club Lbr.E. G. Lebman. 
Mandolin Club Lbr.E. D. Lambert. 
The election has been early this year 
so that the new officers may start 
immediately on the bookings and bus
iness of next season. This insures 
better and more engagements and 
also the spreading of the work over 
a long period of time.
For the officers this season has been 
one of the most difficult in the his
tory of the clubs. Much credit is 
due them all and in particular, Messrs. 
Button, Madison and Warne, for 
pulling the clubs through this Home 
Concert Season in such royal fash
ion.

CRUCIBLE CLUB MEETING.
A rather poorly attended meeting 
of the Crucible Club was held in Room 
218 last Friday evening, March 8th. 
Mr. Griswold, of the Department of 
Mining, told his experiences as a 
government land claim appraiser of 
forest reservations in Colorado. Mr. 
Griswold is a very interesting speaker 
and held the undivided attention of 
his hearers as he spoke about the 
methods of getting around forest reg
ulations by the westerners and the 
trouble he had in preventing claim
ants from salting the ore mines 
which he was appraising. He gave 
the club members present a very 
vivid idea of the western forest con
ditions and the class of people who 
live there. The members who were 
absent missed one of the best talks 
ever given before the Crucible Club.
After the talk the meeting adjourn
ed to the Crucible Club room and 
refreshments were served by the 
eats committee. Mr. Griswold an
swered questions here, and told of 
many little incidents that had oc
curred to him in the west.

BASEBALL SQUAD WORKING.
Do you want to see the real Car

tions? If you do come to the gym 
and see the baseball squad working 
out. Three times a weekMonday, 
4-5, Wednesday, 4-5, and Saturday, 
2-5the pluckiest, busiest, brainiest 
bunch of ball players ever gathered 
together under the Tech standard, 
are working their heads off to make 
the varsity.
The pitching staff consists of about 
a dozen men, among whom are sev
eral experienced men. No trouble 
is expected in developing three or 
four hurlers of varsity caliber.
The outfield promises to be the 
best batting and fielding combination 
Tech ever had. The infielders and 
catchers show so much ginger that it 
is a toss up as to who will get the 
jobs.
A strong schedule for the second 
team is being arranged, with high 
and prep schools. This will mean 
that many men who do not round 
into form in the first part of the 
season will take advantage of prac
tice offered by the second teams 
schedule and use it as a stepping 
stone to the varsity.
It is expected to have two almost 
equally good men for each position. 
In that case accidents, sickness and 
probation would be forestalled.

6THE TARTAN
SENIOR FAVORITES.
After spending four years within 
the walls of this institution, the opin
ions of the graduates of the differ
ent schools are widely sought, and 
indeed are of considerable value 
maybe. As is customary each year, 
a vote is taken by the Senior Classes 
to determine in just what manner dif
ferent individuals, and objects have 
contributed to their success, and what 
their personal opinion of certain in
dividuals might be, particularly mem
bers of the faculty.
Meetings will be held by the vari
ous senior classes during the follow
ing week to vote on these matters 
of importance, and it is hoped that 
the results may be published two 
weeks from this date.

THISTLE NEWS.
The Thistle Board held their last 
business meeting on Wednesday, 
March 6,. Another meeting will be 
held the first Wednesday after The 
Thistle appears to review and criti
cize the work.
It may be interesting to note that 
just fifteen meetings were held from 
December 6 to March 6, at which the 
average attendance was 17. Exclud
ing three meetings at which roll was 
called for the Staff only, the aver
age attendance is raised to 19. This 
meant an average attendance of 80 
per cent of the Board.
If the photographer, engraver and 
printer continue to make the progress 
they have already made the possi
bilities for the appearance of The 
Thistle on April 8th will be very 
good. However, unforseen, circum
stances may upset all plans, so that 
at the present time no promises can 
be made.---------------o---------------

M. M. C. S. ALUMNAE NEWS.
The Alumnae Association of the 
M. M. C. S. is in receipt of a letter 
from a member, Miss Kitty McMul
len, Secretarial, 09, who is now a 
missionary in Tunghiang, China. 
Coming from the country which is 
the scene of the most remarkable po
litical and social revolution in mod
ern history, the letter is of peculiar 
interest.
Writing on the 13th of January, of 
the question in which the whole 
world is interestedthat of the ren
aissance in ChinaMiss McMullen 
says, We who are living here are 
thrilled because of the wonderful way 
slow China has shown the world the 
fulfillment of the prophecy, A na
tion shall be born in a day. It is 
indeed wonderful to watch the effect 
it is having on people of every class 
even in such places as small and in
significant as Tunghiang. We have a 
population of about 20,000 and it is 
a walled city, but like hundreds of 
others around of no importance as a 
a city. All the towns and cities of 
this part of China are under the new 
flag and new government and we all 
find it much more satisfactory than 
formerly. Personally, I do not be
lieve China is ready for a Republic, 
but as all the people want it I beelieve it is the only solution of the j 
problem. Yuan Shih Kai is not trust- I 
ed by the people and all adore Sun 
Yat Sen.
Mi ss McMullen says that the 
most noticeable result is the 
queue-cutting. There is always 
great fun when a queue comes 
off, and the self - consciousness 
of the minus-quantity is most laugh- j 
able. You wrill see the most remark
able hats, supposed to be foreign, on 
the heads of all.
Another result of the revolution 
which is apparent is the passing of 
the old social order which held the 
women as slaves and in seclusion. 
Miss McMullen speaks with misgivngs of the dash for liberty which 
the Chinese women are making and of 
the foothold the English suffragettes 
are gaining with them, but finds sol
ace in what she sees being done by 
women led by more conservative 
teachers, and describes a joint meet
ing of two societies recently organ
ized and representing women in every 
class and relation in life in Tung
hiang. One societythe Anti-cigar
ettehas practically put a stop to 
the selling of cigarettes here; the 
other societyMothers Improve
mentdiscusses such subjects as, 
The importance of careful selection 
of the friends of children, The care 
of the eyes, papers on Chinas he
roes, etc.
M iss McMullen finds the language 
very difficult and is spending from 
six to eight hours a day in study of 
it, but she does it gladly in her eager
ness to help the Chinese girls to look 
at life from a higher planeOh! how 
I long for the time when I can talk 
and give to them what has already 
been given to me.
The letter is very interesting in ap
pearance as it is written on Chinese 
letter paper, and is, by actual meas
urement, two and one-half yards long. 
Further extracts from it will appear 
in the Alumni Number.
---------------o---------------
A STEP FORWARD.
For the past two weeks consider
able comment has been heard about 
! the individual towels now used in all 
the schools, and this has naturally 
aroused the question, When will in
dividual drinking cups be installed? 
Too much cannot be said regard
ing the common drinking cup as a 
spreader of disease, and altho the 
Pennsylvania State Legislature has 
j not followed the example of many 
other progressive states in the enac
tion of a law to prohibit the use of 
the drinking cup in public places, it 
is to be hoped that this will soon be 
taken up and passed.
While some students in the schools 
apparently do not appreciate the ex
pense and efforts of the school au
thorities to do what is best, ninety 
per cent do appreciate and are will
ing to co-operate with the schools in 
the establishment of such protections 
for the student health.
It is to be hoped that announce
ment can soon be made concerning 
! the establishment of the individual 
! drinking cups in all the schools.

FACULTY WINS FROM 
CRIPPLES.
Before a small, but fanatic, crowd 
the crack Faculty five defeated the 
Varsity on Friday evening, March 8, 
by a score of 40 to 22. The game was 
a stiff one for a crippled team tailing 
out a hard season, opposed to former 
college stars who had played only 
enough to keep in condition. This 
was shown when Colvin came into 
violent contact with Lightner, as the 
latter checked the Varsity center in 
a run down the floor. Colvin was 
carried from the floor and remained 
out for the remainder of the contest, 
nursing numerous painful bruises.
In spite of the final score, the 
greater part of the game was as close 
as such a contest could be. Until the 
last ten minutes, the Varsity kept 
their opponents lead under six points. 
Then with the score 24 to 20, the 
Faculty struck a winning streak and 
ran up 16 points in less than that num
ber of minutes.
Marks, McCulloch and Lightner 
were the heavy scorers of the game, 
while Ramsdell starred in guarding. 
Yahres and Capt. Williams played in 
manners that far overtopped their 
weights. Kesselman kept the score 
low by his sensational guarding.

DIRECTORS.
Little has been said but much done 
by the Directors during the past 
two weeks. This is a strange fact as 
almost everybody in the Civil Depart
ment had been anxiously awaiting the 
results of the meeting held during 
the past week. When the news came 
out of the doings and achievements 
of Tabler, aided somewhat by.Stubly, 
it was immediately decided to hold a 
grand banquet in honor of Tabler, no 
expense to be spared to make the af
fair the best ever. The banquet was 
held during the latter part of last 
week at one of the citys best Bean
eries. The most notable event of 
the banquet was the after-dinner 
speech of Tabler himself, who mod
estly described how he had accom
plished what heretofore had been con
sidered impossible. As the result of 
Tablers work success looms in the 
foreground for the Directors as an 
institution.

THE TARTAN7
PENNSYLVANIAS RELAY 
RACES TO BE BIGGER 
AND BETTER THAN EVER.
With seventy colleges, over 150 
schools, 1600 contestants, broken rec
ords in two Americal college cham
pionship relay races, and new figures 
in both the high school and the pre
paratory school American champion
ship relays, with records approached 
in every one of the special events, 
and a very high standard in both col
legiate and scholastic relay races, it 
was thought that last seasons Relay 
Races had reached the very apex of 
athletic endeavor. But this years 
races to be held on April 27th prom
ise to be bigger and better than ever. 
Already all the big colleges, with 
hardly an exception, of both the East 
and the West, have entered their 
teams, and some wonderful perform
ances may be looked for in the col
lege relay championships of America 
and in the special events. In the lat
ter will be found such men as Law
rence, of Harvard, who recently 
cleared 6 ft. 4 1-2 inches in the high 
jump; Thorpe, the great Carlisle In
dian athlete, with records of 15 3-5 
sed for the high hurdle, 6 ft. 1 in. for 
the high jump, 23 ft. 4 in. for the 
broad jump, 45 ft. for the shot-put, 
avid 10 sec. for the hundred; Babcock, 
of Columbia, who won the intercol
legiate pole-vault championship at 12 
ft. 8 3-8 in.; Tilley ,of Dartmouth, the 
Intercollegiate hammer-throw cham
pion; Burdick, of Pennsylvania, the 
high-jump champion;Wasson of Notre 
Dame, the Western 100 yds. cham
pion; Wilson, of Coe College, 
the Western 220-yards cham
pion; Edwards, of Pennsylvania, joint 
holder with Kraenzlein of the highhurdle record at 15 1-5 sec.; and many 
other men of great ability.
This is Olympic Year, and all the 
college athletes are out to do their 
best. In the one-, two-, and four-mile 
college championships, many of the 
greatest runners in America are ex
pected to appear, as Michigan, Yale, 
Harvard, Princeton, Pennsylvania, 
Chicago, etc., have already entered, 
and all the other big colleges are ex
pected to do so.
At present writing (March 1st) 
nearly 200 teams have entered, so that 
it is a surety that April 27th will see 
another record-breaking meet on 
Franklin Field. Pennsylvanias Relay 
Races are known all over the world as 
not only one of the biggest set of 
scholastic and collegiate sports, but 
also as one of the highest-class set of 
games of the year.

COLLAPSE OF A REINFORCED 
CONCRETE BUILDING, AT 
ETNA, PA.
H. R. Thayer.
There has been a remarkable 
growth in reinforced concrete con
struction in recent years. Two de
cades ago this method of building 
was somewhat of a curiosity; today 
it is a recognized standard and is fast 
displacing brick and stone masonry. 
One factor which has helped this 
progress is the cheap labor employed 
in laying concrete, while brick and 
stone masons receive wages which 
are attractive to intelligent men. This 
seems strange when we recollect that 
stone and brick have been used for 
many centuries and their properties 
are so well known that a common 
workman would recognize a poorly 
laid wall. Moreover, they carry only 
direct compression, a force which is 
easily analyzed.
With reinforced concrete the case 
is different. Intelligent design de
mands perhaps more of the higher 
mathematics than any other material. 
Furthermore, the concrete itself will 
vary with the quality of the cement, 
sand, and stone and amount of water; 
also with the thoroughness of the 
mix, the age, and many other condi
tions. When properly used, it gives 
us an ideal building for many pur
poses; fireproof, strong, and durable. 
But great care and skill are necessary 
to attain these ends.
Among the many rules which 
should be observed are the following: 
Concrete must never be laid when the 
thermometer registers below 10 de
grees F; between 10 degrees and 32 
degrees, sand stone, and water, or at 
least one of these are to be heated 
and the whole protected against freez
ing weather until it has thoroughly 
set.
Just how the freezing affects con
crete, is not definitely known. Prob
ably, it prevents that chemical union 
bttween the water and the cement 
which recreates the solid rock from 
which it was calcined.
For some time it has been noticed 
that a long cold spell followed by 
warm weather coincided with the fall 
of some partially completed build
ings. So when I heard of the failure 
at Etna last week, I decided to look 
it over myself. With three interest
ed Seniors, I made the trip last Tues
day (the 20th). Etna is some dis
tance away when covered by our 
street railway service. As our sched
ule gave us only three hours for jour
ney and dinner, we had only an hour 
at the site.
The contractors for the SpangChalfant Co. were just finishing a 
building several hundred feet long, 
about 100 feet wide, and 3^ stories 
high. Some 80 feet of this at one 
end had fallen down. Here we found 
window frames, reinforcing rods, cin
ders, and concrete mixed in confu
sion. The scene of the disaster was 
roped off but I selected an outlying 
piece of concrete that looked rather 
poor and kicked it to pieces. How
ever forms were still in evidence and 
this piece may have been a part of the 
construction which was still stored
up. Portions seemed fairly strong 
but there was enough poor stuff to 
have been the cause to the trouble. 
A bystander said that everything that 
was laid during the recent cold 
weather, fell.
From what I could learn, the first 
failure was in the 12"xl4" concrete 
columns which supported the roof. 
These carried about 23" of cinders 
and about 8" of concrete, a total of 
about 250 pounds per square foot. 
Columns were spaced 20 feet one way 
and 25 the other, hence total load was 
125,000 pounds and unit stress some
thing like 750 pounds per square inch.
The 20-foot roof which carried this 
load was arched with 4" depth at the 
crown and 10" at the springing line. 
It was reinforced by -HT'x^" deformed 
bars. This should not be figured as 
an arch because we saw no provision 
for carrying thrust. 23 inches of cin
ders and 4 inches of concrete make 
200 pounds per square foot dead load, 
an unnecessarily heavy load and one 
which must have tried the arch very 
severely.
It must be remembered that I am 
depending almost entirely on verbal 
information and my own memory. 
Ones observations in a tangled mass 
of wreckage are also likely to be at 
fault. But unless some such mistake 
has been made, we find little cause 
for wonder in the unfortunate collapse 
of this building.

MARCH MEETING OF M. M. C. S.
The letter from Miss McMul
len was read in its entirety 
at the Associations March Tea, 
while the members and their 
guests drank of the most polite tea 
in China (sent by Miss McMullen) 
and tasted the Chinese cakecandyeffect.
The health of the Tech Baby was 
proposed.
Miss Helen Baglin sang exquisite
ly, Miss Charlotte Schaffner playing 
her accompaniments. Cross-stitch 
and other needlework lay unreguarded 
as the girls listened to their most be
loved musicians. Miss Baglins 
group of songs included:
Expectancy ........................La Forge
Primavera........Mary Turner Salter
Will O the Wisp----Joseph Scronn
The Island Where Babies Grow
........................................................ Ford
Miss West gave a spirited resume 
of an interesting conversation she 
had had recently with Dr. Humea 
great authority on the subject of the 
Chinesein the course of which he 
had stated that China and the Chi
nese woman are in readiness for the 
order of th new dayready for lib
erty. Honorary Members present 
were: Dean West, Miss Williams,
Miss Bradt and Miss Bray. Miss 
Jean Herron, Vice President, pre
sided. She was assisted by Misses 
Fannie Woodside, Ethelwyn Dodson, 
Mary Craighead, and Frances Ray
burn.
Miss Harriet H. Ellis, 09, writes 
from her bungalow and tea room, 
The Hitching Post, at Dodge, Geor
gia, that business has been brisk ever 
since Christmas.
For awhile she had no companion 
assistantand then followed three 
weeks when they had a heavy rush 
of business. In one week they served 
ninety-three meals. The extremely 
cold weather of this winter in the 
South caused some funny experiences, 
she reports. For instance, to make 
a cake the egg whites had to be chip
ped and warmed on the stovethen 
chilled before they could be beaten. 
At night everything froze perfectly 
stifftops burst off various bottles, 
giving them a regular fusillade.
Socially she is having quite a won
derful time principally with the army 
people. There is an army post at 
Dodge.

8T H E TARTAN
 WHATS WHAT AND HOW. j
The catalog, that educational Baedecker, that justly celebrated contri
bution to contemporaneous literature, 
deserving its place in the steerage 
(misprint for peerage) of best sell
ers, as it undoubtedly does, has inaccountably sprunk a leak. It makes no 
mention of the popular course offered 
by the ever venerated Terpsichore, 
and recorded in the apochryphal ap
pendix of the schedule. After the 
manner of appendices the world over, 
this is a sensitive and somewhat iras
cible if obscure portion of the schedulic anatomy, resulting in chronic but 
not fatal attacks of appendicitis, yield
ing only to the absent treatment, of 
which the Deans offices make a spe
cialty.
The hours appropriated by this un
printed portion of the schedule are 
any of the 24 not pre-empted by that 
celebrated document itself, prefer
ably those dedicated to morpheus by 
the sleep sodden proletariat. In these 
gladsome hours, winged by the witch
ing presence of the heavenly maid, 
not mangled and hobbled by the rau
cous and impertinent cackle of the 
gong, the erstwhile wilted toiler in 
the educational vineyard sloughs off 
his lethargy, as the insect pupa does 
its cocoon, and for the time being 
imagines himself a butterfly, even if 
he does look like something quite 
different which shall be nameless 
here.
Then does he, with incredible en
thusiasm and perseverance trip over 
his own light fantastic toe, and with 
indifferent success endeavor to keep 
off the 1. f. t. of his partner at least 
a portion of the time.
It is, after all, an inestimable privi
lege to pay your $10 to $20 out of 
the princely income over which most 
students preside, for the gilded oppor
tunity to tread with impunity on each 
others corns until the magic hour of
4 a. m., and subsequently (quite sub
sequently in fact) at 7 a. m. be ex
cavated from your downy couch with 
the aid of a steam shovel, to gorge 
yourself on a glass of water, because 
forsooth your twinkling(?) feet cost 
so much per twinkle, that your stom
ach will have little to do but twinkle 
for a week or so until you get within 
megaphone distance of your income. 
And then, too, the morning after, you 
are so inundated with longing for 
sweet engineering converse with your 
instructors that you arrive at the 
place of execution ten minutes early 
not.
It is curious isnt it? how this pas
sion for hopping around to music 
growrs on us, we didnt, any of us, 
show any marked keenness for it, 
when we took our first lessons in the 
wood shed, stimulated as we were, 
too, by the blithesome chords evoked 
from a resonant shingle by the pater
nal virtuoso.
The highly desirable loss of sleep 
which adds such a charm to our maturer performances in this line, was 
not altogether absent from these early 
ceremonies either. For there never 
seemed to be a good place in the bed 
to put that portion of our anatomy 
that always took the conspicuous role
in the preceding festivities.
That this beneficent exercise should 
add an indisputable element to en
gineering education we cannot for a 
moment doubt. An inability to exe
cute (execute is the word) the Bos
ton or to assassinate Paul Jones, 
would fill a prospective employer of 
engineers with disgust.
And then, too, it is always a pious 
tribute to our ancestors. Some of 
these are so remote that family rec
ords do not reach them, but we know 
they must have danced. All simple, 
untutored, untailored, unwashed prim
itive souls loved it; love it yet. And 
they retained this advantage over our 
enlightened rehearsals; the expense 
was trifling. A fat dog or two, easily 
accessible to an agile committee; no 
temporary or permanent complica
tions with a dress suit; no carriages; 
no tips to waiters except those read
ily bestowed with a club; no patent 
leather chamber of horrors on their 
feet. Nothing in fact to curb their 
effervescing spirits except an ex
haustion in the supply of effervescing 
spirits, and that could always be com
pensated by a free for all scrap. This 
touching impressionist sketch is of
fered as a tacit suggestion to the salt
atory descendents of these hardy pio9UREAU FOR STUDENT AID

CARNEGIE TECHNICAL SCHOOLS : PITTSBURGH
T
HE Carnegie Technical Schools consist of four 
separate schools, each with its own faculty, buildings 
and student body. The courses of instruction 
offered in these four schools differ widely.
School of Applied ScienceOffers courses in chemical, 
civil, electrical, commercial, mechanical, metallurgical, 
mining and sanitary engineering.
School of Applied DesignOffers courses in architecture, 
interior decoration, illustration and painting, open to both 
men and women.
School of Applied IndustriesOffers industrial courses in 
machine construction, building construction, and elec
trical equipment and installation. Short courses are offered 
in the various trades for applicants with experience. A 
new course to equip men as teachers in manual training 
and in trade school work is also offered. The increasing 
demand for such men provides an attractive field for the 
progressive young mechanic and the public school teacher
Margaret Morrison Carnegie SchoolFor women only. 
Offers courses in household economics, secretarial work, 
dressmaking, and costume illustration and design. Be
cause of the demand for trained teachers, graduate courses 
are offered for those who wish to prepare for the many 
positions now open for women in these newer lines of work.
Night CoursesThe four schools offer night courses in 
practically all of the above subjects to provide educational 
opportunities for those who are at work during the day.
