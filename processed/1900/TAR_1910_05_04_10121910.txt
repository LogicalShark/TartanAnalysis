VOL. V PITTSBURGH, PA., WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 12, 1910 No. 4
APPLIED INDUSTRIES CLASS FIGHT
On Friday, October 7, the first and second year 
classes of the School of Applied Industries held their 
annual fight on the school athletic field. The schedule 
of events included a football game, wrestling 
matches, a tug-of-war, a relay race, and a sack rush. 
When the dust had cleared away the score stood a tie, 
14x/214%. The second year men were in the lead 
until the last event, the sack rush. In this, both 
classes were rather hazy as to the end they were sup
posed to accomplish and after it was over it seemed 
as though it would have to be repeated. However, 
the officials finally awarded the event to the new men 
and everybody, except the second year men, went 
home happy.
The stands were well filled with interested specta
tors. The bright costumes of the crowd of Margaret 
Morrison girls who occupied the right of the grand
stand added a note of cheerfulness to the gala day.
The contestants were led onto the field by the 
Tech band. After marching around the field several 
times the band took its place in the stands where it 
rendered soul-stirring selections throughout the af
ternoon. The two classes took their places on the 
field and the scrap was on.
The first event was a football game between picked 
teams from the two classes. Owing to the fact that 
the teams were assembled but an hour before the 
game, the contest was one of many errors and laugh
able mistakes. The referee was lenient, however, 
and everything was allowed except slugging. From a 
spectators standpoint the game was funny, from the 
students standpoint it was exciting. So what did it 
matter if the new rules were slighted? To one versed 
in the game, the contest resembled a small-sized 
cyclone of rushing bodies, scurrying back and forth
over the field. Offside plays were as numerous as 
Plebe flunk-outs in January and Referee McCulloch 
and Umpire Dosey were kept busy pulling the players 
off each other.
The features of the first quarter were a 25-yard run 
by Bucks and an attempted field goal from the 30- 
yard line by the same player. Most of the playing 
during this period occurred in the center of the geld.
In the second quarter Rogers created some excite
ment by stopping the play on account of an injury 
sustained by the sole of his shoe. Head Linesman 
Traver acted as surgeon and amputated the injured 
member, Rogers very bravely going back into the 
game. Lutton, a second year man did some excellent 
tackling during the first and second quarters.
During the intermission Linesman Traver was 
again the center of interest when he punted his shoe 
the phenomenal distance of 20 yards. Both classes 
put in new teams for the last two quarters. Pidge 
Woods attempted to demonstrate his pet theory that 
tennis is a liberal education in all sports by playing 
quarter for the yearlings. The second year men 
had a slight advantage during the last half. Later 
in the third quarter a long run by Heisel and some 
good line plunging by full back, Connelly carried the 
ball to the first year mens 3-yard line only to lose it 
on downs. The up-starts were never able to get the 
ball out of their territory after that, but as the upper 
classmen were also unable to score, the five points 
that the game counted were divided evenly.
The wrestling matches took place next. Physical 
Director McColloch acted as referee and decreed that 
strangle holds,. hammer locks and full-nelsons were 
barred. In the light weight bout, Conway, second 
year, lost to Cossitt by two straight falls. In the

---------------------------------------------------

4THE TARTAN
middle weight contest, Lose, first year, won from 
Huber, second year, by one fall and two draws. These 
two men were by far the most evenly matched of 
all the wrestlers. The heavy weights, Wallace, sec
ond year, and Randolf, first year, completed the pro
gram. The freshmen also won this bout on a tie and 
two falls. These three matches gave the new men 
five more points.
The big rope for the tug-of-war was then brought 
upon the field. Forty picked men from each class 
were lined up along it. The first year men gained one 
yard at the jump, but after that they lost ground 
steadily until the upper-classmen were declared win
ners. This counted five points. Both classes then 
prepared for the relay race. This was by far the 
most interesting and laughable event of the day. 
Thirty men from each class participated. Fifteen 
yearlings and an equal number of first year men 
were stationed at each end of the foot ball field. One 
man from each class was given a handkerchief. They 
raced to the other end and there delivered the token 
to two other runners, who carried it back. This was 
continued until each man had run the length of the 
field. Frequently the waiting man failed to catch 
the handkerchief from the hand of the runner as he 
plunged by, and so had to lose time making a frantic 
dive to get it. The pairing of the runners also afford
ed much laughter and amusement. The tall and the 
short; the fat and the lean; the graceful and the 
awkward, were all there; and usually they were 
paired off in such a way as to show the greatest con
trast. All manners and styles of running were on 
exhibition. Some ran well, while another seemed to 
find difficulty in keeping their feet from gyrating into 
every direction. Pidge Woods classy stepping and 
head motion were especially admired by the on
lookers. The two-year-olds finally won this event 
by one length of the field, thereby scoring seven 
points for their class.
The sack rush put the finishing touch to the day. 
A sack filled with cinders was placed at each end 
of the field. The classes lined up opposite each other. 
The object of the game was to see which class could 
first run the length of the field, pick up the sack and 
carry it back to the center. At first it seemed as 
though the new men would win easily, but some one 
broke through their interference and downed the 
man with the sack on the 52-yard line. In the mean
time, Dornberger, by an exciting run, brought the 
other sack to the 48-yard line before being tackled. 
This gave the event to the first year men by a very 
small margin, but sufficient to add seven points to 
their score. Then, after a mutual compliment of 
cheers the two classes marched off the field with the 
question of supremacy still undecided.
During the contests, Director Hamerschlag and Su
pervisor of Athletics Savage sat together in the grand
stand and derived much amusement from the antics 
of the rampant students. Quite a number of the Car
negie Tech faculty were in attendance, while many ,a 
fond parent gazed eagerly or anxiously at his young 
hopeful on the field of conflict. The day was the 
most successful ever given by the Industries school
and the men who arranged it deserve great credit for 
the manner in which things were conducted.

PENN STATE 61TECH 0.
One of the worst defeats ever sustained by a Car
negie' Tech football team was administered last Sat
urday when the Plaid fell before the onslaughts of 
the heavy Penn State team. The State team out
weighed the light Tech aggregation to the man, the 
lightest man in the State line-up tipping the team at 
more than Techs heaviest player. In spite of the 
fact that quite a number of our boys had never be
fore played against a really big college team, the 
Carnegieites put up a scrappy, gritty struggle. How 
ever, their efforts were hopeless against the superior 
weight and science of the Center county bunch.
Although as a team the Tech men showed up poor
ly, several of our players shone individually. Dyer 
again did some great tackling, his work being one of 
the features of the game. When he was taken out 
and Schmucker substituted in his place, the latter 
commanded attention by his exceptionally good punt
ing. At one time after State had scored a safety, 
Schumcher kicked out for a distance of fifty-five 
yards. Hatcher and Baume also played well and to 
Reds example may be attributed to a large degree 
the fighting spirit displayed by the new men through
out the game.
State scored 46 points during the first two quarters, 
but in the second half Techs light team braced and 
only 15 more were counted. During this period the 
men tackled much harder and with greater accuracy. 
Their temporary nervousness wore off and they be
gan to play something like Tech football. Through
out the game the Tech team was unable to gain 
a single first down, States heavy line and backs 
effectually smashing all interference, giving the ends 
every chance to get the man.
Tech was very fortunate to come out of the con
test with so few injured men. Dyer, at the end of 
the first quarter, and Hull, at the end of the second, 
were the only men for whom substitutes were sent 
into the game. In both cases, the injuries were slight. 
State, on the contrary, sent in fresh men at all stages 
of the game.
For the Center County team, Barrett, Very and Mil
ler made several sensational end runs. In addition to 
this, Barrett scored States seventh touchdown by a 
brilliant dash for almost the length of the field. He 
secured the ball on the kick-off and, aided by an im
pregnable intereference, swept through the entire

Tech team. This was the. most spectacular play of 
the day. .Mauthe, Engle and Quirk also gained well, 
frequently skirting the tackles .for runs of from ten to 
forty yards.
State worked every trick in her repertoire, includ
ing forward passes and onside kicks. The light Tech 
team appeared unable to stay them, although their 
playing at all times was fast and gritty. Even though 
overwhelmed they seized every chance .to hold down 
the score. Schmucher saved three points at least by 
recovering a blocked punt behind the goal line. This 
scored a safety but prevented a touchdown] State 
scored in all possible ways, securing ten touch downs, 
six goals from touchdowns, one goal from the field 
by Mauthe, and a safety. The line-up:

WHITE FRIARS.
One of the most important movements of the last 
week occurred when the White Friars Dramatic Club 
of Carnegie Tech met in the auditorium of the Ap
plied Industries Building, Wednesday evening, Oc
tober 5th. It was the first meeting of the year and 
thirty members of the club attended. Promptly at 
8:00 oclock, the meeting was called to order by 
Temporary Chairman Steen, who was elected to hold 
that position in the absence of the president and vicepresidents. By general request, Mr. Steen gave a 
brief talk outlining the idea and aim of the club and 
explaining the constitution to the new members. Im
mediately following Mr. Steens address, Mr. W. B. 
Edmundson, last years coach and playwright, re
sponded to the popular demand and spoke to the 
men assembled. His speech took the form of a re
view of last seasons work and an earnest plea for the
same interest and intentness toward this year's pro
duction. He showed, with simple directness, the 
great strides which have been made by the Friars in 
the past, the obstacles which have been overcome 
and the triumphs which have resulted. He prophesied 
that, if the Friars keep progressing as fast in the 
future as they have in the past, the time is not far 
distant when Carnegie Tech will stand foremost in 
the world of college theatricals. Enthusiastic ap
plause followed his address.
The election of officers was then called for by the 
chairman. By unanimous vote, Alan Bright, 11 was 
elected President of the club for the year 1910-11. 
The other officers were chosen as follows:
First Vice President.................................C. E. Moss, 12
Second Vice President...........................H. P. Smith, 13
Treasurer...............................................J. K. Lamoree, 12
Secretary............................................D. D. Mitchell, 12
Business Manager..............................C. M. Crawford, 13
Board of Governors(Graduate Members) Steen 08,
Rodgers, Somers, (Undergraduate Members) J.
B. Hays, 12, D. D. Mitchell, 12.
Three ballots were necessary before the Board of 
Governors was finally selected. The secretary, ac
cording to the club constitution was elected by the 
Board.
In the absence of President-elect Bright, Vice Presi
dent Moss then took charge of the meeting. A resolu
tion was passed, asking Mr. Edmundson and Mr. Dorrington to again take charge of the years production 
in their respective capacities of coach and musical 
director. The gentlemen named signified their will
ingness to serve the Friars once more, thus assuring 
Tech another dramatic success. A motion was then 
passed allowing Mr. Edmundson to choose an as
sistant. The coach announced Mr. Oscar Bieler as 
his selection, to the satisfaction of everyone. Mr. 
Bieler helped to train the dancing-chorus last year 
and proved invaluable in the work.
A general discussion of the prospects for this sea
son followed the business meeting. Extensive plans 
are on foot and the Friars expect to put on the best 
show in its career. Several good trips are in view. 
Akron, Johnstown, East Liverpool, Atloona and New 
Castle have all sent letters asking that the White 
Friars visit them. This year, all dates for out-of-town 
appearances will be closed before rehearsals for the 
play commence. The trips will probably be taken 
before the Pittsburgh production and the people of 
this city will have the opportunity of seeing a sea
soned, well-drilled troupe of college-players in ac
tion. The club will also have its own quarters this 
year, according to present indications, and no stone 
will be left unturned to make this the most success
ful season in the history of Carnegie Tech.
Soph and Freshman Medics at Vanderbilt Universi
ty have signed a pledge never again to indulge in the 
pleasant sport of hazing. Recent sprouts parties 
held by the classes led to this step.

STEPS TO SUCCESS.
The Carnegie Tech football team has played two 
games this season. The first game was a tie, the 
second an overwhelming loss for the Plaid. The re
sults obtained by the early season efforts of our 
team are not what we hoped for; in a measure, they 
are not what we expected. Are we dismayed? The 
question is superfluous. We are not.
A wise old sage once said, Failures are but step
ping-stones to success. He had the right spirit, the 
spirit which wins in the end, no matter how dark 
the outlook may seem. Many have been the dis
appointments and many the trials that have been 
faced by the man who has climbed; great has been 
the anguish and deep the despair that has faced the 
successful one in those dark hours which must come 
before the final goal is reached; but far greater and 
far, far stronger has been the fortitude and hope
fulness which has followed every set-back, until, by 
the very strength of his failures, he has succeeded. 
Football is much the same.
Conditions at Tech this year are anything but fa
vorable for big football. The arrangement of the 
schedule, the great amount of time which must be 
given to study (a necessary but unpleasant fact 
which is co-incident with a technical train
ing), lack of old men on the team, and many other 
things confront us and demand an extraordinary ef
fort on the part of everyone. But enough of excuses. 
We have no time for them. We have lost one game 
to a superior team; we have gained experience that 
will carry us far on the road to triumph. We have 
fppght and lost, but we rise from the conflict stronger
and better than ever. The easy path has ever been 
the wrong one. A victory easily won is but half a 
victory. Let every man keep plugging away and 
the laurel must crown our efforts. Let us make our 
failures be but stepping-stones to success.
FOOTBALL ASSISTANTS.
The constitution of the Athletic Association of the 
Carnegie Technical Schools says, Article IX, Sec
tion 3:
Second-assistant football managers shall be elect
ed by the respective schools (Science, Design and In
dustries) not later than one month before the first 
game of the season.
This should have ben done at the last of the 
1909-10 term but was neglected on account of the, 
confusion of accompanying the drafting of a new con
stitution. This matter has reached a stage where 
something must be done. The work of managing the 
football team now rests entirely upon the shoulders 
of Manager Scott and his assistant. We 
would suggest that the President of the Senior 
or upper class of each school call a mass meeting of 
his school some time within the coming week and 
have the question settled. Men who are interested in 
the managing end of football should get around* and 
see that their names are considered when the vote 
comes.
YOUR PAPER.
Did it ever occur to you that the Tartan is your 
paper, that it represents an institution of which you 
are a vital factor? Did you ever stop to consider 
just how much the success or failure of the Tartan 
rests upon your shoulders?
The college paper -which does not represent every 
part of that college is not a college paper. It does 
not accomplish the primary object of its existence. 
Carnegie Tech is divided up into four schools and 
many, many classes. It is our aim to represent each 
school and each class thoroughly and impartially and 
to reflect the sentiment of our college in a way that 
will demand the recognition of our sister colleges. 
We cant do it unless every man in Tech co-operates 
with us. See that your class representative hands 
in news concerning your class; criticise where 
criticism is needed; get your Tartain every week 
and read it. Help make our paper a living, breath
ing part of a real, live institution.
The University of Pittsburgh now has a weekly 
paper, The Pitt Weekly. The first issue looks very' 
good and we wish our neighbors across the way' 
every possible success in their new venture.

Miss West had a most enjoyable visit with Mr. and 
Mrs. Carnegie at Skibo Castle this summer. One of 
the customs of the castle that is rather unique is the 
way that dinner is announced. A man in Scottish cos
tume plays the bag-pipe and then precedes the family 
party to the table, still playing lustily. He stops be
hind Mr. Carnegies chair and plays until the first 
course is on the table. This same piper awakens the 
family in the morning with some such lively tune 
as Johnnie, Are You Up Yet?
Mr. Carnegie has four religious sects among his 
servants and for the benefit of all, he built a hall 
where they have four services each Sunday. All the 
servants and retainers go to all the services so that
peace and harmony reign supreme on that day. In
this tactful way, the great philanthropist has made 
his different kinds of people content.
After several days of delay on account of bad 
weather, the tennis tournament started last Monday. 
A great deal of interest has been shown by the girls 
and large audiences have watched every match. Part 
of the first round has been played off with the fol
lowing scores:
R. McKnight won from C. Rutherford 6-1, 6-1.
M. Craighead won from M. Roberts, 6-2, 6-0.
H. Stewart won from B. Steiner 6-0, 6-0.
L. Crosby won from C. Jayme 6-2, 6-2.
CRUCIBLE CLUB.
The Crucible Club held its first social meeting on 
Friday evening, October 7. President Engelbrecht 
made a short address of welcome to the new mem
bers. During the evening several of the older men 
regaled those present with stories and tales of 
gravel. Mr. Dick Brown especially pleased with 
his gentlemanly manner and fluent flow of language. 
Refreshments were served later in the evening by 
Messrs. Bauer and McIntosh. Judging by the first 
meeting, the Crucibles should have a most suc
cessful year.
A prominent member of the Lafayette faculty says 
that mathematics is the most overrated and useless 
of college studies.
GLEE CLUB.
There will be a try-out and rehearsal of tlia Glee 
and Mandolin Clubs on Sunday afternoon at 2 oclock 
sharp. Everyone who has not tried-out kindly do 
so on Sunday, as this will be the last chance to 
make the clubs. The rehearsal will be held in the 
A. I. Assembly Hall. Every one bring his instru
ment.
As there will also be a business meeting on Sun
day, it is very important that both new and old men 
be present.
Wilbur P. Gettman, President.
SOPHOMORE CLASS.
On Thursday, September 6th, the Applied Science 
Sophomores held a meeting to elect officers for the 
year. President Dornberger gave an address in 
which he spoke of the future needs of the class. 
Treasurer Andrews turned in his report as to the fin
ancial condition of the class. This report was ac
cepted. The election was then held, and the follow
ing officers elected:
President............................................................S. J. Taylor
Vice President.........................................C. L. Kukovitch
............A. W. Simpson
.......................J. C. Seigle
Tartan Representative..............................E. E. Duff, Jr.

Auditing Committee, M. Stubnitz, J. F. Tabler, C.
F. Wright.
At the last class meeting, resolutions were passed 
regarding the conduct of the Plebes, who have al
ready caused about enough trouble. The Plebes 
must wear their green caps on and in the vicinity of 
the school grounds. Violation of this resolution will 
bring another collection and consequent auction of 
miscellaneous hats. Plebes, remember the class 
fight!
It is as a class, as well as individuals, that we 
mourn the death of Mr. Elric G. Hawkins, better 
known to most of us as Red. Mr. Hawkins, who 
was vice president of the class during the second 
semester, was killed this summer while returning 
from work to his home in New Brighton, Pa. He 
was struck by an express train when crossing the 
bridge near his home, and was instantly killed.

SCHOOL OF APPLIED INDUSTRIES OPENS.
Monday, October 3rd was registration day for the 
School of Applied Industries for the term 1910-1911. 
The night men registered on Thursday and Friday 
of the same week. Up to and including Saturday, 
October 8, 233 men have been given matriculation 
cards for the day school and 327 for the night. It is 
expected that these figures will be largely increased 
in the near future, as in this school many men enter 
late. In the night classes, students are enrolled at 
any time during the year. Compared with the num
ber registered last year at this tim&, the figures show 
an increase of about seven per cent in the enroll
ment in both the day and night courses.
Beginning with this year, the courses will be three 
years in length. In the day school, 154 men are en
rolled in the first year class, 30 in the middle, and
49 in the upper. Included in these classes are nine 
men who are taking special short courses.
Next year Dean Connelley expects to open the 
school on the same date that the Science and Design 
schools open. This will be a welcome improvement, 
as heretofore the two other schools have grown to 
know each other before the Industrials enter. Na
turally, this has led to a somewhat divided spirit 
among the schools which is anything but helpful to 
the Schools as a whole.
Next year it is probable that all feeling will be 
eliminated. Dean Connelly may rest assured that his 
endeavor to unify the schools will meet with the com
plete approval and the aid of the student body.

A lady teacher in Sunday school informed her hus

was going to have Christmas exercises, and that he 
should pay for printing a banner in which he ac
quiesced. The husband having been called out of 
town, it occurred to his wife that she had neglected 
to tell him what she wanted printed on the banner. 
She rushed to the telegraph office and sent the follow
ing message:
Unto us a child was born. Eight feet long and 
two feet wide. WIFE.
The husband has departed for parts unknown. 
Perhaps he will be at the county fair.Clipped.

INCIDENTS.
By Wee MacGreegor.
A motley gang of students stood on the walk lead
ing to the Science Building one day last week. On 
close inspection, they proved to be Sophomores and 
evil was in their hearts. One by one, unsuspecting 
Plebes passed through the crowd on their way to 
classes. If he wore the little green-button lid which 
is the symbol of his lowliness he was unharmed. If 
he wore any other kind of head-gear, he suddenly 
found himself in the midst of a revolving wheel of 
bodies and when he got out of the whirlpool he found 
himself minus his hat. He was then told to get a 
real, fresh brain-warmer and was released. In 
fifteen minutes forty hats and caps of all descrip
tions were captured by the determined Sophs. The 
objectionable sky-pieces were then put in a vacant 
locker and the key was thrown away. Now the 
Plebes who got caps at first are smiling and the 
others are ruefully digging down into their jeans 
for the fifty cents which stands between them and 
a bonnet.
A couple of big Plebes walked determinedly up to 
an innocent-looking Soph a day after the hat-confiscation. Who got those hats, one asked, we 
are after them and mean to get them. The Soph 
regarded his questioners amusedly. Then a brilliant 
thought forced its way into the solid ivory. Say, 
he said, as if reluctantly. I cant tell you anything 
about them. The Plebes advanced belligerently. 
Well, if I must, I must, said the Soph resignedly. 
Do you know LevineNig Levine, they call him? 
The Plebes knew him. Hes got all of the hats in 
his locker, continued the wise one. The Plebes left 
in a hurry. An hour later Levine was seen chasing 
around the Science building with a bunch of Plebes 
after him. He was shouting, I dont know anything 
about it! I dont know anything about it!
A dozen Tech men secured seats for the theater 
last Wednesday. The seats were in the first row of 
the gallery. When they came in to sit down, it was 
discovered the four of them held checks for seats that 
were not. The calcium lights had been placed in 
the space which they had reserved. With a howl, 
they hunted up the ticket office where they were

given seats in the third row. It was much nicer, 
they explained afterwards, one isnt so close to the 
stage, you know. The rest of the bunch understood 
just how it was.
This is where we play a tie game, quoth the Soph 
as he put a double knot in the cord which bound the 
unlucky Freshs wrists.
O, marry me! the youth exclaimed, 
Upon my knees I woo you!
Nay, nay, said she, but I will be 
A gentle sister to you.
Alright, he cried, his cheek aglow, 
Ill treat you like a sister.
So saying he, quite tenderly,
Took both her hands and kissed her.
Julian Kennedys definition of an engineer: A man 
who can do with one dollar, something that any fool 
can do with ten.
Mrs. Wetherby: What is a Glee Club, Hiram?
Mr. Wetherby: Some kind of college base ball 
team. Josiah writes that he is second base on the 
Atwater Glee Club. I tell ye, college athletics is a 
great thing.

Persevere in private and secret prayer, however 
little good you seem to yourself to feel by it. Do 
not leave it off for fear of becoming formal. If it 
be but accompanied with keeping of the command
ments, it will do you good beyond the knowledge 
of man; just as a river which seems to part with 
nothing of its waters, and makes no immediate dif
ference in the look of the just about it, may yet, in 
a silent and gradual way, feed and cherish the whole 
country round.Keble.
