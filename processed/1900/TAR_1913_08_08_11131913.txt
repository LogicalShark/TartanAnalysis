The pageant that will take place on 
the 25th of November will far surpass 
anything ever before attempted by 
this institution. The pageant is in 
four parts, which will be connected by 
a prologue in the character of The 
Scholar.
The first part, which will be taken 
by the Science School is a scene from 
the Court of Queen Elizabeth. The 
Alchemists, who were in vogue at the 
time, attempt to deceive the queen by 
their tricks. Wm. Gilbert, a young 
scholar, demonstrates some of the 
uses of the Magnet and in so doing 
confutes the contentions of the Al
chemist. He is liberally rewarded by 
the queen and the Alchemists are ban
ished.
The second part is a secene taken 
from' Andrew Carnegies book on 
James Watt. In this scene is por
trayed the formation of Watts part
nership with Bolton. The fact that 
this scene is taken from Mr. Car
negies book will make it doubly inter 
esting.
The third part is a scene in the life 
of Michael Angelo. The scene is the 
portrayal of Pope Julius taking Mich
ael Angelo from the construction of 
the tombs to the painting of the fa
mous ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. 
The Design School will portray this 
scene.
The fourth scene will be one of 
domestic splendor. In this part the 
M. M. C. S. will portray a scene in 
the beautiful life of St. Marguerite of 
Scotland. This scene will not only 
reflect the life of St. Marguerite but 
will also give some idea of the field 
covered by the school.
The entire pageant will be one of 
costumed splendor, there being about 
sixty people in each scene. The facul
ty committee in charge consists of 
Mr. Long, Mr. Calderwood, Mr. Par
ry, Mr. Goeghen, and Mr. Stevens, 
the author of the pageant.
The following is the official program 
for the day:
3:30 P. M.Carnegie Music Hall. The 
conferring of the Honorary De
gree of Doctor of Engineering

VARSITY LOSES HARD SlRUGLE 
ALLEGHENY WINNING; S(0RE 17-0
Allegheny won its game from 
Carnegie Tech by a score of 17 to 0 
Saturday. The crowd that watched 
the home team fighting against odds 
was one of the largest that Tech has 
gathered this season, in spite of the 
threatening skies. A muddy field 
made heavy going for both teams, but 
placed the heaviest handicap on the 
light Plaid squad.
Almost every kind of good foot
ball that is possible was put up during 
the fight. Open play, with a consid
erable number of forward passes, was 
varied with close formations using 
line-plunging and mass plays. Alle
gheny gained most on the latter, when 
the big backfield men smashed holes 
through the primary defense of the 
Techites to be held by the secondary 
line. Repeatedly the home team 
saved its goal line by heroic play 
when the ball was within their 15-yard 
line.
It took all of the first quarter for 
Allegheny to score its first touch
down. After the kickoff Tech was 
forced to punt to Allegheny, being 
held for no gains. By making two 
first downs Allegheny took the ball 
to Techs 22-yard line, only to lose on 
downs. A punt by Clair and a fumble 
recovered by Fulmer gave the ball to 
Carnegie in Alleghenys territory. 
Tech failed to solve the heavy Alle
gheny line and punted inside its op
ponents 15-yard line.
Then followed ineffectual attempts 
by both sides to make distance, end
ing in kicking. When the exchange 
ended the ball was on Techs 43-yard 
line. Allegheny carried the ball to the
22 mark on two first downs, then Ar
nold took the ball around right end, 
shaking off the Tech tacklers, for the 
distance to the goal line. Thomas
FIRST CONCERT.
On Friday, November 21, the Musi
cal Clubs will make the first appear
ance of the season at Wildwood, Pa. 
The Clubs will have a special car to 
and from the concert and will be 
treated to a sumptuous supper on 
their arrival there. The Clubs on 
this concert will consist mostly of 
the old men. Some of the new music 
is worked up to such good shape that 
it is hoped the glee club will be able 
to work at least three new selections. 
The Mandolin club will no doubt be 
able to play all the new stuff because
kicked the goal. The time for the 
first quarter was up as Arnold started 
on his run. After ten minutes of play 
in the second period Allegheny scored 
its second touchdown.
When the last quarter started Met
calf gained three yards before Burke 
intercepted a forward pass started by 
Ricker. Receiving the ball on Techs 
two-yard line, he ran the length of the 
field, but was called back for having 
allowed one foot to touch the side
line 29 yards from Alleghenys goal.
His run netted 69 yards for his team
and took theball outof dangerous
territory.

The speaker of the day was Mr. 
Early, claim agent for the American 
Sheet & Tin Plate Company, was in
troduced by a few remarks from 
Dean Leete. Extracts from Mr. 
Earlys speech are given below:
Mr. Chairman and gentlemen:A 
man is presumed to be able to do that 
which he undertakes to do. I was 
asked to speak about claims and their 
adjustment because I know so much 
about it. I am often astounded at my 
own moderation in making such a 
statement for I have listened to pitiful 
stories for thirty years until tales of 
sorrow are sweet sentiment to me, the 
tympanum of my ear is gone and I 
am totally deaf in my left ear.
,mrl narly leaving the hcience tWglN
Some things militate against young 
men, some are propitious and I 
thought that I had better speak along 
these lines to you. I have selected as 
my subject Salt and Advice. There 
is nothing that makes such a slight 
drain upon ones philanthropy or re
duces the corpulency of the plethoric 
purse so little as the giving of advice. 
Indeed, the Arabs, in their fondness 
for epigrammatic utterance, have a 
saying to the effect that salt and ad
vice are cheap. While this may be 
true it is well to bear in mind that 
there may be a vast difference be
tween the price of a thing and its in
trinsic value.

It has always been the aim of The 
Tartan to publish all news relative to 
the student body at Carnegie. But we 
are not always in a position to get 
advance notices of functions which 
are to be held here, unless they are 
called to our attention. This year we 
want the students to feel more than 
ever that The Tartan is their own 
newspaper and bulletin. All notices 
which are to be brought before the 
attention of the students should ap
pear in these columns. In fact there 
is no better way to bring such news 
to th attention of all the students.
So we shall be glad to receive for pub
lication all bulletins and announce
ments of any kind pertaining to the 
college life and activities of our stu
dents. We are sometimes crowded 
for space, but if we can find little 
room we will make room for student 
notices. All material to be published 
in the Thursday issue should be left 
in the boxes of The Tartan not later 
than 9 A. M. on Monday morning.

In a short time now, we will cele
brate the birthday of the founder of 
this institution of learning. It is sure
ly fitting that we should thus com
memorate the event. Probably few 
of us realize what an auspicious be
ginning our schools have had, due 
to the generosity of one man. The 
trials and struggles for existence that 
other universities have had to over
come during their early days we have 
been fortunate enough to escape. In 
the last eight years we have made a 
truly wondrous advancement. No 
other school in this country has had 
such a remarkable growth and devel
opment in such a short time. This 
speaks well for the ability and skill of 
those who are directing the progress 
of Carnegie, and we must certainly 
feel grateful to them. Each year we 
are growing stronger and our repu
tation is being enhanced as an insti
tution whose graduates are amounting 
to something in the world. But with 
this success we must remember that 
gratitude is due the man who found
ed Carnegie, and on the 25th of No
vember we will have an opportunity 
to express this gratitude. Let us all 
put forth our strongest efforts towards 
the success of this celebration, and to 
show true appreciation; let us also 
remember that we must not be con
tent with past growth; we must con
stantly strive for greater things.

When the football team trots on the 
field before a game and the players 
form into line to run through the 
last signal drill, the cheer-leader wild
ly swings his arms and a mighty 
cheer goes up for the warriors. Un
der cover of the noise, a larger squad 
takes its place in blanketed rows on 
the side-line benches almost under the 
stands. Sometimes unnoticed,usu
ally forgotten,this little band drops 
into place to shiver and hope while 
the fight goes on. They are not even 
allowed to relieve their tense inter
est with the cheers and yells that 
serve to let out the spirits of the root
ers. They must wait in silence.
Then, after a fierce scrimmage, 
some star is hurt or shows signs of 
exhaustion. A coach turns toward 
the bench and calls a name, and th2 
owner leaps to his feet, throws off 
his blanket and hurries to the side
lines for the instructions which he 
is to carry into the game. As he 
takes the place of the other player, 
who limps from the field, the stands 
take up his name and send it up in 
a heaven-reaching shout. The substi
tute is no longer a scrub, he is a var
sity man.
This is what happens and is seen 
at almost every game. It is what 
makes scrubdom worth livingthe 
hope of getting into a game. But, 
what of the others who remain on 
the bench?
How many of our dear readers 
make it a point to go to the athletic 
field every late afternoon to see the 
practice scrimmages? We know they 
are few, but they who go see another 
reel of pictures.
The varsity has the ball. One of 
the backs is sent against the line of 
his opponents. He gains two, three, 
five yards before a little tackle drags
him down. You hear the coach cry, 
That was rotten, Brown. Try that 
again, and get through this time. 
Again, the little tackle downs the 
giant back, but his work goes unno
ticed while the imperfections of the 
varsity man are brought to light. That 
is the main object of the scrub team1, 
to hammer the varsity into shape.
And the varsity players usually get 
the benefits of all of the praise and 
adulation of the student-body, when 
a considerable share should go to the 
lowly scrubs. Some of the latter feel 
that they are martyrs. They are not, 
in spite of the tendency to make them 
so by neglect of appreciation of their 
work. But they are heroes! Any man 
who goes out for the team, naturally 
with the hope of making the var
sity,and remains out until the end 
of the season, night after night, after 
the hope is gone, is as much of a 
hero as the best player on the var
sity.
And when the season draws to a 
close, as at this time of the year, and 
the squad dwindle smaller and small
er, the men that stick when their 
hope is gone, knowing that their pres
ence on the field each night will add 
a little to the improvement of the var
sitythey are heroes in the same 
class as the knights of old.
This, our double-barreled sermon, 
is not to propose a monument to these 
aforesaid heroes. Frankly, we want 
to induce the scrubs to stick, and, 
at the same time, we strive to arouse 
a greater sense of appreciation of the 
little band of faithful. The ones who 
are best fitted to appreciate these 
scrubs are the students who came out 
for the team early in the season and 
then quit.
Quit is the only name for the ac
tions of most of these. A bump, or a 
bruise, or a scratch is often enough 
to uncover a tremendous amount of 
yellow. A harsh or rough word, wellintended, from the coaches, hurt some 
mothers-boys feelings. A sudden ac
cession of modesty, expressed by, Im 
not good enough. No use in my be
ing out, contributed to the deser
tion of others. But most wonderful 
to note is the number who were too 
busy to come out every night, and 
who are now enjoying leisure enough 
to laugh at the poor boobs who 
remain in practice when all self-in 
terest is useless.
We hope, with the athletic authori
ties, that some more or less valuable 
mementos can be given to the scrubs 
of this year, that their faithfulness 
and loyalty may be appreciated by the 
entire student-body. We also hope 
that pity, not censure, may be meted 
out in full measure to the parlor he
roes who could have made the team 
if they had wanted to. And the next 
time you cheer for the varsity, put 
your heart into it and then into a 
following cheer for the Scrubs.
Bulletins issued by the Interstate 
Commerce Commission show that for 
the last three months of 1912 there 
were killed 7 persons on interstate 
railways as against 10 in 1911 and 41 
in 1910, for the same period.Case

Oh, say, can you see while October 
abides,
What we awesomely hailed at th 
semesters beginning,
With split skirt and knock-knees thru 
the perilous slides 
From the windows we watched, on 
its drunk underpinning.
And the tanks gay red glare, the 
beams writhing in air,
Gave dubious proof that our lab, was 
still there.
Oh, say, does that hydraulic lablet 
still sway 
Oer the yawning ravine and how 
long can it stay?
On the slope dimly seen thru the 
mists of the deep 
Where the tin cans perfume in hau
teur reposes,
What is that which the fog that 
would make angels weep,
As it tangoes about, half conceals, 
half discloses?
Now it catches the view, now it sinks 
in the stew 
In a serpentine glide now slinking 
from view.
Tis the first aiding cable; Oh, firm 
may it tie 
The poor tottering lab. to a beanery 
pie.
It has gone; tis no more; it has van
ished in space 
Like Loves giddy young dream, just 
a deficit leaving.
It has slipped from the beanery.?
yearning embrace 
And has left as a token the concrete 
still heaving,
The sorrowing tank trickling tears 
down the bank.
At intervals splutters, well, Ill be 
blank-blank.
The obtuse-angled lablet has hied it
self hence;
The jokes on somebody; hang the 
expense!
But the shrine of Hungarian Fools 
hash still stands 
The day yet remote that shall witness 
its flitting 
It will still play the dickens with di
gestive glands,
And debauch decent livers at one 
single sitting.
But eat there we must, for our hunger 
tis just,
And this be our motto, in pepsin we 
trust.
But the jar-jangled lablet no longer 
shall sprawl 
On groggy foundation in sight of us 
all. S. S. K.
Winners Will make fp seaml
six and a fraction miles through

candidates on the squad will enter the

will be selected for the purpose of 
running two teams if permitted at 
Crafton. Capt. Haselton is the favor
ite, but he will in no way have a run
away race. Dunseith, who has been 
showing up well in practice, should 
prove a close contender, while Mc
Millan and Handleman should gi^e 
good accounts of themselves.

Because of the Pitt-W. & J. attrac
tion Saturday afternoon, Manager 
Haaren has arranged to stage the 
Bethany-Tech encounter in the morn
ing, the kick-off being called for 10 
oclock. The rooters should show 
their appreciation of the managers 
action and be present in large num
bers to witness this game which is 
the next to last one on the schedule.
When two more Saturdays have 
passed, the 1913 football season as far 
as Tech is concerned, will have closed 
and the teams record gone down in 
the schools history. The outcome of 
the final contests will have a most im
portant bearing on the teams stand
ing. If two more victories are an
nexed it will' stamp itself one of the 
best Tech has produced,second only 
to the great 1909 eleven, which was 
the first and only Plaid team so far, 
to earn a percentage greater than .500 
in games won and lost. This latter 
feat may be duplicated this year. 
Should even break be the result of the 
next two games, the average record 
of Tech team's will have been made; 
but ifwe refuse to consider further. 
The team must not lose the final 
games.
If last years struggle is a criterion 
of what may be expected Saturday, 
we should advise the more delicate 
students to have their nerves exam
ined and strengthened before then. 
The memory of Techs thrilling 14-7 
victory still lingers in the minds of 
those who witnessed it. The Tartan 
suggests that every rooter, Senior as 
well as Plebe, procure a small mega
phone. By use of these, more noise 
with less effort may be made. Come 
prepared to shout the team' to victory 
if such a thing were possible to do.

The Girls of the M. M. C. S. dormi
tory gave a delightful tea for the Fac
ulty of the M. M. C. S. on Saturday 
afternoon, November 8. The dormi
tory was very attractively decorated 
in chrysanthemums, with a back
ground of red and gold oak leaves.
On account of the threatening 
weather during the late afternoon, 
there were not as many guests as 
were expected, although the living 
rooms were comfortably filled during 
mosf of the time.
The committee in charge were, An
na Thomas, President of the Dormi
tory, Miss Isabell Haag, and Miss

At the election of the Third Year 
Night Class, the following were elect
ed officers:
A. C. Dalzell, President.
W. H. Hofer, Vice President.
E. A. Brown, Jr., Secretary.
J. E. Hinchcliffe, Historian.
W. P. Duff, Tartan Rep.
A resolution favoring a Second An
nual Night Science Smoker, was 
unanimously adopted.
The election throughout was lively 
and closely contested, and the class, 
while very noticeably decreased in 
number since last term, showed itself 
capable of the real Carnegie spirit, 
and from all indications the Class His
torian will be kept busy.
Another meeting is to be called at 
any early date at which it is under
stood the Mechanicals will ask the 
School Administration through the 
class, to have their Machine Design 
classes transferred to the new Ma 
chinery Hall, which they claim is 
better lighted and more convenient.

The department of journalism of 
the University of Kansas maintains 
that newspaper writing should be 
taught in every Kansas high school. 
The reason given is that the use of 
English and the cultivation of accu
racy of observation can be learned 
better in that way than any other. 
Otterbein Review.
she marvels ov the hpectroscopel
One of the most fascinating branch
es of modern science is that known as 
spectroscopy. It has, among other 
things, given us a knowledge of the 
chemical constitution of the distant 
heavenly bodies, and thrown light on 
many other puzzling astronomic prob
lems. Since the discovery by Stokes 
while he was Faradays assistant 
that the spectrum of the electric light 
could be enormously extended at the 
violet end by the substitution of 
quartz for ordinary glass in the prisms 
and lenses, a vast new department of 
spectroscopy has been uncovered. And 
in this field the organic chemist has 
been particularly active.
In a recent address before the Roy
al Institution, Dr. J. J. Dobbie told a 
most interesting story of this fifty 
years development. He particularly 
dwelt upon the utility of these absorp
tion spectra in studying those curious 
organic compounds which, with the 
same chemical formulae, differ mark
edly in properties, and sometimes in 
appearance. When chemical analysis 
fails to show any difference between 
them, despite the obvious fact that 
they are different, the spectroscope 
steps in, and exhibits two separate 
and distinct spectrathat is, it does 
in all but one particular case.Even

In the course of a recent letter Pro
fessor H. H. Turner, of the University 
Observatory at Oxford, made the in
teresting announcement that the As
tronomer Royal of Scotland, Profes
sor Sampson, had recently worked out 
a totally new idea for the construction 
of large reflecting telescopes. Hither
to it has been possible in these instru
ments to obtain clear images only over 
a small area near the axis. If Pro
fessor Sampsons scheme works out 
in practice as it should, this small area 
of good images wili be greatly en
larged. There is every prospect, 
therefore, comments Mr. V. J. Youmans in the New York Evening 
Post, that the building of these great 
heavenly magnifying glasses will be 
entirely revolutionized in the near fu
ture. There is this prospectthat is. 
if some rich man or scientific institu
tion can be induced to provide the 
funds necessary to test Professor 
Sampsons plan. It was with the pur
pose of calling this opportunity for a 
scientific speculation to public atten
tion that Professor Turner made his 
announcement. It can hardly be 
doubted that some one will make the 
investment both promptly and gener
ously.The Outlook.

Over one hundred draughtsmen 
were present at the meeting of the 
Night Draughtsmens Club, held in 
room 104 last Thursday. The feature 
of the evening was the address given 
by Dean Connelley, whose remarks 
caused the true Carnegie Spirit to 
rise in the hearts of his hearers.
The main object of the club is to 
give all the night men a chance to 
get acquainted. A number of social 
and sporting events are being planned 
for the near future. These events will 
be further discussed at the next regu
lar meeting to be held on Thursday, 
November 13th, in room 104, and all 
night men not yet members should 
try their best to be present at this 
meeting.
A very spirited election for officers 
took place and each office was closely 
contested.
The following officers were elected:
PresidentW. E. Noble.
Vice PresidentGlynn.
SecretaryJ. S. Mooney.
TreasurerH. McKee.
Tartan and Thistle Rep.J. A. 
Stein.
The second meeting of this years 
Thistle Board was held last Wednes
day evening. The election of the of
ficers which occurred at the previous 
meeting, was confirmed, and Miss An
na M. Thomas was elected secretary 
for the coming year. It was decided 
that no organization would be allowed 
to be represented in the Thistle unless 
they had all last years bills paid up 
at the time the book goes to press, 
which will probably be February 15th. 
Thistle blanks were put out on' Mon
day and any person selling twenty of 
them will receive a free book.

The First Gym Dance for the bene
fit of the football team was a great 
success in spite of the fact that Pitts
burgh was in the throes of her first 
blizzard of the season. This undoubt
edly kept some away, but many 
braved the deep and drifting snow and 
appeared at the gym in time for the 
first extra-extra before the regular 
program. The music was of the best 
that has ever been had at a gym1 dance 
and the program1 was of the latest 
two-steps, waltzes and rags. Need
less to say, there were also some very 
delightful schottisches on the pro
gram.
Because of the several new features 
arranged by this years management, 
such as the training table and the sil
ver medals for the worthy members 
of the scrub, the regular allowance 
will be exceeded and the proceeds of 
the dance will go to help defray the 
extra expenditures.
No plea was made for the attend
ance of the student body, but it was 
very grateful to see the spirit shown 
for the purpose of helping the man
agement give a suitable recognition 
of the good work of the scrubs and 
team.

The Inter-Fraternity dance, which 
is to be held at MacDougalls Audi
torium in East Liberty, is something 
entirely new in the line of Tech 
dances. For a long time there nas
been felt a want for an affair of some 
kind which will get the fraternities to
gether, and thus increase the inter
fraternity spirit of the school. The 
date of the dance has been set for 
November 24th, the evening before 
Carnegie Day, which will make it 
possible for everyone to be there. The 
tax which has as yet not been decided 
upon will be small, and within reach 
of everyone. Dancing will begin at 
8 oclock sharp, and last until one.

Those of us who go to the Grand 
Opera House next week, beginning 
Monday afternoon, November 17th, 
will be transported from prosaic, mat
ter-of-fact twentieth century times and 
the poetic mystery of mythological 
epochs. There will be seen Neptunes 
Garden of Living Statues, in which 
will be enacted the pantomimic music 
drama of The Enchanted Pool. It 
is the sensation of the moment, a 
gorgeously embellished fantasy played 
by a company of twenty dancers, 
divers, art models and pantomimists.
Belle Story, the most charming 
vocalist who has come into vaudeville 
in recent times, is engaged to make 
her second appearance in Pittsburgh 
at the Grand this week. Miss Story 
is young and beautiful, she sings like 
a nightingale, her notes are clear, her 
voice is well modulated and she has 
remarkable range and power. Added 
to beauty are grace and naturalness 
and a personality that fairly charms 
her audiences. There will be a lot of 
other interesting and clever people in 
the bill of the week besides an exhibi
tion of very attractive motion pictures.

Clean, sweet, entertaining comedy 
is Gloomy Fanny, Allan Davis 
latest play, which will have its first 
presentation on any stage at the Duquesne next week. The fact that Mr. 
Davis is a native Pittsburgher and 
this is the second of his efforts to 
have its premier by the Davis Players 
will add more than ordinary interest 
to this new play. Mr. Davis got his 
inspiration from Morley Roberts 
story, Gloomy Fanny, which first 
appeared in serial form in the Satur
day Evening Post. The characters 
are all drawn from life in a congested 
center, and are brought out force
fully and accurately.

Christ paid a glowing tribute to 
the value of salt when delivering the 
Sermon on the Mount, for he said to 
the Apostles, having in mind to give 
them hope and inspiration: Ye are 
the salt of the earth.
Advice may be cheap, unless you 
get it from an attorney. It may be 
worthless if it is bad. Advice, too, 
may be of great value if, when fol
lowed, it makes for the betterment of 
the individual to whom given. Youth, 
as a rule, does not extend an enthusi
astic welcome to advice. I know this 
from1 personal experience, for I was 
youthful myself years ago, and I also 
know it because I have two sons. The 
relations between my father and me 
were often strained, even unto the 
creaking point, because of fathers gift
ed genius for giving me advice about 
matters concerning which my intelli
gence was superior to his. Where I 
was brought up, a boy was not con
sidered normal who didnt know more 
than his father. The scriptures say 
that 'a wise son maketh a glad father.
I was usually in the unfortunate posi
tion of an unwise son making a mad 
father, for father never concurred in 
my opinion that I knew more than he 
did. As I look back to the days of my 
boyhood, I now recall that I never 
had such a firm grasp upon universal 
knowledge as I had when I was about 
twenty, and although I now realize 
how little I know now, yet I feel that 
my scanty supply will never become 
entirely depleted because of the con
stant and generous contributions made 
thereto by my sons. As we advance 
in life we learn the limit of our ability. 
But, after all, I would rather be young 
and unconscious of my limitations 
than to be traveling down the western 
slope of the divide, though possessing 
all the wisdom of Solomon. It is a 
priceless privilege to be young.
My young friends, you are just 
beginning your lives. You are now 
laying the foundations. It is to be 
hoped that you will lay them broad 
and deep and use plenty of concrete, 
for as a house cannot stand that is 
built upon the sand, so a reputation 
cannot endure that is not built upon 
a proper foundation. The superstruc
tures are yet to be built. How will 
you build them? The responsibility 
is largely upon you. In a few years 
you will be in the University of ex
perience. There you will be in a large 
class and you will have a great deal 
of keen competition. You should lay 
your plans in life for success and you 
should have knowledge of those 
things which lead to success.
Circumstances may change your 
plans, but it is well to have them so 
that you may know which way you 
are going. The speed you make is 
not so important as the direction you 
take. It is a bad thing to be in a 
hurry if you are going in the wrong 
direction. No matter how slowly you 
are going, you are going too fast if 
you are going wrong. It is not so 
important whence you came as whith
er you are bound.
What are the things that make for 
success? First of all you should

Life is the most munificent gift of 
God. It is our Christian duty to 
guard and protect it. Life is a miser
able possession without health, which 
Emerson says is an asset of such 
priceless value as to defy the genius 
of mathematics in calculating.
Second, cultivate a religious senti
ment, not the mournful kind, not the 
variety with a solemn and longitudi
nal face, and a sepulchral voice, but 
one that finds happiness in making 
others happy, one that has more kind 
words in its vocabulary than harsh 
ones. In your social life cultivate a 
entiment that is free from corruption, 
from evil, from wrongdoing; a senti
ment that stands for purity of thought, 
purity of relation, the higher, nobler 
and ethical quality. Religion does not 
militate against happiness. It is not 
necessary to be base, vulgar, and com
monplace in order to be happy. Avoid 
all evil desires, shun contaminating 
influences as you would deadly and 
infectious diseases. In short, keep the 
mind healthy and free from those in
fluences which tend to disintegrate 
the moral sense. If in your life you 
find that youre going wrongback 
up! Dont delay, because delays in 
correcting evil practises are danger
ous. Dr. Henry Churchill King, Pres
ident of Oberlin College, in his Ra
tional Living, says: It is a startling
fact to face that a mans personal 
habits are largely fixed before he is 
twenty.
Cultivate a cheerful disposition. 
Dont think that a sense of humor and 
an ability to laugh empty mental lim
itations. Some people of infirm judg
ment think that if a man has a sense 
of humor he hasnt much of any other 
sense. It often happens that sphinxlike expression and an incapacity for 
laughter are the products of a vacant 
mind. Try and make two grins grow

where one grouch grew before.
There is one virtue that is of pre
eminent importance to young people 
in starting their lives and that is truth. 
Never scar your soul with a lie. When 
occasion arises, let your motto be to 
Tell the truth, the whole truth, and 
nothing but the truth. I dont mean 
that one should run around and tell 
all he knows. While it may not take 
much time to do it, its bad practice.
Punctuality is an important virtue 
A golden opportunity is often lost for
ever by being late. Once upon a time 
there was a young mall named Johnny 
who achieved such marvelous success 
by his punctuality that his virtue has 
become immortalized in the classic 
utterance: Johnny on the spot.
What are some of the causes of 
failure? Laziness is the most serious 
cause of failure. So is poor judgment 
lack of fore-thought, self-indulgence 
and ignorance. You should try to cul
tivate a devoted interest in what you 
are doing. It is a laudible ambition to 
aspire to a better position than you 
may have, but you cant better your 
condition by neglecting the position 
you have. Thats the unfailing recipe 
for never getting promoted. The 
world may owe you a living, but it is 
your business to get out and collect 
it. If you want success you must take 
off your coat, roll up your sleeves and 
get a cohesive grip on the pick by the 
usual formula and dig and G.:g and 
keep on digging.
This is the day of specialism. The 
day of the Jack of all Trades is gone. 
Whatever you do, do well. There is 
only one way of doing a thing right. 
You can do it wrong in many ways. 
It all depends upon the versatile stu
pidity of the operator.
Economy is one of the potent fac
tors that make for success. I dont 
mean penuriousness, false economy, 
or right down stinginess. I dont be
lieve in squeezing the dollar until the 
Goddess of Liberty gets startled at the 
familiarity. I would have the young 
man as soon as he starts in business 
life, inoculated right in the most sen
sitive part of the cerebrum with the 
Savings Bank Serum, and I would 
have the inoculation repeated until 
saving becomes an uncontrollable
habit. Dont think you are going to 
have fine sailing all the time. Trouble 
is the biggest Trust I know of. The 
Sherman anti-trust law cant dissolve 
it. Everybody is a stockholder in it, 
and the worst of it is that the stock 
is non-transferable. You cant give 
it away. The Trust is a sure dividend 
payer too. The dividends are not paid 
to all the stockholders at the same 
time, but they come in time as surely 
as death itself. What a beneficient 
thing it is that the greatest troubles 
we have are those which never hap
pen.
After all is said and done, the chief 
aim of life is to be happy and content
ed. Dont let your life become un
happy by a vaulting ambition, for: 
Ambition has but one reward for all 
A little power, a little transient fame. 
A grave to rest in and a fading name.
In closing, let me enjoin upon you 
that you live your lives so that when 
the shadows are lengthening, it may 
be truthfully said of you that,
Ye are the salt of the earth.
CLASSIFIED LIST OF TARTAN ADVERTISERS
We have classified our advertisers so that our readers may use the list 
for reference before making purchases. The grouping furnishes an excellent 
variety of merchants for any article which a student, alumnus or faculty 
member would be likely to buy, and there is no valid reason of which we are 
aware that would justify anyone interested in the welfare of The Tartan in 
making purchases from any but merchants who so kindly make such a publi
cation possible. Be sure, also, to give one of the purchase stubs, which you 
will find enclosed in your Tartan every other week, to the clerk from whom 
you make the purchase. The stubs, we have found, make pleased advertisers 
and help to get new ones. May we depend upon YOU to take this as a re
sponsibility to your Institution and to The Tartan.

Pongest Tence in the Worldl
There is in Western Australia a 
fence, said to be the longest in the 
world. It was made necessary, says 
an exchange, by the devastating ten
dencies of rabbits. The fence extends 
from the temperate regions into the 
tropics. It is twelve hundred miles
long, and, except for gate6, has no 
breaks.
The fence is divided into sections, 
each of which is under the control 
of an inspector. Boundary riders con
stantly traverse the barrier to see that 
it is in good condition and able to pre
vent any possible inroads of rabbits. 
The Outlook.
We recommend the merchants advertising in the sartan as the best in townl shey will give you the best prices and qualityl
