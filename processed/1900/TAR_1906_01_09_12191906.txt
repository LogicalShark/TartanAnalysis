Failure Necessary to A use for the Nitro= Address of Mr. Arthur 
Success gen of the Air A. Hamershlag
Too much good luck is fatal to hap
piness. Many a good man has been 
ruined by prosperity.
When achievement crowns every 
effort, some characters which owe 
their strength to the capacity for fight
ing disintegrate and fall to pieces, lit
erally as a horse goes wrong from 
lack of exercise.
As Bernard Shaw says in Man and 
Superman: A man might stand an 
hour or two of happiness and be none 
the worse for it. But a lifetime of 
happiness! No man on earth could 
possibly bear it!
It takes failure to make you appre
ciate your blessings. The man who 
has enjoyed uninterrupted success in 
business, who has never been swamp
ed by a panic, nor spent sleepless 
nights wondering how he was going 
to escape bankruptcy, waxes either fat 
and gross, or grows thin and nervous, 
preying on his fellows. He becomes 
a financial blood-sucker, and loses all 
the attributes which make him useful 
as a friend or neighbor.
In human lives, struggle is neces
sary to strength. Yet, on the other 
hand, no one cares for the man whose 
every act requires assistance from 
relatives and friends. We naturally 
require that a mans strength of pur
pose shall come from within. Yet the 
strongest souls are those whose wings 
have won their strength by a strug
gle writh shackles which effort has cast 
off.
Men who have acquired wealth from 
judicious investments, who never 
have known what it was to bear the 
burden and heat of the day, but who 
have only to utilize the cool of the 
evening to cut off the coupons of their 
government four per cents, to earn a 
living that other men are obliged to 
sweat for, wax fat and misshapen in 
soul as well as body. Their arrogance 
leads them to say to the less success
ful: Why dont you do as I do? I
bought stocks when they were at the
bottom. Now they are at the top,
and I am rich. Every man had the 
same opportunity that I did. Why 
did not you, my impecunious friend, 
take advantage of the same circum
stances?
This inability to take the unsuc
cessful mant point of view is what
leads to anarchy. The poor man does 
(iContinued on Page 2)
It really begins to look as if the 
chemists were going to make a com
mercially valuable substance out of 
that very abundant out inert element, 
the nitrogen of the atmosphere. How 
the fixation of atmospheric nitrogen, 
or its combination with oxygen in 
commercially usable products, has 
been accomplished by the use of 
powerful electrical discharges, has al
ready been told in these columns. 
Now the technologists are investigat
ing the economics of the process and 
find that the artificial nitrates are al
ready nearly, if not quite, able to 
compete with the natural product. 
Commenting on the plant now in op
eration in Norway, The Electrical 
World notes that the subject pos
sesses far more than a merely theo
retical interest. It says:
If one stops to contemplate the 
result of a famine in natural nitrates 
the outlook is something astonishing. 
Bereft of nitric acid, chemical manu
facture would be an exceedingly bad 
way all along the line. It is the uni
versal cheap oxidizing agent in addi
tion to all its more direct uses, and 
beyond this is the basis of practically 
all explosives. The Peace Society 
should view with alarm the new pro
cess as tending to the perpetuation 
of villainous saltpeter and all its 
militant train. ******
As to the economic side of the 
process, the case is not yet clear. 
The reported consumption of electri
cal energy is about 4.1 kilowatt-hour 
per pound avoirdupois of nitric acid. 
If this figure can actually be main
tained, the process looks feasible com
mercially when very cheap power can 
be obtained, especially as the product 
should be of rather a high grade. The 
strongest commercial acid costs in this 
country between 5 and 6 cents per 
pound by the car-boy, and with proper 
allowance for dealers' profits it looks 
very much as if, using cheap' water
power as a source of energy, the syn
thetic acid might be able to com
pete, if not immediately, then at some 
not distant date when natural nitrates 
must inevitably be higher than at 
present.
This, of course, the writer reminds 
us, does not take into account the

To the Students of the Carnegie
Technical Schools, Friday Morn
ing, December 14th, 19C6.
Ten OClock,
The Christmas recess marks the 
close of the fall term, with its free
dom and relaxation, and is significant 
of the development of the student 
body into organic units, bound to
gether by common of scholarship, of 
esteem and of school life. This re
cess begins on Wednesday, December 
19th, and ends at midnight, January 2. 
On January 3d at 9. A. M., when the 
classes resume, all those who fail to 
appear will have forfeited their places 
in their classes; and in order to be 
reinstated must come before the fac
ulty and its representative, the Reg
istrar, for a personal examination. 
This is merely exacting of you as stu
dents that which will be demanded 
of you after you have left s^*ool. If 
you are employed by business con
cerns, failure to report for duty is 
equivalent to a resignation; and the 
punishment which follow lapses in at
tendance and in lack of punctuality 
are usually those of dismissal. It is 
well that during your school life, you 
accustom yourselves to the same idea, 
so that when you leave us as repre
sentatives of the type of man which 
this institution produces, you will be 
able to adapt yourselves to these re
quirements.
The summing up of the term s work, 
combined with the rcent examinations, 
will enable the members of the fac
ulty to determine which of the stu
dents are prepared to advance with 
their classes, and who should be in 
the conditioned group; and also what 
particular students must, in all kind
ness to their own futures, be advised 
to leave these halls of learning. Stu
dents, like raw materials, carry with 
them imperfections. Quite like the 
factory which is producing a finished 
product, some of the material when 
it enters the establishment is found 
to be defective; some of it during the 
process of manufacture is proven to 
possess imperfections and some of it 
must necessarily be discarded and 
termed scrap, or waste. So, a stu
dent body as large as I see before 
me this morning, must possess similar

not hate the rich man for having 
money half as much ah he hates him 
for his inability to sympathize with 
misfortune. Few men hate the mere 
accumulation of wealth. They hate 
the hideous hardness of heart which 
too often accompanies it. The rich 
man, were he only as clever as he is 
rich, might sleep with far less appre
hensions from kidnapers, uynamite, 
or bullets, were he only shrewd 
enough to feign a pity, even if he reels

possibility of improvement in the pro
cess, which is a very strong one. 
Many new chemical products that 
have at first been hardly able to com
pete w'ith the natural ones have later 
pushed them hard. This was notably 
the case, we are told, with the manu
facture of alizarin and of artificial 
indigo. The writer goes on to say:
The Notodden plant as now in
stalled is on a commercial scale and 
its product of nitric acid and calcium 
nitrate should be large enough to give 
sound data for judging the commer
cial value of the process. If it suc
ceeds, as we trust it may, it will open 
up a new use for electricity on a very 
large scale.  The amount of nitric acid 
and nitrates used is tremendous, so 
that there need be little fear of over
production.
Especially is there use for a new 
industry like this as auxiliary to the 
complete development of water-powers. The standing problem of hydro
electric engineering is the utilization 
of the entire available flow. Nature is 
unkind in furnishing so uneven a 
water supply as generally exists. 
There is a real need for industries 
that can take power at times when it 
is not otherwise usable and employ 
it in amounts sufficient to prevent 
waste. Pulp-mills have sometimes 
uroved very useful auxiliaries by doing 
this very thing, and electrochemical 
works may be made even more useful 
especially in cases such as this where 
the raw material can be taiten in 
without cost or at least very cheaply, 
and whereof the product can be con
veniently stored. There are many hy
draulic powers of which the flow avail
able for power transmission purposes 
is moderate and impossible to be de
livered at very low cost. Yet the 
same privilege may for four or five 
months have thousands of horse
power running over the dam. The 
market for such extra power is diffi
cult to find, since it cannot fairly
be described even as secondary power. 
It is, however, temporary power which 
for part of the year could be put to 
good use in electrochemical indus
tries if these were of such a character 
as could be carried on discontinuously. Processes like the one here

at the character of the work being 
done here. He said ne expected to

On January 2, 1906, the Junior Class 
will give a Stag Party to the Plebes. 
This is the first affair of the kind and 
it is hoped that the 1908 men will have

defects, imperfections and waste. A 
determination as fo what constitutes 
this waste is not left with the stu
dent, but in the hands of those who 
are competent to judgethe members 
of your faculty.
The fact, however, that the student 
is incompetent, incapable or lacks 
that continuity of interest and pur
pose which makes for progressive 
development, and likewise gives evi
dence of his inability to pursue the 
studies as outlined, aoes not neces
sarily mean that the student who is 
discarded and. turned into the scrap 
heap is valueless, because in all 
manufacturing establishments, the 
waste or scrap, as well as the de
fective material, has some valuenot 
perhaps for the particular product 
which the manufacturer is endeavor
ing to produce, but to some one who 
can use it. So, every young man who 
fails in these preliminary tests which 
have been exacted by the faculty, has 
some value elsewhere; either in an
other realm of industrial life, in some 
other school, or following another pro
fession. If you want to know what 
value you possess as a discarded indi
vidual, pay a visit to the Secretary 
and the Registrar, both of whom are 
experienced on this subject and will 
give you an honest opinion.
The subject of student control and 
discipline has loomed up large in the 
recent discussions between the fac
ulty and likewise in the councils of 
the student officers.
Student government, like all gov
ernment, must of necessity be the 
average expression of the capacity of 
the individuals to enjoy a particular 
kind of judgment,their government. 
If the average is high and good and 
sound, the government will of neces
sity be likewise. On the whole, I be
lieve the student body of these schools 
should be congratulated on the aver
age of the conduct and the govern
ment now established. Congratulated 
because without precedent, without 
laws previously enacted and without 
rules established by the faculty, the 
larger percentage of you all have con
formed to those fundamental rules of 
conduct which constitute the attri
butes of gentlemen.
There are incidents which, how
ever, prove the exception. The most 
flagrant being that of a student se
lected by the class president to su
pervise in his section. The conduct 
of his particular body of students has, 
by precept and example, been most 
direlict in setting an example as to 
what constitutes manly conduct and. 
attention. This section is designated 
by one of the earliest letters in the 
alphabet. Its officer, representing 
the class president, has been guilty 
of conduct unbecoming a gentleman, 
and has thereby demoralized to a 
very large extent the student control

of that particular section to such an ! 
extent that it is a debatable question 
whether he should not receive sum

other sections, so as to set an example 
in other years to all students who 
may enter this institution.
The subject of Cribbing, like all 
forms of dishonesty, has received very 
careful consideration of both the fac
ulty and the student body during the 
past month. Its prevalence has been 
tested two separate ways; one by stu
dent control, the other by the police 
system. In the judgment of the fac
ulty neither system is entirely satis
factory. It has therefore become 
apparent that some definite plan 
must be suggested by the student 
body to eradicate this pernicious ac
tivity which forms so large a part of 
the student life in most American in
stitutions of learning. Personally, I 
am very much in favor of abandoning 
examinations. They do not justify the 
time, the energy, and the disorgan
ization which they produce; but until 
such time as the faculty is enabled to j 
make personal test of the student 
progress from week to week and 
month to month, reporting deficien
cies as they occur, there does not 
present to us at this time a feasible 
plan for judging of the scholarship 
standing of the student body. Next 
to my personal conviction that the 
examination system is wrong, comes 
my belief that an honor system, based 
upon a pledge in which the students 
agree on their honor not to assist an
other student, would seem to be the 
most effective plan making for hon
esty in examinations.
At an Eastern university a written 
pledge is exacted neither to give nor 
receive information. This pledge is 
frequently violated in spirit, u not 
in letter. This has been caused by 
the assumption that each student will 
pledge himself, without first testing

his unwillingness to do so. In tne 
honor system above suggested, a stu
dent would be protected in giving in
formation by merely replying to the 
request for such information by the 
words I am pledged. It would like
wise make it unnecessary for the stu
dent body to act the part of police 
and spies on their fellow stuaents, 
a disagreeable feature which should 
if possible be eliminated in tests of 
this character. If 90 per cent, of the 
student body refuse to give informa
tion during examinations; only 10 per 
cent, would be afflicted with this per
nicious disease. This would be a 
gain worth recording, and would tra
ditionally fix a standard of conduct as 
applied to scholarship, which would 
undoubtedly produce the required re
sults.
There is , another form of crib
bing not so prevalent, but even more 
distasteful to discuss. This crib
bing is a species of larceny which 
is punishable under the laws of every 
country in the world. It has found 
expression in missing articles of wear, 
such as jewelry and student material. 
Thus far it has been impossible to 
locate the missing articles. It may 
be that the students who have been 
deprived of their possessions accuse 
the Director, the faculty, the school 
officers, the janitors, as well as the 
students themselves. This is a sus
picion which, in my judgment, should 
be instantly removed. There can be 
no question that the honor system 
demands that a student caught in the 
act of taking property not belonging 
to him should be as summarily re
ported as if a total stranger entered 
the premises and committed the dep
redation. If any student says the 
Director or members of the faculty 
committed this offense, we would ap
preciate an immediate public denun
ciation of that individual. If this is 
thoroughly understood, we believe it 
will not be long before the school 
officers and the faculty, as well as 
those students who- are not guilty re
move this unpleasant incident of 
school life.
My remarks thus far have, to a 
very large extent, been of so unpleas
ant a nature that I feel I am scarcely 
justified, in view of the Xmas recess, 
in concentrating so much that is evil, 
without concluding with something 
which is more pleasant and makes 
for more mutual happiness. I there
fore want to wish you all the happi
est Christmas of your lives. I hope 
the two weeks of recreation will be 
spent out-of-doors in healthful exer
cise; indoors reading attractive fic
tion, biography and history, and that 
you will cast aside all thoughts of 
study, and that you will come back
at the conclusion of your recess, re
freshed in mind and body and pre
pared to add to the laurels you have 
already won, or to retrieve those you 
have lost.
It has been my custom to receive 
with Mrs. Hamerschlag on Sunday 
evenings all students in the Junior 
class who find it convenient to call 
at my home, so that I may become 
better acquainted with you all on a 
plane of equality. It has likewise 
been my custom to, from time to time, 
invite those members of the Plebe 
class whose homes are far away. I 
trust that after Xmas every member 
of the Junior class who is interested 
in knowing me as a man and as a 
friend, and desires to see me under 
circumstances different from those in 
School, will find an opportunity to call 
at my residence one Sunday evening 
during  each month, so that we may 
become better friends and more inti
mate, and thereby develop that spirit 
of companionship which I trust will 
live beyond the school period of your 
lives.
I wish you all a Merry Christmas 
and a Happy New Year.

A meeting was called to choose dele

cers to serve during the coming year. 
After securing enough men to hold a 
meeting, three delegates were decided 
on, and these attended the conven
tion of the Association only to learn, 
through Mr. Field, the startling news 
that, according to the constitution, 
they were illegally elected, and the 
only ones having any power to trans
act business were those choseen by 
the student body last year. Business 
was suspended until the constitution 
could be changed. Where was the 
Advisor of the class, that he allowed 
such an error to occur?
1911 has appointed a Marshall to 
make the boys behave during class

a spanking when they dont behave, 
according to Parliamentary rules and 
Cushings Manual.

In a well written article the appear

presses the sentiments of the faithful 
in the matter of the poor attendance 
at class meetings. Mr. Trichler says 
in effect: The members of 1911 who 
neglect to attend the class meetings 
are not getting all the benefits intend
ed, as the meetings are of value, both 
as educational features and as dis
tinct social advantages. Mr. Carnegie 
intended that all the men should get 
all the good there is in the schools, 
and the members' are in gratitude, if 
not by class spirit and loyalty, bound 
to turn out to the class affairs. For

Owing to the absence of a quorum

Mr. J. E. Kirk, of 1911, entertaineda bunch of Techmen on the evening of 
Thursday, Dec. 6. The guests included

that not one of them, not even ex

FELLOTS,
Lets have a little heart to heart talk 
about those leather cushions. We 
believe that the only reason we 
havent received your order is because 
you have never seen our goods. We 
are not trying to sell you a cheap, 
gaudy affair. Never. We are trying 
to sell you a first-class article, to give 
you your moneys worth, because we 
want your future patronage. Were 
young and ambitious, have visions of 
being a Montgomery Ward some time 
in the near future, so we cant afford 
to do you.
Give us a trial order, and we know 
that you wont be disappointed. Here 
is a special offer: A swell hand-made
leather cusion, burnt in original 
"Tech colors for five dollars, and 
your money BACK if you are not sat
isfied. CAN YOU BEAT THAT?

I scanned the scientific page,
Wherein one greatly learned affirms 
That kissing should be quite sup

Because it surely carries germs.
The man is right, I sadly sighed, 
And let him stop it, so he please; 
For, oh, that kiss I stole last night, 
Has given me true hearts disease.
But no, I would not have it stopped, 
Such cure were worse than ill, per

In fact, methinks that what I need 
Is nothing but a great relapse!

Miss McKee, in speaking of the 
slaughtering of cattle says: They

One of the most successful social 
events of the school year was held 
Thursday evening, when one-half of 
the Margaret Morrison entertainmed 
the other half; the girls of the day 
school gave a reception to the girls of 
the night class. And it was a re
ception! All the rooms were gaily 
decorated with flags and pennants and 
plants, presenting a most festive 
scene. The assembly room was clear
ed and waxed for dancing and the 
other rooms were given over to vari-. 
ous fascinations in the shape of Jack 
Horner pies, fish ponds, a fortunetelling tent, and a silhouette gallery. 
The guests were met in the hall by 
the reception committee and given 
cards directing them to either the 
Jack Horner pies or the fish ponds, 
where there were charming favors 
provided for everyone. The making 
of life-size silhouette proved a very 
popular form of entertainment, though 
some of the subjects found difficulty 
in recognizing their own profiles af
terwards. As might be expected from 
a crowd of girls, the fortune teller 
was in great favor too, the only trou
ble being that there was omy one of 
her and a great many girls who 
wanted to know whether He was 
dark or blonde, rich or poor, and how 
soon he might be expected. The glee 
club made its debut and covered itself 
with glory, jf we are to judge by the 
generous applause and complimentary 
criticisms. Supper was served in the 
dining room at ten-thirty, after which 
Good-Night, Ladies, from the glee 
club politely warned the guests that 
lights were off at eleven. Altogether, 
we feel that it is decidedly the best 
we have done yet.
It is queer how the boys scent a 
festivity in the M. M. C. S., and how 
more than eager they are to be num
bered among those present. But then, 
we do not know how to have a good 
time, so we can scarcely blame them.
