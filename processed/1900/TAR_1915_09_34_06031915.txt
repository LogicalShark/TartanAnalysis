TECH SWAMPS
WESTMINSTER
The track team walked away, with 
a farce comedy in the form of a track 
meet at Westminster Saturday, the 
final score resulting 98-33. Westmin
ster secured only two firsts, the ham
mer and the 120 hurdles.
Westminster had a track team of 
only ten men, Buckley, quarter back 
on the football team, and Shields, the 
weight man, being the stars. These 
two won the large majority of the 
points captured by their team.
The closest races were the hurdles, 
Buckley winning by a foot in the 
short distance and Blumenthal win
ing in the 220. In the mile Vincent 
started out to push Reiser hard but 
couldnt keep up the pace.
Tech finished 1st, 2nd and 3rd in 
the quarter. McCracken ran threefourths of the distance with only one 
shoe, a very merry performance. The 
track was full of stones and his foot 
was cut rather badly.
Westminster did not contest the 
relay or pole vault.
Two Tech records were broken, 
Adams in the shot put and Bremmer 
in the road jumps.

(DAMES R. ASH OF LONDON, SPEAKER
COMMENCEMENT 
WEEK IMAM
It is the custom of all institutions, 
colleges, and universities to hold 
some sort of formal celebration and 
rejoicing at the end of each year in 
honor of those of their number, whom 
by reason of having successfully com
pleted a required curriculum of study, 
are about to leave the midst of col
lege activities. The deeper and more 
far-reaching incentive for the origi
nal establishment of such a custom 
was probably not only the idea of 
celebrating the successful completion 
of a period or event in the life of 
the graduate, but the greater idea 
was to give to him an added incen
tive to'begin lifes real work; to give 
to him at this time such impressions 
as might benefit his future career; 
and at the same time leave imprinted 
upon his memory an indelible im
pression of the brighter sides, the 
higher ideals, and the truer friend
ships and relations formed during his 
college days. This is the primary ob
ject of commencement week. An
other purpose intended of this cus
tom is to bring together a number of 
the older graduates whom at one time 
were proud to say, I am a Tech 
student; and to bring together the 
friends and relatives of the graduates 
and to give also to them a pleasant 
entertainment and an everlasting fav
orable impression of our institution.
With these purposes in mind the 
Administrative Council and Class Day 
committee have completed a program 
for the coming week in which they 
have not failed to embody all the 
ideals necessary to make the com
mencement week one which will be 
truly representative of Tech. The 
success of the program cannot be 
doubted, barring the untimely inter
vention of the weather man.
We have been very fortunate in 
securing Mr. Charles R. Ashbee as a 
Commencement speaker. Mr. C. R. 
Ashbee is an architect and director of 
large art industries in London, also 
the author of many books on educa
tion and aesthetics.
At the Commencement exercises an 
honorary degree of Doctor of Let
ters will be conferred upon Mr. Ed
win H. Anderson, director of New 
York Public Library. He was librar
ian of the Carnegie Library of Pitts
burgh, 1895-1904.
The greatest attraction of the week 
from an artistic and spectacular 
standpoint will be the pageant to be
given on Class Day. The pageant 
will consist of masques, one to be 
given by each of the four schools, 
and the leading characters of which 
will be some illustrious character ap
propriate to the particular school. In 
the Industries school, Richard Boul
ton and James Watt are the famous 
men about whom the playlet will be 
built, the parts will be taken by Mr. 
Patterson and Mr. Robinson, of the 
Industries school. Mr. Steen, of the 
Design School, will represent 
Michael Angelo; and the part of 
Queen Margaret will be presented by 
Miss Louise McMillan, of M. M. C.
S. The Science school have built 
their masque about the famous Gilber.
The structure upon which the 
pageant will take place is to consist 
of two stages, one on a higher level 
than the other. The leading charac
ters and the dialogue will be pre
sented on the higher stage, while on 
the lower stage the action will be en
tirely pantomimic in accordance with 
the dialogue taking place on the up
per stage. On one side of the stage 
will be stationed a character repre
senting Wisdom and on the other 
one representing Folly, and the tone 
and action of the masque will also 
be in direct accordance with the ad
vantage gained in the repartee be
tween Wisdom and Folly. The 
pageant is the idea of Mr. Stevens, 
of the Design School and much credit 
is due him for this production, as it 
will go far to make the Class Day 
a success and one long to be re
membered.
Following the new custom intro
duced last year spreads can be 
given in school buildings on Class 
Day this year. The Administrative 
Council has placed at the disposal 
of the Class Day Committee a large 
number of rooms facing on the 
campus.
Any fraternity, sorority, club or 
other organization or group of stu
dents that wish to entertain their 
guests by giving a spread on the 
campus should notify J. J. Cunning
ham not later than June 5th, stating 
which building and room is preferred. 
This idea was carried out success
fully last year, as it is of particular 
benefit to those who do not live near 
the campus. Refreshments will also 
he served at the school restaurant.

PITTSBURGH, PA., JUNE 3, 1915
WHAT THE TARTAN NEEDS.
Several college papers of the coun
try are closing the year asking for 
suggestions from the students for a 
better paper during the next season. 
This is an excellent idea; The Tar
tan is going to try it out. No doubt, 
there are many students in the Insti
tute who could point out faults in the 
paper that could be remedied; there 
may be fields which we are. failing to 
cover, we may be covering some of 
them too closely, we may be making 
repeated mistakes in still other fields 
which we are covering; we may not 
be running as many features as we 
should.
The proportionate news values as
signed the reports that come in from 
various fields, depend upon the tastes 
of the half dozen men who have in 
charge of the news policy of The 
Tartan. While there is a probability 
that they are getting the required at
tention, they will certainly go wrong 
in some instances.
If we could get fifty or one hundred 
suggestions from the students, the 
chances are that we would get some 
new ideas on what the students ex
pect of their college news publicatio. 
Either drop them in the mail box in 
the Central Building or in the Tartan 
boxes. You should be interested 
enough to tell us about our mistakes 
now while you have a chance, and not 
'knock when it is too late, and why 
shouldnt you, for it is yours, not ours?
FINE POINTS OF HONOR.
The article below appeared in The 
Case Tech, where conditions are 
similar to our own:
"There has been, from time to time, 
more or less agitation in Case about 
the honor system, but nothing definite 
has ever been done by the School as 
a whole. To any person who might 
see life at Case from an exterior 
standpoint, there is one particular 
point of honor which would be very 
strongly presented.
"The greater portion of the work at 
Case consists in the solution of prob
lems correctly. Suppose the honor 
system were introduced. What would 
become of the men who, day after 
day, make a practice of obtaining 
problem solutions from their brighter 
or more industrious classmates?
Is not the question of borrowing 
a mans work openly outside of the 
classroom as important as the ques
tion of borrowing work underhandedly inside? If the men in some one 
section were prevented from exchang
ing work for one semester, the per
centage of failures v>ould undoubted
ly increase by half, or else, due to 
the increased effort necessitated, the 
men would have a much better indi
vidual knowledge of the subject.
Think, when you copy a problem, 
if you are not doing yourself an in
justice. If a man is willing to give 
his work away, that is his own look
out. The dishonor lies in the cribbers injustice to himself.
With this in view the instructors 
cannot be blamed for giving hard ex
aminations, and, as everyone who has 
tried it knows, this is the final reck
oning.
The fact that cribbing does exist in 
our school as well as in all schools 
should be an incentive for us to make 
it a point individually to put a 
stop to it. Consider two things 
first, that is injurious to the one who 
does it; second, that it will lower the 
possible working standards of the 
school.
In this age of competition, the im
portant thing is not the obtaining of 
a good position, but the ability to 
make good after the position has 
been acquired. The person who de
pends upon others to finish college 
lacks the vself-confidence and the-initia
tive which are important factors in 
the acquisition of success.
We have at present in the Science 
School a set of rules governing the 
same as above, but they seem to be 
used on only few occasions; they are 
not universal. What good are they 
if just a few use them? That, of 
course, lets the conscience of a few 
remain free, but what about the stand
ards of Carnegie?
MEMORIAL DAY.
As the long line of parade passes 
with pomps and suavity through the 
streets of our premier city, the out
ward glitter is so apparent and the 
music so inspiring that we seldom 
tHnk farther than the circle of our 
daily lives,except perhaps as a cheer 
lifts into the air and every mans 
hat comes off as the Civil War vet
erans, our betters, pass by.
If we were to desire to substitute 
for Memorial Day a name which
might, in a few respects, be more 
fitting, a better one than Inheritance 
Day could not be round. Inheri
tance Day because we, as a body of 
students, at last realize that without 
distinction of nationality, of race or 
of religion, the members of the Grand 
Army of the Republic and the Con
federacy gave all that the heart 
holds precious for our country. 
I hrotigh such a sacrifice of home, 
health and immediate reward, you and 
I are born free to wedge our way into 
the commercial world unchecked by 
the bonds of servity. Free to enjoy 
and be led by such a religion as we 
may choose, free to enjoy the unre
strained cast of ballot, and at liberty 
to do as we may, bounded only by 
the restraint, which should be a de
sire, to regard and obey the law of 
equal rights. But we realize that we 
cannot live in associations with the 
past alone, and if we would be worthy 
of the past, we must find new fields 
for thought and action and make for 
ourselves new careers.
G. A. C.
SCHOOL PICNIC.
Many of the Tech students quite 
lost the remembrances of Memorial 
Day while enjoying the revels of TE 
picnic which proved to be without 
exception the most enjoyable one ever 
held by that body. True enough, we 
missed the entertainment of the Tech 
Band" and could they, in turn, have 
caught a glimpse of the charming 
summers day and had they but taken 
the chance of ducking a few showers, 
which seemed apparent but which all 
vanished when Old Sol held sway, the 
pleasure upon their part and the en
tertainment upon ours would have 
been keener. Such occasions as Mon
days picnic are truly lifesavers for 
they take one into a most beautiful 
scenic country and bring him face to 
face with nature and natures charm.
Those students who secured early 
railway tickets at Bursars office for 
the picnic grounds, were greatly in
convenienced by the apparent incon
sideration of the parties in charge. 
Not only was the special train for the 
picnic grounds cancelled, without any 
notice to those who held tickets there
on, but the special-rate tickets sold 
at the Administration Building were, 
in many cases, void because of its 
latent date.
CONGRATULATIONS.
The Tartan wishes to congratulate 
Mr. Dunseith on his election to cap
taincy of the track team for the com
ing year. During this and last sea
son his has been a major part in the 
success of that sport, most especially 
in his work on the relay team. We 
wish Mr. Dunseith the best of suc
cess and feel that his election increas
es our assurance that we will be rep
resented by an unrivaled track team 
next season.

SUMMER MILITARY CAMPS.
To Students who are thinking of 
attending the Summer Military 
Instruction Camps:
My attention was called to a news
paper note from Washington published 
some days ago to the effect that the 
student camps for this summer might 
not be held owing to the refusal of 
the Comptroller of the Treasury to 
approve certain expense accounts in 
connection with the camps held last 
year. I was sure there was some error 
in the report and I am glad to have 
this morning from General Wood a 
letter dated May 25 advising me that 
the camps are to go on in this eastern 
department, so that any students who 
have filed applications for the New 
York Plattsburg Camp need not ap
prehend any disappointment.
Henry S. Drinker.
May 27, 1915.
May 27, 1915. 
My dear Dr. Hamerschlag:
A report started by an article in 
the Washington Post has been going 
the rounds to the effect that, owing 
to the refusal of the Comptroller of 
the Treasury to approve certain ac
counts relating to the Students Sum
mer Military Gunps, the camps would 
not be held this year. I did not be
lieve that General Wood would so 
lightly give up the camps as he has 
been vigorously pushing them this 
spring, and I have from him this 
morning a letter sayrng: The camps
are all right in this Department and 
I think elsewhere.
We had the pleasure of having Gen
eral Wood here recently to address the 
rtudent body on the camps and he 
then said to me that the prospects 
were exceedingly good for the Plattsbnrg Camp particularly and from what 
I have heard of probable attendance at 
the Ludington Camp I think that will 
be largely attended. I am not so well 
informed as to the Chickamauga and 
Monterey Camps.
I am enclosing copy of a notice 
that I am today posting to our stu
dent body.
Sincerely yours,
H. S. Drinker.

THE PLAYS THE THING.
Mr. Frederic McConnell is one of 
the men whose work has been fol
lowed with interest through the sea
son. His Bellman in The Be
trayal, was the live wire in that 
sombre production. He raised the 
character to first importance in that 
it remains salient in the memory 
while the others only blend into the 
general gloom pervading the play.
The Much Ado About Nothing, 
he carried successfully two widely 
diverging rolesBalthazar and neigh
bor Verges. His Hey nouny, 
nouny, made him many friends, 
among those who love the singing 
actor, and the ability to do his own 
serenading will stand him in good 
stead in days to come. His voice 
lends itself with wonderful ease to 
the quavering accents of a good 
old man, sir (Verges) which char
acter was as cleverly done, as re
gards make-up and interpretation as 
anything in the entire seasons offer
ing.
He has a rather staccato delivery 
which made itself unpleasantly felt in 
the reading of his lines as the Herds
man in Iphegina, and at times in 
Fillipo in Coppees Violin Maker.
His physique is bound to limit him, 
but he has been well cast throughout 
the season and evinced a versatile 
talent and thoughtful work. One 
feels that Mr. McConnell has not 
spared himself in the effort to make 
good whether the part was a small 
or a large one.
Miss Doris Williams is another 
known quantityone feels pretty 
certain of what she will do. The 
charm of her Julia in The Two 
Gentlemen of Verona has not been 
effaced by any later work. In Iphe
gina she proved her ability to carry 
through a heavy role. Miss Williams 
is, before all else, an elocutionist; 
how she gives her lines, is to her of 
first importance and she porceeds 
with a certain deliberation and assur
ance coupled with a precision of de
livery that leaves her audience in no 
doubt as to what she is saying. Be
cause of this she scored heavily in 
the character of Athena, speaking 
as one with authority as becomes so 
great a goddess. Her Gloria Clandon, in Shaws play, conveyed the 
impression of a rather hard, deter
mined nature, whose final capitula
tion to the little blind god, in the 
person of Mr. Valentine, left her 
audience skeptical as to the sincer
ity of her conversion.
Mr. Theodore Viehman has done 
some very creditable work as Ezra 
Williams in Neighbors, Finch 
McComas (You Never Can Tell) 
and Leonarto in Much Ado. His 
Finch McComas had about it just 
a suggestion, in manner and deliv
ery, of Prof. Higginsthe profes
sor of phonetics in Pygmalion 
given at the Nixon this season.
Mr. Norwood Engles Don John 
was one of the things very well done 
in Much Ado. The lines were es
pecially well read, and he succeeded 
in bringing out the villiany of the 
character without falling into the 
melo-dramatic.
Mr. Harlold Munnis gave a good 
account of himself as Philip Clandon (You Never Can Tell) a 
character type in which he was espe
cially well cast, having the youth 
and aplomb necessary to the success
ful carrying out of the role. His 
Michel Dara (The Shadow of the 
Glen) had about it too much of the 
odor of the town youth and none of 
that mysterious loneliness which so 
permeates this play. As Benedick, 
in Much Ado, his work was care
fully and cleverly done. The question 
iswhat is ones idea of Benedick. 
He makes of this character what a 
certain novelist would term, a jaunty 
dog, while the rush into the melo
dramatic, in the scene between Bea
trice and Benedick (somewhat hys
terical on the part of both) seemed 
out of balance with the rest of their 
work, but as Claudio saylet every 
eye negotiate for itself and trust no 
agent.
Miss Mary Blair as Beatrice pre
sented herself from quite a new angle 
and interpreted the role without un
due hardness and with considerable 
brilliancy. Her enunciation was bet
ter than usual; she is apt, at times 
to smother in her own eloquence.
Her first effort Fedelm (The 
Kings Threshold) is still fresh ' in 
mind and the best thing she has 
done, for here she found scope for 
that emotional abandon, which is 
part of her heritage; her voice is 
warm and caressing when she 
chooses. She is the one who appears 
to possess those elements from which 
the tragedienne might be expected 
to develop. One felt her latent pow
er to move an audience in her Iphegenia. She gave a very human 
interpretation of Shaws Gloria 
Clandon.

LAST ASSEMBLY FOR SENIORS.
Last Tuesday a week was the last 
assembly which the Seniors will at
tend in a body, as students of the Mar
garet Morrison Carnegie School. The 
rest of the girls were assembled and 
stood singing the Womans Song, 
while the Seniors marched in, and took 
their places in the frant rows.
Dean Breed announced the winners 
of the two scholarships offered in the 
school. One, given by the M. M. C. S. 
Alumnae, goes to Miss Ruth Pontius, 
16. We wish her all luck and con
gratulate the donors on their choice, 
for we are sure Ruth will, by a suc
cessful life, repay a thousand times the 
honor done her. The other scholar
ship was awarded to Miss Sara Wolfe, 
16. This was given fty the Alumnae 
Association of the Female College of 
Pittsburgh. This body of women is 
unique in no longer having a college 
but in still maintaining its alumnae 
association which is till actively in
terested in educational problems of the 
day. This scholarship of $75 was to 
be given to the Junior or Senior ac
quiring the greatest number of grades 
above credit. Miss Wolfe and Miss 
Mary Ride, 16, tied in this respe.ct, 
each securing 17, but, it was that, be
cause of the greater number of credits 
Miss Wolfe was carrying, it was more 
of an achievement on her part, and 
so the scholarship was given to her. 
M. M. C. S. and especially the Junior 
class is to be congratulated on having 
two such brilliant girls in their midst. 
May it be an incentive to the others 
to go and do likewise.
Dean Breed then gave a short, but 
impressive talk concerning our future 
outlook on life and what we have so 
far accomplished. She urged us to 
stop for a moment and search our
selves, asking how much we have 
gained, besides knowledge, since our 
entrance into M. M. C. S. Has the 
time spent been worth while, and has 
our development CH character kept 
pace with our acquirement of knowl
edge?
She also urged the Junior class to 
do their utmost to maintain the stand
ard set for them by the class of 1915. 
Dean Breed closed by wishing success 
and advancement to every member of 
the Senior class and expressed her cer
tainty that each would be a credit to 
her Alma Mater.
The Seniors then sang their Fare
well, Alma Mater, and marched out 
while the other girls remained stand
ing. This last assembly stirred us all, 
but perhaps the upperclassmen more 
than any. The Seniors because of the 
uncertainty of the future and of the 
departing from a school which has 
meant an increasing amount to them 
every year. There have been trials 
and troubles, but these are soon for
gotten and only the pleasant things 
remain, as one looks back over the 
four short years. It, however, is not 
all sadness but one looks out on the 
world with joyful anticipation in spite 
of the regretful looks behind. For the
Juniors, too, it is a time of deep think
ing. First of all foi the responsibili
ties falling upon one as a Senior and 
for the standards one must maintain 
to hope to reach the required height. 
Then, most of all perhaps, for the 
breaking of the ties which have been 
formed with the Senior class. For it 
is hard to see ones friends go out, 
and to face the necessity of looking 
forward to a year which they will not 
share in every particular as before. 
However, we hope the best for every 
girl graduate. May she attain the high
est success in whatever she under
takes and reflect nothing but good on 
her Alma Mater.
DUCKY PRICE, PRESIDENT 
OF THE STUDENT 
ASSEMBLY.
Ducky Price, president of the 
Student Assembly, for 1913-1914, was 
a visitor in our midst early this week. 
Ducky looked like a young million
aire and we were certainly glad to 
have him with us the few days he 
spent with old Tech.
Wilbur Monks, 14, the lightning 
pattern-maker who makes a five
armed wheel in about four minutes, 
according to Industries at Work, 
also spent Tuesday morning renew
ing old acquaintances about school.
DR. DAY LEAVES FOR WAR.
Commissioned a major of cavalry 
in the Canadian volunter forces a 
short time ago, Frank P. Day, pro
fessor of literature in the Margaret 
Morrison School, left Pittsburgh last 
week for the Quebec concentration 
camp, where he will join his com
mand.
Major Day is a Canadian by birth 
and has had previous military train
ing, which accounts for the high rank 
to which he was commissioned on 
offering his services this spring. He 
was formerly a captain in a Nova 
Scotia cavalry organization. He 
probably will be sent to France with 
the next Canadian over-seas expe
ditionary force.
Fighting Germans will recall to 
Major Day a portion of his life spent 
in Berlin immediately after the com
pletion of his education. In 1908 he 
went from Oxford, where he had re
ceived his A. B., to Berlin to become 
an assistant in the Englisches Semi
nar of the university there. He was 
in Berlin only a year, going from 
there back to England to become in
structor in English in Bristol.
Prof. Day was one of the first to 
hold a Rhodes scholarship. He com
pleted the three-year course in Ox
ford University, which it provides 
in two years. His undergraduate 
work was taken in Mt. Allison Col
lege, in Nova Scotia. He received 
his masters degree from Oxford in 
1912.
COMMENCEMENT INVITA
TIONS.
The seniors can secure their Com
mencement invitations now by call
ing at the Registrars Office. M. M.
C. S. seniors should call at the Gen
eral Office in their own building. The 
Registrars Office will be open Mon
day evening, June 7th, from 7:30 to 
8:30 for night graduates who may 
wish to get more invitations.
Each undergraduate can secure, 
without expense, one Commencement 
invitation, and three Class Day tick
ets by calling at the Registrars Of
fice.
In order that all classes, under
graduates, as well as seniors, may be 
fully represented on the important oc
casion of the Commencement, every 
student is expected to be present at 
the exercises in Carnegie Music Hall 
on Friday morning, June 11th, at ten 
oclock.
The classes will assemble in front 
of the Industries Building at 9:30 and 
will march to Music Hall in the fol
lowing order: Faculty, Alumni and
Alumnae, Seniors, undergraduates.
ALUMNI NEWS.
The New Castle News prints the 
following:
The Highland Avenue home of 
George W. Lamoree was the scene 
of genuine pleasure and real New 
Castle hospitality when Mr. and Mrs. 
Lamoree entertained the Mahoning 
and Shenango chapter o? the Alumni 
association of the Carnegie Institute 
of Technology.
The occasion was the spring meet
ing of the local organization. Nine
teen members were present.
Regular business was transacted 
by the assembly during the first part 
of the evening. Action upon the new 
constitution of the mother association 
was one of the important subjects 
considered. Plans were formulated 
for the entertainment of prominent 
men in the steel and iron industry. It 
being the intention to introduce wellknown speakers at future meetings.
Officers for the coming year were 
elected. The result follows: Presi

APPLIED INDUSTRIES
STUDENT ASSEMBLY ELEC
TIONS.
Wednesday, May 27tli, the third 
annual election of officers for the Stu
dent Assembly of the Industries 
School was held. Several candidates 
were nominated for each office, the 
votes in several instances almost be
ing tied. Carl F. Peters, 16, nomin
ated under open nominations, suc
ceeded D. P. Murphy, 15, to the pre
sidency with Walter Gloekler and M. 
Murphy as rival candidates for the 
office. Patterson, a Plebe, was elect
ed to the vice-presidency, while 
Kingsbury, 16, recently made man
ager of the Tech Band for next year, 
succeeded to the office of Secretary, 
held for the past two years by the 
president-elect, J. M. Moore, 16 track 
man and winner of the third scholar
ship offered Plebes, was elected 
Treasurer which position was held by 
Beinon, now graduating.
The new officers are as follows: 
PresidentCarl F. Peters, 16, New 
York, N. Y.
Vice PresidentH. R. Patterson, 17, 
Brownsville, Pa.
SecretaryO. D. Kingsbury, 16, Os
age, Iowa.
TreasurerJ. M. Moore, 16, of Pitts
burgh.
The graduating members certainly 
had a splendid opportunity to air 
themselves at the last Assembly meet
ing of the year. Adamson, Vernon, 
Bushong, Sweeney, Parsons and sev
eral others all spoke of the swell 
times they had during their stop-off 
at Tech. Each one paid splendid trib
utes to the school and its use in the 
athletic and the activity circles of the 
combined schools.
Young Murphy read the yearly re
port of the Club Room Committees 
work at the recent Assembly, which 
report showed how well that commit
tee did its duty toward keeping the 
clubroom in proper order.
Dean Connelley wfote a letter com
menting on the splendid success of 
Letter Day. Over three hundred 
letters were written by Industries stu
dents.
Pattersons talk on the pageant 
brought him up before the student 
body for the first time and his abil
ity to clearly set forth the plans for 
the Class Day exercises, we believe, 
won for him the election to the vice
presidency.
As to the Hamerschlag trophy re
garding which there has been much 
discussion, it has been found that far 
back in 1910, this was won by the 
Science School for the third time. 
Under the conditions then existing, 
the trophy was offered as a perma
nent possession to the school win
ning it three times. Since 1910 Sci
ence has won it each year, or, at 
least, the greatest number of times. 
This year a new condition presented 
itself. Industries won the athletic 
contest for the first time and when it 
came to getting the trophy over to 
our school we found there was no 
trophy to get. Upon explaining the 
matter to the Director and after sub
sequent investigation, he has very 
kindly offered another trophy to be 
contested for annually beginning 
with the last inter-school meet held 
April 17th in which Industries won 
handsomely. This should clear up 
the minds of all. Let us hope the 
new trophy becomes ours.

Wednesday evening. May 19th, the 
baby organization of Industries, The 
Avo Club, held another of its success
ful social affairs in the electric shop. 
The smoker opened with selections 
by an orchestra specially imported 
for the occasion. Band Manager 
Gumbart, with traps and stove kettle 
drums, sounded the Reveille and the 
siege was on. Kingsbury, cornet; 
Martin (Design student in Rests) 
trombone, recently from Gallingers; 
Kintz, violin, and Peters piano, com
pleted the noise committee. Short 
and snappy then talks followed by 
Professors Morris and Calderwood 
and Mr. Ward of the Duquesne Light 
Company.
The next number introduced for the 
first and last time the famous and 
mysterious Avograph, the subject of 
its titular scintillations being A 
Short Circuited Romance. The 
scenario, especially written for the oc
casion. was staged and acted by Avoists and gathered deadening applause 
from the onlookers. Baldy Coulters 
picture at the age of twenty-one cre
ated untold laughter. The picture 
had some excuse in that photography 
was highly undeveloped when the sit
ting was taken. Sox Price, the ubiquitious (look it up) Jew monologist 
slung equatorial emanations at sev
eral of those present. Cost, Solomon 
and Sweeney rendered string music 
which helped along the occasion while 
Martin blew a solo with his trombone 
to top off the evening. Following the 
eats, of which there were many and 
well selected, the elections for next 
year were held at which Kingsbury 
and Cost were elected chief trouble
chaser and complaint registrar re
spectively.
RESULTS OF MEDICAL EXAM.
The results of the Spring Medical 
and Physical examinations taking in
to consideration only questions of 
condition and weight of the Plebe 
class at the Carnegie Institute of 
Technology shows as per tables ap
pended, a remarkable similarity in 
the percentage of gain and loss in 
weight for the Schools of Applied 
Design and Industries, a slight ad
vantage in condition and a decided 
disadvantage in loss of weight for 
the School of Applied Sciences. Spec
ulations as to the Why? of the 
latter would lead one far. Whereas 
one might advance that the strenu
ous mental work of the Science stu
dent accounts for the loss in weight, 
another might rightfully claim that 
the less regular and more depleting 
work of the Applied Design student 
should bring equally bad or worse 
results. Both arguments are equally 
valid and equally worthless as far as 
conviction carrying powers go and 
we shall merely mention the facts as 
they are without advancing any the
ories to explain them. Stating, how
ever, our firm conviction that when 
complete co-operation between stu
dent and health authorities is fully 
established, the registration of losses 
either in condition or in weight will 
be much less marked.

Consideration of the quality of 
cases of ill health reported to and 
advised by the School Physician dur
ing the year 1914-1915, we find the 
following instructive percentages. 
Conditions of Respiratory

Contusions, sprains, etc.25.5 per cent
Boils and Abcesses.......15.5 per cent
Digestive Tract ............9.5 per cent

A total of 91.6 per cent for condi
tions some of which:
Contusions ....25.5 per cent

are not susceptible of prevention by 
hygienic measures, but leaving 59.8 
per cent for illnesses which are pre
ventable and should not obtain if 
proper precautions, adequate rest and 
elementary prophylactic measures 
known to everybody were taken.
Where the student body will real
ize that the medical profession dis
counts more and more the use and 
value of drugs and places more and 
more reliance upon sound dietetic 
and hygiene measures to either pro
mote or preserve health, it will ap
preciate the quality of the principles 
which we try to inculcate and be as
tonished at the results which preven
tion through resistance will enable 
us to bring to its attention.

DESIGN SCHOOL NOTES
PLEBE PROBLEM.
The Plebes turned in their final 
problem of last Saturday. The prob
lem itself was quite analogous to the 
last Class B Order Problem, being 
the plan and section of a small chapel. 
Many interesting problems resulted.
SENIORS.
As this is the final issue of the Tar
tan, it seems no more than fitting to 
say that next year we shall miss the 
group of this year Seniors in the 
upper end of the drafting room, but 
as apparent as they are today, next 
year they will be of the past, and a 
new class will be fitting themselves 
into their places.
AS YOU LIKE IT.
Tuesday night was Student Night 
for the Shakespearian play, As \ ou 
Like It. The performance was given 
on the Design School terrace, which 
is fast becoming a v^ry popular stage.
FREEHAND.
The Freehand Room is again resum
ing its popularity. Many charetters 
seem to be in evidence, trying to fin
ish one year's work in two weeks; or 
perhaps trying to encourage some 
damsel of the fairer sex with her 
work.
I wonder what some of the ladyfussers will do when the Dramatic De
partment finally quits school for the 
summer?
Pink Spiegel seems to have lost 
a lot of his hominy", but Red Trent 
is still delivering the goods.
In reviewing the past year we find 
that Pribeck has made great strides 
toward becoming a rational human 
being.
I wonder where Smith is wearing 
his T. A. C. pin now?
Mr. James L. Payne, Design Presi
dent of the class of '18, left Tuesday, 
May 24, for Savannah, Ga where he 
will spend the summer. Mr. Payne 
is to have charge of the construction 
of one of Savananhs largest buildings 
and was compelled M>y virtue of this 
requirement to leave for the South at 
once.
The class of 18 will never have a 
president who can so completely win 
the support and good will of each 
individual class member, as Mr. Payne 
has done. He has been an excellent 
officer, an energetic student and has 
exemplified the tru spirit of Tech 
brotherhood to its fullest degree.
The American Institute of Archi
tects offers this year and will here
after offer annually a medal to each 
of the principal American schools of 
architecture to be awarded by each
to that member of itrf graduating class 
whose work as a whole during his en
tire course is deemed most excellent 
by its faculty. In order that our fac
ulty may be able to view every year 
the work of the grauating class as a 
whole it will be necessary for the stu
dents to assemble and present for con
sideration all of their work in design 
and drawing of ever/ kind. The stu
dents are therefore urged to keep all 
of their work in good condition in 
come place where it may easily be 
collected and presented for considera
tion at the end of their course.
May 17, 1915.
ANNOUNCEMENT OF SUMMER 
COURSES.
Department of Architecture.
Due to an arrangement with Mr. 
Sternfeld the Department of Archi
tecture is prepared to offer some sum
mer classes during about six weeks 
from the first of August. Details of 
the arrangement will be mentioned 
later. At present we can announce 
that Mr. Sternfeld will give instruc
tion in architectural drawing Class D, 
Order Problems Class C, Plan Prob
lems, Class B, Measured Drawing, 
Class B, summer Archaeology Project 
Class A. The fee for registration in 
the class will be $10.00. The work in 
design will be rated and credited for 
graduation according to the same val
ues as during the regular school year, 
provided it meets the same standards, 
so that students have an opportunity 
in this class to make up lost work 
and to gain some credits in advance 
toward graduation.
Students who are likely to register 
in this class are requested to leave 
their names with Mr. McGoodwin as 
soon as possible.
This arrangement is for the next 
summer only and is not permanent.
HEWLETT PRIZE.
Upon his death, Dean Hewlett left 
a certain amount of money which was 
to be given yearly in the form of a fel
lowship to some student of the School 
of Applied Design. The particulars 
concerning this fellowship are as fol
lows:
April 23rd, 1915.
To the Faculty of the
School of Applied Design,
Carnegie Instituie of Technology.
The undersigned committee, having 
been asked to consider the conditions 
under which the Russell Hewlett Mamorial Fellowship should be awarded, 
have formulated the following sug
gestions:
The conditions of artistic training 
in this country at the present time are 
in our judgment defective mainly on 
account of a failure to properly co
ordinate all conditions of successful 
production obtaining in the various 
crafts.
Our suggestion is, therefore, that 
a committee should be appointed to 
make a selection of a craftsman of 
considerable maturity and experience 
in some one of the artistic crafts who
has not enjoyed the advantages of ar
tistic education. Thys student should 
be offered free tuition in the School 
of Applied Design for one year and 
a sufficient amount in cash to defray 
his living expenses.
The points of primary importance 
in the selection should be,first, seri
ous purpose in his effort to develop 
himself in some line of decorative art; 
second, a sufficient familiarity with 
the technique and processes of the 
particular craft that he has been prac
tising to enable him to bring into the 
school, both in his associations with 
the faculty and students, the distinct 
point of view of the craftsman as op
posed to that of the Artist.
Our reason for recommending that 
the selection of the recipient of this 
fellowship should be by direct selec
tion rather than by any form of com
petition is that we regard it as most 
important that serious purpose and 
sincere desire for educational oppor
tunities upon the artistic side should 
be the primary consideration and there 
seems no way possible to guard com
petition publicly announced against 
the entrance of certain candidates who 
might prove undesirable from this 
point of view. A consideration which 
seems to vis of importance in this con
nection is the possibility that by the 
method proposed the school will be 
putting itself into a position to de
velop future members of its own fac
ulty who will become available as it 
becomes possible to extend the 
courses into new fields of applied art.

A MUSICAL CLUBS OFFER.
At a recent meeting of the executive 
committee of the Musical Clubs a plan 
for obtaining new concerts for the 
clubs was adopted. This plan was sug
gested by the ex-manager. In brief, 
it is this:
Any man who, by his own personal 
work and with the Approval of the 
manager, obtains a profitable concert 
at a place where the clubs have never 
given a concert, will be given a com
mission of five dollars. It was deemed 
advisable to adopt this plan on the 
grounds that it gives the clubs a broad
er field and stimulates in outside men 
more interest in the clubs.

The Sophomores of the Science 
School annexed another victory to 
their list by defeating the Juniors in 
a rather loosely played game. Tyler, 
who was in the box for the Juniors, 
was hit freely. Addison pitched a good 
game for the Sophs, since he held 
his opponents to five scattered hits. 
The Juniors secured their only run in 
the fifth, when Gower stole home. The 
umpire who failed to see Kennedy re
tire the runner at home, gave the Jun
iors the best of the decision for he 
did not want to see them go home with 
a bunch of goose eggs to their credit. 
Below is an account of game:

The Soph. Electricals took a little 
of that superior feeling from the Jun

the game was the one-handed catch of

INDEPENDENTS TIE TECH.
Rally In The Ninth Evens Up Score.
In a long, drawn-out, most disinteresting game Carnegie Tech and the 
Pittsburgh Independents battled into 
the extra innings to try to break up 
a tie. Umpire Eckles was forced to 
call the game, however, as it was be
ginning to get dark. Tech leaned all 
over the ball in the third and four 
runs were netted in this inning. The 
visitors scored one in their half of the 
third and again in th^; fifth scored two 
more. A double by Keller was the 
chief cause of the scores. Tech made 
one in this inning wnd three in the 
sixth. This ended the Plaids scoring. 
LTnfortunately the visitors hit Cos
grove hard in the seventh and made 
three tallies. In the ninth, after our 
opponents had got a nice little rally 
going and scored twice, Wean was 
called upon to put a stop to the vis
itors fun. Both teams failed to score 
in the tenth. By that time the fielders 
could hardly see the ball and Eckles 
called the contest. Cosgrove started 
the twirling for Tech and did well, 
considering that it was his first game. 
His two nice fat singles helped along
nrettv well, also.Theboxscore:

TECH TAKES RELAY FROM 
PITT AND W. & J. TRACK 
MEN ALSO GET MED
ALS IN OTHER 
EVENTS.
Running against W. & J. and Pitt, 
the Tech relay team won an exciting 
contest at the Crafton meet Monday 
afternoon. The rivalry between the 
three institutions was intense and re
sulted in the prettiest relay race seen 
in this district this season. W. & J. 
was badly outclassed.
Cary started for Carnegie running 
against Canan of Pitt. The Tech man 
took the lead at the start and ran a 
very pretty ract finishing ahead by 
two yards. Findlay doubled this lead 
against Thomas but by hard sprint
ing Mays lowered Techs lead to a 
yard with Dunseith running as our 
third man. For the whole lap Rieser 
and Gnmbling of Pitt fought for first 
pace, Pitt leading for the first time 
for part of the lap. But Reiser drew 
ahead at the three-quarter mark and 
retained the lead to the finish though 
at the last Grumbling drew up until 
scarcely half a foot separated the two 
runners. W. & J. dropped behind at 
the first lap and never drew closer 
to the leaders.
Individual cups were awarded each 
member of the winning team and the 
large cup donated by the Crafton mer
chants comes to Tech for a year. This 
cup had previously been won twice in 
succession by W. & J. who would have 
obtained permanent possession on the 
third consecutive win.
The relay totaled 1 1-3 miles, be
ing 587 yards to the Tap. The track 
was very muddy at the turns and pre
vented very fast time.
Hemann took first in the 100 for 
colleges, the 100-yard handicap and 
2nd in the 220 handicap. Blumenthal 
also took 3rd in this event. Hemanns 
time in the 100 was 10 1-5.
Brenner took 2nd in the handicap 
running broad and Mitchel, competing 
unattached, took second in the handi
cap pole vault. King and Murphy 
former Tech stars took 1st and 2nd 
in the high jump, both being scratch 
men,

gether at the plate the impact forced 
the ball out of the catchers hand. 
Nevertheless the play itself was a 
pretty one. Krum had a little hard 
luck, when, in the ninth inning he 
sprained his ankle in going back to 
first after Englehart had made a pretty 
catch of Hines bid for a two-bagger. 
The injury was but slight, however, 
and he played in last Wednesdays 
game with Pittsburgh Independents. 
The box score:
Tech Holds Opponents To a 4 to 2 
Score.
On Tuesday, May 25th, the ball team 
nlayed the second game of the season 
with the University of Pittsburgh nine 
and a better exhibition of baseball 
could not have been looked for. The 
game was more of a pitching battle 
than anything else. Both Hines and 
Hart did some pretty twirling. But 
both pitchers had their bad innings. 
The Blue and Gold batters treated 
Hines badly in the second inning, and 
a couple of singles, coupled with a 
triple by Peck and a base on balls 
practically spelled victory for the op
ponents. Three men scored in this 
inning.
Hart did good work until the eighth, 
when he became a little wild and 
wplt'cd Oeffinger, Kesner reached first 
on Pecks error and Lain also drew a 
walk. Kreider roled one to Hart, who 
forced out Oeffinger at the plate. 
Humphries double came at exactly 
the right moment an<l as a result both 
Kesner and Lain crossed the pan. 
Kreider tried to score also and was 
nut out in the attempt. McClure 
fanned.
Tn the ninth Healy found Hines for 
a double, and scored on a single by 
Peck.
The game was quite a surprise to 
the spectators and the team certainly 
deserves a lot of credit for the game 
they put up. Not only was it a pitch
ers duel, but also an exhibition of 
rome fast fielding by both teams. 
With Morrow on first and Matson on 
third Pitt tried a double steal. Lain 
made a quick throw to Doherty, who 
TPnpcd it right back to the catcher.
