$1,000,000 APPROPRIATION HAS BEEN RECEIVED BY TRUSTEES
A Part Will Be Used To Finish Science School and To 
Open Morewood Entrance
MONEY FOR THE MUSEUM
At a meeting of the board of trus
tees of the Carnegie Institute last 
week it was announced that the 
Carnegie Corporation has appropriat
ed $400,000 for additional buildings 
at Tech, and $556,000 for additional 
endowment. The Carnegie Corpora
tion of New York is the body which 
has Mr. Carnegie's gifts in its charge. 
Their appropriation this year com
pletes an agreement made three 
years ago, by which the trustees 
agreed to increase the student body 
by 200 students a year for three 
years if they should receive $1,200,- 
000 for buildings and $1,556,000 for 
endowment. This has, of course, 
been done, since the figures an
nounced in The Tartan last week 
place the registration at 3,628 as 
compared with 3,000 three years ago. 
The final installment of $400,000 for 
buildings received this year is to be 
used for the erection of the new 
head house for the Science School. 
This head house will contain the 
main offices, a lecture room, and 
drafting rooms. In addition it is 
planned to open Morewood avenue 
through to Forbes street immediate
ly, and thus complete a project which 
has been hoped for for several years.
In addition to the appropriations 
for the school, the trustees received 
this - year $52,500 for the museum, 
fine arts department, and librarians 
school, and $30,000 for contingent ex
penses. This money is to be used 
for needed additions and enlarge
ments in the various departments, 
including repairs to the great organ 
in the Music Hall. These four ap
propriations for the year total $1,- 
038,500, which brings Mr. Carnegies 
gifts to the entire Institute to $28,- 
000,000.

Spring is Tennis Manager and 
Vernon Football Manager.
The regular meeting of the Board 
of Control was held in Dr. Esquerres 
office on December 6, arid was at
tended by ten out of the twelve 
members.
The most important action of this 
meeting was the re-election of J. H. 
Gearhart for Graduate Manager of 
Athletics' for the next year. R. W. 
Spring Design, 18,. was elected tennis 
manager.
Manager Tom Orr was present 
and gave a resume of 1916 football 
season. He also spoke highly of the 
assistance of Vernon as assistant 
manager and also recommended four 
men for first assistants for next 
year. A vote was taken and Ver

the coming year. Orr also spoke on 
the necessity of having two first as
sistant managers for next season as 
it has been planned to have a regu

GENERAL ASSEMBLY AT 
CARNEGIE MUSIC HALL
Alumni Award Scholarships. 
Ad dresses by D irector Hamerschlag and Judge BuffingThis morning in the Carnegie Mu
sic Hall the first general assembly 
of the four schools of Carnegie Tech 
was held. The main purpose of the 
meeting was to bring the four schools 
closer together.
It is the desire of the administra-! 
tion that a firm co-operation should 
exist among the four schools. This 
desire was made evident to the Sci
ence students last Wednesday when 
Dean Leete said in effect: . A unit
ed institution is our particular aim, 
and this all-school assembly may be
come a monthly, and perhaps a bi
monthly event. The good feeling 
prevailing at this mornings assembly 
was sufficient grounds for approving 
the new plan. More intimate rela
tions of the students with ono an
other and a common participation 
in all college activities will be the 
immediate result of frequent meet
ings. The school spirit, as evidenced 
in songs and cheers, is much moro 
effective when the cheer leaders have 
teF stiidenfs in one~bod y,~wTie 
Tech and not Science or Design spirit 
prevails.

SCHOLARSHIP AWARDS 
ANNOUNCEDININDUSTRIES
In Industrial Assembly last week 
Dean Connolley announced the win
ners of the different scholarships. 
Because no entrance examination is 
required the men are judged by their 
first year work and the scholarships 
given in their middle year. The 
parents of the winners will be noti
fied, and the letter telling of their 
sons good work will be valued as 
much as a letter from the son him
self.
A competitive scholarship, offered by 
the typothetae of New York City, 
of tuition and living expenses, was 
awarded to Valentine C. Ritter, Low
er Printing.
The Graphica scholarship, given by 
the Department of Printing, was won 
by Clarence Dahl, Middle Printing.
The following students of the Mid
dle class, School of. Applied Indus
tries, were recommended for the an
nual scholarship grants on the basis 
of (1) scholarship, (2) personality 
and conduct, (3) activities and (4) 
need:
1. First Grant of $100.00 and re
fund of fees, was divided equally be

DESIGN SCHOOL READY 
FOR SLAVONIC BALL
Most Gorgeous Spectacle of 
Year Will Be Given On 
Thursday Night
Everything is now in readiness 
for the greatest event of the school 
year, so far as the School of Applied 
Design is concernedthe great an
nual costume fete, which will take 
l^lace tomorrow evening.
?The fete, known this year as the 
Slavonic ball, is the fourth of a se
ries of costume fetes arranged by 
and for the students of the Design 
school each year. The first to at
tract notice was the unforgettable 
Oriental ball, hold in 1914. Unfor
gettable because it was easily the 
most gorgeous and pretentious cos
tume affair ever produced in this 
section of the country, where Pitts
burgh as the millionaires center, 
is wont to cause the rest of tho 
country to rub their eyes in aston
ishment at its Aladdin-like capers.
To quote a local newspaper of tho 
following day, It was the most pre
tentious festival of its nature over 
held in this city. It was tho intro
duction among art students of. a 
jnm conmradle. It was different 
uVom~any thing ever before attempted 
here, and its success moans its repe

NEW DORM WILL BE

The dormitories for men have be
come a permanent institution at 
Carnegio Tech. Tho trustees of tho 
Institute, recognizing tho success of 
tho movement, have acquired addi
tional property adjoining that on 
Woodlawn avenue and running back 
to the unopened junction of North
umberland street. 'Phis acquisition 
gives the school practically tlireo 
acres of land on which to lay out a 
group of buildings adapted to hous
ing a total of five hundred students. 
Mr. Hornbostel, the architect, is now 
at work on a general plan and funds 
are available for tho erection of a 
third building. It is hoped that this 
building will be ready by September
1, 1917. The Institution is now in 
possession of land running 364 feet 
on Woodlawn avenue and over 300 
feet on Northumberland street.
BASKETBALL SEASON 
IS FAST APPROACHING
Large Squad of Men Out and 
Team is Rounding Into 
Form
BAND GIVES CONCERT
Next month will witness the sec
ond annual concert and dance given 
by the Band. The date proposed is 
Friday, January 19, 1917. The Band 
plans to make this affair a fitting 
start of the social events of 1917. As 
rapidly as the plans mature they 
will appear in The Tartan.
With Christmas vacation fast ap
proaching tho basket ball situation 
is beginning to clear up. Having a 
dozen men equally good to pick from 
Coach McCullough has no easy task 
on his hands. With the plobe class 
turning out several men of varsity 
quality and a number of future onos, 
with three last years regulars back 
and half a dozen others looming up 
brightly, the basket ball prospects 
for tho 1917 season appears very 
lirr Indeed.
For a month now Coach McCul

Last Friday, December S, 1916, 
marked a conspicuous milestone in 
the progress of Tho Tartan. Tho 
members of Tho Tartan staff and 
their guests, past editors and busi
ness managers of The Tartan and 
local newspaper writers, in all some 
twenty-four mon, gathered at the Fort 
Pitt hotel to celebrate the institu

After the serving of the dinner, 
the oditor-in-chlof introduced Mr. H. 
J. McCorkle of tho secretarys of

THE CHRISTMAS SPIRIT.
Lot the spirit of Christmas time, 
Peace on earth, good will to men," 
come Into your heart and bo merry 
and glad. But In the midst of your 
merrymaking and charitable thought, 
do not forgot that there are many
to whom Christmas will bring no
clioer. Theso are the hopelessly ill 
In hospitals, the human driftwood in 
the reformatories, the tiny inmates 
oil the orphanages. If you are able 
to, bring a bit of cheerpractical 
eheorinto the dead life ol! someone 
conllnod In one of thoso institutions, 
Do not think such an oifort is a 
waste of time or out of dato. In
deed, It will bo the kindest act you 
can do at Christmas timeto think 
of somoono who has lost his placo,
or Is not yot ablo to talco Ills placo
in the groat world.
STUDENT CO-OPERATIVE STORE.
The school Is largo enough and 
old enough now to support a stu
dent co-operatlvo store such as are 
found in most largo universities of 
tho country, Owing to the peculiar 
situation of tho schools, tho distance 
of any stores from tho campus, it 
would be a paying proposition, aside 
f.rom sale of books and supplies. It 
is not necessary to go into the or
ganization of such an enterprise at 
this timea study of other schools 
could soon determine the most effi
cient and adaptable organization. 
There is one point to be considered; 
that is the effect that it might have 
on the merchants who now help 
support the school publications by 
advertising. A possible answer is 
this: In the store have booths or
salesrooms where it would be pos
sible for merchants to exhibit their 
wares on different days or possibly 
have a permanent stock. This would 
eliminate any complaint on their 
part and might boost their sales be
cause they would be in closer touch 
with the student body and might 
reach some that they would never 
touch otherwise.
PLEBES OF MARGARET 
MORRISONHOLD lSTDANCE
The Plebos of Margaret Morrison 
hold tlvolr first danoo last Friday 
evening in tho Recreation hall. Tho 
room was attractively decorated in 
green and yellow, tho class colors, 
At a seasonable hour refreshments 
wore served and dancing continued 
until one. Tho usual order of dances 
was varied by several Paul Jones, 
which added pep to the party.
The class was well represented, 
about fifty couples being present. 
The chaperones were Misses Logan, 
Caverley and Browning.
Before the highly appreciative first 
general assembly of the four schools 
of Carnegie Institute of Technology, 
Director of Athletics J. H. McCul
lough presented the football letter 
men with their insignia sweaters. 
The demonstrations of the students 
for the team fairly shook the build
ing. When Coach Walter Steffen, 
just in from Chicago especially for 
the occasion, appeared and made a 
short address, the din became tre
mendous.
The following men received letters 
and gold footballs: Captain H. E.
Hellstrom, H. F. Gibson, B. R. 
Wright, J. E. Kesner- F. E. Alt* 
doerfer, G. E. Finlay, P. P. Marshall, 
J. S. McFeaters, J. L. Grady, E. F.

C. N. Irvine.
It was announced that the new 
football manager was Robert E. Ver
non. Two first assistants, instead 
of one as hitherto, were named in 
football. They are C. D. Mills and 
A. A. Manlcel. 
THIRD MEETING OF 
DEBATING SOCIETY
Mr. Chesick \ opened the third 
meeting of the Tech Debating So
ciety in Room 11, Friday afternoon. 
The constitution was read by Chair
man Jones.
Seven men wore present Friday 
afternoon, some of whom were pre
pared to debate the subject of Col
lege Military Preparedness. One side 
had not become ready with their argu
ments, and the club fixed a penalty 
of two weeks suspension of any 
mombers who neglected to prepare 
assigned subjects. Mr. J. P. Jones, 
read the constitution which tho pro
gram committee had drafted. The 
entire draft was favorably reported.
The next meeting of tho society 
will bo the Friday following the hol
idays, January 5. Notices of tho 
program will be posted on tho bulle
tin boards of. oacli school, as several 
men from Design and Industries have

BUILDING CONSTRUCTION 
CLUB DANCE A SUCCESS
The Building Construction Club 
gave a dance last Friday night in 
Carnegie Union. The dance was a 
success partly because of tho work 
of the energetic committee and part
ly because it was not a money mak
ing scheme; every cent received for 
tlcketB went into the dance. Music 
was supplied by Parillos six-piece 
orchestra. Plenty of refreshments 
were served and every one spent an 
enjoyable evening. The programs 
were elaborate and are probably the 
best programs given at any dance 
this year.
The dance was staged to promote 
that social life which is so essential 
to Tech.
LECTURE FRIDAY IN INSTITUTE ON THE ART OF FRANCE
The Art of France will be the 
subject of. a lecture by Robert B. 
Harshe, assistant director of the De
partment of Fine Arts, on Friday, 
December 15, 1916, at S:15 p. m., 
in the Lecture 1-Iall of Carnegie In
stitute.
This lecture will be the second of 
a series of nine lectures, Illustrated 
by lantern slides, on the modern art 
of Europe and of America, with espe
cial referonco to the art of tho past.
will be represented by Carl C. Grein
er, A. S., 19, who is scheduled to de
liver an address, The Work of a 
Chapter in a Technical College.
The society has seventy-two chap
ters in the seventy-two leading uni
versities and colleges of the country. 
There are only five in this state and 
these are at Penn, Penn State, W. & 
J., Tech and Pitt.
The local representative will re
port on the progress of the Tech 
Chapter, the success of the lectures, 
the advantages and the disadvantages 
of such work at a technical college, 
and the interest and attitude taken 
In general by the student body and 
the faculty.
Mr. Greiner will probably be heard 
with a great deal of interest, partly 
because the local chapter is new and 
party because the only other technic
al college chapter of the society, the 
one at Massachusetts Tech, may not 
be represented.

STUUENTS PRESENT 
POETASTER IN DETROIT
The first attempt of the students 
of the Department of Dramatic Arts 
of the School of Applied Design to 
invade another city and please a 
strange audience proved highly suc
cessful when the Poetaster was 
taken to Detroit and given three per
formances in the Detroit Art Mu
seum.
The play was alike unknown to 
Detroit patrons of the drama as it 
was and is to most Pittsburgh peo
ple, but it did not fail to please, 
and each of the three audiences 
manifested intelligent appreciation 
of the more obvious aspects of Jonson's comedy, and also of the care
ful and accurate acting done by the 
large group of students who made 
up the cast. The newspaper criti
cisms, with one exception, were con
ventionally complimentary, uninter
esting, and devoid of any fair esti
mate of the place which the Poe
taster production holds in the 
artistic annals of the current theat
rical season.
The party, consisting of about 
forty-five students, was under the 
supervision of Mr. and Mrs. Thomas 
Wood Stevens. The students trav
eled in two Pullmans going up and 
one day coach coming back. The 
trip home was replete with bumps 
and delays; rain and fog and in some 
respects was quite a ghastly substi
tute for what it might have been.

bers were present, which shows that 
they are interested in making the 
club a live wire among the organ
izations. at Tech.
The faculty members of the Com
mercial Department will also be 
present at this meeting and deliver 
short talks. These also prove very 
helpful and instructive and are al
ways appreciated by the club riiembers.
The refreshment committee have a 
surprise in the way of eats for 
that night, but so far it has been 
unable to find out just what it is. 
Plenty of smokes will be on hand 
for every one.
In order that this may be made 
the most successful meeting the club 
ever had, all the members and those 
who expect to- be members in the 
near future must co-operate' by com

CONTRACTS AWARDED FOR THISTLE PRINTING AND ENGRAVING
TARTAN BOARD
HOLDS BANQUET
(Continued From Page One.) 
Ted Rauh, editor-in-chief in 14- 
15, recounted the valuable experi
ence he had received . while on The 
Tartan staff. He said he believed it 
to be of as much value as any of 
his studies, and remarked that The 
Tartan is the only student activity 
which has advanced with the foot
ball team.
Cap Waite, business manager in 
0S-09, was also called upon, and his 
remarks later brought out the fact 
that whereas a year ago the issue 
of No. 10 of The Tartan was below 
1000 copies, issue No. 10 in 1916 in
cluded more than 2600 copies.. Then, 
too, the total quantity of news had 
been increased 45 per cent by plac
ing it in smaller type.
Arch H. Cowan, business manager 
in 15-16, spoke briefly on his experi
ences on The Tartan staff.
Dear Old Tech brought to a close 
the evenings gathering, which is 
now a regular affair, and which the 
membership of the staff expect, in 
years to come, will be one^ of the j 
chief events looked forward to by j 
the students who interest them
selves in this phase of. the student i 
life at Tech. I

ance on past books insures the qual
ity of this work in the coming one. 
J. C. Bragdon has been awarded the 
contract for the engraving, and Mur
doch, Kerr & Company that for the 
printing and binding of the book.
Thus the 1917 Thistle ip strictly a 
Pittsburgh product, as from planning 
to distribution all purchases are be
ing made and paid- work done with
in the boundaries of the Steel City. 
This will be a great convenience to 
the editors, and it is also hoped that 
it will be duly noted by the mer
chants and others whose assistance 
is sought for the advertising pages.
The book has been laid out in sev
en main divisions.. Administration 
and faculty comes first, in charge of 
F. C. McConnell, of, Design School. 
The second section will be devoted 
to the classes, under the guidance of 
Fred L. Sharpe, of Industries. Third 
in the list is the athletic section, 
conducted by E. C. Cargill, of Science. 
Fourth is activities, and fifth, organ
izations, for which C. E. Rutherford 
of Industries will be responsible. 
Last of the text sections proper 
comes the comic section, and be
tween this and the back cover will 
be located the advertisements. Space 
in the advertising section is hand
led by the student activities advertis
ing bureau, embodied in M. B. Gar
ber,, of Design School, with offices in 
the top floor of Central Building.
The sales campaign is well under 
way and about 50 students have vol
unteered as agents. Some misunderstanring has been evident as to 
the ordering of Thistles as Christmas 
gifts. The book is expected to be 
published and ready for distribution 
the last week in April. Gift certifi: 
cates, stating, that a book lias been 
ordered and will be delivered as soon 
as ready, have been prepared and 
will be issued on request of persons 
ordering Thistles before Christmas 
to be given to other persons. The 
agents will take the name of the 
person ordering the book and the 
name and address of the person to 
whom the gift certificate is to be 
sent. This information will be 
turned In to the sales manager and 
the board will have the card filled 
out and mailed to the receiver of the 
gift. It is hoped that on publication 
of the book persons ordering them 
for others will call for the books 
and make the deliveries, but where 
this is not practicable the board will 
see that delivery is made.
They will be most acceptable gifts. 
The editor opines that most of the 
students will want to keep their own 
copies right with them till they go 
home in June. Meanwhile if the fond 
mammas and proud papas and upand-coming kid brothers and doting 
sisters and ultra-delectable best girls 
have no copies of their own, . they 
will have to go without. And think 
how busy they may be with things 
and people you would rather ' have 
them drop to read the book of your 
year at Tech, with your name and 
your picture and all about the doings 
of your classes and clubs and teams 
in it! At least, so runneth the ar
gument. Th editor believes it him

Turther intensified the interest and 
astonishment caused by the Oriental 
ball among the art schools and lov
ers of the unique and beautiful 
throughout the country. At that time 
an audience of visiting college and 
university deans and representatives 
from all over the country, to the 
number of two hundred, carried 
away impressions that were little 
short of amazing, to their respective 
schools. .
This years Slavonic ball, however, 
-lyds fair to outrival everything here
tofore attempted. Certainly, if a 
stouter source of revenuethe stu
dent fees having been almost doubled 
and if hard and concentrated ef
fort and labor can afford any guar
antee whatever, then superior suc
cess is doubly assured.
Promptly at nine the festivities 
will begin. Eligible students will 
present themselves at the Woodlawn 
avenue entrance of the Design 
school. They will come fully at
tired in their costumes, in all their 
gorgeous array, and having satisfied 
the husky Tylers at the door as to 
tb.eir eligibility, will immediately re
pair to the festive hall, where the 
barbaric setting and draperies will 
commingle and reflect their own im
pressionistic Slavonic dress.
Again this week we call attention 
to the work of Arleigli B. William
son, the president of Design, who 
has constructed the organization 
which made this ball. Under his 
supervision there has again been en
listed the services of those designers 
of the previous balls of Design 
school, Howard B. Pearce and Pridgeon Smith. These two men, com
ing together at the time of the Ori
ental ball, have worked together in 
guiding some of the largest events 
ever held at Tech.
But in the department of actual 
execution, too much credit cannot 
be given to Marvin C. Adams and 
Homer Ludwig for the executive 
ability and hard work which they 
have contributed. Adams, as chief 
of construction, while handicapped 
by an . unloolced for charette, has 
worked heroically to produce the

dinner at Collazzis.
This year it is expected to make it 
of still more importance to the big 
city. All the students, faculty and 
alumni of Carnegie Tech are invited 
to help make it a success.
It is hoped that by making this an 
annual affair, Carnegie Tech will be
come better known in the Metropolis 
and graduates will receive greater 
prestige. In order to select a con
venient date for a majority, Saturday 
night the 23rd or 30th has been pro
posed, and it is hoped that all thoso 
who will be In New York on either 
of these dates will attend the din

morning was unusually complete and 
diversified. Promptly at 9:30 theScience and Design students formed 
line on the campus and marched 
to the music hall. This famous pro
cession of. Techites, which is so 
broad and long that it becomes nec
essary to break step in crossing the 
Schenley bridge, and the same pro
cession which , makes the Pitt root
ers envious at Pitt-Tech contests, 
was plainly in evidence this morn
ing. When all had entered the Mu
sic hall the Alumni association took 
charge of the meeting. The scholar
ships given by former classes were 
presented to deserving students. Mr 
McCorkle, secretary of the Alumni 
association, took charge pf the meet
ing. The association will have 
luncheon at the Port Pitt hotel this 
noon. Colonel Church is the honor 
guest of the occasion. At 10:30 the 
M. M. C.'S. and Industries studonts 
entered the assembly and all the 
sons and daughters of Carnegie Tech 
\vere then one in sentiment. This 
hour was given to speeches by Di
rector Iiamerschlag and Judge Buf
fington. The director's address was 
named The Unity of the Institu
tion, and with his usual persuasive 
manner and straight hoart-to-lieart 
talk, the director outlined the policy 
of general co-operation. Ho empha
sized the bright prospects which 
faced Carnegie Institute of Tech
nology when It grow in spirit as it 
had in number of studonts. Then 
followed an eloquent address by 
Judge Buffington, a loyal friend of 
our Institution. Judge Buffington 
has always appealed to the moral 
side of. student life and has laid 
more emphasis on character devel
opment than on professional stand
ing. His ideas have been Urmly ce
mented into the student life and 
have tended to mould the unity of 
college spirit which is at present so 
much desired.
At 11:30 the Students Activities 
were in charge of the assembly. The 
main business before them was to 
award the football letters and insig
nia. The awards are given in an
other column of this issue. The 
feature of, this hour was for Coach 
Walter Steffen and his address to the 
student body. He praised the atti
tude and co-operation of his football 
men, and reserved no credit for him
self, for the splendid showing the 
team lias made this season. Coach 
Steffen is too modest, yet this qual
ity above all others, has won him 
firmly to every student. He has made 
football at Carnegie Tech, and his 
straightforward methods have made 
Ills success the more worthy. Cheer
leader Merrill was busy leading 
cheers and songs at every opportuni
ty until towards 12:30 the assembly 
was adjourned, that afternoon class
es might be resumed.
This first assembly has been a 
remarkable event, one certain to go 
down in the annals of Carnegie Tech 
as the start of college spirit, and the 
discarding of Individual school spir
it. The assembly bids fair to be
come popular with all the students. 
It has just started, but its growth 
will be rapid.
As a result of a mail ballot which

TECH IS ON LOOKOUT 
I OR GOOD ATHLETES
Carnegie Tech wishes to get in 
touch with high school athletes who 
are considering entering college. 
Graduate Manager Gearhart wishes 
to get the names of these men in 
order that he may try to interest 
them in Tech, not only from an ath
letic standpoint, but also interest 
them in Tech as a college.
When you are home this Christ
mas look up some of the men in your 
high school who are prominent in 
athletics and find out if they are 
thinking of going to college and also 
what they want to take up. Then 
when you come back in January fill 
out this slip (better cut it out now), 
and drop it In the postoffice or in 
the graduate managers office in the 
Central building.
(Continued From Page One.)
Greene, last years varsity man, 
cannot be overlooked because of his 
speed, passing and shooting ability. 
Abrams, former Central high star, 
is very fast and tricky. Although 
rather small and light, he easily 
makes up for this by his all arouryl 
good playing. Hap Slater, anoth
er varsity man, is also showing top 
form, especially since his former 
teammate, Phil Marshall of Peabody 
high, fame is now with him. Phil 
and Hap form a smooth passing 
combination. Both Foxeri and Gath 
are plebes but will push the older 
men hard for a. position. Foxen is a 
big man, who shows more develop
ment than most of the plebes with 
the exception of Levy. Gath gets a 
look in through his clever passing.
The center position seems to be a 
toss up between Carey and Craig, 
with perhaps Carey having a slight 
edge due to his speed. Both are 
young giants around 6 feet 3 inches 
in height and render excellent ac
counts of themselves.
At guard there are many good men 
making it hard to choose between 
them. Nig Finlay, last years varsity 
man, is there with the weight, speed 
and aggressiveness. Nig has a de
ceptive way of handling the ball that 
fools his guards. Levy, Science 
ilebe and former Central high star, 
although short is a veritable demon 
at getting around with the ball. 
Backed up by his passing and team
work, he will make a strong bid for 
a position.
The more you see of Phil Marshall 
the better you like his playing. Phil 
has a habit of being everywhere at 
once. 1-Ie can shoot like a forward 
and at breaking up plays, he is at his 
best. It will be hard to keep Phil 
off the squad. Don Curtis is another 
likely guard. He is fast, has lots of 
weight, and is a good shot. Beside 
these, there are others almost as 
good.
With an eye to the future, it might 
be well to mention some of the 
plebes. This year, the same as last, 
they will have a team of their own 
and meet the surrounding prep, 
schools and college freshmen.
Koefed is a good forward, who can 
shoot foul goals with regularity. Baken 
can either play forward or jump cen
ter. He is a product of W.estinghouse high. Wire, a tall Indus
tries plebe, will make a good center, 
if he gets some more pep into 
his play.
Dunn, a guard, haling from Crafton high, is there with the ability 
and fight. He shows promise of de
velopment.
With the opening game January 
5 with the Westlnghouse Club, less 
than three weeks off, there is still 
much to be done. But rest assured, 
that when the time comes Tech will 
be represented by a well drilled 
team.
