WEST VIRGINIA-TECH TRACK MEET
With the first meet of the season in competition 
with outsiders, Tech displayed remarkable form and 
point winning ability. Last Friday was the time of 
the walloping giving our Morgantown friends in 
their home town. Arriving at the field after a long 
drive in the cold, the men went into the 100-yard 
dash with no chance to warm up, made only second
and third which greatly delighted the West Virgin
ians. Subsequent events sent the blood tingling, 
and the meet was finished in a deathly silence. A

for the Faculty, and, on May 25 from 8.30 until 12 
for the students. All of the other nights when it will 
be in good view are reserved for the public, and it is 
for this reason that the above mentioned arrange
ment has been made.
All Margaret Morrison girls are to use the night 
mentioned for the faculty.
SENIOR BALL.
Invitations are now being sent out for the Senior 
Ball, which will be held at the Rittenhouse on Tues
day, June 14.
The committee rs experiencing considerable dif
ficulty in obtaining the addresses of local Tech 
Alumni, and it is very probable that some of the Old 
Giads will not receive invitationswhich fact, how
ever, does not interfere in any way with their 
eligibility, nor will it interfere with their having 
the best time the Senior Class can show them.
The committee will appreciate, and give prompt 
attention to requests for invitations. In order to 
obtain some idea of the number who will probably 
be present, recipients of invitations are requested to 
signify whether or not they expect to attend.
The order of dances will be posted some time be
fore Senior examinations are over. Communications 
should be addressed to Senior Ball Committe, or to
E. B. Taggart, Chairman, care of Carnegie Tech 
Schools.

HOUSE, JUNE 14.
CIVIL ENGINEERING SOCIETY MEETING.
The May meeting of the society Monday evening 
was by all means the most successful of the year. 
All of the regular members, and many of the Alumni 
were present to welcome the Plebes who have chosen 
Civil and Sanitary Engineering. The total attend
ance was about seventy.
The president opened the meeting by explaining its 
purpose and the attitude of the members toward the 
new class.
Prof. Thayer gave a brief history of the society, 
telling how in its early days meetings were held at 
homes of members, and how with a membership of 
only sixteen, fourteen or fifteen were always pres
ent. He mentioned the prevailing good fellowship 
between Juniors and Sophomores, 
in the department as shown in the recent track meet
Prof. Mott claimed relationship with both Sopho
mores and Plebes from the fact that he was initiated 
into the society with the Sophomores and entered the 
school with the Plebes. He spoke of the broad scope 
of civil work, and gave a clear idea of the duties 
of a sanitary engineer. He accented the fact that in 
choosing a course, the individual should regard himsell as a social unit; the choice of a profession be
ing a moral obligation.
Mr. Reed told the new members that the society 
worked for the welfare of all; and that they would 
preceeding classes.
Plebe members were then called upon and Stuart 
and Dornberger responded in a way which left no 
doubt as to their ability to carry their share.
Alumni were called upon in a burlesque way. Mr. 
Beck told how he organized the society. Hammond 
glorified the ancient order of Mutts, being ignorant 
of the fact that some count the Mutts dead. Latham 
told of some of the experiences of queer men in a 
structural shop. Anderson mentioned some of the 
trials of job getting. (The kid was not there.)
After the speeches all adjourned to the instrument 
room where Witte and his gang had a big lunch pre
pared. Story telling and general good fellowship 
prevailed until a late hour.

-HE TARTAN
HISTORICAL SKETCH OF
The inception of the idea that now is realized in 
the White Friars Club, is lost, to the uninitiated, 
in the whirl of School politics early in the spring of 
1907. Suffice it to say that the Club was organized 
with a charter membership of 32. When the details 
of organization were perfected and the object and 
scope of the Club clearly defined, it was too late in 
the year to make a presentation of any magnitude, 
so matters hung fire until the fall of IS07.
With the re-opening of the Schools in September 
plans for the coming year were discussed, but noth
ing definite was done. A little later an organization 
styled The Freshman Comedy Club made its ap
pearance, but soon suitable arrangements, agreeable 
to both parties, were made, and the new Club was 
absorbed by the White Friars. A committee was 
appointed to select a vehicle for the Clubs initial 
performance, and reported favorably on Winston 
Churchills Title Mart. Rehearsals were conduct
ed for a month, during which time the Club was 
unable to secure a Director. One happy day, how 
ever, Mr. Fields brought Mr. Walter B. Edmundson 
to a rehearsal, and his offer to direct the Club for 
the remainder of the year was immediately ac
cepted.
Preparations for presentation were made and the 
date selected was June 16, 1908. On May 16, for a 
number of reasons, the Club decided to discontinue
W. L. G. Gibson as Rudolph Kuchenkraut
WHITE FRIARS CLUB
Oscar Bieler as May
rehearsals of The Title Mart, and procure a 
lighter play, more suitable to the histrionic abilities 
of the Company. All in a Dormitory, a musical 
comedy, was then chosen, and work started under 
high pressure.
That the men worked well, and that the Club was 
more than fortunate in having Mr. Edmundson as 
Director, is proved by the fact that the date, origi
nally chosen, June 16, was not changed. The play 
was staged in exactly one month.
The First Varsity Show of the Carnegie Technical 
Schools was given in the Auditorium at Sewickley, 
Pa., on the night of June 12, 1S08, and scored an im
mediate and pronounced hit. The costumes were 
furnished by Van Horne & Company, of Philadelphia, 
Pa. An Orchestra, composed of Carnegie students, 
under the direction of Mr. Wm. Dorrington, provided 
the music. Great credit is due Mr. Dorrington for 
his excellent coaching of the Glee chorus and mem
bers of the cast having single parts.
After the performance the entire company, with a 
few guests, repaired to the Fort Pitt Hotel, and after 
a royal banquet, plans were made to put the Club 
on a more secure basis.
This first year of the White Friars will become, 
as the years go on, the great tradition of the Club, 
the tale to tell, when good Friars foregather and 
recall old times and old names, inseparably connect
ed with themsuch names as Steen, Nicols, Gibson, 
-and nowbut that, as Mr. Kipling aptly remarks, 
is another story.
The fall of 1908 saw preparations started early 
for the Second Annual Show. Mr. Edmundson was 
secuied, and his book, His Highness the Chief, the 
Clubs first original play, was rehearsed.
This years production was on much more elabor

---------------------------------------------------

6THE TARTAN
ate scale than the previous year. Jos. Horne Com
pany made all the costumes to order, and the 
props were purchased outright by the Club. The 
music was again directed by Mr. Dorrington, and 
with an augmented School Orchestra an extended 
trip was taken, including Sewickley, Butler, and 
New Castle.
In Pittsburgh, matiness and evening perform
ances were given June 29th instead of the single 
evening presentation of the previous year. This 
production was very favorably received by both 
press and public, and compared excellently with the 
shows of older college clubs of similar order.
In conclusion, it may be well to explain briefly the 
plan of organization of the White Friars Club: It 
is a club, pure and simple, comprising two degrees 
of membership, graduate and undergraduate.
The undergraduate club is, as its name implies, 
c mposed of men registered in the Schools. The 
requirements for eligibility in this club are that a 
man must have had a place in either the cast or 
chorus, or have held some executive position, with 
some one of the Clubs productions. The eligible 
men are recommended by the Board of Governors 
(consisting of seven men), and by it are elected t' 
membership. The graduate club consists of mem
bers of the undergraduate club, to be elected upon 
graduation from the Schools.
More than this brief explanation cannot be given, 
except, perhaps, to say that the very foundations of 
the Club rest upon The honor of Carnegiea square 
deal to every mana good show, and the best 
of fellowship.
APPLIED SCIENCE SENIOR BALL, RITTENHOUSE, JUNE 14.
 RETROSPECTION 
For its always fair weather 
When White Friars get together,
With the cast on the boards 
And the chorus singing loud.
That old song of good fellowship and Devil-maycare flitted through my thoughts and unconsiously
I parodied it, and sat listening to the reminiscenses 
of some of the old Friars at a rehearsal a night or so 
ago. There was a bunch of them: Steen, Nicols, 
Gibby, Mitch, Bieler, Borschneck, and others, 
dropping in one at a time, until the Old Guard was 
nearly complete, grouped around Jamie, at the 
piano. Of course Ed and Dorry were there 
whipping the new men into shape.
The spirit of the song was there, all right, for it 
was great to hear those fellows talking about the 
first years show. Recollections of all-night rehear
sals, somebodys bad break, butting onto the stage 
on a wrong cue, and all the little incidents of put
ting on a show, serious enough at the time, but 
plenty to laugh at as one looks backward and re
calls them all. It is the kind of things that warms 
the heart andoh! it is simply the real spirit of 
White Friars.
Just listen, with me, for a moment to the Old 
Friars:
Dorry turns to Mitchell: Say, Mitch, do you 
remember the time we bought you that dress at 
was it Myer-Jonassons?
MitchellDo I?well, I wouldnt do that again 
for anything, with all those.
Gibby breaks inGot to show me where any 
show, all things considered, can equal All in a dor
mitory. 
SteenGoing down on the train to Sewickley 
first time, Mitchell was sitting next to me and had 
a corset cover in his overcoat pockethed forgot
ten it until the last minute, then had to stuff it in 
his pockety When he wasnt looking, I took it out 
of his pocket and put it in mine. Got to Sewickley 
and Mitch missed his corset cover. Where in Sam 
Hill had he left that thing? Nothing for it, but 
must get another. He beat it out to a store, the 
rest of the fellows, who were onto the game, fol
lowed him. Mitch looked funny enough when he 
asked the woman for a corset cover, but the expres
sion on that girls face was too much for the fel
lows outside. Wish you could have heard them 
yell.
Then I butt into the gameCome across with a 
few stories, you fellows.
Nicols was the first to comply.
Last year up in Butler, everything seemed to be 
out of focus. Every little thing went wrong. There 
was a scene in which Gibby, Laithe and Bearinger 
were on stage alone. In my part as a permanently 
unmarried old girl, I was continually chasing Gib
by. Well, Berry had a line that was almost identi
cal with my entrance cue five minutes later. SomeU. C. Bearinger and Oscar Bieler

---------------------------------------------------

THE TARTAN1
body yelled at me in the dressing room, Hey, Nick, 
your cues coming! I beat it out of the dressing 
room and onto the stage, and stood there smiling 
in sweet imbecility. The other three, who were not 
expecting anybody, turned around in surprise. I 
never saw a funnier looking crowd in all my life. 
Laithe looked as though he wanted to disappear, 
and Bearinger started to laugh. Gibby looked at me 
once, then beat it off the stage, and we after him. 
He chased around the back, came in the other side, 
and said, with a sigh of relief, Mein Gott! bot dat 
was a glose shafe, and it scored a big hit.
Nicks story started the others going, and Mitchell 
came across next.
I had a womans part, and the dress that the 
Van Horne people sent I ripped into shreds at the 
first Dress Rehearsal. So I had to buy a new one. 
Dorry went with me to Myer Jonassons. I asked 
the floor-walker where the womens dress depart
ment was. He looked at us rather funny, then said 
third floor. The elevator man shut the door and 
started up just as we had barely got off. We soon 
found out why. All over that whole floor were 
women in all stages of dress and undress. We had 
to wait, with our backs turned for about five min
utes until a girl, blushing furiously came to wait on 
us. I dont want to have to do that again.
Mitchell to SteenSay, Marion, lucky we had 
your auto to chase around in, or wed never have 
got that first show put on in time.
SteenYoure right. Say, fellows, do you re
member that first dress rehearsal in the Bijou, and 
that old grouch who made trouble about knocking 
down the scenes?
Nicols, Gibson and Mitchell, almost in chorus 
Do I? you bet, but Ill tell you the Bijou was 
bad enough, but how about that one at the Gayety? 
Oh, worse!
Lowell W, Nicols as Priscilla
Ottmar Tishlarich as The Count in Disgust
This one happeened on April first, down at Joe 
Hornes, Borschneck joins the group.
Steen and I went down there to get my corset. 
We picked out a nice looking girl, and asked for a 
corset, then a smile broke out:
Not today, she said.
We have the money for it all right, if that is the 
trouble, said Steen, starting to get raw.
You cant hand me that game on April Fools 
Day, and she started to beat it.
It took us nearly five minutes to convince that 
girl that we really wanted a corset.
Then another time I was h?ving my dress fitted 
in one of those little coops at Hornes, and the girl 
had just finished putting the corset on me, when I 
heard a funny scratching behind one of the parti
tions. Didnt pay much attention to it, but when 
my dress was on, and the girl was hooking me up, 
it was so loud and insistant that I looked up just 
in time to see the heads of three wrapper girls dis
appearing behind the wall. They evidently had en
joyed the sight of a man in corsets very much, to 
judge by the giggling and suppressed laughter that 
came from that direction.
Steen recalls this one: First night in Sewickley, 
Borsch and I were doing a dance together, the floor 
wag very slippery, and we had just made our way 
backwards through the chorus to the exit, when I

---------------------------------------------------

iTHE TARTAN
slipped and sat down as neatly as tho I had 
practiced it for a month. Got up like a shot and 
beat it. Heard a big racket in the house, and then
I guess that Borsch had fallen exactly as I had done, 
at the identical moment. Of course we danced the 
encore, but the house was disappointed when we 
did not sit down again.
Another one from Nicols:
This happened at the Bijou at the first dress re
hearsal for All In a Dormitory. Lord! it was a 
messthe theatre, I mean; for it was about three 
weeks after the close of the season. Borschneck, 
Mitchell and I had the boudoir, formerly occupied 
by Nellie, the Beautiful Cloak Model, The Queen 
of the High Binders, and the lady in the case in 
Why Girls Leave Home.
After the first half hour we abandoned the clothes 
pegs on the wall, and used strings suspended from 
the ceiling. For a very good reason we got tired 
using the fire extinguisher onhave you no imagina
tion?
It was the finale of the first acteverybody was 
cursing andmad. The lines of the play, in their 
original form called for a bucket, to be brought on 
the stage, by the messenger boy, Sprague, for the 
purpose of catching Silvernails tears, in one of the 
pathetic parts. We had always left this out, in fact 
hardly anyone had ever noticed that it 
was in the lines but Lugi was on the
R. H. Horton as Ted Schuyler
job that night, with a keen eye for Belasco effects. 
Marion Steen and myself were down stage left. 
When the moment came Lugie came on the runhe had the bucket, and in his excitement set it down. 
Belasco could never have produced a more life-like 
Niagara Falls. It was a round-bottomed fire-bucket 
filled with limpid green goo. You can imagine the 
result. It put the whole show on the blink for 
just half an hour.
Surely all of such incidents did not happen the 
first year, I remarked when the laugh had subsided.
Well, rather, no. It was Edmundson doing the 
talking now.
I do happen to remember a rare one that took 
place last season. Through the munificence of the 
management, here a low and profound bow to Steen 
who returned the salutation, we went to a photogra
pher as soon as costumes were fitted for a series of 
pictures to be used for advertising. The place select
ed was in a Trust Companys building near the roof, 
and opposite the business offices of one of the larg
est department stores in Pittsburgh. Keally and 
Borschneck were all togged out in their gowns and 
wigs and had just come from the studio, and were 
waiting for some groups to be taken. Steen, here, 
went over to the window that overlooked the street 
and faced the department store, and Keally followed. 
All at once a bald headed man in the central office 
opposite looked out of the window and caught sight 
of the buxom form of Keally squeezed up in No. 23 
corsets, and his glances lingered there. Keally, 
smiled, and the gentleman became visibly interested. 
Then Steen got wise and the two started quite a 
flirtation. It was not long before the male occupants 
of the other offices joined the group of spectators and 
then the windows the whole length of the floor were 
lined with faces. To cap the climax, the lady re
moved Marions toby and then threw kisses to the 
bald head. We had the croud on the go. When we 
got tired laughing, Keally took off his wig and held 
it up for his admirers to see. I never saw such a 
foolish looking set of men in all my life.
How about this years show? I inquired.
Let Edmundson answer thathes the man to 
give us the real dope.
Hi, Edmundson, come over here and give us ycur 
opinion of the show.
Mr. Edmundson comes over to the piano slowly 
and delivers himself of the following:
Going to be the best show the Friars have ever 
staged. We have a gilt-edged cast and a fast cho
rus. It is not my place to say anything about the 
bookbut I will say that the whole company takes 
advantage of every opening for good acting and 
laugh-producing business that I have given them. 
Music is much better than last year, and there is 
no comparison to be made in regard to the cos
tumes. That second-act specialty is going to make 
a lot of people sit up and take notice.
But what do you think of the future of the Fri
ars, Mr. Edmundson? I asked.
That is a rather hard question to answer prop
erly. It is one which, to make the answer worth 
full value, should be carefully thought out. There

---------------------------------------------------

THE TARTAN
is one thing which is certain, the future of the Friars 
is rosy. We have, I sincerely believe, passed the 
crisis of our life. Now, with good management, and 
by that I mean safe, conservative, logical manage
ment, it is only a question of a few years before the 
White Friars will be on a firm financial basis. We 
are rapidly drawing around us from the outside 
public a firm following who support our efforts. This
following increases year by year, the yearly increase 
being very noticeable. It does not take the mind of 
a Morgan to see where that leads to. The increase 
in the artistic side of the White Friars is very 
marked. So with everything on the increase and 
nothing on the decrease the future of the Friars can 
only be bright.

afternoon and evening of May 28th. This is the third 
show given by the best known of our student clubs.
It has been carefully planned this year and caren 
fi-lly staged. Nothing has been spared to make it a 
worthy successor to His Highness, theChef. Those 
who know the most about such things say that it is 
very much superior, considered from every angle, 
than anything here-to-fore given. It is now up to 
the srtudents to make the Friars feel justified in 
spending so much time, trouble, and money.
It has been said that the outside public are the 
ones who make the Friars a financial success. This 
is not, and should not be, so. It is the support of 
the entire student body, not of one quarter, not of 
one half, but of the entire student body which 
makes it possible to put on such a show as the Friars 
are putting on this year.
Therefore let every man and women connected 
with or interested in the Carnegie Technical Schools, 
make it a point to attend. It wont break you, and 
it may make the club, so be there.
APPLIED SCIENCE SENIOR BALL, RITTENHOUSE, JUNE 14.
THE TRACK TEAM.
With last Saturdays Track Meet at West Virginia, 
the Track Team became one of the prominent rep
resentatives of Carnegie Tech. Such a victory as 
they achieved, places them in a position to command 
attention and in a fair way to become one of the 
most successful of the athletic teams.. The InterSchools Meet was largely responsible for the wide 
interest taken and the latitude of selection of men 
is by no means a result to be overlooked.
The coming Inter-Collegiate Meet will give a better 
opportunity to match strength. It will also afford an 
opportunity to see whether strict training is con
sidered an essential for Carnegie Techs representa
tives. If it is, we know one point winner in the 
West Virginia Meet who will be among those pres
ent.
NOTICE.
Concerning Commencement Week.
To the Editor of the Tartan:
As the time is at hand for the completion of Com
mencement plans, it is highly desirable that no conflictions occur between the events scheduled by the
different Schools. In order to avoid such a con
tingency, the Presidents of Classes and Committees 
on Arrangements are requested to report, at the
earliest moment, to the Secretarys Office all in
formation concerning events scheduled during Com
mencement Week.
W. P. FIELD, Secretary.
PROFESSOR GIBBS ON SOUND.
The next to the last of the Applied Science popu
lar lecture course open to the public was given be
fore a large audience in the Lecture Hall of the Sci
ence Building last Wednesday night.
Prof. Gibbs long suit has always been experi
ments designed to explain and clarify each point 
he desires to make. In the lecture he performed 
over twenty-five experiments, and was forced to 
omit many of the ones he wanted to have an oppor
tunity of showing the public. At no time was the 
subject made too technical for all present to clearly 
understand. Prof. Mott concluded the series this 
week with his illustrated lecture on The Regulation 
of Street Traffic in Large Cities.
MISS CLARA WEST ADDRESSES THE WOMEN 
STUDENTS.
On Monday, May 2, the women students of the 
University had the good fortune to hear an address 
by Miss Clara West, Dean of the Margaret Morrison 
Carnegie Institute. Miss West talked on The Ideal 
Curriculum for the Woman Student of Today and 
displayed a charming personality and a wealth of 
womanly ideals. Not a girl there but left with the 
feeling of inspiration and the ambition to realize 
some few of the ideals which Miss West portrayed 
so vividly.University of Cincinnati Weekly.

MHO CLUB.
The loyal members of the Mho Club who respond
ed to the monthly call on Thursday evening, May 
12, 10, were splendidly entertained and instructed 
by Mr. Wilson, 09. The employment of Mr. Wilson 
with the Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing 
Company, has brought him in contact with the 
Oscillagraph, with which he has had considerable 
experience. The aforesaid statement was obviously 
verified by the numerous lantern slides displayed 
and the vivid descriptions given of the various appli
cations of the Oscillagraph for the determination 
of certain branches of electrical phenomina.
After attributing a vote of thanks to Mr. Wilson, 
due consideration was then given to the selection of 
that member, who is to receive the artistic cup pre
sented by Prof. Wurts for the best discussion at the 
meetings. A vote of the eligible members revealed 
the fact that Mr. Culbertson has offered the best dis
cussions of the various subjects presented at the 
meetings throughout the entire year.
A special meeting of the Mho Club will be held 
Tuesday, May 24, 10, and it is desired that a good 
attendance will be fruit of this notice.
Monday is Red Necktie day with the Junior 
Electricals.
Did you see Mutt and Jeff at the Mho Club-Plebe 
game on Saturday?
MHO CLUB WINS.
The Mho Club added another victory to its long 
list last Saturday morning by defeating the Plebe 
team in a slow, uninteresting game to the tune of 
95. Neither team put up its customary game with
the largest bunch of errors chalked up against the 
Plebes. Each team scored once in the first inning 
and after that the game belonged to anybody. Only 
seven innings were played.
The Mho Club has played four games and has not 
yet had to taste the bitterness of defeat. The con
sistent hitting and aaring base running has been a 
large element in the Mho Club victories.
Games with any of the club teams or class teams 
are desired. Arrangements should be made soon as 
the season is short.

FIFTH ANNUAL PATRONS DINNER.
The big event of the year for the School of Applied 
Design takes the form of a dinner given by the Night 
School in honor of Mr. Henry Hornbostel, Dean and 
Patron. Donegal Inn, at West View Park was the 
scene of gaiety. Early in the afternoon the crowd 
assembled and the annual baseball game between 
the day and night schools for the Patrons cup was 
played, and won by the Night School to be held until 
next year. Mr. Janssen won the faculty 100 yard 
dash, and Mr. Hornbostel the special match with Mr. 
Weber. After some exciting hurdle racing, the hun
gry ones formed a snake dance to the festive edifice.
By the forethought of the committee in charge, a 
quantity of grease paint was on hand, and each man 
made up in some comic manner before the proces
sion to the dining, hall was commenced. Here, with 
the faculty seated, the snake dance about the tables 
was given.
After the first course the Smoke Quartette com
menced the musical portion of the program. The 
entire party arose and sang the Marseilles Hymn in 
honor of Prof. Ferrand, and between bites sang a 
song in honor of Mr. Hornbostel and other members 
of the faculty, composed specially for the occasion. 
At the conclusion of the dinner the cup was pre
sented to the captain of the Night base ball team, 
and Mr. Sparks with a near gold medal of consider
able size.
In his speech, Mr. Hornbostle told of the import
ance of the Paris prize, and spoke of what it meant 
to the School to have one of our men in the final Of 
the contest. The future of a winner of this prize 
is absolutely assured, unless he goes completely to 
pieces for some reason. Taking up the subject of 
the relationship of faculty and students on the ques
tion of Athletics as it existed in the School of Ap
plied Design, the Patron and Dean said in part: 
Athletics should not be suppressed or aided. The 
control of Athletics by a school of Art is just as 
rediculous as an attempt to control a mans vote. 
The idea of a dignified school of Art lowering itself, 
to such a level as that of trying to regulate Athletics 
is so foolish I laugh at it.
Awarding of prizes and medals then took place. 
Mr. Janssen received a book, as did Mr. Weber. Prof. 
Ferrand was presented with a booby prize. Tele
grams were read from Biz King, and Mr. McGoodwin. Further speaker on the program were Messrs. 
Lee, Sparks, Weber, Hewlett, Janssen, and Bragman,
The Patrons Prize providing for a summers travel 
and study abroad was not announced owing to the
fact that all of the drawings in the consideration of 
the award had not been examined.
Many good solos were rendered by the Big Cinder 
of the Smoke Quartette.

Junior-Sophomore Track Meet.
Monday afternoon at Schenley oval, the Juniors 
proved their superiority by winning the much talked 
of meet. The Sophomores had more men on the 
field and at the start it looked easy for them. They 
won all points in shot put and hammer, and managed 
to get first in the half mile. Then the tide turned 
and the Juniors took about everything with the ex
ception of the broad jump.
No records were broken, but some phenomonal in
dividual work was done. Colwell won four firsts for 
the Juniors. Rex was equally prominent among 
the Sophomores. His half mile run being one of 
the features of the contest.
Prof. Thayer and Mr. Reed acted as judges. McGough also ran.
SHORTHAND IN THE UNIVERSITY.
Since the campaign to raise the standard of 
scholarship in the University has become so active 
there have come into existence many terrible hard
ships for students in the way of practically impossi
ble amounts of reading to do. Books are unavaila
ble in sufficient number in the library, and the read
ing of unlimited numbers of pages in courses requir
ing notes becomes a task of no small difficulty.
If a course in shorthand were offered in the first 
quarter of residence, students would have an oppor
tunity to acquire a means of greatly allaying the 
difficulty of taking notes on long and tedious read
ings. Writers cramp would be less of an evil and 
menace.
A working knowledge of shorthand would also aid 
the student in taking notes in lecture courses and 
valuable parts of such lectures. In fact, there are 
numerous practical uses for shorthand for any col
lege student.Daily Maroon.
I saw her first at the evening show,
My pretty girl
And she warmed my heart to a sudden glow 
And my brain to a giddy whirl.
Her cheeks were as pink as the ruddy moon,
And her hair like the shades of night,
While her eyes, tho they showed me naught of scorn. 
Were as pools of liquid light.
But to marry, my love, is against the law,
Tho her loss robs my heart of joy,
For the White Friars show was the play I saw,
And the girl I lovedwas a boy!

The battleship Indiana has undergone some tests 
of the ship brake with which she has been equip
ped. This device consists of a pair of steel wings, 
hinged to the vessels sia and normally held against 
the ship, which, when a quick stop is to be made, 
as in the case of impending collision, are released 
through mechanism controlled from the bridge. 
They swing open automatically through the forward 
motion of the ship, and it was found that the vessel 
could be brought to a stop within the distance of 
her own length without injurious shock or strain.

Through the kindness of Mr. Tarbell, the Costume 
Design Department has had the benefit of study from 
a number of original drawings from the Home Jour
nal Pattern Co. They were presented to the de
partment for the study of reproduction, but have 
proved so interesting that it has been decided to 
put them on exhibition for those who have an inter
est in Costume design. The drawings will be in the 
Studio from ten until three oclock on Wednesdays, 
Thursdays and Fridays for an indefinite period.
Pen and ink, ink wash and color are shown, and 
each drawing is accompanied by a copper plate, 
showing the method of reproduction. The drawings 
are first photographed on copper and then the light, 
or white parts are cut out with a small machine, 
leaving the ink lines prominent. In reproducing 
color as many plates are used as there are colors in 
the drawing, and is therefore the most expensive 
method of reproduction.
