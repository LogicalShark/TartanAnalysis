It is most gratifying to the manage
ment of the Musical Clubs to know 
that the, time is near at hand when the 
Clubs will again appear before the 
Pittsburgh public and our own stu
dent body, in their annual Home Con
cert in Carnegie Music Hall, and will 
entertain at their annual dance in the 
Hotel Schenley, on Friday evening, 
March 12th, 1915.
This function is of such a nature, 
though foreign to Plebes and new
comers at Tech, it has developed into 
an event long looked for from the 
early days of the school year. Not 
only do the upper classmen and friends 
who have graced thie Music Hall in 
previous years by their presence look 
forward to this day, but the incoming 
Plebes, who are seeking the tradi
tions of their Alma Mater, glean the 
various periodicals and handbooks for 
information of the big Musical Clubs 
event of the year.
. The Clubs from every point of view, 
have developed materially since the 
initial try-out in October. The suc
cess has been due to the painstaking 
and untiring effort of the Director of 
the combined Clubs, Signor Scalzo, 
who is known of old to music lovers 
in many localities. His work this 
year with tl(e Clubs, has stamped him 
as a leader in both instrumental and 
vocal music. His ideal conception of 
expression and interpretation is 
brought out in both clubs and it can 
be safely stated that his incentive can 
be based upon a precedent long estab
lishedhis efforts to please. He has 
produced a program for the Home 
Concert that could replace the offer
ing of any other large combined mu
sical club in the country. Many times 
has he changed and re-changed the 
numbers so that the whole would co
ordinate, with his exceptional ideas 
on concert work.
8he program opens with the Amici, with Bullard's Winter Song as 
a sub-number, by the Glee Club. The 
Crescendo March, one of H. F. 
Odells latest mandolin compositions 
is full of rvthm and is bound to creXtufTuchy tu ,Pbh Fs

A short time after the opening of 
classes in the fall, the initial tryouts 
were held for both mandolin and glee 
clubs, under the supervision of Sig
nor Scalzo, th.c Executive Committee 
and Mr. Schtz. Over one hundred 
and fifty aspirants for varsity rank 
appeared, and out of this number 
were selected some eighty-five or 
ninety possible claimants for positions 
on the Clubs.
Rehearsals were immediately start
ed and were carried on, every Sunday 
throughout the year, it being neces
sary on many occasions to sandwich 
a few in during the week.
On October 23rd the management 
tendered a smoker to those of the old 
club who remained from last year, 
with the invited guests consisting of 
all who had tried out for the Clubs 
this season, with several members of 
the faculty. Old songs were sung, 
speeches were made by the faculty 
members present and by the Execu
tive Committee.
In order to give the men a still fur
ther opportunity to get acquainted, 
an informal dance was given in CarXtufTuchy tu ,Pbh 5

It is not our intention to offer any 
excuses for the outcome of last weeks 
basketball games, but in justice to 
the players and the coaches, a word of 
explanation to the students can, and 
therefore, should be, gracefully given. 
Grove City, we are told, attained its 
victory during the final hundred sec
onds of play, through the kindness of 
one of the officials, while Allegheny 
and Hiram Colleges presented unbeat
able combinations. The former has 
been defeated just once on its own 
floor in the past twelve years and the 
latter has not lost a single contest at 
home during the last ten seasons. We 
cannot but admit our envy of such 
records.
Discouraging as the results of these 
three games may nevertheless seem, 
if we consider them from the stand
point of the physical endurance of the 
players, we should refrain from utter
ing any complaint or protest. Taking 
part in three strenuous contests on as 
many consecutive nights, is no mean 
task, the strain of which is bound to 
tell. The point we wish to make is 
that the fault lies in the make-up of 
the schedule. The present manager 
is not to blame any more than his pre
decessor, whose example he no doubt 
followed. Last year the two series of 
three consecutive games resulted in 
four defeats and two victories while 
the first three game series this season 
has ended even more disastrously.
From these records we are humbly 
assuming the liberty to advise the
manager of the 1916 basketball team 
who will likely be the graduate man
ager of the schools to consider more 
carefully than has heretofore been 
done, the arrangement of the contests, 
remembering to estimate in advance 
the opponents strength and to con
serve the strength of his own team 
by limiting the number of consecutive 
games to two.

Perhaps few of the students know 
and many of the professors and offi
cials do not realize that the school 
year ending in June will mark the 
close of the first decade in the schol
astic history of what is now the Car
negie Institute of Technology. Dur
ing the ten years marked changes 
have been made here both in campus 
and curricula. One who had seen 
the single group of buildings which 
opened their doors in October, 1905, 
as the Carnegie Technical Schools 
will today discover it surrounded by 
five other equally conspicuous struc
tures. A member of the initial grad
uating class 1908 will probably be able 
to find in the present four year courses 
of studies, only the surest traces of 
the former three year schedule. Not 
only in size has our school grown 
but likewise in its reputation among 
the technical institutions of the coun
try, its alumni association is becom
ing known and its graduates recog
nized.
It would be appropriate and con
ventional then that we the present un
dergraduate body, celebrate in some 
fitting fashion our tenth birthday. It 
was during the month of April, 1905, 
that ground was broken for the first 
group of Tech buildings, which now 
house the School of Applied Indus
tries, so we suggest that on an ap
pointed day in the same month in 
the year 1915, perhaps on Founder's 
Day, a monster celebration be held 
to commemorate the first ten years of 
our existence as a school. To be 
more specific and to insui*e definite 
action, we further suggest inat the 
president of the senior classes MU each 
of the four schools select a represen
tative from his school tract on a com
mittee which shall meet with a fac
ulty committee, likewise composed of 
one member from each of the schools, 
to discuss ways and means for an 
appropriate celebration. An occasion 
such as a tenth anniversary should not 
be permitted to pass unhonored and 
unsung.

While much discussion is being 
passed around regarding the organi
zation and equipment of the Union 
Club in the Central Building, it might 
be interesting to note what has been 
done at one of our sister institutions 
in the Union Club line.
Many institutions throughout the 
country have Union Clubs and con
sider them one of th/e biggest factors 
in holding students together and in 
developing the spirit that is so es
sential to a well rounded college life.
The following quotation is taken
from a letter addressed to Judge Bui 
fington from Mr. G. D. Howell, Jr., 
who is in charge of the Union Club at 
Trinity College. Mr. Howell was one 
of the most active men in his college 
during student days, being a member 
of the football team and taking part 
in many other student activities. He 
writes with a great deal of enthusiasm 
about the hopes and aims of the Club.
We sincerely hope that the Car
negie Union Club will bring about 
that get together spirit which is so 
much needed at Tech just at this 
time. We believe that Tech is on the 
eve of a wave of enthusiasm for stu
dent solidarity and we hope that it 
will bring with it a desire to serve 
Carnegie Tech first and then the indi
vidual schools.
Your letter of January 16 came 
this morning. You took such inter
est in and gave such support to the 
foundation of the Trinity Union that 
you are of course thoroughly familiar 
with it. However, at your request,
I will write down the main facts con
cerning it.
The completion of our new library 
building this past year left the old 
library rooms vacant. In June, 1914, 
the college trustees voted to turn over 
to the student body the reading room 
of the old library to be furnished and 
used as a common club room. The 
dimensions of this room are approxi
mately thirty by seventy-five feet. The 
trustees also voted a thousand dollars 
with which to furnish the room.
At the opening of college in the 
Fall of 1914, the student body passed 
a resolution to put the club room un
der tlie management of the student 
council, known here as the Trinity 
Senate. A Senate committee proceed
ed to furnish the rooms, securing by 
subscription $200.00 from the students 
to add to the $1,000.00, granted by the 
trustees for this purpose. The com
mittee used this sum to buy a pool 
table, a billiard table, card tables, ta
bles for chess and checkers, a large 
reading table, six lounges, lounging 
chairs, and so on; they upholstered 
eight deep window seats. A piano 
was rented. They also bought hand
some rugs for the floor. They made 
provision for subscription to daily pa
pers and several good magazines. In 
short, they provided an attractive and 
comfortable room. On the occasion 
of the official opening of the room, 
it was christened The Trinity Un
ion.
The Union is under the manage
ment of a committee of the Senate 
which reports through its chairman 
at each meeting of the Senate. An 
annual membership fee of a dollar and 
a half is charged. Practically all of 
our two hundred and fifty students 
have joined this year. Of course, 
there are such expenses as electric 
light, repairs, piano rental, magazine 
subscriptions; and, besides, it is de
sired to create a sinking fund for fu
ture improvements, enlargements, the 
purchase of a piano, and so forth. Th<e 
Union is open from early morning 
until eleven at night.
The nature of the Union of course 
coincides with the customs of Trinity. 
The students eat in fraternity houses,

TENTH ANNUAL HOME CONCERT
Continued from Page 1
ate favor. SIUC famous composer 
Humperdink, was Signor Scalzos 
choice when he selected The Vas
sals Farewell, a number full of 
beautiful conceptions of harmony and 
expression. The Glee Club has been 
commended upon the rendition of this 
number in the previous concerts. 
Lustspiel overture, by Kela-Bela, as 
its name implies, is replete with life 
and ginger, and the Mandolin Club 
operates all its powers in producing 
its fascinating measures. The Clubs 
are fortunate in having in their ranks 
individual voices, distinctive enough 
for good quartet material. The hu
morous and well selected numbers 
have been sung throughout this sea
son with marked success. The quar
tet is composed of J. A. Cameron, G.
B. Baker, F. L. Sharp and H. R. Hoff
mann. The final number of the first 
part of the program is Waldteufels 
beautiful waltz, Estudiantina. This 
noted composer, whose death occur
red very recently, led a life replete 
with all that goes to make up the stud
ies of a great musician. The rendi
tion of this number by the Mandolin 
Club gives a very pleasant expression 
of sentiment in the minds of all who 
hear it.
After a short intermission, the sec
ond part of the program opens, full 
of surprises. The management has 
arranged this part from a unique idea 
recently concocted by a member of 
the Clubs. The novel character of the 
presentation will undoubtedly make a 
very strong appeal. The musical 
numbers begin with Jourberts fam
ous Serenade to Juatiiti, by the 
Glee Club. This Spanish melody is
primed with the castanet effect, and 
is full of distinguishing themes char
acteristic of the Latin dances. The 
special setting of the second part 
lends itself completely to the singing 
of Carrie Jacobs-Bonds Perfect 
Day, a tenor solo by Jack Cameron, 
accompanied by the Glee Club.
Myddletons Down South, ar
ranged by Signor Scalzo especially 
for the Mandolin Club, is typical of 
old southern plantation melodies, and 
has featured in it a cake walk strain 
of superb style. The work of Mr.
H. R. Hoffman as reader for the 
Clubs has created extensive comment 
throughout the season. His reading 
deserves first mention and shows 
markedly wonderful preparation and 
broad experience along this line. Mr. 
Hoffmann will use The Road to 
Mandalay, by Rudyard Kipling.
The Mandolin Trio, composed of
Signor Scalzo, L. R. Madison, and
H. A. Madison, will give a carefully 
selected number, to which Signor 
Scalzo will play an encore. Few can 
forget the impression that Signor
Scalzos solos have left with them, in 
previous concerts. Sleep Time Mah 
Honey, by Howell, will be sung by 
the Glee Club, emphasizing the lulla
by sweetness typified by southern
mammies. After Rices Meteor 
March, by the Mandolin Club, a har
monious jingle of life and cadence, the 
Glee Club will close the concert by 
singing the Alma Mater.
In the making of successful rendi
tion it is necessary to have an accom
panist of more than the ordinary abil
ity. The Clubs have been fortunate 
in retaining the services of Mr. A. H. 
Schtz, who for two years has been 
a loyal worker for the organization.

Tuesday night, February 16th, the 
Day School played the Night School 
basketball team. Despite the lack of 
practice of the M. M. C. S. team, the 
day girls defeated the night girls with 
a score 29-1. But even this doe? not 
signify that the day girls played as 
they should. If any stranger had hap
pened to have been beyond the closed 
door he w^ould have thought some 
Fourth of July celebration was going 
on, and it was lucky that claupmg the 
hands wasnt foul for the girls on both 
teams used this signal constantly.
Our basketball has amounted to very 
little this season. It may be due to 
the long afternoon classes, but its 
time that the class teams were waking 
up and playing off their games if any 
of their girls expect Varsity sweaters.
The game with the Night School 
showed that we needed practice. Miss 
Stoner has consented to let us have 
our games in the evening, and we hope 
to get in a few weeks of good playing. 
The girls wTho played for the Day 
School on Tuesday were: Regina
Jacob, center; Margaret Wirth, side 
center; Marion Pichel, forward; 
Helen Wassel, forward; Marguerite 
Menges, guard; Marguerite Spilman, 
guard.

The regular Students Assembly will 
be changed from Wednesday to Mon
day. The assembly will be called at 
twenty minutes after one, and will ex
tend until fifteen minutes to two.
The meeting will not be entirely for 
business but a committee has been ap
pointed by Dean Breed to boost the 
spirit in the school. Of course the 
committee can not do it all. In the 
last edition of the Shilling it was 
stated that our student assemblies 
should be the cradle in which we rock 
and feed our infant school-spirit. The 
boosting committee will do all in its 
power but every girl should consider 
herself a moral quitter if she doesnt 
lend a hand to help the movement 
along.

Signor Gregoria Scalzo was born 
in Taormina, Italy, in 1884. At the 
age of nine he commenced the study 
of the mandolin under Professor G. 
Verdura of Catania. When sixteen he 
toured in concert through Argentine, 
Uruguay and Brazil as mandolin solo
ist. Returning to Europe in 1901, he 
resumed the study of music at th,e 
Leipzig Conservatorium under such 
eminent instructors as Hans Becker,
SGN. GREGORIO SCALZO
Arthur Nikisch and Richard Hoffman, 
devoting much time to harmony, 
counterpoint, composition and in
strumentation.
In 1903 he organized in Leipzig, the 
Club Silvestir, of mandolins and gui
tars, which attained remarkable suc
cess. After six years of study in this 
noted German city, he made, for the. 
second time, a successful concert 
tour in Brazil.
In the spring of 1909, Signor Scalzo came to New York, and was en
gaged as violinist with the Pittsburgh 
Symphony Orchestra, under the di
rection of Emil Paur. During the 
summer of that year he returned to 
Europe for a ten-weeks tour as man
dolin and violin soloist. He then 
joined the Pittsburgh Symphony Or
chestra, with which he remained until 
it disbanded in 1910, after which he 
played with the Pittsburgh Festival 
Orchestra.
In 1910 he became the Director of 
the Carnegie Mandolin Club, and 
through his able direction has suc
ceeded in placing it among the best 
of college organizations. In 1914 he 
also assumed charge of the Glee Club, 
with equal success in this field.
The Carnegie Musical Clubs are in
deed fortunate in possessing as di
rector a man so well qualified for the 
position.
Seniors at Purdue will not graduate 
in caps and gowns next year. This 
was decided at a recent meeting by a 
majority of four votes out of a total 
of 272 cast.

know every other student in the col
lege. Even though a man be so busy 
that he is able to spend almost no time 
in the Union, I sincerely believe that 
there is a certain benefit from the 
mere knowing that there is such a 
place for him to go to whenever he 
pleases. The benefit is shared equ
ally by the student and the college.
I might add th'at we have had one 
meeting and lecture there since the 
opening night in early December. 
Throughout the rest of the college 
year, we plan to have college and 
class smokers and meetings from time 
to time in the Union. You might be 
interested to know that the President, 
who was both a baseball player and 
billiard expert in his college days, 
may be seen now and then in the Un
ion when it is not too full, indulging 
in a quiet game of billiards. His ex
pertness in the game can of course 
be traced to his inclinations for geo
metrical lines and angles. It might 
also be of interest to know that he 
has hoped and planned for such a 
Union since he first became our presi
dent. The instituting of it this year 
was only one step in our continuous 
progress forward.
There is little else to say about 
the Union. Trinity men have always 
got together, and this Union only 
gives them an opportunity to get to
gether and be together all the time 
which is what they all want.

There are baskets in the clubroom 
at last and now that this long needed 
accessory has been secured, the Sen
ate must needs issue an edict forbid
ding our student merchants to sell 
any more of their wares in that ex
clusive market. We believe that with 
a proper regulation by those in au
thority this ruling could have been 
lessened in its vigor and still serve 
the purpose of eliminating whatever 
undesirable features may have ex
isted.
proposed pageant to be tendered Pitt 
is worthy of comment. There is a 
new era of fellowship dawning and 
here is an opportunity for everyone to 
do his share.
Monday morning, February 8th, 
Sumner Elias Fry, Industries Upper 
Class student and vice president of the 
Student Assembly, passed away at the 
West Penn Hospital after an illness 
of three weeks. Just about to gradu
ate, it is doubly a sad occurrence. 
Fry, during his career at school, made 
innumerable friends in all schools. 
Last year and the year before he 
pitched the Varsity baseball team to 
many victories and his strength will 
be missed the coming season. The 
Student Assembly sent James H. 
Clarke, a Middle year student, and 
former room-mate, to represent it at 
the funeral in Harrisburg. The Uppet 
Men appointed Henry Kreider as its 
delegate, while Carlton Parker repre
sented the Opheleum, Frys fraternity. 
All t'hese men acted as pall-bearers.
The loss Frys death incurred in 
general school affairs can only be 
comprehended by those with whom he 
was more closely associated. As vicepresident of the Student Assembly 
his efforts in making it a success, al
though not generally known, were 
very marked. As chairman of the Or
ganization Committee, he worked hard 
to get that body in shape. As a stu
dent, he was one of that kind rare to 
any institution, well up in his studies, 
bright and always willing to render as
sistance. He will be missed by all. 
His pleasant smile is with us no 
longer.
Some students persist in using tables 
other than those alloted them in our 
Beanery. The Senate promises in
stant action at the next infraction.
To hear a talk on peace devoid of 
all phantasticism, just plain heart to 
heart language, is a rare treat and the 
way Doctor Cook of the Oakland 
Methodist Church expounded the 
peace theory and its application gave 
his audience a new idea of the sub
ject. The basis of peace, he said, 
was the understanding of the lang
uage of the hearts of other men. 
His address contained many happy re
marks which kept everyone laughing. 
The whole trouble, he added, is 
that these warring nations do not un
derstand one another well enough. 
They have the same emotions, same 
customs and same love and hatred, 
but they do not have the bond of fel
lowship which should make them 
brothers instead of enemies.
The second edition of the Bagpipe, 
the Industries organ, made its appear
ance recently and the general get-up 
favorably impressed all. Numerous 
copies were sold to students of the 
other schools, the comments being 
very cordial.

negie Union on November 19th. With 
Signor Scalzos orchestra to furnish 
the music, a most enjobale time pre
vailed.
The concert season opened at Marshalsea on December 5th, where the 
Clubs rendered the most successful 
opening concert in their history. On 
December 8th, the week following, 
the Clubs appeared at the Opera
House, McDonald, Pa. A sumptu
ous chicken and waffle supper was 
served before the concert at the Pitt 
Hotel, which lent vim and zest to the 
men, preparatory to the performance.
After the Christmas holidays came 
the real hard work. The Clubs con
centrated and bent every effort 
toward the production of the Home 
Concert. Many concerts intervened; 
that of the University Club-being one 
of the most enjoyable. The Clubs
were received very hospitably at the 
Club and were given every advantage 
by its members. An appetizing sup
per was served in the banquet hall, 
during the course of which Signor 
Scalzo presented the insignia of merit 
to tlose who had earned the distinc
tion during the season of 1913-14. 
This insignia was in the form of gold 
cuff links, with the Clubs seal on the 
face.
On Wednesday afternoon, January 
13th, the Glee Club gave an informal 
concert at the Fort Pitt for the Wo
mens Club of Pittsburgh. A very 
enjoyable luncheon followed to which 
the members were cordially invited.
During inspection week, the inter
val between semesters, the manage
ment arranged a trip to Mannington 
and Moundsville, West Virginia. The 
concerts given in these two cities 
were of a nature significant of the 
general work of the Clubs. The re
ception of the Clubs work was very 
gratifying, and nothing but praise was 
given.
At Duquesne Garden, Sunday after
noon, February 7th, the Clubs took 
part in a corlcert given by the Italian 
Colony of Pittsburgh for the benefit 
of the earthquake sufferers in Italy. 
They assisted by playing and singing 
several of the best numbers in their 
repertoire, and were applauded with 
much enthusiasm.
A very interesting and diversified 
program was given at the Eighteenth 
Regiment Armory, in which the con
cert by the Clubs was the chief at
traction. Here an interesting and in
structive talk was made by J. J. Flan
nery who has recently returned from 
the war zone, which was enjoyed to 
the fullest extent by all who heard 
it. Several old members of the Clubs 
were present, each agreeing that the 
work of the Clubs this year far sur
passed that accomplished in any of 
the previous years.
Another short Glee Club program 
was given for the Queens Club of 
Pittsburgh at the Fort Pitt on Wash
ingtons birthday, after which the men 
were met in the Green Room and 
treated to a dainty luncheon.
It can be seen that the season has 
been of a very fruitful and enjoyable 
nature; with the engagements in pros
pect for the remainder of the year, 
it is safe to state that those who were 
active and fortunate enough to be 
chosen for the various concerts will 
be fully satisfied with their seasons 
sojourn into the organization. It is 
felt by the management that the year 
is replete with marked successes and 
it is thpir wish that the remainder of 
the year will be as successful as it has 
been heretofore.

A program of unique tecture was 
given by the Department of Music, in 
the theatre of the Design Building, 
Friday afternoon. The program ranked 
high as absolute music, the thematic 
contents being strong and most logi
cally developed. Mr. N. Aaron gave 
an opening violin solo,Adagio from 
Suite, Opus 34 by Ries. With this 
material he developed an intense in
terest culminating in a poetic inspira
tion. Mr. Foster gave Godards Flute 
SoloAllegretto, opus 116, in point 
of proportion and detail it was per
fect and attests to the genius of Mr. 
Foster. He was accompanied on piano 
by Miss Adele Hennig, who showed 
herself to be productive of brilliant 
technique. A piano solo followed, be
ing, The First Movement of Sonata, 
Opus 23, by Beethoven. This solo 
was given by Miss Jennie Bloom, a 
performer of profound technique and 
of pleasing rendering. These three 
were followed by a Violin SoloMr. 
Shakely. An inspiring Clarinet Solo 
by Henry Schubert and a Violin Solo, 
First Movement from Spanish Sym
phony, by Mr. Stone.
The students of the Department of 
Arts presented the play The Iphigenia in Tauris of Euripides at the 
theater in the Design Building, Friday 
evening. A large audience was well 
pleased with its presentation and cor
roborated their satisfaction by a frank 
assertion of their delight. The drama
tis personae were, Doris Williams, C.
F. Steen, Charles Duffy, Frederick 
McConnell, A. B. Williamson, How
ard Smith and Mary Blair taking the 
parts of Iphigenia, Austis, Pylades, a 
Herdsman, a Messenger, King Thoas 
and Pallas Athena, respectively.
It is a source of keen pleasure with 
which these plays are received, and its 
purpose, aside from that of profes
sional training, serves to engender 
among the listeners a more acute de
sire for sharper and cleaner plays. 
The witty and skillful manner in which 
these plays have been presented serve 
to attest the genuine artistic skill of 
the personae, and make the introduc
tion of each new presentation one ot 
acute interest.

been able to assist a few of their in

Carnegie floor representatves made 
a disastrous trip last week and lost 
three games. The team, accompanied 
by Honus and Al. Wagner, played 
to big crowds every night, Honus 
proving to be a very strong magnet 
for the country folks; at each place 
large masses turned out to see the 
mighty Teuton. It was not an infre
quent occurrence to see twenty-five 
or fifty persons following Wagner 
along the street. On all sides we 
could hear, Theres Wagner, Oh, 
you Honus, and the like. In Meadville, one enthusiast got so excited 
that he nearly broke Slaters arm try
ing to persuade Hap to introduce 
him to the German fleet. Beside 
keeping out of the way of the sight
seers, Honus and Al. were both kept 
busy taking care of the team; and 
they sure performed the task well, be
cause the coaches certainly did hustle 
to give the boys the benefit of every
thing, both on and off the floor.While 
the trip was not a success in the way 
of victories, it showed that the au
thorities that picked Wagner as coach 
have made no mistake in their selec
tion.
The principle defect brought out 
on the trip and which magnified it
self in losing the game, was the lack 
of a good steady hang back guard. 
Our scoring combination worked 
fine but our defense was poor. Un
der ordinary circumstances^ we should 
have won two of the three games, but
--------- we didnt. In two of the
games we scored more than thirty 
points, while in the other we were 
hfeld down to a paltry seventeen tally, 
a large score to be made by any team 
on the Allegheny floor. Furthermore, 
three other facts about the teams in 
play stand out prominently: 1st, Al
legheny has been defeated on her 
home floor by collegiate teams, once 
in twelve years, and then the team 
that did defeat them scored twenty 
points. 2nd, Hiram has not lost a 
game on the home floor in ten years. 
3rd, at Grove City the Home referee
ing was fine and worked wonders for 
our opponents. And the fans are 
about the most rabid anyone would 
care to meet. They are always will
ing to incite such a nice little incident 
as a riot. One can easily see how such 
a thing occurred in the recent Grove 
City-Geneva game.
The trip throughout was featured 
by the fine playing of Captain Hines. 
He played a strong, aggressive game 
at all times and kept his opponents 
well guarded. Besides playing a good 
guarding game Hines led the team 
in scoring a total negotiating eleven 
field goals. Levy, with eight field 
goals and twenty-six out of forty-one 
fouls, followed our noble Captain. The

The second Science School Stag 
Party was held in the Carnegie Union 
Saturday evening. This party was the 
fourth one which has been held since 
they were innovated a year ago, and 
it was the unanimous opinion of all 
those present that this party was by 
far the most successful one that has 
yet been held. The evenings enter
tainment was furnished by the four 
classes, the Science school faculty, 
and their respective fraus. The com
petition between the classes surely 
proved to be a success, judging from 
the movie acts, and burlesque stunts 
which were original in the extreme.
The first event on the evenings pro
gram was a minstrel show by the 
Sophomore class. Some new and very 
amusing songs and parodies were 
sprung on the assembled multitude 
and as they did not call forth a show
er of cabbages and hen fruit, it can 
safely be said that it was very well 
received.
Next the Seniors presented Quo 
Vadis Upside Down. The playlet 
opened by the army of Nero marching 
in, accompanied by their king. Nero 
being seated and his guards having 
done homage to him, he commanded 
the captain to bring on Venus, a noted 
Salome dancer, who then proceeded 
to startle the audience by l;er dancing. 
Not liking the exhibition, Nero com
mands the guards to seize her. Her 
lover comes in pleading for her life 
but he is also canned by the guards. 
The dancer was then cast in to the 
bull, who had to be substituted for the 
lion, owing that there were none in 
captivity in the Senior class, and that 
there are plenty of the others. Here 
her lover breaks away from the guards 
chases the bull, seizes him and kills 
him till he is dead, and as a reward 
he is given the life of the dancer.
The Juniors next presented a very 
novel moving picture show, called the 
Third Party, in which the heroine is 
wooed by two men, one a villain and 
the other the reciprocal of a villian. 
The villian got turned down as per 
the usual schedule, and the other 
suitor gets the chance of becoming an 
embarrassed bridegroom. The sec
ond act occurred two years later, 
when the villian sneaks in and steals 
the child, whereupon hubby starts 
out in search after a heart-rending 
scene, catches said villian, carves him 
up with a sword and safely returns 
the baby to its cradle.
The plebes then followed with a 
mock trial, at which Prof. Keller was 
charged with violating the child labor 
law. After hea~ing the evidence, the 
jury decided tl at he was guilty, but. 
the judge paroled him in the cus
tody of his wife.
This was followed by shadow tab
leaux by the W. M. F. and summer 
experiences by the members of the 
faculty, both of which were enjoyed 
very much.
Following this lunch was served in
At the end of last year, when Old 
Duke Madison, after four years close 
attention to his studies, was gradu

When-a Plebe, the Duke held the of
fice, or job, of Librarian of the Man
dolin Club, carrying, with groaning 
and gnashing of teeth, the two young 
trunks incidental to that position. He 
became manager the following year, 
which was one of the most success
ful the Clubs have ever had. In his 
senior year he was honored by elec
tion to the office of president. For 
several seasons hje acted in the ca
pacity of student leader.
At the first rehearsal of this sea
son, however, the Duke appeared on 
the scene, carrying his faithful Strad, 
with the information that he had reg
istered in the Night Post-Graduate 
Course. After much persuasion, Sig
nor Scalzo consented to allow him to 
try out for the Club. Since that time 
he has acted as assistant director of 
the Mandolin Club, and has aided ma
terially in developing this years tal

The regular meeting of the Carne
gie Student Branch of the American 
Society of Mechanical Engineers was 
held at Machinery Hall, C. I T., on 
February 10. W. C. Stevenson, C. I. 
T. 08, read a paper on The Mechani
cal Engineering Involved in Erecting 
an Electrically Driven Bar Mill. He 
gave a detailed talk on many of the 
problems which had been sblved in the 
erection of this mill, and on its pecu
liar features. For instance, the roll
ing of the bar was entirely automatic, 
no catchers being used. The paper 
was illustrated with the blue prints 
which had been used in the construc
tion of the mill. This new plant is 
part of the Duquesne Works of the 
Carnegie Steel Co.
The members were again pleased to 
be addressed by a former member of 
the society and graduate of C. rs Vs
No new business was taken up. 
After the meeting everyone enjoyed

The catalogue for 1914-15 is now 
ready for distribution at the Regis
trars Office in the Central Building 
between 3:30 and 4:30 P. M., daily, for 
day students, and on Monday, Tues
day and Wednesday evenings, from 
7:15 to 8:15 for night students. Stu
dents in the M. M. C. S. can secure 
copies by calling at Room I in the 
M. M. C. S. Building.
In spite of efforts at condensation, 
the new catalogue is the largest one 
that has been issued, due in the main 
to the increase in the facilities which 
the institution affords, all of which 
must be described at some length in 
such an official publication.
The registration this year at Car
negie Tech, as shown in the cata
logue, is 3,223, and the staff for in
struction numbers 211. Foreign 
countries are represented by 45 stu
dents as follows: Argentina 1; Aus
tria 1; Bohemia 1; Cuba 2; Denmark 
2; England 1; Hungary 1; India 3; 
Ireland 1; Italy 3; Jamaica 2; Japan 
4; Norway 1; Palestine 1; Panama 1; 
Poland 2; Russia 2; Canada 10; Scot
land 5, and Sweden 1. Forty states, 
omitting Pennsylvania, are represent
ed, sending a total of 574 students.
Registration by Schools: Science,
day 477, night 292; total 769; Design, 
day 297, night 225, total 520; Indus
tries, day 366, night 1,016, total 1,382; 
M. M. C. S., day 254, night 197, total 
451.
The catalogue calendar gives Fri
day, June 11th, for the close of the 
school year, and Commencement. The 
Easter Recess in the Science and In
dustries Schools, and the M. M. C. S., 
will be from March 26 to April 5; in 
the Design School, from April 9th 
to 19th. The next school year begins 
September 16th.
An interesting statement is includ
ed about the work of the Bureau of 
Recommendations, formerly called 
the Bureau for Student Aid. During 
the year 1913-14, 766 day students and 
186 night students were placed in po
sitions through the efforts of the Bu
reau, at wages aggregating $291,- 
589.12.
Another interesting statement is the 
brief financial one, which has not hith
erto appeared in the catalogue, al
though it has been given in detail in 
the Directors Annual Report. The 
Institute owns equipment, buildings 
and grounds, of an estimated value 
of $4,222,000, and holds productive 
funds to the amount of $8,000,000. The 
annual expenditures for the session 
1913-14 were $530,746.36.
The only notable change in en
trance requirements is that affecting 
admission to the School of Applied 
Science. Certain candidates are eli
gible to apply for exemption from ex
aminations by means of the special 
certificate plan. All other applicants 
will be required to stand the tests, 
as formerly. The new plan has been 
in operation experimentally for the 
past two years; it now appears in the 
catalogue for the first time as a regu
lar procedure. Quoted in full, it is as 
follows:
Exceptionally prepared graduates
of 1914 and 1915 from approved high 
schools or private preparatory cours
es may be granted exemption from 
entrance examinations in some or" all 
of the subjects. This exemption rec
ognizes the ability and thorough prep
aration of the individual student with
out extending the privilege of admis
sion on certificate to all graduates of 
a given preparatory school. To take 
advantage of this privilege, detailed 
information and specific recommenda
tions from the principal of the school 
are necessary. A special certificate 
blank for this purpose will be sent 
to the candidate on receipt of his ap
plication for admissions. This cer
tificate may be sent to the Registrar 
of the Institute of Technology either 
before or after the candidate com
pletes his preparatory course. If be
fore, it can be submitted during the 
second semester of his senior year 
only, and is later to be supplemented 
by a certified statement of graduation 
from the principal, a blank for which 
will be sent the applicant by the Reg
istrar.
It is urged that, whenever possible, 
candidates asking admission by this 
plan, present the necessary certifi
cates before May 1st, in order that 
time may be available for preparation 
in subjects in . which examinations 
may be required.

To sit up late at night;
And scratch your wool and shoot the

And write, and write, and write.

To deft unhood your Underwood

To put the hop in barber shop
