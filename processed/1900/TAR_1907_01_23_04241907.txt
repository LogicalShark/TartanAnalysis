The Tartan has just been able to 
secure Dr. Hamerschlags speech, de
livered at Lehigh University on Wash
ingtons Birthday at the occasion of 
his receiving the degree of Doctor of 
Science.
Director Hamerschlag spoke as 
follows:
"Dr. Brinker, Ladies and Gentlemen:
I cannot express to you in words the 
feelings which move me in receiving 
the honor conferred upon me this day 
by Lehigh University. It is an occa
sion I shall cherish and remember all 
my life, and I am particularly happy 
in the thought that my wife and son 
may have this heritage given them to 
treasure and keep alive through the 
years to come. I welcome this oppor
tunity to express my great pleasure 
and gratification in becoming an 
alumnus of Lehigh who, with her 
priceless traditions of the past, is 
keeping her place well to the front in 
the onward march of human progress 
and enlightenment, and can look into 
the future with the calm assurance of 
even greater usefulness, with splendid 
achievements in education. And let 
me say to the alumni informally and 
in a very personal way, that I deem 
it a privilege to be a brother alumnus 
of an institution which has given us 
a Charles L. Taylor. My esteem and 
affection for him grows daily and I 
rejoice that we can all emulate him, 
and "that which he represents, bofh 
here and in Pittsburg. I can
not mention his name without asso
ciating with it the names of those

Students Arrayed in Gala Dress Do 
Honor to the Schools 
Founder.
With adverse weather conditions, 
a cold, biting wind, blowing all after
noon, the Tech students dressed in 
gala attire, marched to honor' the man 
who made the great Technical Schools 
possible. Nearly one thousand men
were in line, and an impressive sight it was to see the long lines of stu
dents drawn up on both sides of the 
street in the form of a bodyguard for 
Mr. Carnegie and the distinguished
visitors, who were to pass down between the lines into the institute.
Each class as designated by a banner 
with the departments color, and the 
numerals of the year of graduation. 
As Mr. Carnegie passed he was greet
ed by a cheer from each class and 
this caused a continuous cheer of 
Rah, rah, Carnegie, along the whole 
line of march.
Mr. Carnegie asked later if the uni
forms had been purchased by the 
school. When he was told that they 
were not, and furthermore that many 
of the men who were present had 
came at a loss of a half days salary, 
he said: That is fine, the boys have 
got very close to my heart to-day. 
Mr. Carnegie has promised to make 
an especial trip to Pittsburg in the 
near future for the purpose of speak
ing to the students of the school. 
Director Hamerschlag expressed his
pleasure at the manner in which all was 
carried out during the Thursday exercises.

kind friends who journeyed here from 
Pittsburg to participate in these ex
ercises, as much to do honor to Le
high as to stand with me on this oc
casion: Mr. McConway, Judge Buf

Chancellor McCormick, Bishop White
head, Dr. Rynearson, Judge Reed, Dr. 
Holland, Dr. Crabbe, Mr. Pitcairn, 
Mr. Metcalf, Mr. Alderdice and Mr.

of their interest in the work to which
I have dedicated my best efforts and 
which bears the name of Andrew Car
negie in technical education.
If I can add to this cordial support 
the sympathy and interest of an in
stitution such as Lehigh and its Pres
ident, my friend, Dr. Drinker, to stim
ulate and encourage me to delve fear
lessly into one of the biggest prob
lems of to-day,the democracy of 
education, I shall count this day for
tunate which assures me of the sup
port of an association so numerous 
and so important as the alumni of 
Old Lehigh. This subject of edu
cational democracy is the greatest 
problem which the world must con
front in the next generation, since 
this, democracy is almost akin and 
fundamental to the development of 
those principles on which industrial 
education must be patterned. The 
The solution of this problem is not 
the question of a moment, a year or 
a decade. If it is to be solved, it must 
be approached by slow, sure and de
termined effort. The bad and the 
good must be differentiated; the use
ful from the useless, the text from 
the theory, the process from the prin
ciples, the approximate from the ex
act, and last and most important of 
all, the utilization of knowledge as an 
influence in concentrating the mind, 
-developing power and moulding char
acter. If this is conceded, then un
derlying and encompassing true ed
ucation is a democracy which is but 
the glorified expression of work.
A little more than forty years ago 
the wisdom of Asa Packer, the foun
der of Lehigh, saw this connection; 
he endeavored by means of democ
racy and work to penetrate the mist 
that had so long surrounded the defi
nition of what constituted true edu
cation; his foundation has ever been

an inspiration and a guide to those 
who are to follow him. Here to-day,
I, also, standing in the mist have 
thought I could penetrate the 
relation to and and significance of the 
word work.
Work for many centuries has been 
misunderstood and misinterpreted, 
until as we scan the pages of history 
it becomes almost synonymous with 
incapacity, slavery and degradation; 
and in some of the older countries, as 
in India, it is the burden of the beast 
and its productiveness, the right and 
prerogative of the rich and the drone.
But there have been times in the 
worlds history when the significance 
of work as an influence on the mind 
and on our ideals has not alone been 
apparent, but has even attained recog
nition.
The sculptors of Greece not alone 
conceived their masterpieces, but 
gave evidence of their mastery by the 
control of their hands and their sense 
of touch to guide the chisel through 
the marble.
The master genius of a Michael 
Angelo found expression in a dex
trous manipulation of the brush and 
paint on canvas, because the mind 
made a servant of the hands, and 
through them controlled the sense of 
feeling.
There was a period when the guilds 
of Europe reached their zenith; when 
mind and skill working in harmony 
gave position and power to those who 
could attain the standards of artistic 
merit. It was during this period that 
the physical touch of the hands gave 
that sense of form which produced the 
masterpieces in the precious metals, 
in the weaving of lace and the mould
ing of clay.
This communal life not alone ex
isted among those who worked in 
gross materials; poets wrote verse in 
the atmosphere in which poets con
gregated. Physicians studied medi
cine in a community in which their 
profession was the sole topic for daily 
discussion. These halcyon days were 
coincident with the old-fashioned, eco
nomic family, when the home was
habitation and work shop; when son 
succeeded father, and membership or 
apprenticeship was prized as a social 
prerogative of value.
It was during thisN period in history 
that every work shop and family was 
a school of industrial education in it
self; and it was also the period when 
the master minds emerged and found 
their opportunity for expression. It 
was the period when traditional work, 
and association, with its mental attri
tion in hamlet and home, permitted 
the genius of the individual to become 
the inheritor of the past.
This ideal condition for the propa
gation and development of higher 
learning and skill in communal life 
has been absolutely removed for all 
time, by the trend of our modern civ
ilization. It is no longer possible to 
retain the conditions which once ob
tained in the home and in the guild; 
but it may find a counterpart in the 
accentuated idea of the school, es
pecially those ideals which gave dig
nity and power to work in the olden 
days.
Too little thought has been given 
to the cultivation of the five senses, 
as factors in the training and exercise 
of the nerve centers of the brain. It 
is not enough to see? to taste, to smell.

EVENNESS IN HOT BLAST TEM
PERATURE.
A very important matter in blast 
furnace practice is to keep the tem
perature of the hot blast as even as 
possible. Even heat gives an even 
furnace run and uniformity of pro
duct. With the usual equipment of 
four stoves there will be no two of 
them giving exactly the same heat. 
This variation, mostly due to flue dirt 
in the stoves when there is no clean
ing of waste gases, will be shown very 
clearly in the pyrometer record. Even 
though four stoves give the same 
amount of heat, we can see in the 
pyrometer record an up and down 
movement, resulting in a saw tooth 
line, due to a stove losing from 50 to 
200 degrees in one hour. A new or 
well cleaned stove naturally loses 
less than an old or dirty one. The 
ideal record would be a straight line, 
and there are few to obtain such a 
regular heat.
We have, say four stoves on a fur
naceA, B, C and Dand we want 
an even temperature of the -hot blast 
of 1,000 degrees. Stove A is ' sup
posed to be on wind at a temperature 
of exactly 1,000 degrees. After 15 or 
20 minutes the blast will drop down a 
little. Now we open the cold blast 
valve of stove B, but only so wide as 
to bring the heat up to 1,000 degrees, 
say one-fourth. After a while we open 
the cold blast valve one-half, and so 
on until it is fully open. Then we 
go back to stove A and close the cold 
blast valve for about one-fourth, in
creasing the shut-off gradually until 
it is closed entirely. Then we take
stove C and start by partly opening 
the cold blast valve of this stove, re
peating the procedure in the other 
cases. I have seen the working out 
of this plan so that an even temper
ature of 900 degrees has been main
tained in the blast for 6 or 8 hours. 
Only two stoves were used in that 
time. The other stoves had to be 
closed in order to prevent them from 
getting too hot, and all the gas could 
.go to the boiler house. It takes, of 
course, a good hot blast man to get 
such results and to insure that there 
is no irregularity in the furnace run. 
For foundry iron, since it requires a 
very regular heat, this is especially 
desirable practice.
-------o------
The Board of Trustees of the Rens
selaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, N. 
Y., voted, at a recent meeting, to es
tablish cdurses in mechanical and 
electrical engineering. This institu
tion, which was the first where purely 
technical instruction was given in the 
English language, was founded in 
1826, and since that time has main
tained a high rank as a school in civil 
engineering. The question of broad
ening the scope has been under dis
cussion for some time, and recently 
means have been acquired through 
Mrs. Russell Sage, so that it will be 
possible to give these courses and 
maintain the high standard which has 
been set for many years in the school 
for civil engineering. Several new 
buildings and much new equipment 
have been added to the course in civil 
engineering recently. The course in 
metallurgy has been strengthened, 
and Enrique Touceda, Albany, N. Y-, 
has been elected professor of metal
lurgy.------o-------
DR. HAMERSCHLAG'S SPEECH AT 
LEHIGH.
(Continued from page 3.) 
to hear, because fundamental to them, 
and lying at the base and influencing 
them all is the great physical sense 
of feeling, which is really the parent 
of them all. A school which neglects 
to train this fifth sense omits from 
its curriculum one of the influences 
which is most effective in the devel
opment of democracy and the spirit 
of work. People are now gathered 
together in large numbers to do a 
given work in a given place. In the
mill and factory, the intense struggle 
of the great masses of .the population 
has made it impossible for the work
shop in the home to survive in crowd
ed and congested cities, and there 
does not appear to be any good reason 
why it should be re-established. But 
if there was something which the old 
economic family life produced, such 
as traditions, inspiration and social 
ideals, which are being crushed out 
by the merciless competition, by the 
piece system of production and by the 
strenuous and all-absorbing life of the 
city, it is exceedingly important that 
we should try to hold and retain that 
which was of the spirit, and let the 
form depart. We know we cannot 
resuscitate it in the factory where 
the ideal crystalizes in the selfishness 
of employer and employee, and is 
wholly measured by earnings and 
profits. We know we cannot bring it 
to life again in the family, where 
brother scarcely meets brother, where 
father and son move in different so
cial spheres,to meet perhaps in a 
single day at a single meal, and where 
the interests of those who live in the 
same family often lead in different 
directions.
It is therefore important that the 
modern educational institution con
tain those social features which make 
it possible to serve as the medium, 
through which the old traditional and 
family inspiration of the guild and 
home may find a counterpart and be 
nurtured before it is lost in the soul
less activity of the great industrial 
establishment.
It is with this feeling uppermost, 
that the Carnegie Technical Schools 
have made their effort to bring indus
trial education within the focus of this 
need. We are of the opinion that if 
the significance and the dignity of 
work is recognized as a medium 
which 'brings all social classes to a 
common level, we will secure democ
racy, and thereby inculcate the spirit 
that will produce that caste of mind1 
that type of man, that kind of woman, 
whose ideals will compensate the 
community for the loss of the old and 
much valued communal industry.
We are living in one of the finest 
countries of the world, under whose 
constitution and democratic institu
tions work has been deified. We are 
approaching that era in history when 
a man of leisurean idler, the man

who is a non-producer, is abhorred.
The school, or the educational insti
tution, which recognizes the impor
tance of work, and knits it to the so
cial life of the student, maintaining 
thereby its democracy, should have 
little difficulty in sustaining a perma
nent standard of scholarship and util
ity which soon will begin to solve one 
phase of the problem of industrial 
education. Because it is almost 
axiomatic that the student thus train
ed uses his knowledge as a tool, and 
is not concerned with the implements 
that he uses, nor the material which 
he fashions, but gives to his work a 
mental and an ideal stimulus which 
readily earns for him that satisfaction 
which comes from work well done, 
combined with happiness in the effort.

professors of the mechanical and en

March 22 for a 10 days trip to Niagara

Pa. The trip was taken as a part of 
the education of the students, who 
thus receive practical lessons in the

Falls and at the manufacturing plants 
of Dunkirk and Pittsburg.
JOURNEYMEN BANQUET.
The first annual banquet of the 
Journeymen Students, class 1908, was 
held at the Hotel Annex on last Sat
urday evening. Nearly one hundred 
and fifty of the men were present, and 
Tech spirit was rife. An elaborate 
menu was served and at 10.30 the 
speaking began.
President Patterson of the Journey
men, introduced Prof. Connelly as 
toastmaster in a neat little speech, 
after which the Professor was greeted 
with a storm of applause. He spoke 
of the modern young mens needs and 
called for the' co-operation of all in 
the grand work the Carnegie Techni
cal School is doing. After relating 
several humorous stories he intro
duced the first speaker of the evdning, 
Mr. Katzenmeyer, who delivered a 
fine address on the ^Advantages of 
Technical Schools to a Mechanic. 
Messrs. Kelley, Zellemann, Murray 
and Kane made appropriate addresses, 
after which the toastmaster called 
upon the members of the Faculty 
present for impromptu speeches. Mr. 
Afelder related several funny stories 
which were well received. Mr. Leete 
and Mr. Leeds responded with short 
talks which brought forth vigorous 
applause.
At 11.30 the Alma Mater song was 
sung and the men departed, with the 
verdict that the first banquet was a 
tremendous success.

1910
The annual banquet of the Class of 
1910 was held on Saturday evening, 
April 13. at the Hotel Henry.
Mr. J. Grote acted as toastmaster. His preliminary address was well receiv
ed. Prof. Willett was introduced and 
spoke on Good Citizenship. He was applauded enthusiastically. Next came 
Mr.- Reeds. Impressions of the Class of
1910 which were surprising to say the 
least and it is hoped the boys will profit from his kindly meant knocks. Dr. 
Hoover told the boys how the Germans 
study and of some of their strange customs. Dr. Hokanson left a gathering at 
the Hotel Schenley purposely to attend, 
and the reminiscence of his early col
lege life were very interesting as well as 
instructive. Mr* G. H. Smith of the 
class enlightened them all with his 
Views of an Engineer, which was a 
well chosen speech and showed his 
familiarity with his subject. Mr. C. H. 
Zimmermans talk 011 Fellowship had 
the true ring to it. Mr. J. W. Herrons 
 Prophesyies were grotesque to say the 
least and his method of obtaining im
pressions was original. Mr. J. L. Keehan closed the evenings talk, with a 
strong address on Technical Training. 
The singing by Messrs- Gonsidine, Sum
mers, Armstrong, Newcomer, Miller and 
George, members of the Glee Club is 
worthy of especial mention and was much 
appreciated. Mr. Schaedle of th Man
dolin Club gave a well executed piano 
solo.The banquet committee consisting of 
Messrs. Swartz, Sproitl, Grote, Greoetzinger and Lautenschlager are to be con
gratulated on the way they handled the 
affair for all voted it an evening enjoyably and instructingly soent- The speak
ers were well chosen and proved the 
subject of their addresses were in har
mony with the feeling of the class, by 
the enthusiasm displayed in the cheers 
which greeted each speaker after he 
finished.
Wait-a-Minute Swartz was present
ed with a bunch of violets by his friends 
of 2-B.
Baker was in one of his happy moods 
Saturday night and kept the boys at his 
end of the table interested during the 
course of the banquet.
Tarn and his pipe were much in evi
dence. His worried look was reflected 
in Smith's countenance.
The following resolutions were adopt
ed concerning the action of the Thistle
1 in not asking 1911 to elect a representa
tive :
We, the members of the class of 1911, 
do hereby protest against the action of 
the Thistle Board in failing to accord

' THE NEW COMMONS.
On our return to school after the 
Spring Recess we were treated to a 
very pleasant surprise. We found 
our slow accommodating friend Butch 
had gone his way (rejoicing well bet). 
The commons presents an entirely dif
ferent appearance with the snowy 
linoleum table covers, and much 
quicker service. The new cash drawer 
is also quite an improvement over the 
cigar box which did duty in former 
times. Students should remember 
that since the Commons is now under 
the management of a lady, Mrs. Sharp, 
all rough house and muddy talk 
should be deposited with the super
intendent of buildings or some other 
responsible party before entering the 
room.------o-------

for the Tech men and spoke regard
ing the cheering.
Dan Patch urged the formation of 
a class ball team and called a meet

An attempt was made to borrow 
plaid caps for some, of the Industrials, 
but the response was not enthusiastic.
After a little disorder the class set

REVIEWS.
Speaking of the extension of Amer
ican foreign trade, a writer in The 
Iron Age says:
Should the day come when the 
American manufacturer needs a for
eign outlet he will find that it takes 
time to establish it. It is not like 
sending a salesman to Chicago or St. 
Louis, where his goods are estab
lished, and which points may be 
reached in 18 to 24 hours. We must 
remember that we are 36 days from 
Bangkok, 32 days from Shanghai, 33 
days from Hongkong, 25 days from 
Melbourne and 26 days fr.om Calcutta.
Steamers to these countries run on 
an average twice per month, so when 
we take into consideration the delay 
in departuYes on each end. and the 
going and coming of mails it takes, 
say, three months to get a reply from 
Bangkok, even if the merchant is suf
ficiently enthused to send an order 
immediately. But the foreigner is a 
procrastinator, and he may want two 
or three months to think it over.
Then, too, we must learn the habits 
of foreigners. We must learn that a 
Chinaman will not give a written or
der, for he thinks his word as good 
as a bond. It is acknowledged that
a Chinese merchant considers his 
business obligations as sacred as his 
Confucius or his Buddha. It is a 
prison offense to fail.
We must learn that the German or 
Frenchman can best be reached 
through their stomachs, the English 
and Scotch through their managerial 
dignity. They are not as accessible 
as we are. It is a case of ringing door 
bells and waiting in an ante-room af
ter the card is sent in until it pleases 
his managing directorship to receive 
his visitor.
The American seems to overlook the 
fact that English is not spoken every
where. We may find in Germany that 
many of the larger merchants and 
manufacturers speak English as well 
as we do; still if \^e could address 
them in their own language we could 
get much closer to them.
The study of languages should be 
taken up in earnest. In Germany, 
English, French and Spanish are 
spoken in most any business concern 
of importance, but if we are .to be a 
progressive, industrial nation and set 
out to conquer the world we should 
not be content with these, and sho\ild 
add Japanese; Russian and Chinese. 
These added to those mastered by 
Germany would carry us around the
world. While we as Americans are 
not enthusiastic in the study of lan
guages, our weakness in that direc
tion may be overcome.
There are in our large universities 
students from Japan, Russia, China, 
Java, India, Siam, &c., most of them 
sons of rich men. Any manufactur
ing concern could secure the services 
of three or four of these at a nominal 
figure, as they are eager to learn our 
business methods. They could be in
duced to serve for one or two years, 
and they would be helped in many 
ways.
Being sons of rich and influential 
sires they may be the means of estab
lishing business connections with 
their countries, which would prove 
profitable to those employing them. 
Such students would not be more ex
pensive than our own young men, and 
having educational advantages, speak
ing our language, &c., they Could be 
employed in most any clerical ca
pacity, besides translating letters 
coming from or writing letters to 
their respective countries. I venture 
to say that any such young man could 
influence sufficient foreign business 
to balance his salary account.
These young men of good birth and 
education would also exert an incal
culable influence on our young men, 
for all nations have characteristics 
which are worthy of our consideration. 
We ourselves are known the world 
over as the strenuous branch of the 
human family, so the German stands 
for military precision, the Chinaman 
for commercial honor, the Japanese 
for exceptional detail, the Englishman 
for birth and conservatism, the Rus
sian for his awe of law and authority.
We Americans glory in our achieve
ments, are patriotic, but the average 
American 'seems to think that the 
worlds boundary is the Atlantic 
Ocean on the east and the Pacific on 
the west.
Do not let us forget that we have 
a population of nearly 90,000,000 peo
ple to a territory of 3,751,214 square 
miles. Russia has a territory of some 
8,660,395 square miles and a popula
tion of some 135,000,000 souls, while 
China has a territory of 4,277,170 
square miles and a population of 426,- 
447,325.
Is it worth our while to study the 
wants of these people? As we have 
conquered the problem of manufac
turing at a minimum cost, is it not
