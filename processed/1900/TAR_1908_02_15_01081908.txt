In a hotly contested game of hockey at the Duquesne Gardens last Sat
urday evening, the Tech hockey contingent went down to defeat before the 
Troy boys. From the beginning of the play the game was fast and furious, 
and up to the last few moments of the first half, might have been called any
bodys game. At one time the skirmishing would continue for several min
utes around the plaid goal, only to be reversed in the next few moments to 
iierce play in the Rensselaer territory. During the second period the Troy 
men played almost entirely upon the defensive and neither side scored, though 
cr one or two occasions it seemed certain that Close would land the puck in 
the net. For Tech no man shone particularly above his mates and all played 
a good hard game, the only criticism perhaps being a marked tendency to 
 rough up things unnecessarily. For Rensselaer Fleeger did well. Line-up:

Lowell W. Nicols, Editor.
My think tank boiled over one night 
last week and the following are a few 
of what slopped over. After doing the 
sleep walking scene from Macbeth, 
much to the alarm of the entire neigh
borhood, it seems I happened to sit 
down at my typewriter, at all events, 
the results of whatever followed are 
here given:
Newport, L. I., Aug. 17, 1908. 
My Dear Nick:
I simply cannot resist the tempta
tion of telling you, now that I have a 
few spare minutes on my hands, of 
the swell time I have been having 
here, ever since 1 arrived three weeks 
ago. At first I thought that the best 
thing for me would be to take a much 
needed rest and get away from the 
strenuous life for a while. That is 
why I chose Newport^ for they say, 
that when a man is unknown, and 
does not give immediate evidence of 
being one of those bloated million
aires that are so common nowadays, 
he can spend the loneliest time here 
of anywhere in the United States. But 
Nick, dont you believe it for a min
ute. To make a long story short, this 
is the way it happened: You see, one 
morning I was walking down the street 
alone when a runaway automobile 
came dashing along! With all the 
latent thoughtfulness that an educa
tion at Tech provides I wa able to
perceive even when the mad car was 
at a considerable distance down the 
street, that the trouble was with the 
spark system. Quick as a flash, Nick, 
I remembered that it 13 personality 
after all that counts, and stepping to 
the center of the road I simply re
cited Ohms Law, and the effect was 
instantaneous. The car stopped 20 
yards away. You see it was the Van 
Astorbi'lts machine with his nibbs in 
the front . seat. See any edition of 
Diamond Dick for what followed.
Yes, Im the whole thing now, and 
Ive got about fifty peaches on my 
string now. If this popularity busi
ness keeps up Ill have to get a rope 
to hook them to.
Yours as ever,
Geyer.
(This was in the form of a telegram).
,Squeedunk, Nev., July 4, 08.
L. W. Nickolas:
Sir: My pappa allows me to use
his files now.
Brillhart.
Oil City, Pa., July 19< 1908. 
Dear Nick:
Of course, you know its strictly 
against my principles to write letters 
and do other irregular acts on Sun
day, but J. R. Jones is out with three 
girls, and I know the recording angel 
is too busy trying to keep up to him 
to pay any attention to me. What do 
you think of asking a fellow up to see 
you, and the rest of the tanks (oil 
tanks) introduce him to your lady 
friends, only to be polite, and then to 
have him butt right in and start buzz
ing the wrong gal. If he doesnt soon
stop it I think the only thing to do 
will be to feed him one of these oil 
soaked bananas we have up here, to 
consolidate his lungs for him and 1 
bet that will fix him. Must close, as 
I hear the patrol wagon coming up 
street, and somebody in it making a 
noise like J. R.
Your friend
Wolffi.
Louisville, Ky., Aug. 23, 1908. 
My Dear Old Fellow:
You know down in our High School 
is the place to have a good time. Since 
I have been here there have been 
banquets galore with speeches, the 
real thing I mean. A lot of my old 
pals gave me one the other night that 
was about the best ever, and we had 
speeches after every course, too the 
way they ought to be. It certainly 
is great to be popular, and a fellow 
can have all kinds of a time down 
here with our old High School bunch. 
Dont fail to write me of anything of 
interest that happens. Hoping to see 
you in September, I remain,
Most cordially yours,
Borschneck.
Chautauqua, N, Y., June 30, 1908. 
Mr. L. W. Nicols,
Sewickley, Pa.:
Dear Sir: I write to inform you
that I have just accepted the position 
of Gentral Lecturer on Science in the 
assembly. The position calls for one 
well versed in all the subjects relating 
to science that are of general interest 
at the present time. It also includes 
taking charge of several classes in 
mathematics, and one in chemistry.

It seems that the management decided 
tQ have one person fill the places that 
have before, been filled by several men 
and in this way be able to keep him 
on the grounds all the time in case 
anything arose requiring the immedi
ate attention of a general scientist. 
Since the season does not close this 
year until the latter part of Septem
ber, I will not be able to be in Pitts
burg until that date.
Yours very truly,
Banker.
Our old friend, Ashe, visited the 
schools before Christmas vacation, and 
reports clear sailing in his new field 
of work. He is finishing out the year 
in his Old High School, and will enter 
the Theological Seminary next fall.
Hune, late of Section E, who was 
taken home several weeks ago sick, 
has improved immensely, and will 
spend the rest of the year in Cuba. 
He expects to be located near Ha
vana, and will probably keep up some 
of his studies there, returning to Tech 
in the fall.
Mr. Robert C. Carter, Jr., familiarly 
known as Nick Carter, goes to Vir

stay with us, and wish him all kinds 
of luck.

The Hockey Situation at Tech.
When school closed for the Christ
mas holidays, practice had only fairly 
begun, so that the students who 
were interested in the progress of 
practice and the selection of the team 
were somewhat in the dark as to re
liable information. At first, about 
twenty men signified their intention 
of trying for places on the team by 
signing the notice on the schools 
bulletin board. But when the trial 
came only about fifteen men showed 
up for the first practice. Rumors 
have been heard that there are sev
eral star men in the night school
THE TARTAN
who did not even try because they 
imagined that night men did not have 
a show, and that the team was picked 
any way, etc. The fact that some of 
the best players on the team are night 
men would disprove these conditions 
if enough consideration were given 
them.
The G-arden management were very 
kind in allowing the team about six 
practices a week, two of them being 
at night, so that the night men would 
have a chance. Bright was disabled 
in practice about two weeks ago dur
ing a practice with P. A. C., and con
sequently was able to play only about 
ten minutes in the game on Saturday 
night. Low, who took his place, is a 
night man and showed up well in 
practice. Capt. Charles was slightly 
ill early in the week, and it was 
feared would be unable to play. Those 
who saw the game know that it was 
a hard fought one and that the luck 
was with Rensselaer.
It is hoped that a game can be se
cured with the Varsity Grads^ a fast 
local organization, and with a team in 
Cleveland. We expect the season to 
be a successful one in spite of the fact 
that we can not play every week.

McCorkle, 10, had a most remarka
ble experience during his recent visit, 
to New York City, which, if the de
tails be learned, bids fair to rival the 
kissing exploits of the hero of the 
Merrimac. As he recounts it, it was 
during a visit to a certain hotel that 
is reserved exclusively for members 
of the other sex. Directly upon being 
ushered into the reception room of 
the hostelry, he was set upon by a 
host of the fair guests, who each in 
turn planted a kiss on his blushing 
cheek. After he recovered from his 
surprise he was told that the proceed
ing was the result of a dare, that re
quired every girl to kiss the first man 
who crossed the threshold. Mac 
doggedly refuses to divulge the name 
of the hotel.? ? ?

6THE TARTAN
A. F. Stamm, Editor.
The Social Committee of 1911 is 
still patting itself on the back over 
the success of the smoker.
Mr. Workman is an able speaker 
and a clear thinker. He was in the 
debate for fun and had it at the ex
pense of 1910.
Hess is out again after a short ill
ness. He was just sick enough to 
miss the smoker.
How about a dance for the next so
cial stunt, 1911? The Social Commit
tee of 1911 is deliberating upon such 
an affair and they will no doubt be 
heard from at an early date.
For a good time consult the ener
getic committee representing 1911 in 
rough house parties smokers and 
such like.
The news of the death of Mr. C. 
W. Howards mother reached Pitts
burg during the holidays. We extend 
our deepest sympathy to Mr. Howard 
in his bereavement and are very sorry 
that we were unable to furnish some 
tangible proof of our sincerity.
Messrs. R. W. Locke, of the night 
school, and Paul Flynn, of the day 
school, were elected to membership 
in the Tau Kappa Fraternity.
At the hockey game Saturday even
ing the Tech rooters were nearly all 
night men. In the noisy party were 
found President Helm, of 12; Presi
dent Stamm, of 11; Vice President 
Hess and Secretary Cline, also of the 
latter named class. They were all for 
Leety (and then the others.)
1912 is still wrangling over their 
elections. The athletic championship 
was the < chief bone of contention, 
Newel and McGowan being the con
tenders. Mac won out and is no doubt 
the man for the place, as he can play 
some foot-ball and hockey. (Ask 
1911.)
Score another triumph for 1911. 
On the evening of December 20, 07, 
they demonstrated that they are up 
to the minute in the arrangement and 
management of social affairs. Their 
smoker was a very successful venture 
in every respect and one of which 
the committee and the class may well 
be proud. The affair was run off 
without a hitch, nor was there any 
unpleasantness to mar the sport which 
lasted without interruption nor delay 
from 9.30 until 12 oclock.
The committee wishes to express its 
gratitude to the many students and 
others who contributed to the success 
of the affair. They wish to thank the 
members of the faculty and the classes 
of 10, and 12 particularly, for the 
services rendered, and a formal ac
knowledgment will be made at the 
next class meeting.
The program was run off exactly as 
advertised and the excellence of each 
number justified the use of the many 
superlatives which appeared in the 
advance notices.
The wrestling bout was a very good 
one, being strenuous and scientific. 
McCully, the victor, was perhaps the 
more aggressive, but Burton, his op
ponent, was in the game at all stages 
and the fall which occurred after 11 
minutes was as much the result of 
limited mat space as skill on the vic
tors part. Burton took the decision 
of the referee philosophically and was 
among the first to congratulate the 
conqueror. A silk pennant was the 
trophy which the committee offered 
the victor.
Mr. Fosters lecture on Europe was 
perhaps the bright feature of the pro
gram and rivaled the wrestling bout 
in popularity. Owing to the short 
time in which he had to give his lec
ture, Mr. Foster was compelled to cur
tail it to such an extent as to cover 
in detail only the trip across the ocean. 
Some time, when Mr. Foster gives the 
whole cf his lecture illustrated by 
pictures taken at various points, there 
will be a humorous literary treat in 
store for lovers of something really 
instructive and entertaining.
The inter-class debate was won by
1911 and the decision was the result 
of a very short deliberation on the 
part of the Messrs. Conley, Lowe and 
Morris, who were the judges. The 
arguments put up by R. iS. Cline and 
Mr. Workman, of 1911, were too much

for the Messrs. Taylor and Considine, 
who represented 1910. Our esteemed 
friends from 1910 dispute the decision 
of the judges, but the argument was 
won on its merits, as any unbiased 
auditor will testify. Music was ren
dered by H. M. Smithe, of the Glee 
Club; M. J. Scheidlmeir, of the Man
dolin Club, and L. Schaedle, also of 
the latter named club. The perform
ance of Mr. Scheidlmeir was perhaps 
the most brilliant, as it was solo 
work on the mandolin and without ac
companiment. When it is considered 
that he held three hundred students 
practically spell-bound for four min
utes, some idea of the magnificence 
of his performance may be obtained.
Mr. Laithe was in good voice and 
his two songs were enthusiastically 
received. Leo Schaedle, of 1910, gave 
a piano solo which was a medley of 
fifteen popular airs. The guests join
ed in singing the familiar parts of the 
airs, and that being the case, the 
writer is in: doubt as to whom to give 
the applause which followed Mr. 
Schaedles performance.
Other features were addresses by 
Director Hamerschlag, Capt Hender
son, President Smith, of 1910, and 
President Stamm, of 11.
-oIntercollegiate Athletic Standing,
Yale leads the universities of Amer
ica in the number o fintercollegiate 
athletic championships her teams have 
won during the year of 1907. Out of 
21 sports in which the eastern colleges 
have held championship meets the 
Elis are supreme in six, and if Yale 
chose to dispute Cornells right to the 
rowing honors, she could claim a tie 
in this sport. Yale was first in foot
ball, basket-ball, shooting, water polo, 
wrestling and golf. But in justice to 
the Elis it should be said that there 
were four of these sports in which 
they did not compete.
Cornell ranks next to Yale in the 
number of championships won. If 
each inter-collegiate championship 
were counted as one the standing of 
the eastern colleges would be as fol
lows: Yale 6, Cornell iV2, Pennsyl
vania 2, Columbia 2, Haverford 1, 
New York university 1, Annapolis 1, 
Harvard 1. The following table gives 
the result of the championship fights 
in 21 sports:

Otto C. Schneider, president of the 
Board of Education of Chicago, will 
introduce a resolution at the next 
meeting of the board prohibiting fur
ther existence of fraternities and so
rorities in the city high schools. Prof.
E. G. Oooley, superintendent of the 
Chicago schools, is strongly in favor 
of abolishing the frats as tending to 
vice.
;Several new men have entered the

Much good base-ball material is in

---------o
INDUSTRIALS
Sihinney seems to have taken the 
place of hockey among the lower class
men. An exciting game took place 
on the tennis courts the last Friday of 
school, the Plebes and Industrials 
fighting for honors. The features of 
the game were Mullens frequent sit
ting positions and Mercers goal tend
ing. Red Hatcher and Long-hair
ed Cassidy, of the Plebes, also dis
tinguishing themselves.
Frampton and Robinson figured 
prominently in a expensive fracas in 
the foundry recently. Ask Frampton.

strict disciplinarian whose, lets have

devotion to the square deal policy 
which frequently takes the form of 
nosing an F into a P for a Plebe 
who needs it. He as yet has not had 
a fond pseudonym added to his Chris

student body can find no idiosyncracies that might aid him in becoming 
a member of those well-filled ranks

result of the recent arrival of a 
bouncing baby girl who is doing fine

Student Attendance at Athletic Con
tests.
The percentage of the student body 
that turns out to see the minor sports 
of Carnegie Tech is lamentably small. 
We refer to basket ball, hockey, and 
track sports. Saturday night the 
hockey team played a game (as a few 
know by this time), and losit. The 
score was not large, and conditions 
were somewhat against the team, but 
a large and noisy crowd of rooters 
would have helped matters a little by 
ridding the players of some of their 
nervousness. There were nearly as 
many night men out as day students, 
but the number was not what it should 
have been. On next Friday evening 
the basket ball team goes up against 
Wup. This is our chance to avenge 
the defeat of the foot-ball team last 
season, and we are sure to do it if 
the students show the players that 
they are behind them.-----o-----
Mechanicals Make a Trip.
On Saturday evening, December 21, 
the Senior Mechanicals, under the 
guidance of Prof. Trinks and Mr. Setz, 
paid a visit to the power plant of the 
Phipps power building. The plant is 
operated to furnish electricity, heat< 
and hydraulic power to buildings in 
the vicinity. The Gayety and Alvin 
theaters get their electric power, the 
Fulton building is supplied With elec
tric and hydraulic power, and the 
Bessemer building is lighted and heat
ed by the Phipps Co. This is not a 
complete list of the customers, as 
many small stores are supplied.
The main generating units are two 
Westinghouse vertical engines, direct 
connected to dynamos having - a ca
pacity of 1,000 K. W. One of the 
units is used at a time, the load, not 
being large enough to demand the 
power of both. The main engine 
room contains a number of smaller 
engines of different makes and also 
some fly-wheel hydraulic pumps which 
pump water at a pressure of 750 
pounds to the Fulton building for use 
in the elevators. One of the new en
gines had just been installed to fur
nish electric power for operating 
electric elevators in the new building 
being erected on the site of the old 
natatorium. The boiler feed pumps 
and accumulator are in the basement 
of the building. The boilers are above 
the engines; a position made neces
sary by the frequent high floods to 
which that section of Pittsburg is sub
jected. The boilers are fired by 
chain grate stokers which receive the 
coil from overhead bins by means of 
the customary chutes. The coal is 
handled by an elaborate system of 
conveying machinery built by Heyl & 
Patterson. The company sells ex
haust steam for heating purposes, so 
that the plant is a very economical 
one.
The plant for the Allegheny County 
Light Company at 13th street was 
next visited, but the stay was a short 
one.

At a recent gathering of several of 
the members of the Applied Science 
Faculty a very wordy discussion was 
entered into relative to the best form 
of exercise. Many different varieties 
were discussed, but especial enthu
siasm was shown when horse-back 
riding was suggested. It was ven
tured by one of the assembly that de
spite the fact that the virtues of rid
ing were greater than any other type, 
it was completely out of the question 
for the faculty to consider it. Where 
could they get the horses? One of 
the wits in the gathering, who knew, 
as we all do, that the Physics Depart
ment has 'little difficulty in getting 
anything it wants, said: Ill tell you, 
well get Prof. Gibbs to put in a requi
sition for a carload of horses.* *

Electric Traction in the Shop.
The history of handling material 
in the workshop is an interesting ex
ample of gradual development and 
growth. Formerly cranes, mostly of 
the jib variety, and constructed large
ly of wood, were used in the foundry 
only, and the labouring gang formed 
a large, expensive, and unsatisfactory 
element in shop operation. Then the 
crane gradually worked its way into 
the machine shop, and even in its 
early, hand-operated types, gave much 
relief and saved much time. The de
velopment of the electric travelling 
crane is a matter of recent shop his
tory, and to-day no new shop is 
planned without provision for run
ways for travellers in nearly every 
department, as well as overhead tramrail and general handling equipment.
In he meantime, there has grown 
up another department of handling 
machinery, equally advantageous, effi
cient and important, that of indus
trial railways and their equipment. 
The industrial railway is to the sur
face what the overhead traveling 
crane is to overhead shop transport, 
with the additional advantage that it 
includes what may be termed intershop transport. The tracks may be 
laid to deliver to the innermost de
partments of each shop, and also 
cover the ground from one building 
to another, and thus unite an entire 
establishment into one operative 
whole.
When such an installation is of lim
ited extent, and the loads are light 
and not too frequent, manual labor 
may be used for propulsion, and this 
method is very generally used within 
the shop for many purposes. The 
ease of running and the light resist
ance- with well-made cars and track 
reduce the effect so greatly that even 
in this way the laboring force re
quired may be diminished to a great 
degiree. Electric 'traction, (however, 
has made its way into this department 
of transport, as it has in nearly every 
other department of industry, and the 
electric locomotive Is now nearly, as
familiar an object in the large shop 
as the electric crane.
For shop use the storage battery 
system has shown itself eminently 
adapted. Overhead wires are im
practicable, except in a very few 
instances, and since one of the great 
advantages of the industrial railway 
and electric locomotive lies in its 
service in transport between the vari
ous departments of an establishment^ 
both within doors and without, no 
system can be acceptable which is 
not equally well adapted to both sit
uations. For this reason the electric 
storage locomotive has been devel
oped into a machine of great utility 
and efficiency in the handling of heavy 
material in and about the shop. Such 
a machine is capable of handling raw 
material, such as pig iron, sand, rough 
castings, etc., as well as finished 
parts, and completed products ready 
for shipment, the only requirement for 
this varied service being the provision 
of the different kinds of cars required 
for the purpose.
As in the case of the traveling
crane, the economy of this mode of
handling material is hardly appreci
ated until it has been tried. The vis
itor to the modern shop, if formerly 
acquainted with old-time methods, 
cannot fail to be surprised at the 
small number of men employed in 
other than productive work. The la
boring gang is conspicuous by its ab
sence. A man in a cab of an over
head crane, an operator on the plat
form of an electric locomotivethese, 
and a few men on the floor to handle 
slings, hooks and attachments, will be 
found doing all that formerly re
quired a large body of men.
Apart from the immediate advan
tages attaching to the use of machin
ery in the place of human muscular 
effort, there are other considerations 
of importance. It is always desirable 
to avoid the employment of severe 
physical effort whenever possible, re
serving the intelligence of men for the 
conduct of work requiring skill and 
judgment rather than brute force.

Try to act as if you had not ex

The editor expects to get quite a

said the Pittsburg girls are not at all 
slow; and then some of those boys of 
1912 are real cute and awfully nice, 
too.
Now for some hard work to make 
up our deficiencies.
The Class of 1912 wishes all her 
friends a happy and prosperous New 
Year. The greetings are none the 
less sincere because a week old. Like 
good whisky and fruit-cake, they 
rather improve writh age.
The only thing which marred the 
fun of 1912 at the smoker was the 
absence of our president. Where 
were you, Helen?
The social committee has not been 
heard from yet, so it is not possible 
at this date to give yau any informa
tion as to what sort of a social stunt 
1912 will pull off. What have you 
been doing, Griffith? Start something 
and let us hear about it.
A New Years resolution for Helm. 
Resolved, That when I am on the pro
gramme for a speech, I will not, here
after be sick in bed.
Besides revealing to us the beauty 
in our midst, the last night of school 
opened our eyes to an orator amongst 
us who is perhaps only excelled by 
that better known Pittsburger, P. C. 
Knox. Mr. McEligan is the gentle
man. He delivered a short after-din
ner speech in English that Friday 
evening thatwell, I bet you couldnt 
do it again, Mr. McE.
The next regular class meeting will 
be held in the General Assembly room 
at 10.30 P. M. next Friday. This 
meeting was postponed from January 
3 on account of there being no school 
on that date. The new officers will be 
installed, the question pf a class motto 
and other important business will be 
discussed, so dont fail to be on hand. 
The class is now well organized and 
much interest and spirit have been 
aroused in our class affairs. Now 
that the hardest work is over do not 
let our enthusiasm die out. Speaking 
of class spirit, it will not be out of
place to refer you to Lowell Nichols 
article on that subject in the last 
number. You will be amply repaid 
for the time spent in looking your 
copy up and reading it.
McGowan says that he intends still 
going to school, even if she does pop 
the question this year.
Yes, thank you, 11, we had a jolly 
good time. If you cant win at foot
ball you are successful as hosts. 
Those who failed to attend the smoker 
missed more than two bits  worth 
of fun.
Lonergan, the man who stood next 
to Peebles, is a 12 man. It was not 
generally known that the Lonergan of 
the beauty contest and the one in our 
class were the same, or the result 
may have been different.
Let us hope that the year ahead of 
us will prove the fallacy of the old 
adage of our forefathers that a green 
Christmas means a fat graveyard. 
The grim reaper has already called 
two of the night students this year; 
may we be so bold as to hope that he 
will not visit us again?
Heres to the continued success of 
our dearly beloved school during the 
year one thousand nine hundred and 
eight. And heres to the Class of 
1912; may she always go forward, 
never falter nor go backward.

THE TARTAN
To Young Men About to Become Min
ing Engineers.
(An informal address delivered before 
the mining students in the University 
of California on October 2.)
Instead of directing your attention 
this evening to technical subjects, I 
choose to discuss, in a practical way, 
certain elements of success in the 
chief work for which your training as 
mining engineers is given. The func
tion of the consulting engineer is very 
attractive, so dazzling sometimes in its 
rewards that the chief ambition of 
young men is to leap suddenly into 
that select company, only to find them
selves handicapped by inexperience, 
and thereby doomed to failure. To 
aim at becoming a consulting engineer 
is well enough, but to become an effi
cient manager is equally meritorious. 
The profession of mining engineering 
enjoys a peculiar distinction; it relates 
to a business which is fundamental in 
the progress of the world. The only 
original sources of wealth are the pro
ducts of agriculture and mining. All 
else is man-made; these two are fun
damental, pristine, the really - indispensible necessaries of the human 
race. To be an intelligent director of 
such effort, to enlarge the possibilities 
of successful development in these 
fields of human endeavor, is certainly 
an inspiring occupation.
The first and proper aim of the 
young mining engineer then should be 
to attain the position of an efficient 
manager. Let force of circumstances, 
the renown of your proven ability to 
obtain practical results lead to the call 
which shall thereafter make of you an 
adviser rather than a director. There 
is honor enough as manager; the as
cent to that level is arduous and gen
uine successes are few. An adequate 
technical preparation is t be assumed. 
You are acquiring that here. But ex
perience, you are not getting in the 
University. The magnificent labora
tory equipment of our greater institu
tions to-day often tricks young men 
into the belief that they have ob
tained a' ready-made experience; a 
sort of ready-made garment which 
they have donned under the impres
sion that it is a sufficient wardrobe 
for the varied functions of practical 
life. It is a ready-made garment, and 
a very good one too. It clothes the
nakedness of your theatrical tech
nology, so that you may enter upon 
the duties of your profession without 
that crippling sense of shame with 
which the graduate of 25 years ago 
was obliged to face the mechanism 
which he had set out to govern. More
over it has materially shortened your 
period of probation. Be thankful for 
it, but not vain of it.
The engineer to-day, just as in the 
past, must start low if he aims high. 
The short cut is dangerous; it involves 
a steeper gradient, and your wind 
may give out before you reach the top. 
A year or two spent in the commoner 
work of actual mucking, drilling, ma
chine-drilling operation, timbering, 
hoisting, mill-repair or construction, 
boiler and engine tending, amalgam
ating, furnace feeding, converter op
erating, and the like, is the best possi
ble preparation for sure and steady 
promotion. It enables you to learn 
liow things are done, how much a 
man can do, and what he cannot do; 
it also subjects you to the hard school 
of discipline, for the best training for 
the responsibilities of control lies 
through being governed. This in
volves absolute respect for the gov
erning power. Do not .criticise your 
manager; work for his interests; con
ceive him to all intents and purposes 
to be the company itself; sustain 
him; help to hold up his hands in ab
solute loyalty, trusting that he best 
knows what is for the companys 
higher interest.
But no one perceives, perhaps, that 
the manager is making the best of his 
conditions under the limitations of his 
exchequer. He is working for the 
grand economic result. He may real
ize the imperfections in the details 
more keenly than his critics, and as 
fast as he can he will remedy them. 
Trust him, and help him.
Dont seek promotion; let promotion 
seek you. Many managers regard it 
as the part of wisdom to discharge a 
man who clamors for advancement, 
and the most experienced manager 
will never promise nor even hint at 
promotion until the day when he rec
ognizes merit by pushing the man 
ahead. Seek to be useful, not valu
able. The man who seeks to be use
ful measures his achievements by the 
standard of excellence of work done; 
the other applies a monetary scale to 
his labor, in which his measurement

may err. You will be valuable enough 
if you first become useful. Herein 
lies the great distinction between 
meekness and self-sufficiency. It is 
written, the meek shall inherit the 
earth, and it is true. Meekness does 
not mean monkish self-abasement. It 
implies the quality of taking your eyes 
off yourself; in not exalting yourself, 
but in directing your attention to the 
honesty and perfection of your per
formance. The meek man lives for 
the glory of what he can produce, not 
for the glorification of himself as an 
officiously free-willing ego.
Good w'ork is facilitated by com
posure. You may work swiftly, but do 
not be hurried. Find that pace at 
which you can work steadily without 
excitement, and yet swiftly enough to 
keep your faculties up to an efficient 
heat. Finally, keep your philosophy 
to yourself. Deal consistently in 
facts, and aim at practical results in 
a wrorld which esteems most the man 
who makes his contribution square 
with reality rather than with theory.
Test your air-compressors; your 
electric motors. Economize your 
power. Most power plants are opeiated carelessly and inefficiently, even 
when the engine-man keeps his brass 
glistening and his linoleum spotless, 
and brags about his department. Sub
ject your power-transmission equip
ment to an equally searching investi
gation. Be sure that your shafting is 
in alignment, your bearing-boxes well 
babbited, clean, and oiled; your belts 
in good condition and free from slip 
on pulleys. Examine the mechanism 
of all machines. Hunt for powerlosses throughout your entire works. 
There scarcely exists a plant in which 
you will not be abundantly rewarded 
for your pains. Dont search for cu
rious and fancifully technical ways of 
showing your superiority. Drive 
straight for the simple fundamental 
things. There is the wide fertile field 
which most men neglect. There is 
where you will commonly raise your 
larger crop of betterments. It may 
be less spectacular than to tear out a 
quantity of costly machinery and in
stall a new process, but its effects as 
shown on your balance sheet will carry 
comfort to that majority in the board 
of directors which placed you in you 
in command, and will emphasize the 
the difference between competent and 
incompetent management.
Sort your scrap-heat. At an old 
plant it will usually prove a mine of 
wealth. Then lake steps to prevent 
undue additions to it. Under ineffi
cient management the scrap-heap 
grows like a graveyard during a pes
tilence, and incompetency is a pesti
lence; it is highly contagious; it 
sweeps from the mine-boss through all 
ranks, down to the shoveler on the 
tailing dump. Tools become lost, 
buried in the dirt; pulleys, parts of 
machines, valves, pipe fittings, bear
ings, bolts, nuts, are tossed into cor
ners until they obstruct operations, 
and then the roustabout wheels them 
to the scrap-heap. The prevention of 
this waste, and of the indifference 
which it breeds is something of a 
problem. Many otherwise excellent 
managers fail to solve it. System 
alone seems not to be entirely suffi
cient. A well-maintained store-house 
system, and a well-placed storehouse 
are the practical mechanisms for deal
ing with the matter. This entails 
adequate clerical aid, which is less of
ten employed than it should be.
I have not touched on the side of 
technical ameliorations. The fact is 
that it is not in this field that the 
manager wTho is a technical 
graduate usually fails. If anything, he 
is too keen to try to ameliorate. He 
feels that by virtue of being collegebred he is called upon to display his 
scientific attainments, and he is prone 
to do so in the most conspicuous place, 
namely, in the metallurgical depart
ment. Improve your extraction by all 
means. Be progressive, follow the 
best new leadership in practice, and 
cautiously blaze aew trails if you can; 
but also apply your higher training as 
a technologist to the improvement of 
your power generation and transmis
sion, to the increased efficiency of 
your compressed-air and electrical 
equipment, and to the multitudinous 
mechanical problems which bristle 
around the mine manager, and which 
you, with your training, should be 
able to solve accurately where the em
pirical workman will make only ap
proximations with his clumsy rule-ofthumb methods.
Upon taking control of a plant, do 
not assume that its system of oper
ation is either all right or all wrong. 
Do not express opinions, but investi
gate. Question every established or
der. Demand its reason for existence,

if there be any. Do not be misled 
into spasmodic actions, or to the mak
ing of snap judgments. Maintain a 
strictly judicial attitude; collect and 
test your evidence, and then decide 
upon the best thing to do. Classify, 
systematize, organize. Your success 
in the long run will depend upon your 
skill in organizing and systematizing. 
Your science will not save the situa
tion if you have not also these quali
ties of industrial generalship. But 
back of these lies the ability to clas
sify, without which you cannot syste
matize; nor organize the human 
agents at your command into an ef
fective mechanism for making your 
system vitally operative. Here you 
should possess an advantage over any 
but the very extraordinary empirical 
competitor.
The management of men is partly 
science and partly art. The science 
of it lies in what has just been ex
plainedthe ability to classify, sys
tematize, organize, and this you can 
learn. The art of it consists in tact.
Set an example of industry, accu
racy, honesty, respectability. Never 
get angry, and never swear. Seek to 
make yourself understood by clear in
cisive speech, not to make yourself 
impressive with bold bad language, 
nor with caustic humor. Be courte 
ous and agreeable, but not too dis
tinctly affable. Do not seek to estab 
lish a reputation lor being charitable 
or kind. Nothing is more certain to 
be misunderstood. Your dependants 
will set it dow'n as weakness of char
acter, and will take advantage of you. 
Instead of this, aim at being just. 
Justice is comprehensible, because it 
is logical. It has the force of that 
necessity which inheres in the rela
tion between an effect and its cause. 
A manager is the representative of 
what we like to call a soulless cor
poration. It is in reality a money
making instrument. It was created 
for that, and for nothing else, and as 
such it must be administered. In 
your personal unofficial relations you 
may give play to your finer feelings, 
but in your managerial capacity, be 
the cool calculating judge, and dis
pense justice.
In conclusion, allow me to advert to 
the managers relations to his employ
ers. As you gain experience you will 
come to feel that nearly all virtues
are necessary in a man to make him 
loyal, and you will prize it as a jewel 
of superior worth. Become that jewel 
for your own company. That is a 
quality which seldom fails of appreci
ation. So identify yourself with the 
companys interests that no division 
can be drawn between the two. Get 
the best results you can, and stand 
or fall with them. Be absolutely 
frank, absolutely truthful, and remem
ber that while good news will keep, 
bad news will not. If you have any
thing disagreeable or unfortunate to 
tell, hit the psychological moment for 
telling it, and that moment is the first 
one in which you can find time for 
writing it. If you postpone, the right 
moment never comes; the delay adds 
to your embarrassment; gives you an
other difficulty to explain; and in the 
end will either warp you into false
hood or put you in the evident position 
of having for a time tried to deceive. 
I repeat, the psychological moment 
for telling the truth, if it be a disa
greeable truth, is the first chance you 
can get. If you doubt this, try it once 
and see!
