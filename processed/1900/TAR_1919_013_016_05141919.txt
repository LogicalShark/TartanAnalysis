ECH OVERSUBSCRIBES ITS 
QUOTA FOR VICTORY BONDS
"Tech quota for the Victory Loan 
as placed at $28,950, but the comittee in charge of the drive volunParily agreed to raise the quota to 
50,000. According to Miss Ethel P. 
turtevant, chairman of the commitand head of the Department of 
icretarial Studies in the Margaret 
orrison Division, Tech has gone 
rer the top with colors flying, and has 
readp passed the $30,000 mark, and 
\pects to treble the voluntary quota 
tfore the drive closes. All the Way 
trough the committee has been at a 
sadvantage because the first bonds 
pught are supposed to be purchased 
the home district of the buyer. Adtional bonds may be bought at 
fech, and it was from the sale of 
ese additional bonds that Tech 
is made such a remarkable showing.

PITT AND TECH AT IT AGAIN IN OAKLAND
On the day of the Fifteenths ar
rival, the crowds of Tech and Pitt 
students got close enough to have a 
scrap, and the inevitable took place. 
The clash started with a free-for-all 
fight, which did not.get very far, how
ever, before a cop came in and sep
arated the opposing sides. Since they 
were mem too far apart to use fists, the 
sticks on which the banners were 
nailed were brought into use. The 
police then came in and spoiled it all 
again by separating the opposing fac
tions to a distance greater than the 
range of the sticks. After that the 
crowds had to satisfy themselves with 
shouting at each other. Then Pitt got 
hold of a bountiful supply of eggs and 
tomatoes, which flew in among the 
Tech students thick and fast for a 
while. Tech could do nothing, because 
the ammunition being used was ex
ceedingly fragile, as was discovered 
by a number who stopped them. Most 
of the casuals,-however, were neutrals 
who seemed insulted that they should 
be fed raw eggs, especially served in 
such a manner. The noble police, how
ever, finally separated the two crowds 
too far for any action. In chasing the 
Pitt students up the hill, however, 
they found it necessary to chuck 
about nine of them in the cooler for 
safe keeping.
TENNIS TOURNAMENT NEARLY COMPLETED
TECH GREETS 15TH ENGINEERS; 
BAND LEADS BIG PEERADE
When the Fifteenth Engineers came 
down Bigelow Boulevard on the morn
ing of May 7 they received a most 
hearty welcome from Carnegie Tech. 
Lined up on both sides of the streets, 
cheering and singing, the students let 
the brave veterans know that they 
were glad to see them. It was a glori
ous sight to see the battle-scarred 
veterans stepping along to I he tune of 
Dear Old Tech. It was groat to see 
the happy smiles on their faces, 
especially when names of Individual 
soldiers were called out.
Bright and early Wednesday morn
ing everybody turned out on the Tech 
campus. All sorts of signs and nolsemaking apparatus was supplied. Ev
erybody had at least one red placard 
on his or her hat, with the words 
Tech Welcomes the Fifteenth. The 
M. M. girls were supplied with dif
ferent colored balloons. Most of the 
boys carried large green placards, 
some with welcomes to individual men 
from Tech, who were In the Engineers, 
others were cheery sayings and wel
comes to the regiment In general.
Led by the Tech Band, the proces
sion went to Bigelow Boulevard and 
lined up along the route of the En
gineers. After a few cheers and sing
ing Dear Old Tech, the words, "Hero 
They Come, were excitedly passed 
down the line, and everybody tried to 
get the best possible vantage point. 
Carnegie was well represented, and so 
there was a continued shouting of the 
names of the various Tech men as 
they passed. Tech Is certainly proud 
of its boys, who helped so nobly in 
winning the great struggle, and re
ceives all its veterans with heartiest 
welcome.
Out of the fifty men who have been 
trying to make the tennis squad, the 
number has dwindled down to 10 or 
15, who are fighting hard to maintain 
their places. Capt. John Beatty has 
cinched liis position and is the best 
bet for the team. The match with 
Allegheny, scheduled for last Wed
nesday, was held up because of the 
rain. The Allegheny team arrived 
Wednesday and Manager Nuttal tried 
every scheme possible to have the 
match played, but more rain Wednes
day afternoon spoiled the courts for 
Thursday as well, so that the match 
has been held off for some future time. 
The team which was chosen to play 
last week consists of Capt. Beatty, E. 
C. Stockslager. Don G. Gawthrop and 
Forest T. Aller.
Manager Nuttal has arranged the 
following schedule for the team:
Miy 3W. & .1. (Postponed).
Mfy 7Allegheny (Postponed).
May 13Pitt at Pitt.
May 1(5Penn State at Tech courts. 
May 17W. & J. at Washington, Pa. 
May 23Grove City at Tech courts. 
May 29Grove City at Grove City. 
June 2Westminster at Tech courts. 
June 7Penn State at Tonn State.
The Penn State games are tentative 
but will probably be decided definitely 
In a day or two. Col, John C. W. 
Brooks, tennis coach, Is working hard 
to/get the team In shapo and also 
hopes to have the twelve new courts 
near Margaret Morrison ready soon.
MUSICAL CLUB SHOW MUCH TALENT AT HOME
Dance Following Concert is Most Suc
cessful Ever Held
[unquestionably the parties who attencflffl the Home Concert 
were more than pleased. Prom the first number until the last, the 
presentation was excellent.
The Glee Clubs interpretation of the Viking's Song and the 
rendering oE this difficult piece, were exceptional, the tirst tenors, 
however, were a little weak.
The second number, Rajah March, b.v the Mandolin Club, was 
splendid, the unity and expression speaking well for the director.
But They Didnt, the third number on the program, was well 
given, the high fast notes seemingly being difficult to execute. How
ever, it was humorous and brought considerable applause.
The fourth number on the program, Lucia din Lnmmermour, by 
the Mandolin Club, was the crowning effort of that club.'
CAPTAIN MCORKLE ENTERTAINS Y. W. C. A.
M. M. D. thought she had had dis
tinguished and interesting speakers 
before, but it took one of our own 
Tech men to show us our mistake. 
The talk which Capt. McCorkle gave 
before the Y. W. C. A., last Thursday, 
had but one faultit was entirely too 
short. Everyone who heard this man 
wanted to hear more, and ar. now 
asking When? We can only repeat 
th'e question, in the hope that Capt. 
McCorkle will hear us and come back.
M. M. D. TO ENTERTAIN PITT AND P. C. W. GIRLS
Thursday, May 15, from 4:30 to 
5:30, the Margaret Morrison Y. W. C. 
A. will be hostess to the Pitt and P. C. 
W. girls. Tea and cake will be served.
Have You a Friend
Whos 21 ? \
Yes, we certainly dislike to em- j barrass you, but,
FOLLOW THE POSTERS!
To those few who deliberately failed 
to turn out and welcome the returning 
soldiers, Tech can only say, 1 pity 
you. If your own heart did not prompt 
you to show your appreciation of the 
heroes in the splendid opportunity of
fered you, you are not an American. 
Grow a beard and go to Russia; do.
THE YANKEE DOUGHBOY
His grandpop fought with Farragut, 
way down in Mobile Bay,
His daddy charged the hill at San 
Juan,
And the kid went out with Pershing, 
when the Johnny Mexs got gay; 
But *now hes over there a fightin 
man.
When the kid said, Folks, Im going, 
his mother stood dry-eyed,
And his daddy got a lump up in his 
throat;
But his mother squeezed him tight, 
and his father glowed with 
pride,
At his soldier son within a khaki 
coat.
So he sailed away to France, with the 
Fightin Sixty-ninth,
And he hopped into the middle oi 
the row;
But he dropped at Belleau Wood, with 
a bullet in his head 
"Somewhere In France hes slecpln 
now.
Now, his mother sits a-dreamln of her 
little soldier lad,
And his father is a-thlnkln of his 
son;
But the kid has joined the Honor Roll 
of Americas glorious dead,
And the little Yankee Doughboy's 
race is run.
Clyde William Carter.
NIG FINDLAY AND OTHER 
VETS WILL PLAY FOOTBALL
Wfrh the return of the FIfteonth 
Engineers the dopesters at Tech are 
figuring the 1920 football team, for the 
greater part of the old team has been 
Inservice, and many of them may 
return to again wear the Tech mole
skins. Captain Findlay Is more than 
a possibility, while l.hero Is more lhan 
a chance that Brunwasser and Mar 
shall will bo back. McFeatera may 
also be in the Tech line-up when the 
whistle blows.
Coach Walter P. Steffens, who was 
understudy for sevoral yoars to Stagg 
of Chicago will return rather late in 
the season, but the actual formation 
of the team will go ahead, just the 
same. With Lwo backs lllce Nig 
Findlay and Phil Marshall to build a 
team around the prospects for a whirl
wind team at Toch are exceedingly 
bright.
So far, a schodulo of eight games 
has been arranged, which will em
brace somo of the best toams In the 
Middle West.
October 4, the ICIltles lino up against 
Bethany College at Tech field Octobor 11 they meet the strong W. & J. 
outfit at Washington, Pa., and on Oc
tober 18 they take on one of the stlffest teams on their calendar, when 
they buck Case at Tech field. The 
Brown and White always turn out a 
first-class team, and this game should 
be a hummer. A week later the 
Tech-Lehigh clash Is scheduled to oc
cur on T(ech field, and on November 1. 
the Plahlles buck the Allegheny Col
lege outfit at the , same place. On 
November 8 Tech meets Cornell at 
Ithaca, N. Y. No date has yet been 
arranged for November 15, but the 
closing game of the season will occur 
on Forbes Field, when Tech and Pitt 
settle tlietr row on the gridiron. In 
view of the happenings of the past few 
days this scrap should be a hummer, 
as both teams are waiting to get a 
wallop at the other crowd.
THE 1919 THISTLE WILL BE 
FINEST YEAR BOOK PRODUCED
A. I. E. E. HOLDS MEETING
Another ilvely meeting of the Car
negie Tech Branch of the A. 1. E. E. 
was held last Wednesday evening in 
Room 11, Machinery Hall. Members 
of the Senior, Junior and Sophomore 
Classes of the Electrical Engineering 
Department were in attendance.
The program for the evening con
sisted of speeches, relating experi
ences in the Government Service. 
Lieut. George McC. Porter, U. S. N. R. 
F., spoke interestingly of Ills presence 
at the surrender of the German fleet 
to the British Grand Fleet. Lieut. 
Spike" Parker, a 1918 Tech gradu
ate, Electrical Engineering, spoke on 
Progress of Aviation During the 
War, coloring his talk with numer
ous experiences gained In this coun
try and in France. "Radio in the 
War" was the subject chosen by Lieut. 
C F. Sheakley, at present a Senior In 
the Electrical Engineering CourHe. 
His long connection with this branch 
of signaling made him particularly 
qualified to present the case or Radio 
Telegraphy In a most able and inter 
estlng manner.Refreshments, consisting of lemon
ade (?) and cake, were served in the 
Mho Club Room.
The Thistle, the year-book of the 
Carnegie Institute of Technology, Is 
aboul ready lo make its appearance 
for 1919. The copy coining out for 
the present year is more than morely 
a chronology of the happenings at 
Tech for the past year, eventful as 
they have been. It is dedicated to I ho 
Tech men who have paid the supremo 
sacrlfico In the gigantic struggle just 
closed, and will bo a loving and grate
ful memorial lo their momory.
This book Is the most representa
tive of any of I lie school publications, 
as the Editorial Staff Is drawn from 
all of the four schools, which go lo 
make up the institution. The full 
staff Is composed of 35 studonts, but 
the executlvo stall' Is composed of l(i 
who are selected purely on their IIInoss for their respective positions. 
Thoy are elected annually for a period 
of ono year.
The editorial staff Is headed by Gil
bert C. Clarke, Editor-in-Ohlof, who 
halls from Washington, I). C. Ho Is 
a graduate of the Kastorn High School 
of I hat city, and Is a student In Com
mercial Engineering at Toch. Whllo 
In high school he was on the publish
ing staff or the high school paper, and 
took a prominent part In military ac
tivities among the Capitol City High 
Schools. He left Tech In April, 1917, 
at the outbreak of the war and enlisted 
In the Naval Itesorvo, where he 
served a year and a half as lihislgn. 
He returned lo school last January.
Tho Associate Edltor*ln*ChIof Is 
Miss Edith I). Mraden, the daughter of 
A. Q, Braden, a well-known attorney 
In Washington, Pa. Miss Braden Is a 
graduate of Washington (Pa.) High 
School, and Is a student in the Secre
tarial Courso at the Margarot Morri
son Division of Cafnoglc Institute of 
Technology. While In high school she 
was an active member In the literary 
society, was elected associate editor 
on tho high school of The Tartan, the 
Tech Weekly. Miss Braden also 
comes from a war-llke family, as her 
mother, sister and herself wero all en
gaged In Red Cross work, and she has 
a brother who is an acting captain 
with the famous Twenty-eighth Divis
ion of Pennsylvanlas, and Is still In 
France.
The Business Manager of The 
Thistle is William D. Oakley, known 
among the students as "Red." His 
home is In Naples, N. Y., * where he 
was president of his graduating class 
In the high school. "Red Is one of 
the most popular men In Tech, where 
he is a student in Building Construc
tion. He is president of the Depart
mental Club; School Representative 
to the Athletic Board of Control and 
to the Student Activities Board; 
member of the School Executive Com
mittee and the Senate Committee; Is 
a member of the Opheleum fraternity; 
is on the staff of The Puppet, a Tech 
magazine, and still finds time to be 
one of the best outfielders on the 
Tech Baseball Team.
Miss Jeannette Shirk, the Art Edi
tor, lives .in Pittsburgh, and is a 
graduate of Peabody High School, 
where, she was a member of the Art 
Staff of the high school monthly 
magazine. She was orte of the first 
three to graduate from the Arts and 
(Continued on Page Four.)
The Interpretation was certainly a 
tribute to the genius of the director 
and the wonderful execution speaks 
well Tor the men In the club. It. was 
unquestionably tho best number by 
this club.
Mr. Weltors solos were good, but 
Ills voice seemed to Indicate that ho 
was a little 111 at ease. Following those 
solos were tho numbers of tho Alum
nae Quartette. It would he Impossible 
to pick any one out of this group and 
say he was tho host. They were all 
good and any exposition ot I heir per
formance would he superfluous, the 
only comment being to congratulate 
them on their spirit In helping out the 
clubs. 'I'hIs spirit on tho part of tho 
alumni Is contributing greatly to tho 
success of Toch activities.
The readings of Mr. Willard were 
certainly enjoyed by ovoryono. Ills 
presence, Ills expression and his fold
ing of perfect easo wero noticeable, 
and, lastly, his ability lo Impersonate 
different characters, portray the rea
son for him winning the Intorscholnstlc Reading Championship <Jf Western 
Pennsylvania last year. Those splen
did readings of Mr. Willard wore fol
lowed by the closing number of tho 
first part of the program, Espanlu, by 
the Mandolin Club.
The second part of tho program was 
opened by the Glee Club with two 
humorous sketches, "Heaven" and 
"Little David." These two selections 
seemed lo he the hit of tho evening, 
as far as the Glee Club was concerned.
"Liberty and Peace Forever," writ
ten by Angolo Vosclal, a member of 
the club, was certainly an excellent 
march and considered by many to be 
the clubs best march.
The "Cavalier's Song," by the Glee 
Club, was a little heavy, and It seems 
too much so Ior a college glee club. 
Following this number came tho man
dolin quartet, composed of Messrs. 
Balaurle, Faville, Ellerton and Swee
ney. Special mention may be made of 
tho excellent performance of Mr. Bal
aurle, Ho Is certainly a finished 
player on tho mandolin. The encore, 
a little "sleeping stunt," was cleverly 
executed, not being too long to bo 
poppy, Sweeney's movements being 
exceptionally clever,
Alexander, tho next number by the 
Glee Club, proved popular. Tho en
core was "I'll Say Sho Does, with Mr. 
Knorr singing, accompanied by the 
Gleo Club. His expression was good 
in connection with the song, some 
comparing him favorably with A1 Jolson, the party he was imitating.
The ensemble on the last number 
was good and would have been better 
had the audience joined in tho chorus, 
the clubs thinking they would do so 
without Invitation.
The performance on the whole was 
first class, It being unexpresalve to 
say that they are the best that Tech 
ever had, everything being character
ized by that hackneyed expression. 
Suffice It to say that Mr. Tarbell said 
they compared favorably with Har
vards clubs.
Comparisons are odious, but If a 
word may be said for either, It. would 
be in favor of the Mandolin Club.
By special request Mr. Scalzo fav
ored the audience by a mandolin solo, 
the only regret being that he didn't 
play more. He was accompanied by 
Mr. E. Horton, the clubs star guitar 
man. "Heavy kept right up with 
Scalzo, even though he was having fun 
doing It, THIS EDITOR.

YEA, VERILYWE LIKE IT?
Several men in Tech who arc at least good prospects for the track 
team Jaugh at the idea of going out for track and going to school to 
five-forty, too, in order to allow the rest of the school to get a course 
in Monkey Movements. It is not that the Tartan is opposed to some 
sort of physical training, but if the Publicity Department is respon
sible for the statement in the papers that the students at Tech are 
in favor of the present; system of P. T. should get round and learn 
the true situation, and not display so much ignorance. The stu
dents have been trying to give it a fair trial, bat any one who thinks 
that they like it has a lot to learn.
A MISUNDERSTANDING
Surely some of I lie young ladies who attended the home concert 
ball felt a little out of place among such an array of evening gowns. 
And many more would not go because the conspicuous presence of 
said gowns at the concert.
The dance was supposed to be informal and it was regrettable 
that; it was not that, way. The question then narrows itself to two 
issues. Either the people who attended it were lo blame or the clubs 
officials for breaking the precedent, of having it totally formal. Th 
club men were disappointed that a Jew parties tried to change to 
formal after their decision.
A mixed dance, is not often a success anywhere. But; the mo
tives of the executive committee wore right, their object being to 
make it possible for the club men lo attend the ball in their evening 
(lollies. It seems however, though, that their plan was not prac
ticable or at least did not work out well and we hope that next year 
the club will follow the timo honored precedent of having a formal 
dance after the concert,, as it is the only all-school formal at Tech.
The spirit of Maytime and the 
beauty and grace of Spring herself 
will be displayed in the songs and 
dances of the Mayday festival. Man 
aged by the Athletic Association an 
supported by the entire school, th 
affair is one of Margaret Morrison 
most representative activities. It will 
be held May 23, on the lawn of Mellon 
Hall. The tickets necessary for ad
mittance arc not on sale, but may be

WELL, PITT?
Almost two years ago there was recruited in Pittsburgh a regi
ment for engineering duty. Both Tech and Pitt gave of her best 
and both institutions were proud of these men and the work that they 
did consistently for the period of their service.
Not only these two institutions, but also the city in which they 
were located was proud of their record. To show some measure of 
this appreciation the city, after a great; deal of trouble, had tlicsc | McKeesport, and will be presented by
THE SPIRIT OF 
THE FATHERS
Members of practically every one of 
t h e hundred Methodist Episcopal 
churches in Allegheny county will pre 
sent the Centenary pageant, The 
Spirit of the Fathers, in Exposition 
Hall, in Duquesne Way, the night, of 
Thursday, May 15, under the auspices 
of the Methodist Episcopal Church 
Union as a preliminary to the Metho
dist Centenary financial campaign, 
which will begin on May IS.
The magnitude of the pageant has 
led to a unique method of rehearsals. 
Mrs. W. S. Bryan of Carnegie, pageant 
director, has divided the churches of 
the county into twelve groups, and to 
each group has been assigned an epi
sode, ^prelude or interlude in the page
ant. Separate rehearsals of these 
church groups have been conducted 
for weeks, under the,direction of Miss 
Anita B. Ferris, author of the pageant.
So systematically have the details 
been worked out that the hundreds of 
young persons who will take part in 
the pageant; will meet in only two com
plete rehearsals before the public jierformance.
The executive committee In charge 
of the pageant is composed of Dr. 
Daniel L. Marsh, Dr. John F. Jose and 
Dr. It. II. McKnlght. Charles N. Boyd 
will be music director and Robert 
Arthur will be orchestra director. The 
chorus pnrts.wlll he sung by the North 
Avenue Methodist Episcopal Church 
choir. The South Hills High Scljool 
Orchestra will furnish the instrument
al music.
Mrs. Harry G. Samson, as The 
Spirit of the Pagan World, will take 
the dominating pari of the spectacle.' 
An initial tableau, depicting. John Wesley declaring I look upon the world 
as my parish, will be led by Miss
nrl Moses of the First Church of

when you ship a suitcase, a handbag 
or other baggage, and you will see 
your best clothes again!
M. M. D. ESTABLISHES VICTORY SCHOLARSHIP
Not content with subscribing its full 
quota of $28,29(-, Tech doubled it. then 
set the new goal of $100,000. And at 
the time of writing $78,000 of this has 
been subscribed.
To say that the Victory Loan Com 
mittee, with Miss Ethel Sturtevant at 
its head, deserves praise is stating the 
matter entirely too mildly. They de 
serve to be publicly congratulated. 
To see the honor flag hanging in the 
M. M. C. S. hall should filL every 
Techite with pride. But he -should re
member that that flag represents per
sonal sacrifice on the part of the members of the committee and those girls 
of -the M. M. D. Secretarial Depart
ment. And if that, doesn't make -him 
prouder than ever of his Tech, we 
dont know what ever, could!
In addition to1 this, at a rousing 
student assembly last Friday at M. 
M. D., plans were announced for the 
establishment of a scholarship, to be 
known as the Victory Scholarship, at 
Margaret Morrison. The Alumnae of 
the school have pledged $100; the 
faculty $400,. while the remaining $500 
is to come from the student "body. It 
has been decided to elect, a committee 
from each class to, decide how the 
classes are to raise their apportion
ments. The money will be invested 
in bonds.
The scholarship, to be awarded to a 
deserving member of the Junior Class, 
will consist of tuition, with the addi
tional sum of $50.
Call for Photographs
A Book of Views illustrating the 
work of the Institute, as well as the 
student activities, is being prepared. 
Any students who have photographs 
of unusual interest are requested to 
submit them to the Secretary. It is 
desired that the material for the new 
book be in hand as early as possible.
Thomas S. Baker
Secretary.
DORM DANCE FULL OF JAZZ ANO NOVELTIES
The annual dance given'by the boys 
dormitories, was held last Friday 
evening a -week ago in the Union. 
About, seventy-five couples availed 
themselves of the opportunity to enjoy 
i very pleasant evening.
One side of the Union was taste
fully arranged with cozy chairs and 
comfy. sofas. Charming lattice-work 
separated this corner from the dance 
floor, A novel innovation was intro
duced during the moonlight. Instead 
of the usual moon, an electric arc was 
made and then broken. This novelty 
proved to he something out of the or
dinary and created much comment.
The program of twenty dances was 
completed by 1 o'clock. The music 
was furnished by Schmertzs five-piece 
orchestra.
The committee in charge consisted 
Mr. Duval, chairman; Messrs. 
Kritcher, McCurdy, Gare, Doerzbach
IF you want the best pipe 
that can be made, you 
can get it in a W D Cup 
to $6. f you want the best 
genuine French Briar that 
as little as 75 cents will buy, 
you can get it inaWDC.

men sent here before they were discharged. No expense nor trouble 
was spared to make this a gala day and one which the engineers 
would always remember.
Did the soldiers remember this as we wanted them to? Wasnt 
the sight of flying eggs and other missies of a vegetarian nature 
rather tame after what they had seen over sea?
Then, too, what did some of the visitors think when they were 
assaulted in an unforeseen manner?
The above happening give constant food for thought. This city 
has two educational institutions, any one of which would make an
other city proud and yet thinking seriously of what happened when 
the Fifteenth Engineers came home, it was rather discourteous.
Last year the two institutions had many a laugh over boy 
scout and mail carrier.
They have always been athletic rivals but this school will never 
be a rival for first place in the Oakland police station. Furthermore, 
they are not alibi Ikes with their No. S4. They are men and
they stand or fall on what they do.
Let us hope that the next time the two institutions meet, the
Pifties will be willing hosts, and that, the T.echites, having forgotten
tho memory of a certain captainwho is, by the way, about as popu
lar at Tech as a snake at a lawn partywill act the same way.

IS THIS YOUR TRUNK?
About a thousand pieces of per
sonal baggage go astray, each month, 
according to a recent statement bv 
an express official. Very probably,1 the 
trunks and suitcases of college stu
dents are among them, particularly at 
this season. Therefore, it is import
ant that you start your trunk right, 
safeguarded with the proper kind of 
address labels and tags.
Most, of the trouble is due to the 
fact, that trunks, unlike the students, 
cannot speak for themselves, when 
the address label or tag comes off. 
Old marks from previous trips are 
confusing to the expressmen, and usu
ally send the baggage some place 
where it oughtn't to go.
11 you do not want your vacation 
ruined, or a romance shattered by a 
lost trunk, follow these general rules:
Remove or cancel all addresses of 
former trips.
Dont entrust your fineries to a 
single tag. The expressmen will not 
accept your baggago unless you have 
a label on it, in addition to a strong 
tag.
He sure it IS a strong tag. One with 
a reinforced eyelet, and attached with 
a heavy cord or wire, is best.
Use good ink, never lead pencil, in 
writing the address, and do it legibly, 
giving all of these details: Name of
shipper; where from; name of con
signee; local address, street and numFrlday, May .23, is to be an eventful j  
day on the campus. To complete the 
day. well begun by the M. M. May Fes
tival. the second and probably the last 
tennis dance is to be held in the 
evening in the Union.
The first tennis dance, held May 3, 
was a complete success, but the next 
one promises to be even better. Many 
of those who were at the first tennis 
dance have already spoken to the ten
nis management for tickets.
The orchestra has not yet been an
nounced, but music as fine as that en
joyed at the last dance is assured.
Next weeks Tartan will contain 
further particulars.
SCODO!NOTES
There is no joy equal to the joy of 
greeting the returned soldiers.
There were lots of nominations and 
elections at Margaret Morrison last 
week. At the time of writing we do 
not know who the candidates were, 
bin next weeks Tartan will tell you 
that they were the right ones. And 
speaking of right ones, there seems 
to be a rumor that Harriet Stone may 
get some position.
The May meeting of Hie Student 
Branch of the A. 1. E. E. was held on 
May 7. Mr. G. M. Porter spoke on his 
experiences in the North Sea with the 
Navy. The talk was exceptionally in
teresting on account of the first hand 
information which it gave in regard 
to iho surrender of the German lleet.
Mr. H. L. Parker, formerly an 
officer in the air service, gave a very 
interesting talk on the subjects which 
were not urimarily technical in char
acter. The meeting was planned as a 
lion-technical one.
Mr. C. F. Slieakloy, who was com
missioned in the Signal Corps, spoke 
on the use of wireless in the war.

TllO HOCl'Ot Of HUCCOHHfUl athletic 
lonni.H In colleger Is to liavo mon 
out for the various toaniH. No man 
onn make a football team out of ii 
mon nor can a baseball coach make 
a team of nine.
How often do we hoar some young 
fellow Hay "1 would go out but ] 
couldnt make the team!
II I' tills attitude of the under
graduate that Is now hampering the 
progress of Tech athletics. If you 
can't make a team, ' come out any 
way, you can help.
In the hope that some one not 
Interested in athletics, may better ap. 
predate the position and possibilities 
therein, the following summary will 
be given here. Become acquainted 
with Tech Athletics. Do even better 
and'get into them.
Professor Wagner is facing a seri
ous problem in producing a team 
here for the available candidates are 
limited in number. When Uncle 
Sam called, the first men in Carnegie 
to respond to the call were the ath
letes and as a great number of these 
men are still in service the available 
supply is rather limited.
Associated with Professor Wagner 
are Dr. William L. Marks, Athletic 
Director of the Institute, Captain 
William J. Hazel, Track Coach, Wal
ter P. Steffens, Football Coach and 
William M. Munhall, better known as 
Bert, who is supervisor of Athletic 
Equipment and keeps the candidates 
in physical condition.
' Dr. Marks, who 1ms been with the 
Institute for a number of years was 
a well-known athlete in the Univer
sity of Pennsylvania and made a 
name for himself in all forms of ath
letics. He was1 one of the best ends 
(hat ever played on a Red and Blue 
eleven and a crack basket hall player. 
In addition to being Supervisor of 
Athletics, ho Is the resident physician 
of the Institute.

from Fosdtck Commission on train 
ing camp activities'. He has been 
stationed at Camp Humphries where 
he was athletic director of the En
gineers division. He has been teach
ing army calisthenics to 25.000 men.

team, shortstop on the baseball team

and slipped off the 100 and 220 dash
es with the track team. Following 
this he was assistant coach with C. 
Fofiter Sanford, the old Yale sLar. 
Captain Hazel is- ii^, harge of the 
track team and is facing the same 
shortage that Wagner Is experiencing. 
He is, however, a very versatile ath
lete, being a trained boxer and 
wrestler as well as general athletics 
and it will be no surprise if he turns 
out a crack team for Carnegie.
Walter. P. Steffens, who is coach 
of the football team, has had prob
ably the soundest training of any 
man in the Eastern States. He is 
known as one of the brainiest, most 
resourceful quarterbacks who ever 
donned the moleskins at the Univer
sity of Chicago.  Two years in suc
cession while on the U. of C. team 
he. won a place on the All-American 
team. Following his graduation, for 
four years he coached the Chicago 
team under Head Coach Stagg. For 
the past five years he has been at 
Carnegie and it is expected will again 
turn out the same snappy aggregation 
of line, smashers and end skirters 
Carnegie has always had under his 
coaching. Spring training will soon 
begin.
One of the most valuable adjuncts 
in Carnegies athletic faculty is 
"Bert Munhall, who is in charge of 
the equipment and well being of the 
athletes. Munhall gained his expe
rience as a member of the old Sterl
ing Steel Works football team and 
later was a member of the Sterlings 
of Wilkinsburg when they won the 
championship of Ohio. Pennsylvania 
and West Virginia in 1909-1910. Mun
hall has a vast store of lcnoledge 
of all things athletic and sees to it 
that no athletic representing Carnegie 
goes into any sort of a contest un
less he is in perfect condition physic
ally and equipped with the proper 
accouterments. His quick eye in
stantly detects any irregularity in the 
playing of a candidate and his sidllful lingers know the tricks of taking 
out cricks and "Charley horses.
Among the available track team 
material, Captain C. B. Schmidt Is 
reeling off the quarter and half mile 
in record time. Although only twen
ty years old, he has-done-the, quar
ter In .52 flat and is looked for to 
cut the two minute mark on the half. 
M. S. Care, of Northampton, Mass., 
Is another youngster who is shaping 
up on the quarter and although a 
new man, gives promises of plenty 
of speed. Hiller of Attica High 
School, Attica, N. Y., is doing pretty 
work on the quarter and will also 
be an entry on the 100 yard daili. 
On the hurdles It. C. Petry of 
Urlchsville, Ohio, Is skipping the low 
hurides neatly and R. W. Arnold of 
Norwich,. Connecticut, is taking both 
high and low In good shape.

Among the candidates for distance 
runners J. R. Miller of Westinghouse 
High School, Pittsburgh, and R. A. 
Swift of Avalon, Pa., both give prom
ise of upholding Carnegie on the 
long run.
George Ellerton, Jr., of Sewickley, 
Pa., is the most promising of the 
candidates for the shot-put. Although 
only a youngster and a little fellow 
in the bargain, he heaved the 16- 
pound shot 40 feet and six inches 
and threw the lighter 12-pound shot 
45 feet 7 inches. A small but choice 
selection of candidates for jumpers 
are turning out every day. F. L. 
O'Brien of Hartford, Connecticut, is 
sure to land a place among the wide 
jumpers. E. Y. Davidson of Wash
ington, D. C., clears the broad, R. L. 
Hamman of Wheeling, W. Va., does 
the high and the pole, while M. L. 
Smith, a versatile young' chap from 
Olean, N. Y., does the high and 
broad and is a clever fellow with 
the pole as well.
Although the war has sadly deplet
ed the ranks of the baseball squad 
nobody has yet cinched a place on 
the team, for in the small squad Pro
fessor Wagner has instilled so much 
"pep that lively scraps are on for 
practically every position on the 
team. The entire team will no doubt 
depend largely 'on the work of Cap
tain E. M. Gretzler Who is probably 
the strongest man on the mound. Al
though early in the season Captain 
Gretzler seems to have plenty of 
steam and hopes in this, his graduat
ing year to lead his team to victory.
Elliott Is Also Doing Well.
E.- Godden of Fredonia, N. Y., is 
the most likely of the backstop aspirants, but L. Levin of Paterson, N. 
J., is. chasing him closely. Ray 
Dougherty of Pittsburgh, formerly of 
the Oakland Rebels, seems to have 
made a place for himself at the ini
tial bag, but R. L. Good of Pitts
burgh, M. L. Gibson of West Newton, 
Pa., and D. Riley of Paterson, N. J., 
are making a three-cornered fight for 
the custodianship of the second sack. 
M. L. Lynn has apparently nailed 
down his job at short but there is 
another contest at third between 
Fred Maurer of Lebanon, Pa and P. 
Huffman of Norwalk, O.
To cap the sheaf, M. Curtis of 
Buffalo, can he put into any of the 
in field positions at; a moments notice 
The outfield contest lies between P. 
Hoban of Naples, N. Y., B. Oakley 
from the same town, M. Gates, B. 
Abrahams, and M. McCaue, all of 
Pittsburgh. Elmer Weiss of Orville!
