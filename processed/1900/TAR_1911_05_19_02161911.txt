By Three Brilliant nictoriesWestinghouse, Pitt and Geneva Teams Defeated.
Carnegie Tech opened the home season in basket 
ball on Tuesday evening, February 7, at the Field 
House with a well-deserved victory over the fast 
Westinghouse Club. The attendance was large, a 
number of women being scattered among the root
ers who responded to the call of All together. 
The game was fast and was marked by the improved 
guarding and team work of the Tech players. The 
first half ended with only four points to the credit of 
the Westinghouse men, and those scored on fouls. 
In the second half substitutes were used on the Car
negie team and the visitors were able to run up a 
respectable score. All of the Tech men deserve 
credit for their playing; DuBarry and Jordan are 
worthy of special mention for aggressive and heady 
basket ball. Walsh starred for Westinghouse, and 
but for the close guarding he received would have 
run the score up materially. The score:

Pitt 'narsity yalls Before Tech.
In the second game of the series, Tech Varsity 
showed Pitt basket ball as she ought to be played. 
Our neighbors from the hill, on Friday, February 
10, formed the party of the second part in the first 
college contest in the Field HouseTheir intentions 
were to make it two straight, and were evidently 
bona fide, but the chief factor had been omitted 
from their reckoning. That was the Tech team.
The crowd was so large as to tax the seating ca
pacity of the hall, and some of the smaller boys 
sought vantage points on the gymnasium appara
tus. A large portion of the spectators were women 
and the bunch of beauty at the lower end of the hall 
was undoubtedly one reason why the play was 
around the Tech basket in the first period.
The game itself was fast and furious, and the in
tense rivalry between the schools found expression 
in the manner in which the ball was kept in motion. 
Our light men set a pace which the heavier Pitt 
team could follow with difficulty. The team work 
on both sides was excellent and drew applause from 
the crowd repeatedly.
The playing of the defenders of the Plaid was 
superior to that of the Gold and Blue in all depart
ments, except that of foul shooting. As in the 
former game, Farmer showing an ability to drop 
the ball into the basket in a way that drew admira
tion from all. Out of 21 free chances he caged the 
ball i4 times. He also showed more speed than any

of the other members of his team in the first half, 
securing the only field goal in that period. Mc
Dowell at center also played well during the entire 
game and in the second half got a goal to his credit. 
Bane, who was substituted for Weger in the second 
period, when the latter was sent from the floor, 
showed considerable ability in his floor work and a 
long shot which netted Pitt a third field goal.
The game was rough throughout, and each team 
drew penalties for tripping and pushing, with Tech 
slightly on the cleaner side, but in the second half 
the trouble broke. This was when DuBarry and 
Weger came together on the side lines. In jumping 
for the ball our guards elbow made a contact with 
the Pitt captains nose. On the next attempt it was 
Wegers fist that landed and Referee Dr. Flint 
called it a draw and ordered both men from the 
game. Mandeville was substituted for DuBarry and 
made good, while Bane went in for Weger with a 
good temper and lots of wind.
Williams and Keltz showed the best work of the 
evening, each securing three field goals. Captain 
Jimmy was everywhere when needed and Keltz 
could not be kept from the ball. Saunders and Du
Barry covered- their men well and outshone their op
ponents. But it was the accurate, fast passing and 
excellent team work that won the game for Tech. 
It is safe to predict that the Varsity has struck its 
gait and opponents will have to travel some to win 
from us.
Dr. Flints work as referee needs no comment, as 
his ability is well known. The line-up:

shots kept the spectators interested.
Soon after the whistle sounded, Keltz made the 
first point on a foul. A foul called on Tech was 
missed by Dodds, and was followed by a double 
foul, which both sides missed. Jordan shortly 
scored the first field goal of the evening on a short 
shot, and was able to add two more in the first half. 
Just before the end of this period, Martsoff, the 
Geneva guard, made a long one-handed shot over 
his head into the basket, scoring Genevas only 
field goal in this half. Score Tech 18Geneva 3.
i he scoring in the second half opened with a long 
shot by DuBarry into the basket. Methany starred 
for Geneva in this half by getting a lucky goal over 
his shoulder and adding two more before the whis
tle ended the game. Keltz also made good on a 
spectacular shot. The passing of the plaid tossers 
was a feature of the game, and Keltz was the indi
vidual star with five field goals and eight fouls out 
of twelve chances to his credit. The line-up:

iplendid xvening of yellowship and xntertainment 
xnjoyed by drchitectural itudents.
A sweet cigar and a soothing stein,
A song and a jest and a friend of mine,
With a toast and a pledge to Applied Design 
Ah, heres to the Eve of Saint Valentine!
With rare good feeling and spirits mellow the Ap
plied Design men, together with their guests, num
bering almost a hundred, gathered in festive com
pany at the Fort Pitt on the Eve of St. Valentine, 
Feb. 13th. The occasion was the big Design Smoker. 
Man of leisure and hard-workink student, sat side 
by side, elbowing each other in joyous comradery; 
upper classmen and the lowly Plebe toasted each 
other in an effervescence of happy companionship; 
brawny athlete and brainy esthete bumped steins 
in laughter and jestgood-fellowship ruled supreme.
After an hour and a half of frolic and fun, during 
which the sweet periume of the odorous cigar 
mixed with the fragrant incense of a half-hundred 
gloom-dispelling sticks of Turkish leaf, Toastmas
ter E. W. Boyer arose and in a clever manipulation 
language introduced the first speaker of the 
evening.
Mr. Donald M. Scott, manager of the 1910 foot ball 
team, responded to the call. With much earnestness 
and splendid address, Mr. Scott pleaded the cause 
of athletics and its vital influence upon the charac
ter and reputation of a college. He applauded the 
interest and good-spirit shown by the men of the 
School of Applied Design, and closed with a straightto-the-heart appeal for a widened scope and in
creased field for the athletic advancement of the 
Schools.
After a few minutes of general conversation, Mr. 
Boyer introduced Sg. Scalzo, Director of the Man
dolin Club. Sg. Scalzo held his audience spell-bound 
for the next fifteen minutes by his perfect control 
and absolute mastery of the mandolin. His rendi
tion was splendid and he was compelled to give a 
generous encore before he was allowed to rest.
Following the music, Tex Griffith responded in 
behalf of the Plebe Class. His talk, though brief, 
was surcharged with good-feeling and friendliness. 
He was well-received by the assembly.
With enthusiastic reception, the Lyric Quartet 
then got in some excellent work. R. R. Rose, R. M. 
Crawford, Roy Hodgon and Ed. Hodgon, were the 
artistes and melody flowed like the clear tinkling
waters of a mountain brooklet, now soft and mur
muring, now fast and furious, never for a moment 
losing its rhythm and poetry of sound.
After the songsters had been permitted to take 
their seats once more. Toastmaster Boyer intro
duced James K. Lamoree, editor of the Tartan. Mr. 
Lamoree spoke in behalf of Techs weekly and 
showed the tremendous influence which is exerted by 
the college press. He also offered felicitations in 
behalf of the School of Applied Science.
Victor Rigaumont, the last speaker on the pro
gram, then addressed the men. From a position of 
vantage, with jest and anecdote, he presented a 
toast to his fellows and his comrades. Rah tor 
Riggy filled the hall in response.
It was much regretted that Dean McGoodwin, 
who was one of the honor-guests, was obliged to 
withdraw early in the evening on account of a tem
porary indisposition. The solicitations and goodwishes of the assembled men were his.
Throughout the evening cheers were led by Rigau
mont, the volatile little Frenchman, leading with 
picturesque abandon. Bob Crawford also pleased 
the multitude by several solos early in the evening, 
his melodious selection winning for him both ap
plause and favor.
It was 12 oclock when the last cigar-butt was 
flicked away and the lights were dimmed for the 
night. In pairs and groups the happy revellers 
wended their ways to their various domiciles, each 
one declaring in emphatic and decided terms the 
pleasures of the evening spent.

The Junior Promenade Committee met last week 
end at the home of the chairman and completed the 
arrangements for the Prom. W. F. Burkhart, Jr., 
President of the Applied Design School, will lead

The Glee and Mandolin Clubs covered themselves 
with glory at the recent concert given before the 
University Club of this city. The Musical Clubs 
appeared as especial guests of the big ex-college or
ganization and the men were treated to the best 
of everything by the members of the Club.
The Clubs gathered in the Billiard Room of the 
University Clubs home at 8.30 and started in to do 
things in the line of music which brought encore 
after encore. Selections by the Glee Quartet and 
the Mandolin Trio were especially fine and received 
considerable applause. Cigars and other accessories 
were to be had in abundance and no man was al
lowed to stop a moments pleasure on account of 
shortage of supplies.
About 10.30 the Harvard men, who had separated 
themselves from the rest, wanted music and their 
wishes were quickly satisfied. The Cambridge dele
gation started things with a Harvard cheer, ending 
with three Techs, and were quickly answered by 
the Carnegie men by a Locomotive and three 
Harvards. After another round of music and ci
gars it was announced that the feed was ready for 
the Clubs in the large banquet hall. An elaborate 
supper was in waiting. Hot oyster patties in abun
dance with salads, sandwiches, coffee, etc., were 
placed before the hungry men. More cigars were 
passed around and everyone got in on the songs 
that followed. Some Italian songs by Sg. Scalzo,

good. Speeches were next on the program and 
were made by the Club directors and officers. While 
all of the remarks were good, some by Mr. MacDowell, Director of the Glee Club, were of especial 
interest. They not only showed his interest in the 
Club, but contained valuable hints as to the proper 
method of bettering the organization. Sg. Scalzo, 
Director of the Mandolin Club, although handicap
ped in his lack of fluent English, drove home the 
fact that the Mandolin Club was using better music 
and playing it in better style than clubs in most of 
the other colleges.
After other speeches by the officers of the clubs, 
another song was sung to the remaining University 
men and the party dispersed.

H. King, Jr., chairman of the auditing committee, 
reported that the treasurers books had been care
fully gone over by his committee and had been 
found to be correct. The treasurers report which is 
published in full in this issue of the Tartan, includes 
a detailed account of all money expended for ath
letics during the past year. According to motion, 
the report of the auditing committee was accepted 
by vote of the Board. Motion approving Treasurer 
Cogswells report was then made and carried.
The business of electing a man to fill the office of 
base ball manager left vacant by C. C. Hixenbaughs 
resignation, was then taken up, as was also the elec
tion of first assistant taseball and track managers, 
both of these positions being open. Spirited ballot
ing resulted as follows:
Base ball manager, W. W. Powell; First Assistant 
Base Ball Manager, T. D. Fitzgibbon; First Assist
ant Track Manager, H. C. Franks.
A motion was then offered and carried stating* 
that a letter of thanks and appreciation be sent by 
the Board to Mr. Hixenbaugh for the work he had 
done in preparing the 1911 base ball schedule.
After a general discussion of different phases of 
the athletic situation in general, the meeting was 
adjourned.

W. N. Frew, Esq.,
President of Board of Trustees,
Carnegie Institute, Pittsburg:
Dear Sir:
- i should like to hav the views of the trustees as 
to what features of the Institute could be wisely 
still further developt; which is suffering most for 
lack of more means at the disposal of the directors. 
I had better put it in this form to you all. If the 
Institute had fifty or a hundred thousand dollars 
yearly more income, what would it do with it, and 
in what amounts w'ould it be distributed and for 
what reasons?
Is there any new uepartment that would add to 
its usefulness? I shall be very glad to hav the 
views of yourself and the trustees on this matter. 
Very truly yours,

Barnard girls are clamoring to gain recognition 
and representation on the Columbia Spectator. 
Ex.
The above item clipped from one of our college 
exchanges may easily be passed over without ex
citing any comment. However, a little thought and 
consideration will bring out several things which 
are of important bearing upon Carnegie Tech and 
the Tartan in general and the Margaret Morrison 
Carnegie School in particular.
In a great many, and in fact, in most, of the col
leges and universities in the country, the feminine 
element which of modern times has invaded the 
field of education with a firm demand for equality 
and recognition receives but very little considera
tion at the hands of the average male undergrad
uate. This may or may not be unfortunate. Hap
pily such is not the case in our own institution.
The M. M. C. S. with its host of fair students 
has always stood as the best and most beloved of 
our possessions. The very fact that over fifty per 
cent, of all the girls who attend Tech dances and 
Tech games are Margaret Morrison girls attests 
the regard of the Carnegie men.
Have the Margaret Morrison girls done their 
part? In the case of the Tartan they have not!
The Tartan is published weekly in the interest 
of the Carnegie Technical Schools. A special col
umn and space to the amount of one page has been 
placed at the disposal of the girls. Two of their
members occupy permanent positions on the Tartan 
Board and have done good work during the year. 
But the girls as a body have never supported their 
school paper as they should. They have not grasped 
the opportunities within their reach.
There is not much more to say. It is certainly 
too bad that our girls are casting aside with contempt 
that privilege for which the girls of Barnard and of 
other affiliated womens schools are fighting for so 
determindly.
Perhaps few of the girls have considered repre
sentation in the Tartan as a necessary and import
ant privilege. When we consider that nearly fifty 
colleges and universities in this country exchange 
with the Tartan weekly, and that by the Tartan are 
we judged, then possibly we will realize the re
sponsibility placed in our care and discharge it as 
such.

Mr. Greth, who is a specialist on water purificatior gave a very interesting talk throughout.
He took up the chemical features and then wound 
up with the mechanical features of water purifica

After the lecture, questions were asked what 
brought up new points for discussion. A number

questions that were of interest to those present. 
Refreshments were served as usual by the purvey

This issue of the Tartan marks a step in advance. 
During the past five months, the Board of Editors of 
Carnegie Techs weekly paper have worked long and 
devotedly to give the Schools a comprehensive, re
presentative chronicle of the happenings and events 
which take place daily, yes hourly, within and about 
the precincts of a live, breathing technical college. 
That we have fully and perfectly accomplished this 
end, we do not believe. However, the business and 
work connected with the construction and publica
tion of the Tartan has been systematized and simpli
fied to that extent that we feel sure that the paper 
will attain within the next few months an efficiency 
and worth never before equalled in the Carnegie 
Technical Schools. But we cannot do it without 
your helpwhich brings us down to the heart of our 
talk.
The college journal, whether it be daily, weekly or 
even monthly, holds a position in the life of a school, 
the importance of which is seldom appreciated by 
the unthoughtful. There is small doubt but that 
some of the most desirable improvements in college
existence have been brought about directly or in
directly by the college paper. There is no doubt 
but that the college paper exerts tremendous influ
ence, generally silent but always effective, upon the 
general attitude and general conduct of the college 
student. In fact, the college paper has always stood 
as the best and most complete organ of representa
tion within thegrasp of the undergraduate! Do you 
ever stop to realize just how much the success of a 
student representative depends upon the students 
represented? Do you ever for a moment consider 
just how much the success of the Tartan rests upon 
Your shoulders?
We repeat, in no spirit of boast, that the Tartan 
is improving. This is in a degree the natural re
sult of the great strides of progress which have been 
made during the past year by the Schools themselves. 
A progressive policy, ambitious graduates, careful ad
ministration and increased power derived from in
creased financial resources and a more thoroughly 
organized system of instruction, all these have added 
to the character and reputation of this institution, 
bringing it into the front ranks of schools of its kind 
in the country. With the complete fulfillment of the 
plans and movements on foot at the present time, a 
fulfillment wrhich lies in the very near, future, Car
negie Tech will stand without a peer as an institu
tion of universal technical training. It is up to the 
Tartan, official organ of all the Schools, to keep pace 
with this advancement. It is our intention to do so 
but we cant do it without your interest, your help, 
your support!
You perhaps wonder why we have gone to the un
usual expense of making this issue free to every stu
dent in the Schools. You perhaps have often won
dered why we have gone to the expense of procur
ing new covers from time to time or why we have so 
often given you a sixteen-page paper when a twelvepage paper would do. Let us tell you.
The Tartan during its short and varied existence 
has time and time again proven its worth and effec
tiveness in behalf of the men it represents. The 
Tartan has already shown itself to a great portion 
of Tech men to be an indispensible student organiza
tion. We want to show you that we are indispensible 
to xnxrY man in Tech!
The Tartan has adopted a policy of systematic 
progress. Complete accounts of events and happen
ings in Tech will be handed to its readers weekly 
as hithertofore. Four new covers will be used dur
ing the rest of the school year as an added detail of 
interest. The different departments and columns 
of the paper will be enlarged and improved. Es
pecial diligence will be used in exploiting athletic

Business Manager H. J. McCorkle has completed 
arrangements whereby he will be enabled to furnish 
subscriptions to the Tartan at 50c for the remainder 
of the school year. Seventeen issues will be pub

makes the paper less than 3c per copy. This offer 
will be open for two weeks only. Tartan representa

subscriptions and we hope to double our list of sub
scribers before we are through. Will you help us?

paper much thought. Perhaps you have never given 
the Tartan a fair investigation. Perhaps you have

We deeply regret to report the resignation of Mr. 
J. H. Clements, athletic editor of the Tartan. Mr. 
Clements has done excellent work in his official ca
pacity and will be missed by those who are inter
ested in sports.
It gives us pleasure to announce the election of 
M. C. B. Kline to the position of athletic editor, left 
vacant by Mr. Clements resignation. Mr. Kline has 
been associated with the Tartan in the capacity 
of assistant editor in the past and will have no
trouble in discharging his new duties thoroughly 
and efficiently.
self. Far from it. The present incumbent of the 
office is probably as capable a man as could be 
found. However, the matter of precedent enters.
Important offices within the power of the students 
to confer should be given with three points in view:
First, the man should be one who has been in 
school long enough to win the confidence of his 
fellows, not through personal regard, but through 
merit won from past service well rendered; second
ly, the man should have been in school long enough 
to know the conditions under wrhich we are work
ing; thirdly, the office should be of sufficient worth 
and honor as to be looked forwarded to and respect
ed. None of these ends can be fully accomplished 
when the man holding the office is so comparatively 
new in.the schools.
The manager of a varsity team should be a Sen
ior. At the very least he should be a Junior. In
stalling underclassman is bad policy. We wish to 
extend our congratulations to Mr. Powell. We hope 
that he will have a successful season. We sincere
ly hope that he will make good in the responsible 
position he holds. We compliment him on the en
ergy he has shown in capturing his office. Energy 
is the first sign of a good manager.
At the same time we cannot but be inclined to 
think that the Board of Control has been guilty 
of extreme carelessness and disregard for the best 
interests of the schools in not conferring their 
honors upon men who have won them either by pre
vious managerial apprenticeship or by previous 
good work done in the interests of the Schools and 
iis different departments.

12THE TARTAN
THE DEANS COLUMN
February 13th, 1911.
Dear Mr. Editor: 
What a torrent of suggestions and advice you have 
loosed upon your patient readers in the Deans 
Column! Recognizing that there are limits to endur
ance even of students, I had thought of writing this 
week upon something remote from the Schoolsthe 
formation of a local lodge of Dickens Association for 
the Distribution of Blankets and Top Boots to the In
habitants of Bouleo boolegar, for example; but alas 
I find that I am like the good old family doctor whose 
medicine case contains only calomel, calomel and 
again calomel.
The college graduate of twenty-five years ago, who 
visits the Schools, invariably exclaims Wonderful! 
we had nothing like this when I was a student. And 
his statement is literally true. The advances in 
science, the laboratory methods now employed, the 
broadening of the field of higher education to include 
engineering, architecture and many other callings 
formerly acquired in the shops and drawing rooms 
have resulted in an astonishing multiplication of 
buildings and equipment. Today the universities and 
technical schools are powerful corporations holding 
rights in property worth about six hundred millions 
of dollars and expending annually close to one hun
dred millions of dollars. The yearly receipts and ex
penditures of some of the States of the Union fall 
far below those of some of our large universities.
Impressive as these figures are they take on an 
even greater significance when it is considered that 
notwithstanding the immense increase in the en
rollment of our colleges it is still true that in a given 
year only three persons in every thousand of our 
entire population make use of these great educational 
plants, that even of the students who actually enter 
our High Schools only one in twenty-five completes 
a course in a college or technical school. Today as 
formerly, the college man is, therefore, in point of 
training at least, the captain of a companywith 
the possibility, not of being, but of becoming a true 
leader if only he has the divine spark in him.
Not only is there open to him the opportunity of 
service in leadership but a direct obligation is laid 
upon him to make some return for the special privi
leges which have been given him. The gain of per
sonal power is a legitimate and proper objective in 
a college course, but that power must not be em
ployed for mere personal gain. The betterment of
the individual does, of course, raise the average of 
the community and so results in general good, but 
this was not the controlling motive in the founding 
of educational institutions. A study of the mottoes 
of our colleges will make clear that in the minds of 
the founders the idea of training for service in leader
ship was uppermost. Harvards For Christ and the 
Church and Yales For Public Employment in the 
Church and in the Civil State are typical of the older 
universities. Even with the broadening out of the 
system of education to include more commercial call
ings than the old professions, the obligation of serv
ice retains its prominence. The beautiful inscription 
on the Court of our own School for Women is a con
spicuous example. Speaking for the School of Ap
plied Science I have often wished that we had as 
happy and inspiring an expression of the highest 
prerogative of the engineer constantly before our 
eyes.
I shall not attempt to do more than to indicate 
some of the fields of service in leadership open 
today to the products of our colleges. First must 
come, of course, efficient, honest and enthusiastic 
service in the calling for which he has been specially 
trained. But beyond that the contribution of the 
college man to the formation of intelligent and just 
public opinion, his identification with movements and 
associations that tend to relieve suffering and to 
better conditions of living, his active participation in 
the duties and honors of citizenship, these and many 
more opportunities are open to him. The only quali
fications necessary are an altruistic purpose and a de
sire for service.
There has never been a period in the history of our 
country when there was such need as now for men 
of altruistic motivemen who are willing to sacrifice 
their personal gain to the public good. In business, 
in the church, in civic organizations, in politics, there 
is a great unrest which is only waiting capable and 
disinterested leadership to accomplish much needed 
reforms. That leadership will not be conferred upon 
the graduate with his diplomahe will find the way 
the rough road of service; but he enters the field 
with special qualifications and under special obliga
tions. The school that sends out its men well trained 
in their special fields but above all with the com
pelling motive of service will most nearly realize 
the reason for its existence.

If one decides upon the most advantageous temprature of the gases as they pass out of the shaft 
one may, by experience, decide upon the height of 
furnace which is of greatest advantage. The fol
lowing is a description of an experiment made to de
termine this temperature, especially with reference 
to the blast furnace of Swedish construction, which 
will be used (as a rule) at the Norwegian ore fur
naces.
It is a fact that an electric reduction furnace 
needs only one-third of the amount of coke which 
is necessary for the common blast furnace per ton 
of ore, as the heat for melting is generated electric
ally, and the coke is used only to reduce the ore.
The main part of the reduction takes place in 
the melting zone, where the molten ore is reduced 
directly by the glowing coke. Higher up where the 
ore is not fused ii. may only be reduced by carbon 
monoxid. This is formed not alone by the first 
process of reduction, but also by the blast which in 
this case only contains CO and C02, with only small 
quantities of other gases passing over the glowing 
coke. It is one of the main features of the Swedish 
furnaces that a part of the blast furnace gas is used 
as a blast in the place of ordinary air, while the rest 
is made use of in other ways. By this is gained 
that the blast comes in heated, a great loss of heat 
is avoided as the nitrogen of the air is kept out, 
and the vault over the electrodes is protected from 
the intense heat as the blast comes against it and 
and keeps it cool.
As a result of the different chemical reactions 
which take place there is higher up in the furnace 
a mixture of CO and C02 with small quantities of 
other gases. Theoretically one would obtain the 
best use of the coke if all the CO could be changed 
to C02 before the gas passes out, or in other words 
it seems that the furnace should be as high as pos
sible that the CO should have more time to be 
changed to C02. There is no practical difficulty on
account of the concentration law (law of mass 
action) as the partial pressure of the CO at the 
equilibrium of the reaction
2 C02=2 C0+02 
even up to 1,500 degrees C, does not surpass one 
per cent, of the total and at lower temperatures 
must be far under this number. The important 
question to answer is this:
At what temperature does the reduction begin 
for different mixtures of CO and C02 for the spe
cial iron oxid or iron ore which is to be treated?
The experiment was completed for four mixtures
of CO and C02 namely: pure CO, 50 per cent. CO,
25 per cent. CO and 10 per cent. CO.
The pure CO was obtained from oxalic acid and
cons. H2S04, the gas was washed through several 
bottles of NaOH to absorb the C02 that was formed. 
The CO and C02 were then mixed in the desired 
proportion.
The iron oxid used was of Merks manufacture. 
The apparatus used for the experiment consisted of 
a porcelain tube 70 cm. long, around which was 
wound for a length of about 40 cm. a Ni. Cr . wire 
number 14 for electrical heating. And this same 
length was covered with fire clay, asbestos, MgO 
and sodium silicate which forms an excellent heat 
insulation.
To measure the temperature there was set up a 
thermoscouple connected with a millivoltmeter, 
which easily gave the temperature to 5 degrees C. 
The wires of the thermoscouple were of Pt and 
Pt. Ir and were isolated from each other, each 
placed through a hole of two holed porcelain tube. 
To protect the wires against harmful influence of 
CO gas during the heating they were placed in a 
quartz tube which was closed with a rubber stopper. 
Through the rubber stopper was a glass tube to 
give communication with the air outside, that the 
air might escape during the rise in temperature. 
CO and C02 were conducted from the tank contain
ing the mixture through a wash bottle to a second 
glass tube in the exterior rubber stopper. Finally 
was the exterior porcelain tube closed at the other 
end by a rubber stopper with a glass tube to prevent 
disturbance by air currents. The tube was heated 
first as a trial to 1,100 degrees C.
The little boat which was used was filled with 
about 6 gram iron oxid and was brought to a glow 
and weighed before each reduction as a control 
ihat the loss of weight was due to reduction and not 
to loss by spilling during the manipulation, for it 
was very difficult to bring the boat in and out of the 
porcelain tube. It was placed as near as possible

to the quartz tube with the thermoscouple so that 
the temperature read would agree with the tem
perature of the iron oxid. The current of the gas 
from the gas mixture which was passed through 
the tube wras kept very weak. And the gas passed 
about 25 cm. of the heated tube before it reached 
the boat. Its temperature could therefore hardly 
vary from the surroundings.
When the tube was heated to the desired tem
perature and the gas was flowing the boat with the 
ironoxid was pushed in place and was kept under 
reduction for an hour. The temperature was easily 
kepc within a limit of 5 degrees C. At the expira
tion of the hour, the boat was taken out, cooled in 
dessicator and weighed.
If it happened that the boat had lost more than 
0.0002 gm. in weight the experiment was repeated at 
a lower temperature until it came within this 
limit.
These lowest temperatures were determined for 
the four mentioned gas mixtures and is shown by 
a curve in accompanying figure 2.
An experiment wrhich would come a little nearer 
to the practical conditions ought to be conducted 
with powdered iron ore of the kind used in the fur
nace, and one might also avoid an error, if the boat 
with ironoxid were cooled in the tube by a current 
of nitrogen to avoid the oxidation by the air when 
taking it out. This last is perhaps not of any prac
tical consequence and besides to do the cooling in 
the tube would take an unreasonable length of time.
Assuming that it is possible in the electric re
duction furnace to obtain CO and C02 in a ration 
between eight-tenths and five tenths, then one 
should choose to have the height of the furnace so 
that the temperature of the gases as they escape is 
about 300 degrees C on account of the reduction 
process. The shaft might be made higher if one 
would add extra heat to the material in the shaft. 
But it is a question if it is not more advantageous 
to have a special heating shaft where also that part 
of the gases which again is to be sent through 
the furnaces will be heated still more. After the 
gas has been used for heating or a new charge it
may be utilized still further in gas engine or boiler 
heating in the usual way.

This is one students idea of an ideal course in 
technical training:
Modern Dancing, 6 hours a week; Fussing, 10 
hours a week; Physical training, 8 hours a week (jaw 
exercise at the table preferred); Technique of 
Esthetic Oversleeping, 2 hours every morning; Check 
Endorsement Practice, 1 hour a week; the remainder 
of the time to be devoted to drawing (study of how 
to draw the breath with the greatest economy of time 
and exertion).

The romance of the reaper the Topic.
Last Tuesday evening Mr. George F. Wheeler 
gave a lecture to the students and the public in 
Room 104 in the Applied Industries Building. He 
used colored views and motion pictures in the giving 
of his talk, which covered the history of the reaper 
from the ancient reaping hook to the engine driver 
binder now used in the western farmers.
Mr. Wheeler traveled over America and Europe 
making his study of agricultural conditions and peo
ples and gave a most interesting and instructive 
talk.

The necessity for a thorough going reorganization 
of the Aero Club has been met by arranging a new 
system fo membership and dues.
The club will be divided into three classes, as
sociate, active, and honorary membership.
Associate membership is open to all members of 
the faculty and student body, no requirements being 
made. Dues are $1.00 per year.
Active membership is designed to provide for prac
tical work. The actual construction of an aeroplane 
necessarily must be in the hands of a few. Hence 
a thoroughly comparative examination in at least 
three of the half dozen leading makes of aeroplanes 
will be required for this class. Members of the 
faculty are at liberty to take part in this if they 
should be sufficiently interested. Dues are $1.00 ex
amination fee and two dollars per annum.
Honorary membership is extended to members of 
the faculty and outsiders who show interest or afford 
aid to the club. Necessarily it carries no dues.
Dean Connelly has kindly consented to give room 
104 of the Apprentices and Journeymen to the lecture 
courses of the club. Meetings will be held at 4.00 
p. m. Wednesday, every two weeks unless further 
notice is given. The club has arranged a series of 
public lectures on Aeronatutics with a view to pre
senting the subject to those interested from all points 
of view.
On Wednesday, February 15th, 4.00 p. m. Professor 
Follows will deliver an illustrated popular lecture on 
the history of Aviation. Professor Follows has, with 
considerable pains, prepared lantern slides to accom
pany his talk and will follow out in a nontechnical 
fashion the wonderful development of this latest 
phase of mans ingenuity.
Prof. Follows having paved the way Professor 
Scnapper of the School of Applied Design, will de
liver two technical lectures on the Science of Flight. 
Professor Schapper is an authority on his subject and 
will give as clear an exposition of the technique of 
flight as can be condensed into the time.
Other lectures are in contemplation amongst them 
being a lecture on the action of air and air currents 
as related to Aeronautics. In short a series of com
prehensive lectures will be arranged, open to everyDO WHAT?

Communications from the Harvard Aeronautical

Harvard has an enrollment of 360 and possesses a

The University of Pennsylvania and other col
leges, in all twenty-four, have aero clubs, and are 
active in their work. It must not be said that Car
negie Tech is lacking. Enthusiasm amongst the stu
dents generally and earnest work of the members of 
the club is needed before steps can be taken to con
struct an actual flying machine.
It is the aim of the club to work to the end that 
Carnegie Tech may take a proud position amongst 
the Aero Colleges of the country. We should be 
able to build an aeroplane in Tech, man it ourselves, 
and wrest the laurels from other colleges to place 
them on the brow of the Alma Mater. Boost is the

To the Editor of the Tartan
Owing to the vital influence exerted upon a col
lege both as to the student body and as to individ
uals by a judicious handling of track athletics, I beg 
leave to say a few words in that connection.
Much interest in track athletics is in evidence 
throughout the schools and the prospects are very 
promising for a successful season this spring.
The schedule is practically arranged, and should 
interest every student who has a desire for this 
branch of athletics. It was put before about twenty 
students who attended the meeting at the Field
House, February 6, and most of those men are al
ready working out at the Bedford Avenue Skating 
Rink each afternoon, in preparation for the Ath
letic and Gymnastic Carnival to be given by the 
Central Y. M. C. A., March 10, at Duquesne Garden. 
It is hoped that two relay teams may be entered in 
this meet. One for the Western Penna College 
Championship. Men will also be entered in the 
300 yard novice race, and in the following handicap 
events. 60 yard dash, 600 yard run, 2 mile run, and
12 lb. shot-put. The showing made by the men in 
this indoor meet will help to decide who shall repre
sent Tech at Franklin Field, Philadelphia, April 29. 
For two years Tech men won first in their class at 
this meet, and we earnestly hope a winning team 
may be sent this year.
Last spring, school spirit was aroused by our first 
annual interschool Track and Field Meet, and the 
beautiful Hammerschlag Trophy now adorns the wall 
of the trophy room, bearing the names of the 
Science men who carried off the honors of the day. 
On May 6, at Tech Field, teams from the three 
schools will again strive for honors and needless to 
say the schools of Design and Industries will wrest 
from the Science school the coveted trophy, if pos
sible. At the same date, and combined with the 
above meet, an Interschoolastic High and Prepara
tory School Meet will be conducted under Tech man
agement. This will be our first annual Interschool
astic Meet, and it is hoped all will help to make it 
worthy of repetition.
On May 13, the West Virginia University team 
comes here for a dual meet. Following the above 
dates, a meet is being arranged for out of town. A 
team will also be entered in the Western Penna.

Plans are under way for the production of one of 
the most unique plays ever produced by a college 
dramatic club. The White Friars will have the 
distinction of producing it.
At the first of the year, negotiations were com
pleted and trials were held with the view of stag
ing Seorita, a typical Mexican musical comedy. 
However, for financial reasons and for purposes of 
attraction it was decided to change the policy of the 
Friars for the time being and to produce a bur
lesque instead of a musical comedy. The play will 
be a satire on political Pittsburg. Prominent offi
cials and th leaders in politics in this city will 
be impersonated and a classy production will surely 
result.
The book is being written by two prominent 
dramatic critics of this city while the lyrics are 
being written by the best political rhymster in Pitts
burg.
The play will be put on some time in May in one 
of the downtown theatres.
A call for candidates will soon be issued and the 
best show in the career of the Friars may be antici
pated.

The first address of the series of lectures to be 
delivered once a week to the combined student body 
of the School of Applied Science was given last 
Thursday morning by Judge Joseph Buffington of the 
United States District Court. Judge Buffingtons 
speech was handed to his auditors in a simple com
pelling manner which captured the students from 
the beginning. The speech was of vital interest 
throughout.
Judge Buffington spoke on Ideals in Life, and 
with much earnestness showed the relation of a 
mans self, his ideas and his ideals, to his daily life 
and ultimate success. A short interlude on the sub
ject of uxorious selection prove of intense interest.
It is indeed fortunate that we have been able to 
have had the course opened by a speech from a man 
of Judge Buffingtons experience and insight. It is 
true that our association with big minds and big 
ideas will do more to shaping our future lives than 
any other part of our college career. We there
fore must congratulate ourselves upon the oppor
tunity afforded us and can but call down the deepest 
invectives upon the head of a crooked railroad which 
robbed us of at least fifteen minutes more of the

The Junior Class of the School of Applied Science 
held a class meeting immediately after the general 
lecture last Thursday, President Knapp presiding. 
The election of officers was the chief business at 
hand and the work was carried through quickly 
and painlessly. The officers for the present semes
ter are as follows:
President, Schmucker; Vice-President, Ormston; 
Treasurer, Bryan; Secretary, Koerbel.
After the results of the election was announced, 
President-elect Schmucker was called to the front 
and was solemnly inaugurated and crowned with the 
traditional convicts cap of the class of 1912. Mr. 
Schmucker then took the chair and after the trans
action of several bits of business of minor import
ance, 'the meeting was adjourned.
Beginning with the present term the University 
day at Princeton has been condensed from the old 
scheme of six hours of classes to five. Recitations 
begin at 8:30 and continue until 1:30.

As a preliminary to the Varsity game with Gene
va, the Industrials played a warm basket ball con
test with Carnegie High School. The vistors started 
off with a rush and secured an early lead, but the 
steady playing of the home team brought the teams 
to a tie at the end of the first half. The second 
half was fought on as hot terms, both teams display
ing creditable speed.
Criswell, the little Industrial forward, was the 
star of the game. His shooting had the appearance 
of a Central League star, and made the neighbors 
of Honus Wagner take notice. He scored 17 points 
alone, with eight field goals and one foul. In the 
last few minutes of play Criswell caged the ball 
three times on as many long shots and brought the 
score again to a tie, which was broken just as the 
whistle blew, by a foul by Cole. The score:

At the meeting of the Inter-collegiate Rules Com
mittee in New York during the first week in Febru
ary, but slight changes were made in the rules for 
next season. The meeting was notable for its har
mony and the refusal to make any radical changes 
in the game. The most important change was in 
the rule governing the penalty for failure in exe
cuting a forward pass. Henceforth, the penalty will
take place from where the ball was down, instead of 
from the place where the pass was made. The time 
of the interval between the first and second and 
third and fourth quarters was also reduced from 
three to two minutes, in order to avoid the danger 
of players becoming chilled. Several minor changes 
in the rules affecting officials were made, none of 
which will alter the game.

The Seniors have been having several class meet
ings to prepare for the closing exercises in June. 
Simplicity with a capital S is the watchword of 
each preparation. The games are to be simply but 
effective and unifomity of detail will be strived for.
Owing to the interim week, there was no basket 
ball game last week, but the series will continue. 
Each team is confident of success. Come, girls, 
and root for your favorite team and incidentally help 
it on to victory. Heretofore the girls have had very 
little support in that line and it behooves each mem
ber of each class to stay and show her class spirit. 
The games so far have been remarkable for team 
work and swiftness, so that with the practice of 
this past week, we are confident that the games will 
be the best in the history of the school. In spite of 
the fact that the Plebe team is a comparatively new 
one, the Junior and Senior teams will have to be 
on guard if they want to hold the championship.
