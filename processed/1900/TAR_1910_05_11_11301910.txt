TECH STUDENTS SEND GIFT TO FOUNDER.
Mr. Carnegie is Recipient of Token of Love from 
His Boys.
Andrew Carnegie, founder and patron of the Car
negie Technical Schools, celebrated his birth
day in New York, Friday, November 25, 191*. 
Mr. Carnegie was in good health and keenly enjoyed 
the many evidences of esteem and love which were 
showered upon him by his friends.
Of the tokens received by Mr. Carnegie, none 
seemed to please him more than the handsome silver 
tray which was sent to him by the students and 
alumni of Carnegie Tech. The tray, a beautiful 
product of the silversmiths craft,, contained the in
scription:
To Our Founder,
Andrew Carnegie,
On His Birthday,
As a Symbol of Love From 
His 2,500 Students and 
Graduates of the 
Carnegie Technical Schools.
The gift was carried to New York and was pre
sented to the venerable Laird of Skibo by Geo. H. 
Smith, President of the Alumni Association.
Mr. Smiths selection to the post of honor was a 
singularly happy one. His parents were born in 
Aberdeen, Scotland, near Mr. Carnegies home and 
the brau lad surely found a place in Uncle Andys 
heart. The fact that Mr. Smith is at present em
ployed as assistant to the Chief Engineer in the 
mill of Mr. James Scott, former partner of Mr. Car
negie, is also worthy of notice in this connection.
The gift was the offering of the entire studentbody and alumni, almost every man contributing 
something toward its purchase.

THE TARTAN
CROSS COUNTRY TEAM.
Tech men are showing a singular lack of interest 
in the Inter-school Cross Country Run to be held on 
Saturday. Only twelve men have entered, all of 
these being from the Schools of Applied Design and 
Applied Industries. It is unusual that the Science 
men have not shown more enthusiasm, as they are 
generally well represented in all shorts. Is it be
cause they are lacking in school spirit? We think 
that such is not the case, and fully expect to see a 
number of men enter before the time of the race. 
The runners will start from the Field House over a 
six-mile course laid out in Schenley Park. The P. 
A. A. race on the 17th of December will be over 
much the same ground, and it is expected that the 
team which will represent the schools in this event 
will be familiar with the course.
'VARSITY BASKET BALL.
Manager Blanchard of the Basket ball team, an
nounces that his schedule is now nearing comple
tion. A number of games have already been ob
tained and the negotiations for others are well un
der way. The first call for candidates for the Var
sity will be made some time this week! Mr. McCulloch will coach the team.
GYMNASIUM RULES.
After the regular classes have been organized, 
men not wearing gymnasium suits will be barred 
from the floor. All spectators will be requested to 
take places in the gallery. Mr. McCulloch has sent 
to New York for sample suits and prices of same. 
These will be on exhibition at the Field House as 
soon as they arrive, and may be inspected at any 
time. By ordering in large quantities through the 
school, better prices can be obtained. Orders should 
be left with the locker clerk.
INTER-SCHOOL BASKET BALL LEAGUE.
Physical Director McCulloch is now organizing a 
basket ball league to be composed of teams from the 
various classes of the three schools. He is planning 
to have nine teams in the league, three from each 
of the schools. It is not likely that the seniors of 
either the Science or Design Schools will have a 
team, as they have neither the time nor the men to 
do themselves justice. Varsity players will not be 
eligible to play on these teams, as the idea is to 
give the ordinary individual a chance and to get 
the greatest number possible interested in the sport.
The preliminary schedule, as drafted, calls for three 
games a week. These will be played on the floor of 
the new Field House. Basket ball is comparatively 
unknown to many of the fellows and for this reason, 
if no other, the new laague should be of great benefit 
to the students.
BOTTLE WASHERS CLEAN ENGINE WIPERS
On last Wednesday afternoon Tech Field was the 
scene of the annual football game between the 
Sophomore Bottle Washers and the Engine 
Wipers from the same class. No score was made 
until the end of the last period. Wehr then tried a 
forward pass from behind his own goal line. All eyes 
were iixed upon right end Seigle, but Dutchs feet 
were fixed in the mud. The ball fell to the ground, 
and the game was lost, a safety being recorded 
against the Mechanicals.
The game was played in a veritable ^ea of mud. 
After the first few downs all individuality was lost 
and everyone connected with the game, both players 
and officials, were covered by a thick coat of mud. 
The ball, also, was so coated with it became almost 
impossible to handle, and fumbles were many. Be
cause of this fact, the onside kick was the play 
which gained the most ground, although Taylor and 
Traver pulled off several forward passes.
Mike Kline was the star in the mud gathering 
contest, although Kukovitch pursued him hard for 
first honors. Mike isnt very large, but by earn
est endeavor, he won from contestants who pos
sessed a much greater gathering space. Chuck
Crawford tookstellar honors in the slide for dis~
tance. Amongthose who spoiled the farce by introducia'g realfootball wereBlair, Taylor, and

FOOTBALL NIGHT AT THE NIXON.
Miss Elsie Janis in the Slim Princess captivated 
the hearts of the hundreds of football players and 
rooters who attended the big Football Night at the 
Nixon Theater, Monday, November 28. Tech, Pitt 
and Shadyside teams occupied boxes of honor. The 
Pittsburgh High team did not avail themselves of 
Miss Janis generosity on account of a recent death 
in the faculty of that school. The rooting at the 
show was excellent. The contest between Tech and 
Pitt for the first leg of the big loving-cup offered 
by Miss Janis for the best rooting was exciting and 
the result was in doubt until the very last moment. 
Cheer Leader Keally proved himself a man of con
siderable action and ability. He led the Carnegie 
men in a manner which has never been excelled in 
Tech.
A committee of five prominent dramatic critics, 
after a short, warm discussion, awarded the cup to 
Pitt by a vote of 32, Miss Janis presenting the 
t_ien to Cheer Leader Kirk, of that institution, be
fore the final curtain dropped. The feeling exist
ing among the rooters was of the best and the fre
quent exchange of compliments which was indulged 
in was a credit to both schools.
ART AND PROGRESS.
A little over a year ago the American Federation 
of Arts established as its official organ a magazine 
called Art and Progress. This magazine is unique 
in its purpose to cover the entire field of art. It 
contains articles and editorials on subjects of artistic 
interest, and is illustrated by pictures of great
beauty. It does not pretend to be a sumptous art 
publication, it is rather, a magazine for laymen as 
well as for artists and connoisseuers. The regular 
subscription rate of this magazine is $1.50 per year.
The Directors of the American Federation of Arts 
have recently decided to offer this magazine to the 
students of this school in blocks of one hundred or 
over at a yearly subscription rate of 75c or, in blocks 
of less than one hundred at $1.00.
This is an exceptional opportunity and it is be
lieved that it will prove of great profit to students 
who take advantage of it.
SIGMA TAU DANCE.
The members of Sigma Tau gave a dance at 5141 
Woodlawn avenue, Tuesday evening. November 22, 
1910.
Almost all of the alumni members were present, 
thirty couple making the party. The house was dec
orated with the fraternity colors and pennants of 
every size and description, the Carnegie Plaid play
ing a prominent part.
The earlier part of the evening was spent in 
dancing and becoming acquainted. During inter
mission a lunch was served.
A jubilee chorus took possession before the sec
ond part of the program, being ably lead by several 
of the fair ones present. They drew frequent 
bursts of applause from' the audience.
After a short rest dancing was again resumed with
out interruption until 12.30.
Prof. Follows and wife, and Mr. Esquerre were 
present.
TECHITES GO HUNTING.
Glasser, Abbott, Decker and Porter, the veteraan 
hunters, had another successful season during 
Thanksgiving vacation. All regretted the absence 
of Teo, the sturdy splinter shooter. A total of seven 
rabbits, three pine squirrels and six gray squirrels 
were bagged. Deck says he saw a white rabbit 
with green eyes winking at him from a tree top. 
Porter tried shooting from the hip and Deckers hat 
shows the result. Saturday night, Glasser and the 
game disappeared. The rest of the party trailed 
him hot-foot to Run Corners, where he was dis
covered auctioneering off the rabbits for the price 
of a shave and a railroad ticket home. Abbott went 
in for cross-country runs when he mistook a black 
cat for a ground-hog and got too friendly.
MECHANICAL SOCIETY MEETING.
The Carnegie Mechanical Society will meet on 
Saturday evening, December 3, at 8.15 P. M.
A lecture on Railroad Signaling will be given by 
Mr. Holliday of the Union Switch and Signal Co. 
These meetings are open to all Mechanicals.

EXIT FOOTBALL.
The last game of the 1910 football season has been
played and the weary player has taken up his dustcovered briar for another nine-months of rest. From 
a standpoint of games won, Techs season has been a 
failure; from a standpoint of student-loyalty and 
honest effort, the victory has been overwhelmingly 
ours.
At the beginning of the season prospects looked 
very discouraging. With only two C men back, 
with a green squad and an untried coach, the out
look was anything but promising. However, the few 
faithful entered into the game seriously and de
terminedly. Gradually a team was evolved and when 
the first game was played, a 00 score, with the odds 
in our favor resulted. And so on throughout the 
season, working against the greatest disadvantages, 
our men have played the game hard and well.
Great credit is due to the men who have played 
football, Varsity and scrub, for Tech this year. Suf
fering one defeat after another, they never for a 
moment lost that spirit of stick to the finish which 
is recognized today as the real Carnegie spirit. Out
weighed by more experienced players, they have 
played and fought in a manner that has elicited noth
ing but praise from our opponents.
The student-body also comes in for a large share 
of the credit. Boosting a losing team is the hard
est thing in athletics. By their loyalty and spirit, 
the Carnegie Tech men have more than upheld their 
splendid reputation for being true sportsmen.
Manager Scott proved himself an efficient and 
business-like manager. His work throughout the 
season was of the best.
We wish to offer our sincere congratulations to alt 
these men who have worked so hard to give Tech 
a good team. Honest effort is never lost.
MR. CARNEGIE ADDS TO GIFT.
Announcement was made Friday morning that 
Andrew Carnegie has added an endowment fund of 
$2,300,000 to his generous gift of $1,500,000 to the 
Carnegie Technical Schools.
The income from the $2,300,000 will entirely cover 
the cost of maintaining the buildings and improve
ments to be constructed when the latter amount is 
expended. With the question of maintenance set
tled, it is entirely probable that building operations 
will be started in the near future. However, noth
ing definite has yet been decided.
To the Editor of the Tartan:
The extract which appeared in the Tartan not 
long ago, criticising the ideals of technical students 
as a class, touches upon a subject in which every
C. T. S. man should be interested. As a matter of 
fact, a comparison of the ethical standards of tech
nical and academic undergraduates can be made 
only by one having a wide acquaintance with both 
classes of students. But since the students in both 
institutions are drawn from the same classes of 
people, the criticism, if true, is a criticism of tech
nical education itself, and; as such, is not warranted 
by a consideration of true educational ideals.
These ideals have undergone considerable change 
in the last century. Matthew Arnold said that the 
function of an education is to enable its recipient to 
see life clearly, and to see it whole. This is the 
cultural side. That there is also a practical side, no 
modern educator will deny,and the practical side 
is becoming more important as competition grows 
keener.
If the practical and the cultural are incompatible, 
then truly, technical education leaves something to 
be desired,and so also does non-technical. For 
which is the more acceptable alternative,to be
come a productive member of society with low 
aesthetic and ethical ideals, oi ;o cherish high 
ideals at the expense of society? Of course, the 
alternative is rarely presented, and indeed, should 
never be presented. For the utilitarian and the 
aesthetic are not incompatible. Is it more broad
ening to have a thorough acquaintance with Greek 
philosophy than to have a knowledge of the consti
tution of matter? Will one admire a painting or a 
symphony the less thru knowing how the sensations 
are carried to the brain? Will the odes of Horace 
inculcate a hatred of graft and vice? Is the en
gineer less careful of the rights of his fellows than 
is the economist?
No; our horizon is as wide, our view of life as 
whole thru a technical as thru a non-technical edu
cation,and our usefulness is certainly no less. 
The engineer who lowers production costs and 
makes possible the refinements of civilization and

higher standards of living has no less exalted an 
ideal than has the economist or the moralist who 
theorizes concerning The evil times upon which 
we have fallen, and does nothing to correct them.
A Junior.
Editor-in-Chief, The Tartan:
Dear Sir:I have read with very great interest 
your reprint of article entitled Technical Students 
Ignorant, which recently appeared in one of the 
Eastern College papers. I think that this attack 
upon us should be repulsed, and that every technical 
student should lend his assistance towards this 
object.
I agree with the writer that the technical student 
takes up his particular study with a view to lucra
tive employment. The mere fact that lucrative 
employment ensues from a special study denotes 
that the world has a demand and use for this spcializati.on, at it goes without saying that, the more 
valuable are a mans services to Soqiety the greater 
the remuneration. The idea of getting the most out 
of life cannot but help benefit society, as the man 
who puts the most into life receives the most from 
it. Although the intention of the technical student 
is primarily to befit himself for lucrative employ
ment it does not necessarily follow that on that ac
count he is incapable of rendering good service to 
Society,quite the contrary, as I will show.
What is the meaning of the term Technical?
On referring to several standard dictionaries, I 
note that it is anything relating to a particular 
trade, business, profession, art or science. I would 
therefore, conclude that a qualified technical man is 
a spscialist. It is generally admitted that the man 
who concentrates his studies, aims, and efforts to
wards one goal, or in other words, specializes, is 
the man who ultimately becomes the most service
able to himself and society and the acknowledged 
leader among men in his walk of life, whether it 
be economics, politics, business, art or sciencenot 
by any means the man who strives to gain an equal 
knowledge of all subjects. Would the World have 
had recorded on her annals, the names of such men 
as Stephenson and Watt, famous in the utilization 
of steam, Bell and Marconi, pioneers of two great 
communication systems, Mendelssohn, the soul-in
spiring musician, George Washington, our incom
parable statesman, Landseer, the distinguished 
painter of animal subjects, or to descend to the 
present day, our mighty political gladiator, Ex-presi
dent Roosevelt, had these men failed to focus or con
centrate all their efforts towrards one object? No. 
The man who endeavors to acquire an equal knowl
edge of all subjects always remains in the back
ground, because he lacks the outstanding technical 
quality necessary to bring him to the front. In a 
nutshell, the condition of the average man is due 
to generalization, and that of the eminent or bene
factor of society, to specialization or technical con
centration.
The writer also claims that the technical student 
has no enjoyment in mental pursuits outside his 
specialization. This statement is entirely unfound
ed and convincing disproof of same can be easily 
found by visiting any library for a few moments. 
It is evident that the wrriter has reached his con
clusions by an observation of a very limited number 
of technical men.

MECHANICALS HOLD SECRET SESSION.
Excitement Runs High When Subject of Improving 
Mechanical Hall Comes Up.
The Mechanicals in secret conclave took vigorous 
action regarding the expenditure of $200,000, more 
or less, for the improvement of Mechanical Hall. 
After several hours deliberation, the gentlemanly 
members of the Mechanical Department decided 
upon the following expenditures as being both nec
essary and appropriate. Whether or not the Board 
of Trustees will ratify the list is a matter of con
jecture at this early date. The items:
1. Construction of an underground railway from 
Mechanical Hall to the Applied Science building, 
said railway to be used by Mechanical students dur
ing the stormy weather. This will eliminate all dis
comfort in changing classes.
2. Erection of an elevator from the basement to 
Prof. Trinks lecture room.
3. Purchase of sofas and Morris-chairs upon 
which students may recline and rest themselves 
after working a hard problem in thermodynamics.
4. Purchase of annual shave for Dalas and semi
annual press for Lamorees trousers.
5. Purchase of seven-cylinder limousine for ex
clusive use of those students of the Mechanical De
partment who do not get more than four hours 
flunk per month. The Tartan wishes to draw 
particular attention to the last item which makes 
good scholarship an asset in student activities.
It is only fair to state that the gentlemen who are 
responsible for the above suggestions do not hope 
to have the entire list accepted by the Board of 
Trustees. However, if only a part of the outline is 
followed, the committee in charge will consider its 
work not altogether lost.
BOARD OF CONTROL MEETING.
The last meeting of the old Board of Control will 
be held this evening. Important business will be 
transacted. The election of football manager, hockey 
manager, first assistant baseball, track, and basket
ball managers will probably take place. Letters will 
be awarded to the men of this years team who have 
won them. President Keally will have charge of the 
meeting.

M. M. C. S. was most fortunate last week in hav 
ing two very entertaining speakers address them.
Mr. Campbell, son of Sir Francis Campbell, of 
England, spoke about the blind people of xrnr State 
and of the entire country. He showed by means of 
lantern slides the many industries in which the 
blind may take an active and useful part. Then he 
showed embroideries and samples which were re
markable and would have been a credit to persons 
not handicapped by the loss of sight. He made a 
plea for the blind as organists and piano tuners, 
showing the particular advantage of the well-trained 
hearing of the blind in the latter occupation.
On Wednesday afternoon, Dr. Brashear introduced 
Dr. Wylie, of Washington, D. C. Dr. Wylie is the 
great germ specialist, but he didnt trouble us with 
bacilli. He spoke very highly of our school, our 
work, and our methods. He said the school was a 
miracle, and that he was glad and proud to have 
seen it. He ^hinks that the only trouble that the 
M. M. C. S. girls will have with their husbands will 
be to keep them from hanging around too much; 
but leave it to the girls to manage that.
If thou workest at that which is before thee, fol
lowing right reason seriously, vigorously, calmly, 
without allowing anything else to distract thee, but 
keeping thy divine part pure; if thou shouldest be 
bound to give it back immediately; if thou holdest 
to this, expecting nothing, fearing nothing, but sat 
isfied with thy present activity according to nature, 
and with heroic truth in every sound and word 
which thou utterest; thou wilt live happy. And 
there is no man who is able to prevent this.

PLEBE CLASS.
Plebes0. Industrials0.
Tuesday afternoon, November 22, was the time of 
the second game between the Applied Industries 
and the Plebe Class of the Applied Science. Both 
teams showed a marked improvement over their last 
game. Three times the Science men had the ball 
within striking distance of the Industrials line, but 
were unable to carry it over. The game resulted 
in a tie, neither team being able to score.
Manager Acheson, of the Plebe basket ball team, 
has arranged for several games, and is on the look
out for a first-class team. The outlook for the 
season is the best.
At the class meeting last Wednesday the class 
decided to furnish the team with suits.
AN OMISSION.
In the announcement last week of the Junior Me
chanical Football Banquet, the name of Ormston, 
the official cheer leader of the team, was omitted by 
mistake in the list of speakers given. Mr. Ormston 
will talk on rooting and its relation to the higher 
education. He will take up and discuss from the 
standpoint of their efficacy the various songs which 
have stimulated the team on to success, giving par
ticular attention to such elevating lines as these:
They can squirm thro any line 
Like rattlesnakes
and
They can rush it like a growler 
Down the line.
As oysters will be on the menu he will make it a 
point to ask of the company present, the question, 
How do you like your oysters?

ABOUT REDHEADS.
Red hair appears to be one of the outward char
acteristics of energy and courage. Most red headed 
people are full of snap and ginger, are loyal to their 
friends and not afraid of anything in particular that 
either walks, swims or flies. If you are averse to 
a physical encounter we would advise you not to 
try any bluffs on your brick-top contemporaries.
There has been unreasonable prejudice against 
red-haired men from the earliest times. It originated 
among the dusky Egyptians. Because Typhon, who 
deprived his brother of the sceptre in Egypt, and 
Nebuchadnezzar, the Babylonian king who arose to 
such heights of earthly glory, and afterward went 
forth to eat grass with the kine, were red-headed, 
the Egyptians regarded red hair with great detesta
tion. So bitter were they in their prejudice against 
red hair that they annually sacrificed a red donkey 
by hurling it from a high wall.
Christians became prejudiced against red hair 
because Judas was said to be red-headed. They 
failed to recollect that the bulging craniums of So
crates, Plato, Alexander, Demosthenes, Julius Cae
sar, Mark Antony, William Rufus, Victor Murdock 
and many other distinguished gentlemen were 
adorned with ruddy filament.
Red-headed women have always been admired. 
Helen of Troy, Aspasia, wife of Pericles, Cleopatra 
and Amelie Rives had red hair.Clipped.

The forge has lately added to its equipment six 
new fires, which were made by the Buffalo Forge 
Co., of Buffalo, N. Y. They are of an entirely differ
ent type from the Sturtevant fires, with which the 
rest of the forge-room is equipped. These new fires 
will greatly facilitate the handling of large classes.
In addition to the fires are five new anvils, of a 
heavier type, made by the Hay-Budden Co., of 
Brooklyn, N. Y. The foundry, under the direction 
of Mr. Dosey, supplied the bases. The total weight 
of the bases is 1,800 pounds.
Bulletin Boards.
The idea of maintaining bulletin boards in the 
various shops is a good one, and should be con
tinued. From an educational standpoint, they are 
a success, since there are always good articles 
posted, from which much can be learned.
Seventeen men have won their Y this year in 
football at Yale.

INCIDENTS 
By Wee McGreegor.
A young gentleman from Tech was riding from 
town to the Schools the other day. He was very 
comfortably seated in the crowded Red Line car. 
When he had ridden two blocks a young lady, of per
haps eighteen summers, entered the ca.r and stood 
in front of him. The Techite arose and politely 
offered her his seat. Please keep your seat; I am 
just as able to stand as you are, said the sweetyoung thing. The gentleman stared a moment in 
surprise, bowed very low and devoutly cussed his 
luck that he did not have two seats to give up. The 
lady accepted his kindness, graciously thanking him. 
Now, whether or not the young lady was a Votes 
for Women advocate matters little. However, tell 
me: How many real, dyed-in-the-wool suffragettes 
have included THIS phase of sex equality in their 
creed?
The following conversation inadvertently over
heard puts a new light on the hobble skirt question:
Oh, what a nice new hobble suit. Do you like 
it? Oh, its too cute for anything. How much 
around the bottom? Twenty-eight inches. Oh, 
divine! By the way, I thought you were not going 
to buy a new suit this year. Well, I didnt expect 
to, but I found an old discarded skirt in the closet 
the other dayone of those full, flowing affects that 
they used to wearand by a little quick work I 
converted it into this. How do you like the coat? 
Say, what do you think of that for conservation of 
domestic resources?
SOPHOMORES.
Now that the foot-ball season is over, the eyes 
the eyes of the student body are turned to basket
ball. The Sophomores expect to have a regular 
class team which will be able to give a good ac
count of itself. Last year the 1913 team, composed 
of alair, Baird, Clements, Schuckman, Saunders, 
Mandeville and Dyer, made an enviable record 
against neighboring school teams. From the 
amount of enthusiasm shown at present, the differ
ent departments wrill organize teams and inter-de
partment games will become a test as to the real 
superiority of Mechanicals, Civils, etc.
Plebes, we congratulate you on the spirit you 
have shown lately in regard to the green caps. It 
tOok you a long time to learn, but that was more or 
less expected. Do not think, however, nowr that
