Excellent Production Staged at Duquesne Theatre.
At last! The White Friars have 
pulled off another show. In spite of 
the confident predictions of a num
ber of misguided parties,that the 
Friars were dead, it was some show.
The production was a revival of 
the Friars most successful vehicle, 
His Highness, the Chef, brought 
thoroughly up-to-date, with new 
whistly music, written especially for 
this performance by W. P. DeLong. 
Too much credit cannot be given to 
Mr. Walter B. Edmundson, who 
wrote the book and lyrics and staged 
the production, and to Manager H. 
P. Smith, who looked after the busi
ness end, for their untiring efforts 
to make this years show a success.
In spite of the fact that the danc
ing in the opening chorus was a little 
uncertain, great improvement was 
noticed in the succeeding numbers, 
reaching a climax in the most intricate 
dancing in the Russian specialty.
The undoubted feature of the first 
act was the Coles Phillips specialty, 
which is easily conceded to be one 
of the dainties and most delightful 
seen on any stage this year.
R. M. Crawfords singing of The 
Message of the Waltz was easily 
the hit of the second act, and encore 
after encore was demanded.
As for the cast. W. Jones made 
an excellent Col. Martyn, while Wm. 
Finkel was his scheming wife. I. D. 
Fitzgibbon took the part of thdr 
charming daughter and carried it off 
to perfection. He was particularly 
striking in his love scenes with R. M. 
Crawford, who showed his excellent 
baritone voice in the songs assigned 
to him. W. R. Spahn, as Kuchenkraut, the Chef, O. M. Tishlarish, as 
the Prince, N. K. Kann, as Ted 
Schpyler, Victor Rigaumont, as Capt. 
Dumay, U. C. Bearinger, as Sparks, 
the Chauffeur, and E. M. Sanborn, as 
the detective, were all in fine fettle, 
and did their parts justice, while W.
B. Chaifant, as the old maid, Pricilla 
Prynck, was a scream. Of the chorus, 
Fleming was among the best of the 
dancers, while Evans made the pret
tiest girl.
Thanks is also due to Mr. Jos. R. 
Gousha, who acted as Press Agent 
for the company.
The members of the dancing chorus
COMMENCEMENT INFORMA
TION.
The 1912 graduates will receive this 
week their Commencement invita
tions. Members of the under classes 
can secure invitation by calling at the 
office of Mr. Tarbell, the Registrar.
A new arrangement this year pro
vides reserved seats in the first bal
cony for the parents of those who are 
receiving their graduation documents.
It is understood that many mem
bers of the Charter Class of the 
School of Applied Science, who have 
met the Faculty requirements, will be 
present to receive the degree to which 
they are now entitled.
Tickets for the Commencement 
luncheon at the Hotel Schenley at 
12:30, June 14th, can be secured at 
the Registrars office for 75 each. As 
the service this year is to be at tables 
it is important and necessary that 
tickets be secured before 5 P. M. 
Thursday, June 13th. Ample provis
ion will be made for those securing 
tickets in advance. In case of emer
gency, tickets can also be obtained 
at the office of the hotel before the 
luncheon, and as far as possible ar
rangements will be made to serve ad
ditional guests, but holders of advance 
tickets will be entitled to first serv
ice.
This being the first year the Insti
tution has conferred Bachelors de
grees, a Baccalaureate Address ap
pears as one of the events of Com
mencement week. The address is pri
marily for the faculty and those who 
are to secure graduation documents 
this year. It will be given in the Lec
ture Hall of the Carnegie Institute, 
and tickets will be required for admisW. & J. LOSES SECOND.
were: DeWolfe, Kingsley, Savage,
Wilson, Corbett, Hilger, Franks,

Those who sang in the Glee chorus 
were: Frampton, Cameron, Kinde,
Boyle, Murray, Orrill, Dillenbach, 
Kukovitch, Klein, F. S. Crawford, 
Woellmer and Hollister.
Taken all in all, the production 
compared very favorably with the 
production of 1909, and can take its 
place with the Mask and Wig, Prince
ton Triangle Club, and other college 
plays seen here in the past few sea
sons,
W. & J. engaged in a hopeless 
struggle with our team on Tech Field 
last Saturday afternoon. The Wash
ington team was sent home with a de
feat of 7 to 0. Carts was at his best; 
he allowed one hit and had 15 strike
outs. The solitary hit was delivered 
by Haymaker in the first inning, when 
he shot a fast double into right field. 
Gearhart starred in the third, by trip
ling with two men on bases. A not
able feature of the game was the poor 
fielding of W. & J.s left fielder, 
Pierce, who dropped three flyers and 
entirely lost sight of one, thereby let
ting in a run. Pitcher Haymaker can
not be blamed for the defeat; his 
pitching was fairly strong and the 
fault lies with his support.

CARNEGIE TECH WINS THE 
MEET AT SHARON
The annual Intercollegiate track 
and field meet of Western Pennsyl
vania was won by Carnegie Institute 
of Techology with a total of 47 1-3; 
Allegheny third, with 27 5-6; Wash
ington fourth, with 20 1-2; Grove City 
College fifth, with 14 and Geneva Col
lege sixth, with 9 points.
Two new records were set for the 
meet: Pierce of Grove City lowered
the two-mile record from 10 minutes, 
32 seconds to 10 minutes 26 seconds, 
while Ashton of Westminster heaved 
the discus 121 feet 9 inches, breaking 
his former record of 117 feet.
The meet was hotely contested 
throughout and it was not until the 
last race, the relay, that the event was 
decided.
Westminster led until the 220-yard 
line, when Hosey, Steinmetz and Boots 
of Tech placed and tied the score with 
Westminster at 42 1-3 points. Tech 
then won the relay, with Westminster 
fourth, thereby winning by four 
points.
In the 100-yard dash the judges 
were unable to decide who won the 
event, Hosey of Tech being picked by 
different judges to be first, second and 
third. The event was finally decided 
a tie between three men.
Hosey was the individual star of 
the meet, tieing for first in the 100, 
taking second in the 220, winning the 
440 and then practically winning the 
one-mile run for Tech.
Tech had hard luck in the high hur
dles, Crawford breaking the tape a 
good five yards ahead of his oppon
ents, but the judge found that he had 
knocked down three hurdlers, so he 
was disqualified, Wilcox of Tech fin
ished fourth, but also met the same 
fate.
The stellar events of the day were 
the mile, two-mile, quarter mile and 
the mile relay races. In the first two 
it was a fight between Wait of Tech 
and Pierce of Grove City, the latter 
winning the two events on the sprint.
In the quarter Flosey led all the 
way, with Conway of Westminster at 
his heels, and Brush of W. and J. in 
close pursuit. Steinmetz of Tech fin
ished fourth after a pretty race after 
being set back three yards at the start 
and being boxed until near the finish.
SENIOR BALL JUNE 13th

---------------------------------------------------

2THE TARTAN
THE TARTAN
PITTSBURGH, PA., JUNE 6, 1912
THE FIRST SCHOLARSHIP.
To the Editor of The Tartan:
I believe it is a common diversion, 
in meditative moments, to look at the 
oak, and then to speculate as to the 
acorn which gave it birth; or, having 
the acorn, to amuse ones self with 
mental pictures regarding the ultimate 
tree.
I can put my finger just now on 
something at Carnegie that promises 
to be an interesting acorn. Youll 
hardly find it unaided, the setting be
ing somewhat bulky and prosaic, so 
I shall have to tell you that it takes 
the form of a mere dozen or so in
conspicuous lines which appeared, for 
the first time, in our last annual cata
logue. As it is the sort of seed that 
blossoms most frequently when col
leges have their commencements, the 
matter becomes pertinent at this sea
son of the year.
In those lines is set forth the fact 
that the Alumnae Association of the 
Margaret Morrison Carnegie School 
has established a tuition scholarship 
for a student who would otherwise be 
unable to enter the institution. The 
Board of Trustees, it is true, has since 
created several entrance scholarships 
for 1912, but the credit of being first 
in the field, the honor of being the 
first group of graduates to make a 
service offering of this type to the 
Alma Mater, belongs to the girls of 
the classes of 1909, 1910. and 1911, the 
first three-day classes to go out of the 
School. As a matter of record it is 
important, therefore, to note the 
foundation of this scholarship, the 
first one in the history of the insti
tution. The girl who enters next fall 
as the beneficiary under this gift will 
head a procession of scholarship stu
dents at Carnegie, regarding the 
length and character of which one 
might indulge in almost any fancy.
Few things in college life and work 
present a more attractive side, in re
sults and in sentiment, than the new 
spirit which, of late years, has moved 
graduates of so many American col
leges in the matter of giving scholar
ships. The number of seniors fin
ishing courses at the different institu
tions this June on money furnished 
by old grads, probably reaches a 
total well beyond the most liberal 
estimate. The arrangement, from any 
point of view you look at it, is admir
able. As a tie that binds, it is thriceblessed; it enriches the life of the 
new student, of the old graduate, and 
of the college. It answers the call 
of the other fellow for a chance to 
get the education you got, and the 
call of the college for the sinews to 
perform the service.
Recently, I saw this spirit of obli
gation to ones Alma Mater wellstated as follows: A graduate of a
college who does not acknowledge his 
indebtedness to the college, and who 
is not willing to do something to pay 
off a small part of the interest of that 
indebtedness, by enabling some one 
else to go to college, does not de
serve to be called an alumnus of the 
college.
It is interesting in this particular 
respect, to see the college boy and 
girl develop into the college man and 
woman. At eighteen, youth storms 
the academic portals, crying What 
is this college going to do for me? 
With a better perspective of the prop
er relationship between the two, and 
with the growth of that tremendously 
fine thing called college loyalty, this 
cry becomes less and less re-current, 
until, when the reminiscent spring 
days of the senior year come round, 
it is more apt to be What can I do 
for my college?
A certain class entered Harvard in 
the late seventies with the usual 
freshman attitude of mind, that of 
expecting much and giving little.
When that class came back for its 
twenty-fifth re-union it brought a 
$100,000 as a gift to build the Harvard 
Stadium. Since that day every class 
returning for its 25th hands the 
President at the Alumni Commence
ment Meeting a draft for a similar 
amount. Is the college in urgent need 
of this money? No, but that isnt the 
question. Those men need to give
that money as the outward visible 
symbol of their inward allegiance to 
the university they wish to serve and 
to honor.
From this Harvard custom, which 
perhaps represents, in a monetary
sense, the maximum recognition of 
college loyalty from an alumni body, 
down to annual scholarships of $25, 
or $50, runs the story of the new 
relationship between the college and 
its graduates. We are all better 
Cornell men now, said the president 
of the Cornell Club of Chicago, than 
when we were in college, and he was 
right. And it is because this is so, 
that Yale, Dartmouth, Princeton, 
Harvard, Boston Tech., Columbia
and other college alumni clubs are rap
idly coming into existence in every city 
in the country, and the first duty they 
try to perform is to raise a scholar
ship to send some promising lad to 
college. Here in Pittsburgh, the Yale 
Scholarship Trust, of which Mr. Field 
happens to be secretary, sends a boy 
to Xew Haven every year, and the 
Harvard Club sends three annually 
to Cambridge. I understand that both 
Columbia and Rensselaer do the same 
thing.
To close, Im going to cite the case 
of Wyman, 48, of Princeton, as illus
trating in a curious way the grip a 
college sometimes gets on the heart 
of one of its sons. Here was a man 
who came out of college in 1848, lived 
an obscure and lonely life in the his
toric little town of Salem, Mass., made 
money in real estate, never showed 
up at any of the reunions to revive 
old memories, and yet cherished all. 
his long life a consuming though si
lent passion for his college. He died 
recently at the age of eighty-two, and, 
much to everyones astonishment, left 
the entire result of his lifes toil, some 
$10,000,000, to Princeton.

CARNEGIE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY : : :
T
HE Carnegie Institute of Technology consists of four 
separate schools, each with its own faculty, buildings 
and student body. The courses of instruction 
offered in these four schools differ widely.
School of Applied ScienceOffers courses in chemical, 
civil, electrical, commercial, mechanical, metallurgical, 
mining and sanitary engineering.
School of Applied DesignOffers courses in architecture, 
interior decoration, illustration and painting, open to both 
men and women.
School of Applied IndustriesOffers industrial courses in 
machine construction, building construction, and elec
trical equipment and installation. Short courses are offered 
in the various trades for applicants with experience. A 
new course to equip men as teachers in manual training 
and in trade school work is also offered. The increasing 
demand for such men provides an attractive field for the 
progressive young mechanic and the public school teacher
Margaret Morrison Carnegie SchoolFor women only. 
Offers courses in household economics, secretarial work, 
dressmaking, and costume illustration and design. Be
cause of the demand for trained teachers, graduate courses 
are offered for those who wish to prepare for the many 
positions now open for women in these newer lines of work.
Night CoursesThe four schools offer night courses in 
practically all of the above subjects to provide educational 
opportunities for those who are at work during the day.

THETARTAN
WHATS WHAT AND HOW. j
Camping is the most subtly dia
bolical method ever devised of of
fering gratuitous insult to ones de
fenceless physical and spiritual being.
It is one of the many delirious 
phases of that incurable human di
sease known as having a good time. 
It is the natural and worthy heritor 
of the hair shirt and the evangelistic 
gad with which genial early Christ
ians were wont to tell the flesh where 
to get off, so to speak.
You can concentrate more high ten
sion misery into twenty-four hours 
of one of these illicit affairs with na
ture than you could extract from a 
continuous week of exams in Math.
Ninety-nine per cent, of the care
fully disguised pleasure (?) of camp
ing are confined to the weeks of prep
aration that precede the actual per
petration of the crime.
There are mild thrills inspired by 
the wildly exciting inventories of ba
con, ham, dog biscuit etc. executed 
during the Spring rehearsals to the 
horror of ones civilized and effete stom
ach. But these are mere ripples 
to the thrills generated while do
ing time in the wilderness by 
waggish streams of rainwater slid
ing blithely down the protestant chan
nel of ones backbone during the night 
watches, and by the exhilarating dis
covery that some wierd and informal 
reptile has gone to bed with one.
And that camp bed of which you 
have read such ingenuous and men
dacious fables. How you sink into 
it with a sigh that blows out the light 
and immediately float into the velvet 
embrace of dewy slumber or words 
to that effect.
These beds are constructed, accord
ing to Hoyle, of fragrant balsam 
boughs and they make your soul curl 
up its toes and purr. Well, you may 
sink into it with a sigh but you will 
immediately and impulsively rise again 
with the sigh exploding like a rocket 
into fragments of language that is 
best preserved on asbestos paper. Af
ter you have changed the topography 
of your virtuous couch by reducing 
the altitude of some of its mountain 
chains, and shifting the saw logs 
about, accompanying yourself the 
while with a subdued but evidently 
devout incantation concerning the 
natural life, you lower yourself into 
it again with a discretion born of ex
perience.
A camp bed is a sort of night school 
of misapplied anatomy. Every noc
turnal session is an effort to solve 
the equation between your fairly con
stant (but afflicted) physique and the 
militant variables in this turbulent 
surface.
And then you tear your stomach 
away from dietetic associates with 
which it has been on more or less 
familiar terms and match it for a fin
ish fight with heavy weight comesti
bles out of its class. When you return 
you spend six weeks effecting a work
ing compromise with your outraged 
liver, and aren't fit to live with until 
this arbitration treaty is accomplished.
It is a piquant game to rescue ob
trusive ants from a watery grave in 
the condensed milk and to beat the
thousand or so other insect aborij gines to your food, to say nothing of 
| warning the rest of the wilderness 
[ out of the flapjacks.
It is an unadulterated joy, too, to 
j rise in the biting gray dawn and build 
j the camp fire seventeen times while 
| avalanches of smoke pursue you 
I around the sickly flame.
It is highly edifying to fill the role 
| of menu for the annual pan-hellenec 
| banquet of all the insect fraternities 
I and sororities in the wilderness, and 
j later in the fuzzy darkness to awaken 
| out of the sleep of exhaustion, to find 
your late guests holding their Junior 
j Prom, on your parboiled countenance, 
i while the mosquito seems-funny but 
j isnt) orchestra, perched high on the 
| bridge of your nose saws off the rij bald strains of The Gangs all Here. 
Those whose light fantastic toes are 
sore are industriously drilling for oil 
in the juicy spots on your luscious 
anatomy.
Oh, sure, camping is one of the 
rare joys of a gay existence. Now 
that the pestiferous Faculty will soon 
cease from troubling, let us hie our
selves to the fragrant forest where 
trouble lies about in large chunks.
THETA XI GRANTED CHARTER.
The members of the Gamma Kappa 
Club are much elated over the fact 
that they have been granted a char
ter making them Pi Chapter of Theta 
Xi national fraternity. Theta Xi is 
the oldest and strongest engineering 
fraternity in the United States and 
has chapters in such schools as Yale, 
Cornell, Columbia, Boston Tech, Ste

P. and the leading western engineer
ing schools.
The granting of this charter means 
much for Carnegie Tech, as it shows 
that its reputation has gone abroad 
and is recognized by the students of 
other schools as at least their equal.
Among the long list of Pittsburgh 
Theta Xi Alumnae are found the fol
lowing names: William E. Mott, A.
J. Wait, Julain Kennedy, William E. 
McKelvey, and E. R. Marvin, Stew

met in a dual tournament at Wash
ington on Saturday, June 8. These 
matches should be occasions of spec
tacular play, for the Red and Black 
team ranks high among local col
leges.
