VoHOOL AT MAVV M..TlNG.LEHIGH Downs PLAID; SPURT III LAST QUARTER
To help the students to know their 
school better was the purpose of 
Director Hamerschlags lecture to the 
Science School at their mass meeting 
Wednesday, October 14, 1914, in
Room 209 Science, at 10:30 A. M.
Ive come over this morning not 
to deliver an oration or a lecture, but 
to give you some knowledge of your 
Alma Mater the Director began. 
The students here know mighty little 
about the big things back of The 
School of Applied Science. And if 
you know so little about this school, 
you must know less about the other 
three.
The big problem has been What 
are we going to do to make every 
man absolutely sure that his time here 
is not being wasted? First of all 
we wont let anybody graduate here 
unless he has given evidence of in
tellectual courage. The faculty of 
this school determine to test you, 
your patriotism, your interest, and if 
there is any one in this assembly who 
hasnt had enough to try his courage, 
let him stand up, and Ill see that the 
faculty gives him enough. The men 
who graduate from the School of Ap
plied Science are able to work.
In the second place we want to 
test you for your natural aptitude. 
Many failures are due to these rea
sons; either they lack the ability to 
make the best of what they know, or 
else they have a continual grouch on, 
or else they are physically unfit. 
There is one factor absolutely essen
tial to success, self control in defeat. 
To this end the faculty is further de
termined to control Student Activi
ties which run riot in other institu
tions.
Third, we want you to have the 
ability to consciously know something 
without boasting about it. The fac
ulty has tried to bring humility into 
this institution. Weve tried to be 
conservative and work out our des
tiny based on honest truth. You 
must have a certain respect for ath
letics. You are not going away to 
make apologies for a professional 
team which represents you.
I know of nothing in America that 
needs correction more than the hum
bug, the fake, the false advertisements 
of so called higher institutions of 
learning. In one catalogue 750 
courses were offered by three profes
sors, and upon investigation it was

Last Saturday Tech made its ini
tial bow of the season before one of 
the big leaguers of the college foot
ball world. The Plaid journeyed to 
South Bethlehem to help Lehigh dedi
cate Taylor Field and incidentally to 
meet them in a football game. Le
high was returned the winner by the 
score of 24 to 20, but the result was 
virtually a victory for Tech. Lehigh 
had expected easy sailing over our 
boys and were greatly surprised at 
the stubborn fight they encountered. 
Tech showed great strength and 
clearly outplayed their opponents at 
most every angle of the game. The 
line held well and the men tackled 
hard; in fact, the tackling was so 
vicious at times that it resulted in 
several fumbles on the part of Lehigh. 
The only part of Lehighs team that 
was superior to Techs was the backfield. This superiority was due en
tirely to a matter of weight. Le
highs backfield averaged about 170 to 
145 for Tech. The Lehigh backfield 
ran hard and fast, besides interfering 
well; invariably there were two or 
three men to protect the runner. If 
the brand of ball that Lehigh pre
sented was of the big league nature, 
then our team can compare favorably 
with the best, and the big teams could 
only beat our boys by overpowering 
them, and not by a superior brand of 
football.
The game throughout was hard 
fought and the result was always in 
doubt; first Tech led and then Lehigh, 
the game see-sawing until the last 
five minutes of play. The play that 
ultimately resulted in the winning 
rcore for Lehigh was a doubtful one 
and came well on in the fourth quar
ter. The score was 20 to 14 in favor 
of Tech and prospects for a win 
looked rosy. Our boys worked the 
ball to the Lehigh 20-yard mark, from 
where Kreider attempted to make a 
forward pass to Kessner. Lehighs 
men were charging fast and as the 
result Kreider had to hurry the pass. 
The play failed and the ball was 
grounded, Sawtelle picked up the pig
skin and ran 80 yards for a touch
down, recovering the ball in a sup
posed fumble. The entire play rested 
on the judgment of the officials. If 
Kreider had passed the ball as it ap
peared he had (because the ball ad
vanced about five yards from the spot 
where he was standing) then Tech 
could onlv have lost a down or in the
THlV lV T.oHV oHANo. TO 
.V.N UP.
most a 10-yard penalty for intention
ally grounding a forward pass. But 
if the Lehigh man had charged into 
Kreider and struck him before he was 
able to make the pass, thus causing 
a fumble, then the touchdown was 
legal. From a Tech point of view, 
evidently the former was the case and 
the touchdown should have been dis
allowed; from a Lehigh point of view 
and from the standpoint of Referee 
Fonda, who incidentally was a South 
Bethlehem man, the ball had been 
fumbled. The whole thing was a 
matter of debate and after a consid
erable conference, the officials agreed 
that the touchdown had been made 
legally. The decision was a painful 
one and while we shall give Lehigh 
credit for the victory, we will say that 
the game was won on a rather flukey 
play. We can indeed console our
selves by the fact, that Carnegie out
played Lehigh at most every stage 
of the game. The star for Lehigh 
was Quarterback Cahall. He ran the 
team in excellent style beside being 
an apt hand at forward passing. His 
open field running and return of punts 
was of the most sensational order. 
Time and again, he made large gains 
and he was a hard man to stop once 
he acquired speed. Cahall was 
Techs stumbling block and if our 
men had been able to stop him, there 
would have been a decided Carnegie 
victory. Cahall looks like a worthy 
candidate for one of Camps AllAmerican teams. Halsted at full
back also put up a good game, as did 
the rest of the Lehigh backfield. For 
Carnegie, the entire team played well, 
Mitchell starring on the offense and 
Lauer and Capt. McCaughey play
ing the stellar defensive role. Mitch
ell scored the first touchdown on a 
trick formation and carried the sec
ond one over on a short forward pass 
from Kessner. Lauer broke up the 
Lehigh interference well and got his 
man for a substantial loss on several 
occasions. Capt. McCaughey tackled 
hard and played Lehighs end runs 
well. Kessner did some pretty open 
field tackling. On three separate 
times, Cahall got away from the 
crowd, only to be brought down in 
the open by Sunnys good tackling. 
Bull Crawford followed the ball 
well and succeeded in capturing a 
fumble in midfield and running for a 
touchdown. Tt is hard to pick out

Too much praise cannot be be
stowed upon our football team for 
their work of last Saturday. For the 
results were a victory for us in spirit 
if not in actuality. For what did we 
accomplish? We played to a stand
still a team that had decisively beaten 
the Indians and had outplayed Yale 
for one whole half. The comments in 
the Eastern papers after the game 
were all praising the plucky game put 
up by our light team. It was a heart
breaking struggle to lose, but with 
that remark let us lay aside all post
mortems and look to the future.
The next contest to be staged on 
Tech Field will be that with Grove 
City next Saturday. This institution 
has been a most formidable rival in 
the past but is this year somewhat of 
a mystery. With substantially the 
same team that held us to a narrow 
victory last year, this season they 
seem to have been unable to roll up 
their accustomed scores. Their first 
game with Slippery Rock Normal re
sulted in a tie, 7-7. This was followed 
with a defeat at the hands of Thiel, 
10-7, and another last Saturday to the 
strong Hiram team, 13-10. Waynesburg, Whom we defeated 55-0, won 
from Thiel last Saturday, 35-0. But 
then, as has been demonstrated before, 
football scores cannot be eguated.
In the past Grove City has been no 
mean foe. In 1908 we won, 6-4, lost in 
1910, 16-3, and lost again in 1911, 0-11. 
The score was tied, 0-0, in 1912, but 
we were victorious last year, 7-3. 
Grove City has come out somewhat 
the better in this exchange, scoring 
34 points to our 16. But Coach Stef
fens hopes to even matters this year, 
although he expects a tough and ex
citing contest.
So everybody out next Saturday. 
Fill the stand and encourage the team. 
Without the presence of the proper 
spirit in the student body, the strong
est team that Carnegie could form 
would play like a lot of schoolboys. 
It is the rooters that may decide the 
game. In the colleges of the East a 
man is considered disgraced who does 
not support his team and the same 
should hold true here. We have a 
team that has excelled already any
thing we have had in years and a 
coach that is doing wonders. The stu
dents must do their share and show 
their appreciation.
Remember, only two weeks more. 
For what? The Pitt game.

L.HlGH AND oARN.Gl..
The dedication exercises of the 
Gymnasium, Field House, and Stadi
um, presented by Mr. Charles L. Tay
lor to Lehigh University, took place 
on Saturday, October 17th, and was 
one of the finest student demonstra
tions ever held at Lehigh. In addi
tion to the splendid address which 
was delivered by Dr. Henry S. Drink
er, president, and the response by 
Mr. Charles L. Taylor, the donor, the 
addresses of the representatives of the 
Alumni Association, the Faculty, and 
the students, carried with them every 
evidence of love, affection, and es
teem, which must have been very 
gratifying to Mr. and Mrs. Taylor on 
this occasion.
The Director represented the Car
negie Institute of Technology and 
was glad to have with him Dr. John
A. Brashear, Mr. William McConway, 
and Mr. Taylor Allderdice, fellow 
trustees on the Committee on Insti
tute of Technology of the Carnegie 
Institute of Technology.
Another evidence of the fraternal 
interest between the two institutions 
was given by the entire student body 
assembled on the athletic field, under 
the leadership of Mr. Charles L. Tay
lor, when they sang as with one voice 
the refrain, Whats the matter with 
Carnegie, shes all right, even though, 
at that time, it looked as though 
the contest was an extremely open 
one with the chances to win in favor 
of Carnegie.
We are hopeful that this associa
tion with Lehigh may strengthen and 
develop so that a rivalry may spring 
up between them and ourselves and 
that contests alternate between the 
two institutions, first in Pittsburgh 
and then in South Bethlehem. They 
are worthy opponents and excellent 
hosts.
VloTORY lN D.F.AT.
Our hats are off to the plucky Plaid 
eleven and its coach. The showing 
made last Saturday against Lehigh 
was very gratifying. Although out
weighed, the lighter Carnegie team 
played their heavier opponents even 
and furnished one of the surprises of 
the week in the football world. Un
less unlooked-for reverses occur the 
result of this contest, changed from 
victory to defeat in the final four min
utes of play, assures success for the 
seasons work and for the new foot
ball administration.
As good almost as a victory itself, 
was the favorable impression created 
by Capt. McCaugheys men, who, in 
the opinion of one of the officials, 
played as clean a game as he had ever 
witnessed. Thats demonstrating the 
real Carnegie spirit.
Now for Westminster and Pitt!
AN .NGlN..RlNG JOURNAL?
There is printed below a letter from 
a Junior of the Science School, sug
gesting and advocating the publica
tion of an engineering journal at Car
negie. The idea originating with a 
student, is a good one, but one which 
must in turn, depend on the students 
for its development. The most serious 
obstacle, as has been the case with 
many student activities, will be the 
uncertain financial support. This 
phase of the problem has been thor
oughly investigated by the proposer 
of the scheme, who states his belief 
that a successful journal can be edited 
if it receives the co-operation of stu
dents, faculty, and alumni to which it 
is entitled. All those interested in the 
launching of this activity are request
ed to voice their opinions publicly 
through the columns of The Tartan, 
in order that the general attitude of 
the Science School may become 
known. Mr. Resnicks arguments are 
well presented in a carefully prepared 
discussion contained in the following 
letter:
October 19, 1914. . 
Editor of The Tartan:
It is a well-known fact that the rep
utation of a technical school depends 
on the type of the men it graduates, 
and, conversely, that the knowledge 
and ability of technical graduates is 
only too often judged by the reputa
tion of his Alma Mater. Loyalty to 
our Alma Mater may then be defined 
as any unselfish act of any student 
or graduate intended to further the 
interests and reputation of the school, 
an act that is invariably rewarded. 
Loyalty to our Alma Mater is shown 
in maintaining high scholastic stand
ing and in participating in the various 
school activities, athletic or non-athletic. To the latter belong the liter
ary activities, which are prominent at 
Carnegie and contribute much to the 
reputation of the school.
The subject of this letter is the es
tablishment of a new publication de
voted to engineering subjects exclu
sively. It may appropriately be 
known as
The oarnegie Journal of .ngineering,
pubilshed monthly during the college 
year by the students of the School 
of Applied Science, Carnegie Insti
tute of Technology, Pittsburgh.
Many of the large eastern technical 
schools have such publications, and 
these have a recognized place in the 
engineering literature, and are widely 
quoted by the engineering press. The 
Sibley Journal of Engineering at Cor
nell is one of them. We are told that 
the Science School ranks now among 
the five foremost engineering schools 
in this country. On the strength of 
this statement it may be said that we 
are scholastically big enough to issue 
a creditable monthly, and that a publi
cation of this sort will thrive and 
flourish at our school.
The .ditorial Policy.
The Carnegie Journal of Engineer
ing is to be essentially a school organ 
representative of the scholastic stand
ing of the School of Applied Science. 
It is to serve the interests of the 
various Engineering Departments 
alike in encouraging original research 
work and in raising the standard of 
scholarship. It is to publish the best 
contributions from any one depart
ment that is of general interest to the 
students of all departments only. In 
its nature it is to be serious and earn
est; conservative and reasonable. To 
be a well written, carefully edited, and 
typographically perfect publication.
Training in Technical Journalism.
Dr. J. A. L. Waddell, an eminent 
engineer, said, There is nothing 
which a young engineer can do that 
will advance his professional standing 
so much as the writing of a good, 
sound technical article for publica
tion; and there is nothing that he can 
do which is more detrimental to his 
reputation than to write an incorrect 
or weak one. The Department of 
English will be glad to take care of 
the English of the contributions made 
by students, if so desired. This, in 
itself, is of great importance, inasmuch 
as it will give to many students the 
opportunity to learn how to write 
good articles for the engineering 
press.
Our Night Vtudents.
Here is a class of students which is 
found in no other engineering school 
whose standard of scholarship ap
proaches that of Carnegie. Their ser
iousness of purpose and their capacity 
for work cannot be questioned. Their 
practical experience in the various in
dustries, combined with the theoreti
cal training they get at Carnegie, 
should enable them to contribute 
much that is of practical value in the 
engineering profession, and that will 
do credit to them and to the reputa
tion of the school.
We Have the Material.
The head of one of the Engineering 
Departments, when asked to express 
his opinion as to the advisability of 
starting this publication, said, I have 
felt for a long time the need of it. 
We have the material and we ought 
to make a success out of it. Several 
other members of the faculty and ad
ministration expressed their approval 
of this undertaking, and we may 
count on their co-operation, provided 
the students will back it up.

Fund for the Relief of Destitute Fami
lies of Artists in France.
We appeal to all of you who realize 
what France has done to develop the 
art of our country and to develop our 
artists by generously opening her 
schools to them; to you who know 
what her artists have done to make 
our land more beautiful by the build
ings and the gardens they have train
ed us to design, and our homes more 
enjoyable by the works which deco
rate them, executed by them and by 
our artists whom they have trained; 
to you who realize the importance of 
all these things and feel that we owe 
a debt of gratitude to the Artists of 
France, we address this appeal.
All the active men of France have 
been called to arms to repell the in
vader who threatens to destroy every
thing which is sacred to them, and 
they have in many cases left their 
families destitute to face a misery 
which is daily growing more and more 
terrible, while the more aged artists 
are totally deprived of the resources 
of their art. We ask you to help 
them.
All monies will be forwarded to the 
Fraternite des Artistes, the Central 
Committee in Paris under the presi
dency of M. Leon Bonnat, Membre 
de llnstitut, which has organized the 
relief of the families of the painters, 
sculptors and architects who have 
been left in need, irrespective of their 
artistic creeds.
Cheques should be made payable 
and mailed to the Harriman National 
Bank, 527 Fifth avenue, New York 
City, and must be marked, For the

May I appeal to your generosity and 
beg of you and your friends to con
tribute toward the support of the 
many needy artists now destitute 
here?
No matter how small the amount 
may be, it would go toward a worthy 
cause.
Checks drawn through the Banking 
House of Brown Bros. & Co., New

known engineering educator, said, 
My definition of success is this: A

We oan Get The Means.
The Carnegie Journal of Engineer
ing will depend for its financial sup
port on its circulation and on the ad
vertising matter it will carry. The 
total cost of printing 1,000 copies was 
estimated by one of the largest print
ing houses in this city to be about 10 
cents per copy. If we could sell about 
600 or 700 copies at 15 cents each, we 
could probably make ends meet. There 
are about 500 Day, 300 Night students, 
and 52 members of the faculty in the 
School of Applied Science, besides 
429 Alumni; all together about 1,300 
possible subscribers. In case of finan
cial difficulties at the beginning, appli
cation for aid can be made to the Stu
dent Activities Fund.
Now ls The Time.
We have the material and we can 
get the means, and since it is bound to 
be started some day, it is best to start 
it now. Procrastination, or any of its 
synonyms and derivatives, is a word 
that is unknown to engineers that are 
of any account. If it is to be done 
right, it must have the co-operation 
of the whole school. And we must 
and can do it. Are we all in favor 
of it?

Dr. A. A. Hamerschlag,
Dear Sir:
In no industry or profession has the 
war worked such havoc as among the 
actors and singers of Germany.
Germany and Austria have about 
380 theaters and over 25,000 artists 
are employed, more than half of them 
receive less than 1,000 marks (two hun
dred fifty dollars) yearly. Only 10 
per cent earn over 3,000 marks yearly.
Only a few (Royal) theaters are 
now playing and have greatly reduced 
their artists salaries, making it im
possible for us to care for the many 
impoverished families.
We find men and women of almost 
all nations on the German stage, and 
hundreds of Americans were given 
their first opportunities in Germany.

WORD FROM oAPT. HAV.LTON.
In a recent letter to one of his 
friends, Capt. Haselton conveyed the 
impression that he will not be able 
to run again. The realization of this 
fact will be a hard blow to his am
bition, for he had been hoping against 
hope to lead Carnegies team on the 
cinder path next spring. Haselton 
is very much interested just now in 
the work of the cross country run
ners as is manifested by his inquiries 
regarding them. His leg is slowly re
sponding to treatment and as soon as 
he has control of it, he will return to 
school.
No additional announcements re
garding the cross country work can 
be made until the manager and coach 
have been officially chosen. With the 
election of the new Board of Control, 
however, some definite action should 
be taken this week. In the meantime 
regular practices are being held.

In the Schenley Theatre next week

This play came originally from the

drama than was the original. In this 
play was a notable cast and one of 
the most important members was 
Nance ONeil, who will assume the 
same role as in the original produc
tion.
The names of the twelve students 
who won the 1914-15 entrance and 
tuition scholarships were announced 
yesterday by the authorities of the 
Carnegie Institute of Technology.
The amounts of the scholarships 
vary from $130.00 to $30.00, and were 
awarded on the basis of high grades 
in the entrance examinations in the 
case of new students, and on last 
years scholarship record in the case 
of old students.
The tenure of the scholarships is 
conditional upon the attendance, con
duct, and progress of the recipients 
being satisfactory to the faculty.
Awards were made as follows: Carl
F. Peters, of Schenectady, N. Y.; Mis 
Bernice Thompson of East Liverpool
O.; Linwood J. Corser of Northfield 
Mass.; Wrilfred A. Roadio of North
ampton, Mass.; Charles H. Kleffman

The Plebes seem to offer strong 
objections to the rules laid down to 
them by the Seniors of the three 
schools concerning their being pro
hibited to enter the new commons 
until twenty minutes to the hour. 
Many persist in violating this rule. 
Until other arrangements are ma le, 
it is best to comply with the notices 
issued in last weeks Tartan and also 
posted on all bulletin boards.

PARTY FOR TH. PL.B.V.
One of the evidences of the excel
lent inter-class spirit existing in the 
school was the party given on 
Wednesday in the new Recreation 
Hall, in honor of the Plebes, by the 
Juniors and Sophomores. An excel
lent opportunity was thus offered the 
older girls to welcome the new class 
and for every one to become better 
acquainted, at the same time, to have 
a good, jolly time. It was a great 
success if the party exclamations of 
guests and hostesses alike may be re
garded as a test, for such phrases as, 
"Didnt you have the best time?" and 
Wasnt it great? and Wasnt that 
cake the best you ever ate?could 
be heard on all sides as the time came 
to go. Most of the afternoon was 
spent in dancing and playing games. 
The one which afforded the greatest 
amusement was pinning the tail on 
the donkey, and great shouts of 
laughter rose as the donkey was suc
cessively given a tail to his nose, his 
ears, his mouth and various other 
parts of his anatomy. Too much 
credit cannot be given to Miss Wat
son, Junior Social Chairman, and 
M iss Wilson, Sophomore Social 
Chairman, not only for the entertain
ment afforded, but also for the dainty 
refreshments offered. Delicious home
made sandwiches and cake, with ice 
cream in school colors, helped a lot 
in making the occasion a memorable 
one. Credit must also be given to 
the other members of the Social Com
mittees, who stayed behind the 
scenes, arranging sandwiches, cut
ting cake, and last but not by any 
means least, washing the dishes.
The hostesses felt very glad that 
the dean and student advisors stopped 
in to see the fun, although by 
necessity they could not stay the en
tire afternoon.

At a meeting held last spring, the 
self government association of the 
Margaret Morrison Carnegie School 
decided to apply for admission to the 
Womens Inter-Collegiate Student 
Government Association. This is an 
organization which is well known by 
all the large womens colleges in the 
United States which are governed by 
student government associations.
Mary Ride, the secretary of our 
student senate, this fall received a 
favorable reply to our petition of last 
spring, and she has further received 
a notice that Margaret Morrison is 
elegible for admission to the asso
ciation, and representatives from our 
college would be welcomed at the 
next Inter-collegiate conference.
This conference is to be held at 
Radcliffe College, November 5, 6, 7. 
Delegates from all the large womens 
colleges will be present, and student 
government associations will be 
treated in such a wray as to furnish 
information and mutual help to all.
At a recent meeting of our selfgovernment association, it was an
nounced that, according to the consti
tution, two delegates should be sent 
from the student body to represent 
the college at the conference. One of 
these delegates must be the president 
of the Student Senate, and of necessity 
a member of the Senior class; the 
other a member of the Junior class.
Lu. M. Hartman was elected last 
year, before the close of the second 
semester, to succeed Margaret Harri
son, the first president of the asso
ciation. Miss Hartman is from Mc
Keesport, and has been a student in 
Margaret Morrison for the past three 
years. During these years she has 
made a splendid record in her college 
work, besides being actively inter
ested in the student activities. She 
has a strong personality which has 
won her many friends among both 
faculty and students.
At the student assembly held last 
Wednesday, Grace Searight was
elected to accompany Miss Hartman
to the convention at Radcliffe. Miss 
Searight is from Logansport, Indiana. 
She entered Margaret Morrison last 
year with advanced standing from
James Milliken University. She is 
president of the Junior Class, and 
junior representative on the Student 
Senate.
Wrhile East, Miss Hartman and
Miss Searight expect to visit Vassar, 
Bryn Mawr, and if possible, other 
large womens colleges.

Thursday afternoon, October 15, 
delegates from the Federation of

the faculty of Margaret Morrison Car

League.
Through the efforts of Director 
Hamerschlag and Dean Breed, Miss 
Zona Gale of Wisconsin was secured 
to open the program, with a lecture. 
Miss Gale spoke to the student body 
and a number of the visitors of the 
afternoon, in the assembly hall of the

Following Miss Gales lecture, Mr. 
Leham of the Bell Telephone Com
pany addressed the assembly. It was 
of interest to learn that the Bell Tele
phone Company has been white listed 
by the Consumers League.
After the lectures, a reception was 
held in the faculty parlors. Receiv
ing were Dean Breed, Mrs. Crabtree, 
and Mrs. Leete, together with repre
sentatives from the Consumers 
League.
Miss Lyon and Miss Parry poured 
tea, and assisting them were Lu. Hart

Eliza Dickey, Helen Stuart, Mary 
McGrew, Lydia Bates, Anna Thomas 
and Ruth Welty. About three hun
dred guests were present.

At the regular assembly last Tues
day, Dean Breed spoke to the girls 
concerning membership of the Guild.
The Guild is the only philanthropic 
organization in our school, and it is 
hoped that the girls will remember 
the words of Dean Breed, and affili
ate themselves with this organization 
at once. The expenditure of money 
is so little for each one, that it is 
scarcely felt, and we want every girl 
in the school for a member.
Each year some worthy charitable 
home or hospital is helped through 
the efforts of the Guild. Exactly 
what will be done this year, has not 
been definitely decided.
Anyone wishing to help the work 
of the Guild may communicate with 
Dorothy Skinner, the president. Miss 
Skinner will be glad to give any fur
ther information concerning the Guild 
and its purpose.

found that 11 students were registered 
in these 750 courses. It has always 
been our policy not to print one word 
in our catalogue that we were not able 
to carry out in detail.
You dont know that you are par
ticipating as the live factors in a great 
psychological experiment. Nowhere 
in Europe or in America has there 
been an institution patterned not to 
give an old liberal art education nor 
the new technological education of 
science alone. What is it that makes 
the technical man successful? We 
made up our minds that the real thing 
we needed, next to a fundamental 
knowledge of facts, was an imagina
tion. We determined to introduce 
again those factors which influence 
the imagination. So we virtually 
made a new curriculum.
We havent been very successful. 
Thats the confession I make to you 
this morning. We dont believe that 
the student here is any more imag
inative than graduates of other tech
nological institutions. What can we 
introduce into the curriculum to give 
you imagination?
A closer acquaintance of the three 
mens schools, more time spent by 
students in the other schools of the 
group, especially in the Design School 
was recommended by the Director 
for the acquirement of imagination.
What is art? Its the expression 
of individuality, that's all the Direc
tor said in this connection. You 
must have an appreciation of life as 
expressed in line, form, and color to 
be truly educated and to have your 
imagination made fertile. When you 
have children the thing you are going 
to wish most is that they may be 
placed in beautiful surroundings.
Im going to say a word about the 
M. M. C. S. It stands among the 
front rank, in fact among the first 
three of those institutions in America 
which are trying to make life beau
tiful looked at from the standpoint of 
the home. Im going to try and make 
some arrangement with the dean oi 
the womans school so that at stated 
intervals you may go through the 
building and see not only the girls 
who are there, but . . . (here
laughter and applause drowned the 
speaker).
I want you to go out and be able 
to answer intelligently any questions 
about your school, for in so doing you 
preach the gospel of Carnegie.

BUlLDlNG BUR.AU DlVBANDV.
The recent discontinuance of the 
Building Bureau has caused one of our 
Tech land marks to pass on into his
tory. Gone as it may be, the work that 
it accomplished in the designing of 
many of our present buildings will al
ways be, a memorial to it.
The bureau was first formed five 
years ago, and was placed under the 
supervision of Mr. Raymond Hood 
the well known architect. The 
draftsman employed there consisted 
partly of Tech graduates and advanc
ed students, and a few other men who 
had been in the affairs of well known 
architects. Among the Tech men em
ployed by the bureau during its ex
istence were Rigamont, Red Jones, 
King, Crosby, Chalfant, and many 
others.
The first work of the bureau was 
the new design school. While the 
work was still in progress it was de
cided to complete Machinery hall, and 
so the plans for that building were 
started. Upon the completion of 
these plans, work was commenced 
upon the wing to the Margaret Mor
rison School, and almost simultaneous 
with it were begun the plans for the 
new Head House, which was complet
ed this fall. The last work of the bu
reau was the completing of the plans 
for the new United States Bureau of 
Mines buildings. These were com
pletely drawn at the bureau, and met 
with the unanimous approval of the 
supervising architect, and the board 
appointed by the United States govern
ment to approve the buildings and 
construction of the new buildings.
At the beginning of its career the 
bureau wras located in buildings near 
the east end of the Industry building, 
as many of the older students will 
remember. It was later moved to its 
present location at the south end of 
the Design building in order to make 
v/ay for the present Head House, in 
which are located the school offices, 
and student club rooms. After the 
building was moved to its present lo
cation, the architects employed there 
constructed a sunken garden, pond, 
and water falls, besides several ter
races, and gravel walks, and so had 
very pleasant, and artistic quarters 
for their work. Whether the bureau 
will ever be continued in the future 
can not be definitely stated, although 
the possibilities are bright that it 
may be if at any time as extensive 
building operations are carried on as 
have been in the past.
A VKY-VoRAP.R VoHOOL.
Those who have been inclined to dis
approve of the rapid advance of the 
technical and trade schools have now, 
in the new school for office-boys, 
started in the New York Woolworth 
Building, an opportunity to see how 
strong is the demand for business and 
industrial training for school-children. 
The school for office-boys is the re
sult of a need universally felt. If the 
young people who come to the offices 
to find work have not learned in the 
city schools enough to enable them to 
perform their tasks thoroughly and in
telligently, so that they may attain to
increased responsibility, then another 
school must be found for them. Cases 
have been known where the boy or 
girl assistant could not file letters al
phabetically because the new method 
of teaching does not start with alpha
betical study. The New York Times 
points out that the Woolworth school 
may be followed by many similar 
schools in office-buildings.

SCIENCE SCHOOL NOTES
TH. V.NlORV-PL.B. VMOK.R.
The new ball room on the top floor 
of the new Administration Building 
has been reserved for Saturday night, 
October 24, in order for the Science 
Seniors to entertain the Science 
Plebes.
Several requests have been sent out 
for features of entertainments. If 
anyone has any good stunts they can 
submit please confer with J. A. 
Cameron, Sen. Commercial, chairman 
of this committee.
All Seniors as well as Plebes must 
be present.
NlGHT Vol.No. 15 ORGANlZ.V.
The Night Senior Science Class 
held their first meeting for the pur
pose of organization, on October 12th 
at the eleventh hour. The class 
officers of last year were re-elected 
and are as follows:
PresidentR. W. Schuette.
Vice PresidentL. S. Cohen.
Secretary and TreasurerJ. T. 
Harmuth.
Class StatisticianA. L. Lambie.
President Schuette then delivered 
an address in which he pleaded for the 
continuation of interest in school 
activities and emphasized the import
ance of devoting every spare moment 
to this work.
Addresses by the other officers fol
lowed and after the class had passed 
a motion extending to the officers a 
vote of thanks for their work in the 
past, the meeting adjourned.
OoTOB.R M..TlNG OF TH. 
MHO oLUB.
The October meeting of the Mho 
club was held in Machinery Hall on 
Friday, October 16. The meeting was 
fairly well attended considering the 
shortness of the notice given.
Among several business matters 
brought up, one interesting point was 
discussed and settled that is of im
portance to the Seniors. Many 
Seniors, either through lack of in
terest or for other matters, have not 
attended the meetings of the club. 
Some of the Seniors are now desirous 
of coming to the club meetings and 
wished to know whether they would 
be permitted to do so. A very lively 
discussion was carried on and finally 
by the arguments of Mr. Ettele and 
Mr. Gumbart, a motion was made and 
carried that any Seniors wishing to 
attend the meetings and join the Mho 
Club could do so by keeping his dues 
paid regularly.
The report of the athletic manager 
decried the lack of large fellows for 
the football team. All big electrical 
students are urged to come out as 
there is talk of granting Mho Club 
insignia to the fortunate ones.
After all the business was brought 
up and disposed of, Mr. Moore of the 
Senior class, gave a very excellent 
and entertaining talk on the subject 
of The Application of Electricity to 
Coal and Coke Workings.
Although the speaker did not go 
into much technical detail, he showed 
excellent knowledge of the subject 
which was gained by living in the 
vicinity of one of the large coal and 
coke centers.
At the conclusion of the address, 
the meeting adjourned for refresh
ments and also for some slight stunts 
worked up by the ingenious Mr. 
Moore.

1 he masked chimney of Carnegie 
Tech is not only an example of beauty 
but also of correct design. This fact 
is not realized until this stack is com
pared with others. On my recent trip 
to Europe, I had the opportunity to 
see several attempts at masked stacks, 
and in every case, I found them in
ferior to our own. In Danzig, at the 
Tech school, a stack and water tower 
were combined and were, designed to 
give the appearance of a mediaeval 
fortification tower. Somehow the 
architect seemed to consider looksfrom-the-street only and consequently 
built only one-half of the fortified 
tower with the stack resting against 
the flat back of the half tower. It 
can easily be imagined that the stack 
and tower when viewed from the side 
or rear look perfectly ridiculous.
Tech schools seem to be a favorite 
place for masking stacks as may be 
judged from the foregoing and from 
the stack of the combined power plant 
and mechanical laboratory at the 
Tech school in Breslau. There a 
stack was put up hidden in a fine look
ing square tower with a winding stairwav having inclined windows and 
with a gallery at the top. Imagine 
the disappointment of the officers of 
the school when the stack did not 
draw. While the stack would have 
been high enough if it had been free 
standing, it was not high enough to 
?llow masking. The ending of the 
stack in a large flat place may be 
compared to the sudden enlargement 
in a nine. Almost all of the velocity 
brad is dissipated in eddies so that 
for the same draft a much higher 
'trek is needed, if it is to be masked 
in the manner iust described. In 
order to operate the power plant, the 
engineers in Breslau put an additional 
c'tr>ck fifteen to twentv feet high on 
architectural stack. This addi
tional tack was built of red brick. 
The trrav architectural square tower 
with the uglv red auxiliary stack on 
ton makes a very funny combination. 
T showed the engineers the picture of 
Machinery Hall and they immediately 
requested that the picture be left there 
so that they might get back at their 
own architects and building commis
sion and thus perhaps obtain a bet
ter design for their own stack.
When observing our own stack at 
Carnegie Tech, one finds that it is 
built open and that air can easily pass 
through the surrounding brick work 
so that the gases leaving the top can 
drag outside air along with them in 
their upward rise. The masking of 
our own stack is therefore no hindP. LUDEBUEHL dltd SON

closed with a rousing talk by the new 
president, A. L. Martel. The splendid 
spirit shown throughout the meeting 
is bound to manifest itself in Plebe 
activities as the year travels on.

Professor Trinks gave a very inter
esting talk before the Mechanical En
gineering Society on The European 
WarIts Influences on Engineering 
and Politics. Professor Trinks was 
in Germany at the outbreak of the 
war, and told of many humorous ex
periences which he had before being 
able to leave Germany. He went on 
to say that as far as the war went, 
he was of the opinion that the pres
ent generation would never know 
just who was responsible for it, as 
the records concerning it will probab
ly be kept secret until all those hav
ing anything to do with it are dead. 
He said that the Germans began mov
ing their artillery and troops to the 
frontier as early as the middle of 
July, and that war had been generally 
expected for several wreeks prior to 
the opening of hostilities. One very 
interesting incident he mentioned was 
that the German nation is self-sup
porting in time of war, and that not
withstanding the war, new industries 
are being developed by the govern
ment, foremost among which is that 
of commercial vehicles, for which it 
is believed there will be an enormous 
demand after the war, owing to the 
great number of horses that will be 
killed.

CARNEGIE SPRINGS BIG SURPRISE
Continued from Page 1 
the individual men because of the 
general good work of our team. All 
the players fought hard and gave Le
high every ounce of their strength. 
Tech played plucky football against 
their much heavier opponents and 
justly deserved to win the game. But 
as it is, the score is a victory; the 
result marks a new epoch in our foot
ball history. We are passing from 
an indifferent team to one that is 
bound to be a consistent winner. As 
said before, big things are in store for 
our boys.
A notable feature about this game 
was the spirit in which all those con
nected with Tech acted. The Design 
Plebes, forty strong, saw the boys off 
at the train Friday with a rousing long 
Carnegie that rang in the ears of the 
players for several minutes. Five 
students accompanied the team on the 
trip and helped form the rooting sec
tion. Although pitted against almost 
5,(XX) Lehigh rooters, they succeeded 
in making their cheers heard on all 
sides of the field. Director Hamerschlag, Mr. Hornbostel, and Dr. 
M. E. Conway, head of the Board of 
Directors, were also present to help 
the boys along. The director lent an 
encouraging hand and showed him
self to be a "good sport." Then 
again early Sunday morning, a band 
of two or three hundred met the team 
at East Liberty and the reception 
that they accorded the players was 
one that will long be remembered by 
all. This spirit is the thing that 
is going to put Tech to the front and 
the entire student body has made a 
splendid showing. We hope we will 
be able to show some of this enthusi
asm over the result against a certain 
team on November 14.
All the men came through the con
test in fairly good shape with the ex
ception of Boilleau who injured his 
hand. It is probable that he will be 
out of the lineup for the Grove City 
game. Fletcher, who replaced Boil
leau, is also in poor shape as a result 
of an attack of boils. He played the 
Lehigh game with his arms in bad 
condition. The rest of the men are 
in fine trim and we expect to have 
practically the same team in the field 
against Grove City that started the 
Lehigh game.
A detailed account of the game had 
not been taken but the writer re
members the general run of the score. 
Hoban kicked off to Tech and in an 
exchange of punts, it was Techs ball 
in midfield. From this point Mitchell 
scored a touchdown. Kesner punted 
out to Balsinger and then missed goal. 
Score: Tech 6, Lehigh 0. Time re
quired for touchdown, four minutes.
Lehigh scored twice in the second 
quarter mainly through the running 
and forward passing of Cahall. The 
first touchdown was made at the be
ginning of the second period by Halsted and the second score came as the 
result of a forward pass from Cahall 
to Desmond. Hoban kicked both 
goals. Score: Tech 6, Lehigh 14.
The Plaid came back strong in the
second half. Oeffinger kicked over 
the Lehigh goal line and the ball was 
put in play on the 20-yard mark. Ca
hall fumbled and Mitchell recovered. 
Several short line bucks brought the 
ball to the 10-yard line, from where 
Tech scored on a forward pass from 
Kessner to Mitchell. Kessner kicked 
goal. Score: Tech 13, Lehigh 14.
Tech kicked off to Lehigh and after 
an exchange of punts the ball landed 
in midfield in Lehighs possession. 
Lehigh fumbled and Crawford 
scooped up the ball and ran 50 yards 
for a touchdown. Kessner kicked 
goal. Score: Tech 20, Lehigh 14.
The score remained this way until 
there were five minutes left to play 
in the fourth quarter. Tech had been 
rushing Lehigh off their feet and had 
planted the ball on Lehighs 20-yard 
line. It looked like another touch
down. After trying two line plays, 
Kreider attempted the forward pass 
described above and Lehigh scored a 
touchdown on the fluke. Hoban 
kicked goal. Score: Tech 20, Lehigh 
21.
Tech kicked to Lehigh and Cahall 
returned about 20 yards. On several 
long end runs, Cahall placed the ball 
on the Carnegie 30-yard line. The 
line held and Lehigh was forced to 
try a field goal. Cahall kicked a beau
tiful drop kick from the 37-yard mark 
with only one more minute to play. 
Marshall replaced Lauer at this point. 
Score: Tech 20, Lehigh 24. The
whistle ending the game blew after 
the next play. The lineup:

successful year for the club. All men 
in the Civil department are urged to 
attend these meetings. There is 
everything to be gained and nothing 
to be lost. Professor Mott gave a 
brief talk on a proposed act requiring 
all practicing engineers to hold a li
