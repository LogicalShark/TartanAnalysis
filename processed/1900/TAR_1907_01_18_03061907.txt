The faculty and students were 
shocked and deeply grieved to learn 
of the death of Dr. Thos. M. Taylor 
on last Wednesday. Although he 
had been with us only since Septem
ber, he iiad gained the friendship and 
respect of every Tech man, and the 
news of his 'sudden death cast a 
shadow of gloom over the entire 
school.
Dr. Taylor was born at Kabe, Japan, 
in 1874,his father being a medical missionary. He was educated at Ober 
lin College, Ohio, receiving the. de 
gree of Bachelor of Science. He 
taught Chemistry and Physics at the 
Williamson Trade School, Philadel
phia,and later entered the University 
of Pennsylvania, where he received 
the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. 
He was then appointed instructor of 
Chemistry at Oberlin College, from 
which place he came to the Tech 
schools. He has written several in
teresting articles for the magazine of 
the American Chemical Society.
The faculty passed the following 
resolutions on Dr. Taylors death: 
Resolutions.
Whereas, it has pleased our Heaven
ly Father to call home to Himself our 
friend and fellow teacher, Thomas 
Maynard Taylor.
We, therefore, the members of the 
Faculty of the Carnegie Technical 
Schools in meeting assembled desired 
to offer to his family our sincere 
sympathy in their great sorrow.
His quiet and courteous manners 
had won for him the affection of both 
student body and Faculty. The rapid 
progress of the students under him 
(Continued on page 2.)
*Read Before the Inventors Society, 
Feb. 26, '09.
There exists in the English lan
guage no reference book to which all 
engineers resort, no universal databook for shop or office. We have 
enough reference books, but they are 
not of the right kind. What the 
average engineer knows is in all ref
erence books, but what he cannot re
member and would like to find in the 
book is not there. The reason for 
this failure of our reference books is 
plain: They are one-man jobs. The
man who tries to mase a real refer
ence book finds it a stiff proposition. 
In twenty years steady hard labor he 
may be able to produce a reasonably 
good book, but parts of it would nec
essarily be obsolete.
The uerman language can boast 
of having the right kind of reference 
books. Its name is: The Engineers 
pocket-book, published by the 
 Huette  Society. (Huette means 
shanty). It is not a one-man job, but 
was compiled by students of a tech
nical school and is kept up-to-date by 
students of the same school. This 
book is found the world over. I have 
been in many" important Engineering 
offices of the United States, and I 
cannot recall a single office that did 
not use the reference book made by 
German students. The Huette So
ciety is a union of engineering stu
dents of all departments in the tech
nical school at Berlin-Charlottenburg. 
The society has always 200 to 300 
active members. The great number 
of workers makes the burden of each 
in compiling and revising the book

1910-
Tarn, of 2-C, was appointed vice 
chairman of the Athletic Association.
Armstrong went to sleep in the 
English room during a lecture the 
other night, but awakened at the 
proper time to answer a question, and 
answer it correctly. He must do all 
his thinking in hs dreams.
There appears to be only one live 
section and one near dead section in 
the whole 1910 class. The other 
sections have either quit or ahe ex
hibited in the new Museum, as mum
mies of the period of 16 B. C., for we 
never hear' anything- about them. All 
the news is from 2-C, with an occa
sional note from 28-D. Wish we 
were more fully informed of the 
whereabouts of A and B.
Our old friend Peters has left 2-C 
to go into A. Guess he lost so much 
sleep in C, on account of the large 
amount of work required from him 
by this strenuous section that he had 
to go elsewhere for his recreation. 
Stay where you are, Feters, and you 
soon will qualify as a label for Egyp
tian cigarette boxes.
Summers of 2-C is one of the best 
after-dinner speakers of 1910. His 
services can be secured for any ban
quet, afternoon tea, or free lunch af
fair by addressing him in care of the 
Tartan. Rates reasonable and in 
proportion.

tive of the Thistle Boarda photo
graph of 1910 would fit. in very well 
with other photographs in the year

aver, has not left us for good. Can 
any one give us information on this 
point?

INVENTORS MEETING.
On Tuesday of last week the In
ventors' Society held their first reg
ular meeting under the new consti
tution, with President Neudorfer in 
the chair. Messrs. Thurston and 
Schumacher, who were to prepare 
papers to be read at this meeting, 
failed to do so owring to the pressure 
of studies. However, Prof. Trinks fa
vored the society with a short lecture 
on the preparation of an engineers ref
erence book. The students of cer
tain German technical institutions 
prepare regularly every three years 
a standard engineers reference book. 
Each student is given a certain depart
ment of the book to work upon so 
that the result of this specialization 
is greater accuracy and efficiency 
than if every one had something to 
do with each part of the book. It is 
thought that such a work might be 
put out by the students of this school. 
---------o---------
The Mechanical Department has 
lately received a number of injectors 
for the use of the students studying 
prime mover design. The Junkenheimer Co., Penberthey Co., Ohio In
jector Co., and Stayden and Derby 
Co., manufacturers of the Metropoli
tan brand, are represented in the col
lection which was presented gratis 
to the school.
The Richie Abrasion Machine has 
been set up in the laboratory and 
Prof. Trinks expects to make a test 
very soon. The machine is designed 
for grinding blocks to perfect form so 
that accurate measurements may be 
made. The Civil Engineering de
partment will use the machine to de
termine. the wearing qualities of 
stone, brick and paving materials, in 
place of the sand blast which has 
been used for this purpose, but which 
does not give entirely natural con
ditions.-------o------
THE SHEET METAL WORKER 
APPRENTICE CLASS
Was permanently organized Mon
day evening, Feb. 18, and the follow
ing officers were elected: Mr. Schoeller, president; Mr. Stratmeier, vice 
president; Mr. Riddle, secretarytreasurer; Mr. Weixtel, historian.
It was suggested that it would be 
a good plan to take steps toward or
ganizing a base-ball nine, but noth
ing was definitely settled until the 
attitude of the other night classes 
could be ascertained. A motion was 
made that the money collected on 
the first monthly assessment be in
vested in a small pie and coifee ban
quet at the schools epicurean roost; 
but it was overruled. A constitution 
was adopted unanimously amid wild 
excitement. A motion was made and 
carried that an invitation be extend
ed to the students of the cooking 
class at the Margaret Morrison Car
negie school for Women, provided 
they bring eatables for 15 carniverous 
tinkers. The meeting was brought 
to a close by Bro. Snowball render
ing the Alma Mater song.

1911
Mr. Howard, he of math, fame, is 
certainly one to be congratulated. 
He tried with remarkable (though 
characteristic) success, to revive a 
dying fire with a quart of gasoline. 
The incident is reported by an eye
witness to the little comedy-drama. 
While grateful for the item as a bit 
of news, yet it would have been 
more charitable to keep it quiet, Mac.
We suppose everybody has placed 
his order for The Thistle. It will 
be a good investment, as it will be a 
complete history of the year with 
pictures of all the teams and various 
clubs, prominent in school life. This 
appeal is made directly to 1911 by a 
1911 man, in the hope that 1911 will 
make a good record in this matter 
as she has done in others.
19il regrets to report the loss of 
two students, both of section C-l. They 
are the Messrs. Lightcap and Orr, and 
were considered among the foremost 
of the intellectual lights of their sec
tion. The great demand for night 
work at their respective positions is 
given as the cause of their with
drawal.
Harley bet a M. M. C. S. student a 
Tartan on a little matter. One soli
tary, measly, stingy, trifling, meagre 
issue. Why not make it a years sub
scription, or is plunging against 
your principles?
Poetry, poetry everywhere, but 
nary a line thats fit to print. This 
was the condition of affairs of last 
weeks issue.
1911 has a class meeting scheduled 
for March 11. As this notice is of a 
length sufficient to ante-date any 
other engagement, the class officers 
will assume that any absence is a 
willful act of disloyalty and indif
ference.
One of the members of that recent 
sleighing party complained that his 
girls name did not appear in the 
write-up. Your pardon and hers too, 
Kirk, for the omission.
Instead of saying the disagreeable 
odor of sulphide of hydrogen, or 
the odoriferous compound known 
scientifically as hydrogen sulphide, 
or the nauseating effluvia arising 
from sulphuretted hydrogen, some
body exclaimed, Whew! What a 
stink i
An anonymous suggestion was re
ceived by a member of the 1911 so
cial committee, which certainly has 
an abundance of originality in it. 
The plan calls for a Bohemian 
theater party to take place in the 
second balcony, (better known as 
peanut heaven) at one of the pop
ular priced play houses. After the 
performance the party is to adjourn 
to a beanery, where high revels 
are to be indulged in until the party 
be ejected by the proprietor.
The Bohemian idea of the sugges
tion is all right, but is scarcely in 
keeping with the dignity of our school 
nor of the class, and on these grounds 
was passed up.
Say, fellows, Howard got a hair
cut.

NOTES.
A working set of rules for the guid
ance of the students of the schools 
will be distributed this week.
Mr. John Shoestrings has been lo
cated through the agency of the Tar
tan, which has the largest circulation 
of any paper in the Technical schools.
Miss Blanche --------- arrived at the
sehqpls last Saturday morning in a 
large automobile. It is reported that 
she intends to sojourn 'in Europe this 
summer. ,
I wonder how a Beatrice Fairfax 
column, with advice to the lovelorn, 
would go in the Tartan?
The Dramatic Club held their first 
regular meeting on Tuesday night, 
Feb. 26. All interested are requested 
to attend our next.
There is a Schwartz type of brass 
furnace being installed in the foun
dry.
In a short time we can expect to 
see a small Bessemer Converter and 
a 24-inch Rumbling Mill in the foun
dry.
The Department of Electricity has 
received a complete outfit of Nernst 
lamps, with extra parts of same, and 
an outfit for determining the color 
values of different types of incandes
cent lamps. These are the gift of 
the Nernst Lamp Co. 
The storage batteries installed in 
the Chemical Laboratory by the Elec
trical students are ready for charging.
The Laboratory organ is fast near
ing completion and will be installed 
in the Physics Laboratory about 
April 1st. The new magnet winder, 
designed by Mr. Graman, is a com
plete success.
Mr. W. B. Doyle, A.B., M.A., LL.B., 
has been appointed instructor in the 
Department of English. Mr. Doyle 
is a graduate of Amherst, 95,. and 
later attended the law department

practiced law at Akron, Ohio, for 
some time.
The New England Club will hold a 
theater party and banquet during the
coming week. There are to date three 
members.
Plebes! get after your representa
tives and demand more notice in the 
Tartan columns.
David Grafton (Doodles), 09, has 
received the appointment from this 
district to the U. S. Naval Academy 
at Anapolis. The men were all pleased 
to hear of his success but sorry to 
lose a good fellow and a good guard 
on the foot-ball team.
The Track Team candidates had 
their photos, taken last Tuesday in 
running suits. There were shapes of 
the positive, comparative and super
lative order.
The Tartan staff picture was taken 
last Sunday.
The students may get their grades 
at the Registrars office this week.
The Thistle will be ready about 
March 25. Dont forget to place your

The C. E. Society held its regular 
monthly meeting last Thursday even
ing in the Civil Department. After 
the business of the evening was 
transacted the society enjoyed a very 
interesting and practical talk by Mr. 
Reed on the subject of Clearance 
necessary in railway tiiack construc
tion. Mr. Reed brought out the 
point that although it involves no
French, going by a plumbing shop, 
saw this sign: Cast Iron Sinks, and 
French said: I always knew that. 
The above joke was submitted for 
publication. George Ade once said: 
The difference betwreen a turkey and 
a man is that they dont stuff a 
turkey with chestnuts until after it is 
dead.

yond their scope to give students suf
ficient data on every phase of en
gineering. The object of schools is 
to teach methods of attacking prob
lems and to fix a few (but very few) 
of the important constants in the stu
dents head, which are to aid in the 
solution of every-day problems. It is 
not the place of the colleges to dic
tate to their students pages upon 
pages of co-efficients and constants; 
neither must students expect to get 
their information from the schools 
in printed, lithographed or mimeo
graphed sheets. I never saw an en
gineer use his college notes for ref
erence and I am convinced that very 
few ever do. As a rule the college 
note books are at the bottom of a 
mans trunk, never to be used except 
in special emergencies, because they 
are too voluminous and unhandy for 
quick reference. Besides, they are 
obsolete in part. Engineering data 
are continually corrected and meth
ods change so rapidly that it takes 
only a few years "for data to be oi^t 
of date. New inventions and dis
coveries are made which were not 
thought of when the engineer in 
question went to school.
Engineering text books are regu
larly three to four years 01* more be
hind times and besides expensive; 
they take up space, are heavy and
are a general nuisance, when a man 
is moving about the country. Enrgineering magazines are up to date, 
but none have text books with regard 
to volume, weight and expense.
What is wanted is a reference book 
full of reliable data; it should also 
contain the formula and methods 
taught in colleges in a nutshell, very 
briefly, but enough to bring the whole 
theory and evolution back to the man 
who did his duty when in college. 
The demand for such a reference book 
is great, but it will pay no one man to 
undertake the task of making it.
Engineering societies could make 
an excellent reference booK if they 
properly organized and had paid of
ficers to look after the work; with the 
present system of unpaid officers 
(honorary burdens) nothing can be 
expected. Besides we have no gen
eral engineering society throughout 
the country. The societies are either 
chemical, civil, electrical, mechan
ical, railroaders, etc., and it would be 
asking too much to expect conceited 
action from them.
In my opinion the only way to ever 
get a good American reference book 
consists in copying the methods of 
the Charlottenburg students.
The Carnegie Technical Schools 
are situated close to one of the most 
complete reference libraries in the 
country. They are located in one of 
the worlds industrial centers. They 
cater to the class of students who are 
iot afraid to work. They have a 
faculty of practical men, and, last but 
not least, an equipment which per
mits one to obtain data on almost any 
subject.
For these reasons I believe that 
our students can produce the right 
kind of reference books. With our 
constantly increasing number of stu
dents the share of work for each
would be very small and still we could 
make a book which would beat all 
others to a standstill.
I should welcome the formation of 
a reference society among the stu
dents of the school of Applied Sci
ence. Such a society and its product, 
the reference book, would raise the 
rank of the school and of its gradu
ates to a much higher level than any 
glee club concerts or foot-ball vic
tories or debating clubs or class ban
quets can ever do.
If this paper will stir up discussion 
and will finally lead to the formation 
of a reference society, I shall feel 
happy; first, because 1 am sufficiently 
Americanized to deplore the fact that 
all engineering offices use a German 
'reference book; second, because I 
like to see our school accomplish 
something which no other school in 
the country ha accomplished.
From the moment of the organiza
tion of such a society to the first edi
tion of a. reference book will take at 
least three years. Anything com
pleted in much less time will bear the 
ear marks of the-forethought-comerafterwards affair.
If a sufficient number of students 
can be found to start this work, I 
shall be glad to assist them to the 
best of my limited ability.

that it will be rather lonesome in our 
new school. I wonder what they can 
mean!
When the cats away the mice 
will play. This was well proven a 
few days ago in study hour in the 
absence of the teacher. Four girls 
were locked in the store room cup
board and kept there till they were 
quite subdued. The class stood out
side and while encouraging them to 
keep up their spirits, tied the door 
shut. After a long time had elapsed 
they were given their freedom none 
the worse for their captivity.
On Thursday the geography class 
held a debate, the question being, 
Resolved, that the Panama Canal 
will increase the commerce of San 
Francisco. The argument was bit
terly contested and both sides put 
up a hard fight. The debate closed 
with judges decision in favor of the 
affirmative.
Next week another debate, Re
solved, that the United States can 
exist and prosper without the aid of 
the other countries of the world, is 
to be held and promises some very 
interesting arguments.
