IWO DEFATS FOR 
BASE BALL TEAM
agdoBnB Bdd Hedd SnBne BJnh .efeBn 
^he HLBodWhile on what turned out to be a 
most disastrous week-end the base 
ball team journeyed to Juniata where 
on Friday, they opposed Juniata Col
lege. Saturday they lost to Penn 
Sta.e at Siate College. In spite of 
.he fact that we lost both games, our 
icllows played their very best but 
against better teams.
i he game with Juniata is the sec
ond one of the season. Carnegie had 
prewously lost the first game of the 
. ca^on to Juniata, 9 to 6. The score 
of i'ridays game was 9 to 3.
Both teams did quite a little swat
ting as can be seen by the box score. 
Dariiugton was on the mound for 
Carnegie until he was supplanted by 
Yv can in the fifth. But neither one 
could check the Juniata batsmen, 
icwsonger, the home team pitcher, 
shared almost the same fate. The 
plaid nine were credited with ten hits 
and of these, two are credited to 
^ap.ani Humphreys who seemed to 
ue in his element. One of his drives 
\.as a home run while the other was 
a single through short. In^addition 
lie played an excellent game and had 
eleven put-outs. McClure also 
pounded out three singles and aside 
from his hitting played a good fielding 
game. Rondabush led Juniatas slug
gers with three hits, while Blair, Big
ler and Corbin had two apiece. The 
game was well played and interesting 
to watch on account of the heavy hit
ting.
The Penn-State game was another 
one which was filled with long drives 
and heavy slugging. Here again Cap
tain Humphreys came to the front and 
pounded out a home run with Lain 
and Kreider on base. In the sixth he 
drove out a three-bagger over the 
left field fence bringing in Lain.
In spite of their large score, PennState only received seven hits from 
Hines. But these were well bunched 
and effective in run producing. I he 
game was even closer than that with 
Juniata and until the seventh inning 
might easily have been anybodys.
Penn-State started out with two in 
the first and one in the second and 
third. But Humphreys home run 
With three on bases in the fourth and 
I ain tied the score in the sixth. But 
Penn-State came back in the last two 
innings and batted in four runs in 
each inning, winning 12 to 4.
The team received excellent treatIJdnodged Jd HBge 5
ANNUAL INiERS(HOLASTI( MEET
THE LARGESI AND BEST YET HEED
^eth Bdd ALLeghedr ^oeThe largest interscholastic meet 
ever held in Pittsburgh was run off 
last Saturday in conjunction with the 
Tech-Allegheny dual at Schenley 
Oval, under the auspices of this In
stitution .before a crowd which filled 
the grandstand and lined the fence 
inside the track. It was an almost 
penect day for a track meet, Lhe only 
drawback being the steady breeze 
which blew from the west. The track 
was firm and fast, having been weil 
watered by the rain the previous 
evening.
Several hundred scholastic athletes 
from Pittsburgh and neighboring cit
ies competed for the medals and cup 
provided by the Athletic Association. 
Kiski had a full complement of ath
letes present as did Johnston and 
Greensburg High Schools. All the 
high schools of Pittsburgh and the 
suburbs were represented by their 
teams.
But it remained for a team of four 
men from Shaw High School of East 
Cleveland to walk away with the hon
ors of the day. Each man a star they 
managed to secure a majority of the 
places in almost every race, totaling 
29, with their nearest competitor, 
Peabody High School, securing 16 2-7. 
Greensburg and McKeesport, the star 
teams of last year finished low in the 
scoring as did Wilkinsburg, another 
team picked to finish near the top.
The result of the Tech-Allegheny 
dual were undecided until the last 
event, the broad jump where McKay 
of Allegheny outdistanced Breman of 
Tech and tied the score of the meet 
63-63. It looked like a sure thing 
for our track team early in the day, 
Tech pulling way ahead in the sprints 
and distance runs. In the hurdles 
and shot put brought the blue and 
gold up from the rear. Tech took 
eight firsts, five seconds and one 
tie for second, and six thirds. Alle
gheny secured six firsts, eight sec
onds and one tie for second, and eight 
thirds.
Fahr was Alleghenys individual 
star. He finished first in three 
events, the 120-yard hurdles, the 440- 
yard dash and the 220-yard hurdles. 
McKay ran second for Alleghenys 
individual honors, with first place in 
the broad and high jumps.
Adams was Techs chief point 
scorer. He took first place in the 
discus and hammer throws and sec

tied with 10 points. The formers vic
tories were attained in the half-mile 
and mile runs, while the latter ruled 
the field in the 100 and 220-yard 
dashes.
Reiser was pushed all the way by 
Ling of Allegheny in the one-mile 
collegiate run, but managed to finish 
about seven yards ahead by spurting 
at the end. He also was given hard 
opposition in the half-mile run, which 
he won in 2 minutes 4 seconds. Ellis 
of Allegheny followed him in and Mc
Kinney, also of Allegheny, was a 
good third. The latter collapsed as 
he crossed the finish line and had to 
be assisted from the field.
Tech took all three places in the 
two-mile run, Curtis of Allegheny 
dropping out. Walker finished close 
behind Dockstader, who needlessly 
tired himself as he was also entered 
in the mile. In the 440 McCracken 
of Tech finished strong, passing an 
Allegheny man just at the tape.
The feature of the interscholastic 
meet was the performance of the four 
athletes from Shaw High School. 
Walker Gay, Kenny Smith, Louis 
Corly and Harold Green comprised 
the team, coached by F. C. Oeffinger. 
These four started off to capture the 
meet in the first event and ended by 
winning first and fourth in the 120- 
yard hurdles, first and second in the 
220 hurdles, first and second in the 
100-yard dash, second in the 880, sec
ond in the mile and fourth in the 
broad jump. Green scored nine. 
Smith eight and Cody and Gay six 
points each.
One of the most thrilling events of 
the day was staged by the interschol
astics when in the 880 yard run, Hill 
of Monongahela High scored a vic
tory by the narrowest of margins 
over Cody of Shaw High. The latter 
made a terrific spurt when nearing the 
tape with Hill in the lead, and when 
the finish line was reached, there was 
barely one foot separating the lads.
Another exciting finish was wit
nessed in the final heat in the 220 
yard dash for scholastics. In this race, 
Stewart of Peabody High, Mayer of 
Edgewood High, Doty of Kiski Prep 
and Schumaker of Peabody High 
were bunched so close for four-fifths 
of the distance that it looked like a 
hopeless task for the judges to atIJdnodged Jd HBge 3
During the past few days the as
piring and future engineers of the 
Science School, as well as the cas
ual observers of other departments, 
have observed with interest the prac
tical application of modern engineer 
ing work going on before us in the 
construction of the new, not only 
new, but only Bureau of Mines in 
the United States.
The various processes of excavat
ing have been the cause of much 
speculation and inquiry not only to 
our very practical purposes of en
gineering knowledge, but even to our 
highly imaginative architects.
The actual process of preparing the 
way for the building, of the Bureau 
of Mines, is now progressing rap
idly. As the government will not 
allow more than an eight-hour work
ing day, there are two shifts work
ing continuously including Sundays. 
Each gang is composed of about 150 
laborers. The amount of earth to be 
removed is considerable, and in or
der to facilitate the carrying away 
of this quantity of earth two loco
motives are kept busy continuously. 
The No. 60 Excavator has a capacity 
of about two and one-half cubic 
yards of earth per bucketfull. Some 
of the slag and rock on the side of 
the hill have necessitated consider
able blasting to prepare the way for 
the axcavator. The entire hill from 
the valley to Forbes street is to be 
removed, the deepest cut at any on 
place being about 25 feet deep, which 
cut will be from a level 25 feet above 
the present excavating level. The 
power house and that part of the 
building for heavy machinery will be 
placed on that level which is now 
being built up.
According to Mr. Riffle, who is 
the contractor of the excavating 
work, about 80,000 to 90,000 cubic 
yards of earth will have to be re
moved preparatory to the erection of 
the building. The approximate cost 
of this excavating done will be about 
$30,000. About 900 cubic yards can 
be removed by a shift working eight 
hours. To complete the excavating 
at the present rate about 25 to 30 
days will be required. The actual 
construction of the buildings can be 
completed in about twenty months. 
To it will be about two years before 
the building will be entirely com
pleted.

FMA^EMNA^Y NEWSIt is due time that the fraternities 
of Carnegie throw aside the veil of 
secrecy and get better acquainted 
with each other and school life. The 
non-fraternity man may well gasp and 
stare at these brotherly organizations 
and conclude that their benefits are 
neither for him nor the school.
Just what happens in and around 
the several fraternities houses where 
some of the picked men of the school 
congregate is shrouded with mystery. 
Secrecy makes an organization either 
feared and revered or derided and 
disliked.
In other college papers the frater
nities publish a list of pledges. There 
is hardly a college paper now that 
comes through our exchange list that 
does not have a fraternity news col
umn. They publish the social affairs 
of each and bring the organization in 
close touch with other men of the 
school. Why not do the same in 
The Tartan?
Perhaps it is this continual dwel
ling in darkness which makes us feel 
that our fraternities are not doing 
what they should for the upbuilding 
of our fast growing institution.
Now we have a chance to remedy 
the above impressions of the out
sider. The Tartan will set aside a 
column or so for the exclusive use of 
fraternities. Give us your support, 
announce and give accounts of your 
fraternity dances, smokers, teas, house 
parties and picnics. Show the stu
dent body you are a part of and in
terested in Carnegie.
All such news must be in the hands 
of the editor only, by the Monday 
morning preceding the issue of that 
week.
^HE QUALA^Y OF CEMIYTo every American citizen one fact 
must stand out clear and before all 
others since the sinking of the Lusi
tania. In defiance, not alone of the 
bond of international law, but of every 
dictate of common humanity; Amer
ican men, women and children; citi
zens of a neutral nation; have been 
exposed to deathprobably actually 
murdered by a German war craft.
The vessel on which they sailed 
was fair prize for the German naval 
forces. German sea-power was en
titled to capture the Lusitania if 
they could, to sink her if necessity 
demanded; but NOT until every noncombatant was safely taken from her 
decks, not until the safety of every 
neutral life have been assured.
Morally, the sinking of the Lusi
tania was no worse than the sinking 
of the Falaba. In each considera
tion a passenger ship, carrying neu
trals and non-combatants, was de
stroyed by a German submarine and 
hundreds of men, women and children 
left to survive or drown as chance 
decreed. The destruction of the Lusi
tania makes a more dramatic appeal 
to the human imagination than did the 
destruction of the Falaba, but both 
are crimes against civilization in an 
equal degree. Does murder become 
more innocent because the victim has 
been warned in advance that a death 
blow would be struck if he persisted 
in the exercise of his lawful rights?
In consideration of this frightful 
episode of war waged with unparalled 
or unabated ruthlessness and barbar
ity, it is foolishly idle to take into 
consideration the technicalities or 
niceties of international law. It will 
be futile to give audience to the bitter 
charges which will probably at once 
rise from the lips of the Allies, and 
it will be equally useless to listen to 
the defense that will undoubtedly be 
made by German power. Considera
tion of the laws of war vanish in the 
face of so great a catastrophe which, 
in all God-fearing minds, violates the 
laws of Mercy and Common Human
ity. G. A. C.
ALUCNA NEWSThe Tartan lacks sufficient alum
ni news and the means of securing 
the same. Although such is covered 
by the C. I. T. Alumnus, there is no 
reason why the student body and 
alumni subscribers should not know 
what, where and how our various 
graduates are doing. Any sugges
tions from anyone how this neglect 
can be remedied and news of suffi
cient importance secured will be 
gratefully received. If any, the alum
ni are willing to take this upon them
selves. Kindly advise the editor of 
the same.

We shall certainly welcome the

be said, concerning the widespread 
benefit of this enterprise, not only to 
the mining industry and other allied 
industries, but for the conservation 
of our natural resources and the pro

Everybody has heard about the con
test between Tech and Pitt being con
ducted by the Liggett and Myers To
bacco Company. The student re
ceiving the highest number of votes 
receives a motorcycle. The college 
in which the winner is registered re
ceives one-half cent for every coupon 
cast, this money going to the Athletic 
Association.
A similar contest was held last year 
at Ohio State and the Athletic Asso
ciation received between $3,000 and 
$4,000. This amount should be. sur
passed as there are two colleges in 
this contest instead of one.
At present there are twelve contest
ants for Pitt. This should help Tech 
in winning the contest as Louis Sand
ler is the only man competing for 
this institution. He has lived in Pitts
burgh all his life and his numerous 
friends in this city are all materially 
pulling for his success. He is also 
connected with the tobacco business 
and receives a great quantity of help 
from this source.
The chances for Mr. Sandler win
ning are good. It is up to every Tech 
man to help him win. The votes from 
across the way are divided between 
twelve contestants, so that our men 
should have no difficulty in winning 
A gift of a couple of thousand would 
help the Athletic Association mater
ially and we would also have the 
gratification of slipping something 
over on Pitt. Let every Tech man 
remember Save your coupons and 
box fronts and vote only for Louis 
Sandler. Pass the word along.
CMS- KELLY A^ .ESAGN 
^HEA^MEOne of the most prominent women 
in the United States was in our midst 
last Thursday when Mrs. Florence 
Kelly addressed the members and 
friends of the C. I. T. Economic So
ciety at the Design Theatre. Mrs. 
Kelly spoke on Child Labor. She 
certainly is thoroughly familiar with 
the subject, having been identified 
with child labor agitation and legis
lation since 1882.
The speaker cited many instances 
of how child labor laws are evaded 
by unscrupulous owners and operat
ors of many factories. In Vermont, 
for instance, a law existed whereby 
children were legally permitted to 
work in sheds, but not in factories. 
By simply painting the word shed 
over the entrances to their factories, 
the law was complied with.
After her address, Mrs. Kelly of
fered to answer questions. An ani
mated discussion followed, Dr. Esquerre leading in the number of ques
tions asked.
SHOM^ANG IOCCEN^SThat the Allegheny meet was not 
won by four points by us was due to 
the failure of some of the entries to 
show up. We had only one man com
peting in the hammer and Allegheny 
took third with a heave of only 67 
feet. Third in the shot put should 
also have been ours.
The Shaw High School team was 
put up at the training house over 
Friday and Saturday nights. Satur
day evening the boys were taken out 
and shown the town by a few of our 
track men. Training rules were en
forced.
The baseball management reports 
excellent treatment received at State. 
There was no attempt to bother our 
players from the stands and on the 
contrary much applause was in evi
dence, especially when Humphreys 
came up after his drive in the fourth.
Two more birthdays were cele
brated at the training house. Coach 
Dull and Mitchell each receiving the 
usual cake and pink candles.
Rieser came near being prevented 
from running in the meet Saturday. 
An irate classmate heaved a breaker 
or ice at his face cutting him badly. 
Techs chances would have gone glim
mering had the result been more ser
ious. Some people do not possess the 
faculty of thinking before they act.
There will be some pretty contests 
at Forbes Field next Saturday, espe
cially in the dashes. W. & J. was 
swamped by Pitt at the oval Friday.
Syracuse and Michigan are here in 
tennis next Tuesday and Wednesday. 
Some fine tennis should be displayed.

tempt to pick the winner. When 
within but a few yards of the finish, 
however, Stewart managed to gain 
a slight lead and flash over a winner. 
Mayer was second, Doty third and 
Schumaker fourth.
The one-mile scholastic relay race 
brought every spectator to his feet. 
In this event were pitted Greensburg, 
South, Fifth Ave., Central, Peabody, 
Wilkinsburg, Johnstown and McKees
port High schools and Kiski Prep, 
each school boasting of a well trained 
and speedy team. In the last half 
mile of this affair were pitted Barnett 
of Peabody, Allen, Central Highs 
color star, Lucas of Wilkinsburg 
High, and Henderson of Kiski. On 
the final stretch these runners were 
within a few feet of each other and 
each made a magnificent sprint, Bar
nett winning at the finish by inches.
In both the mile and 880, Hill of 
Monongahela High and Cody fought 
for first place and finished within a 
foot of each other. In both races 
Cody made a terrific sprint but 
couldnt quite pass the star from up 
the river. All four point winners 
were well bunched in the mile.
Spear of Shadyside took two firsts, 
the 440-yard dash and the broad 
jump.
Much credit is due to Manager 
Overdorf for the success of the meet, 
the most successful, in fact, ever con
ducted by Tech. For the first time 
the medals and cup were on hand and 
delivered to the winners after the 
events. Everything went off like clock 
work and the manager is to be con
gratulated.

aUNAOM ILASS ^O GAE HLAYAt a class meeting held last Wed
nesday, the Juniors voted to support 
the Dramatic Club in a play to be 
given Saturday, May 22nd. Several 
times during the year the Dramatic 
Club has tried to produce a play, but 
lack of time and interest on the part 
of the girls prevented. So it is now 
that the officers of the club are espe
cially pleased at the active interest 
taken by the Juniors even at this late 
date. The play to be given is a 
masque, The Woods of Ida written 
by Mrs. Dargan. The girls intend if 
the weather permits to give it out in 
the open. No admission will be 
charged and it is hoped a large num
ber will attend.
^HE .OMC- .ANIEFriday evening, May 7th, the Morewood Avenue Dormitory was arrayed 
in gala dress in honor of the last 
dance of the school year. The danc
ing lasted until one oclock and 
every one was unanimous in saying 
that it was very successful.
Miss Collingwood and Dr. Esquerre 
were chaperones. Miss Georgia Clark, 
chairman of the program committee, 
and Miss Agnes Wright, chairman of 
the refreshment committee, are both 
to be complimented upon the success 
with which their plans were carried 
out.
HENN S^A^E WANS^Bkes ^eddos CBnth, 5 nJ 1-
Displaying what will probably be 
the best tennis seen here this year, 
the Penn State tennis team overcame 
the Plaid racquet men 5 to 1, on 
Carnegies courts last Thursday. The 
matches all went in favor of State 
except that of Steen, Tech, and 
Smedley, State. These two fought 
it out for almost an hour and a half, 
both men resorting to a slow form 
of game. Before the match was over 
many long distance games had been 
played. Steen resorted a good bit to 
lobbing. The first set went to Steen, 
6 to 4. Smedley then came to the 
front and took one, 6 to 3. The two 
men had it out in the last set and 
Steen ended the winner, 6 to 3.
Jones and Bihlman seemed to be 
very evenly matched and played two 
deuce sets, the State player winning 
over Bihlman 7 to 5 and 8 to 6. The 
match was the fastest played and 
both men showed up well. The Plaid 
racqueter pulled himself out of bad 
holes by brilliant playing and man
aged to force the State man to his 
utmost.
Nevin, of State, defeated English, 
of Tech, 6 to 2, and 6 to 4. The visi
tor took the first set with ease. How
ever, English took a brace in the last 
set and made things a little more dif
ficult.
Davis, of Tech, lost to McCance, 
of State, 6 to 1 and 6 to 3. McCance 
had an excellent serve, which kept 
Davis guessing, but the Plaid man
made him fight his hardest for every 
point. The match turned out to be 
fast and most interesting.
In the doubles, Bihlman and Eng
lish, of Carnegie, were defeated 6 to
4 and 6 to 3, by Nevin and Jones, of 
State. Bihlmans deficiency was his 
serving, but aside from this he did 
very good work. English seemed 
much better than he did in the sin
gles and put up a beautiful game. 
But Nevin and Jones had a shade 
the better of Carnegies men and 
played wonderful tennis.
In the second set of doubles, Mc
Cance and Smedley were forced to 
their limit to win, 6-3 and 6-2, from 
Steen and Davis, of Tech. Both 
Steen and Smedley used faster meth
ods of attack than they did in their 
singles, which added greatly to the 
interest.

SA^UM.AYThe annual dual track meet be
tween Pitt and Tech will be staged 
at 1:30 oclock on Forbes Field, Satudray afternoon, prior to the Penn
S tate-Pitt baseball game. A half rate admission fee of twentyfive cents with the student athletic 
association tickets will be charged. 
The three weight events will be run 
off tomorrow afternoon on Tech 
Field at 3:30 oclock to avoid tear
ing up the turf of the Pirates ball 
grounds.
The Blue and Gold won last years 
meet by the close margin of 5 1-5 
points, the result being in doubt until 
the final event. Saturdays contest 
promises a repetition of that struggle. 
Pitts greatest advantage lies in the 
weight events in which Adams for 
Tech will be pitted against Suther
land, Collins and Fry. The sprints 
should offer an exciting tussle be
tween Hemmann and Burwell. The 
latter won three first places in the 
Pitt-W. & a- meet a week ago, but 
with keener competition, he is un
likely to repeat that performance. If 
he is not entered in the 440-yard dash, 
Dunseith should win that event. Ac
cording to last weeks results, Rieser 
is the favorite in the half-mile, with 
the odds about even in the other two 
distance runs. The hurdle races will 
give Blumenthal and Meredith a
good opportunity to increase the
Plaid score, for Fry, of Pitt, should 
be their only dangerous rival. The 
jumps will be another big asset for 
the Blue and Gold, while in the pole 
vault, McMasters and Wright will
probably start their Alfonso and Gas
ton act for the season.
If we were asked our opinion of 
the outcome of the meet, we should 
advise every student to find out for 
himself. Save the above predictions 
and compare them with actual re
sults. At any rate, dont fail to at
tend both Fridays and Saturdays 
events. We assure you it will be 
worth your while.

APPLIED INDUSTRIES
CA..LES .OUBLE AI^OMSThursday the faculty, and Saturday 
the upper men, speaks well for the 
middle mens base ball ability. The 
faculty game helped the victors to 
get on edge for the upper contest and 
the practice gained Thursday went B 
long way toward sending their ag
gressors on the vtnlucky route to the 
tune of 10 to S.
Athlete Lawlor served the full 
game and with the splendid support 
given him by his team mates man
aged to hold the hard-hitting uppers 
to five lucky runs. Vernon did the 
box work for the graduating class but 
lack of support helped his downfall.
Williams sent in the only homer 
which, with several men on base, 
helped turn the tables early in the 
sixth. The game was full of fed 
stuff, bones being pulled off on both 
sides.

ErrorsProlific. UmpireSkinnem. Time4 hours. Scorekeeper 
Red Lawd.
We still think the faculty are in 
need of more practice. With all due 
credit to their willingness, it seems 
too harsh not to let them win even 
one game.
Heres an original one, overheard 
at the Middle-Upper game, just as 
the Saturday morn whistles were 
blowing:
XSee if those whistles are on 
time, Herr Dosey.
Herr D.My Ingersoll measures 
six minutes after. Must be its fast.
X.Maybe it takes that long for 
the sound to reach us. Exit X.
Just a word of thanks to the many 
ushers who were on hand inspection 
night. From comments, they did 
their part well. Some of us have al
ready had dates.
Speaking of Inspection, the various 
shop instructors had their hands full. 
We can still see that auto (?) in the 
machine shop refusing to start, under 
the head instructors efforts. Soft 
pedals on the interior vocabulary. 
Not only that, an hour before the 
opening, the pattern shop was all 
decked out like an Easter bonnet and 
what should happen but. several out
side students come in and gave the 
P. S. floor the appearance of having 
been through the European War with 
shavings as ammunition. That meant 
another half hours job cleaning up 
the floor and a half minutes Jiu Jitsu 
cleaning out the over-ambitious stu
dents.
The Hip-Sing Tong and the OnLeong tong were at their best in the 
forge shop.
Going back two weeks we cant for
get the last edition of the Bagpipe. 
The contents were most satisfying to 
say nothing of the cover, all of which 
reminds us that as yet we do not have 
the Hamerschlag trophy which we 
won some time ago. The athletic 
committee again is notified to get on 
the jump. The assembly president 
ought to push this along also.
Mr. Boechter delivered a stirring 
address in 104 recently, probably the 
best ever heard by the student body. 
His talk was a general one and cov
ered the advantages of properly ap
plying an education, the spirit of 
brotherly love, and kindred subjects. 
The storm of applause following his 
words indicated the feeling of admira
tion he had gained throughout the lec
ture.
As yet nothing has been done about 
the Carnegie Letter Day. Heres an
other topic of such importance that 
this column intends to dwell upon 
weekly until definite action is taken 
by the Student Assembly.
Just how many of us know the ad
vantages which may be derived from 
spending an hour in the Carnegie Un
ion. Of course, we dont mean a class 
hour.

DESIGN SCHOOL NOTES
BAIIHANALAAN MEELA spirit of keen anticipation has 
been the governing atmosphere about 
the Design School while unique plans 
have been thoughtfully laid for the 
Greek Revel upon the evening of 
May 13th. The spirit of the even
ings brightness will be introduced by 
a Masque written by Mr. T. A. Viehman of the Department of Dramatic 
Arts, and produced under the person
al direction of Mr. Thomas Wood 
Stevens. Special plans have been for
mulated with the desire to produce 
an effect inside the Design School 
corridors which will be used in a 
decorative way flanking the white 
stone of the mellow moonlight effect. 
Dancing and refreshments will fol
low.
A large poster hangs above the 
main entrance of the Design School 
as an announcement of the Greek 
Revel. Mr. Forest Crooks and Mr. 
W. A. Readio have been presented 
a pleasing effect which is so well bal
anced by appropriateness that they 
cic-servf a special word of apprecia
tion.
^HE HLAYS ^HE ^HANGA comparatively easy task, this dis
posing of scene-painting, light effects 
and the like, but here the reviewer 
takes his life in his hands and trem
bles at the Herculean task confront
ing his audacity. Fools rush in 
where angels fear to treadhowever, 
taking courage he begins, where there 
is small chance for disagreement, with 
Charles Frederick Steen, who has to 
his credit a more varied repertoire 
than any other student in this de
partment. He read his lines well from 
the first as all, who recall his Proteus, 
will attest. He lost his conscious
ness of make-up early, as shown 
by his freer play of facial expression 
in Giles in The Dancing Dolls, 
this being only his second role and 
a general improvement in all direc
tions has been noticeable throughout 
the year. His voice has a plaintive, 
w insome quality which lends a charm 
to certain characters and nowhere did 
this serve him so well as in Bernard 
Shaws William, that master-study 
of a servant whose instinct is finer 
than that of the people he serves.
Mr. Steens Orestes was most ac
ceptable, well read and not over-act
ed, which may also be said of his 
Pan in the Masque. Here again 
his voice became a valuable asset 
for is not this Pan querulous over past 
joys and plaintive in his appeal to the 
woodnymphs for the pleasures of the 
dance?
But his Dogberry was the surprise 
par excellence. Here he sank his per
sonality completely and let go his re
serve. He simply wallowed in Dogberryism the last night and who could 
blame himthe house encouraged it 
they wanted all he could give them 
and they got it. Really, that Dog
berry ensemble should go down, in 
the log-book of the Department of
Drama, as the most sublimely ridicu.lous thing they have given the pub
lic. The role was handled with more 
discretion in the previous perform
ance, but with less satisfaction to the 
assembled students, as the applause 
attested.
For general artistic excellence Mr. 
Steen reached the high-water mark 
in his interpretation of that tactful 
servitor, William, in You Never Can 
Tell.
The most obvious fact in regard to 
Mr. Steens work is its sincerityhe 
is in earnest whether he is beating up 
a hickory stick and proclaiming him
self an ass, or facing a mysterious 
death before the altar of Artenus.
Here is an opportunity to mention 
some excellent character acting and 
bits of good work here and there 
through the year
The dancing of Miss Marion Wil
liams in the Chaplet of Pan attractcd favorable comment. She is the 
type most readily metamorphosed 
into a wood-nymph and had a certain 
shrinking elusiveness which is al
ways charming. Miss Mary Reznor, 
to whom was entrusted the solo work 
upon this occasion, was well received 
and recalled at each performance.
John W. Burkes Petre and Miss 
Betty Duffys Inez in The Neigh
bors were interpreted with a natural
ness and simplicity that was refresh
ing. Miss Inez Krebs, with her Buf
falo Bug, was one of the high lights 
in this play. She succeeded in get
ting a great deal out of a very small 
partproving her ability for bigger 
things. Her Princess in The Kings 
Threshold  was another piece of 
small work well done and it is well 
to remember that it is small things 
well done that lead to the highway 
of success.

their second game in the inter-class 
series and easily won over the Plebes,

early innings and up to the seventh 
was anybodys game. But Pitcher

hold the Sophs, in the Seventh and 
they hammered in five runs. The 
Plebes had trouble with their batter
ies and made three changes. The fea
ture play of the game was a triple 
play in the third inning when McAleer of the Plebes caught a fly from 
Jacobson, touched second, catching 
Black off the bag, and threw to Lundell. who caught Rowe out off first base.

The C. I. T. Economic Society con
siders it a privilege to announce to 
the students of C. I. T. that Mrs. 
Gertrude Breslau Fuller will speak on 
Wednesday, May 19th, at the M. M. 
C. S. assembly room, 3:30 H- M., on 
a subject of most vital interest.
Mrs. Fullers lectures deal with the 
burning and imperious problems 
which we face as a society. She is a 
woman whose face is to the sunrise, 
who works through the night and 
sings of the dawn; she is touched 
with the divine fire of the orator who

to Carnegie Tech, the cars to be

I. E. E. dinner, according to an un
authorized interview with President 
Gumbart, of the Mho Club. The spe
cial war correspondent of the Tar
tan who interviewed said Gumbart, 
could get no confirmation of the ru
mor, although he was given to un
derstand that more electrifying things 
than this would greet the eyes and 
smite the senses of those with the 
temerity to attend the banquet, and 
that favors of far greater worth were 
already at hand to greet the diners. 
Incidentally it was remarked that the 
Mho Club Tech A. I. E. E. had de
cided to put no obstacles in the way 
of the annual picnic to the Carnegie 
Farm and had, in consequence, 
changed the date of the great gas
tronomic gymnastics to May 20th, 
instead of the 21st, as previously an
nounced.
Mrs. Gertrude Breslau Fuller m
calls us to truth, love and service. 
She is a herald of the better day; 
she is the voice of the appeal and 
protest of the weak, the oppressed, 
the poor, the outcast. She has lofty 
ideals plus the equipment of a careful 
student, bringing fresh material, in
formation gathered from mines, 
shops, mills, factories and tenements 
where she has gleaned for years. She 
is endowed with great dramatic abil
ity, and a voice clear, full and power
ful. Tears and laughter follow fast 
through her lecture. She may jostle 
your thinking but you will rejoice in 
it and feel a sense of life enlarged.

The value of clean outer apparel is 
of great importance. We know from 
hearing comments expressed by all 
classes of people that ones outer 
appareance is most essential, for 
many times the selection of a man 
or woman for a better position in life 
depends, in part at least, upon his 
or her personality (clean and well 
pressed clothes). See Shuman, 3911

This afternoon the baseball team 
comes up for the second time against 
Penn State. Saturday the first game 
of the series was played at State Col
lege resulting in a victory for our op
ponents, who scored eight runs in the 
seventh and eighth innings. Today 
Tech will be out for revenge and will 
endeavor to even up matters. The 
game should be one of the seasons 
best and should be witnessed by every 
student.
Friday afternoon the varsity faces 
the Night School nine. This branch 
of Carnegie Tech has a powerful team 
and will give the first team a hard 
run. The game wil begin promptly 
at 4:30 p.m.
Next Wednesday the baseball team 
battles with Muskingum College at 
Tech Field and every one should be 
present. Little is known of the 
strength of their team of this year. 
Last year we defeated them, however, 
and we hope to duplicate the feat this 
season.

Otterbein faces us for a second 
time on next Thursday, one week from 
today. This means another chance to 
even up for the defeat in the first 
game. The score of the contest, a lit
tle over a week ago, was 2 to 0. Both 
teams received only three hits and the 
game was the best one could wish to 
see. So look forward for a strong 
come back a week from today.
