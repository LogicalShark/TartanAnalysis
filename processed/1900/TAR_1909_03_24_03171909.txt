The chief feature of the week was the meeting 
held Wednesday afternoon, in Room 123. After con
siderable discussion it was moved and carried that 
the School of Applied Design have a Student Senate, 
and that an election be held to elect five men to 
serve, the one receiving the highest number of votes 
to be the chairman. The election was then held and 
resulted as follows: Burkhart, chairman; Jones,
Nicols, Hatcher, and Reeves. These men will meet 
in the near future and adopt a constitution and by
laws, and expect to have the Senate running smooth
ly in a very short time.
A base-ball team of the School is to be formed to 
show some of the Science men and the Industrials 
how to play ball. Lamont was elected manager, 
and Dunn temporary captain. Now, bring on your 
fans!
A smoker and dinner will be held at the Hotel 
Grand Tuesday night. President Rigamont appointed 
a committee consisting of Nicols, Mitchell and Gloekler to make arrangements for the affair.

By virtue of having a sufficient number of awards 
of the Society of Beaux Arts Architects, Gleckler, 
Rigaumont, Peebles, Bruton,. Roebling, and King, 
are eligible to compete for the Paris prize of $2,500 
which provides for two and one-half years foreign 
study and travel. The competition upon which the 
awarding of the prize will be based, will be held in 
the Schools April 3rd. Contrary to the usual ar
rangement of the Beaux Arts work, the entire prob
lem is done in one 24-hour esquisesquis, which in 
this case will commence at 9 A. M. on Saturday, April 
3rd, and finish at 9 A. M. Sunday. For the last few 
weeks all of the men eligible, with the exception of 
Roebling who voluntarily declined to accept, have 
'been taking problems of a character similar to the 
one they will be required to take. The object of 
this preliminary work being to get the contestants 
used to the very unusual and exhausting work of 
getting a problem up under such conditions. Last 
Saturday these men worked on their 24-hour job 
and accomplished their work in fine shape. They in
tend to keep the practice up until the eventful prob
lem arrives, and by so doing will stand a far better 
show of making good, than if they were attempting 
to do it with none of the preliminary training.
As the Tartan goes to press for this week, the 
Italian supper at the Hotel Grand by the School of 
Applied Design will be at its height. Over fifty men 
signified their intention of attending. An account 
of the doings will appear in next weeks Tartan.

Girls, there is only one more week in which to work 
on material for the Thistle. What have you done? 
Have you done your share? Everyone is expected 
to do something. If you cant write grinds, if you 
havent any poetical propensities, perhaps you have 
ideas that some one else can work up for ,you. If 
you are of the artistic turn of mind, get busy with 
your penillustrations always make a book more 
attractive. But if you are gifted only in practical 
ways, secure ads from your business friends. 
And if you cant do that, there is still something 
left for you to dosubscribe. Do it now. Give your 
name at once, also a deposit of fifty cents, to Miss 
Edith Glenn of the Jr. Sec. It will be 2OP^ loss if 
you dont. A word to the wise is sufficientto the 
otherwise, squandered. Let us hope there are no 
otherwise among us.

(As it appears to a Plebe.)
English may be defined as the art of theme writing. 
In order to acquire proficiency in this art one must 
write a theme every night. n* are acquiring pro
ficiency.
First the Plebe ties up her head in a wet towel 
and curls up in an armchair to think. She is all 
writ outbut it is do or die. After an hour of hard 
work she has produced a theme of such magnificent 
eloquence and literary power that she gazes at it in
adoration and astonishment. Her friends pronounce 
it perfect. Eureka! an H is hers. (Why isnt 
there an H+ in the schools system of marking?)
Reluctantly the adoring one delivers her darling 
into the hands of that crusher of sprouting genius, 
the English teacher. Will the morrow never come? 
All day and all night she lives in a state of joyous 
anticipation. But with the morrow comes a thunder
bolt out of a clear sky. Her precious theme is once 
more in her trembling hands. A look of incredulity 
and amazement blots the joy out of her face. Is 
that an F she sees before her? Impossible! Vary
ing emotions take possession of her. She is full of 
surprise and sorrow, but not of angeroh, no! If 
the teacher is so lacking in literary appreciation, it 
is sad, very sad in deed. iShe had been admired 
before, but nowwell, some day she will see her mis
take when the Plebe is getting $1,009 per word!

The little pool made a beautiful picture as I looked 
at it from among the trees on the bank. It was twi
light and the waters were full of mysterious shadows. 
Weeping willows grew almost to the edge and trailed 
their branches in the water. The lilies on its smooth 
surface had closed; dank weeds, through which the 
water glistened faintly, grew at one end. Then a few 
stars twinkled calmly from the dark depths, as if not 
at all surprised to find themselves transported to such 
a strange setting. How remote, secluded, was this 
little spot! Immediately I christened it, The Lonely 
Pool, and turned away with reluctance on catching 
the distant sound of the vesper bell.

Here are a few hints that will help us amateurs 
when we visit the art galleries to at least appear 
to know something. They come straight from the 
old world so they must be correct. They are as 
follows:
1. If the artist paints the sky gray and the grass 
black, he belongs to the good old classical school.
2. If he paints the sky blue and the grass green, 
he is a realist.
3. If he paints the sky green and the grass blue, 
he is an impressionist.
4. If he paints the sky yellow and the grass pur
ple, he is a colorist.
5. If he paints the sky black and the grass red, 
he shows possession of great decorative talent.

drag in the dust the proud boasts of the Amateur 
Cooks. On this particular occasion these Mistresses 
of the Spotless Kitchen decided to experiment on 
those commonplace Proteid Foods called Oysters and 
Fish. These were prepared and cooked with the 
greatest care, and the Amateur Cooks surveyed with 
Pride the result of their mornings work. Their 
Faces did not bear so satisfied a look, however, 
when they partook of those Viands, but the Cooks 
swallowed them down like martyrs.
About an hour afterwards the Resident High Keep
er of Medicine Cabinet was called in Great Haste 
from her Office. Catching up her Magical Vials, she 
hurried across the Hall and there sprawling on a 
low Settee was one of the Matchless Cooks. Her 
countenance was like unto a Certain Shellfish when 
boiled, and she writhed in Agony. One by one, 
other Amateur Cooks arrived and acted in the same 
Peculiar Way. At length, however, the Magical Po
tion began to exert its Spell, the Amateur Cooks 
were restored, and went forth Sadder but Wiser 
Maidens.

The March Wind Elves are jolly sprites!
Look out, girls, they are here!
Theyre wild and boistrous and their pranks, 
Are very, very queer;
With little fans they toss your hair,
Or give your hats a fling,
And make them mount into the air 
Like kites without a string;
And then they paint each cheek and ear 
With red, until it glows.
But worst of allthey may, perhaps,
Splash freckles on your nose!

In his little realm, far above the heads of com
mon mortals, the wise king sits on his golden throne. 
Everything around him, even the palace, is of shin
ing metal. His royal robe and crown are of purest 
gold. Thus arrayed in all his splendor, surrounded 
by his devoted attendants, each day he bestows his 
priceless gifts. In return for these, his adorning 
subjects set his food and drink before him, till it 
pleases his Majesty to partake thereof. After feast
ing, the royal courtiers bring the regal tub in which 
the King takes his daily bath. Then the noble mon
arch- commences the distribution of his wealth. He 
advances majestically, admired by all his subjects, 
and with haughty head upraised pours forth his soul 
in wonderful melodies,for King Teddy is only a 
canary.

Ever since the Tartan made its appearance in the 
Schools, one of. the progressive movements that it 
has advocated was a Student Senate. The question 
was discussed by the different editors in turn, but 
with no result. The first results to accrue from any 
of this prolonged agitation, was the formation of 
such a Senate by the members of the School of Ap
plied Design, at a meeting held last week. The out
come of the experiment will be of the keenest inter
est to the other schools, not only for the success of 
the plan as applied to Carnegie Tech, but as a means 
of solving the problem of having one Senate or four. 
At present it looks as though each of the four Schools 
should have their own.
Someone with a liking to mix into things that are 
none of his concern, finds the student bulletin board 
in the lower corridor a fertile field for operations. 
Last week one of the notices of the White Friar 
section of the aforesaid board was altered, so as 
to change the time of one of the rehearsals. Luckily 
it was noticed in time to be changed back to its ori
ginal form in time to save the trouble that would 
have resulted, but as it was, it had half of the chorus 
guessing all morning. If it was a practical joke, 
its about the poorest one we have seen for a long 
time.
The Thistle board seems to be on the job and has 
the material for the book well on the way, and the 
book will undoubtedly be a considerable improve
ment on either of its predecessors, but like every 
other enterprise that is undertaken here in the 
Schools, most of the burden falls on a very few.
The editorial end is onerous enough and will un
doubtedly represent the desultory labor of several
and the hardest kind of labor of two or three while 
the business end will be still more the product of a 
very few. And this last department is one that needs 
the help of every one most especially. It is more 
than can be expected that the business manager and 
one or two of the faithful do all the soliciting, al
though this has generally been the case. Most any 
one can find the time to do a little work, or at least 
get track of some promising ad. Let the business 
manager know of it. Last, but not least, produce

There have been a large number of papers pub
lished within the last year which dealt with the 
preparation of engineers in general, or of chemists 
and chemical engineers in particular. Most of them 
were written by practical engineers. If the teachers 
of the land have read them all, they are still justified 
in following their own concepts to a considerable 
degree, because of the disparity on the one side and 
impracticability on the other. If the teachers have 
read but part of them and have been deeply im
pressed, they may be changing good plans for poorer 
ones. They may be making the future graduate of 
their courses still more of a hand-book of ready data 
and of evanescent processes, of quick conclusions 
and of decapitated originality. They may be turn
ing out a machine to fit the present requirements of 
a certain kind of mill, which mill will pay a royalty 
of sixty dollars a month for the use of the machine, 
but is this the best attainable? Should not such re
quirements be considered merely as a fortunate de
mand for by-products? Are not the seconds of 
the chemist-plant good enough for the mill which 
wants a cheap machine? The broken saggers of a 
porcelain factory might be a useful by-product, but 
should we forget the making of the porcelain?
In chemical industries and engineering, the 
one thing most needful is character, which means 
integrity, individuality, energy, push, etc. These 
must be greater than the average to warrant greater 
than average success. The memory of the stored 
facts, the familiarity with the prices and names of 
common chemicals, the details of their manufacture, 
etc., need be only an average-grade-accessory. If a 
man cannot think independently, cannot talk or 
write decently, cannot listen internally, and finally 
does not do so frequently and better than the aver
age, then the retention of stored knowledge will be 
a useless task to him.
It may be maintained that such assets as charac
ter, interest, judgment, etc., cannot be poured 
through a funnel, that they cannot be driven in 
with a hammer, that they are hereditary in the man 
or absent forever, but is it true? Are not these 
desiderata largely the result of intimate contact

with such personal qualities as distinct from physi
cal contact with other things? They are not openly 
demanded of the teacher by the student as he de
mands chemical knowledge, nor are they likely to be 
demanded as long as every man feels that he does 
not need them. But may they be acquired? In prac
tice it is the difference in these traits which is of 
greater influence than accumulated knowledge, 
though the latter be ever so necessary. A welltrained engineer in any science will very quickly 
look and act and become like a well-trained chemist 
if he finds himself called upon to go deeply into 
chemistry. A poorly trained chemist may have 
trouble keeping up with the office boy on routine 
steel analysis if he lets himself latibulize. The de
ciding difference between the two is in the person
ality or character, and not in the stock of knowl
edge. It seems as though the automatic power of 
centering and maintaining interest in things was 
one of the most desired traits to impart to a very 
young chemist.W. R. Whitney, in the Journal of 
Industrial and Engineering Chemistry.

The events clustering around the Ides of March 
have proved almost as fatal to the-Plebe class as 
that day did to Caesar. Think of all that happened 
last week. The first day was Monday, very few 
of us prepare lessons for Monday and, cursesa quiz 
in Math.
On Tuesday, Mr. Hornbostel didnt get here in 
time to deliver his lecture. And, in Section C, Kime 
and Spielburg debated on politics and religion. Could 
you imagine anything more eventful?
Wednesday was fair sailing, save for a squall (see 
note below*) which struck crews C and D at the
fourth hour. Thursday the sky was clear, but at
the beginning of the third hour it suddenly clouded 
and a second squall struck crews C and D. The 
storm then abated some, but broke in renewed 
fury about three oclock. For who should appear 
upon the horizon but four fair visitors escorted by 
Mr. Lightcap, who blushed clear down to his collar, 
and Mr. Lightner, who blushed not at all. And such 
excitement as prevailed, confusion was rampant, for 
the fairies stormed every bulwark, drawing-room, 
pattern-shop, foundry and class-room. They made a 
thorough campaign under the guidance of the two 
gallant instructors, and as one of them remarked, 
This is the most exciting thing I have seen yet. 
We heartily agreed with her. And on departing 
we were sorry to see them go, even though we were 
on the verge of a nervous collapse.
After such an eventful day as Thursday, Friday
is scarcely worthy of mention, save to state that we 
were photographed for the Thistle. Again, let it be 
repeated, Beware the Ides of March.

12THE TARTAN
THE A. & J. DAY GRADUATING CLASS 
BANQUET.
During the evening of March 4th (Inau
guration Day), while all eyes and minds were 
turned towards Washington, the Charter Day 
Class of the School of Apprentices and Jour
neymen held their annual, and at the same 
time probably their last large social event be
fore graduation, which took the form of a ban
quet, at the Monongahela House.
To say this affair proved a huge success 
would be putting it mildly.
Although we were a great distance from the 
first citizen of the land, we rubbed elbows 
with and heard his bitter rival, that other great 
citizen, Mr. William Jennings Bryan, who 
banqueted and spoke in the room adjoining 
ours.
After mingling with Democracy for the 
early part of the evening in the lobby and cor
ridors, we sojourned to a banquet hall, neat, 
snug and decorated as a Tech' banquet hall 
should be. The plaid was used exclusively 
in the decorations and the appearance of the 
room brought many complimentary remarks 
from the Bryan banqueters, who looked in the 
room. On the left was the Tech banner 
this was the second time it had been used 
on the right were two large A. & J. banners; 
on the mirror at the head of the room, back 
of the toastmaster, a silk Tartan a yard long, 
was displayed, containing the class numerals 
'09, while on each curtain and portier a Tech 
pennant was pinned. It seemed as though 
all the plaid in Pittsburgh had been gathered 
for the occasion. At each plate lay a white 
carnation. The souvenir menus containing 
the menu, list of speakers, Alma Mater, 
class officers, banquet committee and an extra 
page for autographs, were printed in green ink 
and tied with green ribbon, the class color. 
For the above arrangement we owe our thanks 
to the untiring efforts of our classman, Sha
piro.
As an appetizer we gave the locomotive 
yell. . The quick, snappy response was com
mended by the *faculty. A yell after each 
course and for each of the speakers was the 
order of the evening. Let it be noted that 
the songs, yells and good cheer interspersed 
throughout the evening were of a capital or
der.
After the appetizer we fell to and what we 
did to a most sumptuous repast was a plenty. 
After partaking to our hearts content, we sat 
back, lighted our cigars and welcomed the 
opening address of our toastmaster, Dean Con
nelly. It was a heart to heart talk, for which 
he is famous. We appreciated it immensely. 
No other man has our good-will and respect 
in so large a measure as Mr. Connelly.
The first man Mr. Connelly called 011 was 
our esteemed Class President, W. Ainsley, 
who responded most fittingly, dwelling 011 the 
subject Our Class." What he said was to 
the point and his thanks to the faculty was a 
concentrated thanks of all the fellows, for the 
interest they take and have taken in us.
Secretary Fields next gave us a short talk.
Mr. Morris responded to the toast Founda
tion. If we lay our foundation as he prescrib
ed, we will compare with the Gibralter.
Mr. Pfouts title page was Specifications, 
but his subject matter consisted of wit. He 
was as spry as a two-year-old.
Mr. Birge (who hails from New York State) 
reminded Mr. Pfouts, the gentleman from 
Ohio, that Ohio and Ohioans sprung from 
New York. He then gave us a metaphor 011 
Pebbles, the reading of which flowed like a 
lyric poem from the lips of an accomplished 
actor.
Mr. Leighbon analyzed the versatility of our 
students and did it well. He sprang a new 
Lincoln story 011 us.
Mr. Brown told us of the inducements of 
the farm, distinguished between perspiration 
and sweat, and asked Rough Head" Meely 
if God made him.
Mr. Dosey related a good one on false teeth.
Mr. Hepburn talked on shop practice and 
traveling.
Mr. Hamilton read an exceptional poem 
it pertained to the Bar.
Interspersed among the faculty speakers 
were the following student speakers:
H. T. Young (ex-Class President), who was 
overcome with emotion.
Gilded Dome Frampton (ex-Class Presi
dent), dealt with athletics.
Indian Brown (ex-Vice President), let us 
in on the pleasures of a broken leg.
Colophony" Wehs instigated a movement 
to organize an Alumni Club. His plan was 
heartily approved and will be heard from 
later.
If you wish a subscription to any engineering pub= 
lication it can be gotten through  The 
Tartan at student rates.

---------------------------------------------------

THE TARTAN13
Shorty McTighe told us, instead of the policeman, his troubles.
Leo Hosey (Vice President) was run down.
Messrs. ex-President Davis, Secretary 
Hyhle, Shapiro, 'Deacon'' Werner and Emer
son were also called on.
The incidental features of the evening were 
the effect of the St. Julieus on certain indi
viduals; the autobiography of every menu 
card by all present; Sossongs introductions; 
Eddy Bargmans freedom of press and Wer
ners borrowed vest.
At 1.30 oclock A. M., the banquet was 
brought to a close by the singing of the Alma 
Mater; another locomotive yell, and the 
best wishes of success by everyone to every 
other one when he leaves the scratch at "Tech 
school next May.
GET BUSY, INDUSTRIALS.
Although we, the A. & J. Thistle representa
tives, have pleaded personally with you for 
material for this year's book, practically no 
material has been handed in. Fellows, just 
stop and think. We have equal representa
tion in this book with the rest of the schools. 
There is no dictating or trouble this year, so 
let us appreciate this and turn out something 
worth while.
We must have a frontispiece for the first 
page of our section of the book. This design 
must be in by March 27, so it is up to you to 
produce something appropriate. All other 
material, class histories, grinds, cartoofts, etc., 
must also be in by the same date. Write up 
anything you think should go in a school year 
book, then hand it in, we want it.
All A. & J. class societies, athletic teams, 
etc., etc., which want to be represented apply 
to Toe Wehs, Draftsman, '09.
The Thistle will be published about April 
20, so you will get it at least a week before 
you leave school.

The last of the try-outs for the cast of this yeais 
show, His Highness, the Chef, was held in the 
Orchestra Rehearsal Room of the Carnegie Institute, 
last Saturday night. All the applicants who consid
ered themselves still in the running were in attend
ance. The competition for a number of the parts 
was very close, and it seemed to be with the greatest 
difficulty that Coach Edmundson could decide on 
some of the places. Each successful man Will receive 
a letter informing him that he is to report at the 
next rehearsal with so many pages committed of the 
part he has been chosen to take.
More out-of-town dates are being arranged. Busi

week looking after the arrangements necessary for 
taking the show there. A complete schedule of 
dates will be published as soon as it is completely

An enthusiastic audience greeted the Glee and 
Mandolin Club at the High School Hall, McKeesport, 
last Friday night. Although not all the members 
were present, the men easily overcame this difficulty 
and went through the program with a snap that is 
the sure result of good training.
The proposition to give a sY*XBR$ UOIX*^E about 
April 30th has met with instant success with Tech 
men, many of whom are realizing for the first time 
that they get more than their moneys worth of real 
pleasure as well as help the Musical Clubs, by com
ing to the concerts. The new numbers for the pro
gram are rapidly approaching the finished stage.
Next Sunday, March 21st, a business meeting of 
club members will be held at 2.30 P. M., to discuss 
the dance that is to follow, and to elect the commit
tee for arranging the dance program.
