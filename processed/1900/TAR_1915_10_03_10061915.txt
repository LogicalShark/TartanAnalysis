NEW ENGLAND CLUB 
HOLDS RECEPTION
Yankees Have Lai ge Attendance.
At the first banquet of the year, held 
as a reception to the new members, 
about fifty Tech men from New Eng
land gathered at the Hotel Schenley 
Saturday evening. The majority were 
new men in the institution and they 
were at once introduced around and 
proceeded to see how many mutual 
acquaintances they possessed.
A short business meeting was held 
and the following officers for the year 
were elected: President, James P.
Tumpane; Vice President, Fred R. 
Oefinger; Secretary and Treasurer, 
George C. Robbins; Executive Com
mittee, John W. Towns, Edward F. 
Kelley.
Afterwards everyone sat down to an 
excellent banquet and were filled with 
satisfying viands, that is all except 
Kelley and Finlay, who were unlucky 
enough to miss both the salad and the 
coffee. The president exerted his au
thority and swiped two cutlets when 
the waiter wasnt looking, but four 
other members were entirely unsuc
cessful! in attempting to bribe that 
individual for another helping of that 
yellow ice cream.
Stories were told and songs were 
sung until a little after midnight when 
the gathering broke up with several 
cheers and especially one for Tum
pane, to whose sole efforts the sucContinued on Page 3

Team Will Need Support for First 
Hard Game.
WAYNESBURG IS WALLOPED, 88-0
PLAID SHOWS MARKED IMPROVEMENT
(ROSS COUNTRY 
PRACTICE BEGINS
On a somewhat muddy field and 
before a large crowd of spectators 
the invading Waynesburg eleven was 
sadly repulsed last Saturday. Much 
enforced by the return of Sonny 
Kesner and Levy to the field the Plaid 
eleven received so little resistance 
that it is difficult to judge whether 
our offense is as effective as it appear
ed to be. The Waynesburg squad 
was about ten-pounds lighter than the 
home team and short of substitutes, 
also was so unfortunate as to lose 
the services of some of their best men 
early in the game from injuries.
Touchdown in Five Minutes.
Altdoefer kicked off to Hutchins on 
the twelve yard line, who carried the 
ball to the forty-five yard mark be
fore he was brought down. Frye, the
plucky little quarter for the visitors 
was injured and removed from the 
game. The Tech line held here and 
the visitors kicked to Kesner, who re
turned thirty-five yards. From here 
the Plaid warriors took the outer 
trenches of the invaders, one after one 
and carried the ball to the two-yard 
line. Here a line-plunge was called 
and Kesner turned to give the ball to 
the backfield man that wasnt there, 
then decided he would take it and 
stepped over the line for the first 
touchdown. Kesner kicked goal, mak
ing the score 7-0.
. Waynesburg kicked to Kutz and the 
steady attack was again begun. Find
lay, . Marshall and Altdoerfer making 
large gains at will, and Kesner scored 
again, in the same manner as the. first.

DESIGN PLANS ANOTHER BALL C. I; T. ECONOMIC SOCIETY.
The football team meets the first 
foe worthy of their skill Saturday and 
the results of the battle will be decid
edly in doubt up to the last minute. 
For West Virginia has a team this 
year which has worried two such elev
ens as W. & J. and Penn. Tieing 6-6 
with the former and being beaten by 
7-0 only by the latter, the sort of work 
cut out for our athletes is very appar
ent.
Back in our first season of football 
in 1906, U. of W. Va. won from us 
with a score of 51-0. We played again 
in 1908 and lost again 16-0. So we 
have something to avenge on Satur
day.

If the artists at Design. School have 
extra time occasionally, they have the 
supremely laudable faculty of devoting 
such things worth while. . .
Another Ball is now being planned 
and as soon as Mr. Viehman has the 
theme of his masque complete re
hearsals will begin immediately. This 
Ball, which is to take life upon No
vember 10th, will be the acme of 
artistic and dramatic efforts, no labor 
is to be restricted in regard to elab
orate scenic effects and the men in 
charge have gone so far as to ask 
that the two new wings on the Design 
School be complete and clear of debris 
by November 7th, which has been 
promised.
The age imitated by the masque is 
that of Charlemange and costumes ap
propriate to the years 700-1350 should 
be chosen. The main hall of the De
sign School will be used as a throne 
room which will open directly onto 
the large exhibition room serving as 
a banquet room for the king and his 
retainersnot one of those imaginary 
banquets where the actors drink col
ored water and eat upholstered bis
cuits,but one where every student 
can eat, drink and be merry, as did 
the barons of that unique age.
The members in charge have taken 
a new step to regulate the admission 
and each student who intends to at
tend should notify Mr. Weiss, secre
tary of the Design School, as early 
as possible and request that he proContinued on Page 6
The Study Chapter of the Intercol
legiate Socialist Society which was 
formed at Tech under the name of the 
C. I. T. Economic Society is now 
entering into its second year of ac
tive work. This organization which 
is open for membership to any stu
dent or faculty member in any of the 
four schools had a most successful, 
year. ,
The plans for this years work call 
for a number of interesting speakers, 
many of them of national fame. The 
first speaker will be Rev. Prosser, of 
the United Peoples Church, who will 
speak on the subject The Iron Fist 
and the Progressive Spirit, on Wed
nesday afternoon, October 6, at 4:15 
P. M. in the Design School Theater.
In order to give the new men in the 
school an idea of what is going on, it 
might be well to state the object of 
the society, as a national organization. 
The purpose of the society, as taken 
from the charter, is To Promote An 
Intelligent Interest In Socialism 
Among College Men and Women. 
This does not mean that every mem
ber must be a Socialist, but that each 
and every person joining the organi
zation is willing to discuss the ques
tion pro and con with the idea of 
ascertaining all that is good in the 
subject.
In fact, the speakers who address 
the society are not all Socialists by 
any means. Many speakers will be 
obtained who hold pronounced objecContinued on Page 5
Large Squad Reports For Daily 
Workouts.
Perhaps you have already noticed 
the cross country men on their daily 
workouts in Schenley Park. Imme
diately after the commencing of 
school a call for candidates was issued 
and as a result about thirty fellows re
ported to Manager Schwerin. As a 
nucleus for this years team we are 
fortunate in having Captain Rieser 
and Walker, last years men, and also 
Benter and Moore. Besides this sev
eral other men on the squad look very 
promising. But we will have a hard 
schedule coming and if we desire to 
take first place in several meets this 
fall, as we believe we will, it means 
that every available man must come 
out for the team. This will require 
possibly an hour or so every day, but 
not much longer than that. In order 
to make the cross country team some 
men seem to have the opinion that one 
must be a crack runner. This idea is 
one which is altogether false for it is 
a fact that some of the best men who 
have ever been on our cross country 
team had never done any running be
fore they came to Tech. At the pres
ent time things are being taken easy 
in the daily workouts of the team. 
The pace is slow and is set according 
to the slowest man on the squad. In 
this way the whole squad sticks to

GLEE CLUB MAKES PROGRESS.
Students Derive Great Benefit in This 
Activity.New Men Needed.
The Carnegie Musical Clubs held 
their first rehearsal on Sunday, Oc
tober 3, 1915. They had a very good 
turnout of new men who, without 
doubt, will make the clubs surpass all 
their previous records for being a 
musical organization. There is an 
abundance of material for each part, 
which will go to make a well balanced 
organization. Ten new men tried out 
at the reheasal, making so far about 
45 to 50 men in the Glee Club and a 
slightly less number in the Mandolin 
Club. Such celebrities as Director 
Scalzo and Mr. Hoffman are again 
with the clubs. The first selection 
taken up by the Glee Club was the 
Festival March, by Kerns. This

NIGHT STUDENTS.
The statistics gathered from last 
years registration figures show that 
55 per cent of the total number of 
students registered in our school are 
night students. These figures have 
probably never occurred to the aver
age day student. We who are mem
bers of the day school who walk 
through the campus from one class to 
another and greet the many familiar 
faces, hardly realize that we form a 
little less than half of the total number 
of students who come under the com
mon title Tech Student. Our friends, 
our associations, our activities, and all 
our many different interests connect
ed with the school other than the ac
tual curriculum of studies really form 
that part of our school life which is 
so dear to us. It also forms that part 
of our education the value of which 
is not to be underestimated. There 
is no one, unless he is a dead one, 
who will not readily admit that the 
college education loses much of its 
value without its associations and its 
activities. And the maximum benefit 
that can be derived from this source 
comes through organization which in 
turn leads to that most desirable qual
ity called Tech Spirit. And it would 
seem that a worthy aim which should 
have far-reaching benefit would be 
that of forming a closer union be
tween the members of the night stu
dents. It is of course not to be over
looked that such an endeavor on the 
part of the night students presents 
many difficulties, and also that an or
ganization similar in detail to that of 
the general plan of the day students 
would not only be impractical but 
almost impossible. However, we 
would suggest that more smokers be 
held, more means by which the night 
students could become better ac
quainted be organized.1 There are 
also other activities open to the night 
students, and the stimulation of inter
est in' these activities Avould be of 
great benefit. We have an example in 
The Tartan,this presents one form 
of interest in which both night and 
day students have a common point of 
interest. We also realize that the 
night students have not been given 
much space in the columns of this 
paper heretofore, but we propose to 
change our policy very decidedly in 
this respect, inasmuch as we are going 
to make The Tartan a paper which 
shall give the night students a repre
sentation identical in detail to that of 
the day students. Within a few days 
a meeting will be called of all night 
students who would in any way be 
interested in contributing news for 
The Tartan. Competition will be open 
for a limited number of reporters. In 
the past, although we have attempted 
to devote as much space to the night 
students as possible, we have not had 
any night men on the editorial staff. 
But it is for the promotion of the 
principles set forth in the beginning 
of this article that we feel it our duty 
to do what we can to build up a better 
organization among the night stu
dents, and thus work for th aim of our 
founder,A school seldom equalled, 
never excelled.
TAKE HEED TO THE THING 
THAT IS RIGHT.
At this writing no definite wrord has 
been received from West Virginia as 
to whether or not they will play Rod
gers on this coming Saturday. How
ever, the matter turns out there is no 
doubt but that if our team lines up 
against U. of W. Va. Saturday with 
Rodgers playing we are condoning a 
crime against college athletic stand
ards and are tarnishing our own repu
tation for pure athletics.
This reputation has been carefully 
built up and is carefully maintained. 
To the best of our knowledge at has 
never yet been questioned and there 
is no reason wrhy we should not force 
other rival institutions to live up to 
the same athletic code which we main
tain ourselves. To allow a man who 
has already played four years of col
lege football to get away with the 
absurd excuse that he was only in the 
prep, department of his college and 
therefore those years that he played 
against Tech did not come under the 
four-year limit would show a decided 
lack of principle on our part.
If West Virginia insists on playing 
Rodgers the game should be cancelled 
and cancelled quickly, childish objec
tions that this would not be proper to 
the contrary. We know of no other 
respectable course to be followed. No
thought of financial loss should enter 
into the question. It would simply be 
a question of breach of faith in carry
ing out a contract. We think that the 
sentiment in the student body will 
echo this feeling on our part and we 
urge upon the authorities that they in 
no way back down from the stand that 
they have taken.
THE YEAR BOOK AND THE 
ALMA MATER.
That institution of learning whose 
students publish an annual which is 
representative, complete and tech
nically good, possesses thereby an 
organ of immense value. It becomes 
at once one of the most powerful and 
convincing advertisements which the 
school produces.
Students in attendance at the insti
tution take or send the annuals to 
their respective homes which are scat
tered far and wide over this and num
erous foreign countries. At the homes 
of the students the book is shown to 
chums, friends and acquaintances. 
Very often the book is paged through 
with the owner, who enthusiastically 
describes customs and elaborates 
upon themes suggested by word or 
picture, as the pages are eagerly 
scanned.
A volume of a quality which pro
duces a favorable impression, usually 
causes inquiry about the school which 
published it, resulting very frequently 
in some prospective student sending 
for introductory literature. Thus, 
prospective students are continually 
being introduced into the halls of the 
institution which issued the annual, 
and in so doing the year book per
forms a service, peculiar to itself, of 
infinite value to its Alma Mater.
The year book of Carnegie Tech, 
The Thistle, published annually by 
the Junior class, has always main
tained a high position among the col
lege annuals of the country. As Techites, we all stand for progress, which 
means that the 1916 Thistle must be 
the best year book which has yet been 
issued. The students into whose hands 
the wrork of producing this book has 
been placed, have started their task 
with an unprecedented enthusiasm. 
Quite naturally the Thistle Board can
not develop this book entirely. It is 
not their purpose to do so. They have 
undertaken to manage and edit it, and 
in so doing they wish the hearty co
operation of the entire student body, 
individually and collectively.
It is up to you as loyal Carnegie 
Tech men and women to assist the
1916 Thistle Board to make the result 
of their efforts the best year book in 
the history of Tech; a book which will 
be just one more victory to add to the 
ever-increasing laurels of your Alma 
Mater.
WHY SHOULD HE?
There is a practice going on be
tween our schools in Carnegie that 
is an injustice to the particular stu
dent, i. e., the abuse of the Plebe hat. 
It seems that a man coming from In
dustry School, whether middleman or 
graduate, must wear his Plebe hat in 
Science School. Is that fair? Is the
purpose of that hat fulfilled? No!
If the hat is to promote a Tech 
spirit in the Plebe, why should not 
the man coming in on advanced stand
ing, wear that hat? It is his first year 
here, whereas, the other man has been 
here one, two, or maybe three years.
The Design and Industry Schools 
do not require a man to wear his hat 
after he has spent one full year at 
Carnegie in another department. Why 
should Science do it? Think it over!
FRATERNITY NEWS.
It is due time that the fraternities 
of Carnegie throw aside the veil 
of secrecy and get better acquainted 
with each other and school life. The 
non-fraternity man may well gasp and 
stare at these brotherly organizations 
and conclude that their benefits are 
neither for him nor the school.
Just what happens in and around 
the several fraternities houses where 
some of the picked men of the school 
congregate is shrouded with mystery. 
Secrecy makes an organization either 
feared and reverred or derided and dis
liked.
In other colleges the campus papers 
publish a list of peldges to every fra
ternity. Why not in The Tartan? 
The regulations are also made public, 
giving the new man an understanding 
what can be expected from these or
ganizations. They publish the social 
affairs of each and bring the organiza
tion in close touch with other men of 
the school. Perhaps it is this contin
ual dwelling in darkness which makes 
us feel that our fraternities are not 
doing what they should for the up
building of our fast growing institu
tion.
The fraternities have co-operated 
with the faculty in the matter of schol
arship. But they have not opened 
their houses to campus purposes, 
meetings of a club or committee; to 
a dinner party of a society or organi
zation where non-fraternity men and 
men of many fraternities may set unawkwardly side by side, and feel that 
a fraternity, too, is a part of the 
school. When they become less ex
clusive and we read in The Tartan
that --------- Fraternity pledged so and
so, that---------and----------Fraternities
are going to swap smokers, and that
forty couples attended a dance at------
Fraternity house. Then we shall feel 
that they are not so mysterious after 
all and play a helpful role in Carne
gie Techs life.
Heretofore the fraternities have 
been the only place you could get col
lege life, but now there is another 
place, the dormitories. Wake up, fra
ternities! Show them that you are 
still alive.
The Tartan again offers its col
umns at your service. Give your news 
to our representative or place it in 
the boxes. We will set aside a space 
for your use entirely provided you 
use it. Announce your activities in 
social and school life. Show the stu
dent you are a part of and interested 
in the upbuilding of Carnegie.

ATHLETIC NOTES.
AMICI NOT ALMA MATER.
An incorrect notion among the stu
dents which has been manifest all this 
year and which was again particularly 
noticeable Saturday on the football 
field, is that Amici is our Alma 
Mater song. Tradition decrees that a 
student body shall rise and with bared 
head, sing the Alma Mater of its 
college. But this custom applies only 
to that one song. Hence, there is no 
apparent reason for Carnegie gradu
ates and undergraduates to remove 
their hats when singing Amici.
The cause of the mistake seems to 
be the ignorance of the Alma Mater 
song which was written by Charles J. 
Taylor to the tune of the Austrian 
National Hymn. The students should 
familiarize themselves with it in order 
to use it more frequently and also to 
refrain from singing Amici in its 
stead.
OUR TEAM.
A college or university without a 
football eleven is like an army without 
a leaderlike a woman without a 
tongue. During the past few years 
football has resolved itself into a 
highly specialized science, drawing 
from the players all the energy, force 
of sinew, and exertion of which the 
human body is inherent,
Congratulations then to Tech, for 
our team has shown the true kick, 
punt, and tackle spirit and gives every 
promise for a record season. Let us 
then, as a student body, meet them 
more than half way. Let us arouse 
just a mans mite of that enthusiasm 
that has so long laid dormant. That 
even strong teams will doubt their 
value when they see a whole student 
body arrayed against them not per
haps, in open opposition, but, much 
worse still, in sleepy enthusiasm is not 
strange. Our team, as does every col
lege team, mirrors the hopes and dis
appointments of its student entity; 
and when we stand idly bywithhold 
our money, time and most condemn
ing of all, our vocal supportwe show 
ourselves to be past masters in dens
ity. Do your share! G. A. C.

cess of the evening was due. The 
club voted to hold a regular New Eng
land Thanksgiving dinner on that day 
and every Yankee heart will beat an 
extra stroke up till that time as the 
savory anticipations arise in that 
Yankee mind.
Every person connected with the 
Institution, officers, faculty man or 
student, who hails from the land of 
pie, big fat doughnuts, not the life 
preserver kind which by way should 
rightfully be called crullers, Boston 
brown bread, and beans, is urged to 
get in touch with the secretary of the 
club. Several New England men were 
not present Saturday evening but 
come around next time; hear the Eng
lish language spoken with that famil
iar twang, and smoke a cigar with 
others who also have a love for the 
green hills or mayhap the rocky coast 
of that part of this land of ours, which 
is always referred to as Gods 
Country.

Reports give our opponents an ex
ceptionally well balanced team, most
ly of very experienced players. Bull 
Crawford, one of our star tackles of 
last year, is in their squad as is Rod
gers, who ripped up our line for Beth
any last season. The latter, however, 
has played his four years of college 
ball already and has been protested.
It has not been decided as yet 
whether the game will be played on 
Tech or on Forbes Field. In case 
of the former, extra stands will be 
erected on the other side from the 
grandstand to allow for the large 
crowd. Many West Virginia alumni 
reside in this vicinity and will turn 
out in a body.
The importance of every available 
Tech man being in the rooters sec
tion cannot be too heavily emphasized. 
The team will need every ounce of 
possible assistance behind them, as 
they must overcome heavy odds. The 
effect of the rooting and singing and 
the resulting atmosphere caused by 
what is popularly called pulling for 
the team can only be realized by one 
that has played on the gridiron. Ab
sence from the stands on Saturday
will certainly show the lack of all ap
preciation for the elevens hard word 
and of any sort of spirit on the part 
of any individual except those who 
unfortunately have to hold down jobs 
of their own that day.
The team is working hard this week 
on new formations and is being gen
erally polished all around. Saturdays 
game was too farcical to even bring 
out the good and bad points of the 
scrubs. One thing was demonstrated, 
however, and that is that we have a 
better backfield and more good men 
on it than ever before. Kesner, Mar
shall, Altdoerfer, Finlay, McSorley, 
Brunwasser, Smith, Garrett, and Bol
linger should listen well to anyone. 
The end positions with Lauer, Levy, 
Gibson, Beattie and Perkinson are 
also strong, all showing up well Sat
urday. For once the coach can play 
either a plunging or open game as he 
sees fit.
That Thistle Football 
Song Competition. 
Watch Bulletin Boards.
The following football men are eat
ing at the training table: Lauer, Hellstrom, Marshall, Kelley, Smith, Alt
doerfer, Garrett, Finlay, Bollinger, 
Young, Gibson, McFeaters, Trautman, 
Mauer, Morley, Fremuth, McSor
ley, Brunwasser, Perkinson, Kutz, 
Williamson, and Beattie.
The band put up a most creditable 
performance at Saturdays game, es
pecially considering the short time 
they have practiced. Things look like 
a banner year for that organization. 
We can see now the procession mov
ing up Euclid avenue, Cleveland, with 
our band at the head.
One of our touchdowns was a lucky 
play. Marshall had made a sixty-yard 
run to Waynesburgs five-yard line 
where he fumbled wnen tackled, the 
ball bouncing directly in front of Alt
doerfer who had been making splen
did interference. The latter merely 
picked up the pigskin ttnd trotted over 
the line.
The only time Tech punted Satur
day was in th last quarter whin Mc
Sorley got off a long low one.

THE GUILD TEA.
Tuesday afternoon in the Recrea
tion Hall, the Guild had their first 
business meeting and tea of the pres
ent school year. About forty faculty 
and girls came. It was with a great 
deal of pleasure the officers noticed 
the large number of faculty present, 
and they sincerely hope that they will 
continue coming to subsequent ones. 
There were also quite a few new faces 
but very few old girls were out and 
in the future, perhaps, it might be well 
for the upper classmen to set the ex
ample for the new girls instead of 
vice versa, which means that they 
attend the meetings of the school or
ganizations.
After a short preliminary talk on 
what the Guild stands for and what it 
accomplishes, the president, Miss 
Marguerite Menges, thanked the girls 
who helped with the Welfare Work of 
getting the Plebes settled and ac
quainted. Miss Mary Ride who, al
though on no committee, did much 
to make it easier for the entering 
class, also Miss Grace Searight, chair
man of the committee, deserve special 
mention for the hearty support and 
co-operation they gave. Miss Menges 
then made known her intention of re
signing. The reason given was the 
Point System which gives to each 
office in the school a certain number 
of points. Each girl may hold ten 
points and as Miss Menges had more 
than the limit established, hence the 
necessity of the resignation. It was 
also required to elect a new secretary 
and a new treasurer, as neither Miss 
Drill nor Miss Dewey, last years of
ficers, returned to school this year. 
The results of the election were as 
follows: President, Miss Maud San
ford; Secretary, Miss Elizabeth Dearing; and Treasurer, Miss Jean Barr.
The new president then took the 
chair and asked for plans to acquire 
more members. It was decided to 
form a committee composed of the 
following girls: Miss Helen Senn,
chairman, Miss Agnes Sharp, Miss 
Florence Burgham, Miss Francis
Willis, Miss Janet Mandell, Miss
Dorothy Davis and Miss Mary Ege, 
which should do all in their power to 
get the girls interested in the Guild. 
It was also decided to supply the
socks requested by Major Day, and 
those girls not able to knit, should 
buy a pair.
Plans were also made to hold a 
Masquerade Dance, Friday, October 
the twenty-ninth, and the proceeds 
would be for the Guild. It is hoped 
the idea of a fancy costume dance will 
appeal to all the girls so that they 
wrll be sure to come. Details will be
given later, however, keep the date.
After the business meeting, tea and 
cakes were served and a pleasant, so
cial time was spent over the tea cups.
THE DRAMATIC CLUB.
Two years ago, we had a Dramatic 
Club; it flourished, it grew, but, alas, 
it also diedfrom lack of interest and 
non-support of the girls, just as it 
also thrived, in days gone by, from the 
presence instead of the lack of those 
very things which seem to be em
bodied in the term school spirit. 
Last year, the Dramatic Club accom
plished little; many attempts were 
made on the part of the president to 
hold meetings, read plays, have try
outs, etc., but the girls would not 
come, so the matter was dropped. 
Lately, several girls have been heard 
to ask why the Dramatic Club doesnt 
do something, so to these girls, here 
is the answer: There will be a meet
ing held this week for the election of 
officers for the coming year. A def
inite time and place will be chosen 
and posted. If 70U are interested, 
come, or forever hold your peace.
THE DIRECTORS ANNUAL 
ADDRESS.
TEA FOR PLEBES.
Miss Dixon, of the Home Arts and 
Crafts Department, one of the faculty 
advisors for the Plebes, entertained 
her group of new girls at tea on 
Thursday afternoon. The studio was 
attractively decorated and all the girls 
had a delightful afternoon.
PLEBE OFFICER ELECTED.
At a class meeting held on Wednes
day, the Plebes elected Miss Winifred 
Linn, as temporary chairman. Miss 
Linn is a capable girl and will be 
quite successful in organizing and di
recting the Plebe class.
SORORITY DANCE.
Saturday night in the Receration 
Hall, the Alpha Psi Sorority gave a 
dance. The room was artistically dec
orated with banners and pennants, and 
all had a most enjoyable evening. Miss 
Ruth Patterson was chairman of the 
committee which arranged the dance 
and deserves special mention for the 
successful outcome of the affair.
BRYN MAWR CLUB ENTER
TAINED.
Thursday afternoon, in the Faculty 
Parlors, Dean Breed entertained the 
Bryn Mawr Club. There was a short 
business meeting first, followed by a 
reception. Large white and deep yel
low dahlias formed the centerpiece on 
the tea table where Miss Belleville 
poured. Other members of the club 
from the Margaret Morrison school 
are Miss Davis, Miss Van Hise, Miss 
Dorothy Hughes, and Miss Free.
SENIOR TEA POSTPONED.
Hands Up.
Have you signed for Puppet?
On account of the damp weather 
and lack of heat in the school, classes 
were dismissed at noon on Friday. 
For this reason, the tea which the 
Seniors were to have given for the 
Plebes was postponed till the follow
ing week. It is hoped that all of the 
new girls will avail themselves of this 
opportunity to get acquainted with 
the Seniors and come promptly to the 
Faculty Parlers at 3:30.
On Tuesday at 12:30, the Director 
made his annual address in the As
sembly Hall to all the students of 
Margaret Morrison. The girls were 
already assembled and singing under 
the direction of Miss Stoner when Di
rector Hamerschlag and Dean Breed 
entered.
The Director opened his address by 
giving a hearty welcome to old and 
new girls alike, hoping that all would 
be greatly benefited by this year spent 
in school. He then continued by 
showing them the great loss of noble 
lives in the present world war, the 
need of strong and able men and 
women to take up the problem of liv
ing where others have dropped it. 
Especially does this task fall upon 
the women, for to them is given the 
privilege of motherhood and it is only 
by living good, wholesome lives filled 
with plenty of work and plenty of play 
can this work be accomplished. He 
also spoke of the development of 
women for high executive positions 
and the growing need of a school like 
ours, which prepares women for just 
such positions in life, showing the 
fitness and capability of Dean Breed 
as a leader of this type as the head of 
the Margaret Morrison Carnegie 
School. Underneath the whole ad
dress was a touch of pathos and ten
derness for the Director mentioned 
the loss of both Dr. J. Hartley Ander
son, originator of the present health 
system, and of Mr. Wilson, of James
town, New York, the father of Kath
erine Wilson, a Junior in Margaret 
Morrison.
It was a splendid talk, one from 
which each girl could take something 
home to herself and remember, and 
none that of the time given, although 
it made the lunch hour necessarily 
later than usual.
JUNIOR CLASS MEETING.
At a meeting of the Junior class 
held last Thursday it was decided to 
give a tea dansant for the Plebe class 
Friday, October 8th. To make the 
customary raise of 50 cents in the 
class tax, making the dues for this 
year $1.50please remember, Juniors, 
that your treasurer is Isabella Smith; 
and to have a set rather than a seal 
for the class ring. The setting has 
not been decided upon but sapphire 
has been chosen for the stone. The 
ring committee consists of Miss Re
gina Jacob, chairman; Miss Marjorie 
Carmichael, and Miss Mary McClymonds.

DIRECTOR ADDRESSES 
ASSEMBLY.
Director Hamerschlag addressed 
the student assembly Wednesday and 
brought to the attention of the stu
dent body various points which he 
thought needed emphasis as well and 
also talked on subjects concerning the 
school, the institution and what was 
expected of students here.
He reminded his hearers that the 
School of Applied Industries was orig
inally the pet department of our 
Founder, that theirs was the original 
building of the Tech group, the first 
started and the first occupied. He 
mentioned in passing how the wear
ing of a plaid hat band by the first 
student to register gave the idea of 
adopting the Carnegie Tartan as 
Techs colors.
The welcome to the Plebes was then 
mentioned, the hazing indulged in 
deprecated and the hope expressed 
that the Industry students follow the 
lead of the Science School and drop 
that childish form of welcome to the 
new men.
He also, spoke on the war and the 
need for leaders in the trades and 
teachers which would follow the settle
ment of the present European strife. 
The students were complimented on 
the activity they had shown in insti
tutional life during the past year and 
on the number of officers secured in 
the various activities. A plea for more 
social life this year was made and 
that the possibilities of the Carnegie 
Union be utilized to the utmost.
In closing, Dr. Hamerschlag urged 
each student to do something for his 
school and for Tech and expressed the 
thought that in order to profit most 
by the courses here he must not only 
study hard but he must exercise hard 
and play hard.
The Director then complimented 
Dean Connelley, senior dean of the 
institution, and told how hard work 
had resulted in a physical breakdown 
last year. The dean then said a few 
words and promised something inter
esting for a later assembly.
PLEBES TOSSED.
A rowdy group of bold bad Sopho
mores of the Industry School seized 
upon several of the Plebe class Friday 
afternoon and as a penance for the 
crime of neglecting to wear various 
articles of clothing of the proper hue, 
they had their dignity slightly ruffled 
or rather had their eggs scrambled in 
the blanket. Only one of the men 
tossed assumed an attitude conducive 
to as much comfort on his part as pos
sible during the operation, the others 
affording much merriment to the spec
tators by going up and coming down 
in various awkward and amusing posi
tions. The Plebes are expected to 
take warning from this experience on 
the part of some of their class mates 
and toe the mark in the future.
INDUSTRY NOTES.
The Upper class met for organiza
tion Friday, October 1st. The follow
ing elections resulted:
President, R. W. Cost.
Vice President, E. J. Hedlund.
Secretary, R. H. Zeilman.
Treasurer, M. F. Murphy.
Athletics, J. M. Moore.
Club Room Committee, M. M. Hills,

Class Historian, C. F. Peters.
Cheer Leader, C. A. Parker.
J. H. Clark, ex 16, did not return to 
school this year. He has charge of 
the construction of two large build
ings in Cedar Rapids, la., his home 
town.
J. M. Parke, ex. 16, a member of 
last years football team, was married 
during the summer.
The second meeting of the year of 
the Assembly was held last Wednes
day, with President Peters in the 
chair. The session was occupied by 
an address from Director Hamer
schlag and all business was deferred 
until the next meeting.
H. R. Patterson, 17, who took a 
prominent part in student activities 
last year, has entered the Design 
School this year, to take a course in 
Drama.
A reception was tendered the mem
bers of the Printing Department, by 
Mr. Gage at his home, one evening 
last week. The guests included the 
faculty of the Printing Department 
and their wives, all the day students 
and Mr. Berger, a representative of 
the Ailing and Cory Paper Co.
We extend our sympathy to H. J. 
Bergwall, of Jamestown, N. C., ex.- 
18 Printing, whose father died during 
the past week.
CROSS COUNTRY PRACTICE
Continued from Page 1 
ing along behind the others.
Captain Rieser wishes particularly 
to impress upon prospective candi
dates for the cross country team, the 
great opportunity that this sport of
fers to winning a numeral. There is 
really only one essential requirement 
to success in cross country work 
stick-to-it-iveness. Anyone can win 
a numeral if he is persistent enough.
The schedule this year will probably 
consist of the Wooster dual meet, a 
triangular meet with W. & J. and 
Pitt, and the Crafton meet. In addi
tion, arrangements are trying to be 
made to have the A. A. U. meet for 
the Middle Atlantic Championship 
held in Pittsburgh. Likewise the tri
angular meet with W. & J. and Pitt 
is not, at the present time, exactly a 
sure thing, but rapid strides are being 
made by which it is probable that such 
a meet can be brought about.
Watch next week for

tions to Socialism and the members 
are thus given an opportunity to hear 
both sides of the question. Discus
sions among the members of the so
ciety are held at intervals during the 
year, in which many important econ
omic and social questions are threshed 
out and good results obtained.
In short, any one who has any lean
ing at all towards the subject is urged 
to become a member at once. Be at 
hand on Wednesday, October 6, and 
get full particulars.
FALL TENNIS TOURNAMENT.
Large List of Competitors in Annual 
Event.
Because of a bad arrangement of 
matches it was impossible to play off 
the Annual Tennis Tournament per 
the schedule posted last week and as 
a result it was necessary to make out 
another schedule. This was done on 
Monday evening and already some of 
the matches have been played off.
The rules for the tournament are as 
follows:
All Plebes must look up the upper
classmen and make arrangements with 
them to play off their match. If this 
is not done the match will go by de
fault to the upperclassman.
Sophomores must look up Juniors 
and Seniors; and the Juniors, Seniors.
If one of the parties do not appear 
at the time set, the match goes by de
fault to the other.
All matches must be played by the 
time limit placed on the playing 
schedule. The dates will be posted as 
the tournament progresses. They will 
be far enough in advance to allow 
everyone to get his match played off, 
and will be changed only if bad wea
ther prevails.
The preliminary matches will be 
three sets; the semi-finals and the 
finals will consist of five sets.
ATHLETIC NOTES
McSorley played a much better 
game Saturday than previously, the 
weeks practice having brought a great 
improvement. It turns out that Mc
Sorley has always played half up to 
this year, the previous impression be

4 / 
DIRECTOR AND DEAN AD
DRESS DESIGN STUDENTS.
Upon September 29th, Mr. Hamerschlag addressed the students of the 
Design School, speaking in regard to 
a number of the regulations effecting 
the student conduct. Hazing and 
rough-housing must be renegated, 
the director emphasized and after sev
eral astute remarks addressed directly 
to the student body, he introduced 
Mr. Bossange as the new dean of the 
Design School.
Mr. Bossange expressed a keen de
sire to work in a co-operative way 
with the students and urged them to 
engender the spirit of true fellowship 
and pure artistic skill. We all know 
the criterion to which we must work; 
and hold, but lest we overlook such 
it is well that our advisors keep our 
standards constantly in our light.
Mr. Hornbostel, who always infuses 
life and jovialty into any occasion, 
made a few remarks corroborating the 
Directors ideas and advised that we 
strengthen our mental capacity by an 
aversion to extreme merriment and 
loyalty to our opportunities.
DESIGN SPIRIT.
School spirit is most accurately 
guaged by the attendance at school 
meetings.
A Design School meeting was held 
in the large exhibition hall on October 
1st, the hall was filled and a meeting 
full of life and spirit followed. The 
mentioned students were chosen offi
cers:
President, Howard Pierce.
First Vice Pres., Wallace Smith.
Second Vice Pres., Miss McVey.
Secretary, W. Weiss.
Treasurer, Alley.
Tyler, Spigel.
Historian, G. A. Cook.
Student Activities, Steen.
Board of Control, Mr. McCaughey 
appointed as temporary representa
tive.
DESIGN NOTES.
The subject of the last local prob
lem given out by the faculty, A 
Phonograph Building, proved a won
derful success. The first prize, a 
years subscription to the Journal of 
the American Institute of Architects, 
was awarded to M. E. Boyr, Jr.
The water color class has begun to 
splash and splotch. Futurists take 
notice.
We have recently noticed strands 
and locks of human hair in possession 
of certain Sophomores. Why are the 
Plebes so careless?
Red Trent has sworn to keep 
away from football games when 
Waynesburg plays. He has great dif
ficulty in calculating scores above 
sixty.
R. Alex. Wilson had some beautiful 
red and green spots on his plan last 
charette.
G. A. Spackman still spins thumb
tacks with as much skill as ever. 
Spack admits he has learned some
thing at Tech.
Al. Marks has joined the bunged 
up club. Why not make him an 
honorary member and cancel his past 
dues.
Cheer up, Design School, Martin is 
coming back next year and Martin, 
Jr., is going to polish the portals of 
inappreciative Central.
We have not forgotten good old 
Martin who swept our halls with a 
broom taller than his tousled head. 
The picture of him in dusty trousers 
and shabby suspenders wearing a 
bright blue shirt which matched in 
color his merry eyes, has vanished 
only from our building, not from our 
minds. Martin still is, although he 
has wilted just a little, like a trans
planted flower, since he was placed in 
Central Building, a veritable sun
beam. In Design he was an oasis of 
kind common sense in a desert of im
petuous, temperamental, troubled hu
manity. Martin is unconsciously a 
psychologist. He has as many troubles 
as a telephone operator and contends 
with as many varied natures; but his 
delightful rotundity of disposition en
ables cares to just role off his back.
He tolerated the rogues and vaga
bonds of the dramatic school with a 
sustained teutonic sigh of Hi, Yi, vielleicht sind sie verrucht, an<^ well, 
vielleicht nicht.
He met architectural proddings and 
raillery with sublime equanimity and 
flourished his duster only in moments 
of the most extreme peril. Illustrators 
caricatured and pampered him Yan
kee hurled conglomations of German, 
French and Pennsylvania Dutch, and 
Martin doped it all out and replied 
assiduously ganz gut danke schon, 
or ya es ist schon aus.
On hearing that certain Design 
factions were contemplating his ab
duction so as we could have him back, 
Martin said, Ach ya ich wurde gern im 
Design schule sein aber es geht gut 
so weit und vielleicht wird es hier 
besser sein. The reply was tpyically optimistic. If dear reader, you are 
wondering who Martin is, he is just 
an ordinary looking little German 
janitor in Central building, but he is 
doing infinitely more than just keep
ing things clean, he is making warm 
places in peoples hearts and putting 
glad thoughts into peoples minds, 
and no one in Tech will appreciate 
a Guten Morgen more.
The Fort Pitt Moving Picture Co. 
are making pictures of the drama stu
dents in Th Wonder Hat. This 
was played successfully last Class Day 
by Misses Brown, Duffy, and Messrs. 
Smith, Duffy and Burke.
A number of English Folk Dances 
have been introduced and students 
will be able to see the picture released 
by the Mutual Film Co., in your home 
town next summer. Students like 
"movie-ing very mtlch although it 
it isnt as it looks.

GLEE CLUB MAKES PROGRESS
Continued from Page 1 
year the clubs have a greater variety 
of glee, comic and classical music than 
ever before. Specialties will be one 
of the great features.
The Musical Clubs offer to its mem
bers in return for their time and hard 
work, a royal good time during the 
season. They have dances and ban
quets throughout the year. Public 
concerts are begun about Christmas 
time and the season finishes some time 
in May. About this time there is a 
banquet given to the insignia men.
The concerts consist usually of one 
night stands, with the exception of 
the trips taken during the Christmas 
holidays, between semesters, and dur
ing Easter vacation. At these periods 
the clubs usually take an extended 
tour of from 5 to 6 days. Entertain
ments usually follow the concerts. In 
addition to the advantages derived in 
a social way, you meet the best class 
of men in the institution and form 
friendships which you could not pos
sibly gain in any other way.
Last of all, when you sit at the 
banquet table, with men whom you 
can call friends, and are presented 
with your hard earned insignia, you 
are moved by a feeling which you 
could never experience in any other 
way. You feel that you are an acting 
unit of Carnegie Tech, and have done 
something for your Alma Mater. 
These are a few of things that the 
Carnegie Musical Clubs will do for a 
man who says, MY heart is in the 
work.
The clubs expect to be ready for 
their first concert within the next nine 
weeks. Mr. Carnegie, the manager, 
is working hard to arrange a satisfac
tory schedule. Such a thing is not an 
easy matter to accomplish. He there
fore offers to any student, who will 
procure a satisfactory concert for the 
Musical Clubs, the sum of $5.00. The 
Musical Clubs are one of the best ad
vertisements that Carnegie Tech has. 
Why not advertise your school in your 
home town?
DESIGN PLANS ANOTHER BALL
Continued from Page 1 
vide their passes. This point must be 
regarded as those in charge have been 
directed to regulate the admission 
with precise care.
Here is an excellent opportunity for 
the students to show a little indivi
duality. Individually, in itself, is a 
departure from a complete type and 
so is never perfectany more than 
man is perfect. But we are not to aim 
too directly at perfection, in this 
event, but determine to enjoy an even
ings revel with Charlemange and his 
courtiers at Aux-la-Chapelle.
SEANNACHIE DANCE.
A dance under auspices of the Seannachie Society for benefit of Carnegie 
Union club room will be given Satur
day evening, October 16, from 8 to 12. 
Assessment, one dollar.
The profits will go to the purchase 
of magazines, etc., for the Carnegie 
Union, which is in need of such equip
ment. It is hoped a large crowd will 
be there. Better get your ticket now 
as the sale will be limited.

The suits were selling at this price were a surprise to us when first we saw them. We hesitated some time before deciding to take on a standard line selling at such a reasonable price.

Science School Notes
COOLEY LEAVES SCHOOL.
Typhoid Attack.
T. R. Cooley, who registered with 
the Senior Electrical section of the 
Science School, was taken sick with 
an attack of malarial typhoid a couple 
of adys after registration. On Satur
day September 17, he first felt ill, 
and shortly after he went to the West 
Penn hospital from The Sigma Rho 
Fraternity House.
About a week later he was taken 
to his home in Harrisburg, Virginia. 
A telegram from his father to the 
Electrical Engineering Department 
stated that he made the 24 hour jour
ney very nicely. His temperature on 
arrival at home was 101.
The nature of the attack will prob
ably mean the loss of the year to 
Cooley, since the month or two he 
must lose, will be made up with diffi
culty.
ETTELE LECTURES TO SENOR 
ELECTRICALS.
Tells About Steel Mill Electric 
Practice.
The first of several talks which 
Professor Work has arranged to have 
members of the section make in his 
Senior class in electricity was made 
by Claude Ettele. Ettele worked this 
summer in the Pennsylvania Steel 
Mill near Harrisburg, one of the big
gest plants in the world, and it was 
the equipment of this works which he 
described. Lack of precise informa
tion made the talk somewhat sketchy, 
but the speaker made up in engineer
ing approximations wrhat he didnt 
know exactly. This week D. L. 
Trautman, one of the indispensable 
members of the Pittsburgh Railways 
Co. Engineering staff will be the at
traction.
MECHANICAL ENGINEERING 
SOCIETY.
The C. I. T. Student Branch of the 
American Society of Mechanical En
gineers will hold the first meeting of 
the school year on Wednesday, Oc
tober 13, 1915, in the club room of the 
School of Applied Science. The ad
dress will be made by Mr. Schrech, 
chief engineer for the MclntoshHemphill Co., on the subject of the 
Lamberton rolling mill, something 
new in steel works. Besides the ad
dress the regular business of the So
ciety will be transacted, and refresh
ments and smokes will be served.
The Society held its annual banquet 
at the German Club in June just be
fore the close of school and the fol
lowing officers were elected for the 
current school year:
President, Benj. Schwartz.
Vice President, Lyman Sherwood.
Secretary, John T. Eaton.
Treasurer, Julius Guter.
The banquet was a great success, 
and the large attendance and enthusi
asm testified to the improvement the
Society has undergone since its affilia
tion with the American Society of Me
chanical Engineers.
Professor Trinks, in the capacity of 
honorary chairman of the Society, is 
one of the most enthusiastic members, 
and renders invaluable assistance in 
making the work of the Society inter
esting and useful. Members are taken 
from the Sophomore, Junior and Sen
ior day students and Third, Fourth 
and Fifth year night students.
New men are urged to attend and 
strangers are heartily welcomed.
JUNIOR CLASS ELECTION.
At a meeting of the Junior class on 
last Wednesday the following men 
were elected: Anthony J. Kerin, pres
ident; Andrew Carnegie, vice presi
dent; Harry A. Madison, secretary; 
Carl H. Kindi, treasurer.
SOPHOMORE CLASS ELECTION.
On Tuesday, September 29 the 
Sophomores had their first meeting 
of the year. After the financial re
ports had been read, and various sub
jects had been argued, a spirited elec
tion took place. The following men 
were elected: Edward G. Kemena,
president; E. H. Holzworth, vice pres
ident; A. F. Hanks, secretary; R. T. 
Soule, treasurer.
C. I. T. BRANCH OF A. I. E. E. 
HOLDS FIRST MEETING.
The first meeting of the Student 
Section of the A. I. E. E., was held 
Wednesday, September 29, in Room 
104, Machinery Hall. Although the 
attendance was not extra large the en
thusiasm made up for the lack of num
bers.
Mr. Trautman, chairman of the Sec
tion, presided. There was no fixed 
program for the evening, but Prof. 
Dennison suggested that men who had 
been working during the summer 
might have something interesting to 
relate. Accordingly the following 
men gave short talks:
Mr. Gibson, on the 66000 volt line 
from Brunots Island to Beaver.
Mr. Minor: Experiences telegraph
ing on the P. & L. E.
Mr. Kindi: Electric window closer, 
door closer and fire lighter.
Mr. Kaufman: Circuit testing for 
the Duquesne Light Co.
Mr. Trautman: Load Dispatching 
for the Pittsburgh Railways Co.
The speakers were all well applaud
ed for their efforts, when Prof. Den
nison thought it would be a good plan 
to let the club members know the 
plans for the year. Prof Dennison 
explained that in the two semi-month
ly meetings, one meeting would be ad
dressed by a club member, while the 
other meeting would be addressed by 
outisde speakers. A number of good 
speakers are already lined up. The 
club anticipates a successful year and 
all Electricals are urged to turn out. 
Next meeting October 13. Watch the 
Bulletin Board.

The Passing Show.
Has nothing on Puppet.
Sigma Rho entertained a number of 
freshmen at two spirited smokers the 
first two weeks of school. Music and 
Tech songs were in evidence as was 
much smoke. Refreshments were 
served and the crowds departed feel
ing that at least Tech is not such a 
bad place after all.
W. W. Craig had a smoke fest of 
his own in Sigma Rhos dorms when 
he tried to drive the occupants out 
with his favorite rope tobie.
The Jitney bus is still running be
tween Fort Wayne and Meyersdale.
A dinner and movie party was 
enjoyed by the Sigma Rho men and 
their ladies after the Waynesburg 
game last Saturday.
Sigma Tau had an enjoyable 
smoker last Saturday a week. Many 
men were present and departed well 
pleased.
Petey Houston will return in a 
few days from the West Penn Hos
pital where he has been detained for 
some time with an attack of pneu
monia.
Xi Sigma Epsilon had a delightful 
smoker last Saturday evening. The 
freshmen were assured and did have 
a good time. Music, smokes and 
general good cheer prevailed.
Beta Theta indulged in two smok
ers the first few weeks of school. They 
were both successes in the highest 
sense.
W. F. McCaughey, Jr., is recovering 
slowly from a badly mangled 
thumb.
Everybody is in a hurry again. Our 
days of leisure are over and its up 
to us to keep moving.
The presence of the familiar candy 
boxes in the lower hall is missed by 
all of the old men. Cheer up, boys, 
we can soon have enough nickels 
saved to take us to that Case game.
The Plebe is having the same old 
ailment that his predecessors were af
fected with. He cant remember the 
exact location of Room 113 and Room 
122. If you dont get there the first 
time, just try it again.
Class meetings are now in style. In 
many cases, however, the fellows dont 
seem to like the style. It is rather 
a disgrace for men to be herded into 
a meeting like a bunch of sheep. Show 
your school spirit and attend.

tally. In this series of charges several 
fumbles were made that might have 
proven disastrous in the face of a 
stronger enemy. Kesner again put the 
pigskin over and between the bars, 
making the score 14-0.
Varsity Repeats Throughout Game.
The same policy was pursued to the 
next touchdown which was finally af
fected, after two penalties for off-side 
and holding, by means of a double 
pass between Kesner and Findlay that 
netted 20 yards and a 25-yard run by 
Marshall, that brought the spectators 
to their feet. Here Kesner failed at 
goal for the only time in the game 
out of nine chances, and the score 
stood 20-0.
Here Garret was substituted for 
Marshall, who was still feeling "the 
injury to his side that he had sus
tained in practice, and displayed speed 
and fight. Williams, a new man, took 
Kellys place in the line and after
settling down showed a keen sense 
of defensive strategy.
At the beginning of the next quar
ter Findlay skirted left end for twenty 
yards and then fumbled as he was 
tackled. His speedy partner, Altdoerfer, was running beside him and 
picked it up and carried it over for 
the fourth touchdown. Kesner again 
kicked goal and the score was 27-0.
After holding Waynesburg for 
downs Tech again gained the threeyard line where the visitors showed a 
plucky resistance and defied all at
tempts to pierce the line, so that Kes
ner forwarded to Lauer over the line 
for the next tally and kicked goal. 
Troutman and Bruenwasser were sub
stituted for Hellstrom and Altdoerfer 
and helped put the ball in a position 
from which Findlay scored on a long 
end run and Kesner kicked goal, rais
ing the tally to 41-0.
Kesner Injured.
Kesner received the next kick from 
Waynesburg on his 30-yard line and 
by a brilliant run carried the ball to 
the visitors 30-yard line where he was 
tackled out of bounds and injured. 
McSorely took his place and showed 
much improvement over last week. 
After an eight-yard gain by Findlay, 
Garret skirted the end for 57 yards 
for another touchdown and McSorely 
kicked goal, the half ending after a 
run by Garret and Findlay, 48-0.
Last Half Monotonous.
The team that started the game re
turned to the field for the next half 
and in two long runs by Kesner and 
Findlay Tech scored again and Kes
ner kicked goal.
Waynesburg received the next kick 
and fumbled after two plays, Lauer 
recovering the ball, but Tech was pen
alized five yards and Waynesburg 
made first down, the only one in the 
game. Kutz smashed through the line 
and spoiled the next play of the visi
tors for a five-yard loss. They kicked 
to Kesner, who skidded 63 yards to
the next touchdown and kicked goal 
Levy made the next touchdown by 
receiving a forward pass over the line 
and Kesner again kicked goal.
Scrubs Play Last Quarter. 
Eleven new men rushed eagerly on 
the field at the beginning of the next 
quarter and displayed vestiges of var
sity form in the last quarter, some
what allaying the satiety of the spec
tators. On the first play McSorley 
scored a touchdown but was brought 
back, only to assist Brunwasser over 
in the next few plays, and Garret 
missed goal.
Brunwasser and Garret negotiated 
the next goal in three plays and Gar
ret missed from the field, the score 
now standing 81-0.
The Waynesburg line fought hard 
the few remaining minutes of play 
and showed considerable pluck, al
though it was evident that they were 
playing for time.
Waynesburg recovered a fumble on 
their seven-yard line and attempted to 
forward, but it was intercepted and
the score boosted to 88-0 by this final 
score.
The teams were so unevenly 
matched that it is difficult to know 
just how much credit to give our war
riors, but we feel confident that we 
have a wonderful fighting machine on 
offense and defense that will surprise 
all our opponents in the ensuing 
games of a hard schedule.
The return of Sonny Kesner to 
the line-up after tutoring all week and 
passing his condition, and the old 
war-horse Levy on the right end raise 
the confidence of all the loyal Tech 
supporters. The line-up:
