Most Interesting Game of the 
Season Played Saturday 
on Tech Field
Teclis dramatic season opens this 
evening when the students of the 
Department of Dramatic Arts of the 
School of Applied Design will pre
sent The Poetaster by Ben Jonson 
under the direction of Mr. William 
Poel of London, Director of tlie Eliza
bethan Stage Society.
In many ways this production will 
be the most notable ever done on 
the stage of the Design school thea
ter. In the first place, Mr. Poel, the 
director, is one' of the foremost au
thorities on the acting of Elizabethan 
drama and he has come all the way 
from London solely for the purpose 
of putting on this play. Secondly it 
will be the first time that this par
ticular play -will have been given a 
public performance in America, and 
the third time since Jonsons day. 
Thirdly it is to be a production in 
the Elizabethan manner, the first 
time that anything of the sort has 
been done in Pittsburgh and the only 
time that Mr. Poel will make such a 
production in this country.
In contrast to the performances of 
our time, Elizabethean performances 
are unique and just how unique they 
are Tech students will have a chance 
to see Friday night. Mr. Poel is a 
very careful authority on how Ben 
Jonson was acted and he has been 
very painstaking in seeing that this 
production represents a faithful copy 
of how the Poetaster \vas j>layed 
three centuries ago. The costumes 
for the play are his own and he has 
brought them from London for the 
occasion and the stage picture is

IMPORTANT ELECTION 
HELD LAST WEEK
Officers Elected by Junior 
and Plebs Science Classes. 
Two Other Elections
Last week in the Science School 
two new elections were held, and two 
elections which had been held with
out result, the week before were this 
time definitely decided. On Friday 
morning the Juniors elected the fol
lowing officers:
President.................................R. T. Soule
Vice President........................L. L. Hale
Secretary............................F. I. Lawson
Treasurer..............................R. N. Jones
Earlier in the week the Plebe class 
selected the men who are to hold 
similar offices for them. Since the 
Plebe class has increased year by 
year until it now numbers over three 
hundred, it has become a correspond
ingly greater honor to be elected and 
an increasingly greater task to fulfill 
the duties of the offices well. The 
men elected are naturally men who 
have already shown themselves to be 
active in the affairs of the class; it 
is the duty of the rest of the class 
to give them the assistance which 
they have shown that they deserve.
President............................W. H. Collins
Vice President-----J. H. Kindelberger
Secretary................................J. F. Giffen
Treasuprer ..........................,.T. E. Carr
During the general lecture meet
ing of last week, the tie between the 
three candidates for the Activities 
BoardL. T. Barry, Geo. W. Todd 
>and A. J. Hankswas voted off. As 
a result, Hanks was elected by a 
rather small plurality, the election 
again being very close.
The fourth election was that ol 
Thistle representative from the Soph
omore class. That election had also 
been held the week before without 
result, but this time P. H. Armor 
was elected.
PRES. WILSON TAKES 
A LOOK AT TECH
Executive and Party Pass 
Thru the Campus But No 
Speech Is Made
W. J. BRYAN IS ALSO HERE
Woodrow Wilson, President of the 
United States and Emperor of the 
Philippines, made a ilylng visit to 
the campus last Friday morning, per
meating the atmosphere with a well 
circumscribed campaign smile and 
exposing his delicious looking wife 
to the admiring glances of Techs 
fair co-eds.
The President was in town enroute 
to his summer home at Shadow Lawn 
whither from he had been hunting 
votes somewhere in the West. His 
party consisting of Mrs. Wilson, Sec
retary Joseph Tumulty, Dr. Carey 
Grayson, the Whit House doctor, 
and a retinue oE secret service opera
tives was in charge of local Demo
cratic shell-fish who towed it around 
town for an hour and a half.
Somehow or other Director Hamerschlag was assured by Joseph F. 
Guffey, acting state chairman that 
the President would be pleased to 
speak briefly to our students and an
nouncement to this effect was made 
on the bulletin boards Friday morn
ing with the result that the school 
turned out en masse in front of the

Last week those upper class men 
who are using the chemical labora

last year is being enforced. Last 
year when a circular letter, was sent 
to each day and night student an
nouncing a change in fees, most of 
the men could not discovpr the 
change, for the total amount neces
sary was $48 or {158 as before. The 
joker, howeverlike a rider on a

Thiel has already showed that they

The city fire department since it 
has adopted the two platoon system 
has vacancies for 80 assistant engi
neers. Emergency appointments 
have been made, but every fireman 
will have an opportunity to qualify 
for the place by study.
The rules of the Civil Service Com
mission requires that vacancies 
left by assistant engineers promoted 
to engineers should be filled from the 
ranks. It was found that many of 
these men would be better qualified 
for the place if they had technical 
training. Charles C. Ball, secretary 
of the Civil Service Commission, 
communicated with the schools and 
during the past week Dean Connelly 
has twice addressed the men.

200 STUDENTS ATTEND 
TECH NIGHT AT CHURCH
About 200 students from the four 
schools, together with many members 
of the faculty, attended the Tech 
Night services at the Shadyside Pres
byterian Church, last Sunday even
ing.
It was truly a Tech Night, owing 
to the presence of our friend, Uncle 
John Brashear, who made an ad

29-32.
Special music had been arranged 
for the occasion, which included an

were all grateful to the congregation 
for the hospitality extended.

About 2,500 Plaid rooters turned 
Gut Saturday afternoon to witness 
Allegheny suffer defeat to the tune 
of 27-0. One glance at this score 
would indicate that Allegheny was no 
match for us. To one who saw tho 
game, however, it presents a different 
aspect. The plucky little warriors 
from Meadville, although considerably 
outweighed gave the hosts a terrible 
tussle and even threatened at times 
to get near the critical point during 
the first half. A look at the score 
distribution might serve to convey 
the idea better.

THE ATHLETIC FIELD AGAIN.
In our last issuo we made consider
able comment upon the vary untidy 
condition of our athletic field. Sev
eral Individuals seem to have been In 
doubt as to whether we were referring 
t.o tho Student Management as being 
roHptonslblo for the care of the field 
or to others who may have charge of 
the buildings and grounds. We. wish 
t.o state vory emphatically that wo 
were not. referring to tho Student 
Munagomont.
To our kmnvlodgo If has novor been 
tilo ollioo ot the studonts to clean up 
tllo campus, and therefore it Is obvi
ously also not their duty t.o remove 
debris, rubbish and lumber from tho 
athletic Hold, It would no doubt be a 
vory commendable act on tho part ol 
tlio student body to undertake to make 
the campus and tho athletic field more 
respectable, but this does not by any 
moans suggost; that such is their duty. 
Wo believe that tho administration 
has made due allowance for this work, 
but tho present condition oil the ath
letic Hold at least admits of doubts 
concerning tho matter.
SCIENCE
At the general lecture meeting, 
resident Kesner of the Senior Class, 
itroduced the matter of attendance 
' ; those lectures. It happened that 
te attendance on that day was rath--
 good, but the week before had 
>5qii very poor. Fortunately the 
jor attendance was on a day when 
:V;. ;ere was no outside speaker, and 
U e large crowd came to hear Mr.
, incoln Steffens talk about Mexico,
o guard against the possibility of a 
mall crowd in the future, the folowing resolution was unanimously 
adopted on motion: Resolve, That
every student of the Science School 
is expected to attend the Wednesday 
morning general lecture. The reso
lution really introduces nothing new. 
According to Article !I of tho Carne
gie Code on page 14, Volume 1 of the 
Students Handbook, Plobes must 
attend all general lectures and assem
blies wherever hold. As for\ tho 
upper class men, they are expected 
t.o realize what, good speakers we have 
-men not only of local but of na
tional reputationnnd they ought, to 
tyo anxious to attend. Tho resolu
tion, therefore, is no innovation; 
but merely brings an old fact, to the 
students attention. It is hoped that 
tliero will bo a large attendance in 
the future not only because tho ma
jority of the school effects it, as is 
shown iby their resolution, butwhat 
is more importantbecause Dean 
Leete has requested it. He is put 
to a great deal of trouble in carry
ing out his part of those meetings; 
it is only right that the students do 
their share.
COLLEGE PRACTICES 
DISCUSSED.
The following letter was Bent to the 
editor of the Chronicle Telegraph. We 
do not agree with Bomo of its con
tents, although wo reprint the letter 
to show what tho college student 
should guard against in order not to 
bo misunderstood by the general 
public.
To the Editor of Tho Chronicle Tele
graph :
We all call the college boys and 
girls smart and look up to them as 
models for our children and childrens 
children. They are very smart as a 
rule. Most of them are too smart to 
tend to their own business. They 
make rules for1 the new students to 
follow and if the new students do not 
follow these rules they abuse them. 
Just the other day I read in the paper 
that some of the college girls in an 
older class tied up the new students' 
curls and are going to make them 
wear clothing to suit the older class 
girls. The boys will take a new boy 
student and initiate him as they call 
it. I call it abusing the new students 
civilized rights.
I say this as I am a high school 
and college graduate. I have been 
Initiated, but it cost the initiators 
some very sore bodies. The boys at 
the high school went to initiate me by 
putting me in a pond of water with 
my clothes on. I told them to not 
bother me and I would not bother 
them. But they took not my advice 
and went to take hold of me with the 
result that the foiemost bay nursed a 
broken and dislocated jaw bona. It 
cost me three hundred dollars but I 
taught the boys to listen to what they 
were told.
The majority of the college boys 
would tell you they were Christian 
boys and the girls would do the same. 
They are nothing but savages in an 
enlightened country. The first thing 
a Christian should do Is to tend to his 
own business, something which the 
college boys and girls are not doing 
when they tell the new students what 
to wear and when and how to wear it.
Every person knows that it is 
against the law to abuse 
cause a persons life to be 
put in jeopardy. You or I cannot 
go out to the street and hit, or cause 
another person to get hurt. This 
what is carried on at most; colleges 
today when they initiate a new stu
dent. This initiating or making rules 
for new studonts to follow is a 'break
ing of the law and tho officers and 
high men of tho law-enforcing depart
ment laugh at It and lei: It go. No dif
ference how small the offence is, it 
should be punished.
The college boys and girls are the 
first ones to tell a, small boy to follow 
the pfoldon rule and they are the first 
to break 'the golden rule. Do unto 
othors as you would have others do 
unto yon. Thorn Is not; a person liv
ing In Pennsylvania who would want 
another parson to throw thorn In tho 
water with their clothes on or cut 
tlioir hair off and do other similar 
things which they do at the collages.
It Is not against the law to protect 
ourselves when a bandit tries to take 
our belongings, so who should It bo 
against tho law to keep those savage 
college boys and girls from doing us 
bodily harm? It. is doing a person a 
bodily harm to make them do things 
against their wills.
Your preachers tell you to tend to 
your own business. They tell you to 
be Christians, but it seems as though 
these college students want to be, and 
make others be, like savages and bar
barians. The college students are the 
first ones to cause a morality lesson 
or lecture to be given to an audience, 
and they are the first to break it also.
Our college boys and girls are the 
first to tell a sister or brother to be 
mannerly and they are the first to be 
unmannerly. You folks who say it is 
good manners to abuse another per
son, because you can do it, had better 
take some more lessons in the art of 
etiquette before you tell even your 
smaller sister or brother how to be 
mannerly.
I was a country rube as the city 
boys and girl^ called me. I had no 
manners as they  called the rules 
which governed them. They said this 
because I would not be governed by 
their rules. They tried to make me 
abide by their rules, but when some 
of them found out that) the country 
rube had strength as well as the 
knowledge of how to uso it, and also 
a mind of his own, they left the coun
try rubo alono. The college boys and 
girls called tho country rubo a boast 
when ho defended himself against, 
their initiation by causing sonio of 
thorn to nurse black eyes and tbrokon 
nosos. I did not say that. I got a black 
oyo and bursted lip out. of tho affray, 
as well as a three hundred dollar fino 
to pay. More than one case like this 
is not evon taken to court. I would be 
safe in saying that two-tliirds of tho 
cases like ipine are hushed up by the 
professors and managers of the colgood and no harm I will change my 
views. I do not think any person can 
Bhow me, or any other person, a good 
that is derived from initiating another 
person.
I would like to have this question 
answered in the paper by some ex
perienced man who has been initiated 
several times. Is it a Godly thing or a 
profit-making thing or act to take an
other man and run the risk of making 
him or even a female an invalid for 
life or even a cripple?
I will not call the college boys and 
girls ladies and gentlemen, as no lady 
or gentleman Will cause ahother per
son to do Bome of the things that col
lege boyB and girls cause new stu
dents to do.
The reason the larger and older 
clasB of girls caused the new and 
young students to tie up their curls 
was nothing more or less than jeal
ousy. The old students thought the 
new students would cause the boys all 
to leave them in the background be
cause of-their pretty curls which the 
older students would gladly receive 
if they should do so. That and other 
things the college boys and girls do 
is caused by nothing more than jeal
ousy, a thing that is called sin in the 
Bible. How many people would liketo be called sinners? Not. very many 
Still when we people who believe that 
there is a God and then doetli not His 
bidding in small things are no better 
than the thief and murderer. We as 
Christians, should be more consider
ate of other people's feelings. We 
should also follow the Bible and the 
golden rule when we want to call our
selves Christians. For us to do other
wise makes FO nothing more or less 
than disbelievers and barbarians.

PRES. WILSON TAKES
A LOOK AT TECH
(Continued From Page One.) 
Central building expecting to hear 
sonie pearly sayings emit from the 
Executives mouth. But it was not 
so to be. Instead, an imposing look
ing string of high powered automo
biles, flanked on both sides and in 
front and in rear by motorcycle cops, 
stocrot service men, ordinary police
men and various other persons from 
the mlllXary cast, gazed up the road 
and merrily whizzed by, while the 
students, disappointed and thunder
struck by what at; first seomed a 
turn-down in cold blood, could ,do 
nothing but stand open mothod with 
cheering as they drank in the dust 
that rose as the Nations Ruler was 
speeded on. Tho crowd took it good 
naturedly, however, ovory ono real
izing that, tho President was In town, 
for scarcely over an hour and that 
under tho circumstances it would 
have been difficult for him to stop, 
to talk to any body. Further cause 
of relief was found in the fact that 
ho did not. talk to Pitt students, nor 
indeed even visit their rummy old 
campus.
In the presidential party was a fig
ure well known by many of our 
Western students, And he was an in 
teresting and a pathetic figure too. 
With drooping jaw, disconsolate eyes, 
furroughed skin and silvered hair, 
apparently alone and absorbed in the 
depths of his own reflections, sat 
William Jennings Bryan, huddled in 
the corner of his big car with Mr. 
Tumulty as his only companion. In 
any other city in the country save 
stand-pat Pittsburgh, there would 
have been some sort of a greeting 
from the crowd for the distinguished 
Commoner. But no one murmured. 
But few knew him. And yet had it 
not been for this man there might 
not have been a parade at all.
NEW SYSTEM OF FEES
BEING ENFORCED
We all go to some church or other, 
or believe in doing good. If any one, 
or one hundred persons, can show me

office for $5, the unused portion of 
which is redeemable for cash.
Now the students find that the 
books not. only can be secured but 
must bo secured. A letter from Mr. 
Heyl t.o Dr. James was announced 
as follows: In accordance with the
general lottor sent to all day and 
night studentsa copy of which is 
herewith attachedstudents receiving 
instruction and taking laboratory 
work in the chemical laboratory 
must purchase; from the office of 
the cashier and present to the store
keeper of the chemical lnbatory a 
card showing that he has made a 
deposit of ?5 against breakage. This 
must be done before November 1. 
The last sentence was printed in 
red ink, which fact has caused some 
student to announce that he doesnt 
like the bloody notice.
November 1, Coach, McCullough 
issues his call for basketball men to 
come out for practice. Mr. McCul
lough has a big task ahead of him in 
getting together a winning combina
tion this year, for of last year's var
sity, only three men are left. They 
are Greene, Finlay and Slater. Of 
these Nig Finlay is the only one who 
seems to have his position clinched. 
Unluckily for the team, Captain 
Chuck Meredith, our giant center, 
got married. Thus the team is with
out a captain. In a few days, however, 
the three varsity men left will get 
together sind elect one of their num
ber to the captaincy.
Mr. McCullough has some good men 
among laBt years substitutes with 
which to fill the vacancies. Prominent 
among these are Williams, Craig, and 
Gretzler, of last year's Freshmanteam. Then there is Lefty Abrams, 
Wean, Ebaugh, Clements and Carey, 
a fast man from Oakmont, all good 
men.
But the real success of the team 
will depend upon the class of material 
in the Plebe class. The coach issued 
an early call for these new men to 
come out. For the last two weeks a 
squad of about 25 new men has been 
practicing earnestly. At present the 
most promising of these are Foxen 
and Kofeld. By the time regular 
practice begins, Coach McCullough 
will have weeded out the best of these 
men and 'varsity practice will get a 
flying start. There is much good ma
terial in the entering ClasS that has 
not turned out yet and it is strongly 
urged by the coach that they do so 
soon. Everybody has a good chance 
to make the team.
It was a disappointment to the stu
dents when Capt. Meredith married 
and left school, even though pleased 
for his sake, because they had al
ready lost former Capt. Pick Hines 
and Tumpane. To add to their disap
pointment, Lewis failed to show up 
this year and Jack Meredith lias 
changed to. niglit school.
As it is, we will have a good team, 
for Mr. McCullough is not only a good 
coach, but knows his men. An inter
esting schedule for the team has been 
arranged. One five-day tour is sched
uled, in which we meet Juniata, Frank
ing and Marshall, Penn State and Le
high, on their home floors. The 
schedule is as follows:
January 5Westinghouse.

in the hands of the students. They 
themselves will design their costumes 
as well as prepare and hang the 
decorations.
The period selected is Slavonic, es
pecially as expressed by the peasantry 
of Eastern Europe and found chiefly 
among the Russians, Balkans, and 
Hungarians. The scheme of decora
tion will lend the vivid, semi-savage 
color of these countries and help 
bring out that atmosphere of Bohemianism found only among art stu
dents.
The orchestra will be greatly aug
mented this season by additional 
pieces and will be placed on a plat
form built above and clear of the 
dance floor, so the dancers will not be 
inconvenienced. Mr. Hornbostel, fol
lowing his annual custom, has donated 
seventy-five dollars toward the music.
Refreshments of a very substantial 
nature will be served in the new 
Sculpture Hall in the basement, in the 
wee small hours of the morning. The 
committee has petitioned for lights 
all night and all morning.
Resolutions were submitted by the 
advisory committee, and subsequently 
adopted, raising the fees of students 
from eighty cents each person to one 
dollar and a half for men and seventyfive cents for women. Students must 
be registered in any day or night 
course in the Design School and have 
paid their fees before being Issued a 
pass for the ball.
The advisory council is composed 
of students representing all the de
partments in the school, as follows: 
Messrs. Bayard, Imhoff, Crooks and 
Pierce, of Department of Painting and 
Decoration; Messrs. Viehman, H. F. 
Smith and Miss Katherine Jpnes, of 
the Department of Drama; Messrs. 
Green, Heilman and Boss, of the Ar
chitects, and Mr. Foster and Miss 
Heinrich represent tlie Music Depart
ment.
Mr. Theodore A. Viehman is chair
man of the entertainment committee; 
Miss, Helen McVey of the costume 
committee, and Miss . Jones of the 
committee on the arrangement and 
preparation of the refreshments.

HORNBOSTEL ADDRESSES 
DESIGN STUDENTS
Costume Ball Plans Are Laid. 
Fete To Represent Slavonic 
Period
At a meeting of the student body of 
the Design School, last Wednesday 
forenoon, plans were definitely out
lined and resolutions adopted toward 
perfecting arrangements for the forth
coming costume fete.
Mr. Hornbostel was the principal 
speaker and in an euthusiastic address 
gave his endorsement and promised 
his hearty co-operation with the stu 
dent body toward the success of the 
event. Mr. Hornbostel, after welcom
ing the Plebes and pointing out the 
many advantages to be gained at the 
School of Applied Design of Tech, as 
compared with other schools of art 
in the world today, dwelt almost ex
clusively on the subject of the cos
tume ball.
He outlined the successes of the 
previous fetes held the last three 
years, pointing out the mistakes then 
made and cautioned again any repe
tition of such errors. Emphasis was 
laid on the fact that the participants 
must be Design students only. A few 
guests will be invited from among the 
professional artists. Anyone not at
tired in costume of the period should 
not be admitted to mar the spectacle.
All arrangements for the ball are
DESIGN STUDENTS DANCE 
ONE DAY EACH WEEK
The students in the Design School 
have inaugurated a most unique and 
pleasing method of introducing the 
students to each other. On a certain 
afternoon of eacli week an informal 
dance will be held, at which it is 
hoped the students will avail them
selves of the opportunities to meet 
and know each other better. The 
committee in charge feel that through 
this means the men and women will 
become sufficiently acquainted to en
able them to enjoy more thoroughly 
and without the depressing fear of 
getting a cold shoulder on the 
night of the forthcoming costume fete.
7lie fiijst dance of this series was 
held Thursday afternoon from 4 to 
5:30 oclock, and was well attended, 
and seemingly enjoyed. To further the 
purposes of the dance, all regulations 
concerning Plebe fussing is removed 
on tlie afternoons of these dances.

Undoubtedly the seining light of 
:he day .was Nig Finlay the brawny 
lalfback. He was the big factor in 
winging Allegheny into the mire .in 
he second half. In the third quarter 
Nig carried the ball 63 yards 
/hrugh a maize of Meadville warriors 
jiv a-touchdown. From then on his 
jgains were long and frequent. Out of 
457 yards gained by the Tech tem 
during play Finlay can lay credit to 
'02 yards. - -

Scannell punted to Kesner, who 
carried it back five yards from the 
Allegheny 43 yard line.

also like to mention, in passing, that 
regardless of the merits of this con
tribution, as a song, it at least con
tains some of that spirit which is con
structive in the development of a highgrade institution.
M. M. C. S., Sept. 21, 16. 
Editor of Tartan,
Carnegie Institute of Technology, 
Pittsburgh, Pa.
Dear Sir:
Enclosed find a song which may be 
set to the same tune of Van Dykes 
Where the Flag is Full of Stars, by 
Austin Miles, which I respectfully sub
mit to you for publication.
Respectfully,
M. M. C. S.
So Its Back to the Dear Old School 
Again.
Tune:Where the Flag Is Full of 
Stars.
Near the source of the Ohio,
Stands a majestic school,
And its doors are thrown wide open 
To each youth who keeps its rule. 
Heres where een the poor mans 
daughter 
Learns to ably bear her part;
Heres where both youths and maidens 
Learn that work well done is art.
Chorus:
So its back to the dear old school 
again,
Carnegie Tech for mine;
Well send her praises ringing down 
The long, long aisles of time.
As gathered in her halls once more 
Our loyal hearts beat high,
For what this year of good may bring, 
She must on us rely.
In the struggles of the wide world,
Of principles at stake,
Her loyal children will be found 
A firm, true stand to take.
For the lessons she has taught them, 
As treasures they will hold,
And cherish well the right ideals 
She did Avitli truth enforld.
If all the schools in all the lands 
Where youths and maidens are,
Of all the schools that teach to do, 
Our school is best by far.
Her noble aim is written high,
To make her students free;
We love old Tech for what she is,
And what we hope shell be.

Water, etc. Fifty girls from Margaret 
Morrison will have very similar parts. 
Tech men will repiesent Science and 
Architecture. Two girls will personi
fy Art and Drama.
The staging is being handled by a 
group of Tech men and Tlieo. Viehman 
is the stage director. Assisting him 
are John Burke, Fred Stein,. Wm. 
Viehman and Howard Smith.
Mr. Karl Heinrich, instructor of 
dancing in the Drama department, has 
charge of all the dancing in the Pa
geant. Several Design men are work
ing out a country dance with the Eng
lish Folk Dancing Society for the in
terlude.
The mechanical end has been care
fully attended to. A special stage 
has been provided to suit the special 
needs of the production. It is divided 
into three ramps of graduated heights. 
The highest, or logeion, is where the 
symbolic representations are made. 
The second, or pro-logeion, is to be 
used for historic episodes and the low
est, or orchestra, will be used for the 
dances.
The entire action is nothing but 
pantomime.
A plan whereby readers will be con
cealed to offer the words of the book 
has been made. Hence it gives the 
actors greater freedom and assures 
the audience a good means of hearing 
all that is said. Wm. Stein will be 
one of the readers.
A very novel effect will be the use 
of a steam curtain to aid in changing 
the scenes. A similar one was used 
at the Newark (N. J.) Pageant with 
great success.
Altogether there will be some 2,500 
persons to tell the story of Pittsburgh 
from the days of the Indians to 
prophetic idea of the time when it 
shall have become the City of Man! 
Freedom. A chorus of 1,000 singers 
will offer original music.

RE-ELECTION HELD BY 
DESIGN STUDENTS
Due to a misunderstanding of the 
constitution governing school elec
tions, the students of the School of 
Design were compelled to hold a new 
election for the positions on tlio 
Board of Control and the Student Ac
tivities Board.
The mistake consisted In the ncglect 
to  make clear to the girls of the 
School of Design that they were not 
entitled to a vote on the candidates 
for these oillcos, since they do not 
pay student activities dues. By cast
ing their votes in the previous elec
tion for candidates for the above posi
tions they thus invalidated the elec
tion.
The successful candidates in the 
previous election were re-elected-, how
ever, without trouble. They are: M. 
C. Adams for Student Activities 
Board, and J. R. Kilburn for Board of 
Control. Martin E. Boyer, Jr., was 
elected senior representative for Stu
dent, Senate.

of the Department of Fine Arts, do

by Miss Euphemia Balcewell and 
talks to children by Miss May Reed 
and others who have labored in this 
field during the past two years.
Aside from the educational work 
there will be unusually important 
lectures, provided iby the Department 
of Fine Arts, during the winter upon 
the subjects of painting, sculpture 
and architecture. Notices of these lec
tures will be posted on the bulletin 
board at the Post Office in the Cen

and are well worth the attention of 
any student interested in fine arts.
Insuring companies require a large1

Dr. Fettke delivered a lecture on the 
Geology of the Mesa Verde Region of

It had been planned to hold the 
second annual Interscliool Sophomore 
Hop sometime in the near future, but 
that plan has been abandoned be
cause Carnegie Union is busy every 
Friday and Saturday evening for sev
eral months. The Sophomores of De

President Rice appoint a committee 
of two to confer with similar com
mittees from the other schools. When 
these men met with others appointed 
by President Butts of Science and 
Kaiser of Industriesthe members 
from Margaret Morrison unfortunate
ly being absentthey found that the 
only date available was this Friday, 
the 27th of October. The committee 
was going ahead with arrangements, 
when the Design Sophs decided that 
the date was too near and other en
gagementsincluding a play in the 
Design theater and skating party at 
the Gardentoo numerous to hold the 
affair on the 27th. This, of course, 
does not. mean that the dance has 
been abandoned entirely; but the 
present committee will probably re1 main in existence, and the affair will 
certainly be held sometime in Decem
ber or January.
John W. Beatty, director, announc
es important plans which have been 
made by the Department of Fine 
Arts of Carnegie Institute providing 
for art education in Pittsburgh this 
winter. Lectures on art will be giv
en and classes of students will be 
conducted through the galleries and 
halls of the Carnegie Institute under 
the direction of members of the De
partment of Fine Arts and teachers 
in the public schools. In connection 
with this work there will be distrib
uted each month to all the eighth 
grade students in the public schools 
a small reproduction of one of the 
important paintings in the Institutes 
permanent collection, together with 
biographical and other information 
concerning the painter. A brief 
guide to the permanent collections is 
being prepared which will be of fur
ther assistance in this work and which 
will be for free distribution to the 
adult visitor as well as to the school 
children. Director Beatty has been 
in consultation with the superinten
dent of the Pittsburgh Public Schools 
Dr. William M. Davidson, and the 
Director of Art Education, Mr. C. 
Valentine Kirby and a comprehensive 
plan was prepared which lias been 
approved by the Fine Arts Commit
tee. All of the students of the 
eighth grade in the entire public 
school system will visit the galleries 
twice during the winter to receive in

students have visited the galleries 
during the past years for this pur

The attraction at the Strand, the 
Rowland and Clark Theater, at For

guerite Clark in "Silks and Satins. 
This is the second time that this 
picture lias been played at the 
Strand, but so many requests were j 
received from persons who had been 1 
unable to see it 011 its first presen
tation, that it was decided to re
peat the picture. It is without doubt 
one of the most entrancing photo
plays in which the captivating Miss 
Clark has appeared.
Thursday the first of the Scarlet 
Runner series starring Earle Wil
liams will be shown, its title being 
The Car and His majesty. These 
pictures, each of which is complete 
in itself, are full of ginger and excitement. Frances Nelson and Arthus Ashley will also be seen in 
The Revolt," a drama of a woman 
who was dissatisfied with her mar
riage and attempted to break away 
from its chains.
Friday I-Iukla From Holland, in 
which the famous Mary Pickford is 
starred is the attraction, the last 
picture on the Paramount program 
in which Mary will be seen. The 
picture has a most amusing plot and 
the star is supported by an excellent 
cast including some of the cutest 
children ever seen on the screen.
Saturday Win, Farnum, one of the 
most popular male stars on the 
screen is presented in The Fires of 
Conscience,' a gripping Fox drama 
of a different type than in which 
Farnum usually appears.
Monday Wallace Reid and Cleo

It has been said before that the 
Athletic Association is showing a lot 
of pep this year. Anyone who at
tended their party last Tuesday after
noon in the Recreation Hall could 
have 110 doubt of this. The room was 
docoratod with autumn loaves and Avas 
arranged to'represent a cabaret scone. 
Refreshments, consisting of hot choco
late arid doughnuts were served at 
small tables wMcjli. were scattorod 
about the room. Tho program iniCluded songs by a chorus of waitresses 
and men, a toe dance by Miss 
Lenoro King, and a McGlnty dance 
by six sophomoreH; general dancing 
took placo between members. The 
cabaret atmosphere was well carried 
out, even to candied cigarettes and 
the event was a decided success. Its 
chief purpose was to gain now mem
bers and to induce new ones to pay 
their dues. Credit should be given 
Miss Florence Burgham, president of 
the organization, and Miss Marjorie 
Carmichael, chairman of the commit
tee, for the able way In which the 
whole thing was handled.

At last we are to have Shake
speare Without Words"; all the 
beauty, dignity and action of the 
great dramatists greatest plays with
out the handicap of the formal Eng-' 
lish of his times. The coming of 
Francis X. Bushman and Beverly 
Bayne to the Schenley Theater No
vember 6, for two performances a day 
all week, of Shakespeare's master
piece of love and tragedy, Romeo 
and Juliet, produced in a two-hour 
photoplay, marks a new episode in 
the drama. It brings Shakespeare 
closer to the people than ever it has 
done before.
In this elaborate screen production 
of Romeo and Juliet, in which Fran
cis X. Bushman and Beyerly Bayne 
portray the roles of the immortal 
lovers, these two famous stars are 
supported by the most notable cast 
ever assembled for a motion picture. 
There are scores of prominent artists 
of both the stage and screen, and the 
long roster includes a Booth, a Sothern, a Mantell, a Kemble and a Dav
enport, names that represent, the 
greatest histrionic families of this and 
a past generation.
The principals in this two-hour picturization of Shakespeares Immortal 
romantic drama are all leading dra
matic actors and actresses with world
wide reputations. Ma'hy of them have 
starred in Shakespearean parts, and 
nearly every member of the cast has 
had a classical training. More than 
six hundred persons were used in the 
production, and no expense has been 
spared to make it the most notable 
offering that lovers of the silent dra
ma have yet seen.
The cost of the production was 
$250,000.
The first picture was taken May 25,
1916; the last, August 23, 1916thir
teen weeks to a day.
The cost of the costumes alone 
amounted to $35,000.
A. scenario made from William 
Shakespeares great drama, Romeo 
and Juliet, was submitted by John 
Arthur and accepted; Rudolph De 
Cordova modified and augmented this, 
and John W. Noble made the final 
changes.
All the leading characters of the 
play really spoke Shakespeares lines 
while going through the appropriate 
action. Whenever a player forgot a 
speech the camera was stopped, and 
he was obliged to begin over again.
Six hundred players were employed 
in the production of Romeo and 
Juliet.
Eighteen buildings, reproducing the 
old market-place of mediaeval Verona, 
were built for the production. A great 
storm destroyed these just as pictures 
were about to be taken and they had 
to be entirely rebuilt at a total of 
more than ?25,000.
The costumes that Francis X. Bush
man and Beverly Bayne wore In the 
big screen- production of  Romeo and 
Juliet cost what many persons would 
consider a comfortable fortune. No 
expense was spared in making this 
marvelous eight-reel feature, and it 
has set a new mark in classical pro
ductions for the screen. During the 
performances at the Schenley Thea
ter, the week of November 6, the mat
inees will begin at 2:15 and the even
ing performances at 8:15 oclock. The 
prices of seats remain the same as at 
present, 10 cents for a part of the 
house, and are augmented no higher 
than 25 cents elsewhere. No other 
theater in the city could give such a 
production under a dollar a seat.

FALLTENNISTOURNAMENT 
DRAWING TO A CLOSE
Kossler, King and Stark Have 
Already Won Places in 
Semi-Finals
GET LINE ON NEW MEN
The fall tournament which has been 
in progress for several weeks, has 
reached the semi-final round, where 
Kossler and King will light It out 
to see who will be the winner of 
the lower bracket, while in the upper 
half Stark will play the winner of 
the Y. Grlffith-W. W. Warren match 
for a place in the ilnals.
This yoar no varsity men were 
eligible to play in the tournament; 
so that a line could bo gotten on all 
the new men, who might prove to 
be varsity material for next spring.
The entry list this fall included 
the names of 50 racquet wielders 
and has brought out some very 
good tennis as well as a few sur
prises. Probably the most notice
able upset in the draw was the de
feat of R. W. Spring, one of last 
year's men, iby E. M. Griffiths of the 
Science School, by the scores of 7-5, 
16; G3. In only one set, the sec
ond, did Spring show any of his old 
pep, that made him a valuable sub
stitute last year.
Kossler Shows Form.
Kossler, a. Science Sophomore, has 
played steady tennis all through the 
tournament losing only three games 
out of 39 played. He defeated W. C.. 
Porter, his first opponent, 61; .61; 
while R. Einstein lost to him in the 
second round 60; 60; and his 
third victim was "Andy Carnegie by 
the scores of 61; 60.
Other interesting results were the 
victories of W. W. Warren from E. 
M. Pugh 63; 63. Stark beat Ho
gan 62; 62. and later took over 
P. I-Iaslage to the tune of 62; 62. 
King won from Statz for a place in 
semi-final round 63; 61, after
some interesting tennis.
The tournament will be completed 
this week and bids fair to bring put 
some fast tennis.

process now used. This process gives 
phenol from a sulphination of benzol

the chemical. About 40 men were 
present. After the lecture, smokes 
and eats were served.

sive game and who can handle the 
forward fiing in masterly fashion.
Two Pittsburgh boys, Lucas and 
Werling, are holding down the tack
les and are playing the game up to 
the handle.
Koenig, another Pittsburgher, is at. 
center again this year and is play
ing the same fine roving game he 
played last fall. 1-Ie figures in a 
great many plays as he Is especially 
good at haidling tho ball. At either 
side ol Koenig will be Jackson, who 
weights 180 pounds, and Harter, tho 
giant of the team, who is six-feet 
five inches tall.
Back-Field Is Fast.
Tho back-fleld is exceptionally fast 
with Callahan and Snyder at the 
halves and Captain Plorlotto at quar
ter. At full-back is Lalir of Racine, 
Wis., a. six-footer, who  tips the 
scales at 180 pounds. Ho Is very 
aggressive and good on the defensive, 
as well as being the best kicker on 
the squad.
Coach Rowley has been pointing 
the team for this game all year and 
reports from Greenville have it that 
unless the Tech team is on their 
toes every minute they are going to 
hit an unexpected snag in Thiel that 
will not resemble last years 25 to 0 
victory at the start of the season.

quite lilcely to be very pleasing. to 
the eye. Practically the entire dra
matic class has been cast in the 
play and the actors have been given 
parts that fit their peculiar, abilities.
The Poetaster is not the best of 
Jonsons plays but it is the play that 
best reflects the London of his time. 
It was privately acted in 1601 at the 
Blackfriars theater, London, by the 
Children of Queen Elizabeths Chapel 
Royal. It deals with the adventures 
of young Ovid and his court friends 
who meet at the house of a city 
jeweler and his wife to carry on 
their love intrigues. In return for 
this hospitality the citizen and his 
wife are entertained at Court iby the 
Emperors daughter, unknown to her 
father. Tho young people lmvo a 
banquet and imitate tho gods and 
goddesses In a profane way which 
enrages tho emperor who has them 
all disgraced and banished. The 
whole play Is supposed to bo a satire 
on a work gotten out at. tho timo by 
a man by the name of Chapman who 
praises the Greek heroes for their 
virtue and morality. Shakespeares 
"Trodius and Cressida was also 
written as a satire on Chapmans 
work. The scene of the play is 
Rome, but the characters and inci
dents referred to in the play are essentially or the London o 1000.
OF INTEREST 
TO THE 
VOTERS
IN FIGURING ON YOUR COURSE IN THE 
PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN TO BE DECIDED 
ON NOVEMBER 7THMR. WORKINGMAN 
YOU SHOULD NOT LOSE SIGHT OF THESE 
POINTS FOR AN INSTANT:
Before the European war started, or rather, in 
the early months of 1914, you did well to work half 
time. That was due to the Underwood or Demo
cratic Tariff Law.
After this terrible war is over you will have to 
adjust yourselves to half-time again, if the Demo
crats are successful.
To avoid this condition you must be protected 
from cheap foreign labor. For every $1,000.00 
worth of foreign manufactured material that is 
brought into this country, you lose $500.00 in wages 
Why? Because you have no protective tariff to 
safeguard you.
The Republican Party stands Four-Square for 
a Protective Tariff. That means protection for 
American industry and American Labor against 
cheap foreign competition.
The friend who helps you while on earth is of 
valuethe friend who safeguards your family after 
your death is possibly more valuable. While Gov
ernor of New York, Mr. Hughes conducted an in
vestigation of insurance companies and disclosed 
some unfavorable facts. Workingmen buying in
surance for their families found their foresight had 
come to naught because of mismanagement. Hughes 
corrected that and placed all companies on a solid 
basis.
That one act, performed in the face of great 
and powerful opposition, was the greatest thing 
ever done for labor or any other class in this coun
try. Ask your wife if this is not so.

ernor makes him the greatest friend the working
man has ever had in public office.
