Mr. Henry Hornbostel gave an in
teresting account of his recent visit 
to the Panama-Pacific Exposition, last 
Friday in Design Theatre.
Mr. Hornbostel designed the Penn
sylvania State Building. The building 
is of Colonial architecture, character
istic of the formative period of the 
state. The plan consists of a central 
loggia flanked by two wings. The 
loggia is composed of tall slender col
umns which enclose a central vesti
bule where the Liberty Bell will rest. 
Each side connects with the terrace 
and gardens. On the west of the log
gia is the assembly hall and reception 
room on the east.
Above the doors ofthese rooms are 
bronze panels, work of Miss Sue E. 
Watson of the Design School. One 
represents the steel puddler at work, 
the other a coal miner. Above these 
are two mural paintings, by Edward 
Trumbull, of Pittsburgh. The paint
ing on the east wall represents Penns 
Treaty with the Indians, on the west 
Steel Industry of Pennsylvania.
The reception room is octagonal in 
plan. The pilasters on the walls sup
port a vaulted ceiling containing a 
beautiful sky-light. Around the room 
is a series of seven paintings by Chas. 
J. Taylor, of Department of Painting 
and Illustration, Design School. The 
subjects are as follows: The Country 
Church, Country Schoolhouse, 
The Old Mill, Canal Lock, Boat 
Landing at Fort Pitt, A Winter 
Scene, and The County Fair. The 
ceiling of the room was by Mr. Sotter 
and Mr. Sparks.
The four large urns which are on 
the approaches to the loggia are by 
August Zeller, of Design School and 
Earl B. McKinney of Pitt. There are 
eight different groups representing re
spectively Independence Day, 
Blind Mans Buff, The Old Swim
ming Hole, Playing Soldier, 
Newsboy and Bootblack, Romping 
Children, Football, and A Little 
Dutch Band.
Mr. Hornbostel went on to describe 
the wonders and beauties of the ex
position in general. The first thing 
that catches ones eye is the vivid and 
gorgeous colors of buildings, gardens 
and lights. The entrance wall which 
is about one mile long is composed 
of a bank of flowers set horizontally 
in boxes. The flowers are cared for
bontinued on gage 6
The following Track Schedule has 
been completed by Manager Overdorf:
April 17, Inter-School Meet at Tech 
Field; April 23-24, Pennsylvania Re
lays at Philadelphia; May 1, Open; 
May 8, Interscholastic and Allegheny 
Dual Meet at Schenley Oval; May 15, 
Pitt Dual Meet at Schenley Oval; 
May 22, Pitt Intercollegiate Meet at 
Schenley Oval; May 29, Westminster 
Dual Meet at New Wilmington.
The most important indoor meet of 
the year and an event of the greatest 
interest will be the P. A. A. Meet 
in Duquesne Garden on March 13. 
Carnegie has a capable indoor team 
as is shown by the places she took in 
the Press Indoor Meet last fall. The 
coming meet will be for the Middle 
Atlantic Championship and will be 
contested by many of the various col
leges in this section of the country, 
including Cornell, Penn and Prince
ton. A mile relay will be held for 
Pennsylvania colleges with Carnegie 
Tech, University of Pittsburgh, W. 
and J., Carlisle Indian School, Penn 
State, Indiana State Normal School 
and others competing. Besides this 
there will be nineteen other events on 
the program. Regulation M. A. A. 
medals of gold and silver will be 
awarded the winners of championship 
events with P. A. A. die medals for 
the special events. Individual cups 
will be given the winner for the relay 
races and a placque goes to the team 
scoring the most points in the open 
and championship events combined.
Although the exact entries are un
known the relay team will probably 
be selected from the following six 
men: Dunseith, Heil, Saltsburg, Pat
terson, Hemman, and Finley.
Manager Overdorf announces that 
he has laid out a seven-foot circle in 
the gymn and weight men may prac
tice there with the indoor shot, any 
time after 6 P. M.

Manager Pringle has practically 
completed the following schedule for 
this years baseball team.
Saturday, April 17, Juniata at Tech 
Field; Wednesday, April 21, Pitt at 
Tech Field; Saturday, April 24, West 
Virginia at Morgantown; Thursday, 
April 29, Otterbein at Westerville, O.; 
Friday, April 30, Ohio Northern at 
Ada, O.; Saturday, May 1, Heidelberg 
at Tiffin, O.; Wednesday, May 5, W. 
and J. at Tech Field; Friday, May 7, 
Juniata at Huntingdon, Pa.; Saturday, 
May 8, Penn State at State College; 
Thursday, May 13, Penn State at Tech 
Field; Friday, May 14, Otterbein at 
Tech Field; Saturday, May IS, Musk
ingum at New Concord, O.; Wednes
day, May 19, Open; Thursday, May 20, 
Pittsburgh Independents at Tech 
Field; Tuesday, May 25, Pitt at Forbes 
Field; Saturday, May 29, Grove City 
at Grove City; Saturday, June 5, Alum
ni at Tech Field.
The date of the game with Otter
bein University, to be played at Tech 
Field, has not as yet been definitely 
determined but it will probably come 
on the date stated above.
The new field, where the permanent 
athletic stadium is to be erected, may 
possibly be ready in time for the first 
game. It is situated just west of the 
Margaret Morrison School and east 
of the Science Building. As it is situ
ated in a valley the hills on the sides 
will form a natural amphitheater. It 
is most favorably situated and ought 
to make an excellent stadium.
Carnegie will have many of her old 
men back to a form a nucleus for a 
strong team this season. The list is 
as follows: Hines and Ryan, pitchers; 
Lane, catcher; Humphrey and Oeffinger, infield; Kreider and Lobert, 
outfield. Besides this there will be 
much good new material. Doeherty 
of Fifth Avenue High, McClure of Mt. 
Union and Bill Dawson of Penn State 
seem sure to hold down positions.
It is rumored that A1 Wagner, with 
Honus to help him, may coach the 
team next season. With this asset in 
the coaching line and such a wealth 
of material the team should put in a 
strong bid for local collegiate honors. 
Indoor practice was started Wednes
day afternoon and will be continued 
until Easter vacation.
For the coming week, we have 
three games scheduled, two of which 
will be played at home, while the third 
will be played on Saturday night at 
the Westinghouse Club against the 
team of that place. Tonight at the 
Field House, Tech meets a cold prop
osition with Ice in the team, in the 
form of the University of West Vir
ginia five. Tomorrow night, Pitt will 
be the attraction. Everybody knows 
what this game means. A big crowd 
is expected, even though the dope 
points in favor of our opponents. Pitt 
will bring a large delegation of root
ers along. As an added feature, it 
might be said that this is Honus and 
Al. Wagners last evening with the 
team. Lets turn out and show them 
their services have been appreciated 
and that we want them back for base
ball. Several members of the Pirates 
have also signified their intention of 
coming out and help root for Tech. 
The band will be there, and a dance 
after the game. So dont forget the 
big doings. It will be the last big 
home game of the season.
Pitt will not have an easy game, 
judging from former meetings be
tween the teams, and the more men 
we have out, the harder it will be 
for them. Come out and see the big 
leaguers perform.

A number of reports have reached 
our ears that a certain Plebe member 
of the basketball team has consistently 
disregarded the training regulations. 
We seldom take occasion to single 
out an individual in such an open man
ner, but the offender in question is so 
arrogant and apparently self-import
ant, we feel we would be shirking our 
duty if we neglected to advise the stu
dent body of the presence in their 
midst of this august personage. He 
may best be described as a traditional 
freshman who knows not and knows 
not that he knows not. Unfortunate 
youth, he is afflicted with the horrible 
disease of megalocephalitis which in 
plain United States means swelled 
head.
Breaking training is an act that 
should not be tolerated on any Car
negie team and when the offense is 
openly committed by a Plebe, his 
punishment should be made to serve 
as an example to others. Incidentally 
we are reminded the blanket needs an 
airing.
SPslPIIT ShCiPvIITt
In offering a well meant criticism 
recently one of our friends remarked 
that it was about time for The Tartan 
to start something, and while not 
original, his idea is worthy of consid
eration. It is comparatively easy, in 
a literal sense, to start something. 
Any scandal monger may spread ru
mors and any narrow-minded person 
may voice his biased and prejudiced 
opinions. The difficult thing to do is 
to finish what has been begun.
Because of its limited sphere of 
activity, a college paper must be re
sponsible for everything it contains. 
When startling information is con
veyed to the readers no matter in what 
form, as a news item or an editorial, 
someone must be responsible for it. 
It is the policy of The Tartan not to 
publish any article for which the con
tributor, whether he is a member of 
the regular editorial staff or not, is 
unwilling to assume the responsibil
ity. Students have frequently request
ed us to write or print a severe criti
cism of an occurrence or action of 
which they disapproved, only to back 
down when told their request would 
be fulfilled on condition that their 
signatures appear under articles. And 
even though we are accused of a seem
ing lack of aggressiveness, we shall 
continue our present policy, which ex
perience has indicated to be a wise 
one. On the other hand, in the few 
discussions Vo have attempted to 
arouse, there has been little response 
from the students. The Tartan may 
occasionally start something but it 
may not always be able to accomplish 
its purpose unassisted.
Have we made ourselves clear? We 
object to starting something unless 
there is good reason for so doing, 
because we are not publishing a yel
low journal. This question is much 
more serious than first thought might 
lead one to believe. Once having 
made a start, it is too late to retract 
and where student co-operation is re
quired, the chances for the successful 
accomplishment of a purpose become 
more difficult.
cvsP fh Pvi SiIIhlS 
PvIIy?
But we are willing to give the stu
dents every opportunity to prove their 
good intentions and to show us we 
have misjudged them in our previous 
remarks. We have decided to try 
again to start something among 
those who should be the most desir
ous to help usthe Seniors. Follow
ing a plan somewhat similar to that 
carried on not long ago at the Univer
sity of Pennsylvania, we submit to the 
members of the Senior classes of the 
four schools a few questions in which 
any prospective graduate ought to be 
interested and regarding which he 
surely has ideas. If each individual 
Senior will take this request to heart 
and favor us with his opinions, we 
believe a large number of valuable 
suggestions for improving the social 
and scholastic character of our college 
life will be obtained. Replies may be 
given to the various school repre
sentatives of The Tartan board or 
they may be sent through the school 
mail to the Editor-in-Chief. Here are 
the questions:
1. What do you regret most in your 
career at Carnegie?
2. What part of it do you value 
most?
3. What do you regard as Carne
gies greatest need?
4. What do you think is the best 
means of developing the Carnegie 
spirit among undergraduates?
5. What is your opinion of the 
course you are studying?
6. How do you think it could be 
improved?

The following editorial appeared in 
last Saturdays issue of The Index. 
It struck us as being particularly ap
plicable to technical school students:
The exasperated policeman who 
arrested the efficiency expert com
mands the best wishes of most of us. 
No disrespect is intended. The expert 
probably is a well-meaning person. 
Most of these efficiency fellows are. 
That is about the best that can be 
said of them. The efficiency expert 
business has been overplayed. In
deed it has become a bore. It is very 
nice to be efficient and one who seeks 
to do more and better work in a short
er time than before is to be commend-* 
ed for intelligent industry. But there 
are other things worth while in life 
besides efficiency. The art of refined 
conversation is far removed from effi
ciency, but to those fortunate enough 
to possess it, it is a treasure beyond 
the price that any hard-headed effi
ciency expert might put upon it. We 
have practically lost it in America in 
our restless and efficient pursuit of 
wealth. There are enough efficiency 
experts to go around now. Perhaps 
we might be just as happy if we had 
less of them and enjoyed a more inti
mate acquaintance with some of the 
less practical but very delightful 
graces of mind that were cultivated in 
an age not so desperately efficient.

One of the most certain measures 
of failure to cope with the require
ments of a large technical question is 
that of procedure from a partisan 
viewpoint. One of the most urgent 
and deserving problems before the 
American nation today is that of our 
merchant marine. It is obvious that 
a question of such magnitude can only 
be adequately solved by some small, 
coherent body of men and that the 
partisan measures so long adopted and 
changed have only served to lead us 
to a state where, as today, our mer
chant ships are not only inferior to 
those of foreign register but vastly 
unserviceable because of their man
agement and paucity. It is gratifying, 
however, to note that precisive steps 
have been taken by the government 
to better these lamentable conditions, 
and in the view of our inferiority in 
merchant marine lines, the Chamber 
of Commerce of the United States has 
presented a plan for the nursing and 
development of our merchant marine. 
The Chamber of Commerce commis
sion, which recently met in Washing
ton, ft C., reported that it believed the 
proposed ship purchase plan by the 
government to be wrong in principle 
and that the only way to establish 
an adequate merchant marine was by 
government financial aid to private 
initiative.
To accomplish such results the com
mission advocated the formation of a 
federal shipping board and a marine 
development company; the board to 
supervise our shipping; the company, 
to advance funds to buyers and build
ers of ships for merchant trade. This

board would be composed of experts 
upon marine shipping relations, and 
being vested with a full control of our 
over-sea shipping, could rapidly draw 
matters to a working basis. One of 
the new features of this plan, and cer
tainly its a most commendable one, 
is that the commission tends to lift 
the whole question out of politics alto
gether and treat it in a wholly non
partisan manner, which is really the 
only way to deal with the question.

In this dear besotted land of hustle,
mucker-millionaires (should say multi
millionaires, of course), and a general 
prevalence of nervous prosperity, 
the babies cut their blessed toofums 
on gold plate or solid silver spoon, and 
absorb enough of the accursed metal 
to plant the madness in their blood.
Is it a wonder then that those who 
make it their business (which is no 
business at all, you know) to wring 
more or less meagre, intellectual divi
dends from the educationally aspiring 
youth, are forever being assailed with 
the nauseous query, whats the use 
of this? Which means, being inter
preted, howr many of those most holy 
dollars can I get in trade for this ab
surd information?
The acquisition of any form of in
formation that is not readily negoti
able for gold, silver, precious stones, 
or a place in the legislature, is re
garded by the average student of En
gineering as a sacreligious waste of 
time. A composite radiograph of too 
many American students would doubt
less show a stomach of Zeppelin pro
portions, and little else except crainal 
contents that resembled specie and 
certificates of stock.
It is a utilitarian age, of course, but 
it is also supposed to be a rational age. 
We are so confounded utilitarian that 
the possession of a prominent wart 
fills us with indignation, not so much 
because it compromises our otherwise 
classical beauty, as because it can be 
put to no profitable use; unless nature 
has been thoughtful enough to dis
pose it so that it may serve as a collar 
button, upon emergency.
You may remember also that, be
sides stomachs, most of us are reputed 
to have what for want of a better 
name may be called souls. Excluded 
from this majority of the souled, of 
course, are the soulless corporation 
lawyer and the captain of finance; also 
the half-souled teacher of mathe
matics). The generosity of this state
ment is not impaired by the fact that 
some have only imitation souls, of 
about the size and consistency of a 
non-eugenic hickory nut.
It is just barely possible then that 
knowledge may have a certain intrins
ic value. That the introduction of it 
into our intellectual interior may be 
attended by agreeable sensations, not 
unlike those physical thrills that at
tend clasping hands under certain age 
and sentimental conditions.
It may be your ambition to acquire 
so much negotiable knowledge along 
one restricted line that you will be 
a sort of self-starting automatic deity 
(on a phlegmatic salary, and under 
switch-board control) to some great 
and good corporation frantic with al
truism,and an unspeakable bow to 
everybody else. You may on the other 
hand, glory be!, desire to become a 
really efficient citizen of this great 
republic, where miscellaneous expec
toration is everywhere prohibited and 
the prohibition seldom enforced (vide, 
Pittsburgh). It is safe to say, per
haps, that no man ever becomes a
really valuable asset to society, who 
knows and cares for only one thing, 
or even for only two or three things.
Much travel is supposed to bring 
culture, savior faire, poise, etc. As a 
matter of fact it often brings to the 
unhappy victims of the visitation a 
pious desire to murder the traveler. 
But that is neither here nor there. The 
acquisition of various kinds of knowl
edge affects the intellectual structure, 
very much as travel affects its surface.
The man who does not travel is apt 
to be provincial and to wear celluloid 
collars; the man who acquires knowl
edge in only one or two lines is in
tellectually provincial and is apt to 
maintain that people who operate a 
gramophone on summer evenings with 
open windows and doors, should not 
be crucified. He is about as human 
or as humanly useful to society as a 
comptometer.
It is reasonably safe to say that no 
form of knowledge is altogether use
less, even if it be nothing better than 
highly specialized information as to 
how work may be discreetly avoided.
It not infrequently happens that in
dividuals who have relentlessly adopt
ed and implacably pursued a certain 
career since they have cut their first 
teeth, find that there is no market for 
their cargo of information along one 
restricted line. They are as guileless 
of other forms of knowledge, as the 
Sahara desert is of watering resorts, 
and the free lunch counters get an
other worshiper.
It is a familiar form of reproach 
hurled at us Americans by the older 
civilizations, that our most sacred 
music is the jingling of coin; and alas, 
for once our superior trans-atlantic 
critics have made a guess that is more 
accurate than the weather reports.
A better and broader civilization is 
begotten of a better and a broader 
education, and that will never evolve 
form such anemic queries, as whats 
the use? at the ratio of 16 to 1. It 
is the almost universal testimony of 
employers that the haughty graduate 
of an engineering school scarcely ever 
hates himself. His chief concern 
seems to be about the salary he will 
deign to accept, and not at all about 
his own efficiency.
He has the idea that if he insists, 
the president will vacate his office, not 
even pausing to secure a box of one 
dollar cigars.
It is worth while to observe that 
about 98 out of every 100 youths, that 
fortune in one of her ironical moods, 
starts at the top, arrive in undignified 
haste and dishevelment at the bot
tom.
Is it not safer and saner to start 
at the bottom and with all your con
stituent parts in their decent and 
proper places, climb as high as you 
may. Of course, $75 per month is a 
miserable, unworthy pittance. It is 
an insult if you like, but it is just 
barely possible that you do not know 
quite everything that is to be known 
in your line. When you are older and 
wiser you may realize that $75 per

You will blush, (at least I hope 
you will) many times before you die,

The jinks is surely following our 
basketball team. With the three de
feats last week, we come up to the 
final stretch with a record of seven 
consecutive losses. Geneva, Juniata, 
and the Alumni trimmed the Varsity 
last week, all by close scores, and in 
hard-fought games; games each of 
which were not decided until the last 
few minutes of play. Time and 
again in games, our opponents will 
ring in the most remarkable shots 
from all angles and from all distances 
and time and again we hear that old 
expression, He never did that be
fore (with apologies to cartoonist 
Goldberg). And again, our boys will 
get all kinds of rimmers; balls that 
will go around the basket two or 
three times and then drop to the 
floor. This is the kind of luck against 
which we have been playing. It is 
said that Fortune always frowns on 
a loser, and she sure has been giving 
Tech her share. But it is a long lane 
that has no turning. Well win a 
game soon if several of the men get 
warmed up and get in the push.
Geneva was met at Beaver Falls 
Wednesday and defeated us 25-23. The 
game wras fast and marked by hard 
playing and Tech led at the end of 
the half, 16-15. McCarter and Buchanon starred for Geneva, while 
Capt. Hines and Levy played best for 
Carnegie.

Friday night at Huntingdon we lost 
one of the most exciting games ever 
seen on that floor in a 27-25 score. 
Overcoming a four-point lead, the 
score in the second half was tied al
most throughout, and the game was 
decided on the last minute on two 
freak plays both of which broke 
against us. With one minute of play, 
Juniata had the ball out of bounds 
and passed in to Baker, who made a 
wild shot at the basket and the ball 
went out of bounds again. The ref
eree returned the ball to Juniata and 
before any one could say Jack Rob
inson, Manbeck had scored a goal 
standing under the basket uncovered. 
The referee had claimed that the ball 
had not been thrown in properly on 
the first play. Both plays happened 
so quickly that scarcely any one was 
responsible for the basket made. Then 
to relate the second play. Immediate
ly following Manbecks goal Hines, 
our most reliable man, got the ball at 
mid floor, took it down to the basket 
and then proceeded to miss one of 
the most heart-breaking shots ever 
seen. The ball rolled around the bas
ket and as it fell to the floor the whis
tle blew, closing the half. Manbeck 
and Fees played best for Juniata,
while Hines again starred for. Tech. 
Henning guarded his man well and 
played his best game of the season. 
Honus Wagner made a big hit with 
the natives and they cheered him so 
long and loud that he was forced to 
stand up and bow his acknowledg
ment, much to the delight of the large 
crowd.

The third and last defeat of the 
week (last because we did not play 
any more games) was inflicted by the 
Alumni; the fact alone takes away 
some of the pangs of defeat. Score, 
49-43t Many of the old stars appeared 
against us and tvhile the play was 
rather friendly on our part in the first 
half the game developed into a regu
lar rough-house in the second session. 
Colvin, the wild man, who was noted 
for his accurate over the fence shoot
ing w'hile playing for us last year, was 
much in evidence. Every kind of a 
shot that he almost invariably missed 
last season went in the ring Saturday 
night. Back hand, over the head, un
der the basket were all alike for 
Puss; he made them all counf, Metheny played a clever game and showed 
that he still can handle the ball with 
the best. Yahres, Douthett, Dave 
Williams, and Leety also showed to 
advantage. For Tech, Hines and Levy 
again starred.

Tech is at last to have an up-to-date 
post office, and the old apology for the 
same, which for years had been located 
in the Industries building, is to be 
discarded. The new office is in the 
Central Building and will be in charge 
of an employee of the institute.
The new mail system will be in 
operation in about a week. It will be 
conducted on the following plan: All 
U. S. mail will be delivered to the 
office and that for the members of 
the faculty will be assorted by the 
man in charge according to school. 
This mail will then be delivered to the 
respective deans offices where it will 
be dealt with, according to the wishes 
of the particular school.
To handle interschool and interde
partment mail there will be a box on 
the main floor of each building, in 
which the members of the faculty may 
place this mail. It will be collected 
three times a day and taken to the 
Central building, where it will be dealt 
with in a similar manner as the U. S. 
mail.
Student mail will be held at the 
booth subject to the call of the stu
dent. Each week a list of unclaimed 
letters will be posted on the Bulletin 
Board at the office and will also be 
printed in this paper. As an attendant 
will be on duty at all times in the 
booth, there should be no difficulty in 
obtaining mail upon its delivery here 
from the Oakland station. Stamps, 
in small denominations will be on sale 
and may be procured in amounts not 
exceeding $1.00.
Since 1907, the University of Illinois 
has maintained ten Research Fellow
ships in their Engineering Experiment 
Station. The work done at this sta
tion is closely related to the College 
of Engineering and covers all branch

may be obtained from the director at 
Urbana, Illinois.

At the Plebe meeting held last 
week, G. R. Holmes was elected Sec
retary to fill the vacancy made by the 
resignation of C. M. Maguire.
Jt Jt Downs was elected manager 
of the Plebe baseball team, and al

would like to arrange games to be 
played with any class or section 
teams.
E. Heyl was elected track manager 
and any Industries Plebe that is in

speak to Heyl as the Plebes expect to 
have a winning track team.
A new system of shop management 
has been introduced in Forge Shop, 
by Mr. Taylor. Each section has 
elected a foreman, to serve for a 
period of two weeks. H.e is to have 
the same duties as a foreman in an 
outside shop.
This system is fast proving popular 
with the fellows, and might well be 
taken up by the other shops, as it 
gives the students an idea as to what 
is expected of a foreman.
Industry Plebes announce the date 
of their dance for March 11, to be

the wholesome respect of the teams 
that are really great.

LECTURE ON PANAMA EXPO
Continued from Page 1 
from a gallery or hall underneath the 
Avail. Many beautiful arches and gates 
pierce this bank of varied colored 
flowers. At night this wall is illumi
nated by many colored electric lights.
The gardens and trees have been 
transplanted in the grounds in boxes 
of earth set in sea sand brought from 
the bay by dredges and pumps. Palms, 
Eucalyptus and Magnolia trees range 
in heights to fifty feet. The beds of 
flowers are gorgeous, being mostly 
rhododendrons, hyacinths, tulips and 
narcissus banked in high mounds.
The buildings are made of imitation 
Travatine stone. The colors are rich 
and have been mellowed down by a 
short exposure to the brilliant sun and 
heavy rains. The columns have been 
painted to represent costly marbles 
and the weather has done its work in 
making them most natural.
A feature Mr. Horbostel noticed 
was a school of guides. A number 
of young men were being lead around
by an instructor and taught the most 
vital points of the exposition. The 
plan of the exposition was conceived 
by Mr. McElroy, who has waited for 
some time to produce such an array 
of art.
The patio is a feature of the plan. 
The exposition as a whole is a large 
rectangle containing three main courts 
flanked by many others. At one end 
a plaza which contains the Fine Arts 
Hall and the other end the Machinery 
Hall. The Court of Nations is won
derful, being flanked on all sides by 
almost every style of architecture.
The Fine Arts Building is magnifi
cent and consists of a main loggia, 
flanked by two semi-circular colon
nades which contain the sculpture. 
The paintings are in galleries under 
terraces covered with trees which 
forms a background for the loggia. 
Mr. Maybeck was the designer of this 
scheme which has worked so well.
The state buildings on a whole are 
fine. Japan has a beautiful exhibit in
cluding a wonderfully planned garden. 
Canadas exhibit is also unique, being 
a complete revue of its resources.
The illumination has never been ex
celled and has many new and novel 
features. For instance, as lofty tower 
known as the Tower of Jewels is 
covered with many polished glass 
prisms which sway in the wind and 
reflect the sun in the many colors of 
the spectrum. At night the search
lights play on these prisms in differ
ent colors which constantly change. 
The lighting in general is indirect and 
hence the spots are eliminated. About 
forty searchlights are so arranged as 
to throw a faw-like aurora in the sky 
which constantly changes color, one 
fading into another. Another feature 
was the mode of producing fireworks 
or rather a substitute. An apparatus 
was arranged to fill bombs with steam 
under compression and shot them in 
the air, where they exploded forming 
fantastic shaped forms upon which
was thrown different colored search
lights. The effect it is said is more 
pleasing than fireworks themselves. 
Smoke rings in colors also form a 
feature of night illumination.
In general the worlds fair is the 
most unique and gorgeous ever at
tempted and has been the work of 
great artists, architects and sculptors. 
Mr. Hornbostel is arranging several 
scholarships to enable the students 
for Carnegie to attend the exposition.
The largest law library in the coun
try is located at Harvard. The Uni
versity of Pennsylvania ranks third 
in size and Yale seventh.
Omitting the summer session, the 
University of Pittsburgh, with an in
crease of 1,069 students over the regis
tration of the fall term of 1913, made 
the largest gain of any of the univer
sities of the United States.
The class of 1915 at Ohio State may 
purchase a Westminster Clock and 
donate it to the school, according to 
the report of the senior memorial com
mittee.
The Green and White of Ohio Uni
versity has issued a special sensation
al paper, containing cracks and 
slams on everything and everybody 
in general about the school.
Wooster students are again the 
victims of a Small Pox scare; so 
speaks the Wooster Voice. The board 
of health has demanded that all stu
dents be vaccinated before attending 
school.
The University of California has a 
correspondence course in scientific 
agriculture which is being taken by 
mail by over 6,000 ambitious farmers. 
There are more enrolled in corres
pondence courses than in regular uni
versity work.

On last Friday evening, February 
26th, the Sophomores of the Science 
school gave an informal dance at the 
Carnegie Union. Invitations were ex
tended to upper classmen and Plebes.
In the opinion of those who attend
ed, the dance was the best affair of 
its kind held in the school this year. 
Dancing continued from nine until 
one-thirty. Twenty-eight numbers 
were danced.
The music played in such a lively, 
pleasing manner by Nirellas Orches
tra, enabled everyone to have a good 
time. In fact, the music was so well 
chosen and rendered, that no one 
could sit out a dance even at the end. 
The punch to the music lasted 
throughout.
Several original special dances 
which produced much amusement 
were arranged by the committee, and 
favors were given to the successful 
dancers. The evening was so delight
fully spent, that all those present are 
looking forward to the next Soph, 
affair, which will be given early in the 
spring.
The committee on arrangements 
consisted of C. B. Schumacher^ chair
man; L. H. Rowe, D. A. Curtis, C. V. 
Doherty, H. A. Weber, W. Wilson.
The Southern Club held its regular 
semi-monthly meeting last Wednes
day, when it was decided to hold a

lowing men were appointed as a com
mittee to attend to details: W. F.
Diehl, Md.; T. Cooley, Va.; O. J. 
Southwell, Tex. All men from below 
Mason and Dixons Line are urged 
to come around and hear the English 
language spoken as it should be, and 
become members. Names may be 
handed to E. Crump, Jr., Senior Archi

mercial.
The new department of business ad
ministration and banking at Colora

The authorities at McGill Univer

The foreign enrollment at the Uni
versity of Pennsylvania for 1914-15 is
25 per cent less than for 1913-14. The 
decrease is attributed to the war con
ditions prevailing in most of the for
eign countries at the present time,

The Carnegie Economical Society 
announced itself to the public Friday 
evening, Feb. 19, by taking an official 
part in the vigorous anti-military 
movement that is sweeping over the 
country.
In conjunction with the University 
of Pittsburgh and the Pennsylvania 
College for Women, an anti-military 
meeting was held at the Lecture Hall 
of the Carnegie Institute. A large 
number of people were present to lis
ten to the four speakers. Dr. Day, of
C. I. T., was chairman of the meeting. 
The first speaker was Dr. Atcheson, 
President of the Pennsylvania Col
lege for Women, who delivered an ex
cellent address. He said that war was 
the most furious and futile of mans 
activities; that ultimately it could be 
stopped; and that ultimately it would 
be stopped. The futility and meaning 
of war is illustrated on the battlefields 
of Europe. In speaking of armed peace 
he said, It was a lie, and all who said 
it assured peace knew it was a lie! 
Continuing, he said that Europe ex
ploded because Europe was loaded. 
This war and militarism is out of 
keeping with the spirit of American 
education. The peace man has too 
long been called the impractical ideal
ist, and the military man has too long 
been called the hero. The hero should 
be he who adds a substantial contribu
tion to the worlds progress. The sec
ond speaker was Chancellor MacCormick, of the University of Pittsburgh, 
who, in an interesting address, said 
that he was surprised to see so many 
people seeking knowledge on the sub
ject being discussed. We are a nation 
which is face to face with the policy 
that it is to follow. It is our business 
to know where we stand we stand on 
this question and why we stand there. 
We must decide that war will not be 
the policy of America. It is not easy 
for a man to make this assertion be
fore people, but we must do it.
The third speaker introduced, was 
Professor Willet, of C. I. T., who dis
cussed the interesting question Is 
there any condition on the other side 
that justifies the impression that we 
should increase our army? General 
Miles, and ex-Secretary of the Navy,

ANTI-MILITARY MEETING
Continued from Page 7 
Myers, are both advocates of almost 
impossible armament. Prof. Willet 
said that if we decide to treat other 
nations in a perfectly fair way we will 
be treated the same. He cited the 
Venezuela Incident as an example of 
this. Other nations know that we are 
the one powerful nation that is not 
grasping. We need not fear invasion 
so much, for we are separated by three 
thousand miles of water from those 
nations of which we are so afraid. Be
sides, they are so afraid of each other 
that it has prevented trouble with us. 
When this war is over, the position of 
the United States will be safer than 
ever, and we are hoping that it will 
introduce a rational system of hand
ling international questions. It is hard 
to see how a nation so hopelessly de
voted to peace and industry as is ours, 
should submit to the squandering of 
public funds for armament. If we 
show a decent respect for other na
tions and mind our own business we 
have nothing to fear. This question, 
unlike many others, is one on which 
every man can give an intelligent deci
sion.
Dr. Levy gare a very convincing 
argument against militarism. He said 
that war was contrary to religion. If 
ever Jesus was crucified, he has been 
ten thousand times more crucified by 
the Christians today on the battle
fields of Europe. He also stated that 
war was contrary to morals. We must 
keep our word of honor. Yet we are 
told that treaties are only scraps of 
paper, and all is fair in war. We can
not establish the morality of warfare. 
War has shown itself wrong from a 
standpoint of sociology for through it, 
friends and families have been made 
enemies. Militarism or war has shown 
itself wrong from the standpoint of 
economics. Countries of weak arma
ment have just as great industrial op
portunities as those of extensive arma
ment. This fact is brought home 
when we notice that the bonds of the 
weakest countries have the highest 
value. The slogan of the battlefield 
is destruction first, while that of the 
industrial world is Safety First.
At the end of the meeting, Dr. Day 
read the following resolution:
Resolved, That we, the students of 
the Carnegie Institute of Technology, 
University of Pittsburgh, and the 
Pennsylvania College for Women, in 
public assembled, hereby go on rec
ord before Congress and the people of 
the United States as favoring the sub
stitution of peaceful methods for solv
ing international questions for war, 
and as opposed to any increase of the 
army and navy of the United States.
This resolution was carried unani
mously.
The meeting as a whole was ex
tremely interesting and well worth the 
expense, time and energy that must 
have been expended in its promotion. 
Handbills containing vigorous pro
tests against war and militarism were 
distributed through the audience.
The cadets of the Iowa State col
lege will be required to attend the 
summer camp for six days during 
Commencement week. During this 
time the corps will be under strict 
military discipline and will receive a 
thorough and practical course of in
struction in all camp duties, field 
maneuvers, and military regulations. 
This is an entirely new feature of the 
military department.
