TO STAGE PIA'
Part of Red Cross Campaign. 
Other Activities To Assist.
The final step in the comprehensive 
campaign entered into by the students 
and faculty of Tech for the relief of 
the suffering populations in Belgium, 
Servia, Poland and Armenia was taken 
last week when the War Relief Com
mittee, meeting with its chairman, 
Professor Norman C. Riggs, professor 
of Mechanics, School of Applied Sci
ence, in the Margaret Morrison Car
negie School, authorized the holding 
of a big benefit performance at the 
Schenley Theater, Thursday evening, 
February 24th, in which the Depart
ment of Dramatic Arts of the School 
of Applied Design will play the prin
cipal part as performers, aided and 
abetted by various Tech student activi
ties such as the Choral Club, the Sym
phony Orchestra and the Musical 
Clubs. The prices for the evenings 
entertainment will run from one dol
lar down to twenty-five cents and the 
tickets therefor will be placed on sale 
in the near future as part of a cam
paign and plan of money-raising now 
being worked out by Mr. H. J. McCorkle, secretary to the dean of the 
School of Applied Science.
In the months time between the an
nouncement of the deed and the doing 
of it, every student of Tech, man, 
woman, and child, youn gand old, rich 
and poor, will be called upon to make 
successful the most extraordinary, sig
nificant, generous, and philanthropic 
undertaking yet to be entered into by 
the collective mass of students on the 
campus of Carnegie Tech. At an 
early date in the campaign for funds, 
inspired by the promptings of an al

Concerts Given in Four Cities.
During the week past, the com
bined Musical Clubs of Tech gave 
concerts at Oil City, Pa., Jamestown, 
N. Y., Erie, Pa., and Ashtabula, Ohio, 
in the order named. Each concert was 
an entire success from every stand
point. Not only were the fellows en
tertained royally but the entertain
ments were complete successes, and 
received with great appreciation in 
every city.
The Clubs opened at Oil City on 
Tuesday night at the Opera House 
to a very large audience, and although 
the program was a little upset by the 
committee in charge in that town, the 
people received each number with 
calls for encores. Every one seemed 
to be on edge for a complete triumph 
and no one was disappointed. Right 
now it might be said for every one of 
the cities visited that the fellows 
lacked for nothing in hospitality. 
Everyone seemed anxious to help out 
and at no place was there any trouble 
in placing men for food and shelter. 
The open hand and the well filled 
board were constantly at our demand. 
Every man played his part as a gentleContinued on Page 2
FIRST HOCKEY GAME LOST. 
Excellent Possibilities in Tech Team.
Tdch opened its hockey season in 
the local league Saturday, January 
29, with the P. A. A. team, and suf
fered a 4-0 defeat. The game was not 
particularly fast, but was closer than 
the score signified, Tech having the 
puck in P. A. A territory much of the 
time. However, poor shooting and 
poor team play, all resulting from the 
lack of practice, prevented our taking 
advantage of our opportunities. P. 
A. A. had an excellent defense which 
we did not.
One was much impressed with the 
latent possibilities in the team. With 
more practice it is most possible that 
this defeat could easily be avenged, 
as there are several speedy skaters 
on the Plaid seven. Julien and Edons are both hard and fast skaters 
and very good on carrying and re
covering the puck. Wilson is a good 
skater, but needs practice in shooting. 
Merrill has been working hard at 
goal, a new position for him, and is 
doing very well.
The line-up for Tech: Goal, Mer
rill; point, Masters; cover point, Ed
ens; rover, Cook; wings, Julien and 
Wilson; center, Norman.
PRIZES OFFERED ON DESIGN 
FOR ALUMNI RING.
Visitors Show Excellent Form.
The friends of the Tech passers 
who attended the contest with Col
gate had an opportunity to witness 
some of the best offensive and defen
sive play that has ever been pulled 
off on the Tech floor. After losing 
to Pitt the night before by the hold
up method, the Colgate men entered 
the game with our representatives 
with a determination to win. And, 
they did! Not only was their passing 
and shooting both accurate and fast, 
but also they prohibited our passers 
from scoring enough points to even 
make the few visiting rooters feel 
nervous over the outcome. Tech 
started the contest with Pick Hines 
out of the game and his services were 
missed very much, not only as guard, 
but also as foul shooter. He was put 
in near the end of the first half and 
from that time till the end of the con
test, we succeeded in holding the vis
itors even. Kennedy and Stewart led 
in the playing for Colgate, while Hines 
and Tumpane starred for the Plaid. 
The score at the end of the first half 
was 23-6 and at the end of the game 
was 43-26, each team scoring 20 points

OPPONENTS ON FLOOR.
All Degree Students Are Eligible for 
Competition.
The several schools of Carnegie 
have united at last in an effort to 
standardize the senior ring or rather 
the alumnus ring of this school. The 
committee on this project has met 
and decided to hold a competition. 
The program will be held to the word.
It has been decided that Tech has 
reached a point in its development 
where a standard ring for all degree 
students is necessary. This ring to 
take the place of the various Senior 
class rings as adopted differently by 
the various schools each year.
A ring symbolic of the Institution 
is the subject of this competition. 
Required of Subject:
1. That the symbols shall represent 
the entire Institution or a combination 
of all the degree courses.
2. That a space be reserved for the 
class numerals and school letters, that 
is, A. D., A. S., etc.
3. That the ring be distinctive from 
the seal rings of State and other simi
lar institutions.
Continued on Page 3
On next Saturday night, the follow
ers of the Plaid will have the oppor
tunity of seeing what promises to be 
a fast and hard-fought game between 
the Tech five and the representatives 
of Grove City College. Grove City 
has, thus far, made a good record on 
the floor and, from all reports, the 
home team will have to uncover a 
better line of attacw- and defense in 
order to come out victors in the con
test. But, it is to be expected that 
they will do this. Capt. Hines will 
probably be back in the line-up and 
will aid materially with his all-around 
floor work and excellent foul shoot
ing. Coach Nickels has been working 
the men hard and will continue to do 
so right up until Friday night in order 
to get the men in readiness for the 
Grove City game and also the three 
games in the east next week. Drastic 
measures are being taken to eliminate 
the pugilistic spirit among the players 
and will be a success at any cost. 
From now on, followers of the Plaid 
may rest assured that the basketball 
will come up to the standard of Tech 
athletics both in cleanliness and vic
tories.

PITTSBURGH, PA., FEB. 9, 1916
A STANDARD INSIGNIA.
Action has been taken to establish 
a design for a standard senior ring. 
The need of such has been long felt. 
The use of a new design every year 
is in the first place troublesome; in 
the second, expensive; in the third, 
it is usually of a poor design, and 
lastly, it lacks the uniformity there 
should be with all the rings and in
signias of the graduates of a school.
The new movement is handled by 
a committee from every class, in the 
four schools, which awards a design 
The committee has prepared a pro
gram on a competition for a design 
of the ring. Prizes will be offered. 
The conditions will be stated in an
other column. It will be wise for 
every one to take advantage of this 
competition for two reasons,first, 
duty to your school, and secondly, 
the cash recompense for your work if 
it justifies an award.
It is to be understood each ring will 
have the class numerals engraved on 
the standard design. The great ad
vantage in a distinctive ring for a 
graduate is the possession of a degree 
which will be recognizable by other 
graduates and by the world at large. 
Standardization is a keynote in this 
generation and we need it in the mat
ter of a Senior ring.
A NEW PUBLICATION.
Tech has another publication which 
is worthy of note. The new Architec
tural book to be published by the 
Tech Architectural Club is something 
new to this school. The work is to be
something new and novel in its line.
The aim of the publication is to in
terest and aid the student more in his 
endeavor for attainments in his pro
fession and interest the practicing 
architects in this department of the 
school. The need of bringing the 
practicing architect and student in 
closer relation has long been felt by 
both. The need of a medium beside 
our annual catalog and bulletin for 
publishing the work of our depart
ment will be supplanted by this book. 
It will be used by the department as 
the official bulletin of information.
There will be only one issue this 
year. Starting next year it will be 
issued as a quarterly. The book will 
contain, as stated above, work of the 
architectural department, the best 
works of architects, and articles of in
terest to the profession. The plate 
system as used in all large architec
tural magazines will be followed.
The Club has arranged for an ex
hibition of work in the Carnegie Art 
Galleries to precede the issue of this 
year, to which the architects of the 
city will be invited to attend and get 
acquainted with our department.
A GENERAL ASSEMBLY.
Even though the second semester 
has already been inaugurated, it does 
not seem inopportune to offer a sug
gestion for the consideration of the 
proper authorities, which has been on 
our mind for some time.
It does not require a too keen ob
server to see that there is something 
lacking in the inter-relationship of the 
four schools which form the Carnegie 
Institute of Technology. There is a 
certain spirit of college fraternalism 
and sympathetic understanding which, 
unfortunately, is present between the 
schools in a negligible degree. Such 
an atmosphere cannot T>ut breed feel
ings of unfriendliness and jealousy, 
and unless alleviated, prove seriously 
detrimental to the Institute.
One of the main causes of this atti
tude is the lack of opportunity for the 
students of the different schools to 
meet and learn to know one another. 
Excepting at athletic events or on 
such occasions as Carnegie Day, etc., 
we are never seen collectively. About 
the only thing we have in common is 
the fact that we all attend some 
school in the group known as the Car
negie Institute of Technology, which 
schools are situated in close proxim
ity to one another. Other than that 
and athletics there are no duties or 
occasions requiring our co-operation. 
We even find it difficult to call mass 
meetings because the schools are ap
pealed to individually.
The source of alleviation and cure 
of this misunderstanding and es
trangement may be found, in our opin
ion, in a general assembly to be held 
once a week, say Friday mornings, 
from 8:30 to 9:30 or 1:30 to 2:30 in 
the afternoons, at some place large 
enough to accommodate us all, say, 
for instance, at Carnegie Music Hall. 
Attractive programs could be ar
ranged to drive home the lessons in 
co-operation and humanity we all of 
us need so much.
Any infringement of schedule this
would cause could be easily repaired 
and, if, at first, it would cause incon
venience, the efforts would be amply 
repaid by the stimulus to the sense of 
faithfulness and friendship of one 
Carnegie Tech student to the other 
and of all to their future Alma Mater.
Lets think it over, Messrs Authori
ties.

MUSICAL CLUBS TRIP
Continued from Page 1 
man and Carnegie Institute of Tech
nology can well be proud of Its Musi
cal Clubs. The railroad connections 
were well planned and a special was 
provided all the way round. None of 
the ordinary details generally forgot
ten were lacking and there was not a 
single slip up of any kind on the trip.
At Jamestown, on Wednesday even
ing, in the Northern Club auditorium, 
the boys outdid themselves in a con
cert probably never surpassed by any 
Carnegie Tech Musical Club. Again 
enough could not be said about the 
hospitable treatment accorded the fel
lows. Here the clubs realized that 
they had not prepared enough en
cores. Special mention should be giv
en Mr. Scalzos mandolin solo work 
which received an ovation for playing. 
He left the clubs at Jamestown, being 
called back to Pittsburgh, and while at 
the next two concerts his leadership 
was very greatly missed, the Man
dolin Club displayed great ability and 
preparation and delighted their audi
ences at every number.
At Erie, Pa., the slight doubt ex
pressed as to the success of the con
cert owing to the loss of Mr. Scalzos 
leadership was set at naught and the 
fine training he had given them 
showed itself by the applause of a 
large appreciative audience attending 
at the High School Auditorium. There 
were enough Tech men in the seats 
here to allow the use of an accenter 
between clubs and the audience. 
Again the hospitality shown was the 
kind that maketh glad the heart of 
man and warmeth his memories of 
home.
In the High School Auditorium at 
Ashtabula Harbor a repetition of for
mer successes delighted a very large 
audience. Here the Mandolin Club 
showed its versatility by producing 
several very laughable situations in a 
really witty comedy, which were great
ly appreciated. It was with deep re
grets the boys left the kind homes of 
Ashtabula Harbor and set their faces

toward Pittsburgh and the "xamination reports.
At every city favorable comment 
was constantly being made on not 
only the concerts but the action of the 
fellows, themselves. Carnegie Tech 
may well feel proud of its Musical 
Clubs for nowhere was there a single 
adverse criticism to either the pro
gram or the men, and the repeated in
vitations to come again give us a rec
ommendation well worth bearing in 
mind.

PENN STATE WINNERS IN 
ROUGH CONTEST.
Capt. Hines Out of Game With Grippe
With Captain Hines out of the game 
because of illness the Tech five suf
fered defeat at the hands of State, 35- 
24. It was easily seen at the start of 
the contest that the home five did not 
pull together nor have the usual fast 
attack that helped to pull ahead in the 
first few contests of the season. As 
usual, however, the second half proved 
to be Techs half, outscoring the vis
itors 11-9.
The contest was marred throughout 
by rough playing and, altogether, four 
men were expelled from the contest. 
In the first few minutes of the second 
half Nig Findlay and Blakeslee of 
State got into a fistical argument and 
gave a clever exhibition in the art of 
pugilism. It was fierce while it lasted 
and it required the efforts of all the 
players of both teams to separate 
them. Referee Mauthe expelled both 
men and J. Meredith was substituted 
for Findlay and put up an excellent 
exhibition of basketball. The expul
sion of Blakeslee from the State line
up proved a blow to the State com
bination. His excellent foul shooting 
and all-around playing helped State 
to acquire the big lead in the first 
half. The Plaid five crept steadily up 
and at one time were within seven 
points of tying the visitors, but the 
State aggregation braced for the few 
remaining minutes of the game and 
the final whistle blew with Tech 11 
points behind. Lewis was expelled 
for coming to blows with his man and 
Walton of Penn State was put out for 
tripping. The line-up:

TEAM STANDING IN BASKET
BALL LEAGUES. 
Close Race For Supremacy in Many 
Cases.
As a new adventure the establish
ment of three basketball leagues in 
school has been very successful. Much 
interest has been taken by the oppos
ing teams and some of the basketball 
played might be a true cause for mak
ing the varsity feel just a little shaky. 
On the other hand some of the games 
are classics on account of the lack 
of basketball. To walk by the gym. 
on the night of a game and hear the 
discord inside one wonders why the 
never came off. The games have 
proved an interest to all concerned 
and afford excellent opportunities for 
the fellows to get all the exercise they 
want. Many of the games have been 
very close and every team standing 
high has had to put forth its best to 
reach whatever height it has obtained.

REV. HUGH THOMSON KERR 
TO ADDRESS Y. M. C. A.
Everybody Invited To Attend Meet
ing Next Sunday.
Under the auspices of the Y. M. C. 
A., Rev. Hugh Thomson Kerr, pastor 
of the Shadyside Presbyterian Church, 
will deliver an address to the students 
in Room 104 A. I. next Sunday after
noon. This opportunity to hear Rev. 
Kerr will surely be a great treat for 
all. A great many of the students 
accepted the invitation of the Shadyside Presbyterian Church one Sunday 
evening last fall and heard Rev. Kerr 
preach a sermon which will seldom be 
excelled. The interest which he has 
taken in the welfare of Tech students 
has always been most marked and we 
feel most fortunate in having such a 
man to speak to us. We urge every 
one to come next Sunday afternoon 
and we guarantee that they will find 
their time has been most profitably 
spent. It is to be hoped that all who
can will come. Remember, fellows, 
it will be in Room 104 A. I. at 3:15 
and be sure to avail yourself of the 
good opportunity of hearing him.
BASKETBALL MEN TO TAKE 
EASTERN TRIP.
Manager Ammerman and Coach 
Nickels will take the varsity men into 
the east next week, where some of the 
fastest teams of the country will be 
met. They will leave Tuesday even
ing and play Cornell at Ithaca on 
Wednesday night. From Ithaca the} 
will proceed to Colgate and try to 
make amends for what happened on 
our floor. After playing Colgate Fri
day night, the team will go to Buffalo 
to play the University here and re
turn to Pittsburgh sometime on Sun
day. The trip promises to be a good 
one from many viewpoints and those 
who are fortunate enough to make it 
are to be congratulated. All are very 
grateful to the manager for making 
such a good schedule and especially 
such a big eastern trip.

REGULAR ASSEMBLY.
At the regular Wednesday Assem
bly, Dean Breed presided. An import
ant notice was made to the effect, that 
the Seniors scheduled for the two 
credit course in Letters, would only 
be required to take one credit; while 
those, scheduled for the one credit 
course would be excused when suffi
cient improvement had been made. 
Dean Breed cited Miss Parry as the 
chief one responsible for the change, 
and so to her the Seniors wish to ex
tend their heartfelt thanks.
Announcements were followed by a 
short talk by Miss Breed, who em
phasized the necessity of calmness in 
important decisions, and the need of 
putting aside all disturbing prejudices. 
She urged us all to live up to the best 
moments of our lives, when we really 
do rise above our ordinary selves and 
become something big and good in 
this world. Several lines from Mat
thew Arnold were quoted which bore 
directly upon this thought, and which 
were very inspiring.
ALPHA PSI DANCE.
TYPEWRITING EXHIBITION.
On Tuesday, January 25, 1916, the 
faculty and students of Margaret 
Morrison had the honor of witness
ing a typewriting exhibition given by 
Miss Margaret Owen, the worlds 
champion typist. What seemed most 
marvelous in her exhibition was the 
fact that, while carrying on a conver
sation, she was able to write, with no 
errors, 140 words per minute.
By the way the Soph. Secretarial 
girls are working since this exhibition,
one might think they were planning 
to enter the contest in New York 
irext year.
PLEBE PARTY AT DORM.
GUILD MEETING.
January 28, the Alpha Psi Sorority 
gave a dance to which the active mem
bers of each sorority in the Pan Hel
lenic Association of M. M C. S. wrre 
invited. A very gooi representation 
of each sorority, was present at the 
affair which was held in Recreation 
Hall. The decorative scheme was 
carried out with the aid of palms, ban
ners, ?nd shaded lights which gave the 
hall a very attractive pink glow. 
Unusually good music was a feature, 
and refreshments were available dur
ing the whole evening. The grand 
march occurred in the middle of the 
program, and was led by Miss Ruth 
Patterson and her guest. As the 
guests passed a small table, favors 
were presented, consisting of small 
strips of paper which exploded as they 
were pulled apart, and paper caps. 
Miss Ernst and Miss Dixon chaper
oned the dance. The spirit of the 
Alpha Psis in giving it for the benefit 
of other than their own members was 
very commendable, and was thorough
ly appreciated by the members of the 
other sororities.
PARTY FOR SENIORS.
Miss Mary Loomis entertained the 
Seniors of the Special Methods Class 
in Cooking, to celebrate the end of 
the semester. The party took place at 
Miss Loomis home in Swissvale on 
Thursday evening, January 27th. 
Nearly all the girls were present and 
had a wondrously happy and care
free time. At that time it was decided 
that the Senior Class as a whole would 
adjourn to Camp Louise Carnegie for 
a week after Commencement, in order 
to have one last good time together, 
and to recuperate after the arduous 
trials of a Seniors life.
At the close of the evening, refresh
ments were served and all departed 
after having had a most delightful 
time.
The Delta Delta Sorority enter
tained with a theater party at the 
Nixon, on Saturday, January 29th. 
Every one had a most delightful time 
and thoroughly enjoyed the perform
ance.
FIFTH AYE. DORM. DANCE.
The Plebes of the Morewood Dorm, 
held a surprise party on Friday even
ing, February 4, in honor of Miss 
Dorothy Snively, who is leaving for 
her home in Waynesboro in a couple 
of weeks. Dancing and cards were 
the features of the evening. Refresh
ments were served about 10:30. The 
favors were valentine hearts filled 
with candy. The party broke up 
about 12 oclock, everybody reporting 
an enjoyable time.
Friday evening, the girls of the Fifth 
Ave. Dorm, entertained with a dance. 
There were about 25 couples present 
and every one had a most delightful 
time. The best ever was the verdict 
given at the close of the evening. Miss 
Marvin was the chaperone, while the 
committee in charge included Miss 
Edith Gurley, chairman, Miss Mary 
Truman, and Miss Sharpley. The 
committee deserves considerable cred
it for the successful outcome of the 
evening; especially are the enthusiasm 
and energy of the chairman to be 
commented on
SOPHOMORE CLASS MEETING.
At a meeting of the Guild held 
Tuesday, February 1, the following 
business took place: The report of
the Secretary; the report of the Treas
urer, which showed that $137.67 were 
cleared at the Christmas festival. It 
was voted that the presidents of the 
different organizations be interviewed 
and a decision made on the division 
of this money. It was voted that the 
Guild social service committee inves
tigate the different charitable insti
tutions of the City in order that the 
Guild might spend its share of this 
money wisely. Officers were elected 
for the following year as follows:
President, Frances Willis.
Vice President, Florence Grier.
Secretary, Helen Senn.
Treasurer. Florence Bestel.
Miss Sanford, the retiring president, 
has filled that position very capably, 
it was largely due to her untiring ef
forts that the Xmas festival was such 
a success, and altogether she has car
ried the Guild through a very success
ful year. Miss Willis, the new presi
dent, has shown her ability along sev
eral lines and there is no doubt that 
the Guilds coming year will also be 
a very successful one.
At a meeting of the Sophomore 
class, Miss Florence Bechtel was 
elected president to fill the vacancy 
left by Miss Janet Mandell. Miss 
Mandell has left Margaret Morrison, 
to continue her studies at Pitt. The 
reason for her so doing, was the nec
essity for taking Physiology, Bacter
iology, Dietetics and other subjects 
which would be of special use to her, 
as she expects to enter the West Penn 
Hospital in the fall to take the train
ing preparatory to the nursing pro
fession.
Miss Mandell was the head of Bas
ketball, being an excellent player her
self, taking a very great interest in 
athletics and standing high in her 
gym. work. We shall greatly miss 
her.
In Miss Bechtel, however, the class 
feels they have found a worthy suc
cessor to Miss Mandell; one who will 
take an interest in the running and 
directing of the class activities.

MR. SINGER TALKS TO NIGHT 
ELECTRICIANS.
Mr. F. K. Singer, superintendent of 
maintenance for the Central District 
Telephone Company, addressed the 
students of the night classes in tele
phony and electric light and power 
wiring, Wednesday evening. His sub
ject was, Your Job: How to Get 
Ready for It; How to Get After It; 
How to Hold It.
The address was entertaining, in
structive and impressive, and we only 
regret that lack of space, to say noth
ing of lack of ability, prevents us 
from giving a suitable review of it. 
One general impression was that it 
is getting harder every day for the 
loafer and the four-flusher to bluff 
his pay through this old world, and 
that employers are more and more 
demanding that the workers do some
thing outside of working hours to 
prepare themselves for promotion in
stead of simply waiting for a vacancy 
to occur to automatically boost them 
into a better job. In fact, from the 
compliments paid to the merits of the 
numerous Tech men in the telephone 
companies ranks it would seem like
ly that a live wire from the mining 
classes in Tech would get the best 
job while the stay-at-home was 
watchfully waiting.
Come again, Mr. Singer, we like 
these plain talks from practical busi
ness men.
Jimmy Duffy and Harold Rowan, 
Boston College track stars for three 
years, will not enter competition this 
season. Both have decided that their 
studies this year require much time 
that would be devoted to track work.
Many of our cares are but a mor
bid way of looking at our privi

ALL INVITED
Excellent Performance by Night Stu
dents.
The students of the Evening School 
of the Department of Dramatic Art 
gave their first public performance, 
on Wednesday evening, February 2, 
in the theater of the School of Ap
plied Design, before a large audience, 
which attested its appreciation by its 
applause.
They had in Lord Dunsanys Tents 
of the Arabs a vehicle of unusual 
beauty, so far as its literary value is 
concerned; it ranks with Yeates1, 
Kings Threshold, the only tiling 
ever given on the Design stage with 
which it may be compared, and it 
is only fair to say, that on the whole, 
it was given with as nice a sense of 
value as the Yeats play.
In it one finds the old story of 
mans discontent with his present es
tatethe kings longing for the free
dom of the desert and the camel driv
ers desire to sit upon a throne and 
the transition is very simply accom
plished to the satisfaction of both.
Mr. M. D. Brown, as the king, read 
his lines with poetic feeling, and in a 
well modulated voice which carried 
to the last row in the house, not a 
word being lost. He merged his own 
personality into this unwilling wearer 
of a crown, most successfully and lent 
to the character a quiet glow quite 
in sympathy with the oriental tem
perament as one imagines it. His 
work was unquestionably the most 
artistic in the production, although 
Miss Dorothy Rubenstein made a 
very good foil as Eznarza the des
ert gypsy who engages his fancy. She 
is fair to look upon, has a pleasant 
voice which she uses with discretion, 
and is careful not to over-act. One 
felt that there was just a trifle too 
much repression on her part for a pas
sionate gypsythat the character 
lacked the freedom and abandon one 
might expect in a dweller in tents. 
However, if not perfectly sure of her 
powers, she evinced good taste in 
avoiding the melo-dramatic, which is 
always to be deplored.
Mr. Jerome Lonergan, as Bel Narb, 
read his lines distinctly and with a 
quality of voice quite indicative of his 
disgust with his destiny and the inscrutiable ways of Providence in not 
having made him a king. His role 
afforded very little opportunity for 
acting.
This Oriental Idyl was followed by 
Lady Gregorys comedy Spreading 
the News, making a rather too sharp 
contrast in the evenings bill. One 
felt the jolt from the sublime to the 
ridiculous, but it sent the audience 
home in a very pleasant humor.
Mr. A. MacLean, Jr. (who made a 
very sorry chamberlain in the first 
play), redeemed himself here as the 
pessimistic Bartley Fallow on whom 
the doom of all the ages appeared to 
rest. He and Mrs. Fallow (Miss 
Mea Sweeny) were the most inter
esting members of this cast, affording 
just the contrast the author intended.
Taking the Hibernian melee that 
followed the news of Jack Smiths un
timely demise, one may dispose of the 
cast in a single statement. Celtic 
(Anglicized) flowed freely accompan
ied with every style of jesture, while 
the Titian locks of the various dis
putants supplied the needed note of 
color, and the house shrieked with 
delight. God loves the Irish and so 
does the play-going public.
Altogether the students of the Even
ing School may feel that, considering 
their limitations so far as time and 
opportunity for rehearsal, etc., are 
concerned, they gave a very accept
able performance and that in the mat
ter of diction, a very important item, 
they have not been surpassed in any 
production that has been presented on 
the Design stage. Their public finds 
them interesting because of seeming 
latent possibilities.

MECHANICALS ON INSPECTION 
TRIP.
Trip Included Butler, New Castle, 
Youngstown and Cleveland.
On Monday morning, January 31st, 
about twenty Junior and Senior Me
chanicals started on an inspection trip, 
their first stop being Butler. The 
Standard Plate Glass Works were in
spected at Butler. The only incident 
of particular note that occurred here 
being a discussion as to whether or 
not Whity should tip the waitress. 
It is not certain what the result of the 
discussion was, but in all probability 
the item was entered on the swindle 
sheet.
In New Castle the Pennsylvania 
Engineering Works were visited. This 
plant was of particular interest inso
far as the production of steel works 
equipment was of value to the steel 
works engineers. In New Castle the 
first signs of that instinctive spirit of 
collection was evidenced, as a re
sult the New Castle Depot has not 
quite as complete an equipment of 
signs. It was also learned by one or 
two members of the inspecting party 
that shingles do not always indicate 
places of business. Appearances are 
deceptve, especially empty saloons in 
a dry town.
The Republic Rubber Works and 
the Youngstown Fireproofing Com
pany were inspected in Youngstown, 
the rubber concern was very interest
ing, and the party guided by a Car
negie Tech graduate learned a great 
deal in going through this plant. Cavett shouldered heavy responsibilities 
in procuring the evenings entertain
ment for some of the party. How
ever, his choice received the utmost 
approval of the entire party and the 
most particular endorsement from Mr. 
Blaisdell. Baker, during the same 
evening, learned some new possibili
ties of the syphon bottle when placed 
in the hands of an incompetent oper
ator. The latter reference is not to 
be taken as being to any member of 
the party, but refers to the ringer of 
the cash register.
At Cleveland the following plants 
were visited, the White Automobile 
Company, the Brown Hoisting Mach
inery Company, F. B. Stearns Com
pany, the Warner and Swasey Co., 
and the Ferro Machine and Foundry 
Co. The Warner Swasey Co. is the 
firm which is making the body for the 
telescope of which our Uncle Brashear is making the mirror.
The Cleveland Traction Company 
furnished more or less entertainment 
for the party. The main idea of the 
Cleveland street cars does not seem 
to be to take on passengers or rather 
prospective passengers, but to further 
the progress of the car at as nearly 
the time when half of the people are 
on as possible. Baker experimentally
determined the price of a window of 
one of these same street cars. A 
theatre party was held at one of 
the leading theatres of Cleveland.
The inspection trip was in charge of 
Mr. Blaisdell as far as Youngstown. 
Mr. J. C. Sproull conducted the party 
in Cleveland. The inspection visit 
was enjoyed very much and proved a 
great success.
PLEBE SCIENCE DANCE.
The Plebe dance will be held on 
Friday, February 11th, at 8:30 P. M., 
,(or thereabouts) in Carnegie Union. 
The Sophomore class has been in
vited and preparations have been 
made for a large evening. Mr. and 
Mrs. Harris, Mr. and Mrs. Doyle, and 
Mr. and Mrs. Stanton will be pres
ent. The music will be furnished by 
the well-known G. Oliver Riehl Or
chestra. A slight irregularity has 
been provided to take the place of the 
tenth dance. The committee (Har
rison, Alcorn, Faville) have also ar
ranged to provide for the large num
ber which are expected to be present.
This is the second time the Plebes 
have lifted their weary eyes from 
their books to more pleasant sights. 
The Plebe class are endeavoring to 
become better acquainted with their 
fellow students, and their friends. As 
is generally the case with Plebe 
classes, the members are strangers to 
themselves and their upper-classmen. 
It is hoped that this dance will in 
some measure bring about a closer re
lation between faculty, upper-class
men and Plebes.
Design School News
FOR DESIGN GIRLS.
Out of the quiet of Dean Bossanges 
office has come the best news for 
Design girls this year. Miss Bennet is the good fairy who thought out 
the plans and Mr. Bossange the ma
gician who will allow them to come 
to passif the girls help.
An appropriation for the girls in 
Design has been made so that the 
large new room in the left wing can 
be filled up for an ideal living and 
reading room. The decorations and 
arrangements are to be in charge of 
a committee of girls representing 
every class of each department, who 
will meet with Miss Bennet.
The room, our room, is to be a 
place to read, write, gossip or study 
in. It will be a girls room and fur
nished as only a girl can. There will 
be pictures of her favorite artist, mu
sician, actor or actress and perhaps 
architect, pennants and sketches on 
the walls; new shades and pretty 
stenciled curtains (if the girls will 
make them) for the windows; roomy 
lounging chairs, luxurious with cush
ions and tables lighted by soft read
ing lamps and loaded with favorite 
reading matter. Victrolas and grand 
pianos or what not, may be added as 
months go by, but we girls will have 
to live up to the stenciled curtains 
first. And of course we will.
A crepe is not to be hung on the 
old living room door, signifying dead 
or deserted. Oh, no! neither memory 
nor policy will allow.
Our late sanctuary will be trans
formed into a regular kitchen and 
dining room. The kitchen will have 
a new white sink and pots and pans; 
the dining room a number of new 
lockers to serve as individual pantries, 
in which to store away goodies or 
steel knives and forks. Imagine bein!> 
able to for get the dinggeries of an 
odorous kitchen by escaping to 
charming chattering living room.
Mr. Bossange is very anxious that 
the girls establish new traditions. 
Customs that will be carried out year 
after year. Because the school is 
so young, social life among the girls 
has been sadly neglected and limited. 
But our new room is going to help 
every one get better acquainted.
After the committee have had their 
heads together and all the girls have 
been interested and our new home 
takes on a cozy, comfortable, livable 
appearance, we are going to have 
a house warming; all girls, first girls. 
Then T. A. C. smokers wont have 
anything on us when it comes to good 
times. This year is going to be a 
memorable one for Design girls with 
our motto; Found new traditions; 
enjoy them and live up to them.

COMINGFEBRUARY 29th.
At last the veil of secrecy has been 
somewhat drawn and those who have 
been mystified and set to guessing 
the meaning and expounding the pos
sibilities of the sign in the Design 
School corridor reading, Coming 
?February 29th may have their 
curiosity bump somewhat lowered 
and their anxious suspense somewhat 
alleviated, for Sherlocko has been 
on the job.
Investigation leads to the following 
report:
It seems that, not content with 
their most successful affair given a 
short while ago in the form of a Leap 
Year Dance, the young ladies of the 
Tech Design Club are planning an
other and more elaborate Leap Year 
Dance for February 29th.
From the veiled threats and mono
syllabic hints dropped by the sphynxlike committee, we are led to predict 
and expect a night of festivity at least 
rivalling anything held, heretofore, in 
the Design School corridors. In short, 
there is an emphatic suggestion which 
leads to the expectation of real music, 
real entertainment, and, last but by no 
means, least, real eats.
Miss Frances Keppler is chairlady 
of the committee.
SCHOOL MEETING.
In place of the regular weekly lec
ture at 11:30 oclock Friday, a school 
assembly will be held in the theater 
at which time new officers will be

lege to attend.

The Brisk SmokeBull Durham
When you see an alert-looking young man in a 
lively argument roll a Bull Durham cigaretteits 
the natural thing. He likes to punctuate a crisp 
sentence with a puff of Bull Durham. His mind 
responds to the freshness thats in the taste of it, and 
his senses are quickened by its unique aroma. A 
cigarette of Bull Durham just fits in with keen 
thinking and forceful action.

Additional Design School News
HERE AND THERE.
Several Class A men are rushing 
designs for new types of submarines 
and air-craft to Washington for pat
ents. The country is safe!
Oh, boy! How the ears of Bill 
Weiglers friend, Mr. Clay, must have 
burned last Friday night! ! !
McCaughey had the misfortune to 
have one of his sailors washed over
board while carrying the last wash 
and had no time to rescue the poor 
fellow before the drawings were called 
in. Another martyr sacrificed.
There were more niggers on 
drawings this last charette than Class 
A men, which is usual. The spirit 
of co-operation is in a healthy and 
lively state in the Design School.
CLASS A CHARETTE.
The third class A charette came 
to an end last Saturday midnight. The 
subject of the projet, A Submarine 
Navy Yard, offered a variety of solu
tions, all quite interesting and intri
cate.
The drawings were carefully drawn 
and rendered and, as Mr. Hornbostel 
remarked, Did not look like charette 
drawings at all.
The critics expect not a few honors 
to fall Techs way at the judgment to 
be held in New York.
RESULTS OF CLASS B AND C 
JUDGMENT.
The results of the recent judgment 
of problems in New York on February 
1st as announced by Critic Ellington, 
our representative, were:
Class CFirst mentions, Oliver 
Wilkins and M. G. Barber. There 
were none refused and none declared
H. C.; that is, ruled out for nonobservance of the program or sketch.
Class BFirst mention, Long. 
Most of the others captured mentions.
NEW SOPHOMORE OFFICERS.
Nearly every member of the Soph

DRAMA STUDENTS STAGE PLAY
Continued from Page 1 
and Industries and the ladies of the 
order of Margaret Morrison have un
loosened the strings that close tight 
the openings of their pocket books 
and have swollen the sum to a neat 
little figure. The students in the De
sign School are waiting to spring a 
coup by which time they allege they
will equal the figures of the other 
three schools combined. In the mean
time the young bank which repose? 
on the bulletin board of the spacious 
corridor of the Design building grows 
restive with the irritating jumble and 
jar of descending lucre into its dark
ened and sealed coffer. The giving 
thus far shows that the students 
heart, indeed, is in the work and it 
was this evidence of student co-op
eration and response that encouraged 
the Relief Committee to go ahead 
with the idea of a monster benefit 
entertainment which from A to Z is 
to be a student business.
Apropos of the occasion, the name 
and theme of the play which the De
sign thespians will present, concerns 
warthe more adventuresome and ro
mantic side of war, that phase of this 
War which the public prints do not 
picture. The name of the play is The 
Master Spy and deals with the non
chalant wanderings of a French spy, 
Henri Durot. The piece was written 
in collaboration by Kenneth Sawyer 
Goodman and Ben Hecht. It opens 
with a prologue which is followed 
by three practically separate and in
dependent one act melodramas, The 
Two Lamps, The Hand of Shiva 
and The Death Watch. In each 
of these, Henri Durot plays the part 
of a spy and the reader will, for the 
present, take it on faith that his ex
periences are highly sensational and 
exciting. In a later issue of the Tar
tan, more will be unveiled concern
ing Monsieur Durot and his antennae 
of officers, non-coms, hindu mahibs, 
French peasants, and German bands. 
The production of The Master Spy 
will be under the joint direction of 
Mr. B. Iden Payne, Mrs. Thomas 
Wood Stevens, Mr. Frederick K. 
Cowley, Charles H. Meredith, and 
Frederic McConnell. During the en
tire acts special numbers by the Musi
cal Clubs, the Orchestra and the 
Choral Club are to be provided.
The object of the benefit perform
ance is to raise money for the war 
sufferers, yet the students are to be 
asked to remember that they are go
ing to be entertained in the best pos
sible manner that Tech ingenuity and 
ability can produce. It is hoped that 
the audience will be mostly of Tech 
students, at any rate the responsibil
ity of filling the Schenley Theatre is 
to be borne by the students and it is 
reasonable to expect that they will 
first solicit themselves. It is within 
the power of the Tech man and wom
an to make this affair a great triumph 
for a Tech civic spirit, a spirit if which 
properly developed will resemble 
nothing that has yet been felt on the 
campus. The aim of the comnrttee 
is to make the occasion of the 24th a 
great family party of students and 
faculty similar in a measure to that 
memorable gathering of students, fac
ulty and employes of the Carnegie 
Institute in Carnegie Hall last Spring 
when a personal and human compli
ment was paid to Mr. and Mrs. Car
negie who in turn graciously replied 
in kind. Only this gathering will be 
greater and better because it will 
have been made possible only by 
some little sacrifice on the part of 
every one there both in front and back 
of the foot lights.
The University of Redlands (Cali
fornia) recently held their regular apnual night shirt parade. Practically 
all the men students attired in night 
shirts and pajamas of various hues 
were out and in action. The entire 
crowd serpentined down town through 
the barber shops and stores and pic
ture shows. In several of the places 
the proprietors presented the boys 
with souvenirs.
