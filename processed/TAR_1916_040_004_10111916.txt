FINLAY MAKES 76-YARD RUN
The Tecli followers who were look
ing forward to a very hard game 
Saturday with Bethany were in no 
way disappointed. Judging from all 
angles it was a difficult game. The 
day was very warm and the ground 
was baked hard although water was 
kept playing on it all the forenoon.
To cap the climax, the West Vir
ginia eleven led by Coach. Heyman 
was a very tough proposition in it
self.
The stands were completely filled 
when the Bethany team came on 
the field followed by the plaid squad. 
Both sides were about equal in 
weight and looking at the two run
ning through signal practice one 
would expect about an equality in 
speeiL The Carnegie sympathizers 
muttered sighs of relief when they 
saw Salt Altdorfer in the line up. 
And well they could, for more than 
once he went through the line for 
eight or ten yards leaving a big hole 
in the line and tWo or three men 
strung in his wake.
Finlay as left half was another 
consistent winner. In the third quar
ter he received Riders kick-off on 
Tech's twenty yard line and carried 
it seventy-eight yards through sev
eral husky warriors to Bethanys four 
yard line where Rider stopped him. 
Rupp gained two yards through the 
line and Finley carried the ball over.
Kesner with his usual headiness 
^ y played a very good game. His end

nearly every time, but the left side 
of the line seemed to be camping on 
his trail and refused to let the plaid 
quarter back gain ground.

Expected to be Very Heavy 
and Fast Straight Football 
Will Be Used
Saturday, October 14, Tech meets 
the heavy Grove City College team. 
Little is known of the Grove City 
team this year, but is reported that 
ttfey are coming down loaded for 
bear. The one team they aim to 
beat most of all is Carnegie Tech. 
But of coi.rse this is just the oppo
site of wbac Tech wants and there is 
bound to be a stiff battle.
Football practice at Grove City 
College has been going on during 
the last three weeks under the 
skilled direction of Coaches Archer 
and White. Although much of the 
material is untried and inexperi
enced, there are strong possibilities 
that before the season is far ad
vanced a creditable team will be 
rounded into shape.
At present preparations are being 
made for the game with Carnegie 
Tech on October 14. This is always 
one^of the hardest games on the lo
cal schedule and the squad and 
coaches are anxious to make a good 
showing against the wearers of the 
plaid. The coaches expect to de
pend on straight football varied by 
an occasional forward pass. They 
are handicapped by the loss of a 
number of the most promising men 
of last yeafs squad. Several of. 
these are on the Mexican border. 
Therp is a possibility of their re
turning to school before the Carnegie 
Tech game.
It will be remembered from last

Meeting Calls Forth Much 
DiscussionLetter From 
Dean Bossange Read
The students of the School of Ap
plied Design on Friday morning held 
the most interesting meeting in the 
history of the school.
Several matters ot importance were 
discussed and argued pro and con 
in quite an able and parliamentary 
manner. A letter received by Acting 
Chairman Heilman from Dean Bos
sange was read and evoked much in
terest. The letter recommended a 
change In the regulations regarding 
Plebes and suggested a more lenient 
form of punishment for violation of 
senior-regulations. A motion intro
duced on the floor and designed to 
allow Plebes the privilege of fuss
ing the laddies without restriction, 
brought forth Websterian oratory 
from pros and antis, while their re
spective factions applauded their 
speakers vigorously. After much de
bate the motion was defeated by a 
close vote. A compromise motion to 
appoint a committee to further con
sider the question wa,s carried.
A letter was read from H. B. 
Pearce, last years President, on the 
subject of the forthcoming costume 
ball to be held by the students of 
Applied Design.
The elections created much interest^ due to the fact that the nomi
nees were men of ability and large 
association. A large vote was cast; 
some of .those elected obtaining,their

appointing a tutor for students who 
(Continued on Page Three.)
A considerable change in the gen
eral policy of the conducting of ath
letics at Carnegie Tech has been an
nounced, the most important change 
being the supplementing of parttime athletic coaches by men who 
will be at Tech during the whole 
year rather than just a few hours 
per week.
The change came about as a re
sult of a meeting of a committee 
appointed by the Director last 
spring to consider the Departments 
of Physical Education and Athletics. 
This committee submitted the fol
lowing plans and recommendations: 
May 1st," 1016. 
Director Hamerschlag:
Your committee appointed to con
sider and recommend a plan for the 
organization of the Departments of 
Physical Education and Athletics re
spectfully submits the Hollowing re
port:
It is considered advisable to pre-1 
sent to you two plans oL organiza
tion; one based upon ihe assumption 
of ample funds, the other upon a 
slight increase over the present bud
get.
1. Assuming ample funds available, we recommend as the best plan 
of organization:
a. That the Departments of Phys
ical Education and Athletics be or
ganized separately.
b. That each department head be 
placed in full charge of and be re
sponsible for the policy of his de
partment and the results secured.
c. That the head of the Depart
ment of Athletics coach at least one 
of the varsity sports.
d. That other coach or couches, 
as may be necessary, be secured for 
the entire year, helping out In other 
branches as the head of. athletics 
may direct.
2. Assuming as operating cost a 
slight increase over the presont bud
get, we recommend as the best; plan:
a. That the Departments of Phys
ical Education and Athletics bo com
bined under one head.
b. That the head of the depart
ment bo given full charge of and be 
responsible for the policy of both 
branches and the results .obtained.
c. That the head of the depart
ment coach one of the varsity sports, 
preferably baskotball, track or base(Con tin lied on Page Three.)

outlined plans for the year. i
It is Mr. Van Dyks wish to orj 
ganize a national wireless league ; 
among all technical schools and uni| 
versities having wireless sets, and, i 
use the Radio Club for the nucleus j 
of this new organization.
The function of. such an organiza

but to relay the scores of contests 
whenever possible. Among the col
leges which, will join this league are 
University of Michigan, Ohio State, 
University of Denver and others 
which will constitute a ,relay chain 
from coast to coast, and from boundry to boundry.

CORNELL TRIP FREE.
The Tartan has decided to present 
a railroad ticket to Ithaca and 
turn, to some registered student of 
Tech, free of charge. The ticket will 
be presented to the winner, of a com
petition which is explained in this 
editorial.
Carnegie Tech is a young school. 
It has few established, ^ustoms, tra
ditions, rulos or precedents; Every 
day changes are being made in its 
student activities and its athletics; 
the graduate malingers duties are 
constantly changing; methods of 
holding class elections have only re
cently boen improved. All theso 
things show that progress is being 
made. And the many continual 
changes lead to tho logical conclu
sion that others will follow. We bolloVe> that many Improvements are 
still possiblo, and furthermore wo 
hollove idoas for such improvements 
are numorous among the students of 
tho school, but that no real oppor
tunity presents itself In tho usual 
run of school life to glvo expression 
to those Idoas. Aiu| tills brings us 
to tho purpose of the competition. 
'What, The Tartan wants Is ideas, or 
constructive criticisms, which havo 
us their object tho Improvement of 
Tech. Wo often hoar students say 
that this and that should bo changod, 
that it should be managed in a, dif
ferent manner. Often these Ideas 
are good ones. In order to stimulate 
a greater interest in school affairs, 
and to give every student an oppor
tunity to express some idea he may 
have. The Tartan offers to present a 
.round trip railroad ticket, including 
expense of berth, to the student of 
the day or night school who sends 
us the best idea. The merits of the 
idea will be judged by Graduate Man*ager Gearhart, Dr. Esquerre, Mr. Ii.

A testing machine of the universal 
type has recently been purchased from 
Tinius Olsen & Co., Philadelphia, Pa., 
for the Materials Laboratory. The 
loads are applied by screw power and 
are weighed by a lever system. The 
capacity of the machine of 400,000 
pounds, which is sufficient to test in 
tension a bar of structural stepl 2% 
inches in diameter. The pulling 
screws are of sufficient length to 
crush a column having a length of 10 
feet, and special 'extension arms make 
possible the testing in cross-binding of 
beams having a span of 20 feet.
Because of convenience in handling 
specimens the weighing table will be 
placed at the floor level, which has 
made necessary an excavation 6 feet 
deep for the .body of the machine, with 
a pit 10 feet deep under the pulling 
screws. After the machine is installed 
about December 1, by a representative 
of Olsen <& Co., its accuracy will be 
determined by calibration with a stand
ard bar and extensometer obtained 
from tho United States Bureau of 
Standards.
Owing to its capacity and unusual 
adaptation for compression and Cross-! 
bending tosts this machine will add 
groatly to tho present facilities for 
student instruction and will also prove 
invaluable for research work.

High Moral Standard Means Something 
More Than a Negative Sort of Virtue
By DR. ARTHUR T. HADLEY, President of Yale University.
We must ourselves be prepared to set an example of restraint 
ami devotion. We must not be content with the negative sort of 
virtue that simply avoids offenses against the moral code o:ii the 
community. We should not regard ourselves at temperate when 
we simply abstain from excess in drink. We must face the harder 
task of avoiding excesses in word and thought and feeling. We 
should not regard ourselves as moral when we simply abstain from 
violation of the marriage contract, or of commercial law, or of the 
rules for keeping peace between men and nations.
We must learn to think of marriage not as a' relation entered 
into by two people for their own pleasure but as a partnership in 
the serious work of life, to be entered into with the same in toll iDR. W. D. SCOTT HEADS

western University,' one of. the fore-j 1! 
most practical psychologists in the | *:) 
country, is on a temporary leave from I 
the Illinois school and is in charge of 
the salesmanship bureau at Tech! He 
has under him a staff of several as
sistants, all of them experts in this 
particular line of educational activity.
The principal work of the bureau 
is to assist large corporations in per
fecting sales methods and systems of 
selecting salesmen. Its work is high
ly technical and consists of making 
mental tests with special psycholog
ical apparatus of various groups of 
men to determine what qualities of 
character and temperament go to 
make up the successful and the less 
successful salesmen. The bureaus 
list of contributing corporations not 
only include great Pittsburgh indus
tries but some of the largest sales or
ganizations in the country, and both 
Dr. Scott and Dr. Bingham have fre
quently occasion to make trips to 
various cities to assist in carrying on 
tho work of. the bureau.
For-the benefit of night students of 
Tech, Dr. Scott is giving this semes

Dockstaderwill start out the 
season, but there is still room for 
much new material. The loss of 
Captain Walker will be seriously 
felt.
In the past the Tech track team 
has been noted for the ability of 
its distance runners, which can be 
traced directly from the training 
received in cross country work. 
For this reason, all. men who in
tend to run the 880-yard, mile or 
two-mile, are advised to come out 
for cross, country.
The schedule for this year calls 
for three, and possibly four, meets. 
One of these is the trip to Wor
cester University, where that team 
is planning to secure revenge for 
the defeat handed them by the 
Tech team 011 the home course last 
year. Another meet is the annual 
P. A. A. Cross Country meet in 
which arc entered such strong 
teams as P. A. A., U of P., West
minster, Bethany-and local ath
letic clubs. Last year Tech fin
ished second in this meet, only P. 
A. A. defeating them in the final 
score.
A great deal is expected of Lawsen this year. Although last year 
was only his first year in competi
tion, lie showed good ability and 
should develop wonderfully the 
coming years. DeYoung and 
Howe are both earnest workers 
and should prove mainstays on 
the team this season. J

Plans are rapidly rounding into 
shape among the Design School stu
dents for their forthcoming Costume 
Fete.
During the past three years tne 
students of. the Design School have 
presented these occasions with a 
spirit and gorgeousness unrivalled 
by any art school in the country and 
rivalling the famous Quartz Arts 
Balls in the Ecole-des-Beaux Arts in 
Paris.
The style adopted this year is the 
Impressionstfc Style o Art, especial
ly as found among the peasantry of 
Eastern Europe, and as expressed, 
more or less, by Bahkst, the great 
Russian artist.
The date of the fete will probably 
be set two or three weeks before 
the Christmas holidays in order to 
allow plenty of time for the study of 
styles of costumes and decorations.
Further and more exact plans will 
be announced by the committee as 
they are worked out.

FIRST FOOTDALL 
PROGAM APPEARS
The first football program of the 
season, which appeared last Satur
day, is a marked improvement over 
previous programs both in makeup 
and subject matter, the historical 
sketch of football at Tech being par
ticularly noteworthy. Statistics con
cerning the team are interesting, and 
the cuts are very good. In fact, the 
quality ofthe program this year is 
of such a nature that a game can 
be followed very intelligently with 
its assistance.

AT THE STRAND
The attraction at the Strand, the 
Rowland & Clark theater at Forbes 
and Atwood, Wednesday, is Edith 
Storey and Antonio Moreno in the 
Shop Girl in connection with a 
cartoon comedy. A faithful picturization of Friday, the 13th, Thomas 
W. Lawsons famous novel of the 
stock market, is shown Thursday 
with Robert Warwick in the leading 
role. The Love Comet, a Keystone 
comedy, is also shown. Th Dream 
Girl, in which May Murray is star
red Friday, is a mixture of fantasy 
and real life that is most entertain
ing. Harry Myers and Rosemary 
Theby in A Grain of Suspicion, a 
Vim comedy and a Metro travelogue 
is also - shown. Charlie Chaplin jn 
The Heart Thief, is shown at the 
Oakland, Friday.
Hazel Dawn and Owen Moore are 
seen Monday in Under Cover, a 
clever farce comedy in which the 
events transpire fast and furious. 
The mixture of smuggled jewels, cus
tom officers at New York, clever 
crooks and a well defined case of 
love at first sight combine into a pic
ture that is more than usually inter
esting. Tuesday, Mister 44, with 
Harold Lockwood and May Allison, 
clever Metro stars, is on the bill. It 
is also a comedy dream revolving 
around the note which the operative 
in a shirt factory puts in one of the 
shirts she makes, and the results 
when an eastern mining engineer 
writes back that she should look him 
up when in need.~She happens to be in 
need at that moment, and the result 
is that she travels to the West to meet 
Mister 44. It is a thoroughly en
tertaining photoplay.
COACHING SYSTEM CHANGED
(Continued from Pago One.) 
ball, and engage coaches for the 
other sports, one of whom shall bo 
secured for the entire year.
d. Under this plan the offlco of 
graduate manager be continued.
In summing up our deliberations 
the point which strikos out prom
inently as resulting from them, suc
cess of either plan depends not so 
much on a plan as upon the selec
tion of the right man to carry it 
through.
Should either of these plans of. or
ganization meet your approval, and 
an amount bo statod for operating 
the departments or department, the 
committee will bo pleased to consid
er further the detail of the organ
ization and report.
Respectfully submitted,
E. ESQUERRE,
H. J. McCORKLi:
W. P. STEFFENS 
J. R. GEARHART,
* J. H. McCULLOCII.
The main part of tho second plan 
has, been accepted. Undor this plan 
Mr. J. 1-1. McGulloch will bo head of 
both the deparlments of Physical 
Education and Athletics. Both de
partments will be entirely under his 
supervision. Mr. Eyeman, who has 
had considerable experience in track 
work with the Y. M. C. A. at Foivt 
Collins, Colo., will have charge of 
the track team. The benefits of hav
ing a coach, in such a branch of ath
letics as track work, who will be 
about the school all of the time in
stead of,only a few hours a week, 
are obvious. Mr. Eyeman, who has 
always been able to put his person
ality into his work, will prob
ably be able to produce a successful 
track team. The change which has 
been made in the coaching of the 
teams was not done with the inten
tion of changing the individuals who 
have had charge of. coaching, but 
rather to change the coaching sys
tem. And to do away with part time 
coaches who, while they may be very 
proficient in their work, are not able 
to bring the personal touch, which 
is so essential, into the building up 
of a team.
As a result of this personal touch 
it is thought that more men will 
come out to participate in the vari
ous branches of athletics.
The baseball team will be under 
the supervision of Mr. McCulloch, 
who, it will be remembered, coached 
the nnjst successful team Tech ever 
had, some three or four-years ago.
A coach for basketball Is at pres
ent being secured.
A new assistant, Mr. E. C. Offlnger, has been socurod to aid in 
the work of tho department of Phys
ical Education. Mr. Oillnger Is a 
(graduate of the Battle Creek Normal 
School; he also spent two years at 
Willlston, East Hampton, Mass. For 
the past three years he has been 
teaching in a high school in Wis
consin.
In order to clarify the financial
situation of the Athletic Association, 
a report of the income and expendi
tures of this organization is printed 
herewith.
It .will bo noted that the expendi
tures of the association have, during 
the past two years, exceeded the in
come. This is due to the fact that 
a balance had accumulated, which is 
being used up.
Tho figures under the column 
marked Equipment represent, the 
expenses o equipment, guarantee, 
officials, trips, etc., above the receipts 
taken in at tho games. The sal
aries of tho coaches and graduate 
manager shown are not tho total sal
aries, but the part of tho salaries 
borne by tho athletic association. 
In the case of the proposed budget 
for tho coming year, the salaries of 
tho coaches of basketball, baseball 
and track are included in the salaries 
of the men in the employ of the 
school.

fraternity of national reputation, 
which has chapters in all the tech
nical schools of the country. The 
local chapter is ono of. tho strongest 
in the organization. It is very es
sential that each member be a well 
rounded and broad-minded man, and 
for these reasons a man is chosen, 
not only because of his high schol
astic standing, but also because of 
his having taken part, at some time, 
in me or more of the school ac
tivities.
Those eligible for membership are 
the highest in the Sophomore class, 
also tho highest 12 percent of Junior 
classmen and the highest 25 percent 
of Senior classmen. The Tau Beta 
Pi Is a body of such standing in 
Toch that It is  surpassed by no 
others, and membership in the same 
is surely a thing that new Tech men 
should strive for.

History of Beta Theta Epsilon.
The Beta Theta Epsilon Fraternity 
was founded October 15, 1907, by six 
students of the Schools of Applied 
Science and Applied Design, after 
methods of organization had been 
discussed with certain members of 
the Faculty, who were National Fra
ternity men. During the first year 
of the fraternitys existence meetings 
were held at the homes of various 
members, several of whom were resi
dents of Pittsburgh. Early in the 
year 1908 rooms were secured on 
Dithridge street.
Early in the spring of 1909 the 
constitution and by-laws were re
vised and new quarters obtained in 
the Lloyd building. At this time a 
decided improvement was noted in 
the fraternity, both in its strength 
and in the personnel of its members.
In 1910 better quarters were, se
cured at 401 Dithridge street, and 
further . development in the internal 
organization was made. The mem
bership had now increased to over 
twenty men, and the influence of the 
chapter was greatly broadened.
The increasing need of a new 
home resulted in the leasing of a 
house in May, 1911. A committee 
was appointed to purchase furniture, 
for which funds amounting to about 
$1800 were loaned by the members.
Since March, 1914, the active chap
ter has issued a monthly publica
tion entitled the Beta Theta, the 
object of which was tokeep the 
alumni in closer touch with the fra
ternity and the institution. January 
1, 1914, the Alumni Association of 
Beta Theta Epsilon was formed.
History of Sigma Nu.
The Sigma Nu fraternity was 
founded at the Virginia Military In
stitute on January 1, 1869. The 
growth of the fraternity gradually 
spread through the South and West, 
coming north across the Mason and 
Dixon line, and placing chapters in 
such schools as Lehigh, Lafayette, 
Columbia, Cornell, Syracuse, Dart
mouth, Maine, Brown and Penn 
State.
The membership of the fraternity 
is now approximately 13,000, and 
maintains 74 chapters, of which 33 
own their own houses, representing 
an investment of $500,000. Fortyeight alumni chapters have been es
tablished throughout the country, one 
of .the most active of which is lo
cated in Pittsburgh.
The Sigma Nu fraternity is divid
ed into seventeen geographical divi
sions. The new chapter at Carnegie 
Tech will become a member of the 
fifth division, including the'states of 
Ohio, West Virginia and Western 
Pennsylvania. The colleges in this 
division are Bethany, Ohio State, Mt. 
Union, West Virginia, Case and 
Western Reserve.
The Installation.
The installation conducted under 
the auspices of the Pittsburgh Alum
ni Association was commenced with 
the pledging, ceremony in the Wil
liam Penn hotel. An installation 
committee, with R. L. Bovard of 
Penn State as chairman, conducted 
the affair, representatives from the 
following schools being in attend
ance :
Bethany College, Beatty, W. Va.; 
Ohio State University, Columbus, O.; 
Mt. Union College, Alliance, O.; 
West. Virginia University, Morgan
town, W. Va.; Case School of Ap
plied Science, and the Western Resorve University, Cleveland, O. The 
following alumni chapters sent dele
gates: Akron, O.; Cincinnati, O.;
Cleveland, O., and Columbus, O.
On Saturday morning the repre
sentatives from the chapters in the 
fifth division and several other visit
ors attending, the installation were 
conducted through the schools. Mr. 
I-Iartman and Mr. Taylor of the In
dustries school explained the various 
departments and their work to the 
visitors. Some of the alumni of the 
Design school escorted the party 
through Design building, and one of 
the students of M.' M. C. S. explained 
the departments of the girls school 
as the p,arty inspected the building.
The impressive initiation ceremony 
held Saturday afternoon marked the 
last day of Beta Theta Epsilon and 
the birth of Sigma Nu at Tech.
At the banquet held in the even
ing the following toasts were given: 
Walter E. Myers, grand counsellor, 
toastmaster; Welcome, L. L. Hop
kins, inspector, Fifth div.; A Mes
sage from the East, A. H. Wilson, 
past regent; Preparedness, Bixby 
Willis, general secretary; Tech and 
Its Future, A. A. Hamerschlag, di
rector of C. I. T.; Vim, Ferd H. 
Heywood, past. grand treasurer; 
Delta Sigma, Lamont C. Button, 
Delta sigma.
The feature of the banquet was 
easily the speech delivered by the 
Director. Walter E. Meyers, grand 
counsellor of Sigma Nu, in comment
ing upon the Directors s^ ,ech, said: 
I wish every fraternity man in the 
Country could have hoard it. The 
Director explained the policy, origin 
and general plan of the institution 
and brought out tho facts concern
ing the plan of each of the four 
schools. He related the struggles 
that had been gone through to make 
a school, of such a unique character 
as Tech, properly understood 
throughout the country. In speaking 
of the fraternity at large he urged 
that fraternal love be extended be
yond the members of the fraternity 
itself., and that fraternal brotherhood 
be extended to mankind in general.
