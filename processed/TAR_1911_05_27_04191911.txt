PITTSBURGH, PA., WEDNESDAY, APRIL 19, 1911.
MASS MEETING
To be held Thursday Evening, April 27, at 8 oclock;
CARNEGIE MUSIC HALL
Entire Student Body to Turn Out.
On Thursday evening, April 27th, at 8.00 oclock, 
a reception is to be held for Mr. and Mrs. Carnegie 
in the Carnegie Music Hall. The entire student body 
together with the faculty and alumni are to turn out 
and greet the Pounder and his wife. The program, 
which it was hoped to have ready to run in this issue 
of the Tartan, will be printed in full, together with 
the official program for Pounders Day, in the issue 
of the Tartan for next week. This issue will come 
out on Tuesday afternoon instead of Wednesday in 
order that it may be placed in the hands of the stud
ents before Thursday.
At the reception of the students that will be held 
on Thursday evening the plan is to make everything 
as simple as possible so as not to tax Mr. Carnegies 
strength unnecessarily. Director Hamerschlag will 
make an address of welcome and it is hoped that Mr. 
Carnegie will give us a short address. The students 
are to sing one or two of Techs songs for Mr. and 
Mrs. Carnegie. The Alumni Association through its 
president may make some presentation but that feat
ure has not yet been definitely decided upon. The 
reception will then be declared over, making a short 
and simple ordeal for Mr. Carnegie to go through.
As announced in last weeks issue of the Tartan, 
tickets will be required for entrance. These tickets 
can be obtained now by applying in person or by 
letter at the Registrars office, Room 115 of the In
dustries Building. All students desiring tickets
should apply for them at once for upon the number of 
students applying depends the whether or not tickets 
will be given to parents and friends of students who 
might desire them. Certain parts of the hall will 
be set aside for certain groups of the student body 
as follows:
Faculty.........................................................On the platform

4THE TARTAN
We have noticed on similiar occasions that the 
speakers often had considerable difficulty in getting 
out of the building owing to the fact that the same 
exit is used as the audience. Let it be an understood 
thing, therefore, that the students will remain in 
their places until sufficient time shall have elapsed 
for Mr. and Mrs. Carnegie to have left the hall. It 
will make it much pleasanter for both Mr. and Mrs. 
Carnegie and is not, we think, asking too much of 
the students.
We said last week that we regarded it the duty of 
every student to be present at this meeting. It is the 
only chance we have ever had to really show to Mr. 
Carnegie the esteem we have for him and to thank 
him personally for making our institution possible. 
The man who fails to take advantage of this oppor
tunity should not receive the benefits accruing from 
an education within these walls. He is not, if he 
fails to attend, a Tech man. See to it that you are 
there. Make this reception the biggest event in our 
history.
MECHANICALS ORGANIZE BOOSTERS UNION.
In keeping with the progressive, constructive and 
boosting spirit that has always prevailed among these 
gentlemen, the Junior Mechanicals have gotten to
gether and organized a Boosters Union.
The object of this union is to boost, in a concerted 
manner, things in general by recruiting its ranks 
from the individual boosting and non-boosting ele
ment in the schools.
The Junior Mechanicals do not want to be the 
only can on the dump by being the only organized 
body of boosters in the school, hence have decided 
to let everybody in who wishes to become a member 
of the union.
The election of officers of the organization, held 
recently, the following gentlemen were chosen:
Alfred J. Ormstonr President.
James K. Lamoree, Secretary and Treasurer.
Mike Phillips, Frank L. Dales, walking delegates.
Those wishing to join are requested to see Mr. 
Lamoree.
Mr. Ormston says he will make things hum from 
now on.
Mr. Ormston is from-------------Aw! forget it!
(The Tartan wishes to state that it has joined 
the union.)
TECH STUDENTS FIGURE IN STRENUOUS 
TOURNG CAR TRIP.
Luther M. Patterson, J., and K. G. Walker of the 
Junior Mechanical Class along with two friends made 
a trip from Pittsburgh to Lock Haven, early last week 
in L. M, Pattersons, Sr., 30 H. P. Packard car.
The distance which is about 200 miles was covered 
in 22 hours and 40 minutes, which time is remark
ably good considering the fact that most of the run 
was made through mud up to the hubs and through 
heavy mountain snows. Between Ebensburg and 
Loretto the mud was so deep that the car sank down
and rested on the running boards, making it neces
sary to tear down a fence to make a road before the 
car would move. The mud clogged the radiator so 
that the water boiled and made it necessary to pack 
snow into the radiator every half mile or so; there 
being no water at hand. Chains were not sufficient 
to give the car traction, so over 100 feet of 3-4 inch 
rope was used on the wheels.
This was the first car to cross the Allegheny moun
tains this year, the heavy snow drifts on the moun
tains precluding such form of travel.
Two tires were changed and the engine was not 
touched during the entire trip, dispite the wear and 
tear on the machine.
MECHANICAL CHARETTE.
Emulating the architects by singing that edifying 
melody, We are, we are we are the noble archi
tects, the Junior Mechanicals worked all night last 
Monday, a week ago, to complete a problem in de
sign assigned to them by the American Society of 
Mechanical Architects.
As a further emulation of the noble architects, that 
tear producing refrain Jungletown was occasionally 
sandwiched in for a change.
Everything was done to give the all night event a 
real architectural charette like flavor; the object 
being to give each one a taste of what it is to be 
an architect on a charette week.
The only jarring note to the proceedings was an 
occasional solo by Mr. Frank L. Dalas. Mr. Dalas 
says he used to be able to sing.
Be that as it may, however, do what they could to 
emulate the architects they were unable to prevent 
the disinterested spectator from forming the con
clusion that an architect and an engine wiper were 
two different things.
HUMOR ON THE INSTALLMENT PLAN.
At the foot of page 7 in the last issue of the Tar
tan, the following remnant of humor appears:
The host cast him an angry glance.
Dang it! Im saying grace he yelled.Titbits.
The Tartan would like herewith to apologize for 
giving only the tail end of the above joke, which ap
pears' to be a very good one. It regrets that it is 
unable to locate the other part of it as it appears to 
have strayed somewhere.
It would like to vindicate itself, however, by stat
ing that the above is a mistake and not an instal
ment of humor.
The Tartan likes to be liberal in everything and 
when it comes across anything that is the very em
bodiment of unadulterated humor it believes in giv
ing the whole thing away, and it hopes that the 
above mistake will not be charged as being intention
ally made.
The publication of pure and unabridged humor is 
one of the policies of the Tartan.

THE TARTAN5
TECH LOSES FIRST GAME.
After having been disappointed on Friday on ac
count of rain, the varsity base ball team left Satur
day morning for Morgantown, W. Va., where they 
played in the afternoon. It was the first game for 
Tech and was lost to the West Virginia team by the 
score of 7 to 1. The result was encouraging to the 
team for several reasons. The nine was crippled 
by the absense of a regular catcher and a substi
tute first baseman. Owing to some misunderstand
ing, both Atchison and Shenafelt were absent when 
the train left, and Saunders, who was relied upon 
to cover first base, also failed to report. Capt. Moor
head was used behind the bat, and, while not so 
sure as at first, caught a good game. Blanchard was 
brought in from the outfield to cover the initial sack, 
and DeMuth sent to his place.
The lack of out door practice, and especially prac
tice of the reduced squad, was shown by a want of 
confidence in each other at times. Neither team 
played a brilliant game, and the contest rested on 
the pitchers almost entirely.
In this department, Chick Moorhead, Brown 
and Urquhart showed themselves fully the equals 
of the University men, both in coolness and in gen
eral work. Moorehead, in the four and one-half 
innings which he occupied the mound, twice pitched 
himself out of trying situations. Urquhart relieved 
Moorhead and downed the first three men on in
field flies. Miner Brown received the ovation of 
the day from the bleacherites when he went to the 
box in the seventh inning, but he did not lose his 
nerve.
The game was started by Vail hitting over second, 
and advancing on a wild throw by Lively, the short 
stop. Blanchard knocked a fly back of first which 
was caught by McClure. Gearhart hit to second, and 
was safe on the throw to third which retired Vail. 
Bill Moorhead failed to connect and was called 
out.
McClure received a free pass to first, advancing 
one base on a hit by Riddle, McMinn was hit by Moor
head and the bases filled. Wyatt hit to the pitcher, 
who sent the ball to his brother in time to catch 
McClure at home and relay it to first for a double 
play. Riddle came home in the meantime for the 
first score. Hutchison struck out, ending the inning.
West Virginia scored one in the third, and three 
times in the fourth, and ended in the sixth with two 
more.
Techs run was made in the sixth inning. Capt 
Moorhead, first man up was hit by the pitcher. He 
reached second while Brine was striking out, and 
came home on a hit by Kirk over first base. Kirk 
was caught trying to steal second and Raisig, after 
being given a walk, was also retired between first 
and second. The game was called at the end of the 
first half of the eighth inning to allow Tech to catch 
a train.
As Pitt was beaten by the Mountaineers on the 
Saturday previous by a score of 8 to 0, our team
is confident of winning next Saturdays game. Ah 
Tech men must come out and support the team 
against the crowd of rooters expected from Pitt.

THE STUDENT COMMITTEE BUSY.
During the last vacation the student committee 
for high school recruits mailed letters to all the 
students who spent the Easter vacation in their 
home towns. These letters urged a little personal 
work for Tech in regard to securing future Plebes 
for their Alma Mater. No special time should be 
set aside for this workbut whenever possible do 
not fail to speak a good word for your school. Grad
uates and students of the foremost colleges of the 
country spend much of their time and money show
ing the desirable high school men the advantages of 
their institution. So go to it, Tech men. Many 
thanks are due to Dean Leete, Miss McGraw, Miss 
Donehoo and Miss Ostermaier for the interest and 
time they gave to the work. Ritchie Laurie, Jr.

THE TARTAN
A TRIP TO PANAMA.
An Account of Prof. Motts Visit.
The work of building the Panama Canal has now 
reached such a stage of advancement as to offer 
the visiting engineer an excellent opportunity to see 
all classes of work under construction, to study the 
many kinds of plant in operation on the Isthmus 
and even to form some conception of how this great 
undertaking will appear when it is completed. An 
appreciation of these points doubtless influenced Pre
sident Taft when he invited the members of the 
American Society of Civil Engineers to visit the 
Canal Zone and to inspect the variousi works as 
guests of the Isthmian Canal Commission.
On the second of March a party of about seventyfive civil engineers, many of them accompanied by 
their wives, sailed from New York on the United 
Fruit Companys steamer Zacapa, bound for Colon.
New York gave us a cold and snowy send-off, but 
in thirty-six nours we were enjoying warm breezes 
and clear skies, and for the remainder of the three 
weeks trip we were favored by continuous bright 
weather. Port Antonio was our first stop and most 
of the party took advantage of this opportunity to 
get a glimpse of Jamaica. '
We breakfasted ashore and spent the entire morn
ing wandering about this beautifully situated and 
orderly little town, or took one of the many inter
esting drives into the surrounding country. A four 
hour railway journey southward across the island 
brought us to Kingston, now a prosperous, busy city 
and showing few traces of the serious earthquake of 
1907. 'me work of reconstruction has been carried 
out in a characteristic substantial English fashion.
Our steamer having come around to Kingston durthe day we went aboard for dinner and sailed im
mediately.
It is less than two days to Colon and we ran be
fore the north east trades which gave us our first 
excuse for being sea sick and, as usual, several of 
the party took advantage of the opportunity. By 
noon of the 9th we were off Colon, just a week from 
New York. After a brief medical examination, our 
boat was docked and the baggage put ashore. Thanks 
to our semi-official character customs examinations 
were waived and we were soon on board a special 
train bound for Panama City. Our party was in
creased at Colon by about fifty more engineers and 
their wives who had come direct from New Orleans 
and landed a few hours ahead of us. The railroad 
equipment marked P. R. R. gave one a home-like 
feeling; the weather was that of a clear July after
noon, and as our train drew out through the yards 
where are kept immense stores of every kind of ma
chine and device used on the Zone, and with little 
trace or hint of the tropical vegetation to be seen, 
it was hard to realize that we were at last crossing 
the Isthmus of Panama, the very name of which 
brings up visions of peril and sudden death.
Our first glimpse of actual construction work on 
a larger scale was at Gatun where the great white 
lock walls were most impressive.
But we were not to make any inspections on this 
trip; we reached Panama City in about two hours 
and were soon comfortably located at the Hotel Ti
voli, the largest of the Government hotels on the 
Zone. Our time for the next week was carefully 
planned out for us and as few of the day light hours 
would be spent in Panama City, we took advantage 
of our late afternoons and evenings to inspect the 
city and spend our odd pennies on Panama hats 
made in Ecuador! Only a few of the more observant 
ones in the party noticed this first evening that the 
sun was out of place, and the first real jar to our 
knowledge of geography came next morning when 
we realized that the sun was rising out of the Pa
cific! Indeed it takes more than a weeks stay on the 
Isthmus to become reconciled to old Sols absurd 
behavior.
A detailed statement of all that we did and saw 
during that busy week would be impossible in the 
space allotted me.
Each morning our hosts, Col. Goethals and his 
associates on the Commission, together with various 
members of the engineering staff, welcomed us on 
our special,' and promptly at eight oclock we 
pulled out of Panama station bound for some im
portant part of the canal work.
First it was the Culebra cut where we spent a 
long morning, passing to and fro over the many con
struction tracks, beginning in the very bottom and 
ending far up on the hillside where we could see 
many miles of the construction work in each direc
tion.
Even Congressional delegations cannot interfere 
with the economical expenditure of government 
funds more than did we stopping work trains and 
shovels here, there and everywhere. Time is cer
tainly money on the Canal Zone where thirty or 
forty thousand men are working. Some of the ex
cavated material goes eastward to the Pacific and 
some westward to the Atlantic side, and the care
ful adjustment of train operation is vital to the pro
per working of all parts of the vast system.
The second day we saw the concrete lock under 
construction at Pedro Miguel, the Pacific end of the 
Culebra cut. Here vessels will descend from the 
85 foot or summit level of the canal to Miraflores 
lake at level 55. Two miles further eastward are 
the two Miraflores locks where boats are lowered 
to sea level. At Pedro Miguel the concrete work is 
nearing completion but at the latter place the work 
is little more than well begun.
Gatun, with its great earthern dam a mile and a 
half in length and the three locks in one flight, 
proved to be second only in interest to the great 
Cut. The dam is built partly of excavated material 
from the Culebra cut and partly of finer soil dredged 
from the swamps and Chagres river bed. It is more 
than half completed, but its great length and width 
give it the appearance of a low hill rather than that

---------------------------------------------------

THE TARTANI
of the conventional dam. At Gatun vessels from 
the Atlantic side, after traversing some seven or 
eight miles of sea level canal, will be raised by three 
locks, in a distance of three thousand feet, to the 
level of Gatun lake, at grade 85; and this lake will 
extend through the intervening country and the Culebra cut to Pedro Miguel, as mentioned above, a dis
tance along the axis of the canal of over thirty miles. 
The lake will have an area of more than one hundred 
and sixty square* miles. The locks themselves are 
gigantic. They are built of concrete and extend over 
a mile in length. More than two million cubic yards 
of concrete will be used in their construction.
The immense dump for waste material at Balboa, 
the Naos breakwater, the Ancon quarries and the 
reconstruction work on the Panama railway all pre
sent most interesting examples of engineering work 
conducted on a large scale.
The two cities of Panama and Colon, while very 
unlike in character, furnish striking examples of 
what good municipal housekeeping can accomplish.
Both are now furnished with an abundant supply 
of wholesome water, each has a sewerage system 
which discharges into sea water, and within a short 
time Colon will have an excellent storm water drain
age system and well surfaced streets. The general 
grade of Colon is being raised by pumping in sand 
and gravel, and as fast as this work is completed 
in any section the streets are macadamized; so that 
the entire town will be made over before the year is 
out. Panama, having more irregularities in grade 
than Colon, is readily drained, and the heroic me
thods adopted when the Americans took charge of 
the Canal Zone have resulted in making Panama a 
marvel of cleanliness, with every street, alley and 
court paved and kept in good condition. Much as 
we may wonder at the immense scale upon which 
most of the engineering operations are being con
ducted, nothing impresses the visitor more forcibly 
than the results accomplished by the sanitary forces 
under the direction of Col. Gorgas. Today the work 
of clearing and burning the underbrush, of draining 
and oiling the swamps and water courses, the sani
tary inspection and hospital service, all go on so 
quietly and smoothly that one is apt to overlook the 
pioneer work in these lines already accomplished,
and to forget that this work has been, is now and
probably always will' be a vital factor in the success 
of the entire project. To Colonel Gorgas and his 
corps must be assigned a place second to none, when 
the story of the canal building is completed.
On the last evening of our stay upon the Isthmus, 
Colonel Goethals came over to the hotel and ex
plained his plans and hopes for the future of the
work. He answered innumerable questions, as he 
had been doing for a whole week, and closed with a 
few remarks regarding the aid such a body of en
gineers as our party comprised might render upon 
our return to the states.
Engineers are not easily stampeded, yet I think I 
have never seen a body of men rise to their feet and 
cheer more spontaneously and genuinely than did
our party when Colonel Goethals finished his re
marks and, bowing, left the room.
Tall and commanding in appearance, his snow 
white hair the only outward evidence of the burden 
he bears, no one can meet the Chairman and Chief 
Engineer of the Isthmian Canal Commission without 
being charmed by the directness and simplicity of 
his manner and at the same time impressed by the 
power of his personality and his wonderful grasp of 
the problem before him.
Our week of inspection passed rapidly, the round of 
technical inspection visits broken only by a visit to 
Taboga Island, on Sunday, where we feasted on the 
finest pine apples in the world, and by an informal 
reception tendered the party by the President of the 
Republic of Panama.
On the return trip our party divided again, about 
one third returning to New Orleans and the others 
to New York.
Every member of the party returned an enthus
iastic believer in the ultimate success of the Panama 
Canal work, a thoro convert to the lock canal as com
pared to the sea level plan and, above all, convinced 
that the worA is in competent and honest hands.
W. E. Mott.
DESIGN DANCE DATE CHANGED.
Will now be held on May 1st.
The date for the Design Club Dance has been 
changed to May 1st. It will be held, as was origin
ally planned, on the floor of the Conservatory of 
Music. Posters are placed around on the various 
bulletins announcing the places at which tickets may 
be obtained.
GOOD SCHEME.
The idea of occasionally devoting the Applied Sci
ence general lecture period to a rehearsal of school 
songs is a good one and ought to be carried out.
Judging from the favorable criticism and the en
thusiastic and whole hearted manner with w'hich the 
students of that school participated in the singing 
exercises at the last general lecture period which 
was devoted to that purpose, a change of this kind 
appears to be heartily welcome. The general lec
ture idea in the first place was well conceived, the 
lectures delivered so far, being of a very interesting 
character and it can be said truthfully that the stud
ent has always looked forward to them.
No doubt, this still further elaboration to the ex
tent of (Jevoting one of these periods to the students 
themselves will give added interest to the general 
lecture course. It is to be hoped that Mr. Leete will 
see to fit to act on this his hinted scheme.
In using a lecture period for this purpose, it would 
be well, sometime beforehand, to figure out a suit
able program to be followed which will permit of no 
pause in the exercises and no loss of time.

SENIOR STATISTICS.
Voting Closes After Exciting Contest 
The Results
The Seniors have expressed. themselves for all 
time on the momentous questions concerning the 
Faculty, themselves and other pertinent and imper
tinent subjects. The voting throughout was close 
and exciting and in three cases a tie resulted for hon
ors. Standing out conspicuously was the one case 
in which all the senoric minds agreed. McCorkle 
was unanimously declared the best fusser in the 
class. More power to him.
The handsomest man was voted to be Kennedy, 
although several other candidates were in the field.
Porter was declared to be the most eccentric, 
Fisher, Crownover and Bascom running close be
hind.
For the most popular man, Bright and McCorkle 
fought it out to a pretty finish, Bright winning by 
a narrow margin. Lawrie coming in third.
The much sought after title of the grouchiest man 
was carried off by Bascom without much of a strug
gle, Crownover being the main contender.
Gettman and Porter were tied for the best natured man in the class, Molly Kennedy showing 
strength at the close of the polls.
Handford was another handy winner in the wind
iest man race. Dittman was left some distance be
hind and Reed could not be found at all after the 
first five minutes.
Dyer, McCartney, Fsher and Lawrie ran a close 
race after the title of laziest man, finishing in the or
der named, the entire electrical section betting on 
Dyer.
For the biggest grafter, Wallace and Waxman 
tied. Bascom in third place not far behind. The 
civils picked Bascom to win and were much disap
pointed.
McCorkle wras declared the biggest fusser, no one 
having the courage to run anyone against him.
Wallace was pronounced the best bluffer, receiving 
all the votes except his own, which was cast for 
Kennedy.
McCorkle was voted the class athlete with almost 
no opposition. It seems to be a habit of McCorkles 
to win easily.
The title of class grind was awarded to Waxman, 
Crownover being given an honorable mention. Muel
ler entered the race but soon stopped for a drink and 
was left behind.
Porter was declared to be the most religious 
man, Dittman coming in second and Lawrie third. 
Lawrie was protested on the grounds that is was 
not pure religion that drew him to church.
The race for the honor of being the wittiest man 
was close, Kennedy winning, Bell second, Bascom 
third. One joker said Witte should be declared the 
wittiest man anyway and refused to vote.
Kjems and McCorkle were declared tied in the 
contest for the title of ablest man and Porter 
was voted the least appreciated man in his class.
There was meek opposition to Seldon being de
clared the winner in the meekest man contest. The 
Seniors were pretty well agreed that Bright was the 
man who had done the most for his class.
In voting on the faculty the minds of the Seniors 
seemed to agree fairly well. Prof. Work came very 
near winning from Prof. Tinks as the brightest mem
ber, while Prof. Thayer ran a very close second to 
Mr. Pilkington as the most eccentric member, the 
results were as follows:
1. The most popular member, Prof. Keller.
2. Most broadminded member, Prof. Willett.
3. Brightest, Prof. Trinks.
4. Pleasantest, Prof. Hower.
5. Most polished, Prof. Hower.
6. Most eccentric, Mr. Pilkington.
7. The best lecturer, Prof. Keller.
8. The best teacher, Prof. J. C. Sproull.
9. The sleepiest lecturer, Prof. Sill.
10. The hardest to recite to, Prof. Wurts.
11. Gives the hardest exams, Mr. Dennison.
12. Does most for a fellow, Prof. J. C. Sproull.
The most surprising feature of the vote was the
choice of Bucky Wallace as the favorite actor. 
Mr. Wallace made his first appearance last fall in 
the Indifferent Husband. Later he appeared with 
Madam Bernhardt as Capt. Wienerschnitzel in 
LAiglon and as Monsieur De Chateau in Ca
mille. In the latter role he played a gambler and it 
is conceded he acted the part with splendid verisi
militude. To win out in this contest over such old 
favorites as John Drew and Robert Mantell argues 
well for the future of the stage.
If the Seniors meant what they said when they 
voted on the question of the favorite tobacco and 
cigarette they have cheap tastes. The tobacco de
clared to be their favorite was Five Bros., Mail 
Pouch also receiving a considerable number of votes. 
Sweet Caporal was voted to be the favorite brand 
of cigarettes.
The favorite amusement of the Seniors seems to 
be going to the theatre, and tennis was decidedly 
the favorite sport.
The Gazette-Times was declared to be the best 
local paper.
Miss Maude Adams was the choice of the Seniors 
for the position as their favorite actress.
TARTAN HEADQUARTERS.
Until a building common to all schools is built, 
such as the projected new administration building, 
the Tartan will have its headquarters in the com
mittee room of the Applied Science School. In which 
connection it would like to thank Mr. Orbin, the 
school supervisor of euipment, for the aid given in 
furnishing the room with a flat top desk for the use 
of the Tartan Board.

ANNUAL REPORT OF APPLIED SCIENCE 
STUDENT ROOMS COMMITTEE.
In the spring semster of 1909, Dean Leete gave the 
students of the Applied Sciense permission to use 
certain rooms as club rooms. Members of the differ
ent classes were appointed to take charge of these 
rooms. The expenses of furnishing and maintain
ing these rooms have been met by the different class
es and the present committee feels that some report 
should be given the work done and plans for the 
future.
The rooms have from time to time been decorated 
with pictures and banners of the various teams and 
clubs representing the Schools. We hope to be able 
to secure the pictures of all such teams and clubs 
in the future. The furniture has been given by the 
Schools and we hope each student will appreciate 
this and help take care of it.
We have recently obtained copies of periodicals 
and papers of the different schools throughout the 
country. These will be placed in binders and left 
in the Study Room.
We wish to acknowledge the receipt of several text 
books from Dean Leete and other of the professors. 
This forms the nucleus of our small library for which 
we would appreciate any donations.
A large picture of Mr. Carnegie is in view and we 
hope to have it framed and in place soon.
The committee hopes each and every student will 
take an interest in the club rooms and endeavor to 
make them not only useful but a pleasant place of 
meeting. We would also greatly appreciate any sug
gestions for the improvement of the rooms.

Elswehere in this issue can be found the program 
of the reception for Mr. Carnegie to be held Thurs
day evening, April 27th, at 8.00 p. m. in the Carnegie 
Music Hall. Everything that can be done to make 
this important event in our life as an institution 
go off smoothly has been or will be done. It now 
remains for the student body to turn out en masse 
and assure Mr. Carnegie of a royal welcome.
As a great institution we are in a rather particular 
and fortunate position, one which the student body 
does not realize and fully appreciate and we should 
be quick to take advantage of our situation. Of the 
other great educational institutions which owe their
life to one man or a group of men, only too few 
have intimate remembrances and recollections of 
their founders. We have, now,the opportunity to 
make for ourselves and those who follow us just such 
an event, one which can be incorporated in our his
tory and traditions. Moreover, few institutions have 
had the opportunity, such as we now have, of paying 
to their founder their tribute of esteem and love. 
Let us make the most of our opportunity by seeing 
to it that every one of us is in his place at this re
ception. Let us add to our history an event which 
will become with years the most dear to the hearts 
of Tech men.
Next week the Tartan will publish a special Found
ers Day number, containing a full program of 
events, special pictures of Mr. Carnegie and the 
various prominent men to be present. Several pic
tures of Mr. Carnegie taken at his last visit will also 
be printed. It is planned to have this issue out on 
Tuesday evening instead of on Wednesday evening. 
All copy must, therefore, be placed in the Tartan 
boxes by 9.30 Friday night to insure its publication.
Dean West being ill last week the Deans column 
is vacant this week. Dean West will, however, make 
her contribution next week.
CALL FOR CANDIDATES FOR TARTAN STAFF 
POSITIONS
The Tartan has decided to make an innovation, 
one for which it has the best of hopes.
There are several new members to be added to 
the Tartan staff for the year of 1911-1912. It has 
been customary for us to choose such men as we 
knew would fill our needs. We now propose to hold 
a competition for the places. All men in the Junior 
classes or below in any school being eligible. This 
competition will open Monday, April 24th and will 
run until Friday, May 26th, at which time the 
names of those chosen will be announced. All those 
desiring to enter are asked to speak to the editor-inchief, who will be in the Tartan office in the Com
mittee Room, Science Building, on Thursday, April 
20th, Friday April 21st and Monday, April 24th, 
from 12.00 to 1.00 oclock and . also on Thursday 
evening, April 20th from 8.00 until 8.30 oclock.
While student publications generally pick their 
men by this method, the Tartan never has thought 
that conditions here warranted doing so. We think, 
however, that there is much available material that 
can, if it will, show itself of great value. There
fore we urge every one who has the least interest 
or inclination towards the work to see the editor 
and talk the matter over with him.

THE TARTAN
INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION.
The following was an address presented before the 
students of the School of Applied Industries, on 
Monday, April 17, by Mr. P. Krenzpointer, the chair
man of the committee on Industrial Education, of 
the American Foundrymens Association:
To speak on industrial education at the Carnegie 
Technical Schools appears like carrying coal to 
New Castle or crows to Athens. However, much as 
this subject is being discussed there are certain feat
ures which deserve our attention since industrial 
education is still in an experimental stage in this 
country.
Industrial education is nothing new. What is new 
are changes in method and system of application. 
Greece and Rome had industries of a high order. 
The Roman roads which gridironed the South of 
Europe were of the most substantial kind. So much 
so, that portions of these roads are still in service
able condition after two thousand years. The Roman 
dispatch riders were able to make 170 miles a day 
over these roads. The mason of the time must cer
tainly have instructed the young mechanics w^ell or 
else they would not have been able to continue the 
work of their masters. During the Middle Ages trade 
instruction was very thorough and in European 
countries masterpieces of handicraft can be seen 
which no one has been able to duplicate. Later, 
when industries expanded governments were not 
slow to establish industrial schools. As early as 1751 
Austria established weavers schools and sent out 
traveling teachers to teach weaving to the village 
people.
Industrial schools were established in Bavaria 
and Munich, where I was born, in 1803 and these 
schools were of a high grade when I was an appren
tice from 1856 to 1861. And they were not voluntary 
schools, but every boy between 13 and 18 years of 
age, who did not attend any other school, was com
pelled by law to attend these schools. And they 
were held Sundays and holidays, not week days. 
Every Sunday from eight in the morning until half 
past five in the evening it was running from one 
school to another and the employer was made re
sponsible for the boys attendance. (Showing stamped 
chart, used by the lecturer in those days and coun
tersigned by the master every month, to illustrate 
how attendance was controlled.)
Modern industrial education has, or should have, 
four aims: Mechanical efficiency, technical effi
ciency, moral efficiency, civic efficiency. By mechan
ical efficiency we acquire skill of hand and manual 
dexterity. Technical efficiency aims at the acquisi
tion of technical knowledge and underlying scientific 
principles. All mechanical work is of a technical 
nature. Technic is physics and physics is natural 
science. Physics teaches theory. Technic makes 
practical use of theory.
The first savage man who tied his stone axe to a 
stick in order to get more work out of it, wras the
first engineer. By technical means he increased the 
power of his axe without understanding the underly
ing scientific principle. No matter how skillful a 
mechanic may be, unless he has some technical 
knowledge that will guide him to be economical with 
time and the material he is working with, he is not 
a first class workman. If he does not have that 
knowledge his work will be unnecessarily expensive 
by avoidable waste of time and material.
Here we come to the third aim of industrial edu
cation: the moral aim. Morality teaching was also 
one of the aims of industrial education during th 
Middle Ages and even in modern times. In fact, 
during the Middle Ages, when the boy lived with the 
family of his master, moral education received some
times more attention than his trade education. The 
master was made responsible for the mental, moral 
and physical welfare of the boy, hence the almost 
unlimited power of the master over the boy. The 
master had a legal right to whip the boy whenever 
he pleased. When I was an apprentice, my master 
being a mean man, he whipped us boys every day. 
One day he knocked me down senseless, pulled my 
ear so the blood would run and struck me in the 
nose and mouth so the blood would flow. My guar
dian tnought that was too much and brought suit. 
But the judge came up to me, slapped me on the 
shoulder, and said: Well, well, boys need a good 
wrhipping once in a while. And I had to go back to 
my master. In the industrial schools of Germany 
now one hour religious instruction a week is given. 
Since we have no state religion, w^e teach morality 
by arousing a sense of duty and responsibility. We 
aim to build up character. What is character? 
Through hourly and daily actions usages are formed. 
These usages grow into habits, habits determine our 
conduct and conduct is the foundation of a mans 
character. To be a man of good character requires 
will power, perseverance, patience, firm convictions. 
Now, let us see how character and industrial educa
tion are related to each other. Supposing you have 
acquired the mechanical skill to make a face-plate. 
A face-plate is an iron plate very true and flat and 
even and finely scraped upon which the accuracy 
of other work is tested. Now, in order to make a 
first class face-plate requires will power, patience 
and perseverance; all qualities of character. It re
quires an understanding that, if the face-plate is not 
true the work to be tried on it will not be true. And 
if the wrork is not true it is not good, honest work. 
Thus the mechanics moral sense of duty and re
sponsibility is the main spring of his character and 
exercise of will power to not only make a good me
chanical job, but make an honest job because if the 
work tried upon the face-plate is not good then the 
employer loses confidence in his men, and the con
sumer loses confidence in the manufacturer and says 
there is no longer any honesty among the mechanics 
of the day. There is another way of looking at this 
question. That is the conservation of our material 
resources. As population increases and our natural

---------------------------------------------------

12THE TARTAN
resources diminish in quantity, or quality, or both, 
competition between men and between sections of 
the country, or between different industrial countries 
becomes keeener and if we have the right sense of 
duty and responsibility we will understand that we 
hurt ourselves and our fellow citizens if we carelessly 
or ignorantly waste what resources there are left. 
If we have that moral sense of responsibility, then 
that will tell us that we ought to have technical 
knowledge to understand how to conserve and pre
serve as much as we can the raw materials used in 
the industries. Here is a piece of steel in the mak
ing of which the heater either had no character and 
sense of duty or he had no technical knowledge. 
He heated the billet of steel too quickly and 
scorched the outside, leaving the center compara
tively cold. Thus the outside layer of steel wras 
crushed upon the cold center and the resulting bar of 
steei was no good. Now, the steel maker had a con
tract with another firm to furnish these bars and take 
back whatever scrap was made. Thus because of 
the carelessness or indifference, or technical igno
rance of the heater a great deal of damage was 
done; the consumer lost confidence, the manufac
turer lost orders and the men lost work. Here is 
another piece of steel from a driving axle of a loco
motive. It shows why railroads are so very careful 
in testing all the materials used in service. If an 
axle with such a defect breaks there would be a se
rious and costly wreck. This is where scientific 
knowledge pays. Some time since I told the superin
tendent of a large machine shop that in his shop, 
and in other large shops for that matter, tens of 
thousands of dollars are wasted annually, not vicious
ly or willfully, but ignorantly because the men did 
not have the required technical knowledge to pre
vent waste. Now these tens of thousands of wasted 
dollars increased the cost of production of goods by 
that much. This made the goods dearer and many 
people could not buy the goods on account of that 
increased cost due to that avoidable waste. And the 
workmen lost that much of their earnings. And may 
be we could not compete with other countries on that 
account. Here is h punch cracked in hardening. 
That was avoidable. Tools are an expensive article 
to make and many avoidable breakages that way 
runs into money, increasing the cost of production. 
Nowadays a great deal of so-called high speed steel 
is used. It is expensive, costing 80 or 90 cents a 
pound and sometimes a dollar. Here is part of a 
tool made of high speed steel, ruined in grinding. 
The grinder had not technical knowledge enough so 
a fifteen dollar tool went to waste minus the value 
of scrap. So much for technical knowledge and 
sense of duty and moral responsibility in industrial 
education.
The civic aim of industrial education is expressed 
by saying that we all have obligations to each other. 
Selfishness is alright and we owe it to ourselves to 
get along as best we can and make the best out of us. 
Selfishness is the mainspring of human energy and
progress. But we cannot be prosperous unless the 
other members of the community are also prosper
ous. Our welfare is inseparably tied up with the wel
fare of all others. If the others are poor, we are 
poor. If all others are ignorant and only we are 
wise, our wisdon goes for naught. 'Hence it is our civ
ic duty to co-operate with each other. Especially 
is this civic duty necessary in municipal, state and 
national government. In the modern municipality 
all problems are technical problems. Sewering, pav
ing, lighting, waterworks are all questions of a high 
order of engineering. If the men elected to councils 
have no understanding of technical matters because 
the voters who elected them had no comprehension 
of the import of technical knowledge then there is 
liability of wast and grafting, waste of the tax pay
ers money, loss by the people in the integrity and 
honesty of their fellow beings and public institutions 
and there is dissatisfaction, strife and turmoil.
Recapitulation.
Purely mechanical skill and manual dexterity 
would be sufficient to carry on the industrial work as 
it is organized at present.
But we cannot stand still. Self-preservation urges 
us on to progress, and as we progress we invent, 
renew, change what is old to adapt it to new condi
tions of life. But to do this we require technical and 
scientific knowledge, insight into the necessity to 
prevent avoidable waste, to display character and 
will power to overcome difficulties, industry, moral 
backbone, sand, grit and ideals.
The mechanic and engineer more than ever con
trols the sanitary condition, the physical health and 
strength of the people. The wellbeing, comfort, con
tentment and happiness is largely affected by the 
knowledge of technical matters. Hence if industrial 
education is to be of real lasting social service to 
this and other generations it must be broad and deep 
enough to include in its teachings and methods me
chanical skill, technical knowledge, economic prin
ciples, character building and civic insight, duty and 
responsibility.

THE TARTAN13
CONVENTIONS TO BE HELD HERE.
That Pittsburghs fame as a desirable convention 
city is spreading has been recently attested by the 
action of two scientific bodies of national importance. 
Word has just been received by Director Hamerschlag that the Society for the Promotion of Engin
eering Education has selected Pittsburgh for its an
nual convention this year. The dates are June 27, 
28 and 29. The Society has officially accepted the 
invitation extended by the Faculty to use 
the facilities of the Schools for headquarters and 
meetings. The convention last year was held at the 
University of Wisconsin, and at Columbia the year 
before.
Plans for the 1911 convention are now being made. 
The local committee to handle the details has just 
been appointed by the Council of the Society. The 
chairman of the committee is Dean Leete, 
the other members are Mr. Charles F. Scott of the 
Westinghouse Electric Co., Dr. Bishop of the Uni
versity of Pittsburgh, and Dean Connelley and Pro
fessor Mott.
A new and interesting feature to be introduced 
this year will be the reunions of the faculty mem
bers from the various institutions represented in 
the Convention with their graduates located in this 
district. The very large number of college men hold
ing positions in the various local engineering plants 
makes it especially possible to schedule a convention 
feature of this description in Pittsburgh, with every 
prospect of success. Arrangements will also be 
made to visits and inspection trips to local points 
of interest.
The membership of the society is composed of 
representatives of the faculties of practically every 
technical school and state university in the coun
try, as well as a large number of practicing engin
eers.
The officers of the organization, which is nation
al in scope, are president, Professor Arthur N. Tal
bot of the University of Illinois; Vice president, Pro
fessor M. S. Ketchum of the University of Colorado; 
Secretary, Professor Henry H. Norris, of Cornell 
University.
The American Society of Mechanical Engineers 
has also chosen Pittsburgh for its annual conven
tion this year. Its professional sessions will be held 
at the Carnegie Institute from May 30th to June 2nd.
BASKET BALL LETTERS AWARDED.
The regular April meeting of the Board of Control 
was held on April 5. Although a quorum was present 
the number in attendance was not large enough to 
make proposed amendments to the Constitution.
The committee on an Inter-School Dance1 reported 
arrangements made and were instructed to proceed 
with their plans. The report of Manager Blanchard 
of the Varsity basket ball team was then heard, and 
the names of the men who earned their letters by 
playing in the required number of games were pre
sented to the Board. Nineteen games were scheduled 
for the season, making it necessary for a man to 
play in at least thirteen games to win an insignia. 
The men who fulfilled the requirements were, Keltz, 
Jordan, Kilgore, DuBarry, Saunders, Mandeville and 
Ray Williams. The board voted letters to these men 
and a managers insignia to Blanchard. It is to be 
regretted that Captain Jimmy Williams was unable 
to play in any of the out-of-town games, and was 
thus kept from winning a letter. Captain Williams 
played a good game at forward in all of the home 
contests and led the team in a creditable manner, 
his absence being felt in all of the games in which 
he was not present.
Mr. Duff, of last years tennis team, gave an inter
esting talk on the game and why the Athletic Associ
ation should adopt tennis as a minor sport.
The next meeting of the Board will be held on May
3, and every class in the schools should be repre
sented in the business to be transacted.
NEW COACH SELECTED.
Pitcher Wilson, a new recruit of the Pittsburg Na
tional League base ball team has been. appointed 
head base ball coach for the season, and has already 
assumed his duties. Mr. Wilson pitched two years 
ago on the team at Mercer University, Connecticut, 
and comes highly recommended. Captain Clarke, 
of the Pirates, introduced the new coach to the 
Athletic Association, and will allow him to spend all 
of the time possible with the Varsity team.
The squad has been considerably reduced by elimi
nation and hard work is in order for the remainder 
of the season. The positions of second base and 
the showing made against West Virginia on Satur
day and expect to have a winning team for the rest 
of the season. The positions of second base and

14THE TARTAN
We print below, according to the suggestion made 
at choral practice recently held, a copy of the words 
to the three songs which will probably be sung next 
Thursday night. It seems to us that every man 
should know these words by this time and if such 
is not the case let him see to it that he learns them 
by April 27th, at which time he will be expected to 
sing them.
The Glee Club is having printed a little booklet 
containing all Tech songs and a few general college 
ones. This book will soon be out and will be put on 
sale in the store rooms at a price just large enough 
to cover the cost of production.
WORDS OF SONGS.
ALMA MATER.
1. Let all our voices now be raised
In song to fill the air;
And all our hearts with music praise, 
Our Alma Mater fair.
Chorus.
Carnegie Tech, we honor thee,
And fondly sing thy praise;
We pledge our lives, in memory,
Thy sons on high to raise.
2. Let all the echoes ring out clear,
In joyful strains so true;
And greet the Tartan with a cheer, 
Red, yellow, green and blue.
Chorus.
3. Then keep our hearts ascending high,
Far reaching to the sky;
And make us thrill with pride in thee, 
Wherever we may be.
Chorus.
HAIL CARNEGIE.
1. Dear old Tech our song we bring thee 
And our hearts with love are filled 
In the praise of dear Carnegie 
May our voices neer be stilled,
And in praise to thee unending 
We will sing now loud and long 
With a will we raise our voices 
Inour Alma Mater song.
Chorus.
Hail Carnegie, we thy praise on high will sing, 
Loud our happy voices, swreet and clear will 
ring.
Queen of learning, we thy throne with palms 
bedeck,
Once again we praise thee with our song,
AH hail! Carnegie Tech.
2. And when we have left thy portals 
To the ends of earth to roam 
We will thinK of thee, Carnegie, 
Our beloved college home.
And our sons well give unto thee 
That they too may join the throng 
Singing in the mighty chorus,
This our Alma Mater song.
AMICI.
1. Our strong band can neer be broken, 
Formed in C. T. S.
Far surpassing wealth unspoken,
Ever more shall bless.
Chorus.
Amici asque ad aras,
Deep graven on each heart,
Shall be found unwavering true 
When we from life shall part.
2. College life at best is passing,
Heres to all success.
Then let us pledge in word and deed 
Our love for C. T. S.
BARNHART RESIGNS.
It is with the deepest regret that we announce the 
resignation of Curt Barnhart as secretary of the 
class of 13, Industries.
His resignation is due to the fact that he has 
purchased a plumbing and electric wiring establish
ment in Johnstown, his home.
At the first year meeting on Wednesday, April 12, 
he made his farewell speech to the class and turned 
his reports over to R. E. Rambo who was elected to 
succeed him in the officiai duties.
HINTS TO NEW MEN.
The following gentle hints which are dropped from 
time to time to technical students in one of the large 
electrical firms in this district may be of interest 
here:
1. Dont wear your Sunday clothes. Dont act like 
a visitor. Show from the beginning that you intend 
to make good. Peel your coat and go to it.
2. Dont attempt to explain to the Installer how 
you would do it. When you get a tool bag of your 
own, you will have plenty of opportunity for exer
cising your wits.
3. Think twice before you speak; look, listen, and 
workand if you have properly stirred up a sweat, 
you will have no wind left for gossip.
4. Telephone installing is dirty and hard work, 
and requires hard muscles, a trained hand, and a 
BRAIN. If you do not like this kind of work, either 
resign before you get a tin-plate souvenir attach
ment unsolicited, or stay at it long enough to secure 
promotion to a more desirable grade.
5. When you honestly feel that you can stand a 
raise, dont hesitate to write a letter asking for it.

APPLIED INDUSTRIES INSPECTION VISITS.
While the School of Applied Industries ran, as 
usual, during Easter week, the regular routine was 
relieved, somewhat, for the students in Electrical 
Equipment and Construction by inspection trips. On 
the afternoon of Monday, the 10th, section B-l of 
the lower class visited the supply house of the Doubleday-Hill Electrical Company, 919 Liberty Ave. 
This is one of the largest concerns of its kind in 
the United States and the boys were impressed by 
the great variety and immense quantities of elect
rical materials crowded into its eight story build
ing. Following this the class was taken to the 
factory of the Pittsburgh Electrical and Machine 
Company, Barger Place, and shown some of the kinks 
in switchboard construction, a novel sample of which 
was the new switchboard for the Metallurgical La
boratory now in course of construction there.
Wednesday afternoon, the upper class and specials 
were taken to the Stupakoff Testing Laboratories, 
and the Doubleday-Hilll Electric Companys arma
ture winding and Repair shops, both in the Bindley 
Power Building at Shadyside Station.
This was a wonderfully instructive and interesting 
trip. In the Stupakoff Laboratories were to be seen 
the finest instruments of percision for electrical and 
thermal testing. What appeared to be common 
glass tubes were handled very gingerly when the 
proprietor explained that they were drawn quartz 
tubing and worth from five to twenty-five dollars 
each.
In the Doubleday Hill Repair shop were many 
crippled machines in various stages of repairs, and 
the intricacies of commutator building, coil wind
ing, etc., were to be seen more satisfactory than in 
larger factories. 
All the visits were greatly enjoyed, and the court
esy of the proprietors thoroughly appreciated.
Enough for once.A boy twelve years old with an 
air of melancholy resignation, went to his teacher 
and handed in the following note from his mother 
before taking his seat:
Dear Sir: Please excuse James for not being pre
sent yesterday.
He played truant, but you neednt whip him for it, 
as the boy he played truant with and him'feel out, 
and he licked James; and a man they threw stones 
at caught him and licked him; and the driver of a 
cart they hung onto licked him; and the owner of a 
cat they chased licked him. Then I licked him when 
he came home, after which his farther licked him; 
and I had to give him another for being impudent 
to me for telling his father. So you need not lick him 
until next time.
He thinks he will attend regular in future. Dun
dee Advertiser.
The Italian of it.The professor says that music 
owes a great deal to Rossini, said the young woman. 
Whats Rossini?
That, replied Mr. Cumrox, is probably Italian 
for rosin. Washington Star.

HusbandAt the counter where the sweet little 
blonde works? The one with the soulful eyes

with extraordinary freedom.

BASKET BALL GAME.
The last basket ball game of the inter-class series 
was played on Monday, March 27. The Seniors met 
the Plebes on the field of battle, each team determ
ined to win or die. But the Plebes. let it be remarked 
were rather more audibly determined than the Sen
iors, who were distinguished by their customary mod
esty. At the end of the first half, the score was 6-4 in 
favor of the Plebes. But a hard and bitter battle 
in the second half resulted in a victory for the Sen
iors.
The game was well attended by faculty and stud
ents, and the enthusiasm displayed was exceedingly 
gratifying.
Following is the line-up:
Seniors 18 Plebes 15
Long........................................F ......................................Pardoe
Stewart..................................F..........................................Little
Schmidt..................................C ....................................... Jack
Clark.......................................SC ..................................Roberts
Craighead.............................G ........................................Jonap
Flinn........................................G ....................................Wentzel
Field goals: Long 6; Stewart 1; Pardoe 3; Little
3. Foul goals: Long 2; Stewart 2; Little 1.
The championship in basket ball is therefore 
claimed by the Seniors, who have not been defeated 
once during the series.
MAY FESTIVAL.
The three classes of the Margaret Morrison School 
are showing a lively interest in the preparations for 
the May Festival. Reta Kempel is the Queen of 
May, Helen Baglin, Winter, is consoled for her loss, 
of dominion by Florence Callen, who takes the part 
of Time. Each class is to present two dances for 
the delight of the May Queen. There is the bluster
ing North Wind and the gracious, gentle South. Prac
tise for the affair is well under way, and if it con
tinues as it has begun, the festival will be a great 
success.
