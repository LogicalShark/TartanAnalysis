OFFICIAL SELECTED FOR REC
OMMENDATION TO BOARD 
OF TRUSTEES.
The jury award and competition for 
the official seal will unanimously rec
ommend to the Board of Trustees the 
design submitted by Tiffany & Com
pany of New York.
The jury met last Monday and se
lected the Tiffany design. The de
sign is circular in shape, decorated with 
the thistle, and bearing the lettering, 
Carnegie Institute of Technology, 
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, 1912. My 
Heart is in the Work, Andrew Car
negie, 1900. The lamp of learning 
is also an element of decoration. The 
Tartan hopes at no distant date to be 
able to run a cut of the recommended 
design.
CARNEGIE CAMP.
Last week was a very busy week at 
Camp Louise Carngeie. The Sopho
more Civils under the jurisdiction of 
Messrs. Stanton and Lose and some 
students from the mining department 
under Mr. Griswold have spent a busy 
time up there. All report having had 
a very good time.
The Civils spent the week survey
ing the estate, laying out fields, roads, 
etc. The weather during most of 
the week was excellent and was ex
actly suited to this kind of work hence 
excellent progress was made. The 
miners inspected the local coal mines 
and made a few experimental tests 
on blasting.
during the week the camp was visited 
by Dean Leete, Dean Connelly, Pro
fessor Mott, Mr. Dosey and Mr. and 
Mrs. Lightcap.
The old mansion house presents an 
entirely new appearance, having been 
remodeled during the past few 
months.
Captain Henderson now makes his 
headquarters at the house and enter
tained the visitors royally.
Stevens Institute evidently does not 
give much credit to Pittsburghs new 
filtration system, as is evidenced in 
the following article about their in
spection trip.
Special Warning:
It is not safe to drink local water 
anywhere, especialy in and about 
Pittsburgh and Niagara Falls. Pur

AMERICA TO HAVE INTERNA
TIONAL CONGRESS OF AP
PLIED CHEMISTRY.
ROOSEVELT WINS 
STRAW VOTE.
The Eighth International Congress 
of Applied Chemistry was invited to 
this country by President Taft at the 
solicitation of the American chemists. 
It will be held in Washington and 
New York in September of this year. 
Dr. James, head of the Chemisttry 
Department, is a member of the com
mittee on finance and organization.
The congress will be made up of 
twenty-four sections and it is esti
mated that upwards of 1000 thousand 
papers will be presented. The past 
Congress was held in London in 1909 
and there were 985 papers presented 
at it, 41 countries being represented 
with a total membership of 4,100. The 
American chemists expect to use 
every effort to make this coming 
congress a worthy successor in every 
respect to those that have gone be
fore.
THISTLE COMING.
The 1912 Thistle Board greatly re
grets the fact that The Thistle did not 
appear on April 8th, but in spite of 
the care that was taken, delays occurred 
which made it impossible to have the 
books. The printer has added a 
night force, and for the past week 
has been working night and day to 
have the books appear in plenty of 
time to distribute to the night stu
dents.
The sheets will be sent to the bin
ders on Monday, April 15th, and the 
first 100 copies should be ready for 
distribution on Wednesday, April 17th, 
and continue at the rate of 100 to 150 
per day. This will give ample op
portunity for every person to get 
their books.
Lest you forgethave you arranged 
for the treasurer of your class club, 
or fraternity to pay for your cut in 
The Thistle. Are you sure that your 
last years bill has been paid?

The University of Wisconsin senior

The first college paper ever publish
ed in the United States was at Dart
mouth. The name of the paper was 
The Gazette, which was published 
for the first time in August, 1799. 
Daniel Webster was a contributor at 
one time.
Gets 278 Votes to Tafts 103.
Honour Economic Students of the 
University of Arizona have been call
ed upon to assist the local legislature 
in the preparation of new laws.
In the straw ballot taken by The 
Tartan on the Thursday before school 
closed for the Easter recess, Mr. 
Roosevelt was most decidedly the 
choice of the students voting. Mr. 
Taft following him with 103 votes. 
Ex-President Wilson of Princeton 
gave the President a good run for 
second place, receiving only 17 votes 
less, or a total of 86. Mr. Bryan, 
despite all that has been written about 
him, still has the first place in the 
minds of 19 of the students. The Ohio 
students, some of them at least, seem 
to hold the opinion that the governor 
of their state, Mr. Harmon, would be 
entirely satisfactory as a President 
and gave him their vote to a total of
10. Senator LaFollette also had ad
mirers about the voting students and 
received 31 votes. Speaker Clark 
made a rather poor showing, getting 
only 13 votes, while Mr. H. Under
wood did a little worse by getting 
only one. According to the returns, 
Mr. Roosevelt would be the Republi
can candidate and would run against 
Mr. Wilson on the Democratic side.
The Socialists proved to be fairly 
strong. Mr. Debs was the choice of 
19 of the partys representatives in 
Tech while others did not care partic
ularly who the nominee was and 
marked their ballots in a fashion 
something like this: Socialistic Can
didatewhoever he may be.
Three members of the faculty were 
honored by complimentary votes, Mr. 
Geckler getting 15, Prof. Hower two, 
and Mr. Dorweiler one. In view of 
the large number polled by Mr. Geckeler when his name was not on the 
ballot, The Tartan humbly suggests 
his name as Vice President. The 
ticket thus placing him would be as
sured of the solid Tech vote.
The balance of the votes cast were 
scattered. The complete results were 
as follows:
Republican.
Mr. Roosevelt ......................................278
Mr. Taft ..............................................103
Mr.LaFollette ..................................... 31
Mr. Hughes ......................................... 10

THURSDAY MORNING 
LECTURE.
On Thursday, March 28th, the 
speaker at the regular hour was Mr. R. 
W. Balson, a graduate of Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology, and at pres
ent connected with the Balson Sta
tistics Organization of New York 
City, who spoke on The Business 
Conditions which effect the Engi
neer. Since 1903 Mr. Balsons com
pany has been engaged in collecting 
statistics showing the total amount 
of business transacted in the country 
and founded on the basis of banks. 
By means of charts and maps, the 
business man is able to foretell what 
will happen in the financial and in
dustrial world from what has already 
taken place.
There are two ways of anticipating 
the future by maps showing where 
the greatest activity has been and is 
therefore likely to take place again, 
and by studying the rise and fall of 
the volume of business as compared 
to the normal increase.
Since 1903 careful records have 
been kept of these conditions, and it 
has been found, everything consider
ed, that there is a steady increasein 
business. Mr. Balson exhibited a 
large chart on which this increase was
shown by a gradually rising line.
Against this line of normal growth 
had been plotted on the ordinate the 
actual fluctuations of the total amount 
of business. This gave a curve which 
was sometimes above and sometimes 
below the growth line. Years were
plotted on the abscissae and the curve
brought out the following remarkable 
facts: That after any national calam
ity, such as the San Francisco earth
quake or times of panic, the volume 
of business fell off suddenly, but 
gradually ascended again to the line 
of normal growth; also, altho the 
shapes of the spaces above and below 
this line were essentially different, 
the areas included by it were the same, 
thus proving that the total business of 
the country is steadily increasing, The 
main point brought out by the curve 
was that all the area above the curve 
meant over-expansion, over-produc
tion and for all that business goes 
above the line of normal growth, it 
must go just that far below at some 
future time. For the last two or 
three years there has been no abnor
mal growth nor depression, so it is 
safe to predict that there will be no 
exceeding hard times or panics in the 
immediate future.
Mr. Balson further made the re
markable statement that ones salary 
does not depend upon the conditions 
where one is employed: that the sal
ary in any business will depend upon 
the volume done in every other line,

The sophomore contest for the two 
places on the staff of The Tartan 
closed Friday, March 29th. The Tar
tan is pleased to announce that, as 
a result of this contest, it adds to its 
staff Mr. H. P. Smith, of the School 
of Applied Design, and Mr. J. H. 
Esselink, of the School of Applied 
Science.
THAT CIVIC CLUB.
As was stated in the last issue, The 
Tartan is of the opinion that a civic 
society of some form or other would 
prove a valuable addition to our stu
dent activities. As a result of the 
straw vote taken on the presidential 
situation, The Tartan is even more 
strongly than ever under the belief 
that an organization of this nature 
would be a decided success if once 
started. There were nearfy six hun
dred men who took enough interest 
to cast a straw vote. Surely 50% of 
these, or three hundred, would be in
terested in hearing a real live speaker 
once a month discuss the questions 
of national, state and city politics, and 
a club with a charter membership of 
three hundred would be some club.
It needs some one who is willing 
and able to take the initiative and 
start the movement. Where is he? 
---------------o---------------
As a result of a straw election con
ducted by the Purdue Exponent, 
Roosevelt received 225 votes, Wilson 
202, Taft 73, and Bryan 23 votes.
This club was organized for the 
purpose of promoting the interest in 
Wireless Telegraphy and Telephony 
and opens a new field of interesting 
study in the Carnegie Technical 
Schools. There are now many mem
bers in this organization and as mem
bership is open to any student, it is 
hoped that we will have many more 
in the near future. By the time this 
article is published a complete 2K W. 
station will be in operation and will 
be able to send messages to stations 
from 75 to 100 miles away and to reieive from stations 1500 to 2000 miles 
away.
Many interesting experiments have 
been carried on and two demonstra
tions have been given. The club 
would like to give one of its demon
strations before the whole school, 
such as blowing up ships, running 
cars, operating telegraph sets, starting 
fires, lighting lamps, blowing horns, 
etc.
Meetings are held every Wednesday 
at 4:15 P. M. in room 208, Applied 
Industries building.
The present officers are: Guy W. 
Fagan, president; Warren C. Cook, 
vice president; Casper Peppel, secre
tary and treasurer.
Any sudent in the Carnegie Tech
nical Schools is eligible for member
ship and is welcome at all meetings. 
Come out if you can only stay ten 
minutes.
REAL WORK FOR STUDENTS.
It Is No Secluded Life That the 
Candidates for a Forestry Degree

University of Minnesota next year. 
To obtain a diploma each student 
must for a time do the work of a 
lumber-jack, and walking boss. 
Among the things which he will have 
to learn are:
To snake logs with a yoke of 
oxen.
To fringe properly a pair of Macki
naw trousers.

COMMERCIAL POSTER 
CONTEST.
Design Students Get First and Third 
Prizes and Nine of the Eleven 
Honorable Mentions.
In the First Annual Commercial 
Poster Contest conducted under the

the students of this institution did 
exceptionally well, pbtaining the first 
and third prizes and nine of the 
eleven honorable mentions awarded. 
Milian Petrovits of the School of 
Applied Design, obtained the first 
prize of $100 with his poster for the 
Westinghouse motor. A. L. Sudek,

public is invited to attend.
NO LIMIT.
(By Godfrey Montague Lebhar) 
Ive kissed her pretty ruby lips,
Ive kissed her unawares;
Ive kissed her on the instant,
And Ive kissed her on the stairs.
Ive kissed her in the meantime,
Ive kissed her in the park;
Ive kissed her inadvertently,
And likewise in the dark.
Ive kissed her on the frontier,
And on the left ear, too;
When I couldnt kiss her often 
Id make her forehead do.
Ive kissed her on her bended knees, 
Ive kissed her on the cheek;
Ive kissed her by the rivulet,
Ive kissed her by the week.
Ive kissed her little nose so much,
How much she little knows;
Ive kissed her pretty often,
And Ive kissed her pretty toes.
Say, when I get a-kissing her, 
Theres nothing I wont do;
Ill kiss her with abandon,
YesWithout a band on, too!
No, theres nothing I would stop at 
When once Im in the swirl;
Why, Id kiss her in the bathtub 
My six months baby girl!

4THE TARTAN
j WHATS WHAT AND HOW. |
The Schools crop of gol-uf enthu
siasts will soon be ripe (not edible 
even when pasteurized). The air will 
reek, shortly, with the corrugated j 
quinine pills; riotous fragments of golf j 
clubs; meteoric gobs of turf, mutilated 
selections from Scotch sporting vo
cabulary, and denatured profanity.
In two weeks the face of the Pitts
burgh Club links will have more scars 
than the countenance of an English 
suffragette.
The local devotees of this chippenj 
dale form of sport are beginning to \ 
refer to a quartette as a foursome | 
and to yell four' at the unwary pedestrian who threatens to run down 
an automobile. The landscape will be 
decorated with statuesque figures in more or less devout attitude posed 
before a tiny altar of sand on which 
the small white sacrificial victim lies 
in state. The devotee after certain 
mysterious passes with a deformed 
club seems to be suddenly seized 
with a berserker rage and smites wild
ly at the pallid image 011 the mound 
and when the spectators have dug 
the vagrant sod out of their eyes the 
image is still there serene and smiling. 
The assault is repeated with like re
sult until some sarcastic witness of 
the abortive tragedy suggests that it 
is a stick of dynamite and not a golf 
stick that is needed.
In the course of time, by the ine
vitable law of chance, a mighty wing 
lands, and the ball hobbles fully forty 
feet and settles down comfortably in 
the ditch. But its persecutor pounces 
on it, bullies it, beats it with assorted 
shillalahs, hangs on its trail relent
lessly, and finally herds it back to the 
home plate in the gloaming, mangled 
beyond recognition, and with its mor
als mined by the conversation it has 
overheard.
It sure must be a thrilling experience 
to escort a helpless spherical body 
over the banks and braes, occasionally 
pushing it into a hole when off its 
guard, meanwhile holding sweet con
verse with a Chesterfieldian antagonist 
concerning golf trousers with a Cale
donian brogue, the kinetic energy of 
the projectile, the graph of its more 
or less eccentric path, the moment of 
inertia (or rather the hours of inertia) 
of the blase caddy and the need of a 
larger factor of safety in golf sticks. 
You could never look unmoved upon 
the spectacle of your professor ad
dressing the ball. The address seems 
to consist largely of gestures and foot 
work, but Lavcoon has nothing on 
the addressor in the line of fancy con
tortion. Meanwhile his implacable op
ponent stands by in worshipful ad
miration and when the operation is 
completed and the patient recovering 
anywhere from fifty to one hundred 
feet away, he takes the platform and 
tries to go his predecessor one better 
in dissolute delsarte.
Golf cannot be said to be a danger
ous game. In fact its disciples in-j 
variably attain an antiquity disgusting 
to their heirs, if they escape the rav
ages of hook worm.
The so-called contests are seldom 
fatal, except to score keepers and |
caddies and to an occasional specta
tor.
Prayer meeting preceding contests, 
the latest innovation in football, will 
never be popular, except for onlook
ers where trees are scarce. Prayer 
may be efficacious in promoting for
ward passes and line bucks, but it 
would rarely prevent a foozle.
With comparatively little aid from 
Archaeology, we have reached the 
momentous conclusion, that this game 
was popular with our late lamented 
ancestors of cave-dwelling proclivi
ties; in fact, was invented by them. 
They, without doubt, used the same 
club, that was devoted to business 
purposes and social amenities, and 
for a ball they ingeniously adapted 
skull, not being particular whether 
its original owner was entirely 
through with it or not.
I11 the exigencies of the struggle, 
when the ball is shattered under a 
savage drive, having possibly been the 
crown piece of some primitive poet 
(or teacher, perhaps), the game would 
be delayed only so long as was re
quired to stalk on unpopular and un
wary neighbor to borrow his heedless 
coco."

mining and sanitary engineering.
School of Applied DesignOffers courses in architecture, 
interior decoration, illustration and painting, open to both 
men and women.
School of Applied IndustriesOffers industrial courses in 
machine construction, building construction, and elec
trical equipment and installation. Short courses are offered 
in the various trades for applicants with experience. A 
new course to equip men as teachers in manual training 
and in trade school work is also offered. The increasing 
demand for such men provides an attractive field for the 
progressive young mechanic and the public school teacher
Margaret Morrison Carnegie SchoolFor women only/ 
Offers courses in household economics, secretarial work, 
dressmaking, and costume illustration and design. Be
cause of the demand for trained teachers, graduate courses 
are offered for those who wish to prepare for the many 
positions now open for women in these newer lines of work.
Night CoursesThe four schools offer night courses in 
practically all of the above subjects to provide educational 
opportunities for those who are at work during the day.
