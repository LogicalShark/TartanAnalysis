SCHOOL LBOXBES
-The customary'lecture series condnctd-by' 
tie school ot intervals thrughont the year has 
,.b&en noticeably absent this term; this of course 
hoa been necessitated by.the lack of funds. The 
recent col confrence, .was the'..prin<ap࣒sburc 
of the exhaustion of this particular appropriation, and it proved to be a most worthy cause, 
having beon successful in every detail.
 However, it would seem that this condition 
need not moke the discontinuance of the lec
tures necessary. Why not have a series of 
addresses by the various professors and'department heads of .the school itself? Some of .the 
most noted men in' their' particular line are in
cluded among the staff of Carnegies instrucWe have noticed in our various exchanges 
that lectures by .professors connected with the 
school are not uncommon, many of th -larger 
institutions,of both United States and Canada

\The large fild of science/ art nd what not, 
included, in .Carnegies curriculum, offersmen 
within its owh staff who should be capable of 
giving interesting lectures in almost .any line 
of art, science or various phases of industry.
A lecture series of this.kind would not only 
offer a solution to the present problem of con
tinuing the; policy of former years, but it 
would also give'students of" various.' depart
ments an opportunity to learn about the work 
of the entire school. It would offer ,an oppor
tunity of expression for instructors and de
partment heads. In short, it seems a bit un
necessary. to practically discontinue the school 
lectures with the available talent which the 
teaching staff of Carnegie includes.
CARAECA
CONCERNING SCHOLARSHIP
One of the most vital problems that the edu
cator of today has to contend with is a lack 
of interest in scholarship. Not; only is this 
fault noticed in the elementary student, but it 
is alarmingly apparent in the college student. 
The tendency on our own campus has been to
get 8way from intensive study, but acide from 
that, .there are few who really strive to be 
scholastically eminent.. That is to. say, the; 
average student is content to go to classes, pass 
his courses if possible, and have as good a. time 
as possible.
'i .Thcrc isi nei great cause .for alarm in this 
situation, which is felt not only at Carnegie 
Tech, but thro^out th country. The desire 
to. pass ones coures is certainly laudable, and 
th irudent who suodeedsl in this is entitled to 
'his sheepskin. ' But' here is another angle. Sup
pose every' etudent had an ambition to make 
high marks in every subject. Would not both 
the studentand the faculty profit?
It has been.suggested that a. scholastic hon
orary be founded) to be common-to the four 
colleges, Margaret Morrison,-Arts, Engineering 
and Industries. Selections to this honorary 
would be.wholly on the basis of scholarship; a 
selection into which neither activities nor per
sonal prejudice would enter, as they do in 
most of our honoraries here established. Only 
senior students, perhaps the highest ten of each 
school for the first three years,- would'be eligi,L 
ble to wear the-emblem of this society. Ob
viously, such a selection could .only be made'by 
the .faculty.
The proponents of thiB plan feel that it 
would furnish a stimulus toward higher schol
arship; that the' honor of wearing such an em
blem would be highly coveted,, and would in
spire the underclassman^ to stronger efforts.: 
Crthily; 'there' i3 ^De mrit' in th jplan'/but' 
is the appeal strong enough to produce the de
sired results! Wc fear that the answer is no. 
There are at present a number of honoraries, 
too many in the eyes/of some, that every year 
pledge the best men of the da5s. And yet, because the basis of selection is not scholarship 
alone, there is a feeling that the latter is not 
quite as important as it should be.
So we have our problem.. The .solution must 
be worked out by the student himself.' Theo
retically, there should be no incentive needed 
to make the 6tudent tetrive for ' high scholar
ship. We come to college for development, 
cially and mentally.,-We strive earnestly for 
maximum social'recognitiOn ; why not the si 
scholastically ?

that the Dinosaur room in Carnegie

sanctum to science and a pantheon 
to palaeontology, for here are as

of the gods.
It was an age that was vastly 
different from our age; the Arctic 
- was like Africa. Icebergs have 
since supplanted the palm trees, 
and snow-drifts have taken the 
place of the hot* turning eands of 
the deserts, and it wus also an age when pineapples grew to he the size of barrels, and cherries assumed the proportions ot the present day orange. The -gods were as - yet young and their experiments seem to us as being grotesque: the stage was not yet set for the entrance of the* gods
pleased with these monsters of their making, for they blew out their flame of life by obliterating them, and it was not until fifty years ago that their grave-vard was. discovered in a far western state; when scientists, prodding about Jn the hard rock, came upon . the petrified bones and carefully removed them, it seemed likely that the lost pages ot a precious

A vigorous concerted attack on President. Cooildgea course with respect to Mexico and Nicaragua was made by the Democrats la
Twe benators -charged that the protection oC the big American oil interests and the intention to get furCSer olt concessions was at thebottom. of tbe President's policy, while in the House a resolution %aa offered by Representative | Huddleston of Alabama calling on the President to withdraw its armed forces from Nicaragua. Many of the European newspaper have criticized this country for the use of fiorce in regard to. this small country, while others 
stated that It is our duty tor nteresThe outcome ut th present time 3 uncertain, hut it appears th&c the difficulties which we bad lately in regard to Mexicos policy in the case of American oil Interests important bearing e; gre ! ishave a break with Mexico.
