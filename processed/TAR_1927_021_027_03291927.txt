THE BIETH OF A COLUMN
The Tabloids are fast taking it up, many a 
semi-reputable paper isiinuking about brand
ishing one; in fact, ivell be surprised and no
ticeably disappointed ' if such neholarly 
sheets as the CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONI
TOR and' tlie NEW YORK TIMES do not 
throw their ideals to. .the winds and indulge. 
It 4s pouitively a knockout ns an educative 
sjjunt, its influence ou the paper reading pub
lic is already so intimate, that a friend of nine 
has rightly pronounced *it'to be a "wow. 
Within the last month a book lias been pub* 
lisbed telling all about it. And now the Tar
tan takes inventory of its pages, carefully 
weighs.-the glory (sure to be a by-product of 
such, a \ veuture), ^giiinst the few ideals which 
may be knocked into limbo, and lo, next week 
we shall have an Ask Me Another" column.
' A certain number of questions will be asked 
each week, the same to be answered in the fol
lowing issue, together with a new list of ques
tions. The whole scheme is simple and compre
hensible to even, the least among us. The sue-; 
'cess of rthe column, depends, of course, ou our 
leaders and. their queatious. The columnist is 
wise and oracular, but ho has no time to 
bother with monkey-shines. From . time to 
time the questions will' be answered by varioua profe; their ratings will give tone and autlr6rijy..to tho eoluaui. I

Catechizing, a Substitute Form of Dissipation
For the Abused Acrostic arid Cross-Word Puzzle
By HAROLD JACOBSON
Catechising hae been lately in. stored as an amusement by those who have grown weary of the 
acrostic and the cross-word puzzle. This form of dissipation was originated by none other than the ancient Aristotle. who, In the /fourth century, B.  C., aggravated the Athenians In. the Lyceum with the peripatetic jangle of Ask Me Anquestionable

. This. aeteUc 
means, of eliciting Information has become far. more fascinating <0 th 'wowsers' than the corrupting . convolutions or the Charleston or - to go further back, that antique fad . of Chinese tlddle-wJnks. With the Idea la Tlew of .spreading this gospel the writer lias assembled some questions, endemic to our own fatppus, whose answers ..are fihroud. ed 'lu as jnucb-myateryas was. the riddle of the Sphiox, and not until a. second Oedipus, comes alongwill'/their insolubility be olved.
The following questions havf . bn chosen from a collection ot a hundred or more. Some .of them can he answered by the wise In
stantaneously. while others win perhaps require weeks of concentrated thought Answers, If any, are to be sent post-paid.
'Question No. 1.Has there ever! been a living soul, with the excep:  lidn of one-.pereon. who' did not ! consider - course C-601. offered to . Freshmen as highly superfluous to | the natural order of ' curriculum . procedure?

Anxiety Caused by AntiForeign Agitation in

RUSSIA IN SYMPATHY
Editor Carnegie Tartan:
Dear SirYour very ableart 
critic, Kip, In his review of 
Th Dance of; Life puts ni in the dilemma-when'.I either . bave'to defend the play or be sishme for having allowed myself>to enjoy what he'labels'a mediocre and poor ! ot work. Not wishing to be cheated ont of a good tjm I must exception to Mr. Kips ; crltrd-The Dance ot Life Iry Mr. Otild/.whjh was recently, given at >ur theater.  -
First, r wish to make an addlIon to th factors which Mr. Kip numerates as responsible for the rerelotlon of the. mystery of life ;o the young njan. I mean the ractor of love. It .is difficult to 
iay whether the solitude of the prison cell, or the joy of the girls eyes.had a / greater share In his ultimate return to normal.llTe. 
s One might also give s different inlerpietatlon as to the dance element, which, according to Mr. Kip, means that the chler.aim in life haplness.. It suggested to' ,i E so much the aim of.life as rath the way to' attain that aim, whl 
may he happiness; not so much purpose as a> means. The way attain happiness in life is not stand by with an air of a die ted observer, coldly contemplating about it, but to 1 participant in It; among, the audience,.. but among
the cualn drops.

Shanghai ha6 been captured/ by the 'Cantonese Nationalist army, and there Is uncertainty bs to the' attitude* that they will ulimaely take in.'tegard to foreigners. It Is said ihat the success of tbe antl-forelgn agitation has made the Chinese more menacing than at any Boxer days. One porta from friendly Chinese  and foreign^ intelligence services Is the effect'that'an attack aganst French  and lnernatiobal sv ments Is planned. '
