TAYLOR WILL SPEAK
Attention to Be Given to 
Economic Side of 
New Processes
More than 2,000 of the world's 
leading authorities on bituminous 
coal will assemble at Carnegie on 
November 16 for the third inter
national conference on bituminous 
ioal.
The purpose of the conference, 
similar to that of the conferences 
Held in 1926 and 1928, is to pre
sent for discussion the results of 
recent studies of coal, emphasizing 
improved methods of utilization and 
their economic value. Because of 
the world-wide depression in the 
coal industry, particular attention 
will, for the first time, be given 
1 the economic side-of new processes 
and developments discussed during 
the meetings.
The major topics which will be 
presented for discussion and ex
change of ideas include the status 
of low and high temperature dis
tillation of coal, hydrogenation and 
gassification, cleaning and prepara
tion of coal, by-products, railroad 
and steamship fuel, smoke abate
ment, fertilizers, origin and classi
fication of coal and storage. The 
committee in charge of arrange
ments has made every effort to 
arrange a program which will make 
the survey of these topics interna
tional in scope. A group of dis
tinguished business men from both 
Europe and the United States will 
speak on .'the : business side or the 
coal industry. The chief member 
of this group is Myron C. Taylor, 
chairman of the Finance Commit
tee of the United States Steel Cor
poration.
Scientists and experts from 17 
countries will take part in the dis
cussion. As has been the case 
in the past, the papers and discus
sions at the conference will6 be 
edited and published. The proceed
ings of the two previous meetings 
arc now considered standard refer
ence works of the subject of Fuel 
Technology.
The conference is open to 1 the 
public. Individuals and organiza
tions interested in the problems of 
the coal industry are invited to 
participate either by contributing 
papers, by attending the confer
ence, or by sending delegates.

Seriously Speaking
A Column of World News Events 
By NATHAN MILLER
A Sick World To Be 
Operated Upon
The Elder Statesmen have fail
ed us. In the midst of a world 
sick and weary with aggravated 
economic and political distress, all 
we can get out of our natural 
leaders is, a continuous stream of 
old saws and antiquated blather. 
.What a miserable bankruptcy of 
ideas and effort is exhibited by 
those entrusted with the guidance 
of our democracies. But it is 
rather too much to expect that 
those who rode the machine into 
the whirlwind will now stoop to 
picking tip, the pieces and putting 
thcni together again.
Strangulation from an excess of 
good health, causing congestion in 
the brainthis has its analogy in 
the industrialism of our times. The 
financial and commercial magnates 
that set up the system from which 
we suffer now did not heed the 
consequences pi ' their, bold 2-ncL
reckless exploitation of the land 
and its riches. They believed oft
en that they worked for their 
children but like most fond par
ents shot much beyond the markin believing that their world was 
satisfactory for their children and 
that it could last forever.
The heroic figures of the pi
oneer, -the empire-builder, the 
backwoodsman pass into legendary 
lore, but it is.time to realize that 
they were men who wasted as 
well as built, who were profligate 
as well as self-denying. They had 
great dimensions and energy but 
'puny foresight and discretion. A 
land is despoiled as it is exploited. 
It is only now that we seek in 
vain for the rationale, the plan, or 
the direction all this sweating and 
labor was to take.
A dilemma is thus upon uswe 
inherit an economic, social and 
political structure replete with 
self-contradiction ; progress and 
poverty, power and impotence,

ROBBERIES HIT 
4 FRATERNITIES
Daring Thief Takes' Large 
Amount of Money
Some daring person, or persons, 
executed a series of robberies 
among the fraternity houses on 
Forbes street early Thursday morn
ing, taking in all about three hun
dred dollars. The houses entered 
were; Tlieta Xi, Delta Upsilon, 
Sigma Phi Epsilon and Kappa Delta
Kho.
About 7 oclock Thursday morn
ing at the Tlieta Xi house several 
of the members who had.rooms on 
thesecond lloor noticed that their 
personal effects had been disturbed 
and that they had all been relieved 
of a considerable sum of cash. A 
further investigation led to the dis
covery that the entire second floor 
had been covered and that in every 
room someone reported the loss of 
money. The intruder evidently was 
only after money for jewelry and 
clothing remained undisturbed. A 
total of about o'ric, hundred dollars 
was taken. The case was the sa,mc 
in all houses entered, for the rob
ber passed up jewelry and clothing, 
taking only cash.
The Intruder made ;i thorough 
sweep at the Delta Upsilon house, 
carrying away about one hundred 
and twenty-live dollars in cash be
longing to the members rooming 
on the second floor.
At the Sigma l.hi Epsilon house 
the robber took a heavy toll.

Dr. Ross, Economics Professor,
Presents Views On European Crisis
"mgPrices, Return of Prosperity, Happy Days, 
to Come By Way of Europe; No 
Good News As Yet
Iii an interview with the Tartan, 
Dr. Ross, Professor ^>f Economics 
at Carnegie, who recently returned 
from Europe, presented his views 
on the present Situation of eco
nomic stress. Rising commodity 
prices, the return of prosperity and 
happy days for the business man 
when they come will come by wai 
of Europe <and Asia unless the 
United States is to become a self 
sufficient economic unit with great
ly curtailed foreign trade. At pres
ent there  is unfortunately little 
good news from these regions. Asia 
is in the throes of famine and war 
while'- Europe staggersunder a 
succession of rude jolts that fall 
with increasing regularity as the 
months pass.
The belated discovery of the well 
known state of German insolvency 
by the innocent investor in the mid
dle of the summer and this con
sequent; flight from. Abe mark did
no one any good. Even'the French 
press which at the time bitterly as
serted that the Germans were 
merely feigning bankruptcy to 
escape debt payments now agree 
that the financial debacle was a 
genuine disaster for Europe,
Not even those investors who 
successfully, sold their German 
securities escaped with a whole 
skin. Many of them flew from the 
mark to the pound only to be 
caught by England's renunciation 
of the gold standard a few weeks 
later. In fact financial Europe is a 
house of cards. The German crash 
froze English credits in Germany 
and created a fear among owners 
of English securities that the gold 
reserves supporting the pound 
might be exhausted. This in turn 
caused the flight from the pound 
and the actual collapse of the gold 
standaid in England.

very keen for each girl wished to be 
on the winning team. After all ac

the fatigued athletes.
A large number of freshmen were 
present, and all enjoyed themselves

A Tartan defeat at the hands of 
a veteran Wash-Jeff varsity was 
partially avenged Saturday morn
ing when an unusually classy 
squad of yearlings, coached by 
Paul Allison, Johnny Karcis 
and Tank Highbcrger, decisively 
turned back the Proxy freshmen 
by a 13-0 count. The game .was 
played at the Taylor Alldcrdicc 
field.
The Little Washington young
sters, although boasting a heavier 
and harder charging line, were 
outclassed in every department of 
the game. Except for a few min
utes following the opening kickoff, they never had a chance. The. 
Plcbc hackficld was shifty and 
made frequent excursions around 
the red and black ends; the line, 
011 the other hand, appeared to
be too strong for the plaid to
penetrate.
Terrebus is Brilliant
Terrebus, a frail young man
who moves like a flash, opened 
the way for the first Tartan
touchdown early in the second 
period, when he made two succes
sive dashes of 35 and 15 yards, 
Mihm crashed over for the touch
down from the two-yard stripe. 
Plummer's place kick was perfect, 
and Carnegie led 7-0.
The plcbes continued to hold 
the upper hand throughout the 
second half, and shortly before 
the final whistle, Urban, subbing 
for Terrebus, tore off 35 yards for 
the final counter. The try for 
extra point was blocked, and the 
game ended 13-0.

NIGHT STUDENTS 
TO REGISTER 
OCTOBER 6-7-8
Gymnasium is Again Used 
For Registering Night 
Students
Yes sir, all you have to do to be
come famous is to say something, 
get yourself quoted in a daily paper, 
and .presto you have arrived. Pro
fessor Charles Gray Shaw of the 
New York University took this road 
lo fame and he has arrived, judging 
from all the comments which have 
been published since his famous statcanent%6 the effect that whistlers arc 
morons;-Gee that, was a long chance 
and the'professor certainly took his 
life in his own hands. Think of it, 
every time you hear a person 
whistling 3ou can say (according to 
Professor Shaw) he is only a 
moron. What a hornets . nest was 
disturbed. Ill bet the professor 
wishes 'lie had never made the state
ment that those persons who whistle 
are, devoid of moralstamnia and 
are the possessors of an inferior 
complex or. something like that. He 
further says that no great man ever 
whistles.  Well, I'd hate to believe 
that, because I have known some 
famous men who were continually 
whistling and vociferously too, when 
something annoyed them, or they 
were about to accomplish some big 
thing.
Im whistling now, (but Im not a 
great man, only an idle night stu
dent) yet Id hate to be put in the 
category that I belong to that great 
fraternity of moronssuggestions of 
Utah, and Salt Lake Cityor that I 
had an inferior convex or some like 
complaint. To. my mind, there is 
nothing like a good whistler. Some 
of them make more money for one 
performance than a half dozen pro
fessors do in a months time, and 
morons or not, the money they get 
certainly is not an inferior complex.
The professor goes on to say, (he 
must have a very keen car) that 
itherc are two types of whistlers, 
those who whistle thr'ough the , lips, 
nnd those, wlio whistle from the 
throat. Now if you happen to belong 
/to the former class, you arc low 
browed,' and not to be tolerated; on 
(the other hand if you should be able 
ito\. whistle from the throat, (like 
pome' famous birdfor instance, the 
nnagpic or crow) you have ascended 
the scale a little and perhaps in the 
rears to come you will be able to 
live down the stigma which is at
tached to the whistler.
I am wondering if the professor 
had in mind the old adage about the 
whistling, girl and just twisted his 
'imagination to include the men. The 
old saying 'was something like 
'Whistling girls and crowing hens 
alzvays come to a bad end. I have 
heard girls zvhislle too, and the mere 
fad that they, whistled did not make 
them any ihe':zvorse for the diver
sion. Von know, they have as much 
right to zvhistle as the men do, and 
bccause they do is no reason to say 
that they are mormons.
Ill bet the professor cant whistle 
a note, and since he cant perform, 
and since he is a professor, he puts 
all those who can down as being 
below him mentally. This is only an 
idea, but I have as much right to 
say this as lie has to say that all 
whistlers are possessed of inferior 
complexes. It seems to be the fash
ion these days to label those who 
are not as well versed as oneself 
with some sort of term which would 
denote the inferiority, hence the use 
of the word moron. My, but that 
word is worked to \]death. It is a 
lamentable fact, and I am wondering 
if, perhaps, those who do the judg
ing should not be classed as morons 
too many times these very people 
know only one or two things, and 
they become so engrossed with their 
subjects that they lose sight of the. 
fact that other people know some
thing to and are entitled to con
sideration.
Wliat a place this world would be 
without some sort of relief for the 
feelingswhistling furnishes thal-very 
thing, and because it docs, the one 
zvho indulges is condemned. Oh me 
thats life, if you do its wrong, and 
if you dont its wrongit all de'"'pends upon the viewpoint. Id rather 
hear a goo.d.. whistler any day than 
have ltd. listen to one of those 
kitchenette sopranoes or the sounds 
of o baratone emanating from the 
keyhole of a bathroom, yet I zuont 
class them as morons.
Whistling is an art which every
one cannot aspire to. Try as you 
will, if you dont have the ability, 
you cant accomplish the art. Think 
of classifying a person with the 
ability of whistling a selection of a 
famous composer as a moron. Either 
the word moron has a multitudinous 
number of meanings including the 
arts and an artist, or the professor 
 over shot the mark and is misusing 
the word.
This ccrtainly has bccome a 
whistling article. Never thought so 
much could be written about the 
pastime. I have an idealets start 
a whistling organization and send a 
delegation to Nezu York University 
where wc can serenade the dear pro
fessor in his off It curs, so that he 
will have more time to judge as to 
zi'hcther the sounds come from the 
nose, throat, or chest of the zuhistiers. 
Ill be out 'with membership blanks 
rer'fy' to have the whistlers sign on 
th dotted line
On October 6, 7 and 8, from 7 
p. m. to 10 p. m the formal 
registration of night students will 
take place. The Gymnasium build
ing will again be used to register 
the students as it proved very 
successful last year.
A student wishing to register 
will present his registration record 
to the head of his department, or 
the head of the department he 
wishes to schedule subjects, in the 
Gymnasium Building in order, to 
have the schedule arranged> and 
approved. : As soon as the regis
tration record has received the 
signature of a member-of the fac
ulty the student is in position to 
complete the registration in the 
registration room in the . Gymnsiura Building. Registration records 
which have not been approved by 
th faculty, or which do., nt have 
th signatures of members of the 
faculty will not be accepted at the 
registration room. Students .should 
be.,, careful of Jthis, feature, to see 
that their registration record is 
approved.
When the registration record is 
fully executed th student, should 
be' prepared to report to the cash
ier for payment of fees. The tui
tion fee is computed at the rate of 
$5 peryear for each weekly at
tendance hour, except for  certain 
subjectsthese are listed in the 
catalog of Night Courses. The 
minimum tuition fee is $30. In ad
dition to the tuition fee, each 
night student is required to pay a 
student activities fee of $1. Checks 
in payment of fees should be 
made payable to the Carnegie In
stitute of Technology.
Students who have completed 
courses and - -wish to take up1 other 
studies should, report to the divi
sions where the subjects arc 
scheduled and have their records 
approved. After approval the same 
routine will be followed in becom
ing registered.
Foresight
No doubt the depression will 
prevent a number of students 
from returning to register for an
other night term this fall. The 
unemployment situation will leave 
many, without the necessary funds. 
In another groupthere will be a 
tendency to hold back this year 
because of the uncertainty of their, 
jobs. A slight feeling of pcssl 
mism will enter into the situation.
This is, however, the wrong attitute to take. Depressions have 
come and gone, and the present 
one will do the same. Our chang
ing economic and industrial sys' 
terns have brought upon us r 
dilemma which is taking a great 
deal of far-sightedness, diplomacy 
and hard thinking to bring us 
again to prosperous and stabilized 
times.
When equilibrium is again reached the demand for men and wom
en with the. ability to see the 
new problems and to cope with 
them will be very large. Those 
people who are able to avail them
selves of the courses given in the 
night school will find themselves 
fortunate and well repaid in the 
end.
The promise of the future beck
ons us on. But only those who 
prepare beforehand will be in a 
position to' reap the  rewards re
sulting from higher education. A 
good moral isdont sit down and 
wait for something to happen. Go 
out and meet itdo your -best, to 
turn your unemployed time to 
such, account that the future .will 
find you ablv prepared.'

Co-Ed Smoking Stirs PADLOCKS TO BECollege Life on MidWest Campus PURCHASED
To smoke or not to smoke in 
the womens dormitories and 
sorority houses is the momentous 
question that is rocking some of 
o\ir best campuses.' And when a 
dean says NO and the fair co-eds 
say YES, then the smoke starts 
there is a saying something like 
this: Where theres smoke, theres 
fire."
This smoke question seems to 
be in for a real contest on the 
Northwestern University Campus, 
if we can believe a recent daily 
newspaper article. It is a burning 
question which is raging at the 
college. The dean of women says 
they shall not smoke in their 
houses because holes are burnt i: 
the beautiful furniture and the 
houses become full of smoke. 
Imagine a boy frierid going into a 
sorority house to sec one of the 
girls only to find that the house 
is full of smoke, and he is unable 
to find the person sought after. 
Why, my dear, lie would have to 
wear a' gas maskperfectly ab
surd. Furthermore, she goes on to 
say "it is very objectionable to 
the non-smoking members of the 
housethese people must be con
sidered.
But, the smoking culprits pout 
very sweetly and murmur: Oh, 
grandmother, what a big imagina
tion you have. Then the war 
go6s merrily on. The girls say 
YES, the dean says NO, and 
when women disagree, some man 
is sure to get it in the neck. It 
is always the innocent bystander, 
you know, who gets the blame. 
Somebody is sure to win the ar
gument, but you can bet your last 
night, shirt that it Avon't be the 
poor male of the species; he'll 
have to furnish the fags in cither 
case.
Our own campus as yet remains 
in a tranquil state but Who knows 
what storms arc brewing , in the 
cauldron and when the pot will 
boil oyer to engulf us in its smok
ing, burning contents. S.
FOR LOCKERS
/Arrangement Established Last 
Year to Be Employed
The new locker arrangement in
stituted last year is being con
tinued this year. In order to ob
tain a locker the following pro
cedure must be gone through:
The Institute will sell each stu
dent a patented combination pad-? 
lock for one dollar and upon pre
senting the card and padlock which 
is issued to the Locker Key Ro^m 
in the basement of Administration 
Hall, the student will be assigned 
a locker which is located as close 
as possible to his section. The 
padlocks will be sold at the book 
store in the basement of Admini: 
tration Hall. Lockers will not be 
assighed unless the student first 
purchases a padlock and obtains 
an assignment card. The forego
ing procedure applies to all new 
students and to those who did 
not purchase a padlock last year.
For those students who ; pur
chased a padlock last year it is 
only necessary to present the pad
lock with an assignment card at 
the Locker Key Room window 
when an assignment will be made 
without further charge.
Under no circumstances arc 
lockers to be taken by the night 
students before they have secured 
an assignment. Lockers will be 
emptied of their content.1? if it is 
found that the students have not 
secured assignments for them.
By all observing these rules re
garding the lockers 110 confusion 
will result from the arrangement 
and every one will be assured a 
locker who desires it.

Summer Daze
Tciiipus * Fugits' and so did the 
summer vacation. What did you do 
this .summer? Thats just what I 
did. Well my intentions were good 
anyway, even if they did go astray, 
so were your grandfather's. Its the 
depression, no it cant be, for the 
depression is over and the panic is 
oil. It was a tough summer folks, 
working steadily seven hours a day 
was a herculean task. A task that 
strained me, to the utmost. (Dont 
take this seriously people) this .task 
was rendered even more difficult 
when carried on in a country of 
strict prohibition, cigarette advertis
ing arid designing fctns, may the 
Lord bless em.
Fall Season Welcome
The fall season is indeed a wel
comed one for it ushers in the open 
season for hunters, legal and other
wise, social affairs, day and night 
school and . so many more shopping 
days before Xmas. It also sounds the 
death knell of vacation romances, for 
by this time the fools have either 
married or found some one else. 
Those boys ' and girls who cannot 
loaf comfortably at home have re
turned to'school for a course in be
ing nonchalant under any circum
stances including'being caught with 
a blond hair on ones coat when a 
red one should have been there.

year, so that we may print it in the Octobcr issue of the Carnegie 
Alumnus, in order that the alumni may know what Carnegie Tech Clan 
activities arc being arranged?
Send us news of your summer activities and y6ur plans for the 
fall and winter to the TARTAN. If there is to be a Carnegie Tech 
football game in your vicinity, you will probably want to plan a rally 
for that time, and the TARTAN is the best means of keeping your 
clan members informed of the organizations activities. News for the 
TARTAN should be sent Miss Andrews not later than Thursday of the 
week preceding the date of issue, which is Tuesday of each week during 
the college year.
The Carnegie Alumnus will go out in Octobcr, December, February, 
April, and June.
You might call to the attention of your clan members the impor
tance of paying their alumni dues promptly, to insure their receiving 
copies of the TARTAN and Alumnus. This year alumni literature 
will be sent to paid members only. Alumni dues arc $3.00 for the cur
rent year which runs from July to July, and $4.00 for delinquent dues, 
regardless of the number of years the alumnus may have allowed his 
dues to back-slidc.
The Fifth Annual Alumni Home-Coming is being planned for No
vember 6, 7, and 8. Reunion classes this year arc 1911, 1916, 1921,

return to the Campus at this time. We arc planning some new features 
for this years program.
Four new clans were organized during the past yearJohnstown, 
Akron, New York City, and Atlanta. This makes a total of twentythree groups of organized Carnegie Tech alumni throughout the country.
If you need a list of the alumni in your district, advise us of the 
towns included in your group and wc shall send it to you. Also, please

Considering the present flight 
from the gold~'siandanl one" must 
bear in mind the possibility that 
when European recovery docs 
come,1 many European nations 
may be using depreciated, fluctuat-, 
ing currency. How can we then 
induce th^nt toj^ljuy cur ;goods? 
Or, if we persist in high protec
tive tariffs, how: can we buy their 
goods, and scn'ifc them the gold 
that is necessary, to rehabilitate 
their currency?. In other words, 
if the gold standard falls in Eu
rope while we maintain the gold 
standard in this country there is 
grave danger that we may be on
lookers rather than participants in 
the next period of European pros
perity.
IMPROVEMENTS MADE

it will replace for social danccs. 
As soon as the eight-foot side
walk, winch will lead directly into 
this room from Woodlawn avenue, 
is completed,. there will be three 
convenient entrances, the other 
two including a hallway leading 
from the main gymnasium and a 
corridor connecting the third fioor 
of the building with this room. 
Contiguous to the new hall con-, 
vcnient check rooms and lava
tories have been constructed.
The new wing on the Collegeof Industries, which was under
taken last spring just before 
school left out, has been complet
ed and will provide valuable class
room and drawing room space. 
This wing, unlike the others of 
the College of Industries, con
tains three stories, .housing the 
Laboratory press of the l\inting 
department on the first flocir, of
fices of the department of Psy
chology on the second floor, and 
an excellently lighted drawing lab
oratory for the department .of. En
gineering Drawing and Des.crip-I 
tivc Drawing on the third floor.
A new quantitative chemistry 
laboratorjr, installed with modern 
equipment, was created  by feplitTlic, depreciation in the pound 
sterling from $4.85 to $3.83 is in 
effect a twenty-five per cent tariff 
on -/American goods entering 'Great 
Britain except of coursc for the 
fact; that tkc government does not 
collect a traiff duty. However the 
Bri'tislVcustomer must pay a twentyfiv.e .pcr. cent premium on such pur.cKases in the guise of an increased 
price of the dollar if he, continues 
to buy our products. Many Amer
ican products formerly within the 
purchasing power of the English 
.will . now be beyond their reach. 
They will substitute domestic prod
ucts ' or turn to foreign producers 
whoarc selling in cheaper currcncics.
.T.h.c.magnitude of American trade 
Avhi^Ji will be affected by this drop 
in the pouiid is shown in a com
pilation of figures. on British im
ports from the United States, quoted 
in iviilliohs of dollars and beginning 
with 1923: 881, 985, 1,936, 977, 848, 
8572, 871, and 682. For the first half 
of tlic present year the figure is 228 
indicating a total of 456 for the 
whole year under conditions similar 
.to"those prevailing during the first 
six.: months, but recent events leave 
pur future  export trade to Great 
' Britain, serio.usly threatened.
As though this were not enough 
bad lidivV \vc' now find the Scan
dinavian countries abandoning the 
gold standard which means that 
tHeir currencies will depreciate in 
comparison with the money of those 
countries retaining the gold stan
dard and that purchases of Amer
ican and French products by these 
populations will also decline. They 
will turn from our export products 
to other quarters where their de
preciated currency will have great
er purchasing power.
So,'*to the extent that we are de
spondent upon an increase in Euro
pean purchasing power for recovery, 
if is useless to look for a business, 
revival in the immediate '/future. 
Ii]dcdt i.f Europe does recover, no 
assur'uhcB. that it will bring the 
mu'cli "hoped for boom in the man
ner of pre-war days. when all the; 
leading nations were on a gold 
basis. It . is the hope of English 
statesmen and business interests 
that the government will be able 
to reduce the national expenditures 
sufficiently to balance the budget 
and the poiind will depreciate suffi
ciently to allow British-goods to 
undersell American and French 
goods oiv the world market. This 
will bring orders to Great Britain,. 
accelcrate: manufacture and absorb 
the unemployed.
. *i'f it works put. in this fashion, 
it will, of . course,- spell business re
vival forGreat Britain, but since 
f.Kcir revival is to come by way of 
underselling.,us in the world market

Golf For Carnegie?
Shall Carnegie formulate, a team with which to enter the. new and fast growing branch of intercollegiate  sports 
known as golf? And if it might decide.to form such a team 
will a good course be secure^,for play, and,'will a coach be 
hired for instruction?1 /.These two questions are becoming of increasing interest tp:- the,> student body since the outcropping of rumors last 
semester foretelling the possibility' of a golf team being 
established at Carnegie.
t . A ,number of neighboring, colleges .including both Ducjuesne and Pitt have recently seen lit to introduce golf and h,ave.in most cases secured pros and arranged schedules 
for 'meets in the spring! Also at' the majority of the: eastern colleges arid at such .schools as l^eiin State, Detroit University, and Notre Dame, golf, has beena recognized sport 
for quite a few years. It.Vis,just since' this portion of the 
tri-state district has begun to adBpt golf that the problem 
has very definitely come to the fore'at Carnegie.
. Concerning the physical advisability of minor sports such...as golf, Florence Fisher Parry, widely-read columnist 
in aPittsburgh paper has published the following opinions:
There are so many sports the social advantages of 
are recognized assets..to.,a man's worldly success; and 
it, seems to me that they shoul'd' 'bef featured with more enthusiasm in college, athletics. Football, crew and track 
make heroes on the campus, but can not be called to prac
tical account once their .pamcipktoi's are flung out into the 
world. Whereas' the very sports'designed to afford a man continual recreation for a lifetime are given slight place in 
the college athletic program.
I refer to golf, tennis, horseback riding, sailing, skat
ing, swimming. These six'accomplishments contribute more to the general health and liappines's of man than all the 
featured college sports puttogether.
The average, business man doesnt have a cinder track, a Forbes Field or a backyard, river.op hand after office 
hours to, be athletic, in. -But the. chances are that theresa 
pool.handy to swim in,.a {tennis court near by, a bridle path 
across yon field, a golf course. at a ^stones throw. Moreover, companions at-any. of these' sports .are there to call
..upon.-" The social order-may be-served as well .as. the endsof health. .
If I were a..young mjui, .th<ise, daysj determined^ to get life by the ,tail, Id. choose my sports with a long eye to the 
future.., Proceeding on .the. pjpmiser;that iife Vvas going to 
serve pie well, an^ giy.e me. j.ts^.bftst prizes, Id prepare for SUCCESSand. success, presupposes'leisure.
. . Very well, then, Id get ready for that leisure my suc
cess was to'reward me with.' i4d'learn to do the things 
that my success was going toprovide for my children, so that I could be a fair example and teacher to them. Id 
learn to swim the RIGHT way, the best way, the most graceful. Id learn  to ride, and sail a boat, and box, and play some tennis.
Id learn to play golf properly, and a stiff game of 
bridge.; And thus equipped, I.d know that I was an asset , to the social structure, primed for its benefits, ready for its favors.
Speed the day when, college athletics will/ be more 
wisely distributed and their choice not confined to a few sports impractical for middle life.' Gre'it sums are spent by 
our universities for coaches and trainers, but what, pray, for pros and riding; swimming, tenriis} boxing masters?
What are coll,eges for? To make its students citizens? Factors in their-community? .Then let their athletic course 
be designed to educate them what -to do with their aftercollege leisure, too;:iwhat healthy and .intelligent ..recreation to put their talents to, long after the echoes of the cheerleaders have faded away.
Airs. Parry has indeed presented the situation in' a force
ful manner. Of special benefit was the furnishing of a vital 
thought to. the college student who in his preparation for future life is so concerned about, scholastic endeavors that 
he Jails, to .realize .the .necessity for developing at the same time his personality and social accomplishments. .
Garpegie might well take the necessary steps and estab
lish golf on the proper scale. An ideal arrangement would 
include both in intermurarcompefition to build up material  
and to permit participation of the greatest numbers, and then an entrant into the intercollegiate competition to further stimulate the sport, ff* I * p * ' ./*, < *
The Tartan is quite anxious to publish opinions of an editorial vein of persons other than merely those directly 
connected with, its staff. Any contributions, of reasonable 
length and accompanied; by' .tlie; writers signature will be considered for publication. .V * * '' *
The corrected-.version ol the new Skibo Song appears on this page. This ':nW school song, is quite acceptable 
on the basis of originality and th^e spirit of its music. A 
campaign on the part of the band,-the glee clubs, and the leaders of the student assemblies to have this song more widely used is quite necessary.

FROM THE FENCE
Successor to Union
At last we have a school ballroom where there is 
room enough to swing a cat. The new addition 
over the pool in the gym with its large floor space, 
high ceiling, and accompanying lounge room and 
check room will 
supply a long felt 
need. Even a bit 
of modern design 
w a s incorporated 
in the design of 
the room. The 
only drawback is 
the unfinished ap
pearance of the 
I ceiling, but that may be rectified in time. Runior
has it that there will be a contest for the official
name of the addition so there may be a chance for 
someone to make a little cigarette money.* * * *
Those Old Meanies, the Cops
Our brave minions .of the law displayed commend
able heroism in attempting to disperse one of Carne
gieTechs notorious Pajama Parades. The officers 
always show great courage when assailing unarmed
and frightened students on an innocent celebration
but arc noAvhere to be found, or stand idly by when 
a real menace such as election riots, gang shootings, 
or, spfiaUcasys are concerned. The parade was much 
tamer than usual as Forbes Street traffic was barely 
disturbed. The only important drawback-to the whole 
affair was that the Sophs had to resort to dipping 
the P)cl)ps in the sheep trough in frdn't of the Library 
instead of in the big fountain. A.rthc task was com
pleted the disappointed officers threw a few tear gas 
bombs to make things look bad. An upperclassman, 
watching' the parade, was grabbed by two policemen 
and pushed toward the wagon. He protested, "You 
cant do this! Cant we? says the cops, and in lie 
went. Moral: Right or wrong the cop is always
right.* * * *
Dorm Doins
The mens dorms were enshrouded in gloom fot' a 
few evenings until the demand for light bulbs was

from three accordians and a trumpet all going on dif

Ha! Foiled!
Several hardboilcd Sophs received a rude jolt one 
sunny noontide when Igor Karrassik, disguised as 
a humble .Plebe, eased by and allowed himself to be 
sucked in. The regulation sharks discovered scads of 
ruics lie had broken and were on the verge of hurry
ing the luckless Plebe off to the torture chamber
when they discovered he was only a mere Senior. 
Were they chagrined!? ... By the way, Edna Pearson 
would like it distinctly understood that she is a fullllegcd Junior and not the Freshman that so many 
have taken her for.* * * *
Heres Something!
In our midst is a Russian immigrant who, altlio 
lie has worked his way, puts ua*all to shame with his 
record, PI. G. Landau, now a Math Senior, has an 
average of over 5,5 for three years here by making 
8 Cs, 19 Bs, and 31 As. To boot, lie took first place 
in the state in the Culture test of. the Carnegie 
Foundation exams of a year and a half ago. Asked 
how lie had amassed such a comprehensive knowl
edge on cultural subjects he replied that, his source 
was the New York Sunday Times which lie reads 
from cover to cover . . . On this side we have Rose
mary Lynch, a transfer from Scton Hill, who made 
all As last semester . . . Our hats off to them! Most 
of us feel lucky if we get our necessary 144 PQs.Hi # Hi *
What Next?
There arc rumors of a mysterious cult about to 
spring up on the campus. Some sort of a Bachelors 
Club (Girls Beware!) Everything is stilt quite un
decided but if it develops it will be patterned after a
similar organization on a western campus where the
members cant date 
any single girl 
more than once a 
semester, have 
Dutch Treat dates, 
and iii general 
take every meas
ure to avoid being 
entangled in any 
one f e m a 1 e  s 
snares. Very dire 
punishment follows an infraction of the rules. The 
members wear sweaters which have the Clubs' Seal 
over the wearers heart. The Seal consists of a black 
circle on which is the word NO and a hand in the 
gesture "thumbs down." Some idea if it works. Won
der what the girls reaction will be?
Hi oc b b
Boo! the Jinx Again!
Last Saturday Ye Olde W. & J. Jinx reared its 
head again and another notch against Carnegie Tech 
was carved on the President's cane. It seems that 
Carnegie has to' produce championship teams to beat 
the jinx that even went so far as to cause a grand
stand collapse at the last Tcch-W. & J. game in 
Washington. Not being bothered with traditional
hoodoos connected with our next foes we should
make a fine showing against them in spite of the 
YV. & J. upset . . . The first football dance of the 
season provided a debut for many of the new Fresh
man girls, a number of which lookwell, promising. 
A number of the ,old guard were on hand among whom 
were Artz-Hudson, Sturgis-Todd, I-Iipplc-Sabol, LongMcBride, Warden-Madsen, Wirsing-Nagle, BouchcrleB'eckcrt, Palcn-Ritchcy, McKcon-Morris, and cx-Techs 
McClelland and Puruckcr. Morgan, McGcorgc and.

CHEERIO!
speak to Student Council at its 
next meeting in regard to the Wel
fare Drive. ,
Because the senior representative 
from Margaret Morrison and _ the 
president of the Margaret Morrison 
Senate is the same person, it was 
decided that another senior be 
elected to fill the vacancy thus 
caused. The election will be held 
as soon as possible.
SERIOUSLY SPEAKING
(Continued fromPage One) 
ness. The paradox of the ages 
superabundance of technical tal
ent, engineering skill, and a mis
erable lack of political honesty 
and competence1; a plethora of 
oods and a harvest of distress; 
leashed powers of nature and un
balanced national and racial ha
treds; magnificent adaptationto 
the forces of nature but a thor
oughly demoralized understanding 
of human nature.
The task before tis now is not 
the taming of -the land but the 
awakening of an interest and pas
sion for the regulation and order
ing-of o,ur. society so that -poverty, 
war,' class struggles, unemploy
ment aiid the -rest of the dark 
brood, may . b.e , eliminated. This 
requires the summing up of.atti
tudes and urges' of a different or
der from those which actuated 
and impelled our sires. Socialized 
thinking, common action, ;co,-oper
ative and purposeful planning, the
elimination of the ethics of jungle 
competition and individualism run 
rampant and parasiticthese are 
the call of the moment. We need 
social engineering, economic en
lightenment and bold yenturesomenesseven U,topian scheming 
to restore the balance. A stress 
toward the redressing, of vested 
and swolleninterests, a breaking 
thought of the bonds , of stupid 
and -ignorant .mediocrity in high 
officesthis offers a challenge to 
students in' college today.
Mere muddleheadedness, indo
lence, or indifference will no long
er dothat way lies disaster and 
collapse. Graves in battlefields 
aiid paupers fields will end ca
reers of this type in the future.
If the appeal can be made and 
heard to our generation, the re
sponse will be forthcoming and 
the remedy provided for this 
grievious debacle we arc sliding 
into. Youth holds a promise 
which'must not be killed as it has 
Jbeeii over and over in' times past 
as the old men warped youn'g men 
Lto their moribund needs.
Nathan Miller.
_ The first assembly of the year is being held in the 
Union at noon today. Freshmen must attend and upperclassmen will find it of interest to do so. The popular speakers, 
musical programs, and entertainment presented make these monthly meetings quite worth while.
Song In Handbook
Contains Errors
There are several errors in the 
Skibo Song as printed in the Fresh
man Handbook. The complete song 
should read as follows:
College days, college-days,
Days of work and play and 
friends galore;
Friendships new, comrades true, 
Tics will endure for evermore.
Chorus
Wherever we go, whatever we do, 
Well always have a thought for you, 
"" Skibo, Skibo; ^
The days .we spent at C: I. T.
.Will ever in our memory be,
Skibo, Skibo;
(And when we go to face the world, 
And start on our careers,
Our ears will still be ringing 
With the good old Tartan cheers, 
With the C-A-R-N-E-G-I-E Tech!

ROBBERIES HIT
FOUR FRATERNITIES
(Continued from Page One) 
Again the second floor was the 
only floor disturbed. The fellows 
rooming on that floor reported 
losses totaling about one hundred 
dollars. Clothing and jewelry were 
left undisturbed.
The burglar-alarm system at the 
Kappa Delta Rlio house proved to 
be of no value Thursday'morning 
for an entrance was made and 
fifteen dollars was taken.
The series of robberies evidently 
stopped, or started, at the Sigma 
Phi Epsilon house, for Sigma Nu 
and Sigma Alpha Epsilon reported 
no losses.
Police arc working on the case 
but they have little hopes as nobodysaw or heard the intruder.

planned with tlie purpose of giving 
students an hour in which to enjoy 
fellowship and express devotion. 
The meetings" are interesting, the 
talks short, and refreshments are 
served. Aside from the Sunday 
evening meeting social events, such 
as bowling, swimming, skating and 
hiking, which add interest to the 
student life, arc held during the 
year. Plan to be on hand and to 
join this student organization.
Two other events to be held in 
the near future will include a din
ner for out-of-town Presbyterian 
Students on October 13 and a re
ception, by the Oakland Methodist

This is not the first instance in 
which the caliber of the work done 
at Tech has been recognized by the 
government. ^'Last session four 
naval officers studied advanced 
metallurgy and were awarded M.S. 
degrees at commencement. Prior 
to that several members of the ser
vice had been assigned to Tech for 
study.
