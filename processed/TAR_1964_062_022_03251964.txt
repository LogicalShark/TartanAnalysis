Spring Carnival Plans To Be 
jy Bigger And Better Than Ever
Notice: Moved to New Location. Bigger and Better Than 
Ever . . . Expanding our facilities, in order to serve you, the 
students of Carnegie Tech, better.
With this bit of fanfare, the Spring Carnival Committee 
of 1964 formally announces that the participants and other

Liberal Arts 
Requirements
A change has been made in the 
Humanities and Social Science 
program for Engineering & Sci
ence and Margaret Morrison stu
dents in order to provide "A high
er education in liberal arts. Fun
damentally, the change involves a 
revision of required subjects for 
freshmen and sophomores, and 
the introduction of a depth ser
ies and distribution subject5 for 
E & S juniors and seniors.
The present MMCC and E & S 
freshmen will continue in this re
vised program. Most of these stu
dents have completed the shorten
ed one-semester requirement of 
English Composition, are complet
ing the requirement of Western 
Civilization, and are taking the 
one required semester of Introduc
tion to Literature. Next year's en
tering freshmen wiil take the same 
required courses. Some fraction of 
the students, however, will be re 
quired to take two semesters of 
I English Composition to raise them 
to the required level of compet
ence.
Under the revised program, 
there will be one semester courses 
in psychology and economics, re
quired by all sophomores. The 
previous economics requirement 
v/as two semesters.
As in the old program, ten full 
courses in liberal arts will be re
quired by all E & S students. But 
in order to give the E & S students 
the best liberal arts education, a

depth sequence and a one

j All May Have 
>New Catalogue
| The Catalogue Committee, j which makes recommendations 
j and supervises the publication of 
j university catalogues, has changed 
jj the policy of distribution of cata| logue supplements for the coming 
j year. These supplements provide 
j information on the curriculum of I each department and major field, 
j Until this time, the policy had 
v^been to distribute no individual 
1 copies to students. Supplements 
I were made available to students

I to secure a copy for his own peri sonal use.
campus this year. Instead of hav
ing to go to plank jousting be
hind Morewood, buggy races in 
Schenley, egg toss on the Cut, 
and the Midway on the parking 
lot, activity will be confined to 
two places. Buggy races will still 
be held in Schenley Park, but 
the Midway, along with all the 
other events, has been moved 
to the field behind Morewood 
Gardens.
The Carnival Committee has 
decided to entertain approximate
ly 150 orphans from the Pitts
burgh area. These children will 
use the facilities of the Midway 
at hours when business would 
otherwise be slow, and the fra
ternities and sororities have vol
unteered to take the loss for all 
the games and rides which the 
orphans use. The responsibility 
for the childrens transportation 
and safety will be handled by the 
Kiwanis Club of Pittsburgh.
A ferris wheel, and possibly 
other rides, will be added to this 
years Carnival. The owners of 
the ferris wheel will run their 
operation separate from the Car
nival Committee, but the Com
mittee has agreed to pay for 
electric power.
Plank jousting will again be 
held behind Morewood, in the 
mudhole. This time the event will 
be run, hopefully, on a more com
petitive level  that is, some of 
the rowdiness will be excluded, 
but none of the good, clean (?) 
fun. Anyone interested in enter
ing a five-man team please con

Announcement of enter

the groups will be installed in 
the Skibo snack bar juke box. *

Slack Presents 
Dark Comedies 
Of Shakespeare
Dr. Robert C. Slack will lecture 
on The Dark Comedies of Wil
liam Shakespeare on April 7, 11:30 
a.m. in the Fine Arts Theater.
The dark comedies include All's 
Well That Ends Well, Measure for 
Measure, and Troileus and Cressida. The plays were written in 
the same period as Hamlett Othel
lo, and King Lear, immediately 
after the death of Shakespeares 
young son, Hamlet, and were in
fluenced by the tragic mood of the 
latter plays. However, because the 
plays do not end tragically, they 
are considered comedies.
Dr. Slack will place emphasis 
on Troileus and Cressida, which 
was the feature play last year in 
Stratford, Ontario.
Dr. Slack is Head of the De
partment of Humanities in Mar
garet Morrison and Associate Pro
fessor of English and Humanities. 
As the Director of the Curriculum 
Study Center, he helped ,to de
velop the' Pittsburgh area Ad
vanced Placement English. Pro
gram, and served as a consultant 
in this program from 1959 to 1962.
How Do You 
Spend 40* ? 
Read Patterns
The ways of spending forty cents 
indeed are very many:
An octal group of Snickers bars 
accounts for every penny;
And forty one-cent pretzels will 
as neatly do the trick;
As will a grilled cheese sandwich 
with a crunchy pickle stick.
A box or two (on sale) you get 
of Scottie wet strength tissue 
But NONE of these can match 
the coming Patterns April issue. 
What is this Patterns? You may 
ask  and Well  whove never 
bought it,
A dress design, a Chinese food  
perhaps that's what youve 
thought it?
Ah, no, my poor misguided friends, 
allow me to constru:
Techs Patterns* pages printed lie 
Tech-witty, artful, pensive;
A noble use of printer's ink, and 
oh, so inexpensive!
Oh, yeah, you say, thats great." 
But still, youd rather have a 
sandwich.
Nourish your stomach, not your 
school, a motto with one grand 
hitch:
For, years from now youll look 
on Tech in quite a different way 
Youll wish to see old friends 
again, and hear what they may 
say.
Youll rack your brain and close 
your eyes but still will not re
member,
Youll wish so hard you'd listened

EatPark
If you have been wishing for 
the good old days when you were 
in high school; when every week 
vou went steady with a different 
boy; when everyone got excited 
about football and basketball; and 
when you hardly ever had to 
crack a book, well, then, welcome 
to Eat n Park. Where else can 
you see 50 policemen in a 2x4 
parking lot, or charming sophisbrooding, the Foxes will be glad 
to see you, Heaven knows they 
dont need any more noise.
The Riverboat Room
In the Penn-Sheraton Hotel, the 
Riverboat Room is as exact a 
replica of a steamboat from the 
1800s as possible. The red velvet 
walls, elaborate chandeliers, plush 
chairs, and costumed waitresses 
contribute to an atmosphere per
fectly accented by a captains

ers of all shapes and sizes, and of
course the specialty  a Big-Boy 
(where else would they think of 
putting tartar sauce on a ham
burger?) can be obtained with a
r minimum of waiting time. Pas
tries and ice cream dishes are also 
available for those with a sweet 
tooth. Of course, prices are very 
low so it. cant possibly hurt the 
pocketbook, but .youll probably 
need the money youve, saved for 
a bodyguard. Why not borrow one 
of the Tech security guards? I'm 
sure theyll be willing to moonlight a little.
i The Foxes
 One Door and several atmos
pheres from the Gazebo in Shadyside nestles the Foxes; although 
the two are owned by the same 
entrepreneur, they are at opposite 
ends of the social scale: The Foxes 
is much more vertical than hori
zontal; each booth seems to be on 
a different level with a wild and 
uncontrolled combo on a level about three feet above your head 
al the back. I wouldnt go there if: 
you are very much in love with 
your date; you want to eat (at 
all); you dont have a strong 
stomach, good lungs, and an ID card; you like any conversation, 
or if you dont like loud (not 
necessarily good) jazz. Someone 
said that if TGIF were intensified 
10 times, crammed into about 
the space it normally occupies, 
all the dances were about twice as 
good, and with Vi the light, that 
would be the general idea of the 
Foxes.
Strangely enough, the place has 
a wierd charm. It makes one feel

excellent. Specialties are seafood 
and steaks, with dinners at about^ 
$7. Late suppers (the lights are

keep it something of a secret; it 
has neither Le Monts ostentation 
nor its advertising campaign.

Sigma Kappa & Kappa Sigma 
Bring Easter To Tech Campus
Easter came early to the Tech campus this year. Sigma 
Kappa and Kappa Sigma held an Easter party on March 21 
for the children of the faculty. All morning the two groups 
were busy coloring Easter eggs, filling baskets, making bun
nies, and hiding the eggs.
After the children arrived, it didnt take them long to find the 
eggs and bunnies. In fact, it took 
th Sig Kaps and Kappa Sigs 
longer to hide them! Now the 
children can look forward to get 
ting another Easter basket in a 
week.
Easter baskets were also placed 
in the fraternity house and on the 
desk in Morewood Lobby.

Are There No 
Ugly Men?
Editor, The Tartan:
Surely the handsome brutes 
can search their organizations 
and find a candidate for the an
nual Ugliest Man on Campus 
contest. UMOC, sponsored by 
Kappa Chapter of Alpha Phi 
Omega, welcomes anyone to par
ticipate in this ugliest UMOC 
ever. To preserve competition, 
faculty members are ineligible.
The opportunity to stuff the 
ballot box will be from 8:30 to 
4:30 in front of Skibo and the 
Hunt Library, Monday through 
Thursday, April 27-30. Voting 
is definitely unlimited, but a 
penny per ballot. All proceeds 
go to Campus Chest.
In order to simplify the pro
cedure and give every organiza
tion an equal opportunity to en
ter, Alpha Phi Omega has ar
ranged to have the ugly pic
tures taken on April 4, at a 
nominal fee payable then.
It is not wise for an organi
zation to hide its ugly candi
date. It should let everyone suf
fer. UMOC is an excellent 
chance topublicize an organiza
tion. UMOC is a lot of fun and 
will give the fellows a reason 
to work together to advertise 
and support their ugly man. 
Pictures and names of candi

receive public recognition and

Carnival dance. It is as ugly as 
the winner himself (if this is

ugly for the rest of the year. 
The fun and enjoyment of

Avoids Issue
Ltian
In Congress
by Tim Hiss
Last Wednesday the committee chairmen of Student 
Congress gathered to discuss plans for the forthcoming 
Congress elections. This year Congress has decided to put 
forth a special effort, greater than ever in the past, to attract 
qualified students to its April 21 elections.
Encouraging news poured in from all over Campus. In 
keeping with its general motto for this year of progress, 
Student Congress has gone to the administration to talk 
over campus problems and has found the administration 
willing both to listen and to act.
The school_has placed fences around the lawns on the 
premise that the campus looks better when the grass does 
not have any paths worn through it. It is unfortunate that 
this had to be done, but alternatives are available. If the 
fences are removed and the paths reappear, the same 
aromatic fertilizer that was used last year could be used 
again as a subtle deterrent.
One sad note prevailed this week. Once again the archi
tecture. department has failed to produce the design of a 
bulletin board for the campus which it has promised for so 
long. Congress will be glad to accept student plans for the 
Ibulletin board, which is to be compatible with the design 
|of the rest of the campus and placed in a prominent locaItion.

The Carnegie Plan
Editor, Th Tartan:
We feel that Mr. Strafs edi
torial of March 18 has avoided 
the basic issue of the parking 
situation. The issue is that we 
object to being railroaded into 
using the school operated lots. 
The problem is not who should 
issue tickets, as Mr. Straf sug
gests, but whether they should 
be issued. The recent restric
tions of previously legal parking 
\areas and the over-zealous en
forcement of these restrictions 
appears to us to be a none too 
subtle effort to force the use of 
the metered lots. It is difficult 
to understand how the students 
here at Carnegie Tech can so 
passively accept such action.

TARTAN
Whait is the Carnegie Plan? Many would answer 
Screw the students. Is this really correct? The adminis
tration chooses the subject matter which must be mastered 
before a student may graduate. As a result a student is 
likely to take several courses that he does not like, and 
others that he does not feel are relevant. If a student wants 
to take only subjects he likes, he should not have come 
here. Where requests for changes are reasonable, they have 
been considered; but the administration expects the student 
to perform in more than his own field. This is a suitable 
goal for a school whose purpose is to turn out graduates 
of above average capabilities and knowledge.
Then, perhaps the trouble arises in the area of studentteacher relations: Publish or perish is the maxim, and 
often teachers spend as little time as possible on their teach
ing duties. But the standards are high, so the student must 
do much self-teaching. This doesnt sound bad; however 
even more could be learned and higher standards attained 
if teachers would teach. This is a reasonable request. The 
administration could aid such a development by putting 
more emphasis on teaching.
Often the complaint is that too many students are 
flunked or given low grades. Standards, are inflexible and 
do not make allowance for human differences (so the com
plaint goes). Where the majority of a class flunks, this is 
probably an unjust state of affairs  if students did not 
have the ability to pass, they would not be admitted, and it 
is hard to believe that the majority of a class is loafing. The 
same reasoning does not hold when a sizable minority 
flunks. More often than not those who flunk havent learn
ed. If teachers pass them, they are helping students who 
didnt work at the expense of those who did (lowered stand
ards, prestige, etc.). While inflexible standards may be un
fair, perfectly flexible ones are also.
The above paragraphs have been mostly a defense of 
the present system (with a few improvements added.) The 
most important effect of such r.ules and standards has not 
yet been mentioned: The atmosphere which results. Car
negie Tech is not the mainstream of the American college 
culture. For better or for worse it is much more serious, and 
has more work-oriented students. Criticisms of the second 
point are often heard : and where work means devotion 
to studies only, the attitude may be a narrow (and un
desirable) one. Tech offers working -students a wide var
iety of activities; they need not be confined to any one area. 
Such work is part of the process of getting an education. 
(But didnt you write before that studies are much more 
important? Answer: Yes, where there is a conflict. I dont 
think student bodies should guide anyone into any acti
vity.)
This article has been a bunch of generalities with the 
faults that such sweeping statements have. The author has 
tried to give credit where credit is due.

Freshman Penalized 
| For Possession Of Car
| To better acquaint Carnegie Tech students with the operI stions of the Student Court and to familiarize them with 
Jfcschool laws, the Tartan will publish a series of Student Court 
| eases. (The actual cases outlined are true and factual. All 
| names have been withheld to ensure the anomymity of those
|j involved.)Ed. ?----------------------------------------------------
jf The first of these cases involves 
$ the possession of an automobile 
by a male freshman dormitory 
h resident. It reads:
jj The Student Court took action 
\-against an underclass student who 
I'idimtted to operating and pos| sessing a car. CIT rules prohibit 
j resident freshman and sopho| jnores from operating or pos] sessing automobiles.
In this case the Student Court 
 handed down the following de
ll cisin:
| I. He shall immediately corn
il ply with the school policy,
^ and continue to do so for the
^ remainder of the year.
i 2. He shall not possess or oper' ate a motor vehicle during
| the next school year in spite
 of the fact that he will then
\ be a third-year student and
| hence normally be entitled to
:j possess an automobile. That
j is, he shall continue to comply with the policy pertainW ing to freshmen and sophoi mores during 1964 and 1965.
: 3. He shall pay the four parkjj ing fines he has accrued by
April 1, 1964.
I 4. He is hereby placed on a
J special probation which subj jects him to severe discipline
J ary action if he fails to comj ply with any of t h e above
j provisions.
One reason for the severity of 
| this punishment was the fact that 
3 the student had acquired four 
:) parking tickets. Furthermore, the 
^ student had his roommate pur| chase the registration forms from j the school for the automobile. His 
I roomate, a graduate student, was 
j entitled to purchase such forms.

Security lacks the full under
standing you if eel you have.
In familiarizing your readers 
with parking regulations, you 
rely on traditions Pittsburgh po
lice feel are no longer adequate 
to meet current needs. The 
usual penalties and only oc
casional use of towing were by
passed as methods for punishing 
abuse of traffic regulations as a 
result of a recent Pittsburgh 
Safety Council extensive survey 
of traffic situations on the Car
negie campus. The report rec
ommended that all parking be 
eliminated on the Frew Street 
corner, and from Forbes Avenue 
to Tech Street along Margaret 
Morrison Street, as well as by 
fireplugs, not now properly re
spected. As a result of this study, 
and modifying recommendations 
by Mr. Young that parking be 
permitted on one side of the 
Frew Street corner an d from 
Forbes up to the Home Man
agement House (beside Donner) 
along Margaret Morrison; city 
police initiated a strict removal 
of cars when tickets were no 
longer effective.
Their study concentrated on 
student safety at the blind cor
ners Tech students do not prop
erty respect, and their renewal 
of the fire plug ordanance only 
strengthens necessary fire pro
tection. Since Tech police have
no authority on Pittsburgh 
streets other than in' emergency, 
Pittsburgh Police aire solely re
sponsible. They will enforce 
these' new regulations, either on 
their own initiative or when 
campus need, as registered with 
the city, necessitates. Their in
tent is not to force use of the 
metered lots.
Reconsider also your general 
attack on Tech Security wnich, 
perhaps because - of ignorance, 
disregards their service to Tech 
and its students. They have co
operated extensively in Fall. Fes

their emergency procedures dur-.

of great assistance to at least

r*et 6 - CARNEGIE TARTAN  Wednesday, March 25, 1961
On Thursday, April 2, the Film Arts Society will hold the 
premiere of a new short film, Evolution of a Shadow. Filmed 
here on the Tech campus, it was produced and directed by 
Ken Johnson.
Ken is a Senior in the Drama Department, and has been 
the President and Business Man-*' 
ager for Film Arts since 1960.
Quizzed at a rehearsal for Scotch 
and Soda, which he is currently 
directing, Ken said that the film 
is about a young girl who lets 
her fear take possession of her.
My purpose in making the pic-, 
ture was to gain an understand
ing of the techniques and prob
lems inherent in film work; this 
aspect of directing is missing from 
our training in the Drama Depart
ment, he added.
 Sam Goldwyn, Jr., who recently 
visited the campus, expressed an 
enthusiastic desire to see Kens 
film, although it had. not been 
compiled then. Goldwyn hopes to 
be able to assist him in his ca
reer as a motion picture director.
The film will be shown at Film 
Arts, after the Easter recess, on 
the same program with Bitter 
Rice. Film Arts showings are in 
Porter Hall 100 at 4;30, 7:00, and 
9:30.
lake most of us, you probably 
feel pressured at times with the 
demands made on you for original 
thinking,  for fresh ideas that 
will lift your work above the

of this book, Science and Health 
with Key to the Scriptures by 
Mary Baker Eddy, we are learn
ing how to turn to God for the

ciate, Karl Brunner, of UCLA, 
to continue work pi'eviously sup
ported by GSIA.
The grant, which will be used 
over a three-year period, will en

summer months, Dr. Meltzer will 
concentrate on what economic 
factors lead to unemployment

Fine Arts 
Invites 
Pre-Collegians
The Pre-College Programs of 
the College of Fine Arts offer 
Tour-fold benefits to its partici
pants: They provide a sound
background to the arts for high 
school students. Students receive 
professional guidance from ex
perienced educators. Assistance is 
offered to help the student dis
cover if he has the necesary apti
tudes for further study at the col
lege level. Finally, the college has 
the opportunity of appraising the 
student.
Although these courses do not 
earn college credit for the par
ticipant, a written evaluation of 
his work is presented to him at 
the close of the sessions.
Courses are being offered this 
year in architecture, art, drama, 
and music. Classes will begin on 
June 22 and continue through 
July 31, and will be included in 
a five-day week.
Application forms and instruc
tions may be obtained by writing 
to: Professor Kenneth Burchard, 
Director of Summer Sessions, Car
negie Tech, Pittsburgh 13, Penn

-JCameron Choir Gains 
Performance Spotlight
Carnegie Tech alumni who 
come back looking for the Men 
or Womens Glee Clubs will find 
their counterparts in the Cam
eron Choir. The choir, formed 12 
years ago, is made up approxi
mately 60 male and female sing
ers. All of the departments at 
Carnegie Tech arc represented 
in the choir. Mr. Camp, the di
rector, holds auditions at the be
ginning of each semester.
The versatile gioup is equally 
at home singing Bach and Brahms 
motets, contatas, Walt Whitmans 
poems in Lincoln lyrics and 
Strauss love songs. They also sing 
spirituals, show tunes from such 
productions as Porky and Bess, 
Scottish airs and campus songs. 
When performing for Carnegie 
Tech alumni, the. choir includes 
a sing-a-long session of campus 
songs, usually reserved for the 
end of the program 
The busy stuaenu give two 
formal concerts a year, usually at 
the end of each semester. They 
also give three or four concerts 
year at various high schools.
The choir sometimes hits the 
I road for alumni concerts. They 
have performed in New Yoifc 
City, Columbus, Erie and Phila,
| delphia and on April 19 will b|s 
, in Baltimore. The choir has alsa^ 
performed on radio and televi
sion. Locally, the Camerons have 
performed in Carhegie Music Hall 
and Stephen Foster Memorial.
The traveling' uniforms cull 
for the wearing of the Cameron 
plaid spirts, white blouses and 
plaid sashes from the left shoulder 
to the right hip for the girls; the 
men wear dark trousers, CamI 
eron blazers, white shirts and bo\^ 
ties.
In April 4, The Womens Clan 
will sponsor the Annual Thistle 
Scholarship Bridge Luncheon. The 
Cameron Choir is featured on Ihe 
program. It will present a pro
gram of light music, including

THE BELL TELEPHONE COMPANIES 
SALUTE: REGIS FILTZ
As an engineering associate, Regis Filtz (B.S.M.E., 1958) 
is involved in virtually all facets of telephone communica
tions for Bell of Pennsylvania. From the design of under
ground conduit to bridge cables, Regis is an expert.
Much of his reputation caime about on his first assignmenl, where his recommendations for the most economical 
underground cable resulted in savings estimated at $200,000 
annually.
Other assignments have included engineering require
ments on a variety of communications equipment and
services. He has even taught a course m switching logic.
For Regis, the diversity of assignments has broadened 
his engineering knowledge and given him the opportunity 
to advance in position and compensation. His authority 
in catenary suspensions requires field engineers to consult 
with him in the design of such spans.
Regis Filtz, like many young engineers, is impatient 
to make things happen for his company and himself. There 
are few places where such restlessness is more welcomed 
or rewarded than in the fast-growing telephone business.

Intramural Night
A large, enthusiastic crowd packed their way into the 
gymnasium Friday evening for the 16th annual Intramural 
Night, and witnessed the Grad Eagles 36-27 victory over the 
Grad Physics in the intramural championship basketball 
game, as well as Sigma Nus 56-53 win over the Dorm-Trojans 
in the consoluation encounter. 4 
The evening began as the 
Whales and the Flat Feet , squared 
off on the main court for the 
championship of the jag league.
The Flat Feet jumped out to a 16- 
14 halftime lead behind a 10 point 
outburst by Jeff Toner, but the 
steady play of Russ Freed and the 
.bucket bombing of Peter Ho provs?t*d too much for the Fallen Arches 
to handle in the final quarter, and 
the Whales captured a 30-24 vicjj lory.
;j The consolation game was a nip| and-tuck affair all the way. Gerry 
?! Meiers rippling jump shots gave 
| the Dorm-Trojans a 13-11 first 
ij quarter lead, but high-scoring 
| tactics by John Blue and Dave 
& Vandelinde enabled Sigma Nu lo 
^take a 28-26 lead to the dressing 
r' room at halftime. Gene King and 
j Frank Rizzo kept the Dorm: Trojans in the game during the
j third period, and as the final quar
ter began, they trailed only at 41- 
38. At this point both teams threw 
defense to the winds, and after 8 
minutes of racehorse basketball 
with Lawrence, Blue, and Engelmann firing for Sigma Nu, and 
Dave Kelso retaliating for the 
Dorm-Trojans, SN came out on top 
56-53.
After this game, John Oppenheimer and Harvey Gammon, 
presidents of the l.M. Board and 
Managers Club respectively, pre
sented trophies to the'champions 
of each individual intramural 
sport. The Grad Eagles copped the 
first place awards in football, corec volleyball, and squash, while 
the Dorm-Trojans received tro
phies for volleyball, table tennis, 
and soccer. Alpha Tau Omega re
ceived the water polo trophy, 
while SAE took the honors in 3- 
man volleyball, and BTP did likeTartan Rifle Team Surprises 
All But Gornell At Tournament
v Carnegie Techs varsity rifle team put on its finest shoot
ing performance of the season at Canisius College, placing 
second to Cornell in one of the countrys largest NRA Sec
tional matches. Coached by John Murphy, the Tartans fourman team of Mike Knepley, Phil Meyers, Bob Fritz, and Joe 
Schlitt ran up a score of 1131, good enough to defeat thirtythree teams from eighteen schools.
Carnegie also did well in indiidual competition held on Fri
day Mike Knepley placed sixth 
out of 158 shooters with a 97-95- 
92, 284 score. Phil Meyers was 
eighth with 97-94-92, 283.
Cornell, who had a dismal sea
son befgore coming to Canisius, 
surprised everyone by shooting an 
1143 to walk away with the firstplace trophyThey were helped 
considerably by a fifth-year
shooter, inelibigle for NCAA in
tercollegiate competition, but eligible for NRA matches, who got a 
v 290. Had Cornell been iorced to 
use four men from their varsity 
team, there would have been 
dogfight forfirst place.
In taking second, CIT beat 
many big-name schools, including 
Syracuse, St. Bonaventure, Buf
falo, Akron, Youngstown, Canisius, 
Duquesne, Alfred, Geneva, Clar
ion, Niagara, R.I.T., John Carroll, 
St. Lawrence, Clarkson, and Gan^ non.
Akron, paced by two shapely 
girl shooters, took third place with 
a score of 1129. Jean Linton, a 
well-proportioned blonde and also 
Akrons best shot, took third 
among the individuals with a 285.
Genevas Windhorst won the 
individual trophy with a 286. 
Boysen, from Alfred, took second 
place and high ROTC with a 285. 
'j The Tartans did thoir best 
shooting in the clutch. When they 
went to the range for their first 
relay, it looked like Akrons 1129 
was the score to beat. This meant 
that to win, thet earn had to av
erage better than 282 per man.
No one seemed shaken though, 
as Knepley and Fritz dropped 
only four points in the prone and 
kneeling position. Both fell be. low their usual level in the standwise in bowling and foul shooting. 
To cap off the proceedings, Venu 
Chari and John Williams put on 
an excellent table tennis exhibition.
Then the Grad Eagles and the 
Grad Physics took the floor for 
the championship game. From the(continued on page 8)
ing position though, Knepley with 
an 89, and Fritz an 86, giving 
them 285 and 282 respectively.
This put the pressure on cap
tain Joe Schlitt and Phil Meyers. 
Schlitt, who averaged only 273 
over the season but who had 287,
278, and 276 in recent matches, 
responded with a fine 100-95-84,
279. Steady Phil Meyers shot 
what was exepected of him, a 99- 
94-92, 285.
But then Cornell came through, 
shooting way over their heads to 
finish with 1143 and the sectional 
championship.
This was undobtedly Carnegies 
best performance of the year. 
Each man shot what he was ca
pable of shooting, and the result 
was a fine score and a total of 
eight medals.
CITs second team also gave a 
good account of themselves, fin
ishing with a 1074. Tuck Arnold 
shot his career high of 280, Scott 
McCormick had his usual 272, 
Rich Damberg droped to a 267 
when he finished and shot a zero j 
after eight 10s, in nine shots, and ! 
Jim Burdick had his worst day 
of the yeer, sinking to 258 after a 
276 in the individual competition. 
Dan Mersel placed among the top 
36 individuals with a 278.

opening tip-off both teams went at 
full speed and /the first quarter 
ended with the physics students 
clown only at  11-9. During  the' 
second period, however, they were 
colder than a thermally insulated 
ice-bath, and Andy Komer and 
Howie Pifer pushed the margin to 
28-12. The second half was just 
the reverse of the first. The Grad 
Eagles missed everything and 
then some, and the shooting of 
Oosterhuis, Armistead, and Schoemake gradually narrowed the 
margin until it was 36-27 at the 
final buzzer, and the completion 
of another successful Intramural 
Night.

Something wondcrfuPs happened to Ford Motor 
Company cars! Under the freshest styling seen in 
years, theres a new kind of durability and vigor that 
more than meets the demands of todays and tomor
rows high-speed turnpike driving conditions.
Whats the secret? Quality engineering for total per
formance. Quality engineering so outstanding that 
Ford Motor Company received the NASCAR Achieve
ment Award for engineering excellence which superbly" 
combines the prime essentials of great automobiles1 
performance, reliability, durability, comfort and safety. 
Total performance makes a world of difference. Bodies 
and frames are solid and quiet even on the roughest 
roads. The rides so smooth, so even-keeled, it seems 
to straighten the curves and shorten the miles. And 
nothing matches the spirit, sparkle and stamina of 
advanced Ford-built V-8s and thrifty Sixes. Totalperformance is yours to enjoy in all our 1964 carsfrom
