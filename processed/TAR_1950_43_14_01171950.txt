Coin Settles 
Election Tie 
For Council
Greeks Overshadow 
Independents In Race 
For Engineers Votes
A new switch was added to 
elections procedure last week 
when the winner of the last Mar
garet Morrison Student Council 
seat had to be decided by the 
flip of a coin. The new system of 
two day elections proved its 
merit since 40% of the total bal
lots were marked on Wednesday.
The independents failed to make 
the showing they did last year. 
Five of the seven Engineering and 
Science seats went to fraternity 
men, and no independents won a 
Margaret Morrison position. How
ever, all four Fine Arts openings 
were copped by the independents.
Heads I Win . . .
For the first time in Carnegies 
election history, a candidate was 
seated in Council by the section 
of the by-laws that provides for 
a flip of a coin to break a tie. 
Susanne Menger called the right 
side to beat out Kathryn Ditty for 
the seat.
None of the interest that was 
shown in previous contests was 
evident at this*election. Only 32% 
of the E&S students, 26% of the 
Margaret Morrison girls, and 20% 
Fine Arts students dropped their 
ballots in the boxes in the two 
day election.
Dianne McFarland was elected 
assistant secretary. She will be
come secretary next year when 
the present one retires.
Wednesday Helped
In December Council voted to 
have tbe polls operf two days so 
that students who do not have 
Tuesday classes could vote. This 
extension helped the situation, for 
40% of the ballots came in Wed
nesday.
 These newly elected members 
will be installed at tomorrows 
meeting, and the election of offi
cers for the coming semester will 
be held.
Unpaid Pledges 
Needed Now 
To Close Chest
The Campus. Chest committee 
announced today that approxi
mately $1000 pledged by students 
to the Chest fund has not been 
paid. Since this amount repre
sents ten percent of the entire 
years goal, the committee is anx
ious that it be paid as soon as posble.
All allocation figures were bas
ed on the total income figures in
dicated by both cash contributions 
and pledges, or any sizeable num
ber of unpail pledges will reduce 
greatly the amount ticketed for 
each participating agency.
If the outstanding $1000 is not 
materially reduced by the end of 
this semester, the committee an
nouncement indicates that more 
personal contact with the students 
involved will have to be made. 
However, since this would rpresent the proverbial last resort, 't 
is hoped that the student body will 
respond generously without fur
ther reminding.
A completed report of the Cam
pus Chest drive for the school 
year will appear in the Tartan 
early next semester.

Saturday, February 11, from 9 to 1 in main hall of Fine Arts build
ing. Tickets will be on sale at Skibo and Fine Arts building. Two 
tickets may be bought on one Fine Arts registration card. Tickets 
will cost $1.95 per person. ?--------------------------------------------------
Costumes are restricted to 
black, white, and metallic in keep
ing with the aura of the fan
tastic, the grandiose, and the un
real. Wes Paxkers orchestra will 
provide music for dancing and a 
band of performing vagabonds 
will give the ball a festive note.
Refreshments will be served with 
medieval pomp.
Varied Motifs
Motifs for the various halls in 
which the ball will be held are as 
follows: The Gateway of Hope,
The Scaffold of Reality, The Gate
way of Despair, The Recessional 
Hall of the Entombment, and the 
Pavilion of Supine Pleasures.
On the basis of costumes an 
emperor and empress will be
elected to their glorious stations 
by the Senatus, Populusque, and 
Beaux Artorum after a Grande 
Procession of the Elect. By that 
time your hosts, the present monarchs, will have abdicated.
Famous Tradition 
The Beaux Arts Society hopes 
that the participants in the Ball 
of the Grande Illusion will con
sider the tradition and meaxxing 
of the Beaux Arts Ball and exert 
their imagination and originality 
in the creation of its atmosphere. 
Originated in the academies of 
Europe, the Ball is a scene of 
festive expx*ession and creative, 
not dogmatic, fun-making. It re
quires both planning arid im
provisation.

Editorials
it's Up To Council
The lack of interest shown iA the last Council 
election leaves us very unhappy. It seems only 
a 'hate campaign can bring voters to the polls. 
Then the issues are not based crti the welfare of 
the students, but on power politics.
The only solution to the situation depends 
on Council itself. The lack of interest in Coun
cil Is due to the fact that most of Council's 
actions do not directly effect the entire student 
body. Yet many such problems have existed 
for years and still remain untouched by Coun
cil. The reason is easily seen. These problems 
are difficult to solve; more than one hour a week 
of unprepared debate is necessary just to define 
the problems, and many of the Council mem
bers in the last several semesters were neither 
capable nor willing to attack such problems.
Solution of the drama tickets and parking 
problems would be a step in the right direction. 
When Student Council takes an active interest in 
student problems, the students will take an active 
interest in electing Council members.
Pro anti Con
Fraternities and sororities have once more 
been severely criticized as a dangerous influence 
on college campuses. (See story on this page.) 
This time the charges come from Mrs. Glenn 
Frank, a sorority member and widow of a college 
president, a person who should be well acquaint
ed with the subject she condemns.
Mrs. Frank says that fraternities, in prac
ticing discrimination when choosing their mem
bers, promote a completely un-American, un
democratic caste system. We certainly be
lieve Mrs. Franks use of words is much too 
strong, but we wholeheartedly agree with her 
when it comes to religious discrimination.
An effort to wipe out this type of discrimina
tion was made at the last National Interfraternity 
Conference. Very little wras accomplished al
though continued agitation each year might bring 
tiesired results. However, it seems much easier 
at this time for each fraternity to solve the prob
lem within its chapters rather than trying to 
iorce the issue on a national interfraternity basis. 
It would certainly be a feather in the cap of the 
fraternities on this campus to start the move
ment in their national organizations.
With the same vehemency that we agree 
with Mrs. Frank on that subject, we disagree 
about her charges of screening applicants for 
membership on the basis of income and social 
position. She states that the ingredients for 
success in lifeability, courage and industry, 
are not considered in selecting new fraternity 
members.
The competition (a very American system, 
Mrs. Frank) between fraternities, however, makes 
it a necessity to look for those ingredients when 
choosing new members. No fraternity can exist 
unless it constantly seeks new members who can 
contribute to its progress.

Book Store Renovated; 
Trade Books Added
Complete with bouquets and compliments, 
Carnegies renovated book store opened for busi
ness on January 6. Gone at last are the drab 
appearance and the over-the-counter, buying of 
supplies. Instead, a self-service store with a dra
matic new look has been constructed.
Designed by Ken White and associates of New 
York, the book store is now modern and func
tional. Cream marbelized flooring, better lighting, 
and a new paint job make it seem more spa
cious. Frosted oak shelves and show cases openly 
display books and supplies and invite browsing.
Plastic Palates 
Text books are placed according to content 
and are readily accessible. At the far end of the 
tore, paper, ink. and office supplies are arranged 
for easy selection. In the art department, the 
paint drawers have plastic palates on the out
side daubed with the color of the paint. Pencils 
of every grade and color are in open compart
ments for quick and easy selection. Everything 
about the arrangement spells speed and efficiency.
One of the best new features is what is termed 
the trade books department. It contains items 
ranging from Aristotles treatises to Peter Arnos 
cartoons. There are pocket books for leisure read
ing, the college outline series for exam cram
ming, all types of juvenile books for nieces and 
nephews, non-fiction books to satisfy every in
terest, and almost all the best sellers.
Ordering Service 
Several other innovations have been instituted 
for the convenience and economy of the students, 
faculty, and personnel. Mrs. Morse, head of the 
trade books department, will be glad to order 
pre-publication books, both fiction and non-fic
tion. By ordering with a dollar deposit, both the 
pre-publication reduction and the book store dis
count will result.
Special orders will be taken at any time for 
both text and trade books. Those who find a book 
which strikes their fancy without having ready 
cash available will appreciate the lay-away plan 
now in effect.
Rushes Still Problem 
The solution of the annual fall rush bas not 
been completely formulated, but Mr. Cummings, 
manager of the book store, is studying the ar
rangements made by book stores in other col
leges. The turnstiles will be able td regulate the 
flow of traffic, and with the various supplies 
classified in well-marked sections, everything in
dicates quicker service.
The book store is to acquire an even more 
diversified election of school supplies to meet 
the increasing demand of the student. However, 
even in its renovated condition, the book store is 
still open to suggestions for improvement, stated 
Mr. Cummings.
MMCC Class 
Picks Mrs. Clark 
Woman Of Year
Some CIT Women students feel 
there neednt be any conflict be
tween the home and a career. 
They like them both.
The students, all members of 
the journalism class in MMCC, 
backed up their opinion this week 
by voting Mrs. Georgia Neese 
Clark, treasurer of the United 
States, their Woman o fthe Year.
According to the girls, Mrs. 
Clark best demonstrates how a 
woman can have an important 
career without sacrificing a welladjusted home life.
The first woman treasurer outballoted Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt 
and Mrs. Perle Mesta to win the 
award.
Widow Claims 
Fraternities 
Discriminate
The dangerous influence wield
ed by sororities and fraternities on 
college campuses is greater today 
than ever before, according to 
Mrs. Glenn Frank, widow of the 
former president of the University 
of Wisconsin and a former sorority 
member, who has just published 
the results of a special investiga
tion in the February issue of 
PAGEANT Magazine, now on 
sale.
In Citadels of Snobbery, Mrs. 
Frank warns that sororities and 
fraternities promote a complete
ly un - American, undemocratic 
caste system.
Tragedies Result
She charges that the fraternity 
and sorority practice of screening 
applicants for membership on the 
basis of income, religion and so
cial position is responsible for in
numerable personal tragedies. She 
disagrees with those who brush 
away failure to make a fraternity 
with the excuse Thats life, and 
points out that the ingredients for 
success in life  ability, courage 
and industry, are not considered in 
selecting new fraternity members.
Mrs. Frank reports that frater
nities and sororities practice re
ligious discrimination by setting 
quotas for Catholic students and 
banning Jews. As a result, she 
says, Jewish students have been 
forced to form their own group*, 
thus creating segregation on the 
campus.
NEW IDEAS . . . The Thistle 
plans a section on  campus views 
done in bas relief, and another 
section on campus personalities. 
Neither of these two were yicluded in last years book.
* * *
SUCCESS . . . The Sink has re
ceived the following tip: The girl 
on page 77 of the Life magazine 
of October 31 is a CIT art school 
graduate. Quite an honor to rate 
a full page in Life. Signed, An
other 36er.'
The card was mailed to the 
Tartan, c/o C. I. Teck.
She was Sue Fuller. The picture 
showed her seated before her 
handiworka large picture frame 
patterned by brightly colored 
strings stretched from side to side 
and corner to corner.

DEAD . . . Delayed rushing, in 
any form whatsoever, is dead. 
Council of Fraternity Presidents 
killed it about two months ago. 
The idea was brought up early in 
the year . . . giving the entering 
students a break; delay rushing 
until the second semester; give 
them a chance to get settled into 
school life; and then whirl them 
into the social life. From one pro
posal the idea spread to another, 
slightly different, and another and 
. . . it ended up with six separate 
plans for fraternity rushing rules. 
The one that won out: keep things 
as they are with only minor 
changes.* * *
GOOD BYE! . . . Henry Morgan 
is off the air again. Replacing his 
Friday nite riot is the brand new 
comedy team of Mr. and Mrs. 
Ronald Colman (The Halls of 
Ivy). Colman, one of the few 
silent picture stars to survive the 
talkies, has been acting for 27 
years.# * .*
REMAKE . . . The Ladys At 
Work, Scotch and Sodas show of 
two years ago, was recently pre
sented at the Carl Fischer Audi
torium in New York. George
Wood, the author, made a few re
visions, called the result, Of 
Sugar And Spice. Helping him 
were Bill Putch (co-author of last 
years epic) and Priscilla Mor
rill. She had a part in The Ladys 
At Work.* * *
ANCIENT HISTORY . . . Foot
ball, in 1889, was different. Take 
it from one who played. .Back 
then we didnt have the downs 
system. We carried the ball to a 
touchdown or the other team took 
it away from us. We didnt play 
quarters, just two 30-minute 
halves. No reserve teams sat on 
the bench; only a few extras were 
on hand in case someone was 
thrown too hard.
Touchdowns counted four 
points, the conversion two. And 
to get an extra point you had to 
kick from where the runner went 
over.
I dont think football was quite 
as rough when we played it; we 
tackled hard, piled up, developed 
cauliflower ears from playing 
without helmets but we didnt 
have as many injuries. Even 
teachers played.

Exhibition By Sam Rosenberg 
Now At Arts And Craft Center
Retroactive Show Includes Sixty Paintings 
By Teacher Called Man Of The Year In Art
The artist does not see things as they are, but as he is.
This axiom of the art world seems to be particularly true of 
Samuel Rosenberg, the Carnegie professor whose works are being 
displayed in a one-man show, Samuel Rosenberg Retrospective 
Exhibition of Paintings, at the*'
Arts and Crafts Center on Fifth 
Avenue.
The more than sixty paintings 
by the art professor, who has 
been named man of the year in 
art by the Center, include some 
of his earliest works in addition 
to many of his most recent.
Having displayed talent for art 
from an early age, Professor Ro
senberg spent many years trans
ferring to canvas scenes of Pitts
burgh. He haunted tenements, 
markets, factories and street cor
ners, and captured in his paint
ing the spirit of the things he saw.
He has been a teacher of draw
ing and art for nearly twentyfive years, having joined the Car
negie faculty in 1925, one year 
before he received his own de
gree from that school.
As a professor of art, he has 
taught many of the contemporary 
artists of America. Revered by 
his students for his friendliness 
and understanding assistance, he 
has been a great influence in the 
lives of many of them.
The Rosenberg Retrospective 
Exhibition will be shown at the 
Arts and Crafts Center through 
Tuesday, January 31. The gal
leries will be open from 10 a. m. 
to 5 p. m. weekdays, 10 a. m. to 
6 p. m. Saturdays, 2 p. m. to 10 
p. m. Sundays, and on Wednesday 
evenings from 7 p. m. to 10 p. m.
Dr. H. A. Simon 
Delivers Talk
Metals Club Features 
Theory Of Games Lect
Did you know that you cant 
win in a poker game?
This, together with other inter
esting information about the 
mathematical theory of games 
will be presented by Dr. H. A. 
Simon of the industrial adminis
tration department at the meet
ing of the CIT Metals club on 
Tuesday, February 14.
Dr. Simon, who has made ex
tensive studies of the mathemat
ical colloquium on this subject. He 
stated that for a poker player who 
never bluffs it is theoretically im
possible to win, or even to break 
even over a long period. Further, 
he declared, if two persons match 
pennies long enough, eventually 
one will have all the pennies.
Because of the nature of this 
program, all interested students 
and faculty are invited to attend 
the meeting; and an invitation is 
extended especially to the various 
departmental clubs. Following the 
talk and a discussion period, re
freshments will be served for 75c.
Announcement of the exact time 
and place of this meeting will be 
made in the next issue of the Tar
tan.

Elections Postponed 
Until Next Semester 
By Student Council
The class reorganization com
mittee has reported a lack of in
terest in the sophomore class elec
tion.
Only four petitions for president 
have been filed. Five E&S men 
have submitted petitions, while 
one Fine Arts student has enter
ed on the vice-president slate 
there.
One person has submitted for 
the position of secretary. There 
have been no petitions filed for 
vice-president from Margaret 
Morrison and three persons elect
ed to run for the office of treasur
er.
Because of the poor showing, 
the executive committee of Stu
dent Council has postponed the 
election until next semester.
Cwens and Scimitars have as
sured Council that the sophomores 
were interested and would co
operate in the class reorganization 
program.
Positions may now be picked up 
in the Dean of Mens office. They 
are due Friday, January 20.
pleted, Council turned to other, 
and more difficult, problems at it? 
last meeting. The athletic depart
ments financial inability to pro
vide meals during football train
ing, the Scots deficit, and thtf'dra
ma departments ticket problem 
are all potential Gordian knots in 
the campus lifeline.
Kampus Kops
As a partial palative for the in
creasing congestion of school park
ing areas, Council has suggested 
that a system of fines be imposed 
on violators. The cars of all vio
lators are to be tagged, the first 
offense resulting in a warning and 
subsequent infringements in a 
five dollar fine payable in the 
cashiers office.
The issue of the Scot which ap
peared just before the Christmas 
holiday was a financial failure, 
but the staff feels that this red 
ink can be turned to black in 
forthcoming numbers. In the light 
of this optimism, Council decided 
to keep the pursestrings open.
One of the larger, and unnec
essary, expenses of the athletic 
department accrues from the large 
sums paid for the tutoring of 
athletes behind in their studies. 
This added drain on the already 
depleted coffers of Buddy Over
ends department will mean no 
training table for the footballers 
during spring training.
As vs. Touchdowns
Council is making a plea to 
the honoraries, both Tau Beta Pi 
and the engineering Greeks, for 
capable people to instruct athletes 
free of charge. The money thus 
saved will be used toward better 
football in the future.
The distribution of play tickets, 
always a sore spot,' is again in 
the fore. Though the dramats 
have changed the hotirs of issu
ance, the problem of inefficiency 
in the handling of students de
siring tickets is not so easily solv
ed. The department is welcoming 
any suggestions.

4TAWANTUESDAY, JANUARY 17, 1950
string of scor 
from the side.
Bill Dorn
The Old Pro has returned to form and it makes a world of 
difference.
In the most sensational week of his long, brilliant career at 
Carnegie, captain Mike Theodore has shaken his scoring lethargy 
and led a Tartan team, rapidly being tabbed as great, to two decisive 
victories.
But even the veteran pivot mans gallant performances can
not detract from the truly amazing work turned out by a sturdy 
crew of Jack Riehl, Tommy Beck, freshman Tom Craig, and 
I.en Bianchi.
Riehl, the new Plaid workhorse, has been a marked man since 
his early season rampages which found him leading the scoring 
column. With Theodores comeback, however, he has willingly given 
Tip this spot and settled back to his playmakers position only to 
shine even more brightly than before.
Beck, on the other hand, has been coasting along almost un
noticed, but has been a most deciding factor in the late develop
ments. At 511, the ex-North Catholic master ball handler has been 
nothing short of phenomenal under the boards. Against the Nittany 
Lion skyscrapers he combined with Theodore and Riehl to gain vir
tual control of the rebounds despite the physical disadvantage.
The hard fighting Craig has performed with the finesse of 
a seasoned veteran even with his lack of experience, while the 
cool and collected Bianchi has at times helped steady a falter
ing drive.
Yet the truly outstanding contribution to the double win over 
Pitt and Penn State was made by Theodore. Almost as if he had 
saved himself for his arch rivals, the Plaid ace found his scoring 
punch as quickly as he had lost it and reeked his vengeance on 
the Panthers.
Theodores sudden about face, it must be remembered, resulted 
in more than a mere increase in the scoring column by his addi
tional points. The threat presented by the talented sharp shooter 
necessitated a shift in the opposing defense, thereby relaxing the 
strain on other phases of the Plaid offense.
The fact that Tie could be relied upon to come through when 
needed had the added effect of instilling confidence, and with it a 
greater efficiency into the remaining four Scots.
It is quite significant to note, though, that with only two 
additions from last year, Bianchi and the newcomer Craig, a 
most remarkable reversal of form in the team has developed. The 
answer, of course, lies with a rookie coaching combination that 
has already exceeded the hopes of its most ardent admirers.
Likeable Mel Cratsley, after two years as assistant mentor has 
welded together one of the districts leading fives. At his side has 
been Moe Fassinger, ex-Muny League star and one time Duquesne 
scout, who is getting his first taste of the coaching profession.
Together these men have been the guiding forces in the pro
duction of the aggressive and well-drilled quintet that is carrying the 
Plaid to new heights.
Almost overlooked in the excitement surrounding the head
line making wins was the fact that these were accomplished 
without the services of two men who figured to be stalwarts 
on the local squad. Tasso Katselas, called home due to the 
serious illness of his father, and the injured Hilary Holste were 
absent from both contests.

Bulldogs Lose ToSAE Five 
In Second Court Appearance
By Bruce Updike
A scrappy SAE basketball quintet threw caution to the winds 
and subdued the growling Faculty Bulldogs in a rough and tumble 
IM game last Friday. In the first period the Bulldogs drew first 
blood as Sergeant Brown bruised Arne Oberg of SAE. A minute
later Brown was the victim and he* ~ ~
selves, and the basket, in the third
quarter and traded punches on 
even terms with SAE. Haynes hit 
the hoop from the side. Brown 
scored easily on a fast break. The 
Sarge then threw the ball out to
At this pin't^Coach Sie Strick | H,?yn<f "ndor. *hheother tally ai\d the Bulldogs startput the Bulldogs into the game by 
sinking one foul. Dean Dickinson 
impressed the referee with the 
pained expression on his face and 
the Dean racked up another point 
for the Faculty.
Machine Gun Reed
substituted Sergeant Reed in the 
Faculty lineup to add a little scorj 
ing punch to the tiring Bulldog 
five. Reed promptly took a shot 
from the side court which missed ! 
the basket, the backboard and, | 
just barely, the window.
A perfect block by Ray Haynes i 
gave SAE another free throw and 
put the Bulldogs another point 
behind. Paul Walsh of the Faculty 
was a little too eager for the ball | 
end clobbered Salem Toney.
Dickinson innocently bounced j 
off SAEs Tom Graham and the 
fraternity man added an additional j 
point to the score. Just before the 
half the Bulldogs muffed a golden 
opportunity to score as Reed mis
sed a free throw. The scoring dur
ing the first half was not all in 
favor of the Bulldogs and at the ; 
end of two periods of play SAE 
led 27-6.
Bulldogs Bite Back
Ahe faculty club found them,
ed to look like a basketball team. 
Then Haynes got excited and 
threw the ball at your reporter.
Haynes was still warm so he 
tried a shot from the corner and 
somehow the ball found the hoop 
again. McCune stole the ball for 
the fraternity boys and the frus
trated Brown raised his fist, hop
ing McCune would run into it.
Old Army Game
To pacify the Sarge, McCune 
fouled him and the Army man 
scored for the Bulldogs. Haynes 
blasted through the center of the 
keyhole on a follow up and left 
McCune flat on the floor. The last 
two minutes of play saw terrific 
aggfessive action and now the 
floor wont have to be polished for 
another week. Although the Bull
dogs matched their opponents 
scoring in the second half, they 
could not overcome their deficit 
and SAE came out on top, 45-24.
TARTANS OVERCOME LIONS' HEIGHT
Lenny Bianchi, partially hidden, leaps high into the air to take

Plaid Quintet Smothers 
Pitt In 62-42 Rout
Mike Theodore returned to form and Carnegie Tech revenged a 
long list of University of Pittsburgh basketball victories by smother
ing the Panthers, 62-42, at Pitt Stadium last Wednesday.
For almost a week Coach Mel Cratsley carefully prepared his 
charges for the intra-city strug-?---------------------------------------------------
gle. His work paid off as the 
unique Pitt offense found itself 
completely bottled up, while the 
Plaid quintet, sparked by the 
ever-amazing Theodore, consist
ently drove through to the basket.
Impressive Win
In the dressing room following 
the game there was little com
motion, but a row of broad smiles 
told a story in themselves. This 
was the most vital game on the 
schedule to date,, and they had 
won it in their most impressive 
manner.
With a combination man-toman and zone defense which 
found Theodore floating in the 
pivot spot, Carnegie proved to the 
basketball world that the ancient 
Figure-Eight offense is a thing 
of the past. Only one layup shot 
and very few others from within 
the foul circle were granted the 
Panthers, who were permitted to 
take their set shots at will from 
far out.
Defense Backfires
Panther mentor Dr. H. C. Carl
son, taking his cue from a suc
cessfulWestminster five, used a 
pressing man-to-man defense 
which promptly backfired in his 
squads face. The Tartan five 
criss-crossed with brilliant pre
cision in the back court and found 
little trouble working the ball 
past mid-court.
Slippery Rock 
Drowns Plaid; 
Macy Stars
Coach Huron Smiths Slippery 
Rock mermen won both relays 
and scored heavily in the diving, 
backstroke, end breaststroke 
events to route the Tartan swim
ming team 46 to 29.
The meet was the Tartans first 
of the season. Coached by Claude 
Sofield, the Plaid mermen made a 
promising showing in the free
style events, but lack of . depth, a 
recognized pre-season shortcom
ing, took its toll in the relay 
events.
A1 Macy, big gun for the Tartan 
cause, scored first place victories 
in both the 220 and 440 yard free
style events. Nick Demas, also of 
Tech, chipped in with a first place 
in the 50 yard freestyle and nar
rowly missed doing the trick again 
when he was edged in the hun
dred.
The Plaid squad will try to 
even the score this Saturday when 
they face a well balanced team 
of swimmers from Case Tech at 
the Carnegie pool.

The battle will mark the first

of a home-and-home series.
14 points in the second half/ Penn 
State managed to tie the game 
twice at 25-25 and 33-33 but 
never again went ahead.
On To Work 
With the score at 33-33, Car
negie promptly went to work. 
Mike Theodore started the rally 
with a push shot from the foul 
circle. Craig followed with an 
amazing jump shot close in. Jack 
Riehl, after two tries, sunk a long 
set shot and Theodore followed 
with two more buckets, one on a 
jump and another on a push. Beck 
figured in the scoring again with 
another push shot. Riehl followed 
up with a driving layup and Beck 
came back with another "push shot. 
At the end of this rally, the score 
read 50-40 Carnegie, the Tartans 
getting 17 points to Penn States 7. 
With two minutes to go, the Plaid 
did not stop. Joe Matsey got loose 
under the basket and on a pass 
from Theodore, made the layup 
good. Beck, on r drive, went in 
with a hook shot and made it good 
for two more points. Beck was 
fouled on this play and made his 
14th point when he sunk a free 
throw. Another score came on a 
layup by Matsey and the 57th 
point was made on a free throw 
by Theodore. Penn State got its 
last two points on two free throws, 
making the final score 57-42.
The Tartans seemed to have 
their shooting eye last night by 
making 42 per cent of their shots 
from the floor and the outstanding 
playing of the Tartans were con
stantly applauded by the fans and 
on many occasions they rose and 
gave a tremendous ovation.

Guidance Bureau Staff 
Offers Varied Advice
If you had the opportunity to be chairman of spring carnival 
committee this year, would you accept the job? The prestige and 
power associated with such a position would, of course, be gratifying. 
On the other hand, the worries and woes connected would be about 
ten times as great as they are^ '
gratifying. Would you take the! 
job?
As a student at Carnegie you 
have little cause for worry. You 
have less than one chance in 
three thousand of ever experienc
ing this particular situation.
Yes Or No
Now, the odds will not always 
be 3000 to 1 in your favor; soon
er or later an answer, a yes or 
no. will be expected of you. Grant
ed, your decision will not always 
commit you to a chairmanship.

Nevertheless, you face daily situ
ations which are similar to this
question; similar because each sit
uation demands an acceptance or 
rejection of responsibility.
Yearly hundreds of Tech stu
dents find themselves floundering 
in difficulty, not knowing what 
to do, in need of advice. Some 
three hundred of these find their 
way to the office (IH 342) of Pro
fessor Roland C. Moore. They 
want help and Professor Moore 
and his staff are there for just 
that purpose.
Face Facts
The people who work in the 
Bureau of Measurement and Guid
ance know how difficult it can be 
for a person to face facts square
ly and make a decision. As head 
of the bureau, Professor Moore 
listens to the worries of many a 
student. Once he has all the avail
able facts he helps settle the is
sue. He doesn't settle it; he helps 
settle it.
After the problem has been 
diagnosed by the staff and ex
plained to the student the usual 
difficulty confronting the bureau 
is that of inducing the student to 
accept responsibility and make 
decisions in relation to his partic
ular problem.
Members Teach
The Bureau of Measurement 
and Guidance, which is concerned 
with these and other student prob
lems, functions as a supplement 
to the Dean of Mens office. The 
members of the staff, in addition '
Mr. Roland C. Moore
to their regular duties, teach in 
the psychology department.
Dr. Miner. Professor Gilmore 
and Professor Moore form a gen
eral steering committee. The re
mainder of the staff includes Mr. 
Morgan, Mr. Needham, and Miss 
James.
Available To You
Although the bureau contacts 
over 10% of the student body 
each year, there are probably 
more who need its services. Many 
persons hardly realize what is 
available to them. The bureau of
fers the same confidential service 
one would expect from a practic

On December 6th
On Tuesday evening, December

Pi initiated a class of new mem
bers. Five Evening School students 
received recognition, and the rec
ords indicate that this was the 
largest number of evening stu
dents to be accepted for a number 
of years.
Tau Beta Pi members are se
lected from the junior and senior 
students who have maintained 
high scholastic ratings in the Col

Membership in the association is 
a mark of distinction that is worth 
the effort required to obtain it, 
and any engineering student is eli

Evening Council Backs 
Semi - Formal Dance
March 18 Dance Approved 8 To 3;
Rowland And Keller. Co-Chairmen
When the Social Chairman, John Miller, asked Student Council 
for a recommendation concerning the type of dance suitable for 
Saturday, March 18, he learned that the members were divided in 
their opinions. ?-----------------------------------------------------
The expression of personal 
views indicated that one faction 
favored a semi-formal dance on 
the basis that many students have 
asked for that type of dance and 
Council should sponsor a semiformal affair on an experimental 
basis. Several members lent sup
port to the proposal, asserting that 
formal affairs are generally ac
cepted by college students as one 
of the desirable aspects of col
lege life.
Objections Citd
The other faction based their 
beliefs on past experience in other 
organizations. It was alleged that 
the Evening School student is 
principally interested im "Education, 
home life and pei*Sonal welfare. 
Social affairs are relatively unim
portant to him aixd though he 
would have no objection to' at
tending an informal dance, he 
may encounter problems that 
would prevent him from attend
ing a semi-formal dance.
The members were asked to 
consider the various items that 
had been discussed, but to make 
a selection on the basis of what 
might be acceptable to the stu
dent body and most successful 
financially rather than on personal 
feelings. A semi-formal dance
