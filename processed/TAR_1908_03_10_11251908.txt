VOL. ITI, No. 10 PITTSBURG, PA., WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 25, 190S TEN CENTS
BSt nOft TOCt
We took another one of the defeats that have 
come to be our regular fate, more or less gracefully, 
last Saturday. Although we have not been smiled 
on by fortune lately, there certainly was something 
else amiss in the Case game. We seem to place too 
much confidence in one or two of our players and 
if they are absent from the game every man on the 
team seems to lose instead of acquiring more ginger 
to offset the handicap.
No man onthe team can be blamed for a poor 
game as every man seemed to be working hard; 
but there didnt seem to be the team work that there 
was earlier in the season.
Dowling was certainly our star performer and his 
work saved us the disgrace of going through the 
game without making first down. Hatcher put up 
a good game barring his misjudgment of punts and 
if Hittner can get in the game tomorrow the three 
men named should make the speediest backfield we 
have had this year. Our forward pass only worked 
successfully once.
We won the toss and defended the north goal. 
Orr kicked off to Dowling, who ran it back 30 yards. 
Hatcher tried a quarterback run, but lost the ball on 
a fumble on the 25-yard line. Ziegler gained four 
yards at right tackle. On the next play Heller made 
eight yards through the same place. Heller and Zieg
ler then made first down on two line plunges and 
Heller was sent over for the first touchdown on an 
end run, after five minutes of play. Heller kicked 
goal. ScoreCase 6, Tech 0.
Brown then kicked to Reimenschneider, who made 
a run of 25 yards through a broken field, but was 
brought down by Dowling, after a flying tackle.
Emerson punted 35 yards to Hatcher, who fumbled.
Rudolf gained five yards at center, but Referee Ed. 
Young penalized Case 15 yards for holding. Ziegler 
was sent against right tackle for eight yards. Emer
son punted to Hatcher, who called for a free catch 
on his own 20-yard line. Frampton gained four yards 
at center, but Dowling could not gain around right 
end. Frampton punted 40 yards to Williams, who 
was downed in his tracks by Hatcher.
Ziegler was sent three times against TecTis line, 
for good gains, but Case was again penalized for 
holding. Case tried to regain by a series of end runs, 
but was unable to negotiate the required distance, 
Tech gaining the ball on downs.
Frampton then punted from behind the goal posts 
to Williams, who was unable to run it back more than 
five yards. Ziegler was then sent for five straight 
times against Techs line, bringing the ball down 
to Techs nine-yard line, where Reimenschneider was 
sent through for the second touchdown.
The third touchdown was made by straight foot
ball. Reimenschneider, Heller, Ziegler and Williams 
gaining at will. Williams was elected to make the 
third touchdown and was sent through light guard 
for two yards. Emerson failed to bring back Framptons kickoff, Reimenschneider and Williams failed 
to make first down, so Case was forced to punt. 
Emerson punted fully 50 yards and sent the ball back 
of Techs goal line. The ball was brought out and 
Frampton punted 40 yards to Reimerschneider. Hel
ler, Ziegler and Reimenschneider brought the ball 
down the field on a series of line plunges. Ziegler 
being sent over for a touchdown. Shortly after this 
the whistle blew with the ball in Cases possession 
on its own 20-yard line. In the second half the only 
touchdown was made on two forward passes and

GET THE SOUVENIR.
The Souvenir Program for the W. & J-. game on 
Thanksgiving Day will contain some new and novel 
features. In addition to the usual scoring places, 
line-up, photographs of team, captains, managers, 
coaches, it will contain individual statistics of the 
members of the two teams during the present sea
son. Every student in the schools should buy a 
copy at the reasonable priGe asked, 10 cents, to pre
serve as a souvenir of the season of 1908. The 
cover design is by Brandy Smith.
1911NIGHT.
At a class meeting held two weeks ago, the boys 
decided to concentrate their energies on the annual 
smoker. The one to be held this year will be the 
third of its kind, originated by 1911, and, while fol
lowing out the general lines of its predecessors, will 
be as much greater than the last as that was than 
the first. It is intended to throw this one open to 
the whole school as was done before and a large 
crowd is assured.
H. M. Laithe has been forced to absent himself 
lately, but promises to come out again soon. While 
we are glad to see any of the boys rome back, 
Laithe is especially welcome, as his talents would 
be missed by the whole school.
Locke is still out, but intends coming back. Re
membering where good intentions are supposed to 
be of the most use, we hope that Cupids will not 
become a paving-block.
Munk has a new name for changing class rooms: 
he calls it changing stalls. Quite appropriate, 
Munk.
Grand Prize!
Five dollars will be paid for the best joke about 
Wilharms pipe. For particulars, inquire of F. C. 
Wilharm, 1911.
Ask Fisher about his valentine. He has a new 
geometrical shape to show an equation for.

THE PLEBE CLASS ENTERTAINS.
Friday afternoon, the Plebes entertained the mem
bers of the Faculty, the Senior and Junior classes 
with a continuous vaudeville performance. The 
stage was decorated with countless blue pennants 
bearing the class numerals in orangethe Plebe col
ors. A cunning little page posted the placards an
nouncing the various numbers of the program and 
made himself/ or rather herself, generally useful.
The first number on the program was a chorus, 
The Whistling Girls, by the classin costumes 
presumably borrowed from their brothers.
The second number was a monologue entitled 
Mothers Nap, very creditably performed by Miss 
Plimpton.
Next, Miss Irene Deeds gave The Impressions of 
a Plebe in child dialect and costume. This clever 
little sketch furnished us with the history of the 
class up to date.
Following this, the placard announced An Ex
travaganza. After a few minutes of expectancy, 
the little page appeared between the curtains and 
informed us that the piano was sadly out of tune, 
but Madame would play under protest. Then Miss 
Stewart convulsed us by playing very solemnly In 
the Shade of the Old Apple Tree, with a few extra 
sharps.
The next number was a pantomime, by Miss Les
lie, Miss Hunter and Miss White, in which Miss 
Leslie put a gentleman caller to sleep by reading 
from a book she was much interested in. Miss 
While took the part of the irate father.
Then came a piano lecture-recital by Madame 
Ausderhoe, entitled The Desert and the Oasis. 
The charming manner of Miss Becker as she re
cited this thrilling tale, and her delightful illustra
tions on the piano captivated the audience, and she 
received generous applause.
Miss Ruth Turkle recited in costume a humorous 
poem entitled The Puzzled Dutchman, and clat
tered her wooden shoes in true Dutch style.
Then the page announced Little Nannette, and 
Miss Helen Baglin appeared in a pink frock and hat 
with a huge Teddy Bear under her arm, and sang 
The Teddy Bear Song. She was encored, and 
sang a little slumber song very sweetly.
Then followed a very pretty dance by Miss Mar
tha Wiley and Miss Mary Morrow in imitation of the 
famous Hengler Sisters. This was also encored.
By far the cleverest stunt on the program was the 
Pittsburg Symphony Orchestra, assisted by Mad
ame Blatavski. The musicians came straggling in 
after the approved fashion, and began the nerve 
wrecking process of tuning their instruments, which 
were mostly the combs and tissue paper of childhood 
days. After an interval, the concertmeister (Miss 
Alice Fuchs), strolled in with a toy violin under her

THE TARTAN
arm. Last came the conductor (Miss Olive Powell), 
who, after a musicianly bow, rapped for attention 
and the concert was begun. The first number was 
that familiar classic, Love Me, and the World is 
Mine, followed by a medley of familiar airs. Then 
the conductor, in a gallant manner, escorted the so
loist to the piano. Miss Steiners playing was splen
did and greatly enjoyed by all. Once more the con
ductors baton brought the orchestra to attention 
and the concluding number was rendered with much 
feeling. The conducting was above reproachCreatore himself could not have outdone Miss Powell. 
The only point on which she could be criticised was 
her inability to resist feeling of her hair! And we 
wonder if conductors are in the habit of passing 
around their red silk handkerchiefs!
The entertainment was brought to a close with 
a tableau of the entire class, each girl holding a 
class pennant. All joined in their class song to the 
tune of Harrigan:
M. M. C. S.Yes
Is the finest, all confess.
We, the Plebes, have tried our best to show you
All the talent that there lies below you.
M. M. C. S.Yes!
Cheer for nineteen leveu!
For we show
That we know
To whom we owe, our advantages.
Carnegie!thats he:
Every one was loud in the praise of 1911 as they 
were being served with refreshment in the lunch 
room, and voted the entertainment quite the clev
erest that has been given in our school. Much 
credit is due to Miss Stoner and Miss Fisher, who 
drilled the girls so faithfully. We all feel that a 
vote of thanks is due the Plebes for the pleasant 
afternoon and the splendid entertainment they gave 
us.
Several of the girls were speaking of the Faculty 
dance held on Wednesday afternoon. Miss Griffin 
(who has been more or less asleep) suddenly sits 
up and inquires, And did they all come in their 
gym suits?
The others promptly went into hysterics.
The girls of Morrison Hall visited the Home for 
Crippled Children one evening last week for the 
purpose of telling stories to the poor little unfortu
nates there. Of course, the stories told were all of 
the kind approved in the Ethics Class as proper 
bedtime talescalculated to have a quieting effect 
on the little minds and to still childish fears. All 
went well and the children were delighted. When 
about to leave, the girls were urged to come again. 
Then up piped a little voice, And, say! next time 
you come, wont you please tell us an EXCITING 
story?
The Senior Dance.
The Senior Class gave an informal dance Tuesday 
evening, November 17th, in the faculty rooms. The 
halls were made cozy with pennants and cushions 
and house plants, and proved very inviting between 
dances. Dainty sandwiches and coffee were served 
during the intermission. Although not on the pro
gram, the moonlight dance proved to be one of the 
most enjoyable features of the evening. Miss Smith 
and the new members of the faculty were our guests, 
and also our chaperons. About eighty were in at
tendance and all voted the dance a very enjoyable 
affair."rV  -
The Civic Exhibit.
The civic exhibit in the Carnegie Art galleries 
will remain until December 6. It contains displays 
showing existing conditions in this country and 
abroad in housing, sanitation, and other lines of 
civic reform. The local exhibit is of unusual inter
est and should be studied by all Pittsburgers. It is 
hoped that all the girls will visit the galleries before 
the exhibit closes, for they will find it both interest
ing and instructive.
The American Civic Club was entertained at the 
school on Thursday afternoon. The girls of the 
Senior Class were stationed in different parts of the 
building to explain the working of the classes to the 
visitors. Tea and chocolate were served in the 
Faculty rooms.
After the visitors had been through the building, 
the Seniors were invited to come to the Faculty 
rooms. It was the occasion of Mrs. Hamerschlag's 
announcing to the Faculty and Senior Class the 
engagement of Miss Smith to Mr. Harry Hart of the 
Eureka Ranch, Montana. This came as a very great 
surprise to us all. While we rejoice in Miss Smiths 
happiness, we are pained at the thought of losing 
her. She has consoled us, however, by promising 
to remain with us until after commencement.
Proper Plays for Children.
Gracious! children, stop that noise, cried 
mother.
But were playing war, objected the eldest.
What? You mustn't play war on Sunday.
But, ma, this is a religious war.
Miss West (wishing to speak to the history class) 
May I have the floor, Miss Harding?
Miss HardingYes, if you can take it from the 
engine.
Miss Beymer has been seeing things at night 
recently. We wonder if its stolen fruits, or con
science, or both.

Mrs. Solomons Sayings.
Verily,. my daughter, three things a man hateth 
even these three:
1. A house in which the furniture is too good to 
be sat upon and the chairs too good to hold his feet.
2. A woman who attempteth to convince him 
that he is wrongand succeedeth in doing it.
3. To be found out.
Yea,' a fourth thing and a fifth he despiseth; for 
a weeping woman is unto her husband as a spigot 
that leaketh and maketh a distracting noise; but a 
lady conversationalist is as a fire that sputtereth, 
and he fleeth in terror before her. For in conversa
tion, as in life, a man wanteth only an audience.
Verily, ,She who hath studied the ologies and discourseth thereon is as a foolish child besida she whu
asketh a man questions concerning himself. For a 
man that talketh of books and politics and new 
thought wearieth withal; but a man that talketh of 
himself tireth never.
Yea, my daughter, there are but two ways round
a man; one leadeth through his vanity and the
other through his fear. For while a woman may 
bully her way over a man, she can always smile her 
way straight through him. The wise woman knoweth this and weareth always the smile that wont 
come off.
Word comes from the dormitory that there has re
cently been a man in the house. However, this 
merely hearsay. We have a strong suspicion that 
it was not a real flesh and blood man, but one of 
those apparitions "lone women are credited with 
seeing so frequently after dark.
At a meeting of the third-year night ciass the fol
lowing officers were elected:

Mr. Morgans compliments to Mr. Farrell of 1913. 
Mr. Morgan would be dee-lighted to hold Mr. Far
rells locker key while he (the latter) plays foot
ball Thursday morning.
For the benefit of our readers who may not know 
the inside history of the affair we will say, that as 
a result of Farrell's obliging spirit Morgan had to go 
home in his foot-ball suit Saturday afternoon, while 
Farrell, unmindful of the disturbance he was un
consciously making, mingled with the Tech rooters 
at the Case game. And Farrell could not be found. 
And Mr. Woodward could not obtain the master key. 
And Morgan lives in Braddock. Wouldnt it have 
been awful if that had been his Sunday-go-meeting 
clothes locked in the locker? Twould have been 
worse yet had Morgan caught Farrell.
Plans are on foot for sending Gunpowder Pete 
down to Texas with Stuart when the Xmas vacation 
comes.
1912 Victors.
In a rather rough game the 1912 team defeated the 
Avalon ex-High team, 20 to 6, last Saturday afternoon 
on the formers field. The visitors were somewhat 
inclined toward a fist-fight instead of a foot-ball 
game, but the atmosphere generally cleared after 
some wind-jamming and spouting had been indulged 
in by both sides. Wayman kicked off at 2.15 to 
Hensel, who carried the ball about 20 yards for the 
Avalons before being downed. After about two min
utes play, Bates scored a touchdown for the visitors.

---------------------------------------------------

THETA RTAN7
After that the game was all 1912, the Avalons re
gaining the ball but once only to have 1912 recover 
it in a minute or so. .
The 12 team played as a unit, and the Avalons 
were helpless. Each man played without a flaw, but 
the features of the game were Waymans two runs 
of 60 and 50 yards and Laboons line plunging. Weber 
was knocked unconscious during the first half and for 
a time or two after recovering gave the signals in a 
rather confused manner, but in the second half he 
was himself again and played his usual game. Bates 
and Sleeth starred for the Avalons, Bates scoring 
their only touchdown and both playing a good game. 
Sleeth was all that prevented Wayman reaching 
goal on his 60-yard run.

CAPT. DON WIMBERLY.
On the cover this week we have the picture of 
Captain Don Wimberly, of the Washington and Jef
ferson team, whom we meet tomorrow. His face 
is familiar to quite a few and his foot-ball record to 
more than a few. The W. and J. team under his 
leadership this season has enjoyed one of the most 
successful years in its history and he certainly can 
look with pride over the string of games played this 
season, marred as it is by only one bad score, that 
against Yale early in the season. W. and J. certainly 
has demonstrated that the one year residence rule 
is not fatal to foot-ball success, at least not this 
year in their case.
By this time the constitution committee of the 
Athletic Association will probably have completed 
its work and early next week the classes should have 
something definite to work on. This matter certainly 
has dragged along for a time sufficient to let even the 
most uninterested get some information on the sub
ject.
In the constitution itself the matters of representa
tion, payment of fees, governing boards, etc., will 
be taken up and as the rules on these matters have 
been the result of a couple of years experience and 
of advice from the Faculty Athletic Committee, there 
should be no trouble about settling them. But there 
are several other matters that have not been so well 
looked after heretofore, and it is up to us to get all 
the information we can on the subjects and come to 
our various class meetings prepared to fight our 
fight there and afterward hold our peace and abide 
by the decision of the majority.
One of these matters is the incurring of obligations 
by whom and in what amounts. Another is the 
system of election of team managers and last, but 
not least, the awarding of school letters. This last 
has been based on no particular system so far, and
while it has worked out in the main satisfactorily 
it can easily be seen that at no distant date there 
is liable to be a difference oij opinion as to what 
sports are to be recognized and what ones are to 
receive a smaller award.
As to the incurring of obligations; right at the 
present time ther is an opportunity for decision as 
to whether we will incur additional expense to give 
the basket-ball team a place to practice or whether 
we wish to forego that sport until at such a time 
as we have a gymnasium of our own to practice in. 
The same decision will have to be made relative to 
the hockey team at the same time. There would 
be no question of our duty to provide money for 
basket-ball, hockey and all the other sports that are 
losing ventures if we were not already so deeply in
volved financially. At the beginning of the season 
we had a large deficit which the foot-ball manage
ment has cut down quite considerably; but owing 
to the unfortunate outcome of our Athletic field, we 
are left in a bad plight at the end of the foot-ball 
season and no immediate prospects of any betterment.
The way we have been compelled to run our hockey 
and basket-ball teams they can not help being losing 
ventures, and unless some more advantageous ar
rangements can be made that have existed in the 
past, it would seem advisable to curtail their ex
penses to a minimum until such time as we find 
ourselves in better shape to shoulder their burden.
As yet there doesnt seem to have been any very 
unanimous response to the invitation to come and 
help remove the dressing rooms, score boards and
 other small impediments from the field. This must 
be done before next week and Mr. Pfouts has very 
kindly offered to be of any service possible to the 
boys in removing the smaller articles not covered 
by the removal contract. In view of his kindness 
the students should not be any less thoughtful of 
their own interests and a goodly number should 
report to either Mr. Pfouts or Mr. Leeds today and 
find out what is wanted and the amount of time it 
will take. There isnt very much to be done and 
fifteen or twenty strong men can easily do all that 
Is required without much effort on any ones part.
A DIFFICULT PROBLEM SOLVED.
It isnt often that we like to acknowledge our
selves beaten or that we have failed to perceive 
the most direct solution for any problem that may 
arise; but in our three years struggle to obtain an 
athletic field it seems we have overlooked the most 
logical, speedy and altogether desirable settlement 
of our difficulties.
Of course the plan we are going to suggest is in
complete as to the details. As yet the party upon 
whom we are suggesting that our favor be bestowed 
being still in ignorance of our purpose, however, 
we feel that the details may yet be worked out sat
isfactorily and the party of the first part in the 
uni-lateral contract proposed may be made to see

how altogether desirable our suggestion is. Most 
all of the larger schools have an inclosure for ath
letics generally spoken of as The Field, very few 
in fact stick to the almost obsolete name Park. A 
great many of these fields are known by the name 
of the donor or some other distinguished character. 
Thus we hear of Franklin Field, Ferry Field, and 
Marshall Field.
This last name, when we note the word play on 
the name of Chicagos late Merchant Prince and 
generous donor to the universities, athletic affairs 
at once suggests a solution so simple that we won
der we did not think of it before. Of course we do 
not care to follow precedent too closely and would 
prefer to establish it rather than follow here where 
conditions are so different from those obtaining at 
any other school, yet in this case we think that a 
bold plagerism of an idea would be a good thing, 
and when the opportunity exists among our own 
Faculty the desire to put the idea into execution 
becomes almost irresistable and we feel sure that 
we could become almost immediately accustomed 
to speaking of the Field as William P.
As we said before, we are not speaking exCathedra when we announce this settlement, and 
as we have intimated, Mr. Field is still in ignor
ance of >the honor awaiting; but we hope that can 
be arranged satisfactorily at an early date.

SNAPPY ARTICLE ON ATHLETICS.
The following is an extract of an article which re
cently appeared in full in the Harvard Bulletin, and 
the Associated Sunday Magazine (Inc.), who get out 
the Sunday supplements of the Boston Post, New 
York Tribune, Chicago Record-Herald, St. Louis 
Republic, Pittsburg Post, Philadelphia Press, Wash
ington Star, Minneapolis Journal, Rocky Mountain 
News and Denver Times. The author is Prof. L. B. 
R. Briggs, 75, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and 
Sciences of Harvard, and Chairman of their Com
mittee on the Regulation of Athletic Sports. Only 
a lack of space prevents its insertion as a whole, 
for it is one of the clearest articles on clean sport 
that has been seen for a long time. While some of 
our readers have undoubtedly seen it in its entirety, 
it is reprinted for the benefit of any who may have

ATHLETICS AND COLLEGE LOYALTY.
Good and Bad Poinlts of the Sports of American 
Undergraduates.
College loyalty is often ancestral, often traditional 
to this or that preparatory school; but for many 
young fellows it begins with the freshman year and 
with intercollegiate athletics. Sometimes it begins 
spontaneously in the enthusiasm of a new and larger 
life; sometimes it is pumped by artificial initiatory 
processes or by songs and mass meetings. The 
songs and the mass meetings satisfy the brass band 
instinct of youth and celebrate past and future ath
letic contests, wherein the university for conven
ience is treated as perennially invincible,some
times, at Harvard, in glaring defiance of the facts. 
When we consider how much of older peoples en
thusiasm for the opera or for philanthropy or for 
the horse show is nothing but fashion and persist
ency, we cannot wonder that college loyalty in its 
early stages is somewhat forced; yet with every 
allowance for traditional and co-operative emotion, 
and for a boys love of athletics, we cannot but won
der upon what meat it feeds that in one short month 
it has grown so great.
If the analogy -between foot-ball and war has its 
amusing side, it has its serious side also; for as in 
war all is fair, so to some minds all is fair in and 
about foot-ball,and not fair only, but essential to 
loyal service. Even in war honest people were at 
variance as to the ethics of General Funstons cap
ture of Aguinaldo; and in foot-ballwhich, after all,

---------------------------------------------------

TH E T A RT ANir
is not quite warethical questions are still more 
perplexing.
One thing, however, should not be forgotten. The 
great out-of-door games, foot-ball and base-ball, are 
strategic; and strategy is as much a part of them 
as of war or chess. Nothing could be unfairer than 
to inveigh against them as purely physical and brain
less games, yet to resent in them as dishonest the 
playing of wit against wit, of intellect against intel
lect, the strategy of the moment or of the long cal
culating hours. I have heard used against alleged 
trickery in athletics arguments that would prove it 
deceitful for a runner to dodge a man who tries to 
stop him; and since it would be even a worse wrong 
to run into an opponent, the opposed player, steer
ing between the deceptive and the brutal, has no 
refuge but a polite standstill. Doubtless there are 
still persons of intelligence who can prove that the 
honest pitcher throws a ball to be hit and not to be 
hit at,persons of intelligence, which, however, 
they have not applied to some forms of outdoor sport. 
Do these persons play chess?
In a recent intercollegiate game of foot-ball, an 
end who was not'lame limped to draw on himself 
the enemys attack and thus protect from attack 
his fellow end who had a bad knee. Of this bad 
knee, by the way, the opposing team was kept in 
ignorance through false reports to the press. For 
the false reports to the press nothing respectable 
can be said, and I dismiss them for the time being. 
The end rushs strategy, whether indigenous or 
planted in him by the coach, presents interesting 
questions of right and wrong.
When the Federation of Harvard Clubs, meeting 
to discuss grave university problems, receives with 
a burst of enthusiasm a foot-ball song, written and 
performed by a distinguished middle aged delegate 
the refrain of which is,
Pom tiddley om pom, pom tiddley om pom,
Pom tiddley om pom, pay,
when the Governor of New York leads the cheering 
between the halves of one game and later, as Presi
dent of the United States, sends a congratulatory 
telegram to the victors in another,it is not be
cause a few young fellows have carried a leather 
ball to a goal, or even because they have proved 
themselves active and strong and brave; it is be
cause at their time of life the position of that leather 
ball is the symbol of what means to them as much as 
anything else on earth, the success and the glory of 
the college that they love. To say that Yale or Har
vard is only trying to move a leathher ball is like 
saying that a standard bearer is only trying to grasp 
a stick with a piece of cloth on it. No man can 
comprehend collegiate sport who closes his eyes to 
symbolism and romance, to the bit of red ribbon 
that a man would die to win. Nor can any man 
comprehend youth who holds it to accounnt for com
mercial inaccuracies in things of the spirit.
To any one who watches athletics as a phase of
moral and intellectual as well as of physical life it 
becomes clear that the standards of coaches and 
trainers are accepted for better or for worse by the 
majority of boys and young men, and that with dis
tinguished exceptions these standards are low. 
Sometimes, indeed, they are disgustingly low. If 
you havent got the men, says an eminent trainer, 
damn it! get em! The same authority observes 
that ten years from now people will note by the score 
that the game was won; they will not remember 
how it was won. Even gentlemen have defended 
the publication of false bulletins in the daily papers. 
Smith is not out for practice; the country is wild 
with curiosity; the reporters are inquisitive and un
scrupulous,if they are not appeased they will 
roast the team and depress it. We cant afford 
to let Yale know that Smith has water on the knee; 
we must account for his absence; we will give Smith 
a slight injury in the shoulder.
The roasting comments of a disappointed and 
spiteful reporter are no more than a brave man 
might bear. If reading the newspapers in the foot
ball season were proclaimed a breach of training, 
the team would save some time and be spared to 
some degree from what President Eliot calls in
solent and vulgar comments on their personal qual
ities;- stuffing a reporter in order to make his 
comments soothing implies a pusillanimity which 
cannot but affect the moral fibre of the student 
body.
There is no need of multiplying instances to show 
the spirit and the standards of some coaches,the 
vileness of the language that they permit and em
ploy; the treachery of play that they instil for mo
ments when the officials are not looking. These are 
matters of common knowledge, and make some per
sons despair of the game. Whether it be for the 
free and public plying of a freshhman team with 
champagne, or for the deliberate adoption of curs
ing out as a part of sound policy, the coach is the 
element in foot-ball that needs closest scrutiny to
day. If his will is law and his spirit pervasive, it 
should follow that a right-minded gentleman with 
personal courage and with enough knowledge of the 
game to be respected as a teacher, has almost 
boundless power for good; and this I believe to be 
the fact. No preacher and no dean can do what a 
foot-ball coach can do in maintaining among stu
dents a clean, brave, sensitively honorable life. The 
reason is simple; he works in a field that young 
mengood or badinstinctively love, and his re
sults are seen and felt by thousands. If he teaches 
his players (forbidden by rule to use the fist) the art 
of using the end of the forearm with the hand 
turned back, he degrades not only them but the 
whole university and such other universities as are 
affected by his prestige; if he teaches his players to 
play hard and fearlessly, never inflicting a wanton 
injury, never slugging on the sly, never insulting 
an opponent to make him slug and get disqualified, 
never playing anything but a white game from 
start to finish, he lifts up the sportsmanship of his

college and, in some measure, of his country.
In questions of athletic honor, morals are inti
mately related to manners. After a faculty crusade 
against foot-ball, certain Harvard undergraduates 
produced a burlesque game, in which an opponent 
of the player who ran with the ball stopped at his 
approach, bowed, and exclaimed, After you! Foot
ball is not a parlor game; nor is base-ball. If a 
catcher, to intimidate a base runner and gain time 
for putting him out, guards the plate by standing 
in the direct line between it and third base, 1 do not 
blame the runner for keeping on, straight and hard. 
He has the right of way; it is the catchers busi
ness to give him a free road; and whether the 
catcher is run into or not, it is the catcher and not 
the runner who is no gentleman. In the matching 
strength with strength, some kinds of manners are 
out of place; yet, rightly considered, these games 
provide one of the finest and severest tests of minute 
and trained courtesy. As a believer in college ath
letics and a lover of base-ball, I admit that I am stag
gered by the exultantly unacademic appearance and 
bearing of many college nines. As to professional 
base-ball, the game has of late been played so much 
with the mouth that the newspapers are half jus
tified in calling the spectators an audience. I doubt 
whether a college player can do anything more ef
fective for his Alma Mater (outside of clean living) 
than by keeping quiet on the ball field and playing 
the game.
I need not say that these matters are of less mo
ment than what 1 have been discussing; that vul
garity is not dishonesty; that in base-ball and foot
ball the worst offences are not oral; and that a man 
may talk foolishly and even yell to disturb an op
posing pitcher, who would not trip or spike a runner 
or wittingly kick a halfback in the head. Those of 
us who love athletics know that we have much to 
explain and much to admit which we cannot ex
plain. We believe in the enforcement of strict 
rules; but we believe more firmly in.what would 
make strict rules needless if not insulting. Pardon 
a man who in the heat of play loses his temper, if 
he does not lose it too often; but ostracise a man 
who trips or slugs or knees another, or deliberately 
cultivates skill in holding an opponent, unseen. 
Why should the standard of athletics be lower than 
that of cards?
A recent writer tells of a New England minister 
to whom a committee of his flock complained that 
he had preached the same sermon three Sundays 
running, and that it was time for another. He an
swered, I fail to perceive that this one has as yet 
had any effect. I am aware that I have said noth
ing new; nor do I know anything new to be said.

There is in the purification of college athletics noble 
work for large-minded men,the purification, not 
the abolition. I doubt whether sounder doctrine 
was ever preached than that of President Roosevelt 
in his much abused and frequently garbled speech 
to the Harvard students (February, 1907). That 
also is not new; yet those persons who would feel 
the true relation of athletic sport to college loyalty 
and to lifewill do well to read it through.
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND FUTURE APPLI
CATION OF CENTRIFUGAL PUMPS.
D. S. Brown.
(Abstract of paper presented at Dayton meeting of 
Ohio Society Mechanical, Electrical and Steam En
gineers.)
The triumph of little things over the mighty can 
be shown throughout history in many notable exam
ples. Nearly 50 years ago a great hulk of a monster 
of the sea clad in heavy mail was checked in its ca
reer of destruction and put to rout by a tiny craft 
sarcastically dubbed a cheese box on a shingle. We 
can find a parallel example in the engineering world 
of the present day.
For a generation engineers have pointed with pride 
to the achievements of high-duty, water-works pumping-engines as being the best, examples in steam 
power efficiency, but to-day a tiny opponent has 
arisen to dispute their claims and establish a new 
mark in the engineering world. We all remember 
with what awe and fascination we have gazed on 
the great, triple-expansion, condensing, pumping-engines designed by such men as Leavitt and Allis, 
with their intricate mazes of polished parts moving 
with sedate precision and impressing one with a 
sense of irresistible power. What wonder then if 
we look with incredulity, if not contempt, on a small 
cylindrical affair with no moving valves, or visible 
rods and cranks, which we are told is a pump whose 
capacity equals that of the vast machine upon which 
we gaze with pride and awe.
But the world moves on, and its motion is rotative. 
So the engineering world is abandoning the reciproIf you wish a subscription to any engineering pub=

eating principle which has side-tracked steam en
gineering for a hundred years and is going back to 
the rotary type of over two thousand years ago. 
Just as surely as the steam turbine is destined to 
replace the reciprocating engine, the centrifugal 
pump will displace the reciprocating type for all 
purposes. Let us, therefore, look into this centrifu
gal pump proposition a little more closely.
We find that the centrifugal pump presents a 
problem concerning which there is a scarcity of pub
lished information. Probably no other machine in 
general use has less tabulated data regarding it in 
general circulation, and its design and the uses to 
which it may be put are more unknown to the ordi
nary engine. When your worthy secretary invited 
me to prepare this paper I set to work to accumu
late some of the published data on centrifugal pumps, 
and turned at to the Encyclopedia Americana, a set 
of which was at hand, I found the subject dismissed 
with a brief paragraph devoted mainly to centrifugal 
machines, the closing sentence informing me, Cream 
is now commonly separated from milk by the same 
method. See butter.
It may be wondered why a problem presenting so 
many interesting possibilities should have been so 
universally neglected. The reason, however, is 
doubtless due to the fact that the centrifugal pump, 
like the steam turbine, was abandoned in favor of a 
reciprocating machine before it had been thoroughly 
developed because the principles of its action were 
not clearly understood. In fact, even at the present 
time, when the subject has been given the careful 
thought and attention of many capable engineers, 
results or non-results obtained from using a centrif
ugal pump have baffled the inventor and user alike 
and brought them to the conclusion reached by John 
Richards in his essay on centrifugal pumps wherein 
he states, Theses pumps are a class of machines that 
defy the iriathematician and, as an old workman 
once remarked, have more tricks than a circus mule. 
Thus it will be seen that an unsatisfactory state of 
affairs has existed in that a technical subject has 
been dealt with more or less empyrically. However, 
it has now been put on a more theoretical basis.
Let us look for a moment at the work of the ear
lier experimenters with this type of machine, who 
have really paved the way for the present-day pump.
The centrifugal pump was used as early as the 
latter part of the seventeenth century for lifting 
liquids. Its gradual development is probably known 
to most engineers of the present day who have given 
the subject any thought. Dennis Papin, a famous 
French engineer, designed his Hessian Suck in 1703. 
It was a form of centrifugal pump embodying most 
of the features thought to be essential in the present 
day machine. I say thought to be essential be
cause a recent development with which I shall later 
deal has shown a new mechanical principle which 
has shown a radical departure from the conventional 
design. After Papin, the idea does not seem to 
have been further developed until 1818, when the 
Massachusetts pump was brought out. This was the

earliest prototype of the conventional centrifugal 
pump as it is now known. Since that time many 
improvements and changes have been made until to
day the centrifugal pump is a highly efficient ma
chine adapted for a thousand different uses in every 
phase of pumping work. This fact is apparently still 
not generally known. As recently as 1904 Mr. C. H. 
Innes, M. A., an English Professor of Engineering, 
published a Treatise on the Centrifugal Pump, es
pecially adapted for engineers, in which he makes 
this remarkable statement, The Centrifugal Pump 
is used for low lifts but it has been known to work 
economically with lifts as high as 98 feet. And yet 
pumps are built to-day for lifts up to 2,000 feet which 
show good efficiency.
Centrifugal pumps have already been brought to a 
point where they are serious rivals of reciprocating 
pumps in many fields and are their undoubted and 
unquestioned superiors in as many more. For in
stance where liquids containing even a small per
centage of grit are to be handled the reciprocating 
type with its close sliding contacts between moving 
and stationary parts is at a great disadvantage, and 
the centrifugal pump is not only more efficient, but 
more durable. In fact, the centrifugal pump was 
introduced into a crowded pump field by such phases 
as efficiency, durability and simplicity, long since 
grown hackneyed to the purchaser. Many times 
has he, lured by these enticing words, which seemed 
to open up that golden prospect where the steam 
pump ceased from troubling and the repair man 
was at rest, invested to his sorrow. Those circus 
mule tricks previously referred to have led him to 
prefer the leaky, pounding, rattling, inefficient steam 
pump, which at least gave him some water to the 
new machine, which usually balked at the critical 
moment. The business has passed that stage, how
ever, and the fact has been proven that the centrifu
gal really has the advantage claimed for it over the 
steam pump. It is certainly more efficient and even 
a cursory examination of its construction reveals the 
fact that it must be more durable, since it is cer
tainly simpler.
Even the most sanguine centrifugal pump manufac
turer will not deny that at present there are many 
places where the steam pump reigns supreme, all 
things being considered, and that the centrifugal is 
at a great disadvantage, but there are many more 
places where the centrifugal more than holds its 
own and is slowly but surely encroaching on the 
steam pumps stronghold and gradually forcing it to 
the limbo of forgotten things.

I trust that the Society will pardon me if at vari
ous points in this paper I draw more or ess on my 
own experience for concrete illustrations, but it will 
be realized that they are ones I am most familiar 
with, and consequently better able to discuss.
Most engineers are familiar with the big dredging 
pumps now in use for handling enormous quantities 
of sand and mud. No more economical form of 
handling can be conceived. From 25 to 40% sand is 
moved with ease, and continuously, and little power 
is used in proportion to the work accomplished. The 
pumps occupy little space and, comparatively speak
ing, their weight is small. They are generally lined 
with steel in the form of liners that can be quickly 
and easily replaced, thus giving them a long life, 
their tremendous suction power also enables them 
to work easily in fairly deep water.
in taking care of sewage also the centrifugal 
pump holds a firm place. The pump can be sub
merged in the sewage with shaft extending above to 
couple direct, or by gear, to an electric motor or 
steam engine. These pumps are generally designed 
to work automatically when electrically driven, the 
motor being started and stopped through the action 
of a fioat-switch governed, by a float in the pump-well. 
This eliminates the attendant necessary where a 
steam pump is used, cuttting down the maintenance 
cost, and it makes the most economical unit procur
able, since the outfit runs only just when if. is needed 
and stops on the instant that its work has been per
formed. Such an outfit, which may be taken as a 
representative one, has been installed by the Dayton 
Hydraulic Machinery Company for the city of Day
ton in a pumping station built for the purpose which 
has been in successful operation now for over a year. 
The installation consists of two vertical submerged 
eight-inch pumps having a combined capacity of 
5,000 gallons of sewage per minute. These pumps 
are located at the bottom of a well 22 feet deep in 
which the sewage and back water from the river is 
collected. They are driven through bevel gears by 
Westinghouse horizontal induction motors. They 
discharge through a manifold directly into the river. 
The pumps are automatically governed by a float 
actuating a hydraulic starter, which works abso
lutely automatically, no attendant being maintained 
at the station. This hydraulic starter is a most in
genious one for operating with the alternating cur
rent, and has given excellent results. The equip
ment forms a very representative municipal installa
tion.
