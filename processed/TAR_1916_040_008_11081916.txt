LAWTOCHFRARIE BEGINS 
WORK FOR THE YEAR
Plebes to beAddressedTime 
and Placs of Meetings Se
lected
The Lawtochfrarie Society held its 
first meeting of the year last Thurs
day with all of the ten members pres
ent. The society was organized and 
plans formed for the coming year. Of 
these plans the first is to give the 
plebS class some idea of the alms 
and purposes of this Sophomore so
ciety, and for that reason E. H. Pafenbach was selected to address their 
class.
Regular meetings of the society are 
to be held every two weeks on Thurs
day evenings at 7:30. A place of meet
ing has been difficult to decide upon, 
but the present arrangement is to 
have those ^embers of the society 
who belong to the different fraterni
ties invite the society to their fratern
ity houses for meetings. In this way 
the society hopes to have a meeting 
place which will be not only central, 
but also effective in bringing the so
ciety to the attention of the rest of 
the school.

ATHLETIC CAREER OF 
MARSHALL SPECTACULAR
Phil Marshall, the man who 
scored tho touchdown against Cornoll 
last Saturday, and who played such 
a wonderful defensive game, is loday 
a hero In Techs athletic history 
The spectacular athletic career of 
Phil Marshall began five years ago, 
whon Peabody High' school launched 
Its first football team. Phil played a 
fast game from the start, fighting 
shoulder to shoulder with the now 
famous stars, McLaren and Hllty of 
the Pill, .cloven. At. Peabody. Mar

The light Carnegie Tech team held the Big Red Team of Cor
nell to the score of 15-7 last Saturday in one of the most gruelling 
battles ever witnessed on the Ithacans gridiron. The game was featured with end runs by 8111111.7 Kesner and off-tackle plays by the 
Cornell baqkfiold, both of which plays netted long gains. The most 
spectacular play of the game was the 33-yard run by Phil Marshall 
in the third quarter, through a broken field, in which he dodged
and twisted through almost the entire Cornell team for Techs
touchdown, which made the tie score of 7-7.
* Judging from the score, 15-7, one 
would say that Carnegie held Cornell 
to a low score. And so they did, but 
at 001 time in the game could an eye
witness believe that Tech was trying 
to hold Cornell to a low score. They 
wore fighting every inch of tho way 
and every bit as aggrosslvoly as tho 
Cornell eleven. In tho first few min
utes of play thoy swept tho Ithacans 
off their feet, and whon thoy awoko 
the ball was 100 their four yard line. 
The field was soggy from a steady 
downpour or rain, which made It hard 
for tho backs to liandlo the ball with 
any groat ease. Owing to this tho 
Pittsburgh grldddrs wore unable to 
got away I heir forward passes, 100 
which they, placed Ibolr chances ol 
long gains against tho much heavier

leadership won for him the captaincy 
of the basketball and track teams, 
both of which teams made splendid 
records under Ills leadership.
When Phil entered Tech, Coach 
Steffen was quick to discover In him 
a football player of unusual merit. 
In his first game for Tech ho caught 
a Grovo City klckoff and ran the 
length of the field for a touchdown. 
Since that time he has been a consist
ent ground gainer in nearly every 
game. Last year at Case I01 played 
one of the most remarkablo games of 
his career. Tech and Case wore fight

scored, when Phil Intercepted a for

CARNEGIE CLAN AT BORDER.
The true Tech. spirit lias again 
shown Itself to be in evidence, even 
under the most unusual circumstances, 
In the fact that about thirty Tech 
men doing duty on the border in the 
Eighteenth regiment have formed an
other Carnegie Tech Clan. Announce
ment was made at one of the regi
ment assemblies that all Carnegie 
Tech men were requested to meet. As 
a result of this meeting about thirty 
Tech men turned out, and later a ban
quet was held at one of the leading 
hotels in El Paso. We can hardly 
say enough to praise these men for 
this evidence of that true loyalty to 
the alma mater, which goes  so far 
toward making Tech a great institu
tion.

small number of non-fraternity men 
supporting the Prom, in former years.
PLEBES HOLD PARTY FOR 
UPPER CLASSMENAT DORM
Saturday evening, October 28th, the 
Morewood dormitory was cleverly 
decorated with weird lights, and a 
Halloween spirit filled the downstairs 
rooms. It had become the haunt of 
ghosts, fearful white creatures,, who 
worked their magic charms on the 
older spirits who had gathered at the 
dormitory on past Hallowe'ens.
When the ghosts unmasked familiar 
faces were recognized. The older 
girls were then entertained in vari
ous ways. Eacli one was served with 
a piece of magic cake containing a 
prophecy for the future. Helen Hollman is the possessbr of a new pet, a 
very black, wiggley cat, which she 
won for eating her pumpkin pie fast
er than anyone else. Lulu Fuller and 
Betty Haye also won prizes. After 
having their fortunes told in many 
ways, and being introduced to King 
and Queen Hinky-Dink (some of them 
fell for it), they went to the dining 
room and were served with cider, 
doughnuts, candy and popcorn.
SOPHOMORE AND PLEBE.
Certain events during the past few 
days have again agitated the question 
of Plebe regulation versus Sophomore 
hazing. This same question has been 
one which far older schools than Tech 
have been facing for yoars, and which 
Is still unsolved, The question seems 
to be, just how far Is the sophomore 
justified In Imposing certain restric
tions upon the Plebe? Just to what 
degree is he justified In practicing 
what is known as "hazing?" Wo cant 
answer those questions. Oldor and 
wiser heads have struggled with the 
problem, but we wish to vonturo a 
few opinions.
Personal Injury to the Plebe must 
be avoided; destruction of apparel, 
etc., Is not; in accordance with the 
qualities ol! a well organized Institu
tion; the Ill-treating of the Freshman 
by his older schoolmates Is dying out 
In all schools. Those facts are cer
tain; But on the other hand the Plebe 
mus(; be taught to realize that he 
should respect the oldor men. Im
pertinence from a Plebe cannot bo 
tolerated, unless the whole tradition 
of college life Is to be sacrificed. In 
every walk of life one Is taught to re
spect seniority, and it should be so 
in college. We are sure that faculty 
and students agree upon these funda.mental principles. The mistakes of 
the past have not shown any marked 
differences in the general attitude of 
the student and the faculty, merely 
disagreement in details. How can 
these disagreements be settled once 
and for all? Surely a settlement 
would he better than a repetition of 
wrangling each year.
In our opinion a well organized stu
dent government is the only solution. 
Yes, Tech has student government, 
hut how? Each of the mens schools 
have their own organization, with the 
exception of the Science school, which 
lacks any definite form of government. 
The Design School has its Senate; the 
Industries its Assembly; the M. M. 
C, S. also has a Senate; but. what of 
the Science School? They have only 
class president^, none of whom really 
know what their duties are. The 
classes have no rules, laws, Cohsti 
tutions, precedents, nor anything of 
the sorthow In the world can Intel 
ligont action bo oxpoctod of tlielr pres
idents V It Is Impossible on the face 
of it. And this Is where the whole 
trouble of Plebe regulation lies. Each 
class and each school in no way com
bined, cannot and liefer will bo able 
to act systematically and Intelligently.
Therefore, we suggest; to those in
dividuals who are at present being 
caused so much trouble with this 
question of Plebe regulation, that they 
investigate the possibilities of a syi 
tem of student government having 
representation in each school which 
can act upon such questions as Plebe 
regulation. Such a body, composed 
of the leaders of the school, will be 
able to adjust the details in which

a Junior Class when the Junior Prom, 
became an annual event, at Tech, and 
while In rocont yoars It has boon roprpsontod on the committee, the chair
man has always boon olioson from the 
Science School. Because of the grow
ing Importance of I ho Doslgn School 
Its Junior Class felt that It Is deserv
ing of greater recognition in this re
spect, and has roquostod of the 
Science School the chulrmunship in 
alternate yoars. The participation of 
non-fraternity men In former Promon-. 
ados has been very small, and to 
remedy this condition and give them 
the representation to which they are 
entitled, a change was necessary. 
Also the experience of previous com
mittees has demonstrated the advisibility of fewer men on the commit
tee.
The Proposition 
In furtherance of tlie plan for con
solidating and unifying the interests 
of the Schools of Applied Science and 
Applied Design of the Carnegie Insti
tute of Technology, the proposition is 
presented to the Junior Class of the 
School of Applied Science to estab
lish as a precedent, that is recom
mended to be observed by all future 
Junior Classes of the above mention
ed Schools, the following in regard to 
the Junior Promenade.
Be it agreed: That the chairman of 
the Junior Promenade Committee be 
alternately chosen in successive years 
by' the respective Junior President, 
from the Junior Class of the School 
of Applied Science and the School of 
Applied Design.
That the president of the Junior 
Class of the School other than the one 
from which the chairman of the com
mittee is chosen, load the Promenade, 
Also to put the committee on a move 
ofilelont working basis as has been 
shown desirable by the experience of 
previous committees; bo It agreed: 
That the committee be restricted 
to seven men, chosen pro-rata from 
the Junior Classes of the two Schools, 
by the two presidents in consultation; 
and that the committee be made up 
pro-rata of Fraternity and non-Fraternity men.
This movement is a distinct ad
vance in the handling of the prepara
tions for the Junior Prom, and be
comes especially important at this 
time as a result of the increasing num

MR. FITZGERALD TALKS TO SCIENCE PLEBES
In the absence of Professor Allan
II. Willett on last Thursday, J. AnderBon Fitzgerald, instructor in com
mercial practice and statistics, lec
tured to the Plebes of the School of 
Applied Science upon "Workmen's 
Compensation Laws." 1-Ie outlined 
the hazards of modern industry, stat
ed that German statistics for twenty 
years proved that one-half of their In
dustrial accidents were the fault of 
neither employer nor employe, and 
that the theory underlying compensa
tion legislation was that the cost of 
the product should Include compensa
tion for injured labor as well as for 
spoiled material. He discussed the 
hardships which the old liability laws 
placed upon both employer and em
ploye, pointed out the constitutional 
and practical difficulties in the way 
of compensation acts, and showed how 
the thirty-one states which have adopt
ed such laws since 1910 have Iried 
to solve them.
SCIENCE DEBATING 
CLUB MEETING
A debating society is being organ
ized at Science School, Thursday, No
vember 9, at 4:30, men interested in 
debating practice will meet in Room
111 to discuss plans for the club's ac

Several Science students have ex
pressed their desire to supplement 
the Plebe debating course and to 
maintain public speaking practice. The 
debating club will organize for this 
purpose, and debates and discussions 
will be so arranged that all members 
will have frequent practice in argu
mentation.
The faculty of the Department of 
English have unanimously expressed 
their approval of the plan. Prof. 
Doyle said: "I will give you all possi
ble assistance," when a student asked 
liiiri for an opinion.
Membership is not restricted to any 
class, all men interested in debating 
are requested to meet in Room 111,

and the first score of the game, which 
started the Tech rally.
In last Saturdays game, Charley 
Barrett, Cornell's All-American quar
terback on last years team, said of 
Phils 33 yard run for a touchdown: 
"I thought Marshall would be downed 
in his tracks before getting started. 
His run was very clever and deserves 
great credit.
The Sophomore class in the Sci
ence school last year also recognized 
his merit as a leader, and elected him 
class president.
AT THE STRAND
Barney Bernard in A Prince in a 
Pawnshop is the Strand attraction 
Wednesday; a picture that for well 
balanced contrast between humor and 
pathos is said to be far above the 
average production. Mr. Bernard orig
inated the character of Abe Potash in 
Potash and Perlmutter, and those 
who saw him in that production need 
not be told of his ability as a charac
ter actor.

Lash, a unique drama telling of a 
custom of whipping at the post any 
woman of a small Breton settlement 
who loses her respectability. Miss 
Doro, through the double dealing of 
a society woman, comes under the 
lash and metes out like punishment 
to her tormentor. The scenes of the 
ocean are nothing short of marvelous. 
Earle Williams, in the third of the 
Scarlet Runner series, will also be 
shown Thursday.
Gail Kane, in "The Scarlet Oath, 
in which Miss Kane plays a dual role, 
is the attraction Friday. The produc
tion has received most flattering press 
notices, and has a plot of continued 
interest.
Saturday, Valeska Suratt, of a type 
of beauty that is entirely different, is 
starred in The Straight Way. In 
this production Miss Suratt is the vic
tim of circumstances, and placed in 
a most unhappy position. She deter
mines on revenge and the conse
quences of her planning nearly brings 
ruin to one whom she loves best. It 
is a Fox production.
Monday, Lionel Barrymore, in The 
Brand of Cowardice, a Metro wonderPlay, is shown, a drama of the Mex
ican border and of one who shunned 
the call of duty, only to be forced to 
the front, there to show that his met
tle after all. was true steel. It is an 
exciting picture, sure to please. One 
of the scenes shows the burning of a 
town, and in it some of the magnifi
cent settings for Metros Romeo and 
Juliet were destroyed to make the 
scene.
Tuesday, Blanche-Sweet, with Theo

is presented in The Storm, a play

PLAID ELEVEN HOLDS
CORNELLS HEAVY TEAM
TO LOW SCORE OF 15-7
(Continued From Page One.) 
Wrights three punts totaled 132 yards 
while five for Benedict netted only 
163 yards. That Cornell did not 
plunge through the Plaid line at will 
is shown by the fact that five times 
the Cornell backs were thrown for 
losses netting 20 yards against four 
.times with a total of 13 yards for 
Tech.
The stars for Tech were undoubt
edly Kesner and Marshall. To Kes
ner for his long gains around the ends, 
coupled with the good generalship he 
used in running the team as a whole, 
is due the greatest credit for the 
Plaids good showing at Ithaca. But 
aside from this the wily left-lialfback, 
Phil Marshall, looms up as one of the 
higgest men on the team. Time and 
again he was depended on to make 
the few yards necessary for a first 
down or a snappy end run. His clev
erness in dodging tacklers, as shown 
in the third quarter when he got 
away for a run of 33 yards for a 
touchdown, was lauded by everyone 
in the Cornell bleachers. On the de
fense, Marshall was a tower of 
strength, doing far more than his 
share of the work. Time and again 
he was one of the first men down on 
punts.
Altdoerfer played a strong game at
fullback, but was unable to bear too 
much of the burden on account of his 
injured arm. He played the entire 
game, however, and his line plunges 
in the earlier part of the game were 
a source of great worry to the Cornell 
aggregation. Finlay, as Well as the 
rest of the Plaid backfield, played the 
entire time, and his manner of picking 
holes was a credit to any backfielder.
Wright's work, both at end and 
punting, far outshadowing that of Ben
edict for Cornell, was praised every
where on the campus. Very few plays 
were sent around his end during the 
entire game. With three years ahead 
the prospects for a great football 
career loom up big for this lad from 
Lakewood.
Before the game started Cornell 
backers were reluctant to predict the 
outcome of the game, saying that the 
Cornell team was weak from loss of 
several veterans, and that their big
gest bet, Shiverick, would not play, 
due to injuries. But when Shiverick 
went in during the , last half, he 
showed little signs of an injured man 
when he plunged through the line at 
will. The second string men used by 
Coach Sharpe showed up well and 
speak for great power in the future.
The Tech line stood the gaff of their 
much heavier opponents well until 
near the closing stages, when the 
great weight handicap, coupled with 
the soggy field, began to tell.
The game in detail:
Cornell won the toss and elected to 
receive the kiclcoff.
First Quarter.
Wright kicked to Mueller on the
7, Mueller carried the ball back to the 
22, Benedict forced himself through 
left tackle for 3 yards but lost 2 in 
the same place on the next play. 
Speed got 1 yard at left tackle. Ben
edict dropped back to punt.
Finlay received the pigskin and ran 
it back 13 yards to the 40. Kesner 
skirted left end for 9 yards. On a 
right end run Kesner was thrown for 
a 1 yard loss. Altdoerfer went 
through the line for 7 yards and con
sequently first down on the 47. Alt
doerfer hit center for 3, Marshal ran 
up 5 more through right guard. Kes
ner with a wide swoop and good inter
ference, carried the ball to the 18 
yard. line. Marshall got 1 at right 
guard, Finlay added another through 
left tackle, Kesner failed to gain any
thing at right end.
Cornell was offside on the next play 
and the ball was put in play on the
10 yard line. Marshall hit left tackle 
for 3, Finlay was held _ for no gain 
through the line.
Marshall made 1 yard through 
the line, leaving the ball on the
4 yard line with fourth down.
Kesner tried a forward pass to 
Wright but Benedict broke it up.
On a fake punt from behind the 
goal line Speed made first down on 
our 16 yard line. Hoffman failed to 
gain at left tackle, Speed was forced 
out of bounds on a right end run after 
making four yards. At this time it 
was raining hard, which made it dif
ficult to handle the ball. Benedict 
was tackled for a 4 yard loss and so 
on the next play dropped back to 
punt.

DR. SCOTT TELLS ASSEM 
ELY ABOUT EFFICIENCY
Four Means of Securing Effi
ciency Outlined to Science 
Men in General Lecture
Dr. Scott, head of the new Bureau 
of Salesmanship Research) last week 
addressed the Science Assembly on 
Efficiency. According to Dr. Scott 
there are few points to bo considered 
In any system of business efficiency. 
Two of these standardization and sys
tematizationare already well recog
nized, and may be typified by the Ford 
plant in Detroit. The third point re
quires that the workers he kept in a 
mood of pleasure, rather than fear Or 
displeasure. It Is well known that the 
condition of the. body is Interlocked 
with the condition of the mind; for ex
ample, on1s food refuses to digest if he 
is worried. Latest scientific research 
shows that this Is carried to such an 
extent that the composition of the 
blood varies with one's mood. There
fore if a man is to do his best work, 
he must he kept free from worry and 
fear. The fourth requirement for ef
ficiency is to have the workmen inter
ested in their work. Owing to chang
ing conditions in American homes in 
the last decade, the American youth 
cannot be made to work. When he 
works he does so because he is inter
ested, and the best way to keep him 
interested is to place responsibility 
upon him. These four points give, in 
short, Dr. Scott's recommendations 
for efficiency. His talk was enjoyed 
not Only because its subject matter 
was particularly applicable to the 
Science men, but also because his 
stories and examples were far from 
dry.
FIRST LECTURE ON 
HISTORY OF SCIENCE
On Monday afternoon, October 30, 
Dr. Libby gave the first of six lec
tures on the History of Science, for 
the benefit of the faculty and public. 
Those who attended seemed unani
mous in the opinion that the import
ance of Dr. Libbys subject, and his 
qualifications to speak upon it, merit
ed a larger audience than were able 
to hoar him in tills introductory lec
ture in room 102 of the Design School.
After relating how ho lilmself first 
became interested In the History of 
Science, Dr. Libby told interesting an
ecdotes of Ills experiences during Ills 
study at Oxford last year; the effect 
of the war on Oxford; the general lack 
ol! interest in the History of Science 
In England, due to the attitude of the 
public schools there toward science; 
the somewhat moro prominent place 
glvonto such study in Germany, and 
the beginnings of Instruction In this 
Hold In our own countrythose 
formod an Introduction to a brief 
statomont of somo of the benefits to 
be dorlvod from a knowlodgo of the 
development of scientific thought.
The moro Important of those bene
fits mentioned by Dr. Libby were the 
folldwlng:
1. Wo shall understand more thor
oughly the science of today if wo 
know its origins.
2. The history of science shows 
that we are engaged in the pursuit of 
truth, and that the past has not been 
infallible.
3. It shows the relations between 
the various sciences we are studying.
4. It introduces the student to the 
essential features of our civilization.
5. It shows the origin of science in 
industry and human needs.
0. It helps to break down caste.
7. Since science is international, 
the study of its history promotes in
ternationalism.
Dr. Libby said little specifically 
about the need for the study of the 
History of Science at Carnegie Insti
tute of Technology, but it seems ob
vious that the above arguments in 
favor of it apply with even greater 
force in an institution like our own, 
where we are daily studying and ap
plying science.
Dr. Libbys second lecture on the 
relation of the History of Science to 
democratic culture will be reviewed 
in the next issue of The Tartan. A 
full schedule of liis lectures will be 
found elsewhere In this issue.
ASST. SECY TAFT SPEAKS 
ATINDUSTBIFS ASSEMBLY
Assistant. Secretary Taft gavo an 
informal talk In assembly last 
wook. While Mr. Taft is not. a Toch 
Alumnus his talk proved that he had 
plenty of Tech spirit.
Last; wook Assembly was very poor
ly attended, only a small part of the 
middle class and about half of the 
other classes being preesnt. If this 
condition continues to exist it will re 
suit either in Assembly being abol
ished or roll call being taken.
This week Assembly will be held in 
the morning at 10:30 instead of 12:30.
ZETA LAMBDA EPSILON 
GIVES ANNUAL AFFAIR
------J--------
The Zeta Lambda Epsilon fraternity 
held its annual Hallowe'en masquer
ade on Tuesday evening, October 31,

appropriately decorated with autumn

toons of the fraternity colors. Cider,

orchestra. 
The guests of honor were: Prof.

THE Turkish Cigarette
That Murads are
Better than many 
25 cent cigarettes
is NOT a mere claim.
Murads ARE betterbecause better, higher-priced tobacco 
goes into Murads.
Much of the tobacco used in many 25 CENT cigarettes 
could never get into the Murad brand. These facts are 
perfectly well known among cigarette manufacturers.
