Beginning with the second

Tuesday Vote Sought
Besides having tiie polls open in 
Skibo, Margaret - Morrison, and

1:45 on Tuesday, a special poll 
will be open in Skibo from 11:30

allow those students with no Tues

one of the major reasons why 
there were a small percentage 
voting in former elections.

they will sponsor a few candidates

started the record sale in Skibo 
during the lunch periods. The 
book store is also stocked with al

chased there at any time.
No Spirit?
Judging from the number of 
disks already sold and ordered, it 
appears certain that an additional 
quantity of the attractive albums 
will have to be ordered to fill the 
demand. Friday will be the last 
day of the Skibo sale, but after 
the holidays the book store will 
still have a supply of albums.
In addition to selling records, 
the bandsmen are busily preparing 
for a conceit to be presented in
the Carnegie Music Hall on Jan
uary 20. Since the termination of 
their marching activities the con
cert band members have met three 
times per week, and consequently 
only the finishing touches need 
now be applied to their concert 
selections.
Instruments Added 
The addition of jeveral French 
horns and trombones to their 
complement has made it possible 
for the Kilties to perform such 
works as 1812 Overture by 
Tschaikovsky and Strauss ever

EditorialDear Santa
While were writing to Santa this week, well 
certainly ask for two tickets for Carnegie theater 
productions. We are convinced it is the only way 
to get them.
The drama department has produced sev
eral unusual plays during the last year, and, 
we are told, produced them in a very skill
ful manner. However, we always seem to be 
too late to get tickets or because of classes 
cannot get to the drama office at all when 
tickets are being distributed.
Many students have found themselves in sim
ilar positions, and thereby have missed all, or 
almost all, of the plays. Some students, on the 
other hand, are able to be present when the 
tickets are distributed and are fortunate to see 
every production.
We suggest a quota system be arranged where
by every student is guaranteed a seat for at least 
one performance or at least a restriction placed 
on the number of plays a student can attend.
On The Air
Since the FCC has given permission for CIT 
students to operate a radio station on campus, 
we hope the opportunity will find some energetic 
takers. This may not be as hard to find, how
ever, as reliable equipment and operating space 
lor the new station, WRCT.
The gains to be derived from such a 
campus activity warrant the utmost in aid 
from both Student Council and the adminis
tration. With this aid we are confident the 
students can produce programs that will be 
entertaining, informative, and profitable to

Easy, SportWhoops!
Will you be home for Christmas?
Its a good question because every year many 
college students looking forward to a joyous 
holiday never reach their destination because 
of highway accidents. In December last year, 
there were more highway accident deaths in pro
portion to the number of miles driven in any 
other month.
Because of the large number of Carnegie 
students who will drive home at the end of this 
week, we feel it is worth while to look at a 
few driving statistics.
In winter, hazards in driving are increased. * 
It takes 21 feet to stop a car going 20 miles an 
hour on a dry concrete pavement. The car will 
go nine times that far, or 183 feet, before stop
ping if the street is icy.
A lot of unsafe driving is only careless
ness. Its a little forgetfulness here, a little 
negligence there, or a little obliviousness 
somewhere else. But the forgetfulness, neg
ligence, an obliviousness may cost someone 
his lifeand the someone may be you.
Make this a Merry Christmas for everyone. 
You can do it by putting forth more effort than 
usual as you leave Pittsburgh in a car for the 
vacation. Obey signs, consider the other fellow 
and what he is going to do, use good driving 
manners, and drive within the speed limit . . . 
and well see you back next year.

Editor, the Tartan:
A person can appreciate many things when 
single and over twenty-one, most of which I 
agree with. However, when you misplaced my 
photo rom its correct statement in the Inquir

quainted could infer that I was married and 
would appreciate a competent baby sitter. This, 
I cannot agree with.
Being a student of printing administration, I 
am sympathetic to the error, as I believe you will 
be to my request that a correction be made in a 
subsequent issue of the Tartan. This will enable 
Evert Skoglund, married, to find his competent 
baby sitter and also give myself more oppor

A Solution
Editor, the Tartan:
When Tech students hold a total of ten rallies 
during the football season and at least three of 
them are dismal flops, then it is time that some
thing specific be done. This committee has come 
up with what should be a workable plan, and 
last week Student Council adopted it by unani
mous vote. This letter is to explain the purpose 
and implications of the plan.
The idea behind rallies, of course, is to increase 
spirit. CFPs rally before the Lehigh game was 
successful, as was the one before the Bethany 
game which was sponsored by the class organi
zation committee. But there is such a thing as 
having too many rallies; then some of them are 
flops, and spirit js weakened rather than strength
ened. The send-off before the Case game (spon
sored by the cheerleaders) and Student Councils 
celebration in Skibo three weeks ago are evi
dence of this fact.
We felt that one campus group should plan for 
the maximum number of successful rallies each 
year. Student Council is the logical group to 
make such a plan, and the social chairman has 
been delegated to carry it through. His new du
ties are to coordinate pre-game football rallies by
a. determining, with Councils approval, the 
number and type of rallies to be held dur
ing the football season;
b. presenting to council for approval the peti
tion of any organization which desires to 
sponsor one of the rallies.
if. as the season progresses, more or fewer ral
lies seem desirable, the social chairman may 
modify the plan to suit the situation.

A Solution To Rally Problem
Action Taken To Make Cut Safe For IMs;
APO Seeks Permanent Decorations Control
Councilmen hope they have found a remedy to cure the lack of 
school spirit shown by the small attendance and interest at the pre
game football rallies by expanding the duties of the social chairman 
to include the planning of more timely and lively pep meetings.
The large number of injuries ?
incurred on the cut during intra
mural football games this fall 
prompted Council to write a let
ter to the administration request
ing an investigation into the pos
sibility of regrading and redraining the cut. Plans and programs 
committee chairman Charles 
Koester presented a proposal by 
APO asking for permission to 
handle all permanent decorations.
Technical On Spot 
Running from a profit of $200 
to a loss of $200 in two issues is 
a bad policy for a magazine, sd 
budget chairman Art Zuch has 
called a conference with the Tech
nical business manager to see 
what must be corrected. Mr. Zuch 
also disclosed that $30 has been 
spent by Council for the promo
tion of class reorganization, and 
now only four dollars remain in 
the miscellaneous fund.
. Councils social chairman now 
is required to choose certain dates 
possible for pep rallies and to ob
tain approval from the football 
captain and senior cheerleader so 
that there will be no conflict. 
Next, he must find an organiza
tion that will sponsor the rally 
and attempt to present an inter
esting program.
Injuries Prompt Letter 
In the hope of removing the 
safety hazards caused by the con
crete surface drains of the Forbes 
street end of the cut by possibly 
installing several sub-soil drains, 
Council and several intramural 
groups sent letters to Dr. Miner. 
The unevenness of the grade and 
the many ridges and pockets also 
present prompted the suggestion 
that it also be regarded.
APO requested that it be given 
the task of dispensing, maintain
ing, and checking the equipment 
stored in Councils permanent 
decorations room. Council, how
ever, will retain the right to ap
prove the use of it and pay for 
new material. Previously, each 
organization rented the equip
ment, paid Council a small fee, 
and paid an operator for setting it 
up and operating it.

Sacred Music Planned 
By Mendelssohn Choir
On Tuesday evening, December 
20, at Carnegie Music hall, the 
Mendelssohn Choir will present 
its thirty-first annual concert fea
turing Handels Messiah.
Comprised entirely of - trained 
and experienced singers from all 
parts of the Pittsburgh district, 
and as far away as Greensburg 
and Beaver, the Mendelssohn 
Choir has presented many great 
choral works during the fortytwo years of its existence. How
ever, it is best known for its year
ly performances of the Messiah, 
at Christmas time.
Dr. Ernest Lunt, founder and 
still conductor of the choir, is 
recognized throughout the coun
try as an authority on oratorio. 
Not only have most of the finest 
church soloists of Pittsburgh sung 
in Mendelssohn Choir, at one time 
or another, but also many organ
ists and directors of church music 
have become members for a period 
of several years, in order to mas
ter the rigid traditions govern
ing music such as the-Messiah.

Plaid Five Meets Bethany Tomorrow
Correction
An error in last weeks Tar
tan listed Iowa State as a future 
basketball opponent of the Plaid 
varsity. Carnegie will meet State 
University of Iowa, member of 
the Big Ten, at Iowa City on 
December 23.
Everything human seems to be now babbling over with 
the old Yuletide spirit. It appears only fitting and proper that 
we should lend our voices to those of the throngs and give 
dear old Saint Nick a few hints on what some of the people 
in the locality might enjoy finding in their stockings on Christ
mas morning.
Starting down the alphabet for no good reason at all, we 
come to the name of Dr. Edward B. Baker, who*certainly has 
been good to Carnegie football fans. Theres no question that 
the Doctor would appreciate a triple threat T-formation quar
terback, two first rate tackles, a never failing place kicker, 
and a hulking, powerful fullback among other things.
From a team that had acquired very little in the past three 
years except a mania for losing football games, he molded a winner 
for the Tartans this year. With top notch material the sky would 
be the limit.
To Dr. Baker then, come next September may you echo 
the words of Notre Dames great vmentor, Frank Leahy, with 
Things look black. I havent found a capable fourth line 
center yet.
Next in line is Frank M. Cratsley, the man taking the place 
of Dr. Baker in the hearts of Plaid fans for the moment. Al
ways a favorite here since the beginning of his playing days, 
lie has indicated that he will fulfill all the hopes of his most 
ardent followers as a coach.
To the local basketball tutor we'll wish the first winning sea
son since the glorious days of 1938. For future reference it should 
be-added that capable replacements for seniors Mike Theodore, 
Joe Matsey. Jack Riehl. and Tasso Katselas would be greatly ap
preciated.
Guy Ilalferty becomes the next to receive our attention. 
The fiery track and cross country coach has had trouble put
ting together a winning season due more to the lack of ex
perience in his proteges than anything else. It seems that 
every time a star appears, he disappears almost as soon. Bill 
Johnson, Eddie Minnich, and Jackie Alberts, to mention a few, 
filled out one season of competition and then left for other 
pastures.
It's apparent that what our Mr. Halferty needs is a lull 
team that can stay around for a few years in tact and, inci
dentally, some additional power in the field events for next 
April.
To tennis coach Frank W. Moses well try to send along a few 
sound candidates who can fill out his team into a well balanced 
outfit. The intramural program may have already provided part 
of the gift.
The veteran coach andphysical education instructor has 
ju-t recently returned to his post after a serious illness and 
in this respect we hope he receives a long streak of good 
health.
Following down the list we arrive at Pat OConnor, whose 
soccer team broke even in eight contests this past autumn. It 
.seems his needs are largely those of replacing his goalies, both 
of whom graduate. To this we might add a large increase in 
well deserved student support for his team.
There's not much we can ask Santa to bring for athletic di
rector, Clarence Buddy Overend. He has had such phenomenal 
success in his relationship with other schools that the best we can 
do is send him many years of the same. And as an afterthought, 
well throw in a few first class golfers for next Spring.
For Dave See, it seems that some more space to harbor 
his rapidly increasing intramural program is first on the list. 
Practically single handed he has welded together an exten
sive system of athletic recreation and now is campaigning for 
better conditions under which to carry out his plans.
Secondly, he could use some official recognition of a wrest
ling team which has proved itself to be of fine calibre in in
formal competition.
Last, but far from least, comes suimming coach Claude Sofield, 
to whom well wish another Dave Luckey, several classy divers, 
nd the material sufficient to allow him a well balanced squad.
With the current season rapidly approaching, a victorious 
year might be in order as a request. A brief look at the com
petition lined up shows that this would be quite a feat for any 
crew to accomplish.
And now to each and every one of you, we'll send along 
a very Merry Christmas and the happiest of New Years.

Carnegie Five Loses 
To Waynesburg, 55-52
Defeat Is First Of Season For Plaid;
Tartan Lead Overcome By Jackets
By Frank Carter
Getting off to a slow start, the Waynesburg-Carnegie Tech bas
ketball game wound up with the Waynesburg Yellowjackets com
ing out on top of a 55-52 score.
Mike Theodore, the Tartan captain, held Kamarkovich, Waynesburgs leading player, scoreless^-----------------------------------------------------

teams in their last outing.
Appearing rather sluggish in their two home appearances thus 
far, the Plaid quintet seems to improve with the oppisition. Their
-----------------------------------------------------?most brilliant performances to
j date were staged in their upset 
victory over Lawrence and a three 
point defeat at the hands of 
Waynesburg.
The powerful Bisons marched 
over Rio Grande, 87-44; Transyl
vania, 81-48; and Muskingum, 76- 
71, before bowing to a heavily 
favored West Virginia five by a 
62-60 score last Friday at Mor
gantown.
Coach Glenn A. Johnsons green 
and white team, coming here in 
search of revenge for the gridiron 
defeat they suffered at the hands 
of the locals last September, 
downed Carnegie by a 66-61 score 
last year.
Big Guns Misfire
To date the Tartan defense has 
been more than adequate against 
high scoring opponents holding 
Lawrence Techs Jim Stepler 
scoreless and Waynesburgs Chuck 
Kamarkovich to nine points.
The Bethany lineup, however, 
offers the biggest challenge the 
local defense has faced. Big Jim 
Mewhirter has tossed through 90
throughout the first half. The 
game, played before a capacity 
crowd at the Waynesburg gym, 
had an extremely tight atmos
phere throughout the first quarter.
The first score came after 2:20 
minutes when Joe Matsey tipped 
one in for two points. Jack Riehl 
cut in on a pass from Theodore 
and made the second Skibo bas
ket. After a time-out, the Yellow
jackets dropped in a foul shot and 
a basket to tighten the game up 
at 4-3. The Tartans bounced back 
when Theodore scored on a one 
hander from the side. Stough put 
through a foul shot for Waynes
burg and finished the quarter with 
a small 6-4 score in favor of 
Carnegie.
Pace Quickens
At the beginning of the second 
quarter, Waynesburg tied it up 
with an easy layup shot. Len 
Bianchi then dropped in a onehanded push shot for two more 
for the Tartans. After three min
utes, the game picked up as both 
teams began to take more shots. 
On a series of one handed and 
set shots by both teams, the half 
ended with a. 15-15 score.
The second half found a pepped 
up Waynesburg team getting the 
first lour markers on a pivot by 
Stough and a one hapder by Mans
field. Tommy Beck came back 
with a push shot for the Tartans.
Gjurich put in two quick bas
kets on a pivot and a layup, with 
Staycer going all the way in on 
a layup and scoring two more 
points. At this time the Plaids 
also picked up with Riehl putting 
in seven points and the quarter 
finished at 3.5-33, Waynesburg.
Tartans Take Lead
Len Bianchi tied it up at 35-35 
with a quick basket to get the 
fourth quarter rolling. The Tar
tans led by seven points soon after 
the beginning of the quarter, but 
with 3 minutes left the Yellow
jackets were ahead by six points.
The Tartans made their last bid 
when behind by eight points and 
one minute to go as a basket by 
McCullugh and two foul shots by 
Katselas and Riehl made the score 
54-48 Waynesburg. With 45 sec
onds left Tom Craig stole the ball 
and turned it into two points and 
Tom Beck sunk a long set from 
mid-court making it 54 - 52 
Waynesburg. With 26 seconds left 
Stough of Waynesburg made a 
foul shot, making the final score 
of 55-52.
Forty To Seek 
IM Wrestling 
Championships
The final matches for the IM 
wrestling championships will be 
held Wednesday afternoon in 
Thistle hall. A hotly-contested 
series of preliminary matches 
started Monday, and will continue 
today, the first starting at 4:30 
p. m.
Of over 40 entries from the var
ious campus organizations, Bob 
Horsch, Jim Semple, and George 
Hawkins, the three Tech wrestlers 
who carried tht Plaid team to a 
victory over Pitt last week, are 
the favorites in their respective 
weight classes. Gus Mavrigian, 
Arthur Marston, Bob Pratt, and 
Paul Davies have made good 
showings at practice, ana are the 
most probable winners in the oth
er weight classes.
Coach C. G. Alexander stated 
that arrangements were being 
made for six matches to be held 
between a team of Plaid wrestlers 
and members of the AAU of 
Greater Pittsburgh. The local has 
received invitations from Case 
Tech IM teams, and from the 
Waynesburg College JV teams for 
future matches.
JIM MEWHIRTER
points for a 22.5 average to lead
the parade while diminutive 5 foot
4 inch Edgar Martin has totaled
81 points and a 20.3 average at 
theother forward.
Guard Don Harris boasts a 12 
point average, while Mt. Lebanons 
Curt Thomas at center and Johnny
Vujnovic at the opposite guard
round out the first five and the
scoring.
10 Point Advantage
The team as a whole has com
piled a 76 point game average 
against 66.5 established by Car
negie. Last years Tartan five av
eraged 52.4 points per game while 
their opponents amassed 58.6. 
Prior to last years loss, Carnegie 
ran up nine straight victories 
without a defeat against the West 
Virginians starting back in 1911.
Westminster visits the Scots on 
Saturday with two victories under 
their belt. Their latest, an 88-54 
conquest of Alderson - Broaddus 
last Saturday, was their 61st con
secutive victory on their home 
floor.
Tall Don McCullugh, who tal
lied 17 points against AldersonBroaddus, figures to lead the vis
itors in the scoring column.

Better Playing Field 
Sought By IM Board
At their meeting of December 6, the Intramural Board approved 
and forwarded a letter to Dr. Douglas F. Miner requesting action 
to improve playing conditions on the athletic fields situated on the
cut. ?----------------1-----------------------------------
Despite the rising sentiment re
garding the matter, the Boards 
letter was the first written request 
to be placed in the hands of the 
school authorities. Both Dr. O.
Grant Reed, school physician, and 
Mr. David A. See, supervisor of 
intramural athletics, have voiced 
concern over the current situation.
Tartans
Breaking Even
Inexperienced JVs 
Shoiv Improvement
Injuries Prevalent
Several injuries resulting from 
these conditions in the recent 
touch football season have caused 
renewed agitation for improve
ments on the part of concerned 
parties. It is believed that both 
the Student Council and the Coun
cil of Fraternity Presidents will 
soon join the campaign to alter 
matters.
The text of the Boards letter, 
composed by Joe Zaffuto, John 
Bishop, and Bill Wettach, follows:
The purpose of this letter is to 
bring to your attention the hazard
ous condition of the athletic field 
on the cut. Many complaints 
have been received by the Intra
mural Board regarding this sit
uation.
Ruts, Holes, Bumps
The surface of the playing field 
is covered with such irregularities 
as ruts, holes, bumps, iron plates, 
etc., which endanger the physical 
welfare of the players. For ex
ample, in the touch football sport 
alone there have been 3 or 4 ser
ious injuries and, in addition, 
numerous minor accidents this 
semester.
We feel that reconditioning and 
maintaining the field would be of 
great benefit to the intramural 
sports program.

Coed Volleyball 
Game Tomorrow
The WAA Voleyball club has 
tentatively scheduled a coed game 
for Wednesday at 4:30 p. m. This 
game promises to be more exciting 
than last week^s game when the 
freshmen defeated the upper
classmen, 51-15.

Working on the theory that 
large oaks from little acorns 
grow, the Tartans have resumed 
J.V. basketball after a layoff of 
one season. The little Tartans 
will play a complete schedule of 
games as curtain raisers for the 
varsity.
The JVs are coached by Marty 
Chetlin, a figure well known to 
followers of the Tartan court 
game during the past few years. 
His team so far has shown the ef
fects of its .inexperience. They lost 
their opening game to St. James 
high school by a lopsided mar
gin but rebounded to a 36-35 vic
tory over St. Justin last week.
Most of the members of the 
team have not had previous high 
school experience. This of course 
provides coach Chetlin with his 
major source of trouble. In addi
tion, three of his proteges with 
varsity high school background 
became ineligible at midsemester. 
It is possible, however, that they 
will return to action at the end of 
the semester.
All this of course paints a 
slightly dismal picture. However, 
the JVs have looked better each 
time out and should keep getting 
better with additional experience. 
As unfair as it is to judge a book 
by its cover, it is equally unfair to 
look with pessimism on a venture 
as young as this is.
If the little Tartans can con 
tribute one or two men to next 
years varsity, they will be more 
than worth their weight in basket
balls.

sium, was closely contested for 
three quarters. However, the Tar
tans reserve strength finally tam
ed the scrappy Bearcats and pav
ed the way for a 23-point final 
period scoring onslaught.
Riehl Leads Scoring
Jack Riehl, Carnegie guard, 
notched 12 points to lead the Plaid 
scorers, and played brilliant bas
ketball both offensively and de
fensively. Freshman forward Tom 
Craig, a great competitor, collect
ed 10 points and performed like 
a seasoned college veteran.
High scoring honors for the 
game, however, went to the Bear
cats star center, Frank Gaffney, 
who meshed 13 markers with his 
one-hand push shots from both 
the field and the foul line.
Although St. Vincents rough, 
close-guarding type of play ham
pered the home team considera
bly, the Tartans held the lead 
throughout the game. However, 
the Plaid floormen showed poor 
passing in the first half and miss
ed several excellent scoring op
portunities.
Quick Lead
Captain Mike Theodore opened 
the scoring in the game with a 
looping one-hand shot from the 
left of the foul circle. Dick O'Neill 
added a foul and then tipped-in 
two consecutive rebounds of miss
ed fouls by Tom Craig.
Craig took over at this point 
and netted two fielders and two 
fouls, Len Bianchi made a free 
throw to give the Tartans a 14-9 
edge at the end of the quarter.
Carnegie Coach Mel Cratsley in
serted a new team at the begin
ning of the second period, and the 
Bearcats promptly cut the home 
teams advantage to 19-18. Bob 
McCullough then took command, 
sinking two layup shots on wellexecuted plays.
Only 5 Points
The two teams matched a field 
goal and afoul during the re
mainder ^of the quarter, the hali 
ending with Carnegie ahead, 26-21.
Field goals by Riehl and Mc
Cullough and a foul by Craig, all 
in the first minute of the third 
period, increased the Plaids ad
vantage to ten points. The Bearcasts came roaring back to reduce 
the lead near the end of the stan
za, however, with Gaffneys two 
fielders and two free throws mak
ing the count read 38-33.
Joe Matseys three fast goals, 
coupled with two fielders by Hil
ary Holste, gave Carnegie a 15- 
point margin in the early minutes 
of the final quarter. Midway 
through the period the visitors 
again began to shorten the 
distance, chiefly through some 
fine work by guard Sam Paola.
However, Riehl proved to be 
equal to the occasion, hitting the 
cords with two goals from the field 
and one from the foul line to put 
the game out of reach of the rap
idly tiring Bearcats.
