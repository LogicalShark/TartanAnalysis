BOARD OF (OfflOE
AMENDMENTS TO CONSTITU
TION PASSED.
HAVERFORD NOSES OUI.
VARSITY GIVES EASTERNERS RUN FOR VICTORY.
The regular meeting of the Board 
of Control of the Athletic Association 
held last Wednesday evening was a 
very important one. The report of 
the committee on letters and sweat
ers, in the form of amendments to 
the constitution was accepted. A new 
feature will be instituted this year of 
awarding a four and one-half inch 
block C. A. A. to the men who 
compete in intercollegiate contests 
but do not earn the Varsity C. The 
requirements for letters in track and 
tennis have been changed and a new 
style of insignia for the minor sports 
decided upon. The complete report 
of the committee follows:
That football, baseball and track 
athletics be recognized as major 
sports.
That basketball, tennis, and hockey, 
be recognized as minor sports.
That Section 3, Article XI be 
changed to read: To each member
of the Varsity Track Team winning 
eight points during the season in duel 
or invitation meets, or any place in 
an inter-collegiate meet, or first, sec
ond or third place in the Penn Relays; 
or to any man establishing a new As
sociation record, a letter shall be 
awarded. An inter-collegiate meet 
shall be interpreted to mean one open 
to all colleges, and not an invitation 
meet. The Executive Committee to 
be judge of same.
That Section 6, Article XI. be 
changed to read: To each member of
the Varsity Tennis Team winning 
first or second place in an inter-col
legiate meet, or two matches in single 
or doubles in dual meet, a letter shall 
be awarded.
That Section 8, Article XI, be

ters shall consist of the regulation six 
inch block C, a copy of which shall 
be kept on record by the secretary.

letters shall consist of the regulation 
four and one-half inch block C ex
cept when having won an inter-collegiate championship as interpreted by 
the Executive Committee, in which 
case the regulation six inch C shall 
be awarded.
That Section 10 be added to Article 
XI, to read: The football team shall
wear the regulation maroon-coiored 
sweater.

Playing under the most favorable 
conditions that have marked a foot
ball game this year, the Varsity lost 
a plucky up-hill struggle to Haverford last Saturday by the score of 10 
to 6. After playing the greater part 
of the first half without an excess of 
fighting spirit, the Plaid warriors 
canre back in the third and fourth 
periods and literally played the visi
tors off their feet. That the final 
score was not in our favor by at least 
two points was partly nothing but 
hard luck, and partly the result of 
short flashes of poor generalship. On 
two successive occasions, with the ball 
within Haverfords 15-yard line, for
ward passes were attempted on the 
third and fourth downs and failed.
From the grandstand the game was 
ideal in that it repeatedly caused heart 
paralysis, mental aberrations and sus
pension of the faculties of the vocal 
cords. The bright day brought out 
a good representation of fair rooters, 
but, outside of their escorts, there 
were few members of the male sex. 
In fact, as at former games, the small 
number of students attending seems 
to indicate that Carnegie Tech as a 
whole has little or no interest in either 
their team or the sport. Those who 
neglected to be present should feel dis
graced as well as having missed some
thing that was worth more than the 
effort required to see it.
Haverford scored first on a field 
goal near the end of the first period. 
Haverford kicked off to Tech, Balsinger catching the ball and passing 
it to Kreider, the two running it back 
to the 47-yard line. Oefinger and Balsinger each made 3 yards, then the 
former was held without gaining. A 
forward pass, Kesner to Fagan, pur 
the ball on Haverfords 35-vard line, 
with a 12-yard gain. Oefinger added
5 yards and Kesner made 10, then 
Clair attempted to drop-kick a field 
goal from the 32-yard line, but failed.
The ball was brought out to the 20- 
yard line and given to Haverford. 
They made one first down, then were 
forced to kick. Carey did the punting 
and Kesner returned the ball 5 years 
to mid-field. A fumble, after 8 yards 
had been gained, was recovered by 
Haverford on their 40-yard line. Ram
sey gained 5 yards, then Carey broke 
through between tackle and end for 
a 20-yard run. Hammering at the 
line, Ramsey made first down on three 
tries. Tech was set 5 yards nearer 
their goal with a penalty for off-side 
play. Carey made 1 yard, but HellMcUOliE ElEflED 
(AMEORNEXI TEAR
strorn got Ramsey for no gain. On 
a criss-cross, Shipley gained 7 yards, 
but Kreider, on the next play, set 
Ramsey back a yard. Ramsey tried 
again and broke through center for 3 
yards. A forward pass was incom
plete, and on the fourth down, Carey 
drop-kicked the ball over the bar from 
the 18-yard line. Score: Haverford 3 
Tech 0.
Kindi went in for Fagan and Clair 
kicked off. Martwick returned the 
ball to his 28-yard line. Driving over 
Techs line-men, the big Haverford 
backs made first down on three tries. 
Tech braced and forced Ramsey to 
punt. Kesner caught the ball and ran 
it back 14 yards to the 35 mark. Oef
inger made 13 yards on two tries be
fore the whistle ended the period. 
Score: Haverford, 3; Tech, 0.
The second quarter started with 
Techs ball on the 48-yard line, but a 
fumble gave the leather to Haverford 
in mid-field. A forward pass, Carey 
to Shipley, gained 20 yards. Ham
mering at the line, the Haverford 
backs drove the Tech defense back 
to the 10-yard line. Then a belated 
brace set the attack back four yards 
on three tries, and Carey attempted 
a field goal. His drop-kick was start
ed from the 18-yard line but went 
wide.
Tech was held on the 25-yard line 
and Clair punted. Carey ran back 13 
yards to his 43-yard line. Then the 
Haverford attack battered again at 
the line, making five successive first 
downs. Tyler replaced Hellstrom, and 
Trautman went in for Kindi. With 
the ball on the five-yard line, Carey 
gained a yard, then Ramsey broke 
over the line for a touchdown. Ram
sey kicked the goal from placement, 
making the score 10 to 0.
After Clairs kick-off, Haverford 
was forced to punt. McDonald, who 
had replaced Kesner, ran the ball back
10 yards, then a poor pass caused Balsinger to fumble and Haverford took 
the ball on Techs 23-yard line. Carey 
attempted a field goal but failed as the 
half ended.
Both teams started the second half 
with their original line-ups. Soon af
ter the start, Clair punted from mid
field, and the ball went behind the 
goal line for a touchback. Neither side 
could gain, and an exchange of punts 
kept the ball out of danger. Then 
on a fake play, starting from kick for
mation, Kreider and Clair fooled the 
visitors and the former ran to HaverContinued on Page 5
FOOTBALL MEN SELECT 
LEADER AT BANQUET.
At the banquet, which marked the 
close of the training season for the 
members of the football squad the 
men of the Varsity chose W. Frank 
McCaughey, Design, 15, for their cap
tain next year.
McCaughey has finished his third 
season as a member of Carnegie Tech 
football teams. During two of these 
years he played on the line, usually 
at guard, but this season he was used 
at fullback in every game but the last, 
when he appeared at his old position 
of guard. His playing needs no com
ment, as anyone who witnessed the 
Haverford game last week can realize. 
His aggressiveness and strength make 
him an object for fear on the part of 
opponents. With ex-Capt. Clair on 
the other side of the line, Tech had 
two guards as nearly ideal as could 
be wished.
The banquet, which was held on 
Saturday evening at the Schenley, 
was the annual event tendered to the 
varsity and the scrubs by the manage
ment. The invited guests included 
Coaches Marks and Cozens, Director 
of Athletics McCulloch, Assistant 
Manager Davis, Second Assistants 
Henning and Rownd, and Trainer 
Fred Kelly. Manager Haaren acted 
as toastmaster, calling upon these 
celebrites for short speeches: Capt. 
Clair and Capt.-elect McCaughey, also 
established reputations as postpran
dial speakers. Tommy Malie, mascot 
offered several pleasing songs as his 
contribution to an evening filled with 
good-fellowship and pleasure.
The Tartan wishes to congratulate 
Captain Clair and his team on the sea
son just finished and to wish Captainelect McCaughey success and victory 
for his team of the season of 1914

PITTSBURGH, PA., NOV. 26, 1913
THE SUPER-DEVELOPMENT OF 
THE ATHLETIC IDEAL.
We quote an extract from the edi
torial columns of one of our contem
poraries:
In these days of broad education 
and of the super-development of the 
athletic ideal the team is not known 
to fame as representing the college so 
much as the college shines in promi
nence as its team is successful. The 
record of the team is being taken 
more and more as the outward symbol 
of progressiveness, spirit, unity, activ
ity, of the college as a whole and the 
sanity of mind and soundness of body 
of the student body. ... It is only 
one method of advertising, but it is 
a good one. ...
This amazing view of athletics is 
perhaps to be expected from a few 
colleges or universities in America, 
but we are glad to say that it is not 
the general rule. Every right-think
ing man knows that Yale, Harvard, 
or Princeton, although they have had 
famous football teams, would not base 
their claims to greatness as universi
ties upon the success of their teams. 
Such a statement could only have 
arisen from a small college, which 
cannot expect to attract students by 
its scholastic and equipment advan
tages, and, needing some sort of ad
vertisement, turns to athletics, notably 
football, as its salvation. It is* to 
be deplored, however, that such an 
erroneous impression of the purpose 
of American colleges is thus given to 
anyone who happens to read the col
lege publication.
Let it be understood that we do not
discount the advantages of athletics 
to the physical well-being of the par
ticipants. But the school that makes 
athletics the chief item in its curri
culum is riding fast toward failure as 
an American institution of learning. 
It is folly to assert that a winning 
football-team of eleven men is indica
tive of the sanity of mind and sound
ness of body of the entire studentbody.
Our team has not always won this 
year. On the other hand, they have 
fought hard and valiently, and we are 
proud of them. We do not need a 
winning team to advertise our insti
tution and to demonstrate our sanity; 
we only want our teams to represent 
in their battles the true Carnegie 
spirit of squareness, pluck and perse
verance. This they have shown dur
ing the past season, and while possibly 
our student body may be insane 
because the football team was not al
ways a winning one, nevertheless we 
hope that athletics at Carnegie will 
continue on the same honest basis 
that it has in the past.
The following poem has been re
ceived by The Tartan, and we are 
glad to publish it because of the deep 
sympathy shown therein in the late 
loss of the schools.
In Memory of Dean Hewlett. 
Over our hearts falls bereavement, 
The light of his presence has fled, 
With love and with reverence griev
ing,
Deep sorrow has bowed every head.
With love and with anguish were 
mourning 
The man who was teacher and friend, 
Whose sympathy, counsel and wisdom 
Led on to the noblest end.
He showed us the high fine endeaver, 
The worth of all labor well done, 
The courage and patience and striv
ing,
The goal of nobility won.
And yet while in grief, were lament
ing
The loss of this life pure and strong, 
Our deep heart a message doth echo 
That rings like a triumphant song!
He gave us the fine inspiration 
Of all that a good life can hold,
The light of his soul shines upon us 
Afar from the City of Gold.
From across the Divide comes the 
message,
We hear the enheartening refrain
It calls us to new exaltation 
That speaks through our loss and our 
pain:
The message of all that he taught us. 
The song of a soul that is pure
It bids us to serve as he served us,
To labor and love and endure!

FRATERNITY CONFERENCE.
The recent movement to establish 
a fraternity rushing system at Lafay
ette is a good one. The average fra
ternity man views, with a good deal 
of relief, the close of the rushing sea
son. Night after night, during the 
past few weeks, he has spent in the 
company of new men, making him
self agreeable as circumstances will 
permit him and persuading them into 
the belief that Alpha Omega chapter 
of Pi Xi fraternity will be the sine qua 
non in his college life.
It is reasonable to believe that a 
postponement of the rushing season 
to a later period in the college year 
will be a great advantage to all fra
ternities here at Lafayette. In other 
colleges a goat night has been rec
ognized, when late in the year all 
fraternities make their selections. This 
plan obviates the hurried and indis
criminate scramble for men which an
nually occurs at Lafayette.
If a regulated rushing and pledging 
system were established here by con
certed action of all the fraternities, 
the risk of being deceived in the selec
tion of new men would be averted 
while the candidates for the grip and 
pin would see more clearly with the 
elapse of time which fraternity would 
best suit their inclinations.
The Daily Kansan of November 3, 
contains a story explaining how that 
21 to 7 defeat registered by Oklahoma 
happened to occur. There are a va
riety of reasons set forth, but the sum 
total seems to be that Kansas ran 
up against an eleven that was her 
superior.
At Wisconsin a freshman is to be 
ducked before the entire school for 
disobeying the freshman green cap 
rule. The students council has ap
pointed a ducking committee and the 
ducking will take place publicly. This 
one man was the only freshman to 
violate the rule.
Cornell University has a new rule 
barring freshman from using auto
mobiles on the campus.

CROSS-COUNTRY TEAM PICKED
Men to Represent Tech in Crafton 
Meet Thanksgiving.
Last Wednesday afternoon a tryout 
was held, to select a team. The course 
was a very difficult one, over the hills 
and valleys of Schenley Park. Quite 
a squad reported and the followingtwo teams were picked:
1st Team'Hazelton, Capt., Mac
Millan, Dunseith, Handelman, Wal
ker, A. J., Campbell.
2nd TeamBruno, Reist, Moore, 
Barnes.
Both teams will compete. Hazeltons time for the seven miles was 
forty minutes and forty-five seconds.
The management of Track Team 
wishes to thank all those who helped 
make the tryout a success.
THISTLE BOARD MEETS.
The third meeting of the Thistle 
Board was held on last Thursday 
evening. The board decided to adopt 
the book of last year as a standard, 
and consequently to have this years 
edition of the same size and style of 
binding as was used last year. The 
contract for engraving was awarded 
to the Reliance Engraving Co., of 
Pittsburgh. It is expected to place 
the contract for the photographs 
within the next ;ew weeks in order 
that the pictures of the various clubs, 
classes, and students may be taken 
immediately after the Christmas Va
cation. The Thistle receipts are on 
sale in the various schools and it is 
hoped that as many students as pos
sible will get their subscriptions in 
early, as it will be of great assistance 
to the Board if they will do so.
CROSS-COUNTRY RACE 
TOMORROW.
Tomorrow morning, the second an
nual cross-country race under the au
spices of the Crafton Athletic Asso
ciation will be held. It will be run 
over the six mile course at Crafton, 
starting promptly at 11 oclock. Prizes 
will be given to the first four men to 
finish and a team prize will be award
ed the school or organization having 
the lowest score. Every place will 
count a certain number of points, 
commencing at one for the winner, 
and the total scores of the first four 
men that finish for each team will 
be considered.
Tech will enter two teams, which 
have been chosen as a result of last 
weeks tryout. The first one will con-- 
sist of Capt. Haselton, McMillan, 
Dunseith, Handelman, Walker and 
Campbell; and the second of Reist, 
Moore, Brunot and Barnes. Several 
runners from out of town have en
tered the race with the hope of estab
lishing their supremacy over the con
testants in this district. The competi
tion, therefore, promises to be as keen 
as it has been in the past.
MUSICAL CLUBS ENJOY 
COUNTRY TRIP.
On Friday last at 5 P. M. the Musi
cal Clubs, forty strong, boarded a But
ler short line special car at Penn and 
Federal streets and traveled to Wild
wood. Here the clubs were met by 
two hay rigs which proceeded back 
into the interior for a mile to the Pine 
Creek Presbyterian Church. By the 
time the caravan reached its destina
tion it would be well to state that the 
men could have eaten hard tack and 
would have called it good. Happily, 
the management had arranged for a 
feed and it was a feed long to be re
memberedtwo kinds of chicken 
(Get me!), Roast beef, mashed pota
toes, cold slaw, cranberry sauce, apri
cot sauce, honey, tea, coffee or cocoa, 
and four kinds of pieapple, mince, 
raisin or pumpkin. Now this was a 
dinner fit for a king and was well 
taken care of by all the meii Some 
of the boys who were anxious io start 
the concert got up from the table and 
forgot their pie, but the manager as
sured them that the audience would 
be glad to wait until every man had 
his fill.
The concert was started at 8 oclock 
sharp with a good sized and apprecia
tive audience of 200, although this 
was the initial concert of the club, the 
music was rendered exceptionally 
well. Particular mention might be 
made of a solo rendered by Mr. Merker, O Perfect Day, which was well 
received. Mr. Merker has a baritone 
voice of excellent quality and fine 
range. The trio, Steffler, Steffler and 
Wood, with stringed instruments, 
made a very good impression.
After the concert the boys were 
treated to ice cream and cake and a 
general talkfest followed.
The caravan started at 11:30 and 
the special car met the club at Wild
wood. bringing the men to the city at 
12:15 A. M.
The next concert will be at the City 
Poor Farm, Marshalsea, on Friday 
night, December 5. Announcement 
will be made iater, giving schedule of 
cars. On account of the delay in 
starting last Friday, the management 
wants the men to understand that this 
was unavoidable and the time of start
ing will be given on the minute, so 
that the men can have plenty of time.

CARNEGIE CHORAL CLUB.
The Carnegie Choral Club has be
gun its work for the year 1913-1914. 
The first meeting was held Wednes
day, November 12, at 4 oclock in the 
Assembly Hall of M. M. C. S. About 
fifty members were present. The first 
action was in the form of an informal 
reception, at which the different mem
bers of the club were made acquaint
ed with each other.
The club was formed with the idea 
of having an organization of trained 
singers who would be able to take part 
at any occasions which might come up. 
It is composed of students from all 
four schools. Any one who can carry a 
tune is eligible to membership. It is 
the earnest desire of the Director and

December 1, of the one-act comedy 
drama, Beauty Is Only Skin Deep. 
This is William A. Bradys maiden 
dip into the two-a-day. The playlet 
is from the pen of Elizabeth Jordan 
and is a condensation of her highly 
successful comedy, The Lady from 
Oklahoma. Marion Littlefield and 
her Florentine Singers will sustain 
the music interest of next weeks bill. 
They are an octette gathered from the 
grand operas and their program is 
about the most pretentious musical 
offering in the annals of vaudeville. 
Miss Littlefield has a glorious con
tralto voice and amidst a specially 
attractive scenic setting she and her 
associates will sing such melodious 
favorites as Schumanns Traumerai, 
the Miserere from Verdis 111 
Trovatore, the trio from Faust, the 
sextet from Lucia, the quartet from 
Rigoletto and a variety of folk 
songs. Of course, there will be other 
features, all of the Davis quality.
WEDDING ANNOUNCEMENT.
On Tuesday, November 18th, Miss 
L. Leole Reno, of Oneida street, City,

ens. Both the bride and bridegroom 
are well known at Tech.
For the past five years Miss Reno 
has been a member of the office staff 
of the administration, filling the posi
tion of Recorder, School of Applied 
Industries. Mr. Stevens pursued a 
course last year, in the Night School 
of Applied Industries. Both have at
tended most of the Tech social func
tions during the past three years. 
Heartiest congratulations!
ENGAGEMENT ANNOUNCED.
During the past week the news
papers had an announcement of an 
engagement of interest to members 
of the faculty and the student body. 
It reads as follows: Announcement

will be an event of the very near 
future.
Miss Marcus has been connected 
with the Schools almost from their 
beginning, for the most part of the 
time in the capacity of private secre
tary to Dean Connelley. The best 
wishes of her many friends have greet
ed the announcement.
DRAFTSMEN MEETING.
An important meeting of the Drafts
man Club, School of Applied Indus

Haverford Noses Out
Continued :from Page' 1 
fords 35 line for a 15-yard gain. Both 
men were knocked out, but revived 
and resumed play. Kesner made 10 
yards and Oefinger added 2. Kesner 
again got around end for a pretty run 
of 19 yards. A fumble'lost four yards 
for Tech, and Kesner was thrown for 
another 3-yard loss, putting the ball
11 .yards from the goal. Haverford 
was penalized half the distance for 
holding, and Tech given first down. 
Still the Tech attack lacked the punch 
and 12 yards were lost 0*11 .3 downs. 
A forward pass, Kreider to Fagan was 
successful but failed to make distance 
and Haverford took the ball on their 
10-yard line.
Carey kicked and Tech started to 
run the ball back. Oefinger gained 
consistently and the period ended with 
the ball on Haverfords 30-yard line.
Oefinger bucked his way through 
center for 20 yards, then made 3 more. 
Kesner failed and two forward passes 
were incomplete, the ball being given 
to Haverford on their 20-yard line. 
Haverford gained 8 yards on three 
tries then punted, Kesner returned 15 
yards to Techs 48 mark. On a double 
pass, McDonald put the ball on Haverfords 18-yard line. Oefinger cut 
the distance by five yards, then Krei
der made the mistake of trying two 
forward passes in succession, and 
these being incomplete, Haverford 
took the ball on downs on their 15- 
yard line. . . .
Ramsey punted, and Kreider ran
back 10 yards to Haverfords 40 mark. 
Oefingr broke through to the 13-yard 
line and Balsinger hit the line -for 11 
of these. Oefinger was sent over for 
the touchdown. Clairs punt-out was 
.poor and the score stood at 10 to 6.
The remainder of the game was oc
cupied by - short gains and exchanged 
kicks, ending with the ball in Haver
fords possession on their 35-yard 
line.
The most prominent feature of the 
game was the playing of Oefinger. 
He never failed to gain when given 
the ball and picked his holes unerring
ly. He was aided, as were the other 
backs, by superb interference and 
team-play by the line-men. Balsinger 
shone on defense, and the running of 
the midgets, Kreider, Kesner and Mc
Donald surprised the Haverford bunch 
with the speed.
Fulmer, Clair, McCaughey and 
Welch played hard both on defense 
and offense. Fa^an; so^pick that he 
could hardly stand, played more Ag
gressively than some of "the well men, 
especially in the first half. Hellstrom 
played better than in any previous 
game, justifying his choice by the 
coaches. His work on defense, when 
he moved from center to guard, was 
brilliant at times.
Haverford deserves great credit for 
the first part of the game, when it 
looked as if they would roll up a big 
score, but in the last quarter they gave 
a poor exhibition of stalling. Ramsey 
and Martwick were the most consist
ent gainers and Carey handled his

MHO CLUB MEETING.
At the second monthly meeting of 
the Mho Club held Wednesday even
ing, November the 19th, in Room 104 
Machinery Hall, the proposed consti
tutional amendment making the of
fices of secretary and treasurer sep
arate was passed. G. C. Minor was 
elected secretary, while R. E. Dunbar 
remained treasurer.
The Manufacture of Carbon Brush
es was the subject of the speaker of 
the evening, L. R. Madison, chairman 
of the program committee. His in
teresting talk was based largely on 
experience, for he has worked at this 
occupation.
Professor Dennison, faculty advisor 
for the club, spoke reviewing the pre
vious talk and urging that all mem
bers of the electrical classes attend 
the meetings of the local branch of 
the American Institute of Electrical 
Engineers, and, if practicable, become 
student members. For three dollars 
a year a student may join the Insti
tute as a student member. This en
titles him' to a copy of the Proceed
ings, which includes the speeches 
made at the annual meeting and all 
business transacted. After three 
years, however, the student must 
either become an associate member 
at ten dollars a year, or drop his mem
bership.
The discussion continued from the 
last meeting as to the advisability of 
having two meetings a month, was 
decided in the negative, on account 
of the heavy schedules carried by the 
clubs members. The President appointd a member of each of the elec
trical classes to obtain the names of 
those who wished to join the club and 
who would take an active part in its 
work. The usual eats after adjourn
ment completed the evening.
THE PLEBE SMOKER 
A ROUSING SUCCESS.
The smoker of the Class of 1916, 
School of Applied Industries, tendered 
the faculty and upper-classmen in the 
gymnasium Friday evening, Novem
ber 21st, will go down in the history 
of the school as an event of extraordi
nary merit. Following the custom of 
last years entering class in giving 
such a reception, the class of 1916 de
cided to elaborate on the entertain
ment and to offer something distinct
ly worth while. The four hundred 
and more students, visitors and mem
bers of the faculty who -were present 
showed by their applause and words 
of commendation, that the hopes of 
the class were more than realized.
The major part of the entertainment 
consisted of a fully organized min
strel show. The stage setting and the 
attire of the four end men proved very 
effective. About thirty students acted 
as circle men. The singing was es
pecially good and showed some real 
talent. Much credit is due Socks 
Price for the training given the min
strels. Some clever jokes were got 
off on several members of the faculty.
The program, in full, was as fol

A feature which won much applanse

into the affair by a clever imitation 
of a street fakir selling tiger fat.

INTER-FRATERNITY DANCE.
The long talked of, and much 
dreamed about Inter-Fraternity Dance 
has come and went, so to speak. He 
who says that it was not a success 
beyond all hope of even the most op
timistic either was not there, or is of 
the type of human being known as 
non compus mentis. The dancing 
began at eight-thirty and even ending 
as it did at one oclock it was all too 
soon for the majority of those pres
ent. The music was of the very latest, 
and was intersperced with tangoes, 
onesteps, hesitations, and Bostons 
which gave those who are up in the 
Adelide Genee art, plenty of oppor
tunity to startle the more conserva
tive with some of the latest twists. 
Considering the amount of interest 
and enthusiasm that was shown in the 
dance this year, the Inter-Fraternity 
Dance bids fair to be one of the big 
social events of the year in the years 
to come as it justly should be.
BASKETBALL NEXT.
Schedule For Scrubs To Be Arranged.
Now that the football season is 
over, basketball will hold the attention of the Tech athletics and stu
dents. Practice was begun much ear
lier than usual this year, with the ob
ject of enabling the team to be in 
mid-season form for the opening 
games on the schedule. The results 
of this method will be closely followed 
and if successful, will probably be put 
into effect in the future. The prac
tices, held up to the present time 
three days a week, have been very 
strenuous. On the second team are 
players of Varsity caliber who make 
things interesting for the Varsity, so 
much so, in fact, that one or two of 
the latter will be uncomfortably 
pushed in order to maintain their 
former positions.
First Assistant Manager Wright an
nounces that a schedule will be ar
ranged for the scrubs. Those who 
do not make the first team1 will still 
have an opportunity to play in com
petition and will thus be rewarded for 
their hard work.
SOME OF THE DIFFICULTIES 
ENCOUNTERED IN DIAMOND 
DRILLING FOR IRON ORE.
By Wallace G. Imhoff, 09, Science.
Perhaps there is no line of work 
which draws on the tact and resources 
of the workers more than drilling for 
iron ore. Each one of the iron ranges 
of the Lake Superior Region presents 
its own problems, in fact the diamond 
drill holes are so varied that we might 
go so far as to say that each indi
vidual hole differs from all of the 
others.
There are hundreds of difficulties 
which arise from time to time, but 
only a few will be touched on here. 
Two of the ones encountered most 
frequently are sticking the bit and 
losing the core.
Sticking the Bit.
The bit is usually stuck at the be
ginning of a new run, that is when 
a bit is used. The continual wear 
on the sides of the old bit slowly 
grinds off the soft steel by rubbing 
on the outside rock of the hole. By 
the time the bit is worn on the cut
ting-edge so much as to be in dan
ger of losing a stone, the outside has 
also been worn until it is consider
ably smaller than the standard diam
eter of the bit.
The bit may or may not be chang
ed after the regular five-foot pullup, it all depends upon the character 
of the ground being drilled. I have 
seen the rock so hard in one instance 
that but four inches were drilled in 
twenty-four hours with three changes 
of bits; also the ground so soft that 
one hundred and twenty feet were 
drilled with but one change of bits. 
The danger of sticking the bit lies 
in the fact that the hole tapers down 
as the old bit wears off and becomes 
smaller, then when a new bit of stand
ard diameter is used the hole has to 
be reemed down to the depth where 
the old bit left off.
One bit was stuck by putting too 
much pressure on the drill rods when 
starting with the new bit. Once the 
bit is tight there is great danger of 
twisting off the rods by continued 
turning, and this is especially true if 
the hole be very deep. This is a 
very serious difficulty as now there 
is danger of three things,
1stLosing the bit,
2ndBreaking a stone in recovery,
3rdDanger of twisting off the 
rods.
In trying to recover the bit any one 
of the three above mentioned loses 
may happen at any time. If the rods 
will not come loose by gentle turning 
another method may be tried. This 
is to run steam down the rods for a 
short time. The rods when heated 
expand considerably, in this particu
lar instance from three to four inches. 
The rods are again tightly clamped 
by the safety block and allowed to 
cool. Here again is the danger of 
breaking the rods when they con
tract.
This method having also failed to 
loosen the bit as an extreme resort 
the rods may be alternately hammered 
up and down. This method is abso
lutely forbidden the runners as the 
chances are ten to one of breaking a 
stone. In this particular instance the 
bit was finally loosened after one hour 
and a quarter of the most careful alter-nate hammering^ and when the 
rods were pulled to the surface all 
of the stones were in a sound condi
tion.
Losing the Core.
One of the commonest difficulties 
encountered in diamond drilling is 
losing the core. It often happens that 
the core-spring in the core-shell fails 
to catch the core and the rods are 
drawn to the surface only to find the 
core-barrel empty. Ordinary diamond 
drilling has to be done with the use 
of considerable water, otherwise the 
friction of the turning rods would 
soon melt the soft steel in the bit. 
The water is used for cooling pur
poses and also to wash the rock cut

tings to the surface to furnish the 
sludge sample. Diamond drill sam
ples consist of both core and cut
tings.
In order to recover the core left 
in the bottom of the hole the diamond 
bit is unscrewed from the core-shell 
and the rods again lowered down the 
hole. The diameter of type inside 
of the core-shell is considerably larg
er than the inside of the bit and 
this is taken advantage of by trying 
to push the core again up into the 
core-barrel. As the core is of much 
smaller diameter than the hole, it 
often falls over on its side and some 
of the pieces lie horizontally in the 
hole rather than remaining in a ver
tical position. If the core cannot be 
made to again go up inside of the 
core-barrel it then has to be chopped 
up with a chopping-bit, a procedure 
very tedious and one of considerable
delay.
If the core can be made to go up 
into the core-barrel then its recovery 
is simple. The rods again down in 
the bottom of the hole and the core 
in the barrel, they are revolved at a 
high speed with pressure, and the hole 
is kept dry as possible. The fric
tion with the increased pressure over
turns the end of the blank core-shell 
which welds the core tightly in the 
end and this prevents the core above 
from falling out when the rods are 
raised.

CLASSIFIED LIST OF TARTAN ADVERTISERS
We have classified our advertisers so that our readers may use the list 
for reference before making purchases. The grouping furnishes an excellent 
variety of merchants for any article which a student, alumnus or faculty 
member would be likely to buy, and there is no valid reason of which we are 
aware that would justify anyone interested in the welfare of The Tartan in 
making purchases from any but merchants who so kindly make such a publi
cation possible. Be sure, also, to give one of the purchase stubs, which you 
will find enclosed in your Tartan every other week, to the clerk from whom' 
you make the purchase. The stubs, we have found, make pleased advertisers 
and help to get new ones. May we depend upon YOU to take this as a re
sponsibility to your Institution and to The Tartan.

A Novel Electrical Clock
Daniel Drawbaugh, a pioneer elec
trical inventor, whose activities es
pecially in telephone lines are well 
known, in the late sixties built a clock 
which is now running at Carlisle, Pa., 
in the office of his son, Charles H. 
Drawbaugh. The clock has contin
ued to operate since 1870, except when 
being moved from place to place, and 
operates without winding. The pen
dulum, weighing forty-five pounds, is 
operated by an ordinary electro-mag
net and a permanent magnet arma
ture, the current in the electro-mag
net being reversed as it passes the 
armature. The battery consists of a 
plate of copper and another plate of 
iron, which are buried in the earth. 
These plates give a small electro-mo
tive force, and enough current to 
keep the pendulum swinging. A pe
culiar feature of the clock is the comBall and Party Accommodations
