Athletic Board Views 
Tech Sports Aims
The Carnegie Tech Athletic Board, President Stevers primary advisory group on athletics, met last 
Tuesday at the presidents request to initiate a re
view of the schools athletic policies and programs.
The board, composed of representatives of students, 
faculty, alumni, and trustees, began the two and one 
half hour long session with a statement by George 
K. Brown, dean of the Division of Student Affairs, 
outlining the fundamental points of Carnegie Techs 
present policies.
Sororities Pledge
Fifty-eight Women
Fifty-eight women accepted bids from Carnegie 
Techs seven sororities on December 20, culminating 
formal rush for 1965.
Sisters And Pledges Celebrate
SnS Holds 
Auditions For 
Nouveau
Auditions will be held by 
Scotch *n* Soda for its 1966 
production Nouveau, 
Friday, December 3 and 10 
from 4:30 to 8:30 and Sat
urday, December 4 and 11 
from 12 to 4:30, in the 
Ski bo Wherrett Room.
Nouveau" is a musical come
dy about the aesthetics and inte
grity of art, in particular, of one 
artist in California today.
There are four principal char
acters, who must be able to sing 
and dance. The cast also includes 
seven featured parts and a chorus 
of about 18 or 20.
Those who audition will be ex
pected to perform with a ballad 
and a fast or up number. Those in
terested are advised to bring sheet 
music; a pianist will be provided. 
Also, auditionees will be asked 
to read for various parts in Nou
veau. If anyone is interested in 
dancing, a short number or exer
cise should be prepared.
Rehearsals for Nouveau will 
not begin until March 1966. Re
hearsals for the principal charac
ters, however, will begin earlier 
with song rehearsals.
The purpose of having auditions 
so far in advance is to facili
tate the orchestration of show 
numbers, and the design and pre
paration of costumes.
It is suggested that those inte
rested in auditioning come early. 
People interested in working on 
the technical staffs should sign 
up during audition times outside 
the Wherrett Room.
Tech Receives 
$10,000 Grant
Dr. H. Guyford Stever, presi
dent of Carnegie, has announced 
the receipt of an unrestricted gift 
of $10,000 from the American Oil 
Foundation.
According to L. W.Moore, pres
ident of the American Oil Founda
tion, the gift may be applied wholly 
or in part toward research, faculty 
salaries, libraries, training teach
ers, operating costs, building pro
grams, or any other desired pur
pose.
The gift is one of 77 unrestrict
ed grants made in 1965 to out
standing private universities by 
three related foundations: the 
Standard Oil (Indiana) Foundation, 
supported by standard Oil Company 
(Indiana); the American Oil Foun
dation, supported by the Ameri
can Oil Company, (Indiana Stand
ard's principal domestic marketing-refining subsidiary); and Pan 
American Petroleum Foundation, 
supported by Pan American Pe
troleum Corporation.

In his statement, Dean Brown 
made the following three asser
tions : first, that Carnegie Techs 
Athletic program is not aimed 
at a professional or commercial 
level; second, that sports is con
sidered an adjunct program to th( 
academic curricula; and third, that 
varsity, intramural, and physical 
education programs all serve im
portant functions in Carnegie 
Techs athletic programs.
Although it was generally agreed 
that Carnegie Tech has adhered 
to these policies, it was assert
ed by some board members that 
the Administration has failed to 
articulate this explicitly, especial
ly to the faculty. This failure was 
cited particularly with regard to 
the second point, stating that the 
athletic program is considered an 
adjunct to the academic curricula.
EsA3tCl3te Maw EsAn3Cl3te
As discussion proceeded, it was 
brought to light that there is an 
imbalance between varsity and in
tramural sports, and although stu
dents support the intramural pro
gram enthusiastically, there is far 
less support for the varsity pro
grams. Various causes were cited 
as being responsible for this dis
parity.
Some maintained that the varsity 
program does not engender pride in 
the minds of the players, while the 
intramural program does.
The fact that fraternities favor 
intramural sports over varsity 
sports, was cited as another cause, 
which President Stever found
flabbergasting. Other reasons 
named for the lack of support in 
varsity program included such 
items as lack of team success, 
academic problems among the 
players, etc.
Although certain board members 
believed that the varsity teams, 
not competing with comparable 
teams, President Stever asserted 
that they were not outclassed, 
but outnamed. Dr. Stever reite
rated this belief in a letter to the 
editor of the Tartan, which ap
pears on page five of this issue.
Further discussions analyzed 
these problems more closely, but 
no definite conclusions were 
reached. To further implement 
its review of Carnegie Techs ath
letic policies, the board mem
bers believed that they needed a 
more comprehensive understand
ing of student and faculty opin
ions regard sports on this cam
pus. The board, therefore, assign
ed to the student and faculty repre
sentatives to obtain this informa
tion and report back to the board 
at its next meeting, on December 9.
fn75 vdCCiAAnn
To fulfill this responsibility, 
the Tech Committee of Student 
Congress, chaired by Jane Hornick, sophomore, biology, will 
meet with the student represen
tatives to the board, and cap
tains of the varsity teams. The
Tech Committee urges any other 
interested students to participate 
in these meetings, and to offer 
their opinions regarding Carne
gie Techs athletic programs. To 
get a more complete picture of stu
dent opinions, the committee is 
interested in hearing from both 
those students who advocate fur
ther improvements in athletics 
and those who are in favor of fur
ther de-emphasis on sports. In
terested students may contact Miss 
Hornick, in Morewood Gardens, 
5C9, telephone 682-8891.

At the house managers meet
ing, complaints were voiced about 
the duplexes. Apparently, cer
tain improvements made on the 
later houses have not been instal
led in the older structures. Other 
improvements discussed were: 
better parking facilities, a more 
economical trash pick-up service, 
and a possible adjustment in main
tenance costs.
Ways of improving communica
tion and understanding between the 
faculty and the fraternities were 
also discussed. It was decided that 
more faculty members would be 
encouraged to visit the houses and 
talk with the brothers.
Although the possibility of a 
mid-semester Rush was consider
ed, plans were drawn up for sec
ond semester activities. These 
will be distributed during Rush, 
The final Rush events of this 
semester will be informal parties 
on December 3 from 8:30 p.m. to 
1 a.m. Next semesters schedule is 
as follows: February 3, 5 p.m. to 
7:30 p.m., formal dinner; Febru
ary 4, 7 p.m. to 10 p.m., infor

formal dinner; February 12, 8:30 
p.m. to 1 a.m., informal party; and 
February 14, pledging.
According to the Council of Fra
ternity Presidents, rush is going 
very well this year with slightly 
more freshmen visiting the houses 
than usual.
Spiritual Healing
Francis William Cousins will 
discuss The Achievement of 
Spiritual Healing," is a free 
Christian Science lecture on Tues
day, December 7 at 4;45 p.m. in 
the Skibo Wherrett Lounge.
Cousins, who was formerly as
sociated with a company of West 
African merchants, resigned in 
1951 to devote his full time to the 
public practice of Christian 
Science healing. He is currently 
on tour as a member of the Board 
of Lectureship of the FirstChurch

will go active some time in Feb
ruary.
This years formal rush accep
tance quota, thirteen was deter
mined by the number of girls par
ticipating in rush as of November
17. Because the sororities have 
not reached their membership 
ceiling they will distribute open 
bids through the year. Any fresh
man with factor who attended Open 
House and any upperclassman who 
has been on campus for a year or 
more are eligible for such bids.
Reviewing this years rush, Pam 
Mayer, president of Panhellenic 
Council commented: This has 
been one of the best working rush
es because the sororities had 
floors which deepened unity and 
increased efficiency. I would like 
to encourage all persons inte
rested in sororities to come and 
visit the floors and see the groups 
in action.
Fraternities Consider
Greek Week Ideas
During Greek Week several conclusions were drawn 
and recommendations made with regard to the future 
of the fraternity system at Carnegie Tech.
The committee of stewards explored the prospect 
of co-operative buying. Plans were made to investi
gate possible distributors, and to determine a more 
effectual system of buying common articles.

Lecture Presented On 
Dynamics Of Composition
:5tABa rdis1 Ns vtCFla
by Tina Enteil
Barbara Morgan, whose paint
ings and photographs are on dis
play in the Hewlitt Gallery, dis
cussed Dynamics of Composition* 
last Wednesday in Breed Hall.
Mrs. Morgan studied art at 
UCLA and was later a member 
of the faculty there. She then went 
to New York where she worked with 
painting, graphics, and photo
graphy.
Mrs. Morgan is best known for 
her book of photos of the dancer 
Martha Grahame and also a book 
of children entitled Summers 
Children.* Her exhibits include a 
one-man show at New York's Mus
eum of Modern Art.
For her lecture, Mrs. Morgan, 
with the aid of slides, spoke about 
space age photography including a 
concise history of the art with 
examples of some of her own work.
By contrasting pictures from the 
flight of astronaut White with those 
of one-cel led organisms, she 
showed how related the micro and 
the macro existences are and how 
they come to be synthesized. The 
space photos also conveyed a sense 
of weightlessness which she com
pared to an embryo intheamniotic 
fluid.
Thus the question was raised 
whether weightlessness is a spir
itual and innate quality or a dy
namic physical manifestation. 
Even though she showed a repro
duction of an El Greco painting in 
which figures seemed to be float
ing, Mrs. Morgan made the point 
that the art of the past was dom
inated by gravity and characterized 
by the rest state. She began to speak 
more of composition itself and its 
relationship to motion. There must 
be a counter motion or center of 
interest to sustain the drama of the 
flow of motion. But in order to 
foresee just what the outcome of 
a particular photo will be, the 
artist must pre-vision it. He must 
mentally conceive of the timing be
fore it happens. He must get in the 
mood of a particular subject and 
sensitize himself to deeper per
ceptions, even to the point of an
ticipating the subjects next re
flex, breathing pattern or muscle 
tension.
When asked whether she pre
ferred painting to photography 
Mrs, Morgan replied that she could

not align herself with either one 
solely. Photography differs from 
painting mainly in that it requires 
less sensuous contact with the 
production medium.
It is necessary to consider 
optics, chemistry and light in com
bination. Yet it is essential for 
Mrs. Morgan to project herself into 
her photographs. It isn't reality 
that shes primarily interested in, 
rather it is how she feels toward 
her subject matter. It is necessary 
for her to get attached to the cam
era she is using at a specific time 
and feel a relationship with it. To 
her, the dynamics of composition in 
photography include enthusiasm 
and emotional and intellectual dy
namics that drive one towards a 
subject. She feels that one must 
project all these through the ap
plication of technology.
By affecting slight distortions, 
modifications of white and black, 
precise timing that can suggest 
moods from the tense to the lyrical, 
the photographer can modify real
ity. Emotion is an initial part of 
dynamics; a relation between 
forces is imperative, for one pic
ture can set off a chain of emo
tional responses and sub-themes.
Mrs. Morgan prefers working 
on multiple picture compositions 
rather than individual pictures. At 
present she is working on a project 
reflecting a satirical reaction to 
space age thinking. She believes 
that man is so much machine now, 
that though he should remain as 
human as possible, he should know 
and apply technology.

the second week in January in the

These will be used by the Red 
Cross for Americans wounded in

Boris Play 
Opens Dec. 1
Bob Boris, sophomore drama, is 
the auther of Alan*, a play to be 
produced by the Carnegie Tech 
drama department December 1.
Boris, a native of New York 
city, has previously had work pro
duced off Broadway. His play was 
presented at the Mermaid The
ater 19.
Edgar Weinstock, graduate 
drama, is the director of *Alan\ 
At the same time Weinstock is 
starring in the Critics Choice 
in McKeesport, Pennsylvania. 
Weinstock views Boris* play as a 
work to which the audience must 
give itself completely in order 
to reap the fullest meaning and 
understanding of what the playwriter is attempting to convey.
"When sanity is established as 
a condition and a person is belted 
and belted and belted and still gets 
off the ground, and responds and 
is able to sit in the same room, 
love can be proven. This Is the 
only kind of love that can be proven 
for all others depend on tones of 
voice, erestures tolerance and van. 
ity. Love comes from the bottom 
of the barrel not focusing upon 
economics or morality, but par
ticular circumstances being 
against you.*
The play is devoid of structure. 
Any structure must be established 
by the director, actor, and aud
ience. *A communication of vision 
and the use of moral judgment are 
necessary. The characters, just 
as the play itself, make the real
ists look like pansies. This play is 
real, down to earth, stated Wein
stock.
Speaking of his role as director 
Weinstock commented, The di
rector is the liaison between the 
playwrites needs and the actors 
ability to communicate. A vis
ual statement must sustain this 
sensitive performance.*
Boris expressed his attitude to
ward the production when he said, 
There are many phases of learn
ing at Tech. Courses, and indiv
idual instruction are directed to
ward the one moment of achieve
ment, the writing and production 
of this play. Being able to work 
with Edgar and learning from Ed
gar and the cast is the most ex
citing part and the beauty of be
ing at Tech. The trusts and com
munications involved cannot be 
equaled. The Studio projects and 
other creative work at Tech makes 
the drama department what it is.

(drive coordinator) and the Amer
ican Red Cross student affairs 
director, Clyde McDonald. The 
committee has no political affil
iation.
According to Marvin Donner, 
assistant dean of men, the total 
success of the program will be 
directly proportional to the amount 
of enthusiasm which can be gen
erated.
If enough people respond to meet 
the blood quota, the American Red 
Cross will supply complete facil
ities in the Ballroom for the 
greatest ease and comfort of the 
donors.
According to McDonald, only 
50% of those donors pledged to 
give blood will be assured of an 
acceptance of their pledges. Nerv
ous conditions, colds, viruses and 
cases of hepatitus in the family 
are grounds for rejection by the 
Red Cross. Blood tests taken be
fore the donation will reveal both 
blood type and any possible sources 
of infection. Therefore, as least 
five hundred pledges of one pint 
each must be obtained before the 
program will be implemented.
A rest period of one hour will 
be required after donation. Re
freshments will be served at that 
time. The committee is attempt
ing to obtain excuses from classes 
for participants.
Donors between the ages of 18 
and 21 must have parental per
mission to give blood. On page 3 
of this issue is a release slip 
which must be signed by the par
ents of those minors who wish to 
give. Also included is a blood do
nation pledge form. Both should 
be completed as soon as possible 
so that the committee can best
estimate the response and ar
range the adequate facilities. Sim
ilar forms will appear in future is
sues of the Tartan.
Completed forms should be sent 
to the Office of the Dean of Men, 
c/o Marvin Donner.
Those over 21 should fill in the 
pledge from and submit it to the 
same address c/o Campus Mail.

Editorial
Infringement On Autonomous Operation
The tides that sway Student Government have carried it from in
activity and internal disorder to complete despotism and chaos. The 
biggest move in trying to insure the autocracy of the leaders of Student 
Government was the seizure of control of the student activity funds 
this fall.
Last spring, Student Government presented to the administration the 
student activities budget for 1965-1966. This budget contained explicit 
information on exactly how this money was to be spent. The adminis
tration approved the explicit budgetary recommendations, and on these 
grounds passed the student activities budget. Late last spring an in
ternal power struggle developed between two leaders of Student Con
gress for the position of chairman of that body. As a result the new 
chairman decided to change the specified allocations of several activ
ities. These allocations, including the Tartan's, were increased by us
ing money belonging in the matched advertising fund. As a consequence, 
the matched advertising which the publications were to receive was 
reduced.
This fall, these revisions in the budget were found to be unjustified, 
and Student Government decided to revise it once again. Instead of re
turning to the budget previously formulated, the powers-that-be deemed 
it necessary to alter it as they saw fit. In the meantime, the student 
activities had already begun to spend the money from this same budget, 
which was not yet in their possession.
Several activities, among them the Tartan and the Kiltie Band, suf
fered at the hands of Student Government as it tried to recover from 
its state of self-inflicted budgetary confusion. Student activities were re
quired to submit new budgets for 1965-1966, and the first of these sub
mitted by the Tartan was rejected.
In a letter to the Finance Committee Chairman of Student Government 
stated, "The Tartan budget has been rejected for a number of reasons-not 
all of which are sufficient... the actual rejection was based on the rec
ommendation of the PiDE representative.. .(who) recommended that the 
budget of the Tartan be rejected on the grounds that it probably could be 
reduced by $500, although he did not state where the reduction could be 
made. He also stated that since a part of the increase was to augment 
additional journalistic quality, through the increased need of photography, 
and that, because PiDE was not satisfied with the quality presented 
thus far, the budget should receive further consideration.*
The initial reviewing of publication budgets should take place in PiDE, 
(P. Delta Epsilon, national journalism honorary,) and recommendations 
made about each individual budget. Only when the budgets have met with 
PiDE approval should they be taken to Student Congress. When questions 
pertaining to publication budgets arise, either in Student Congress or 
Executive Council, PiDE, as the representative of student publications, 
should be held answerable.
The Tartan budget was passed by Student Congress, with PiDE 
approval, but met with opposition in Executive council led by the PiDE 
representative. The grounds for rejection of the budget, as stated in 
the previous quotation, should have never been presented in Executive 
Council, but should have been discussed in the initial reviewing of the 
Tartan budget held by PiDe. But due to the inadequacies within PiDE 
these questions were never asked, and hence never discussed.
At a subsequent meeting with the PiDE representative the Finance 
Committee Chairman of Student Congress, and the Treasurer of PiDE, 
the Tartan budget was discussed and reduced by $275. This revised 
budget again passed through congress, again with the apparent approval 
of PiDE, which had sanctioned the cut of $275, and the revision of the 
budget.
In a show of power, the Executive Council vetoed the Tartan budget 
a second time. This time, the reasoning was less logical and more 
tyrannical. In the following letter, again to the Finance Committee 
Chairman of Student Congress, the Treasurer of Student Government 
states, The budget was rejected for the following reasons;
1) As stated in my letter of November 8, 1965, the Tartan 
budget can be reduced further.
2) The large subsidy requested by the Tartan is not merited 
by quality of the publication, or the improvements planned for 
the physical plant.
3) There was no representative of the Tartan or PiDE present 
at the meeting on November 18."
Regarding the first point, the original claim that the Tartan budget 
could be reduced was made by the PiDE representative. This repre
sentative was present at the afore mentioned meeting where the 
Tartan budget was reduced, and approved this revision. By virtue of this 
fact, the PiDE representative should have been present at the November
18 meeting to state that he was satisfied with the revised budget, there
by invalidating points one and three. Actually point three (above) does 
not constitute a valid reason for the rejection of the budget. PiDE, as the 
representative of the publications, should have been there to present the 
Tartans case.
But since the PiDe representative is also a member of the Ex
ecutive Council, his absence is a problem internal to that body. Fur-; 
thermore, the Tartan is not accountable for the responsibility, or lack 
of it, of the members of Student Government.
Finally, the second point is totally inconsequential, and completely 
insufficient as grounds for rejection. Only in area of subsidization of the 
Tartan from student activities funds is the Tartan responsible to
Student Government. Fur
thermore, since the sub
sidy ultimately comes from 
the administration, Student 
Governments power ex
tends no further than crit
ically appraising the bud
gets, based on actual ex
penditures from previous 
years. Only extravagant 
spending, in the areas of 
capital goods, or operating 
expenses can it be validly 
questioned.
Executive Council has 
made a value judgment on 
the appearance of the news
paper and has applied it as
a criterion for rejection of 
the budget. The members of 
Executive Council, with the 
possible exception of the 
PiDE representatives, are 
in no way qualified to make 
value judgments on the 
journalistic quality of the 
Tartan. Furthermore such 
value judgments do not 
constitute a valid basis for 
the evaluation of any stu
dent activitys budget. Be
cause this body has not pre
sented any reasoning based 
solely on the financial ap
praisal of the budget, the 
Tartan refuses to revise
that budget.
The final decision con
cerning any aspect of pub
lication of the Carnegie 
Tech Tartan is the editors 
alone. Such a decision from 
an external source con
stitutes an infringement on

Critics Condemn 
Sidewalks, Tree Art
Editor, the Tartan:
Recently there has appeared on 
campus a rash of "cute" artworks 
on trees and sidewalks. While these 
may be humorous in content, we 
find their permanence annoying.
We ask if there is a way to 
clean a painted tree. One cant 
burn it off, as if it were concrete. 
Scraping is damaging. One can 
only live with a defaced tree for 
ten years until nature finally cleans 
it off.
Moreover, what does the visitor 
to Carnegie Tech think of the works 
of art. Ours is one of the most beau
tiful campuses in the city (try to 
find a tree to paint down on Fifth 
Avenue!). Yet we see fit to deface 
our own assets.
Clearly the solution is needed 
now. We ask that Carnegie Tech 
allot funds to remove or cover 
these scrawlings, where feasible, 
and assess a proper fine in future 
cases of defacing a permanent 
campus property.
However, we do not condemn all 
enthusiasts of the paintbrush. In
deed we must compliment certain 
artists who have used imagination 
and discretion, as well as humor, 
in their works. Sometimes it seems 
that the Fence is our only campus 
tradition, and one we shall re
member for many years. But ten 
years hence shall we see all the 
trees painted? and the sidewalks? 
And the buildings ? And the profes
sors?

cost of $1 for linens.
Morewood Library would be 
available for meetings.
In order to finance these ad
ditional dormitory activities, the 
Council is also considering a $1 
per semester activities fee, pay
able at registration. If acceptable 
to Congress, this fee would not be 
installed until next fall. This would 
enable the A.S.W. to make a full 
evaluation of the budget before 
definitely deciding upon the amount 
of the fee. 
tCommuters will vote for their 
Executive and Judicial Council 
representatives to the present 
Womens Dormitory Council on 
November 30 at 11;30 a.m. in the 
Skibo Wherrett Room. Before the 
vote is taken, a discussion period 
will be held.
Two upperclassmen and one 
freshman will be elected to Ex
ecutive Council, which meets Mon
day from 6 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. One 
upperclassmen and one freshman 
will be elected to Judicial Council, 
which meets on Tuesdays from 
6:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m.
Freshman representatives will 
not have voting power until second 
semester but they will be called 
upon to give their opinions. Resi
dent dormitory representatives 
have been given the same respon
sibilities.
Petitions for nomination will be 
at the Skibo information desk and 
Dean Milligan's office. Students 
with a 2.00 factor may nominate 
themselves or be nominated by 
someone in their class.
According to the present Dorm
itory Council: "It is hoped that the 
formation of the Association of 
Women Students will bring the 
dorm resident and commuter clos
er together by including the com
muter In dorm activities, by giving 
the commuter the use of dorm 
facilities, and by having the com
muter share in the responsibilities 
of government.

Womens Dorm Council Plans 
To Represent Commuters
by Sue Lohmeyer
Plans have been made to replace Womens Dormit
ory Council with a chapter of the Association of 
Women Students. This association would represent both 
dormitory residents and commuters.
Because the A.S.W. is a national society, the change 
must be approved by Student Congress and the national 
association.

To be judged a successful stu
dent, one soon learns that various 
strategies must be employed. In 
high school, acceptance to a 
good" college or university be
comes a primary goal in the 
lives of many students. Often for
ced upon him by parents or friends 
due to their quest for social mobi
lity, a battle begins in which the 
student can only lose.
Selective admissions policies 
cause the struggle to begin early. 
Grades become the primary ob
jective of education and such tests 
as the PSAT. SAT, and Advanced Placement Tests become motivat
ing factors in one's life. One ne
cessarily has to limit his true 
impulses and desires regarding 
outside learning experiences be

teams, and other student activiProgram Offers 
Study In Europe
The Institute of European Stud
ies, in Chicago, will accept ap
plications for its spring under
graduate study programs until De
cember 10.
Located in Friedberg, West Ger
many; Madrid, Paris and Vienna, 
the programs will emphasize lib
eral arts and social science stud
ies at the sophomore and junior 
levels. The institute also conducts 
full academic-year programs in all 
four locations, as well as Nantes, 
France.

ties require a good deal of time 
and these factors are definitely 
necessary to satisfy the demands 
of college admission.
The student who follows this pat
tern will probably be accepted to 
a good" university since he has 
channeled his life toward that end 
for a number of years. At college, 
if he finds his course work chal
lenging, he may feel the neces
sity to express some of the indi
viduality which has been silenced 
in his throughout high school. He 
will find that the classroom will 
limit him more than it will aid 
him in his search for discovery 
. . . for idealism ... for under
standing. The extreme rigidity of 
most course work hinders many 
students in their search for know
ledge, while more unstructured 
courses allow students to be indi
viduals - to learn in their own 
way.
Most of the courses at Carne
gie Tech, judging from my exper
ience, are overly rigid. Some pro
fessors seem to believe that rigi
dity is necessarily good. From a 
student's viewpoint, nothing can 
deflare the value of the education
al process more. Course work be
comes the sole goal of the stu
dents. These students are denied 
the opportunity to express part of 
themselves which maybe more im
portant than the course work itself. 
The opportunity to experiment with 
ideas that are never encountered in 
the classroom is similarly denied. 
Even though these ideas may prove 
to be fruitless, the experiences 
still are invaluable. Without this 
experimentation, the student may 
never be able to discover his in
dividuality, and without his indivi
duality, he can never really be a 
person.

Penn-B Form 
Suggested In 
Student Letter
The following letter to Dr. Rob
ert J. Kibbee, Carnegie Tech vice 
president for planning, is being 
circulated among the students by 
its author as a petition supporting 
the opinions stated within the let
ter regarding the academic cal
endar for the year 1966-1967.ed.
I spoke to you recently at your 
office about the proposed calendar 
change for Carnegie Tech. Since 
that time I have given further 
consideration to the proposals and 
spoken with other students. I would 
like to present my ideas in this 
letter in hopes that it, and the 
following petition, can be presented 
to the Calendar Committee at its 
meeting on November 30 as a 
further indication (beyond the cal
endar poll run by the Tartan, 
which I consider insufficient in 
itself) of student opinion on this 
matter.
Of the two alternatives to the 
present calendar, referred to as 
*Penn-B* and as-hoc*, I feel that 
the Penn-B calendar is decidedly 
preferable. The major difference 
centers around the period from 
the middle of December to the end 
of January, currently including 
Christmas vacation, finals, and 
intersession. The ad-hoc calen
dar would cut out the mid-term 
break, and it is this point to which 
I object.
The so-called vacations* at 
Thanksgiving, Christmas, and 
Easter are invariable periods of 
stress during which time the stu
dent is weighed down by the pres
sures of schoolwork, particularly 
since these periods are generally 
followed by exams and the sub
mitting of term papers. (This is 
most noticeable at Christmas.) 
Either the vacation* is substan
tially devoted to work, oras I 
believe to be more often the case 
the time proves particularly un
productive, but the worry of what 
should be done* remains; in either 
case the value of the vacation is 
lost.
It is only during interterm when 
courses are not in session that 
the student is free to enjoy him
self.
The ad-hoc calendar would in 
effect eliminate the only true va
cation presently existing during the 
school year. Ending final exams* 
might lessen the strain somewhat, 
but I believe the difference would be 
almost imperceptible. Important 
exams of some kind as well as 
the completion of term papers 
would inevitably await the student 
upon his return in January.

Prexy Congratulates 
Tech Football Squad
Editor, the Tartan;
There are many fine features of 
student activities, both curricular 
and extra-curricular, at Carnegie 
Tech. From time to time I hope 
to single out and comment on those 
that have particularly impressed 
me.
I want to congratulate all mem
bers of the C arnegie Tech football 
squad, and all those students who 
cheered it right down to the last 
minute of the last game of an ex
citing season. In the five games I 
saw, the team was never out
classed, but occasionally outmanned. Despite a poor won-lost 
record, the team spirit never nev
er lagged.
To the team members I want to 
say that everyone, friend and foe, 
who played against you or saw 
your games, thinks of you as tough 
competitors and good representa
tives of Carnegie Tech. My best 
to you.

From The Middle Of The Bus
by Michael Malakofff
Our First Activities
Our function in Newton was to try and help the local people them
selves. They indicated a preference for voter registration classes and 
the integration of three garment factories and one furniture factory. 
Because these factories, had from 150 to 750 people in their employ, 
they fell under the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which forbade discrimination. 
The people also desired to integrate cafes which refused to serve 
Negroes. Since no serious attempt had previously been made to in
tegrate these cafes, more trouble than usual was expected.
Two nights before, our project car had been stopped by the police and 
our director had been taken to the station where he was charged with 
speeding and fined. He had not been speeding. In fact, we had always 
made it a point to go five miles under the speed limit. The police, 
however, had followed us all over and stopped us at their discretion. 
Such is the attitude of the state police.
At our opening freedom rally we expected about 400 people. A clergy
man from Clark County was to speak with hopes that Mississippi would 
soon join the Union in mind as well as body.
A problem we had not considered was the unpaved roads in the Neg
roes communities. I had never realized how bad this problem was until 
the night it rained. Then, the roads became so muddy that we could not 
even drive on most of them. We had a voter registration schedule for 
that night but the roads were so bad that few people could make it.
New voting tests had been initiated two weeks before. The old test 
required people at the discretion of the registrar, to interpret sec
tions of the Constitution. Most college graduates could not interpret 
the questions asked of the Negroes.
The poll tax is another burden on the Negro which we hoped could 
soon be eliminated. At one class I was helping people who could not 
write registration forms. Hopefully, after much practice they would 
be able to go to the courthouse and register themselves. We had 
scheduled two or three classes every week. We also had set up a New
ton County Youth Club whose function was to test some of the eating 
facilities and other public places in town such as the swimming pool 
and movie houses. That day we gathered fifty members and went to 
Philadelphia to help those people test a swimming pool. The pool was 
immediately shut down due to non-compliance with the new Civil 
rights law.
George, our director, had helped open up Philadelphia two years 
before. He related an encounter that he had experienced with Sheriff 
Rainey at that time. The sheriff had said, Lookie here nigger, Ill 
give you until 10 o'clock to get your ass out of town or Pll throw it 
in jail.* George had responded, *l was born in Mississippi, I was born 
in jail so I'm going to stay right here.* He stayed. George told us that 
his knees were shaking so hard he didn't think he could stand.
The night before one of our protectors had shot his gun twice to let 
anybody in the area know that he was armed and alert. George was 
shaking then too. *1 got on my knees and prayed for fifteen minutes.*
Some things to me are hard to conceive. One must experience 
something to really understand it. Our biggest enemy is fear, fear of 
the white man. William refused on two different occasions to ap
proach a white mans house with me. He was afraid of beingshot. At 
a dance, a Negro girl was literally shaking while I slow-danced with 
her. Many Negroes, adults two and three times my age included, re
ferred to me as *Sir.* In many instances during our house-to-house 
canvassing, we were the first white people to ever greet the woman of 
the house as * Maam* and shake her hand.
After 150 odd years as being referred to as *boy,* the Negro has a 
basis for his fear. He is afraid of violence to his home and family, 
of losing his job  if he has one. We received bomb and arson threats 
during our stay. The Negro has experienced them all during his life.
We felt that we can advance rapidly in Newton. Some people would 
not open their doors to us because their ministers said we represented 
the devil and God would come soon and show them the way. These were 
thankfully few in number. Most felt that God had sent us but that they 
had to take that first step. Sunday, the day of our opening freedom 
rally, we hoped would indicate this.
Awareness
The Best
Education?
by Allen Michel
Is the education we are receiv
ing at Carnegie Tech the best pos
sible education Tech could offer? 
This question, I believe, is im
perative for each Tech student to 
ask himself.
There are two types of cur
ricula, professional and non-pro
fessional. Think of thecourses you 
are now taking or will be taking. 
Do you believe that they will pre
pare you sufficiently to partake and 
enjoy the many riches which will 
become available to you? You and I 
are not going to spend our lives 
isolated in laboratories or perched 
in studios. No! We will be exposed 
to literature, art, science, and 
philosophy. To enjoy these facets 
of life, we must have some know
ledge about them. But do we?
The Tech education is one which 
prepares us excellently for our 
chosen profession, but it leaves 
little room in our schedules for 
courses which can add to lifes 
meaningfullness. We are being 
subjected to professional course 
after professional course result
ing in a dangerous void in our 
knowledge of the humanities. Col
lege is the ideal place to become 
exposed to the many branches of 
thinking outside our small do
main of knowledge. We came to 
Carnegie Tech to be prepared for 
the future. Is Tech neglecting its 
duty in preparing only the one
sided man?*

Continued from Page 5 
In contrast to this, the Penn-B 
calendar allows for a combination 
Christmas vacation and interterm 
enabling the student to fully en
joy the holiday season, while still 
providing a term equal in length 
to the present one by beginning a 
week earlier in September. This 
last point might initially seem ob
jectionable to some students, but 
I am certain that can be overcome 
by the realization that, as a sec
ondary effect of the Penn-B propo
sal, spring semester would end 
earlier and summer vacation  
rather than being shortened  
would actually be a week longer 
than under the present system. 
This early ending might also prove 
advantageous to students seeking 
summer employment.
In view of these arguments, if a 
calendar change is to be made, I 
feel that the Penn-B plan offers 
several significant advantages 
over the ad-hoc plan. I would great
ly appreciate your consideration of 
my letter in making the final 
decision.

' Gridders Finish Frustrating Year; 
Dropped Five Tough Contests
Two Saturdays ago, for the third straight year, Carnegie Tech finished a football 
season with only one victory. This years team was different, however, in that 
$ it was in almost every game all the way ~ where the previous seasons were 
years of depression, this year was a year of frustration.
The Tartans gave up the de
ciding touchdown to Wooster with 
two minutes left in the game, to 
F & M with 1:44 left, to West
minster with 1:54 left, and to W 
& J with 5:50 left. Time ran out 
in the Case game with Tech 19 
yards away from a winning TD.

What with the administration's 
practically nonexistent athletic po
licy and the unwillingness of men 
students to go out for the team, 
Tech fielded a squad of just 26 
players. Platooning was impossi
ble, and obviously the overwork
ed (and usually outweighed) Tar
tans often faded late in the game.
Even so, teams that expected 
Tech to roll over and play dead 
usually found themselves suddenly 
struggling to catch up.
Tech's big weapon was the pass
ing of quarterback Tom Hubka, 
who set an all-time Tech record 
by throwing 15 touchdown passes, 
nine of them to flanker Rich Bell. 
Hubka, despite having to scramble 
constantly, completed just under 50 
per cent of his passes for 1359 
yards, figures that compare favo
rably with the ten-game totals of 
many major-college passers.
Bell (who is only five foot nine), 
along with ends Bill Coleman and 
Jim Clark, made the Tartans a 
threat to score on almost any play.
However, opposing quarterbacks 
also found it easy to pass against 
Techs secondary, which made for 
exciting football games but fre
quently cost the Tartans dearly.
The defensive linemen and line
backers looked good at times and 
figured considerably in the vic
tory over Allegheny, when they 
chased Gator QB Jack Bowlfng all 
over the field.

Barring another academic di
saster like this years, when half 
of the freshmen from the 1964 
team failed to come back to Tech, 
prospects for next year look bright. 
Only three regulars are graduat
ing: co-captain Bill Coleman; his 
fellow co - captain Dick Merrill, 
who led the team in rushing yard
age despite injuries; and Tom 
Glassberg. Glassberg was an al
ternate for freshman Ron Horn, 
who is probably the only 160-pound 
center in the country.
Another freshman, Larry Getto, was listed as a quarterback,

Tech will not have such a height disadvantage this year.
Last years team only won four 
of nineteen games, but a transfer 
student, a previously ineligible 
player, and six lettermen give 
Tech fans a genuine cause for op
timism this year.
The transfer student is six-footsix, 215-pound Jim Brown, a sopho
more architect who came to Tech 
from Denison last year. Eligible 
for the first time this season, 
Brown will team with 64 junior 
Jeff Kalin at forward to give the 
Tartans an unprecedented re
bounding strength that has Coach 
Cratsley gloating.
Kalin, last years leading scor
er, rebounder, and Most Valuable 
Player, even grew an inch during 
the off season.
Starting center Don Keefer is 
only 5 10, but can dunk the ball. 
Last year he consistently startled 
unsuspecting crowds at away gam
es by outjumping mountainous op
ponents for the opening tipoff.
Tech will also have a sharp 
outside shooter in senior Ray Mor
rison, who missed last season be
cause of grade trouble but should 
be eligible this year. Morrison led 
the team in scoring as a freshman 
and sophomore.
Starting at the other outside 
position is Ray Burdett, a 6 1 
junior and a defensive specialist.
A freshman who might play a 
good bit is Mark Lang, a six-footfour forward from South Hills 
Catholic in Pittsburgh. Pete Ricardella, a first stringer last year; 
senior letterman Chester Reft; and 
sophomore Neal Houser should 
also play regularly.

Seminar Focuses 
On US and Japan
The American Assembly, found
ed by Dwight D. Eisenhower in 
1950, when he was president of 
Columbia University, conducted a 
seminar on the Carnegie Tech 
campus last week.
The seminar focused on The 
United States and Japan, their 
foreign policy, trade and cultural 
relations. Representatives of both 
governments and of the Pittsburgh 
community took part in the dis
cussions.
The program was sponsored by 
The World Affairs Council of Pitts
burgh with the intention of giving 
participants *an opportunity for 
discussions to help form sound 
conclusions for national policy 
on vital issues." Conclusions 
reached during the discussions will 
be published and distributed.
Three - Way Tie 
In Soccer Loop; 
Grad Nads Win
In intramural soccer action last 
week the Grad Nads clinched first 
place in the Browns League while 
the race in the Packers League 
ended in a three - way tie.
The Nads scored a convincing 
5-0 shutout over PiKA to become 
the only team to finish undefeat
ed. PiKA took second place in the 
league by beating SAE 2 to 0.
BTP, SN, and the Dorm Tro
jans all came out with regular - 
season records of 5 and 1 in the 
hectic Packers League when the 
Dorm Trojans knocked off BTP 
2-1 on two last-minute goals but 
then lost 3-0 to SN the next day. 
In a playoff the Trojans bounced 
back to eliminate SN 2-1. On Sun
day, a final playoff for first place 
in the league ended in a slushy, 
rain-soaked tie between the Betas 
and the Trojans when the game 
was called at 2-2 after two over
time periods.
Championship playoffs will thus 
probably not be able to start until 
after Thanksgiving vacation.
Play Starts ln> 
I.M.Volleyball
Intramural six-man volleyball 
season started this past week with 
most of the top teams getting off to 
slow starts.
In the Set League SAE B, 
last years school champion and f 
pre-season favorite, wonlastweek 
on a forefeit. ATO A, their 
chief competition in the league, had 
to go three games before beating 
a BTP C team that played with 
only five men.
In the Serve League, which 
should provide the close league 
race, the Dunkers lost to a slowstarting TDP A team in two 
straight games. Then they rebounded to beat the Grad Nads, 
runner-up in the school last year, 
15-6 before succumbing 15 - 5,
15 - 10.
Spike League - Neither SAE 
A nor the Civil Hammers had 
trouble disposing of the Laundrymen.
Pass League - GSIA F easily 
beat the Notes to Win. BTP A, 
fourth in the school last year, was ^ 
streaky against the Notes.
