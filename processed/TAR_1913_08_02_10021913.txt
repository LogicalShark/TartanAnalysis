The annual contests between the 
Sophs and the Plebes, staged last Fri
day afternoon, resulted in a decisive 
victory for the second year men. The 
panic-stricken, persecuted Plebes, em
bittered by individual struggles 
against the sophisticated Sophomores, 
appeared on the field of conflict, 
united in their determination to obtain 
revenge for the insulting indignities 
rained upon them. They relied 011 
their numbers to gain their end, but 
to no avail, for they were compelled 
to face their rivals on equal terms.
The first events on the program 
were the wrestling matches which 
proved the closest of the contest. In 
the lightweight class, Holeton, a 
Sophomore of the Industry School, 
was forced to struggle the entire five 
minute preiod to gain the decision 
over his freshman foe, Gullett. In 
the middleweight class, Sherbian, a 
Science Plebe, brought joy to the 
hearts of his classmates and short
lived visions of victory by throwing 
his opponent, Baker, in three minutes. 
The heavyweight bout was a long 
tussle which ended in a draw between 
Daugherty, Sophomore, and Hill, 
Plebe. The score was then tie at 3.
At this point in the proceedings, a 
surprise was sprung upon the smiling 
spectators. Their smiles developed 
into uncontrolable outbursts at the 
sight of two stout figures frantically 
endeavoring to outfoot each other in a 
fifty yard race. Jones, a Design Plebe, 
who bids fair to become a renowned 
artist, struggled, squirmed and finally 
dragged his two hundred and seventy 
pounds of flesh and bone over the 
finish line ahead of his Sophomore ad
versary, Thoma, who was hampered 
with ten additional pounds of avoirdu
pois. An interesting problem in me
chanics is offered to the upper-classmen to determine the energy expend
ed by each runner. This victory gave 
the Plebes a two-point lead. But 
they could not maintain it.
The second scheduled event, the In
dian Ball contest with eleven men 011 
a team, was captured by the Sophs. 
/Led by R. W. P. Colvin, ex-captain 
of the basketball team, they were able 
to defeat their less experienced oppoinents captained by A. W. Long. The 
score then stood 8 to 5 in favor of the 
Sophs who were never again headed.
The next two events brought forth 
(Continued on Page 6.)
On next Saturday the curtain will 
be rung up on the 1913 football season 
for Carnegie. The first performance 
will be staged at State College, Pa., 
Penn State being the opposing team. 
Unfortunately, our men will go into 
their hardest game without the ex
perience of a previous contest, but 
both coaches and team realize the ne
cessity of preparation and will be 
ready to put up a stiff fight against 
the Blue and White.
According to present indications, 
the squad that will represent Tech 
this year will be much heavier than 
those of the last few seasons. Seventy-two candidates have applied for 
places on the team to date, of whom 
but four were letter men last year. 
The scrub team of last season has 
furnished nine more, and the remain
der are new men. The record is re
markable when considering the fact 
that only day students are being 
drawn this year. From an aggrega
tion like that 011 the field each even
ing, the coaches will have little trou
ble gathering eleven regulars that 
should put Carnegie Tech into the 
limelight for the season.
Short scrimmages were on the pro
gram last week, and these have been 
lengthened into brief games this week. 
The squad was reduced on Monday, 
and twenty of the men were put on 
the training table on that day. The 
old dressing rooms under the grand 
stand were remodeled, thoroughly 
cleaned and fitted with the utensils 
necessary for the job of preparing 
and serving wholesome food for the 
athletes. Chef Emil Haeffele put up 
the first meal at noon on Monday and 
the lucky star boarders have been en
joying and talking about their tri
umph each day since. The training 
table is an innovation at Tech that 
promises to be indispensable. Good, 
wholesome food in proper quantities 
will do more to keep the men on edge 
than anything else.
Most of the new candidates are af
ter places 011 the line and have weight 
enough to boost the team avet age 
above the usual weight of a Tech ag
gregation. Because of the lightness 
of this years backs, Head Coach 
Marks contemplates moving one or 
more of the line men into the back 
field. McCaughey was given a try at 
fullback last Saturday and his work 
(Continued on Page 6.)
Friday morning at 11:00 oclock, 
Director Hamerschlag gave a lecture 
on a Student's Code of Honor, to 
the student body in Carnegie Lecture 
Hall.
His theme was on the importance of 
the development of a code by each 
student, and he said that a student 
couldnt violate this code without los
ing something of his spiritual nature. 
A man must be true to himself above 
all else, and do what he thinks is 
right because it is right.
At the close of Director Hamerschlags talk short addresses were 
made by Miss Mary B. Breed, Dean 
of the M. M. C. S., Dean Connelley, 
of the Industries School, and Dean 
Hewlett, of the Applied Design. Dean 
Leete was excused as he was strug
gling with would-be students.
In accordance with the custom1 of 
sending the founder of the schools a 
message on the opening week, the 
following message was cabled:
Mr. and Mrs. Andrew Carnegie,
Skibo Castle,
Dornoch, Sutherland, Scotland.
Thirty-one hundred students of the 
Carnegie Institute of Technology, 
upon the opening of the ninth school 
year, send you a message of good will 
and appreciation of your beneficence 
in opening to them this wide door of 
opportunity.
Signed,
Presidents of the various classes.

George Leslie Langworthy, age 18, 
member of last years lower class, 
School of Applied Industries, died on 
June 22nd. He had been ailing for 
some time and was compelled to give 
up his school work last March. He 
began to travel with the hope of re
gaining his health but finally suc
cumbed to an attack of inflammatory 
rheumatism which affected his heart. 
He was popular among his classmates 
and held in high esteem by members 
of the faculty. The funeral took place 
from the residence of his parents, 
6601 Church avenue, Ben Avon, Pa.

The second annual Fall Festival 
held at the athletic field last Friday 
evening was a success beyond all ex
pectations. An attendance which 
taxed our stands nearly to their full 
capacity evidenced the popularity and 
interest of the student body in the 
festival, which must have been grati
fying to the committee in charge of 
the affair, who spent a great deal of 
time and effort in order to make it 
a success.
The festivities of the evening com
menced with an Indian fight. The 
warriors who ordinarily parade our 
halls and class rooms clad in modern 
attire, cast aside their dignity for the 
time being, and arrayed themselves 
in war paint and blankets, with a 
skill that would make the predecessor 
of the pale face turn green with envy. 
The battle with the Medicine Man of 
the defending tribe doing homage to 
the Great Father. This was followed 
by a corn dance of the tribe around 
the council fire. Unless our eyes 
failed us the turkey trot, tango and 
fish crawl must have been of Indian 
origin, for all three forms of dancing 
were resorted to by the warriors, 
which tends to disprove the theory 
that they are of Spanish origin. Prob
ably Columbus learned them from the 
Indians and in. turn taught them to 
Queen Isabella of Spain upon his re
turn home.
Hardly had the corn dance con
cluded before a frightful warwhoop 
from the nearby hill announced the 
arrival of the attacking party, and the 
terrible massacre that was to come. 
Then began a battle more horrible 
than words can describe. At each 
shot and thrust of the tomahawk some 
noble brave hit the dust, glorying in 
the thought that he had given his life 
in the defense of his chief. Fate, 
however, was against the defenders 
and at last their noble chief suc
cumbed, leaving the assailants the vic
tors of the day. Peace was then de
clared with the customary Pipe of 
Peace, and burying the hatchet, which 
has forever ended the hostilities be
tween the two warring tribes, namely 
the Plebes and the Sophs.

The preparations for the Indian 
scenes in the Fall Festival were quite 
elaborate and much credit should be 
given to the stage director, Professor 
Stevens. It was through him that the 
second Festival surpassed last years. 
The members of the various com
mittees worked hard in order that it 
may be a complete success.
The guns were loaned by Captain 
Niebaum, of the Washington Infan
try, to whom we extend our heartiest 
thanks.
The disorderly conduct of the 
Plebes and Sophomores when refresh
ments were announced as served, is 
to be deplored greatly. It is hoped 
that the under-classmen will soon 
have the true Tech spirit and such 
actions will not be seen again.
PLSBS C!P,v
The fact that the present Sopho
more class should deem it advisable 
to change the style and color of the 
caps that all Plebes must wear while 
upon the campus is to be deplored 
greatly. Although there was never 
a formal decree issued whereby any 
special style of hat was to be worn, 
yet it has been an unwritten law, that 
the former small Skull Cap should 
be the official head gear.
Another unwritten law was broken 
when the present hats were made 
alike in color, and not as in former 
years, when the Plebe of each school 
was distinguished by the color of the 
cap.
Such matters as breaking the tradi
tions of the school are not to be han
dled lightly. If it were deemed ad
visable that the head gear of the en
tering class should be changed, it 
should be brought before the repre
sentative body of the Schools, the 
Seannachie, by the Sophomores, or 
whoever was the cause of the change.
In order that there may not be a 
recurrence of the caps, it would be 
well if the Seannachie would pass a 
decree, stating the style of hats to 
be worn by the Plebes, and if prac
ticable, recall the present hats and 
have the regulation caps worn.

The initial try-outs for the Musical 
Clubs are scheduled for this week, the 
first having been held on Tuesday and 
the second being called for Friday. 
With this early start, the management 
hopes to have the concerts well under 
way within a month. The season 
promises to be a busy one, and in 
order not to crowd the concerts, it 
will be necessary to run a longer sea
son than the last.
The clubs are fortunate in having 
the same directors who have led the 
clubs for three seasons. That there 
has been a rapid and constant im
provement in the quality of the clubs 
has been due largely to the work of 
these leaders, Mr. McDowell of the 
Glee Club, and Signor Scalzo of the 
Mandolin Club.
Manager Hollister has prepared an 
attractive prospectus for the new sea
son, copies of which have been sent 
to all of the old patrons and a large 
number of new ones. The reputation 
of the clubs has extended to a con
siderable distance from Pittsburgh, 
and the trips of this season will be 
longer than ever before. This is of
fered as an inducement to the new 
men who possess any musical ability 
whatever. The directors and officers 
will welcome any such candidates.
Thursday morning the Design 
Plebes were invited to go out to the 
entrance and have their picture taken. 
It was then they were duly baptised 
into the Palace of Good Fellows.
The Design School is registered to 
its full capacity.
The first Class A Esquisse and Class 
B Esquisse-Esquisse were taken in 
the Loggia at the Design Building 
last Saturday. This marks the open
ing of actual work for the upper class
men.
Oh, you September Plebes!
The Sophomore Class of the De
sign School held their first meeting 
Monday and after a stormy session 
elected the following officers: Presi
dent, H. L. Heilman; vice president, 
R. I. Willson; Treasurer, R. Simp
son; barber, C. C. Britch.

From the New York Mail.
Bananas have become an important 
article of food to the whole people. 
In the poorest homes they serve to
reduce the cost of living by replacing 
more expensive fruits. Owing to their 
spontaneous growth throughout the 
tropics, and the possibility of trans
porting them easily in great quanti
ties wrhile green, bananas are about 
the cheapest fresh fruit the people 
have. But the Senate of the United 
States, in its anti-protective wisdom, 
in its noble effort to reduce the high 
cost of living, votes to impose a duty 
on bananas, which have always been 
free. Having become a necessity, or 
something very like it, the banana af
fords a chance to raise a revenue esti
mated at $5,000,000 a year, to take the 
place of protective duties on American 
products. Of course, this $5,000,000 
would have to come straight out of 
the pockets of the people.

From the Philadelphia Record.
An English scientist has raised the 
old cry that population is outstrip
ping the production of food, and that 
in the not distant future, perhaps be
fore the end of the century, posterity 
will be hard pushed to secure wheat 
enough for its daily bread. Why 
worry so much about posterity? Does 
not the Englishman know that the 
Canadian Northwest, which is not yet 
producing 200,000,000 bushels of wheat 
a year, can when more fully developed 
easly grow five times that amount? 
Then there is Siberia, where possi
bilities are enormous, not kb speak bf 
Australia and other countries whose 
resources have hardly been scratched. 
With better agricultural methods the 
United States could produce vastly 
more wheat than it does. Every gen
eration has its own problems which 
it must solve for itself, and the pres
ent seems to have more than its fair 
share. Let the people of the twentyfirst century tackle their own troubles 
when they arise.

Recent fatal accidents to aviators

The nation is just now celebrating 
the centenary of the soul-lifting vic
tory of Commodore Perry on Lake 
Erie. Again the land rings with We 
have met the enemy and they are 
ours. Not only had Perry beaten a 
navy trained under the great Nel
son, but he did it with ships built 
at home and in the crudest fashion.
That made it a genuine American 
triumph, for everything from rigging 
to the men behind the guns was 
American. In its war-tried stress the 
republic had to be self-sustaining and 
the people were proud of it.
But times change, and Americas 
greatest battleship is soon to be 
equipped with BritisTi turbines. Sec
retary Daniels balked at the prices 
which the only two bidders from the 
United States submitted, since they 
were nearly three times as large as 
that of the foreign concern which 
won the contract.
Just the same, a feeling of regret 
will stir the nation that our Navy 
is to have any British equipment. It 
ought not to be so. A land that can 
send its mechanical equipment to 
every quarter of the globe, that can 
reap the harvests in Russia, draw 
the trains in Palestine, span the rivers 
of Africa and light the homes of In
dia should have a pride in its Navy 
so high that every part of all its craft 
should be made in America.Phila

CANDIDATES!
Dggklhy Nlss Bg Agsdv
We wish to announce to the track 
aspirants a meeting that will take 
place in a few days. All of the candi
dates for the track team next spring, 
especially the Plebes, are requested 
to be present. (Notice of the meeting 
will be posted on the bulletin boards) 
As an incentive to the new men, Mr. 
Eyman, the physical training instruc
tor, has consented to excuse from the 
regular gymnasium classes, those who 
try for the team.
The work this fall will consist most
ly in cross-country running. The 
prospects for a winning team are un
certain until it is definitely known 
whether or not Capt. Haselton will 
return to school. Manager Miller an
nounces that several meets will be 
arranged and that G. A. Dull, the for
mer Michigan captain, will probably 
be retained as coach. Coach Dull as
sumed charge of the men last spring 
and with inexperienced material, 
rounded out a fairly well balanced 
team. In a recent interview with the 
manager, he stated he would be par
ticularly anxious to develop the first 
year men so that he could build up 
a nucleus for the teams in the future. 
It is important, therefore, that the 
Plebes as well as the other track men 
report for the fall training.
Watch the bulletin boards for notice 
of the meeting.

On Sunday, July 27th, Prof. David 
Burns, of the Faculty of the School of 
Applied Industries, was called by 
death. He had just returned home 
from a brief vacation in the West and 
was preparing to take a trip to Canada 
when he took ill suddenly and died 
after less than a weeks illness.
Prof. Burns was connected with the 
Schools almost from the beginning. 
He first served as an assistant engi
neer on the administrative staff. At 
the beginning of the school year of 
1907-08 he became a member of the 
teaching faculty in the Department of 
Mathematics of the School of Applied 
Industries, which position he has held 
up to the time of his death. He was 
secretary of the faculty and took a 
prominent part in faculty activities. 
He was also very popular with the 
students. At the interment were a 
large number of his former students 
and all of the members of the faculty 
who were in the city at the time. The 
faculty will take suitable action at its 
next regular meeting.

The duty of all schools, and es
pecially those in which industrial 
courses are offered, to inculcate in the 
minds of their students from their 
first moment in school, the idea of 
Safety First, was outlined by Dean 
C. B. Connelley, of the Carnegie In
stitute of Technology, in a paper he 
read Tuesday, September 23rd, before 
the second Safety Congress of the 
National Council for Industrial Safety 
at New York. Among those in at
tendance at the Congress are Gov. 
John K. Tener, Judge E. H. Gary, 
C. M. Schwab, and L. H. Burnett, of 
the Carnegie Steel Company of this 
city.
Dean Connelley declared that re
spect for human life is back of the 
movement and urged that public 
schools make it part of their curri
culum to safeguard against the par
ticular dangers of an industrial trade 
when it is being taught. He told how 
the Tech schools, the first institution 
to adopt this program', is carrying 
out the work with a safety appliance 
committee that inspects the equip
ment in the shops and recommends 
safety appliances, which has reduced 
the number of accidents from 84 dur
ing the first year and a half, to two 
during the past school year.
A politician, upon his arrival at one 
of the small towns in North Dakota, 
where he was to make a speech the 
following day, found that the two socalled hotels were crowded to the 
doors.
Not having telegraphed for accom
modations, the politician discovered 
that he would have to make shift as 
best he could.
He was compelled for that night to 
sleep on a wire cot, which had only 
some blankets and a sheet on it. As 
the statesman is a fat man, he found 
his improvised bed anything but com
fortable.
Well, asked a friend, when the 
politician appeared in the dining room 
in the morning, how did you sleep?
Oh, fairly well, replied the states
man, nonchalantly, but I looked like 
a waffle when I got up.

On Wednesday morning there ap
peared on the students bulletin board 
a proclamation which read like this: 
PLEBES! BEWARE!
No class pins, no rings,
Nor any such things.
One pigtail along and slim 
With green ribbons not dim.
On Thursday and Friday 
The Sophs will hold sway;
So be meek little little lambs 
And take all their slams.
No boys you must meet 
Nor greet on the street.
Put this in effect 
And treat the Sophs with respect.
Decreed by Sophs!
The next morning the Sophomores 
met bright and early at the corner of 
Forbes and Woodlawn avenues to see 
that their orders were obeyed. They 
had not long to wait before some meek 
little Plebes arrived with their hair 
in a braid. However, there were 
enough Plebes who had thought to 
disobey the proclamation in order to 
lend excitement to the scene.
After most of the Plebes had been 
captured they were formed in a line 
with their coats wrong side out and 
marched down to school. A few of 
the new Plebes had green linings to 
their coats and this added greatly to 
the color effect.
At the school they were met by a 
band of the Juniors who wanted to 
help the poor Plebes. So they all 
went to the locker room where a real 
fight was engaged in, the Plebes and 
Juniors against the Sophomores. The 
Juniors tried to help the Plebes put 
up their hair, while the Sophs insisted 
that they keep it down. The Sopho
mores said they won, so of course the 
credit is given to them1, but by now 
most of the Plebes had their hair up

Wednesday morning at nine oclock 
the M. M. C. S. had its first assem
bly of the year. The faculty and upper-classmen gathered in the auditor
ium and while they were singing the 
Womans Song the Plebes marched in.
Dean Breed addressed the students 
for the first time since she has filled 
her present position. She spoke about 
the aim of this school being to work 
and that unlike so many other schools 
it really lived up to its aims. Miss 
Breed said that she felt very much 
like a Plebe herself and would like to 
be made an honorary member of that 
class.
Miss Stoner then lead the students 
in singing Dear Old Carnegie, 
which it is hoped that the Plebes will 
soon learn.
The different student activities were 
then explained by Miss Ver Morcken. 
The Guild is the only charitable or
ganization in school and as such 
should be fostered as much as pos
sible. They meet once each month 
for little social gatherings and give an 
annual bazaar. The proceeds are giv
en to help some charitable organiza
tion in the city.
The Dramatic Club is formed from 
the students of the three upper class
es, for the study of good plays. Dur
ing the year this organization usually 
gives two or more good plays.
The Glee Club is formed of girls 
who wish to continue their voice cul
ture while at school. They are the 
best singers chosen from all four 
classes and they meet regularly under 
their director for study.
A student organization was formed 
last year to act in connection with the 
faculty committee to receive and de
cide upon all the requests on planning 
of charitable or social activities. This 
committee is comprised of the man
ager of the above mentioned organi
zations and the chairmen of the com
mittee on entertainments and dances. 
An auditor is also appointed to audit 
the accounts of this organization at 
the end of the year.
The Students organization on En
tertainments and dances is comprised 
of a member from each class and one 
from the student body as a whole. It 
is formed so that when any class or 
organization wishes to give an en
tertainment or dance it will be re
ferred to this committee to have the 
date fixed. This will simplify matters 
for the faculty committee on student 
activities.
Miss Stoner then spoke on the ex
tra classes which she and Miss East
man are willing to have for the Jun
iors and Seniors who do not take any 
other form of physical training. She 
is also going to organize a class of 
upper classmen to teach them the 
new popular dances. Then, any 
Thursday or Friday afternoon she is 
willing to take a class of girls to the 
Natatorium and give them swimming 
lessons. Her department is also going 
to teach the girls how to play tennis. 
Miss Stoner also urged the early form
ation of basket ball teams and offered 
her assistance.
Dr. Rodhl, our new resident physi
cian, spoke to the students about her 
work and offering to give them all 
the advice and help possible during 
the coming year.
Dr. Gill addressed the incoming 
students in particular by telling them 
how to get advanced credits in Phys
ics, Chemistry, Cooking and Sewing, 
Laboratory work and taking in their 
place Trigonometry, Geometry, 
French or German.
Miss Higgins gave the students a 
warning and a wish. The warning 
was that they should not let their 
good times interfere with their work, 
while her wish consisted of three 
parts, each beginning with an F. They 
were Fun, Friends and Fineness for 
all the time and in particular for the 
coming year.
Dr. Day spoke to the assembly 
about the work that his department 
hoped to accomplish this coming year 
and asked for the students co-opera
tion.
Miss Parry explained to the stu
dents about the new method being 
adopted this year in regards to the 
electing of certain subjects. She then 
told of the manner in which the 
Plebes have been divided for this year, 
finishing by reading their names and 
the division in which they were 
placed.
The school, led by Misses Stoner, 
Harrison and Webb, sang the Mar
garet Morrison round and gave the 
school yell.
The girls of the M. M. C. S. Dormi
tory have been entertained during the 
past week by two delightfully informal 
teas which have been given respect
ively by the Misses Lillie and Isabel 
Hoag in their rooms at the Dormi
tory.

saw the morning dawn, the noonday

Through her granddaughter as in

a sick day in all her long life. She 
is still able to easily walk about her 
immediate neighborhood when aided 
by someone to lead her, as she is 
nearly blind. In her earlier years it 
was her delight to go five miles up 
the valley on foot to the old San

great age and strength to her lifelong

The statisticians in University Hall 
have not yet been able to make a 
satisfactory estimate of the size of 
the entering class but they expect it 
to be about what it was last year. 
There seems to be a suspicion, how
ever, that the class of 1917 may not 
be quite as large as its immediate 
predecessor was. If this conjecture 
proves to be well-founded we shall 
have to hunt for the causes of the 
falling-off.
There is one interesting phase of 
the situation. President Eliot used 
to say that the success or failure of 
any college in competitive athletics 
with its neighbors had little or nciliing to do with the attendance of stu
dents at that college; that men were 
attracted to institutions of learning 
by something else than athletic vic
tories. In support of this statement 
he was able to show that during his 
term as President of Harvard College 
the number of students had greatly 
increased even at times when Har
vard had been regularly defeated in 
almost every kind of athletic contest 
with its closest rival in that field of 
activity. If it now appears, after a 
period of almost unprecedented suc
cess in football, rowing and base
ball, that the freshman class is small
er than it was a year ago, President 
Eliot may find in that fact additional 
evidence in favor of his contention.
But, whether or not victories on 
the field and the river influence men 
to go to Harvard, the Bulletin wants 
the athletic teams to win their fair 
share of contests with their rivals. 
There are many exaggerations and 
even abuses in intercollegiate ath
letics in America but they are be
coming fewer every year, and as long 
as Harvard competes with other col
leges a reasonable degree of success 
is to be desired.
CnLLSGS, !NE VAS PUBLICv
Two activities of the University 
call for special mention. The first 
is the establishment, in co-operation 
with the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology, of the School for Health 
Officers. As Dr. Rosenau, the direc
tor of the new school, says, its pur
pose is to train men to officer the 
public health militia. The curricu
lum contains about 80 courses, some 
in the Medical School, some in the 
Graduate School of Applied Science, 
and some in the Massachusetts Insti
tute of Technology; they include med
ical, biological, hygienic, and engi
neering topics. The need of such a 
school has long been felt. The co
operation between Harvard and the 
Institute of Technology will be of 
great advantage to the students in 
the school; practically everything that 
Boston and Cambridge have in their 
line of work will be open to them, 
and the resulting opportunities will 
be unequalled elsewhere in this Coun
try.
The L'niversity Extension courses 
are not new, like the School for 
Health Officers; they have been tried 
before, but they are none the less 
useful because the novelty may have 
worn off. Some people believe that 
the endowed universities have no spe
cial responsibilities towards the pub
lic. It is true, of course, that the 
institutions which are supported and 
carried on through the beneficence 
of their graduates and other indi
viduals do not have to answer to 
legislatures and hoards of trustees 
appointed by the state as they would 
have to if they depended on legislative 
grants of money; nevertheless, these 
colleges, which, to use the ancient 
word, are cherished by the state, are 
under a certain obligation which is 
not wholly satisfied by graduating 
men who are learned in the humani
ties or the sciences. Harvards parti
cipation in the University Extension 
movement, the Sunday afternoon lec
tures at the Medical School, and the 
numerous ways in which the Univer
sity is co-operating with the City of 
Cambridge show that Harvard is not 
trying to shirk its responsibility.
PEACE DECLARED.
(Continued from Page 1)
The festivities of the evening were 
concluded with the customary parade 
of the student body around the ath
letic field, who later formed the C 
from which the school cheers were 
given. Not to be outdone the fairer 
sex from the Womens School also 
joined in the parade, forming a small 
C inside of the large one. While 
the parade was in progress a bonfire 
of monotonous proportions was light
ed the material for which had been 
collected earlier in the day by most 
of the Plebe Class who escaped the 
disgrace of spending the greater part 
of Friday in the Design School dun
geon. Following the parade, refresh
ments were served, and my, how those 
Plebes did descend upon the refresh
ment committee! There were Plebes 
to the right of them, Plebes to the 
left of them, in front, and behind. 
They tore down the railing around 
the stand, and pushed, and pulled, and 
scrambled, and fought with one an
other, enacting in their haste the 
scenes that one sees at a bargain day 
sale at a nickle and dime store. They 
stuffed their pockets and themselves 
with sandwiches until they could hold 
no more, while those who were un
fortunate to arrive late devoured the 
baskets that they had been in.
The decorations of the field were 
exceedingly unique. From the roof 
of the M. M .C. S. two large search
lights played upon the field, furnish
ing an excellent illumination for the 
various events of the evening. The 
school band was there, also, and their 
presence seemed to put the finishing 
touches on the evenings entertain
ment. It is to be hoped that we will 
be honored by their presence at the 
football games this fall. On the hill, 
near the score board the initials blazed 
forth in red fire giving a very unique 
and fascinating setting to the scene.

When papas pride first set foot up
on Uncle Andys green soil he walked 
into the Registration Building with 
a firm and important tread. Mercy 
me! Who were those rude persons 
with those terrible looking cudgels. 
It took some time for the terrible 
truth to seep through their heads. 
While waiting for the Registration 
Board to call their number it dawned 
upon them that those aggressive look
ing beings were Sophomores.
Timidly coming from Room 104 
they were gently grasped by the arm 
and there their troubles began.
After investing in a covering for 
their brain box, and a Joshuary they 
were lead to a desk where Tartan 
Subscriptions were being sold. Here 
they showed their first spark of Car
negie spirit. Then, Horrors! They 
were led to the club room and swore 
by their great-grandmothers pipe to 
obey all the requirements of the Upper-classmen. Shedding their gaudy 
ties and Prep School pins, and turn
ing their coats inside out, they pro
ceeded to entertain the Human Beings 
of the school. Singing, dancing and 
drinking were indulged in to their 
little hearts content. Those cruel 
men even pee-raded them out into the 
dashing rain drops. Such carryings 
on lasted Monday and Tuesday. On 
Tuesday afternoon they entertained 
the spectators on the Campus. Wed
nesday morning the little things were 
marched downtown and forced to par
ticipate in the big parade. Thursday 
the boys broke their necks to attend 
classes and quite a few were real 
sports and ate in the beanery. The 
big event, however, happened Friday. 
Early in the morning some of the 
poor boys were practicing baseball 
down on the field when some naughty 
Sophs went down and told them to 
commence their manual labor by car
rying wood. The merciless Sophs lead 
them to the new Design Building and 
there they were pushed down into 
a d-a-a-a-rk and glo-o-o-my tunnel. 
Singly and by bunches they were cap
tured and by two oclock there was 
one hundred and twenty six trouserless, mad, hungry, indignant and wet 
(very wet, in fact, because a two-inch 
fire hose was used to keep them cool 
and in the dungeon under the theater) 
Plebes all nicely cooped up out of 
harms way. When the crowd as
sembled on the field to see the various 
feats of strength, thar warnt no 
Plebes. Then in order to show the 
public just how weak and feeble these 
incomers were they were released and 
after a scramble for their trousers 
they finally appeared and were so 
hopelessly snowed under that its a 
wonder they had the nerve to appear 
in the evening.
Now that the hatchet has been bur
ied and tradition has been kept up the 
Student Body accept the Plebes as 
true Sons of Carnegie and hope that 
they will bring honor to its name 
through scholarship and athletics. The
hard feelings, if there ever were any, 
are certainly all gone and the hazing 
which the incomers received will be 
something they will always remember 
and be proud of.
EDITORIAL NOTE:
The above is a Sophomores view of 
the affair, needless to say.
SOPHS SUSTAIN SUPREMACY.

the sprinters. In the Medicine Ball 
Relay, the Sophs obtained the lead in 
the first hundred yards and main
tained it to the finish. The Plebes 
were over anxious and fumbled the 
ball frequently. Many of the runners 
evidently misunderstood instructions 
and attempted to cover the entire dis
tance on a single spot. Several pro
ceeded reluctantly only after much 
coaxing from the side lines. The 
Fetch and Go-carry Relay was a very 
original race. It was productive of 
many striking illustrations of the Law 
of Gravity. Literally speaking, the 
teams were quite unbalanced. The 
Sophomores won by using the better 
judgment in the selection of their rep
resentatives. These two firsts added 
15 points to the latters credit and 
made the score 23 to 5.
The final five points were annexed 
in the baseball game, where the Plebes 
nevertheless, made their best show
ing. Their pitcher, Kuhmay, seemed 
to have lots of stuff. The only run 
of the game was made against him 
by Hines and resulted indirectly from 
an error. The Sophomores played 
their Varsity battery, Hines and Lane, 
with whom the Plebes could do noth
ing. The Plebes threatened to be
come rough when the Sophomores 
dictated to their third baseman the 
manner in which he should wear his 
hat, but Umpire Grotefend rose to 
the occasion and quelled the disturb
ance.
Though beaten by the one-sided 
count of 28 to 5, the Plebes were in 
no way disgraced. They have the op
portunity now to display their true 
spirit by taking their defeat in a 
sportsmanlike manner. If they do so, 
they need have no fear of their future 
welfare.

From the New York Tribune.
On the theory that small favors 
ought to be thankfully received the 
country will probably be grateful for 
the self-restraint which President Wil
son has exhibited in the recent re
assignments in the consular service. 
All the shifts ordered were made in 
accordance with the provisions of the 
executive orders which protect the 
consular service from1 political loot
ing. So long as these orders remain 
unrevoked promotions within the 
corps must be on the basis of merit 
and new appointees must enter the 
lowest rank.

From the blast furnace stock pile 
the ore is picked up by grab buckets 
on the ore bridge and loaded into cars 
on the furnace bins. Here it is 
weighed out by cars into the proper 
proportions with coke and limestone, 
according to the character of each, 
and dumped into skip buckets. The 
skips empty into the furnace about 
once a minute.
The furnace of today has a capacity 
of from five to six hundred tons. 
Casts are made every four hours, that 
is, there are six casts every twentyfour hours. From ninety to one hun
dred tons of iron are drawn out at 
each cast. The average blast pressure 
is from twelve to fifteen pounds per 
square inch. Samples of iron and 
slag are taken every cast and the char
acter of the slag noted between casts 
and the furnace regulated accordingly.
The furnace man has within his 
power the regulation of the stove 
heat, the air blown into the furnace, 
and the change of burden. Three 
chief products are charged into the 
furnacecoke, ore and limestone; 
three chief products come out of the 
furnaceiron, slag and gases.
Vrg Iobh DIdg Ihkb ,kggs, 
the iron from the furnaces is run 
into twenty-five to thirty ton ladles 
and from these poured into a pig ma
chine, after it has been weighed. Some 
of this iron is poured into twelve to 
fifteen ton ladles to be used as part 
of the charge for a Bessemer con
verter or the Open Hearth Furnaces.
The chief impurities of the iron are 
silicon, sulphur and phosporous. The 
object of the blast furnace is to reduce 
the ore, iron oxide, to the metallic 
state.
The ore after being converted into 
iron is made into steel by three dif
ferent processesthe Bessemer, the 
Open Hearth Process and the Cru
cible Process. The chief difference 
between iron and steel is the carbon 
content. Ordinary blast furnace pig 
iron runs about 3^4 per cent carbon, 
while in steel the carbon is far below 
1 per cent. High carbon is usually 
noted in pig iron by the formation of 
graphite which floats about the blast 
house. In this form the carbon is 
mostly uncombined carbon, while in 
the fine, dense, hard iron the carbon 
is mostly in the combined state.
Vrg BgttgCgo PobPgttv
In the Bessemer Process the small 
ladles of twelve to fifteen ton capac
ity are poured into a Bessemer Con
verter and a strong blast of air is 
blown through it. As mentioned 
above the main difference between 
iron and steel is to be found in the 
carbon content. In the Bessemer 
Process the oxygen of the air oxidizes 
the carbon and also part of the sili
con and phosphorous. The air enters 
at the bottom of the converter, pass
ing up into the main vessel through 
tile with twenty-one air passages in 
them'. These tile are placed in a re
movable bottom so that when unfit

for use the bottom may be changed.
The converter itself is shaped some
thing like an egg.
A blow lasts from ten to twelve min
utes. The character of the teel is 
noted by the characted ot Cue flame 
coming from the converter. At the 
beginning of the blow the color is a 
deep crimson, due probably to the 
oxidation of the silicon. The fine, 
bright yellow streaks of flame which 
begin to appear mark the beginning 
of the oxidation of the carbon. They 
gradually increase in size and num
ber until at best the maximum oxida
tion of the carbon takes place, after 
which they gradually decrease in in
tensity, finally dying down to the 
deep crimson of the silicon flame 
which marks the end of the blow.
The converter is then tilted and its 
contents poured into a larger ladle 
from which by means of a controllable 
stopper the steel is turned into ingot 
moulds, six, eight and ten tons in size.
The steel is allowed to stand in the 
moulds until it solidifies and it is then 
sent to the striping house where the 
mould is removed and the ingot placed 
in the soaking pits, where it is kept 
hot until ready for use.
From the soaking pits the ingot is 
lifted to a small transfer car, placed 
on the rolls, and there rolled into 
sheets, rails, blooms, wire and other 
various steel products.

The essential difference between the 
Bessemer Process of making steel 
and the Open Hearth Process is that 
in the latter the impurities are slowly 
oxidized down to the desired amount 
in a molten bath and then the steep 
tapped out, while in the former the 
impurities are oxidized almost entire
ly out by the blow, and the desired 
constituents added later, or the steel 
left as it is at the end of the blow.
Open Hearth furnaces vary in size 
and capacity from small eighty ton 
stationary furnaces to two hundred 
fifty ton tilting Talbot Furnaces. The 
capacity of stationary open hearth 
furnaces varies from thirty and sixty 
to ninety tons. Air and gas pass 
through checker chambers up through 
ports across the bath down through 
posts on the opposite side of the 
furnace through checker chambers 
and thence to the stack. The process 
is reversed every fifteen to twenty 
minutes to heat up the air and gas 
entering the furnace, and to utilize 
the heat otherwise wasted by going 
up the stack. The modern practice is 
to burn gas from a battery of gas pro
ducers, four to the furnace for Talbot

CLASSIFIED LIST OF TARTAN ADVERTISERS
We have classified our advertisers so that our readers may use the list 
for reference before making purchases. The grouping furnishes an excellent 
variety of merchants for any article which a student, alumnus or faculty 
member would be likely to buy, and there is no valid reason of which we are 
aware that would justify anyone interested in the welfare of The Tartan in 
making purchases from any but merchants who so kindly make such a publi
cation possible. Be sure, also, to give one of the purchase stubs, which you 
will find enclosed in your Tartan every other week, to the clerk from whom 
you make the purchase. The stubs, we have found, make pleased advertisers 
and help to get new ones. May we depend upon YOU to take this as a re
sponsibility to your Institution and to The Tartan.

METALLURGY

Furnaces, which are situated in close 
proximity to the open hearth furnace.
In the stationary furnace the full 
charge is tapped out at one heat into 
a large ladle and then teemed into 
moulds. When the steel has solidified 
the ingots are stripped and placed in 
the soaking pits. Before rolling the 
upper part of the ingot is cut off to 
remove the impurities due to piping 
or segregation at the top. As in the 
Bessemer Process the ingots are later 
taken from the soaking pits and 
rolled into rails, beams, plate and 
other steel products. The ends of the 
rails are also cut off and the rail 
stamped with the companys name 
and the date when made.
In the Talbot Furnaces the capacity 
ranges from two hundred to two hundrey fifty tons. The furnaces are 
therefore much larger than the sta
tionary type. The principles of oper
ation are exactly the same only that a 
part of the bath is removed at a cast 
while the entire bath is tapped out in 
the stationary type. From seventy to 
eighty tons are tapped out at a time 
into ladles. The chief advantage of 
a Talbot Furnace is that it is always 
hot, wrhile in the stationary furnace 
wrhen all the iron is removed the fur
nace cools considerably. A disadvan
tage of the Talbot process is the ex
pensive tilting machinery required to 
operate it. It is claimed by many that 
open hearth steel makes a better grade 
of steel; at any rate it has made rapid 
inroad on the Bessemer Process in late 
years.

The crucible process of making 
steel is used for the finer grades of 
steel, such as tool steels, scissors, cut
lery, etc. The chief difference be
tween this process and the two former 
processes is in the operation. It is 
carried out in small pots in a reverbatory furnace. The pots are made of 
crushed brick, clay and other infusible 
material. They weigh about forty 
pounds when empty and the charge 
consists of about one hundred pounds 
of metal, making a total weight of 
about one hundred fifty pounds.
These pots are lowered into the 
reverbatory furnace by means of 
large tongs. The great disadvantage 
of the process is the terrific heat. The 
covers of the furnace are removed, 
the pots are lifted by hand from a 
white hot furnace below. Very large 
and strong men are in demand for 
the work as few others can stand it. 
On lifting a charge the workers face 
is shielded by a wooden shield held in 
the teeth, and his legs are wrapped 
in burlap wet with water. He stands 
straddling the furnace and lifts the 
pots out with the tongs and pours the 
steel into small moulds.
As in the other processes when 
the steel has solidified it is thripped 
and the bloom or ingot rolled into the 
different raw steel products to be 
used in making the finer steels of 
trade.
There are many diverging minor 
steps leading to the various steel 
products of trade but the object here 
is merely to give a general idea of
TALES FROM CAMP.
The surveyors returned from camp 
on Tuesday/and were a rather dis
hevelled looking lot of men, to say 
the least. However, after having a 
shave, shine, shampoo, hair cut, and a 
Turkish bath, they once more began 
to harmonize with the present mode 
of civilization that is to be found in 
Pittsburgh. Like all men who have 
braved the dangers of the camp life 
of surveying parties, they, too, had 
many tales of adventure, hardship, 
and daring to tell.
Kirk, who, as you may know, be
decks himself with a baseball uniform 
in the spring, went to Freeport one 
rainy evening with his side partner, 
Stevenson, to visit, oh, well, let us 
say some relatives. Then entered the 
villain of the scene in the person of 
Headings, who stole his paddles from 
where they were hidden in the bushes. 
Kirk, upon returning to his canoe, 
spent a half hour or so in search of 
them, at the end of which time he 
much resembled a Plebe after an im
mersion in the foundry tank. Noth
ing daunted the aforementioned gen
tleman, who paddled the mile from 
Freeport to camp with his hands. He 
claimed that it only took him 35 
minutes but from the best sources of 
information it was later learned that 
kirk's voice could be heard in the dis
tance for at least an hour before he 
reached camp. What he said is not 
printed because of lack of letters in 
the alphabet with which to express it.
Kirk also invented a portable stove, 
and it is lucky that it was a portable 
one, too, for it gave off so much gas 
and smoke that it kept him busy most 
of the time putting it out of the tent. 
Someone aptly remarked that he man
aged to keep warm trying to make 
his stove burn.
Straw hats were outlawed on Sep
tember 15th, it being decreed upon 
that day that all hats in camp should 
be immediately set upon and lynched, 
so to speak. This was done with all 
the vigor and enthusiasm of the days 
of 49. That is the reason that Abe 
Martin came home with a bandana 
tied around his noble brow.
Who stole Pringles collar button? 
That is the great mystery of the camp. 
It caused him all kinds of inconven
ience and embarassment, and it is ru
mored as the result he had to fasten 
his collar in place by means of a piece 
of string, which slipped when he was 
tying it, but unfortunately did not 
strangle sufficiently to cause him to 
depart to warmer regions.
It was with a great feeling of relief 
that the student body learned that U.
S. Scott, who was injured while swim
ming at camp, is progressing rapidly, 
and will be able to leave the hospital 
by the middle of the week.
