TECH SCORES GREAT VICTORY. 
PITT BEATEN IN OWN MEET.
Saturday, May 20, 1911, will be remembered for 
a long time by Carnegie Tech students. The results 
of the Pitt Inter-Collegiate meet have shown that 
the schools have the best track team in their short, 
but eventful history.
In only three events on the card, Tech was left 
without a place, and the significant point is that the 
half-mile race was the only track event of which 
this was true. Gilkinson set the pace for threequarters of the distance but was passed on the 
stretch. The time for this distance made by Hubbell of Western Reserve, was two seconds faster 
than the Western Pennsylvania record.
Three records for Tech athletes were sent by the 
board, which is itself a record for the day. In the 
one mile run, Captain Wait broke the record held 
by W. C. Bates, 09, which was 4:52 3-5, by going the 
distance in 4:44 3-5; Boots in the running broad 
jump, beat the mark of 20 feet set by A. L. Griffith, 
09, by three inches; and the relay team, consisting 
of Crawford, Sperry, Gilkinson and Steinmetz, won 
in 3:34, which is 2-5 second faster than the time 
made by the team composed of Ross, Bates, Charles 
and Hosey. In the quarter mile, Steinmetz traveled 
in : 513-5, falling short of Hoseys record by 1-5 
second. Wait again beat F. H. Wylies time for the 
two mile, but failed to reach his own mark of 11:
10 3-5 set in the West Virginia meet.
Leavenworth, a Western Reserve man, scored three 
first places for his college, while his teammate, Hubbell, secured the other five points scored. The only
two winners for Pitt were Rosenthal and Galvin in 
the 220-yard dash and the shot put. Captain Bry
son, touted as an inter-collegiate star, scored one 
third and one fourth place.
The relay race, the last of the track events, 
was the sensation of the meet.. Pitt crowded our 
men until the last eighth of the third quarter and 
then was left behind. Another close contest was 
for third place in the one mile run. Miller showed 
an unexpected amount of stamina and passed his 
man in a determined spurt on the stretch, winning 
by a narrow margin.
The score for Tech was made by the following 
men: Steinmetz, 10%; Wait, 10; Crawford, 9*4; 
Boots, 5; Miller, 2; Decker, 2; Criswell, 2y2; Roessner, 2; Sutherin, iy2; Gilkinson, 1%; Sperry, 1%; 
McCrory, 1. Total, 48 points.
The Collegiate score was: Tech., 48; Pitt, 37 1-6; 
Westminster, 20y2; Grove City, 20 1-3; Western Re
serve, 20; W. & J., 18; Geneva, 1.
Pittsburgh High won the Interscholastic meet with 
64 points, followed by Kiskiminetas Springs School 
with 37 points. Five interscholastic records were 
broken.

TENNIS TOURNAMENT.
During the past week, the different matches in the 
Tennis Tournament have aroused quite an interest 
among the faculty and student body. A number of 
the matches have been very long and hard fought. 
Owing to the excessive heat, several of the players 
have had more or less trouble with men ^rhom they 
would otherwise have defeated easily.
In the first round, the match between Tea and 
Myers was hard fought, Tea finally winning, 8-6, 3-6 
6-2. Both men played a careful game, and took few 
chances till the last set when Myers seemed tired 
out and Tea took the advantage and won. Manker
and Miller had another long match, Manker losing 
the first and winning the next two sets.
In the second round, Douthett played a much 
stronger game against Duff than the score shows. 
Tea seemed to have his troubles with long matches, 
losing to Clements 7-5, 3-6, 9-7; a total of 37 games 
being played many of which went to deuce. Clements 
serve worked well and he took good advantage of 
his opponents weak points. Flood had a close run 
when he played Sterling, the Pride of the Design 
School. Sterling played a good game and had Flood 
up against it several times, especially in the last 
set. Hunter played a good game against Manker 
when he won 2-6, 6-4, 6-1. The result came more or

less as a surprise, as Manker started out strong, but 
did not last. Hunter has several peculiar strokes 
which are confusing and which went hard with Lef
tys Lawford stroke.
Owing to a bad racquet, Clements did not put 
up his usual good game against Duff in the third 
round. In this round, Hunter defeataed McWilliams, 
thus bringing the tournament to the semi-finals. 
Duff then defeated Hunter 6-2, 6-0, giving him a place 
in the finals. Beeken lost a well played match to 
Flood 6-4, 6-3. Beeken has played a good consistent 
game throughout the tournament and should develope into a much stronger player with good prac
tice.
The tennis team will be picked from among those 
fellows who have made the best showing in the tour
nament, and not necessarily from among the men 
who reach the semi-final or final rounds.
On Friday the 26th, the tennis team will take a trip 
to Washington, Pa., where W. & J. will be played. 
This will be the first trip taken by any tennis team 
representing the schools, and it is hoped that a good 
showing will be made. Four men will be taken, but 
at the present time it is not known definitely what 
men will be eligible to go.
BETHANY DOWNS TECH.
Although the local nine scored two runs in the 
first inning, and Urquhart would not allow a man to 
look at first until the third round, the hot weather 
was too much for Carnegie Tech, and the final score 
was 8 to 3 in favor of Bethany.
Smith and Umbenhower fanned in turn. Riggs 
sent an easy one to Gearhart, who threw to first, re
tiring the side.
Vail was hit by the pitcher and advanced on a 
sacrifice by Brine. Humphrey singled and Riggs threw 
home, hitting Vail on the ankle as he crossed the 
plate. The ball rolled away and Humphrey scored. 
Saunders struck out, and Gearhart sent a fly to Um
benhower.
McLain started the second inning by striking out. 
Bradford sent a sizzling hot one just across the sec
ond base, but Gearhart scooped it up on the run and 
sent it to first ahead of the Bethany man. Harmon 
hit to Brine, and was thrown out at first.
Bethany scored three runs in the third; and one 
in the fourth, with two each in the sixth and eighth.
Moorehead replaced Urquhart in the sixth but 
could not stop the scoring of the last two runs.
The errors made by the locals were all of a cost
ly nature, but their hits were scattered and mainly 
ineffective. ^The game was the poorest played by 
the Plaid nine.

C.] E. MEETING A GREAT SUCCESS
The annual reception in honor of the Plebe Civils 
last Saturday evening proved a great success.
Many of the night men were present as were hon
orary members, Dean Leete and Prof. L. B. Smith.
Previous to the reception several talks of a techni
cal nature were given. President Witte made the 
opening address. Prof. H. R. Thayer made the ad
dress of welcome to the plebes. Mr. G. A. Bell spoke 
upon the Johnstown Flood. Mr. H. W. Dougherty 
spoke upon The Destruction of a Conveyor Bridge, 
and finally Prof. M. E. Mott lectured upon his recent 
visit to the Panama Canal Zone with a delegation 
from the American Society of Engineers.
At the conclusion of his address Prof. Mott wel
comed the plebes to his department. In conclusion 
he spoke of last years reception and of the pleasure 
we had had from talking over the then recent track 
meet between the classes of the Civil Department. 
He spoke of the regret occasioned him that no such 
meet had occurred this year; and as a stimulug to
ward athletics in the Civil Department he presented 
the civil department with a trophy to be won by one 
of the three classes in competition. The department 
received it enthusiastically and fully appreciate the 
effect it max have upon athletics.
After the lecture the men proceeded to become 
mutually acquainted and launched upon one of the 
most pleasant evenings of the year. A buffet lunch

6THE TARTAN
was served in the instrument room. After' the lunch 
and while the majority of the men proceeded to 
make the air blue but fragrant, Mr. McCall called 
upon a number of men for impromptu toasts. At 
the height of the evening the light went out. The 
toasts were finished by lantern light and proved a 
fitting close to a successful evening.
Several members of the Mandolin Club were pres
ent and did much to enliven the evening. The So
ciety takes this opportunity to thank them.
Announcement as to the department track events 
will appear at an eraly date.
FREEPORT CONCERT
All Glee and Mandolin men report at the East Lib
erty station next Thursday evening at a time which 
will be posted on the Bulletin boards. In order that 
no classes will be missed on the last day of school, 
arrangements will be made so that the clubs may 
come back the same night. This concert is import
ant on account of the proximity of Freeport to Camp 
Carnegie and the establishment of relations with our 
neighbors.
XI SIGMA UPSILON DANCE
On Thursday evening, May the eighteenth, Xi 
Sigma Upsilon gave their second annual dance in 
the Bellefield Club. Unusually warm weather de
tracted but little from the pleasure of dancing, in 
which thirty couples indulged. The hall was at
tractively decorated in college and fraternity pen
nants.
The dancing began at nine oclock after a recep
tion of half an hour, at which every one was made 
acquainted. At midnignt, following an extra supper 
dance, a lunch was served the guests in the parlors 
of the club. Dancing was later resumed until two 
oclock, when the Alma Mater fittingly concluded the 
music of the evening. Nirellas orchestra could as 
usual be given only words of highest commendation.
Prof. and Mrs. Work, Prof. and Mrs. Lightcap and 
representatives from other fraternities of the school 
were the invited guests who assisted in making the 
evening enjoyable and successful.
BASKET-BALL.
Basketball was inaugurated this year after two 
years of inactivity in this sport. The season was a 
success, even though the team lost most of the games 
on the trips. Practically all the home games were 
won,- including the home game with Pitt. The team
had a schedule of seventeen games with different col
leges and universities in the surrounding territory.
Many good men were developed, including, Jordan, 
Keltz and Saunders who were picked as some of the 
best college players in this section of the state. All of 
last years team expect to return to school next fall, 
excepting ex-captain Jimmie Williams. Next years 
team under Captain Slivers Williams is expected to 
clean up the championship of Western Pennsylvania.
Manager George S. Blair has corresponded with a 
number of schools for next years schedule, including 
Pitt, Allegheny, Marietta, Bucknell, Muskingum and 
Westinghouse Engineers. A western trip is being 
arranged on which some of the fastest colleges in 
Eastern Ohio will be played.
SPRING FOOTBALL PRACTICE.
Carnegie Tech began preparation for next years 
football season by holding practice last week. About 
a dozen or fifteen men reported last week on Wed
nesday and Friday, and held short practice in kick
ing, passing and throwing the ball. The size of the 
squad was materially reduced by the football men at 
present on the baseball and track squads. Among the 
men of iast years team who reported were Captain 
Taylor, Roessner, Blair, Engstrom, Mandeville, 
Schmucker and Blanchard.
Practice will be held on Monday, Wednesday and 
Friday afternoons until further notice.
Preliminary fall practice will probably start at 
Camp Carnegie about September 1st, if proper ar
rangements can be made.
1911 Football Schedule
Manager James K. Lamoree of the Football Team 
has been working hard on the new schedule, and has 
practically, completed the engagements for 1911. 
There are several new teams on the list and while 
the nine games scheduled do not call for some of 
our friends such as Lehigh, the teams represented 
will all play good football. The Rensselaer Poly
technic Institute is a new foe on the schedule which 
should prove a very popular attraction.

THE TARTAN7
THE MAY FESTIVAL.
The first May Festival given by the Margaret Mor
rison School was held on Friday, May 19, on the 
court beside the school building. The event was in 
charge of the Dramatic Club, but all the girls in the 
school either took part or helped with the prepar
ations. The plan for the occasion was originated by 
Miss Stoner, who also trained the girls for the songs 
and dances.
The plot included the return of Spring after the 
retirement of Winter; then, in honor of the Princecess Spring, and joy at her return, her subjects pre
sented their songs and dances.
Winter first appeared on the scene, driving in the 
frost elves for a last look over the world which he 
had ruled so long. All their efforts to turn back the 
course of time being fruitless, they were accosted by 
old Father Time himself, who emphasized the futil
ity of struggling against him, and consoled unhappy 
Winter. After the sad departure of Time, with Win
ter and the Frost Elves, the sparkling North Wind 
swept over the scene, but was soon chased away by 
gentle, alluring South Wind, who left the grateful 
earth ready for the approach of Spring.
Then, preceded by white-clad flower laden maids 
of honor, and followed by the attendants, came the 
Princess Spring, gracious, sweet and lovely.
After being crowned by Mary Wight, President of 
the Dramatic Club, the Princess Spring watched 
from her throne the happy revels of her subjects. 
Each dance was requested by the Princess and an
nounced by her charming herald.
The first dance was most appropriately that of the 
flowers, and was given by girls selected from the 
Senior and Junior Classes.
The Princess Spring wished to see dances typical 
of the different nations, so the English lasses were 
bidden to enter. They came on in pink dresses and 
sunbonnets and danced the jolly English dance. This 
was followed by the Morris Dance, in which six 
Plebes took part with great cleverness.
Spanish Senoritas next filled the court of Spring. 
Two most pleasing dances, La Tzagane and the 
Cupid Dance, were presented by the Junior Class. 
The Seniors danced the Jota to the click of the cas
tanets, and the red and yellow costumes added fur
ther to the Spanish Spirit.
The Emerald Isle was not forgotten, and the Irish 
Dance by the Plebe Class met with hearty approval.
After a couple of songs in honor of the Spring, 
there was swift descent made upon the court by vis
itors from the Sunny Peninsula, who danced the Tar
antella.
Of course, the Princess could not be pleased with
out her bonnie Scotch lassies, and on they marched 
to the music of the bag pipe. The Highland Fling 
seems to be especially our school dance; the Seniors 
had the honor of presenting it. Immediately follow
ing the fling was the Scotch Reel, which brought the 
dancing to a close.
The different nations having been represented, the
Princess Spring, with her full court of attendants and 
subjects around, called for an emblem of our best 
loved country, and after the stirring notes of the 
bugle had sounded, Sarah Nolen, Senior Class Pre
sident, presented the American flag, and the sing
ing of the Star Spangled Banner ended the Festival.
The audience was large and enthusiastic. Little 
sisters and brothers were numerous, as were also 
the snap shooters. The girls were pleased at the 
interest shown by all their friends and were glad 
to note the presence of Mrs. Paterson and her daugh
ter and of Dr. Brashear.

ATHLETIC VIEWS.
While it is true that the future is a land of dreams, 
the present a place of hard reality, and the past a 
graveyard of departed hopes, it profits us occasion
ally to pause and look backward, that we may mark 
our progress, enjoy our benefits, and dream sane 
dreams. At the close of another school year, the sixth 
in our career, we might well turn our thoughts to our 
athletic achievements.
In college life, the out-door sports form a neces
sary part of the course. Relaxation of mind and de
velopment of body must be cultivated for a success
ful career. This has been recognized in the Depart
ment of Student Health in the Schools.
On the athletic field, Carnegie Tech has so far 
stood for clean sport, rather than for phenomenal 
conquests. It is true that one year may see a win
ning team in some sport, and the next a team so 
handicapped as to be able to accomplish little. But 
the indomitable spirit has never faltered, and is now 
a by-word among our adversaries.
The football team of 1910 was composed of light 
men, mostly new to the schools. The schedule was 
hard and we lost the majority of the games.
Basketball was resumed after a cessation of a year. 
A light, but fast team, was developed and a number 
of hard games won. The majority of these were in 
the new gym, showing that a home floor is a valu
able asset.
With good prospects for a successful season, base
ball was started early in the season. The first two 
games were prevented by rain. With six games to 
play, the team is constantly improving, in spite of 
the fact that a coach has not been secured.
Better things may be said of the track team. West 
Virginia was swamped in a dual meet; our men won 
the Pitt Intercollegiates; and school records are be
ing ruthlessly broken.
As part of our prospects for next year, we hear 
that the Department of Student Health has been 
augmented by the addition of a permanent coach for 
all sports. Who this will be is still unsettled, but 
Tex Ramsdell, the Penn star, is a possible choice. 
As another change, a resident physician, Dr. Marks, 
has been appointed. This insures medical treatment 
and advice to the students of the three mens schools 
at any time.
The Carnegie Farm is also a factor in our future 
athletic life. There the students may enjoy out-door 
life in all varities. There a training camp will be 
established for the football team, And there the poor 
wornout grind may be sent into retirement to 
breath decarburized ozone, that he may return a new 
man.
In addition, the teams will be left almost intact by 
graduation, and each should have a nucleus about 
which may be built successful teams.
FUTURE SOPHOMORES N. B.
It seems fitting at this time to speak a word to 
next years Sophomores in regard to the customary 
treatment and discipline of the Plebe. Every school 
has its own way of opening the eyes of Freshmen 
to the position they hold. This is generally done by 
means of rules regulating conduct and dress laid 
down by the Sophomores. In some schools, the wear
ing of bright neckwear and hosiery is prohibited; in 
others, the doffing of the Freshmans mark of dis
tinction, to the faculty and all Sophomores, is re
quired. Such rules, when enforced from the start, 
are obeyed as by instinct, later on.
At Carnegie similar rules have been established. 
To illustrate: the idea of the Plebe cap was origin
ated by the present Junior Class. Their means of 
enforcing this measure being a lame appeal to jus
tice in the presence of the strangers. The present 
Sophomores enforced this in a more business like 
way and also introduced many a novel way of wel
coming their future friends. Now it would seem that 
it is up to future Sophomores to enforce all past cus
toms, with any improvements in any way they see 
fit,. and introduce a custom of their own devising, 
to represent their class in years to come. Further, 
remember that rules laid down and not enforced 
count for Plebe superiority.- The question now is 
What will your addition be?
There was a man in our town and he was wondrous 
wise.
Financial schemes brought him a roll that was of 
goodly size;
But when he busted up a bank with all his might 
and main;
The Jury sadly shook their heads and murmured, Hes 
insane.Ex.

THE TARTAN9
PATENTS FOR INVENTIONS
Feeling that matters pertaining to patents is of in
terest to every technical student, the Tartan here
with publishes a lecture given by Mr. Christie, the 
famous patent lawyer, to the students of the School 
oi Applied Science last Thursday.
It will be given in two instalments, the second in
stalment will be printed in the next issue of the 
Tartan.
It is not the purpose, nor would time permit me, to 
enter into any extended discussion of what is called 
the Patent Law. My purpose is simply to outline 
to you in a very general way, but I trust clearly, 
what is proper subject-matter for a patent; how a 
patent is obtained and some of its essential incidents 
and characteristics. In so doing, it may be nec
essary to touch in a general way upon some wellestablished principles of patent law, and a statement 
of these will at least help to an understanding of 
the subject.
The grant of Letters Patent for inventions is now 
a well established institution with all civilized na
tions. The part which this legal reward given to in
ventors has played in the development of human in
dustries and human comfort in the last century can 
hardly be appreciated. It is evident in every walk 
of life, and needs no illustration.
It might, of course, be safe to assert that even 
without any patent system we would still have had 
with us many of the distinguished investigators, the 
fruits of whose researches have so greatly enriched 
human knowledgethe modern successors of men 
such as Newton, Farraday and Professor Henry. But 
it is equally safe to say, that were it not for the 
reward which the patent laws are intended to pro
vide, the world would have benefited to only a rela
tively inconsiderable degree from the genius and 
labor of that great and constantly growing class of 
men, fitted by natural talents or education, and us
ually both, to pluck from the realms of scientific in
vestigation and to practically utilize, in material 
form, for the production of wealth and the benefit of 
mankind, the forces and principles provided by na
ture.
Similarly also with another necessary member of 
our commercial organization, the capitalist, manufac
turer, or active producer. He could hardly be expected 
to expend his money and effort in the making, adver
tisement and marketing of something new and use
ful, only to lose the bulk of the profit which he would 
naturally and reasonably expect to derive from his 
own farsightedness and business energy, through 
the competition of others to reap where they had 
not sown.
With an enlightened appreciation of the vast ad
vantage to the public at large of an adequate re
ward to inventors, it was provided in the organic law 
of our government, the Coistitution of the United 
States, that
Congress shall have power * * * to pro
mote the progress of Science and the Useful Arts, 
securing for limited times, to * * * Inventors
the exclusive right to their * * * Discoveries 
Surely among the highest purposes of human 
governmentto promote the progress of Science 
and the Useful Arts, the arts of peace, progress and 
natural prosperity  the purpose of which your 
distinguished founder has dedicated not only this in
stitution, but others already known and hereafter to 
become still more famous for their good works.
Following the adoption of the Constitution, Con
gress proceeded to pass the first patent act. Its pro
visions have since been improved, enlarged and clar
ified, and it now provides, in substance, that any one 
who shall invent any new and useful art, machine, 
manufacture or composition of matter, or any new 
and useful improvement thereon, may by due appli
cation and after conforming with certain require
ments, obtain Letters Patent securing to him, and to 
his heirs and assigns, for the term of seventeen 
years the exclusive right to manufacture, sell and 
use his invention.
Thus we have the essential subject-matter of a 
patent defined, namely, an art, a machine, a manufac
ture, a composition of matter, as well as an improve
ment upon any of these subjects.
The term ART is more properly understood as 
meaning a method or process of producing or attain
ing a useful result. Many examples will occur to 
you. For instance, the Bessemer process of blowing 
air through molten iron, thereby removing from the 
iron the silicon and carbon naturally contained in it, 
and then recarburizing the product and thus convert
ing it into steel. The process of producing alumi
num from its ores. The process of making glass 
jars, by pressing the article with a finished mouth 
and a depending hollow blank, and then blowing the 
blank to form the body. A process of generating 
heat, by passing an electric current through a body 
of granular resistance material. Dozens of illus
trative processes might be cited. In fact, a patentable art, that is, a patentable method or process, has 
been well defined as consisting in an act or series of 
acts performed upon a substance to be reduced or 
transformed to a different state or thing. That defi
nition sums it up as well as any.
And this being the nature of a patentable process, 
it will at once be apparent to you that the machinery, 
tools or appliances by which the process may be 
carried on have nothing to do with the process itself. 
It matters not what be the mechanical means em
ployed to carry out or to assist in carrying out a 
patentable process, so long as this process itself is 
practiced it is covered by the patent, however the 
tools may be varied.
Some limitations upon a patentable process have 
been suggested, and first it is often heard in common 
speech that a principle or a natural force cannot be 
covered by a patent. Properly understood, this is 
true. But it is equally true that the practical utiliza---------------------------------------------------

10THE TARTAN
zation or material application, of a principle or natu
ral force by some particular means or in some par
ticular way, to attain a useful result, can be pro
tected by a patent. This may be illustrated by a 
comparison of two now historic patents, both in the 
same art.
Professor Morse in his patent for the electric tel
egraph made a variety of claims by which he under
took to cover and protect his invention. Among 
others was one which, roughly stated, was in some
what the following language:
I do not limit myself to any particular method or 
means for generating and utilizing the electric cur
rent, but what I claim is the use of the electric cur
rent however generated, for reproducing or printing 
signs at a distance.
The Supreme Court of the United States, when this 
case came before it, held that this claim was too 
broad, that Professor Morse had therby endeavored 
to cover broadly the use of the electric current, a 
natural force, for all purposes of telegraphy, no mat
ter how generated, or how utilized, and the claim 
was therefore void. At the same time it is a satisfac
tion to note the Morses invention was sufficiently 
protected by his other claims which were held to be 
valid, the question of the validity of this particular 
claim only being important on the question whether 
or not he could recover the costs of his suit.
The other case, which lies on the other side of the 
line, is that of Bells telephone patent. In this case 
Bell claimed, in substance, the exclusive right to the 
use of a continuously flowing but undulatory electric 
current, for transmitting sounds and reproducing the 
human voice. This claim was held valid. It covered 
the utilization of the electric current in a particular 
way; and when it was objected that the effect of this 
claim was simply to cover the use of the electric 
current for that purpose broadly, because a contin
uously flowing undulatory current was the only way 
in which the human voice could be reproduced, the 
Court replied that that was no objection, but if true 
was so much the better for the patent.
Anoher  suggestion has been made, that a party 
cannot, under the guise of a patent for a process, 
claim the mere function of a machine. That is, as 
the homely illustration has been put, He cannot 
claim planing a board. I am not ready to agree to 
such a statement. If planing a board were new, I 
see no reason why it might not be patented. Cases 
in which assertions of this character have been made 
are those in w'hich the question was really whether 
or not the inventor had produced something new. 
That is, the inquiry was really whether or not inven
tion was present. So this so-called proposition, as 
is usually the case with catch-phrases, really serves 
only to confuse and not to clarify.
Hence, we have as a patentable art, any new and 
useful act or series of acts by which a new effect is 
produced or a substance acted upon is transformed 
or converted into a different state or thing.
The next subject of a patent, a MACHINE, of 
course, needs no definition here, nor does a manu
facture, that is, an article of manufacture. In some 
cases these two subjects overlap. That is, we can 
often think of a tool which one would probably de
scribe as an article of manufacture, and at the same 
time, because it operates actively, might also be 
called a machine; but this is merely a matter of 
words.
Compositions of matter which are patentable will 
also readily occur to you. Such for example as cel
luloid, new chemical compounds like carborundum, 
high-speed tool steel of some particular composi
tion, and generally all composite substances which 
are in point of fact, new.
Finally, any new and useful improvement on any 
art, machine, manufacture or composition of matter 
may be patented by the improver. Note that when 
the improver gets his patent, that gives him no right 
to use the thing improved, provided the latter is 
covered by a patent still in force. His patent only 
covers the improvement. He cannot use the thing 
improved without the consent of the patentee of that 
thing, nor can the patentee of the thing use the im
provement without his consent.
Now just a word as to the qualities of patentable 
subject-matter. The Act of Congress provides that 
the invention must be new, and that the invention 
must be useful.
The question of novelty is probably one which has 
worried the Courts in patent litigation more than 
any other. For it is not everything that is new 
merely in form that can be patented. It must be 
substantially new, and the test doubtless is whether 
or not its conception or production has amounted to 
something more than, over and above, what may be 
termed the expected skill of the alleged inventor in 
the craft or art to which the invention relates. It 
does not matter whether or not the invention is new 
with him in point of fact, that is, whether or not he 
did conceive of it originally and without any pre
vious information. The question is the situation of 
the publicwhether or not the invention was already 
in the knowledge or in the possession of the public. 
If it was, then it is not patentable, whether the in
ventor himself knew of the previous disclosure to 
the public or not.
It is well established that a mere change in form 
proportion or degree, or the substitution of one ma
terial for another, whereby a machine is merely 
made stronger, or more workmanlike, or more at
tractive does not constitute patentable invention. 
That, as you will see, falls within the scope of engi
neering skill. The designing and construction of 
machinery is part of the professional work of the 
engineer. Invention calls for another faculty, what 
we may almost say is a natural faculty, as distin
guished from knowledge acquired by education. It 
is where this faculty is exercised that invention, 
exists.

---------------------------------------------------

THE TARTAN11
Probably the most difficult questions of patentable 
novelty which arise are those which involve more or 
less directly the adoption in some particular art of 
a machine, tool, or expedient already used in another 
different art, for accomplishing a somewhat similar 
purpose.
Where the arts are more or less closely allied, so 
that it can easily be said that the transfer of the 
thing from one art to another could not possibly 
have involved invention, that is, where what the 
inventor has done amounts merely to a double or 
analogous use, there is no room for a patent.
On the other hand, where the arts are only remote
ly allied, or perhaps widely different, and where the 
expedient or mechanism in its new use has brought 
about a new result in that art, or a more valuable re
sult, and particularly if the transfer from one art to 
another. has involved changes in the expedient or 
machine, there would be proper subject-matter for a 
patent. These rules are only generally stated, and 
necessarily so, but they will give you an idea as to 
the considerations to be weighed in determining 
such questions.
The other requirements of the Statute, that the 
invention shall be a useful one, need detain us only 
a moment. This means absolute usefulness, and not 
relative usefulness, that is, it is not required that 
an invention, in order to be patentable, shall do its 
work better than what has previously been known, 
but only that it shall be capable of accomplishing 
that result claimed for it, so long as that result is 
not harmful to the public or merely frivolous.
(To be concluded)
TO THE JUNIORS.
Judging from the elaborate arrangements that 
chairman Pete Stirling of the Senior Ball com
mittee is making for the Senior Ball, the affair at 
the Rittenhouse this year will eclipse previous af
fairs of this kind. Contrary to precedent the ball is 
open to the Juniors this year, and it is to be hoped 
that there will be a good representation from them. 
As is generally known, the Senior Class is small this 
year due to the changing of the former 3 year course 
into a four year course and it will hardly be possible 
to make the affair pay without enlisting the aid of 
the Juniors.
The hearty cooperation given by the Seniors to the 
Junior Prom warrants some cooperation being given 
in return and Mr. Stirling is relying upon this aid to 
make the affair pay. So get busy, Juniors, and get 
in on it. We need your cooperation.
The date of the affair, June 6, has been selected 
so that the final exams will not intefere with it.
POSITION OPEN.
We have a position for a Tech man with ability 
and character. The work is in the city and suburbs. 
The pay depends on the man. Call Johnson's Studio, 
5th Avenue, City.

BANQUET AT HOTEL HENRY
On Wednesday evening May 10, fifty members of 
the First year night class held their First Annual 
Banquet at the Hotel Henry. The menu was elabo
rate and well gotten up with an appropriate toast 
for each item. The cards were decorated with the 
school colors and were tied with cord of Applied 
Science blue.
After the feast, the toastmaster, Mr. J. A. Lonergan 
took charge of th affair and an interesting program 
of impromptu speeches and toasts followed. Music 
by the class quintette and orchestra, with a few 
class and school yells, filled in the time at opportune 
moments.
Before the evening was over much class and school 
spirit had been aroused and each one present felt 
that this banquet had drawn the members of the 
class closer together and had inspired in them a 
greater feeling of friendship.
The banquet committee was composed of L. A. Sny
der, M. E. Smith and S. W. Koenig, who deserve 
much credit for the excellent manner in which they 
conducted the affair.

ATHLETIC JOTTINGS.
Carnegie Tech 1914 baseball team won a game last 
Saturday with Pittsburg College Reserves by a score 
of 5-3.
The varsity plays W. & J. at Washington, Pa., on 
Saturday, May 27. On Memorial Day the team will 
be seen at Indiana, Pa., where they will play two 
games with the Normal.
We are informed by the executive offices of the 
schools that the appointment of Fred L. Ramsdell as 
General Coach of Athletics for the next school year 
is almost certain. Mr. Ramsdell was born in Texas, 
educated at the Uiversity of Texas and the Univer
sity of Pennsylvania in Civil Engineering and has for 
a number of years represented the University of 
Pennsylvania in various branches of athletics. He is 
the holder of the worlds record for one hundred 
yards; he has for several years played on the Uni
versity of Pennsylvanias football team, is an ex
cellent basketball player and is thoroughly familiar 
with the methods of Mike Murphy in the all-round 
training of teams.
His appointment to the Department of Student 
Health, of which he will become a part, will great
ly strengthen that department by his services as 
chief coach of all branches of intercollegiate com
petition, in most of which Mr. Ramsdell is an ex
cellent performer with a thorough mastery of the 
fine points of the games.

FIRST EXPEDITION TO CARNEGIE CAMP.
The graduating Senior Class will establish a .pre

days.
It is expected that the majority of the class will 
go the latter part of this week.
The program to be followed there has not been 
announced but it can be said that a large part of the 
time will be spent in obtaining a genuine rest.
It is to be hoped that the camp will be ready in time 
for their coming.
CARNEGIE CAMP NOTES.
The Tartan learns that the young ladies in the 
vicinity of the camp, particularly in Freeport, belong 
to the peach variety.
Superintendent Henderson does not fancy the kind 
of advertisement given him in last weeks issue.
The black and white cow on the farm became the 
mother of a nice calf the other day.
The various clubs and frats are making arrange
ments to spend a week or two camping during the 
summer.
The camp has certain historic features. Quite a 
number of the early settlers had their homesteads 
on its site. There is a cairn or pile of stones which 
marks the spot where a homestead once stood which 
was razed to the ground by the Indians who mas
sacred the occupants.
The grass of a certain part of the camp is being 
cut short to permit of baseball being indulged in.

Tired of reading,
Tired of writing,
Tired of copying and editing,
And the bed looked so inviting 
As though charming me to sleep,
That I folded up my paper,
Carefully extinguishing my taper,
And softly to my bed did creep.

Soon I fell into a slumber,
With no nightmares to encumber 
The blessings of my rest.
When a sound beneath my windows 
Knocked my dreaming all to flinders, 
Burned my visions all to cinders 
So that I got up and dressed.
Such another horrid squalling 
And infernal caterwalling 
Was never heard before that night. 
All the Tomcats in creation,
Seemed let out upon probation 
And were scratching like tarnation 
In an everlasting fight.
Hastily I raised the sashes,
And made divers frantic dashes, 
Hurling pans of red-hot ashes 
On the brawling brutes below. 
Quickly ceased the infernal chatter 
And having settled thus the matter,
I again to bed did go.
But if I should live forever 
I am sure that I could never,
More forget that I could never,
More forget that awful fright 
Which came oer me on awaking 
And my soul with fear was shaking 
On that eventful Thursday night.
Ex.
