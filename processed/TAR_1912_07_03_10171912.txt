P WAYNESBURG EASY VICTIM
Downed 25 to 0
-=
The first home game of the foot
ball season resulted in a decisive vic
tory for Carnegie Tech. The Plaid 
eleven entirely outclassed the Waynesburg team and won easily by a score 
of 25 to 0. Of course, we expected 
a victory, and the common opinion 
was that we could score four touch
downs, but the ease with which the 
game was won was a surprise to al
most everybody. The first team was 
given a good workout, then, in the 
last five minutes, the second team was 
sent in to show their ability.
The day was bright anc warm 
enough to make the spectators com
fortable. A steady breeze blew up 
the field causing-some uncertainty in 
forward passes and in punts, but not 
enough to iryterfere seriously with 
the game. The rooters were numer
ous, and in good voice. For the 
first attempt, the rooting was excel
lent and gives promise of some noisy 
times later in the season. It is to 
be hoped that cat-calls and irregular 
cheering will always be as noticeable 
by their absence as on Saturday.
Metheny and Park are the only play
ers who consistently and particularly 
distinguished themselves over the 
good work of their teammates. The 
former was used often and seldom 
failed to advance the ball, and had 
two long runs of 35 yards and 45 
yards respectively to his credit. Park 
was on the receiving end of two for
ward passes that netted long gains 
and resulted in placing the ball with
in scoring distance. Almost every 
one of the other players pulled off 
some stunt that made them deserving 
of special mention.
The formation of interference was 
one of the details that helped the 
scoring upward. Each back that car
ried the ball was given protection and 
could not fail to make a gain. The 
defensive work of the linemen was 
also a considerable factor, for, to all 
of the onslaughts of the Waynesburg 
backs, the line held like a wall, and 
the visitors made first down but 
twice. Excessive eagerness resulted 
in a number of penalties in the first 
half for holding. These, with one or 
two for offside play, were the only 
penalties inflicted, and were entirely 
eliminated in the final periods.
Pauley was the only successful 
ground-gainer for the visitors, for
Pipes was not given a chance to show 
his wonderful speed except in one or 
two instances. The Greene county 
boys were game but never had a 
chance. In the final period, just be
fore the second Tech team was sent 
in, the visitors all showed almost 
complete exhaustion, while the Plaid 
player swere apparently still fresh.
The details of the game follow:
First Quarter.
Hummell kicked off to the 10-yard 
line; the Waynesburg halves fumb
ling, and the ball being stopped three 
yards from their goal. Spinning 
gained 1 yard, and Hill added another. 
Pauley punted to Metheny on the 35- 
yard line, the latter returning 5 yards. 
Park added 8 yards, but Metheny fum
bled on the next down, Stonerod re
covering with a loss of 10 yards. 
Metheny went around left end for a 
run of 25 yards, placing the ball on 
Waynesburgs 5-yard line. Hummel 
was held for no gain. Park went 
through center for 1 yard, and gained 
3 more on the next down, stopping 
1 yard from a score. Park fumbled 
in the next scrimmage, and Waynes
burg recovered. Pauley kicked out 
of bounds on the 20 mark. Park, 
aided by a splendid interference, ran 
through the visitors for the first 
touchdown. Methenys kick-out es
caped, Score: Carnegie 6, Waynes
burg 0.
 Hummel kicked off to Pipes on the 
goal line, and he returned 10 yards 
before being downed by Hummel. 
Pauley kicked to Metheny who was 
stopped on the 40-yard line. Mont
gomery broke through and tackled 
Metheny for a loss of 3 yards. Hum
mel regained this distance on a line 
plunge. A forward pass, Metheny 
to Park, netted 25 yards, stopping at 
the 15 mark. Hummel gained 3 yards, 
and Park 8. Hummel was downed 
with th.e ball a scant foot from the 
goal line, then Park was sent overfor the second touchdown. Methenys kick from placement failed. 
Score: 12-0.
Pauley kicked off to Park on Car
negies 25-yard line, the ball being re
turned 10 yards. The quarter ended 
with the ball on our 35-yard mark. 
Score: Carnegie 12, Waynesburg 0.

FLOOD!
Many Lives EndangeredDean Leete 
Risks His Life.
On Friday about 11:45 A. M. a 
great explosion rended the air of 
the Science Building, followed by a 
mad rush of waters that came down 
the stairways like a veritable Niag
ara, flooding the first and second 
floors of the building. Many hurried 
to the scene of the disaster, but some 
of the mechanics and hydraulic en
gineers to be of the Senior Civils 
were plowing their way through the 
great torrent in order to reach the 
source and stem the tide.
A large part of the second floor 
was flooded, especially the office of 
the English Department. After much 
struggling, Professor Doyle reached 
a point of safety on the window sill, 
and Mr. Long with great exertion 
was able to reach the back of a chair. 
Mr. Collins, the new English instruc
tor, proved the hero of the office by 
perching himself upon the back of 
a chair and attempting to keep the 
water out with a broom.
The stairway leading to the third 
floor was filled with the rescued and 
onlookers who lent succor to their 
friends in need. The Dean came forth 
from his office to fight the torrent. 
He managed to quiet the rescued 
ones and console those who had lost 
their beloved friends in the mad on
slaught of the waters.
The cause of the great flood was a 
bursted radiator. The water was half 
inch deep.
After the excitement was over and 
the hunkies were sweeping the water 
down the steps, one of the venerable 
members of our faculty, who was on 
his way up stairs, managed to re
ceive a mouth full of water from the 
janitors brooms. This occasioned an
other outpouring of water, combined 
with words.

ON TO WASHINGTON.
On to Washington is the slogan 
for the week, for every son of Tech 
is going on that special on Saturday. 
Only six hundred rooters are need
ed, and from all indications, this num
ber will be doubled. Word has been 
coning in from Alumni and from 
former students giving long lists of 
rooters who are bound for Washing

scriptions, but all with the slogan, 
On to W. & J. are plastered over

THE DIRECTORY.
Last week the new school directory 
made its first appearance, but for 
some unknown reason we have re
ceived notice of very few omissions 
and corrections. As stated before, 
the object of this directory is to be 
a complete list of the officers of the 
several classes and activities, but this 
information is impossibple to com
pile without the co-operation 'of those 
concerned. For instance, why have 
not the members of the Civil Club, 
the Fulcrum, the Mho Club, etc., come 
forward with a list of their officers? 
If you are interested in some of the 
activities, see to it that they are rep
resented in the Directory.
---------------o-------------
MHO CLUB.
The first meeting of the Mho Club 
will be held in Room 121, Science, on 
Wednesday evening, October 16, at 
8 P. M. This being the first meeting 
of the year, officers will be elected. 
The Sophomore Electricals are es
pecially invited.

THE SQUIRRELS.
First Senior Club at Carnegie Tech.
The first Senior club at the school 
was perfected the other evening and 
will be known as The Squirrels (why 
the name we are unable to say, but 
we have our suspicions). There were 
many plans gone over and future 
activities discussed at the meeting. 
However, definite action was taken 
in regard to a class hatthis adorn
ment will be seen for the first time 
at the W. & J. game on Saturday. 
The entire membership will be there 
in full array. Following are the of
ficers elected by the club: President,
H. Franks; Secretary, Wm. Nuzum; 
Manager, Dan Curtain; Treasurer, 
Walter Jones.

THE BULLETIN BOARDS.
Several times during the course of 
the last collegiate year The Tartan 
called attention to the condition of 
the bulletin boards in the corridors 
and urged that an effort be made to 
keep them in a presentable state. It 
is with no pleasure we note that 
even now, at the beginning of a new 
year, the condition of the boards is 
such as to make it next to impossible 
to find the desired bit of information 
for which you are looking. The dis
order of the notices on the boards 
is as bad now as it was at any time 
during the year past, the only differ
ence being that all the posted infor
mation is more up to date than it was 
then.
The matter of keeping these boards 
neat, it seems to The Tartan, rests 
with the students. The bulletins are 
placed on the walls for the conven
ience of the students at large and they 
should show their appreciation by 
seeing to it that the boards are in 
a presentable condition always. Some 
censorships should be exercised over 
the matter in and the form of the 
notices before they are posted, thus
getting away from the present slap
dash method of allowing any person 
to write any notice on any kind and 
any size of paper which he may see 
fit to use and tack it on the boards. 
After the notices are once up, it re
mains for the students to show their 
spirit by seeing to it that the notices 
so posted are not defaced, and that 
the condition of the boards remains 
neat. It is unfortunate that attention 
must be called so early in the season 
to so unpleasant a matter, but The 
Tartan trusts that the necessary re
form may be forthcoming, and that 
nothing further need ever be said on 
the subject of bulletin boards.

MOREWOOD AVENUE EXTEN
SION.
At the coming election there are 
several appropriations for city' im
provements to come up for a vote 
of the people. The most important 
from the Carnegie Tech point of view 
is that for the extension of More
wood avenue from Forbes street to 
Woodlawn avenue. It reads as fol
lows: $180,000 to pay the citys share 
of the damages and expenses result
ing from the extension, opening, 
grading, paving, curbing and other
wise improving Morewood avenue, 
from Forbes street to Woodlawn ave
nue.- Think what this extension
would mean to all who go to Tech! 
How much closer it would be to the 
car lines. If you are a voter, vote 
for this appropriation, by all means. 
If not, talk it among your friends 
and persuade them to vote for it.

While it is yet early in the season, 
it is not by any means too early to 
congratulate the Football Team on 
their past performances, holding
State to practically half of. last years 
score and walloping Waynesburg
speaks well for the remainder of the
season.
With the W. and J. game only two 
days off, each man in school should 
make a desperate effort to do his
share toward bringing home a vic
tory. No team can play as good a 
game without any encouragement 
from the side lines, as it can if there 
are six hundred men watching them 
to cheer each play.
Notices have been posted and meet
ings have been held, but unless each 
man makes it his business to get 
busy, buy his ticket, and go to Wash
ington, our team will not have the 
encouragement they deserve.
Get busy, the team needs you.

DIED.
On October 12th, Fred A. Schmuck
er, Jr., of the Class of 1909, School 
of Applied Science, died of typhoid 
fever, after a short illness, at his 
home in Ben Avon, Pa.
Mr. Schmucker was born on Feb
ruary 21st, 1889, in Allegheny. He at
tended the Ben Avon Public Schools 
and the Allegheny High School, and 
entered Carnegie Tech in September, 
1906. During his attendance here he 
was one of the most popular men in 
his class; he played on the football 
eleven in the fall of 1908, and partici
pated also in several other student 
activities.
After graduating in June, 1909, 
from the course in Civil Engineering 
he worked for several months as 
draftsman with the Cambria Steel 
Company in Johnstown, Pa.; later he 
spent nearly a year in the open hearth 
department of the Jones & Laughlin 
Steel Companyfirst as helper and 
later as foreman. At the time of his 
death he was a steel inspector for 
the R. W. Hunt Company in Chicago, 
111.
His many fine personal traits had 
endeared him to students and faculty 
alike, and it was with the keenest 
sorrow for their own loss, and the 
sincerest sympathy for his bereaved 
family, that his friends at Carnegie 
Tech learned of his death.

MUSICAL CLUB SMOKER AT 
THE FORT PITT.
The Carnegie Musical Clubs offici
ally launched their 1912-13 season last 
Friday night with a smoker and re
ception to the new men. Fresh from 
success in initial tryouts the pros
pective members entered into the 
spirit of the evening from the start. 
The members of former years led 
by President Crawford, reviewed old 
songs and, best of all, the famous
1910-11 varsity quartette was pres
ent. They sang several former pieces 
and gave some brand new ones. Hogdon, accompanied by the strumming of 
a guitar sang his masterpiece My 
Sunshine Rose. Cornwall with 
Bring Salvation Down and an as
sorted collection of funny verses 
helped the good time along.
After eats came the speeches all 
of which were to the point. A trip 
was discussed and a possible route 
for Easter was mentioned. Johns 
Hopkins in Baltimore may arrange 
for a joint concert and if so an ex
tended trip northward is planned.
From year to year the Musical 
Clubs have shown a decided improve
ment and this year will be no ex
ception. The new men are going to 
give some of last years members a 
hard run for their places. The music 
too is even of a higher quality than 
last year, which is saying a great 
deal.
---------------o---------------
WHITE FRIARS ORGANIZED.
Getting away to a flying start for 
the new season, the White Friars 
held their first meeting last week, out
lined plans and elected officers. Judg
ing by the spirit shown at the meet
ing, the success of the coming season 
is insured. A few of the graduate 
club, who were present, guaranteed 
the aid of that body in the next pro
duction, and the undergraduates 
pledged themselves to work for the 
biggest show in the history of the 
Friars.
Coach Edmundson gave a detailed 
review of last years show, pointing 
out the defects and enumerating a 
few of the reasons for its success. 
He gave other authority than his own 
for many of his statements, although 
belief in his competency is a part 
of the creed of the Friars. He out
lined plans for the new year, asking 
for an early call for candidates, in 
order to relieve the strain of prepa
ration. All of his statements and re
quests were met by hearty promises 
of co-operation.
The club elected the following of
ficers:
H. C. Franks, DesignPresident.
J. A. Cameron, ScienceFirst Vice 
President.
L. W. Andrews, DesignSecond 
Vice President.
D. J. Curtin, Ind., Treasurer.
W. Jones, Jr., Design, Manager.
J. W. Savage, Science; E. A. Wil
son, Ind.; R. M. Crawford, Science, 
and W. J. Corbett, Science, Board of 
Governors.
BIG THISTLE.
Have you considered that the 
Thistle Board is getting busy? This 
may seem premature but to make 
this years Thistle eclipse them all 
it is imperative that we start work 
at once. The Board needs material; 
so get busy. It is especially import
ant that the Junior classes, both day 
and night, all schools, elect their his
torians so their class histories may 
be complete. Now all together

TEN DAYS IN A BAR-ROOM.
Yes, this is M. M. C. S. news, but 
it doesnt sound like it. Have you 
noticed the bar-room, girls? It isnt 
a really bar-room, you know, it is 
only the Senior locker-room with the 
swinging door effect. Some of last 
years juniors came back as Tri-Sen
iors and received their lockers, as is 
customary, in the Senior lockerroom.
And then Professor Hutchinson and 
Director Hamerschlag got busy and 
converted most of us to the Fouryear course. This means that most 
of us who were Juniors last year are 
Juniors again and so we very quietly 
Oh, so quietly, removed our books 
and paraphernalia, and left the bar
room effect and moved down to the 
laundry.

DESIGN PLEBES ORGANIZE.
On last Tuesday at noon, amid 
scenes of wildest confusion, there as
sembled in Room 117 of the new De
sign building, the Plebes in Architec
ture ( Arch, in particular, for the rea
son that the Plebes in 111. and Dec
orating refused to join them. The 
supposition is, they considered them 
as inferior to their classical tastes). 
Tucker called the meeting to order 
and engineered the election of the 
president. On account of his classi
cal looking physique S. P. Stewart 
was elected unanimously to pilot the 
organization through its destinies for 
the year 1912-13. After the applause 
from his enlightening speech had sub
sided, a mighty battle waged for the 
position of vice president. On the 
eighth ballot, L. M. Weld was given
the decision. T. M. Stonerod, of this 
years varsity squad, was chosen over 
Watt as secretary. Simpson was 
shown to be the victor over Spiegel 
and Blum in the race for treasurer. 
A great deal of heated discussion 
arose as to whether any of the men 
were responsible for this position of 
trust. It was finally agreed that all 
should run, each promising to give 
bond if elected. Carl C. Manchester 
was given the position of Tartan 
Representative. After the meeting all 
promised to give their support in any 
undertaking the class might under
take. This means a whole lot, as 
many social functions are now under 
discussion. A complete schedule of 
these events will be published later. 
Meanwhile the entire Institute is 
asked to keep their eyes on the School 
of Design.
---------------o---------------
REGISTER OF GRADUATES.
The first register of graduates to 
be published by the Institute is now 
in press and will be issued shortly. 
It will include the names, class, course 
and present home and business ad
dress of all graduates of the four 
schools from 1908 to 1912.

During the past summer, the Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing 
Company of East Pittsburgh, had an 
interesting group of men on their pay 
rolls. They consisted of thirty col
lege professors, from the engineer
ing departments of colleges from 18 
states, who donned overalls and 
worked at the regular apprentice 
wage. The purpose was for the study 
of the methods used in such a plant 
and in order to better understand the 
conditions under which their pupils 
would work. The company placed a 
special instructor at their disposal 
and the evenings were given over to 
inspection tours and lectures.

and noise is more than fashionable, 
as long as the tune remains On to 
Washington.
The defeat of W. & J. by State to 
the tune of 30 to 0 last Saturday has 
boosted the odds in Carnegie Techs 
favor. Where only the most opti
mistic predicted close scoring after 
the Indians left Washington, now 
every voice is proclaiming, We are 
bound to win. And the chances 
are we will, if the team is given the 
support of a record crowd of root
ers, rooting in the famous Carnegie 
Tech spirit.
Whether any one else goes or not, 
the band will be on the train. This 
means melody and a big parade 
through Washington. The band made 
a hit at Cleveland last fall, and are 
out for a boost from Washington. If 
things arent lively on the trains both 
ways, as well as just before and dur
ing the game, it wont be the fault 
of the big bass drum.
A special representative from the 
P. R. R. will be on hand Thursday 
afternoon from 3:30 to 5:30 P. M. to 
sell railroad tickets. Arrangements 
have been made to take care of night 
students during the evening of the 
same day. The tax is $1.25 for the 
round trip. The fare by street car 
is $1.00 for the round trip. An ad
mission of 30 cents to the game will 
be charged. So the maximum expense 
is $1.55, within the reach of every
body. The train will leave at 1:15 
P. M. City time, with the crowd on 
board arriving about 2:15.
You will get your moneys worth 
in fun and excitement, and you will 
help the team win. Now is the ap
pointed time to get in on the plans; 
next Monday will be too late, and 
you will be sorry if you missed it.

A New Office in the Design School
If you will take a walk through 
the new Design building, starting at 
the basement and ending on the roof 
you will see many new and strange 
things, that is strange to all but the 
architects and nothing is strange to 
them.
On the fifth floor next to the 
roof you will find a number of little 
booths along the window side of a 
long, low ,slant-ceilinged room. Each 
booth has a low shelf on which to 
rest a drawing board. It is here that 
the students will take their esquisseesquisses, and the preliminaries for 
the Paris Prize will be held.
Now step outside to the room un
der the skylights and you will see 
a boardwalk or sort of balcony run
ning past the windows of the booths.

obstructed by a five-dollar bill. He 
patrols the length of 'the balcony 
and though apparently half asleep, 
he sees everything. And woe betide 
the unlucky student who should hap
pen to stray from his booth. With 
a swift swoop, Justice will descend 
upon him and there will be mourn

of the land.
We are not exactly sure yet who 
will be awarded the position of Massier, but think it probable that the 
honor will fg.ll on Hughey, our worthy 
stretcher maker. Of course he will 
go right on making stretchers just

course, is an individual petitioned by 
the faculty to do guard duty during 
the Paris Prize, or some other Prize, 
preliminaries. In order to make sure 
that each student remains in his own 
booth and uses his own peculiar ideas 
the massier must walk back and forth

alumni is M. L. Haas and the secretary-treasurer, O. S. Heck. Between 
meetings, affairs are looked after by

THE ALVIN THEATER.
An engagement which gives every 
promise of being the most success
ful musical comedy event of the cur
rent season will be the appearance of 
Eva Tanguay, the most popular com
edienne on the American stage, at 
the Alvin Theater for the week be
ginning Monday, October 21st, as the 
star in Lew Fields latest and most 
spectacular musical entertainment 
The Sun Dodgers.
It is hardly necessary to dwell at 
length upon the peculiar talents of 
Miss Tanguay, who shares with 
Maude Adams the distinction of be
ing one of the two most popular 
women now playing on our stage. 
Her eccentric methods and unflagging 
liveliness find abundant outlet in the 
role of Praline Nutleigh, Winter Gar
den favorite, in The Sun Dodgers. 
She will sing at least five new songs 
and wear as many of those bizarre 
costumes for which she is famous.
With Miss Tanguay will be seen 
George W. Monroe, the most absurd
ly ridiculous low comedian now ap
pearing in this country, last seen here 
with The Never Homes.  Mr. Mon
roe will appear as a wealthy widow 
from Butte and will have as a foil 
that other master of low comedy, 
Harry Fisher, with whom he was so 
successfully associated in The Midsnight Sons. Another prominent 
member of the cast will be Belle
Blanche, the dainty singing comed
ienne and mimic, recently a headliner 
in vaudeville. Others prominent en
tertainers in the company are Nat 
Fields. Harold Crane, Denman Maley, 
Jerry Hart. Maud Gray and Nan 
Brennan.
The piece will be staged with that
lavish disregard for expense which
has characterized all the Lew 
Fields shows and the scenes will 
be peopled by more than three score 
girls. The company will number more 
than a hundred.

A NEW AMERICAN POET.
William Chase Greene, son of Prof.
H. E. Greene, a Rhodes scholar from 
Massachusetts, is the first citizen of 
the United States to win that much 
coveted Oxford distinction known as 
the Newdigate prize for English 
verse, which he secured with a poem 
on the subject of Richard I Before 
Jerusalem. The English press speaks 
well of the production. The founder 
of this famous annual prize for poe
try was Sir Roger Newdigate, who 
died in 1806, and was a scholar of 
considerable excellence. A glance 
through the list of winners during 
the more than a century since the es
tablishment of this prize reveals the 
fact that the honor has been secured 
by very few who have subsequently 
risen to great eminence in the field of 
letters*. It is worth while, however, 
to be placed in the same class with 
such men as Principal Shairp, Dean 
Stanley, Dean Milman, F. W. Faber,
John Ruskin, Matthew Arnold, John 
Addington Symonds and Edwin Ar
nold.

The students of Carnegie Techni
cal School, Pittsburgh, had a big 
celebration last week at the open
ing of their new athletic field. It is

made possible by a liberal gift of 
Andrew Carnegie. The class fights 
were held on the day of its opening. 
Appeared in the Allegheny College 
Campus.

OBEYING ORDERS.
Seamen are strict disciplinarians, 
and a ships crew seldom even dreams 
of interpreting a commanders orders 
otherwise than literallly. One of the 
recognized rigid type was a certain 
English captain. The way the strict 
letter of his law was observed aboard 
his ship is described by a writer in 
the London Telegraph.
One day, while the ship was in a 
certain port, the captain gave a din
ner to some town acquaintances, and 
as the resources of the ship were not 
great, some of the sailors were dep
uted to wait on the table to re-en
force the insufficient number of stew
ards.
As these men were not used to 
such work, each one was told exactly 
what service would fall to his share.
The hour came, and the dinner went 
merrily on. Presently, however, one 
of the ladies wanted a piece of bread. 
There was none near her, and the 
finely disciplined stewards seemed to 
be quite blind to her need. She 
turned her head and spoke softly to 
the man at her elbow.
Bread, please, she said.
He looked regretfully at the bread 
and then at her. It was evident that 
he would fain have helped her if it 
had been in his power. He saluted 
in fine naval style.
Cant do it, maam, said he. Im 
told off for taters.

BRAVE.
Were you frightened during the 
battle, Pat? asked a sergeant of an 
Irishman who had received his bap
tism of fire.
Not a bit, sor, replied Pat. Oi 
can face anything when Oi have me 
back to it.Selected.
---------o---------
WASNT THAT KIND?
Now, look here, sir, exclaimed the 
gamekeeper imperatively; didnt you 
see the notice at the end of the road, 
Pedestrians not allowed?
I did observe a notice stating that 
pedestrians were not allowed here, 
replied the mild-mannered gentleman 
readily; but, you see, Im a Congregationalist.
Oh, indeed, returned the game
keeper, slightly puzzled; then I sup
pose its all right, sir. You can walk 
on.
FAMILY FACTS.
It was little Flossies first day at 
school. Her name had been regis
tered and the teacher asked: Have 
you any brothers or sisters?
Yes, maam, answered Flossie.
Are you the oldest one of the 
family?
Oh, no, maam, returned Flossie. 
Pa and Mas both older'n me.---------o---------
GIVING IT AWAY.
A woman just cant keep a sacret, 
he declared, opposing a statement.
Oh, I dont know, contradicted 
the fluttery lady. Ive kept a secret 
ever since I was twenty-four. 
Yes, he replied, but one of these 
days you will give it away. In time 
you will simply have to tell it.
Well, she replied, with confi
dence, I think that when a woman 
has kept a secret for twenty years 
she comes pretty near knowing how 
to keep it.Public Ledger.

Uncle HiWall, Jeptha, when air 
you a-going ter fix that fence along 
the creek?
Jeptha HollerWhy, Im waiting 
till Clarence comes home from col
lege. Ysee hes taking fencing les
sons there and probably he kin put 
me onter a new wrinkle or two.
BLIND, BUT FAR-SEEING.
A poor blind woman in Paris, we 
are told, put twenty-seven francs into 
a plate at a missionary meeting.
You cannot afford so much, said 
one.
Yes, sir, I can, she answered.
On being pressed to explain, she 
said: I am blind and I said to my
fellow straw-workers, How much 
money do you spend in a year for oil 
in your lamps when it is too dark to 
work nights? They replied, About 
twenty-seven francs. 
So, said the poor woman, I 
found that I save so much in a year 
because I am blind and do not need 
a lamp, and I give it to shed light 
to the dark heathen lands.---------o---------
THE MORE DIFFICULT TASK.
Professor Peabody of Harvard re
lates that he recently preached in a 
large city some distance from his 
home and at the close of service a 
young man whom he had known well 
in the university, a member of the 
latest class of graduates, came for
ward to greet him.
In answer to the professors natur
al question the young man said he 
had found work as a reporter on one 
of the city dailies.
Well, I trust you are advancing 
rapidly, said the professor. By this 
time I suppose you are fully equal 
to reporting anything from a dog 
fight to a sermon.
Well, answered the young man 
somewhat dubiously, the city editor 
has sent me here to report your ser
mon, but I hardly think hed trust 
me with anything in the line of a 
fight.

SIMPLE SOLUTION.
The bluff, cheery optimism of the 
late Senator Frye, said a Lewistown 
divine, could not brook a whiner. 
Once at a dinner here in Lewis
ton, a whiner seated opposite Sena
tor Frye said dolefully:
 I have only one friend on earth 
my dog.
 Why dont you get another dog? 
said Senator Frye.

EQUIPMENT.
Other things demanding our atten
tion at the beginning of this school 
year, we have, in the early issues of 
The Tartan, neglected to mention 
some of the changes and improve
ments which have been made in the 
School of Applied Industries during 
the vacation season.
In many departments new equip
ment has been added, much to the 
satisfaction of the instructors as well 
as advantage to the students, and in 
most all recitation rooms all availble space has been utilized in caring 
for the large classes which report to 
those rooms.
The Machine Shop, in charge of 
Mr. Hepburn and his staff, has been 
overhauled during the summer, and 
is now equipped with two lecture 
rooms practically sound-proof from 
the machinery without and with a 
seating capacity of fifty students each. 
The shop is so laid out and the ma
chines so arranged that should the 
occasion arise, Mr. Hepburn and his 
assistants would be able to care for 
one hundred and twenty-five or more 
students at one time.
A new addition to the Pattern Shop 
is a lecture room having a seating 
capacity of fifty students. The room 
is opposite the Pattern Shop and has
been partitioned so that one apart
ment may be used as a store-room for 
patterns, moulds, tools, etc., used in 
demonstrating, while the other is a 
general lecture room. In the near 
future Mr. Pfouts will equip his room 
with a lantern by means of which 
he can illustrate his lectures with 
slides.
The Foundry in charge of Mr. 
Dosey has been equipped with a 
crane made by the Brown Hoisting 
Machine Co. Cleveland, O., which 
will convey a load of two tons to 
any part of the ground floor. The 
hoisting is done by motor, but the 
Armstrong machine is necessary to 
change the position of the crane along 
the tracks.
During the latter part of last sem
ester, Mr. Taylor added to his equip
ment in the Forge a pyrometer, im
ported from England, which will reg
ister accurately heats up to 3000 de
grees Fahrenheit, and 1800 degrees 
Centigrade. This instrument is simi
lar or possibly of the same construc
tion as those used in all up-to-date 
mills and drop-forging plants, and is 
considered a necessary addition to 
Mr. Taylors department in regulat
ing the temperatures in the furnaces 
which were installed last year.
The Mechanism Laboratory, Room 
121, has been moved to the room on 
the third floor, formerly used by the 
Sign-painting Department.
These changes and additions to the 
equipment are all indicative of the 
growing popularity of the Carnegie 
Institute of Technology, and from 
authentic reports we are able to say 
that the Trade School of this insti
tution ranks with the highest and best, 
in rcspect to equipment, of any Tech
nical school in 'tie United States.---------o---------
LIFTS BAN ON FOOTBALL.
The Fordham university faculty, fol
lowing the example set by Holy Cross 
and Georgetown a couple of years 
ago, announced that it had lifted the 
ban against football and that the grid
iron game will hereafter be recog
nized as a varsity sport. The attempt 
to revive football at Columbia has 
again failed. Although the intercol
legiate rulemakers have endeavored 
JtO^<,make the game safer President 
Butler retains his former attitude. 
Fordham dropped football in 1909 and 
Columbia in 1905.

HOW MANY APPLES DID ADAM 
AND EVE EAT?
Some say Eve 8 ancl Adam 2a 
total of 10. Others say Eve 8 and 
Adam 8 alsototal, 16. But if Eve
8 and Adam 82, the total is 90, while 
if we figure that Eve 81 and Adam 
82, the total is 163. Eve surely 81 
and Adam 812, so the total should be 
893. If Eve 811st and Adam 812, is 
not the total 1623? But Eve 814 
Adam, and Adam 8124 Evetotal, 
8938. Again, if Eve 814 Adam, and 
Adam 81242 oblige Eve, the total 
must be 82056. This, however, does 
not seem sufficient, for though we 
admit that Eve 814 Adam, if he
8181242 keep Eve company, the total 
is 8082056. All wrong. Eve, when 
she 81812 many, and probably felt 
sorry for it, but her companion, in 
order to relieve her grief 812. There
fore, Adam, if he 81814240fy Eves

8THE TARTAN
THE RELATION OF THE 
HORSEPOWER TO THE 
KILOWATT.
(Abstract, Circular of Bureau of 
Standards No. 34, issued June 1,
1912, by the Department of Com
merce and Labor, Washington.) 
There was, before 1911, no precise 
definition of the horsepower that was 
generally accepted and authoritative, 
and different equivalents of this unit 
in wratts are given by various books. 
The most frequently used equivalent 
in watts, both in the United States 
and England, has been the round 
number, 746 watts; and in 1911 the 
American Institute of Electrical En
gineers adopted this as the exact 
value of the horsepower. It is obvi
ously desirable that a unit of power 
should not vary from place to place, 
and the horsepower thus defined as a 
fixed number of watts does indeed 
represent the same rate of work at 
all places. Inasmuch as the pound 
weight, as a unit of force, varies in 
values as g the acceleration of grav
ity varies, the number of foot-pounds 
per second in a horsepower accord
ingly varies with the latitude and al
titude. It is equal to 550 foot-pounds 
per second of 50 degrees latitude and 
sea level, approximately the location 
of London, where the original ex
periments were made by James Watt 
to determine the magnitude of the 
horsepower.
The continental horsepower, 
which is used on the continent of 
Europe, differs from the English and 
American horsepower by more than 
1 per cent, its usual equivalent in 
watts being 736. This difference is 
historically due to the confusion ex
isting in weights and measures about 
a hundred years ago. After the met
ric system had come into use in Eu
rope, the various values of the horse
power in terms of local feet and 
pounds were reduced to metric units 
and were rounded off to 75 kilogrammeters per second, although the orig
inal English value was equivalent to 
76.041 kilogram-meters per second. 
Since a unit of power should repre
sent the same rate of work at all 
places, the continental horsepower 
is best defined at 736 watts; this is 
equivalent to 75 kilogram-meters per 
second at latitude 52 30' or Berlin. 
The circular gives tables showing the 
variation with latitude and altitude of 
the number of foot-pounds per sec
ond and of kilogram-meters per sec
ond in the two different horsepow
ers.
These values, 746 and 736 watts, 
were adopted as early as 1873 by a 
committee of the British Association 
for the Advancement of Science. The 
value, 0.746 kilowatt, will be used in 
future publications of the Bureau of 
Standards as the exact equivalent of 
the English and American horse
power. It is recognized, however, 
that modern engineering practice is 
constantly tending away from the 
horsepower and toward the kilowatt. 
The Bureau of Standards of the De
partment of Commerce and Labor 
and the Standards Committee of the
American Institute of Elecrical Engi
neers recommend the kilowatt for use 
generally instead of the horsepower 
as the unit of power.

CARNEGIE INSTITUTE 
OF TECHNOLOGY.
Teachers Courses in the Margaret 
Morrison Carnegie School 
for Women.
With the intention of meeting the 
needs of the women teachers in the 
public schools, the Carnegie Institute 
of Technology is offering courses at 
the Margaret Morrison Carnegie 
School designed to prepare public 
school teachers for their requirements 
to secure certificates; also, courses 
for which credit towards degrees will 
be given.
The administration has endeavored 
to give the teachers of the Pittsburgh 
and Allegheny County Schools a wide 
scope of subjects and the greatest 
elasticity of choice, hoping to adapt 
the courses to their actual wants. It 
may be said that an evening course 
may be obtained in practically any 
subject offered by the institution on 
application from ten or more teach
ers.
Heretofore the evening classes at 
the Margaret Morrison School have 
been held but three nights in the 
week. This year the school will be 
open every night and Saturday morn
ings, a plan which will enable the 
teachers to get much help along the 
lines demanded by their daily work, 
as well as opening to them an op
portunity to begin work for degrees. 
It is believed that this desire to ful
fill their needs and further the inter
ests of the public school teacher will 
be appreciated.
The bulk of the work for teachers 
will be given on Tuesday and Thurs
day evenings and on Saturday morn
ings, although all of the evening 
courses are open to them. The spe
cialized instructors of the day faculty 
will have charge of the night classes, 
and full credit will be 'given for all 
work that meets the best standards 
and requirements. The method of 
determining credit units is similar to 
that in the day courses,one period 
a week for one semester carries one 
credit unit. *
The Department . of Household 
Economics is offering as special work 
to the teachers, Food Selection, the 
Chemistry of Foods and Cooking and 
Dietetics.
The Dress and Costume Economic 
Department has courses in Sewing, 
Textiles, Pattern Drafting, etc.
The Home Arts and Crafts Courses 
is offering instruction in Primary 
Manual Training, Drawing, Clay Mod
eling and the Elements of Design.
In the Sciences, work is scheduled 
in Biology, Physics and Chemistry.
In Pedagogy, courses are offered in 
Psychology and History of Educa
tion.
The Department of General Studies 
offers instruction in English, Mathe
matics, etc.
The Department of Secretarial 
Studies offers courses in Stenography,
Typewriting, Bookkeeping and Com
mercial Art, etc.
These courses are planned and will 
be presented to help teachers meet 
the demands and problems of the 
public school. From the scope of 
the work, it will be readily seen that 
such Courses may be found extremely 
useful for those who have the desire 
to improve their positions and to in
crease their teaching capacities.

Largest Number of Men Report in 
History of Clubs
The canvass made by the Musical 
Clubs for material has caused the largest 
number of new men to turn out for posi
tions in these Clubs that has ever been 
witnessed since its organizations No 
less than eighty men turning out Sunday 
to make the Club. We take this statement 
from Mr. McDowell, There is as good a 
class of material out this year as I have 
ever seen in large Universities. The sea
son opens up this year much earlier than 
ever before. The first out of town trip 
calls for November 15. The Musical 
C1ubs bulletin board announces the re
hearsal days.
As a result of the work and advance
ment shown by the Musical Clubs, for 
the past two years, the Student activity 
department has presented each member 
with a hat of a right nobby style. This 
hat has been designed for the most modern 
University wear, also lettered in front. 
These hats made their appearance on the 
campus some few days ago.

sume it must be your station. I heard 
this station again last evening and 
yesterday afternoon sending for quite 
a long time. The static was very 
bad or I would have been able to get 
almost every word of it, as there was 
little interference at the time.
If this is your station which I am 
hearing, I would be glad to know it, 
as the spark was fine and came in at 
times quite loud.
I would be glad to hear from you 
on this subject.
Yours very truly,
