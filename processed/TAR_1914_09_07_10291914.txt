THE DRAMATIC SCHOOL.
There is a general impression pre
vailing through the world of higher 
education that it is impossible to cre
ate a new school or department, and 
have it satisfactorily perform the du
ties allotted to it, or attain prominence 
in its line of endeavor, during the first 
few years of its existence. That such 
a condition must necessarily exist has 
been disproved by the success of our 
newly established dramatic school, and 
in fact all the schools composing this 
institution. For a department not yet 
a year old to be able to present to the 
public such plays as The Kings 
Threshold, The Betrayal, and The 
Shadow of the Glen, and without ex
ception gain favorable criticism from 
some of the foremost dramatic critics 
of the day, proves beyond the shadow 
of doubt that in the realm of higher 
education, the attainment of prestige, 
and a high standard of student work is 
a function of the faculty, and not of 
the age of the institution.
SEANNACHIE ENDORSES
BEANERY REGULATION.
The following letter was received 
from the Seannachie Society, endors
ing the restaurant regulation recently 
passed by the Seniors:
October 26, 1914. 
To the Editors of The Tartan:
Our attention has been attracted by 
the controversy which has so unexpect
edly arisen since the adoption of the 
Plebe regulation for the Beanery, by 
the Senior classes of the Science, De
sign, and Industries Schools. With the 
two-fold purpose of providing for the 
approaching winter and of eliminating 
before that time, the inconvenience at
tendant upon waiting in a long bread 
line, the Seniors formulated a rule re
quiring the first-year men to refrain 
from going to the commons until twen
ty minutes after the recitation periods 
have ended. The intentions of the 
upper classmen were well meant for 
all those concerned and in no way was 
there an intimation of humiliating the 
Plebes.
Unfortunately, the attitude of the 
Seniors must have been misrepresent
ed to the Plebes and to certain mem
bers of the faculty, or we believe, the 
present discussion would not have oc
curred. The solution to the difficulty, 
as the latter now stands, seems to 
hinge on the answers to the following 
two questions: Is there need for a
regulation? If so, is the present one 
reasonable?
The immediate necessity for some 
regulation was apparent to everyone 
who took part in, or viewed the daily 
procession extending from the board
walk in front of the Industries Building 
to the interior of the Beanery the first 
week or two of school. Since then the 
service has been improved but not suf
ficiently to materially decrease the size 
of the line. Objection has been further 
raised that the present ruling is un
democratic in principle. In answering 
this criticism we merely cite the un
written college law that upper class
men in the order of their seniority, 
deserve privileges not granted to 
Freshmen, even if such privileges must 
be enforced at the expense of slight 
discomfort to the new comers.
The assurance has been given by 
members of the faculty in charge of 
the beanery that the objectionable 
feature of the line will be eliminated 
by the installation of a hot plate, 
whereby it will be possible to serve 
twenty-five men per minute. The Sen
iors appreciate this action of the offi
cials and have promised to withdraw 
the regulation if its enforcement is 
proved after a reasonable length of 
time, to cause a financial deficit to the 
Beanery, or as soon as it is shown that 
admission to the Beanery at meal time 
may be promptly gained by all.
When advised of this promise and 
of the real attitude of the Seniors 
toward them, the Plebes of the Science 
and Design Schools amicably agreed 
to follow the rule, as originally pro
posed. So far as could be learned no 
decision had been reached in the In
dustries School.
After a careful consideration of the 
facts presented above, we decided by 
unanimous vote at our meeting last 
Friday to endorse the action of the 
Science and Design Senior classes and 
to urge the Industries Seniors to co
operate with their classmates of the 
other schools in maintaining the same 
position on this question of the Plebe 
regulation for the Beanery.
(Signed) Seannachie Society.
A new drinking fountain has been 
erected on the campus between the 
Science and Industries Building at the 
crossing of the two campus walks. The 
fountain is of the sanitary design and 
has a basin of white enamel.

BOARD OF CONTROL HOLDS FIRST 
MEETING.
Important Business Transacted.
The first regular meeting of the 
Board of Control was held on Wednes
day, October 21st. Several matters of 
great importance were taken up and 
passed upon. The Board of Control 
consists of three men from each school, 
representing the day, the night classes 
and the Alumni respectively. The fol
lowing men have been elected for the 
coming year:
Alumni ScienceGuy Halferty.
Alumni DesignD. W. Dait.
Alumni IndustriesW. M. Ball, Jr.
Day DesignF. L. Rownd.
Day IndustriesC. A. Parker.
Day ScienceA. S. Hines.
Night ScienceJ. M. Miller.
Night IndustriesC. M. Schute.
Night DesignAlfred Marks.
Supervisor of Athletics, J. H. McCulloch, is a member ex-officio and acts 
in an advisory capacity. The Board 
meets on the third Wednesday of each 
month.
The election of officers brought the 
following results;
PresidentD. W. Wait.
Vice PresidentF. L. Rownd.
SecretaryA. S. Hines.
Wait is the Alumni Design repre
sentative and was a star for several 
years on our track team. He was cap
tain of the 1911 team and former rec
ord holder at the two-mile event.
Rownd is the present manager of the 
football team and Hines has played 
for two years on each the baseball 
and basketball teams. All these men 
are entirely capable of the responsi
bility placed upon them, and they have 
always taken a decided interest in all 
things which were for the best interest 
to Carnegie Tech.
An executive committee was also 
elected consisting of one man from the 
day and the night classes, and an 
Alumni representative, together with 
the President and Secretary of the 
Board. Parker, Marks, and Halferty 
drew the position and Wait and Hines 
automatically became members.
The business transacted was of the 
most important nature. F. M. Pringle 
was elected baseball manager for the 
coming year, succeeding W. F. Routh. 
Pringle has been connected with the 
baseball team for two years and has 
also proved himself to be an energetic 
and hard work worker. Tyler was 
elected first assistant to succeed Prin
gle. Gayle A. Dull was re-elected track 
coach. His previous record speaks for 
itself. Coach Dull should have a good 
team this year. Manchester, a Design 
student, was elected as Publicity Rep
resentative.
Dutch Auerswald, Science, 1914, 
was granted a baseball letter and 
sweater for worthy service to the team 
for four years. He would have un
doubtedly earned his letter last year 
but suffered from a lame arm after 
making the team and was unable to 
play. He worked hard throughout for 
the interest of the team, and the 
Board found it a great pleasure to 
grant him a letter. This was another 
example of the fairness of the Tech

method in giving a letter to a man who 
has been faithful to a team. The Board 
should be congratulated for the step 
they have taken in this matter.
An election of track manager was 
deferred on account of the lack of a 
suitable man. The position is open to 
all and a notice will be placed on the 
bulletin boards in all the schools for 
candidates. The team needs an earn
est, energetic worker; a man with a 
personality and one who will work. 
We hope we are able to find him by 
the above mentioned means.

WHATS WHAT AND HOW
IN MEMORI AM
SVYLES UP VO VHE MINUVE
Ah, yes, the Old Beanery is one 
with Nineveh and with Tyre. It was 
not exactly full of good works when 
it passed, but it was congested with 
certain other things possessing a 
punch in both hands that good works 
never had.
It was never quite the same after 
they severed the umbilical cord that 
bound it to the late lamented hydraulic 
lab. Pardon for a moment while we 
choke down our emotion, we have had 
so many bereavements lately. (Game 
called on account of wet grounds.) 
But cease unavailing tears, or we must 
issue rain checks. Let the festivities 
proceed. At times the patient would 
revive and send out a flying squadron 
of ptomaine bacillary among its cower
ing victims, but they were rank ama
teurs, or has-beens and nothing worse 
than an intestinal riot resulted.
We who knew and feared the savage 
Old Beanery look askance at this new, 
denatured, prophylactic, colorifled suc
cessor with a Margaret Morrison Edu
cation. Perhaps we do the newcomer 
an injustice, it may have its own subtle 
scientific means of debilitation, but 
certainly not the smashing impact of 
those great engines of destruction, 
goolash, hamberger, et al. It may 
wreck the constitutions of its devoties 
by insidious approaches, but it does 
not look formidable. The exhilaration 
that one felt as he entered that palatial 
structure where the Old Beanery illus
trated the cheerful doctrine of total 
depravity; the tremulous conviction 
that one was going to have a gastron
omic adventure, all that has gone. Who 
could look with suspicion upon the 
pristine splendor of those new trays 
and weapons of offense provided for 
successful assault upon the eats? 
All is so safe and sane, but the pep 
has been used to embalm the hard
hitting bluff Old Beanery. One does 
not make his will before going to lunch 
now. Over the site of this great manu
factory of high gastronomic explosives, 
runs now the straight and narrow path 
leading to the Deans office, where ever 
and anon pilgrims go up to hold sweet 
converse with that potentate, and as 
they pass over the sacred spot emana
tions from below help to warm their 
chilly feet.
Tis said that the walk was laid there 
because nothing could be made to 
grow. Instead of the free-for-all push 
ball rush that brought the ravening 
Plebe within clutch of the lydite pie 
and the reinforced concrete roll, we 
now have the instructive spectacle of 
a graph drawn through a series of 
stomachs, empty as the zero symbol, 
and extending from the portals of the 
New (dietetic) Jerusalem out toward 
infinity. Only censored emanations 
from a cultured kitchen find now their 
modest way into shrinking interiors, 
where Gastric Juice, that hero of many 
a desperate battle in the trampled 
arena of the Old Beanery, grows arro
gant with easy victory.
The pious chaser of knowledge no 
longer sits in a one oclock lecture, 
most of his faculties intent with awed 
interest upon the football contest rag
ing in his abdominal stadium, mass 
plays allowed and no fouls called. Now 
he can peacefully slumber, if sufficient
ly screened by his fellows, or may 
speculate as he will about the prob
ability of the lecturer having a stroke 
of paralysis before the hour has ex
pired. Vale, farewell, Old Beanery, 
light weight champion of all producers 
of gastritis (the fancy, $200 kind or 
just plain belly ache). Shall we ever 
see your like again? Not if we have 
any luck, glory be!!

MUSICAL CLUBS SMOKER.
Last Friday night in the Green Room 
of the Schenley Hotel was held the 
most successful smoker in the history 
of the Musical Clubs. About ninety 
men were gathered together, of which 
nearly eighty per cent were new candi
dates.
During the early evening the -nw 
men and the old ones deypted their 
attentions to becoming acquainted. A 
large representation of last ye'ars club 
was present and it seemed like old 
times to hear them render Mynheer 
Vandunck with Swing Along for an 
encore and Song of the Vikings for 
good measure.
Having once gotten under way, the 
men felt it absolutely necessary to 
bring their excellent program to a 
close with an unexcelled rendition of 
Wanted a Wife, and Johnnie Schmoker, both of which, although a little 
rusty, were highly appreciated.
Tommy Maley and Sammy MacNulty 
kept the air filled with music of a 
popular and classical nature and com
pletely delighted the representative 
body before them.

Mr. Schtz rendered some favorite 
selections on the piano which were en
joyed by all. The applause which his 
rendition of the Spanish Waltz drew 
forth was sufficient proof of his ability 
as a musician.
The work of Mr. Hoffmann was of 
such quality as to set a new mark for 
oratorical achievements in the clubs. 
His selections were varied and enter
taining and were presented in a man
ner which won him much applause.
Among our honored guests for the 
evening were Mr. Field and Mr. Red
ding.
Mr. Field expressed his delight at 
seeing such a goodly representation of 
the schools present and commended 
the Musical Clubs for the praise which 
they won for the schools and for them
selves, as an active agency in adver
tising the good name of the Institute.
Mr. Redding was very much pleased 
with the predominating spirit of good 
fellowship which made itself so con
spicuous, and predicted an organiza
tion for the coming year which would 
eclipse last years Club as much as
that Club eclipsed the one of the pre
vious year.
The call to eats was proclaimed 
and no one felt a bit backward. The 
seats were arranged about a large Vshaped table with several additional 
round tables. Everyone was happy.
President Cameron spoke concerning 
the past, the present, and the future 
of the Clubs and outlined the gen
eral plan of procedure. He also im
pressed upon the men the necessity 
for keeping a goodly number of Cs 
at hand. Manager Todd gave a short 
talk about what was expected from 
the members of the club, in 
the way of deportment. He 
also asked for the co-operation of 
everyone, as that is necessary for the 
best interests of the Clubs. Further
more, he stated that he has several 
good trips planned and hopes that the 
high standard of excellence we have 
set for ourselves may be attained.
The Treasurer, Mr. McKee, ex
pressed himself as highly delighted 
with the turn-out this year and stated 
that he feels quite capable of handling 
the coin if everybody else will tend to 
his part.
At this time, Sg. Scalzo, who had 
been detained by another engagement, 
came in, and was immediately called 
upon, with a greeting of applause, to 
make a speech. The music which came 
from his mandolin made a tremendous 
hit and his' supreme ability was once 
more brought to the mind of the stu

THISTLE NEWS.
In the semi-finals of the fall tennis 
tournament Wilson and Vernon were 
pitted against each other but their 
match had not been played at the time 
of writing. Both of these men have 
played strong games and seem to have 
equal chances for the finals. In the 
other match, English, who has played 
a brilliant and consistent game from 
the beginning, worked his way into the 
finals by defeating Emmel, 6-2, 6-1. 
The match proved an interesting one 
and was closer than the score shows. 
From all indications the finals should 
be hotly contested.

The executive committee of th< 
Thistle Board held its regular weekly 
meeting on Monday, October 19, 1914. 
At this meeting Mr. T. L. Gleason, ol 
the Design School, submitted his resig 
nation as Business Manager and als . 
as a member of the Thistl 
Manager and also from the Thistl * 
Board. Owing to unforeseen circum
stances Mr. Gleason has found it e.: 
pedient to follow such a course. Hi 
resignation came quite unexpected:., 
to the Board which had just begun < ) 
become acquainted with him and to 
learn of his rare ability. His absen? 
will be noticed to no small extent.
The President of the Junior Desi;. I 
class was instructed to have a mr. 
chosen from that class to take M 
Gleasons place on the Board. T 
election resulted in favor of Mr. G. 
Long.
At a special meeting of the day mot
hers of the Thistle Board on Octo' .vv 
20, 1914, Mr. Carl Britsch, of the De

tion of Business Manager. Mr. Britsch 
has taken quite an interest in th;> 
Thistle and the Board feels certain 
that he will handle the position of 
Business Manager in a masterly w;.y.
The Board believes in foste.ing

WHAT THE GUILD IS DOING.
The first Guild Tea was held Mon
day afternoon, October 19th, in the 
Students Recreation Room. The busi
ness meeting which preceded the so
cial was called to order by the presi
dent, Dorothy Skinner, and reports 
were heard from the various commit
tees.
Mary Williams, chairman of the Wel
fare Committee, spoke about the work 
which her committee did during the 
first week of school in assisting the 
new girls to establish themselves in 
school and dormitory. Miss Williams 
suggested that next year the number 
of girls on the Welfare Committee be 
increased, and that each upper-classman should have assigned to her one 
Plebe to whom she should give per
sonal aid and consideration. Miss 
Williams thinks this plan would be 
most satisfactory. It would be an in
formal way of welcoming the Plebes, 
and would make the work more attrac
tive to the upper-classmen as well.
Marguerite Menges reported on the 
inspection work which was done by the 
Committee on Charities. Miss Menges 
visited a number of worthy institu
tions in Pittsburgh and vicinity, and 
gave a very interesting report of the 
conditions which she found.
It was decided by vote of thanks to 
make the work of the Guild for this 
year three-fold. It was voted that the 
precedent of giving one hundred dol
lars to some charitable organization 
in the city should be continued. In 
order to make this sum of money pos
sible a dance will be given in Decem
ber, shortly before the Christmas 
holidays. Mary Williams was appoint
ed chairman of the committee.
It was voted to put out an illustrated 
school calendar this year instead of a 
quotation calendar similar to the one 
of last year. The pictures will consist 
of school scenes. The work of getting 
up this calendar is under the direction 
of Lydia Bates of the Home Arts and 
Crafts Department.
The Guild has many requests each 
year from different institutions to aid 
them by giving articles of clothing. It 
was decided that the sewing this year 
should be for the Pittsburgh Home for 
Babies. All the girls in the school are 
asked to pledge themselves to help 
with this work if possible. Marguerite 
Menges is in charge of the sewing.
The third obligation which the girls 
assumed was to do personal work at 
the Childrens Temporary Home on 
Center avenue. This home is one of 
the organizations which is under the 
direction of the Pittsburgh Association 
for the Improvement of the Poor. The 
work will consist of visiting the home 
in the afternoons, especially Sundays, 
and furnishing some kind of entertain
ment for the children. Marion Pichel 
is in charge of this work.
The Guild is always glad to welcome 
members of the faculty at all the meet
ings, and will be grateful for any sug
gestions or assistance from them.
Mrs. Vermorken interested the mem
bers of the Guild last year in the Con
sumers League. The girls investigated 
this, and it was voted at the last meet
ing to appropriate five dollars for this 
purpose.
The Guild wishes to urge the co-oper
ation of the entire student body in the 
carrying out of the work this year. 
Every girl is needed, and all assistance 
will be appreciated.
MARGARET MORRISON GIVEN 
SPECIAL RATES.
Through the kindness of the Athletic 
Association of the Carnegie Institute 
of Technology, the Margaret Morrison 
girls have been given a special rate on 
the season book of tickets for 1914- 
1915. The tickets are good for admis
sion to all home games in football, 
basketball and baseball. The price has 
been reduced to one dollar and a half 
for all women students. It is hoped 
that the Margaret Morrison girls will 
avail themselves of the opportunity 
and secure one of these tickets at once.
The girls ought to realize that they 
are a part of the Carnegie Institute of 
Technology, and should show their 
school spirit by attending the games 
given on their own field, at any rate. 
Buy a season ticket, and watch your 
school team win!
Girls in the Home Arts and Crafts 
Department have taken charge of the 
decorative material, and have com
pleted four attractive illustrations for 
this number. One is the cover design. 
The cover is 9 x 12 inches, and the art 
editor has endeavored to make it an 
attractive one. The general heading 
will be a landscape, and the heading 
for the departmental material will be 
a most unique illustration typical of 
Thanksgiving. A clever heading for 
the jokes and comic section has been 
designed by Lorna Williams. Miss Wil
liams is a Senior in the Home Arts and 
Crafts Department, and is the Art Ed
itor of the Shilling.
The price of the Shilling will be 
twenty-five cents per copy or the three 
copies issued during the school year 
for sixty cents. Any subscriptions will 
be gratefully received by any member 
of the Editorial Staff.
SHILLING TO APPEAR
NOVEMBER TWENTY-THIRD.
The Thanksgiving number of the 
Shilling will be ready for distribution 
on Monday, November 23rd. The board 
has been at work for several weeks, 
and have secured a number of good 
articles. A prize of five dollars has 
been offered for the best story. The 
contestants must write under assumed 
names, and the length of the articles 
must not exceed thirteen hundred 
words or contain less than one thou
sand.
Mr. Gottfried, a member of the 1910

try.

Economics Department is making in
spection trips to the different food pro
ducing or manufacturing plants in 
Pittsburgh and vicinity. Observations 
are made concerning every detail of 
the processes of the factory made pro
duct, and the cleanliness and sanita
tion of the building, employees and 
equipment are criticized.
Two visits have been made so far 
this semester. The first was to 
Heinzs, the Home of the 57 Varieties, 
and the other to Groves Dairy, at 
Braeburn, Pa.

INDUSTRIES ALUMNI DANCE.
Friday evening the Industries Alum
ni Association held its first quarterly 
entertainment and dance. Moving pic
tures of the students at work in the 
various departments were shown after 
which all those present repaired to the 
new hall in the Central Building, 
where the rest of the evening was 
spent in dancing.
PLEBE MEETING.

EDISON DAY OBSERVED.
The Thirty-fifth Anniversary of the 
invention of the incandescent lamp by 
Edison was observed by the students 
of the Department of General Equip
ment and Installation, School of Ap
plied Industries, on Friday afternoon, 
October 23rd. Several of the students 
of the upper class prepared papers on 
the life and work of Edison and read 
them at the meeting. A number of 
slides loaned by the General Electric 
Company were shown. An interesting 
feature were reminiscences by Mr. T.
B. A. David, a personal friend and at 
one time a co-laborer with Mr. Edison. 
Remarks were also made by Dean Connelley and Professor Calderwood.
IRISH PLAYS GIVEN BY STUDENTS
Continued from Page 1 
decorated for the occasion. At the 
conclusion of the stage performances, 
dancing was indulged in by the guests, 
the atrium of the building serving as 
the ball room.
In reference to the performances, 
Charles M. Bregg, dramatic critic for 
the Gazette Times, wrote in part:
Incidentally, it may be remarked, 
the occasion offered a fine test of the 
developing acting talent of the class 
in the department of dramatic arts. 
John Millington Synges The Shadow 
of the Glen, Padraic Colums The 
Betrayal and William Butler Yeats 
imaginative and poetic The Kings 
Threshold, were the little plays se
lected by Prof. Thomas Wood Stevens, 
head of the dramatic section of the 
School of Design. These things all 
conspired to make the event a sig
nificant one, both socially and as an 
evidence of the progress made in the 
wholly unique department of school's 
activities. The Carnegie Institute of 
Technology has the distinction of 
founding the only comprehensive 
school of dramatic art in America, in
cluding all branches of theatrical train
ing, and it is the only institution of its 
kind with a theater and workshop 
where the art of the stage may find 
broad and helpful expression.
To the critic of the stage the most 
interesting item was the production 
and acting of the three little plays, so 
difficult of definite interpretation even 
at the hands of players to the man
ner born and trained in the inditement of the racial and poetic phases of 
the compositions. To say that the 
young actors acquitted themselves 
with great credit is but to tell the 
simple truth. In speech, grasp of 
character and atmospheric denotement 
there was abundant evidence of fine 
training and latent talent. Mr. Colum 
has been assisting Prof. Stevens in 
the presentation of the plays, and evi
dence of it is found in the smoothness 
and accuracy of the several scenes as 
well as the intelligent attitude of the 
young players.

To analyze in detail either the plays 
or the playing is impossible here. Mr. 
Colums little play, The Betrayal, 
had its first performance in America so 
far as can be remembered, while Yeats 
truly beautiful lyric drama The Kings 
Threshold, was also new in this coun
try. Charles H. Meredith, who played 
the tramp in Synges play, and Morgan 
Lepoy in The Betrayal, assumed the 
role of Seanchan in the Yeats play at 
short notice, the original player having 
been taken ill. Mr. Meredith is a young 
actor of decided gifts, and in all that 
he did displayed a fine sense of re
pression and a clearly defined method 
of expression. Miss Annabel Ramsey, 
Charles H. Duffy, Harold D. Munnis, 
Alice Guthrie, S. H. Allen and Mary 
Blair were other young players who 
displayed native gifts combined with 
very excellent training. Indeed the 
productions, both as to stage arrange
ments and acting, were flattering 
proofs of the usefulness of this de
partment.

After the most successful but some
what monotonous game last Saturday 
with Grove City, Carnegie finds herself 
placed near the top in points scored. 
But we must still look to our laurels 
for the hardest part of the season re
mains. Bethany, Westminster, Pitt, 
and Allegheny are names which would 
strike fear into any other than the 
redoubtable Coach Steffen.
Bethany, the next aggregation that 
will play on Tech Field, is rather an 
unknown proposition in Pittsburgh. 
When talked to over the phone, the 
Bethany manager handed out a line of 
talk calculated to throw Carnegie off 
the scent of a hard battle, but his pur
pose failed. In Captain Rogers bunch 
in the green jerseys Tech can expect 
to meet a foe much more formidable 
than was Grove City. A team that 
could hold the strong University of 
West Virginia to a 13-0 score was not 
made up of striplings. Consequently, 
Coach Steffen will prepare for a tough 
contest.
In the past, Carnegie has only met 
Bethany once, when in 1912 we defeat
ed the West Virginia team 14-6. Last 
year a game was scheduled, but be
cause of the death of Dean Hewlett, 
was cancelled by Tech. This year, 
Bethany is trying out football under a 
new system, and is in the same class 
as ourselves.
Our team came out of the Grove City 
game in good shape. The only injuries 
of importance are a dislocated finger 
for Oeffinger, a strained back for 
Kreider. Crawford also has a bruised 
shin. It is possible that these men will 
be rested during the Bethany game 
and others given a chance to show 
their ability.

DESIGN SCHOOL NOTES
ORIENTAL FESTIVAL.
At a meeting of the Design School 
last Friday, the plans for an Oriental 
Festival were perfected. The festival 
will be held in Design School corridor 
on Thursday evening, November 5th. 
A very small assessment will be made 
upon every student in the school to 
defray expenses. Mr. Hornbostel has 
given the affair his hearty support in 
the donation of the orchestra. It is 
required that everyone be in oriental 
costume. The idea of these dances 
and festivals is to devote a keener and 
better friendship among the different 
departments of Design School, hence 
it has been deemed advisable to have 
only Design School students and facul
ty present. Besides dancing, the com
mittee has taken steps to obtain enter
tainment aside from dancing. The 
committee relies upon your presence 
to make it one grand success.
to be commended upon their newly 
aroused spirit. Mr. Rownd, the man
ager, would like to see everyone out 
next Saturday to the Bethany game. 
The success of the team this year is 
due somewhat to the large attendance 
by students. So help it along and 
every Design student turn out.

New Pipe Organ Used for First Time.
On Friday afternoon, October 23rd, 
The Spohr Trio, composed of Mr. Vic
tor Saudek, flutist; Mr. Jos. Derdeyn, 
cellist, and Mr. Jos. Schuecker, harp
ist, gave a concert in the theater of 
the Design School, to which all the 
students were invited. Mr. Saudek and 
Mr. Derdeyn are instructors in the 
music department and their interest 
in the students prompted them to 
give this opportunity to hear so rare 
a combination of instruments in a pro
gramme of chamber music.
Besides the regular trio members, 
Mr. Saudek, Mr. Derdeyn and Mr. 
Schuecker each played short solos 
which were very well received. At the 
close of the programme, Mr. OBrien 
of the Music Department, joined with 
the trio in a Meditation on the third 
prelude of Bach, for flute, cello, harp 
and organ.
Mr. OBrien played the new organ in 
the Design School for the first time
since its completion and it proved to 
be a magnificent instrument.

SCIENCE SCHOOL NOTES
FIRST GENERAL LECTURE.
Charles M. Scovel, on Life Insurance, 
is First Cutside Speaker of 
Lecture Course.
Charles M. Scovel, associate agent of 
the Northwestern Mutual Life Insur
ance Co., was the speaker secured by 
Dean Leete as the first outside lecturer 
of the Wednesday morning general lectur course of the Science School. With 
the topic of Life Insurance as his gen
eral subject, Mr. Scovel spoke in Room 
209, Science, at half past ten on Wed
nesday, October 21st.
Dean Leete, in introducing the 
speaker, explained the purpose of the 
course to be, to combine instruction 
and entertainment in a form attrac
tive to the students; and he asked for 
the hearty support of all the men by 
regular attendance every Wednesday.
When Mr. Scovel, near the beginning 
of his talk, said, Gentlemen of Pitt, 
I greet you, the student body didnt 
know what to do, and finally laughed. 
After the speaker had realized his mis
take, he said, I expect and hope to 
live to see the day when Pitt and Tech 
will co-operate to make the best edu
cational center the world has known.
On his subject Life Insurance 
What It Is and What It Means, the 
lecturer said in part: Life insurance
is a business, it is not a philanthropy, 
it is not a government paternalism. 
Nothing in the line of business is half 
so beneficient as life insurance, and 
yet it is truly a business.
It is the glory of American life in
surance that it has been formed by a 
corporation, and the voluntary action 
of American manhood, and has all the 
efficiency of the corporation manage
ment. The speaker had been compaiing our system with the compul
sory goverment life insurance of Ger
many, which is said to be paupering 
that nation.
Im glad to speak of life insurance 
as a science in this Applied Science 
building. In 1693 Hailey, the discov
erer of the comet which bears his 
name, worked upon the question of 
guessing more accurately in the judg
ing of the probability of human life 
in large groups. He discovered that 
the natural death rate increases with 
the age.
There is nothing more uncertain 
than the length of individual human 
life, while on the other hand there is 
nothing more scientifically exact than 
the rate at which a large group will 
die off. The first fact created the need 
for life insurance; the second worked 
it out.
Passing from the scientific to the 
human side, it is not a proprietary 
profit-making institution. If I should 
write a half a dozen policies to the 
value of a million dollars and have ten 
million dollars in the bank to back it 
up with, it wouldnt be life insurance; 
it would be a personal gamble. It takes 
hundreds and thousands of policies to 
irake life insurance.
Life insurance is something the 
people make themselves, each person
insures the other against his death. It 
is a co-operation, it is very different 
from a proprietary business, where 
the interests of the two sides are ad
verse. Here there are no owners but 
the members in many of the old mu
tual companies. Just as soon as a 
man enters a company he is raw ma
terial, producer, and consumer.
Aside from its social value, life in
surance creates capital. Only money 
saved, and that portion of this which 
is invested is capital. That is very 
important at this time. The war in 
Europe is draining the worlds supply 
with a rapidity never known before. 
That need of capital is a vital thing in 
America for we dont have much. We 
are a nation of spendthrifts. Life in
surance is the very greatest of forces 
in America which are creating capital 
out of what otherwise wouldnt be 
capital.
The need of the country is that we 
speed up the life insurance agent as 
an act of patriotism. The need of 
the country is that we save.

GROVE CITY DEFEATED

system of coaching. The men played 
hard and fast, beside interfering well. 
This was the strongest feature of 
Techs play. Time and again the line
men and backs took out the secondary 
defense men and alloAved the man car
rying the ball to reel off long runs. 
Furthermore, the field was in fine 
shape for the kind of football our boys 
are accustomed to play.
The game brought to light several 
unknown quantities that have been on 
the bench. Marshall, McDowell, Kelly, 
Parke, Smith, Holzworth, and Levy all 
performed in a creditable manner 
when sent in for the regulars. Marshall 
showed the best. This lad, a former 
Peabody High star, is destined to be
come a sensation before the year is 
over. He carries the ball well, interfers and tackles hard and is a splendid 
broken field runner. His only fault is 
an inability to start quickly, he should 
be easily able to remedy this. His per
formance of running through the entire 
Grove City team on the kick-off and 
with only ten seconds left to play in 
the first half was a noteworthy one. 
He wriggled and dodged his way 
through a broken field for an 86-yard 
run, one of the prettiest pieces of work 
ever staged on Tech Field. Marshall 
reminds one very much of the old 
reliable, Billy Hittner. McDowell also 
played well. Although he was slight
ly flustered when he first entered the 
game, his running of the ball easily 
offset this fault. Mac tore off several 
long runs around the enemys flanks. 
He should steady down with experi
ence and prove a worthy successor to 
Kesner in time of need. Parke and 
Smith also were good for gains when 
called upon to carry the ball. Balsinger played a splendid game and was 
a tower of strength in the backfield. 
Lauer played an excellent defensive 
game and followed the ball well. He 
was also on the receiving end of sever
al forward passes. Welch, Hellstrom, 
Crawford and Mitchell played their 
usual good game. In mentioning the 
good players of the day, we can scarce
ly pass Captain McCaughey and 
Sunny Kesner. They both played a 
stellar game and showed to advantage 
at all times. McCaughey was a stoneContinued on Page 8
