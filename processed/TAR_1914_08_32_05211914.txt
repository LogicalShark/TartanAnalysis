(LOSE (ANEPITT WINS DUAL MEET IN FINAL EVENT
The match between Carnegie and 
Westinghouse, which was scheduled 
for last Saturday, May 16, was called 
off because there were no available 
courts. Such trouble in tennis will 
soon be a matter of history, now that 
the four new courts are being rapidly 
rolled and pounded into shape. All 
Carnegie tennis enthusiasts are mak
ing bold statements that these new 
courts will be the best in this sec
tion. Constant playing is the only 
thing which will make these prophe
cies come true.
There will be no more trouble 
about nets in the future. A rain-proof 
box in which the nets will be kept 
when not in use is to be placed near 
the courts. It is earnestly requested 
that the students co-operate by re
turning the nets to the box whenever 
they are through with them. Rain 
has never yet improved a tennis net.
Manager Wilson has prepared a 
very good schedule for this season. 
Nothing is known so far, of the 
strength of the teams to be played, 
but there will be no walk-overs. There 
was a fairly good showing of names 
on the cards recently posted calling 
for tournament entries. Because of 
the shortness of time left it was con
sidered impracticable to run off the 
tournament. From the list of fifty 
names, Captain Douthett was able to 
choose about a dozen for the varsity 
squad.
The tennis season opens tomorrow 
afternoon with a match with Penn 
State which will most probably be 
played on the new courts in front of 
the Design School. The players to 
represent Tech will be selected fin
ally by Mr. Harry Seymour, the well 
known tennis expert of this city, 
whose services the management has 
been very fortunate to secure. The 
candidates from whom Mr. Seymour 
will choose the team include four of 
last years letter men, Captain Douth
ett, Beeken, Savage, and Miller, be
sides such other good men as R. S. 
Wilson, Schuchman, Henning, Steen, 
Baum, Clinton, Bihlman, English, 
Knight, and Vesper.
The schedule for this season as ar
ranged by Manager Wilson is:
May 22Penn StateAt Home.
May 23Grove CityAway.
May 25GenevaAt Home.
May 28Grove CityAt Home.
June 6GenevaAway.
With Carnegie holding a lead of 
3 4-5 points, Pitt made a clean sweep 
in the broad jump and won the dual 
track meet last Friday afternoon by 
the score of 65 3-5 to 60 2-5. The 
Tech team showed the effects of care
ful training and every man did his 
share when the crucial test came. The 
outcome of two events, the 220-yard 
dash and the high jump, were the 
turning points in the meet which was 
decided in Pitts favor. Hemmann, 
our star sprinter, was just within ten 
feet of the tape when a pebble de
flected his path slightly and gave Ro
senthal the opportunity to finish on 
even terms with the Plaid runner. The 
tie gave Pitt the advantage of one 
point in the race we should have won. 
In the high jump fate seemed to be 
against us. King who was declared 
eligible at the last minute and who 
was expected to outdo his competi
tors, had to be content with the same 
jump as Wright and Criswell of Tech 
and Sheelan and Ashe of Pitt. This 
result necessitated a division of the 
points which gave us 1 3-5 points less 
than were counted upon. King can 
in no way be blamed for his perform
ance. He had been studying all week 
to make his scholastic deficiency and 
was, therefore, notin the best condi
tion. Had the 220-yard dash and high 
jump gone as we had hoped, the score 
would have been tied at 63. How
ever, the reverse was the case, and 
Pitt won a well earned victory. The 
Blue and Gold athletes were on the 
defensive during the entire struggle, 
if such an expression can be applied 
to a track meet, and are to be com
mended for their game finish.
The closeness of the contest is in
dicated by the fact that each school 
won six first places, while the remain
ing two were tied. Tech excelled in 
the races, and Pitt displayed its su
periority in the field events. The fea
tures of the afternoon were the break
ing of three Carnegie records and the 
equalling of another. The first mark 
fell in the one-mile race which Mc
Millan won in 4:42, bettering Waites 
time, made three years ago by 2 3-5 
seconds. Haselton won the two-mile 
race easily and then set a new record 
in the half-mile run of 2:01 2-5, clip
ping 2 3-5 seconds from his former 
mark registered two weeks previous, 
against Allegheny. Captain Clair 
broke the discus record for the sec
ond time this season, with a throw 
of 114 feet, 1-4 inch, which outdis
tanced his first mark by nearly 5 feet.
Hemmann ran the best 100-yard dash 
witnessed at Tech since 1911, equal
ling the record of 10 1-5 seconds held 
conjointly by Dowling and C. M. 
Crawford.
One of the prettiest races of the 
meet was the 140-yard dash. Two 
Pitt sprinters took the lead and held 
it going around the bend, apparently 
leaving Dunseith boxed in. Then 
with an exhibition of heady running, 
conspicuous by its absence, the Pitt 
men moved to the outside of the 
track and gave Dunseith the pole as 
well as his opportunity to finish first 
in the best performance of his rising 
career. The fight for second place 
was also exciting, Shoff of Pitt beat
ing out his Captain, M. Marshall, by 
the mere width of his body. Scott of 
Pitt scored the most points, winning 
both hurdle races in fast time and 
taking third place in the broad jump. 
McMasters and Ammons were other 
important factors in the Blue and 
Golds victory, each gaining 8 points. 
Haselton was the Tech star, with 10 
points, followed by Hemmann with 9, 
Captain Clair and McMillan with 8 
each. Both King and Wright ob
tained a second and tie for first. King 
pushed Scott all the way in the high 
hurdles but could not overtake him. 
Meredith showed improved form 
when he himself finished third in the 
low hurdles. Campbell ran a good 
second in the mile race and Rieser 
furnished a surprise by placing in the 
two-mile run. Kirk was third in the 
pole, vault and hundred-yard dash 
thus getting enough points for his let
ter. Adams did likewise by placing 
in the discus throw and shot put. In 
the latter event he made his best dis
tance of the season with a heave of 
34 feet, 9 1-2 inches.

Tech played Allegheny at Meadeville last Saturday, May 16, and came 
back victorious with a 7-5 score. The 
game was all in favor of the home 
team until the seventh inning, when 
McDonald started things by getting 
three bases on the poor pegging of 
the bag-men. Ryan was thrown out 
at first by Emery and MacDonald 
scored. Kreider flied out to left field, 
but Oeffinger followed with a double 
and scored on Brines single, tying the 
score. In the eighth DeMuth started 
hostilities with a two-bagger. Humph
ries and Thomas were easy out. Then 
MacDonald was safe on Shenefelts 
error and stole second. Ryan singled, 
scoring DeMuth and MacDonald, and 
later stole second. Kreider singled 
and Ryan crossed the plate. This 
ended Techs scoring but it was suffi
cient to win the game.
Allegheny scored once in the sec
ond. In the fourth they began to find 
Frye. Campman singled and stole 
second. Emery walked and Campman 
was caught at the plate by a good peg 
by DeMuth who received Gilberts 
single. Bash doubled, sending in Em
ery and Gilbert. Shenefelt flied to 
Kreider. Pitcher Gilbert was safe and 
Bash scored on Brines over-throw at 
first. Ryan took the box in the fifth 
and held Allegheny to one more run 
which came in the eighth when C. Gil
bert singled and scored on Bashs 
double.
Bashs single, two doubles, and 
triple, were the big feature of the 
game. McDonald brought in three 
runs, and stole four of Techs ten pur
loined sacks.

RUSHM.a.
For the past few weeks we have 
been printing articles from other col
lege papers on interfraternity agree
ments as to rushing. Case Tech has 
adopted the rule that no man may 
be initiated into a fraternity until the 
second semester. At the University 
of Pennsylvania they are considering 
the prohibition of any rushing before 
the second term. The stringent rush
ing rules recently adopted at the Uni
versity of Texas were printed in last 
weeks Tartan.
We should like to see some action 
of similar nature taken by the various 
fraternities at Carnegie. We know that 
at least two fraternities here will not 
initiate a pledged man until he has 
successfully completed the work of 
the first semester; and we believe that 
it would be a good thing if all the 
fraternities would require the same 
scholastic standing of their new men.
The mutual advantages of such a 
rule are evident. It is impossible al
ways to judge correctly a mans abil
ity from his preparatory school rec
ord. The new conditions which he 
meets at a technical school may be so 
different that it is only with consider
able difficulty that he is able to meet 
them. It is a serious thing for a fra
ternity when several of its newly ini
tiated men drop out of school; the 
standing of the fraternity in the eyes 
of the school authorities is quite like
ly to suffer. Then, too, a pledged 
man, if he knows that he must pass
his first semester before he can be 
initiated, is usually going to make a 
strenuous effort to keep up in his 
work.
We think that it might even be 
wise to postpone rushing until after 
the end of the first semester. This 
would, of course, include the forego
ing; because onl> men who had suc
cessfully passed the first term would 
be rushed. Then the Plebe in his first 
semester would be able to devote his 
entire attention to school work; he 
would not lose sight of the fact that 
he came to school primarily to get an 
education and not to join a fraternity; 
and he would not get a distorted idea 
of his own importance as sometimes 
happens when several fraternities join 
in a mad, undignified scramble after 
a certain man. Furthermore, he 
would get a view of college life as 
one of a multitude of his fellows, and 
not as an unimportant member of a 
limited, sometimes snobbish organi
zation; if he afterward joined a fra
ternity, he would be much more like
ly to realize that in all things his 
Alma Mater ought to be placed first, 
his fraternity second.
The results would be: for the man, 
better scholarship; for the fraternity, 
a closer co-operation with the school 
authorities and more satisfactory 
material; for the institution, groups 
of students who would place the so
cial, political and mental life of the 
whole student body ahead of the sel
fish interests of any one organization.
V. JVM.M.a A FRATlR.MTY.
(Reprinted from The Wisconsin 
Daily Cardinal.)
Shall I join a fraternity and If 
so, which one shall I join are two 
question that will confront many 
freshmen at the end of this week. 
They are questions, whose settlement 
deserves careful and deliberate con
sideration, for they involve four vital 
years of a mans life.
The former is largely a question of 
personal tastes and circumstances. If 
your tastes are social, if your financial 
means are relatively large, if you are 
willing to sacrifice a certain amount 
of personal freedom, the fraternity 
will probably appeal to you. If you 
carefully weigh the advantages and 
disadvantages !of membership in a 
fraternity and then decide to join, no 
one will quarrel with you over your 
decision. However, do not make such 
a decision simply because yor are flat
tered by the receipt of a bid. There 
is nothing sacred or precious about 
fraternity men that should cause you 
to fall all over yourself in order to 
become one of them. When you con
sider that oft-times the basis for se
lection is wealth or even booze ca
pacity, you will recognize that fra
ternity membership is not always a 
thing to be wished and hoped for. 
Nor should you join a fraternity, un
less you are certain that membership 
therein will not cause you to lose the 
common touch, unless you are sure 
that you will thereafter be able to 
act and feel toward non-fraternity men 
just the same as toward fraternity 
men. The advantages of fraternity
membership are not comparable to 
the disadvantage of becoming a snob.
If you determine to join, you will 
probably confront the problem of a 
choice between fraternities. The test 
of a fraternity is not the amount of 
money that the members can flourish, 
the pretentiousness of the lodge 
which they possess, nor the manner of 
clothes that they wear. These are 
mere superficialitiesthe things that 
attract, but not the things of worth.
The joining of a fraternity is much 
like undertaking matrimony. The ex
perience does not end with the pay
ment of the initiation fee. When a 
student joins a fraternity, he is choos
ing companions for the remainder of 
his college course. As these men are, 
so he is likely to become. They may 
be wealthy, genial social butterflies, 
but they may not be men. They may 
be royal entertainers, but they may 
be cribb|ers and wallowerjs in ,the 
very bottoms of scholarship. They 
may be talented and accomplished, 
but they may be immoral. A frater
nity may be of high national stand
ing, but its members here may be 
undesirable associates. These are 
surface deceptions to be guarded 
against.
The fraternity you join may make 
of you a good scholar, a hard worker 
and a clean, well-balanced man. It 
may also make of you a snob, a so
cial fritterer, a squanderer of time, 
money, energy and health. It is not 
the fraternity you join; it is the group 
of men. They may make you or ruin 
you. Do not be deceived by the rush
ing season glamour; it is but a ve
neer. The substance lies deeper. 
Look for MEN in the fraternity, be
fore you join.

The Department of Drama has 
made extensive preparations for the 
production of another interesting 
play. It will consist of three short 
plays to be given at one performance. 
Shadows of the Glen, by L. M. Synge, 
is to be one. The others have not 
been decided upon. The play will be 
given before the close of the term, 
the date to be announced later. The 
last production of the Department of 
Drama was a tremendous success and 
we look forward to see the new play 
bring the same results. The scenery, 
as before, is being painted by the stu

Hard Week Ahead For Ball Team.
The Varsity base ball team will face 
its most important rivals of the sea
son the coming week during which 
four games are carded. Penn State 
will be the first opponent and will ap
pear this afternoon. This is the ini
tial meeting of the two teams on Tech 
field. The games that have been 
played in two previous years, were 
staged at State College. They were 
hard fought struggles resulting in low 
score victories for State both times. 
In view of the improvement shown 
lately by the Plaid nine, another close 
contest is expected. Ryan who has 
developed into our most dependable 
hurler, will likely be in the box 
against Liebert or Hesselbacker for 
State.
Tomorrow and Saturday Tech will 
meet West Virginia Wesleyan away 
from home. Next Tuesday the return 
engagement with Pitt will be played. 
The result of the first game gives no 
indication of what may occur in the 
second one, for the Carnegie nine was 
in poor shape at the beginning of the 
season. Hines has been prevented 
from playing by a sore shoulder, but 
its hoped he may soon round into 
condition and be able to take his reg
ular turn pitching. With Auerswald 
out of the game, it was necessary to 
shift Brine to short stop, and to use 
a new man, Thomas, at third base. 
The latter performed very creditably 
in his two try-outs and will likely 
become a regular.
The teams record so far is three 
victories and the same number of de
feats, but hencefortth it should win a 
much larger percentage of its games. 
Those played on Tech field this af
ternoon and Tuesday will be called 
at 3:30 oclock.

A permanent constitution to gov
ern the Assembly of the School of Ap
plied Industries was adopted at the 
meeting of that body on Wednesday, 
May 13th. The idea of the Assembly 
is to centralize all the activities of the 
various classes and departments for 
the common good.
The preamble, accordingly, reads as 
follows: It shall be the object of
the Assembly to unite all the students 
of the day school of Applied Indus
tries into an organization in which the 
authority of the student body shall be 
vested and by which said authority 
shall be exercised along the follow
ing lines: (1) By developing and
maintaining a firm spirit of loyalty 
among the students of this School.
(2) By assisting the Dean and the 
Faculty in all matters pertaining to 
the welfare of the School and the In
stitute as a whole, and (3) By co
operating with the other Schools of 
Carnegie Institute of Technology in 
promoting and carrying on student 
activities and all matters of general 
interest.
In order to best carry out the pur
pose of the Assembly, the Constitu
tion provides for the following de
pendent departments:
1. Department of Athletics.
2. Department of Club Room Man
agement.
3. Department of Student Deport
ment.
4. Department of Student Organ
izations.
The Department of Athletics is em
powered to promote an interest in 
athletics both in the School of Ap
plied Industries and the Carnegie In
stitute of Technology as a whole. It 
is aimed to have the department co
operate with the Faculty Committee 
on Athletics. The Department of 
Club Room Management has charge 
of the student club room as to its 
furnishings and equipment, can make 
assessments when necessary, etc. The 
Department of Student Deportment 
takes over the functions formerly per
formed by the Senate of the School of 
Applied Industries, and stands ready 
to co-operate with the Faculty Com
mittee on Discipline when requested 
to do so. The Department of Stu
dent Organizations is an unusual pro
vision in such constitution. It will 
aim to encourage the organizations 
of clubs, societies, associations, and 
to see that they are maintained from 
year to year; also, to aid in the matter 
of class organization and to urge that 
the classes hold their meetings from 
time to time. The necessity of this 
Department, however, is self evident.
The officers, to be elected, at the 
first meeting in June, consist of a 
President, Vice President, Secretary 
and Treasurer. According to the Con
stitution as adopted, Chairman Price 
is authorized to appoint a nominating 
committee, which is to report at the 
regular meeting on May 27th.

meeting was a talk by Mr. McCul

An engineer found himself sum
moned one day into the presence of 
his commander. Napoleon stood on 
the bank of a wide river gazing across 
to where he desired to attack with ar
tillery.
How wide is that river? was the 
question put to the engineer.
Let me get my instruments, was 
the reply, as he turned to go for them.
I must know at once, the emperor 
insisted.
The engineer went down to the level 
bank of the river, and, standing erect, 
gradually bent his head forward till 
the edge of his hat brim just touched 
the line from his eyes to the water 
line at the opposite bank of the river. 
Then, keeping his head bent as it was, 
he wheeled a quarter turn till his eyes 
looked along the hat brim and met the 
land at a point on the same side of the 
river on which he stood. Here he 
noted a rock or tree near the point at 
which his eyes met the ground, and, 
calling a soldier, directed that a stake 
be driven near that point, as he should 
direct. Then, by motioning just where 
to drive the stake, he fixed the point at 
which the line from hat brim and eye 
reached the bank. Turning to the em
peror, Your majesty, said he, the 
distance from where I stand to the 
stake is the width of the river.

The Carnegie Choral Club will ap
pear in its maiden performance in 
Frederick Cowens Cantata, The Rose 
Maiden, on Wednesday evening, May 
27, in the theatre of the Design 
School.
Admission to this performance will 
be by ticket. Each member of the 
Club will be given as many tickets 
as he or she can use. Tickets are to 
be given only to the people who are 
absolutely sure of attending the Can
tata. After a given time the seats, 
whose owners have not appeared, will 
be considered vacant and any one can 
use them. This system seemed the 
only logical way of taking care of 
those whom the members wished to 
be present and the others who desired 
to hear the Cantata.
The Cantata itself is very beautiful. 
The music and the theme go hand in 
hand, and, as a result, one can get 
a very good idea of the Cantata from 
the music alone for it pictures the 
seasons, the changing moods of the 
characters, and is full of wonderful 
harmonies.
The story of The Rose Maiden is 
charming. The Queen of the Flower 
Fairies, weary of a life of unbroken 
calm, prays of the newly-returned 
spring that he will bestow upon her 
also the gift of love that he bestows 
upon man. He warns her of the risk 
she runs, but finally yields to her en
treaties by changing her, while she 
sleeps, into the form of a beautiful 
girl. Under the name of Roseblossom she wanders through the world 
to find the love that she seeks, and 
meets with a girl, who having been 
betrayed and deserted by her lover, 
loses her senses and dies broken
hearted. But, undeterred from her 
search, Roseblossom becomes the 
wife of a forester, with whom she 
lives for a time in such perfect happi
ness that she cannot survive his death. 
The elves bewail the death of their 
Queen, and curse love as fatal to 
peace and happiness.
Mr. McDowell has been training 
the Club all year and the entire Club 
is looking forward to a very success
ful performance.

.ine Colleges To Compete For Sec

Saturday afternoon, the track 
championship of this district will be 
decided by the intercollegiate meet 
held under the auspices of the Uni
versity of Pittsburgh at Schenley oval. 
Nine colleges, including Tech, Pitt, 
State, W. and J., Allegheny, West 
Virginia Wesleyan, Westminster, Ge
neva, and Grove City will compete for 
the title. By virtue of its victory last 
year and early season from this 
spring, Penn State rules the favorite. 
Its margin, if any, will likely be very 
small, for both Tech and Pitt should 
give the Blue and White team a hard 
tussle. From the results of the dual 
meet, Techs chances for second place 
seem' brighter than Pitts even though 
the latter school won. Her athletes 
will surely be defeated in several of 
the events in which they were victori
ous over Tech. The same holds true 
in our case, but not to so great an ex
tent we believe. W. and J. or Alle
gheny is the pick for fourth place. 
The Red and Black team consists of 
a good sprinter, quarter miler, broad 
jumper, and two weight men; while 
Allegheny can boast of a hurdler, 
weight man, and pol<* vaulter. West
minster has a consistent performer in 
the weight events. The strength of 
the West Virginia school is unknown, 
but Geneva and Grove City do not ap
pear formidable.
An interscholastic meet will also be 
held in conjunction with the collegiate 
contests. Because of the large num

will start at 1 oclock. No admission 
fee will be charged.

lditors .ote: The following is ab
stracted from a letter received by
Professor Trinks from Edgar D.
Lambert, 13. Mech.
Last June, when I returned to the 
Porter-Cable Machine Company, my 
work, for some time, was in the ca
pacity of machinist, to get out jobs 
which had been giving more or less 
trouble. The first problem was a 
bunch of pencil sharpeners which had 
been partly finished, then abandoned 
because of inaccuracies which made 
assembling difficult. I devised gages 
and tools that enabled me to save the 
work.
Then we had an order for 100,000 
binders such as go in the back of a 
loose-leaf note bookmostly punch 
press work. They had been trying to 
do the work on one press and the 
work was slow and imperfect. By my 
suggestion, they rented four other 
presses and arranged them so that the 
work passed right from one to the 
next and any defect in forming was 
discovered immediately. With a gang 
of six or seven men, this got out the 
remainder of the order in very satis
factory shape.
The screw machine department had 
been poorly organized so that all the 
machines were often idle and when 
work came in, it frequently cost us 
more than the contract price. I 
worked a while setting up and running 
the Brown and Sharpe automatics to 
become familiar with them. Then I 
learned to lay out the cams. This 
was easy after my course in Machine 
Design. Now I make the estimates on 
which the price is based, lay out the 
cams and see that the operator gets 
out the work or know the reason why. 
For the past three months we have 
had three machines always working 
and sometimes six. I remember only 
one job in this time on which we did 
not make a profit and I learned from 
that one so that we did make a profit 
on a second lot at the same price.

FlDlRATlD l.aM.llR
M.a SVCMlTMlS.
Last week on Wednesday evening, 
May 13, at 7:30 P. M., V. Karapetoff, 
the famous exponent of experimental 
electrical engineering, addressed the 
Federated Engineering Societies in 
room 11, Machinery Hall. Although 
originally slated for a talk on Per
sonality, he spoke on a more techni
cal subject, The Electrification of 
Trunk Lines.
If a person would ask me whether 
I thought a trunk line ought to be 
electrified, I would say I didnt want 
to answer without knowing the cir
cumstances. This grates on a per
son, every time a practical man 
dodges a direct question, wanting to 
know the circumstances. While elec
trification is going on all the time, it 
is not going on as fast as some en
thusiasts would like.
But I think this is a good thing. 
One mistake made in electrification 
would do lots of harm. So, being in 
business for life, we dont want to 
advise something that will discredit 
our profession.
One of the first questions to come 
up in electrification is, Can you get 
more horsepower out of a lb. of coal 
burned in a big power plant than in 
separate locomotives. In some cases 
I would say you can. The net saving 
in coal is about fifty per cent, provid
ed the net traffic is sufficient to keep 
the power house at near its capacity. 
In the case of the New York Central, 
I would say the traffic is dense 
enough to warrant that.
Now, what about this public nui
sance, the smoke problem? Is it a 
question for the railroads or a civic 
one? I claim it is a civic one, and 
can not be measured in dollars and 
cents. If the railroads can show you 
that they cant borrow money to pay 
for electrification, should we not con
sider that since the question of smoke 
abatement does not concern the rail
roads, but does concern the citizens, 
that they should help to pay for elec
trification.
I think the conditions in Pitts
burgh are disgraceful. I know of not 
even a beginning being made for elec
trification here.
Now a third point in favor of elec
trification is better suburban service. 
For instance in the morning you may 
have a train of ten cars, six motors 
and four trailers; then seven cars later 
in day or always in proportion to the 
demand. Such flexibility is made 
possible by means of a famous in
vention called multiple-unit control. 
The motorman from any place in the 
train may operate all the motors sim
ultaneously. And then compared to 
the starting torque of a motor, that 
of a steam engine is small. A much 
faster suburban service with quick 
accelerations and radiations results. 
And then there is the pleasure of rid
ing. Wouldnt anybody rather ride 
in a clean, swift electric car at morn
ing and night, than be forced to 
breathe smoke and cinders?
Also about electric terminals, the 
rise in the value of real estate is very 
great. This more than paid the cost 
of electrification about the New York 
Centrals terminal. They designed 
the station on two levels, with the 
long distance trains above. There is 
no reason why an electric terminal 
should not be designed for three or 
four levels.
Electrification in mountains was ex
plained by Professor Karapetoff as 
enabling much steeper grades to be 
handled at speeds exceeding that of 
a steam locomotive by far. Also the 
long tunnels are often electrified on 
account of the suffocating smoke of 
the steam train. A discussion of ex
isting electrified roads, and of the dif
ficulties attendant on electrification 
was carried on between the speaker, 
and several students.
At nine Karapetoff had to leave to 
keep another engagement, and then 
the different societies which filled the 
hall adjourned for separate meetings.

there is printed in full below the new

The term Resident of Pittsburgh, 
as here used, is defined to mean a stu
dent living in Pittsburgh under or 
over twenty-one years of age whose 
parent, or guardian (in case neither 
parent is living), is a resident of Pitts
burgh. A day student over twentyone years of age, whose parent or 
guardian is not a resident of Pitts
burgh, cannot himself become a resi
dent of Pittsburgh by reason of the 
Election Laws of Pennsylvania (Art. 
VIII, fl4) which reads: For the pur
pose of voting, no person shall be 
deemed to have gained a residence by 
reason of his presence, or lost it by 
reason of his absence, while employed 
in the service, either civil or military, 
of this State or of the United States, 
nor while engaged in the navigation 
of the waters of this State or of the

of learning, nor while kept in any

expense, nor while confined in public 
prisons. A night student over twenty-one years of age can become a resi
dent of Pittsburgh as his course of 
study is incidental, the work in which 
he is engaged during the day being 
his principal occupation. He can, 
therefore, be assessed, not under the 
student classification, but under the 
group in which the nature of his em
ployment falls, and can thus register 
as a qualified voter in Pittsburgh.

Ryan oitches Another aood aame.
The Carnegie nine showed improved 
form last Thursday against Musk
ingum and had little trouble in win
ning by the one-sided score of 10-0. 
Ryan was in the box again for the 
Plaid team and performed in a high 
class manner, letting his opponents 
down with but four hits.
A change in our line-up was neces
sary because Auerswald was bothered 
with a sore arm. Brine took his place 
at short stop and Thomas was tried 
out at third base. In his first attempt, 
he gave a good account of himself. 
Brine and Oeffinger starred for Tech. 
Both played excellently in the field, 
while the latter led in the stick work 
with four hits. Ryan also did good 
work at bat, making two safe drives, 
one of which was a three-bagger, and 
knocking in three runs.
Until the last two innings, the game 
was interesting. Mcllvaine, of the 
visitors, allowed only five hits during 
that time, but he was not accorded the 
best support, and four runs were put 
across the plate by Tech. In the sev
enth and eighth innings, however, the 
wrecking crew put in its appearance. 
Singles by McDonald, Ryan, and Oef
finger, a sacrifice fly by Kreider and 
a two-base hit by Lain netted three 
runs in the seventh chapter. Three 
more were scored in Carnegies final 
turn at bat on an error by the Musk
ingum second baseman, singles by Mc
Donald and Oeffinger, and Ryans 
three-bagger.
Muskingum looked dangerous in 
only one inning, the second when two 
men were on bases with none out. But 
Ryan tightened then and retired the 
side runless. Sinclair played the best 
game for the visitors, making half of 
their total number of hits. The score 
by innings:
First inning: Muskingum: Lemon 
started batting. Ryan took care of his 
bunt. Allison was thrown out by Oef
finger. Atkinson flied out to Kreider. 
No runs, no hits.
Carnegie: Kreider was thrown out 
by Mcllvane. Oeffinger grounded out 
from Allison to Garges. Brine struck 
out. No runs, no hits.
GALLEY ELEVVEN ..........................
Second inning: Sinclair singled, pro
ceeded to second when Arnold walked, 
and was caught by Ryan in his at
tempt to steal third. Johnson ad
vanced Arnold by a sacrifice. Mor
row went out at first. No runs, one 
hit.
Carnegie: Lain was out at first and 
DeMuth struck out. Then Humphries 
started things with a two-bagger, and 
scored the first run when Thomas 
reached first on Garges error. Mc
Donald struck out. One run, one hit.
Third inning: Garges was thrown 
out at first by Ryan. Oeffinger took 
care of Mcllvanes grounder. Lemon 
went out, Ryan to Humphries. No 
runs, no hits.
Ryan struck out. Kreider walked. 
Oeffinger singled. Brine advanced 
both runners with a sacrifice, Kreider 
scoring. Oeffinger tried to score on
Lains hit to short stop and was 
thrown out at the plate. One run, one 
hit.
Fourth inning: Brine took care of
Allisons fly, and then threw Atkinson 
out at first. Sinclair singled and Arn
old struck out. No runs, one hit.
DeMuth grounded out, Mcllvane to 
Garges. Humphries struck out. 
Thomas flew out to Kreider. No runs, 
no hits.
Fifth inning: Johnson went out,
Ryan to Humphries. Morrow fled out 
to Brine. Kreider gathered Garges 
fly. No runs, no hits.
McDonald reached first safely on 
Mcllvanes error but was thrown out 
by Garges at second. Ryan tried to 
stretch a two-bagger into a three-bag
ger and was thrown out at third. 
Kreider singled, and scored on Oeffingers single. Oeffinger scored when 
Brine was safe at first on Morrows 
error. Lain struck out. Two runs, 
two hits.
Sixth inning: Mcllvane went out, 
Oeffinger to Humphries. Lemon 
struck out. Allison also went out by 
the Oeffinger-Humphries route. No 
runs, no hits.
Arnold threw DeMuth out at first. 
Humphries singled and was caught 
stealing second by Sinclair. Thomas 
flied to Lemon. No runs, one hit.
Seventh: Atkinson flied out to Krei
der. Brine threw both Sinclair and 
Arnold out at first. No runs, no hits.
Morgan took Garges place at first. 
McDonald singled, stole second and 
scored on Ryans single. Ryan prompt
ly stole second, advanced to third on 
Kreiders sacrifice to middle, and 
scored on Oeffingers single. Oeffing
er stole second. Brine flied out to 
Arnold. Lains two-bagger scored 
Oeffinger. DeMuth ended the inning 
with a fly to Lemon. Three runs, four 
hits.
Eighth inning: Johnson flied out to 
Thomas. Morgan knocked a two-bag
ger and was run down between second 
and third. Cain, batting for Morrow, 
singled. Mcllvane flied to Lain. No 
runs, two hits.
Sinclair caught Humphries fly. 
Thomas was safe at first on Lemons 
error. McDonald singled. Ryan 
scored Thomas and McDonald with a 
three-bagger. Kreider went out at 
first. Oeffinger singled, scoring Ryan. 
Brine made the third out by flying to 
Cain. Three runs, three hits.
Ninth inning: Lemon struck out. 
Allison flied out to DeMuth. Thomas 
ended the game by throwing Atkinson 
out at second.

SCMl.Cl oLlBlS DlFlAT 
FACULTY.
The memory of last years bitter 
struggle was revived last Saturday, 
when the Science Plebes and Faculty 
engaged in a very exciting game of 
baseball. The Plebes got away to an 
early lead and were never headed by 
the ever-fighting Faculty baseball 
stars, the final score being 15-3 in fa
vor of the Plebes.
Darlington, the Plebes star hurler, 
pitched an excellent game, holding the 
opposing team at his mercy at all 
times. The support accorded him was 
of the major league variety. Espe
cially did Doherty, at short stop, turn 
in some great plays, and time and 
time again drew forth vociferous ap
plause from the small army of faith
ful Plebe rooters, by his dazzling 
catches and stops.
For the Faculty, Doctor Harris was 
by far the fielding star. Several of 
his catches were of the sensational 
order. In the third inning he dis
played great fleetness of foot by run
ning down and tagging out Detweiler, 
between first and second bases. Mr. 
Rundle, Mr. Sweet and Mr. Eyman 
played very nicely and are deserving 
of much credit.
The showing of the faculty might 
have been much better, had they had 
a little more practice. And then again 
the umpiring of D. Curtis, who is also 
the manager of the Plebe team, was 
rather faulty several times, and the 
Faculty always seemed to get the 
worst end of it.
The Plebes have a fine, evenly bal
anced team and should have a very 
creditable record this season. It is 
to be regretted that Darlington and 
Doherty did not try out for the var
sity, but great things may be expected 
from them in the lineup of the school 
team next year.

Last Saturday noon there was 
staged at Tech field a base ball game 
which gave to the Sophomore Electri
cal team the claim to the cham
pionship, since they had played and 
defeated all of the other Sophomore 
sections which had teams.
This time the Mechanicals were de
feated. At the start they played well, 
Tucker pitching a good game until 
the fifth inning; then the Electricals 
hit hard and put the score well in their 
favor. Ashworth and Korts both 
pitched two innings for the Mechani
cals after Tucker quit, but Gower, 
backed with the strong Electrical in
field, pitched the entire game. Guter 
starred for the Mechanicals both in 
the field and at b?t, while perhaps 
Brunot was as great a surprise as any 
for the Electricals, bringing in five 
runs and hitting hard and often, be
sides fielding his position faultlessly.
At a meeting of the Electrical sec
tion on Friday, May 8, the class form
ally elected Chuck Doherty Cap
tain and P. N. Bossart Manager of 
their team.
Preceding the noon game on Satur
day, the Plebe Section B team beat 
the Faculty, 15-3 in a five-inning con
test. The score would have been 
worse had it not been for Doc Har
ris work as Captain and first base
man for the Faculty. His famous div
ing tag between first and second 
rocked the stands with laughter. Also 
the work of Mr. Rundle as pitcher and 
of Professor Davisson, all around the 
diamond merits mention.

Monday a week ago, the Varsity 
baseball team journeyed to Washing
ton, Pa., to play off a game with W. 
& J., postponed from April 25, and 
was defeated by the Red and Black 
nine, 8-2. Carnegies weakness in 
hitting was again apparent and only 
four singles were garnered at Younkins expense. Techs defense, which 
can usually be relied upon, was a little 
uncertain, three of the four errors be
ing responsible for as many runs. Urquhart made his first appearance of 
the season in the box and was hit 
rather freely. But his control was 
good. He struck out six men and is
sued only one pass.
W. & J. broke into the run column 
in the second inning and increased its 
score every inning thereafter until the 
eighth. Boville was the heaviest slug
ger, making a single, a double, and a 
triple out of five times at bat. He 
scored two runs himself and drove in
two others, enough to win the game. 
Tech averted a shut out in the last 
inning. Brine singled and went to 
third on DeMuths hit, after Lain had 
flied out. The double steal was then 
worked successfully, Brine coming 
home and DeMuth reaching second, 
from which station he tallied on 
Humphries single. The score:

.ew Theories lxpounded on .atural 
Laws.
Mr. Reeze, the inventor of the 
sixty-pound generator which lights 
one hundred twenty-watt lamps 
brightly, spoke to the twenty odd 
members at the Mho Club meeting 
Wednesday evening, May 13th, at 
9:00 P. M. in Room 104, M. H.
Mr. Reeze was full of his subject, 
and he struggled to put his thoughts 
and findings clearly before his audi
ence; but they had difficulty in fol
lowing him. In the first place, Mr. 
Reeze believes that there is a prin
cipal acting in the universe which cre
ates matter. Everything is an equa
tion, he says; and while force is an 
unbalanced equation, matter is the 
effect or result of a balance between 
heat and cold.
In describing his generator, the 
laws of Ohm and Faraday seemed not 
to hold. His field magnets were 
wound with an attempt at no result
ing magnetism, and apparently his 
machine is based on static electricity. 
However, the fact that he actually 
does light lamps more economically 
than by existing methods exists; but 
whether it will ever be a practical 
success remains to be seen.
The business of the evening was 
principally a report of A. D. Moore 
as chairman of the committee on the 
reception for the Plebes, who elect 
Electrical Engineering, and this will 
probably be held in the Science Club 
room the last week in May.

O TEMPORA, O MORES!
The Following Mnteresting Mtems 
Have Appeared in Recent Mssues 
of The Daily Texan. 
Mmmodest Clothing.
Two or three dozen University girls 
are wearing clothing on the Campus 
and in the class rooms that is posi
tively immodest, to say the least. The 
increasing tendency in this direction 
recently has been watched with a 
great deal of apprehension. Many 
members of the faculty are thorough
ly disgusted. If the abuse is not cor
rected, the offending young women 
need not be surprised, and should not 
be offended, if they are sent away 
from class rooms and told to stay 
away until they can come properly 
clothed. They have long been offend
ing the sense of modesty that is in
herent in nine-tenths or more of the 
faculty and students, both men and 
women. If the offenders could hear 
the things that are said of them they 
would blush for shame, if they have 
enough modesty left to feel ashamed. 
These few are so notoriously conspic
uous that they are bringing unfavor
able criticism upon University girls 
in general. This is not fair to the 
great majority, who are decent, wear 
decent clothing and do not wish any 
reproach to be cast on the fair name 
of University girl.
One who is disgusted.
Two or three hundred University 
men are wearing clothing on the 
Campus and in the class rooms that 
is slightly transparent, to say the 
least. The writer will not assume to 
assert that the afore-mentioned wearContinued on next page

ing apparel is immodest. To many, 
the application of such a term to the 
noble sons of the gods immortal 
would be harsh and cruel in the ex
treme. No. no, we must not for a 
moment allow reproach to be cast 
upon the fair name of the young men 
of the University.
A poet of the past century began 
a poem' in this wise:
Ah, wasteful woman, . . .
Surely this could not be spoken of 
the modern University girl in re
gard to the use of summer dress ma
terial. And there is no gainsaying 
that the young men with their Palm 
Beach suits and silk shirts are pass
ing the women in the heated summer 
race back to nature. But our young 
menand they are all honorable men 
are not to be annoyed by blushes 
and such kindred evidences of mod
esty, for in matters of dress when 
comfort is involved, they have no 
sense of shame in either the past, pres
ent or future-perfect tense. They 
may walk through darkly lighted cor
ridors and experience no annoying 
sensationunless it be a feeling of 
envy when they see approaching from 
the opposite doorway a brother 
Apollo to whom Nature has been more 
kind and generous.
Give us fair play. Let us remember 
that men, as well as women, are 
prone to follow in the path of the zig
zag calf of fashion. When I hear the 
things that are said, and of which 
the writer in yesterdays Firing Line 
wrote, I am tempted to indulge in a 
bit of sarcasm and exclaim in the 
words of Avons immortal bard:
What a piece of work is Man;
How noble in reason;
How infinite in faculties;
In form and moving, how express and 
admirable;
In action, how like an angel;
In apprehension, how like a god! 
Another who is disgusted.
Why Are the airls Always the Tar
gets for Criticism?
Two or three dozen University boys 
and members of the faculty are wear
ing sheer Palm Beach suits on the 
Campus and in the class rooms, to the 
great embarrassment of the Univer
sity girls. The many offenders are 
so notoriously conspicuous that they 
are bringing unfavorable criticism 
upon the University men. This is not 
fair to the great majority who are 
decent, wear decent clothing and do 
not wish any reproach to be cast on 
the good name of the University 
gentlemen.
Many who are disgusted.
Mndecent Dressing.
Two or three hundred University 
students and several instructors are 
wearing clothing on the campus and 
in the class rooms that is positively 
indecent, to say the least. The in
creasing tendency to wear Palm Beach 
suits with a scarcity of other clothing 
is causing many modest and unassum
ing women students to blush with 
shame. If the offenders could hear
the things that are said of them, they 
would blush for shame, if they have 
enough modesty left to feel ashamed. 
This is not fair to the great majority 
who are decent, self-respecting, lawabiding gentlemen and who do not 
wish any reproach to be cast on the 
fair name of the University man.  
Another Disgusted One.
The controversy now being so heat
edly waged through The Texan as to 
Palm Beach suits, transparent skirts 
and other cooling extremes of fashion 
is both painful and tragic. Especially 
is this true since it has arrayed in 
the most bloodthirsty fashion the two 
sexes against each other. However,
I, man though I am unfortunate 
enough to be, wish to take the side of 
the three militant suffs who so 
boldly went after the apparel of the 
men students and the faculty members 
of the University. They are exactly 
right. There is nothing so suggestive 
and sensual as a veiled view of the 
male shank, such as the modest co-ed 
when gazing shinward, especially if 
the possessor be a professor. Think 
of it. A view, through a Palm Beach 
canvas, of a shapely, tempting, fas
cinating, alluring, enticing shank 
bone, upholstered with masculine skin, 
is enough to arouse all the unholy 
thoughts that sleep dormant within 
the bosoms of the fair guardians of 
our destinies. Men, in the name of 
decent living, beware!
Then, again, it has been maliciously 
and in the most dastardly fashion 
charged that certain of our young la
dies wear too few clothes. It has also
been hinted by some degenerate that 
their purpose in adorning themselves 
with fancy minnow seines and mos
quito bar is not simply and alone to 
prevent sweltering in the sweaty brine 
of Summers tortuous heat. This is 
horrible. Let the scoundrel who dares 
insinuate that our blushing girls would 
for a moment think of wearing the 
transparent, translucent, transcendent, 
transfigured skirt for any other pur
poses except those which surge in our 
breasts when we stop the iceman, pre
sent himself and receive the avalanche 
of condemnation that is ready to bear 
down upon him. It is coolness that 
our women demand today. The mod
ern skirt that so. beautifully lifts itself 
upon boarding a street car affords 
coolness to the ankles. The decollette, 
with its modest lowering about the 
neck and some six and three-quarter 
inches thereunder gives ventilation and 
cooling breezes to the throat and 
chest. The modern skirt then finished 
up the delightful plan by cooling off 
the rest of the body. For any man, 
who would dare call himself a man, to 
even intimate that our lovely lasses 
should forego, for the mere sake of 
covering up their person, this cooling 
process, is unthinkable. Let the girls 
cool off, I say, and let that human cur 
who would deny them the right to 
wear as little as they please be hound
ed from the face of the earth.
I am womans friend. Long ago I 
declared that if ever I married I would
give my wife a chance. Some men are 
not fit to marry a woman. I shall 
buy a churn, rent a cow, buy a wash
ing machine, purchase an electric iron 
and give my wife one-fourth of what 
she can make. I believe in justice.
I am for woman sufferage. Why, 
show me the white of the mans eyes 
who would step between a woman 
and her desire to suffer! His life 
would not be worth a penny in my 
hands. I say, give the women a 
chance. If she wants to show her an
kles, why shouldnt she? And if she 
is arrested and fined for having no 
visible means of support, Ill pay the 
fine. The day has come for men to 
keep in their places and tend to their 
own business. Heres one man who 
believes in womans rights to wear a 
dress made out of chicken wire, pro
viding it will keep her cool.
In conclusion, let me say I do hope 
the men will be more modest about 
the Campus. We are living in a day 
of fierce tendencies and awful temp
tations. Man as the guardian of mod
esty and the friend of pure thought 
should clothe himself in such a man
ner as not to attract attention to his 
physical self. Let the warning of the 
three heroic young ladies be warning 
sufficient.
Let Us Have oeace.
Reading the communications of 
three of our girls in todays Texan, 
one must conclude that there are sev
eral pebbles on the Palm Beach. The 
little pebbles are the male students; 
the big pebbles, certain members of 
the faculty. In the contest now being 
waged for a display of human beauty 
both sides are well represented. 
When it comes to a show-down, to a 
pulling-off contest, it is hard to de
cide to whom should be awarded the 
palnT, the men or the women. We, 
as an on-looker, feel constrained to 
say that it looks like Beauty un
adorned is adorned the most would 
win out. Others think that this con
test has gone far enough; that we 
should not display our defects to a 
gainsaying world. Let us cover up 
our imperfections, hide our shame, 
as it were. Let us have peace.

AT SALly, VHl'V.
Monday, April 20, seven Senior Me
chanicals left Pennsylvania station at
9 oclock for Salem, under the guid
ance of Mr. Estep. Before the card 
game was finished, we drew a sigh 
and dropped off the train. When we 
reached the plant of the Buckeye En
gine Co., on our way to the hotel, our 
watches read 11 oclock, so that we 
began to make several appropriate re
marks about lunch. We were in
formed that, since Salem time was a 
little slower than Pittsburgh time, we 
would have a couple of hours to look 
over the plant. Lunch over, we 
trouped back to the plant and, after 
covering our identity with the con
ventional white, ran a three hour pre
liminary test on the Buckeye-Mobile 
in order to become familiar with the 
outfit before the real test on Tuesday.
The Buckeye-mobile is a unit power 
plant copied almost exactly from Ger
man locomobile practice. It consists 
of a fire tube boiler, superheater, and 
reheater in a cylindrical shell, on which 
is mounted a tandem compound en
gine with the cylinders jocketed by 
hot gases from the smoke box. The 
gear pump for the surface condenser, 
and the boiler feed pump are belted 
to the engine shaft. These plant are 
built in sizes from 75 to 600 H. P., 
the unit tested being of 225 B.H.P.
The test began at 8 oclock Tuesday 
and continued ten hours. Indicator 
cards were taken every 15 minutes; 
as well as readings of steam, and flue 
temperatures; steam pressure at throt
tle, and in receiver; draft above great, 
and in flue; and Orsot readings. A 
throttling calorimeter was placed in 
the steam line between the boiler and 
superheater and the moisture in the 
steam computed. Condenser readings 
were also taken. The coal and water 
used were weighed every hour.
All day Wednesday the wrecking 
crew wrestled with planimeter and 
slide rule, and at seven o'clock the 
results were all inso were the Sen
ior Mechanicals. A mans size ten
derloin steak, followed by a little game 
closed each day, since there were no 
other amusements in the town.
On Thursday, till train time, the fin
ishing touches were put on, and Mac 
finished the data sheet tracing while 
some of the boys succeeded in com
bining a couple of indicator cards.
