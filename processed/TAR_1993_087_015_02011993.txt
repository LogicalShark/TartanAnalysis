Volume 87. Issue 15Carnegie Mellon University. Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania1 February 1993Student Senate passes new funding legislation
By FRANK MICHELS
Tartan Assistant News Editor
Last Tuesday, Student Senate passed 
legislation that allows Senate to confis
cate the property of student organiza
tions funded by Senate who violate 
Senates fiscal policy. The bill numbered 
'93S-08, proposed by MCS Senator 
Michael Tomblyn, passed by a vote of 
1642.
Because of legislation 93S-08, Article 
VI, Section XX, Sub-Section A of Stu
dent Senates bylaws now reads as fol
lows: Violations of Student Senate Fis
cal Policy may result in... [the] immedi
ate impoundment of an organizations 
Student Senate-allocated funds and 
equipment purchased by said funds by 
the Funding & Recognition Committee 
(F&R), pending an investigation ...
It occurred to me that if Student Sen
ate is able to impound Student Senateallocated funds and groups used those 
funds to purchase equipment for the
group, then it only makes sense that 
equipment belongs to the student body, 
said Tomblyn, who is also vice chair of 
Senate. He said that this amendment 
was necessary for the impoundment of 
capital equipment in particular, which 
equipment is valued at over $1,000. 
Groups dont bring in 
more than $1,000 from 
members. Its a safe as
sumption that [equip
ment] was bought with the 
Student Activities Fee, 
said Tomblyn.
This is tangible evi
dence that Student Sen55555* 
ate is working to protect 
the interests of the student body. We are 
out here to protect their interests, said 
Tomblyn. He said that Student Senate 
can do this, but not that they must. The 
amendment would only be used if a 
group commits a grievous act against 
the bylaws, said Tomblyn.
GSIA Senator Michael Loomis, former
F&R chair, voted for the amendment, 
saying that the bill will be very useful if 
an organization becomes abusive. 
Loomis said, Student Senate allocated 
money for the students, not for student 
groups. The property of student organi
zations are property of the students, not
The property of student organiza
tions are property of the students, 
not of the clubs.
 GSIA Senator Michael Loomis
of the clubs. According to Loomis, the 
property of defunct organizations be
come the property of Student Senate to 
give to other organizations, but the 
amendment would only be used in dire 
emergencies."
Loomis said that the argument does 
exist in which Student Senate cannot
magically" say what equipmentbelongs 
to it. It is a fantasy; you cant make such 
a distinction," said Loomis, who also 
said that Student Senate will be afraid 
of taking action on it unless there is a 
strong need for it.
Another GSIA Senator, Michel Robe, 
attempted to change the amend
ment to say that Student Sen
ate could only impound equip
ment that was purchased 
solely by allocated funds. The 
vote to amend the amendment 
failed in the eyes of the chair. 
Robe, therefore, voted against 
the amendment as proposed. 
People may have put their own 
money into equipment. Therefore, Stu
dent Senate doesnt have the right to 
confiscate the equipment unless it was 
purchased solely on the Student Activi
ties Fee, said Robe. He said that this 
amendment is a preventive measure to 
assure that the last members of organi
zations shouldnt run away with [their]
equipment.
Its a fair amendment. It gives us the 
power to tako back what was bought 
with the Student Activities Fee, said 
MCS Senator Tony DeRoss, who ab
stained from voting. He said that ini
tially he was for the amendment, but 
when the amendment was put into dif
ferent accounts, he thought that abstain
ing was the fair thing to do.
Loomis is currently working on an 
amendment that would define where 
the property of organizations would go if 
they became defunct.
The passed amendment was one of 
eight amendments all proposed by 
Tomblyn. Most were simple grammati
cal and clarifying amendments that re
worded some of the bylaws.
However, proposal 93S-09 attempted 
to remove the referendum from the By
laws. Tomblyn said that it was no longer 
necessary, since any issue can be brought 
up with a new issue petition. The pro
posal failed by a vote of 3-18-1.Cable News Network

Because of the amount of scien
tific research at CMU, most mem
bers of the campus community 
are fairly accustomed to technol
ogy. Once in a while, this casual 
nonchalance is interrupted when 
some of the Universitys techni
cal triumphs make the national 
media spotlight.
That happened last week when 
reporters from Cable News Net
work (CNN) spent 
three days on cam
pus interviewing 
esearchers in a 
series of technol
ogy updates to be 
broadcast nation
wide.
The interviews, _
which took place ^ 
last Tuesday 
throughlastThursday, were part 
of an ongoing series of CNN Sci
ence and Technology program 
segments devoted to ground
breaking research in areas of in
terest to the general public.
A1 Hinman, the CNN reporter 
covering the stories, thinks the
interesting projects. There were 
four times as many stories avail
able as we had time to do, said 
Hinman.
One story that Hinman and 
CNN camera operator Mike 
Dolsak were able to cover in de
tail was the ongoing process of 
automating the Universitys li
braries in order to allow people to 
more easily use the librarys re
sources from within the library, 
from other parts of campus, or 
even from off-campus.
Theres an amazing amount of 
interesting projects. There were 
four times as many stories avail
able as we had time to do.
 Al Hinman, CNN reporter
This is the toughest story to 
make really new, said Hinman, 
adding that almost everyone is 
already familiar with computer 
terminals in libraries.
It was left to Computer Science 
Department head Jim Morris to 
describe to the CNN audience 
how the Universitys library sysTo demonstrate how he would 
use the electronic library, Morris 
paged through a list of papers 
written by computer science re
searchers and then selected one 
to look at more closely.
The interesting thing about 
this system is that it has the 
original article with pictures. 
Most library systems can show 
[the article abstract], but ours 
can show the actual image of the 
article, said Morris as he looked 
through the research 
paper.
The important 
thing is that I dont 
have to go to the li
brary. Ive been able 
to do my research 
without leaving my 
computer, said the 
computer scientist.
 According to
Charles Lowry, university librar
ies administrator, the ability to 
access pictures of documents, 
rather then just brief summaries 
of them, is part of a trend affect
ing all libraries.
Said Lowry, New technologies 
are again transforming the model 
of the library. We are seeing elecPlease see CNN, page 4

The mail services on campus look like theyll be 
going through some changes in the future. Not only 
are changes in the distribution of campus mail 
being proposed, but a move of the Baker Hall post 
office to the Naval Reserve building is being planned 
for this summer.
The changes are in response to the limited space 
that exists presently in Baker Hall. H&SS has long 
requested access to the Bpace presently taken by 
the post office to convert to much-needed class
rooms.
At present, the Baker Hall office is the center for 
the distribution of cam
pus mail and is the only 
post office window on the 
main campus of Carnegie 
Mellon. Window service 
is planned to move to the 
Naval building in August 
with a proposal to move 
campus mail distribution 
several miles off campus to the Eichleay building 
in Point Breeze.
Neal Binstock, the director of Business Services, 
said that the move will not have any noticeable 
changes on the campus. He said, There will still 
always be window service on campus ... that ser
vice must be maintained." Binstock said that the 
moving of distribution to the Eichleay building will 
only be a change in the back room operations of the 
mail service, and even though campus mail will be 
less centralized, Binstock is confident that the
quality of service will not change. Binstock said, 
Im going to make sure [service] is better than it is 
now.
Among the scenarios being proposed is the addi
tion of commuter mailboxes in the Naval building 
post-office, that will give commuters a central 
place with which to receive mail on campus and 
will also save departments the expense of mailing 
off-campus.
However, the Naval Reserve building may not be 
the permanent home of the post office. I would like 
to see a student mail center in the new student 
center, said Binstock.
Jan ChriBty, the campuB postmaster, had no
ticed concern from many students. She said that a 
lot of people have 
asked, Are you mov
ing?" Christy also said 
.that the post office 
doesnt yet know 
where in the Naval 
building they shall be 
moved. We dont have 
a determined amount 
of space, or where theyre going to send us, she 
said.
Binstock estimates that over six million pieces of 
incoming and outgoing mail pass through the postal 
services yearly and that amongst the campus mail 
nearly 92 percent are delivered within the next 
day. Thats not good enough forme, said Binstock. 
Thomas Lawrence, manager of University Receiv
ing and Stores, echoes Binstocks optimism. 
Lawrence said, If anything does move it wont 
affect service.
There will still always be 
window service on campus.

EC displeased with recent U.S. steel tariffs
BRUSSELS, January 29 (AP)  An
ger over steel trade tariffs imposed by 
the U.S. ttys week provides ammunition 
for the protectionist wing of the Euro
pean Community (EC) at a sensitive 
time, The Wall Street Journal reported.
The provisional U.S. antidumping pen
alties come just as the free traders of 
Northern Europe are facing off against 
the generally more protectionist south
ern countries in a struggle for the soul of 
EC trade policy. At issue are the ECs 
negotiating tactics at the world trade 
talks in Geneva, as well as a proposal to 
give its Executive Commission more 
power in imposing its own antidumping 
measures.
Reacting to the U.S. plan in an inter
view with BBC Radio, British Trade 
Minister Richard Needham said, I do 
think that it doesnt bode well for the
future of the world trading system if this 
sort of thing is allowed to continue. 
The French spoke of retaliation. If 
the American administration heads up 
the path of protectionism, countermea
sures will be necessary in Europe," Prime 
Minister Pierre Beregovoy said at a newB 
conference in Paris. I hope that the 
Americans will think twice.
Frances hard line against offering 
trade concessions to the U.S. has helped 
stall efforts to work out a complex series 
of compromises at the Geneva talks, 
held under the auspices of the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).
The ECs new trade commissioner, Sir 
Leon Brittan, is pushing hard for a GATT 
deal with the U.S. and about 100 other 
nations involved in the talks. Brittan, a 
fervent free trader, is due to press the 
issue February 11 atameetingin Washington with Mickey Kantor, the new 
U.S. trade representative. Despite 
Brittans professed optimism, however, 
many other EC officials are increasingly 
gloomy about chances of a breakthrough 
in the six-year-old GATT negotiations.
Much will depend, of course, on what 
kind of positions the Clinton adminis
tration takeB towards GATT. Clinton 
aides have sent out only vague signals 
on GATT so far, but our impression is 
that it will be even more difficult to 
reach an accord with the new U.S. ad
ministration than it was with former 
President George Bush, a senior French 
diplomat said.
Meanwhile, EC member states remain 
split over the Commissions proposal to 
strengthen its ability to impose anti
dumping duties and other trade sanc
tions. That impasse has prevented thethink that it doesnt bode well for the issue February 11 atameetingin Washtions. That impasse has prevented the of member
Debate rages in D.C. over military ban
WASHINGTON, January 29 then Republicans will move for a dent said earlier in the day that of last Thursday nights meetini
EC from approving a related package of 
measures that would establish common 
quotas for certain products imported 
from China, Eastern Europe, the former 
Soviet republics, and several other coun
tries.
At present, provisional antidumping 
duties imposed by the EC executive body 
must be approved by a qualified major
ity of member states under a voting 
system that gives greater weight to larger 
countries. In other words, a minority of 
EC states, usually led by Germany and 
Britain, can block the Commission when 
they feel it is going too far in protecting 
EC industries from overseas competi
tion.
Last year, the Commission proposed a 
streamlined system under which duties 
would stand unless a qualified majority 
of members opposed them.
That proposal has been blocked For 
more than six months by the free-tradeoriented membersGermany, Britain, 
the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Den
mark. They have argued that the new 
system would make it too easy for the 
Commission to impose duties.
In an effort to end the impasse, ths 
Commission this week proposed a compromise under which a simple majority 
or seven of the 12 member states, could 
overturn duties. n
Although that system would make it 
slightly more difficult for the Commission to have its way, officials from Ger
many, Britain, Luxembourg, and thfc 
Netherlands indicated that they 
wouldnt accept the compromise.
A Danish official said it was too early 
to say whether the compromise would 
prove acceptable.
WASHINGTON, January 29 
(DJ)President Bill Clinton and 
Senator Sam Nunn hit a snag in 
the fragile agreement they 
reached Wednesday on handling 
the lifting of the ban on homo
sexuals in the military, but the 
White House is still expected to 
announce today a plan to begin 
lifting the ban, The Wall Street 
Journal reported.
The issue was whether homo
sexuals in the military would be 
discharged during the interim 
period between Clintons an
nouncement that he intends to 
lift the ban by the middle of the 
year, and the actual lifting of the 
ban.
Even if Nunn and the Presi
dent reach an agreement, major 
obstacles still remain. Bob Dole 
said Senate Republicans probably 
would react to White House ac
tion on homosexuals in the mili
tary by introducing legislation to 
codify the existing military ban.
If he starts making changes,
then Republicans will move for a 
vote, Dole asserted. Not ques
tioning recruits and not punish
ing homosexuals, he said, would 
be a change, and that would trig
ger action. These actions, Dole 
predicted, would probably be ini
tiated by the end of this week.
The President, supported by 
homosexual groups, hoped to an
nounce a moratorium on military 
discharges of homosexuals, while 
Congress debated lifting the ban 
and the Pentagon worked out 
details of the action. Nunn, sup
ported by the military, had ar
gued for continuing the dis
charges.
Last Thursday evening, a com
promise was discussed under 
which homosexuals could be 
transferred, but not discharged, 
during the interim period, sim
ply for being homosexual.
It appears that homosexual con
duct as opposed to orientation 
 still will be prohibited during 
the interim period. The President said earlier in the day that 
he agreed with the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff that any sort of improper 
conduct Bhould result in sever
ance. What constitutes im
proper conduct, however, is at 
the heart of the debate. Military 
officers define the phrase as any 
homosexual activity, while gay 
activists define it as sexual as
sault, harassment, or other vio
lations.
Under the agreement ham
mered out in rounds of meetings 
this week between the White 
HouBe, Pentagon, and members 
of the Senate, Clinton is likely to 
announce today a two-stops-andone-start plan.
First, the military immediately 
will stop asking recruits about 
their Bexual orientation. This is 
likely to prove relatively uncontroversial because the Joint 
Chiefs already have told Presi
dent Clinton that they would ac
cept this provision.
The second stop, the subject
of last Thursday nights meeting, 
is an immediate moratorium on 
discharging personnel for simply 
being homosexual.
The White House and Penta
gon would then start figuring out 
how the ban might be lifted, on 
the apparent understanding that 
before the White House acts, it 
will present its proposal to Con
gress for a vote.
Whatever agreements are 
reached are sure to be tested in 
the courts while a ban is being 
debated. Indeed, even as last 
weeks meeting was beginning, 
the news arrived that a federal 
judge in Los Angeles had ruled 
that the Navys ban on homo
sexuals is unconstitutional.
According to wire service re
ports, U.S. District Judge Terry 
Hatter said he was barring the 
Navy from discharging or deny
ing enlistment to any person 
based on sexual orientation. The 
decision concerned Petty Officer 
Keith Meinhold.
Economy affects Japanese buying ability
NEW YORK, January 27 (DJ) 
 A few years ago it looked as if 
Japan was going to buy up the 
United States. But not any moro.
Japanese corporations have 
fallen on hard times and their 
appotito for U.S. acquisitions iB 
much diminished. At the same 
time, Japans investors aredumping U.S. stocks willy nilly, The 
Wall Street Journal reported.
Burdened by slowing economic 
growth at home, a past record of 
overpaying for overseas acquisi
tions and a wounded domestic 
financial system, Japanese com
panies spent only $1.92 billion on 
publicly-reported takeovers and 
related deals in the U.S. last year, 
down 50 percent from the $3.85 
billion they shelled out in 1991. 
The total number of deals fell to 
78 from 122 the year before, ac
cording to the Japan M&A Re
porter, published by Ulmer Broth
ers Inc., a New York investment 
bank.
Japanese investors also have 
been retreating from the U.S. 
stock market. In the first three 
quarters of 1992, they sold a net
$4.2 billion of U.S. shares, ac
cording to the Securities Indus
try Association.
"What once looked like an en
during maelstrom of Japanese 
investment now more clearly ap
pears to have been a unique 
confluence of economic factors, 
which are unlikely to repeat 
themselves for many years, if 
ever, said Daniel M. Schwartz;, 
managing director at Ulmer 
Brothers.
Among those factors were a 
strong yen, high-flying Japanese 
stock and real estate markets, 
low interest rates and fast eco
nomic growth with low inflation. 
In addition, corporate profits were 
soaring, and Japan was liberaliz
ing its capital markets, which 
made foreign investments look a 
lot more appealing than the low 
yields available in Japan.
You had a lot of money looking 
for a home, said Schwartz. Much 
of that money went abroad.
Now a lot of it is returning 
home to shore up crumbling bal
ance sheets. The main motiva
tion behind the sell-off of U.S.
stocks is the repatriation of as
sets back into Japan, primarily 
to augment Japanese corporate 
profits which are relatively weak, 
said Peter Davies, a vice presi
dent at Nomura Securities Co. in 
New York.
Japanese takeover deals used 
to be the stuff of headlines. In 
1990, for instance, Matsushita 
Electric Industries Co. paid $6.1 
billion for MCA Inc. And in 1989, 
when Japanese takeover activity 
peaked at $13.7 billion, five ac
quisitions cost more than $500 
million each.
By contrast, 1992stwo biggest 
transactions were valued at $350 
million each. In one, Kyoei Steel 
Ltd. bought Florida Steel Corp. 
The other deal involved a multi
national effort in which Japan 
Air Lines Co., Nissho Iwai Corp., 
andDeutsche LufthansaAGtook 
control of air courier service op
erator DHL International Ltd.
Japanese companies still enjoy 
the advantage of a strong yen. 
But financing for possible deals 
is either lacking or much more 
expensive than it once was.
Japanese corporate earnings 
are expected to decline in 1993 
forthethirdyearinarow.Japans 
banking system is reeling from a 
combination of bad real estate 
loans, increased bankruptcies, 
and new international capitaladequacy guidelines. In addition, 
the Japanese stock market has 
plunged.
The Japanese retreat goes be
yond the U.S. Japanese acquisi
tions in Europe fell off a cliff, 
said Schwartz. In 1992, Japans 
industrial companies and finan
cial institutions paid $424 mil
lion for European companies, less 
than a fifth of the $2.3 billion 
they spent the year before.
Investment bankers dont see 
Japanese takeovers roaring back 
soon. Koichiro Okita, a vice presi
dent at Nomura, predicts that 
Japanese companies will ratio
nalize their U.S. operations, in
vest more selectively, and con
centrate on taking minority 
stakes rather than control.
Moreover, he expects some 
Japanese companies to begin sell
ing off their U.S. units.
Nations compete 
for Iraqi oil deals
BAGHDAD, January 29 (AP) 
Several European oil compa
nies are negotiating secret con
tracts with Iraq to tap its enor
mous petroleum reserves after 
international sanctions are 
lifted, according to Iraqi busi
nessmen and United Nations 
officials, The Wall Street Jour
nal reported.
And after some not-so-subtle 
hints from Saddam Husseins 
government, some foreign com
panies hoping to do business 
with Iraq are sweetening the 
pot up front with donations of 
humanitarian relief supplies to 
the embargoed nation.
Some Western companies 
are findingthat by sending food 
and medicines, they can main
tain a certain level of contact 
with Iraqi officials, said a rep
resentative of foreign compa
nies here.
The arrangements under dis
cussion include concessions for 
foreign companies to develop 
certain Iraqi oil fields for as 
many as 20 years, barter deals 
of technology for oil, and 
straight oil sales, said Iraqis 
close to the countrys oil minis
try.
The talks, which one U.N. of
ficial said have already resulted 
in several letters of intent 
signed by foreign companies 
with Iraq, do not violate Secu
rity Council sanctions, provided 
the transactions dont occur 
until the United Nations em
bargo is lifted.
But, the willingness of some 
Western countries and not oth
ers  notably the U.S.  to 
allow commercial contacts with 
Iraq raises the question of 
whether a head start now could 
give some companies a leg up 
later. Indeed, one Iraqi busi
nessman with close ties to Iraqs 
oil bureaucracy argues that 
American oil companies are 
being left behind, as the 
worlds second-largest oil re
serves are divided up for future 
development.
The British and the French 
bombed Baghdad, and theyre
talking to Iraq, says this Iraqi,; 
who favors U.S. participation. 
Why arent the Americans?
Iraqi officials refuse to discuss 
details of their contacts with 
eign companies, except to a 
knowledge considerable interest 
abroad in re-establishing com
mercial links with Iraq. An Iraqi 
close to the oil ministry said rep
resentatives of companies in Brit
ain, France, Germany, a 
Greece have held talks with Ira
qis in Baghdad and Europe.
They are sticking to the em
bargo in policy terms, but there is 
a will from many companies', to 
discuss the future, said Iraq's 
minister of trade, Mohammed 
Mehdi Saleh.
As for the donations of relief 
supplies, humanitarian aid to 
Iraq isnt restricted under the 
U.N. embargo. But the unex
pected size of corporate contribu
tions has helped Hussein main
tain his rule.
The U.N. Sanctions Commit
tee in New York doesnt keep tabs 
on who pays for humanitarian 
shipments to Iraq, so identififdtion of the specific donors is vir
tually impossible. But U.N. offi
cials who track aid to Iraq said 
corporate contributions help ex
plain how Husseins regime has 
sustained key imports of sugar, 
rice, wheat, and tea since Sep
tember, when the Security Coun
cil barred it from using frozen 
assets abroad to buy food. U.N. 
officials also report that the Ira
qis have recently become much 
more direct on the subject of phi
lanthropy.
Says a senior U.N. official con
nected to food distribution in Iraq, 
My contacts at the Iraqi Foreign 
Ministry are saying that a IB?* 
friend is a friend in need. If W 
one canmake a good gesture now, 
they say it will be doubly appreci
ated later.

SEI, SCS create new degree program
gy FRANK MICHELS
Tartan Assistant News Editor
The School ofComputer Science (SCS) 
and the Software Engineering Institute 
(SEI), in response to the increasing de
mand for software engineers, have com
bined their resources into a new fasttrack, five-year program leading to the 
bachelors degree in computer science 
and a masters in software engineering 
(BS/MSE). According to Mary Shaw, 
associate dean for professional programs 
at'SCS, This program offers a degree 
forpeople determined for the discipline 
of Software engineering. There are very 
few other opportunities for students to 
include a substantial design experience 
in,a high-quality degree program.
. .The core of the BS/MSE program con
sists of a twoor three-year series of 
summer internships that would have 
students working on software for such 
companies as Apple Computer, Inc., 
General Electric Co., Microsoft Corp., 
Motorola, Inc., and NCR Corp. Sopho
more and junior mathematics/computer 
science majors would participate in the 
internship program while engaging in 
their undergraduate studies. The in
ternships give students exposure to softmb k nU4CesdD Ur eas oUreilCs v,tN,ssCN,t y,deNe4es
ware development, since the stand-alone 
MSE program requires a minimum of 
two years of work experience in the soft
ware industry as a prerequisite for ad
mission, according to the MSE program 
directory.
The MSE course of study is appor
tioned 30 percent to core courses, 40 
percent to the Software Design Studio, 
and 30 percent to electives. After com
pleting the internships and a faculty 
review, seniors work toward an MSE by 
taking core courses while finishing the 
mathematics/computer science under
graduate degree. The core curriculums 
focus is on practicing the discipline of 
software engineering, which is centered 
around five themes: engineering design, 
technical management, mathematical 
modeling, distributed systems, and hu
man resources management.
The fifth year of the BS/MSE degree 
program is devoted to special courses 
and the Software Development Studio, 
which is another part of the MSE pro
gram where teams of students evaluate 
and work on projects for customers such 
as Boeing Co., NASA, and SEI. Accord
ing to Jim Tomayko, a senior member of 
the SEI technical staff, coordinator of 
the Software Development Studio and 
adjunct professor in the Mellon College 
of Science, Most [undergraduate] stu
dents have experience with program
ming butnoton large-scale maintenance, 
configuration management, and quality 
assurance. We wanted our students to 
have that experience.
Mark Stehlik, assistant dean for un
dergraduate education at SCS, advises 
students in the undergraduate program 
of mathematics/computer science. He 
says, Combining internships with the 
[Software Development Studio] gives 
students something they cant find in 
the classroom, a sense of the corporate 
life of software, which involves reacting
to customer needs and being involved in 
a products ongoing marketability.
The new BS/MSE degree came as a 
response to an increasing demand for 
software engineers from industries, ac
cording to an earlier CMU press release. 
A committee was established in Decem
ber 1991 to review how SCS could be 
improved, andin June 1992, members of 
SCS and SEI conglomerated to establish 
the new five-year degree. Stehlik says 
that this degree is beneficial because 
industries are starting to require more 
than a four-year degree. Tomayko says, 
Good students in the computer science 
department may go somewhere else in
stead of getting a masters degree here. 
He also says that because of MSEs twoyear work experience requirement, com
panies were not sending employees to 
get a masters degree, due to the reces
sion.
Stehlik says that the BS/MSE will 
most likely expand in the next few years 
for two reasons. First, Stehlik says, 
Companies were very interested in our 
program so they can sponsor intern
ships. According to Tomayko, compa
nies expressed a serious interest in par
ticipating, because they normally see 
students for only an hour during an 
interview, but with [this] program, com
panies can see them for over a year. 
Second, Students are starting to see 
that the masters program is useful to 
position themselves in the job market.... 
Software professionals graduate [from] 
this program.
This year, six sophomores and two 
juniors are participating in this degree 
program. Sophomore and junior math
ematics/computer science majors can 
apply in the fall semester, with a recom
mendation, a transcript, and a state
ment of purpose. Information on the 
new degree is available from the SCS 
Undergraduate Office, Wean 4102.
Student organizations to move into Naval building
By MING CHNG
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
The student organizations in Skibo 
will be moved to the Nnval building, 
accordi ng to Assistant Vice President 
of Planning and Budget Jeffrey 
Bolton. A new facility for the Naval 
personnel is presently being built in 
North Versailles whichshouldbe com
pleted by fall of this year. Discussions 
with the Naval personnel are taking 
place at present to get them to move 
out of the buildingin August with the 
relocation of student organizations 
taking place immediately after that. 
Pending agreement from the Navy, 
networking facilities are to be ex
tended to the Naval building during 
the summer.
With the destruction of Skibo, the 
Tartan Grill and Salads Plus would 
cease to exist. CMDS is planning to 
deploy more food carts around cam
pus to take the place of Kiltie Court. 
The facilities at Highlander and 
Morewood Gardens will also be beefed 
up to take up some of the slack.
Building and Design is also looking 
into modifications to the Naval buildThe Naval Reserve 
Building, located be
tween the University 
Computing Center and 
Hamburg Hall, Is the 
subject of negotiations 
between University 
development and Naval 
ROTC.

val building will 
also be renovated 
with improvoments in the ven
tilation system 
and sanitation fa
cilities.
Bolton said that 
a committee is reviewing the changes 
necessary to facilitate the relocation 
of student organizations from Skibo to 
the Naval building. At present, every
thing is in the planning stage with 
nothing definite as negotiations con
tinue with the Naval personnel. Sev
eral subcommittees are going to be 
formed soon to talk to university rep
resentatives about the proposed 
changes, according to Bolton.
According to the tentative schedule, 
Skibo is due to come down in June, 
although budget problems may force 
the postponement of demolition yet 
again. The construction of the new 
student center is scheduled to span 30 
months and be completed in Septem
ber 1995.

Correction...
In last week's story Former Chief Justice dies, former 
Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshalls alma mater was 
reported incorrectly. Marshall received his degree from Howard 
Law School. Also, Marshall was not Chief Justice at any time.
In last weeks story Six Student Senators resign, former 
CFA senator Moneet Singhs class was reported incorrectly. 
Singh is a senior architecture major.
In last weeks story Senate creates separate Human Re

Dean of Heinz School of Public Policy announces resignation
By KENDRICK K. CHUA
Tartan News Editor
Alfred Blumstein, dean of the 
Heinz School of Public Policy and 
Management, announced his res
ignation last Wednesday. He 
plans to remain a part of the 
faculty and continue teaching in 
the Heinz School. Blumstein has 
been dean for the past seven 
years.
Im really proud of the status 
which the Heinz School has at
tainted, of widespread respect and 
appreciation, and that it has be
come a major public policy insti
tution of which the University 
can be proud, said Blumstein. 
Thats attributable to the excel
lence of the faculty, the staff, and 
the students and alumni. Blum
stein expects the University to 
complete its search for a replace
ment by December. Blumstein 
said in a memo addressed to the 
Heinz School Community that he 
would remain dean until a suc
cessor was hired by the Univer
sity.
The same memo also contained 
Blumsteins assessment of the 
Heinz Schools accomplishments 
and future goals. In particular,
the Heinz School has been the 
recipient of a total of 26 research 
grants since Blumstein became 
dean. Also, the school established 
a Master of Arts Management 
program collaboratively with the 
College of Fine Arts. However, 
Blumstein indicated in the memo 
that he felt the Heinz School 
needed to gain recognition among 
non-professional people and re
main aware of national public 
policy.
I think the school and its fac
ulty are poised for an increas
ingly important role in the nation 
as the new administration in 
Washington begins to turn its 
attention to the serious domestic 
problems facing the nation, said 
Blumstein. We have been work
ing for the past number of years 
to build the base of excellence 
that has placed our faculty in a 
position of intellectual leadership, 
and our alumni will become ma
jor players in the evolving pro
grams.
Blumstein graduated with a 
doctorate in operations research 
from Cornell University and has 
been the president of many pub
lic policy organizations, includ
ing the Institute of Management
Sciences and the Operations Re
search Society of America. He 
has also served on many state 
and national committees on law
enforcement and crime, includ
ing the Presidents Commission 
on Law Enforcement and Admin
istration of Justice.

Manager of CMU cluster services resigns
By STEPH STINE
Tartan Staffwriter
Effective today, Gaiy Aulfinger 
resigned as cluster services man
ager.
Aulfinger has enrolled in the 
Heinz School as a full-time stu
dent in order to complete his 
masters degree in Public Policy 
and Management this spring.
There will not be an immediate 
replacement for Aulfinger. Com
puting Services will be review
ing cluster operations during the 
coming semester, said Tracey 
Futhey, head of Computing Ser
vices, in a bboard post.
Futhey was Aulfingers super
visor duringhis tenure as cluster 
services manager. Meanwhile, 
Aulfingers responsibilities will 
be assumed by Futhey who will 
be assisted by a student coordi
nator.
As of today, all electronic mail 
inquiries that would be sent to 
Aulfinger regarding Cluster Ser
vices should be addressed to
clusters+@andrew.cmu.edu.
Aulfinger said he was opti
mistic regarding the future of 
Computing Services, specifically 
the cluster facilities.
In the past, changes in the 
computer clusters were effected 
with no specific goal in mind, 
accordingto Aulfinger, who said 
that he hoped that future modi
fications will be direction-ori
ented.
As cluster services manager, 
Aulfinger oversaw the hiring as 
well as the training of computer 
consultants. He also directed 
changes pertaining to the clus
ters, such as the purchase of 
new software.
Aulfinger has been a full-time 
staffmemberofComputingServices since January, 1988.

tronic text and electronic ac
cess to traditional library ma
terials emerge. Until now, li
braries have been primarily 
identified as place, but we are 
in motion towards ... a virtual 
or electronic library.
Because a virtual library is a 
body of information more sub
ject to artificial computer-defined boundaries rather than 
traditional ones such as rooms 
and buildings, the idea poses 
some challenges to researchers.
Vice President of Computing 
Services William Arms told 
Hinman and Dolsak the Uni
versity is trying to solve those 
problems.
Clearly, the copyright and 
legal issues are profound. How
ever, most academic publishers 
are experimenting [with pos
sible solutions], said Arms.
But, said the administra
tor, were really working on a 
25-year project. Were build-; 
ing on the expectations of 
things to come.
If you look at the way faculty 
communicate with students, 
they use many forms ofmedia. 
The idea is to move informa

as possible.
In response, Hinman asked 
how hard it was to avoid being 
locked into one type of com-,., 
puter system which might need. 
to be changed later at great, 
expense.
Arms said, You build things 
out of components, and the 
components communicate. As - 
long as you have good compor

The old joke in computing is, r

Alex Waibel, a senior research computer scientist in the Schoolof 
Computer Science (SCS) and principal investigator of the Janus 
project, said that by combining neural networks with more tradi
tional technologies, it increases the systems accuracy and efficiency. 
Waibel added that portions of the system can be adopted to other 
domains and languages as well.
Further plans on the Janus system will include making the system 
handle interruptions and broken sentences more easily, enlarging 
the vocabulary, and adding new languages. Waibel said that he also 
plans to include multi-modal capabilities into Janus, including 
gesture, lip, and face recognition. mi
Waible said that speech recognition and translation has taken

1/16, FIGHT, 11:12 pm. Campus Po
lice were informed that a fight between 
members of two fraternities was in 
progress on the porch of one of the houses. 
When officers responded, several physi
cal altercations had to be broken up, 
including several that started again aftertheir arrival. One officer was punched 
in the side of the face, knocking off his 
glasses. After all the fights were stopped, 
the members were ordered back to their 
respective houses.

with a wagon and patrol car for back-up.
; Members of one fraternity, and their 
guests from another chapter of the fra
ternity, had to be told several times to go 
;back to their house, which they eventu
ally did, though they returned after a 
few minutes. The house received an in
ternal citation for failing to obey a Uni
versity official. The fight stemmed from 
a previous altercation sometime the day 
before.
Two students were injured. One suf
fered a bloody nose and lip, and refused 
medical treatment and transportation. 
A second victim suffered a possible bro
ken left wrist and was transported to 
Presbyterian Hospital. No arrests were 
made because the fight was a mutual 
action. Both houses were warned that if 
-ihsre are any further physical fights, 
arrests would result.

been having an argument in the stair
well of the house, and the student 
punched out two panes of wire mesh 
safety glass from the stairwell window.

The student said she had asked the man 
his name two times, and he had given 
her two different names. She said that

FORUM
Everyone must work 
for a safer campus
The physical well-being of ev
ery member of the campus com
munity has to be one of the high
est priorities for Carnegie 
Mellon University as a whole. 
Campus Police does what it can 
but cannot do everything on its 
own. Maintaining a safe cam
pus requires the cooperation of 
the administration and students 
in addition to Campus Police.
Some of the necessary safety 
improvements will cost money. 
We suggest that the University 
consider the cost as an invest
ment in the well-being of the 
entire community. Many areas 
of campus, especially Frew 
Street, Margaret Morrison 
Street, the Mall, and the Cut 
need much better lighting. The 
. University must install several 
additional lights in each of these 
: areas, as well as discuss with 
the City of Pittsburgh th feasi
bility of lighting the Schenley 
Park side of Frew Street, an 
area that is dark and overhung 
with trees.
And while it might cost a sig
nificant amount, the University 
should consider supporting 
Shuttle/Escort in order to ex
pand and improve the route, 
hours, or even equipment. Cur
rently, Housing funds the ser
vice, and cant be asked for more, 
because it usually runs under a 
tight budget. By supplying the 
needed additional funds, the 
University would be acknowl
edging its responsibility con
cerning the safety of students 
who live off campus.
We would also like to encour
age Student Government Presi
dent Natalie Gesmonds work 
starting a student escort ser
vice. Providing on-campus walk
ing escorts for students is an 
excellent idea, and we would 
like to see it get started as soon 
as possible  and suggest that 
students consider volunteering 
their time to the effort. And once 
the program is instituted, stu
dents should remember to take 
advantage of it.
Until these improvements are 
made, there are things students 
can do to be safer. Use the cur
rent Shuttle and Escort services 
whenever possible, even if it 
involves waiting for a little 
while. Desk attendants in dorms 
should always check IDs, and 
students should cooperate with 
the effort to maintain safe Uni
versity residences. Also, always 
walk where the lights are, even 
if it takes longer. This sugges
tion involves Physical Plant 
making sure that the lighting 
already in place is in good re
pair and is always on, which is 
not currently the case. Always 
try to walk with someone, and 
be aware of what is going on 
around you.
By looking out for each other 
and taking a little extra time to 
be safe, we might be able to 
avoid terrible incidents like last 
weekends rape of a student in 
Schenley Park.
Its better to be too careful 
than to become the victim of a 
crime.
Groups remain innocent 
until proven guilty
Student Senates primary pur
pose, according to the student 
body bylaws, is to safeguard and 
promote the welfare of the stu
dents, through legislation and 
by supervising and coordinat
ing the execution and financing 
of extracurricular activities. 
Once again, Senates idea of how 
to safeguard students welfare 
differs from ours.
Last Tuesday, Senate passed 
an amendment to the student 
body bylaws. The amendment 
says the Funding and Recogni
tion Committee (F&R) has the 
power to impound any equip
ment a student organization has 
purchased with Activities Fee 
money if the organization vio
lates the fiscal policy outlined 
in the bylaws. F&R can impound 
the equipment pending an in'vestigation. That means an 
organizations equipment can be 
taken away on suspicion of a 
violation of fiscal policy, before 
an investigation even takes 
place. Its bad enough that F&R 
has had the power to freeze bud
gets without proof of wrongdo
ing. In a country where were 
used to being innocent until 
proven guilty, its disturbing 
that our governing body feels it 
can impose punishment before 
proof of guilt.
On the surface, this new 
amendment is troubling. Con
sidering Senates track record, 
however, this new development 
is downright frightening. Just

Sadly, another vio
lent crime has occurred 
on the CMU campus, 
on Frew Street, be
hind Baker, as re
ported on the front page of The Tartan 
[Student assaulted, 1/25]. You quote 
the Chief of Campus Police, We [Cam
pus Police] would urge people not to 
walk alone at night. Safety in numbers 
must not apply here, as a group of three 
was attacked last summer, on Frew 
Street, behind Baker.
I hope that mere advice is not all that 
the Campus Police will offer. Somehow, 
not even one minute away from police 
headquarters, is a highly dangerous area. 
The lighting is at a minimum on the 
street, andnon-existentjust50feetaway
behind the curtain of trees separating 
CMU and Schenley. Those that would 
harm us must revel in the knowledge 
that crimes can be committed without 
the victims being able to see them be
fore, during, or after the attacks. Con
sidering that the academic buildings lie 
adjacent to this area, as well as much of 
the parking, I am aghast that Carnegie 
Mellon would allow the Frew Street area 
to be so dangerous. Certainly the powers 
that be realize that many of us do work 
late nights in the halls of these build
ings. Should we expect violent crime to 
spill over into the rooms where we work 
as well?
Campus Police must not bear all the 
blame. They are under the whim of the 
Carnegie Mellon bureaucracy, which, 
supposedly, reflects the attitude of the 
CMU population. Last fall, while the 
Student Senate collected input (which 
was later printed in The Tartan), I submitted my opinion that there should be 
more lighting on campus. I was shocked 
to find that many people found this sug
gestion amusing. As a victim, I see the 
campus differently, perhaps differently 
than those who have not been assaulted 
on campus. I would like to feel secure, 
here, where I live and work. Apparently, 
the general concensus is apathy, or 
maybe ignorance. Obviously, the pains 
of a few will not pay for new lighting or 
extra patrols.
How much must we endure before 
things change? Will a murder convince 
us that something must be done? Hear
ing people say Just dont walk there at 
night, reflects an indifference to the 
danger lurking on our campus. Are they 
indifferent to leaving their homes un
locked at night as well?
Greg Chung 
Sophomore, SCS
Republicans become more moderate
Christian M. Restifo
then chair of F&R, froze a line of 
The Thistles budget because a 
reliable source told him there 
was a problem with the organic 
zation. Without getting corrobo
ration from another source or 
investigating further, Loomis 
took punitive action. He later 
reversed his decision. Later in 
the semester, he froze the Cy
cling Clubs budget after receiv
ing a complaint from a member 
of the club who also happened to 
be a Senator. Again, the action 
was taken before an investiga
tion and without any evidence 
of wrongdoing beyond the word 
of one person. That decision, 
too, was later reversed.
We hope Dave Martin, the 
current chair of F&R, will be 
more careful with his power, 
but the fact remains that he, or 
his successors, can more or less 
arbitrarily freeze any student 
organ-izations funds, and now 
can also impound equipment.
Another problem with this 
amendment is that it is impos
sible to tell whether Activities 
Fee funds were used to pur
chase equipment for groups with 
income besides the Activities 
Fee money. All the income is 
listed together  theres no no
tation to indicate which income 
pays for which budget items.
Senators occasionally point 
out that theyre students too, so 
they know how students feel. So 
why do they pass legislation that 
is more likely to hurt students 
than to help them?
Last week, the Republican National Committee (RNC) 
elected Rich Bond as chairman. Bond, who served as an 
adviser to Lee Atwater when he was the RNC chairman, is 
considered a moderate who can pull the party back together 
and mount a grass-roots campaign to restore its power. Let us 
hope that he can do this without giving in to right wing spe
cial interests. Let us also hope, also, that he and the party 
wake up, smell the coffee, and stop pushing certain issues.
Bond, who won 90 out of 165 possible votes, said that the 
party should adopt a more moderate position on abortion. 
Such a stance would no doubt help the party. While anti
abortionists are quick to point out that surveys show that 
Americans have problems with abortion on demand, they fail 
to mention that Americans also oppose outright bans. The 
only problem is that Bond also feels that Republicans should 
view abortion as an issue to be resolved by individual states. 
Such a stance helps create a patchwork of abortion laws and 
freedoms  something right wing anti-abortionists favor. 
After all, if you cant stop 'em all, lets screw over whomever 
we can get our hands on.
Bond also said that Republicans should push peace, pros
perity, and national defense  those things that won the
party three out of the last four Presidential elections. Al
though such a stance does move away from the failed religious 
and right wing agenda of the past, certain parts will not work. 
For example, national defense is an important issue, but at 
this point in time, and for a while to come, Americans are, and 
will be, more concerned about domestic issues. Defense issues 
may get you the votes of people working for General Electric 
Boat Division, Lockheed, or the Pentagon, but thats not 
everyone.
And peace is something hard to promise in todays world.. 
anyone knows, the price for a strong peace is a strong defense. 
But there no longer is a threat from the Soviet Union. The 
military must handle ofvariety of new jobs while scaling down 
... and the U.N. will have to play a larger role. Pushing 
maintaining the peace of the world is Cold War thinking.
But one should not think that the Republican party has only 
a small shot at regaining prestige. Senator Arlen Specter of 
Pennsylvania and other moderate Republican senators re
cently made a call for moderates to concern themselves with 
things that concern the American people. The challenge 
ahead will be to regain the trust of the average voter.
Right now, most right wing Republicans who are reading 
this are probably turning blood red. Theyre screaming about 
Slick Willie and the whole trust issue in the campaign. 
Only 43 percent of voters picked Slick Willie, they gasp. 
That means that the rest voted against him. We lost because 
of George Bush. The reply to this is so simple that a child 
could understand it: No, the Party lost.

On Sunday, January 24, a female stu
dent was raped on Frew Street. Posters 
appeared on campus titled Sexual As
sault, and in both MorewoodandMudge, 
somebody has crossed off Sexual As
sault and written in Rape  a good 
start.
Its easy to play the issue down as a 
simple, sexual assault, but it was any
thing but that. Anybody who has been 
on any part of Frew Street at night 
knows that the lighting is practically 
non-existent, and anyone who has been 
over there in the last month or so knows 
that it is cold, too  cold and windy. At 
1:40 am, in the pitch dark, freezing cold, 
and wind, a student was brutally raped 
by two men, while another one stood as 
a look-out. Sexual assault doesnt quite 
do it justice.
This play-it-down attitude is going 
to present a problem with how the cam
pus community receives the news. The 
response that the rape has received from 
the University (increased nightly pa
trols and the dont walk alone at night 
advice), has the issue quickly on its way 
to being forgotten, by men and women 
alike, because there hasnt been a much 
of a reason from the University to be 
worried.
You can imagine what the Campus
Polices line on all of this probably is: 
Well, we dont want everyone to panic. 
Why the hell not? If the police depart
ment doesnt act worried, why should 
the,students? Why dont they act very 
worried and scare the hell out of every
one? Wouldnt that get the point across 
a lot better? Maybe people would re
member this longer, and maybe things 
will get done (like lighting Frew Street, 
for instance).
So before everyone forgets the rape, or 
writes it off as an isolated incident, take 
a group J'teld trip over to Frew Street 
around midnight and sit there for a fe"' 
minutes, listening and imagining what 
the woman went through. Then imagine 
how you would feel if one of your friends 
or family members had been raped. And 
think about how it feels just to think 
about it.
Maybe if we all remember it, we can all 
work together to make sure that nothin? 
like this ever happens again.

circle creates unhappyVicious
Brian D. Smith
Well, CMU now has its own 
mudwrestling facility next to the 
soon-to-be demolished Skibo Hall. 
Now that we can see that there is 
an actual possibility of some form 
of a University Center being built, 
it seems like a good time to look 
at what our years of waiting for 
this reveal about CMU. Specifi
cally, lets look at the central prob
lem that has almost halted this 
project: money.
It seems to me this university 
has a lot of trouble raising money 
for non-research projects. Why is 
that, some may ask? Well, to an
swer that question, ask yourself, 
After graduation, years from 
now, do you think you would con
tribute financially to Carnegie 
Mellon University? In discus
sions with others, the following 
responses have been given:
Hell, NO!
Yeah, right.
I wouldnt give a dime to 
Carnegie Mellon University if I 
won the Lotto every day for a
year, I won both the Publishers 
Clearing House and the Ameri
can Family Sweepstakes, and I 
was adopted by Ross Perot and 
made his sole heir!
In short, it seems as though 
most people dont really plan on 
giving money to the University. 
Obviously, this is a problem that 
has plagued the University for a 
long time, evidenced by the fact 
that this whole University Cen
ter seems to rest on the mood 
swings of a possible multi-mil
lion dollar donor.
The next logical question is, 
why dont people want to contrib
ute to Carnegie Mellon after 
graduation? To anyone who has 
ever spent more than two weeks 
here, the question is trite. It 
seems most of us have made a 
pastime of bitching about CMU. 
The primary reason people do not 
plan on contributing to Carnegie 
Mellon later is that we are con
tributing blood, sweat, and tears 
now. My best guess is that stu
dents at other universities are 
happier. They probably have less 
stress, go to bed at normal hours, 
and dont have to experience 
Pittsburghs annual battle with 
Mother Nature over whether its 
supposed to snow or rain in the 
winter. I have heard of students
at other colleges staying an extra 
semester just to experience an
other drunken football season. 
If you asked a Carnegie Mellon 
student about staying an extra 
semester, his or her reply would 
be Youd have to pay me to stay 
here a minute longer than neces
sary." Hence, the Fifth Year 
Scholars Program.
But my point is not that the 
workload should be reduced, be
cause it has been my understanding that most people take pride in 
working hard, and they also know 
employers seem to favor diligent 
students over those college gradu
ates who have spent the last four 
years fulfilling graduation re
quirements with blow-off courses 
such as Slang English 101, 
Computations of Tips at Res
taurants, and Communications 
with Late Night Seven Eleven
Employees.
But that cant be the only rea
son people arent going to con
tribute. After all, there are plenty 
of other universities that are 
bankrupting the middle class. 
How do their situations compare 
to CMUs? After all, most of us 
are going to spend the next 30 
years paying off student loans, 
and trying to pay for the remodel
ing of the cardboard box our par
ents now live in because of all the
money they spent payingfor this 
place.
This brings us back to the topic 
ofthe University Center, since it 
promises a first rate facility to 
make the most of whatever free 
time students have left. But we 
are in a vicious cycle. There is no 
money from alumni, therefore 
no University Center. No Uni
versity Center, more miserable
alumni
students, more future ungiving 
alumni. So it seems that Warner 
Halls plan to break the cycle is to 
cheapen the cost of the Univer
sity Center. I imagine by now 
their plans are for a building with 
a pool the size of a deluxe bath
tub, one large meeting room 
rented on a time-share program 
by student organizations, and a 
take-out only Tartan Grill. But 
hey, what really nice tennis courts 
well have! We have to endure 
years of construction equipment 
parked on our campus for that!
The basic problem still exists: 
scarce alumni contributions. 
Even if the University Center 
turns out to be little more than 
Skibo II: The Return of Architec
tural Bloopers and Practical 
Jokes, it should be noted that the 
current efforts by Wamerville, 
such as the Commission on Un
dergraduate Education, are a step 
in the right direction. Unfortu
nately, without substantial im
provements in the quality of stu
dent life, the evolution from dis
gruntled student to cheap alumni 
will continue.
Brian D. Smith is a sophomore 
IM major who hopes to be a 
multi-million-dollar donor 
someday.

Republican Party aims for more moderate stance
REPUBLICANS, from page 6
even larger percentage voted against Bush. 
Whats the difference? The point is, Bush 
lost because he and the party gave into 
demands by right wing groups. Adopting a 
moderate position will be the only option 
that can ensure enough political muscle to 
pose a threat to Clinton and the Demo
crats in 1996.
What the Republicans must realize is 
that technically, they already stand for 
things that most people like. For ex
ample, few people would argue that we 
should have more government and more 
taxes. Few people would argue that gov
ernment should interfere in the personal 
lives of citizens. We often hear staunch 
right wing Republicans espouse these 
small government/few taxes philosophies 
while accusing the liberal, ACLU cardcarrying, tax-and-spend Democrats of 
being against things like personal liber
ties. Only a fool would fail to notice the 
blatant contradiction.
So, what are they to do? As already 
pointed out, Bond wants to adopt a more 
moderate stance. He could also urge strong 
fiscal responsibility. The deficit and the 
size of government grew during the past 
12 years of two Republican administraThey could also reverse the erosion of 
civil liberties. After all, a major result of 
the drug war, which is run . by officials 
appointed by Republican administrations, 
is the fact that you can have your proper

lies out with effective family issues laws. 
Since theyve also been clamoring for wel
fare reform, they can put pressure on 
Clinton to hold to his belief of revamping 
the system. The new Secretary of Health
and Human Services knows very little 
about welfare reform, and the average 
citizen feels it no longer oxists for its 
original purpose of helping people 
through hard times. If this isnt a chance 
to criticize the Democrats and win popu
lar support, I dont know what is.
Please keep in mind that I am in no way 
saying that those with strong religious 
views or moral beliefs should be purged 
from the rank and file. To do so would be 
to alienate a large portion of the country, 
both fundamental and moderate. They 
should be made aware, however, that the 
type of conservatism that America needs 
is fiscal and governmental conservatism, 
not the conceited moral kind. Pushing 
certain agendas under the guise of found
ing beliefs is about as bad as the Demo
cratic concept of Affirmative Action.

The 
Housing Office 
is now accepting applications 
from groups of students who would like to be 
considered for residency in one of the 7 Special Interest Houses.
The four Special Interest Houses in the Margaret Morrison Complex are 4-bedroom, 
8-person apartments. The three Special Interest Suites in Resnik House are two 8- 
person houses with 3 double rooms and 2 single rooms; and one 7-person house 
with 3 single rooms and 2 double rooms. While all 8-person houses include 2 
bathrooms, the 7-person suite has just one bathroom and must be occupied by 
members of the same gender. The Margaret Morrison houses include a kitchen and 
living room. The Resnik Hall suites do not include a kitchen. In order to be eligible 
for consideration for a Special Interest House, a student group must have at least 
eight members (seven in the case of the house in Resnik), and two alternates.
The specific goal of the Housing Office in providing the Special Interest Houses is to 
encourage situations where the living environment complements the learning 
opportunities of the residents involved, where specific educational goals outlined by 
the member-residents are understood and enhanced and where outreach programs 
are provided by the group to the residence hall community.
If more than 7 groups of students submit applications for these Special Interest 
Houses, a decision will be based on a comparison of the educational goals presented 
and the likelihood of serious educational benefit being derived from residency in 
this type of living situation as well as the anticipated impact the group will have on 
the residence hall community.
Application forms are available in the Housing Office and must be filled out and 
returned by:

SPORTS
PRESS PASS
by Paul Platosh
Football 
Fans: know 
when to shut
up
I was sitting in the Suffering 
Artists and Writers section of 
the Tartan Grill the other day, 
tiying to cultivate that writers 
image as best as I could. Yeah, I 
had the cigarette dangling from 
my lips, the look of perpetual 
thought expressed by my fur
rowed brow. With me sat a poet 
who spoke in short gasps, and an 
art major who sat and cried. We 
were having a grand old time, 
taking about suffering, injustice, 
and groovy things like that.
Then I must have had a 
massive stroke. I say stroke 
because what else could have 
prompted me to say the follow
ing words, So what do you 
guys think about the 
SuperBowl? A pox on my 
foolish tongue! Through the 
hazy smoke, I saw the poet look 
at me with an expression of 
disbelief. What a faux pa! I had 
talked sports in the Suffering 
Artists and Writers section; 
how blase!.
Thinking quickly, I knew that 
I had to cover my tracks in 
order to regain my rightful 
position as Head Suffering 
Writer, who, would never 
discuss any sport (except maybe 
chess), let alone something as 
barbaric as the game of football. 
My mind went into overdrive, 
and tried to save the day with a 
last ditch effort, a Hail Mary, I 
mean, what a high example of 
mass scale media manipulation 
all fried upon the skillet of male 
aggressiveness, I said and 
later added the catch-all phrase 
Im so alone, as a sort of 
wearied afterthought.
Right on, said the poet, and 
the artist just cried. It seems 
like I had been vindicated, after 
all. I sat back in my chair and 
began to wonder. Yes, there are 
certain times when discussing 
the SuperBowl is the right 
thing to do, and other times 
when its wrong. I buried my 
cigarette butt in the ash tray, 
adding another stump to the 
filter forest vigorously sprout
ing in the center of our table.
Football is a sport that has its 
own cult following. There is 
certain form and definitive 
characteristics that accompany 
the football fan. Those who 
dont have those characteristics 
are simply not fans of the game, 
and discussing football with 
them can lead to tragic results. 
But even the fans themselves 
are as different and varied as 
the teams they follow. Good 
football fans can always spot a 
Browns fan, or a Dolphins fan, 
and as Sun Tzu says, it pays to 
know the enemy.
So I got out of my seat, bid 
my adieu to the Sufferers, and 
walked over to Athletes and 
Jocks Section of the Tartan 
Grill (in the non-smoking 
section, of course). Lively 
discussions were already in 
progress about the upcoming 
event, and I was sure that, 
here, my own discussions and 
ramblings would go undetected.
I guess theres a moral to this 
story. When it comes to the 
SuperBowl, look before you 
leap.

Fruehan breaks two more records in 
swim team loss to Slippery Rock U.
By ERIC STRAUSS
Tartan Assistant Sports Editor
Although Carnegie Mellons swim team was 
swept by Division II Slippery Rock University, 
freshman Becky Fruehan once again sparkled for 
the Tartans, breaking two CMU school and pool 
records. Fruehan broke the 50-yard and 100-yard 
freestyle records set by CMU alum andformer AllAmerican Francesca Crannell in 1990.
Fruehan won the 50-yard freestyle in 24.97 
seconds and the 100-yard freestyle in 54.41 sec
onds to set her third and fourth records of her first 
college season. Despite her heroics, the women 
were soundly defeated, 135-65.
Three other women, sophomore Diane Keen 
(200-yard individual medley), senior Maiyam 
Tangoren (200-yard breaststroke) and freshman 
Suzanne Garrett (500-yard freestyle), set per
sonal best times, even though none finishedhigher 
than third.

20, coach Jim Cutrone said. Theyre just a stronger team 
than we are.
Meanwhile, the men lost a heartbreaker, 104-100. Going 
into the final race, the 400-yard freestyle relay, the three 
relay teams needed second, third and fourth place to tie the 
score, but two teams were disqualified for false starts.
The meet went back and forth the whole time, Cutrone 
said. We didnt put in the best lineup for the meet, because 
I wanted to see people swim different events for the UAA 
meet. You sacrifice a dual meet for UAA championships. 
Still, both teams swam where they should be going into the 
meet.
The men had a pair of double winners, freshmen Matt Moe 
and Chris Graefe. Moe won the 200-yard freestyle and 200- 
yard breaststroke, while Graefe won the 500-yard and 
1,000-yard freestyles.
With the UAA championship meet less than two weeks 
away, Cutrone is changing the teams practice style.
What we do is bring the yardage down, but we have more 
quality. We fine tune our starts and turns. Most impor
tantly, we rest.
At the meet, held February 11-13 at Washington Univerj 
sity in St. Louis, Cutrono said he hopes the men will finish | 
second as a team and place five individual and two relay J 
teams in the national meet. Meanwhile, ho said the women; 
are hoping to improve in any way over last yoars seventhj 
place finish.
As for national qualifiers, he said lots just say Im hoping! 
for all-around individual improvement. Id rathor not dia-! 
cuss any particular individuals."
To advance to the national championships, held March 
11-13 (women) and 18-20 (men) at Emory University in 
Atlanta, swimmers must moot a qualifying standard time. 
As a result, place does not matter at the UAA meet.
A swimmer could finish third, but still advance to nationi 
als if he or she makes the qualifying timo, but could win a! 
race but not advance if the timo is too slow.
The Tartan men end the dual meet season with a record of!

Men's hoops score double winTartans defeat Rochester, Brandis
By JOSH LINDER
Tartan Staffwriter
The mens team, seeking re
venge over last years four de
feats against Rochester and 
Brandis, swept their two week
end matches, winning by 12 and 
10, respectively.
The Friday game was a bit 
different than the womens 
match, with CMU dominating 
the whole game.
Apparently the four game 
slide the team was in is over, 
and the team from the early 
part of the season is back.
Although neither team was 
an offensive monster (only 55 
total first half points), CMU 
came across as the dominant 
club, leading by as many as nine 
in the first half.
Junior Charlie Conners, 
CMUs big man had 14 points 
and three rebounds in the first 
half to lead the team, with co
captain Todd Jenkins six points 
and three rebounds.
The entire team played well, 
resulting ;n a 63.6 percent field 
goal percentage.
In the second half, however, 
Rochesters more aggresive style 
of play, coupled with CMUs sec
ond string players, allowed the 
Jackets to pick up nine 
unanswewed points and keep 
the game close.
Carnegie Mellons defense 
then kicked in, with CMU stop
ping any further attempt to close 
the 12 point gap.
Jenkins kicked in nine points 
of his own in the second period, 
as Conners collected five more 
rebounds.
Junior guard Mike Hosni fin
ished with 10 points, and junior 
guard Rony Johns had seven.
"This was probably the big
gest game of the year for us, 
was the unanimous opinion of 
the team.
After losing 8847 last year, 
this was just great, stated many 
of the players.
The CMU squad, which was 
only 614 last year, seemed to 
be no match for the NCAA Divi
sion III champions of two years 
ago.
However, after losing their big 
man, legendary seven foot cen
ter Chris Fite, Rochester hasnt 
been the same.
In the Sunday game, another 
UAA matchup, CMU faced the 
Brandeis University Judges with 
hopes of bringing their confer
ence record closer to .500.
The early going of the game 
was dominated by CMU, with 
the Tartans hitting a number of 
shots, and grabbing rebounds 
when Brandeis was appearing 
to come back. Carnegie Mellon 
still hit the needed field goals.
Jenkins, appearing to be 
pumped up by the obnoxious 
home crowd, made some out
standing passes and some very 
good shots from the key, finish
ing with four points, seven as
sists and seven rebounds.
Rony Johns and Kenny Pugh, 
both guarded very heavily by 
the opposition, responded with 
accurate passing and a good de
fensive effort on the other side of 
the court.
Connors, the catalyst of the 
Tartans, snagged 12 boards for 
the CMU while getting 11 points 
of his own. Co-captain Chris 
Benec, had five points in 13 min
utes of play.
The Brandeis squad, plagued 
by possible overconfidence, had 
a problem with hitting key shots.
Also, it seemed as though they 
didnt have an inside game, lack
ing the ability to spin and shoot 
accurately when needed.
The play of Dragasich, who 
was the real star in the game 
with 15 points in the first half 
and 28 overall, carried the team
offensively, while Conners had 
five boards.
Im real pleased with how 
our guys played, Wingen said 
after the first half. They just 
didnt have any big guys, with 
the exception of sophomore for
ward Duke Jewell.
Wingen failed to mention, 
however, that Brandeis recently 
lost their 68 center Hugh Lacy 
to surgery. The second half al
lowed CMU to extend its lead, 
which it did with the help of 
Dragasich.
He continued his first half 
play, with the addition of some 
key acting to draw fouls.
Fouls were a major problem 
for both teams in the second 
half, with Brandeis and CMU 
each collecting 10 team fouls.
The heckles from the crowd 
didnt stop in the second half, 
but neither did the CMU of
fense.
With both teams collecting 
10 fouls, part of the game was 
spent going back and forth be
tween free throw attempts.
Freshman forward Kevin 
Byrne ended with 12 points, 
Johns who finished with 13, and 
Hosni who had nine, all added 
to the 8676 CMU victory.
The battle was won by the 
excellent play of CMU squad, 
which is now 125 overall and 
45 in the UAA.
They will take on Washing
ton University on Friday at 
home at 8:00 pm andHaverford 
away on Sunday.

Indoor track team 
runs smoothly
By ERIC STRAUSS
Tartan Assistant Sports Editor
Sophomore Jason Grusky set a 
new CMU indoor track record in 
the shot put with a winning throw 
of 46 feet 8.5 inches at the Robert 
Morris Invite on Saturday.
I set the school record last 
year. This year's throw beat that 
distance by about a foot. My goal 
is to beat my personal best which 
is 46 feet 10.5 inches," said 
Grusky.
The non-scored meet also fea
tured several outstanding per
formances by members of the 
mens indoor track team.
Senior Sean McDowell won the 
800-meter run, while junior 
Jarrod Siket won the 400-meter 
run. They were also members of 
the second place relay 1600-meter 
relay team. The other members 
of that team were juniors Jeff 
Gregor and Garrett Long.
Long was also third in the 55- 
meter high hurdles.
Freshman Mike Rea won the 
1,500-meter run, the only other 
individual win for the Tartans.
Other place-winners included 
senior Scott Phillips, who finished 
second in the 3,000-meters, two 
spots ahead of freshman Matt 
Beam. Sophomore Jim Filicko fin
ished second in two events: the 
55-meter dash and the 200-meter 
dash.
Freshman Zach Conly finished 
three places behind Filicko in the 
55-meter dash.
After the meet, coach Gary 
Meckley was optimistic abou the 
teams performance, and about 
the results two meets into the 
season.
For Dario Donatellis womens 
team, three athletes placed, with 
freshman Melissa Baustert win
ning the 800-meter run and se
nior Wendy Evans winning the 
3,000-meter run. Junior Ersula 
Cosby was the only other place 
winner, with a second-place fin
ish in the triple jump.
Women's basketball drops 
two games over weekend
By JOSH LINDER
Tartan Staffwriter
This weekend, the womens 
basketball team dropped two key 
University Athletic Association 
matches to the University of 
Rochester and Brandeis Univer
sity.
On Friday, the Carnegie 
Mellon womens team met Roch
ester, their always difficult UAA 
opponent. Early in the game, both 
teams seemed evenly matched, 
both offensively and defensively.
Junior guard Jeanine 
Megahan, although she finished 
with 15 points, didnt seem to be 
the offensive threat she had been 
in the past.
SophomoreMeredith McKnight, who was benched after 
being ineffective on the rebound, 
faced similar problems, although 
she ended the game with 13 
points and four rebounds.
As the first period came to an 
close, the Yellowjackets had a 
substantial 33-26 lead. The CMU 
team of last year has not re
turned, as the team has not been 
as domineering aB it has in the 
past.
The second half, however, 
proved to be a game of catch-up 
for the Tartans, in which they 
gained any ground they had lost 
in the first half.
Towards the middle of the sec
ond half, CMU staged a tremen

Megahan wins all-UAA player of week 
honors for third time this season
By GARY WILSON
Tartan Staffwriter
After losing their fourth straight game to 
the University of Chicago laBt Sunday after
noon, Carnegie Mellons mens basketball 
team squashed Washington and Jeffersons 
high powered offense in a 60-47 victory this 
past Wednesday.
Against Chicago on Sunday, Carnegie 
Mellon got the better of the play early on. 
Junior Charlie Connors opened the contest 
at 19:16 with an easy basket from under
neath the hoop. The Tartans controlled the 
lead for the first five minutes of play. Chi
cago took a small lead with a three-pointer 
at 13:28 before Tartan senior Todd Jenkins 
countered with a three of his own.
The lead went back and forth throughout 
the reBt of the half. With 1:33 left in the 
period, junior Derek Dragisich converted a 
layup as he was fouled to take a 24-23 lead. 
A few seconds later, Chicago coach Pat 
Cunningham was handed a technical foul 
for losing his temper. Jenkins took advan
tage of the situation and sunk two free 
throws to end the half at 26-23.
Chicago came out and dominated the first 
few minutes ofthe Becond half. They battled 
back to take a 36-32 advantage. At 15:24, 
Jenkins started a Tartan rally by dishing off 
a great no-look pass to Dragisich, who quickly 
layed it in. The Tartans dominated control 
of the ball for the next three minutes. Over 
the next seven minutes, they outscored Chi
cago 13-6.
The CMU domination ended with fresh
man Kenny Pughs coast-to-coast drive to 
thehoop, at the 8:28 mark. Afterthat.itwas 
mostly Chicago. The Maroons of Chicago 
came back to take a four point lead with two 
minutes remaining in the game. Carnegie 
Mellon did manage to tie it up after a free 
throw by Connors and another three-pointer 
by Jenkins; however, the rest of the scoring 
went to Chicago. The final score saw Chi
cago ahead, 59-53.
Connors lead the team in scoring and 
rebounding with 15 points and 12 boards. 
Dragisich knocked down 14 points, putting 
him over the 800 career point mark. Jenkins 
finished with 11 points and six assists.
The Tartans then prepared to face Wash
ington and Jefferson and their two high 
scorers, Terry Wilkins (20.1 points per game) 
and Mark Johnson (20.6 points per game). 
In an earlier meeting between the two teams 
this season, Wilkins and Johnson scored a 
combined 48 points. However, this time 
around the Tartans held their whole team to 
under 48 points.
Carnegie Mellon started the game with a 
new look. Freshmen Pugh and Kevin Byrne 
got their first starts of the season. I felt like 
we needed to make a change to give us a 
spark. The lineup that I felt gave us the 
most significantly different look was the one 
I went with, said coach Tony Wingen. Ap
parently, the change did give the team the 
spark they needed. Byrne hit some nice 
three-pointers. Pugh did a pretty good job of 
running the offense. Theyre both going to 
get better and better. [Juniors] Rony Johns 
and Mike Hosni gave us some really good 
play off the bench. For now, well stick with 
it and see what happens after that, said 
Wingen.
Byrne knocked down the first three points
for Carnegie Mellon at the 17:53 mark. W&J 
forward Kenyon Bonnor came back with three 
layups, only to be countered by three baskets 
from Dragisich.
At 12:43, Johns hit a big three-pointer to 
give the Tartans their second lead of the 
game. One minute later, Matt Johnson (twin 
brother of Mark Johnson), took Dragisich out 
of the game, knocking him down hard on a 
drive to the hoop.
Junior Matt Reiprish came in to replace 
him and sunk his first shot shortly after. 
W&J scored the next four points and re
gained control.
At 8:15, Jenkins canned a three-pointer to
scoring six points, including a slam dunk. 
The remainder of the second half featured 
incredible defense on the part of CMU and 
consistent scoring as well.
Reiprish and Connors combined for eight 
of the teams last ten hoops, as the game 
ended with Carnegie Mellon ahead 60-47.
The Tartans managed to hold Wilkins to 
eight points and Mark Johnson to 15.
It was a tremendous defensive effort, 
Wingen said. They are a very explosive team, 
averaging 70 points a game. We got a lot of 
good help from the guards on defense. Offen
sively it wasnt a stellar performance. The 
big thingis, we took care of them defensively. 
Dragisich started on Wilkins and did an 
outstanding job. The guards really helped 
out doubling on him and forced him into some 
bad shots. It was a nice team effort. 
Jenkins led the Tartans with 11 points on 
the night. Johns and Reiprish hit 10 points 
each. Connorsledwithl4rebounds. Thewin 
snapped a four-game losing streak and ex
tended the teams record to 10-5.

After sacrificing a late-game lead to Washington University, and 
losing in overtime on January 22, the Carnegie Mellon womens 
basketball team turned the tables two days later against the 
University of Chicago.
The team battled back in the last few minutes to force a doubleovertime victory and set themselves back on the winning track.
The team got off to a slow start against the Chicago Maroons. 
After sophomore Meridith McKnight's opening basket at 19:30, the 
Tartans missed five straight shots and allowed Chicago to take the 
early advantage.
Only five minutes into the game, Maroons leading scorer, senior 
Catherine Fitzgerald, was injured as she fouled CMU senior Kelly 
Sterling. Fitzgerald was averaging nearly 12 points a game, but 
was held scoreless, LL she left for the night.
Aftor hitting four straight baskets, Chicago built up their largeBt 
lend of the game, 17-10, at 11:50. The game went in waves for the 
noxt five minutes. The Tartans hit three straight, Chicago hit three 
straight, then CMU returned the favor with four baskets of their 
own. The half ended with Chicago leading, 31-28. The first 15 
minutes of the second half couldnt have been played more evenly. 
Chicago never asLa the lead during this time, but never got more 
than n three-point load. During this time, Sterling tied up the score 
on four separate occasions. The Tartans seemed to be really hurting 
in the rebounding department but made up for it by making 
Excellent plays to steal and retain possession of the ball.
! With 5:15 remaining on the clock, Maroons senior Kathleen 
AbWt converted a lay up to take a four point lead. At 3:24, she did 
it again to make it a 56-50 lead. Play went both ways, with neither 
team scoring until the one-minute mark. At this time, junior 
Jeanine Megahan stole the ball and walked in alone to cut the lead 
to four points.
; The clock ticked down to 15 seconds when Chicago lost posses
sion of the ball on a traveling violation. It took only five seconds for 
Sterling to draw a foul and can both free throws. The foul was 
Chicagos Kim Dennis fifth of the game.
> With ten seconds remaining, the Maroons inbounded the ball, 
only to see it picked off by sophomore Christa Sober. Sober swung 
pe ball to junior Chandra Buist who hit the tying shot with five 
seconds remaining, sending the game into overtime.
I In overtime, the Tartans found themselves down once again, with 
|ess than a minute to go.
[ However, with 49 seconds left, Sterling stole the ball, scored, and 
prew the foul completing the big three-point play. It was Carnegie
ellons first lead since 6:48 of the first half. Chicago quickly tied 
it up and forced a second overtime period.
I The final five minute period belonged to Megahan. She scored 
three times and added an assist to win the game 72-68. She 
amazingly played all 50 min
utes of the game.

Its Saturday night after an early af
ternoon Penguins game. The ice surface 
is being wiped smooth by the lumbering 
Zamboni. The aisles are being cleared of 
scattered beer cups, popcorn, and as
sorted debris. The dimly lit parking lot 
is desolate, a desert of asphalt and 
paintedlines. Then out comes two bands 
of die-hard, meagerly paid lacrosse play
ers who choose to play the game they 
love on a playing field that consists of 
square patches of artificial turf thrown 
upon the ice rink. Yes, Im talking about 
that Rodney Dangerfield of arena sports 
(the one with no 
respect), major 
indoor lacrosse.
Saturday 
night, the 0-2 
Pittsburgh 
Bulls faced off 
against the 0-2 
Detroit Turbos.
Both came into 
the game tied for 
second in the 
mediocre Na
tional division, 
and the winner 
would capture 
its first win of 
the eight game 
season. A hard
core crowd of 
6,274 lacrosse 
fans, meager in 
comparison to 
thel6,024 hock
ey fans that 
watched the 
Penguins game 
only five hours before, came out to cheer 
the winless Bulls and their lovely cheer
leaders. The Bulls struck first after the 
face-off at 1:48 of the first period on a 
give-and-go goal scored by young Jeff 
WillB, who starred at Johns Hopkins. 
Detroit, though, answered quickly, scor
ing two consecutive goals, the last being 
a shorthanded goal with a Detroit player 
sitting in the penalty box. Not to be 
outdone in front of their home crowd, 
the Bulls stormed back, answering with 
two goals in 50 seconds.
Play continued in this see-saw mancomplexion of the game was finally 
determined in the fourth quarter. The 
Bulls and Detroit were tied at 15 apiece 
when at 5:39 of the fourth, Detroit for
ward Ted Dowling scored his second 
goal of the afternoon to make it 16-15 
in Detroits favor. One of the Turbos 
scored an unassisted goal with a 
Herculean individual effort around two 
defenders to make it 17-15. Shirleys 
goal at 5:39 broke the spirit of the 
young Bulls, and the Turbos proceeded 
to score twice more on Bulls goaltender 
Kevin Bilger. The final goal of the after
noon by the Bulls made the score 18  
16. Fittingly, it was scored by Wills, 
who started out the evening with the 
first tally. De
troit Forward 
Duane Jacobs 
was chosen as 
the Coors Light 
Player of the 
Game for his five 
goals. Pat Lamon 
led the way for 
the Bulls with 
two goals and 
four assists.
Surely the 
Bulls must be 
reeling after this 
closely contested 
loss, considering 
the fact that it is 
coming off the 
heels of another 
close loss, an 
overtime loss to 
the New York 
Saints several 
weeks ago. Head 
coach Dennis 
Wey probably 
has his young team doing some soul 
searching, asking themselves what it 
takes to win. Granted, the team was 
without the services of star forward 
Dave Pietramala, who was trying out 
for the American World Cup team, and 
a pair of injured players, forward Ron 
Klausner and Btar goaltender Craig

Scouting Director in 1985.
Many major league players, like

He helped bring success to the Pi

in 1990,1991, and 1992.
Since 1989, Gray has worked for the
Bucs part-time on special assignments.
On the current state of the Pirates, 
including their inability to keop many ofi 
the players that Gray had a role in 
signing, and thoir outlook for tho sea, 
son, Gray was optimistic.
Thats the nature of the game. You 1 
hate to lose any of tho players who are I 
valuablo to the organization. I think.  
Mark Sauer [President] and Ted. 
Simmons [General Manager] are doing 
a great job. Were a small market city 
and in order to survive you have to have 
a good farm system which I think we 
have. Were asking some kids to fill 
some big holes. We signed some veter
ans [Lonnie Smith, John Candelaria, 
and Alejandro Pena] to spell them out 
this season until the young guys get 
their feet wet. I think its a great way to 
go. Hopefully we can do well.
After losing Bonds, Doug Drabek, 
Danny Jackson, and Jose Lind, few are 
picking the Pirates to win their fourth 
consecutive division title. But I like. ;

winning team than just the players. -1

year after year for 31 seasons to operate ! 
tho clock. The Tartans are not notod as 
a baskotball poworhousc, so whats tho 
draw? Is it his great seat at contor court? 
The beauty of Skibo Gymnasium? The

Have you been to a Carnegie Mellon 
football game in the last 12 years? 
How about a mens basketball game, 
sometime during the last previous 31 
seasons? Well, if you have, a man has 
been there who is responsible for one of 
the most vital components of the con
test. No, not the hot dog salesman. Im 
talking about the clock operator.
The clock operators, much like refer
ees and officals, thrive on the lack of 
attention paid to them, but... make a 
bad call or forget to turn off or reset the 
clock, and they can quickly become the 
targets of fan abuse.
Carnegie Mellons clock operator is 
Elmer Gray. I had the pleasure to speak 
with him before a recent game.
Gray is a native of Pittsburgh. At 
South Hills High School, he earned 
varsity letters in baseball, football, and 
basketball.
After graduation in 1943, Gray en
listed in the Army and was stationed in 
Hawaii until 1945.
While there, he played in the base
ball service league. This lead to a ca
reer in professional baseball which con
tinues today.
From playing in the service league, 
I had two people who were involved in 
professional ball tell me after the war 
was over to get in touch with them. 
They were going to help me try to get 
into pro ball. I went to spring training 
in 1946."
Gray spent five years in the St. Louis 
Browns minor league organization, 
earning all-star honors twice as a sec
ond baseman. He 
then moved on to 
the scouting 
ranks.
I never made 
much money in the 
minor leagues.
And I got married 
and started having 
a family. I decided 
I best get a job. So 
I played semi-pro 
ball in the 
Dormont area of 
Pittsburgh. The 
Browns put me on 
as a contact man 
for a couple years 
and when they betheir division six times and the pennant 
four of those times.
They lost the World Series to Balti
more in 1970 and Oakland in 1972, but 
then won it back to back in 1975 and 
1976 over Boston and New York.
Gray told me about his scouting expe
rience during this period.

ers like Ken Griffey, Tommy Lawless, 
and Lynn Jones. They were the main 
ones that made the big leagues. I guess 
you can say Griffey had a great career.
Yes, you could say Ken Griffey had a 
great career.
While a member ofthe Reds he batted 
.312, hit 60 home runs, and batted in 
424 runs in nine seasons. Ho was alBO 
selected as the MVP of the 1980 all-star 
game.
Gray had a homecoming of sorts when 
he joined tho Pittsburgh Pirates as

made me a parttime staff mem

Gray stayed with the Orioles for 13 
seasons before moving on to the Cin
cinnati Reds organization followingthe 
1967 season where he was named 
Scouting Supervisor.
Much of the success of the Big Red 
Machine" can be attributed to Gray.
During his tenure, the Reds won

Hockey team wins big
By ERIC STRAUSS
Tartan Assistant Sports Editor
The Carnegie Mellon Hockey Club outgunned 
Allegheny College 11-6 on Saturday, as gradu
ate students Dave Umland and Scott Sarbacker 
posted hat tricks with three goals each. Fresh
man Roger Maddalena had three assists, while 
sophomore Dan Kodesh and freshman John 
Clisham had two goals each.
A brawl with 3:53 left in the game, however, 
cost the team Sarbackers service for the remain
der of the contest as well as the teams next game, 
on Saturday at Kirk Nevin Arena in Greensburg 
against Indiana University of Pennsylvania.
Thirteen different Tartans made the score 
sheet, with the other goal coming from sopho
more John Cardillo, who also had an assist. 
Other assists came from graduate student Dave 
Collins and senior Ted Miller, who had two each,
I i
sophomore Greg Jessop, junior Jon Hutchinsoii, 
Gary Keim, sophomore P. J. Mann and senior Mikle < 
Gallin.
CMU jumpod out to a 2-0 loud in the first period, 
as Sarbackor scored twico in the gamos first soven 
minutes, but Allegheny stormed back to tio thp 
game in the second period. Umland scored to help 
the Tartans regain the lead, but Allegheny tullieii 
two more goals to go up 43.
Clisham and then Umland scored to put the 
Tartans ahead 5-4, but Allegheny tied the game u|p 
at five. Sarbackers third goal put the Tartans'* 
ahead for good, and ClishamB second goal sealed! 
the game.
Allegheny scored their final goal to make thai 
score 76 before the Tartans tallied the last fou r 
goals of the contest.
The win raises CMUs record to 6-1 and keep s 
them in the thick of the West Penn College Hockey 
Association playoff chase.
Women lose two over weekend in UAA
WOMEN, from page 9
would-be baskets and making key field goals.
The pumped-up style of play, which has given the 
Tartans the success it has, momentarily stifled the 
Rochester team, which has struggled in its UAA 
matches so far (4-5 record). With 3:37 to go in the 
second half, CMU finally took the lead, and contin
ued to pick apart the struggling Rochester team. 
CMU, with its superior defensive ability, picked off 
many of the key passes in the game, severely 
limiting Rochesters shooting effort. With one 
second remaining, Rochesters junior guard Libbie 
Tobin sunk a three pointer to put CMU away by a 
54-52 margin.
We just didnt play well [on Friday], said Coach 
Gerri Seidl. We werent rebounding, and it took 
five to six tries to put it in. I told the team after the 
first half, there are only three hard workers out 
there. Apparently Rochester wanted it more than 
we did. She also mentioned that the team missed 
a lot of easy shots, but there was nothing that could 
be done.
The second game of the weekend, a Sunday 
afternoon matchup with the Brandeis Judges, 
proved to not be a heartbreaker, as the women got 
blown out by 30 points, 68-38.The early game saw 
both teams with ineffective offenses. Megahan, 
who had produced a 29 point effort a week ago, was 
missing many key shots in which she was open.
Halfway through the first period, the Judges 
were leading by eight points. Many of the other 
CMU players were also missing key shots, and the 
stealing and accurate scoring by the Brandeis 
team didnt help the Carnegie Mellon effort any.
The first half saw the women shoot only 22.9% 
from the floor, and 25% from the free throw line. 
Going into half-time, the entire team looked dis
pleased, faced with a 12 point deficit, down 28- 
16.The second half was not much better, with 
Brandeis shooting only getting better and the 
Tartans falling by the wayside. At times, the team 
looked like a very ineffective squad, and at others, 
it looked like a good college team. The inconsis
tency in the entire game proved to be a problem, as 
it cost them the win. The score told the story of 
play, with Brandeis holding a commanding and 
blowout-style lead of more than 30 points for a 
good portion of the second half. CMU also found 
itself in foul trouble, giving Brandeis the 1+1 
bonus twice in the game. The scoring was a poor 
effort, with only Megahan (10 points) and McKnight 
(15 points) breaking the 10 point mark.
The womens team is now 8-9 overall and 4-5 in 
the UAA. Although the team didnt want to see 
such a lopsided loss again, it will only help them 
grow and get better, as their youth will carry them 
in the coming years.

Black History Month
CMU honors heritage
By LAURA PALANKER
Tartan Features Editor
Although the official Black History Month cel
ebration begins nationwide today, Carnegie 
Mellons celebration started last month with the 
campus-wide celebration of Martin Luther King, 
Jrs birthday. All semester long, events will be held 
to celebrate the achievements of black men and 
women throughout history.
The activities began with Martin Luther King, 
Jr.s birthday celebration on Monday, January 18. 
A memorial service was held in Skibo Ballroom, 
followed by a speech from the Reverend Jason 
Barr, a pastor from the Macedonia Baptist Church 
in Pittsburgh. The speech, entitled Where do we 
go from here? Nonviolence: Learning It, Living It, 
Teaching It, was aimed to reach the youth who 
have manifested their anger and rage in such 
channels as violence and gangs. We need to em
ploy nonviolence in this nation as a philosophy of 
life... Kings nonviolent theme can still be used to 
address our current problems, said Barr. Also 
included in the event was a musical performance 
by Carnegie Mellons Voices United Gospel Choir. 
The service was followed by a reception and candle
light vigil to honor King.
The next event in the series, Malcolm X: The 
Man and the Mania, took place on January 20 in 
the Wherrett Room. Lee Kiburi, chairman of the 
Malcolm X Holiday Commission, discussed and led 
an interactive discussion on the ways in. which 
Malcolm X and his messages have been perceived, 
the commercialism and the symbolism of X, and 
the impact of Spike Lees 1992 movie.
Last Friday, January 29, the Black Faculty and 
Staff Association (BFASA) presented Delorese 
Ambrose, adjunct professor at the Heinz School 
and president ofDelorese Ambrose and Associates. 
Ambrose spoke about diversity in the work envi
ronment and its effect on employees. Ambrose 
emphasized that the learning process must begin 
with the very young to initiate change.
Today, on the official start of Black History 
Month, Spirit is handing out free balloons to kick 
off the months festivites. This Saturday, February 
6, Carnegie Mellon will start Black History Month 
with an evening of entertainment and celebration 
of black history and tradition. The evening will 
feature an African storyteller, a musical perfor
mance by the Voices United Gospel Choir, and food 
and fun for everyone. Be in the Skibo Ballroom at 
8 pm to take part in the festivities.
Tuesday through Thursday, February 16-18,
Vendor Fair will be in Grey 
Matter. They will sell everything 
from woven clothing items to na
tive African food between 11 am 
and 4 pm each day.
On Saturday, February 20, at 5 pm 
in the Wherrett Room, the campus 
will celebrate leadership within 
African American communities wit] 
the Perspectives discussion panel.
Guests will express their opinions 
the need for strong African American 
leadership. Distinguished guest 
speaker Dr. Cornel West, professor of 
religion and director of the Afro-American Studies Program at Princeton Uni
versity, will speak on Blacks and Jews:
Conflict and Coalescence at 8 pm in the 
Ballroom.
Spirits Annual Fashion Show returns on 
Saturday, March 6, in the Skibo Ballroom. The 
show, entitled Rhythm and Blues: The African 
American Legacy Through Music, will incorpo
rate education of black history and its contribu

Education encourages diversity
By ANDREW SPROULE
Tartan Asst. Features Editor
Dr. Delorese Ambrose, adjunct 
professor at the Heinz School of 
Business and president of 
Delorese Ambrose and Associ
ates, gave a lecture titled Diver
sity in the Workplace. The event 
was sponsored by the Black Fac
ulty and Staff Association 
(BFASA), and was just one of the 
many programs that are planned 
for Black History Month. The 
lecture was' designed to give 
people an understanding of what 
diversity actually is, 
how it affects the work 
environment and how to 
be sensitive to that 
changing environment.
Ambroses background 
helps one see why she 
would be an expert on this
topic. She started as a ---------
secretary for a Wall Street 
company and went on to get a 
doctorate and become a full time 
professor at CMU. She has been 
on the board of directors for a 
bank, school districts, and vari
ous other business groups. 
Ambrose is also a managing con
sultant for total equality with 
such entities as Westinghouse, 
Alcoa, and the city of Chicago.
The lecture opened with 
Ambrose saying, It is my goal to 
get a dialogue going. She did so 
successfully. Instead of the ex
pected one hour lecture, she in
volved the entire audience. She 
spoke of how the workplace was 
changing and that diversity was 
going to become a part of the 
workplaceoutofnecessity rather
than political correctness. The 
Baby Boomer generation didnt 
produce as many offspring as 
their parents did, she said. 
Ambrose also pointed out that 
the workforce is shrinking and 
the needs of the workplace are 
still in existence. Therefore, em
ployers need to start meeting the 
needs of workers that were pre
viously shut out because of their 
differences from the mainstream.
Throughout the lecture, 
Ambrose kept bringing the dis
cussion back to how these prob
lems affected CMU faculty, staff, 
and students. Hence, it made 
them feel much more immediate 
than if she had just generalised.
There are some things that; are 
needed to help change happen. 
New workers need to have people 
to mentor them and models to 
follow. People need to come to

she said. People neqd to

Ambrose suggested

portantly is the idea she wanted 
to leave with the audience. 
Change can come from any
where, Bhe said. Apparently, she 
feels that people aro too caught 
up in having change coming from
difficulties with diversity in the 
workplace, Ambrose had the au
dience break into groups of two 
and tell each other of a time 
when, as she said, you felt dif
ferent. Afterthegroups had time 
to discuss, Ambrose asked people 
to share some of the storieB. She 
then pointed out how none of the 
experiences were positive, saythe top and moving down hieraring, Nobody talked about winchy. Ambrose has seen change

Pittsburgh Literacy Initiative 
invites students to teach
By LAUREN HEINZ
Tartan Staffwriter
In his Inaugural Address last 
Wednesday, President Bill
their students. Youre teaching 
them that its all right to fail, that 
everyone does. This gives them 
some confidence and helps them 
build up their self-esteem. When
Clinton sounded like a young you are illiterate and dont have
John F. Kennedy as he chal
lenged Americans to commit 
themselves to a season of ser
vice. Workers from the Pitts
burgh Literacy Initiative (PLI), 
an outlet ofGoodwill Industries, 
apparently took this message 
to heart Wednesday 
night as they urged 
CMU students to 
make a difference 
and volunteer as tu
tors within their pro
gram.
With current sta
tistics showing ap
proximately 27 mil-------------
lionadultsintheU.S. 
to be functionally illiterate  
or lacking the basic skills 
needed to perform everyday 
functions at home and work, it 
becomes obvious that PLI is a 
service withamission. Students 
of the school are primarily in
mates from the Allegheny 
County Jail and Jail Annex (for 
women). Other programs take 
place in drug and alcohol reha
bilitation centers sponsored by 
the Salvation Army, YMCAHomewood, and House of the 
Crossroads.
Students of the school are 
taught skills in reading, writ
ing, and math on a one-to-one 
basis and can also be prepared 
for the GED or other job place
ment programs. But literacy for 
these students can mean more 
than just learning basic skills. 
For many, it will give them the 
chance to read to their children 
for the first time or to write a 
letter to a loved one.
The purpose of PLI, explains 
D avid Fraiberg, a Planning and 
Operations Manager at PLI, is 
not solely to teach basic skills 
but to also build a trust with
these skills, you can feel really 
alone. Our program makes the 
future seem more real. For the 
first time in their lives, they may 
be able to provide for their chil
dren, Bays Fraiberg.
In such a one-to-one discussion, 
it seems inevitable that emotional

bonds will form. Fraiberg was 
shocked years ago during one of 
his first sessions with a student 
to find she had graduated from 
high school but now only tested 
at a fourth grade reading level.
As it turns out, she was from an 
economically disadvantaged fam
ily and during her years of school
ing had handed over her home
work to her sister so she could go 
out to work for food. Considering 
the lower economic status and 
poor family backgrounds of the 
majority of these students, such 
accounts are common.
Their stories are phenomenal, 
says Wendy Baker, a recorrectional services agent at PLI.
Its amazing to find so many of work with them here on camthem slipped through our educapus. The purpose of the trainingis a life skill. It is the perfect 
opportunity to take what you 
learn in the classroom and ap
ply it to real life, he says.
Volunteering also looks very 
impressive on a risumi and 
could be the deciding factor in 
job placement, because it shows 
devotion, concern, and aware
ness for an important issue. It 
can also help to round off an 
academic day with an opportu
nity to meet and help people. 
Most of all, its fun, says 
Fraiberg. We are 
dedicated people 
who are making a 
difference in some
ones life. Our stu
dents are thankful 
as are our tutors. 
Dave Potter,
-------------- Housing area coordinator and CMU 
coordinator for the program, 
also talked of the benefits of 
volunteering at Wednesdays 
meeting. Its a long-term op
portunity that is going to affect 
your life. Its a commitment with 
an amazing benefit. You have 
no idea how much you are help
ing these people, says Potter.
With comments like these, its 
no wonder so many CMU stu
dents signed up to be a part of 
PLIs program. Interested tu
tors are required to attend a 
nineto 10-hour training ses
sion on February 6 and from 
then will either tutor students 
of PLI at the Annex or jail or 
may have the opportunity to
tional systemit happens every 
day. I believe that opportunity 
costs, and when these students 
are coming from such poor educa
tional backgrounds with little or 
no family supportcomponents 
which are so crucial  it just 
breaks my heart, says Baker.
According to Fraiberg, the ben
efits are extensive, both academi
cally and personally. Volunteer
ing session is to acquaint stu
dents with certain sensitivity 
exercises, techniques for teach
ing reading skills and how to 
set up an individual work plan 
with their students.
Anyone who missed the meet
ing but is interested in becom

Campus legends live on 
in architecture stories
Schlag's Nose
by Graham Gibby
To start off, much thanks to the folks 
who responded to last weeks column. As 
a neophyte columnist, I tend to ramble 
and hope to continue the trend.
Dan Holbrook, doctoral history stu
dent, had a point on the Baker Hall 
downgrade (not my word): I have never 
seen any factory design that includes a 
slanted floor, and if you think about it 
for a minute, Baker Hall would make a 
horrible factory. Where would the ac
tual work take place? In the rooms off of 
the hallway? How practical is that, with 
all the movement through doorways 
etc.? Well, I have to agree on that one. 
He also points out the danger of run
away carts and dollies. I wonder if In
structional Technology has a problem 
with that, and if so, whats the highest 
speed attained by a Mac Quadra-andmondo-screen cart? Id hate to see that 
slipping out of my hands. Holbrook 
makes one more point: Andrew Carnegie 
was many things but stupid was not one 
of them. Now that I think of it, how do we 
even know Carnegie himself had any
thing to do/say about the design of Baker 
Hall? Was he even alive when it was 
built?
Well, Dan, I went to the office of the 
Architectural Archivist, Martin Aurand, 
and learned that Baker/Porter Hall, then 
known as Buildings A, B & C, were built 
in 1905-06, thirteen years before 
Carnegie died in 1919. So chances are 
good he had some knowledge of its de
sign.
On Skibo and Donner, which seem to 
top most Ugly Building on Campus 
.lists, they were built about six years
apart, Donner 1952-54, Skibo in 1960. 
The architects for Skibo were Lawrie & 
Green, who also did the library. You 
could say theres some architectural con
tinuity there, but why mention them at 
all? Perhaps I am a bit harsh, but some 
things should not be left unpunished. 
The alumni-son/architect-on-acid story 
will be hard to pin down, but your trusty 
reporter will do his darndest.
Another question from Holbrook  
tour guides have been heard to say that 
Hunt is aluminum, which he doubts. 
The fins separating the windows are 
aluminum, but the frame is one that fits 
the architectural theme of this column 
though. Crystal Trexel (sophomore, in
dustrial management) got it from Unix 
Systems Manager Esther Filderman 
who is some descendant of Hamerschlag, I think, Crystal says. Here goes:
The tale about Hunt is a fun one. It 
was told to me by the great-nephew of 
Arthur Hamerschlag (the ex-president 
of the University). The tale goes that 
Hunt was going to be giving a pile of 
money to a Pittsburgh university for a 
library, but nothing had been officially 
announced. However, it was an open 
secret that Hunt was going to give the 
money to Pitt. One night at a party full 
of Pittsburgh bigwigs, the then-chancellor of Pitt (equivalent to our president) 
got a little tipsy and made a pass at Mrs. 
Hunt. Needless to say, both Hunts were 
furious. Shortly thereafter the announce
ment was made  giving the money to 
CMU. There was one stipulationnoth
ing could be built between it and Forbes 
Avenue for X years (I can never remem
ber how many it is). Why? Because the 
Chancellor of Pitt lived up Forbes Av
enue from CMU and would drive past it 
every day and see what he lost out on 
because of his foolishness. Those are 
the stories for this week, folks. If you 
have.answers, questions or corrections, 
please dont hesitate to drop a line at 
The Tartan or send email to gglb.

Coates Invisible Site provides 
virtual virtual reality experience
By FRANK MICHELS
Tartan Assistant News Editor
Did you ever see those commercials 
on television where a packed audience, 
in which everybody looks the same, is 
wearing 3-D glasses? That scene must 
have been videotaped from one of 
George Coates lectures on virtual real
ity. But his presentation on Tuesday, 
appealing to science and fine arts ma
jors alike, dealt with much more than 
three dimensions and virtual reality.
In fact, it dealt with so much that he 
couldnt decide on a proper title for his 
lecture. He originally suggested, In
teractive Media and the Role of the 
Artist, but he was told it wasnt sug
gestive enough. He mentioned other 
titles, but they just werent right. 
Even the central subject of his lecture
 Multimedia  wasnt quite right, 
because he said, The fine arts people 
know its history, and computer people 
think theyre inventing it." Coates fi
nally settled on the title, The Role of 
the Multimedia in an Evil Analog Cul
ture.
The focus of Coates lecture was based 
on the future role of multimedia, which 
is the combination of different sources 
of audio and video into one medium. 
According to Coates, multimedia is the 
answer to two questions: First, what 
kind of art will come from the merging 
of new digital tools with the estab
lished arts disciplines? Second, what 
process of creation will be needed to 
enable engineers, programmers and 
people involved in product design to 
work with actors, dancers, storytell
ers, and directors?
Coates uses multimedia technology 
in productions created by a group that 
he formed, called SMARTSScience 
Meets the Arts. Coates said, SMARTS 
mixes engineers and programmers with 
the traditional stagecraft. His first 
production, Invisible Site, premiered 
in 1991 and ran for five months in San 
Francisco. Invisible Site is the first
music theater production that mixes 
live actors with real-time computer ani
mation with a stereo-optic 3-D set. 
Coates described the effect as like 
watching a movie but where the actors 
are live.
Invisible Site is a 90-minute pro
duction that was condensed into an 18- 
minute slide show, featuring film-projected actors instead of live actors. The 
original production featured live actors 
behind a polarized, perforated silver 
screen. Acomputerimage was projected 
onto the screen, making the screen dis
appear and leaving the image. This 
made the actors look like they were 
acting from within the image.
Invisible Site is the story of a couple 
who connect their nervous systems to a 
virtual reality network and meet to 
enjoy each other for some virtual sex. 
However, they are rudely interrupted 
by an uninvited hacker who has broken 
into the system. He goes by the alias of
Arthur Rimbaud, the 19th century 
French visionary poet, and one of the 
worlds biggest assholes, according to 
Coates. Rimbaud forces the characters 
to assume new personalities of his choos
ing  he calls them digit entities  
and he hijacks their perceptual experi
ence.
Coates describes Invisible Site as 
not a virtual reality experience, but a 
virtual virtual reality experience. With 
a superb soundtrack and excellent dia
log, the action was similar to the graph
ics and situations in The Lawnmower 
Man and probably just as confusing. 
The slide show featured a mix of re
corded actors on filmstrip, projected 
computer animation, and two slide im
ages projected to produce a three-di
mensional image. Images included the 
inside of a cathedral, the rains of an 
ancient desert civilization, and a com
puter monitor featuring animated 
graphics.

This year's Ball brings excitement
MEGAN DIETZ
Iartan Contributing Editor
Ever see one of those smoked 
ieat and cheese trays  you 
now, the ones with all the 
Srange, exotic, yummy, um, 
noked meats and stuff? Well, if 
ju have, then you have some 
lea of what Saturdays Beaux 
rts Ball is going to be like. (If 
ju havent, I suggest you ask for 
neon yournext birthday. Theyre 
ind of cool.)
You see, you get a little bit of a 
it of different neat things, and 
mehow you always feel really 
ultured and sophisticated unrrappingthe miniature sausages 
nd partaking of the delicate 
unks of cheese. Its like tasting 
bunch of different wines, only 
ore filling and less illegal (for 
younguns).
But, wait, you say. What do 
toticmeat and cheese trays have 
do with the Beaux Arts Ball? 
fell, Ill tell you. The Ball promes to be as varied, as interestig, and as cool as any old tray o 
lod  and a lot more fun.
The Ball, which was first held 
n CFA on November 10, 1915, 
as traditionally been an event 
y and for CFA students only, but 
icently it has been opened to the 
ltire campus community, inuding faculty and staff. Accordig to Jeff Kunins, assistant muc director and sophomore H&SS 
ludent, For one evening, everyle on this campus can experilce the thrill of creative expreson and have a kick-ass time 
ling it.
The Beaux Arts committee, 
eaded by Drama Department
alum Alex Steneck, has plans to 
transform CFA into a big wankin 
party, complete with lots of food 
(though I doubt well be seeing 
any strange little sausages), deco
rations, and entertainment. All 
in all, there should be plenty to do
tunity to listen and learn.
Don Caballero, an instrumen
tal quartet, has opened for bands 
like The Jesus Lizard, released 
two seven-inch singles, and been 
hailed as Pittsburghs great inde
pendent rock hope. As of this writand see at the 1993 Ball, themed 
Noctuma Tempora (Times of the 
Night).
Music
Approximately 15 bands will 
grace four performance areas, led 
by Atlantic recording artists King 
Missile, a nutty foursome out of 
New York City whose songs in
clude Gary and Melissa, Jesus 
Was Way Cool, and a new college-radio favorite, Detachable 
Penis. This band is really funny 
and should fill CFAs grand hall
way with happy tunes from their 
latest release, Happy Hour.
Several areabands are perform
ing as well, and if youve always 
meant to find out about the Pitts
burgh scene but never had the 
time, the Ball is a perfect oppor
/lCel, rNJs tClSaNn
ing, the bands members are in 
Chicago recording with producer 
Steve Albini (of Sonic Youth and 
Big Black fame), but theyll be 
back for the Ball, as well as 
WRCTs Winterfest the following 
weekend.
Other established local bands 
set to perform include R &B leg
ends the McKeg-Lawson Blues 
Band, jazz group Something Else, 
hard rockers Burning Bridges, 
and Chill Factor International, 
who play basically reggae, with 
elements of hip-hop, calypso, jazz, 
and R &B mixed in, according to 
guitarist Herman Pearl. This 
Pittsburgh-based six-piece band 
is currently working on its fourth 
release, and Pearl describes their 
stage show as a lot of fun. Weve
hit a really creative time in the 
bands development, and we're 
just going to put on a manic-type 
show.
CMU students will also be per
forming in bands such as Kin
dred, ajazz-based funk group who 
plays regularly at the Decade, 
multi-media experimenters 
Whole Cloth, and Boot Skootin, 
described by vocalist Ed Lee, a 
junior economics major, as a kind 
of rockin funk thing.
Drinking Bone, a band com
prised mostly of CMU members, 
plays music that makes you re
ally homy, according to sopho
more H&SS major Randy Funke, 
guitarist. But seriously, the 
bands mix of funk, blues, jazz, 
and rock and roll makes for a fun 
show. We like to mix it up and 
keep it fresh by not playing any 
song the same way twice, says 
Funke.
CMU-based funk band Fat 
Albert will also be performing, 
even though guitarist Oliver 
Kollar says, I dont... like playingin this band. Its kind of goofy. 
Everybody else in the band is 
totally into jazz, and Im influ
enced by all kinds of music. Im 
sure everyone else would say that 
theyre influenced by everything, 
too, but its not true. Should m ake 
for an interesting group dynamic, 
at least.

Ball. The themes of the early Balls 
dealt with geographical places, such as 
the Orient, the Middle East, and Rus
sia, that were considered intriguing at 
the time. Later Balls retained the air of 
intrigue but choosing to concentrate it 
on an idea instead of a location. The 
1953 Contradiction and Contrast and 
the 1954 Bal Bleu illustrate this as 
well as 1990s Risorgimento.
After its glory days of the 1910s and 
1920s, existence has been a struggle for 
the Beaux Arts Ball. In the early 1930s, 
the Student Council tried to abolish it, 
calling it excessively decadent. The 
Ball developed quite a reputation as a 
huge drunken brawl, especially since 
the Ball was open to Fine Arts students 
only. The Balls were canceled in the 
1940s as a result of shortages of money,

dition of the Ball was 
thought to be old-fashioned 
and out-of-date by the stu
dents ofthis period. In 1979, 
the Black & White theme 
ushered the Beaux Arts Ball 
back into the Carnegie 
Mellon scene. The tradition 
was resurrected inthel980s 
and 1990s with 1981s Bal 
Fantastique, 1985s
Night, and 1990s Risorgimento. 
Todays difficulties harkening back to 
the shortages of money that plagued the 
Balls of the 1940s.
The rules of the Beaux Arts Ball have 
changed over the years. It was, at one 
time, open only to Fine Arts students. 
Later, the Ball was opened to the entire 
campus.
The old rules that required that one 
had a date to be admitted and that 
prohibited costumes that were sugges
tive of the opposite sex have disap
peared, being replaced by a new rule 
that prohibits the serving of alcohol, 
which is a result of a student death 
caused by the mixing of alcohol and 
sleeping pills after 1985s Ball.
All in all, the Beaux Arts Ball is one of 
Carnegie Mellons most interesting tra
ditions. Try to think about all the gen
erations that have enjoyed the tradition 
before as you wander around the College 
of Fine Arts building on Saturday night 
and Sunday morning.

Ball to offer more than just cheese trays
BALL, from L9
stuff.
Jugglers will be juggling. Dancers Sympo
sium will be dancing. There will also be a foam 
block room, which sounds fun, even though 
Im not quite sure whatthe foam blocks are for.
In short, if youre bored at the Ball, its your 
own damn fault.
Food
The food will be catered by Carnegie Mellon 
Catering, and there will be a lot of it. As 
committee member and sophomore IM major 
Crystal Trexel puts it, [CMU] Catering is 
actually really good. I've even had good sea
food from them.
Food will be served on the upper two levels 
of CFA at a 50s diner and a New Orleans jazz 
club.
The CFA mezzanines will become lounges so 
that people can come down and hang out and 
eat their food, says freshman dramat Beth 
Chambers, publicity director for the Ball.
Breakfast will also be served in the wee 
hours of the morning.
Answers to common questions
Yes, its a masquerade ball. If youre not in 
costume, then you should come in formal 
clothes with a mask, if you can find one.
No, you cannot buy tickets at the door. In 
fact, the last time you can buy tickets is Wednes
day at 5 pm.
Theyre available at the Skibo Information 
Desk, at the table in the Kiltie Court, and in 
front of the Fence, and they cost $32.50 each.
Yeah, it sounds like itll be worth the price 
lots of food all night, 15 bands, palm readings, 
dancing, jugglers, casino stuff. The tickets are 
kind of expensive, but it seems like the final ! 
product will be worth it.
So if you can dig 30 bucks out of somewhere, 
you should try to go. Its one of CMUs few 
remaining traditions, you get to dress up, and, 
all in all, the Beaux Arts Ball sounds like a lot ; 
more fun than spending Saturday night at I 
home withHBO and a tray of salami, crackers, 
and brie.

Last Tango in Paris
If youre a Marlon Brando fan, youll want to 
check out Last Tango in Paris. This Bernardo 
Bertolucci film caused quite a stir when it came 
out in 1973, and its still considered explicit, 
even by todays standards.
Its the story of an expatriate American in 
Paris who tries to purge the bad memories of his 
wifes suicide. He enters into a racy but tragic 
no questions asked sexual liaison with a chance 
acqaintance.
Last Tango in Paris is considered to be one of 
Brandos best.
It also stars Maria Schneider, Jean-Pierre 
Leaud, Darling Legitimus, Catherine Sola, 
Mauro Marchetti, and Dan Diament.
At 6, 8:30,11 pm.
Friday, February 5
Of Mice and Men
Of Mice and Men is the latest big screen 
adaptation of John Steinbecks Of Mice and Men.
It stars John Malkovich (Dangerous Liasions, 
Empire of the Sun, The Killing Fields, Places in 
the Heart), Gary Sinise (True West, Miles From 
Home), and Sherilyn Fenn (TVs Twin Peaks, 
Two Moon Junction, Wild at Heart). Sinise both 
acted and directed.
Its the tragic story of George and Lenny, two 
ranch hands that dream of having a place of 
their own. George watches over the feeble-minded 
Lenny.
Fenn as the wife of the ranch owners son 
seduces Lenny and then claims that he raped 
her. George is forced to make a hard decision 
regarding Lenny.
At 6, 8,10 pm, midnight.
Saturday, February 6
My Cousin Vinny
There is no mistaking that My Cousin Vinny 
is one of the best movies that Joe Pesci has ever 
starred in.
The movie is nonstop laughs from beginning 
to end and it makes you wonder just how many 
hilarious cases of mistaken identity can actually 
occur in one movie without making you say, Oh, 
come on!
Pesci stars as Ralph Macchios cousin from 
Brooklyn who ventures into the heart of the 
south to save Macchio from being convicted of 
murder. No, he doesnt break him out of jail 
either.
It seems that Pesci happens to be a lawyer, 
and even though he barely passed the bar, has 
never had a trial case before and doesnt know 
what court procedure is. He has no doubt that he 
can defend his cousin on a murder charge.
I give the movie a 10 on laughs and a 9 for a 
lively storyline.
At 5:45, 8,10:10 pm, 12:20 am.
Sunday, February 7
Thing With Two Heads
In this, the ultimate blaxploitation horror 
movie, Ray Milland (Beau Geste, Dial M for 
Murder, The Last Tycoon, Love Story), a racist 
brain surgeon with terminal cancer, arranges to 
have his head transplanted onto the body of a 
death row inmate, played by Rosey Grier.
The two, as one, spend the rest of the film 
running around, riding a motorcycle, yelling at 
each other, and punching each other in the face.
Occasionally Milland is spared running around 
on Griers shoulder as a dummy head is substi
tuted. Chelsea Brown plays the convicts girl
friend.
At 6, 8,10 pm, midnight.

Waltz comes to town
By JENNIFER FORBES
Tartan Copy Manager
Youd think that a play about AIDS would be preachy, a play 
meant to elicit certain emotion, including sadness and fear. The 
Baltimore Waltz, written by Paula Vogel, takes a different ap
proach  humor.
Vogel, whose brother died 
from AIDS, introduces hu
morous situations (and the 
character with whom Anna 
and Carl interact are hilari
ous). These parts, however, 
are punctuated with seri
ous scenes.
The Baltimore Waltz, now 
playing at the City Theatre 
in the South Side, opens 
with Anna (Laurie Klatscher), the main character, 
learning that shes afflicts 
with ATD (Acquired Toilet 
Disease).Apparently, this 
deadly disease preys on un
married elementary school 
teachers and is acquired 
from toilet seats. Anna de
cides to take a trip to Eu
rope with her brother, Carl 
(Paul Ford), as a last fling.
The trip includes every
thing you could want in a 
European vacation. Theres 
sightseeing and adventure, 
not to mention some intrigue 
concerning Carls stuffed 
rabbit. Anna sleeps with a 
variety of men, from a 
Munich virgin to a German 
student activist.
The last scene, however, 
explains the entire play.
Anna imagined the entire 
trip while sitting by her brothers hospital bed, where Carl was 
dying of AIDS-related pneumonia.
Vogel pokes fun at medical-speak, homophobia, doctor visits, 
one-night stands, and death. In one particularly good scene, Anna
Cast bring laughs with Baltimore Waltz.
goes through all six stagos of dying (denial, angor, bargaining, 
depression, acceptance, and hope) in tho courso of fivo minutes, 
while a bowildered Carl tries to deal with hor moods.
In another hilarious scene, Carl, discussing paintings as ho won
ders through tho Louvre, is juxtaposed with Anna and a nameless 
French garcon having sex in another part of tho stago.
The play also deals with serious issues. It spoaks about tho fear of 
death in an interesting scone with tho Little' 
Dutch Boy, who at age 60 recounts standing 
with his thumb in the dike, listening to the' 
water pound against it and hoping it wouldnt1 
give way. In another scene, Carl meets with 
a black-marketeer hoping to get drugs that; 
will help Anna. The black-marketeer admits 
that the drugs are worthless  he makes 
them in his kitchenand says, if you want 
to be a millionaire, you go into real estate. If 
you want to be a billionaire, you sell hope. 
The acting was wonderful. Klatscher, a 
CMU graduate who appeared in Nicholas t 
Nickleby, deftly handles the humorous mo
ments and moves the audience in the scene 
when Carl dies. Ford, in the role of Carl, is 
terrific.
However, the real star is Will Bond who 
plays every other character. Hes hilarious' 
in his roles of the various men Anna has sex' 
with as well as a suspicious airport security 
guard and an insane Viennese urologist. He . 
plays over 10 characters and had so many 
costume changes, I lost count of them all.
Thedirector, Jed Allen Harris, who teaches 
at CMU, uses lighting and music to add to 
the dream sequence of the Europoan trip., . 
The lighting of thoso scono is softor and 
ofton uses various colors. Music accompa
nies those sconos. Tho sconos in tho hospital 
are in a stark white lighting and tho lack of 
music is noticoablo.
The Baltimoro Waltz manages to strike 
an excellent balance botweon humor and 
seriousness as it takes on an oxtremely 
seriouB and important issuo. This is ono 
play that I highly encourage everyone to see.
It plays at City Theatre through Sunday, February 14. There aro 
student ticket prices.
You can call the box office for more information at 431-4900.

New VanDamme movie has plot
By JASON HEINLEIN
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
Well, Jean-Claude VanDamme, 
of Lionheart, No Retreat No Sur
render, and Universal Soldier 
fame, is back in another action 
adventure. However, the audi
ence might not see what they are 
used to. VanDammes character 
in this film is very different from 
what we are used to.
Although he still plays a tough 
guy named Sam who can kick 
some major ass, he fights more 
like a street fighter than he ever 
has before. In fact, I dont remem
ber seeing one kick throughout 
the entire movie. For some rea
son I just expected more kick 
for my dollar.
It seems that VanDamme is 
trying to back away from the 
martial arts stereotype so he can 
get into more serious acting. Now 
I can respect that, but it just 
seems like he is wasting his best 
talent.
I just feel like if I leave one of 
his films without seeing one of 
his famous splits, Im not getting
my moneys worth.
In the beginning of the film 
VanDamme is on a prison bus 
headed across the country, who 
knows where or why. After an old 
friend of his drives past the bus 
and swerves in front of it, the bus 
flips onto its side. Needless to 
say, after freeing everyone on the 
bus, they both escape  almost.
In an attempt to hide from the 
cops, VanDamme goes camping, 
ditches the car, and meets his 
newneighbor, played by Rosanna 
Arquette, by spying on her and 
breakinginto her house. I couldnt 
figure out exactly why all he steals 
is a salt shaker but who knows, 
maybe they didnt have salt in 
prison.
The movie might have been a 
major success from a womans 
point of view. My dates usually 
dont get into the blood and guts 
fighting scenes like I do. They 
prefer to see the romance scenes 
in addition to as much of the 
stars body as they can.
Well, they wont be disap
pointed by this movie if thats 
what they are going for. 
VanDamme gets pretty hot and 
heavy with Arquette in addition 
to showing off some skin in a 
swimming scene.
From a comedy aspect, the film 
definitely had merit. There are 
more funny scenes in this film 
than ever before in a VanDamme 
picture. The boy who plays
Arquette's son in the film is part 
of the reason why. He acts just as 
you would imagine a young boy 
should and, in the process, says 
some pretty funny things.
The laughs continue when 
Arquettes daughter sees 
VanDamme naked and later com
ments on the size of his bodily 
features. VanDamme gets more 
laughs out of the funny situa
tions that hes thrown into than 
he does by his dialoguo, but I 
guess if that works for him then 
he should keep it up.
I would recommend this movie 
if you want some comedy, bare 
skin, and action all mixed to
gether. I would give it an 8 on 
laughs and a 7.5 for a moderate 
storyline that keeps you inter
ested.

the role of the tuba in 
this weekend's program:
All the Bruckner 
symphonies have really 
nice roles for the tuba. 
Bruckner wrote a lot of music 
on the organ and that tells me 
the type of sound he wanted 
a very deep and weighty 
approach for the brass.
