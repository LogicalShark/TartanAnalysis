the advantages of teaching the hands 
to do the work of the mind. A reso
lution looking to the elevation of la
bor, and suggesting that the hands be 
so taught and so skilled that the ar
tist would at the same time become 
the artisan and they would go hand 
in hand.
So dont forget that, boys from 
Maryland, there are lots of other 
things that you can claim for your 
State, and especially the fact that we 
have in Maryland a technical school; 
it has not the equipment that this 
school has, but it has done a wonder
ful good. I remember soon after I be
came Governor, of visiting that insti
tution and being impressed by the 
young men and young women that I 
met there at night, learning to perfect 
themselves in their chosen vocations. 
Whenever I find a boy that will earn his 
bread by day and go to a technical school 
at night to fit him better for his work, 
I know that that boy will win successI know that there are many in the city 
of Pittsburgh who do likewise, many 
who toil during the day and come here 
at night to perfect themselves.
Remember one thing, young men, 
there is no success in life without en
ergy, without grit. The opportunities 
for technical men outside of the old 
antique professions ave very great. I 
will wager that the laborers in vari
ous mechanical lines in this country 
to-day are receiving more salary and 
making more money than the physi
cian, and especially the ministers, and 
the lawyers. There is plenty of op
portunity for you, there are fields open 
for you when you are equipped. But 
dont walk out from this institution 
and think you know it all. You know 
there are so many fellows when they 
get their diploma, go out into the 
world thinking they know it all, and 
many people wonder how one small 
head can carry so much. Work 
makes the man and the want of it the 
felon.
The life, the career and example 
of the great philantropist who estab
lished this institution should stand 
out as an encouragement to each of 
us. Not only has he made a success 
of life from a financial standpoint but 
from a moral standpoint. Carnegie is 
a good man.
I wish you Godspeed in life; I hope 
you will grow up to be good AmeriBell Phone 292 J Schenley

country; I hope that you will be inde

your convictions. I dont give a cent 
for the boy who goes through life and

The Junior Prom Committee, con

Steen, Merrill, and Burnside, have 
been busy securing information re
garding a promenade. It is almost a 
certainty that it will be held in the 
gymnasium of the new Margaret Mor
rison Carnegie School.
Mrs. Hammerschlag and Misses 
Smith and West, have given the committee a number of valuable sugges
tions. The affair will probably be 
held about May 1.

GOVi S/UTe/ VISI/S /foHi
Governor Edwin S. Stuart of Penn
sylvania, visited the schools last Wed
nesday. His active interest in the 
growth and welfare of our school im
pelled him to rise early and come here 
on his way to the train. He was wel
comed by the faculty, after which he 
talked to the Plebes. He said:
You will find men who say that 
there is not the same chance for young 
men to-day that there was 25 years 
ago. I want to say to you that there 
is a greater chance for men of integ
rity, industry and ability than there 
ever was in the worlds history. There 
is particular use for men coming from 
such an institution as this.
There is only one royal road to 
success. First, and above everything 
else, is integrity; second is industry. 
And if you have those two things and 
respect for the majesty and suprem
acy of the law there is an opportunity 
for every in this school, and every 
man in the country.
I wish you all sorts of success in 
the future and I hope to live to be able to see some of the young men in 
this room to-day not only leaders in 
business enterprises, but also leaders 
of this great and wonderful city of 
Pittsburg.
At the conclusion of his speech the 
students arose in mass and sang the 
alma mater song.

It was warm and comfortable in the 
Physics class room on the evening 
of January 28, and the voice of Mr. 
Lowe had a particularly soothing ef
fect on a certain member of C-l. The 
subject under discussion was velocities 
and this same member in his notebook 
has the vague note which reads: Velocities-Constant and uniformly accel.Falling bodies
About this time his eyelids became 
heavier and in a moment had fallen. 
Simultaneously with the dropping of 
his eyelids he plunged bodily into the 
subject and a falling body (this time 
a human body) became, instead of an 
abstract example of a dry principle 
of physics, a startlingly vivid, realis
tic and indefinite quantity. Things of 
which he previously had had a hazy recollection, and though unworthy of 
note, now recurred to him with horri
ble distinctness. The fact that in 
falling a body gains in speed each 
succeeding second did not impress him 
very much at one time; but now in 
the hour of his trial he realized and 
recognized that unless he soon landed 
he would be dashed to pieces when 
he struck the rocks toward which he 
was speeding, but which seemed to 
drop with speed equal to his own.
How and what he thought as he was 
going down, down, were certainly 
marvels of compression in view of the 
fact that in the short time of his 
aerial flight he crowded a review of his whole life; from the infant crusti
ness of his babyhood and the perni
cious activity of his boyhood and 
youth, his many sins of commission 
and omission since then to a prayer 
for a merciful unconsciousness to 
spare him the rude and forcible shock when the end came.
He hears a loud rumble which seems 
to him to shake the very foundation 
of the earth (but which he later ana
lyzed as the shuffling of the feet of 
his dismissed class-mates.)The end which he so much dreaded 
was the strangest part of his strange 
experience. Instead of the rude shock 
which should mark the end of his selfsacrificing act in the interest of sci
ence, he was more than pleased with 
the gentleness of the gradual transition from a madly-rushing, revolving body 
to a somewhat tired and sleepy, but 
still safe student. The haze through 
which he could scarcely penetrate 
gradually lifted, his benumbed and 
terrified senses grasped ideas with 
more ease and the sharp pinch of a 
stick-pin on his gently nodding chin 
completed the process of awakening 
and he was able to pile out with his 
class-mates, none of whom were any 
the wiser for his having tried to ex
periment with a falling body by him
self fallingfast asleep.
---------o---------
1911 oKTSS Mff/IcGi
On Feb. 11, in the Assembly Room, 
the night men of 1911 held a class
meeting, and a remarkable meeting it 
was. It was remarkable in that it 
brought out a quorum of members, and 
that while in session they did something.
Prior to the call to order a group of the most active members patroled the main corridor and captured enough to make a quorum. A great shout 
went up when the thirty-fifth man was 
piloted into the hall. Quite a few 
members came in late, and on the 
whole the meeting was the best at
tended of any held this year, due no 
doubt to the drastic measures adopted. 
There were several lively tilts be
tween the members, and it was only 
after considerable difficulty that Pres
ident Harley, with the able assistance 
of the Marshall, was able to maintain 
a semblance of order and parliamentary dignity.
The action of the social committee in extending to the Mandolin Club a 
vote of thanks on behalf of the class 
was ratified.
A discussion was indulged in con
cerning a suitable motto for the class. 
The matter was referred to the con
stitution committee.
Two amendments to the constitution 
to meet new and changed conditions 
were adopted after a little discussion.
Mr. McCully offered a resolution to 
the effect that the class foot-ball team 
have numerals awarded them. The 
matter was referred to the athletic 
committee with a recommendation 
from the class to the proper authority 
on that subject.
A member of the social committee 
asked for suggestions from the class 
as to what they wished by way of a 
social diversion. The first thing sug
gested was a banquet, and was as 
promptly knocked by quite a num
ber of members. The only objection 
offered was the lack of originality in the holding of a banquet. For the 
benefit of those who prate of original
ity, the writer would ask them to try 
to recall the old saying, There is 
nothing new under the sun. The 
idea of the banquet, as explained by 
the member who suggested it, was to 
have a banquet conducted along orig
inal lines and without kidnapping 
stunts or melodramatic accessories 
which seem to have taken great hold 
in the banquets of modern times.
Other forms of diversion were sug
gested, but the class did not seem to 
care unanimously for anything, thus 
leaving the social committee in grave 
doubt as to the attendance and successe of any event they might ar
range.
The meeting adjourned during a 
heated discussion, and no doubt the 
next meeting will prove a greater suc
cess than this one was as everyone 
is anxious to have his little say and 
promised to come out and say it.
That is the way it should be and we 
will all be better for it if everybody 
has a show.

How much class spirit would be

all right, but certainly are the finish

With all the publicity being given

It is highly improbable that the 
grave grammatical error of the editor 
escaped the notice of anyone who read 
the last edition of the Tartan. It was 
a mistake of the most childish order, 
and preposterous to believe (and 
some did) that it was necessary 
to take the matter up with the edi
tor to prevent a similar occurrence 
in the future. I am glad to say that 
the large majority of my critics ex
cused the mistake on the Errare est 
Humanum plea, and said no more 
about it. Some, however, have not 
yet ceased in their prattle. I agree 
with Shenstone, who says: Critics
must excuse me if I compare them to 
certain animals called asses, who, by 
gnawing vines originally taught the 
great advantage of pruning. Yes, 
they do some good!

OnThursday evening, Feb. 14th, the 
M. M. C. S. was given a practical il
lustration of what energy and good 
management will do in the planning 
and giving of a most successful enter
tainment. The reception given to the 
day girls by the associated night 
classes is accepted by all as the so
cial event of the season. From be
ginning to end, the affair was with
out a hitch and left in the minds of 
the participants the memory of a most 
enjoyable evening.
Red was the color used for decor
ations and heaits and streamers were 
most charmingly combined to make 
the rooms attractive. The music Was 
provided by some of the members of 
the Glee Club, who entered into the 
spirit of the thing with as good a will 
as the guests themselves. Besides 
dancing, there were several interest
ing games to enliven the evening, and 
after partaking of most stylish re
freshments, the guests left with a feel
ing of hearty good will toward their 
sisters, the night c^ass, and with sincerest congratulations for the able 
committee in charge.
Observe what you see, Means?
The girls of the night classes of the 
M. M. C. S. wish to thank the members 
of the Mandolin Club for their kind
ness in assisting with the entertain
ment of Thursday evening. Come up, 
boys, and well make it personal. L.

The Associated Night Classes of the 
M. M. C. S. gave' a very delightful and 
enjoyable Valentine Party to the Day 
Class of 09. The rooms were gaily 
decorated with red hearts, crepe pa
per and pennants, and the glow of the 
red shaded lights, pretty girls in light 
dresses and gay music, made an at
tractive picture and transformed the 
dreary corridors into a festive scene. 
In the Assembly room dancing and 
songs obtained. In the English class 
room both teachers and scholars tried 
to catch the Dodger asleep. In an
other room blindfolded girls decorated 
the board with pigs, while in the sew
ing rooms, to the strains of a grand 
march the girls viewed a table filled 
with good things and adjourned to an
other room to write a list of the 
articles they had observed. Miss Gwynn received a pretty basket of 
fruit for a list of 67 articles from a 
possible list of 75. Diainty refresh
ments were served in the dining room, 
where the decorations were in keeping 
with the day.

Fully three teams reported for the 
regular practice last Saturday after
noon at E. L. A. Gym. A great fight 
is now in progress among the players 
for a place on the varsity team. John 
Anderson, the noted athlete and South 
Side basket-ball player, has kindly 
volunteered to coach the squad, 
rather late in the season for basket
ball, several games have already been 
scheduled by manager Le Roy Decker. 
Now, fellows, let us back up the team. 
Go out and watch the practices, thus 
showing the interest in athletics es
sential to their success.
