A Phi 0 looks 
into elections
By JENNIFER FORBES
Tartan News Editor
A Phi O has received four com
plaints regarding the Student 
Senate elections on November 
14 and 15. Three of the com
plaints were unsigned.
Two of the complainants 
claimed that the polling table 
was not open or people were not 
able to findit. Another complain
ant reported that a student put 
two ballots in the ballot box. The 
fourth complaint, which was 
signed, questioned the influence 
ROTC exerted in the elections.
A Phi Os election board is 
responsible for looking into these 
complaints. The board will hold 
its meeting today to decide what 
they are going to do about the 
complaints. Jeffrey Woodford, A 
Phi O elections chair, said, We 
have several recommendations 
to give to the Committee. 
Woodford plans to suggest that 
the committee proceed with an 
investigation. However, the
Election Committee can decide 
not to pursue an investigation of 
the charges. The committee has 
other options, which include 
annulling the election and redo
ing it or letting the results stand 
as they are.
The complaint concerning 
ROTC questions the legality of 
the write-in campaign. A second 
complaint about ROTC was 
lodged, but later withdrawn.
Woodford wants to look into 
all four complaints. However, 
the three unsigned complaints 
will be harder to investigate. 
Woodford is encouraging any
one with information concern
ing any of the allegations to con
tact-him.
The elections have not been 
declared over yet, so the newly 
elected Senators are not able to 
take their places in Student Sen
ate. A Phi 0 decides when the 
elections are officially closed. 
Until they come to this decision, 
the current Student Senate re
mains in office.

The Metacurriculum Task 
Force met last week and dis
cussed the ways in which the 
faculty-Student Affairs interac
tion could be enlarged. The 
metacurriculum, according to 
David Banks, chair of the task 
force, is to enhance the social, 
spiritual, athletic, and personal 
growth of students. The main
as a result of the April 1991 
report of the Graduate Student 
Concerns Committee. The report 
contended that graduate stu
dents lacked financial and aca
demic support and social, per
sonal, and educational opportu
nities.
The November 13 resolution 
points out that graduate stu
dents comprise a substantial per
centage of students enrolled,
issue is for the student to learn 
more outside of the classroom.
The task force, which is part of 
the Commision for Undergradu
ate Education, talked about the 
students extra-curricular activi
ties at Carnegie Mellon Univer
sity. Some task force members 
believe that too many students 
lack the motivation or curiosity 
to explore the range of extra
curricular activities that are 
made available. Another idea
that graduate student con
cerns in general are distinct 
from concerns of undergradu
ate students, and that sev
eral examples of important 
problems unique to graduate 
students have arisen in the ( 
past and have been addressed 
in a strictly ad hoc manner 
by the administration. Dean 
of Student Affairs Michael 
Murphy said, Qualitatively, 
Im certainly in agreement 
with GSO and particularly 
[graduate student] needs as 
distinct from undergradu
ate.
In order to give graduate 
students some of the atten

that came out of the meeting is 
that students are perhaps nar
rowing themselves by focusing 
primarily on the grades in this 
highly competitive environment 
rather than the fun of being at 
college. The emphasis on grades, 
according to opinions given in 
the meeting, actively discour
ages the exploration of CMtPs 
smorgasboard of extra-curricular activities.

Members of the gay commu
nity and ROTC gathered at last 
Tuesdays Student Senate meet
ing to debate the controversial 
resolution against discrimina-_ 
tion passed on November 5 by 
Student Senate. During the fivehour Student Senate meeting, 
people were given a chance to 
voice their opinions and ask 
questions concerning the reso
lution.
NROTC Battalion commander 
Ken Wilson asked Student Sen: 
ate to repeal the resolution and 
reconsider it. In what continued 
to be a main topic of discussion, 
Wilson called for a referendum, 
since he feels the Student Sen
ate is not a fair representation 
of the feelings of the student 
body. He also said that the Sen
ate intentionally kept the reso
lution a secret from the public 
until it was passed.
Wilson said that if Student 
Senate wants to honestly say 
that a majority of the campus 
agrees with the resolution, then 
a referendum is absolutely nec
essary.
Senate Member at Large Pat 
Mooney agrees. He has orga
nized a petition to force Student 
Senate to hold a referendum on 
the resolution. According to Ar
ticle 7, Section 2 of the Student 
Senate Constitution, if a peti
tion of 250 signatures is acquired, the Senate must hold a 
referendum within 3 weeks of 
validating the signatures. 
Mooney is aiming for 500 signa
tures before Thanksgiving 
break, forcing a campus-wide 
vote sometime during the end of 
January. There is little doubt 
that we will lose this, he said.
Academic Affairs Committee
Chair Mike Tomblyn feels a ref
erendum would not be appropri
ate. It would be very misguided 
figures, he said, pointing to the 
fact that only about 6 percent of 
the campus community usually 
votes on a referendum. Tomblyn 
feels that the only people who 
would vote on a referendum are

THIS JUST IN.,,______________
Cuomo reveals tax plan but nothing else
WASHINGTON, Nov. 22 
(DJ) Mario Cuomo released 
his plan for a U.S. investmentled economic growth strategy 
and denied that his extended 
deliberations about a presiden
tial campaign are hurting other 
Democratic contenders efforts.
The Ne w York governor urged 
the Federal Reserve Bank to 
inject $20 billion to $25 billion 
into the banking system if 
major banks agree to make new 
loans to small-and-medium-size 
businesses. He said $20 billion 
of new capital would support 
$100 billion in new lending.
It would be the Federal Re
serve taking an equity position 
in the banks, which the banks 
would be required to pay back 
after 10 years, he said in a state
ment released after a telephone 
interview. Unless Washington 
takes action to strengthen the 
healthier banks, Washington 
will end up holding the bag for 
the bankrupted ones.
The governor also reiterated 
his support for a federal net in
vestment tax credit for produc
tive machinery and pollutioncontrol devices, a new capitalgains tax rate of about 10 per
cent to apply only to new and 
productive investments, an in
crease in the research-and-development tax credit to 30 per
cent and, in time, liberalization 
of depreciation schedules.
Though still officially a non
candidate, Cuomo said his pre
scription for a national economic 
recovery is intended to force the 
Bush administration to stop 
sparring with him and to ad
dress economic issues. Im try
ing to get them engaged every 
way I can, he said.
The governor didnt indicate 
how he would pay for the tax
cuts, or whether the Fed could 
pump billions of dollars into 
banks without that having an 
inflationary effect.
Insisting that he isnt a 
ditherer, the governor said 
he has no timetable for making 
a decision about a run for the 
White House.
Last summer, in an address 
before the American Stock Ex
change, Cuomo floated the no
tion of a new top income tax 
rate of 38 percent, saying that 
it could be accompanied by a 
reformed capital-gains tax 
structure (that) could slide from
33 percent on short-term invest
ment gains to 10 percent, or 
even zero, on gains resulting 
from investments over seven 
years old.
The New York governor said 
in the conversation that his plan 
represents his evolvingperspective on the economy and isnt a 
final proposal. I might add to it 
tomorrow or the day after to
morrow, he said. I wont 
change the principles, but I 
might add to it.
Cuomo said last month that 
he was considering a presiden
tial campaign but, despite en
treaties from national Demo
cratic leaders that he come to a 
decision, he still isnt prepared 
to plunge into the race or to stay 
on the sidelines.
I dont know how [the deci
sion] comes out, he said. There 
is no necessity for me to make a 
decision [soon]. Nobody is being 
hurt.
Cuomo dismissed comments 
from Democratic leaders who 
have said that the governors 
reluctance to announce his deci
sion makes it harder for the six 
announced candidates to raise 
funds and attract supporters.
Bush offers to host 
Mideast peace talks
JERUSALEM, Nov. 22 (AP)
 A Palestinian peace negotia
tor said today that U.S. officials 
will invite Israel and Arabs for 
bilateral talks on December 4 in 
Washington to break an impasse 
over where to hold the meeting.
We were informed verbally 
by American officials about the 
time and place, and an official 
invitation is to follow later to
day, delegate Ghassan Khatib 
told The Associated Press.
But Israeli officials said they 
had not received word from the 
United States. Eyal Arad, a 
spokesman for Israeli delegate 
Benjamin Netanyahu, said, I
that were sent.
Prime Minister Yitzhak 
Shamir is in Washington today 
for talks with President Bush. 
Shamir has suggested Cyprus 
as a compromise, but he was 
expected to go along with the 
Bush administration if Wash
ington was the choice.
Secretary of State James A. 
Baker III had said an announce
ment on the place and date for 
the next round of talks may be 
made after Shamir calls on Bush 
later today.
Since the first round of bilat
eral talks in Madrid, Spain early 
this month, Israel and the Ar
dont know of any invitations abs have been unable to agree posal.
on where to continue the nego
tiations.
Israel at first insisted the ne
gotiations be held in the Middle 
East as a way of forcing the Ar
abs to symbolically accept Is
rael. It wanted the sessions held 
alternately in Israel and the Arab 
countries.
The Palestinians have urged 
the talks be continued in Madrid, 
saying it is a neutral ground. 
The Arab side wants to empha
size the international element of 
the negotiations.
The Palestinians, however, 
also said they would consider 
any American compromise proCongress OKs defense bill
WASHINGTON, Nov. 22 (AP)  Congress 
gave final approval to a $291 billion defense bill 
for 1992 that denies President Bushs request 
for four more B-2 stealth bombers while boost
ing spending on antimissile defenses.
The measure was sent to Bush for his signa
ture.
Democratic and Republican leaders alike 
lauded the legislation as a sober balance be
tween the end of the Cold War and continuing 
threats to U.S. security.
The legislation also reduces the size of the 
military and ends Navy and Air Force bans 
against women flying combat aircraft.
The Senate this morning approved the mea
sure by a wide-margin vote of 79-15. On Mon
day, the House approved the bill on a 329-82 
vote. Bush is expected to sign it into law fairly 
soon.
The legislation lays out defense programs for
the fiscal year that started Oct. 1. A separate 
bill actually providing the money has passed 
the House and is awaiting Senate approval.
Bush had requested $4.8 billion to continue 
buildingthe B-2, a radar-evadingbomber that, 
at $865 million per plane is the most expensive 
aircraft ever built. The Air Force wants 75 of 
them, and 15 have already been approved.
But Congress decided to limit Bush to $4.4 
billion, $1.8 billion to keep production lines 
open, $1.6 billion for continued research and 
development and $1 billion for one new B-2 
bomber.
For that particular plane to be purchased, 
the Pentagon would have to certify that the B2s numerous problems have been solved and 
the House of Representatives and Senate 
would have to vote their approval again next 
year. The House disapproves of any farther 
production.
New bill protects banks from environmental liability
WASHINGTON, Nov. 22 (DJ)  
Commercial banks and some other 
kinds of financial institutions would 
be protected from potentially unlim
ited environmental cleanup liability 
under legislation approved by the Sen
ate.
The banking bill that cleared the 
upper house of Congress on a voice vote 
late yesterday would modify the 
Superfund Act and other environmen
tal legislation to clarify that certain 
lenders and federal agencies such as 
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corpo
ration and Resolution Trust Corpora
tion cant be held responsible for the 
costs of cleaning up polluted proper
ties in situations where they had no 
direct role in causing the contamina
tion.
The proposed changes are a high 
priority of the banking community, 
Federal agencies charged with resolv
ing bank and thrift insolvencies and 
other problems, and the Federal Re
serve.
The Federal Reserve is in support of 
the changes because it believes the 
existing situation is contributing to 
the so-called credit crunch.
Many and various environmental 
groups, on the other hand, are strongly 
opposed to the changes the bill would 
bring.
In contrast to the Senate bill, bank 
reform legislation cleared by the House 
yesterday doesnt address the environ
mental lender liability issue in any 
way.
That and other differences in the two 
bills will have to be worked out and 
both bodies will have to approve a final 
compromise measure in a conference 
committee before such legislation can 
be sent to President Bush for his ap
proval.
B anks and other lenders thought they 
were sufficiently protected from envi
ronmental cleanup costs under certain 
provisions of the original Superfund 
Act, but various court decisions in re
cent years have interpreted the law 
differently.
As a result, some banks have begun 
withholding loans from businesses that 
use chemicals or other potentially harm
ful substances in their operations and, 
somewhat ironically, have been reluc
tant to finance environmental cleanup 
activities.
In addition, certain banks have, in 
some cases, simply walked away from 
those properties which are held as loan 
collateral and accepted default on 
troubled loans rather than engaging in 
workouts with the borrowers.
Elsewhere, senior officials of the 
FDIC and RTC have expressed their
concern that the cost of clearing away 
insolvent banks and thrifts could in
crease substantially absent certain 
types of envionmental liability pro
tections for their activities.
The Senate-passed bill would ad
dress both the concerns of private 
sector institutions and the federal 
agencies.

[jDse who think they are being 
hurt by the resolution.
According to junior psychol
ogy major Chris Wood, a referenium is simply not necessary,
people only put up with 
discrimination for so long. 
Chris Wood
since Student Senate has al
ready passed the resolution. 
Student Senators are elected to 
those kind of decisions, 
he said. Wood believes that put
ting every important issue to a 
referendum is not what a rep
resentative democracy is all 
about.
Most of the Senators are in 
favor of the resolution and have 
not changed their position on it. 
CFA Senator Amy Blake said, I 
firmly believe [my constituents] 
would have asked me to vote 
this way.
IM Senator Tatsu Ikeda is also 
in support of the resolution. I 
think it is our job to stand up to 
the authorities and say [discrimi
nation] is wrong, he said.
Actions like those made by 
Carnegie Mellon University and 
other campuses have had an ef
fect on the national level, as evi
dent by the agenda of the recent 
national Naval ROTC confer
ence. The issue of discrimina
tion within ROTC made its way 
to the national level. According 
toTomblyn, It was on the Na
val ROTC conference agenda... 
andconcemed students who give 
a damn about whats right got it
resolution, but Wilson feels that 
the members of cmuOUT have 
no incentive to compromise since 
the resolution has been passed. 
Wilson believes that for it to 
work, the current resolution 
should be repealed so cmuOUT 
has an incentive to draft a new 
resolution. What they should 
have done was ask us to do that 
to begin with, said Wilson.
During the meeting, a paper 
was distributed listing 55 schools 
across the country that have 
taken some action against ROTC 
discrimination. The actions in
clude protests and calls for ter
mination from students, facul
ties and administrations. Five 
schools have decided to termi
nate ROTC by a given deadline, 
including M.I.T. and the Uni
versity of Pennsylvania. Four 
other schools have refused to 
start or reinstate their ROTC
there.
Mooney was surprised at the 
speed that the resolution was 
pushed through Student Sen
ate. It doesnt clearly explain 
the feelings towards the Depart
ment of De
fense, he 
said.
Mooney 
also believes 
that the 
sponsors of 
the resolu
tion should 
have con
tacted people with dissenting 
opinions during the drafting of 
the resolution. Wilson shares 
this belief and brought up this 
point Tuesday night. They owe 
it to us to let us know ahead of 
time, said Wilson, who believes 
that Student Senate should have 
contacted ROTC when they were 
considering the 
resolution. It 
shouldnt have 
been a secret, he 
said.
It was suggested 
at the Student Sen
ate meeting that 
ROTC students get 
together with 
members of cmu
OUT to draft a new 
resolution and 
present it to Sen
ate. Both sides 
seem willing to 
meet, but no defi
nite plans have 
been made yet.
Wood said, cmu
OUT welcomes 
ROTC students to come and talk 
with us on the problem.
Wilson and other ROTC stu
dents are eager to draft a new
Wood, pointing to the growing 
concern nationwide with dis
crimination within ROTC. Re
ferring to the schools nation
wide which have taken action on 
this issue, Wood said, Its time 
CMU caught up with them.
Wood feels the resolution 
should not be of prime concern 
to Student Senate any more in 
dealing with the discrimination 
in ROTC. Other things need to 
be done, he said, such as ROTC 
cadets joining forces with other 
students to work on a very ac
tive letter writing campaign. 
He also sees communication with 
staff and faculty as a necessity.
Even though the administra
tion has no plans to terminate 
ROTC programs on campus, 
Wood believes that with addi
tional pressure from other 
sources, the administration 
would consider different actions.

Task Force investigates

From TASK FORCE, page 1
The amount of classwork at 
CMU was also given as a reason 
for students inablility to join in 
the extra-curricular activities. 
To this point, committee mem
ber Erwin Steinberg said that 
for the money parents pay for 
their childrens tuition fees, they 
should want them to work at 
least 50 hours per week includingin-class time as well as study 
time, instead of the currently 
believed 33 hours.
A few ideas were presented 
that will attempt to make life 
outside the classroom at Carn
egie Mellon a little bit more fun 
and livable. According to Banks, 
this does not mean less work, 
but rather more enjoyable work. 
One proposal toward this end 
suggests changing the residence 
hall concept at Carnegie Mellon 
to something like MITs. At MIT,
there are theme dorms, like a 
athletic wing, a Dungeons and 
Dragons wing, a volleyball floor, 
a religious floor, and so on. Ac
cording to Banks, It would be 
nice to have a system like that.
Banks also said that if a stu
dent is happy he or she will have 
more enthusiasm for learning. 
If you dont like the people 
around you, youll become un
happy. He explained the need 
to promote the idea of having 
fun with work. Work is play, 
play equals work, said Banks. 
He believes a new residence hall 
system would help bring work 
and play closer together because 
students with mutual interests 
would be living together.
Another point discussed was 
faculty-student interaction. An 
idea was proposed to assign a 
faculty member to each dorm. 
The faculty member would share
interests with the students and 
possibly act as an advisor and 
teacher at the same time. This 
idea is taken from Oxford Uni
versity of England, where, ac
cording to Banks, student-faculty interaction is very good.
Banks believes that if there 
was something in it for the stu
dents then they would be more 
likely to go to the extra-curricular activities. One proposal was 
to possibly give students credit 
to go to activities. That way they 
would not feel like they were 
wasting time watching a lecture 
when they could be at home 
studying.
Banks said that the plans for 
the future are great, and that 
the Metacurriculum Task Force 
is driving towards a friendlier 
campus, where the student is 
challenged and invited to see 
whats going on.

FCE information must be 
used for improvement
Now is the time in the semes
ter that most students are being 
asked to fill out Faculty Course 
Evaluation (FCE) forms. These 
forms, which are handed out in 
most classes, are used to gauge 
students opinions of certain 
courses and teachers.
Unfortunately, the informa
tion from these forms does not 
necessarily have any impact on 
the campus, either in guiding 
employment practices of the 
University or in informing stu
dents of the quality of certain 
teachers. For the FCEs to be 
worthwhile, their results must 
be thoroughly disseminated and 
given weight in decision mak
ing.
If the FCE is to have any sig
nificance, we suggest that it be 
mandatory for all teachers to 
participate. This includes all 
part-time professors, visiting 
professors, and teaching assis
tants, as well as all assistant, 
associate, and full professors.
All teachers should schedule 
the FCE day ahead of time and 
put it on the syllabus, so any 
students who feel strongly about 
a certain teacher will know what 
day to be sure to come to class to 
give their opinions.
The evaluation sheets them
selves should cover not only 
questions of competence but also 
questions of fairness and equal 
treatment. As it is now, there 
are no questions addressing fa
voritism, sexism, or racism in 
the classroom. These are imporThe mail system on campus 
has inconvenienced, and some
times angered, many students, 
faculty, and staff. A better sys
tem for handling the mail on 
campus needs to be developed in 
order to improve its reliability.
There is a general consensus 
that campus mail is unreliable 
in meeting the internal mailing 
needs of the University. Dated 
campus mail sometimes reaches 
its destination long after the 
event has taken place or the 
deadline for responding has 
passed.
At the beginning of each school 
year the addresses of students 
are not always known or easy to 
compile, and therefore early fall 
mailings are nearly impossible 
to send. Some students miss 
events or dont get important 
information because their ad
dresses are not known or acces
sible.
Other problems arise when 
mail is misaddressed. All too 
often, students receive mail that 
isnt theirs in their boxes. In
stead of taking it to the mailroom 
they stuff it in the molding above 
the boxes in hopes that the in
tended student will eventually 
see it.
This poses a serious problem, 
especially if the mail is in the 
molding at Mudge and the stu
dent the mail is addressed to 
lives in one of the Hill dorms.
Returning the mail to the mail 
room doesnt always solve the 
problem either. If the students 
box number is unknown for one
tant issues that shouldnt be ig
nored on the FCEs.
It is the duty of the University 
to use the information from these 
evaluations and properly act on 
it. The findings should weigh 
strongly in the consideration and 
assessment of Carnegie Mellon 
faculty. The continuing employ
ment and status of tenure for 
teachers should be more directly 
related to the way their stu
dents rate them, and notas is 
sometimes the case  solely on 
the opinion of the teachers su
periors or a grant board.
The information from the 
FCEs, which usually does not 
reach the students, should also 
be properly disseminated 
throughout the student body, so 
that students can know more 
about what to expect from the 
teachers. Though the Univer
sity publishes a book of the re
sults of the FCEs, copies of it are 
few and hard to find:
We suggest that the Univer
sity make the scores more promi
nent by somehow listing them 
in the Schedule of Classes book 
that we use when we register. 
Then students could find out 
the results of the evaluations 
and use that knowledge to make 
registration decisions.
The FCEs have potential to be 
a very powerful tool for evalua
tion, but they are not used effec
tively now. We would like to see 
them maximized for the benefit 
of the entire University commu
nity.
reason or another, the mail may 
repeatedly turn up in the wrong 
persons box.
At a minimum, a solution to 
this problem is for the Univer
sity to buckle down on the mail 
system on campus. The on-campus mail system should be im
proved, and the U.S. mail should 
be handled more responsibly.
The University should also 
compile early in the fall, if not 
before the semester even starts, 
the most thorough address list 
it can for both onand off-campus students. This list should be 
made widely accessible.
At a maximum, a solution is to 
create mailboxes for all students 
and centrally locate them. Stu
dents would be assigned a box 
number freshman year and 
would keep the same number 
for their entire stay at Carnegie 
Mellon.
This centralized system has 
two main advantages: Every
one will be accessible through a 
campus box, and there would be 
little, if any, need for the ex
pense and inconvenience of offcampus mailings. There would 
also be no confusion in the fall 
over where to reach students. 
One possible location for this 
would be in the proposed Uni
versity Center.
Everyone here relies on the 
mail, both campus mail andU.S. 
mail, and irresponsibility is not 
acceptable. The system needs to 
be tightened up, and it needs to 
be high on the Universitys pri
ority list.
Altmann praises Senate 
activity during semester
Editor:
Its been a remark
able term for Student 
Senate. It caps a tran
sition from a low-pro
file, somewhat petu
lant bureaucracy to an active, aggres
sive, diligent body. Weve tackled is
sues of academic policy (freshman over
load, the honor code) and campus life 
(the gym, and bike racks). Weve shored 
up our fiscal policy and found consis
tent directions for persistent problems 
(charity funding, buggy, thefts). And, 
last but not least, weve taken a vital 
and overdue step forward on human 
rights. Gays, lesbians, and bisexuals 
on campus now know from our resolu
tion on ROTC discrimination that we 
support without qualification their 
standing as first-class citizens, even if 
the Department of Defense explicitly 
and the CMU administration tacitly 
deniesit. We made top story on the 
nightly news by doing the right thing 
and by doing it loudly.
I want to thank the ex-officios who 
sat through long meetings to stay in 
touch and refresh us with their per
spectives; the members of the commu
nity who helped drive our projects along; 
Student Affairs for backing us with 
advice and resources; and the Senate 
secretary for battling the bureaucratic 
chaos and winning decisively.
Finally, thanks to my colleagues on 
Senate for making it so much fun to get 
things done. The creativity and com
mitment of theSenators and membersat-large was an inspiration. Everyone 
contributed considerable time and their 
particular talents to the pool. To those 
who leave us, it has been a privilege. To 
those who stay, lets have another great 
term!
Erik Altmann 
SCS, Student Senator
University must adhere 
to discrimination policy
Editor:
I found the discus
sion at the Tuesday 
night Student Senate 
meeting to be very 
rewarding. I would 
like to specially thank Chris Neighbor 
for doing an excellent job as parliamen
tarian and keeping the discussion mov
ing.
I believe the major remaining point 
of contention is that the current resolu
tion threatens to remove ROTC from 
campus. Some of the students in ROTC 
feel this is unfair, while some of the 
students in cmuOUT feel this threat is 
necessary to produce action. However, 
everyone seemed to agree that the cur
rent discriminatory DoD policy needs 
to be changed.
Because of Carnegie Mellons state
ment of assurance, I believe that as 
long as the University continues rela
tions with the DoD that cause discrimi
nation to occur on campus, it is the 
moral and ethical obligation of every 
political body on campus to take the 
most effective action to see that the 
DoD policy is changed. The current 
resolution has proved to be effective in
that it has started a discussion on an 
issue that was previously ignored. A 
similar, but weaker resolution was 
passed by Student Senate a few years 
ago, and promptly ignored.
However, the resolution as it stands 
does threaten to remove ROTC from 
campus, and the students in ROTC see 
this as a problem. Therefore, I chal
lenge the students in ROTC to come up 
with a resolution that will be more 
effective in changing the DoD policy, 
and more agreeable to ROTC students. 
After much consideration, I believe this 
is possible.

Opponents of resolution 
lend implicit support
Editor:
As a gay student and 
member of cmuOUT 
(my views dont nec
essarily represent 
those of cmuOUT) 
who attended the Student Senate hear
ings on the resolution which insists that 
CMU eliminate ties with ROTC compo
nents of the Defense Department (DoD) 
if it continues to discriminate on the 
basis of sexual orientation, I was more 
than a little upset by the ROTC mem
bers objections to the resolution. Let me 
rephrase that, I was upset by their anti
gay assumptions which revealed an al
most complete ignorance of the reality of 
discrimination. These are some of the 
arguments I heard:
By adopting this resolution, you are 
effectively discriminating against me.
In order to avoid all this controversy, 
lets hold a referendum on the resolu
tion. Im sure I can get many people in 
ROTC to swamp the polls and stop it.
I dont even dislike lesbians, gays or 
bisexuals. The DoD makes me discrimi
nate against them.
cmuOUT never contacted us about 
this resolution. And, although some of 
us tried to take control of Student Sen
ate for the sole purpose of overturning 
it, cmuOUT has no reason to suspect 
that we would have tried to prevent it.
If this resolution stands Ill have to 
join a club which doesnt discriminate 
in order to actively participate in Sen
ate funded events. Its unfair to treat 
me like every other student on campus.
Lets rescind the resolution and come 
up with a compromise plan. Since the 
bisexuals, lesbians, and gays would 
have to ignore their principles to get 
anything done, we would have the up
per hand. We dont really want a reso
lution with teeth and would have no 
need to compromise.
I agree with the resolution 100% ... 
its the wording I dont like, especially 
since it sounds as if it might affect me if 
I continue to discriminate.
If you allow gays, bisexuals, and les
bians in the armed forces, then our 
morale will drop, just like the DoD 
says.
DoD policy is clear: engaging in ho
mosexual behavior, admitting to homo
sexual thoughts or associating with ci
vilian homosexuals, results in removal 
from the military. People who willingly 
join a group with such a policy, know 
the policy, and do nothing to change it
 even if they claim to disagree with 
the policy lend it implicit support. It 
is the responsibility of the group which 
gains from an oppressive policy to 
change it, not the responsibility of the 
group it attacks. It is not unreasonable 
for those oppressed to be upset if change 
doesnt happen, and it is not cause for 
complaint if they then take what ac
tions they can to end the oppression.
Members of ROTC sincere in their 
claim to want to end discrimination 
shouldnt make statements which sug
gest the opposite. They should support
 not try to reverse  gains such as 
this resolution, even if it takes some 
small sacrifice on their part.
Tony Brusseau
Senior, Math/Scientific Computing
Professor supports 
resolution about ROTC
Editor:
I want to congratu
late the Student Sen
ate for its strong resoL6tt6f tO 
lution concerning FHifnr
ROTC. I hope the H,e cullur 
Faculty Senate and the administration 
will have the courage to endorse this 
resolution.
It is important to note that ROTC 
scholarships are very different from 
other kinds of scholarships. In order to 
have ROTC students, Carnegie Mellon 
has to accept the whole ROTC pro
gram. The school is required by ROTC 
to accept as professors army officers 
chosen by the Penatagon. These offic
ers must teach what the Pentagon tells 
them and must repeat any lies the 
Pentagon orders them to tell. You will 
not learn from these so-called profes
sors the truth about U.S. aggression in 
Panama or massacres in Vietnam. The 
University provides classrooms and 
scheduling for ROTC courses. It is ab
surd to say that CMU has no responsi
bility for what the ROTC does.
A major goal of the ROTC program is 
to produce conformists who will not 
question U.S. policies. The policy 
against homosexuals is just one way of 
working towards this goal. It is prob
able that the ROTC keeps track of their 
students political preferences as well 
as their sexual preferences.
The goals of the ROTC and those of 
the University are very different. A 
major goal of the University is to en
courage students to think for them
selves. By accepting this discrimina
tory ROTC program, the University is 
compromising its fundamental goals 
and purposes.

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  25 November 19917
Art of courtesy flounders at CMU
The next time I hear someone whine, lm 
soooooooo dead! I have six papers and two 
exams, and that's just this week," I kill. We all 
have a lot of work to do here at Carnegie 
Mellon.... Deal with it.______________________________________________
Jason McDonald
Recently, my Forum colleagues have 
jjgen touching on one of my personal 
favorite topicscourtesy (or lack thereof) 
in society. Cluster reservation wars and 
the fact that one has to be injured to get 
people to act civilized are just a few of the 
manifestations of this phenomenon; the 
fact of the matter is that manners are 
dying out. Im not talking about using 
the proper fork for a salad  just a 
simple sense of decency, 
i I first started noticing it when I got 
strange looks from people when I would 
take two extra seconds to hold a door for 
them. I think they were looking for me to 
pull a knife, or ask them for a dollar, or 
change into a werewolf, or something. 
Funny. I guess Im just one of those 
people who doesnt like having a door 
dropped in my face when Im half a step 
away. Better get me away from the nor
mal folks.
And the rudeness has been getting 
worse. Does this situation sound famil
iar? Youre walking along the Cut, and 
you whip past one of your friends. In
stead of stopping for the 15 seconds and 
carrying something resembling a conver
sation, you let loose a barrage of mean
ingless grunts, or a cryptic Hey there! 
Eventually, well be at the point where 
all conversation will sound like Ms. 
Othmar from Peanuts.
Of course, there is some element of 
practicality here. When Im walking by 
someone, and that person inquires as to 
whats up with me (Ive heard a reason
able suggestion that the phrase Whats 
up? be banned from the English lan
guage), a truly comprehensive answer 
would take me into next week (as well as 
halfway to Pitt, if I kept my present 
course and speed). Since the person is 
usually still moving away from me, and I 
dont have the stretching power of Gumby, 
I usually just keep going myself.
Im convinced that two pieces of tech
nology are behind it allthe automobile 
and the telephone. These two items are 
responsible for most of the ill will in 
society today. The ultra-pessimistic view 
is that they just serve as amplifiers of a 
human nature that tends toward evil, 
but I dont buy that quite yet. Im getting 
close though  a few more episodes of
people cutting the line at the movies, and 
Ill change my tune.
Cars are the major culprit because 
they provide the primary means of vent
ing frustration without any sort of chance 
for repercussion. Since we cant run off to 
a cave and contemplate life when were a 
little down, well just settle for cutting off 
that bastard in the green Buick who 
didnt signal his lane change to our lik
ing! Why not? Well never see this guy 
again, so who really cares what he thinks 
of us? Its a classic case of Im pissed, so 
I might as well make some other people 
mad, too.
This attitude carries over to Carnegie 
Mellon quite well during finals  so 
many people feel compelled to share their 
stressful workload with everyone who 
comes within earshot. The next time I 
hear someone whine, Im soooooooo dead!
I have six papers and two exams, and 
thats just this week, I kill. We all have a 
lot of work to do here at Carnegie Mellon 
 distracting others with your own sob 
story doesnt help anyone else, and it only 
wastes your own time. Deal with it. Or at 
least wait until someone makes the mis
take of asking you how classes are going.
The phone is another source of the evil 
because it allows people to be rude from a 
distance. I love the small army of people 
who get a wrong number, and then hang 
up in a deep snit, without even taking the 
time to apologize for dragging me away 
from the not-so-important things Im do
ing. Like its my fault that they dialed the 
wrong number! Its my personal theory 
that these people are distant cousins of 
the people who walk right between two 
people who are talking, rather than going

sentingit and widely expressing 
whatever radical views they 
choose. I am not opposed to this. 
Everyone should be able to ex
press their views without fear of 
discrimination. However, the 
same people who demand the 
right to voice their opinions are 
often those who attempt to take 
that right from others. Many 
students feel that homosexual
ity is repulsive and wrong. This 
is a viable group with opinions 
which add to the diversity of 
our university community. 
Should this group not be allowed 
to form organizations as well? 
Would not denial of this right be 
reverse discrimination?
ROTC is part of a national 
organization which has certain 
views on certain behaviors, 
namely, homosexual activities. 
It is an admirable organization 
which provides not only finan
cial assistance, but a number of 
other valuable opportunities for 
its members. And yet a small 
group of students, who happen 
to have some amount of power 
and do not agree with its views, 
wish it to be banned. They state 
as their reason that the organi
zation is discriminatory. But in 
their very attempts to ban it, are 
they not being themselves dis
criminatory? They would state 
that the organization provides 
opportunities not available to 
everyone. But is taking away 
those opportunities from every
one the solution? Would it not be 
better for groups with opposing 
views to provide opportunities 
for their members?
The actions ofthe Senate seem 
very like the childish mentality 
which cries If I cant have it no 
one can, and proceeds to break 
whatever toy is forbidden. If the 
individuals on the Senate choose 
to have these views, that is their 
choice. But to impose these views 
on the rest of the campus com
munity is unforgivable. The in
credibly low voter turnouts in 
Senate elections are clearly in
dicative of the lack of represen
tativeness of the Student Sen
ate. And yet, when members of 
ROTC fought to gain seats on 
Jne Senate, many current memers claimed that these newly 
ected students were not repre
sentative and have begun atempts to have them ousted.
The Student Senate does much 
hat is helpful to the University 
and its students. However, they 
need to realize, and the UniverSlty needs to realize, that they 
rePresent a small fraction of the 
Campus population, and to imPse their views on the rest of 
e campus is offensive, wrong, 
actually contradicts the 
diversity policy against discnmination. Clearly, the UniWsity needs to take a look at 
s Problem, and either remove
some of the Senates power or 
take steps to greatly increase its 
representativeness.

Election results In 
sour grapes
Editor:
The opinions 
expressed in 
this letter are LottBT tO 
thoseoftheauVolu ic'^s+^w 
thor only Afthe Edlt0r 
ter reading your sports editors 
column about Student Senate 
elections [Madness begins all 
over again, 11/18], I was deeply 
offended. Jason McDonalds 
statements attempting to link our 
military with David Duke and 
fascism were irresponsible, and 
his complaints about his new stu
dent senators were nowhere fair.
McDonald mentions David 
Dukes candidacy in a column 
supposedly about the Student 
Senate elections, then says that 
theres no direct connection to 
the ROTC/Senate battle here. 
If there isnt, why did he bring it 
up? Similarly, mentioning his 
first thoughts (insults to mili
tary students on campus, play
ground bullies, and fascists) 
and then distancing himself from 
those thoughts in the next sen
tence is not expressing an opin
ion and backing it up, its name 
calling.
He also says that his cam
paign for Senate (resulting in 
four votes for him, 8 for Tatsu 
Ikeda, 13 and 15 respectively for 
write-ins Matt McGarvey and 
Matt Woodhead), based on a 
joke, would have resulted in a 
better representation for his col
lege. Notwithstanding the fact 
that so many more people 
thought that the others would 
do better than he would at rep
resenting them, a person run
ning on a platform of lets get 
four votes and see what hap
pens is not exactly showing a 
dedication to constituent service. 
McDonalds high moral ground 
seems to be a few feet below sea 
level.
As a member of the campus 
community, I felt that I had a 
problem with the wording, if not 
the intent, of the resolution. I 
wrote letters to my senators, put 
out the word who voted for what, 
and became active on this issue, 
as I do for an issue that concerns 
me. I voted for who I thought 
would represent me and that 
vote just might have been one of 
the candidates who were dis
tressed by the system enough 
that they were willing to work to 
change it.
Now that our senators have 
been elected, I am willing to give 
them the benefit of the doubt 
until I see what they do  and
look at my affiliation; my 
colleges Senators are not writeins. Thats being a good citizen. 
Anything else is sour grapes and 
McDonalds column had sour 
ones indeed.

This letter 
addresses 
Germain 
DeSeves col
umn in the 
Forum section two weeks ago 
[Magic faces greatest chal
lenge, 11/11]. Author Germaine 
De Seve addressed Magic 
Johnsons role in reducing the 
prejudice surrounding AIDS. 
Unfortunately, the article un
wittingly furthers discrimina
tion among people with AIDS. 
De Seve states, Magic is a near 
perfect victim. This statement 
says that there are victims, 
people who dont deserve to get 
AIDS, and implicitly states that 
there are people who do deserve 
to die because they are fags or 
junkies. The truth of the matter 
is that people with AIDS or HIV 
are just that, people with AIDS 
or HIV. It is unjust to discrimi
nate further. This is discrimina
tion in its most deceptive form, 
careless statements and subver
sive miseducation that is pro
moted by the media.
It is up to the media to report 
and comment on Johnsons ef
forts correctly and in a way that 
doesnt counteract his mission. 
Traditionally, the media has ig
nored or even worse, misrepre
sented AIDS and people with 
AIDS. Since Magic Johnsons 
going public, we are seeing an 
explosion in AIDS-related dis
courses, however, it looks like it 
must be taken with a grain of 
salt.
With respect to campus events, 
Johnsons attempts to reduce 
discrimination is analogous to 
Student Senates efforts to do 
the same. We as a body have 
voted that ROTC discrimination 
against gays, lesbians, and bi
sexuals is unacceptable. The 
resolution we passed is pro-ac
tive and fully accounts for, as 
much as possible, all the needs 
and concerns for those involved. 
As a senator, I am pleased that 
many individuals took time to 
speak about the issue in a five 
hour long discussion during last 
weeks Senate meeting. Also, I 
am pleased that many people 
from the press and the media 
attended. This says that this 
campus is concerned about dis
crimination and is getting at
tention for standing against dis
crimination.
I close this letter along the 
same lines it opened on; the 
media has a powerful effect on 
the general understanding of 
discriminatory issues. There
fore, people in the media have a 
responsibility to report accu
rately and to comment objec
tively. Please do so.

Festival of Lights 
celebrates miracle
Editor:
A common 
misconception 
about ChanLetter tO
the Editor
Lights, is that it is one of our major 
holy days. In fact, it is much less.
Chanukah, the Hebrew for 
dedication, is a commemora
tion of the Jewish victory over 
the Greeks in battle. The light
ing of the Menorah is to symbol
ize the rededication of the 
Temple in Jerusalem after it had 
been defiled with images of the 
Greek gods. When the Jews re
covered the Temple, they puri
fied it, but could only find enough 
pure oil to light the Menorah for 
one day. Miraculously the oil 
lasted eight days, enough time 
to make more oil. Another cus
tom related to the oil is to eat 
foods cooked in oil each night 
after lighting the Menorah.
Before the Jewish victory, the 
Greeks persecuted the Jews in 
the land of Israel. Among the 
restrictions placed on them was 
religious study. The Jews used 
to study, and whenever a Greek 
soldier came by, they hid their 
books and played games with a 
top. To remember the strength 
and courage of the Jewish people 
at that time we play with a top 
called a dreidle on Chanukah.
These are the main customs of 
Chanukah. Otherwise we run our 
lives as usual throughout the holy 
day. On other more important 
holy days we change our lifestyle 
through the duration. For in
stance, we completely change our 
diets for Passover and every week, 
for the Sabbath, we abstain from 
all types of work for one day. 
Those holy days are from the To
rah, whereas Chanukah was institutedmuchlaterinhistory and 
created by rabbis.
This year Chanukah begins the 
evening of December first and 
lasts through the ninth. Each 
night there will be candlelighting 
in Grey Matter at 7 pm and a 
party on December second also at 
7 pm. Friday night candlelighting 
will be at 4 and 4:30 pm. Every
one is welcome to join in the cel
ebration!

Reservations ben
efit all students
Editor:
I would like 
to address 
Abby SchifPs 
column from 
last weeks 
Tartan, concerning the cons of 
student computer reservations 
[Reservations transform Jekyll 
to Hyde, 11/18].
Schiff, you are not only off the 
mark, but insulting as well. You 
claim that student reservations 
cause problems. Did it occur to 
you that theres a reason we have 
them. A recent post to 
org.acs.students.general de
scribed how one user was shoved 
out of Wean 5202 by a class with 
a last minute reservation. No 
other machines were available, 
so he wasnt able to do his work.
You complained because you 
couldnt do your paper on An
drew. What is the CS major sup
posed to do when the clusters are 
full? You imply that everyone who 
needs to use a computer and kicks 
you off is evil, and yet you use the 
computer yourself. Nice double 
standard youve got there.
And violence? Yes, sometimes 
people make a scene when 
theyre asked to abandon their 
machine, but you make it sound 
as if one needs to wear body 
armor and bring mace when
ever one goes to the cluster.
Your column is nothing but 
paragraph after paragraph of 
immature whining. You get 
booted by a few people smart 
enough to insure that theyd 
have a machine to work on, and 
so you label them offending 
geeks, with foul-smelling 
breath. You seem to think that 
the geek is some race of sub
student, and that only they re
serve computers. Well, I reserve 
computers. I am female, I am an 
art major, and I most certainly 
do not smell.
The only thing I can agree with 
in your column is that yes, some
times people do reserve comput
ers for stupid reasons. I do not, 
however, believe the problem is 
as widespread as you think.
Now I suppose youre wonder
ing, Yeah, but I need to get 
work done, too! Very true. Ive 
been here for almost five semes
ters, you not even one, so Im 
going to tell you what Ive 
learned: If you want to get that 
death paper done, then you, 
like everyone else, have the right 
to reserve a machine. Ive been 
sitting behind a ccon desk for 
four semesters now, and I can 
tell you that, on most occasions, 
the reservation books are almost 
empty. Now get a clue, grow up, 
and quit whining.

Resolution issue produces winners, losers
Chris Restifo
Just about everything that could be 
said about the recent Student Senate 
resolution against the DoD policy on 
gays has been said. It would be rather 
unproductive and senseless at this point 
to try to argue one way or the other. 
Although most people are pretty set in 
their views, I feel some, regardless of 
their positions, deserve some recogni
tion.
First, Id like to say Bravo Zulu (BZ) 
to several people. For those of you who 
dont know whatitis, Bravo Zulu means 
job well done in the military. And I
think the follow people deserve some:
BZ to Mike Tomblyn and Erik Altmann. 
Although I dont agree with the resolu
tion, they were quick to respond to the 
fervor caused by Senates decision. At 
the last Student Senate meeting, they 
had a handout prepared that explained 
their positions and why the resolution 
was .worded the way it was. They were 
also very open and responsive to people 
who didnt like the resolution. Because 
of them, I had to rethink a previous 
stance. Perhaps a referendum wouldnt 
be such a good idea after all.
Abig BZ goes to Student Senate Chair 
Chris Neighbor. During the audience 
participation part of the meeting, he 
kept things under control. He did an 
outstanding job of preventing sense
less bickering and keeping the more 
vocal senators quiet until the audience
had its say. Because of him, the meet
ing ran very smoothly.
BZ to Chris Newman, who spoke for 
the resolution. I heard a great deal of 
moans from the audience when he spoke 
of the suicide rate among gays. He was 
not telling a sob story, as I feel many 
thought, but was pointing out an indica
tor of how gays are affected by societys 
treatment of them. He did an excellent 
job of explaining what the resolution 
meant to members of the gay commu
nity. Some in ROTC see the resolution as 
a personal attack. From what Wood and 
others said, I take it they feel that the 
resolution is something which could ac
tually hurt their cause if it was removed 
or modified.
BZ to Kenny Wilson and Chap Godbey. 
They were perhaps the most level-headed 
and calm people there who represented
the anti-resolution stance. They also did 
a good job of clearing up misconceptions 
about military classes, requirements, and 
certain military procedures.
Of course, some things didnt go over 
too well. Amy Blake, a CFA Senator, 
received a disgruntled sound from the 
audience when she reminded people in 
ROTC that the Germans, too, were just 
following orders. I feel Blake should 
learn the difference between Nazis and 
Germans and the difference between 
immoral and lawful orders. Discrimina
tion is wrong, but there is a big difference 
between excluding gays from the mili
tary and slaughtering millions of people.
Some people out there couldnt get it 
through their thick heads that the reso
lution does not affect groups like the 
Society of the Prow (SOP). Altmann 
even offered to work with groups like
AFROTC and Army ROTC to draft con
stitutions for groups similar to the SOP. 
By doing such, people in ROTC could 
still participate in Carnival under, as I 
believe Altmann called it, a similar 
banner.
Although therewas a good exchange 
of views, I still feel that some people fail 
to see the difference between being a 
member of ROTC and being a student 
against the resolution. Many, many 
times it was pointed out that maybe 
ROTC and cmuOUT could get together 
to work on some possible avenues. 
ROTC cadets and midshipmen cannot 
do such a thing. They must remain 
politically neutral as members of the 
military. H&SS Senator Josh Knauer 
made an issue of the disclaimer that 
ROTC students put out about their,

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  25 November 19919;
Greeks need community
Rich Robinson
From what Ive heard, my last 
column about the IFC and FIPG 
iwas not received well by some 
Personally, I dont really 
if people disagree with my 
or not. All I want is for you, 
the reader, to think about what I 
saying and formulate your 
own opinion, unprejudiced. But 
there was more than disagree
ment involved with my last col
umn.
I got some of my facts wrong. 
The paper didnt catch them bethey trust me to get my 
facts rightas I have done up to 
this point. But I got lazy in col
lecting my facts, as everyone does 
once in a while, and listened to 
some people of the less-informed 
variety. I also got a bit hotheaded 
and didnt present my point well. 
I want to rectify that. However, I 
cannot address any specific probbecause no one has even 
thought to come and talk to me, 
the writer, about my column, but 
instead have gone to people who 
ireally cant answer their ques
tions.
What I was writing about in 
my last column was that the 
Greeks are arguing amongst 
themselves over a comprehen
sive alcohol policy. To me it 
seems like a classic case of the 
haves and have nots fighting 
over something that shouldnt 
even be in question (FIPG) when 
it would be followed through with 
the same laissez faire attitude 
that all IFC policies have been 
treated with.
The thing is that IFC already 
has an alcohol policy that in
cludes some risk management 
and is a step in the right direc
tion. The problem is, as with 
most of IFCs rulings, that the 
policy has not been enforced. 
There are no standards or checks 
and balances that would bolster 
the policys strength and insure 
that it is being followed.
Houses on their own have 
implemented the policy, yes, but 
most of them have not given any 
power to it. The houses that have 
given the policy strength have 
also gone further with it. One 
example is that there is a pro
posal goingup between the cam
pus police of Pittsburghs col
leges that would provide an es
cort service for non-CMU stu
dents. Sober patrols that encoun
tered an intoxicated person that 
could not get home on his or her 
own could call Campus Police. 
Campus Police would, in turn, 
call the students schools secu
rity, which would in turn come 
to CMU and escort the student 
home, without any threat of fines 
or further repercussions.
This idea, as I have heard, has 
already beeninformally accepted 
by CMU, Chatham, and Duquesne. If formally accepted by all 
the Pittsburgh colleges, it will be 
great risk management. There 
will be less chance of people driv
ing while drunk or walking home 
alone and being assaulted. It will 
also hopefully reduce the risk of 
women being victims of such 
crimes as date rape.
But why didnt this idea come 
out of IFC instead of an indi
vidual house? For the past three 
years, I have seen the Greek com
munity splinter apart. This is
reflected in IFC by the lack of 
definite ideas, inability to see that 
good policies are implemented, 
and the constant practice of 
throwing solutions at a problem 
and hoping that one will work 
without actually backing it up 
and following through with it.
That is what I was trying to 
get across in my last column. 
The Greeks have to realize that 
they are a community and that 
they need each other. During a 
period in which administrations 
are trying to get rid of the Greek 
system and our own school presi
dent skirts around the larger 
issues facing the Greeks, dis
cussed at last weeks question 
and answer session, Greek mem
bers need to come together as a 
unified front.
Most of the bickering is point
less. Each house carries its own 
stigma of why individual houses 
say we dont like them about 
other houses. This disunity is 
precisely why the Greeks have 
never been able to do what ROTC 
did two weeks ago  capture 
Student Senate. The Greeks 
have tried before, but have failed 
continuously. They dont go out 
to vote, and when they do, it 
becomes I dont want to vote for 
him, hes a Tau Phi whatever.
Greeks all know that being 
Greek does not mean partying. 
More than ever, Greeks have 
become community service ori
ented, volunteering for the Red 
Cross, Childrens Hospital, Big 
Brothers/Big Sisters, andAdopta-Highway. Non-Greeks dont 
want to accept this fact, though, 
instead relying, on fantasies such 
as Animal House. Greeks also 
have come in with higher aver
age QPAs on campus than over
all campus averages.
People not involved with Greek 
life, though, dont understand it 
and intrinsically distrust it. But 
nothing can be done about this 
without the Greek community 
becoming more unified. Indi
vidual houses have to stop look
ing at other houses as people who 
have something they dont or as 
people to do battle with. They 
need to come together as a uni
fied front against the prejudices 
held against them.
The Greeks here need to show 
that they care more about the 
Greek system surviving as a 
whole than the differences that 
separate them and make them 
unique. Every house is different 
because of its founding, ideals, 
and goals, but all share a com
mon bond of being Greek and 
wanting to perpetuate the Greek 
system.
I know this cannot happen 
overnight, but it can happen. 
Greeks should start small, 
maybe with an all-Greek, nonIFC retreat. Im not really sure 
what would be a good starting 
point, but it needs to be done. 
Greeks have to unify against 
administrators that dont want 
such organizations here and 
people who have misconceptions 
about Greek life. Many great 
men and women have come out 
of the Greek system to become 
leaders in todays society, /know 
why, because I have learned a 
great deal while being associ
ated with Greek life. Its about 
time the Greeks proved this to 
everyone else, as one unified 
group.

To a certain extent, weve 
brought it on ourselves. The 
reason so many people are such

After all, if I can call some

No, then I have no reason to

Womens hoops 
splits at F&M 
tournament
By AMY WILSON
Special to The Tartan
Maybe its a good omen that 
the Tartans lost to Franklin 
and Marshall for the second 
consecutive year, even though 
the Tartans themselves are 
still frustrated by the loss. 
Last season, the Tartans lost 
to F&M, 80-53, but went on 
to win the University Ath
letic Association champion
ship, set a team record for 
victories (21), and finish the 
season ranked 16th in the 
nation in Division III.
With five returning start
ers and several strong fresh
men, this years team could 
better its record this season. 
This is a close team that 
works together both on and 
off the court, which only helps, 
according to assistant coach 
Emma Fischer.
In an extremely physical 
game on Sunday, the Tar
tans fell to Franklin and 
Marshall College, 53-48. A 
basket by F&M in the first
twelve seconds set the pace 
for the game; the Tartans 
quickly regrouped and took 
the lead with 17:31 on the 
clock.
Halftime saw the Tartans 
leading 26-21. Freshman 
Christa Sober was out  a 
violent mid-air collision with 
an F&M player resulted in 
her head breaking her fall to 
the floor. According to senior 
guard Katie Fahey, Sober was 
going upforaballand got her 
legs cut out from under her.
The scene changed in the 
second half when the F&M 
defense tightened up. F&M 
tied the score at 15:36 and 
pulled ahead for good at 
11:21. The Tartans kept the 
game close but werent able 
to regain the lead. An F&M 
basket with four seconds on 
the clock finished the 
game: F&M 53, CMU 48.
High scorers for the Tar
tans were senior guard 
Heather ODonnell with 14 
points and Amy Buxbaum

Women win first meet; 
men drop two straight
By DARYL DAVIS
Tartan Staffwriter
The Carnegie Mellon swim teams had a packed 
schedule this week as they competed in two meets
against strong opponents. On ________________
Tuesday, CMU hosted West
minster College, another divi
sional team. The CMU mens 
team suffered its first defeat of 
the season as it fell to West
minster, 118-87. The women also 
fell to the overpowering 
Westminster team, 119-79.
The men were hurt by the loss 
of two of their starters to 
tendonitis; the injured swimmers 
will be unable to compete until 
after Thanksgiving. The meet 
was closer than the score indi
cated, coach Jim Cutrone said,
as the Tartans did capture sev________________
eral events.
Senior Brian Zimmerman won 
two first place finishes in the 200-yard freestyle 
with a time of1:48.77 and in the 500-yard freestyle 
with a time of4:56.67. Sophomore Anupam Narula 
captured first place in the 200-yard butterfly with 
his time of 2:09.02. Sophomore Todd Vandalls 
time of 10:44,14 won him first place in the 1000- 
yard freestyle, and he took second in the 500-yard 
freestyle with a time of 5:11.91.
Junior Jamie Millar also captured a second 
place in the 200-yard individual medley with a 
time of2:06.22. Sophomore Jonathan Kline swam 
a lifetime best in the 100-yard freestyle (59.28)
Having Thanks
giving break right 
before could 
make it tough, 
but were going 
to go in and swim 
hard.
 Glynis Frost
and junior Todd Beatty swam a season best in the 
50-yard freestyle (23.07).
The women were facing a Westminster team 
that, according to Cutrone, had more depth and 
was a stronger team. Although the Tartans did
_______________ not win any events, there were
members who achieved lifetime 
bests. Senior Anna Lesko wore a 
second place with her season-best 
time of 28.79 in the 50-yard 
freestyle. Freshman Joanne 
Kievan shaved eight seconds olf 
of her 200-yard backstroke to es
tablish a new lifetime best pf 
2:50.11.
The swim teams then traveled 
to Case Western Reserve Univer
sity on Saturday. Case Western 
is a UAA Division opponent. THe 
women swimmers won their first 
meet of the season by the com________________ manding score of 109-67. Tlie
HHH men, still hampered by injuries, 
were unable to top Case Westeijn 
and faced their second defeat 131-73.
The winning womens team capitalized on pow
erful individual performances. Senior Glynis Frost 
commented, It was our first win and we are 
definitely psyched about it. Sophomore Denise 
Fenwick was a triple first place finisher; she won 
fcin the 200-yard individual medley, the 100-yard 
freestyle, and the 200-yard breast stroke with the 
times of2:20.27,57.01, and 2:38.00, respectively.

...But I still 
have to call sixyear-olds Sir
When I originally signed up 
for the PE Departments 
karate class, it was just a 
you-never-know measure 
and six units. After all, I 
havent been in a real fight 
since the fifth grade, but there 
may come a day when someone 
decides to try and separate me 
from my wallet, or someone 
gets drunk and decides he 
wants to throw hands with 
someone.
After a gradual, semesterlong metamorphosis, my 
training in the martial arts 
has taken on a new legitimacy. 
I have my first belt. All right, I 
dont have it yet, but its pretty 
sure, from what I gather. For 
that matter, its not even my 
first belt, but its the first one I 
actually earned.
On the surface, trading a 
white belt for a yellow belt 
may not seem like any big 
change. Passing my belt test 
didnt make me a better 
human being, or grant me the 
ability to break concrete slabs, 
but its still achievement.
The test wasnt required or 
anything. I just felt like doing 
it, so six other students from 
the class and I headed out to 
C.S. Kims studio, where the 
test was to be held. Originally, 
we had enlisted an entourage 
to come along for the fun, but 
most of them slept in, leaving 
just two people in our cheering 
section.
The test itself was an 
interesting experience, and I 
find that writing about it in 
this little space doesnt quite 
do it justice. My first impres
sion was that its hard to not 
feel a little humble when 
youre a lower-ranked student 
than six-year-olds. I know 
egos not supposed to come into 
it, but it feels weird that I 
would have to refer to a preteen as sir.
Beyond that, though, it was 
really amazing to see this 
eclectic mix of people that was 
testing for various ranks. 
Middle-aged mothers, little 
kids, teenagers, college stu
dents  a veritable potpourri 
of humanity  and they all 
study Tang Soo Do (the 
specific variety of karate).
The testing format is basi
cally the same for everyone.
The only differences are that 
the higher belts do more 
advanced techniques, and they 
have to break wood. Its this 
second point of which Im most 
jealous. The adrenaline rush 
one gets just watching other 
People break is cool enough; I 
can only imagine what it 
would be like to actually do it.
Sitting around watching the 
higher belts test was almost as 
much fun as my own test. 
Watching people who really 
know this stuff is a real eyeopener, though there was the 
occasional student who made 
ie cringe with how little he or 
she seemed to know. Maybe it 
Was just the fact that I was 
getting cranky after sitting in 
the same position for almost 
three hours.
the final analysis, it was a 
really great experience, and it 
Promises to be even better 
jtext time. At the very least,
heres a piece of wood with my 
name on it.

Womens soccer

The Carnegie Mellon womens 
soccer team, which played its 
first varsity season this year, 
will begin competing in the Uni
versity Athletic Association next 
season. The Tartans, who com
piled a 10-4 record playing local 
teams, had been a club team 
prior to this season.
Were excited about the pros
pects of participating in such a 
unique conference, which in
cludes several of the most com
petitive teams in Division III, 
said head coach Julie Shackford.

The Carnegie Mellon University 
mens basketball team started its sea
son with mixed results this weekend, 
losing a 6968 decision to Trinity Uni
versity on Saturday before rebounding 
to beat Rhodes College, 100-92, in the 
consolation game of the Carnegie Mel
lon Classic. Trinity ended up winning 
the tournament, beating Colorado Col
lege, 8280, in the championship game.
In yesterdays game against Rhodes, 
the Tartans only trailed once in the 
entire game, and the Lynx never got 
closer than three points after the halftime intermission. Sophomore guard 
Rony Johns led the way for Carnegie 
Mellon, scoring 27 points, including 
five of seven from behind the threepoint stripe.
In fact, the Tartans game was made 
with long-distance sharpshooting  
CMU hit eight of 12 three-pointers. 
Four of them came during the key drive 
of the first half, a 14-3 Tartan run. The 
Tartans went from one point behind 
(2928) to 10 ahead (42-32) in less than 
two minutes.
The Lynx recovered with a sevenpoint drive of their own, but the Tar
tans were on a roll. By the half, the 
Tartans were up 50-43, and they ex
tended their lead to as much as 12 early 
in the second period. Rhodes Andy
the financial situation. It seemed 
like a rather far-reaching thing 
from what we were told.
The major rationale for the 
change involves the level of com
petition in the Pittsburgh area; 
there are very few strong var
sity programs in western Penn
sylvania. The team had been 
playing a mixture of club teams, 
other new varsity programs, and 
small-school varsity teams,-like
Pippinger hit three three-pointers over 
five minutes to drag the game baek 
within reach, but sophomore forward 
Michael Hosni pushed the lead bagk 
toward double digits with under fije 
minutes left. 
Rhodes guard Mike Gonda scored 12 
of his game-high 30 points in the final 
five minutes, but the Tartans were able 
to stay out of reach until Rhodes was 
forced to foul to conserve the clock. 
Junior guard Chris Benecs free throws 
with 24 seconds left put the Tartans 
over the century mark.
Four Tartans posted double-digit 
point totals. In addition to Johns 23- 
point effort, CMU got 18 from Hosiji 
and sophomore center Derek Dragisic, 
and 10 from sophomore forward Matt 
Reiprish. Dragisich and Hosni led t&e 
Tartan rebounders with 13 and 12, re
spectively.
On Saturday, the Tartans lost a harjfought 69-68 battle against Trinity Uni
versity from San Antonio, Texas. Thfe 
lead changed hands (or the game be
came tied) eight separate times during 
the final six minutes.
Both teams flirted with blowout per
formances early. Six minutes into th 
game, the Tartans were out to a 11-4 
lead, and it looked like a rout might bfc 
on. The Tigers battled back to take tl$ 
lead halfway through the period, arid

which point the UAA would be

with 12 points. Rebounding a team specialty 
was not dominated by any one player, yet the 
Tartans won the overall battle on the boards by

down nine, Buxbaum added eight, followed by 
sophomore forward Jeanine Megahan, who cap
tured seven, and Fahey, who picked up another 
six^Eveiyone whoplayedpulleddownatleastone

In the second half, said senior guard Bridget 
Eperthener, they just kept eating away at our 
leacl. We have a tendency in the second half to 
play as individuals and not as a team. Its not that 
we dont have confidence in each other; we dont 
have confidence in ourselves to keep up the lead.
ijecond-half three-pointers by F&Ms point 
guard didnt help either, according to Fischer.
The season opener on Saturday against Wilkes 
University was determined as soon as the Tar
tans scored the first points of the game. They 
never lost the lead, rolling to a 69-55 victory.
Top scorers for the Tartans were Megahan (23 
points), Fahey (12), and Buxbaum (10). Buxbaum 
and Megahan led the Tartans in rebounds with 12 
and 7, respectively. Megahan and Buxbaum were 
both named to the all-tournament team for their 
efforts in the two games.
The Tartans begin defense of their University 
Athletic Association title tomorrow night when 
they host Case Western Reserve University at 6 
pm. Next weekend, Carnegie Mellon will host the 
Thanksgiving Tournament, which will also in
clude teams from Otterbein, Dickinson, and Hei

The on-field outlook is good as

jnthe contest. Back-to-back three-pointers by Trinitys Mike Colquhoun and 
Paul Neuner gave the Tigers a 4840 
lead with 13 minutes to play.
The Tartans offense, helped by Trin
ity fouls, kicked into high gear and 
flent on an 11-point run. Dragisich, 
who had been silent in the first half 
(four points, four rebounds) came to life 
to spark the Tartans. With 2:29 left in 
the game, the Tartans held a slim 62- 
50 advantage, but it was to be their last 
ofthe game. Trinity pulled out to a 66- 
62 lead with time running down.
A Jenkins three-pointer with 13 sec
onds trimmed the lead to one. After a 
tense battleCMU got the ball back at 
6765, but overthrew the full court 
inbounds pass  Trinity extended the 
lead to 69-65. Jenkins beat the buzzer 
with a three-pointer from beyond the 
mid-court line, but it was obviously one 
point too few, leaving the Tartans on 
the short end of the 69-68 stick.
Five Tartans scored in double digits. 
Dragisich ended the game with 14 
points, Jenkins andsophomore forward 
MattReiprishscoredll each, andHosni 
and Johns added 10 points each. 
Reiprish led the Tartans with 11 re
bounds.
The Tartans open their University 
Athletic Association season tomorrow 
night at 8 pm against Case Western 
Reserve University. The game is the 
first of a three-game UAA homestand,

CMU hockey pounds PSW to finish semester
By DAVE MARTEN
Tartan Staffuiriter
The Carnegie Mellon Univer
sity hockey club finished a good 
semester in dominant fashion 
last Sunday night at the 
Monroeville Golden Mile Ice 
Center. Penn State West came 
to Monroeville with an upset in 
mind, but left thoroughly de
ed, 10-4, by the powerful 
Tartan team.
The scoring began nearly five 
minutes into the game on a Penn 
State West goal, sparking the 
PSW team, if only briefly. With 
7:18 remaining in the period, 
graduate student Scott Sar
backer scored with an assist from 
fellow grad student Eric Galis 
the tying goal. Only thirty 
seconds later, senior tri-captain 
Ed Kilduff skated the puck from 
behind the Penn State goal and 
fired a pass to the point, where 
Jan Marc Featherston, a junior, 
spotted up and placed a beauti
ful shot in the net.
Two minutes later, graduate 
student Chris Keim and Galis 
made assists to get the puck to 
Kilduff, who sneaked the puck 
pastthePSW goalieonthepower 
play. With 3:08 left in the pe
riod, Keim again made an as
sist, this one to graduate stu
dent John Cam for the final goal 
of the first third of the game, 
giving CMU a 4^-1 lead going 
into the second period.
Two minutes into the second
period, the Carnegie Mellon on
slaught, down one man at the 
time, continued as graduate stu
dent tri-captain Dave Collins 
passed the puck to Cam, who 
managed to slide it to Kilduff for 
his second goal of the game. 
Exactly one minute later, Galis 
and Kilduff scoredthe assists as 
Sarbacker forced in his own sec
ond goal.
With 10:13 to play in the sec
ond, Sarbacker assisted on Galis 
third point, his first goal of the 
game, making the score 71. 
With 8:38 to play in the period, 
though, PSW caught fire, put
ting one puck past senior goalie 
Dave Sealfon. Kilduff and 
Sarbacker assisted on Galis sec
ond goal of the game before PSW
scored the final goal in the pe
riod to leave the score at 83 
before the intermission.
The third period was much 
quieter for both teams, as penal
ties became the order of the 
evening. For the second shorthanded Carnegie Mellon goal of 
the evening, Kilduff got the puck 
to Keim who fired it past the 
Penn State goalie. With nine 
minutes left in the game, Collins 
and freshman Blair Echols as
sisted senior Randy Walter for 
CMUs tenth and final goal of 
the game on a CMU power play. 
PSW scored a goal with 7:42 to 
finish the scoring, going away a 
10-4 loser.
The win over Penn State West 
was a nice finish to a good se
mester for the Carnegie Mellon 
hockey team. Graduate student 
Scott Berry, the starting goalie, 
played 11 of 15 periods, staving 
off 86 of 92 shots while Sealfon 
had 26 saves on 30 shots in four 
periods.
Standout offensive players 
were Kilduff, who scored nine 
goals and had nine assists for 18 
points on the semester, and 
Galis, who scored eight goals 
and five assists for 13 points. 
Scott Sarbacker also made his 
presence known this semester 
putting in five goals and passing 
off five assists to scorers. The 
team hopes that it can continue 
its dominance throughout next 
semester and challenge for the 
league championship.

Bradley, competing in only her

team, captured a third place in 
the 50-yard freestyle with her 
time of 28.42.
The mens team had to face a 
shaved and tapered, or wellrested Case Western team, ac
cording to Cutrone.
The injuries definitely hurt 
us, said Zimmerman. It means 
were missing some depth. De
spite the injuries, the Tartans 
gave a strong showing in several 
events.

Vandall, Zimmerman, andKlinS'

NFL playoffs clear up 
as seasons end nears
With the end of the semester 
here, finally, we have come to 
the point where everybody 
speculates about the playoffs. 
Being as clich as I am, I too will 
consider the playoffs. Washing
ton has clinched a playoff spot, 
and the Redskins are a step away 
from the NFC East title, despite 
losing their chance for an 
undefeated season yesterday at 
the hands of the Cowboys. Chi
cago stands a chance of taking 
the National Football Confer
ence Central Division with a vic
tory over the Detroit Lions on 
Thanksgiving Day. The Lions, 
though, should be able to ac
quire a wildcard spot in the sec
ond year of the expanded playoff 
system. New Orleans has a 
stranglehold on the NFC West, 
with a 9-2 record, while Atlanta 
(of all teams!) is at second place 
in the West with six wins and 
five losses.
In the AFC, the picture is still 
a little unclear. Buffalo and 
Houston will most likely take 
their divisions easily. The AFC 
Central wont have a wildcard 
team. Look for the Raiders and 
Chiefs to pull down the top two 
wildcard spots and a surprise 
from the New York Jets to fill 
the third.
As far as playoff progress goes, 
though, look for the Oilers or 
Bills to soar to the top in the 
AFC. And in the NFC, does it 
really matter? Washington 
should dominate the action. If 
Washington happens to finish

Ta skfo rkceim
the season as national champs, 
though, I would have to wonder 
exactly what Joe Gibbs did to 
get God on his side. Maybe its 
because D.C. is such a mess. I 
dunno.
Tonight, the NFC West, the 
second worst division in the NFL 
this year, is represented by its 
two worst teams. No, not New 
Orleans and Atlanta, but the 
Forty-Niners and the Rams. 
Strange twist of fate, that. No 
one really cares who wins (okay, 
I dont care who wins), but the 
Niners-Rams-December-Monday-Night Game is usually a 
good one. Its decided the divi
sion champion more than once. 
And always, somehow, the 
Niners have pulled out the vic
tory, and won the division, con
ference, and Super Bowl. Not to 
be this year. The ftams have 
nothing to lose, while the Niners 
could feasibly steal a wildcard 
spot from Atlanta. The Niners 
need a win. The Rams want one. 
Rams 31, Niners 24.
Thursday, we will feast in front 
of the television, taking in some 
of the best and worst in the NFL
classified
this year. Detroit, as usual, hosts 
a game for Thanksgiving. Usu
ally, the game is just a holiday 
filler. This year, however, De
troit is a playoff contender play
ing its division leader. The Chi
cago Bears have a two-game lead 
over the Lions, but have some 
problems playing in domes. Li
ons 34, Bears 21.
The other traditional Thanks
giving team, Dallas, hosts the 
lowly Pittsburgh Steelers for the 
post-feast game. Dallas needs 
every win it can get. This ones a 
gimme. Cowboys 35, Steelers 10.
On Sunday: the Atlanta Fal
cons to hold their position with a 
win over Green Bay, the Giants 
over Cincinnati, the Raiders over 
the pitiful Chargers, the Bills 
over the Jets in what could turn 
into an upset if the Bills dont 
play well enough, Kansas City 
over Seattle, New Orleans to 
clinch its first division title over 
San Francisco, Denver over the 
Patriots, Miami over the Bucca
neers, Cleveland to beat India
napolis. And lastly, Washington 
over the Rams in what might be 
that one game that the Redskins 
dont show up for. But, at this 
point, every game for the 
Redskins has that potential.
Have a happy Thanksgiving, 
and be sure to root for the Lions 
and Steelers while youre 
munching on your turkey.

The more things change ..
The South Side doesn't fit easily into any kind 
of classification. It's full of the kind of unconven
tional shops, restaurants, and bars to which 
students seem to flock. It's also nostalgic in a 
number of ways ... most of the store owners who 
appear in this issue's articles describe the South 
Side as a neighborhood where, according to 
Canoe Pittsburgh owner Tom Gelzhiser, "people 
drop in just to say 'Hello.' " In the same area 
where the young and hip go to the Beehive 
South Side to get a cup of cappuccino, there are 
churches and buildings, like the Oliver Bath 
House and the Brashear Association and Mu
seum, that are reminiscent of Pittsburgh's past. 
The past and the present seem to occur at the 
same time on the South Side and, as unlikely as 
it may seem, they compliment each other.
One view of the past & present 
According to the South Side Local Develop
ment Company (SSLDC), the South Side was 
once a group of communities outside the city of
Pittsburgh: Birmingham, East Birmingham, 
Ormsby, South Pittsburgh, and Monongahela. 
These smaller areas were annexed to Pittsburgh 
in 1872.
Like Pittsburgh's dependence upon the steel 
industry, the South Side's early economy cen
tered on industry and manufacturing. The South 
Side, again like Pittsburgh, also saw a decline in 
its industrial productivity in later years due to 
the decline of the steel industry.
Organizations like the South Side Chamber of 
Commerce, established in 1949, and the South 
Side Local Development Company, established 
in 1976, have been working to stimulate the 
South Side's economy while keeping its historic 
atmosphere. Michelle Smith, the SSLDC's direc
tor of community relations, described the 
SSLDC as starting and facilitating "economic 
development, promotion, and historical preser
vation within the South Side."

the more they stay the same
if one of the companies he serves needs some
thing in the middle of the night, he runs right 
across the street and gets to work. "You can go 
to college, learn how to do something," said 
Moros, "but when you want to do [what you've 
learned], the interest's got to be there."
Moros feels as strongly about the South Side as 
he does about his nostalgic work ethic. "I ran 
for Magistrate 12 or 15 years ago," he said. "Lost 
by three votes." Moros believes that "people can 
make the change"; when people work together, 
great things can happen.
The South Side might seem to contradict itself, 
with its progressive stores standing right next to 
the neighborhood store that has been in business 
since the years before the area's economic re
birth. But they all fit together  the neon and 
painted signs, the colorful facades, and the 
storefronts that haven't changed in years. The 
past and the present seem to agree on the idea of 
positive progress and move forward toward a 
future which will probably, in many ways, 
resemble the past.
by Alison Green 
Tartan Magazine Editor
Another aspect of the past & present
Joseph Moros, who is 49 and the owner of 
Chocolate Universe, has always lived and 
worked on the South Side. "I've been in the 
chocolate business since I was fourteen," said 
Moros. He is an amicable man who can talk at 
length about anything from chocolate 
to politics. He is as much a part of the 
past and present of the South Side as it 
is a part of him.
Moros takes a great deal of pride in 
the work he does. "I wouldn't do it if I

verse offers classes in cakeand candymaking and even had its own newslet

existence for 15 years, and ships candy

most widely known program, began in 1985 
when the 18-block business section of the South 
Side (on East Carson Street) was chosen to be a 
part of the National Main Street Center's Urban 
Demonstration Project.
Because of efforts made through the Main 
Street on East Carson program to improve the 
local economy, between 1985 and 1990 the South 
Side experienced a lot of growth. For instance, 
110 new businesses came to the South Side. 
Although 52 businesses closed, 28 businesses 
expanded. In addition, there have been 131 
facade renovations and 64 building renovation 
projects.
The South Side continues to be a growing area 
of Pittsburgh, changing as much as it stays the 
same. Alongside the new businesses forging the 
economic outlook of the South Side are the older 
businesses that have a traditional view of work 
ethics, like Chocolate Universe.
In the same 
area where the 
young and hip 
go to the Bee

to get a cup of 
cappuccino, 
there are 
churches and 
buildings that 
are reminiscent 
of Pittsburghs 
past.

Beehive offers unusual nectar
Located on the 
corner of 14th 
and East 
Carson streets, 
the Beehive 
South Side is 
Pittsburghs 
first coffee
house.
For those of you looking for an interesting 
place to go on the weekends (or during the week 
for that matter), the Beehive South Side is cer
tainly a refreshing alternative. Located on the 
comer of 14th and East Carson streets, the Bee
hive South Side is Pittsburgh's first coffeehouse. 
It offers fifteen types of coffee, fifteen types of 
tea, various cappuccinos and espressos, fresh 
juices and hot or cold cider. There are also 
cheesecakes and cakes to choose from. The 
beverages and desserts are served in an ex
tremely relaxing atmosphere featuring old tables 
and comfortable couches.
The Beehive South Side is not, however, just a 
place to order good food. There are poetry
readings every other Thursday night, artwork is 
always on display, and inevitably, there is music 
playing. Loose teas (forget the tea bag), wholebean coffees by the bag, shirts, mugs, and coffee 
paraphernalia such as filters and pots are for 
sale. Although it only opened in February 1991, 
the Beehive already enjoys a large crowd of 
customers. Manager Marla Misch describes the 
Beehive South Side as a "very liberal, openminded place."
"There is no one certain type of customer," she 
says, "We attract a mixed crowd." Students from 
various area high schools and colleges as well as 
older people, young children with their parents, 
and even yuppies frequent the Beehive. The 
relaxed servers and other employees add to the 
comfortable atmosphere. The Beehive South 
Side is open 24 hours on the weekends, and 
from 7 am to 3 am during the week.
In addition to the Beehive South Side, a new 
Beehive has just opened in Oakland. Located in 
the renovated King's Court Theater, the Beehive 
Big Screen offers everything that the Beehive 
South Side offers. The Beehive Big Screen shows 
second and third non movies, cult classics, old 
TV and cartoon reruns  simply, says Misch, 
"anything but first run films." Movie patrons 
can enjoy soda and popcorn, and can sit in either 
standard theater chairs or in couches and more 
comfortable chairs. The new Beehive features 
two coffee bars, along with a cereal bar, deli
cious peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, and 
other light foods. There is a separate "study 
room," a quiet place with comfortable couches 
and chairs and a jukebox with only lighter 
selections. There is also a small stage for acoustic 
performers, and an area for larger bands.
Another Beehive is coming to Shadyside, at the 
City Theater at 13th and Bingham streets. This 
will consist mainly of a coffee bar and pastries 
for patrons of the theater. No matter which 
Beehive you visit, you can expect an interesting 
atmosphere ... and of course, a lot of coffee.

Do you canoe?
Five sailing flags hang above the door and 
window of Canoe Pittsburgh. Through the 
window, past the neon sign, people passing by 
can see the large, colorful, and smooth forms of 
the canoes and kayaks that are on display in the 
store.
Chances are, people who have never set foot in 
a kayak or canoe will see a store full of boats 
that look more or less the same. Canoeing and 
kayaking enthusiasts will see something differ
ent. To the experienced eye, the store is a myriad 
of sleek designs and boating possibilities. Either 
way, the effect is striking.
The owner of the store, Tom Gelzhiser, can see 
all of the subtle differences in the canoes and 
kayaks. "The most important thing about the 
boats is naval architecture," said Gelzhiser.
"They're not just boats with pointy ends."
Aside from being one of the more eccentric 
stores on the South Side, Canoe Pittsburgh is the 
only store in the city that carries canoes and 
kayaks, and all of the canoeing and kayaking 
equipment a novice or expert might need. Canoe 
Pittsburgh is also very involved with the canoe 
races of the annual Pittsburgh Regatta. "For [as 
long as] we've been in business, there's been a 
canoe race in the regatta," said Gelzhiser. "I've 
been [organizing] it for the past five years."
In addition, Canoe Pittsburgh has been in
volved in You Can Canoe Day in early June, 
which takes place at the Rowing Club about 
three miles up the Allegheny River from the 
Point. According to Gelzhiser, about 150 people 
come to the event each year to try their hand at 
canoeing.
"It's the kind of thing a student could do," said 
Gelzhiser. Gelzhiser, an avid canoeing and 
kayaking man himself, talked with a gleam in 
his eye about getting people addicted to the 
sport. Canoeing and kayaking are more than his 
bread and butter. They are a philosophy of life 
that he has embraced.
A little over five years ago, Gelzhiser was 
working in the banking business, and was 
"constantly stressed." At the time, he had been 
canoeing for about eight or nine years; it was 
one of the things that gave him a sense of peace.
Then, in what Gelzhiser ironically describes as
EeT-i Aonnt/brglBt vetw-nm Me)Vim tont -bntofi -k nli tn-ri eTf Oenwlit pi-pVi g/Iy
one of the best things that has happened to him, 
his job was eliminated. "I got severance pay," 
said Gelzhiser. "I thought to myself, 1 want to 
do something different.' So here I am."
The notion of starting a specialty store for 
canoeing and kayaking equipment was a risk 
that Gelzhiser felt was worth taking. "Nobody 
[in the area] was doing it, and I saw a need," he 
said. It was rough going at first. "For the first 
year and a half or so, [the store] was only open a 
couple of nights a week," he said. Eventually, 
Canoe Pittsburgh caught on and the store is 
doing well. "It was a matter of circumstance, 
being able to do it," said Gelzhiser, "being in the 
right place at the right time."
The store used to be a stable, so there's a lot of 
room for the canoes inside, and the hayloft 
above the ceiling houses even more canoes. 
Because of the advantages of the architecture of 
the store and the affordability of the property, 
Canoe Pittsburgh "could only have worked on
It was a matter 
of circumstance, 
being able to do 
it, being in the 
right place at 
the right time.

(Almost) the cosmos is at St. Elmos
The slogan of St. Elmo's Bookstore, 
located at 2214 East Carson Street, is 
"Expect the Unexpected." Everything 
that you would expect to find at a 
New Age bookstore is there. But Bill 
Nist, the owner of St. Elmo's, insists 
that the store is not New Age. "We 
purge the term TSIew Age' from our 
bookstore," he said. No matter how 
you classify it, St. Elmo's carries 
books on almost every subject head
ing of which a reader could possibly 
conceive.
All of the usual categories are at the 
bookstore, such as Biography, Classic 
Fiction, and Travel. The topical range 
of St. Elmo's inventory reaches far 
beyond that point, however. Some of 
the other subject headings with which 
St. Elmo's organizes its inventory 
include Native American Studies;
Myth, Dreams, Jung; Religious Skepti
cism; and Western Spirituality. 'Top
ics come and go," said Nist. "We 
increase and decrease [the sizes of our 
sections] according to whether or not 
people are interested."
St. Elmo's offers a few sections 
which are unique in focus. It has AIDS 
Related, Gay/Lesbian, and Recovery sections, 
categories of books which would ordinarily be 
difficult to find in a mainstream bookstore. The 
Recovery section, in Nist's words, "covers recov
ery from addictions and dependencies." Nist 
went on to say, "[St. Elmo's is] the first book
store in Pittsburgh to recognize [Recovery] as a 
topic. We're probably the only store with an 
AIDS section."
According to Nist and Miriam Imblum, who is 
the assistant manager of St. Elmo's, the subjects 
that have attracted the most attention in the past 
year include Gender Studies, Native American 
History, Native American Spirituality, Men's 
Studies, and Women's Spirituality. "The Native 
American section started with one shelf," said 
Nist, "and now it [occupies] five." Two of the 
new sections which have just been created are
WliVait -k /--,t e/-bn e bToairti -k tb/iwnt VeI /iI-Tf nlot oTT-wiTn9V--,oTg tn-rikr-Tny
Divination Systems and Spiritual Technologies, 
and Magical Religions. Nist said that the title of 
the first section "should keep people guessing." 
St. Elmo's has been keeping people guessing for 
four and a half years, since it first opened.
How did Nist conceive of the alternative 
bookstore? "I needed a job," Nist said, smiling.
"I was in the religious life, and when I left it, I 
didn't have anything to do, so I thought [start
ing] a hip bookstore was the thing to do."
The South Side seemed to Nist, in his words, 
to be "a reasonable location." Nist went on to 
say that "bookstores have a hard time making it, 
especially alternative bookstores." Rent is inex
pensive, and the location is not too far from the 
universities which supply a great deal of his 
customers. Nist even lives on the South Side. "I

Welcome to cinemas golden age
If it weren't for the nostalgic marquee and 
ticket window outside the small theater, the Rex 
might just blend into East Carson street. The Rex 
hasn't completely escaped the public eye, 
though; this year, it won both the Pittsburgh 
Magazine and In Pittsburgh awards for Best 
Theater. In more ways than one, there is more to 
the Rex than meets the eye.
According to David Bevilacqua, who oversees 
operations at the Rex and whose family owns 
the theater, the Rex is the oldest operating the
ater in Pittsburgh. "It was built in 1905," said 
Bevilacqua. "We remodeled the theater and 
reopened in 1989."
The Rex continues to have a nostalgic atmo
sphere outside and inside; for instance, ticket 
vendors really do sell the tickets from the out
side ticket window. "There are two or three 
weeks out of the year when we sell inside, 
because it's too cold," said Bevilacqua. "Other
wise, the tickets are sold outside."
In the summer, the Rex's concession stand 
offers moviegoers fresh iced tea. The theater 
even has a private balcony that seats ten.
The Rex has all of the amenities, including a 
Dolby SR system and comfortable, wide seats. 
"We're the best; the people voted on that," said 
Bevilacqua. According to him, the atmosphere 
and the range of movies shown at the Rex attract 
a wide variety of people. He believes that it 
makes the theater even more interesting. In fact, 
the Rex even enjoys a reputation among those 
who have, in Bevilacqua's words, "experienced 
the Rex." He said that "a lot of people come just 
because it's the Rex."
November is Rock Month at the Rex, the 
theater's most popular theme. According to 
Bevilacqua, the theater is currently averaging 
about 150 people a night on Fridays and Satur
days. The selection of movies that were shown 
at the Rex earlier this month runs the gamut 
from recently released movies such as The Com
mitments and Truth or Dare to older movies like 
This Is Spinal Tap, The Wall, and Purple Rain.
For the weekend beginning with and including 
Thanksgiving, the Rex will show the film Heavy
Metal at midnight. Bevilacqua described the 
screening of the movie as a "Thanksgiving 
tradition." If this year's turnout is the same as 
last year's, all 240 seats will be filled for each 
showing.
Although the Rex might not enjoy the kind of 
attention among CMU students that other South 
Side attractions like the Beehive get, the theater 
is well known for its historic aspects as well as 
its modem features. The next time you feel like 
going to a movie, think about heading for the 
Rex. Besides, admission is only three dollars. 
That would leave you enough change after
wards to go down to the Beehive and get a 
coffee.
The Rex 
enjoys a 
reputation 
among those 
who have, in 
owner David 
Bevilacquas 
words, 
experienced 
the Rex.

Look into Z
The Studio Z Gallery was founded 12 years 
ago by Kathleen Cochran Zimbicki, a profes
sional artist and the sole owner of the gallery. 
The gallery houses almost every type of art 
(although most of it is Contemporary) in a 
variety of forms: photographs, paintings, draw
ings, and sculptures, among others.
The current exhibit is called "3 at Z"; the show 
includes works by Stanley Swartz (abstracts), 
Marian Graper (paintings), and Kathy Kidney 
(drawings).

live six blocks away. I've tried to move closer, 
but there's no way," Nist said jokingly.
Like Nist, Imblum enjoys the location and the 
trends that St. Elmo's has seen come and go over 
time. Among the things that Imblum has en
joyed most about St. Elmo's over the years is the 
kind of readers that the store attracts. "I think 
it's important to say that we have excellent
customers," said Imblum, "people challenged to 
be avid readers ... and challenged to be interac
tive." Nist added, "We think we're mutually 
enriching."

the South Side," said Gelzhiser. He finds that the 
people he meets through the store are friendly, 
and that people often "drop in just to say 
'Hello.'" Gelzhiser said that now he can be 
much more relaxed than he was with his former 
job. Now he can devote himself to his love for 
canoeing.
"It seems like the more you do it, the more you 
realize that you need to learn even more," 
Gelzhiser said about canoeing. Once a person
begins the sport, he or she becomes devoted to 
it. "If a person were on a budget and wanted 
recreation, it's well worth [the cost of] a canoe," 
said Gelzhiser. "Once you have the boat, you 
can use it [over and over] at little cost. It's a 
lifetime sport." And if Gelzhiser has his way, 
he'll be doing it until he's about 90.

One sports saloon is not enough
Along the long stretch of eateries on East 
Carson street in the South Side of Pittsburgh lie 
two restaurant/bars which have combined 
ambiance with good food and drink in one big 
building. Constructed in what used to be a 
clothing store, Mario's and Blue Lou's are sports 
saloons that provide unique and delicious Ital
ian meals along with the night life of a typical 
bar.
However, neither restaurant is ordinary. Both 
look like an old-fashioned western saloon while 
keeping the atmosphere of a sports bar. Mario's 
and Blue Lou's have remodeled antique bars 
with brass spittoons containing fresh bar snacks. 
Both restuarants serve Italian food prepared 
with a unique old-fashioned western flair. Garlic 
bread is served in lined miniature, steel pails. 
Drinks are served in old jars with long, 
uncooked noodles serving as straws.
Both have modem, yet nostalgic features. For 
instance, the sports saloons share a brick wall 
reminiscent of the old-fashioned pubs of the 
past century. Among the modem nostalgic 
touches of Mario's and Blue Lou's are the over
head fans in both restaurants, and the oldfashioned jukebox in Blue Lou's. The back stairs 
and upper levels of both restaurants have been 
left as they were originally built.
The restaurants are also sports bars which 
commemorate local historical sports' events. The 
walls are decked with old, framed newspaper 
clippings, magazine covers, and photographs of 
Pittsburgh sports heroes. Of the two saloons, 
Mario's has an especially sporty look to it. The 
wall above the bar has three stained glass win
dows showing the logos of Pittsburgh's three 
main sports teams  the Steelers, the Pirates, 
and the Penguins  as well as the years in 
which the teams were section and national 
champions.
Blue Lou's has a few special added features 
that are especially popular among its customers. 
Running up through several floors is a fireman's 
pole. The pole is used for celebrations. The 
server slides down this pole and past the party 
to the lower floor carrying a dessert chosen by 
the guest of honor. The server then comes back
up to the party's floor to deliver the dessert.
Blue Lou's also offers a variety of specialty 
drinks, including half-yards and yards of beer. 
Anyone who manages to drink a hundred yards 
of beer (you get a scorecard) scores a touch
down. Blue Lou's also serves beer in a fishbowl, 
and true to the name, any drink you order will 
be colored blue. Both Mario's and Blue Lou's 
serve margaritas made from a special blend 
made in the restaurants. The only difference? If 
you order it in Blue Lou's, the margarita will be 
blue.
Blue Lou's and Mario's are located at 1510 and 
1514 East Carson street, respectively. The restau
rants provide double the food, double the room, 
double the drinks, and double the fun. In this 
case, two are definitely better than one.

The Fines are friends of the family; our Fine friends I like to call them. Since 
our first encounter back in 1978, they have provided a constant topic of conver
sation in my house. It seems every time one of us blinks, the Fines have com
pleted yet another radical change the latest metamorphosis resembling some
thing like a changing of the guard. Unbeknownst to Mr. Fine, his raspy, glit
tery, More cigarette-smoking wife hired a 57 year old house-painter named 
Angelo to touch up the hallways and ceilings in their retro 70s love-den. (This 
is the house to visit for reliving the sticky decor of black-velvet tiger paintings 
and afghans draped over hairy couches.) Seven months after being hired, the 
painting still not finished, Angelo moved in with the Fines, making a room for 
himself in their cluttered basement. Soon after, Mrs. Fine and Angelo started to 
sneak out together in disguises, really lousy ones. Out of my family, I was the 
only one who consistently ran into them, usually at the supermarket or mall, 
catching a glimpse of Mrs. Fines olive skin clashing with her blond wig and 
little wrinkled Angelo so out of character in a fire-red velour jogging suit. They 
would even occasionally speak in thick accents at checkout counters for further 
confusion. I would report these sightings to my family at the dinner table, but 
of course, never disclosed the information to Mr. Fine. Eventually Angelo and 
Mrs. Fine ran off together to live in her getaway cabin in the Blue Ridge Moun
tains. Within a year, Mr. Fine had found a new and improved Mrs. Fine to fill 
the shoes of his ex: a tiny, grey-haired mouse of a lady with lacquered red nails 
and a laugh nasal enough to curdle milk. These days, both couples are very 
content in their new worlds; what strikes me as interesting is how people can 
live two lives: seen through both their own eyes and through others.

The Philosopher At Large: 
Truth Engineer
Tom Price
There was this pretty little girl who looked 
like she came from a family with money and she 
asked me to come up with an epistemology for her.
She was sitting in the chair in front of my 
desk, put a big check in front of me and told me 
her story. Her belief system had recently been 
challenged pretty powerfully and she never 
wanted that to happen again. She wanted a brand 
new bulletproof low-maintenance reality, or 
worldview as its sometimes called. No more 
uncertainty in her life: every phenomenon must be 
explicable in a consistent fashion. No matter what 
it might be, from particle physics to the operation 
of laundry detergent on her summer whites, this 
new worldview had to explain all of it. Little did 
she know that such rigid requirements are often 
the easiest to satisfy.
I said, Lets just assign everything we dont 
understand to the realm of the supernatural. 
Demons. Demons get your clothes clean.
She looked like she was about to cry.
Come come, I said. Prove to me that 
demons dont get your clothes clean!
She thought about it for a minute and 
changed her mind about crying. Hey, yeah, she 
said. That really works! Then she paused.
Now where do I fit into all of this? Id really be 
frightened if I didnt have some feeling of 
connectedness to this supernatural realm.
I thought for a minute or two and said, 
Youd like this to be simple and sweeping, so the 
first things were going to do is anthropomorphize 
the universe.
Beg pardon? she said.
Anthropomorphize you know, treat as if 
human: treat everything in the Universe as if it 
were the result of some conscious act of will, as if 
it were some agency which acted on the basis of 
feelings much like humans feelings, I said.
Can we do that? she asked.
Piece of cake, I said, were not even into 
the realm of true or false yet. Were still just 
making the arbitrary initial decisions about how 
we are going to enable ourselves to handle the 
concepts which will structure our reality. Its sort 
of like were choosing what language were going 
to speak. Were choosing one which is very vivid 
and which represents the actions of things in a 
way which is very similar to the way we ourselves 
act: this will make it easier to understand.
Okay, she said.
Now, I said, settling back into my chair 
and swinging my feet up onto the edge of my desk, 
well want to make this very simple, so well 
make it have only two fundamental elements:
Good and Evil. Weve chosen these elements to be 
antagonistic to one another the notion of a 
battle between nearly equally matched sides will 
make our reality even more vivid and engaging, 
and easier to get caught up in. It will appeal to 
our competitive and partisan instincts. Having 
said all this, we are ready to state the essential core 
of our easy-to-adopt worldview: all of reality is a 
battle between Good and the Forces of Good, and 
Evil and the Forces of Evil. Very simple, binary, 
black and white, and at the same time, very 
exciting. Everything you experience can be

---------------------------------------------------

interpreted in these terms. If you like it, if its 
good for you or good in your opinion, then it must 
be part of the plan of the Forces of Good. If you 
dont like it, or if its bad in your opinion or if it 
hurts you in some way, then it must be part of the 
Forces of Evil.
She had grown very excited at this and sat 
up on the edge of her seat. Mr. Philosopher-atLarge, I am very happy with this. But I can see 
one problem: how do I deal with people who 
challenge this worldview? How do I deal with any 
evidence that seems to contradict this worldview?
Smiling shrewdly, I pulled my Socratic 
Method out of its holster and aimed it at the mark 
shed just created. That contradictory evidence 
would make you unhappy, wouldnt it? You dont 
like having your belief system questk aed, do you? 
So what does that say about the contradictory 
evidence?
She jumped out of her chair, laughing with 
delight. Why, it would mean that the 
contradictory evidence was obviously engineered 
by the forces of evil! Mr. Philosopher-at-Large, I 
dont know how to repay you! This belief system 
is absolutely unassailable! Never again will I be 
frightened by questions about my beliefs! Oh, 
thank you, thank you!
There was nothing left but paperwork (tax 
purposes) and then I escorted her to the door.
As I came back in, Dillworth, the CPA whose 
suite I sublet my own office from, was cleaning 
coffee grounds out of the coffee machine we both 
use. I was eavesdropping, he said, and I 
noticed one flaw in your little scheme.
And whats that? I asked.
This forces-of-Good/forces-of-Evil business 
sounds theistic. But your scheme as propounded is 
positively atheistic.
How so? I asked.
Well, he said, the strong implication is 
that one was created by the forces-of-Good, since 
everything that pleases you is their work, too; that 
strongly implies an intelligent designer. 
Right, I said.
 If reality is the way you just convinced that 
girl that it is, then we would all have been given 
brains the size of baboons brains, since thats all 
the more we would need to understand things 
with. But we werent, and as a consequence I infer 
that either we arent the work of an intelligent 
designer, of else maybe the world is a complex 
place after all.
Your cynicism, I said, pointing my finger 
at him, is Evil, Maybe even demoniacal.
He chuckled to himself as he strode back 
into his office, sipping his coffee.
A couple of days passed. It was winter, 
always a slow time for a philosopher Descartes 
died of pneumonia in Sweden in the winter, you 
recall its just as easy to get depressed when the 
sun doesnt shine (which fact gives the lie to 
Descartes conception of man as essentially 
rational, by the way) and I was reading Barbara 
Cartland novel (having make a bet with Dillworth 
that I could finish the whole thing in less than 
ninety minutes) when there was a knock at the 
door. I paused the stopwatch. Come in! I 
shouted.

---------------------------------------------------

I could tell from his features that he was the 
girls father. I motioned him into the chair in front 
of my desk and ditched the novel into my cookie 
drawer. And how may I help you? I asked 
warily, folding my hands politely on the desk in 
front of me and sliding the drawer shut with my 
knee.
ill come right to the point. That 
epistemology you worked out for my daughter was 
just a bang-up job, I thought, and I was 
considering adopting it myself, he said.
Oh really? I said.
Yes, really. But the problem is that it seems 
a bit... you know, ad hoc, he said.
Ad hoc? I said.
Yes, ad hoc, he said. You know, you wait 
for things to happen and then you sort of paste 
your understanding on top of them, sorting events 
into a Good pile and an Evil pile.
|Suits some people, I said.
Right, well... I m a businessman, Mr. 
Philosopher-at-Large, a very busy and important 
man. A man like me needs an impressive belief 
system. Could you doll up the epistemology you 
gave my daughter with some bells and whistles? 
Make it suitable for belittling other people with? I 
want a whole cosmology so that I can talk about it 
at dinner parties and things. This waiting for 
events to happen and then understanding them 
afterwards is fine for some people, but not for 
me.
Well, I...
Money is no object, of course.
I swung my feet up onto my desk again and
rubbed my chin. Bells and whistles. Hmm. 
Okay, I said. Since everything is supernatural 
anyway, we might as well go hog-wild and claim 
that all the visible, known, and material universe 
was created last Thursday by the forces of Good 
including all evidence that it has existed for any 
longer than that. Call it Last-Thursdayism. You 
can tell people youre a Last-Thursdayist, hint 
broadly that its sort of mystical even.
Mystical? he asked, blinking.
Right, I said. What happens next 
Thursday?
Uhh... the world comes to an end?
Close enough, I said. There is no future, 
there is only now. Or, at least, only this last 
week.
I dont think I get it, he said.
Pay close attention, I said. Everything 
was created on the most recent Thursday, right?
So we cant really get past next Thursday, because 
Thursday is never next to anything; its always 
the brand new starting point. So its like living the 
same week over and over again.
Cool! he said.
Of course, I said, the idea of living it over 
and over again is just an illusion.
He had gotten up and begun to pace around 
the room. Right... right... I must say thats 
mighty impressive! Of course I wont be needing 
this mysticism angle so much myself... can you get 
me an ethical system to go with it? Thats what I 
really need: an ethical system. That way I can feel 
self-righteous.
That was a rather sudden and unexpected
Warm Fuziyism, LastTIiursdayi*

---------------------------------------------------

request. Ethical system? I asked.
Right, he said. One that is clearly 
derived from the terms of the Last-Thursdayist 
universe.
Mmmmmm... I began to drum my 
fingertips on my desktop. Then I stopped.
Minutes passed. I guess Ill need a few days to 
think that one over, I said. He looked crestfallen. 
But Ill do my best, I said. Tell you what, Ill 
phone you as soon as I come up with it. We 
traded business cards and I showed him out.
Early the next morning when I came in my 
9:15 appointment was waiting for me. A young 
woman, college-age, apparently mixed up in some 
sort of politics I didnt really care to know too 
much. I am convinced that the role of members 
of a free society is to distribute esteem equally, 
she said.
Uh-huh, I said.
Because if one distributes esteem 
unequally, she said, then that means one is 
making distinctions. And distinctions lead to 
unequal treatment. And unequal treatment leads 
to oppression.
Uh-uh, I said. She looked at me for a 
second.
And oppression is bad, she explained. 
Oh, I said. There was a short awkward 
pause. So what do you need me for? It sounds 
as if youve got a good grip on the situation as I 
understand it.
Well, I think so, she said, but I have the 
most awful time convincing people of this 
viewpoint! Especially political science majors. 
Not surprising, I mused. Theyll have the
background to see the weakness in your ideas.
You are requiring an epistemological behavior as a 
precondition of participation in a free society. 
Thought control, in other words: everyone must 
esteem things equally or think the same of things. 
The older, more orthodox view was that civil 
behaviors could be required as a precondition of 
participation in a free society: that is, all members 
were to be secure in their persons and livelihoods, 
and no other members could infringe upon that 
security. But people were expected to disagree, 
perhaps sharply; it was expected that there would 
be a variety of epistemological behaviors. In fact, 
the whole point of a free society is that it 
encourages a variety of epistemological 
behaviors.
So you disagree with me, she snapped.
Oh, no, Im completely objective, I said.
Its a living. Im just trying to put your situation 
in context. Okay, look at it this way: youll never 
beat anyone in a fair, rational discussion. Your 
position is backwards at root; you said that if one 
distributes esteem unequally, then one is making 
distinctions. Its the other way around: if one 
makes distinctions, then one will distribute esteem 
unequally.
So what causes one to make distinctions? 
she asked.
Thinking, I said. She scowled at the floor.
So you want to be able to convince people, 
but you wont manage it rationally, I said.
Youre going to have to fall back on more 
rhetorical artifices. Try intimidation. Try ad 
hominem attacks; accuse those who disagree with 
you of being oppressive themselves.

---------------------------------------------------

That doesnt sound very easy, she said.
Its not really that hard, I said. 
Intimidation is as easy as learning jargon. Here 
let me see if I still have my flash cards. I rose 
and began to rummage in the storage closet. 
Theyre around here somewhere, I said. Each 
phrase is specially contrived to be more or less 
euphonious, so it doesnt matter if its relevant to 
the conversation or not. Ah! Here they are. I 
emerged and sat back down behind my desk, 
selecting what I thought to be the most 
appropriate set. Here, try the first one.
I held it up and she squinted at it, and then 
began to read it, hesitantly: Eurocentrist 
heteropolitico...
Thats just fine, I said, encouraging her. 
The first lot is just terms, intended to get you 
comfortable enough with them to drop them into 
sentences without even thinking about them.
After that theres a section of denunciations, and 
the last group are accusations in complete sentence 
form.
So we worked through those, and I saw her 
off, and the day was shot. I was about to go home 
and water my plants when something that the girl 
had said connected with my need for an ethical 
system to go with Last-Thursdayism.
Last-Thursdayism is really just a silly facade 
for solipsism everything is just a fantasy, you 
might as well be a brain in a vat hooked up to 
electrodes feeding you a picture show except of 
course you claim that the picture show is directed 
by the Forces of Good. Of course, theres no way 
to verify this. Since you are admitting that 
absolutely everything you experience is rigged,
how can you get any knowledge at all about whos 
rigging it? But if everything is rigged, then theres 
no point in making distinctions, since the 
distinctions dont really correspond to anything 
significant. So you should distribute esteem 
uniformly. Dont think, dont make distinctions. 
Just be nice. Just sit around and like everything. 
Warm Fuzzyism. Yeah, thats perfect. You could 
sell a lot of people on it. All you need to do is like 
everything. Warm Fuzzyism. Perfect.
I called the girls father and had him come to 
the office and explained his new ethical system to 
him. Then we filled out some forms (tax 
purposes) and that was it. Case closed.
EPILOGUE
Later that night found me at the bar of my 
favorite club, the Observation Pit, listening to an 
up-and-coming rock band (the Refrigerator 
Grunt), when one of my colleagues in the free
lance philosophy trade sidled up and offered to 
buy me the beverage of my choice.
Tomato juice, I said, smiling. He sat down 
next to me. Whence this boon? I asked.
Word of how you solved that latest case of 
yours is all over town, he said. LastThursdayism/Warm-Fuzzyism. Thats just 
beautiful. You took some dangerous tendencies in 
theology and some back-constructed justifications 
for popular political tendencies and turned them 
into a consistent world-view. Slick! 
Well, I smiled, sipping my tomato juice, It 
worked for Emperor Constantine, didnt it?

In Search of Perfection
Joe Tebelskis
A crystal sphere caught the light of its display case 
And cast me under its spell.
Emerald green globe!
Gleaming, glittering glass,
Lens and mirror of the universe,
Avatar of Perfection:
I had to have it.
Joyfully I brought it home 
And carefully displayed it 
Where it caught the light of the day.
It was so perfect
That when I gazed into its face
It blinded me.
It was so perfect 
That I feared to touch it.
The numinous orb, surely divine,
Was too perfect for this world.
My greasy fingers, my profane palms 
Gould only defile it.
And so for years it remained
Venerably mounted on its pedestal: enshrined,
Quarantined,
Gathering dust and soot 
Until I no longer noticed it,
A god consigned to oblivion.
Then one night, as I lay awake,
I suddenly heard it calling to me,
Crying to be held,
To be clasped by my imperfect hands.
At last I arose in the darkness
And sinfully seized the untouchable thing.
And as I smothered it with fingerprints, 
Rediscovering that it was hard and real,
Something perfect emerged from its depths
And said: Worshiper! At last
We are engaged. Never forget and never fear:
I can be known but not effaced 
By your searching hand.

Alumnus Billy Porter hits Broadway
By HEIDI HOOVER
Tartan Managing Editor 
& MICHAEL T. ROSE
Special to The Tartan
November, 1990: W. Ellis Porter, se
nior, makes front-page news as he is 
cast in the original Broadway company 
ofMss Saigon. Porter spends his final 
semester rehearsing in New York and 
graduates with his class in May.
July, 1991: The audience in the clnb, 
called DontTelllMama, fifty-seat back 
room is beyond enthusiastic, way be
yond. Nobody told them that the crowds 
at AIDS benefits were supposed to be 
subdued. That young man, the cabaret 
singer, hes got something; hes got soul, 
faith you can feel, a power in his voice 
that lifts you out of your seat. Every
body in the room knows it.
And then Billy Porter smiles, and the 
mood in the room is lifted another-few 
notches.
I feel like I do have a gift of song, he 
later says, and if I can share that with 
someone to ease, to healwhatever it 
takes ... thats what I have to offer.
Equity Fights AIDS
At ease in his shared dressing room 
st the Broadway Theatre, Porter  
wearing a burgundy Miss Saigon bath
robe with W. Ellis embroidered on the 
breastcomes across justashedidon 
stage. He is vibrant and energetic, and 
seems unconcerned with the perfor
mance that lies ahead that evening. In 
feet, to hear Porter tell it, Broadway 
has become routine, and hes looking 
for more.
B Its a job, he says matter-of-factly. 
I Wont He; its a job. But its a good job, 
its a job that I enjoy doing. No, I 
>at want to stay here much longer, 
but its ah incredible job.
Porters benefit cabaret, aprojectthat 
supported Actors Equity Fights AIDS 
ecause hes always wanted to do some
thing for Equity Fights AIDS, had just 
een completed when he was interlewed by The Tartan last summer, 
the idea of AIDS became real to Porerwhen I started having friends with 
and my friends started dying.
Then Jim McCrum, a good friend of 
Porters from Pittsburgh theater, got 
AIDS. Watching him deteriorate 
scared me, says Porter. The phone call 
telling him his friend had died came 
when Porter was about to send him the 
cabaret flyer.
In five Sunday-night shows over the 
course of a month, he and his band 
raised three thousand dollars for Eq
uity Fights AIDS. I wish I could have 
raised more, he says, but its good.
The fundraising may have just been 
good, but Porters cabaret, featuring 
a full band and three backup singers, 
was stunning. With his extraordinary 
voice and remarkable energy, Porter 
soared through a demanding set of pop 
and gospel tunes including pieces from 
Julia Fordham, Oleta Adams, and the 
Winans. The crowd loved it. Saigon 
star Jonathan Pryce went twice, and 
the second time he brought his wife.
Almost all the songs Porter performed 
were originally by female vocalists. He 
has a high, clear, tenor voice, and says, 
I have been resigned to the fact that I 
have a high voice.... A lot of music done 
by women I relate to emotionally so 
much more readily than I do male art
ists because its higher. I think that 
touches something in me.
Among Porters back-up singers were 
Vanita Harbour, a 1990 CMU drama 
graduate, and Lillias White, a close 
friend whom he met while understudy
ing for Romance in Hard Times in the 
summer of 1990. Last summer, White 
was performing in the cast of 
Broadways Once on this Island, and 
Harbour was understudying for the 
same show.
Porter and White were already work
ing on the cabaret when she asked him 
how he got into the acting business. He 
told her, Probably the biggest thing 
was when I was six or seven, my aunt 
took me to see The Wiz on my birthday. 
White asked where, and he told her it 
was in Pittsburgh.
He didnt know who the woman who 
played Dorothy was, but she inspired 
him. It was my inception into theater 
... and I was stunned. I sat in the chair 
after it was over for 20 minutes, just 
crying. She really, really moved me, he
says. And Im telling this to [White], 
and she starts crying, and Im like 
Whats wrong with you? and she says, 
That was me. 
The Road to Broadway
Porter, who didnt grow up rich, has 
come a long way. As an ensemble player 
in Saigon, he has the kind of money  
and the security of a steady job  that 
many artists would envy. And yet, he 
says, Im on the bottoml I still have so 
far to go.
At 15, when many kids are working 
at McDonalds or in retail stores, Porter 
spent the summer performing shows at 
Kennywood. His later work in Pitts
burgh included Chicago andDreamgirls 
at the Pittsburgh Playhouse. In Kresge 
Theatre, he appeared in the fall 1989 
production I Hear America Singing and 
in A Chorus Line and Antigone in the 
fall of 1990. Porter was slated to play 
Judas in CMU dramas production of 
Jesus Christ Superstar last spring, but 
unfortunately for Kresge audiences, he 
was already in New York at work on 
Miss Saigon.
Getting there was no mean feat, how
ever. He first auditioned in January of 
1990, a full year before he left CMU to 
do the show. After a callback, also in 
January, he heard nothing until April, 
when the word was that Miss Saigon 
was going to happen in July.
Then Miss Saigon began having le
gal problems with Actors Equity, since 
Jonathan Pryce, a British actor, was to 
play the Eurasian pimp known as the 
Engineer. Actors Equity thought an 
Asian should play the part. Rather than 
giving in to the union, Producer 
Cameron Mackintosh cancelled the 
show. Porter found out from watching 
CNN in North Carolina, where he was 
performing in Annie. I was lost, he 
says. I was really crushed.
His options at that point were to go 
back to school or to take a part he had 
been offered with the tour of Sarafina. 
At school was the part of the chorus in 
Antigone, his first straight play, which 
hed been looking forward to because 
Id been training as a straight actor,

Its more than acting; it's living.

freshman drama major. Matt Faber
hes coming from. [He is a] sev
enteen-year-old man who finds 
an idol he wants to be like. 
Weve all done that. I can under
stand his shortcomings very 
well.
Indeed, playing Calvin is a 
consuming role for Faber. Some
times I find myself slipping [into 
Calvin]. Calvin is not a very good 
communicator. Sometimes when 
Im with people, I phase out. I 
mean I know who I am, but just 
to play around with the feeling 
of not knowing who you are is a 
good thing. It expands your 
mind.
I like movies because it 
reaches people on a broader level. 
A persons life can change just 
by watching a movie. However, 
Fabers true love is the stage. I 
like the theater best because it 
is alive. Its more active. Its more 
real. Id be happy doing both, 
though.
Right now, Faber is adapting 
to the rigors of balancing school 
and filming the movie. When 
Faber isnt on the set of Bob 
Roberts, he is engaged in the
freshman drama program. The 
movie is a major time commit
ment, so, Faber cannot partici
pate fully in the program. How
ever, he has no plans of drop
ping out of school: Faber believes 
the training is beneficial, and 
after filming has desisted (some
time after Thanksgiving), he 
plans to return to classes as 
usual. Its a lot of hard work. 
[The classes] have given me more 
of an awareness of what the ac
tor has to do and the perceptions 
an actor has to go through to 
achieve a certain state of versa
tility.
Despite the rigorous work and 
the difficult schedule, it is evi
dent that Faber loves his art. 
People take their humanity for 
granted. Some people die with
out being what they want to be. 
They just get stuck in a rut and 
cant get out. Acting is a way to 
not get stuck in a rut. Its expe
riencing things, observing things 
people readily dont see. Acting 
is such a bland term. Its more 
than acting; its living. Thats all 
it is.

I get these images in my head. 
Its hard to put into words. I 
want people to know something 
they have not yet known. To 
remind them that life is not a 
struggle. I want to be more than 
an actor. I want to do anything 
that broadens the horizons. I 
dont know what. Im eighteen. 
Sometimes I tend to forget that. 
I think like an old man.
Most eighteen-year-olds are 
still thinking about what they 
want to do. Some young people 
go to college. Matthew Faber is 
no exception; however, he is 
headed in a definitive direction. 
The eighteen-year-old Carnegie 
Mellon drama major from York, 
Pennsylvania has a role in Bob 
Roberts, a major motion picture 
directed by and starring Tim 
Robbins.
Bob Roberts is currently being 
filmed in Pittsburgh and Wash
ington, D.C. Tim Robbins plays 
a conservative, yuppie-like busi
nessman who becomes a Sena
tor. The frightening aspect is 
that deep down, Senator Bob 
Roberts is a fascist and a dicta
tor. Allusions to David Duke, 
former grand wizard of the Ku 
Klux Klan and founder of the 
National Association for the 
Advancement of White People 
and candidate in Louisianas 
gubernatorial election this year, 
are made. Faber plays Calvin, 
the boy who becomes increas
ingly obsessed with Bob Rob
erts.
Calvin is personal to me be

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  25 November 1991
A guide for the recreational speeder
Ive decided this week to 
change format a little. Instead 
of talking about life, the uni
verse, and me, Ive decided to 
talk about one of my other favor
ite topics  speeding. With 
Thanksgiving and winter break 
coming up soon, almost every
one is going to have access to a 
car again, which means almost 
everyone is going to be speeding 
down the highway again.
Oh, sure, I know that speed
ing isnt good, or even legal, but 
a lot of my friends and Iseem to 
do it anyway. Human beings just 
seem to have this affinity for 
doing dangerous things which 
we know we shouldnt be doing. 
Gambling, smoking, eatingfried 
food, building nuclear bombs, or 
speeding, humans are always 
doing something self-destructive 
and trying to get away with it. 
And as dangerous activities go, 
speeding is one of the safer and 
easier to perform and get away 
with. Its also a lot of fun.
However, as with all danger
ous things, if you get caught or 
make a mistake you must pay a 
price. In this case the price is 
usually money, a suspended li
cense, or something worse. None 
of these conjure pleasant 
thoughts, or cause most people
LIFE, THE UNIVERSE, 
AND STEVE
Mi Wdlyvlo (nfrEl/
to stop speeding.
So if youre going to speed over 
the break, you might as well do 
it as safely as possible, and make 
sure that you can get away with 
it. By following some of my per
sonal speeding tips, youll be able 
to speed with greater confidence 
and get away with it more often.
 Know how a radar gun 
works. In the war against speed
ers, a cops favorite weapon is 
the radar gun. Theyre easy to 
use, fairly reliable, and if you 
get a ticket because of one, 
theyre just about impossible to 
fight in court. These nasty little 
devices are responsible for catch
ing speeders more speeders than 
all other methods combined.
However, even with todays 
advanced technology, radar guns 
can be off by as much as 5 mph 
(in either direction) and some
times more, because of outside 
interference such as microwaves 
and telephone poles. Because of 
this minor glitch in an other
wise perfect trap, cops usually 
will only pull you over, even 
when theyre using a radar gun, 
if youre going at least 15 mph 
over the speed limit. Keep this 
in mind when youre doing 70 on 
the expressway. You might save 
yourself a lot of grief and a ticket 
by just slowing down a mph or 
two.
 Buy and use a radar detec
tor. Believe me, these things 
work, otherwise they wouldnt 
be outlawed in some states. The 
only reason they arent outlawed 
in all 50 states is because not 
everyone uses them. If everyone 
started using them, they would 
quickly become illegal.
When choosing a radar detec
tor, just about any brand will do. 
Theyre very simple pieces of 
equipment mechanically, and 
they all work under the same 
principles. Higher priced brands, 
such as Passport, Escort, Solo, 
or Legend, are usually smaller, 
lighter, look nicer, and can some
times detect radar which is far
ther away. Theyll also cost you 
as much as $400. So unless youre 
a serious speeder, I recommend
a cheap, bulky radar detector, 
which shouldnt cost you more 
than $50.
And remember to use them. I 
cant count the number of times 
Ive had friends get tickets be
cause of radar guns, while their 
radar detectors were sitting in 
the glove compartments. Keep 
it out and plugged in at all times 
and you wont ever have to bother 
with it, or those pesky tickets, 
ever again.
 Try to keep your speeding 
down to a minimum at the end of 
the month. You know that old 
story about cops giving out more 
tickets at the end of the month 
because they have to meet their 
quota? Well, believe it or not, its 
true. As a matter of fact, accord
ing to some of my police officer 
friends, cops give out up to half 
of their quota of tickets during 
the last few days of the month. 
Something to think about when 
youre speeding to your family 
reunion for Christmas dinner.
 Speed in packs. If everyone 
on the expressway is going 60 
mph and then you come along 
doing 90, that cop only has to 
worry about capturingyou. How
ever, if you and four other people 
nearby are doing 90, then that 
cop has five people to pick from.
Speedingin packs is usually easy 
to do on major highways and 
even fun. Just remember not to 
let your ego get the better of you 
by trying to race the other people 
in your pack. Theyre your pro
tection, not your competition. 
That is, unless a cop starts chas
ing you. In that case, all bets are 
off! At this point, your only con
cern is to get the hell out of there 
because that cop will usually 
catch the slowest one in the pack, 
and you dont want that to be 
you.
 If possible, slow down when
ever you see a cop. On large 
highways or busy roads, cops 
usually work in pairs to catch 
speeders. And radar guns arent 
the only weapon cops use against 
speeders. Another ever-popular 
method being used today is the 
timingmethod, in which two cops 
time the distance it takes for 
you to travel from one point to 
another and then figure out how 
fast you were going. This method 
doesnt use radar guns, only a 
stopwatch and a CB so that cops 
can communicate with each 
other.
They also work in pairs for the 
simple reason that its hard to 
catch a speeder without a good 
head start. A common ploy to
day is that one cop will call ahead 
to his partner, describe your car, 
the lane you were in, and the 
speed you were going. That sec
ond cop then pulls onto the high
way and starts looking for you. 
However, if you slow down, 
change lanes, and, if possible, 
get off the road or highway altogether, you may confuse that 
second cop who is looking for 
you. Its usually safe to start 
speeding up after youre a mile 
or two away from the first cop 
you see.
Finally, always keep in mind 
while youre zooming down the 
road that the odds are against 
you. The reality is that speeding 
itself is risky; there are cops all 
over the place, and the simple 
fact that they have the law on 
their side makes speeding a dangerous game to play. However, 
by usingyour wits, sneaky strat
egies, and a radar detector, you 
can shift the balance of power 
over to your side and make 
speeding a safer and more fun 
game to play.
Enjoy your break!

Stephen Glicker is a senior policy
& management major who has 
never received a speeding ticket.
Porter relates life after CMU
BILLY PORTER, from page LI
and then doing all these musi
cals, which was fine... but I just 
wanted to do a straight play. 
Also, he was looking forward to 
studying again with Mel 
Shapiro, who was his acting 
teacher his junior year. Sarafina 
was offering fifteen hundred 
dollars a week. Porter decided to 
stay in school.
When he returned to Carn
egie Mellon that fall, however, 
he found that "Antigone had 
turned into a musical.... Then 
Mel Shapiro decided he was leav
ing. It was a letdown, but Por
ter still didnt want to leave 
school.
In the middle of the fall se
mester, he ran out of money. He 
asked the Drama Department 
for money to finish the year, and 
was told there was none. By this 
time, Saigon had been reinstated
 Actors Equity changed its 
tune when Mackintosh cancelled 
the award-winning show  and 
Porters final audition was on a 
Sunday, the day after A Chorus 
Line closed.
At this point he had no choice 
but to leave school; the only ques
tion was whether it would be 
Saigon or Sarafina. He was sup
posed to hear from Saigon in a 
few days, and, of course, it was 
his first choice. If that didnt 
work out, he had decided, he 
would take the part in Sarafina.
Naturally, there was no phone 
call from Saigon, so he called 
Sarafina to accept that part, only 
to find out they had hired a 
person the phone call before 
mine.
At that point, says Porter, I 
knew that Saigon was going to 
happen ... because that was the 
only thing that was left. I have 
too much faith to feel so lost, and 
to feel so much like no one 
cares.... I was like, Lord, I dont 
know whats going on, but I know 
I havent been brought this far
just to be left here. I cant gradu
ate, I dont have a job, I dont 
have anything. And it did hap
pen, at long last.
The spirituality and faith that 
carried him through the diffi
culties surrounding his senior 
year and the casting of Saigon 
are impossible to miss in a con
versation with him. Its obvious 
that he draws strength and pur
pose from his faith in God. The 
sureness and self-confidence he 
exudes could come across as ar
rogance in someone else, but in 
Porter they dont, because he 
attributes his wonderful talent 
and success to God.
Evangelism through his mu
sic is an important part of what 
Porter feels is his purpose in life. 
Some of the worst-case sce
narios Ive heard of in my life 
have gone on right in the church, 
he says. And that, to me, is why 
Ive got to go out and reach the 
masses. Ive got to sing in the 
nightclub and say, There is a 
God. There is one. And you need 
to know him. I need to live a life 
that is presentable, and that is 
godly. Thats why he chose a lot 
of gospel music for his cabaret, 
and thats why the record con
tract hes looking for will be R&B 
and pop, but with a spiritual 
edge.
The CMU Drama Experience
Overall, Porter says, his edu
cation at Carnegie Mellon was 
worth everything it cost. Its 
rough, emotionally, he says. I 
must say I got solid training, to 
the point where I feel so pre
pared for anything that comes 
my way. [Coming into the 
Saigon chorus] I felt totally pre
pared.
One aspect of life in the New 
York theater world Porter was 
unprepared for upon leaving 
CMU was being pigeonholed. 
Nobody told me ... that when I
left I would be pegged as a black 
actor, and not an actor. It was 
hard; it was sort of a slap in the 
face.
I was forced to be that stereo
typical black thing, to be that 
rapper, to be that hood, the ste
reotypes of what middle America 
sees minorities as ... were 
whores, were pimps.
There have been auditions 
where Porter has been told he is 
too refined, too trained, too 
knowing, not raw enough, too 
polished. His response? Too 
POLISHED? Yes, Im polished; 
I just spent $80,000 to get pol
ished, and youre telling me Im 
not supposed to be? He explains, 
They dont want to see that [pol
ish] from a black actor, and no
body warned me about that.
Porter says he has received a 
great deal of support from his 
CMU classmates, and that his 
class was pretty close. He re
turns that support, saying, 
Theyre all just as talented; I 
just happened to do it faster.
Meanwhile, a number of other 
members of his class have found 
work in the notoriously jobless 
world of acting. Ty Taylor is tour
ing with The Music of Andrew 
Lloyd Weber, Mark Brettschneider has a three-year con
tract with the soap opera One 
Life to Live, Eric Woodall has a 
three-year contract with another 
soap, Loving, and N atalie Belcon 
got a part in the off-Broadway 
show And the World Goes Round, 
to name a few.
Porter is triumphant. The 
kids are working! he says glee
fully. Its a ratio that I dont 
think has ever happened. 
Theyre working, and if theyre 
not working now they will be 
working.
Our class said, Were gonna 
work. You have to be optimistic. 
You have to be the positive force 
in your life  nobody else is 
gonna be.
Billy means business
It takes a long time to leave 
Dont Tell Mama, in part be
cause Porter says good night to 
everyone, individually, at the 
door. One woman tells him that 
she recently lost a friend to AIDS, 
that she had given up on God, 
and that he had restored her 
faith with his songs. Abystander 
might be able to catch the glint 
of tears in her eyes, in his.
Later, he says, Thats all I 
wanted to do, you know, thats 
all I wanted to show. That there 
is something in this life that is 
positive.
Porter has recently landed the 
position of understudy for a new 
Broadway show, Five Guys 
Named Moe, which is to open in 
March. He is also scheduled to 
appear on Star Search in April.
His resolve to make a differ
ence in the world is evidenced by 
the calm but determined tone of 
his voice when he says he wants 
to let everybody in New York 
know that Billy Porter means 
business.... Hes not here to just 
play games. Hes not here to just 
be another chorus boy. Hes here 
to really make an impact on so

Environmental bulletin board 
sparks international interest
By MARN1 BLAKE
Tartan Staffwriter
Thousands of student envi
ronmentalists here and around 
the globe are now accessing 
free information, thanks to 
Carnegie Mellon freshman 
Josh Knauer. Knauer is the 
drivingforcebehindanew com
puter network called Student 
EnviroLink (E-link), which is 
designed to be a strictly non
profit group dedicated to pass
ing along pertinent informa
tion about environmental is
sues.
Knauer recently established 
E-Link as a free information 
exchange among student envi
ronmentalists. He says the ELink is totally autonomous 
from any other outside influ
ence. We do not have any officialviews, butrather just pass 
on others for discussion and 
debate.
The E-Link encourages dis
cussion on a wide variety of 
environmental topics. Some of 
the recent topics on the E-Link 
include letters for action to be 
sent to members of Congress, 
the onset of the deer hunting
season, elephant poachinginAfrican countries, school projects 
such as the environment ally safe 
disposal of cafeteria waste, and 
requests for help and advice.
In the two weeks of E-Links 
existence, there has already been 
a phenomenal amount of discus
sion and information exchanged. 
One hundred thousand people 
in seven different countries are 
currentlyinvolvedinthe E-Link, 
and the numbers continue to 
grow by the hour. Knauer sends 
information to representatives 
in Australia, Canada, Finland, 
USSR, Germany, GreatBritain, 
and the US, who then distribute 
the E-Link information to sub
scribers in their countries.
These worldwide connections 
are the E-Links primary ben
efit. Projects no longer have to 
take several months to get 
started and completed, because 
subscribers have access to infor
mation about what others have 
done and what sort of projects 
have been successful around the 
world. This way, explains 
Knauer, student environmental
ists can avoid reinventing the 
wheel over and over. Another 
advantage to the E-Link is that
communication through com
puters provides extremely 
quick, freeinformationwith
out using any paper. This way, 
E-Link really supports its own 
causes.
Knauer is adamant about 
providing this Internet infor
mation for free. I have already 
been offered rather large 
amounts of money to buy my 
distribution list, and I have 
refused, Knauer says. There 
arent any other free informa
tion networks out there. They 
all charge or are tied at the hip 
(and the wallets) with other 
groups who are badly influ
enced by industry and corpora
tions. I saw a large hole that 
needed to be filled in, so I did 
it.
Luckily, Knauer has several 
non-profit organizations be
hind him. The Students Envi
ronmental Action Coalition 
(SEAC) will soon be working 
with him, and the National 
Wildlife Federation is currently 
trying to get a grant to support 
the E-Link. And of course, he 
already has the support of 
many student environmental
ists here at CMU.
Schoenwald lectures on knowledge
AMY POTTHAST
Tartan Asst. Diversions Editor
As part of the Last Lecture 
Series, professor of history Ri
chard Schoenwald presented his 
lecture, titled What I Live For, 
What I Have Lived For, And 
What Im Going To Go on Living 
?or, Tuesday afternoon in the 
iVherrett Room. Although 
Schoenwald was opposed to the 
idea of delivering a last lecture, 
was willing to cooperate for 
he sake of the Last Lecture Se*es> a chance for faculty mem
bers to present their ultimate 
ecture.
From a startlingly young age, 
schoenwald has been driven by 
vhathe called his desire to lead 
he life of the mind. Although a 
quest for intellectual fulfillment 
jjill never end in omniscience, 
schoenwald set out on the quest 
jtod, once rolling, there was no 
turning back.
Why a hunger for knowledge? 
ccording to Schoenwald, To 
ecome an intellectual... is what 
^cation is all about, is what 
is all about. Everyone has 
rnething to accomplish in life, 
Whether it is so we can live for 
'hat our parents want, or what 
ttUr social class wants, or what 
^ Sender tells us to do. 
f,f?ause *n the grand scheme 
1 hings, each of us is only alwed a brief glimpse of life and 
e kving, Schoenwald emphalzed the dire importance of 
acking and exercising our 
r?lns as much as we are caa eQuoting Freud, who saidhatpeople ought to live [in
[, ] to love and to work, 
* oenwald explained that by 
0r Freud meant people 
0lJd Work very hard and sube he world and its terror.
Schoenwald went on to say 
that students have an especially 
important lesson to learn from 
his example. I had to seek the 
best always, because the cur
tain is going to come down. It 
really will be over for me.... So 
I work hard at the life of the 
mind. And I think students 
should, also. But they are young 
and its good for them to have 
space in their days... for a while. 
But Id worry about the long 
term usefulness of what theyre 
learning. They may get a lot of 
stuff thats current and destined 
to fade out ... and finally they 
turn into walking, unreflective 
corpses.
Carpe diem, seize the day, 
and catch your moment now, 
before it is too late. The years 
mount up. The by-and-bys, the 
Ill-do-it-when-I-have-times or 
the when-Im-olders are easy to 
come by, and suddenly one day 
you realize youre too tired... or 
youre too old, and its finished 
and done with, that dream of 
yours.
Schoenwald admits that hav
ing intelligence is not always 
the easiest burden to bear. 
Sometimes I become very em
barrassed about all this stuff 
about the life of the mind. And it 
sounds to me just too gooey and 
high-falutin. But then I remind 
myself that Im no longer the 
small child embarrassed about 
being smart, and the life of the 
mind is truly what I live for.
With his lofty goal in mind, 
Schoenwald expressed a desire 
to help his students by shaping 
them from his mold. When I 
ask students what an intellec
tual is, they immediately dis
claim wanting to be one. But I 
think we should keep them here. 
I think we should lock them up
for a fifth year ... until they 
change.
In a final point, touching on 
the important theme of commu
nity during life, Schoenwald con
fesses, I cant lead the life of the 
mind in solitude. And neither 
can you. Leading the life of the 
mind is essential because all 
life is a coming to be and a slip
ping and fading away. For stu
dents to grow, to mature their 
markedly virginal intellectual 
qualities, and to fulfill their 
purposes in life, they must disci
pline themselves and suck in 
knowledge, correct knowledge, 
like sponges. The consumption 
of knowledge is what 
Schoenwald lives for, has lived 
for, and will continue to live for.

What to do if youre at Carnegie 
Mellon during Thanksgiving
By BOB DIXON
Tartan Staffwriter
Its Thursday. Theres a huge 
turkey in the oven, deeply 
tanned and sitting in its own 
bubbling juices and every kind 
of squash and potato arranged 
in a strange haphazard order 
throughout the kitchen. In the 
refrigerator there are pumpkin, 
mince-meat, apple, chocolate, 
and lemon meringue pies. The 
television is flashing the bright 
colors of parades in New York 
and California, andyour old high 
school friends are talking about 
how much better the football 
team was when you were se
niors, and boy didnt Mrs. 
Teacher get fat. And youre sit
ting in your dorm room wishing 
that Highlander was open.
So, youre stuck at Carengei 
Mellon over Thanksgiving 
break. Besides whine and moan 
bitterly, what do you do? In case 
youre fresh out of ideas, com
pletely sapped of all intellectual 
capacity by the long and hard 
semester, heres a list of sugges
tions.
1. Beg, beg, beg.
It may not be the most noble 
thing to do, but try to get one of 
your near and dear friends to 
take you home for the holiday. 
You dont have to start grovel
ling on the floor, just drop the 
hint here and there that you 
have to go shopping for TV din
ners sometime because thats all 
youll be eating for a week. If 
thats too subtle for your friends, 
say Yeah, because Im going to 
be here for Thanksgiving, all by
myself. And if this still doesnt 
strike a brain cell, say Say, 
Friend, could I go home for 
Thanksgiving with you? Now 
heres the important part. If 
Friend doesnt immediately say 
yes, drop down on the floor and 
wrap yourself around Friends 
ankles, weeping. If this doesnt 
work, you can at least say that 
you made a good effort. Other 
humiliations later in life wont 
seem so bad.
2. Give in and have dinner by 
yourself.
A. Try to cook for yourself.
Honestly, this option scares 
me. I cant even follow the direc
tions on the back of the package 
of kidney beans without screw
ing up. Turkeys dont come with 
directions either, not to mention 
potatoes, squashes, and what
ever vegetable stuffing comes 
from. But if youre really good in 
the ldtchen, you can make the 
feast for yourself.
If youre not so brilliantly 
clever in the kitchen, there are 
always the pre-packaged, 
cooked, seasoned, and portioned 
foods. Pressed turkey roll from 
the deli-counter, canned cran
berry sauce, frozen vegetables, 
and those sort of old-looking pies 
from the bakery isle can be 
bought in one convenient stop 
at the nearest grocery store. All 
pre-somethinged foods come 
with directions too, in several 
different languages usually, so 
if one language doesnt sink in 
there are always other options.
If youre completely inept in 
the kitchen, like me, theres the 
frozen dinner isle at the grocery
store. Go there, pick out the tur
key and mashed potato dinner 
with the little brownie that never 
comes out right anyway, and 
take it back to the dorm and 
nuke it. You can get the chicken 
and mashed potato dinner in
stead if other college students 
beat you to the turkey.
B. Go out to Thanksgiving din
ner.
This is first, expensive, and 
second, tough to do. Restaurants 
that are affordable and serve on 
Thanksgiving Day are few and 
far between. Even Eat n Park is 
closed. If youre wealthy enough 
to go out to Thanksgiving din
ner, you should have hired some
one else to do your homework 
and bought a ticket home.
3. Reject the whole idea of 
Thanksgiving altogether and 
work on those final projects, 
papers, exams, etc.
This last one is a pretty dis
mal option, but youll probably 
do it anyway since youre here, 
even if its not the reason youre 
here. Thanksgiving break lasts 
from Tuesday night til Sunday 
night. You could get much work 
accomplished on all of those days 
that you dont have to go to class. 
It may even be possible to get 
caught up to where you were 
supposed to be at mid-semester.
If youre here for Thanksgiv
ing, dont get so depressed you 
dont eat anything at all; think 
how much work those people 
who left are going to have when 
they get back. If youre going 
home, eat an extra piece of pie 
for the less fortunate, or better 
yet, bring it back with you.

The Addams Family offers great acting but a weak plot

Ill admit that the idea of a 
movie based on The Addams 
Family didnt really excite me 
all that much. I was never that 
much of a fan of the show; in 
feet, it took me a good long time 
until I could tell the difference 
between members ofthe Addams 
and Munster clans. But the cast 
offered such wonderful poten
tial  Raul Julia (one of my 
favorite actors) as Gomez, 
Anjelica Huston as Morticia, and 
Christopher Lloyd as Uncle Fes
ter (a casting coup if ever there 
was one)! I had to see it.
The passing of time has been 
kind to the Addams family. 
Theyve gone from a New Yorker 
cartoon to a black-and-white TV 
show to a big-screen spectacle. 
Theyve got M.C. Hammer on 
the soundtrack. Hollywood has 
mally mastered the technology 
get Thing out of that box. 
hat more could one ask for? 
% original assessment of Tfte 
ddarns Family didnt change 
uch from seeing the movie. The 
ddams Family, plot-wise, isnt 
""ich better than the TV show, 
ut t*le performances make it 
'Vorth a look. The stars are im
pressive, but the support cast is 
equally good (Dan Hedaya, who 
P%s Nick TorteUi on Cheers, is

ognize).
The story goes something like 
this: Hedaya is the lawyer for 
the Addams family, and hes in 
financial trouble. Therefore, he 
sells Gomez (and the Addams 
family fortune) out to two con 
artists, one of whom poses as 
Fester (who left 25 years ago 
after a fight with Gomez) to in
filtrate the Addams house and 
get the money. The cons get the 
upper hand, using Festers sta
tus as the older Addams brother 
to kick Gomez and company out 
of the house, but they find out 
that the Addams family has not 
yet begun to fight. Of course, 
theres the obligatory happy end
ing, but you have to remember 
to suspend your disbelief for this 
film to work.
If you havent figured it out 
yet, theres one giant continuity 
hole here. Accordingto this story, 
the television show never hap
pened! Since the fight between
Fester and Gomez occurred 
while Gomez was single, how 
would Morticia know Fester? 
How would the kids? My friend 
Steve offered a plausible expla
nation by suggesting that this 
could be seen as a prequel to the 
TV show, but the transition 
should have been handled more 
smoothly. On the other hand, 
Batman had even larger holes to 
anyone who knew the original 
subject material, and look how 
much money that made.
The other thingthat disturbed 
me is this: Im guessing that 
they overwrote the movie and 
then cut to clean things up. The 
family party scene was probably 
pegged to be the special effects 
extravaganza that the Creature 
Cantina scene from Star Wars 
was, but looks like it was 
downscaled from there. Simi
larly, it seems that an extra halfhour would have probably clari
fied the link between the movie 
and the TV show.
On to the good things, though. 
Julia was an incredible Gomez 
Addams. If its at all possible to 
do something better than the 
original, Julia didit. John Astin, 
the original Gomez, always 
struck me as somewhat of a poor 
mans Groucho Marx; Julia cap
tures the eccentricity ofthe char
acter, but breathes his own life 
into it. Lloyd was a great choice 
for Fester, but what did you ex
pect? Ever since he played Jim 
on Taxi, Lloyds forte has been 
the madcap characterthelack 
of the whiny voice that the old 
Fester had is the only thingmissing. Huston certainly captures 
the look of Morticia, but some
thing about her rubs me the 
wrong way. The rest of the 
Addams family members did a
good job as wellthe only thing 
missing was Lurchs customary 
You rang. They probably would 
have had to pay him extra for a 
speaking part.
Atany rate,The Addams Fam
ily is probably going to be one of 
the fall seasons biggest releases. 
This will be the right idea for the 
wrong reason. What everyone
should be doing is saluting the 
marvelous acting and directing; 
instead, many are going to take 
this as a blanket cry for the 
return of the TV show, and well 
be swamped vnthAddamsFam
ily reruns seven days a week. 
Just hope no one uses this as a 
rationale for The Munsters: The 
Movie.
Shakin  the panes
EMF blasts the Skibo Ballroom
By MARNIBOREK
Tartan Asst. Diversions Editor
The sound check lasted forever last 
Monday afternoon. The five members 
of EMF remained in Skibo Ballroom 
until every guitar riff, every keyboard 
note, every drumbeat, and every sample 
bit had been adjusted to comply with 
the rooms acoustics. It seemed inevi
table that the windows would shatter 
from the enormous sound. Fortunately 
for EMF, there was no broken glass 
after the performance that night. They 
managed, instead, to loosen up a crowd 
of high school and college students with 
their music, frenzied stage presence, 
and simple yet striking light show. It is 
not often that a group can perform its 
music dynamically without listeners 
comparing the live versions to the al
bum versions, but EMF pulled it off.
One would think that playing in such 
a small and basically non-commercial 
room after the spread of their popular
ity would disappoint the members of 
EMF, but this type of qualm was cer
tainly not made evident. The band 
worked up the same type of sweat any 
big-name band would in a coliseum or 
concert hall.
We have a big system  big enough 
for theaters with 6,000 seats and up. 
But we love smaller rooms with stand
ing room only. Big, seated auditoriums 
arent proper for gigs, said EMF gui
tarist Ian Dench.
The crowd that gathered for the con
cert was a mixture of adolescents long
ing to observe the latest Teen Beat 
species, curious college students, and 
faithful fans in fashions ranging from 
Doc Martins to motorcycle jackets. The 
entire audience fidgeted, waiting for 
the group to get on stage. Some waited 
near the Ballroom windows hoping to 
catch a glimpse of group members as 
they walked by. Some talked excitedly 
about the new dredlock-like hairdo 
EMFs lead singer James Atkins would 
be sporting. Others inched closer to the 
groupies, praying that befriending them 
would be the ticket to meeting mem
bers of the band. The different reac
tions showed the different ranges of 
feelings towards the band.
Audiences vary from place to place, 
country to country, said Dench. En
gland is small enough for music to per
meate in relation to the U.S., so it is 
easier for audiences to recognize us 
there and maybe not get as excited; 
whereas places here dont get many 
bands like us.
As soon as the music started, the 
audience started pushing towards the 
stagethere was no room to dance, let
alone breathe. The only way to escape 
was to push at peoples faces. Intermit
tently, fans yearning to show their ac
robatic skills were hurled into the air 
by people around them. Those who acted 
as pacifists were outsiders in this audi
ence. The guidelines for a good time 
that evening were pushing, shoving, 
jumping, and dancing about. Any tame 
clapping or stomping was unaccept
able. EMF likes to cause minor types of 
havoc in the audience.
Usually we like to see smoking and 
drinking going on at our shows. Its 
great escapism. Our light show is so 
brilliant, so its like a trip to the audi
ence, expressed Dench.
EMF interacted well with the crowd, 
egging on the excitement. Bass player 
Zac Foley stole cigarettes from audi
ence members, drummer Mark Decloedt 
brought his drum sticks down hard, 
immune to the deafening noise,-perry 
Brownson viciously smacked around 
his sampler, and Atkins, shaking his 
elevated hairdo, screamed out to the 
audience to show more enthusiasm, 
especially as the demand for an encore 
became emphaticYoure not getting 
a fuckin encore with that!
With this energy, EMFs U.S. hits, 
Unbelievable and Lies were per
formed successfully, but there were 
several other musical highlights of the 
evening that were more than sensa
tional the first was the opening num
ber I Believe. Although the live ver
sion was very much like the one on the:; 
album, the live version had more en-. 
ergy and spark which made people want 
to dance. This had a lot to do with the 
more rock n roll sound, rather than an 
electronic one. The song lost its key
board wah-wah sound and found a 
stronger bass line. Atkins drove his 
voice into the audience emphasizing 
every I believe. His cutting raspy 
English accent was of much assistance 
in emphasizing the lyrics.
Long Summer Days was also done' 
spectacularly with Foleys overempha
sized guitar. It was as if Foley were 
attacking the guitar. He was hunched 
over the instrument, pulling at the 
strings throughout every number. It 
wasnt hard to hear the energy going 
into his solos. Dench was the cool, col
lected musician of the bunch, giving off 
a somewhat comical Arthur Fonzarelli 
aura.
The group also performed four new 
songs which veered away from the pop 
style heard on Schubert Dip. There was 
a lot more guitar that defined the music 
as more thrashy. Because of the more: 
dominant guitar and drums in these

Ribbed: We pumped three and a 
half gallons of Old Milwaukee 
into this condom, until it looked 
like an over-inflated beach ball, 
and then dropped it off a sevenstory building onto a bed of nails. 
The Stimula never ruptured, 
but the so-called vibra-ribs 
ceased to vibrate. We find this 
unacceptable, especially since 
we didnt notice the defect until 
someone had already used the 
same condom later that night. 
He was very upset.
The Sheik Fetherlite Snug-Fit: 
To see just how snug it was, we 
pulled this condom down over 
Luke Springers head to see if 
we could make out his facial 
features while he was wearing 
it. Not only could we see the 
perfect outline of his nose, cheek
bones, lips, and chin, but Luke 
also couldnt breathe, proving 
that the advertising claims of a 
total Latex vacuum during 
condom use were true! We 
strongly recommend this brand. 
(We also ask that if you pur
chase a Fetherlite, you make a 
donation to the Luke Springer 
Memorial Fund.)
The Protex Contracept Plus: 
Stinky! Im sorry, we dont go 
any farther when we cant get 
past the opening of the package.
Trojan Kling-Tite Naturalamb: Condoms made out of lamb 
intestines have always struck 
us as a little kinky, but we will 
do anything to support the de
pressed Texas sheep industry. 
We tried all the usual tests on 
this one, couldnt break it, so we 
stuffed it with cherry bombs, 
threw it in an incinerator, went 
back four hours later  and it 
was still in one piece, ready for 
action. They didnt carry em in 
Vietnam for nothing.
Finally, weve got your Lady 
brands  Lady Trojan, Lady 
Protex UltraThin, Lady Excita 
Extra, Lady LifeStyles Nuda  
and, when these first came out, 
we were skeptical. Can you re
ally trust a woman to buy the 
condom, use the condom, take 
care of the condom? Then some
body told us that the man still 
has to wear these condoms! Can 
you believe this? Weve got to do 
everything already. I dont see 
the point. What if you die during 
sex? You want your family to 
read a coroners report that says, 
Deceased had lacerations on his 
clavicle, a slight deformity ofthe 
left kneecap, and was wearing a 
Lubricated Lady Fiesta Nude 
Plus with Ribbing? I think not.
Well pass.
Speaking of protection, Mor
gan Fairchild is a hooker with 
an attitude in Midnight Cop, 
and I havent seen her do work 
this good since Phantom of the 
Mall. The woman definitely 
knows how to wear a sequined 
mini-dress with pumps, and 
shes single-handedly preserved 
crimpie Farrah Fawcett hair
dos for the nineties. Im in awe.
This is one of those weird flicks 
that looks All-American  it 
even has Frank Stallone in it  
but turns out to be a made-inGermany deal where everyone 
speaks English and tries to avoid 
driving past any signs that have 
German writing on them. What 
are they trying to do with these 
things? If theyre making a Ger
man movie, make agoldurn GerSpend an evening with EMF
; JEMF, from page L9
:^songs, EMF has turned away 
. from its original mainstream 
style.
1 The new songs have different 
attitude and energy, said 
Dench. The new music is a bit 
darker  this is basically the 
direction that we want to go in.
After over an hour of enter
taining the crowd, EMF finally 
reached its two encores, which 
tiireatened the Ballrooms win
dow panes the most. Children 
/started out full blast with 
''samples of an ambulance siren 
ahd booming guitar riffs. The 
music was so loud that it was 
'difficult to hear Atkins voice. 
Hie final song was the EMF 
theme song, in which every 
'band member screamed out E 
' ... stands for ecstasy ... M ...
' rjiotherfucker motherfucker... 
The latter was definitely a 
standout that people will sing 
for days. Its right up there with
2 Live Crews catchy tune Pop 
That Coochie.
The one factor that made the 
bands performance so impres
sive was how each member of 
tjhe band was in synch with the 
other. Although much of the 
show revolved around Atkins 
vocals, there was no musical 
dominance of any kind; each 
band member was a leader. 
Atkins didnt pull a David Lee 
/Jftoth move and jump around the 
,^tage blocking out the view of 
' Jpiher band members. Foley 
.didnt step to the center of the 
.'stage to play a guitar solo and 
' reach out to the screaming fourteen-year-olds. Brownson didnt 
Ipring his sampler up to the front,
; qjiow it to the audience, and then 
Spiash it to the floor. This is 
. spmething thats not always 
. seen.
Jesus Jones is a good band, 
but Mike Edwards [the lead 
. singer] writes everything and 
 goes into the studio and records. 
Hes the front man while other 
^embers of the band end up 
playing the bits, explained 
Dench. None of us are virtuosos 
like that. We have a musical 
director, but we work together.
The band members friend
ships and their ability to get 
along after a long year of touring 
are also what makes the music 
so good. There was never a hint 
of boredom with the music or 
with each other on stage.
Sometimes we slap each other 
around, joked Dench. Weve 
been on tour for more than a 
year, but we get along. When we 
go home, its hard to tell people 
what weve been through, so well 
hang about with each other.
The final touch that tied EMFs 
concert into its perfect package 
was the light show. There were 
tracks of different colored lights 
on and surrounding the stage. 
The light patterns would change 
with the mood of each song. The 
basic colors of lights used were 
blue, green, white, and red. They 
would either flash back and forth 
rapidly or roam the stage like 
spotlights. Smoke was also used 
to enhance the light show.
EMF made its way through 
the club scene in Pittsburgh af
ter the show. They did the basic 
public relations autograph-sign
ing party at the Upstage. Club
bing has become a tradition for

Were all over 21 except for 
Zac, so going to clubs isnt a 
problem, Dench remarked. Im 
27 and I still find it a lot of fun. 
I never grew up anyway. Im 
still involved in this stuff. Never 
got a proper job.
After such a successful year 
with two big hit singles and a 
slew of incredible live perfor
mances, one might wonder what 
lies ahead for EMF. Will they 
survive? Or will they do as many 
American two-hit wonder 
dance groups do and fall off the 
face of the earth?
The vein of American pop 
groups now is dreadfully glitzy. 
Were not like that, Dench com

fifth album.

Get ready! Its almost time for the Christmas specials!
Turn on your TV in the next 
few days, and youll be sure to 
find a Christmas special of some 
sort. Thats right, Christmas is 
still a month away, and Thanks
giving has not even occurred yet, 
but the mammoth monster of 
yuletide cheer should be rearing 
its ugly head any minute now.
Multiple specials, celebra
tions, and spectaculars take 
place on the screen every year. 
Each December seems to bring 
with it yet another preachy car
toon, hokey TV movie, or celeb
rity extravaganza, all celebrat
ing the spirit of Christmas. 
Add these to the myriad of spe
cials which already exist, and 
you just might be overwhelmed.
Theres no need to let the sheer 
number of Christmas specials 
keep you from enjoying a few 
good ones, however. Leave it to 
The Laugh Track to give you a 
guide to whats worthwhile on 
the Xmas scene.
All right, its true that my 
Christmas viewing has faltered 
in recent years; Ive made a point 
to catch reruns of my favorites 
while purposefully avoiding new 
productions. And though i prob
ably watched at least a hundred 
different Christmas specials as 
a child, I can only remember a 
handful of them.
In other words, this is by no 
means a complete list. Rather, 
its a brief look at a few shows I 
have fond memories of and
THE LAUGH TRACK
Mi ek D/-oEnfo Avllnl/
wouldnt mind watching again.
Lets start with the classics. 
Frosty the Snowman leaps to 
mind first. This could be used to 
outline the vast majority of 
Christmas cartoons: youve got 
a nice main character trying to 
fit in (Frosty), good people who 
love him (Santa and little girl 
who becomes Frostys compan
ion in the course of the story), 
numerous problems to overcome 
(the little girl freezing, Frosty 
melting), the obligatory RMG 
(Really Mean Guyin this case, 
an evil magician), cute support
ing characters (numerous wood
land creatures), and an ani
mated version of a famous nar
rator (either Jimmy Durante or 
Bing Crosby; I cant remember 
which).
There are all sorts of specials 
that share this base, but most of 
them blend together in my fal
tering memory. Frosty stands 
out. Who can forget the classic 
scenes: Frosty coming to life 
when the magicians hat is 
placed on his head, his joyous,
carefree dancing, the escape on 
the train, and the poignant, pain
ful scene in the greenhouse when 
our little heroine thinks that 
shes lost Frosty forever. Silly 
stuff, kind of corny, but hard to 
resist.
Closely related to the Frostman is Rudolph the Red-Nosed 
Reindeer. This is one of several 
specials that used a claymation 
process (far inferior to todays 
Raisins, but still pretty neat). 
This one is fuzzier in my memory, 
but I do remember an Island of 
Lost Toys, full of sad, dejected 
playthings that kids from around 
the world have misplaced or for
gotten about. Its a cool idea, and 
it sets up a couple of pretty jazzy 
musical numbers.
I always get this special mixed 
up with Rudolphs Shiny New 
Year, where the rouge-nosed one 
must overcome all sorts of ob
stacles (and a really ugly, icy 
RMG) to save the Baby New 
Year and, in the process, the 
world as we know it. This one 
gets extra points for being the 
only New Years cartoon that I 
know of.
Of course, Christmas wouldnt 
be Christmas without a half hour 
of the Peanuts gang. A Charlie 
Brown Christmas is a simple 
story with familiar characters 
that never fatts to move me in 
some way. Its worth watching 
just to see Charlie Brown come 
out on top for once, as his little
forlorn evergreen ends up more 
beautiful than any pink alumi
num tree could ever hope to be.
The most well-known and well
loved Christmas classic has to 
be Dr. Seuss How the Grinch 
Stole Christmas. The story, clas
sic Seuss, combined with great 
animation and memorable mu
sic, make for a legendary thirty 
minutes. I bet that at least half 
of the CMU population could 
recite this story from memory 
thats impressive. The Grinch 
moved to cable station TNT a 
couple of years ago, so its harder 
to find, but that makes it seem 
even more special.
While we all know the clas
sics, there have been some addi
tions to the Christmas crop in 
the past few years that deserve 
a look. First off, A Claymation 
Christmas simultaneously cel
ebrates and lampoons the holi
day with great success. Two 
Siskel & Ebert-ish dinosaurs 
introduce numerous skits. The 
California Raisins are featured, 
of course, but my favorite part is 
a hilarious/serious doo-wop ren
dition of We Three Kings. A 
few years down the road, this 
one will be a classic too.
Another relative newcomer is 
Garfields Christmas. I admit 
that I have a soft spot for this 
obese feline, and this special 
captures the biting sarcastic 
humor that made the comic strip 
so enjoyable in its early years.
Today, Garfield, with his culi
nary habits, defines the word 
overexposure, but this special 
shows him at his best.
Finally, theres The Simpsons 
Christmas Special. This was 
actually the pilot for the televi
sion series, but its been released 
on video with this title. In the 
first full-length Simpsons ad
venture, Homer works as Santa 
in the nearby mall to make extra 
money for the holidays. How
ever, he ends up betting all the 
money at the dog track. The re
sult, of course, is the hapless but 
nice dog, Santas Little Helper. 
Worth watching to see how it all 
began, and to see how the 
Simpsons have changed.
No list of TV Christmas spe
cials would be complete without 
mentioning films that are part 
of the holiday tradition. In my 
mind, the film most associated 
with Christmas has to be Its a 
Wonderful Life. Frank Capras 
simple, uncomplicated portrait 
of a man with values trying to 
make it in a town run by a tyrant 
always gets the oP tears a-flowing. It is one of those God bless 
us all specials. Jimmy Stewart 
and Donna Reed head an excel
lent cast. This is more than a 
piece of propaganda for the 
American dream  its an ex
tremely well-done and affecting 
piece of propaganda.
Miracle on 34th Street provides 
a more light-hearted story, as a
little girl tries to prove the exist
ence of Santa Claus. A nice little 
Christmas tale to get you into 
the spirit. K
A Christmas Carol has been 
made several times, in several 
different ways. Almost all of 
them are good. From Alistair 
Sim to George C. Scott, from 
Mickey Mouse to Bill Murray, 
and even Henry Winkler, .this 
story has been paid homage oyer 
and over again. Its hard to^-get 
through a Christmas season 
without seeing at least one of 
these incarnations.
A film made recently is quickly 
becoming a Christmas tradition 
itself. A Christmas Story jp a 
nostalgic look at the holiday fjjom 
the point of view of a boy grow
ing up in the fifties. Christmas 
for him means a new Red Ryder 
b-b gun. The situations arei fa
miliar and funny, peaking in a 
hilarious Christmas dinner, t a 
Chinese restaurant. Think of it 
as a precursor to The Wonder 
Years. at
And that wraps up another 
semester for The Laugh Track. 
To grossly misquote Casey 
Kasem, keep your feet on .the 
ground and your eyes glue^ to 
the tube. Ill be back next semes

Spend a sizzling evening of dance with the Ballet Hispnico
By MARY YEE
Tartan Staffwriter
Inherent in the Ballet Hispanicos 
style is the Latin flavor, with its upbeat 
music and dazzling moves that will 
inspire you to dance with them. One of 
the most reputable and professional 
companies of today, Ballet Hispanico 
recently celebrated its 20th anniver
sary.
Debuting in Pittsburgh at the Fulton 
Theatre, the performance will comprise 
of five pieces, two of which are untitled. 
The three titled pieces are Stages, Cafe 
America, and Llamada. Together with 
the unnamed dances, they present vari
ous integrated perspectives of the 
companys style.
Opening the evening will be Stages. 
Performing dances about life nourishes 
the development of artists as they 
progress in their careers. Because the 
word stages connotes many aspects of 
an artists maturity, this piece was de
signed to show this progression. Stages 
portrays the multi-faceted artistic vi
sions that are integrated into the 
performers repertoire. Throughout this 
piece, no boundaries grow between the 
performers and the observer. It is the 
failures and successes of the artists 
which attract others to share in their 
talents. Says Artistic Director Tina 
Ramirez, There are three different 
styles conveyed in the 25-minute dura
tion of this piece. Glamorized by the 
high heels, these changes promote a 
challenge to the dancer, but it is a 
learning experience that they will conDance Preview

tinue to develop in their careers.
Dreams of a better life have always 
been one of the principal reasons why 
America is unique in attracting people 
from around the world. Cafe America 
explores this theme of immigrants 
hopes in America over a span of two 
hundred years. In many respects, the 
work allows the Ballet Hispanico to 
display their interpretation and reflec
tion on their dreams of America. Adds 
Ramirez, There are many quick turns 
and arabesques. These dazzling, spin
ning, movements create a panorama of 
the many changes immigrants adopted 
in their American Uves. In coming to 
America, each immigrant group 
brought their cultures with them to 
share with others. These differences 
have brought us together and united 
our understanding in developing a cul
tural mix unique to the United States.
Llamada, the third piece on the pro
gram, has several meanings. In En
glish, llamada connotes a call or a cry. 
Expands Ramirez, This is the most 
difficult piece on the program. There 
are many different techniques. A 
woman does the jeter from left to right. 
The jeter is a rapid shifting of weight of 
the dancers body from one toe to the
next. In art, we try to make it look easy. 
What makes the jeter difficult is the 
rapidity, giving little time preparation 
for the dancer to transfer the weight of 
their body from one toe to the other.
Of the two untitled pieces, one of 
them is Ballet Hispanicos interpreta
tion of the 500 year anniversary of 
arrival of Columbus in America. Set in 
modem day eastern New York, it cap
tures the Hispanic communitys point 
of view of the event. This piece is a 
quasi-narrative work about the voyage 
and landing of Columbus. During the 
groups rehearsal of the piece, 
Carolelinda Dickey, Executive Direc
tor of the Pittsburgh Dance Council, 
was so excitedby the spectacular moves 
that she found herself gripping the edge 
of her seat. Ramirez assured Dickey 
that the magnificent work would be 
finished for its Pittsburgh debut.
Since 1970, Ramirez, who founded 
the Ballet Hispanico, has devoted her
self to the development of the school 
and the company. In addition to receiv
ing many awards for her work, includ
ing the the Governors Art Award from 
Mario Cuomo, the Award of Honor for 
Arts and Culture from Edward I. Koch, 
and the Manhattan Borough 
Presidents Award from David N. 
Dinkins, she also currently serves on 
the National Endowment for the Arts 
Dance Panel.
Bom in Venezuela, Ramirez came to 
the United States at the age of seven. 
Her interest in dance can be attributed 
to her father. Ramirez explains, My 
father was a Spanish bullfighter. He
AifrLbou eTf 8eTwI .breT-k nli UeVVin 6otpeTow-y
courtesy Pittsburgh Dance Council
was very good with the cape. His art
istry and dance fascinated me. My sis
ter took dance lessons to improve her 
health. I had to convince my mother, for 
a year, that I wanted to take them 
also. Since then, she has appeared in 
Broadway productions of Kismet and 
Lute Song.
Funding has always been a problem 
with the arts. Ramirez says, With new 
work, there is the challenge of raising 
money and finding the right people to 
work together, the dancers, choreogra
phers, and the integration of their 
styles. Because money for the arts is 
limited in the United States, you only 
have 40 hours to produce a piece, in 
addition to the costumes, fighting, and 
scenery. Despite this shortage offunding, the production of art is exciting, 
and subsidies in the U.S. help alleviate 
some of this difficulty.
Success is always welcomed by per
formers and the creators. Ramirez says, 
Im very satisfied when there is ^ood 
choreography with excellent dancing 
so that the audience enjoys the show. I 
feel that my role in the arts is to bridge 
the cultural mix and the story! of 
America. In doing this, I welcome 
friends along the way, with people I 
know and with those who become^my 
new audiences.
So come share the excitement of*the 
Ballet Hispanico and join the fun. Ab
sorb their Latin influence and capture 
their unique styles. Capture their daz
zling performance.
Pittsburgh Ballet performs a triple whammy of dance at Benedum Center
By MARY YEE
Tartan Staffwriter
Three wonderfully graphic 
pieces were performed by the 
Pittsburgh Ballet at the 
Benedum Center this weekend. 
Each 20th century piece each 
had its own distinct character, 
clearly showing each choreo
graphers signature scrawled 
across the dancersmovements. 
Such diversity blended to pro
duce a spectacular show. The 
three pieces included were In 
the Glow of the Night, Apollo, 
and The River.
The scenes in nature that were 
presented never cease to amaze. 
The rise of dawn to dusk, and 
the evening filled with stars have 
always fascinated people. 
Thanks to the choreography of 
the late Choo-San Goh, In the 
Glow of the Night traced the 
passage of a single night from 
dusk to dawn. He integrated the 
mystery, glitter, and passion of 
the night with enough sincerity 
^ud sensitivity to capture the 
hearts of the audience.

and the dancers flamboyant 
movements held their own 
against the vibrant purple, blue, 
and orange shades in the back
ground horizon. Not only were 
the dancers costumes amazing, 
but also their flowing hand mo
tions, appeared to be one with 
the soft music.
The definite struggle in In the 
Glow of the Night involves a 
womans continuous attempt to 
escape her death. As the pro
gression of dancers on stage 
moves from left to right, she 
followed. Her resistance, along 
with her tiny steps and leaps, 
made her performance classic. 
As she fights to save her life, it 
becomes obvious that her situa
tion is hopeless. She accepts her 
fate with the grace, beauty, and 
elegance of one who has pride,
dignity, and understanding of 
death. Closing the piece was 
dawn again, ending the days 
cycle, and so connecting 
humanitys similar and continu
ous struggle with life and death.
The next piece, Apollo, is about 
the god of music, poetry, and 
beauty. Choreographed by 
George Balanchine with music 
by Igor Stravinsky, Apollo 
loosely tells the story of how the 
mythical figure developed his 
talents and skills. Flowing with 
slow, calm music, the piece opens 
with Apollo wrapped in white 
and brought to life.
Three goddesses train Apollo 
to become one with Heaven 
through intertwined, fluid 
dance. Their twirling leaps con
veyed a sense of free-form move
ment and flexibility on stage. 
Each goddess shows him the 
meaning of each instmments 
music. They lure him to love the 
creation of dance. After the god
desses danced, enchanting mu
sic and a sense of wonder fill the 
atmosphere of Apollos self-dis
covery and progression of learn
ing grace. It is the momentous
music that closed the piece as 
Apollo climbed up the steps, fol
lowed by the three goddesses, 
that created the climax. Their 
costumes turned gold from the 
rays of the sun as Apollo achieves 
his position as a god.
Many things in nature imi
tate peoples progression 
throughout fife. Alvin Alleys The 
River utilized river movements 
to illustrate an allegory of birth, 
life, and rebirth. Duke 
Ellingtons jazzy, contemporary 
style made this piece the most 
aggressive and memorable.
Known for their energy, sen
suality, and directness, Mr. 
Aileys dances appealed to ev
eryone. The pulse of the AfroCaribbean rhythm, combined 
with Ellingtons jazzy style, was 
irresistible. Sensuous quick 
twirls and turns, upbeat rhythm, 
integrated with the dance move
ments moved perfectly in time 
with the music.
Dizzying lifts and sexy jazz 
riffs synchronized with the danc
ing to create the mood for fun. 
The dancers taunted and 
tempted the audience to follow
them with their outreaching 
arms.
Romantic attraction and irre
sistibleness closed the piece. At 
first, the two dancers were apart, 
but the music woos them into 
falling in love with each other. 
These two strong-willed people 
swayed, their arms embracing 
each other with welcomed en
ergy and emotion. A touching 
moment, the two lovers are con
vincing.
Janek Schergen, Ballet Mas
ter, is familiar with such beau
tiful movements. Says Schergen, 
My motivation to teach other 
dancers is to create the right 
aura and the right perfume to 
create the perfect dance. Un
like most teachers, however, 
Schergen believes that he is only 
the conduit of the dancers suc
cess in their movements. He ex
plains, Teachers offer informa
tion to good students, who in 
turn teach themselves. Students 
who wait around for the magic 
formula to appear find success 
hard to achieve. I can show 
people steps, but unless a per
son acts aggressively on getting
things accomplished, succ'ess 
will not happen.
Shergens love for ballet is es
pecially revealing in continuing 
Choo San Gohs In the Glow of 
the Night. Adds a passionate 
Schergen, I love ballet more 
than anything in life. Contact 
movement is very powerful. 
Thats why when you have sditiething important to say, you usu
ally touch someones shoulder 
before you say it, to ease the 
pain. In his transition from 
dancer to teacher, Schergeniiias 
also adjusted well. Rem^Fks 
Schergen,I had a moderatjely 
hard time in my transition ffbm 
performing part to observing 
part. I was now being viewecfby 
the audience indirectly. How
ever, I now feel that I am one in 
feeling the music inside of as 
a teacher.
The performance united.the 
experiences of peoples lives with 
dance. As Schergen says,i-believe everyone has dance inside 
of them waiting to come out. 
The resulting show is sure ppof 
that Schergens philosoj#iy 
works.

^Excellent Adventure. In this sequel, our bogus heros 
must duel a pair of evil robots who were sent back 
from the future to kill off Bill and Ted  and they

Hey, are Os fries greasy?
Bill & Teds Bogus Journey wont Win any major 
i kinematic awards , but it is a funny filmmuch
.funnier than the original. In addition, the plot is 
told well and wraps itself up neatly. The only 
,, disappointing aspect of this movie is the ending,

Thelma and Louise
Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis star as Louise 
and Thelma, who go off for a wild women-only 
weekend together that turns out to be much wilder 
.. than either expected. They end up on the run from 
the law and on their way to Mexico after Louise 
Shoots a man for raping Thelma. Almost all the men 
in the movie are antagonists out to objectify the 
women, steal from them, dominate them, or arrest 
:them. Thelma and Louise do all they can to keep 
 their dignity and show the men they are people to be 
reckoned with.
This is the film that turned into the surprise 
! pocial consciousness movie of last summer. The 
j feminist bent of ittwo very strong female charac
ters rebelling against a male-dominated society  
caused debate as soon as the movie appeared. Some 
hailed it as a triumph for feminism, others said it 
was only about women tossed into traditionally 
male roles, handling them as men would, not as 
women would. Whichever side of that particular 
fence you find yourself on, the movie is still funny, 
well-acted, and worth every penny of that dollar.

Jungle Fever
Spike Lee does it again in his latest cinematic 
blizzard of candor, Jungle Fever. Following in the 
footsteps of his other socially conscious works School 
Daze and Do the Right Thing, Jungle Fever con
fronts societys awkwardness in dealing with rela
tionships that cross racial, ethnic, geographic, and 
cultural lines.
With a daring drug-related subplot and compel
ling performances from its stars, including Wesley 
Snipes, Annabella Sciorra, Ossie Davis, and Lee 
himself, Jungle Fever raises some excellent, thoughtprovoking questions, although it struggles with 
some of the answers. Even the music by Stevie 
Wonder and Terence Blanchard is complementary.
An interesting piece, to say the least, Jungle 
Fever is a must-see for all those who havent seen it, 
and a should-see-again for those who have.

Nevermind enters the hard-rock field
By MIKE SHAPIRO
Tartan Senior Staffwriter
Gloom, cryptic cynicism, mor
dant vulgarity. Electric guitar. 
Sound familiar? The barefaced 
threesome Nirvana is the new
est kid on the hard-rock-pluspathos block. Their newest of
fering, Nevermind, though suf
fering from an advanced case of 
pretension, has enough chunky 
granules of interest so as not to 
entirely slip through the colan
der of distaste.
As you saunter through the 
record store of your choice, your 
attention is liable to be drawn 
unwittingly to the albums cover: 
a nude infant underwater being 
lured in by a dollar bill on a 
fishing line. This unsettling pic
ture symbolizes the album as a 
whole: disturbing imagery, por
tentous philosophical overtones, 
and no real content. But its done 
oddly well.
Nirvanas songs are as stylis
tically homogeneous as Dear 
Abby. The vocals are like a back 
street in a haunted village that 
suddenly opens onto a four-lane
 Record Review  
 8dNdLM'8xy UI 8oraeTey
freeway: first wandering with 
eerie deliberation, then break
ing into high-speed, rasping 
frenzy. The melodies are dark, 
but calculated. Nirvana does 
well to avoid those pockets of 
musical clich that seem to mar 
even the best of contemporary 
rock.
The band often incorporates 
background vocals to flesh out 
their tonality. This makes some 
of the pieces oddly soothing, like 
a thank-you note left in a bur
glarized car. It doesnt, however, 
make it any easier to separate 
the vocals from the sea of distor
tion and drums, nor to have the 
faintest idea what they alleg
edly mean when you do. No tran
scription of the lyrics is included 
with the alburn^ and perhaps 
thats for the best. Youre more 
likely to appreciateNeverminds 
interesting twists if youre not 
distracted by the meaningless 
crypticism.
1991 The David Geffen Company
The opening track, Smells 
Like Teen Spirit, sets the tone 
for the album: fast-moving, omi
nous self-indulgence. The re
maining 11 tracks vary from this 
archetype, but not much. A few 
other numbers stick out from 
the mass, such as the more placid 
and acoustic Polly, but for the 
most part its only a matter of 
which key the song is in and how 
apoplectic the screaming gets. 
Yet many of the pieces are like
able in some unfathomable man
ner, inspiring the hope that tal
ent cant be overwhelmed by the 
noxiousness of its owners.
Nevermind is an hour long, if 
you count the 15 minutes of si
lence between the end of the last 
song (Something in the Way) 
and the secret bonus track that 
they slip in at the very end. Ill 
bet they thought they were being very clever and Beatles, 
esque, but this subterfuge becomes somewhat ineffective on 
CD. The nameless extra track 
sounds like the band members 
threw their instruments down 
eight flights of stairs, but it was 
thoughtful of them to give us 
something extra.
Nevermind is one of those albums that grows on you, much 
as you wish it might not. On first 
listening, youre liable to label it 
as dissonant crud, although 
catchy dissonant crud that per
haps youd like to hear again. 
After a few playings, and the 
realization that you dont need a 
voice more melodic than a drill 
press in order to sing along, you 
may very well decide to allocate 
it a space on your CD rack. 
Nevermind doesnt have the in
tellectual content of Bob Dylan, 
and maybe not even Hammer, 
but there are a few noodles 
amidst the murky broth.
Two comic books attempt to fight the Power
Dear Santa,
I am writing to you from a 
rehab clinic. You see, in an at
tempt to clean up my somber life 
I have admitted myself to an 
institution designed to lift the 
insidious curse of comic book 
addiction from my weary shoul
ders. Sadly enough, I ran myself 
into bankruptcy after this years 
multiple cover scams, devilish 
marketing schemes, and price 
increases. The counselors here 
are very nice, and I have made 
many new friends that suffer 
from the same affliction that 
drove me to seek help.
Yet, I simply cannot sleep! 
They have isolated us from all 
sensory stimuli in order that we 
may rediscover the world. We 
float in tanks by day, are given a 
strict diet of com and starch at 
meal times, and sew our eyelids 
shut at night so that we are 
blind even to the shadows  it 
can grow quite tiresome at times.
I feel that I am disciplined 
enough to reenter society and be 
productive, yet they have sapped 
my strength and intend to keep 
me here forever so that they 
may fill their fat capitalist stom
achs with the last remnants of 
my savings. Santa, save me! 
Send me some comics so that I 
may gain the strength to escape 
from this prison! I have already 
made a list of inspirational books 
that fight the Power.
The Power! Santa, it causes 
me such angst! Billi 99 is a pow
erful tale set in an increasingly 
fascist, apathetic, corrupt 
America. I see in this story fright
ening predictions for the future 
that ring alarmingly true. In the 
decaying metropolis of Billi 99, 
the police are funded by private 
industry, legislation has been 
passed, revoking half the Bill of 
Rights in high crime zone[s], 
and the capitalist dictators run 
rampant over the exploited pro
letariats. This dismal world is 
the home of Billi Chadam, the 
adopted daughter of a kind, 
gentle man  and a wealthy 
man, a capitalist with a heart of 
gold and a secret identity as well. 
He is the hero, The Toleado, a 
Zorroesque crime fighter with a 
passion for justice.
When Mr. Chadam gets in the 
way of despicable capitalist 
Brutus, he is murdered and his 
19 year-old daughter is framed 
for the dark crime. She runs 
from her bourgeois world to the 
underbelly of urban civilization. 
There she assumes the identity

of The Toleado and begins her 
quest for the murderer of her 
father. The pursuit evolves into 
an engrossing crime story where 
murder, mystery, and rage 
abound. Can Billi fight the 
Power? Will her struggle against 
impossible hurdles lead to frui
tion, or will she be crushed by 
the apathetic heel of a world 
that steps on any aberration like 
a child on ants?
This is clearly a very personal 
work for the two relatively new 
faces behind this highly cin
ematic tale. Writer Sarah Byam 
and artist Tim Sale do an ex
traordinary job of creating a 
sense of urgency in this work, a 
sense of reality that comes from 
a commitment to the message 
behind the story. The artwork is 
moody and packed with torn 
emotion. The cast of characters 
is diverse and filled with per
sonality. This is a very impres
sive piece of work that is guar
anteed to please, and I know 
Santa that if you could simply 
deliver it unto me, I could find 
the resolve to fight the power in 
my own world of starch and com.
I want more! Santa please see 
to it that you bring Aquaman 
with you when you traipse down 
the chimney. Believe me, I swear 
my habit is under control. I know 
this book is diametrically op
posed to Billi 99 in every con
ceivable way, but it is irresist
ible. Perhaps I was imprinted by 
the orange and green costume 
at a young age, but Aquaman is 
just too neat of a concept. He 
breathes underwater, talks to 
fish, swims fast, and is a role 
model to the oppressed every
where.
Hes not the same Aquaman 
you must have known when you 
were growing up. This is a man 
who was king of Atlantis, mar
ried and had a child, and then 
tragically lost it all! Everything, 
just like that! There are many 
scars that havent healed and 
the journey into the mind and 
soul of Aquaman will most defi
nitely be exciting, because for 
the first time in many years he 
has his own book again. So what

if the story starts off in a pain
fully clich way. That is: 
Aquaman is wandering the seas 
searching for inner peace, a veri
table outcast, when suddenly his 
kingdom is invaded for the ump
teenth time, and he must rush 
back to save the day. Neverthe
less, in a different kind of way, 
Aquaman is fighting the Power!
In spite of this poor start plotwise, the character is difficult to 
stay away from. The creative 
team of Aquaman, like Billi 99, 
is relatively new to the field. I 
read an interview with the writer 
in some comic journal last 
month, and it seems to me that 
writer Shane McLaughlin has 
given the book a lot of thought 
and is indeed quite dedicated to 
making the most of his opportu
nity. The artwork (by Ken 
Hooper and Bob Dvorak) is above 
average. The covers are provided 
by former Justice League artist 
Kevin Maguire and are quite 
appealing to the eye. Please, give 
this fish story a chance.
Well Santa, there is my notso-long list of books for Christ
mas. I hope I have made the 
point that there is more at stake
here than sheer comic book en
joyment. The fate of the enslaved 
depend on your getting these 
books to me for the holidays. So 
long and see you soon.
P.S. Important Announce
ment! Hey listen up comic read
ers! Want to fight the Power in 
your own way? The comic book 
store Phantom of the Attic on 
South Craig Street is in the final 
days of a wonderful food drive! 
Bring some canned foods (even 
one can) to the store and feel the 
warmth of holiday cheer. If the 
good feelings of helping out the 
poor isnt enough for you, Phan
tom is giving a mammoth 40 
percent off back-issues and other 
huge discounts for helping the 
world out. However, this drive 
ends tomorrow, so stock up on 
some back-issues for Thanks
giving reading and feed the poor 
at the same time!
