CMU rekeys 
new dorm
By JASON MCDONALD
Tartan Assistant Sports Editor
Due to the loss of the master keys to 
the new dorm, the Housing Office has 
replaced the locks in all rooms in 
Resnik House and the West Wing.
In a letter to new dorm residents, 
Director of Housing Tony Martin said, 
Even though there is no evidence 
that someone stole the master keys 
deliberately to steal from resident 
students, I feel strongly that we can
not hesitate in doing whatever we can 
to assure residents of their security.
We still dont feel the keys have 
fallen into the wrong hands, said
Assistant Director of Housing for 
Residence Life Amy Ginther, but since 
we cant determine that to be a fact, 
we had to replace the locks. 
According to Ginther, the keys were 
confirmed as being missing just after 
winter break. Three keys were lost in 
allthe master keys for Resnik House 
and the West Wing, as well as the key 
for the desk drawers.
We can pinpoint a specific hour 
when the keys were left unattended, 
said Ginther. The keys were not 
available when the next attendant 
came on duty.
The master keys were lost despite a

Carnegie Mellon does basic military research
Editors note: The Tartan has 
discovered that information 
printed in last weeks article, 
fCMU engages in war research 
was incorrect.
Unlike the article stated, CMU 
engaged in no classified research, 
W did it program a productionready scheduling system for 
battlefield command in the Time 
'Phase Forced Deployment
Scheduler project completed by the 
Robotics Institute in September. 
Also, students were not forced to 
work 071 any particular project.
Much of the information was 
attributed to an unnamed student, 
and was not confirmed by inde
pendent sources, as it should have 
been. The Tartan regrets any 
damage caused by its inaccurate 
reporting.

Since the war in the Persian 
Gulf began, concern has increased 
over Carnegie Mellons role in 
military research. One project 
which has received attention in
volves the U.S. Transportation 
Command, which plans trans
portation for the military around
the world.
In February 1989, the Defense 
Advanced Research Project 
Agency (DARPA), which has 
funded University projects over 
the years, asked the Robotics In
stitute for scheduling ideas and 
. their applications to the U.S. 
Transportation Command.
According to Director of the 
Center for Integrated Manufac
turing Decision Systems Mark 
Fox, the project was an outgrowth 
of the divisions focus on manu
facturing research. Im being paid 
to find better ways to make 
scheduling for factories, said Fox, 
citing CMUs prominence in 
knowledge-based scheduling 
techniques.
Given you haye an organization 
like a factory, you have an enor
mous amount of resources and a 
lot of activities to be done with 
this stuff ... and they all have 
time constraints, said systems 
scientist Steve Roth.

Student Senate votes to support Greek Sing
fey DAVID LADEK
Tartan News Editor
Student Senate voted to provide 
funding for Greek Sing at its meeting on 
February 13. The Senate approved a 
grant for the Greek Sing comto use toward this years event, 
to Greek Sing Chair ElizaStuetz, The money will help cover
the costs of printing programs, advertis
ing, and security for the event.
At its February 11 meeting, the Senate 
Finance and Recognition committee 
heard the petition of Stuetz, and the 
committee made a preliminary approval 
of the funding request.
It was then brought up at the Senate  
meeting on February 13, and the Senate 
approved the measure, said Stuetz.
[The Greek Sing Committee] has ap
proached us for two or three years, said 
Student Senate Chair Chris Neighbor.
Stuetz said that after Kappa Alpha 
Thetas Mr. Fraternity contest received 
funding last semester, it was worth trying 
for Greek Sing funding again. I simply 
came with an itemized list of what we 
wanted the money for, and stated my 
case to them, she said. They were very
cooperative, and passed the measure. 
Previously, the committee has asked 
for funding for items like trophies and 
other materials that Senate doesnt 
usually fund, said Neighbor. This time, 
though, the money is being used for 
publicity and security, which are items 
that every event needs, and Senate 
usually funds. We have also altered our 
fiscal policy by recognizing the fratemities and sororities this year, and have 
funded events like Mr. Fraternity. 
Therefore, we felt that they deserved to 
get the money.
Although the money is but a small 
fraction of the funds used by Greek Sing 
this year, every little bit will help, ac
cording to Stuetz. We are very pleased 
and thankful to Senate for the help theyre 
giving us.

Last July, Student Government 
President Kishore Rao submitted 
a proposal to President Mehrabian 
calling for the establishment of a 
free fifth-year study program at 
Carnegie Mellon. An announce
ment accepting the proposal is 
expected this week.
The administration has been 
very receptive to the proposal,
said Rao, pointing out that it 
seems to have been accepted by 
the steering committee. The 
committee consists of Provost 
Angel Jordan, H&SS Dean 
Stephen Fienberg, Vice President 
for Enrollment William Elliott, 
and Dean of Student Affairs 
Michael Murphy.
Although President Mehrabian 
is not a member of the committee, 
he has on a number of occasions 
said that he supported the program, Rao said.
The focus of the program is to 
allow qualified students to 
broaden their experiences by 
having the opportunity to study 
and participate in activities that 
they otherwise would not have 
time to schedule in a four-year 
program.
According to the plan, the 
members of the current junior 
class will be eligible to apply.

The CMU chapter of Students For Peace sponsored its first rally for peace outside Skibo on Thursday. An estimated 200 people, 
including Erica Bocella, gathered to hear a dozen speakers, Including CMU and Pitt students and community peace activists. 
Students held signs such as Use brains not armies" and Save our troops and Treasury." Sophomore Mark Page burned his 
selective service card in front of the crowd. The rally was interrupted briefly by a group of students who ran through the crowd 
shouting USA! The crowd cheered as the speaker responded, When the draft comes theyll be running to these meetings. 
After two hours, the group marched to Pitt and later participated in a candlelight walk back to CMU.
CMDS pinches 
to meet budget
By LAURIE WILKISON
Tartan Assistant News Editor
Carnegie Mellon Dining Service 
announced on February 21 that sev
eral actions will be taken to insure its 
ability to meet all its financial obli
gations by the end of this fiscal year, 
June 30.
According to Jim Gurley, director of 
CMDS, a projected revenue shortfall 
of almost 5.5 percent, combined with 
increasing operating costs and the 
construction costs of the Highlander 
Cafe, have necessitated the upcoming 
changes.
According to Gurley, there are about 
250 less people on meal plans than 
Dining Service had projected from past 
trends. This is a significant shortfall 
of money, said Gurley. Were really 
tightening our belt to break even this 
year.
CMDS looked at all facets of the
program in an attempt to provide the 
most demanded services in more costeffective ways. As a result, changes 
have been made in the schedule of 
operations for the MorePizza and 
Morewood Gardens facilities.
Due to low customer volume, the 
service at MorePizza during lunch as 
well as on Friday and Saturday eve
nings is being curtailed. In addition, 
Morewood Gardens, which had re
cently been closed for Friday night 
dinner, will be reopened. Morewood 
Gardens will now offer continuous 
service throughout the day from 11 
am until 7 pm.
Some people are going to be an
noyed, said Gurley, but we must do 
this rather than carry a deficit forward 
and annoy a lot more people. 
MorePizza delivery will be replaced 
with a new program through Dominos 
Pizza. Dominos will honor all Campus

THIS JUST INP Pl
U.S., allies invade Iraq
SAUDI ARABIA (DJ)  The troops 
are doing a great job. Thats General 
Norman Schwarzkqpfs assessment of 
the first hours of the ground war in the 
Gulf.
The commander of allied forces in the 
Gulf reports his forces have already 
reached all of their first-day objectives 
for the ground campaign. He says pre
liminary reports from the battlefield in
dicate the Iraqis are hardly putting up a 
fight. He describes allied casualties as 
remarkably light. He also says more 
than 5000 Iraqis have been captured.
While Schwarzkopf says hes delighted 
with the allies progress so far, he warns 
the war is not over yet.
He wont predict how long it will last.
Schwarzkopf will only say that the fight
ing will continue until the Iraqis get out 
of Kuwait.
The general wont say anything about 
the location of troops. He says he doesnt 
want to reveal anything that might jeop
ardize the progress of the operation or 
endanger the lives of his troops. However, 
a senior American military official in 
Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, reports allied 
troops have reached the southern and 
western edges of Kuwait City.
A Kuwait; news agency report even 
says theyve seized control of the Kuwaiti 
capital. There is no way to verify that 
claim.
Iraq is telling a very different version 
of the war story. A military communique
broadcast on Iraqi radio reports theres 
been fierce fighting and the allied offen
sive has failed utterly.
The statement boasts the scoundrels 
of aggressors are crying for help and 
swimming in their blood. It also accuses 
the allies of concealinginformation about 
their losses.
Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein is urging 
his troops to show no mercy. He spoke 
in a brief radio address on Saturday.
Saddam has warned hell unleash his 
chemical and biological weapons on the 
allied forces. Schwarzkopf says that 
hasnt happened yet. While there have 
been some reports of chemical weapons 
being used, the general dismisses those 
stories as bogus.
Rebuilding Kuwait will cost billions
RIYADH (D J)  Iraqi troops have woven themselves into 
the very fabric of the facilities of Kuwait City, according to 
Marine Brigadier General Richard Neal.
Theyre using civilians to their advantage, in other words, 
as a shield or protection, Neal said. Theyve occupied schools, 
theyve occupied the tops of hotels, theyve occupied religious 
sites, they have moved into residential areas.
I think theyre well ensconced in the entire fabric of the 
Kuwait City environment, the general added. The Iraqis 
have done major damage to Kuwait City and elsewhere in 
Kuwait since invading the nation August 2, and the post-war 
repair bill is expected to be huge.
The Kuwaitis plan to undertake an emergency, 90-day 
program to restore essential services in their country after the 
Iraqis leave or are ejected.
Their projected $800 million cost for this first phase is
considered low by Western diplomatic observers.
The Kuwaitis say estimating the longer-run costs of rebuild
ing their country must await on-scene assessment of damages. 
But they acknowledge the reconstruction will cost many 
billions of dollars, and say it could take up to five years to put 
Kuwait back together.
At last word, the Kuwaitis had signed 171 contracts for a 
variety of reconstruction-related services. American firms 
have been awarded about 70 percent of the contracts, the 
Kuwaitis report.
If the Iraqis have to be ejected from Kuwait City by force, the 
damage and the cost of repairing it is expected to be much 
larger. According to U.S. military authorities, the Iraqis have 
entrenched themselves in Kuwait City to such an extent that 
major additional damage will be unavoidable if street fighting 
is needed to eject Iraqi troops from Kuwait City.
Iran builds up 
military forces
NICOSIA (AP)While the military 
power of Irans old enemy Iraq is being 
systematically destroyed by the U.S.- 
led allies in the Persian Gulf war, the 
Islamic repnblicis rebuildingits armed 
forces.
But the Iranian military establish
ment, driven for years by friction be
tween the Islamic Revolutionary 
Guards Corps and the regular forces, 
isnt likely to pose athreat in the region 
for some time to come, at least five 
years, according to one analyst.
Since its August, 1988, cease-fire with 
Iraq, Iran has been restructuring its 
military and acquiring new weapons. 
Iranian officials have said these include 
a squadron of Soviet MiG-29 intercep
tors and batteries of SA-6 Gainful sur
face-to-air missiles.
But Tehran is still believed to be 
short of tanks, heavy artillery, armored 
fighting vehicles, and comprehensive 
air defense systems.
Central to the military program is 
integrating the Guards Corps, which 
has its own naval and air wings, with 
the regular armed forces, at least at 
commandlevel and in logistics support.
On the face of it, the Guards will be 
the dominant element in Irans newlook military.
It looks very much like the Guards 
are consolidating their position and in 
effect taking over the army, said Doit1 
Kerr, a military analyst with Londons 
International Institute for Strategic 
Studies.
In October 1989, Irans supreme 
leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, nami 
former Revolutionary Guards Minisl 
Ah Shamkhani as navy command) 
and promoted him to Rear Admiral.
That was the first time a Guards 
officer had been put in charge of a 
regular armed forces formation.
The Guards naval division and the ' 
navy were merged last December under 
Shamkhani.
Rafsanjani particularly seeks to re
inforce the navy as an instrument of' 
power projection in the Persian Gulf 
and beyond.
Shamkhani said recently that tie 
navy will acquire submarines, new1 
aircraft, and anti-ship missiles from' 
both eastern and western countries.
Both the Guards and the regular 
army, each jealous of their own identi
ties, have resisted themtegrationmov'es 
that began soon after the war 
Iraq.
Bush administration introduces national energy strategy
WASHINGTON (DJ)  The 
National Energy Strategy just 
completed by the Bush adminis
tration envisions more, not less, 
dependence on oil from the Middle 
East.
Our nation and the world are 
likely to depend more on Middle 
East oil suppliers under any real
istic scenario for the foreseeable 
future, the report said, although 
adding that the energy plan is 
intended to make the U.S. less 
prone to oil supply and price 
fluctuations.
The plan includes measures to 
increase domestic production, 
particularly in Arctic National 
Wildlife Refuge and in certain ar
eas in the Outer Continental 
Shelf, to encourage increased 
production in countries outside 
the Middle East, to streamline 
gas pipeline construction, to re
form nuclear power plant licens
ing and to evaluate possible in
creases in the corporate average 
fuel economy of the nations mo
tor vehicles.
The administrations energy 
strategy is expected to decrease 
U.S. oil consumption by 1.3 mil
lion barrels per day below the 
projected level for the year 2000, 
and by 3.4 barrels per day below 
projected 2010 levels, largely be
cause of displacement of oil by 
alternative fuels, such as alcohol, 
in motor vehicles.
As alternative fuels become 
more cost-competitive, the report 
said, fuel-flexible and altemativefuel vehicles will erode 
petroleums dominant role in the 
transportation sector.
In introducing the plan, Energy 
Secretary Watkins said that in 
conjunction with the Clean Air 
Act passed last year, the changes 
in oil use by the transportation 
sector could help reduce oil use by 
1.5 million barrels per day by 2005
and by 3 million barrels per day 
by 2010.
But at the same time, the strat
egy could help increase domestic 
oil production by 1.8 million bar
rels per day above the levels pro
jected for the year 2000, mostly 
because of advanced oil recovery 
technologies, the report said. By 
2010, domestic oil production 
could be augmented by possibly 
as many as 3.8 million barrels per 
day, it said.
President Bush, who joined 
Watkins in introducing the 
strategy, said that the plan will 
put America on, the road to eco
nomic growth. He said that he 
viewed the plan as a delicate 
balance between energy conser
vation and increased production.
Echoing Watkinss earlier 
statements that the plan 
shouldnt be expected to aim for 
U.S. energy independence, he said 
America will continue to have to
import energy for years to come. 
He said that imports are currently 
about 42 percent of consumption, 
after hitting a high of about 50 
percent at the outset of the Gulf 
war. We are a long way from 
total energy independence, he 
added.
Bush said he doesnt see the 
need for heavy restrictions on 
imports, which would hurt 
American consumers and jobs. 
Instead, he said that the plan 
looks to more reliable sources of 
energy, including domestic oil and 
gas as well as alternative sources.
The presidents energy plan 
received mixed reviews from leg
islators leaving the White House. 
While most said that it was a good 
start, some argued that it should 
have placed more emphasis on 
conservation and efficiency.
Senators J. Bennett Johnston 
(D-La.) and Malcolm Wallop (RWyo.) the chairman and ranking
minority members of the Senate 
Energy and Natural Resources 
Committee, respectively, have 
presented a comprehensive strat
egy of their own. Although their 
proposal relies more on efficiency 
and conservation than does the 
Bush plan, they said the 
presidents strategy was a good 
package.
But Johnston added that in 
crafting his bill, he took into ac
count that environmentalists 
shouldnt have to swallow the 
opening of Arctic wilderness to 
drilling without having some sort 
of strong efficiency and conser
vation measures, indicating that 
Bushs plan might face fierce en
vironmental opposition as crafted.
Rep. Philip Sharp (D-Ind.), who 
introduced a series of energy bills 
earlier this session, also empha
sized that Bush needed stronger 
elements on the conservation 
side.
Rep. John Dingell, (D-MicL) 
chairman of the House Energy, 
and Commerce committee, said 
that although the plan is a 
beginning, he expects to see 
changes to it when it comes before 
his committee, partially with re
gard to greater conservation 
measures. Dingell is a co-sponsor 
of several of Sharps proposals.
The plan will have to move 
through several House and Sen
ate committees, floor votes in both 
the House and the, Senate, and 
joint conference committee before 
coming out of Congress as a final 
bill to be signed. Legislators hope 
to finish the strategy sometime 
this year.

American people face ever-increasing censorship
ER PleasP slPLO
Tartan News Editor
Censorship, as deTARTAN
fined by Project CenNEWS
red at Sonoma ANALYSIS
,te University, is
,e suppression of information, whether 
purposeful or not, by any method  
jiicluding bias, omission, under-reportiijg,or self-censorship.
.por example, a college newspaper gets 
sijiut down because of several items it 
pj-ints, and books ^are removed from liu-ary shelves at public schools because 
tftey teach the wrong thing. A student 
expelled because of things he say s out 
d. Compact discs are removed from 
:ord stores because of obscene language 
iij the songs.
Every year, there are dozens of impor
tant stories that the mass media ignore, 
said broadcast journalist Bill Moyers, 
known best for his television documen
taries on many subjects. They show up 
mainly in small publications.... They 
expose shady conduct by high officials... 
they uncover hidden dangers and warn 
of crises to come.
Lately, in the newspaper, on TV, and 
even in the local record store, items that 
four or five years ago would have seemed 
justdistasteful are being looked atclosely. 
People in the government, activist 
groups, and even PTAs are taking a 
closer look at what the rest of us see, 
read, and listen to, and are making deci
sions about what we will and will not be 
able to see legally. This has been a grow
ing trend over the past few years.
For the past 15 years, a group at 
Sonoma State University called Project
Censored, directed by Dr. Carl Jensen, 
has brought attention to dozens of sto
ries that seldom receive mainstream at
tention. They stress the fact that we 
should all be aware of what we arent 
being told. For example:
The University of Pittsburgh Campus 
Security has started to withold access to 
the crime reports from Pitt. Unlike the 
old system, students no longer have ac
cess to them, and The Pitt News is no 
longer allowed to print selected crime 
reports in their paper. This has raised 
questions for the past few weeks.
Denver Universitys student paper, The 
Clarion, has been in existence for almost 
100 years, but just last week arose from 
a nine-month hiatus. The newspaper had 
been shut down after printing several 
sexist and racist jokes last year. (Among 
them, statements like Youve come a
long way, babynow go back where you 
belong.) Denver Universitys student 
media board voted to shut the paper 
down after the incident; one week later, 
the paper published its last issue prior to 
the hiatus.
A Brown University student was ex
pelled in January for making several 
comments during an October incident. 
He was expelled under a new Brown rule 
that forbids what has come to be called 
hate speech. A drunk 21-year-old stu
dent yelling obsenities and racial epi
thets is one thing, but saying that the 
content of his speech was not permissable 
goes against every principle that the 
United States was founded on.
Several years ago, parents groups at
tempted to get several books banned 
from school libraries, and in some cases 
they succeded. The books, which in
cluded Huckleberry Finn and The Scar
let Letter, were banned for showing the 
wrong kind of carefree living and be
cause of descriptions of witchcraft. 
Moyers said, Knowing about [censored 
stories like these] could change our lives
 or maybe even save them.
Even now, the government is censor
ing news  news coming back from the 
Persian Gulf about the war. In the in
terests of national security, they tell us. 
Nevertheless, thenews is being censored
 cut off before we, the public, can see it. 
The First Amendment to the United
States constitution states, Congress 
shall make no law ... abridging the free
dom of speech, or of the press.... This 
amendment is the basis for many of the 
freedoms that Americans take for 
granted. Recent events have seemed to 
show that that freedom may be dying.
(bMU groups sponsor 
discussions about war
There will be a discussion on the Persian Gulf war Tuesday 
4:30 pm in Breed Hall (Margaret Morrison 103). The discusm, entitled Where Did the Problem Begin? War in the Gulf: 
iBaikground Issues, features Richard Cottam, an emeritus 
bfofessor in political science at the University of Pittsburgh. Dr. 
jqottam is currently researching the application of international 
relations theory in the Middle East. This event is the first in a 
ines of informal talks by CMU and area faculty to explore the 
fjersian Gulf conflict. The event is partially funded by the Gradujafe Students Organization and the Activities Fee, and is sponBjired by CMU Students for Peace and CMU Faculty, Staff, and

strict security policy. The desk 
attendants are never to leave the 
keys unattended. If their replace
ment doesnt show up, they are to 
call someone to fill in ... either 
another attendant or their imme
diate supervisor, she said. Ifthey 
cant find a replacement, theyre 
supposed to take the keys to the 
Housing Office, or to Campus 
Police as a final default.
The attendant who was respon
sible for the keys appeared in 
front of a Residence Hall Judicial 
Board on February 15. According 
to Ginther, the meeting served a 
dual purpose, assessing the 
attendants level of responsibility 
as well as revealing any additional 
information about the keys. The 
Board recommended holding the 
attendant responsible, and the 
attendant was later removed from 
the job.
There was a question of whether the 
attendant could locate the keys. 
 Amy Ginther; 
_________assistant director of housing
According to Martins letter, 
The desk attendant appeared to 
act irresponsibly in failing to care 
properly for the master keys, and 
that student is no longer working 
as a desk attendant.
The Housing Office waited al
most a month before notifying 
students. There was a question 
of whether the attendant could 
locate the keys, said Ginther. 
He had fuzzy information [about 
where the keys might be], so there 
was a possibility we could still 
find them.
The replacement of the locks
has been a relatively smooth pro
cess. Students will only end up 
making two stops at the desk  
one to pick up the new suite door 
key and one [today] to turn in 
their old keys, said Ginther.
To avoid a repeat of this situa
tion, Martin stressed the respon
sibility of the desk attendants in 
his letter. Steps will be taken to 
stress to desk attendants their 
high level of responsibility for the 
security of the residence halls, 
he wrote, and hopefully situa
tions like this one will not reocF9kw dU :DfUf:dk Uf~9H

Carnegie Mellon performs basic research
RESEARCH, from page 1
rage in mission-oriented reirch but rather basic research, 
Pox pointed out that CMUs infolvement in the project did not 
jelude creating production-ready 
software. We built a prototype 
unething that demonstrates 
eas, he said, also stressing the 
act that the project has no direct 
to the war in the Gulf as it 
vas created well before any indiations of problems in that area. 
When the prototype was comjleted, The ideas that were pre
sented were so intriguing to 
iDARPA] they funded another 
jonipany to build something based 
jn.those ideas, Fox explained. 
Whether they ever actually use 
he ideas is unclear.
This is a fundamental point 
tressed last week by Assistant 
rovost Joanna Guziewicz. 
[CMU] does very basic research, 
low it is eventually used is not 
omething we have control over.
Additionally, said Fox, We 
dont do classified research, nor 
do we have classified material  
I dont have any classification 
status  and being Canadian 
doesnt help, he joked. If this 
was a classified facility you 
wouldnt be able to just walk in 
here. We cant do that kind of 
stuff and were not interested in 
that kind of stuff, said Fox.
Were not a production facil
ity, added Roth. Were for pro
ducing new ideas. These ideas, 
he pointed out, are totally new 
and may prove to be unusable. 
For this reason, according to Fox, 
DoD would never trust us to do 
mission-related work.
Nevertheless, according to Jor
dan, There is no question that 
some of the work done by Carn
egie Mellon has been utilized by 
the military for weapons systems. 
Yet, for those in the Robotics In
stitute who may feel uncomfort
able with the possibility that their
work may in some way be used by 
the military, No one is forced  
they have ample opportunity to 
change projects, said Roth.
Less than 10 percent of the 
scheduling work that we do is for 
DARPA, said Roth, and thus 
there is a fair choice for under
graduates who feel uncomfortable 
with certain projects. We try to 
find a good match with people, 
he said, pointing out that the other 
researchers freely choose their 
own research projects.
As described by Jordan last 
week, many departments receive 
fundingfrom the government. The 
most obvious is CMUs semi-autonomous Software Engineering 
Institute (SEI), which receives 100 
percent of its funding from the 
DoD to research software tech
nology as well as technology 
transfer  which is the maximi
zation of technology that already 
exists so that it may be used more
Less than ten percent of the sched
uling work that we do is for DARPA."
 Steve Roth, 
systems scientist
versities, etc., he said.
However, he pointed out that, 
as with all of CMUs research, 
SEI doesnt do mission-oriented 
research. That, he said, is a func
tion of independent companies 
which uses that research.
According to Jordan, major 
government agencies with inter
ests in CMU include: DARPA, 
which has funded many basic 
projects in computer science and 
materials science; the Office of 
Naval Research, which funds ba
sic research in material science, 
physics, electrical engineering,
Research and the Army Research 
Office, which for many years have 
had similar interests.
Furthermore, added Jordan, the 
Department of Psychology has 
also received funding from DoD, 
for cognitive science research.
All of these projects involve ba
sic research, and, as pointed out 
by Guziewicz, If the Psychology 
Department studies how people 
learn to read, that can be used by
the government to better train 
soldiers  but thats not the in
tended purpose.
According to Roth, You cant 
do anything that can be useful to 
an office worker that cant be used 
by the military, he said. Theyre 
a subculture; there are millions of 
them [of all professions], and 
because of the variety of func
tions the military performs and 
people they involve, he said, 
Their needs are as basic as many 
school districts.
For those interested in CMU 
research projects, they are all 
documented and a matter of pub
lic record and obtainable through 
the University. Were an open 
institution. Nothing is secret, 
thats clear, said Roth.

CMDS makes changes to fight budget woes
BUDGET, from page 1
ccount (e.g. Validine) holders, both on 
campus and off campus (in the North 
Craig St. Dominos service area), start
ing on March 5.
Additional plans for installing 
Dominos Pizza hot lines in Morewood 
Gardens and the Tartan Lounge are 
currently being considered, according to 
Gurley.
Gurley said that while they were 
looking to cut the least used services,
CMDS couldnt rely solely on these cuts 
to balance the budget. CMDS announced 
plans to reduce its managerial and hourly 
workforce and restructure job assign
ments. Two recently hired managers have 
been laid off. Gurley said he regrets the 
move but that he is confident the indi
vidual rights of everyone involved have 
been respected. He also said, The lay
offs were a direct result of the changes in 
operations.
According to CMDS, reduced summer
We must do this rather than carry a deficit 
forward and annoy a lot more people.  
 Jim Gurley; 
director of CMDS
operations, the reallocation of several 
internal charges for services, and more 
economic purchasing comprise the re
mainder of the deficit avoidance strat
egy. Gurley said it has been a traumatic 
year adjusting to the new Highlander
Cafe, the Kiltie Court, and the plans for 
a new food court that will be going into 
the new University Center when it is 
built.
The decision to implement these ini
tiatives was approved by the university 
administration and was announced to 
students at the SDC Food Committee 
meeting on February 21. The changes go 
into effect immediately after mid-semester break and new hours of operation will 
be announced this week.

getting money from both Student

ing the F&R Committee the 
money received from Student Af
fairs is for one purpose, while 
telling Student Affairs it is for 
another. There seems to be some 
sort of miscommunication going 
on. As a result, F&R would like a 
list of all the activities which are 
funded by Student Affairs. Dean
Murphy should meet with the

Do we have the money to take

or Spring Carnival Committee 
next year, or will it be budgeted? 
It is up to Greek Council whether 
they come before us for event

If Senate would look closely at 
its Fiscal Policy, it would discover 
item 14, which clearly states that 
students Activities Fees will not 
be given to charity: Events which 
donate their proceeds to charity 
will not be funded by the Activities 
Fee.
After locating the item in the 
policy, the committee should re
alize that its a good policy.
Unfortunately, at last 
Wednesdays meeting, Senate 
chose to pay more attention to 
item 23, which says that the 
Funding and Recognition Com
mittee can override the fiscal 
policy with a two-thirds vote, and 
voted to subsidize Greek Sing with 
$1,753 this year.
The reasoning behind the fund
ing, according to Brad Wyatt, co
chair of Senates Funding and 
Recognition committee, is that 
Greek Sing involves so many 
students, as either participants 
or spectators, that it deserves 
Student Senate funding.
Students may be involved, but 
they dont benefit from the Senate 
subsidy. The charity, in this case 
the Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, 
benefits, and that isnt what the 
Activities Fee is for.
At first glance, Senates decision 
seems like a good idea. Greeks are 
working hard to put on a show 
and give the Pittsburgh Cancer 
Institute a helping hand.
But take a second look. The 
Greeks are not donating just the 
money earned from selling tickets; 
they are also donating the $1,753 
Senate gave them.
Were not against giving money 
to charities. What we oppose is 
the wrong money going to the right 
place.
If students or their parents want 
to give to the Pittsburgh Cancer 
Institute, they cam make out a 
check and mail it downtown. When 
they make out a check every se
mester for their Activities Fee, 
students expect to see their money 
used on campus.
When students sanctioned a $10 
Activities Fee raise in November, 
Senate promised them that the 
money would be put to good use.
We can give out monies based 
on what groups asked for in the 
past and allow for new organiza
tions as well, said Assistant Dean 
of Student Affairs Anne Witchner 
in November. I think that the 
$10 a semester will definitely have 
a positive effect.
Greek Sing happens without 
Senate funding. It always has in 
the past, as this is the first year 
Senate has ever subsidized the 
event. The benefit to the students 
will be the same this year as in the 
past  only the charity feels the 
effects of the extra $1,753.
This years decision to fund an 
event whose proceeds go directly 
to a charity blatantly disregards 
the reason for the Activities Fee, 
and represents a breach of trust 
between Senate and the student 
body.
Wyatts opinion is that Senate 
has such a high turnover that some 
Senators dont know much about 
traditional CMU events, such as 
Spring Carnival and Greek Sing, 
which makes funding decisions 
difficult.
Senate needs to understand the 
nature of campus organizations 
and events, as well as what the 
Activities Fee is for. Sit down and 
read the fiscal policy, especially 
item 14.

Shortly after the winter break, 
the master keys to the new dorm 
were discovered missing. Febru
ary 18, a month later, residents 
received a memo that the keys 
were missing and that the locks in 
Resnik House and the West Wing 
would be replaced.
Even though there is no evi
dence that someone stole the 
master keys to deliberately steal 
from resident students, I feel 
strongly that we cannot hesitate 
doing whatever we can to assure 
residents of their security, said 
Director of Housing Tony Martin.
Well, Mr. Martin, that is exactly 
what you did. You and your staff 
hesitated. You stalled. You re
sponded sluggishly to a situation 
that demanded immediate atten
tion.
You sidestepped your obligation 
to insure students safety.
The desk attendant who was on 
duty when the keys were stolen 
certainly owns much of the blame. 
But with a problem of such a large 
scale, the responsibility sits right 
at the top.
Assistant Director of Housing 
for Residence Life Amy Ginther 
said the Housing Office didnt 
think the keys fell into the wrong 
hands.
It doesnt matter where your 
office thinks the keys wound up, 
Mr. Martin. When the stakes are 
that high, you have to know. If you 
dont know, assume the worst, and
act accordingly.
Keys were stolen  keys that 
gave the thief access to students 
rooms. For a month, students se
curity, as well as the security of 
their possessions, was compro
mised, just in case the keys might 
turn up. When it comes to stu
dents safety, there is no room for 
hedging.
Sure, it costs a lot of money to 
replace locks and issue keys to 
residents. But that costis minimal 
compared to losses that could have 
resulted from crime.
And, sure, it would be a big 
money saver if during the time 
Housing put off getting new locks 
and keys the old keys turned up, 
but thats simply a risk not worth 
taking.
Even if the original keys had 
been discovered, new locks and 
keys would still have been neces
sary, since copies of the keys could 
have been made. Its all a part of 
not taking chances.
No risks are worth taking when 
it comes to security. Every time a 
DA neglects to look up from his or 
her homework to see who is 
trailing through the door, and 
every time a DA buzzes in people 
because they forgot their student 
ID, security is being compromised.
While every person who trickles 
through ID-less isnt an axe mur
derer, its much better to assume 
the worst than regret not doing so 
after it happens.
r > I RESNIK HOUjjFLetters to the Editor
Analysis of IFC chairmen 
lacks adequate research
Editor:on
Letter to 
the Editor
Everyone is entitled 
to their own opinions.
However, when the 
decision is made to 
write a column stating 
facts and claiming accurate knowledge, 
there comes with it a responsibility to be 
correct in the printed statements. This 
responsibility wasnt met in Howdy 
Pierces column last week [IFCs Ireland 
can learn from Pitt brother, 2/18].
If he had bothered to research the 
situation more thoroughly, he would not 
have done exactly what he claims Matt 
Ireland did: Open mouth, insert foot. 
Well, Howdy, it happened to you this 
time! If Mr. Pierce had taken the time to 
check some of his facts, he would have 
found out that the Inter-fraternity 
Council (IFC) does in fact have a Social 
Chairman who is responsible for regu
lating social policies and activities for 
the fraternity system. By not calling or 
coming to see me for information, he 
could only present a warped and incor
rect picture of the situation.
In line with current social trends, we 
as a fraternity system are taking the 
initiative and researching methods to 
lessen if not eradicate emphasis on al
cohol. In fact, one house, Alpha Epsilon 
Pi, has completely eliminated alcohol 
from its house activities. Other houses 
on campus are also taking steps to ad
dress alcohol awareness. They are plan
ning alternative methods to their current 
party system, examining such options as 
closed parties and a bring your own 
beverage (B.Y.O.B) policy.
Mr. Pierce is also incorrect as to his 
assumptions about how B.Y.O.B. may 
work on this campus. Preliminary dis
cussion on the matter indicates that a 
B.Y.O.B. policy will most likely come 
directly from IFC and therefore impose 
the same regulations on all of the fra
ternities. Thus, if we decide that nothing 
but beer should be allowed at parties, 
then that regulation will be strictly en
forced. Another positive aspect of 
B.Y.O.B. is that, since people would be 
required to bring their own beverage, 
only those 21 years old should be in 
possession of alcohol.
Another fallacy portrayed in the col
umn is that we are sitting around wait
ing for the gods on Mount Warner to 
hand down the 10 Ways to Solve Alcohol 
Liability. Rather, IFC is currently en
gaged in active, almost unprecedented 
discussions concerning the issuewith 
the participation of Student Affairs and 
Campus Police to determine the most 
effective approach to the alcohol situa
tion. In addition, we are looking into 
hiring a lawyer to come speak and advise 
the fraternity system on our responsi
bilities, the liabilities involved, possible 
future actions, and ways to make our 
social events safer.
We are doing this voluntarily because, 
similar to Mr. McMullen at Pitt, we do 
not want anything forced upon us, and 
hopefully our initiative will result in a 
safer and more responsible atmosphere.
Since we are all adults, as Mr. Pierce so 
eloquently pointed out, eradication of a 
persons choice to drink alcohol should 
neither be my responsibility nor the re
sponsibility of the fraternity system as a 
whole. However, it is our responsibility
to make our social events as safe as they 
can be for everyone involved  and that 
is the end we are now trying to achieve.
This letter represents my views and 
those of IFC.

Protestor directs her 
attention to Theta Xi
Editor:
As one of the pro
testors outside of Theta 
Xi on Saturday, Feb
ruary 16,1 would like 
to respond to Rich 
Robinsons article on
on
Letter to 
the Editor
Refreshing Pro
tests [Protests refresh stale thoughts 
of CMU students 2/18]. First, I would 
like to thank him for supporting  en
thusiastically  our right to free speech.
More importantly, I would like to pro
vide clarification for him, and his read
ers, on the point of the demonstration. 
We were not say[ing] that all fraterni
ties are a bunch of sexists. Rather, we 
were targeting a specific fraternity, 
Theta Xi, for a specific reason: the circu
lation of posters that portrayed women 
in an objectionable and demeaning man
ner. Instead of letting these posters slide 
by  and thus implicitly granting them 
our approval  we preferred to call at
tention to them. Perhaps some members 
of Theta Xi were, as they claimed, un
aware of the sexist implications of their 
actions. What better reason is there for 
directing their attention to them?
I would like to provide some of the 
responses our protest generated; per
haps Rich Robinson and others who were 
near the fraternity quad that night can 
recall them as well. One Theta Xi brother, 
when told he needed to work on [sexist 
assumptions within his house], re
sponded, Yeah, well work on our girl
friends. Another fraternity began 
chanting something about lesbians 
needing strap-ons. A third fraternity 
got on a loudspeaker and screamed,  1,
2, 3, 4 ... SUCK OUR DICKS! Our pro
test was in no way meant to imply that 
all-encompassing sexism exists among 
fraternities, or even within specific 
houses. The responses by those who felt 
threatened by our refusal to submit to 
sexist and insulting representations in
dicate otherwise.

CMU avoids Gulf stand, 
discourages free speech
Editor:
Scotland Yard was

wall, and everyone was 
dancing. Rusted Root,
Osi
Letter to 
the Editor
possibly the best band in Pittsburgh, 
played a long and extremely energetic 
set. I am glad that they did play in this 
intimate setting, but I wanted to write in 
order to comment on the reason that 
they were forced to do so.
The show was originally scheduled 
without a room. Certain CMU students 
tried very hard to get some sort of univer
sity room to have the show. Rusted Root,
after all, is used to playing large clubs 
like the Graffiti. However, they are^sc 
actively involved in the University of  
Pittsburghs Students for Peace organi
zation. My understanding is that !6ur 
University did not wish to seem like they 
were taking a political stand by letting 
them have a room.
This was not a rally, it was not? a 
demonstration, it was not even a lecture.
It was a concert. Not once did anyone 
even say the word war. I could obvidtrly 
go on with this point, but I wont.
It seems to me to be the same misguided 
reasoning that lead Student Senate to 
choke on the referendum to recognize 
the legitimacy of the teach-in at Pitt.!
It is also the same reason that my 
friend Allan Bourdius was removed from 
the Forum section of this paper  the 
desire to not appear to take a political 
side.
This is where I see a basic misundrstanding. I know my politics have been 
misunderstood. Although I can only 
speak for myself, I believe that there are 
others who will agree with what I write.
I have been involved in protests against 
the war. For that, I have been called a 
liberal. I have also been told by bofh 
sides that I cannot support the womn 
and men stationed in the gulf without 
supportingthe policy that put them there.
I have had individuals who call them
selves the old left tell me all about 
they and how it is their fault that we 
are in this war. These people told me 
about how it is the same corporations 
that produce weapons and oil who control,  
the news media. I
It is trae, but this is not the time to 
throw stones. There is no they. You and
I, and everyone who drives a car, owns a 
credit card, or pays taxes is a part of the 
military operation in th Middle East.
As far as I am concerned, you can shove 
your outdated concepts of Right/Left a#d 
Liberal/Conservative. The world is no^ a 
binary place. It is much more compli
cated than any us/them or white-ht/ 
black-hat philosophy. Thats not what I 
base my politics on: they are based on 
humanity and democracy.
Democracy is suppose to be the idea 
that every human in a society is entitled 
to an opinion and a voice about national 
decisions.
Without forums in which to express! 
diverse opinions, there is no room Ito, 
learn about the complex situations that} 
have a bearing on this war.
No matter what the politics of th 
people involved are, there is something 
to be learned from establishing a dia
logue. There is nothing to be learned f>y 
the silence which is bred by a fear to 
offend and disturb.
This policy, adopted by our military, 
must be abandoned immediately by the 
university. I call on the administration 
and Student Senate to take direct action 
to this end  I am sure that someone 
from CMU Students for Peace would be 
glad to talk to you.
No matter what our personal politics 
are, it is our duty as patriotic citizens; of 
a democracy to ask questions and .to. ; 
learn from each other. Furthermore,! it , 
should be the role of the university to 
foster and encourage that education in 
any way that it can.

Parents cantbe exempt from duty
Jonathan Levy
What do you suppose would 
happen if Steelers quarterback 
Bubby Brister announced that 
because of important family 
commitments he would never 
again be able to play on Sundays? 
He would practice during the 
week, but come Sunday he 
wouldnt be there.
The answer is clear. No matter 
^ow talented Brister might be 
and regardless of how pressing 
the family commitments, the 
Steelers would have only one 
choiceto cut Brister as a player.
I It makes no difference how good 
an excuse he has; a quarterback 
who cant work on Sundays is$1,250
virtually useless to an NFL team.
The same is true of a soldier 
whom the military cannot assign 
to a war zone, and Im surprised 
that Senator John Heinz (RPenn.) couldnt see that.
Wednesday the Senate de
feated, 54-38, a Heinz-sponsored 
resolution which asked the Pen
tagon to allow single parents and 
one parent in a military couple to 
leave the Persian Gulf war zone.
Heinz was quoted in the Pitts
burgh Post-Gazette as arguing 
that [U]nder our current Penta
gon policy, children are being 
forced to live with the fear and the 
reality that both their parents  
or the only parent that they have 
 could be killed at war. That is 
a loss that the government cannot 
restore and one that these chil
dren should not have to sustain. 
I cannot dispute that. A lot of
children are going to be hurt by the 
Gulf war and, as wars tend to do, it 
will make orphans on all sides.
I wonder if Heinz looked at the 
alternative, though. If single par
ents and one parent in military 
couples cannot serve in combat 
zones, they are of no more use to 
the military than a six-day-a-week 
Brister is to the Steelers.
The Pentagon would have no 
reasonable choice but to bar single 
parents and one parent in mili
tary families from serving in the 
military, even in peacetime. That 
would end up hurting the same 
children Heinz was trying to 
protect, only in greater numbers.
Military parents have always 
known of the potential risks that 
Heinz spelled out on the Senate 
floor. They also knew that a 
military career would allow them 
to support their families.
Serving in the military is a 
gamble in many ways. If you win, 
as most military parents do, you 
get to provide for your children 
financially without ever having 
to leave them while you go to war. 
If you lose, the price of providing, 
for your children is that they may 
have to grow up without one or 
both of their parents.
Its a tough gamble to make. I 
would not make it if I were a par
ent, but I can see why some people 
would.
I am a white male who is within 
100 days of getting a masters 
degree from a prestigious univer
sity. It is reasonable to expect 
that I will be able to find civilian 
work that will someday allow me 
to provide for my children, either 
in combination with their mother 
or  if need be  alone.
If my situation were such that I
did not expect to be able to sup
port my family and my choices 
were scraping by on public aid or 
joining the military, I suppose I 
would take a second look at the 
gamble. Maybe I would choose to 
take it. Maybe I would still turn it 
down.
The point is that I would weigh 
the benefits and risks, just as 
millions of potential military 
volunteers have done over the 
years and just as it should be.
No actual or potential military 
parent has ever told Heinz what 
line of work to go into in order to 
best take care of his children. Al
though he means well, Heinz 
should not try to make that deci
sion for them.

buys more than jar of Skippy
Jason McDonald
:;The first time they hiked my tuition, I 
didnt really mind. Well, of course, a 
.thousand dollar bump made me a little 
upset, but I could let it slide. After all, the 
much-heralded East Campus project was 
well on its way, and if my dollars meant 
that there would be something between 
Skibo and the sororities other than a big 
pile of dirt, so be it.
Two weeks ago, our loving administra
tion threw another $1,250 log onto the fire. 
For $1,250 that I dont have, Id better see 
a South Campus project pretty damn soon.
Seriously, I dont mind paying alittle extra 
money to the University  once Im above 
the ten grand level, I tend to get a little numb 
about a couple of bills here and there  but 
Id like to see that its doing some good. To 
that end, I have a few suggestions.
How about a new athletic complex, or at 
least renovations on the existing facilities? 
Ive traveled to enough other schools to be 
embarrassed by the disparity between them 
and Carnegie Mellon. Anyone else whos 
ever seen the facilities at Emory, Washing
ton, or New York University would agree 
with me. Sure, it would help our varsity
athletic programs, but, more importantly, 
it would be a benefit to all of our students.
Another idea might be to give it all to 
Physical Plant, just so it can fix all the 
broken things around campus. Elevators, 
drinking fountains, change machines, all 
that sort of stuff. Of course, since these are 
the people who took an entire semester to 
fix the door of Doherty Hall 2315, Im not 
sure extra cash will solve the problem.
A drainage system for our campus side
walks might be a wise investment. Im 
tired of walking through Lake Skibo every 
time it rains around here. Purchasing in
flatable life rafts for all students is a second 
option to consider. On the other hand, if 
theyre going to make environmental im
provements, they might as well just dome 
the entire campus.
Another item that should find its way 
into the budget is a very large tarp. Hope
fully, we can find one big enough to com
pletely cover Donner Hall. As an alterna
tive, we can buy enough TNT to blow the 
monstrosity right off the campus map. 
President Mehrabian can use his discre
tion here  either plan works for me.
On a related note, save on the Skibo 
demolition costs by letting the students 
knock it down. The joy and honor of taking 
a sledgehammer to Grey Matter is some
thing I would pay money for.

Jazz ensemble questions 
director's absence
Editor:
The following letter 
is in response to the 
unexpected leave of 
absence that Randy 
Purcell, director of jazz 
studies at CMU, has taken. It was signed 
by the entire jazz ensemble on Tuesday, 
February 19,1991.
Similar to The Tartan, the jazz en
semble has not been given any informa
tion that would account for this action. 
We realize that a situation may exist 
that prevents the University adminis
tration from answering specific ques
tions; however, we find the lack of in
formation on this issue most distressing 
and very difficult to accept.
We have unsuccessfully attempted to 
speak to Michael Murphy, dean of Stu
dent Affairs, as an ensemble, to explain to 
him that musicians interact on a much 
greater personal level than many other 
disciplines at CMU; the very nature of 
creating music with others requires a great 
deal of trust and respect between both 
director and ensemble. This was accom
plished under Randy Purcells direction. 
As would be expected, an emotional bond 
develops as a result of this deep trust, and 
it is this bond that has developed between 
us and Randy Purcell that compels us to 
continue to inquire into this matter.

Loss of Purcell deals 
harsh blow to CMU jazz
Editor:

We do hereby voice 
our concern regarding 
the recent absence of
onLetter to the Editor
Letter to 
the Editor
Mr. Randy Purcell from his duties as di
rector of jazz studies at Carnegie Mellon. 
We would appreciate the disclosure of 
more information concerning the situa
tion of Mr. Purcells employment at Car
negie Mellon University, or some assur
ance that he will return to his regular 
duties within the near future, if at all 
possible. We fervently support Mr. Purcell 
for a number of reasons, many of which 
are listed below.
First, Mr. Purcell has been pedagogically active at CMU for the past eleven 
years, during which time he has success
fully improved and expanded the jazz 
program. Under Mr. Purcell, the number 
of jazz classes and faculty has increased 
dramatically, ultimately leading to the 
recent decision by the Music Department 
to develop a jazz performance minor  a 
-decision which has been materially sup; ported by the creation of brochures which 
J discuss this option.
Second, Mr. Purcell is a talented band 
; leader with a great deal of practical expe; rience  most importantly his recording 
; and touring experience with the Maynard 
Ferguson band  which he brings with 
him to whatever classroom and band ex. perience he finds himself in. His ability to 
' relate to his students the practical side of 
.the music business makes him far more
 valuable than an educator who can only
 express musical knowledge.
1 Third, Mr. Purcell has regularly taken 
an active interest in his students ca
reers as musicians. Not only does he 
verbally share his experience and
 knowledge with his pupils, but he has on 
many occasions secured work as musi
cians for his students. Add to this 
achievement his active involvement with 
the Billboard song competition, which is 
yet another area in which he has pro
moted student involvement.
Beyond his talents as band leader, 
educator, and mentor, Mr. Purcell has 
made the Carnegie Mellon jazz ensemble 
quite possibly the most popular perform
ing group at the University. The enthu
siasm generated by the jazz ensemble 
can only help the Music Department, 
both in its recruiting efforts and in its 
ability to engender support from the 
members of the Pittsburgh community.
Overall, we hope to have made evident 
both Mr. Purcells value to the Univer
sity and to his students. Our signatures 
will attest to the fact that we feel slighted, 
for we have been robbed of a valuable 
teacher at an inopportune time. Please 
consider our request carefully, for we are 
affected by the loss of Mr. Purcell, a 
teacher whom we hold in high esteem.

Editor:
This will be the 
toughest, most drain
ing and exhausting and 
frustrating job you 
could possibly ever 
have. Problems and hardships seem to 
set you back at every turn, but at the 
same time, every day there is something 
that will absolutely knock you over and 
make you think that there is nothing 
else on this planet which could be quite 
so rewarding.
These are the words of one of Teach For 
Americas 1990 charter corps members.
As a graduating senior, you could at 
this point choose to pursue just about 
any field you wish. We are calling upon 
you to become part of a powerful national 
movement. Recent graduates from 
schools all over the country, represent
ing a diversity of ethnic backgrounds 
and academic majors, are coming to
gether to assume jobs that will enable 
them to play a significant role in edu
cating our nations children.
Over the past 15 months, a team of 
recent graduates has created Teach For 
America, a national corps of outstanding 
individuals who teach in urban and ru
ral areas suffering from persistent 
teacher shortages. Close to 500 corps 
members participated this past summer 
in our training institute and are currently 
teaching in Los Angeles, New York City, 
New Orleans, Baton Rouge, rural Geor
gia and rural North Carolina. They have 
found the experience to be the most chal
lenging they have ever faced.
We have learned a great deal from our 
corps over the course of this past year. 
We have learned how to better prepare 
individuals to enter the classroom and 
how to provide them with more support 
through their experience. And we have 
seen that amazing things happen when 
strong, driven, resourceful individuals 
enter schools and classrooms.
You would not change the world in two 
years with Teach For America. But you 
could be a positive, energetic, creative 
force in the lives of young people. And 
there is no doubt that you would leave 
Teach For America seeing the world in a 
new way. Some of you would resolve to 
commit to your careers in business or 
government or medicine or law, but you 
would enter those fields with a perspec
tive broadened and strengthened by your 
experience.
Our schools demand the attention of 
our nations most talented individuals. A 
great number of extraordinary people 
are graduating in the class of 1991, and 
many of you are about to enter graduate 
school or corporate America. I hope you 
will give Teach For America more than a 
passing thought. No job straight out of 
college can offer you the same opportu
nity to assume such enormous responsi
bility, and to have such a direct impact 
on human lives and on our nations future.
Your career service office and TFAs 
national office (1-800-TFA-1230) can 
provide further information.

University must meet

The present war 
touches the University 
in a number of ways. 
One of the ways con
cerns the presence of
on
vide financial aid so that students who 
leave the ROTC can continue their edu
cation without suffering a financial loss. 
This is the very least the University can

the ROTC program on campus. The Uni
versity affords faculty privileges to offic
ers chosen by the U.S. military and des
ignates as courses their official propa
ganda.
Many of the students joined the ROTC 
having been told that the U.S. military 
was to be used to defend this country. 
Having studied history and observed 
recent events, many of them now realize 
that the U.S. military is used to expand 
U.S. imperialist power and to attack 
countries like Panama and Iraq that do 
not threaten the U.S. Furthermore, many 
of them may now realize that as mem
bers of the armed forces they may be 
ordered by President Bush to kill inno
cent women and children.
Because the University cooperated 
with the Pentagon in bringing students 
into the ROTC, the University has an 
obligation to help those who may now 
wish to leave the ROTC. I am asking that 
the University publicly state that it will 
1) pay legal expenses for students who 
want to resign from ROTC and 2) proEditor:
In the February 18 
issue of The Tartan,
Student Senator 
Stewart Barnes de
scribed the defeat of 
his resolution regarding the Persian Gulf 
war which declared support for service
men stationed there [Senate blows 
chance to support troops in Gulf, 2/18]. 
He listed my name as voting against his 
resolution and demanded that I justify 
my no vote. Simply put, I feel Student 
Senate should take no position at all on 
the war. Senate is not the proper forum 
for foreign policy discussions.
This does not mean that I do not have 
a personal opinion. I do, and I hope that 
every member of the campus community 
has taken the time to think about the 
issues involved in this crisis overseas. I 
am encouraged to see people expressing 
their opinions on both sides. Senates 
role should be to encourage campus or
ganizations to advocate differing sides 
and to support the education of the com
munity. This we have done, by recogniz
ing those organizations that have come 
before us and aiding to publicize events 
on campus.
Barnes expresses disbelief that Stu
dent Senate does not take a position 
which has been taken by several anti
war organizations. Senate is not an anti
war organization. We exist to improve 
the quality of life of the students of Car
negie Mellon. Several resolutions on both 
sides have come before the Senate and 
all of them have been voted down. Senate 
has enough problems to deal with with
out having to begin setting American 
foreign policy.
A vote against Barnes resolution was 
not necessarily a vote against the senti
ments expressed by it. It was a vote to 
not take a position on an issue which is 
beyond the proper scope of Senate. I 
invite Barnes or any other member of the 
student body who wishes to form a cam
pus organization whose purpose is to 
support servicemen to do so. Such an 
organization Senate would support to 
the same degree that we support all 
advocacy groups.

CMU should not regulate 
freedom of speech
on
Letter to 
the Editor
Editor:
The battle cry has 
been heard and an
swered! The lines have 
been drawn! The warriors-have chosen their 
allegiances!! The war in which casual
ties will be the very souls of men and 
women has begun!
No, Im not talking about the Persian 
Gulf war. I am, of course, referring to 
recent fervor that has arisen concerning 
free speech and harassment. Like oth
ers, I have been caught up in the euphoria 
of my own rhetoric and reasoning. 
Therefore, I wish to propose a peace 
plan for the Free Speech War at Car
negie Mellon.
Surprising to those favoring restriction 
of free speech, I assert that Carnegie 
Mellon should not, in cases like that of 
the cmu.marketpost, take action against 
the posters. Why? Because well end up 
like Brown University. As Mr. Levy 
pointed out last week [Free Speech 
Knows No Bounds, 2/18], students will 
soon be suspended or expelled for say
ing the wrong thing.
I do not intend to argue the inherent 
goodness/evil in the post. That is for each 
individual to decide. And that is what 
many fail to see. Suppose I have some
thing which I want to say. For example, 
I wish to say that gays should not be 
allowed to adopt children. The politically 
correct enforcers in the University have 
by now, with their previous actions 
against Mr. Wolfe, scared me from tak
ing my stand. As a result, I dont say 
anything. I keep it amongst myself and 
my closest friends. I cause no controversy. 
I say nothing. In direct consequence, I 
dont start a debate. Nothing happens.
See my logic.
Because of the First Amendment, we 
have the unique  and rather amazing 
possibility for a negative force to act 
as an initiator for positive change. 
Truthfully, I believe gays and lesbians 
should be allowed to adopt children. If 
someone speaks differently (i.e., speaks 
something unkind and offensive), I will 
oppose him or her by arguing against 
his/her idea.
And what does this have to do with my 
comprehensive peace plan? I propose that 
things like Mr. Wolfes post not be cen
sored. I propose no action be taken against 
Mr. Wolfe. What he did did not constitute 
harassment. It was one post meant as a 
joke. It was not hate mail. It was not 
libel. Instead, his humorous post evoked 
a response that educated many people 
about the racism and sexism that do 
exist against Filipinos and women. 
Without his well-intentioned (read: 
humorous) post, none of this would have 
happened.
I also propose that this philosophy be 
followed in the future. If someone (or 
some group) starts harassing a specific 
person or group with repeated posts, 
phone calls, etc., then action can be taken. 
Otherwise, let these incidents bring to 
the surface what many see to be racism 
and sexism. Let these incidents be the 
very evidence of their arguments. Using 
this logicsome will undoubtedly call it 
Orwellian  one can see how those op
posed to racism wish to censor the very 
proof they need!
Mr. Kerr wrote [Harassment under
mines free speech, 2/18] that nobody 
should practice these atrocities any
where, including academic surround
ings. I agree that hate speech can lead 
to violence.
I feel, however, that it is a sad result 
we must bear. In relation to South Africa 
and Iran, I would like to know what kind 
of freedom of speech they have there. 
One thing I cant agree with is the idea 
that annoying words addressed to other 
persons in a public place are not covered 
by the First Amendment. Excluding libel 
and slander, all speech should be pro
tected.
The burning of the U.S. flag, for ex
ample, infuriates me. I sometimes wish 
those types of people would drop off the 
face of the earth. However, even though 
I find their actions annoying (to say the 
least), I believe it is their fundamental 
right to do what they are doing. I will 
protest against the value of flag burning 
but not against the right to do so.
No sane person approves of racism or 
sexism. However, dont try to stop these 
atrocities by degrading the principle that 
allows you to speak out against them. 
Fight those whom you oppose by arguing 
against them with your mind and your 
speech. Taking away their rights only 
reduces you to their level of maturity.

You have a right to say what you want to 
say, and I have a right to say what I want 
to say, under freedom of speech. Either 
you have freedom of speech, or you dont! 
It seems to me that we do, and that we

Seaman offers his 
viewpoint on Gulf issue
onEditor:
I was notified by my 
friend who attends your 
university that there LgttQr tO 
are mixed emotions PHi+nr 
about this war. So many tQIXOl 
people are for or against this war, and 
most people dont know what its about.
This war is not about oil. This war is 
about freedom. Saddam Hussein has 
invaded a country in the Middle East for 
one reason: power. He feels that if he 
controls the oil, he controls the world. 
The oil is a minor factor; the real problem 
is his method of ruling. We already know 
he used gases and chemicals on his own
people. If hell do that to Iraqis, just 
imagine what hell do to Kuwaitis, people 
he doesnt even think are human.
Hussein has used chemicals on Kuwait 
City and many other cities in Kuwait. 
His troops walk down the street, robbing, 1 
raping, and killing innocent people. He 
has fired missiles on Kuwaiti cities, along, 
with Israeli and Saudi Arabian cities.. 
Hussein has also fired Scuds and airattacks on the allied forces, in country 
and afloat; luckily, those were stopped 
before the targets were reached.
Saddam Hussein is not a man to fool 
around with. We must hit him, hit him. 
hard, and stop him. I am on board a ship, 
in the Persian Gulf, and we have gone to., 
battle stations six times in the past threeweeks.
This war is real, folks. People are dy
ing over here, and theyre not all Iraqis 
If you still choose to protest this war, so 
be it. I also wish for peace. I have a wife., 
and family I want to see again. Sitting, , 
out here, waiting two to three weeks for .,, 
mail, praying every night you are able to-u 
read your next letter, praying you will 
make it home safe and alive, is not my 
idea of fun. You want peace, and I tip my 
hat to you, but, in this situation, there, 
really is not any other choice.
To those of you who support us, let us.. 
know. We thank you, your support means  
a lot. Write us a letter.

believe that women are just as capable as 
men at succeeding. I believe there are also ; 
things women are better at than men, and * 
there are things that men are better at 
than women. As a woman, I feel that I can 
achieve whatever I please in life regard
less of the fact that I am a woman. But I do.. 
not think I am better than men, or anyone 
for that matter, nor do I want to be supe
rior over men or completely equal to them. 
There are simply differences between us 
that will never allow us to be completely 
equal or better than one another without 
us having to lose those wonderful qualities that make us male and female.
What I see through the posters and 
other such crap being displayed on walls 
and on the front of the Womens Center is 
not a place for women to go to for support 
and friendship. What I see is a bunch of 
insecure lesbian feminists who want to see 
men become spineless wimps and women 
become a dominant power. When the 
Womens Center advertises movies, dis
cussions, lectures, etc., every one of the 
subjects is about lesbianism, rape, how 
terrible and awful men are, how to defend 
yourself against one, how to be a respect-,.; 
able dyke, etc., etc. If a bowl of Fruit LoopSwere consumed by a man on a Monday 
morning in Tartan Grill, someone from 
the Womens Center could find something 
sexist and chauvinistic about it.
The Womens Center is not a place that 
highlights women and their intelligence 
and achievements. It is a place where 
insecure, angry, sexually confused, 
women sit around and bitch about how 
unlucky they are, how victimized they, 
are, that men are horrible creatures that 
should all be maimed and killed, and oh, 
what a sad sorry bunch of creatures we 
women are (sob sob)... please feel sorry 
for us. This is not a place for hetero
sexual women to talk and spend time.
I wouldnt be seen in the Womens 
Center if it was the last place on campus 
because everything about it conveys ideas 
of lesbianism, female superiority, and 
men-hating. I have no respect for the 
Womens Center and any women associ
ated with it. If the Womens Center wants 
to harness the abilities of young women

Aleohol awareness. Sounds like an 
oxymoron, doesnt it? Well, its still 
10meffching that fraternities all around 
trying to start up.
Abftlit 10 years ago, the Animal House 
;ter#ftype of fraternities may still have 
been true. Traditionally, during the 60s 
and '70s, fraternities were just big party 
houses.
But' dont forget what was going on 
during the 60s and 70s.
That 20-year period was a time in 
which everyone was doing everything. 
The s'exual revolution and the drug revo
lution were the big things going on.
Fraternities werent much different 
from what everyday people were like. 
They^were just more visible than indi
viduals.
Befbre the 60s and 70s, fraternities 
were'just as conservative as the nation 
was. Yes, they partied. But they also did 
manyother social things. Community 
service was always big, and scholastics

were important.
Today, fraternities have changed again. 
They are out of the Animal House era 
of being a bunch of big partiers and 
pulling frat pranks. We still party  
thats still true  but it isnt as it was. 
Fraternities are concerned again about 
what is going on.
Just look at what they do on this 
campus alone. Greek Sing raises thou
sands of dollars for charity. DTD runs 
the Postman party for Students Against 
Multiple Sclerosis. And there are many 
other things fraternities do, such as sup
porting visual-handicap awareness, 
Childrens Hospital fund raisers, help
ing at local hospitals, Big Brother and 
Sister programs  the list goes on.
Thatss why I cant understand all these 
problems with the BYOB idea and alco
hol in general. Last year, this came to a 
head on CMUs campus when ATO tried 
to force the houses on campus to adopt 
their risk management policy, FIPG. 
FIPG policy states that there can be no 
air taps on in the house. A number of 
houses on campus have this policy, as 
dictated by their national charter.
And then, there are other nationals 
with other policies. Last year, it was 
decided that the Inter-fraternity Coun

ideas for controlling alcohol....
cil could not tell the houses which policy 
to adopt, as it was the job of their nation
als to do so. But they did get some good 
ideas for controlling alcohol and the 
problems associated with it.
First, someone proposed a sober pa
trol. This would be a group of brothers 
from all the houses that would go houseto-house and make sure everything was 
going all right. They would not be al
lowed to drink, and if they found a situ
ation that needed to be dealt with, they 
would tell the house president so it could 
be taken care of. They would also help 
out, if need be.
Second, there was an idea of beginning 
an escort service to take care of driving 
people home who were drunk or attend 
another school. This would keep people 
aware of others who had too much to
drink and would enable either the sober 
patrol or a separate escort group to get 
them home okay.
The BYOB policy is not a good one. But 
because CMUs IFC representatives were 
shown up by Pitt, they had to do some
thing. They decided to try a BYOB 
weekend and see how it went. However, 
think about it. People would be carrying 
bottles or cans around. If someone got in 
a fight, which usually happens a few 
times a weekend, these bottles and cans 
would be flying.
Second, the house floors would be cov
ered in glass, which is rather dangerous. 
Finally, as said before, there would be no 
control over what people drank.
Also, people naturally will be carrying 
around their bottles from house to house, 
not wanting to just dump half a beer that
they bought. This will bring back the 
problem the campus had up until the 
summer of 1988. People drank and partied outside  and the Liquor Control 
Board busted two PAT buses worth of 
students. The houses right now have the 
ability to control who gets served and 
when to stop serving. Granted, this isnt 
enforced as well as it should be, but at 1 
least its there.
My whole point is that there is too 
much concentration on what the frater1 
nities do in the way of partying. It is not 
such a big problem.
The BYOB policy is bad, period. If IFC 
would look into doing the sober patrol 
and escort service, and if the houses 
would take more control over how much 
people drink, there would not be a 
problem.
The alcohol problem would be solved, 
or at least on its way to being solved. 
There is nothing wrong with drinking. 
Its just being able to handle the respon
sibility, which most mature adults should 
be able to do. Leave the fraternities alone 
on this issue and try to see the positive 
things they do.

If crying uncle is slang for surrendering, then 
Iraqs-'announcement Friday that it might pull out 
of Kuwait amounted to something like saying first 
cousin once removed  not quite uncle but a 
ing sound nonetheless. The right words, 
though, have not been uttered.
Words alone, especially in the Middle East, 
amount to little. Its instructive to bear in mind that 
Saddam Hussein once before promised to withdraw 
from 'Kuwait. That was in August, shortly after he 
d the country. Baghdad even released film 
purportingto show its troops heading home. Satellite 
photos and other intelligence showed the opposite. 
Iraq was digging in  and an indignant George 
Busli went ballistic, calling Iraq a liar. In essence, 
the war began that very day.
Similarly, while any Iraqi mention of a withdrawal 
from Kuwait is unprecedented, its apparent attempt 
to linklt to the Palestinian issue is not exactly new. 
In th Weeks preceding the January 16 onset of the 
air war, it maintained that Kuwait could not be 
treated in a vacuum: Israels occupation of the West 
Ban&and Gaza Strip had to be on the table, too.
There were two problems with that condition: It
was patently insincere and, if accepted, would have 
rewarded Iraq for its aggression. The United States, 
leaning on its allies, rejected it.
Now the Palestinian issue has once again been 
linked to withdrawal from Kuwait. But even if 
Israel were predisposed to surrender the Occupied 
Territories  and the government of Prime Minister 
Yitzhak Shamir most certainly is not  the prob
lem would remain incredibly complicated. The 
question of Jerusalem alone  sacred to both Jews 
and Arabs, not to mention Christians  may well 
be beyond resolution. Even within the Israeli peace 
movement, there is little support for giving up 
Jerusalem.
The linkage of the impractical  Israeli with
drawal from the Occupied Territories  with the 
practical and justIraqs withdrawal from Kuwait 
is an hoary negotiating tactic. The United States 
and its allies are right to reject it. An acceptance 
would probably mean a truce and, in time, the 
inclination to accept the status quo.
Moreover, it would make Saddam Hussein the 
hero of the Arab world and put our allies, Saudi 
Arabia and Egypt, in an untenable position  on 
the wrong side ofthe Palestinian question. Saddam 
Hussein is undeserving of such an honor.
War is the most horrible of mans endeavors and 
no one in his right mind can favor it. But for
Saddam Hussein, it is just another activity. He 
initiated a war with Iran, periodically called for 
peace, and eventually wound up accepting a draw. 
Just how much he was deterred is evident in what 
he did next: the attempted genocide of the Kurds 
(through the use of poison gas) and the invasion of 
Kuwait. This man had what police call a previous. 
He cannot be trusted.
But he has stumbled, badly miscalculating the 
way a war would go. Iraq has been battered, and 
desertions from its army are increasing. Publicly, 
Saddam Hussein has extended the prospect of peace 
to his war-weary people, especially the troops who 
have taken such a pounding. Now, publicly, he has 
ventured the opinion that Kuwait is not all that 
dear  that it is not, as he has maintained, an 
integral and historic part of Iraq, the vaunted 19th 
province  that he has asked his people to fight on 
for a trivial purpose.
That lesson cannot be lost on those who do the 
fighting and the dying. The very suggestion of a 
withdrawal from Kuwait triggered celebrations in 
Baghdad. Kuwait, once rich and uppity, is loathed 
in Iraq, but not hated or feared as an enemy. 
Saddam Hussein is improvising, taking advantage 
of a rising pro-Iraq sentiment in the Soviet mili
tary, the pressure brought on by Mikhail Gorbachev, 
the debate in the United Nations and the revulsion
over deaths of civilians. He is playing many cards, 
but holds the hand of the loser.
The bombing of a civilian air-raid shelter and 
those grisly pictures of the dead and wounded 
brought home to America and the world that this 
war, like any war, is a horrific enterprise. To recoil, 
to yell enough, would be only natural.
But to leave Saddam Hussein enhanced in pres
tige, a military loser but a diplomatic winner, 
would simply set the stage for the next war  one 
that might be far costlier than this one. After all, if 
30 percent of his military has been destroyed, 70 
percent still remains  that and a megalomaniacs 
enduring bitterness.
Clearly, the United States and its allies are 
winning the war  and winning it in a rout. 
History, not to mention common sense, says that 
they should be the ones who set the conditions for 
peace. Time and time again, through United Nations 
resolutions and other means, they have done so: 
unambiguous and unconditional withdrawal from 
Kuwait.
That would be the cry of uncle the world is 
waiting to hear. Anything less is a victory for 
Saddam Hussein.

Edward Gibbon, historian and 
wit, was diyly funny even in his 
footnqtps, such as this one on gi;s;.
. Ihe tallest, the most gentle, 
and tle most useless of the large 
quadrupeds. This singular animal, 
a native of only the interior parts of 
Africa* has not been seen in Eu
rope since the revival of letters. 
Was it mere coincidence or did 
the quickening of Europes intellectul life actually cause the de
parture of the giraffes? Did they 
ive an aversion to learning? 
Gibbon was having fun with the
historians chore of discerning the 
causation behind events. Today 
some historians want to don white 
smocks and enlist science in their 
search for such explanations.
A government museum, which 
possesses some of Lincolns hair, 
blood and skull fragments, may 
allow scientists to try to clone 
Lincolns tissue for analysis of his 
DNA, which is the determinant of 
heredity. What will this enable 
historians to explain? Not much.
Scientists might determine 
whether Lincoln suffered from 
Marfan syndrome. Many victims 
of that disorder are tall and gangly 
and susceptible to sudden heart 
failure. Lincoln was 56 when as
sassinated, older than most 19th
century Marfan victims lived to be. 
But so what? Establishing that he 
had it would shed no light on his
tory because it would not justify 
inferences about the causes of 
historic actions.
Perhaps someday science will be 
able to identify a genetic cause of 
chronic depression and will estab
lish that Lincoln was afflicted. But 
note the adjective chronic.
Anyway, for cloning to reveal 
something of historic importance, 
the something would have to per
tain to a mental impairment of 
personality. Some people believe 
genes define the essence of the 
person. Here we reach the heart of 
the matter: What is essential?
I believe persons are what they
read. That formulation is short
hand for: The essence of a person is 
what he or she thinks, because 
history is the history of minds, 
which are undetermined.
Certain physical facts about in
dividuals can cause large historic 
effects. Perhaps (it would be nice to 
think so) Napoleons hemorrhoids 
really did have some determining 
effect on his conduct at Waterloo. 
And there is evidence that amedical 
fact may have been the cause of a 
century-shaping effect.
Obviously such science can in
form history. What is worrisome is 
that some historians will try to 
find in science still more reasons 
for writing history with the poli
tics left out. Such history does not
treat man as a political animal, a 
social creature acting autono
mously, moved by his own reasons 
and convictions.
Many academic historians 
nowadays explain the causes of 
great effects by radically discount
ing the role of mind, of ideas, of 
individual greatness. The human 
story is told too much in terms of 
social structures, and classes 
whose consciousness are imposed 
by impersonal economic forces.
Today it is considered demo
cratic to write history from the 
bottom up rather than the top 
down, discounting the importance 
of the distinguished few. The very 
idea of individual greatness is con
sidered problematic, perhaps ab
surd and certainly politically in
correct. The consciousness of indi
viduals, or classes, or nations, or 
even entire ages is routinely writ
ten about as the reflection of more 
real causes.
The art of biography already is 
suffering the ravages of 
psychobiographers who reduce 
their subjects convictions to neu
roses and ascribe to their subjects 
motives severed from ideas. May 
we at least be spared explanations 
of Lincolns genius, or the essence 
of any individual, in terms of ge
netics.

Inconsistent testimony 
irks grad student
EsEditor:
In your article last 
week on war research 
at CMU [CMU en
gages in war research,
2/18], I found two 
statements that seemed inconsistent: A 
students claim that he wasnt told he 
would be working on military projects
Letter to 
the Editor
followed by his claim: ...I was given a 
stack of classified military manuals to 
read up on. The inconsistency stems 
from my knowledge of the procedures 
established by the military for handling 
classified information.
Before returning to CMU for graduate 
study I worked in the defense industry 
for six years. I had a security clearance 
and was regularly instructed on the 
proper ways to handle classified mate
rial. The point most frequently stressed 
was that no one may view, read, or even 
be alone in a room with classified data 
unless they have a security clearance. 
Compliance with these procedures is 
monitored by the government and viola
tions are subject to severe penalties.
The students description of events in 
the article leads me to believe the actual 
situation was one of the following: 1) He 
has security clearance and was given clas
sified information as part of his job duties. 
2) He does not have a valid security 
clearance yet was given access to dassifiedinformation. Or 3) He was given infor
mation that was, in fact, not classified.
If it was the first case, he cannot claim 
he did not know what he was doing  
security clearances simply are not, can
not, be given without the recipients con
sent. If a person consented to get a clear
ance, certainly he must have at the very 
least suspected he would be working with 
classified information. Why else would 
he have a clearance?
If the manuals were classified and he 
does not have a clearance, then a crime 
has been committed. It is a felony (under 
the espionage statutes) to distribute 
classified data to uncleared personnel. 
The student should have first reported 
this incident not to The Tartan but to the 
Robotics Institute Classification/Security 
officer, or the FBI.
Now lets just say it was actually the 
third scenario  the manuals were not 
classified. One can only assume the stu
dent was engaging in ignorant hyper
bole, if not outright deceit. I agree with
his contention that one should not be 
required to work on any projectclassi
fied or not  that he or she does not 
want. My experience with graduate re
search has not been one of dictated la
bors. I have always felt free to change my 
research project, but at the possible cost 
of abandoning my existing work and 
starting over. This may seem too high a 
price to pay, but decisions of conviction 
are not free.
My best guess is that the last case is the 
closest to what actually happened. Obvi
ously the student did not want to work on 
his assigned project, as is his right. How
ever I do not thinkhe should have resorted 
to exaggeration to make his point. The 
resulting incongruities cast doubt on the 
veracity of the entire article.

Most rapes are committed by some
one the victim knows. Rapists are 
generally ordinary, everyday men.
$1,250 buys what?
HeAI5mrG
Ingrid Bromberg and 
Justine Dymond
The long-needed attention that 
has finally (but still minimally) 
been given to rape on campus has 
provoked many reactions that are 
common and natural, the most 
common being anger. We recently 
read a letter to the editor in The 
Tartan in which a male student 
expressed very strong anger to
wards the rapists of two of his 
friends [Rapists will receive 
punishment, 2/4]. It is encour
aging, for we who work to stop 
rape on this campus, to see victims 
and friends of victims speak out 
after so many years of silence. 
The only disturbing thing about 
this particular letter was that the 
writer labeled the rapist as sick.
Tliis is a common misconception 
about rapists. The rapist needs to 
be demystified. As a result of the 
type of rape that the news media 
covers, many people hold the belief 
that rapists are insane, psychotic, 
or sick. If it is true that rapists 
ACa SCaAFL of society, and we know 
that woman is raped every six 
minutes, then a large population of 
men is insane. Nothing could be 
further from the truth.
This belief that the rapist is a 
psychopath contributes to the
perpetuation of rape. The victim 
who has been raped by an ac
quaintance, a friend, a relative, or 
an upstanding member of the com
munity, meets with disbelief when 
he or she tells his or her story. 
Why? Because according to the 
myth of the psychopathic rapist, 
such nice men wouldnt rape.
Yet only a very small percent
age of rapes are committed by 
those so-called psychotics. Un
fortunately, the only rapes that 
the news media covers are the 
sensational ones. Think back to 
this past summer and the rapes of 
young women in Oakland. These 
rapes made good scoops; however, 
rapes happen all the time and go 
unnoticed. Stop Rape, a statisticsgathering group at CMU, already 
knows of ten times the number of 
rapes that occurred in Oakland 
this past summer that have oc
curred since then.
Most rapes are committed by 
someone the victim knows. Rap
ists are generally ordinary, every
day men. They are friends, rela
tives, people we meet at parties, 
students, professors, etc. In short, 
there is no rapist stereotype.
In fact, as Diana E.H. Russell 
writes in The Politics of Rape: The 
Victims Perspective, ... rape is 
not so much a deviant act as an 
overconforming act.
Rape is a crime of violence and 
an abuse of power. It is not a 
result of the rapists inability to 
control a sexual urge. It is a result 
of the value society places on cer
tain masculine behavior and 
qualities. Rape may be under
stood as an extreme acting out of 
qualities that are regarded as
supermasculine in this and many 
other societies: aggression, force, 
power, strength, toughness, 
dominance, competitiveness, 
writes Russell.
It is extreme, not in the sense of 
freakishness, but in the sense that 
these qualities are generally re
garded in less violent circum
stances as good: the marketplace, 
education, daily life on the street. 
It becomes extreme when the per
son who exhibits these socially 
praised qualities uses them to 
physically overpower someone.
For most rapists, it is not a 
sexual urge that causes them to 
rape  it is a want to overpower 
someone else. This is easy to do to 
someone who has less power than 
you, which is why victims of rape 
usually belong to socially and po
litically disenfranchised groups: 
women, children, and gay men. 
This issue is difficult because it 
calls into question socially and 
institutionally sanctioned domi
nance of certain people over oth
ers in our society.
It wasnt until recently that 
Pennsylvania law recognized the 
crime of spousal rape. Previously, 
a man could rape his wife, but she 
couldnt file charges. Basically, 
the idea was that a husband had 
a right to force sex on a woman 
just because she was his wife. In 
the eyes of the law, the husband 
had the right to control his wifes
body. This way of thinking is also 
what often prevails in acquain
tance rape. A man thinks he de
serves sex because he paid for the 
date. Being married, taking a 
woman out, somehow gives the 
man power to gain control of a 
womans body.
The idea that a man has a right 
to force sex on a date, on his wife, 
on anyone, stems from the social
ization of male children. Little boys 
generally grow up seeing that they 
have a right to certain things that 
women dont. They see that women 
seem made to satisfy their needs 
and pleasures. They also grow up 
learning that if they dont get what 
they want, or if someone bothers 
them, they should use their physi
cal strength to make the situation 
go their way. This is how a rapist is 
made mentally.
It is important to remember that 
unless the person has consented 
to having sex, it is rape; a con
senting person cannot be some
one passed out, someone intimi
dated, or someone pressured into 
having sex. Recognizing how 
people are conditioned toward 
overpowering weaker people is 
the way to prevent one of your 
friends or even yourself from 
raping.

Dining Service might be able to 
hire a decent caterer with the ex

wed get a hamburger that tastes 
like something other than card

the money as a subsidy so theyll be 
able to lower their prices into the 
land of the reasonable.
On a related note, for my $1,250,
Id better see some peanut butter 
come back to Salads Plus pretty 
damn soon. Dining Service might 
think its no big deal, but I know at 
least one person whos fanatical 
enough about his peanut butter to 
bring ajar of Skippy extra-ci^nchy

hes not alone in his wishes,,,
Of course, theres always one

A PERSON'S
OPNON
Recently, Pitts chapter of SAE 
fraternity instituted a BYOB 
policy and will no longer be 
serving alcohol to party guests.
What would you think of a 
similar policy being insti
tuted at CMU?
I dont think its a good idea. 
For one thing, people would 
bring all sorts of hard alcohol to 
parties. I guess I like the fact 
that girls dont have to pay.
I disagree with the BYOB 
policy. The fraternities provide 
a great social opportunity for

SjftJWomen win LIAA outright
By JASON McDONALD junior guard Bridget Eperthener. They
PRESS PASS
by Jason McDonald
just imagine if 
9 were wearing 
skates....
Ive only had a few intensely 
humbling experiences in my 
lifetime: Thursday nights 
intramural hockey game was 
definitely one of them. Since our 
starting goalie had a test and 
couldnt make the game, I 
bravely made my career debut 
between the pipes with only 30 
minutes of advance notice.
Suffice it to say, Ill under
stand if my friends and team
mates want to pretend they 
dont know me. The number 19 
used to be special to me  I 
wore it in Little League  but 
now its a ugly reminder of my 
dismal goal-tending perfor
mance. As I told my team after 
the game, wed have been fine if 
I didnt suck.
One. Seven seconds in, the 
other team was on the board, 
and the NHL scouts were on 
their way home. If I hadnt been 
in the net, I would have appreci
ated the great passing display 
the other team put on. Three 
passes got them from the comer 
across the crease to the far side 
of the defense, and one shot got 
them on the board.
Two. We got ripped off on a 
high stick call, and the opposi
tion had a power play. Instead 
r of working the puck around, the 
point man decided to just shoot 
it. Good decision  I think I 
was close enough to feel the 
' breeze, but I dont remember.
1 Seven. The first goal of the 
second period was your stan
dard low comer wrist shot. The 
setup was the unusual part.
' They sent a high shot at me  
easy glove save, right? Wrong. I 
took it right off the face, or 
where my face would have been 
if I didnt have a helmet.
Eleven and Twelve. These 
were the redundancy goals. I 
" cbuld see rebounds just fine 
when they kicked out to the 
sides, but I had mega-problems 
when they fell right in front, of 
me. Both times, the puck fell at 
my feet and the other team 
poked it in for the easy score.
My teammates piece of advice: 
Just close your eyes and start 
kicking. Funny, thats what I 
had been doing for the first two 
periods.
Sixteen. I know its only a 
drop in the bucket, but this one 
was not a goal. The puck hit the 
post behind me and bounced out 
front. It had to have hit the 
post, but the official, who didnt 
even see the play but took the 
safe bet considering my prior 
performance, called it a goal.
Seventeen. This goal was the 
one where I got too caught up in 
playing traffic cop. I was so 
busy yelling at my defense to 
cover the man on my right that 
I forgot to watch the man on the 
left, who blew the puck right by 
me.
The ironic thing about the 
whole evening is that I probably 
ended up with a better save 
percentage than my counterpart 
  only by virtue of the fact that 
I faced around 50 shots on the 
evening while he might have 
seen 10.
Oh well. Ive got to stop for 
now  its time to start prepar
ing for my next game. I figure 
ill go bother Gilles Meloche at 
his jewelery store to play for us. 
After all, we need someone in 
goal; he might as well have 
some experience.

IM major, not a goalie.

Although it was anything but easy, the 
Carnegie Mellon womens basketball 
team gained outright possession of the 
University Athletic Association title with 
a 69-62 victory over the University of 
Rochester.
Wednesdays win over the 
Yellowjacketsthe loss was Rochesters 
eighth straightimproved the Tartans 
final record to 21-5, including a 12-2 
mark in the UAA.
We were definitely motivated coming 
into the game, said junior guard Heather 
ODonnell. We didnt want to share the 
UAA championship with anyone.
We knew theyre a very quick team, 
and we knew theyd come at us, said
They
really hustled when we played them in 
Rochester, so we knew wed have to play 
like a division champion or theyd run 
away with the game.
We also knew that Coach [Gerri Seidl] 
really wanted the win; she didnt want to 
share the title with anyone.
Although the CMU seemed to be in 
control of the game the entire way, it 
could never quite manage to put Roches
ter away. The Tartans, who never trailed 
after the first two minutes of action, 
watched their lead reach double digits 
four times in the game, but the 
Yellowjackets were within one point with 
3:10 left in the game.
The Tartans got off to a fast start,

Yellowjackets sting Tartans, 82-69
By JASON McDONALD
Tartan Assistant Sports Editor
The Carnegie Mellon mens 
basketball team ended its season 
with a 82-69 loss to the Univer
sity of Rochester on Wednesday 
night.
The Tartans held a three point 
lead with 12:44 remaining, but 
the defending Division III na
tional champions put together a 
six-minute 152 run to pull out 
the victory.
The loss dropped the Tartans to 
a final season mark of 9-15, in
cluding a 3-11 record in the 
University Athletic Association.
Their big men play really well 
and they play well together, said 
freshman forward Matt Reiprish. 
Defensively, theyre also a step 
above everyone else weve played 
this year.
The Yellowjackets pulled out 
the game with excellent shooting 
and rebounding. The Tartans lost 
the battle of the boards by 16  
that is, when there were any re
bounds to get. The Yellowjackets 
shot .585 from the floor during
the evening.
The Tartans were also hindered 
by the absence of sophomore 
Lamman Rucker from the lineup. 
Ruckers absence  for personal 
reasons as opposed to an injury 
showed up not only in the re
bound totals, but also in the 
blocked shot totals. In all, the 
Yellowjackets rejected 11 Tartan 
shots.
We really missed Lamman, 
said freshman center Derek 
Dragisich. He would have given 
us more strength and depth in

half. The next minute belonged to 
Rochesters Martin Ryan; the

baskets to force a Carnegie Mel

Carnegie Mellon track relays compete at SRU
By MARTHA NORRIS
Special to the Tartan 
& ALIM RAY 
Tartan Sports Editor
The Carnegie Mellon mens and 
womens track teams prepared 
for next weekends University 
Athletic Association Champion
ships with a relay meet at Slip
pery Rock University Friday 
night.
The womens team distance 
medley relay, consisting of junior 
Lois Raska, senior Lisa Schmidt, 
senior Kristin Burgard, and se
nior Sue Sparks, placed third 
overall. Junior longjumper Susan 
Wempa also competed for the first
time after being out for two years 
due to injury. Everyone was 
pretty happy with their races, 
said Raska.
Although team scores were not 
being kept and the results of the 
meet will not be known until later 
this week, mens Head Coach Gary 
Meckley felt the team did very 
well at Slippery Rock, despite the 
injuries it has had this semester. 
The team looked pretty good, 
looked as good as we possibly can, 
under the circumstances... were 
looking better each meet, said 
Meckley.
Meckley is very pleased with 
the way Carnegie Mellon, a Divi
sion III school, has competed
against other teams. Of the Divi
sion III teams, we were far and 
away the best of them, said 
Meckley.
Carnegie Mellon placed fourth 
out of approximately 12 teams 
from Divisions I, II, and III com
peting at Slippery Rock, accord
ing to Meckley. Slippery Rock and 
Carnegie Mellon were very close 
in the running events but the 
Tartans did not have the depth in 
the field events that Slippery Rock 
had, he said.
Outstanding performances on 
the mens side included senior 
Jeff Illian and freshman Jarrod 
Siket in the one mile relay. 
Sophomore Brad Shapiro also did

Coach Dario Donatelli said, Were 
looking forward to doing the best 
we can against other teams.
I think well do really well,
said Raska. Weve been working 
pretty hard.
Fridays meet served as a warm
up before the championships, in 
which Division III teams from 
around the country will compete. 
It was a good tune-up* for next 
week. It gave us an extra race to 
gain experience, said sophomore 
Brad Shapiro.

utes, but then cooled off just as 
quickly. With 8:42 left in the half, 
Rochester was back to within one 
point of the Tartans, 22-21.
A few minutes later, the Tar
tans went on a late 12-2 run. In a 
span of four minutes, their lead 
reached a game-high 11 points. 
After Rochesters Meredith 
Roesing broke the Tartan run, 
the final minute of the half went 
quietly, and the Tartans took a 
38-29 lead to the locker room.
After three even minutes of play, 
the two teams exchanged big 
scoring runs. The Yellowjackets 
struck first with eight straight 
points, chopping the lead to three, 
4441. The Tartans came right 
back with a 10-3 run to give them 
their last double-digit lead with 
9:18 on the clock.
The teams traded more knock
out blows over the next four min
utes. The ten-point cushion only 
lasted a little more than a minute; 
the Jackets were back within one 
with 7:50 to play. The Tartans 
answered with a six point run of 
their own, followed by a 71 
Yellowjacket run. With 3:10 re
maining, the score was Carnegie 
Mellon 63, Rochester 62.
The Tartans escaped in the 
closing minutes by capitalizing 
on the foul line. The Tartans made 
their final six points from the

line; in fact, a basket by ODonnell 
with 6:18 left was the Tartans 
last score from the floor.
Its been the same way the last 
seven or eight games, said 
Eperthener. We come out OK in 
the first couple of minutes after 
the half, and we blow our lead. We 
never feel like were going to lose 
the game; our intensity just drops 
a little.
There were some points in the 
game where we just slowed down, 
said ODonnell, but they were 
also playing hard because they 
were out to get us. It was their 
last game and they wanted to 
beat the top team in the UAA. 
The Tartans had five players 
reach double-digit scoring. 
ODonnell led the team with 16, 
Eperthener had 13, and fresh
man forward Jeanine Megahan 
addedll, althoughlO ofher points 
came in the first half. Junior for
ward Amy Buxbaum and freshman forward Mary Moore wef 
the other Tartans in double digits 
with 10 points apiece.
Megahan led the Tartans wiifi 
nine rebounds; ODonnell and 
Moore each added seven.
The Tartans, ranked sixteenth 
in the nation entering the game 
against Rochester, earned their 
ticket to the Division III playoffs 
by winning the UAA conference 
bid last weekend in Boston. Pair
ings for the regional playoffs (the 
Tartans will be competing in the
Mid-Atlantic Region) will be an-...
nounced sometime this week.
At the beginning of the season,.. : 
we were basically thinkine about T 
a .500 season, said Eperthener. , ; 
We took a nothing-to-lose atti
tude, and that really pushed us a 
lot.

pointers to a game-tying 11-^4 
run. At the intermission, the 
score stood knotted at 33.
When the second half started, 
it looked as if the game was 
going to go right down to the 
wire, but Rochesters offense was 
pretty much a one-man show. 
Junior forward Michael 
Coleman scored 11 of his 15 
points in the second half, in
cluding a pair of buckets that 
kicked off the Yellowjackets 
game-winning rally.
Their inside game just wore 
us down, said freshman center 
Derek Dragisich. It wasnt a 
letdown on our part; they juBt 
kept taking it to us inside.
Reiprish hit a three-pointer to 
stop the run, but Rochester came 
back with six more points to 
lead 64-51 with 4:39 left. 
Freshman forward Michael 
Hosni, who led the Tartans with
19 points, hit a pair of threepointers to pull the Tartans back  
to single digits, 69-60.
The last two minutes werent a 
fair indication of the close game 
that came before, as the Tartans 
had to foul to get the ball back. 
The Tartans fouled 10 times in 
the final two minutes, which re
sulted in 12 Rochester points off 
free throws. The Tartans matched 
the Yellowjackets down the 
stretch, but still ended up trailing 
by 13 points, 82-69.
In addition to Hosnis 19 points, 
the Tartans got 14 from junior 
guard Phil Bronner, 13 from se
nior guard Lewis Jackson, and 11 
from Reiprish. Jackson, playingin 
his final game as a Tartan, also 
had three assists and two steals 
in 30 minutes of action.
I wish I had him for another 
couple of seasons, said Head 
Coach Tony Wingen. From the 
beginning of the season to the end
of the season, hes improved as 
much as anyone.
The biggest thing were los
ing is his leadership, he con
tinued. He also gave us a spark 
on defense and had some very 
big offensive games as well.
Although the Tartans fin
ished the season with a 9-15 
record, the players are pleased 
with their teams performance.
I suppose its a little disap
pointing because we lost a 
couple of close games, said 
Reiprish, but we improved 
throughout the season. Im 
pretty happy with the way we 
did this year.
Based on how the team did 
last year, we have a lot to be 
proud of and a lot to look for
ward to, said Dragisich. Ifthe 
second half of this season was 
any indication, were going to 
pay a lot of teams back next 
year.

Michigan-based corporation, has 
reportedly expressed an interest

New York Islanders fans were 
shocked when their star center 
Pat LaFontaine requested a trade.
LaFontaine has been the sole 
driving force behind what little 
success the Isles have had during 
the past two seasons. If it hadnt 
been for him, the Isles would have 
been even worse. If the Islanders 
do trade him, it is likely that it

CMU ice hockey drops two straight

By DAVE MARTIN
Tartan Staffwriter
The CMU hockey club took the 
ice against Slippery Rock Uni
versity last night in hopes of 
.keeping its playoff chances alive.
. Those chances were dimmed by 
the absence of graduate students 
Mark Li and Erik Galis and se
nior Jeremy Savian, and dashed 
by the rough Slippery Rock team. 
After two relatively calm but highscoring periods, the third ex
ploded in a point-fest for Slippery 
Rock, nearly ending in a brawl.
; CMU scored first on a power 
play only 2:44 into the game, as 
junior captain Ed Kilduff got the 
assist from graduate student 
Chris Keim and senior captain 
Denny Frey. At 10:46, SRU tied 
the game on a power play of its 
own, then took the lead 50 sec
onds later as Mike Heilman scored 
his second goal for SRU.
With neither team proving a 
dominant force, the game pro
gressed calmly. With a minute 
left in the period, Kilduff, again 
on a power play, scored his second 
goal to tie the game at 22.
But SRUs Heilman, wasnt 
done. With 18 seconds remaining 
in the period, he fired a shot and 
scored, giving SRU a 3-2 lead 
going into the second period. CMU 
managed only five shots during 
the period, showing a slight edge 
defensively for SRU, which had
12 shots on goal.
Carnegie Mellon dominated the 
first five minutes of the second 
.period, ending in another power 
play score by senior Craig Palli, 
who took the assist from Keim 
and Kilduff. Only 13 seconds later, 
however, Heilman scored his 
fourth goal for short-handed SRU, 
giving SRU a 4-3 lead. Slippery 
Rock began dominating the game, 
and scored again at 3:54 in the 
period, lifting SRU to a 5-3 lead 
going into the intermission. Jun
ior goalkeeper Dave Sealfon had 
23 saves in the second period 
alone, while CMU had only 12 
;shots on goal.
; The furious third period began 
slowly, but what SRU began in 
the second period continued as it 
;scored on a power play with 12:39 
;in the game. Exactly four minutes 
later, Heilman scored his fifth 
'and final goal for SRU, giving 
SRU a 7-3 lead. Heilman got in 
an assist with 7:10 left in the 
game, and SRU led 8-3. Slippery 
:Rock scored its last goal at 6:49, 
.'taking a 9-3 lead. Almosta minute 
Hater, Kilduff cleared a hat trick 
for CMU. Palli and freshman 
iChris Chicoskie got the assist,
making the score 9-4.
With 5:30 left, the game turned 
into a whistle party for the refer
ees. After a series of minor penal
ties, the referees called Palli for 
throwing his stick, and awarded 
SRU the penalty shot attempt. 
From center ice, the SRU player 
skated in against Sealfon, who 
blocked the shot. Sixteen seconds 
later, Sealfon came out, and was 
replaced by Dan Sim, who had 
five saves as goalie.
At 2:49, Kilduff came under fire 
from the referees, who handed 
him a two-minute minor for 
charging, compounding it with 
another for unsportsmanlike 
conduct. He was then charged 
with gross misconduct and re
turned to the locker room for the 
remainder of the game.
Another series of penalties en
sued as tensions increased expo
nentially. Frey was caught for 
slashing, which caused a fight 
between him and SRUs Pete 
Gadd. Frey served a two and Gadd 
was escorted from the ice, but was 
never .called for a penalty. With 
57 seconds to play, yet another 
dispute broke out, which sent an 
SRU player to the penalty box. 
Four seconds later, a fight erupted 
and SRUs Dan Grentz was ejected 
from this game as well as dis
qualified from the next game.
At this point, the referees de
cided not to allow the game to go 
on further, as a winner was al
ready determined, and the pen
alties only served to slow the 
game.
Saturday evening the hockey 
club traveled to Morgantown, W. 
Va., to take on the league leading 
West Virginia University Moun
taineers. The CMU hockey club 
was without Frey and Mueller, 
but the game started hopefully 
for CMU. As the game progressed, 
however, CMU wore down against 
the Mountaineers, who scored 
four goals in the third period. 
CMU found itself on the losing 
end of the contest after a threegame winning streak.
The first period was a particu
larly uneventful one, though 
Sealfon had 12 saves against a 
pushy WVU offense. CMU had 
only six shots on goal throughout 
the period, and came away empty 
on all of them. No team proved 
more dominant, and after 15 min
utes of play, both teams were 
scoreless.
Early in the second period, 
Kilduff came out of the game for a 
few shifts after being drilled by a 
puck coming off Galis stick, but 
returned to little avail. After a
questionable penalty, West Vir
ginia scored on the power play 
with 7:11 to play in the second, 
slowly taking the dominant role 
in the game. With 2:34 left before 
the intermission, WVU scored 
again to take a 2-0 lead. In the 
final 1:30, CMU fired numerous 
shots on goal, but was unable to 
convert any, thus going to the 
locker room scoreless and down.

Today, members of Spirit concentrate on their studies while waiting for what many say is slow response to concerns raised in 1988.
Black enrollment shot up in late 60s
By HOWDY PIERCE
Tartan Contributing Editor
Although they did not arrive 
inlarge numbers until the mid1960s, black students have 
been attending Carnegie 
Mellon for quite a while, say 
long-time members of the 
campus community.
Weve had graduates who 
go back into the 40s, says 
Senior Vice President Ed 
Schatz, who received his un
dergraduate degree from 
Carnegie Tech in 1944 and 
remained at the Univer
sity since.
In my lifetime at the University, no blacks have been 
denied admission because of 
their [race], he says. There 
ivere not very many blacks,
d5
but theyve been here.
Because the University 
never had a policy of denying 
admission based on race, it is 
difficult to identify the first 
black student to attend.
Schatz says he can recall a 
black engineering student of 
his who attended sometime 
between the years 1946 and 
1950. Physics professor Hugh 
Young, who came to Carnegie 
Tech as a freshman in 1948, 
says he remembers a sprin
kling of black men in his en
tering class.
However, it was not until 
the 1960s that black students 
first became prominent at 
Carnegie Mellon. Neal 
Huguley Jr., who graduated 
from CFA in 1965, was pic
tured in The Thistle as a
member of the Tau Delta Phi 
fraternity starting in 1963.
Although blacks appear pe
riodically throughout the de
cade, a study of past issues of 
The Thistle shows no empha
sis on black students until the 
1968 edition, in which a man 
identified only as a student is 
seen speaking at a protest over 
racism. The same edition of 
The Thistle shows several 
students, both black and 
white, at a civil rights protest 
in Washington, D.C.
ErrollR. Davis Jr., currently 
the president and CEO of 
Wisconsin Power and Light 
Company and in 1989 the 
highest-ranking black execu
tive in the United States, 
graduated from the University 
in 1965 with a degree in elec
trical engineering.
It was in the years 1965 to 
1970, says Young, that [the 
University] realized it was 
important to to recruit blacks, 
and other minority students 
as well.
Although Young says it was 
not the administrations only 
effort to recruit black stu
dents, in 1968 the University 
responded to increasing con
cerns about the ability of mi
nority students to attend 
Carnegie Mellon by forming 
the Carnegie Mellon Action 
Project.
CMAP is intended to 
strengthen the academic 
preparation of minority stu
dents and to speed their ad
justment to the Carnegie 
Mellon curriculum.

ANALYSIS
By A. J. DURAZZI
Tartan Features Editor
Two and a half years 
ago, 37 black students 
stormed the Student 
Affairs office demand
ing a greater recogni
tion of Carnegie Mellons ethnic diver
sity.
Today, the successors of the protestors 
may not be raising a public outcry, but 
they are disappointed by what they feel 
are broken promises. Disappointed that 
the administration has not moved fast 
enough  or strongly enough  to ad
dress what they see as persistent prob
lems at the University.
The students during the1988-89 school 
year, led by Spirits then-president Nicole 
Austin and then-executive vice president 
Michael Bowman, cited examples of ra
cial insensitivity on the campus. The 
reason why were here is insensitivity, 
insensitivity by students and adminis
tration, said Bowman at the time.
Later in that academic year, students 
again protested incidents they called 
racial harassment from Campus Police. 
Administrative reaction to that com
plaint, at least, was swift; Campus Police 
Chief J&mes LaPaglia stated in the 
March 21,1989 issue of The Tartan that 
some officers in the department had gone 
through training in Cultural Awareness 
and Ethnic Intimidation. Later in the 
month, 24 additional officers attended 
the same training.
As a result of these incidents and other 
requests in March 1989, Richard Cyert, 
then president of the University, created 
the Human Relations Commission. The 
[HRC].is to ... see if the mechanisms of 
the institution are working. Its not an 
investigative body, its not a jury panel. 
Its an advisory board., says Vice 
President for Enrollment William Elliott, 
who chairs the HRC.
The student protestors submitted 
several petitions throughout the 1988- 
89 academic year. Their complaints were 
grouped into four basic categories: cur
ricular changes they felt were necessary 
within H&SS; the creation of an ethnic 
studies section in Hunt Library; the de
velopment of a required course in ethnic 
diversity for freshmen; and the recruit
ment of black faculty.
Changing the H&SS curriculum
In 1989, students submitted lists of 
texts they felt needed to be added to the 
courses Introduction to World History, 
Development of American Society, and 
Western Civilization. They also asked 
the H&SS faculty to create new history 
courses dealing with ethnicity, and to re
instate a course in the Department of 
Social and Decision Sciences, Social In
fluences.
Today, black student leaders say the 
changes have been minimal.
There really isnt much available ex
cept for African American History I and 
II, says applied history senior Desiree
Brad Walter and Lois Cox, then dean and 
associate dean of Student Affairs, listen 
to black student grievances at a meeting 
in Doherty Hall 2210 in October 1988.

quests by re-evaluating the courses of

Twenty-six years ago, a brilliant social 
theorist, debater, and activist was as
sassinated in Harlem, New York. The 
corpse was Malcolm X, but the victim 
was all of American society  black as 
well as white, according to Lerone 
Bennett, senior editor ofEbony magazine.
Bennett was on campus Thursday 
night, the anniversary of Malcolm Xs 
death, as a part of CMUs Black History 
Month celebration. His talk was spon
sored by Spirit and CMAP.
Bennett expressed his excitement in 
coming to CMU. I was astounded when 
my agent told me that a Ms. Cook wanted
me to say something about Malcolm X 
today.... I had to come to Pittsburgh and 
meet this Ms. Cook. I was astonished 
that young people remember Malcolm 
X, he said.
If you remember one thing about 
Malcolm X, said Bennett, remember 
this: Malcolm X was a street cat convict 
in jail in Massachusetts, and he took a 
two-bit, dime-store dictionary and edu
cated himself. He became a debater, a 
thinker, one of the greatest minds this 
country ever produced. After reminisc
ing about the personal effects of Malcolm 
Xs death and an ensuing moment of 
silence, Bennett addressed the subject of 
Black History Month.
Bennett quoted from the only conver
sation hed ever had with Malcolm X, a 4 
am get-together where a mutual friend 
introduced them. In response to Bennetts 
protests about the lateness of the hour, 
the friend replied, Malcolm never 
sleeps. One of the first things Malcolm 
X said during that conversation was, 
I'm reading history tonight. I dont know 
enough about the worries and the tri
umphs and the troubles in our life.
The purpose of historical analysis, ac
cording to Bennett, is not to play with 
names, dates, and facts, but to increase 
awareness. He stressed the need for 
education, not only to educate others but 
to educate oneself. Bennetts central 
theme is what he calls common his
tory, or merging the known history of
America with the histories of various 
immigrated cultures and recognizing, he 
said, their contributions.
The biggest secret about American 
history is that American history does not 
exist, he said. According to Bennett, 
American history as it is traditionally 
taught does not adequately emphasize 
the contributions made by the different 
ethnic groups that comprise American 
society.
On the level of history and culture, all 
Americans are at least part black, said 
Bennett. You cant fully understand 
George Washington until you understand 
his slaves. Black history is inextricable 
[from] the history of the American people,

rican American history.
I dont know whether any 
changes resulted, Stearns says 
concerning the methods of teach
ing the sections of African 
American history. One of the 
concerns was the coverage of Af
rican history. I issued a handout 
to supplement African history in 
the Intro to World History course, 
he says.
But Bowman, who graduated 
last May, says that the supple
ment is not what students had in 
mind. Thats not enough, he told 
The Tartan in a phone interview 
this weekend.
H&SS Dean Stephen Fienberg 
says Social Influences was not 
reinstated, as the students had 
requested, because of difficulties 
that the department of Social and 
Decision Sciences had with the 
course.
Fienberg says that courses are 
offered at the discretion of the 
instructor, adding, however, that 
a new course in the history de
partment did result in part from 
student requests. There is a new 
course this semester in the Asian 
American experience ... that re
sulted from discussions after the 
initial request.... It is quite excit
ing, he says.
Ethnicity in Modern America, 
taught by Susan Ambrose in the 
History Department, covers, she 
says, recent immigration pat
terns, especially focused on Asian 
Americans.
Increasing library holdings
Last October, the HRC released 
a report summarizing its effort 
since it began holding meetings 
in November 1989. According to 
this report, there is an extensive 
collection of African American and 
African history videotapes now
available in Hunt Library.
There have been a lot of pur
chases made, says Susan 
Sprague, head of administrative 
services at Hunt Library.
According to Thom as Michalak, 
director of the university librar
ies, the administration has been 
working to meet student demand. 
This summer we spent $10,000 
to buy materials, he says. We 
did it in the early 80s with science 
fiction when students felt we 
needed to develop that. We have a 
lot more material than meets the 
eye.
Although students in 1988-89 
petitioned for an ethnic studies 
section in the library, Michalak 
says that the recent acquisitions 
fall into many different areas, 
and instead of a collection area, 
the new books are placed with 
their appropriate call numbers.
Making a diversity course
Last spring, H&SS offered a 
University Scholars course called 
Diversity, American Society, and 
Americas Campuses. The course 
was taught by Elliott, English 
Department Head Alan Kennedy, 
and Linda Watkins.
According to Cook and H&SS 
sophomore Blanchee Smith, the 
course was supposed to be the 
beginning of the development of a 
required course in diversity for 
all university freshmen.
It was supposed to be imple
mented as a core course for all 
students entering into the uni
versity, despite which college they . 
were entering, says Smith, who 
took the course. And Bill Elliott 
was supposed to see that it was 
implemented.
Cook did not take the course, 
but continued to be concerned for 
its implementation. I think Bill 
Elliott is a hindrance to its
progress, says Cook. He said to 
me personally that it would be 
instituted, I didnt have to worry 
about it, I could stop asking him, 
it would be a part of the curricu
lum  and where is it?
Elliott says he never made such 
a statement. I did not say that I 
would make it a required course. 
Thats a simple declarative sen
tence. If you think about why that 
is, I dont set the curriculum for 
the university, says Elliott.
Cook maintains that the course 
was promised to be a core re
quirement. I think it was a for
mality to shut us up, I dont think 
it was ever taken seriously, says 
Cook. Do you think that if [Elliott] 
told us back then that it would be 
just a trial course we would have 
gone for that? No.
Fienberg agrees that the course 
was a offered as a one-time course
 a University Scholars seminar 
which is a program that offers 
inter-disciplinary courses with the 
intention of exploration between 
disciplines for the students.
There was an enormous 
amount of primarily upper-level 
students ... whose goal it was to 
discuss the contents of a course 
that might be considered as a core 
requirement, says Fienberg. 
There are no curricular recom
mendations in my office. The 
students in that course set a whole 
other agenda.
What we had originally talked 
about... [was] coming up with a 
curriculum that might fit into the 
H&SS core, says Fienberg. We 
are in the very first stages of core 
curriculum revision. We havent 
rejected [the diversity course], but 
there isnt a suggestion on the 
table, there are no active discus
sions.
According to Fienberg, the re
view process required for a new 
course is elaborate and time
consuming. Its a multi-year pro
cess, he says. Its an excellent 
opportunity for student input and 
one that is not being exercised by 
the students. Id love to get more 
student input and reaction. We 
dont get enough.
I was pleased to see the course 
happen on campus, says Smith. 
I think that diversity needs to be 
dealt with as a field of study.... 
Now, keep the diversity course, 
push for more.
Recruiting black faculty
The issue of recruitment of black 
faculty has not yet been dealt 
with to the satisfaction of the stu
dents and some administrators.
According to Cook, Spirit sub
mitted a proposal for recruitment 
in 1988. Its been two and a half 
years, she says. They say that 
there are not enough black aca
demicians for us to recruit. There 
are, if we really wanted to recruit 
... a diverse faculty. They have 
the ability, intelligence, man
power, and money.
According to Elliott, .recruit
ment of black faculty is being ad
dressed. There are more black 
faculty members here today than 
there were when that incident 
took place, so obviously the ag
gressive nature of Carnegie 
Mellon to attract black faculty 
members to Carnegie Mellon 
surely hasnt deteriorated or de
cayed since then, says Elliott. 
N ow, if the question is, Are there 
as many black faculty members 
as wed like to have? then the 
answer is no. 
In addition, Elliott says that 
there is a an interim program to 
fill the need for black faculty until 
something more permanent is 
done. [It] basically brought vis
iting black faculty members here 
as a way to at least do something
in the interim and that program 
continues, he says.
Former Spirit President 
Terence Yarde, a senior in SDS, 
says that CMU has a good start in 
dealing with these issues. Its far 
from where it should be, but I 
think they made a good start, he 
sayg. I think the crucial thing 
right now is recruitment of black 
facility. If youre a black student 
and you come to a predominantly 
white university, its discourag
ing to look up and theres hardly 
any black faculty.
Despite this good start, Yarde 
is still wary of the Universitys 
plans. The University rises to 
the occasion for the moment, but 
follow-through is sometimes 
lacking, he says.
Associate Provost Barbara 
Lazarus says the University has 
been working to recruit minority 
faculty. There is a special fund to 
help recruit junior and senior 
African American faculty mem
bers, she says. Since [the student 
protests in 1988], weve created a 
new position of assistant Vice 
President of Enrollment who 
takes care of recruiting minority 
faculty members, says Lazarus. 
According to Dean of Student 
Affairs Michael Murphy, that po
sition was created before the fall 
semester in 1988. Sanford Rivers, 
who fills the position, was not 
available for comment.
Lazarus also claims the Uni
versity has set up programs to 
encourage current minority 
undergrads at Carnegie Mellon 
to attend graduate school, as well 
as to encourage graduate students 
here to continue in the academic 
world.
Given all that [weve done], 
weve still just begun. We have to 
continue to work all the time to 
increase the pool and sustain what 
we have here, says Lazarus.
One program that was deveV 
oped before the 1988-89 protests 
was the Minority Teaching 
search Fellowship Program. Tti^ 
program is run by Jay Devine of 
H&SS. The goal is encourage 
minority students to go on 
graduate school, says Devine' 
and hopefully return to the fiel(J 
of teaching.
With regard to the recruitment' 
of black faculty, Director of ICT 
versity Planning Jeff Bolton says1' 
From my recollection, its been 
pretty stable. There hasnt been 
any real change [in the number of1 
black faculty in the last tw/1 
years].
Many people, according to 
Smith, are quick to turn blacj? 
students to CMAP.
According to CMAP Director 
Gloria Hill, CMAP plays a minor! 
role in recruiting black students' 
to come to CMU. We assist with 
recruitment, she says, but tha|$ 
a University concern. All students 
go through the Admissions office.?'
Ethnic learning, Hill feels, is aii. 
important topic for all students'1 
not just blacks. I think to sent 
any student coming out of this 
university without knowing the 
value and richness of ethnicity? 
is to send him out uneducated^11 
she says.
Spirit has played a vital role uv 
advocating these changes. [TKe 
protests] took up a lot of our tim es
says Cook. We are students first." 
As president, I tell my members 
that we have to graduate first, its 
not our duty, its tjie 
administrations. 
Bowman summed up the ur
gency he feels for the university* 
to recruit more faculty. As weF 
move into the 21st century, tlie! 
majority of people in this country 
will be people of color. How is; 
Carnegie Mellon preparing for 
that?

Three new ways to survive college.

The Macintosh Classic
With Apples introduction of three new 
Macintosh* computers, meeting the challenges of college 
life just got a whole lot easier. Because now; everybody 
can afford a Macintosh.
The HllMIHWKIrc&iM is our most 
affordable model, yet it comes with everything you needincluding a hard disk drive.The KUHIMBIBB 
combines color capabilities with affordability. And the 
HEESE1 is perfect for students who need a 
computer with extra power and expandability.
No matter which Macintosh you choose, you'll 
have a computer that lightens your work load without

The Macinlosh lisi
giving you another tough subject to learn. Every Macintosh 
computer is easy to set up and even easier to master. And 
when youve learned one program,youre well on your 
way to learning them all. Thats because thousands of avail
able programs all work in the same, consistent manner. 
You can even share information with someone who uses a 
different type of computer-thanks to Apples versatile 
SuperDriver which reads from and writes to Macintosh, 
MS-DOS, OS/2, and Apple II floppy disks.

Study abroad remains 
strong despite war
We had heard rumors of terrorists 
threatening an SAS flight to Kennedy.
I wasn't on that flight, but I was wor
ried. I told my Danish mother, and she 
said Oh, you Americans! You're al
ways overreacting.' "

Carnegie Mellons study abroad 
,rograms are alive and well, depite the war in the Persian Gulf, 
fft'e'recent initiation of Operaon Desert Storm has unleashed 
i torrent of worries amongparents 
' students concerning the 
fety and prudence of study 
tbroad programs.
CMU currently has two foreign 
xchange programs. The major 
Ingram operates at a technical 
|Chool in Lusanne, Switzerland, 
ile the other program is in 
Fofcyo at Keio University. Apiroximately six students are in
volved in the Lusanne program, 
v]jile only one student is studyng at Keio.
Aside from these two study 
bWad exchanges, there are a 
lumber of programs in which 
tudents participate indepenently. Students involved in inlependent studies abroad are 
nostly scattered throughout Euope, although there are some in 
ither areas of the world, 
goth students and parents are 
:oncerned with the safety of 
pending a semester or more in 
urope because of its proximity
o the Persian Gulf. However, 
amegie Mellon officials and of
iciis at other universities are 
till encouraging students to study 
ibroad and are attempting to 
issuge any fears that students 
night have.
Dr. William Elliott, vice presietof enrollment at CMU, says, 
To the best of my knowledge, 
here are no students expressing
any real concern over the situa
tion abroad.
Elliott adds that CMU is not 
planning to cancel any of its for
eign study or exchange programs 
and will not deter students from 
applying for such programs. If I 
were a student, I certainly would 
go abroad, he says.
Thea Brandfon, a senior English 
major, echoes Elliotts sentiments 
about traveling abroad.
Brandfon, who studied in Den
mark during the fall of1989, says, 
Theres no real reason not to go. 
You should definitely apply and 
continue with any plans that you 
might have.
Stephen Feinberg, dean of 
H&SS, believes that CMUs 
newest program, located in Tours, 
France, is a very safe place to 
travel. We remain cautious, were 
concerned, and were monitoring 
things very closely. But I think 
that Tours is a safer place to be 
than a lot of places in the United 
States, he says. Tours is a very 
safe location. It is not the place 
where you see a lot of demon
strations and threats.
According to Barbara Freed, 
head of the Modem Languages 
Department, applications for the 
Tours program are being accepted 
until March 15. This deadline has 
been extended, and any interested 
students still have an opportunity 
to apply. Freed says, Were con
fident that a great deal of care 
and attention will be given to 
[students] in the Tours program. 
Its important for them to know 
that.
In addition, Freed says that 
although one year of college 
French is necessary to participate 
in the program, she is more than 
willing to work out a different 
arrangement for students who 
have not had one year of French, 
so that they can participate in the 
program as well. For example, if 
there is enough student interest, 
an intensive French language 
course will be offered during the 
summer.
The Tours school, which will be 
run by Carnegie Mellon, offers 
about 10 courses in areas like art 
history, history, and literature.

But this is not the only example of 
a toy which indirectly presents 
the cynicism of modem times. 
Another doll, the aptly-named 
Baby Sparkles, looks to all like 
the standard-issue infant replica, 
right? Wrong, because when the 
batteries are placed inside Baby 
Sparkles, a series of multicolored 
light bulbs implanted underneath 
the toys translucent plastic skin 
begin to flash on and off. The 
effect is that the baby acquires 
the look of a mutant homunculous 
plagued by huge, pulsating sub
cutaneous necrotic lesions.
To make matters worse, the face 
on the Baby Sparkles doll has 
been molded into a huge satanic 
grin. Are toymakers' trying to 
teach children that one can main
tain a sunny outlook in the face of 
genetic mutation brought on by 
radiation, toxic waste or chemical 
warfare? Perhaps, however, these 
fears are far less grounded in re
ality than the fears addressed by 
another, somewhat more pedes
trian baby-doll type.
I cant remember her name, but 
she is a crawling baby type, with 
one distinguishing feature. After 
crawling several feet, this baby 
doll stumbles, tries in vain to get 
up once more and weeps uncon
trollably.
What is it that has compelled 
toymakers to send this genera
tion so clear a message concern
ing the futility of all human ac
tion? Why didnt they just cut to 
the chase and call it Baby Kafka?
Is it just me, or has the toy 
industry become a refuge for 
leaders of the existentialist 
movement?
Personally, I am waitingfor the 
arrival of a baby dqll which, upon 
being activated, crawls away from 
the owner, not stopping until it 
returns to the factory from whence 
it came. The doll would be named 
Baby Victim Blamer, because 
whenever any distraught children

arrive at the factory, claiming that 
the thing they most cherish has 
left them forever, they would 
promptly be told that It was 
probably something you did.
The baby-doll market is not the 
only market in which children 
are exposed to the harsh realities 
of life. For years, the bread and 
butter of the toymakers arsenal 
has been exactly that, the arsenal.
I will not waste any valuable 
ink claiming that I do not under
stand the proliferation of heavily 
armed action figure-type toys. I 
am, after all, a child of the gen
eration that started it all by pur
chasing a glut of heavily armed 
Star Wars action figures  to 
claim that the whole Teenage 
Mutant Ninja Turtles phenom
enon is beyond my grasp would be 
hypocritical.
The fact is that the industrial 
accident origin which makes up 
the story of the Teenage Mutant 
Ninja Turtles has paved the way 
for an underhanded new honesty 
in product advertisement. In 
marketing their Teenage Mutant 
Ninja Turtle Pies, Hostess, a 
company which probably spent 
years trying to keep this truth
from getting out into the world, 
now freely claims that their prod
uct is covered in Radioactive 
Ooze. It seems ironic that these 
heroes on the half shell would be 
the ones to cause the truth about 
the beloved Twinkie to come out.
But if Hostess leads the van
guard in making children com
fortable with the fact that societys 
current self-destructive course 
may cause them all to be covered 
in radioactive ooze, other compa
nies are pulling their share in 
getting children ready for the re
alities of adult life. For years, 
cereal companies have spent vast 
amounts of money in giving chil
dren the vital rhetorical skills 
needed in order to convince an
other party that what is worst is
exactly what they should getif 
there is a central message in all 
cereal advertising it is this hey 
kids, here are the arguments you 
must use on your parents if you 
want to get the nifty toy surprise

companies are doing their best to 
instruct the next generation of 
lawyers in the art of prospecting 
for loopholes.

J a complete and nutritious breakfast.
 Think about that phrase, part of a com
plete and nutritious breakfast. It al
most sounds convincing, except that as I 
watched the commercial, my roommate 
was gracious enough to point out that 
the table is part of a nutritious and 
healthy breakfast, and probably richer 
in nutrients than Sugar Frosted Goo
Puffs.
But perhaps the most egregious intel
lectual crime is currently being perpe
trated by the makers of Life Savers candy. 
Life Savers were my favorite candy as a 
youngster, and yet, the fact that the Life 
Saver company has now taken to mar
keting tiny knobs of candy as Life Saver 
Holes has caused me great distress. The 
reason for my discontent not only lies in 
that by manufacturing Life Saver Holes,
the Life Saver company is implying the 
existence of Life Savers as entities in 
nature which are harvested and then 
punctured, but it also lies in that by 
creating Life Saver holes, the Life Saver 
company is creating the illusion that 
nothingness is a valuable entity rather 
than an absence.
I will not hazard a guess about what 
constitutes the intellectual agenda of 
the Life Saver company. Maybe they are
striving to breed a generation so mired in 
subjectivism that they are incapable of 
individual thought, or maybe, in pre
senting these tiny bits of candy in their 
own, specially designed, environmentally 
unsafe containers, they are trying to get 
the candy-eating children of the United 
States used to the fact that they are 
going to have to get used to living with 
less.
In any event, the message that the
toys, foods, and entertainment the chil
dren of this country are mindlessly con
suming is a simple onethe ever-worsening quality of our life should be no 
excuse to miss out on part of a complete 
and nutritious breakfast.

Chiodos Tavern teaches a lesson in the American Dream
Just beyond the Homestead 
Steel Mills and over the bridge 
are a tavern and a man.
Together, the tavern and the 
man embrace the likes of Prohibi
tion, World War II, Homestead 
Steel, the value of a quality 
product, and the reality of the 
American Dream.
Higher education teaches-some 
of us that the American Dream is 
intangible, something that doesnt 
truly exist outside the minds of 
naive and misinformed patriots 
 a hollow vision or mirage. But 
then, we dont have too many 
classes in taverns, now do we? I 
might be on to something.
Walk into Chiodos Tavern, look 
for a guy who slightly resembles 
Tommy Lasorda, and youll 
probably end up shaking owner 
Joe Chiodos hand. Tell him your 
name and he just might buy you a 
drink. My father always said it 
always pays to be nice. Nice to 
nice, he says. Joe, a southern 
Italian immigrant, takes dads 
advice to heart, times two.
Whether hes handing out 
Kennedy half dollars to hordes of 
Russian visitors so that they 
could bring it back with them, or 
just chatting on a lazy afternoon, 
Joe finds time to spread merri
ment. Think youve lived a little? 
Bored with life? Grab a beverage, 
sit back, and listen to Joes story, 
a study in zest.
Joe didnt want to swamp me, 
so he started on the perimeter  
Prohibition. I bought the place 
in 1947, but during the speak
easy5 days it was owned by a couple 
of guys, Tom and Joe Kelley.
I couldnt help but wonder how 
the tavern served booze during 
Prohibition, so I pressed Joe for 
an answer.
They had a deal with the Re
publican mayor; he lived across 
the street. Of course, how could I 
be so stupid? In 33 the bar opened 
legally again, but it turned into, 
like, an old-time saloon. It had a 
trough and you could spit right on 
the floor. A guy would come out 
and hose it down when it got bad.
As I listened to Joe talk, I gazed 
at the hundreds of relics which 
hung from the ceiling to form a 
thicket and covered the walls in 
layers. All the relics are gifts from 
customers who, many years ago, 
began an unusual tradition of 
giving, which offers as much cul
ture and education as any mu
seum or gallery  I dont care 
what the French say.

WHATEVER HAPPENED TO 
PLATINUM BLONDES?

tavern and I was going to turn it 
into a shoe store and repair place. 
But we cleaned it up and tried it 
as a bar first and it worked good, 
so I left it. Things were booming 
in Homestead at the time. Im a 
shoemaker by trade. The only 
shoemaker in the U.S. Army to 
ever receive a promotion right on 
the field.
Joe brought heart and soul, es
pecially the latter, to the wartime 
shoe outfit.
I was in charge of a 200-man 
outfit. We fixed soles with rubber 
tires, fixed galoshes with 
innertubes for the Battle of the 
Bulge. It was my idea; we had 
nothing else. When the general 
came to inspect, I showed the fellas 
what we were doing and he says, 
how would you like to become a 
lieutenant? You can get a break 
in life anywhere.
Making the quick buck isnt 
what Joes place is all about. His 
prices give people breaks in life 
every day. For a mere $1.50, a 
customer may treat himself to 
one of the most powerful taste 
delights in the Burgh: The Mys
tery Meat Sandwich. Today, you 
order a sandwich at a restaurant
and you could just about pick it up 
and look through it, said Joe. So 
through trials and tribulations I 
came up with this.
The sandwich is a mystery 
because the cook refuses to set 
the recipe, which may or may not 
include the kitchen sink as an 
ingredient, into stone. The Mys
tery Meat Sandwich, laid out on a 
hefty Kaiser, is as fine a blend of 
substance and flavor as the Tav
ern itself.
An old buddy salutes Joe on the 
way out, and the owner takes on 
a pensive look. There is one thing 
you could tell the young people 
thats the beauty of being in 
America. Being bom in Southern 
Italy, my father bringing me here, 
and going from a shoemaker to 
owning a business for 44 years. I 
dont think they have this in other

Rightist rednecks seize control of U.S. consciousness
In a time when patriotism is 
jfe throughout the country, one 
nay think more of the religious, 
eactionary South, rather than 
he less belligerent North. Why is
his?It seems hypocritical. Only a 
indredyears ago, the South was 
ebuilding its dashed economy 
yni reluctantly removing the 
hackles from its slaves, due to 
he Union armys destruction of 
loiithem lands and ideals. Yet 
Dany rebel flags still fly next to 
he state flags in capitals and 
minty seats. It has not been long 
nough for a lot of prejudice and 
littemess to die away between 
he: regions.
SOUTHERN COMFORT
_____________by Alison Carter
Look at the presidents and 
senators that, today, have risen 
up from the South to take major 
parts in the United States gov
ernment. The spotlight is now, 
more than ever, on one Southern 
senator from North Carolina, re
cently re-elected to his seat in the
Senate. It is also on our illustri
ous President  George Bush, a 
Texan.
Why is it that, over the last 20 
years, Southern politicians have 
gained so much power? Is it be
cause they no longer fear the Iron 
Hand of the Union, and fewer 
people than ever consider the 
South a potential enemy? Per
haps. I think that is part of the 
issue. But, now, why is there such 
a sudden surge of racism, 
homophobia, and fear, that, com
pared to today, was almost non
existent in the United States 10 
years ago?
The answer, folks, is that the 
South is successfully cashing in
on the attitude of trust that the 
North has given it after the Civil 
War.
The sore and awful truth is that 
the mostly rural South, rife with 
reactionary judgment and biblical 
thinking, is able to publicize and 
use the issues of today (abortion, 
AIDS, Mapplethorpe, pom, sod
omy, drugs, et cetera) in its sena
torial elections. It is using them 
to turn the United States into a 
fascist reflection of the intention 
of its original founders.
And I will tell you the sore and 
awful (and also secret, so keep 
this under your hat) truth. Jesse 
Helms is planning to run for 
President in a few years, and he is
gearing up the country to give 
him those votes which will make 
him the grand Poo-bah of fearmongering. Just let me tell you 
some of the bills which will be 
made and passed if he becomes 
President:
1. A Gay No Rights Bill.
2. Abill banning AIDS research, 
based on the attitude that anyone 
who uses IV needles or has gay or 
premarital sex does not really de
serve to live.
3. A bill requiring that all citi
zens must attend church and pay 
10 percent tithe of their personal 
income.
4. Abill that requires execution 
of all citizens who do not follow at
least nine of the Ten Command
ments.
Is that enough for you to be
come a Libertarian? It is for me.
This fearmongering announce
ment was brought to you courtesy 
of Stinking Left-wing Communist 
Anti-bible Immoral Hippies with 
Long Hair and Silly Round 
Glasses, Incorporated. Alison 
Carter was unable to write her 
column this week, and she has 
temporarily turned its contents 
over to us.
Thank you for your support.

CFA who enjoys playing with the 
minds of her readers.
3ennett: Malcolm X understood the importance of history
lENNETT, from page LI
lack and white.... The black experience 
as color, dye, a hold on the American 
xp'erience, he said.
Bennett added that African Amerian's have significantly influenced the 
ustory of the United States; however, he 
[aimed, history books ignore this fact. 
Sxamples of black ingenuity cited by 
ennett included inventions such as the 
otato chip, ice cream, sweet potato pie, 
arbecue sauce, the automatic stop light, 
ind jazz. Without the premise of jazz the 
dea of Elvis Presley, the Beatles, the 
lolling Stones, Fred Astaire, Paula 
bdul, John Travolta, Aaron Copeland, 
nd George Gershwin would be inconiivable, said Bennett.
Bennett emphasized two main points: 
need to realize we have a common 
istory and that black history is being 
ireatened. These threats pertain not 
nly to the social problems of poverty, 
rug abuse, and illiteracy, but also to the 
ersian Gulf crisis. According to Bennett, 
ne out of every three men and one out of 
very two women serving in the Gulf is 
lack. By all odds, they should have 
eeii annihilated by the shackles of slaery and segregation. But the miracle is 
iat so many have survived. We must not 
it that miracle die today, said Bennett.
We must deal with the slavery that is alive 
and well and walking the streets of Pitts
burgh.
 Lerone Bennett, 
______________senior editor of Ebony magazine
According to Bennett, four main tasks 
need to be taken up before there can be a 
full integration of all the threads that 
make up the beautiful history of 
America. A common history must be 
created. With his first point comes the 
secondthe creation of common history 
among the living. We must deal with 
the slavery that is alive and well and 
walking the streets of Pittsburgh, said 
Bennett.
Bennett also believes that people need 
to be freed from the false images of the 
past. He pointed out changes in the fash
ion industry that reaffirm the idea that 
black facial features are attractive. Re
cently, if youve noticed, the fashion 
editors have realized that large lips are 
beautiful. Weve all seen Kim Basinger. 
Black women can see that their lips are 
big, full, gorgeous, and lush. And theyre
supposed to be that way, said Bennett. 
They finally have the lips that theyre 
supposed to have and that they can fi
nally be proud of.
A fully integrated society must also, 
according to Bennett, encourage excel
lence  not only athletic, but economic, 
scientific, and technical excellence. 
When you are ignorant, the world is 
going to cheat you. If you are weak, the 
world is going to whip you, said Bennett. 
If you are a coward, the world is going to 
keep you running. Bennett stressed that 
overcoming these obstacles is the mark 
of excellence.
When questioned about how Carnegie 
Mellon could increase black enrollment 
and awareness of African-American cul
ture, Bennett said, Certain courses in 
African-American history and culture 
should be required of all students. It is
central to the understanding of America 
and it will help those students to under
stand themselves better.
Bennett believes that American uni
versities have lost ground since the ac
tivism of the 1960s because of neglect 
and lethargy. He stressed the need for 
organizations like CMAP and an increase 
in minority designated scholarships as 
crucial to the recruitment and cultivation 
of black enrollment in universities such 
as CMU.
Bennetts career has included report
ing for the Atlanta Daily World before 
moving up to city editor, serving as as
sociate editor for Jet and Ebony, and 
finally becoming senior editor of Ebony.
In addition, he has been a senior fel
low for the Institute of Black World and 
a visiting history professor at North
western University. Bennett has also 
written ten books and won several liter
ary awards, including the Patron Saints 
of the Society of Midland Authors for his 
Manner of Man: A Biography of Martin 
Luther King Jr.
Wayne Walters, a graduate student in 
music, agreed with Bennetts sentiments 
that the university needs to do more: 
Its a big issue here, and it has not been 
treated effectively.... Im not speaking 
about African culture, but all culture in
general, and making it a more diverse 
environment. Its needed for the full de
velopment of the student, especially be
ing a minority in a predominantly white 
environment.
Ersula Cosby, a freshman in H&SS, 
agreed that there should be a multi
cultural required course. It should be a 
required course for all freshmen. I know 
that Penn State has it and that it is 
possible, said Cosby.
The emotion that Bennett evoked was 
so powerful that Vesta Hodges, a fresh
man IM major, said, It almost made me 
cry. The whole plight of African Ameri
cans today  sometimes it seems like it 
will never change. I think, what can I do? 
But up to this point I really couldnt say. 
It seems like such a big problem. Some
day well all have to come together. 
The American tragedy is that we know 
so little about each other, said Bennett. 
This tied to his theme of self-education 
about the common history. If March 1 
comes, and were the same black people 
and white people we were on January 31, 
and we havent changed, we have failed, 
said Bennett. Despite all the work that 
may be prescribed for Americas race 
relations, Bennett ended his speech with 
hope: Members, dont get weary, for the 
works almost done.
Dont let travel fears nix study abroad plans, say promoters
TUDY ABROAD, from page L3
owever, participants in the 
ours program can take classes 
any of the neighboring institu
ons, which include courses in 
elds from art to engineering. 
Richard Cleary, an associate 
rofessor of architecture, is workalong with Brandfon, to coorinte a forum concerning study 
)road.
The forum, titled How Study 
broad Changed My Life, will be 
eld the first week in March, says 
randfon. It is to be conducted by
a panel of students who have 
traveled abroad, and it has a dual 
purpose. The first is to answer 
general questions concerning for
eign study programs and to gen
erate interest for the new Tours 
program. The second objective is 
to get students who have traveled 
abroad to share their experiences 
with each other and with others.
Our hope is that this forum 
can inspire people to really take a 
look at studying abroad, says 
Brandfon.
Brandfon recalls an experience
while traveling abroad that con
firms Americans overreaction to 
situations around the world. She 
describes anticipating her flight 
home from Denmark to Kennedy 
Airport in New York.
It was one year after the Pan 
Am event, and we had heard ru
mors of terrorists threatening an 
SAS flight to Kennedy, she says. 
I wasnt on that flight, but I was 
worried. I told my Danish mother, 
and she said Oh, you Americans! 
Youre always overreacting. 
The Danish womans statement
made sense to Brandfon, who re
alized there was nothing to worry 
about as long as people follow a 
few simple guidelines. Brandfons 
advice to American students 
traveling abroad is very similar 
to that in a memo sent by Brown 
University officials. Both 
Fienberg and Elliot have said that 
a similar memo will be issued by 
Carnegie Mellon.
Browns memo suggests that 
American students keep a low 
profile while attending schools in 
foreign countries. First, students
should not call special attention 
to the fact that they are Ameri
cans. They should avoid getting 
into public arguments about the 
war and should not participate in 
any demonstrations.
A second piece of advice that 
both Brandfon and Brown offi
cials give is to avoid places which 
are known to be frequented by 
Americans.
In addition, students should not 
open any packages from uniden
tified senders; they should not 
leave their belongings unattended
at any time. The list of precau
tions basically emphasizes com
mon sense.
Brandfon still thinks that trav
eling abroad is a great idea. Al
though right now it pays to be 
more cautious than you were be
fore, security is always much 
tighter in Europe than here, she 
says.
Theyre used to [terrorist 
threats] over there. Its easy to 
blow things out of proportion. Y ou 
shouldnt let whats going on in
terfere in study abroad plans.

DIVERSIONS
Dont listen to He Said, She Said
BylMARNI BOREK
Fafltah Assistant Diversions Editor
Love is an over-used theme in todays 
movies. Sure, the famous Rhett Butler 
and Scarlett OHara passionate kiss 
lies have given audiences the sudden 
ur^e to sweep their mates off their feet 
and blow passionately into their ears, 
ibutithat was in the golden ages.
foday we are plagued with films about 
commitment and the stereotypical roles 
of men and women in safe sex rela
tionships. He Said, She Said is a perfect 
example of a relationship movie that will 
gjvfc any hormonally stable adult male 
and female nightmares about monogamy 
and the opposite sex.
He Said, She Said begins with the male/ 
female relationship conflict seen in When 
Harry Met Sally . Dan Hanson (Kevin 
Bacon) and Lorie Bryer (Elizabeth 
Pei^ins) are struggling Baltimore Sun 
journalists who cant seem to get along. 
Hejs the Julio Iglesias of the newspaper
 u&ing his charm to score with every 
woman in the office. She is determined to 
write for The New York Times and al
though she wont admit it, shes curious 
about the rumor of him being good in 
bed. After they are forced to share a 
newspaper column, both he and she 
fin<| themselves feeling warmly toward 
icji other.
After Dan packs up his pajamas and 
moves into Lories place, the viewer is 
left with many questions: Will Dan and 
Lome pursue a monogamous relation
ship? Will work and romance mix well 
for the both of them? Will Lorie find out

if the rumor about Dans sexual prowess 
is true?
The subject of the movie is as boring as 
warm milk. We all know that warm milk 
without the cookie isnt worth the late 
night digestive process. This movie, 
without a creative touch, is not worth the 
six dollars. The basic stereotypical rehash 
about the man unwilling to have a com
mitment and the woman wanting a dia
mond ring, three kids, and a house in the 
suburbs is utterly repulsive.
Dan is portrayed as a womanizer who 
finds women with cavernous cleavage to 
be most sophisticated. Lorie is a sweet 
and serious female with constant pre
menstrual depression tendencies. Please, 
arent theater audiences tired of these 
sort of characters? This is not the type of 
movie to which one drags a romantic 
interest. There will be no sudden rev
elations and marriage proposals in the 
theater aisles after the credits have 
rolled. The only thing the movie might 
provoke is the urge to utilize the dark 
atmosphere by enjoying some intimate 
time with a partner.
Bacon and Perkins are indeed excel
lent performers, but were not used to 
their best potential in the production.
Bacon seems to be eternally stuck play
ing the paranoid relationship man. In 
his hilarious role in Shes Having a Baby, 
Bacon has a nightmarish fantasy at the 
altar about what marriage is going to do 
to his life.
In He Said, She Said ,Bacon has an
other one of these fantasies in an Italian 
restaurant (the only thing on the menu 
is monogamy  without a side order of 
sex). Unfortunately for Bacon, these 
interludes do not work a second time 
around and neither does his role as the 
confused male. Lets face it, Kev, its time 
to move on.
Elizabeth Perkins had a few difficulties 
in her role as well. As a modern-day 
Mary Tyler Moore shes a huge flop. 
What happened to the energy and the 
grand bitchiness she showed in the 
movies Big and About Last Night...! In 
He Said, She Said all she does is smile, 
pout, and look as if shes waiting for 
Bacon to break out into a rendition of 
Van Morrisons Brown-Eyed Girl. One 
can certainly understand a performers 
desire to move on to more serious roles, 
but when someone as brassy as Perkins 
lowers herself into a role that is better 
roughage than oat bran, there are going 
to be negative results.
There are not many wonderful things 
to say about the movie, but if there was 
one thing to be lauded it would be di
rectors Ken Kwapis and Marisa Silvers 
idea to show the journalists relationship 
from both the male and female perspec
tive. This failed due to the rough tran
sition between what he says and she 
says. The directors show the develop

ment of Dan Hanson to be more promi
nent, while Lorie Bryer remains a con
stant throughout the film. Despite these 
flaws, Kwapis and Silver must be given 
the Siskel and Ebert thumbs up for a 
concept that has much potential if it 
were to be picked up by more ingenious 
directors (hint, hint, Mr. Allen).
He Said, She Said should send a strong 
message to those big Hollywood produc
ers. It is time to rid the film world of the 
romantic rubbish that has decreased 
movie audiences and increased the VCR 
audiences renting Gone With the Wind. 
This is a prime moment to go forth into 
the field and discover what relationships 
are really all about. Dr. Ruth is not 
needed for such a task. It would be best 
to find out what he and she really 
said.
Not even Allen and Midler 
can save Scenes From A Mall
ietjer Midler and Woody Allen injure an innocent mime (Bill Irwin) In Scenes From A Mall.
cJom the home office in Pittsburgh. Penn...
By MARK A. ROCES
Tartan Staffwriter
Global warming and world un
rest  these are the things that 
bring about premonitions of the 
end of the world. But the most 
disturbing pre-apocalyptic sign 
has surely come, and that is when 
the extraordinary mingles with 
the ordinary, as has happened 
with Woody Allens work in Scenes 
from a Mall.
This movie is nothing more than 
a gift from Allen to writer, direc
tor, and producer Paul Mazursky, 
who deserves no such charity. 
Allen and the usually hilarious 
Bette Midler star as a California 
couple who stop by the mall to get 
a few things for the celebration of 
their 16th wedding anniversary, 
and wind up getting a little more 
than they expected.
Mazursky may not have in
tended this, but the audience goes 
through the same predicament as 
the couple. Nick and Deborah 
Fifer (Allen and Midler) seem to 
have a happy marriage and happy 
careers. Nick is a successful sports

lawyer, and Deborah a psycholo
gist enjoying the successes of her 
new book on marriage.
In fact, their marriage is going 
so well that Nick feels he can tell 
his wife that hes been having an 
affair for the past six months. 
Needless to say, things are not 
going that well. The audience at 
this point, all excited at seeing 
what should be one of the most 
brilliant comedy duos of the de
cade, soon discovers that they too 
are being cheated on.
By the time Deborah reveals 
her own predictable bit of news to 
Nick, anything that was remark
ably funny about this movie has 
been used up. Mazursky then re
lies on a mime (Bill Irwin) to carry 
the rest of the movie, whos sole
job is to annoy the arguing couple 
throughout their stay at the mall. 
The mime ends up doing his job a 
little too well, as he not only gets 
in the way of the couple, but he 
also gets in the way of the entire 
movie.
Be warned that this is not the 
Midler that were used to seeing. 
Her character is not outlandishly 
larger than life. In turn, Mazursky 
robs the movie and the audience 
of a powerful comic tool. This is 
not to say anything against 
Midlers acting ability, but only 
that Mazursky fails to live up to 
the responsibility of writing fun
nier dialogue for a Midler.
The true Allen is also absent 
from the movie. What we get in
stead is a wax figure  only the 
semblance of Allen. Gone is the 
intellectually outrageous chatter, 
capable of drawing roars of 
laughter. Mazursky instead de
pends on Allens presence to fill in 
the void left by his mundane story. 
Not even Allen is so funny as to 
draw laughter by his presence 
alone  at least not intentionPlease see MALL, Page L17

Well, I have a theory that goes 
niethinglike this: change is only 
ecessary when something isnt 
[owdng. And in TV land, when 
0l^ething isnt working, its 
dually the result of a bad proraJnming decision.

deteriorate. It received okay rat
ings on NBC, but CBS saw an 
established hit that could help its 
Saturday night lineup. Wrong. 
The Hogans went out with one of 
its worst episodes ever: an insult
ing attempt to deal with AIDS 
seriously.
#4: Grand, NBC. Carsey/ 
Werner got lucky with a couple of 
big hits: Roseanne and The Cosby 
Show. They werent so lucky with 
this one, but because of the names 
involved, NBC gave the show a 
miracle renewal. Changes were 
made for the new season: all the 
good stuff was removed, and all 
the bad stuff was made more
prominent. Its surprising that the 
show lasted until December.
#3: Fox. This network made so 
many bad decisions that it would 
be impossible to list them sepa
rately. Granted, moving The 
Simpsons to Thursday was prob
ably one of the smartest and 
boldest programming moves of the 
year, and the Sunday night lineup 
with In Living Color and Married 
... with Children has survived 
nicely.
But the bad outweighs the good. 
First of all, Fox tried to expand to 
five nights of programming after 
cancelling most of its existing 
shows. For some inexplainable 
reason, Fox canceled shows that 
had built a small but loyal fol
lowing, most notably Alien Na
tion and 21 Jump Street. (Street 
has become a hit in first-run 
syndication.)
The cancellations wouldnt have 
been so bad if there had been any 
programming to replace them. 
Most of the fall premieres were a 
study in bad television: Babes, 
DEA, Against the Law, Good Grief,
Beverly Hills 90210. Fox is not in 
the position for a complete over
haul; in fact, all but one of these 
shows are still on the air due to 
the lack of backup programming.
Take Babes, for example. This 
sitcom is rude, obnoxious, and, 
worst of all, not funny. But it has 
managed to hold onto the valuable 
post-Simpsons slot, even though 
it loses more than half of the au
dience every week. Its going to be 
hard for Fox to get more 
viewership in that time period 
now that people are used to 
switching to A Different World.
Fox better have some good 
backups in preparation: It is re
gressing rather than progressing. 
It needs a new hit soon, or its 
threat to the Big Three will be 
nothing more than a dream.
#2: Friday night, NBC. Trying 
to gain ratings on a night it had 
lost for years, NBC moved three 
established hits to new time peri
ods: Quantum Leap at 8, Night 
Court at 9, and Midnight Caller 
at 10. All three fell and fell hard.
Quantum Leap was just begin
ning to find an audience on 
Wednesdays when it was moved. 
All but Sams most diehard fans 
stopped watching: after all, kids 
rule the set on Fridays (ABCs 
Full House and Family Matters 
have become unmovable power
houses).
Night Court was doing fine on 
Wednesdays, eking out a victory 
over Doogie Howser in 1989-90. 
The shift of Harry and the gang to 
Fridays was doubly deadly for 
NBC: Not only was Night Court 
demolished by Perfect Strangers, 
but its Wednesday replacement, 
The Fanelli Boys, did not fare well 
against Doogie.
NBC admitted its mistake. 
Quantum Leap and Night Court 
are back in their old slots, and 
Hunter will try to do what they 
could not: find a Friday audience.
AND THE #1 BAD PRO
GRAMMING DECISION IS....

Peaks, ABC. How to Kill Two 
Great Shows in Five Easy Les
sons  1. Find two great shows.
2. Let them attract loyal follow

The other day I was reading my 
latest copy of Vicious Hippies 
From Panda Hell  they had 
everythingyou wanna know about 
hardcore punks in Portland, plus 
a great interview with The 
Mummies  but I gave up before 
I finished the whole issue because 
the days mail came in with a copy 
of Satan On a Stick, a new devilworship magazine out of Maryland that has writers so stoned on 
drugs that none of the stories have 
' endings. I set it down next to The 
Mandocrucians Digest, which, as 
far as I know, is the only publi
cation devoted exclusively to 
mandolin players.
Next to my desk is a three-foothigh pile of newsletters with 
names like Living Love (the pub
lishers are building a city in 
Colorado where the space aliens 
 can land, theyre trying to pre
serve the buffaloes until the space 
aliens get here), Roller Sports 
Report (the Bible of roller derby),
; and Stampede of Worms 
(screamingpoetry from Iowa City, 
Iowa, which, unfortunately, is too 
blurry to read).
Whats happening to me?
I used to read the Grapevine 
Daily News, I used to look up in
formation in the encyclopedia. 
Then, about a year ago, I started 
publishing my We Are the Weird 
newsletter weekly, and other 
publications started flooding in 
(apparently the weird seek out 
the weird), and I started writing 
about some of them in the news
letter, and now Im a man with
- thousands of newsletters, 
fanzines, and more bad poetry 
magazines than any man could 
read in one lifetime. (How about 
Casa de Caca, out of Baltimore? 
Or perhaps youd prefer to read 
Alabama Dogshoe Moustache, the 
Schenectady poetry review in 
which part of the poetic experiJOE BOB GOES TO 
THE DRIVE-IN
by Joe Bob Briggs
ence is trying to unfold the 
magazine!)
I have now discovered a great 
truth about America:
Ajiy idiot can be a desktop 
publisher.
Its great.
I love this.
There havent been this many 
wild and strange ravings out of 
the American press in 200 years. 
A lot of these publications are 
one-man operations, just like 
those of Thomas Paine and Ben
jamin Franklin were, but the dif
ference between now and the un
derground press of the sixties is 
that it is so cheap to publish a 
newsletter on a personal computer 
that you can actually get your 
ravings distributed and read 
without having an actualjob. With 
this many people spreading this 
many dangerous, nutty, fringe 
ideas, theres hope for the First 
Amendment yet.
You can also tell which cities 
are healthy and which are dead 
by watching where the fanzines 
are coming from. For example, 
more weird newsletters per capita 
come from Toronto than anywhere 
else. My favorite is a sick journal 
of twisted humor and disgusting 
film reviews that used to be called 
Killbaby. Suddenly, last month, 
the title was changedto Tame. The 
editor was asked why. Reason: 
his wife has a baby!
As you can see, the fanzine press 
is also more honest than the 
mainstream press.
Seattle is a zine town. So is 
Manchester, England, and 
Sydney, Australia. The zine scene, 
especially the part that deals with 
American movies and music, is 
truly international. I have sub
scribers in Thailand, Guyana, and 
the Fiji Islands. And Im besieged 
with letters from Austria and 
Scandinavia, where many drivein movies are banned as too vio
lent. (Communism lives.)
English is the accepted lan
guage of all international zines, 
which means the only country 
thats isolated is France. The 
French zine writers refuse to 
publish in any language except 
French. This is okay with us, 
though, because the French dont 
have anything to say that we par
ticularly want to hear.
New York is a bad zine town. So 
is El Lay. Bucharest, on the other 
hand, is a great town for sciencefiction magazines. One drawback: 
if you write anything for them, 
they pay you in Romanian cur
rency, which no international 
bank will accept. They know that 
no international bank will accept 
it. Thats why they pay you in 
Romanian money.
Iowa, Baltimore, and Milwau
kee are full of great fanzines. I 
have no idea why.
If you havent experienced this 
world, you should subscribe to 40, 
50 of them and start learning 
about alternative mothering 
from The Compleat Mother out of 
Minot, ND (check out that breast
feeding issue), or, if youre under 
18 and you hate being told you 
cant drink or go to certain mov
ies, then you definitely need Die 
Fat Piggy Die! out of Waynes ville, 
Mo, and, of course, no household 
library is complete without The
Lori Singer and Richard Grant try to answer the question What would happen if a really religious Pjlgrjm 
guy from the 17th century fell in love, like, with this waitress in El Lay, what would that be like, huh?, in 
Warlock.
Sporeprint, published by the fine 
people in Victoria, British Co
lumbia, who believe that psyche
delic mushrooms are religious 
sacraments.
Oh, I almost forgot: The Weasel 
Help Monthly, published in North 
Carolina, is devoted to proving 
that ferrets are safe and friendly 
pets, and fighting against the bans 
on ferret sales that are sweeping 
this country of ours.
Kinda makes you feel proud, 
dont it?
(Since I know some ofyou do not 
believe these publications exist, 
send an SASE to PO Box 2002, 
Dallas, Texas 75221, and Ill send 
you the addresses.)
Speaking of dead rodents, 
Warlock is a great movie that 
came out a couple weeks ago and 
didnt get noticed worth diddly 
squat, but its the first flick that 
ask the question Could a 17thcentury Pilgrim in a fur suit and 
an El Lay waitress in a mini-skirt 
establish a bi-coastal relation
ship? And the answer is, Yes, 
but only if united by the fear of a 
flying warlock with long blond 
hair who looks like a rock singer 
and is trying to destroy the uni
verse.
In other words, we got some 
serious plot going on here, with 
the devil working overtime. First 
Satan saves Julian Stands fife by
making a big thunderstorm in 
Salem, Massachusetts, in 1691, 
where Julian has just received 
his sentence: You are to^be

time and space, Terminator-style,

-What are you going to do with 
all those comics when you get old 
and gray? Every once in a while I 
try to answer that question, and a 
pleasant thought crosses my 
mind. Wouldnt it be great to tell 
yotir children an exciting, fresh 
new story for every night of their 
childhood?
Read me a bedtime story, 
Daddy, the little angel would say 
with a hungry, pure mind. And 
you could go downstairs to your 
collection and thumb through the 
thirty-two page, four color pieces 
of your life. But what would you 
pick? Something really good, I 
suppose, something like The 
. Sandman.
I took a mythology course a few 
' months ago, and one thought that 
kept running through my mind 
was, Is mythology dead? No, its 
not dead, in the sense that all the 
old stories are reprinted and re
told again and again with the 
 same zeal that they must have 
.. commanded centuries ago. One of 
the most important achievements 
ofmythology was to present to 
the world of literature a cast of 
unique and different archetypes 
that have withstood the test of 
time.
,But do we have the ability in 
this day and age to create new 
i. archetypes that will stay with the 
world culture for hundreds of 
-syears to come? Have all the good 
ideas been used up, and will we be 
recycling the stories of Oedipus 
and Odysseus for the next mil. lennia? Of course not! Comicbooks

and many other forms of enter
tainment have created mytho
logical analogs over the years.
Although todays heroes are 
unique and powerful, as were the 
archetypes of the ancient world, 
they are firmly entrenched in our 
cultures reality. These characters 
are either tributes to people in 
that culture, or the dark reflec
tions of them. However, few have 
the alluring aura of grandeur, of 
mythology in the truest sense, 
that writer Neil Gaimans singu
lar, magnificent creation, The 
Sandman does.
By giving life to the mysteries 
of the mind and heart, mythology 
has always sought to explain the 
unknown in creative ways. Just 
think back on any of your favorite 
Greek deities and youll know 
what I mean. In Gaimans fairy 
tale there exist beings known as 
the Endless, the personifications, 
the Olympians, of modern my
thology. Among them is the 
Sandman, the god of dreams, who 
is the crux of the book.
Who is this deity? He is a tall, 
pale, match-like-bony creature. At 
his side is a pouch containing the
By giving life to the mysteries of the 
mind and heart, mythology has al
ways sought to explain the unknown 
in creative ways.
fine grains of dreams. His mantle 
is an insectlike helmet made of 
bone and glass. And if you looked 
in his eyes, you would see nothing 
but a black void ... this is the 
Sandman. Under a mane of long 
black hair lies the mind of an 
arrogant, shrewd, powerful god 
who has made many mistakes in 
his immortal life. It is amazing to 
see that after eons, the lord of 
dreams is still growing up.
The years have made Dream, 
as he is commonly referred to, a 
humbler god, for he was impris
oned by a human being for almost 
a century. This bout with humil
ity gave this intriguing character 
a new perspective on his infinite 
and convoluted fife. He began to 
appreciate the power he holds and 
the crucial role he plays as one of 
the tailors of reality. Along with 
this sense of humility came a 
newfound sense of honor and de
sire to right the many wrongs he 
has committed in his existence.
The books are an intriguing mix 
of perspective. Several stories deal 
with the development of the 
Sandman as a character. These 
are personal stories that make 
this all-powerful deity seem 
amazingly human and vulner
able. Its quite refreshing, and 
something you dont often find in 
characters who command such 
power and respect over their fic
tional worlds.
Then there are the stories, 
which have a poetic, fairy tale 
quality to them. In these deeply 
satisfying stories, the Sandman 
truly takes on the mythic role 
that gives the book its timeless 
quality. He pops in and out of 
peoples lives, affecting them ir
revocably, while he himself re
mains distant and aloof.
In addition to wonderful char
acters, The Sandman explores 
questions which have intrigued 
humans for decades. Ever won
der what cats dream of when 
theyre asleep? Can you imagine 
having one of the goddesses of 
storytelling under your control? 
What kind of place is Hell anyway? 
Who is the Devil? What kind of 
person is Death? Whats the real 
story behind William Shake
speares A Midsummer Nights 
Dream? Are we just dolls in a 
cosmic doll house?
You can find the answer to all of 
these questions, and so much 
more, in the pages of the modem 
fairy tale called The Sandman.

Cats pounce through Pittsburgh
By TERRI KASCH
! Tartan Asst. Diversions Editor
If you were writing a musical 
and you could hire anyone in his
tory as your lyricist, whom would 
^ypu choose? Shakespeare? Emily 
^Dickinson? John Lennon, maybe? 
Andrew Lloyd Webber chose T. S. 
Eliot for his smash hit Cats, which 
is currently sneaking up on its 
tenth year on Broadway.
The words for each number in 
; the show are taken almost en; tirely from Eliots Old Possums 
\ Book of Practical Cats. Here and 
; there, Webber warns that he and 
! his colleagues had to make a few 
! alterations to the poems for vari
ous reasons, but overall the songs 
are true to Eliots work.
Cats has very little to offer in 
; the way of plot. The premise goes 
; that each year all the Jellicle cats 
I gather to see which one will be 
chosen by Deuteronomy for re
birth. So, the entire play becomes 
merely an introduction to all of 
the candidates.

When a play comes up short in 
one area, it must compensate in 
some way. Cats compensates in 
every conceivable way. For start
ers, the music is fantastic. Most 
great poets achieve a rhythm in 
their work closely akin to music. 
What Webber seems to have done 
is simply to release the inborn 
music in Eliots work. That is not 
to say that Webber didnt seize a 
few opportunities to show off. 
Take the opening number, for 
example. Lines like Jellicle songs 
for Jellicle cats are repeated so 
many times that the words quickly 
take a back seat to the melody.
The set and costumes alone are 
worth the trip to the box office.
The Broadway set for Cats was 
estimated to have cost six million 
dollars. The play is set in a 
junkyard which is meticulously 
scaled so that the audience sees 
each item from the perspective of 
a cat. The set also holds a few 
surprises to be unveiled through
out the show.
The costumes are flashy and 
fun, and when accompanied with 
the realistic face make-up, the 
effect is larger than life. These 
are the factors that the audience 
can rely on to make the show fun 
in the absence of an engrossing 
story. However, the show still re
quires the strongest talents 
available. Aside from the de
manding choreography, Cats is 
traditionally a very close show. 
The actors dance through the 
aisles and journey into the seats, 
pawing and purring at audience 
members.
So treat your girlfriend or boy
friend, a close friend, or even 
yourself to Webbers seemingly 
immortal musical Cats.

Queen of Hearts
Theres nothing like dangerous love. It makes the 
heart pound faster and it sure makes a movie plot far 
more interesting.
Rosa and Danilo are lovers who flee to London to 
escape conflict. It seems that one of Rosas admirers 
is getting a bit persistent. There is no other alterna
tive to escape his grasp. Its a bit odd that the lovers 
have to leave their home to do this, though. Anyway, 
twenty years later, the suitor that Rosa has left is a 
rich nightclub owner. Despite his affluent lifestyle, 
he still longs for his former love. He tracks her down 
and will do anything to win her back.
Following a basic soap opera theme, the movie 
shows the effects love can have on various people 
and the lengths to which they will go to get what they 
f want.

j Weller is accompanied by a cast of remarkable 
talent for a sci-fi cult film. Ellen Barkin (Sea of Love), 
Jeff Goldblum (The Fly), John Lithgow (Memphis 
Belle), and Christopher Lloyd (Back to the Future) fill 
in as mysterious strangers, geeky surgeons, pos
sessed scientists, and homicidal aliens named John.
Buckaroo Banzai is not an easy movie to follow. 
Despite that, its great fun  the midnight show 
should be especially enjoyable.

Risky Business
Ah, to be young again. Remember the excitement 
of having your parents leave you at home for the 
weekend with the trust that you wouldnt wreck the 
place? Well, take a trip down memory lane with this 
teen classic.
Tom sex god Cruise plays the fortunate, wellrespected kid whos left with mucho dinero, the keys 
to dads Porsche, and that manly desire to score 
while the opportunity is ripe. His lust causes him to 
meet a woman of the evening, Rebecca De Mornay, 
where the fun begins as Sir Cruise gets entangled in 
trouble with his new acquaintance.
Remember the joy of watching Tom Cruise danc
ing around in his underwear, the young couple 
getting cozy in various locations, and that Porsche 
rolling into the water. Give up a buck for this trip 
into the past.

Star Trek III: The 
Search for Spock
Remember the Genesis Device from Star Trek III 
The one that plastered a carpet of flora all over the 
dead planet where Mr. Spocks cadaver was laid to 
rest? Well, apparently it had some bugs, and the 
planet is going up in volcanic smoke.
Dr. McCoys descent into near-psychosis tips off 
Captain Kirk that Spock has been resurrected, so he 
and his aging entourage hijack the Enterprise in 
order to go find the Vulcan in time for Star Trek IV.
This is one of the better specimens of the Star Trek 
films, and is rather reminiscent of the old TV series. 
The movie is chock full of fast-paced space combat 
and Vulcan anthropology. If nothing else, its worth 
seeing for Kirks classic line: I... have had... enough 
... of you!

All in all, the movie might prove 
satisfactory to the average cavedweller. But when one hears that 
Allen is paired up with Midler, 
one expects more than just funny 
and good. One expects brilliance, 
genius, hilarity, andhysteria. The 
only thing hysterical about this 
rnovie was that it wasnt. And 
what more could Mazursky ask 
for? All he had was Woody, Bette,
huge mall, and two hundred 
extras walking around. His at
tempt to taper off the comedy as 
themovie progressed and replace 
itwith somethingmore clever and 
perhaps more sensitive is all very 
plausible; if only he had done 
somethingmore plausible with it.
As for Woody and Bette, I hope 
that this is not the last that well

King of Hearts
Sometimes a serious topic can be turned into a 
refreshing idea for a movie. War, of course, is not a 
subject which should be a constant form of entertain
ment, but it is sometimes interesting to see the 
depictions of human behavior during war time on 
screen.
Scott Bates plays a World War I Scottish infantry
man whos on the hunt for a concealed enemy bun
ker. During his search, he comes across a small town 
which has been deserted by the citizens. Oddly 
enough, there are still some people about. Who are 
they? Well, they are inmates from a nearby insane 
asylum. In portraying the citizens of the town, the 
inmates bring across the point of how senseless war 
is.
Perhaps in this day and age it would be worth 
viewing such a film to develop a different under
standing about our own current events.

Ghost
Demi Moore and Patrick Swayze are a couple 
deeply in love. When Swayze is killed during a 
robbery, his soul doesnt go directly to the heavens. 
Instead, his spirit stays on earth to watch his poor 
girlfriends heart being tormented by his untimely 
death. During his afterlife on earth, Swayze discovers 
that his death was a set up and vows to teach the evil 
forces who murdered him a lesson.
The movie truly does teach us all a lesson about 
love and dedication. While doing this it also gives us 
a great soundtrack with the Righteous Brothers 
Unchained Melody, which accompanies the great 
clay scene in the film. Although the movie has a sad 
tone, spending the dollar on a movie of this quality 
will lift your spirits.

Three Men and a Little Lady
Fluff reigns in this cotton-candy sequel to 1987s 
Three Men and a Baby, as Tom Selleck, Steve 
Guttenberg, and Ted Danson are fathering an older 
and more inquisitive Mary. Now, instead of chang
ing diapers, theyre explaining sex and why they 
have female guests in the middle of the night.
Marys mom Sylvia (Nancy Travis) is living with 
the trio of dads and her daughter until an English 
play director sweeps her off her feet and right off to 
London, along with Mary. The guys wallow briefly in 
their regained bachelorhood, but decide that the fast 
lane is part of their past. Convinced that Mr. Play 
Director is not Mr. Right for neither Sylvia nor Mary, 
the dads take their silly antics overseas. Peter 
(Selleck) has an ulterior motive in mind, which 
ultimately concludes in one of those ohmygod-itwas-so-obvious-I-cant-believe-they-actually-did-it 
endings. This movies not deep, but its cute.

Star Trek IV: The 
Voyage Home
Wrapping up the intergalactic epic begun with 
Star Trek II, Star Trek TV finds Kirk and his posse 
hiphopping back to 20th-century Earth in search of 
a whale and a few cheap laughs. At times more 
comedy than sci-fi, Star Trek TV features the typical 
indestructible-race-of-spacefaring-animals-seeks-todiscover-what-happened-to-their-long-extinctEarth-counterparts-and-inadvertently-lays-wasteto-all-of-civilization storyline.
Its clearly a family-oriented movie, since theres 
not much tension in the plot, or realism, even for Star 
Trek. Furthermore, the music sounds like a watereddown Christmas carol. However, the story is oddly 
enjoyable, and the Trekkie dialogue has never been 
more urbane and entertaining. Spend the buck and 
savor the experience, because its all downhill from 
here.
