Senate proposes 
new overload 
policy changes
By LAURA PALANKER
Tartan Junior Staff writer
A proposal challenging the 
overload policy has been 
formed by the Academic Af
fairs Committee of Senate. 
The proposal is in response 
to the amendment in the Stu
dent Handbook of Carnegie 
Mellon University, which fa
vors upperclassmen. The 
course overload policy, as it
appears in ----------------------------
the Handbook, 
states that 
Fresh
men and 
first semester 
transfer 
students 
are limited 
toanormal 
schedule of 
units in
their first semester of atten
dance. Academic Affairs 
proposes that this rule is un
fair to entering students, par
ticularly those who take part 
in an extracurricular activ
ity, (usually in the arts) that 
gives creditforparticipation. 
The upperclassman policy in 
the Handbook states that an 
upperclassman may obtain 
approval for a unit overload
from an academic advisor or 
department head provided 
the gradepoint average for 
the preceding semesters is 
3.00 or better.
Mike Tomblyn, Academic 
Affairs Chair, points out sev

should be changed in the re

National Coming 
Out Day observed
By MIKE KUNSMANN
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
National Coming Out Day 
(NCOD) is an annual openness 
and awareness day about gays, 
lesbians, and bisexuals. People 
who are gay or supportive of 
homosexuality were given rainbow-colored ribbons to wear to 
show support. Highlights of the 
day included speeches, a short 
play, and an information deskin 
front of Doherty Hall.
The first to speak was Dean of 
Student Affairs Michael 
Murphy. He explained that on 
campus this day is not only for 
gays and bisexuals, but for ev
eryone to see the wide areas of 
support and openness towards 
this issue on the Carnegie Mel
lon campus. He talked about 
Carnegie Mellon Universitys 
harassment policy that ensures 
and protects the rights of the 
gay and bisexual community at
CM Dining Service faces deficit
By ALIM RAY
Tartan Contributing Editor
Carnegie Mellon Dining Ser
vice (CMDS) wishes to make 
changes in its programs as soon 
as possible because it is facing a 
deficit at the end of CMlTs fiscal 
year.
Carnegie Mellon Dining Ser
vice will not make a decision on 
what changes will be made or 
when, until surveys published 
in The Tartan this week seeking 
students opinions on possible 
changes have been returned. 
We havent decided [what 
changes should be made]. We 
really want to hear what stu
dents have to say.... What we 
are considering is what, if any, 
changes should be made this

has not yet been made. But we 
will be making that decision as

year to the plan, said Jim 
Gurley, director of Carnegie 
Mellon Dining Service.
CMDS is not sure if there will 
be any changes this year. The 
decision to balance the budget 
either this year or distribute the
soon as possible, said Roger 
Heydt, associatedirector of 
CMDS.
Dining Service conducted its 
own review in September before 
the University-wide forecast in 
October, in order to ensure
enough time to institute changes 
if necessary. The early Septem
ber report, along with trends 
found in CMDS weekly reports, 
show many factors which will 
cause a deficit. One is the de
crease in students on the meal 
plan from last year. Gurley and 
Heydt predicted a drop in stu
dents on the plan, but there were 
200 students who didnt stay on 
the plan.
Despite this loss, the use of 
the Kiltie Court has risen while 
other campus facilities have not 
been utilized as much. The lower 
customer counts at other cam
pus facilities coupled with the

CMU.
We need enforcement, said 
Murphy, since although our cam
pus is liberal on this issue there 
still is some harassment. He said 
that the best way to come to a 
mutual understanding is to in
crease the levels of awareness 
and education. On campus there 
are many opportunities for 
people to learn about homosexu
ality. Numerous films and lec
tures intended for the gay and 
the straight are sponsored by 
cmuOUT. Murphy said, Ive 
been very pleased by the sup
port of the campus.
The next speaker was Chris 
Newman, a fifth year electrical 
and chemical engineering stu
dent, who has known he was gay 
since he was 13. He explained 
how the media put him down 
and his religion told him he was 
a sinner. This forced him to go 
into hiding and keep his deep

Senate cuts 
buggy funding
By MATT BUSHEY
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
The Student Senate has cut 
fundingto some campus organi
zations by cutting buggy fund
ing and refusing to pay for sto
len items. These policies were 
added to the revised Senate fis
cal policy.
According to the buggy policy, 
the Senate will pay for 25 per
cent of an organizations buggy 
maintenance budget each year 
and 66 percent of the cost of 
buggy every three years.
Were going to see how it 
works, said Senate Chair Chris 
Neighbor. Previously, Senate 
has covered most of the buggy 
expenses for FRINGE, CIA, Pio
neers, and Spirit. Neighbor ex
pects that the policy might be 
changed. I can foresee us ques
tioning what is considered main
tenance, said Neighbor.
The reason for the cut in fund
ing stems'from some very strong 
opposition from the Greek orga
nizations on campus. The fra
ternities and sororities are not 
funded by Student Senate be
cause of the Senates policy of 
notfundingorganizations which
discriminate. According to 
Neighbor, the Greek organiza
tions discriminate based on sex. 
Yes, any individual can go to a 
fraternity, said Neighbor, but 
[the fraternities] do have the 
choice of who joins.
The cut in buggy funding to 
other organizations was in reac
tion to the complaints from the 
Greek community. The cost of 
building and maintaining a 
buggy varies from three to seven 
thousand dollars, which was 
being paid to some non-Greek 
organizations.
The organizations on campus 
are beginning to feel the effects 
of the policy change. I dont like 
the change in policy ... said 
FRINGE Chair Julie Reker, a 
senior architecture major, but I 
see where this has to happen. 
According to Reker, the in
creased costs will eventually 
become the burden of the mem
bers.
Student Senate has also said 
that organizations mustproduce 
and run their buggy for one year 
on their own before they receive 
any money. The whole reason 
was because we were receiving

Senates approve International Festival resolution
By LESLIE ZUBATY
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
A resolution that instructors 
lighten students workloads dur
ing International Festival was 
proposed by the Academic Af
fairs Committee of Student Sen
ate. They presented the proposal 
to Faculty Senate and Student 
Senate for approval.
Academic Affairs Committee 
Chair Mike Tomblyn reports
that the Faculty Seriate passed 
the proposal by a unanimous 
vote. We were really surprised 
that they went along with it so 
quickly and easily. Rarely do 
unanimous votes occur. Student 
Senate also unanimously ap
proved the proposal.
The topic for this first year of 
International Festival is Asia. 
Speakers from various embas
sies will be participatingin pre
sentations. The festivities will
also offer a diverse array of eth
nic foods, dance, music, and 
clothing. Organizers feel Inter
national Festival will be a great 
opportunity each year to in
crease students understanding 
of foreign cultures.
Tomblyn, along with other 
members of the Academic Af
fairs Committee, feels the pub
lic relations and advertising for 
International Festival was a 
living nightmare, and believes
students should be made more 
aware of the festival activities 
as well as be more encouraged to 
participate.
Members of the Faculty Sen
ate and Student Senate hope 
the resolution, allowing Carn
egie Mellon students to feel less 
pressure from academic work 
during International Festival, 
will prompt more interest and 
participation in the upcoming 
festival events.

Gym advisory committee formed
By CHRIS MAPLES
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
A committee was finalized 
which will provide information, 
service, and suggestions for im
provements for the gym, after a 
meeting between Student 
Senates Campus Affairs Com
mittee and John Harvey, CMUs 
director of Athletics and Physi
cal Education.
Its a 67-year-old building, 
says Harvey, Add in its limited 
space, cramped traffic flow, and 
a tight budget, andyou get prob
lems that are difficult to work 
with. The facility is central for 
physical education classes, inter-collegiate basketball and the 
Athletic Department offices. Its
our biggest job to maintain and 
maximize the space we have. 
Already, gym staff dedicates 
most of its weekly effort and 
operational budget to perform
ing basic maintenance. Many 
regular users complain, how
ever, that while itisunderstandable that athletics resources 
sometimesfalter, problems with 
scheduling of facilities or over
all appearance are independent 
of budget constraints.
In February, the Campus Af
fairs Committee posted a notice 
on electric bulletin boards ask
ing for input on the condition of 
the gym. The responses 
prompted the publication of a 
report on the gym facility, which 
was submitted to Harvey and
President Robert Mehrabian, 
among others. The report listed 
the pool schedule and mainte
nance, sanitary conditions, and 
the rapidly deteriorating condi
tion of the weight room among 
difficulties most consistently 
cited. The consistently appall
ing conditions in the locker 
rooms were also listed.
Offeringpossible solutions and 
rankings of main priority, the 
report intended to call for re
form as quickly as possible. Over 
five months later, the com
mittee's concern and the Ath
letic Departments responsibil
ity to respond culminated in 
the first meeting of the newly 
formed gym committee.

THIS JUST IN.,,
Senate confirms Thomas to Court
WASHINGTON, Oct. 15, (DJ)The 
Senate narrowly voted to confirm 
. Clarence Thomas as an associate jus
tice on the Supreme Court. The 52-48 
vote  one of the closest in the history 
of the court  ended the most politi
cally charged debate on Capitol Hill 
since Congress approved resolutions 
last winter clearing the way for U.S. 
military force against Iraq.
The conservative Thomas, a former 
director of the Equal Employment Op
portunity Commission, will take the 
seat held by Thurgood Marshall, long 
the courts most ardent civil rights ad
vocate.
The debate on Thomas largely cen
tered on allegations of sexual harass
ment made by a former aide, Anita Hill, 
overshadowing the nominees contro
versial opposition to government Affir
mative Action programs and his denial 
of any opinion on abortion.
President Bush said he was pleased 
that the Senate voted to confirm Judge
Clarence Thomas for the Supreme 
Court.
Judge Thomas has demonstrated to 
the Congress and to the Nation that he 
is a man of honesty, dedication, and 
commitment to the Constitution and 
the rule of law, Bush said in a state
ment following the confirmation vote.
The nation and the court benefit 
from having a man of principle who is 
sensitive to the problems and opportu
nities facing all Americans, he said.
Bush also thanked Sen. John 
Danforth for his help in getting the 
Thomas nomination through the Sen
ate.
After a hard-fought victory, however, 
an unsettling question remains: How 
will the excruciating ordeal of the past 
two weeks influence Judge Thomas 
legal views and decisions as an associ
ate justice on the Supreme Court?
Even if he hadnt gone through the 
agony of the past two weeks, Thomas 
would have been a crucial addition to
the court, which is closely divided on 
such extraordinarily important issues 
as abortion, religious expression, and 
free speech.
But Thomas friends and foes agree 
that his nationally televised trial by 
fire cannot fail to change him as a 
jurist. In his own testimony, he said an 
assassins bullet would have been pref
erable to the public hearings over alle
gations of sexual harassment. More
over, at 43, he is a relatively young 
man, and his confirmation hearings 
suggested that his views on many cen
tral legal questions are in flux. This 
recent traumatic experience is sure to 
affect his thinking.
Clint Bolick, vice president of the 
Institute for Justice in Washington and 
a close friend of Thomas, says that the 
weekend hearings will deepen his sym
pathy for victims and will reconfirm 
his very strong belief in individual 
rights.
But those who had qualms about
Thomas before Anita Hills accusations 
against him exploded in public worry 
that the hearings will push him in a 
different direction. He now sees him
self as the victim of some kind of leftwing conspiracy, says Estelle Rogers, 
a Washington attorney. As a result, she 
argues, Thomas will be more likely to 
rule against the interests of civil rights 
organizations and womens groups that 
opposed him.
Others are concerned that the Su
preme Court as an institution will be 
diminished for having Thomas on the 
bench, even though Hills allegations of 
misconduct were not proven. Conser
vative legal commentator Bruce Fein, 
who had been a Thomas supporter, 
says the Senate should have rejected 
the nominee because the Supreme 
Court has got to be an institution thats 
above suspicion.
Legal experts all along the political 
spectrum believe the rocky confirma
tion hearings will influence the judges
views on a host of issues soon to be 
before the court. The charges by Hill 
could hardly fail to influence his think, 
ing on a sexual harassment case that 
will be argued this fall. His lingering 
anger toward womens groups could 
also affect his thoughts on abortion  
the most controversial issue before the 
court, and an issue on which Thomas 
has said he has no current view.
His confrontation with Congress could 
easily enough affect his view of cases 
involving the separation of powers be
tween the three branches of govern
ment. The high-tech lynching, as he 
called it, could also make him less sympathetic to a free press in First Amend
ment cases.
On the other hand, liberals hope that 
his experience at the hands of the Sen
ate will have sensitized Thomas to the 
rights of people charged with wrongdo
ing. His contention that he was wrongly 
accused could make him empathize with 
those who protest their innocence.
Gunman murders 23
KILLEEN, Texas, Oct. 17, (AP)  
Diners screamed in terror and cowered 
behind counters as a man with a highpowered pistol methodically moved 
through a crowded cafeteria and killed 
22 peoplein the nations deadliest shoot
ing rampage.
The assault began just before 1 pm 
Wednesday when George Hennard, 35, 
of Belton, drove his pickup through a 
plate-glass window of a Lubys Cafete
ria, climbed out and opened fire. The 
restaurant was jammed with 100 or 
more lunchtime patrons, including sev
eral attending Boss Day celebrations.
Ten minutes after it began, the ram
page ended when Hennard, wounded 
by police gunfire, killed himself with a 
bullet in the head as he lay outside a 
restroom, authorities said. That 
brought the death toll to 23.
Sgt. Bill Cooper of the state Depart
ment of Public Safety said he saw 
Hennard approach an elderly woman
as she shielded her wounded husband. 
The woman looked him in the eye, then 
bowed her head, and Hennard shot her, 
Cooper said.
Police said they had no motive for the 
rampage and knew of no connection 
between the gunmans statements and 
the shooting, but neighbors described 
him as frightening. Jane Bugg said he 
had harassed her and her two adult 
daughters for months, running in front 
of her car, phoning, and sending her 
daughters a bizarre letter.
We just lived in fear of the man, 
said the 46-year-old medical secre
tary.
Mrs. Bugg said Hennards letter to 
her daughters in June read in part: 
Please give me the satisfaction of some
day laughing in the face of all those 
mostly white, treacherous female vi
pers from two towns who tried to de
stroy me and my family. She said she 
turned the letter over to police.
Harassment cases reexamined
WASHINGTON, Oct. 18, (DJ)  The male back
lash begins.
Lawyers expect the confirmation of Clarence Tho
mas to add even more fire to an emerging trend: the 
small but growing number of men who have sued 
their employers in recent years, contending they 
were wrongfully accused of sexual harassment and 
even punished for it.
The lawsuits usually allege that management 
unjustly fired them or that a flawed in-house inves
tigation tarnished their reputations. One supervi
sor even asserted that airing false accusations 
turned him into the harassment victim. Sexual ha
rassment charges have become a great tool to get 
rid of somebody, argues an axed senior executive 
who is challenging his dismissal for that reason. A 
suit is the only defense you have.
The legal battles are full of risk and trauma for all 
concerned. The cases often stretch on for years and 
run up huge tabs for both sides. Few men win.
But others keep filing suits. Among the dozen 
major companies hit so far: General Motors Corp., 
American Telephone & Telegraph Co., Du Pont Co.,
Boeing Co., and Rockwell International Corp.
In fighting these retaliatory suits, corporations 
believe they must pull out all stops in order to protect 
their anti-harassment efforts. Otherwise, an alleged 
harassers charges will have a chilling effect on people 
coming forward with sexual harassment allegations, 
says Douglas Bain, Boeings assistant general counsel. 
The diversified aerospace company has won three suits 
brought by accused sex harassers as well as a number of 
discrimination complaints filed with state and federal 
bias agencies over the past decade.
Polaroid Corp. says it spent more than $100,000 to 
defeat two defamation suits brought by male employees 
accused of sexual harassment. One case dragged on for 11 
years. The company hasnt been hit with any similar suits 
since that case ended in 1987. We dug in our heels and 
said, 'Whatever it takes, recalls AnnLeibowitz, Polaroids 
labor counsel.
With Judge Thomas confirmed for a Supreme Court 
seat, people will be more willing to stand up and defend 
themselves against harassment claims, predicts Mark 
Dichter of the Philadelphia law firm Morgan, Lewis & 
Bockius.
Bush orders talks on Star Wars restrictions
WASHINGTON, Oct. 15, (DJ)  
President Bush has authorized U.S. 
negotiators to begin talks in Geneva to 
facilitate deployment of a limited spacebased ballistic missile defense system, 
White House Spokesman Marlin 
Fitzwater said.
The announcement marks the first 
timethattheU.S. and the Soviet Union
have both been willing to discuss limi
tations and deployment timing of a 
system that would protect the U.S. 
against accidental, unauthorized, or 
third country launches. It is also a by
product of recent moves by Bush and 
Gorbachev to cut the number of tactical 
nuclear weapons and generally work to 
lower the threat of nuclear weapons.
Fitzwater said that the U.S. is now 
prepared to discuss limits on the scope 
and timing of defense deployments, 
consistent with the presidents direc
tion to pursue a system providing Glo
bal Protection Against Limited Strikes. 
Fitzwater said that the talks should 
make it possible to reach an agree
ment facilitating the deployment of
ballistic missile defenses to protect 
against accidental, unauthorized, or 
third country launches.
Until now, the U.S. had been unwill
ing to subject its Star Wars defense 
initiative to this kind of limitation 
talks, while the Soviets have charged 
that any anti-missile system would 
violate the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty,

feelings a secret.
He said that when his sis
ter died of cancer h e could not 
show his emotion any longer. 
He spoke about his own per
sonal coming out story . I 
had hidden my feelings so 
well I found it hard to cry, 
said Newman. It was then 
that he decided to face his 
troubles head on. He said, I 
will be out. I will be openly 
gay... and anyone who is dif
ferent should be who they are 
without fear.
The following speaker was 
Jane Hardy, who is a library 
assistant and an open les
bian.
I came out in 1975 and 
still my relationship is not 
taken seriously. How do you 
argue with die fag?  said 
Hardy. She went on to say 
that gays and lesbians are 
forced to lie all the time be
cause of prejudices.
We are assumed to be straight 
and [this assumption] of hetero
sexuality is our only safety [from 
discrimination], said Hardy.
She then offered her own sup
port to those who arehomosexual 
yet are too terrified to come out. 
She said that laws, religions, 
the fear of losing friends and 
family support are some of the 
reasons for this tremendous op
pression of emotions.
She also said that there are 
more homosexuals than people 
realize, and a lot of the hardship 
of coming out couldbe prevented 
if their fears could be reduced.
She said some ways the cam
pus can help reduce fears are to 
resist calling people derogatory 
names for their sexual prefer
ences and to leave cmuOUTposters hanging. She encouraged 
everyone to show their support 
so that people who are homo
sexual can more easily confront
the terror of realization.
National Coming Out Day 
was created to help people 
who are scared, or feel op
pressed, and to help make 
coming out less of a torture.
Anybody, gay or straight, 
is welcome to join cmuOUT. 
It supports the homosexual 
community on Carnegie Mel
lon University's campus and 
promotes awareness to the 
community as a whole.
Christopher Wood, a jun
ior psychology major, said he 
came out last semester.
I have more friends now 
that Im out.... I got only one 
negative reaction, said 
Wood. He said the hardest 
part about coming out is that 
some of the people he knows 
who have not come out ignore 
him and also their own feel
ings.
Coming out is how you 
identify yourself, said Wood.
POLICY, from page 1
so many organizations for fundingthat we wanted to be sure we 
werent throwing money, away 
for organizations that werent 
goingto be aroundfor very long, 
said Neighbor.
Another major change to the 
Senate policy is the addition of a 
liability clause which protects 
Student Senate from being re
sponsible for stolen items. Ac
cording Student Senates Fund
ing and Recognition Committee 
Chair Terrel Dean, the theft 
must be on file and in a police 
report for Senate to consider re
imbursing an organization. In 
general, we wouldnt be willing 
to reimburse an organization for 
borrowed equipment, said 
Dean.
Two cases have recently come 
before Student Senate for con
sideration. In thefive years that 
Neighbor has been on Student 
Senate, this is the first time he 
hasheardof such incidents. We 
have experienced over the past 
year quite a few thefts, he said.
An answering machine that 
belonged to a member of the 
Womens Center was stolen. Al
though Senate has not made a 
final decision if they will reim
burse the Womens Center, 
Neighbor said that because the 
answering machine belonged to 
a member of the organization 
and not the organization itself, 
the chances thatSenate will pay 
for it are small.
The liability clause will pro
tect Student Senate from hav
ing to pay for stolen items nine 
times out of ten. If an indi
vidual can make a strong ap
peal, they do have the capabili
ties to persuade us to override 
it, said Neighbor.
Fringe has been making that 
appeal ever since it had some 
tools stolen during Spring Car
nival last spring. Its not some
thing we feel we can pay for out 
of our pocket, said Reker.
Hundreds of dollars worth of 
power tools used in their booth 
construction were stolen from 
the midway, butReker feels they
are not responsible. According 
to Reker, Fringe was assured 
that the midway was safe from 
the possibility of theft. Every 
organization has to provide 
people to do midway, said 
Reker, referring to the people 
who patrol the area to safeguard 
against theft. Because of this 
protection which was promised 
to them, Reker feels their situa
tion is different and that they 
should be reimbursed for the 
stolen tools.
The demands on the Student 
Senate for funding have been 
increasing, which partially ac
counts for the sudden cuts in 
funds being given out. Last 
spring, eight new organizations 
wererecognizedby StudentSenate, and seven have been recog
nized so far this year. Two of 
these, the Chinese Student As
sociation and the Debate team, 
are newly-funded organizations. 
The organizations affected do 
not have much choice in the 
matter. Were just going tohave 
to deal with it, said Reker.

The Graduate Student Orga
nization (GSO) has proposed the 
creation of a graduate student 
coffeehouse. The GSO is cur
rently waiting for approval of 
this proposal and the naming of 
its location. History doctoral stu
dent and GSO President JenniferTrostsaid, The idea ofthe 
coffeehouse is that it is a solu
tion to some of the inadequacies 
of graduate student life. It would 
give us a place to call our own. 
The coffeehouse would also give 
graduate students status on 
campus while fostering a sense 
of community.
The coffeehouse would serve 
many purposes. Not only would 
it be a place for graduate stu
dents to congregate, but it could 
also accomodate interdepart
mental events. Because a large 
majority of graduate students 
only deal with people from their
departments, the coffeehouse 
would promote unity within the 
entire graduate community. The 
coffeehouse would also allow 
more effective communication 
between GSO and graduate stu
dent relations in addressing 
graduate student concerns.
Location sites for the coffee
house are still under consider
ation. Proposed places include 
the Tartan Loft, the Tartan 
Lounge, or converting the 
present Faculty Lounge. The 
GSO hopes to obtain space in 
thenewUniversity Center build
ing as well.
The coffeehouselocation qualificationsall evolvefromtheneed 
for it to be comfortable, attrac
tive, and easily accessible to 
graduate students. The lounge 
needs to be both a place for 
graduate students to relax and 
socialize while maintaining a 
level of aca
demic en
hancement. 
The lounge 
would be open 
for graduate 
students and 
guests.
There is a 
need for grad
uate students 
to have a place to associate with 
students in other areas of study, 
break the present boundaries of 
interdepartmental protocol, and 
study on campus without hav
ing to make prior arrangements. 
Trost said, The coffeehouse goes 
to the heart of a lot of grad stu
dent concerns.
Grad student

research.
Carnegie Mellon is one of ap
proximately 50 universities that

GSO donates 
volleyball equip
ment to gym
The Graduate Student Orga
nization (GSO) has voted to buy 
new volleyball equipment for the 
gym. The equipment will be used 
by the Faculty and Graduate 
Student Intramural Volleyball 
League, which is open to fac
ulty, staff, and graduate and un
dergraduate students.
The lack of adequate nets was 
noted in Student Senates gym 
report, which was compiled by 
the Campus Affairs Committee. 
The GSO is prepared to devote 
approximately $250 toward the
purchase. It may be possible for 
other groups to borrow the new 
nets, but they are not a replace
ment for the ones used by regu
lar Intramural teams.
The GSO has also donated 
money to the gym to buy an
other water fountain.
Student awarded 
two-year Merck 
fellowship
Lisa Koscielny, a junior infor
mation systems major, has been

(Jennifer Trost): We had our regular 
meeting on Wednesday and finished 
the Graduate Student Coffeehouse 
Resolution:
Whereas the Graduate Students of 
Carnegie Mellon University feel very 
strongly a need for an interdepartmen
tal gathering place, 
and whereas such a facility would 
dramatically improve the quality of life 
for graduate students and make the 
University more attractive to prospec
tive students, 
and whereas no such establishment 
currently exists on the Carnegie Mel
lon University campus, 
and whereas a Graduate Student 
Coffeehouse would meet that need,
the Graduate Student Organization 
(GSO) endorses the Graduate Student 
Coffeehouse proposal of October 9,1991. 
Furthermore, GSO calls upon the Of
fice of Student Affairs to take immedi
ate action to establish on campus a 
Graduate Student Coffeehouse.
Faculty Senate (Dean Murphy): 
First meeting was on Thursday. Dis
cussed two issues: the Undergraduate 
Education Commission and the Sexual 
Assault Policy. Dr. Steinberg discussed 
commission and task forces already on 
their way within the Undergraduate 
Education Commission, and the Sexual 
Assault Policy was considered, and 
council unanimously supported the 
policy, as it will be distributed tonight.
Student Affairs (Tim Foster): An
other reminder International Festival 
is next week, also just wanted to point 
out that one of your peers, Moneet 
Singh, is going to be having a session 
during the festival. The Alcohol Aware
ness week is going on right now, there 
are lots of interesting programs going 
on around campus. Finally the Sexual 
Assault Policy has come out; please 
read it over and we will look for Senate 
endorsement on it next week.
Officer Reports:
President (Hyun Shin): Memos are 
going to be sent out to the campus 
leaders strongly encouraging their par
ticipation in the upcoming International 
Festival and also urging them to tell 
others about the program. Gathering 
Store will be tomorrow night from 4:30- 
6 in MM 103; the session will focus on 
value-added technology; I encourage 
you to go and spread the word. Also Dr. 
Mehrabians address sponsored by the 
Faculty Organization will be on Mon
day, October 21, 1991 at 4 pm in the 
Wherret Room.
Treasurer (Cliff Erickson): Still 
waiting to hear from Ms. Rudman to 
give us a full report of how much money 
we actually have left. Also still waiting 
to hear Thistles response to charges.
Chair (Chris Neighbor): Dali
Newfield has resigned; therefore there 
is a seat available on F&R in addition^ 
an MCS vacancy. Committee ass

Shawn Knight, member atlarge Student Senate, accepted by acclamation,
Robert Earhart, member atlarge Student Senate, accepted by acclamation,
Discussion:
Discussion was held on the topic o| 
not having enough women on the Senate, what should be done about it, and 
how PR can go about solving it.
Rules Committee had pointed out that 
removing a previous question is unnec
essary; discussion was held on the topic 
Senators and members should let the 
debate end on its own; that way every
one gets a chance to speak.
Also, as far as the proper procedure 
for yielding the floor goes, the Chair 
has to determine who yields the floorto 
whom.
Noticed an increase in the numberof 
members at large, this is a good sign for 
the Senate, maybe PR is actually work
ing!

meal plan has caused High

CMDS created the allow

that students would not use 
every meal of the meal plan. 
Given that assumption, the 
allowances were made higher 
than the price a student on a

the Kiltie Court is $5 while a 
student on a 15-meal plan 
actually paid $3.90 per meal).

Thistle delays answering allegations
By JENNIFER FORBES
Tartan News Editor
The Thistle yearbook has yet 
to respond to Student Senate 
regarding the allegations made 
by former business manager 
Ross Comer. Comers charges 
included possible negligence in 
the management of The Thistle.
Senate learned of these 
charges on September 10 and 
decided to form a committee to 
look into this matter. The com
mittee requested that The 
Thistle respond to the disclo
sure and present a preliminary 
constitution to Senate within two 
weeks. Senate Chair Chris 
Neighbor sent a letter with this 
request to Thistle Editor-inChief Kathryn Coonrod. I didnt 
follow up [on the letter] and Katy 
said she never received it, said 
Neighbor.
Coonrod told the committee
that she would have a response Thistles deadlines with its

[The Thistles constitution] is al

and voted upon. 
 Kathryn Coonrod, 
Editor-In-Chief
dent Senate still has not received 
any type of answer.
The Thistles response has 
been delayed because of work on 
the 1992 book, according to Rick 
Antolic, The Thistles darkroom 
manager. Coonrod said she has 
been delayed in responding to 
Student Senate because she has 
been busy with classes and be
cause today marks one of The
charges, Coonrod said, The 1990 
book will be out before Christ
mas. She also said that the 1991 
supplement has not been sent to 
the printer because they have 
not decided if they should send 
it to the 1991 books printer or 
the 1992 books printer.
According to Coonrod, u[The 
Thistles constitution] is almost 
done. It needs to be refined and
voted upon. The entire staff will 
eventually vote to approve the 
constitution. Coonrod has been 
the primary author of the docu
ment, but has received input 
from the executive board of The 
Thistle.
Senate has few courses of ac
tion in enforcing its request. 
Theres not much we can physi
cally do, said Neighbor. Accord
ing to Senate Rules Committee 
Chair Tom Strong, Senate could 
freeze The Thistles funds, put it 
on probation, reduce its recogni
tion to non-funded, or simply 
revoke its recognition com
pletely. The last two are un
likely, said Strong.
The Thistle has signed a con
tract with its printer for the 1992 
yearbook and if Senate froze its 
funds, the book could not be 
printed. Neighbor believes this 
would cause outrage among the 
students.

Gym advisory committee formed to work on improvements
GYM, from page 1
There is some low-cost, 
ground-level planning that can 
be done here, said computer 
science graduate student Erik 
Altmann, who compiled the 
original gym report. Altmann is 
concerned that people who use 
thefacility have a chance to plan 
and see where it is going. The 
committee members will range 
from an aerobics instructor to 
student representatives to 
Harvey.
Junior electrical and chemical 
engineering major Matt 
Shevach, the committees chair, 
is confident that the meeting 
last week improved communi
cation between athletics and stu
dents while conveying the no
tion that the committees goals
are serious and ultimately coin
cide with those of the gym staff. 
Says Shevach, Our purpose is 
first to address the gym report; 
and second, to get started on a 
new survey to include more 
people and more detailed data. 
The responsibility of that report 
is likely to fall on Altmann who 
says that the gym committee 
can only help even if it serves as 
nothingbutan additional lobby
ing force.
While the athletic department 
heads remain reserved, there is 
evidence of optimism. Says 
Harvey, We just dont have a lot 
of flexibility. [The committee] 
will help if they keep a good 
focus on whattheirresponsibilities are. What we need is repre
sentative input, not isolated com
ments.
Some improvements have al
ready been made. Over the sum
mer, the weight room was re
painted and replastered, while

against its own fiscal policy of

Student Senate voted to allo
cate the funds to Greek Council 
on behalf of Theta. At the-time, 
said Colin Crehan, Senate pub
lic relations chair, the fiscal 
policy was binding on the FundingandRecognition Committee,
but not on the Senate as a whole.
The fiscal policy had no offi
cial standing, said Strong. It 
was more or less a tradition that 
Senate had held by for several 
years, but it was nothing offi
cial, added Crehan. Student 
Senate has in the past funded 
other charity events despite the 
policy.
At the next meeting, Senate
I thought the issue was more impor
tant than getting a seat next year. 
 Tom Strong, 
Senate Rules Committee Chair
voted to formalize the fiscal 
policy and adopt it, making it 
binding for the entire Senate. 
At the October 8 meeting the 
policy was officially adopted. 
Were being real concious of 
rules right now, said Crehan. 
We have a new constitution that 
was instituted at the end of last
semester.
Strong said that he didnt 
want to leave a bad precedent ~ 
and that although the discrepancy between funding Mr. FraG

In the future, hopefully well

Senate attempts policy changes
OVERLOAD, from page 1
as Wednesday, October 2,1991, 
PresidentMehrabian expressed 
his unwavering commitment to 
the furthering of the education 
of all undergraduates. The 
document also reports that 
many new students ... do have 
the ability to carry a normal 
[course] load successfully.
The proposal presented by the 
Academic Affairs Committee of 
Student Senate is that the over
load policy as printed in the current Student Handbook be 
amended so that first-year stu
dents, both freshman and trans
fer, have equal access to their 
appropriate College Council for 
exceptions to this policy as their 
upperclassmen peers, to be 
looked at on a case-by-case ba
sis.
The proposal is still being re
viewed by the various adminis
trators  a reply is expected 
within two to three weeks. 
Mehrabian was out of town and
unavailable for comment.
Says Tomblyn of the current 
proposal, which was voted upon 
by all members of Student Sen
ate before the proposal was sent 
to the administrative persons, 
[It] seems to be a paternalistic 
attitude toward the new stu
dents that is most certainly con
tradictory to the implied mis
sion of Carnegie Mellon Univer
sity: to encourage a mature, in
dependent, responsible attitude 
in its students.

FORUM
Thistle, Senate move 
at a snails pace
The Thistle has still not re
sponded to the allegations 
brought before Senate six weeks 
ago by Ross Comer, its former 
business manager. Senate 
formed a committee to investi
gate the charges, which regarded 
the financial management of The 
Thistle. The committee gave The 
Thistle two weeks to formulate 
a response and a preliminary 
constitution. The Thistle, whose 
credibility has been shaken by 
the allegations, has missed dead
line after deadline in getting a 
response to Senate.
Senate, too, has demonstrated 
a lack of commitment to this 
matter. This issue, the possible 
mismanagement of Activities 
Fee funds, is too important to 
the campus community to be 
overlooked.
While Senate has formed a 
committee to look into the 
charges, it has been extremely 
lenient with The Thistle. Senate 
asked for a response by a certain 
date, and, to be effective, has to 
be able to enforce its own dead
lines. The fact that The Thistle 
is allowed to ignore a Senate 
proposal for so long makes Sen
ate look ineffectual.
Senates request was not that 
difficult to meet, either. Senate 
wanted a response to the disclo
sures and a preliminary constitution. The Thistle should want 
to respond immediately, if only 
to clear its name. The prelimi
nary constitution gives The 
Thistle an excellent opportunity 
to reorganize and to prove to 
Senate and the rest of the cam
pus community that it is ca
pable of handling the large sums 
of money it receives to produce a 
yearbook. The delays only make 
The Thistlelookless responsible.
The Thistle also has involved 
very few of its members in for
mulating the preliminary con
stitution. A student organiza
tion should have the input of its 
members, especially when writ
ing a constitution that will ef
fect the organization for years 
to come. Many of the editors 
have not been asked for their 
opinions about what the consti
tution should contain and a few 
were unaware that Senate was 
even investigating The Thistle. 
This lack of communication 
within The Thistle is appalling.
The Thistle needs to answer 
the allegations immediately. 
More delays only taint its image 
further. And Senate needs to 
find a method of effective en
forcement of its policies if it 
wants to gain the campuss re
spect. This issue is far too im
portant for it to be forgotten in 
the typical CMU style.
Gym committee: Make 
improvements quickly
Last February, Erik Altmann 
of the Campus Affairs Commit
tee of Student Senate solicited 
comments on the state of the 
Skibo Gym by posting on the 
org.cs.general bboard, and used 
those comments to form a report 
which was presented to Presi
dent Mehrabian, Vice President 
for Enrollment Bill Elliott, and 
Director of Athletics and Physi
cal Education John Harvey. In 
addition to listing specific com
plaints, the report recommended 
the establishment of an advi
sory committee. Altmann de
manded a response to the report 
by April 30.
Almost six months later, only 
some of the improvements have 
been made, but many others 
have not. The least expensive, 
and perhaps most helpful sug
gestion, the formation of the 
advisory committee, is just now 
getting off the ground.
Its about time. Six months is a 
long time to sit on an issue that 
affects this campus to the ex
tent that the state of the gym 
does. The committee is a good 
sign that changes might get 
made, but theres going to have 
to be more involvement to en
sure that the advisory commit
tee doesnt become a meaning
less token.
To that end, the members of 
the campus community who use 
the gym facilities need to get 
involved with this program. The 
Athletic Department and the 
advisory committee need feed
back on how the improvements 
are going, as well as what else 
needs to be done. Silence im
plies that everything is all right.

the Editor
Harvey in particular, need to 
take a more constructive atti
tude toward the gym improve
ments. Knowing why the prob
lems existis important, but find
ing creative solutions to the prob
lems is far more important than 
assigning blame, no matter how 
legitimate those concerns may 
be.
However, funding is the major 
source of the problems, and some 
of these improvements do require 
funding that the Athletic Depart
ment doesnt currently have ac
cess to. We therefore ask that the 
administration find a way to raise 
the money for these improve
ments. The gym report isnt askingfor radical overhauls or for any 
sort of dream facility; its just ask
ing that the gym be brought up to 
a minimum standard.
Instead of hoping that peoples 
concerns about the gym will 
eventually go away, its time to 
take some steps to make the 
gym a better place. If part of the 
reasoning behind this problem 
is that the facilities in the Uni
versity Center will replace those 
most ailingin the gym, the com
mittee must realize that the 
planned facilities will not be 
available to the majority of stu
dents currently attending CMU.
While we realize that the Uni
versity is not in the position to 
refurbish the entire gym, some 
of the recommendations made 
in the report are low-cost quick 
fixes. We suggest that the advi
sory committee act on these sug
gestions in order to make im
provements now. The advisory 
committee is a good first step, 
but there have to be more steps 
to follow.
Mehrabian extends invi
tation to Festival
Editor:
I am writing to in
vite all members of the 
campus community to 
join me this week in 
celebrating our first 
International Festival. You have each 
received a schedule of events, and I 
want to ensure that you take the time 
to take part in this important campus 
event. I also want to thank Aliya Khan, 
the festival coordinator; Peter Stearns 
and the international festival commit
tee; and all of you who have had such an 
instrumental role in bringing the festi
val to the campus this year.
The focus of the festival this year is 
Asia, and we have a number of exciting 
programs planned throughout the week. 
The festival will open on Tuesday with 
Arthur Holcombe of the United Na
tions and continue with many distin
guished lecturers, artists, and perform
ers throughout the week. Just a few of 
the highlights include Oopalee 
Operajitas dance program on Wednes
day; a lecture by Abid Hussain, the 
Indian Ambassador to the U.S., oh 
Thursday; a Gala including various 
performances on Friday evening; and a 
food festival and student talent show 
on Saturday. Check your schedule for 
a complete list of the dozens of pro
grams offered throughout the festival.
I am excited about this festival, and I 
am looking forward to this opportunity 
to experience a bit of the culture of this 
important part of our world. I hope to 
see each of you at the festival over the 
next five days.

F&R offers explanation 
for event funding
Editor:
Having seen the in
terest over the issue of 
Student Senate fund
ing of Kappa Alpha 
Thetas Mr. Frater
nity, the Funding and Recognition com
mittee would like to put forth its opinion 
on the matter.
We support Thetas annual pageant 
and hope it is as successful as ithas been 
the past. We, as the rest of Senate, feel 
that the event greatly benefits the cam
pus. We thank Theta for its continued 
time and effort, on that note. Mr. 
Fraternitys contribution to campus life 
is not, and has never been, a source of 
controversy within Senate.
We feel the cause for debate has been 
a different issue altogether. This letter 
intends to address this issue and explain 
our position.
It is a well-known fact that the profits 
of the Mr. Fraternity event go directly to 
charity. Senate funding of this event 
violates the Fiscal Policy that F&R must 
abide by. In regards to charity events, it 
reads:
14. Fundingof Events: a. Events which 
donate their proceeds to charity will not 
be funded by the Activities Fee.
The intent of Section 14, Part a. is to 
prevent the collective monies of CMU 
students from going to charity.
Theta was offered a variety of fiscal 
options that would not violate Fiscal 
Policy. One feasible option was to grant 
Theta a loan. There were additional al
ternatives offered butTh eta reiused them 
all.
The issue was raised again due to 
concerns regarding information previ
ously presented by Theta. During these 
two Senate meetings at which the issue 
was discussed, many motions were put 
on the table in order to cater to Thetas 
needs. At one point, a motion was made 
to loan the money needed to produce the 
show, in addition to a guarantee of $ 1000 
profit. (This motion was in violation of 
Fiscal Policy, but Senators were trying 
to reach a compromise at this point.)The 
Mr. Fraternity event was eventually 
funded $880. Senate, as a whole, felt that 
benefits to the campus outweighed viola
tion of Fiscal Policy.
Senate went to great lengths to cater 
to Theta and abide by Fiscal Policy. It is 
unfortunate that a solution meetingboth 
Thetas needs and Fiscal Policys con
straints could not be agreed upon. None
theless, the members of the F&R wish 
the best to Theta and this years Mr. 
Fraternity pageant.

Crime & Incident needs 
special attention
Editor.
We must bring to 
your attention a most 
distressingflaw in an 
otherwise fine paper.
A number of readers, 
ourselves included, look not to the com
ics for weekly entertainment, but to the 
Crime and Incident Report. Nowhere 
else can we get the weekly fix of robber
ies, rabid-cat, and stolen-tree reports
03

that we crave. The last two Crime and 
Incident Reports have been not only 
woefully terse, but dishearteningly 
bland and tepid.
We realize that putting together a 
thirty-page newspaper with full color 
photos and advertisements every week 
is quite a feat for a group of fall-time 
students. Perhaps your staff works so 
hard on the layout of the papei that it 
neglects the publications more recre
ational aspects.
Allow us to humbly propose tliat The 
Tartan take on a staff member whose 
only job would be to compile the Crime 
and Incident Report. Freed of other 
responsibilities, this staff member could 
ensure that the University community 
always has a Crime and Incident Re
port meeting the standard that the rest 
of The Tartan has long established.
We would like to propose our friend 
and colleague, Seth P. Magnum, as an 
ideal candidate for this position. Seths 
comics, including the Itch series that 
The Tartan now runs, demonstrate his 
keen insight into the criminal mind. 
His capacity for objectivity and talent 
for dealing with a story in human terms 
are of a caliber not seen since the hey
day of Dr. Hunter S. Thompson.
We rest assured that you will deal 
with this in a manner consistent with 
the high principles that The Tartan has 
maintained since its inception.

Natural law carries seri
ous ramifications
Editor:
U. S. Supreme 
Court soon-to-be Jus
tice Clarence Thomas 
praise for the implicit 
use of natural law in 
judicial decisions gives legal standing to 
Catholic theological complaints about 
unnatural sex. Using the pretext of 
natural law, the Catholic hierarchy op
poses birth control, sex hygiene items 
such as condoms, sex education in schools, 
abortion, masturbation, and homosexu
ality. Its real motive is to make people 
suffer for having sex.
It still believes virginity is best and that 
all sexual intercourse, even within mar
riage, is somehow impure and regrettable. 
Yet celibacy practiced by the Catholic hier
archy is just as unnatural as birth control.
In Asia 2,400 years ago the Chinese 
philosopher Lao-tse objected to roads, 
carriages, and boats as unnatural. 
Clothes are contrary to nature yet make 
man healthier than the naked savage 
who goes without clothing.
Today we support the idea of inherent 
human rights but these are quite different 
fromnatural law. Since Judeo-Christianitys 
basic cosmological model is essentially monarchial, only acquired, and more specifi
cally, bestowed rights  which are revo
cablecanbefoundin the Bible and many 
rights therein are ethnic group or gender 
based.
Lets not return to the Dark Ages 
under the rubric of natural law.

Whos got time for time management?
Jason McDonald
Pretend that someone hasjust 
thrown a brick at you. Does 
knowing that it will strike you 
in 1.6 seconds really help you 
deal with the problem? If you 
said no, then youve just 
grasped the fundamental flaw 
behind time management.
I learned this when I was try
ing to fill out my generic Carn
egie Mellon Academic Planner 
_ you know, the little red or 
gray book (I chose gray because 
I got really grotesque grades the 
semester I bought a red one) 
that will supposedly organize 
your life foryou. I imagine many 
of you even have one of these 
things, and you probably dont 
find it very useful either.
It was such a n/ce idea, though. 
Many of my friends have these 
books in which they plan their 
lives out to varying degrees, and 
they all seem like happy people 
(Im resisting the urge to add 
shiny to that description). With 
all the job interviews that Im 
eventually going to have to 
schedule on top of the rest of my
life, it seemed like such a won
derful dream to plunk down $3 
and have my karma align with 
the moon, just like in L. Ron 
Hubbards Dianetics.
But look at what I got for my 
money. Blank schedule cards: 
not one, butsuc. If anyone makes 
it halfway through the semester 
and still doesnt know their 
schedule, time management is 
not at the top of that persons list 
of priorities. A lengthy add/drop 
session at the Registrars Office 
is.
A daily calendar. OK, this one 
seems to have some uses, but it 
leaves too many questions. 
What about activities that dont 
have set durations? For ex
ample, Id usually estimate my 
PHI time at about 70 minutes, 
but then along comes the odd 
stomach flu and I have to bail 
out in the first half-hour. That 
or I run out of cash. The point 
being, how do you plan for an 
activity when you dont know 
how long its going to take?
What about procrastination 
time? Should I schedule the 
hour or two that I sit around 
griping about how little I want 
to do something? Face it. Its a 
real constraint if youre any sort 
of normal person. RoboStudent 
doesnt get caught up in an epiI keep picturing a worst-case scenario. If I were to rely on 
my little gray book to dictate my life, a new meeting 
would pop up and I would completely snap and climb 
Warner Hall with an assault rifle.
sode of MacGyver, but the rest of 
us are capable of hating our work 
enough that watching Mac de
fuse his 52nd bomb becomes an 
intensely personal experience.
The other problem of the daily 
calendar is that it makes you rely 
too much on rigid organization. 
It assumes that theres only one 
proper sequence for a given set of 
activities; once its been entered 
into the little fascist book, there 
will be no changes.
I keep picturing a worst-case 
scenario. If I were to rely on my 
little gray book to dictate my life, 
a new meeting would pop up and 
I would completely snap and climb 
Warner Hall with an assault rifle. 
This vision paralyzes me to the 
point that I cant put anything 
more than totally basic things in 
like At 4 am, I will be asleep, and 
even committing that much of my 
life makes me sweat a little.
But if you are going to use this 
calendar, make it interesting in 
case you lose it. Nothing is worse 
than having a summary of your
life floating around campus, ex
cept having others realize youre 
a boring person.
The two ways to protect your
self are to either: 1) disguise 
everything in high-brow lan
guage, or 2) insert a lot of illegal 
activities. The first is simple  
refer to everyone by last name

Abortion battle pits religion against rights
Rich Robinson
The controversy over abortion has be
come one of the most important issues in 
the United States in the past few years. 
[ This controversy doesnt seem to be fad; ing out  if anything, it is gaining more 
; steam. I was brought back to awareness 
\ of this issue after a few recent 
occurrances: an episode of The Ron 
Reagan Show on abortion, the abortion 
protestcalled Life Chain  that lined 
j Forbes Avenue and Fifth Avenue, and an 
interview with Randall Terry, founder of 
i Operation Rescue, in Time magazine.
I realized, perhaps for the first time, 
that the amount of information available 
; about abortion is extraordinary, and I 
set out to wade through it. First of all, 
i there is the semantics issue that con
fused me for a time. With pro-choice, 
anti-choice, pro-life, and pro-death, 
I couldnt figure out what to call which 
group. To avoid getting into what I con
sider a mind game, I will refer to the 
respective groups as pro-choice and 
pro-life.
To start with the pro-choice group, 
abortion is currently legal, and pro-choice 
supporters and activists are seeking to
keep it this way. When the famous Roe 
vs. Wade decision was challenged in the 
late 1980s, the Supreme Court ruled 
that states could determine appropri
ate abortion laws. This ruling challenged 
the fundamental idea of pro-choice, 
which advocates a womans right to 
control her own body.
Pro-choice advocates are at times di
vided over the issue of up to which 
trimester abortion of a fetus should be 
permissable. Most pro-choice advocates 
agree upon legal abortion during the 
first ten weeks.
This is not a major issue, though, as 
over 91 percent of all abortions occur 
within the first 6 to 8 weeks, with only 
.01 percent occurring in the third tri
mester  and then only for medical 
reasons.
The pro-choice movement is also push
ing authorities to allow a French drug, 
RU-486, into the country for FDA test
ing. The drug is an alternative to surgi
cal abortionthe only option currently 
available to American women. The main 
developmental use of RU-486, though, 
is to fight breast cancer, ulcers, 
Cushings syndrome, endometriosis and 
prostate cancer. But because of its sec
ondary use as an abortive alternative, 
the pro-life movement has pressured 
the FDA to keep the drug out of the 
United States.
Overall, the pro-choice movement
wishes to keep abortion legal, and there
fore safe, because it believes that a 
woman should have control over her  
own body without the interference of 
religious or government groups, or an 
individual person.
The pro-life movement, on the other 
hand, opposes abortion on the basis that 
the embryo is a human being and that it
sins of the father.
Terry also denounces pro-choice as sup
porting the use of abortion as birth control. 
What he doesnt seem to take into account 
is the fact that over 90 percent of the people 
seeking abortion did use birth control, ac
cording to a report by the former surgeon 
general, C. Everett Coop. But then, Terry 
also wants to outlaw contraceptive devices
I was surprised to discover that the leaders of 
the pro-life movement are men, not women. 
Also, these men are usually highly religious and 
base their pro-life position on their beliefs ...

the interviews I saw on The Ron Reagan 
Show and the information in the Time 
article I read, I was surprised to discover 
that the leaders of the pro-life move
ment are men, not women. Also, these 
men are usually highly religious and 
base their pro-life position on their be
liefs.
Randall Terry and Joe Scheidler, the 
head of the Pro-life Action League, are 
both of the opinion that a woman should 
not be permitted to have an abortion, 
even in the case of rape or incest. In 
Randall Terrys words, The woman 
should be glad for what God brings.... 
The child should not be punished for the
after abortion is declared illegal, as does 
Scheidler, who said I think contraception 
is disgusting  people using each other for 
pleasure.
In addition, both Scheidler and Terry 
dont just want to make abortion illegal, but 
also want to make the penalty for obtaining 
an illegal abortion a charge of first-degree 
murder. So. not only will a woman have to 
face life-threatening, unsanitary conditions 
to obtain an abortion, but will also face 25 
years to life in prison just because she 
wanted to control her own body.

group Operation Rescue. This group sur

High-speed cyclist: 
friend or foe?
Jeffery Basista
Vehicles and pedestrians have 
always been at odds. Fve never 
fully understood why. I used to 
think that any problems resulted 
from the irresponsibility, care
lessness, or gross stupidity of one 
or the other. However, its be
come clear to me that most acci
dents involving vehicles and pe
destrians serve some useful pur
pose, and most behavior that 
seems irresponsible or stupid is 
actually purposeful. Let me start 
with the perceived problem of 
high-speed bicycling on campus.
I used to think that bicyclists 
who rode around campus at 20 
mph were completely inconsid
erate jerks who dont care about 
the safety of other people. I be
lieved that these cyclists were 
arrogant and that they believed 
they had superhuman control 
over their vehicles. However, I 
am no w sorry for havingbelieved 
such things about those fine
people. High-speed bicyclists 
actually provide valuable ser
vices to society. The exact ser
vices depend on the type of cy
clist: enforcer or altruist.
Enforcers ensure that even in 
our society, which tries to protect 
the weak from the strong, only 
the fittest will survive, or at 
least only they will contribute to 
the gene pool. If one of these fastmoving bicyclists hits and seri
ously injures an errant pedes
trian, society gains. Only people 
with inadequate reflexes will be 
harmed: the more inadequate the 
pedestrians reflexes, the more 
serious the injury; the more seri
ous the injury, the less likely the 
person is to reproduce. Darwin
ism is preserved, and we should 
be thankful to our enforcers.
On the other hand, there are 
kamikaze altruists. These bicy
clists, in their complete selfless
ness, provide a means for physics 
students to collect empirical data 
on the trajectory of projectiles, on 
downward acceleration due to 
gravity, on the coefficient of fric
tion of the sidewalk, and other

DERANGED, from page 9
Yell it out loud while mowing the lawn. 
Print strange pamphlets about it and 
hand them out at malls.
So, now youre insane. People will try 
to lock you up. Dont be fooled by this 
ploy. Tell them you know mental institu
tions are expensive, overcrowded, and 
poorly staffed. If they lock you up, act 
sane for a while and youll be out in no 
time.
Step 2: Arm yourself well.
For first-time psychopaths, a Glock 
17, similar to the gun used at Lubys 
cafeteria in Texas, is a perfect weapon. 
Its a sleek, black piece of plastic and 
metal which looks more like a toy than 
a semi-automatic handgun. Fresh out
of the box, it will hold seventeen 9mm 
bullets, which can be pumped into 
someones body in about ten seconds. If 
youre good, you can reload and empty 
the magazine again in about thirty sec
onds. It is also extremely light and 
maneuverable, adding almost pin-point 
accuracy to its list of attributes.
I called Ace Sporting Goods about get
ting a Glock. They said the first require
ment is that you be a resident ofPennsylvania. Then you have to put down a 20 
percent deposit and wait five days while 
they run a check on you. The man from 
Ace was strangely vague about what this 
check consisted of. It sounds like they 
make sure you really do live in the state, 
and they kind of make sure you dont
you should have several arrests under 
your belt before you get a gun.
If youre out for blood right now, shot
guns and other high-powered rifles can 
be bought and fired the same day. All 
you need is a Pennsylvania drivers 
license or a friend who has one. Ive 
seen gun purchases made this way at 
K-Mart. It takes about five minutes.

McDonalds, playgrounds, and post of
fices. Try something new. Go to parking 
garages or toy stores. Let a few rounds 
loose at the local swimming pool. Make 
the venue dramatic, safe from police 
cross-fire, and, above all, make sure that 
there are a lot of people there. Go for 
some place in a small town. Small towns
are notorious for this kind of activity. If 
you try mass murder in the city, its 
likely you may not be noticed, or people 
may assume youre a cop.
So, its simple to become deranged and 
begin killing people. Children can waltz 
past the gun control laws. High quality 
fire power is available everywhere. 
Schools are breeding grounds for selfloathing and societal contempt. Quality

From what Ive heard, read, 
and seen, the pro-life movement 
seems mainly to be a religious 
activist group.
Therefore, the morality of 
an abortion is based purely on a 
religious battle. Correct me if 
I'm wrong, but in this country, 
the separation of church and 
state mandates that pro-life con
cerns of Gods laws have no
place in the government. All that 
should concern the government 
is the safety of the born. The 
Constitution spells out the rights 
of the born, not conceived.

CMU grabs share of UAA crown
It didnt take long for the offense to 
get into gear. 
Rich Lackner, 
head coach
By JUDY GROSSMAN
Tartan Senior Staffwriter
It started out as a tug of war 
and ended up a one-sided battle.
After trading first-quarter 
touchdowns with Grove City, the 
Tartan offense kicked into high 
gear, pulling away for 36 points 
and a 43-14 win.
It didnt take long for the of
fense to get into gear, said head 
coach Rich Lackner. Once they 
did, Grove City had a very diffi
cult time shutting them down.
Both teams compiled impres
sive offensive numbers; with the 
Tartans holding a slight edge in 
total yards  546 to 413.
But it was the Tartan defense 
that hauled in three intercep
tions and stopped the Wolver
ines on two fourth-down conver
sions deep in CMU territory to 
preserve the victory. And it was 
the Tartans ball-control offense 
that ran the Wolverines into the 
ground, amassing413 yards and
five touchdowns on 55 carries.
104 of those yards came on the 
legs of senior halfback Greg 
Marmol. It was thefifth straight 
100-plus yard performance for 
Marmol, and it catapulted him 
past Mike Hensel into sixth place 
on the Tartans all-time rushing 
list with 1,164 career yards.
Its really the coaches who 
give me the opportunity to run 
the ball as much as I do, said 
Marmol. If it wasnt for them, I 
wouldnt be in a position to 
[break records].
Quarterback Duke Johncour 
gave Grove City its only lead of 
the game with 4:38 left in the
first quarter. His one-yard 
keeper put the Wolverines up, 
6-0.
The touchdown finished off an 
18-play, 77-yard drive that took 
just over eight minutes and 
proved that the Wolverines could 
move the ball against a usually 
stingy Tartan defense. They had 
two fourth-down conversions 
during the drive, including a 16- 
yard completion to Rick Sems on 
fourth and five.
We had a lot of blitzes called, 
different stunts, said linebacker 
Mike Hession. But it seemed 
like we werent getting to him

Enjoyment 
of buggy 
defies logic
There are few things in life 
that look worse on paper than 
the concept of pushing a 
buggyMy friends from other 
schools give me the strangest 
looks when I tell them that I, 
of my own free will, get up at 
5:30 am on weekends to go 
push a hollow tube (containing 
a small person, no less) up a 
hill. Then again, I remember 
thinking the same thing before 
my conversion to Buggyism 
over midsemester break.
Ill admit that the conversion 
isnt complete yet; out of the 
four possible days of rolls, Ive 
only pushed one of them, for a 
whopping total of two rolls.
But it wasnt the quantity of 
time, it was the quality.
My initiation into the world 
of buggy got off to a rocky start 
as I awoke to the sound of my 
ialarm shutting off instead of 
Vgoing on. After the sixtysecond emergency wake-up 
drill, I was on my way to 
EMU. When I arrived at the 
Pioneers buggy HQ, I was 
given the quick version of 
?How To Push Buggy, and I 
was told I was going to watch 
the first round of rolls.
Not so. When the hill assign
ment notebook revealed that 
we were a pusher short, I was 
flung into the breech  Hill 
Three to be exact. My first 
practical lesson in buggy 
pushing was that the only 
thing worse than having to 
[push totally cold is having to 
push the heavy buggy totally 
.cold. To compound my prob
lems, I misjudged how far the 
drnggy would roll out, and 
therefore got the heavenly 
experience of pushing Hill 
Three from an almost dead 
;Stop.
} Of that first push, I can only 
remember two things: hearing 
our push captain yell the 
words Straight arm! over 
and over in my year like some 
insane parrot, and seeing the 
scenery go by very slowly. The 
rest has been blotted out of my 
[memory by the sudden urge to 
hpass out I felt as soon as I 
finished my hill.
J My second push was a little 
easier as I was put on Hill 
Four with a lighter buggy. I 
even became acquainted with 
the art of bumping (though it 
.felt like my bumps had a 
maximum range of seven 
inches). I still felt a little 
'oozy after this run, though, 
so I opted to flag for the next 
set of rolls.
I finally felt really ready to 
go on the fourth rolls  I was 
Eoing to take Hill Three by 
.Btorm this time  but nine
0 dock rolled around, and we 
got pulled in before I got
other chance.
Strangely, although most of 
the specific memories are of 
*e feeling sick, tired, r 
competent, I still had a 
pretty good time. The only 
*ng Im actually down about 
s that I got cheated out of any 
Improvement by Mother 
ature. The latest rolls, which 
vere scheduled for Saturday, 
jjt rained out, so I still 
. avent had any chance to 
earn from my mistakes.
1 Wait, thats not quite true.
S ^ *east I got up on time this
veek.

Crew faces tough 
competition at 
Rochester
By MARK HTT.T.TER
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
The Carnegie Mellon Crew 
Club participated in the Bausch 
and Lomb Invitational Regatta 
in Rochester, New York over 
midsemester break. The regatta 
consisted of two parts; the first 
was a morning five-kilometer 
head piece in which the teams 
race their individual boats 
against the clock, running the 
race in 10-second intervals one 
boat after another in each clas
sification . The second part of the 
regatta was a 1500-meter sprint 
race with two boats racing each 
other and the clock at the same 
time.
The Carnegie Mellon team 
faced strong competition and did 
well, considering some of the 
opposition. Powerhouse teams 
such as Harvard and Yale were 
at the regatta, as well as teams 
from all over the Northeast and 
some from Canada. During the 
morning head pieces, the team 
made a valiant effort.
The CMU heavyweight mens 
boat placed twenty-third out of 
29 competitors. As senior Shawn 
Ohler, last years president, said,
Its not bad considering who 
some of the competition is  
Harvard and Yale and some of 
the other major teams. The 
mens lightweight boat came in 
tenth out of a field of 12 boats. 
The womens boat faced tough 
competition in a large field that 
started out with 25 boats. In the 
afternoons sprint race, Carn
egie Mellon fared well as the 
team was beat by only a small 
margin.
In two weeks, the crew team 
will be travelling to the Head of 
the Occoquan Regatta. This race 
is the first race for this years 
group of novice rowers. The race 
will follow the head piece format 
with boats racing the clock in 
10-second intervals from each 
other. In this regatta, the team 
will be racing six boats; the fe
male novices will race two boats, 
an eight-person boat and a fourperson boat. The male novices 
will race two eights and two 
fours. According to head coach 
Liz Winter, For this race, it 
doe snt matter who is the fastest 
across the finish line to win. It 
matters who makes the least 
mistakes, although being the 
fastest also helps.
Womens soccer
The CMU womens soccer 
team continued its inaugural 
season by defeating an inexperi
enced Pitt-Johnstown team by 
the score of 5-0. The Tartans 
used good passing and a disci
plined game plan to dominate 
the young Johnstown squad.
We dominated the game, from 
beginning to end, said sopho
more forward Rachel Bourn. 
They were an inexperienced 
team, but they played hard and 
didnt give up.
We just played a good game, 
added senior midfielder Eliza
beth Zika. They are a young 
team, so we were able to utilize 
our strong passing and make 
good plays. And the fact that 
they were not used to playing on 
turf hurt them, too. Overall, it 
was just a good game for us. 
Bourn and freshman mid
fielder Christina Isaly scored two 
goals apiece to lead the Tartan 
attack. Junior back Sonya 
Chmielnicki added the final Tar
tan goal.
The win raised the Tartans

Womens tennis 
ends fall season

Freshman Kinga Czerska prepares to return a volley during Saturdays match against Penn State-Behrend. The Tartans beat 
Behrend by a final score of 7-2.
By DARYL DAVIS
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
The womens tennis team gave a very 
impressive showing in their final tour
nament of the fall season. The Tartans 
defeated Penn State-Behrend by a re
sounding score of 72. The Tartans won 
four of the six singles matches and 
came away with victories in all of their 
doubles matches.
Almost all the Tartan victories came 
in decisive two set matches. Sopho
more Sharyn Rotunno defeated Suki 
Fuller (61,6-3), senior Silvina Candia 
beat Sue Moreno (6-1, 6-1), freshman 
Stephanie Kukura downed Karen Ma
jor (6-2, 6-0), and freshman Monika 
Czerska defeated Christine Higgins (6- 
0, 6-1).
The doubles matches were not just 
two-set matches; PSU never won more 
than two games in any single set. Weber 
and Candia knocked off Sjoberg and 
Cathy Shanshala with twin 61 sets; 
Monika Czerska and freshman Cherie 
Lin downed Puller and Moreno, 60,6- 
2; and Rotunno and Kukura won their
match, 6-0, 6-1.
Freshman Kinga Czerska was the 
only Tartan to play a match to three 
sets. She dropped her first set, 6-4 
then rallied in the second set to win, 6- 
2. She was unable to hold on in the 
decisive third set, however, and fell t0 
Shanshalain that set, 6-1. PSUsTalley 
Sjoberg beat sophomore Whitney 
Weber, 6-2, 6-2, for the only other 
CMU loss.
With the victory over Penn StateBehrend, the Tartans end their fal| 
schedule with a season record of 7-8. 
They will begin their crowded spring 
schedule on Sunday, March 22, when 
they travel to Washington D.C. to face 
Catholic University. They then have to 
be in Greensboro, North Carolina on 
March 23 to battle Methodist Univer
sity.
We did pretty well [this fall], considering that most of the team is new," 
said Candia. We have a lot of under
classmen on the team, so I think we 
have a lot of potential. We still struggled 
alittle learning to play together, but we 
did well.

[Johncour] at first. He wasnt fast, but he was 
mobile, and he was able to find his receivers when 
he needed to, especially in the first half.
The Tartans came back on the ensuing posses
sion. Sophomore Jarrod Siket took the kickoff 42 
yards to the Wolverines 36. Theres a complete 
momentum change if everybody does their job and 
we get a big return, said Siket.
Five plays later, Marmol scampered eight yards 
for the game-tying touchdown, and junior Fred 
Harding booted the extra point to give the Tar
tans a 7-6 lead.
The Tartans never looked back. Senior halfback 
Drew Pizzurro darted 17 yards to cap off a 13- 
play, 77-yard drive. Harding added a 21-yard field 
goal in the fading seconds of the first half to give 
the Tartans a comfortable 17-6 lead going into the 
locker room.
The field goal was set up by a 92-yard drive, 
highlighted by a 59-yard Chris Dee-to-Marmol 
strike, that began after a Tartan goal line stand. 
The Wolverines, after a 19-yard run by tailback 
Chad Rush and a facemask penalty against the 
Tartans, were poised to score at the six yardline.
But the defense didnt fold. On fourth and goal, 
the Wolverines desperation trick play was de
fused by junior safety Andy Helms, who batted 
down receiver Tom Miles pass.
It was the first time this season that we held a 
team on four straight downs on 
the goal line, said Hession. Once 
they realized they couldnt run 
on us, they went to a trick play, 
which was a credit to our de
fense.
Each team added atouchdown 
in the third quarter, bringing the 
score to 23-14. Dee hit Marmol 
on a perfectly-timed 42-yard 
touchdown, and Johncour an
swered with a 25-yard touchdown 
strike to Miles. The Wolverines 
added a two-point conversion, 
trimming the Tartan lead to nine.
That was as close as the Wol
verines would get. Early in the 
fourth quarter, Dee scored on a 
one-yard keeper, finishing off a 
six-play, 56-yard drive. Again,
Siket set the Tartans up in excel
lent field position, this time with 
a 28-yard kickoff return follow
ing Miles touchdown.
Returns are so important because they set up 
where you get the ball, said Siket. It was a 
shorter return this time, but it got the ball past 
midfield and we were able to score again.
Down by 14 points with less than a quarter to 
play, Johncour found out the hard way how tough 
the Tartan defense can be. Helms, who had a 
team-high five interceptions goinginto Saturdays 
game, picked off his sixth pass at the Wolverines 
25, and set up yet another Tartan touchdown.
I was just in the right place at the right time, 
said Helms.
Pizzurro broke away for 58 yards before finally 
being brought down at the Wolverines nine 
yardline. Three plays later, junior fullback Griffin 
Pero powered in from the one, and Harding nailed 
the extra point to make the score 36-14.
Then it was deja-vu for the Wolverines, as
Sooner or later, 
if hes going to 
throw the ball 
thirty times a 
game, hes going 
to make a mis
take or two.
 Andy Helms, 
junior defensive 
back
senior comerback Jeff Palaima swiped another 
Johncour pass less than a minute later, returning 
it 38 yards to the Grove City 47. The Wolverines 
got the ball back, but Johncours woes continued 
and he was intercepted again, this time at the 
hands of junior linebacker Mike Kondas.
The interceptions were key, said Hession, 
They really took Grove City out of the game.
Sooner or later, if hes going to throw the ball 
thirty times a game, hes going to make a mistake 
or two, added Helms.
Kondas theft led to the Tartans final touch
down, a 56-yard run by freshman halfback Roger 
Smith on the first play from scrimmage.
The Tartans are now 6-1 overall, and are in 
good position for playoff consideration. Their bid 
for post-season play was aided by second-ranked 
Washington & Jefferson and sixth-ranked 
Frostburg State, both of which were upset on 
Saturday.
Two weeks ago, the Tartans preserved their 
perfect 3-0 conference record with an 1814 win 
over University Athletic Association rival Roch
ester University.
Trailing 7-3 at the half, the Tartans came back 
with a touchdown in each of the final two quar
ters. Pero ran for both scores, the first a nineyarder with 7:32 left in the third.
Marmol, who finished the game with a careerhigh 176 rushing yards, had runs of 14 and 16 
yards earlier in the drive, which 
began after junior linebacker 
Matt Pielert recovered an Isaac 
Collins fumble at the Tartan 28 
yardline.
Hardings point-after was 
blocked, but Tartan junior offen
sive lineman Chuck Jackson 
picked up the loose ball and ran it 
in for two points. The conversion 
put the Tartans on top 11-7 with 
7:32 left in the third quarter.
Sophomore defensive lineman 
Ben Burton had one of the games 
biggest plays. He sacked quarter
back Gregg Eisenberg and caused 
a fumble, which fellow lineman 
Shane Billings recovered at the 
Rochester 25.
An unsportsmanlike conduct 
call against Rochester after the 
fumble moved the Tartans 11
_______________ yards closer, and set up the gameclinching touchdown. This time, 
Pero ran up the middle three yards, stretching the 
Tartan lead to 18-7.
A roughing the kicker penalty against CMU set 
up Rochesters come-back bid. The Yellowjackets 
took 11 plays and 4:24 to score. On fourth and 
three, Eisenberg hit Matt Bergin in the end zone, 
and the Yellowjackets trailed by only four points 
with 4:06 left.
But Helms made sure Rochester did not come 
back. In the games final minute, with the 
Yellowjackets threatening to score at the CMU 
38, Helms intercepted a Kevin Gelabert pass and 
ran it back 25 yards.
The win insured the Tartans of at least a tie for 
the UAA championship. They can win their sec
ond consecutive conference title outright by beat
ing Case Western Reserve University in the sea
son finale.
The Carnegie Mellon soccer 
team returned to University Ath
letic Association action this 
weekend with a road trip to 
Atlantas Emory University and 
New York University. Yester
day at NYU, the played its final 
road game of the season; the 
Tartans got two overtime goals 
to gain a 2-0 victory over the 
Violets. The win gave the Tar
tans a 3-2-1 record in the UAA,
and a 733 record overall.
After battling to a scoreless tie 
through regulation and the first 
overtime, the Tartans broke the 
ice in the second overtime pe
riod. Junior stopper John 
Stivoric scored 3:24 into the sec
ond overtime off a pass from 
freshman Alex Amezquita, and 
freshman midfielder Vince 
Russell added a second goal two 
minutes later, assisted by sopho
more Min Chong. The Tartans 
then proceeded to shut the Vio
lets down the rest of the way.
On Friday, the Tartans ninegame unbeaten streak (six wins, 
three ties) came to a close with a 
1-0 loss to Emory University.
The team will finish its season 
with four home games: Grove 
City will pay a visit to Gesling 
Stadium Wednesday night at 
7:30 pm, the University of Chi
cago (the last UAA opponent of 
the season) will come to town on 
Saturday afternoon at 1:30 pm, 
and Bethany College and 
Dickinson College will finish the 
season next week.

losing money on them. But, any
way....
Tonights game shouldbe quite 
uneventful  OK, Im being fa
cetious. The Cincinnati Bengals 
have tormented the Buffalo Bills 
the past few years. If ever the 
Bengals were to pull a huge up
set and give Sam Wyche a vic
tory, it would be tonight. I dont 
expect such an occurrence, 
though. (Cincinnati will be lucky 
to get a victory this year. They 
will, but it wont be easy.) Take 
the Bills, 34-20.
Sunday features two big 
games. The undefeated Wash
ington Redskins travel to the 
New Jersey Meadowlands to 
take on the division rival New 
York Giants. The Giants played 
well for a half against the Pitts
burgh Steelers; of course, Bubby 
Brister gave the Giants a lot of 
help. The Redskins havent fal
tered much yet this year. They 
allowed Cleveland to score at 
RFK last week, but besides 
that....
The Giants need to play a per
fect game to beat the invinciblelooking Skins. They wont play 
that perfect game, but the 
Redskins wont, either. Ive 
heard comparisons to the 1972 
Miami Dolphins in reference to 
the Redskins. Lookforthis game 
to silence such comparisons. 
Giants 27, Redskins 23.
And a game that is of impor
tance to locals and Steelers fans, 
the evil Cleveland Browns are 
hosting the Steelers Sunday. 
Neil ODonnell could be making 
his second professional start 
against the division rivals, de
pending on hisperformance yes
terday. I personally would like 
to see him continue as quarter
back. Anybody could outplay 
Bubby. As much as it pains me, 
though, I have to take the 
Browns over the Steelers. 
ODonnell is inexperienced, and 
the Browns will take advantage 
of this point. Brownies 34, 
Steelers 17.

werent the Thomas confirma

Isnt it interesting, though, how 
the networks had no problems

for one day, I think.

overrated while sitting on the

By JASON MCDONALD
Tartan Sports Editor
On Tuesday afternoon, I wrote 
about four thousand characters 
previewing a Pittsburgh-Minnesota World Series. Look what a 
great idea that turned out to be. 
As much anguish as I am in 
about the Pirates loss to the 
Braves (which is quite a lot, con; sidering I had to suffer the hu
miliation of being at Three Rivi ers Stadium for Game Seven of 
the NLCS), the baseball season 
goes on.
In that vein, I humbly offer 
World Series In a Minute. I 
know its just another example 
j of kow-towing to the attention 
span of the average college stu
dent, but I go with what works.
Its the battle of the Cinderella 
teams, a battle of small-market 
teams  that is, a really boring 
matchup. The telltale sign of this 
is that the Series is being sold as 
the battle of gimmicks  
Minnesotas Homer Hankies 
against Atlantas Tomahawk 
Chop (a complete Florida State 
ripoff).
Admittedly, both teams bring 
new meaning to the term dark 
horse. Minnesota has been liv
ing the charmed life, after being 
picked by most people to finish 
last in the AL West. The Twins 
got off to a flying start and never 
looked back. Solid pitching, in
cluding Cy Young candidate 
Scott Erickson and Comeback 
Player of the Year favorite Jack 
I Morris, and clutch hitting proi pelled the Twins to the division 
t j lead.
I Atlanta had even more of a 
I p'nderella season. They stunk 
| in the first half of the season.I
 Other than Cy Young candidate 
I '1 om Glavine, the startingpitchngwas atrocious. However,free 
agent acquisitions  first 
baseman Sid Bream, shortstop 
Rafael Belliard, and third 
baseman Terry Pendleton (their 
wn Comeback Player candiI date, as well as a strong MVP 
j contender)strengthened team 
defense as well as providing a
I ^wmorebats.Thebatskeptthe 
| Braves on the fringe of the NL 
| West race, and when the pitchII ln8 came around, the Braves
overtook the Los Angeles Dodg
ers, despite losing Otis Nixon, 
their leadoffman, to a drug sus
pension right in the middle of 
the stretch run.
The Series looks like this: the 
Twins have the better talent 
my position-by-position account 
gives designated hitter, first 
base, second base, catcher, right 
field, center field, and left field 
to the Twins (you can argue if 
you want; thats justhow I see it) 
while the Braves only get third 
base. Both teams shortstops
suck, so I called that even.
The starting pitching goes to 
theTwins, even though Erickson 
and Morris slumped part of the 
way through the year. The 
Braves have a slight advantage 
in the bullpen, although 
Minnesotas Rick Aguilera is the 
best single relief pitcher of ei
ther team.
Then again, the Pirates had 
betterplayers than Atlanta, and 
look what happened. However, 
Im betting thats not going to 
happenhere.Twinsin six games.

All students (except CIT/MCS freshmen) should register during Registration Week if they wish to enroll for Spring 1992. If you won't be returning (for reasons other 
than graduation), submit an Application for Withdrawal or Leave of Absence (marked "Spring 1992) to the Registrar's Office, Warner Hall 201.
All currently-enrolled students (except CIT/MCS freshmen) will first receive a Biographic Update Sheet and a letter explaining the registration process; review the Bio 
Update Sheet, make corrections and submit the form to the Registrar's Office (if there are no changes, keep the form). A Registration/Add/Drop form is enclosed in 
each Spring 1992 Schedule of Classes, which will be available on October 24 at the Skibo Information Desk, outside the CFA Dean's Office and inside the main

Hand to Hand offers support
Hand to Hand, CMU's hearing impaired 
awareness society, is working hard, undertaking 
everything from signing classes to arranging a 
performance from the country's foremost hear
ing impaired comedienne, Kathy Buckley. Un
der the supervision of junior industrial design 
major Jennifer Gaspari, senior chemical engi
neering major Russ Lehrer, and senior creative 
writing major Bob Dixon, the society has made a 
lot of progress in improving the position of the 
hearing impaired on campus, as well as in 
Pittsburgh.
The idea for the group came about when a sign 
language class sponsored by Housing had to be 
cancelled because the 15-person minimum was 
not filled. "We decided that there should be 
more awareness on campus of the hearing 
impaired," said Gaspari. She and a few friends 
formed the group, which consists of both hear
ing and hearing impaired people.
Hand to Hand meets regularly, coordinates 
activities such as lectures, and arranges for the 
viewing of videotapes about relevant issues 
including signing, sign-singing, and etiquette 
(for example, you shouldn't chew gum while 
speaking to a hearing impaired person; this 
makes it difficult for him or her to read your 
lips). The group also addresses issues concern
ing hearing impaired students  some need to 
sit in the front of class to read lips while some 
need a student tutor to take notes for them > 
and ensures that hearing impaired people will
feel comfortable at CMU. There are also field 
trips to Deaf Awareness Days events, where the 
group mingles with other people in a large 
social setting and addresses issues of concern to 
the hearing impaired.
The group's biggest endeavor this year will be 
to get renowned hearing impaired comedienne 
Buckley to perform here during Disability Week 
in early March. Organized by junior H&SS 
student Jonathan Berger, Disability Week will 
address issues of all disabilities, including those 
of the hearing impaired. Gaspari has scheduled 
Buckley for March 6 during Disability Week and 
has secured funds and support for the event 
from Student Senate, Student Affairs, Housing, 
GSO, the Women's Center, and the Activities 
Board.
Hand to Hand is open to all interested people, 
and not only promotes signing but awareness of 
the hearing impaired in general. On October 21 
at 6 pm, the group will present University of 
Pittsburgh student Jean Kelly, a third year 
signing student, who will speak on issues con
cerning the hearing impaired as a part of her 
degree requirement. For more information, 
contact Gaspari at x4869 or leave a message in 
the Hand to Hand mailbox at the Skibo Informa
tion Desk.

Find fulfillment through volunteering
If you have the desire to volunteer but don't 
know where to start, don't give up on the idea. 
Maybe all you need is a nudge in the right 
direction, or some guidance as to what the next 
step ought to be. Harriet Schwartz, assistant to 
the dean of Student Affairs, can answer most of 
your questions about what you can do and 
where to go.
Schwartz, who has an extensive background in 
the area of volunteer work, has seen a variety of 
reasons why some students seem unable to get a 
foot in the volunteering door. "Students who 
want to volunteer come [to me] from a variety of 
situations," said Schwartz. "[Some students] 
don't know how to make connections with 
committees, or where to start."
The best place to start is to figure out what you 
want to do and why. Schwartz suggested a few 
questions students might want to consider when 
they start thinking about the kind of volunteer
ing they would like to do.
What are your motivations? People who 
volunteer have a variety of reasons why they 
enjoy helping other people. According to 
Schwartz, "people are often hesitant to admit 
that doing community service is as good for 
them as it is for the people they serve." There's 
nothing wrong with getting as much out of 
volunteering as you put in; the only thing you 
need to keep in mind, according to Schwartz, is 
that "volunteers should base the service [they 
do] on what the people they serve need."
What population do you want to serve? Here, 
the term "population" refers to the group of 
people on which the community service is 
focused. For example, a person who is interested 
in working with the elderly wants to serve an 
older population. If there is a specific population 
you would like to help, you can narrow down 
your search to volunteer groups and agencies 
that help that population. "Try to think of one 
you'd be comfortable with and would enjoy," 
said Schwartz.
What issues do you want to address through 
your service? In the same way that you might 
want to help a certain population, you could 
also feel motivated to help a certain cause or 
social issue. "Just about any issue you encounter 
in class or on television will have community 
service agencies that can use your help," said 
Schwartz. "Some students feel like they're in a
good position and want to help those less fortu
nate."
What skills do you want to use and/or de
velop through your service? Believe it or not, 
volunteering can be as rigorous as an internship, 
in terms of developing the skills that will one 
day, hopefully, land you a job. There is even the 
fringe benefit of knowing that while you 
sharpen your skills, you are helping others.
Even if you are wondering if you are ready to 
use the things you learned in class in a real 
world setting, don't let that stop you. Schwartz 
said that you don't have to worry about "feeling 
you don't have the skill or knowledge to do 
community service. You just have to be commit
ted and work hard."
How much time do you have to devote to 
volunteering? This is probably what keeps a lot 
of students from volunteering. Volunteering can 
seem like a large time commitment, and time is 
one of a college student's most precious com
modities. "[The commitment] can range from 
Saturday afternoons to volunteering a couple of 
hours a week," said Schwartz. Volunteering 
doesn't have to monopolize your time. "You 
don't necessarily have to put in 5-10 hours a 
week," she said. "Short term projects are an 
option."
What are the obstacles you need to consider 
in terms of volunteering? Schwartz describes 
the obstacles you can encounter as a volunteer 
as everything from "academic demands to 
transportation." There are lots of factors that can 
keep you from volunteering when and where 
you'd prefer. Schwartz's advice is that "you 
want to pick one that [you'll be able to do]."
If you want to discuss any of the topics above, 
or if you just want to sort out exactly what 
volunteering is all about, you can make an 
appointment to talk to Schwartz individually at 
Student Affairs, or you can get a group of stu
dents together and call Student Affairs to sched
ule a Take 30 program about volunteering. With 
a Take 30 program, the entire group will be able 
to speak with someone who will give you in
sight on how to get a volunteer group started, 
how to work with volunteer agencies, and other 
issues that you should consider.
Student Affairs is also working with Housing 
to get a community service newsletter started on

By bringing the 
children to a 
place of higher 
learning, the 
[Role Models 
Program] 
hopes to fill the 
widening gap 
between 
middle-and 
lower-class 
working people.
Beyond academics: role models
Every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, 
children from the third to fifth grade in innercity schools are being exposed to Carnegie 
Mellon's campus, student tutors, and a vision of 
the future they might never have seen if they 
stayed in the Hill District. These children are 
participants in the Role Models Program, the 
purpose of which is to "expose inner-city chil
dren to positive environments, educational and 
career opportunities, as well as positive role 
models," according to Elaine Atkinson, a secre
tary in the Psychology Department. Atkinson 
planned the program for over two years and 
played a key part in its success.
Ten Carnegie Mellon students act as role 
models and tutors for the children. "We stress 
education, career opportunities, and goal set
ting," said Atkinson. She hopes that if the chil
dren set goals for themselves, they will avoid 
some of the problems plaguing inner-city neigh
borhoods. "Going to college and earning good 
grades [do] not mesh with getting pregnant and 
dropping out of high school. Getting scholar
ships does not mesh with doing drugs," said 
Atkinson.
"Black communities were not always the way 
they are today," said Atkinson. By bringing the 
children to a place of higher learning, the Role 
Models Program hopes to fill the widening gap 
between middleand lower-class working 
people. "Poor kids need role models, role mod
els need to see that poor kids are wonderful 
people," said Atkinson.
The program provides the opportunity for 
people to build lasting relationships. Some of 
the friendships go beyond the program. When 
the tutors last semester went on spring break, 
they sent postcards to the students; the children 
felt special. "When I brought them back for the 
summer, they asked about every tutor, they 
asked where they are and what they are doing," 
said Atkinson.
The first week of the program is spent at the 
home school in the Hill District. After that, the 
children come to CMU for three days a week, 
two and a half hours each day. During that time, 
helping them with their homework is first on the 
agenda. "We are trying to build skills that will 
enable the child to be a good student. The mes
sage is 'education as a means out of poverty/ " 
said Atkinson.
But the program goes beyond academics, and
discusses social and self-development issues, 
such as drug awareness, black history, nutrition, 
exercise, decision-making skills, and communi
cation skills. "We do role playing, and we have 
the best time/' said Atkinson. "I talk them 
through real-life situations that will very [likely] 
happen to them, being young adults. At each 
decision point I stop and ask them, 'What do 
you do here?'"
"In one skit I played a junkie who had chil
dren," said Atkinson, "and all I cared about was 
my drugs. I told the kids about all the things I 
did to get my drugs, no matter what it took. I'm 
saying things like Tm not buying that food 
'cause I have to have my cocaine.' They're say
ing, 'But you had those kids, you have to take 
care of them.' But I'm hooked, and my mind and 
my life is not my own anymore because of 
drugs. That message was very well conveyed in 
that skit."
The program teaches the children the impor
tance of communication skills. "I learned that 
they know grammatical English, they just don't 
speak it," said Atkinson. "I wrote incorrect 
sentences on the board, and before I could finish 
writing them, they were all screaming out the 
right answers." The program teaches that casual 
langauge is fine with their friends, but at the 
same time they need to have these other skills. 
"When the children say 'I ain't got no/ the code 
is 'Excuse me?' and they say the sentence prop
erly. It becomes a game and everybody's correct
ing everybody," said Atkinson.
The Role Models Program also tries to show 
the children as much as possible what a college 
campus can offer. "We take the children to as 
many laboratories and classrooms on campus as 
possible," said Atkinson. Last year they visited 
the Biology, Mechanical Engineering, Architec
ture, and Art Departments. The CMU faculty 
members gave workshops, at a thirdto fifthgrade level, in the professors' areas of study.
"All the professors were just wonderful in 
communicating with the children," said 
Atkinson, "All of them said they would do it 
again."
"Many people feel the need to give, but they 
have no vehicle to do it," said Atkinson. The 
Role Models Program is trying to provide that 
vehicle. "The faculty get to see the children 
smile or their faces light up when they show 
them an engine, or a building they designed, or

a sculpture they crafted," said Atkinson. "Every
body knows it's worthwhile; there is no question 
about it."
The program also benefits the undergraduate 
students who participate as tutors. They are 
learning about the communities in which they 
live and are also getting practical experience in 
helping people and dealing with social issues. It 
fits into some people's majors to have experi
ence working with children or social behavior. 
This semester, about 50-60 students inquired 
about the tutoring positions, so there is a lot of 
interest. Atkinson said the potential to expand is 
there.
The first semester of the program was ex
tremely successful. Atkinson said, "It was like 
magic. You couldn't ask for a better response 
rate anywhere. Parents clearly identified im
provements in the attitudes of. the children."
Last semester, 30 students from A. Leo Wiel 
Elementary School participated. Lawrence 
Davis, principal of A. Leo Weil, describes it as 
having had "a tremendous impact on the lives of 
the student participants." He said students who 
have no history of college in their family back
grounds have been discussing college. He also 
said, "Students are becoming more thoughtful in 
their decision-making. Parents are discussing 
school and the future more often with these 
youngsters." This semester, the program in
cludes children from Miller Elementary School, 
also in the Hill District.
As for other changes this semester, Atkinson 
wants the children to operate a small business
on campus. She tried this during a 10-day sum
mer session at Carnegie Mellon, when the chil
dren made friendship bracelets. "Just during the 
10 days we earned almost $400 selling bracelets 
to just the Psychology Department," said 
Atkinson. The proceeds from selling the friend
ship bracelets go toward scholarship funds for 
the children. This semester, the children will 
make friendship bracelets and sell them to CMU 
students in Grey Matter. "The children will act 
one-on-one with the Carnegie Mellon students," 
said Atkinson. "So it's a very worthwhile cause 
and the children learn about operating a busi
ness, about investment, about profit, and about 
turning out a product that's good. This will not 
only heighten their awareness of economics, but 
will also build their social skills."
Atkinson hopes to expand the program even
tually. Right now it is sponsored in part by 
Carnegie Mellon, the Henry C. Frick Educa
tional Commission, the Ernest Hillman Founda
tion, and the Mines Safety Appliances Company 
Charitable Trust. "We're hoping that this will 
catch on, because there are so many universities 
in this city, in this country," said Atkinson.

ing to Schwartz, will be "to disseminate infor

The Food Bank of Greater Pittsburgh provides 
food for many of the soup kitchens, food pan
tries and homeless shelters in Southwestern 
Pennsylvania. According to Cynthia Moore, the 
Food Bank's volunteer coordinator, "the Food 
Bank distributes food to over 350 agencies that 
service people in need." When most people 
think of the Food Bank and how they can help, 
they think about donations of canned food and 
unperishable items. However, the Food Bank 
does even more, and is heavily dependent upon 
volunteer support.
The Food Bank has arranged a gleaning pro
gram, in which local farmers tell the Food Bank 
that they've already reaped their harvests, and 
allow volunteers from the Food Bank to search 
the field and collect whatever is left. "All we 
need to have is people who'll agree to come with 
us," said Moore. Although the Food Bank gets 
most of its fresh produce from local and national 
donations  the Food Bank is a member of 
Second Harvest, a network of food banks across 
the nation. Every bit helps.
Fernando DeGuia, a sophomore in H&SS, got 
involved with the Food Bank through Harriet 
Schwartz, assistant to the dean of Student Af
fairs. "[Schwartz] gave me brochures about a 
gleaning project, and got me interested," said 
DeGuia. Although the first program arrange
ments with students were made in early Septem
ber, DeGuia hasn't actually gleaned yet. "The 
only thing we've done is work at the ware
house," he said.
The warehouse where the Food Bank stores its 
food is the heart of the Food Bank, the area 
where the Food Bank stores its food. According 
to Moore, it's "the largest food bank [ware
house] in the world in terms of storage space." 
The work that volunteers do in the warehouse 
helps so many agencies in the area and through
out Southwestern Pennsylvania that even a 
small amount of time volunteered means a lot.
Although DeGuia enjoys volunteering for the 
Food Bank, he has encountered some obstacles. 
For instance, the students who work for the 
Food Bank often have to take the bus, and the 
warehouse is a three-zone bus ride from cam
pus. "If everyone had taken the bus [every time 
we went]" said DeGuia, "it would have cost us. 
$50-$60." The students are hoping to get more 
drivers in the group, or arrange through the 
Food Bank to have a van take them to the ware
house.
When asked why he volunteers, DeGuia de
scribed a situation when he was in Oakland and 
saw a homeless person who was asking for 
money so that he could eat. Instead of giving the 
man the money, he walked to a nearby store and 
bought the man a sandwich. That way, DeGuia 
knew exactly how his money helped the home
less man. "He appreciated it more," DeGuia 
said, "and I felt better about it."
DeGuia had prior experience with volunteer
ing, and the situation made him think about 
how he could help the people he saw. He 
wanted to do "something less passive," and 
volunteering was it. It's his way of "making sure 
that the people who do get our help are the 
people who need it."
The Food Bank, in turn, depends on the sup
port of people like DeGuia. Moore said, "[the 
Food Bank is] an organization that could not 
function without volunteer support."
Moore went on to say, "If you look at the 
social problems our country is faced with... 
some of the big ones, including hunger and 
homelessness... we can eliminate some of these 
as a nation if we all help." If you're interested in 
volunteering for the Food Bank, call Moore at 
672-4949.

The
Community 
Literacy 
Center (CLC) 
involves young 
adults from 
Pittsburgh high 
schools.... 
Groups of 
teens..,, leam 
not only how 
to write well 
but also how 
to use writing 
for practical 
purposes....
Literacy volunteers bridge 
communication gap
The First Allegheny Community Center and 
Carnegie Mellon have joined forces to form the 
Community Literacy Center (CLC). They are 
committed to helping local young people de
velop the ability to clearly express ideas and 
opinions through writing. The CLC and the 
teens involved with it have created a more vital 
definition of literacy, a definition that denotes 
"action, power, and collaboration."
"It is wonderful to work with these kids," says 
Linda Flower, a CMU English professor and 
president of the CLC Board of Directors. "They 
have a lot of energy. You see real growth in self
esteem. Kids who haven't seen themselves as 
succeeding become writers, problem solvers, 
and leam to speak up with adults." Recently, at 
a meeting to assess a CLC project, a young man 
who had participated in the CLC project stood 
up and said, "What I learned is that I wasn't 
dumb." That is the impressive result of the 
efforts of the Community Literacy Center.
The CLC involves young adults from Pitts
burgh high schools, mainly Perry and Oliver. 
Groups of teens meet at the Union Avenue 
Community House and leam not only how to 
write well, but also how to use writing for prac
tical purposes, a skill most high school programs 
unfortunately ignore. The students then apply 
their writing abilities to projects, many of which 
they themselves conceive. The groups and 
projects are categorized in one of three pro
grams: WRITE, HELP, or ARGUE.
The WRITE program allows teens to address 
their problems and concerns. Its projects have 
included two booklets addressing teenage 
pregnancies. In the introduction to one of the 
booklets, Teen Pregnancy, Director Wayne C.
Peck of the Community House, writes, "We 
often hear TV reports condemning the rising 
rates of teen pregnancy in our city neighbor
hoods. We seldom pause to hear the voices of 
the teens themselves telling us what they have 
learned as a result of being parents.... The au
thors of this document wanted to build new 
bridges of understanding between teenagers 
and adults."
The booklet contains real experiences and 
honest stories, the results of interviews between 
CLC participants and young mothers, and in 
one case, the mother of a teenage mother. The 
booklet leaves one with a markedly different 
perspective of teenage pregnancy than the often
pessimistic and critical reports one might expect 
from adults.
The second booklet, Teen Parent: Questions and 
Answers, is the result of much research by the 
students who created it. It addresses concerns 
such as finances, education, employment, hous
ing, nutrition, and post-partum depression, and 
provides lists of clinics and other places to seek 
help.
Another WRITE project, a booklet entitled 
Going Places, is a compilation of students' essays 
about places in Pittsburgh to visit and the results 
of typical activities such as "standing on the 
corner."
Once the booklet was completed, its student 
authors met with community and school leaders 
to discuss possible ideas and improvements, 
such as the purchase of a van to transport par
ticipants to and from local areas of interest. 
Flower noticed that having a concrete text dur
ing these meetings gave the students "a real 
sense of the significance of what they were 
doing."
The HELP program focuses on community 
action. The 1991 summer project exemplifies a 
typical HELP project. Students decided to con
struct an outdoor courtyard for the senior citi
zens of the Perry South Senior Center. They first 
sought input from the people who utilize the 
Senior Center. The teens therefore had the needs 
and desires of the senior citizens in mind when 
they planned the site with a professional archi
tect. Then they actually built the courtyard.
This, however, was hardly the last step. The 
teens wrote a press release and planned a ribbon-cutting ceremony for the opening of the 
courtyard, and decided how to communicate 
with the media and conduct interviews with 
radio, television, and print reporters at the 
opening. Finally, they wrote and published a 
booklet outlining and describing their experi
ences.
The ARGUE program, although it involves 
less direct action than the preceding projects, is a 
vital part of the CLC. It consists of problem
solving workshops and meetings in which 
community groups come together to discuss 
agreements and work to resolve differences. The 
program also teaches groups to draft, revise, 
and produce formal written statements that 
speak clearly to their audiences.

CMU tutors inspire young minds
There is an elementary school in Squirrel Hill, 
almost within walking distance of campus, 
called Colfax Elementary. It is a public school, 
and as is the case with many public schools in 
the nation, the teachers at Colfax are under a 
great deal of pressure to give each of their stu
dents the best education they can without ne
glecting the needs of the other children. The 
need for someone to help the students who are 
in danger of missing out on the fundamentals  
such as reading, writing and arithmetic  
inspired CMU English Professor Richard Enos 
to enlist student help.
"Most of my children went to Colfax," said 
Enos. "[My wife and I] have seven children, so 
in a way, we had an opportunity to really watch 
the school.... We saw that a lot was demanded of 
the teachers, that there was a real need there."
He approached Pat Nysewander, the principal 
of Colfax, with the idea and later approached 
students in his classes with it. He explained that 
some of the children at Colfax were having 
problems learning basic, important skills like 
reading and writing. After making clear that 
anyone who volunteered wouldn't receive a 
grade or be paid for the work, he asked anyone 
who was interested to see him after class. And 
the students came.
"Students would come up to me afterwards 
and say, 'I really want to do this.' So they were 
the ones who really got the ball rolling." From 
then on, Enos has been asking his students to 
volunteer to help the students at Colfax. The 
students who volunteer work directly with 
Colfax. "I do very little of this," said Enos, "a 
few phone calls, some talking  the students do 
all of the work."
The students have become the heart of the 
program and according to Enos, the arrange
ment has been working well. Some of the stu
dents became very deeply involved with volun
teering for Colfax. "Some of them wound up 
going once a week; one student even stayed on 
after leaving Carnegie Mellon," said Enos.
"What the CMU students are doing is stepping 
in and trying to help [students at Colfax]," said 
Enos. "And the indirect message to these kids is 
that someone from Carnegie Mellon really cares 
enough to come out and sit with them... and be 
with them."
Sometimes, according to Enos, the children at 
Colfax can be a bit overwhelmed by the idea 
that a CMU student has come to help them out. 
"[Some of the students] get used to negative 
attention," Enos said. "They just cannot believe 
that [our students] are doing this at first. They're 
getting good role models.... Sometimes meeting 
a role model at the right time is all they need."
The students tutoring at Colfax have as much 
of an effect on the community as they have on 
the young students. "[The University has] an 
image that what [professors and students here] 
do is in order to get a job, or for money," said 
Enos. "I really like it that people get a chance to 
see what, I think, is really representative of the 
students of this University, which is a lot of 
people who are hard-working and compassion
ate."
The reason why Enos has generally relied 
upon his classes to recruit students is that he can 
recommend "students who have had courses on 
writing and know what they're doing" to the 
principal, knowing he can personally assure that 
they're qualified for the work.
"There's an art to teaching [there]," Enos said. 
"It's knowing when to lay off and when to get 
the best performance out of the students, but not 
get them exhausted or frustrated."
The teaching that the students do at Colfax 
and the devotion they put into it are important. 
"If these kids don't get these skills down [before 
around the third grade], they're dead in the 
water," said Enos. And although he said that he 
doesn't mean to imply that they wouldn't be 
able to get those skills later in life, "they will 
have to overcome enormous obstacles if they 
don't get it now."
Enos added, "we really need to help the teach
ers [at our area public schools], because we're 
asking them to do everything." Enos went on to 
talk about how teachers are sometimes expected 
to fill in the emotional gaps in a child's life. 
Through the tutoring program, CMU students 
help the elementary school children prepare for 
the road ahead.

Cyrus 
Akbarian 
[president of 
the CMU 
chapter of Big 
Brothers & 
Sisters] has 
been in the 
program ever 
since he was a 
freshman... [it] 
was the first 
time that he'd 
had a sibling.
Littles grow with Big Brothers & Sisters
"By far, some of the best memories I'll have 
from this school are from my Little Brothers," 
said Cyrus Akbarian, a senior psychology major 
and president of the CMU chapter of Allegheny 
County's Big Brothers & Sisters program. "It 
might sound strange, but it's true," said 
Akbarian. "It's a lot of fun."
Akbarian has been in the program for four 
years, ever since he was a freshman. He'd had 
experience with volunteering while he was in 
high school, but this was the first time that he'd 
had a sibling. "I'm an only child," said 
Akbarian, "and I had no idea what it was like to 
have a little brother."
Now, in addition to having his own "Little," 
he gets to know everyone in the CMU group. "I 
know all the Bigs and Littles, and I make it a 
point that they know me," said Akbarian. "It's a 
loose-knitted group, but everybody knows who 
everybody is."
The main reason why the group has to be 
loosely connected is that the focus of the group 
is the one-on-one time that students spend with 
their Littles. But there is some interaction be
tween Bigs and Littles at group events, which 
take place about two or three times a semester, 
where small groups of Bigs and Littles spend 
some of their time together. "I met a ton of 
upperclassmen as a freshman in the program," 
said Akbarian. "It was the last thing I was think
ing of, [but] it just happened."
Each Big Brother or Sister spends an average 
of four hours a week with his or her Little. 
"When you're actually with the [Little], those 
four hours fly," said Akbarian. He said that he 
has seen changes in the children in the program 
over time because of the devotion of the volun
teers. "The people involved are the best, and 
they've got a lot of heart or they wouldn't be 
involved."
According to Akbarian, Big Brothers & Sisters 
has become more "vocal and active" since the 
CMU chapter was first established in 1985. The 
CMU chapter of Big Brothers & Sisters has been 
postering the campus with meeting times and 
letting people know how to get involved. "Re
cruiting is one of the most important things [we 
do]," said Akbarian.
Once a student decides to become a Big, a 
screening process begins. According to Julie 
Kreyns, a recruiter and caseworker at the Al
legheny County chapter of Big Brothers & Sis
ters, the screening process for students is gener
ally the same as it would be for any other adult 
who wanted to be a Big. The only exception that 
Big Brothers & Sisters makes for students is that 
they waive the requirement that a Big has to be 
at least 25 years old and agree to be a Big for at 
least a year. Students are given leeway as far as 
the time commitment because of holidays and 
breaks between semesters, when students from 
out-of-state would probably go home.
The screening process begins with the volun
teer filling out a basic form with his or her 
address. The volunteer is then invited to an 
orientation at the office, which is located on 
Craig Street. At the orientation, the volunteer 
fills out Act 33 and 34 clearances, which are 
forms for a statewide background check for a 
child abuse or any other crimes. He or she also 
fills out a personality inventory similar to the 
ones that freshman fill out far Housing before 
they are matched with a roommate. Finally, the 
volunteer is asked for four references: three 
personal references and <|ne from an employer.
Once all of the information about the volunteer 
has been processed and the background checks 
have been completed, he or she is invited back 
to the office for some child development train
ing, so the future Big will know what to expect 
from children of any age. Then the Big is ready 
to be matched with a Little. Although there is a 
waiting list for Big Sisters who want to be 
matched, there's a list of Little Brothers who 
would like to be matched with Big Brothers. 
Only in recent years have there been cross
gender matches (i.e. Big Sister/Little Brother), 
and according to Akbarian, they are extremely 
rare.
When a Big is matched with a Little, the Big 
meets the Little's parents and gets a chance to 
talk to the Little and see if the match will work. 
For students, part of the match includes making 
sure that the Little doesn't live in an area that 
will be inconvenient for the student, and that the 
student will be able to handle whatever the 
Little is dealing with in his or her life. "[Big 
Brothers & Sisters] does a pretty good job of 
matching," said Akbarian. "They're really spe
cific about it.... The ratio as far as good to bad 
matches is tremendous."

Literacy project cent.
The value of the Center has tangible results; 
the Perry South Senior Center Outdoor Court
yard looks as though it has been conceived, 
designed, and built by professionals, and the 
many printed pages of the teen pregnancy 
booklets are a testament to the effectiveness of 
the program. The future holds even more for the 
program.
The CLC is currently considering a variety of 
new directions. An upcoming HELP project 
involves the creation of a community garden at 
the Union'Avenue Community Center. A new 
version of the WRITE program's Going Places 
booklet is also in the works. This project will 
involve CMU students as writing mentors for 
the high school students. Both groups of stu
dents will interview an adult, probably a CMU 
alumnus, in an established profession. This is an 
opportunity for CMU students to become in

picture of a profession they may be considering.
The CLC is also planning a session for area

lume 86. Issue 7The Tartan. Carnegie Mellon University. Pittsburgh. Pennsylvania21 October'1991Go fly a kite!
By SHARI MORGAN
Tartan Junior Staff writer
Lets go fly a kite/ Up where the air 
is rights Lets go fly a kite/ and send it 
soaring, sings a rejuvenated father in 
the Disney movie Mary Poppins. On 
Saturday, October 26 from llam-3pm 
on The Cut, hopefully everyone else 
will be in a jovial mood as well.
The International Festival Kite Fly
ing Extravaganza, coordinated by Lisa 
Schmidt and Pat Hamed, assistant to 
the dean of Student Affairs, Debbie 
Cherry from Alpha Phi Omega, and 
the International Awareness Commit
tee, is a great opportunity for students 
and faculty alike to come out and par
ticipate in the festivities.
The afternoon activities will include 
a variety of workshops and competi
tions, as well as some plain old fun. A 
professional kite builder will be out on 
the Cut sharing secrets in the fine art 
of kite construction and displaying 
some of his creations. You can take 
whatever you learn here (or maybe 
youll have some secrets of your own!) 
and build your own kite as well. Mate
rials will be provided to build an au
thentic Vietnamese kite. All you need
to supply is a little imagination.
According to Schmidt, These kites 
are easy to put together and are easy 
to fly, assuming we have wind. This 
[the Kite Flying Extravaganza] is for 
all people of all experience levels. There 
will also be ready made kites available 
to use, and anyone who has their own 
kite is welcome to bring it.
In addition to these workshops, there 
will be a kite hospital that will repair 
any kites, should they become in
jured, wounded, or sick during the 
Extravaganza.
Along with the workshops, there will 
be several simple contests. Although 
the coordinators are not exactly sure 
what all of the contests will be, some 
that were mentioned were the most 
colorful, the highest flying, the most 
original, and the kite best represent
ing the theme of Asia and the Interna
tional Festival. Prizes will be awarded 
to the winners.
The organizers of the Kite Flying 
Extravaganza encourage any mem
bers of the campus community to plan 
ahead and bring their own kites,

Be sure to bring your kite to the Cut Saturday. Hopefully, the weather will cooperate and provide sunny skies. In case of rain, 
the Kite Flying Extravaganza will be held on Sunday from 11 am to 3 pm.
Fellow Students:
The much awaited International 
Festival is finally here. It will take 
place this week from October 22-27. 
The Festival will offer numerous inter
esting and exciting activities and 
events, ranging from an education and 
travel abroad fair on Thursday to a 
food fair on Saturday. I am optimistic 
that the Festival will foster a fun filled 
environment, broaden our cultural 
knowledge, and stimulate, our intel
lects.
Various organizations and the Office 
of Student Affairs, particularly Festi
val coordinator Aliya Khan, have de
voted much time and effort to make the 
International Festival a success. Stu
dent Senate has endorsed a resolution 
urging the faculty to seek a balance 
between academics and the Interna
tional Festival this week, using their 
discretion. Faculty Senate, in turn, has
unanimously supported this resolu
tion. Both bodies feel strongly about 
the Festival, and I commend them for 
their support of the International Fes
tival.
However, for the Festival to be suc
cessful, we need students to respond. 
We need you to participate in the Fes
tivalwatch a dance, taste fine Asian 
cuisines, or attend a lecture. What
ever you choose to do, I encourage all 
of you to take advantage of this excel
lent opportunity. The International 
Festival is definitely worth your par
ticipation. I assure you that you will 
find it both enjoyable and informative.
As always, shouldyouhave any ques
tions or comments, please contact me 
at x5391 or e-mail to hsOo. I look 
forward to seeing you at the Interna
tional Festival.

Her outfit is handmade of 
bright orange silk and chiffon. 
Golden threads are embroidered 
into the silk. The top is long and. 
flowing, reaching below the 
knees. Loose pants gathered at 
the ankle and a scarf around the 
neck complete the ensemble. 
Rather elaborate costume to wear 
after your wedding....
On Saturday, October 26, at 5 
pm in the Wherrett Room in 
Skibo, models will parade down 
the runway wearing national 
costumes from all over the Asian 
continent. Over thirty outfits will 
be shown, with origins includ
ing China, Cyprus, Malaysia, 
Taiwan, and Gaudi Arabia. The 
dress feature includes both tra
ditional and modem costumes. 
There will also be attire worn for 
special occasions, such as this 
Pakistani wedding trousseau 
worn by International Festival 
organizer Aliya Khan.
Khans dress is indicative of 
how costumes and clothing play 
a significant role in cultural tra
ditions and attitudes. Wearing 
such ornate clothing after the 
wedding is customary in Paki
stan. When a Pakistani woman 
gets married, she receives a wed
ding trousseau from her family. 
On each day of the week after 
her wedding, she wears a differ
ent outfit from her trousseau.

Huang Xiaopo comments on Chinese alination
By MARK KNAPP
Special to The Tartan
Huang Xiaopo, former Deputy 
Director of the National Press 
Club of China, will present a 
talk and discussion entitled 
Censorship and the Pro Democ
racy Movement in China Tues
day, October 22 from 4:30-7 pm 
in the Skibo Ballroom. She was 
intimately involved at the high
est levels in managing the press 
activities of the Chinese govern
ment. Huang, current studying 
at Princeton University, granted 
The Tartan a short telephone 
interview, a portion of which fol
lows:
Q: Thank you for taking the 
time to speak with The Tartan 
about your upcoming talk at 
CMU. As you know, many 
Americans were moved to tears 
as the events of June 4, 1989, 
flashed across their TV screens. 
Many, I am sure, drew conclu
sions about why this happened 
that only served to deepen preju
dices of China as a backward 
nation. In your mind, are these

Ballroom Tuesday at 4:30 pm.
prejudices justified?
A: I think that we Chinese 
recognize that we are a back
ward country in terms of mod
ernization, development, and the 
level of material civilization in 
comparison with the industrial
ized nations of today. We be
came this way because of the 
degeneration of the authoritar
ian system into a semi-feudal or 
semi-colonial country after the 
Opium Wars. We are very frank 
about it; we are backward in 
terms of material wealth. But 
dont forget China has a glori
ous, long-standing civilization. 
Wehave our pride and dont feel 
backward in culture and tradi
tion. On the other hand, I do 
think there is a deep-rooted 
prejudice, not only towards the 
Chinese,but all Asian andThird 
World peoples, based on a lack 
of understanding and sympathy 
by Americans. The Tiananmen 
Square demonstration, however, 
was the first time the spirit of 
the Chinese people spoke di
rectly to the American people. 
That is a great thing.
Q: Currently, some commen
tators are suggesting China, in 
response to recent world events, 
will turn severely to the left and 
usher in a new Cultural Revo
lution. Having worked in the 
countryside in 1968-70, do you 
have similar fears?
A: You can find a lot of simi
What alienated [China] is the two 
political and ideological systems.
larities with the Maoist period 
in the propaganda and ideologi
cal clichs of the current Chi
nese government. But dont for
get that the chemistry of the 
relation ship of the party and the 
Chinese people has changed in a 
most fundamental way. Now, 
people dont believe the lies. They 
resist not by protest, but by ig
noring it. Life goes on and they 
know its only transitional until 
the old leaders die.
Q: Do you think the Chinese 
governments claims of Ameri
can instigation and involvement 
in the student movement are 
justified?
A: The involvement of the 
Western press, with its cameras 
and TV crews, sent up from time 
to time the tide of the demon
stration. Yes, to some extent ,the 
press did act to encourage the 
protestmovement. Soin the end 
the government blamed the socalled Western or American in
fluence. They said it was the 
American subversion and inter
ference in Chinese domestic af
fairs.
Q: On a different matter, at 
CMU, as with many American 
universities, there are students 
of Chinese descent who come 
from both the Peoples Republic 
of China and Taiwan. Given the 
political realities since 1949, how 
do you suggest these students 
bridge the gap of fear and an
ger they may feel?
A: I think the most important 
thing to bridge the gap is to 
forget ideology. We are all Chi
nese. What has alienated us is 
the two political and ideological 
systems. Its like a cold war 
among the Chinese themselves. 
While the world rejoices in the 
end of the Cold War between the 
Soviet Union and America, we 
Chinese have our own cold war.
We are all victims of this coli_ 
war. We need to focus on our 
commonhistory and culture, 
not ideology.
Q: Finally, why should a per. 
son at CMU come on Tuesday to 
hear you speak?
A: To promote and gain inter, 
national understanding. It s 
fashionable to say we all live in 
a global village, but I dont re. 
ally think so. During my years 
studying and living in the USA, 
it has surprised me how closi 
minded many of the American: 
are. I come here not to lectur; 
you on China or the Chinese 
people; rather, I come to ex
change ideas and experiences 
with the people at CMU to help 
in international understanding. 
I think that is the purpose of! 
your first International F 
val. I come humbly and simply 
for this purpose.

Board and is funded by the Stu
dent Activities Fee. A Chinese

talk.
Booths promise Asian education at a glance
By TRUPTI PATEL
Tartan Staffwriter
One of my friends once mentioned to 
an American that she was from Malay
sia and the person asked her, So, how 
do you like wearing jeans? She was 
amazed that anyone would ask her that. 
I mean, not everybody in Malaysia 
wears jeans, but we all know what they 
are! says Azleena Salleh. Salleh is one 
of many undergraduate students at 
Carnegie Mellon; however, she is one of 
a only a few Malaysian students on 
campus.
This week, Salleh will be represent
ing her homeland in Carnegie Mellons 
long-awaited International Festival. 
Among other things, she plans to help 
run the Malaysian booth for the Asian 
Information Booths Fair on Wednes
day from 12-5 pm.
The Asian Information Booths Fair, 
to be held in the Skibo Ballroom, will 
represent 40 countries in Asia running 
the gamut from Afghanistan to Yemen. 
The 40 countries represented at the 
Booths Fair, which were chosen by the 
International Awareness Committee, 
include some unexpected but interest
ing candidates. For instance, the east
ern portion of the Soviet Union is to be 
represented in the fair. In addition, 
Turkey will be represented.
Aliya Khan, International Festival 
coordinator, says that the International 
Awareness Committee chose to repre
sent places like the eastern Soviet 
Union, Turkey, and Cyprus because, 
Their cultures are very similar to those 
in Asia. They fall very much in the

traditions, crafts, and beliefs. Its nice for 
everybody to know a bit about our country.

theme of Asian cultures, so they were 
included as well.
The purpose of the Information 
Booths Fair is to give people an idea of 
what the countries of Asia are like at a 
glance. Many people are ill-informed 
about even the simplest facts of Asian 
culture; the Booths Fairwillhelp people 
getabetterunderstandingofbasicfacts 
about countries they may have known 
little about.
Each country will have a table in the 
fair and will be identifiable by its name 
and national flag. In addition, the tables 
will offer a variety of pamphlets and 
information cards concerning interest
ing facts and cultural overviews which 
people can take with them. Salleh says 
that her booth will also be surrounded 
by crafts and colorful posters of Malay
sia, so that people can become more 
acquainted with their culture.
According to Salleh, We just want 
the chance to portray our traditions 
and our crafts and beliefs. I hope no
body thinks that we wear sarongs all 
the time and lie around on the beach all 
day. Itsnice for everybody toknowabit 
about our country.
Khan says that the idea to have an 
Information Booths Fair was expressly
for the purpose that Salleh mentioned
 to let people know a little bit about 
each country. When I was speaking 
with DeanMurphy last year, we thought 
of doing the booths. It kind of reminded 
us of Spring Carnival, but we wanted to 
do something a little simpler. And when 
I spoke to students, they were really 
interested, says Khan.
Many Carnegie Mellon students and 
staff members will be running the vari
ous booths to be represented at the 
Information Booths Fair. Khan says, 
Many of them are even bringing back 
things from their countries. Embassies 
in Washington also provided a lot of the 
items that will be available at the 
booths.
Planning for the Booths Fair began 
as early as February of lastyear. Hope
fully, the fair will provide the opportu
nity that Salleh and others have longawaited, to let Americans know what 
far-away lands are really like. Salleh 
says, We like to have fun. Malaysians 
enjoy sharing their cultures with other 
people. And thats exactly what we want 
to do. We want to get rid of some of the ' 
misconceptions some people have about 
Malaysia. Were not just people from 
the jungle.
Traditional dress presents 
clue to cultural knowledge
COSTUMES, from LI
A typical fashion show runway will 
jut from the center of the stage. Seats 
will be positioned in front of and 
around the runway so that the audi
ence can see the intricate details of 
each costume clearly. The show will 
also try to incorporate the countries 
national music in the event.
One of the organizers of the event, 
Lisa Lipscomb, assistant to the dean 
of Student Affairs, tried to ensure 
that the participants in the show also 
played a part in deciding how to run 
it.
We try to incorporate the ideas 
from the models as much as possible. 
[We tried to use] some ideas theyve 
seen from other campuses which have 
done this sort of thing, but we have 
also tried to make the show special 
and unique for our campus.
The purpose of the show is not only 
to entertain with the colorful spec
trum of international costumes, but 
to educate the audience about the 
different cultures being featured. 
Hence, the master of ceremonies will 
be reading a description of each outfit 
as it is modeled on the runway so that 
the audience will know how the spe
cific costume fits into its countrys, 
traditions and customs.
For the final ten minutes of the 
show, the models will come out to 
answer any additional questions the 
audience may have about their cos
tumes.
Lipscomb best states the goal of the 
International Festivals costume 
show. We want to have people walk 
away with the knowledge of why 
people wear what they do, and why 
that is significant.
Hope for sunny skies...

FOR WOMEN ONLY
Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of death among women in the USA. One of every nine 
American women will develop breast cancer during her lifetime.
Factors that increase a womens risk for breast cancer are; a positive family history in a mother or a 
sister, menstruation at an early age, late menopause, childlessness, first pregnancy after age 30, 
radiation exposure, a high fat diet, obesity and moderate or greater alcohol consumption.
If detected early, breast cancer has an excellent chance for cure. That is why monthly self-breast 
exams are so important.
In addition to self examination, you should see your health care provider for a routine check-up, 
including a breast exam, at least once a year.
Self Breast Examination (cut out and tape to bathroom mirror)
Breast self exams should be performed at the same time each month. The best time is 3 or 4 days 
after the monthly period has ended, when the breasts are least tender and swollen. If you are taking 
birth control pills you should examine your breasts on the day you start your new pack of pills.
-Begin the exam by standing before a mirror and inspecting 
the breasts with arms at your sides and then over your head.
Then place your hands on your hips and tighten your chest 
and arm muscles. Observe for any asymmetry of the 
breasts, masses, or dimpling of skin.
-The remainder of the exam can be performed in the bath or 
shower or while lying down on your back. Place your right 
hand behind your head. With your left hand move the pads 
of your fingers over the entire right breast in small circular 
motions beginning at the outer most portion of your breast 
and making circles inward towards the nipple. Be sure and 
examine all portions of your breast including the armpit and 
nipple. Gently squeeze the nipple to see if any fluid comes 
out. Repeat the procedure for the other breast.
Most lumps will be non-cancerous, however, see your health care provider for any lumps 
that last over a month or for any nipple discharge.
A monthly breast self examination should be a lifetime habit as it is one of the best ways to 
screen for the early stages of breast cancer.

This is an example of a portion of a Go board. If Black had the next turn, a piece

next turn, a stone here would strengthen Whites border, making it impossible to 
capture.
Tartan Lounge, beginning with regis
tration at 9:30 am on Saturday. All are 
invited, especially beginners. The tour
nament should not take up all of the 
players time, so the players will be able 
to enjoy the rest of the Festival.
Players in the tournament will play 
three rounds on Saturday and two
rounds on Sunday. The tournament is 
not elimination, so all players will be 
able to play all five games. Also, in 
order to account for the different 
strengths of the players involved, the 
tournament will be divided into divi
sions and handicapped, which gives all 
players a good chance of winning the 
tournament. The divisions will be set 
at the tournament depending on the 
strengths of the players involved. They 
will ensure that each player will play 
others of approximately the same 
strength.
Besides the tournament, a simulta
neous exhibition will be held by Jing 
Yang, a strong local player who studied 
Go under Nie Wie Ping in China, one of 
the strongest players in the world. The 
exhibition will take place at 7 pm Sat
urday evening, and is open to up to 
twenty players, depending on demand. 
The exhibition is open to all.
Go is an Asian game of strategy in 
which two players, one playing white 
stones and the other black stones, at
tempt to control territory on a 19x19 
grid which serves as the board. The 
players alternate moves by placing a 
single stone on one of the 361 intersec
tions of the lines. Go has a complicated 
tactical element as well. If one player 
surrounds some of his opponents 
stones, the player captures those stones 
and uses them to reduce his opponents 
territory at the end of the game. The 
player with the most territoiy at the 
end wins.
Usually the game is timed, as will be 
the case at the International Festival 
tournament. For this particular tour
Go is very simple to learn ... while the 
interaction between the pieces can become 
complicated.
nament, each player will have one hour 
to complete all their moves, although if 
a player runs out of time the game will 
continue with the player beingforced to 
complete 15 moves in five minutes for 
the remainder of the game. Fred 
Hansen, the Go Club sponsor at CMU, 
summed up the general strategy as 
Some players are better at finding the 
right intersection than others. The 
former generally wins tournaments.
Go is very simple to learn, as the 
pieces all have the same properties and 
the object is simple. However the inter
action betweejn the pieces can become 
very complicated, and this makes the 
game interesting. The handicap sys
tem used in Go alio ws the weaker player 
to place several stones on the board 
before his opponent is allowed his first 
move. This system is very good in that 
it can equalize fairly vast differences in 
playing strengths. Since this system 
will be in effect at the tournament, all 
players should have a good chance to 
win some games.
Go associations throughout the world 
employ a rating system which ranks 
players from amateur (kyu) to master 
(dan) status. The handicaps employed 
at the tournament are based on these 
ratings. The International Festival 
tournament will use these ratings, al
though it is not necessary to have a 
rating in order to play. All players will 
gain a rating in the course of the tour
nament.
Go is at least several thousand years 
old, andis described in legends as being 
required knowledge of ancient Chinese 
generals. Currently, Go is extremely 
popular in Asia, where it is often car
ried by television stations to large audi
ences. The most watched program last 
year in Korea was a Go match between 
the Korean champion and a strong Japa
nese player. Newspapers also carry Go 
columns, giving updates on various 
tournaments and matches throughout 
the world. Newspapers are also pri
mary sponsors of Go tournaments 
throughout Asia, providing prizes for 
the players who compete.
The CMU Go Club hosts play ers from 
throughout Pittsburgh at its meetings, 
and has players from many surround
ing states attend its tournaments. The 
club contains players of all strengths, 
rangingfrom complete beginners to very

Artisans show off special skills, offer unique crafts, art works

On October 25, an Arts and 
Crafts Fair will feature the 
unique artifacts, jewelry, and 
clothing of Asia in a sprawling 
Asian Bazaar atmosphere. Held 
in the Ballroom, Grey Matter, 
the Faculty Lounge, and the 
Wherrett Room in Skibo from 
12-5 pm, the Fair will allow 
Students to shop and wander 
through the cultures and artistries of the Asian continent in 
action as artisans demonstrate 
the artistic process in action, 
from hand painting to flower 
arrangement.
Several special exhibits and 
booths will be highlighted 
throughout the day. Chinese 
paper cutter Hou-Tien Cheng 
will perform his ancient art from 
noon to 4:30 pm in the Skibo 
Ballroom. Paper cutting means 
window flowers in Chinese. 
The cutter deftly shapes a de
sign from one sheet of paper,
Several special exhibits and booths 
will be highlighted throughout the 
day.... the Arts and Crafts Fair 
promises to be one of the best.
much as one would a set of paper 
dolls. The finished pieces are far 
more elaborate, however. Cheng 
takes requests from the audi
ence, and has been known to cut 
everything and anything from 
Mickey Mouse to trailing el
ephants, making art with just a 
scrap of paper and pair of scis
sors.
From 12-2 pm, Teruko 
Taniguchi and Masayo Hobo 
from the Japan Society of 
Greater Pittsburgh will perform 
the traditional Japanese tea cer
emony, or Cha-no-yu, in kimono
dress in the Faculty Lounge. The 
ceremony uses a special tea 
called matcha, and mixes the 
tea with waterin the chawan, or 
cup. This ceremony will be fol
lowed by a calligraphy segment, 
or sho, performed by calligra
pher Teruko Shiono. The two 
demonstrations will berepeated 
several times throughout the 
two-hour time frame.
Also from 12-2 pm, the Japa
nese language students will 
demonstrate the art of origami, 
or paper-folding, in Grey Mat
ter. This art is actually derived
from a childrens game which 
forms birds and other figures 
from colored paper without us
ing scissors or paste.
Grey Matter also hosts dem
onstrations of the Indian art of 
henna hand painting, which is a 
traditional decoration of the 
hand with flowers and other or
nate designs during this time as 
well.
Perhaps the highlight of the 
day will be Harold Sasaharas 
presentation ofIkebana, or Japa
nese flower arrangement in the 
Wherrett Room from 2-3:30 pm. 
Displayed in a nageirebana 
(vase) or moribana (plate), flow
ers and other articles are deli
cately placed according to strict 
rules in a uniquely Japanese 
fashion.
A graduate of the renowned 
Ikenobo Institute of Ikebana, 
Sasahara was invited in 1983 to 
Tokyo to accept the Decoration 
of the Sixth Class of the Sacred 
Treasure from the Emperor and 
government of Japan. Now re
siding in Pittsburgh, he teaches 
this difficult art in area classes 
and provides demonstrations to 
interested groups.
Accentingtheintemational at
mosphere of the building will be 
Hmong tapestries created by 
Laotian artist Bo Vu. Less pro
fessional but certainly no less 
appreciated, the children from 
Morewood Gardens Daycare 
Center will display their fish 
prints and a handmade oriental 
dragon.
Not to be forgotten, vendors 
canbefound throughoutthe area 
selling and demonstrating their 
own particular skills. There will 
also be donated student displays 
of crafts and artwork discovered 
on their personal journeys 
abroad.
Aliya Khan, this years coordi
nator of the International Festi
val, while believing all of this 
weeks activities will be excit
ing, assures that the Arts and 
Crafts Fair promises to be one 
of the best.

Coffee hour focuses on cultures
By MARNI BLAKE
Tartan Staffwriter
The Modern Languages De
partment and the International 
Festival Committee will co-sponsor the International Coffee 
Hour on October 24, in the fac
ulty lounge in Skibo from 4-5:30 
pm. The coffee hour will be an 
ideal opportunity to sit back, 
relax, and experience a little bit 
of a different culture as well as 
share a little of your own.
The coffee hour has several 
goals, from sharing and recog
nizing cultural uniqueness to 
providing opportunities for the 
campus community to listen and/ 
or participate in Asian language 
discussions.
The idea is to bring people
together who want to speak other 
languages andleam aboutother 
cultures, says senior lecturer 
Susan Polanski of the Modem 
Languages Department. Partici
pants will have plenty of oppor
tunities to mingle and find 
people who speak languages 
other than English. In the past, 
similar coffee hours have in
cluded people from a wide vari
ety of backgrounds and beliefs, 
as well as a cross section of stu
dents, faculty, and staff.
While visitors are chatting in 
this multilingual setting, they 
will also have the unique oppor
tunity to experience a central 
part of Japanese culture  the 
Japanese tea ceremony. The 
authentic staging of the tea cer
emony includes a special set-up
and the presentation of specific 
foods in ritual. To add to the 
authenticity to the event, the 
demonstrators will be dressed 
in kimonos and other examples 
of Japanese dress.
Asian eoffees, teas, and sweets 
will be an integral part of this 
cultural experience. Tea is an 
essential piece of Asian cultures 
and will be readily available at 
the coffeehour; coffeesfrom Asia 
Minor will be served. The coffee 
hour will also provide walnut 
and fortune cookies.
Whether learning about a dif
ferent culture or sharing your 
own experiences, the Interna
tional Coffee Hour should be an 
enjoyable, delicious, and enlight
ening experience for all. Stop by 
and check it out.

Eat your way throughout Asia
pining Service . local restaurants shares multicultural dishes
By BOB DIXON
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
You can visit at least five different 
regions of the world in five days without 
spending more than four dollars.
Well, maybe not visit, but you can 
taste the cuisine of five Asian regions 
this week, courtesy of Carnegie Mellon 
pining Service and the International 
Festival.
Beginning today, Dining Service will 
serve a selection of ethnic Asian foods 
in the Highlander Cafe, Morewood 
Gardens, and Salads Plus in honor of 
this years International Festival. Each 
day will feature a different region of 
Asia. Today spotlights food from the 
Middle East. For the remainder of the 
week, dishes from the Philippines, In
dia, China, and Japan will be high
lighted.
On each of these days, local ethnic 
restaurants will be aiding Dining Ser
vice in preparing the days meals. Dur
ing the week, students may pick up 
passports at any of the participating 
dining facilities and enter to win a $25 
gift certificate for any one of several
Asian restaurants.
To complete the week, an interna
tional food festival will be held Satur
day from noon to 4:30 pm in the Skibo 
Ballroom. All five regions will be fea
tured by local restaurant vendors, in
cluding Jemila, La Filipiniana Teody, 
Coral Garden, Yum Wok, and Taste of 
India. During the food festival on Sat
urday, food will be available from each 
vendor and items should not cost more 
than $3-$4 per meal.
Along with the food centered events, 
many programs throughout the week of 
the International Festival will include 
receptions or buffets comprised of ethnic 
foods. Most of the programs will provide 
free food indigenous to the area that is 
the topic of the event.
The food festival was one of the first 
events planned when the process of 
designing the International Festival 
began in March, 1991. Most of the res
taurants in the city that serve Asian 
dishes were contacted about being part 
of the Festival through letters and tele
phone calls.
Out of a list of approximately 20 
establishments that were picked be
cause of authenticity, five responded.
Restaurants which responded did so 
for the opportunity to teach methods of 
preparing authentic ethnic dishes. 
Other factors included having the staff 
to send to Carnegie Mellon for the 
Festival and being able to coordinate 
with Dining Service to provide authen
tic cuisine.
Many cultures express themselves 
through their foods, said Aliya Khan, 
coordinator of the International Festi
val. Khan said that primary concerns 
in choosing establishments to take part 
in the Festival were their attention to 
authenticity and the recommendations 
of those familiar with the restaurants 
and the food served.
The purpose of such a wide variety of 
food is to enhance each event [and] get 
a taste of [each] culture. While stu
dents will come anyway, Khan admits 
that food is a strategy to some extent 
to attract more attention to certain 
events and aid in movingpeople through 
areas which need to be cleaned or rear
ranged before the next event.
Food in Dining Service facilities will 
be available through regular meal con
tracts; however, Saturdays food festi
val will be a la carte.
Folk theater highlights local talent
ByAMYPOTTHAST
Tartan Asst. Diversions Editor
The Pittsburgh International 
Folk Theatre will perform on 
October 24 from 7:30-8:30 pm 
in the Skibo Ballroom, showcas
ing local talent in an exciting 
performance of folk songs and 
dances unique to the cultures 
and ethnicities of Asia.
The Pittsburgh International 
Folk Theatre formed at 
Duquesne University in 1987. 
Since then, theyve left 
Duquesne and have toured
throughout the United States. 
Director/Emcee Walter Kolar 
and his group have performed 
folk arts from Europe, Asia, and 
Africa. Thursday, the Folk The
atre will perform fourteen songs 
and dances from Asia. The 
groups members represent eight 
different countries and will per
form from a cross section of ten 
Asian countries.
International Festival coordi
nator Aliya Kahn emphasized 
the importance of experiencing 
artistic traditions of other coun
tries. Music and dance are a
vital part of life in Asian coun
tries as well as in America.... 
Seeing arts of foreign countries 
is a fun way to understand their 
cultures. In literature and reli
gion it is often difficult to really 
understand the [spirit] of the 
cultures, but music and dance 
are universal, she said.
You wont have to travel very 
far to experience the folk tradi
tions of Asia, so take advantage 
of this unique opportunity to 
envelop yourself in the songs 
and dances of the International 
Folk Theatre.

As part of this weeks Inter
national Festival, interna
tionally acclaimed Odissi 
dancer Oopali Operajita will 
perform her classical Indian 
dance in the Skibo Ballroom.
Operajita, a research fel
low at Carnegie Mellons Stu
dio for Creative Inquiry, has 
been fascinated with dance 
from an early age. She rel
ished the music and rhythm 
of it, and learned from the 
South Indian Bharata Natyat. 
By the time she was seven, 
she was dazzling interna
tional audiences with her gift 
ofmovement. By 14, Operajita 
chose to specialize in the 
Odissi, a dance of prayer in 
the Hindu temple ritual. To
day, she tours not only in the 
United States, but through
out Europe and Asia.
The Odissi, with its mood, 
melody, and rhythm, is per
haps the most subtle form of 
alllndian dance styles. Fluid 
and graceful, the elegant 
dance represents the mystery 
; and charm of the East. An 
important part of temple life,
! pair.tings of Odissi dancers 
i grace the walls of both the ' 
Rajarani and Mukteshwar 
temples in India, and in the 
famous sun temple of 
Konoiak.

choreographs. On Wednesday

FOR MEN ONLY
Testicular cancer is of the leading causes of cancer in males between 15 and 35 years of age. It is a 
relatively rare cancer and the etiology is unknown. The incidence in young men is approximately 23 in 
100,000 males.
There is an increased risk of developing testicular cancer in an individual with a history of an unde
scended testicle or an inquinal hernia in childhood.
If testicular cancer is detected early, it is almost 100% curable. That is why testicular self-examina
tions are so important.
*Testicular self-examination (cut out and tape on bathroom mirror)
- Examine your testicles at least once a month while you are in the shower.
- Roll each testicle between the thumb and first three fingers until the entire surface has been covered. 
The testides should feel round and smooth, like hard-boiled eggs.
- Be on the lookout for lumps, irregularities, a change in the size of the testicle, pain in the testicle, or a 
dragging sensation. All of these are possible signs of a tumor. If you find any of them, consult your 
health care provider at once. Remember, you need to examine only the testicles themselves, not the 
sperm tubes or blood vessels that are also in the scrotum.
- Pick a regular day of the month that is easy to remember to examine your testicles . Do the 
examination more frequently if you prefer.
Testicular cancer is a rare killer of young men. But when it takes so very little to protect yourself - just 
half a minute a month - it makes sense to do this simple examination.

Yo! CMDS raps!
CMDS worker signs record deal to rap withD.J.Kid Flash
By MARNIBOREK
Tartan Asst. Diversions Editor
Popular mainstream club 
music has changed enormously 
over the last two decades. In the 
70s, disco crowds found them
selves boogeying to Donna 
Summer and Blondie.
In the 80s, club dancers 
whirled, gyrated, and moonwalked to the sounds of Prince, 
Madonna, Duran Duran, and 
Michael Jackson.
Now theres a new genre of 
music setting the beat in night
clubs around the world, with the 
help of such musical groups as 
C&C Music Factory, Heavy D 
and the Boyz, and Marky Mark 
and the Funky Bunch its hip 
hop/rap. And from amidst the 
Carnegie Mellon community 
arises a musician who is a sign 
of the times. Dining service em
ployee Walt Cusick, also known 
as W.C. Ill, will soon hit the hip 
hop/rap scene with his partner 
D.J. Kid Flash.
Cusick, originally from Roch
ester New York, attended Mer
cer College in Erie, Pennsylva
nia on a basketball scholarship. 
He graduated with a degree in 
Hotel and Restaurant Manage
ment and was given a job by the 
Marriott Corporation. He works 
as a manager of the Carte Cafe, 
which is located in CMUs Wean 
Hall. It was during his college
years that he started writing 
the songs that would later be the 
key to the beginning of his ca
reer as a musician.
I wanted to play basketball. I 
wanted to go pro someday after 
college, but that didnt work out, 
says Cusick. I started writing 
songs about two years ago and I 
finally got into the studio about 
ayear ago with my partner [D.J. 
Kid Flash]. Before we knew it, 
we were playing the clubs.
Cusick hooked up with D.J. 
Kid Flash two summers ago. D.J. 
Kid Flash gave him the opportu
nity to observe such groups as 
Kid 'N Play, Public Enemy, and 
Heavy D at work. D.J. Kid Flash 
is already an established name 
in the hip hop/rap world. He 
worked with Kid TST Play for 
three years and is a popular ra
dio deejay in Buffalo and Ro
chester.
Right now, W.C. Ill and D.J. 
Kid Flash are under the Astron 
Music Publishing label. Astron 
is a publishing company that 
helps music groups sign with 
major record companies. The 
group is looking at such labels 
asTommy Boy, which represents 
groups like De La Soul and Pub
lic Enemy.
Were at the high-quality 
demo tape level right now. 
Within a month the production 
tape will be done and well search 
for a record label, says Cusick.
In a month or so we hope to do 
shows at places like Metropol 
and Confetti. Things are going 
to happen real quick.
Like most other hip hop/rap 
groups, W.C. Ill and D.J. Kid 
Flashs music possesses a driv
ing beatwith some samplingand 
powerful bass. Cusick has pro
duced such songs as Girl,You 
Caught My Eye, a realistic view 
of asking that special someone 
out for the first time; College 
Life, a depiction of the hang
overs, one night stands, and 
other fun activities university 
living has to offer; and Bubble 
Gum, Bubble Gum, a fantasy 
about taking a girl to a faraway 
island.
Besides just focusing on how 
much the music will get danc
ers feet stomping, the duos 
songwriter Cusick focuses on 
getting a lesson he learned on 
the basketball court back in 
Rochester across tohis audience
 its time to end racism.
Basketball was the key tool 
in my writing. I was from a de
cent area, but I learned to play 
basketball in the ghetto and saw 
a different environment from the 
inside, says Cusick. Through 
my music what Im trying to do 
is make people aware that rac
ism should come to an end. 
People should start judging 
people for who they arenot by 
the color of their skin. Harmonys
oGhw icay nanuii musib ruuuaiuiig

the message.
In order to drive the anti-rac
ism idea home, Cusick has 
planned a symbolic and exciting 
dance accompaniment for his 
music.
I want my performers to be 
black and white. I thought it 
would be interesting to have 
them come out onto the stage 
with Klan hats on to show racial
tension and then show them get 
rid of their prejudices, says 
Cusick.
Although white rappers such 
as Vanilla Ice have not gained 
much respect in the hip hop/rap 
community, Cusick feels that his 
color will not force him to face 
the same problems.
uIf you have good music, it 
shouldnt matter what color you
are. Vanilla Ice was insecure 
and needed a false identity by 
saying he was from the ghetto. 
Im not from the ghetto, says 
Cusick. People are sheltered in 
their own environment. People 
usually dont leave their inner 
city or suburban environment, 
but they should remember some
thing  people are the same 
wherever they go.
Intellect and emotion collide 
in Fosters Little Man Tate
By WASEEM HUSSAIN
Tartan Senior Staffwriter
Little Man Tate marks the directorial 
debut of bourgeois favorite Jodie Fos
ter. The premise of the film is ambigu
ous and this fundamental deficiency is 
what weakens the film. What if a bril
liant boy of seven joins a program for 
gifted youngsters? Who cares? The film 
is clearly character driven. The plot is 
secondary to his development within 
the program. But the canvas upon which 
their portraits are painted is simply too 
weak to allow even the characters to 
grow.
Lets examine the cast of characters. 
At the center of the film is Fred Tate, 
boy genius. He is a charming boy whose 
intelligence makes him feel as though 
hes an outcast among his peers. For 
him knowledge is a curse as well as a

and starring Jodie Foster.
blessing. This is a child who suffers 
from ulcers : a result of his anxietyridden young life. He worries about the 
hole in the ozone, about famine, and 
other world problems.
This is one of the interesting internal 
conflicts that are planted early on in 
the film but never quite resolved. Some 
questions have no answers, but it would 
have been fascinating to know how one 
should resolve the problem of knowing 
too much.
Then theres Freds mom Dede Tate, 
played by Jodie Foster. She is a hard
working waitress whose deep, uncondi
tional love for her son shapes the boy 
and ultimately holds the key to his 
salvation. She is a constant in Freds 
life. When she is faced with the propo
sition of sending Fred away lo school 
for gifted youngsters, the film reaches 
its first point of tension. Can Dede let 
go of her little boy or not? She loves the 
boy too much to let her motherly in
stincts stunt his intellectual growth 
and hands the boy over to the head of 
the school, Jane Grierson.
Grierson, deftly played by Dianne 
Wiest, is perhaps the most interesting 
character of the films three main char
acters. Grieson is a wealthy, educated, 
lonely woman seeking fulfillment. Her 
life consists of the school for brilliant

Phoenix Dance Company heats up the Fulton Theater
By MARY YEE
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
Opening night for the Phoenix 
Dance Company this past Saturday night was spectacular. 
The dance group sold out every 
seat in the newly-renovated 
Fulton Theater, wowing audi
ences with their exciting and 
graceful movements. What more 
could a brilliant, talented group 
from Leeds, England want?

only did he play with sexuality, 
but he also added a country west
ern spice with cowboy hats, 
boots, and body gear. His focus 
on romantic couples in this piece, 
which involved the dancers swift 
control movements, was spec
tacular.
Jobes ingenuity in creating 
the broken hearts scene with a 
twist produced laughter from the 
audience. The four dancers rep
resenting hearts were brightly 
clothed and moved well across 
the stage.
There was also the disco ball 
in the scene accented by purple 
and red star lights in the back
ground. This attracted the 
audiences attention to the quick, 
intense yet free movements of 
the dancer on stage with the 
song Im Down to My Last Ciga
rette.
One of the most challenging 
pieces featured in the program 
was Sacred Space. Choreo

graphed by Philip Taylor, it in
volved nine out of the ten mem
bers of the company. These danc
ers included Clare Connor, 
Stephen Derrick, Chantal 
Donaldson, Dawn Donaldson, 
Richard Goodison, Pamela John
son, Brooker T. Louis, Martin 
Robinsin, and Seline Thomas.
Sacred Space integrated the 
many changes our society has 
endured. The dancers symboli
cally showed that despite all the 
setbacks our society has had, we 
are still able to survive. Through
out the scene, the dancers con
stant movements to the beat and 
rhythm of the music emphasized
the spontaneity and changes in 
our urban lives. Darkness, which 
fused the complexity and confu
sion we are exposed to in our 
lives, close this piece.
At the onset of the piece, there 
was only the silence and move
ment of the dancers. When the 
music began, the dancers moved
with ease, control, agility, and 
swiftness. The music enthralled 
the audience, yet it also brought 
with it an air of confusion. Move
ments were spontaneous, but 
there was definitely a lot of sup
port involved.
TaintedLove, an earlier work 
of choreographer Jobe, inte
grated modern dance and club 
music to show the AIDS prob
lem in our society. Black-andred colored costumes, dark sun
glasses, and red scarf masks rep
resented the dangers of the dis
ease. The dancers masked faces 
and fast-paced movements con
veyed the mystery of the AIDS 
virus.
At the end of the four pieces, 
there was a fifteen minute Meet 
the Artist Conference with Tom 
Jobe. Jobe talked of the origins 
of the dance company and cho
reographic techniques. He ex
plained that the Phoenix Dance 
Company was an all-male group 
when it was created ten years 
ago, but has now added female 
dancers to the group. The group 
was trained in Graham tech
nique.

Roseanne offers more than insulting remarks about life
Last week the most popular 
showin the nation wasnt Cheers, 
Cosby, or Murphy Brown ... it 
was Roseanne. Over the past 
few seasons, this show has qui
etly entertained a loyal (and still 
growing) audience. It has man
aged to overcome a lot of inter
nal problems, not to mention the 
bad publicity stunts pulled by 
its star (two words: National 
Anthem). 
Why do viewers keep coming 
back? The reason is simple: this 
is a damn good show  one of 
the best on television. I think it 
is the program I have the most 
respect for, because it deals with 
all sorts of issues realistically 
and intelligently, while still 
managing to be funny.
Look how Roseanne has 
handled these concerns:
Work. The Conners are not 
rich. They are not successful. 
Roseanne has been through at 
least four jobs since the begin
ning of the series, while hus
band Dan seems to be unem
ployed most of the time.
Work is a necessity. Roseannes paychecks put food on 
the table, but they dont offer 
her much more. Shes never had 
ajob shereally loved; family has 
always come first. Inevitably, 
the work she dislikes takes up 
much more of her time and en
ergy than the family she does 
like. Its the catch-22 of the work
ing class, and Roseanne captures 
its essence better than anything 
else on the tube.
THE LAUGH TRACK
TH , .oAB-PaB FrrPro
Sex. Never has a sitcom 
handled the issue of teenage sex 
as straightforwardly and realis
tically as Roseanne. Last sea
son, Roseanne and Dan came 
home to find younger daughter 
Darlene, a sworn tomboy, writh
ing on the sofa with her study 
partner. Dan was.furious, but it 
turned out that Darlene was 
more confused than anything 
else. While Roseanne tried to 
offer advice and support, 
Darlene was too embarrassed to 
accept it.
On other sitcoms, goofy boys 
and giggly girls do nothing but 
plan conquests of each other 
(usually, of course, with no re
sult). Darlenes first intimate 
experience with the opposite sex 
was unplanned, awkward, and 
almost accidental  it was real.
This seasonspremierefocused 
on Beckys desire to use birth 
control. She talked to her mother 
about it, and, in the end, 
Roseanne finally admitted that 
if her daughter was going to be 
sexually active, she should at 
least use birth control. Roseanne 
was comfortable with the deci
sion she made; she allowed 
Becky her freedom and still kept 
her trust. But she was also still 
a mother.
PullingBecky aside, Roseanne 
then asked her if there was any
thing she wanted to talk about 
before having sex for the first 
time. Becky stammers for a few 
seconds before saying quietly 
that her desire for birth control 
now does not mean that she has 
not had sex before.
In other words, a teenage char
acter on a sitcom has lost her 
virginity  and we missed it! 
The viewers were not treated to 
along, drawn-out, romanticized 
dramatization of the first time 
(see Doogie Howser). On The 
CosbyShow, this storyline would 
be good for at least a couple of 
episodes; on Growing Pains, 
where wild and crazy Mike 
seems to be saving himself for 
marriage, this storyline could 
last a couple of seasons. Here, 
though, its dropped in at the 
end of the episode, almost as an 
afterthought.
Roseanne, of course, missed 
it, too. She is a bit shocked, even 
speechless for a moment. But 
then she takes a deep breath 
and gives her daughter a hug. 
The next week, none of it is even 
mentioned. Life goes on.
Sexual preference. Roseannes current boss is gay. While 
this development has received a 
lot of press, its only been men
tioned once or twice on the pro
gram. Leon is not a gay man, he
On other sitcoms, goofy boys and giggly girls do nothing 
but plan conquests of each other (usually, of course, 
with no result). Darlene's first intimate experience with 
the opposite sex was unplanned, awkward, and almost 
accidental  it was real.
is a man who is gay. His gayness 
is not his defining characteris
tic.
So far, the main characters 
have taken this in stride. Leon 
comes out to Dan and his bud
dies at a poker game. Leon is 
asked if he would have sex with 
Melanie Griffith if she wanted 
him. He answers honestly: no. 
Didnt Roseanne tell you I was 
gay? he asks.
Dead silence for several sec
onds, as the guys look around 
frantically, wondering how to 
handle this unexpected intru
sion into their (heterosexual) 
male bonding ritual.
Finally, one of Dans friends 
breaks the silence. All right, 
then, he says, how about Andy 
Griffith? Everybody laughs, and 
the awkwardness is quickly for
gotten.
Life. The Conners yell. The 
Conners complain. The Conners 
insult each other. A lot. Some
times deeply. Sarcasm rules su
preme in this household; any
one not ready with a snappy 
retort will simply not survive.
Yet, with all this commotion,
the love the Conners feel for 
each other is eminently appar
ent. Its not verbally expressed; 
its a feeling. Roseanne can say 
I hate you and mean I love 
you. Dan can say Geez, you 
stink and mean Never go 
away. The Conners realize what 
other sitcom families apparently 
havent: love is too big for words. 
Its a look or a gesture, or simply 
being there when someone needs 
you. In Roseanne, this love is 
everywhere.
The characters on Roseanne 
are able to take things in stride, 
overcome hardships, and get on 
with living. Dont let the con
stant insults fool you; on 
Roseanne, everyone gets a 
chance to be accepted.
Who do we have to thank for 
this wonderful half-hour? One 
person: Roseanne Arnold (nee 
Barr). She is the star and execu
tive producer (she got the old 
one fired). She has final say over 
everything that appears on 
screen. Its her show, no doubt 
about it.
But its more than that; its 
also her. In a way, she is
Roseanne Conner, or at least a 
part of her (or wants to be). It is 
obvious that theres a real person behind this show because, 
more than anything else, 
Roseanne is real. Roseanne isnt 
escapist; its a reflection of life. 
The characters arent people we 
want to know, they are people 
we do know.
Yes, yes, Roseanne Arnold is 
rude and obnoxious. She and 
her husband Tom Arnold try 
their darndest to disgust as 
many people as possible on a 
regular basis.
As far as Im concerned, 
though, Roseanne can dance 
naked on the flag while playing 
America the Beautiful on the 
kazoo if she wants to. That 
doesnt matter to me. Every 
week, she turns out a half-hour 
of entertaining and moving tele
vision by putting herself on dis
play. For that, she will always 
have my respect and admira
tion.

Flying Pig soars into the Wherrett Room
ByAMYPOTTHAST
Tartan Asst. Diversions Editor
As the theater world grows 
and changes, it needs people  
the young, energetic, talented 
kind  to facilitate its growth 
and change. To meet this need, a 
group of Carnegie Mellon-affiliated people, both recent alumni 
and current students, have en
thusiastically volunteered to 
spend their time nurturing a 
relatively new theater company, 
the Flying Pig Theatre.
Founded in the summer of 
1990 by CMU alumni Jessie 
Ramey and Tamar Copeland, the 
Flying Pig Theatre has already 
made great strides in establishingthemselves in the Pittsburgh 
community. With twelve mem
bers, four of whom are still stu
dents here, the Flying Pig The
atre performs regularly at the 
Artery (an art gallery and eat
ery), and the Birmingham Loft. 
Because the company has do
nated a number of performances 
to benefit Pittsburghs Commu
nity Outreach program, Chris
topher Rawson of the Pittsburgh 
Post-Gazette has named them 
the Most Helpful New Theatre
Performance Preview
REALITY OPTIONAL. Tonight in 
the Wherrett Room at 8 pm. Ad
mission is free.
Company in Pittsburgh.
The theater company is cur
rently soaring to new heights, 
preparing for the inaugural sea
son of the Pittsburgh New Works 
Festival. The Festival will show
case ten brand new plays writ
ten by Pittsburgh playwrights, 
which-will be performed by nine 
local theater companies. The 
Flying Pig Theatres contribu
tion to the Festival is Deadman 
Walking written, coincidentally, 
by yet another Carnegie Mellon 
graduate Tammy Ryan. Dead
man Walking will open on Hal
loween.
In addition to their presenta
tion of newly scripted plays, the 
theater company is also com
mitted to its resident improvisa
tion troupe, Reality Optional. 
Reality Optional completely 
makes up the entire show on the 
spot, based on audience sugges
tions, explains Jessie Ramey, 
the general manager of the com
pany.
We have a bunch of ... vi
gnettes ... that have a structure 
and we get an audience sugges
tion and plug it into that struc
ture. So when the actors come 
onstage they know where the 
scene is going to go, but they 
have know idea what words 
theyre going to say to get them 
there.
One segment of a Reality Op
tional show is called Poets Cor
ner. Three actors ask the audi
ence for something that hap
pened to them that day, then the 
actors make up poems, off the 
top of their heads, dealing with 
an audience members experi
ence.
Because of its unplanned na
ture, improvisation is sometimes 
a tricky art to gauge.
Audience reaction is always 
different, Ramey says. An au
dience will love something, and 
the director will hate it, or the 
audience might not respond and 
[well] be absolutely dying and 
holding our sides with laugh
ter.
But theyve always satisfied 
their audiences. With biweekly 
appearances at the Artery, Re
ality Optional is quickly build
ing a following.
We have the place packed 
every show... and with our Fre
quent Flyer discounts [for all 
the Flying Pig Fans], we can tell 
that a lot of people are returning 
for more, says Ramey.
The kind of creativity and 
spontaneity needed to go out 
onstage and make up coherent 
and entertaining stories and 
songs is a task tough to imagine. 
To work together as a well-oiled 
machine, so to speak, the com
pany needs a strong rapport off
stage as well as on. In this re-* 
gard, Reality Optional is also 
successful. Ramey explains, We 
have a tight group. Were all 
friends  maybe not best 
friends, but friends. Weve 
learned to trust each other so we 
know what to expect from each 
other when we get onstage.
To see performances of Real
ity Optional and the Flying Pig 
Theatre, stop by the Wherrett 
Room tonight at 8, where Real
ity Optional will perform for the 
Carnegie Mellon community.

These dancers (the Phoenix

inspired me to come back to the 
artistic scene. When I saw them, 
I remembered the excitement of 
dancing, which I had lost for a 
while. I didnt get to dance pro
fessional contemporary dance 
with rhythmic and exciting mu
sic, but now I still have the 
chance to create it. I try to create 
pieces that are fun, but they 
may also be serious. I try to
inject my sense of humor to 
complement the dance, even if it 
may be serious, such as the 
Tainted Love work. I was in

TATE, from page L13
youngsters and a writing career 
based on the exploits of these 
children. The struggle for pos
session of Fred between Dede 
and Jane is the focus of the film. 
Who will win this struggle? Will 
Fred choose intellectual fulfill
ment over spiritual fulfillment? 
The answer to these question is 
the basis of Little Man Tate.
Though the film fails from a 
story point of view, it does suc
ceed in delivering emotional jabs 
thatkeep thefilm alive. At times, 
Fred Tate looks like a little Mr. 
Spock, skillfully moving his im
posing eyebrows to convey the 
emotion of the moment. His 
witty, sharp dialogue spices up 
the film and keeps it moving.
This is a character the audi
ence will enjoy watching. He 
doesnt come off as being feeble
or obnoxious. Instead, he is quite 
charming and loveable. Watch
ing him be brilliant is sort of 
interesting and is a source of 
entertainment in a film that 
sometimes is very short on that 
all-important resource.
When Fred is upset and afraid, 
his mother comforts and soothes 
his fragile psyche. These mo
ments of mother-son interaction 
are very moving and clearly are 
the scenes in which Fosters film 
is the strongest. When he can
not sleep, mother and son lie in 
the darkness playing a shadow 
game in which Fred gives the 
shadows names. An overturned 
clippership, a corpse, proclaims 
Fred as he successfully puts on 
another intellectual fireworks 
display for the audience.
Fred is the center of the film 
and Foster never forgets that in
her directing techniques. She is 
very careful to bring the camera 
down to Freds level and film the 
world from his point of view. 
From four feet off the ground we 
get a feeling of what the world 
looks like to little Fred. Indeed it 
is large and imposing, but Fred 
is the child-explorer whose 
search for intellectual stimula
tion guides him through the big 
bad world.
Although the film is not worth 
six dollars, it is definitely worth 
a second look when it arrives in 
video stores in a few months.

I had this dream the other 
night where I saw Sam Kinison 
murder Dr. Seuss.
It was horrible. Kinison was 
strung out on crystal meth and 
he was screaming, You screwed 
up my life! I hate Yertle the 
Turtle! I wanna throw up every 
time I hear one of those rhymes! 
And Dr. Seuss was just kinda 
laying back, smoking a pipe in 
the corner, saying things like, 
You misunderstand me, my 
corpulent Sam,
You are what you are, I am 
what I am.
And Sam would say, Thats 
what I mean, you mush-head! 
You call that poetry! Theyve got 
monkeys typing on IBM 
Selectrics thatcan dobetterthan 
that!
And this wouldnt bother Dr. 
Seuss a bit:
Have a seat, take a chair, 
Quit your grumping around, 
Take a breath, fix your hair, 
Stop that bellowing sound. 
And this would make Sam 
even more mad, till he just 
started screaming No wonder 
you can only relate to zoo ani
mals! Youre a hack!
And then a very, very strange 
thing happened. The two men 
suddenly started to communi
cate. The louder Sam Kinison 
got, the louder Dr. Seuss got. 
But the louder Dr. Seuss got, the 
quieter Sam Kinison got. And 
pretty soon they were both talk
ing at the same level.
You ever considered barber
shop school? said Kinison. 
You are droll, you are witty, 
But your jokes are not pretty. 
And then, I dont know if it 
was the crystal meth or the situ
ation or some brain vessels goentire life had Dr. Seuss ever 
put anybody down before. And it 
hurt Sam. It made him cry a 
little bit. He stared at his shoes 
for a minute and then he said: 
I meant you no harm,
And I didnt intend 
To do anything more 
Than to make you my friend. 
But Seuss was out of control 
now:
Dont make me laugh!
Oh, what a doozy!
What I wouldnt give 
For a knife and an Uzi!
I would slice you in half, 
Like a deer or a fish,
Mount your head on my wall, 
Pull your legs, make a wish!" 
And thats about when Kinison 
lost it. He started screaming in 
iambic quadrameter about his 
ex-wives, his mother, the Pente
costal church, his girlfriend, and 
everybody who had ever fired 
him from a job.
You were lying to me!
I could change, your books 
said!
I believed you before,
Now Ill sit on your head. 
And just as Sam started to sit 
on Dr. Seusss head, I woke up in 
a cold sweat.
Two days later, Dr. Seuss was 
dead. I feel responsible.
And speaking of great Ameri
can institutions, this weeks 
movie Bikini Island is the story 
of a serial killer who is killing 
Sports Illustrated-type swimsuit 
models with a giant bathroom 
plunger. Drive-in movie scream 
queen Holly Floria goes to a 
cattle call, gets selected by some 
drooling sleazoids to be part of a 
swimsuit edition, takes a couple 
showers, roots around on the 
beach, and eventually battles a

JOE BOB GOES TO 
THE DRIVE-IN

ing haywire, but suddenly 
Kinison trips out and starts 
rhyming!
Have you met my ex-wife? 
What a dud, what a slut, 
Her IQ was less 
Than the width of her butt. 
And there was something 
about that particular rhyme that 
caused Dr. Seuss to break down. 
He couldnt stand it. He said: 
Youre glumping your gums 
In a most tacky way,
If you cant speak politely, 
Then you shouldnt have any
thing to say.
And, when Dr. Seuss said that 
last line, he suddenly blushed, 
knowing that he had finally 
forced a rhyme by putting way 
too many syllables in it. And 
Sam Kinison started laughing 
like a hyena.
Youre not even scanning, 
Youre a hack, youre a joke, 
Even rappers dont do that, 
Your rhymer is broke.
And Dr. Seuss was flustered, 
tryingto gethis composure back. 
And he started screaming: 
Youre a fat smelly creep, 
Youre annoying, youre 
crude,
So get out of my face 
And go shovel more food. 
And even Sam Kinison was 
shocked. Because never in his
bow-and-arrow-wielding Bikini 
Bunny to the death. I hope no 
one out there is laughing, be
cause this is based in part on a 
true story. (I think the fictional 
part is the bow and arrow. The 
serial killer Bikini Bunny actu
ally used poison darts.)

The Adversary
Thursday, October 24
With the arrival of International Festival on 
campus, a movie about the different culture should 
be an enjoyable and educational addendum. Its 
important to know the traditions of other countries 
in order to reach better understandings.
The Adversary tells the story of a young man in 
modem day India, who is having a difficult time 
because hes unable to cope with everyday prob
lems.
Filmed in black and white in the early 70s, the 
movie is the product of famous Indian filmmaker 
Satyajit Ray and was adapted from a story by Sunil 
Ganguli. The exceptional quality of his films iswell 
renowned. Give the film a chance and take that first 
step towards understanding different cultures.

City Slickers
Friday, October 25
In City Slickers, Billy Crystal, Daniel Stern, and 
Bruno Kirby present a grown-up version of Stand 
By Me. The movie opens at Crystals birthday party, 
as his character hits middle age, and mid-life crisis 
soon sets in with a vengeance. So his two best 
friends, Stem, a hen pecked husband, andKirby, an 
insatiable womanizer, take him on a cattle drive, 
hoping to make him feel better.
Through stampedes, floods, horseback riding, 
and a little leering at Helen Slater (who plays the 
only woman on the drive), the men discover theyre 
not worthless or washed up from age. By the end of 
the trip, they even prove themselves as decent 
cowboys, after safely delivering the cattle to their 
destination. They know more about themselves and 
each other, and feel that they are better men for the 
experience.
This is a comfortable, heartwarming film. Crys
tal, as always, is very funny, and the script gives 
him some good material to work with. City Slickers 
is a great movie, worth handing over a dollar to see.

Hamlet
Saturday, October 26
At last, Franco Zeffrelis version of Shakespeares 
classic Hamlet is coming to DH 2210. Starring 
versatile Mel Gibson in the title role, Glenn Close as 
the witchly Gertrude, and charming Helena 
Bonham-Carter as Ophelia, Hamlet brings together 
the best in film, writing, and acting.
The centuries-old tale of Prince Hamlet and his 
coming of age in the rotten state of Denmark, is a 
universal statement about the tragic loss of inno
cence at the hands of a corrupt state. With his 
trademark sensitive touch, Zeffreli paints a re
markably real portrait of lust, insanity, and humili
ation. With his father murdered, mother and uncle 
married, love life in a muddle, and other friends and 
family betraying him at every turn, young Hamlet 
finally throws up his arms in despair and begins his 
own cycle of betrayal and destruction.
The movie has a tried and true plot, complete 
with murder, revenge, love, and anger. Take a 
friend to see Hamlet. The story never dies, although 
quite a few of its characters do.
At 7, 9:30, 12
Creepshow
Sunday, October 27
Directed by CMU alum George Romero, and writ
ten by the master of horror himself, Stephen King, 
Creepshow nicely captures the look of a comic book 
in this homage to the 1950s E.C. Comics.
Filled with five fantastic tales of revenge and 
just desserts, Creepshow wont make you keep the 
lights on while you go to sleep, but it will run a chill 
up your spine. It also has King starring in an 
episode in which a mysterious meterorite lands on 
earth and stars growing.
And even if hon or films arent your cup of tea, 
seeing Margaret Morrison and the CFA parking lot 
in a film (thanks to Mr. Romero) is reason enough to 
see this movie.

The Comic World adds another mouth
Hmm ... I wonder how many 
columns have started with what 
is soon becoming the cliche intro 
of the 90s? I suppose it goes 
something like this:
In the past few years weve 
seen the fall of the Berlin Wall, 
the liberation of Eastern Eu
rope, etc.... Soundfamiliar?Well 
I have a flooby addition to make 
to that ever growing list of color
ful historical events! The birth 
of a darling new comicbook com
pany! Does it not make the sur
prising events of world politics 
pale in comparison? I do think 
so. The proud parents have 
named this nutty toddler Val
iant Comics.
Is it aboy or a girl? No silly, its 
Magnus, Robot Fighter, as well 
as a litter of other smiling new 
species heretofore unknown to 
man. Actually youve caught me 
fibbing, for you see, several of 
these characters are revivals of 
60s heroes who somehow lost 
their way and ended up in comic 
book limbo with ROM Space 
knight and the Shogun Warriors. 
Re-energized and valianated, 
these folks re-emerge under the 
guidance of a name that may 
seem familiar to veteran comic 
book readers.
Remember Jim Shooter, 
former editor-in-chief of the big
gest comic book company in the 
known universe? Where has he 
been, you ask? My in-depth 
sleuthings have surmised that 
James Shooter spent his years 
of seeming unemployment... and 
pregnant! Pregnant with ideas 
of a new comic book company 
that would one day compete in 
the major leagues. Of course he 
didnt get that way by himself 
(as a biologist I can safely come 
to that conclusion), hes had 
plenty of help from other veter
ans like Don Perlin and Barry 
Windsor-Smith. Hes got talent, 
funding, and neat ideas! What 
else does todays successful en
trepreneur need, I ask? Lets 
proceed with an in-depth exami
nation of the results of one of the 
offspring of Mr. Shooter's labor 
pains.

Magnus, Robot Fighter is a 
book set in the far away future 
where robots abound. He was 
brought up by a robot and is the 
worlds foremost hoss on robot

Magnus of the 40th century is! 
He can read archaic teaching 
tools like books, and is a master 
of robotics and engineering. 
Surely, you would like to know 
the origin ofValiantComicsfirst 
and foremost hero? Kind of like 
that rat who turns sentient in 
those Turtle books, a robot with 
the super-creative name, 1-A, 
becomes sentient as well.
1-A is socially conscious, of 
course, and decides that man
kind has become too dependent 
on the robots of the world. He 
wonders, if in the event of a 
horrible malfunction, mansbest 
friend could turn into an auto
cratic, man-hating fiend. Out of 
computer love for the organic 
world, 1-A decides he will train 
the child Magnus into a defender 
of humanity if ever the robots 
lost control! Thus Magnus, Ro
bot Fighter is born! What fol
lows is a bunch of autocratic, 
man-hating fiends who want to 
see robot domination. Magnus 
fights them, and this is the es
sential premise of this series.

no shades of grey in Magnus and 
perhaps thats the greatest
