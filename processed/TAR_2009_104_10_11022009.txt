University holds H1N1 vaccination clinics
Mayoral candidates withdraw from panel
JENNIFER THARP
Staffwriter
In the past few weeks, 
Carnegie Mellon University 
has held clinics for students, 
faculty, and staff to receive 
the seasonal flu shot and the 
vaccine for H1N1, otherwise 
known as swine flu. It first ap
peared in the United States 
in April 2009 and has since 
spread to 46 states. The conta
gious virus, which has proven 
especially to strike those be
tween the ages of six months 
and 24 years, was declared a 
global pandemic by the World 
Health Organization on June 
11 of this year.
As more than 1000 
American citizens, 
including 100 chil
dren, have died,
President Obama 
declared H1N1 
national emer
gency on Oct.
24 of this 
year. In
effect, this declaration gives 
hospitals the power to effec
tively treat those in need with 
such options as alternative 
care sites.
I think that this is an ap
propriate measure because it 
provides health care systems 
with the flexibility and re
sources they will need to re
spond to a high demand 
for care, said Anita 
Barkin, the direcv 
Student

Typi
cally, there 
are 36,000 
flu-related 
deaths a year 
and 200,000 
patients hospitalized 
from nonH1N1 flurelated ef
fects.
By the 
end of 
March or 
April, the 
United 
States is 
hoping to 
have dis
tributed 250 
million doses of 
the vaccine. Ac
cording to www. flu. 
gov, as of Oct. 21, ap
proximately 11 million
doses, including over 400,000 
to Pennsylvania, have been 
issued to states. The vaccine 
comes in two > forms  
one a nasal / spray 
and one / an injec
tion. / The nasal 
/ spray is live 'at/ tenuated [weak
ened] virus. The ingif jection is inactivated 
virijs. The nasal spray 
is not recommended for 
persons who have underly
ing medical conditions like 
asthma or diabetes, said Barkin, explaining the difference 
between the two. The nasal 
spray, which the University 
has distributed, is approved 
for those from ages 2 to 49, 
and adults require one dose 
while children require two.
To ease concerns over the 
new vaccine, the Centers for 
Disease Control (CDC) ex
plained in the pamphlet hand
ed to students who received 
the vaccine that it was made 
in the same manner as the 
one for the seasonal flu. Side 
effects so far appear to be site 
redness and those typical of 
the seasonal flu, such as head
ache, congestion, cough, and 
mild fever. Those with weak
ened immune systems should 
not receive the nasal spray. 
On campus, seasonal flu vac
cines have been made avail
able through clinics that have 
been occurring since midSeptember. Our first H1N1 
vaccine clinics were held on

With the mayoral elec
tions looming just around the 
corner, the Carnegie Mellon 
student government decided 
to host a forum in order to 
make the student body more 
aware of the issues at hand. A 
forum was planned in which 
all three main candidates 
 Mayor Luke Ravenstahl, 
Kevin Acklin, and Franco Dok 
Harris  agreed to come, 
speak, and answer questions. 
All three candidates had con
firmed their commitment 
to the event, understanding 
that the program would not 
be a debate but would consist 
of each man receiving 20 to 
30 minutes alone on stage to 
say their piece and take ques
tions.
The day after Ravenstahl
Maria Raffaele/Assistant Art Editor
spoke at Chatham University 
 where he was faced with 
angry G-20 protesters, stu
dents, and community mem
bers demanding answers to 
tough questions  he pulled 
out of the Carnegie Mellon 
forum. Soon afterward, Ack
lin also pulled out, citing his 
schedule conflicting, leav
ing only Dok Harris.
Its disappointing, said 
Anna Romanova, a sopho
more biology major. This 
would have been a great 
chance for students to hear 
these men speak, and it 
would also have been a great 
opportunity for these candi
dates to hear what students 
are concerned about.

To students, Homecom
ing Weekend means getting 
a free T-shirt or Tartan towel, 
socializing, getting a hot cup 
of chili, and watching the foot
ball game. To alumni, Home
coming Weekend signifies 
Alumni Weekend, reconnect
ing with old classmates over 
dinner, and seeing how much 
the school has progressed. 
But this year, Homecoming is 
much, much more.
Homecoming was given a 
complete makeover this year 
with the revamping of old 
events and the addition of 
new ones. Dana Weinstein, a 
junior business administration 
major and the leader of the 
Student Homecoming Com
mittee, said, The main pur
pose of all of these events is to
get Carnegie Mellon students 
more excited about being here 
and give them a quick break.
It also allows them to have a 
chance to interact with alumni 
in a non-networking environ
ment, which is something that 
they might not get as often as 
they like.
Some of the past events 
that were re-worked this year 
were the Student Homecom
ing Kick-Off BBQ on Wednes, 
day and LMAO, An Evening 
of Comedy and Music, on 
Thursday. The events this 
year were actually an initiative 
started by the committee last 
year. We began these events 
last year because we felt that 
Homecoming wasnt really for 
students, and we wanted to 
make more events that were 
student-centric and would 
make students feel as though 
they were welcomed at Home
coming events, even though 
we do invite alumni to all of 
the student-oriented events, 
said Weinstein.
Spirit Week and the High
land Games were two of the 
new additions to the Home
coming schedule. We added 
a few events this year, such as 
Spirit Week and the Highland 
Games, to replace the B There 
campaign that occurred last 
year during the Friday night 
of Homecoming, so that we 
could still have a larger Friday 
night event, said Weinstein.
Spirit Week gave students 
the opportunity to show off 
their Carnegie Mellon spirit, 
pride, and creativity by dress
ing to the respective days 
theme. The themes were: Rep 
your Hometown, Nerd Day, 
College Spirit Day, Class ColSee HOMECOMING, A3

The food drive will benefit 
the Greater Pittsburgh Com
munity Food Bank, which 
is a non-profit organization 
that collects, stores, and dis
tributes food and household 
products to nearly 350 other 
charitable agencies including 
soup kitchens, food pantries, 
shelters, day care, and senior 
centers for low-income peo
ple and special care facilities.
Drop boxes and barrels 
will be placed around campus 
to accept all non-perishable 
items. Highly requested items 
inctude toilet paper and highprotein foods, including pea
nut butter, tuna, and soups 
that include meat.
On Wednesday, One Day,
One Can will be held during 
Carnegie Mellons Benefits 
Fair in the University Cen
ter. Participants are asked to 
bring a non-perishable food 
item to the Food Drive table.
The Cans Across the Cut 
event will take place from 9 
a.m. to 4 p.m. Nov. 11 at the

Jibbigo LLC, a startup 
company launched by Alex 
Waibel, professor of com
puter science and language 
technologies at Carnegie 
Mellon, has developed an iP
hone application that turns 
the iPhone into a translating 
device.
The app, which runs on 
the new iPhone 3GS, will 
translate both English speech 
to Spanish and Spanish 
speech to English.
The Jibbigo app can rec
ognize over 40,000 spoken 
words. Users simply say 
small sentences or phrases 
into the iPhone and the ap
plication will respond with 
an audible translation. The 
Jibbigo application functions 
as a general translator, but is 
also especially useful to both
international travelers and 
medical doctors. One unique 
aspect of the application is 
that it does not require a wire
less connection to function.
Jibbigos software runs 
on the iPhone itself, so it 
doesnt need to be connected 
to the Web to access a distant 
server, Waibel said.
Thats important for trav
elers and especially for hu
manitarian aid workers who 
venture beyond the big cit
ies. Its in those areas where 
wireless hotspots are few and 
far between  if they exist at 
all  that Jibbigo might be 
needed the most.

City mourns local library closings
MEELA DUDLEY
Assistant Pillbox Editor
A lot of industries have 
been hit hard by the circum
stances of this economic 
slump, and many of the ef
fects of this crumbling econo
my have been witnessed here 
in Pittsburgh.
Most recently, according 
to writer Barbara Ehrenreich 
of the San Francisco Chron
icle, advances in electronic 
books and other easier meth
ods of technological informa
tion sharing have been lead
ing to the death of the book 
industry.
Book sales tracked on 
www.bookwire.com show 
that the book industry has 
always been successful, at 
most times outgrossing both 
the film and music industries 
and always landing among 
the top three moneymaking 
entertainment proprietors in 
the United States.
However, the most recent 
trend among booksellers all 
over the country has been a 
significant drop in sales per
centages.
Local booksellers all over 
the United States have been 
forced to file bankruptcy, 
and larger book chains like 
Barnes & Noble are making 
cutbacks to prevent a similar 
outcome.
Last Wednesday, the Pitts
burgh Post-Gazette reported 
that the Barnes & Noble 
bookstore on Murray Avenue 
in Squirrel Hill would be clos
ing at the end of this year.
Industries outside of book
selling, but greatly affected 
by its success, have begun to 
see the consequences of its 
failure. The Carnegie Library 
of Pittsburgh recently de
cided to close four of its local 
branches in Beechview, West 
End, Lawrenceville, and Ha
zelwood earlier this month.
Additionally, the remain
ing branches will adjust to 
shorter operating hours, mul
tiple staff cuts, and increased 
public fees.
Its sad that the economy 
dictates how the students of 
Pittsburgh can access books,
said Peggy Lees, a first-year 
in the Mellon College of Sci
ence. Its a decision that has 
a direct effect on our educa
tion. I guess I just always 
assumed that having knowl
edge available to us was our 
right.
Carnegie Library director 
Barbara Mistick accredited 
the closures to dwindling li
brary funds in a statement 
posted on CarnegieLibrary. 
org. The post reads, In the 
face of declining revenues and 
projected budget deficits, the 
Board made the very difficult 
decision to adopt an action 
plan that includes reducing 
service hours throughout the 
system, closing and merging 
branch locations and reduc
ing staff.
Due to the large amounts 
of recent public rallying, its 
clear that Carnegie Mellon 
students are not the only 
people who seem upset with 
the Board of Trustee's deci
sion at the Carnegie Library 
of Pittsburgh.
The grassroots crusade 
to fight the library closures 
has moved onto Facebook 
and online petitions. Lobby 
enthusiasts have released 
details about their sched
uled protests, gatherings/ 
and fundraisers in the hopes 
of rallying those neighbor
hood locals directly affected 
by the closures. All libraries 
are important, writes the 
creator of the Facebook li
brary closure petition group, 
Tess McShane, a Homewood 
resident. When one neigh-.
borhood library closes  it 
represents an unraveling of 
Pittsburghs social fabric.
The efforts of these citi
zens have not gone unno
ticed. On Oct. 29, Pittsburgh 
Council President Doug 
Shields, announced that he 
would propose a $600,000 
grant to the Carnegie Li
brary of Pittsburgh this year 
in order to keep the closing 
branches alive.
While nothing is finalized, 
the move is a definite step in 
the right direction for closure 
opposition forces.
Fundraising efforts have 
also seen significant success. 
The Pittsburgh Foundation 
was able to raise over $1.2 
million for charity on Thurs
day, and up to $100,000 of it 
was directly donated to the 
Carnegie Library of Pitts
burgh.
Mayor Luke Ravenstahl 
also released a statement say
ing he was willing to increase 
the citys contribution to the 
library system in order to 
keep the four branches open 
and the people happy.
While the book industry is 
seeing significant downfalls 
all over the United States, 
citizens of Pittsburgh are 
unwilling to accept the local 
consequences. Though citi
zens have been able to have 
an immediate impact on the 
opposition against local li
brary closures, having any 
influence on the closing of 
larger branch businesses like 
Barnes & Noble will prove in
creasingly difficult.

CMU students work ethic battles online distractions
CAROLINE KESSLER
Junior Staffwriter
Zhong Liang starts pro
crastinating every 10 to 3D 
minutes, because every 10 to
30 minutes.he gets a coding 
error. As a sophomore electri
cal and computer engineering 
major, he gets a lot of these 
errors, which leads to a lot of 
time procrastinating, which 
leads to a lot of time on Face
book.
This is a familiar story for 
many, especially at Carnegie 
Mellon, where work abounds 
in various forms: papers, mid
term exams, projects, etc.
For Terry Zhou, a first-year 
math major from China, the 
way Chinese students take 
notes in class is different  
they use only notebooks. But 
at Carnegie Mellon, Zhou 
mainly uses his computer. To 
really focus, he prints notes 
for class to avoid distractions. 
When asked if its better that 
students use laptops less in 
China, he said, I think I use 
my laptop too much; I prefer 
to print something out and 
read it on paper, especially if 
its really hard and requires 
concentration.
Zhous form of procrasti
nation is spending time on 
Facebook. When he feels like 
he has spent too much of his
time on Facebook, he disables 
his account, only to re-enable 
it a few days later.
In contrast, there are 
people like Matt Chabalko, a 
graduate student in electrical 
and computer engineering, 
who spends upward of four 
hours simply surfing the Inter
net. Explaining that he is most 
productive under pressure, he 
sums up his work ethic and 
life philosophy: If it wasnt 
for the last minute, nothing 
would get done.
Then there is the excep
tion to these rules  someone 
like Lizzy Madden, a senior in 
public policy. She" works on 
assignments that are not due 
for two weeks. She said, I 
usually do other work thats 
not as pressing instead of do
ing what1 Im supposed to be 
doing.
She explains that her meth
od of focusing is to change her 
study location often. In the 
transition from high school to 
college, she realized that she 
needed to use resources that 
would help her work consis
tently. She said, I found that 
going to office hours stopped 
me from procrastinating. 
Carnegie Mellons Aca
demic Development center 
recommends moving around 
for 15 minutes for each hour 
of work to increase efficiency.
Students are affected by their 
physical locations, the people 
that surround them, and their 
state of mind. Often, students 
like Madden, who have con
scious realizations on how 
to eliminate distractions and 
use resources wisely, are most 
productive, according to Aca
demic Developments Fast 
Facts on Procrastination.
Zeynep Koraltan, a sopho
more business major, calls her 
friends and family. S.J. Tanzer 
and Fiona Ryder, sophomore 
vocal performance majors* 
spend time talking to friends. 
Others, like fifth-year senior 
physics major Josh Tepper, 
seek out stimulation from oth
er sources. He says that when 
hes not finding fulfillment in 
his work, he tries to find it in 
other places, such as the New 
York Times homepage or on 
Facebook.
 The solution , to procrasti
nation might lie in combin
ing these seemingly opposite 
ideas: working with other stu
dents to satisfy a need for so
cial interaction, while moving 
closer to tasks that need to be 
completed. Peggy Orenstein, a 
writer and editor on womens 
issues, explains that while the 
Internet allows a person to in
dulge in a perpetual pursuit 
of little thoughts, it does not 
lead them to any result.
FORUM, from A1
agreed to be part of the fo
rum, stating that the event 
had never been confirmed 
and that there are a lot of 
forums that they would love 
to attend. McKrell said that 
the mayor had received a 
wonderful response from 
[the] students of Chatham, 
indicating that the response 
there was not associated with 
the decision.
The negativity had only 
come from G-20 protesters 
who couldnt get over the 
incidents of that weekend. 
He then repeated that the 
reason that the mayor could 
not attend Carnegie Mellons 
forum was due to schedul
ing conflicts.
John Fournier, from Kevin
Acklins campaign, said that 
the reasoning behind their 
unfortunate withdrawal also 
had to do with scheduling 
conflicts.
He stated that this was 
unfortunate, as Acklin had 
been actively reaching out 
to the college community of 
Pittsburgh. Fournier said that 
Acklins campaign had not 
[been] aware of the mayors 
decision.
One major issue in the race 
that would actively affect the 
college community is the 
mayors hope to tax students 
in order to raise revenue.
Fournier said that this was 
not even on the table for the 
Acklin campaign. They are 
absolutely opposed to rais
ing taxes on working people, 
which includes hospital pa
tients and students.

Oct. 13 and 15 in the Univer

non, the director of student 
development. The university 
was trying to increase student 
awareness of the vaccine and 
increase turnout.
Im not really sure what 
will make people take it 
more seriously, but hopefully
spreading the word will do 
the trick. Thats why theyre 
having clinics in residence 
halls this wek, mentioned 
Ariel Rosenberg,  resident 
assistant in Stever House and 
a junior science and arts ma
jor.
At the 'flu clinics on Oct. 
26 and 27 in Morewood Gar
dens and the Carnegie Mellon 
Caf, the universitys supply
of approximately 2000 doses 
of nasal spray was depleted. 
More than 1300 students were 
vaccinated since the nasal 
spray was offered, along with 
faculty and staff. Although 
the supplies are currently ex
hausted, the .university is still 
prepared to help those who 
may become ill and will notify 
students as soon as more sup
plies of the vaccine arrive.
The Carnegie Mellon stu
dent body president, Rotimi 
Abimbola, one of those who 
had actively pushed for this 
forum to take place, said that 
it is important for students 
to get educated about the is
sues.
Our voice is a power, 
ful voice, she said, which is 
why she was confused about 
Ravenstahls and Acklins de
cisions. To me it was a big 
deal; [this event is a] huge 
opportunity to reach out to 
many students on campus. 
Abimbola added that Carn
egie Mellon would have tried 
to work around the sched
uling conflicts.

Auto-Tune: Merging music and technology to create the perfect sound
ABHAY BUCH
Junior Staffwriter
You may not know it, but 
its on many of the songs that 
you hear. It is pretty hard for 
untrained ears to notice it, but 
it is very much there. For some 
artists, it is their claim to fame, 
while others pretend that they 
have never used it. Some lis
teners think that it is the best 
thing to happen to popular 
.music, while some think it 
is the worst. Independent of 
public opinion, few technolo
gies in the last 10 years have 
changed the music we listen to 
as much as it has. The techni
cal term for it is pitch correc
tion, but everyone knows it as 
Auto-Tune.
Auto-Tune is actually a 
piece of proprietary software 
made by Antares Software that 
was first released in 1997, and
it has an interesting history. 
The founder of Antares (Andy 
Hildebrand) actually worked 
with Exxon to analyze seis
mic data for oil prospecting. 
This involved sending sound 
waves into the ground and 
listening for the reflections to 
determine the location of oil 
deposits and other regions of 
interest. Of course, the Earths 
crust is a messy and chaotic 
place, and making sense of the 
data required extensive analy
sis to extract useful informa
tion. Hildebrand found that 
many of the methods to do 
this could be applied to audio 
production as well.
What pitch correction soft
ware, like Auto-Tune, does 
is analyze and modify audio 
signals in a very specific way. 
According to Riccardo Schulz, 
associate teaching professor 
at the school of music here at
Carnegie Mellon, pitch correc
tion software is used to fix up 
vocal and other instrumental 
performances. You input the 
key and the scale that a song is 
in to provide a reference frame 
for the software. When the 
software receives an audio sig
nal (someones voice, for ex
ample), it compares the pitch 
of the signal with the correct 
pitches for the given key and 
scale. If the pitch is off, it mod
ifies the signal to move it to the 
correct pitch (hence pitch cor
rection). It is not perfect, how
ever. If the signal is so far off 
the mark that the nearest note 
on the scale is not the note 
you want, it will still shift to 
that wrong note, resulting in 
some awkward sounds. It also 
works better when the pitch is 
off by just a little bit, as large 
shifts tend to introduce noise 
and weird, artificial-sounding
distortion.
It is important to note the 
difference between pitch shift
ing and pitch correction. The 
former involves shifting the 
frequency of the sound in one 
direction or the other to change 
its pitch. It is often done man
ually and has been around 
much longer than effective 
pitch correction software has. 
It is a highly general term that 
has many different implemen
tations. Pitch correction is just 
one such implementation in 
which the pitch shifting is per
formed automatically (by the 
computer) and the shifting is 
used to reach the target pitch 
that the recording engineer 
wants. Schulz notes wryly that 
pitch correction is used for re
cording and live performance, 
especially for singers who dont 
sing in tune. In recording stu
dios, pitch correction is used to
polish tracks and to gloss over 
any mistakes that the singer 
may have made. It provides a 
degree of consistency, which 
allows recording engineers 
to work more effectively. And 
yes, it is used to allow medio
cre vocalists to sound better 
than they would. In live shows, 
it is used extensively to ensure 
that a sore throat or the stress 
of an overlong tour doesnt re
duce the quality of the perfor
mance. Many artists describe 
it as a sort of safety net. 
Schulz also points out 
that for many genres, such as 
hip-hip, pop, and rock, the 
recording is part of the art. 
Many producers and record
ing engineers take this to heart 
and use pitch correction as an 
instrument in itself. The most 
well-known of such producers 
is the artist T-Pain. Pitch cor
rection and its more general
use for pitch shifting can cre
ate new and innovative sonic 
textures. It can also be used to 
allow samples that are in dif
ferent keys or even samples 
that arent musical enough to 
be used freely.
Many would claim that the 
use of pitch correction mar
ginalizes the talent of singers 
by allowing anyone and every
one to belt oufc a pitch-perfect 
song. Indeed, we are all so 
used to hearing perfect voices 
on songs that we now expect 
nothing less, and that very 
expectation ensures that even 
talented vocalists are com
pelled to use pitch correction. 
The truth is that pitch correc
tion cannot salvage truly hor
rible singers. It assists, rather 
than overshadows, most sing
ers and allows them to make 
the songs that we, the listen
ers, demand.
Space programs develop new spacecraft Researchers work to slow down death Google develops free GPS software
Anatoly Perminov, head of Russias space agency, stated 
Wednesday that a nuclear-powered spaceship was necessary for 
the success of the countrys space program. Perminov wants to 
replace the aging Soyuz system used by astronauts for several 
decades and currently used to reach the International Space Sta
tion. Russian president Dmitry Medvedev encouraged his Cabi
net to provide the required $600 million.
According to Perminov, the new design could be completed 
within three years, with nearly another decade needed for con
struction and testing.
After being delayed a day primarily due to poor weather con
ditions, NASA successfully launched the Ares I-X rocket Wednes
day morning.
The rocket, which forms part of the proposed Constellation 
system designed for long-range exploration, lifted off from Cape 
Canaveral, Fla. and flew for approximately six minutes before 
parachuting into the ocean.

Scientists studying the processes of cell decay and death are 
working on a breakthrough that can drastically slow metabo
lism.
Much of the research is being conducted by Mark Roth of 
the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. He believes that 
by replacing oxygen in cells with hydrogen sulfide, cells will not 
decay. He has successfully conducted experiments on fish and 
small mammals.
These creatures are exposed to hydrogen sulfide gas, which 
causes their heart rate and other biological indicators to drop al
most to zero, a state which appears like death.
When the gas is removed and replaced by normal oxygen, the 
subjects return to normal. Roth believes his research, if it can 
be applied to humans, will give doctors more time to conduct 
surgery on critically wounded patients. He received a MacArthur Genius grant for his work, and is currently expanding his 
research to larger animals and humans.

Last Wednesday, Google released Google Maps Navigation, 
a GPS application for phones running its Android 2.0 operating 
system. With similar functionality to existing GPS devices such 
as those by Garmin and TomTom, a primary difference is that 
there is no charge for Googles software.
The application integrates with Google Maps, and therefore 
features such as Google Street View are available to help users 
find their destinations. Traditional GPS manufacturers saw their 
stocks fall dramatically in the immediate aftermath of the an
nouncement. Due to the connectivity of Android devices and 
Googles extensive database, the GPS market will have to recon
sider its business model. At the moment Google Maps Navigation 
is available only on the Verizon Droid, but upcoming Android 2.0 
phones will also have access to this most recent killer app.

Keeping track of the uni
verse is no easy task; after 
all, the edges of the visible 
universe stretch nearly 93 
billion light years across (a 
light year is about six trillion 
miles). Even so, dauntless re
searchers  at Carnegie Mel
lon University, Johns Hopkins 
University, and the University 
of Washington  are striving 
to do just that.
The U.S. Department of 
Energy has supplied a $1.6 
million grant over a period 
of three years to fund the 
research of an automated 
method to detect astrophysical phenomena.
The initiative is a collabor
ative effort between the three 
universities and is headed 
by Jeff Schneider, a research 
professor in Carnegie Mellons School of Computer Sci
ence. According to Schneider, 
limitations currently exist 
in the algorithms scientists 
use to analyze data gathered 
from powerful telescopes. 
Current survey telescopes 
essentially scan the skies, log 
every image and object they 
see, and store them at data 
centers accessible to scien
tists around the world, Sch
neider said.
Researchers have to pre
pare for the future, when 
even more powerful tele
scopes will be used that will 
gather greater amounts of 
data per day. One such tele
scope being built is the Large 
Synoptic Survey Telescope in 
Hawaii, which will be fully op
erational in 2016. Another is 
PAN-STARRS, also in Hawaii, 
which is already operational 
but expected to expand.
However, storing all of 
this data would take up peta
bytes of memory space  one 
petabyte is equivalent to one 
million gigabytes. Sorting 
through this much data, us
ing current methods, would 
be impossible.
As a solution, Schneiders
research is intended to imple
ment several methods to have 
machines sort through the 
data. This would incorporate 
both data mining methods, 
which is the process of find
ing patterns within data, and 
machine learning methods, 
which would allow comput
ers to learn and make deci
sions based on given data.
Schneider hopes to have 
machines implement anoma
ly detection, which has them 
learn a set of data about 
typical objects, and compare 
them with data from new ob
servations.
Atypical objects . would 
be marked as potential new 
discoveries. In addition, he 
hopes to implement unique 
pattern detection, a more 
global form of anomaly detec
tion. As Schneider explained, 
[Unique pattern detection] 
methods follow the same 
basic concept as anomaly de
tection, but they search for 
unique patterns over lots of 
objects rather than a single 
one. For example, maybe it 
would find that stars in gal
axies that have the same size 
and shape as the Milky Way 
tend to also have higher pro
portions of metals in them.
Currently, simulations ex
ist that demonstrate events 
that take place in the uni
verse. Schneider plans to cre
ate algorithms that will bet
ter match these simulations 
to observed activity in the 
universe.
Further plans include 
using only data to create 
simulations to predict future 
events. Here, the algorithm 
starts from scratch and has to 
figure out what the dynamic 
equations of a simulation 
should be in order to gener
ate data like what we observe 
in the sky. This research 
will hopefully bring about a 
better understanding of the 
universe, something so large, 
yet about which we know so 
little. Dark matter and dark

energy, for example, may take 
up most of the observable uni
verse, but our understanding 
is still unclear.
Astrophysics is not the only 
field that can benefit from this 
initiative. Schneider sees a 
larger picture for the future 
of his research: All the other 
sciences, and especially the 
life sciences, are currently be
ing deluged with the same av
alanche of data that is simply 
too much for scientists to un
derstand on their own. They 
need new discovery algo
rithms that will help them un
derstand and find the knowl
edge in their data. He notes 
that their work in science 
has become so complicated 
that, at times, it is necessary 
for computer algorithms, not 
scientists, to make discover
ies. This research will, in ef
fect, have machines analyze 
data and present findings to 
researchers.
Schneider predicts that the 
future will hold even more 
complexity in terms of our 
understanding of the universe 
and the machines we use for 
research.
The details of the scien
tific models themselves may
be too large and complex to 
be understood by individual 
scientists. This will call for 
even more sophisticated algo
rithms that are able to interact 
with scientists.
There are countless discov
eries waiting in the vastness 
of the universe. Schneiders 
outlook for the future of as
trophysics is hopeful: We 
may find new kinds of objects 
that have never been observed 
before. We may find interac
tions that were previously un
known, such as the differing 
types of stars or galaxies that 
exist in very old or very young 
parts of the universe.

Retinoblastoma is a type 
of cancer that develops in the 
retina  the lining of the eye 
that senses light as it comes 
through the front of the eye. 
Though it is a rare form of 
cancer, it is the most common 
form of ocular cancer (cancer 
affecting the eye) in children, 
and according to the National 
Cancer Institute, about 300 
children per year in the Unit
ed States are diagnosed with 
this form.
About 40 percent of retino
blastoma cases are inherited, 
 and this form of cancer was 
actually the first to be associ
ated with a genetic abnormal
ityIt is also possible, how
ever, for retinoblastoma to 
occur sporadically, or with
out a family history. If a ge
netic mutation is found, the 
chance of having a second 
child with retinoblastoma is 
40 to 50 percent, while if no 
genetic mutation is present, 
the chance drops to 2 to 5 per
cent. Retinoblastoma is rarely 
found in adults.
Retinoblasts are rapidly 
growing cells that mature to 
form the retina. However, 
sometimes these cells do 
not stop growing when they 
should, and instead keep re
producing; these excess cells 
then form a tumor in the ret
ina.
These tumors can continue 
to grow  some tumors al
most completely fill the vit
reous humor, the jelly-like 
substance that fills the eye
ball, and others may break off 
and spread to other parts of 
the eye, eventually traveling 
outside the eye to the lymph 
nodes and other parts of the 
body.
Retinoblastoma has been 
linked to mutations in a gene 
called RBI. RBI is a tumor 
suppressor gene that normal
ly prevents cells from under
going uncontrolled division. 
Mutations in RBI give rise to 
the production of a faulty pro
tein that is unable to regulate 
the division of cells. The cells 
thus rapidly multipy, forming 
tumors.
Retinoblastoma can occur 
in either one or both eyes. A 
common symptom is leukocoria, or white pupil. This oc
curs because of the tumor that 
is present in the retina  the 
pupil is not actually white, but 
when a light is shown into the 
eye, it appears to be white. 
Another common symptom is 
that the eyes will appear to be 
looking in different directions, 
along with eye redness, eye 
swelling, and a constant dila
tion of the pupil.
There are a variety of tests 
and treatments available for 
retinoblastoma; the treat
ments used differ depending 
on the location and size of the 
tumor.
Chemotherapy is often 
used to shrink the size of the 
tumor on the retina so that 
another type of treatment can 
be used to completely remove 
the tumor. In addition, che
motherapy can be used when 
the tumor has spread from 
the retina to other parts of the 
body.
There are two types of ra
diation therapy that are used 
to treat retinoblastoma as 
well  internal radiation, or 
brachytherapy, and external 
beam radiation. In any type 
of radiation therapy, high en
ergy beams, such as X-rays, 
are used to kill the cancerous 
cells.
In internal radiation, a 
small disk made of radioactive 
material is stitched into the 
eye near the site of the tumor 
and left for a few days while 
the radiation is released from 
the disk. This allows a higher 
concentration of radiation
In external beam radiation, 
a machine outside the body 
delivers the high-powered 
light beams; however, this 
type of treatment can have 
side effects if the radiation 
reaches the brain, and thus 
this treatment is reserved for 
patients with advanced forms 
of retinoblastoma.
Additional treatments in
clude laser therapy, or laser 
photocoagulation, where a 
laser is used to destroy the 
blood vessels that supply oxy
gen and nutrients to the tu
mor  without a fuel source, 
the cancerous cells die.
Cryotherapy, or cold ther
apy, uses extreme cold to re
peatedly freeze and thaw the 
cancerous cells, which causes 
them to die.
Finally, in hyperthermia, or 
heat therapy, extreme heat is 
directed at the cancerous cells 
through the use of ultrasound, 
microwaves, or lasers. If the 
cancer has not spread beyond 
the eye, survival rates are very 
high. If it has spread, survival 
rates depend on how far the 
tumor has spread.
However, in very severe 
cases, the affected eye must 
be removed. When tljis oc
curs, a ball made of plastics 
and other biocompatible ma
terials is placed in the empty 
eye socket, and the muscles 
that control the movement 
of the eye are attached to this 
implant.
Although the implant can
not see, the eye muscles adapt 
to the implant and control its 
movement just as they con
trolled the movement of the 
natural eye.
A few months after the 
surgery, an artificial eye can 
be placed over the implant, 
custom-made to match the 
healthy eye.
The artificial eye sits be
hind the eyelid and attaches
to be used arid reduces the to the implant, so that as the
chance that the radioactive eye muscles move the implant,
beams will damage healthy it appears as though they are
cells. ' moving the artificial eye.

strated some of the projects with which it has been involved.
is punished for exploiting 
a cherished whale  offer 
the option of listening to the 
voice-over in Maori in addi
tion to English. Like Finding 
Nemo, the Whales exhibit 
offers treats for both chil
dren and adults interested in 
whales. A life-size replica of 
a blue whales heart invites 
anyone of a smaller stature 
to climb through and listen 
to it beat. There is even infor
mation inside inaccessible to 
the average fully grown adult 
and meant exclusively for 
children. On the other hand, 
a child is not as likely as an 
adult to appreciate the raft 
invented by New Zealanders 
to rescue beached whales on 
display on the other side of 
the room. Dispersed among 
the entertaining information
 such as a small chamber 
in which visitors can listen 
to the sounds that a variety 
of whales make  are a few 
more emotionally charged 
displays. In a jar, there is a 
torn plastic bag that once con
tained a pair of rubber gloves. 
This bag was extracted from 
the stomach of a Shepherds 
beaked whale and was deter
mined to have been the cause 
of the whales death.
The Maori, like the popu
lation of New Zealand as a 
whole, were among some of 
the most prolific commercial 
whale hunters in the 19th and 
early 20th centuries, though 
now they represent some of 
the strongest opponents of 
commercial whaling. A few 
particularly vicious-looking 
weapons are encased beside 
a history of whaling in New 
Zealand, where the whale 
was used for its meat, oil, 
teeth, and bones. It was such 
a significant part of their lives 
that the Maori word paraoa 
means both sperm whale 
and chief.
The sperm whale is a 
prominent feature of the 
Whales exhibit: Two huge 
sperm whale skeletons face 
visitors the moment they 
walkthrough the doors to the 
exhibit. The skeletons dwarf 
even those of the dinosaurs 
visible a few floors below the 
entrance.
It is the largest of the 
toothed whales, a subgroup 
of whales that includes dol
phins and porpoises. The blue 
and the humpback whales 
are known as baleen whales
 ones whose diet con
sists mostly of krill. Toothed 
whales hunt larger fish and 
other marine creatures. One 
of the challenges of hunting 
in the darkest, deepest parts 
of the ocean is that visibility 
is minimal, so toothed whales 
rely on echolocation to locate 
prey. Echolocation is featured 
in a number of portions of the 
exhibition, including a video 
explaining how it functions as 
a sperm whale hunts a giant 
squid. The sound is expelled 
from an organ in the whales 
head, and  like sonar  
bounces off an object in the 
distance back to the whale. 
The whales interpret the 
sound using a set of bones in 
the back of their jaws in a pro
cess similar to the one used 
by the bones inside a humans 
ear. Whales fins are another 
place where the anatomy 
resembles human anatomy. 
One portion of the exhibit 
explains how whales evolved 
from hoofed mammals on 
land. There is enough infor
mation in this comprehensive 
exhibit to teach something 
new to almost everyone  a 
great example of the kind of 
multidisciplinary learning in
spired by Andrew Carnegie.
Whales \ Tohora will be on 
display at the Carnegie Mu
seum of Natural History until 
May 2.

On Oct. 29, the Perlis 
Atrium in Newell-Simon Hall, 
where TechBridgeWorld In
teractive took place, had an 
almost festive atmosphere 
about it.
Everywhere there were 
people of all agesthere were 
even some tech-sawy toddlers 
running around. Tables set up 
across the atrium had students 
explaining the various projects 
that TechBridgeWorld under
took.
TechBridgeWorld is a pro
gram at Carnegie Mellon Uni
versity in which students use 
technology to help underde
veloped countries.
This year marked their
fifth year of activity, and it 
also marked the first year an 
internship was open for Carn
egie Mellon students.
Several of the students 
who were part of the intern
ship, known as Innovative Stu
dent Technology Experience 
(iSTEP), explained their many 
innovations that they put to 
use in countries like Tanzania 
and Ghana. Several video 
and slide show presentations 
helped explain the goals of 
iSTEP.
Bradley Hall, a senior in 
mechanical engineering who 
was part of iSTEP, helped in
troduce new cell phone tech
nologies to social workers in 
Tanzania.
These phones were used 
for collecting data from the
field and aggregating it, 
Hall explained. The social 
workers would keep track of 
the countrys demograph
ics, including the number of 
impoverished children in their 
area, and send the data to a 
major city in Tanzania, Dar 
es Salaam, where it would be 
inserted into a government 
database.
The internship will once 
again be available in the 
summer of 2010, working 
to improve the technology 
available and to collaborate 
with other organizations and 
schools.
Hall was also part of a 
team that developed the Elec
tronic ,Braille Tutor, a device 
that would assist the blind 
population in learning written
braille.
Using an electronic stylus 
pen and a series of cells, the 
student could choose a variety 
of learning activities, from let
ter recognition to full-fledged 
free spelling of words.
The audio feature of the 
Braille Tutor is especially use
ful. In Tanzania, many teach
ers of blind students are blind 
themselves,'and if the audio is 
there to correct any mistakes, 
it saves the teacher from hav
ing to rewrite the students 
work themselves.
Another important piece of 
technology on display was the 
Literacy Cell Phone game. Di
rected toward primary school 
students in Tanzania, it was 
a game that tested grammar 
that could be downloaded 
onto a cell phone.
Its subjects, however, ex
tended far beyond proper 
sentence syntax. One test run 
yielded questions about soc
cer and the Swahili language, 
and a correct answer resulted 
in a graphic of a soccer player 
scoring a goal appearing on 
the screen.
Along with such displays 
of innovative technology, 
there was even an online in
teractive quiz on the coun
tries involved in TechBridge
World and computer facts in 
general. M. Bernardine Dias, 
the creator and director of 
TechBridgeWorld, said she 
based her mission for this 
project on her childhood in Sri 
Lanka.
I was fascinated by the 
technology, but I realized 
that the technology coming 
in wasnt able to fit into our 
culture. This became the 
goal for TechBridgeWorld as a 
whole: technology that could 
be adapted to a specific cul
ture.
The goal of a project 
changes depending on what 
the community needs, said 
Beatrice Dias, a Ph.D. student 
in engineering and public 
policy, who is also a part of 
TechBridgeWorld.
Congratulations!
The School of Computer Science wishes to publicly acknowledge the outstanding 
academic achievement of the following students who have been named to 
the Dean's List for the Spring 2009 semester.

Ravenstahls absence shows lack of concern
In the past eight days, incumbent 
mayor and mayoral candidate Luke 
Ravenstahl has bailed on events or
ganized by the University of Pitts
burgh and Carnegie Mellon in which 
he could have reached out to local 
university students just days before 
he runs for reelection.
On Sunday, Oct. 25, Ravenstahl 
did not show up for a planned de
bate with the two other candidates, 
Franco Dok Harris and Kevin Acklin. 
Later in the week, Ravenstahl pulled 
out of a forum organized by Carn
egie Mellon Student Body President 
Rotimi Abimbola, saying he never 
committed to attending.
It seems like Ravenstahl is suggest
ing that he will attend these planned 
forums to the point of exciting those 
who are planning on attending his 
forums or lectures, perhaps thinking 
that awareness of his presence in the 
race alone should be enough to se
cure their votes. In both the Univer
sity of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mel
lon instances, Ravenstahls campaign 
manager, Paul McKrell, claimed the 
mayor never completely confirmed 
that he would attend either event. 
In the case of Ravenstahls absence 
at the University of Pittsburgh, com
mittee member Whitney McNamara 
even said she had been in contact 
with the Ravenstahl campaign a few 
days before the scheduled forum and 
that he had not cancelled  indi
cating the mayor still planned to be 
there.
Issuing dubious statements like 
the Carnegie Mellon event had 
never been confirmed, as McKrell 
argues, rather than firmly commit
ting or skipping out on an event for 
precise reasons, indicates that Ra
venstahl might be just as flaky if re
elected as mayor. It is primarily the 
responsibility of the candidates to 
make their platforms available and 
their presences felt by the citizens 
who will be voting for them. When 
students at the two most prominent
universities in the city reach out to 
the candidates and 6rganize forums 
for the candidates to speak  and 
not even have to debate, in the event 
organized by Carnegie Mellon  it is 
embarrassing for both sides for the 
candidates to not even show up.
Pittsburgh is on the brink of com
ing back. We have robots, we have 
medicine, and we have education. 
Citizens are excited, and grassroots 
movements are happening around 
the city  which Ravenstahl should 
have been witnessing in his current 
term as mayor. Shouldnt the mayoral candidates  especially the in
cumbent  be as excited as the citi
zens they are theoretically hoping to 
represent?
We hope Ravenstahl will step it up 
in his final day of campaigning before 
tomorrows election. The people of 
Pittsburgh deserve a representative 
who can communicate with them, 
and be open to criticism or questions 
about his campaign and actions.
Proposed fees take advantage of loyal customers
Sometimes, age old advice chang
es. If you think back to when you got 
your first credit card you likely had 
someone telling you three things: 
Only use the card in emergencies, 
dont use th card too much because 
thats how you get in trouble, and al
ways, always, pay your bill on time.
Leave it to the current state of the 
economy for credit card companies 
to realize they dont make nearly as 
much money as theyd like on people 
who follow the above advice. Their 
best customers are those that they 
havent figured out how to squeeze 
as much profit out of. And what bet
ter way to increase their profit mar
gins, than to add additional fees for 
people who behave as above.
Proposed fees for not using the 
card, spending too little on the card, 
and paying your bills on time might 
be coming down to consumers short
ly. That is, if the government doesnt 
stop them from what seems to be a 
ploy to just make credit cards more 
expensive to everyone now that they 
have become commonplace.
If these fees were to become re
ality, we think it would probably be 
a good time to just go back to using 
debit cards, or scary as this sounds 
to a college community that doesnt 
understand anything that isnt 
digitahcash.
What a revolution that would be, 
switching back to the exchange of 
money that most directly financially
benefits the consumer and the seller, 
in cutting out the middle man that 
just sends numbers over the wire. 
The money they would lose in credit 
card fees alone is outrageous, but 
also gone would be their lucrative 
profiles of consumer spending habits 
that they can no longer share with 
their partners.
Yet many would prefer not to lose 
the convenience of the fast transac
tion, and so its not likely that credit 
cards are going to stop being used 
anytime soon. So credit card com
panies, lets rethink this idea. Find 
a different way to improve your bot
tom line. We realize times are tough, 
but pity on any sort of financial insti
tution is a bit hard to muster.
Bookstore closing highlights shift in publishing industry
A Pittsburgh Post-Gazette article 
announced the closing of the Barnes
& Noble store on Murray Avenue in 
Squirrel Hill by the end of the year. 
Mary Ellen Keating, a spokesperson 
for the company, called it a business 
decision, which, of course, explains 
absolutely nothing.
This leaves a major pedestrian 
shopping area without a traditional 
bookstore, though further down 
Murray is a used bookstore.
In April, 247wallst.com included 
Borders on a list of 12 companies to 
disappear by 2010. The pressures 
from online booksellers like Amazon, 
as well as the new e-book readers 
available, were cited as reasons the
companyj^as dropping in earnings.
For traditional book advocates, 
this news spells T-R-O-U-B-L-E.
The Amazon Kindle and Sony 
Reader represent a major shift in the 
publishing industry. No longer are 
publishers bound to wait for print
ers, and no longer must they waste 
valuable money shipping books.
But what of those who will miss 
the tactile experience of flipping 
through pages, the smell of paper 
as it ages? Perhaps some would call 
them old-fashioned, but even among 
the first-years who grew up with the 
Internet ubiquitous there are some 
who enjoy reading a physical book.
More consumers, however, are
turning toward the Internet to pur
chase their books. Shifting into the 
new economy, Barnes & Noble is 
closing smaller stores and even intro
ducing its own e-reader  the Nook.
Some of us will miss the experi
ence of walking into a bookstore, 
browsing the section for a title or 
cover that pops out at us, and read
ing enough of the first few pages to 
determine if its worth a read.
But this ever-shrinking popula
tion of consumers is being outpaced 
by the voluminous crowds shirking 
the terrifying outside world in favor 
of the ease of online shopping.
As the world turns, the pages stop 
turning.
Cancer findings may 
lead to breakthrough
Chemotherapy, radiation, sur
gery, pain, recurrence  cancer.
But when two new words, spon
taneous disappearance, were add
ed to this list of cancer vocabulary, I 
was surprised. Yet a New York Times 
article describes just that  cancers 
which simply disappear, all on their 
own, without any treatment.
The Times article describes a sig
nificant study that analyzed data 
from screening tests for breast and 
prostate cancers. In certain cases, 
the screening tests detected small 
tumors, which would actually re
duce in size over the years, and, in 
certain cases of breast cancer, dis
appear completely. The article goes 
on to report cases of various cancers 
in which the patients showed up for 
surgical removal of the tumor, but 
the surgeons found nothing but scar 
tissue,, indicating the presence of 
a past tumor that had since disap
peared.
The idea of having something like 
cancer just vanish seemed incredu
lous at first, and as I read the article, 
I had a million questions running 
through my head. How does some
thing this serendipitous happen? 
How can the body suddenly find 
the ability to take care of this tumor 
when it clearly could not handle it 
before? I scanned the article trying 
to look for answers to my questions, 
and although many questions were 
left unanswered, the article did 
mention a few possibilities in this 
direction.
The article suggested spontane
ous reversion of the mutant cells to 
their original condition. Another 
interesting possibility that the ar
ticle presented was that a variety 
of factors, including the behavior of 
cells surrounding a tumor, the hor
mone level in cancer patients, and 
the immune system of the patients, 
can affect the way a tumor grows. In 
fact, the article quotes a doctor say
ing, [Tumors need the cooperation 
of] the whole organism. Although 
I dont quite believe that by simply 
thinking away cancer, the tumor 
will disappear, it could mean that a 
positive attitude on the part of the 
patient can contribute to the reduc
tion of the tumor.
The implications of this discovery 
are tremendous. If there are certain 
factors that cause tumors to simply 
disappear, it could mean that one 
day expensive and painful chemo
therapy will not be needed. If things 
like a positive attitude, a boost in 
ones immune system, and different 
hormone levels really do contribute 
to the shrinking of tumors, we may 
have found an easy way to deal with 
a problem that has been plaguing 
us for a long time. Cancer research 
has been going on for years now and 
we really havent seen any break
throughs.
If scientists move forward with 
this new discovery, we might get the 
breakthrough that weve been look
ing for.
Although were far from solving 
the cancer puzzle, this discovery 
presents a new foundation on which 
subsequent cancer research can be 
built. I can only hope that this vein 
of research continues in the future, 
and that the exciting discoveries 
that have been found so far lead to 
more.

Videos do not change 
babies into Einsteins
Is your child not a Baby Mozart 
or Baby Shakespeare? Dont worry, 
Disney will refund you the full price 
of any of the Baby Einstein videos 
that didnt turn your child into a 
genius  though there is no return 
policy for the number of hours wast
ed staring at the television screen.
Disneys Baby Einstein videos 
reached a peak in popularity in the 
last few years. A New York Times ar
ticle references a 2003 study that 
found that a third of all American 
babies from 6 months to 2 years old 
had viewed at least one of these vid
eos. The counterintuitive part, how
ever, is that the American Academy 
of Pediatrics recommends no time in 
front of the television at all for chil
dren under two. Perhaps this, com
bined with the fact that the videos 
were not found to increase levels of 
intelligence in children, is why Dis
ney was so willing to refund the re
tail price of any of the videos.
The discovery that comes along 
with the refund is more important 
than the refund itself  putting a 
young child in front of a television 
will not make them smarter. I have 
seen many advertisements that have 
tried to take teaching young chil
dren out of the hands of the parents. 
I grew up during the Hooked on 
Phonics craze, where the minute
a child showed any difficulty read
ing, the parents would rush out to 
buy the Hooked on Phonics kit 
that guaranteed such wonderful re
sults. While Im sure it did work in 
many cases, I would also bet that 
parents working with their children 
Wouldve attained the same results.
I dont have a problem with tech
nology being used in education. I do 
most of my research for classes on 
the Internet. But I do have a prob
lem with technology being used to 
replace what could and should be 
face-to-face interaction. How did 
parents miss the American Academy 
of Pediatrics recommendation re
garding television time and instead 
choose to believe the educational 
claims made by a video that consists 
of little more than bright colors and 
puppets?
Parents need to reevaluate their 
involvement in the lives of their 
young children. Instead of focusing 
on their intelligence levels before 
they have even uttered a single word, 
parents should focus on spending 
time with their children. Having 
high ambitions for your children and 
wanting them to be the next Mozart 
or Shakespeare is good, but teaching 
them that they can learn through ex
perience and not educational videos 
is even better.
Heather Tomko (htomko@) is not, 
was not, and never will be Hooked on 
Phonics.

'The Thing because Kurt Russels 
the man
Overweight people may soon be 
adding more than their pounds to 
their daily consumption  a Senate 
bill passed last week could soon have 
them paying more for their health 
insurance. The health reform bill 
would allow employers and private 
insurers to charge overweight people 
more money than people of healthy 
weights for their health care cover
age.
The reasoning for the Senate bill 
is two-fold. First, overweight people 
are more likely to develop expensive 
health problems for the insurer, such 
as heart disease and diabetes, which 
can be directly caused by weight 
gain. According to the CDC, the list of 
more vulnerable diseases numbers at 
least 30. Second, in a country where 
two-thirds of adults are overweight 
or obese, there would be encour
agement for these at-risk people to 
reduce weight gain by eating less or 
exercising.
Clearly, something needs to be 
done in a country with a majority of 
the population overweight. The bill 
presents a wellness initiative; how
ever, this is not the answer  for 
several reasons. Some people are 
genetically prone to larger weights,
and thus find it harder to lose weight. 
These people could then continue to 
be penalized despite their best ef
forts to lose the weight. The same 
could apply to people living at or be
low the poverty line. When fast food 
is all that people can afford, weight 
gain is very likely, and monetarily pe
nalizing these people for such an ef
fect would only worsen their poverty 
state. The bills protection for such 
circumstances comes in its barring of 
incentive programs that are overly 
burdensome, highly suspect in the 
method chosen to promote health 
or prevent disease, or a subterfuge 
for discriminating based on a health 
factor, according to a slate.com ar
ticle. The vague terminology of these 
promises, however, lacks clearly en
forceable situations.
An even more controversial com
ponent of the bill is the allocation of 
actual U.S. tax dollars to Medicaid 
and Medicare incentive programs to 
improve healthy habits. Each year, 
$15 million and $100 million would 
be appropriated to Medicare and 
Medicaid, respectively, to promote 
monetary incentive programs for 
those who demonstrate changes in 
such areas as smoking, cholesterol 
control, and weight reduction. The 
health reform bill promises to rigor
ously measure these changes and 
outcomes. With tax dollars at stake,
however, and no regulatory agency 
or committee clearly set up to moni
tor these programs, the current con
ditions are not enough. When this 
much tax money is being reallocated 
in the midst of an economic reces
sion, the conditions for incentive re
wards must be clearly outlined and 
monitored so as to most efficiently 
use this money that could perhaps be 
used in another area of the economy 
that is struggling.
All matters considered, the most 
effective form of weight reduction 
for Americas vast overweight popu
lation should come not from govern
ment regulations or appropriations, 
but rather, from education. The sta
tistics available on population obe
sity back up this idea that education 
lies at the crux of the problem. The 
United States features an adult popu
lation in which 67 percent of people 
are overweight, and 34 percent of 
this group is obese. For the rest of 
the population under 20 years old, 
however, the results are even more 
troubling: Children aged 2-5, 6-11, 
and 12-19 have respective chances of
11, 15, and 18 percent of being over
weight. This means that children are 
not only growing up in a population 
of overweight adults, but that too 
many of them are being premature
ly immersed into their own culture 
of over-consumption. Both parents
and children need to be educated on 
what defines healthy food, as well as 
the importance of physical exercise 
in a healthy diet.
According to current projections, 
if childhood obesity continues to in
crease at its current rate, at least half 
of the U.S. population will be obese 
by the year 2050, according to a 2007 
government study. The problem with 
this staggering increase is a resultant 
rise in serious health problems and 
allocation of resources to manage 
this population. Some nutritionist 
experts and media sources have even 
begun to call childhood obesity an 
epidemic.
The Senate health reform bill 
does not address education or child
hood obesity at all, and includes only 
a meager, vague attempt at confront
ing adult obesity. To change the state 
of obesity in the United States) we 
need more. We need public educa
tion movements and requirements 
related to obesity and beginning 
in the primary years. Government 
regulation can definitely add to the 
effectiveness of obesity reduction. Its 
legislation, however, must be better 
thought-out and defined than the bill 
the Senate passed last week.

I iMa/y .j
I recently informed two of my 
friends, who have been holed up 
living under a rock studying for Ex
perimental Bio-Organic Molecular 
Chemistry or something, that they 
were planning to tax us college stu
dents for being college students. I 
. asked them what they thought.
My friends, who have the un
earthly ability to insert information 
in their heads without sleeping, said 
that maybe now was not the best 
time to have an intelligent debate; 
they were exhausted and had been 
thinking a bit too hard about molecu
lar biophysics to think about the fact 
that we might be getting screwed. I 
insisted we have this conversation.
After clearing our heads, we de
cided that we were strongly opposed 
to the 1 percent tax on our tuition. 
Our main complaint was that the rea
soning for the tax was not legitimate. 
We definitely didnt see ourselves as 
free riders, supposedly benefiting 
from the citys infrastructure and of
ferings at no cost.
We bring the city so much com
merce! my friend, whom we shall 
call Ronald Weasley, exclaimed. We 
then discussed how the colleges in 
the area attract so many students, 
thereby bringing along a fortunes 
worth in edutainment spending, 
including the army of sleepy children 
willing to pay $4.50 for a double-shot 
latte. It was all a big conspiracy! They 
work us hard for this very purpose!
I pointed out that we do get nice 
benefits, like the cheap fries at Fuel 
and Fuddle at a ridiculous time at 
night. Half-off deserves credit for 
being totally on the ball for design
ing itself to benefit college students,
unlike the tax, which imposes a pun
ishment for being an undergraduate 
and ironically penniless.
This then led me to think that if 
theyre calling us free riders and end 
up taxing us for riding a little too 
freely in the Carnegie Mellon bubble 
that is basically composed of going to 
class and back (wild!), we should get 
more benefits for officially being the 
citys residents.
We should get beyond half-off and 
get three-quarters-off. We should get
a giant elevated walkway that runs 
the length of Forbes for when water 
pipes burst. We should get free pierogies and ketchup. I want a bouquet 
of flowers every time I land at the 
airport. Each student should get a 
Segway for when the buses dont 
run on time. Every time I walk into 
Crepes Parisiennes or Lulus I should 
get a proverbial pat-on-the-back for 
being an awesome citizen and sup
porting the citys locally-owned eat
eries, maybe even a free topping on
ROTIMI ABIMBOLA AND ADAM KLEIN
The Student Government Exec
utive Branch is always looking for 
ways to tailor our initiatives to Car
negie Mellon students in the hope 
that it will lead to a better college 
experience for everyone. We are in 
the process of redefining the Tar
tan Rewards Program so that it is 
better suited for Carnegie Mellon 
students and covers all aspects of 
the CMU experience.
Not only will the program re
ward students who support Car
negie Mellon athletics, it will also 
start to reward students for at
tending any event on campus that 
they ordinarily wouldnt attend. By 
encouraging students to get out of 
their bubbles, the Tartan Rewards 
Program will facilitate students 
taking advantage of everything 
that CMU has to offer.
After using multiple athletic 
events as trial runs for the pro
gram, we are ready to expand the 
Tartan Rewards Program to new 
arenas.
The new program will continue 
to cover athletic events, and will 
also expand to service-oriented 
events, academic development 
events like the University Lecture 
Series, professional and career 
development events, and, finally, 
student performances.
Starting now, we invite all or
ganizations to apply to be a part 
of the Tartan Rewards Program. 
Being a part of the Tartan Rewards 
Program will be beneficial to your 
organization, and will help allow it 
to reach its full potential by expos
ing as many students as possible to 
your events, via the rewards incen
tive.
As we have stated previously, 
students who attend Tartan Re
ward events are entered into an 
ongoing yearlong raffle for prizes 
that include $50 gift cards, MP3 
players, a flat-screen TV, etc. The 
more Tartan Reward events you 
attend, the more likely you are to 
win one of the rewards.
When your organization is a 
part of the Tartan Rewards Pro
gram, not only will you be able 
to advertise for your events your
self, but Student Government will 
also simultaneously promote your 
event, which will increase student 
awareness of the wide range of ac
tivities on campus.
 We believe this revamping of 
the Tartan Rewards Program will 
lead to greater school pride and 
more success for campus organiza
tions. If you or your organization 
is interested in becoming a part 
of the Tartan Rewards Program, 
please contact us at stugov.cmu@ 
gmail.com.
a crepe.
Hell, if Im paying a 1 percent tu
ition tax, I expect not only extrava
gant benefits, but a feel-good high 
from contributing to the city all the 
time.
If theyre going to tax us, theyd 
better watch out: Were going to free 
ride a lot harder.

clock in the fourth quarter.
With the score close and 
the clock running down, the 
Tartans turned on a power
ful rushing attack. Through 
15 plays, a 75-yard drive, and 
eliminating 8:32 off the clock, 
the Tartans increased their 
lead. Junior running back
Justin Pratt scored a one-yard 
touchdown, making the score 
21-13 with only 1:36 left in 
the game.
The Bears had one last 
chance to bring the game 
back, but this was soon halted 
by an interception by Zacharias. This interception se
cured the Homecoming win 
for our Tartans. The offense
really pulled through with 
an 8-minute drive late in the 
fourth quarter, said Zachari
as. Were all ecstatic that we 
never gave up and were able 
to get our fifth win.
The football team will play 
its last home game in Gesling

both teams. The race con
cludes the fall season for the 
crew teams.
Our fifth-place finish was 
an improvement from last 
year and a good way to end 
the season, junior mens cap
tain Justin Perry said. Now 
we know who is still ahead of 
us, and that will be our moti
vation to train all winter.
The Tartans came into 
this challenging race strong, 
building off their success from 
strong finishes at the Head of 
the Ohio a few weeks back.
The Tartans had boats 
entered in five categories 
that also included mens 
and womens varsity 8+ and 
mens lightweight IX. The
mens team is coxed by gradu
ate student Bryan Cheung and 
rowed by Perry and juniors 
Sean Lubner, Jonah Coste, 
and Ed Burn. The womens 
side is coxed by junior Nadja 
Yacker and is supported by se
nior rowers Alyssa Fogel and 
Megan Larcom, junior Claire 
Herdeman, and first-year 
Paige Wilson.
Beginners luck did not 
help the mens novice 4+ 
team, who managed to finish 
the race in 23:42 but collided 
with an opposing boat during 
the race.
The race felt really good. 
We were in a good shape and I 
think we held our own against 
the other crews, sophomore 
Dmitriy Yakubov of the novice 
mens 8+ team said. I think
there is room for improvement 
and our time could be better, 
but at the end of the day, I 
believe everyone in that boat 
gave all they had to give, and 
thats what matters most. 
The [Head of Occoquan] 
course was definitely the 
most challenging course Ive 
ever coxed, but the girls in 
my eight and four were able 
to power through the turns, 
coxswain Gabbi Coloyan not
ed. The girls in the four were 
especially able to crank on the 
power, and we were able to 
beat Pitt.
The crew teams have one 
scrimmage left against Pitts
burgh and Duquesne at Wash
ingtons Landing on the North 
Shore before they head into 
winter training.
SOCCER, from A12
teams tallying more than 10 
shots, the 1-0 scoreline stood 
and Rochester went on to 
claim the victory.
Carnegie Mellon came into 
the game slightly fatigued, as 
this was their second away 
match in three days. The Tar
tans were able to beat Case 
Western Reserve University
2-0 on Friday, when Griffin
scored his 18th goal of the 
season and Browne put one 
in as well. Senior goalie Maks 
Khurgin recorded his 11th 
shutout of the season.
The Cardinal and Gray are 
now 14-2 for the season and
5-1 in conference play. Going 
into the last week of the regu
lar season, Carnegie Mellon 
and Rochester are now tied 
for first in the UAA, and a loss 
this week for either team will
determine the regular season 
conference champions. With 
the NCAA tournament less 
than two weeks away, the last 
game of the season will be es
pecially important for seeding 
and whether the Tartans will 
play at home in the first two 
rounds of the tournament.
Carnegie Mellon finishes 
off the regular season this Sat
urday as they travel to Atlanta 
to face Emory University.

The Carnegie Mellon 
mens and womens cross 
country teams traveled to 
Cleveland, Ohio this Hallow
een to compete at the Uni
versity Athletic Association 
(UAA) Championship, hosted 
by Case Western Reserve 
University. The mens team 
finished the meet tied with 
Emory for their third consecu
tive second-place finish at the 
meet, 26 points behind New 
York University, who took the 
title for die fourth consecu
tive year. The women placed 
seventh, 12 points ahead of 
the University of Rochester.
The Tartan men were led 
by sophomore Matt Jacobs 
sixth-place performance in 
the 8k as he crossed the line 
in 26:33.69, 26.97 seconds 
behind the winner. Junior 
J.P. Allera finished next for 
the Tartans 12.86 seconds 
behind, ending in 11th place, 
and senior Dario Donatelli 
(26:53.44) and junior Dan 
Addis (26:54.70) finished in 
14th and 15th respectively. 
Juniors Nate Bussiere (21st) 
and Justin Kurp (43rd), as 
well as senior Chris Rizzo 
(48th), rounded out the field 
for the Tartans to secure the 
tie, as Emorys bottom three 
runners placed 28th, 36th, 
and 53 rd.
I feel that I personally ran 
very well, mens captain Do
natelli said. I have had a poor 
season so far, but in the meet 
this week, I was a lot closer to 
where I feel I should be. Our 
goal was to be competitive 
with NYU and to beat Emory
this week. We were able to 
be close to NYU and we were 
obviously very competitive 
with Emory so we are happy 
with the teams performance. 
Our fifth man Nate ran very 
well as he was able to get up 
and be competitive where we 
need him to be to allow us to 
compete at a high level.
The womens side was able 
to yield equally strong results. 
First-year Emily Wobb contin
ued her strong rookie season, 
finishing 10th overall in the 
6k with a time of 24:10.22. 
Wobb has now been the Tar
tans top finisher in all six of 
their races this year. Junior 
Courtney Baker came in 19th 
place at 24:28.44, followed 
a minute later by first-year 
Jackie Altshuler (25:28.06) 
in 44th and junior Danielle 
Morse (25:35.19) in 47th. Ju
nior Laura McKee, first-year 
Eva Humphrey, and sopho
more Cassie Wallace also 
scored points for Carnegie 
Mellon, finishing 57th, 58th, 
and 68th, respectively.
The conditions of the 
course didnt allow anyone 
to finish with a good time, 
but the experience was awe
some, said Wobb, who ran 
a 6k at Oberlin last week in 
a quick 21:56. The race was 
really messy, but a lot of our 
girls had good races and our 
guys performed really well. 
I had lost contact with the 
top group early in the race... 
we were spread out too far 
apart.
Both teams now have a 
two-week hiatus before com
peting at Lehigh Universitys 
Mideast Regional in Bethle
hem, Pa. on Nov. 14.

fourth on the 3-meter board.
I was upset that I didnt 
win the 100-yard breaststroke, 
but I tried my best and didnt 
let it stop me from doing my 
best in my next event, said Yu, 
who won her next event, the 
200-yard breaststroke. Stillo 
believed in her team, adding, 
I think we did really well. We 
had a lot of lifetime best times 
and amazing swims, which I 
think really shows where this 
team is headed.
The mens team also had
an outstanding meet, winning 
nine events. The Tartans were 
able to start off the meet with 
a great start, taking first and 
second place in the 200-yard 
medley relay.
The winning team of ju-, 
nior Michael Panzitta, senior 
Jason Huber, first-year Dan

Dahlen touched in with a time 
of 1:39.16.
Senior Jonas Altman-Kurosaki had a great meet, winning 
both of his individual events in 
the 500-yard and 1000-yard
freestyle. The men were able 
to sweep the 1000-yard free
style, with Altman-Kurosaki 
in first, junior Frank Olechnowicz finishing second, and 
senior Gates Winkler touch
ing third. Glaser-Garbrick also 
had an impressive meet, win
ning the 100-yard and 200- 
yard butterfly.
First-years Brandon Yee 
and Arthur Hong placed sec
ond and third in the 200-yard 
butterfly with times of 1:58.41 
and 2:01.92, respectively. Yee 
also placed second in the 200- 
yard freestyle (1:44.78) and 
third in the 100-yard butterfly 
(53.80).
The Tartans also swept 
the 100-yard breaststroke,
with Huber finishing first in 
1:00.31 and Seo a close sec
ond at 1:00.66. Sophomore 
Ben Howe finished third in 
the event. For the 200-yard 
breaststroke, Seo was able 
to pull out the event placing 
first, with Huber in second 
and sophomore Michael Rong 
finishing third. First-year Kev
in Kuntz said, Clarion had 
some fast swimmers [but] just 
didnt have the depth to win 
the meet.
The Tartans will next be in 
action on Saturday, Nov. 14

Football records 21-13 victory against Washington University
AMANDA WILCZYNSKI

Carnegie Mellon students, 
faculty, staff, and alumni en
joyed Homecoming festivities 
this past week, including the 
Carnegie Mellon University 
football game against Wash
ington University at Gesling 
Stadium on Saturday at 1 p.m. 
The football team opened its 
2009 University Athletic As
sociation (UAA) play with a 
21-13 victory over the Bears. 
The game improved the Tar
tans overall record to 5-3 for 
the season.
After a rainy first half, the 
Tartans found themselves 
trailing 13-0. We started the 
game a little flat, but knew 
that we would find a way to 
turn things around, senior 
Socrates Zacharias said. Tak
ing advantage of the right 
opportunities let us capital
ize to take the lead. The momentum change came when 
[first-year] Sam Thompson 
recovered a fumbled punt in 
the third quarter. Late in the 
third quarter, junior punter 
Richard Pattisons 55-yard 
punt resulted in a fumble 
that Thompson recovered at 
the Washington 10-yard line. 
With his first rushing touch
down of the season, senior 
quarterback Phil Pantalone 
brought the score up to 13-7 
on third and goal on the fouryard line with only 14 sec
onds left in the third.
The strong Tartans de
fense then quickly forced the 
Bears to punt, but a bad snap 
was fumbled and recovered 
by Carnegie Mellon junior 
Tom Todd at the Washington 
17-yard line. Only two plays 
later, senior Andrew Lovrovich brought the Tartans a

The Carnegie Mellon 
mens soccer team suffered its 
first loss in nearly two months 
as they were edged by the 
University of Rochester this 
past Sunday. The game was a 
must win for Rochester, who 
came into the game three 
points behind the University 
Athletic Association (UAA) 
conference leaders, Carnegie 
Mellon. Both teams have also 
shown extremely strong re
cords this year and are ranked 
number 9 (Carnegie Mellon) 
and number 11 (Rochester) in 
the NSCAA/Adidas Division
III Rankings.
From the kickoff, both 
sides came out very aggres
sive as they pushed for the 
crucial first goal. The Tartans 
came very close to scoring 
first as seniors Ricky Griffin 
and Ryan Browne were able 
to connect, but Brownes shot 
was saved by Yellowjacket 
goalkeeper, Michael Peacock. 
Minutes later, Rochester an
swered back as senior mid
fielder Scott Cady scored off a 
crossed ball.
The Tartans continued to 
press for a goal and nearly got 
it in the 35th minute when 
senior forward Pat Lutz mis
timed a pass from senior mid
fielder Keith Haselhoff that 
would have sent him in on a 
clear goal-scoring opportu

The Carnegie Mellon Tar
tans started off the season 
with an impressive perfor
mance on Saturday with the 
mens team winning the meet 
158-136, and despite a good 
fight, the women lost 181-117 
against Clarion University.
The Tartans were able to 
win five events during the 
meet. The womens major 
contributors were junior Mol
ly Evans, who won the 100- 
yard backstroke, 200-yard 
backstroke, and the 200-yard 
individual medley, along with
senior Sara Andrews  who 
won the 200-yard freestyle
 and first-year Dorothy Yu 
winning the 200-yard breast
stroke. Andrews won the 200- 
yard freestyle, just touching 
out Clar;ions Rebecca Burgess 
by 0.04 seconds. Yu was able 
to finish her race with a time 
of 2:26.20, starting out the 
race with a split of a 1:09.86 
and getting a two-second lead 
on the competition.
The womens team placed 
very high in other events as 
well. Yu placed second in the 
100-yard breaststroke, and 
fellow teammate Brenna' Stillo 
touched third in the 100-yard
breaststroke with a personal 
best time of 1:08.95. Sopho
more Victoria Adams raked 
in two second-place finishes 
in the long distance events of 
the 500-yard and 1000-yard 
freestyle.
Junior Brianne Burton 
was able to place third in the 
womens 50-yard freestyle 
with a time of 24.72. To finish 
off the meet, the Tartans fin
ished second in the 200-yard 
freestyle relay with the team 
of Andrews, Stillo, Burton, 
and sophomore Hannah Gon

weekend moves the Tartans 
overall record to 17-11 for the

The team started out their 
game against Elizabethtowri

The Tartans played well for 
their senior night, allowing for 
stunning performances from 
Jess Brackin, Megan Killeen,

digs, and 5 kills by the end of 
the night. For the juniors, Car
oline Size and Cameron Grif
fin Had an impressive game 
to contribute to the Tartans 
win. Size tallied 13 kills in 
the game, and Griffin played 
defensively, leading the team
with 25 digs. Sophomores 
Maddie Rosnick and Emily 
Baddock were also able to re
ceive time in the game, with 
Rosnick tallying 10 kills and 
Baddock receiving 9 digs.
Baddock said that the 
game against Elizabethtown 
Was a little shaky and disor
ganized on our part, and they 
were playing well. However, 
she said she was confident in 
her team: But in the end, we 
were able to come together as 
a team and pull out a win.
For the seniors match on

able to score another win,

Tazza DOro on campus
New coffeeshop to open in Gates Center within two weeks
Everything you need to know
About cleaning up and matchmaking
The new caf opening at the Gates and Hillman 
Centers is more than just coffee  it is going to be 
a fantastic experience in itself. Just when it seemed 
the buzz about the new building was dying down, 
Highland Parks Tazza DOro caf announced its 
opening in the space in less than two weeks. The 
location in the R-Bar Caf on the third floor of the 
Gates Center is definitely a place that one can 
constantly revisit and never get tired of enjoying. - 
The bright colors, comfortable chairs, and open 
spaces are all extremely inviting. The owner, Amy 
Enrico, commented on the cafs mantra in the Jan.
1 issue of the. Pittsburgh City Paper. "The thing 
were good at isnt tangible  it is to create a 
culture and experience around coffee, she said. And 
the caf definitely has an unpretentious charm that 
would be almost impossible to duplicate.
Looking back at what Enrico said, it. is quite clear 
what she meant. She wanted to create a destination, 
a spot in the community  and there are no better 
words to describe Tazza DOro. Based on a few visits 
to the Highland Park coffee shop, it was evident that 
there were some familiar faces, and some new  all 
extremely content with being there.
From people conducting personal tutoring lessons 
to having their first date there, this cafe has had 
several visitors, each of them coming back for more. 
Over the years, the meaning of going for coffee has 
been revolutionized, and it has become all about the 
company you go with, the location, the atmosphere, 
the reason why you are there, and, most definitely, 
the coffee. And Tazza DOro has it all. When you 
visit the Highland Park branch, it is very hard to 
find a vacant seat, and so it is easy to presume that 
those comfy chairs in the Gates Center location will 
definitely be worth fighting for!
The caf offers a wide selection of coffee and 
espresso, delicious paninis (the artichoke and 
tuna or the eggplant are extremely tempting),'

The site for the new caf promises to be a popular 
hangout spot as soon as it opens.
scrumptious biscotti (try the vanilla, it is delicious), 
and cookies (the peanut butter and the chocolate 
chip one can easily become favorites), along with 
several other pastries and Sunday brunch items. It is 
easy to sit for hours with the Sunday brunch menu
 each item available looks mouth-watering.
Try the tasty Pizza Romana from the daily menu. It 
consists of artichoke hearts, prosciutto, kalamata 
olives, sauteed portobello mushrooms, and delicious 
melted fresh mozzarella cheese. Since Enrico insists 
on using locally produced ingredients, the food is 
extremely fresh.
There are a variety of coffees available, from the 
traditional Italian cappuccino to flavored lattes to 
an Americano. The caf also serves cups of the 
Highland Park blend  a dark, smooth, yet sweet 
coffee, made from coffee beans from such parts of 
the world as Africa, South America, and the Middle 
East.
Also available are a wide Selection of over 50 choices 
of herbal teas and regular teas. Making a choice can 
get confusing, so feel free to experiment. The Lychee 
Black tea is extremely unusual and has a sweet 
Asian grape fruit-like flavor, proving the uniqueness 
of the different flavors at this cafe. You should also 
definitely try the Harney & Sons Chocolate mint 
black tea.
Tazza DOro at the Gates and Hillman Centers is 
going to become an ideal location to get homework 
done, catch up with a friend, or simply get away 
from hectic Carnegie Mellon life. Go ahead and try 
one of the to-die-for Italian cappuccinos  theyll 
transport you straight to Italy  along with a 
delicious cookie. After one taste, you will definitely 
be back, fighting for a chair or an open window seat.

Dear Prerna,
I live in a lovely off-campus 
apartment that I used to 
call home, until the attack 
of my roommates. My 
apartment has now 
taken a new shape  
it has become gross, 
with clothes everywhere 
and unwashed dishes
 basically, a living 
disaster. I keep telling my 
roommates to clean, but 
they dont seem to listen 
anymore. I have to clean 
everyday, and it really can 
get tiresome. How do I get 
them just to clean their 
own dishes or just to pick 
up after themselves?
Obsessive Compulsive 
Distressed Roommate
Hey OCDR,
I know exactly how you 
feel: You always want
things to be perfectly clean 
and organizedwhy cant 
everyone around you just feel 
the same way? Well, believe 
me, there are people out 
there who can eat off a dirty 
plate.
Maybe you can set some 
boundaries  request them 
to do whatever they wish 
to their room, but not the 
common area. Just dont 
expect the moon from 
them on day one. Let them 
take it step by step, maybe 
picking up their clothes first, 
then doing the dishes, then 
cleaning up every other 
time. If it still doesnt work, 
ask a neutral friend to speak 
to them and explain the 
situation. Hope it works out; 
after all, cleanliness is next to 
godliness.
Keep it clean,
Prerna
Dear Prerna,
Let me get this out there: I 
am not a bad matchmaker. 
Anyway, I have this friend 
and shes a decent catch, 
so to speak, but she just 
refuses to fall for the boy 
I chose for her. What can 
I do to make her willing 
to see this boy, or at 
least stop thinking .about 
her silly ex and test the 
waters? I think you, giving 
advice like me, might 
understand where I am 
coming from.
-Hitch II 
Dear Hitch II,
Did you know that the original 
Hitch (from the movie Hitch) 
also faced many problems 
while setting people up? First, 
find out why this friend isnt 
willing to forget about her ex
 usually most people try to 
distract themselves with new 
eye candy. Does she still have 
strong feelings for her ex?
Also, most importantly, is this 
new boy worth the effort and 
is he her kind? It must be 
hard enough for her that her 
heart is broken  you dont 
want to put her in a situation 
where it might break again. If 
the new boy is worth it, and 
the ex and your friend are 
definitely not going to work 
out, maybe invite them both 
for lunch and then, suddenly, 
remember that math 
homework that is due in an 
hour! But, remember: You are 
the friend first, matchmaker 
second.
Best of luck,
Prerna

Tales from abroad: London
Experience life in the capital of the United Kingdom: beans on toast, musicals, and parks
My summer in England was perfect. It was a balance 
between high life in London during the weekdays and 
cozy, sunny weekends with family in Reading; what 
more could anyone ask for?
While I was studying at the London School of 
Economics, I lived in a residence hall on High Holborn 
Street. This means that all the restaurants and theaters 
at Covent Garden, or Londons Theatreland, were 
right around the corner. Also, Oxford Circus, the primary 
shopping area in London, was only two 'tube" : the 
colloquial name for Londons subway system  stations 
away.
The first major difference between American and British 
universities that struck me was the visibility of alcohol. 
Even though many college students in U.S. consume 
alcohol, it is mostly under the radar. This might have 
to do with the legal drinking age being 21, unlike in 
England, where it is 18. Even then, not only did the 
LSE campus boast no fewer than three bars, so did 
my residence hall. Every so often, I would find myself 
reading an official e-mail reminding me of the attractive 
offers on beer for the night.
Another difference was the dining. The cafeteria in 
my residence hall would only serve breakfast, and the 
famous English breakfast is a lovely way to start a day.
I enjoyed having breakfast in the cafeteria, not only 
because of the delicious beans on toast, bacon or the 
fresh fruit, but also because of the company. Every
morning I would meet people from some different corner 
of the world, with different stories to tell.
Pick a cuisine and youll find at least one restaurant 
serving it either on Kings way or at Covent Garden. 
Covent Garden, contrary to what the name suggests, 
is not a garden. It is an area in London with lots of - 
entertainment. However, among the tall buildings and 
busy roads, the city pleasantly surprises people with 
parks  small and big. On those rare sunny days, my 
friends and I would get a lunch "take-away from a 
restaurant and enjoy it over great conversation while 
sitting in a park. On the not-so-sunny days, we would 
grab a bite at one of the on-campus pubs and stay warm.
Living in Londons Theatreland," I absolutely had to go 
for a musical. My friends and I went to watch The Lord 
of the Rings. The stage was exquisite and elaborate and 
some pieces of decoration extended beyond the actual 
stage. It could even move to rise and fall to various 
different levels. The performers danced and sang almost 
oblivious to all this movement. Their performances were 
breathtaking, especially Gollum. He crawled over the 
curtain with the ease, flexibility, and grace of a spider. 
The fact that I can clearly remember it after more than a 
year says it all.
Even though I was having fun, sometimes the fast-paced 
city life got overwhelming. So, I would go to Reading
 where my family was for the summer  to relax. 
Reading is a large town about 40 miles west of London.
My family and I rented a boat on a Sunday and had 
a picnic on the river Thames, which flows through 
Reading. It was exciting and challenging to maneuver 
the boat at the lock  a device used to facilitate 
water transport between water on different levels.
The picturesque countryside, the cool breeze, and the 
delicious snacks just made the experience even more 
worthwhile. While in Reading, we also went strawberry 
picking. At the farm, we were each given small baskets 
to collect our picked fruits and vegetables in. We picked 
a lot of strawberries and tasted even more, and also 
picked carrots, broccoli, cabbage, and other berries.
The farm where we were, was also conducting a 
scarecrow decorating competition. The scarecrows were 
impressive, with delicate details. After all this hard work, 
we decided to enjoy some traditional afternoon English 
tea with scones and cream. Needless to say, it was very 
delectable.
There was nothing unfamiliar about England. I am fluent 
in the language that is spoken there and the food and 
transportation was very predictable, so I wasnt pushing 
myself out of my comfort zone. But it was as rewarding 
an experience as any other, and a very memorable 
summer.

Belgian beer in cozy atmosphere
Point Brugge serves up European drinks and delicacies
One of the most exciting things about trying 
different restaurants is finding a hidden gem: a 
restaurant that locals rave about but is still obscure 
enough to retain its original charm. Point Brugge 
is one of those places. Located in the Point Breeze/ 
Homewood neighborhood, the restaurant is modeled 
after the quaint cafs and bistros found across 
Europe. Although it has heavy Belgian influences, 
the menu combines a unique blend of dishes that 
gives something new to order every time.
By far the most popular dish at the restaurant is the 
moules, or mussels, which can be prepared in any 
of three different ways. The customers favorite is 
the classic sauce, made of white wine with shallots, 
hints of garlic, and a little cream. The mussels are 
full of flavor and the sauce adds just enough texture 
without being too overbearing. The moules frites 
come with Point Brugges famous twice-fried french 
fries. The extra time in the fryer crisps the outside, 
and the large, granular salt they are sprinkled with 
makes these fries impossible to stop eating. In a 
gut-busting move, the fries also come with basil 
mayonnaise for dipping. This combination of moules 
and frites proves to be nearly irresistible.
For those who are not fans of shellfish, the menu is 
full of a wide variety of different dishes to choose 
from! The roasted tomato and spinach dip makes 
a great appetizer for the table, and the cold celery 
served with it creates an interesting dynamic when 
dipped into the hot dip. The salted toast is also 
pleasing, as it brings out the full flavor of the dip and 
is sure not to disappoint. Chicken skewers show off 
the more eclectic side of the menu. Grilled over a 
flame and then marinated in a spicy peanut sauce, 
the chicken is tender and the peanut sauce gives a 
little kick at the end of every bite.
Over the past few years, the gourmet burger has 
challenged the countrys top chefs to reinvent a
staple of the American diet while still maintaining 
the emotion of the hamburger. Point Brugge and 
its executive chef Kevin Hunninen have a burger 
to compete. This plump burger, grilled perfectly 
to medium/medium-well, was full of moisture 
and flavor. The Gruyere cheese, lettuce, and 
onions added crunch and texture while the basil 
mayonnaise increased the richness of the burgers 
taste. Add a side of frites to complete the meal.
The restaurant offers both a lunch and a dinner 
menu. The lunch menu features smaller dishes, 
including the moules, as well as salads and a 
nice variety of sandwiches. The steak au jus is a 
lunchtime favorite for customers. The dinner menu 
includes most of the lunch menu, as well as a 
strong list of dinner entrees. The seafood waterzooi
 a soup made from fish  and the carbonnade 
flammande  a Belgian beef stew  are constantly 
coming out of the kitchen to be served to waiting 
customers.
Besides the food, Point Brugge features a fabulous 
beer list. Most of the beer is imported from Belgium, 
as well as the rest of Europe, and it provides a great 
opportunity to sample many different types of beer. 
The Corsendonk Abbey Pale Ale is a light beer 
with a fluity flavor that leaves a pleasant aftertaste. 
The Leffe Blonde is a traditional Belgian beer -with 
its sweet and rich taste. Anyone interested in 
becoming familiar with the various beers of Europe 
would definitely enjoy Point Brugge.
The restaurant is good for dates, for those who love 
to try new kinds of food, and for anyone else that can 
find their way to this location. Prices are reasonable 
and worth the value of the experience.

On apples and kisses
A lot of people say that fall is a nostalgic season, and I 
wholeheartedly agree. In my hometown of Harvard, Mass., 
fall is an important time because it is the season for apples, 
the ubiquitous fruit around town. Phils, Cartons, Doe, ' 
Westward, and Mountain View Orchards all offer their own 
ciders, pies, doughnuts, and various other apple-inspired 
products, along with the standard U-Pick options. We used 
to have the Three Apples Storytelling Festival in the center of 
town. Wed gather in the basement of our church, peeling 
and cutting apples for apple pies that the church would sell 
to raise funds. Because of this, October has always been a 
nostalgic month for me.
I recently read an article on Slate.com about Creed. The 90s 
band is apparently back together, recording and touring. This, 
brought back my memories of the music of the late 90s and 
the early 2000s, back when I was moving through elementary 
and middle school. There was Smash Mouth, with All-Star; 
Creed, with the grunge-ltke guitars and vocals, singing with 
a vaguely Christian message; and, of course, there were the 
Backstreet Boys, *NSYNC, 98 Degrees, et al., of which every 
girl in my grade had a favorite member that they would one 
day marry. But my favorite back then was the Goo Goo Dolls. 
In fact, my first kiss was with a girl named Loren in seventh 
grade, and happened to the strains of Iris. All the seventh 
and eighth graders were in our school cafeteria, dressed up 
for our Snowflake semi-formal. As everyone paired up  
many awkwardly  for the slow dance, I didnt realize how 
prescient the words sooner or later its over would be.
The Three Apples Storytelling Festival moved out of town 
a few years ago. The apples are still there, though Im 10 
hours away throughout peak season. There have been more 
dances, more girls to dance with, and at least a few more 
kisses since then. But Im past that stage. I have a girlfriend 
now, and were going on three years together. Yet, I still think 
back to the cafeteria, back to seventh grade, Loren, and John 
Rzezniks voice saying everythings meant to be broken. It 
was the closest to heaven that Id ever been. And maybe it 
still is. .

A play within a play: Edwin Drood impresses
ScotchnSoda wows audiences with hilarious debut of homecoming musical
Over homecoming weekend, Carnegie Mellons 
independent student theater organization,
ScotchnSoda, debuted their performance of The 
Mystery of Edwin Drood.
Last Friday evening, McConomy Auditorium filled with 
students and alumni alike, all ready and eager to witness 
Scotch'nSoda's opening night. From the moment one 
walked into the theater, it felt like a trip into Victorian 
England. The ticket sellers, the ushers, and everyone 
involved in the event were in character  maintaining 
thick English accents and being exceptionally informal 
with the crowd. As the seats began to fill up, the cast 
members themselves wandered into the audience, 
keeping character in conversations and describing to 
their various sections the voting processes saved for the 
end of the show.
In The Mystery of Edwin Drood, each performer had two 
roles: their primary role as a member of the Music Hall 
Royale traveling theater group, and their secondary role 
as a cast member within the production being performed 
by the Music Hall Royale. In this particular show, the 
misfits of the Music Hall Royale put on a hilariously 
flamboyant rendition of Charles Dickens' final, unfinished 
mystery novel, The Mystery of Edwin Drood.
Dickens' book is set to take place in the fictional city of 
Cloisterham and is narrated and named after an Edwin
Drood (played by senior history major Laura Thorn), 
who tells the story of his uncle and choirmaster John 
Jasper (junior English and philosophy major Nick 
Ryan). Jasper has fallen madly in love with his musical 
pupil and his nephews fiance, Rosa Bud (first-year 
drama major Olivia OConnor). Rosa also catches the 
eye of Droods arch nemesis, Neville Landless (firstyear architecture major Bradley Sherburne), who has 
just moved from Ceylon with his twin sister Helena 
(sophomore BHA student Liz Martindale). The story 
makes for a hilarious love triangle. Suddenly, on 
Christmas Eve, Drood goes missing and audiences 
are left to uncover the murdering culprit behind his 
disappearance.
It was funny, said Ruthie Tane, a first-year in the 
science and humanities scholars program. "The 
audience participation was the best part of the show. By 
the end, we had all worked together to vote the dumbest 
cast member the detective and the holy reverend the 
murderer. It's like everyone was on the same twisted 
page.
The amount of dependency placed on the audience 
truly was one of the most unique aspects about this 
show. The performers encouraged audience members to 
boo and cheer for other troupe members, and with the 
intense level of audience participation and the relaxed, 
friendly atmosphere, it was as if every member of the
audience were playing their own role.
Had one not known, it would have been safe to assume 
that this production was the work of top-notch drama 
majors straight out of Purnell. The music and songs were 
beautiful and seemingly effortless for the performers. 
Each actor did a spectacular job in transforming 
themselves to fit their role. Perhaps most deserving of a 
special mention was Ryan, along with Alex DiClaudio, 
a graduate student in creative enterprise management, 
who played the Chairman.
rAudiences responded particularly well to the comical 
ways of Caitlin Cox: "The actress who played The 
Princess Puffer did a spectacular job, said Alina 
Narvaez, a first-year BHA student. "She was hilarious 
and her voice was so unique. I also thought the actress 
who played Helena Landless [Martindale] did a beautiful 
job with her songs."
Although the show did seem a bit lengthy, it was 
impossible to keep from laughing the whole way 
through. Overall, ScotchnSoda began their year with a 
truly enjoyable performance.

Graves in trees, escaped spirits, and tortured thieves
Rodoreda spins tale about life and death looked at through the eyes of 14-year-old boy
Merc Rodoreda is not alive. She died of cancer in 1983 
and was buried in the cemetery of Romany. However, 
had she been among the characters of her final novel, 
Death in Spring (La Mort i la Primavera), she would 
have been placed in the middle of the villa plaza, on her 
deathbed, where she would have had cement poured _ 
into her mouth till her stomach was full. She then would 
have been interred, not into a hole in the ground, but 
sealed into the carved-out trunk of a still-living tree. This 
was not her fate. But then without this ritual, we can 
believe  as her fictional villagers would have  that 
her soul escaped.
Death inSpring can be read as a novel exploring escape 
- not how to escape, but who and what to escape from. 
Narrated from the point of view of a 14-year-old boy 
who begins the novel witnessing his fathers attempted 
suicide, we are met with a confusing array of violent 
events and descriptions of the beauty and uniqueness of 
the village. While specific events are glossed past in just 
sentences, we are given recurring descriptions of the 
neighing of the horses, the imminent danger and control 
of the river that runs past and underneath the village,
and most frequently the odors that permeate the houses, 
the woods, and the trees in which the dead are encased.
Each of these things  the horses, the smells, the 
river  is meant to be understood symbolically, each 
holding a specific role in the world that exists for these 
villagers. As an example, the village prisoner, once a 
thief, serves for all the crimes of the villagers. Constant 
torture and spectacle lead to his dehumanization  the 
end goal of his punishment. On the day he is declared a 
creature no longer human, he is freed from his cage and 
released to live in the woods. He doesnt disappear into 
the darkness or the past; rather, he remains, befriending 
our boy-narrator and watching over the village people, 
judging them for their own crimes.
Rodoreda is not telling a story of a boy who, after the 
death of his father, takes his step-mother as his wife and 
with her creates a daughter who falls in love with the 
oppressive blacksmiths malnourished son, as uniquely 
imagined as that is; she is capturing a state of mind. Her 
own life and experiences through the Spanish Civil War 
have informed all of her writing, and Death in Spring is
no exception. But this is not a literal account of the war; 
it is an emotional and psychological understanding of 
war and life under totalitarianism, reflecting back after 
.40 years.
We are not given the answers to fixing an unhappy > 
marriage, the death of a parent, or distance from a child, 
nor are we handed solutions for escaping tradition or 
even escaping the pains of adolescence. We are not 
given a story where the best of the villagers unite to 
overthrow a vicious dictator. This novel is just one boys 
account of living life; it is an example that tells us a story: 
a beautiful and evocative and viscerally bloody story 
about life and death.

The Hurt Locker
Thursday, Nov. 5 
7:30 10 12:30
This war thriller about an elite army 
explosives disposal unit has received 
widespread acclaim and has won 
many awards. Written by a freelance 
writer who experienced being in 
a bomb squad in Iraq, the film is 
highly realistic. The plot follows a 
group of men as they struggle to 
survive in a world where everyone 
is a potential threat and everything 
is a potential weapon. Its a gripping 
movie that explores a personal side 
to war that war movies nowadays 
dont always show. Fun fact: With so 
many Americans filming just outside 
Iraq, the Jordanian military had to be 
stationed near the production sets.
Public Enemies
Friday, Nov. 6 
10 12:30
In Public Enemies, we are told 
the mostly true story of FBI agent 
Melvin Purvis as he attempts to 
take down three of the most wellknown gangsters in American history, 
including John Dillinger. Christian Bale 
and Johnny Depp portray Purvis and 
Dillinger respectively, as each attempts 
to outwit the other in a bloody game of 
cat and mouse. The film was received 
well by critics and moviegoers alike, 
making almost $200 million during its 
theatrical run. If you like shoot-outs, 
old-fashioned clothes, or just have a 
cruSh on Depp or Bale, this is certainly 
the flick for you.

The Birds
Saturday, Nov. 7 
7:30 10 12:30
Director Alfred Hitchcock strikes just 
the right nerves again in what is one of 
his best-known suspense films. In this 
particular film, the titular birds begin 
attacking, for reasons unknown, a small 
San Francisco-area town, causing the 
inhabitants to flee in terror. In a time 
when such movies were not the norm, 
The Birds was noted as being quite 
scary and original, much like most .of 
Hitchcocks work. (Not so) fun fact: Star 
Tippi Hedren reportedly had a disastrous 
on-set relationship with Hitchcock, and 
went so far as to act in the horrendous 
sequel, The Birds II: Land's End, purely 
out of spite.
Dead Snow
Sunday, Nov. 8 
8 10 12
This is the cream of the crop in the 
genre of Norwegian horror zombie 
comedy films  you heard me right. 
In a plot straight from a modification 
of Call of Duty, medical students are 
horrified to find that their relaxing ski 
vacation has turned into a battle of 
life or death as they attempt to avoid 
massive hordes of zombie Nazis, 
and trust me, those are absolutely 
the worst kind of zombies out there. 
Fans of unnecessary blood and 
gore will be delighted to hear that 
critics everywhere noted how the film 
unwittingly beats every single horror 
cliche to a bloody stump of a pulp. 
See it, unless youre chicken.

Station Square offers great night life
Hop on the Carson Loop bus for an exciting evening with friends or a romantic date
J by Shweta Suresh j Pillbox Editor J
While it may seem that Pittsburgh doesnt have 
very much to offer when it comes to dining and 
entertainment, it is actually quite the opposite. Areas 
that are looked upon as the cultural hubs of the city 
were not very accessible to the student population until 
a semester ago, but these places  namely, Station 
Square and SouthSide Works  have now been opened 
up to Carnegie Mellon students through a great service 
called the Carson Loop bus.
For those who are still unaware, the Loop bus is a service 
that was started by Student Government last semester 
to encourage students to discover other Pittsburgh 
neighborhoods. The bus leaves from the UC turnaround 
on Friday and Saturday evenings and makes stops at 
Station Square, different streets in the South Side, and 
then, true to its name, loops back to Carnegie Mellon. 
The departures are frequent and convenient enough 
for students to enjoy a great night out at any of these 
locations.
Station Square is one of the most culturally alive areas 
in Pittsburgh and demands a visit. Peppered with great 
restaurants, steeped with unique history, and known 
for great nightlife, this part of the city provides visitors 
with a true Pittsburgh experience. Read on to find out 
what the places have to offer and what you might be 
interested in visiting while you're there.
A Romantic Evening
Station Square provides the perfect setting for an 
intimate but fdn date with your love interest. From 
_taking a scenic ride down the three rivers of Pittsburgh 
to catching a glimpse of the city's breathtaking skyline at 
night, Station Square offers a number of diverse options 
for the perfect date.
The Inclines
People always say great things about the New York 
skyline, but Pittsburghs skyline is something else 
altogether. Although missing national landmarks like 
the Empire State Building, the city offers a different 
view because of its location on the confluence of three 
rivers. The bright lights of buildings and bridges make 
this view more than memorable  and catching a 
glimpse of it is made easy because of the Duquesne and 
Monongahela Inclines situated at Station Square.
These inclines are a cable-powered means of 
transportation that were historically used to travel 
between the river valleys and the hilltops. Today, they 
survive as a service for Mount Washington residents 
and for visitors to who wish to view the Pittsburgh 
panorama. As the inclines are a part of the Port Authority 
transportation system, their use is free for all Carnegie 
Mellon students upon showing a college ID. So go ahead 
and take a free ride up Mount Washington to catch a 
glimpse of the 'Burgh by night.
Clippership Cruises
Many Carnegie Mellon students went on a Clippership 
cruise during Orientation week  or at least those who 
opted not to go for Casino Night did, but experiencing 
it the first time with a bunch of people you just met 
and going again with a close set of friends or your love 
interest is entirely different.
The cruise offers a chance for passengers to view 
Pittsburgh by night  and theres no better way to 
witness it than while sailing on the rivers. Passengers 
have the option of taking a dinner cruise and eating a 
delicious meal while making their way around the city, 
or taking a sight-seeing cruise during the day and noting 
all the famous landmarks and monuments.
Horse and carriage rides
With winter coming our way, theres nothing more 
romantic than snuggling up in a horse-drawn carriage 
and experiencing the first snowfall while taking a ride 
around Station Square. Get the feeling of being a part 
of old-world America through this experience. For more 
information about times of the carriage rides and prices, 
call 412.913.0664.

from Station Square and sails on the three rivers of Pittsburgh.

Grab a Bite
Enjoy a great Friday night out on the town with a group 
of friends by having a nice dinner at one of the great 
restaurants Station Square has to offer. With options 
ranging from the classic Italian meal to delicious fondue, 
the following are some places that are worth stopping by.
Buca di Beppo
If you're going with a big group of people, this Italian 
restaurant is a great place to dine. The service is friendly, 
and the menu has many classic favorites, such as the 
bruschett, that are delicious options to start with. The 
cheese manicotti is a great entree, and combines a 
creamy Alfredo sauce with a chunky marinara perfectly. 
The baked ravioli is also a good option for cheese 
lovers, as it combines melted mozzarella and parmesan 
cheeses. Keep in mind that the serving sizes are pretty 
large, so feel free to share!
The Melting Pot
Just as the restaurants tagline says, The Melting Pot 
is a great place to "dip into something different. This 
delicious fondue restaurant is a great place to go, 
especially if youre craving cheese or chocolate. The 
Melting Pot serves up different varieties of delicious 
cheese fondue and great options to dip into your cheese. 
Try the Wisconsin Trio, a blend of different cheeses, 
white wine, sherry, and scallions, or go for. something 
simple with Cheddar Cheese, a mix of sharp cheeses, 
lager beer, garlic, and seasonings. Bowls of bread pieces, 
fresh vegetables, and apple quarters provide the perfect 
complements to the cheese fondue.
Communal cooking is a big part of this restaurant, so 
you can try an entree in which youre given all the 
ingredients and you can cook it yourself! Plates of meat 
and vegetables are provided with a boiling pot of broth, 
so customers choose what theyd like to try, season it, 
and enjoy their meal the way they prefer.
But, of course, if chocolate is what you're craving then 
just stop by this restaurant for some dessert. Customers 
can pick between dark, white, or milk chocolate fondue 
and can also opt for sWirl-ins like caramel and Oreo 
pieces. The chocolate fondue comes with a plate of 
fresh strawberries, cheesecake, bananas, pound cake, 
brownies, Oreo cookies, and marshmallows. Needless to 
say, this selection is all you need-to get an instant sugar 
high.
Hard Rock Cafe
Everyones favorite international chain has a branch 
at Station Square. Stop by Hard Rock Cafe to enjoy 
some great food, the great atmosphere, and to have an 
all-around relaxing evening out. The caf hosts some 
interesting musical events and concerts that are worth 
a visit, so listen to some local Pittsburgh bands or watch 
your favorite singers play when they come into town.
Station Square has a lot more to offer in terms of dining 
and nightlife, and all that's necessary to discover more 
is a little exploring and, of course, getting on the Loop. 
The restaurants are more on the expensive side of the 
student budget, but you can make a trip to Station 
Square a special night out with your close friends.

Tips on how and where to shop online
As the saying, "time is gold, goes, people want 
to use time as efficiently as possible, and being 
students at Carnegie Mellon, we are no exception. 
Among the many advantages that the Internet 
gives us, one of the most important ones is online 
shopping  one of the best ways to save time. The 
Internet is open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year; and 
you dont have to worry about finding a parking spot. 
Tiffany Barth, a senior chemical engineering major, 
commented on the facility. "Time is the main reason 
I shop online; I have no time to actually go out 
shopping, she said. Here are some websites where 
you can get some fashionable pieces.
Bluefly.com
Based in New York City, Bluefly offers a wide variety 
of items, ranging from clothes to jewelry. This site 
often features designers such as Marc Jacobs and 
Diane von Fiirstenberg at discount prices. Due to the 
sites wide selection of items, it might be easier if 
you have a specific item in mind before you shop.
Shopbop.com
At this website, customers are able to shop by 
brand, trend, exclusives, and even discount (30, 50, 
or 70 percent off). This nine-year-old site features 
hip finds from the likes of Anna Sui and Alexander 
Wang. Keep an eye out for the sale season, because 
they offer good deals on designer clothing. Another 
incentive for shopping at Shopbop.com is that it 
provides free ground shipping anywhere in the 
United States, so it doesnt cost you that extra 
money.
Zappos.com
Established in 1999, Zappos specializes in footwear. 
In addition to this, it offers clothing and bags for 
sale. Zappos offers free shipping, a 365-day return 
policy, and 24/7 customer service. If you don't like 
the product, it is really easy to return or exchange it.
Topshop.com
Youve probably heard about this famous Londonbased brand that just recently opened a store in 
SoHo. However, you dont have to go to New York 
to get Topshops fashionable clothes. The website 
carries hip and chic pieces that get shipped right 
to your doorstep. Look out for trendy jackets and 
sweaters for this fall  you can definitely add a 
European touch to your wardrobe.
Modcloth. com
Modcloth is based in Pittsburgh and was established 
in 2001 by Susan and Eric Kroger, recent Carnegie 
Mellon graduates. Modcloth offers a good deal on 
vintage clothing and also has dresses that are very 
fashionable  either retro-chic or floaty, ethereal, 
Bohemian sheers..Many of the pieces are available 
for under $100. The store also offers hip accessories.

Tiffany Barth, a frequent online shopper, wears a 
brightly colored scarf.
While online shopping is a big time saver, there 
are some shared concerns about it. Because you 
cannot try on the clothes, you can never actually 
know how they are going look on you. Esra Aras and 
Yasemin Silahtaroglu, first-year architecture majors, 
commented that they never know what size to order. 
So here are few tips about shopping online.
Check the shipping and return policy
Always check the return policy before you purchase 
an item. Since you cannot try it on until it actually 
arrives, it is safer to have a flexible return policy.
This way, you can return or exchange the item if you 
don't like it.
Read the buyers reviews
Reading other buyers' comments can give you a 
good sense about the quality of the product. It can 
tell you a lot about sizes, too: if the product runs true 
to its size or a bigger one. However, be careful if 
there are only a few reviews, because it can give you 
a biased view toward the product.
Save the shipping fee
Often, online stores will offer free shipping if you 
spend a certain amount of money on their products. 
If you are only planning to buy one product, however, 
and the shipping fee is expensive, consider asking 
other friends who are interested in buying products 
from the same website to purchase things together.

You will discover that you have the ability to control the weather, but only 
while you are enclosed in a sensory deprivation chamber.
Any productivity you may have had this week is completely lost when 
you decide to try and compute your personal Kevin Bacon number.
You agree with Kermit when he says, It aint easy bein green. 
Fortunately, your verdant coloration is beneficial, a result of a genetic 
mutation that causes your skin cells to create chlorophyll.
Now would be an auspicious time to ask your crush to go on a date. 
Ten-ton beluga whales are particularly romantic this time of year.
The stars arent quite sure how, but you will manage to ruin everything 
good in your life this week. Unfortunately, there are no signs of 
recovery.
No matter how hard you try, you cannot get a hedgehog and a guinea 
pig to cross-breed. Though the result would be terrifyingly cute, theyre 
just not that into each other.
Despite the fact that you strategically circled the day on the communal 
wall calendar, nobody notices your birthday. Better luck next year.
You will wake up with a sore throat and an affinity for swine fl. For your 
information: Swine flu is not as delicious as swine.
This week, you will begin to emit an electromagnetic field that keeps 
your cell phone charged forever, but gives everyone around you 
goosebumps.
You will begin having a recurring nightmare that involves the fundamental 
theorem of calculus, Gottfried Leibniz, and pineapples. Any attempt to 
explain this to another person is completely futile.
Your idea for the next Great American Novel is actually just a long list 
of strange city names in the Midwest. You will get about 50 pages in 
before the names just become depressing.
