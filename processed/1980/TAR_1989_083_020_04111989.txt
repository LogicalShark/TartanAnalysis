By JENNIFER BANNAN
Tartan Staffwriter
The first week of March this year will 
remain in Christie Nolls memory for a 
long time to come. That week she was 
picked as a performer in the Civic Light 
Opera at the Benedum Center, which 
means shell be receiving her equity card 
 a must for any actor who wants to work 
professionally.
But to make the week better, Noll was 
notified that she had been chosen as a 
Time College Achievement Award Winner.
Noll, a singer, dancer, and actress at 
. CMU, seems a bit overwhelmed by her 
recent success. What Ive done hasnt 
seemed like a big deal to me. Its what I like 
to do.
Time and Volkswagen sponsored the 
nationwide search for outstanding college 
juniors. The companies sent applications 
to every college in the country, and over 
winter break, the colleges sent applica
tions to particularly outstanding students.
Noll spent a week, making tapes of her 
singing, writing an essay, and asking profssors to write recommendations. She sent 
out the application and her working re
sum inrIate January.
There were thirty honorable mentions 
and twenty winners. Noll won in the cate
gory of the individual who strives for per
fection,. and develops a talent/skill that 
requires perseverance, constant practice 
.and total dedication.
Awards went to others for improving 
cross-cultural understanding, improving 
the plight of specific groups, contributing 
to society through the written word,

present Cyert with 
petition, letter
'Make center top priority
By STEWART LEVINE
Tartan Contributing Editor
Student leaders presented 
Carnegie Mellon President Rich
ard Cyert with an appeal for the 
stalled University Center and a 
petition signed by about 2000 
members of the campus commu
nity last week.
After Cyerts address to the stu
dent body last month, Student 
Government President Andy Robitshek organized the leaders of 
campus organizations to provide 
a unified student response to 
Cyert.
At the same time, Robitshek 
and H&SS Senator Carlos Franco
started a petition drive to solicit 
support for the Center.
I asked a group of student 
leaders to meet and decide what 
we should do about the Univer
sity Center, explained Robitshek.
Over the course of three meet
ings, the group decided to draft a 
letter to Cyert expressing their 
concerns. Tartan Editor-In-Chief 
Karl Barnhart and H&SS Sena
tor and Student Union Non-Editor Matt Ruben were chosen to 
write the letter.
Both seemed surprised with the 
pairing and resulting partnership. 
Originally Barnhart volunteered 
to write the draft, but during the

On March 20, the Office of Civil 
Rights of the U.S. Department of 
Education notified Carnegie Mel
lon that it has been cleared of dis
crimination charges filed by 
Suresh Deman.
Deman, a native of India, ap
plied for admission to SUPA, 
GSIA, and the Department of Sta
tistics between February 23 and 
March 31, 1988, but was not ac
cepted by any of the three CMU
graduate programs.
Deman charged he was denied 
admission on the basis of discrimi
nation against Asian-Americans 
and filed a complaint with the 
U.S. Department of Education.
Schools which receive federal 
funds are prohibited by federal 
law from denying admission on 
the basis of race, color, or na
tional origin. Approximately ten 
percent of CMUs student body is 
Asian-American.

A mock arraignment and 
preliminary hearing for an ac
quaintance rape case were acted 
out in the Mudge lounge last 
Thursday as part of a weeklong series of womens issues 
events.
The case was that of Lisa, a 
female college student who stops 
by the apartment shared by a 
female friend and her friends 
22-year-old brother, Paul. When 
Lisa arrives, Paul tells her that 
his sister is out but may be back 
soon. He invites Lisa to wait
and she accepts. After a period of 
conversation, Paul allegedly rapes 
Lisa.
The program began with an 
arraignment in which the judge, 
played by District Justice Dennis 
Joyce, informed Paul of the charge 
against him. He also set a pre
liminary hearing date and set bail 
at $50,000. The part of Paul was 
played by sophomore resident 
assistant Walt Schearer.
The preliminary hearing fol
lowed immediately. Joyce ex
plained that a preliminary hear
ing is used to determine whether 
the commonwealth has enough of 
a case to go to trial. It also serves
to give the defendant some idea 
of the case against him.
In contrast to the situation at 
a trial, any doubt at the end of 
a preliminary hearing is decided 
in favor of the state and the 
case is sent to trial. The judge 
will only dismiss the case if 
there is no reasonable evidence 
that the defendant is guilty.
Even if the case is dismissed, 
the charges can be re-filed later 
if more evidence comes to light, 
because double jeopardy does 
not apply to preliminary hear
ings.

The Student Presidential Search 
Committee will formally present a 
draft of its white paper this after
noon at an open forum meeting sched
uled for 3:30 pm in the Adamson Wing. 
The forum is sponsored by the faculty 
search committee, which is also pre
senting its report.
As stated in its introduction, the 
white paper is a summary of prob
lems which the new president must 
tackle if Carnegie Mellon is to become 
a first-class, internationally renowned 
university.
The report, which will be given to 
the finalists in the search, is divided 
into three sections  academic con
cerns, quality of life concerns, and 
presidential responsibilities.
According to acting chair Kimberly 
McGraw, the purpose of the forum is 
to solicit student opinion about the 
report before the final draft is writ

reports on 
sensitivity
By MICHAEL EWEDOSH
Tartan Staffwriter
On Tuesday, April 4, the University released three 
documents regarding campus sensitivity. The docu
ments were in response to protests by black student 
leaders of insensitivity and harassment.
The first of the three documents was a statement 
from President Richard Cyert entitled Striving for 
Mutual Respect in the Pluralistic Society at Carnegie 
Mellon.
It was followed by a summary of actions already 
taken and planned to deal with minority concerns and 
campus sensitivity.
The third document in the package was a report 
from Campus Security that addressed the issues of 
racial sensitivity and awareness and that outlined 
Security policies and programs to address those is
sues.
Spirit President Nicole Austin was pleased with the 
reports. Theyre pretty in-depth, she said. I think 
that theyre good attempts at dealing with these prob
lems.
Austin said she was satisfied that the University 
produced a report that dealt with the issues. How
ever, she emphasized that she was still unhappy with 
the racial tensions and unsolved problems that re
main on campus. They have to put the ball into 
motion, she said. She made it clear that black stuJunionrCh un steC w

Thatcher charges 
Gorbachev with 
weapons deceit
LONDON (AP)A spokesman 
for British Prime Minister Mar
garet Thatcher said that Thatcher 
and Soviet President Mikhail 
Gorbachev had extremely frank 
exchanges in Gorbachevs first 
visit to a NATO country since the 
earthquake in Armenia.
Separately, British and Soviet 
foreign ministers, Sir Geoffrey 
Howe and Eduard Shevardnadze, 
signed memorandums of under
standing to ease travel restric
tions between the two countries 
and boost British investment in 
the Soviet Union.
They also signed an agreement 
for British contractors to build a 
$7 million school in the Armenian 
city of Leninakan.
The spokesman said Thatcher 
asked Gorbachev about a report 
from Washington that Moscow 
sold up to 15 long-range fighterbombers to Libya, which Britain 
accuses of sponsoring terrorism.
Gorbachev did not respond.
Thatcher challenged Gor
bachevs goal of eliminating all 
nuclear weapons from Europe and
accused the Soviets of having 
been not as frank as they should 
be about their chemical weapons 
arsenal.

1989 parody issue delayed
By HOWDY PIERCE
Tartan News Editor
The 1989 version of The Natrat, 
The Tartans annual April Fools 
Day parody, has been postponed 
because The Tartans regular 
printer would not print it.
The Natrat  which was to 
have been distributed on campus 
last Tuesdaywas delayed when 
' Western Pennsylvania Printing 
refused to print the issue after 
seeing the boards produced in 
The Tartan office.
We dont know why they re
fused to print it, said Tartan Editor-in-Chief Karl Barnhart. We 
didnt think it was objectionable.
I was advised that we couldnt 
1 print the issue, but I have no 
comment as to why, said Bill 
Diller of West Penn. We dont
want to try to edit The Tartan. Its 
[the papers] right to print what
ever it wants to print. But as a 
printer, its our right also to ac
cept what we feel we should print. 
West Penn has printed The 
Tartan since the beginning of the 
current school year. It is not under 
contractual obligation to print The 
Natrat.
The Tartan editorial board was 
willing to make some changes in 
content of The Natrat, but nego
tiations with the printer were 
unable to produce a solution by 
Friday.
The Tartan has the option of 
changing the content of the issue, 
taking it to another printer, or 
deciding not to print it at all.
At press time, the editorial 
board had not decided the issues 
fate.
Alaska knew of 
poor oil spill 
response ability
NEW YORK (DJ)  Confiden
tial state records accuse Alyeska 
Pipeline Service Co. of so badly 
managing its oil spill response 
capabilities over the years that 
they were once described as hav
ing regressed to a dangerous 
level.
Correspondence between Alas
kan and federal conservation offi
cials also makes it clear that state 
and federal agencies were aware 
of the potential problems but were 
unable, or unwilling, to step in 
and intervene.
Ironically, the state of Alaska 
has been the most strident critic 
of Alyeskas inability to contain 
the recent 240,000-barrel spill in 
Prince William Sound; yet these 
documents show that the state,
along with federal agencies, 
shares culpability in the largest
oil spill in U.S. history.
Friday, Alyeskas three major
oil company owners, responding 
to rising criticism, said they had 
instituted a series of measures, 
including mandatory random 
drug and alcohol searches of all 
ships using Valdez port, designed 
to prevent accidents and quicken 
spill clean-up.
The action, by units of Exxon 
Corp., Atlantic Richfield Co., and 
British Petroleum Co., may also 
have come in response to another 
threat yesterday by Alaska Gov
ernor Steve Cowper to shut down 
the pipeline if Alyeska and Exxon 
do not improve their ability to 
contain future spills.
Alyeska, hampered by severe 
equipment and manpower short
ages, was unable to muster a quick 
response to the grounding of the 
supertanker Exxon Valdez on 
March 24.
Bush opposes car 
safety proposals
WASHINGTON (AP)  The

Congress that it is continuing

In testimony that he said had 
been cleared by the Bush admini
stration, a top official of the Na
tional Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration told a Senate 
subcommittee that his agency 
opposes legislation that would 
require the government to rap
idly adopt new safety standards.
Barry Felrice, the agencys 
associate administrator for rulemaking, told the Senate Com

impose for adopting many of the
new safety rules, and that it woul 
oppose deadlines of any length.

New orientation program replaces Freshman Camp
By KARL BARNHART
Tartan Editor-in-Chief
Student Affairs will select the 
remaining 33 counselors later this 
week for freshman retreat, a pro;gram designed to replace fresh
man camp and to be integrated 
into freshman orientation, accord
ing to Dean of Student Affairs 
Braden Walter.
Freshman camp was re-evaluhted because Vice President for 
/Enrollment William Elliott 
wanted to give all the freshmen 
the same orientation. If we are 
going to have a camp experience, 
-it should be worthwhile for the 
whole freshman class, said Elli'ptt. Orientation should be an ex
perience that prepares students 
,to make the most out of their
I think they are 
biting off more 
than they can 
chew this year. 
 Stewart Levine
years at Carnegie Mellon.
Since many students didnt go 
to camp, administrators felt that 
orientation bred two separate 
groups of students, segregating 
the campus.
Moved from Camp Lutherlyn 
in Prospect, Penn., the retreat 
will run August 26 and 27after 
on-campus orientationat Heri
tage Reservation, a Boy Scout
camp 14 miles east of Uniontown, Penn. Unlike freshman 
camp, freshman retreat will be a 
part of orientation, funded from 
one umbrella orientation fee.
Retreat counselors will come 
back to campus for training Au
gust 19 and freshmen will report 
to campus August 23, 24, and 25 
for on-campus orientation before 
being bussed to the retreat. In the 
past, freshmen who wanted to go 
to camp came to campus the 
weekend before required oncampus orientation and then were 
bussed to Camp Lutherlyn.
Every freshman will be charged 
around $130 for orientation, 
which includes the retreat. 
Though the retreat is not required, 
Walter expects nearly all of the 
1200 incoming freshmen to par
ticipate; normally around 700 
students participate in camp.
Despite this increase in stu
dents, counselors have been 
slashed from around 90 to only 
36. Six CQunselors will act as 
executive counselors, respon
sible for coordinating the other 30 
counselors.
To complement the counselors, 
Walter wants to use resident as
sistants at camp, especially RAs 
who will have freshman floors 
after camp.
Last year, we needed more 
counselors because they were 
broken up into two different 
groups: one that stayed on cam
pus and one that went to camp, 
said Walter. This year we want 
all the counselors to go to camp 
along with some RAs and some
faculty members. We want to give 
the freshmen as much individual 
attention as possible.
Amy Ginther, the assistant 
director of housing, said she wel
comes the increased role that RAs 
will have in the retreat. We are 
still working on who and how 
many RAs we will send to the 
retreat, she said. But we recog
nize [the retreatl as an important 
couple of days and want to be 
involved as much as we can. 
Though most of the counselors 
will be named by Friday, three of 
the six primary counselors have 
already been appointed. They are 
Stewart Levine, first-year GSIA 
grad student; Janine Bodio, jun
ior design major; and C.J. Warner, 
junior mathematics major. 
Bodio, however, isnt sure
whether she will be a counselor. 
If I do it, I will be one the six staff 
members, said Bodio, But I 
havent decided if Im going to do 
it or not.
Levine, who is definitely going 
to be a counselor, is worried that 
freshmen wont receive the indi
vidual attention they need with 
only 36 counselors. The ratio of 
students to counselors will be 25 
to one, said Levine, We dont 
even try to have recitation classes 
with ratios that high. Last years 
camp had a 12 to one ratio.
In addition, Levine feels that 
too many changes are being made 
to camp in one year. In the long 
run, camp will probably be bet
ter, he said, But I think they are 
biting off more than they can chew 
this year.
Sophomore Roston receives NEH grant
By TERENCE SPIES
Tartan Staffwriter
1 The National Endowment for the 
Humanities has selected sophomore 
(Marc Roston as an NEH Younger Scholar 
for 1989. Roston is an Economics/Policy 
Management double major in H&SS.
Roston was selected in a nationwide 
competition of high school and college 
Jstudents who submitted proposals for 
independent summer research projects 
in history, literature, philosophy, for
eign languages, and other humanities 
disciplines.
Roston, who lives in Wilmette, Illinois, 
is one of 91 college students and 66 high 
school students to win NEH Younger 
Scholar awards for 1989. Winners of this
years awards were selected from 724 
eligible applicants representing48 states, 
the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.
Under the guidance of Dr. Lynn Eden, 
assistant professor of sociology and his
tory, Roston will use the NEH grant of 
$2,200 to work on a project entitled, 
Competing Economic Ideas in the Shap
ing of U.S. Foreign Economic Policy 
Under President Wilson.
At the end of the summer, Roston is 
expected to submit a substantial research 
paper and final narrative report on the 
nine-week project.'
Roston chose his topic based on his 
long-term interest in economics. I didnt 
feel confident researching pure econom
ics, so I chose an interdisciplinary topic, 
he said.
Roston plans to concentrate on the 
comparison of the decision processes and 
economic issues involved in the Ameri
can European reconstruction programs 
after World War I and World War II.
Students from other schools will be 
doing NEH research on topics such as 
Antigone, modern drama, the history of 
Congress, biblical literature and Martin 
Luther King, Jr.
The NEH Younger Scholars program 
offers high school and college students a 
unique opportunity for intensive, inde
pendent study in the humanities, said 
NEH chairman Lynne V. Cheney in an
nouncing the awards. We are impressed 
by the scholarly potential and intellec
tual curiosity reflected in the projects 
proposed by this years winners.
Eirene, Forsythe jailed one month
By JAMES B. ENDRES
Tartan Assistant News Editor
'i Software Engineering Institute (SEI) 
protestor Vincent Eirene was re-arrested 
March 22 for refusal to pay a $200 fine he 
deceived for a December 10 arrest. 
'Eirenes associate, Kevin Forsythe, was 
arrested March 25. Both men have been 
'sentenced to one month in jail.
Eirene and Forsythe had staged a 
'Grand Closing of SEI protest last De
cember on the first anniversary of SEIs 
Opening. They were arrested for disor
derly conduct after they chained shut 
athe doors of the building.
Eirene and Forsythe became subject to 
re-arrest on February 10, but appar
ently their warrants were not processed 
for over a month.
In a telephone interview from Al
legheny County Jail, Eirene claimed that 
he had been interrogated by the police 
after he was arrested. The guy asked 
me, in Russian, if I spoke Russian. I 
didnt know what he was talking about. 
He asked me if I was a Communist. Then 
he asked me who trained me.
Eirene claims that because he refused 
to answer any questions, he was put into 
what he called Murderers Range, the 
maximum-security block of the jail. This
has just become the dumping ground for 
the unwanted.
Eirene said that he would be released 
if he paid the fine, but that he refuses to 
do so. Im in here with guys who have 
thirty years and life, and theyre just 
amazed that I wont pay the fine.
The Pittsburgh Police Department was 
unable to provide information about 
Eirenes arrest.
A spokesperson for the Allegheny 
County Jail told The Tartan that it was 
the wardens policy never to release any 
information about inmates.
An open letter from Eirene to CMU 
students appears in the Forum section.

quet was held in their honor.
Why am I here? Noll remem
bers thinking. I havent done 
anything with DNA.
In the May 22 issue of Time 
there will be a two-page spread 
on the twenty winners. Each sub
sequent week there will be a full 
page about each winner. Noll 
says she thinks it may be time to
get a subscription.
Noll may have felt humble 
among the other winners, but 
she has plenty to be proud of. 
She has been performing since 
the age of four, is an active 
member of the Jazz Choir and 
Gospel, has performed at Opryland and has worked extensively 
in community theater.
Now that she has landed a job 
with the Civic Light Opera, Noll 
will receive her equity card and 
therefore have a head start on 
most actors fresh out of college.
An equity card means an actor 
can audition for any show in 
which he or she wants a part, 
rather than having to wait for 
the rare open audition.
When Noll was being intro
duced at the banquet in New
York, she could hardly believe 
all the achievements being an
nounced were her own. To hear 
everything Ive done from some
body whos not directly involved 
in my life is a great feeling.
Noll remembers taking the 
stand after being introduced and 
saying, Id like to thank the acad
emy ... She caught herself and 
thought, No, wait. That comes 
later.
Noll feels that being sur
rounded by so many outstand
ing people has put her in per
spective. I know where I am and 
how small CMU is, she says.
For now, shes concentrating 
on her future career: Im the 
product that Im trying to sell. I 
need to make myself as solid and 
marketable as possible.

The draft of the paper high

Approximately four hundred 
copies of the draft, which was 
completed before Spring Break, 
have been distributed around 
campus. According to McGraw, 
copies were placed in Porter and 
Doherty Halls, the Skibo Infor
mation Desk, and the libraries.
Copies were also given to the 
faculty committee.

draft was pre

Friday. The reac

McGraw. Im sure

The committee was scheduled 
to meet yesterday to discuss its 
role during the rest of the search. 
The faculty definitely supports 
us in being a part of the interview 
process, but they are not in a 
position of power to make a commitment, says Roston.
The committee was established 
in January to write the white 
paper when President Cyert 
publicly announced his intention 
to retire after the 1989-90 aca
demic year.
The committee got off to a slow 
start when Student Senate ob
jected to the mix of students ini
tially selected by Robitshek. A 
compromise was reached and new 
members of the committee were 
selected.
Other members of the Student 
Search Committee, which in
cludes both graduate and under
graduate students, are Ingrid 
Bromberg, Doug Cervenak, Car

Kluge, Tamal Mukherjee,

actors had been given details of 
the alleged rape to allow them to 
play their parts, but there was no 
set script and the participants 
improvised their lines as they 
went along.
Under questioning from the 
prosecutor, played by assistant 
district attorney James Lomeo, 
Lisa, played by senior RA Amy 
Howes, testified that Paul had 
forced himself on her, first kiss
ing her and then, despite strong 
opposition, ripping off her clothes 
and raping her. When Paul went 
to the bathroom afterwards she 
left and ran back to her dorm 
room.
Her roommate, played by so
phomore RA Shari Miller, con
firmed that Lisa came home very 
upset and eventually told her that 
she had been raped by Paul.
Pauls attorneys, public defend
ers Ann Mehalko and Rita Yake, 
cross-examined both witnesses 
and then called Paul to the stand 
to give his side of the story. Joyce 
told the audience that the defen
dant normally would not testify
at a preliminary hearing but the 
participants had agreed that he 
should do so in this case for in
structional purposes.
Paul testified that Lisas story 
was, for the most part, true and 
admitted that he had sex with 
Lisa. However, he said that even 
though Lisa was tense when he 
first kissed her, she did not resist 
him and consented to everything 
that happened.
After the attorneys gave their 
closing statements, Joyce opened 
the floor for questions from the 
audience. The roughly ten stu
dents present asked the attor
neys and Joyce a wide range of 
questions about the strategies 
used in trying rape cases and 
various points of law relating to 
rape.
At the end of the program, Joyce 
asked the audience members 
whether they would have sent 
the case to trial. The consensus of 
the audience was that they would 
have. Joyce confirmed the opin
ion by saying that if such a case 
came before him, he would also 
send it to trial.

eluded that the University did 
not violate these federal laws. In 
an investigation by the federal 
government, it was found that 
Demans GRE scores were lower 
than all admitted students and 
that the three programs at CMU 
had legitimate academic reasons 
for denying Deman admission.
Deman was previously enrolled 
at the University of Pittsburgh, 
where he was expelled in Janu
ary, 1988. He filed complaints of
discrimination against Pitt with 
the Equal Employment Opportu

dents would not rest easy until 
[they] see changes starting to be 
implemented.
Michael Bowman, Spirits Ex
ecutive Vice President, echoed 
Austins satisfaction with the 
report. As a report, it was satis
factory, he said. [It was] the 
first step  the University ac
knowledged the problem. The 
second step is the University 
taking some action and imple
menting changes concerning 
these issues.
The three documents were in
troduced by a memorandum from 
Vice President for Enrollment 
William F. Elliott which reaf
firmed Carnegie Mellons commit
ment to creating a community in 
which all members'are free to 
pursue intellectual and personal 
>als.
Cyerts statement called upon 
the campus community to serve 
as a model for the larger society. 
Cyert said that he considers it es
sential to show that educated 
people  the intellectual leaders 
of society  acknowledge and 
respect the intrinsic worth of 
persons, and called upon all 
organizations within the Univer
sity to be open to all Carnegie 
Mellon students.
Cyerts statement contained an 
appendix that announced the 
formation of a Human Relations 
Commission to be chaired by Elli
ott and composed of students, 
staff, faculty and administration. 
The Commission, Cyert ex
plained, will develop a policy and 
procedure for handling com
plaints about violations of rights 
of groups and individuals. He said 
that the committee will comple
ment and facilitate existing poli
cies and procedures.
Cyert asked that all complaints 
of racial or sexual harassment be 
taken to this committee, and 
expressed his hope that the for
mation of this commission should
FnoDCpUoik pC,CtUCU pCsupi un arItn pC,tiounU
be a major step toward the accom
plishment of our objective of a 
campus with mutual respect.
Regarding the complaints of 
harassment that have already 
been made, Cyert vowed that we 
will deal with them and we will 
not tolerate such irresponsible 
behavior on our campus.
The second document in the 
package was a summary of ac
tions that the University has 
planned and has taken in response 
to campus sensitivity concerns 
expressed over the last two se
mesters. It was divided into three 
sections: university-wide issues, 
academic issues, and enrollment 
group issues.
The section of the report on 
university-wide issues listed vari
ous human relations training 
programs in which members of 
the campus community have been 
or will be participating.
These included a cultural sen
sitivity program hosted by the 
School of Urban and Public Af
fairs; freshman orientation for the 
class of 1993, which will have 
human relations as a primary 
focus; training of the residence 
life staff and education of resi
dents concerning self-awareness 
and appreciation of diversity; 
orientation of new faculty through 
programs dealing with equal 
treatment of individuals, the 
subtleties of teaching a multi
cultural population, and the 
importance of minority groups in 
our history; summer workshops 
for administrators focusing on 
ways in which key members of 
our community could actively 
engage this issue and enhance 
the awareness and sensitivity to 
cultural diversity; and the train
ing of the entire security force in 
ethnic intimidation awareness 
and prevention, cultural aware
ness, and the Pennsylvania 
Human Relations Act.
This section of the report noted 
that in February Cyert advanced
plans to reconstitute an Affirma
tive Action Visiting Committee 
to be made up of concerned indi
viduals who had experience in 
dealing with such issues. Finally, 
library efforts to purchase new 
books and periodicals and to de
velop new library resource guides 
dealing with Afro-American re
sources were detailed.
The section on academic issues 
summarized the efforts of the 
University to recruit minority 
faculty members. Efforts include 
the R. M. Cyert Incentive Offer, 
which offers departments that 
hire black faculty members sup
plemental funding; Cyerts re
quest to the deans to appoint 
special task forces to assist in the 
implementation of minority fac
ulty recruitment programs within 
each college; and the Universitys 
participation in a minority nameexchange program among pres
tigious universities.
This section also discussed the 
content of current courses and 
the development of new courses, 
including the additions of lectures 
on black concerns to courses in 
the departments of Social and 
Decision Sciences and History; the 
addition of a course on immigra
tion history; considerations by the 
Associate Provost for Academic 
Projects of a three-unit course in 
human relations; and the possible 
addition of an ethnic studies minor 
by the College of Humanities and 
Social Sciences.
The section on enrollment group 
issues dealt with minority con
cerns in Student Affairs, Admis
sions, C-MAP, and other areas. 
Regarding Student Affairs, the 
report contains a statement 
drafted for the Student Handbook 
concerning ethnic harassment; 
and, regarding the lack of any 
minority student employees, con
tains an assurance that the Dean 
of Student Affairs will continue 
to insure that any student em
ployment vacancies [in the Office

posted and that minority students 
are given every consideration.
The report detailed the efforts 
of the Admissions Office to con
tinue its campaign to aggressively 
recruit minority undergraduate 
students and a new brochure to 
emphasize the recruitment of 
minority graduate students in 
addition to the name exchange. 
The report also announced that 
a job description and reporting 
structure for a Minority Student 
Advisor type of position is being 
considered, and expressed hope 
that the position would be filled 
by this fall.
The report from Campus Secu
rity stressed the departments 
efforts to protect the rights and 
privileges of all members of the 
community, and [to] strongly 
condemn any actions that would 
deny those rights and privileges. 
The opening paragraph made 
clear that Campus Security con
demns racism as immoral... [and] 
illegal.
The report conceded that prob
lems exist and outlined the de
partments policies and programs 
that addressed minority issues. 
It re-emphasized the training of 
the members of the department 
on racial sensitivity and avoiding 
ethnic intimidation, and the train
ing of dispatchers to better gather 
information when suspicious 
persons are reported. Since 
Campus Security must respond 
to all reports of suspicious per
sons, this training also shows 
officers how to better handle the 
response to such calls.
Regarding the issues of gymna
sium security that were brought 
up, the report explained the diffi
culties in securing the building 
and announced that all persons 
entering the gymnasium would 
be required to show CMU identi
fication cards as of April 10. It 
also proposed assigning student 
monitors to the gymnasium enqrItn pC,tiounU B

Last Tuesday night I heard 
about a human relations con
ference that was scheduled to 
be held the next afternoon in 
the Wherret Room. I ended up 
going to it.
Wednesday night I looked at 
myself and saw a whole lot of 
positive change.
Im not sure why I decided to 
go. I had never been forced to 
recognize a personal lack of any 
human relations skills, what
ever they were. Id seen the 
headlines in The Tartan, last 
semester and more recently, 
about Spirits complaints to the 
administration about insensi
tivity, a term I couldnt iden
tify with. Surely, I wasnt in
sensitive.
But very recently these com
plaints had started to get 
through to the guy they were 
aimed at: me.
I had always fancied myself 
as some sort of enlightened in
dividual, ready to accept any
body on his or her merits. That 
was because I had grown up in 
an area of this country where I 
had the luxury of being able to
judge everybody with the same 
set of values and norms that I 
applied to myself.
It was nice and easy.
In my high school, there were 
about eleven hundred students:
About a dozen were black.
Four (including two ex
change students) were Asian.
Two were Jewish. (In both 
cases, it was kept secret.)
None were Hispanic, in 
name, appearance, or otherwise.
None were homosexual. 
(None dared admit it, at least, 
in my area.)
One each of my grandparents 
came from Sweden, Germany/ 
France, Germany, and Britain, 
each within one or two genera
tions. I was brought up to think 
that that was diverse.
The truth was that I was an 
enlightened individual from a 
predominantly (and damn near 
exclusively) white, middle-class, 
protestant neighborhood.
So I arrived at CMU last fall, 
and wondered where all the gays 
came from, and stayed away 
from the blacks, and puzzled 
continued on page 6
trance.
The report concluded by stat
ing that success will be meas
ured by our ability to use these 
tools, by our sincerity in address
ing these issues, and by our vig
ilance in combatting these prob
lems, and called upon the entire 
campus community for support 
in dealing with these problems.
Regarding the specific com
plaints of harassment recently 
brought up, Police Chief James 
LaPaglia agreed that there may 
have been some insensitivity, but 
there was no justification for 
taking any disciplinary action 
within the department. LaPaglia 
also stressed the efforts of his
department to find the underly-* 
ing causes of racial insensitivityj
Regarding the gymnasium situ-; 
ation, LaPaglia said that the real 
concern is with non-universit 
members attempting to use th 
facility, and said that he hopes to 
have all doors except the froni 
alarmed within two weeks.
LaPaglia emphasized the de
partments commitment to sensi; 
tivity training, citing a program 
that will be given by experts front 
the U. S. Department of Justice 
specifically for CMU Campus 
Security.

over the funny candle-holders 
they put up all over the place at 
Christmas time.
; I was beginning to get the idea 
^that my background had left me 
.unprepared to deal with people 
!from other places, with other 
"cultures and values.
- All the time I was growing up, I 
was taught that I shouldnt be 
^prejudiced, that I shouldnt judge 
olks by their color, or their reli
gion, or anything. :
But it was sort of a do as I say 
and not as I do lesson. I got mixed 
signals from my parents, my 
teachers, almost everybody in my 
jarea  everybody paid lip service 
Jo the rhetoric but used bad words 
.like nigger and jap and spick 
and chink and wop anyway. I 
had resolved that I would be dif
ferent.
Was I different? Sure, I was no 
blatant racist. I would insist that 
i loved a Jewish Black as much as 
.a Catholic from Bangkok as much 
as a handicapped lesbian.
! But when it came down to it, I 
really did treat them differently. 
5 realized that it was really hard 
for me to deal with these people, if 
for no other reason than that I 
;had never had to deal with them 
before.
; Then I saw the article about 
classroom racism in a recent is
sue of Campus Voice, that maga
zine they post in Grey Matter 
and the dorms. It talked about 
subtle racism. Subtle racism! That 
was a thought that had never 
occurred to me.
I Could it have been, was it really 
possible, that I could have been 
subtly, even unconciously, pro
jecting my prejudices to others? 
Could I have been that insensi
tive?
There was that word again! 
Suddenly I was forced to face my 
closet racism. Over break, I let 
this conflict quietly rattle around 
my head. Then I heard about the 
human relations conference.
 I realized that I had to go.
 I rushed back to my room after 
my last class Wednesday and 
changed into some nice clothes. I 
guess I was pretty nervous when 
I walked into the Wherret Room 
&t 4:30. I signed in and put on a 
name tag.
 People were beginning to form 
groups. I was directed to find a 
table where I didnt know any
body and sit there. The groups 
were arranged to represent maxi
mum diversity. We were forced to 
get to know each other.
For me, this meant getting to 
know a lot of people that I not only 
wouldnt have met otherwise, but 
from backgrounds and groups 
with which Ive never had any 
contact before.
; There was a black woman 
framed Mary from the Housing 
Office. And a Jewish girl from 
New York City. And two other 
lacks, who both grew up in what 
I would have called a ghetto. 
And a homosexual man named 
John. He was sitting right across 
from me. I sat there, thinking, Oh 
my God, Im meeting a homosex
ual. This guy is homosexual. I 
shook his hand! Am 1 going to get
Tartn
 The next thing I said to myself 
was, Youve really got a lot to learn, 
Jim.
; All of these people were differ
ent from me in a lot of ways, but 
Id rarely (if ever) had an occasion 
tio interact with anyone like them 
before.
; I had harbored a suspicion all 
along that they were normal 
l)uman beings, just like me. I was 
right.
! The people that had organized 
the meeting had prepared an 
agenda of discussion topics for 
each of the groups to work 
through. We talked about what 
each of us could do individually to 
help human relations on this 
qampus.
! By that time I had already be
come very clear in my own com
mitment to do my own part, to
make the effort, to start with me, 
to treat people more sensitively.
Eventually, all of the groups 
came to the same conclusion: that 
Carnegie Mellon needs a required 
Human Relations course.
We talked about how our back
grounds had produced each of our 
attitudes about others. It felt like 
they were reading my mind. I 
knew these others would have 
different backgrounds than me, 
but I wasnt prepared for how 
different they were. I was also 
taken by surprise at how inter
ested I was in these peoples lives, 
and how worthwhile I felt their 
stories were. I even was surprised 
at my reaction. And I felt myself 
wanting to know more, and won
dering why I hadnt made the 
effort earlier.
Thats when I hit the bottom 
line: effort is what is important. 
It takes effort  personal effort
 for people to get to understand 
people.
Thats the reason I think it is so 
important for the University to 
implement a required Human 
Relations course. Its vital. Its 
crucial. Everybody deserves, and 
everybody needs, the experience 
that I was priveleged to take part 
in last Wednesday.
In order to really get along in
this world, you and I are going to 
have to get along with other 
people. And to get along with other 
people, you and I are going to 
have to accept and tolerate differ
ences sensitively. This doesntjust 
mean when interacting with cer
tain minorities  Im talking 
about basic human dignity and 
respect, no matter who youre 
dealing with.
All of this takes effort and prac
tice. And a course in Human Re
lations is a natural and necessary 
place for that effort and practice.
I have become involved with a 
group called ONE. ONE is a coa
lition group that has representa
tives from each of many of the 
minority groups on this campus. 
Right now, representatives from 
Spirit, GALA, Asian Student 
Association, Women for Women, 
Amnesty, and other groups make 
up ONE; we are trying to make 
other groups aware of our exis
tence, too.
But ONE is more than just a 
group of minorities. ONE is your 
group, no matter who you are. 
Even if (like me) you dont con
veniently fit into any of ONEs 
constituent groups, youre still 
invited to be involved. Everybody 
stands to gain from good human 
relations here at CMU.

The following is the complete 
text ofPresident Cyerts statement, 
dated March 20, Striving for 
Mutual Respect in the Pluralistic 
Society at Carnegie Mellon. Ed.
One of my objectives as presi
dent has been to develop a cam
pus with a diverse population, 
gaining from the richness of this 
diversity, and tolerating no dis
crimination on the basis of racial, 
ethnic, or sexual characteristics. 
The United States will not reach 
the full potential we need until 
we create a society that is fully 
mutually supporting. Our cam
pus should strive to be a model for 
the larger society.
Mutual respect means that 
people accept one another as 
individuals and appreciate their 
racial, ethnic, and sexual attrib
utes. It means eliminating preju
dices based on race, gender, eth
nic background, or similar char
acteristics. Carnegie Mellon has 
to be a leader in demonstrating 
that intelligent people recognize 
the folly of prejudice. We must 
show that educated people  the 
intellectual leaders of society  
acknowledge and respect the in
trinsic worth of persons.
To develop this mutual respect, 
we must be sensitive to the fact 
that certain symbols, words, and 
actions can offend one another. 
For mutual respect to flourish 
here, we have to eliminate insti
tutions in which participation is 
based on racial characteristics. 
Furthermore, all institutions, 
such as fraternities, sororities, 
honoraries, clubs, and other or
ganizations, must be open to all 
Carnegie Mellon students. The 
ability to live, work, and relax 
together is vital for our campus 
community as we continue to build 
a university that can be a model 
for others. The ability to use the 
resources of our society without 
regard to color, gender, religion, 
sexual orientation, or any other 
characteristic that is irrelevant 
to intellectual and social growth 
is essential for our campus, as 
well as our country. Americans 
are in a struggle with many other 
countries for intellectual and 
economic success, and we must 
use the best brains our society 
can produce to strengthen our po
sition.
We must resolve to eliminate 
the insensitivities that may un
necessarily wound other members
of our community, and we must 
extend ourselves so that all per
sons recognize their fundamental 
worth as human beings. We must 
make a commitment to ourselves 
that will enhance our own lives 
through a greater understanding 
and appreciation of the diverse

This nation was founded on a 
desire for religious freedom, an^ 
it has been nurtured and strength 
ened by a willingness to accept 
people from all parts of the world 
and with diverse backgrounds a 
its citizens. This diversity, which 
is evident on our own campus, 
has been a major strength of 
America throughout our history.

we call the United States will be

Cohesiveness achieved by an

Just because your Mom is far

It costs less than you think to

continued from page 1
meeting Ruben asked to help 
with letter. I said to myself, I 
want to have a part in this too, 
recalled Ruben.
It was fun, admitted 
Barnhart, it was good to work 
with him [Ruben]. We could pro
vide a unified journalistic front.
The original draft was com
pleted before Spring Break and 
given to Robitshek, who used it 
to create a final letter.
The final version, dated April
4, cites three major concerns: a 
perceived lack of effort to raise 
money for bricks and mortar, 
the lack of a start date for the 
Centers construction, and the 
seeming absence of communi
cation between the administra
tion and students over the 
Centers status.
No major results seem to have 
come out of the meeting with 
Cyert. However, Robitshek, 
Barnhart, and Ruben all indi
cated that this had been the 
expected result.
I think it [the Center] was 
reasonably discussed. I was not
expecting a great deal out of it, 
so Im not that upset that the 
world did not change, said 
Robitshek. He added, however, 
Cyert did not give us a date, 
and thats something to push 
hard for.
Ruben agreed, saying, Cyert 
wasnt going to make us any 
promises. He was more recep
tive than he was at the State of 
the University Speech.
The Tartan was unable to 
contact President Cyert for com
ment.
At that speech, a combative 
Cyert fended off criticism that 
the Center project had been in
definitely postponed.
Instead, he linked the project 
to the current East Campus con
struction, but admitted that 
construction would not begin at 
least until CMUs $200 million 
Capital Campaign ends in 1991.
Cyerts talk marked a start of 
open discussion about the Uni
versity Center. 1 think its fi
nally starting to sink in how 
important this issue is, said 
Barnhart.
continued from page 6
individual behaves responsibly 
and, where such behavior furthers 
the cause of humanity rather than 
returns it to a less enlightened 
[period.
All of us are committed to 
making democracy work; there
fore, we must dedicate ourselves 
to behavior toward others that is 
consistent with our objective of 
mutual respect. We must spread 
abroad our understanding of the 
significance of a campus and soci
ety where mutual respect is fore
most. We have no alternative if 
we are to insure the viability of 
Carnegie Mellon and America. To 
contribute by our own behavior to 
the understanding and realizing 
of such a campus and a nation is 
one of the greatest contributions 
[we can make.
Appendix 
is a positive move toward our 
i, I am forming a Human Rela
tions Commission for our rela
tionships on the campus. William 
'f. Elliott will chair this commis
sion, composed of students, staff, 
facility, and members of the ad
ministration. It will set standards 
For the kinds of interpersonal. 
Relations we want to form on the 
campus. It will be a forward-look
ing group that will act as an oversight committee and will recom
mend programs and actions aimed 
at enhancing mutual respect on 
the campus.
Its emphasis will be on the 
development of a policy and the 
establishment of a procedure for 
receiving and investigating com
plaints from students, staff, 
administration, and faculty about 
violations of individual and col
lective rights. I want to empha
size that this commission will 
complement and facilitate exist
ing policies and procedures, such 
as those of the Staff Council, 
Faculty Senate, and staff and 
student ombudsmen. If necessary, 
it will suggest revised policies and 
procedures in these areas to me to 
make these mechanisms work 
more efficiently for the good of all 
people involved.
Any events or actions that seem 
to involve racial or sexual harass
ment should be filed with this 
commission, which will investi
gate these complaints and make 
recommendations to me regard
ing how to solve the problems 
surrounding them. Further, it will 
act as an advisory committee to 
me in these matters. We want 
everyone in the Carnegie Mellon 
community to recognize that this 
campus belongs to all its members. We want to eliminate any 
insensitivity on our campus.
The formation of this commis
sion should be a major step to
ward the accomplishment of a 
campus with mutual respect. In 
addition, there are a number of 
programs underway or in the 
planning stage that will contrib
ute to a better understanding of 
and support for each other.
We have had several com
plaints of harassments of various 
kinds. We will deal with them 
and we will not tolerate such irre
sponsible behavior on our cam
pus.
Therefore, the success of this 
commission and the attainment 
of our goal of mutual respect are 
going to require hard work, coop
eration, and dedication of every
one.

Freerolls are over, the booths 
are being set up, and almost no 
one is getting any sleep. Spring 
Carnival is almost upon us.
Many times we thought we 
wouldnt make it to this weekend. 
Between papers and crits, pro
grams and case studies, life at 
Carnegie Mellon can leave you 
gasping for breath.
But this is the one weekend when 
we can all relax and have fun, 
things that are often missing from 
our daily routines. Make sure that 
you find a way to enjoy yourself.
Some of you will want nothing 
more than to sleep late, drink, 
and lounge around. Thats fine, 
but remember all thats going to 
be going on around you.
Over500 people have beenbuilding, driving, and pushing buggies 
this year. All of their hard work 
will be on display Thursday in the 
Gym at the Design competition, 
and Friday and Saturday during 
the Sweepstakes races.
The booths on the midway will
be the result of even more lrd 
work. There will be over 30 bohs 
dealing with this years thee> 
Toyland, in front of Skibo. Eft 
with its own game and prizes^
There will also be a lot of entx 
tainment, from movies in Dohert 
to Scotch and Sodas new play, t 
all of the events in the Tent, ti 
special acts in Scotland Yard.
Why are we repeating all of the' 
things were telling you in Uni
versity Living? Because theyre 
important. Weve all earned this 
break; we deserve this Carnival.
There are no classes Thursday 
night or Friday, except in GSIA 
and SUPA. Two unfortunate ex
ceptions on a campus that should 
be devoted, this weekend, to rest 
and relaxation.
So, remember that all of the hard 
work that got us here should go 
somewhere else, maybe Cornell, 
for these four days.
We at The Tartan are going to 
have a lot of fun this weekend. We 
hope you do, too.

The ball, as they say, is in Presi
dent Cyerts court.
Last Tuesday, twelve student 
leaders, led by Student Govern
ment President Andrew Ro
bitshek, met with Cyert and gave 
him a letter signed by 20 student 
leaders, a petition signed by al
most 2,000 students, and five reso
lutions all advocating the Univer
sity Center.
The students offered to help raise 
fluids for the Center and asked to

Today at 3:30 in the Adamson 
Wing, the Student Presidential 
Search Committee will hold an 
open forum to present a draft of 
its white paper, a summary of 
problems the next president will 
face. The forum is sponsored by 
the faculty search committee, 
which will also present a paper.
The student paper, as a member 
of the committee laments, was 
written by the 15-member com
mittee with little input from the 
rest of the student body. Because 
this committee was designed and 
established to represent all CMU 
students, we at The Tartan find 
this diminished interest in this 
crucial report unacceptable.

be kept informed of the fundrais
ings status. For his part, the Presi
dent agreed to meet with the stu
dents again in two weeks and 
promised to consider ways they 
could help in fundraising.
For the first time since the 
Center became an issue, students 
and administrators are talking, 
face to face. We hope that this 
kind of communication continues.
If so, Cyert may be able to serve 
up an ace.
and applaud the work it has done, 
we urge youthe students whom 
this committee represents  to 
read the paper and go to the forum 
today to give your views. A copy of 
the report will be availableinHunt 
Library.
When the committee was formed 
earlier this semester, there were 
enough students interested in it 
to call an emergency meeting of 
Student Senate to have the com
mittee dissolved and reformed. 
Where has that support gone?
Rather than complaining about 
the lack of student input in CMUs 
decision-makingprocess, go to the 
meeting. This is the most impor
tant decision Carnegie Mellon will 
make for years to come.
Edid
I atVded the March 16 meeting between^irit, Admissions, and Campus 
Police.yiso attended the press confer
ence attach I thought I spotted a Tar
tan reptW I looked forward to the next 
issue of\e Tartan to see how well the 
writers cd manipulate facts, misquote 
testamen\ and otherwise change an 
entire ne\^ story to fit their own pur
poses (whiat the same time managing 
to relay a fcj-eal facts so that their story 
will have s<ie similarity to the truth). 
But as we \ know, thats what most 
forms of thevess are famous for.
So why amwriting this letter? I was 
troubled by aw quotes of Police Chief 
LaPaglia. Im^t sure if I should sympa
thize with LaR-lia for being misquoted, 
or if I should asgpirit to reschedule the 
meeting and kq\y ask Chief LaPaglia 
to get some sleebeforehand so that he 
may be more aleimd, perhaps, remem
ber more of whate were saying during 
the meeting. \
If he truly rem^bers what we were 
saying, then he uld not have been 
quoted as saying, U should be part of 
the solution and no^he problem. Obvi
ously theres concern the part of our 
black students thatVe Campus Police 
are not a part of the uution but we are 
part of the problem. I\hey do have that 
perception then we dLve a problem.
When members oftas department
fCiiCpU iu iaC Phoiup
continue to question, scrutinize, and 
pester a black student after proper ID 
has already been presented and no crime 
has been committed, the department is 
part of a problem (a rather large part, I 
might add).
I, along with other black students, look 
forward to the day when Campus Police 
can be part of the solution and not just 
part of the problem. Its not that hard. 
All they have to do is stop harrassing 
black students so that those black stu
dents will no longer have the perception 
that they are being harrassed.
In an indirect quote concerning the 
stereo equipment incident, LaPaglia is 
stated as saying that the students felt as 
if they were being harrassed and that 
perhaps the officers should have better 
explained what they were doing. It is 
true, the students had a feeling. If the 
officers had bothered to explain that they 
were harrassing the students and search
ing for every possible excuse to have 
them arrested, then the students would 
have had solid knowledge.
But with experience comes knowledge. 
Black males have experienced similar 
situations on this campus so many times 
that they now have solid knowledge of 
the fact that they are being harrassed. 
We all know whats going on, including

Editor:
It is about time that sofc0ne finally 
does something about thisiiot Eirene. 
He is not a student and rUly has no 
business in campus affairs. A he does is 
complain about the distribtjon of re
search money for a defensehroject, a 
project specifically aimed atVotecting 
our country. I dont understand m when 
he says, and I quote, There ytons of 
money to devise exotic ways till each 
other, when what is being dona trying 
to devise means of protection Am the 
most destructive weapons ever. iL man 
must either be losing a grip on reVty or 
be utterly ignorant of the issuesVlso, 
the man seems devoid of knowleoe of 
the opinions of a large number o&tudents on campus who are in favor o\he 
Software Engineering Institute andhe
influx of defense-related research money 
to our campus.
I personally find that just about every
one I know thinks that Mr. Eirene is just 
an extremely annoying individual who 
has no place complaining about campus 
affairs, not to mention doing it in the 
wrong forum. If Mr. Eirene really wishes 
to accomplish something about the SEI 
issue he should complain at the source of 
the funds, not where they are being spent. 
If he really wants results, and not just to 
make an ass of himself, he should either 
go to Washington or write his congress
man, not only because this should be 
more effective, but also because we are 
getting tired of hearing his irritating 
rhetoric. The man must be a truly dis
turbed person if he understands the 
continued on page 11
Chief LaPaglia. I thought he understood 
that during the meeting. I guess I mis
read his behavior. If we didnt come to 
that basic understanding during 1 
meeting, what else are we pretending to 
have an understanding about?
Luckily, I have not been harrassed 
personally but I sympathize with all o 
you who have been. Thinking back, I 
recall a security information sesion 
during my C-MAP summer. I had the 
feeling that the officer who was speaiing 
was more concerned with telling us 
(especially the males who sat mostly o 
the one side of the room) to .. .not nake 
the mistake of getting smart with cam
pus police, instead of normal security 
issues such as keeping your door locked 
and being careful at night. Back than, I 
had a feeling. Now I have knowledge.

employment status
Editor:
In recent weeks there have ben 
numerous inquiries and some misunlerstandings regarding my employnent 
status at CMU. I am writing to claify 
my situation.
I was hired in the Fall of 1983 as an 
assistant professor of philosophy. lur
ing my first few years here, I cam< to 
realize that I was unable to do the re
search expected for tenure and be a 
committed to teaching as I wanted tobe. 
Since I was primarily interested in team
ing, I decided to give up my tenure-trick 
position and, since 1986, I have been 
employed at CMU on a year-to-year baas. 
For the past two years my teaching hs 
been funded on soft (i.e. grant) morey 
through the University Studies progran. 
This year I was informed that after tKs 
academic year there would be no furthr 
funding available to support my teaciing.
Several of my students heard thatl 
was not being rehired and organized i 
letter-writing campaign to see if thee 
was some way that I could continue ti 
teach at CMU. In response to their e?

Carnegie Mellon University, as we I 
know, is the type of school where sti 
dents are so pressed that any additiona 
aggravation, in any way and on anjj
thermore, the effort you take to commu
nicate with the personnel at the Finan
cial Aid office is parallel to banging your 
head against a wall. Just by speaking to 
the secretaries in the office you get the

end. It is even worse when this aggrava-kttitudes) that they do not care about or

Hall. The office of Financial Aid on the Ihis fact is very scary, considering you 
second floor of Warner Hall continually |ive to trust someone for four years to 
seems to have the highest frequency of lbk over your best financial interest at 
rude and unfriendly personnel. Being a tis institution of higher learning. Morefifth year student, I feel that I have seen o\jr, if our financial aid office neglects
enough of this department to make me 
doubt their efficiency as well as their 
concern for us, the students (without 
whom they would not have a university).
They often send double copies of unim
portant forms, as well as forget to send 
out extremely urgent paper work on time. 
Then it is your problem to correct their 
mistakes, which often takes a few visits 
to the office over several weeks. Fureeds who will care for them? After 
yot|iave spent at least a half hour waitsee an advisor or convincing the 
sectaries to let you see an advisor, your 
finafcial worries are fueled once again. I 
fullybelieve that these advisors are 
traind in confusing expectations of financil need. My advisor always runs 
throui my file looking for what is incomplde and what I am ineligible for
before the word help is uttered. Need 
less to say, this is quite dishearteningHowever, there is one redeeming qual 
ity of the Financial Aid officeMr. Waltei 
Cathie. This man seems to be the only 
person, on that half of the 2nd floor of 
Warner, who really looks over your files 
considers your situation, respects your 
opinion, and more importantly, 
friendly enough to ask How are you 
doing today? or How are classes treat
ing you? He is the type of person that 
can give you hope that someone cares 
up there. However, Mr. Cathie is step
ping down. I am thankful that I am 
graduating when I am, because when 
Mr. Cathie is gone it seems like trusting 
your money to the CMU Financial Aid 
Office is as bleak as throwing your money
in the fire.

)rout attempts to clarify the BA/BS issue
For the past semester and a 
,alf, 60 Coarse has always ad[ressed itself to perceived prob
ers in academics while at the 
ame time attempting to keep 
,bove the topic of the week style 
lebate that often goes on at Cariegie Mellon. However, this week 
feel it is necessary to break my 
m written rule and discuss a topic 
hat has been gathering headjnes in campus papers for weeks.
seems to me that there has 
,een so much meat-headedness, 
and mis-information, and 
mple failure to comprehend 
/hat is being said about the enBS/BA issue that it is time to 
ear the air and get the facts 
own on paper.
To get the facts, we go immeditely to that infallible repository 
University information, the 
ollege catalog. There, on page 
69, we find some very simple 
lformation about the BS and BA 
rograms. There it is in black and 
fhite: ...BS degrees are offered 
areas requiring special techniand scientific competencies 
iver and above that required in 
he Science and Technology porof the H&SS core curricuum. Simple, aint it? I can unerstand whats meant there. If 
he people in the field feel that
8& dutpUC
yoJatC, gpuri
mathematical and statistical tools 
are necessary, then you have to 
take a BS. Of course theres a sub
jective judgement involved, but 
not a real big one.
So why all the brouhaha? Well 
first, because there are some 
people at
this Univ e r s i t y 
who really 
enjoy 
hearing 
them
selves 
talk. And, 
if there 
are not WiMWW^IIWWllWWIW 
any good issues lying around, 
these people will create them. 
Therefore wehaveabigfuss, with 
students needlessly worrying if 
their degrees are going to be 
canceled or their programs phased 
out.
Well, unless theres a major 
change in any of the fields in
volved, dont worryI dont fore
see Creative Writing majors being 
required to take advanced Stats 
(though they should, because then
theyd have the opportunity to be 
taught by Professor Greenhouse, 
one of CMITs finest teachers).
And anyway, if there were only 
BSs offered, would that be such a 
tragedy? To address the question 
of one logically inconsistent letter 
to The Tartan [Student ques
tions Dean Fienbergs intentions 
3/14], there is a simple way to de
termine if a BS is better than the 
concurrent BA by using simple 
economic 
theory. If 
a BA is 
simply a 
subset of 
the BS, 
then a 
student 
getting 
the BS is 
unambiTo get the facts, we go 
immediately to that infal
lible repository of Univer
sity information, the col
lege catalogue. 
guously better off because the BS 
contains everything in the BA and 
then some. A student would not 
only learn the same amount (in 
theory) from all the overlapping 
classes, but he or shed get three 
or four more classes worth by 
taking the BS.
One other incorrect argument 
submitted was the idea that natu
ral sciences and mathematics are 
anathema to liberal arts. This is 
one of the most moronic argu
ments Ive ever heard. Since when 
is this true? If a liberal arts type 
person cant understand science 
and math, wheres the liberality 
in the education? Well-rounded
ness doesnt mean dropping one 
thing for the other, it means learn
ing and understanding both.
Just one last point  is this 
whole thing actually an issue? 
Are there any people who really 
wanted to tackle the mathemati
cally oriented major of Social 
Science History without the tools 
to do so? Is there anyone who this 
decision actually hurt? I dont 
think so. There havent been any 
interviews with any wronged 
Social Science History BA major 
wanna-bes.
Why didnt someone go right to 
the catalog and get the facts be
fore starting the debate? Well, 
because this is just another 
manufactured issue that arose so 
some people could hear them
selves talk. And that takes time, 
publicity, energy, and focus away 
from issues that the average stu
dent cares about. And thats a 
shameful waste.

Until South Africas withdrawal 
omNamibiafell apartlastweek,
was beginning to appear that 
;ace was starting to prevail 
mong nations.
The recent record of resolved 
inflicts is impressive. Iran and 
aq have reached a stable ceasere. The Soviets have completely 
illed out of Afghanistan. The 
ontras no longer pose a threat to 
ace in Central America. Vietam has promised to end its decde-long occupation of Cambodia. 
War between nations is rapidly 
>ing out of style. For example, 
fth minor exceptions, Europe 
managed to remain at peace 
r over forty years. Nuclear 
eapons have cemented Western 
dopes borders and allowed for 
>e establishment of the Euro!an community.
Meanwhile, Gorbachev is dediped to demilitarizing his couny- By admitting that current 
c>alism is inadequate, the Rusans have backed away from their 
U'd world commitments. More 
an anything else, this has 
aiked the end to world conflict. 
On the other hand, we are not 
the brink of world peace. Interal conflicts are on the rise. Raethnic, and cultural differlces are replacing petty grievices among nations as the threat 
Peace.
Religious intolerance continues 
tear nations apart. Northern 
elands violence persists with
out any end in sight. Racial injus
tice, of course, -leaves South Af
rica on the edge of disaster.
Ethnic differences have 
prompted protest in the largest 
nations  the Soviet Union, 
China, and India. As provinces in 
the east of the Soviet Union, 
Chinas Tibet, and Indias Sikh 
Moslems continue to appeal for 
greater autonomy, peace will be 
threatened. If the leaders of those 
mammoth countries remain prag
matic, violence will be adverted.
Nowhere is the shift from war 
to protest more clearly demon
strated than in the Middle East. 
The Arab-Israeli wars ended in 
stalemate in the 1970s. As Israel 
continues to occupy the WestBank 
and the Gaza Strip, the situation 
has shifted to an internal prob
lem. Now that the Arab world 
tacitly acknowledges the exis
tence of a J ewish state, the Pales
tinian uprising in those occupied 
territories is Israels primary 
security problem.
Perhaps it is too optimistic to 
believe we have seen the last wars 
between nations. But for the 
moment the world breathes eas
ier as countries turn inward.
Which is why I question the 
need for us to spend $300 billion a 
year for military hardware and 
personnel. Who are our enemies 
who are so bad that we have to 
devote so much of our resources to 
protect us?

Life is worth living again. Its

Since I was eight years old, I 
have spent most of my time be

imagine that

like other peoples overgrown 
yards on both sides of the ball 
field to teach you how to hit the 
ball back up the middle (or how to 
climb every fence on the block 
when you dont).
However, on the down side, I 
did not develop into much of a

Despite having suffered 
through a combined 24 seasons of 
Cubs and White Sox baseball with 
only two division championships, 
there is still nowhere I would 
rather be than at the ballpark. 
(Well, almost nowhere else, but 
that part of my life is about like 
the Cubs pennant chances; occa

With that in mind, I would like 
to present my first annual major 
league baseball predictions. These 
are not predictions about which 
teams will finish where in the 
standings. Any idiot can make 
those sorts of predictions (and 
based on the record of accuracy 
for such predictions, I would say 
that most do). These are individ

The University Center
caC jpCUohCnixU UitiCICni
  This is the statement on the 
University Center President Rich
ard Cyert made in his State of the 
. University address on March 10. 
.. The Tartan was asked to print it 
in order to make the Presidents 
position clear. Ed.
In recent weeks there have been 
an increasing number of ques
tions regarding the University 
, Center. I wish to make public my 
..position on this issue and reiter
ate a statement I made to the 
Trustees Development and Plan
ning Committee in November.
The University Center Com
plex, which includes the East 
Campus buildings, stadium, 
fields, and the University Center 
building, is important in the over, all strategy for improving and up. grading campus facilities and our 
environment. As I stated to the 
Trustees, this complex, including 
the University Center building, 
must be completed. Fundraising 
efforts for the University Center 
'"Complex have raised approxi
mately $12 million to date and 
will continue through the remain
der of the capital campaign, into 
the summer of 1991. At that time 
the fundraising situation will be 
assessed by the administration 
and plans and strategies devel
oped for the project. In the mean
time, the East

clude the new dormitory/dining 
hall, a parking garage, athletic 
field, stadium, a future building 
site, and intramural fields, in con
junction with the . University 
Center building, will provide an 
enormous improvement in the
separate entities. The decision to 
move ahead with the East Cam
pus project was based on this con
cept and assumes the eventual 
construction of the University 
Center building in order to com
plete the overall scheme.

As the campus master plan 
evolved, it became clear that an 
important opportunity was pres

now termed the East Campus

exchange than is now available 
on the campus.
A major concentration of the 
East Campus project is the addi
tion of a dining hall which replace 
the Kiltie dining facility in Skibo. 
With the completion of the East 
Campus project, dining spaces 
vacated in Skibo will be used to

The anticipated investment for 
the University Center Complex 
(University Center building and 
East Campus project) is approxi
mately $70 million. Half the fund
ing ($35m) for this complex has 
been secured. The funding comes 
from various sources, including 
the capital fundraising campaign 
($12m) and fees generated from 
the housing and parking system 
($23m). The capital campaign

ing garage. The remaining funds 
($35m) to complete the comple( 
will continue to be one of the focal 
points of the capital campaign. To 
date, 25% of the fundraising taget for the University Centg 
Complex has been achieved.
Future Actions
For this objective to be achieved, 
the faculty, the staff, students, 
administration, and trustees 
must be united in purpose anddirection. Completion of the Uni 
versity Center Complex is a ma. 
jor undertaking that will sign 
cantly improve the quality of 
University. In 1991, at the enda 
the campaign, my successor, along 
with the Board of Trustees, wj 
determine the completion date ft 
the fundraising and set the date 
to begin construction of the University Center building.
Student Senates resolution
This is the Student Senate reso
lution which was presented to 
President Cyert last Tuesday, 
April 4. With it were almost 2000 
petitioned signatures collected 
Over the past month. Ed.
Whereas the Student Senate is 
one of the main outlets of student 
opinion at Carnegie Mellon
And whereas since the old Uni
versity Center, Skibo, was built 
in 1960 the Student Enrollment 
has increased over thirty percent 
(*yet the facilities remain, for the 
most part, unchanged.
And whereas the present esti
mate for the UC has been put at 
five years or more from now in
stead of the previous timetable 
that would have started ground 
breaking within the next year.
... And whereas the University 
XJenter would service many needs 
Yn a single structure.
These include:
Creation of a common place for 
all students and faculty to meet 
and gather.
At present Skibo does not meet 
this need. Skibo has Grey Mat
ter, which is not large enough or 
.conducive to serve as a student/ 
faculty gathering area.
In addition, the new dormitory 
and cafeteria will result in a split
ting of students. Currently there 
is a feeling that students in Morewood tend to stay in Morewood 
(the northern dorm). Once the 
new cafeteria is in operation, Hill 
dorm residents of the eastern 
campus will not need leave the 
Hill except for classes. This adds 
another division to an already 
fragmented student body.
Increased meeting rooms.
Skibo has two executive meet
ing rooms and three other all 
purpose rooms that can are used 
for meetings by the campus com
munity. At times all of these rooms 
do not meet the demand of the 
students, let alone the campus.
Increased assembly space.
Skibo contains two large assem
bly spaces, the Ballroom and 
Wherrett Room. When used in 
lecture-style, the most efficient 
use of space, the ballroom can 
only hold 500 persons; and the 
Wherrett Room, 180 persons, 
compared with the present en
rollment of approximately 6400 
these numbers are quite small 
indeed. At present it is necessary 
to contract outside lecture halls 
whenever a larger space is needed, 
adding to the cost of these events.
Increased number of accessible 
student offices.
At present Skibo contains of
fices for 15 student organiztions 
in 14 offices. Six other organiza
tions have closets instead of of
fices. Skibo does not come close to
meeting the student need for of
fice space. The Universty Center 
should provide enough offices for 
present and some future needs.
A central building for student 
services.
At present the art and book 
stores are in two separate build
ings on opposite ends of the cam
pus. Both stores have inadequate 
space for storage and display to 
provide a quality assortment to 
the campus community.
In addition, the Student Affairs 
Departments are located in three 
different buildings. The need for 
a central location for all of these 
departments is essential as the 
student body grows to help re
duce the high stress environment 
of this institution.
And whereas a new University 
Center has been proposed for the 
Students of Carnegie Mellon and 
according to the Task Force Re
port of the Quality of Student Life 
should commence at the earliest 
possible time.
We the Student Senate of Car
negie Mellon, as a student voice, 
demand that the University 
Center be placed at the top of the 
priority list of both the current 
administration and the one to 
follow. Both admin si trations 
should make every effort to un
dertake the project which was an
nounced.
Student leaders position
The following letter was written 
and signed by 20 student lead
ers led by Student Government 
President Andrew Robitshek. It 
was presented to Cyert on Tues
day, April 4. Ed.
Dear President Cyert:
We are writing to urge you to 
make the University Center the 
first priority in 
fundraising ef
forts. As 
stated in the
1987 Task 
Force on the 
Quality of Stu
dent Life, The 
University
Center is central to the devel
opment of university life. With 
the commencement of the 1986 
Capital Campaign, CMU com
mitted itself to improving the 
quality of the university; the 
primary embodiment of this 
ideal is a complete, functional 
university center. While the 
promise of a center is effective 
in raising funds, it does nothing 
to improve the quality of life. 
Only the completion of the cen
ter will achieve this.
' We feel your administration 
is not lending full support to
ward the current fundraising
"Rumors and con
fusion only arise 
when facts are 
not presented. 
for the center. While it has been 
stated that it is harder to raise 
money for bricks and mortar than 
for scholarships and endowed pro
fessorships, the small amount of 
money donated for the Center so 
far demonstrates a lack of credi
bility to your current efforts. We 
do not think that you are unable 
to raise the money, as we have 
full confidence 
in you. Rather 
we would hope 
you would give 
a full personal 
commitment in 
soliciting 
alumni, foundations, corpora
tions, benefactors, and trustees.
In addition, all unrestricted 
funds should be used for the 
Center.
It is vital that you set a specific 
date on which construction will 
start. This way, you, the Develop
ment Office, and Alumni Rela
tions can work towards a tangible 
goal. Further, the students we 
represent need assurances that 
the center will, in fact, be built in 
the future. If the money is not 
raised by a certain date, we are 
not worried that the center will 
not be built. Because, as you have 
stated before, the center can be
started if a certain amount of 
the money is raised. Without 
this date as a goal, students 
will continue to believe that the 
center will never be built, de
spite any verbal assurances 
from you to the contrary.
Acknowledging your com
ments concerning a unified ef
fort, we  the students  are 
willing to work for the center.If 
this includes writing letters, 
making calls, or contacting 
alumni, we will help in any way 
we can.
However, in order to be of any 
help, we must be aware of the 
facts. Rumors and confusion 
only arise when facts are ^ot 
presented. We ask that students 
participate in overseeing allas
pects of the campaign, from fun
draising to planning, as we see 
no current student involvement 
in the current center.
The bottom line is that fun
draising specifically for the Uni
versity Center is risky and re
quires a wholehearted commit
ment. We are asking you to 
make such a commitment. The 
university community is worth 
such a risk.
Sincerely,
Concerned Campus Leader

4. On April 18 or 19, between 9:30 am and 4:00 pm, go to the departments teaching the course(s) you wish to register for and 
obtain registration approval. Courses are not processed without department approval.
5. After obtaining all approvals, sign the R3D and return it to your department. Even if you don't obtain all department
approvals, submit the R3D anyway; you can try to add an unapproved course in August.
If you need further information or assistance, contact your department or the Registrar's Office, 268-2004.

Editor:
Along with approximately 300 
others, I am currently enrolled in 
Decision Making, a required 
course for H&SS students offered 
through the Department of Social 
and Decision Sciences. In the past 
three months this class has ranged 
from elusive and frustrating to 
banal and boring, often at the 
same time. I shouldnt complain, 
my grade at mid-semester was 
rather pleasing, but I feel that I 
must. I have talked with a small 
but fairly representative number 
of students who are also in the 
class, none of whom are satisfied, 
many of them dismayed.
What frustrates me the most 
about the class is that almost all 
of the material covered in the 
lectures is also covered in the Sta
tistics and Cognitive Processes 
classes, which are also required 
for H&SS students. Granted, I 
am taking these classes out of 
order and should have taken 
Decision Making in my freshman 
year, but my point is that the 
same material is covered twice. 
Couldnt the time spent in DeciLetters to the Editor_______
sion Making be better utilized by 
a class that doesnt deal with sta
tistics, cognitive processes, or de
cision processes? Repetition in a 
required course asks for trouble 
from uncooperative students.
I also feel the material that is 
covered in Decision Making is not 
plentiful enough to fill a nine unit 
course. The Tuesday lectures are 
sparsely filled with repetitious ex
amples and information.The top
ics dont seem logically connected. 
I truly cannot see an overall di
rection of the course. I feel like 
Im learning (for the second time) 
about representative thinking, 
availability, and framing, which 
are important concepts, but the 
weight of the course as a whole is 
very light. I feel the lectures could 
be processed into handouts and 
nothing would be lost in the trans
lation. To spend an hour and 
twenty minutes on the Gamblers 
Fallacy and the mutual exclusive
ness of coin flips is ridiculous.
The recitations are banal. There
is so little material to discuss that 
when these recitations dont en
tail a review of Tuesdays mate
rial, they dive deeply into bureau
cratic wastes of time. I find it an 
incredible infraction upon my time 
to spend an hour and twenty min
utes in recitation with only in
structions on how to conduct ex
periments, inaccurate data com
pilations, graded papers with no 
comments, lecture notes, and 
vague reviews of over-generalized 
material to show for it. Why cant 
this be done on Tuesday and spend 
Thursday discussing, in greater 
detail, the theories that we are 
presently learning?
The papers have been incredi
bly vague and general. They are 
structured in a way to force stu
dents to write them as a social 
and decision scientist would, but 
doesnt that stifle the students 
creativity? The most recent paper 
topic was so vague that my TA 
even admitted that the staff didnt 
know what was to be expected 
from them because it was the first 
time for this type of assignment. 
If the teaching staff doesnt know
what they want, how are the stu
dents supposed to know? Ill give 
this assignment a shot in the dark 
and hope that I come up in the 
upper 15% so I can get my A.
The grading system, as far as I 
can decipher its seemingly clan
destine nature, is entirely offbase. I got a 6.5 (on a 10 point 
scale) on my last paper. Now, it is 
safe to assume that 65% of the 
material included in my paper 
was correct and 35% was either 
missing or incorrect. I may be 
biased, but I didnt think my paper 
was that bad. Neither did the 
grader it seems. From this person 
I got many checks. Assuming 
that checks mean that I did 
something right, and all of their 
comments, except one, were posi
tive. If 35% of the material was 
lacking, how can I tell which 
material it was? How do they 
expect my decision making skills 
to improve?
I got points taken off my last 
paper because I didnt include the 
example that was given to us three 
times in three straight lectures. 
What is the point of putting this
example in my paper if it is such 
an obvious example to everyone 
that will be reading it? Is this 
discipline? Why should I get a 
lower grade because I dont spit 
back rote examples on my paper?
I will be the first to agree that we 
learn from our mistakes, but our 
grades should not be the price to 
pay for this knowledge.
The reading material, although 
in its scarcity I shouldnt com
plain, has been misdirected. To 
read Colin Turnbulls The Moun
tain People in its entirety and, 
after no more than ten minutes of 
discussion, be tested upon mini
scule facts from one paragraph of 
the book is unproductive and remi
niscent of high school standard
ized tests. The same happened 
with the material on the AIDS 
study. Much of it was interesting, 
much of it was statistically deaf
ening, but to read nearly 200 pages 
of material and use a few facts as 
singular relevant examples of 
what we are presently talking 
about is counter-motivational. 
And then to be tested upon these 
specific facts that could have more
easily been summarized in a one 
page handout is very frustrating 
to the student.
The Decision Making class 
causes me stress because I dont 
see the relevance of it all. What 
disturbs me is that the majority 
of students feel the same way 
that I do, yet their dissatisfaction 
with the course either has; not 
been heard by the administration 
or the implementation of impibvements has been slow.
The structure of the course, I 
understand, is in the developmen
tal stage and in the future, it 
could get better. I hope that for 
the sake of the students, it does.
If you are enrolled in the class 
and you are dissatisfied, please 
let someone know. The only \vay 
for these classes to get better is to 
keep the communication open 
between the faculty and the stu
dents. Expressing anger to your 
best friend does not make the 
course better. Expressing this an
ger to a faculty member might.

Vince Eirene sends a letter from jail in order to explain his motives
An open letter to CMU students 
from the Allegheny County Jail
Dear Students,
It is late at night here at Al
legheny County jail in the heart 
of downtown Pittsburgh. The ma
jority of inmates have grown tired 
of trying to shout back and forth 
between cell blocks and in this 
rare moment of quiet and soli
tude. I would like to share my 
heart with you from this seven by 
:-six cell that will be home for the 
next month. My punishment is 
for not paying a $200 fine for 
when Kevin. Forsythe and I 
chained the doors of SEI on its
first anniversary December 10. 
This is a small price to pay com
pared to others throughout the 
world who fight injustice.
This last Monday I turned 
thirty-seven. It is hard to imagine 
being that old and it being 1989. 
In 1969 I was a junior in high 
school. That spring my classmates 
and I skipped school to join thou
sands who had decided to march 
through the streets of Pittsburgh 
instead of going to work. There 
could be no business as usual with 
four hundred young men (mostly 
black and working class) being 
pulled from Pittsburgh to Viet
nam. My chest filled with enthu
siasm as we cried out for the war 
to stop. That was twenty years 
ago.
Since then much has changed. 
My generation that was outraged 
at the world our parents had left 
us are tom by war and racism. I 
can only ask your forgiveness for 
the confusion we have left you. 
Many left their spasm of morality 
to become obsessed with their own 
comfort and status. The greed of 
my generation will make the 
materialism we protested against 
pale. The unashamed opulence is 
the backdrop for poverty becom
ing more and more evident in our 
urban areas by the growing
number of homeless. Our greed 
has left millions in need. In the 
60s we used to say Let no luxury 
be enjoyed until every need is 
met. But we all must move deeper 
than the memory of an era of 
concern. We must draw new 
strength from what it is to be 
human and spiritual.
Presently we have an arsenal of
50,000 nuclear weapons which is 
capable of destroying the world 
several times over. We produce 
five nuclear weapons daily, none 
as small as the atomic weapons 
that destroyed Hiroshima and 
Nagasaki. These facts are known 
by most and have left most numb
and helpless. We must realize that 
in the face of insurmountable odds 
there are also untold possibili
ties. We are never locked into a 
historical determinism that we 
will inevitably destroy the world. 
Despair is not something we have 
time for. The future generations 
and all of creation groans for us to 
stand up against this injustice.
For the last year and a half a 
few of us have tried to express our 
outrage at your school for playing 
an active part in enhancing the 
the technology that results in the 
destruction of humanity. Weve 
held seminars, revealed the work 
of SEI and pushed for the reveal
ing of on-campus military, re
search. Weve engaged in several 
vigils, fasts and creative acts of 
civil disobedience. We hunger for 
more to join us and welcome your 
thoughts and letters. But even if 
our numbers remain small; our 
hope lies in living a legacy for the 
next generation that some were 
not afraid.
Much love,
Vincent Scotti Eirene

Having just spent the better 
part of an hour looking for a park
ing space, I wonder if the parking 
office would be open to some sug
gestions:
1. Why doesnt Carnegie Mel
lon buy or lease off-site space for 
a parking lot? Most of the hospi
tals in Oakland lease space near 
the old J&L plant for parking and 
have a shuttle service for employ
ees to go back and forth to their 
jobs. The employees pay between 
$20 and $30 a month for this 
service and seem to like it.
-CMU could do the same. They 
already own buses and vans which 
could serve as the shuttles. I am 
sure that most people would be 
thrilled to forget about this park
ing nightmare and appreciate not 
having to feed meters or park 
their cars in the wilds of Schenley 
Park.
2.1 find it rather disturbing to 
drive past the lot at the comer of 
Forbes and Margaret Morrison 
and find it half-empty most of the 
time. Why cant CMU allot 20 or 
30 spaces to people who wish to 
pay for parking on a daily basis? 
It would certainly bring in some 
revenue  the need for which we 
hear about all the time.
Lets face it, the new parking 
garage, whenever it is finished, is 
never going to handle the amount 
of parking needed on the campus. 
Some long term solutions are 
needed for this problem. Even on 
my limited graduate school 
budget, $20 or $30 a month for 
parking is worth the end of aggra
vation for me.
Hey parking office  Any re
sponse?

thanks to all those who have given 
me their encouragement and 
support. I am very moved by their 
kind efforts. I also think it impor
tant to note that many of those 
expressing support for me raised 
broader concerns regarding the 
quality of undergraduate teach
ing at CMU. I share these con
cerns and, whatever the outcome 
in my individual case, I hope the 
faculty and administration will 
give them serious consideration.

ments that might be worked out.
Without going into the details of 
the alternatives here, I now have 
the option of teaching at CMU at 
least through the next year. There 
is also some possibility of a more 
long-term arrangement. Since I 
was planning to leave after this 
year, I applied for teaching posi
tions elsewhere and I am still 
waiting to hear from several 
schools. Before deciding what to 
do, I think it best to wait and see 
what my other options are.
I want to express my sincerest
Sophomore says Eirene

student body, alone and find a 
better way of working on his 
misguided causes. Granted his 
work for the homeless is respect

where he is inept alone and get 
away from the issue of defense

At IBM,outstanding people dont stand still.
S
o you always thought IBMers were 
a bunch of blue striped suits 
with buttoned down minds. ,
Nothing could be further 'TJpft*. f 
from the truth.
Theyre movers and shakers.
Energetic, ambitious and smart. People 
who know where theyre going and 
get there fast. People with ideas who choose 
IBM because they know their ideas will 
be heard and put into action.
Thats right. The winds of change are 
sweeping the vast corporate infrastructure of 
IBM. Todays IBM is a leaner, more streamlined 
operation that reacts more quickly. Weve broken 
through the layers of bureaucracy to create a 
company that takes more risks... is closer to 
the customer.. . and encourages IBMers to 
speak up, challenge old ways of thinking 
and initiate new ideas.
This is not a company that simply rests on its 
past successes. Were sharing our blueprint for the 
future with both our staff and competitors.
Weve become more robust, //
expanding with the market- , Mr 
\ place... and even developing
\ products that easily hook up |
\ with systems outside the
IBM environment.
I see unlimited 
opportunities for 
advancement at 
IBM.. .both in the 
technical and 
managerial ranks.
Wi have our share of 
technical challenges 
and our share of the 
right people to meet 
them. Professionals 
who are committed 
to quality and excel
lence in all they do. 
And by the way, 
they know how to 
have fun too.

After all, were the worldwide leader in

At IBM, youll be at the heart of the informa

the responsibility you can handle. Work in small 
project teams with the newest computer-aided

from image processing to laser-fiber optics... 
from robotics and computer controlled
At IBM I can be

the same company.
Where the people are 
high achievers with big

I would not change it for

and satellite transmission. Applying the latest 
information technologies. . .and working 
alongside some of the industrys brightest 
programmers, engineers and scientists 
in all fields.
Youll earn early recognition and have the 
opportunity for exposure to multiple projects. At 
IBM, no idea is too small to reach managements 
ear and get quick response.
Youll have plenty of room to grow because 
were a company that promotes from within. 
IBMers have the option to move from one area to 
another.. .to relocate to a variety of sites... 
and to follow a career track along purely 
technical lines or into management. All the 
while moving up just as fast and as far as 
your talent will take you.
The thing that 
gets me going 
the most is the 
possibilities, the 
endless possibilities. 
This is a company 
where I can, within 
reason, call my own 
shots about my 
future. If I want to 
develop a career as 
a top-level IBM 
manager, I can do 
that. If I want to 
become an IBM 
Fellow eventually, I 
can make that hap
pen too. Career 
development at 
IBM is primarily 
the responsibility of 
the individual; the 
manager is there to 
facilitate and coun
sel. Having that 
degree of control 
over my own future 
career is exciting.

The most exciting 
thing about IBM is 
that were trying to be 
a different company than we 
were ten years ago, or even last

temporary assignments within or outside IBM.
And theres more. IBM encourages its family 
of professionals to exceed their own expectations.
At all levels, IBMers may receive recognition 
and financial awards for outstanding contri

prestige of meeting and exceeding 
unusual challenges keep both IBM and 
its people growing and moving ahead.
Never has there been a more exciting time to

The great thing about the

'someone has only a few such

Cold, wet, April weather has interrupted the 
beginning of the mens tennis season, but it hasnt 
cramped their performance. Due to the weather, 
the Tartans were forced to postpone matches against 
Hiram and Washington and Jefferson (W&J), but 
they have been successful in their Sunday matches 
against Duquesne and John Carroll (JCU). They 
defeated JCU, 8-1, last Sunday and Duquesne, 6-3, 
the week before.
Senior Jay Stevens clinched the number four 
singles match against John Carrolls Greg Suher, 
which won the match for CMU.
Along with Stevens, five of the six team members 
won their matches in a contribution to the overall 
victory against JCU. Graham McAfee defeated John 
Carrolls Jamie Lynch for the number one singles 
spot with a final score of 6-7, 6-2, 6-2. Also in the 
winners circle were Keith Grumet 6-3, 6-4, Darin 
Kaplan 7-6, 6-0, and Matt Davis 6-2, 6-2.
In the doubles matches, Carnegie Mellon contin
ued its string of great playing. McAfee and Grumet 
defeated John Carrolls number one doubles team 
by the score of 7-5, 6-4. Kaplan and Stevens de
feated their opponents with a 6-4, 6-0 final score. 
The number three doubles spot was taken by the 
combination of Sagna and Rick Lee, with a final tie 
breaking score of 7-6.
McAfee, who beat Grumet in a challenge match 
for the number one singles position, lost a close 
match against Duquesnes Troy Turkin, one of the 
citys best players, 3-6,6-7. Grumet won the number 
two singles match, 6-1, 6-0.

Coach Rich Scheines spoke about his two top 
players. Graham is playing particularly well right 
now. He has really jumped a level. Keith is a very 
reliable player and does well under pressure. 
Theyre really closely matched. And theyre both 
fantastic.
The other two losses were suffered by number 
four singles, Stevens, 3-6, 4-6, and number six 
singles, Davis, 4-6, 6-3, 1-6. Kaplan won the num
ber three singles match, 7-6, 4-6, 6-1, and Sagna 
defeated his opponent, 6-2,6-3, in the number five 
singles match.
Scheines is optimistic about the rest of the sea
son. Darin is playing well, but hasnt hit his peak 
yet. Matt Davis is also coming around very nicely. 
Nicholas and Jay are still not playing at the peak 
of their game, but I expect them to be within the 
next week.
The doubles teams were undefeated against 
Duquesne. We swept the doubles which was really 
good, Scheines stated. MacAfee and Grumet won 
the number one doubles, 6-2, 7-5. Kaplan and 
Stevens won the number two doubles, 6-5,6-2, and 
the number three doubles match was won by Sagna 
and Lee, 6-2, 2-6, 7-6.
Scheines commented on the teams star doubles 
player, Rick Lee is a big asset to the team as an 
excellent doubles player. Hes probably on of the 
best doubles players on the team.
According to Scheines, the Hilton Head excur
sion went extremely well. We played some really 
tough matches against some really good teams. 
This just shows that were only a step away from 
being competitive on a national level. With a little 
more practice and experience well be very tough!

The Carnegie Mellon mens 
track team concluded their dual 
meet season last Saturday with a 
tough victory at Grove City Col
lege . Coming off easy wins against 
Bethany College, 118-27, and 
Washington and Jefferson Col
lege (W&J), 115-30, the Tartans 
needed a win in the 4x400 meter 
relay  the final event of the 
meet  against Grove City to 
finish their season undefeated. 
The final score read Carnegie 
Mellon 77.5, Grove City 67.5
Against Bethany and W&J, the 
Tartans showed their strengths 
in the field event. Sam Lui was a 
double winner in the long and 
triple jumps, while Chris Luckett 
took the high jump. Tom Dale 
won both the shot put and the 
javelin, and Paul Joyce took first 
in the discus.
On the track, Jeff Illian cap
tured wins in the 100 and 200 
meter dashes. Dave Supp coasted 
to an easy victory in the 1500 
meter. Rich Shipley won the 110 
meter hurdles, and Bill Corcoran 
took the 400 intermediate 
hurdles. Wins by Len ONeal in 
the 800 meter dash and Pat Noll 
in the 5000 meter run closed out
the individual track events for 
CMU. Corcoran, Shipley, Chris 
Cyrus and Illian won the 4x100 
meter relay, and ONeal, Colin 
Jones, and Scott Forest and Chris 
Ruiz took first place in the 4x400 
meter relay.
Saturdays meet was not as easy 
for the Tartans. However, they 
were fortunate to have more aces 
in the hole than the Wolverines of 
Grove City did. Illian was run
ning in high gear, winning both 
the 100 and 200 meter dashes in 
11.05 and 22.7 seconds, respec
tively, and anchoring both first 
place relay teams. Supp contin
ued his winning ways, taking first 
place in the 1500 meter race, with 
a time of 4:06 minutes, and the 
5000 meter run and also also 
helping ONeal and Forest sweep 
the 800 meter dash. Shipley came 
through once again in the hurdle 
events, capturing the 110 meter 
high hurdles and placing third in 
the 400 meter relay. The final 
running hero for the Tartans was 
Cyrus. Like Illian, he contributed 
to both winning relays and also 
won the 400 meter dash.
In the field events, points were 
also hard to come by. Dale 
squeezed out a second and third 
place in the shot put and javelin, 
respectively. Luckett was once
again victorious in the high jump, 
clearing the bar at 6 feet, 4 inches. 
The Tartans Setson and Relly 
pulled out a first and second in 
the discus, Stetson throwing for 
128 feet, 7 inches and Kelly for 
123 Feet, 11 inches. Shannon 
McKibbon also proved to be an 
ace for the Tartans, winning the 
javelin with a throw of 158 feet, 
10 inches, taking third in the long 
jump, and pulling out a tie for 
third in the pole vault.
The meet, as well as the unde
feated season, came down to the 
4x400 meter relay, and the Tar
tan relay team responded. ONeal 
kept things even through the first 
leg of the relay. In handing off the 
baton to Jones, the Tartans were 
able to jump in front of the Grove 
City team. Cyrus and Illian, the 
final two legs of the relay, never 
looked back.
Although the dual meet victory 
and the undefeated season are 
now in hand, the Tartans still 
have some work to do. The PAC 
Championships at John Carroll 
University still loom in the dis
tance, as do the UAA Champion
ships at Case Western Reserve 
University. The Tartans will tavel 
to California, Pennsylvania this 
weekend to compete in the Cali
fornia University Invitational.

The Carnegie Mellon 
womens track team travelled 
to Hiram last Saturday to par
ticipate in the Hiram Invita
tional, and to catch a glimpse 
of what would await them at 
the Presidents Athletic Con
ference (PAC) Championships. 
Five PAC schools entered the 
competition, and the Tartans 
came home with a split - los
ing to Grove City College 
(GCC) and John Carroll Uni
versity (JCU), while defeating 
the host team Hiram and 
Bethany College. The overall 
score of the meet was: GCC, 
167; JCU, 163; CMU, 96; 
Hiram, 41; and Bethany, 21.
The Lady Tartans were led 
by Lisa Schmidt, who finished 
the meet with the highest to
tal of points among all of the 
athletes. Schmidt captured 
victories in the 200 meter and 
400 meter dashes. She helped 
the Tartans 4x100 meter re
lay to a second place finish. 
Also running the relay were 
Julia Wright, Charsetta 
Grant, and Jody Burig.
Schmidt placed fourth in the 
high jump, and rounded out 
her day by anchoring the Tar
tans winning 4x400 meter 
relay.
Also shining for the Lady 
Tartans was Susan Wempa, 
who broke school records in 
both the long jump and triple 
jump. In the longjump, Wempa 
broke the record with a second 
place distance of 15 feet, 8.75 
inches. She earned another 
second place in the triple jump, 
reaching the distance of 36 feet, 
2.5 inches.
Other top finishers for the 
Lady Tartans were Carolyn 
Lowe in the 300 meter race, 
Lois Raska in the 800 meter 
dash, and Wright in the inter
mediate hurdles.
With a good look at their up
coming competition for the 
PAC Championships, the Lady 
Tartans now know what must 
be done in order for them to 
capture the PAC crown.
This week, the Lady Tartans 
will be facing Robert Morris 
College and Duquesne Univer
sity on Thursday, the Califor
nia University Invitational on 
Saturday.

I smell blood, stated one spec
tator while watching the IM floor 
hockey play-offs, which started 
last week. In the first round of 
competition in the minors divi
sion, No Equipment played 
NROTC-A.
The scoring started late in the 
first period when David Pfalzgraf 
of NROTC-A broke away from the 
pack and sent the puck into the 
No Equipment net from 20 feet.
About two minutes later, Char
lie Jankowski, lost his defender 
and went one-on-one against the 
NROTC goalie. He tied the game 
with a shot that slid past the 
goalie into the left side of the net.
The second period began with 
two shots on the No Equipment 
goal, the second of which, taken 
by Pfalzgraf, went into the net, 
giving NROTC the lead, 2-1. 
Almost three minutes later, No 
Equipment scored again to tie the 
game at two.
With three minutes left in the 
second period, Todd Cignetti of 
No Equipment scored giving his
team the lead for the first time. 
With seconds left on the clock, 
NROTC had the puck in front of 
No Equipments goal, but lost 
their chance to tie the game, when 
they held the puck instead of 
shooting it.
The teams started the third 
period concentrating on defense 
rather than offense. With over 
half of the final period over, 
Pfalzgraf scored his third goal of 
the game. About a minute later, 
Jankowski scored again, giving 
No Equipment the lead, 4-3.
At the two minute mark, 
Pfalzgraf scored his fourth and 
final goal of the evening. Neither 
team scored in regulation, so the 
game went into overtime.
Less than a minute had passed 
before Richard Loy scored the 
game winning goal for NROTC, 
which advanced NROTC-A to the 
next round of the finals where 
they face the number one seed in 
Division D.
Thursday night, NROTC-A 
went up against first place the 
Moose Jaw Warriors. The action 
started early when Jim White 
scored a goal, giving Moose Jaw
the lead, 1-0.
The first period ended with two 
more Moose Jaw goals, both cred
ited to James Quinlan, and a 
NROTC goal scored by Richard 
Loy. The second period was simi
lar to the first in many respects. 
At the end of two, the Moose Jaw 
Warriors were up by a score of 5- 
1. Moose Jaw had forty shots on 
goal while NROTC had eighteen.
The third period commenced 
with a comeback attempt by 
NROTC. In the first half of the 
third period, NROTC scored two 
goals, while Moose Jaw was tem
porarily shut down. With over 
three minutes left, Moose Jaw 
scored their sixth goal thanks to 
Quinlan. A few seconds later, 
NROTC replied with another Loy 
goal, making the score a close 6-4.
With a little over a minute in 
regular play left, Moose Jaw 
clinched the victory with an easy 
shot. In the remaining time, 
Moose Jaw scored two more times 
giving them the chance to ad
vance to the championship game 
April 10. In the third period, 
NROTC outshot Moose Jaw 
Warriors 17-14.

Reds expected to break string of second place finishes
By JASON MCDONALD
fartanStaffwriter
The fourth in a series previewthis seasons baseball teams, 
week, the National League 
West.
This
,SL)
Cincinnati Reds: Every year, 
Reds enter the season favored 
win the division, and they 
Jways respond by finishing sec,nd. This year should break that 
itreak. The Reds possibly have 
seballs best offense, and their 
litching isnt too bad either.
The pitching staff starts with 
Danny Jackson and Tom Browntwo of the best left-handed 
litchers in baseball. Jose Rijo is 
oming back strong after several 
i\vful years in Oakland, but the 
ury is still out on whether he can 
natch his 1988 performance. Rich 
Mahler rounds out the Reds four 
nan rotation, and should do much 
letter now that hes been removed 
om Atlantas Fulton County 
Jtadium, a pitchers nightmare. 
The relief is supplied mainly by 
ohn Franco, the best stopper in 
he NL, but Francos support cast 
equally impressive. The deparures of Frank Williams and Rob 
tfurphy left the Reds without a 
et-up man, so they acquired freegent Kent Tekulve, but young
sters Rob Dibble and Norm 
harlton will have to pull part of 
he load this season.
The real strength of the Reds, 
lowever, is in their offense, 
idmittedly, catcher is a bit un
stable with the injury to Bo Diaz, 
iut very few teams have quality 
etching. First baseman Todd 
tenzinger is a statistical clone of 
iick Esasky, the man he was 
raded for, but Benzinger has a 
otmore potential and should give 
he Reds around 20 homers. Secnd baseman Ron Oester is the 
iiman interest story of the team, 
oming back successfully from a 
ear career-ending injury two seaons ago. Shortstop Barry Larkin 
nd third baseman Chris Sabo 
re two of the brightest young
stars in baseball; both have bet
ter than average power and blaz
ing speed.
The outfield took a bit of a drop 
in ability when the Reds decided 
that Tracy Jones didnt fit into 
their plans, but the Reds still have 
a quality trio. Center fielder Eric 
Davis is the best player in the 
game when hes healthy because 
no other player can star in so 
many different ways. Kal Daniels 
is almost equal to Davis in ability, 
but is often overshadowed in the 
media coverage. Right fielder Paul 
ONeill isnt as flashy as Davis 
and Daniels, but he does provide 
solid defense and decent power. 
Playing full-time will help ONeill 
even more. The bench is rather 
thin, but veterans like Ken Grif
fey and Dave Collins should help 
the younger players develop, as 
well as contribute on the field.
Los Angeles Dodgers: The 
Dodgers enter 1989 with several 
glaring weaknesses; no leadoff 
hitter, lack of bench depth, and 
overachievers on the pitching 
staff. However the heart of the 
team is still there, starting with 
the pitching staff. Orel Hershiser 
should be one of the best pitchers 
in the league, even if he wont 
quite repeat last years perform
ance. Tim Leary and Tim Belcher 
proved themselves to be quality 
starters last season, but neither 
has the career stats to support 
stardom. Rookie Ramon Marti
nez should get a lot of innings this 
year with John Tudor on the shelf 
until June, and Fernando 
Valenzuela may surprise a lot of 
people who think he is already 
washed up. The bullpen, on the 
other hand, is questionable this 
season. Stopper Jay Howell may 
be receiving a lot of glove checks 
after last years playoff suspen
sion, and the Dodgers dont have 
anyone to take up the slack if 
Howell falters. Alejandro Pena is 
reliable, but theres only so much 
he can do to help. The rest of the 
pen is built out of drifters like 
Ricky Horton, so the Dodgers may 
be in trouble in the late innings.
The infield was improved 
greatly by the addition of Eddie 
Murray. The ex-Oriole first base
man should hit 30 homers, and 
take some offensive pressure off 
of MVP Kirk Gibson. The advan
tage gained by acquiring Murray 
was nullified by the loss of Steve 
Sax. Sax, a competent leadoff 
hitter, will be replaced by Willie 
Randolph, who has neither the 
speed nor the hitting ability of 
Sax. Shortstop Alfredo Griffin 
should get the job again by de
fault, but Mariano Duncan has 
been moved back to the majors in 
case Griffin falters again this year. 
Third base will be held by the 
hydra-like Jeff HamiltonTracy 
WoodsonDuncanDave An
derson combination, since none of 
them have starting ability.
The outfield is going to be up in 
the air until Gibson proves hes 
fully recovered from his injuries 
of last season. Gibson, a .290 hit
ter with 25 homers, is also a 
menace on the bases, picking up 
31 steals. Center fielder John 
Shelby may be the leadoff hitter 
because of streaks of brilliance he
showed last season, including a 
24-game hitting streak. Unfortu
nately, Shelby shows surprisingly 
little base speed for a center 
fielder. Right fielder Mike 
Marshall should play well now 
that hes back in the outfield. Last 
year, he suffered with injuries 
and a highly reluctant tour of 
duty at first base, but this season 
seems to be free of strife. World 
Series hero Mickey Hatcher is 
about the only competent player 
on the bench for the Dodgers, but 
players like Woodson and Dun
can are young and have potential.
Atlanta Braves: This is NOT 
a joke. Finishing last for all these 
years has stockpiled a solid pitch
ing staff in Richmond(AAA) that 
should make a serious bid for 
contention. Most people fail to 
realize that the Bravesteam ERA 
is so high because they play 81 
games in one of Americas pre
mier hitters parks. Theyre not 
really as bad as it looks. John 
Smoltz, Derek Lilliquist, Pete 
Smith, and Tom Glavine give the 
Braves four great young starters, 
and Zane Smith may have a re
bound year now that some of the 
pressure to perform has been 
removed. The bullpen is filled with 
underrated castaways like Char
lie Puleo, Jim Acker, Mark 
Eichhom, and Joe Boever. Boever 
should be the stopper at least 
until free-agent Dwayne Henry 
proves hes ready. The acquisi
tion of catcher Jody Davis should 
help ease the younger pitchers 
along until theyre ready for star
dom.
The infield has great promise 
for 1989. Gerald Perry, a former 
backup outfielder has become one 
of the leagues best hitters after 
becoming the Braves starting first 
baseman. Second base should be 
shared by Jeff Blauser and exRed Jeff Treadway, both of whom 
showed great potential in the 
minor leagues. Shortstop Andres 
Thomas is a legitimate star, as 
shown by the great number of 
teams that made offers for him 
during the off-season, and third 
baseman Ron Gant is only an iron 
glove away from being a star, but 
experience should help cure the 
error bug. Darrell Evans, who 
came over from the Tigers, may 
be getting old, but still has some 
power left in his bat.
The outfield has the building 
blocks in place for contention. Left 
fielder Lonnie Smith, who suc
cessfully battled drugs, may never 
be the player he was in the early 
80s, but he still has enough speed 
to fill the void left by the depar
ture of Albert Hall. Geronimo 
Berroa and Tommy Gregg, the 
center field tandem, both put up 
great numbers in the minor 
leagues before coming to Atlanta. 
Right fielder Dale Murphy had 
an off year in batting average, but 
still has plenty of power and 
should see more good pitches now 
that he cant be pitched around as 
much.
San Francisco Giants: The
Giants are entering 1989 in a 
state of confusion. The pitching 
staff is being almost completely 
shuffled around, third baseman 
Kevin Mitchell is being shifted
out to the outfield, and both of the 
Giants catchers from last season 
are in the American Leagu. 
However, if any team can handle 
the changes, its the Giants. Th[e 
pitching staff is still a good on6, 
even if its being overhauled. Rick 
Reuschel and Kelly Downs give 
the Giants two competent pitch
ers, but the rest of the rotation is 
in pieces. Don Robinson should 
get one spot after a great per
formance in the rotation late la$t 
season. Reliever Scott Garrelts 
will switch spots with starter Mike 
LaCoss, after both were disap
pointing in their roles last sea
son. Veteran Mike Krukow still 
has a good arm, and can be relied 
upon as a fifth starter. The bull
pen will be anchored by LaCos 
and Craig Lefferts, but the middle 
relief is miserable. Joe Price anjd 
Atlee Hammaker should nail 
down spots in middle and long 
relief this season. Catching will 
be handled mostly by youngster 
Kirt Manwaring.
The Giants do have the best 
pure power hitter in first base
man Will Clark, but the infield 
has problems everywhere else. 
Third baseman Matt Williams ^s 
being thrown into the hole va
cated by Mitchell even though hje 
has little major league experience. 
Second basemen Robby Th
ompson and Jose Uribe are con
sistent starters, but neither will 
be playing on an all-star team 
any time soon.
The outfield starts with Brett 
Butler, the best leadoff man in 
baseball. Butler is a great hitter 
and bunte!rras well as an extraor
dinary fielder; look for Butler ijo 
be on the All-Star team, even if 
only as a backup. Right fielder 
Candy Maldonado has spent the 
last three seasons making tbje 
Dodgers regret getting rid of him 
and this year will be more salt i| 
the wounds. As a regular, Maldi 
nado has blossomed into a full 
fledged power threat, and hitting 
after Will Clark certainly helps. 
Mitchells career is much the same

brtan Assistant Sports Editor
The University Rowing Club pulled a triumphant weekend from up 
s sleeve in a local scrimmage against Pitt and Duquesne. Under the 
irection of coach Liz Winter, all of Carnegie Mellons boats placed in 
ieir respective races.
The course was a rough one for the rowers. Flood conditions on the 
llegheny River brought about the added challenge of speeds up to 
iree times faster than the competitors are accustom to. Both the 
KC and Duquesne raced eight crews in the scrimmage and Pitt 
itered four crews.
Despite the difficulties, the rowing club swept through the Mens 
ovice division taking three out of the first four positions. The boat 
fled by Shawn Ohler, Brian Carter, Hans Wang, Peter Chan, and 
ie cox Sue Olyamik captured the number one spot in the race. Rudy 
mg, Bill Posega, Peter Blossey, Kevin Goldsmith, and cox Sophie 
hiang finished second. Coxed by Joyce Alba, Rich Christie, Burky 
hiang, Mark Thomson, and Matt Wagner aided in the CMU domi
nion of of the novice mens division by holding on strong at fourth 
ace. Duquesne was the third place finisher in the race.
The Lightweight Mens competition was exciting, not only because 
arnegie Mellon placed third, but because of the action on the water, 
eading toward the finishing line, the URC boat was in second place, 
ta clash of oars with Duquesne found them finishing in third. Pitt 
as the victor in this division. Rowing in this boat were Thomas 
oeffel, Posega, Harry Printz, Ted Lehr, and cox Rudy Zung. 
Asecond place win in the HeavyweightMens division was a signifiuit win for the rowers. The boat of Dan Ross, Glenn Pasewicz, Ohler, 
^ Ralphs, and cox Chiangfinished the race between boats from Pitt 
id Duquesne. It was significant for the men because Duquesnes 
has been competing on the regular rowing circuit for almost two 
iars now.
1 didnt think that they had the skill to beat them in the water. We 
M together until about half way. Pitt pulled away, and then, CMU 
lied away. It was a great finish in the first really tough race, said 
inter.
The women did not let the men sweep up all the awards in this 
fimmage. In the first race of the Novice Womens division CMU 
iced second behind Duquesne. The boat oared by Marta FuenJtoa, Liz Gross, Sohee Chung, Robin Garber, and cox Sue Olyamik 
Jught a crab on an oar, but came back nicely to beat Pitt, said 
inter.
in the second race in the division, CMU rowed away to first place 
a close and exciting match. It was not until the 50 meters thatTerry 
'"loud, Denise Visconti, Cheri Soriano, Anna Loney and cox Peter 
nan pulled together to come in ahead of the strong Pitt and 
nquesne boats.
Everyone did really well, especially the coxes. It was a really tough 
Urse because the water was fast and they had to steer the boats 
und a bridge without losing any ground. That put a lot of pressure 
them, stated Winter.

as Maldonados; after being traded 
away, Mitchell has responded 
with great power numbers. Tracy 
Jones, a combination of speed, 
power, and great fielding, will be 
the fourth outfielder; however, 
look for Mitchell to move back to 
third and Jones to start by June.
San Diego Padres: Its hard 
to understand why everyone feels 
compelled to give the division to 
the Padres so quickly. Anyone 
with half a brain can figure that 
the players the Padres picked up 
arent going to help that much. 
Bruce Hurst is a good pitcher, but 
hes not going to be the next Cy 
Young. Walt Terrell may even 
turn out to be a better pitcher 
than Hurst. Eric Show will pro
vide his consistent 15-win sea
son, but the last spots in the rota
tion are risky. Eddie Whitson led 
the league in giving up the longball two seasons ago, so I find it 
hard to believe that he can hold 
together as well as last season. 
Dennis Rasmussen could have a 
good season if he can ride the tail 
end of last season; hes in trouble 
if he reverts to his usual self.
Mark Davis is one of the most 
dominating closers in the game, 
but the rest of the bullpen is sus
pect. Dave Leiper had a good 
season but doesnt figure to get a 
lot of work. Mark Grant will be 
used as the right-handed stopper, 
but Grant has never produced up 
to his much-hyped potential. Greg 
Booker and Greg Harris round 
out the bullpen, but neither is 
much of a standout.
The infield is in a state of tran
sition. Catcher Benito Santiago is 
coming off of a disappointing 
season after a great rookie year, 
but has played very well this 
spring. Roberto Alomar has fi
nally been given the starting job
at second after splitting time 
between San Diego and Las Ve
gas for the last few seasons. First 
base has been turned over to free 
agent Jack Clark, who will proba
bly spend forty or fifty games on 
the disabled list if his past holds 
true. Shortstop Garry Templeton 
would have been out of a job a few 
seasons ago, except that the 
Padres dont really have anyone 
else. Third base will be given to 
Randy Ready at the start of the 
season, but ex-Tiger Luis Salazar 
should get a lot of time there over 
the course of the season.
The outfield will once again be 
anchored by batting champ Tony 
Gwynn, who should have a big 
year after a disappointing 1988 
season, at least by Gwynns per
sonal standards. The rest of the 
outfield is up in the air, although 
surprise star Marvell Wynne and 
John Kruk, one of 1988s biggest 
nose-dives, are the early favor
ites for starting jobs. Clark and 
Carmelo Martinez should also see 
time in the outfield.
Houston Astros: The Astros 
are in big trouble, but they have 
done a great job of keeping it 
quiet. The problems start with 
pitching; Jim Deshaies is the most 
competent pitcher on their staff, 
and Mike Scott is still a strong 
pitcher, even though his ability 
has gone downhill since the scuff
ing allegations started. From 
there, though, things get ugly. 
Bob Knepper is getting into the 
autumn years of his career and 
his durability is reduced, but he 
may still have one season left in 
his arm. Rick Rhoden and Jim 
Clancy are both over the hill and 
cant be counted on for an entire 
season. The bullpen is anchored 
by the aging Dave Smith, and 
underrated middle reliever Larry 
Andersen, but there is no depth if
Smiths age catches up with him. 
Alan Ashby, another senior citi
zen will catch until Craig Biggio 
is ready to take over the job. I
First baseman Glenn DaVismust stay awake at night won
dering where he might be if! he 
played in a hitters park. Consid
ering that he managed 30 homers 
in the Astrodome, the possibili
ties are astounding if he were to 
play in say, Wrigley Field. Second 
baseman Bill Doran had an :injury-plagued year, so he should 
return to his superstar form this 
year. Rafael Ramirez returned 
from nowhere to start at short
stop, but his magic may be run
ning out. Third base is open to 
just about anyone, but Ken Caminiti or Chuck Jackson should be 
the starter. However, neither will 
be able to hold the job for long.
Kevin Bass has had a FOR 
SALE sign stapled to him !by 
management ever since he joiiied 
the Astros, but it hasnt had any 
strong effect on his play. Even 
though he usually hits .280 with 
20 homers and 30 steals, this year 
maybe the one where Bass finally 
gets dealt. The rest of the outfield 
looks to be relatively unproduc
tive. Billy Hatcher, the left fielder, 
wasnt much of a number two 
hitter; he should be even less 0f a 
third man since he has little power 
and hitting ablilty. Hatcher, is 
more suited for a leadoff position 
or one low in the order. He woint
go low in the order because hes 
>pfthe best they have for the top of 
the order, and he wont lead .off 
because of Gerald Young. Young 
has great speed, but wont be a 
star because, as the saying goes, 
You cant steal first base. Terry 
Puhl and rookie prospect 
Cameron Drew will be the ba :kups, but Puhl is too old, and Drew 
is inexperienced.

The booths on the Midway 
also represent many hours of 
work for the participants. The 
theme thisyearisToyland; Car

into a huge playground for the 
average 20 year old child.
Also incorporated into the 
Carnival scene, the varied 
musical talents scheduled to 
perform promise to draw large 
crowds. The musical perform
ances start with Carnegie Mellons own Kiltie Band at 5 pm 
and the NY City Swing Band at
9 pm on Thursday. Other bands 
to appear include Wattz, Boil

Deadly By Desire, the Flow, 
and Til Tuesday.
One of the newest attractions 
of this years Carnival will be 
the Arts and Crafts Show. 
Approximately thirty-five dif
ferent craftsmen will be dis
playing and offering for sale 
their wares.
The craftsmen will consist of 
students and several people 
from the Pittsburgh area. On 
sale will be i tems ranging from 
tie-dye T-shirts to jewelry. The 
Arts and Crafts committee 
hopes that this will become an 
annual event for Carnival.
Other events include Scotch

several opportunities to indulge 
in free food. The Navy ROTC 
drill team will also give a per

The face of the campus is start
ing to show the signs of Spring 
Carnival. The fraternities and 
sororities, among the other participatingorganizations, are busy 
putting the finishing touches on 
booths; push practices are occuring at more regular intervals. 
In this section, abuggy driver de
scribes a day in her life during 
freerolls. Everyone is anticipat
ing the upcoming competition.
Even the Carnival Planning 
Committee will begin putting up 
the tent and Carnival rides soon.
The sign in the Skibo parking lot 
warning of the imminent seizure 
remind students of yet another 
parking crisis in the making.
This years Carnival promises 
somethingforeveryone, complete 
with an arts and crafts show and 
a laser show, both new to the 
festivities.
The Midway will open at 4:30 
pm on Thursday, April 13, but 
even before this time there will 
be event accessable to the public. 
Starting at 9 am and continuing 
until noon, the Skibo Informa
tion desk will offer advance-sales 
ride tickets. Also starting at 9 
am, but continuing until 3 pm, 
the gym will be the sight of the 
Buggy Display and design competetion.

Compubookie strikes again
Editors note: Here it is, folks. 
Since the Features staff discov
ered such overwhelming support 
for this Sweepstakes tradition, 
we are very happy to present the 
1989 Compubookie Spring Car
nival Sweepstakes preview.
As in past years, the mysterious 
Compubookie prefers to keep his, 
her, or its identity a secret, even 
from the Tartan staff, but, as al
ways, these predictions found 
their way to the Tartan office in 
time for the Carnival preview 
issue.
With a new buggy record set in 
Sweepstakes 1988,1 predict that 
Sweepstakes 1989 will prove to 
be much more competitive than 
the Buggy competitions of the 
past.
Spirits record settingperformance turned a few heads, not to 
mention windows. Their first 
victory, in 1987, was termed a 
fluke; however, there were no 
clouds" over the second victorylast year.
I guess that the most appli
cable question is, Can they do it 
again? Perhaps, with four vet
eran pushers and a sleek, recordsettingbuggy they can, provided, 
of course, thatthey can get them
selves organized.
But Sigmu Nu has been win
ning the freerolls lately, and if 
they can manage to keep out of 
the hay for a second year, then 
they, too, have an excellent 
chance for a victory.
Pending any disaster, Im sure 
that either Pi Kappa Alpha or 
Beta Theta Pi would be more 
than happy to carry the trophy 
home.
The Kappa Alpha Theta girls 
were regular animals last year, 
pushing their way to a victory 
over the returning champions, 
Spirit.
Again, the only organization I 
see anywhere near in the same 
league as this years Theta team 
is the Spirit team. With greater 
organization and a little more 
practice, I would Watch out for 
Theta!"
In the spring, new buggies seem 
to sprout out of the ground like
weeds; however, that spring rain 
is not quite so beneficial to these 
same buggies.
With new entries from Beta, 
Delta Upsilon, Kappa Delta Rho, 
Fringe, and, perhaps, even Spirit, 
this years top ten are definitely 
going to be much faster than 
ever. That is, of course, if they can 
get their required ten rolls in.
The rain, in clippingoffthe num
ber of possible freerolls, has forced 
organizations to spend less time 
in training runs, and to go right 
for the gusto instead, or in several 
cases, right into haybales and 
curbs.
The chow-toll has been tre
mendous this year, but just wait 
for race-day.
On a positive note, one impor
tant safety concern has been 
remedied; namely two-wheel 
buggy designs  there are none 
in operation as of this Spring Car
nival.
Early this year, Chris Hansen, 
the Sweepstakes Chairman, as a 
concession to pressure from 
above made the decision to ban 
these two-wheel buggies after con
secutive DU crashes in 1987 and 
1988.
So, pray for sun and at least 70 
degree temperatures, and take 
up a seat in the chute. The show is 
about to begin:Sweepstakes 1989.
Mens Predictions:
1) Sigma Nu ' Another good 
year through the chute could 
mean VICTORY
2) Spirit  Last year was 
Spirits Quantum Leap
3) Pika  A breath of fresh air 
should put them in contention
4) B etaIf they even bother to 
show up for the race day
5) Fringe  With a little help 
from ATO
6) KDR  If they dont blow it
7) Pika B  As usual
8) Spirit B  A second year in 
the top 10
9) Theta Xi  If Sigmu Nu 
leads them through the chute
10)CIAIs their Magicfinally 
gone?
WomensPredictions:
1) Pika(Theta)
2) Spirit
3) Who cares?
Alumni Predictions:
1) SweepBtakes Committee
2) Sigmu Nu
3) Pika
Organizations:
CIA  Some things just dont 
get better with age.
Fringe Go ATO!
KDR  Contrary to popular 
belief, you do, in fact, need tires to 
be able to successfully make the 
chute.
Pioneers  Well, maybe a good 
call for a design win, but the real 
question is if the Pioneers can 
come through into the top third 
finish.
ATO  Go Fringe!
SDC A woman buggy chair
man, need I say more!
Pika  A bit too much whis
key, country music and hay has 
taken the luster off the crown.
Beta  With a manufacturing 
plant in Delaware, these Guys 
are a little far away.
DU  Three wheels are better 
than two... but maybe not in this 
case.
PhiKap  No contest. See you 
at Seven Springs.
DTD  The men are putting on 
their new Derbies and going for a 
spin on the town.
Sigmu Nu  They have tried 
the Force, are they now moving to 
the Dark Side, or should I say, the 
Black Market?
Air Force  Their follow car 
even gets passed.
Pilam  If no one throws a 
WRENCH into the works of their 
organization!
Spirit  Now that plans for a 
new buggy have gone sour, the 
third time wont necessarily be a 
charm.
SAE  Congratulations on 
Greek Sing.
KappaSig Ifthey cantmake 
a decent showing this year, the 
Kappa Sig buggy program might 
just be retiring along with their 
cook.
Theta Xi  Their drivers will 
be a question mark for the Theta 
Xi this year. Too bad you cant 
buy buggy drivers.

Sweepstakes Safety explored
By JOEY LYNN MONACO
Tartan Features Editor
Amidst the frantic last-minute 
Spring Carnival preparations on 
all comers of the campus, the 
Buggy program also has its 
procedures.
This is the time of year that the 
buggy organizations on campus 
are rewarded with the fruits of 
their labors on the racing course. 
But first they must submit all ve
hicles to the safety tests conducted 
by the Carnival Planning Com
mittee, due to serious buggy acci
dents in the history of the Buggy 
races.
Before a buggy can even freeroll, 
it must pass several safety tests. 
First of all, the buggy must pass a 
visually-performed safety inspec
tion by the Sweepstakes safety 
chairman. Then there are two 
tests where the buggy must dem
onstrate its qualifications in ac
tual practice. First there is the 
braking capability test, which con
firms the drivers ability to stop 
the buggy when needed; follow
ing this test is a vision test which 
certifies that the driver has the 
required ninety degree field of vi
sion.
After a buggy has survived all 
of these qualifying tests, but 
before it can be considered quali
fied to race during the Spring 
Carnival Sweepstakes runs, the 
buggy must first roll successfully 
five times through the length of 
the course. To be considered quali
fied, the driver must have com
pleted ten rolls on the course, and
he or she must successfully pass 
another buggy in the buggy that 
he or she will drive in the actual 
races.
The buggies passing these tests 
will be on exhibition on Thursday 
from 9 am to 3 pm in the Carnegie 
Mellon gym for the Buggy Design 
Competition, alongside vide
otaped presentations of past 
buggy races and Sun Racer, a 
solar powered vehicle.
The buggy races themselves 
take place on Friday, starting at 
8:30 am, with the mens and 
womens preliminary races, and 
Saturday, starting at 8 am, with 
the Alumni heats and the mens 
and womens finals. The mens 
finals take the top ten teams, 
while the womens final heats take 
the top six finishers.
Several talented bands 
slated to play Carnival
By AMANDA COHEN
Tartan Staffwriter
While Til Tuesday wont play 
until Sunday, you can listen to 
a number of other bands 
throughout carnival, with 
music ranging from reggae to 
classic trax.
On Thursday night, the NYC 
Swing Band will be in the Tent 
at 9 pm. An eight-piece group, 
the NYCSB play what has been 
described as hip-hop jazz, which 
should be worth seeing.
Five bands will be playing 
around the Midway on Friday, 
starting with the classic rock 
band Wattz in the Tent at 1 pm. 
At 2:30 pm, the Boilermaker 5,
a Dixieland band, will be in the 
Tent, replaced, at 6 pm, by more 
jazz, in the form of CMUs own 
The Heavy Cats. The night will 
be wrapped up by Foxx, a top 40 
cover band playing at Student 
Dormitory Councils Suitcase 
Dance in the Tent at 9 pm, and 
Deadly By Desire, who will be 
playing in Scotland Yard at 9 
pm and 11 pm.
Saturday, the music slows 
quite a bit. The Flow will be the 
only band in the Tent that day 
at 4:30 pm, and their reggae 
will be the last live music heard 
on the Midway until Til Tues
day does their bit on the Cut (or 
the Gym, if it rains) at 2pm 
Sunday.

Tartan Staffwriter
On the off chance that you get 
bored with the Midway booths 
and shows and even the Carnival 
rides after a while during Carni
val, Scotland Yard is the place for 
you to go.
Each night during Carnival 
Scotland Yard will feature a wide 
variety of talented performers in
cluding rock bands, comedians, 
folk singers, and top 40 bands.
On Thursday night, a cabaret 
of singers featuring Matt Ireland, 
Robin Garber, Esther Jeserum, 
Wayne Issac Worley, and Mike 
. will perform starting at 8 
pm and 10 pm.
Ireland is a sophomore at Car
negie Mellon University, though 
he is a freshman in the Design de
partment, and will perform his 
original folk material at 8 pm and
10 pm. Garber, an art major, will 
perform original songs with acous
tic guitar at 8:30 pm and 10:30 
pm. Jeserum, a double major in 
art and math, will perform some 
original and cover songs with 
acoustic guitar at 9 pm and 11 
pm. Rounding out the 
cabaret,Worley, an applied math 
major, and Shea, a music major, 
will be performing a variety of 
cover songs, including Billy Joel 
and Howard Jones songs, among 
others, with instruments ranging 
from acoustic guitar, mandolin, 
and upright bass at 9:30 pm and 
11:30 pm.
On Friday night, Scotland Yard 
will feature a comedian, John 
Rowan, at 8 pm, and the energetic
rock and roll band Bob Hop, whose
name is pronounced like the 
famous comedians, at 9 pm and
11 pm.
Deadly by Desire, a band mainly 
comprised of music students at 
ihis university, has also per
formed in several popular off-cam)us night spots, including 
3Rourkes Cafe in Squirrel Hill. 
Deadly by Desire will perform en:ertaining and original material 
in the Yard at 10 pm on Saturday 
night.
All of the performers are Car
negie Mellon University students, 
and most of the featured performstudents have played at Scotand Yard in the past.

Til Tuesday to bring Carnival 89 to a climactic finish
By DAWN BROSONSKI
Tartan Staffwriter
This year, even though 
Spring Carnival 89 festivities 
will officially end on Saturday 
evening, students will be 
treated to a performance 
Sunday afternoon featuring 
th popular group Til Tues
day.
This concert occurs right on 
the heels of the release of the 
groups third album, entitled 
Everything's Different Now. 
The title reflects approxi
mately two years of change 
and growth Til Tuesday has 
experienced. <
Im real thrilled about it, 
says Dave Levy, this years 
Spring Carnival Chairman. 
This is a chance for people to 
see a high caliber concert and 
it occurs at a time when we 
will likely get enough people 
to enjoy it.
 Til Tuesday plays good, re
laxed music with some upbeat 
numbers. The concert is per
fect for the Sunday after Car
nival, because people will have 
been partying the night before 
until 5 am, and this is a chance 
for calming down.
The groups two front-run
ning members are Aimee 
Mann (lead vocals, bass, gui
tars) and Michael Hausmann

The end of Carnival always seems 
like a letdown to me...This way, with 
a concert, it seems like a finale, al
most a definite ending to Carnival.  
B Carnival Chairman Dave Levy
things Different Now also fea
tured the playing of guitarist 
Robert Holmes, but he left the 
group sometime after the complepletion of the album to form his 
own band.
Joey Pesce, the bands original 
keyboardist, also left the group, 
but prior to the start of the re
cording sessions on Everythings 
Different Now. The new keyboar
dist is Michael Montes. Says 
Mann: He was perfect. I tend to 
write in a softer, slower mode, 
and Michael is able to give the 
songs a more rhythmic frame
work.
Mann formed Til Tuesday in 
1982 with Holmes, Pesce, and 
Hausmann. In 1984 the group 
won first place in WBCNs an
nual Rock And Roll Rumble, 
which lead to their signing a re
cording contract with Epic Rec
ords. With Epic, their debut 
album, Voices Carry, was released 
in February of 1986. The album
produced a Top Ten title single 
with Voices Carry. The album 
went gold with United States 
sales alone exceeding 500,000 cop
ies. Also in 1985, Til Tuesday re
ceived MTVs Best New Artist 
award.
Their second album, called Wel
come Homex was released in Sep
tember of 1986. It heralded the 
first collaboration between Til 
Tuesday and producer Rhett Da
vies, of Roxy Music/Bryan Ferry 
fame. For a second time, Davies 
acts as producer to the group on 
Til Tuesdays third album, Eve
rythings Different Now.
Epic describes the new album 
as follows: The first thing that 
will intrigue the listener is the 
rich sound of this record. It is not 
really a new or different sound: 
Its antecedents may be traced to 
mid-Sixties folk-rock and the 
diverse works of the modem 
singer/songwriters. But here, Til 
Tuesday combines the elements
of voice, melody, lyric, arrange
ment, and recording to build suc
cessive peaks of pop magic.
Some of the songs featured on 
Everythings Different Now in
clude the title track, written by 
Jules Shear with Matthew Sweet, 
Long Gone Buddy, Limits to 
Love, Why Must I, and Tele
scope, which was co-written by 
Mann and Elvis Costello, who also 
shares the lead vocal.
Its been four or five years since 
our first album, says Hausmann, 
the albums co-arranger/producer 
(and co-composer of How Can 
You Give Up and Long Gone 
Buddy), and neither of us has 
stopped listening to music or 
working on our technique. Were 
serious about this  we want to 
make great records. We refuse to 
put out stuff thats not up to a 
certain caliber.
As of this writing, Til Tuesday 
will perform at 2 pm on Sunday, 
April 16; the performance will 
most likely occur on the Cut, but, 
in deference to the Carnegie Mel
lon tradition of horrible Carnival 
weather, the gym is standing by 
in case of rain.
The end of Carnival always 
seems like a letdown to me, 
reminisces Levy. Midway 
abruptly shuts down, and some 
booths even close early. This way, 
with the concert, it seems like a 
finale, almost a definitive ending 
to Carnival.

Buggy driver describes freerolls
JBy BETH PETRICK
Special to the Tartan
Oh, God, its 4:30 am and the 
phone is ringing. Its Pete the 
buggy chair, I know it is. Its time 
$o get up. Should I answer the 
phone? I kind of have to, dont I ? 
^Couldnt I just pretend like Im 
!hot here? No, I guess I cant. Yes, 
Pete, Im getting ready. Ill see 
you in 15 minutes for the drop 
test.
; Oh geez, what do I have to wear? 
jjiow cold is it out there? How 
)nany layers of socks should I wear 
&o that I dont freeze my feet off? 
 Okay, so Im here at the top of 
frill 1 and Im semi-awake. Time 
lo get into the buggy. Put on the 
goggles, put on the harness, put 
on the gloves. Better be sure that 
the guys are holding the buggy 
Jgtill so I can get in alright.
" Im in the buggy. I feel like Im 
Sn a casket, but at least its warmer 
ip here than out there. Well, I 
have a few things to be thankful 
for. We have the biggest buggy 
but there, so I can wear as many 
lkyers of clothes as I want and I 
can wiggle my toes. I can also 
move my arms around so my 
shoulders dont get as stiff as other 
(Irivers. But I still get pretty stiff.
! Now its time for them to put me 
up on the sidewalk. This is fun. 
Please dont drop me, guys. 
Theyre taking me up to the white 
fine in front of the gym for the
drop test. As usual I pass. This 
test gets kind of boring after a 
while.
Its time for them to take me 
back in front of the library so that 
I can walk the course with my 
chairman. Its not like I havent 
done this four million times. Pete, 
I know what Im doing, thank 
you. The only thing Im concerned 
about is if theres any junk on the 
course.
So then I have to go back to the 
people with the green hats, other
wise known as the Sweepstakes 
chairmen. Hey, yes, we walked 
the course. Now Ive got to wait 
for rolls to start. Please, God, dont 
let it rain! Im up already; I might 
as well go through with it, even if 
Id rather be sleeping. There goes 
Pete trying to find out when rolls 
start. All right! We go in 10 min
utes.
So its time to get into the buggy 
again. Goggles, harness, all that 
crap.
Geez, I wonder who is around 
this buggy right now. I cant see 
anything but feet. Im getting to 
know everyones shoes pretty well. 
Hey, guys,whos pushing me now? 
Somebody talk to me, for Petes 
sake! Hmm, somebodys sticking 
his face in my windshield to keep 
me entertained until we roll.
I think I could actually get a 
good nap in here before we roll, if 
someone will wake me up before 
we start. I dont want to wake up
in mid roll.
All right, were third in the 
queue gettingready to roll. One of 
our pushers is jogging me out to 
hill 2. Were getting in the line up 
and Pete is sticking his face in my 
windshield. Hes telling me to 
remember my line pay and to roll 
as far as I can. Any questions?
Of course not.
Well Im going to get to roll. I 
can feel the adreneline flowing. 
This is pretty exciting. Our buggy 
doesnt go too fast, but its still 
exciting when your nose is 2 inches 
off the ground. Oh great, Phil just 
called an Air Force roll. Were 
going in.
Okay, guys, lets do it.
Jeff, the pusher on hill 2, starts 
running pretty fast, until I finally 
start going over the hill and he 
pushes me off.
Im going. Curve left. Okay, Im 
about to hit the first transition. 
Try to hit that corner of the curve. 
Lets see how close to the curb I 
can get. Okay, up to the second 
transition. I see the fire hydrant. 
As I cross over to the other side of 
the road past the left side of the 
monument, I really start picking 
up speed. All right, where is the 
chute flagger? Oh, there he is. 
Okay, Im getting closer. Its time 
to turn right into the chute. I 
wonder if its possible to spin out 
the ROTC buggy in the chute? I 
really doubt it.

Comedian Kenny to 
perform in the Tent
By AMANDA COHEN
Tartan Staffwriter
AB Coffeehouses contribu
tion to Carnival festivities will 
be a performance by comedian 
Tom Kenny, who will appear 
in the tent at 8 pm. on Satur
day night.
Kennys high-energy, highcomedy, high-power act will fit 
right into the laughingly fran
tic pace of Carnival. This show 
promises to be one of the humor 
highlights of the weekend, with 
a mixture of topical concepts 
and far-out stand-up.
But dont take our word for 
it. Take the word of Kennys 
old school chum, Bob Bobcat 
Goldthwait. Tom Tomcat 
Kenny opened for him on his 
tour and was also featured in 
Gbldth waits Cinemax Comedy 
Experiment, Dont Watch 
Tljis Show.
The former singers other 
credits include an appearance 
in the Twisted Sister video Be
Chrool to Your Scuel and a 
number of bookings on standup comedy TV shows including 
Comedy Tonight. Kenny also 
worked for a while in a threeman comedy show known as 
Uncle Stinkys Dipsy Doodle 
Revue.
By his own description, 
Kenny appears to be a cross 
between Buddy Holly and 
Woody Woodpecker. Believe 
it. Hes been described by vari
ous critics as dorky, frenetic, 
energetic, manic, mad-cap, 
zany, free-associative, relent
lessly lunatic, and possessed. 
If this isnt the spirit of Carni
val, nothing is.
Kenny is an internationally 
touring headliner of rapidly 
rising status. Hes performed 
at colleges fromthe University 
of Massachusetts to the Uni
versity of California, and now 
hes here. Keep an eye out for 
Kenny at Carnival and beyond, 
because hes headed for bigger 
things.

Tom Kenny will perform in the Tent on Saturday. His high-energy 
style has popularized him with the collegiate crowd.

Remember to keep a tight turn. 
Geez, how far am I going to roll 
today? Where is my pusher? Oh, 
there he is. All right; lets go. 
Start moving those legs!
So well go through this process 
a few more times before we can go 
home. I hope Petes in a good 
mood so that I can sit in his car 
between rolls. I wouldnt mind 
getting out of this cold, even for a 
little while. Only a couple more 
rolls. Gee, Im starting to get re
ally hungry all of a sudden. I just 
dont know about these buggy 
diets. Hope were going to Ritters 
after this. As if the whole push 
team wont try to stop me from 
eating. But, seriously, the guys 
are pretty good about it, since Im 
pushing too, and they dont want 
me to be sick on race day. Ah, they 
just called the end of rolls. Looks 
like well be at the beginning of 
the line up next time. Great!
Okay, time to get out of the 
buggy. Boy, I really wish that I 
could feel my toes. Its kind of 
hard.standing up when your feet 
are numb. The five layers of socks 
didnt really help much.But, all in 
all, it was all worth it, because 
driving, especially in a seethrough buggy like ours, is one of 
the best times you can have.
Now its time for me to get out of 
some of these layers so I can go to 
Ritters. Ten of us pile into a car 
and head to Shadyside to get a 
greasy breakfastexcept for me, 
of course. Coffee. I need coffee. 
Youve got to learn to like the 
stuff, especially when you have to 
get up at 4:30 am.
Here comes Sigma Nu and a 
couple of other buggy organiza
tions. The waitresses are freak
ing out because they cant handle 
all these people at once.
Okay, now its time to go home.

I could do something constructive 
like jog or start some homework, 
but I dont really feel up to it. So 
Ill take my three hour nap from

late tonight since you have to do 
the same thing tomorrow. Wish 
Id remembered that last night.

Remember all the fun you had 
at Airband?
So do we, so were trying to do it 
again. Spring Carnival '89 is still 
looking for airband-type acts for a 
lip-sync contest called SyncAlong. The contest is scheduled 
for 2 pm on Saturday afternoon in 
the Tent. The winning act will 
carry home fifty dollars in prize 
money.
To sign up for Sync-Along, call 
the AB office at x2105 and leave a 
message. Any solo, duo, band, 
group, supergroup, or megagroup 
is welcome, with or without props, 
instruments, costumes, or talent.
Everyone is welcome. All you 
need is a tape of your music and a 
body or two on the stage. And 
dont forget: fifty dollars for the 
best band. Did we mention that 
the best band wins fifty dollars? 
Well, in case we forgot, fifty buckaroos goes to the winning SyncAlong band.
In other Carnival entertain
ment news, be on the lookout for
strolling performers.
Magician Bill Averman will be 
wandering the fairgrounds on

A note from the Spring Carnival Chairperson.
It's been a long and winding road to "Toyland," but we're just about there. When I took on this job a little less that a year ago, I knew I 
was in for a few twists, but I never expected that it would turn out as well as it has.
The construction caused the losses of the traditional Midway and the fireworks display. The lack of space on campus has moved sec
tions of the Carnival to the Cut. We've moved the Midway and the Entertainment Tent and substituted a laser show; we've adapted to our 
new environment.
We've cut back on the number of rides to help return to the origins of Spring Carnival. Spring Carnival was originally the homecom
ing for Carnegie Tech and was separated from Homecoming as we know it in 1920. It's always been, and hopefully always will be, an enjoy
able time for all of Carnegie Mellon.
We've also modernized the Arts and Crafts fair. Besides craftspeople from campus, there will a fair amount from the Pittsburgh area. 
The fair will take place on the Cut: Friday and Saturday from noon until 6 pm.
There will also be a laser show in the Gym and from all reports it will 
be fantastic. Last but not least, Carnival will be capped off with a concert on 
the Cut on Sunday by 'Til Tuesday.
Sweepstakes, or "Buggy," has a special addition with the GM solar 
car Sunraycer being on display and possibly running the course on Friday.
In any case, take some time to look at the buggies during the design compe
tition on Thursday in the Gym.
I urge you to look through the next few pages and then go to the 
events. A lot of people have put in a lot effort and time to make this year's 
Spring Carnival, and we all hope you enjoy every minute.
From Sweepstakes to Midway I hope you'll agree that there's never a 
dull moment.
Finally, a personal thank you from me to all the organizations, the 
Spring Carnival Committee and the Sweepstakes committee. Without you 
there would not be a Spring Carnival.

5how is scheduled to open Thursday night
By MICHAEL T. ROSE
Vartan Diversions Editor
I Its Wednesday, one week bee Carnival. The frenzied final 
ash of work on booths and bug
les is evident in the tired eyes of 
Judents and the thin layer of 
iwdust coating the fraternity 
pad. The Activities Board and 
! Carnival Committee double 
their preparations and 
Infirm their arrangements. The 
Icitement and the anticipation 
 building rapidly all over cam|ln the midst of this commotion, 
.members of Scotch n Soda 
je. beginning to hit their collecgstride. Weeks of rehearsals, 
|j#es, and long hours are about 
off, and even the most 
fieEed-up buggy organization 
(buld have a tough time match[gthe enthusiasm of these dedii performers.
JThis Is Not A Test, S n Ss 
ring show, is premiering this 
lursday night in the Skibo Balljom. The play is based on a deIptively simple premise; as it

has a 70 percent chance of being 
obliterated by a meteor strike in 
24 hours. The play then deals 
with the ensuing consequences of 
this revelation, and the often hi
larious reactions that ordinary 
people display when confronted 
with extraordinary situations.
The group (and the show) is 
entirely student-run. Scotch n 
Soda is basically a student drama 
organization. We provide an op
portunity for students to have an 
outlet for their talents in the 
dramatic fields, says head writer/ 
performer Javier GrilloMarxuach. Students in the or
ganization are of almost all ma
jors, except drama. Drama stu
dents have not been writing or 
otherwise participating in the S 
n S productions since the mid
seventies.
S n S has been producing shows 
on the CMU campus for 81 years. 
This organization has been 
around a long time, says cast 
member/business manager Jim 
OConnell. I work in Alumni 
Relations, and [when alumni] ask 
me, What do you do? and I say 
Im in Scotch n Soda, and they 
go Oh,  and this is like class of

for one of their shows!1 
one of their shows!
One thing that S n S has a hard 
time shaking is the image of the 
student drama club. This is 
serious organization, says OCon
nell. Indeed, S n S is the only 
organization on campus that 
continually showcases student 
work. This Is Not A Test is a 
completely original production, 
with book, lyrics, and music writ
ten by students from square one, 
and that sort of massive project is 
something that even S n S hasnt 
done for a while. Last years spring 
show, Improv 88, was original as 
well, but didnt require the sort of 
coherent scripting that this years 
show does by virtue of the fact 
that it was an improvisational 
production and was written anew 
every night.
There is a certain weight of 
history on the upcoming show. As 
you might know, two of S n Ss 
original productions of the 60s  
Steven Schwartz Pippin and Godspell  have gone on to fame and 
Broadway. Does this past success 
overshadow the present achieve
ments of the organization?
Not really. Its a matter of

And the winner is...Joe Bob presents the 1988 Drive-In Oscars
Before presenting the winner 
jn the seventh annual Drive-In 
Academy Awards, perhaps it 
would behoove us to take a glance 
backward, a retrospective, as it 
were, back to the days of our 
meager beginnings when the 
Hubbie was only a gleam in the 
eye of a hooker on 42nd Street. Do 
you realize how few people at
tended?
; Actually, no one attended. But 
my point is that, today, in 1989, 
the Hubbie is a national treasure, 
honored each year in a nation
wide cable hookup. (Actually, 
theyre gonna stick it on The Movie 
Channel in the middle of the night, 
to try to fill up time between 
movies.) And I think it would be 
appropriate  nay, mandatory
 to review the principles and 
ideals of the DIAA, yay, the 
Hubbie:
1) We are dedicated to honoring 
the best in blood, in breasts, and 
in beasts.
2) The drive-in will never die.
3) Wed like to pick up the home 
phone numbers of some young 
impressionable actresses, if pos
sible.
4) If Tipper Gore wants to ban 
jt, it gets an automatic Hubbie.
5) Arnold Schwarzenegger is the 
only person to ever actually ac
cept his Hubbie, so he has been 
retired from active competition 
(after winning Best Actor four 
straight years).
6) The Joe Bob Briggs Lifetime 
Achievement Award, engraved on 
a 1967 Chevy hubcap, has been
; awarded to only two people: Roger 
[ Corman, producer of more than 
\ 300 drive-in movies; and Stephen 
King, the acknowledged King of 
the Drive-In.
7) Anybody can vote for the 
Hubbies, even people who are 
dumber than dirt.
8) The drive-in will never die.
May I have the first category,
please?

Awards in Grapevine, Texas. 
Kinda makes you wonder, dont 
it?
Joe Bob says check it out.
Jennifer Rubin maintains a stiff upper lip in the face of the news tft 
shes won the Best Actress Hubbie for 1988.S n S plays Ballroom
continued from page L14
putting on quality productions 
and not getting stagnant, accord
ing to performer (and S n S board 
member) Nancy Gleason. There 
have been shows in the past that 
have been successful, but we cant 
do Pippin every year, we cant do 
an improv show every year, we 
cant do Godspell every year.. .and 
we cant do This Is Not A Test next 
year...To me, its doing quality 
work without doing the same 
thing all the time.
This year, S n S has also pro
duced a number of short plays, 
among them a sci-fi kung fu soapopera three-parter calledLes Mis
informed that was performed in 
Scotland Yard and was extremely 
successful. During the fall, the 
organization holds writing and 
performance workshops and 
makes some preparations for the 
spring show. The spring, accord
ing to director Tamar Copeland, 
is more hellish, but in recent 
years the fall projects have ad
vanced in sophistication and 
emphasis. The fall projects also 
provide diversity by allowing more 
performers and writers to pres
ent their work. When youre 
providing more than one thing, 
says Grillo-Marxuach, people 
will get hooked on it, because its 
always going to be something 
different.
The current production had its 
genesis in the writing workshops 
of the fall semester. It is com
posed of a number of short pieces 
that deal with the theme of immi
nent Armageddon from differing 
perspectives. One of the key points 
of the show is that there is only a 
70 percent chance of destruction; 
there is still a 30 percent chance 
that the meteor will miss the 
Earth entirely. Its like Wheel of 
Fortune, and seven out of the ten 
spaces say Bankrupt, says cast 
member Todd VanderHeyden.
Believe it or not, its a very funn 
show, says Copeland. I thin 
the fact that were doing a mus 
cal about the end of the worl 
says something about the kind 
upbeat gang of rogues we are 
says Grillo-Marxuach.
Doing a show about the end 
the world can sometimes be 
little bit depressing. Forthemos 
part, its really made me think, 
says cast member Elizabeth Cron 
ise. Theres one specific mono 
logue in the show that made 
cry the first time I saw it pei 
formed... It made me really thin 
about, W'hat would I be doing?1,': 
It really makes you think abon 
your priorities, and whether 
not youre living every second t 
the fullest. According to Grille 
Marxuach, Werehopingthatth 
audience will walk out of the sho? 
wondering where theyre at, 
if it was all going to be taken awa 
from them the next day, and 
less than twelve hours, whatth'6 
would do to remedy it, or live wit 
it... The end of the world isnt'9i 
point of the show, its a device.
The cast and crew of This IsNi 
A Test are clearly dedicated 
their show. Musical directo 
Jessie Ramey says, Id like peop 
to know that there is an increi 
ible amount of talent at CM 
thats not currently being en 
ployed by Fine Arts theatre-A 
partment, and that Scotch n Sod 
exists for that talent, and that tv 
are definitely showcasing it thi 
year with our spring show. Ca 
member Jodi Smith says, Th 
isnt just an organization, its 
theatre company, and people don 
realize that.
This Is Not A Test opens to th 
public on Thursday, April 13 at

Finally, PBS for the rest of us
|jjy DRUE MILLER
I fartan Copy Manager 
I & MICHAEL SCHWARTZ 
Tartan Staffwriter
I Tired of watching all those 
Sesame Street reruns? Looking 
I (or something closer to your style? 
ijttsburghs WQEX (channel 16) 
\fill challenge your conception of 
public television.
PBS has been a network for the 
young and old, but until recently 
Ijt lacked shows targeted specifiI tally toward todays young adults. 
IyideoSpin, an exciting new proIgram hosted by Thom Downing of 
EX and Scott Paulsen of 
-PM, may put an end to 
lyour search for the perfect PBS 
alternative. ,
Aimed at a 18-35 year-old 
audience, VideoSpin is a weekly 
half-hour show featuring the 
Ivideos of non-mainstream perlformers. Often, new artists are 
peen on VideoSpin even before 
Itheir music hits the charts. One 
Isuch case is the video for What I 
I Am by Edie Brickell & New 
[Bohemians, which was seen on 
I VideoSpin before MTV and BillIboard caught up. Dont Lets 
Istart from They Mightbe Giants, 
Wild World from Maxi Priest, 
|the controversial This Notes for 
You from Neil Young, Bobby 
HcFerrins Good Lovin, and 
Muno from ThrowingMuses also 
appeared on VideoSpin long be
fore MTV began airing them.
VideoSpin is interested in pre
senting to the public new and 
innovative sounds as well as inter
esting visual artistry. As co-host 
Downing says, VideoSpin is pro
gressive, not dangerous. Why do 
something thats been done? ItB 
our job to show videos the audi
ence cant get anywhere else.
Apparently, the rest of the coun
try agrees with Downing. Last 
week, VideoSpin went national, 
appearing on dozens of PBS affili
ates around the country. QEX 
Station Manager Ken Tiven 
pitched the show to other stations 
earlier this year and picked up 
the 25 required to get the show on 
the satellite feed. Since then, the 
number has jumped to 60 carri
ers, including stations in Boston, 
Atlanta, New York City, San 
Bemadino, and both the east- and 
west-coast Portlands. Several of 
these stations are affiliated with 
or operated by colleges, and 
Downing sees in this a natural 
link to the college radio stations 
that play the music featured on 
VideoSpin.
Many PBS fans are counting on 
VideoSpin to attract young, hip 
devotees, and in doing so, help 
alleviate PBSs sedate, often 
stodgy image. As Downing puts 
it, Not a lot of programs bridge 
the gap between Mr. Rogers and 
McNeil-Lehrer. Witty dialogue 
between the co-hosts is a corner
stone of the show; Downing and 
Paulsen comment on videos,
songs, artists and whatever else 
pops into their minds with reck
less abandon. Although each epi
sode is scripted, theres ample 
room for ad-libbing, and its this 
type of candor that makes the 
show so enjoyable. PBSblissfully 
obvious absence of commercials 
is also a boon, not just to viewers 
but also producers, in that theyre 
given more leeway in deciding 
what their audience wants to see 
and neednt worry about offend
ing sponsors tastes. That kind of 
freedom is paramount in doing 
the show, says a very apprecia
tive Downing.
Videos arent all thats seen in 
the show. VideoSpin also offers a 
variety of feature segments: 
World Spin" focuses on the top 
releases from a particular coun
try; X-Coun try Traxfeaturesthe 
top releases from radio stations 
across the U.S.A; Whos In/ 
Whats Out gives all the latest 
news about recent albums and 
tour information; Rockonomics 
focuses on the economic side of 
the music business; and Pop 
Quiz challenges the viewers with 
music trivia.
If you want Madonna, George 
Michael and Whitney Houston, 
tune in to MTV. But if its fresh 
new artists and original new 
sounds youre after, this is the 
show youve been waiting for.
VideoSpin is seen weekly on 
WQEX, Sunday nights at 6:30pm 
and Wednesday nights at 8 pm.
Hedda Gabler comes to Public
Pepsi drops the Material Girls ads
By DAN BIDWA
I Tartan Staffwriter
..Pepsi has dropped their Mafdonna ad campaign. Seems that 
Ihe^good Reverend Wildmons 
|llo\yers werent happy with the 
[video for Madonnas Like a 
?rayer. The song is used in the 
[Pepsi commercial; the video isnt 
used in the ad, but the regular 
[yideo shows Madonna with stig
mata, and later dancing in front 
f a bunch of burning crosses, 
(eally, the video makes very little 
|ense, and seems like an attempt 
la>hide the fact that the song 
lucks to begin with.) Anyway, 
letters were written, the high 
puckamucks at Pepsi got nervhcD and bang, no more Madonna 
bmmercials. Now, ordinarily this 
wouldnt bother me  less Ma
donna is good Madonnabut the 
$ame sort of thing just happened 
with the sitcom Married, With 
[Children, and the whole thing 
pakes me nervous. Wildmon has 
Jone this sort of thing before - he 
pent after Ralph Bakshis Saturiay morning Mighty Mouse car
ton a while ago (something about
susic gniMl gniMl
oBfMB6
some scene that supposedly 
showed Mighty Mouse snorting 
cocaine). Pepsis case of the nerves 
probably wont hurt Madonnas 
image, but I wont be drinking too 
much Pepsi from here on out.
Despite what the Mattress 
Factory has to say about it, the 
Sonic Temple is still open. Maybe 
the Wilkinsburg police are less 
touchy than the cops on the strip. 
Anyway, the Temple broke even 
for the first month. Stop by and 
help them out by checking out a 
show sometime. Call the Temple 
at 244-8447 for upcoming shows.
All of you XXP zombies can rest 
easy now, because its coming 
back, sort of. WXVX is the new 
name (WXXV is already occupied), 
and its going to be somewhere 
around 1500 on your AM dial. 
Yes, your AM dial. Itll be about 
500 watts in stereo (youll have to
have a stereo AM re
ceiver to get it that way, 
though), and should be 
on the airwaves some
time in the next couple 
of weeks. Maybe theyll 
actually play some new 
music this time.
Charges are being brought 
against the officer who was vide
otaped while punching a Grateful 
Dead fan in the face. (The fan was 
being escorted to a paddy wagon. 
Both of his arms were being held 
by cops.) Of course, the hearing 
will be in front of (wait for it) cops, 
so dont expect much, especially 
since the chief of police has made 
it known that he considers the 
actions taken by police to be 
completely justifiable. Some of the 
people there who got maced might 
have something else to say about 
that.
If you get sick of the entire 
Carnival nonsense, go see Bullet 
LaVolta at the Sonic Temple Fri
day night. Real punk rock. Theyll 
be appearing along with the 
Lemonheads and Half Life. Itll 
be better than anything youll see 
on campus that night. Really.
Petitions Due Today 
at Skibo Info Desk 
for 
Senate, Treasurer, 
and Presidential 
Candidates
By ROBERT CUCUZZA
Tartan Senior Prod. Asst.
A new adaption of Henrik 
Ibsens world class drama 
Hedda Gabier opens at the 
Pittsburgh Public Theatre on 
April 11. The production will 
feature Pittsburgh actors He
lena Ruoti and Jim Abele in the 
lead roles.
The play, about a womans 
destructive search for self-sat
isfaction, has been newly 
adapted by Obie Award win
ning playwright Corrinne 
Jackar. Jackar has written for 
television and film and cur
rently is a Professor in Film 
Studies at Columbia Univer
sity.
I commissioned this adap
tion specifically for Helena 
Ruoti, said Producing Direc
tor Bill Gardner. It is meticu
lously true to Ibsens original 
but rendered in language that 
is free of out-dated colloquial
isms.
The production is directed by 
Lee Sankowich. Sankowich has 
directed numerous successful
dramas at the Public including 
Edith Stein, The Real Thing, and 
Serenading Louie, as well as 
owning and operating the Zephyr 
Theater in Los Angeles. 
Sankowich has taught directing 
and acting in the Carnegie Mel
lon Drama Department.
The cast includes some of Pitts
burghs most successful perform
ers. Ruoti, recognized as Pitts
burghs finest actress by the local 
press, will play Hedda Gabler, an 
enigmatic and controversial role 
which has consistently fascinated 
the theatre world. Ruoti has 
appeared in three Public produc
tions, including the record 
breaking Edith Stein, where she 
played the title role.
Also appearing will be Abele in 
the role of Eilert Lovborg. Abele 
has three Public shows to his 
credit: TheHairyApe,EdithStein, 
and The Normal Heart. He re
cently appeared in a new adapta
tion of The Three Musketeers at 
the Indiana Repertory Theatre as 
well as numerous regional and 
New York productions.
Also featured are Michael Hume 
as George Tesman, Will Rhys as
Judge Brack and Catherine 
Butterfield asTheaElvsted.All 
have recently performed at the 
Public in various productions.
In cooperation with the CMU 
Drama department, the Public 
will also present an Ibsen 
symposium on Saturday, April 
22, and Sunday, April 23. The 
symposium will be held in 
Margaret Morrison Carnegie 
Hall and will feature noted 
Ibsen scholars Brian Johnston,

Hiroshima, Mon Amour
This movie will not get you in the mood for Carni
val. Its a love story, but a confused one, full of angst 
and guilt. Married French actress falls for married 
A-b'omb survivor, but the convoluted story never is 
truly believable.The movie itself is a technical 
masterpiece, one of the best French New Wave films 
(e.g. Breathless (1959)) and is innovative in its 
narration.

The Great Outdoors
Why do so many talented comedians like John 
Candy and Dan Aykroyd make such bad movies? No 
answers here, but another good example of this 
syndrome on Friday. Candy and Aykroyd take the 
wilderness for fun and frolic. The midway will be 
open, and Deadly By Desire is at Scotland Yard, so 
go there instead.

Red Heat
If it wasnt Carnival, you wouldnt be able to get a 
seat for this one. Arnie is back, and this time his 
accent fits his character. In yet another mismatched 
cop movie, Schwarzzeneger is a Russian cop teamed 
with Jim Belushi, one of Chicagos finest. No sur
prises here, some laughs, some violence. If youre 
still sober, go see it.

American Graffiti
The 70s had some good films. The 70s had some 
great films. American Graffiti is one one of the 
latter. The names should be easy to recognize: 
Francis Ford Coppolla, George Lucas, Ron Howard, 
Cindy Howard, Richard Dreyfuss, Harrison Ford, 
Mackenzie Phillips and quite a few more. We didnt 
live through 1962, but watching this movie will 
bring it home. If youre alive after Carnival, dont 
miss it.

Although it probably wont 
make my own top ten list of 
musical events for the 88-89 sea
son, I hope readers will consider 
attending the most important 
event of my personal music year, 
that is, my senior piano recital on 
Sunday, April 16 at 8 pm in 
Alumni Concert Hall, CFA. The 
program consists entirely of 
French music and assisting will 
be Raul Sanchez, violin, Nicole 
Brockmann, viola, and Jeffrey 
Schoyen, cello. Anyone wishing 
to be the critic for the concert is 
welcome to talk to my editor, as I 
might be a little biased in my 
coverage.
Other recitals in the Music 
Department include that of my 
friend and colleague, David 
Bruno, whose senior piano recital 
takes place Saturday, April 15 at 
8 pm, also in Alumni Concert Hall.
Among faculty events is a duo 
recital by Linda George Fountain, 
oboe, and Byron McCulloh, trom
bone, Monday, April 17 at 8 pm in 
Mellon Institute. If Carnival fails 
to capture all your attention (and 
energy) this coming weekend, all 
these events are free and open to 
the public.
Elsewhere in Pittsburgh, the 
only big event is with the Pitts
burgh Symphony, whose subscrip

Tartan Staffwriter
Its finally here. The week that 
all of you have been waiting for 
ever since that first day of school, 
way back in August, has arrived. 
Sure, its Carnival week, but more 
importantly this week is also the 
first anniversary of the return of 
The Rocky Horror Picture Show 
to the Kings Court theater. Not 
only is this film probably the best 
movie musical ever made, but it 
stars one of my favorite actors in 
the cinema today, Tim Curry. So 
in keeping with the celebration I 
am dedicating this weeks column 
to two of his best movies, Clue and 
Legend.
Sure, a lot of movies out there 
are based on plays, books, songs, 
comic strips, even sex manuals, 
but Clue is to my knowledge the 
only movie based on a board game.
The movie is based very closely 
on the game. All of the characters 
from the game, each of the exotic 
murder weapons, and all the 
various rooms exist in this movie. 
In fact, there are even three dif
ferent endings to the movie, each 
having a different murderer, 
murder weapon and motive. To 
top it all off this movie has an 
incredible cast: Madeline Kahn 
as Mrs. White, Martin Mull as 
Colonel Mustard, Christopher 
Lloyd as Professor Plum, Michael 
McKean as Mr. Green, and last 
but not least Tim Curry as the 
English butler.
The story is relatively simple. 
All six characters have been called 
together one stormy evening to 
an English country house in the 
middle of nowhere for some un
known reason. Eventually the 
reason they were all called to
gether is revealed.
A sinister man named Mr. 
Boddy, whom everyone seems to 
know, brings them into his study 
and gives each of them a gift. And 
what gifts: a lead pipe, a candle
stick, a gun, a knife, a rope, and a 
wrench. Mr. Boddy then suggests 
that they kill the butler, who has 
the only key out of the house, then
PSO presents eclectic program...Italian music featured
leave quietly and forget that this 
evening ever happened. The next 
thing you know, the lights go off, 
you hear a scream, hear a gun 
shot, and Mr. Boddy is dead.
Now someone in that room 
killed Mr. Boddy, but no one is 
telling who. The rest of the movie 
centers around them trying to find 
out who the murderer is. During 
the course of the investigation, 
people are droppinglike flies. Only 
by the end of the movie does this 
mess get sorted out, and in three 
different ways. Take the way you 
like best.
This movie is incredibly funny. 
The entire cast does an excellent 
job, but Curry is break-downlaughing funny. Hes just as crazy 
and wild as the butler in Clue as 
he was playing Dr. Frank-NFurter in Rocky Horror. Of all the 
endings the first two are very 
good and funny, but the last one 
(and the original one) is by far the 
best of the three. If you liked the 
game, or if you just like good 
comedy, then youll love Clue.
Legend is a good movie but has 
a problem that a lot of movies run 
into. It has a good cast, some su
perb acting, incredible special 
effects, but a really weak story;
Legend is about a time when an 
evil prince named Darkness (Tim 
Curry) lives in caverns far be
neath the earth, scheming to de
stroy all the goodness in the world, 
blot out the sun, and rule a land of 
gloom forever. To do this all he 
has to do is kill off two unicorns 
which magically hold all the good
ness of the earth. However, Dark
ness, as his name implies, can not 
go out into the sun or else he will
die vampire 
style. So he gets 
his little grubby 
henchmen to do 
the job.
In this world 
of light and hap
piness there ex
ist Jack (Tom 
Cruise) and Lili 
(Mia Sara). Jack 
is a hero whose 
mission in life is 
to destroy Darkness. Lili is the 
young woman he falls in love with, 
but she gets captured by Dark
ness minions and thereby Jack is 
forced to enter the catacombs 
below. Will Jack save Lili? Will 
Jack rescue the unicorns? Can 
Jack destroy Darkness forever?
Hey, are Os fries greasy?
After hearing a story line 1ft 
that, you want Darkness to win. 
would pay anything to see Ton 
Cruise get it right between 
eyes. You dont get to see that 
however. What you do get to do 
see the overwhelming sets, watcl 
the impressive special effects 
hear the incredible soundtrack 
and get blown away by the bril 
liant performance from Curry 
Seeing him with his blazing eyes 
and gigantic horns, he is truly ai 
incredible sight. Rent this movii 
and watch the pretty sights, bu 
look out for that plot.

Gallery hosts seniors
By JULIETTE BORDA
Special to The Tartan
Beginning tomorrow at the 
Forbes Gallery will be a show of 
work by senior art majors Kath
leen Summers and Mina Park. 
Summers will show ceramic sculp
tures, while Park will exhibit some 
of the products of her major in 
painting.
Park recalls a quote by Robert 
Motherwell which expresses her 
attitude toward abstraction: In 
abstract painting, the goal to 
reach is the shock of recognition. 
Paraphrased, this means that an 
artist may use tubes and tubes of 
paint, but the piece is not com
plete until the painting suddenly 
looks like it is unmistakably 
the artists own. According to 
Motherwell and Park, this sense 
of completion is not gradual; 
rather, it comes as a revelation.
Park feels content with her 
switch from realism to abstrac
tion, claiming that abstraction is 
more personal to her. Through 
form and color (lots of bright ones), 
Park strives to make a feeling 
look right. Scattering her stu
dio walls are 4 by 6 inch studies 
(mini paintings) for idea genera
tion, although only the 4 foot by ( 
foot finished painting shows thi 
labor of layered paint. The smal 
studies are much more immedi 
ate.
Whereas Park uses large paint 
ings and vivid color to express he 
feelings, Summers chooses to us 
an added dimension (the thin 
one, that is). Hand-crafted in clay 
her sculptures resemble animals 
but speak of something deeperthe ecological connection betweei 
man and animal. Contrary t< 
popular belief, Summers explain, 
man is not sacred. Just as othe 
animal species die out, so will w 
someday.
Some of Summerss pieces ar 
very realistic-lookinglife-size 
turtles with rich, bumpy texture 
and glazes that resemble actus 
turtle skin, for example  yi 
others are on a smaller scale, 
are fantastical in nature. He 
Animal/Man series include 
sculptures of beings that are ha 
pig-half man, and half reindee 
half man.
Theres something for everyoi 
this week at Forbes Gallery. Don 
miss the closing reception Frida 
night from 7-9 pm. Call the Forbi 
Gallery for details at X2081.
ian composers. Allesandro Siciliani, 
who makes his lo
cal debut with these 
concerts, conducts 
the Pittsburgh 
Symphony pre
miere of the Rossini 
Stabat mater. The Mendelssohn 
Choir, Robert Page director, and 
four vocal soloists, also in their 
PSO debuts, join Siciliani for the 
concert. They include Elizabeth 
Holleque, soprano (who will also 
appear in next months Pittsburgh 
Opera production of Tosca), Alice 
Baker, mezzo-soprano, Stanford 
Olson, tenor (1986 Met auditions 
winner), and Kevin Short, bassbaritone. In addition to the 
Rossini, the orchestra will open 
the program with two works by 
Ottorino Respighi, Gli Uccelli 
(The Birds) for small orchestra, 
and Fontane di Roma (The Foun
tains of Rome) for a larger en
semble. Less famous than The 
Pines of Rome, these two pieces 
have not been heard on PSO pro
grams since 1974 and 1966, re
spectively.
In conjunction with the all-Italian program this weekend, the 
PSO is offering, before and dur
ing intermission on the Thursday 
and Friday concerts, special wine 
tastings, cappuccino, and cannoli.
On Sunday, an Italian brunch 
will be served before the concert 
beginning at 12:30 pm. For more 
information and reservations for 
these special events call 392-4897. 
Concerts this weekend are Thurs
day at 8 pm, Friday at 8:30 pm
