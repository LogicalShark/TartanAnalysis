p\IFC Report Recommends ATO Probation< Endowment 
Suffers Major 
Setback
By JOSH RUBEN
Tartan Staffwriter
Carnegie Mellons endowment fund 
 suffered a severe setback as a result of 
the recent stock market woes. Accord
ing to Vice President of Business Af
fairs, Fred Rogers, Carnegie Mellon 
lost nearly $20 million.
As of June 30, the schools total en
dowment was over $265 million. The 
endowment is composed of funds re
ceived from alumni, foundations, and 
gifts from private individuals or compa
nies for use by the university (in fiscal 
year 1986-87, 35 percent of living 
alumni contributed to the school).
Rogers pointed out that not all of 
these funds are invested on the stock 
market.
Certain funds are restricted and are 
not subject to the universitys discrem tionary use. Other funds are designated 
as unrestricted and are invested to in
crease their worth.
Early this year, as the stock market 
was on a steady rise, the endowment 
benefited and grew. Then, when the 
market almost collapsed, in what Wall 
Street investors are calling, Black 
Monday, Camegie Mellon suffered, 
just like every other investor around the 
country. The Dow Jones Average 
dropped 508 points.
According to Rogers, the 
endowments value fell to around 245 
million dollars. The loss was so severe 
because the market was up prior to 
Black Monday, and so the value of 
the endowment was higher.
The actual investing is not handled by 
anyone at the university. Investment 
managers selected by the board of trus
tees do the actual trading and investing.
As to whether or not he or anyone 
knows how much and of what stocks are 
owned by the school, Rogers said that 
we are not sure on any given day what 
our investments are.

On Tuesday, October 27, the Interfratemity 
Investigative Committee submitted a report to 
the Interfratemity Council (IFC) concerning 
the actions of Alpha Tau Omega during the 
fraternity pledge night this fall. The report 
included recommendations of possible social 
probation for ATO and the establishment of 
concrete pledge night policies.
The Chief Court Justice for the IFC, Todd 
Tomczyk (a Delta Upsilon brother), was chair
man of the committee that drafted the report. 
He explained how the report itself has little 
value until the IFC as a whole votes on the 
issue. What we [the committee members] did 
was investigate the facts. We tried to investi
gate whether or not ATO as a house should be 
held responsible for the individual incidents 
that occurred that night. The individuals in
volved are pursuing independent settlements.
Since the guys who got hurt know exactly who 
hurt them, they can press [personal] charges 
against them, whether it be in the IFC or crimir 
nal court. The report, however, deals with 
ATOs activities during the entire night, and 
the recommendations in it were based on the 
overall situation. What we have to do now is sit 
down and review the report, since it was writ
ten to inform the IFC members and those 
involved so they could prepare defenses when 
the issue is voted on at the next IFC meeting 
[Tuesday, November 10].
Theta Xi brother Phil Antonson was a 
member of the investigative committee and 
agreed that ATO should not be held respon
sible for individual actions. When I was 
asked to be on the committee, explained 
Antonson, I was assigned to investigate the 
ATO - DU incidents involving other houses 
[specifically Kappa Sigma], as well as the 
fight itself. When we [the committee] got
together, we found that we pretty much agreed 
on the facts concerning what actually hap
pened, and that no disciplinary action against 
ATO should be taken, as far as the individual 
incidents themselves go. One source told me 
how some of the DU brothers kept on pushing 
their way onto the ATO porch after being told 
not to come up. You really cant justify some
one getting punched in the face, but it was 
obvious to me that there was provocation on 
both sides concerned. The ultimate decision 
of the committee reflected the opinion that the 
individuals themselves should take responsi
bility for their own actions, and that ATO as a 
house was responsible only as far as the lack of 
communication and control were concerned.
Tomczyk declined to comment on the com
mittee recommendation for social probation, 
feeling that any such comments would be 
premature considering the tentativeness of the

Pressler, Druffel Debate Over SEI
By CHRIS YOUNG
Tartan Staffwriter 
In an open stand-off Thursday afternoon, 
Larry Druffel, the director of the Software 
Engineering Institute, and Jonathan Pressler, 
>a Camegie Mellon Philosophy professor, 
engaged in a public debate over the ethically 
controversial issues involved in SEIs rela
tionship with the Department of Defense. The 
debate, sponsored by the ECE Forum (Elec
trical and Computer Engineering) in Gregg 
Hall, gave CMU students, faculty, and staff 
an opportunity to witness first-hand the argu
ments for and against SEIs software engic^neering program, a program funded largely 
by the DoD and designed mainly to satisfy the 
software engineering needs of American 
military technology.
The debate started off with Jonathan 
Pressler giving his own description of the 
SEI, and then he detailed several arguments
against the the purpose of the SEI and the way 
in which it is run. As Pressler phrases it, Car
negie Mellon signed a contract with the DoD in 
1984 making it the manager of the Software
Engineering Institute. Its important to remem
ber that the SEI is a DoD facility. SEIs mis
sion is to provide rapid improvement of the 
quality of operational software in mission-criti
cal computer resource systems. What are mis
sion-critical computer resource systems? 
They are software and hardware systems es
sential to the operation of equipment involved
in fighting wars, says Pressler. An example 
would be military aircraft, current tanks, 
guided missiles, navy ships, etc. As the con
tract says, The SEI will be tasked to satisfy
the software technology needs of the DoD. 
The ultimate decisions about the SEIs workprogram are made by the joint Department of 
Defense Advisory Committee, which is in
deed a committee within the DoD.
Im going to present ethical arguments in 
spite of the fact that Angel Jordan said there 
are no ethical issues related to SEI. declared 
Pressler. Its apparent that the United States 
knowingly gives and sells military weapons to 
support governments and groups that use them 
to suppress democracy, exploit workers, de
stroy peoples' homes, paralyze innocent civil
ians, and murder children. SEI might well be 
involved in things we certainly wouldn't ap
prove of.
Two of Pressler's arguments against the SEI 
are as follows: A)One has a certain responsi
bility to determine whether the products one 
manufactures for an agent are intended to be
continued on page 7
...anyone working for the SEI knows that many of their prod
ucts will be eventually used in crimes against humanity...
Jonathan Pressler
I say that if we can build software technology that can make 
American lives safer the next time, then Im all for it.

Gorbachev Will Visit 
U.S. in December
WASHINGTON (DJ)  President Reagan, 
in announcing that Soviet leader Mikhail 
Gorbachev will visit Washington beginning 
Dec. 7 for a summit likely to result in the 
signing of an intermediate range nuclear arms 
treaty, said that progress is possible on 
bridging differences between the U.S. and the 
Soviet Union over Reagans plan for a strate
gic defense system, called SDI.
But Reagan also said he has made it clear to 
the Soviets that there is no way we can give up 
SDI.
The President also said talks would continue 
on reducing stockpiles of longer range weap
ons, and said he hopes to be able to sign such 
an accord in a return visit to Moscow next year.
Reagan made the announcement in the 
White House briefing room after meeting with 
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevard
nadze.
Shevardnadze held meetings earlier in Octo
ber with Secretary of State George P. Shultz, 
and both sides said afterward they had nearly 
finished work on the treaty.
But at the close of the talks, Gorbachev 
surprised his guests by saying he was not yet 
prepared to travel to the U.S. for a summit.
But last Tuesday, in Moscow, U.S. Ambas
sador Jack Matlock was called in by Shevard
nadze, who told him he wanted to fly to Wash
ington for talks at the end of the week.
Iranian Missile Kills 
Baghdad Civilians
BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP)  The military said 
an Iranian missile slammed into a residential 
area of the city early Friday, killing an un
specified number of civilians. Iran said the 
missile was aimed at Iraqs air force com
mand.
An Iraqi military spokesman said a number 
of citizens were martyred and another number 
wounded when the missile supplied to the 
criminal Iranian regime by the enemies of the 
Arab nation hit Baghdad.
Correction:
Last week's Tartan incorrectly reported 
the Student Senate vote on their free 
speech resolution as 12-4. The actual 
vote was 14-12.
The spokesman, who was not identified, also 
said the missile demolished a number of civil
ian residences and damaged others. The state
ment was carried by state-run Baghdad radio, 
monitored in Cyprus.
Iraq will not let these crimes pass without a 
severe punishment at the appropriate time, 
said the spokesman. He did not elaborate.
Irans official Islamic Republic News 
Agency, also monitored in Cyprus, reported 
the surface-to-surface missile was fired at 1:07 
am at a building housing the air force com
mand in central Baghdad.
The report did not say where the missile was 
fired from, but the nearest Iranian border is 78 
miles east of Baghdad.
Two Americans Shot 
Dead In Philippines
MANILA (AP)  A U.S. serviceman and a 
retired American air force officer were shot 
dead Wednesday in attacks near the giant 
U.S.-run Clark Air Base, the military reported.
Maj. Gen. Donald Snyder, 13th Air Force 
commander, said a Filipino was also slain in 
one of four shooting incidents near the base, 
and the car of an American was fired on. He 
said the driver was not wounded.
Snyder, appearing on the military Far East 
Network, said the identities of the assailants 
were not known. He said he ordered strict 
security around the base, 50 miles north of 
Manila.
More than 26,000 U.S. troops, Defense 
Department civilians and dependents are sta
tioned at the base, located in Angeles City. 
Communist rebels operate in the area but in the 
past have generally refrained from targeting 
Americans.
However, the rebels have issued warnings 
recently that they would target Americans if 
the United States became deeply involved in 
counterinsurgency operations.
Soon after the announcement, the U.S. Navy 
restricted travel between Clark and the Subic 
Bay naval station 50 miles to the west.
Reagan Names New 
High Court Nominee
WASHINGTON (DJ)  Douglas Ginsburg, 
a federal appeals court judge here, who was 
nominated for a seat on the Supreme Court by 
President Reagan, is a former Harvard Law 
School professor and has served in the Reagan 
administration as Chief of the Justice 
Departments antitrust division and as an

administrator of the Office of Management 
and Budget. He is an advocate of increased 
economic analysis in law to measure a variety 
of issues in cost benefit terms.
Reagan made the announcement in the East 
Room of the White House before a large audi
ence of administration officials and GOP 
congressional leaders signaling that he intends 
to take a high profile in pressing for 
Ginsburgs confirmation.
Its time for the Senate to show it will join 
with me to protect the independence of the 
judiciary, Reagan said in an apparent refer
ence to the campaign that defeated Bork.
Reagan praised Ginsburg as a highly re
garded member of the legal profession and a 
believer in judicial restraint.
Miami Investor Shoots 
Broker; Kills Self
MIAMI (UPI)  An old customer who 
apparently lost heavily in the stock market 
crash and opened fire in a Merrill Lynch office 
near here, killing one vice president and 
wounding another before turning the gun on 
himself, was identified as Arthur Kane, 53, of 
Kendall, police spokesman Alfredo HidalgoGato said.
In New York, Merrill Lynch Chairman Wil
liam A. Schreyer and President Daniel Tully 
said, We are deeply shocked and saddened to 
learn of this incident, and we extend our heart 
felt sympathies to all the families affected by 
this event.
Jose Argilagos, who was fatally shot, joined 
Merrill Lynch in 1961, and was named man
ager of the Falls office in 1977. He became a 
vice president in 1976.
Lloyd Kolokoff, the injured man, was hired 
in 1975 and became a Merrill Lynch vice 
president in 1986.
Jerry Bovenkamp, property manager for the 
Merrill Lynch building, said It appears that a 
man called up in the morning and asked for a 
meeting with his broker and the manager, 
Bovenkamp said. My security people tell me 
the man went into the managers office and 
then the shooting started.
The Merrill Lynch office is in a separate 
building at the Falls, a trendy shopping center 
about 12 miles southwest of Miami, well away 
from the main shopping area.
Senate Votes to Ban 
Smoking on Planes
WASHINGTON  The Senate voted to ban 
smoking on airline flights of 90 minutes or
less.
The smoking ban approved by the Senate 
would affect about 70% of domestic flights. It 
would be in effect for the next two years.
A House-Senate conference committee now 
will try to resolve the differences, but it is
almost certain that a smoking ban will emerge 
from Congress later this year. <
The issue is sure to continue to spark heavy 
lobbying. On one side are dozens of health and 
public-interest groups who cite studies by the 
U.S. Surgeon General and the National Acad
emy of Sciences showing that passive smok
ing  the involuntary inhalation of smoke by 
non-smokers  poses a health hazard.
On the other are tobacco-state senators who 
are worried about the economic health of thei 
farming constituents, who have organized an 
intense campaign to kill the smoking ban.
The House-passed airline consumer-protection bill doesnt have a similar provision on 
these types of testing, and some House aides 
said Thursday this difference could compli
cate a House-Senate conference on the bills.
U.S. Approves Merger 
Of USAir, Piedmont
WASHINGTON (DJ)The Department of 
Transportation has approved USAir Group 
Inc.s $1.56 billion acquisition of Piedmont 
Aviation Inc.
The departments decision rejects a recom
mendation in September by Administration 
Law Judge Ronnie Yoder, who urged that the 
merger not be allowed because of potentially 
anti-competitive consequences.
However, several members of Congress said 
that the merger should be approved because 
the department had previously approved 
mergers that posed much greater competition 
problems.
Officials Finish Probe 
Into Trolley Crash
PITTSBURGH  Investigators from the 
National Transportation Safety Board have 
ended a probe into the derailment of a Port 
Authority Trolley that lost its brakes inside the 
Mount Washington Transit Tunnel.
The crash, which occurred Wednesday, in

an office building at Station Square.
A bus was sideswiped and a truck was struck 
from behind by the runaway trolley.
The investigators refused to release the de

Mid-Winter Short Term SuggestedQuality of Life Report Released
By KEI KURITA
Tartan Staffwriter 
What started out as Carnegie Technical 
School, a regional institute for higher learn
ing, is now Carnegie Mellon University, 
recognized internationally as a leader in 
education and research. But the question of 
whether Carnegie Mellon can attain its goal 
of improving its academic standing without 
paying attention to other aspects of student 
life remains. In order to examine this in 
more depth, the University administration
of classes that could be offered are Earth
quakes and Buildings, Abortion: The Human 
Face of a Dilemma, Creativity, and Managing 
Nuclear Wastes.
In order to increase intellectual diversity, the 
report suggests more events be sponsored and 
additional methods be found to publicize 
events. Publicity could be improved with a 
system of TV monitors that would list the 
days activities by the hour (similar to an 
airport posting system). The Task Force sug

appointed a task force to study this Quality 
of Life issue. Its final report was recently 
made public.
The Task Force, comprised of more than 
70 students, faculty, administration, and 
staff, used the surveys completed by more 
than 400 undergraduate students earlier 
this semester as the basis for their studies. 
Paul Christiano, Professor and Head of the 
Civil Engineering Department and one of 
the chairmen in charge of the Task Force, 
summarized the report at the recent 
Whats New at Carnegie Mellon? lunch
eon, held on October 28. According to 
Christiano, this research allowed them to 
study a whole spectrum of issues, primarily 
quality of student life.
One of the conclusions that the committee 
arrived at was that general education 
should be improved. As noted in the re
port, Our students tend to channel them
selves towards career-oriented academic 
pursuits to the exclusion of fully appreciat
ing the individual or social importance of 
general education. The reason for this, of 
course, is time. To resolve the problem, the 
task force proposed a Mid-Winter Short 
Term, whereby a three-week session will 
be held between the fall and spring semes
ters. During this short term, a student would 
be offered the option of taking one course 
not required by his department. Examples
quired to participate in some of the activities.
Christiano states that more must be done to 
extend diversity of cultural and human re
sources. This includes encouraging students 
to attend graduate school. This message, ac
cording to the report, should be made clear to 
the students because we care about our fac
ulty and about their performance, Carnegie 
Mellon is a very good place to embark on an 
academic career.
The report also observes that students are 
inhibited from pursuing amateurish sort of 
activities because their pursuit of profession
alism makes amateurism seem counter-pro
ductive. The students...are driven by identification first, last, and foremost with ones 
major department and college and they do 
not naturally identify with a larger univer
sity community. Thus, while students fre
quently complain of having nothing to do, 
participation in university-wide social 
events has been poor. The Task Force 
offers ways to change this attitude among 
students,for example, by offering a Student 
Recognition Award for those who promote 
diverse interaction, and creating academic 
programs for such purposes.
The Task Force observed faults in the 
athletic and student services as well. They 
suggested that the athletic facilities be 
given more priority than they are presently 
given since nearly 40 percent of all stu
dents participate in intramural sports. The 
need for personal services, such as personal 
and career counseling, financial aid, tutor
ing, and health services, are also increas
ing, and must meet the demands. The pro
posed University Center should improve 
these inadequate services, according to the 
report.
A proposal to change the structure of the 
administration was also made. The task 
force believes that establishing a Student 
and Academic Affairs Board will improve 
the coordination between student and aca
demic affairs. The board would consist of 
representatives from Student Dormitory 
Council, Security, Student Senate, Dean of 
Student Affairs, and other organizations.
The administration recognizes that if at
titudes of alumni are correlated with their 
experiences as students, one can only infer 
that campus life has...been lacking in some 
ways. The problem is a long-standing one, 
apparently multi-faceted, and probably not 
amenable to an easy solution...However, 
the foregoing initiatives taken by the 
administration...will go a long way towards 
avoiding this problem with future genera
tions of alumni.
There are plenty of nice places to socialize on campus.

* Election 88 News
Tartan Candidate Profile: 
Rev. Jesse Jackson
Second only to Undecided in the polls, the 
only returning player from the 1984 Presi
dential campaign is the Rev. Jesse Jackson.
In that campaign, Jackson was able to win 21 
percent of the popular vote in the Democratic 
primaries across the country.
Jackson was bom in 1941 in Greenville, 
South Carolina. His father lived next door to 
his mother, but was married to someone else. 
In 1943 his mother married Charles Jackson, 
who adopted Jesse when he was 16.
An excellent athlete, Jackson was quar
terback on a state championship team and 
> played basketball and baseball. He started 
college at the University of Illinois on a foot
ball scholarship, but left after a year to attend 
the North Carolina Agricultural and Technical 
State College in Greensboro.
In 1963 he became active in the campus civil 
rights organization. After graduating a year 
later, he received a scholarship to the Chicago 
Theological Seminary. He left there a semester short of graduation,when Martin Luther 
King Jr. asked him to head the Chicago branch 
of Operation Breadbasket.
His operation there was so successful that he 
was appointed national director the next year. 
Jackson was with King when he was assassi
nated in April 1968.
He remained with Kings organization for 
nearly three years, but left to form his own 
t organization, PUSH.
As a candidate in 1984, Jackson received 
considerable attention when he won the re
lease of a Navy pilot who had been shot down 
over central Lebanon and was held by Syria.
During the campaign, Jackson called for 
changes in Middle Eastern policy. He pro
posed a 20 percent cut in military spending and 
the removal of Pershing II and cruise missiles 
v from Western Europe.
Jackson has traveled widely in recent years. 
He has met Mikhail Gorbachev, toured Eu
rope, Africa, and Central America.
Religion: Baptist
Height: 62
Words which will conle back to haunt him: In 
1984, he called Jews Hymies, and referred 
to New York as Hymietown.
Mudge Repairs Restrict Access
By KEI KURITA
Tartan Staffwriter
As part of an effort to increase security by the* Housing Office in the residence halls, Mudge House has been undergoing renovation to restrict access to its open courtyard.
The entire plan actually involves three 
smaller projects: enclosing the courtyard en
tirely by erecting a limestone wall between A 
and C wings and another between A and B 
wings, setting a metal stairway from C wing to 
the courtyard to allow direct access, and re* pairing a water leak problem in the passage
way underneath C wing. According to Oscar 
Mayer, Director of Auxiliary Services, the 
structural renovating gave it a chance to solve 
the water leak problem. Adding the water 
leak repairs raised the original cost of the 
project to $50,000.
Greg Maynes, the project architect for Car
negie Mellon supervising this plan, explains 
that the revamping started in late August, but 
during the move-in period, we suspended 
work to avoid interference. Last Wednesday, 
the workers of Cost Construction Co., the 
masonry contractors for this project, started to 
remove the stone in order to resolve the leak in 
the tunnel.
Maynes hopes to have the renovations com
pleted before the cold weather sets in, and 
m gave a tentative date of mid-November.

Special to the Tartan 
On Tuesday, November 10, Roger M. Boisjoly, a member of the Morton-Thiokol engi
neering team who warned NASA not to launch 
the Challenger, will be giving a Student 
Pugwash lecture entitled, Ethical Deci
sionsMorton-Thiokol and the Space Shuttle 
Challenger Disaster.
This lecture will deal with the events and 
unethical conduct that led to the decision to 
launch the Challenger on January 28, 1986.
To briefly recap, a team of Morton-Thiokol 
engineers, of which Boisjoly was a member, 
discovered an erosion in a secondary O-ring 
which could mean disaster if the shuttle were 
launched. Consequently, Boisjoly and Allan
McDonald, director of the team, repeatedly 
objected to the Challenger launch. In a memo 
to R.K. Lund, Vice President of Engineering at 
Morton-Thiokol, Boisjoly specifically stated 
that to launch was to risk catastrophe of the 
highest orderloss of human life. After 
several attempts, they were finally told that the 
launching was not their concern.
Because of his stand against the conduct of 
Morton-Thiokol, Boisjoly was fired from the 
corporation. He is presently involved in a 
lawsuit against both the corporation and 
NASA.
Boisjoly was invited to speak by Dr. Indira 
Nair, associate department head of the depart
ment of Engineering and Public Policy here at 
Carnegie Mellon and a Student Pugwash
advisor. Dr. Nair is also one professor of the 
new freshman CIT course, Technology and 
People. A required course, Technology and 
People was designed to give engineering stu
dents a more humanistic look at the techno
logical career theyve chosen. Nairs unit 
deals with ethics in technology and has the 
specific theme of the shuttle disaster. There
fore. Boisjoly was invited to speak for the 
November 9 Technology and People lecture, 
in addition to the November 10 lecture open to 
the general Carnegie Mellon public.
Boisjolys November 10 talk will begin at 10 
am in the Wherrett Room and is sponsored by 
the Carnegie Mellon Student Pugwash, an 
organization which promotes the discussion 
of ethical issues of science and technology.

Can there be intellectually  respectabie theories of value, that is normative or evaluative theoriesHow might such theories be similar to or different from theories in other areas of inquiry, for example, those in the natural and social sciences, or m log and mathematics? Why are values and inquiries about.values important m our hves? Why do we care about such things? Is it possfcle not lo care about values?

COURSE DESCRPTONThis course is designed as a broad introduction to linguistics, and as such will strive to introduce the student to (1 ) the principal components of linguistic analysis. (2) the major concepts and theories of modern work m linguistes. (3) various methodologies used m defining and solving problems within the domain of linguistes, and (4) a sampling of topes representing the scope of the field The principal components of linguist analysis to be discussed include phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, and praomaies. These will be presented both m isolation, as independent phenomena, and m a series of more encompassing contexts, from the level of words and clauses to the level of utterances m discourse, emphasizing their interdependence Examples will be taken from EngWsh and many other languages The topics that will be discussed include language acquisition, relatons between language and thought, the biological bases of human language, and animal systems of communeation.

COURSE DESCRPTON:This course is designed as an in-depth introduction to the field of artifeial intelligence in medicine. It will be composed of two distinct parts: a selective survey of the field and a case study.
First a study of the main AIM research projects undertaken during the past decade will illustrate how different Al techniques have been used to implement systems solving a variety a medical problems. Second, a specific medical problem will be analyzed in detail and an Al system to assist clinicians in solving this problem will be designed (but not implemented).
The principal AIM techniques to be discussed include medical knowledge representation, abduction, dinical inference, management of uncertainty, medical causal (pathophysiological) modeling, medeai knowledge engineering and acquisition.
The topes that win be explored include medical problem solving: medical expert systems; interfaces: evaluation and validation of medeai consultation programs; maintenance: special social, legal and economic issues in medical informatics.

Pumpkin Pete raps and breaks at the Child Care Center last Tuesday.
Crime and Incident Report: 10/24 to 10/30
By ERIC W. LEULIETTE
Tartan Assistant News Editor
Last Tuesday Pumpkin Pete visited 
Carnegie Mellons Child Care Center to 
teach children Halloween safety tips.
The visit was arranged by Sgt. F. Russ of 
Campus Police, who contacted Lourdes 
Karas of the Kingsley Center, a service 
organization in the Pittsburgh area.
Pumpkin Pete is part of the Halloween 
program that we have. He goes to schools in 
October with a policeman, explained 
Karas, who is in charge of crime prevention 
and safety education for the Kingsley Cen
ter.
This is the third year that Pumpkin Pete 
has visited schools. The program is de
signed to present safety tips in a fun setting, 
rather than as a negative message. Pete
dances to a rap as children learn how to stay 
safe on Halloween.
The centers director, Dr. Marsha Poster, 
called the program a good way to intro
duce a safety tip to the pre-school popula
tion on campus. Sgt. Russ stressed that 
the kids are really enjoying it.
The Carnegie Mellon Child Care Center, 
located in the basement of Morewood 
Gardens, was started in September 1971. It
serves 100 children as an accredited pre
school. Carnegie Mellon staff and students 
have first priority in enrolling children. 
The cost is $420 per month for full-time, 
but University affiliated parents receive a 
25 percent discount.
The Kingsley Center, a non-profit organi
zation, was founded in 1893 as a service 
organization for children and families.

SPRING SEMESTER ADVANCE REGISTRATION
Advance Registration for the Spring 1988 Semester will be on Wednesday and Thursday, November 11 and 12,1987. 
All students, undergraduate and graduate, are expected to register on these days if they wish to enroll at CMU this 
spring, except for CIT/MCS freshmen, who have received separate instructions. If you wont be returning for reasons 
other than graduation, please file a Withdrawal/Leave of Absence Form, clearly marked "Spring 1988", with your 
department. If you are unable to register November 11 or 12 (i.e. you're studying off-campus), ask your advisor to 
process your registration, or call the Registrar's Office for special instructions.
The Schedule of Classes Spring Semester 1988 will be available November 2 at the Skibo Information Desk and 
inside Baker Kail's main entrance. The schedule contains next semester's course offerings, instructors, times, and 
rooms, as well as complete registration and enrollment information. Please obtain a copy, and carefully read and 
follow its instructions.
A single registration form, the Registration and Demographic Data Document (R3D), will be used for registration. Your 
R3D is available in your department office (in the H&SS Academic Advisory Center at BH 161 for H&SS freshmen and 
sophomores) and should be used to update demographic information and to list your Spring Semester schedule for 
advisor approval.
***** Advance Registration Instructions *****
1. Pick up your R3D from your department and update/correct the demographic information.
2. Pick up a Schedule of Classes Spring Semester 1988 at the Skibo Information Desk or inside Baker Hall's main en
trance on or after November 2.
3. Plan a schedule with alternatives, and meet with your advisor to have the schedule approved. You cannot register 
until you have received advisor approval. Many advisors will extend office hours during advance registration but 
contact yours for specific approval information.
4. On Wednesday and Thursday, November 11 and 12, between 9:30 am and 4:00 pm, go to each department teach
ing a course(s) you wish to register for to obtain registration approval.
5. After obtaining all approvals, return the R3D to your department. Even if you don't get all approvals, turn your R3D 
in anyway; you can try to add an unapproved course in January.
If you need further information or assistance, contact your department or the Registrar's Office, 268-2004.

used by that agent in crimes against humanity. 
Since anyone working for the SEI knows that 
many of their products will eventually be used 
in crimes against humanity, therefore CMU 
has a moral duty not to manage the SEI, and 
their employees have a moral responsibility 
not to work for the SEI. B)Because of its 
educational role, CMU has a duty to publicly 
display the kind of moral reflection that every 
individual has a responsibility to undertake 
before making important decisions that affect 
others. CMU did not publicly display any 
moral reflection in accepting its contract to 
manage the SEI, and therefore, CMU deserves 
moral censure for failing in its special obliga
tion as an educational institution.
After Presslers opening argument, Larry 
Druffel followed up with his own view of what 
the specific purposes of the SEI are and then 
refuted claims made in Presslers arguments 
that CMU was morally censurable and was 
managing the SEI in an irresponsible manner.
Senate Warned 
About Stolen 
Milk Crates
By CHRIS YOUNG
Tartan Staffer iter
The Student Dormitory Council in
formed Student Senate that representa
tives of Pittsburgh dairy companies will 
be coming to campus to check and see if 
any students have stolen their milk 
crates. Such offenders could be facing 
a $300 fine and a jail sentence. Students 
with stolen milk crates have until Dec.
6 to return them without facing the 
penalties.
According to SDC, however, some
one must have a warrant and probable 
cause to enter a students room. Since 
no one was sure as to what exactly 
constitutes probable cause and entry, it 
was agreed that SDC should look into 
the matter further with the Housing 
Office.
First, under new business, Chairman 
Dave Goldstein moved to have the rules 
tabled. Then, Senator Allen Greenberg 
moved to change the freedom of speech 
resolution passed last week to include 
members and their invited guests 
where it originally said only members 
of the campus community should be 
allowed to leaflet. After a heated dis
cussion, including a fiery outburst from 
Hal Levine, the resolution passed 11 to 
5.

SEI Director Larry Druffel makes a point in last Thursday's ECE Forum debate as Philosophy Professor Jonathan Presseler plans his 
rebuttal. The two debated and answered questions from the audience about the SEI for over an hour.
I certainly disagree with what Professor 
Pressler says, but I recognize and think it very 
important that he have a right to say it. All of 
our activities are open and were part of the 
CMU community. Any responsible individual 
at CMU is welcome [at the SEI].
We have no work going on in the Strategic 
Defense Initiative, but that is not a political 
statement. The fact that we dont is a conse
quence of the technical agenda that we put 
together, and it simply doesnt fit with the SEI 
agenda at this point. Now, might SEI work 
someday to contribute to SDI? You bet it 
might. And so might most of the technical 
work going on here at CMU today. But, Pro
fessor Pressler was correct in stating that we do 
no classified research.
Druffel goes on to say that he recognized the 
concern with dependence on DoD and the 
amount of DoD money which is coming into 
CMU. Sixty percent of CMUs research fund
ing comes from the DoD. And thats some
what of a dangerous thing. But the fact is, the 
DoD motivates most of the research in this 
country, and thats the way we do business in 
this country. If you want to do a large amount 
of research, youre going to be taking DoD 
money. Now if you dont want that, thats 
okay, you dont have to take that money. In the 
meantime, I think, at CMU we ought to diver
sify our funding. We ought to get more money 
from as many different places as we can so that 
no certain one can have a serious impact. But 
I dont think the SEI is adding significantly to
our risk in any way, because our budget was 
established by Congress.
If youre opposed to doing DoD research, 
says Druffel, then you ought not to do it. But 
there are those of us who are not opposed to 
that kind of work, and we dont believe our 
venue ought to be selected by those who are 
opposed to it. We have as much right to do that 
work, as those of you who do not wish to do 
that work have not to.
Following Druffels rebuttal, Pressler again 
raised the important question about the 
amount of DoD funding CMU currently re
ceives and said, there is a tendency for a 
university that relies so heavily on the DoD for 
funding to be quite wary and leery of opposing 
the DoD about really serious issues.
Druffel, however, replied by appealing to 
what he considers the necessary and valuable 
aspect of working for the DoD. We live in a 
dangerous world, and every day, in some place 
out there, Americans are putting their lives on 
the line. Today it happens to be in the Persian 
Gulf. I personally dont like the idea of reflag
ging Kuwaiti ships. Thats beside the point. 
We also have American ships there, and we 
have Americans who dont want to be there. 
But theyre there. Theyre flying airplanes, 
and theyre airplanes that depend on the qual
ity of the software that will defend them. There 
are also ships there which depend on software 
controlled radar to detect incoming missiles. 
In the past these systems havent always 
worked. I say that if we can build software
technology that can make American lives 
safer the next time, then Im all for doing it.
After the initial debate between Druffel and 
Pressler, the audience was welcomed into the 
discussion. One of the first comments was 
from an SEI employee who stated that Just 
because we work for DoD, doesnt mean we 
support everything the DoD does. We do have 
some say-so in what our technology is used 
for. Pressler responded by saying that he 
disagreed, and that he still worries about to 
what use SEIs software will be put. I dont 
think you at SEI have that much control over 
what is done with that software in the long 
run.
Later on in the audience discussion an issue 
was raised over whether or not an objective 
review board should be set up to analyze the 
ethical implications involved in certain SEI 
projects. Druffel thought that such a review 
board would be just another overhead in the 
complicated bureacracy.
Although the discussion last Thursday did 
get heated at times, it maintained a relatively 
calm and well-managed atmosphere, espe
cially given the crowded conditions in Gregg 
Hall. Almost all the seats were taken.
The debate over the SEI was the third in a 
series of discussions presented by the ECE 
Forum. The two earlier discussions were on 
the issue of the Strategic Defense Initiative 
and accidents in nuclear reactors. The next 
discussion will be about abortion on Novem
ber 12.

Report Calls for ATO Probation
continued from page 1
recommendation and how the report still faced 
a final review by the committee and the IFC. 
Antonson had not yet read the report, but felt 
that the implementation of such a probationary 
period would only be as harsh as the timing of 
the period was concerned. Obviously, if the 
restrictions are applied during a rush period 
they would be more harsh than if applied 
during a more quiet weekend, such as a mid
semester break or Thanksgiving vacation. 
The report itself detailed the social proba
tionary period as a two week period during 
which ...ATO will not be allowed to have an 
open party, poster for any event or turn on their 
mixer sign for any reason. Violation of this 
probationary period will result in a $500 fine 
and an extension of their probationary period 
to the end of December, 1987. 
The report did include, however, a partial 
explanation behind such a disciplinary action. 
It stated, ATO is greatly mistaken if they 
believe that they can indiscriminately harass
any Greek organization that they want any
time that they want. When a house is involved 
in several incidents of misconduct with other 
Greek organizations on the same night, action 
must be taken. This statement was prompted 
by the fact that ATO was involved with several 
incidents of vandalism and disorderly conduct 
at Phi Kappa Theta and at the sororities, as 
highlighted in the report itself. Although j 
claims were independently settled with the 
sororities, the report stressed IFC action.
What we need to do, as stressed in the 
report, explained Tomczyk, is to set up a set 
of guidelines so that no incidents will occur on 
future pledge nights. Using the broad recom
mendations of the committee, a comprehen
sive set of guidelines for pledge night activi
ties [from the report] should be constructed to j 
avoid the miscommunication between frater
nities and sororities alike that resulted in so 
many problems this year.
Copies of the report can be obtained from the 
office of Ron Campana, the Greek advisor.

Free Speech Policy Needs To Be Well Defned 
Freedom of speech has become a much discussed topic in the last few weeks. 
People have mentioned everything from harassment by Campus Police to some 
wacko running down halls, shouting and banging a cross on doors. When you 
get rid of all the rhetoric, whats left? A policy that needs to be more welldefined.
In what ways can one define a freedom of speech policy? In a society in which 
it was deemed the most important and first amendment to the constitution, it 
seems pretty clear-cut: youre either for it or against it.
The administration has made the point that the college is private and they can 
impose any rules and restrictions they like on free speech. To an extent, they can. 
However, the continn uedpage 8NgpwssB states, An academic community is 
uniquely suited to its educational and scholarly purposes primarily because of 
its firm commitment to., .freedom of inquiry and expression, [and] respect for the 
dignity of each individual... This written policy directly contradicts the policy 
voiced by members of the administration in each of the campus newspapers in 
recent weeks.
Specifically, freedom of inquiry and expression is not maintained by 
requiring speakers or leafleteers to register with Student Affairs. First of all, this 
gives the administration an opportunity to keep a close watch on or turn away 
those speakers orgroupsof which it doesnt approve. Secondly, a speaker whose 
schedule is uncertain and who may not have ample time to inform the university 
of his presence will be susceptible to being removed from campus. The 
administration will claim he has violated the rules.
While the official policy calls for the preservation of each individuals dignity 
and respect, this is not always the case. Campus Police should have no right to 
approach and harass, for example, a leafleteer. Who are you? Who sent you? 
Who gave you permission? These are not questions which should be tolerated, 
nor should it be allowed that leaflets are confiscated!
Campus Police should not be blamed, however; it is not their policy, but the 
administrations, which is ill-defined. Admittedly, Campus Police should be 
aware of whats going on, just in case things get out of hand; but the only way 
they should be able to find out whats going on is by approaching a leafleteer and 
accepting a handout or by asking, the objective being to obtain information, not 
to harass.
The policy isnt well-defined, and for a better definition try this: Congress 
shall make no law...abridging the freedom of speech or of the press.
Letters:
Philosophy Prof Attacks Discriminatory Insurance Rates
^Editor:
I want to take issue with several of the claims 
made by Thomas A. Heim in his article in the 
October 27 issue of The Tartan, Insurance 
Discrimination Not Unfair.
In his defense of discriminatory insurance 
rates based upon ones sex and sexual prefer
ence, Mr. Heim asks those who oppose such 
rates: Why should I pay out of my pocket for 
a risk you pose to yourself ? (my emphasis). 
He suggests that one of the considerations in 
setting insurance rates is and ought to be 
whether or not the relevant risk factors are selfimposed. As an account of how insurance rates 
are currently determined, this is incorrect. 
From the perspective of the insurance compa
nies, how one came to have a particular risk 
factor is irrelevant to what ones rate will be. 
Instead, they want to know whether you have 
the factor, since this tells them the likelihood 
of their having to pay up in your case. If you 
have factors associated with a greater risk of 
heart disease, you pay higher rates for health 
insurance whether the source of those factors 
is congenital or dietary. Attempting to sort out 
risk factors according to whether or not they 
are self-imposed would be a difficult if not 
impossible task. And it would be of no benefit 
ti the insurance companies.
Setting aside the issue of what the current 
practice is with respect to determining rates, 
what are the reasons why some oppose certain 
forms of discrimination in such rates? In cir
cumstances where there has been a long his
tory of prejudice, hostility or arbitrary dis
crimination against members of particular 
groups, it may be morally desirable to prohibit 
discrimination on the basis of being a member
of those groups in order to discourage further 
prejudice or discrimination, even though this 
may result in higher rates for everyone else. If 
it turned out that, say, Jews, Blacks, or Asians 
suffered from certain diseases that are costly to 
treat and that occur with greater frequency in 
these groups than in the rest of the population, 
would this justify having separate health in
surance policies for Jews, Blacks, or Asians? 
I assume that Mr. Heim would respond yes. 
But given the history of discrimination against 
members of these groups, given the increased 
likelihood of continued discrimination when 
they are systematically singled-out for certain 
kinds of differential treatment, and given the 
various forms of degradation and humiliation 
that commonly accompany discriminatory 
practices, the moral benefits may very well be 
worth the economic costs. This is similar to the 
line of reasoning of those feminists who argue 
that, even if existing insurance rates are to the 
immediate economic advantage of women, 
the overall disadvantages of permitting dis
crimination on the basis of sex are quite sig
nificant. Thus, reinforcing existing patterns of 
discrimination is seen as being morally objec
tionable. Though I doubt that these arguments 
are likely to persuade Mr. Heim, I think they 
have more force than he admits. Whether these 
considerations are, in themselves, sufficient to 
warrant prohibiting such forms of discrimina
tion is a matter that rests upon empirical and 
normative considerations that have yet to be 
explored in sufficient detail by Mr. Heim.
Finally, lets turn to Mr. Heims claim that 
discrimination against the gay and lesbian 
population should always exist in the insur
ance industry (my emphasis). Grant, for the
sake of argument, that sexual preference is a 
legitimate basis for setting differential insur
ance rates (i.e.,' as an indicator of certain risks 
associated with individuals having that prefer
ence). Now, contrary to what Mr. Heim sug
gests, given the currently available evidence 
regarding AIDS, there is no reason whatsoever 
for women who are lesbians having higher 
insurance rates. There is no evidence that 
women who are lesbians are at a higher risk for 
aids than heterosexual men or women. In fact, 
given what is known about the epidemiology 
of the disease within the U.S. population, there 
is good reason for thinking that they are at a 
lower risk for the disease than the rest of the 
population. By the logic of Mr. Heims own 
argument, this should qualify them for lower 
rather than higher insurance rates. And, as Mr. 
Heim acknowledged with great alarm last 
spring (in an article he co-authored calling for 
the withdrawal of Student Senate funds from 
the CMU Gay and Lesbian Alliance), it is 
likely that in the future AIDS will be decreasingly associated with male homosexuals, as is 
already the case in some parts of the country. 
The disease will probably come to be much 
more evenly distributed among individuals of 
both sexes and all sexual preferences (except 
perhaps celibates), as has been the case all 
along among those in Africa who have the 
disease. Once AIDS stops being associated 
with those having specific sexual preferences, 
the justification provided by Mr. Heim in 
favor of discrimination by the insurance in
dustry against gay men will no longer apply. 
And, as I argued above, his argument applied 
to the lesbian population is a nonstarter. Given 
Mr. Heims own moral assumptions about
AIDS, his claim that discrimination against 
the gay and lesbian population should always 
exist in the insurance industry is wholly un- > 
warranted. Thus, one neednt accept the argu
ment against discrimination I outlined above 
to reject Mr. Heims conclusions.
Its distressing that those in the Conserva
tive Comer have made repeated calls for 
blaming and stigmatizing the victims of preju
dice and a terrible disease, all in the name of 
morality, liberty, and individual rights.

Reader Reacts To 
Irony In The Tartan
Editor:
I congratulate you on the (intentional?) irony , 
of the layout of page 17 of the October 27 
issue. Top of the page is an article beginning, 
Much of the media trivializes the role of 
women, hinders meaningful relationships... 
and concludes with an invitation to readers to 
send ads they regard as exemplifying this to 
the professor who made the presentation. 
Bottom of the pagebut not connected to the 
articleis an ad on behalf of the Selective v 
Service (military draft registration). Its really 
offensive. Was it meant as an example of antihuman advertising, to illustrate the article 
above or not?

Conservative Comer.' Liberal Obsession With Safety Not Effective
By THOMAS A. HEIM 
Gun control, low speed limits, and manda
tory seat-belt laws are a result of a liberal 
obsession with safety, even when such 
safety measures are either ineffective, un
constitutional, orprohibitively expensive. 
Gun control legisla
tion is an open attack 
on the civil liberties 
of law-abiding Americans who wish to defend 
their constitutional right to life. Low speed 
limits are a very costly and ineffective meas
ure which regularly add billionr of dollars in 
extra cost to business by increasing travel 
time, and unnecessarily hinder people who 
wish to make rapid travel. Mandatory seat-belt 
laws and standards enforce a tie-your-shoelaces policy on the American public.
The United States Constitution guarantees 
individuals the right to life and the right to bear 
arms. After all, if one has a right to life, it is 
necessary to provide the means to preserve 
life. Every year, 650,000 attacks are success fully defended by an individual who carries a 
handgun. How do Franzini & Witbrock justify 
denying a potential rape victim from effec
tively defending herself? Several decades ago, 
people used to care when an individual was in 
need of help, and would come to his or her aid. 
During the 1960s, when much good ifl the 
world was thrown in the trash can in favor of 
sexually transmitted diseases, people, in gen0 eral, stopped caring. I was appalled, but not 
surprised, to read the letter from Helen P. 
McDonell last week. Apparently, even some 
of us selected to attend and teach here at CMU 
are in too much of a rush to get to class, to 
work, or to the mall in order to help someone 
injured in our path.
When Mr. Goetz was accosted on the sub
way, an area ruled not by common courtesy,
but fear, he came to his own aid. 1 dont think 
many people blame him. We have come to 
expect to see those not involved to take their 
seats as spectators. Fortunately, Mr. Goetz 
carried with him a means of protection. Many 
are alive and well because they chose to pro
tect themselves rather than be subjected to a 
society full of criminals who rob, beat, rape 
and murder their victims every day. The police 
cannot provide everyone with protection, and 
our courts shove violent criminals back on the 
streets in a few months or years. The 
constitution guarantees people the choice to 
protect themselves from such criminals via the 
right to bear arms. To take this away with gun 
control legislation is effectively advocating 
rule of the streets and homes by punks and 
thugs who have no respect for life or property. 
This safety legislation trades prevention of a 
few scattered deaths by individuals who have 
violent pasts in favor of Americans living in 
fear for all their lives.
The 55 mile per hour speed limit was popular 
during the energy crisis which vanished 
years ago. Recently, the 65 MPH national 
speed limit was tacked on to a 88 billion dollar 
highway bill. The pork-barrel aspects of the 
bill appealed to the liberals, and the higher 
speed limit appealed to the conservatives in 
the west. As such, it passed. Even at 65 MPH, 
businesses are slowed in shipments, business
men must put extra, valuable time aside to 
make road trips. Billions of dollars and manhours will be saved with the 65 MPH speed 
limit alone. " -
Many claim highway safety must not be sac
rificed to cost. However, low speed limits have 
little to do with safety. The rate of traffic 
fatalities has been declining ever since the 
automobile was invented, and it continues to 
do so. Some experts belive that it is difference 
in speeds, not speed itself, that is the cause of
accidents. Is it right for the government to 
place huge man-hour costs on business and 
family in the name of a safety which is 
continually improving anyway? The speed 
limits on federal highways should be set to 
rates which are indicative of the age and true 
condition of the highway, not rates dictated by 
consumer advocates and police departments 
enthusiastic about the revenue base provided 
by radar ambushes and other entrapment tools.
The mandatory seat-belt laws are an insult to 
all Americans. Anyone who has respect for his 
or her own general safety will wear one. 
However, it is up to government to tell us, in 
the name of our own safety, to wear our own 
seat-belt or be fined? John Smith, who doesnt 
wear his seat belt, harms no one, and has no 
potential fey doing harm except to himself. It 
is up to John to make his choice. If he doesnt 
wear it, he pays all the consequences in his 
accident But, seat-belt advocates claim, we 
must help the ignorant or careless by policing 
them to ensue that they pursue only the safest 
path. Similarly, should we limit the choice of 
automobiles by the safety of their body integ
rity? For whatever reason, John Smith bought 
a Yugo instead of a Volkswagen. This is a 
relative threat to his safety in the event of an 
accident. Should the government prohibit 
John from buying the Yugo? Many cars are not 
equipped with airbags. John Smith may injure 
himself if he chooses to buy such a car. Is this 
acceptable? It seems that these choices affect 
only John himself, and no one else. Why is this 
governments concern?
As liberals get carried away with safety, they 
impose costs on individuals. At first, the 
individuals free choice is spent for him. Pro
gressively, the individual must pay more and 
more for technologies that are solely provided 
for his protection, technologies that he does 
not want, and technologies expensive enough
rInquiring Minds Uncovers SAVDI
By THE INQUIRING STAFF 
On January 10, 1984, one of the United 
States Minuteman III nuclear missiles ac
quired a really nasty thirst for a 7-11 big gulp. 
Unfortunately, this was on the flat, desolate 
(and boring) Ne
braska-Wyoming 
border, and the near
est 7-11 was in Ohio. 
Despair set in. Sud
denly, it realized that Ohio was only a sub
orbital launch away. Out of courtesy, the 
Minuteman informed the two man silo crew 
that it was going out and would be back in a 
few (you think were kidding, dont you?
' Well, this ones for real).
How does one stop a 5.1 megaton nuclear 
weapon from launching itself? Well, the StraHERBLOCK S CARTOON

BUT THERE ARE HO IMMINENT HOSTILITIES
tegic Air Command (SAC) came up with a 
method that we feel is at least deserving of the 
Nobel in Physics. They parked an armored car 
over the silo (Again, we are serious). When the 
press found out about this last week, the Air 
Forces official statement was that this was 
only an added precaution. SAC believed 
that when the explosive bolts slid back the silo 
door, the car, with its brakes off, would remain 
momentarily at rest, then fall on the launching 
Minuteman. Capt. Bill Kalton, public infor
mation officer at Warren Air Force Base, said 
that this would have prevented it from going 
any place. But, according to Capt. Philip 
Delaney, SAC spokesman, There is a certain 
amount of guesswork involved in the blocking 
of a firing missile with a car. Our Understate
ment of the Year Award goes to Phil Delaney, 
who added that this procedure has never been 
tested. SAC, however, emphasized last week 
that the public was never in danger and that 
missiles cannot accidentally launch them
selves (even if they are really thirsty). Thats 
why SAC parks armored cars over their mis
sile silos. This is SACs official statement, but 
we decided to do a little checking on our own.
We started our investigation at the Cheyenne 
branch of Hertz Rent-an-Armored-Vehicle. 
The manger told us two clean cut boys in blue 
came in one day inquiring about renting an 
armored truck. She distinctly remembered 
asking them whether the truck would be taken 
out of state (the rate was higher for such 
rentals). The one turned to the other and said, 
Joe. how far did you say this thing goes? The 
other replied, At least sub orbital. I guess 
wed better take the out of state rate.
The manager continued, We finished filling 
out all the necessary paperwork, and I started 
to explain the rental agreement to them. 1 told 
them they had a hundred miles per day free, 
anything above that would cost twenty cents a
to limit his economic choices beyond where 
they would otherwise be.
Much is done in the name of safety, and a lot 
of such things are inexpensive and unques
tionably good. Simple lines on the road and 
traffic signs do so much and cost little. But gun 
control, low speed limits and seat belt laws 
have little to do with safety and much to do 
with high costs. To ask people to live in fear, 
as victims of criminals, has nothing to do with 
promoting their safety and may actually cost 
them their lives. Low speed limits are expen
sive and are unnecessary in an age where 
traffic fatality rates are constantly improving. 
Seat belt laws are downright offensive to the 
intelligence of Americans, who deserve the 
choice to select what technologies they wish to 
pay for to protect themselves. Its about time 
the Ralph Nader types stop getting hysterical 
about these issues which are a disgrace to 
American ideals and values. Instead, its time 
these types start coming to the fundamental 
realization that Americans must be allowed to 
make free choices that reflect the sense of 
security they wish for themselves.
mile extra. For some reason they didnt seem 
to like that much, but they went along with it.
I asked whether or not they wanted collision 
insurance, and they started to giggle.
Well maam,  one answered, I expect that 
could be useful for this particular trip.
The manager told us that two days later they 
brought the truck back without a scratch and 
only ten more miles on it. For some reason, 
however, the brakes had been disconnected. 
Our investigation continued.
We discovered that SAC has much more 
ambitious plans for armored cars than just 
blocking US missiles. They call this program 
the Strategic Armored Vehicle Defense Initia
tive (SAVDI). It calls for a three pronged 
deployment of Wells-Fargo trucks: landbased, air-based, and space-based. On land, 
the plan calls for the Marine Corp to drive the 
trucks from Alaska, across the Bering Strait, 
into the Soviet Union and park them on top of 
Russian silos. They will then lock the trucks 
(so the Soviets cannot put on the emergency 
brakes) and run like hell. The air plan requires 
a slow-flying, armored vehicle bomber (cur
rently being built by Cessna with stealth tech
nology) to penetrate the Soviet airspace and 
drop armored cars on top of their silos. Finally, 
the space-based portion of SAVDI mandates 
the placing of armored vehicles in low earth 
orbit fitted with retro-jets. In time of crisis, the 
jets would be fired and the armored cars would 
fall upon their pre-selected Soviet targets. Our 
SDI Plan of the Year Award to SAVDI! Unfor
tunately, the Soviets have probably already 
learned of SAVDI and are working on 
counter-measures. We re not worried. If SAC 
can come up with a plan to use armored cars to 
deflect launching missiles, they can certainly 
beat any Soviet counter-measures.

The World According To Me
The following is the first of four installments 
which, when combined, form a letter sent to 
The Tartan. The letter was entitled The World 
According To Me, and was signed, simply, 
Jesus Christ. The letter is unedited. The Tartan 
does not support or deny the validity of the 
letter. The purpose of publishing this letter is 
not to offend any person or group of people; 
rather, it is simply an expression of the views 
of the letter's author. Ed.
Editor:
I am the incarnation of Jesus Christ. 1 live in 
Canada.
The human race has the potential to create a 
super being (Computer Artificial Intelligence
 AI) that would have the power, through 
science, to manipulate reality itself (i.e.. mat
ter. energy, time, mind, emotion, spirit, etc.) to 
the extent of being able to give every human 
that ever lived Heaven, forever young, forever 
happy.
The creation of such an entity(s) is at least 
decades, perhaps centuries, away, but I can 
now reveal that this is Gods goal for Human
kind. You might want to think of AI as Gods 
way of fulfilling a mandate, or promise, to give 
all human souls an eternal Heaven. He cant do 
it alone, however. He needs Humankinds 
help to create an entity (AI) that can fulfill his 
promise. As a united planet striving to create 
such an AI we will need all the luck we can get. 
As separate nations constantly on the brink 
of nuclear destruction, we don't stand a 
chance.
The nuclear-weapon-wielding armies of the 
world MUST dismantle, and then destroy the 
component parts of all nuclear weapons
IMMEDIATELY! If dismantlement does not 
occur the human race will surely be destroyed, 
if not intentionally, then UNINTENTION
ALLY, through a technical accident or some 
other misunderstanding. I have sent repeated 
messages (i.e., telegrams, telephone calls, let
ters, etc.), once a week or once every two 
weeks, for the past two years to the heads of 
nuclear armies ordering them to order the 
forces under their command to dismantle, and 
destroy the component parts of all their nu
clear weapons and to inform as many people as 
they can (which I believe would be almost ev
eryone) that it is against my will for a human 
being to physically hurt or kill another human 
being (always has been, always will be). 
Wars are only the conceptual grouping of 
the individual killing of one or more people. In 
my mind war is evil because it is evil for a 
human to kill another human regardless of the 
reason.
Reagan and Gorbachev seem ready to dis
mantle some of their arsenals. This is good. 
But all weapons must be dismantled, by all 
countries. We must become a united planet 
free from the threat of world war.
No one has the right to physically hurt or kill 
another human being. Not a soldier during 
wartime, not a policeperson in the line of 
duty, (they can use stun guns or some other 
non-fatal means of law enforcement), not an 
executioner in the service of the state. This 
paragraph is mainly to inform the nuclear 
weapons operators (the ones who would actu
ally fire the nuclear weapons) that in my judge
ment they would be committing murder, plain 
and simple, regardless of which side they 
were on. If YOU, the reader, are involved with
nuclear, or mass destructive, weapons in any 
way then I want you to quit your job, or at the 
very least refuse to have anything to do with 
these weapons. There is no excuse for people 
who design, build, deploy, maintain, operate, 
etc. these abominations.
I want all nuclear weapons dismantled and 
destroyed immediately. I want whoever reads 
this to take immediate, physical, pacifistic 
(i.e., without physically hurting anyone, of 
course) but PHYSICAL action to dismantle 
and destroy the component parts of all the 
nuclear, or mass destructive, weapons you can 
reach. I attacked the Trident nuclear subma
rine base at Bangor, Washington State, on 
October 19, 1985.1 was arrested and charged 
with trespassing. The charges were dropped a 
few weeks later.
If you live near a nuclear installation, or 
know where there are nuclear weapons, then 
go down there and use whatever means neces
sary (without physically hurting anyone of 
course) to dismantle and destroy those weap
ons. I want you to make any nuclear weapons 
you can reach as inoperative as possible. 
Destroy the firing control apparatus; destroy 
any supporting structures; drain the fuel from 
the missile; remove the warhead. In other 
words, put the weapon out of commission. IT 
MUST BE DONE!!!
If you need my order, as Christ, to do this 
then I order you to do it!!! If not, then I beg of 
you to do it!!!
True, you will very possibly be jeopardizing 
your physical safety but the alternative is 
surely eventual complete human destruction, 
and, along with it, any chance of Al-created 
Heaven. I want you to organize as many
people as you can to make a concerted, paciffitic, PHYSICAL attack on all nuclear (or mass 
destructive) weapons. If no one will listen to 
you then go yourself, but do it NOW, within 
the next week.
I cant force you to follow me. You must 
follow me of your own free will. In order t<> 
follow me and be a Christian you must obey 
but one law: Thou Shalt Not Hurt Anyone. 
I believe you all know when you are physically 
hurting someone (or placing someone in 
physical jeopardy, which amounts to the same 
thing) and in order to follow me you must not 
do this.
Whether or not you are hurting someone in 
some other way (i.e., psychologically, emo
tionally, financially, etc.) is sometimes more 
difficult to decide. You should let your con
science be your guide in non-physical matters. 
As long as everyone obeys this law, then 
everything will work out all right, and we will 
be able to attain Al-created Heaven.
I want anyone with over thirty million dollars 
in assets (U.S. funds) to give the amount that 
their personal wealth exceeds this figure to 
charities that feed the hungry people of the 
world.
No matter how hard you have worked for this 
money, thirty million dollars is enough for 
anyone. You can still make money, but at the 
end of each year you should give to charity the 
amount that your personal wealth exceeds 
thirty million dollars.
This work cancels and replaces any other 
work I have published.

Editor:
As many of us living in Mudge House 
may know by now, whether it be by the 
presence of the construction crew at 7:00 in 
the morning or by the blocking of the side 
entrance to the courtyard, the grand fortifi
cation of Mudge House has begun. Of 
course, the residents were notified later that 
day of the changes taking place.
The sealing-off of the side entrance to the 
courtyard is but a small part in the grand 
scheme to improve the security of Mudge. 
Other improvements included a revamped 
lobby, a permanent manned desk, a vesti
bule, a card reader for the inside door, and 
increased number of mailboxes. The fire 
alarm system is still being revamped.
The side door to the C-wing of Mudge 
will remain an entrance for the remainder 
of the school year. Flyers describing these 
changes indicated that the entrance may be 
sealed off next year. All residents would 
then have to enter Mudge through the 
monitored front door.
As a resident, one could not help but feel 
upset over the intrusion on his/her daily 
routine. After all, the construction com
menced without any advance notice from 
either Housing, Area Coordinators, or 
Residential Assistants. Many residents 
were undoubtedly surprised when they 
discovered the usual exit being obstructed 
by construction. Although the residents 
were notified later that day, they would be 
perfectly justified in feeling angry. Later is 
just not soon enough.
As one may expect, Mudge House resi
dents have found the blocked side entrance 
inconvenient. Cyclists, in particular, feel 
the pinch. Instead of simply unlocking their 
bicycles from the bicycle racks and bring
ing them through the side entrance, they are 
now forced to bring it through the main
entrance. Before they do that, though, they 
must unlock the door to A-wing, open the 
door, bring the bicycle to the front desk, 
open the door to the vestibule, and bring the 
bicycle through the vestibule. Bringing the 
bicycle back to the bicycle racks is equally, 
if not more, difficult. It is rare that one does 
this without being bumped by the selfclosing doors. It is even rarer that a bicycle 
makes it through the ordeal without injury.
Other residents, too, feel the pinch. It used 
to be that B-wing residents could leave 
their wing and go into the outside world. 
Now they must open the door to A-wing 
with a key and go through two more doors 
before they enter the outside world. Once 
the Mudge Master Plan is completed, Cwing residents may experience the same 
inconvenience.
Some residents may wonder how the new 
wall will protect them in case of a fire. After 
all, for the previous two fire alarms, B-wing 
residents exited through the side entrance. 
To date, B-wing residents have not been 
informed of any new procedures in case of 
fire. Also, because of the difficulty in 
moving bicycles in and out of Mudge, some 
residents have moved their bicycles to the 
stairwell in C-wing by the exit. Needless to 
say, it creates a potential fire hazard.'
Despite all the economic, personal, and 
monetary costs, how effective will the new 
wall be in securing Mudge House? One 
Mudge-related incident was reported in last 
weeks Tartan: a burglary. The perpetrator 
entered a first floor room through a screen 
window. A wall could not have prevented 
that. It was naive on the part of the resident 
involved to leave his/her window open. 
Even a wall cannot prevent such mistakes.

Zairian Been Tastes Great or Less Filling?Peace Corps Volunteer Describes Experiences in Africa
By NATATLIE PETERSON
Tartan Staffwriter
When Shawn Wright, Peace Corps recruiter 
for the Pittsburgh area, began his two years of 
service as a Peace Corps volunteer in northern 
Zaire, the area to which he was assigned was 
frequently plagued by measles epidemics, 
dehydration and malaria. As a Peace Corps 
volunteer, he was able to instruct the town of
50,000 how to deal with and prevent these and 
other health-related problems. With the help 
of Zairian medical personnel, Wright con
ducted classes to train volunteer health work
ers and produced a monthly informational 
health pamphlet in the native langauge of the 
area. Through projects such as these, Wright 
and his co-wojrkers not only reduced the 
mortality rate significantly, but also increased 
the towns immunization rate by five hundred 
percent.
Wright describes his years in Zaire as the 
most challenging thing that I have ever done. 
While serving as a Peace Corps volunteer he 
was able to learn two foreign languages and 
acquire invaluable experience as a profes
sional. Prior to serving as a Peace Corps 
volunteer, Wright had been enrolled in a 
managerial training position which he claims, 
did not allow meto take on any real responsi
bilities. His work with the Peace Corps 
sharply contrasted with this type of training in 
that within six months from his arrival in 
Zaire, Wright was co-directing a community 
health care project that had been nonexistent 
prior to his arrival.
Although serving as a Peace Corps volunteer 
involves a lot of difficult work, there is time
f
for entertainment. While in Zaire, Wright 
usually worked about 5 1/2 days per week. In 
his free time he often went to Zairian night
clubs where he soon acquired a taste for 
Zairian pop music and beer. Zairian beer is 
far better than any American beer, he claims. 
Peace Corps volunteers are also given 24 days 
of paid vacation during each year of service. 
Wright used these vacations to travel around 
other areas of Zaire.Are You Desperately Seeking a Superhero?

Back in my youth (which ended about an hour 
ago when I sat down to responsibly meet the

a secret vitamin ring and everything. Later, 
when I was oh, about six, I was Spiderman, 
who Im sure youll agree is more cerebral 
than Underdog and certainly not a fitting char
acter for a four-year-old to be. After that, I was 
Batman for a couple of years; then, around 
 when I turned ten, I was Captain Kirk. (This 
was when my mother realized that I was ma
ture for my age.) There followed a confused 
period when I wasnt sure if I was Gage from 
Emergency or Pete from The Mod Squad. 
I must have realized that I was in over my head 
(Pete from The Mod Squad, and only 
eleven!!) so I backed off and became Han
Experiences such as those that are described 
by Shawn Wright are looked upon favorably 
by both graduate schools and employers. 
Working in the Peace Corps promotes lan
gauge, cross cultural, and organizational 
skills. Many universities offer scholarships 
that are exclusively for former Peace Corps 
volunteers. Having served as a Peace Corps 
volunteer enables those that seek federal 
employment to be granted a noncompetitive 
eligibility status for a time after service. Such 
a standing is advantageous because it allows a 
former volunteer to be hired by federal agen
cies without competition from other appli
cants. Advancement is not limited to careers in 
the federal government. According to a report 
presented to a convention of the American 
Psychological Association on September 1, 
1987, former Peace Corps volunteers consis
tently outperform fellow workers in terms of 
salary gains and upward mobility.
In addition to the career advantages gained by 
serving as a Peace Corps volunteer, there are 
several monetary benefits. While serving in a 
host country, volunteers receive a living al
lowance, paid travel and training, and com
plete medical care. The living allowance pro
vided is large enough to take care of daily 
needs, entertainment, small arts and craft pur
chases, and small purchases related to the 
assignment. Peace Corps volunteers are also 
granted $175 for each month that is served. 
This money is presented in a lump sum at the 
end of the volunteers term of service. Serving 
in the Peace Corps also helps to ease the burden 
of paying back student loans. Through a new 
program, Peace Corps volunteers are able to
reduce the amount owed on National Direct 
Student Loans (NDSL) by between fifteen and 
twenty percent per year of service. This pro
gram applies only to NDSLs that were granted 
after July, 1987. Guaranteed Student Loans 
are deferred until six months after a Peace 
Corps volunteer completes his term of service.
The Peace Corps offers its volunteers numer
ous benefits both during and after their terms 
of service. Because there are approximately
20,000 applicants to the Peace Corps each year 
and about only 3,000 available positions, the 
Peace Corps must be rather selective when 
choosing volunteers. Applicants with skill in 
technical areas are especially in demand. 
Knowledge of a language such as French or 
Spanish is also helpful. Wright claims that 
applicants from Carnegie Mellon are gener
ally top notch. This month Denise Scobee, a 
1987 graduate with a BS in Electrical/Bi
omedical Engineering, will be leaving for the 
Fiji Islands for her assignment as a math 
teacher of high school and first year university 
students. John Martin Seitz, a 1987 graduate 
with a degree in Architecture is now working 
in New Guinea on a Public Health/Water 
Sanitation Program advising and training vil
lage leaders and initiating projects. Another 
Carnegie Mellon graduate, Edward A. Link, 
has recently left for Botswanata to assume a 
position teaching art to high school students.
Those interested in serving as a Peace Corps 
volunteer should apply nine to twelve months 
prior to availability to start training. More 
information about the Peace Corps may be 
obtained in the Career Services Center or by 
contacting Shawn Wright at 687-7424.

Were closing in on the present. I was Indi
ana Jones until about three years ago when I 
discovered the early James Bond movies. 
Thats when I became James Bond (the Con
nery Bond, never the Moore Bond, and only 
early Connery at that). Recently, I became 
Captain Kirk again with a vengeance. When 
dialing the telephone to talk to my sister (for 
example) Id say things like, Lieutenant 
Uhura, open a hailing frequency. When 
microwaving a frozen dinner, Id say, Scotty, 
I need more power!
All this is about to change, though. A change 
of superhero has been in the wind for me for a 
while now. I began to think about who my 
next alter ego should be. I briefly tested being 
the I Spy guys, but not enough people re
member this exellent television show. I 
thought a logical next choice would be Cap
tain Picard from the new Starship Enterprise, 
but first of all I have hair, and second of all 
when I tried being Picard, all I could make 
myself say was, Hey, crew, lets lounge 
around on this sofa and fly half-heartedly 
around the galaxy for a while, in a booming 
voice which disturbed the neighbors.
I finally decided on being the President of 
the United States. Why, itll be great. Every
thing I do will be controversial. Suppose, for 
instance, that I do something illegal. Why, 
heck, I can just pass the buck, and some other 
poor slob will be the scapegoat! (You may 
think Im referring to President Reagans 
habit of stealing candy bars. He has a two

How to Make a Million
While the work study program here at 
Carnegie Mellon is not designed to place 
students in the top ten net income percen
tile, there are other ways to make some 
extra money. With a little application, hard 
work and entrepreneurial talent a student 
could rival even the great Andrew Carne
gie in economic achievement. Although
By Sara Flynn
Andrew Carnegie had something of an ad
vantage being exempt from income tax and 
labor laws, todays entrepreneur should 
not be deterred.
The rewards and advantages of becoming 
a self-made man or woman are endless. 
Not only does it enable the entrepreneur to 
impress friends and acquaintances with his 
or her increased income, it also lends an 
aura or mystique to conversation. People 
will puzzle Where did Fred get His Vi
sion? as they sit in Scotland Yard, Fred 
just having picked up the check on his huge
Validine account. Of course Fred, the en
trepreneur, must refer to this Vision fre
quently in conversation. Especially when 
he finds himself with attractive single 
women.
The other day, as I was mulling over my 
history reading I realized that Mussoiini 
and I share many similar interests. Then 
as the girl sits agog Fred interjects a subtle 
reference to his vision. We share ideas in 
leadership, but I think Im a little bit more 
committed to my business. After all, Car
negie Mellon is simply a wasteland wait
ing to be developed by the right man.
Of course, Fred thinks of himself as The 
Right Man and while this may or may not 
be true, Carnegie Mellon is a community 
with a captive audience and an individual 
could take advantage of this. Everybody in 
this audience follows the same trends. It is 
this premise upon which Fred built his 
empire. Say he produced a laundry deter
gent which became very fashionable and 
all students found it necessary to use. If he 
marketed his Dirt-Out or WhiteyWhite not only would he become revered 
and respected he would also make quite a

A place to shmooz...Hang Out On Deck
BY EDDIE FLUSS
Special to the Tartan 
What would make Carnegie Mellon a better 
place? That was the question asked in a letter 
I received this summer from the administra
tion. I did not give it much thought then, but 
since my time at this institution is limited, I 
have started to think about what could have 
made my years at Carnegie Mellon better. 
Scenario 1:
Its Sunday morning and you wake with a 
yawn. You crack open your eyes to bright sun 
warming your face. You say to youself, Study? 
Today? No way! Im gonna lay out and catch 
some rays! But where you ask? A voice from 
the future whispers, The Deck.
Scenario 2:
Okay, so you need to study, but a bite of 
brunch in the sun with your sweetie would be 
just the right way to start that study day. But 
where? you ask. A voice from the future 
whispers, The Deck.
Imagine this: A large wooden deck, with 
lounge chairs, chaise lounges, picnic tables, 
umbrellas, etc. A place to shmooz (general 
term for all casual conversation) with friends 
before, between, or after classesan alterna
tive to Flagstaff. A place to soak up the sun in 
comfort with easy access to food and drink. It 
could even be fun without the sun. In the 
evening with those tacky red and green lan
tern-type lights, the Deck could be a great 
place to watch those nocturnal sports mid
night tennis and late night stock car races in 
the Morewood parking lot.
But whereshould the deck be located? Two 
perfect locations are atop the Morewood Cafe
teria and Rec room, or overlooking the tennis 
courts along the small hillside on one-tree 
hill. A deck would be relatively inexpensive 
to build and would be a great place to enjoy the 
weather all year. If skiers sun along a ski slope 
in Colorado, why not hang out on deck 
during the winter in Pittsburgh.
In the case of The Deck at Morewood, a set 
of stairs could be built along the side of the 
Morewood parking lot, thus providing easy 
and safe entry and exit. In the case of The 
Skibo/Court Deck, a big deck built out over
If skiers sun along a ski slope 
in Colorado, why not hang out 
on deck9 during the winter in 
Pittsburgh? .
the hillside would be a great spot for those 
Tartan picnics. Move an HB Quicks cart out 
onto the deck and in a jiffy youve got the next 
UDS hotspot, Picnic Plus.
As for problems facing such a project, there 
is, of course, the question of money and the 
chance that some student will try to fly off such 
a deck. A large rail and some signs saying DO 
NOT SIT ON THE RAIL should satisfy the 
insurance companies. As for the issue of 
money; well, money is a Cyert-type ques
tion.
If this idea is a flop so be it. I am an aged 
senior whose time has passed. I can only hope 
there is a freshman who can use this idea as a 
proposal for a Strategies paper.

CMU vs. Pitt: Food Fight!
By HOWDY PIERCE
Tartan Features Co-Editor
A guy I know says there are two things all 
Carnegie Mellon students have in com
mon: they dont talk English good and they 
complain about the food. Well, the English 
issue can be decided by a simple glance at 
CMUs median SAT verbal score, but the 
second point needed in-depth research. Is 
Carnegie Mellons food below par?
I thought a simple comparison was in 
order. So, on one sunny day last week, a 
non-partisan panel of culinary experts and 
I descended from the hills of Oakland into 
the land of easy grade point averages and 
low tuition to compare Pitts food with 
ours.
Pitt food is served in two cafeterias. The 
one we went to is located below a round 
housing structure known simply as Tower 
A. The name of the cafeteria is even sim
plerPitt students refer to it as the cafete
ria. Maybe it does have a real name, but 
every student that I asked, including the girl 
who takes meal cards, didnt know if there 
was any other name. The other cafeteria, 
for the curious, is called the other cafetena.
Before entering the actual cafeteria, you 
must first check all bookbags and purses 
with a guy who is wearing a blue shirt that 
says Pitt Checker on it. In return you 
receive a small piece of paper with a num
ber.
A Pitt lunch costs $3.10, which is cheaper 
than the $3.65 Kiltie charges. To buy a 
lunch (the meal-card-taker couldnt be
lieve we actually wanted to pay for them) 
you must go upstairs to the food contract 
office, where they will take your money 
and give you a meal ticket. Pitt students 
charge their meals on cards which are simi
lar to CMU dining cards. According to one 
Pitt freshman I talked with, Pitt meal plans 
come in 19,14, or 10 meals per week. There 
is no a la carte food and no validine. Even 
so, one Pitt student I talked to complained 
about the price of food for a semester.
After entering the cafeteria (which con
sists of handing your meal card to a girl with 
a shirt marked Pitt Checker), students 
proceed tovone of several cafeteria lines. 
There they get a salad, entree, and dessert. 
To get drinks, they go to a island in the 
middle of the cafeteria. Drinks come in two 
flavors: carbonated (like Coke or Sprite)
and milk. As far as we could tell, those are 
the only choices. (It was comforting to 
discover that Pitt serves its drinks in the 
same non-descript glasses found in Kiltie.)
The Pitt cafeteria is circular, containing a 
second circular wall in the center, making 
it doughnut-shaped. It has booths against 
both the inner and outer walls, as well as 
tables between. The floor is cafeteria-style 
tile, and the lightingperhaps in an at
tempt to escape the cafeteria feelis 
subdued and directional. There are no 
windows. The walls and ceiling are 
painted shades of blue, and plants are stra
tegically placed throughout the room. 
Nothing absorbs sound, and we felt the 
cafeteria was much louder than Kiltie.
After getting our food, we sat down at one 
of the four-person tables on molded fiber
glass chairs. On one side of us, a group of 
about seven Pitt students were playing 
cards; otherwise, most students were eat
ing alone or in pairs.
The food was good, but we felt it was 
noticeably poorer than Carnegie Mellons. 
Square pizza (as opposed to pizza-shaped 
pizza) was one of the choices on the day we 
went. Heather and Suethe other 
judgestold me it wasnt as good as 
MorePizza. I had a fish sandwich which 
was very similar to those served from time 
to time in Kiltie. It seemed to have been 
cooked about two hours before I arrived. A 
salad bar in the serving line offers about the 
same stuff as the Kiltie salad bar, with 
about the same quality. The most notice
able difference is in the desserts. Choices 
were extremely limited, and after one bite 
of my tired cherry pie I decided I was full. 
(After looking at the desserts, neither 
Heather nor Sue decided to risk it.)
We felt that there were several itemsat 
Pitt that would be nice to see at Kiltie. Al
though we did not try it, cereal is available 
in a great selection. And in addition to the 
hard ice cream found at Kiltie, Pitt pro
vides a soft ice cream machine.
How do Pitt students feel about their 
food? Its bad, one freshman told me. A 
junior agreed. Its the same processed 
food every daytheres no variety. Even 
the girl who takes the meal cards agreed. I 
live in an apartment and cook my own 
food, she told me. The stuff here gets old 
real quick.
I guess there isnt much difference.

bit of extra income.
A wonderful scheme, but who has the deter
gent making facilities readily available? Not 
many, but that shouldnt discourage the true 
professional thinker. After conducting exten
sive research throughout the community in an 
attempt to pinpoint the needs which a shrewd 
entrepreneur might serve, we came up with 
the following list:
1. Hair Spray for Pitt girls. If one hairspray 
were designated It/ the distributor could 
amass a fortune. Imagine all that hair craving 
your product... The riots in Oakland when the 
shopkeepers announce theyve run out of 
Extra Hold and Extra Body Spritz and 
Spray. It could be revolutionary.
2. Another product that would remain in 
constant demand: Beer Off removes the 
stickiness, the mess and the smell of old ale 
from walls, clothes, hands, floors, shoes, car
pets and breath. Enables socialization without 
the historical implications.
3. The Serf. An indentured servant that car
ries books, keys, ID cards, Mac disks, etc. The 
Serf does laundry, carries your tray in Kiltie,
and gets sodas, delivering them to you at your 
terminal, or desk.
Of course the plebian wants still abound 
around campus. The miscellaneous demands 
that arise could be serviced by a smart entre
preneur.
1. Correcting grammar, spelling, punctua
tion, sentence structure and content while 
typing papers.
2. Word adding or substitution. Replacing - 
words in papers and assignments with better, 
more effective and more apparently intellec
tual words. For example He looked at the 
shells replaced by He perused the crusta
ceans.
3. Delivering love letters. This job involves 
complex writing, reading, and footwork 
skills. The rewards are tremendous, but 
largely of a personal nature. The entrepreneur 
composes the love letter, writes it, and then 
drops it off to the victim. He or she then 
contacts the sender (the entrepreneur) and a 
date is made!
Go to it! Boost your earnings, increase your 
number of friends, get that lovelife into gear. 
As an entrepreneur, You Can Make A Million.

Is your idea of high fashion sleek styles 
straight from Paris gracing the covers of 
Vogue and GQ or dragging out your best pair 
of cords from the dirty laundry pile? Well, 
whether you go to your 8:30 class in your 
favorite Laura Ashley dress or in your 
iiDoy friends sweats, youre probably at least 
mildly interested in what clothing crazes are 
sweeping the nation. In an effort to keep your 
finger on the throbbing pulse of fashion (in 
Shady side anyway), I took to Walnut Street 
and asked merchants whats hot and whats 
not.
At Surrey (Bellefonte Place), Carol Hackett, 
buyer for the Young Contemporary section 
\<women aged 18 to 28), says the hottest thing 
this fall and winter is, of course, the miniskirt 
in materials such as leather and suede. Cotton 
twills and knits in dull, muted colors such as 
tobacco (similar to a burnt orange) are also in 
style. Baggy, cotton pull-on pants and cropped 
tops for an easy, slouchy look, says Hackett, 
are a very popular look with students because 
they're easy to take care of and comfortable. A 
i' ong shirt over a mini and a cropped top with 
long, baggy pants are trendy combinations. 
Leather bomber jackets also sold phenome
nally well.
As accessories, wooly, challis scarves, 
chunky earrings and opaque pantyhose in all 
colors are hot items. Hackett gives acid 
washed denim (which she sees as on the de
cline) the thumbs down. Asked to predict for 
J pring, Hackett thinks walking shorts in 
beautiful fabrics such as linen, silk, and 
poplin will be in.
Manager Maria Cutruczula at Benetton 
(5512 Walnut Street) agrees that minis and

Surreys latest fashions.
cropped sweaters are hot this season, espe
cially in muted colors like mustard and brown. 
The layered look, mixing cropped and over
sized shirts with baggy pants, is the way to go. 
To accessorize, use scarves, thick cummer
bund-like elastic belts, flats, printed socks, 
cotton tights, ankle boots, and slip on shoes. 
The Glen Plaid coat (with black and white 
plaid) and long, boxy coats are two best 
sellers. Long, wrap skirts and jackets long in 
the front and short in the back are becoming 
popular. For the spring line, Cutruczula sees 
off the shoulder shirts with the mini and 
smaller earrings as accessories.
At The Lodge at Harvard Square (5530 
Walnut Street), manager Cathleen Walker 
says that for men, acid washed jeans and 
jackets are still popularrThe two-piece Buga
boo jacket with its Buffalo check plaid, zip-in 
lining offers a sporty, casual look. This season
men prefer the more comfortable cotton 
sweaters over the itchy wool ones. A variety of 
T-shirts and sweatshirts with designs are still 
annual favorites. Suspenders are hot accesories.
Women are wearing minis in red and green 
Tartan plaid, as well as denim with boxy, 
cropped sweaters and oversize sweat shirts in 
Canton cotton. Baggy pants feature a paper 
bag waistcinched-in and gathered at the 
top, getting fuller at the bottom. Hot accesso
ries include small handbags, scarves, big bar
rettes, pins, and earrings. Leather boots in 
different styles are still extremely popular.
For those who prefer an alternative to main
stream fashion trends, The Vamp (5437 Wal
nut Street) offers wearable rarities, featur
ing 60s evening wear, cashmere overcoats, 
and rhinestone jewelry.
For you swashbuckling, adventurous types, 
Banana Republic (5534 Walnut Street) has a 
wide variety of safari and travel clothing. If 
youre looking for something khaki or some
thing that looks like Indiana Jones might wear 
it, youll find it here.
Now that you have the fashion update and a 
few predictions for spring, you can can amaze 
your friends and family with your new found 
fashion expertise.

Society for Creative Anachronism Re-Creates Other Ages
BY BRIAN THOMAS SCHMIDT
Tartan Staffwriter 
Of all the clubs active at CMU, one of the 
most unique and curious is The Society for 
Creative Anachronism (SCA). According to 
its charter, SCA is an international, non
profit, educational, social, and recreational 
organization devoted to the re-creation of the 
{lifestyle, arts, crafts, and occupations of the 
medieval period. Its aim is to re-enact the 
Middle Ages as they should have been, 
centering mainly on pre- 17th century Western 
Europe, but other times (up to roughly 1650) 
and cultures (Japanese, Cavaliers, Incan, Afri
can, etc.) are also represented. Members de
vise their own characters and personas that are 
much like people who would have lived during 
{ the times of the culture they wish to represent, 
taking these on as their identity during club 
activities and doing things these people would 
have done.
The initial impression is one of a very strange 
activity and peopleand in a way, this is true.
The members of 
SCA have some 
different hobbies 
and interests, 
which is part of 
the reason why 
they join. It gives 
them the oppor
tunity to be in
volved with oth
ers who have 
similar interests.
We get all 
kinds of people, 
says club presi
dent Cindy Con
nelly, Everything from lawyers and ac
countants to machinists, and, of course, 
students. Most of our students are science 
majors, Connelly says. Members range in 
age from 6 months to 70, but in the Pittsburgh 
area chapter, they average between 20 and 35.
What is it about this club that turns these
SOCIETY FOR 
CREATIVE 
ANACHRONISM
people on? The 
20th century is a 
nice place to live, 
but it's boring to 
visit, explains 
Connelly. SCA 
is a good way to 
combine your in
terests with some 
good old-fash
ioned escapism 
and its cheaper 
than drugs, and 
legal, too. Its also 
a real friendly 
group. I think 
thats an attraction for a lot of students. Theres 
a real sense of community. For CMU students 
this is especially convenient because many of 
the clubs local activities take place on the 
CMU campus. Anyone who is interested is 
welcome to come hang out, watch us practice, 
and ask questions, she said.
Such practices are a big part of the clubs 
activities . Members practice fighting, danc
ing, and many other activities. We practice 
fighting because you have to be authorized by 
our fighting marshalls (referees) to compete in 
a toumey, Connelly explains. The fights in
volve the use of armor and weapons made out 
of rattan or fencing foils. Dancers rehearse by 
running through all the moves carefully before 
trying them out.
The clubs regular weekly meetings to prac
tice its various activities are a good place for 
outsiders to find out what the group is all 
about. The best place to find us is to come to 
our fighting practices. Currently, were hold
ing practices in the gymnasium in Thistle 
Hall. Joint general meetings involving 
groups from Pitt, CMU, and other area col
leges are held in room 225C Baker Hall, the 
second Wednesday of every month. If you are 
interested in finding out more about the group, 
feel free to attend one of these meetings or 
contact Connelly at 687-5808.

probably had a problem with her rotator cuff. 
He said that if she strained the muscle during 
play, it might rip. Fibus played her match 
anyway. Luckily, however, from the way 
Fibus was able to dominate play during her 
uoubles, it was hard to tell that she was injured.
Fibus and Boyds semifinal match was 
against New York Universitys Nicole LaGrange and Patty Walsh. The Lady Tartans 
dominated the first set through an incredible 
attacking game by both players followed by 
crisp high volleys. After losing the first set, the 
Violettes saw that they would need a change in 
strategy. They replied with one high lob after 
another. This forced Fibus and Boyd back to 
the base line which took away their net court 
advantage. NYU almost won the second set 
but the Tartans held tough and took the set to 
a tie-breaker. Before LaGrange and Walsh 
even knew the tie-breaker had begun, Carne
gie Mellon had already taken the first four 
points. The early points went swiftly, and 
Boyd was everywhere. Any ball even hit close 
.o her was sent rocketing back for a winner. In 
the end the pair only lost one point in the entire 
tie-breaker. The set ended, 6-3, 7-6 (7-1).
This win earned the team a chance at the 
finals where they faced Brandeiss Noriko 
Kuge and Jill Goldhand. Throughout the 
tournament Brandeis University had domi
nated doubles play: as a result they appeared in 
all three of the doubles championships. Fibus 
ind Boyd jumped out to an early lead which 
they kept for the rest of the match. Only once 
near the end of the second set did they waver. 
All of a sudden when the team began to realize 
that they were on the verge of winning, they 
forgot to continue playing the aggressive 
game that had got them to the finals. This 
allowed Brandeis to make one last attempt at 
getting back in the match. The Tartans rejrouped and finished Brandeis off, and thus, 
won the tournament at #3 doubles. The final 
score was, 6-4, 7-5.
This was the only number one finish for the 
Tartans. However, sophomore Beth Cava
naugh (#2), graduating senior Captain Andrea 
Benowitz (#3), senior Amy Fibus (#4), and 
Tracy Boyd (#5) did finish in fourth for their 
positions. All in all the women played a good
lumament, but in clutch situations the teams 
relative inexperience as compared to the other 
teams showed through. Of all the teams pres
ent Carnegie Mellon competes in the easiest 
conference, they have just about the worst 
tennis facilities, and they practice less than 
most of the other teams due to the amount of 
rain and the lack of access to indoor courts. 
Time after time the women played as well as 
( hey have played all season only to be denied 
the win by their more experienced opponents. 
I wish we could have had this caliber of 
competition all season long. Better competi
tion would have better prepared us for this 
tournament, commented Cavanaugh.
After the first day of competition the Lady 
Tartans were in fourth place. The Lady Tar
tans fared much better the first day than was 
Axpected. They won 4 out of their singles 
matches and 1 out of their 3 doubles matches. 
At #3 singles, team captain Benowitz, playing 
in her last collegiate tournament, convincingly 
destroyed her Case Western opponent in a 6-0, 
6-0 match. I let her make all the mistakes, 
Benowitz explained, She was very erratic. I 
was going to the net and I got all of my points 
there. 1 was so happy.
QOn the other hand, Tracy Boyd had an ex
tremely difficult first match as she played 
against Washington Universitys Susan 
Frankel. She won the warm up, which made 
me nervous. She was pounding them, but 1 
won the game! Boyd explained after the 
match. Boyd took the first set without any real 
problem, only to find herself in trouble in the

second set 5-5. Boyd broke serve making the 
score 6-5. On the changeover as Frankel hit 
the balls over to Boyd, she hit a lob that landed 
squarely in the middle of Boyds head, result
ing in a thud that could be heard across the 
courts. After the match Boyd explained, 
That girl had the best serve that I have ever 
seen. She is better than anyone I have played 
this season. She hit me on the head and I still 
beat her. 1 was really centered on this match.
At #1 doubles, Dottor and Cavanaugh just 
couldnt get their game together. It wasnt 
until they were down 4-1 before they realized 
they needed to get in the set. They did salvage 
two more games, only to lose the set 6-3. They 
did start out strong in the second set and 
jumped out to a large 3-0 lead. Inconsistency 
problems began to plague the tandem and all of 
a sudden the score was 5-6. At 2-3 in the game 
the team won a point that seemed to have 
lasted most of the afternoon. However, they 
lost the next point, and thus, the set. They lost 
the match 6-3,7-5. The team ended up in fifth 
for the tournament after the three days of 
competition.

nament. They beat just about anyone who 
walked on the court with them. They usually 
did not take too much time in their effort, 
either. The #2 doubles team of Benowitz and 
Alice Garber faced Emory in the first round. 
The gate had barely swung shut before Emory 
had made short work of the team. Garber com
mented, We were outplayed, over-played, 
and under-played, but we had fun. We were 
slaughtered. They wiped us all over the court. 
All we could do is laugh, stated Garber. You 
just couldn t lose one point to these girls. They
were too good, affirmed Benowitz.
CMU began to have difficulties on the sec 
ond day as they started to play some of the 
better players in the U A A. It was apparent tha 
the Lady Tartans were not used to seeing thi; 
many good opponents in one event. We die 
not lose this tournament, Coach Dave Licht 
man explained, we were beaten by bettei 
experienced national teams. Fifth place is a 
good finish for our team. All our players are 
coming back as much better tennis competi
tors. This was a valuable experience.

X-Country Wins PAC...Again
3y RICH SHIPLEY
"artan Staffer iter
Coach Gary Meckley has yet another trophy 
o add to his rather large collection. The mens 
ross-country team won the PAC championhip again this year at Hiram. The Tartans had 
* total of 22 points, and were trailed by a 
iistant Grove City team with 56. Along with 
he PAC Championship, Meckley won Coach 
>f the Year honors for the PAC.
The only thing the Tartans did not capture 
vas the individual championship, which was 
aken by Hirams Dave Taylor. His winning 
ime was 24:59, a very excellent run by the 
potential All-American. The next four places 
vere all claimed by the Tartans as Keith 
itopen finished second with a time of 25:02.
He was followed by Dave Supp, 25:04, Pat 
Noll, 25:43, and Paul Camine. Carnegie 
Mellons Gary Harrison came in 8th overall, 
while Louie Czak rounded off the Tartan top 
six. Len ONeil was taken to the meet, but did 
not run due to illness. Everyone will be jn top 
shape for the NCAA regionals on November 
14th.
The race was run very strong and consis
tently from start to finish. As a result, Meckley 
was very happy with the individual perform
ances and is looking forward to a strong show
ing at the regionals and hopefully the nation
als. The first mile was run in 4:31, and fol
lowed by a time of 9:34 at the two-mile 
marker. They finished out the race with con
sistent 5-minute miles.

ing points to pull the Lady Tartans to a 12-7 
lead.
However, after the first big climb up, came 
the first drop. The Lady Spartans reeled off 
five straight points to even the game, and Case 
went on to win, 15-13.
Next, it was time for the Lady Tartans to go 
back up. Behind the seven straight serving 
points of captain Zalevsky, Carnegie Mellon 
stormed back to a 15-9 victory in the second 
game of the best of three match.
The rubber game was another close affair, 
but the Lady Spartans pulled out a 15-11 
decision. The Lady Tartans hadnt seen any of 
their UAA opponents before, but Case had 
played several common opponents, most re
cently, Thiel College. We knew Thiel beat 
Case, we took them for granted, remarked 
Kristine Loh.
The next portion of Carnegie Mellons ride 
was against the third-seeded New York Uni
versity Violettes. NYU had also lost its 
opener, 15-10,15-3 to second-seeded Roches
ter. The Tartan Coaster was onto riding its 
next crest.
The first game started with a whole new team 
in Carnegie Mellon red and white. The Lady 
Tartans took the first game, 15-8. The second 
game was never in doubt, Carnegie Mellon 
jumped out to a commanding 10-0 lead over 
the Violettes, winning 15-5.
NYU Head Coach Cindy McGuire was at a 
loss for words after her teams second loss. 
Theres a missing piece. Its the same people, 
same team, maybe its the airplane ride, maybe 
theyre nervous. Weve beaten teams that are 
better than weve seen today.
Watson offered another explanation, After 
we made a mistake, we didnt make another. 
Tartan Coach Sue Flaherty added, (it was) 
communication, team work, basic skills. 
Everyone was anxious early.
The next morning, the Lady Tartans played 
their final preliminary game. Facing them 
were the second-seeded Rochester Yellowjackets. The Yellowjackets had won both
games on Friday, and they were ready to knock 
Carnegie Mellon for a loop-the-loop.
The Lady Tartans were no match for Roches
ter, who was ranked fourth in the cont 
iivision III Northeast region. Led by captain 
Heide Balfe and junior middle hitter Diane 
Ulatowski, the Yellowjackets rolled over 
Carnegie Mellon, 15-6, 15-2.
Rochester Head Coach Bob Brewington felt 
the Lady Tartans looked lost in their match. 
In the second game, they looked like they 
were getting steam-rollered, they just gave up 
We started rolling, we played more confi
dently.
The opening games were used to seed the 
eight squads for single-elimination play. The 
Lady Tartans were seeded second from Pool B 
behind Rochester which had won all three of 
its matches, but ahead of NYU and Case.
Carnegie Mellons first elimination match 
came against the University of Chicago Ma
roons. Back the Lady Tartans went, to climb 
the final hill.
Chicago was never in the first game against 
a more intense Carnegie Mellon six. Good net 
play by McCandless and freshman middle 
hitter Nicole Hanak helped build a 4-1 lead 
which quickly ballooned to 14-3.
The Lady Tartans went on to win the opener 
15-6 and took the second game, 15-9.
The final plunge came against the hosting 
Washington Bears. The top-seeded, and na
tionally ranked, Bears had already mowed 
down Brandeis, Emory, Chicago, and Case 
Western.
Carnegie Mellon took the first point, but th 
disciplined Washington squad was simply 
better. The Bears quickly won the first game, 
15-4.
In the second game it was no different. 
Washington won that game, 15-7.
For Washingtons Head Coach Ten Cle
mens, it was her 99th victory in only three 
years as the Bears Coach. She got her 100th 
in the championship when the Bears defeated 
Rochesters Yellowjackets for the fourth time 
this season, 15-10,15-7,15-9.
Coach Flaherty seemed pleased with the Tar
tans third place finish in the tournament. I 
thought we did really well, she remarked. 
Captain Zalevsky agreed, It was our best year 
since my freshman year.
Yet, problems still exist. The Lady Tartans 
play largely cm emotion. Said Flaherty, Its a 
lack of self-confidence, we mostly had to work 
on techniques and basic skills this year. They 
were playing basic volleyball.
Flaherty did point out the play of two of her 
seniors. Of Marianne Smith she noted, She 
(Smith) did a real nice job, shes real depend
able at any point in the game. Zalevsky drew 
these comments, Shes a really good leader, 
we could play without her, but not as well.
That though, is exactly what Carnegie Mel
lon will have to do next season. The Lady 
Tartans did that early this year when Zalevsky 
went down with an ankle injury. Then, the 
leadership role was taken over by Watson, 
who will again have to take that role next year.
Im going to do a lot of recruiting this fall, 
acknowledges Flaherty, the team is going to 
look a lot different next year. Despite this, the 
first-year coach seems optimistic with regards 
to the future. Since we finished third this year 
(in the UAA), we have to hope for a higher 
record next year. In the PAC (Presidents 
Athletic Conference), I cant see us coming 
any lower than second.
The Lady Tartans finish their season this 
week with a match against Hiram tonight as 
7:00 in the Skibo Gym. Their final road trip 
will be Thursday to Bethany for matches 
against Bethany and Robert Morris.

Rugby Routs Allegheny
By DAVID BRILL
Tartan Assistant Sports Editor
In the Rugby teams best performance of the 
season, with all facets of their game clicking, 
the squad beat Allegheny 46-0 on the Intamural field Saturday. From the opening kickoff, 
.vhen Carnegie Mellons Mike Kleha picked 
up a blocked punt and ran it in, the ruggers 
knew they were in control. This was the first of 
three tries scored by Kleha on the day. As the 
Allegheny defense then tried to close up the 
running lanes, CMU exploded with one try 
scored by Eric Hoffman on a blistering run. 
Other scorers included two tries by Pat Flynn, 
and one try apiece by John Ward, Dom Ianno, 
Joe Villarreal and Pete Wolcott.
The success of the A team rubbed off on the 
B team who posted their first shutout in a 15- 
0 romp. Strong running was the key to victory, 
as an impressive game by the backs provided 
the first try when John Lucena put the ball in 
the try zone. The two other tries in the game 
were the cause of strong scrums, who on these 
two occasions pushed the ball into the try zone. 
The scrum also played strong defense by 
winning a decisive majority of the put-ins and

seemingly accelerating instantaneously out of 
the backfield. His partner in the backfield, 
Rick France, helped some, but it was mostly 
Pagano (30 att., 166 yards) and QB Aigner 
(15-28,219 yards) who led the W&J offense.
, The Presidents scored on their first two pos
sessions of the first half, narrowing the Tartan 
lead to 22-20. CMU struck back after the 
second, with Hensel hitting tight end Tim 
Kelly for a big 52 yard pass to put the ball at the 
15 yard line. 6 plays later, it was 29-20.
What killed the Tartans were two more W&J 
touchdowns in the span of 1:08 early in the 
fourth quarter. Aigner hit Pagano for 57 yards 
~n the first play for a TD, then took advantage 
of a key Hensel fumble on his own 13 yard line 
for another quick score.
Suddenly, there were less than 5 minutes left 
and Carnegie Mellon trailed 35-29. A Gerry 
Bosch interception gave the Tartans the ball 
on their own 46, and they did what they knew 
best: run the ball. Helsel carried the ball in to 
the end zone himself for the touchdown and 
"5-35 lead with only 43 seconds remaining. 
Then the Presidents made their final come
back.
Hensel and Hansen were again the Tartan 
offensive leaders. Hansen led Tartan rushers 
with 103 yards and 2 TDs, followed by 
Hensel's41. Hensel also threw for an even 200 
yards. A lot of the credit for their success goes 
to the Tartan offensive line, which effectively 
-eutralized W&J defensive threats Jim Meyer 
and Marie Kern. The line also didn't allow a 
sack.
The only real losers were the Carnegie Mel
lon fans who stayed away in droves. Washing
ton and Jefferson fans controlled the stands, 
almost negating the CMU home field advan
tage. Despite the perfect weather and bitter 
rivalry between the two teams, most Carnegie 
* lellon students seemed to be in the computer 
clusters instead.
Bits n Pieces: Jim Kelly's 22 yard field goal 
marked the first time the Tartans have scored 
in the first quarter this year...A.J. Pagano's 166 
rushing yards put him over the 1000 mark for 
the season. He is also third in all-time Division 
III scoring...Mike Hensel also acheived a 
milestone Saturday, topping 4000career pass

With the win, the ruggers move to 5-1 in the 
fall season, and play their last game Saturday

second half, senior co-captain Kevin Jung 
took a Park pass and converted it for the 
Tartans second goal. Bethany tied the score, 
and regulation ended with a 2-2 tie.
But the Tartans attack, as well as their de
fense, collapsed in overtime, and Bethany 
scored four times to hand the Tartans their 
seventh loss of the season to go with seven 
wins and two ties.
The Tartans will look to finish a disappoint
ing and injury-filled season above the .500 
mark, as they travel to take on St. Vincent

Field Hockey Third In UAA
By SHAFI KHAN
Tartan Staffwriter
The CMU field hockey team fell short of 
winning the Presidents Athletic Confer
ence by one goal. They lost a tough one to 
Bethany 1-0 at Tech Field and ended up 
second in the PAC with a 4-2 record. Hiram 
claimed the division by a point, sporting a 
4-1-1 record. Overall, the teams final 
record was 5-6-1.
Although Bethany controlled the ball 
early, CMU had numerous opportunities to 
score but failed to capitalize on their drives. 
With about 20 minutes left into the half, 
Bethany scored on a grass-screaming line 
drive that eluded goalie Andi Trump to put 
them up 1-0. A few seconds later, CMU 
missed their best chance to score when 
forward Maya Sternberg had a breakaway 
but her shot was blocked by the goalie.
They missed on another fine drive when a 
Vandermeer shot from the far left just went 
wide of the net.
CMU put on continuous pressure in the 
second half also but couldnt register a 
single goal. Midway through the half,
Maya Sternberg took a comer pass and sent 
a shot wide to the right. Late in the game 
Bethany had a two-on-two breakaway but 
sweeper Hetal Nanavati cleared the ball 
away before Bethany had a chance to 
shoot. CMU missed on its last drive in the 
game when Sheila Bomberger took a shot 
off a Fay comer, but it was blocked away by 
the goalie.
The team traveled to Johns Hopkins, 
where they competed in the UAA Champi
onships. Unfortunately they lost big in both 
games, losing to University of Rochester 4- 
0 and Johns Hopkins 7-0. The scores; 
however, do not tell the whole story. They 
played on artificial turf which they werent 
used to. The team had a total of two hours 
practice on the turf before the game which 
didnt give them much time to soak up the 
experience needed to play on that kind of 
surface. They played with the Yellowjack
ets in terms of pace, but Rochester just took 
advantage of the turf and dominated on the 
accurate, short passing and ball movement. 
U. of Rochester ended up beating Johns 
Hopkins to win the UAA.

Mark Mittlehauser: PHI Player of the Game

The Tartans congratulate Mark Mittlehauser (26) on his interception against W&J.
By PERRY PIERCE
Tartan Staff\\'riter
When a team loses a second team All-American to injury, it usually begins to worry. But 
that has not been the case at Carnegie Mellon 
in 1987, freshman comerback Mark Mittelhauser has filled in for Billy Cramer in great 
style. Mittelhausers play last Saturday 
against the Presidents was no short of excel
lent, and earned him Panther Hollow Inn [PHI] 
player of the game honors.
The 59", 168 lb. freshman from nearby Indi
ana, Penn, started out his career as a safety. 
When he made the move from Indiana High to 
CMU, the coaching staff moved him to comerback. Mittelhauser was placed behind second 
team All-American Billy Cramer to start the 
season, and did not expect to see much playing 
time this season. But Cramers season has 
been cut short by a broken arm, which has 
thrust the freshman into a very pressure 
packed role. Billy [Cramer] was so intense 
out there, commented Mittelhauser. I have 
never seen anyone want to play the game as 
much as he did. But he taught me a lot in a very 
short time.
Against Washington and Jefferson this past 
week, the Tartans knew they were facing the 
nations second best Division III squad. We 
all knew they were the number two team in the 
country, but the coaches told us that if we 
stayed within striking distance throughout the 
game, we had a decent shot at winning the 
game.
The coaching staff reviewed films of W&J 
contests all season, and had their game plan 
figured out. We were very well prepared by 
the coaches this week. We saw a lot of v. hat 
they talked about in the films. When we got 
out on the field, we felt we could stop them 
cold.
As game time approached, the whole team 
was on edge despite being so well prepared.
Mittelhauser said that he had never been 
more nervous for a game. But right away, the 
Tartans assumed control and had the Presi
dents on the ropes.
In the second quarter, W&J was driving, and 
worked themselves all the way inside the 
Tartan 20 yard line. Then came the key play in 
the half, which earned Mittelhauser PHI 
player of the game honors. President quarter
back Pat Aigner was looking for a touchdown 
on a second and goal from the Tartan seven 
yard line, and called for a pass right at 
Mittelhausers man. Aigner dropped back, 
and the receiver took a step out, then slanted 
inside. I just followed the receiver in, and saw 
the pass coming my way. I just tried to step 
inside and block the pass, but I was able to get 
in front and got the interception.
The interception stopped a key drive for the 
Presidents who were down 10-7 at the time.
Mittelhausers play keyed a Tartan offensive 
surge after the pickoff that culminated in the 
Tartans scoring on a 55 yard pass from Mike 
Hensel to Dean Garofola.
Mittelhausers play on the comer in this 
game was excellent, as the Presidents stayed 
away from his region of the field constantly. I 
didnt have a great game last week, and I 
thought that W&J would key on me based on 
the films.
The Tartan strong comer also had high praise 
for the offense in the game, as he believed they 
played their best game all year. But the bottom 
line is that the Presidents kicked the winning 
field goal with only eight ticks left on the 
clock. When we scored with 49 seconds left, 
we thought we may have given them too much 
time. On the first play that W&J ran, they 
gained 35 yards and we knew that the game 
was far from over.

TOP MANAGERS NAMED
In somewhat of a surprise, the Mon
treal Expos Buck Rodgers and Detroits 
Sparky Anderson were named managers 
of the year. Rodgers was also named 
National League manager of the year 
last year. San Fransiscos Roger Craig 
finished second in the National League 
voting ahead of St. Louis Whitey Her
zog. In the American League voting, 
Tom Kelly of the Minnesota Twins, the 
players choice for manager of the year, 
finished third. "
STEELERS SIGN TOP PICK
The Pittsburgh Steelers signed their 
number one draft choice, Ron Woodson 
of Purdue, to a four-year, $2.2 million 
contract. The world-class hurdler has 
started practicing with the club and 
hopes to be in game condition within a 
month. v
DICKERSON TRADED
The Los Angeles Rams have traded 
Eric Dickerson to the Indianapolis 
Colts. Dickerson, one of the NFLs 
leading rushers every season, was very 
unhappy with the clubs offense. He 
also complained about being underpaid, 
and when the Rams refused to renegotiate his contract, he requested the trade.
In the three-way trade with the Colts and 
Buffalo, the Rams acquired two mnning 
backs and six high draft picks over the 
next two years. The Bills received Cor
nelius Bennett, the #2 draft pick this 
year, for their participation in the deal.
#8 GATEWAY LOSES
Gateway High School in Monroeville 
was one of the top ranked High School 
teams in the country until last week. 
Gateway was ranked ninth in the poll 
going into their game against Woodland 
Hills two weeks ago, but could not come 
out with a win. The 27-21 loss dropped 
Gateway out of the number three in the 
Pennsylvania polls, and third in the na- r 
tion. And last weekend Gateway was 
upset by Central Catholic High School. 
Gateways arch rival, North Hills High 
School, is currently ranked number one 
in the country, and preserved that rank
ing with a 14-0 blanking of Mt. Lebanon 
this past weekend.
SOVIETS NETTED BY BUCKS
The Milwaukee Bucks beat the Soviet 
National basketball team 127-100 this 
past week. The Bucks were playing 
without their top four guards, and had 
only been practicing together for two 
weeks before the game. This game was 
also a big blow to people around the 
world that have wanted to see NBA 
players play in the Olympics. This game 
was just a trial run, and the feeling is that 
the Soviet team is probably the best 
amateur team in the world.
WASH. U. WINS UAA SOCCER
With a 3-0 victory over Emory at 
Francis Field in St. Louis, the Washing
ton University Bears clinched the first 
ever University Athletic Association 
Mens Soccer Title. The Bears are 
ranked ninth in the nation and are look
ing for a birth in the NCAA Playoffs.
The victory was one of two UAA titles 
that Washington clinched at home that 
Saturday as the Volleyball Bears won 
the UAA Volleyball title.

IM Football Finals
Crunch Bunch, The Squad, 
And Pika Take IM Titles
By STEWART LEVINE
Tartan Sports Editor
The King is dead! Long live the King!
Monday night, the long time rules of intra
mural major league football finally fell. A 32- 
6 victory over Pika-A gave Crunch Bunch its 
first majors title.
Crunch Bunch got all the points it would 
need on its first drive. An excellent kickoff 
return by John Murray allowed Crunch Bunch 
to punch the ball in two plays later, taking a 7- 
Olead.
Pika closed the gap on their first series, a long 
bomb put them on the.board, but the missed 
point after left them behind 7-6. They would 
never catch up.
Two Rob Bowie bootlegs pushed the lead to 
20-6 by the end of the first half. Two more 
series in the second half made the final, 32-6.
According to Crunch Bunchs Brad Taylor, 
the two teams earlier meeting helped to make 
the difference. We found the defense against 
them in the last half of the first game, he 
noted.
The intermediate final almost never was 
played. A protest by Easy Money over the
eligibility of one The Squads player forced a 
postponement of the match until Tuesday.
When the match finally was played, The 
Squad defeated the ECE Dynamic Rams, 19- 
13. ECE got on the board first with an early 
strike in the first quarter to take a 6-0 lead. At 
that point though, The Squad took over, to roll 
to their 19-13.
In the minors final, earlier Monday night, 
Pika-C defeated the ECE (Minors) Dynamic 
Rams, 20-7.
ECE had a high-scoring offense that had 
scored points by the bushel all season long, but 
the stiff Pika defense shut the Rams down.
While ECE tried for the quick score, Pika 
was content to play a short yardage game of 
runs and screen passes. Their methodical play 
garnered Pika a 7-0 halftime lead.
Pika put the pressure on in the second half, a 
long touchdown pass early in the second half 
followed by an interception on an ECE shovel 
pass pushed Pikas lead to 20-0 before ECE 
could finally get on the board.
Pikas Eric Friedman claimed his team 
sewed up the game at the start They fell 
behind quickly and had to go for the big play."

Presidents Reelected On Late Ballot

Fullback Chris Hansen (32) bulls his way through the Presidents defense during the 
Tartans loss on Saturday.
By JOHN FRIEDMANN
Tartan Contributing Editor 
On paper, it looked like a mismatch.
The Washington and Jefferson Presidents, 
Division Ills #2 ranked team, held the advan
tage in size, weight, scoring, defense, and 
depth. The only cards in Carnegie Mellons 
hand were a quarterback looking to regain his 
1985 form, a lot of freshmen and sophomores, 
Tech Field and emotion. A President win 
would just be another step on the way to the 
playoffs; for the Tartans it was rest of the sea
son.
It looked like a mismatch at halftime. But it 
was the Tartans who were dealing the cards 
with a 22-7 lead.
And if not for a desperate W&J drive in the 
last 43 seconds of the contest, it would have 
been Carnegie Mellon who emerged victori
ous. The Tartans had just taken a 36-35 lead on 
an improbable drive of their own, and just had 
to hold the Presidents for less than a minute. 
But quarterback Pat Aigner completed a pass 
to star running back A J. Pagano, who dodged 
and darted 34 yards to the CMU 36 yard line. 
As time ran out, freshman John Ivory booted a 
40 yard field goal to give the Presidents a 38- 
36 win.
Irregardless of the winner, it was one of the 
greatest football games ever played at Tech 
Field. The contest featured everything that 
makes football great: sparkling offense, gutty 
defense, and exciting comebacks.
Jim Kelly's first quarter field goal gave the 
Tartans an early 3-0, lead, but the emotional 
tempo was set by Rob Arthur's fumble recov
ery that set up the drive.
The emotional balance flip-flopped as soon 
as W&J got the ball again. A fired-up Tartan 
defense seemed to have the Presidents stalled,

ATLANTA-This weekend the Carnegie 
Mellon Womens Tennis team flew to Emory 
University in Atlanta to compete in the first 
annual University Athletic Conference Cham
pionship (UAA). The Lady Tartans finished 
in fifth place among eight schools with one 
first place finish and four fourth place finishes.
With the exception of one match between the 
University of Chicago and New York Univer
sity which was not over when the team left for 
the airport, the final scores were Emory 42, 
Brandeis 36, University of Chicago 24, WashBy STEWART LEVINE

ST. LOUIS-Pittsburghs Kennywood Park 
calls itself the Roller Coaster Capital of the 
World. The park is closed for the winter, but 
Pittsburgh has a new source for thrilling highs 
and chilling falls: the Carnegie Mellon Vol
leyball Team. As senior Karin McCandless 
put it, Thats how we are, up and down, up 
and down, up and down.
This past weekend at the University Athletic 
Association (UAA) Championships, the 
sixth-seeded Lady Tartans ride netted them a
forcing coach John Luckhardt to call for a 51 - 
yard field goal attempt.
The attempt was blocked, but CMU was 
dealt a devasting blow: too many men on the 
field. The resultant 15 yards and first down set 
up a TD and 7-3 J lead.
The shocking part of the game came next as 
Carnegie Mellon reeled off 19 unanswered 
second-quarter points. Chris Hansen, Bill 
Heiser and Boomer Schmitt ran straight at the 
W&J line, that despite averaging 6'2", 252 
pounds was being beat off the ball by the petite 
6'0", 227 pound CMU offensive front. 
Hansens 2 yard run and Kelly's PAT put Tech 
in front 10-7.
The Presidents seemed determined to get 
that touchdown back. Quarterback Pat Aigner, 
who passed for 219 yards on the day, mixed 
passes with Pagano rushes effectively enough 
to get to the Tartan 7.
Aigners next pass was one too many, as 
freshman Mark Mittlehauser took the first step 
towards PHI player of the game honors with a 
goal-line interception. Mittlehauser, a comerback, was moved into the lineup because of the 
injury to all-conference defensive back Bill 
Cramer.
Although they didn't expect to be back on the 
field so soon, the CMU offense wasted no time 
in getting to work. Mike Hensel pulled himself 
out of a second down and 14 hole with a 12 
yard pass to Mike Beresford. On the next play, 
he sucked the defense in, then lofted a pass to 
the all-alone Dean Garofola, who romped 55 
yards for another Tartan TD. Kelly's point 
after was no good, and the score stayed 16-7.
The Tartans' final score of the half came 
when defensive tackle Bill Kerr recovered an 
Aigner fumble. Hensel's four yard loop to tight 
end Gary Gojsovich made the score 22-9 at
ington University 21, Carnegie Mellon 19, 
University of Rochester 16, New York Uni
versity 12, and Case Western 1.
The big story; however, came from the #3 
doubles team of Tracy Ace Boyd and Amy 
Fibus. This same team that found themselves 
in the middle of all the disappointment over 
the close Presidents Athletic Conference 
(PAC) Championship loss surprised all and 
finished in first place at #3 doubles.
On the first day of competition, Boyd and 
Fibus pulled out an impressive win against the 
University of Rochester. After the match they 
commented, We totally took control. We
a tie for third place in the conference.
The Tartan Coaster left for St. Louis climb
ing, with a 3-0 victory over Presidents Ath
letic Conference rival Thiel on Tuesday (15-9, 
15-9,15-8). Both teams battled inconsistency 
and fatigue throughout the match; however, 
Carnegie Mellons movement on the court and 
quicker offense allowed the Lady Tartans to 
capitalize on Thiel miscues. Senior Monica 
Zalevsky and freshman Nicole Hanak ignited 
Carnegie Mellons offense, combining for 26 
of the teams 46 kills in the match. The quick 
set offense used by the Lady Tartans caught
halftime.
The dream began to crumble in the final 30 
minutes. Offensive coordinator Rich Erdelyi 
told the Tartans they needed to score two more 
touchdowns to win. That they did. But it was 
the defense that let the Presidents score on five 
of their seven second half possessions. Inju
ries played a part, as both Bill Kerr and AllAmerica lineman Brian Roessler were lost for
were invincible. We returned well. We served 
well. We started playing well, but all of a 
sudden they started to play better so we just 
had to play even better still and we did!  Fibus, 
who is never very far from a pack of Oreo 
Cookies insisted, It was my Oreos that did it. 
The tandem defeated their opponents, 6-1,6-
4.
For the last several weeks, Amy Fibus has 
been playing with an injured shoulder. Unfor
tunately on the second day of the tournament 
during her singles match, she reinjured her 
shoulder. The Emory Trainer said Fibus
continued on page 23
the Lady Tomcats off guard several times. 
Carnegie Mellon recorded 7 serving aces in 
the match, as well as 8 service errors and 23 
hitting errors.
The tournament started with a continuation 
of the climb. Senior setter Marianne Smith, 
who was named to the conferences second 
team, served up an ace in the opener against 
Case Western Reserve. Senior Diane Watson 
followed with four more points, giving Carne
gie Mellon a quick 5-0 lead. The senior middle 
hitter from Washington added four more servcontinued on page 24
the half due to injuries.
The Washington and Jefferson offense that 
emerged from the locker room at halftime wq ) 
the one leading the conference with 35 points 
per game average, not the one that had been 
held to a touchdown by the Tartans.
A.J. Pagano showed why he deserved AllAmerica honors by bursting through the line,

The mens soccer team hit the road last 
week, travelling to neighboring Univer
sity of Pittsburgh on Wednesday and to 
Bethany on Saturday. The Tartans 
battled to a 1-0 victory over the Pan
thers, but lost in double overtime to the 
Bisons 6-2.
Against Division I Pittsburgh, sopho
more goalie Glen Hoogerwerf recorded 
his seventh shutout of the season, and

Mayr went out with a knee injury early 
in the season, underwent orthoscopic 
surgery, and was not expected to re

played in both the Pitt game and the 
Bethany game.
On Saturday, the Tartans were over
powered by Bethany, yielding four 1

forboding Symphony, written during his es
cape from Nazi Germany in the 1930s was 
juxtaposed against Brahms pastoral Sym
phony which expressed the composers con
tentment during a sojourn in the countryside. 
The program for the evening opened omi
nously with Weills Symphony No. 2. Weill, a 
German composer who lived from 1900-1950, 
s primarily recognized for his works in musi
cal theatre such as The Threepenny Opera 
while his symphonic works have been se
verely neglected. Weills Symphony No. 2 is 
noted for its undiluted brass tones and for 
Weills expression of the dark forces of death 
and oppression in his work.
The haunting and insistent strings of the 
introduction of the first movement, Sostenuto, 
set the mood for the rest of the piece. After the 
opening, the first movement shifts between 
various tempos under this same theme. The 
Sostenuto calls for a trumpet solo in the style 
of a funeral march and serene woodwind solos 
that break the intensity of the strings and brass.
For the most part, the Philharmonic handled 
the technical complexity of the first movement 
with great dexterity. The woodwinds and 
strings performed with skill as did the low 
brass. However, throughout this whole move
ment, the trumpets were brash and overbear
ing and did not effectively express the discor
dant quality that Weill intended for this move
ment. Despite these problems, Thome impres
sively guided the Philharmonic through the 
tempo changes of this movement.
The trumpet solo in the style of a funeral 
march in the Sostenuto recurs in the opening of 
the second movement, Largo. The feeling of
dread is repeated throughout this movement 
but is broken by the placid solo lines which 
were deftly performed by the members of the 
Philharmonic. In particular, the performance 
of the trombone solo expressed the mournful 
quality that Weill intended and the soloist 
handled the syncopated rhythms with ease. 
The Largo movement ends on a gentle note 
with a soft chord in the woodwinds. While the 
intonation on this chord was excellent, the 
Philharmonic had difficulty following Thome 
in his cut-off.
The third movement of Weill's Symphony 
No. 2, Allegro vivace, began with another 
technically challenging and frantic melody in 
the woodwinds and low brass. The 
Philharmonics rendition of these passages 
was superb. The mood of the third movement 
is not as black as the other two but the cheerful 
woodwind solos are undermined by an omi
nous accompaniment of harsh brass and dis
cordant trumpets. The Philharmonics per
formance of the Allegro vivace featured an 
exceptionally strong clarinet solo and good 
timpani work throughout.
After the intense work of 20th century com
poser Weill, the Philharmonic concluded the 
concert with the pastoral and lighthearted 
Symphony No. 2 by Brahms, a conventional 
19th century composer. After writing his 
Symphony in the countryside of the Carpa
thian mountains, Brahms said it might have 
been written for a pair of newlyweds and this 
sentiment carried across in the interpretation 
of his work by Thome and the Philharmonic.
Brahms second symphony is divided into 
four movements which all are indicative of the 
contented nature of the piece: Allegro non 
troppo. Adagio non troppo. Allegretto grazioso and Allegro con sprito.
The Allegro non troppo is written in a quiet 
and lyric vein and describes the relaxation of 
Brahms' sojourn. The opening with the cellos

,Dsfsryf7 Portrait
By MICHAEL ROSE
Diversions Theater Critic 
Carnegie Mellon Drama, in association w ith 
Chiron Productions, Ltd., is presenting the 
premiere workshop production of "Portrait," a 
new musical by Ed Dixon. Portrait" opens 
November 4 for previews and the anticipation 
is building both in and outside Kresge Theatre.
Portrait is based on Oscar Wilde's The 
Picture Of Dorian Gray but does not occur in 
the same venue as the novel. Portrait is set in 
the present day and deals in a contemporary 
way with the spiritual battles that are the es
sence of Wildes piece..., says author Dixon, 
who is performing in Portrait in addition to 
creating it.
At first glance. Dixon didn't like the idea of 
using Wildes work as the basis for a show. It 
falls in 1850s London, so thats y very spe
cific kind of sound, musically... And to write 
about the leisure class didn't very much inter
est me, although the spiritual struggle of the 
piece was very interesting. So all of a sudden 
I looked at it again and thought. What if 1 
moved it to the present? No one has their 
portrait painted today except actors.' Sud
denly 1 saw a whole new focus: corruption in 
the arts and the contemporary corruption of 
society, says Dixon.
The production carries the tag workshop" 
because this will be the first time that Por
trait will be performed before an audience. 
However, this doesnt imply that Portrait is 
not a full-scale mainstage production, since 
this presentation is something of a tryingout period that all new works go through. 
Time was when a new play or musical went 
out-of-town (meaning out of New York 
City) on tour to work the kinks out and refine 
the piece before coming home to the Great 
White Way. Many popular shows on Broad
way started their pre-tours unrecognizably 
different from what is performed today. Some 
examples from the "Portrait program: The 
classic My Fair Lady was a flop until last 
minute changes were made. In the first per
formances of Broadways longest running 
musical A Chorus Line, there was no happy  
ending - the character of Cassie remained an 
outcast, a victim of her success. Oklahoma just 
didnt cut it, since it lacked its knee-slapping

Tabula Rasa explores the edless drama of life from the clean slate at birth to the changes wrought by experience.
Ballet Shines in Second World Premiere
By LISA MCANANY
Tartan Contributing Editor 
Pittsburghs new Benedum Center pro
vided a magnificent setting for the Pitts
burgh Ballet Theatres second perform
ance of the season. And a strong perform
ance it was, despite only a week's rehearsal 
time since last weekends season opener. 
The Great Gatsby. For the most part, the 
company looked confident and in control 
through all three of the short ballets that 
comprised the performance. The evening 
began with George Balanchines Sere
nade; Israeli choreographer Ohad 
Naharins dark and disturbing Tabula 
Rasa followed and the world premier bal
let Coursings choreographed by PBT
ballet master Rick McCullough closed the 
performance.
The excellent acoustics, the imposing dark 
wood arch that frames the stage, and the 
enormous stage of the Benedum only en
hanced the performance. Not only is the size of 
the stage beneficial for the dancers, its solid 
construction means that noise made by the 
dancers is minimal. In Heinz Hall, PBTs 
former home, the hollow stage made for a 
veritable chorus of bangs and thumps during 
ballets with a reliance on aerial movements.
Balanchines Serenade, danced to 
Tchaikovskys Serenade for String Orches
tra, Opus 48, is a plotless, almost passionless 
ballet. Characterized by intricate patterns and 
often rigidly controlled movements, Sere
nade hints at the tribulations of lovers but 
maintains a sense of simplicity and seren
ity. The pale blue costumes and plain 
backdrop of the same color are strictly 
classical, but Balanchines choreography 
is not. Balanchine takes standard ballet 
movements and modifies them, drawing 
attention to the conventions of classical 
dance. Dancers stand flat on their feet and 
suddenly rock into pointe, and back down; 
a dancer runs and leaps only to be caught 
and held frozen in mid-air. These unusual 
movements provide the only moments of 
tension in the otherwise serene ballet.
Serenade" requires tremendous control 
on the part of the dancers, control that

title number. There are countless other ex
amples.
In todays big business world of the theater, 
the amazing caravan of glorious theater his
tory that was the out-of-town trial is simply 
too grandiose and expensive to work with and 
has in recent years all but disappeared. To 
serve the function of the trial tours, ...the 
workshop was invented to let [the] creative 
staff get together and look at how elements 
work in front of an audience, and then change 
elements that dont work, says Dixon. Most 
of today's Broadway hits, especially those 
written within the last six years or so, had their 
roots in university workshop productions, 
including such plays as Neil Simons Broad
way Bound and the Tony-award winning 
Fences by August Wilson.
-Carnegie Mellon Drama became associated 
with "Portrait through Helen Lee Henderson, 
a CMU Drama alumna (Class of '67) and 
president of Chiron Productions, a New York 
production company. (Incidentally, Ms.
Hendersons mother is also a CMU Drama 
alumna). Ms. Henderson was involved five 
years ago with another workshop production 
here at CMU of a piece called Rachinoff. 
The production gave her the idea of bringing 
another premiere musical to CMU. In New 
York, her company produced Dixons opera 
Shylock based on The Merchant Of Venice, 
in which Dixon played the title role. (Dixon 
was nominated for a Drama Desk award - 
Outstanding Actor in a Musical - for the part, 
which is the first time the nomination has ever 
been extended to an actor in a role of his own 
creation.) After Shylock, Henderson heard 
some of Dixons songs for Portrait and 
brought the new work to the attention of 
Drama Dean Elisabeth Orion. While Dixon 
was in Pittsburgh last summer (performing in 
CLOs 1776) the faculty of the Drama Dept, 
held a backers audition at the home of 
Barbara and Cletus Anderson, professors of 
design in the Drama Department. Dixon 
played and sang the songs from his draft of 
Portrait and performed the dialogue for his
captive audience, and at the end of the recital, 
Dean of Fine Arts Akram Midani reportedly 
stood up and said, I like it. Well do it! 
Student reaction to the production has been 
excellent, according to Assistant Dean of 
Drama Don Marinelli. He says that there is a 
great deal of enthusiasm in the production due 
to the creative excitement of doing a new 
piece. The students are wholeheartedly 
warming to their roles as creative consultants 
in the shaping of the work, and they realize that 
what they do now will have a major influence 
on future productions of Portrait - all the 
way to Broadway, even. The feeling is 
heightened by the fact that you hope theres a 
future for it - theres the possibility. With any 
new piece, one expects a certain number of 
snafus since the work is done sans example or
continued from page D1
and the woodwinds was performed with skill. 
The performance in the strings was impressive 
throughout the whole movement However, 
there were problems in the brass and wood
winds which marred the Philharmonics per
formance of the Allegro non troppo. In the 
brass, the french horns were too loud and had 
substantial intonation problems. The phrasing 
in the woodwinds could have been more ex
pressive; it seemed constrained and awkward 
against the relaxed theme of the movement. 
The flute solo was difficult to hear due to the 
lack of projection by the soloist. The most 
serious problems in the first movement arose 
from the Philharmonics awkward following 
of Thomes direction in the tempo changes at 
the end of the movement 
The Philharmonic fared better in their per
formance of the second movement, Adagio 
non troppo. The movement began with an
history - but things seem to be going remarka
bly well for the show. In fact, says Marinelli, 
and I dont want to jinx it by saying this(knocks on wood) - everything seems to be 
right on track.
The director of Portrait is Lee Sankowich 
and this is his third show for the Kresge The
atre. He is a professor of acting at CMU and 
first achieved success with his production of 
One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest, which ran 
for several years in New York. He is also 
directing Mary Barnes, the next mainstage 
show, and will direct Arthur Girons Edith 
Stein opening in January at the Public Theatre.
Performances of Portrait will be at 8 pm 
November4,5(previews),6,7,and 10-14, and 
at 2 pm November 7 and 14. For information

expressive melody in the cellos and continued 
with a gentle string melody throughout the 
movement. The performances of the strings ^ 
were first-rate, but once again, there were in
tonation problems in the french horns.
Overall, the Philharmonic adeptly presented 
the romantic and serene theme of this move
ment.
The third movement, Allegretto grazioso, 
was strongly influenced by German folk melo
dies. In this movement, the performance of the 
Philharmonic was more than competent. ^ 
However, the climax of the concert was the 
last movement, Allegro con spirito. The faults 
in the first movement were reconciled by the 
flawlessness of the performance in the last 
movement. The Philharmonic successfully 
expressed the spontaneity and the unification 
of the first three movements in the Allegro con 
spirito and Thome brought the concert to a 
triumphant close. m
About the Author: Ed Dixon

Big Generator Provides Progressive Rock Power
By JAVIER GRILLO-MARXUACH
Diversions Staffwriter 
YES
Big Generator
Since the 1982 release of their highly suc
cessful comeback album, 90125, the British 
progressive rock outfit YES has been promis
ing a follow up. Five years, one concert tour 
and one marginally interesting live album 
later, YES has finally delivered a studio album 
entitled Big Generator. The album is a far cry 
from the self-indulgent experimental al
bums of the 70s; nowhere in Big Generator 
will you find the excesses of earlier projects. 
What you will find is a collection of seven 
polished songs which synthesize YES earlier 
orchestral influences and pop conventions.
There is no doubt that Big Generator is 
highly commercial; the two opening tracks, 
Rhythm of Love and Big Generator both 
feature heavy synthesizers, catchy melodies 
and rhythms which are destined for Top-40 
airplay. However, both of these songs benefit 
from the harder edged guitar sound of Trevor 
Rabin and Chris Squire. Songs such as Love 
Will Find a Way, Final Eyes, and the all
acoustic Holy Lamb rely on Squire and 
Rabins mastery of the guitar rather than the 
keyboards so prevalent in 90125.
This harder guitar sound is not the only 
quality of Big Generator which harks back to 
the early days; another is song length. Al
though this record is devoid of such excesses 
as the side long album cut, the songs in Big 
Generator are longer. This allows the band to 
feature in them many of their musical signa
tures; tempo and melody changes and elabo
rate transitions are present in songs such as 
Final Eyes,Big Generator, and Shoot 
High, Aim Low.
Musically, the band plays masterfully. Tony 
Kayes synthesizers dominate and enhance in
equal portions throughout the album. Alan 
White capably carries out his duties behind the 
drums, pulling off several remarkable flour
ishes in the process. And Jon Andersons 
male-soprano voice remains one of the more 
unusual and engaging in rock, especially when 
counterpointed by Chris Squires baritone.
There is some bad news. Unfortunately, YES 
remains a charter member of the Great House 
of Lyrical Insignificance. The people who 
brought us the classic non sequitor In and 
around the lake/Mountains come out of the 
sky/And they stand there, again hit us with a

Diversions Record Critic 
Plan 9 
Sea Hunt
Too cool. With their fourth album, Plan 9, the 
mega-guitar band from Rhode Island moves 
even farther away from their neo-psychedelic 
roots with brand new touches of blues and jazz 
only hinted at on their previous albums.
The albums first song, Hat Comes First, 
leads off with a chewy chunka-chunkachunka guitar riff lifted from the 70s song 
Seven or Nine, and holds the same choppy 
pattern for about half of the song, when it skids 
into a concrete-smooth rocker chock full of 
early Seventies grunge rock. The rest of the 
side is the same sort of melodic guitars that 
gave the Seventies something to be proud of 
(and something to long for when Boston and 
YES were invented). The aforementioned first 
song, as well as the second and third songs 
The Figures and Man Bites Dog, is the 
best stuff on the first side; the rest is somewhat 
derivative. Even so, the boring stuff is only 
relatively boring; Plan 9 has been doing this
barrage of lyrical nonsense. There are impos
sible geographical descriptions (the blue 
fields and crimson sand in Shoot High, Aim 
Low,) improbable machines (...flying out 
the soft machines we are but all surprise to 
you/Praise, oh, praise this anthem generator 
moving through the night,) uncommon mete
orological phenomena (thunder burrowing 
through the hearts of men,) confusing analo
gies (something is compared to the black and 
white of love,) and rhymes created solely for 
musical convenience (evolution is rhymed 
with Shakespeare revolution,). To be fair, a
sort of multi-guitar (four of them at times) rock 
for years now, and can do it better than most 
bands could ever hope to. Big layers of guitars 
settle out in the tunes, usually with a lone 
guitar sitting on top along with Eric Stumpos 
sand-smooth vocals. Nothing new on this side, 
just the same old guitars in the garage. Way 
cool stuff.
The big surprise comes on side two, which 
leads off with drums without guitars, a definite 
rarity in this band. Beyond Mombasa grabs 
its lead quasi-African drums and runs straight 
into guitars (again). The combination is rather 
mind-blowing in intensity. However, the 
drums go out the side just as quickly as they 
came in, because they arent on the next song, 
Sea Hunt. The title track starts off with 
acoustic guitars and bongos playing with a 
mild riff, soon to be joined by the normal 
electrics and bass, but the riff remains until the 
whole mess fades out, only to be resurrected 
by a slide guitar part, which gets layered over 
Hendrix-style. Once again, the whole mess 
fades out, and is again replaced, this time by a 
jazzy piano base and guitar lead. Epic stuff at
lot of it makes some sense. However, Big Gen
erator is further proof of one of YES main 
flaws, the tendency to sacrifice lyrical content 
for musical convenience.
Regardless of the complaints over YES' 
lyrics, die music remains stunning, the pro
duction by ex YES-man Trevor Horn and Paul 
DeVilliers is impeccable. The sound and the 
voices are powerful and clear. If Big Gen
erator is any indication, the current incarna
tion of YES will continue to flourish, and the 
banner of progressive rock will continue to fly, 
but in a more restrained manner than before.
an epic length of eleven minutes, immediately 
followed by Human Mertzes, clocking in at 
a whopping eleven seconds (maybe), which 
puts the band back into the guitar-rock thing 
for the rest of the side. Too, too cool.
This album is a wonderful addition to 
anyone's room. A perfect antidote to stupid 
synth bands - blow 'em back with guitars. This 
is a band that deserves to be noticed. So notice 
them. The purveyors of this wonderful noise 
are coming to town on November 8 at the 
Decade. Call the club at 687-7655 for details 
on the cover charge and time of the show.

Harry Angel, played by Mickey Rourke, is a private eye during the 1950s. In his latest

crooner who owes something to Cyphre. Simple, right? Wrong. This eerie, mind-blowing, 
erotic, provocative film leads Angel to New Orleans where he finds himself in the middle 
of occult sacrifices and killings. A 10-second scene between Angel and voodoo queen 
Ephiphany Proudfoot (Lisa Bonet) was cut from the movie to keep Angel Heart from being 
rated X. It was not the pure sex of the scene, but the occult overtones and blood-spattering 
voodoo which surrounded it that upset the censors. Although strong, this movie is 
extremely well-done as it never leaves the plot and the audience never leaves their seat.

Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre
continued from page D1
wasnt always there for PBT on Saturday 
night. Unity of timing and placement was not 
always there for the female corps, and a num
ber of wobbly pirouettes in the pas de deux 
detracted slightly from the performance 
Tabula Rasa is as tense, dark and uncon
trolled as Serenade is quiet and light. EstoMian composer Arvo Parts haunting minimal
ist music sets the tone for the pessimistic view 
of the human condition that the ballet offers. 
Danced in costumes of muted shades; shirts 
and pants for men, simple dresses for the 
women, all designed by Christina Giannini, 
the ballet takes place in an atmosphere of halflight against a black back-drop. Falling com
fortably into the genre of modem ballet,
i j Tabula Rasa uses unusual, often infantile or 
inhuman movements to illustrate the process 
by which people who are bom as a tabula rasa 
or clean slate, are changed and affected by 
the circumstances of their lives. The move
ments depict loneliness, isolation, sadness, 
and failure to communicate.
The first movement is a flurry of activity with 
a dozen dancers on the stage, but often acting 
\ individually rather than in cooperation or 
unison. By contrast, the second movement is 
as minimalist as Parts score. Small move
ments, often numbingly slow and repetitive, 
cast a pallor over the ballet and the audience. 
Tabula Rasa was commissioned by the
Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre with a grant from the 
National Choreography Project, funded 
jointly by the Rockefeller Foundation, Exxon 
Corporation, and the National Endowment for 
the Arts. PBT world premiered the ballet in 
1986.
Coursings is best described as a lyrical 
ballet because of its flowing movements and 
waterfall, fast-paced Mendelssohn score. The 
dancers wear beautiful costumes designed by 
Susan McCullough (the choreographers wife 
and the director of the PBT school). Watercolor tones of blue, brown, and pink on a white 
background perfectly suited Mendelssohns 
Celebra Ottetto, Opus 20. Choreographed in 
three movements, the work immediately takes 
the audience by surprise with its synthesis of 
classical and modem movements, and the first 
movement has a unique flair about it that 
unfortunately fades as the ballet progresses 
onward.
With the demanding speed of the Men
delssohn score, the ballet drifts dangerously 
close to monotony. The choreography sacri
fices texture to simple pacekeeping, and thus 
fails to take advantage of some of the best 
movements in the music, which was master
fully performed by the Pittsburgh Ballet Or
chestra under conductor Octavia deRosa. The 
creation and performance of Coursings was 
funded by a grant from the Pennsylvania 
Council for the Arts.

Anne Wagner and Mary Carlisle at Forbes
By EDIE LOCKE
Special to Diversions
Tonights opening at the Forbes Gallery 
will feature the work of seniors Anne 
Wagner and Mary Carlisle. Both artists' 
work is concerned with texture and surface 
and the manipulated, tactile qualities of 
those surfaces.
Wagner and Carlisle draw on the ele
ments for inspiration in their work; Mary 
uses fire and Anne uses water. Anne will be 
showing painted glass sculptures which she 
considers primarily landscape with many 
of water forms and references. Wagner is 
new to sculpture and finds that she enjoys it 
more than two dimensional art. She still 
considers her work to be drawing and paint
ing, but likes the idea of putting two dimen
sional art on a three dimensional medium. 
I was at a loss with the canvas and kept 
getting stuck, Anne explains. With glass, 
there is already an image in the sculpture 
youre one step ahead. While she consid
ers her combination sculpture/paintings to 
be more fun than canvas she eventually 
hopes to go back to that two dimensional 
form.
Mary Carlisles work is about fire and 
landscapes. She will be showing mostly 
photographs with one or two paintings and 
a videotape. The paintings, made with wax, 
tar, sheet metal and photo-processes are 
ways of getting at photography without 
using photographs themselves. The work 
is large and Carlisle, a transfer student from 
the Art Institute of Chicago, explains that 
her previous study of performance art 
makes her crave immediacy with other art 
forms she works in. She considers photo
graphs small and too intimate so she 
makes them bigger by projecting the image 
onto a large, light-sensitive canvas, stating, 
I want something confrontational.
There will be a videotape, Arson, showing 
burning furniture in landscapes with a 
human side. It takes on a different meaning 
than the pictures, Carlisle states. Mary 
constantly refers back to mythology and 
religion, since her interest lies in playing 
with the dual roles fire has there  as a 
destructive and purifying force. She ex
plains, People can get from the fire what 
they want, but I hope they will come away 
with some sense of their own perception.
S he sees fire as destructive but explains that 
for artists, it is our job to prompt different 
responses.
Landscapes hold a moody seductiveness 
for Carlisle and she feels that they are 
something everyone has in common. She 
adds that landscapes possess a sensuous
ness and humanness even though there may 
be no human presence. Because nature is 
so vast and sublime it gives man his place in 
the world and helps keep ourselves in 
perspective.
While her work has certain dream/night
mare qualities to it, Carlisle does not con
sider herself a surrealist, explaining sim
ply, Im attracted to things with an edge. 
She starts with an idea and uses the materi
als which will best realize that idea, stating, 
I find the best means to the end. Carlisle 
considers herself an impatient artist who 
does not spend enough time on each work: 
None of the pieces are masters. Every
thing in the show is an experiment I  ve been 
working with for the past two months.
