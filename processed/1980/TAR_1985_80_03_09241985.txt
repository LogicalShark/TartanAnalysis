CMU acquires U.S. 
Bureau of Mines complex
By ALBRECHT T. POWELL
Tartan Staffwriter
Carnegie-Mellon University will have 
outright possession of the U.S. Bureau of 
Mines complex on Sept. 30, 1985 at a cost 
of $5.8 million.
This step marks the kind of outward ex
pansion not seen since the early 70s when 
Skibo and Wean Hall were built.
CMU has been trying to acquire the 
USBOM buildings ever since President 
Warner proposed the plan back in 1957. It 
took twenty years of fighting with the help 
of Senators and CMU officials to have 
authorization passed for the purchase of the 
U.S. Government property.
As the USBOM is a part of the Interior 
of the Government, all negotiations had to 
go through Congress. In the early part of 
1981, the property was purchased with the 
agreement that the USBOM be moved late 
in 1985.
The only problem with the plan is that 
the buildings are not in very good shape. 
Fred Rogers, Vice President of Business Af
fairs said, There is a lot of work needed 
since they havent been extremely well main
tained. The U.S. Government is exempt 
from building codes and inspections so their 
buildings are not as well kept as those on our 
campus. That will be changed. He con
tinued by saying that . . . there is not even 
a centralized fire alarm. They have hand 
held horns that are supposed to alert the en
tire building of a fire. . .
The added work necessary to bring the 
buildings up to standards will be greatly off
set by their usefulness and necessity for the 
campus community. Out of the six major 
buildings, CMU will be using all but one and 
a half. One organization associated with the 
USBOM, the Mine Safety and Health Ad
ministration (MSHA), will be leasing the re
maining buildings space from CMU. This 
will help to offset the cost of the complex.
The sp3ce opened by this acquisition 
will mostly be utilized in two areas. The first 
will be basic Administrative purposes, such 
as printing, Physical Plant, grounds keepers
and some offices. The other major move will 
be SUPA. The extra space in Margaret Mor
rison, Porter Hall and other academic 
buildings on campus will .. make CMU the 
best it can be for its students, according to 
Rogers.
Another situation helped by the acquisi
tion will be Parking. About 200 extra spaces 
will be available to students, which will more 
than make up for those lost by the Mellon 
Institute parking lot closure.
When asked about the new debts incurred 
from the cost of the acquisition, Rogers 
replied, When youve been waiting 30 years 
to get the property, you just buy it. The 
funding for these projects does not come 
from tuition.
As part of the Master Plan, all funding 
will be received through outside sources such 
as grants and fund raisers. The older debt 
stemming from the building of Wean Hall 
stands at around $2 million.
One such hope is for .. .someone to 
donate the $5 million for the buildings and 
possibly have the complex named after 
them. Until that time comes, though, they 
will probably still be referred to at the 
Bureau of Mines, said Rogers.
The long term plans for the USBOM will 
include the destruction of all but two of the 
buildings, so that new ones may be erected. 
These new buildings will be mostly 
laboratories with a large parking garage 
underneath. The buildings will be done in 
the same architectural style as the rest of the 
campus to keep its unified appearance.
Eventually, CMU hopes to acquire the 
Naval Reserve station which . .is something 
we are pursuing. I can see it within the next 
10-15 years, Rogers said. The entire Master 
Plan includes and extensive addition to 
Skibo, a new set of academic buildings built 
parallel to Doherty and Wean creating a 
second cut, as well as the conference center, 
the USBOM complex and multiple addi
tions to academic buildings. The whole 
plan, expected to cost around $100 million 
(which will be all funded through outside 
sources and fundraisers) is an eventual real
ity for CMU.

CMUs Student Senate opposed a propos
ed curfew on Pittsburghs young adults at its 
weekly meeting last Tuesday.
The ordinance for a curfew, introduced 
to city council by councilman Steven 
Grabowski on Sept. 9, would prohibit per
sons 18 or younger from going out after 10 
p.m. on weeknights and 11 p.m. on 
weekends.
There are a lot of people on campus who 
wouldnt be allowed to go to Oakland and 
other places at night, said Campus Affairs 
Committee chair Peter Cohen. We also have 
lots of freshmen living off-campus.
Pitts Student Government Board oppos
ed the ordinance at its first meeting Sept. 12. 
At that meeting, however, a spokesperson for 
Councilman Grabowski said that the curfew 
would not necessarily be focused upon col
lege students.
It will mainly be centered on kids hang
ing out on street comers and creating distur
bances, said the spokesperson. We cant do 
anything about this now, but with this [pro
posed] curfew, they can tell them to leave or 
actually remove the kids themselves.
CMU Campus Security Sgt. Russ doesnt 
think the ordinance, if it passes, will affect 
CMU too much. The campus is an exten
sion of [the students] home. Well make sure 
no one bothers them. Most of our problem 
on campus is with outsiders, and the or
dinance will cut down on that.
Russ noted that in some areas of Pitt
sburgh [a curfew] is necessary.. .you will see 
quite a few kids hanging around.

Later this year, Carnegie-Mellon Univer
sity, the University of Pittsburgh and 
Westinghouse Electric Corporation will 
receive a supercomputer from the Lewis 
Research Center in Cleveland. The Cray
IS, and improvement upon the Cray 1 which 
was first produced in the mid 1970s, will be 
operated and maintained for the group by 
Westinghouse.
Todays supercomputer breeds are com
pared on the basis of speed, measured in 
megaflops (millions of operations per se
cond), and they usually lie in the range of 
about 30 to 1000 megaflops. The cray IS can 
perform up to 160 megaflops at peak capaci
ty, about ten times as fast as any of the com
puters currently operating at either CMU or 
Pitt.
The two men involved in investigationg 
the project are Michael Levine, professor of 
physics at Carnegie-Mellon, and Ralph 
Roskies, professor of physics at Pitt. Roskies 
explained, Scientists believe that supercom
puters are the only feasible way of tackling 
complex problems that require billions of 
calculations to solve  problems such as 
weather forecasting and predicting the crea
tion and movement of tornadoes. They are
that in the spirit of the proposal lies the 
potential for discrimination.
We should try to work under existing 
laws, said Senator Seana Chun, adding that 
police may be more likely to check the iden
tification of blacks than whites.
Student senator Nadine Flynn said that 
the proposed curfew directly violates the 1st 
Amendment of the US. Constitutions clause 
stating, ..the right of the people peaceably 
to assemble...
According to Flynn, the proposed curfew 
also violates the 14th Amendment, which 
protects citizens from abridgement of 
privileges or immunities.
Cohen noted the recent overturning of 
Philadelphia Citys curfew by Municipal 
Court Judge Thomas J. McCormack.
In explanation of his ruling , McCormack 
stated that the curfew interfered with the 
First Amendment right of young people to 
assemble.
Student Senate plans to act against the or
dinance through a campus-wide petition 
and a letter directed to Mayor Richard 
Caliguiri and the City Council. Said Cohen, 
We are also requesting that if there is a 
public hearing, we should be allowed to 
speak.
Student Senate President Karen Lee is 
coordinating the petition, which will be 
available for students to peruse on Thurs
day and Friday in front of Doherty Hall.
City Council is supposed to decide the fate 
of the proposal at the public hearing in 
several weeks. In the meantime, however, 
everyone in Student Senate is going to get 
involved with this, said Cohen.

Campus Police urges marking of valuables
By CAROLYN KELLY
Tartan Staffwriter
The CMU Campus Police has set in mo
tion Operation Identification, a program 
designed to help students protect their pro
perty through engraving.
Valuables such as stereos, cameras and 
television sets can be engraved with 
Drivers/Operators numbers.
Security Director Robert S. Fadzen, Sr., 
said that engraving personal property doesnt 
necessarily mean that it will be safer from 
theft, but that it will make items more dif
ficult to pawn. Engraving also increases the 
chances of recovering lost property and suc
cessfully prosecuting the perpetrator.
The benefits of this program do not end 
when a student graduates from CMU; his or

Twelve members of CMUs Students For 
Choice (SFC) served as escorts for women 
seeking gynecological service at the 
Womens Health Services building and the 
Summit Medical Center.
This group joined with members of the 
Beaver County chapter of the National 
Organization for Women (NOW) on Sat., 
Sept. 14 in hopes of suppressing rumored at
tempts by pro-lifers to storm the clinics
According to SFC co-founder Katherine 
Robinson, pro-life advocators routinely 
protest against abortion at the health clinics 
on Saturdays because that is primarily when
her numbers remain a part of a permanent 
record.
When the police recover stolen goods, any 
special markings are entered into a com
puter at the National Crime Information 
Center. If valuables are stolen, they will be 
registered along with the serial number in 
the computer at NCIC. A match can be 
made and the owner contacted immediately.
Crime Prevention Officer Sergeant Russ 
said that various locations will be designated 
on campus as places for students to have 
their valuables engraved. There will be 
posters throughout the campus advertising 
these places and times.
Unfortunately, the Police were at the 
Spirit House and Woodlawn Apartments 
already. The turnout was very small
the procedures are performed.
During the protests, the prolifers display 
vivid anti-abortion posters and distribute 
anti-abortion literature to women entering 
the clinic which, Robinson claims can be 
very disconcerting to a woman who has 
already made the decision to have an 
abortion.
At 7 a.m. that morning, six SFC members 
gathered at the Womens Health Services 
building downtown, while six others travel
ed to the Summit clinic. Robinson stated 
that the purpose of their presence was to 
serve as buffers for the women entering the 
clinics and to provide moral support for the 
personnel.
because the operation had not been properly 
publicized. However, another date will be set 
at both of these locations if requests are 
made.
Russ also said that if the dates and times 
are inconvenient for some students, or if they 
have several valuables they wish to mark, the 
Police will loan them the engraver. In order 
to borrow it, students have only to leave their 
ID card at the Security Office in Baker Hall. 
When theyve finished, they can return the 
engraver and give the police a list of the 
items they have marked and their serial 
number.
The number of thefts on campus is 
relatively low and has decreased during the 
past few years, however, the possibility of 
theft remains.
Robinson stated that no violent acts were 
committed on Saturday, although some 
heated discussion between pro-life and 
pro-choice activists did evolve at the Sum
mit clinic.
Robinson noted that WHS personnel 
welcome the help of SFC and other prochoice groups because the clinics security 
system is unable to receive police protection. 
Thus far, the situation has fallen under the 
jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation.
The constant fear of violence has been the 
driving force of efforts to organize escorts on 
pro-life target days, according to SFC 
member Catherine Singstad. People should 
be aware that this goes on all the time.
For the 1983-84 school year, there was 
a total of 177 thefts on campus. In 137 cases, 
the property was stolen from unlocked 
rooms. In another 29 cases, the property was 
locked up, but the perpetrator gained acces to the rooms through the use of a key. 
In only 11 cases were the thefts the result of 
forced entry.
The Police would like to increase security 
awareness on campus. They have designed 
a pocket  sized guide of safety tips and are 
soon to distribute a handbook that will in
form people of how to protect their 
valuables, their homes and themselves.
Sergeant Ricci will be conducting a series 
of seminars on Street Safety, and a film en
titled Nobodys Victim, will be shown on 
campus.
More people have survived cancer than now live in the City of Los Angeles.
We are winning.

3:30  5:00pm
Plans arc already in place to deploy powerful workstations across 
campus next year. But what progress has been made towards creating 
high-quality educational applications that exploit the unusual properties 
of these machines? And how easy is it to buUd new applications?
This presentation answers those questions by giving the university 
community its first look at new courseware designed by CMU 
faculty members. These programs have been implemented on advanced 
function workstations running the Andrew system, designed by the 
Information Technology Center. They arc being developed with the 
assistance of grants from the Center for Design of Educational 
Computing.
Developers will demonstrate their projects, discuss their goals and 
objectives, and explain how the software will be used eventually by 
students. The presentation will also take advantage of Doherty Halls 
newly installed projection system to give attendees a high-resoluticn 
view of the entire 1,000-by-1,000 workstation screen.
Presentations will be made by: '

CMU has participated in the Washington 
Semester program offered by the American 
University in Washington D.C., for almost 
twenty years. The program itself is about 
forty years old and involves approximately 
200 colleges and universities around the na
tion. Students spend one semester at the 
American University gaining in-depth ex
perience in one of five fields: American na
tional government, politics, economic policy, 
journalism or justice. During the semester, 
the students curriculum includes: a seminar, 
an internship, a research project, and in 
some cases, a course of the students choos
ing from American University.
Approximately 400 students from around 
the country take part in this program dur
ing any one semester. These students remain 
largely separate from the campus 
mainstream. The seminars are conducted by 
full-time professors of the American Univer
sity faculty, but are not open to American 
University students. In addition, the 
Washington Semester students are housed in 
their own dormitory. This separation has its 
relative advantages for the visiting students. 
For example: a CMU student participating
in this program maintains his status as a 
CMU student and is simply considered to be 
in residence in Washington D.C. for a 
semester. Also, students pay regular CMU 
tuition and must only pay American Univer
sitys room and board fee.
Rob Berkowitz, currently a senior major
ing in technical writing, spent a semester in 
Washington in 1984. He worked as an intern 
for the air and space department of the 
Smithsonian Institute in journalism.
According to Rob, the most surprising 
thing about the program is that no one here 
knows about it. He points out that at other 
schools which take part in the program, the 
competition for a place in the program is 
fierce, whereas at CMU, nearly anyone who 
demonstrates an interest can go.
Dr. Eugene Levy, associate head of the 
history and philosophy department here at 
CMU, maintains the liaison between 
Carnegie-Mellon and the American Univer
sity. He too is pleased with the experiences 
individual students have had during their 
Washington Semester, and recognizes the ex
cellent opportunities which the program af
fords. Dr. Levy is available to any students 
wishing to gain further knowledge about the 
Washington Semester Program.

Phil Kragnes: There's not a lot he doesn't do
By CHRISTY CASAMASSIMA
Tartan Features Editor
Phil Kragnes lost total vision to Diabetic 
Retinopoly three weeks into his senior year 
in high school. He dropped all of his classes 
except for English and still graduated on 
time with the rest of his class.
Although he faced a number of obstacles, 
Phil decided to continue his education at 
Montgomery Community College, where he 
learned to use braille, type, and get around 
with a cane. But Phil wanted more than an 
Associate of Academics degree, which was 
all the school offered, so he decided to look 
into other colleges. Phil applied to CMU 
with an interest in Cognitive Psychology and 
Computer Science, however, CMU didnt 
have much previous experience with blind 
students. In addition, CMU was hesitant 
about laying out the funds for the readers 
and scribes needed to help Phil with his 
schoolwork. Then Jay Devine, Dean of 
H&SS, stepped in. He found out that the 
Pittsburgh Association for Blindness was 
willing to pay for Phils scribes and readers, 
along with granting additional financial aid 
for Phils tuition. So Phil was admitted this 
fall as a second semester sophomore.
Phil plans to remain at CMU for his 
undergraduate and graduate studies. He is 
working towards his Ph.D in Cognitive 
Psychology and hopes to become a teacher. 
His main ambition is to work with people. 
I love people, I like to help them. Thats 
why Phil has decided to go into teaching, 
counseling service, or research. He feels that 
psychology and teaching will afford him the 
opportunity to help people and be in cons
tant contact with them.
Phil has been blind for three years. At first 
he used a cane to get around, but for the 
past year and a half hes had Orlan, a seeingeye dog. This dog is amazing; it is trained 
to get Phil places and move around people.
Phil wants people to know that although 
Orlan is a German Sheperd, he will not bite. 
However, if Phil is walking along campus 
with Orlan on his harness, please do not try 
to pet him because he is trained to avoid all 
objects, and if a person puts a hand out in 
front of him, he will try to back away in the 
opposite direction. A lot of people wonder 
how the dog knows where it is going. Phil 
says that its up to him to become familiar 
with places, and then he commands the dog 
in the direction he should move. Through 
routine, Orlan becomes familiar with Phils 
schedule and automatically goes places 
unless Phil directs him otherwise. If, by 
chance, Phil and Orlan get disoriented, they 
simply ask someone where they are. The dog 
is also a good companion to Phil, in fact, 
they live together in an apartment on 
Morewood Ave.
Phil says that hes used to living alone, 
since his parents went away a lot when he 
was younger. When Phil was five years old, 
he learned to take care of himself, and now 
hes accustomed to his independence. He says 
that a roommate would be an impedi
ment to him because a blind person needs 
to know exactly where everything is and 
because he needs total concentration while 
studying.
Phils average day is very busy: He gets up 
at 6 a.m., walks and feeds Orlan, takes a 
shower, and makes his bed. At seven, he calls 
security and they have a shuttle pick him up 
on Centre Ave. Then Phil goes to Kiltie for 
breakfast, where someone helps him select 
his food and carries his tray. He goes to 
Calculus until 9:30 and then walks back 
home to listen to tapes of his books. He is 
back at school for his 11:30 Economics Class, 
has lunch, and lets Orion run free on the 
cut. He has History, and a reader in the 
afternoon. Phils readers are usually CMU 
students who volunteer to read him han
douts, assignments, and other printed 
materials.
Most of Phils books are taped and he says 
this can be a problem. When a sighted per
son reads a boring book and falls asleep, he 
wakes up where he left off. But for Phil, fall
ing asleep during a tape is bothersome 
because the tape runs through until the end, 
and Phil must start again at the beginning. 
Phil also tapes all of his class notes. Since 
almost all of Phils study is done orally, 
his retention capabilities are better than 
most sighted peoples; he cant be distracted 
by other sights, and therefore, concentrates 
on the materials alone. Most teachers have 
agreed to let Phil take tests orally. However, 
in those cases where a written answer is need
ed, Phil brings both a reader and a scribe 
to the test; the reader reads the question, 
and the scribe writes down Phils answers. 
For paper writing, Phil uses a typewriter or 
his new PC. with a voice synthesizer, which 
tells Phil when hes made spelling errors.
Phil feels that his blindness is not a great 
handicap. His attitude towards his blindness 
is surprisingly optimistic. He says that it 
slows him down, but it doesnt stop him. Phil 
feels that everyone has a handicap or pro
blem of one sort, and that just because his 
is physical hes not angry or bitter. Phil 
speaks of the advantages of being blind, I 
use my other senses. If everyone could lose 
their sight for just one week theyd appreciate 
things more. I lived in a small neighborhood 
for eleven years and it was getting boring. 
When I lost my sight, I went around and ex
perienced my surroundings in a new way. It 
was an adventure.
Phil is more active than most people; hes 
an outdoorsy person who likes to try new 
things. Phil enjoys rock climbing, hiking up 
Sugarloaf Mountain, and white water raf
ting. In fact, Phil helped teach a course in 
white water rafting; he showed other
students how to tie complicated knots by 
closing their eyes and feeling the ropes on 
top of each other. Phil is also interested in 
skydiving. Isnt he afraid? No, he says, 
since I cant see how far up I am.
Phil says that its natural for people to 
hesitate around him, but he wants people 
to come up and talk. He often makes blind 
people jokes to lighten the atmosphere with 
people hes just met. Im not made of glass, 
you know. I like to rough house. Phil plays 
frisbee with a beeping disk, he likes to cook, 
go rollerskating, and ride a double bike. He 
goes to movies, parties, and watches T. V. 
Theres not a lot that Phil doesnt do.
As far as social life goes, Phil doesnt like 
huge parties, he does, however, like to hang 
out with groups of ten or twelve people. Phil 
says that meeting people at CMU has been
made easier with Orlan, I meet a lot of peo
ple, they just come up and ask questions 
about the dog and we make friends. He also 
meets people through his scribes and 
readers. Phils last girlfriend was at the Com
munity College. But Phil says that he doesnt 
want to get stuck in a permanent relation
ship, Dating is more special now because 
I must be attracted to a girls inner personali
ty instead of her looks, so I just want to date.
Phil would like to be considered as an in
spiration to others. As a teacher, he would 
be able to say, Look, if I can do it without 
sight, you certainly can with.
Phil finds that some people are embar
rassed to talk to him because they are scared 
of saying the wrong thing. Phil says this most 
often happens when people say something 
like, I saw you on the cut, or Ill see you 
later. Phil says that he can see, just in a dif
ferent way. Phil is not a formidable 
character, hes happy and very ap
proachable. Dont get fooled into thinking 
that because Phil is blind he is somehow dif
ferent; hes not, hes a regular guy.
Pittsburgh celebrates Carnegie's 150th
By MITCHELL REICHGUT
Tartan Staffwriter
This November 25th will mark the sesquicential anniversary of the birth of An
drew Carnegie; in other words it will be his 
150th birthday. Andrew Carnegie should not 
simply be remembered as the boy who came 
here from Scotland with nothing, grew a 
beard, got rich, and then founded CMU. He 
should be remembered for the great con
tributions he made to Pittsburgh. Not only 
was Carnegie a wealthy steel magnate, he 
was the benefactor of most of this citys 
cultural life as well. He is, of course, respon
sible for founding Carnegie Tech, which is 
now Carnegie-Mellon University. He also 
founded a library, an art museum, and a 
music hall.(All of which supply Pittsburgh 
with a bit of culture and personality.)
To celebrate the birth of the man to whom 
Pittsburgh owes so much, the Carnegie 
Museum, the Carnegie Library, and CMU 
will have a great deal of FREE events going 
on from September through December 
which everyone can enjoy. On September 
28th rain or shine, there will be a Family 
Fling at the Carnegie Complex in Oakland. 
At 9:00 a.m., things will begin at the 
Carnegie Library. Outside of the Carnegie 
Institute, which will open at 10:00, there will 
be a parade, demonstrations, storytellers, 
musicians, dancers, craftsmen, and a Scot
tish shepherd will be on hand with a flock 
of Scottish sheep. There will also be Scot
tish sports events such as a sheath toss, a 
stone put, and a caber toss. The Museum
of Natural History and the Museum of Art 
will open free of charge, and there will be 
a huge cardboard Camegie-Creature, 
(which spectators can help build), a 
childrens room, and food vendors.
Other events at the Museum include The 
1985 Carnegie International Exhibit, (Nov.9 
through Jan. 5, 1986), James Galway and 
members of the Pittsburgh Symphony at the 
Music Hall, (Nov.IS), a one-day stamp col
lection at the Carnegie Library, (Nov.25), 
and Mr. Carnegies Museum (which opens
November 26).
CMU students are doing their share too. 
There will be a CMU Symphony Orchestra 
Concert at 8p.m., Wednesday, Nov.20th at 
the Music Hall. The Camegie-Mellon 
University Trio will also be performing at the 
Music Hall, at 7p.m., Sunday, Nov.24th with 
a champagne reception. On campus, peo
ple can enjoy Andrew Carnegie Illustrations 
at the Ellis Gallery, at CFA from 9a.m. to 
5p.m.,Monday through Friday, Nov. 
18-25th. From Nov.2nd through Dec 22nd,
Mel Bochner Drawings will be on display at 
the Hewlett Gallery in CFA. At the Hunt 
Library, in the Fine and Rare Book Room, 
Andrew Carnegie the Writer Exhibit can be 
seen Monday through Friday, 1:30 to 4:30 
p.m. also, watch out for more up and com
ing student events. Remember, all of these 
events are free, and everyone is welcome to 
enjoy them. If Andy were alive today he 
would want you to take a break and have 
some fun, so go ahead and take advantage 
of the celebration.

Counseling Center offers students help
By ERIKA M. QUIROZ
Tartan Staffwriter
The CMU Counseling Center, located in 
Morewood Gardens, sits like a mother hen 
cooing protectively over her egg of CMU 
students. The Counseling Center offers help 
for a variety of problems. Its main concern 
is the emotional well being of the students. 
Says director Lorrie Rabin, Academics are 
well taken care of. We see ourselves as 
available to people in need of emotional sup
port.
The Counseling Center deals with many 
problems, ranging from depression and anx
iety to difficulties with family and relation
ships. Many students receive counseling due 
to feelings of low self worth and loneliness.
The center also otters many different types 
of counseling. Professionals counsel in
dividuals as well as provide support groups 
focused on particular areas of concern. The 
groups are chosen by talking to students to 
get a sense of their particular needs. A 
Family and Transition group came about 
as a result of requests from students dealing 
with divorce. Other groups are centered 
around stress management, shyness, eating 
problems such as bolemia and anorexia, and

Scotch N Soda, CMUs student theater 
group, announces auditions for their first 
production of the 1985-86 season, a pair of 
one act plays. The plays will run on the

studying skills. They also offer Crisis 
Counseling and have a Crisis Night pro
gram to deal with emergencies and poten
tial suicides.
The Counseling Center came about as a 
result of a growing need for more concen
trated attention on emotional problems. 
Originally, the center was known as the 
Bureau of Measurement and Guidance 
which ran tests on intelligence evaluations, 
aptitude, interest, personality, attitude and 
various other evaluations. The growth of the 
center was also initiated by Student Affairs 
as a need to address the personal needs of 
CMU students.
Besides the individual counseling and 
support groups, the Counseling Center sup
plies workshops for stress managment and 
tutoring sessions which began last year. Last 
year alone they held over 800 tutoring ses
sions which were taught by students who had 
received an A in the particular courses 
This year the tutoring includes eight dif
ferent courses: Calculus I, II, and III, 
Physics, Chemistry, English as a Second 
Language, Economics, Intro to Computing 
Financial Counseling & Academic Writing 
Problems.
In addition to this work, the Counseling 
Center is jointly involved with the Health 
Center. When symptoms of both emotional 
and physical problems are present, the 
students are referred from one to another for 
a more complete diagnosis and treatment. 
They have also worked on Educational Pro
gramming together and plan to do more in 
the future.
The Counseling Center employs a staff of 
three professional level counselors, Lorrie 
Rabin, Roseanne Hickey, and Stewart 
Sadowsky; seven advanced doctoral students, 
Jack Foehl, Kathleen Hoy, Lynne Kalman, 
Michael Lechner, Pat Riccelli and Maria 
Riva; and one counsulting psychiatrist, 
Richard Flemming. Also employed by the 
Counseling Center is secretary Jean Barr, a 
vital figure in the centers outreach. She is 
warm and welcoming and makes students 
feel at ease. Rabin says, It is not hard to 
come here. Jean does a good job of making 
people feel comfortable.
The staff is a truly concerned group of 
people. They make time for all who have the 
need to come. You dont have to be bounc
ing off the walls to come here, Rabin says,
We are available for everyday worries that 
are proving difficult to settle in.
The Center is a very active operation and 
at times there is a waiting list but the staff 
has made changes in structure and employed 
more counselors to reduce the problem. 
Word was getting out about the waiting 
list, says Rabin, but we feel very strongly 
about urging people in need of help to come 
despite the list. We will see people in need 
of immediate help. The center has also in
itiated a fifteen minute intake interview 
where all cases will be given at least fifteen 
minutes time to determine the severity of the 
problem.
The Center does short term work that 
usually does not run over twelve sessions. If 
it is needed, the patient will be referred to 
local professionals at the Psychiatric Hospital 
in Oakland where they have negotiated a 
contract that permits them to refer students 
to the resident staff for little or no fee.
The major concentration of the Counsel
ing Center is not on just counseling but on 
outreach. Says Rabin, We want the students 
to know that they are not alone. Were out 
there.

Yakov Smirnoff on America: What a country!

Yakov Smirnoff: everything you always wanted in a comedian. . .OR ELSE.
Compromising Positions
By AMANDA COHEN
Tartan Staffwriter
Yakov Smirnoff said himself that perfor
ming in Russia insured a captured au
dience. Well, the CMU audience didnt need 
the KGB to tell them to enjoy Fridays show 
in the Skibo Ballroom. Smirnoff captured 
us himself.
Smirnoff began by explaining that he is 
originally from Russia, and has been a com
edian in America for eight years. He then 
answered questions from the enthusiastic au
dience. The questions ranged from what he 
thought of life in America to what he was 
doing after the show.
Most people asked about comparisons 
between the USA and the USSR. One stu
dent wanted to know what sort of commer
cials there were in the Soviet Union. Smir
noff answered first that the majority of the 
commercials were military, as there were no 
brand names to advertise. He described an 
ad in which two soldiers are sitting in a tank. 
The first says, We cant invade any more 
countries, and the other says, How bout 
for a Michelob Light?
There were a few interjections of Russian 
dialogue with some students. Of Russian 
comedy, which is to some a contradiction in 
terms, Smirnoff explained the strict censor
ship held comedians to rigid scripts and 
allowed no improvisation. This leads to an 
absolute lack of audience rapport.
However, this freedom of speech is vital 
to Smirnoffs routine, as he uses the typical 
questions to lead his prepared materials, 
creating the effect of improvisation. Smir
noff said that they do have freedom of 
speech in Russia, but in America you still 
have freedom after speech.
In an interview after the show, Smirnoff 
said that starting out as a comedian in 
Russia is similar to starting out as a come
dian in the United States. Russian comics, 
however, are required to heavily censor their 
own material. You cant be caught dead 
with the wrong material, he said, meaning 
it literally. In a past show at the Iron Horse 
Cafe in Northhampton, Mass., he said that 
the self-censorship, and later censorship by 
the Department of Jokes left little more

One of the greatest musicians of the cen
tury, Issac Stem, took center stage at Heinz 
Hall on Friday. Playing Johannes Brahms 
Violin Concerto, the stout 65 year old 
musical genius played with style and vigor 
that is seldom heard from violinists of any 
age, much less a 50+ year veteran.
The Concerto in D Major for Violin and 
Orchestra was written in 1878. The work, 
written for the great violinist Joseph 
Joachim, was considered a very bright and 
cheerful piece from such a dramatic com
poser as Brahms. Many sections of the piece, 
including the candenzas, were either writ
ten or transcribed by Joachim, a great com
poser in his own right. Joachims original in
terpretation in the cadenza, now the stan
dard, was filled with quick-fingered passages 
that almost contradict the main theme. 
However, Brahms brilliantly finds a way to 
blend these distinct different ideas and came 
out with a fantastic score.
Stern, who has played this piece many 
times, chooses to stay the traditional track 
and play the piece as it was first played by 
Joachim. At times Stern played the soft 
passages a little bit too quietly and slowly, 
but his flawless technique and his many 
years of experience kept his level of playing 
somewhere between great and exceptional. 
The orchestra tended to be a tad overpower
ing in many of the soft sections and the 
woodwinds had a few intonation problems.
than things like fish, the moon, and buttons 
from which to eke out comedic routines.
A good deal of his current material 
centers on the strange, new world he found 
when he came here eight years ago, such as 
small language problems. For example, he 
said that he was surprised to hear the word 
Yup so often, because in Russian it means 
sex. He talked about being confused by see
ing grits on a Southern menu, thinking that 
grits were a part of a womans body (as in: 
Kiss my grits!). Yup.
Smirnoff also cited some of his television 
appearances, including a part on the series 
Night Court and a lite beer commercial (in 
Russia we also have a light beer.. .Everything 
you always wanted in a beer...Or Else. ). His 
movie appearances include Moscow on the 
Hudson, Buckaroo Banzai, and Brewsters 
Millions. In the latter, his one line was his 
repeated catch-phrase for any fascinating 
American peculiarity; What a Country!
Of the Camegie-Mellon crowd, which was 
standing-room-only, he said it was  one of 
the better, intelligent respones. They knew 
when to laugh and when to hiss at all the 
right times. The group also knew what to 
do and the end of the fantastic show; 
everyone gave Smirnoff an enthusiastic stan
ding ovation.
Sam Simon, a native of Pittsburgh, was 
the opening act. Simons act featured stan
dard magic tricks and above-standard au
dience relation, despite the expected 
rudeness. The assistants he volunteered 
nearly stole the show (as well as his magic 
wand) but Simon came away with a good 
deal of the laughs. Interviewed after the 
show, Simon said that he was very happy to 
have been invited. Simon had known Smifnoff before the show, and was delighted to 
open for him and to find such a receptive 
audience.
American life doesnt seem to be treating 
Smirnoff too badly. He recently finished 
filming a movie with Meryl Streep and Jack 
Nicholson called Heartburn. Definitely not 
an opportunity he would have found in the 
U.S.S.R. Is Yakov Smirnoff going to have a 
prosperous future? Yup.
Despite these few flaws, the piece was well 
done and was greeted with a standing ova
tion (the first of the season) by the sold out 
audience.
Before the Brahms concerto, the or
chestra played the Overture to Benvenuto 
Cellini by Hector Berlioz. The Pittsburgh 
Symphony and Berlioz is a great combina
tion, and the orchestra played this peice 
with grace and intensity  as it should be. 
It is a shame that this piece was the only 
scheduled work by Berlioz for the season.
After the intermission the mood took a 
total about-face. Playing Igor Stravinskys in
tense Rite of Spring the orchestra had to 
shift styles from melodic and flowing to 
harsh and jagged. Although the piece is very 
unconventional, it was perfect for the 
dramatic conducting of Christoph Eschenbach. Directing with a firm baton, Eschenbach moved the orchestra through the piece 
masterfully and really gave an excellent per
formance.
The fine performance of Stravinsky piece 
as well as the other works can be attributed 
to the excellent poise of the orchestra, which 
had to traverse both ends of the musical 
spectrum through the concert. Remarkably, 
the orchestra lost very little character in the 
process.
A final note for students ad senior 
citizens: one hour before the performance 
any remaining tickets are just $7, a steal 
considering the world class status of the Pitt
sburgh Symphony.

Dr. Bruce Fleckstein, a successful 
periodontist, puts his patients in Com
promising Positions and uses his Polaroid to 
preserve the memory. When he is suddenly 
murdered, most of the women of 
Shorehaven are suspect.
From this premise springs this quite enterentertaining film by Frank Perry. The amus
ing murder mystery follows Judith Singer, an 
ex-journalist, as she does some investigative 
reporting. She is intrigued by the mystery of 
her gum-surgeons murder and she is bored. 
Her husband is a stuffy, successful lawyer 
who wears a navy three-piece suit and com
mutes by train to the city each day. She shops 
or visits her equally bored friends each day 
as she has for the past seven years. When 
something as exciting as a murder happens 
in her community, she finds herself unable 
to hold back her long dormant instincts as 
a journalist even though her husband is 
strongly against it.

chitecture Studio opens tonight at seven 
p.m. at the Forbes Gallery. The show runs 
through Sunday, September 29.
Waldorf is the collective endeavor of nine 
students: Stephen Scleroff, Rachel ONeill, 
Ira David Bers, Alan Estabrock, Scott Shan
non, Loretta Lung, Jill Watson, Joe Basipio, 
and Lew Korczinewsky. They were all
flict that her character feels over the choice 
between scooping the story and being the 
wife that her husband wants her to be. Her 
performance has a kind of familiarity about 
ither Judith is straight from the pages of 
an L.L. Bean catalogand it goes over well.
Raul Julia, quite busy these days with Kiss 
of the Spider Woman as well as Compromis
ing Positions, provides us with a really strong 
performance as the homicide detective who 
investigates Fleckstein s murder and Judiths 
emotions. His character comes through most 
strongly, showing himself as a truly talented 
actor.*
Once again, Edward Herrmann shines in 
a supporting role. This time, he is wonder
ful as Judith's husband. He has lately been 
proving himself a solid actor in memorable 
supporting roles. Most recently, the brightest 
character in this summers The Man with 
One Red Shoe was his CIA apprentice to 
Charles Duming.
Compromising Positions isnt the greatest 
film, but it is an amusing and suspenseful 
mystery with some fine performances.

with you. A bit drawn out, its still funny.
Yoda, a classic cut from way back when, 
finally appears on an album. This song has 
the unique potential to tick off both Star 
Wars freaks and Kinks fans alike. This song 
is good and strange; for some reason Als 
voice doesnt sound too awful here. Turning 
a classic rock song into a ballad about train
ing to be a Jedi Knight is a bit stupid, but 
keep in mind that A1 put the sick into the 
word classic(k).
Another great bit here is the performance 
of George of the Jungle theme: yes, that 
old cartoon that was more than a little 
bizarre. Backed by an encore performance 
by the original George (Bill Scotti) this 
popped-up version of the theme for an ecclectic cartoon series fits in well with all the 
other stuff on the album. What more needs 
to be said... .art for arts sake must inevitably 
be followed with silliness just for the heck 
of it.
Another original tune is Slime Creatures 
From Outer Space. I didnt like this one  it 
doesnt seem funny so much as it is just 
weird, and a bit hyperactive now and then. 
Ive heard funnier cuts than this in the same 
style done by the Flying Lizards, and I dont 
even like them. So there.
Girls Just Wanna Have Lunch is another 
well done parody, though Als voice hits the 
ol cellar in terms of listenability again. Some 
really disgusting sounds of people eating 
lunch give this number the weirdness we all 
expect, along with Als apparent fascination 
with food. A good song, and quite funny.
band Dare to be Stupid
By ERIK HARE
Tartan Staffwriter
Would you believe that Weird A1 
Yankovic was valedictorian of his high school 
class? This is in fact the same Weird Al 
whose new album, Dare to be Stupid, has 
little trouble living up its name. Some real
ly stupid tracks here. But dont get me 
wrong: its just as hilarious as his other stupid 
stuff, only now hes admitting something.
Judging by the album, his tour with The 
Stupid Band (which comes to the Graffiti 
this Wednesday) should prove to be quite 
outrageous. This album contains not only 
the good-natured parodies of pop muzak for 
which he is famous but also a whole mess 
of originals of the 11 cuts on the album, 
only four are parodies, while five are 
originals, rounded out by an old favorite of 
the cartoon set and the obligitory Hooked 
on Polkas. Al seems to really be into new 
creations these days, since this trend is pro
gressing from his last album, Weird Al in 
3-D: and judging by the contents of these 
songs, Als creative genius for pure silliness 
is unparalleled.
The first song on the album is the nowfamous Like a Surgeon. This song, while 
incredibly funny the first time through, got 
quickly on my nerves because the 
background thumping, true to the original, 
is just so booorrrring. With pop music like 
this being in fashion, the Weird Ones move 
to original music makes a lot of sense. Like 
a Surgeon is just as stupid as the original, 
but much, much sillier.
Dare to be Stupid, the second song, is 
more than a bit new wave for my tastes, 
although my tastes are too ecclectic to put 
in print. Al sounds like hes smoked a whole 
lid the way he shouts out the lyrics to this 
original and weird cut.
Without much doubt, the stupidest (and 
thereby the funniest) song on the album is 
the third, I Wanna New Duck. A lot of 
tired cliches turned into duck jokes makes 
for a song that left me gasping for breath 
and turning blue, since laughing and 
breathing tend to be mutually exclusive. The 
wonderful lyrics are accented by the 
perpetual sounds of (sort of) grown men 
quacking out-of-key melodies. Truly eccen
tric, but great.
If Like a Surgeon doesnt prove that 
Weird Al has the worst voice ever, the 
fourth song, One More Minute definitely 
does. Al wrote this slow ballad as perhaps 
the perfect way to tell someone to go away: 
Id rather spend eternity eating shards of 
broken glass/Than spend one more minute

THIS BUD'S
INA MNEO
By DR. CALIGARI
Special to The Tartan
The 1980s music scene has largely been 
composed of revivals of past movements  
rockabilly, mod, and now psychedelic to 
name a few. On the forefront of music to
day is the upcoming revival of glam. Glam 
was a movement in the early 1970s and in
cluded such artists as David Bowie, T. Rex, 
and Roxy Music. As in all revivals, the 
original music is gaining in popularity and 
new bands are recreating the feeling while 
adding new, updated touches. A case in 
point is the emergence of The Glam Slam 
as one of THE clubs to go to in Los Angeles. 
It plays all glam music and the crowd dresses 
in an updated glam style. As for new glam 
bands, one of the best is the Jacobites. Their 
album Robespierres Velvet Basement sounds 
a lot like very early Bowie and also T. Rex.
It conjures up a lot of atmosphere  not 
atmosphere in the Tangerine Dream sense,
but atmosphere in the recreation of an era. 
The singer sounds a lot like Bob Dylan and 
the music is electrified folk with a rock edge. 
It is very much in the tradition of Bowies 
Hunky Dory album. Big Store is one of the 
more electrified songs on the album and is 
very similar in feel to T. Rex. Fortune Of 
Fame includes a harmonica (pretty novel 
among all the synthesizers being used today). 
Most of the album is composed of slower 
songs and two that stand out are Where the 
Rivers End and Ambulance Station. All in 
all its a really good album  different from 
most of the music coming out now and very 
tied to the early glam tradition.
New singles:Worse Than You b/w Like 
a Soldier from Life After Death. Worse 
Than You is a mild garage snarl over swirl
ing music replete with the now-uncommon 
handclaps and tambourine. Like a Soldier 
has catchy hooks and is very much Southern
psychedelic.
Wild as Soul b/w Such a Mystery from 
Hysteric Narcotics. These are true hipsters. 
As they say right on the groovy op-art pic
ture sleeve: recorded in Hysterasound.
Wild as Soul has a real 60 s feel to it while 
Such a Mystery combines a cool organ and 
one of the most memorable opening lines 
(Shes got spyglasses / glued to her 
eyelashes) to come up with a bouncy sound.

and learn trades. To do this, the school 
followed Steiners philosophy that the entire 
body and all the senses should be used as a 
learning tool, and so instituted a curriculum 
of eurythimics. The children were taught to 
see things as a whole, not just as outer ap
pearances.
The project which is on display this week 
is in two phases. In the first phase, the ar
chitects used a subtractive process: 
theoretically given an enormous lump of 
sandstone, they were told to subtract the liv
ing spaces from the piece of sandstone as a 
whole. To illustrate their work they were on
ly allowed to use 8V X 11 pieces of paper, 
which they taped together. The space of the 
school is depicted in charcoal air drawings, 
where the deeper the areas got, the darker 
the charcoal that was used to shade them. 
In the second phase, the architects were on
ly allowed to use prismacolor pencils on 
brown paper, and the only materials they 
were allowed to use in the design were wood 
and brick.
The Forbes Gallery is open Wednesday 
through Friday, 11 a.m.-6p.m., and Satur
day and Sunday, 12 p.m.-5 p.m.
continued from page 10
For the movie Johnny Dangerously, 
Weird Al got to do his first sountrack cut. 
This is the Life is a cute piece, but not that 
remarkably funny or strange. From a rather 
bad flick comes this basically average song.
For the upwardly mobile among us, the 
original song Cable TV has a nice pop feel 
that fits in well with this message. 
Guaranteed as a hit song among the 
bourgeois people who think of fun as com
paring VCRs in major shopping malls, this 
song is an (almost) true-to-life picture of the 
meaning of cable: I got the Siamese Faith 
Healers Network / The news and weather 
from Peru / I got celebrity hockey / The raquetball channel too. I got... I got. Al is 
making a point, and I like it.
All of this is backed up by the fine accordian work in the obligatory Hooked on
Polkas. With Top-40 stuff like DuranDuran, Yes, and Nenas Neun und Neunzig Luftballoonen (Ja, es ist auf Deutsch) 
being put into polka form...well...you know. 
Its stupid. But as Al said, I want to be there 
when the accordian takes over the rock world 
and becomes the no. 1 rock instrument. Im 
telling you, in a few years, the electric guitar 
will be obsolete. Luckily, Im on the forefront 
of the accordian rock movement. OK Al: 
we understand.

The CMU cross-country team par
ticipated in the Indiana University Invita
tional this past Saturday. A total of 25 teams 
participated and CMU, led by Pat Noll and 
Marc Sulecki, was the top finisher of the five 
Division III teams. However the larger divi
sion I schools proved to be out of our 
league.
Commenting on the match, Coach Gary 
Meckley mentioned that the running con
ditions were less than ideal. It was very hot 
which made running the hilly course even 
more grueling. He also mentioned that the
field was tremendous and included a cou
ple of olympians.
He said that an occasional invitational of 
this kind is good for bringing the team, 
which has had outstanding success against 
other Division III schools, down to earth. He 
also said that there arent many invitationals 
which present the level of competition which 
would be best for the team. The smaller in
vitationals often only involve Division III 
schools and dont present enough compete 
tion. In the larger invitationals, we get 
outclassed by the Division I schools which 
can attract runners with full scholarships.

Tartan Editor-in-Chief
The CMU Tartans continued their 
undefeated season by dominating the John 
Carroll University Blue Streaks, 35-0, this 
past Saturday in Cleveland.
Fighting a possible letdown after last 
weeks upset of Bucknell, CMU executed 
their offense and defense in a businesslike 
fashion. The offensive line blew open big 
holes for hard-running Vic Boland (95 yards 
on 15 carries) and Mike Minjock (57 yards 
on 10 carries).
The Blue Streaks lost leading rusher Brad 
Cantwell to graduation from last year, and 
their offense has not recovered. Freshman 
quarterback, Don Stupica, could not get 
their offense moving, and the runners gain
ed just 42 yards, compared to CMUs 273 
yards. Their program, which looked strong 
last year, has problems now.
Against some of the lesser teams, its hard 
to get emotionally fired up. But just like [in 
1983], we went out and worked hard and 
won the game, said strong safety and cocaptain Brad Sherwin.
The Tartans got on the scoreboard early 
in the first quarter. After a seven yard punt 
return by Joe Orlowski to midfield, CMU 
moved 50 yards in 11 plays. Junior quarter
back Mike Hensel (seven completions in nine 
attempts for 86 yards, one touchdown, and 
one interception) threw a 17 yard pass to 
sophomore halfback Darin Ball on a key 
third-and-nine situation from the John Car
roll 49, and later hit Minjock for a one-yard 
touchdown pass on fourth down. Sophomore 
kicker, Mike Nazzdro missed the extra point, 
due to a bad snap, but the Tartans were 
ahead to stay, 6-0.
The Blue Streaks fell victim to many miss
ed tackles and the powerful CMU running 
game. Tech had 273 yards rushing, giving 
them 796 yards total rushing in their three 
games. A 21-yard run by Boland typified the 
entire game. Boland broke a tackle at the 
line, was hit by three secondary men whom 
he dragged ten yards before being tackled.
After a one-yard TD run by Hensel to put 
CMU ahead 14-0, reserve quarterback, Joe 
Mollica went to work late in the second 
quarter. Hensel had to leave the game with 
a slightly injured ankle. The Tartans drove 
89 yards on 12 plays, culminating in a 
26-yard pass from Mollica to Richards, the 
play of Mollica, who had 82 total offensive 
yards, and Nick Klipa (four of five for 48 
yards) proved the tremendous depth CMU
has at the QB position, as well as experience. Darin Ball (6) finds a hole between guards David Merrigan (67) and Ed Gallagher (76). 
Hensel is a junior, while Klipa and Mollica
are both seniors.
There were a couple of bright spots for 
JCU. Linebacker Joe Burrello tied a school 
record with 22 tackles, and Stupica com
pleted 14 out of 23 passes in his first start. 
The Streaks only threatened twice, but were 
thwarted early by an interception by Joe 
Orlowski on the three yard line and stopped 
late by three pass deflections by Dan 
Preston. Andy James also had an intercep
tion for CMU.
Tartan Tattlers--The Tartans take on the 
Hiram Terriers Saturday at Tech Field. 
Game time is at 1:30 p.m., and the game 
will be covered on WRCT 
(88.3)...sophomore Billy Cramer returned 
a kickoff 69 yards to set up CMUs fourth 
touchdown...Billy Heiser caught his first two 
passes of his career after switching to split 
end from defensive back.

Coach Jane Fisk commented that she was 
rather worried about this match in par

school with twice as many students to choose 
from as Camegie-Mellon. After all the worry 
the team played very well. The outside hit

lived up to the confidence placed in her by 
being team captain, by doing an excellent

The team, again, played well with attack 
based on hard hits. Captain Marianne Smith 
again showed her ability by doing a great 
job of setting and at times surprising the op
ponents by hitting instead of setting.
Coach Fisk commented that the team is 
improving with every match. She believes the 
real test will come when the lady Tartans 
play their first Conference match.

Come in, I can help!" says the sign on 
the door. And its true. E.J. Birdy, the man 
behind the sign, helped 2915 students par
ticipate in intramural sports last year.
2915 individual students. 5012 total entries.
If Mr. Birdy hadnt offered 
t documentation, I wouldnt have/(V'believed him. Who would thinkGwthat so many people could join 
together to participate in a single activity in 
a school as segmented as CMU?
Its not really a single activity, though. 
The departments 1985-6 schedule lists 36 
different sports, 15 in the fall and 21 in the 
spring. They run the gamut from touch foot
ball to darts, and include such diverse of
ferings as chess (pencil neck geeks take note) 
and water polo.
Even E.J. Birdy seems a little impressed. 
When I go to the intramural convention, 
people at other schools go bananas when 
they see our numbers. We might have the 
best Division III IM program in the country.
Why do people participate in IM sports? 
After all, isnt CMU made up mostly of 
pencil-necked geeks and flaky dramats? One

major reason is the fraternities. All eleven 
campus greek organizations have at least one 
team participating in touch football. But the 
fraternities account for only 15 percent of 
the students on campus. Why do the rest 
play?
Birdy offers several answers. First, most of 
the students live on campus, giving the IM 
department a large pool of elegible bodies 
looking for entertainment. Intramurals can 
also serve an outlet for frustration, or a sim
ple study break. Each of the intramural 
events is structured to last about an hour, 
so a student can be back to the dorm in less 
than an hour and a half, explains Birdy.
The social aspect as a reason for par
ticipation isnt neglected, either. While an 
indoor soccer match doesnt exactly function 
as an athletic singles bar, it does provide a 
chance to meet people you wouldnt or
dinarily come into contact with. Social
animals note, however: 165 of the S53 Corec volleyball players are female.
In fact, females now have their own IM 
director, Gerri Siedl, who is also the womens 
basketball coach. Ladies, however, are 
welcome to participate in any and all mens 
activities. But now look for more female only 
events and a greater push to get women 
involved.
All indications point toward the fact that 
the IM program is growing and will continue 
to grow at least as rapidly. This expansion 
places the sole cloud on the IM horizon: the 
need for more facilities. The IM teams must 
share their fields, which varsity teams often 
use for practice grounds. But where to put 
a new field? If you have a solution, call x2214 
and ask for E.J. Hell be glad you called.

Editorial.?i
Student voice 
must be loud 
to be heard
In recent weeks The Tartan has printed 
editorials focusing on a lack of communication 
on the part of the administration when dealing 
with the student body. We have stated that on 
many issues, the administration has acted without 
consulting the students. However, the blame 
should not be placed solely on the administra
tion. With a population of approximately six 
thousand people, the student body has shown lit
tle effort in letting the administration know how 
it feels.
Lets face it, when we as students arrive at 
Carnegie-Mellon we expect someone to pander 
to our needs, while we dont often think about 
the particulars of solving problems. Because we 
pay a lot of money to attend school we expect 
many things, and if our expectations are not met, 
we complain. We complain to each other, we 
complain to our friends. But we rarely complain 
to the right people.
The student body, as a whole, doesnt take any 
initiative in dealing with issues they should care 
about. Do you care? In this issue of The Tartan 
there is not one letter to the editor, and only one 
student-produced opinion in the entire 
newspaper. How can we expect the administra
tion to hear our voice if we have nothing to say?
There are exceptions,such as Student Govern
ment President Karen Lee. Lee is working with 
each administrator to set up office hours when 
he/she would be available to talk with students. 
But if the administrators were to set up hours, 
and no one goes to talk to them, Karen Lees ef
fort will be fruitless.
Student Senate is another exception. Chairman 
Michel Bett and his fellow senators have had an 
excellent success ratio in solving problems 
brought before the senate, yet one always hears 
people say that Student Senate never gets 
anything done. How can Senate solve a problem 
that isnt brought before it.
The administration has recently attempted to 
improve lines of communication. When students 
have had questions, they get explanations, if not 
answers. Fred Rogers answered questions about 
the proposed hotel at last weeks senate meeting. 
Senior Vice President John P. Crecine has, for this 
issue, written an extensive viewpoint on many 
topics. In recent weeks, when asked about many 
things, the administration has been answering.
Ladies and gentlemen, now it is your turn. 
Speak out on what is bothering you. Speak out 
on issues you think are important. Read Dr. 
Crecine s column, and tell us what you think. Tell 
Dr. Crecine what you think. Tell Dr. Cyert, tell 
Student Senate, tell someone your opinion. You 
may be surprised at the result.
A body with six thousand voices should not be 
silent. It should scream.
Hoff writes letter to Cyert
.cr
by Michael Hoff
Dear President Cyert,
This is my fourth year here. It 
seems like yesterday I moved into 
my freshman dorm. And it seems 
like it was a totally different school 
back then.
Somewhere along 
the line, something 
went wrong. You 
decided to give CMU a jump on 
the future- P.C.s, IBM- thats old 
news. But you cheated a lot of 
students in doing so. While compsci students received more than 
enough printing and computing 
time, the H&SS (especially 
English) people had their ac
counts taken away. We lost our 
computer access so people could 
play Dragon Slayer. The P.C.s 
came to the rescue a year later, 
but while comp-sci people have 
access to free and ample materials 
we were struck with a five dollar 
English class handout fee. I guess 
our tuition hikes werent enough 
to cover that.
You thought the IBM deal was 
the best for the school. I believe 
it was. I really do handled poor
ly, but still a good move. But be
ing good wasnt enough. We had 
to look good at all costs. You 
jumped on the get-tough-withfraternities band wagon. When 
one frat bacame a blemish in the 
publics eye, they all paid. Rush 
was shortened, the alcohol policy 
became more strict and now their 
parties are being raided to ap
pease local residents. That makes 
you look good to them. What 
about the Greeks? They would 
have had to cover the cost of the 
vacant house had the freshmen 
not been moved in. They wouldnt 
have had any choice, eitheryou 
own their houses. But, they were 
spared. You actually made 
freshmen move into that house. It 
was nearly ruined over the sum
mer and is still in poor shape. I 
knowwe needed housing. So 
why not use Morewood lot for 
some sort of student housing? 
Which do we need more  a dorm 
or a hotel? I guess it came down 
to a choice make the students 
happy or make Oakland, Pitt, or 
local hospitals happy. Guess who 
lost.
I cant argue about what the 
DOD will do at SEI because I
dont know enough. Do you? All 
I know is that well have an arm
ed forces higher-up on the board. 
How much thought will he give to 
the students?
I tried to meet with you once. 
The reason is not important. I 
couldnt get past your secretary." 
She referred me to Dean Braden 
Walters. Why couldnt I see you? 
I was just a student from a group 
you had no time for.
Impersonal. That is what CMU 
has becomea small school too 
busy to notice the people here. 
But to an outside observer, we 
look good. Damned good. So do 
you.
I could go on, but Ill keep thig 
shortpartially because Im sure 
youre busy, and partially because
I know that nothing I say will 
change anything at all. I wont ap
pear on T.V., I dont represent a 
corporation. I wont help profess 
the technical, industrial, and 
regional advances your school is 
making.
No. Im just a student.

Why a Student Senator?
By Michael Bett 
Sometimes I really wonder why 
I am a Student Senator.
Students at CMU hold the view 
that the faculty and administra
tion are going to do what they 
want to do when they
want to do it. So in
stead of complaining 
and getting something 
done about the problem, students 
grin and bear it.
The funny thing is that the 
faculty and administration really 
do care.
Once the administration 
realizes that they have done or are
about to do something that will 
inconvenience the students, they 
do their best to correct the situa
tion. First they must be contacted. 
Contrary to popular belief, nine 
out of ten administrators are not 
telepathic.
This brings me back to my 
original question. Why am I a 
Student Senator? Student Senators 
are a strange breed. We care 
enough at CMU to bring about 
change; and we know how to do 
it. Yet students seldom bother to 
complain, so many problems are 
not brought to Senates attention. 
By giving us your favorite gripes,
we can work to solve them.
Just in the past two weeks, Stu
dent Sentate requested that Clyde 
Street residents, be given priority 
on the parking list and that the 
Hunt library study rooms be 
reopened. Both requests were 
granted. Making the administra
tion aware of these problems 
made them disappear.
What does it all mean? Does 
our Student Senate really have the 
ability to solve our problems and 
improve campus life? Actually, we 
dont. That is, not unless you want 
us to. Like it or not, were your

September 24,1985The TartanPage 19
Administrative view
responds to criticism of prioritiesSenior VP
By John P. Crecine
The first two issues of the Tartan this year 
contain many references to and criticisms of 
the Universitys priorities in capital expen
ditures. These criticisms are also reflected 
in my own conversations with students and,
often, with faculty. Most recently
v6^ the focus of the criticism has VC*09 been the construction of the
Software Engineering Institute 
Building, plans for a university conference 
center, and parking problems exacerbated 
by both. Construction delays for Scotland 
Yard, the new, student-run pub in Skibo and 
a plan to shift student study space from one 
part of the Hunt Library to another, add to 
the stack of complaints.
Many of the specific criticisms reflect 
misinformation concerning a project or a 
misunderstanding of whose resources are be
ing allocated to particualr projects, and the 
constraints on particular resources. There is 
an underlying theme in many of the 
criticisms that is essentially accurate and 
where criticism of the University and the 
priorities revealed through its actions may 
have justification.
Before turning to what I see as the essen
tial underlying issue how resources are 
allocated at Carnegie-Mellon, reflecting 
what priorities, and to whose benefit?let 
me be defensive, as befits an administrator 
and faculty member when talking to 
students. Why are people so paranoid? A re
cent version of the campus Master Plan 
shows a student housing complex across 
from the Cut on the other side of Forbes, 
roughly where ATO and SAE fraternities are 
located. This is cited as the central ad
ministrations desire to get rid of fraternities, 
or at minimum, our failure to appreciate 
fraternities contributions to campus life. 
The same master plan showed Forbes 
Avenue and Frew Street as vacated by the 
City, the Naval Reserve Building on Forbes 
gone, and a host of new buildings a 
university center complex, several new 
research buildings, fountains, plazas, etc. 
Did the mayor of Pittsburgh or the Chief of 
Naval Operations sit-in in Warner Hall? 
Cant students take a joke? The fact of the 
matter is that we would like to see, thirty 
years from now, a campus not split by a ma
jor thoroughfare (Forbes) and we do see 
limits to the useful life of several of the 
buildings in which fraternities are housed. 
A Master Plan, if useful, provides a com
prehensive framework for thinking about in
dividual projects, so that cumulative effects 
of a series of separate construction or renova
tion projects add up to a coherent whole. To 
be comprehensive, one needs a 30-50 year 
view, not a five to ten year view. The reader 
can provide his or her own list of CamegieMellon buildings that should have been con
ceived in a broader context.
Again being defensive, the SEI and the 
conference center have been cited by some 
as evidence of the Universitys insatiable ap
petite for prominence and prestige and 
image if you allow me the choice of the 
image to be projected, I gladly plead guilty 
to having such an appetite for the Universi
ty. One editorial and a few letters suggest 
that the conference center and SEI were im
portant fulfillments of President Cyerts ego 
needs. I can assure you that there are a lot 
of easier ways to satisfy egos, even those as 
modestly-sized as Dick Cyerts, than putting 
up buildings. To administrators with ex
perience, buildings are headaches, not ego 
trips! In fact the University is becoming more 
prominent, more involved in the world out
side of Schenley Park and Pittsburgh, and 
decidedly less parochial. From a strictly 
selfish point of view, the University is the 
more interesting for it.
A slightly more subtle defensive posture 
that the administration could take is to point 
out that the recent capital projects that 
students are most aware of were due either 
to unique opportunities (the University 
Computer Center Building and the IBM 
project), or were paid for by someone else  
the SEI building and the conference center 
are built with non-University resources (DoD 
and private investors), at no risk to the 
University, and will provide net returns to us.
The response to all of these comments is 
likely to be something like we agree with 
all of that, but where do students fit in? 
What is the University doing for students? 
The defense would respond with a list of 
large and small items from Morewood 
Gardens renovations several years ago to a 
doubling of the classroom renovation fund, 
a $150,000 contribution to the student pub, 
renovation of major art and design studio
space in the College of Fine Arts, etc.
There is a deeper underlying issue and 
criticism. Let me try to phrase it. CarnegieMellon has developed great research and 
academic programs. The excellence of these 
programs are why we (faculty as well as 
students) are here. But, the University never 
seems to want to do anything for students 
that affects life outside of the classroom (or 
for faculty unless it is directly related to 
sponsored research). Whenever there is a 
hard choice or a trade off to be made, it 
always seems to be made in support of 
research activities and excellence in areas 
of little direct benefit to students. Take, for 
example, the University Computer Center 
building, the Software Engineering Institute, 
and the Conference Center. Even if these 
projects dont always use University 
resources, they do require a great amount 
of administrative and faculty attention to 
bring off. In the UCCB, SEI, and Con
ference Center, the University has shown that 
it can act quickly, effectively, and flexibly. 
It can mobilize considerable administrative 
talents and exhibit great entrepeneurial 
competence in the pursuit of research and 
intellectual objectives. Why cant those 
talents be mobilized to do something equally 
dramatic and beneficial for students? It is 
not that we are opposed to computing, the 
SEI, or the Conference Center, it is simply 
that our needs never seem to get attacked 
with the same intensity as the other, 
legitimate needs of the University.
This general argument is difficult to 
refute, because much of it is true. Why? Is 
it because the University administration and 
faculty dont really give a damn for students? 
No, of course not. Carnegie-Mellon students 
get one of the finest undergraduate educa
tions available anywhere at any cost. Near
ly all faculty are personally committed to ex
cellence in education and deliver in the 
classroom. This is an institution that cares 
deeply about undergraduate education and 
has made great contributions, locally and 
nationally from the Carnegie Plan that 
included the liberal arts as an integral part 
of a professional education in the 1940s, to 
the H&SS core curriculum in the 1970s, to 
the emerging University core and integration 
of computing into education in the 1980s.
It is not a lack of concern for students on 
the part of the administration and faculty 
that accounts for the fact that student 
facilities have not kept pace with the 
research and academic facilities at Carnegie - 
Mellon. The two most important factors ac
counting for these problems relate not to the 
priorities and motivations of the central ad
ministration or faculty, but to the availability 
of monies for capital items and buildings, 
and to the way the internal resource alloca
tion process works.
To begin with, there is no regular source, 
for any purpose, of capital funds for private 
universities. The sources of capital funds for 
universities like Camegie-Mellon have pretty 
much dried up in the past fifteen years. 
Unlike public institutions, we have no state 
legislature to provide a regular capital 
budget. The Federal government no longer 
provides special interest rate subsidies (so we
can borrow) or direct capital grants to 
private universities. Unlike the 1960s, most 
corporate and public foundations no longer 
make grants for brick and mortar items to 
universities. Corporations and foundations 
make grants to research projects or endow
ment, but not to universities for buildings. 
To the extent any funds are available for 
buildings, they are tightly tied to specific 
research activities and facilities to support 
them. In response to this, the University has 
begun to transfer significant amounts of its 
operating income to capital (roughly 18% for 
this fiscal year). This is no regular pipeline 
of capital funds from the outside world to 
a private university at all, let alone a pipeline 
into student projects.
The normal resource allocation process 
works, in subtle ways, to fund many of those 
projects that are first on one groups priori
ty list and tenth on everyones elses. The pro
cess makes it difficult to fund any of those 
projects that are second or third on 
everybodys priority list, but first on no ones. 
This tendency, coupled with a clear strategic 
focus in the university and the power of the 
component academic departments E&CE, 
Biology, or Psychology  will be funded 
before university-wide projects that everyone 
is favorably disposed toward, but not as pas
sionately so as a department head or dean 
concerning his/her pet project. Then there 
is the question of scale  $500K to $2 million 
projects are far easier to swallow than one,
Opinion Policy

of The Tartan Editorial Board.

large $5 $20 million project and can be fold
ed into existing budgets with less disruption. 
While this characterization of the capital 
resource allocation process is not entirely ac
curate, it does describe some central 
tendencies.
Take this allocation mechanism, dry up 
outside sources of capital, put it in a setting 
where people (faculty and administration) 
are rewarded for innovation and intellectual 
entrepeneurship and hard work, let the 
mechanism run for 20 years, and the results 
will not be too different from what we 
observe around us. . .a refurbished E&CE 
facility, new space for Statistics and 
Psychology, expensive wet labs for Biology, 
Chemistry, and Chemical Engineering, 
renovation in Fine Arts associated with 
research or educational innovations, 
campus-wide computer network (that will 
include every student residence), etc. What 
you also see are 65-year old athletic facilities, 
rock-strewn play fields, the best student 
lounge on campus on the first floor of the 
library, and a spartan student center, 
Skibo. The lack of outside capital resources 
and the nature of resource allocation in a 
human organization, where faculty with 
focused research interests have significant 
power, conspire to produce an under supp
ly of central facilities  those things that the 
majority of people in the university com
munity use.
Camegie-Mellon is, first an foremost, an 
academic institution. Our first priority has 
to be that of creating and supporting ex
cellence in our academic programs, be they 
educational or research. Any viable long
term strategy must attend to academic needs 
first. The University has done precisely that 
over the past fifteen years, in a systematic 
and very effective way. Carnegie-Mellon is 
one of two or three elite institutions whose 
stature has increased dramatically during 
the past decade. We are not going to stop 
doing those things that have been so suc
cessful in the past. Yet there are gaps to be 
filled and improvements to be made.
It was the realization that the available 
flows of capital resources and our normal

allocation processes would not by themselves 
produce the kind of university we want that 
caused us, nearly two years ago, to begin to 
lay the ground work for a capital campaign 
for Carnegie Mellon. The ground work in
cluded an update of the Universitys Strategic 
Plan, a $200 million capital program to sup
port the plan ($100 million for physical 
facilities and $100 million for increased en
dowment), the campus Master Plan to sup
port the physical facilities component of the 
capital program, and the other organiza
tions and materials necessary for a successful 
fund drive. Once the campaign plan, Master 
Plan, and capital program is presented to 
the Board next month, we will begin 
meeting with faculty and students to present 
the same information.
There are many student-oriented items 
in the Capital Campaign. Some, such as stu
dent housing modernization, classroom 
renovation, educational facilities, and 
educational equipment, represent expansion
of what we are already doing on a modest 
level. Two issues of direct concern to students 
were and remain at the very top of the 
priority list for the capital campaign: in
creased endowment for student financial 
aid, and a new University Center.
The need for increased financial aid is ob
vious, as federal student support declines 
and as the cost of supporting an aid-blind 
admissions policy increases with tuition 
costs. The need for a University Center is no 
less obvious. The University Center is to con
sist of a student center (a totally renovated, 
re-skinned, and reconfigured Skibo), an 
athletic and recreation center between the 
student center and the football stadium (raquet courts, exercise rooms, indoor track, 
50-meter pool, lockers, with tennis courts on 
the roof), and a renovation of the existing 
gymnasium for basketball, volleyball, etc. In 
spite of the best efforts of many people, 
Skibo does not represent the kind of facility 
that the campus needs. Neither does the cur
rent gymnasium building. Some facilities are
totally lacking, and in many areas there are 
too few facilities and too little space to fill 
campus (students, faculty, and staff) needs.
While there is no such thing as unanimi
ty in any interesting organization, something 
close to that exists in the administration con
cerning the appropriateness of the inclusion 
of the University Center in the capital cam
paign and the need to implement the plans 
for the Center as soon as possible. I know 
we have internal plans, targets, and 
deadlines and that the President, Vice 
President for Development, the Vice Presi
dent for Business Affairs, the Planning 
Director, and I all agree the University 
Center should be first. Now all we need is 
the rest of the world to cooperate (and give).
In summary, I think there is a legitimate 
underlying criticism of priorities as reveal
ed by the Universitys actions. There are ex
planations for these actions that have 
nothing to do with a lack of concern for stu
dent needs. There are moves afoot to address 
student needs, especially through the up
coming capital campaign. We need student 
help and support if we are to be successful.
John P. Crecine, Senior Vice President for 
Academic Affairs, serves as provost for CFA 
and H&SS, has responsibility for resource 
allocation (capital, operating, and space), 
university planning, computing, libraries, 
and student affairs.
Senator wants 
more problems
continued from page 18 
the administration. Bring us your gripes 
and well bust them. Youll probably be 
surprised at our success, even more surpris
ed at how responsive the faculty and ad
ministration can be.
Student Senate meets tonight at 7:00 
p.m. in the Wherrett Room.
Michael Bett is a senior majoring in 
Mathematics and is Chairman of Student 
Senate.
First, assume the recruiters at the Boston Consulting Group wont be impressed by aBin Corporate Finance.
Second, assume a B-Grade calculator wont 
be good enough to help you make the grade in 
B-School!
We suggest you get a calculator that has 
no equal.
The HP-12C.
So advanced, it doesnt need an equals key. 
So extremely simple to use, youll be mastering 
even the toughest courses.
The HP-12C is a recognized standard in the 
world of business. Ask any banker. Or financial 
analyst. Or consultant.
It offers more built-in financial calculating 
power than any other hand-held. Press just 
one key and quickly solve time value of money 
calculations like net present value, internal 
rate of return, or amortization.
The HP-12Cs quality has no equal. Thats 
something you can see. Even feel. Right down 
to the touch of the keys.
Theyre specifically designed to eliminate 
double entry. So you wont enter more than one 
number at a time.
Its a calculator youll appreciate even more 
as time progresses and as you progress. From 
the classroom to the boardroom.
So make a smart investment right now.
Go to your campus bookstore and get an 
HP-12C.
Or call (800) FOR-HPPC toll-free. Ask for 
Dept. 735A. Well instantly give you the name
of a dealer who 
has no equal.
Then write to 
this address a little 
later on.

It is quite obviously a close-up of a hole of a grate that is situated on a gravel 
path between the Fine Arts building and the tennis courts. But Im sure youve 
been told that x billion times already.
Right on, xxxx. As a matter of fact, every entry we received for this contest gave the 
same answer as yours. If you remember last week, we said answers will be judged on the 
basis of creativity and originality. But how can you adjudicate a winner when all the 
responses are alike?
With this in mind, keep your eyes open for our next photo contest.
