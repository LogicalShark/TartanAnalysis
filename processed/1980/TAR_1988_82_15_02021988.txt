Vectors/Pittsburgh Announces Award'Jordan Named Man of the Year in Education

By JANET SUCHOCKAS
Tartan Staffwriter 
Angel Jordan, the Provost of Carnegie Mel
lon, has been selected as Pittsburgh's 1987 
Man of the Year in Education by the Vectors/ 
Pittsburgh organization.
He was nominated and voted on by about 
" seven hundred of Pittsburghs most influen
tial leaders in business, education, and reli
gion.

Jordan believes receiving the award is a 
great honor, but he is a little amazed. In an 
interview, he explained, I feel a bit embar
rassed because it was me, but I have to tell you 
that there are several other people at Carnegie 
Mellon who probably deserve the award more 
than I do or as much as I do. I am happy with 
the award and highly honored.
He was a little surprised because many of his 
accomplishments were not very visible out
side the University community. He has served 
Carnegie Mellon as a researcher, teacher, ECE 
department head, engineering dean, and now 
as the Provost.
In addition to his newly expanded role as 
Provost, whose duties include managing the 
curriculum and administration of all the col
leges and overseeing most of the major re
search efforts, he has also been the driving 
force in many research and economic develop
ment projects in Pittsburgh.
What he does believe was visible to the
ml
.Alxl 1lGbxEYp gG,m:1 dEmCx:l-Y
Provost Angel Jordan was selected as 
Pittsburghs Man of the Y ear for Education 
for 1987.
Pittsburgh community was his being a cham
pion of manufacturing, education, and re
search. His efforts to bring high technology 
to the university, and to the city, have made 
him an important connection for businessmen 
and financiers not only from within the city, 
but also from across Europe.
The accomplishment he is most proud of is 
the prominence and success of the students 
whom he taught and guided over the years. He 
thinks he was awarded the Man of the Year in 
Education for his accumulation of accom
plishments because each [individual accom
plishment] by itself is good, maybe excellent, 
but is not remarkable. But this Angel Jordan 
happens to be in the middle of everything that 
has to do with education and economic devel
opment in Pittsburgh.
Despite all his accomplishments he does not
intend to stop improving both Carnegie Mel
lon and Pittsburgh.
The dissolution of the office of Senior Vice 
President for Academic Affairs has given the 
Provosts office much broader responsibili
ties, including much closer contact with the 
students. Jordan has resolved to pay the same 
attention at the university level that I paid to 
the students when I was dean, when I was 
department head, or faculty. So I intend to pay 
attention to students across the university. For 
this coming year I would like to make sure that 
there is a better integration of the student life 
with the curriculum.
Although Carnegie Mellon has outstand
ing colleges, faculty, and students, he thinks 
the sense of a family, a community within 
Carnegie Mellon is missing. He wants to 
make sure students feel that they are part of the 
university as a whole through the students 
knowing each other and their professors out
side the classroom. He would like to make 
Carnegie Mellon even more prominent, not 
just in research but in education with the stu
dents internationally and make students 
very proud of having come to Carnegie Mel
lon.
The Man of the Year award is presented to 
outstanding men and women in Pittsburgh in 
specific areas such as education, business, 
labor, religion, and sports as well as overall 
achievement.
The Man of the Year award dinner serves as 
the primary fund-raiser for the Vectors/Pitts
burgh service organization. Vectors/Pitts
burgh is a group of young professionals, which 
was formerly a Jaycees chapter until its charter 
was revoked for allowing women to become 
members.
Last year President Richard Cyert was se
lected as Pittsburghs Man of the Year by the 
group.

promoting ones cause.
At the end of Seales lecture, 
members of the audience were given 
a chance to ask questions.
Seale commented on the need to 
found campus and community ac
tion groups, the need to divest in
vestments in South Africa, and other 
aspects of political action groups 
fighting racism.
To the surprise of most people, 
Seale revealed that he is currently 
writing a barbecue cookbook to be 
called Barbec uing with Bobby. He 
went on to explain how many of the 
political goups he sponsors have lost 
their financial backing since Reagan 
came into office.
Commenting on the importance of 
organizations such as the ones he 
sponsors, groups like the Rainbow 
Coalition, Seale said, We at many 
times have not taken the time to 
analyze the real power we have. The 
legislative frameworks, be they lo
cal, state or federal, are the most 
important political instituions in this 
country.
Seale plans to donate 75 to 80 per
cent of his books profit to various 
political and community action 
groups he sponsors across America.
The lecture was sponsored by 
Spirit and the Political Speakers 
Forum as the kick-off event for 
CMUs black history month in Feb
ruary.

Dr. Joseph Z. Dickson, Pittsburgh Physician and Agnes Fisher Dickson, his wife, provided 
funds in their wills for Carnegie Mellon University to award a prize annually to a person or 
persons who have made outstanding contributions to the field of science in the United States 
of America.
Dr. Mitchell J. Feigenbaum is a theoretical physicist who earned his Ph D from MIT in 1970 
Feigenbaum discovered that large classes of non-linear systems exhibit transitions to chaotic 
behavior which share certain characteristics that are universal and quantitatively measurable 
His work has been acclaimed as the key which might unlock the mysteries surrounding 
perhaps the outstanding unsolved problem of classical physics, namely, the onset of turbu
lence in fluids, as well as other instabilities in a wide variety of physical systems
Presently at Rockefeller University, Feigenbaum continues to refine and generalize his original 
theory. Feigenbaumfs insights into chaotic behavior influence many aspects of physical 
science, mathematics and engmeenng
The university is pleased to honor Dr Mitchell J Feigenbaum for his outstanding contnbutions to physics

Bush, Rather in Heated 
Live TV Exchange
WASHINGTON  A live interview of Vice 
President George Bush by anchorman Dan 
Rather on Jan. 25 deteriorated into a bitter 
argument on live television. Rather, during the 
regular CBS News show, questioned the Vice 
President about the Iran-Contra affair.
Bush agreed to ap
pear on the show after 
the network consented 
to carry the interview 
live. Before the inter
view, CBS ran a long story that suggested that 
Bush had not answered many questions about 
his role in the Iran-Contra affair.
The Vice President immediately charged 
that he had been lured into the interview under 
the false pretense that it would be part of a 
general political profile.
As Rather began asking questions, Bush 
interrupted to dispute the assertions on which 
the anchormans questions were based.
The interview became more heated when 
Rather asserted that Bush was avoiding de
tailed answers. This is what leads people to 
say either, quote, George Bush was irrelevant 
or he was ineffective, said Rather.
During several parts of the interview, the two 
men were speaking at the same time.
Rather contended that in a 1986 meeting with 
an Israeli official. Bush was told that the arms 
sales were part of a deal to win the release of 
the hostages in Lebanon.
During the interview. Bush snapped back, 
Its not fair to judge my whole career by a 
rehash on Iran. How would you like it if I 
judged your career by those seven minutes 
whierTyou walked off tbe set in New York?
Bush referred to an incident in September 
when Rather walked off the set in anger be
cause a tennis match ran over into his time slot.
The interview was cut off abruptly by Rather, 
who asked if the Vice President would agree to 
a press conference devoted entirely to resolv
ing the questions about the Iran-Contra affair. 
As Bush began to answer the question, Rather 
said, I guess that means the answer is no.
Hart to Return Illegal 
Contributions
COUNCIL BLUFFS, Iowa (AP)  Gary 
Hart acknowledged that his presidential cam
paign had received illegal contributions from 
as many as four employees of video producer 
Stuart Karl, and he said he was returning the 
money.
Hart, who had been dogged by reports of 
campaign-finance improprieties for three 
days, made his comments at the start of a 
weekend trip to Iowa, where polls indicate his 
support has been slipping.
It is reported now that Mr. Karl may have 
made or did make contributions through 
employees of his to my campaign, Hart told 
reporters. We have been checking into that as 
well. We have found that there may have been 
as many as four such contributions.
We are returning those contributions to Mr. 
Karl, Hart said. This was in violation of not 
only the restrictions placed upon campaigns 
by the federal election commission but also 
my own standards for campaign practices, and 
we're going to return that money.

Tartan Candidate Profiles: Govs. Dukakis and DuPont
No candidate since 1952 has become 
President without first winning the New 
Hampshire primary. Polls indicate that 
Democrat Michael Dukakis of neighbor
ing Massachusetts will win big there.
PBS fans will remember him as the pho
togenic and articulate moderator of The 
Advocates, a weekly debate series of the 
early 1970s.
The son of Greek immigrants, he gradu
ated from Swarthmore College in political 
science. From there he went on to serve two 
years with the army in Korea.
In the 1960s he was elected to the state as 
a reform candidate. In 1970 he lost a bid for 
lieutenant governor.
In 1974 Dukakis defeated the incumbent 
governor with 56 percent of the vote. Faced 
with a huge deficit as he entered office, he 
concentrated on the budget.
Though he balanced the states budget, a 
combination of new taxes and cuts in serv
ices destroyed his political support. Later 
he restored some benefits and services with 
a large budget surplus in 1977.
Democrats, however, refused to renomi
nate him in 1978. Dukakis spent the the 
next four years as a lecturer at Harvards 
Kennedy School of Government.
In 1982 Dukakis was reinstated as gover
nor and in 1986 he was re-elected. Massa
chusetts has enjoyed strong fiscal and 
economic improvement during his second 
and third terms.
He opposes Star Wars and military aid to 
the Contras and would cancel the Midgetman single warhead missile program.
He proposes increases in education, in
frastructure, and high technology spend
ing. He has not ruled out a tax increase, but 
hopes to raise revenues by collecting 
unpaid taxes.
Words which will come back to haunt 
him: In 1974 he promised, I will never 
turn my back on the elderly Massachu
setts. In 1975 he asked the legislature to 
eliminate a cost of living increase to the 
aged.
While Dukakis is enjoying the limelight 
from his strong showing in New Hamp
shire, a Republican candidate will remain 
in obscurity  former Delaware Gov. 
Pierre DuPont IV.
Though he was by far the first candidate 
to announce his presidential ambitions, he 
has gone no where in the polls. His name 
recognition remains close to zero.
DuPont is by far the most conservative 
candidate in the race and has received 
some attention because of his stands.
Other than that, there is not much else to 
tell. He is a Princeton graduate in engi
neering and Harvard in law.
He served in the Naval Reserve and 
worked in the 1960s for DuPont before 
entering politics.
In the early 1970s he was Delawares 
representative in Congress. From 1977 to
1985 he served as governor. At present he 
is affiliated with the Hudson Institute
A stereotypical Republican, he attended

offer to lend them money to purchase a 
Macintosh computer at the Computer

Editorial _____
Theres Something Theyre Not Telling Us
Pick up any official literature, and youll find Carnegie 
Mellons purpose is to create knowledge and to disseminate 
knowledge through research and teaching.
Ideally, university faculty and staff push the cutting edge of 
research and then communicate their results to the Carnegie 
Mellon community and the world beyond.
Some of the research the university pursues, however, is either 
impossible without restrictions or requires access to classified 
or proprietary information and materials, both of which oppose 
the universitys goal of disseminating knowledge.
The question, then, is how much and in what form should the 
university allow restricted research?
The Faculty Senate has a policy pending that would confine 
restricted research to semi-autonomous units, departments 
and institutes loosely defined as units of the university specifi
cally so designated by University Research Contracts, cur
rently Mellon Institute and the Software Engineering Institute.
Moreover, the policy states that faculty must take an internal 
leave of absence to do restricted work and no student will get 
academic credit for restricted research.
The Tartan applauds Faculty Senate for initiating this policy. 
If there must be restricted research, a clear distinction between 
on-going non-classified and classified research is essential.
But if any restricted research is permitted, the student will be 
the ultimate loser. To paraphrase the 1987 Report from the 
Commission to Evaluate the President, CMU, through its 
emphasis on comparative advantage and entrepreneurial style 
in departments, tends to define quality in terms of association.
In other words, the quality of the universitys education 
resides in the fact that we employ some of the worlds best 
researchers. What good is that if no one but the Department of 
Defense or some private industry knows the results?
Half-way is Half-Baked
Carnegie Mellon University is not known for going half-way 
in anything. Witness the large amount of resources committed 
to Andrew, the Quality of Life campaign, and the Campaign for 
Carnegie Mellon.
However, this depth of commitment stops at the comer of 
Margaret Morrison and Tech Streets. The decision to join the 
University Athletic Association (UAA) was a bold move, but 
the school has not made a full commitment to the new league. 
Currently, the Tartans compete in two conferences, the UAA 
and the Presidents Athletic Conference (PAC), a group of 
seven schools in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Ohio. 
However, the PAC has outlived its usefulness to Carnegie 
Mellon. Sadly, the athletic programs of many of its member 
schools are no longer of Carnegie Mellons caliber.
Witness mens basketball: only two of the leagues seven 
teams are over .500 and the league lost its automatic bid to the 
NCAA tourney after 1985-86 due to its annual poor showing. 
The UAA will provide our Athletic Dept, and athletes, first 
and foremost, better competition. Teams from the UAA have 
already qualified for the NCAA playoffs in mens soccer, 
womens volleyball, football, and mens cross-country.
Second, the athletes might finally receive some long-deserved 
exposure. The last two times Carnegie Mellon Athletics re
ceived any attention were for Diskette Day and the women 
swimming coachs advertisement campaign for players. 
Neither the students, the Pittsburgh populace, nor the alumni 
care when Carnegie Mellon plays Bethany. Perhaps seeing the 
likes of New York University or Washington University at 
Skibo Gym, schools with good programs, may change this. 
The down side is the increased costs. Yes, travel to Chicago 
and St. Louis costs more than Grove City and Washington. But 
isnt it worth it? Can Public Relations get CMU in the Atlanta 
and Baltimore papers now for the same budget?
Other arguments are excuses. Often cited is the increased 
travel time. What takes longer, a one-and-a-half flight hour to 
St. Louis or a three hour drive to Cleveland?
Also mentioned is the increased tax on athletes academic 
performance. Judicious scheduling, including an emphasis on 
kEE8E-B games, should be able to solve this problem. How do 
athletes at Northwestern^tanfordpr Rice copeeasier classes? 
There are nine members of the UAA. One, the University of 
Chicago, quit its local conference when it became a charter 
HEH,Ebi Its now Carnegie Mellons turn.
Letters:
AB Responds to Claim of Poor Planning
Editor:
Your editorial Maybe Someday, 
AB, had some valid points. I also 
wish David Naster could have per
formed in the Ballroom last Satur
day. Thats why, when I booked him 
in November, his act was scheduled 
for that room. AB Concerts had very 
tentative plans, but it was agreed that 
Coffeehouse would have the ball
room, Concepts would have the 
Wherrett Room. That was in No
vember.
On returning from break this 
semester, 1 was informed that Naster 
was moved to the Wherrett Room. I 
was not consulted and had no say in 
the matter. At this point, I was not 
about to back out of a contract and 
lose over $1000 of the students' 
money. Monday, January 18, four 
days before the performance, I saw 
WRCT publicity, billing their con
cert at 8:00 pm - another surprise to 
me. When I originally booked Naster, I was assured that the concert, if 
there were one, would start at 10:00 
pm. Yet WRCT thought differently.
So contrary to your editorial com
ments, it was not poor planning on 
my part that affected the show. I 
planned this act almost three months 
ago. Both SDC and AB movies 
werent scheduled until mid-December, and I dont believe Scotland 
Yard signs any contracts, much less 
three months in advance. The funny 
thing is, if you had bothered to speak 
to David Naster after the show, he 
would have told you, as he told me, 
that what you called audible compe
tition was his favorite part of the 
show. He thrives on spontaneity and 
improvisation, and loved the mate
ria^ it provided him with. He was 
neither insulted by nor displeased 
with Saturdays events any way.
You also suggested putting Naster 
in another room. If you find any 
good comedian who wants to per
form in a lecture hall, with no lights, 
no sound, no stage, with a black
board behind him, Ill hire him.
Like I said before, your article does 
raise some valid points. However, 
your comments were directed at the 
wrong people. This school has pro
gramming difficulties due to an in
credible lack of facilities and a se
vere case of student apathy. It seems 
your energies would be better spent 
if they were directed at overcoming 
these problems, instead of criticiz
ing efforts to do so.
Gina Marie Marsala 
AB Coffeehouse Chairman
Movie Wasnt Intended to 
Promote Racism, Says AB
Editor:
As the AB Thursday films chair
person, 1 would like the chance to 
defend myself from the remarks 
made by Matt Hawkins in his letter 
last week.
Many movies offend many people, 
but that does not indicate that they 
are devoid of educational value. It is 
not the duty of AB to act as a censor
ship board; I have tried to present the 
campus community with many 
films one might never see due to 
their obscurity, unpopularity, and in 
some cases their controversiality. 
The film in question was presented 
to me as part of a film appreciation 
class, from which I learned quite a 
bit about the film.
The Birth of a Nation cost eleven 
times the norm for a feature film, and 
it was the longest and most techni
cally sophisticated film ever made in 
America at the time. It was also the 
top grossing film of all time until
1948, so apparently not everyone 
found it as worthless as did Mr. 
Hawkins. From a film enthusiast 
perspective, these are all good rea
sons for showing the film. From a 
historical perspective, it tells the 
story of the American Civil War 
from a southern point of view, and I 
do believe that even Matt Hawkins 
will agree that you can not fight 
prejudice until you understand its 
sources.
Unfortunately, I do not usually pay 
attention to a calendar when sched
uling films, to simplify matters, I 
work from a list of Thursdays. Fur
thermore, if you pay close attention 
to the film schedule, you will note 
that I have made an effort to present 
an abbreviated history of film, be
ginning with one of the greatest si
lent films, and working from there, 
to the present. It was just an unlucky 
coincidence that The Birth of a Na1l-x:-GEB l- .CE ^J
Censorship 
Keeps Real 
Life Out of 
School Papers
Editor:
Once again Thomas Heim, 
author of Conservative Comer, 
has proven himself naive and 
uninformed. The Supreme 
Court decision which turns 
unlimited power of censorship 
over high school papers to the 
principal was not a decision 
intended to protect the school 
from overzealous reporters 
whose print-matter might result 
in law suits. Rather, the deci
sion protects the school from 
students who feel an obligation 
to discuss real life issues such 
as divorce, a topic which, in my 
view, the schools are irrespon
sible to neglect. Fortunately, 
high school students have other 
places to turn for knowledge 
than idiotic principals and 
teachers. Youth Cry, the leftist 
group for high school seniors, is 
such a place to turn.

 Inquiring Minds:Bush/Rather Debate Sparking National Trend
By THE INQUIRING STAFF
Doesnt it make you wonder? By sheer coin
cidence, both Dan Rathers and George 
Bushs ratings are up because of their debate 
last Monday. Not that you probably care, but it 
does seem kind of suspicious, doesn't it?
Were dealing with 
two of the lowest 
forms of human life, 
television news an
chors and Presidential 
candidates/Vice Presidents (take your pick).
It really seems hard to believe that Bush 
didnt expect Rather to question him about 
Iran. After all, how could George have remem
bered that Dan Rather skipped seven minutes 
of a broadcast this summer? Bush still cant re
member whether he made two or three trips to 
Israel in 1986.
After all, the Vice President fs known for 
being slightly less capable of dealing with the 
press than Frank Sinatra. This is the man who, 
right after the debate, called Dan Rather a 
bastard, and referred to CBS as your god
damned network.
We only know this because George didnt 
know that he was still on tape. The next day 
Bush revealed that he wouldn t have said those 
those things had he known. Pity he didnt 
kick a little ass like he did to Geraldine 
Ferraro the last time around.
Of course, Mr. Rather also had a few things 
to say the next day. He admitted that the con
frontation was not as graceful as he would 
have liked. Sort of like Gerald Ford perform
ing figure skatings compulsory exercises at 
the Calgary Olympics.
Now that its over with, and CBSs ratings 
are returning to normal, where does that leave 
us? Back at George Bushs record, the thing 
that got him in trouble the first place.
Was Bush present at the Cabinet Meeting on 
January 7, 1986 when George Schulz and 
Caspar Weinberger voiced strong opposition 
to the arms deal? Bush says no; he also says he 
cant really recall, but hes almost positive he 
wasnt there.
Dan Rather says Bush was, and George 
Schulz agrees. President Reagan sticks with 
Bush and says he wasnt. However, since no
Conservative Corner:
one big died in Russia, and no member of the 
Royal Family got married that week, where 
else could he have been?
Theres also the character issue. Does 
George have one? We called his mother, she 
thinks so, but she also told us that she just loves 
that darling Gary Trudeau for being the first 
cartoonist who could really capture her son on 
paper. It just may be possible that Mrs. Bush is 
a wee bit senile.
A lot of people seem to think that Bush is a 
wimp, but no one is willing to admit it; they 
just like to talk about him at cocktail parties. 
President Reagan said, There didn't seem to 
be any wimp in George Bush. House Minor
ity Leader Robert Michel went further saying, 
Ive never considered the Vice President to 
be a wimp. Well, the Republican leadership is 
behind him, and theres no more trustworthy 
group than that.
Maybe its all a myth, just like trickle-down 
economics. Then again, with a name like 
George Herbert Walker Bush, it would be

TEL M^COMKAPE, WHYARf WEMAWH6 SUCH 
A m PEAL OUT Of THEIR STAfrtfARS PUHSf
U.S. Should Continue Military Aid to Afghanistan
By THOMAS HEIM
Secretary of State George Schultz recently 
suggested that U.S. aid to the freedom fighting
Mujahiddin in Afghanistan stop before the
Soviets withdraw the 115,UUU troops occupy
ing the country. Should Schultz's suggestions 
be implemented be
fore a non-communist 
government is in
place, the United 
States might find itself 
repeating the Vietnam experience in Afghani
stan. The United States should make no
changes on aid to the Mujahiddin until the
Soviets actually pull out.
An end to U.S. aid would remove the strength 
of the force that has forced Gorbachev to 
reconsider the Soviet position in Afghanistan. 
The United States originally committed to cut 
aid when the Soviets began withdrawal. This 
commitment was made two years ago and with 
the condition that the U.S. could get a satisfac
tory agreement where there would be a guar
antee of self determination. This requires a 
complete end to communist control and influ
ence over the country. Political analysts and 
writers Rowland Evans and Robert Novak feel 
that if aid is cut before this time, the United 
States could fall victim again as it did after the 
Paris Accords in the Vietnam War. We actough not to have an inferiority complex.
In the final analysis, maybe we can just at
tribute it all to the'heat of combat, which is 
what the Vice President called the whole mess. 
It was only 40 years ago that Bush was a pilot 
in the Navy, and Rather probably is more scary 
than a squadron of Zeros ever were.
The debate has changed our little world. 
Bush is gaining on Dole in Iowa, and Rather's 
ratings are higher than they've been in recent 
memory. Tomorrow night, Tom Brokaw 
meets Alexander Haig in a three-round bout 
live from Trump's Castle in Atlantic City. 
Peter Jennings hopes to interview Hitler's 
ghost by the end of the week. Locally, Edye 
Tarbox still has nothing to say; some things 
never change.
Dan Rather has succeeded in raising George 
Bush from the casts of George Romero's 
Living Dead, eclipsing anything Bob 
Woodward has ever done. As for us, the whole 
debacle hasn't changed the way we're voting. 
Harold Stassen is on the ballot again; we think 
he's due.
The Inquiring Staff'is S. Levine, C.
Williams, and R. Wilson.

cepted guarantees from North Vietnam in 
accepting the Paris Accords. Their purpose 
was to end the Vietnam war at the same time as 
protecting Saigons independence from North 
Vietnam. Within months Soviet backed Hanoi 
broke every one of the accords. The writers 
draw many parallels between this situation in 
Vietnam and Afghanistan today. They list the 
geographic proximity of ready communist 
power in both Vietnam and Afghanistan; the 
distant United States; political difficulties in 
restarting a military aid operation once it has 
been stopped (they rightfully compare this 
also to the freedom fighters in Nicaragua); and 
most importantly the lack of evidence that 
Soviet promises in Afghanistan are more cred
ible than Hanoi's promises in Paris.
John Negroponti, deputy National Security 
Aide, feels that a Soviet withdrawal within six 
months would not leave a strong communist 
puppet government in Kabul. However, if it 
takes the Soviets 18 months, he feels that the 
Soviets would be likely to hold on to power. 
The U. S. should not be eager to give Gor
bachev a chance to continue communist con
trol of Afghanistan; we should instead escalate 
aid to the freedom fighters to lean on the 
communists and give Gorbachev new reasons 
for a true rapid withdrawal, after which time 
the U.S. aid position can be reconsidered.
By MICHAEL FRANZINI &
MICHAEL WITBROCK
Imagine a scenario which might mushroom
into the Third World War. Imagine that one
superpower, say the Soviet Union, executed 
an unprovoked attack against the other, taking 
the lives of two to three hundred civilians.
Imagine that a civilian 
airliner which strayed 
into Soviet airspace
was destroyed under
hostile Soviet fire, 
along with about 269 passengers.
Now imagine the Presidents response. Mr. 
Reagan would, quite rightly, rail against such 
an act. Relations with the Soviet Union would 
turn sour. The paranoid policies of contain
ment which strained US-Soviet relations from 
Truman until Carter would return. Continuing 
arms control negotiations would be unthink
able. The world would inch nearer to the brink 
of nuclear destruction.
Such a scenario should not be hard to imag
ine. It is true that the Soviet Union, on August 
31,1983, shot down a civilian plane, killing its 
269 passengers. It is true that the President 
asserted, a week after the attack, that there is 
no way a pilot could mistake this for anything 
other than a civilian airliner. It is true that 
White House spokesman Larry Speaks went 
on to claim irrefutable proof that the Soviets 
knew what they were shooting down.
It is true that the President allowed USSoviet relations to turn sour because of what 
he termed a terrorist act."
The rest of the story is wrong.
Within hours of the attack. U.S. intelligence 
had definite proof that the Soviets believed 
that what they were shooting down actually 
was a U.S. RC-135 reconnaissance plane, a 
plane which had been in the same area a few 
hours before. This fact, first released two 
years ago in Seymour Hershs book The Tar
get is Destroyed, had been ignored by the 
Administration and most of the Press, until 
two weeks ago. Two weeks ago. an Admini
stration official reluctantly admitted, by re
leasing an intelligence report (declassified 
under the Freedom of Information Act), that 
the only definite proof shows that the Presi
dent fibbed.
While the U.S. decries the disinformation in 
Soviet propaganda and proclaims its own 
preeminence in the free circulation of infor
mation, the Reagan Administration has been 
deliberately deceiving the American public
and the world.
This deception has not been over such a pettv 
matter as that which ended Nixon's political 
life; it has been over vital matters of national 
security. Were the President's platform an 
issue in the upcoming elections, the voters 
might Yinally- recognize that a platform. ? 
founded in hypocrisy should be shot down in 
flames.
As the story of the Presidential deception 
over Flight KAL007 followsthe taleofPresidential ignorance in the Iran/Contra affair, 
two glaring questions emerge. How many 
other times has the President put national 
security at risk by lying for the sake of domes
tic political expedience? And why has the 
American publ ic endured seven years of an ad
ministration plagued by incompetence and 
living by lies?

Solomon Accused of Distorting Facts
Editor:
The Tartans January 19 Conservatively 
Speaking column complains of misrepresen
tation of violence in Israels occupied territo
ries. Aaron Solomon charges that the media 
is creating news by exaggeration, suppres
sion of facts, and exploitation of ambiguous 
images. These are exactly the tactics he uses 
to present the current and past situation in the 
occupied territories. When convenient Mr. 
Solomon simply uses made-up facts.
He claims Jordan expelled Jews from the 
West Bank in 1948 and that Israel, by contrast, 
made citizens of its Arab inhabitants. The 
1948 U.N. partition plan gave the West Bank 
to Palestinians because there were virtually no 
Jews living there. There were, however, many 
Arabs living in what became Israel and if the 
Israelis had to make them citizens they were 
determined to get rid of as many as possible. 
Over 700,000 Palestinians fled fighting during 
the 1948 war, encouraged, and often forced, 
by Israeli troops. These refugees were never 
allowed to return to their homes. For several 
years following the 1948 war the United Na
tions annually passed a resolution, supported 
by the U.S., calling on Israel to either compen
sate the refugees for their land or allow them to 
return. Israel ignored the resolution.
Mr. Solomon moves on to a fairy tale version 
of the 1967 war, asserting Israel occupied the 
West Bank, Gaza Strip, Sinai Peninsula, and 
Golan Heights in response to an aggressive 
war launched by Egypt, Jordan, and Syria. 
The facts stand: Israel launched the 1967 war. 
Completely taken by a surprise attack, the 
Arab armies were decimated in six days. Israel 
began settling these territories where, with the 
exception of Sinai, its least desired acquisi
tion, it remains today.
Mr. Solomon offers Arab unwillingness to 
negotiate as a basis for continued occupation 
claiming their refusal makes it perfectly le
gal. This argument has no basis in law; the oc
cupation is perfectly illegal. In 1981 the U.N. 
Security Council unanimously condemned
Israel for its illegal annexation of the Golan 
Heights. Solomon seems to think that the Arab 
states merely have to conclude a peace treaty 
ala Camp David and Israel will willingly with
draw from the territories. The reality is that 
Israel shows little willingness to. negotiate.
The 1978 Camp David treaty took Egypt out 
of the military equation allowing Israel to nail 
down the territories she most coveted and has 
no intention of returning. Since 1978 the 
number of Jewish settlers in the West Bank has 
grown from 5,000 to over60,000, making it in
creasingly unlikely they would ever leave. 
Also in that time, Israel has bombed Tunis and 
Iraq, invaded Lebanon and annexed the Golan 
Heights, whose return now would be tanta
mount to giving up Israeli land. These are 
hardly the good faith gestures of a country that 
wants to negotiate peace.
Israel can continue to stonewall negotiations 
by refusing to meet with the only Palestinians 
that command respect among a majority of 
their people. It is politically convenient for the 
P.L.O. to remain anathema because while Is
rael arrests, detains, and deports all home
grown Palestinian leadership there remains no 
one to talk to. That suits the present govern
ment, which this week again rejected calls for 
an international peace conference on the 
grounds it would be equivalent to relinquish
ing the territories.
If Aaron Solomon would like to see truth and 
fairness in the media he ought to start practic
ing it himself. He must get his facts straight 
and stop substituting for reality some cloudy 
interpretation of myth. Further, I hope any 
human being would share the media's indig
nation at needless loss of life. Mr. Solomons 
callous attitude implies that Palestinian death 
needn't be mourned. This kind of despicable 
racism has already resulted in too much unnec
essary bloodshed.

tion fell on a day that did not meet with Mr.
Hawkins approval. I would further like to com
ment on Hawkins belief that AB works to pro
mote and provoke racial tension on campus. As I 
stated previously, many films offend many 
people, and if AB had to protect every persons 
interests, we would in fact never sponsor any 
event. In addition, it seems that in his readiness to 
criticize, Hawkins has forgotten that AB has in the 
past sponsored many events for Black History 
month, including the lecturers Melvin Van 
Peebles and Pearl Bowser along with the Thurs
day film selections. The last clarification I would
like to make is that once the films are cho
sen, they are sent to the Director of Student 
Activities and the Dean of Student Affairs 
for approval.
I am sorry that Mr. Hawkins took offense 
to our film schedule, but at the same time,
I believe that it was a paranoid response to 
an innocent act. The Activities board may 
be guilty of oversight but not of racism as 
Mr. Hawkins so forcefully implies.

Ueberroth To Give Fairless Lecture This Month
photo by Howdy Pierce
By CHRIS YOUNG
Tartan Assistant News Editor
On February 15, Peter V. Ueberroth will give Carnegie 
Mellons 1988 Benjamin F. Fairless Memorial Lecture entitled 
If Enough People Care. Ueberroth was elected baseballs 
sixth commissioner by the 26 Major League owners in March 
' 1984.
Prior to his election, Ueberroth served five years as President 
and Chief Executive Officer of the Los Angeles Olympic Or
ganizing Committee (LAOOC). A private, non-profit organi
zation, the LAOOC was responsible for staging and operating 
the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Games. Under Ueberroths 
leadership, the first privately financed Olympic games resulted 
in a surplus of nearly $250 million, which today supports youth
I and sports programs throughout the United States. His story 
about the 1984 Olympic Games, Made In America, was pub
lished in 1985 by William Morrow and is a best seller.
As a result of his success with the Los Angeles Olympic 
Games, Ueberroth was named Time magazines 1984 Man of 
the Year.
Ueberroth was a star athlete throughout his high school (Fre
mont Union High School, California) and college (San Jose 
State University) years. After graduating from San Jose State 
with a degree in business, Ueberroth moved to Hawaii, where 
 he launched a career in the travel industry. At the age of 22, he 
became a vice president and shareholder in Trans International 
Airlines, owned by Los Angeles financier Kirk Kerkorian. In 
1963, he founded the First Travel Corporation. When he sold 
the company in 1980, it was the second largest travel business 
in North America.
Ueberroth has received honorary degrees from the Monterey
The Difference 
Between Police 
and Security
By CARLOS FRANCO
Tartan Staffwriter
What is the difference between Cam
pus Police and Campus Security 
Guards? If you dont know, you arent 
alone. Most people on campus, includ
ing third and fourth year students, dont 
know the difference either.
The main distinction is that Campus 
Police officers are sworn in by the court. 
These officers have all the powers of 
regular police officers.
Campus Police have the same author
ity to arrest as the Pittsburgh Police. 
They are also allowed to carry firearms 
which is something that Campus Secu
rity guards are not allowed to do.
Campus Police are required to uphold 
federal, state, and local statutes when 
necessary as well as university policy. 
They are also in charge of taking de
tailed crime reports.
Campus Police are also responsible for 
filing city reports of crimes committed 
on campus. Security cannot take crime 
reports or investigate crimes.
The jurisdiction of Campus Security 
and Police includes all university prop
erty as well as a short distance off cam
pus. Both departments are responsible 
for insuring that university personnel 
and properties are safe.
When encountering suspicious per
sons, activities or situations, Security is 
required to report immediately to Cam
pus Police by means of two way radios.
An additional duty of Campus Police 
is to take accident reports and be on the 
scene of medical emergencies. One 
fourth of the Campus Police officers are 
certified emergency medical techni
cians, so they are able to handle medical 
emergencies. If the medical emergency 
dictates further medical care. Campus 
Police will provide transportation toone 
of the local hospitals.
There are presently 21 police officers 
under Director James LaPaglia, and 20 
security guards.
Baseball Commissioner Peter Ueberroth will speak at Car
negie Mellon on February 15th. Tickets are available 
through GSIA.
Institute of International Studies, Pepperdine University, 
Claremont McKenna College, Loyola-Marymount University, 
College of the Holy Cross, San Jose State University, Lafayette 
College, Ohio University, and the University of Maryland. He 
is also a Scopus Laureate from the University of Jerusalem. He 
has received several awards, including the French Legion 
dHonneur; Royal Order of the Polar Star from His Majesty, the 
King of Sweden; and the Olympic Order, Gold, International 
Olympic Committee.
The Benjamin F. Fairless Memorial Lectures endowment 
fund was established at Carnegie Mellon University by friends 
of Mr. Fairless to support a series of annual lectures. Interna
tionally known figures from the world of business, government 
or education are invited each year to lecture at Carnegie Mellon 
under the auspices of the Graduate School of Industrial Ad
ministration.
In accordance with the lecture series policy, GSIA is not 
allowed to disclose the specific topic on which Ueberroth will 
speak. The lecture title, however, is If Enough People Care.
The lectures focus on aspects of business or public admini
stration; the relationships between business and government, 
management and labor, or a subject related to the themes of 
preserving economic freedom, human liberty and the strength
ening of individual enterprise  air of which were matters of 
deep concern to Mr. Fairless throughout his career.
Mr. Fairless was President of United States Steel Corporation 
for fifteen years and Chairman of the Board from 1952 until his 
retirement in 1955. A friend of Carnegie Mellon University for 
many years, he served on the board of trustees from 1952 until 
his death on January 1, 1962. In 1959 he was named honorary' 
chairman of the board.
Just Say Yes! to
My family has a bit of a history of codeine 
appreciation. It started in the early sixties, 
when my father was my age, and one could 
purchase codeine-based Stokes cough syrup at 
the comer drugstore. My poor mother, what it 
must have been like on weekends when my 
| dad took a recreational dose of Stokes and 
turned loopy .
Back in 1982, my friend Steve was in a play 
given by one of the repertory groups in my 
high school. During the weekend between the 
first and second performances, Steve broke his 
ankle, and was prescribed codeine. Bob, he 
said to me during that time. Break your ankle! 
Codeine is greatV'
I To give you an idea of the effect that codeine 
had on Steve, compare this bit of dialogue, 
from the first performance of the play, with the
same bit of dialogue from the second perform
ance:
[before codeine]
ANDREW: Is something wrong? Are you 
ill?
STEVE: No, no dear Algernon. It is simply 
that I have finally put down on paper what I 
have felt my whole life, but have been unable 
to express.
ANDREW: A poem?
STEVE: Yes; a brief one, but all the more 
profound for its brevity.
[after codeine]
ANDREW: Is something wrong? Are you 
ill?
STEVE: No, uh, Im fine. I just wrote down 
something that I think about all the time.
ANDREW: A poem?
60 SECONDS9:xA eFe QTUrRnTa
Well, I didnt break my ankle, but just re
cently I came down with a serious cough. I 
went to the Health Office. Please prescribe 
codeine, I thought. Please, oh please, give 
me codeine. Im going to prescribe some co
deine for that cough, said a very wonderful 
doctor. Let me tell you something. Steve was 
right. Codeine is great.
In fact, as I write this I am still taking codeine 
and feeling kind of loopy myself. So if seems 
this ungrammatical column or think you inco
herent it is, please you understand to overlook.
Actually it gets better. I mean, the codeine by 
itself would be enough to make me turn hand
springs of chemical glee, but my prescription 
happens to be Robitussin cough syrup with 
codeine! Now, I know many of you wont 
agree, but I think Robitussin is the best tasting 
stuff in the world. (The label on a bottle of 
Robitussin modestly states that the active 
ingredients are in a palatable, aromatic 
syrup. This, to me, is humble in the extreme.)
I mean, if Robitussin weren't medicine, I'd be 
swigging it all the time and the devil take your 
continued on page 13
Codeine
STEVE: Uh huh.
(Luckily, Andrew was an excellent improvi
sor.)
[This dialogue really is from a play entitled 
Horatio and Algernon, written by Andrew 
Clateman and Steven Stem and performed at 
Hunter College High School in New York City 
in February, 1982. There. Now if this ever gets 
around to them, it wont piss them off.]

The Medicine Police Raid Glickstein
continued from page 11
DWI laws. But, of course, it is medicine and I 
cant take it all the time, because when I was 
growing up my mother said to me, There are 
Medicine Police driving around in unmarked 
cars with special detectors to find people who 
taking medicine they dont need, and they 
can ARREST you if you do. Deep down, I
that I do have the gene that lets me curl my 
tongue into a U). The ones that could taste it 
said,Gaah! Arrgh! Bletch! and grimaced for 
an hour. Anyway, there seems to be a correla
tion between people who could taste this foul 
chemical (whose name I dont recall) and 
people who absolutely hate the taste of Robitussin cough syrup. Dont you think thats
ROBITUSSIN: 
Its not just for 
colds anymore.
Tall believe in the Medicine Police; havent 
you ever seen Crockett and Tubbs in action? 
Not that I would call that beautiful white 
Testarossa an unmarked car. Geez, what a 
beauty. (Did you see the episode where they 
blew up the Daytona Crockett used to have? 
God. My friends and I cried for weeks.)
Which reminds me. Im doing a kind of 
study. In ninth grade biology, my class did this 
Experiment where everyone got these little 
strips impregnated with some sort of chemical 
or other (no, its not what youre thinking). 
The experiment was to see who could taste the 
chemical in the paper. Apparently, theres a 
single gene that controls whether or not you 
can taste it. I couldnt (but Im happy to say
photo by A. E. Greeninteresting? I do.I seem to have strayed a little bit. Back to 
codeine. Codeine is great. I mean its really 
great. Not only did it eliminate my cough, 
drop-kicking it into oblivion in a second, but it 
makes me feel... nice, kind of the way a Boy 
Scout feels when he helps an old lady across 
the street, only this lasts for many, many 
blocks. You want to hear something weird? 
Last night, about a half-hour after a dose of 
codeine, I jogged 500 laps in my apartment. I 
mean, the last exercise I got was carrying my 
bags into my apartment after Winter Break. 
Anyway, thats just one of the reasons I think 
codeine is great. Codeine is really, really, 
really great.

EDITOR: Get a grip on yourself, Bob.
ME: Sorry.
I hope by now Ive made my feelings about 
codeine clear. Of course, every silver lining 
has its cloud, or something like that, and I have 
experienced one drawback from taking co
deine. It has to do with the fact that codeine 
leaves you feeling kind of dippy. So a couple 
of nights ago Im sitting with a group of people 
at a bar (which wishes to remain anonymous), 
experimenting with mixing chemicals (etha
nol and codeine phosphate USP), and I have 
this rapport going with a really fabulous babe 
 I mean beautiful woman  and I think the 
codeine made me blow a good opportunity. 
This woman wishes to remain anonymous, but 
for the sake of discussion lets call her 
Paulina Porizkova.

do you live?
ME: The whole world is my home!
PAULINA: I mean do you have an apartment

ME: Can anybody ever really have any

PAULINA: Do you have any roommates?
ME: Actually, we all do. There are millions 
and millions of tiny parasites living in our 
bodies all the time.
PAULINA: Thats disgusting!
ME: Its the truth, baby.
PAULINA: Ecch.
ME: I want some cough syrup.
PAULINA: Are you sick?
ME: Oh, yeah. Phlegm all over the place! I 
love it!
In conclusion, Id like to talk about the Big

Scotch n Soda Offers 
Drama, Diversity in Theater
By TERENCE SPIES
Tartan Staffwriter
Scotch V Soda, the campus open drama 
group, is something of a puzzle. It gets rave 
reviews in all the campus promotional litera
ture as the group responsible for Pippin and 
Godspell, major Broadway hits, and launch
ing the careers of several major thespians. 
Despite this promoted standing as a major 
force on campus, the talented group is rele
gated to a smallish office on the first floor of 
Skibo, and survives with a membership fluctu
ating between 30 and 70 
people.
Members of the group 
are not just actors. Scotch 
n Soda provides abun
dant opportunity for stu
dents interested in design, 
directing, writing, and all 
other aspects of theater 
work. These non-actors 
are an important part of 
the program, according 
to President Elizabeth 
Rueger.
Diversity is not only re
stricted to the groups 
theater skills. All majors on campus are represented, breaking through 
the sometimes seemingly impenetrable wall 
between majors at Carnegie Mellon. Says di
rector Tamar Copeland: Its a great way to get 
different majors together to have fun.
The group is basically involved in two activi
ties: entertaining the campus and honing their 
dramatic skills through weekly workshops. 
(Although Jethro Tull listening was also 
cited as an official club diversion.) Anyone on 
campus can become a member by participat
ing in either one or both activities; this ad hoc 
membership policy accounts for the variable
membership counts. In keeping with this in
formal membership policy, the club charges 
no dues from members.
Plays in Scotland Yard and the Spring Pro
duction are the groups main entertainment 
events. The plays in Scotland Yard are pre
sented in an informal dinner theatre atmos
phere, and usually consist of comedy or lighter 
fare. The play done this year in Scotland Yard 
was an original student-written piece. Stu
dents also direct and produce all the clubs 
shows. The Spring Production is put on by
...Scotch n Soda
Scotch n Soda during Spring Carnival every 
year.
Weekly workshops are conducted by Scotch 
n Soda every week on a variety of topics. At 
the workshops, various skills, from acting to 
writing, are exercised. These workshops are 
not just another lecture or course however. 
Tony Nurse, a member, says the workshops 
are fun and a good way to blow off pressure.
Robert Andersons I'm Herbert is Scotch n 
Sodas latest endeavor, being held in Scotland 
Yard on February 16 and 17 at 6:30 pm. The 
Spring Production, currently veiled in seUniversity Ambassadors Represent 
Carnegie Mellon to the Public
By KELLY SPENCER
Tartan Staffwriter 
Last fall, Maryann Moore, Director of 
Special Events at CMU, and twenty-four 
CMU students combined to form a new 
campus organization: University Ambas
sadors. Modelled after the Crimson Girls 
and Capstone Men of Alabama and the 
Pennsylvania State Line Ambassadors, 
University Ambassadors is an association 
of full-time undergraduate sophomores, 
juniors or seniors that are chosen to be 
official hosts and hostesses of university 
events. The mission as stated is to promote 
and increase an understanding of the pro
grams, policies, and interests of the univer
sity to all its publics.
The group is a recognized student organi
zation operating on a volunteer basis. 
Members are selected each semester by a 
panel of student ambassadors and their 
advisors. Among the necessary qualifica
tions are a QPA of at least 2.5, strong 
communication skills, and leadership abil
ity. University Relations Assistant Director 
Lisa Cherevka says personality is one of the 
most important considerations. She em
phasizes that candidates must be outgoing 
individuals with an ability to speak easily 
with strangers.
Ambassadors undergo an intensive oneday training session in which they are 
briefed on every aspect of the university 
and its history by various members of 
CMUs faculty and administration, includ
ing President Cyert. In addition to this session, ambassadors attend weekly meetings 
of approximately one hour each in which 
they are briefed more specifically on the 
particulars of upcoming events. Members 
can expect to be active in about two major 
events a month. Past projects have included 
the opening of SEI, the Fairless Lecture 
with Doug Danforth, Parents Day, and 
Whats New at CMU? Upcoming proj
ects include the Dickson Prize ceremony-, 
the Fairless Lecture with Peter Ueberroth, 
the Presidents Distinguished Lecture Se
ries, and the Trustees Meeting.
Student Ambassadors develop extensive 
public relation and communication skills 
while simultaneously gaining the opportu
nity to meet top members of CMUs ad
ministration, learn the workings of the 
university, meet the press, and coordinate 
valuable contacts for future employment. 
And its also fun, laughs one ambassa
dor. Working with University Ambassa
dors, she was fortunate enough to meet such 
prestigious company as Dick Thornburgh, 
former governor of Pennsylvania, Roy 
Hunt, trustee of CMU and benefactor of 
Hunt Library, and a cabinet member of 
Israels prime minister.
A brochure elaborating on the 
organizations activities and programs will 
be coming out later this spring. If you are 
interested in applying, applications will be 
available on February 9 at the Information 
Desk in the University Relations Office, 
3030 Hamburg Hall and are due by 5 pm, 
Friday, February 19.
crecy, is an original work, and will be pre
sented on April 14, 15, 16, and 17.
Current board members are President Eliza
beth Rueger; Steven Carpenter, Vice-President; John Zimmerman, Tamar Copeland, and
Javier Grillo-Marxauch, Directors.
Scottish Soda is one of Carnegie Mellons 
unique resources. It is surprising that more 
students dont indulge their dramatic tenden
cies by joining the club.TtJTOIEM

contest realistic, six percent annual interest 
was paid on any cash left in account, and 
dividends that occurred during the contest 
were accepted. The three portfolios with the 
highest value at the closing were awarded 
prizes from a pool of 150 dollars. These 
awards were provided by Prudential-Bache 
and E. F. Hutton, 
j During the contest Wall Street went through 
its most troublesome period since the Great 
Depression. Amazingly enough, most of the 
portfolios submitted reflected the general 
optimism of the public one week before the 
crash. All in all, it was a tough time for inves
to do to win was to leave 40,000 dollars in an 
account, and invest the rest in any stock that 
retained more than 40 percent of its purchase 
price.
The top four contestants submitted single 
stock portfolios. The top winner was Senior 
James Bischoff whose portfolio at closing was 
worth 43,973 dollars and had invested solely 
in Echobay Mines. Junior Eric Stampfli came 
in second place with 42,905 dollars worth of 
Telex shares. Third place was shared by two 
contestants, Sophomore Evan Swietnicki and 
Senior Kevin Stokker, who invested all of 
their portfolios in Merck.
If you are interested in stock contests, and 
would like to know more about the Stock 
Contest running this semester, stop by at the 
next Investment Group meeting on Wednes
day evening at 7:00 pm in Skibo 45.

Play the Market This Semester 
with the Stock Selection Contest
Last semester the Investment Group held a 
campus-wide stock selection contest. The 
entry fee was two dollars for each portfolio, 
and in return the participants received fifty 
thousand dollars in paper money. However, 
they were required to invest a minimum of ten 
thousand dollars in any readily accessible 
stock (one listed in the Wall Street Journal). 
The contest began on October 12th and ran for 
eight weeks until November 27th. To keep the
tors and none of the contestants made a profit. 
People with large and diverse portfolios were 
hurt the most. Actually all a contestant needed

Hockey Ties Pitt
By NEAL A. LEVENE
Tartan Staffwriter
The Carnegie Mellon hockey club played a 
tough physical game against the Pitt Panthers 
last week in which they came back from an 
early 2-0 deficit. They approached the brink of 
victory only to fall back and settle for a 4-4 tie.
Simply put, the game was disappointing. 
Carnegie Mellon came out with everything 
they needed to win, except consistency. It was 
a game that should have been won.
The Ice Tartans (3-2-1 in the West Penn 
College Hockey Association [WPCHA]) were 
coming off a 6-2 win against the physically 
demanding Wolverines of West Virginia 
University. The Tartans were psyched; they 
had played virtually flawless hockey the night 
before, especially on their power plays. Un
fortunately, what the WVU win gave to the 
Tartans in momentum, it took away in stam
ina. The Tartans showed up for Sundays 
game tired.
Nowhere was this fatigue more apparent 
than in Carnegie Mellons dismal showing in 
the first period. With the possible exception of 
goalie John Kerber, WRCTs Panther Hollow 
Inn Player of the Game, the Tartans were 
hardly ready for the opening period. Their 
play was sluggish, passes were sloppy, and the 
puck was constantly in the Tartan end.
Kerber, however, was incredible; in the face 
of incredible pressure, he stopped almost 
everything that came near him. There was 
more than one Kerber-save that should have 
made it into the net. In spite of Kerbers 
performance, Carnegie Mellon was lucky to 
escape the first period down only 2-0.
The tide was to turn in the second period, 
however. At 4:15, senior center Greg Tim
mons got the first Tartan goal off a pass from 
Tim Larsen. The Tartans second goal came at 
10:44. With Pitts Beknie Antdneo sitting out 
for slashing, Timmons threaded a shot from
the blue line that got through three defenders 
then past the screened goalie, Chris Studernafer. Fifty seconds later, Pitt scored and took 
the lead 3-2 with the last goal of the period.
The ice had barely been re-surfaced for the 
third period when Carnegie Mellon had al
ready scored two quick goals at the 1:05 and 
4:35 marks by Todd Henderson and John 
Blackwood, respectively. The Tartans domi
nated the rest of the period, until the final min
ute and a halfwhen the penalties started to fly.
Carnegie Mellon was called for a holding 
and a roughing penalty and Pitt was called for 
two roughing penalties. Both teams were 
skating three on three when, according to 
senior right wing Sean McGinn, It was just a 
mental error. Two of our men went into the 
comer. With a three on three youve got to 
play it man-to-man. When the two men went 
into the comer, it left one man open in front of 
the net. On top of that, Pitt had pulled their 
goaltender, so they had a man advantage. 
The game ended with a tie on a goal from Pitts 
left winger Mark Bowers.
With the exception of the first period and the 
final minute of the third period, Carnegie 
Mellon outplayed Pitt. McGinn said, Al
though we tied, I thought we could have won. 
The key for the rest of the season is to come out 
stronger in the first period.
Senior defenseman Rich Nave pointed out, 
We came out flat and had a good comeback. 
After we got up 4-3, we played to them. Its 
heartbreaking. We had the game. We had real 
opportunities to get it but let it slip.
Tartan Tattlers: The Tartans split a pair of 
games with Division III Niagara University 
this past weekend. Niagara shut out Carnegie 
Mellon, 2-0, at Kittanings Belmont Arena 
Saturday night, but came back from a 5-2 
deficit to win, 8-7. PHI Player of the Game, 
John Blackwood scored a hat trick in Sundays 
win.
Here, the CMU goalie makes a save against Duquesne earlier this season. The Tartans 
have done well on the ice so far this year.

Get Both Oars in the Water
CMU Creates Crew Club
** *
By KAREN SILVA
Tartan Staff Writer
Picture this: Youre up very early on a 
Spring morning. Instead of staring bleary 
eyed at a computer screen while the sun rises 
over Hamerschlag Hall, youre rowing on 
the Allegheny. Out on the river, even the city 
of Pittsburgh looks lovely as everyone is 
waking up. Sound pretty good? Want to 
give it a try?
Well, the opportunity to join a Crew Team 
has now come to Carnegie Mellon. The Uni
versity Rowing Club under the direction of 
Harry Printz, is here. The effort to get a 
rowing team began with a meeting in No
vember.
Since then, the difficult initial steps have 
successfully been taken. The membership 
roster now stands at 95 interested students 
and staff, and, as of Saturday January 30, the 
University Rowing Club has been officially 
recognized as a club by the Student Senate.
The time is right to start rowing. Many 
other school and community rowing clubs 
have already taken advantage of Pittsburghs 
three rivers. The Three Rivers Rowing 
Association (TRRA) is a civic organization 
that utilizes the rivers.
The North Side Development Council re
cently leased to TRRA a grant of land on 
Herrs Island (Washingtons Landing) to be 
used as the site of a proposed boathouse. The 
boathouse will be situated at a narrow and 
protected channel on the Allegheny and will
serve as a starting point for all rowing. 
TRRA would like Carnegie Mellon to help 
fund the project. The boathouse would 
serve as the center for all of the school's 
crew activity. *
Harry Printz, President of the University 
Rowing Club, is also a member of TRRA. 
Printz has been behind the effort to have 
CMU start its own organization, and sees 
the push to begin rowing on the part of 
students and staff as a homegrown effort. 
Printz hopes that someday rowing will 
become a varsity sport.
Jim Banner, the schools Athletic Direc
tor, pointed out that attaining varsity status 
is very difficult for sports in general. For 
this reason, crew will remain as a club. 
There is hope that someday CMU will be 
able to participate and do well in regattas 
and have a large recreational contingent. 
Printz sees no reason why this school cant 
have a successful program.
Since the initial meeting, the Board has \ 
been very busy preparing its presentation 
for the Student Senate, organizing budgets, 
pricing equipment etc. Last Saturday, the 
Senate did recognize the organization as a 
club and agreed to fund some initial operat
ing costs.
The Senate would like the administration 
to pick up the funding on more athletic fa
cilities, so the rowing club has to make a 
presentation to the administration in order 
to get underway.

PITT CONTINUES TO WIN
Despite all the controversy surrounding 
Ironhead Heyward and the Panther foot
ball team, the Pitt basketball team contin
ued their assault on the national champion
ship. This past week the Panthers de
stroyed Providence 90-56, and also won at 
Boston College Saturday. In other Big 
East play, the Villanova Wildcats took 
their first conference loss to the upstart St. 
Johns Redmen 60-55.
Pens Cant Congeal
By JOHN FIEDMAN
Tartan Contributing Editor
The Penguins returned from a four game 
road trip nearly a week ago. But frustrating 
losses to the Edmonton Oilers and Winnipeg 
Jets, plus an unsuccessful excursion to New 
Jersey, bore only coincidental resemblance 
to the game Pittsburgh had played when the 
Pens reeled off four straight road wins.
That road feeling came home against 
Chicago as Pittsburgh scored a 4-2 victory in 
commanding fashion. Rookie goalie Frank 
Pietrangelo, who won all four of those road 
games, was sharp in repelling 27 shots. Paul 
Coffey continued to rebound from his knee 
injury with a goal and two assists, while redhot Dan Quinn contributed a pair of goals.
Its tough to say what made the Penguins 
look so good against the Blackhawks when 
they looked so bad two nights before against 
the Devils. The realization that the last-place 
Rangers had closed within and had a game in 
hand, may have contributed. Owner, Ed
ward DeBartolos block-long limo parked 
conspicuously close to the locker room could 
have alerted the Pens that the grim reaper was 
in town, turning up the heat in an already hot
kitchen.
Most likely, the game was just another episode 
in the long running Pittsburgh Jeckyl and 
Hyde show. It is equally easy to believe that 
the team is either awful or pretty good but not both. The Penguins should be posed for a stretch 
of Mr. Hyde as the blueline corps has re
bounded from decimating injuries and three of 
the final four games before the all-star break are 
at home. Washington, the next team in, usually 
gives Pittsburgh fits, but following the Capitals 
are the Hartford Whalers and Minnesota North 
Stars, both fourth place teams.
Despite floating in the bottom half of the 
Patrick Division, Pittsburgh trails first place 
Philadelphia by only seven points and the sec
ond place Islanders by only four. Each team has 
about thirty games left in the regular season, and 
the race is far from over.
Pens Notes: The win against the Blackhawks 
was the teams first (and only) home win in 
January...Winger Warren Young was returned 
to Muskegon Saturday as Randy Cunney worth 
sat out the final game of his league 
suspension...Although he has only 12 points, 
defenseman Ville Sirens + 13 plus/minus is the 
best on the team. Lemieux is second at + 12.

While Trebek Goes Into 
Jeopardy
continues from page 18
chael J. Fox [Fox was on last years teaml 
asked me to play one time. I came out, I met 
all the guys. They let me keep playing. Im 
glad they do, its a lot of fun. They have a 
league back in L. A., that keeps us so honed 
to perfection. We are currently three 
games out with a 7-6-1 record.
Trebek included, They asked me if I 
wanted to participate. I had played about 
thirteen or fourteen years ago on a team 
back in Canada. Its fun and I wanted to 
come out. Its the macho thing and I 
wanted to see if I could still do it. 
Michael Keaton summed up the feelings 
of most of the players when he said, 
Where else can you get the thrill of hockey 
and help out a charity as well. The game 
was organized for the benefit of the Paren
tal Stress Center, an organization that pro
vides therapeutic and preventive programs 
for abused and neglected children. Players 
attended a post-game party and auction at 
the Pittsburgh Hyatt where signed items 
were sold.

Lady Tartans Terrorize in TwoStars Shoot and Score for 
Charity In PittsburghBy NATALIE HAWRYLUK
Tartan Staffwriter
Most basketball teams play better on their 
own court; but once again, Carnegie Mellon is 
the exception. The Lady Tartans took to the 
road this week, and came back with two im
pressive victories. Their victims were the 
Lady Bisons of Bethany and the Lady Wolver
ines of Grove City College.
Saturday, CMU travelled to Grove City, 
where the Lady Tartans reduced the howl of 
the Lady Wolverines to a mere whimper by the 
score of 66-53. The first half of play belonged 
to Grove City, as it jumped out to an early 5-0 
lead. The chances the Lady Tartans took on 
defense paid off, as they forced the Lady 
Wolverines to turn the ball over a total of 40 
times during the afternoon. Grove City closed 
out the first half with a 13-2 scoring run, taking 
a 36-31 lead into the locker room.
The second half saw the Lady Tartans take 
complete control of the game. Their tenacious 
defense only relinquished 17 points, while 
CMU scored over twice as many. Grove City, 
however, held the advantage when it came to 
crashing the boards, pulling down 52 rebounds 
to CMUs 30. Leading scorers for Carnegie 
Mellon were junior Lisa Lightner with 22 
points and sophomore Tricia Chorgo with 11.
Chorgo and junior Aimee Reber paced the 
Lady Tartans with 8 rebounds each.
Julie Irons and Patty Brain led the Lady 
Wolverines with 19 points and 20 rebounds 
respectively.
Earlier in the week, the Lady Tartans slaugh
tered the Bethany Bisons 85-67. Five CMU 
players scored in double figures - Reber with 
20, Lightner 19, junior Beth Virgin and sopho
more Donna Spicuzza 11, and sophomore 
Valerie Kwiatkowski 10. The Lady Tartans 
outplayed Bethany in every aspect of the 
game. CMU made 32 of 68 shots (47%), while 
Bethany only put in a meager 26 of 96 attempts

Tartan Staffer iter
Civic Arena  Two thousand fans, who 
arrived early to see the Penguins take on the 
Blackhawks,were treated to an exhibition 
game between the Celebrity All-Stars and 
local challenge team on Saturday evening.
The celebrity team consisted of stars from 
film and television, some ex-professional 
hockey players, and two Olympic Gold Medal 
winners. Coached by Kelsey Grammer (Fra
zier Crane of Cheers), the Celebrity All-Stars 
tour as many cities as their schedules allow, 
playing exhibition games for charities.
Among the celebrities on the roster are 
Jeopardys Alex Trebek, Alan Thicke, and 
Michael Keaton. The team also boasted Brad 
Park (All Star NHL defenseman for the New 
York Rangers and Boston Bruins and possible 
Hall of Fame candidate) and Eric Strobel 
(member of the 1980 U.S. Gold Medal Olym
pic hockey team). Their opponents were made 
up of local non-professionals and ex Penguins. 
Ex-Penguin Greg Malone and Blair Chapman 
played for the challengers.
The game consisted of a fifteen minute first 
period followed by a thirty minute second 
period. It was a game marked by next to no 
hard checking, a little finesse, a lot of laughter, 
a surprising amount of skill, and high scores. 
Nine goals were scored in a 6-3 Celebrity win.
The ex-pros in this game stood out like sore 
thumbs; they were the ones whocontrolledthe 
puck. Many of the celebrities, however, really 
held their own. Alan Thicke had to have been 
one of the fastest men on the ice. Michael 
Keaton also showed good puck control mixed 
with incredible enthusiasm.
In the game, the Celebrities jumped out to an 
early lead which they held for the rest of the 
game. Goals came from Mike Kelly (Beverly
Hills Cop II, Touch and Go), Michael Keaton, 
and Steve Giannelli (Cheers, Knots Landing, 
Touch and Go).
The challengers got on the board four min
utes later with an un-assisted, perfectly exe
cuted goal by center Bob Cupelli, representing I 
U.S. Air.
Cupelli scored his goal after he picked up the 
puck right in front of his own net and skated the 
length of the ice with Thicke hooking him the 
entire way. The hooking was so flagrant that 
in the pros not even Thickes own coach could 
have denied Cupelli a penalty shot. No penal
ties were called in the entire game, emphasiz
ing the spirit of the entire contest. -I
Early in the second period, Alex Trebek 
collided with challenger player that caused 
him to leave the game. Later, he was asked if 
he was worried about a possible injury that 
would impair his career. He said, "You dont 
want to jeopardize your show business career 
playing in a hockey game that isnt going to 
provide anything but a little bit of enjoyment. 
You try to be careful, but you dontreally thinlj 
about it.
Not a minute after Trebek left the ice did the 
celebrities score their fourth goal knocked in 
by Jerry Houser (Oscie in Summer of 42, 
Brady Brides, Magic). The final two celebrity 
goals came from Dave Coulier (Joey in Full 
House) and Giannelli.
The two ex-Penguins made themselves 
known as they each tallied a goal. Center Greg 
Malone scored unassisted, and right wing 
Blair Chapman scored with an assist by 
Malone, thus, making the final score 6-3.
The Celebrity All Stars play entirely for 
enjoyment. Many of its members are recruited 
through acquaintance of other team members.

(27%). From the charity stripe, Carnegie 
Mellon shot 75% (18-24), and Bethany con
verted 12 of25 (48%). The only areas in which 
the teams were remotely close were turnovers 
and rebounds. The Lady Tartans grabbed 65 
rebounds, led by Chorgo, who had 10, and 
Bethany had 55. Turnovers were closer - 
CMU 22, Bethany 23.

The Tartans Road Woes Continue
By STEWART LEVINE
Tartan Assistant Sports Editor 
Karl Maulden tells credit card owners, 
Dont leave home without it. Instructions to 
the mens basketball Tartans would be sim
pler, dont leave home.
Following Saturdays loss to Grove City (6- 
9, 3-2 Presidents Athletic Conference), Car
negie Mellon (6-8, 3-2 PAC, 2-3 University 
Athletic Association) is 6-1 at Skibo Gym and 
0-7 on the road.
Road loss number seven followed an earlier 
game the Tartans pulled out of their hats. 
Wednesday night against Bethany (3-12, 0-5 
PAC), the team's leading scorer Hart Coleman 
sat down after picking up three fouls in the first 
1:30 minutes of play.
Without their senior center in the lineup, 
Carnegie Mellon fell prey to the sharpshooting 
Bisons. Bethanys Ed Bozick and Ed Gal
lagher hit six three-pointers in the first 10 
minutes of play to pace their team to a 26-15 
lead.
Then the Tartans found another star. Junior 
forward Daren Moffatt took center stage as 
Carnegie Mellon ran off a 17-1 run over the 
next six minutes.
Moffatt took 15 shots from the charity stripe 
in the first half, converting 12 of those on the 
way to 22 first-half points. As the half ended, 
the 11 point deficit was now a seven point lead 
and four Bisons were in foul trouble.
The second half was cruise-control basket
ball. First, the Tartans accelerated to a a 20 
point lead. They held the lead there until 6 
minutes remained and then decelerated as 
Bethany started bombing from three-point 
range again. The Bisons got as close as 12 
points but end-of-game fouling allowed Car
negie Mellon to cushion its lead back out to 17. 
The final score was 87-70.
Moffatt finished the game with career-highs 
in scoring and rebounds with 35 and 15, re
spectively. Junior forward Darryl Long had 
his best offensive night in nine games, 17 
points while grabbing 10 rebounds. Coleman 
added 11 second-half points and junior guard 
David Sikora chipped in 10. Bozick led the 
opposition with 23 points.
The trip to Grove City was not worth making. 
The Tartans started slowly, as they had against 
Bethany; however, this time there was no one 
ready to lead the team back.
Turnovers killed Carnegie Mellon. They 
only managed 14 shots in the first half, making 
five of them. At the other end of the court, the 
Wolverines were 14 of 27 and owned a 34-20 
halftime lead.
As the game continued, Grove City was able 
to push its lead to 22. Finally, Tartan Head 
Coach Larry Anderson attempted the tactic 
that had worked against Hiram so well two 
weeks earlier.
The second team of Lewis Jackson, Harvey 
Beckham, Keith Morgan, Charles Vaught, and 
Charles Luckett came in to try to do what the 
first team could not do  score. The bench 
players fared no better though, and the regu
lars quickly trickled back into the line up. The 
Tartans fell, 63-49.
Moffatt led Tartan scoring for a secondstraight game with 13 points. Coleman added 
11 while sophomore Harvey Beckham had 9 
points.
After seven straight road losses, the players 
are searching for explanations to their prob
lems. Moffatt and Beckham agree their woes
are psychological. Moffatt said, Its more 
psychological than anything else. Its all 
mental, it just gets in your head, added Beck
ham.
Coach Anderson was more concerned spe
cifically with Saturdays play. Today we 
never got together. I dont think anyone 
played well. We werent mentally ready.
The loss drops Carnegie Mellon one and a 
half games behind PAC leader John Carroll. 
(12-3,4-0 PAC). However, Anderson doesnt 
feel the Tartans are out of the hunt yet. He 
predicts, Its not over, I dont care if we have 
two losses, its not over. Weve got to come 
through and win some games on the road. We 
just have to play better away.
This Week: Tomorrow night, the Presidents 
come to town. Washington and Jefferson is 
second in the PAC (8-6, 3-1) and is the only 
team in the PAC besides John Carroll which 
has played better than .500 ball.
The Presidents boast the PACs second best 
defense, giving up only 68.7 points per game, 
and are third in the conference in rebounding. 
On the court they are led by sophomore Danny 
Jones who is averaging 16.3 points and 7.6 
rebounds per game, fifth and second best in the 
conference. Game time is at 8;00 pm and the 
game will be broadcast on WRCT.
Saturday, the Tartans start the second-half of 
the PAC season, travelling to Hiram. In their 
first meeting, Hiram pulled out to a 17 point 
second-half lead before the Tartans could 
come back to win in double overtime, 77-71. 
In that game, freshman Lewis Jackson hit a 
Carnegie Mellon record: five three-pointers.
Hiram has not been able to recover from the 
loss of its star, Rod Swartz, to graduation. 
Swartz provided the strong offensive leader
ship that the Terriers have been lacking all this 
season. The Terriers are last in the PAC (1-15, 
0-5), and have the worst offense and secondworse defense in the league. Center Kevin 
Coleman is the lone bright spot on this team, averaging 12.5 points and 6.6 rebounds per 
game. The game at Hiram starts at 7:30.

Hart Coleman jumps for the opening tip off against Bethany's Bill Galagher last week.Tartan Swim Teams Sweep Blue Streaks
By DAVE WILLIS
Tartan Staffwriter 
Carnegie Mellons mens and womens 
swim teams both scored impressive victories 
over John Carroll in a dual meet last Saturday.
Led by two first place finishes from Whitney 
Foster, the men won handily, 101-72. The 
Lady Tartans won 102-78 and were paced by 
Francesca Crannell, who had three first place
finishes. Crannell set two school records in the 
process.
The men broke out on top quickly, with Paul 
Moran, Hal Levine, Yuji Furusawa, and senior 
co-captain John Olsavsky winning the 400 
yard medley relay in under 4 minutes. Placing ^ 
both 1st and 2nd in 5 of the next 8 events, the 
Tartans led 101-49, rendering the days final 
events almost meaningless. Senior co-captain 
Foster placed first in both the 100 and 200 yard 
freestyle. John Carroll won only three events 
in the meet.
The Lady Tartans faced more of a challenge 
from John Carroll than their male counter
parts. The Lady Tartans went on top early, 13- 
0. The Blue Streaks were disqualified from the 
opening relay which they had apparently won 
by almost thirty seconds. John Carroll closed 
the gap to eight points after winning the next 
event, the 1000 yard freestyle. Despite finish
ing second to John Carrolls Kim MacDougall, Carnegie Mellons Susie Kelley set a 
school record with a time of 11:39.95.
The ladies placed first in the next three events ^ 
to open up a big lead. Crannell provided two 
of the victories, in the 50 and 200 yard frees
tyle. She set both schooled pool records in 
the 200 with a time of25.65 seconds. Carnegie 
Mellon finished strong, taking three more first 
place finishes, including Crannells third vic
tory in the 100 yard freestyle.
In winning their half of the meet, the Lady 
Tartans avenged two losses incurred last year ^ 
at the hands of the Blue Streaks, including a 
narrow three point defeat in the PAC champi
onships. Their record now stands at 3-1, with 
the men undefeated at 4-0.

The women's swim team prepares to dive off for the 1,000 meter individual medley in the meet last weekend against John Caroll at the pool in Skibo Gym.
The next meet is tonight at Slippery Rock. 
Competition is scheduled to get underway at 
6:00 pm.

o George Gee To Play Skibo Ballroom Friday Night
By RONALD G. REDMOND
Diversions Music Critic 
Its make-believe ballroom time, throw all 
your cares away! A tune made famous by 
Glenn Miller and his Orchestra, during the 
time when big bands were popular and going 
strong.
0 Oh yeah, you might say, you mean back in 
the olden-days when there were [yawn] flutes 
and trombones and things in a band, and 
people danced the jitterbug. Those type of 
bands are dead, except for the junk I hear on 
my dentists radio station.
If you were talking with the energetic and 
talkative George Gee, of George Gee and his 
Make-Believe Ballroom Orchestra, who will 
.> be playing for your dancing and listening 
pleasure free of charge on February 5 in the 
Skibo Ballroom, your first sentence would not 
have been completed. George radiates the 
excitement and the triumphs of his band. He 
even speaks in outdated slang which one 
would expect to hear in a smoke-filled jazz 
club. This is my life, he says, I lead a big
 show  part of it. It goes back to the  show  part 
of the Big Band Show.
Yeah, yeah, you say, as if this guy was not 
biased about his own band. Is this MTV thing 
supposed to thrill me? Do you have anything 
else youd like to throw at me?
Yet if George Gee cant convince you to give 
him a try, how about countless raves from 
people all over the world who have enjoyed 
his music. The Make-Believe Ballroom Orchestr has fans of all kinds.
Though a native New Yorker, George has 
made Pittsburgh his home since coming to 
Carnegie Mellon in 1978. Growing up listen
ing to The Make-Believe Ballroom show on 
WNEW-AM and playing bass for his high 
school stage band created an interest in big 
band swing music which grew as he did. 
Coming to Carnegie Mellon, George brought 
this interest. He started his own Make-Believe Ballroom on WRCT-FM. Then one day 
he decided he wanted to start a band. He 
brought together a bunch of friends equally 
interested in music and practiced. They en1 There are two types of bands, the Mickey Mouse 
band, and the Hot band. We consider ourselves in 
the category of the Hot bands.
tered the 1980 Spring Carnival Gong Show 
and won. So, the Make-Believe Ballroom 
Orchestra came into being.
After graduating, George Gee and his MakeBelieve Ballroom Orchestra, grew into an 18- 
piece swing band, with two singers and 
George conducting.
This CMU gig is important to me... its a 
great homecoming for me. CMU has been so 
supportive of me, George starts with a smile. 
He then goes on to say that he has spoken with 
professors and students of Music here at 
CMU; he feels that the musicians here have 
inspired and taught him, as he hopes he has 
done for them.
George ascertains that Pittsburgh is a haven 
for jazz artisans. There are not only up-andcoming musicians, but older musicians who 
have not played in a while. These old masters 
of swing can help the bands development into 
a really great, cohesive jazz band. My band 
swings as one.
George accredits a lot of his success to his 
band, but he also credits to a great extent the 
fact that the great Count Basie once told him 
when it is darkest he should always persevere.
that swingin, jumpin-jive cool sound.George Gee doing what he does best 
Perseverance is the key to any bands survival. 
George took this to heart, and became the 
bands book-keeper, accountant, agent, pro
ducer, band leader, music director, nanny, and 
promoter. In the words of Count Basie; My 
man Georgie has a bright future in the swing 
business.
His band is made up of the best performers, 
coming from the best bands, taught by the best 
teachers here in Pittsburgh. These musicians 
work well together, and as their band leader 
says, they can really play. A lot of band 
leaders wont let their cats blow, take a solo, or 
really wail. I got good soloists in my band, I let 
them wail. They dont have to play the original 
solo on the record, because as much as I love 
the 40s, its still 1988, and you got to keep your 
musicians interested and jazz up the program. 
The two singers for the band, Sandra Dowe 
and Shorts Davis, are both brilliant. Unfortu
nately, the beautiful as well as talented Sandra 
Dowe (a recent graduate of Duquesne Univer
sity) could not, because of prior commitments, 
make it on Friday. Fortunately, Maureen 
Budway, a graduate student in CFA's Music 
Department and recognized jazz singer in her 
own right, has graciously accepted to stand in 
for Dowe.
Shorts Davis is the groups male singer. He is 
well-known in the jazz business. Bom in Sa
lem, North Carolina, he has toured with the 
Make-Believe Ballroom Orchestra since 
1983. Before that he toured extensively with 
the Count Basie Orchestra in the late 50s and 
also with Tommy Dorsey. As George confided 
to me, nobody knows how old he is, but he is 
still able to dance rings around anyone I have 
seen.
In their eight year life the band has achieved 
a lot. As Wil Haygood of the Pittsburgh PostGazette, May 31, 1984, put it: The 24-yearold Gee is a Chinese big band leader. A rare 
bird and a cool fellow. Gee bounces on his feet 
when conducting he band, unlike some band 
leaders who conduct with all the movement of 
a man waiting at a bus stop.
As Joe Williams, winner of the 1985 
Grammy for best jazz vocalist said to several 
young local musicians, including George Gee: 
Its not difficult to get people to play the 
music, but it is difficult to make people aware. 
The music we do is very specific, for a very 
special group. When what they do was at its 
zenith, he adds, referring to Gees big band 
sound, it was the most popular music in 
America. People were dancing to it, falling in 
love, getting married, having babies. They 
used to have it at school proms instead of a 
DJ.
During Andrew Carnegies birthday celebra
tion at the Civic Arena, Carnegie Salutes 
Carnegie,cancellations by popular CMl 
show biz stars did not stop George's MakeBelieve Ballroom Orchestra from staging a 
fantastic show. The Orchestra is also the only 
group to have played both the Allegheny 
Country Club and the new wave Electric 
Banana. They've played Mancini's, Carnegie 
Music Hall and The Meadows as well.
In Pittsburgh Magazine's (August 1987) 
voting for the best local band there was a tight 
battle between the post-punk sounds of the 
Affordable Floors and George Gee's big band; 
the Floors won. only by a couple of votes.
Recently, George and his band have been ex
panding their horizons. His success in New 
York is phenomenal. Their debut was at the 
Red Parrot Club, June 29th and 30th of 1984. 
They also have had success at the rocking Cat

band, and sometimes I have a problem differ
entiating 1941 and 1988.
^ Regarding his bands accomplishment of 
being the first big band on MTV and making 
the first big band video, 28 year-old George 
says: We are the closest a big band can get to 
a rock presentation youll ever see, without 
bastardizing the music.
When informed that big bands are dead, his 
eyes sweep the room and he sighs. You know, 
Ron, he says, big bands have never really 
j left us. Its just that people see too many 
Mickey Mouse-ish bands. There are two types 
of bands, the Mickey Mouse band, and the Hot 
band. We consider ourselves in the category of 
the Hot bands.
When responding to the false accusation that 
big bands are like the dentists radio station, 
George decides to define what he meant by his 
band having a rock presentation. Not only 
j does the bands music swing, but we move... 
a lot of big bands from the 40s, like Glenn 
Millers and Jimmy Luncfords, utilized cho
reography within the band, where horns 
moved around, saxophones stood up, and its 
not just done for projection, but its done for the

Cooper And Motorhead Rock The Mosque
Special to Diversions
Alice Cooperand Motorhead...two names in 
the music industry that either wreak havoc 
and fear in the minds of those unaccustomed 
to very hard and very sick heavy metal, or 
rapturous head-banging delight in metalmongers sincere. And sincere it was when 
this deadly duo hit the Syria Mosque January 
27 to a crowd known for its inherent love for 
music of the loud, ugly and fast genre.
Wonderland for Alice?
It was apparent Alice was the main event, yet 
it is unfortunate he did not satisfy everyones 
expectations of grandeur. His greatest impact 
was theatrical. The elaborate scenery of tor
ture chambers, chains, gates, webbed coffins, 
decapitated heads, rotting corpses, and the 
infamous guillotine no doubt offered enter
tainment and shock-value to the audience. 
Each song brought on a new stage effect, 
either people and props acting out the song's 
story-line, or Alice egging the audience on 
with small infernal bloodbaths. Yet aside 
from this carnival of horror, 1 wonder if the 
show could have sustained its magnetism if 
Alice had forgone the props.
Musically, Alice came on strong with an 
array of bone-crunching tunes such as No 
More Mr. Nice Guy, Prince of Darkness," 
"Billion Dollar Babies and Dead Babies," 
in w hich he went into ecstatic spasms, ripping 
the heads of dolls. He also had interesting 
masochistic serenades with a leather-clad 
sexkitten, a prostitute, and an imitation of 
Mrs. Cooper a la housewife during Chop 
Chop Chop and Only Women Bleed. 
Although most of the gimmicks were thor
oughly amusing, the music never seemed to 
grab you and. for most Cooper fans, the music 
was why they were there. But all was not lost. 
The highlight of the performance was during 
classic tunes of adolescent rebellion, such as 
I'm Eighteen, Elected," and Schools 
Out, when Alice proved that he still retained 
the magic he was known for during the late 
60 s. In this sense, the hypnotic quality of the 
music's pure and unbridled aggression overshadowed .show business.
From the beginning, Alice Cooper has al
ways been a disturbing individual. As one 
critic puts it, the perennial adolescent acting 
out his violent fantasies. His original intent 
was to shock the world with a new level of 
musical and theatrical mayhem threatening 
all convention. Yet it is debatable whether the 
Alice of today can match his talents with 
those of the past. Technical wizardry is no 
substitute for a lack of musical competence,
and Alice must learn that the 1980s expects 
him to expand his musical talents and de
mands that he grow artistically in a world 
where innovation does not come cheap.
Motorhead: Lemme Tell Ya
Wednesday last at the Syria Mosque, the 
heavy metal band Motorhead took Pittsburgh 
by storm with lead vocalist/bassist/speed 
freak Ian Lemmy Kilmister leading the 
charge. Known in the late seventies as the 
worlds worst band', Lemmy, drummer Phil 
Animal' Taylor and guitarists Wurzel and 
Philip Anthony Cambell - promise that If 
Motorhead moved in next door to you, your 
lawn would die'.
Known for their own brand of fast, blasting, 
 thrash  heavy metal, the show was, of course, 
incredibly loud. Thanks to a suprisingly good 
sound system, the music never became 
muddled to the point of inaudibility. The band 
dispelled any myths about them getting too 
old to thrash when they played some of their 
older tunes such as Overkill, Killed by 
Death, Bom to Rock and Roll, Stone 
Deaf in the USA, and Ace of Spades. The 
highlight of the show was a bone-crunching 
version of Eat the Rich from the new album 
Rock and Roll, with Lemmy growling at 
the audience to Cmon baby, bite that 
sucker.Aside from a few mistakes and some inde
cision as to what song to play next, the band 
was suprisingly tight and very enjoyable. 
With their minimalist approach to a stage 
show, Motorhead proved that you dont need 
props and gimmicks to put on a good show, a 
fact that Alice Cooper should have noted.
Upon looking back at the show, the billing of 
Motorhead with Alice Cooper was a mistake. 
Even though they were opening for Alice, it 
was Motorhead who dominated the show, and 
they made Alice look pathetic by comparison. 
When Motorhead comes back around, maybe 
they will head the bill, or at least open for 
someone who is worthy of them.

Personal And Political Art At Forbes
By EDIE LOCKE
Diversions Art Critic
Editor's Note: Due to an inadvertent error, 
the article reviewing last w eek s Forbes Gal
lery exhibit was not printed. We apologize to 
the author and to the artists who were the 
subjects of the article.
Opening tonight at the Forbes Gallery w ill be 
the show of seniors Elaine Erne and Autumn 
Farole. Both these women work in a variety of 
media and will be exhibiting pieces ranging 
from drawings to glass to video.
Personal and Political Art
Elaine Erne will be showing glass sculpture, 
charcoal drawings, and paintings. All her 
work, she feels, is related in certain ways to the 
disease epilepsy, which she suffers from. 
Erne's painting and glass are closely tied as 
they both deal with multiples and the idea of 
still life. The paintings are vast arrangements 
of brightly painted bottles while the glass 
works contain enough pieces to Fill a room. I 
think that all the bottles 1 paint have to do with 
the feeling of being lost in a crowd. I went to 
a big high school and I also think that CMU is 
large. You can start to feel even more lost 
when you have a problem." Erne Finds that 
often her color choice is affected because the 
medication she takes is also a heavy depres
sant, explaining, on certain days the drugs 
affect me more than on others and its then that
I find myself using darker colors which I might 
go back and change later on."
While her glass work also deals with mul
tiples, it takes on a more political bent. Im
interested in showing that glass should not just 
be considered craft'. It is also a fine art form 
so 1 try to take on larger issues with it. I keep 
away from just making functional vessels. 
Erne explains that she is a purist with her glass 
since she uses no color, saving it all for her 
paintings. She remarks, 1 like to fill up rooms 
with glass, maybe because it's dangerous. 
Multiples are a kind of obsessive force with 
me. I like to see how far they and 1 can be 
pushed and how perfect I can make them.
With the charcoal drawings Ms. Erne began 
working on last year there is a constant theme 
of suicide and rape. At first those drawings 
were just a form of therapy and dealt with 
personal relationships. It wasnt an intentional 
idea - then an obvious theme just began to 
emerge."
For inspiration, Erne looks at the work of 
Raphael Soyer and the relationship between 
his figurative lithographs and paintings. In the 
future she will try painting the figure for the 
first time and is considering transferring some 
of her drawing ideas to this medium.
Nightmares and Ambiguity
Autumn Farole will be exhibiting a video 
installation, metal sculpture, and drawings. 
Ms. Farole, who is a video major, finds that 
this medium most successfully interprets her 
themes of nightmares and daydreams with its 
own surreal, dreamlike qualities. My work, 
she explains, is a series of reincarnations of 
nightmares and while I originally started with 
video I have been able to transfer this idea to 
metals and drawing." Ms. Farole became 
intrigued with the concept of dreams last year
when she began work on a series of metal 
masks. Farole feels that before making masks 
her work had been too much on the surface yet 
she was reluctant to put herself out there for 
everyone to see. The masks, combined with 
video and dreams gave her a chance to present 
intimate ideas yet still remain distant. Farole 
explains, my work has always been really 
non-specific with a sort of weird, disturbing 
ambiguity. She has found the work of Robert 
Longo to be very influential.  I like his 
combination of images and its stop-action 
quality. He also uses ambiguous combina
tions.
Ms. Farole, who has a minor in sculpture, is 
attracted to metals immobility and strength 
yet is interested is making organic or human 
forms which deny that aspect of the medium. 
My work consists of things which are beyond 
the real or rational state of mind, Farole 
remarks. Also experienced in printmaking, 
she has been able to carry some of those 
aspects over to metal through etches and 
markings on the surfaces while the drawings, 
using mixed media with colored pencil and 
gouache, serve as an impetus for or stem from 
the metal pieces.
Ms. Farole explains that everything in her 
work now comes from personal references and 
she feels better about her concepts since she is 
being braver in pushing them further without 
being so reserved.

George Gee 
To Swing At 
AB Dance
continued from page Dl 
Club in Greenwich Village. At one such 
engagement George owed thanks to his 
friend Lionel Hampton for offering 
members of his band for replacements, 
as two of Gees members were missing.
Barbara Cloud sums up George Gee 
nicely. There is a joie de vivre about 
George Gee when he is standing in front 
of his orchestra. I was strolling through 
Equitable Plaza recently and there he 
was, swinging to the big band sounds 
produced by the musical group behind 
him. I have always loved the enthusiasm 
he shows and it always seems to be 
there, even on a hot, muggy afternoon.
The most recent surprise in the life of 
this band is the fact that Bob Finkel, 
producer of Taxi, Circus of the 
Stars, and many other hit shows, 
showed interest in making a sitcom 
about the everyday life of a big band. A 
CMU alumnus, he was at the Carnegie 
Salutes Carnegie celebration and met 
George. He conceived this idea with 
George and his Orchestra in mind. At 
first they went to CBS and the network 
liked the idea but they wanted to use a 
different band. So then they went to 
NBC, who is apparently very interested 
and are checking into the possibilities of 
actually making the show. Speaking 
about the sitcom and the acting, George 
said, Were a bunch of misfit charac
ters, everybody in the band... but youve 
got to be like that if youre gonna do it 
right.
During the summer the band has a Eu
ropean tour planned and they are also in
vited to a lot of jazz festivals, including 
The Greenwich Village Festival.
Again, George and his Orchestra will 
be coming here on Friday from 9 pm to
1 am.
You can come to our show and listen, 
or you can come to our show and dance, 
but the big thing is I want you to come 
and have a good time. Thats the key to 
what we're all about, says George with 
a contented air. That Friday night the 
Skibo ballroom is going to be the MakeBelieve Ballroom. You go in there and 
get a chance to romance, to be sentimen
tal, to be happy, to bounce. Being happy, 
thats the key... if your audience can 
leave and bring some of that happiness 
with them, then I know we're doing 
something right... The music makes me 
happy...
No one ever comes to see us and has 
walked away saying: Oh, I dont like 
that band. They leave saying: So thats 
what swing, big band, that jumpingjiveness is all about. I would say our 
forte is that swing, jump-and-jive, itdont-mean-a-thing-if-it-aint-got-thatswing type of music.
Im looking forward to swinging for 
everybody who wants.to come down 
Friday night at the Ballroom. Its defi
nitely going to be a good time, its going 
to be our own Make-Believe Ballroom.
The energy of George Gee alone is in
credible. You dont have to imagine 
what his energy is like while combined 
with that of the Orchestra because he 
will be here Friday. Make sure Jo go 
early to get a good spot to dance, or just 
to listen. The price is right, its free.
My band swings as one.

ance sale on strife. Its the kind of show your 
mother really likes.
The central character in the cast was Michael 
Landon (who else?) as Charles Ingalls, the 
patriarch of the Ingalls family. Charles ruled 
over his family like Landon ruled the show, 
inasmuch as Landon was executive producer, 
frequent writer and director, and star of the 
show. His wife, Caroline Ingalls, was played 
by Karen Grassle. If you were to see Karen 
Grassle out of character, you would not know 
that she played Caroline Ingalls. Their chil
dren were Mary, played by Melissa Sue An
derson: Laura, played by Melissa Gilbert; and 
Carrie, who was alternately played by twins 
Lindsay and Sidney Greenbush. Mary became 
blind after the first three seasons, and then 
became a schoolteacher for the blind. Laura 
became a schoolteacher, and married the 
brother of a fellow schoolteacher. This show 
would make you think every female in rural 
America in the 1870s was a schoolteacher.
The cast had many entries and exits in its 
ten seasons. Among the more curious was 
Merlin Olsen, who played Charles friend, 
John Garvey. Olsen wins a lifetime achieve
ment award for being the best Little House cast 
member that was an ex-Los Angeles Ramfootball announcer-flower salesman. Other 
curiosities are the three adopted children that 
the Ingalls family took in (not like they didn't 
have enough mouths to feed). The first was 
Albert, played by Matthew Laborteaux. The 
Ingalls found Albert on the streets of Winoka, 
Dakota, a city that the Ingalls moved to for the 
1977-78 season. (Oddly enough, just about the 
whole town of Walnut Grove decided to move 
there, also). The other two were Cassandra 
(Missy Francis) and James (Jason Bateman). 
Little House, along with The Waltons, started 
a rural kick that developed in television in 
the late k70s and early 80's. The rural kick 
was a run of shows whose setting was postCivil War, rural. Middle America. NBC ran 
The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams in the 
1977-78 season, and Father Murphy in the 
1981-82 season. Father Murphy's success 
hinged upon the popularity of Olsen, whose 
gentle giant-type character gained popularity 
in Little House. NBC is still trying to obtain 
success from Little House by currently having 
Landon and Victor French in Highway to 
Heaven. French played the character of Isaiah 
Edwards, a gruff man who befriended the 
Ingalls family in the latter part of the shows 
run.
The show has spawned some successes for 
NBC, but most of its characters havent hadmany successes coming from this show. 
Andersons biggest success besides Little 
House was playing in a dead-teenager film 
Happy Birthday to Me." Gilbert's biggest 
success was being engaged to Rob Lowe. I 
still dont know what else Grassle has done 
before or since Little House. Many other 
slightly familiar characters, such as the Olesons. Doc Baker, and Adam - Mary's nowI'm-blind-now-I'm-not husband - have met 
with such little success that most TV viewers 
don't know their names. So I won t bother 
naming them.
However, all in all. Little House was a pleas
ant show that you cant help liking, even if 
some of the strife is a little exaggerated. It was 
a nice release for most people on Mondays at 
8 pm, right before they watched the blood and 
guts action on Monday Night Football. Some 
of its longer two-hour episodes can be seen as 
TV movies on cable stations and in syndica
tion. But as for now, its not on network TV in 
any time slot.
Thats all for now. So, if youll excuse me. I 
have to go out to my garden. The 7-year 
locusts are making their weekly attack.
One movie dares to tell it all.
Oh, Charles! What shall we do? Marys 
going blind and Laura needs triple bypass 
surgery. The crops are almost all frozen, and 
what didnt freeze, the locusts ate. The adop
tion procedings for Albert have been held up
by that evil Mrs. Oleson, who is also suing us 
because Laura kicked Nellie in the shins. My 
rheumatism is acting up. Your bum knee is 
acting up. We need money to eat, pay for 
surgery, pay taxes, and feed the dog. How are 
Owe ever going to buy Mr. Edwards a Christmas 
present?
Problems like these were common-place for 
the Ingalls family on the NBC show Little 
House on the Prairie. This drama, based on 
the Little House books by Laura Ingalls 
Wilder, was set in the 1870s in Walnut Grove, 
Minnesota. The struggles that the family had 
to bear, their altruistic motives, and their suc
cesses in a time and place when success was a 
rare commodity made this show a nice pro
gram to watch, even though there was a clear

Animation Isnt What It Was - Its Better
By MICHAEL ROSE
Diversions Editor
What we think of when we hear the word 
animation is probably a theatre crowded 
with children, eagerly awaiting the exploits of 
Mickey Mouse in vibrant Technicolor, or 
perhaps afternoon syndications stars, HeMan and G.I.-Joe. Well, these stereotypes fall 
far short of the quality of material presented in 
Elr ci'l 8N'rPNh'w:Nho E:sPNrr oJ ANwKh'w:NO 
presented tonight and tomorrow at the Pitts
burgh Playhouse, and coming to DH 2210 in 
March.
The E:sPNrr is in fact a tour de force, a 
collection of award-winning films from many 
nations. Featured animation techniques range 
from the inked-cel animation familiar to Walt 
Disney fans through claymation, pixilation, 
stop-motion photography, up to the cutting 
edge of computer graphics. The 1986 Acad
emy Award winner is here, as are several other 
of the nominees from 86 and 87. There is a 
long (10 min.) piece from the Soviet Union, 
Break!, that uses remarkably simple clayma
tion to hilariously explore the parallels be
tween international detente and a boxing 
match, and gives us the second best quote of 
the show; Hasta Manana - Fight! There is a 
cartoon written, produced and narrated by 
George Carlin that looks askance at the world 
in a newsreel format, also providing the third 
best quote of the E:sPNrr; Animation... You 
used to go to a movie and see a cartoon. Now 
you attend a film and see some animation!
Carlin is quite right. There are 19 pieces in all, 
not including the previews for the Computer 
Animation Show and the Claymation Festival, 
and without exception they are superb. Re
gardless of the style, country of origin, or level 
of technology, all these pieces have a certain 
level of professionalism that sets them apart. 
The E:sPNrr makes for excellent watching for 
anybody even vaguely interested in anima
tion.
Included in the film:
Luxo, Jr., a 1986 Oscar nominee, produced 
by Pixar (formerly a division of Lucasfilm) 
and John Lasseter, a former Disney animator. 
This two minute computer-animated short 
broke new ground in the field when it was 
released two years ago. The enchanting story 
of a desk lamp and his playful offspring is one 
of the most complicated sequences ever pro
duced by computer and certainly among the 
most realistic. Also from Pixar in the E:sPNrr 
is the endearing short Reds Dream, about the 
show business dreams of a young unicycle. 
Pixar has become well known for its animated 
non-living objects that seem to acquire not 
only mobility, but personality as well.
Baeus, a new film by Bruno Bozzeto, direc
tor of Allegro non Troppo. Bozzeto subtly 
warps the traditional boy meets girl story line, 
for in this case the boy is a tiny blue bug. Video 
game aficionados take note - the music for this 
film bears more than a passing resemblance to 
the sounds from the game Dig Dug. When 
asked why so many of his cartoons involve 
insects, Bozzeto replies, Theyre easy to 
draw.
Your Face and Augusta Feeds Her Child, two 
cartoons that have nothing in common save 
that they both clearly demonstrate the odd 
sense of humor that pervades animation. 
These pieces may make you a little uncomfort
able, but they will most certainly make you

laugh.
Academy Leader Variations is one of my 
personal favorites. Remember the countdown 
that appears at the beginning of movies, 
8...7...6...5... etcetera with the circles? Its 
called an Academy leader and its on almost all 
films as an aid to the projectionist. Well, 
imagine what would happen if the leader were 
animated somewhat differently? This piece is 
so inventive its almost scary.
OILSPOT AND LIPSTICK is a piece from the 
Disney computer animation studio known as 
The (Late) Night Group. They have a style of 
animation that lends itself enormously to the 
characters, a sort of junkyard Lady and the 
Tramp. Lots of fun, and an interesting twist on 
David and Goliath to boot.
Finally, Snookles, a piece from Juliet Stroud 
that closes the film on a note of utter hilarity in 
the vein of some of the more eccentric humor 
of the other films. Telling anything about this 
would completely spoil the fun, but I can give 
you the best quote of the entire show, which is 
Hello... Im a baby dragon.
Dont miss Elr ci'l 8N'o* E:sPNrr of 
ANwKh'w:N* Its interesting, fun, exciting and 
offbeat, with moments of pure hysteria and 
adorable characters to boot. The E:sPNrr 
plays tonight and tomorrow at the Playhouse, 
200 Craft Ave., at 7:30 and 9:30 pm, and is
coming to DH 2210 in March. Its probably 
worth the time and money to go see it at the 
Playhouse just for the better sound and more 
comfortable seats.
Coming soon to the Pittsburgh Playhous% 
Film Repertory:
The Wannsee Conference. In 1942, a confer
ence was held in the Berlin suburb of 
Wannsee. There was only one item on the 
agenda. On that day, high officials of the Nazi 
Party met to decide the Final Solution to the 
Jewish Problem of the Third Reich. The film 
The Wannsee Conference goes back, with the 
help of reams of historical evidence including 
the notes of the meeting secretary, to January 
20, 1942, and shows us what happened at that 
meeting. The meeting lasted eighty-five min
utes, and so does the movie. The New York 
Times called it mesmerizing...unlike any 
other Holocaust film.... In German, with 
English subtitles. Runs February 411.
Manon Of The Spring, the sequel to the criti
cally acclaimed Jean de Florette. This eagerly 
awaited film will make its Pittsburgh debut 
February 12 and will run through March 10. In 
French, with English subtitles. Watch for a 
preview of Manon Of The Spring in next 
weeks Diversions.

Gene Loves Jezebel Coining To Syria Mosque - Up to Main Stage
Edited By DAN B1DWA
Tartan Music Critic
In the beginning, that is Spring of 1981, 
brothers Michael and Jay Aston left their na
tive Porthcawl in South Wales to start a rock 
band in London. Luck on their side, they man
aged to find a flat and land jobs at Londons 
trendy I.C. A. (Institute of Contemporary Art). 
They soon found themselves attracting a great 
deal of attention, setting hairstyle and sartorial 
standards which numerous others began to 
imitate. Due to his looks. Jay was nicknamed 
Jezebel. Michael became Gene because hed 
hurt his leg and was limping like the seminal 
rocker Gene Vincent. (Those astute readers 
who have figured out the importance of this 
discourse should explain it to those who think 
this is unnecessary trivia.)
The band evolved during 1982 as a very loose 
and experimental affair with a nucleus of Jay, 
Michael, and Ian Hudson, a guitarist friend 
from Wales who had also moved to London. 
Other musicians came and went, but the broth
ers themselves were attracting more and more 
people to their exciting, though infrequent, 
performances. When Beggars Banquet Rec
ords boss Martin Mills heard rumors of this 
charismatic twosome and their chaotic live 
show, he went to see for himself, and ended up 
signing them on the spot. The bands first 
vinyl, Shaving My Neck, was released a few 
months later. The bands membership stabi
lized, with Steve Marshall on bass and Dick 
Hawkins on drums, and their first album, 
Promise, was released in July of 1983, making 
some progress on the independent charts in 
Britain with its distinctly independent moody 
guitar sound (kinda like pre-pop Cure).
In 1984, the band went through some per
sonnel changes, booting Marshall and Hawk
ins in favor of Peter Rizzo and Chris Bell. They 
also did some recording in New York with 
John Cale; however, since the recording came 
between Marshalls departure and Rizzos 
arrival. Jay was forced to play bass for the
sessions. The tracks thereby werent what the 
band had hoped for, and were never released. 
Bell then was entangled in legal red tape aris
ing from contractual problems. He did play on 
the bands second album, Immigrant, in secret, 
but then disappeared under a barrage of litiga
tion, to be replaced by Marcus Gilvear. As for 
Immigrant, it combined the bands former 
guitar sound with a danceable beat, and conse
quently went to #1 on the independent LP 
charts, was well received critically by all sorts 
of important folks, and was the bands first 
American release (on Relativity). Michael 
then tried to cut the bands fame short by 
driving the car they were touring in straight 
into a roundabout, but everyone survived, in 
rumpled but generally undamaged states.
In 1985, the band began to notice some 
problems with Hudsons guitar playing, nota
bly that he wasnt bothering to bring it to the 
bands gigs. The situation was resolved when 
Hudson left in the middle of the bands first
American tour. He was replaced with James 
Stevenson, and the tour continued with only 
minor difficulties, like bailing the drummer 
out of jail in Berkeley and finding a new tour 
manager after the old one quit after three 
weeks.
Back in England by Christmas Eve, the band 
was then whisked off to Ibiza, and then back to 
England, to record their third album, Discover, 
a less distinctive but more popular album 
which was received with great acclaim in 
England and a bit less fanfare in America. The 
album produced the bands breakthrough 
single, Desire, and led to extensive touring 
of the U.K., the U.S., and Japan, as well as 
elevating the bands reputation to Screaming 
Girl Fan status.
The band has since rewelcomed Bell, newly 
emergent from all legal troubles, to the band, 
recorded and released their fourth album, The 
House of Dolls (which, incidentally, is a pretty 
dull album - the band has succeeded in remov
ing most of the individuality from their 
sound), toured with Echo and the Bunnymen 
and New Order in the Fabulous New Wave 
Road Show Extravaganza of last year, and 
made plans to play the cultural mecca of Pitts
burgh on Friday, February 5, at the Syria 
Mosque. And so it goes.
IMPORTANT NOTE: The show has been 
moved from the Mosque ballroom to the main ^ 
theatre. Unlike the ballroom, the main theatre 
has numbered seats. As a result, anyone who 
has tickets purchased prior to the announced 
move should take their tickets to the Mosque 
box office to exchange them for the right type.
In other words, if your ticket doesnt have a 
seat number on it, you should exchange it for 
one that does. Speed is also advisable, since , 
those who exchange their tickets last will end 
up sitting in the rotten view-obstructed 
seats. Plenty of tickets are still available for 
those who dont have one of either flavor yet, 
so dont worry.
River City Brass Band Heading Down Under
By RONALD G. REDMOND
Diversions Sw ing Critic
What can you do the day after you have seen 
George Gee and his Make-Believe Ballroom 
Orchestra? If you liked that music you might 
like the River City Brass Band, although they 
tend towards a more classical tone than Gee. 
The RCBB, like Gee, is a young group stead
fastly holding the place at the top of their field 
as the best brass band in the country.
This concert at Carnegie Music Hall on 
Saturday, February 6 starting at 8 pm is a 
landmark concert in the near future of the 
RCBB. This is the last concert that they will 
hold before their Australian tour.
They have been invited to the Bicentennial 
of Australia by the American Australian 
Bicentennial Foundation. In addition to the 
performance dates in Australia, they will play 
four dates in Hawaii before heading to the
Australian celebration, and then end the tour 
with one date in New Zealand.
Though they leave for Australia after the 
February 6th concert, this concert only opens 
the bands 1988 winter series. In this concert 
the River City Brass Band presents Return 
To Paradise. This musical cruise to far-off 
lands sets the stage for the Australian tour, as 
well as giving the audience a taste of what is 
going to be played in Australia.
Waltzing Matilda is the song most often 
identified with Australia, but this song, by 
Gordon Langford, will not be played on the 
Australian tour; Langford is represented on 
the tour with two other songs. Zelda, by 
Percy Code, will be played on the tour as well 
as in the concert, with Joseph Zubach soloing 
on the Euphonium both here and in Australia. 
Three Folksong Settings, by Percy Grain
ger (some of which will be recognized) will
be played both times, as well as Alexander 
Lithgows Victoria March. Code, The ^ 
Digger March, and Langford, An Austra
lian Fantasy, will be represented by these 
two songs in the concert and in Austrailia. 
The River City Serenade, by Phillip 
Sparke, will also be premiered at this concert, 
and then brought to Australia, as will a South 
Pacific Medley, by Richard Rodgers (Arr. 
by Robert Bemat.)
Mancinis love theme from The Thom 
Birds will be featured as well as the Maori 
Song of Farewell (Now is the Hour) by 
Clement Scott, which is an audience singalong. As always, the audience will be al
lowed to choose their encore.
Ticket prices are $15, $11, $8, $7, seniors/ 
students $4. It is advisable to call first by 
phoning 322-RCBB, because there is a ten
dency for these concerts to be sold out early on.

Gold Diggers of 1933
Yet another old musical, with the required Busby Berkeley production numbers, this one 
dealing with the sad plight of unemployed chorines (women in a chorus line, for those of 
you too lazy to look it up). Actually, this is a parody of how most musicals of the time were 
ignoring the Depression. It was made by Warner Bros., one of the few studios of the time 
to pay any attention to the countrys social problems. Considering the type of movie it is, 
their trials never get too tribulating, and everyone gets what they deserve (Ha-Ha, no 
spoilers here!).

Pink Floyd - The Wall
One of the prime movies of the college experience, writer Roger Waters and director 
Alan Parker present an unsettling view of the life of a rock star from the center of his life, 
with flashbacks both forward and back. An extremely powerful film combining animation 
by Gerald Scarfe with Peter Bizous impressive cinematography. Based on the Pink Floyd 
album that came first. A movie that everyone should see at least once.
Starring: Bob Geldof, Eleanor David, Christine Hargreaves, Bob Hoskins

Cant Buy Me Love
John Hughes didnt make this movie, but he could have. Its the enthralling tale of a nerd 
who, in the mad quest for popularity and social acceptance, pays the Most Beautiful Girl 
Of His School to go out with him. Guess what - it works! And, in the fine tradition of these 
silly movies, she falls for him in the end, but not until both have gone through a great deal 
of Heartrending Strife. If youve been living in a cave and havent seen any of these movies, 
this is the cheapest way, but it might not be worth the time.

Dawn of the Dead
The night is over, and the survivors hole up in Monroeville Mall to escape from the 
zombies. The film does have a message of sorts, since the four survivors create a new 
society, but it gets somewhat submerged beneath all the violence Romero unleashes. Tom 
Savini provides highly convincing special effects, and the zombies do whatever zombies 
do best (eat people, I suppose). A great horror flick of the slash and splash variety. 
Starring: David Emge, Ken Foree, Scott Reiniger, Gaylen Ross

Big River Floods Heinz Hall
By STEPHANIE REEDY
Diversions Staffwriter 
The second National Touring Company of 
Broadways hit musical Big River opened at 
the Pittsburgh Symphonys Heinz Hall on 
Tuesday, January 26th and ran through this 
past Sunday. In its Pittsburgh premiere the 
play was excellently received by audiences 
and critics alike.
The story of Big River is taken from Mark 
Twains The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, 
in which a young boy and a runaway slave 
travel down the Mississippi River in search of 
adventure and freedom. Through the experi
ences they have together they overcome their 
differences and are able to become close 
friends.
The play opens with Mark Twain himself on
stage and Huckleberry Finn comes on to intro
duce him and the other main characters of the 
show. Huck Finns role is crucial to the play 
because he tells us the story of his own adven
tures and the audience is forced to see things in 
the same light as he does.
The first few scenes of the play take place in 
St. Petersburg, Missouri and set up 
Huckleberrys situation with the Widow 
Douglas and his father, Pap Finn. Despite the 
fact that they are a necessary part of the show, 
the musical numbers are less than memorable. 
Although well-written and perfectly per
formed, the songs dont go beyond being 
mildly entertaining.
The better part of the show begins with Huck 
and Jims decision to leave St. Petersburg and 
escape down the Mississippi on a makeshift 
raft. This leads into the upbeat song Muddy 
Water and the audiences first view of the 
Mississippi River recreated on stage. The 
scenery is breathtaking and is an amazingly 
good portrayal of the river.
The remainder of the show deals with the ad
ventures that Jim and Huck go through in their
travels down the Mississippi, and the friend
ship that evolves from their experience. They 
meet up with two scoundrels, The Duke and 
The King, who pull them into their schemes to 
trick the innocent and get away with their 
money. The four travelers end up in Hillsboro, 
Arkansas, where the scoundrels steal away the 
innocent and trusting Mary Jane Wilkes in
heritance money, and sell Jim back to slave 
traders.
Huckleberrys conscience has been bother
ing him about being friends with a runaway 
slave, but he decides that hed rather risk going 
to hell by helping Jim get his freedom back 
than stand by and do nothing. The play ends on 
a happy note with Jim attaining his freedom 
and Hucks decision to go exploring the Wild 
Frontier.
The actors portraying Jim and Huck (Mi
chael Edward Stevens and Romain Fruge) 
work very well together and their voices blend 
well in their duets. Their growing friendship is 
touching as they sing River in the Rain 
together while floating down the river, but sad 
as well when they realize how different they 
are. In the song Worlds Apart, they realize 
that there are some differences that even 
friendship cannot overcome.
Michael Edward-Stevenss voice in particu
lar is extremely well-developed and has an 
extraordinary tone quality which sails over the 
other voices in the show, even during full 
company numbers. His performance of Free 
At Last was fantastic, the emotion in his voice 
making the audience feel his need for freedom 
in a very personal way.
Fruges portrayal of Huck Finn is an excel
lent one. He is full of the energy and excite
ment of the character that is needed to keep the 
show rolling. Fruge was obviously comfort
able with the role of Huck Finn, having played 
the same role on Broadway, but seemed too

Joe Bobs Advice To Jimmy The Greek - I Never Even Noticed
* Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, 
what are we gonna DO with you, boy? You 
cant go on the radio in Dee Cee and say 
black people have thighs the size of Libya 
and almost everybody that plays pro sports 
has darker skin than Jayne Kennedy. We are 
into some SERIOUS media probs here, 
Jimbo. You are obviously in need of the Joe 
Bob Briggs Rehabilitation-for-Accused*3igots Therapy which means, first off, you 
got to drive to Tulsa and ask Oral Roberts to 
raise you career from the dead. Then you got 
to start intensive training, do a coast-to-coast 
radio talk show tour, and on EVERY
Joe Bob Goes 
to the Drive-In
SINGLE PROGRAM you appear on. I want 
you to say the following things. That is, IF 
you expect America to take you back.
Numero Uno: Make sure the first thing you 
say is, I have absolutely no idea why the 
National Basketball Association is 85 
percent black. I never think about it. IN fact,
.  I never had even NOTICED it until you 
brought it up. Theres probly not ANY 
cultural reason. In fact, you know what it is? 
Coincidence. Its total coincidence. Itll 
probly all change over to 85 percent 
Mexican next year.
Numero Two-o: Say, Now that were into 
these unfounded racist stereotypes, let me 
make a second point. MOST Chinese people 
g are extremely tall. Its the narrow-minded 
bigotry of the white supremacist society that 
PERCEIVES them as smaller than us. 
Numero Three-o: Iranians are GREAT 
drivers. People should be required to take 
driving tests from Iranians.
Numero Four-o: You know what I love? 
The quiet modesty of the Eyetalian people, 
the way they never speak unless spoken to.
Numero Five-o: One thing we got to get 
rid of is the idea that people in Mississippi 
talk different than I do. I dont notice any 
difference, do you? There must be some sick 
BIGOTS out there spreading rumors about 
it. Probly the people up in Tennessee.
Numero Six-o: Polish people make great 
Popes, dont they?
Numero Seven-o: Its high time we had 
more Vietnamese in the National Football 
League. I dont mind being the first to say it
 these people are being treated like they 
dont have the physical attributes for the 
game.
Thisll get you back on TV, Jimbo.
Speaking of movies where you never 
notice what color the actors are, I saw 
Penitentiary III last week, starring the 
incredibly thin-thighed Leon Isaac Kennedy, 
and written and directed by Jamaa Fanaka, 
whos probly an Arab guy. Now one thing I 
wanna make perfectly clear right here at the 
beginning  it is JUST COINCIDENCE 
that almost all the prisoners are black guys 
and they always get beat up and abused by 
white guys. If we werent looking at this 
movie through bigoted eyes, then we might 
not even NOTICE there were black guys in 
it. So thats the last I got to say about that.
So what we got here is Leon being Leon. 
You know, its not enough that he had to go 
through the Big D with Jayne, but now he 
gets FRAMED for the THIRD time and 
tossed in the joint for killing a Meskin guy 
in the ring. (I didnt know he was Meskin, 
somebody had to tell me.) Once he gets to 
the Crossbar Hotel, he REFUSES to fight in 
the big tournament between the wardens 
fighters and the fighters owned by the silkshirt homosexual Mafia guy Serenghetti and 
his transvestite girlfriend. So you know what 
Serenghetti does? Sends a superhuman 
homosexual killer midget in chains to crush 
Leons skull with his thighs. But Leon beats 
the midget up so bad the Serenghetti says
Oh, poo! and orders his Cro-Magnon to 
throw Leon in the dungeon and give him 
electro-shock therapy until he begs for 
Petticoat Junction reruns. But then Leon 
starts to like living in the dungeon, cause he 
can keep pet rats down there and train a 
white saxophone player to box and some
times have sex with the directors wife. But 
then Serenghetti juices up one of the boxers 
with killer drugs and he almost kills the sax 
player AND mashes in his sax. This is too 
much for Leon to take, and so he vows that 
he wont rest until he beats the bejabbers out 
of a white guy with huge thighs.
Really  better than the original.
We got zero breasts. (Directors wife Fu.) 
Four gallons blood. Four dead bodies. 
Opium-induced rat killing. Aardvarking. 
Midget Yoga. Gratuitous four-part harmony 
in prison. Excellent gratuitous lesbian 
boxing. Kung Fu. Body Slam Fu. Dungeon 
Fu. Rat Fu. Electro-shock Fu. Drive-In 
Academy Award nominations for Rick
Zumwalt, as the giant Dolph Lundgren 
white guy, for saying You can flush your 
manhood down the toilet, the Haiti Kid, as 
the maniac homosexual killer midget with a 
crowbar; for the greatest fight scene in 
prison-movie history; Jim Bailey, as 
Cleopatra, for hanging around Serenghettis 
cell in evening dresses; Ric Mancini, as the 
warden for saying You have to fight 
Severe. They call him Severe because he 
whips  severely and You know what 
youre trouble is, Serenghetti? Youve seen 
too many bad prison movies; Leon Isaac 
Kennedy, as Too Sweet Gordone, for doing 
the entire movie in 20 words, and saying 
Now they made me do something I didnt 
wanna do; and Anthony Geary, as the 
weirdo transvestite gang leader, for saying 
You didnt win NOTHING, Too Sour, and 
Use the shocker on him. I want humble. I 
want broken.
Four stars. Best of 88 so far.

Book Review: The End of The Storm More 
Like The Start of A Weak, Cold Drizzle
By ERIKA L. PETERSON
Tartan Managing Editor
Touted by its cover and the publishers mail 
as a provocative and revolutionary new the
ory about human motivation, Nathaniel 
Howard's short philosophical book. The End 
of the Storm, sounded like it might be worth a 
couple hours of my copious free time. The 
book, 1 discover, is a kind of all around social 
self-help book, divided into four sections: 
The Eye of the Storm, Blue Skies, Other 
Matters and Afterthoughts, and Four Short 
Stories, each of which expound on a variety 
of, well, vaguely related topics. Howard, as I 
read in the promotional mail, wrote the book 
during a bout with a potentially fatal illness, 
which may account for some of its numerous 
shortcomings and the books general feeling 
of haste.
Part One, The Eye of the Storm, is the most 
serious section of the book, and seems to be 
the main point of publishing the thing in the 
first place. It consists of a theory about human 
behavioral motivations based on the ideas of 
a Dr. Arthur Teicher of New York, or Dr. Tas 
he is affectionately referred to. This theory, 
put simply, states that each person develops a 
shtick (Yes, that is Howards term), or 
pattern of unconscious destructive behavior 
in order to get revenge on the parent that 
wronged him as a child. This pattern, which 
can account for destructive behaviors ranging 
from getting frustrated while waiting in line 
(apparently Howard considers this to be neu
rotic) to marrying an abusive spouse. People, 
he claims, because of deep-seated anger 
towards their parents, deliberately fail in 
order to embarrass and hurt them. Curiously, 
even though Howard bases his theory of 
behavior entirely on anger, he debunks Freu
dian theory as being too simplistic because of
its heavy emphasis on sex. (Perhaps he 
[Howard] was himself repressed.) At any 
rate, Howard claims that the only way to 
release oneself from the control of this shtick 
and find true happiness is to forgive those 
people against whom you hold grudges and 
get on with your life. Hardly a new theory, but 
probably a good one. From there, however, 
the book slides quickly down that proverbial 
hill.
Blue Skies, the second section, describes a 
utopian political system based on (get this) 
Mafia structure, called Family Govern
ment. It would involve families of about 
100 people headed by a Godfather, who 
would be chosen because of their high scores 
on IQ and emotional stability tests (those out 
for revenge just wont do.) The Godfathers, in 
turn would have their own families on up to 
the highest level, three Elders. These Elders 
would be ultra-stable geniuses (Is there such 
an animal? - Ed.), and would control foreign, 
economic and other national policies. Sure 
its a pretty theory, and it would probably do 
much to improve the quality of our govern
ment, but lets be realistic - itll never be taken 
seriously, much less happen.
If you do read this book, skip right over
section three, Other Matters and After
thoughts. Its just a collection of this guys 
not too inspired opinions and thoughts on a 
random sampling of topics. Pretty dull stuff.
Part Four, finally, is a collection of rather 
poorly written short stories which are sup
posed to illustrate manifestations of his theo
ries. Instead, they are a bunch of contrived 
sort of existential stories in which the charac
ters sometimes spout parts of his theory ver
batim. Basically, they are pointlessly obscene 
or violent, and one contains a preposterous 
theory about neutrinos and mercury that was 
offensive even to a non-science major.
I dont think that we should blame Howard 
for most of the flaws in the book, however. I 
mean, he was a dying man and he just wanted 
to get his thoughts out before he kicked off to 
put it bluntly.
The editor and publishers, on the other hand, 
should be ashamed that they let such an unpol
ished and sloppy work get out. It only makes 
poor Howard, who probably is a really smart 
guy, look, to put it mildly, kooky. It is some
what interesting, especially in the first part, 
and one of the stories is kind of neat, but if you 
do want to read it, put it off until summer  
you neednt waste two hours reading it now.

Big River 
Flows Well
continued from page Dll 
clean-cut to be the traditional character 
one usually thinks of. His hair was cut in 
a style too modem for the time period, 
and he was almost too good-looking for 
the part. His enthusiasm and immersion 
in the role make up for this, however, 
and the show is enhanced by his ener
getic performances of Waitin for the 
Light to Shine and I, Huckleberry, 
Me.
The music of the show in general was 
well-written and well-performed, with a 
nice mix of Country and Western and 
Gospel styles. One particularly beautiful 
piece, The Crossing, was sung by a 
group of slaves and their overseer in a 
number of harmonic parts which all 
blended together to create a hauntingly 
sad song.
Other good performances include 
Barry Lees portrayal of Tom Sawyer, 
Michael Calkins as the Duke, and Jessie 
Janet Richards as Mary Jane Wilkes 
singing in a true Country style You 
Oughta Be Here with Me.
The costuming and lighting (recreated 
by the original designers) were very ef
fective in portraying the story and its 
time period, and the scenery worked 
well most of the time. The small orches
tra was enhanced by harmonica and 
banjo players which added a southern 
feel to Roger Millers well-written mu
sic.
Overall, Big River was a very success
ful attempt to recreate the story of The 
Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, and the 
combination of good music and per
formances made the show very worth
while.
