SEI protestor Vincent Eirene speaks on campus
SEI has funding restored
By BRYAN E. WONG

For the past year, students have wit
nessed the construction of a new build
ing between Wean Hall and the Bureau 
of Mines Complex.
This area known as Junction Hollow, 
is the location of the new Physical Plant 
Building. It is scheduled for completion 
by November 1988.
The building, with a cost of $8 million 
is part of the 1985 Master Plan by C.R.S. 
Sirrene.
According to Paul J. Tellers, Univer
sity Architect from the Office of Design 
and Construction, the Master Plan 
pointed out needed changes on campus.
The Physical Plant building, designed 
by Pittsburgh based-IKM architects, was 
built in the Junction Hollow area to 
solve two problems the Master Plan had 
suggested.
Tellers said the building connects 
the west end [from Bureau of Mines to 
Wean] together... and allows Physical
Plant to pull out of academic areas.
The building will house Grounds and 
Transportation, ABM, Maintenance Shops,
Maintenance Control, Environmental 
Health and Safety, and the Office of De
sign and Construction.
The design was chosen to tie in with the 
rest of campus and to make it compatible 
with other buildings. The building was 
constructed on an under used parking lot, 
where an academic building would not be 
practical because of its remote location on 
campus.
The building has arched windows and 
peaked roofs and the same buffbrick color 
as the Bureau of Mines and Hamerschlag 
Hall.
A walkway was built on the roof to serve 
as a cross connection from the Bureau of 
Mines to the ground level of Wean.
Since the roof is the only part of the 
building that can be seen from street level, 
the typical machinery and gravel found on 
a roof was removed. There is but one way
you can see the entire building and that is photo by Jennifer Sherer

Non-violent Confrontation: 
The Disarming of CMU  A 
Modest Proposal was the title of 
a lecture given by Vincent Eirene 
last Thursday evening in Baker 
Hall 235A.
In his lecture Eirene focused on 
his plans to fight SEI, his nonvio
lent methods, and the motives for 
his activities. The theme Eirene 
stressed Thursday was Do not
participate in the unfruitful works 
of darkness, but expose them.
Eirene has become well-known 
around Carnegie Mellon over the 
past year because of his protest 
activity against the Software 
Engineering Institute (SEI).
During the lecture, Eirene 
claimed that although SEI holds 
no sensitive, classified military 
contracts, he has been denied 
access to a list of all Department 
of Defense (DoD) contracts held 
by SEI, and implied that no one is
allowed access to such a list. 
Eirene contends that such infor
mation should be made available 
for public scrutiny.
Of nuclear weapons, he said, I 
think the power of nuclear weap
ons is not the fact that they can 
kill us, but the power of nuclear 
weapons is they can make life 
meaningless for us now.
Eirene remarked that lately, 
student awareness and involve
ment regarding his protest activ
ity has been increasing. He views
CMU students as responsive, not 
apathetic.
Thursday Eirene said that the 
aim of his lectures was to get 
people to love one another and to 
oppose SEI in a loving and non
violent way.
The driving force behind 
Eirenes activities is his antinuclear stance. Most of his lec
ture focused on his position 
against nuclear weapons and his 
opposition to SEI as a contributor

Academic Computing plans to shut down 
the TOPS-E network, the remaining TOPS 
network to which academic users have 
access, and the TOPS A network sometime 
towards the end of December.
A decision to turn off the TOPS networks 
was made three or four years ago when 
Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) 
decided to stop producing the DEC-20 
machine that runs the TOPS-20 operating 
system. DEC is concentrating on its VAX 
architecture as its primary large system 
product and, as a result, does not manufac
ture a direct successor to the DEC-20.
Accordingto Augustine, the cost of main
taining TOPS and the fact of not having a 
direct follow-on machine were major rea
sons for the shut down.
The machines themselves are physi
cally old and the cost of maintaining them 
goes up all the time, stated Augustine.
Augustine noted that the use of the TOPS 
network has been declining as people 
shifted their work to PCs or Macintoshes. 
Departments have switched to smaller 
systems such as MicroVAXes.
However, before TOPS could be turned 
off, Academic Computing wanted a way 
for people who did not have Andrew work
stations to be able to access both the mailer 
and file server.
This was the primary reason behind the 
purchase of the Andrew UNIX server ma
chines, which will allow access to both the 
mailer and the file server. There are nine of 
these machines, and they are significantly 
faster than the MicroVAXes located in the 
public clusters.
fh gdaVyusShg
With the Andrew UNIX server system, 
users will be able to log on from present 
TOPS terminals as well as telenet from 
their dorm rooms, which are on the cam
pus network. The UNIX server will allow 
users to run Andrew programs but users 
will not be able to use the Andrew Win
dow Manager.
The shut down of the TOPS network 
began last year with the shutdown of the 
other three TOPS network B, C, and D.
Of the three remaining networks, both 
A and F are administrative machines. 
They serve in admininistrative functions 
such as payroll, accounting, and student 
records. The exact shut down schedule of 
TOPS-A and F will be determined by the 
rate at which administrative functions 
can be converted to the new VAX ma
chines which will take the place of the 
DEC-20s.
The shutdown of TOPS-E was delayed 
by the conversion of programs necessary 
in two courses.
The two courses offered that require a 
TOPS account are the Philosopy 
departments Introduction to Logic course 
and the Math departments Mathmatical 
logic course. The conversion of the pro
grams is scheduled to be completed by the 
end of the semester.
According to Assistant Director for 
Hardware Systems Ken Burner, two of 
the $1 million DEC-20 machines have 
already been traded in for credits towards 
the purchase of two VAX 8700s, which 
cost about $800,000. Burner also stated 
that he is engaged in trying to get DEC 
interested in taking the three remaining 
DEC 20s for credits on future purchases, 
but has had no success.

Federal funds for the controversial Soft
ware Engineering Institute have emerged 
from a storm of Federal budget cuts for 
fiscal 1989 without a scratch.
Strong support by Senators Arlen Spec
ter (R-PA) and Senate majority leader 
Robert C. Byrd (D-WV) was largely re
sponsible for SEI keeping its federal fund
ing while many Other Defense Department 
programs received large cutbacks. Both 
Specter and Byrd view SEI as vital in 
advancing Defence Department weapon 
systems as well as economic development
in their respective states.
Last March, in the wake of impending 
automatic budget cuts mandated under 
the Gramm-Ruddman-Hollings Deficit 
Reduction Act, Congress threatened to 
decrease federal funds for SEI by over 40 
percent, from a reported $18.8 million to 
$10.3 million. However, later revisions of 
the budget in recent months restored full 
funding for SEI.
Carnegie Mellon President Richard 
Cyert said that the proposed cut backs 
would not have seriously hurt SEI, how
ever they would have caused the facility 
to grow at a slower rate. SEI would have

Iran-lraq peace 
talks moving to 
New York
GENEVA, Switzerland (DJ)  
United Nations-mediated talks 
between Iran and Iraq will be 
moved to New York this week, 
said Iranian foreign minister Ali 
Akbar Velayati.
The Sept. 22 meeting comes at 
the invitation of U.N. Secretary 
General Javier Perez de Cuellar, 
said Velayati.
The Iranian minister said his 
nation hopes the New York meet
ing will finalize the timetable 
which starts the withdrawal of 
the forces to the internationally 
recognized borders.
The Iraqi delegation issued a 
statement indicating they would 
attend the New York meeting only 
if a date for reconvening the talks 
in Geneva is fixed before both 
delegations leave the Swiss city.
The statement also said U.N. 
Ambassador Jan Eliasson was 
also informed that the Iraqi rep
resentative cannot be in New York 
before the first week of October.
The statement was issued three 
hours after Eliasson met the press 
following a brief face-to-face 
meeting between the two sides 
which he chaired and which he 
said showed a degree of coopera
tion which promises well for the 
future.
Mail shipments to

Gramm-Rudman 
budget cuts may 
be triggered
WASHINGTON (DJ)  Con
gress is tentatively on course for 
automatic across-the-board 
spending cuts of about $11.5 bil
lion, an Office of Management 
and Budget analysis shows.
The figures show that the legis
lature will have to trim pending 
spending bills by at least $1.5 
billion or find an equal amount of 
new revenue to avoid a seques
tration under the GrammRudman-Hollings deficit reduc
tion act if major anti-drug and 
child care measures are passed.
The Gramm-Rudman trigger 
for the coming fiscal year is $146 
billion, but that includes a $10 
billion cushion. If sequestration 
occurs, the ensuing across-theboard spending cuts would be 
tailored to trim the deficit back to 
the formal target for the year of 
$136 billion.
On Aug. 25, OMB released a 
report projecting a fiscal 1989 
deficit of $145.3 billion, or slightly 
under the trigger. But since then, 
the promulgation of certain new 
Medicare regulations plus re-estimates of the spendout rate of 
various other programs has added 
another $300 million to the gap 
between revenues and expendi
tures. That isnt enough room to 
accommodate the spending im
plications of pending legislation,
such as the drug and child care 
bills, Miller told key legislators. 
In fact, should such measures be 
passed, the deficit for GrammRudman purposes would be about 
$147.5 billion next year, the 
budget director warned. And that 
would trigger an $11.5 billion 
sequestration.
House passes 
insider trading bill
WASHINGTON (DJ)  An 
insider trading bill has passed 
the House by a vote of 410-to-0.
The House measure is signifi
cantly stronger in many respects 
than similar legislation currently 
pending before the Senate.
The House bill imposes a liabil
ity on persons who control and 
supervise employees who trade 
on insider information. The con
trolling person would be subject 
to a penalty of up to three times 
the profit gained or loss avoided, 
or $ 1 million, whichever is greater.
In perhaps its most controver
sial provision, the House bill 
would grant the SEC authority to 
award bounty payments to per
sons who provide information 
leading to the prosecution of in
sider trading violations.
The bill also increases the 
maximum criminal fine for indi
viduals convicted of insider trad
ing to $1 million from $100,000, 
and increases the maximum fine 
for corporations or partnerships 
to $2.5 million from $500,000.
In addition, it increases the 
maximum jail term to ten years 
from five.

Ashland charged 
in Mon oil spill
WASHINGTON (DJ)  Ash
land Oil Inc. was indicted on two 
criminal misdemeanor charges
stemming from the collapse of 
storage tank near Pittsburgh last 
January, the Justice Department 
said Thursday.
A Department official said the 
indictment charges that the com. 
pany illegally discharged certain 
pollutants including oil, into the 
Monongahela River near Pitts
burgh. The indictment alleges 
that the storage tank colla 
resulted in spilling more than 
500,000 gallons of oil into the 
river.
The oil spill on the Mononga
hela made water supplies temporarily unusable in a number 
communities near Pittsburgh.
The water supplies in Pitts
burgh itself were not seriously 
affected.The company is accused of vio
lating the Clean Water Act.
The maximum penalty for each 
of the misdemeanor counts is 
$200,000 fine or double the mone
tary loss caused by the spill.
Justice Department officials 
said the investigation is continu
ing to determine whether any 
Ashland employees or officials 
should be held responsible for the 
spill.
Ashland, responding to the 
charges, said it is disappointed 
that criminal actions will be pur
sued in light of Ashlands efforts 
to mitigate the spills impact and 
the fact that the company quickly 
accepted responsibility for the 
incident.
Ashland said that to date, it has 
paid over $ 11.4 million for cleanup 
costs associated with the spill and 
to reimburse claims from indi
viduals, businesses and govern
ment agencies.
Ashland said it has cooperated 
fully with the U.S. Attorney in 
Pittsburgh.
The company also suggested, 
The decision to prosecute Ash
land is in direct conflict with past 
practices by the Justice Depart
ment to pursue criminal viola
tions only in incidents of deliber
ate acts.

With the removal of the archaic 
TOPS computer systems, public 
demand for Andrew computing 
time is expected to increase dra
matically.
However, even with TOPSs 
phase-out imminent for over a 
year, Academic Computing has 
done little to increase its number 
of public Andrew workstations.
As of last spring, Academic Com
puting supported 93 public An
drew workstations, UNIX-based 
machines able to run the Andrew 
Window Manager and having 
access to the Andrew File Server, 
scattered over nine clusters.
Moreover, despite more classes 
requiring students to use Andrew, 
those numbers have not increased 
for this semester. Think about it: 
93 workstations for over 6,000 
undergraduate and graduate stu
dents is simply ludicrous.
As classes start to kick in and 
projects become due, finding an 
available workstation will be more 
than an inconvenience, and the 
Universitys peerless computer 
system will move from academic 
complement to hindrance.
We need more public worksta
tions now, before the problem has 
a chance to get worse.
As with any on-campus expansion, though, Academic Comput
ing needs to overcome its space 
limitations. The current clusters 
are filled and the University will 
be hard-pressed to dedicate any 
more space to computers.
Nonetheless, its a hurdle that 
must be overcome.
Vice President for Academic 
Services Bill Arms is proposing to 
put more terminals in the dorms.
Given that a majority of stu
dents live in on-campus housing, 
Arms proposal sounds like a vi
able solution, as long as he can 
come up with a way that students 
living off-campus can use the 
computers too.
In addition to space limitations, 
the University needs to concen
trate on supporting the Macin
tosh II as an Andrew workstation. 
Since H&SS has endorsed the 
Macintosh II, students should be 
able to run more than simple 
stand-alone applications; students 
should be able to hook into An
drew from their dorm rooms.
The University seems to be a 
victim of its own PR. It has spent 
thousands of dollars convincing 
the campus to use its state-ofthe-art computer system and now 
it has to follow through with more 
than words.
AtVVtu ahuah da du amtcs ainnSE
When you consider the little 
things on campus to which no one 
gives a second thought, its amaz
ing what you can discover.
Take the fence, for example. 
Everyone knows its broken. Ev
eryone wants it fixed. So why do 
the people who paint it continue 
to sit on it? One end is broken, so 
they move over to the next sec
tion. And as if sitting on it isnt 
enough, they erect wooden chairs 
so two 150-lb. people can concen
trate their combined weight on 
one spot. Theres very little wood 
left in the fence that hasnt rotted 
away. Try to make it last another 
60 years, guys.
An injection of common sense 
wouldnt hurt Dining Service. To 
begin with, the Tartan Grills spe
cials cost the same as buying the 
individual items separately. 
Whats so special about that?
Kilties policies must have been 
created by an intellectual light
weight, too. Did you know that if 
they are serving meatballs and 
noodles you can get meatballs with 
no noodles, but you cant get 
noodles with no meatballs? Even 
if you beg, plead, and inform the
server that you will throw the 
meatballs out so he might as well 
conserve them, you cant get just 
noodles.
Almost as bad is the rule about 
one entree per trip to the counter. 
If youre the only person in line, 
the server still wont give you a 
second piece of chicken; hell ask 
you to put your tray out of his 
sight and then come back.
Who is it who instills such terror 
in these workers that they cant 
exercise a little common sense?
Each year someone suggests that 
Dining Service label its condi
ments and ice creams, and each 
year they do itfor a month or so. 
And when are they going to find 
the right utensil to use for dis
pensing butter? Do they need to 
appoint a Director of Identifica
tion and Distribution?
All of these and dozens of other 
points are petty and shouldnt keep 
anyone up at night; but how do 
these inanities get by the great 
minds who run this university?
What we need is some good 
common sense.
And by the way, Wherrett has 
two ts. Get it right.

CMU doing noble thing in South Africa
Editor:
The gesture of Carnegie Mellon 
University divesting its assets in 
multinational companies doing business 
in South Africa is quite a noble one. 
Certainly there is no disagreement that 
the injustices to blacks caused by the 
South African governments policy of 
apartheid must be stopped. Certainly 
the United States and other nations of 
the free world should exert pressure on 
the South African government to change 
its policy on black cfitizens rights in that 
country.
However, the debate regarding 
divestment has missed the essential 
issue: is divestment the right means to 
help support the cause for black rights in 
South Africa?
Consider this: every U.S. multinational 
firm with South African holdings abides 
by a set of guidelines known as the 
Sullivan Principles. These principles 
mandate that blacks have equal rights 
within the company, with regard to salary 
and opportunity towards promotion. In 
fact, several of these firms have blacks in 
managerial positions in their South 
African divisions.
Ironically, divestment actually hurts 
the very businesses that are striving to 
make a difference in providing blacks 
with a just and equal work-place. The 
resulting economic and political pressure
1hsshca st smh Mgdstc
manifested by divestment will result in 
these companies selling off their South 
African holdings to other groups, 
especially South African firms, resulting 
in the dissolving of the Sullivan 
Principles. Consequentially, blacks will 
actually lose ground in their struggle for 
equal rights in South Africa, and will be 
faced with the same injustices of 
apartheid in these firms present 
elsewhere in their nation.
Furthermore, we must learn from our 
history. How many times has the U.S. 
severed economic ties with a nation over 
human rights issues, only to have that 
nation turn to the Soviet Union for 
assistance? The Soviets are all too eager 
to help them. Eventually, the Soviets, 
exercising their imperialist might, seek 
to take over the politics of that nation, 
and take away the rights of all citizens 
there.
Turning our backs to South Africa is 
not going to solve the problems of 
apartheid. If we want to make a 
difference, we must increase our 
involvement in South African economics, 
and use our holdings to leverage the 
South African government to change its
policies.
One such means of pressuring the South 
African government would be to have 
these firms boycott taxation, and place 
their taxes in an international escrow 
account. Such action would require full 
support of the U.S. government. This 
would strike a direct blow to the South 
African government itself, and would 
give it the choice of either facing the loss 
of revenue from profitable firms, closing 
them down (resulting in economic loss to: 
South Africa itself), or giving in to our 
demands. In a sense, this puts the 
 economic knife in their hands, and may 
prove to be much more effective than 
simple divestiture.
There may not be an easy answer to the 
problem of apartheid in South Africa. 
But divestiture is not the solution.
Furthermore, I find the actions of the 
Pittsburgh City Council on the matter 
most disturbing. Its' attempt to impose 
on the political policies of Carnegie Mellon 
University violates CMITs constitutional 
right to free speech and smacks of 
totalitarianism. I strongly urge everyone 
in the campus community to register to 
vote in Pittsburgh, and vote out of office 
those members of the city council 
responsible for these actions.

Grading system works, says professor
Editor:
Mr. Drout {Tartan 13 September) offers 
some definite views on the matters of 
testing and grading, offering some 
extreme anecdotes to illustrate his views. 
Evidently Mr. Drout has not been in the 
position of having to take his own advice.
Mr Drout advises that ...[e]xams 
should be structured so that they test a 
specific, objective body of knowledge... 
and he requests that we., .create exams 
that truly measure knowledge... It 
happens, Mr Drout, that we seek to meet 
these criteria in the following manner. 
In engineering courses, the structure is a 
sequence of topics, each exemplified by 
an appropriate type of problem. Exams, 
normally scheduled periodically 
throughout the semester, consist of such 
problems; the issue is whether the 
student can in fact solve each type. Given 
an exam of, say, three problems, it is not 
uncommon to find that students are able 
to solve one or two out of three but are 
feckless on the remainder. Its no wonder 
the dir tribution of scores is bimodal. Here 
the median can be anything, but it is the
distribution of test scores which allows a 
student to determine how well she/he 
performed. All of which is to say that a 
relative grading system is warranted.
With respect to grading, Mr. Drout, 
consider the problem: By semesters end, 
there are about fifteen bits of data (scores 
on exams and homework) which 
characterize each students performance. 
Somehow, all this information must be 
consolidated into a single letter grade. 
Each of us has his/her own algorithm. 
The example you-cite for Statistics of 
Deformable Solids  a course I teach  
is a patent misrepresentation of the facts. 
Heres what really happened: Following 
an algorithm announced on the first day 
of class, all the data for each person is 
consolidated into a single number 
(personally, I find it nauseating to reduce 
a persons work over the semester to a 
number), and this is a score, and not an 
average or percentage. A curve of the 
scores is then plotted and, depending on 
where each person falls on the curve, a 
letter grade is assigned.
Sometimes, Mr. Drout, the scores range
from over 100 to less than 70, a range 
that must be broken into four (A, B, C, D) 
or five (A, B, C, D, R) intervals. Where is 
it written that a ninety-something 
corresponds to a certain letter grade, 
does not correspond to a C?
Mr. Drout, may I suggest that, until 
you have wrestled with this problem for 
a few years, you withhold your gratuitous 
advice? Moreover, when you write about 
it, please get the facts straight.
J.L. Swedlow 
Professor of M.E.
P.S. According to my records no one in 
SDS Fall 1986 who got a midterm C 
scored 94. There is no such person. 
P.P.S.
A = Excellent 
B = Good 
C = Satisfactory 
D = Poor 
R = Failure 
which is implicitly a relativistic system 
using absolutes. Excellence is rare, as is 
failure. Satisfactory is common.
Feinbergs Macintosh II plan flawed
Dean Feinbergs plan to encourage 
all 1989 H&SS freshmen to purchase 
Macintosh II computers is premature 
and fails to take many consequences 
into account. Although there are many 
reasons why such a move would benefit 
the campus community, Feinberg has 
overlooked a number of practical 
fallacies in the plan. Despite the 
ambition of the project, it comes at a 
time when the campus, the curricula, 
and the computer market is not ready 
for such a venture to be successful.
The Mac II is a very powerful machine 
with a great deal of potential. It is
6hccE hchuhaa
much more than many students will 
ever need in their coursework. A less 
expensive package from Apple, IBM, or 
another company could easily fill the 
requirement without laying such a 
financial burden upon the student. 
Further, the $3000 base-priced machine 
does not contain enough memory or 
storage to adequately run the few existing 
educational software packages on
campus. (Pascal Genie requires 2 
megabytes of RAM and at least two 
floppy drives while the Mac at this 
price level only comes with one of each.) 
Any owner of a Mac system will testify 
toward the impotence of a Mac with 
such an emaciated configuration. To 
make the investment fruitful will 
require an additional $1500 in hard 
drives and memory.
Feinberg5s hope is that professors will 
write Mac software for with their 
courses. It is questionable whether 
such products will actually arise,

Silence is unheard of at CMU
Several days ago Phi Kap at the 
Fence and WRCT at Skibo 
managed to wire the entire Cut 
for a few hundred watts of sound. 
It was a shocking reminder of 
what a God-awful noisy place 
Carnegie Mellon has become this 
year. Its just one facet of the 
stressful environment of this 
University.
Much of the noise at CMU is 
standard fare for a Metropolis: 
beeping garbage trucks, the wail 
of Pittsburgh police cars, and the 
low rumble of jetliners. For a 
person from Manhattan, 
Oakland is a quiet place. At least 
one of my friends from the Big 
Apple has trouble sleeping here 
because its too quiet.
Colleges in general all belong to 
a specific genre of noise. Its a 
combination of a dense 
population of stereo equipment, 
chanting sorority sisters, 
marching ROTC raps, and 
weekend band practice.
But CMU has its own family of 
sounds. Familiar to all of us are 
idling MorePizza vans, the 
humming of Physical Plant carts, 
and the whine that mysteriously 
emanates from Warner Hall. 
Some of our classes are noisy too:
Mcdb NB 1hiSdhssh
music, dance, and woodworking.
A recent addition to the sound 
selection is the ubiquitous 
construction. The new Physical 
Plant building, the east campus 
dirt-moving, the Margaret 
Morrison renovation, and the 
vibrating Porter Hall all conspire 
against sleeping in class.
Music can be relaxing. Singing 
is pleasant. The cacophony of 
people milling at a party is 
reassuring.
Unfortunately, the stressful 
noise of Carnegie Mellon is 
tolerated. When a buildings air 
is polluted, like the University 
Computing Centers is, 
newspaper articles are written 
and experts are hired to reduce 
the problem.
But noise pollution is a subtle,

Expanding this idea further, 
having the University help

same classes to act as team leaders 
or consultants would only improve 
the learning experience of CMU 
students. This would be more 
valuable than all the study habit 
and stress management seminars 
in the world.

Fortunately, Ive had the 
opportunity to work for a private 
high-tech engineering software 
company  similar to the kind 
many of you are training for. The 
benefits of living in a capitalist 
society became clear to me there. 
I am now certain that the freemarket system is the best in 
existence.
I started seven years ago 
emptying trash cans. This 
summer I worked as a 
development programmer.
One day at work something 
clicked in my head, and I realized 
that this kind of business can only 
exist in a free-market society. For 
instance, the founder/president of 
the business started it in his 
house.
Previously, he worked for 
Westinghouse. He proposed a new
6hww Pycsct
software idea to them. They 
turned him down. In the early 
1970s, he left under good terms 
and started his own business. 
Freedom to work for yourself is 
one of the many benefits of 
capitalism.
While I was there the company 
grew from 25 employees to 130, 
over 500%. Not coincidentally, 
this tremendous expansion 
occurred under Reagan.
Even with a large staff, many 
still work a 70 hour week. Only 40 
hours are required, but people 
there work harder because they 
love their work. And they know 
that they will be rewarded for 
their efforts. They are responding 
to the profit motive.
The profit motive, contrary to 
Marxist philosophy, is the key to 
technological progress. The profit 
motive is not evil; the profit motive
is good. It is a powerful, dynamic, 
driving force. It encourages 
creative thinking and efficiency. 
People are forced to solve difficult 
problems. Nw technology 
flourishes under "capitalism.
Many businesses, and, yes, 
entire industries have started as 
a result of the profit motive. Some 
examples include sports,
entertainment, express mail, and 
many high tech and service 
industries. How many people 
work in these areas in socialists 
countries? Socialists systems just 
cannot respond to incentives the 
way the free-market system can.
I wonder how many businesses 
and jobs in America have never 
materialized because of govern
ment road blocks? Maybe tax 
levels and government regu
lations will someday be lowered 
enough so that everybody who 
wants to start their own business 
can.

however. Programming is a long 
and involved process that would 
take time away from the 
classroom and students, 
especially if such a package is 
given a deadline for completion. 
Large packages suffer from bugs 
and programming flaws that often 
cannot be detected until students 
lose their work in a system error. 
Pascal Genie, the program 
developed on campus for 15-lxx 
coursework, was an exercise in 
frustration for its first two years 
and only now, at version 70 at last 
count, is it reliable enough to offer 
to other institutions. It is not 
reasonable to assume H&SS staff 
will have any more success than 
the CompSci Department.
It is questionable whether it is 
wise to place so much emphasis
on one machine by one 
manufacturer, especially 
considering the money invested 
in CMLFs VMS and UNIX systems 
and Andrew. One may also 
question why the first freshmen 
to be placed under the project will 
be H&SS students when CIT 
would be a much more logical 
choice as computer-oriented 
courses already exist there.
Students will be burdened with 
having to transport, store, 
maintain, and insure a $3000+ 
piece of sophisticated equipment 
that they may or may not need. 
Security will be a problem as each 
and every freshman dorm room 
will house over $3000 worth of 
equipment. Software piracy will 
surely increase as well as the 
temptation to play games instead 
of work. The computer store will
have to dramatically expand its 
repair facilities to handle the 
problems of that will arise among 
1500. privately owned Macs.
Imagine what a dorm room 
would look like under this plan: a 
triple containing three beds, three 
desks, and three Mac IIs sitting 
atop them. Macs leave very little 
room on a desktop for any work by 
hand and a floor stand for the 
machines costs another $40 or 
more. Of greater consequence is 
the practicality of three machines 
for three people in one room. 
Surely one machine could be 
shared among the three, leaving 
two machines idle. In such a case, 
the student could sell his machine 
off campus at $4000, undercutting 
Apples retail price while making 
$1000 in profit. The Computer 
Store has noted many cases of

swimming, archery, and table 
tennis. Not that Olympic rifle 
shooting makes for great 
television, but events like them 
almost make you look forward to 
the Levis, McDonalds, and Were 
Beatrice commercials.
But how do the South Koreans 
feel about all this? Happier than 
pigs in shit is the colloquial 
expression. In fact, theyve been 
out parading the streets of Seoul 
for the past year and a half in 
celebration. The Koreans have 
built new stadiums, new hotels, 
new water cannons, and even new 
dams.
Building dams for the Koreans 
is like buying Cadillacs to impress
suburban neighbors. Once North 
Korea built one, South Korea had 
to have one of its own. Never 
mind the South Koreans dont 
intend to use theirs.
The North Koreans built a dam 
with the money theyre saving on 
bus fare to take their team to the 
Games. Actually, theyre a little 
peeved at missing out on the 
greatest party since Woodstock. 
They even built the largest 
stadium in Asia, using two years 
output from their steel and 
concrete industries.
To make sure they would use it, 
the North Koreans called up the 
IOC and said, either give us half 
the games or we aint coming. The 
IOC hadnt had that good a laugh 
since the Jamaican bobsled team.
There was the fear though, that 
the North Koreans could persuade 
the Soviet Union from par
ticipating. However, the Soviets
boycotted Los Angeles because 
they claimed their athletes 
wouldnt be safe. South Korea has 
more policemen per capita than 
any other country in Asia.
Therefore, the Olympic 
Committee countered with a few 
soccer games, rowing, and judo. 
The North Koreans balked and in 
an amazing show of East-Bloc 
solidarity, Cuba, Mozambique, 
and Albania will also skip the 
Seoul games.
So now the North Koreans have 
this dam upstream of Seoul, and 
the South Koreans have another 
just in case the North Koreans 
threaten to flood South Korea.
In all of the talk about dams, 
weve forgotten what the Games 
are really about: selling corporate 
sponsorships. The International 
Olympic Committee has more 
than 100 world wide sponsors of 
the Games. You can wake up on
Olympic sheets, brush your teeth 
with Olympic toothpaste, drive to 
work in the Olympic car, and start 
your day with the Olympic coffee.
The only thing that they havent 
been able to sell has been the 
official Olympic condom. Pity too, 
imagine the ads - the athletic 
prophylactic ... recommended by 
Soviet weight lifters, French 
equestrians, and East German 
womens swimmers.
Advertising aside, we all know 
that the Olympics are really about 
amateur athletics. Like the tennis 
competition, where the favorites 
are Boris Becker and Steffi Graf.
(Actually, the Olympics are 
about countries one-upping 
countries and money, just like 
the United Nations.)

have access to public laser printers 
and that in four years the machine 
will most likely be obsolete and 
have no reasonable resale value, 
the plan worsens when considered 
in the long run.
The day when all students use 
computers hasnt come. It may be 
reasonable to expect students to 
have access to a terminal that can 
use Andrew via remote, but the 
cost of a full system of the caliber 
of the Mac II is presently beyond 
the reach of reason. Before 
freshmen can be justly expected 
to purchase computers, Carnegie 
Mellon must do its part to provide 
a base of working, reliable 
software, public facilities and 
support, repair facilities, security 
measures, financial support, 
insurance, and a guarantee that 
computers will not interfere with 
the one-to-one interaction 
between student and professor or 
in any other way mar the quality 
of education. Only then can one 
honestly ask the students to make 
the sacrifices necessary to bring 
this idea to fruition.

On Friday September 9, Car
negie Mellon employees Dave 
Castelli and Mark Pintea saved 
the life of 18-year-old Scott Cloherty of West Mifflin, PA who 
had gone into a life-threatening 
; seizure of unknown origin out
side Skibo Gymnasium.
Castelli and Pintea, both em
ployees of Vending Services in 
Margaret Morrison Plaza, had 
just finished working at the gym 
, when they heard someone yell; ing for help. Looking back, they 
saw Norma Cloherty, a secretary 
for the athletics and physical edu
cation department, trying des
perately to help her son.
Without a moments hesitation,
Castelli and Pintea proceeded to 
aid Mrs. Cloherty. Apparently, it 
had been nearly a minute between 
when the seizure first occurred 
and the two vending employees 
first heard the cries for help.
By the time we got down there, 
Castelli stated, He looked aw
ful. Castelli immediately recog
nized that Cloherty had swal
lowed his tongue, so he reached in 
and freed it, restoring normal 
breathing.
Freeing Clohertys tongue 
would not have been possible, 
however, were it not for Pinteas 
assistance in keeping the victim 
under control. Castelli and Pin
tea then elevated Clohertys feet 
and wrapped him in a jacket to 
keep him warm.
According to the police report,
Sgt. Bill Ricci of campus security 
and student EMS Aijay Chatterjee were next to arrive on the 
scene. Ricci, who took Clohertys 
vital signs, said that by this time 
Cloherty was already conscious 
and was reasonably coherent.
Cloherty was transported by a 
Pittsburgh Paramedic unit to 
Presbyterian University Hospital 
where he was held a day for obser
vation and released.
There was other people 
around, said Pintea, but nobody 
seemed to really respond. People 
just kinda more or less stood 
across the street and watched. 
Castelli added Its the first time
I ever had to help someone,... you 
always wonder if you ever saw 
something like that happen what 
youd do.

had to cut back all research pro
grams and hire fewer new em
ployees. Also affected would have 
been plans by CMU to share tech
nological advances with private 
industry. The plans were designed 
to attract software companies to 
Pittsburgh.
Specter viewed the proposed 40 
percent reduction in funds and 
subsequent stunted growth of SEI 
as totally unacceptable. The pro
posed reduction prompted a vig
orous campaign by the senator to 
have full funding restored. As
pects of Specters campaign in
cluded writing letters to Sam
Nunn (D-Ga) the chairman of the 
Senate Armed Services Commit
tee and a personal visit last March 
to the SEI building, located on 
Fifth Avenue.
During his tour of the SEI facil
ity, Specter met with Cyert. Spec
ter stated that he is concerned 
with increasing the productivity 
of software production. Cyert 
explained how research efforts at 
SEI would help decrease the cost 
of software.
Byrd was also heavily involved 
in the campaign to restore full 
funding for SEI. He emphasized 
the military importance of soft
ware technology. Byrd has hopes
of creating a software valley in 
his home state of West Virginia.
Cyert said that he was not sur
prised that SEI had full funding 
restored in the final version of the
1989 fiscal budget. He said that 
when budget cuts were taking 
place, funding for SEI was 
merged With other items and 
the group was cut by a uniform 40 
percent. Later, when the budget 
cuts were revised,  individual 
items were given greater atten
tion. Cyert described the process 
the Defense Department used as 
going ahead and cutting a lot, 
then taking a second look and re
pairing the damage.

from across Junction Hollow, 
near the overpass on Forbes 
Ave. or near the Carnegie.
Currently, most of the 
Physical Plant departments 
have already moved into the 
new building.
The others are located in 
the Bureau of Mines Com
plex. The recent $8 million 
renovation of Hamburg Hall, 
formerly Building A, made 
room for more office space and 
classrooms.
Tellers said, The building 
is like a garage since it is a 
building for Physical Plant 
shops,... it does not need the 
prestige as the academic 
buildings.
In other words, the build
ing does not need to have the 
same quality like the resi
dence hall currently being 
built or the proposed Univer
sity Center, it serves a differ
ent purpose.
The designers wanted to 
keep the building functional 
yet traditional. They wanted 
to keep costs down while re
specting the integrity of 
Henry Hornbostel, the origi
nal architect who designedHamerschlag, 
Baker, Margaret Morrison, 
parts of Doherty, CFA, the 
Gym and the Bureau of Mines 
Complex.

to the arms race. He sees SEI as 
systemic major cities [arel 
becoming dependent on the mili
tary for economic advancement. 
He calls this analogous to a mili
tary takeover.
In last weeks issue of The Stu
dent Union, Eirene compared the 
activities at SEI to those of Nazi 
Germany, specifically the 
Auschwitz death camp. Eirene 
implied that the analogy had 
stirred up some controversy.
Throughout the lecture, Eirene 
continued that analogy and de
fended it. I really believe that if 
people have a chance to look back 
upon history, that theyre going 
to look back upon us as insensi
tive, as murderers, he said.
Eirene contends that he doesnt 
believe in any sort of violence or 
violent methods. He explained 
that the law symbolizes what is 
good, moral, and right and pro
posed that the only way to attack 
the injustice that is protected by 
an unjust law is to transgress
that law.
Following 
the lecture, 
Eirene an
nounced a ten
tative schedule 
of activities and 
events related 
to his protests 
over the next 
several weeks.
Every morn
ing from 8:00 
am. to 9:00 am., 
Eirene holds 
vigil in front of 
SEI. He admit
ted that so far 
no CMU stu
dent has par
ticipated in this 
vigil.
On OctoberEirene in front of SEI this Spring
15 and 16, Eirene hopes to have a 
campus showing of the movie 
Ghandi. Eirene will hold a fourweek, twenty-four-hour vigil at 
SEI from November 27th to De
cember 20th.
On December
11, which will 
be the one year 
anniversary, 
Eirene plans to 
stage the Grand 
Closing of SEI.
About twenty 
people attended 
the lecture. 
Most of whom 
were students. 
A few of 
Eirenes associ
ates were also 
in attendance. 
Although ex
pected, no 
members of the 
CMU admini
stration at
tended the lec
ture.
Though Eirene has never been 
a student at CMU, he is originally 
from the Pittsburgh area. Eirene 
describes himself as a concerned 
citizen about the activities of 
Carnegie Mellon that affect the
general citizenry, i.e. the nuclear 
arms race.
After the lecture, Bob 
McGowan, a friend of Eirene, com
mented that he had a great deal 
of admiration for Eirene. He said 
that Eirene has a heartfelt com
mitment and acts on that com
mitment.
McGowan explained that for the 
past ten years, Eirene has bought 
houses on the North Side, restored 
them, and then provided them to 
the homeless.
McGowan continued, I dont 
know any individual who can 
match that depth of commit
ment.
Eirene is affiliated with Dun
can and Porter house, an organi
zation on the North Side that 
provides help for the homeless.
Eirene has been actively pro
testing the work of SEI for about 
one year. He claims that slow 
progress has been made, but he is 
optimistic. In his words, in the 
near future we will see a tiny ray 
of light turn into a billion suns.

For those of you who have 
ventured to Kennywood Park, 
you know that it is much more 
than an amusement park. It is 
more like a piece of Americana 
where time has stood still and 
the people are as colorful as 
the rides. For those of you who 
have never been to Kenny
wood, you will now have the 
chance to see what the others 
are talking about.
On Wednesday, September 
28 at 8 pm and Saturday, 
October 1 at 7 pm, WQED/13 
will air Kennywood Memories,
an hour-long TV journey to 
Pittsburghs largest amusement 
park. The special not only takes a 
look at the history and charm of 
the park, but also takes viewers 
behind the scenes to see such 
things as the treasures hidden in 
the basement of the Penny Ar
cade.
Kennywood was founded in 
1898 as one of the citys many 
trolley parks that were popular 
then. These parks were used as a 
means to increase trolley ridership in the city. At one time, there 
were 13 amusement parks in the 
Pittsburgh area, but it was Ken
nywood that grew to become one 
of the nations great amusement
parks.
Today Kennywood has several 
outstanding wooden roller coast
ers, including the Thunderbolt, 
which has been named as the #1 
roller coaster in several national 
listings. Kennywoods spectacu
lar carousel is world-renowned 
and its Noahs Ark ride is the only 
remaining one in the nation. It is 
no wonder that today Kennywood 
is honored as a National Historic 
Landmark. ;
WQED producer Rick Sebakhas 
combined old photos, vintage film 
footage, home movies, and memo
rabilia capturing the magic that 
makes Kennywood so special. 
Kennywood Memories also in
photo courtesy
eludes personal recollections of 
people involved with the park 
over the years. Among these 
people is Carl Hughes, an 
employee of Kennywood for over 
30 years and the current presi
dent of the Kennywood Park 
Corporation. It is a great feel
ing to have a special like this 
produced. I hope its extremely 
well accepted, for Pittsburgh
ers have a soft spot for Kenny
wood, stated Mr. Hughes.
So take this special journey 
with WQED/13 to Kennywood, 
one of Pittsburghs greatest 
attributes. Whether youve been 
there or not, you will be in
formed, amazed, and amused.
CMU Philharmonic opens 
88 89 concert season
By CHRIS FECTEAU
Tartan Staffwriter
This Sunday night marks the opening of the 1988-1989 Car
negie Mellon Philharmonic season. Dr. Samuel Jones, named 
just this summer to the post of Director of Orchestral Studies 
at Carnegie Mellon, will conduct a varied program of works by 
Beethoven, Faure, Schostakovich, and Ellsworth Milburn. The 
concert will take place in Kresge Theater at 8 pm and there is 
no admission charge.
When asked about the diverse program, Jones commented 
that one of his first goals here is for the orchestra to be able to 
work comfortably in different styles. Serving educational goals 
will not be at the expense of the audience, though, as the pro
gram underwent almost a dozen different revisions before 
achieving a satisfying, complete menu for a musical meal. 
The flashy Festival Overture by Schostakovich will open the 
program,followedby Gabriel Faures incidental music to Pelleas 
et Melisande. Solus...Esto, a work by one of Jones former 
colleagues at Rice University, will complete the first half of the 
program. The remainder of the concert will consist of Beethovens 
Symphony No. 2 in D minor, a beautiful but seldomly played 
masterwork which demonstrates why Beethovens works form 
the backbone of the orchestral repertoire.
Jones comes to Pittsburgh from Rice University in Houston, 
Texas, where he founded the Shepherd School of Music and in 
a little over a decade helped to shape it into one of the finest 
programs in the country. He is credited primarily as being one 
of the best conducting teachers in the country, but is also rec
ognized as a fine composer and conductor. In talking about his 
move to Pittsburgh and to CMU recently, he called Pittsburgh 
an exhilarating city with a great deal of character.
He also feels a tremendous spirit of dedication on the part of 
both student musicians and faculty in the Music Department. 
The first few rehearsals with the orchestra this season are not 
his only basis for judgement, as he was here for six weeks as 
guest conductor in November of 1986. In that short period of 
time, well remembered by faculty and upperclassmen, the or
chestra played a brilliant concert, did a recording session of 
portions of a new opera, and was host to a workshop for twenty 
conductors from all across the country.
The Music Department at Carnegie Mellon has undergone a 
major revitalization over the summer under the leadership of 
Dr. Marilyn Thomas. The hiring of numerous new faculty mem
bers like Jone and the new Choral Studies Director, Robert 
Page, as well as the recruitment of a talented freshman class 
hints at a great future for the department which celebrates its 
seventy-fifth anniversary of existence this year.
The biggest highlight of the celebration will be a concert 
Friday, October 21 (Homecoming weekend) featuring the or
chestra and chorus at Carnegie Music Hall in Oakland. Watch 
in future issues of The Tartan for previews of that and other 
concerts and recitals by CMU musicians as well as by many of 
Pittsburghs professional music organizations.

The Renaissance and Baroque 
Society of Pittsburgh will soon 
begin its twentieth anniversary 
season. For those of you who are 
unfamiliar with the The Renais
sance and Baroque Society, they 
can best be described as 
Pittsburghs only organization 
dedicated to the performance of 
early music on authentic instru
ments of the period.
As in past years, the Society 
will be presenting another series 
of eight concerts, one each month, 
starting this Saturday. The con
certs will be held in Synod Hall, 
located just behind St. Pauls 
Cathedral and near the corner of 
Fifth and Craig Street.
The first concert of the season 
will feature the Pittsburgh debut 
of Englands Academy of Ancient 
Music. The Academy has toured 
and recorded as an ensemble as 
well as an orchestra. With over 
100 best-selling albums already, 
the Academys recordings of the 
Mozart Quintet and the Schubert 
Octet are expected to be released 
soon. The show is Saturday night 
at 8:00 pm in Synod Hall. For 
ticket information call 682-7262.
The October concert features 
the four singers of The Hilliard 
Ensemble who will be performing 
early sacred music. The Hilliard 
Quartet is comprised of a bari
tone, a countertenor and two 
tenors. They are famous for their 
superb sound, exactness of pitch, 
equality of parts and clarity of 
diction, even in four languages. 
The featured piece will be Duffays 
Lhomme arm, a mass based on a 
popular melody associated with 
William the Bold, the warrior 
Duke of Burgundy.
November will bring the Bach
Ensemble, made up of two harp
sichords and three soloists. They 
will be performing two Bach 
double harpsichord concertos, the 
Bach oboe concerto in E-flat ma
jor and the Vivaldi violin concerto 
in D major.
As an early Christmas treat, 
The Boston Camerata will fea
ture A French Christmas. They 
will perform Christmas music of 
the renaissance as well as other 
music spanning the centuries 
from the medieval to the baroque.
To start off the new year, Sequentia, a trio of medieval spe
cialists out of Cologne, West 
Germany, will display their abil
ity to combine vocal and instru
mental skill and bringing to life 
the music of 12th- and 13th-cen
tury England.
In February, Musics Recrea
tion will perform with interna
tionally known Catherine Turcoy, the Artistic Director of the 
New York Baroque Dance Com
pany. Miss Turcoy, accompanied 
by the four-piece Baroque instru
mental ensemble, will showpieces 
written for the great French 
dancers of the day. In addition, 
the group will perform Handels 
Suite from Terpsichore.
The seasons highlight, Henry 
Purcells English opera Dido and 
Aeneas, will be featured in the 
only Friday night concert of the 
season. The first part of this show 
is March 31 and continues Satur
day, April 1. The concerts are 
being presented in conjunction 
with a major exhibition by The 
Carnegie: Courts and Colonies: 
The William and Mary Style in

WQED presents Kennywood Memories
Eight MenOut da tu smh pyE
By RONALD G. REDMOND
Tartan Staffwriter
Dateline: Chicago  1919. Eight men 
betrayed their fans, their team, and them
selves. These members of the Chicago White 
Sox conspired with gamblers to throw the 
World Series to the Cincinnati Reds. What 
possessed these talented men to commit 
such a betrayal?
Now, almost seventy years after this 
unthinkable act, the production of Eight 
Men Out, an Orion Pictures release, tries to 
explain what happened.
The Soxs skinflint owner, Charles Comiskey (Clifton James) was so penny-pinch
ing that the pre-Series team was called the 
Black Sox because he skimped on the 
laundry budget. The ballplayers were per
haps the strongest team in baseball history, 
yet divided by jealousy into feuding cliques.
The gamblers who did the bribing swindled 
each other as much as they did the players.
The White Sox had a score of legitimate 
grievances against their owner, Comiskey, 
who liked to call himself The Grand Old 
Man of Baseball. For his team he provided 
the barest in living expenses, and to sportswriters and public officials he offered opu
lent feasts. Besides this the team members 
were outrageously underpaid. For example,
Cincinnatis best hitter was earning $11,000;
Shoeless Joe Jackson of the Sox, whose 
batting average far exceeded any of 
Cincinnatis hitters, was making $5,000.
The Black Sox Scandal hit the front page 
of newspapers and soon passed into myth.
Not until the 1963 publication of Eliot 
Asinof s best-selling book Eight \Men Out 
were the intricate details of the conspiracy 
revealed. The film was written for the screen 
and directed by John Sayles.
Sayles won the Best Screenplay Award 
from the Los Angeles Film Critics Associa
tion for Return of the Secaucus Seven. He 
also directed The Brother From Another 
Planet and Matewan. Aside from directing 
the film and writing the screenplay, Sayles 
also makes a remarkable appearance in the 
film as journalist Ring Lardner, one of the 
primary investigators of the scandal.
The 1919 World Series brought about 
massive changes in baseball. Eight Men Christopher Lloyd, Charlie Sheen, David its national premiere in Chicago this week. The 
Out is a film for far^s of intrigue and lovers Strathairn, John Sayles and Studs Terkel. film is expected to do well during the baseball 
of baseball alike. Included in the all-star Eight Men Out is scheduled to open in playoffs. Dont miss this true story of the darkcast are John Cusack, Michael Lerner, Squirrel Hill on September 30th, following est days for Americas national pastime.

Aria and Animation: Showing at Pgh. Playhouse
By DAVID LEVY
Tartan Contributing Editor
At the Pittsburgh Playhouse, 
this month there are two movies 
playing that are very similar and 
very different at the same time. 
Both are made up of shorts, or 
short films no more than about 
ten minutes in length, and both 
go to prove that sometimes less, 
in fact, is more.
The first film is Aria, a compen
dium of classical music videos 
that takes arias from ten differ
ent operas to make one movie. 
This movie has also been highly 
touted because it has ten differ
ent, excellent directors, including 
Robert Altman, Jean-Luc God
dard, Nicolas Roeg and Bruce 
Beresford.
Each director was given the 
same information: find an oper
atic aria and within time and 
monetary budgets make a short 
film giving an interpretation of 
the music, independent of the 
actual operatic storyline.
The result is definitely a thing 
whose whole is greater than the 
sum of its parts. Each individual 
segment is incredibly well done, 
although at times the interpreta
tion of the arias do get... well, 
weird.
The first segment is also the 
wraparound segment, or the one 
that runs throughout the movie. 
This one is directed by Bill Bryden and stars John Hurt, who 
does a fantastic lip-sync to Enrico 
Carusos II Pagliacci. The seg
ment lends itself to the introduc
tion of each of the other segments, 
but is disappointing when it comes
time to resolve its small plot.
The segments range from comi
cal to sad to the weirdness men
tioned earlier. The second seg
ment, directed by Nicolas Roeg, is 
a good example of the rest of the 
movie. The main characters are 
both played by Teresa Russel, 
Roegs wife. The ending shows a 
gentle comic touch that sets the 
pace for the rest of the segments.
The movie also takes a gentle 
shot at itself in Julian Temples 
segment where Buck Henry plays 
a wife-cheating producer who is 
trying to pitch Aria to a director 
during a phone call in the seg
ment. Dont worry about his wife 
(Anita Morris of Nine fame), 
though; shes staying in the room 
next door at the motel with her 
boyfriend. The highlight of this 
segment isnt Buck or Anita, but 
the opera-singing Elvis imper
sonator.
You may have noticed that I 
dont give much heed to the mu
sic. To be honest I dont know that 
much about opera. But this is the 
best part of the movie - even if 
you dont know much about opera 
the movie is enjoyable.
The movie does center around 
sex and naked women for a great 
deal of the segments, so it is not 
necessarily something that you 
want to take your youn ger brother 
to, but it is a great deal of fun for 
the older folk.
Animation on the Edge
Maybe its just me. Ive seen the 
Festival ofClaymation, The Com
puter Animation Show, Anima
tion Celebration, the 19th and 20th 
Tournees of Animation, and the 
LA Erotic Film Festival (which

A quick glance at the embarrassments inherent n buying a can of sex at your local supermarket in Instant Sex.
had more animation in it than 
anything else). Outrageous Ani
mation just wasnt outrageous 
enough to surprise/disgust/thrill 
me, but it is worth seeing if you 
havent gotten your fill of anima
tion yet.
In the tradition of the classic 
Bambi Meets Godzilla, Outra
geous Animation is a collection of 
animated short films that are*
either weird, sexually overt or 
just too disgusting to be included 
in something like the Tournees.
There is a great deal of good 
animation in this festival that fits 
the outrageous theme. One of 
Those Days is a perfect example 
of one of those days where any
thing can and will go wrong. 
Another segment called Instant 
Sex is about this poor shlep of a
guy who finds a marvelous new 
product on sale at the supermar
ket. Late Night with Myron is 
about the misadventures of a 
college student who really gets 
into a new 3-D TV system.
These and a few others make it 
worth seeing even if you have 
seen as much animation as I have. 
Some of the other shorts lose their 
impact if you have seen them
before. If you remember the LA 
Erotic Film Festival youll proba
bly feel like I did: that Outra
geous Animation was fun, but not 
as much fun as seeing the films 
for the first time.
Aria plays tonight through 
Thursday at 7:00 pm and 9:00 
pm. Outrageous Animation starts 
Friday at the Playhouse. For info 
call the Playhouse at 621-4445.

REVIEW
By DAN BIDWA
Tartan Staffwriter
The Bust Club has yet another new 
member. The Foundry, a.k.a the only 
worthwhile club to have opened up in 
Pittsburgh in quite some time, with 
Metropol not even coming close, got 
their membership last Saturday. But, 
hey, the po
lice were 
nice  they 
let House
coat Project 
finish part 
of their set 
before Naziing every
body out of 
the building. I guess those permits are a 
bigger deal downtown than anyone had 
realized because the cops seemed pretty 
het up about it.
Anyway, two weekends ago (one of the 
few weekends that the Foundry has been 
open and not gotten whomped on for one 
thing or another  that weekend the 
police just complained about the park
ing), Fourwaycross did their dark, JoyDivision-esque thing (not my compari
son, but sorta fitting). Last Friday had 
Six Gun Jury, the Pleasureheads, with 
their new drummer who is good, and the 
Heretics, with their (still) new singer 
who is an idiot. Or just acts like one. 
Housecoat Project put on a way cool half
set Saturday night, with a much bluesyer sound than on their album. They also 
did an equally amazing impromptu 
acoustic set at WRCT later that evening.
In all fairness, I did go by Metropol this 
weekend. Twice, actually, but the middleaged yuppies in sportcoats outside scared 
me away. Contrived seems to be the 
word Im looking for here, but, in all 
fairness, I wont use it. More later.
Nice week for concerts coming up, es
pecially if youre willing to drive a bit. 
Wednesday, the Ramones are going to be 
at the Syria Mosque, along with ego 
bombs Janes Addiction, who have the
most refreshingly yes, we know were in 
it for the money attitude since Kaptain 
Kool and the Kongs. Still, they were good 
when they opened up for Love and Rock
ets last year, so well see. The Ramones, 
well, theyre still the Ramones.
Thursday, Rapeman will be at the 
Underground Railroad in Morgantown, 
West Virginia. Fronted by Steve I Am 
Unto a God 
Albini, for
merly part 
of Big 
Black, and 
including 
drums from 
Scratch 
Acid and 
bass from 
Squirrel Bait, two bands that arent any
more, the band sounds like a mishmash 
of all three, with Big Black in the lead. 
Morgantown isnt that far away  the 
drive takes about an hour and a half, but 
its pretty straightforward. Find West 
Virginia University, then call the club 
(304-299-6873) for more directions. Its 
an all-ages show, so it starts at 6:00.
Nothing too wonderful on Friday. Stay 
home and do your work.
Saturday, there was supposed to be a 
huge fest down at the Foundry, with 
Scrawl, Happy Flowers, Cousin It, and 
Weird Paul, but recent events put the gig 
in some doubt. As a brief preview just in 
case, Scrawl play neato guitar rock with 
a bit o jangle, kinda REM style but not 
really. Happy Flowers do hilarious noise 
fests/songs with titles like Mom, I Gave 
The Cat Some Acid and All My Toys 
Hate Me. Cousin It and Weird Paul are 
two local bands/performers, both quite 
good, and I think this is Weird Pauls 
first show, so check it out. Again, the 
probability of the show is somewhat 
dubious, so call WRCT for more details 
later this week. Anyway, the Foundry is 
at 2930 Penn Avenue  its the building 
on the left with cows on the front, and the 
show is/might be $5.00 to get in. Hope for 
the best.
Baroque begins again

A walk on the red carpet, cham
pagne, and entertainment by the Con 
Spirito Woodwind Quintet were all 
features of the pre-concert party on 
Sixth Street in front of Heinz Hall 
Friday night for the opening of the 
1988-89 Pittsburgh Symphony sea
son. Despite a nose-bleed altitude seat 
(still a $30 ticket without a handy 
student ID) the concert, conducted by 
Charles Dutoit, held few disappoint
ments. It is not an exaggeration to say 
that it was the best Ive heard the PSO 
play in the four years Ive been here.
The one exception was the opening 
work, Wagners Overture to The Flying 
Dutchman. The piece was marred by 
insecure woodwind playing partially 
due to the orchestras unfortunate 
practice of saving some of the best 
players for the major works on the 
program. The story behind the piece 
centers around a sailor doomed by the 
devil to a voyage in a perpetual storm, 
but the storm I heard .Friday night 
could have taken a lesson from Hurri
cane Gilbert to give it more energy 
and excitement. A pleasant surprise 
in the Wagner, and for the rest of the 
evening, was the solid playing by the 
french horn , 
section, re
cently one of  
the weak
nesses in 
this orches
tra. I____________________
In the music to the ballet Ma Mere 
VOye (Mother Goose) by Ravel, Dutoit 
demonstrated his unmatched under
standing of the French repertoire and 
brought the orchestra into more fa
miliar territory (the Wagner overture 
had not been programmed here in 20 
years). Delicate shadings of balance 
were always perfectly executed and 
Dutoit was extremely successful in 
maintaining the simple character of 
the piece, originally a piano piece for 
two children. The woodwind section 
benefited greatly from a few switches 
in personnel after the Wagner, in 
particular the first oboe, for her solos 
throughout the Ravel were beauti
fully clear and light, in keeping with 
the transparent nature of the piece. 
Also notable were the violin solos of 
new concertmaster Andres Cardenes, 
who in addition to his PSO duties this
Classical Outlook
year plays a Y Music Society recital 
here on November 9.
The second half of the program con
sisted of Hector Berlioz Symphonie 
Fantastique, a programmatic work 
about the opium-induced dreams of an 
artist and his paranoia about the infi
delity of his lover. The 50-minute piece 
is much less interesting without know
ing the story, and from all the shuf
fling around and coughing heard from 
the audience, it was obvious that not 
everyone took the time to read the pro
gram notes. I have a feeling that more 
people would take the time if the sym
phony remedied the situation by 
making the notes more concise (these 
would have run 7-8 pages without ads). 
In any case, the performance of the 
Berlioz was better than any recording 
Ive heard, especially in terms of the 
dramatic character that Dutoit found 
in the music. The brass playing was 
solid and bright and the long oboe and 
English horn duet in the third move
ment was beautifully played. Large 
sections of the work occur where no 
two consecutive measures are in the 
same tempo and the biggest conduct
ing challenge is to not only to keep the 
orchestra to
gether but to 
make it sound 
natural (or 
supernatural 
in the
__________________ Witches Sab
bath at the end). Dutoit and the or
chestra succeeded brilliantly, captur
ing the elegance of the ballroom scene, 
the pastoral calm of the middle move
ment and, especially, the evil rejoicing 
of the witches over the death of the 
artist, executed for the jealous murder 
of his lover. Its a shame that this is 
Dutoits only appearance with the or
chestra this season, as his appear
ances in the past few years have 
numbered among the most memorable.
Next week the symphony is led by 
Yoel Levi in a program consisting of 
the overture to Creatures of Prom
etheus by Beethoven, the Chopin Pi
ano Concerto No. 1 with Horacio Guti
errez as soloist, and the Copland 
Symphony No. 3. Performances are 
Thursday at 8:00, Friday at 8:30, and 
Sunday at 2:30. Ticket information is 
available by calling 392-4900.

the popular National Public 
Radio series St. Paul Sunday 
Morning, as conductor.

of the world of classical music. 
The program for this concert 
includes selections from 
Tchaikovskys Symphony No.
4, Wagners Prelude to The Mastersingers, the Roman Carni

orchestra including music by 
Grieg, Mozart, Tchaikovsky 
and Mendelssohn. Soloists, 
conductor and programming for 
this concert will be announced 
in the near future.
The third Wednesday concert

Ride of the Valkyries (Apoca
lypse Now), Paul Dukass 
Sorcerer's Apprentice (Fantasia)

AB Dance had the blues last week, but...
Its time to rock n roll with the Magnetics
This Friday, AB Dance is hav
ing another dance in Skibo Ball
room, this time with the Mag
netics, a band from the Balti
more/Washington area.
Part of the softer rock genre, 
the Magnetics* show of covers  
and originals covers a bit more 
ground than most cover bands. 
With a strong base of new 
wave and reggae tunes by 
Talking Heads and UB40, 
among others, along with some 
of the more conventional cover 
tunes by the Doors and Rolling 
Stones, the Magnetics also 
include original tunes that are 
reminiscent of Pittsburghs own 
Affordable Floors. Our music 
revolves around high energy, 
sophisticated rock and roll, 
says Lex OBrian, who plays 
drums, keyboards, and vibra
phone for the band. Along with 
A.J. Eckert, who doubles on 
drums and keyboards as well 
as guitar, Jim Barbaro on gui
tar and vocals, and Ray Schmarder on bass, the Magnetics 
produce classic top forty music.

Throughout the end of Septem
ber and into October, four special 
art exhibits will continue in the 
Oakland/Pittsburgh area. They' 
include an exhibition of 10 awardwinning artists, photography 
exhibits, and the woodcut prints 
and wire-hanger sculptures of 
CMU alumni.
The Pittsburgh Society of Art
ists is sponsoring the works of 
Hugh Watkins, a degree-holder 
in Design and Fine Arts from 
CMU, featuring two dozen of his 
woodcut prints. Under Professor 
Bruce Carter, he studied the art 
of woodcut printmaking and has 
distinguished himself by an 
emphasis on process as well as 
image. The blocks for many of his 
prints were carved into miscella
neous furniture such as tables 
and ironing boards, making the 
shape of the board an integral 
part of the final work. The im
agery presented in these wood
block prints is culled from my 
travels at home as well as travels 
into my imagination. The show 
will run until Oct. 8 at the South 
Side Birmingham Loft, 24 S. 18th 
St., W-Sa., 10AM-4PM.

Fantastic Planet / Light 
Years
Yuk! Theyre humanlike! They just 
keep multiplying. Squish them! In the 
animated Fantastic Planet, big blue 
people and little humanlike people exist 
in disharmony. The big blue people, the 
Draggs, occasionally enslave the little 
humanlike people, the Oms, and keep 
them as pets. Eventually the Oms fight 
back - watch and see. The Oms, being 
humanlike, get violent. This is not a 
film for the kiddies.
Also showing is Issac Asimovs 
Lightyears, a 1987 animated feature 
that dropped out of sight very quickly.
Supposedly it was very good but not well 
publicized  should be an interesting 
double feature.

Hairspray 
John Waters most recent film, and the 
final film for his biggest (and I mean that) 
star, the late lamented transvestite actor 
Divine. Hairspray is set in Baltimore in 
the late 50s, where an American Band
stand-like showis under the gun for forbid
ding black dancers in the studio. Trashy, 
kitschy and magnificent vintage Waters, 
the film also sports co-stars Debbie Harry 
and Pia Zadora. Listen for the great period
soundtrack.

The Terminator
Ill be back, he said in an accented

Arnold Schwarzenegger is The Termi
nator, a part man, part machine killer. 
With the aid of an arsenal of semi-auto
matic weapons and a vocabulary of a six 
year old, the Terminator sets 
out to kill. Hes got Linda Ha
milton set for termination and 
only Michael Biehn can help her. 
This is the final film in the AB 
Schwarzenegger series and 
probably his best.

a space alien who comes to earth, moves 
into a house in Beverly Hills, and collects 
blood to send back to his home planet. Un
fortunately, they cast Traci as a human

carries a silver briefcase with him everywhere he goes, to give him

dont check out. Meanwhile, Johnson is luring hookers down to his

Tolerance and acceptance are two totally different things. Im not going to debate 
about whether gays are tolerated at CMU, but Ill certainly say they arent ac
cepted.
Senior Applied Math/Computer Science major Michael Portuesi worries about 
grades and wears blue jeans. Hes got too much homework and too little time. In 
short, hes a normal CMU student in every aspect. But hes also a member of CMUs 
Gay and Lesbian Alliance and a homosexual.
Portuesis complaint is that toleration implies that there is something to be 
tolerated. Acceptance, on the other hand, implies an understanding of an 
individuals differences without judgement. Being accepted, it seems, is one of the 
more important issues in the life of a gay or lesbian: accepted by parents, accepted 
by friends, and, most importantly, accepted by oneself.
GALA, said Portuesi, provides an accepting family atmosphere. According to 
data submitted each year to Student Senate, part of GALAs purpose is to provide a 
social outlet for the CMU gay and lesbian community. Currently, GALA members 
enjoy parties, dancing, ice skating, and skiing in addition to speakers, films, and dis
cussions aimed at helping members come to terms with themselves and their part in 
society.
It takes a really long time to accept that youre gay or lesbian, said Portuesi. 
Getting to know other gay people makes it a lot easier to accept yourself.
Another of GALAs purposes is to educate the CMU community on gay-related
ys Aycuhedh hSStu
issues such as AIDS, coming out, roommates, and homophobia, a goal Portuesi 
admitted the group has not had success with.
Last year, GALA advertised Blue Jeans Day, in hopes that Carnegie Mellon 
students would wear blue jeans to support gay rights. Predictably, the event brought 
out more controversy than blue jeans. Charges of trickery and fears that wearing 
blue jeans equated with homosexuality tainted the event.
We made a big mistake with Blue Jean Day by not telling the campus what our 
objectives were, said Portuesi, who stated that GALA hoped to bring about an 
awareness of gay students and gay rights on campus.
GALA was also in the news last semester when attendees at a GALA-sponsored 
dance had to be evacuated from the Skibo ballroom after an anonymous bomb threat 
was received by Campus Police. The threat turned out to be unfounded, and the 100- 
plus attendees returned to the ballroom.
"Our next dance is going to be called the Duck and Cover dance, laughed Por
tuesi. Strangely, the bomb threat turned into a blessing in disguise for the group; 
news coverage and campus sentiment was generally favorable to GALA. In addition 
to the publicity mileage, the group made a profit on the dance.
GALA has had little trouble obtaining funding from Student Senate, perhaps in 
part because one student senator is a GALA member. Still, claimed Portuesi, the 
group feels it has to justify expenditures more than other organizations. And at least 
one member of Senates Funding and Recognition Committee voted against the last 
GALA allocation solely because of his personal-anti-gay sentiments.
One of GALAs recent successes has been the addition of sexual orientation to 
Carnegie Mellons policy of anti-discrimination. However, the 1988-90 Course 
Catalog carries the old version of the policy.
The administration is generally cooperative, but sometimes they tend to forget we 
exist, claimed Portuesi. GALA was omitted from the 1988 Word and the current 
Beyond Academics, an admissions office publication sent to prospective freshmen.
In both cases, GALA members have been assured that the omissions will be cor
rected in future revisions.
Weve learned some lessons about how to deal with publicity, said Portuesi. The 
way you present yourself really affects the way people accept you.
Politics aside, being a gay or lesbian is a difficult situation for anyone to confront. 
Coming out and saying that youre gay to someone for the very first time is a very 
traumatic experience, said Portuesi.
Portuesi separates the coming out process into several steps. In the first step, an 
individual realizes that he or she is gay. Portuesi emphasized that this is not a 
conscious choice: Being gay is an attribute. As far as Im concerned, my being gay is 
like my hair is brown.
An individual must come to accept his homosexuality, and then tell close friends 
and family members. Responses vary from total acceptance to outright rejection.
Parents especially have trouble coping with a sons or daughters homosexuality. 
Parents have to learn to accept it, said Portuesi. Coming out is not a totally 
Positive experience. The New York-based Parents and Friends of Lesbians and 
Gays (PFLAG) provides support for those close to someone who has just come out.
After coming out to friends and family, Portuesi said that most gays get to know 
and socialize with other gays. It is here that GALA can help; Portuesi told a close 
friend he was gay at the end of his freshman year but didnt go to his first GALA 
meeting until early in his junior year. I wish I had gone sooner, he stated.
The final step to coming out is publicly acknowledging ones sexual orientation.
Not every gay has to be publicly out, but you should get to accept yourself and be 
happy with yourself, advised Portuesi.
With the exception of a few outbursts of homophobia, Portuesi feels that CMU is 
not a bad place for gays. The issues he does take exception to are implicit, subtle, 
and often unnoticed.
He cites as an example the way people insult each other by calling each other 
faggots or gays. Said Portuesi: Gays are acceptable to bash on. You can call 
somebody a faggot but not a nigger.

Gay? Bisexual? Think
ing about it? Last year 
that caption caught the eye 
of many students on the 
Carnegie Mellon campus.
Although the majority of 
those students were not 
gay or bisexual, the statemen-t, which was postered 
in almost every dormitory and class
room, certainly left students thinking 
about it  homosexuality and the 
gay population on campus.
How many students really know 
someone who is gay? In reality, CMU 
boasts a fairly large gay population, 
yet most students, when asked, 
claimed that they really havent met 
anyone who was homosexual or bi
sexual.
In last years official report to Stu
dent Senate for approved funding, 
the Gay and Lesbian Alliance at CMU 
claimed 70 activities-fee-paying 
members. Furthermore, GALA mem
ber Michael Portuesi estimated that 
at least one hundred to two hundred 
students at Carnegie Mellon were 
either homosexual or bisexual, and 
could benefit from GALA.
Is that really an accurate estimate, 
and if so where is that sector of the 
population hiding? Why does homo
sexuality seem to be so isolated from 
the rest of CMUs student body?
The answer seems to lie partially in 
the fact that homosexuals and hetero
sexuals perceive themselves very dif
ferently from each other, and if truth 
be known both seem to segregate 
themselves from the other. The segre
gation is probably not intentional and
I want to be democratic and say 
that everyone is entitled to his or her 
own preference, but I still dont un
derstand how that preference could 
be a member of the same sex."
a CMU sophomore
doesnt really stem from prejudice as 
much as it results from comfort. Homo
sexuals seem to feel more comfortable 
with people who accept their sexual 
preference, and heterosexuals seem 
to feel more relaxed with people who 
dont threaten their own.
Homosexuality simply makes many 
heterosexuals uncomfortable. It usu
ally generates some type of defensive
ness, anxiety, or confusion. The ma
jority of heterosexuals simply dont 
know how to deal with it because they 
are so far removed from it.
One sophomore, when asked how 
she felt about homosexuals in gen
eral, and in particular about the gay 
population at CMU, replied, Well, I 
dont know. I mean, whenever I hear 
the word homosexuality I become 
nervous. I really dont know whether 
to defend it or be abhorred by it. I 
guess I dont know what I feel about 
it. I want to be democratic and say 
that everyone is entitled to his or her 
own preference, but I still dont under
stand how that preference could be a 
member of the same sex.
When asked about their attitudes 
towards gays, many students either 
responded harshly or flippantly us
ing such terms as fags and queers. 
One male student actually said that
last year he and a friend 
walked through Grey 
Matter about ten times 
on Condom Day simply 
to see who was sitting at 
the GALA table. How 
many other students have 
done similar things, such 
as scope out a GALA 
dance, or stare blatantly 
at the GALA booth at the 
activities fair?
It seems that only a few students on 
this campus really understand homo
sexuality and because this lack of 
understanding exists among students 
of opposite sexual orientation, many 
students simply try to ignore the fact 
that a notable sector of our campus 
population is gay.
The general attitude toward gays 
was summed up by a junior. Im not 
really sure what I feel about homo
sexuality in general, but I guess any
one is entitled to have a club that 
supports their interests. I dont really 
feel threatened by it, I simply dont 
know that much about it.
The attitude toward gays doesnt 
seem to be one of resentment, merely 
one of confusion. Not one single stu
dent seriously thought gays should be 
discriminated against. However, 
many did not realize that the gay 
population at CMU was so large.
As sophomore Elisa Sickman stated, 
It is wrong for those of us who are not 
involved to criticize or to condemn its 
existence. Most students seem to feel 
that everyones own sexual orienta
tion is something very private, and 
although they may not agree with or 
understand the preferences of others, 
it is a decision that everyone must 
make for himself or herself.

Lazarus position responds to a 
variety of needs 
identified by and 
through the uni
versity commu
nity. I want to 
help find the holes 
Hand gaps in the 
j [university] sys
tem and try to fill 
^them, Lazarus 
tsaid.
k Many of these 
j gaps were brought 
to light following 
the recent Quality 
 of Life Task Force report. This 
report was compiled to try to find 
. how to improve life at Carnegie 
'' Mellon. Thats exactly where I fit
ter academic advising, for not only 
current students, but also for 
those who take a leave of absence, 
by choice or default, and offering 
students some re
sources to turn to. 
Other projects include 
promoting fellowships 
and time management 
programs, and seeking 
a balance between aca
demics and other parts 
of the college experi
ence. We realize that 
academics are rigorous 
on this campus. We 
want to promote extra
curricular activities, 
leadership, and a cer
tain social atmos
phere, Lazarus said.
A lifetime is too 
short to accomplish all 
your goals, Lazarus 
pointed out. She is 
trying to implement 
programs and projects 
that look at areas not 
previously stressed, 
such as fellowships. 
There are dozens of 
fellowships available to 
students, and there are 
many capable students 
on this campus who 
might receive them. 
But many do not know 
about them.
Another idea she is working on 
is an online resource book of fac

visible on campus. Along with the 
resource book are plans to get 
more students involved in faculty 
research programs.
When asked about her percep
tions of faculty student interac
tion, Lazarus said, We have far 
more people who care about the 
total academic environment, es
pecially about faculty student 
interaction, than who do not care. 
It is a matter of breaking down 
some misconceptions everyone 
has about each other. Thats just 
another of my jobs.
Lazarus will work closely with 
the Deans Council, a committee 
of Associate/Assistant Deans and 
student groups, to help determine 
more of these holes in the sys
tem and try to rectify them. She 
stresses that her projects are 
cooperative efforts. Lazarus 
wants anyone with gripes, com
ments, suggestions, -or anyone 
who just wants to talk about life 
at Carnegie Mellon to make ar
rangements to meet with her. I 
need to hear from especially stu
dents. Theyre the conscience of 
this campus.
Elliott and Jordan said that 
Lazarus appointment reflects
both their and the Presidents 
commitment to improving the 
quality of life for students by 
insuring that they have access to 
a complete range of academic 
services of the highest quality.
Lazarus has had much experi
ence in academic administration. 
She was the Associate Dean of the 
Graduate School of Industrial Ad
ministration, and Associate Dean 
of the School of Urban and Public 
Affairs. Prior to coming to Carne
gie Mellon, Lazarus was Associ
ate Dean at Wellesley College. 
She has had broad responsibili
ties in the areas of academic and 
career advising, educational pro
grams, student services, public 
relations, and development.
Lazarus completed her under
graduate work in Anthropology 
at Brown University in 1967. She 
received a masters from the Uni
versity of Connecticut in 1969 in 
Anthropology, and completed her 
doctorate in Educational Anthro
pology in 1973 at the University 
of Massachusetts. Lazarus serves 
as Co-Director, together with the 
Secretary of Education of the 
Philippines, of the Asian Womens 
Institutes Commission on Women 
and Work. Her research interests 
include the changing work roles 
of women in Asia, and the chang
ing roles of men and women in the 
family.
Lazarus is the author of two 
monographs and numerous ar
ticles based on this work. Dr. 
Lazarus will continue as an Ad
junct Associate Professor of Edu
cational Anthropology in SUPA.
Eating problems explored
Of all the struggles young 
people face today, among the 
(most perplexing are eating 
disorders. Anorexia and bu
limia are both seen more and 
more in teens and the young 
adult population. People of all
Lfr t/fe>^r/A/<sf=>s\r?T 7
ages, races, and classes can 
suffer from the disorder. And 
with increasing public aware
ness, more people are coming 
forward to ask for help.
Anorexia is a serious lifethreatening disorder of delib
erate self-starvation, with wide 
ranging physical and emo
tional components. The indi
vidual is preoccupied with 
dieting and the image of a slen
der body. Frequently there is a 
distortion in body image and 
despite major weight loss, the 
person continues to regard 
him/herself as overweight
The following symptoms are 
associated with anorexia: 20- 
25% body weight loss, lack of 
menstrual period, denial of 
hunger, leaving for the bath
room after meals, frequent 
weighing oneself, frequent uses 
of laxatives, and feelings of 
worthlessness. These signs do 
not all show up with every case. 
Individuals differ widely.
Bulimia, the more common 
of the two, involves recurrent
episodes of binge eating, fol
lowed by excessive exercise, 
self-induced vomiting, or purgingby the constant use of laxa
tives or diuretics. This disease 
is usually associated with 
people in their early twenties 
and older.
The following red flags are 
associated with bulimia: strict 
dieting followed by binges, 
frequent overeating (especially 
when distressed), expressing 
shame or guilt about eating, 
and disappearing after meals.
As with anorexia, a person 
who is bulimic may not display 
all the symptoms at any one 
time. They are both diseases 
which seriously erode a 
persons health, sometimes ir
revocably, and sometimes can 
cause a persons death.
A first step towards diagno
sis is to examine ones attitude 
and behavior around food. If 
you have questions about your 
eating or someone elses, you 
should ask for confidential, 
competent consultation. Both 
the Health and Counseling 
Centers on campus will give 
you that needed attention.
An event to note: on Septem
ber 29, a symposium on Medi
cal, Psychological, and Per
sonal Aspects of Anorexia and 
Bulimia will be held in WeH 
7500 from 6:30 pm to 8:30 pm.

Ah, late August, time to escape 
the prolonged boredom of the 
summer job and get back to the 
prolonged boredom of classes. I 
knew I was almost back to Pitts
burgh when on the last leg of the 
pA turnpike it started raining. I
was home, the land where An
drew Carnegie gave everyone 
money, except the guy who pays 
my tuition. Upon arriving the 
Hose-ing office helped celebrate 
my return by locking me out of my 
apartment. I thought it was damn 
nice of them, but they found the 
correct key before I finished fill
ing out the withdrawal form. 
Maintenance tried to make up for 
the mistake two days later by 
removing all the mirrors from the 
apartment. Now I cant shave, 
but thats OK, I know where they 
live.
Still, it was good to be back in 
the action, or back in The Shit 
as Joker put it in Full Metal 
Jacket, and don my exalted (and, 
by the end of the week, exhumed) 
Counselor T-shirt. Orientation is 
a time for adjustment for the fresh
men, long speeches by the ad
ministration, and free food for the 
counselors.
For a week we did 
our best to confuse and 
mislead the freshmen 
as much as possible.
Dont worry, you can 
have a social life and a 
QPA at the same time!
Youll never see Dick 
Cyert once while you are here, 
but that doesnt prove his nonex
istence. I eat at Kiltie all the 
time! One of the funniest hap
penings had to be the LCB ex
plaining to the freshmen how they 
would lose their drivers licenses 
if caught drinking, to prevent 
drunken driving, despite the fact 
that none of them have cars.
However, soon classes started 
and as I painfully chiseled my 
Counselor Steve shirt from my 
torso I spotted the first one of 
THEM. THEY were back. The 
roving gypsies of campus fame. 
Yes, The Hanky Heads had re
turned.
Living in Pittsburgh, the Land 
of the 15 minute weather cycle, 
teaches most people the value of 
umbrellas and head gear. Hats 
can keep the rain off your head 
and the sun from your eyes. Ive 
even seen hats that hold two beers 
for you to keep your hands free for 
other activities, like volleyball, 
feeling your girlfriend, or holding 
two more beers. Never before have 
I seen so many handkerchiefs on 
heads about. I hadnt realized the 
Aunt Jemima look was in.
I think this bears some exami
nation. Id have to admit that Aunt 
Jemima was the only woman who 
could make breakfast taste good 
no matter what Mom did to it. She 
even made zucchini pancakes 
edible. Maybe not.

Oddly enough, quite a few of 
these new-wave party animals are 
fraternity brothers. Perhaps beerbonging reminds them of the days 
when they used to drink the syrup 
from the bottle. Actually, I think 
theyve stopped washing their hair 
in protest of CMU holdings in 
South Africa. Maybe they all have 
bad haircuts.
I asked a friend of mine, who, by 
the way, is not a brother at a 
fraternity, why he wears a hand
kerchief on his head. Usually 
because I cant be bothered to 
wash my hair. I do wash it, but 
when its wet, you know.
Hey, we all have days like that. 
Some of us even have weeks and 
months. My friend went on to add 
that he wasnt going to force his 
radical hanky lifestyle on any
one. The decision to wear or not 
to wear hankies should be a per
sonal one. I agree.
I asked SAP (Students Against 
Paisley) president Mik Mikshinitski what he though about head 
hanky usage: Hey, fine with me, 
as long as they dont have those 
stupid little designs on them. If 
we could just introduce the con
cept of color to the art majors!
Later that day the Dean of 
H&SS announced that the school 
was now recommending Tartan 
Plaid handkerchiefs for purchase 
by all H&SS students. It has 
come time to integrate CMU into
a full-scale hankie 
campus. No student 
will be barred from 
owning their own 
hankie. I have asked 
Financial Aid to find 
 a way to include handkerchiefs into every 
students financial aid package. 
He went on to speculate about the 
possibility of including laundry 
tokens with every five hankies.
When I asked the Dean how he 
planned to integrate hankies into 
a campus-wide network, he re
plied, Dont worry, Ill think of a 
way. If I can convince Dr. Hayes 
and Rousha to wear one, the rest 
of the campus will just fall in 
step.
Elma Thumbskins of the 
Oakland/Shadyside Daily Fash
ion Gazette had this to say about 
the recent craze: Hankies are a 
cheap and elegant accessory for 
any college wardrobe. Theyre 
very versatile, too. You can wear 
the same hanky to DU, the Os, 
and to your physics final in the 
morning! Also, in emergencies it 
can be used to blow your nose.
Junior Army ROTC squad 
leader John Blackie Blackhead 
showed Armys new camo hand
kerchief to me. It really works 
well. We ROTC cadets wear these 
on our heads at all times so Soviet 
spy satellites cant take pictures 
of us!
Yes, and think of all the money 
the military can make by selling 
them in Army-Navy stores! Ive 
already bought several to conceal 
picnic food from ants.
I dont know. I think this hand
kerchief business is really getting 
out of hand.

In the Jewish religion, the 
Ten Day s of Atonement start on 
Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish 
New Year, and end on Yom 
Kippur, the Day of Repentance. 
Rosh Hashanah is a joyful occa
sion.
To celebrate, Jews are not sup
posed to do any work, but rather 
are supposed to enjoy the start 
of the new year. The Jewish 
calendar began with what Jews 
believe to be the creation of the 
world; this year is the Jewish 
year 5749.
On Yom Kippur, Jews are to
take this time to repent for all of 
their sins of the year. Jews are 
supposed to ask for forgiveness 
from anyone they have sinned 
against, as well as ask for Gods 
forgiveness. Since total concen
tration is to be given to repen
tance, Jews are not allowed to 
work, enjoy themselves, or even 
eat or drink. The fast starts at 
sunset the night before Yom 
Kippur, and continues until the 
sun sets the next day.
This year Yom Kippur falls 
on September 21. Services will 
be held at the William Pitt 
Union at 8:00 pm on September 
20, and in Skibo rooms 105-106 
at 10:00 on September 21.
Fans make noise

The scene was the CMU foot
ball game against University of 
Chicago. It was an absolute 
nuthouse. The rabid CMU crowd 
was a throbbing mass of turbu
lent emotion, impassioned and 
fanatical, willing to do just about 
anything to get its team to win. 
Well, not exactly. But it did blow 
a few kazoos.
The spirit at the Saturday, Sep
tember 16, game seemed better 
than at some previous games, 
partly due to the. efforts of the 
Enthusiasm Committee. The 
committee is working to promote 
school spirit for all major activi
ties, in addition to football. Ev
eryone is welcome to join.
At Saturdays game, the theme
was Proud to be Loud. As people 
walked into the stands, they were 
handed free horns, whistles, and 
kazoos.
Erica Levy, a junior who co
chairs the committee, stated, Im 
not sure if there is an improve
ment in spirit, but I think that the 
people who are coming are hav
ing more fun. The noisemakers 
went over really well.
Most people we talked to en
joyed the noisemakers. Freshman 
Cheerleader Colleen Geary said, 
People are becoming more in
volved, but we need more people 
to come to the games.
Although Alumni Dave Zazac, 
H&SS 81, enjoyed the neat fa
vors, he stated, I would have 
joined the band.

Whoever said CMU doesnt know how 
to party couldnt have been around dur
ing the first month of the fall semester. 
Although our campus has been under 
pressure from the LCB and the Pitts
burgh fire marshal, students are still 
determined to keep a vibrant Greek 
System alive.
This past weekend was the kick-off for 
fraternity rush. On Saturday night most 
of the campus fraternities had their 
annual theme parties, from Pi Kappa 
Alphas Island of Pikia to Delta Tau 
Deltas Heaven and Hell, followed by 
the Watermelon Bash on Sunday. Both 
events have been annual traditions of 
the CMU Greek system for several dec
ades.
For freshmen experiencing Greek life 
for the first time, these parties were not 
just a taste of CMUs social life. The 
structures each house built gave rushees 
a chance to see the time and dedication 
that goes into the brotherhood, whereas 
upperclassmen were inevitably reminded 
of the laborious and rewarding work the 
fraternities put into booth during Carni
val every spring.
In reference to their annual Heaven 
and Hell party, Steve Black, Delta Tau 
Deltas Social Chairman, said, Its not 
as much a rush event as it is an effort to 
show freshmen how impressive our house 
can be as a group. Its reminiscent of 
Carnival  a fall booth.
Most of the fraternities have been 
carrying on their theme parties for at 
least twenty years. However, several 
houses have just began themes which 
could be the start of a new tradition. One 
such example was Sigma Nus South of 
the Border party, which marked the 
beginning of an annual party theme for 
their house. According to their Presi
dent, Grant Hauber, It was just time, 
the house was motivated - its our coming 
out. However, due to the impending 
threat of the fire marshal, Sigma Nu 
decided to limit its decorating to avoid 
direct fire hazards and to fireproof flam
mable decorations.
Theta Xi, like Sigma Nu, had their 
first theme party this year. Theta Xis 
big theme party has always been at 
Halloween, but Friday night they held 
their first Remember the Alamo party, 
which may also become an annual tradi
tion.
Pika, DTD, SAE and DU have some of 
the oldest theme parties around that 
date back at least 20 or 30 years. Pikas
Island of Pikia party goes back to at 
least the 1950s, according to Social 
Chairman Christopher Paul. The house 
is annually decorated like the tropical 
island of Pikia, a real island probably 
somewhere in the South Pacific.
Every year the brothers of Pika build a 
waterfall with a bridge and a pond in 
their basement. However, because offire 
codes, Pika was forced to keep its struc
ture outside of the house. Like most of 
the houses, Pika must spray fireproofing 
chemicals over all flammable materials 
that they decorate with. But the brothIts not as much a 
rush event as it is an 
effort to show freshmen 
how impressive our 
house can be as a 
group."
Steve Black, DTD
Wf Ia
m wSUK
ers didnt let restrictions stand in the 
way of a good time, especially the broth
ers who were dressed in full body paint 
carrying spears.
Along a similar theme was Delta 
Upsilons Jungle Party, which is over 
20 years old, according to DU Social 
Chairman Pat Garrett. The houses water 
slide is at least 10 years old. Every year
several engineers in the house design 
the three story slide, which must also be 
fireproofed. For safety reasons, three 
brothers are stationed at different points 
of the slide, and only one person can go 
down at a time. However, anyone at DU 
could see this didnt slow down progress
 almost everyone was soaked and no 
one seemed too unhappy about it.
Sigma Alpha Epsilons Dantes In
ferno has been a tradition for at least 21 
years. A large part of this tradition has 
been the two story volcano that in the 
past exploded every year at the end of 
the night. However, after shattering 
windows at Pika and Morewood Gar
dens, the house was asked to stop having 
its theme party. Five years went by with
out Dantes Inferno, and then SAE 
resumed their annual tradition  at 
least with the exception of some dyna
mite.
Delta Tau Deltas Heaven and Hell 
party was the product of another Delt 
miracle, according to Black. Two days 
before and nothing is done, and three 
hours before and the paint is just drying! 
Like booth, its very intense and its a 
great feeling when its done. The first
floor was decorated as Heaven, the porch 
as Purgatory, and the basement as Hell.
The express from Purgatory to Hell is 
a 12 foot slide, which in the past led 
directly to the basement. However, be
cause of fire codes, the slide deposited 
partiers right outside the door to Hell. 
Other changes included fireproofing deco
rations in the basement and controlling 
crowds with dance floors in both Heaven 
and Hell.
Phi Kappa Theta had its beach party, 
after holding the fence for two weeks to 
advertise it. Decorations included sand, 
a waterfall, palm trees, coconuts and a 
record breaking number of partiers for 
the house.
Reminiscent of more warm weather, 
Alpha Tau Omega held its annual Ft. 
Lauderdale party. Traditionally this 
event features a wet t-shirt contest. This 
year it also included a hired security 
guard to control guests. Nevertheless, 
ATO had no problems filling its base
ment for the contest.
Needless to say, this past weekend 
was far from unexciting, and complaints 
about CMUs social life should be few 
and far between.
More sophomores pledge sororities this year
By RACHEL GARB
Tartan Staffwriter
If you were anywhere in the vicinity 
of Margaret Morrison Plaza or Frater
nity Quad last Saturday night, chances 
are you heard or saw a mob of girls 
cheering and howling energetically in 
unison.
These girls have reason to be so joy
ous. They recently went through a 
hectic and stressful ordeal: Sorority 
Rush 88.
It all began on the night of Thurs
day, September 8, when approximately 
ninety-five girls formed in groups of 
five to ten and were guided by an 
appointed Rush counselor through the 
five sorority houses oncampus: Chi 
Omega, Delta Delta Delta, Kappa 
Alpha Theta, Delta Gamma, and 
Kappa Kappa Gamma. The rushees 
stayed at each house for exactly twentyfive minutes ; enough time to get a 
small idea of the sororitys traditions 
and to meet a few sisters.
The next night, Friday, the girls
again went to visit all the houses, this 
time for thirty-five minutes. Houses had 
themes ranging from Casino Night to 
The Olympics to Skid Row. The food was 
fitting to the theme, and the sisters and 
rushees got more familiar with one an
other over appetizers.
All the while, the sisters and rushees 
had to keep in mind that they had deci
sions to make: the rushees about which 
houses to keep visiting, and the sisters 
about which girls they wanted to invite 
back.
Saturday afternoon, the parties con
tinued. The girls had received their invi
tations that morning and could only 
accept three of them. The parties were 
only forty-five minutes long, not much 
time for many rushees to narrow down to 
two sororities or for sisters to decide to 
whom the extremely important final 
party invitations would be given.
The final parties were held on Sunday 
afternoon, lasting an hour each. They 
are very special and sentimental and, for 
me, made all the difference, said one 
new pledge.
I really didnt think I 
was the sorority type. 
Andrea Boyer
After attending the party or parties, 
rushees then ranked the houses they 
visited. Meanwhile, the sisters of the 
houses completed their final bid lists. 
This information was passed on to 
Panhel, the association that regulates 
sorority rushes nationwide, which deter
mined where the bids went.
Each house can only extend fifteen 
bids per year. Therefore, sorority rush is 
competitive. In order to be confident and 
make a good impression, many girls wait 
until their sophomore year to go through 
rush, after they know more people and 
what to expect.
As a freshman I didnt think I had 
enough time and wasnt sure if I was 
ready to make the commitment,b said 
Sophomore Pledge Kelly Walsh.
Sophomore Susan Moll added, I en
joyed going through rush much more 
this year than I did as a freshman. I felt 
a lot more comfortable.
A major change in Sorority Rush this 
year was the decrease in time from 
about two weeks to only four days, a 
change which brought mixed reactions. 
One sister felt that she got to know the 
rushees better when rush is concen
trated into the four days. Another sis
ter, however, thought that A four-day 
rush is too short and extremely ex
hausting for both rushees and sisters.
Whatever the length, sorority rush is 
quite an experience. I really didnt 
think I was the sorority type, said 
sophomore pledge Andrea Boyer. I just 
wanted to meet people. But I was very 
lucky to find a group of girls that I 
really feel great about. But I never 
would have known if I hadnt rushed. I 
encourage anyone to at least go through 
rush.
Sophomore pledge Anne Heinle 
summed it all up. I had a good time 
and the food wasnt bad either.

This is the third and final ar
ticle in our series exploring com
puter literacy at Carnegie Mellon.
Sophomore Steve Peters is aTartan Staffwriter. Ed.
Computer is Carnegie 
Mellons middle name. Students 
in every major are required to 
take at least two computer classes: 
Computer Skills Workshop, and
Computer
Literacy
third of a series 
\______________________/
a computer language class. Clus
ters are in almost every building 
on campus; CMU has developed 
its own distributed computing 
system; Personal computers can 
be purchased at a significant 
educational discount at the com
puter store; and the Dean of H&SS 
is now recommending Macintosh 
IIs for all entering H&SS fresh
men. In short, its a varied digital 
world here at CMU. Somewhere 
amongst all these wires and 
monitors are the students the 
people who are supposed to bene
fit from all the technology.
The previous two articles of this 
series dealt with the 
administrations view of computer 
literacy. This article is all about 
what students have to say about
computer literacy, and the com
puters they use at Carnegie Mel
lon.
Being able to get around on 
any computer with very little 
knowledge of that computer, or 
knowing how to get help if you 
need it is how Computer Con
sultant and Senior BioChem 
Major Monice Buckner defined 
computer literacy.
Buckners thoughts were ech
oed by Jon Hurshman, a sopho
more history and modern lan
guages major. [Computer liter
acy is about] having an idea what 
to do. Dont panic.
Everyone seems to agree that 
being computer-literate entails 
knowing how computers work in 
general so that you can apply that 
knowledge in specific situations.
For the uninitiated, the road to 
computer literacy starts with 
Computer Skills Workshop. While 
some students say that CSW is 
helpful to start out with, fresh
man CS major Lance Wyatt com
mented, CSW is a pain in the 
butt. Luckily CSW is not the only 
way to learn. Many freshmen 
learn to operate Andrew from 
watching upperclassmen.
According to Hurshman, Prac
tice is the key. Many hours of 
exploring the system certainly 
gives the user experience, but as 
Sophomore History and Creative 
Writing major Marci Vail put it, 
The desire to learn is necessary.
Not only do Carnegie Mellon 
students know how to use the 
Universitys digital demigods, but
most of them like the computer 
systems as well. Andrews good, 
although its under construction, 
and the Macs are really easy to 
use, commented Lisa Stanziale, 
senior IS major. Users like the 
multitude of clusters and the latenight hours they hold.
Academic Computing also sup
plies the latest in hardware and 
software. Macs take the cake for 
word processing and graphics, but 
Andrew workstations are the only 
machines that will run much of 
the software required for classes. 
The electronic mail system is also 
very popular.
Its easier to do papers on the 
Mac. I do physics and Minitab on 
Andrew, said Stephen Tomko, 
adding, People rip on Andrew, 
but you can do a lot.
The biggest complaint about the 
computer systems is the number 
of machines. Its really wonderful 
that everyone is supposed to use 
the computers, but during the 
busy times of the year, it can be a 
real hassle to find one. Space on 
Andrew workstations is especially 
hard to procure. Of'course, the 
eternal complaint about Andrew 
is the speed. Andrew is hard to 
get on and slow, commented one 
Andrew user.
Macintoshes seemed to be the 
most popular machines on cam
pus. Many people prefer the 
powerful Mac IIs to the older 
machines, causing shortages 
during peak times. Paul Westfall, 
a senior theater major, suggested 
that the university replace the
older laser printers on the net
work with new ones so the new 
fonts can be used. He also wished 
the used Macs that were replaced 
by Mac IIs were put up for sale to 
students.
Few students had anything good 
to say about the IBM PCs. While 
some students still use and prefer 
these old machines, they tend to 
be the ones who were familiar 
with PCs before arriving at CMU. 
Recent graduates of CSW rarely 
touch the PC if they can possibly 
avoid it.
Many students disagree witji 
the new H&SS recommendation 
that students purchase Mac IIs. 
Stanziale thought that recom
mending computers was Stupid 
and unnecessary.
Dave Supp, a junior IS major, 
thought that the decision was 
ridiculous. A Mac II is more power 
than necessary for an H&SS stu
dent. He added that they might 
be more appropriate for CIT or 
MCS. One student even suggested 
that this was a plan to keep the 
school from having to add more 
machines and clusters. The gen
eral consensus showed that stu
dents would rather wait until 
graduation to buy a computer.
Through four years at CMU, 
students get a lot of computer 
exposure. Even H&SS and CFA 
majors acquire some type of com
puter literacy. Perhaps the com
puter systems currently at Car
negie Mellon are not perfect, but 
students have good things to say 
about them anyway.
Proud to be Loud

asm for the game. They cer
tainly provided the most excite
ment with their raucous cheerleading and can-can perform
ance down the sideline.
Cynthia Lee, senior member 
of the band, said, I think the 
noisemakers are great because 
before it seemed like the only 
ones cheering were the band. 
Senior Band President Joel 
Douglas stated, I think the 
school spirit is lacking and 
anything we could do to get 
people out here is great. 
Offering an alternative view 
was junior Donna Spicuzza. I
dont think handing out noise
makers made that much differ
ence. The team is doing well 
enough to get people here.
Overall, the noisemakers 
provided a good time. Heck, even 
the officials looked enthusiastic
 we could see it on their faces 
that they wanted to change their 
whistles for our fringed horns.
Future ideas on the table for 
the enthusiasm committee to 
promote spirit include a barbe
cue before the game, face-paint 
decorating for the Halloween 
game, and a raffle, involving a 
limo to and from the game, fol
lowed by dinner.

Is it an egg or is it a plant? 
Tell it to make up its mind and 
come back later.
George Carlin
This confused, purple vege
table is actually very useful, as 
confused vegetables go. Its good 
for side dishes or main dishes, 
its healthy, and, most impor
tantly, its cheap. The only big 
problem you may have with 
eating eggplant regularly is 
wisecracking friends who will 
see you eating it and start quot
ing George Carlin at you.
A ripe eggplant is firm and 
slightly soft, but not so soft that 
it easily yields to a poking fin
ger. It should have no blem
ishes. Smaller ones will have 
fewer seeds than larger ones 
and are, therefore, less likely to 
be bitter. The skin is edible but 
a bit tough, so most people re
move the skin before cooking it.
You can peel it all at once before 
slicing, but I find it easier to slice 
it first and then cut the skin away 
from the slices.
Eggplant Parmesan 
Slice the eggplant width-wise 
in quarter-inch-thick slices. Dip 
the slices in beaten egg, then in a
mixture of bread crumbs and 
Italian spices (oregano, garlic, 
rosemary, basil, thyme). Sautee 
until the breading is lightly 
browned. Lay the slices in a bak
ing dish and top with tomato sauce 
and grated mozzarella cheese.
Bake at 350 until the cheese is 
melted.
Broiled Vegetables 
Slice the eggplant either widthwise or length-wise (it doesnt 
really matter) in half-inch slices. 
Place on a lightly oiled broiler 
pan with tomato, mushroom, and 
zucchini slices. Spread the vege
table slices out so that they do not 
overlap (arrange them in pretty 
patterns, if it makes you happy), 
sprinkle them with olive oil, basil 
and black pepper, and broil them 
for five to ten minutes.
If desired, top with slices of 
mozzarella and return to the hot 
oven (it will still be hot from the 
broiling, so it doesnt need to ac
tually be on) until the cheese is 
bubbling.
Eggplant Rice Bake 
Cook two cups rice in five cups 
of water. Put the rice in a casse
role dish and mix with green 
pepper, mushroom, onion, and
cheese slices. Cut an eggplant 
in half lengthwise (dont peel it) 
and scoop out the seeds. Add 
them to the rice mixture. Place 
the eggplant halves on top of 
the dish so that they cover the 
whole mixture (if they dont 
cover your casserole dish, put 
aluminum foil over them to seal 
it better) and bake at 350 for 25 
minutes. Slice the eggplant 
halves and serve with the rice 
mixture.
Eggplant Sautee 
Peel an eggplant and cut it 
into one-inch cubes. Sautee it 
in a large saucepan with olive 
oil, diced onions, minced garlic, 
and two bay leaves until the 
bay leaves are wilted. Add two 
cups of chicken broth. When 
the broth comes to a simmer, 
add a cup of rice. Cover tightly 
and cook until the rice has 
absorbed the broth (about half 
an hour), stirring occasionally.

iv I look forward to the Olympic 
| Games the way most people 
look forward to Christmas or 
their birthdays. This is not out 
of a sense of nostalgia  I was 
[ never a track star or a gymnast 
or out of a sense of patrioti ism. I would love to see the 
United States athletes win 
[ every medal, but only if they 
preserve it.
If people ever lost sight of 
L what the Olympics are all 
 about, the people of Seoul and 
the Olympic Organizing Com
mittee, hopefully, reminded 
them in the Opening Ceremoj nies last Friday.
! It was a beautiful show,
* which the ceremonies are 
supposed to be. However, it was 
a lot more than simply flashy 
| costumes and choreography. It 
showed the world (South) 
j Korean custom and traditions.
: In contrast, the Los Angeles 
games of 84 were flashy and, no 
I offense to Southern CaliforI nians, just plain Hollywood.
| The games of 84 were stilted, 
and the Opening Ceremonies il
lustrated this well. Instead of 
demonstrating American diveri sity and lifestyle, they were deI voted to Hollywood and the Sil
ver Screen. It was a beautiful 
show, but I was quite embar
rassed. Is the movie industry 
the crowning jewel of the 
American crown? I certainly 
hope not.
Another thing about the 84 
games - they spoiled Americans. 
I do not want to take anything 
away from Carl Lewis or Mary 
.ou Retton, but I do not think 
;hey would have finished as 
well as they did if the Russians 
or East Germans had competed.
The boycott by the Eastern 
Block robbed our athletes of the 
challenge of competing against 
the greatest athletes in the 
world. The Americans beat 
some of the worlds better 
athletes, but they did not beat 
the best.
American fans had better be 
prepared to see their athletes 
win a fraction of the gold 
nedals (silver and bronze also) 
-hey did in Los Angeles.
But who cares? Watching the 
)est in the world compete 
against each other for a once in 
| a lifetime moment in the sun is 
| what fans enjoy. So what if we 
f only win a few track medals, or 
if we do not dominate in gym| nasties as we did in 84? As long 
as the athletes try and dont get 
hurt, we should be proud. 
However, this idea was 
lissed while I was watching 
-be Womens 10 meter platform 
I diving competition on Saturday, 
f heard a group of guys next 
oor cheering while they 
jWatched the same competition, 
his did not surprise me until I 
leard them cheer louder when a 
Chinese diver, who would have 
'eaten an American out of a 
edal, smacked the water on 
er final dive. This lowered her 
lcore and allowed the Ameri!ans to take a silver and bronze.
Those fans were not appre
ciative of the Americans earna medal. They were moved 
>y the fact that the Chinese 
[diver choked.
This type of attitude only 
erves to demean the Olympic 
deal and tradition. Save the 
'aised fists and the America 
les cheers for Rambo movies, 
ot the Olympic Games. What 
ould Jesse Owens think?

Saturdays matchup between 
University Athletic Association 
rivals CMU and the University of 
Chicago was the first time these 
two teams with long football his
tories met. The Tartans (3-0, 2-0 
UAA) continued their winning tra
dition with a 20-6 win over the 
Maroons (0-2, 0-2).
The CMU defense rose to the 
occasion in the second half to hold 
back Chicago after the Tartans 
lost their second quarterback in 
three weeks to injury. Freshman 
quarterback Steve Paterno sat out 
the second half after suffering a 
shoulder injury. The freshman 
from North Allegheny High School 
passed for two touchdowns and 
was seven of eight for 128 yards. 
The extent of Patemos injuries 
were unknown at press time.
The Tartan defense insured that 
Patemos loss would be mini
mized. Carnegie Mellon allowed 
only two second-half first downs, 
shutting the Maroons down to 
only 68 yards of offense in the 
final thirty minutes. Tartan De
fensive Coordinator Terry Bodnar 
summed up the teams perform
ance saying, In the second half, 
we did a great job.
The defense has shone in all 
three CMU games. Opponents are 
averaging less than 13 first downs, 
240 yards, and 12 points per game.
While the defense played a stel
lar game, the special team unit 
broke Chicagos back early in the 
fourth quarter. With the Tartans 
leading 14-6 and the ball on the 
Maroon 27, Carnegie Mellon lined 
up for a field goal. Instead of kick
ing, holder Mike Beresford took 
the ball, rolled right and found 
running back Chris Hansen open 
on the sideline. Hansen took the 
ball 20 yards for the score to raise
the lead to 20-6.
Tartan Head Coach Rich Lackner hadnt planned on calling the 
fake. CMU had originally lined 
up for the field goal as the third 
quarter ended. As Lackner ex
plained, The wind was now 
against us and [Special Teams] 
Coach Koren talked it over with 
me and we decided to go for the 
fake.
Beresford, who is normally on 
the receiving end of a touchdown 
pass and not the throwing end, 
admitted, Id rather catch them.
Hansen did more than catch 
passes. The senior fullback ran 
for 109 yards, earning WRCT 
Player of the Game honors. Two 
consecutive Hansen runs of 21 
and 15 yards set up the final score.
While the second half was 
dominated by defensive play, the 
first half was controlled by the 
offenses. The Maroons got the first 
chance and drove the ball all the 
way down to the Carnegie Mellon 
19. Their drive stalled on fourth 
and nine when Ray Crothers 
sacked Chicago QB Scott Gross.
The Tartans took over and 
immediately went to Hansen who 
responded for twenty yards. 
Quarterback Paterno soon fol
lowed with a scramble right for 
nineteen yards, sprung after a 
key block from junior guard Russ 
Hahn. Two plays later, Paterno 
found Halfback Scott Bamyak 
near the thirty-yard line. Bam
yak took the ball the rest of the 
way for the touchdown, and CMU 
led 7-0. The pass was Paternos 
second game-opening touchdown 
in two weeks.
The Maroons turned around 
and mounted a drive of their own. 
Chicago Quarterback scrambled 
and passed the Maroons down 
the field. Chicago capped the drive 
with a one-yard run by Steve 
Chudik. The snap on the extra
point was botched and the Tar
tans led 7-6.
Carnegie Mellon added to its 
lead later in the second quarter. A 
33-yard strike to Barnyak set the 
Tartans up at the 19. Six plays 
later, Paterno found Barnyak 
alone in the end zone for their 
second touchdown collaboration 
of the half.
Next Week: The Tartans travel 
to B ethany, West Virginia for their 
Presidents Athletic Conference 
opener versus the Bisons of Be
thany College. Bethany lost its 
opener at Capital and played 
Duquesne Saturday. In last 
seasons meeting at Tech Field,

the Tartans rolled over the Bi
sons, 48-14. Carnegie Mellon rang 
up 440 total yards, including 335 
on the ground.
Bethany is smarting over the 
loss of quarterback Tracey 
Finchum who is forgoing his final 
year of eligibility.
Saturdays kick-off will be at 
2:00 pm. WRCT (88.3-FM) will 
begin its broadcasting at 1:50 pm.

Carnegie Mellons boys of summer are back. The baseball elub 
kicked off its 1988 season last 
Wednesday and Thursday, split
ting a two-game series with La 
Roche.
On Wednesday, the Tartans hit 
the road and got hit hard. La 
Roche proved to be a rude host, 
crushing Tartan pitchers for fif
teen runs during the contest while 
Carnegie Mellon managed to score 
just once.
La Roches pitchers rostered 8 
strikeouts and held the Tartans 
to just 3 hits on the afternoon. 
The Tartans only left 3 runners 
on base in the game.
The La Roche fielders proved to 
to be a formidable defense. They 
made no errors and even turned a 
double play to end the first in
ning.
On a perfect day for baseball, 
with 79 degree weather and sunny 
skies on Thursday, the Tartans 
returned to their home field at 
Mellon Park. It was now Carne
gie Mellons turn to play host.
They were able to avenge their 
loss by defeating La Roche, 9-7.
One of the keys to Carnegie 
Mellons victory was centerfielder 
Warren Flax. Flax delivered a 
bases-loaded double, scoring all 
three runners which helped as
sure the win.
[Flaxs] presence was very 
important in Thursdays win, 
said Club President and first 
baseman Perry Pierce, i^es 
helped the club with several key 
hits and has shown a high degree 
of consistency in center field. 
The Tartans mustered 5 runs
on two hits in the second inning, 
including the contribution made 
by Flax.
In total, the Tartans came up 
with seven hits and had only one 
error. Even though the team left 
seven runners stranded on base, 
La Roche helped out by commit
ting seven errors.
Tartan pitcher Rick France 
recorded five strikeouts on the 
way to his first win of the season.
Other Tartans worthy of com
ment were infielders Mike Gess 
and Mike Petrich.'Both players 
have excelled in both hitting and
fielding.
Petrich and Gess are real 
plusses to the club, said Pierce. 
They are both terrific hitters and 
they combine to form a tough 
middle infield. They work really 
well together, and they should 
help us win a lot of ballgames in 
the future.
The Tartans were scheduled to 
play Penn State McKeesport at 
Mellon Park on Sunday, but bad 
weather cancelled that game. The 
team will play tonight at Steu
benville University beginning at 
6:30 pm.

The Mens Cross Country team raced its way through thick 
mud and tough competition at the Indiana University of 
Pennsylvanias annual Invitational meet.
As usual, Dave Supp led the team, placing sixth overall with 
a time of 26:45. Pat Noll followed closely behind and finished 
in 12th place with a time of 27:04. Gary Meeker trudged 
through the mud in to finish in 32nd place and rounded out the 
top three for Carnegie Mellon at 27:44.
The IUP Invitational was the teams first exposure to tough 
competition this season. They will travel to Slippery Rock Uni
versity next week to face more grueling opponents in that 
schools invitational meet.
These kind of meets are good for the runners, says Coach 
Meckley. It prepares them for the PAC meet, Regionals and 
ultimately, Nationals.
But the National Championships are far from most of the 
runners minds at this point. With four meets left, including the 
University Athletic Association Championships, Meckley is re
ally gearing up for the Presidential Athletic Conference meet to 
be held here on October 29th. A win at the PAC meet would give 
Meckley nine straight Championship victories.
Although most of the Tartans did not run their best race 
at IUP, Meckley has faith that his runners can pull out the 
valuable PAC win. Just as long as they stay healthy, well be 
all right, says Meckley of his team.
With the superb talents of Carnegie Mellons young run
ners still to peak this year, they should provide many more wins 
for Coach Meckley.

The Carnegie Mellon womens 
tennis team officially opened their 
Presidents Athletic Conference 
season with a win Saturday, de
feating Hiram College, 7-2. This 
followed a disappointing 1-8 loss 
against Indiana University of 
Pennsylvania on Thursday.
The #1 doubles team of Suzy 
Dotter and Beth Cavanaugh 
played aggressively, taking their 
opponents to 3 sets before losing 
6-0,6-7,5-7.
Coach Julie Babler acknowl
edged the ability of IUP, a Divi
sion II team, They were pretty 
aggressive. They outplayed us by 
coming to the net a lot. Hopefully 
well do a lot better when we play 
them in the Spring.
The teams win against Hiram 
Saturday reflects a promising 
season for the team. #1 singles 
player Suzy Dotter won 6-0, 6-2 
and #2 Beth Cavanaugh also won, 
6-2,6-3. The only disappointment 
came when #3 Mary Beth Ashbaugh lost a close match 6-7 (3-7 
tie breaker), 6-4, 4-6. This was 
offset by #4 Alice Garber who won 
6-4,6-1; #5 Sohee Chung who won 
6-1, 6-4; and #6 Gina Murphy 
Townesend who rounded out the 
match with a 6-2, 7-5 win.
The doubles teams were just as 
successful in their matches. #1
Were really ex
cited about this 
season. Hopefully, 
this will get the 
[team'a] momen
tum goingB"
Alice Garber
Suzy Dotter & Beth Cavanaugh 
won 6-3, 6-4, while #2 Mary Beth 
Ashbaugh & Alice Garber lost 6- 
7,2-6. However, a 6-1,6-1 victory 
for freshman Jenny Bourque and 
her partner Sohee Chung, helped
finish up the day on an up note.
Coach Babler was especially 
excited for Bourque, Shes got a 
lot of potential and will be a real 
asset to us in the coming years, 
hopefully in singles as well.
The exhibition matches were 
also successful for the Lady Tar
tans as they won two and lost two. 
#7 Maya Steinburg won 6-0, 6-1; 
#8 Colleen Sims lost 4-6, 4-6; #9 
Ellen Koh won 6-0,6-0 and #10 
YiRen Wang lost 4-6, 2-6.
When asked about the reasons 
between Thursdays loss and 
Saturdays win, Coach Babler 
commented, [Saturday] we tried 
a lot of new things we had been 
practicing on: getting to the net, 
serving and volleying, especially 
with doubles.
Carnegie Mellons Alice Garber 
sees this victory as a great booster 
for the team. Thats the strong
est weve ever seen Hiram, said 
Garber. We were really happy 
we could beat them. Were really 
excited about this season. Hope
fully, this will get the momentum 
going!

Football preview: look for Buffalo in 
the East and Seattle in the West
By DAVE BRILL
Tartan Staffwriter 
The second in a series preview
ing this years NFL. This week, 
the American Football Conference 
(AFC) Eastern and Western DiviAFC East
Buffalo Bills: After a surpris
ing 88-89 season, the Bills are 
this years dominant team in the 
AF C Eastern Division. Quarter
back Jim Kelly leads an offense 
that is a formi
dable threat.
However, the 
Bills main 
threat lies in 
their defense.
With the acqui
sition of Cor
nelius Bennett 
and Shane Conlon, the Bills 
pass rush is the 
best in the AFC.
Anchored by de
fensive end 
Bruce Smith, 
the Bills rush 
makes up for 
their only weak
ness, the secon
dary. This is the 
one place where 
Buffalo is vulnerable.
If Jim Kelly can.stay healthy 
and the team plays at least .500 
in divisional games, the Bills 
should win the division.
Indianapolis Colts: Last 
years division champs are formi
dable due to running back Eric 
Dickerson. The big question for 
the Colts this season is who will 
start at quarterback. Gary Hogeboom is injury prone and Jack 
Trudeau is not a starting QB.
Last year, the Colts were 6th in 
total defense and third against 
the pass. A good pass rush covers 
up the Colts weakness in the sec
ondary.
Indianapolis will finish second 
because their passing game is not 
strong enough to carry them to 
the championship spot. Due to 
their tough schedule, they will 
find themselves challenged in 
many difficult games with strong 
opponents.
Miami Dolphins: Led by quar
terback Dan Marino and sup
ported by Mark Clayton and Mark 
Duper, the Dolphins will always 
put points on the board. With the 
emergence of running back Troy 
Stratford, Miami has a genuine 
running attack. However, the loss 
of All-Pro center Dwight Stephen
son, will hurt the offensive line.
The main problem as usual for 
the Dolphins is defense. Even with 
All-Pro John Offerdahl, the Dol
phins were ranked 26th in total 
defense. With the lack of a pass 
rush, the Dolphins secondary will 
give up a lot of yards and points.
If the Dolphins can develop an 
effective running ame, their of
fense will be tough to stop. Unless 
the Dolphins find a pass rush and 
have a strong divisional record, 
they will finish fifth.
New York Jets: On offense, 
quarterback Ken O Brien and 
wide receivers A1 Toon and Wesley 
Walker are almost as formidable 
as Miami. Toon was the leading 
receiver in the AFC last year with 
68 catches. Tight end Mickey 
Shuler is also a quality receiver.
Running backs Johnny Hector, up the big plays.

Tartan Staffwriter
Our name be mud, was the 
popular quote for the mens 
team, but the Womens Cross 
Country team voiced the same 
cry at the Indiana University 
of Pennsylvanias Invitational 
meet.
The women slipped through 
the mud and among some of 
the toughest competition they 
will face all year.
Junior Sue Johnson led the 
muddy marauders and fin
ished 44th overall with a time 
of 21:00. Sophomore Kristin 
Burgard was a close 50th, fol
lowed by senior Rosanna 
Neupauer, Lois Raska and 
senior Francesca Crannel who 
finished out the top five.
The women ran good indi
vidual races but, as a team, 
this was not their strongest 
performance. In this meet, the 
Lady Tartans faced runners 
from schools the likes of Pitt, 
the U.S. Naval Academy, Ithica College and other tough 
division I and II schools.
Coach Donatelli reassured 
his runners that this is one of 
the toughest meets all year. 
Like Coach Gary Meckley of 
the Mens Cross Country team, 
Donatelli is confident that the 
Carnegie Mellon women will 
have a good showing at the 
Presidents Athletic Confer
ence Championships.
In dual meet competition, the 
Lady Tartans are undefeated 
this season after their trium
phant victories over Grove City 
and Duquesne back on September 10th.
With rugged determination 
and staunch spirits, the women 
can make Coach Donatelli 
proud at the PAC Champion
ships on October 29th, to be 
held here in Schenley Park.
This Saturday, Carnegie 
Mellon will travel to Slippery 
Rock University of Pennsylva
nia for the Slippery Rock Invi
tational.
On WRCTs Sportsline last 
Thursday, members of the 
team commented that Coach 
Donatellis support has been 
instrumental in their success.
effectively. But loss of Ken Sims 
last year, a major force on de
fense, will diminish the pass rush 
by double teaming on Tippet.
Another trouble spot will de
velop if Grogan gets injured. The 
Patriot backups are untested. 
They should finish third.
AFC West
Seattle Seahawks: After 
making the playoffs last year as a 
wild card, the Seahawks will fi
nally make it to the playoffs as 
the Division Champoins.
Even with the loss of Fredd 
Young in a trade with the Indian
apolis Colts, Jacob Green and 
Brian Bosworth spearhead a very 
strong defense. Seattle also has a 
strong secondary led by cornerbacks Patrick Hunter and Terry 
Taylor.
Curt Warners ability to stay 
healthy is the only gray area on 
what should be a very bright 
season. Warner is injury prone 
but if he remains healthy, he could 
be a strong asset for Seattle on 
their way to the playoffs.
The Seahawks are strong and 
should win the division if they 
can play consistently.
Denver Broncos: The blow
out loser of Super Bowl XXII, 
Denver, is still a tough team.
Quarterback John Elway is the 
most dangerous quarterback in 
the AFC. A strong offensive line 
and a super core of receivers make 
the Broncs tough to defend 
against. The acquisition of Tony 
Dorsett gives the Broncos a qual
ity running back.
Defensively, led by All-Pro Karl 
Mecklenburg, the Broncos pos
sess a strong pass rush. The sec
ondary is good but tends to give
the Chiefs should not get blown 
out in many games this year. The 
defensive line was unable to gen
erate a pass rush and gave up 
many yards to opposing running 
backs.
On offense, the only real bright 
spot was wide receiver Carlos 
Carson, who had over 1,000 yards 
receiving last year. There are no 
promising signs for the Chiefs and, 
if it was not for San Diego, they 
would finish last.
San Diego Chargers: The loss 
of quarterback Dan Fouts will 
hurt, especially when one consid
ers the replacement  Steeler 
reject Mark Malone.
On offense, Lionel James and 
Tim Spencer will have to improve 
a running attack that was last in 
the AFC last year. The Chargers 
need a strong quarterback and 
some help on the offensive line. 
Their defense is weak as well.
The Chargers will finish last 
and hope for a good 89 draft to 
improve their team.

Last Thursday, the Majors IM 
Football season opened. The 
teams that make up this league 
are: ATO, Beta, Pika, SUPA and 
Crunch Bunch. Pika had this week 
iff.
The first of the two games played 
was between the two football frats, 
ATO and Beta. The rivalry was 
jlearly strongbetween these two 
teams, with the players hit
ting hard even though it 
was touch football. About 
twenty-five spectators 
showed up to watch the teams 
clash.
The first half opened with ATO 
receiving. They quickly turned 
their drive into seven points. Beta 
eplied with seven points of their 
own on their first possession.
The second quarter started with 
an ATO score. However, due to an 
unsuccessful extra point attempt, 
the drive was only good for six 
points.
The quarter continued with 
both teams scoring one TD after 
another. By halftime, ATO led 
,I,.B
The second half opened with an 
early touchdown by Beta. ATO 
tried to score on their first drive, 
but they were unable to convert 
on a fourth down. On the punt, 
Beta fumbled the reception.
The Beta player who fumbled 
recovered the ball and attempted
to run it out of the end zone. ATO 
downed him in the end zone, 
thereby gaining a safety.
Beta kicked off, and the third 
quarter closed with ATO ahead 
29-28.
The fourth quarter commenced 
with ATO scoring on their first 
drive. There was a dispute be
tween the teams on
the
score, and one
of the Beta players re
ceived a personal foul for his abu
sive language directed at the refe
ree.
ATO kicked off and Beta started 
near the five yard line. Two plays 
later, the Beta quarterback was 
sacked in the end zone for an
other ATO safety.
ATO received the ball and at
tempted another drive. However, 
they could not convert on fourth 
down, so Beta regained posses
sion.
With ATO up 38-28 and ap
proximately five minutes left in 
the game, Beta started throwing 
Hail Marys into the end zone.

sive back left an injured Beta 
player on the field. Dan Crimmins had to be taken away in an 
ambulance. He suffered a partial 
tear in the ligaments in the side of 
his right knee. He is on crutches 
now, and will go back to see the 
doctor in a few weeks.
After a half hour delay, play 
resumed. Beta went back to their 
drive, but were unable to score.
ATO won the game, 38-28.
The defending champions, 
Crunch Bunch, showed why 
they were last years 
champs in their game 
against SUPA.
Crunch Bunch elected to re
ceive the opening kickoff and in 
five plays had six points on the 
the board.
On the second play of SUPAs 
drive, Crunch Bunch intercepted 
a pass and ran it in for a touch
down. By halftime, SUPA still 
had not achieved a first down and 
they were still unable to stop the 
Crunch Bunch offense. Crunch 
Bunch held a 27-0 lead after the 
first two quarters.
SUPA received the ball to start 
the second half. They were still 
unable to gain any yardage, and 
Crunch Bunch scored again.
On their second drive, SUPA 
got a first down due to a pass 
interference penalty against 
Crunch Bunch. The referee had 
to eject a player from each team 
because of a heated argument that 
erupted over a hard hit.
The second half continued with 
the Crunch Bunch blowing out 
SUPA. The game concluded with 
Crunch Bunch winning by a score 
of 59 to 0.
Crunch Bunch had six inter
ceptions, three of which were good 
for touch downs. SUPAs quarter* back managed to complete one 
pass out of twenty attempts.
Next weeks games will be 
played on Thursday,begining with 
Beta playing SUPA at 4:30 and 
Pika playing ATO at 5:30.
