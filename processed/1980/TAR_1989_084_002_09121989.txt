Space Allocation Board closes cluster
Academic Computing says decision was made without its input
By JAMES B. ENDRES
Tartan News Editor
The administration has decided 
to close one of Academic Comput
ing's eight computer clusters in a 
move which CIT officials cite as a 
space trade-off between the Elec
trical and Computer Engineering 
Department and International 
Education.
But the move has drawn an 
outcry from Academic Comput
ing officials, who say they were 
not consulted before the decision 
was made.
Unless Academic Computings 
planned appeal is successful, 
Hamerschlag Hall room 20 will 
soon become the property ofECE. 
Although previous decisions by 
Carnegie Mellons Space Alloca
tion Board have gone into effect 
immediately, Academic Comput
ing officials say they have not 
been told when they should va
cate the room.
According to Jean Dexheimer, 
director of Academic Computing, 
and William Arms, vice president 
for academic services, Academic 
Computing was not consulted in 
the decision. But CIT Dean Paul 
Christiano contends that Aca
demic Computing was in on the 
decision-making process at every 
step.
Arms and Dexheimer both told 
The Tartan that they were upset 
about the method of the decision, 
claiming that Academic Comput
ing was not consulted in the SAB 
deliberations. Said Arms, First 
of all, I dislike the process. I was
Its probably the least used of all the 
clusters. It's in such a rotten place; 
it's almost impossible to find.
 VP for Academic Services 
William Arms
upset about the way it happened. 
I dont feel so badly about the 
decision itself. I wish theyd had a 
chance to gather some data to 
look at it carefully rather than 
just to do it on short notice. I 
heard about the request a few 
days before and put in a quick 
memo. I was out of town so I 
couldnt go to the meeting.
We had no real data to deter
mine the extent to which that 
room is lightly used or heavily 
used, Christiano explained. 
Nevertheless, the proposal was 
acted on. Since that time Bill has 
told me that he will talk to the 
President to see if the decision 
can be postponed until its dis
cussed again, maybe in light of
additional data. But Bill had that 
chance. When he wrote the memo 
that responded to mine, he didnt 
include any data about the usage. 
So I dont know where hes com
ing from.
As of Friday, Academic Com
puting was putting together the 
clusters usage data from end-ofshift reports that student cluster 
consultants are required to pro
duce.
Regarding the general short
age of computing facilities in re
lation to student demand, 
Dexheimer said, Space is a criti
cal factor. Thats true for the 
University as a whole. 
According to Arms, the decision 
resulted from the expansion of

Freshman Gabriel Grilll enjoys his living room In Centre Plaza Apartments. CMU hopes to buy the building.NwS !o pur tuAulIou4 icil!me2!4
By MICHAEL J. EWEDOSH
Tartan Assistant News Editor
Carnegie Mellon has leased nine
teen apartments in the yet-unfmished Centre Plaza Apartments 
building. The University expects to 
acquire the building.
Currently, 57 freshmen are liv
ing in the apartments, mostofwhich 
are spacious two-bedroom, threeoccupant apartments that Director 
of Housing Anthony Martin said 
were probably originally intended 
to be purchased as condominiums.
Gabriel Grilli, an H&SS fresh
man living in Centre Plaza, said 
that this is where Im going to live 
for four years.
Residents of the building who are 
living in three-occupant, two-bedroom 
units are being charged at the hous
ing rate for two-bedroom, three occu
pant apartments which is $3,010 per 
year. A minority of students are living 
in three-bedroom, three-occupant 
apartments and, since no rate cate
gory exists for such a unit, those resi
dents are being charged at the rate for 
a two-bedroom, two-occupant apart
ment, which is $3,310.
Martin said that the freshmen as
signed to the building were among 
the last freshmen to be assigned 
because the Housing Office wasnt sure 
how much space would be available 
for students this year in the building.
To live in the building, students are
required to sign a quietliving agree
ment. Martin said that although the 
agreement may not have been the 
type of accommodation that the stu
dents requested, theyll have to live 
by it. Its my concern that we insure 
that [students] do not disturb people 
who live in the building or the adja
cent building. Hopefully, the area 
coordinator living in the building, 
Teresa Campbell, will help to moni
tor the situation. She will make a 
difference in the short and long run 
 freshmen living there now have 
greater needs than other students, 
and her presence will prevent any 
negative impact on the other resi
dents of the building.

Committee 
passes 7.7% 
hike in tuition
By RANDY L. UDAVCAK
Tartan Staffwriter
In meetings held last spring, the CMU tuition com
mittee voted in favor of a 7.7 percent increase in tuition 
for the coming 1990-91 academic year, raising the total 
to $14,000 per year. The increase marks the third 
$1,000 increase in a row since the 1987-88 year.
Bill Elliott, vice president for enrollment and a co
chair of the committee along with Fred Rogers, said 
that the increase is due to the rising costs of maintain
ing the University, while providing what he referred 
to as incremental gains in some areas.
Elliott said, Obviously, theres some trade-off be
tween how much increased revenue we think we have 
to have in order to sustain and maintain the Univer
sity, and at the same time, how much we can afford to 
gain some extra revenue in order to do those extra 
things wed like to do in order to make the University 
a better place for all of us to be.
During the meetings, there was discussion about 
whether or not to include an extra amount  in 
addition to the tuition increase  in order to procure 
funding for the University Center.
There was a lot of debate about that, said Elliott. 
In fact, it was even brought up and first initiated by 
some of the students on the committee. But after lots 
of debate and discussion back and forth, it was deemed 
inappropriate to do. Elliott did not rule out the possi
bility of such action in the future, however. It may be 
an idea whose time has yet to come, he said.
The tuition committee was comprised of a diverse 
body of representatives, including five faculty mem
bers (Linda Argote, Richard Hayes, William Hughes, 
Edward Rubin, and Michael Salomone), five students 
(Robert OToole, Howdy Pierce, Andrew Robitshek, 
Patricia Sedley, and Aaron Young), seven parents 
(Donald and Roberta Boyer, Nancy Condron, John and 
Carol Hickey, and Martin and Rosemary ORorke), 
and five staff members (Walter Cathie, Patrick Keating, 
Harold Miller, Stephen Schillo, and former Dean of 
Student Affairs Braden Walter). Its pretty unusual

PAT proposes bus fare hikes, moves to eliminate student fares
By JONATHAN LEVY
Tartan Contributing Editor
In a change that would hit col
lege students especially hard, the 
Port Authority of Allegheny 
County has issued a proposal 
calling for an across-the-board 
increase in PAT bus fares effec
tive January 1.
Under the proposal, the price of 
a ride will increase from one dol
lar to $1.10 within a single zone. 
Most of Pittsburgh is in one zone, 
while the surrounding municipali
ties are divided into four other 
zones; prices of multi-ride tickets 
will be increased by similar 
amounts. Some of these tickets 
will be eliminated while others 
are added.
Among the changes being pro
posed are the elimination of UTickets and the implementation 
of Ten Trip Tickets for use within 
a single zone. Ten Trip Tickets
currently exist for trips of two or 
more zones.
U-Tickets are now available to 
undergraduate and graduate 
students at a price of $15 for 20 
rides. The Ten Trip Tickets, which 
PAT officials anticipate many 
students will use in the place of 
U-Tickets, would be sold for $10. 
The change would increase the 
per-ride price of bus travel by 
thirty-three percent for students. 
A student traveling on the bus 
twice a day on weekdays now 
spends about $225 per academic 
year on U-Tickets and would pay 
about $300 if he or she used Ten 
Trip Tickets.
Prices of discount tickets for 
other groups such as children, 
senior citizens, and the disabled 
are being changed only in cases 
where the price is half the normal 
adult fares. These prices would 
be raised to half of the new fares.
Debra Decourcy, the Port AuPevawelh Lowhaphaudro, Damlenne Fenlon, and Pannapa Herabat 
board a PAT bus. Students will be hit hard by proposed rate changes.
thoritys assistant manager of She said that changes other than 
media relations, said that the direct price increases, such as the 
proposed increases in bus fares elimination of U-Tickets and the 
the first in seven years  have addition of single zone Ten Trip 
been made necessary by decreases Tickets, were proposed in order to 
in federal funds for the Port Au- simplify the system, 
thorityoverthepastseveralyears. Decourcy said that in writing
the proposal, the Port Authority 
tried to give people a chance to 
avoid the fare increase [by buying 
multi-ride tickets] if at all pos
sible. While she conceded that 
students will now pay more to 
ride the bus, she said that if UTickets had been continued, their 
price would have risen along with 
other fares. She also noted that 
students can still save money by 
buyingTen Trip Tickets and other 
multi-ride tickets.
Reaction at Carnegie Mellon to 
the proposed fare changes has 
been minimal so far. Many regu
lar bus riders are apparently not 
aware of the proposed increases.
Marlon Vaughn, a freshman 
civil engineering major who com
mutes from East Pittsburgh, said 
the fare increase will not affect 
him much; he said he knew about 
the U-Tickets but had not been 
using them. His primary comcontinued on page 5

Black graduate students 
host orientation dinner
On Wednesday, the Black Graduate Student Organization 
hosted an orientation dinner in the Faculty Dining Room.
BGSO President Daphne Scott said that the purpose of the 
dinner was to allow black graduate students to meet with one 
another and to meet with resource people whom they might not 
have an opportunity to interact with on a daily basis.
The dinner was attended by about 80 people, including repre
sentatives of the administration and about ninety percent of the 
academic departments.
Associate Provost for Academic Projects Barbara Lazarus said 
that departments that have not yet been successful in recruiting 
black graduate students had an opportunity to meet with some 
students that could prove to be resources that might help them 
by spreading the word that Carnegie Mellon is very serious about 
minority recruitment.
Scott said that Lazarus and Acting Dean of Student Affairs 
Michael Murphy were very instrumental in planning the event.
Because the BGSO couldn't contact all of the black graduate 
students on campus due to a lack of records, those students who 
were not invited to the dinner or who would like information 
should call Scott at x5892.
Digital Art Exchange Group 
to sponsor global art event
The Digital Art Exchange Group (DAX) will participate in an 
interactive computer networking project entitled Aspects of 
GAIA, featuringthe collaboration of artists electronically linked, 
in a public event from September 13-16 on campus.
Part of the prestigious Arts Electrnica of Linz, Austria, the 
oldest electronic arts festival in the world, the event will begin at
9 am tomorrow and continue, round-the clock, through 9 pm 
Saturday in the foyer of the College of Fine Arts.
The public is invited to observe this visually exciting creative 
exchange, in which the artists of Carnegie Mellons DAX Group, 
directed by Bruce Breland, will join artist/theorist Roy Ascot 
(host), Peter Appleton and Robert Pepperell of Great Britain, and 
Mathius Fuchs of Vienna.
Aspects of GAIA involves the creation of art images, sounds 
and texts exchanged through interactive computer networks by 
artists, musicians, scientists and other creative individuals from 
a variety of cultures across the globe. The subject is the many 
aspects of Earth, or GAIA, as seen from spiritual, scientific, 
cultural, and mythological perspectives. Ascot calls it a digital 
path across the globe; a telematic network between Eskimos, 
Hopi and Aborigines, African and South American civilizations, 
as well as WeBtem artists, scholars and scientists.
Admission is free. For information call x5180.

WASHINGTON (DJ)  Presi
dent Bush ruled out a tax in
crease to pay for his proposed 
$7.9 billion effort to combat ille
gal drug use in the U.S., and said 
he was trying to arrange unspeci
fied multilateral support for Co
lombia.
At a White House meeting with 
crime reporters, Bush said that 
he was trying to arrange multi
lateral support by major indus
trialized nations for Colombia, 
which is waging a battle against 
drug traffickers based in that 
countiy.
Bush said that he had been in 
telephone contact with U.K Prime 
Minister Margaret Thatcher and 
West German Chancellor Helmut 
Kohl to arrange support from the 
G-7 group ofmajor industrialized 
nations to help Colombia.
Bush said the calls generated 
warm support from both Thatcher 
and Kohl, and tKat he looked for
ward to receiving a similar en
dorsement from French President 
Francois Mitterrand. He didnt 
reveal any details of what that 
support might include.
Bush reiterated hir stand that 
the U.S. would not send any of its 
own militaiy forces to Colombia 
unilaterally without a request 
from the Colombian government, 
which has repeatedly said it 
doesnt want U.S. troops. The
U.S. can not and should not im
pose an armed solution in a sover
eign country, Bush said.
Bush said the U.S. wont have 
to increase taxes to pay for the 
increased spending on anti-drag 
activities in the U.S. He repeated 
a statement by Drug Czar Wil
liam Bennett: I dont believe we 
have a drug problem because we 
dont pay enough taxes. =><
Bush noted that White House 
Budget Director Richard Darman 
had identified about $716 million 
in funds that could be cut from 
other programs to pay for his 
proposals, making further reve
nue increases unnecessary.
If I thought the only way for 
getting money for fighting drugs 
was by raising taxes, I would do 
it, said Bush. But it isnt neces
sary.
The statement comes aftet

plan as not going far enough. -

Information Centers installed around campus
By MICHAEL J. EWEDOSH
Tartan Assistant News Editor
_Camegie Mellon has installed 
fdtir new Information Centers in 
tKfe first phase of a project to cen
tralize the sources of information 
available to members of and visi
tors to the campus community.
rThe Information Centers, for
merly referred to as Information 
Kiosks, have been installed in 
fdiir locations: the first floor of 
Hunt Library, the first floor of 
Warner Hall, near the Skibo In
formation Desk, and in the Morewood Gardens lower lobby. In 
addition, a fifth Information 
Center will be placed in the visi
tors center that is planned for the 
fifgt floor of 5017 Forbes.
"The project was budgeted at 
$$0,000 for its first phase but has 
remained under budget to date. 
The project was also completed 
on schedule, in time for the begin
ning of the school year.
Each center allows the user to 
look at a campus map, a calendar 
of campus events, and to check a 
summary of campus news. In 
addition, a change that is planned 
for the future is the inclusion of 
Whos Who at CMU, a directory 
of faculty, staff, and students that
Vice President for Enrollment Bill 
Elliott and Vice President for University 
Relations Don Hale acted on a 
student's suggestion that a unified 
source of information was needed at 
several locations on campus. 
9 Director of Public Relations 
Kyle Fisher
is currently on-Mne in the Library 
Information System.
The centers are networked and 
connected to a control center 
that allows the system adminis
trator to instantly update the 
information on all of the centers.
The Information Centers hard
ware, software, and contents are 
administered by the Department 
of University Relations.
Director of Public Relations 
Kyle Fisher said that a goodnumber of people have used the sys
tem since it was implemented. 
She said that the first of the 
centers was installed on August 
30, and that in the week between
August 30 and September 7, an 
automatic program surveying the 
number of users of the centers 
recorded 891 uses.
Each information center con
sists of an Apple Macintosh SE/
30 computer housed in a carrel. 
Each Macintosh is protected by a 
Minitronics security system.
Kwang Liew, a former graphic 
designer for the University, and 
Physical Plant were both involved 
with the design of the carrels.
Fisher said that the project 
came out of discussions of the 
quality of life at Carnegie Mellon. 
Vice President for Enrollment 
Bill Elliott and Vice President for
University Relations Don Hale 
acted on a students suggestion 
that a unified source of informa
tion was needed at several loca
tions on campus.
Brian Harrison, who is now a 
full-time programmer at the 
University, and Mark Lubinsky, 
a senior electrical engineering and 
biomedical engineering double 
major, were instrumental to the 
design of the centers software. 
We couldnt have done it techni
cally without the extra hours that 
they put in, Fisher said.
The software uses the Apple 
HyperCard application in addi
tion to hardware and software 
that enabled the programmers to 
implement the user-friendly 
touch-screen format.
HyperCard was helpful be
cause it is very visually oriented, 
helping users because people are 
very visually oriented, says Lu
binsky.
The information center project 
was proposed in January 1988. In 
May of that year the project re
ceived funding, and the prototype 
was installed in Hunt Library last 
November.
At that point, Fisher ex
plained, Mark put the finishing 
touches on the software.

;in past years, the tradition has 
been for soon-to-be Carnegie Mel
lon graduates to focus on one of 
two choices: graduate school or a 
very good job. This year, however, 
selected students will have the 
option of a chance at the Watson 
Fellowship.
The Watson Fellowship, which 
originated in 1968, is the main 
scholarship of the Thomas J. 
Watson Foundation. Watson was 
the- founder of IBM. Approxi
mately 75 students are chosen 
each year from prestigious col
leges and universities for inde
pendent study abroad.
This year, after negotiation with 
the Foundation from the fall of 
1:9.87, Carnegie Mellon became the 
55th school eligible to nominate 
candidates for the Fellowship. The 
Fellowship is a very prestigious 
honor for Carnegie Mellon.
Unlike more formalized plans 
of study laid out in other scholar
ships like the Fulbright Fellow
ship, the Watson Fellowship 
would allow the student to spend 
his or her wanderjahr accordingtohis or her own wishes, based
upon an individual project pro
posal. According to Dr. Joseph E. 
Devine, Associate Dean of H&SS, 
prospective candidates should be 
capable, energetic dreamers 
possessing an interesting juxta
position of characteristics. They 
should be accomplished and able 
to do disciplined, self-directed 
study. Past Watson Fellows have 
studied a diverse range of topics 
from youth employment programs 
in England and Sweden to crosscultural studies of gardens and 
landscapes in five different coun
tries.
Any H&SS senior or non-H&SS 
senior with an H&SS double ma
jor or minor is eligible for the 
competition. Preliminary appli
cations, consisting partly of two 
5-page essays, will be due to the 
H&SS Academic Advisory Cen
ter no later than Oct. 2.
This is Carnegie Mellons first 
year of participation in the pro
gram, and students in other 
schools in the Fellowship have at 
least had more time to consider 
their proposals to the Founda
tion. Nevertheless, Devine is quite 
optimistic about the future. We 
will have competitive students, 
but this will be our toughest year.

4The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  12 September 1989
NwS otIde ille4! 3Ile2e o2 dimcu4
By MICHAEL J. EWEDOSH
Tartan Assistant News Editor
Carnegie Mellon Campus Po
lice arrested SEI protestor Vin
cent Eirene at about 11:30 am 
Tuesday in front of Doherty Hall. 
City Court had issued a warrant 
for Eirenes arrest because he 
failed to appear at a hearing to 
face a charge of Defiant Trespass 
that was made on August 6.
Eirene had incurred the charge 
because of a protesthe had staged 
at the Software Engineering In
stitute to mark the anniversary 
of the atomic bombing of Hiro
shima.
Carnegie Mellon Police Chief 
James LaPaglia said that he was 
walking in front of Doherty Hall 
Tuesday when he noticed Eirene
sitting on a bench near the clock. 
I stopped and said to him, Vince, 
you didnt show up at your hear
ing the other day. His answer to 
me was I dont do hearings.  
LaPaglia said that he then 
asked Eirene to accompany him 
to the Campus Police station, but 
that Eirene refused. I told him 
that he was under arrest, and to 
wait here because I was going to 
send some officers over.
Three police officers arrived 
shortly and arrested Eirene, who 
had to be lifted up, handcuffed, 
and then dragged into the police 
car by the arresting officers.
LaPaglia said that Eirene will 
be held at the Allegheny County 
Jail for 30 to 90 days.
In a statement to The Tartan 
from Allegheny County Jail,
Eirene said that he would remain 
in jail until a hearing on Septem
ber 15, at which time he would 
either be released on time served 
or [be sentenced to] more time in 
jail.
Eirene said that we must 
struggle against this injustice 
against the best and brightest 
minds being used to prepare for 
the destruction of humanity and 
this waste of resources to this 
larceny to the poor and oppressed 
and the homeless. We must resist 
this madness with joy. He called 
it a privilege to be in jail with 
those who are forgotten and who 
speak out against the nuclear 
arms race, against Carnegie 
Mellon Universitys military re
search, and the Software Engi
neering Institute.
The tactics of Eirenes arrest 
had nothing to do with SEI, said 
LaPaglia. Its not good law en
forcement tomake an arrest when 
hes got a large group of people 
with him. LaPaglia explained 
that his department did not ac
tively attempt to arrest Eirene 
when the warrant was issued. 
We couldve given the warrant to 
a [Pennsylvania State] Constable 
who couldve arrested him at 
home. Or we couldve turned it 
over to Pittsburgh Police. 
LaPaglia said that if theres no 
urgent need for an arrest, were 
not going to allow him to set our 
departments response to him. We 
have a good relationship with 
Vince. We just want compliance 
with the reasonable regulations 
that exist on campus.

of the increase before making its

how the price would affect stu

well as how it would affect those 
students who are already here, 
said Argote.
According to the tuition com

examined a variety of issues,

Computer Science professor 
Dave OHallaron, who has been

YThe Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  12 September 1989
University to acquire Center Plaza Apartments for off-campus housing
continued from page 1
Martin said that the University 
is currently engaged in negotia
tions to purchase the building. 
Were working out the details. 
We want to make sure that the 
building is finished to our specifi
cations.
Martin also said that Dollar 
Bank, the current owner of the 
building, is seeking a variance to 
the zoning ordinance that would 
allow each apartment to house 
four occupants, rather than the 
present limit of three unrelated 
persons. Assigning four occu
pants to each unit would be a 
better choice for the housing sys
tem. Concerning the variance to 
the zoning ordinance, Martin said, 
I dont believe that the Univer
sity will pursue a variance [if 
Dollar Bank fails to get one].
Martin said that the building 
will be completed according to its 
original design. I do anticipate 
that a few changes might be 
needed, he added. Student needs 
differ from those of typical ten
ants. Martin mentioned electriThis is where Im going to live for 
four years.

cal wiring and computer network 
outlets as two possibilities.
Martin said that when the build
ing is fully occupied by students, 
he anticipates monitoring the 
entrance to the building with a 
twenty-four hour service desk like 
those in operation in Mudge 
House and Donner Hall.
Martin said that Centre Plaza 
Apartments would become the 
second off-campus apartment 
building owned by the Univer
sity, which already owfis Shirley 
Apartments.
With the spaces that the new 
residence hall and Centre Plaza 
apartments will open up, Martin 
says, I anticipate that for the 
first time in recent history, we 
will be able to offer University
housing to each undergraduate 
student who requests it. I also 
hope to be able to accommodate 
every freshman who desires hous
ing on-campus.
For next year, CMU plans to 
consolidate its off-campus hous
ing in the two buildings it hopes 
to own: Shirley Apartments and 
Centre Plaza. Units currently 
rented in other buildings will not 
remain as a part of the University 
Housing system.
Martin explainedthat currently 
several freshmen are forced to 
acceptspaces in off-campus apart
ments. I think Centre Plaza will 
be attractive enough to upper
classmen that they will select offcampus space, opening on-campus space for entering students.
Cnmem gi MnmloU vrsnmtU
Centre Plaza Apartments provide the most spacious living accomodations offered by University housing. 
CMU plans to buy the building and consolidate all of Its off-campus housing Into It and Shirley Apartments, 
which it already owns.

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  12 September 19897Hamerschlag cluster closing sparks controversy
continued from page 1
Educationin Smith Hall (formerly 
the Bureau of Mines Building B) 
into space previously occupied by 
ECE. ECE wanted to acquire 
space in Hamerschlag, Arms said, 
Dean Paul Christiano recom
mended to the Space Allocation 
Board that that cluster in Hamer
schlag 20 is not particularly heav
ily used. The Space Allocation 
Board met on Tuesday and agreed 
with that recommendation. 
Christiano denies making that 
suggestion. Somewhere alongthe 
line, someoneit wasntme, and 
I dont think it was ECE  sug
gested that we could trade space 
in Building B for HH20. This 
meant, unfortunately, that some
bodys ox got gored, and in this 
case it was the cluster.
Arms, Christiano, and 
Dexheimer have not heard an 
official changeover time. The 
usual case with Space Allocation 
Board decisions is that theyre 
immediate, said Dexheimer. I 
havent yet gotten anything offi
cial, but Im assuming itll be very 
soon.
Christiano doesnt regard the 
decision as meriting controversy. 
Ive talked with Bill Arms. Un
fortunately, Ive been put in a 
position where I was asked by the 
Planning Office to determine how 
much HH20 was used and to 
determine if ECE would accept 
HH20 rather than the Building B 
area. I think if anybody is goingto 
get upset about this its a shame 
because this particular issue is 
not the right one to focus on. 
Christiano said, I dont know 
whether this is just a turf issue 
that Bill Arms has decided to go 
to the wall for, or what. Its not 
really such a big deal to anybody 
in CIT.
Although naturally in some 
ways Paul Christiano and I sit on 
opposite sides ofthis, said Arms, 
I dont want to sound especially 
critical about the way Pauls gone 
about it. Ithinkthathesbehaved 
absolutely on the level.
Its easy for one to say Oh gosh, this is 
space being taken away from students,  
but I dont think Its nearly that simple. 
The real issue Is a matter of utility. I think 
Its generally accepted that HH20 has 
been under-utilized.

About Academic Computings 
role in the decision, Christiano 
said, I dont think anyone is in 
the dark. If someone wants to re
evaluate thedecision.thatsokay. 
Dexheimer agrees with Arms. 
Im sure I would have felt better 
about the decision if there had 
been some consultation, if we had 
had the opportunity to say what 
the need was.
I would have expected if not 
that I was consulted that at least 
the vice president for academic 
services, my boss [Arms], was 
consulted. I frankly dont know 
why we werent consulted. I dont 
assume that thats routine. Id 
like to think that its not routine. 
Dexheimer, Arms, and Chris
tiano all agree that HH20 is a 
fairly rarely-used cluster. Said 
Arms, Hamerschlag 20 is not the 
worlds greatest cluster space. Id 
like to trade that space for some
place more convenient. He con
tinued, Its probably the least 
used of all the clusters. Its in 
such a rotten place; its almost 
impossible to find.
Christiano explains the re-allo
cation in broader terms. Its easy 
for one to say Oh gosh, this is 
space being taken away from 
students, but I dont think its 
nearly that simple. First of all, 
the space that would be used in 
HH20 would be used for graduate 
students. Secondly, the space in 
Building B would be used to serve 
students. The real issue is a 
matter of utility. The general 
perception is that [HH20] is not 
used very much. The only stu

dents who seem to know that it 
exists are electrical engineering 
students. I think its generally 
accepted that HH20 has been 
under-utilized.
Dexheimer concurs. That clus
ter is not as heavily used as oth
ers on campus. Its in a relatively 
inaccessible place, and we hadnt 
put desirable equipment in there 
for that reason. The cluster was 
previously equipped with only 
IBM PCs. Academic Computing 
had recently replaced some of the 
PCs with Macintoshes and An
drew workstations.
According to Dexheimer, the 
equipment vacated from HH20 
will be available in other facili
ties. The machines will be used as 
replacements for machines in 
other clusters as they are needed. 
The Macintoshes and DecStations that we put in there will be 
available somewhere else. The 
total number of machines avail
able will go down by twenty.
Concludes Christiano: I dont 
think its a really big problem. Its 
done, to the best of my knowl
edge, with everybody understand
ing where everyone else is coming 
from. Ive taken great pains to tell 
Bill that. There havent been any 
workings behind the scenes, its 
all been at the SAB meetings. I 
thought he was going to be there

couldnt be there. If people want

The ECE department has taken 
overHH20! Run for the hills! This 
is worse than the Blob! Who knows 
where it will strike next?
Actually, the Space Allocation 
Board decided to give the room to 
the Electrical and Computer 
Engineering Department. ECE 
got the room because its space in 
Smith Hall (formerly Building B) 
was taken by the Department of 
International Education.
ECE needed more space, so the 
SAB looked around and found a 
not particularly heavily used 
computer cluster in the bowels of 
Hamerschlag Hall.
That cluster, containing 20 
computers, will now be converted 
into office space. Students who 
have forever dealt with computer 
shortages must now deal with a 
greater shortage. Andrew work
stations are rare enough, and now 
were losing some.
Aside from this immediate prob
lem, a long-term one has arisen. 
According to Vice President for 
Academic Services Bill Arms and 
Director of Academic Computing 
Jean Dexheimer, neither was con
sulted on the decision. ECE needed 
space, the SAB found some, and it 
was taken. CIT Dean Paul Christiano forcibly argues the opposite.
Christiano says he did not rec
ommend that ECE take the clus
ter. He also says he doesnt know 
who did. To him, the cluster is 
merely an ox that got gored.
Great attitude. Somebody 
needed that ox and he or she was 
never consulted on the decision to 
gore it. This is a university, not a 
neighborhood sandbox where 
everybody is fighting for the cor
ner with the most wet sand.
Although it may not be the most 
popular cluster on campus, stu
dents use HH20 and depend on its 
computers. The cluster also pro
vides jobs to CCons jobs gored 
along with the cluster.
The lack of space on campus is 
not news. We should be proud 
departments are growing and need 
more room. But, if you ask the 
various department heads, you 
will find that everybody needs 
more space. The Music and Drama 
departments need more rehearsal 
space, clubs need more office 
space, and the housing system is 
in a perpetual state of turmoil.
But somehow, somewhere, 
somebodys due process was vio
lated. Wed like to see Academic 
Computing get room for a new 
cluster  but not without letting 
everyone contribute to the deci
sion-making process.
CMU is a pretty small sandbox, 
kids, but its all weve got. Lets all 
play nice and try to get along.
PAT should serve everyone
To celebrate its 25th anniver
sary, the Port Authority of Al
legheny County has announced a 
new rate increase and restruc
tured fares and passes. It is, of 
course, an ironic announcement: 
Rate increases defeat one of pub
lic transportations purposesto 
provide inexpensive transporta
tion for those who cannot afford 
other means of getting around.
PATs brochure on the proposed 
changes claims that the majority 
of riders will not be affected by the 
increases. Apparently, college 
students are not in this majority, 
for student U-Tickets will be elimi
nated. Rather than receive a 25 
percent discount off the full fare, 
as with the current U-Ticket ($15 
for twenty rides), students will be 
expected to pay regular fares or 
buy regular passes.
Many students didnt know 
about the U-Ticket, and even if 
they did, they wouldnt know 
where to buy one. The Pittsburgh 
Symphony signs up students at 
the beginning of the year. Why

doesnt PAT?
An aggressive student market
ing campaign would increase ridership and revenue, and make the 
U-Ticket elimination unneces
sary. The University, too, could 
help by publicizing the student 
rate; at present the student guide
book doesnt even mention it.
U-Ticket elimination particu
larly affects our student body. Few 
students are able to afford  or 
parkcars at CMU. We need city 
buses because the CMU shuttle 
route is limited to the Oakland/ 
Shadyside area, and some stu
dents live outside Escorts radius.
Under the proposed plan, senior 
citizens will continue to ride for 
free during non-peak hours, but 
the student discount will be gone. 
Apparently, PAT doesnt include 
students in its slogan, Going the 
extra mile for you.
However, we shouldnt gloss over 
the fact that the PAT increases 
havent yet been finalized. See the 
story on page five for more infor
mation.
Editor:
The Port Authority of Allegheny 
County has proposed a restructuring of 
fares on the bus, subway, and incline 
mass transit system; this includes a fare 
increase.
In its brochure, PATs Proposal for 
Fares in January 1990, PAT states: 
The majority of PAT riders can avoid 
the higher fares by buying PAT tickets or 
passes in advance. However, this ma
jority does not appear to include college 
students, since student U-Tickets are 
proposed for elimination. Students would 
be expected to purchase regular tickets 
and passes, which, in essence, is a fare 
increase for students.
The sale of student U-Tickets started 
more than a decade ago, after discussion 
between local colleges and PAT on how 
to best serve student riders. With the 
cost of higher education continuing to 
increase, a PAT fare increase for stu
dents is unacceptable  particularly 
considering how many PAT riders will 
experience no increase at all! Until now, 
PAT, through operating subsidies pro
vided by the Federal Government, 
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and 
County of Allegheny, has supported the 
legitimate need of college students to 
have a transit fare more in line with 
their limited incomes. PAT now proposes 
to disregard this student heed.
Having been a college student not too 
long ago, and being employed by a local 
educational institution (the Buhl Sci
ence Center), I understand the financial 
pressures many students face. I am a 
former member of the Allegheny County 
Transit Council, a consumer advisory
Letters to the Editor
body which advises the PAT Board of 
Directors. I am writing to you to be sure 
you are aware of this threat to student 
transit fares.
If you share my sentiments on this 
matter, then I urge you to take action 
immediately. The fare increase will not 
take place until January. However, the 
decision will be made by the end of Octo
ber. A public hearing to receive oral and/ 
or written comments about the fare 
proposal will take place on Thursday, 
September 14, 1989 in South Meeting 
Room Number 2 of the Davitl L. Law
rence Convention Center, Penn Avenue 
at Tenth Street in downtown Pittsburgh. 
There will be two sessions: the first begins 
at 11:30 am, while the second begins at 5
pm. You can receive a time to speak by 
contacting Maureen Kelly at PAT: 237- 
7296, Monday through Friday between 
8:30 am and 4:30 pm.
I will be presenting oral testimony at 
this hearing, and I certainly will com
plain about the elimination of U-Tickets, 
However, it is very important that you 
also testify. The PAT Board of Directors, 
who will make the final decision, needs 
to hear from those who will be directly 
affected by this increase. If students ami 
colleges, who will be affected, do not 
testify, the PAT Board of Directors will 
assume they do not care  and PAT will 
act accordingly.
Please contact me if I can be of further 
assistance. I look forward to hearing 
your testimony on September 14.

Kiltie Band vice president 
offended by Tartan editorial
Editor:
I was offended by your remark about 
the Kiltie Band in last weeks editorial, 
Getting a Full Education. While I think 
the editorial made a good point, and 
while I even appreciate your attempt in 
that paragraph to evoke the less wellknown things all of us will remember 
about Carnegie Mellon, I feel you could 
have made positive comments, not nega
tive ones.
The Kiltie Band never claimed to be a 
precision, competitive marching band.
We enjoy music and we have fun with
out a rigorous practice schedule.
As a fourth year Kiltie Band member, 
I certainly will not cherish the memory 
of crooked lines as part of the fan of our 
organization. Why didnt you mention 
positive things like donning the kilts or 
screaming our unique cheers in the 
stands? Those are the things that I will 
remember fondly about the Kiltie band.
Bonita Asher
Vice President, Kiltie Band
Through college, we escape from the past
What is college supposed to be like? I 
feel... well, I dont know. I know that I 
feel different, sort of overwhelmed. It 
seems to be one of those things that hits 
you after the fact, when you have the 
time to stop and reflect. Walking down 
the street in your home town during 
Thanksgiving break, and you suddenly 
think Wait a minute, ! dont belong here 
I escaped. You look at all the kids still 
in high school, all of last years juniors, 
and you feel an enormous relief, a rush, 
that you are FINISHED with that part of 
your life; that you can go on and escape 
the restraints of past mistakes and gaffes 
of your history. You can start fresh, and 
try to make it good.
Start fresh and try to make it good? 
That doesnt sound too happy.
But, I defy you to find someone for 
whom college is not a starting over," or 
an escape. I dont mean starting over in 
the sense of being on your own, free from 
parents, but in the sense that everyone 
who came here is escaping something, be 
it an old boyfriend, soured friendships, 
or an unhappy childhood. They are es
caping the feeling of being trapped by the 
circumstances of birth and life.
Escape isnt easy, because no matter 
how much you yearned to be free of 
home, you were used to the place, used 
to the rhythms and sensations. College 
is an emotional roller coaster ride. It is a 
never ending series of up and downs, 
towering heights, and vistas.
I would like to Aeasure the stress on 
the average incoming freshman; not the 
everyday stresses like homework and 
schedules, but the unconscious stresses 
 meeting people, making impressions,
Don Picket
the sudden realization, on the first night 
alone, that you are ALONE. Your par
ents are headed away, and you are sleep
ing in the midst of 1200 people who are 
as scared and as lonely as you are. Being 
drunk helps a great deal.
That first sense of loneliness can be 
dangerous, as the isolation can become a 
comfort in itself. After a while, you get so 
used to being in your own world that the 
intrusions of others seem like too much 
bother. Offers of friendship can be turned 
down not out of misanthropy, but be
cause you just dont want to take the 
time to let relationships happen  you 
either leave them alone, or rush into 
them and ruin things by not letting the 
friendship happen by itself.
Friendships, escape, and emotional ups 
and downs can add up to one hell of an 
emotional baggage load. Carrying all that 
around gets tedious, and it needs a re
lease, needs someplace to go. Otherwise, 
it builds and builds, and you go, well, 
fucking nuts.
Back to where we startedcollege as 
an escape. But looking at all the stress 
and problems involved with this escape, 
is it worth it?
There seem to be people who were put 
on this earth to keep tabs on you, who 
never forget the time you screwed up in 
eighth grade, or the girl that turned you 
down freshman year. These people seem 
to thrive on remembering the mistakes 
of others.
In small communities these people are
never far away, never unwilling to dis
gorge their libraries of insults. That mind 
set is what I escaped fromthat confin
ing, cataloguing, nit-picking mind set| 
When someones life is so empty that il 
can only be filled by pointing out the mis
takes of others, then that person is in 
trouble. When an entire community livei 
by that false standard, then there is 
nothingleft to do but serve your time ani 
get the hell out. Run away from thi 
memories of childhood, from the physi
cal setting of childhood, to a place when 
no one knows you, where all the land
marks are unfamiliar, and where every
one starts from a fresh slate, free of an) 
history.
Is this the best thing about college? I 
it a place that lets you to grow beyond till 
restraints placed on you by your past?
If it is, then it is a very subtle charm 1 
college, because no one ever mentions il 
outright. This charm is referred to - 
school of individuals, no molds  bui 
it is never said outright, never admitted 
that college is as much of a refuge as 
place to learn. Is it any wonder why 
person looks back at college as the best 
time of his/her life? Probably not. Mos* 
people probably realize this only latei'Jj 
after college is over, when they are look
ing back from life, a job, a family,1 
history. They realize that here they wertl 
free for a while, free to act as they wantedconstrained only by those personal li' 
its they attached to themselves. Maybe' 
am sounding a little idealistic, maybe e[ 
are never that free, but you explain itDon Picket is a freshman in H&SS]

For many people, fraternity 
rush is one of the most enjoyable 
times of the year. Even as a nonGreek, I appreciate the fact that 
so many people seem to be having 
so much fun.
The problem is that, in the past, 
rush has also been one of the best 
times of the year to irritate 
members of the neighboring 
community, on and off campus.
Problems generally seem to 
arise when people start having 
too much fun and forget the world 
around them. Therefore, I would 
like to make one simple sugges
tion to everyone involved in this 
years rush: Go ahead and have
Jonathan Levy
fun, but think about what youre 
doing and keep it within reason
able limits.
The primary problem with par
ties is noise. Part of the enjoy
ment of many parties comes from 
listening and dancing to loud 
music. People living nearby know 
this and are generally tolerant.
However, fraternities need to 
realize that they are heavily 
dependent upon the goodwill of 
the community. Their parties 
regularly create a disturbance to
the neighborhood. These parties 
create a lot of noise for neighbor
ing dorms  more noise, in fact, 
than would be tolerated from 
parties within the dorms.
Also, the noise created by fra
ternity parties probably violates 
Pittsburghs noise statutes. 
Neighbors of the fraternities are 
willing to excuse a certain amount 
of noise, but when parties get too 
loud or remain loud too late, the 
fraternities lose the goodwill of 
students in nearby dorms and of 
the non-student residents of 
nearby houses. When these people 
start to find it necessary to call 
the CMU or Pittsburgh police,
everybody suffers, in some way.
Fraternities also need to think 
responsibly about their use of 
alcohol. Too many people seem to 
forget that underage drinking, as 
well as providing alcohol to mi
nors, is against the law. Maybe it 
is an unjust law. It is certainly a 
law which nearly everyone on this 
campus, including myself, has 
violated. But, it is still a law and, 
as 150 students found out when 
they were arrested in a raid on 
two fraternities in November 
1987, itis alaw which is occasion
ally enforced.
This does not mean that frater
nities should stop serving alco
hol, or that people should stop 
drinking. It just means that those 
hosting and attending the parties 
should realize that the Univer
sity and the state are willing to 
overlook underage drinking, but 
only to a certain point.
When people start drinking on 
fraternity porches or on sidewalks 
outside the houses, it becomes 
harder for the authorities to look 
the other way.
Similarly, when drinking leads 
to other problems such as fights, 
rape accusations stemming from 
questionable consent, and people 
making nuisances of themselves, 
the University and the police will
be forced to take action sooner or 
later.
In short, if the fraternities 
manage to keep their parties 
within reasonable limits, rush and 
other events throughout the year 
should provide a lot of fun for a lot 
of people. If, on the other hand, 
the fraternities allow things to 
get out of control, as they some
times have in the past, they will 
provide nothing but problems for 
themselves and others.

Im sorry that I dont have more 
time for this column, but Im stuck 
in a meeting.
It seems like Ive been to more 
meetings in the past two weeks 
than Donald Trump. Ive had team 
meetings for classes, organiza> tional meetings for the clubs I 
belong to, and even meetings for 
lunch.
Meetings can last as briefly as 
ten minutes or as long as three 
hours. There can be anywhere
- from one to one hundred other 
people in the meeting. All meet
ings, though, have certain char
acteristics in common.
First of all, all meetings follow 
Murphys Law of Time and
* Numbers. The time the meeting 
begins will be fifteen minutes after 
the scheduled time, and the 
number of people who show up for 
the meeting will never be the 
, number of people expected.
Second, all meetings have the 
same types of people show up at 
them: martyrs, clock watchers, 
sports fans, worriers, and missing-in-actions.
We all know the martyrs  the 
rare people who come to the 
^ meeting prepared and expect evr 
eryone else to also be prepared. I 
dont pretend to understand these 
people, but they are useful to have 
around.
Clock watchers are the people 
who come to the meeting under
- protest. They really dont want to 
be there and constantly remind
I the others of this fact.
Sports fans are relatively harm[ less people, until the meeting 
p begins. They come prepared to 
talk about any topic, except of 
course, the one for which the 
meeting was called. They will be 
able to tell you, though, who won 
every game in every sport the
night before.
Worriers come to the meeting 
and try to be productive, but think 
that they cant provide anything 
useful. They sit quietly, hoping 
that people will notice that they 
showed up, and hoping that no 
one will ask them to contribute 
anything.
Finally, there are the missingin-actions, the only people who 
actually enjoy themselves during
the meeting, because theyve 
skipped it to watch the Steeler 
game, go to PHI, or catch up on 
some sleep. They have a good time 
until the next day, when they find 
out that they have been assigned 
all of the grunt work that no one 
else wanted to do.
What type of meeting-goer am 
I? None of the above. I arrive at 
meetings on time, prepared, and 
get things done. Well, not always,
but I usually can talk my way out 
of things.
Sorry, Ive got to run now, Ive 
got a Management Game meet
ing, then there is my Tartan Board 
meeting, and lunch with Karyn...

%col!4ceibTartans clean up Wash U, 45-7
A rope, the 
rock, and me
I was never what you would call 
macho. I dont think Clint 
Eastwood drives a solid grey 78 
[Dodge with a Shalom Vail 
bumper sticker on the rear end.
But, I do love the mountains. In 
addition to teaching me which 
kinds of snakes are safe to eat,
I the Boy Scouts taught me to 
appreciate being out in the woods.
My friend Peter and I plan trips 
to the mountains whenever Im 
home.
On this last trip to the North 
Carolina highlands, ole Pete had 
alittle surprise forme. He and hisi
 mother, Patty, told me to meet 
them at a 711.
From there we drove up to the 
mountains where Petes girlfriend 
Jane and her father Tony (a real 
mountain type) were waiting at a 
small rest stop. With the cast of 
characters now in mind, the 
drama unfolds.
We hiked for a while, went to a 
small tourist trap an d had lunch, 
and then Jim said, OK, lets go 
play on some rocks.
I: Wedroveforawhileandstopped 
at a small, gravel parking area 
where people stopped to eat lunch 
and change flats.
* Tony started getting all these 
ropes and things out of the back of 
the 4x4. We were in front of an 80- 
fbot, sheer face, granite rock. 
'Good, aint it, he said.
Pete said, Bitchin, dude!
; Patty said, Ooowee.
 Jane said, Wheres my Ricky 
Scaggs tape?
I kept quiet and searched for 
that bit of Clint inside me.
! Tony found an easy way up the 
side. He tied off a rope on top and 
t rappelled down.
! Before I knew it, he had the 
harness on me and had me hooked 
up to the rope. I climbed up 10 feet 
and rappelled down. I dont know 
why, I just did it.
9 Pete did a few of these practice 
runs also, since he had never 
rappelled either, then he and Tony 
went up. Pete is more of a ma
cho type anyway.
Watching them come down an 
^0-foot mountain didnt seem like 
any mean trick, so I didnt hesi
tate when Tony looked at me and 
said, Your turn, kid.
At the top, Tony hooked me up 
and guided me back to the edge. I 
^-thought, If I dont look down, Ill 
lie cool. Then Tony said, Look 
down so you can guide yourself. 
Thats when I froze.
I was going to walk forward, 
unhook myself and walk back 
down. But Tony, experienced in 
"ealing with rookies, calmly said, 
Sit down. Doing so in the har
ness caused me to flatten out so I 
Was now perpendicular to the 
rock. I stepped clear of the edge 
and was standing on the rock, 
defying gravity. Then fear was 
gone. I was rappelling.
When I got to the ground, I 
heard loud applause behind me. 
People had actually pulled off the 
side of the road to watch us. Then 
-Jfie rush hit me. I ran back up the 
mountain. I could have rappelled 
all day long. I found the Clint 
Eastwood inside me.
I did something I never even 
Imagined myself doing. I let go, I 
_flew. But what is really wonder4*1 is that the rush didnt end 
when I touched down. I still have 
&at rush.
j.Those people gave me a won
derful gift, something Ill carry 
with me my whole life.
Every time I look at a mounor a even a building, I go 
back to that day, and think, How 
*ould I climb it?

Dean Garofola carries the ball Into Bear-Infested territory. The Tartans ran for 396 yards In the win Saturday.
By STEWART LEVINE
Tartan Copy Manager
University Athletic Association 
rival, Washington University, 
came into Mt. Lebanon this week
end, hoping merely to slow down 
the Tartans. It didnt happen. 
Instead, the Bears were run into 
the ground by a merciless Carne
gie Mellon ground game in a 45-7 
rout.
Its nice to see the old Carnegie 
Mellon again, said Head Coach 
Rich Lackner. The win was CMXTs 
first since a 44-0 homecoming 
win against Thiel last October.
Today was fun, a lot of fun, 
said senior guard Russ Hann. The 
entire Tartan backfield shared in 
the fun, with fourteen players 
rushing for 396 yards and five 
touchdowns. Junior halfback 
Scott Bamyak led the way with 
102 yards.
After an error-filled opener 
against Duquesne, Carnegie 
Mellon (1-1,1-0 UAA) regrouped, 
avoiding the crucial mistakes 
which led to the loss against the 
Dukes.
We didnt do anything differ
ent, said junior defensive line
man Carlos Rodriguez. The de
fense, which gave up 277 yards 
and 16 first downs one week ago, 
held Washington (0-1,0-1 UAA) 
to only 150 yards and 11 first 
downs.
The Tartans got to work early 
against the Bears. After the two 
teams traded punts, Carnegie 
Mellon put together a typical 
Tartan drive  run left, ruri 
right, run up the middle, and then 
run again. Eight runs and one 
pass brought the Tartans 
downfield, allowing junior full
back Fran Bellante to punch the 
ball home from the five yard line, 
giving the Tartans a 7-0 lead.
After the Bears next drive 
stalled, Carnegie Mellon made its 
only major mistake of the game. 
On third and ten, deep in Tartan; 
territory, Carnegie Mellon quar-; 
terback Billy Snyder lost the: 
handle on the ball. It was recov
ered by Washingtons Neal Mitch
ell.

They did it again.
Carnegie Mellons Mens CrossCountry team added two more 
wins to the NCAA dual meet rec
ord last Saturday.
It was an unbearably hot and 
humid day as the Tartans de
feated Frostburg College and 
Duquesne University at their first 
home meet of the season.
The win against Duquesne was 
not a surprise after their over
whelming victory last week, but 
they were up against stiff compe
tition with Frostburg.
Carnegie Mellon's number one 
runner, senior Dave Supp, once 
again led the team to victory in 
26:02. Although he had a consid
erable lead throughout the meet, 
Lesser, a runner from Frostburg 
was not out of sight, placing sec
ond in 26:17.
The next two runners, sopho
mores Russ Shorkey and Jon 
Frieder, came across the finish 
line together in 26:45. Shorkey 
and Frieder ran the entire race 
together, which Frieder states 
helped him through some of the 
difficult sections of the meet.
Shorkey, who ran a surprising 
race last week at the first meet,
After last week, it was important to 
me that I could prove to myself that I 
could run consistently.
_________ CMU runner Russ Shorkey
placing second overall, was 
pleased with the outcome of Sat
urdays race. He says, After last 
week, it was important to me that 
I could prove to myself that I 
could run consistently, and he 
certainly has so far this season.
Also having a good day, in spite 
of the heat, was junior Gary
Harrison in 5th place with 27:04, 
followed by seniors Gary Meeker 
and Len ONeal.
The weather was an important 
factor in Saturdays race. The 
times were significantly slower 
than usual on the teams home 
course at Schenley Park. Supp 
has run the course almost a minute faster in previous meets.
Fortunately for the Tartans, the 
team was well hydrated before 
the meet, as Head Coach Gary 
Meckley anticipated a hot and 
humid day.
Frostburg, a highly ranked 
team in the region, was possibly, 
the toughest team the Tartans; 
face this season in dual meets, 
making this an important win for 
the team.
Carnegie Mellon has begun 
the season with three wins al
ready and will be attending an 
invitational at Indiana Univer
sity in Pennslylvania next Satur
day.

Lady Tartans down 
Duquesne, Frostburg State 
in second meet of season
By ALIM RAY
Tartan Staffwriter
Womens Cross Country Coach Dario 
Donatelli expected both a close and an 
easy meet Saturday. Sure enough, the 
Lady Tartans comfortably beat 
Dusquesne University by a score of 
33-24, but just passed Frostburg State 
University with a 30-27 score.
Donatellis strategy was to key off the 
Frostburg runners and ignore 
Dusquesne, since the Tartans beat 
Dusquesne last week. Frostburg had 
proved its talent with last years sixthplace finish in the region. Judging by the 
Frostburg squad last season, Donatelli 
felt his team had to place its fifth, sixth 
and seventh runners ahead of Frost
burgs fifth.
After the race, Donatelli admitted that
he did not think CMU would defeat; 
Frostburg, though he thought it would! 
be close. But, he said, the heat helped 
us. Frostburg team members wore them
selves out in the heat with their fast 
starting pace.
On the other hand, Donatelli said the 
Lady Tartans went out conservative, 
because they knew the course, so the, 
heat did not affect them as much.

Tartan volleyball hosts first tourney, loses three out of four
By KATIE CULBERTSON
Tartan Asst. Sports Editor
The Carnegie Mellon Womens 
Volleyball toumamentmay seem 
disappointing, but the Lady Tar
tans, despite losing three out of 
four matches and not placing in 
the tournament, learned some 
valuable lessons.
Going into the tournament, the 
Lady Tartans did not expect to 
come away winners, but wanted 
to give freshmen some much 
needed playing time and experi
ence, as well as get a feel for the 
teams ability to play together. It 
was also a good test of versatility.
Sue [Coach Flaherty] wanted 
to try out different things, said 
junior Cindy Peperak. We have 
so many people that can do so
many different things. Im confi
dent we can rotate positions. 
The tournament wasnt that 
big of a deal, said senior co-captain Laurie Shumaker. Well 
never see those teams again this 
season.
The Tartans are more concerned 
about Presidential Athletic Con
ference (PAC) and University 
Athletic Association (UAA) 
matches later this season, none of 
which will be against teams met 
in the tournament. The real test 
will come when CMU plays Uni
versity of Chicago and University 
of Rochester in October, said 
Peperak. Those are much more 
important matches," she said.'
On Friday night, Carnegie 
Mellon defeated West Virginia 
Wesleyan but lost to Mercyhurst.
The Tartans lost both matches on 
Saturday to Seton Hill and 
Baldwin-Wallace, ending their 
tournament play. All matches 
were decided in two games. We 
could have played much better, 
but were not too upset, said 
junior Nicole Hanak.
According to Hanak, the team 
is too optimistic about a good 
season to be very disappointed in 
the tournament. Were going to 
have a much better season this 
year than we did last year, she 
said. We have much more team 
this year.
Peperak is confident that the 
Lady Tartans can win the PAC. 
The UAA, she said, would be 
interesting, but the team would 
like to do well there also. A major

CMU-NYU soccer
By JASON MCDONALD
Tartan Stafifwriter
After losing last weeks game 
against New York University, 
the Carnegie Mellon soccer 
team and head coach Nick 
Gaudioso expected a very tough 
game when the two teams 
played a rematch last Satur
day. However, NYU never re
ally got into the game and lost 
3-0.
UAA competi
tion is a whole 
different caliber 
of play.
 Head Coach 
Nick Gaudioso
The main element of the Tar
tans game plan was a gamelong man-to-rnan defensive 
coverage against NYUs best 
player. This strategy worked 
well, limiting the Violets to a 
total of four shots on the after
noon, all of which were handled 
well by goalie Glenn Hoogerwerf.
The Tartans job was also 
made easier by putting points 
on the board early. Eddie Park 
scored the first Tartan goal near 
the 15 minute mark of the first 
half, and Rob Schaefer, who 
also had two assists, scored 
later to give the Tartans a 2-0
lead at halftime.
Young Kang finished out the 
scoring early in the second half, 
but the heat and humidity pre
vented the score from being a 
lot worse. We had  lot of op
portunities in the game, but 
we were too worn out by the 
heat to capitalize, explained 
Gaudioso.
Gaudioso mentioned several 
factors that figured in the sur
prisingly easy victory.
Most of our success came 
about because we had so many 
chances to score, and we got 
ahead of them so early in the 
game. It also helped that were 
a much more technical team 
than NYU, said Gaudioso.
Gaudioso also cited the fact 
that the game was being played 
on Astroturf as a reason for the 
Tartans strong performance.
The victory raised the Tar
tans overall record to 1-1 as 
they return home to play Hiram 
College on Wednesday. Gaudi
oso gives the team a clean bill 
of health; only one player has 
any injuries worth mentioning, 
so the team is optimistic.
Coach Gaudioso sums up the 
teams feelings for the game 
against the Terriers: Theyve 
beaten us the last few years, so 
we expect a tough game. How
ever, the previous losses may 
give us a little bit of a revenge 
factor. Its going to be impor
tant that we get ourselves up 
for these next several games 
because UAA (University Ath
letic Association) competition 
is a whole different caliber of 
play.

Tartan Asst. Features Editor
For the past two years, Spirit 
has won the majors IM football 
trophy. This year, they wont. With 
the loss of several key players, 
including the most valuable 
player, Robert Bowie, Spirit A 
decided to enter the intermediate 
level of football.
Only four teams will be in the 
majors level of IM football this 
year: ATO, Beta, Pika and GSIA. 
Last year, ATO lost the champi
onship game to Spirit. ATO will 
probably win the league, but 
theyll lose a game or two along 
the way.
For the past two years, Spirit has won 
the majors IM football trophy. This 
year, they won't.
Beta and Pika will do their best 
to stop the ATO brothers, but 
they wont be able to defeat them 
in the long run.
GSIA did not have a team in the 
major league last year; I havent 
seen them play, so they could be a 
decent team. However, if GSIA 
plays like SUPA did last year, the 
grad students wont stand a
chance of winning.
In the intermediate league, the 
teams with the best chances of 
winning the champic-iship game 
are: SAE (last years winner), 
Sudsuckers (lost to SAE in the 
championship game), and Spirit 
A (the revamped team that won 
the majors championship last 
year).
The intermediate level of com
petition will probably be more 
competitive and more exciting 
than the race for the majors trophy.
In the minors league, last years 
winner, Delta Tau Delta, will have 
the best chance of clinching the 
title. There are several other 
teams that could prevent the Delts 
from repeating: PAD, Spirit B, 
and ECE Drams.
None of these predictions could 
come true of course, since there 
are many unknown teams in the 
intermediate and minors. There 
may be a good team that will take 
everyone by surprise with its 
abilities.

interesting," but the team would 
like to do well there also. A major 
advantage ofthis years team over 
last years is depth, said Peperak. 
Theres a lot of bench strength. 
Even with six good players on the 
court, there are still three or four 
on the bench.

goal and an end zone sack gave 
the Tartans five more points, 
pushing the lead to 38-7 before 
the Tartans mounted one final 
drive culminating with Jeff 
Kubalas touchdown to close out 
the scoring.
That was exactly what we 
wanted to do and what we had to 
do, said Lackner after the game. 
A good football team is going to

weeks and were a good football

This Week: The Tartans travel 
to the Windy City to take on the 
University of Chicago Maroons. 
The game begins at 2:30 pm and 
will be broadcast on WRCT-FM 
(88.3).
The Maroons will rely on their 
own running game, led by last 
years team leader in both running 
and receiving, Brian Blitz. Their 
defense will be led by linebacker 
Jamie Little, one of College

No one goes fast 
if they hate what 
theyre doing'
By HOWDY PIERCE
Tartan Editor-in-Chief
6:05 am. Its still dark outside, and the 
commands which fill the air seem to be 
unattached to the bodies who shout them. 
Up to your waist... ready, up!
The flurry of activity is centered around 
1 an eighteen-wheel trailer parked in the 
weeds near the Allegheny River. Al
though an observer can dimly make out 
objects outside the trailer, whatever lies 
inside is obscured in darkness.
Watch the rigging! Still, nothing is 
) visible.
Take it out! A woman appears in the 
trailer door, her hands stretched high in 
the air. Way enough! The woman jumps 
to the ground and turns to receive the 
bow end of a small, streamlined boat, 
i Take it out! The boat emerges farther, 
and another woman appears. Way 
enough! She, too, drops to the ground. 
Take it out!
Soon, two more women and the rest of 
the boat have emerged from the trailer. 
A fifth, smaller woman  the one giving 
the commands jumps out of the trailer 
after them. She guides the boat holders 
down a narrow, muddy path in the weeds 
which leads to a wooden dock floating in 
the water.
Okay, ready to roll... ready, roll! The 
four women roll the 140-pound boat 
smoothly into the water alongside the 
dock. They busy themselves with attach
ing the boats four oars to it; when all are 
done, each removes her shoes. In two 
sets of two, they enter the boat. The fifth 
hops in last, and the teammates shove 
their boat away from the dock.
For the members of the Carnegie 
Mellon crew team, teamwork isnt a 
concept taken lightly. In fact, they cite 
crew as one of the ultimate team sports 
 where coordinated teamwork is nec
essary just to get the boat in the water.
There are very few sports where you 
have to do everything together in just the 
same way, says Liz Winter, the teams 
head coach. You have a responsibility to 
the rest of your crewmates that is not 
quite as pointed in other sports.
In fact, says Winter, the members of a 
crew team typically do everything to
gether. Theres a bonding process that 
goes on within crews, she says. That 
makes it a very special sport.
It is now 6:20 am, and light is just be
ginning to show on the rivers edge. After 
filling a gas tank and attaching a motor, 
Winter is ready to take out her launch, a 
small motorboat she rides to pace the 
crew team and offer suggestions on im
provement.
Soon she, too, has pushed off from the 
dock; after about a minute of travelling 
on open throttle, she has caught up with 
the team that has just left the dock. They 
are approaching the downstream end of 
the island from which they launched and 
are about to enter the Allegheny River 
proper.
Sophie, well head upstream today, 
Winter says through her megaphone. 
The fifth woman in the boat  the only 
one seated facing frontturns her head 
and nods.
Junior Sophie Chiang is the team's 
coxswain. She has the responsibility of 
steering the boat, planning the teams 
strategy on the water, watching where 
the boat is going, and coordinating the 
efforts of the four rowers. In return for 
her services, she gets a free ride from her 
teammates.
Chiang shouts a command which is 
unintelligible on the launch, drowned in 
the roar of the motor. But her four crew
mates respond, and the boat turns and 
begins to head upstream. About 20 yards 
away, a fish breaks water, causing a 
splash.
Each of the four rowers sits on a seat 
facing the rear attached to runners in 
the boat, allowing the seat  and hence 
the person  to glide forward and back
ward. Mounted in front of each seat is 
what looks to be a pair of running shoes.
Each member of the team rows only 
one oar; the two that row on the left are 
called ports while the two that row on 
the right are known as starboards. 
Since the seats move, taking a stroke re
quires a full-body effort; strength from 
the legs and the arms is transferred to 
the oar.
Over her megaphone, Winter tells the 
team that shell be right back, and 
heads over to two other boats; these two 
are mens singles. Winter asks how 
theyre doing, offers a few suggestions, 
and tells the two to practice while cir
cling the island. Then she heads up
stream to catch up'with the womens four 
crew terminology meaning a boat with 
four sweeps and a coxswain.
Today, the team will work on the 
boats balance. Winter watches for a while 
as the team rows, offering occasional 
suggestions. Then, satisfied that the 
problem is corrected, she tells Chiang to 
take the team upstream working three 
sets of eight minutes, full pressure, four 
minutes, light pressure. As she paces 
them in the launch, she offers occasional 
suggestions over her megaphone.
No one goes fast if they hate what 
theyre doing, Winter will say later. If

Womens options: Anna Balletbo unveils a European perspective
By NATALIE PETERSON
Tartan Staffwriter
This years Presidents Distin
guished Lecture Series got off to a 
commendable start last Thurs
day with a thought-provoking 
presentation by Spanish feminist 
Anna Balletbo. As a woman in
volved in Spains academia as well 
as in its parliament, Balletbo is 
recognized as one of her countrys 
most prominent female figures. 
Her lecture, entitled Feminism 
Today: A Prospective From Eu
rope, offered insights into the 
nature, success, and future goals 
of the womens movement in Eu
rope.
Balletbo began her discussion 
by acknowledging the difficulty 
of speaking collectively about 
European women: In Europe, 
there are a lot of different cul
tures, languages, traditions, char
acters, and customs. For this 
reason, Balletbo believes that 
womens rights have been ap
proached by the women of Europe 
in different ways. As an illustra
tion of this point, some European

its hell out there, somethings 
wrong. I try not to shove  I tell 
them what they need to do to get 
where they want to be.
According to the people that do 
it, crew is a sport requiring great 
precision  and hence coaching 
about even minute details. Crew 
is a blend of power and precision, 
says Winter. It doesnt work when 
you pull harder. You have to pull 
and think.
The crew team is quick to praise 
Winters style of coaching. Shes 
very patient  a good teacher, 
says team member Liz Gross. A 
Tot of the people here learned eve
rything from her. Most of them 
had no crew experience before 
they started.
Its now close to 7 am, and fully 
light outside. Heading upstream, 
the launch thunks as it hits a 
bottle floating on the surface of 
the Allegheny. Although last 
nights rain washed a lot of Utter 
into the river, Winter says its 
pretty clean for the Allegheny.
Theres a lot of rubbish that comes 
down. This is nothing  in the 
spring, its trees, whole trees.
Thats fun.
Actually, Winter thinks the riv
ers in Pittsburgh are some of the 
better ones to row on. The qual
ity of the water is actually prettyl9yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
i 
i
The laws have really changed... But 
one thing is law and another thing is 
practice... Anna Balletbo
quite clear that all women, 
whether European or American, 
face many of the same obstacles 
in their quest for equality.
One of the biggest problems 
faced by womens movements 
everywhere has been the tendency 
of many of the people in power, 
usually but not always men, to ig
nore established laws prohibiting 
discrimination against women. 
Balletbo tempered her praise for 
the legislative changes of the past 
few decades with the recognition 
that the laws have sometimes 
been neutralized by less than 
diligent enforcement: The laws 
have really changed. By now, 
there is no country in Europe that 
can have a law that discriminates 
against women... But one thing is 
law and one thing is practice. Of 
course you need the law to give 
you the right, but the law only is 
not enough.
She illustrated the depth of this 
problem with a recent sexual
harassment case from her own 
country. Referring to the case as 
the sentence of the short skirt, 
Balletbo described how a Spanish 
employer who sexually harassed 
one of his female employees was 
acquitted by a judge who ruled 
that he had been provoked by the 
employees short skirt.
Angry Spanish women retali
ated with a unique response: The 
women of Spain called a day of 
the short skirt when all of the 
women of Spain would wear a 
short skirt. Sure enough, on the 
chosen day, women throughout 
the country sported their short 
skirts. Even the wife of Premier 
Gonzales wore a short skirt, 
Balletbo added.
According to Balletbo, such 
responses to discrimination are 
becoming increasingly popular in 
Europe, where women often lobby 
and organize to end illegal dis
crimination against women.
The media has been an espe
cially effective instrument in such 
struggles. On the day of the short 
skirt, extensive television and 
newspaper coverage helped the 
women to bring their point across 
to the entire country.
Another major problem that 
Balletbo believes European 
women must resolve is that of 
juggling both a family and a ca
reer. Balletbo explained that 
while a large number of Euro
pean women work outside the 
home, they are still responsible 
for the social work of caring for 
the home and children. Unfortu
nately, this problem is not as 
easily addressed through group 
efforts and media coverage.
Balletbo concluded her discus
sion by acknowledging the diffi
culty of balancing career and 
family and pointed out that, in 
order for women to escape the 
endless responsibilities of the 
home, there must first be an 
emancipation of men, a change 
in male mentalities that will ease 
the burden upon women and make 
things better for all generations. 
While Balletbos observations 
were directed at the plight of 
women in Europe, her insights 
seemed to be applicable to the 
challenges faced by women eve
rywhere.
Theres a bonding process that goes 
on within crews. That makes it a very 
special sport.
 Liz Winter
good, although it can get rough, 
she says. But I reckon weve got 
a good four-mile stretch to prac
tice on, and thats quite a lot. The 
only place where thats matched 
is in London.
But, says Gross, the fact that 
the Allegheny is used for ship
ping is not necessarily a blessing 
for the crew team. An industrially-used river is different than a 
regular river. The city of Pitts
burgh depends a lot on its rivers, 
and there are barges coming down 
the river. Weve had some bad 
experiences.
By 7:40, the boat is waitingback 
by the dock. Although one mem
ber has an 8:30 class, the team 
must wait for a Pitt crew to clear 
the dock before it can get out of 
the water. A second Carnegie 
Mellon team  this one a mens 
fouris waiting to take the boat 
back out. And a Duquesne team 
waits nearby for CMU to unload 
and load.

The boathouse  which is just

competition, as well as practice 
with more people at a time. But, 
says Winter, an eight can cost 
$13,000, and shes busy looking 
for donors using a trick borrowed 
from the Universitys current 
capital campaign: If someone 
gives us the money for a boat, 
well call it after them.
Currently, the team is prepar
ing for the Head of the Ohio, the 
only crew event held in Pitts
burgh. Races will go on all day on 
September 30; they will run from 
the new boathouse near 31st 
Street to the Point downtown.
I feel optimistic about this 
year, says Winter. Its going to 
be a lot of hard work, but it is
going to be wonderful.
For her part, Gross knows what 
it is that gets her out of bed every 
morning at 5:35. Theres some
thing that happens when youre 
in a boat with four people, she 
says. Its like a little team. I cant 
explain it. When you feel like the

got your balance, it feels great.

Michael Elfenbein, a IM senior, seen here In Kyoto with two Japanese students. Elfenbein spent a 
semester in Japan studying the language and culture as a complement to his Carnegie Mellon curriculum.
You're the coolest person in the world if you're an 
American.... All the guys want to be friends with you, 
and all the girls want to go out with you.
 Michael Elfenbein
stead of his reading the menu in 
English.
According to Elfenbein, one 
significant difference between the 
Japanese and Western cultures 
is in the educational systems. In 
Japan, students spend many, 
many hellish years trying to get 
into a good university; high school 
is difficult. But once youre in, you 
network, have fun, and think of 
the wonderful job youre going to 
get when you get out. He adds 
that Japanese universities dont 
give homework or tests, only one 
final in each class.
Another element of Japanese 
culture that Elfenbein found dif
ficult to adjust to was the Japa
nese reaction to Americans. He 
said that both his best and the 
worst experiences during his stay 
stemmed from the fact that, the 
Japanese treated me like a king.
On the more positive side, be
cause the Japanese idolize 
Americans, American students at 
Keio and across Japan are treated 
to a lively social life; in his words, 
Youre the coolest person in the 
world if youre an American... all 
the guys want to be friends with 
you and all the girls want to go 
out with you.
Elfenbein cites many times
when he would get into a night
club for free or have drinks sent to 
his table, sometimes by people he 
didnt even know, because he was 
an American. He says that many 
Japanese want to meet Ameri
cans because they are eager to 
test out their English and are 
thrilled and excited to hear them 
testing out their Japanese.
On the down side, all of the 
attention can get to be stifling. 
The Japanese interest in Ameri
cans coupled with their expecta
tions about entertaining an hon
ored guest can make a foreigner 
uncomfortable.
Elfenbein remembers that all 
of his friends and his host family 
wanted to show him off to their 
100 neighbors. Also, he felt he 
had to be careful not to make 
seemingly casual comments ex
pressing discomfort; If I said that 
it was sunny out, they would run 
around all over town looking for 
sunglasses. His hosts were acco
modating in a way that was nor
mal to them, but above and be
yond what Americans consider 
necessary to comfort.
While Elfenbein was at Keio, he 
had the opportunity to join the 
Globe Society, a secret organiza
tion started by an Oxford student
with an original membership; 
of 9 Japanese students and 9 
foreigners.
In the semester that Elfen
bein joined, three other Ameri
cans also joined the group. The 
Globe Society offers a variety 
of social functions for its 
members, including dinners 
with well-known guest speak
ers, such as Mr. Seiko of Seiko 
watches.
Will Elfenbein go back to 
Tokyo? I cant wait to go back 
after I graduate, he says, 
without hesitation. Elfenbein 
wants to go into information 
systems, which he says is a 
large market that is about to 
open up in Japan. He would 
recommend the program to 
anyone who thinks he or she 
might want to travel abroad.
FortheCMU student who is 
interested in this or another 
exchange program, the Office 
for International Education, 
which is located in the Buearu 
of Mines, Building B, offers a 
variety of informational bro
chures to inform the student 
as to his options. The staff is 
eager to assist in any way 
possible to make the students 
experience enjoyable.

American student in Japan brings
By JOEY LYNN MONACO
Tartan Features Editor
As many international busi
nessmen would agree, in the 
international business com
munity, understanding how 
another culture operates can 
make the difference between a 
successful venture and sure 
failure. So when senior indus
trial management major Mi
chael Elfenbein had the op
portunity to go to Japan last 
semester, he was thrilled to be 
able to explore the country 
first-hand.
Elfenbein had studied Japa
nese for three semesters and 
wanted to learn more about 
the Japanese culture and es
pecially the J apanese business 
atmosphere. He was the first 
Carnegie Mellon student to 
participate in the recentlyfounded international ex
change program with Keio 
University in Tokyo.
Elfenbein attended the 
Japanese language program 
available to international stu
dents at Keio  where he was
one of about 100 students from 
around the world to attend the 
program. The American students 
came from such prestigious 
schools as Harvard and Dart
mouth.
Elfenbein assures, however, 
that Carnegie Mellon is a name 
that carries more weight with the 
Japanese than some ofthe the Ivy 
League schools do, since its re
search topics coincide more closely 
with those studied in Japan; they 
hear more news from Carnegie 
Mellon research than from the 
other schools.
Originally, Elfenbein wasnt the 
student slotted to represent Car
negie Mellon at Keio, but since 
the student who had orignially 
agreed to go backed out at the last 
minute, Elfenbeins interest in the 
Keio program prompted both of 
the universities to accept him as a 
replacement candidate. Instead 
of the usual year-long program, 
however, Elfenbein prepared for 
a one-semester study.
Based on his experiences in 
Japan, Elfenbein stresses the im
portance of the cultural look at 
another country which he feels

he gained from the Keioexchange; 
exploring the differences as well 
as the similarities between cul
tures is an enriching experience 
for any student, not only one going 
into international business.
Normally when a student wants 
to attend Keio, he faces the re
sponsibility of finding his own 
housing in Tokyo. According to 
Elfenbein, Tokyo is probably the 
most expensive city in the world. 
He estimates that for a small 
apartment located about an hour 
and a half away from the campus, 
a student would pay roughly 
$1000 dollars per month.
Elfenbein was saved from this 
expense because he was offered a 
highly-coveted place in a home 
stay program, which enabled him 
to stay with a J apanese family for 
the duration of his studies. His 
host family, the Tomosue family, 
wanted to host an international 
student because they had ahighschool age daughter staying in 
Australia on another exchange 
program.
At first, he says, they were over
bearing, and expected him to live 
by rules that, by American stan
dards, were very strict. It was a 
learning experience for eveiyone; 
once the family became accus
tomed to him and his American 
way of thinking, they loosened up 
their restrictions.
Living with a host family and 
experiencing typical home life in 
Japanese or any other culture is a 
big part of getting a feel for a 
society, as Elfenbein sees it. He 
recalls the growing rapport and 
the home cooked meals with his 
adopted family as one of the most 
pleasant experiences of the trip. 
He will keep in touch with them.
Japanese night life differs from 
American in that it starts much 
earlier. Elfenbein states that 
nightclubs are lively at 7 pm and 
close ar0undl0:30. And the clubs 
where the Americans go are con
sidered cool. Telling them youre 
a model if youre an American will 
get you into many clubs free.
Elfenbein feels that through his 
close connections with his host 
family and Japanese friends he 
experienced Japanese culture on 
a different and much deeper level 
than the American tourist does.
He toured Thailand, Hong 
Kong, and parts of China with 
friends, and got a very different 
view of them than from an 
American hotel room. For ex
ample, he found some restaraunts 
off of the regular track of the 
tourists; letting his friends read 
his menus for him in the local lan
guage made the price go down inIF 111 Jill /^F werli2 Pse1

Southside Johnny plays Flagstaff Hill
By MICHAEL SCHWARTZ
Tartan Staffwriter
AB is sponsoring a concert this 
Sunday at 2 pm on Flagstaff Hill 
featuring Southside Johnny and 
the Jukes. The show will start at 
2 with local comedian, Keith 
Leslie, followed by Southside 
Johnny at 3.
Johnny Lyon, better known as 
Southside Johnny, grew up lis
tening to oldjazz, blues and R&B. 
His father played with a group 
called The Scarlet Syncopators^ 
from 1930 until about the time of 
World War II.
Where did the nickname come 
from? It was when he was re
hearsing with a group called Dr. 
Zoom and the Sonic Boom that 
Southside Johnny was born. As 
he explains, At the time, I was 
basically known for playing Chi
cago blues, and since the South 
Side is where it all happened, the 
name sort of popped up and stuck.
The band, Southside Johnny 
and the Asbury Jukes, made their 
debut at the Stone Pony in Asbury 
Park in June of 1974. They re
corded a demo tape and distrib
uted to several record companies. 
Somehow, radio personality Kid 
Leo of WMMS in Cleveland got 
hold of a copy of the demo tape 
and played it, sparking many re
quests for the bands songs. 
Although they had no record 
contract, the band went ahead 
and recorded I Dont Want To Go 
Home, their first album.
Later, Epic Records signed the
Id rather be hopelessly romantic 
than cynical, cool and so wrapped up 
in the self that the emotion gets trun
cated. This music is the most open 
expression of emotion I could come 
up with."
9 Johnny Lyon (Southside Johnny)
band. Their reputation began to 
spread outside the New Jersey 
area following the release of their 
second album, This Time Its For 
Real. But it was the third album 
that really established Johnnys 
place in rock n roll history. Voted 
one of the Top 100 albums of the 
past 20 years by Rolling Stone 
magazine, it was the last album 
featuring original guitarist Mi
ami Steve Van Zandt. Van Zandt 
left the group to join Bruce Spring
steens E Street Band, but he 
maintains contact with his old 
band by managing, producing, 
and writing for the Jukes.
Following At Least We Got 
Shows, which spawned such ra
dio favorites as Hard to Find 
and Walk Away Renee, Johnny 
struck out to make his first solo 
record. South Side, the new al
bum, is co-produced by Steve 
Skinner. Says Johnny of the al
bum, Ive brought songs to my 
band and turned them into Jukes 
songs. In the past, I wanted that
and I wrote for that structure  
the horn-oriented, R&B-based, 
rock n roll band that Steve and I 
started. This time I needed to 
step out. The new record is more 
of an expression of what I wanted 
to hear from these songs.
Slow Dance is a diversity of 
sounds from the up-beat, danceoriented track Aint That Pecu
liar, to the the bluesy sound of 
Little Calcutta. Theres a 
wealth of styles out there, and I 
want to explore them all, says 
Johnny. This album is part of 
that. Ive been reviewed a lot, and 
the New York Times once called 
me a 'neo-romantic. I was very 
flattered. Id rather be hopelessly 
romantic than cynical, cool and so 
wrapped up in the self that the 
emotion gets truncated. This 
music is the most open expres
sion of emotion I could come up 
with.
Sunday. Flagstaff. 2 pm. Be 
there for the first AB concert of 
the year.

By DAWN BROSONSKI
Tartan Asst. Diversions Editor
Broadway makes its trium
phant return to Pittsburgh with 
the upcoming production of Gypsy 
at the Benedum Center. This New 
York-bound show will play Sep
tember 19-24, and tickets are on 
sale now.
Patrons of the Benedum Center 
remember last years spectacular 
Broadway season, highlighted by 
sold-out runs of Cats and Les Mis
erables. This year, the series splits 
venues, with three productions 
being raised at the Benedum and 
three at Heinz Hall.
The schedule reads like a thea
tergoers fondest dream. Included 
are out-of-town tryouts (shows 
that are touring before opening 
on Broadway) of Tennessee 
Williams Cat on A Hot Tin Roof, 
starring Kathleen Turner, in
January; the world tour revival of 
Fiddler on the Roof, starring 
Topol, who originated the charac
ter of Tevye, in October; and 
Gypsy, which is scheduled for an 
autumn Broadway opening.
The seasons other three pro
ductions are Andrew Lloyd 
Webbers dazzling musical-onwheels, Starlight Express, in 
November; the American touring 
production of Tim Rices London 
hit Chess, featuring the songs 
One Night In Bangkok and I 
Know Him So Well; and, in the 
spring, a revival of Shirley 
MacLaineFrom Broadway To 
Hollywood and Back!, the actress 
musical autobiography. MacLaines show may also be Broadway-bound next year.
Gypsy was suggested by the 
memoirs of burlesque dancer 
Gypsy Rose Lee. The central 
characters, young Gypsy and her
mother Mama Rose, lead an 
emotional tour of the heart and 
soul of show-business life.
The show features music by Jule 
Styne and lyrics by Stephen Sond
heim, including such tunes as 
Small World, Some People, 
Everythings ComingUp Roses, 
and Roses Turn. The shows 
original Jerome Robbins choreog
raphy (some of which can cur
rently be seen in New York as 
part of Jerome Robbins3 Broad
way!) has been recreated by cho
reographer Bonnie Walker.
Director Arthur Laurents wrote 
the book for the musical, which 
first opened on Broadway in 1959. 
Laurents is the award-winning 
author or director of West Side 
Story, Anyone Can Whistle, Do I 
Hear a Waltz, Hallelujah, Baby!, 
I Can Get It For You Wholesale, 
and La Cage Aux Folles.

Exhibit of 
paintings 
showing in 
CFA gallery
PITTSBURGH  Carnegie 
Mellon Universitys Hewlett 
Gallery presents an exhibi
tion of paintings on paper by 
Joann Maier, through Sep
tember 23. The Hewlett Gal
lery is located on the first 
floor of the College of Fine 
Arts.
Carnegie Mellon Professor 
of Art Maier belongs to the 
generation of artists who 
were strongly influenced by 
Abstract Expressionism and 
Minimalism as well as the 
prescriptions of post-modern
ist theories, said Elaine A 
King, director of the Hewlett 
Gallery and the Carnegie 
Mellon Art Gallery.
Maier created the paint
ings on display between 1975- 
83. The artist describes the 
works as structural and color 
explorations in which she 
aspired to push her parame
ters farther.
Although many of these 
works appear subdued in 
tone, the resulting colors are 
immensely rich. Her integra
tion of color with line breaks 
down the barriers of fore
ground and background, 
noted King. Lyrical abstrac
tion melds with a brooding 
mystery evocative of the 
magical density found in a 
lush forest landscape. Col
lectively, the works demon
strate an ease and openness 
while all the elements play 
off of each other in these 
complexly-woven abstract 
compositions.
Maier received her under
graduate art training at Car
negie Mellon, where she fo

The Bad Brains are coming 
back, finally.
After three years, the Bad 
Brains are returning to Pitts
burgh. Their last show in the area 
was in 1986 in the Skibo Ball
room, a somewhat impromptu 
show set up by WRCT. H.R., the 
lead singer, was busted for mari
juana possession not long after
wards, and the band broke up for 
a while. While H.R. did solo work, 
the rest of the band eventually 
drifted back together and recorded 
a new album with a new singer. 
H.R. returned, the new vocalist 
left, H.R. rerecorded the albums 
vocal tracks, and the album should 
be out this week.
The band has already started 
touring in support of the album, 
with a good bit of success. Shows 
in New York (the bands present 
home) and Washington D.C. (the 
bands first home) sold out quickly. 
The D.C. shows attendance was 
probably helped immensely by the 
fact that Fugazi, the latest band
wu4Id en%vM en%vM 
t1 
dk9vkP
with Ian MacKaye in it, opened 
for the Bad Brains. Fugazi has 
been able to sell out thousandperson halls all by their lonesome, 
so their addition to the B ad Brains 
bill just ensured a sold-out show 
all the more. Unlike those two 
shows, however, the Pittsburgh 
show is part of the official tour, so 
Leeway, a New York hardcore/ 
thrash metal (i.e., speed metal 
with short hair) band, will be 
opening. They arent quite in 
Fugazis class, but they are good 
enough not to miss. (The bad part 
about Leeway opening is the fact 
that it shows that the Bad Brains 
are now a metal band. At least 
thats what their record label 
would like everyone to think, since 
metal makes more moola.)
The best part of the show is the
fact that its at 
Graffiti  Im not 
sure how the nor
mal, upscale clien
tele will react to 
hordes of punks, 
but it should be 
interesting to 
watch. The show is 
next Monday (September 18) and 
should get started around 8:30. 
(Graffiti is at 4615 Baum Boule
vard. Walk up Morewood until 
you get to Baum and make a left. 
Graffiti is on the right. Its a long 
walk, so hope for no rain.)
In any case, there are some rec
ords you need. Half Life, Pitts
burghs punk rock institution, 
finally put out a full LP this 
summer. Its callediVeuer Give In, 
it has all the Half Life classics 
like Somethings Missing, its 
already in its second pressing, its 
good, and you need it. With only 
one original member left, Half 
Lifes tone has moved even closer 
to metal, but it works. (Inciden
tally, the band also has two seveninchers out. The first one, Under The Knife, is hard to find; the
second one, I Got It Bad, is still 
around, and you need them both, 
too.)
The Cynics have new vinyl out, 
a seven inch for Get My Way, a 
song from their impending album.
Its probably one of their best 
songs ever, and if the rest of the 
album is this good, well...Dan Bidwa is a senior professional writing major and the music director of WRCT.

If*. Once we found out Ugly-on-a- Stick was pregnant, people 
. started being nice to her. You
know, Chloris, I told her, using
- her Christian name, Chloris, of
 all the ugly people I know, youre 
^not as ugly as some.
Thank you, Joe Bob. 
-Compliments mean a lot to
 woman, even if she does look like
 a pool cue with legs.
One day Ugly asked me to take 
her to the doctor to get her babymaking equipment checked out, 
and when she came out, she looked
 like somebodyd run over her face
 with an International Harvester 
: wheat combine. Of course, her 
:face normally looks like some
body bulldozed it with a Panzer 
tank division, so this was an 
improvement.
Youre just radiant ever since 
. you got pregnant, I told her.
Joe Bob, theyre saying this 
. pregnancy could stretch me all
- out of shape.
Yeah, I know that. It makes 
your stomach get all these lumps 
in it like a burlap bag, but what
 well do is go down to the video 
 store and check out Jane Fondas
Ugly-and-Pregnant Workout, and 
pretty soon...
 Thats not what I mean. The 
doctor says that, since I only weigh 
38 pounds, this baby could come 
I out one-fourth the weight of my 
own self.
So what?
So I could get babied to death. 
Ive got the mutant cockroach from 
Alien inside there.
K I dont think its gonna be that 
good-looking, but I see what you
j Joe Bob Goes ! To The Drive-In !
mean. What well do is some 
Caesarean liposuction, jerk the 
little booger out of there, sew you 
back up, and before you know it 
youll have a bouncing baby 
human-like creature foraging 
through the house.
But he says Ive got to quit 
cigarettes, alcohol, and any other 
narcotic.
Any other narcotic? Did you 
tell him how'ugly you are? That 
theres not much you can do to 
help that baby?
He says that the reason Ive 
been throwing up three times a 
day is that Im not following the 
right diet for being pregnant. I 
thought it was morning sickness, 
but he says, no, its just drinking 
too much Corona.
Ive never heard that. I dont 
think thats in any of the baby 
books about cutting down on 
Corona.
I asked him if I could limit 
myself to three six-packs a day... 
God! How could anybody live 
on that?
... but he says Ive got to go cold 
turkey.
Well get you into Raleigh Hills. 
Who do you wanna accuse of being 
the father so we can convince him 
to pay for it?
Well, the Gonzalez brothers 
never have had any money. Bet
ter go with Jimmy 
Bohannon.
Does Jimmy 
Bohannon have 
money?
No, but hell find 
some just to keep 
" " w * ~ * people from finding 
out he had sex with me. 
Somebody had actual sex with 
you?
How do you think I got preg
nant?
I know, I know. I guess it was 
just something I blocked out of 
my mind until now. Dont men
tion that part of it again, okay? 
Im willing to help you out with 
this, but there are some things a 
man just cant stand to think 
about.
Okay, Joe Bob, I wont men
tion knowing Jimmy Bohannon 
in a Biblical sense.
Thank you, Ug.
After all, she said, Im 
damned ugly.
Yes you are.
Youre the only one who under
stands me, Joe Bob.
Speaking of people with 
enormous self-respect, A Man 
Called Rainbo just came out  
the only Sly Rocky Rambo movie 
Id never seen. In 1973 Stallone 
made a hippie flick called Rebel 
that was so bad they actually gave 
Sly words to say. Then some 
degenerates in Hollywood said, 
Hey, whats a cheap way we could 
exploit the fame of Sly Rocky 
Rambo? and so they bought the 
rights to Rebel, threw out the 
soundtrack, re-edited it, shot some 
insert footage, hired some voices

Last week students were 
I treated to a performance by Jerry 
i; Mayer inyou know Al he's a funny 
j.guy> a one-man show based on the 
;life and work of Albert Einstein.
: Students in CIT and MCS saw 
the first two performances in the 
Kresge Theater, while general 
admission for all students was 
available for the remaining three 
1 performances.
Mayer, who wrote the play, 
takes the scientist who revolu
tionized physics out of the closet 
and brings him to life by showing 
us his love for science, piano playf ing, drip coffee, and cookies.
The play unfolds in 1953 inside 
a classroom at the Institute for 
Advanced Studies in Princeton. 
Scrawling a series of equations in 
thin air, Al comes across a mean 
) one and exclaims, Youre an ugly
equation! and in turn sits down 
to play boogie woogie on the piano 
to relieve his tensions.
After seeing the error in his 
calculations and getting up to 
correct his equation, he realizes 
that he is not alone and that we, 
his students or audience, are there 
with him. Quickly he composes 
himself and starts his lecture 
about relativity, time, space, and 
life in general.
Mayer, who wrote and per
formed this one-man show, has 
also appeared in numerous other 
plays and films. Some of his cred
its include Much Ado About 
Nothing, Play Memory, Cyrano, 
Alice in Wonderland, and Two 
Gentlemen of Verona.
Mayer manages to bring the 
character of Einstein out of the 
scientific shell we see him in and 
show the lighter side of this gentle 
genius. He continues on the as
pects of theoretical physics, but
P""3"M5

Hes young, hes vocal, hes not carrying any anti-tank weapons: its Sly Stallone in A Man Called Rainbo
to do a whole new script, and 
created a story about how Sly 
infiltrates a hippie terrorist group 
by promising hell help start World 
War III. Slys plan: hell take a 
box full of dog doo-doo to the 
Russian ambassadors porch and 
set it on fire. Unfortunately, Sly 
suffered brain damage when he 
listened to an Alvin and the Chip
munks record 39 times in a row, 
backwards, and now everywhere 
he goes in his groovy platform 
shoes, he steps in dog doo-doo 
himself, ruining the chance to 
make love to the rich hippie girl; 
with long straight hair who makes 
porno jewelry. Meanwhile, Rich
ard Nixon has sent a robot dis
guised as a black revolutionary to 
infiltrate Slys hippie terrorist 
group, but Sly is too busy doing
the Hokey Pokey with a topless 
blonde porker to notice.
In other words, a whole lot of 
plot getting in the way of the 
story. They went for a Woody Allen 
deal, like Whats Up, Tiger Lily? 
but its more like Whats Up, Doc? 
but without the subtlety. The best 
parts are watching Sly go though 
the full range of emotions: dead
pan, deadpan with raised eye
brow, deadpan with quivering lip. 
Theres also a great sequence 
where Sly drives his VW Beetle 
down the interstate for about 20 
minutes, staring dramatically 
through the windshield.
Two breasts, sort of. One motor 
vehicle chase, sort of. One car 
crash, sort of. Bra burning. Shoesniffing. Microwaved Pillsbury

slowly starts to fade in and out of 
the structure of his lecture. He 
starts to reminisce about his days 
with Charlie Chaplin, tells us 
jokes, reads us some of his mail, 
and explains why he doesnt wear 
socks. He even brews up a pot of 
coffee right there on the stage and 
invites us all to have a cup with 
him at intermission.
Towards the end, Mayer takes 
on the darker side of science and 
the quest for understanding. 
Changing character momentar
ily and becoming an accuser, he 
states, All you did was ask the 
simple question, What is light, 
anyway? and 40 years later they 
started to blow up the world.
But life continues and time 
moves on. Winding the lecture 
up, he turns to the piano and 
plays some Bach, leaving us with 
an Einstein who is a scientist to 
the core, but a human being first 
and foremost.

John tours USA supporting Sleeping With the Past
Diversions Staff Meeting 
9 tonight  Tartan Office
Some things are worth waiting for.
By MICHAEL SCHWARTZ
Tartan Staffwriter
Gone are the flamboyant jack
ets and hats of his earlier years. 
No more glasses that glitter and 
glow. Elton John, bom Reginald 
Kenneth Dwight of Middlesex, 
England, has a new image, but 
hes holding on to the sound that 
has made him a star.
Fans of Elton John will have 
the opportunity to see him live in 
concert as his latest concert tour, 
Elton John  The World Tour 
1989-90 pulls into Pittsburgh 
next Tuesday at the Civic Arena.
John will be promoting his new 
album, Sleeping With the Past, 
which marks the 29th album in a 
musical career that spans three 
decades. At age 42, John has 
written and performed one or 
more hit singles every year since
I think %teecI2g #I!k !ke i4! is the 
strongest record weve ever made. 
We went back to out roots and tried 
to do something special, and I feel we 
succeeded
9 Elton John
arriving on the music scene in 
1970, a feat unmatched by any 
other artist.
The Sleeping With the Past 
concert is a two hour and fortyfive minute show that runs from 
many of the earlier hits like 
Rocket Man, Tiny Dancer, and 
Dont Let the Sun Go Down on 
Me to newer songs like I Guess 
That6 Why They Call it the
Blues, Sad Songs (Say So 
Much), and I Dont Wanna Go 
On With You Like That. Also 
featured will be five or six tracks 
from the new album.
His previous album, Reg Strikes 
Back, did well, spawning a num
ber 2 single (I Dont Wanna Go 
On With You Like That) and the 
hit A Word in Spanish. In 
producing Sleeping With the Past
John once again teams up with 
long-time collaborator Bernie 
Taupin. As John describes their 
work, I think Sleeping With the 
Past is the strongest record weve 
ever made. We went back to out 
roots and tried to do something' 
special, and I feel we succeeded.
Sleeping With the Past was re
leased on the MCA label on Au
gust 29. The lead-off single, 
Healing Hands, is already re
ceiving heavy airplay on local 
radio stations and MTV. The 
enthusiasm generated into put
ting this album and tour together 
have produced what may quite 
well be one of Elton Johns great
est albums to date.
Tickets are on sale now. Elton 
John  TJie World Tour 1989-90 
will be coming to the Civic Arena 
on September 19. Itll be a show

Koyannisqatsi
Director Godfrey Reggio originally released this visual 
symphony of modem existence as a silent pice, but it 
failed to attract public or critical attention, lie did what 
any self-respecting art film director would do; he punted, 
and approached minimalist composer Philip Glass about 
writing a score for the film. The combination is a musical 
and cinematic knockout thats hypnotic and profound. The 
title is a Hopi word meaning life out of balance, and thats 
exactly what the film shows us, in stunning time-lapse 
sequences and intricate slow-motion coordinated by cine
matographer Ron Fricke. Sit near the center of the hall for 
the best sound; it may be shown in stereo.

Repo Man
Remember when Emilio Estevez was Martin Sheens 
famous son, before Platoon came out? The Breakfast Club 
aside, this is the movie that gave him that title. Repo Man 
is about punk teenagers in Los Angeles ... well, actually 
its about auto repossession ... well, truthfully its about 
aliens from outer space and a Buick ... well, youre just 
going to have to see it and find out. Estevez plays a punk 
hired by an old hand repo man (Harry Dean Stanton) to be 
the new guy on the team. Telling you too much more about 
the plot would spoil the fun, but the movie is sophisticated, 
offbeat, and just a bit raw.

Dirty Rotten Scoundrels
Steve Martin and Michael Caine star in this box office 
hit comedy set on the French Riviera. Both play despicable 
con men with a penchant for rich, weak-minded women; 
Caine is the suave European and Martin is the unsubtle 
American. Since there arent enough widows and heir
esses to go around, the two strike a bet of sorts, where the 
first man to fleece a specific target gets to keep the 
territory; the other promises to depart.
Martin and Caine are both wonderfully nasty, the kind 
of men who would sell their mothers if the offer were good. 
There are some truly hysterical scenes, including Caines 
visit to a local jail to bail Martin out; unfortunately, the 
wonderful shot seen in the films TV advertisements where 
the two stroll along the docks doing mischief (Caine pushes 
an elderly woman into the drink while Martin shoves 
dessert in a boys face) is not seen in the film. Despite that, 
its worth seeing, especially at $1 a person.

Everything You Always Wanted To 
Know About Sex 
(But Were Afraid To Ask)
The Sunday AB Woody Allen film series continues 
with one of Allens less conventional films. Supposedly 
based on the 60s book of the same name, Everything You 
Always Wanted To Know... is composed of vignettes that 
address questions posed in the book. Allen himself ap
pears relatively rarely in the movie, but he does bring the 
house down in the end by playing a weak-kneed sperm who 
doesnt want to be ejaculated. (Really, who does?) Other 
stars include Tony Randall, Burt Reynolds, and the bril
liant Gene Wilder. Aside from its clear educational value, 
Everything You Always Wanted To Know... is good clean 
fun, and good Allen filmmaking.

They're Hot, 
They're Wild, 
They're On Sale.
If you plan on writing, presenting, 
publishing, drawing or designing, 
MacWriteII and MacDrawII software 
from Claris is the hottest and wildest 
combination available for your Mac.
MacWrite II is the hottest word 
processor around with footnotes or 
endnotes, a lightning-fast 100,000-word 
spelling checker, a 220,000-synonym 
thesaurus, multiple columns, headers 
and footers.
It also has word counting so you 
dont go one word over on that 1,000- 
word paper thats due first thing in the 
morning. And for those foreign language 
studies, optional international spelling 
dictionaries make your assignments a 
little less foreign.
Now lets talk wild. MacDraw II is 
outrageous. You can use it with virtually 
any course youre taking. Make over
head slides for a class presentation, or
create structural drawings or architec
tural designs for those engineering or 
interior design classes even news
letters and flyers for student-body 
sponsored events.
Its easy but precise. Zoom in to 
3200%, rotate objects in .1 increments, 
measure down to millimeters, even 
do dimensioning.
Put hot and wild together and things 
get really exciting. You can insert your 
MacDraw II drawings into MacWrite II. 
And even reduce, enlarge and crop 
them once theyre there.
Your campus has worked out a 
special deal for you. It wont last 
forever. Get hot. Get wild. Get 
MacWrite II and 
MacDraw II now.
Theyre on sale.CLARIS
