Mark Stehlik, acting director of the Intro
duction to Programming Group in the Com
puter Science Department, confirmed that 
changes are being made to the 15-1 lx courses. 
Stehlik is acting director while Phil Miller is 
on sabbatical.
Stehlik announced the following changes:
The 15-118 class, usually for H&SS stu
dents, will receive the biggest changes. It will 
absorb H&SS students who intend to con
tinue with their programming in 15-200, and 
MCS and CIT students (who would be taking 
15-111), who have no plans for furthering 
their Pascal training by taking 15-211.
The new 15-118 course will be beefed up 
somewhat more than the original class. 
Mathematical concepts will be elaborated 
upon and efficiency will be increasingly 
stressed, and the course will go deeper into 
algorithm analysis. Matrices and 2-dimen
sional arrays will be introduced, but linked 
lists will not be included.
A new class will be created for H&SS 
students who dont want to go beyond the 
introductory class. This new class will still 
contain the basic elements of Pascal pro
gramming, but will also include an introduc
tion to spreadsheets and databases for more 
practicality.
Those MCS and CIT students who intend 
to go from 15-111 to 15-211 will experience 
few changes. The group discussing the 
changes may revise the syllabus in order to go 
deeper into computer science concepts, but 
the standard ingredients will remain the 
same.
The 15-116 course for architecture stu
dents will not undergo further significant 
changes.
The changes are being made because the 
current curriculum wasnt considered practiphoto by Dan Giurca 
An "Intro to Programming student wrestles 
with a Pascal program recently. Major 
changes are planned for the courses.
cal for those students who dont intend to 
continue with their programming after the 
initial introductory course. Additionally, 
for those students who do want to further 
their Pascal training, questions were raised 
concerning the issue of whether the exist
ing courses were meeting the students 
needs.
Stehlik stated that the amount of time 
the courses take may be a little more, but he 
doesnt think it will make a significant 
impact. He stressed that it was up to you 
to determine when youre done with the 
process (of programming), and that there 
are a lot of pieces to be put together until 
youre ready to say its finished. 
I think that linked lists are an awful lot 
to learn and the changes are a good idea. 
But Im also glad I did learn linked lists and 
all that because I-enjoyed the class and 
never know when Ill need that knowledge, 
said Mary Smith, a CIT sophomore who 
took 15-111 but didnt go on to 15-211.
I think the changes are very good, said 
H&SS sophomore Rich Engel, a current 15- 
118 student. It sounds like theyre finally 
getting their heads on straight.
The revised courses will be implemented 
in the fall semester of 1989.

Gas leak forces evacuations
By ANDY GILLESPIE
Tartan Contributing Editor
Scaife, Baker, and Porter Halls were 
evacuated because of a natural gas leak 
Wednesday at 9:55 am. Campus Police 
Officer Jerry James noticed the strong 
odor while on routine patrol by the main 
entrance of Porter Hall.
The safety of the people in the build
ings was our number one concern, stated 
Sgt. Bill Ricci of Campus Police as he 
explained that the officers went through 
the buildings and told everybody to leave. 
During a gas leak, you dont want to 
change the state of any electrical equip
ment, so we did not want to activate the 
fire alarm system. Frew Street was 
blocked off to keep vehicles clear.
Pittsburgh Fire Companies and 
Peoples Gas Company representatives
responded quickly to the leak. CMU 
Environmental Safety workers, using 
meters to detect gas levels, were able to 
rule out a leak inside any of the build
ings. Therefore, they were not sealed off 
as well as they could have been.
Campus Police could have done abetter 
job keeping people out. It wasnt until I 
was inside Porter Hall that anybody told 
me that I wasnt allowed in, said sopho
more Mike Woodring.
When told that a few people did go back 
inside before the all clear signal was 
given, Ricci responded, Ifthere had been 
an actual leak inside a building, we would 
have locked the doors and posted signs.
The gas was leaking from an old 16- 
inch main gas line behind Scaife Hall, in 
Panther Hollow. Peoples Gas Company 
shut off the line by 10:35 am and declared 
the buildings safe to enter at that time.

University Center postponed indefinitely
Administration cites lack of donors for the $30 million project
By JOSH RUBEN
Tartan Editorial Assistant
Construction of the new Uni
versity Center, one of the central 
features of the master plan, has 
been indefinitely delayed due to a 
lack of funds for the building in 
the Capital Campaign. 
Paradoxically, however, the 
Capital Campaign itself is doing 
well.
President Richard Cyert admits 
that the main problem is that 
most of the donors who are giving 
to the Campaign are earmarking 
their money for other projects. 
Specifically, new professorships 
and other educational grants are 
the primary interests  not new 
construction.
The postponement of the Uni
versity Center comes almost three 
semesters after the release of the 
Task Force Report on the Quality 
of Student Life on November 24, 
1987.
Construction of the proposed 
University Center should com
mence at the earliest possible 
time. The notion of the Center ... 
is one that has been embraced 
almost universally by the campus 
community, the report said. Not 
only are expectations high, but 
the protraction of this project will 
have a chilling effect on all other 
steps ... that are taken to enable 
Carnegie Mellon to reflect the 
virtually limitless potential of its 
constituency.

Andy Robitshek emphasized the 
importance of; the University 
Center for students. The Univer
sity Center is the number one 
concern for students, he said.
The problem with fundraising 
for the University Center persists. 
There has been no great support 
for the University Center, said
Vice President for Development 
Alvin Brannick about the dona
tions.
Cyert agreed. The University 
Center does not have strong ap
peal. That doesnt bother me; we 
still have to keep hammering 
away.
According to Brannick, the
Capital Campaign is currently 
moving ahead of schedule. Were 
past the midway mark in the 
Campaign, at about $ 130 million, 
said Brannick.
The fund raisers goal, accord
ing to Brannick, has been to get a 
prospect interested in giving 
money, and then narrow the fo
cus to a specific project. He em
phasized that the University 
Center is a top priority when talk
ing to the donors.
Robitshek disagreed, however. 
They say that they need a major 
donor for the University Center, 
he said, but they have not tar
geted for a major donor. It has not 
been an emphasis.

However, regardless of whether alcohol is served

Carnegie Mellon in Brief
Eirene holds dance, faces arrest
SEI protestor Vincent Eirene held an unsanctioned dance, as 
promised, in Grey Matter on Valentines Day.
 '  Eirene and his associate, Kevin Forsythe, have been subject to 
re-arrest since February 10 for refusing to pay the fines they 
incurred by chaining closed the doors of the Software Engineer
ing Institute (SEI) in December.
Eirene and Forsythe are affiliated with Duncan and Porter 
House, an organization on the North Side that provides shelter 
and support for the homeless. Eirene stated that they would face 
re-arrest at the dance after going underground over the 
weekend. However, no police were present during the course of
 the dance, and neither of the two were arrested. Eirene, in a tele
phone interview Sunday, told The Tartan that he had not yet 
been arrested.
Billed as a celebration of love and resistance, the dance was 
attended by about thirty of Eirenes supporters and CMU stu
dents.
Adamson wing donor passes away
Clarence H. Adamson, who presented the Adamson Wing in 
Baker Hall to the University in 1983 in memory of his wife, 
Pauline, died in his sleep Thursday, at the age of 95. Adamson, 
a 1915 alumnus, donated the Pauline B. Adamson Wing to the 
Department of English because of his wifes strong interest in the 
English language and in American literature.
' jHe also established the Pauline Adamson Writing Awards in
 the English Department. In all, Adamson gave almost $9 million 
in gifts to the University.
In a 1987 letter to Adamson, President Cyert called him a man 
o vision in recognizing the all-important need to educate our 
young people and to provide them with the necessary tools to be 
productive members of todays fast-paced world.
Fenton & Morgan win Doherty Prize
Carnegie Mellon faculty members Edwin Fenton and M. 
Granger Morgan have been named as the first recipients of the 
Robert Doherty Prize to honor substantial and sustained contri
butions to excellence in education.
Both will be presented with the award at the University 
Teaching Awards Ceremony to be held on Tuesday, May 2.
In a memo announcing the winners, President Cyert said, 
Carnegie Mellon would not be the same institution without the 
Vision and activities of these two educational leaders.
1989 honorary degree awards finalized
' The Board of Trustees has given final apporval for three hon
orary degrees to be granted at Commencement in May. Dr. Raoul 
-Bott, Dr. Emilio Rosenblueth, and Dr. George E. P. Box have been 
-named as the recipients for 1989.
Dr. Bott, the William Caspar Graustein Professor of Mathe
matics at Harvard University, is an alumnus of CMU. He 
received the National Medal of Science Award in 1987 for his 
pioneering studies in geometry and topology. Dr. Rosenblueth, 
Coordinator of Scientific Research for the Institute of Engineer-ing at the National University of Mexico, is one of the outstand
ing earthquake engineers in the world. Dr. Box, the Vials Re
search Professor of Statistics at the University of Wisconsin, is 
widely recognized as one of the leading developers of statistical 
science and its application to science and engineering.

Bomb in a tape 
recorder caused 
plane crash
LOCKERBIE, Scotland (AP)-. 
The bomb that blasted Pan Am 
Flight 103 out of the skies over 
Scotland on December 21 was 
planted in a radio-cassette player 
and was probably loaded aboard 
the plane in Frankfurt, the detec
tive heading the international in
vestigation said Thursday.
Detective Chief Superinten
dent John Orr said it was not 
certain the bomb was put aboard 
in Frankfurt.
But answering questions, he 
said the balance of probabilities 
pointed to Frankfurt, where the 
flight originated, rather than 
London, where it took on new 
passengers and changed to a 
Boeing 747.
The particular baggage which 
contained the device has not been 
identified at this stage, but there 
is the most detailed work under 
way, with forensic assistance, to
achieve this identification, he 
said.
Orr said the baggage container 
had been reconstructed from 
pieces scattered over 40 miles of 
hills, forests and pasture east of 
Lockerbie, the Scottish town that 
bore the brunt of the flaming 
wreckage.
While not spelling out why he 
believed the bomb was planted in 
Frankfurt, he said: The recon
struction ofthe baggage container 
suggests that the explosive de
vice may have been among the 
baggage from the Frankfurt 
flight.
He said the container was filled 
mostly with baggage from Frank
furt and a small amount of inter
line baggage from connecting 
flights.
Europe wants 
nuclear weapons
SHANNON, Ireland (AP)  
Secretary of State James Baker 
said at the end of a trip to the 15 
NATO allies that none of them 
wants to see Western Europe
stripped of battlefield nuclear 
weapons.
Baker also said reports of a rift 
with West Germany over upgrad
ing Lance battlefield missiles to 
extend their range, were inaccu
rate. He said he expected the is
sue to be resolved at a summit 
meeting of the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization in Brussels 
in May.
But Baker, in talking to report
ers aboard his Air Force jet, did 
not claim to have persuaded West 
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl 
to drop his demand for a delay of 
two or three years in modernizing 
the missiles. A senior U.S. offi
cial, who requested anonymity, 
said Baker understood the politi
cal problems in West Germany 
over the question.
On another issue, the senior 
U.S. official who requested ano
nymity said U.S. weapons ship
ments to Moslem guerrillas in 
Afghanistan would be continued 
even if the Soviet Union ceased 
its support for the beleaguered 
Kabul regime. The assertion by 
the U.S. official on Bakers plane
appears to commit the Bus 
administration to an importari 
role in the guerrillas drive ti 
topple the Kabul regime.

NATIONAL NEWS
Agencies plagued 
by contract fraud
NEW YORK (D J)  Federal in
vestigators say individual sure
ties, people who provide financial 
bonds to guarantee performance 
by government contractors, are 
the grist for a nationwide fraud 
that may be costing the govern
ment and small businesses tens 
of millions of dollars.
In the past few years, providing 
such bonds has become an in
creasingly popular business for 
an array of legitimate entrepre
neurs  and also for convicted 
felons, suspected stock swindlers, 
defrocked lawyers and others who 
profess to have enormous wealth 
but, when it comes time to make 
good on a claim, dont pay up.
The Federal Bureau of Investi
gation and several other govern
ment agencies are conducting 
criminal probes, and a number of 
people have already been indicted.
T,o qualify as a surety, a person 
must submit a statement of net 
worth, certified by a supposedly 
knowledgeable and independent 
party, such as a bank official. Fees
for individual sureties run as high 
as 7% of the contract amount, 
several times the rate charged by 
corporate sureties. And contrac
tors pass along such extra costs to 
the government.
The debate over individual 
sureties is especially troubling for 
minority-owned businesses. 
Ralph Thomas, executive direc
tor of the National Association of 
Minority Contractors, estimates 
that without individual sureties, 
75% of the minority-group con
tractors doing business with the 
federal government would be 
forced to stop.
Environmental 
crimes punished
NEW YORK (D J)  A growing 
number of corporations  and 
their managers  have felt the 
sting of the federal governments 
stepped-up criminal environ
mental enforcement efforts. High 
and Pennwalt have both pleaded 
not guilty. Ashland Oil Co. was 
indicted on two misdemeanor 
counts in January 1988 following 
the collapse of one of its fuel tanks
in Jefferson Borough, Pa.
Corporations have had to com
ply with civil environmental laws 
for years, but criminal cases were 
rare until the Justice Department 
established a special environmental-crimes section in 1982. 
While only 25 such cases were 
prosecuted by the federal govern
ment during the 1970s, there have 
been 468 indictments since 1982 
and the Justice Department ex
pects to bring even more cases to 
trial. It is asking for additional 
financing for litigation expenses 
and for the addition of eight attor
neys to the 20 currently working 
for the environmental crimes 
section.
Among the companies that have 
been indicted on environmental 
charges:
 Texaco Inc., which pleaded 
guilty in federal court in Los 
Angeles.
 Nabisco Brands Inc., now RJR 
Nabisco Inc., which pleaded guilty 
in federal court in Tacoma to

The furor surrounding the Stuent Presidential Search Com
mittee has finally died down, and 
D student representatives met 
ast week to begin their role in the 
election process.
At the first official meeting of 
he Committee, held Thursday 
fternoon, ten undergraduates 
iet with the nine graduate stuents chosen by the Graduate 
tudent Organization (GSO). 
tudents were culled from each of 
ie colleges and a number of stuent organizations to ensure a 
epresentative cross-section of the 
tudent body.
The undergraduates representig the five colleges were chosen 
t the 2/7 Senate meeting. Foliwingthe terms of a compromise 
esolution between Senate and 
tudent Government President 
jidy Robitshek, Robitshek made 
(he final selection of members 
rom a list approved by Senate. 
Of the 22 students who attended 
hat meeting in hopes of gaining a 
eat on the committee, five were 
hosen. They are: Ingrid Bromberg 
!FA); Carlos Franco (IM); Marc 
ioston (H&SS); Kimberly
McGraw (MCS); and Kishore Rao 
(CIT). McGraw was elected Act
ing Chair at last weeks meeting. 
The student organization repre
sentatives, appointed by the 
groups they represent, are: Trina 
Pundurs (GALA); Keisha Watson 
(Spirit); Debbie Sinn (Panhel); 
Doug Cervenak (CFP); and Bryan 
Wong (SDC).
Graduate students appointed 
to the committee are: Tom 
Marchok and Tamal Mukherjee 
(CIT); Robert Masterson (H&SS); 
Scott Gordon (MCS); Steven 
Polozie and Carol Goldburg 
(GSIA); Saranna Robinson 
(SUPA); and Karl Kluge and Will 
Welsh (CS). McGraw isnt aware 
of any CFA graduate students on 
the committee, because none 
showed up at Thursdays meet
ing.
Although CIT, GSIA, and CS 
have two representatives each, 
they will be allowed only one vote. 
GSO had originally appointed four 
members, one each from CIT, 
MCS, SUPA and CS; this changed 
when Senate ordered the restruc
turing of the undergraduate se
lections.
Scott Gordon, MCS representa
tive and president of GSO, said 
that additional grad students

were chosen on a first-come, firstserved basis with GSO reps an
nouncing the additional openings 
to their colleges. Gordon admit
ted that he would have preferred 
to see the number of grad stu
dents decrease after the restruc
turing; however, he is satisfied 
with the current numbers. And 
although he understands the 
desire to represent everyone, he 
believes that no matter who you 
appoint, youre not going to get a 
fair representation, because of 
personal biases.
According to Gordon, the addi
tional representatives will be used 
as alternatives because Its a lot 
harder for grad students to make 
meetings. This way, theres al
ways someone to go.
McGraw said she was elected 
acting chair because none of the 
committee members really knew 
each other. She will retain her 
position until the committees first 
draft of recommendations, called 
the White Paper, is presented 
to the faculty search committee. 
Targeted completion date of the 
White Paper is roughly a month, 
after which a new chair will most 
likely be chosen.
The White Paper must be fin
ished in time for the Trustees 
Steering Committee meeting, to 
be held in late March or early 
April. This is the committee that 
will make the actual selection of 
the new president.
Despite their unfamiliarity with 
each other, McGraw is optimistic 
about the group. Everyone seems 
very excited about the job they 
have to do. Im sure everyone will 
work well together.
Robitshek echoed McGraws 
sentiment, calling the group very 
diverse and saying that he felt 
they represented a wide range of 
student needs and desires. One 
aspect he found important was 
the fact that Some of the grad 
students were undergrads at 
CMU  theyve seen problems 
from both sides. Robitshek 
pointed out that some of the grad 
students teach as well, which 
gives them a unique perspective 
on student needs.
Gordon added that there is.;, a 
growing trend, especially among! 
smaller private institutions, to 
get broader input in the selection 
process. Trustees usually picked 
presidents according to their own 
criteria alone. Were very fortu
nate to have the opportunity to. 
contribute to this process.
While not a member of the 
committee, Robitshek will -be. 
available to members should they  
need him. He doesnt plan to at
tend all of the meetings, but will; 
try to go occasionally.
Committee meetings are open; 
to all Carnegie Mellon students.; 
Says McGraw, We have to get ; 
their ideas for what they want in ' 
a President. She also points to an  
open forum meeting at which t)ie  
group will give a formal presenta-1 
tion of their ideas and accomplishments to the student body. The : 
forum will probably be held, in j 
conjunction with President} 
Cyerts address to the students. ! 
Cyerts speech was to be given.on !; 
March 3; it has been tentatively I

National Association of Scholars speaker accuses ACLU of being political
MICHAEL EWEDOSH
'artan Staffwriter
On Monday, February 13, Proissor William Donohue spoke at 
arnegie Mellon about The Hiden Agenda of the ACLU. 
'onohue, head of the Department 
[Sociology at La Roche College, 
3 to a- group of about two 
ozen faculty, staff, and students. 
Following a reception hosted by 
le Western Pennsylvania chapjr of the National Association of 
cholars, Donohue spoke and 
elded questions for about an hour 
l Wean Hall 2325, after which 
ie discussion was continued inirmally.
Donohue began to investigate 
le ACLU as a topic for his thesis 
it New York University. I had no 
that they were such a fraud 
ntil I investigated their organiation, he said. He claims that 
is book, The Politics of The 
merican Civil Liberties Union, 
the only one of five or ten books 
ublished on that ACLU to critiilly examine the organization. 
He refuted the groups apolitical 
Status, calling them the legal arm 
jthe liberal left.
I Donohue cited specific examples 
in the ACLUs history which he 
[claims show that the ACLUs
primary goal is the promotion of 
its own leftist agenda. He indi
cated that the nation is approach
ing a state of moral destitution 
because of people who have a 
fetish with the freedoms of indi
viduals.
Donohue claimed that the 
ACLU is the most committed 
defender of pornography in the 
country. He cited a fundraiser for 
the San Francisco chapter at 
which, according to Donohue, two 
sexually explicit films, Behind the 
GreenDoor and Deep Throat, were 
shown. Donohue, who claims that 
the ACLU receives part of its 
funding from the Playboy Foun
dation, said that in 1982 the 
ACLU supported child pornogra
phy as freedom of speech.
GSIA professor Thomas Kerr 
was head of the Pennsylvania 
chapter of the ACLU between 
1964 and 1984. He clarifies that, 
in the case Donohue was refer
ring to, the crime was in the abuse 
of the children, and that the pho
tographer should be convicted for 
that. He said that placing the 
photos in a publication was a 
completely separate issue.
Donohue raised questions about 
how a group that claimed to sup
port the freedoms and rights of 
individuals could support affirma
tive action.
Kerr, who is in the Graduate 
School of Industrial Administra
tion, said that the ACLU was 
supportive of those legal meas
ures that try to guarantee the 
right of the individual to obtain 
employment without being dis
criminated against on the basis of 
race, religion, sexual preference, 
gender, age, or physical handi
cap.
Donohue illustrated examples 
in the history of the ACLU that he 
claims show that it is not truly 
apolitical, but instead revolution
ary in nature. He cited the report
ing of names of suspected com
munists to the FBI in the 1950s, 
the fact that the ACLU was at 
first opposed to the Wagner Act 
(which legalized unions and raised 
issues of binding arbitration and 
collective bargaining) and was one 
of the last organizations to change 
its position on the matter.
Donohue cites another instance 
in which the ACLU said that the 
Roman Catholic Church was in
fluencing the opinion of an anti
abortion congressman. He said 
that the ACLU had one of its 
attorneys follow the congressman 
to church on some Sundays and 
that the same attorney examined, 
with the congressmans permis
sion, his mail. The attorney 
counted the occurrences of the 
phrase God bless you in the 
congressmans mail to support the 
ACLUs assertion. Another posi
tion that Donohue said the ACLU 
supports was that people should 
have the right to be big brothers 
and sisters or foster parents re
gardless of their sexual prefer
ence.
Kerr responds that the ACLU 
agrees with that right. Kerr said 
that the purpose of the ACLU was 
to protect personal liberties, hard 
won in history, periodically lost 
again and again. He said that 
those freedoms include the free
dom to worship or not to worship, 
freedom of the press, freedom of 
assembly, and the right of due 
process for those members of 
society who stand accused.
Kerr cited cases fought by the 
ACLU that he felt demonstrated 
that the organization was not the 
revolutionary group that Donohue 
alleged it to be. He mentioned 
cases which he was familiar with 
that involved the draft for the 
Vietnam War. The ACLU fought
in those cases so that draft boards 
had to give reasons to reject claims 
of conscientious objection, and so 
that young men who would other
wise be charged with felonies 
would receive due process.
Kerr also noted a case in which 
the ACLU defended the religious 
practices of a tribe of native 
Americans who used peyote, a 
form of marijuana, in what was a 
religious observance that had 
gone on for centuries and which 
brought no harm to anyone.
He described a case that the 
local chapter supported that was 
brought by the City of Pittsburgh 
against The Pittsburgh Press in 
the 1970s. Before that case, all 
newspapers had separate classi
fied help wanted ads for men 
and women. A key witness in the 
case was a member of CMUs 
Psychology Department who con
ducted a five-year analysis on the 
discriminatory effects of such 
separation. In the case, the U.S. 
Supreme Court ruled that such 
advertising was unconstitutional.
Donohue, who admits to pro
viding the Republican presiden
tial campaign and at least one ; 
campaign of a Republican Sei>a- \ 
tor who was up for reelection with j 
information about their oppo- ; 
nents, received mixed support! 
from his audience. Professor ! 
Hubert Aaronson of the Depart- ' 
ment of Metallurgical Engineer- ' 
ing and Materials Science,  
thought that Donohue gave, a ; 
quite accurate view of the ACLU. \
Two graduate students from the ' 
same department, Brett Philips \ 
and Scott Wiel, questioned the ! 
representativeness of the ex- ! 
amples cited by Donohue. They ! 
thought that the recent history - 
was rather glossed over, and j 
wondered if looking at decisions ; 
made forty and fifty years ago J 
with a modern mentality was I 
appropriate.
Matt Ruben, an H&SS sopho- ! 
more and also a student senator, I 
said that the talk would cause '> 
him to look at the ACLU muchj 
more skeptically than he had.in 
the past. He maintained that the ; 
ACLU stands up for a lot of things I 
that must be defended, a job ! 
someone must do.

The Duquesne Duke silenced by Student Government Association
continued from page 1
agreed that Drumm would speak 
for the Duke and that Klein would 
go with her as an advisor.
Drumm was questioned for an 
hour and a half about the two 
issues which SGA claimed as the 
basis for its decision to close down 
the Duke: an off-campus checking 
account at Mellon Bank and ques
tions surrounding Drumms reelection as editor-in-chief last 
March. There was little or no 
discussion given to the issue which 
the Duke editorial board believes 
led to the suspension of their 
constitution  a family planning 
ad which ran three times against 
the wishes of SGA.
' Citing a lack of cooperation on 
Drumms part, the SGA upheld 
the suspension. Duke News Edi
tor Sean McNamara later com
mented, Their definition of coop
eration is complete compliance 
with their demands.
On Tuesday, as the Duke edito
rial board began making plans to 
publish their Thursday issue offcampus, Meltzer tried to transfer 
the money from the Duke's out
side bank account to internal 
Duquesne accounts. The Pitts
burgh Post-Gazette reported that 
he obtained a check for about 
$1600 of the $1900 in the account. 
However, it is not clear whether 
the money was ever transferred 
by Mellon Bank. The SGA also 
released the Dukes mail, which it 
had been holding, after Klein 
threatened to file charges with
the post office.
Tuesday night, Carnegie Mellons Student Senate met and 
passed a strongly-worded resolu
tion condemning the actions of 
the Duquesne SGA. The resolu
tion was introduced by GSIA 
Senator Stewart Levine.
As she and the rest of the edito
rial board prepared to leave for 
Indiana University of Pennsylva
nia (IUP) at 6 pm Wednesday 
night to publish a paper in the 
offices of the IUP Penn, Drumm 
was given a letter instructing her 
to appear at an SGA meeting at 9 
pm to provide information about 
the management of the paper.
Members of the editorial board 
said they felt the letter was an 
attempt to prevent them from 
publishing off-campus. Drumm 
was quoted in The Free Press, the 
newspaper published by the Duke 
editorial board Wednesday night 
and distributed at Duquesne 
Thursday: They [SGA] gave us a 
situation that would force us to 
break either our cooperation with 
SGA or our commitment to pub
lish on Thursday.
Drumm also stated that the 
three hours between the time the 
letter was delivered and the time 
she was to have appeared before 
SGA would have been too little to 
prepare even under ordinary 
circumstances.
At its Wednesday meeting, the 
SGA Executive Board voted 
unanimously to lift the suspen
sion of the Dukes constitution,
but suspended Drumm from par
ticipation in the Duke pending 
the resolution of charges that were 
to have been filed with the uni
versitys Judicial Board yester
day.
When asked Saturday about the 
charges, SGA Senator Michael E. 
Casey replied, I can only state at 
this time that those two things 
[the outside account and Drumms 
re-election] will be included, but I 
am not exactly sure that it will be 
limited to such.
Despite early rumors that the 
Duke board had decided not to 
return without Drumm, Mc
Namara stated Sunday afternoon 
that no decision had been made 
by the board. He said that the 
board has not been officially in
formed that its constitution has 
been reactivated and may not 
make a decision about returning 
until it receives such notification.
There has been talk about the 
board leaving the Duke entirely 
and continuing to publish The Free 
Press independently. Klein said 
that even though the first edition 
of the paper was edited and laid 
out at the Penn and 4,000 copies 
were printed free of charge by the 
Washington Observer-Reporter, 
The Free Press could continue to 
publish on its own using donated 
money until at least the the end of 
the semester. Klein predicted that 
No matter what course of action, 
there will be a paper.
Meltzer said that whether or 
not the current board members
[The Student Government Associa
tion's] definition of cooperation is 
complete compliance with their de
mands. 
 Duke News Editor Sean McNamara
return, he hopes there will con
tinue to be a Duke. He said that in 
October a group of students came 
to him asking for assistance in 
starting a second Duquesne news
paper. Since then, he has been 
been helping them organize and 
find staff members. Meltzer said 
Saturday that if the current Duke 
editorial board does not come back 
he would be willing to let this 
group take over the Duke.
The primary issue in the weeklong dispute has been the SGAs 
motives in investigating the Duke. 
The SGA claims that the only 
issues involved were the check
ing account and Drumms re-elec
tion.
It is not clear how long the 
Dukes external bank account has 
existed. Most parties involved 
agree that it was opened at least 
ten years ago. According to 
Meltzer, a year and a half ago the 
account was discovered by the 
Duquesne administration, and 
last year Vice President for Uni
versity Life Sean Hogan told 
Drumm to close it and put the 
money into a university account.
Drumm acknowledges that she 
spoke with Hogan but says that 
he only asked, not ordered, her to 
move the money. She says that 
The Duke didnt feel that we 
should move the funds onto cam
pus because the university could 
have complete control of them. In 
an incident like this, where you 
want to go outside and publish, if 
the university has frozen your 
funds, you have no feasible finan
cial means.
Casey said that the SGA ob
jected to the account for two rea
sons. The first, he said, was that 
the Duke is endangering 
Duquesnes tax-exempt status. He 
said that advertising revenue is 
obtained using the Duquesne 
name and deposited in the ac
count. When commissions are 
paid to the people who sold the 
ads, they are paid from the ac
count. Casey claims that the Duke 
has failed to report the payments 
to the IRS, thus endangering 
Duquesne.
Klein conceded in The Pitts
burgh Press that tax forms have 
not been filed but said that the
payments were probably smalli 
than the amounts for which th 
forms must be filed. He also sai 
that the failure to file came froi 
ignorance of the rules, not 
attempt to mislead.
Casey said that the other SG 
objection to the account sten 
from an incident prior to Drumir 
term as editor-in-chief in whit 
Duke staff members forged tf 
former editors signature to n 
move money from the account fi 
their own purposes. Duquesi 
covered the loss. Drumm clain 
that the matter was settled wit 
the administration and the Dw 
replaced the money. Ann Ra; 
director of public relations 
Duquesne, said she was not su; 
how the situation was final P 
resolved. n(
The SGAs other charge again Pr 
the Duke was that Drumm vn P( 
re-elected to her position as eri J1 
tor-in-chief improperly last yea 
SGA members charge that si 
did not hold a meeting to det4 
mine who was eligible to vote i 
required by the Duke constitutio: 
They also claim she hired ne 
board members shortly before tl 
election and that their votf 
swung the election in her favor 
The issue is complicated by tl 
fact that the editor-in-chief oft!

The local ansie: Could it happen here?
At CMU, avoiding bad management is key to papers surviva
By JONATHAN LEVY
Tartan Contributing Editor
The main question raised for 
Carnegie Mellon students by the 
Duquesne student governments 
closing of the Duquesne Duke is: 
Could it happen here to either 
The Tartan or the Student 
Union?
Apparently, the answer is yes, 
but not very easily.
Student Senate Funding and 
Recognition Chair Frank DiVito 
explained that According to the 
fiscal policy ... the only way we 
could freeze a clubs funds  and 
this goes for any club, not just the 
newspapers  is because of bad 
management.
Although it is not clear what 
actions would constitute bad 
management, DiVito gave the 
hypothetical example of a club 
that was $ 10,000 in debt, but said 
that even in such a case Senate 
would probably attempt to use 
other measures such as a new 
budget for the organization or 
tighter supervision of the old 
budget. Referring to The Tartan 
and Student Union in particular, 
he said, I really think shutting 
down a paper would be an ex
treme step.
Others in student government 
and the administration agree that
News Analysis
shutting down either newspaper 
would require an exceptional situ
ation. Student Government Presi
dent Andy Robitshek said, I dont 
know what they would have to do. 
Probably something pretty dis
tasteful, Id think.
Associate Dean of Student Af
fairs Lois Cox said that the ad
ministration would attempt to 
negotiate a settlement with the 
newspaper before taking action 
to close it down.
Director of Student Activities 
Anne Witchner agreed. I like to 
think there is more communica
tion at CMU [than at Duquesne] 
between the administration and 
students. She also said that she 
would let students attempt to 
resolve a problem before stepping 
in herself.
The controversy at Duquesne is 
centered on three issues: a family 
planning advertisement run by 
the Duke which the Student 
Government Association (SGA) 
considered inappropriate at a 
Catholic school, an outside Duke 
checking account at Mellon Bank, 
and questions about the legiti
macy of Editor-in-Chief Rebecca 
Drumms re-election last year.
Both DiVito and Robitshek said 
that neither CMU newspaper 
would ever be shut down or har
assed because of any aspect of the 
papers content, including adver
tisements. Cox said the only ex
ceptions she would make to that 
rule would be in cases of libel or 
plagiarism. Even then, she said 
she would try to negotiate a set
tlement with the newspaper be
fore taking action to close it down.
The issue of plagiarism has 
arisen in the recent past at both 
papers. Two years ago the Stu
dent Union reprinted a New York 
Times article without permission. 
Senate froze the papers funds for 
a period of time until the Union 
obtained an agreement from the 
Times that it would not file suit.
About five years ago a Tartan 
staffwriter submitted a movie 
review under his own name that 
had appeared in a Los Angeles 
paper. After Student Affairs in
formed The Tartan of the prob
lem, the paper ran a retraction, 
gave credit to the original author, 
and dismissed the writer.
Although both newspapers said 
that they would be willing to talk 
with Student Senate about any 
ad or article that Senate objected 
to, they said that they would
decide for themselves whether or 
not to run it. Student Union staff 
member Kevin DeYager said, We 
would print any ad that did not, 
for some reason, violate a law. 
He added, however, that We look 
at everything on a case-by-case 
basis. DeYager said that edito
rial decisions are made collectively 
by the people contributing to a 
particular issue.
Tartan Editor-in-Chief Karl 
Barnhart said that The Tartan 
would very rarely reject an ad. He 
stated that the Tartans editorial 
board decides what is appropri
ate to print. We have no faculty 
advisor so we decide for ourselves 
what to run.
Unlike Duquesnes policy, out
side bank accounts are forbidden 
for Senate-funded organizations 
at Carnegie Mellon and neither 
newspaper has any known ac
counts of this type. DiVito stated 
that if a club were found to have 
an outside bank account it might 
constitute bad management and 
Senate could freeze the clubs University-held Senate funding until 
the account was closed. However, 
he noted that freezing a clubs 
funds would be an extreme action 
and he would attempt to talk to 
the clubs leadership before doing 
so.
The Student Union does not
have an editorial board and there
fore has no elections. If faced with 
reports of an improper Tartan 
election Robitshek and DiVito 
agreed that they would investi
gate before takingaction. If board 
members are elected fraudulently, 
they [the Senate] would ask for 
them to be re-elected, I think, 
Robitshek said. Both Robitshek 
and DiVito said that The Tartans 
funds would be frozen only as a 
final step if the paper refused to 
hold new elections.
DiVito explained that the Sen
ate fiscal policy is not clear about 
the procedure required to freeze 
an organizations funds. He said 
it is possible that he could do it 
himself but that it might take the 
approval of the Senate. He com
mented, I dont think it has been 
done very much in the past.
If a situation ever arose where 
an organizations funds might 
have to be frozen, DiVito said that 
he would try to avoid making the 
decision alone. Unless its some
thing that requires immediate 
action, Id want the whole Senate 
to decide, or at least the entire 
[Funding and Recognition] com
mittee.
If a club has its funds frozen, 
the freeze only applies to Senate 
money, according to DiVito. Any 
independent funds, such as Tar
tan or Student Union advertisii 
revenue, could not be frozen evi 
though they are kept in the o 
ganizationsUniversity account
This year, The Tartan receivf 
only 25% of its income, or $34,Oft 
from its Senate subsidy. Th 
Student Union, according to fi, 
ures supplied by Student Senaii 
received approximately 93% ofit 
$14,325 operating budget froi 
Senate subsidies.
Neither Robitshek nor DiVil 
were certain whether an organ 
zation could be locked out of itso 
fices if it lost its Senate recogn 
tion. Duquesnes SGA locked tb 
Duke out of its offices after sui 
pending the Dukes constitute 
At Duquesne the suspension 
an organizations constitution 
equivalent to the loss of Sena 
recognition at CMU.
Robitshek and DiVito sped 
lated that since organizatioi 
must be recognized to meet 
campus, a loss of recogniti( 
might result in a loss of offt 
space. However, an organizatic 
does not have to be funded to I 
recognized by Senate.
Robitshek said that he profo 
bly could not order an organic 
tions office locks to be change 
immediately as Duquesne SG 
President Happy Meltzer did vw 
the Dukes offices.

ast Ball.
Midani would not confirm or deny that 
jecision, saying he has been sick for the 
ast week and unable to attend any 
jeetings.
Moreover, in addition to alcohol conumption, Student Affairs was worried 
boutdruguse, student safety, andproprty damage. Whenever you take a group 
f 1200 people, whether they are underraduates, graduates, or alumni, and 
tuff them in a building, youre going to 
ave problems, said Ron Campana, 
issistant dean of Student Affairs.
Meetings started Friday
A flurry of meetings was kicked off by 
je administrations Student Issues 
ommittee last Friday. Made up of faclty and administrators, this committee 
irtually cancelled the Ball in a memo 
ated January 30. Signed by Walter, the 
lemo called the Ball uncontrollable 
nd barred it from CFA because no 
iculty member or administrator is willig to take the responsibility for the 
uccessful management of alcohol. 
Nonetheless, at Fridays meeting, the 
ommittee invited Troy Lambert, Jill 
luby, and Marta Fuentealba  CFA 
tudents and members of the Beaux Arts
Having a Beaux Arts Ball does not mean 
having a drunken disaster. 
 President Andy Robitshek
Ball Committee  and suggested ways 
to move the Ball off-campus. In addition 
to recommending that they come up with 
a written proposal to reduce their liabil
ity, the committee told the students they 
should monitor themselves with student 
and faculty chaperones at the Ball, ac
cording to Lambert.
Even though this committee has been 
talking about the Ball since November, 
it has never invited students to any of its 
meetings, relying on Walter to commu
nicate with the Balls organizers. If I 
had known that this committee could 
help me or even if it existed, then I would 
have gone to them a lot earlier, said 
Lambert, a senior art major who chairs 
the student Beaux Arts committee.
The next meeting was Saturday be
tween Lambert, Student Ombudsman 
Michael Murphy, Vice President for 
Enrollment William Elliott, and Vice 
President for Business Affairs Frederick 
Rogers. We just discussed the general 
conditions under which the Ball can
happen off-campusthe same as we did 
Friday, said Elliott.
At a Beaux Arts Ball Committee meet
ing later Saturday, Ruby divided the 12 
CFA students who attended into sub
committees and explained the admini
strations stand. We need to get 50 fac
ulty and students to serve as monitors to 
help keep people under control. Other
wise we cant have the Ball.
I want to keep things under control, 
but I dont want to be responsible for 
anyone elses actions, said Malik 
Johnson, a freshman art major who at
tended the meeting. Most of the other 
students agreed with Johnson.
Two more meetings are scheduled for 
this week. Yesterday, Lambert and 
Murphy were supposed to meet, and an 
open meeting is scheduled for tomorrow 
at 9:45 pm in the CFA Loge.
Still no money
As The Tartan reported last week, the
Beaux Arts Ball Committee has still not 
received any money from either Student 
Affairs or CFA. While CFAs Myers would 
not comment on funding, Student Af
fairs Walter claims that Lambert has 
never submitted a budget.
In the past, Student Affairs has set up 
A Ball account based on the tickets the 
committee expected to sell. No one in 
this office has ever seen a budget. It is 
real apparent that the committee has 
done no preparation, said Walter.
Lambert and Ruby contend that they 
submitted a budget, but were told to look 
for funds elsewhere, including from 
Student Senate and President Richard 
Cyert. While Senate cannot fund private 
events, Cyert has agreed to pay for buses 
to and from Metropol, according to Ruby.
Without money or even a specific date, 
the committee has not been able to hire 
entertainment, caterers, or even sign a 
binding contract with Metropol.
CMUs oldest tradition
The first Beaux Arts Ball was held in 
1915; at least 20 others since have been 
held in the Fine Arts building. In fact, 
the Ball in CFA is the oldest tradition 
Carnegie Mellon has, according to Uni
versity Archivist Gabrielle Michalek.
As the Ball moves off-campus, many
students feel that its tradition is dying. 
When you move it off-campus, the Ball 
loses a lot of its charm and history, said 
fifth-year architect Norm Larson, who 
organized a Wamer-Hall protest by 60 
CFA students when the Ball was 
cancelled three weeks ago.
Having it in CFA is the traditioh 
because that is our building. Its where 
all of CFA can come together, said Ruby.
Students across all the colleges sup
port the Ball. Two weeks ago, Student 
Senate passed a resolution demanding 
that the Ball be held in CFA.
In addition, at the Board of Trustees 
meeting last Monday, Student Goverriment President Andy Robitshek defende d 
the Ball and asked that it be moved back 
to CFA. I would recommend the trus
tees push the administration to plan this 
event. Having a Beaux Arts Ball does not 
mean having a drunken disasterrather 
a well managed event where uncontrolled 
behavior will be dealt with before it 
happens, he said in a prepared speech 
before the trustees.
On the other hand, the Balls organiz
ers are getting tired of fighting. This 
whole thing is really starting to affect my 
grades and studies. Im a senior and:! 
want to graduate, Lambert told The 
Tartan. I just wish they would decide 
whether theyre going to do it or not.

signs goal of $200 million will 
lemetby the April 19,1991 deadine. So far, the needed $30-$35 
lillion for the Center is only at 
bout the $500,000 mark, accordlgto Brannick. We havent given 
p on [the Center], said Cyert. 
Brannick stated that most of 
he gifts have come from sources 
le Campaigns organizers did not 
Dnsider at first. Were just now 
iginning to start on the big pros
ects, said Brannick. He hopes 
lat with these prospects, large 
funds directed for the Center may 
e obtained. Our best days are 
head, he commented.
If a separate campaign solely 
ir the University Center is 
eeded, Brannick projects that 
ne might be scheduled to begin 
ear June 30, 1991, after the 
lapital Campaign and at the end 
of the schools fiscal year.
Aside from the major donors
wanting their money to go to other 
projects, delays and other prob
lems for the master plan also 
stand in the way of the University 
Center.
Brannick said that when the 
University Center plans were first 
being laid out, allowances for 
housing and parking were not 
taken into account. There have 
been a lot of twists and turns in 
the master plan, he said.
Brannick admits that the new 
dorm, football field, and parking 
lot have caused problems for the 
master plan in that it has had to 
keep expanding it focus. Housing 
became a concern when city resi
dents began complaining about 
students living in off-campus 
housing. Also, parking, a peren
nial problem at CMU, got even 
tougher when the city further 
limited the schools access to legal 
parking. Weve really been deal
ing with eight capital campaigns,
said Brannick, Things would be 
easier if we did not have a whole 
list of [projects].
Another factor for the Centers 
delay is the current state of con
struction on the East Campus 
Project. Were further off sched
ule than we thought we would be 
five or six years ago, said Bran
nick. In the course of the master 
plan, the East Campus Project 
must get finished, he said.
Even with all of the unforeseen 
problems that have hindered the 
University Center and the mas
ter plan as a whole, Brannick 
stated, Weve done very well 
managing this type of conglomer
ate [project]. He added that if the 
master plan had kept its scope 
limited, some opportunities to 
help the school even more may 
have been missed.
Cyert is expected to make a for
mal statement about the issue in 
the next month.

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  21 February 19897
4Gc uga"a Duke
continued from page 4
myself as much as I could during 
that time just because ! didnt 
want an allegation like this to 
arise. She said that the elections 
were managed by another board 
member acting as judge of elec
tions. Klein has said that this 
person will appear at the Judicial 
Board elections to testify that the 
elections were handled properly.
The Duke board contends that 
the SGA investigation was 
prompted by a family planning 
advertisement that ran in the 
Duke on January 20 and 26 and 
February 9. After the first time it 
ran Meltzer and Drumm spoke 
about the ad; Meltzer asked the 
Duke not to run the ad again 
because it conflicted with the 
Catholic beliefs upon which 
Duquesne is founded.
After the ad ran again the fol
lowing week, Meltzer sent a let
ter tr Drumm stating, The ad 
should not reappear. If it does, 
the SGA will have no choice but to 
examine the operation of our 
student newspaper.
The final time the ad ran, on 
February 9, the Duke put a dis
claimer above it stating that The 
following advertisement does not 
necessarily reflect the views or 
values of Duquesne University.
The SGA suspended the Dukes 
constitution on February 12. 
McNamara feels that closing 
down the paper so quickly after 
the final ad shows that the ad was 
the real reason it was done. He 
said They kept telling us they 
didnt want the ad in there and 
that they would take action or
they would investigate. We ran 
the ad and they investigated. One 
is a direct result of the other. 
The SGA denied the charge. 
According to Meltzer, [The sus
pension] has nothing to do with 
the ads that appeared in print. 
He said that the timing of the 
investigation was coincidental 
and that it began when it did 
because the SGA recently received 
complaints from several students 
about the account and Drumms 
re-election.
Duquesne senior Paul Kominos 
feels that the situation was 
handled poorly by the SGA and 
thinks that other students agree. 
Obviously they have the right to 
close down an organization, he 
said, but when the student gov
ernment closes down the newspa
per, thats just not right. 
Kominos also felt that the in
vestigation was in reaction to 
the ad and then it became per
sonal because Rebecca Drumm 
wouldnt do what the student 
government wanted, which was 
to pull the ad. He added, We 
have to take the lesser of two evils 
here. The Duke was not a good 
newspaper. The student govern
ment is not a good organization. 
Junior Emmett Mateer feels 
that the situation was handled 
terribly and that SGA should 
have avoided the appearance that 
they were reacting to the ad. 
However, unlike Kominos, he felt 
that the Duke board should not 
have published The Free Press. I 
dont think she [Drumm] had any 
right to go to a different school 
and print a paper, he said.

4mM md" Mn"aa"aBB
When Duquesnes Student Govern
ment President Happy Meltzer changed 
the locks on the Dukes offices last Sun
day, he went far beyond protecting 
Duquesnes student body from a contra
ceptive ad; he violated the first amend
ment right of free speech.
Our political system is based on a 
complicated series of checks and bal
ances with a free press serving as a 
watchdog over the elected government. 
When the press is silenced, this system 
does not function.
Clearly, our society requires the free 
flow of ideas and information.
' However, Meltzer and his fellow student-government henchmen operate 
under a different system, where criti
cism from an obstinate media is cen
sored and shut down.
However, we dont condone financial 
mismanagement or crooked elections. 
The Duke has been accused ofboth. These 
charges, regardless of the organization 
ifi question, should be investigated. If 
they are substantiated, that organiza
tion should be punished.
' However, just as Duquesnes Student 
Go-vernment Association expects the 
Duke to be managed responsibly, the 
SGA should run its investigation respon
sibly. For example, the SGA should not 
have suspended the Duke's constitution 
belere its investigation. This is unques
tionably a case of punishment coming
before trial.
In addition, the SGA has offered to 
reinstate the papers staff as long as it 
replaces current Editor-in-Chief Rebecca 
Drumm, pending further investigation. 
This offer is no less offensive than the 
original suspension, since it doesnt fully 
restore the newspapers autonomy.
According to the papers consti-tution, 
only the Dukes staff can remove the 
editor since the staff elected her in the 
first place. As a result, the Dukes staff 
should not publish without Drumm. In
stead, theDufee's editors should hold out, 
publishing off campus if they have to, 
until the SGA is investigated.
A little closer to home, we support 
Student Senates resolution condemn
ing Duquesnes SGA Senate showed that 
it recognizes the value of a independent 
and uncensored pressan understand
ing that is essential for student govern
ments.
Because at least a part of their fun ding 
usually originates from student govern
ments, student newspapers require spe
cial attention so that they can retain 
their autonomy. This sometimes-unhappy financial arrangement puts col
lege newspapers in a tenuous situation, 
becoming the pawn of the governments 
they are supposed to monitor.
Someday, maybe everyone will realize 
that a free society starts with a free 
press.
What is a suspicious person?
Last semester, 37 black students staged 
a protest in the Office of Student Affairs, 
claiming that members of the Carnegie 
Mellon campus were insensitive to the 
plight of minority groups.
At-the time, some students thought 
the. blacks were overreacting, taking 
offense when none was intended, 
fiiit consider the following:
On January 6, five-year CFA alumnus 
DaVid Turner, a black employed locally 
by AT&T, returned to campus to get a 
copy of his transcript. After obtaining 
one, Turner went to the CFA building, 
hoping to find some of his old teachers.
Instead, he encountered a current art 
professor. Turner and the professor had 
what Turner describes as a nice conver
sation. Turner asked about some of his 
old.professors, and departed afterhe was 
told that none were present.
About 30 minutes later, after visiting 
Doherty Hall to find that his sculpture 
teather was also not on campus, Turner 
was approached and detained by Cam
pus Police officers. They claimed he was 
a s.uspicious person.
Producing a drivers license and the 
transcript, Turner identified himself as 
an alumnus and was released 12 minuteS later. He returned home unharmed 
but-saddened.
Ittums out that the artprofessorwith 
whom Turner spoke reported him to 
Security. The professor, it seems, had a 
similar encounter with a black male in
his twenties on September 30  the af
ternoon his office was burgled and $2000 
of property was stolen.
There is a question Turner has had on 
his mind recently: What makes a per
son suspicious? Does he act suspicious? 
Or does he look suspicious?
We at The Tartan would like to take 
Turners question a step further: If both 
of the men with whom the art professor 
spoke were white, would the second have 
been detained? We dont think so.
Theres no doubt that Security only did 
its job  namely, to investigate a suspi
cious person. When it found Turner was 
legitimate, it let him go, as it should 
have.
But if youre putting yourself in the 
professors shoes and deciding that what 
he did wasnt so bad, think again. Maybe 
the professor was not acting out of preju
dice when he called Security and re
ported Turner.
But he was undoubtedly, unmistaka
bly, and inexcusably prejudiced when he 
connected, in his mind, a visit by a black 
male and a subsequent robbery. That 
prejudice didnt show itself until Turner 
wandered, unsuspecting, into the CFA 
Loge months later.
We at The Tartan are not suggesting 
that members of the campus community 
hesitate to call Security when they see a 
suspicious person. But lets make sure 
he or she is actingand notjust looking
 suspicious.

Gas leak raises concern for building safety
Editor:
The recent gas leak near Baker/Porter/Scaife, and other recent incidents, 
have brought to light several significant 
safety problems in Baker Hall. Members 
of my department have raised these is
sues with the directors of campus safety, 
but I understand that these problems 
will not be addressed for some time (two 
years, in some cases). In the event of a 
real emergency, the current situation 
could be quite dangerous.
The fire alarm system in the building 
has some serious flaws. There are parts 
of the building where an alarm can barely 
be heard, and if there is any significant 
noise in the area (such as construction or 
maintenance, a fairly common occurrence 
these days), alarms cannot be heard at 
all. This is extremely dangerous; people 
in the far reaches of the fourth floor 
shouldnt have to rely on hoping that 
someone will come tell them about an 
evacuation.
Of course, even when the alarm can be 
heard, many people ignore it because of 
the recent rash of false alarms. These are 
not due to pranks, but to malfunctions. 
(People who have called Security to ask 
if its a real emergency have usually got
ten conflicting or ambiguous reports.) 
One has to wonder, given the malfunc
tions, whether the alarms would propLetters to the Editor
erly detect all real emergencies. How 
thorough are the regular system tests? 
Probably not thorough enough, if the in
cident in Wean Hall is representative.
A serious concern arose after the gas 
leak last Wednesday. The building was 
apparently evacuated when the leak was 
detected. I arrived on campus shortly 
after the evacuation, andnot knowing 
of any problem  walked into my office, 
via the front door of Baker. Imagine my 
surprise in seeing, an hour and a half 
later, a bboard notice saying it was safe 
to re-enter the building! I had never 
known it wasnt safe. No alarms were 
ringing, and no one was standing outside 
the doors to warn people off. It is not 
valid to assume that no one will try to 
enter a building that has been evacu
ated; not everyone was there at the time 
of the evacuation. (Due to propagation 
delays, a bboard announcing the prob
lem did not reach our machines until 
hours after the all-clear message. But we 
shouldnt be relying solely on bboards to 
spread this sort of information.)
At the very least, the alarm should 
continue to ring after an evacuation until 
an all-clear has been given. I suspect
that most people would stop to find out 
what was going on if they walked into a 
building where an alarm was ringing. Of 
course, this might be a slight annoyance 
to the police or firemen investigating the 
problem, but whats more important, 
convenience or safety?
Fortunately this time there was no 
real emergency; the gas leak did not 
endanger the building or its occupants. 
What will happen next time?
Several months ago there was a fire in 
Wean Hall which knocked out the elec
tricity, and the occupants of the building 
discovered that there was no functioning 
backup system. As a result, evacuation* 
was slow and dangerous; many parts of 
the building do not have windows. Only 
after this incident and number of coirt 
plaints did the university begin to worry 
about this problem. Shouldnt this have 
come up during testing? They do test the 
systems every now and then, dont theyl 
Why did it take a real emergency to get 
the problem fixed? And why didnt the 
University learn from the incident and 
examine safety in other buildings?
Id like to know how the university is 
going to prevent this reckless endanger: 
ment in the future.

H&SS rep on search committee was a bad choice i
Editor:
Id like to express a criticism of the 
choices made for the Presidential Search 
Committee representatives of the differ
ent colleges. Andy Robitshek, the presi
dent of the student body, chose among 
four nominated candidates in each col
lege to be a representative. But since 
Andy has class on Tuesday nights when 
the Student Senate meets, he was un
able to attend the meeting in which he 
had to decide on the candidates.
I sat in on Tuesdays meeting. Since 
Andy wasnt at the meeting, it would 
seem that the candidate who received 
the most votes from the student senators 
would likely be chosen as the represen
tative, unless Andy had good reason to 
believe the top vote-getter was at odds 
with the students or that another candi
dates position was considerably more 
representative of the students. Among 
the four H&SS candidates, Marc Roston 
was chosen. Marc did not receive the 
majority vote, Lisa Kochan did, so what 
position did Mr. Roston take that was so 
persuasive?
Marc said that the candidates should 
have no beliefs about how the next Presi
dent should be chosen. Marc said that he 
was that candidate who has no beliefs.
All of the other three candidates ex
pressed their ideas about the next presi
dent. Paraphrasing Lisa Kochan, she 
said that in order for CMU to continue to 
attract students nationally, the quality 
of the H&SS department would have to 
be improved and that the next president 
should be committed to that idea. Since 
the statement is unlikely to be opposed 
by too many H&SS students, I think it 
represents the interests of the college 
well.
Rostons position was that having be
liefs would interfere with the represen
tatives ability to listen to H&SS stu
dents. Suppose that, it is possible for 
Marc to have fewer beliefs than the other 
candidates and that this helps him listen 
to students interests. Then how does he 
propose to sift through the opinions of 
H&SS students? To get an accurate rep
resentation of H&SS, I suppose he would 
have to do a survey on questions like
whether H&SS should be improved or 
not. Maybe then hed support Lisas 
radical position.
But I really cant blame Marc Roston jj 
for taking the position he did. It just si 
happened that the person making thel 
decision on the representatives, oui 
student body president, Andy Robitshek,1 
also has no beliefs.
In his reasoning for choosing Marcl 
Roston, Andy said that Marc would 
best able to represent H&SS. I guess this 
is because Andy figures that H&SS stu-1 
dents are an apathetic bunch who dont I 
care much about the future of the Uni; I 
versity and therefore need to be repre: 9 
sented by a person who reaches that high 
level of apathy.
When Lisa Kochan received the most 
votes from Senate, wasnt that an indi* 
cation that the Senate recommended her 
to be the representative? I believe that 
Andy used poor judgment in deciding 
the H&SS representative.

Art Department should adopt new grading system
Editor:
Everybody in the Art Department 
seems to know that giving grades in the 
field of visual arts is one of the most 
ludicrous and pointless traditions, toler
ated singularly for the sake of tradition. 
It is evident, in this decade of pluralistic 
art awareness, that there are no set of 
rulers that can possibly measure out 
how good a students work is and where 
a students work stands in relation to his 
or her fellow classmates. How is it pos
sible, Ive often wondered, for any art in
structor to determine which of the five 
letters (A,B,C,D, or R) each individual 
student deserves?
My observation tells me that every 
instructor has his or her own style in 
handling the situation. The evaluation 
method ranges from counting the num
ber of paintings done in a semester, to 
recalling how agreeable a student is to 
the instructor him or herself during the
course of the semester.
Speaking from my three years of expe
rience in this art department, the letter 
grades I have received in my studio 
classes in the past (they happen to range 
from A through D) have not, in any way, 
contributed to my process of cultivating 
self as an artist. If anything, they have 
always been an annoying obstacle which 
prevented me from seeing the idea of 
art as an expression of self. It is rather 
sad to think that the desire to have a 
neat row of As on a report card could be 
an artists source of inspiration.
I realize that for the sake of preserving 
prestige in the name of our University, 
it is difficult to abandon the current inef
ficient grading system. But, neverthe
less, I would like to propose a simple 
solution which should be applied to all of 
the studio classes in the Art Depart
ment. The idea is to replace the imper
sonal and mysterious alphabetical grades
with an instructors thoughtful written! 
evaluation for his or her student. There] 
will still have to be a pass/fail system 
but at least students would be informed 
of why he or she is in the state of either 
passing or failing. As far as I know, thisl 
written evaluation system is success-] 
fully practiced at a number of othei 
schools such as Bennington and Univer
sity of California in Santa Cruz.
This written evaluation system apj 
plied to this department should elinii;] 
nate some of the unnecessary tensioi 
which apparently exists now within thj 
department.
The Art Department should be a coflj 
munity in which artists have a dialogs 
going on among themselves, and not 
stage for competition or ranking amid5*] 
peers.

Hemlines must come down! 
After six straight years of ecoomic growth and rising skirts, 
!e economy is at a crossroads, 
iither hemlines will fall, or we

For those of you who arent

bulled, and more Americans than 
ever fbund work.
A coincidence? I dont think so. 
Its just part of the cyclical nature 
offashion and the GrossNational 
Product.
But now the economy once again 
threatens to overheat; as the 
economy continues to grow, infla
tion begins to rise. For instance, 
here it is in freezing February 
and I see dozens of women on this 
campus with skirts above the 
knee. And economists wonder why
housing starts jumped eight per
cent in January.
President Johnson was faced 
with the same problem in the late 
1960s  mini-skirts and full 
employment. His advisors sug
gested he raise taxes, but he re
fused, throwing the economy into 
a recession.
George Bushs decision is even 
more critical. Unless hemlines 
fall, inflation will rise. If inflation 
rises, Federal Reserve Chairman 
Alan Greenspan will raise inter
est rates. Higher interest rates 
mean that financing the federal 
deficit will cost even more.
But its even worse than that. 
Higher interest rates mean that 
the dollar will rise, making U.S. 
goods even more expensive 
abroad, which will cause the trade 
deficit to widen. Bad trade news, 
if you remember, triggered the 
stock market crash in October 
1987.
Many people, including Presi
dent Bush, hope that Alan Green
span wont continue the rise in 
interest rates. But I know how to 
stop him.
You see, Greenspan and the rest 
of the Federal Reserve are also 
watching hemlines. The Feds 
Blue Book, which obstensibly 
contains economic forecasts for 
the next six months, is really a 
sample of various womens cloth
ing catalogs. Thats the real rea
son why the Blue Book is classi
fied.
So if women would wear longer 
clothing, the economy will run 
smoothly. Barbara Bush has al
ready started the trend. Then 
again, maybe George should just 
go ahead and raise taxes.

izing that to stay home is to get 
impossibly far behind, they go to 
a class. Get sick again. Have to 
miss another day. Feel a little 
better. Go to class. Get sick again. 
Ad infinitum.
The big problem is that once 
you get sick at college, its hard to 
get well. Its hard to eat when you 
are too sick to go out of your room 
(unless youve hoarded up on 
canned goods). This slows down 
your recovery. Its tough to rest 
when the stereo in the room next 
to you is shaking your posters 
down. This also slows down your 
recovery. And most of the time
you head back to classes and work 
before youre totally recovered. 
This leads to relapses.
I just heard through the grape
vine that administrators at Penn 
State University have closed and 
quarantined the campus due to 
an outbreak of the flu. While 
Carnegie Mellon does not have a 
health problem as severe as the 
one at Penn State, it might be 
worthwhile to take all this as a 
word of warning.
I have been at Carnegie Mellon 
for three years now and I have 
never seen as many people sick 
during a two week period. I dont 
think I know one person who 
hasnt been feeling at least a little 
under the weather, if not worse. 
With all the coughing and sneez
ing going on, my fraternity house 
sounds like a TB ward and when 
I visited Morewood Gardens the 
other night, for a second I thought
On February 9, 1989, George 
ish addressed the Joint Sesons of Congress for the first time 
President, and unfortunately, 
; neglected to mention the aboron issue.
The closest he came was say.. we must care for those 
oundus. A decent society shows 
mpassion for the young, the 
derly, the vulnerable, and the 
5 poor. Our first obligation is to the 
ost vulnerable  infants, poor 
others, children living in povty  and my proposed budget 
cognizes this ... I ask for full 
nding of Medicaid ... to include 
verage of pregnant women who 
e near the poverty line.
I agree with President Bush, 
individuals, we have an oblition to the most vulnerable. 
todays society, however, the 
3st vulnerable are the unborn, 
cause abortion-on-demand is 
jal, there exists no law, no 
vernment funding, and no govJeff Fartro
ernment agency to protect the 
unborn.
By omitting the abortion issue, 
President Bush has disappointed 
the anti-abortion groups that 
worked so hard to elect him. I 
dont doubt that Bush opposes 
abortion  at least in most cir
cumstances. However, I do ques
tion his personal commitment to 
stopping this practice. If he had 
solid anti-abortion convictions, he 
would use his opportunities be
fore Congress and the American 
people to promote specific anti
abortion views.
Now is not the time for anti
abortionists, as Bush claims to 
be, to pull back and become si
lent. The greatest opportunities 
for ending abortion exist today. 
With a post-Reagan Supreme 
Court ready to rule on an abor
tion case and increased public
awareness concerning abortion, 
the anti-abortionists must move 
forward, continuing to attack the 
issue on every front.
President Bush should use his 
presidential authority to promote 
the anti-abortion cause in several 
ways. For example, the media 
should be used more effectively. 
Advertisements need to be run 
that expose abortion for what it 
really is  the murder of an inno
cent life. The pro-abortionists 
certainly havent wasted any time 
here. They are running dozens of 
full page coat hanger ads in 
major newspapers and maga
zines. Their cause is in deep, deep 
trouble and they know it.
Politically, the anti-abortionists 
need to put more pressure on 
government officials. This in
cludes Supreme Court Justices, 
Congressmen, and Attorney 
General Richard Thornburgh. 
Also, new emphasis should be 
placed on amending the
Constitution to include a human 
life amendment.
President Bush encourages 
parents to be involved in their 
childrens education. Why not 
encourage humane people to stop 
abortion? Using his influence, 
Bush could persuade people to 
work to illegalize abortion at the 
local, state, and federal level.
George Bush has said that he 
wants to be known as the educa
tion president, but he has set his 
sights too low. If he wants to be 
remembered as a truly great 
president, he should change the 
priorities on his agenda and move 
abortion to the top of it. Any other 
accomplishments that he will 
make will fade and be forgotten 
compared to what might have 
been done to change one of the 
darkest moments in American 
history.

visit to Crazy Seymours Sun emporium...
luchwald gets the truth about the NRA and gun laws
Every once in a while I drop by 
np see Crazy Seymour, owner of 
eSafe and Sane Discount Gun 
nporium in Virginia.
[f you want a good buy on a 
ooter, there is no better place to 
than Crazy Seymours.
Hows business? I ask him. 
Better than Christmas, he 
?lied. Were having a run on 
-automatic machine guns. I 
nt keep them in the window. 
|Why is that?
Panic in the streets. People are 
rvous that someone is going to 
to take their semi-automatics 
,ay from them. Its overkill, 
lere will never be any shortages 
Machine guns in your lifetime 
niine.
Why is the public so agitated 
sales of guns that kill people? 
We dont sell guns to those who 
pt to kill strangers. We sell 
fin purely for sport.
What kind of me can you 
tot with an AK-47?
Duck, pheasant, deer, rabbit. 
u name it  an AK will blow 
phead off any ofthem. Of course,
Art Buchwald
some hunters prefer the Uzi sub
machine gun when it comes to 
shooting a squirrel.
Crazy Seymour, I know that 
you are dead set against your 
guns getting into the wronghands, 
but how can you be sure that the 
person buying a semi-automatic 
really wants to use it to waste a 
possum?
Gun dealers have iron-clad 
safeguards. Every customer has 
to fill out a form swearing on his 
mothers grave that he will not 
kill a cop. He also has to assert 
that he has never been sentenced 
to the electric chair, or has spent 
more than 30 days in a padded 
cell, or has held up a gas station 
between the hours of midnight 
and 6 am. After he fills out this 
form, we check his Diners Club 
card for character references. 
Only then does he get his ma
chine gun in the box. According to 
law, he cant unwrap it until he 
leaves the store.
What do you do with the signed 
affidavits?
We make paper airplanes out 
of them and send them across the 
parking lot. Look, I dont sell a 
gun to just anyone who comes in 
here. If a guy spits on the floor, I 
tell him to get the hell out. We 
want women and children to buy 
guns from us as well as men. 
Im glad you dont have a prob
lem with selling semi-automatics 
to the public.
The National Rifle Association 
doesnt, so why should I? There 
are not going to be any restric
tions as long as everyone pays 
their NRA dues and makes sure 
that Congress gets a lot of money. 
I told Crazy Seymour, But I get 
the feeling that the Hill may pass

The Never Ending Story 
David N. Levy
With the capital campaign get
ting into the home stretch, I think 
that its time to consider some 
alternative methods of getting 
donations for the University. In 
the Wall Street Journal last week, 
Thursdays cutesy story in sec
tion two talked about a creative 
way of giving to a college.
It seems that endowing schol
arships, chairs, and professor
ships are starting to get pass, at 
least at the College of Wooster, so 
now you can endow a tree. Woos
ter was given $200,000 to take 
care of the trees on their campus, 
but first they have to raise an
other $100,000.
Here at Carnegie Mellon you 
have the alternative of endowing 
a book. Imagine if the concept 
was applied here to Carnegie 
Mellon traditions.
We can create all kinds offunds. 
First we start off by endowing a 
fund for rumors. We should ac
tively pursue increasing the 
amount of misinformation on this 
campus. We can pay people to say 
things like:
Baker was going to be a factory 
if the school didnt work out. 
Scotland Yard is really run by 
Dining Services and it serves left
overs from Kiltie.
The name of the Dean of Stu
dent Affairs is Brad Walters.
If this doesnt sound like some
thing youve heard, you should 
take a tour with admissions.
Maybe we should have a fund 
for the Fence. Each year all the 
people who sit out at night could 
use a radiator, or alternatively, a 
fan. Then the only problem is 
where would they plug it in, the 
trees? Maybe we should arrange
for a Fence Fund to pay for wiring 
up the fence with speakers. Then 
we could listen to music as we 
walked across campus.
If that doesnt sound like a good 
idea, what do you think about 
endowing the Physical Plant gocarts? Those carts do a lot of work 
around here, and I think it woufd 
be great to see them with a name 
besides Carnegie Mellon written 
on the side. If the students co.uW ' 
borrow them we could have a dif
ferent kind of buggy race. There 
goes Ted Danson around the first : 
turn and coming up quickly be
hind is Andy Warhol followed by 
Barbara Bosson. Then again, 
maybe not.
Maybe we should adopt parts of 
the University as our own. In 
Hollywood they have stars, we 
have the class plates and Hammerschlags nose. People in Hol
lywood pay money so they can 
clean the stars; someone must be' 
willing to pay to clean the class 
plates in Baker Hall. And al
though Hamerschlags nose -is 
pretty shiny the rest of him could 
use a good cleaning.
But when it really comes down 
to it, I think that money really 
has to be raised for new chairs. 
No, not chairs for professors or 
lecture hall chairs. Im talking 
about someplace that can really 
use new tables and chairs: Kiltie. 
All those little plaques on them, 
just like in a church. Just imag
ine, you could sit down for a meal 
and the table wouldnt be at chest 
level. The only problem Ive got 
with this is that all those plaques 
would be painful to sit on.

jwThe Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  21 February 1989
Student says petty quarrels have no place in the newspaper
Editor:
In recent issues of The Tartan, 
there has been a continuing con
troversy between ATO Brothers 
and two other people, Steven 
Peters and Kevin Barney. Also 
entering upon the scene in the 2/ 
J4/89 issue was Valerie Pushwa. 
Its beginnings were contained 
in Kevin Barneys letter, [ATO 
and airband not a good mix 11/ 
22/88]. This letter was a simple 
cut-up of ATOs performance at 
the airband contest last semes
ter. Mentioned comments were 
the record was of poor quality and 
the ATO brothers were loud dur
ing the performance, screaming 
and singing along.
Of course, ATO must defend its 
position in this attack, and does 
so in a retort by Peter Pa
pagianakis [ATO defends Air
band behavior 1/24/89]. All in 
all, this was a justified defense 
and it addressed the topic well, 
except for the side comment of 
wanting to find Mr. Barney and 
smash his face, a typical ATO 
reaction. Also, I do believe that 
Mr. Barney was correct in his 
assessment that asking the ATO 
brothers to keep it down during 
the performance would have 
worked out well.
I would also be quick to point 
out that 1: There was no reason 
for Mr. Barney to even complain 
about their rowdiness unless they 
had physically attacked him, and
ATO is not to be singled out. I 
believe ANY of the fraternities or 
Special interest groups would 
simply care more about support
ing their brethren on stage than 
some person who doesnt care
Letters to the Editor_______
about them. Although, the face 
smashing seems a bit overly reac
tive, I believe the point was that 
Mr. Barney went to The Tartan 
and publicized the whole matter 
with no sound basis.
Next came Mr. Barneys apol
ogy [Airband critic answers 
ATOs comments and says, 
Thanks for not smashing my 
face! 1/31/89]. The apology was 
geared towards the publishing of 
his reaction in The Tartan, which 
I can think we all believe was the 
wrong thing to do.
Got it? Great. Now onto the fun 
stuff. Suddenly, low and behold, 
ATO is once again in the Letters 
page with a letter from Steven 
Peters [After his own conflict with 
ATO brothers, student claims 
apology came far too soon  2/7/ 
89]. And what a gripping saga 
unfolds! Mr. Peters brings for
ward his personal problems with 
ATO. Well, actually, it isnt even 
ATO, just two of the brothers. 
But, Mr. Peters claims that in a 
stats recitation, he was verbally 
attacked after asking Mr. Papagianakis and friend, Bill Snyder 
to keep their chit-chat noise down.
And now finally for the last part 
of the story. Mr. Papagianakis 
must again defend his actions that 
have been brought forward to the 
newspaper. And for added sup
port, one Valerie Pushwa joins 
the fray [Yet another voice heard 
in the ATO controversy 2/14/89].
Obviously, Mr. Peters was play
ing with semantics when he 
mentioned several ATO broth
certainly dont want to see your 
stupid personal arguments flashing 
before me every week.
ers in his letter. Oh, but Mr. 
Papagianakis was quick to pick 
that up. It was only he and his 
sole fraternity brother. They 
admit, yes, that their conversa
tion was a bit loud, but it was defi
nitely not disturbing the class as 
Mr. Peters likes to point out. But 
Mr. Peters did abruptly turn 
around and uncouthly bellow, I 
am trying to listen to the recita
tion. 
However, here is where a dis
crepancy occurs. Did Mr. Papagianakas use foul language? He 
does admit he did, however, Miss 
Pushwa tends to disagree. But it 
really isnt important to my point.
I would like to state that the 
bringing of this argument to the 
editorial page (Letters to the 
Editor) of The Tartan was point
less and rather imbecile (unless 
Mr. Peters planned that having 
the world know about his prob
lem would save him from having 
his face smashed in). I also fault 
the staff for continuing the print
ing of what was so obviously a 
personal argument, and even 
more so now because it has de
generated into petty insults hid
den beneath large words found in 
a Thesaurus (i.e. physically re
taliate against..a frame that is 
innocuous as a fly, Mr. Pa
pagianakis.)

Midsemester lunacy hits college campuses
Midsemester break does 
funny things to people. For 
some, it means a chance to get 
away from Pittsburgh. For oth
ers, it means the start of free 
Tolls. To me, it doesnt mean 
anything; GSIA doesnt get its 
'midsemester break for another 
two weeks. But a lot of people 
seem to be in that strange mood.
I dont know when Duquesne 
has its break, but it could sure 
use it soon. They closed their 
student newspaper and have 
recieved the kind of publicity 
Vice Presidents for Public Rela
tions only dream about.
Normally what happens at 
Duquesne isnt a big deal to us, 
-but we had a subscription ex
change program with them, and 
now were stuck with an extra 
copy of The Tartan.
The Duquesne Student Gov
ernment Association decided 
'that it had had enough of birth 
' control ads and people reading 
newspapers in class. Last Sun- day they changed the locks at 
the office, and Duquesne hasnt 
had this much publicity since 
last year when they threw the
Inquiring Minds

Tamburitzans off campus.
Now to most of us, this isnt a 
big deal, after all, at Carnegie 
Mellon were used to newspapers 
losing their funding and getting 
it back again. Besides, it hap
pened downtown, miles removed 
from our campus.
Well this was different. There 
were no copyright violations, no 
four-letter headlines, just an ad 
for a local hospital promoting 
contraception. Their student gov
ernment president claimed the 
ad disagreed with the stated posi
tion of Duquesne. I suppose that 
means The Tartan would get 
closed down if we ran an ad pro
moting spending money on stu
dent services.
Midsemester fever has hit Car
negie Mellon, too. Its been a while 
since Dick was front-page news, 
and now hes back. Its official; 
Cyert will retire before the new 
student union opens up. This way 
he avoids having the new dorm
named after him, and moves to 
first in line for the union.
Im in my fourth year here 
now, and my second master 
plan. I liked the first one better; 
they were going to tear down 
Scaife Hall, an idea that would 
have guaranteed Warner Hall 
all the money it ever dreamed 
of.
Now we get Kiltie returned to 
the masses, as new office and 
meeting space once the new 
dorm is completed. Were al
ready losing Kiltie piece by 
piece, first the Cinzano umbrel
las are gone, next theyre going 
to get rid of the pickles from the 
deli line.
I never understood all of these 
things anyway, midsemester 
break is only a three-day week
end. Imagine if it were a whole 
week. The thought boggles the 
mind.

important to the general reader

"I CANT BELIEVE THIS IS HAPPEHlM6"
Finals policy is often ignored by professors
It may seem too early in the 
semester to begin thinking about 
finals, and perhaps it is. However, 
the registrars office released the 
final exam schedule for the se
mester last week and I would like 
to address one of my pet peeves 
about CMU while there may still 
be time to do something about it.
According to a statement pub
lished above the finals schedule in 
last weeks Tartan, the Faculty 
Senates policy on final exams 
says, in part, that papers shall be 
made due no later than on the last 
day of classes.
In my five semesters at CMU, I 
have found that this rule is com
monly ignored. Professors often 
assign papers, lab reports, and 
other assignments with due dates 
during finals week. In many cases 
the assignments will be made on 
top of other assignments due 
during the last week of classes.
If students object, the profes
sors generally offer to change the 
due date to the last day of classes 
knowing that the assignment can 
not reasonably be expected to be 
completed by that time, especially 
if another assignment is already 
due during that week. Faced with 
this choice, students usually agree 
to the due date during finals week
Jon Levy
without further argument for fear 
of making a bad situation worse.
I can understand a professors 
motivation in bending the rules 
to make an assignment due dur
ing finals week. There is a limited 
amount of teaching time in a 
semester and extending the dead
line allows a professor to create 
an assignment based on the con
tent of the last week of class. One 
more reading assignment, lab, or 
week of class discussions can be 
covered.
Undoubtedly, this extra teach
ing time adds to our education 
but at some point it becomes too 
much of a good thing. The last day 
of class deadline for assignments 
was established for a valid rea
son. Reviewing a semesters worth 
of work for three or four classes 
(sometimes more) in a week and a 
half is hard enough. Adding other 
assignments places an unfair 
burden on students. The extra 
work almost certainly causes 
some students to perform below 
their potential on tests which 
often account for 30 to 50 percent 
of their class grades.
Since students are effectively
a
deterred from raising objectic 
on a case-by-case basis, I wot 
like to ask the faculty and 
ministration to step in to so 
the problem. A combination 
peer pressure and reminders fn 
the registrar or deans might h 
bring professors into compliai 
with the Faculty Senate poli 
Beyond that, students should 
explicitly invited to report pn 
lems anonymously to the retrars office. The current fin 
policy invites students to speai ic 
department heads about vie 
tions of the policy, but manyi 
dents are unwilling to step 
ward because they fear l 
within a small department, v 
of their complaints might get b 
to their professors.
In fact, I considered not writ 
this column because of this e) 
fear; that I might offend any 
of my professors. However, I 
cided that I trust my profess 
and that something needed tc 
said. I hope somebody is lif]

A Spring Break 
alternative
| As the swimsuit issue and the 
break in the lousy weather 
remind us, Spring is on its way. 
About time, by God.
Budweiser has already begun 
sending out brochures about 
their Bud Beach Club. Its just 
jam packed with all of the really 
hip and happenin places all the 
really cool people will be going 
to over the Break. Its really a 
very handy little item. It tells of 
all the different Bud related 
events going on in Florida. It 
has everything from which con
certs will be playing, to places 
to take your empty beer cans for 
recycling.
Thats great. Go ahead and 
get drunk and throw up on the 
beach, but be sure to recycle 
your empty cans. After all, you 
wouldnt want to litter.
It also explains how to get 
ree Bud t-shirts and where 
vou can call home for free.
| One thing that is tucked away 
m the very last page (down in 
the corner), is a statement of 
the Florida drinking age. Sorry, 
mt it too is 21. Oh well. You 
shouldnt feel too embarrassed 
valking around the beach in 
your free Bud t-shirt, playing 
jvith your free Bud beach ball 
ind still not be able to actually 
Irink a Bud.
But be thankful. Unlike most 
ollege environments, you 
jshould not feel obligated to 
Bifill Descartes other proverb:
I drink, therefore I am.
By no means am I trying to 
mock Spring Break, Florida, or 
beer. However, I just feel that 
people should be willing to inestigate other avenues when 
Considering how to spend their 
lessed break time.
There is no law that says one 
must be at the beach. Disney 
i|Vorld is one alternative. But 
^mother, and much overlooked 
fidea, is Spring Training.
All winter long, weve been 
Rearing about these multi-milJjon dollar contracts baseball 
players have been getting. Well 
iere is a wonderful opportunity 
tp go down and see if all the 
[hype is really worth it.
1 Gamblers do it all the time.
You think that the guys who 
win at the track are just plain 
lucky? Ha! They know how to 
bet because they spend time 
polking with the horse trainers 
and seeing the horses workout 
f&efore the big race, 
p Before bragging to all of your 
jfriends about your team, go 
jdown and see it in training, 
goull find out fast whether you

1 Think of it. On Opening Day, 
While your friends are talking

Rollercoaster rides are meant 
for amusement parks. One would 
have never known that by looking 
at the Lady Tartans last week. 
Events ranged from winning a 
conference championship to pos
sibly missing a chance for an 
NCAA play-off berth. Thrown in 
with an emotionally charged 
Senior Day at Skibo Gym, the 
result is a very up and down week.
The Lady Tartans were relieved 
to know that they were still ranked 
third in their region after the loss 
to Washington University a week 
and a half ago. With that in mind, 
the Lady Tartans defeated the 
Allegheny Gators, 73-58, but did 
not expect the dip that they 
got at Grove City College, 
as they failed in their quest 
for an undefeated Presi
dentsAthletic Conference 
(PAC) season with a 62-61 
loss.
The ride was far from 
over, as Carnegie Mellon 
put on a very emotional 
Senior Day ceremony to com
memorate four seniors in their 
final home game. After the cere
mony, the Lady Tartans defeated 
the Lady Cats of Thiel College, 
80-62, to clinch their first-ever 
PAC title.
The Lady Tartans (18-6 over
all, 10-1 PAC) wait anxiously for 
the new regional rankings to see 
whether or not they will be ad
vancing to the NCAA play-offs.
Tears of joy poured onto the 
floor of Skibo Gym last Saturday 
as the Lady Tartans snatched the 
PAC championship from the three 
time defending champion, Thiel 
College. The tears started before 
the game did, as the team hon
ored senior tri-captains Lisa 
Lightner, Aimee Reber, and Beth 
Virgin, along with Roseanna 
Neupauer, each accompanied by

Tartan Assistant Sports Editor
Last Wednesday, the Carnegie 
Mellon swim teams began what 
proved to be a very triumphant 
week at Emory University in 
Atlanta, competing in the Uni
versity Athletic Association 
Championships. The teams ef
forts moved them up one spot in 
the UAA rankings, bringing the 
men into fourth place and the 
women into seventh.
The championships proved to 
be fruitful for the Tartans, who 
broke school and UAA records, 
qualifying for Division III and Natheir parents. It was a very touch
ing scene as Gerri Seidl said good
bye to her first recruited class. 
They could not hold back tears as 
they received flowers and the 
teams spokesperson, junior 
Donna Spicuzza, read a tribute.
The Lady Tartans started with 
a very tall lineup consisting of 
Reber, Virgin, Tricia Chorgo, Lisa 
Smith, and Lightner. Both teams 
came out in press defenses and 
fast breaking offenses. However, 
Thiel was without the services of 
their leading scorer and reboun
der Julie Sierota (15.9 ppg, 9.0 
rpg) and lost another starter, 
Rachel Rarah early in the game.
The Lady Tartans led by as 
many as seven points, but a 13-2 
run by Thiel gave them a six point
edge with seven and a half min
utes left in the half. CMU battled 
back in the closing minutes, tak
ing a 22-16 lead at the half.
Carnegie Mellon quickly 
jumped out to an 11 point lead 
early in the second half, and the 
champagne bottles began to cool 
back in the locker room. Fittingly, 
the Lady Tartans senior guard 
Roseanna Neupauer put the game 
away with a shot that put them 
up by 12 with less than five min
utes remaining.
With just under a minute to go, 
Seidl pulled all four seniors off 
the court at the same time to 
savor their victory. Then with 10 
seconds to go, the team stood up 
on the bench and counted down 
the final seconds. At the final 
buzzer, Lightner and Seidl gave 
each other a big hug and after the
tionals.
The first day of the champion
ships was highlighted by the 
performances of three freshmen. 
For the men, Brian Zimmerman 
won the 500 freestyle with a time 
of 4:39, not only breaking a school 
record, but qualifying for Nation
als as well. For the women, Jo 
Wollschlaeger set a school record 
in the 200 individual medley with 
a time of 2:14.9, which was good 
enough for third place. A tenth 
place finish in the 500 freestyle, 
in 5:28.5 minutes by Glynis Frost 
broke another school record.
The second day proved to be 
about as exciting as the first. In
ceremonial handshake, the team 
gathered at the bench and chanted 
P-A-C!!,P-A-C!!
With about five minutes left to 
go, it was hard to believe that we 
had finally won it, said Lightner.
With their deep bench, the Lady 
Tartans made substitutions and 
tired out the Lady Cats, who had 
problems staying with Carnegie 
Mellon in the half-court game. 
Thiel committed 34 turnovers, but 
pressure defense forced 26 CMU 
miscues.
According to Lightner, the 
team has been able to stay rela
tively injury-free. Part of the 
reason has been the depth of our

The Lady Tartans 
were deadly from the 
charity stripe, hitting 
eight of nine in the first 
half, and adding an
other 11 of 14 in the 
second stanza for 83 
percent accuracy. 
Carnegie Mellon also 
outrebounded the 
Lady Cats, 58-48, in the game.
For the game, the Lady Tartans 
were paced by Virgins 14 points, 
while Reber added 12 tallies, 
Chorgo 10 points and 12 rebounds, 
and nine points each from Light
ner and freshman guard Heather 
ODonnell. The Lady Cats were 
led by Deb Bratcher, who scored 
20 points, while Tracey Ralph 
added 19 points and 16 rebounds.
The Lady Tartans let down their 
guard when they traveled to Grove 
City for a game against the Lady 
Wolverines last Wednesday night. 
This led to a stunning 62-61 up
set, which kept Grove Citys slim 
PAC title hopes alive.
Grove City pulled out to an early 
9-0 lead and the Lady Tartans 
had to play catchup right from 
the start. By halftime, Carnegie 
Mellon had tied the game, but

At the start of the week, it 
seemed as if the Tartans luck 
was getting better. Co-captain 
Darryl Long returned from a knee 
injury, a big game against Presi
dents Athletic Conference (PAC) 
leaders, the Grove City Wolver
ines, and a home game against 
last place Thiel were on schedule.
However, the Grove City game 
was put out of CMUs hands by a 
questionable officiating call, Thiel 
managed to sneak away with an 
overtime victory, and CMU ended 
up 0-2 on the week, with the rest 
of their season on the road.
The Thiel loss was the last home 
game of the season for the team 
and for seniors Daren Moffatt, 
Darryl Long, and David Sikora. 
They were honored for their ca
reers at Carnegie Mellon before 
the game. It would have been nice 
to send them off with a win. In
stead, fans watched the Tartans 
blow four point leads in regula
tion and in overtime lose 81-79.
Both teams looked rather slug
gish when the game started. For 
the first four minutes of the con
test, the teams traded missed
what has gotten the team into 
trouble more times than anything 
else had crept into the scene: fouls. 
The Lady Tartans were also vic
timized with a collective 9-34 from 
the field in the first half, but were 
suprisingly still in the game.
In the start of the second half, 
Carnegie Mellon came out quickly, 
opening up a nine point lead with 
13:38 to go on a basket by Chorgo. 
The Lady Tartans' lead hovered 
between five and nine points until 
Grove City pulled together to 
make a run with 4:30 remaining 
in regulation.
shots with an occasional score, 
but the Tartans managed to pull 
ahead 8-3. Then the teams got 
rolling, exchanging runs of six to 
eight points; the lead changing 
hands several times.
By the halfway point of the first 
half, it seemed that Carnegie 
Mellon, holding a four point lead 
and playing strong defense, was 
finally in control of the game, but 
Thiel scrambled back into the lead 
behind the strong inside play of 
center Erik Bielata and the out
side shooting of Mike Ross. Ross 
would not only be the games high 
scorer with 25 points, but would 
also play a major role in the out
come of the game.
Thiels lead was only a tempo
rary setback as the Tartans pulled 
back into the lead behind the play 
of Moffatt, who had a game high 
of 11 rebounds, and Long, who 
would end up as CMUs leading 
scorer with 18 points.
The Tartans gave the fans a 
preview of what was to come as 
they gave up a 4 point lead, and 
went to the locker room at 
halftime, trailing 32-30. The game 
showed promise for Carnegie 
Mellon because Thiel had several 
players in foul trouble, the most
minutes, the Wolverines rattled 
off nine straight points, while 
CMUs Chorgo and Reber fouled 
out of the game. The score w^nt 
from 59-51 Tartans to 60-159 
Wolverines. . !
It was a well coached game. 
We just didnt shoot well, and 'we 
executed poorly,commented 
Lightner. She also said that it 
was the first time that the team 
had seen the extended zone on 
defense.

important of which was Bielata, 
who had three personals.  :
For the first five minutes of the 
second half, the teams battled 
back and forth. CMU began to 
pull away on a pair of three point
ers by freshman guard Chris 
Dobbs and the inability of Bie
lata, playing with four fouls, to 
play any real defense. Despite 
three pointers from Ross and 
guard Bill Deeley, the Tartans 
widened their lead to 60-52 with 
six and a half minutes left to play.
Thiel began a run led by the 
shooting of Jesse Bone. Tlhe 
Tomcats seemed to have the Tar
tans under control until Bielata 
fouled out with just under rive 
minutes remaining and CfylU 
holding a narrow 60-58 lead. T]he 
teams then traded baskets dotyn 
the stretch until, with just 44 
seconds left, Darryl Long came 
through with a slam that ener
gized the crowd and stretched the 
Tartan lead to four points. How
ever, baskets by Bone and Pat 
Parra forced the game to over
time with the score knotted at 73.
In overtime, Carnegie Mellon 
once again pulled out to a four 
point lead and stayed in front.

Ending two weeks of frustra
tion, the Carnegie Mellon 
Hockey club finally clinched an 
elusive play-off spot by explod-, 
ing for nine goals against Slip
pery Rock University (SRU) last 
Saturday, and earning six more 
in its win against Indiana Uni
versity of PA (IUP) last Sun
day. With the 9-6 and 6-3 victo
ries, the Tartans improved to 7-
3-2 in the Western Pennsylva
nia College Hockey Association 
(WPCHA), and clinched second
place. This gives the Tartans 
the right to meet the third place 
IUP Apaches in the first round 
of the play-offs next Saturday 
in Kittaning.
After struggling for most of 
the second half of the season, 
the Tartans exploded on offense 
against Slippery Rock. They 
were led by junior right wing 
Chris Galvin, who had a hat 
trick, and three assists apiece 
from tri-captain Todd Hender
son, a junior center, and fresh
man right wing Ed Kilduff.

laeger, Frost, Melissa Van 
Royen and Debbie Madsen. 
Their collective effort ended in 
time of 4:25.3, a new school 
record.
The third and last day of the 
UAA championships was a con
tinuation of excellence for the 
fartans. Wollschlaeger made a 
good showing, placing third in 
the 200 butterfly with a time of 
2:12.4. She commented that on 
the last day, I was really tired 
and didnt swim as well. 
School records were also bro
ken by Frost and Van Royen in 
the 1650 freestyle with a time 
of 18:45.3, earning sixth place, 
and in the 200 backstroke with 
2:23.8, good enough for fifth
In the mens division, Zim
merman came in first in the 
1650 freestyle at 16:19.8 set
ting both UAA and school rec
ords, and qualifying for Nation
als. After this victory, Zimmer
man was named the meets male
Most Valuable Player.
I was hoping and praying on 
making it [qualifying for Nation
als], but I was surprised with the 
times that I got. It was the best 
competition that weve had all 
year or been ready for. A lot of 
teams in the PAC [Presidentss 
Athletic Conference] are not that 
strong in swimming. Other meets 
we were not rested for. This time 
I was ready to swim. 
Senior Greg Schooley kept the 
freshmen from swimming away 
with all of the honors by placing 
first in the 200 butterfly with a 
time of 1:57. He qualified for 
Nationals for the second year in a 
row with this win. Schooley was 
an Honorable Mention All Ameri
can in the 200 butterfly last year.
According to Wollschlaeger, 
the best swims were on the last 
day. She felt that Head Coach 
Jim Perkins didnt have the teams 
as rested as they could have been. 
Therefore, there was not a lot of 
speed, so they did better on the 
longer swims.
Perkins was pleased with his 
teams performances. We had 
a lot of great swims. The men 
were in a close battle with 
Washington University, but we 
beat them because we had the 
diving points and we swam 
well.
Wollschlaeger, Zimmerman 
and Schooley will be represent
ing Carnegie Mellon at the 
NCAANational Championship 
meets in mid-March. When 
asked about the number of 
people going to these meets, 
Perkins commented that this 
has been the first time in re
cent history that more than 
two individuals qualified for 
the meets from CMU.
This week, the swimmers 
travel to Washington and Jef
ferson College for the PAC 
Championships. According to 
Perkins, the PAC meets will be 
close between the Carnegie 
Mellon teams, the men of Grove 
City, and the women of John 
Carroll University.
CIA picks up win in IM basketball; 
Theta Xi beats ATO in floor hockey
By KEVIN BARNEY
Tartan Staffwriter
Last Wednesday in the IM 
minors league of basketball, second-ranked CIA (4-0) went up 
against and defeated third-ranked 
Blue Thunder (3-1), 41-39.
CIA opened the first period with 
six points in the first two minutes 
of the game and extended its lead 
to nine points before Blue Thun
der could put a point on the score
board. The period ended with CIA 
in the lead, 13-8.
Blue Thunder started to rumble 
in the second period, and cut the 
CIA lead down to two. Despite the 
efforts of Blue Thunder, CIA 
managed to hold a slim lead 
throughout the quarter. At the 
half, CIA held a three point mar
gin, 22-19.
In the third period, the game 
became more intense, and the 
referees had to stop what would 
have resulted in a fight. Play was 
suspended until both teams cooled 
their tempers. After the time-out, 
Blue Thunder took over the lead 
for the first time in the contest,
25-24. Moments later, Len ONeil
scored for CIA, putting his team 
back on top. CIA added two more 
points before the period ended.
In the final minutes of the fourth 
quarter, Blue Thunder came back 
within a point. However, with 20 
seconds left, Goesky, their high 
scorer with 25 points, fouled out 
of the game.
CIA tried to run down the clock 
to preserve its two point lead when 
a team member was called for a 
foul. Blue Thunders Jim Burkman stepped up to the foul line 
with his teams last chance. He 
made both shots, tying the game 
at 39 with nine seconds to go. 
Dave Lee of CIA made the gamewinning jump shot with three 
ticks of the clock remaining.
The IM floor hockey season 
started last week with a game 
that was not decided until the 
final minutes of the contest. The 
ATO Cross-Checks lost to Theta 
Xi-A, 5-3, in Thistle Hall.
Theta Xi started the game by 
pressuring the ATO goalie who, 
in the first minutes of the game,
blocked five shots on goal. Both
teams played well defensively; 
only one goal was scored injthe 
entire period. ATOs Todd Sue.hr 
scored from ten feet out atlifre 
three minute mark. ,, v,:
For the first five minutes of the 
second period, the puck did not. 
come near the Theta Xi goal. When 
ATO finally penetrated into their 
zone to get off a shot, Theta Xis 
Michael MacGuire stole the puck 
and scored his first goal. Minutes 
later, Sean Evanovich scored .to 
give Theta Xi the lead, 2-1.
ATO tied the game on a goal .by 
Doug Cervenak, resulting from 
the ATO offense drawing the 
Theta Xi goalie out of his box. The 
game remained tied at two when 
the second period ended.
Theta Xi opened the third pe
riod with a goal by Chris Smith. 
About six minutes later, Theta Xi 
scored again, to take a two point 
lead, 4-2. With 1:12 left in the 
game, John Indy Jones scored 
for ATO, but MacGuire wrapped 
up the game for Theta Xi with-his, 
second goal 25 seconds later.

leir lead slipped to two on anler basket by Parra. After a 
liel timeout with 1:18 left, Ross

it Thiel up by one, 80-79, with 
seconds to go. The Tartans had 
lough time to get one last shot, 
It, with only five seconds on the

iffatt, who was going for a loose
11. Bone proceeded to hit one of 
0w free throws, and Darryl Longs 
lfcourt attempt went wide, 
iying Thiel a 81-79 victory.
The game against Thiel was the 
:ond setback of the week for the 
rtans, who lost to Grove City, 
-54, in a game which pitted the 
) two teams in the PAC.
DMU was struggling early, but 
maged to hold within a basket 
| much of the first half. Came| Mellon shot ineffectively from 
]e outside, and the Wolverines 
lened their lead to seven points 
in the first half. Grove City 
in had a cold streak of its own, 
[d the Tartans were able to close 
lead to two points at halftime, 
[27.
'he second half saw Grove City 
je up the lead early, but then 
:e it right back behind the 
mg play of Joe Buckley. Buck1, PAC Player of the Week from 
By previous week, led all scorers
with 26 points, didnt commit a 
personal foul, and played a very 
strong defensive game.
CMU was able to keep pace for 
most of the second half, never 
falling behind by more than five, 
until the game took a severe turn 
for the worse. With about six 
minutes remaining, a highly ques
tionable foul call on Daren Moffatt, combined with a technical 
foul on Darryl Long, turned a 
close game into a minor rout.
The tempers of both teams, 
already strained, began to boil 
over, and the game appeared to 
be on the verge of becoming a 
replay of the last meeting of these 
teams, which was marred by 
fights and a total of 57 fouls be
tween the teams.
One highlight was the return of 
Darryl Long after missing a week 
with a knee injury. He led the 
Tartans in scoring for both games, 
scoring 14 against Grove City, 
and 18 against Thiel. He also 
played solid defense and re
bounded well, picking up 17 re
bounds over the two games.
Next week: The Tartans (7-15; 
5-5 PAC) hit for the road to finish 
the season with games against 
Washington & Jefferson on Tues
day, Bethany on Thursday, and 
the season finale against Emory 
University on Sunday.

graduate student Neil Smith at 
center, and Dave Pfalzgraf at 
left wing.
Frey was quick to note that 
despite allowing six goals, most 
of which were given up by the 
defense, junior John Kerber 
played well in the net.
It was a wide open game from 
the start. We went the first four 
or five minutes without a 
whistle, commented Frey.
The Tartans started the ac
tion early on, opening a 3-1 lead 
after one period, then explod
ing for four second period goals. 
Frey displayed some of the 
teams enthusiasm.
Hopefully, coming off this big 
win well do well against IUP 
and clinch second place. After 
watching the guys play so well 
I cant wait to get back on the 
ice.

ried over into Sundays game

the first period.
Within a minute and a half, 
into the second period, IUP took 
a 1-0 lead on a power play goal. 
Four minutes later, CMUs 
Dave Collins, assisted by Smith,, 
tied the game with a power play, 
goal. Each team scored again 
before the period ended.
The third period belonged; tfl 
the Tartans. Pfalzgraf scored 
35 seconds after the period 
started to give Carnegie Mellow 
a lead it would never relinquish.. 
At the 7:19 mark, Henderson 
had an unassisted goal, and at', 
10:01, Smith put in another goal, 
with an assist from Galvin. 
Randy Walter put the final point 
on the scoreboard for CMU with 
his first goal of the year. He was 
assisted by Adam Dermardosian. IUP scored once more late 
in the period, but it was not 
enough. The Tartans won, 6-3.
Freshman goalie Dave Sealfon was named WRCT Player of 
the Game. He faced 35 shots on 
goal and saved 32 of them.
With a WPCHA play-off spot 
now wrapped up, the Tartans 
are looking forward to a pos
sible rematch with Pitt, and 
another shot at the league titlfi.

ast Monday night, the Lady 
tans faced what was supposed 
,e the challenge of their seaThe Allegheny Gators (17-6)
have been to the NCAA playoffs 
six out of the last seven years. 
Despite a nailbiting first half, 
CMU handed the Gators a 73-58 
loss.
The Lady Tartans took an early 
lead, springing out to an eight 
point bulge in the first seven 
minutes, but Allegheny was able 
to keep pace, and with 9:31 to go, 
tied the game on two consecutive 
hoops from Veronica Bohm. Seidl 
called a timeout to discuss strat
egy. It seemed like Allegheny was 
listening in, running out to a six 
point lead after the timeout. But 
the Lady Tartans were able to 
catch up with the Gators by 
halftime. With only one second 
remaining in the half, Beth Vir
gin sunk a 13-footer to tie the 
game at 37.
The second half was all CMU. 
The team opened up the second 
half with a 13-2 run and never 
looked back. They outscored the 
Gators 36-21 in the second 20 
minutes, and shot 11 of 23 (48%) 
from the floor. Lightner figured 
high in the scoring with a gamehigh 20 points. Chorgo had an
other big game with 14 points and 
seven boards, while Smith and 
Buxbaum each had eight points.
Allegheny was led by Carson
Slades 12 points and Cindy 
Kylers 12 rebounds and eight 
points. Michelle Brown also scored
10 points. The Gators turned the 
ball over 28 times to the relent
less Lady Tartan press. The dif
ference in the game was that CMU 
was given 30 free throw opportu
nities which they converted into
17 points.
This week: The Lady Tartans 
will close out the 1988-89 regular 
season at Washington and Jeffer
son College tonight, starting at 
5:30 pm and broadcast on WRCT 
(88.3 FM). The first time these 
two teams met at Skibo Gym, the 
Lady Tartans crushed the First 
Ladies, 63-47.
By tipoff tonight, the regional 
polls will be out, and the Lady 
Tartans will know for sure if their 
one point loss is enough to knock 
them out of an NCAA play-off 
berth. If the Lady Tartans drop 
below fourth in the region and 
have an impressive showing at 
W&J, there will still be a chance 
that their season could be ex
tended into March.
Before the season, Seidl said 
that it would take 20 wins to make 
the play-offs; the best record the 
Lady Tartans could have at the 
end of their season is 19-6.

Look out for runaway trays!photo by Andy Gillespie
Tray and rider tumble along.photo by Mike Kirscht
\y KEVIN BARNEY
'artan Staffwriter
right of the basketball court is the slower 
and longer run of the two. On the left 
side of the basketball court, the other 
run is much faster and a little shorter. 
The left side is the more exciting of the 
two.
Last February, a group of students, 
inspired by the Olympic event of luging, 
created a new and much faster method of 
traying.
The New Method of traying involves 
using two trays instead of one. The 
trayer places the first tray underneath 
his stomach and puts the second tray 
under his knees.
Propulsion is the same, by reaching 
forward with your arms and dragging 
yourself and the two trays along. When 
you reach a high speed,you pull in your 
arms and interlock your hands behind 
your back.
This Luge Method can yield incred
ible speeds when done properly.
In order to steer while using the Luge 
Method, you have to lean to one side or
the other. m
To exe
cute a 
sharp
turn, you ---------------------------------------------------
must put your arm out and drag it along 
in the snow.
If you make the turn too sharp, the 
trays will shift beneath you, sending you 
flying through the air.
As a comparison of the two methods, 
on a good run on Flagstaff Hill using the 
traditional method of traying you would 
ride to the basketball court, while the 
Luge Method would propel you into the 
road at the bottom of the hill.
Once youve mastered Flagstaff,you 
will desire faster and longer traying runs. 
Several guarenteed memorable traying 
runs can be found at the Scheneley Golf 
Course.
The longest runto be found begins at 
the top of the hill near the apartment 
building next to the gym  you know, 
near the building where Mr. Rogers sup
photo by Andy Gillespie 
throughout Scheneley Park and the golf 
course. All you have to do is find the ones 
steep enough to be fun.
Surprisingly, University Dining Serv
ice doesnt mind the use of their trays for 
this kind of activity  provided the stu
dents leave the trays in a place where 
we can get them.
Since the beginning of last semester 
to February 1, 1989, 1283 trays have 
been stolen or lost from UDS establish
ments.
At a cost of $3.61 for each tray, a little; 
over $4600 worth of trays will have to be; 
replaced for next semester.
The money to replace the trays will be' 
figured into the prices of next semesters 
meal plans.
So, if you use the trays for traying or 
whatever else you would use a tray for, 
make sure iteventually finds its way 
back to one of the fine UDS establish
ments.
posedly
lives.
--------------------------------------------------- This hill
does contain obstacles such as trees, 
low-hanging branches, rocks, tree 
stumps, and an abrupt finish.
A disadvantage is that you cant get 
much more speed than on Flagstaff, 
since a lot of your kinetic energy is 
wasted in avoiding the obstacles you 
face on the hill.
For a fast but short run, you have to 
travel farther into tKe golf course, about 
a hundred yards from the long hill.
The hill starts out steep, then flattens 
suddenly as you go across one of the golf 
courses putting greens. After the put
ting green there is a short but steep 
drop-off.
There are, of course, plenty of other 
hills that can be used for traying
One of the few remaining legal tradiions open to todays Carnegie Mellon 
tudent is traying.
Traying involves borrowing a tray 
rom one of the University Dining Servces establishments, waiting for a heavy 
nowfall, and finally riding the tray 
lown the nearest hill.
The Traditional Method for traying is 
itting on one tray Indian style or on 
our stomache.
Steering is attempted by either outtretching your arms like wings or by 
lolding onto the tray and leaning to one 
ide or the other.
This Method usually results in a bout 
f wild spinning that ends up catepulting 
he rider into the snow.
Flagstaff is traditionally The Hill, 
'here are essentially two different runs 
n Flagstaff.
From the top of the hill, the run to the

Barbies curse: Will it claim Ken?
The world is in entropy. And I 
dont mean the spacious, conven
iently located general store in the 
lower depths of our own Skibo 
Hall. What lam referring to is the 
fact that the world in which we 
live in has started to show its age 
in the most unlikely places. Re
cently, that paragon of rapportage known as the USA Today ran 
the stirring headline Barbie 
Turns Thirty  Through Face 
Lifts, Changing Hairdos and Ac
cessories, Shes Still the Queen of 
Dolls!
What hot blooded American boy 
didnt cast a longing gaze at his 
sisters Barbie dolls and hope that 
someday he would meet his own 
Barbie Doll, preferably in his own 
shape and size? It is because of 
this mystique surrounding the 
Barbie Doll that I feel it is neces
sary to tell the full story of this 
Paging, but salient symbol of 
America.
; Now, I realize that most people 
[wouldnt want to have this publi
cized, but when did Barbie have 
;this facelift? I never noticed it. I 
realize that not noticing the fact 
a facelift has taken place is 
the point behind getting a facelift, 
but as a child growing up in the 
seventies, picking up the occa
sional Barbie Doll (usually by the 
;hair, an action which was fol
lowed by swinging it over my head 
'lasso-style, eliciting cries of rage 
, from the dolls proprietors), I never
 stopped and said to myself Boy, 
this Barbie Doll is starting to get 
wrinkles on her forehead .... bet
ter call a plastic surgeon.
; The truth is that Barbie has 
;had several facelifts in her thirty 
lyears, all of them so competent 
and subtle that she has been able 
to walk through the decades look
ing as resplendent as ever; I hope 
I look that good after so many 
years and major operations.
Although Barbies medical his
tory is somewhat of a mystery, 
there are other, more ominous 
aspects to her existence. Consider 
the high mortality rate amongst 
her friends. The most salient 
example of what has come to be
known as The Curse of the Bar
bie Doll, is the enigma surround
ing Barbies friend Francie. Dur
ing the sixties, Francie was Bar
bies more radical counterpart. As 
opposed to the wedding dresses
and wholesomely unrevealing 
bathing suits, for which Barbie 
had gained renown, Francies 
taste ran toward tie dyes and bell 
bottoms.
As the sixties drew to a close, 
Francie disappeared without a 
trace. Her whereabouts are still 
unknown. Sometheoristssaythat 
Francie was killed during a pro
test at Berkeley, others contend 
that the executives at the Mattel 
Corporation grew increasingly 
embarrassed with her wild be
havior (after all, Francie was the 
proprietor of the infamous Mood 
A Go-Go Bedroom Playset) and 
had her terminated by a team of 
corporate hit men.
But Francie is not the only one 
of Barbies friends who has disap
peared through time. Glancing 
into Barbies immediate circle of 
friends is like glancing into a vast 
necropolis. I often stay up nights 
wondering whatever happened to 
characters such as Midge and 
Skipper, Barbies friends from the 
fifties.
Being attached to a curse such 
as this one has probably left some 
sort of an emotional scar on Bar
bie. I understand that Mattel is about 
to give her a new friend, a young, 
lively little number named Nikki. In 
her promotional pictures, Nikki is 
shown with her arms around the Ken 
doll. This reckless behavior is defi
nitely a bad sign  I give her two, 
three years, tops.
Another disturbing aspect of the 
Barbie legend is her source of income. 
Over the years, Barbie has been la
beled as a Superstar, a Solo In The 
Spotlight girl, and even a Live Ac
tion woman, but her exact occupa
tion has always been surrounded in a 
haze of uncertainty.
Of course, Barbie has always been 
notorious for her conspicuous con
sumption of goods. Over the thirty 
years of her existence, Barbie has had 
several Corvettes (one pink, one yel
low, one remote controlled), a Dream 
House, a Dream Pool, her very own 
Cruise Ship, and a private plane 
known as the Barbie Friendship.
There is much more I have not 
mentioned, a dazzling array of Barbie 
merchandice including wallets, alarm 
clocks, and wall safes and, most im
portantly, Barbies legendary ward
robe.
Perhaps Barbies legendary ward
robe can furnish us with some clues as 
to exactly what it is that she does to 
maintain her legendary Jet Set life
style. Over ten Barbie wedding dresses 
have been manufactured in the thirty 
years in which she has been amongst 
us. Is it possible that Barbie has gained 
her fortune by romancing, and conse
quently draining the finances many 
men who have worshipped her over 
the years? I dont like to think so, 
particularly since Barbies true love, 
Ken, has already appeared as the 
Here Comes The Groom Ken. 
Hopefully Barbie will take the hint 
and abandon her loose ways for wed
ded bliss with the one who loves her 
most.
Of course, there are certain natural 
signs of maturity which the Barbie 
Doll has been spared. For example, 
Im still looking forward to the day 
when the Maternity Barbie comes 
out. Maybe the appearance of the 
Maternity Barbie will be infinitely 
delayed by the fact that Ken is

Music merges majors
By CARLOS FRANCO
Tartan Assistant Features Editor
I It wasn't really cancelled. It 
-was consolidated into the regular 
voice major, commented voice 
m^jor Christie Noll on the deci
sion arrived at by the Music 
^Department last semester to 
eliminate the music theater voice 
jnajor.
' The two majors differ in that 
music theater voice experiences 
more contemporary musical rep
ertoire while voice deals more with 
classical material. The two ma
jors also differed in the course re
quirements.
Noll wasnt really upset by the 
Music Departments decision. She 
stated, A lot of people left be
cause itwasntforthem. Imgoing 
to finish up here.
; Other students, however, were 
indignant about what happened 
to the music theater voice pro
gram.
Sophomore voice major Nicolle 
Feigin is one such student. She 
says, I dont get any satisfaction 
out of classical.
| Other students agreed with 
Feigins feelings about the depart
ments decision. The junior class 
Was cut almost in half and a lot of 
Sophomores didnt come back, 
said Feigin
 Feigin said that she has already 
transferred schools once and has 
no desire to leave, although she 
is upset about the decision to con
solidate majors.
; Sophomore music theater voice 
major Hugh Rial feels differently 
about remaining in the depart
ment after the consolidation.
When asked about the decision 
to drop the music theater voice 
major, Rial stated, Well if you 
ask [the administration] about it 
they didnt cancel our major.
. Rial is leaving CMU at the end 
<5f the year. He feels that there are 
a lot of problems with the situ
ation and theres really no way to 
change it.
 Rial went on to say, I dont sing

aMPnra ʔnPg uymnk"na:
Dear Zazz,
I recently received a mail
ing from Dr. Murray Nor
ris, president of a group 
known as Christian Re
newal.
His letter began: Just 
when you thought your chil
dren were safe from homo
sexual advances, Congress 
introduces House Resolu
tion 709  The Gay Bill of 
Rights.
Homosexuality is not 
going to go away, he con
tinued, until you take an 
official stand on the issue.
, His mailing terrifies me.
Why do people who preach 
prejudice think they are 
more Christian than the 
poor souls who bear the 
brunt of that hatred?
If homosexuals cant live 
in our neighborhoods, nor 
earn a living in our work 
place, what is to become of 
them?
You may not be able to 
answer my questions, Zazz.
But you can speak out for 
compassion and under
standing.
You offer a moderate voice 
to thousands of readers. I 
hope some are listening.
 P.H.
Dear P.H.,
The Christian Family Re
newal mailing is indeed 
frightening.
Substitute Jew for the 
word homosexual in this 
letter, and it could have been 
written a half-century ago 
by the hatemongers in Nazi 
Germany.
H.R. 709 is designed to 
provide equal rights for 
homosexuals in such areas 
as housing and employ
ment.
Many states already have simi
lar laws: H.R. 709 calls for equal 
rights nationally.
Norris is fueling the fears of 
people who are paranoid, unin
formed, or homophobic. He sugMaryland postmark.
His profane rantings and sick 
illustrations are just about the 
scariest mail I receive.
Even when I write about 
innocent children with AIDS, 
this reader scrawls pervertlover or sodomite-defender" 
across the columns and mails 
them back to me.
I suspect Ill hear from him 
after todays column.
Christian Family Renewal al
ready has a ready-made con
stituency of people like this 
Maryland man. Norris now 
wants to enlist other Con
cerned Americans.
My advice: If youre concerned 
about H.R. 709, contact your 
congresspersons office. But 
Norris, as a preacher of hate, is 
not the right leader for your
gests that H.R. 709 seeks to per
mit homosexuals the legal right 
to sodomize our children.
Sexual abuse of children, of 
course, is as much a heterosexual 
problem as a homosexual one.
But to read Norris propaganda, 
youd thing the government wants 
to allow gays to flaunt their per
verted lifestyle on kids every
where. Its a total distortion of 
the resolution.
No matter what your views 
might be on the morality of homo
sexuality, the idea of treating 
homosexuals as second-class citi
zens is morally wrong and to
tally contrary to the U.S. 
Constitution.
The gay-rights issue is a vola
tile one. I know. In my job, I see 
the depths of homophobia.
For instance, whenever I print 
a letter from or about homosexu
als, I invariably receive an anony
mous hate letter from a certain 
reader whose envelopes bear a
Dear Zazz,
Regarding your columns on 
revenge: I am part Cherokee, 
and the Great Spirit reminds 
me, The man who will not for
give destroys the bridge over 
which he, eventually, must
Also, a relative of mine was a 
Cherokee medicine man. He 
said, Revenge is a poison with 
two close and powerful relatives: 
Hate and Anger. If these three 
occupy the mind long enough, 
they will eventually manifest 
themselves in the body in the 
form of a disease. Therefore, 
revenge delivers its own pun
ishment.

any classical music, and I didnt 
expect to take any of the lan
guages when I got here. After he 
found out that he would have to 
take languages and sing classi
cal, Rial commented, I felt I was 
lied to.
I stayed when they fired Joel 
Thome, commented Rial, because 
he felt things might improve, but 
he now feels that nothing has 
changed.
Associate Music Professor 
Ralph Zitterbart feels positive 
about the departments decision 
two majors.
Zitterbart explained that today 
there is a trend towards a person 
who is able to deal in both genres 
[classical and contemporary] 
successfully, and he feels the 
rationale behind the change is to 
make music majors flexible 
enough to deal in more than one 
genre.
According to Zitterbart, the 
music majors need to take classes 
that will prepare them for their 
singing careers. For example, the 
acting classes that voice majors 
take are different than regular 
acting classes.
Zitterbart explained the acting 
classes are geared towards sing
ers because there are certain 
things that actors and singers do, 
have to be integrated in a differ
ent way.
The preparation and broad 
background now required is for 
the choice that Zitterbart feels 
that students will make.
Most people will make a choice. 
For most young people opera is a 
later choice, explained Zitterbart, 
buthe feels that a classical reper
toire should be required so stu
dents are able to make the choice 
later on. The new program is de
scribed by Zitterbart as realistic 
and difficult.
There is no doubt that it puts 
demands on students to function 
in two genres, but as I look at the 
world it [the new program] is 
realistic, offered Zitterbart in 
closing.

Tartan Staffwriter
Kurt Vonnegut, famous author of 
Slaughterhouse Five, Cats Cradle, and 
Sirens of Titan, spoke at Carnegie Music 
Hall last week. He entitled his speech 
How to Get a Job Like Mine.
Vonnegut entertained an audience 
made up mostly of Carnegie Mellon and 
Pitt students. He apologized if he was re
peating himself from former lectures, 
saying, Even Jesus Christ would have 
started repeating himself if he hadnt 
been crucified.
To the amusement of the Carnegie 
Mellon members of the audience, Von
negut sang the Carnegie Tech theme 
from the late 30s. As it turns out, he 
failed out of Carnegie Tech after a year 
as an engineering major before going on
to study chemistry at Cornell. Thermo 
did me in, he announced to loud cheers 
from Carnegie Mellon students.
Apparently some things havent 
changed. His only other confession was 
made later on in his speech  Geraldo 
Rivera was once my son-in-law. 
Vonnegut urged the audience to join 
the American Civil Liberties Union, an 
organization that upholds the Bill of 
Rights.
Vonnegut was very vocal in areas of 
politics and the environment, asking, 
When are we going to stop choosing 
abysmally ignorant optimists for posi
tions of leadership?
Not one to be caught empty-handed, 
Vonnegut even read the inaugural speech 
that he had written in case he was elected 
President.
As an alternative to Star Wars, he
proposed juvenile deliquents be put in 
an open field with Atari video games 
with the top removed and a pocket full of 
quarters.
According to Vonnegut, America is only 
now becoming a country of liberty. Bos
ton and Philadelphia were only the 
motels of liberty.
He cheered the decline of racism and 
sexism, despite the two hundred year 
delay. He cautioned, however, that they 
could appear again at any time.
Vonnegut also shared a message he 
had written to the people one hundred 
years in the future. He reminded them 
not to fall prey to the wasteful use of the 
environment that has caused so much 
trouble in the present century.
Vonnegut also had some advice for 
beginning writers.
Using his psychic powers he advised
one writer to throw away the first four 
pages... Thatway, when the readerstarts, 
the storys already going 60 miles per 
hour and he has to run to catch up with 
it, and that your (story) is one charac
ter short.
You have to make your characters 
bounce around. You cant let them lie 
around like nose putty. You need Iago.
He topped off his speech by drawing 
plotlines of familiar stories, such as Cinderalla, Hamlet, and The Metmorphosis 
on a graph using bad-good and beginning-end. When real life starts to follow 
the dramatic flux of the sine graph of 
most stories, he advised, you need help.
Vonneguts speech was interesting, 
informative, and funny. No doubt many 
of the audience left the music hall as 
fans. If he ever returns to Pittsburgh, 
dont miss it.

n the future: Barbie juggles career and family?
fyrfy$T0 Gtbg AiaT Ox
o...well...underequipped, but 
hen again, Barbie is not known 
s being the most complete woman 
l the block either.
There might be other reasons 
ir the delay in the appearance of 
he Maternity Barbie; we may 
ave to wait until the Career 
iarbie finally makes her appearnce, followed, of course, by the 
Executive Ken doll.
If this is to happen, Barbies 
'ademark Corvette may be re
laced by a pink SAAB 900 turbo. 
In any event, as Barbie nears 
lirty, it has become painfully 
bvious that her tiny biological
clock is ticking away at an accel
erated pace.
Perhaps the time has come for 
the celebrated Barbie to make 
her choice between career and 
family.
Barbie is and has been the 
embodiment of the American suc
cess story, a woman who has had 
everything: stardom, looks and 
wealth, and has never made any 
apologies for it.
May she age gracefully; now 
that the children of the genera
tion that was first introduced to 
the Barbie doll are at an age com
parable to that of the Barbie her
self, I think it would be only fit
ting that the powers-that-be at 
Mattel Toys consent to allow Bar
bie to age at the same rate as 
those people who first played 
with her when they were growing 
up.
In thirty years we can have a 
Grandma Barbie, with a matronly 
figure more akin to that of Bar
bara Bush but with the same 
eclectic style and zest for life.
In forty years we can look for
ward to the Geriatric Barbie, 
complete with a Barbie walker 
and enema bag and eventually, 
Barbie will join her friends in the 
Barbie Dream Mausoleum.
Call me a hopeless romantic,
but I know that someday we will 
all find that Barbie or Ken doll we 
have always been waiting for, and 
I know that none of us would like 
to wake up fifty years from today 
with a drained savings account 
and a monolithic plastic surgery 
bill.

extremely hopeful to jaded and

taking the job search process and 
their Professional Choice seriously, were decked out in suits

Many of these services require 
that you be registered with the 
office, a process involving filling 
out a form and giving the Career

resume to keep on file.
By registering, a student en
sures that his resume resides in a 
summer resume book; he may be 
referred to and is eligable to in

According to Manusco, around 
1100 students are already regis

will eventually register.
Manusco also recommends that 
students utilize any resources, 
including contacts or previous

On January 29, the 
CMU Navy ROTC fin
ished second out of 
eight teams in a ROTC 
drill meet held at 
Northwestern Univer
sity in Evanston, Illi
nois.
The CMU team took 
second place in the pla
toon standard event.
The event is a march
ing and rifle event.
Each of the platoon 
standard teams has twelve to 
sixteen members who march in 
formation and execute intricate 
rifle movements.
Each team is ranked accord
ing to how it executes marching 
formations and how well it exe
cutes rifle maneuvers.
The rifle maneuvers are exe
cuted with modified M-l gerrands. Modified means the fir
ing pins have been taken out of 
the rifles.
The squad standard event is 
the same as the platoon stan
dard event except that only six 
to eight people compete.
The third event is color guard. 
Color guard consists of four to 
six people who present both the 
national flag and the Marine 
standard.
The color guard performs a 
series of intricate marching and 
flag movements. The event is 
difficult because the ROTC mid
shipmen cannot cross the flags.
The final team event held at 
the Northwestern competition 
is trick. The trick event is where 
the midshipmen perform free
style rifle events like spinning

and tossing the rifle in the air. . ;
Carnegie Mellon Navy ROTC - 
was not able to compete in trick  
because at the time of the meet  
it had no trick team.
In the only individual event, 
individual knock out, entrants 
are judged on their skill in exe
cuting rifle maneuvers. Sopho
more Mark Schaeffer took sixth 
place in individual knock out 
at Northwestern.
The ROTC drill team was 
started at the beginning of the 
fall semester, and previously 
only competed at a Cornell Uni
versity meet. At Cornell, 
Schaeffer took first place in 
the individual knock out.
Despite only having trained 
and practiced for several 
months,the team did well  it 
finished first in the Cornell, 
meet in squad standard.
The team practiced every 
weekday morning from 6 to 8 
am, from 4 to 6:30 pm on Sat
urday, and 10 to noon on Sun
day.
ROTC has an upcoming meet 
on March 11 at Villanova Uni

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  21 February 1989L5
2www ulm" .l:a MPnPIty. y uPMla!
)ear Specs,
There are times when I am very 
jealous of my roommate. I like 
!er, but I want to kill her when I 
watch eight thousand cute guys 
follow her around.
My blood boils!
)ear Boils,
You are behaving like a 2-year>ld Othello. Not only are you exiggerating, (If eight thousand 
;ute guys paraded around this 
ampus, wed all notice!) but you 
are also insulting yourself.
I want to kill her is a sentinent left over from Paleothic 
nan. It is a terribly inconsiderite remark to make. Leave it for 
hose less fortunate than yourjelf to use. Whenever you feel it 
springing to your lips, take a monent to consider Ted Bundys po
sition today.
If this doesnt appease your hosility, consider adopting a hobby. 
Juail shooting is nice, especially 
the fall, for letting out those 
iggresssions.
While youre considering soially acceptable remarks to 
nake, remember that referring
o the condition of your blood is
not one of them. It is passe to refer 
to your digestion or whatever bio
logical system is raising the blood 
pressure. Detailing these func
tions should be reserved for 
moments you spend quietly alone 
with your physician.
Between the expansion of AIDS 
and the plethora of communicable 
diseases that abound today, it is 
best not to utter words that de
scribe personal secretions.
Dear Specs,
I cant take my mind off my girl
friend. I am very anxious that she 
will meet someone else while were 
separated over midsemester 
break. What should I do?
Worried
Dear Worried,
Many couples manage to spend 
their time apart without meeting 
anyone new. Julius Caesar, for 
example, left his girlfriend and 
went home, too. Unfortunately, 
he left his best friend with her, 
and Antony and Cleopatra be
came a famous couple.
But their case was unusual. The 
chances of you dating a girl who 
kills herself because she cant live 
without your buddy are slim. So, 
dont waste your time worrying; 
go home, have fun.
Dear Specs,
I see my ex-girlfriend all the 
time and its not very pleasant. Is 
there anything I can do to ease 
the tension?
Help
Dear Help,
Its not very pleasant to pay 
taxes, either. Going to Metropol 
for the Beaux Arts Ball probably 
wont be particularly pleasant. 
Eating oysters with sand in them 
can also be unpleasant.
However, there are things that 
just exist in their uncomfortable 
states that you have to brave. You
could probably ease the tension if 
you smile and wave, or greet her 
enthusiastically on the Cut. 
Scream How are you? when she 
gets within hearing range.
If its still unpleasant after that, 
get a pair of sunglasses and just 
pretend you dont see her at all. 
The old transparent solution is 
very popular here, so youll fit right
Dear Specs,
I have a friend who often has 
green bits of food in his teeth. How 
should I tell him?
JP
Dear JP,
When he smiles, ergo display
ing these so-called green bits, 
simply frown. Then say clearly, I 
am not amused by vulgarity! 
You may use the expression 
again if he offers to buy you lunch 
or expresses an interest in walk
ing you home.
If he gives you too fond an em
brace try saying:I am really not 
amused by vulgarity!

HANDS helps students
By A. GANSLEY-ORTIZ
Tartan Staffwriter
Drug and Alcohol Aware
ness Week began on Feb. 3 
during the Student Health 
Fair.
A local group giving out in
formation at the Fair was the 
Helpline for Alcohol and 
Drugs for and by Students 
(HANDS).
Students can call HANDS 
from 9pm to lam Sun. 
through Thurs. atx7070 and 
discuss with speciallytrained fellow students either 
their problems or the' prob
lems of friends or relatives.
The students answering 
the phones were trained by 
professional counselors who 
are also available to help 
students and to give refer
rals.
During Drug and Alcohol 
Awareness Week, profes
sional speakers gave lunch
eon lectures designed to give 
students information about 
drugs and alcohol, the dis
ease, abuse, and prevention.
Thursday night was Social 
Night at Scotland Yard, featur
ing free food and non-alcoholic 
drinks.
Finally, awards for the crea
tive writing and poster compe
titions were distributed. The 
Health Center, says Anita 
Barkin, Director of the Health 
Center, hopes to develop the 
first place poster as a promo
tional tool on campus.
Alcohol and Drug Awareness 
Week was sponsored by the 
Committee for Alcohol and 
Drug Awareness and funded 
by Funds for Improvement of 
Post-Secondary Education. The 
events mark the beginning of a 
two year program designed to 
inform students about sub
stance abuse.
The program includes an 
attempt at having AA and 
Adult Children of Alcoholics 
meetings on campus. Currently, 
students can call the Counsel
ing Center for help.
Students wishing to volun
teer for HANDS can contact 
Sandy Kryder at the Counsel
ing Center at x2922.

STEPHANIE REEDY
Staffwriter
ALittle Night Music, the Drama 
epartments latest mainstage 
oduction, opened on Saturday 
Ito a sold-out crowd that cheered 
jjjie shows success. Directed by 
Billy Wilson, A Little Night Music 
is an entertaining comedy that 
Inters around a very confused 
Kve octagon. The characters in 
tijie play are not just images on a 
green but real people, with real 
elings.
Hie play has a swarm of intiJate relationships that define the 
bt. First we have Frederik 
;erman, a middle-aged man 
fing to renew his own youth 
th his young wife, Anne; his son
Henrik, a sexually frustrated boy 
preparing for the ministry, and 
Petra, Egermans maid; Count 
Carl-Magnus Malcolm, an in
sanely jealous (of his mistress, 
not his wife) egoist, and his wife 
Charlotte; and The One And 
Only Desiree Armfeldt, a lonely, 
aging actress who hasnt seen 
Frederik, her former lover, in 14 
years, and is in the midst of an 
affair with the infamous Count 
Carl-Magnus. If it sounds confus
ing, just imagine how funny it is 
when these folks get together.
The play opens with the Liebeslieder Singers, who perform a 
musical overture which foreshad
ows what will happen in the play. 
This chorus is present through
out the play, offering comedic
commentary on the characters 
and their actions.
Act I of the play introduces the 
characters and their relationships 
to the audience. Act II takes place 
during a weekend in the country, 
in which the plots and schemes of 
jealous wives and husbands un
fold into comical events, and the 
true feelings of many of the char
acters come out in the open.
Dennis Rees does an excellent 
job in portraying Frederik Eger
man; he presents the character 
with charm and poise, and is able 
to express his sensitivity and 
sense of humor through talented 
acting and singing.
Susan J. Coon creates a very 
moving performance as Desiree, 
and despite the cliched nature of
gPktad$
the song, her version of Send J 
The Clowns was heart-wrenc 
ing and original.
Mark Lewis plays a perfect 
sexist egomaniacal Count CarlMagnus Malcolm, and uses his 
strong voice to sing In Praise Of 
Women (a song about fidelity) to 
his wife after finding another man 
with his mistress. Eileen Kaden 
is brilliant as the smart and cyni
cal Charlotte Malcolm, and unex
pectedly lets her true feelings 
come out in the beautiful song 
Every Day A Little Death. 
Jessica Pennington plays Anne 
Egerman and gives her character 
all of the frivolity, naivete, and 
silliness one would expect of an 
18 year-old virgin, while Jack 
Plotnick, who plays Henrik, is
convincing as an over-serious and 
sexually frustrated boy. His char
acter offers some of the best laughs 
in the show.
Maria Sneden, who is memo
rable as Petra, the promiscuous 
maid, gives her character a more 
serious side by giving a moving 
rendition of The Millers Son.
The show is filled with music 
and movement, with every mem
ber of the cast adding to the per
formance. The orchestra per
formed Stephen Sondheims en
chanting score with finesse and 
style, and the set, created by Dick 
Block, stirred applause in the 
second act as an entire dining 
room scene was raised out of the 
stage floor in an elevator.
The lighting (designed by Thomas Salzman) and the costumes 
(Cletus Anderson) transformed 
the stage into a late 19th century 
paradise, made even more magi; 
cal with the orchestra barely vis7 
ible behind a thin lavender screen.
A Little Night Music offers 
great evening of comedy, romance; 
singing, and dancing through 
Billy Wilsons directing and a 
talented and well-chosen cast, 
And of course, like all traditional 
musicals, it has a very happy 
ending.
A Little Night Music runs 
through March 4 in the Kresge 
Theatre in CFA. For ticket infor
mation and reservations call the 
Kresge Box Office at 268-2407; 12 
- 5, weekdays.

Even though the crowds 
werent as large as last 
year, George Gee and His 
Make-Believe Ballroom 
Orchestra swung their 
way into the Skibo Ball
room and performed one 
hell of a show Saturday 
light.
The show was sponsored 
by AB Dance, and al
though the concert/dance 
did not attract as many 
people as last year, the 
People who attended 
lidnt seem to notice.
The ballroom was deco
rated with balloons, stream
ers, and flowers, clearly 
showing the Valentines 
Day theme. About 200 
people were swinging, doing 
the Lindy, and just dancing 
their butts off to the jumpin 
jive sounds of George Gee 
and his orchestra. George 
himself was true to form, 
bouncing and bopping all 
over the place while exhort
ing the dancers and listen
ers at every opportunity. 
The Make-Believe Orches
tra itself followed Georges 
lead, swinging and swaying 
along, putting on a great 
show visually as well as 
musically.

5y_m maa mda" .gI udPtya
By DAN BIDWA
Tartan Staffwriter
The seventies are back. 
Actually, that shouldnt be 
much of a surprise to anyone. Old 
stuff is easy to market, especially 
recently old music, since every
one is still listening to it anyway 
- those new albums just slide 
right into those classic track ra~ dio formats. (Of course, this assiimes that those stations can
 stpp drooling over Rod Ste3 warts latest attempt to prove 
:2 .that he no longer has any
ability to rock out long 
enough to listen to something
 that can. Rock out, that is.)
; The Sixties were good for at
leMt two years, but the psy;! ch'edelic bit has been beaten into 
;j the;,tie-dyed ground by now, and 
;j the' mighty music marketing 
machine is hunting for a new 
; trend.
Itjust happens that the Seven; ties' were close enough to the 
Sixties for a nice smooth transi
tion of emphasis, so things are 
!j sliding into the Seventies at this
 very minute. Of course, the top 
i forty wont see the changes for a 
' year or two, or at least another
few months. Things dont break 
quickly - the whole psychedelic 
thing was bubbling around the 
i; alternative music scene for years 
;; before MTV decided that it was 
j; hip to wear paisley. Now the paisleys back in the closet (where it 
;j belongs) for everybody but the
Cynics, and MTVs got their 
American Bandstand rip-off on 
instead. This should have set off 
klaxons in the prediction centers 
of the brains of everyone. But, no, 
people were off listening to Tif
fany and Heart and Starship, and 
everybody knows how those Sa
tanic jungle rhythms warp the 
senses and dull the brain, so the 
rebirth of disco, now called house 
music, went by unnoticed.
Of course, someone had to fig
ure out what was up. Unfortu
nately, the whole affair had made 
it all the way to cock rock before 
anyone woke up and went, have
nt I heard this before? Fortu
nately, action was taken before 
things degenerated into the Carpenders, and the skid was halted 
somewhere between Led Zeppe
lin and Black Sabbath. This is not 
a bad place to be, especially since 
bands like Soundgarden and 
Mudhoney are presently splat
tering the scenery with their 
versions of the Seventies that 
dont include stuff like a bad 
Zeppelin tune or Changes, and 
do include stuff like All Your 
Lies and Mudride, a couple of 
tunes respectively off their new
albums Megamix OK and Superfuzz Bigmuff (named after a 
couple of distortion pedals, so dont 
get any stupid ideas).
Thebigrecord companies arent 
missing this stuff; they just arent 
releasing it. Yet. Case in point: 
Soundgarden moved from the 
relatively obscure Sub Pop label 
to the relatively well-known SST 
label, and their next album is 
slated for the positively gigantic 
A&M label. Its there, but it 
just takes a while for the 
good stuff to get through the 
stupid executives and the 
shitty music already en
sconced at the top of the 
charts. Just wait.
If all this Seventies stuff is 
news to you, youd better 
start listening to better radio, or 
start buying better records. (A 
good first step would be to take 
your copy of that swell new Pink 
Floyd album, on compact disc, no 
doubt, and go use it for something 
useful, like beating cats.) As afore 
mentioned, Soundgarden and 
Mudhoney have new albums, as 
do St. Vitus, the gods of slow, and 
Girl Trouble, the gods of goof, and 
its all better than anything U2 
has done in years. Besides, they 
need the money more than Bono 
needs another pair of boots made 
from dead reptiles, so do some
thing useful with your cash.

Drive-in taxation without representation.
Joe Bobs ten-point tax-proofing plan
A lot of you have been coming 
. by the trailer house, asking me to 
fill.outyour 1040 tax forms, or the 
^abbreviated tax form 1040-T, 
which stands for Take it all. 
Qbviously, there are some misun
derstandings about the new im
proved Reagan tax laws, so heres
- the ten questions I been person: ally asked about most often.
, 1. Can I deduct mileage to and
- from the liquor store if I go there
   
,P" for-a business purpose?
; A. Yes, you can. An acceptable 
!; business purpose would be I was 
!! thinking about buying me a liq' uor store one day maybe when I 
i- get some money.
2. Does the home mortgage 
 deduction apply to my situation?
; A. Yes. Many of you are wonL, dering why you bought a house 
r .ten years ago for $80,000 and now 
; you owe $150,000 on it. And the 
;! reason is simple. The home mort1 gage deduction! You get to keep 
j paying on it like FOREVER. And
its all DEDUCTIBLE. See, if it 
wasnt deductible, then youd 
, probly by paying it down to next 
| to nothing, and then you wouldnt 
;| have anything to deduct.
3. How much tax do rich people
: pay?
; A. The new tax laws treat the 
; wealthy about the same as they 
; were treated in the past. They 
 pay nothing.
4. How can I reduce my taxes? 
A. Make more money! The more
;; you make, the less you pay.
5. What if Ive got a big wad of 
1 receipts in my dresser but I cant
remember what any of em were
for and also some of em are faded 
and so I cant read the amounts or 
the dates on em?
A. Youre in luck. Write care
fully, in ink, on each receipt, the 
following words: Airport park
ing, client pickup, plus $7.00 in 
tips. Another one that always 
works is Misc. office supplies. 
Remember, the more boring you 
can make it, the better. Try some
thing imaginative like Two-ply 
industrial pipe 
linkage. These 
IRS guys are just 
like you and me. 
Who wants to have 
a conversation 
about THAT?
6. What about 
the $4,700.84 in in
terest I paid last 
year to MasterCard, VISA, Dis
cover Card, and Bobs Discount 
Credit?
A. Ronnie nailed you on this 
one. All this time we thought we 
were being good citizens, running 
up all that credit. It turns out, we 
get NO tax benefits for wasting 
all that money. My recommenda
tion: If you owe, say $27,000 to 
VISA, increase that monthly 
payment form $15 to about twenty 
bucks so you can get it paid off 
quicker.
7. What if I cheated on my 
expense account at the office?
A. Still allowed. No reason to 
report it on your return.
8. May I claim alimony as an 
above-the-line deduction?
A. Yes, but I find the taxpayer 
is better able to deal with this 
particular deduction if he first 
scrawls The little golddigger 
drained me dry! across the top of 
the form 1040. This in no way 
invalidates your return, but it does 
amuse the IRS agents, making 
them more sympathetic to your 
eventual audit.
9. What is the chance Ill be 
audited?

Quasicrystals?

These are just a few of the exciting new 
discoveries in Materials Science today!

Speaking of enormous devour

The Fly II is finally out, and its 
one of the best insect sequels since 
Aliens. Eric Stoltz, the half
human, half-insect son of oozing 
pizza-face Jeff Goldblum from the 
first movie, is growing up nor
mally in this gigantic day-care
center chemistry lab where they 
torture innocent dogs for scien
tific purposes. Only one little 
problem. They forgot to tell Eric 
that he will eventually look like a 
Tyrannosaurus Rex with anorexia 
thats been turned inside out and 
dropped into a vat of strawberry 
Jello. When Eric finds out, though, 
boy is he STEAMED. Since he 
grows about four times faster than 
normal, he was already the most 
sexually experienced 5-year-old 
in town, and now THIS had to 
happen. How can he break it to 
Daphne Zuniga? Will Daphne still 
want to kiss him? How many globs 
of intestinal goo will it take to 
finish this movie? The Fly was 
icky, but bingo! The Fly II is 
ICKIER. No breasts. Seven dead

This week is hell, isnt it? Youve 
got five midterms, youre study
ing your brains out, and youre 
still failing. The last thing you 
want to do after a week like this is 
use your brain. Well, I have some 
good news for you. This weeks 
lineup of movies does not require 
the use of a single brain cell to 
watch and enjoy. Sit back and 
unwind with this weeks flicks.
The first film is an old favorite 
of mine, Death Race 2000. In the 
year 2000 the USAs economy has 
collapsed and the nation has gone 
into complete turmoil. As a way to 
take everyones mind off the dying 
country, once a year Americas 
most loved sporting event is held, 
the transcontinental road race.
The chief ingredients needed to 
win this race are speed and points 
amassed by running over pedes
trians. The scores range from 
women, worth ten points, to tod
dlers and the elderly, worth sev
enty points and a whopping one 
hundred points respectively. If 
you think that the rules to this
race are odd, just wait until 
you see the teams.
The five bizarre partici
pants in this race are Nero 
the Hero, Calamity Jane, 
Matilda the Hun, Machine 
Gun Joe Viterbo (loved by 
thousands, hated by mil
lions and played by 
Sylvester Stallone), and 
everyones favorite, the man 
who has survived more 
races than anyone else, the 
man who lost his jaw in 92, his 
right eye in 95, his nose and left 
eye in 97, his left arm and most of 
his cranium in 98, and his right 
and left leg in 99, the one and 
only Frankenstein (David Carradine)!
The team cars portray screw
ball characters as well as the 
drivers do. Calamity Janes car 
has sharp pointy bull horns on 
the front, and Machine Gun Joe 
Viterbos car has guns and a huge 
razor sharp knife blade protrud
ing from the front. Frankensteins 
car is by far the strangest  its 
something of a cross between 
Dracula and a stegosaurus.
Not everyone enjoys the race,
- \ mm
though. A band of rebels (led by a 
woman calling herself Thomasina Paine) set out to sabotage the 
proceedings by blowing up a few 
of the contestants cars. One of 
the great moments in this film is 
when the government is unable 
to admit that there are, in fact, 
any rebels in their midst. In turn, 
the authorities take the only 
honorable course  they blame it 
on the French.
This movie is a lot of fun and 
covers just about every taste  
sex, humor, violence, social sat
ire, and slapstick. You even get to 
see Sly Stallone, Mr. Rocky Balboa 
himself, get his ass kicked by the 
pencil thin Frankenstein. The
acting is OK, but Sly defi
nitely steals the show as 
the hilariously irritable 
Machine Gun Joe Viterbo. 
Check this movie out.
Next up to bat is bloodsoaked shock-a-rama hor
ror movie, The Evil Dead. 
This movie is not for the 
light at heart as it is not 
rated and the producers 
wmf recommend that no one 
under 17 be allowed to see
it.
The plot: People come to a cot
tage in the Michigan woods, dis
cover a rare copy of the Book of the 
Dead, and accidentally invoke evil 
spirits. The spirits possess one of 
the women in the party by raping 
her with a tree. (I told you that 
this movie was heavy.) The spir
its run amok, killing people left 
and right and then taking over 
their dead bodies. The hero (Bruce 
Campbell) hopelessly battles 
these spirits, who are everywhere
 in the basement, in the woods, 
and behind every doorbut he is 
no real match for them. By the 
end, everyone is dead and youre 
not quite sure what happens to
the hero (as with all good horror 
flicks), but I am told if you watch 
Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn you 
are told what happens to him.
The first half hour of this movie 
is quite boring. Nothing impor
tant happens except that they find 
the book and invoke the spirits. 
After the rape scene, though, the 
movie really picks up. Heads split, 
guts spill, slime spews, and blood 
sprays all over everything. If 
nauseating images of horrific gore 
are not your cup of tea, then you 
might not enjoy this movie.
The special effects are grubby 
and low-budget, but they give the 
film a lovable quality that some 
high-tech movies wouldnt have. 
Once the gore starts, it never lets 
up and never disappoints you. 
There is a great scene at the end
of the movie where all the dead 
bodies are exploding guts' and 
blood and it all seems to land on 
the hero. He takes a blood bath, 
literally.
Eventually the violence and 
gore are carried to such an ex
treme that they stop being dis
gusting and become surrealistic. 
The camera work is wonderfully 
done and will surprise you with 
its quality. If you want tojust 
relax and kill some brain cells off 
or just love really good horror 
films, then I suggest you see this 
movie.
New in the video stores in the 
next two weeks are Poltergeist 
III, Imagine: John Lennon, U2: 
Rattle and Hum, A Fish Called 
Wanda, Midnight Run, Married 
to the Mob, and Big Business.

Its so exciting to be 52 years 
old and still be learning some
thing new every day. Theres so 
much that I dont know, and so 
much that I can still do. I find that 
very exciting.
Billy Wilson, who is currently 
directing the Drama Depart
ments production ofALittleNight 
Music, is clearly enjoying his 
work. It is important to stay in 
touch with that better part of 
yourself, to celebrate yourself, and 
to try to be positive about every
thing you do  its so easy to let 
negative people get you down, 
says Wilson, who has been active 
in professional theatre for over 
thirty years.
He started as a dancer in the 
Philadelphia public schools at the 
age of seven and began studying 
ballet when he was 15. By the 
time he was 19, Wilson was danc
ing on Broadway, where he ap
peared in Bells Are Ringing and 
Jamaica. He then went from 
Broadway to the West End with 
the original London production of 
West Side Story. He was later 
engaged as a soloist with the 
National Ballet of Holland and 
spent ten years working in Eu
rope. Returning to America hasnt 
slowed him down, either. He has 
added to his experiences by teach
ing at various theatre schools, 
including Carnegie Mellon.
Although Wilson did dance on 
Broadway in musical theatre, his 
true devotion was to classical 
dancing. Dancing in Broadway 
shows is the life of a gypsy. You do 
have to be dedicated, but not to 
the extent that you have to be in 
a dance company. Most serious 
dancers want to dance in a seri
ous company. Wilson has danced 
and choreographed extensively in 
both areas. Of dance, he says, 
Its all the same thing. Only the 
material is different. Its the same 
kind of preparation  getting to 
know the music, and understand
ing what the piece is about. 
Wilson feels much the same way 
about directing. He says, I dont 
really approach a show at CMU 
very differently from one Im doing 
on Broadway. The main differ
ence is that this is a learning 
experience. Im trying to create a 
working atmosphere and a per
forming atmosphere where the 
students are reaching and grow
ing and developing.
Wilson originally started teach
ing, he says, ...[Because] as a 
young dancer, it was a way to 
make extra money. I was required 
to teach at my local school as part 
of a scholarship I had, but I also 
found that I enjoyed it. Wilson 
believes that a person shouldnt 
start teaching just because they
arent dancing. Theres a differ
ence between someone who gives 
a class and someone who teaches 
a class, and not every good dancer 
is a good teacher.
Although Wilson has taught at 
several other theatre schools, 
including Boston University and 
Harvard, he says that CMU has 
one of the best programs. It re
ally has an eye on preparing 
people for the professions, which 
is something I stress. This is an 
opportunity to learn more about 
what you will be doing in your 
lifes work. In all honesty, CMU is 
the only academic theatre situ
ation Ive been in where I feel 
happy to come back.
Wilson, who has worked in the 
theatre for, as he puts it, a very 
long time, has seen many changes 
in entertainment since his early 
years: I sadly see the rise and the 
flourish of mediocrity, particu
larly in the field of popular enter
tainment. Its hard to find things 
of quality, movies or television 
shows that are thought-provok
ing, because you have to pick over 
all the trash thats out there.
Also, I find the trend nowa
days is to want everything imme
diately. You cannot arrive at being 
a fine artist or a fine anything 
overnight. It takes time, develop
ment, and education  particu
larly the kind that opens your

r! Amidst the excitement of the 
impending Academy Awards, 
^Holl^wood studios are planning a 
[number of spring releases which 
will feature the transitional works 
gof famous TV actors Corbin Bern*]sen ofL.A. Law and Fred Gwynne 
|better known as Herman MunsteE), the long-awaited New York 
Sto\'i-es, and a number of comelies.
Fred Gwynne, famous for his 
portrayal of Herman Munster, 
vvill appear in two upcoming films: 
^Paramount Pictures Pet 
SSemaiary andTouchstonesBa/i/e 
%Job. Pet Sematary, one of a few 
Stephen King novels that has not 
jvet been adapted to film, will be 
the first to have a screenplay 
^written by King himself. Fred 
jwynne will star as Jud Cran
dall, a resident of Ludlow, Maine, 
a small town where a young family 
discovers the terrifying secret of a 
graveyard for deceased pets.
Bank Job is yet another com
edy/action film centered around a 
group ofbuddies and a failed bank 
robbery. In addition to the talents 
of Fred Gwynne, the diverse cast 
will also include Hoyt Axton and 
Corbin Bernsen (what a busy 
fellow.)Bank Job was written and 
directed by Jim Kouf, who also 
wrote the 1987 Touchstone film, 
Stakeout.
Touchstone Pictures New York 
Stories is the long-awaited an
thology of three short films set in 
New York by directors Woody 
Allen, Francis Ford Coppola, and 
Martin Scorcese. The casting of 
the films of Coppola and Allen are 
obviously biased and tend towards 
nepotism with Allens segment 
starringhimself and his long-time
companion and mother of his 
child, Mia Farrow, and Coppolas 
segment which will star his 
daughter, Sofia Coppola. Nick 
Nolte and Rosanna Arquette will 
star in Scorceses film.
The comedies slated for release 
in the spring include Paramount 
Pictures Let It Ride and Major 
League as well as Touchstone 
Pictures animated re-release of 
the 1977 film, The Rescuers.
Let It Ride is a racetrack com
edy starring Richard Dreyfuss, 
David Johansen, and Teri Garr. 
The film follows the adventures 
of a number of off-beat racetrack 
regulars and their attempts to 
beat the odds and win their 
fortunes.
Major League also deals with 
underdog perseverance as it fol
lows the attempts of the hapless 
Cleveland Indians who have not 
won a pennant for thirty-five
years. The film is based on writer 
and director David Wards life
time and long-suffering obses
sion with the tribe. The film 
stars Corbin Bernsen, Tom Berenger, and Charlie Sheen.
Finally, The Rescuers is one of 
the most successful animated 
releases in the history of Walt 
Disney Studio. The voices of Bob 
Newhart and Eva Gabor enhance 
this touching story of two mice 
determined to rescue a young 
orphaned girl. Touchstones rerelease of this picture is slated for 
March 17.
In addition to its spring releases, 
Paramount Pictures also has a 
few interesting pictures in pro
duction that are going to be re
leased in the spring or summer 
including Star Trek V: The Final 
Frontier and Black Rain, an inter
national thriller starring Michael 
Douglas and Kate Capshaw.

JSpecial to The Tartan i i
} Tonight, the Forbes Gallery 
hosts the opening of a show of 
works on paper by Mickey Dry burgh and Amy McCoy. Both
 artists work primarily in the 
media of lithography and 
jmonoprint, and they experiment 
(beyond these media by working 
back into their prints with inks 
painted on by hand.
! Mickey and Amy find that using the figure as subject matter 
gallows them to express thoughts 
^about human emotion. Amy, in 
.particular, has worked with the 
figure for several years. Her early
work, however, was much 
more literal in its repre
sentation of the human 
form. Just recently, Amy 
has begun to develop a 
looser method of working.
Her latest prints still re
fer to figures and human 
relationships, but with 
much more simplified form 
and hence, an ambiguity that 
allows for other associations. Amy 
has also opened up the space in 
recent prints by using brighter 
color, whereas her earlier work 
used darker values that covered 
more of the paper.
Mickeys prints, similarly, are 
more simplified than her earlier
rorbes
Callery
figurative work. The figures in 
her latest prints are often an
drogynous and ambiguous  
many are bald or show minimal 
features as cues that they are 
indeed faces. One print titled, 
What Do You See When You 
Close Your Eyes? shows a pleth
ora of ambiguous body parts.
meshed into an imaginary 
landscape. In the center is 
a large face whose fore
head turns into another 
figures torso. This color
ful print was done after a 
similar black and white 
one; she will probably show 
them together.
Another black and white 
print of Mickeys was the result of 
an assignment to make a print 
that was 80% black. Loose, gestu
ral, and Franz Kline-like best de
scribes this piece; of its web-like 
quality, Mickey says that to her, 
it represents all the shit built up 
in your head you have to sift 
through.
Stop by and check it out, and 
meet the artists tonight from 7-9 
pm at their opening reception. 
The Forbes Gallery is on the cor
ner of Margaret Morrison St. and 
Forbes Ave., just past the con
struction site. Weekly hours are 
Wednesday through Saturday, 11- 
7, and Sunday, 12-5.
Mickey and Amy have organ
ized another arts event through 
an internship, this one in coop
eration with the Carnegie Mellon 
Art Department, and sponsored 
by the Womens Center of 
Oakland. A Celebration of 
Women In Art, a juried show of 
six local women artists, willbe 
held in May at the Frick Gallery.
While their hubbys are out oftowi 
on a golf holiday, the humble 
housewives are eagerly awaiting 
the arrival of Maurice, a dashing 
Frenchman and former lover1<j 
both women. (In case you haven't; 
guessed, Julia and Jane are noj 
your typical prim and propel 
young British ladies.)
The long wait ahead of them! 
will result in Coward at his finest; 
giddy drunk scenes, catty clev 
erness, and witty non sequiturj 
abound while the girls anticipate 
the rekindling of a fiery passion; 
long since extinguished by theic 
wedding vows.
The show stars Robin Moselv! 
as Julia Sterroll and Margery 
Murray as Jane Banbury. Simoii 
Juturas, a veteran of stage ani 
television screen, is the French; 
man, Maurice Duclos.
The unfortunate husbands ar 
Samuel Maupin as Fred Banbury 
and Cuzon Dobell as Willy Ster-I 
roll. The director is Philip Minor, 
who has directed throughout the 
United States for twenty-fwo 
years.
The show will begin preview 
starting tonight, February 21 
Opening night is March 1, an( 
the show will run through Marcl 
26.

DH2210 THIS WEEK
Thursday, February 23 The Magic Flute
Directed by Ingmar Bergman, this film adaptation 
:of Mozarts opera of the same name is exquisite. 
Bergman films the action that unfolds in a staging of 
one of Mozarts greatest works. Bergmans excep
tional film will be especially moving to music lovers. 
Subtitled.

Friday, February 24 Tucker: The Man and His Dream
This film can be seen as . a parable for director 
Francis Ford Coppolas life: Tuckers failed attempt to 
beat the big three auto companies with his own car is 
similar to Coppolas blighted attempts at establishing 
his own studio. The scenery, and Joe Jacksons musi
cal score, are the chief assets of this movie. The story 
line tends to drag and is very predictable, as is Jeff 
Bridges characterization of Preston Tucker. Still, the 
film (in theatrical release) did very well with the 
critics.

Saturday, February 25 A Soldiers Story
Starring Howard Rollins, Jr., Adolph Caesar (in his 
last major role), and Denzel Washington, based on the 
Pulitzer Prize-winning play by Charles Fuller, and 
directed by Norman Jewison, this film is an insightful 
look into race relations in World War II America. The 
story recounts the mysterious murder of a black 
soldier in a Louisiana town in 1944. A Soldiers Story 
is one of the few films to transcend both black and 
white stereotypes and to present the ravaging effects 
of racism from a black perspective. The film is pre
sented by SDC as one of the events marking February 
as Black History Month.
At 6, 8, 10, 12
Sunday, February 26 On the Waterfront
This is one of the great classics of American cinema. 
Marlon Brando, Eva Marie Saint, Rod Steiger and 
Karl Malden star in this riveting portrayal of corrup
tion and crime on the docks of New Jersey. The film 
swept the Academy Awards in 1954, winning awards 
for best film, best actor (Marlon Brando), and best 
supporting actress (Eva Marie Saint). Directed by 
Elia Kazan, On the Waterfront is definitely worth 
seeing.

Tind... I would especially like to 
ie more passion in the perform[rs. There just isnt that passion 
at I remember as a young perin. Theyd have to throw us out 
|f dancing school in those days. 
Wilson believes that one of the 
ost important aspects of any 
ireer is to have choices. He has 
ever missed out, despite being a 
lack performer. I did not feel 
ery limited in what I could do in 
iy career, and I didnt feel it at all 
'hen I was in Europe. I was lucky, 
ecause of my gift, people in 
lUrope wanted me to dance for 
'em, so I was able to dance all 
ie big roles. I think they were 
terested in me particularly 
ecause I was a black American. 
1 know that if I had stayed in 
Us country, I would have had a 
!ry different kind of career. I 
ouldnthave had the opportuni6s I had in Europe. There are so 
any talented people of color who 
) not have those opportunities. 
Will this situation get better?
Wilson doesnt think so. There 
was a time when I would have 
said yes, I think so, but not any
more. The only thing that would 
make it better would be somethingl dont know anythingabout.
People perceive persons of color 
in a certain way or in a certain 
role, and it makes them uncom
fortable to see somethingthatgoes 
against that. Some people cant 
imagine an oriental person in a 
play unless the play is about ori
entals. I always tell my students 
not to worry about making other 
people comfortable, just worry 
about making yourself happy.
Wilson has done this, and had 
a satisfying career as a result. 
One of the reasons for this is his 
connection with his spiritual self. 
The only way youre goingto learn 
is to fail. I may not be perfect, but 
theres only one me in the whole 
universe, and that means some
thing. Its best not to dwell on the 
negative things in life  think 
positively. No one can wake up 
every morning and fail.
Read Joe Bob Goes to 
the Drive-In or well 
tell your creditors 
where you live.

Thursday, March 2 Rivers Edge
Dennis Hopper is absolutely chilling and his relation
ship with his inflatable doll, Ellie, is one of the high
lights of this story of apathy and immorality among a 
group of high school students. After one high school 
student kills his girlfriend and then shows off her corpse 
to his friends, the group grapples with the dilemma of 
whether to keep his secret or betray him by revealing 
his appalling crime. Its not The Breakfast Club but it is 
definitely worth seeing for its unabashed realism and 
suspense.
At 6, 8,10
Friday, March 3 Alien Nation
Alien Nation, a science-fiction/detective film, was 
released this past fall and stars Mandy Patinkin and 
James Caan. The script, although tightly written, doesnt 
ring true in a number of instances and does not ade
quately present the developing relationship between 
alien Patinkin and earthling James Caan. Special ef
fects and makeup are both well done, and Patinkin 
gives a very strong performance as the alien policeman.
At 6, 8,10,12
Saturday, March 4 Betrayed
Debra Winger and Tom Berenger star in this disturb
ing story of white supremacy and the murder of a 
Jewish talk show host in Americas heartland. Win
gers F.B.I. agent character is somewhat unrealistic, 
but her acting transcends the problems of the script. 
The film succeeds in showing that evil is pervasive in 
all authoritative institutions, in both the practices of 
the white supremists and the F.B.I.
At 6, 8:30,11
Sunday, March 5 The Manchurian Candidate
This controversial 1962 film was just re-released 
last year. It stars Frank Sinatra, Janet Leigh and 
Angela Lansbury in a tale of a soldier who is brain
washed by Communists and becomes a pawn in an 
evil plot to undermine and eventually destroy the 
freedom-loving democracy of America. The Manchu
rian Candidate is a unique work that defies classifi
cation and succeeds as a thriller, a satire, and a 
suspenseful drama.

THE NOID* 
CRUSHED BY 
THE NEWS
(DP) The NOID panicked, 
(bonking himself on the head with 
a pan!) when he heard that 
Dominos now delivers pan pizza.
New Dominos Pan Pizza has 
thick, chewy crust, generous top
pings, and lots of thick, gooey 
cheese. And its delivered in 30 
minutes or less, guaranteed. All of 
which creates pandemonium for 
the NOID.
So call for new Dominos Pan 
Pizza. When it comes to pan pizza,
