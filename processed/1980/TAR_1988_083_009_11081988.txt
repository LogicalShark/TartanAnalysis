Campus computers infected by new virus
By CARLOS FRANCO
Tartan News Editor
Last week a computer virus 
spread throughout the country 
and Carnegie Mellon over the 
Arpanet (Advanced Research 
Projects Agency) network.
Arpanet is a communications 
network run by the military. It 
was established to allow research
ers to share information electroni
cally. The network connects com
puters belonging to universities,,
defense contractors, and the 
Department of Defense together.
In addition to being spread over 
Arpanet, the virus also spread 
over Milnet, a high security mili
tary research network.
The virus spread through these 
two networks to computers 
throughout the nation, causing 
them to slow down in their nor
mal operations.
The virus, or worm, as Carne
gie Mellon System Designer Craig 
Everhart callsit, spreads through
two well publicized services of the 
Berkeley Unix system: finger and 
mail.
According to Everhart, the 
worm enters the system through 
a couple of holes which are pres
ent in Berkeley Unix. Once the 
worm enters the system it copies 
itself and keeps doing so until it 
paralyzes the system, clarified 
Everhart.
This particular worm is thought 
not to erase data, but simply to 
reproduce itself.
CMU prepares for NextStep
By RUSS SELIGMAN
Tartan Business Manager
When the NeXT Computer 
System was unveiled last month, 
many people were shocked by
NeXT president Steve -----------
Jobs announcement 
that the revolutionary 
machine would be avail
able only to people and 
organizations involved 
in higher education.
Based on Jobs history,
as well as the history of -----------
his creation, a NeXT 
machine could not be more at 
home than at Carnegie Mellon.
Carnegie Mellon is one of the 
original investors in NeXT and, 
with such distinguished company 
as Stanford University and bil
lionaire entrepreneur H. Ross 
Perot, has one-half of one percent 
ownership of the company.
But Carnegie, Mellons contri
bution to what some people call 
the next generation of computers 
does not end with financial in
vestments.
Vice President for Academic 
Services William Arms has been 
in the NeXT advisory group almost since day one.
I remember sitting down with 
them in 1985 ... to talk about 
what what we thought comput
ing was going to be like in the 
universities, Arms recalled. Of
Cyert is very explicit about 
... not [requiring] people to 
purchase computers.

course, we came up with an 
enormous wish list.
The initial brainstorming ses
sions were folio wed by about three 
months of market research, as 
Jobs travelled around the coun
try and visited various universi
ties  including, of course, Car
negie Mellon.
Jobs has a great psychological 
and personal affection for univer
sities, Arms said. The leading 
universities have been his sup
porters for many years.

full- time students.
Funding and Recognition 
Committee Chairman Chuck 
Jainchill opened the discussion 
with a brief explanation of the 
funding procedure. He then 
invited the students present to 
ask questions.
In answer to a question about 
what Senate looks for in decid

organization, Jainchill said that 
organizations are classified as 
either non-funded (organiza
tions who receive no money but 
are recognized by Senate), 
funded, or service (such as

bulletin board, System Designer

Everhart stated that the only 
real problem that the worm 
caused was to infect one of the 
four Andrew mailer machines.
He went on to say it became so 
backed up with the worm that it 
took a huge amount of time to
process the jobs.
According to Everhart, systems 
run by the Computer Science 
department and the Electrical and 
Computer Engineering Depart

worm. He could not give an esti

According to Arms, Jobs said 
that some of the most interesting 
educational computingprojects at 
any college were on this campus.

members, including 
Raj Reddys work with

The operating system Mach, 
which is the foundation of the 
NeXT software, was also devel

a variation of the popular com

Spring Carnival to 
be held in Skibo lot
By LORI MARRACINO
Tartan Staffwriter
Planning for Spring Carnival 
1989 has been underway for about 
two months, and those involved 
have had some serious problems 
to deal with.
The major problem these plan
ners had to face was to find a new 
location for Carnival. Since the 
construction taking place on 
campus has destroyed the park
ing lot where Midway is tradi
tionally held, there was a need to 
find another place that could suc
cessfully accommodate the booths, 
rides, and people.
The Margaret Morrison and 
Morewood Gardens parking lots 
were two locations considered by 
Carnival officials, but the most 
recent decision was to remain in 
Skibo lot with booths and rides 
sharing the space that had for
merly been used by rides and the 
SDC tent.
According to Spring Carnival 
Chairman David Levy, the Mar
garet Morrison lot would have 
been an ideal location, but con
struction planned for next year 
would have meant moving the 
Carnival site again. At the Skibo 
location, were safe for a few years 
at least, Levy commented.
A new location will again be 
needed when construction begins 
on the new University Center, 
now scheduled to begin after the 
graduation of the Class of 1990.
The present layout for Carnival 
will line the booths in a W-shaped 
pattern on the section of the Skibo 
lot previously occupied by the SDC 
tent and the smaller rides. The 
rides and the Alpha Phi Omega 
concessions would be moved to 
the other half of the lot, and the

University raises $119M
By BRYAN E. WONG
Tartan Staffwriter
The Capital Campaign, started in 1986 
with a goal of $200 million, so far has gifts 
and pledges in excess of $119 million. In 
addition, there is the Annual Fund which 
includes gifts from alumni, Trustees, fac
ulty, staff, parents, friends, and corpora
tions. This past fund year was the most 
successful in the history of the University, 
with an amount of $34,477,692.
Explaining the differences between the 
Capital Campaign and the Annual Fund, 
Vice President for Development Alvin P. 
Brannick stated, The Annual Fund be
gan in the 1960s because universities like 
Carnegie Mellon believed that tuition alone 
was not enough to pay for the expansion of 
higher education. These Annual Funds 
were called Capital Campaigns and gener
ally lasted for ten years. The last campaign 
ended in 1980, one year short of the pro
jected timetable. It was cut off early be
cause of the declining contributions. These 
campaigns are used to fund buildings, 
scholarships^en.dowments, and professor
ships for the entire University. According 
to Brannick, The private side of society 
should pay for ... the bricks and mortar.
Last year this school was one of the top 20 
universities in corporate fundraising. 
According to Brannick, the amount of 
money is increasing each year. He also 
said the fundraising group will go on even 
afterthe completion ofthecampaign.There 
is always a necessity of priorities and budg
ets for the different projects. If we build 
things like the Taj Mahal, we could be 
broke.

Coup attempt put 
down in Maldives
COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP)  
About 150 foreign gunmen tried 
to overthrow the government of 
Maldives Thursday, seizing sev
eral top government officials. The 
president requested U.S. and 
Indian assistance.
There was no immediate word 
on the number of casualties.
The attackers arrived in Male, 
capital of the archipelago nation, 
by boat before dawn and attacked 
the presidential palace.
The Maldives, a tropical island 
chain that is home to 190,000 
people, is 400 miles southwest of 
Sri Lanka and India.
A senior Maldivian diplomat in 
Colombo said government troops 
repulsed the attackers, but Male 
residents contacted by telephone 
said bursts of gunfire were con
tinuing at 10-minute intervals 
more than 12hours aftertheraid.
An Indian Foreign Ministry 
spokesman in New Delhi said 
President Maumoon Abdul 
Gayoom was safe and had per
sonally asked India to send mili
tary assistance. The spokesman 
said the Indian government was 
considering the request.
He said reports from the Indian 
High Commission, or embassy, in 
Male indicated the attackers were 
Sri Lankan and spoke Tamil and 
Sinhalese.
Both languages are spoken in 
Sri Lanka.

Indicators show 
economy slowed 
in September
WASHINGTON (DJ)  The 
index of leadingindicators dipped 
into negative territory in Septem
ber, a further sign that growth in 
the U.S. economy is slowing.
Recent statistics implying 
weaker economic growth include 
slowing export demand, slacken
ing expansion in jobs creation, 
and some evidence of reduced 
capital spending.
The Commerce Department 
said Tuesday that the leading 
index edged down 0.1 percent in 
September, a weaker performance 
than the 0.1 percent gain a con
sensus of economists polled by 
Dow Jones Capital Markets Re
port had been expecting.
The September decline was the 
second decrease in three months, 
following a 0.5 percent August 
increase and a 0.7 percent drop in 
July.
David Wyss, chief financial 
economist at Data Resources Inc. 
in Lexington, Mass., points out 
that an economic slowdown at 
this stage is probably healthy, 
since U.S. industry has been 
working at nearly full capacity 
for some time and inflation is 
beginning to heat up.
Producer critical 
to NASA, Air 
Force closes
WASHINGTON (DJ)  The 
closing Thursday of a Virginia 
rayon company threatens to slow 
the rate of space-shuttle launches 
and the production of Air Force 
missiles.
Avtex Fibers Front Royal Inc., 
a closely held Front Royal, Va., 
fiber manufacturer, is the nations 
only producer of carbonized rayon 
yam used to insulate solid-rocket 
nozzles. NASA said it has enough 
of the material on hand for about 
a dozen space-shuttle launches. 
The Air Force said it uses the
material in the MX and Midgetman missiles, and in a host of 
tactical missiles, but it wasnt sure 
how much it has on hand.
The potential effects of the 
closing are very serious, said 
Royce Mitchell, a NASA solidrocket motor manager. Wellhave 
to develop an alternative source 
or get this guy back on his feet 
again.
John Gregg, Avtexs chairman 
and chief executive officer, said in 
a statement that the company 
was closing because it couldnt 
compete with lower-cost foreign 
products. But Avtex, which em
ployed 1,300 people, alsohasbeen 
beset by a host of environmental 
and workpl ace-safe ty complaints.
Mitchell said it would be diffi
cult and expensive for another 
company to win Air Force and 
NASA approval to produce car
bonized rayon. The company 
would have to duplicate Avtexs 
process and pass through a series 
of stringent tests, including testrocket firings, before the govern
ment would approve the new 
supplier.

NEW YORK (DJ)  Imelda

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  8 November 1988-3
NeXT, IBM machines to work with Andrew system
continued from page 1
campus-wide Andrew network 
being developed jointly by Carne
gie Mellon and IBM.
In many ways its the machine 
we were dreaming of when we 
started the Andrew project, Arms 
said, with one small but impor
tant exception  it costs twice 
what we dreamed.
When the Andrew network was 
first conceived, it was expected 
that by 1988 compatible worksta
tions would cost approximately 
$3000, and that each student 
would be able to purchase one.
At present, NeXTplansto sell a 
base machine to institutions of 
higher education for $6770. Cur
rently supported Andrew work
stations, such as the IBM RT and 
Sun 3, sell for a similar amount.
Although the NeXT system is 
considered by some to be the 
perfect Andrew workstation, 
there are no plans to make it the 
only supported workstation.
In fact, an agreement between 
NeXT and IBM makes it likely 
that IBMs new PS/2 machines 
will be seen in Andrew clusters.
NeXT has licensed its user in
terface, called NextStep, to IBM
for development on its PS/2s and 
RTs. User interface is a general 
term describing the tools provided 
which allow the user to interact 
with the computer.
This includes how information 
is presented on the screen, as well 
as how the user inputs informa
tion, such as with a mouse or key
board.
Even though NeXT is based on 
Mach and the PS/2 is based on 
IBMs own version of Unix called 
AIX, the identical user interface 
will be provided on each. This will 
prevent a user from having to 
learn to use both machines.
Arms sees the agreement be
tween NeXT and IBM as really 
lucky for the University. He 
added, The marvelous thing 
thats happened to us is we have 
this very creative team [NeXT]... 
and we have the strength of the 
IBM corporation.... We can work 
with both IBM and NeXT as a 
single project, rather than as bit
ter rivals...
In addition to preparing the 
NeXT and IBM machines for use 
with Andrew, a project called 
MacMach is currently in the final 
stages of development by a team
at Carnegie Mellon. MacMach is 
an application which will allow a 
Macintosh II to run the Mach 
operatingsystem, and therefore 
connect to the Andrew system.
However, since NeXT has not 
licensed the NextStep user inter
face to Apple Computer, a differ
ent interface will be implemented 
on the Macintosh II, although 
functionality will remain the same 
across machines. The question of 
whether there should be a stan
dard user interface for all An
drew machines is one which has 
not yet been decided.
This is an area of considerable 
uncertainty, said Arms. Do we 
go for the best of what we can run 
on each piece of equipment, which 
means [the interface] will be dif
ferent on different types, or do we 
go for a uniformity ... across the 
machines, but well lose the best 
features of some?
Arms said that he and other

A student works on an IBM RT Andrew workstation in the Wean cluster.
people from within the Univer
sity havebeen meeting with Presi
dent Cyert to try to understand 
what we should be doing with the 
user interface world.
Although the current price of a 
powerful Andrew-compatible 
machine is beyond the reach of 
most students, Arms believes that 
smaller, cheaper computers, such 
as the Macintosh Plus and SE, 
are integral parts of what he calls 
Andrew Plus. This refers to the 
idea that the Andrew network is 
not limited to the powerful ma
chines in public clusters.
A user with a Macintosh SE in 
his room could use the available 
Macintosh software as well as 
various Andrew network services 
such as reading electronic mail, 
printing documents to public 
printers, viewing the library cata
log  and would use a worksta
tion such as NeXT only when 
powerful processing was neces
sary, such as for a class.
Cyert is very explicit about ... 
not [requiring] people to purchase 
computers, Arms assured. The 
University, however, will offer 
programs nextfall tomake it easy 
for students to rent and, if de
sired, purchase their own com
puters.
Although NeXT is currently 
selling only to higher education, 
IBM plans to market their 
NextStep machines to anyone who 
wants one. IBMs backing should 
encourage third party developers 
to create software for the NextStep 
interface, which will then 'be 
available for NeXT, as well. ,
Arms predicts that NeXT will 
begin to sell to selectednon-higher 
education customers soon, possi
bly within a year. Organizations 
related to the academic commu
nity, such as libraries, science 
research laboratories, and non
profit laboratories, are the most 
likely candidates, Arms said. ,
WhenNeXT was announced last 
month, it was revealed that two 
groupson campus had pre-release 
machines. Arms expects another 
shipment of pre-release machines 
this month, to be used for testing 
various software projects.
Arms expects that the MacMach 
project will be completed by fall
1989, and hopes that the NeXT 
and IBM machines, using the 
NextStep user interface, will-be 
installed in clusters soon after.
Schwartz speaks on weapons contracts
By JAMES B. ENDRES
Tartan Staffwriter
Professor Charles Schwartz, a 
professor of physics at the Uni
versity of California at Berkeley, 
delivered an address at CMU on 
Monday, October 31. Entitled 
The Future of Science and the 
Military, Schwartzs talk was 
attended by about sixty under
graduate and graduate students 
and faculty members.
Schwartz began by explaining 
that he makes no distinction be
tween pure and applied sci
ence. He said that __________
when it comes to 
looking at questions 
ofthe arms race...the 
two are so tightly, 
bound up that there 
is no room for distinction....
Schwartz argued 
that both hawks 
and doves have 
very similar stances 
on nuclear weapons, 
and that they work 
together within the 
current framework 
(i.e. the Pentagon, 
private industry, and universi
ties) to perpetuate the arms race.
Schwartz stated,whatworries 
me most is the thrust toward 
systems that are more effectively
cited the first strike capability of 
the Minuteman 3a, MX and Tri
dent II missiles, systemsfor long
term battle management, and 
Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI, 
Star Wars) systems that would 
be more effective offensively but 
that are billed as defensive.
Schwartz warned that sudden 
scientific breakthroughs which 
are unforeseen until someone 
comes upon them are destabil
izing, because the nation who 
thinks that their .'jnemy has made 
a breakthrough will feel left be
hind. Progress in science and
"What I think is unethical is to 
ignore or to avoid... the respon
sibility to make an informed 
choice whether or not to con
tribute ones knowledge in the 
development of more weap
onry. 
Professor Shwartz
technology is full of surprises! 
Schwartz said. And surprises are 
a most likely way to upset stabil
ity. Thisfundamental point seems 
to be regularly ignored by the 
designed for active war- fighting experts.
than for passive deterrence. He Next, Schwartz asked, If we
somehow manage to arrive at a 
more safe and sane future on this 
planet, what might that future 
look like? He went on to propose 
an arrangement under which the 
United States and the Soviet 
Union would cooperate com
pletely, rather than compete, in 
the pursuit of weapons research.
Schwartz admitted, I know this 
sounds very strange at first. How 
can enemies be expected to col
laborate? Schwartz then asserted 
that secrecy is counter to secu
rity; that secret weapons are only 
useful for surprise attacks, and
__________ that the drivingforce
behind the forward 
thrust of weapons de
velopment is uncer
tainty about the 
other sides capabili
ties. He maintained 
that open coopera
tion would eliminate 
these problems. 
Schwartz also remindedthe audience 
that the recent dra
matic changes intro
duced by Gorbachev 
offer a whole new set 
of possibilities. 
Also, Schwartz held that if both 
sides cooperated, the govern
ments would find they needed far 
fewer scientists and engineers en
gaged in weapons research and 
development, and so many more

Physical Plant digs trenches in the Mall
By CARLOS FRANCO
Tartan News Editor
Early last week, Physical 
plant installed natural gas 
lines and electrical lines for a 
new outdoor emergency gen
erator, which is to be installed 
in an underground shed be
tween Baker Hall and 
Doherty Hall.
It was necessary to dig 
trenches to the shed, which 
will house the automatic 
generator, from Doherty Hall 
in order to install natural gas 
lines. Physical Plant electri
cians also had to dig trenches 
from the shed to Baker Hall 
so they could install new elec
trical cable.
The new generator, which 
starts automatically when it 
detects an absence of power,
will replace the old manual gaso
line powered one. It will provide 
power to Carnegie Mellon Police 
Accordingto Maintenance Con
trol Supervisor Alan Harris, the
old generator was not reliable 
enough for our needs. Electrical 
Foreman George Jones that the 
problem with the old generator 
was It does not start automati______________

cally. We would lose power, and 
by the time a mechanic went 
and started the generator, we 
did nothave any telephone serv
ice or any two-way communica
tions.
Harris stated that the gas 
lines have all been installed, 
but they must still be covered 
with sand, which is scheduled 
to arrive this week, and then 
with concrete in order to pre
vent the lines from being punc
tured.
Jones said that some work 
that remains to be done before 
Physical Plant can place the new 
generator. He stated that the 
main emphasis has now been 
placed on fixing the grass. Jones 
expressed hope that the 
trenches would be covered up 
by this weekend or possibly next 
weekend.
Capital Campaign continues
continued from page 1
paign began immediately after the 
last one ended. The Master Plan in 
1985 was a major factor in the im
plementation of the Capital Cam
paign.
There is a goal of $46 million for 
capital improvements, which ac
cordingto the Master Plan, includes 
the east campus project, the Mar
garet Morrison Carnegie Hall reno
vation and addition, the Physical 
Plantbuilding, the Graduate School 
of Industrial Administration addi
tion, the Electronic Materials Tech
nology Building, and the Univer
sity Center.
One problem that most people 
were concerned with is cost over
runs. Brannick said, the contracts 
(that Carnegie Mellon has with the 
East Campus project) are guaran
teed minimum prices, the contracts 
build in contingencies so the project 
will not come in over budget.

clude campus organizations who 
wish to sell things during Carni
val.
Anne Witchner, Director of 
Student Activities, will be help
ing the Carnival Committee with 
the arts and crafts as well as with 
other aspects of Carnival.
The trend of Carnival in the 
past ten years has been one of 
gradual expansion. With the 
construction on campus, the en
tire event will become more com
pact and, as Levy pointed out, 
more manageable.
Security problems at Carnival 
are predominantly caused by nonUniversity people and the smaller 
nature of Carnival will perhaps 
be safer for the campus commu
nity.
Though students and adminis
trators have been workingfor two 
months, most of the planning 
remains to be done for this year 
Carnival.
There will be a need for new 
students to fill out committees, 
and even a few executive posi
tions are still empty. Were look
ing for people who really want to 
take on a challenge, said Levy.
For people interested Spring 
Carnival, weekly meetings are at
9 am on Friday mornings in Skibo 
Room 112.
Levy stated that several assis
tant positions need to be filled, 
and, also, stated that some execu
tive Carnival Committeepositions, like Entertainment, are 
currently open.
A more general organizational 
meeting will be held next semes
ter, in January and there is the 
possibility of a Winter Activities 
Fair at which students interested 
in Carnival can learn more about 
it.
the Pittsburgh Press, CMU 
Treasurer Edward Hunia said ... 
the University will use a $55 mil
lion loan for projects on its east 
campus, .. and a physical plant 
building. But, according to the 
recent estimates the two projects 
only total $39 million. There was 
a discrepancy of $16 million.
Brannick explained the loan 
was not just for the two projects 
but for several capital improve
ments.
Also, Brannick clarified that the 
new parking lot and dormitory 
are self-liquidating. They will 
eventually pay for themselves. 
Only the Physical Plant building 
and the playing fields will actu
ally be paid by the campaign.
On Monday, November 14, the 
Board of Trustees will meet for 
their annual meeting.Brannick 
said one of the topics that will be 
stressed at this years meeting is 
the Capital Campaign.
A number of Trustees and Ex 
Officio members of the Develop
ment and Planning Committee 
will bring their strategy to the 
Boardforfurther implementation 
of the campaign.
Brannick must present the fund 
raising plan to the Board of Trus
tees. He explained, it is tough to 
raise money for the bricks and 
mortar. Brannick has a profes
sional staff, trustees, faculty and 
alumni working on raising the 
money.
The problem is the significant 
gifts cannot be used as you want. 
People usually donate money to 
the University for a specific pur
poses, and not always what the 
University wants.

allowed to pay outsiders.
After the questions from stu
dents had been exhausted, 
Jainchill mentioned some of the 
recent topics which the Senate 
has had to consider. Two of these 
topics were how to strike the 
proper balance in funding politi

The first instance of the

Tuesday, stated Everhart.
The virus apparently origi

Wisconsin. At first, Everhart 
stated that it was thought to

Everhart fells that that

According to an article in 
Sundays New York Times, the 
virus was created at Cornell by 
Robert Tappan Morris Jr., a

The article stated that 
friends of Tappan have ex
plained that the virus was an 
accident and not ^intended to 
cause any damage; it was 
merely supposed to copy itself

numerical error, it spread at a

CMU signs agreement with Cray
Cm pinfp db yvSih
Tartan Staffwriter
In a recent move which will 
naintain Carnegie Mellons posi,ion at the forefront of computing 
echnology, the Pittsburgh Super:omputing Center has signed a 
30 million contract with Cray 
Research, Inc.
On August 11, the PSC, a joint 
)roject of Carnegie Mellon, the 
Jniversity of Pittsburgh, and 
Vestinghouse Electric Corpora;ion, announced that it has negoiated a contract with Cray which 
will allow it to replace its current 
>ay X-MP/48 supercomputer 
with the state-of-the-art Y-MP/ 
132.
The contract also specifies that 
;he PSC will receive the new Cray) supercomputer, scheduled for 
elease in late 1990.
The Y-MP, introduced in Feb
ruary, will replace the centers XVIP in December.
The new computeristhree times 
as powerful as the X-MP, with 
four times the memory. No other 
general purpose system offers the 
performance levels available from 
he Cray Y-MP system, com
mented John Rollwagen, chairnan of Cray.
The PSC will be receiving the 
iixth Y-MP in existence, the first 
shipped to a non-government 
institution.
The Cray-3, still in the prelimi
nary prototype stages, is expected 
to be at least 10 times more pow
erful than the X-MP, with 64 times 
the memory. It will be much 
smaller than current supercom
puters.
The Cray-3 will also be the first 
commercial supercomputer to 
utilize gallium arsenide circuitry 
instead of the more common sili
con microchips.
The PSC was established in 
1986 by the National Science 
Foundation as one of five nation
wide centers designed to provide 
American researchers with high
speed computing resources. 
Similar centers are found at Cor
nell University, the University of 
Illinois, Princeton University, and 
the University of San Diego.
According to PSC Executive 
Director Beverly Clayton, the 
changes will allow the center to 
continue pulling the research of 
the country forward.
Carnegie Mellon President 
Richard Cyert stated, Its a bold 
and absolutely necessary advance 
for the national science effort... 
With the Y-MP and the Cray-3, 
we have the tools not only to hold 
our own in the crucial economic 
battles for new technologies, but 
we have a chance to move ahead 
and to enhance American superi
ority.
This contract guarantees that
the highest standard of scientific 
computing in the world is in Pitts
burgh, added ALCOA Vice Presi
dent for Research and Develop
ment Peter Bridenbaugh, chair
man of the centers board of in
dustrial affiliates.
Funding for the PSC comes from 
the National Science Foundation, 
the Commonwealth of Pennsyl
vania, the Ben Franklin Partner
ship Fund, Cray Research, Inc., 
Digital Equipment Corporation, 
ALCOA, and other computer 
vendors and industrial affiliates.

his idea. He submitted that the 
People most capable for initiatlng that discourse would be stu
dents and teachers in our univer
sities.
Schwartz stated, What I think 
is unethical, I assert, is to ignore, 
0r to avoid, or to trivialize, or to 
s on to others, the responsiDility to make an informed and 
considered choice whether or not 
to contribute ones knowledge in 
the development of more weap
onry.
After his lecture, Schwartz 
distributed copies of a pamphlet 
.e wrote concerning the current 
Jb market in the engineering
eld.
The pamphlet reflects his con
cerns that most physics/engineer
ing students are unwittingly 
headed for a weapons-related 
career, and that teachers are 
neglecting their responsibilities 
to inform students about this 
trend.
Copies of Schwartzs pamphlet 
are available in the Engineering 
and Public Policy office in Baker 
Hall.
The lecture was sponsored by 
PUGWASH, the Graduate Stu
dent Organization (GSO), and the 
Program for Technology and So
ciety.
The speech was the first of a 
two-part series, called Science, 
Universities, the Military, and 
You, dealing with the role and 
future of defense-related research 
here at Carnegie Mellon Univer
sity and at universities in gen
eral.
Provost Angel Jordan was 
scheduled to deliver the second 
lecture of the series, defending 
the benefits of military-related 
research at universities, last 
night.

FOCUS
Not the same old story
Its the same old story  stu
dents blowing off classes to wait 
in line for registration  with the 
same old solution  deal with it 
until the registrar gets his new 
computer.
Well, were tired of waiting in 
line and were tired of waiting for 
the registrars mythical, magical 
computer. Lets face it, by the time 
campus-wide registrationis auto
mated, most of us will have gradu
ated.
Given that, we need to fi nd short
term fixes within the current 
system which will reduce the time 
spent out of class waiting in line.
The most obvious thing to do 
would be to cancel classes on reg
istration day. The current system 
forces students to skip class to 
stand in line. Why, then, is regis
tration day considered part of the 
academic Calendar?
Further, since some depart
ments  notably English  are 
now considering attendance as 
part of students final grades, 
students are hit with a double
whammy when they blow off class. 
The instructor docks their grades 
and they miss any information 
disseminated in class. Not cool.
In addition, if classes were 
cancelled, our advisors would be 
available registration day for last 
minute consultations. Many 
times, when classes are filled, 
students simply take the first 
thing that fits into their sched
ules without considering the rele
vance of the course to their major.
Finally, cancelling classes would 
also free faculty members. That 
way, if students have questions 
about particular courses curric
ula, faculty members will be avail
able.
While cancelling classes would 
help with registration, it would by 
no means solve the whole prob
lem. Moreover, The Tartan has 
written several editorials about 
registration over the last year, yet 
no changes have been made. In 
order to make a difference, Dick 
Rainsberger, the registrar, has to 
start listening.
Todays the day to vote!
Tuesday, November 8. That date 
ring any bells? Wonder what it is 
youve forgotten to do today be
sides that physics problem set and 
going to see your advisor? Thats 
right, its time to vote.
Not now, you say. You havent 
got time to walk five blocks down 
Fifth or stand in line in Skibo just 
to vote. Youve got classes all day, 
and have to go to work this eve
ning. Forget it, you think, how 
you vote isnt going to make any 
difference anyhow.
No dice guys. Skip that Kiltie
lunch, turn off those soaps, tell 
youremployeryoullbe late. What 
happened on General Hospital, 
or whether you showed up to work 
ten minutes late wont make any 
difference a year, a month, a week 
or probably even a day from now. 
But, whether you vote now could 
effect your life for the next four 
years, and probably even longer.
So grab a few friends, pack a 
sack lunch and head down to your 
polling place. If nothing else, at 
least go to cancel out the vote of 
your obnoxious suitemate.
Whos afraid of the big, bad bomb?
When Carnegie Mellons Gay 
and Lesbian Alliance (GALA) 
sponsored a dance on campus last 
March, Skibo had to be evacuated 
because the dance was the appar
ent target of an anonymous bomb 
threat.
This semester, rather than fear 
similar asinine behavior, GALA 
used the bomb threat as a theme 
for its latest dance. Dubbed The 
Duck and Cover Dance, Fridays 
dance was a moderate success, 
attracting nearly 100 people to 
the Wherrett Room, according to 
GALA member Roy Conard.
In our view, however, the event
ooo
Mom posters werent authorized
Editor;
Last weeks Tartan editorial [Mudslinging gets everyone dirty, 11/1] took 
an objective look at campaign proceed
ings here on campus. We would like to 
clarify, however, the use of the . .mom, 
apple pie, and the flag... poster. This 
advertisement was created and distrib
uted by one member of our group, and 
the statements expressed therein were 
his own. This type of propaganda is not 
viewed by our organization as being 
conducive to a responsible campaign.
The College Republicans, like the Col
lege Democrats, is a national organiza
tion, and at the time that the poster was 
drawn up our chapter was still in its 
organizational stages. In any event, 
though the message on the poster may 
have been inane and unintelligent, it 
could hardly have been construed as 
mudslinging. The brunt of our adver
tisements took the form of fliers an
nouncing the date and time of our meet
ings. These announcements were not
Letters to the Editor
posted, but rather distributed through 
campus mail to those who expressed an 
interest in our group.
It is the aim of our organization to be a 
forum for the discussion and prolifera
tion of Republican views. Your editorial 
stated that students are . .not trying to 
educate one another about the issues at 
hand or the respective party platforms. 
The basic format of our meetings is an 
open forum, and any member (or walk-in 
for that matter) may express his/her 
opinions and suggestions. It has been 
our policy to specifically avoid any re
semblance of negative campaigning, and 
our conduct throughout the campaign 
has demonstrated this.
The percentage of Americans who do 
not vote is staggering. In the 1960 presi
dential election the percentage of eli
gible voters who actually exercised that 
right reached an all-time modem high of 
63.1%. This is particularly disparaging 
in light of the fact that the total was only 
53.3% in 1984. We believe that as the 
public is better informed they will conse
quently become more involved  this 
has been the major thrust of our work, 
Toward this end we have handed out 
literature and information packets 8 
the voter-registration tables which out
lined the platform ofVice President Bush 
as well as information stating the posi
tions of both candidates as the literaturt 
was made available to us.
While we feel very strongly about oui 
political convictions, we realize that the 
most important thing is for people to be 
informed, so that they can vote wit 
decisiveness, and more important^ 
intelligence.
Randy L. Udavcak 
Publicity Director,
The College Republicans
Dems take exception to editorial
was much more than a moderate 
success. By sponsoring their 
dance, the members of GALA 
showed a hell of a lot of character. 
Not only did they face the nor
mal prejudices of which they are 
victims, they overcame the ex
tremely violent ignorance that 
prompted an unfounded bomb 
threat last year.
Unfortunately, until Carnegie 
Mellons homosexual community 
is accepted, GALA will have to 
continue Ducking and Covering.
We can only hope that GALA 
members never fear the big, bad 
bomb.

Editor:
I am writing this letter in lieu of my 
usual column because I was extremely 
upset by last weeks Tartan editorial 
[Mudslinging gets everyone dirty, 11/ 
1]. In the editorial, The Tartan editorial 
board has done a terrible disservice to 
both the College Democrats and the 
College Republicans. The editorial has 
also unjustly ignored the legitimate 
debate which has clearly dominated the 
activities of political organizations on 
campus.
Skipping over the irrelevant, inaccu
rate and unrepresentative descriptions 
given of selected College Democrat and 
College Republican activities, we come 
to the heart of the editorial. The prob
lem with all of this lies in the fact that as 
college students, we are not trying to 
educate one another about the issues at 
hand or the respective party platforms. 
This is blatantly incorrect.
The College Democrats have set up a 
table on campus twelve times. During
thebeginningofthe semester these tables 
answered questions and registered over 
four hundred students to vote. In the last 
several weeks the Democrats table has 
been freely distributing Dukakis posi
tion papers on a variety of issues.
We have also sent copies of position pa
pers to relevant organizations on cam
pus. Dukakis position on Central Amer
ica was sent to Educational Action on 
Latin America, Dukakis position on 
South Africa and Apartheid was distrib
uted at the Donald Woods lecture, and 
Dukakis position on womens rights and 
abortion have been shared with both the 
Womens Issue Collective and the Asso
ciation for Life.
I, as president of the College Demo
crats, aggressively worked to make sure 
students who desired to hear Dukakis 
speak could do so. The College Demo
crats provided transportation for close to 
ahundred students to attend the Dukakis 
rally in McKeesport and again provided 
transportation for the rally downtown.
We also aggressively pursued speak 
ers to address students on the issues 
this vital campaign. To this extent w 
brought Ted Mondale to speak as Mic 
west Political Director of the Dukaki 
Campaign and successfully sought th 
return of Paul Simon to our campus. W 
also took partin the early organization! 
the ECE Forum debate which, while nc 
well attended, was extremely inform! 
tive.
Now to the editorials complaints. Yoi 
first comment, on the College Democra 
t-shirts, is nonsense. How can a t-shit 
illustrate or state how the Dukaki 
Bentsen ticket is the best way to vote 
Should we have printed Dukakis pos 
tion papers on them?
The t-shirt is meant to be a politic 
statement and a rallying point for tho 
of us supporting Dukakis and those ofi 
upset with the current administrate 
While the shirt is definitely showing 
disgust with Vice President Bush, 
THEARENew HE uate8:
Religion is alive and well at CMl
Editor:
The 18 October edition of The Tartan 
was striking in the attention it gave to 
religion on the CMU campus. In the 
nearly four and a half years that I have 
been involved in campus ministry here, 
I believe this is the most space this as
pect of campus life has received. I sup
pose we have Cliffe Knechtle and his 
Hyde Park oratory to thank for that.
However, I am writing with three 
purposes; first, to offer a correction to the 
listing of Campus religious (sic) organi
zations which accompanied the articles; 
second, to offer a perspective on Cliffes 
representation of Christianity; and fi
nally, to make an observation concern
ing the variety of views on religion ex
pressed by CMU students.
First, the correction. It is not clear to 
me where the listing printed in The 
Tartan originated, but it is significantly 
deficient. In The Word (the freshman 
handbook) and in a variety of other uni
versity publications, as well as in the 
1988-1989 Campus Ministry Directory 
published by the CMU Campus Ministry 
Council there aije listed several other
campus ministry organization not men
tioned in The Tartan. These are: 
Baptist Campus Fellowship 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day 
Saints
ContinUUm (Unitarian-Universalist) 
Church of the Ascension (Episcopal) 
Jehovah-El Shaddai Christian 
Fellowship
Orthodox Christian Fellowship 
Roman Catholic Oratory 
The omission of these campus minis
try programs from The Tartan signifi
cantly reduces the evidence of the forms 
in which religion is alive and well on 
the CMU campus. The absence of the 
Roman Catholic Oratory is especially 
troublesome since student surveys show 
th at the largest single group of Christian 
students on the CMU campus (more than 
25%) identify with the Roman Catholic 
tradition. Further, the Oratory celebrates 
Mass weekdays in Skibo and on Satur
days and Sundays in GSIA. It makes you 
wonder how so active a religious pres
ence on the CMU campus could be over
looked by The Tartan.
Second, a comment on Cliffes repre
sentation of Christianity. I had a char 
to hear Cliffe a couple of times duringt 
campus visitation and I was struck 
how much he sounded like a salesmai 
for a generic product. It did not seem 
me that Cliffe acknowledged that thi 
were any other forms of Christian 
than the sort of conservative evangel! 
Protestantism which he represented^
I think represented very well). This 
not the place for a long discourse on t 
history of Christianity, but suffice it 
say that when a person says that tn 
are a Christian, it is still not very < 
what they believe. It is simply the 
that there is no generic ChristianityEven so, I can offer a rather gei'e 
definition of what a Christian is. Firs' 
is somebody who if you ask them if' 
are Christian, they say Yes. Secon 
is somebody for whom Jesus of Nazar^^ 
is central in their understanding* By 
meaning of their living in this v/oi 
Third, it is someone who identifies 
and participates in some particular 
toric Christian community.
This definition still doesnt tell usfl

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  8 November 19889
just a running mateRest of school should follow English 
Departments registration example
The Carnegie Mellon Under
graduate Catalog and the 
Spring Schedule of Classes have 
been the two most popular books 
on campus the past few days. 
Everywhere you look students 
are flipping back and forth from 
one to the other, trying to figure 
out which courses they have to 
take, which courses they can 
take, and which courses are 
actually offered at a time 
when they can take them.
Its registration time at 
CMU.
Its the time for students 
to go to their advisors and 
ask what to do. And time 
for students to be unable 
to get an appointment with 
their advisor. When this 
happens students refer to 
the catalog. Lets do the 
same.
Lets pretend that were mm 
a Metallurgical Engineer
ing and Materials Science ma
jor. And lets say were trying to 
determine whether or not we 
have to take the course Intro
duction to Materials Science. 
We open the catalog, turn to 
page 93 and look down to the 
list of core courses. There it is, 
27-131, Introduction to Materi
als Science. Great. Then our 
eyes happen to stray over to the 
list of Other Technical Elec
tives. Whoa! Theres 27-131, 
Introduction to Materials Sci
ence. Theres a little asterisk 
that leads us down to the bot
tom of the list where we read 
21 [sic] -131 should be taken as 
a Freshman Elective. OK, 
then how come its listed as a 
core course? we ask ourselves.
So we go to our advisor and 
ask him. It is required, he 
tells us. OK. No problem, the 
book just must be confusing. 
But then we talk to our friend 
who is also a MEMS major who 
hasnt taken 27-131 and he says 
that his advisor told him that 
27-131 is not required and that 
he doesnt need to take it. Oh 
no! Were plunged into the
60 Coarse
Michael D.C. Drout
depths of confusion again. Is it 
required or isnt it? No one knows.
This confusion doesnt applyjust 
to MEMS majors. Either the cata
log has changed or someone gave
"English majors, how
ever, don't have to 
worry about dealing 
with the confusing 
and inaccurate 
[course] catalog...
me some seriously wrong infor
mation about getting a manage
ment minor. I remember reading 
that I could take either Marketing 
or Production or Finance; the 
catalog now reads that I have to 
take Marketing and Production. 
I also thought that Organizational 
Behavior was one of the electives. 
Not according to the new catalog. 
The new catalog lists Foundations 
of Law, Operations Research, 
Government and Business, and 
Cost Accounting. '
Whats going on? Why the con
fusion? One reason is that the 
degree requirements sections of 
the catalog are poorly organized. 
I certainly couldnt get away with 
turning in a document with refer
ences as confusing as those in the 
MEMS requirements in either my 
professional writing classes or in 
my job as a professional writer. 
Why the lowered standards for 
the catalog? Perhaps because only 
students use it? Your guess is as 
good as mine.
English majors, however, dont 
have to worry about dealing with 
the inaccurate and confusing cata
log. Why? Because when English
majors talk to their advisors, 
their advisors have a nice little 
fill-in-the-blanks sheet that de
lineates all the degree require
ments. An English major, be
cause of this wonderful little 
sheet, knows exactly what 
courses to take and what they 
will count towards. This means 
that an English major  un
like our unfortunate MEMS
------ student  will never be
confused as to whether 
or not a specific course is 
required.
A solution? All depart
ments should follow the 
lead of the English de
partment and make up 
these magical sheets for 
their students to fill in 
as they go through CMU. 
Ill even volunteer to 
photocopy my sheet and
SI mail it to every depart
ment head at CMU so 
that theyll know what it looks 
like. Then they wont have to 
form a committee to design one.
Use of this sheet would go a 
long way towards reducing the 
confusion and stress that seem 
to go hand in hand with regis
tration at CMU. Everyone 
would benefit, especially fresh
men and sophomores who have 
AP credits and are thus a little 
ahead. Since these students 
dont have real advisors (in 
H&SS they dont even have 
majors) they can be easily con
fused by the catalog. Having 
the magic form would prevent 
this.
Although it is too late to im
plement this change this se
mester, lets get a move on and 
try to get it instituted as soon 
as possible. It will be a good 
first step towards making reg
istration at Carnegie Mellon 
less of a living hell.

last week before Election Day. 
George Bushs people are no ex

is one of the best political han

for getting the date of Pearl Har

kicking the ball through the goal 
posts.
We were sitting in the bar and 
he said, I suppose youre won

I replied, I dont believe a 
newspaperman should inquire 
into a politicians business.
We intend to take care of the 
Quayle problem once and for all, 
Rovere said.
Im ready if you are, I told 
him.
Rovere looked around the room 
\ and then said, Bush is going to 
adopt Dan Quayle as his son. 
Before the election? I asked. 
The news will wipe Dukakis 
off the networks. He wont be able 
to get a sound bite on a cable 
station in Butte, Mont.

Hostages,
Following is the first in a twopart series by English Professor 
Jim Kavanagh  Ed.
: A few weeks ago, I wrote of the 
 ability of the most reactionary 
sectors to control the countrys 
ideological discourse, keeping it 
within strictly defined limits, and 
of how so-called liberal media 
and politicians deliberately ignore 
issues that threaten to disrupt 
i the tight liberal-conservative con
sensus. These remarks were 
probably dismissed by many read
ers who maintain the charming 
belief that they are citizens of a 
truly open democracy, kept 
so by fierce combat between 
radically opposite political 
parties and the investiga
tive zeal of staunchly inde
pendent (if somewhat too 
liberal) media. Only the 
most tragically cynical could 
agree with the line of a Burt 
Reynolds character in one of 
. my favorite movies  that Amer( ica isnt quite the democracy its 
. cut out to be, but just another 
banana republic. Guatemala with 
8 color television. So, to indicate 
{ how well controlled American 
ideological life actually is, I would 
j like to discuss an issue that has 
;i been ignored by all sides in this 
s election, even though it touches 
on one of the most controversial 
; political episodes in recent years. 
,( What, you might ask, could 
ji possibly be more important than 
3 the Pledge of Allegiance, the Mas-f
ichusetts furlough program, or 
an Quayles college transcript?
. ow about American hostages? 
Yes, were talking here about what 
American ideology has defined as 
>ne of the most heinous crimes of 
inodern times  the involuntary

(since all Americans are innocent

will be obvious. Its because 
Quayle is his son.
There has never been a fatherson relationship like that in the 
White House. Was it hard selling 
it to Bush?
Not very. We explained to him 
that by adopting Quayle, the vot
ers will see the warm, compas
sionate side of Bush that he has 
been hiding since the campaign 
started. Also, this allows George 
to deal directly with the Presi
dent Quayle issue. When people 
see them together as father and 
son, it will make the country feel 
less nervous that Quayle is a 
heartbeat away from the White 
House.
Does Quayle want to be 
adopted?
He doesnt mind, provided the 
Bush people dont assign handlers 
to him to tell him how he should 
behave as a son.
This has the makings of a news 
story. When are you going to 
announce it?
In a day or two. We want to get

This is certainly an astounding 
charge, and should not be ban
died about in the respectable, 
objective, dispassionate American 
media unless there is some evi
dence to support it (as opposed to 
charges regarding a candidates 
sexual life, psychiatric history, 
religious habits, astrological be
liefs, or affinity for criminals and 
rapists, which can be bandied 
about at will). Before I outline the
evidence supporting this charge, 
so you can decide if its signifi
cant, lets reflect a bit. If there is 
credible prima facie evidence that 
some such deal was made, or even 
considered, it is surely an even 
more astounding fact that no 
major commercial news organi
zation, despite all their reputed 
zeal and liberalism, has ever men
tioned this evidence to the Ameri
can people, let alone investigated 
it. If there is such evidence, it is 
surely astounding that suppos
edly rabid liberals (Dukakis, or 
maybe Dan Rather) have never 
mentioned it to further their own 
political interests, since it would 
severely damage the conservative 
camp they are said to oppose so 
radically. In short, if there is such 
evidence, and you havent heard 
it, its a strange free press and a 
strange liberalism that help to 
ensure the vibrancy of our demo
cratic political debate.
If such a deal was actually made 
or considered, then the implica
tions about the American politi
cal process as a whole are quite 
damning. It would mean that the 
whole of American politics, in
cluding the most seemingly sin
cere reactionary camp, is driven 
by nothing so much as sheer, 
cynical opportunism. It would 
mean that the rhetoric of the elec
toral process is a complete sham, 
that the American electorate is 
treated as a bunch of fools, and 
that the real determinants of the 
political process, including the 
slimiest of deals with enemy 
governments, are hidden from our 
eyes.
Indeed, since I find that there is 
significant evidence here, I would 
suggest that it has not been re
ported by mainstream media or 
liberal politicians just because
was the most qualified son a Presi
dent could have.
Its good, I said, and its good 
because its true. I have nothing 
but admiration for the way you 
people have handled this cam
paign. And having Bush adopt 
the vice-presidential candidate as 
his son is the final stroke of gen
ius. When did you decide about 
this?
Rovere ordered another drink. 
The trick in politics is to do the 
unexpected. When Quayles mili
tary record was exposed, every
one expected Bush to drop him. 
We decided to have him adopt 
Dan instead, because no one could 
complain if a father didnt want 
his son to go to war.
What puzzles me is that with 
the polls showing Bush so far 
ahead, why would George want 
another son?
Because although he has sev
eral of his own, there is nobody 
quite like Dan Quayle.
J. Danforth Quayle Bush has a 
nice ring to it, I told Rovere.
He said, The adoption wont af
fect the true believers, but when 
the undecideds see George carry
ing Quayle on his shoulders, 
theyll be so moved that they will 
give Bush a landslide.

they want to protect the Ameri
can political process from the ef
fects of such a disclosure: the 
charge might prove to be true, or 
the evidence so great that many 
will believe it. That is, liberals 
and the media do not want to pro
mote the radical disaffection with 
normal American politics that 
would inevitably result from such 
a disclosure. That is, they all see 
their primary task as protecting 
the liberal-conservative politicsas-usual normality, even when 
that means denying their sup
posed professional integrity as in
vestigative journalists, or 
hurting their political selfinterest and protecting the 
conservative forces they 
are thought to oppose.
Even to claim that the 
liberal press is just too 
scared to touch this issue 
unless it can be absolutely, 
positively proven is to recog
nize that the media is in fact con
trolled, by intimidation at least, 
by the most reactionary sectors.

My, what a degree from Carne
gie Mellon can do for you. An 
honorary degree, that is.
Look  former Pennsylvania 
Governor Dick Thornburgh gets 
an honorary degree from here in 
May and two months later he is 
the Attorney General of the 
United States.
But wait, theres more  Leon 
Lederman, the Director of the 
Fermi National Accelerator LaboEric W. Leuliette
ratory, also got an honorary de
gree during graduation. Then in 
October he won the Nobel Prize in 
Physics.
Coincidences? I dont think so.
So a degree from CMU must be 
the path to success, right?
But what about all of the stories 
we hear about famous people who 
started here but never finished? 
Andy Warhol, Steve McQueen, 
and Blair Underwood, to name a 
few.
Maybe the degree is a good thing 
to get, but spending four (or more) 
years here is a jinx. Ted Danson 
only spent two years here; thats 
how he avoided the jinx. Jeff 
Zaslow dropped out for a week, 
now hes a big-time syndicated 
columnist.
But whats the CMU jinx? The 
wacky weather? The odd school 
colors?
No, its the draining work and 
the long sleepless nights. And its 
not just the school work. The 
recreation here can be just as 
grueling: buggy, newspaper, 
APhiO, Senate committee meet
ings, and Scotch n Soda.
Four years is just long enough 
to drain all of the stamina out of 
even the most ambitious student. 
By the time we graduate, were 
ready to relax. When a Carnegie 
Mellon student gets out into the 
real world, he finds that programt think so
ming deadlines arent midnight 
on Fridays.
How many of your friends have 
complained that theyve had 
trouble getting motivated lately? 
CMU is supposed to attract stu
dents who are self-motivators. 
Whats happened to them since 
they got here?
Its like students in Japan. They 
kill themselves in high school and 
then blow off their college years. 
We just go through the same thing 
a little later in life.
How can you become a famous 
person if your ambition has been 
nixed? Look at Steve Jobs, the 
brains behind Apple computers 
and NeXT. Because he didnt 
graduate from college, one com
puter analyst suggested that his 
success comes from not knowing 
what is impossible.
Im not suggesting that a four 
year stint will hurt your future. 
Many alumni are doing well as 
corporate vice presidents or sen
ior researchers. Most are just not 
spectacular.
My suggestion for success is that 
you drop out of school while you 
still can, contribute a million 
bucks to CMU, and ask for an 
honorary degree. It may be the 
only way to make a success out of 
your life.

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  8 November 1988
Cliffe and Columbus not in the same boat when it comes to God
THEARENew soHc uate I
about what a Christian believes 
either in general or in particular. 
Exactly how Jesus functions in 
their understanding and what 
community they identify with and 
participate in determines what 
kind of Christian they are. In 
Christianity there are only brand 
_ names; there are no generics. And 
there are a whole lot of brands.
Unfortunately, Cliffe did not 
seem to acknowledge this. He of
fered his brand as though it were 
_the only brand and thereby 
.he distorted the richness of 
.and tension within the Chris
tian heritage.
And a word on Cliffes 
sales technique. A good 
salesman always begins with 
the assumption that his 
product is the best that there 
is and is not only flawless but 
.also just what the customer 
.needs to make his or her life 
complete. Clearly, this was 
Cliffes attitude toward Chris
tianity. As the excerpt from  
Cliffes book indicates with
out his brand of Christianity, 
human life regardless of its afflu
ence is hollow and empty and 
bent toward self-destruction.
Of course, Jews, Moslems, Hin
dus, and Buddhists might make 
very similar claims for their 
brands of religious tradition. Cer
tainly, to any casual observer 
persons within these traditions 
seem to live creative, fulfilled, and 
even self-sacrificial lives. Further, 
.even the most cursory reading of 
.Western history shows that real, 
concrete Christianity is not withLetters to the Editor
out its warts or darker side (need 
I mention the Crusades, the In
quisition, Afrikaners, or contem
porary TV evangelists).
But Cliffes focus was on the 
sale, the persuasion of his cus
tomer to buy his product. He 
was not apparently interested in 
exploring the rich diversity of the
[Cliffe] offered his 
brand as though it 
were the only brand 
and thereby distorted 
the richness of and 
tension within the 
Christian heritage...
tradition within which he stands 
including those portions with 
which he might be in fundamen
tal disagreement (e.g., the Soci
ety of Friends or Roman Catho
lics or Coptic Christians or theo
logically liberal Protestants). He 
was not apparently interested in 
inquiring after how other nonChristian faith traditions provide 
their adherents vtfith frameworks 
of meaning for contemporary 
human living and how these 
frameworks compare with Chris
tianity.
It is because of this salesman 
approach that I think Cliffes 
presentation of Christianity is an 
unfortunate one especially within 
a university setting. And this 
brings me finally to my last point, 
an observation on the views on 
religion expressed by CMU stu
dents. The observation is this: 
religion is something about which 
nearly everyone is able to offer a 
ready opinion and yet very few 
people actually have a refined 
knowledge of their own or any 
_ other religious heritage.
For example, some of those 
offering comments thought 
that religion has to do with 
questions about God (though 
there are some religious tra
ditions which are non-theistic). Others thought that reli
gion was primarily a matter 
of belief (though there are good 
reasons to believe that every 
human enterprise from art to 
astrophysics is grounded in 
some set of assumptions or 
- non-tested beliefs).
Some held that religion was 
primarily a personal matter 
(though I do not know of a single 
explicit religious view that doesnt 
stand in some relationship to the 
tradition of a human community). 
Still others said that religion has 
to do with matters not of this 
world but instead with matters of 
eternity (though Judaism, Chris
tianity, and Islam have all had 
significant social, political, and 
economic impacts on the shape of 
Western culture).
Jeff Fartro compares Cliffe with 
Columbus and notes that many of
the leading figures in Western 
and American history had affili
ations with some Christian com
munity [Cliff and Columbus, 10/ 
25]. But such affiliation does not 
mean they they shared much in 
the way of common beliefs. Plac
ing Columbus, Pascal, Newton, 
and T.S. Eliot together makes 
sense at a certain level of abstrac
tion, but obscures the distinctive 
religious perspectives of each.
Twin motives of Roman Catho
lic evangelicalism and economic 
imperialism which were combined 
in much of colonization of South
ern and Central America was a 
source of misgiving even for Co
lumbus. Pascals faith wager is 
prudent only if it can be assumed 
that believing in the particular 
kind of God that Pascal did be
lieve in had no ill effects for the 
society in which such belief was 
dominant. Certainly the Inquisi
tion and the Salem witch trials,
both sanctioned on religious 
grounds, gives pause to that as
sumption.
Issac Newtons Unitarianism 
made him eccentric not only 
within the dominant Trinitarian 
Protestantism of 17th century 
England but also most main
stream Christianity (Protestant 
or Roman Catholic) of 20th cen
tury America. Lincoln was a 
nominal Protestant Christian but 
it is interesting that most of the 
religious allusion in his speeches 
and writing were to Hebrew scrip
tures. And it is doubtful that T.S. 
Eliot (though his brand of Chris
tianity was a relatively traditional 
one) would have been an enthusi
astic member of Jerry Falwells 
Liberty Baptist Church. It is just 
too simplistic to put persons who 
identified themselves as Chris
tian into one neat theological or 
religious basket.
We all have common sense
notions of what the world iJjk 
or what a computer is. But fg\y 0 
us would speak authoritative!; 
about quantum mechanics* o

vative cases, these personal,,^ 
sibilities stand in some relafcioi 
to the religious traditions of par

Why did the Contras kill Ben Linder?
!; , Last April, the Contras shot and 
killed Ben Linder, ag American 
i engineer, who was in Nicaragua 
 building a hydro-electric dam.
He and his Nicaraguan co-work;: ers were ambushed by a group of 
;; Contras near the rural village of 
; J San Jose De Bocay. After Linder 
!!. was immobilized by a shotgun 
blast to the back of his legs, he 
. was shot in the head at extremely 
close range.

Other Americans oppose the 
Sandinistas. Wealthy men, most 
notably Adolf Coors, the beer 
magnate, have donated large 
sums of money to the Contras.
I learned of Linders death just 
after a hurricane devastated parts 
of Central America, especially 
Nicaragua. The American govern
ment refuses to aid Nicaragua.
American death in Nica-mvragua.
.y, Just out of college, Ben 
/ii Linder went to Nicaragua 
- because he thought the 
Sandinistas offered him a 
... .chance to use his engineer./'ing skills to directly aid 
;< the poor. Throughout 1987-1988 
' he oversaw the construction of 
the first small hydro-electric plant 
|, in a remote part of Northern Nicaj! ragua. Since Nicaragua is criss11 crossed with small streams, small 
! hydro-plants promised rural Nica raguans a better life. Linders 
j project made electric light a realj ity, which made possible night 
;! classes for adults and children.
Life in rural Nicaragua was 
I hard. As a diversion for himself,
! i Linder continued his hobby of 
!  juggling and clowning. The week 
I before he died, he donned his
 clown costume to entice children 
  to get their measles shots.
j; Linders work made him unj; popular in Contra circles. They 
i; sent him a death threat. The 
| Contras (self-confessed) premedi! tated attack came just as Linder
I began preliminary work for a 
! second hydro-plant.
Linders death poses a dilemma 
j; for us all, both because of the way 
;  he died, and because of the way 
;; he lived. The paradox in his death 
J! is that while some Americans like 
\! Linder felt strongly enough to go
II to Nicaragua to work among the 
 poor, other Americans donated 
ii monies to the men who killed 
i Linder.
; President Reagan paints the 
; Sandinistas as Central American 
| Stalinists hell-bent on globalizing 
j a gulag-style government. Other 
I American citizens are skeptical.
< Some go to Central America to 
; see for themselves what the 
j| Sandinista government is all 
j; about. Some, like Linder, stay and 
!! undertake development work.

cant pull yourself up 
by your bootstraps un
less you have boots. 
can tradition, like the Ku Klux 
Klan, who hate to see others 
improve themselves. Rather than 
raise themselves up, they pull 
others down.
The issue of hurricane relief 
strikes deep to the heart of what 
it means to be an American. What 
will we do in Nicaragua? Will we 
build or destroy? I would encour
age you as Americans, to think 
about Ben Linder, and what we 
can do to help build peace in that 
troubled region. Research the 
issue for yourself. Once you know 
where you stand on these issues, 
 give of yourself.

The last time Nicaragua faced a 
natural disaster of these dimen
sions was in 1972, after an earth
quake devastated Managua. The 
city was never rebuilt, and most 
of the development money went 
to the dictators (Somozas) pock
ets. Say what you will about the 
Sandinistas, there is no evidence 
to assume the Sandinistas enrich 
themselves at the publics ex
pense, as did Somoza.
Learning about Linders death 
made me wonder about the di
verse motives of Americans in 
Nicaragua. Some might say Lin
der was an ideologue, a commu
nist. Linder admired the Sandin
istas because he sympathized 
with the long-neglected poor. He 
wanted kids to be able to read, to 
have a doctor when they got sick. 
Ben Linder knew you cant pull 
yourself up by your bootstraps 
unless you have boots. He fell 
within the tradition of Americans 
who helped raise their neighbors 
barns, not those who stand on 
soapboxes.
I dont understand affluent 
Americans, notably Adolf Coors, 
who fund the Contras, who deny 
Nicaraguan children electric light. 
Id think Adolf would want Nica
raguans to buy shares in a utility 
company, rather than destroying 
existing hydro-plants. Perhaps 
Coors cant find anything better 
to do with his money than fund 
the Contras. I always figured that 
most Americans, if they felt 
strongly enough to shoot engi
neers or blow up dams, would do 
it themselves. Men like Coors are

not true that Dukakis supporters

charge, supported by all this 
evidence, were made against 
some liberal, I think it would be 
more likely to be reported. Why? 
Because it would only help to 
further disaffection with so-called 
liberalism, already defined as 
suspect, and not with the politi
cal process as a whole. Similarly, 
if there were as much evidence 
about some sexual peccadillo of 
any candidate, its a good bet 
} there would be an incessant 
barrage of media interrogation 
and investigation. Non- standard 
sex is fair game for attention, 
since it doesnt reflect the corrup
tion of the entire political proc
ess, only of some individual.
Here, then, is some of the evi
dence regarding the ReaganBush campaign  including 
Bush himself  and American 
hostages during the 1980 elec
tion (Sources for this informa* tion are articles in The Nation of 
20 June, 4/11 July, 1/8 August, 
24 October, and 21 November
1987, and 19 September and 31 
October 1988, and Playboy, Oc
tober 1988):
1 In October 1980, polls showed
a close Presidential race; Time 
magazine gave Jimmy Carter a 
42-41 percent lead over Ronald 
Reagan. William Casey, Reagans 
campaign manager and CIA 
Director to be, became obsessed 
with the fear that Carter would 
pull off an October Surprise  
a last-minute release of the 
American hostages in Teheran, 
tipping the election in his favor. 
A Congressional investigation 
has in fact found that the Reagan-Bush campaign set up two 
special teams to war-game 
possible Carter moves and the 
formulation of coyntermoves 
regarding a hostage release. One 
team included Casey, Ed Meese, 
and retired Admiral Robert Gar
rick, while the other included 
Richard Allen (to become Na
tional Security Advisor), John 
Lehman (to become Secretary of 
the Navy), and Admiral Thomas 
Moore. Meese, Casey, James 
Baker, and Admiral Garrick all 
confirmed to a House committee 
that Garrick ran a private intel
ligence network  including 
active-duty military officersto 
keep the Reagan-Bush campaign 
informed of any moves toward
releasing the hostages (includ
ing military maneuvers and dis
positions of forces). For example, 
General Richard Ellis, then head 
of the Strategic Air Command, 
offered, according to Meeses 
notes, to help the Reagan cam
paign blow Jimmy Carter out of 
the water.
Casey and Allen also got help 
from CIA hands close to former 
CIA Director Bush, including the 
former Director of CIA Security 
under Bush and, according to one 
Reagan campaign staffer, activeduty CIA agents working for the 
Bush campaign. Through this 
impressive intelligence network, 
Casey and Allen had access to 
supposedly secret information of 
the highest security classifica
tions. These included Secret/ 
Sensitive and Top Secret  
Eyes Only documents directly 
from the US embassy in Teheran, 
found in Meeses files, with 
Reagans handwritten ac
knowledgement. Reagan, of 
course, could not remember how 
he got the documents. The House 
committee concluded that these 
copies were obtained from Iran 
after being in the possession of
Iranians. In general, the com
mittee found that Reagan-Bush 
campaign officials both sought 
and acquired nonpublic [cute!] 
Government and Carter-Mondale 
information and materials.
Now somebody might notice 
that this evidence alone identi
fies an outrageous, not to men
tion illegal, private intelligence 
apparatus, actually turning 
government employees, soldiers, 
and intelligence agents to spy on 
the United States government 
and steal its most closely-guarded 
secrets, in order surreptitiously 
to influence a Presidential elec
tion. (And it worked!) Somebody 
might notice that Ive referred to 
a House investigation, including 
admissions by the principals, 
which you have probably never 
heard of. Somebody might notice 
what doesnt get highly publi
cized as opposed to what does. 
Somebody might notice that this 
makes hash out of any idea of a 
zealous, investigative liberal 
press. And this is what weve got 
so far.

formance during the following 
two weeks, are sufficient for the 
student to make an informed 
decision concerning whether or 
not to drop a course. How can he 
say that the student is not receiv
ing enough feedback? He is re
ceiving all the feedback that he 
can get. The purpose of the mid
semester grades is to assess the 
performance of the student at 
'midsemester, not to predict (as a 
crystal ball might) what the 
students final grade would be.
And what of the poor A student 
who received a D the day after 
the drop deadline? S/he obviously 
made the wrong choice, if s/he 
was disappointed with his or her 
final grade. The student takes a 
calculated risk when he decides 
to keep a course he or she is 
uncertain of. (I recently took that 
risk). If it were a general trend 
for the students grades to plum
met the day after the deadline, 
then perhaps the deadline would 
be moved. The example that 
Drout cited, however, was more
Letters to the Editor
the exception than the rule.
There is a problem with his 
proposal to allow all students to 
drop a course all the way to the 
end of finals. Suppose there are 
100 students in a course that is 
graded on a bell curve (as many 
are). If the failing 10% all drop 
the course at the end of finals, 
then what of the remaining 90%? 
Should a student whos destined 
to pass with a D be curved to an 
R, just because all the Rs dropped 
the course? Also, is it fair to the 
remaining 90% if those who 
dropped at the last minute to 
avoid an R retook the course and 
received an A, with no record of 
their previous failing perform
ance? The QPA rankings within 
a department are supposed to be 
a fairly accurate reflection of the 
relative performance of the stu
dents: to allow haphazard drop
ping, as Drout suggests, would 
destroy that balance.
Its mostly out of fairness to the 
passing students that an R can
not have the same effect on QPA 
that a walk has on a batting 
average. However the students 
are welcome, and in some cases 
required, to Retake the course. It 
is also worthy to note that the

university does make an excep
tion to the drop deadline for those 
who are on an overload schedule.
Drouts proposal to replace the 
monstrous exams with more 
smaller exams also makes no 
practical sense. Instead of elimi
nating many all-nighters, such 
a program would increase the 
workload: if I had to study for a 
mini-exam every week for all of 
my classes, I would go nuts. More, 
smaller exams would also de
crease the educational value of 
the course in two ways: 1) It would 
be possible for students to cram a 
quiz every week and still have no 
concept of what the course is 
really teaching. The comprehen
sive exams we take now (and the
Killing time in line.
final) are dead ends for these 
crammers; 2) MORE, smaller 
exams would mean less lecture 
time, less material covered.
The next time Drout decides to 
express his opinion in public, he 
should think first of the conse
quences of realizing his propos
als. His column seems to have 
been written more our of a per
sonal grievance than a general 
proposal to eliminate all major 
exams, leaving readers wonder
ing whether he had a single wellthought proposal or whether he 
just needed some harmless way 
to vent his anger at the system.

When bad things 
happen to good ideas
Everyone is always talking 
about a program they would 
like to do on campus. Some of 
the people I know actually go 
out and do them. Sometimes 
those who do the events get a 
poor turnout. For example, 
Student Senate got together 
last Thursday to tell people 
about the activities fee. They 
wanted to tell them where the 
money goes. Only ten people, 
two of which were Tartan re
porters, cared enough to go 
while eight Senators were in 
the room.
I think the roundtable is a 
great idea, but if people arent 
going, theres something 
wrong. The same point has 
been raised about AB Dance. 
Events are taking place but 
not a lot of people are going to 
them. Why?
One idea that may be true is 
that people just don't care for 
the things that are going on 
around campus. But how do 
you explain the packed dance 
at Homecoming, Hoopla and 
the Billy Bragg concert?
Maybe the problem is with 
how the events are chosen. One 
person decides that the cam
pus would enjoy something and 
then asks his/her friends. 
Usually this means a group of 
five or ten but in some cases 
this is as many as forty or fifty 
people who give some input 
into decision. A statistician 
could give you the actual 
number needed, but I dont 
think that even fifty people 
would be enough to find out 
what the whole campus wants 
considering how diverse the 
student body is.
There should be a greater 
amount of input, a better way 
for finding out what students 
at Carnegie Mellon want. The 
best way of doing this is probaNever-ending Story 
Dave Levy
bly a survey, but this is where 
the crux of the true problem 
arises. Students at Carnegie 
Mellon will not take the time 
to tell those running things 
exactly what they would like 
to do and see. All it takes is a 
look at the last Senate election 
results to see that students do 
not take the time to put their 
input into things.
Sure, theyll tell the Activi
ties Board that they want to 
see U2 on campus or that they 
want to see Jay Leno, the 
comedian. Face it folks, if you 
want to see groups like that 
youd either be paying an Ac
tivities Fee of $200 a year or 
going to a school of 50,000 
students far away from any 
type of city whatsoever.
What is needed is yet an
other survey with real expec
tations by the students with 
possible alternatives given by 
the programmers. More impor
tant than this survey is that 
the students of Carnegie Mel
lon actually fill it out and re
turn it to those who are collect
ing the information.
We have had two groups 
mauling people for the past 
two months to register for 
todays election. If the same 
people-power could be raised 
to do this survey we might see 
a better turnout for almost all 
events.

major and a Contributing 
Editor for The Tartan., and

any bodys ideas to the proper 
authorities.
Things to do while waiting to register for classes
There are two things Carnegie 
Mellon students will wait on line 
for: brunch at Kiltie when the 
entire countrys Navy Reserves 
show up, and registration for 
their favorite classes.
Waiting on line to get into a 
Computer Science or English 
class has become a ritual second 
only to buggy on this campus. 
Some may feel this is because 
both can force a student to wake 
up at 5 am. I think that just like 
being a pledge will force you to 
sweep, being a student will make 
you at least once take a popular 
class.
Registration for spring semes
ter classes is tomorrow and sleep
ing bags can already been seen 
outside various departments. 
Every one on line has the same 
objective  avoid 8:30 classes at 
all costs.
Nothing can be done to stop 
registration, its as much a part 
of the Carnegie Mellon experi
ence as 7:30 exams and painted 
trees near the Fence.
Prepare for registration before 
you do it. Youve probably pre
registered the classes in your 
major, but there may be two or 
three other classes you need to 
get into. There are some classes 
you can probably put off until 
Thursday; no one has ever been 
locked out of Introduction to 
Material Science.
Look out for people who may 
want similar schedules; they are 
your competition. It shouldnt be 
very difficult to find out their free 
time, and make sure you register 
for the classes you want before 
they can.
Plan your schedule for contin
gencies. Theres a good chance 
that you will not get into the 
exact combination of classes that 
would give you no classes on 
Fridays. Know when non-painful classes are, especially when 
youre filling free electives, the 
time of a class is more important 
than the subject.
Unfortunately there are a few,

Sherlock schlock: Caine, Kingsley are completely TewvuNw E piNH
Py STEPHEN GLICKER
Tartan Staffwriter
Being Dr. John Watson of221-B Baker 
Street is not easy. He has to come up with 
fa way to hide his double life  as a sur;eon and sleuth  from the medical proession. What better way than to invent 
i detective named Sherlock Holmes and 
iise this imaginary person as a front to 
lolve crimes. Problems arise when the 
public clamors to meet Holmes in per;on. Dr. Watson solves this problem by 
jiiring a boozy, broken-down actor named 
Reginald Kincaid to play the role of the 
egendary detective.
Such is the setting of the new movie
Without a Clue, co-starring Academy 
Award winners Michael Caine and Ben 
Kingsley. Caine starts as the man who 
would be Holmes, and Kingsley stars as 
the surgeon turned sleuth Dr. Watson. 
Caine has starred in more than 60 major 
motion pictures during the past 25 years, 
including Alfie and Hannah and Her 
Sisters, for which he received an Acad
emy Award. Kingsley is best known for 
his Oscar winning portrayal of Indias 
historic leader Mohandas K. Gandhi in 
Richard Attenboroughs Gandhi.
Kincaids performance as Holmes can 
be described as shaky at best. He looked 
the partin his deerstalker cap and Inver
ness cape, but criminals terrified him,
clues confused him, dead bodies made 
him nauseous, and he had trouble re
membering his lines. However, the pub
lic adored him and eventually the fame 
went to his head.
While the good doctor was pondering 
the puzzle of the bungled break-in at the 
Royal Gallery, the arson fire at the paper 
mill, and the devout printer who went 
rowing in a rainstorm without his psalm 
book, Holmes told the press that the case 
was closed.
That did it.
Watson had no choice but to sack the 
simpleton and come out of the crimino
logical closet, proclaiming himself the 
Crime Doctor. Unfortunately, nobody
believes him except Professor Moriarty.
Moriarty (Holmes arch-enemy in the 
Conan Doyle works) takes Watson at his 
word. In fact, Moriarty is so convinced 
that Watson is the one responsible for 
foiling his nefarious plans that he ab
ducts the hapless Dr. Watson, planning 
to do away with him once and for all!
With this turn of events, Kincaid/ 
Holmes is forced back into the fray as he 
is called upon to solve the case ofWatsons 
kidnapping, and in the process track 
down the counterfeiters plaguing the 
duo from the start of the whole affair.
Unlike early film adaptations of Arthur 
Conan Doyles 56 stories and four novels, 
Without a Clue almost goes off the deep
end. It turns all the elements of th 
classic setting upside down. Holmes ac 
his part but never really knows what 
happening until Watson tells him 
Watsons character is finally broug] 
into the limelight and Holmes is tran 
formed into the shabby sidekick, all 
which puts the movie into a comedy 
adventure setting.
Orson Welles once said, Sherloc 
Holmes is a gentleman who never livec 
and will never die. In that spirit, 
should be fun to take a fresh look at 
legend and give it a contemporary twis

and Michael Caine, opens this week.
Portrait debuts new music
Jy STEWART LEVINE
\rtan Contributing Editor
Portrait Records, a revamped 
ivision of CBS Records, has a 
nission.
A new look. A new sound. A 
lew musical attitude inspired by 
irtists so special they dont fit a 
ategory. This is how the ad copy 
hat comes with each album reads. 
Veil, the first ix members of 
'ortraits catalog can be placed 
nto categories: some are blues, 
ome are jazz; some good, and 
jome bad.
The best of the six is from the 
onThomas Blues Band. Theres 
lothing new here, just very welllone blues. The band has two 
singers, but surprisingly 
Rough, the two instrumental 
>ieces Every Day I Haye The 
Hues and Dukes Place are two 
'fthe strongest on the album. 
The other standout of the group 
s the latest from Ornette Colenan and Prime Time. His 
[\b\im,Virgin Beauty, not only 
hows off the versatility of his 
ng-time band, but features 
fateful Dead member Jerry 
arcia on several of the cuts. The 
Kterplay between Colemans 
a*ophone and Garcias guitar on 
Desert Players must be heard. 
Thomas Langs Fingers & 
humbs is an uneven album that 
lQws Langs many jazz and 
vant-garde influences. Unfortuately, the combination works 
etter on some songs better than 
thers. Two songs, Me & Mrs. 
nes and Shoelaces (Mrs. Jones 
art 2) stand out, but many of 
le thers will simply fade into 
a^kground noise.
>y Enriquezs Wild Pianofall8 into some of the same traps.
If this bass could only talk: Stanley
All of the songs are covers, and 
Enriquez has trouble making a 
song his own. Some of the trouble 
may be because none of the tracks 
were performed in more than 
three takes. This method gives 
the album a bit more immediacy, 
but it does not allow Enriquez or 
his trio to explore songs like 
Round Midnight which have 
been covered by just about every
one.
Stanley Clarkes If This Bass 
Could Talk is unfortunately a 
disappointing effort. Clarke has 
been acknowledged as a master of 
the bass since he joined jazz group 
Return to Forever fifteen years 
ago. His two duets with Gregory 
Hines (Clarke on sax, Hines tap

Clarkes best friend, from the cover of his latest album.
dancing) are songs to behold.
However, the rest of the album 
falls flat and seems uninspired 
despite a list of guest artists in
cluding Stewart Copeland, Wayne 
Shorter, Freddie Hubbard, 
George Duke, and George How
ard. This album really could have 
used an outside producer to 
tighten the sound and say to 
Clarke every once in a while, No, 
Stanley, this is a bad idea.
Lastly, avoid T-Squares Truth. 
This Japanese quintet attempts 
to stake out territory that Weather 
Report defined over a decade ago. 
They suffer the same problem as 
Enriquez  theres no reason to 
listen to their album as opposed 
to any of the other hundred (or
thousand) artists doing the same 
type of material.
As a label, Portrait is as uneven 
as its releases. The recordings 
are all high-quality, but the cover 
art and liner notes are very un
even, ranging from a six-page 
(with the CD) essay by Stanley 
6rouch in one and a sparse list of 
songs and instruments in the 
other.
Portrait does fill a niche for 
CBS/Sony. None of the acts fit on 
their current labels, even though 
some jazz artists still record on 
the flagship Columbia label. The 
new Portrait label will open lis
teners ears and bring more acts 
to the general public, and that 
combination is always a win.
Junior Rep continues; 
PHAfEsw now playing
By LAURA MCILRATH
Tartan Staffwriter . .
This seasons Junior Rep production of Ibsens Hedda Gabler 
almost made itin many respects it was one of the finest of this 
seasons Junior Rep productions so far, but some of the technical 
decisions undermined the pcfwer of the play as a whole. The 
story centers around a woman\;dissatisfaction with her re
stricted place in society, and her attempts to amuse herself and 
exercise what power she does have by manipulating others.
The acting was excellent, and in every conversation it was 
obvious that there was something going on beneath th%surface. 
Michael Waller as the judge was a bit obvious in his leering at 
Hedda, but Brett Benner as Heddas husband was enough of an 
airhead that even the most blatant innuendo could slip by Him. 
Vanita Harbours Hedda Gabler was finely controlled, occasion
ally letting down her mask of social acceptability for the audi
ence, but always facing the other characters with the same sly 
but domineering nature.
Because so much of the play was so real, its a pity that the 
sappy music that started playing at moments of crisis made all 
the interesting moments ridiculous. When the music came up, 
the lights went down, sometimes almost completely, and the 
finely wrought realism of the play went out the window. While 
it was fascinating to watch Hedda burn the manuscript on a 
darkened stage, the occasional breaks from realism stuck out 
and seemed contrived. Ibsen is a master of realistic drama, and 
while most of the play was successful at giving us this realism, 
the moments where reality was abandoned sadly diminished 
the overall effect of the production.
Domestic Troubles: Servant of Two Masters
The next play to be produced in the 1988 Junior Rep season 
will be Carlo Goldonis Servant of Two Masters. The play was 
written in 1743, near the end of the reign of the Commedia 
DellArte in Italy. It is one of Goldonis most popular plays, 
especially in Britain. Servant concerns the classic situation of 
a wily servant manipulating his master except, in this case, the 
servant is controlling two masters, neither of which knows that 
he serves the other.
Like traditional works of the Commedia dellArte, Servant of 
Two Masters is a farce originally composed of the actors im
provisations built around a basic story line. Goldoni wrote the 
play as a vehicle for an actor friend, and only fleshed out the 
script- after the play had been running for quite some time.

Love in the afternoon with Burton and Joe Bob
Last week 1200 pages of Rich

released in The Star, The Inquirer, 
News of the World, the London 
Daily Mirror, the West German 
magazine Der Spiegel, the East 
German magazine Der Beagle, 
and South Louisiana Bass World 
Weekly. So when I heard about it 
there wasnt much left to 
buy, but I finally did come 
up with 200 bucks for pre
viously unpublished ex
cerpts from the Dickieloves-Lizzie books. I did it 
for you, the drive-in-going 
public of America.
8/17/64, Big Sur: We 
started the Sandpiper thing to
day. She stood on the beach in 
terry-cloth and I gazed transfixed 
at her calf, speckled with sand 
flecks. Her skin sparkled like 
bourbon, and I had to taste it. She 
is my speckled trout child woman.
9/14/64, Big Sur: She was called 
away to Los Angeles and my stom
ach aches for her. I must be drunk 
tonight. Soon she will return with 
her enormous feline earth-mother 
gazongas, and I will be at rest.
4/16/66, Rome: Zeffirelli is 
impossible and so is she! She flung 
a chocolate eclair in my face, 
gathered up her high heels (that 
sweet ocean of her foot smell, acres 
and acres of her! her! her!), and 
left in an Alfa Romeo. His name is 
Fabiano and I want to keel him, 
or keel her, or keel myself, but 
Zeffirelli wont have it. We MUST 
finish the picture now. Sometimes 
I think I was meant to live in 
another time and place, like 
eighth-century Moravia, where 
the women resembled market 
swine.
4/19/66, Rome: She was back 
today, crying, ripping her bodice 
for me! Our love was hot and
smelly. She made a sound like a 
walrus. I am very happy.
2/4/68, Puerto Vallarta: I have 
lost her now, Im sure of it. She 
thinks of nothing but jalapeno 
peppers. Today I sent Pedro to 
the market to bring back four 
gallons, but they were all gone 
from the villa by siesta. She drinks

it hard.
3/5/68, St Moritz: We made love 
for 38 hours last night. She is like 
Cutty Sark in a double-D-cup

3/8/68, St. Moritz: The sun 
shimmered against the mountain 
today and I loved her again and 
we both fell in the snow and 
started screaming like falcons 
that have been pierced by the

the end is near. I feel it when she 
leans close to me and whispers 
You are a drunken jerk. It is our

When Motorhead appeared 
in 1975, they were the worst 
band in the world. It 
took five years to get 
their first album, On 
Parole, released.
Since then, the band 
has been a whirl 
around frontman 
Lemmy, but their 
sound hasnt changed 
in their thirteen 
years. Theyve influenced the 
sound of heavy metal, and, in 
this age of Bon Jovi, the sound 
of Top Forty, more than any 
other band youve never heard
of.

The Wannsee Conference
Okay, this German flick is under the Showcase 
Collection heading. For all of you non-history type 
 of people, the Wannsee Conference was the secret 
meeting of the SS and Nazi Party where the fate of 
six million Jews was decided. The film is a drama
tization of the how they reached their Final Solu
tion, the complete annihilation of European Jews.
1 They tell us its outstanding. But, watch out guys,

Putting their lives on the walls
By JULIETTE BORDA
Special to The Tartan
An autobiography, as any CMer 
knows, informs a reader of the 
events of anothers life, from a 
first-hand point of view. A writer 
is frequently made uneasy while 
considering which personal de
tails of her life should or shouldnt 
be included in her text. Gener
ally, autobiographical 
chronicles tend to exceed 
two hundred pages, and 
can be conveniently 
stored on a shelf for later 
reference.
Similarly, an autobio
graphical work of art 
serves a similar function, 
and requires similar 
courage and inhibition, 
yet its storage is on a wall, for 
anyone passing by to see. Paint
ings, unlike printed texts, con
front an individual, without giv
ing him the choice to remove it 
from a bookshelf to look up infor
mation. At the Forbes Gallery this 
week, Leslie Michelle Watanabe, 
Holly Halliday, and Laurie Trate 
will show paintings and draw
ings that differ in subject matter 
and style, but all refer to each 
artists own life.
Scenes From Nightmares
Hollys paintings depict per
sonal events, hopes, and fears. 
One painting shows a man, a 
woman, and a boy with their heads 
down, standing in a forest. The
painting refers to the death of 
Holly brother-in-law. The stance 
of each individual in the painting 
is unsure, uncomfortable; it gives 
the viewer the same feeling of 
unrest. Holly will also show a 
series of drawings, her Dream 
Series. Most of the drawings 
depict scenes from nightmares, 
and the drawn imagery is about
as peculiar and as colorful and 
eerie as your last bizarre dream. 
One straightforward, powerful 
image is of the frowning, crossarmed and bony-knuckled artist, 
standing in an agitated field of 
charcoal marks. Its limited color 
and subject matter make the scene 
very clearly nightmarish.
Michelles paintings are mostly 
abstract, with punctual references 
to animals, a means 
through which others can 
come to understand the 
world around them, she 
says. Michelle encourages 
questioning the way the 
universe is believed to be 
evenly balanced; perhaps 
just one death, she says, 
could alter the organiza
tion. She doesnt particu
larly enjoy Political Art that sim
ply makes a statement; she says 
that she could design posters that 
serve that function. Her art does 
have a strong aesthetic, and the 
abstraction leads the viewer to 
believe that there is something 
behind the enigmatic shapes  
perhaps something about the 
artist herself. Formally, her paint
ings question the organization of 
the universe through their com
plex compositions and assorted 
fascinating textures. Most have 
curved yet determined shapes, 
and an asymmetry that invites a 
viewer. Michelle uses a varied 
palette, with colors such as vi
brant ultramarines, deep ochres, 
and unexpected pinks and reds.
Strong color also characterizes 
Laurie Trates illustrations, but 
in her case, color is used realisti
cally. She has an eye, as well as a 
hand, for detail, and enjoys the 
meticulous act of drawing realis
tically. Lauries work includes 
graphite drawings of animals, as 
well as thoughts from childhood 
and things that are close to her. 
She will also show black and white 
lithographs, a form of print that 
has the illusion of being drawn 
directly on the paper, rather than 
of having been printed.
Although the show starts to
day, the artists will have a closing 
reception on Saturday night, from 
7-9 pm at The Forbes Gallery, 
5200 Forbes Ave. The public (that 
includes you) is welcome to at
tend.

Bach at Synod Hall
By MICHAEL SCHWARTZ
Tartan Staffwriter
The Renaissance and Baroque Society will feature The Back 
Ensemble in Concertos of the Baroque, the third in the series 
of 1988-89 concerts. The concert will be performed this Satur

St. Pauls Cathedral at 125 North Craig Street.
' The concert will feature Bachs two Concertos in C minor for

violin, strings and continuo in D major by Antonio Vivaldi. The 
instruments featured in the concert include two harpsichords 
and three baroque violins, viola, cello and oboe.
The Bach Ensemble was founded by director Joshua Rifkin in 
1978. Since that time, the Ensemble has performed and recorded
large number of Bachs works, including the oboe concerts, the 
Mass in B minor and the Magnicicat and several cantatas as 
well. This season they will perform at several European festi
vals, including Regensburg, London and the Berliner Bachtage. They will also appear on Lincoln Centers Great Perform
ers Series. They are the first American group of this sort to hold 
such an honor.
The Ensemble features Stephen Hammer, recognized as 
Americas most-in-demand baroque oboist. Hammer has per

and the Academy of Ancient Music as well as recording with the 
Metropolitan Opera. Also, he has performed as the principal 
oboist with Concert Royal, the Smithsonian Chamber Orches
tra, the Boston Early music Festival Orchestra, and the Boston 
Handel and Haydn Society Orchestra.
Other members of the Ensemble include harpsichordist Ed 
Brewer and violinist Stanley Ritchie. Brewer is a harpsichordist 
with the Mostly Mozart Festival, the New York Chamber Solo4sts and the Orpheus Chamber Orchestra. Ritchie, the concert 
master of the Mostly Mozart Festival Orchestra, is a founding 
member of the summer academy Aston Magna and former 
concertmaster of the New York City Opera. He is also on the 
faculty of the Early Music Institute of Indiana University. This 
will be his third appearance with the Renaissance and Baroque 
Society.
Joshua Rifkin is the Ensembles director, founder, and harp
sichord player. He has taught at Princeton, Brandeis, New York 
University, Rutgers and Yale. This year he will appear as a guest 
conductor of the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra and the San 
Francisco Symphony and in January will be conducting several 
concerts at the Victoria Summer Music Festival in Melbourne. 
He will be in Pittsburgh on November 11 to conduGt a University

Quiet Riot was breaking the Top

time. Remember, you read it here 
first.
(If you missed the show last 
night at City Limits, take heart - 
the new Motorhead album is 
called No Sleep At All, in defer
ence to their 1981 live LP No 
Sleep TilHammersmith, and, yes, 
its live too. It has a few older 
tunes on it like Overkill, but its 
mostly from the last two albums. 
Good stuff.)
Recommended Album Of The 
Week: No Remorse, by (who else) 
Motorhead. A greatest hits pack
age, the double album provides a 
fairly complete distillation of the 
bands history, and only misses a 
few tunes of lesser importance. If 
youve ever been curious about 
this band, this is the place to 
start. (Its also a great Christmas 
gift to anyone who thinks heavy 
metal begins and ends with Metallica or Megadeath.)
Upcoming show not-to-bemissed: Half Japanese, with Bone

so check it out, but go vote first.

Id like salami and American cheese on wheat. And

Even though she hears the same thing over and 
iver, day in and day out, Helen Andrews loves her job. 
Jhe works the weekday lunch shift behind one of the 
andwich counters in Kiltie Cafe, and the repetition 
loesnt bother her.
Its a lot of work, but I wouldnt change for any;hing, she says. I love the kids.
Dressed in typical Dining Service attire  a red 
MDS shirt, disposable plastic gloves, and a nam;tag that reads Helen  Andrews is known for her 
mile, generous sandwiches, and interest in stulents. She works in the service line on the left as you 
ro down Kilties stairs.
Andrews will be a two-year Dining Service veteran 
next month. Prior to working at Kiltie, she was 
employed in the downtown cafeteria of Pittsburgh 
National Bank for seven years.
She claims theres a world of difference between the 
jxecutive and the college cafeteria. With bank people, 
you have to be really careful how you talk, she states. 
I cant explain. In the bank, they never say thank 
you. 
A widower for several years, Andrews lives in 
Homestead. She has two daughters, ages 31 and 25, 
who are employed as a school teacher and a secretary, 
respectively. She rides the bus to campus for her 
10:00-2:00 shift every weekday.
Andrews believes that seeing the same familiar 
people in the cafeteria can make a real difference to 
itudents. The kids here are far away from home. 
They need some faces they see every day, says 
Andrews. They have us.
Im concerned about their school, about their health, 
[f you treat the kids beautifully, they feel good.
It makes me feel good. I dont pretend.
Students are beautiful people.

A childhood game becomes real-life...
Coming full circle to Mister Rogers
By SUZY DOTTOR
Tartan Staffwriter
I loved to play about being on 
television, the bright-eyed Asso
ciate Producer of Mister Rogers' 
Neighborhood told me. In the 
house that I grew up in there was 
a closet door with a mirror at the 
bottom of one of the stairways. 
When I was ten years old or so, 
and I would sit on the steps irt 
front of the mirror, playing about 
having my own television show, 
and the mirror was the screen. I 
called that the Happy Hedda 
Show, she chuckles. Now Hedda 
Sharapan is indeed happy in a job 
she finds wonderfully satisfying. 
I love to tell people that story 
now because you never know 
exactly where the seeds of 
childrens play will lead them. 
Sharapan believes that all our 
lives we rework what was impor
tant to us as children. This is true 
of Sharapans life; in fact, you 
might say that her life has come 
full circle.
Besides pretending to be on 
television there were two other 
photo courtesy Family Communications, Inc. things that Sharapan loved to do 
1965 CMU Alum Hedda Sharapan is the Associate Producer of Mister as a child. She loved playing with 
Rogers Neighborhood. Her job involves representing Mr. Rogers around children. I was always attracted
the world.
to the babies and children in the 
neighborhood. Id wake up in the 
morning and hope that the little 
boy across the street was in his 
play pen so I could go over and 
play with him.
Her third love was reading and 
from that stemmed a love of learn
ing. In school she was a good 
student with a sharp memory, 
which was one reason she pur
sued a career as a doctor when 
she entered college. My parents 
had always given me the sense 
that I could do something impor
tant with my life that would help 
other people.
And so, Sharapans decision as 
to where to go to college fell easily 
into place. I wanted a small school 
where I could get a strong back
ground in science and I knew that 
Carnegie Mellon (then Carnegie 
Tech) was a good school with a 
fine reputation.
Sharapan started as a biology 
major but found that she had little 
affinity for the lab work. She 
doesnt regret the experience, 
though. I learned through that 
that I am a people-person. In her 
junior year, she got a job in the 
Psychology department where she 
found that she loved the people as
well as the department. Psychol
ogy became her new major.
After graduating in 1965 from 
Carnegie Tech, Sharapan didnt 
know exactly what to do with her 
major so she knocked on doors 
throughout Pittsburgh. One place 
she happened to come by was 
WQED. Since she was interested 
in childrens television the sta
tion referred her to Fred Rogers. 
This was before Mister Rogers 
Neighborhood had begun, but 
Sharapan recognized his name 
anyway. I knew of Fred Rogers 
because I loved the program that 
he and Josie Carey made in the 
fifties that I grew up with, 
Childrens Corner.
Rogers suggested that Shara
pan consider a masters degree in 
Child Development. He felt that 
the University of Pittsburgh 
would be a good place to study; he 
himself had studied there and 
knew that as a student Sharapan 
would have a lot of time to spend 
with children in natural settings. 
She took his advice.
In October of 1966 Sharapan 
was in her second year of gradu
ate school when she was asked to 
be the Assistant Director of Mis
ter Rogers Neighborhood. The
position involved no child devel
opment; it called for holding a 
stop watch and there was no pay! 
But her love for children and the 
desire to help others would not let 
her say no. She was the Assistant 
Director for the shows first sea
son, in which 65 episodes were 
made.
Sharapan was asked to be the 
Assistant Producer for the shows 
second season as well. However, 
now an expectant mother, Shara
pan declined. I lost the baby in 
the seventh month. My first reac
tion when I came out of the anes
thetic was, maybe I can still get 
that job.
She soon found out that they 
had combined the jobs of Assis
tant Director and Producer and 
had given the job to someone else. 
But she persevered. Even though 
we were moving into a new home 
and I had all the grieving to deal 
with I signed up to teach a course 
in child development at Commu
nity College. Then one day she 
received a phone call asking her 
to return to Mister RogersNeigh
borhood. Combining the jobs had 
meant too much responsibility for 
one person so Sharapan became

Carnegie Mellon Dining Service hopes to attract responsible students for management
Were looking for a way to tap class
room interest and apply it to our op
eration. 
CMDS Director James Gurley
By NATALIE CAPONE
Tartan Staffwriter
In light of negative publicity 
about long lines and unpleasant 
serving attendants at the Tartan 
Grill and a 64 percent decrease in 
the number of student employees 
over three years, Director of Car
negie Mellon Dining Services 
James Gurley, is kicking off a 
campaign that he hopes will en
courage students to take advan
tage of the supervisory opportu
nities and chances to apply class
room experience to operations 
that CMDS offers.
Theres more to Carnegie Mel
lon Dining Service than just serv
ing peas in Kiltie, said Gurley. 
We need to promote the value of 
student employment. CMDS is 
competitive monetarily, offering 
raises of up to fifty cents per hour 
to returning student employees 
in the fall semester and employ
ing both work study and non-work 
study students, but were suffer
ing from a lack of self-esteem. 
Sure, working for dining service 
is not glamorous, but we need to 
emphasize that management 
opportunities and special project 
work for our student employees
exists, said Gurley.
For example, CMDS has em
ployed student computer pro
grammers to keep track of per
sonnel and accounting systems, 
art and design students to pro
mote and advertise special pro
grams, and business students to 
develop marketing programs, 
surveys of consumer opinion, and 
ways to improve operations. 
Were looking for a way to tap 
classroom interest and apply it to 
our operation, said Gurley. As 
Dining Services Human Re
sources Manager, Rochelle Koch 
will attempt to match employee
interest with job need.
Presently, CMDS has five stu
dent managers who have worked 
their way to their current posi
tions. After investing a semester 
of hands-on work in our operation
 learning the serving line, dish 
room, or cash register  we look
for supervisory potential in those 
who are industrious, said Gurley. 
This experience is invaluable as 
future employment credentials, 
not just in food cookery, but in 
interpersonal relations, manage
ment, and handling customers. 
Cameron Long, a sophomore
Electrical and Computer Engi
neering major and student man
ager at MorePizza, is not so sure 
about the future employment 
benefits of his position, but it 
eases my financial burden. Its 
good from the point that most 
students are likely to someday be 
managers, but I dont like all of 
the stress and bullshit of Marri
ott Corporations structure, he 
said, referring to what he per
ceives as the strict structure which 
oversees CMDS. As a student 
manager, I dont have the ability 
to change anything. Marriott

KGB: Organizing geeks at CMU
By KHRISTINA MAYES
Tartan Staffwriter
When I was put on the KGB
- story, I had no idea what the KGB 
was; I had some vague notion of a 
_communist organization on CMU 
campus, but that was the extent 
of my knowledge.
v I made an appointment to in- terview KGB President Jon Ben. nett. He was kind enough to bring 
-along several KGB members to 
^add to the general fun. After explaining that I really had no idea 
what the KGB was all about, I 
was informed that it was an or
ganization of geeks devoted to 
being really strange. Further
more, it was explained to me that 
a geek is not a Dweeb; a geek is 
an intelligent hacker.
Determined to get to the heart 
of the story, I asked about the 
^social life of KGB members. I 
received laughter.
; Well, I think KGB is really 
..nifty ... good. Its improved, if not 
altogether given me, my social 
life, sophomore Matt McKissock 
(who goes by the moniker Wil
liam F. Buckley Jr.) stated in 
. overview of the groups social life.
! I thought that computer and 
I math geeks were supposed to be 
I -super-intelligent, but when I 
! -voiced this, I received another 
* great round of laughter. It seems 
t that unless some great miracle 
j occurs, Bennett will be on acai demic probation next semester. It 
I was somewhat reassuring to know 
I jthat the vice-president has a 4.0 
i . QPA, and the Minister of Death 
t is near 4.0, whoever he is.
Not everyone in KGB is a loser 
^geek type, claims McKissock. 
'This became increasingly evident 
vas the interview progressed. In 
fact, KGB members seemed like a 
pretty fun group of people, 
even though some of their 
- favorite group activities 
f    involve killer (which fol
lows along the lines of the 
''movie Gotcha) and den^tal floss. I didnt inquire 
'^'further into that topic.
I learned that KGB is a 
new organization which 
"-was formed just last year.
j " Its membership has _______
grown to 47 members;
""only six of them are female. It is 
,}ri 'composed mostly of freshmen and 
sophomores who are dedicated 
to having a good time. Although 
 it is mostly comprised of comj'- puter, science, and engineering 
students, there are a few CFA

was interviewing urged me to 
come to their meeting, and curi
ous, I agreed.
At the meeting, one of the mem
bers began 
explaining 
the pos
sible es
cape routes 
should 
things get 
out of 
hand. As 
my eyes 
widened, 
he assures 
me that people didnt need medi
cal attention after the meetings. 
Usually. Just stay clear of the 
treasurer, I was warned. I began 
to have serious doubts about the 
adventure.
Architecture students were in 
the lecture hall that KGB usually 
occupies, and the way things were 
developing, it looked like there 
would be a riot before the night 
was over. Bennett spoke with the 
angry professors for a few min
utes and then led everyone to 
another lecture hall downstairs 
in Margaret Morrison. He pointed 
out to us that since we had no 
architects in the group, we 
couldnt storm the room, and 
after explaining the scheduling 
mix-up, he told us that he couldnt 
very well call campus police to 
throw the architects out of their 
own building!
The proceedings were formal  
as formal as possible for the KGB, 
anyhow. After lollipops were 
thrown at everyone in celebra
tion of Halloween, the entertain
ment committee did a demonstra
tion of two free electrons. The 
official transcriptor read the pro
ceedings of the last meeting. Then 
Susan Olson, the head of the rituAfter lollipops were thrown

Halloween, the entertainment 
committee did a demonstra

als committee, did a chemistry 
experiment involving blue chemi
cals that glowed in the dark. She 
went on to give the results of her 
fact-finding assignment concern
ing the KGBs movie situation. It 
seems that like other campus 
organizations, the KGB cannot 
show movies in any building other 
than a persons room without a 
movie license, which costs about 
$1500.
This movie issue was discussed 
at length, and someone made the 
motion that KGB secede from the 
Union, thereby making it possible
-------------------------------------- for them
to show 
movies. 
Someone 
else sec
onded it, 
and as 
the calls 
went up 
for Aye
mmtrtrvrrti i iih w innnpj~ Nay. 
Bennettcalled for a reality check. (It 
appears that he has to do this 
rather frequently during the 
meetings.)
Then it was time for the 
treasurers report, and everyone 
got their change ready. Knowing 
that I had come unprepared for 
this, McKissock handed me some 
pennies, and everyone then stoned 
the treasurer with change. He 
ran around scooping it off the floor 
and counting it. In the end, he 
gave a rough estimate of the 
organizations current treasury 
holdings. Bennett was seen slip
ping a few pennies into his own 
pocket at this time.
The proceedings then went into 
new business. The fifteen-to-sixteen foot poster was discussed 
briefly; it will be making an ap
pearance on campus shortly. 
There is still hope that KGB may 
have a booth for carnival this year. 
A 3-man volleyball team was or
ganized, and talks of buggy went 
on. Bennett formally announced 
that KGB urges you to exercise 
your right to vote on Tuesday.
Then it was time to embarrass 
the Tartan Staffwriter. After tak
ing a collection of the money (A 
dollar, a quarter. Come on, you 
_____________ can spare a quar
ter!), my member
ship fee was paid by 
the members, and 
once I filled out and 
signed the sheet, I 
was made an official 
KGB member.
From then on, all 
havoc broke loose. 
People were run_____________ ning around, a tennis ball was being 
bounced off a wall, and no one 
could hear a thing. Somebody 
shouted the motion to adjourn 
the meeting, and it was seconded.
After an entire hour of such 
craziness, I made my escape, in 
one piece, but as the sixth female 
member of KGB.
KGB is a Senate-recognized so
cial organizatrion. The name was 
chosen to counter Carnegie In
volvement Association (CIA).

Making a dormitory feel like home
Have you noticed that the 
world seems to sense that win
ter is on the way? Soup com
mercials tempt you with homey 
scenes of families reuniting over 
bowls of broth. Christmas deco
rations that do everything but 
tap-dance are appearing in
Hallmark stores. The weather 
is getting colder, and we all want 
to go home to Mom. We cant, so 
we sublimate that wish into one 
for Mom-type food  chicken 
soup, fresh-baked bread, popovers, cookies....
The nice thing about Momtype food is that its relatively 
easy to recreate in non-Momtype surroundings. Take bread, 
for example. Its not an instantly 
cooked food, but it takes your
mind off of your studies for about 
an hour and takes care of itself for 
the rest of the time (except for 
actually baking it). This recipe 
isnt your usual quick easy recipe, 
but its cheap and its so neat I felt 
I should pass it on.
Mom-type Bread
This recipe has to rise for a long 
time, but thats okay because you 
set it to a relatively easy time
table. Start in the evening; use it 
as a study break for when you 
cant stand to look at another 
differential equation. It shouldnt 
take much more than an hour.
You need: 6 cups of flour, 1 
packet dry yeast (they come in 
sheets of three packets), 1 table
spoon sugar, 1 tablespoon butter, 
1 and 1/2 tablespoons salt, 2 cups 
water, and 2 loaf pans (Bakers 
Secret makes nice non-stick ones. 
You can get them in most kitchen 
supply stores, or in the East Lib
erty Giant Eagle and the Food 
Gallery).
Boil more than a cup of water, 
and measure one cup of that (if 
you start with a cup, youll lose
about a fourth of it to steam) 
into a large bowl. Dissolve your 
sugar, butter, and salt in that 
Set it aside.
Take a cup of lukewarm water 
(tap wateris okay). Lukewarm* 
means that it feels warm to yoUr 
fingertip but not to your wrist. 
Dissolve the packetful of yeast 
into the water. Stir gently to get 
rid of any lumps. Set it aside 
and stir the mixture in the bow] 
to cool it. When that mixture is 
lukewarm (use the finger-wrist 
test, even though it will get your 
fingers a little greasy), add the 
dissolved yeast. Stir until 
smooth.
Add flour, about a cupful ata 
time, stirring until completely 
dissolved. You will be able to 
easily stir it until youhave added 
your fourth cupful. When it gets 
too thick to stir easily, turn the 
dough out onto a clean, floured 
board or counter top and knead 
the rest of the flour into the 
dough, half a cupful at a time, 
How do you knead dough? Dust 
your hands with flour (so they 
wont be too sticky). Put a little

The Dark 
Iron City
This is a very special install
ment of A Momentary Lapse Of 
Javi because I have been given 
permission to present an excerpt 
from my forthcoming detective 
novel. So, without further ado, 
here it is....
The Big Burg
Chapter One: Carnegie Mellon 
Never Forgets
It was a hot night in the city of 
Pittsburgh. Thats right, PittsMomentary
Lapse
of
Javi
Javier
Grillo-Marxuach
burgh, Steeltown, The Sweaty 
Arm-Pitt, the Big Burg, Three 
Rivers Town, The Iron City. A 
hard rain fell over the livable city 
on this sultry evening, but, as I 
would soon find out, not a rain 
hard enough to wipe the slime 
from the gutters of the town by 
the Monongahela.
My name is Phillip Hammer, 
my occupation, Private Dick. 
Thats right, Private Dick. For 
those of you who werent teethed 
on Mickey Spillane, a Private Dick 
is a detective, a gumshoe, a Pri
vate Eye.
The heat was oppressive; the 
kind of heat which makes you 
sweat buckshot and pant like a 
mallard in heat during the middle 
of hunting season. It had been a 
slow night. Although I had been 
working out of my conveniently

History Professor Stearns discusses sexuality in Skibo
By KATHY MASSUCCI
Tartan Staffwriter
Where is the sexual revolu
tion now? This was the question 
Peter Stearns used to kick off 
the Universitys series on sex in 
the Skibo ballroom last Mon
day.
Professor Stearns, the head 
of the History Department, 
teaches two courses: Intro to 
World History and Sex and 
Death, a first-half mini course. 
Stearns feels that the mini 
course is probably what inspired 
the University to choose him to 
introduce the sex series: As 
many of you know, I have virtu
ally no expert claims in this 
area whatsoever. So in terms of 
the overall series, you should 
regard this session as foreplay.
Sex and Death is a popular 
course at Carnegie Mellon, due, 
perhaps, to the fact that it is one 
of the few if not the only course 
on sexuality offered. The course 
is an opportunity for students 
to think about sexual issues in 
a non-threatening fashion, be
cause nobodys talking about 
[the students] sexuality. 
Stearns hopes that, for this, 
reason, the other lectures in the 
series will be better attended by 
students. However, the ball
room was sparsely populated 
for his Sex in Perspective talk.
I was less disappointed in 
the turnout than the fact that 
there werent a heck of a lot of 
undergraduates there. After all,
thats the target audience. Even 
though the lecture series should 
be considered a purely objective 
look at sexuality today, Stearns 
feels that one problem with a 
lecture series of this sort is that 
the kinds of students who might 
most benefit from an opportu
nity to discuss sexual issues are, 
by that same token, unlikely to 
show up. That is, they either 
think they know it all already, 
and theyre great stud heroes, 
or theyre, and I think this is 
more common, terribly embar
rassed and terribly reluctant to 
display any ignorance.
Those members of society who 
arent aware of whats going on 
with sexuality were one focus of 
Steams lecture. More of us are 
ignorant about sexuality than 
should be, and not just from the 
standpoint of avoiding unwanted 
pregnancies or diseases.
Why is that? Perhaps this lack 
of sexual awareness is due to 
What Stearns calls a lingering 
Victorian morality. Even now, in 
the late 1980s, many people still 
have a Victorian impulse toward 
sexguilty feelings encouraging 
sexual restraint. Children are 
taught to attach feelings of shame 
and fear to sex: Americans are 
still trained as kids to think that 
their sexual apparatus is dirty 
and they arent supposed to play 
with it and then theyre expected 
to grow up somehow managing to 
become healthy self-expressive 
sexual adults. Anxieties and guilt 
in children about sexual impulses

Sex at Eight month last Monday in the Ballroom.
becomes adult restraint.
In some cases, this adult re
straint involves an unwillingness 
to talk frankly to kids about their 
sexuality. In dealing with kids of important human activity has
probably reason
able. This was 
viewed as a posi
tive good, a libera
tion from the 
community re
straints that are 
the basis for Victorianism.
Sex then be
comes viewed as 
more important 
than it had been, 
is privileged over 
other bodily func
tions, and treated 
as a great big 
deal, and one of 
the fundamental 
expressions of 
human behavior. 
This can be attrib
uted to a new 
knowledge of sex 
as an important 
personal expres
sion and a way to 
demonstrate ma
turity, demonstrate what defines 
an adult society.
Over time, this tendency to 
.escalate sexuality as an extremely
high school age, this is a tragic 
mistake, as this is the age at which 
they are most likely to have their 
first sexual experience.
Along with the Victorian im
pulse, another thing that hap
pened with western society over 
the past, really now, two hundred 
years is a tendency to exaggerate 
and exalt sexuality beyond whats
increased. Most people, in this 
room, I would expect in trying to 
choose between the two patterns, 
will find the second pattern con
siderably more choosable than the 
first.
An interesting twist is how both 
sexes react to sex as a personal 
expression. Women are trained to 
associate sexuality with a par
ticularly deep emotional com
mitment. The female Ameri
can version of sexual expres
sion argues for a linkage of 
sexuality and what is conven
tionally called deep romantic 
love. The problem with this is 
that men dont agree. Eightyfive percent of all women view 
sexuality this way,... and some
thing under fifty percent of all 
men profess an interest in asso
ciating sexuality with a deep 
emotional commitment.
In the past thirty years or so, 
a particular sexual culture has 
been set up among many col
lege students. There is a huge 
difficulty, because of the impor
tance of sexual expression, for 
college age students to express 
particularly vigorous doubts or 
ingnorances about sexuality. 
Theres a tremendous pressure 
to pretend to be more knowl
edgeable than one is, to pretend 
to be more adept than one is, to 
pretend to score more often than 
one does. This attitude, too, is 
a constraint.
Its obvious that contempo
rary society goes crazy over sex. 
A particular bent towards he
donism exists as well as Victo
rian morality these days. This 
results in a certain imbalance. 
Most people have both strains 
in us, and we should recognize 
our conflicting impulses and try 
to use them productively to 
create a certain balance. One of 
the results of the hedonistic

Freedom is ... taking a day off from life
You wake up on a gorgeous spring morn
ing. The air smells of flowers. The birds, 
just back from Florida, cant stop singing. 
You know you ought to be outside, playing, 
but its a Tuesday, a workday. That spoils 
everything.
But wait. You turn up the radio. Could it 
be true? What luck! President Reagan has 
announced that today is Celebration Day, 
the nations only spontaneous, surprise 
holiday. All of America has the day off! A 
beautiful day is forecast around the coun
try, the president says, so go outside and 
enjoy yourselves!
For Thaddeus Seymour, such a holiday 
is the stuff of dreams.
He is president of Rollins College in 
Winter Park, Florida. And if he had his 
way, a surprise day of freedom would com
plement calendar holidays like Memorial 
Day and Labor Day. Scheduling a holiday 
takes the fun out of it, he says.
Seymour knows that such a day off 
wouldnt make it through Congress. Big 
business would complain about lost pro
ductivity. Spoilsports would warn of a
Russian attack on the day off. But in his 
own way, he keeps the dream alive.
Once each spring, he surprises his cam
pus by announcing a day off: A time to 
celebrate nature and being human. 
Seymour first tried to organize such a 
holiday when he was dean of Dartmouth 
College in the late 1960s. The time wasnt 
right, he says. Students were serious 
about Vietnam. Imagine taking this kind 
of day off during Kent State. It seemed too 
frivolous.
But he was able to establish an unex
pected holiday when he was named presi
dent of Indianas Wabash College in 1972.
And when he came to Rollins in 1978, he 
learned that a similar school holiday, called 
Fox Day, had been discontinued a decade 
earlier. He reinstated it.
I take this personally, he says. Select
ing Fox Day is the one decision I make by 
myself. No committees. No faculty vote. 
He looks for good weather and a certain 
itchiness on campus. I hold my finger to 
the breeze. I know its right if Im ready for 
it. Ive got to feel it in my bones.
Fox Day is so named because at dawn on 
the actual day, Seymour places a statue of 
a fox on the library lawn. Then the first 
students to notice it wake up the campus.
The place explodes, Seymour says. 
Students come in their pajamas to look at 
the fox. Its amazing. Everyone wants to 
get up to know that they finally have a day 
they can sleep late.
Proclamations are posted, classes are 
cancelled, and Seymour hosts a picnic.
(In late winter, fraternities hold betting 
pools on the arrival of Fox Day. By spring, 
some students are playing Fox Day Rou
lette. Theyre so sure the fox will appear
the next day, they dont study for a sched
uled exam.)
The key is to make it a surprise, Sey
mour says. Once I even made it on April 
Fools Day. That confused 'em.
Seymour calls Fox Day a wonderful 
affirmation of the child in all of us. There 
is something familiar here: Remember 
when we were children and wed wake up 
after a snowstorm to learn school was 
canceled? Fox Day is like a snow day, 
says Seymour, only your parents arent 
telling you how to spend it.
Seymour has tried to spread the Fox 
Day spirit. Once he almost convinced the 
mayor of Crawfordsville, Ind., to organize 
a townwide day off. But the towns biggest 
employer, a printing plant, computed that 
the holiday would cost it $88,000. That 
ended that.
Arlo Guthrie used to say that if a few 
people sang Alices Restaurant to pro
test the draft, others would join in. If Fox 
Day could grow from town to town, pretty 
soon wed have a movement like Alices

Center helps to dispel myths about suicide
By DEBORAH J. SAX
Tartan Staffwriter
Teenage Suicide. Its a familiar 
phrase. We-hear it on the news, or 
on special television reports. It 
appears often in magazines ar
ticles, and is discussed by the 
Counseling and Student Devel
opment Center in the lounge of 
your dorm. Yet, despite all of the 
information, a great deal of mis
understanding still surrounds the 
subject of suicide. Often, it is a 
subject that most individuals are 
uncomfortable with, or would just 
rather not discuss.
Today, suicide is second only to 
accidents in claiming the lives of 
Americas youth. Studies also 
show that college students are 
the loneliest people in our society. 
Many are away from home; the 
support structure provided by the 
family is no longer a part of stu
dents daily lives. Little is known, 
however, about the exact statis| llcs on college suicides. Often, a 
; school will try to hide its suicides 
i for fear of bad publicity. But the 
| number of college suicides is 
| e*pected to be higher than that of 
, other youths that do not attend 
j college.
How common is suicide here at 
Carnegie Mellon? Popular opin
ion seems to indicate that the 
suicide rate at CMU is high. 
However, Dr. Lorrie Rabin, Di
rector of the Counseling and 
Student Development Center 
states that this belief is nothing 
more than a myth. She reports 
that, on the average, four or five 
suicide attempts occur per year 
at CMU, a figure lower than that 
for most high-pressure universi
ties.
Early symptoms of a potential 
suicide include: speaking of sui
cide or of harming oneself, moodi
ness, changes in social behavior, 
repeated mention of a specific 
date, frequent crying spells, in
creases in the use of alcohol or 
other drugs, or general changes 
in lifestyle.
Some of the common myths 
about suicide:
People who talk about suicide 
never follow through. Approxi
mately 80 percent of all suicidal 
persons give friends and family 
clear clues about their intentions 
to kill themselves. Some psycholo
gists feel that the single most 
important sign of a potential sui
cide is if the person mentions 
suicide or mentions planning to 
hurt himself in some way. Thus, 
suicidal persons often speak of
hurting themselves with the hope 
that someone will hear their cry 
and help alleviate their pain.
Talking about suicide encour
ages it. When people with suici
dal tendencies learn to voice their 
feelings, it often serves to greatly 
relieve their feelings of hopeless
ness and despair. However, if 
individuals are denied the oppor
tunity to talk about their feel
ings, their feelings become much 
more overwhelming. In some 
instances, copy-cat suicides have
occurred. However, this phenom
ena occurs typically when suicide 
has been romanticized rather 
than been discussed factually.
Nothing can be done about the 
suicide rate. Studies have shown 
that in areas of increased aware
ness, suicide rates have gone 
down. The information gathered 
when we study suicides can be 
successfully applied to suicide 
prevention.
Once a person is suicidal, they 
are beyond help. Those who have
faith in this myth view the term 
suicidal as a permanent label, 
given to a person for life. Rabin 
wants to place particular empha
size on that fact that being suici
dal is a temporary condition. A 
person with suicidal thoughts 
needs not to be hospitalized for 
life: rather, he needs only help to 
see him though his temporary 
crisis and after the crisis until the 
problems which brought on the 
suicidal thoughts have been suf
ficiently resolved.
The causes of suicide are both 
simple and complex. The main 
causes of suicide and suicide at
tempts at this university and 
nationwide include family prob
lems, depression, and academic 
pressures. Typically, a number of 
these sources of stress build up on 
an individual, and serve to com
pound his anxiety. Typically is 
actually an inaccurate word be
cause suicide atttempts are by 
their nature highly individual

Therapy is a profoundly hu
man caring and mutual, trusting 
relationship between two people. 
One is suffering, and the other 
has the training, skill, and moti
vation to alleviate that suffering 
through on-going interaction. 
That's how Dr. Lorrie Rabin, di
rector of the Counseling and 
Student Development Center 
(CSDC) defines therapy.
Quite different from the per
ception that it is something one 
passively receives in hope of some 
miracle cure, therapy is a rela
tionship that two people share
About 500 students a year visit 
the CSDC in search of therapy. 
The center boasts 9 trained per
manent staff, and other profes
sionals are called in as needed. 
Counselors provide students in 
need with up to 12 weekly ses
sions of individual therapy.
Although therapy is the primary 
function of CSDC, it only a part of 
the services offered. In addition 
to the counseling by appointment, 
the center provides a crisis serv
ice as well. If you are ever in a 
crisis situation, you can stop by at 
CSDC without an appointment 
and a professional is prepared to 
listen to your problems and help 
you, or direct you to other profes
sionals who can. After hours, you 
can reach a counselor by dialing 
the centers number. An answer
ing service will give you the 
number of the counselor on call.
Another service offered by 
CSDC is a free consulting service. 
If you have a friend who you are 
concerned about, or need some 
advise, you can call CSDC. Sur
prisingly,. Rabin says that may 
professors take advantage of this 
service when they become con
cerned about a students absence 
or changes in behavior.
The counselors also coordinate 
a program for RAs, and the center 
is responsible for the tutoring 
service advertised weekly. In
addition, the CSDC offers a vari
ety of other programs throughout 
the semester. These programs are 
open forum discussions that cqver 
topics such as relationships, stress 
management, and depression'.
If you find yourself with prob
lems you feel are to big for you to 
handle, you should consider 
scheduling a session with the 
counselors at CSDC. Attending a 
high-pressure university Can 
make all of us feel lonely or de
pressed. At CSDC, professiorials 
are prepared to help you to clearly 
view your options, and to discover 
yourself more about yourself and 
your alternatives through your 
relationship with your counselor.

Its really an interesting job, 
especially trying to keep abreast 
of all the new federal regulations. 
They are constantly changing, and 
we must have all our systems in

As director, Anderson oversees 
the entire office. However, she 
still sees individual students just

Chabad House opens for CMU students
By DAVID GANTSHAR
Tartan Staffwriter
Rabbi Shmuel and Sara Wein
stein run Chabad House, the 
new Jewish student organiza
tion on campus, from their home 
on Wallingford Street in 
Shadyside. Theyll tell you, Its 
your home too. Anytime.
What exactly is Chabad 
House? It is a place for Jewish 
students to get together and 
enjoy events geared toward 
Jewish topics, the Rabbi said.
Chabad House is not inter
ested in stressing certain be
liefs. The Weinsteins want to 
serve as a bridge between Jew
ish students both culturally and 
socially while stressing unity.
Judaism is not only a religion, but 
also a culture, a heritage, and a 
way of life.
The Weinsteins have been ac
tive in Jewish activities since 
Shmuel served as President of 
Hillel at Virginia Tech, and Sara 
served on the Executive Board of 
Hillel at the University of North 
Carolina at Chapel Hill. Last year 
they ran the Chabad House at the 
University of Delaware.
Sara remembers her own con
cern over joining a Jewish group 
when she was in college. What if 
I didnt fit in? she asked herself. 
I dont want people to feel that 
way here. Everyone is welcome.
In the upcoming months Ch
abad House has several activities 
planned.
Beginning Friday, November 11 
and continuing until November 
13, will be the first of many Shabbatons. In addition to a five course 
dinner and a service in their home, 
the Weinsteins will be having 
activities all day Saturday. For 
example, there will be classes 
ranging from issues such as the 
Torah portion of the week to the 
philosophy of Judaism. Guest 
speaker Ruth Shatkin, a singer/ 
composer from New York City, 
will be coming to talk. In addi
tion, Saturday night will feature 
an Israeli coffeehouse with many 
different local musicians perform
ing live.
Currently, Chabad House is 
running two classes.
One is a Basic Judaism semi
nar, Tuesday evenings at 8 pm 
in Skibo Room 112. Topics in 
this class include The Meaning 
of Judaism, and a game called 
Stump the Rabbi.
The .second class is a conver
sational Hebrew class, Tuesday 
nights at 9 pm, taught over pizza 
at Yacovs in Squirrel Hill.
Several events coming up in
clude Shabbat luncheons with 
college professors and commu
nity leaders as well as several 
social action programs. One of - 
these programs will feature a 
talk by a Russian Refusnik on 
the problems Jewish citizens in 
the Soviet Union face today.
Chabad House welcomes stu
dents for a free Shabbat meal 
and during holidays.

Linda Anderson is CMUs new Director 
of Financial Aid.
one with any questions about 
financial aid, in specific or gen
eral, should make an appointment 
and any of us will be glad to talk. 
The office is creating a newsletter 
to be distributed to students and 
departments that should help 
meet some of these needs.
Anderson claims she doesnt do 
too much outside of Carnegie

takes up most of my free time, if 
thats what you call it, and just 
makes coming home so enjoyable! 
Im sorry that I cant give you 
exciting sports or adventures, but 
shes our whole life right now. 
Anderson received her under
graduate degree in Spanish Sec
ondary Education from Indiana 
University of Pennsylvania in 
1974. She earned her masters 
degree in Student Personnel Serv
ices in 1975 and began working in 
the financial aid office of the Com
munity College of Allegheny 
County. She moved to Robert 
Morris College and assumed the 
position of Director of Financial 
Aid.
After working at Robert Morris 
for a year and a half, Anderson 
came to Carnegie Mellon in 1979. 
She is the Pennsylvania state rep

flour onto your dough and fold the 
dough in half. Punch it down and 
knead so that you cant find the 
seam of the fold. Put a little flour 
on that and fold it in half, punch 
it down. Put some on the work 
surface. Then scrunch the dough 
(on top of the flour) into a ball. Get 
part of the balls surface covered 
with flour; fold the ball so the 
floured surface is inside; repeat. 
Its a great activity for working 
out your tensions. Take THAT,

Keep going until either youve 
used six cups of flour or until the 
dough wont take anymore (i.e.
its too dry and flour wont absorb 
into it). Now comes the easy part. 
Put it into a large pot or bowl 
(about the size of a wok), lightly 
rub butter on to the top of it, and 
cover with a clean cloth. Put it 
into a warm place (on a table by a 
radiator, on top of the refrigera
tor, inside the oven if the ovens 
not on) and leave it there over
night. Clean up your kitchen and 
go back to studying.
Before you leave for class the 
next morning, take the dough out 
and divide it into two equal parts 
either by pulling it apart or cut
ting it down the middle with a 
sharp knife. Shape each into a
loaf-like shape and set them each 
into lightly greased loaf pans (if 
you get a non-stick like Bakers 
Secret you dont have to grease 
them). Setthem back in the warm 
place and go to class. When you 
come home for dinner, they should 
have doubled in size. Preheat the 
oven to 400 degrees (if you kept 
them inside the oven, take them 
out first!). Bake for 20-30 min
utes or until the top is lightly 
browned and the sides have pulled 
away from the sides of the pan. 
Pull them out of the pans. If you 
dont want a very tough crust, let 
them cool wrapped in clean cloths 
like dish towels. Or, you can just

store and ask what it is about our 
fish that makes them swim so 
fast.
As it turns out, some fish just 
swim fast but changing the posi, tion of the tank makes fish swim 
I faster too. And that makes sense 
1 since because we are in produc' tion only three times a year. We 
' move the tank a lot.
; Helping Mister Rogers answer 
; his fan mail is not always this 
; easy. He receives fifteen to thirty 
! letters a day from diverse people: 
! an eighteen year old heart trans! plant patient who found courage 
through watching Mister Rogers; 
an elderly woman who appreci
ates the positive attitude inher; ent in the show; and a little girl 
; who wants to teach the baby platy
pus puppet how to color. These 
; are just a few examples. As a 
nationally-known caring adult, 
Mister Rogers words and advice 
; are taken seriously. Assisting in 
; the preparation of his responses 
; therefore is a great responsibil
ity. Anything we do is an exten
sion ofthe television show. Yet we 
cant see the other side. We dont 
know the people personally and 
so we must be aware of these 
boundaries.
The time she spent working 
from her home on the fan mail 
was a wonderful part of life for 
Sharapan. It allowed me to have 
what I need for my motherhood. I 
wanted to be there with my ba
bies. I loved that part of my life. 
Another part of Sharapans job 
developed because she was not 
tied to office hours. As Fred 
Rogers reputation was growing 
in the field of child development, 
people were continually asking 
for him to speak at conferences. 
His time and energy were so 
needed, and still are, for the pro
gram and related material that 
its just not possible for him to 
travel and make programs. Since 
I had a masters degree in child 
development, had been with Mis
ter Rogers Neighborhood since 
the beginning, and had the real 
life experience of being a mother, 
it was only natural for me to try to 
do this."
That part of her job has given
What more could I ask 
for than to be around 
people who care about 
children?"
her a professional identity and 
she is grateful to Fred Rogers for 
giving her the luxury of handling 
the job in a way that matches her 
motherhood. Even now, Im paid
by the hour for the time Im here 
in the office, because I want to be 
home at 3 oclock when my young
est daughter, Laurie, gets home 
from high school. Its just nice to 
be around her, especially since 
Im out of town so much on week
ends doing speeches.
Out of town is an understate
ment. Sharapan has been all over 
the world speaking on behalf of 
Mister Rogers. She speaks at 
preschool teacher conventions, to 
parenting groups and hospital 
staff. She has participated in the 
International Childrens Festival 
in Munich, has done consulting 
work in Cologne, Germany, and a 
week-long session of workshops 
in Fairbanks, Alaska.
Sharapans speeches are tai
lored to the group she is speaking 
to. Topics include communicat
ing with children and how to help 
parents and their children deal 
with television, death, and di
vorce. She gives the sense that 
Mister Rogers' Neighborhood is 
more that just a childrens televi
sion show. It provides real com
munication with families and 
children. Sharapan finds this part 
of her job challenging and very 
rewarding. Ive had some mar
velous traveling experiences and 
Ive always been around caring 
people. What more could I ask for 
than to be around people who 
care about children?
One special project was a poign
ant booklet Sharapan wrote en
titled Talking with Young Chil
dren About Death, which is now 
available at funeral homes across 
the country. It was written not 
long after the death of her own
father when her two daughters 
were four and seven. Sharapan 
does not pretend to know all the 
answers. In fact, she tells her 
readers, There are no easy an
swers especially when it comes to 
talking about death, even for 
professionals.
Aspecial project that Sharapan 
is working on now involves help
ing to develop the accompanying 
booklets for the American Cancer 
Society video tapes that Mister 
Rogers Neighborhood has pro
duced. In a way, she is close to the 
medical profession that she had 
once hoped for, as she provides a 
kind of care and comfort to chil
dren who are sick and their par
ents. Weve made two video tapes 
for children who have cancer and 
two for the parents of such chil
dren. Ive worked with Fred on 
the accompanyingbookletsfor the 
children, and the staff of the hos
pitals that use the tapes. Now Im 
working on the parent's booklet. 
Today Sharapan is busy in 
childrens television; helping 
people, sick and well, young and 
old. But shes also learning. I 
guess thats one of the most won
derful things about my job. Even 
though its been the same title, 
Associate ProducerI dont work 
in terms of production and some
times joke that it just means I get 
to associate with the producer  
it has given me so many chal
lenges in so many directions that 
Im constantly learning.
She has the glow of a person 
who has fulfilled her childhood 
dreams. Through Mister Rogers 
Neighborhood, Hedda Sharapans 
life has come full circle.

their way through miles of black

sticks might prove to be my ticket 
nto some much needed excite

offered her one, she accepted, and 
1SI reached forward to light the 
smoker hanging from the corner 
of her mouth I noticed tears 
streaming out of her eyes, like 
hickens hanging upside-down 
'rom a clothesline in a Chinaown street market. I asked her 
ivhy she was wasting her bodily

began my investigation.
I ventured out into the livable 
city. I loved Pittsburgh, to me it 
had always been the kind of town 
which existed only in black and 
white and moved to the sound of 
klanking saxophones. I soon 
found out that this was the result 
of excessive soot and the Kiltie 
Band, but the city lost none of its 
appeal for me. I turned on to the 
Cut and there I saw the prize I 
sought.
Hunt Library loomed before me 
like a bloated aluminum fish. 
Apparently Roy Hunt, then Presi
dent of Alcoa Aluminum gave the 
library to the school under the 
condition that it be built entirely 
out of aluminum. I found little 
comfort in this, but was thankful 
that he did not run a manure 
company. At any rate, another 
condition under which the library 
was built was that the top floor 
be devoted entirely to a compre
hensive collection of botanical 
research tomes. Yep, Roys wife 
was a plant freak, thats right, a 
plant freak, a veggie vixen, a 
horticultural harebrain, a legume

walking around without the 
knowledge of sprouts and roots 
apparently sickened her.

acts. Each individual reacts to 
stresses differently, and each case 
is distinct.
However, some factors seem to 
De consistent whenever an indi
vidual begins to seriously con
sider suicide. Noted psychologist 
Edwin Shneidman, professor at 
University of California, has, in 
the last 40 years, treated hun
dreds of people with suicidal 
tendencies. In his article, At the 
Point of No Return (Psychology 
Today, March 1987) he states 
that Underlying all of these 
isuicide attempts) is ... the feel
ing that no one can help with this 
pain and that there is nothing to 
lo except commit suicide.
This feeling of complete hope
lessness characterizes a major
ity of the suicide attempts. The 
suicidal person tends to view his 
future rather narrowly. Suicidal 
individuals see only two options: 
dealing with the unbearable pain 
that exists in their lives, or end
ing it all. A friend or counselor is 
'vise to help the a suicidal person 
to broaden his perspective. Sh
neidman begins his therapy by 
asking the person to list all of the 
possible options or alternatives 
available to them. Then, even if
seem unacceptable, the per
son is asked to rank the options. 
Eventually, the person will come 
o decide which option is the best 
for them.
However, these methods are 
nly useful when a suicidal per
son is behaving rationally. This 
ls not always the case. If you 
notice someone about to jump off
a bridge, he is probably not 
interested in listing his options, 
instead, use your own judgement, 
and try to keep talking to the 
individual until professional help 
arrives.
Wha:t can you do if you suspect 
* friend is considering suicide? 
f lrst, it is important to use your 
judgement. If you think someone 
ls suicidal, take steps to secure
I stepped through the foyer of 
Hunt Library and was startled 
by the deafening noise inside. I 
hurried past the hordes of stu
dents fighting one another for 
the privilege of reading the latest 
issues of Gourmet and Mother 
Jones and The Christian Science 
Monitor. As the desk attendant 
busied herself scooping up the 
remains of two frazzled students 
who had torn each other to bits 
over the latest issue of Preven
tion, I stepped into the elevator 
and pressed the fifth button. I 
felt the adrenaline streaming 
through my body like Squeeze 
Parkay at a corn-on-the-cob eat
ing contest.
The three hour elevator ride 
came to an end and the door 
opened before me. There, I saw 
the most horrifying sight I have 
ever been a privy to. No, it wasnt 
Professor Swedlows grading 
policy, or the Tartan Cheerleading Squad or even the plans for 
the new campus, it was...
ANDREW CARNEGIE!
Encased in a huge block of ice, 
a network of tubes and electrodes 
ran from him to a nearby Andrew 
Workstation. Apparently the 
IBM which built the Andrew 
System was not International 
Business Machines, the AllAmerican, Blue-Chip corporation 
which has brought joy to so many 
of us. It was IBM, Internal Brain 
Manipulations, the nefarious 
combine of Mind Control special
ists bent on ruling the world by 
harnessing the brain power of 
dead people!
Before I could do anything I 
felt something hit me on the back 
of the head like an atomic bomb. 
A stream of curses spewed forth 
from my lips like bad metaphors 
as the world swirled around me 
like Brie in a Quisinart. This 
whole thing stank like a scottie 
dog after a rainstorm, and I knew 
that I might not live to tell the 
tale....

Steams kicks off Sex at 8
THEARENew soHc uate Sl
impulse, as it affects college 
campuses, has been an amaz
ing behavioral sluggishness in 
adjusting sexual behavior to 
known disease problems in the 
nineteen eighties. I find this, 
quite understandable, all of us 
wish the new problems werent 
there. I also find it, risky and a 
result of a failure to recognize 
that too much sexual ambition, 
too much effort to make sex a 
bigger deal than perhaps it may 
be, is just as unhinged as the 
obvious Victorian extremes.
Stearns summarized that a 
certain balance is needed. The 
extent at which sex is an impor
tant expression of the individual, 
pleasure, the body, may need to 
be checked. We also may need to 
be aware that heavy focus on the 
Victorian tradition of placing too 
much stake on sexuality among 
the variety of pleasures that are 
available to a human being is a 
mistake as well.
And with that... Stearns con
cluded, Any lecture on sex should 
end, I think, with Thank you for 
coming.

help. On campus, the most im
mediate alternative is to call the 
counseling center at x2922. If it 
is after hours, a counselor will be 
paged. Then, realize that the 
person is in a great deal of pain. 
LISTEN to both the content and 
feeling of his words, without criti
cizing or judging the individual. 
Try to encourage the person to 
share his feelings, fears, and pain 
with you, and be generally sup
portive. Help the person to be 
aware of his alternatives. Stay 
with the suicidal person, espe
cially if you believe that the per
son is in immediate danger. If a 
suicide attempt has been made, 
call Campus Police, x2323. Urge 
the person to seek professional 
help, or call heip immediately if 
necessary.
Those who attempt suicide do 
not truly want to die. They wish 
only to find an end to their pain, 
a solution to their problems, or a 
place of peace. Because they are 
overwhelmed with the many feel
ings and stresses in their life, 
they see only a few alternatives, 
and sometimes choose suicide as 
a way out.
Rarely can a person attempt 
suicide without having any re
grets; regrets for the loss of their 
own life and for what could have 
been. The most important thing 
to remember is that the suicidal 
period is a temporary one. Al
most all of us have thought about 
suicide at least once in our lives. 
Yet, thinking about suicide is a 
lot less serious than serious con
templation of taking your own 
life. If you are seriously consider
ing suicide as an alternative, you 
need to get help to see you through 
this critical period. The aid of 
friends and professionals can 
make sure that you realize that 
your pain can be eliminated and 
that your life can be fulfilling 
again.
We need to stop suicide before 
it stops us, and the people that 
we love.

, we did 
Pitt!
The local Pittsburgh daily pa(ers do a very interesting and, I 
3el, important thing whenever 
hey have to fill some extra 
pace on the Sports or Features 
s. They print three or four 
Sttle historical blurbs, usually 
mder the heading It Happened 
... [Sports, News or Features].i
S Over the weekend I found an 
interesting historic fact that 
jccurred exactly 50 years ago, 
last Saturday. The year was 
(for all of you English and/ 
dr Art Majors out there) and 
Carnegie Tech had just defeated 
he Pitt Panthers 20-10 in front 
If a crowd of 61,000 people in 
>itt stadium. At first I just 
hought this was a novel piece 
}f sports or even Pittsburgh his
tory  a great many people who 
Ire from this area know what a 
botball powerhouse Carnegie 
t'ech once was.
I read further to discover that 
he date itself was significant 
lot so much of the game, but 
)ecause of what happened 
Afterwards. The Board of Direcors at Tech declared November 
i, 1938 to be a holiday from 
ilasses. This win broke a 10 
rear losing streak for Tech 
igainst the Panthers. It also 
hattered a 22 game seasonal 
/in streak for Pitt, which, subequently, cost Pitt a shot at the 
lational championship that 
'ear.
Imagine, cancelling classes 
tnd declaring a day of holiday 
imply because of a simple 
botball game? Such things only 
lappen in the south where the 
leople are Bohemians living 
inly to see the Georgia Bulldogs 
Let the Big Dawg Eat! or to 
loller RROOLLLL TIDE! in 
Uabama territory. These types 
f schools, people, and commulities are the ones who are 
xpected to worship college 
botball as the Carnegie Tech 
'artans did in 1938. Right?
To make such a base assumpion is to forget the one very 
mportant reason as to why the 
io^rd did what it did. By declar
ing a holiday on this day, the 
tudents and the entire Tech 
ommunity could come together 
o share in the wonderful joy 
nd pride associated with going 
o a truly great university. This 
vas not an act of folly on the 
art of some over zealous ad
ministrators, but rather a well 
hought out plan to bring some 
mity, and a sense of tradition 
o a campus that, like most of 
he country at this time, was 
ojjng through some very hard 
imes prior to World War II. 
Dont worry though, such a 
ling would never happen here 
t[Carnegie Mellon. Remember, 
$d not learn about this 
tyque piece of our schools 
Gritage here, but rather from a 
eal newspaper. How can 
cnool spirit (i.e. pride, tradi10n, a sense of heritage) expect 
ibe fostered when our own 
ct)ol forgets or ignores its own 
!pt? We should cherish the fact 
h&t we are students of Carne
ys Mellon  not just Greeks, 
irj|ists or athletes.
1 also find it unique that so 
n^ch of this heritage was, and 
l0*netimes still is based on or 
lrpund sporting events. Now, 
jjkge sports, at least here at 
fU, are considered 
important and even base by 
ny here. Theyll just never 
0w what theyre missing out

Tartans close out PACs with 14-6 loss
By STEWART LEVINE
Tartan Contributing Editor
When Carnegie Mellon (5-3-1, 
2-3-1 Presidents Athletic Confer
ence) and Washington and Jeffer
son (7-0-1, 6-0 PAC) get together 
for a football game, its usually a 
dandy.
Last years match-up was a 38- 
36 scoring free-for-all at Tech 
Field. This years was a defensecontrolled game at a muddy Col
lege Field at W & J. The result 
was the same thoughthe Presi
dents defeating the Tartans to 
clinch a PAC title.
The weather set the stage for
the game; a heavy rain storm left 
the field with the most mud south 
of the East Campus Project. Al
though the game matched up the 
leagues two best offenses, only 
three touchdowns were scored in 
W & Js 14-6 victory.
The Tartans ground game was 
especially hurt by the poor foot
ing, as well as the strong play of 
the Presidents defensive line. 
After racking up an average of 
243 rushing yards in their first 
eight games, Carnegie Mellon was 
held to a mere 105 yards on the 
ground in this game.
Without a running game, the 
Tartans struggled. Their first five
drives netted two first downs and 
and five punts. Their final drive 
came near the end of the first half 
and got as far as the W&J 20. Jim 
Kelly was called on to attempt a 
field goal, but his kick fell short. 
This was the teams last chance to 
score before the half.
The Presidents were likewise 
having problems. John Ivory 
missed two field goal attempts for 
W & J in his five trips on to the 
field. CMU senior Kent Hess then 
intercepted a.pass in the end zone 
to end a scoring threat.
The halfs only score came 
midway through the first quar
ter. On third and one, W&J tailphoto by Andy Gillespie
Senior Bobby Patterson struggles to keep his footing as he follows offensive guard Robert DeLisio through 
a gap on the muddy grass at W & Js College Field last Saturday.
back Larry Pitts broke for the 
right sideline and outran the rest 
of the players for a 59 yard touch
down run.
The ground game finally got 
into gear late in the third quarter. 
The Tartan backs found holes 
behind the right side of the line 
and moved the ball down the field 
in fourteen plays. On fourth down 
and two at the Presidents 3 yard 
line, the team went for the touch
down. Chris- Hansen broke the 
line and closed the score to 7-6.
The Tartans did not go for the 
tie, though. Head Coach Rich 
Lackner kept the offense on the 
field to attempt the two point 
conversion. As long as Im coach 
of this team, he proclaimed af
terwards, we will not play for a 
tie. However, Quarterback Steve 
Paternos pass was picked off by 
the Presidents Chris Bosser, pre
serving W&Js one point lead.
The Presidents immediately 
added an insurance score. W&J 
quarterback Pat Aigner found an 
open Andrew Pacak for a 48 yard 
gain. On the next play, Aigner 
hooked up with Stephen Lockridge for a 13 yard touchdown 
pass, padding the Presidents lead 
14-6.
Next Week: Carnegie Mellon 
closes out its season in Cleveland 
against University Athletic Asso
ciation rival Case Western Re
serve University. After several 
years of being the best Division 
III team in Ohio, the Spartan 
program has fallen onto hard 
times. Last year, Case suffered 
its first losing season since 1981.
Last season, the Tartans es
caped with a 13-12 victory at a 
rain-soaked Tech Field^ After 
taking a 13-0 lead, Case Reserve 
climbed back into the game with 
touchdowns in the third and 
fourth quarters. However, the 
point-after attempt on the first

Senior Chris Hansen looks on from ;

as bad a beating as the Tartans. !
score was missed, and a two-point j 
conversion pass failed with a! 
minute remaining.
The rivalry between Carnegie' 
Mellon and Case Reserve dates; 
back to the old Carnegie Tech-; 
Case Tech clashes and continued J 
while the two teams were mem! J

after the 1984 season. The game | 
between the two teams is dubbed!

Volleyball season dwindles to a close
By NATALIE HAWRYLUK
Tartan Assistant Sports Editor
The CMUs Womens Volleyball season came 
to an end this week. The Lady Tartans lost their 
final match to the Lady Bisons of Bethany, 14- 
16, 15-3, 5-15, 15-13, 15-11.
CMU won the first game of 
the best of five match, 16-14.
However, in the second game, 
the Lady Tartans failed to 
convert free balls by Bethany 
into points. With a 7-3 lead,
the Lady Bisons pulled them- __________________
selves together. Behind the sammmtmmmm 
service of sophomore Heather Kidder, Bethany 
scored the next eight points and won, 15-3.
Senior Diane Watson gave CMU a quick 4-0 
lead in the third game. It was marked by long 
rallies which ended with errors rather than kills 
for either side. Taking advantage of Bethanys 
lack of power hitting, Carnegie Mellon put the
game out of reach, 15-5.
Game four saw the lead change hands five times 
and tied at 11, 12 and 13 points. The Lady Bisons 
took a 2-0 lead, but the Lady Tartans made it 4-2 
before Bethanys Heidi Fakes put five points on the 
board. Junior Kris Loh countered with four cons e c u t i v e 
points, put
ting CMU in 
front, 10-7.
Bethany 
went ahead 
10-11, 11-12 
and 12-13, but 
Carnegie Mel
lon managed to tie the score each time. The teams 
effort was not enough as Bethany went on to win, 
15-13.

Volleyball team recaps seasonA closer look at one of CMUs winning athletes...
Dave Supp will try to add the title of AllAmerican to his collection this weekend
By ROBIN HENSINGER
Tartan Staffwriter
Dave Supp, CMUs #1 CrossCountry runner, who was recently 
awarded University Athletic 
Association Athlete of the week 
and the Most Valuable Player for 
the Presidents Athletic Confer
ence, is looking to become an AllAmerican runner at Nationals on 
November 19th.
Ever since freshman year 
Supps goal was to be an AllAmerican, which means coming 
in the top 25 in the nation. This 
year he is having 
his best season 
ever, and has 
trained hard and 
put everything on 
the line to achieve 
his goal.
Supp started 
running X-C for 
Carnegie Mellon 
his freshman year 
and became the # 1 
man on the team 
after only two 
meets. Although 
he and Len ONeal 
were labeled the 
Freshman To 
Watch, no orte expected him to do 
so well right away. He not only 
came in first for the team at the 
meets, he also won the PAC that 
year.
Tartan: How did it feel to be the 
best runner for CMU your 
freshman year?
Supp: It was a confidence 
builder. Since the program here 
is so good,you expect it of yourself 
to run well.
Tartan: How did you expect to 
run at PACs?
Supp: Since CMU always wins 
PACs I felt that I was supposed to 
win it as the top runner.With the 
reputation that we have here you 
make it happen.
Tartan: Were there any differ
ences between high school and 
college cross-country?
Supp: Yes, the races are longer. 
They are now 5 miles instead of 
3.1miles. After the first 3 miles 
you go through the high school 
blues because your body is ready 
to stop, but there are still 2 miles 
to go.
Supp obviously got over the 
high school blues after the 
second meet 
and ran con
sistently in 
first place for 
the team for 
the rest of th e 
season. Com
ing off an 
awesome 
freshman 
year, how
ever, he suffered the Sophomore 
Slump. He was plagued with 
tendonitis in his knees which 
made it extremely painful to run, 
but that did not stop him. He took 
a lot of time off from practice 
during the track season his 
freshman year due to the injury. 
He hardly trained the summer 
before his sophomore which led to 
a difficult X-C season.
Tartan: After having an incred
ible first year on cross-country, 
what was your second season like?
Supp: I had a couple of the worst 
races of my life that season. I had 
to drop out of the IUP invitational, 
which I had never done before. I 
was out of the top seven for the 
team at a few dual meets. I didnt 
know if it would get better.
Tartan: We know by your cur
rent success this year that things 
did get better for you. When did 
things start to turn around?
Supp: I did exercises with 
weights to strengthen my knees 
and it started getting better but 
they bothered me occasionally. I 
got myself up for the big races 
(PACs, UAAs and Nationals). At 
Nationals I was just lucky to be 
there because the team qualified 
without me. I wanted to run well 
for the team.
Supp came through for the team 
that year at nationals placing 33rd 
in the nation and the first of 
CMUs runners to cross the finish
line. Ever since then he has been 
running like a man possessed. 
He not only became the top run
ner for CMU again, but he re
claimed his PAC champion title.
Tartan: How did you know that 
you were coming out of your 
slump?
Supp: During track season, my 
knees hurt less, and I could tell 
that I was coming out of it.
Tartan: When did you start to 
train full-time again?
Supp: I dedicated the summer 
to running. I ran every day, and 
my schedule revolved around 
practice. I trained 
with the top run
ner from Pitt 
which really 
helped. As my 
high school coach 
says, work 
through the sum
mer and youll 
have an enjoyable 
fall.
Tartan: Areyou 
concerned that 
your knees will 
cause you more 
problems?
Supp: No, not 
this season. My 
training over the summer will 
carry me over to regionals and 
nationals. I knew that even if I 
didnt run my best this season, I 
would at least run respectably. 
But since I dont know how my 
knees will be next year I have to 
go all out this year, while Im 
running well. Ive committed 
myself this year to go for AllAmerican. Ive got to do it now.
It is easy to see how important 
running is in Supps life. He takes 
it very seriously and consistently 
thinks about his next meet.
He lives with the X-C team 
which consists of some of his best 
friends. His love for funning is 
more than being number one on 
the team or having a few good 
races.
Tartan: If you only run about 
six important races a year, what 
keeps you running the other 359 
days of the year?
Supp: I love to run, it is a re
lease for me when I can forget 
about everything but my running 
goals. Its a good time to be alone, 
and clear my head. Running gives 
me a real sense of accomplish
ment. Its one 
sport where 
its just you 
against an
other person, 
with no help 
from equip
ment or .any
one else. Al
though your 
teammates 
can run with you they cant help 
you as they can in other sports. 
You are out there on your own for 
25 minutes. When youve trained 
hard, you go into a race feeling as 
if youve done your homework and 
youre going to ace the test. An 
important part of running is 
having a mental toughness. On 
the day of a race, nothing that 
youve done before matters ex
cept how you do that day.
Tartan: Besides your loye for 
running, is there anyone in 
particular that gives you 
inspiration?
Supp: My parents, they come to 
just about every race, no matter 
where it is, and they are very 
supportive. My two cross-country 
coaches, my high school coach, 
Phil Shar, and Coach Meckley. I 
still call Mr. Shar sometimes 
before an important race and it 
helps. Coach Meckley is a big 
inspiration, he tells me what he 
thinks I can do and I do it. He 
thinks that I can be All-American, 
and that makes me think I can. 
Also having my friends there at a 
race helps me.
Tartan: How do you expect the 
team to do this year at Nationals?
Supp: Last year we were ninth 
in the nation, and we hope to be in 
the top five this year, and to be 
the best cross-country team that 
CMU ever had.
Supp plans to continue running
after college. Despite his injuries, 
he has risen to the top again this 
year proving his athletic ability 
and his desire to become an AllAmerican runner. With his deter
mination and talent, that goal is 
within his grasp.

sophomore Nicole Hanak, CMU 
was down, 9-0. Offensive and 
defensive errors by the Lady 
Tartans contributed more to the 
lead than the Bethany offense. 
Although they came close, the 
Lady Tartans were not able to 
bridge the gap. The Lady Bisons won, 15-11.
I felt worse for the people in 
the stands who had to watch us 
play so badly, said sophomore 
Cindy Peperak.
Tuesdays game against Hiram 
was forfeited by CMU due to a 
lack of players.
The Lady Tartans finished their 
1988 campaign 5-7 in both the 
PAC and the University Athletic 
Association. The teams overall 
record is 14-21.
It was such an Up and down 
season. Wed play well against 
the good teams, like NYU, and 
bad against the bad teams, like 
Bethany, said Watson.
I didnt feel there was enough
overall team dedication, said" 
Peperak. Team spirit has to 
be there, and we look to our. 
captains for that. I admire-' 
Nicole. She puts her injuries 
behind her, goes out and does 
the job and worries about her 
pain after the match. Shes the 
kind of captain a team needs/' 
Well do better next year,3' 
Most of us are coming back an'f1 
will have the experience of 
playing together, said fresh
man Deb Perry.

WHICH ONE WOULD YOU RATHER WRITE?
When you spend four years becoming a 
leader, it shows. And thats what Army ROTC 
is all about.
Fact is, when you graduate from college 
with a Lieutenants gold bar, youll bring more 
than a degree and a better resume to a job 
interview. Youll bring confidence and the 
knowledge that youve done something that 
will make you a desirable candidate in the job 
market. A competitive edge few people your 
age have. Something you can be proud of.
So take a good look at Army ROTC. It just 
might help potential employers take a good 
look at you.

ijoyed success from the mid- week. A week in hockey in which 
xties on through the seventies four players received match 
penalties, resulting in immediate 
suspensions for the players 
involved. Each incident was 
unnecessary and all can be 
attributed to the recent trend 
towards physical play and the 
protecting of the teams stars.
the National Hockey League. 
The Big Bad Bruins of Boston 
uscled their way to two Stanley 
gups and four conference 
ampionships in the early 
verities.

jgraded it, and earned the 
ickname The Broad

upont, the Flyers 
rrorized the NHL for 
arly a decade, winning 
;anley Cups in 1974 and 1975 
id the Campbell Conference 
hampionship in 1976.
In the mid-eighties there were 
sically two powers in the NHL. 
ie Flyers were the first, a shade 
ned down from, but by no means 
stant from their seventies 
unterparts. The other team was 
[he Edmonton Oilers, 
iladelphias success stemmed 
im outstanding defense and 
jaltending, and aggressive, 
ysical forechecking. The Oilers 
the other hand were the golden 
ys of the NHL. Their high 
,vered offense shattered almost 
ry record in the book.
Since general managers 
sually try to build their teams 
ised on the successful teams of 
lat era, most G.M.s of 
ebuilding teams during this 
Hod had two choices to make, 
hd since not everyone had a 
ayne Gretzky, teams chose to 
uild on solid goaltending, 
gressive forechecking, and hard 
tting, back checking defenders, 
nong these teams are the New 
rsey Devils, Boston Bruins and 
i\v York Rangers. These teams 
icame successful with their 
ysical styles of play.

 Pittsburgh Penguin, 
Steve Dykstra
First, Edmonton center Mark 
Messier dislodged a few of 
Vancouvers Rich Sutters teeth 
on Sunday, October 23. Messier 
received a six game suspension, 
without pay.
That Thursday, Flyers right 
wing Rick Tocchet gouged at the 
eye of the Islanders Dean 
Chynoweth during a brawl at the 
Spectrum. Tocchet was suspended 
for ten games, without pay.
The next night in Vancouver 
(the Hard Luck Team of the week), 
the Chicago Blackhawks and the 
Canucks engaged in a brawl after 
the game. The NHL suspended 
Chicagos Dave Manson for 
deliberate attempt to injure 
when he kneed Dave Bruce in the 
head. According to league rules, 
A player who instigates a fight 
other than in the time during the 
periods of the game shall be 
automatically suspended without 
pay for ten games. Later in the 
lats Naslund) and the Winnipeg week the NHL rescinded the last

eir rosters. did not determine whether he
Personal protectors are usually started the fight.
In Philadelphia Saturday night, 
New York Rangers defenseman 
James Patrick cross checked the 
Flyers Ron Sutter in the face. 
Sutter received a broken jaw from 
the blow and will be out for at 
least three weeks. The NHL has 
yet to announce its decision 
against Patrick.
The violent week culminated 
Sunday, October 30 in Madison 
Square Garden where the 
Rangers David Shaw viciously 
slashed at Pittsburgh Penguin 
Mario Lemieux, striking him 
above the left ear and in the chest. 
 Shaw was suspended for 
twelve games, without pay, 
for the attack. However, 
the suspension wasnt 
enough to satisfy some of 
the Penguin players.
After the game, one of 
Lemieuxs personal 
protectors, Steve Dykstra, 
felt it necessary to inform 
the world of his future 
intentions. Next time we 
play New York, [Shaws] dead, 
promised Dykstra. And if he 
doesnt have the [courage] to dress 
[i.e. play in the game] Ill get him 
in the stands. These ridiculous 
threats not only taint the NHLs 
already poor image, but border on 
the criminal.
The Rangers General Manager, 
Phil Esposito, expressed his 
concern for his players safety by 
promising to press criminal 
charges against Dykstra or any 
Penguin who attacks Shaw in 
their next game with the Pen
guins, January 14, in Pittsburgh. 
New York plays Pittsburgh on 
November 23, but Shaws sus
pension runs past that game.
The game aint played with 
skirts on. is a common defense 
football and hockey coaches give 
when their players occasionally 
get out of line. Hockey is a contact 
sport in which aggressiveness 
and good, clean hitting wins 
teams championships. Addition
ally the NHL and its fans accept 
spontaneous fights as part of the 
game, but the question we must 
ask ourselves and league 
president John Ziegler is, Where 
do we draw the line?
To his credit, Ziegler has begun 
to get tough. The ten and twelve 
game suspensions to Tocchet and 
Shaw represent 12.5% and 15% 
respectively of their total salaries. 
However, how can the league 
justify these suspensions unless 
it deals with all serious situations? 
Patrick of the Rangers has yet to 
be and probably will not be 
punished, and someone must be

By KEVIN BARNEY
Tartan Staffiuriter
In IM Soccer last week, Air 
Force ROTC met Pilam in a 
defensive battle of wits on a 
mud-covered field.
Pilam kicked off in the first 
half and immediately put the 
pressure on the Air Force 
defense. Tom Killeen led a 
strong Air Force defense which 
stopped Pilam cold.
For the first ten minutes, the 
ball never crossed the midfield 
mark. Six saves by the Air Force 
goalie managed to keep the 
game scoreless.
Air Force finally got the ball 
down the field. On their first 
offensive possession, Billy 
Besselman broke free of the 
crowd and went one-on-one 
with Pilams goalie. Besselman 
faked a kick to the left and 
scored by kicking to the right. 
The goalie slipped in the mud 
and went down as the ball went
into the net.
Pilam kicked off for the second 
time in the first half with only a 
few minutes left to play in the 
half. They put the pressure on 
and almost scored. When the Air 
Force goalie slipped and fell in 
the mud, Killeen came in and 
prevented a Pilam player from 
scoring. The first half ended with 
Air Force leading, 1-0.
The second half started with an 
Air Force kickoff. The playing got 
a bit fierce with several dangerous 
play calls. Again it was all a 
defensive battle. Neither team 
could get anything accomplished 
offensively.
At about eleven minutes into 
the half, Pilam applied more 
pressure. On one shot, the Air 
Force goalie hit the ground with 
another player when the ball 
rolled in front of the goalie. 
Whoever recovered the ball would 
get a free shot. Another Pilam 
player reached the ball first, but 
he slid into it causing the ball to
go out of bounds.
After the goal kick, Pilam 
brought the ball right back to 
the Air Force goal. Jay 
Schleicher scored on a quarter 
field shot for Pilam.
With the game tied at one 
goal apiece, and only a few 
seconds left to play in the game, 
Pilam successfully drove the 
ball down the field. The ball 
was kicked hard towards the 
net, but on a diving catch the 
Air Force goalie saved it, thus 
pushing the game into 
overtime.
In sudden death overtime, 
the first team to get a break 
was Air Force. With a hands 
penalty called in front of 
Pilams goal, Air Force got a 
penalty kick.
Again, neither team was able 
to score and the five minutes 
allotted for overtime quickly 
ran out. After a hard fought 
contest, both teams had to 
settle for a 1-1 tie.

held responsible for the post-game 
brawl between Chicago and 
Vancouver.
There are two possible 
solutions. First, if the league has 
concluded that a player has 
deliberately injured another, that 
player should be suspended for a 
set amount of games, without pay, 
or for as long as the injured player 
is out of action due to the injury 
inflicted by his attacker, which 
ever is longer. For example, if 
Patrick were to be found at fault 
for Sutters broken jaw, he would 
have to sit out, without pay, until 
Sutter was given the OK to return 
by his team doctor. Additionally, 
Shaw would still have to be out 
for twelve games even though
Lemieux was able to play in the 
Penguins next game.
Second, coaches should 
somehow be held responsible. 
This would put a better control on 
personal protectors. Since these 
players serve mainly to fight 
opponents who hurt their star 
teammates, the league could 
suspend both the personal 
protector and the coach.
The most important step 
towards curing the violence 
problem in the NHL is for the 
league to admit it has a problem. 
These ideas may not be the best 
or most practical, but Ziegler must 
start working. Its time the Na
tional Hockey League becomes 
known for its great teams and 
players, not its great fighters.

WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 9 
AND
THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 10
All undergraduate and graduate students (except CIT/MCS freshmen) are expected to advance register on November 9 or 10 if they wish to enroll 
at Carnegie Mellon for Spring 1989. If you won't be returning for reasons other than graduation, please complete an Application for Withdrawal/ 
Leave of Absence (clearly marked "Spring 1989") and submit the application to your department. If you are unable to register on November 9 or 
10, ask your advisor to process your registration, or call the Registrar's Office for special instructions.
You will use the Registration and Demographic Data Document (R3D) to update demographic information and to register for courses. Your R3D 
is available in your department; H&SS freshmen and sophomores may pick up their R3Ds in the Academic Advisory Center, Baker Hall 161. 
CIT/MCS freshmen have received separate instructions and do not advance register at this time.
The Schedule of Classes Spring Semester 1989 is available at the Skibo Information Desk and inside Baker Hall's main entrance. The schedule 
contains Spring 1989 course offerings, instructors, times and rooms, as well as registration and enrollment instructions. Please obtain a copy, and 
carefully read and follow the instructions.
***** ADVANCE REGISTRATION INSTRUCTIONS*****
1. Pick up your R3D from your department and update/correct the demographic information.
2. Pick up a Schedule of Classes and prepare a tentative course schedule with alternatives.
3. Meet with your advisor to have the schedule approved. Many advisors will extend office hours during advance registration, but you should 
contact yours for specific approval information. Your R3D is not valid without advisor approval.
4. On November 9 or 10, between 9:30 am and 4:00 pm, go to the departments teaching the course(s) you wish to register for and obtain 
registration approval. Courses are not processed without department approval.
5. After obtaining all approvals, sign the R3D and return it to your department. Even if you don't obtain all department approvals, submit the 
R3D anyway; you can try to add an unapproved course in January.
If you need further information or assistance, contact your department or the Registrar's Office, 268-2004.
