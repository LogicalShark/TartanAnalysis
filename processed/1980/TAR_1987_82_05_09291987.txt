Campus Freedom of Speech Disputed
By CHRIS YOUNG
Tartan Staffwriter
During the past few weeks, concern has been 
growing among Carnegie Mellon faculty, staff 
and students about just who and what defines 
~ am pus freedom of speech.
Jonathan Pressler of the Philosophy Depart
ment and Kate Luxemburg of Administrative 
Systems have both voiced concerns in the 
September issue of Focus about the 
administrations policy on freedom of speech. 
In connection with their passing out leaflets 
raising questions about the SEI, both Pressler 
and Luxemburg have encountered conflict 
between what they thought was their right as 
members of the university to voice their opin
ions and what the administration sees as its 
duty to censor anything interrupting the nor
mal flow of business on campus, as Dean of 
Student Affairs, Brad Walter, phrases it.
According to Luxemburg, in Focus, On
Monday, Aug. 24, just as I gave away the last 
of the leaflets [about the SEI], a campus police 
officer approached me. She said, Weve had 
a complaint about you handing these things 
out A complaint about the leaflet, or a 
complaint about me? She looked away. My 
response to that look was a mildly paranoid 
feeling and a determination to show that I was 
doing nothing wrong. She asked for my name, 
phone extension, and office number, and 
asked whether I had my staff I.D. on me. 
Later Luxemburg writes, the officer said, 
There is no problem with free speech here. 
Everybody who wants to hand out anything, 
whether its pro the university or con the 
university, has to get permission from the 
Dean of Student Affairs first This is private 
property.
Pressler wrote, in the same issue of Focus, 
that he was told by Walter that the prior con
sent policy was intended to promote freedom
of speech by making sure that the campus was 
not overexposed to any one point of view. 
But Pressler does not accept this as being the 
true policy. According to him, There is a 
clear pattern in the administrations continu
ing efforts to restrict'speech and expression. 
So long as a messages content or form is 
innocuous, the university raises no objec
tions. But whenever critics of the university 
express their views in too public a way, the 
administration calls out its campus police. 
In addition to Pressler and Luxemburgs 
encounter with the universitys policy on free 
speech, Cheryl Sneed, a graduate student and 
member of Students Against Apartheid has 
also encountered difficulty voicing her views. 
According to Sneed, On September 11 at 
around 10:45 am while in front of Baker Hall 
distributing leaflets (which had already re
ceived approval through Student Affairs) 
about Apartheid, I was approached by a cam[Trailers

Van Mastrigt

Darrell Van Mastrigt, the former 
CMU student found guilty of killing a 
Robert Morris College student, was 
sentenced on the morning of September
22. After futile efforts by his attorney, 
Chas Scarlata, for the court to recon

tence of life imprisonment.
Van Mastrigt, 19, was charged on July 
16 with murder of the first degree of 
Jeanne Goldberg, 20, of Squirrel Hill. 
Her body was found naked from the 
waist down in South Park the morning 
of February 8. The night before, Van 
Mastrigt attended a party in Hamerschlag House where he was living and 
started drinking. Later, he met Gold

as a form of civil disobedience. I see the trailers 
as vandalism, said sophomore Todd Sanders. 
When asked about the vandalism, a group of 
people around the trailers applauded.
Some students view the action as unacceptable.
I think it is a ridiculous way of dealing 
with the problem, said student Greg 
Berry. Another said, I dont particularly 
like the trailers, but it is still vandalism. 
Security was unavailable for comment.
Art Students Outraged 
Over Studio Conditions
By JOSH RUBEN
Tartan Staffw riter
The Carnegie Mellon Art Department has 
come under attack by both students and faculty 
members this week following a lecture last 
Wednesday by Monona Rossol of Arts and 
Crafts Theater Safety (ACTS) in which she 
cited numerous safety hazards and potential 
violations after touring studios throughout the 
campus.
Rossol gave the lecture upon invitation by 
Glenn Kombrek, Dan Hendel, and Kate 
Temple, all students in the Art Department 
who have been quite critical of the 
Departments safety conditions. However, not 
all art students are up in arms over these condi
tions or what Rossol had to say. One under
graduate who wished to remain anonymous 
does not see any major problems. When I 
spray my hair in the morning its the same 
[fumes] as when I spray fixative on my paint
ings. She added that many artists use the same 
chemicals and materials in their homes as they 
do in the Departments studios, and they use
them the same way. I wouldnt want to have 
to put on a space suit to do a sculpture; it 
detracts from the art itself, she concluded.
Rossol has given many such lectures in 
which she cites problems in an art 
departments ventilation, storage, and dis
posal systems and then recommending pos
sible solutions. She is also an expert on the 
dangers of various chemicals and materials 
used by artists and recommends safer tech
niques or alternatives.
One of the most shocking comments Rossol 
made in her lecture came in relation to venti
lation systems and fire safety standards. A lot 
of these studios would be shut down immedi
ately if OSHA [Occupational Safety and 
Health Administration) ever investigated 
them.
OSHA spokesman, Ed Selker, stated that, 
[OSHA] has never had any complaints from 
anyone at Carnegie Mellon before." Based on 
its policies and guidelines, OSHA cant le

Semester Shift Update
Airline Offers 
Ticket Trade
By RUSS SELIGMAN
Tartan Editor-in-Chief 
Students and staff who were afraid that a 
change in travel arrangements resulting from 
the spring 1988 semester shift would cause 
them a financial loss may have nothing to 
worry about.
Any ticket for a flight to Pittsburgh on USAir 
between January 1-12, 1988 may be ex
changedwithout penaltyfor another 
ticket to Pittsburgh on any other day between 
January 1-12, provided the original ticket was 
purchased prior to October 1, 1987.
"We really appreciate what USAir has done 
for us, said Maryann P. Moore, Director of 
Special Events. Moore contacted USAir after 
several students approached her with com
plaints that they would have to pay airline 
penalties in order to change their travel ar
rangements to accommodate the new spring 
1988 calendar.
Members of the Carnegie Mellon commu
nity who wish to exchange their tickets should 
call (412) 922-7500, USAirs reservation 
number. They will need to know the name 
appearing on the ticket, the travel date, the 
flight number, and the special code AC544A. 
Anyone who purchased their ticket from a 
travel agency should report back to that 
agency with the above information and have 
the travel agent change the flight.
Moore encourages anyone who still has 
problems (i.e., flights on other airlines) to 
contact her at x5052.

U.S. Attacks Iranian 
Ship in Persian Gulf
MANAMA, Bahrain (AP)  The U.S. heli
copter attack last Monday on an Iranian ship 
planting mines in the Persian Gulf killed four 
Iranian crewmen. Pentagon officials said. Iran 
vowed the attack will not go unanswered.
It was the deadliest U.S. strike against Iran 
since the Reagan Administration began ex
panding the American presence in the gulf in 
July in an effort to protect Kuwaits tankers 
and keep the oil shipping lanes open.
U.S. Navy forces picked up Iranian crewmen 
from a life boat, including four wounded, 
according to the Pentagon.
Navy personnel found 10 mines on the at
tacked ship, the Iran Ajr, the Pentagon said. 
The amphibious landing craft was attacked 50 
miles northeast of Bahrain in international 
waters. Pentagon and White House officials
Tehran claimed the ship hit by U.S. helicop
ters was an unarmed cargo vessel and Iranian 
Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani 
categorically denied it was laying mines, 
according to Irans official Islamic Republic 
News Agency.
Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger, 
interviewed last week, said the navy will re
lease the detained Iranian crew members for 
repatriation within a few days.
Weinberger, on afive-day,trip to the Persian 
Gulf region, said the Iranian minelayer dis
abled and captured by U.S. forces would be
destroyed in the most effective way pos
sible.
Friday U.S. sailors placed explosives aboard 
the Iran Ajr, towed it to deep waters, and 
detonated the charges, sinking the ship.
Ortega Announces 
Partial Cease-fire
MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP)  President 
Daniel Ortega said the government would start 
a partial truce and withdraw troops to desig
nated areas to open the way to a total cease-fire 
with U.S.-supported Contra rebels.
We are working on concrete actions to 
make known the first zones where the cease
fire will be declared, Ortega said. He said the 
locations of the designated areas would be 
announced but did not specify a timetable.
At the news conference, the leftist govern
ment also announced that Radio Catolica, the 
Roman Catholic church radio station, could 
reopen immediately. Last week the opposition 
newspaper la Prensa was allowed to resume 
publication.
The announcements were the latest in a se
ries of government moves to comply with a 
Central American peace plan Ortega and the 
presidents of El Salvador, Honduras, Costa 
Rica and Guatemala signed on Aug. 7.
The plan calls for an end to outside military 
aid to insurgencies. It would require verifica
tion of a cease-fire and negotiations by Nov. 7.
The unilateral cease-fire offered by Ortega 
was rejected as inadequate by White House 
officials, who won some support from Costa 
Rican President Oscar Arias Sanchez.
I dont think a unilateral cease-fire would be 
enough. Both parties have to agree," said 
Arias, referring to efforts to end the conflict 
between Nicaraguas leftist Sandinista gov
ernment and the U.S.-backed Contra rebels.
Sen. Biden Pulls Out 
Of Presidential Race
WASHINGTON (DJ)  Sen. Joseph Biden, 
D-Del., announced Wednesday that he is with
drawing from the race for president.
Ive concluded that I will stop being a can
didate for president of the United States, 
Biden told a packed news conference on 
Capitol Hill.
Biden said that handling the chairmanship of 
the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is 
currently holding confirmation hearings on 
the nomination of Judge Robert Bork to the 
Supreme Court, and running for president 
under increased pressure would be impos
sible. He said he had a choice between running 
for president and doing his job, and chose the 
latter.
In my zeal to rekindle ... idealism, I made 
some mistakes, the senator said in reference 
to charges that he used quotations from other 
public figures without attribution. Biden was 
also hurt by revelations that he plagiarized 
legal works while he was in law school.
Poll Says More Oppose 
Bork Than Back Him
WASHINGTON  More Americans op
pose Judge Robert Borks elevation to the 
Supreme Court than favor it, and the people 
who say they know the most about him are the 
most opposed to him, according to a new
national Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll.
The survey of 1,544 adults conducted on 
Monday and Tuesday of last week found that 
42% oppose his confirmation, while 34% 
favor it and 24% arent sure. Among those 
who have read or heard a lot about Bork, 
negative opinion was even stronger: 53% of 
that group said Bork shouldnt be confimed 
and 38% said he should. ^
Thrity-nine percent of those polled agreed 
with the statement that Bork is too conserva
tive to be an effective member of the Supreme 
Court, while 34% agreed that his conserva
tive views will be an important addition to the 
courts.

time at several fraternity parties, and went 
to the O. Upon returning to campus, they 
had sex in Goldbergs car, and drove to 
South Park where he stabbed her numerous 
times. The next morning, Van Mastrigt vol
untarily provided information to the 
County Police and was arrested.
At the sentencing, the atmosphere of Van 
Mastrigt and Scarlata was that of hopeless
ness as Scarlata tried to bring up a few last 
points to the Common Pleas Judge Robert 
E. Dauer before the sentence wap handed 
down. The lawyer emphasized that the 
accused was so intoxicated with drugs and 
alcohol that he couldnt have consciously 
realized what he was doing at the time. 
However, the court rebutted this by stating 
that the fact that Van Mastrigt was able to
recall his actions the following morning 
made him accountable for the felony. Scar
lata then tried to clarify a reference to the 
occult by identifying a mural on [Van 
Mastrigt's] wall as a record album by 
Ozzy Osmond [Ozzy Osborne].
These actions were to no avail as Van 
Mastrigt was told, There is nothing that 
you can do to mitigate punishment.
After the sentence was given, Scarlata 
stated to Judge Dauer that Van Mastrigt 
expressed some dissatisfaction with my 
performance, and wished to have an attor
ney appointed to him by the court free of 
charge for the appealing of the case to the 
Superior Court of Pennsylvania.
The Board of Pardons will determine 
whether or not Van Mastrigt will be eli
gible for parole, and if so, when.
Crecines Departure Prompts Administrative Reorganization
By NATALIE CAPONE
Tartan Staffer iter 
With the resignation of Vice President of 
Academic Affairs Patrick Crecine,'the Ad
ministration has begun a reorganization proc
ess that Provost Angel Jordan says will en
hance the undergraduate experience at Car
negie Mellon. The changes include a re-divi
sion of power, as well as the development of a 
more University-wide Deans Council.
Under the new system, which Jordan said is 
basically in effect, but will formally begin on
November 1st, when Crecine begins his new 
post as President of Georgia Tech, all vice 
presidents will report directly to President 
Richard Cyert, and Jordan will oversee all 
academic units as well as the Deans Council.

U.S. Establishes Ties With Mongolia
By ERIC W. LEULIETTE
Tartan Assistant News Editor 
In a few months the United States will open 
a mission in the most remote capital in the 
world, Ulan Bator. The move is part of diplo
matic maneuvering by the three major super
powers that has caused the Mongolian 
Peoples Republic to be dubbed the pawn of 
geopolitics.
Though negotiations first began in 1972, the 
U.S. did not establish formal relations with
Mongolia until January. One of the first cul
tural exchanges between the two countries 
will occur this week at CMU. (See related 
article on the front page of Diversions).
Why is the State Department opening a 
mission now, when budget cuts have forced 
the closing of seven U.S. consulates in 1986 
and seven more this ypar? .
' The' bureaucrats down ift : Fog'gy: Bottom 
make no bones about their ulterior motives in 
Mongolia. They want a listening post and
Mongolianestled in between both the So
viet Union and Chinais the perfect place to 
keep a close eye on the two largest Communist 
countries.
But dont look for James Bond to be traipsing 
among the yurts of the capital. The U.S. wont 
have an embassy for at least two years; the 
mission will operate out of a hotel. Tempera
tures in the capital can reach 45 degres below 
zero, so diplomats will get a 25% hardship 
bonus in their pay.
They wont have much company in Ulan 
Bator. Other than Soviet bloc nations, only 
Britain, Japan, China, and India have diplo
mats in the capital.
The opening of ties comes at the same time as 
Soviet Leader Mikhail Gorbachev has been 
trying to use Mongolia to woo the Chinese. 
Last spring the Soviets withdrew one division 
of military forces that had been based there. 
Before the withdrawal, an estimated 60,000 
troops were in Mongolia as part of the Soviet 
Unions defense along the Chinese border.
The links between the Soviet Union and 
Mongolia have been strong since a large Red 
Army contingent liberated the capital in July, 
1921. Russian troops have been present since 
1966 after the Sino-Soviet split and the begin
ning of the Cultural Revolution in China.
Mongolia has all of the trappings of a Sovietstyle government: a secret police, collective 
farms, and a coordinated economy. Moreover, 
the language has been written in Cyrillic script 
since 1945.
Even though Mongolia may be considered a 
pawn now, its importance should not be dis
counted. Genghis Khan and his heirs con
quered China and extended the Mongol Em
pire to eastern Europe.
SEI Sparks Concern Over Freedom
out material about the SEI.
Campus Security denies any mention about 
the SEI during Sneeds questioning.
Brad Walter declares that members of the 
academic community have a right to protest 
anything they want unless they obstruct cam
pus walkways or make obscenities. Student 
Affairs must be shown what literature is being 
distributed in order to make sure it passes these 
requirements. A few years ago, we were con
fronted by one man who said that all he wanted 
to do was give a little Christian message to all 
the students. We told him that what he wanted 
to do was all right. But a couple hours later, he 
was running up and down Baker Hall banging 
on the classroom doors with a large wooden 
cross.
Dean Walter feels that what happened to
Sneed was that Campus Security was being a 
little overprotective. They were asked to make 
sure Student Affairs knows what views are 
being presented on campus. But there was just 
some miscommunication in Sneeds case. 
For people curious about handing out litera
ture on campus, Walter says, They should let 
Student Affairs know what they are handing 
out. Because, if they dont, then Security will 
ask them anyway whether Student Affairs 
knows about what they are handing out. If the 
person says no then Security should imme
diately make sure that Student Affairs finds 
out about it. Dean Walter reiterates that he 
wants to know whsfts going on. He defi
nitely thinks that there should be more politi
cal views voiced on campus, especially in light 
of the coming elections.
Pressler, however, in his letter in Focus,
says that the administration's attitude is 
unacceptable. It is time for the university to 
formulate and abide by a consistent, explicit, 
and public policy that protects and encourages 
freedom of expression on campus. Naturally, 
such a policy would protect those who make 
the administration nervous by openly and 
repeatedly questioning the wisdom or moral
ity of official decisions.
Because of all the turmoil involving campus 
freedom of speech. Faculty Senate has di
rected its committee on Faculty Affairs, 
headed by Professor Subhash Mahajan, to 
investigate the issue and try to dig up some 
kind of formal document of the universitys 
policy on free speech. The Faculty Senates 
next meeting is scheduled for October 15, and 
the Faculty Affairs committee will make their 
presentation on this issue at that date.
departments were under Crecine's direction, 
with the rest divided between Jordan and 
Cyert. The new arrangement will have a clear 
and efficient line of authority.
It will be more streamlined, Jordan said of 
the new system. Speaking about the division 
of responsibility between him and Crecine, 
Jordan said, Sometimes the lines were 
fuzzynow they'll be clear. All other institu
tions in the country have only one chief aca
demic officer."
As before. Vice President of Business Af
fairs Fred Rogers, Vice President of Develop
ment A1 Brannock, and Vice President of 
University Relations Keith Moore will be 
directly under Cyerts administration. Bill 
Arms, Vice President of Academic Services, 
who previously reported to Crecine. will now 
work directly with the President as well.
One of the biggest changes was in the role of 
William Elliott. Previously Vice President of 
Enrollment, Elliotts new title will he Vice 
President of Student Affairs. The new position 
will encompass the Dean of Student Affairs, 
the Athletic Department, the Teaching Center, 
and the Quality of Life office, as well as 
Elliotts prior responsibilities of Admissions, 
Financial Aid, Registrar, Career Services, 
International Student Program, Summer Pro
grams, C-MAP, and R^OTC.
. .The Quality of Life office will be responsible 
for studying the recommendations of the 
Quality of Life Task Force and implementing 
their suggestions, said Jordan! They will 
work closely with the Deans Council.
The Deans Council is another expansion of 
the new plan. Consisting of deans and depart
ment heads, the Council has existed as a forum 
to exchange information between the Deans, 
Provost, and President, said Jordan. But 
now it will take on a University-wide func
tion, with such committees as Educational 
Policy. Research Policy, Corporate Relations, 
Computing Policy, Government Relations, 
Strategic Planning, Quality of Life. Economic 
Development, Graduate Programs. Intellec
tual Property, and Academic and Business 
Affairs. Many of these tasks will work "on a 
continuum basis, explained Jordan, While 
others will be solved and we can go on to 
another agenda. The motivation for these 
added responsibilities came with the realiza
tion that The University does reasonably 
well, but it does not have firm, well-articulated 
policies. Instead of Cyert. Jordan and Rogers 
doing things at random, we'll have policies of 
how to do things well. He continued. "The 
Council will allow us to fill in the cracks 
between departments that are now compart
mentalized. We want to make them uniform 
and of a high quality."
The position of Provost will also be changed. 
Jordan will take responsibility for all of the 
academic units, which includes every college, 
Mellon Institute, Robotics Institute, and the 
Software Engineering Institute, as well as the 
Deans Council and Faculty Senate. The ViceProvost for University Studies (Preston 
Covey), Associate Provost for Research and 
Academic Administration (Anne Sigerstad), 
and Associate Provost for Human Resource 
Development and Equal Opportunity (Nor
man Johnson) will also report directly to Jor
dan.
This will mean that the President will have 
more functions, said Jordan. Hell have to be 
more on top of certain things, and he will have 
to delegate the responsibility. I, as Provost, 
will also have more to do, but the Deans 
Council will take up some of the slack.
1 feel very good about this, said Jordan. 
The student will see significant changes: in 
the quality of life, coordination in undergradu
ate programs, better advising, the impact of 
research on education. I promise that the 
undergraduate experience will be enhanced.

Rossol Cites Art Department Health Violations

partment] based solely on complaints from the 
students, according to Selker. Investigations 
are based strictly on an employer-employee 
relationship, said Selker. We can get in
volved if a teacher or faculty member lodges a 
complaint. Even in this case, OSHA would 
still rather have the school solve any problems 
on its own. Selker added, We only come in if 
there is no in house solution.
By citing many of these problems, Rossol 
mainly heightened the awareness of the stu
dents and teachers of the Art Department and, 
according to several students and teachers, 
made them both frightened and mad. Dan 
Hendel, for example, was quite adamant in his 
opinion on the inadequacy of the ventilation 
system in the Silk Screen studio in one of the 
basement rooms in Doherty Hall. Theyre 
square! stated Hendel, referring to the fact 
that the ducts are square shaped and not 
rounded as they should be according to 
Rossols lecture. With the square ducts, the 
fumes and vapors from the chemicals in the 
studios are not drawn out of the studios as 
efficiently as they would be with rounded 
ducts, according to Hendel. Rossol explained 
the reason for this type design in the studios is 
because the systems were designed by refrig
eration and heating designers instead of venti
lation designers.
Art Department faculty member, John Beckley, stated simply that, All of the studios 
should have better ventilation. Beckley 
commented on the fact that many of the studios 
have 10 to 15 students working at one time 
when the ventilation systems are only 
equipped to deal with a maximum of 5 stu
dents. However, Beckley does not think the 
problem warrants cutting down the sizes of the 
classes. The [ventilation] systems were inef
ficient when they were first put in, said Beck
ley, The fan belts are constantly 
breaking...the systems require a lot of serv
ice.
On a tour of the basement of Doherty, Beck
ley showed how the studios draw in air from 
research labs on the same level. He said that 
most of the fumes the labs put out can be 
considered hazardous. Sometimes, this thing 
is even on, he exclaimed as he showed off a 
vent leading from a lab right out into the hall 
which is the prime source of fresh air for most 
of the art studios.
In addition to the ventilation problems, 
Rossol also explained how many of the paints, 
inks, and other materials used by artists can be 
quite dangerous. Were switching to water 
based inks next semester, said Beckley in
regard to the inks used by the silk-screening 
artists. According to Rossol, oil based inks, 
which are currently in use by the department, 
are not as good as water based inks which do 
not carry the dangerous fumes as do the oil 
based. One of the most dangerous chemicals 
used by artists is turpentine. According to art 
student Mary Murphy, You would have to 
use gloves and change them every 15 minutes 
to prevent [turpentine] from getting into your 
skin., .and even then youre not safe.
The Art Department has begun to take steps 
to solve the problems. According to Depart
ment Head, Orville M. Winesand, each profes
sor will write down hazards that they see 
within the studios and then submit them to the 
department for inclusion in a 5 year renova
tion plan. In addition to this, 10 new steel 
waste disposal barrels have been ordered to 
prevent students from throwing used chemi
cals into the sinks and damaging plumbing. 
The department is also ordering non-re
moveable no-smoking signs, to insure that 
students will get the message that smoking is 
prohibited around certain chemicals and mate
rials in the studios.
Included with these immediate and long 
range plans, Beckley recommends that the 
school spend $1000 on a mandatory course 
for art students to teach them aboutsafety. He 
commented that basic housekeeping prac
tices by the students and teachers are some of 
the best ways to keep people safe in the stu
dios. He added that Even though some 
people do work hard to keep things safe...the 
school needs to put in the money. Beckley 
explained how he had to work for 18 months in 
order for the school to replace asbestos insu
lated steam pipes and frequently rattled and 
rained the asbestos down onto the students.United Way Kicks Off 1987 
Carnegie Mellon Fundraiser
By CHRIS CULVER
Tartan Staffwriter
The United Way of Southwestern Pennsyl
vania began its 1987 Carnegie Mellon fun
draiser last Friday in the GSIA building.
Three United Way officials spoke to Indus
trial Management graduate students about 
what the organization is, how it works, and the 
need for continual and growing support. 
According to David Fields, a graduate student 
at GSIA and the spokesperson for the organiz
ing group, the purpose of the CMU campaign 
was to expose business students to UW before 
they enter the work force and to get them to 
become socially responsible.
Recently, the UW Pittsburgh branch has 
suffered with the decline of large area indus
tries, US Steel being the largest, and many col
leges showed little interest in UW activities. 
CMU was the first university to invite UW to 
begin a campus fundraiser.
Although the United Way is publicly known, 
many people are unfamiliar with its functions. 
United Way of Southwestern Pennsylvania is 
a fundraising organization for more than 140 
agencies in the area, such as the YMCA, 
Multiple Sclerosis research, and elderly care. 
The purpose of UW is to centralize the fun
draising for all these causes. Since it is primar
ily run by volunteers, it is also the most cost 
effective way to raise money for them, with 
more than 90# for every dollar going to the 
charities.

Bruce Thomas, Vice Chairman of USX and 
also chairman of the regions 1987 fundraising 
campaign, said that President Cyert personally 
accepted a leadership role in this years local 
campaign. Currently there are 31 United Way 
volunteers at CMU.
In the past, the community looked toward the 
federal government for many of its charity 
funds. The United Way and other non profit 
organizations made up the remainder. Due to 
many cutbacks, federal funds have diminished 
recendy and the burden has fallen on the non 
profit sector. If you are interested in contribut
ing time or money, you can contact the United

A contract signed four months ago by 
Dow Jones and Carnegie Mellon allows 
access to the Dow News Service through 
Andrew and lets the publishing com
pany peek at research here.
According to Thomas E. Neudecker, 
Assistant Vice President for Academic 
Affairs, the agreement is a product of a 
wedding of an alumni. About a year ago 
Senior Vice President Patrick Crecine 
was introduced to an alumnis brother 
who works at Dow Jones.
After establishing that both institu
tions had mutual interests in technol
ogy and research problems, a series of 
meetings occurred prior to signing the 
contract.
Neudecker said Dow Jones has agreed 
to support one graduate student at CMU 
and provide the news service in ex
change for keeping abreast of research 
in natural language processing. In addi
tion, Dow Jones is also paying CMU for 
access to the research. I dont want to 
disclose the figure, but there is cash at 
hand, said Neudecker.
In addition to the bulletin boards avail
able through Andrew, ITC will set up a 
database of the postings, which would 
be incorporated into the University Li
braries database. Full text searching 
would be available through the system.
Over seventy bulletin boards are avail
able on Andrew. They range from gen
eral world and national news to news of 
the textile industry. Primarily, the 
boards are government and financial 
news.

Editor:
I wish to correct the many misconceptions 
in the letter of September 9 by Name 
Withheld.
The current directions of the Music De
partment are consistent with the 
Department's Strategic Planning goals es
tablished by the University and the Depart
ment of Music in 1986, which lists among 
its objectives to implement a world music 
experience and to redesign the departmen
tal curriculum to create robust programs 
that will take advantage of the existing 
music expressions in addition to the West
ern and Classical tradition.
One of the most important terms of ac
cepting the position of Head of the Depart
ment was to substantially increase new 
scholarship assistance. This request was 
backed by the administration with the as
surance that such-funding will increase 
from year to year.
The office of Financial Assistance has 
very clear policies concerning its support 
procedures. Reasons for decrease in schol
arship aid include lowering of academic 
level, increase in family income, etc. Such 
information is readily available from the 
Financial Aid office. There are certain 
funds allocated for financial aid and schol
arships, and other funds for program devel
opment and faculty. These monies are not 
interchangeable, and spending in one area 
does not necessarily affect the other.
I know of no instance of any musician 
who moved to Pittsburgh one week ago 
and was informed that the Department was 
short of funds and could not grant monies 
for graduation. If such a person exists, I 
would certainly welcome information on 
the circumstances involved.
The presence on our campus of a major 
international string quartet in residence is 
in line with the Presidents directive to 
create a truly significant world class depart
ment of international standing. The Cuar
teto Latinamericano was brought to CMU 
because they are an outstanding, profes
sional quartet with an international reputa
tion, which is as much for their perform
ance as for their repertoire, firmly 
grounded in the music of this century as 
well as of the past, and also features the rich 
repertoire of the bestbf the Latin American 
composers usually lacking in the repertoire 
of American quartets.
The Department does not employ a 
World Improv teacher, although we do
.have a class in improvisation with members 
of World Sound.
At this historical point in time, it is univer
sally recognized that Jazz and improvisa
tion are major creative forces in 20th cen
tury music. Simply because jazz studies 
have not previously been part of the cur
riculum at CMU, as well as courses in 
world music, is no argument for not intro
ducing them now and filling what was, in 
my opinion, a major deficit in the concept 
of the music program.
As far as classical Western music is con
cerned, we all know that Mozart, 
Beethoven, Schubert, Chopin were 
extraordinary improvisors  perhaps the 
greatest being J.S. Bach. We do not employ 
an East Indian music teacher, at least not in 
the way indicated in the letter. We are 
fortunate to attract an international popula
tion to our outstanding CMU graduate 
programs. This year we have a fine musi
cian from India in one of the science pro
grams. What an excellent opportunity for 
us to have him teach the south Indian drum, 
which comes form a tradition of classical 
music that is thousands of years old. We 
look to our student body as a valuable 
resource.
We are all members of the global village. 
Today, more than ever before, every art 
form is influenced, stimulated, motivated, 
and inspired by all of the worlds cultures. 
The year is 1987, not 1887, and to approach 
the process of music education through the 
study of only a few hundred years of West
ern music, as great as the tradition is, would 
continue to foster cultural xenophobia.
Where will it end? In a Department of 
Music that has a truly exceptional faculty, 
filled with marvelously gifted students, a 
program that reflects the incredible beauty 
of the worlds music and espouses the high
est level of artistic commitment. A begin
ning to be shared with the entire CMU 
community, the nation, and the world.
Our goal is to expand the musical con
sciousness of our students. We are not 
taking anything away by the changes we 
are instituting. We are adding on, increas
ing options, broadening our scope.
My door is always open to anyone who 
wishes to meet with me to ask questions, 
offer advice, seek clarification and share 
ideas.

Slightly to the left...Reagan CONTRAry to the Public Interest
By MICHAEL WITBROCK & 
MICHAEL FRANZINI
President Reagan wants Congress to give 
$270 million more to the Contras. There is no 
reason why Congress should do so. To grant 
C uch a large amount of money to support the 
attempted overthrow 
of a foreign nations 
government would be 
bad enough in any 
case; to do so now
would be incomprehensible.
The administrations practice of funding the 
insurgents is on questionable ground. While 
he Sandinistas have been far from a model 
government, there is no question that they are 
better than the Samoza dictatorship they reInquiring Minds Eavesdrop on Presidential Predictions
Mv THE INQUIRING STAFF
Last week we were hard up for a story and 
started searching garbage. Well this week was 
just as bad. Then we were sitting in Scotland 
Yard late Thursday night and heard two people 
talking over Jolt Co
las. Feverishly, we 
took out our notepads 
and recorded what 
they said. Sure hope 
they wont sue us!
Biden had to drop out because he didnt 
credit one paragraph? Jeez, imagine if I run for 
President. Theyll have a field day.
I dont think you have too much to worry 
about; whod vote for a Carnegie Mellon 
graduate? I wouldntwould you? How 
many people are left running anyway?
Im not sure. USA Today had the chart on 
' them yesterday, but I guess its pretty much off 
by now. Lets see, Kennedy dropped 
out...when...in 1985? It makes sense; he never 
wouldve been able to hide Chappaquiddik for 
very long, anyway.
Yeah, I remember. They said that Hart and 
Cuomo would fight it out for the nomination. 
But Mario isnt running. Shame; he gives 
the best speeches, and Matilda would make 
"such a nice First Lady.
And it was a shame what they did to Gary. 
Hell, at least hes got good taste in women. I 
wouldnt want to elect anyone who sleeps 
every night with Tipper Gore.
Aw, you dont have to worry about that. 
Didnt you hear? She filed for divorce today. 
Seems that she found a Motley Crue fan club 
card in Als wallet.
- No kidding!
No one really knows these people. Like that 
Simon guytook me three weeks to figure out 
why Les Nessman was running for President! 
Ok, I see your point. Whod have believed 
that George Bush would get drunk at a Shriners dinner and admit that he rents his person
ality from Walter Mondale?
And then theres Jesse I was there when 
Martin bit the big one Jackson. How much 
mileage can you get out of standing next to 
someone when he gets shot?
I like that Babbitt guy. You never hear any
thing about him.
Who?
Never mind. I dont like Robertson though. 
I dont mind that he got out of fighting in 
Korea, but when he wanted a purple heart for 
paper cuts back at HQ...I dont know.
At least weve got Dole. You think Bob can 
handle being the first male First Lady?
At that point, Letterman started doing Stupid 
Pet Tricks. We thought that an iguana doing 
cartwheels through the Prancing Fluids was a 
lot more interesting than the 88 campaign. 
Which is funnier though, were not sure.

placed. They were democratically elected, 
they have increased literacy, and they have 
redistributed the land held by Samozas syco
phants. Recently they have imposed censor
ship and repressed political opponents. This is 
unacceptable, but it was also unacceptable 
under Samoza, whose regime the United 
States supported. The real motivation for the 
Administrations actions is not what the 
Sandinistas do now or might do in the future,- 
it is ideological: Nicaragua elected a socialist 
government, loosely allied with the USSR, 
and it just wont do.
Important things have been happening in 
Central America. President Oscar Arias of 
Costa Rica has persuaded Central American 
leaders to adopt a plan which, if successful,
promises to give the area peace and stability. 
By Nov. 7, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guate
mala, Honduras and Costa Rica must join 
together in proclaiming cease fires, granting 
full freedom to the press, and removing re
strictions on opposition political parties. 
These requirements are aimed chiefly at Nica
ragua and El Salvador.
Already, Nicaragua has announced a partial 
cease fire, given the chief opposition newspa
per La Prensa and the Roman Catholic radio 
station permission to resume operation, al
lowed the return of an exiled political leader, 
and, in a surprising reversal, started to talk 
about the possibility of negotiating with the 
Contras. The Reagan administration calls 
these moves cosmetic gestures of compliFeel Better: Get Involved
By ERIC WITTLE
Last week, I wrote about student commit
ment to Quality of Life, or rather the lack 
thereof. I really expected that the issue would 
affect some students enough that I would get a 
reply. Imagine my 
surprise to go through 
an entire week with
out any response 
whatsoever.
Granted, response to my previous columns 
could not be called overwhelming, but it was 
there. I hoped that speaking about student 
commitment would be controversial enough 
to generate more response. There are several 
possible explanations for this lack of response, 
but I believe the most probable is apathy.
Face the facts! If you truly want a better 
Quality of Life, youre going to have to put in 
some effort. You are either going to have to 
spend some time communicating with people 
who can accomplish changes in CMU (my 
preference), or use some alternative method 
such as demonstrating, civil disobedience, etc. 
(the preference of some of my friends).
At this point, my personal preference would 
be to vent some of the bitterness, anger, and 
frustration I feel about the student bodys 
effort towards improving the Quality of Life. 
However, this has been done before by differ
ent people, with almost no effect. Instead, Im 
asking you to spend some time looking beyond 
the exams you have this week, and beyond 
your party plans for this weekend. Think about
next month, next semester, or next year.
Isnt there something that you would appre
ciate being able to do then that you couldnt do 
now? Or something that you had to do now that 
youll hate doing again later? If you make the 
effort to do something about your concern, I 
guarantee that youll get something in return.
The students that I know and work with, who 
put in time to improve everyones Quality of 
Life, are mostly happier and healthier than 
other students. I think that this is because 
students who make an effort feel the positive 
returns from communicating their concerns, 
and having someone listen.
Part of the reason to make an effort to im
prove everyones Quality of Life is not just 
altruism. There is a special feeling that you get 
when you know that youve made a difference 
in someones life, that you cant get any other 
way. It makes you feel better about yourself, as 
well as better about the world.
Enough of sweetness and light. Go out and 
do somethinganything to make your con
cerns known. Id even enjoy it if your effort 
was to drop me a note saying that this column 
sucks, as long as you tell me why.
One more time, for the record, I can be 
reached through the SDC office (x2114), 
through campus mail (Box 576), and through 
electronic mail (ewlk@tb).

President of the Student Dormitory Council,

ance and a sham. Its difficult to see how this 
could be so. Sandinista leaders may not be 
good republicans, but they are not stupid. If 
they do not intend to comply fully with the 
Arias plan by the Nov. 7 deadline, then they 
are making a very grave mistake. By making 
the substantial move of freeing the opposition 
press, the Sandinistas admit that closing the 
press in the first place was wrong, and they 
create an expectation of more change; not an 
expectation of some increase in glasnost 
some time in the future, but of full freedom of 
the press, on Nov. 7.
If its difficult to see what internal purpose 
these gestures serve, it is impossible to 
support a claim that these changes are ges
tures designed to discourage congressional 
support for the Contras. Even if Congress 
grants the $270M, there is no prospect of a 
Contra victory. The majority of Contra targets 
are military only in that they are defended and 
represent a demoralizing, rather than a threat
ening loss. Nor is the Sandinista government 
going to win if the furltiing isnt granted. The 
Contras have just received $3.5M in interim 
aid, and, in any case, have more than enough 
weaponry to last till the deadline. If the 
Sandinistas do not meet that deadline, then 
they can be sure that the Contras will receive 
a blank cheque in the next budget.
Giving the money to the Contras now would 
be a slap in the face for Arias and for the 
Central American leaders who are risking 
much by following his plan. It would make it 
perfectly clear that the Administration ex
pects, or even wants, the Arias plan to fail. It 
leads one to suspect that, even when the 
Sandinistas restore full press freedom, stop 
shooting at Contras, and announce elections, 
the Administration will continue its attempts 
at destabilization.
It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that 
Reagans request for money is motivated more 
by emotionalism than by reason. He was 
emotionally unable to abandon hostages in the 
middle east, even when the futile rescue plan 
meant giving weapons to the palpably evil 
Iranian government. He is unwilling to aban
don the Contras, men and women he de
scribes as the moral equivalent of the found
ing fathers, even if it means throwing away 
the only hope of peace in the region.

Learn How to Think: Become a Student of Student Pugwash
By JENNISEVERATartan Staffer iter
Whats a Pugwash, you ask?
No, the definition of Pugwash isnt the 
Tartan stupid question of the week, or even 
the act of washing a Pug. Student Pugwash 
is a national organization, formed several 
years ago, to promote well- informed and 
value-conscious decision making about 
science and technology among students. 
And we have a hew chapter of-Student 
Pugwash here at Carnegie Mellon this year.
It isnt as bad as itsounds.
Student Pugwash is named after a town in 
Nova Scotia where Einstein, Bertrand 
Russell, and other world scientists met after 
World War II to appraise the perils that 
have arisen as a result of the development of 
weapons of mass destruction (taken from 
the Pugwash Manifesto written up as a 
result of the conference).
But Student Pugwash is not a nuclear ac
tivist group. It was created to aid in in
formed decision-making for various sci
ence and technology issues in todays soci
ety. Student Pugwash does this by sponsor
ing seminars in which guest speakers offer 
discussion on multiple sides and aspects of 
an issue.
Take that Diet Coke youre sipping. Was 
it ethical for the FDA to put NutraSweet on 
the market when research on its safety isnt 
yet complete? Did the benefits outweigh 
the risk? Were you even aware that this was 
the case?
On a more technical note, what about ge
netic engineering? Is it ethical? What will 
its effects be on the human race?
These are just some of the issues that 
Student Pugwash can deal with. You dont 
have to be a science major to be concerned 
about genetic engineering or Nu
traSweetthese are issues that can affect 
everyone.
And everyone, whether an engineer or an 
English major, is welcome at a Pugwash
STUDENT
PUGWASH
seminar.
Student Pugwash will hold its first semi
nar on October 20 from 4:00-6:00pm 
(place to be announced). The seminar is 
entitled, The Future of Undergraduate 
Education and will have as speakers 
Stephen Fienberg (Dean of H&SS), Lin
coln Wolfenstein (Dept, of Physics), and 
Clark Glymour (Dept, of Philosophy). The 
main issue to be discussed deals with the 
value of humanities courses for science and 
technology majors and vice versa. In addi
tion, Student Pugwash will have a table at 
the T.O.C on October 1.
In this technological age, its been said, 
We have to learn to think in a new way. 
I think, however, that it is more appropriate 
to say that We have to learn how to 
thinkto think about what were doing, 
why were doing it, and what consequences 
may result. Student Pugwash offers just 
that opportunity.
Here s the trick, to...Roommate Revenge!
Ace Offers Advice 
on Avoiding Assault
By BOB GLICKSTEIN
Tartan Staffwriter
True: At three oclock on the morning of 
Sunday, September thirteenth, I, your humble 
reporter, was assaulted and beaten by a gang of 
racially motivated youths.
How embarrassing.
Fret Not: your humble reporter escaped with 
only a few minor injuries from which he has 
now largely recovered. But this accident 
caused me to think about you, my loyal read
ers. How could my experience help you avoid 
such an ordeal?
After a few days of thought and consultation 
with the local Pittsburgh Police, I have com
piled this list of tips on How to Avoid Being 
Assaulted and Beaten by a Gang of Racially 
Motivated Youth^.
Number One: Never, ever go out. Instead, 
lock your doors and windows and hide under 
the bed.
Excuse me, my editor just tapped me on the 
shoulder. Ill be back in a minute.
I cant believe it. Im supposed to re-evaluate my list of tips. Hunh. Im sitting here, 
composing a helpful article for my loyal read
ers taken from personal experience and along 
comes the editor, peering over my shoulder at 
my notes and has the gall to tell me that my tips 
cul led from personal experience have to be reevaluated! Well, fine.
Tip number one: Always get home by sun
down. This is most important. As most of you 
know, the large majority of assaults, beatings.
This week Spectacles will highlight a popular 
pastime here at Carnegie Mellon. Some stu
dents while away the hours juggling in Gray 
Matter, playing video games, or simply toying 
around in the UCC. But the majority seem to
and crimes in general take place at night, in 
the dark. I was never quite sure why this is. 
If I were to commit an assault, beating, or 
crime in general, I would do it in daylight, so
I could see better who it was I was assaulting 
or beating or committing a general crime 
upon (...general crime to? ...general crime 
at? ...general crime for?). Anyway, if you 
always get home by sundown, your chances 
of encountering violent crime may go way, 
way down (I would quote figures here, but I 
have absolutely no idea what they are or how 
to get them). I cant stress this enough. Oh, 
wait; yes I can. I have an italicskey. Alw ays 
get home by sundown.
Tip number two: The police are not here to 
protect you. They are here to make you feel 
like youre doing something important for 
the community when you report a violent 
crime perpetrated by really big scary guys 
who if theyre actually caught will probably 
be released and then come to hunt you down 
and ruin your clothes and body with some
thing sharp. After youve fulfilled this task, 
the police are also here to tell you to wait 
outside your apartment building at four in the 
morning so that they can send a car to take a 
report and so that while youre waiting you 11 
probably get beaten up by another gang. 
Finally, the police are also here to make yo4u 
wait a full hour for a car to come to take a 
report, by which time the bad guys are half 
way to Tijuana, and when the car comes, the 
continued on page 13
prefer to spend their time plotting and scheming.
Tables at Morewood and Kiltie are filled with 
undergraduates discussing their roommates. 
Airing the personal hygiene habits of your 
roommate is the number two most talked about 
topic. The number one topic is what the speaker 
has done or will do to the roommate in question.
The more mild-mannered are content with 
simple federal offenses. Opening mail, inter
cepting phone calls and blatantly eavesdropping 
are activities that are dismissed as old hat. On a 
slightly racier level are the felons and thieves. 
They prefer to take items belonging to their 
roommates and relocate them. Some use laun
dry tokens which they did not purchase, others 
sabotage change, food, soap, and clothes: 
sooner or later most of these things mysteriously 
disappear.
Catching a glimpse of your sweater as it boldly 
saunters through the library is just a minor heart 
murmur compared to the coronary you would 
experience if you had a roommate who out
weighed you by 125 lbs. Seeing your clothes on 
campus is an advantage. Seeing them off cam
pus is a disadvantage.
Jane Doe remembers walking into the movie 
theatre in Squirrel Hill and seeing her favorite 
skirt pinned up on the wall behind the popcorn 
cup display. A sign read: Lost and Found, 
Center Aisle, The Untouchables. She de
manded it back from the usher, plots brewing in 
her head of revenge-oriented maneuvers. She 
was so wrapped up in her scheming that when 
her date expressed his qualms about how her 
skirt managed to find itself on the floor of the 
theatre during the 6:20 show of the previous 
evening, she did not answer. She then found 
herself without her date in the theatre; skirt 
clenched firmly in hand, brow knitted in con
sternation.
While this might never have happened to you, 
you are undoubtedly familiar with the feeling of 
revenge Ms. Doe experienced. Your roommate 
has taken something of yours, and you want 
something of equal or greater value. This some
times appears impossible. The pin your high 
school sweetheart gave you at the prom is now 
holding together the handle of your roommates 
umbrella. If that blatant disregard of sentiment 
werent bad enough, the fact that two broken 
spokes on this umbrella has kept it immobilized 
on the closet floor for three months will. Of 
course if you were, by chance, to move the CS W 
notebook, boot with missing heel and empty
Doritos bag, you would come across your most 
cherished possession, but chances are you 
won  t. Not knowing that this pin is in the closet 
and after having looked for it for eleven to 
fourteen hours you then come to the conclusion 
that your roommate is a thief. Not only did she 
obviously steal your pin, she probably is an
gling for your old sweetheart too.
Of course the only option open to you now is 
The Trick. The procedure is simple. Run to 
your next meal. Premise your topic of discus
sion with a familiar attention getting cliche, 
e.g., I dont want to talk about it, but... Swear 
you wont tell anyone...Youll never believe 
this... Hopefully your roommate will be eat
ing with his/her friends and you can employ 
visual aid. Dont look now buttheresol Miss 
five-finger-discount herself. With enough 
emphasis, everyone at the table will swivel in 
their seats. They hope to catch a glimpse of the 
roommate that makes one long for capital 
punishment to be passed by Student Senate. 
The next step is called Awareness Day. If 
your friends dont know about the unusual and 
unattractive things the roommate does, tell 
them. Tell them anyway and be sure to include 
endless detail of how-sick-it-was. Then, 
before attention lags tell them of the latest 
offense. Your part of conversational naviga
tion is over now. Everyone at the table will 
breathlessly share their personal experiences 
with roommates weirder, uglier, stranger, and 
more revolting than yours. Then suggestions 
will fly.
Here are a few we collected in the field that 
promise to be effective for getting some re
venge on that roommate. The prank is geared 
towards the crime.
Crime: laundry token theft, soap use, or 
detergent hiding 
Prank: short sheet bed, spill coffee, or put on 
roommate's boyfriends sweatshirtits the 
one she only takes off to take a shower.
Crime: borrowing last pair of socks or run
ning your only black stockings 
Prank: peach pit in pocket of cardigan, break 
one of the laces on sneakers 
Crime: not telling you someone called 
Prank: tell him/her someone called who 
didnt, and insist they wanted them to return the 
call no matter what time
Crime: eating cookies you had saved for a 
special occasion, or borrowing a favorite gar
ment
Prank: Sun In in their shampoo bottle, 
ammonia in their tissue box, moving the time 
on their alarm clock up fifteen minutes 
After you deny having committed these of
fenses, proceed with caution. Undoubtedly 
another one of your roommate's unusual idio
syncrasies will surface soon. This will not only 
keep your friends entertained at lunch, it will 
also make you realize just how much you 
missed the old loser over the summer and why 
she or he doesnt REALLY know everything 
about you.

Dining vs. Eating: Observations on UDS
By HOWDY PIERCE
Tartan Staffwriter 
Just the other day I was in the Tartan Grill. 
The guy at the register was just giving my i.d.
card back to me. Enjoy your meal, he said. 
Honest! I am probably the only CMU student 
in history who has heard those three words at 
the Tartan Grill.
Im going to let you in on a staff secret. 
Ready? There is no real substance to the 
Features Section this week. Why else would 
we run an article on the dining service? But
Mary, my editor, insisted. So, grumbling, I set 
out to shed some new light on a much-illumi
nated subject  what and where we eat.
For those fellow freshmen out there, food at 
Carnegie Mellon is prepared by an entity 
known as University Dining Service, which 
is a contradiction of terms. Lets not mince 
words: At this university, you dont dine, you 
eat. After trying so hard to fool prospective stu
dents about our food by tacking a euphemism 
on the food people, someone blew it. The 
acronym for University Dining Service is
UDS. If you pronounce it as in the plural for 
ud, you have a good term to describe the 
feeling you get after just one meal at the 
Tartan Grill. I have a very important question. 
In Kiltie Cafe, there is a row of green columns 
located perhaps twenty feet inside the win
dows. Each column has a black band about six 
feet off the ground. Why? I asked some 
people. Freshman Jan Mullet said that the 
black stuff is probably electrical tape they use 
to hold the place together. Sophomore 
Sharon Becker had a better idea. Those are
bumper guards for all the flying objects. 
Flying objects? Come on, people, lets try to 
refrain from throwing our plates across the 
cafeteria.
The Tartan Grill also has some odd design 
features. In the wall which is directly opposite 
the counter area, there are several large holes 
about ten feet in diameter. Now, I understand 
that these holes are there to create the illusion 
of space. It also strikes me that they make great 
windows, so you can see who is coming in

Sick, unhappyP or just plain bored?Make It Well Month Might Help
By NATALIE PETERSON
Tartan Staffer iter 
Does it seem as though you always have ten 
different things to do all at once? Has living on 
pizza and Jolt Cola finally begun to take its 
toll? Do not despair, a solution to your prob
lems may be less than a week away! Through
out October, various groups around campus 
will be sponsoring health and fitness related 
activities. The programs are being offered in 
conjunction with Making It Well, the theme 
for the month of October according to a calen
der produced by Student Affairs, Alumni 
Relations, and Housing. A few samples from 
the October calendar include programs con
cerning relaxation, human sexuality, and eat
ing disorders, as well as the more physically 
oriented aerobic classes and Homecoming 5K 
Race.
Each month Student Affairs, Alumni Rela
tions, and Housing, will be producing a similar 
calendar of events relating to a specific theme. 
Examples of future themes include: Making 
it Safe (Sexuality, Sexually Transmitted
Diseases-Aids Forum), Make-Over (Per
sonal Improvement, Resolutions), Making it 
Fun (Play, Hobbies, Relaxation), and Mak
ing it Through Conflicts (Saying goodbye, 
Finishing, Letting it go, Starting again). Stu
dent Affairs, Alumni Relations, and Housing 
are not sponsoring every event on the calen
dars. Rather, they will simply be coordinating 
publicity for any programs relating to the 
designated monthly themes.
Assistant Dean for Student Affairs, Ed Lilley 
claims that the idea for coordinating a themerelated calendar of events has been in the 
making for a couple of years. According to 
Lilley, Many really good programs were 
simply not getting enough attendance. It was 
decided that if events were more clustered 
together they would be more difficult to miss. 
Lilley feels that the overall goal of the project 
is to create some momentum on campus 
around some important topics. He hopes that 
eventually people will be able to plan events 
such as debates and lectures according to the 
themes.

I was thinking how I 'ddescribe the food here

about the food. His tour guide has already told

CMU food is not moms home cooking but is 
very good. Tell the truth. Did you hear this

Thompson also was a tough out for me,

After the 1985 season, Stuper called it 
quits, and went home to Butler. His only 
regrets are that he misses his friends and 
the money, but has nothing but good 
things to say about the Cardinals and his 
career. He is now working on his

Tennis Team Defeated By Rain
By NEAL A. LEVENE
Tartan Staffwriter
Yet another womens tennis match was can
celed due to rain this Thursday. With only four 
of the singles matches completed against a 
much improved Washington and Jefferson 
Women's Tennis Team, Pittsburgh weather 
struck again postponing a seemingly easy win 
for the Lady Tartans until a date to be an
nounced later. Carnegie Mellon was ahead of 
the First Ladies 3-1 before the downpour 
forced play to stop. Lady Tartan wins came 
from Beth Cavanaugh, Tracy Boyd, and Alice 
Garber.
This is the fourth consecutive tennis match 
that has been cancelled due to inclement

weather. So far this season, California Univer
sity of Pennsylvania, Hiram College, Grove 
City College, and now Washington & Jeffer
son have all had to cancel and reschedule 
matches.
After moving up from number three to 
number two singles this week, Beth Cava
naugh easily defeated her opponent in a 6-2,6-
0 match. Cavanaugh commented, Im much 
happier at number two. It seems like I played 
much better today. Cavanaugh moved up 
from number three after beating Andrea 
Benowitz last week. Benowitz moved down 
to number three.
Unfortunately, Benowitz did not have much 
luck at number three where she lost to her 
opponent Alicia Anderson 4-6, 2-6. After her 
match, she commented, I know Im a good 
player. It just seems like I havent been able to 
put my game together this year. I know I 
would have won that match had I been 
healthy. Benowitz played the match suffer
ing from a cold.
The other two victories came from Alice 
Garber playing her first match at number six. 
She won her match decisively 6-2,6-0. Tracy 
Boyd also won her match at number five, 
winning 6-1, 6-1.
There were two singles matches interrupted 
by the rain. Number one singles player Suzy 
Dottor had split the first two sets with her op
ponent when the rain started. She seemed to be 
having difficulty in the third set and was thank
ful for the rain. Amy Fibuss number four 
singles match was interrupted as well.
The tennis teams next match is not until 
Saturday. They will be taking on cross-town 
rival Robert Morris College at the Tech Courts 
at 1:00 pm, assuming of course that weather 
permits.

Penguins Pre-Season Prep Begins
By JOHN FRIEDMANN
Tartan Contributing Editor 
You may not have noticed it because of the 
weather, or because the Pirates are playing so 
well, or because the Steelers are not playing at 
all, but hockey season is here.
The Penguins opened training camp on Sept%nber 11 with a number of changes, includ
ing a new coach, Pierre Creamer. Creamer 
(pronounced 
Kray-mer) comes 
from Sherbrooke 
of the American 
Hockey League, 
where he won the 
league champion
ship in 1986 and 
lost in the finals in 
1987. Chosen by 
GM Eddie
Johnston as much 
for his people 
skills as his 
coaching talents,
Creamer will try to 
till a winning 
desire in his play
ers, something for
mer coach Bob Berry was unable to do.

Lemieux may just be happy that he finally has
a competent winger at his side. Off-season 
help arrived in the form of right winger Wilf 
Paiment. The 31 year-old scored 20 goals last 
season for the Buffalo Sabres, and is a proven 
winger who can both assist and protect (6T\ 
210 pounds) the gifted center.
Bob Errey may have simplified the search for 
a left wing. In the Pens first exhibition game 
a week ago, Errey recorded two of 
Pittsburghs three 
goals, both with feeds 
from Lemieux. 
Creamer will try other 
combinations, and al
most anyone could 
end up on the line. A 
winger fighting for 
his job is Dwight 
Mathiesen, signed out 
of the University of 
Denver at the end of 
the 1985-6 season. 
Despite his highly 
touted potential, the 
right wingers lethar
gic attitude earned 
him a quick trip to 
Baltimore last season. 
This is a make-or-break camp for Mathiesen.

fenseman, away from the Olympic team for 
two months. He will play in the first eightregular season games, and return after the 
Olympics in February. Another promising 
young defenseman is Chris Joseph, who 
played in the Western Hockey League last 
season. Joseph is only 18, and will likely spend 
another season in junior hockey.
An area of concern is the goaltending. GM 
Eddie Johnson has been trying all summer to 
pry Andy Moog, who has demanded a trade, 
from the Edmonton Oilers. But the Oilers want 
draft choices, Doug Bodger, or center Craig 
Simpson in return. While it is unlikely that 
Bodger will depart to the paucity of quality
blueliners in Pittsburgh, Simpson could well 
walk. With Lemieux as the first line center, Pat 
Quinn as the second, Dave Mcllwain on the 
checking line, Simpson is without a job.
Current netminders are Pat Riggin, acquired 
from Boston last spring, and Steve Guenette, 
who played for AHL affiliate Baltimore last 
season. Veteran Gilles Meloche is out for 
several weeks with a knee injury, but will 
likely bump one of the above when he returns.
The Penguins return to Pittsburgh on October 
2 when they take on Montreal in their final 
exhibition game. They will open the regular 
season October 8 in New York, and will open 
at home on October 12 versus the Sabres.

John Stuper: From Butler to the World Series
By PERRY PIERCE
Tartan Staffwriter
When the Carnegie Mellon Baseball Club 
played Butler Community College recently, 
everyone playing baseball between the foul 
lines had dreams of playing for the World 
Championship. But one person on the side
lines had lived those fantasies for real. John 
Stuper, a graduate of Butler Community Col
lege and now coach of the Pioneers, spent 7 
hard years working to make his dream of 
pitching in the World Series a reality.
Stuper graduated from Butler High School in 
1975, and moved on to Butler Community 
College. There he was a standout in baseball 
and basketball, and when his time was up at the 
2-year school, he moved on to Point Park 
College. At Point Park he tuned his pitching 
skills, and was drafted by the Pittsburgh Pi
rates in the eighteenth round of the 1978 draft. 
Stuper, at 62" 200 lbs, was a good right
handed pitching prospect because of his size. 
I relied on a fastball, a hard breaking slider, 
and a curve ball. It was a real thrill being

But after his baseball eligibility was over at 
Point Park,he still wanted a degree. His first 
pro year, he was taking classes at LaRoche to 
finish up his undergraduate work in English. 
So in the spring, he went to training camp with 
the team while taking classes at the same time. 
There were times when I had to type papers at 
camp and send them to school. It was a real 
hassle, but I finally got my degree.
In 1978, three months after being drafted, 
Stuper received notice that he was traded from 
the Pirates to the St. Louis Cardinals for Tom 
Sandt, the current first base coach for the 
Pittsburgh Pirates. It wasnt a trade that 
stopped the baseball world, as Stuper was only
a Class A ballplayer at the time.
He worked hard for 3 years in the minors, but 
in 1982, he finally saw the light at the end of 
the tunnel. He started the year 7-1 with the 
Louisville Cardinals, St. Louis triple A farm 
club. Then on May 28, 1982, Stuper got the 
call to join the Cardinals in St. Louis. When 
I arrived, I was very excited, but had to contain 
myself...I looked around and saw all the guys 
that I watched play on TV, but I couldnt be in 
awe of them. It was my job to get them all out. 
What made it a little more manageable was 
that I had spent a good part of spring training 
with the Cards the two previous years.
His first major league start came on June 1, 
1982, versus the San Fransisco Giants. In that 
game Stuper went eight innings, allowed three 
earned runs on five hits and two walks, and got 
a no-decision. I pitched a good game that 
night, but not a great one. Of course I was 
nervous, but I did get a triple that helped me get
the no-decision.
Stuper went 9-7 for St. Louis in 1982, but 
more importantly, the Cardinals won 92 
games and the National League Pennant. John 
was scheduled to start game 2 of the series 
against the Milwaukee Brewers, but was not 
too overwhelmed by the pressure he face^. 
Most of the tension was eased as he charted 
pitches for game 1 of the series. We lost that 
game 10-1, and the first two guys in the lineup, 
Paul Molitor and Robin Yount, had nine hits in 
the game. Seeing how they hit in that first 
game, I wasnt as nervous when I got out to 
start game two. The first three hitters in the 
Brewers lineup that year had 200 hits each. 
Stuper always thrived on the pressure of th^ 
big game. But after his team had been rocked 
10-1 the night before, he was not as keyed up 
as he normally was for such a big start. I 
really wasnt that nervous for the game. I liked 
being nervous when I pitched, because it 
helped me work faster. Stuper only lasted 
four innings in his first World Series start, 
yielding four runs and getting a no-decision.
The Cardinals were having a tough series, 
and Whitey Herzog, the Cardinals managed, 
gave the ball to Stuper for game six. The 
Cardinals were behind three games to two, and 
found themselves backed against the wall. 
Stuper definitely felt pressure as he went out to 
the pitcher's mound, because this time the se
ries rested on his arm. I was more nervous for 
that game than I have ever been in my life. 
More nervous than my first kiss, my first 
date...nervousness also helped me pitch fasted. 
But I had never pitched quicker than I did that 
night. I was pitching so fast that the hitters 
were stepping out all the time to try and slow 
me down.
The Cardinals responded to his pitching 
performance, as they trounced the Brewers 13- 
1, as Stuper went all the way on a four hitter. 
That was by far the best pitching performance 
of my life. The Cards went on to win gam 
seven and take the Series four games to three. 
Winning it all was the biggest thrill. I got a 
little bit of money, but I got the ring.
Most of Stupers high praises for the Cardinal 
organization are directed toward theirmanager, Whitey Herzog. Whitey is by far the 
smartest man in baseball. He is constantly 
three or four innings ahead of the game be
tween the white lines, playing out scenarios ( " 
pitching matchups in the later innings. The 
Cardinals were a great team (in 1982), but 
Whitey made us all that much better.
Stuper also thinks very highly of what the 
Cardinals have assembled in the defensive 
department. Ozzie Smith is by far, the most 
dominating defensive player in baseball. He 
will get his seventy or so RBIs a year, but he 
will save your team over 100 runs with h: 
defense. If you look at it, he alone is putting 
175 runs a year into your pocket. I cant count 
how many times he saved me from taking a 
loss.
The 1982 season proved to be Stupers best 
year. In 1984, he developed shoulder prob
lems and was only 3-5. In 1985, he was 
involved in a trade that sent him to Cincinnatti 
for Bill Gullickson. With the Reds he was 8 t 
5, with a 4.55 ERA in 13 starts and 20 appear
ances from the bull pen. After struggling, the 
Reds released him in the middle of the season, 
and he was picked up by the Montreal Expos. 
Although on the roster, he never threw another 
pitch in the big leagues. No one wanted me. 
Everyone in the front offices kept saying that 
they had people just as talented as me, but they 
were only getting paid minimum salary. M 
contract was just too big.

PHI Player of the Game, freshman fullback Fran Bellante lays a block on Duquesne's Gary

By STEWART LEVINE
Tartan Sports Editor 
Fran Bellante is no stranger to South High 
Stadium. He played many games in there in 
the blue and gold uniforms of the Central 
^Catholic Vikings.
However, Saturdays game there was a new 
experience for him. He was again playing 
there, again starting there, but this time he was 
in the red and white uniform of the Carnegie 
Mellon Tartans.
Bellante admits that it felt a little strange. 
We were in the visitors locker room, and the 
game seemed a little harder and faster.
The Tartans emphasize the running game 
with their wing-I offense. Said Bellante, It 
was a.pressure situation, fullback is impor
tant. In any case, in his first Tartan start, he 
responded to the newness and pressure well. 
Bellante rushed for 66 yards on 12 carries, 
second on the team to quarterback Mike 
Hensel. That effort earned him PHI Player of 
the Game honors.

Freshman Jessica Caplan was the top Tartan 
finisher, placing eleventh overall with a time
chart at fullback. However, in the opener 
against Allegheny, starter Chris Hansen went 
down with a knee injury. The following week, 
backup Eric Polkis injured his foot, thrusting 
Bellante into the starting role.
The week of practice before the Duquesne 
game was much tougher than the previous 
weeks. Were only down to two fullbacks, it 
was a lot harder week, commented Bellante. 
However, he wasnt going it alone. Everyone 
was a big help, he went on.
Bellante didnt receive the ball until the 
Tartans second drive in the first quarter, 
going up the middle for a gain of three yards. 
He was just a bit nervous before he got the call, 
I had butterflies in the beginning, youve just 
got to concentrate.
Bellante only got the ball two more times in 
the first half. But in the second half, he took the 
ball nine more times. I was getting some 
pretty big holes. We were running a lot of 
plays off-tackle. His best efforts came late in 
third quarter with rushes for eighteen and 
fifteen yards that set up the Tartans go ahead
of 20:15. Sophomore Sue Johnson was the 
next Lady Tartan across the line finishing 16th 
overall with a time of 20:37. Pat Fall, Sue 
Sparks, Kelly Shannon, and Rachel Nobel 
rounded off the finishers for CMU.

overall. Fall and Kristin Burgard were the 
next two Tartans to finish, both with the time 
of 17:53, and tenth and eleventh place overall.

the Tartans with a time of 19:00 and 16th

Volleyball Squad 
Blanked By Grove 
City, Allegheny
By NATALIE HAWRYLUK
Tartan Staffer iter
Earlier in the week, the Lady Tartans 
travelled to Grove City, where they 
were defeated by last years Presidents 
Athletic Conference champion Grove 
City College 2-0 and non-conference 
opponent Allegheny College 2-0.
In the first match against the Lady 
Wolverines, Carnegie Mellon used 
three different setters, but the Lady 
Tartans were only able to muster ten 
kills while they massed nine hitting er
rors. Nobody put the ball away, said 
Head Coach Sue Flaherty. Defensively, 
the team made 25 receiving errors.
During the match against Lady Gators, 
the Lady Tartans played more defense, 
at the expense of more offense. The 
team committed only fifteen receiving 
errors, but ten hitting errors left their 
number of kills at only six for the match.
Coach Flaherty commented on the 
youth and relative inexperience of col
lege-level volleyball of her players, 
noting that over half the team are under
classmen. We are improving every day 
at practice. We just have to work on 
confidence and teamwork. The team
work will come together as soon as 
Monica Zalevsky and Chris Mauro are 
able to return to the starting lineup.

It was a close but sweet victory in two ways 
for the mens cross-country team Saturday in 
Schenley Park. Th Tartans managed to out
run the Robert Morris Colonials, 24-35. f
The Colonials have caused much contro
versy in recent weeks with reports of their 
runners cutting the courses short, thus being 
disqualified from several meets. Tartan Head 
Coach Gary Meckley was prepared to see that 
the race was on the up-and-up. To ensure a fair 
race, Meckley had spotters at key intersections 
and turn-arounds throughout the course.
The victory also had a special significane^ - 
for Meckley. Not only was it his 89th consecu
tive dual meet victory, it was his 200th as a 
coach at Carnegie Mellon.
The Colonials threatened the Tartans with 
their top runner, Aling, taking first place with 
the time of 25:53. Fortunately for CMU, they 
did not have the depth of strong runners that 
the Tartans had. Keith Stopen, Pat Noll, and 
Paul Camine took the next three places for th* 
Tartans. Gary Meiker and Kevin Helm came 
in seventh and eighth to seal the victory.
Pat Noll and Paul Camine both had impres
sive finishes to their races. At the two mile 
marker Noll and Camine were fifth and sixth, 
ASpBSK.0GSU1; g. .S AgKSJp SEC .S1 i0E0pSC 
third and fourth. In doing this, they knocked a 
Robert Morris runner from third to fifth place; 
this was a key factor in the Tartans victory, r
Keith Stopen did not have the strong finish 
that Aling from Robert Morris had. The two 
were stride for stride with each other at the two 
mile marker; Stopen even had a slight lead at 
the return trip past the marker. As the two 
leaders came out of the woods for the final lap 
around Flagstaff, Stopen was only some 4-5 
seconds behind. Aling then kicked into high 
gear and finished well ahead of Stopen.

Duquesne on Saturday night.Field Hockey Team Defeats 
Bethany In Double Overtime
By JOHN FRIEDMANN
Tartan Contributing Editor 
The Tartans had come to South Stadium 
looking for their first big win of the season at 
the expense of a supposedly weak Duquesne 
team.
It didn't happen. Instead, what they got was 
an intense, penalty filled battle marked by bad 
feelings and extra-curricular hits on both 
sides.
There is no love lost between the two teams, 
each of whom resents the others style of play 
and attitude. For most of the game, the emotion 
of the Duquesne Dukes looked like it would 
triumph over the cool intensity of Carnegie 
Mellon.
But the Tartans were able to invoke their now 
familiar fourth quarter magic and mixed it 
with Duquesne panic for a 17-13 comeback 
victory.
Duquesne had pulled into a 13-10 lead with 
a 37-yard Doug McAuley field goal late in the 
thirdquarter. The Dukes turned the ball overto 
a Carnegie Mellon offense that had sputtered 
so far in the second half.
Mike Beresford provided a jump start to the 
Tartan offense by returning the kickoff 23 
yards to the 38. PHI Player of the Game, 
freshman fullback Fran Bellante took over and 
blew through the line for two outstanding 
power runs, putting the ball at the Duquesne 
29. Bellante, who gained 63 of his 66 yards 
rushing in the second half, just barrelled ahead 
with his 5'8", 220 pound body trying to find or 
make a hole.
Liking what they saw, Carnegie Mellon kept 
to the ground and punched the ball in with a 
series of rollouts and keepers. Mike Hensels 
five yard touchdown run with 11:56 left in the 
game put Carnegie Mellon in the lead for 
good.
ATO Snaps 
Pika's Win 
Streak
By STEWART LEVINE
Tartan Sports Editor 
After five years of victories, the Pika 
majors IM team didnt know how to 
lose anymore. That was until ATO 
taught them how in a 20-19 upset last 
week.
With two seconds left, ATO quarter
back Chris Koschofound center Gary 
Como in the end zone for the winning 
strike.
Pika jumped out to an early 13-0 lead 
with freshman quarterback Mike Reed 
firing two touchdown strikes to center 
Steve Krom. However, ATO battled 
back on touchdown passes from Koscho 
to Zach Oxman and Mike Nazzarro. 
Pika's Reed later found Evan Kaliner 
with a thirty yard touchdown pass to go 
ahead 19-14.
Although most of the fourth quarter re
mained, Duquesne abandoned the running 
tandem of Sean McDonough, Tom Celadonia 
and Jamie Colosimo that had served them so 
well through the first three quarters. The 
Dukes ran the ball only twice in the final 
frame, instead trying to move the ball quickly 
through the air.
The Tartan defense, which allowed 200 
ground yards through three quarters, delighted 
in the change and shut down the passing game 
to preserve the win. Duquesne quarterback 
Shawn ODonnell was ineffective, collecting 
only nine yards and one first down in three 
final drives.
Both teams played a rugged first half, caus
ing referee Chuck Hunnell to dole out 90 yards 
in penalties. While many were inconsequen
tial, penalties set up both first half touch
downs.
The Carnegie Mellon defense seemed to 
have the Dukes stopped on their own 40 yard 
line with the game tied at 3-3. But after a third 
and seven incomplete pass, the Tartans were 
socked with a holding call that gave Duquesne 
new life at midfield.
Three plays later, junior tailback Sean 
McDonough broke a tackle at the line of scrim
mage and strode 37 yards into the end zone for 
a touchdown. McDonough, the spark plug of 
the Dukes offense, had an impressive 128 
yards on 19 carries for the evening.
But the jellow flag would also follow 
Duquesne. Already smarting from a brilliant 
20 yard punt return by CMUs Bill Cramer, 
which put the ball on the Duquesne 30, the 
Dukes were socked with a fifteen yard per
sonal foul.
The Tartans took full advantage of their field 
position, sending senior halfback Bill Heiser 
off the left side for a good eleven yard run to set 
up a first and goal at the five. But while 
Carnegie Mellon coaches pulled their hair out 
over another holding call on the next play, 
Mike Hensel found senior tight end Tim Kelly 
in the back of the end zone to knot the score at 
10-10.
Next Week: The Tartans open Presidents 
Athletic Conference play on Saturday with 
their longest trip of the year, up to John Carroll 
University in Cleveland. The Blue Streaks 
have a new head coach and quarterback, but 
have been 3-0 surprises thus far this season. 
They upset defending North Coast Athletic 
Conference champion Baldwin Wallace two 
weeks ago, and clobbered Thiel 40-0 on Satur
day.
Carroll is clearly tougher than expected. In 
order to preserve their undefeated record, the 
Tartans must be able to run with authority 
against the Blue Streak defense. But Carnegie 
Mellon will still be without injured fullbacks 
Chris Hansen and Eric Polkis, putting more 
pressure on the remaining backs, especially 
freshman Fran Bellante. Quarterback Mike 
Hensel has raised his completion percentage, 
and is running the ball well.
The defense still seems vulnerable to the run, 
giving up 215 yards against Duquesne on the 
ground, but still shows toughness in crucial 
situations. It isnt going to be an easy week for 
the Tartans, especially on the road.
By SHAFI KHAN
Tartan Staffwriter
As the field hockey Tartans travelled to 
Bethany, West Virginia, there was an unusual 
anxiety on the bus. Perhaps the team was just 
tired from all of their classes and decided to 
rest on the bus. Well, whatever it was, it didnt 
carry over to the game, because as soon as they 
stepped on the field, they were fired up and full 
of energy.
After a 7-1 thrashing by Bethany last year, 
the Lady Tartans wanted to show Bethany that 
they could play with them. That they did, and 
more. Having never beaten Bethany during 
the four years that Jan McDowell has been 
Head Coach of the field hockey team, the Lady 
Tartans pulled off an incredible, emotional 
upset win over the Bethany Bisons 1-0 in 
double overtime. Up against a better team, 
Coach McDowell told the team, Play like 
there is no tomorrow, and they all responded, 
with an incredible effort that lasted throughout 
the game.
A nervous anticipation was felt from the 
players on both sides as they lined up for the 
opening face-off and this intensity elevated 
throughout the game up until the final buzzer. 
The game contained all the elements for an 
exciting game: a fast playing surface, numer
ous scoring opportunities, sharp defense, 
minimum fouls, and excellent execution by 
both teams.
At the outset of the game, Bethany moved the 
ball well and put continuous pressure against 
Carnegie Mellons defense. Instead of crum
bling, though, the defense held off every one of 
Bethanys drives and managed to slow the 
pace down to a more comfortable level. Out
standing defense early on came from backs
Hetal Nanavati and Aelan Tierney.
By the middle of the first half, Bethany had 
lost its edge on speed and the Lady Tartans 
began to mount some serious pressure of their 
own. On one promising drive Eirene 
Yamamura fired a nice, low shot that barely 
missed the net, deflecting a foot wide of the 
net. With time running out in the first half, the 
Lady Tartans missed a golden opportunity to 
score when forward Sarah Fay centered a pass 
past the oncoming Bethany goalie in front of 
an open net, but nobody was there to blast it 
home.
In the second half, the Lady Tartans picked 
up their game and played evenly with the 
Bisons, matching them drive for drive and 
attacking each loose ball. Bethany had a few 
good shots that crossed to their center but no 
one was able to score from them. Back Jenny 
Saffren played intensely as she stopped sev
eral of Bethanys drives late in the game. Her 
intensity was fueled by a Bethany player who , 
constantly hit her in the knees.
When the second half had ended, and the 
scoreboard still showed 0-0, Bethany ap
peared to have lost their wind. They were 
frustrated by Carnegie Mellons determina
tion, solid play, and endurance.
By the time the first overtime rolled around, 
the momentum had clearly switched. Carne
gie Mellon now consistently put heavy pressure on Bethany and ran aggressively after 80 
minutes of intense hockey. Although the Lady 
Tartans didnt score, they were psyched to 
begin the second overtime.
In the second overtime, Carnegie Mellon 
didnt waste any time as they scored 1:15 into 
the overtime. Maya Sternberg banged in the

Mongolian Music and Dance Debuts at CMU
By LESLIE GRIFFIN
Assistant Diversions Editor 
It will be worth your while to take a break this 
Thursday night, October 1, to catch the Mon
golian Music and Dance Troupe performing at 
Carnegie Music Hall. The performance is an 
5 international event marking the opening of 
diplomatic and artistic ties between the U.S 
and the Peoples Republic of Mongolia. It also 
marks the troupes first appearance before 
Western audiences and their first visit to the 
United States.
They are flying directly from Mongolia to 
Pittsburgh, so this will be their first experience 
with the States. We want people to attend the 
"performance so they will have a warm welMongolian Dance uses grace and balance
come. says Verna Gillis, noted ethnomusicologist and member of CMUs music depart
ment faculty.
The troupes Pittsburgh appearance will kick 
off a tour being arranged by the New York 
city-based Asia Society which will take the 
performers on to such cities as New York, 
Washington D.C., Berkeley, California, and
The Pittsburgh Symphony Season
Using the universal language ofmusic, the Mongolian Music and Dance Troupe will make their U.S. Debut in Pittsburgh
Honolulu.
Situated in the northern Central Asian 
steppes between China and the U.S.S.R., the 
Mongolian Peoples Republic is the worlds 
largest landlocked country. Most Americans 
know of at least one famous Mongolian, 
Genghis Khan, whose 13th century conquests 
resulted in the famous Empire of the Golden 
Horde. To this day, the aura of Mongolian 
bravado is reflected in the daring horseman
ship, competitive wrestling and archery mat
ches, and virtuosic traditional performing arts.
The approximately two hour program will 
feature music and dance traditionally per
formed at village festivals. The colorfully 
costumed musicians and dancers of the Mon
golian ensemble will give audiences a lively 
look at the traditional entertainment of a nation 
that is rich in history and culture, yet whose 
songs, instruments and dances "are relatively
unknown in the Western world,  says Ms. 
Gillis.
New to most Americans, Ms. Gillis explains, 
will be the khoomei style of traditional sing
ing, where a single vocalist produces two 
tones simultaneously. The singer, while in
toning a long low note, simultaneously emits a 
series of very high, flute-like tones, creating 
the impression of one person singing chords.
The theme of horses, which is central to 
Mongolian folk life, pervades the program. 
This influence can be seen in several dances, 
like Breaking in the Horse where the dancer 
imitates the prowess of Mongolian equestri
ans with brilliant leaps and spins. The theme 
extends even to musical instruments  the. 
morinhoor, or horsehead fiddle, is a two 
stringed, vertically held fiddle which derives 
its name from the horses head sculpted into 
the wood above the tuning pegs.
In addition to the performance on Thursday 
night, the troupe will offer a workshop on 
Friday, October 2 from 10:00 am to 2:00 pm in 
the Alumni Concert Hall in the College of Fine 
Arts. Through interpreters, the artists will 
explain their instruments, vocal techniques 
and dances in greater detail.
The troupes appearance in Pittsburgh is 
largely due to the efforts of Music Department 
Head Joel Thome, an internationally known 
expert in global music, who worked with Ms. 
Gillis to arrange the visit. This group is in
dicative of the kind of things to come. We 
want to to bring the best from around the world 
here, says Ms. Gillis.
Tickets for the performance are $10 and $8, 
with a special $5 price for students and senior 
citizens. To make reservations call the Car
negie Mellon box office at 268-2407 between 
noon and 5:00 pm. Curtain is at 8:00 pm.
Salerno-Sonnenberg and Macal Captivate Symphony Audience
By LORI MAURER
Diversions Staffw'riter
The Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra contin
ued their 1987-88 concert subscription series 
at Heinz Hall this weekend with a program that 
included Roberto Sierras Jublio Overture, 
Mendelssohn*s Concerto in E Minor for Vio
lin and Orchestra, Opus 64, and Brahms 
Symphony No. 1 in C Minor, Opus 68. The 
symphony was directed by guest conductor 
Zdenek Macal of the Milwaukee Symphony 
Orchestra and featured renowned guest violin
ist, Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg.
The concert began with Roberto Sierras 
Jublio Overture. Sierras piece received its 
Pittsburgh Symphony debut this weekend. It 
was written by Puerto Rico native Sierra as a 
tribute to the three hundredth birthdays of 
Baroque composers Bach, Handel and Scar
latti. The Latin roots of the composer were 
apparent, particularly in the sections which 
involved strong percussion. Sierra's composi tion was a work of contrasts varying from eerie
strings to heavy percussion and between omi
nous brass and soothing woodwinds. Jublio 
ended in an accelerating pace of increasing 
dynamics.
The Symphonys rendition of Jublio was 
well-done and Macals familiarity with the 
work (he conducted its premiere with the 
Puerto Rico Orchestra in 1985) eased the 
apparent awkwardness of the symphony 
(compared to the traditional works of Men
delssohn and Brahms which followed). Over
all, Sierra's work was a unique tribute to the 
baroque era. The similarity of the two wasn't 
immediately apparent to the listener but the 
piece was exhilarating due to its Latin influ
ence and was more than adequately performed 
by the orchestra.
The program continued with Mendelssohn's 
Concerto in E Minor for Violin and Orchestra, 
which featured solo violinist Nadja SalernoSonnenberg. Salerno-Sonnenberg brought an 
extraordinary amount of zeal and emotion to 
Mendelssohns workin the first movement. Allegro molto appasionato, Salemo-Sonnenberg's interpreta
tion was so compelling that each note trans
fixed the audience. Salemo-Sonnenbergs 
playing in the Andante movement was breathtakingly beautiful, she showed that she could
easily make the contrast between the impas
sioned first movement and the romantic sec
ond movement. The Concertoended in a flour
ish with the Allegro molto vivace movement.

Drama Season Offers Mixture of Old and New
d1 8(nMmFI y6HF
Diversions Theatre Critic
The 1987-88 Drama Department Mainstage 
season is almost upon us. With their first play 
of the year previewing on October 7, the 
imminent season promises a great deal for 
theatre aficionados and occasional showgoers 
alike.
The season, looked at as a whole, might seem 
a bit patchwork at first glance. The plays were 
chosen earlier in the year by Drama Depart
ment Dean Elisabeth Orion in collaboration 
with the individual directors. Drama Dept. 
Assistant Dean Don Marinelli terms the sea
son - eclectic - really what you can come to 
expect from a professional training program. 
Two original musicals, three straight plays, 
and, sponsored by the Drama Dept., the Irish 
Universities Theatre Company. All in all, a 
vibrant and exciting combination.
The first play of the season is Berthold 
Brechts classic Good Woman Of Setzuan, 
directed by CMU alumnus (Class of 69) 
Anthony McKay. Mr. McKay has worked in 
the New York theatre for years, appearing on 
Broadway with Gilda Radner in Lunch Hour 
and in the Negro Ensemble Company produc
tion of The First Breeze Of Summer. OffBroadway he appeared in Moonchildren and 
at Gene Feist's notorious Roundabout The
atre. He has directed productions at Ensemble 
Studio Theatre, Playwrights Horizons, and 
others. This summer he directed Molieres 
George Dandin and A Doctor In Spite Of 
Himself here at the Carnegie Mellon Theatre 
Company. Deep in rehearsals at press time, 
Good Woman is expected to be an excellent 
start to the theatre season, with Director 
McKay incorporating musical elements, ex
perience and an experimentative bent in what 
is sure to be a fascinating show. Good Woman 
previews on the evenings of October 7 and 8, 
and opens the 9th to run through the 17th.
The second show is a world premiere work
shop musical production entitled Portrait by 
Ed Dixon, directed by CMUs Lee 
Sankowich. Mr. Dixon is well known as a 
Pittsburgh performer, having most recently 
appeared in the Civic Light Operas produc
tion of 1776 in July. Portrait is a new musical 
based on Oscar Wildes novel The Picture of 
Dorian Gray, about the infatuation of one man
such as Ken Keseys classic One Flew Over 
The Cuckoo's Nest. Unlike the others, 
however, Mary Barnes provides an optimistic 
look at a kind of halfway - house approach 
to mental illness that works. This production 
will probably be the most traditional theatre 
of the season, according to Dean Marinelli. 
Mary Barnes previews on February 17 and 18 
and opens on the 19th, running through the 
27th.
Broadway Cabaret, conceived and directed 
by Broadway choreographer and director (and 
CMU Associate Professor) Billy Wilson, will
eclectic; really what you can come to expect from a professional training program. _ Don Marine|li
with eternal youth. Mr. Dixon has brought the 
subject forward in time to the present and 
examines the old situation in a modem light. 
Portrait is being presented in cooperation with 
Chiron Productions. If this current workshop 
production goes well, plans are underway to 
stage a full-scale production for the summer 
season. Portrait is previewing November 4 
and 5 and opens on the 6th, running through 
the 14th.
The third production of the season is Mary 
Barnes, by David Edgar, directed by Lee 
Sankowich. The play is a product of the 1960s 
humanistic resurgence and deals with the 
journey of a young woman through and out of 
insanity in a British Hospital. Based on a true 
story, the play has been hailed by the London 
Times as passionate and compassionate and 
received other favorable notices. There are 
parallels between this play and other works
be the fourth production of the season and 
promises to be a smash. Director Wilson, this 
past summer in Vienna, Austria, put together 
a compilation of Broadways hottest musical 
numbers and produced it in a cabaret format. 
The result was a hit. Broadway Cabaret is 
having its American premiere here at Carnegie 
Mellon and is presented in cooperation with 
Carnegie Mellon Music. The show previews 
March 9 and 10 and opens on the 11 th, running 
through the 19th.
The final Drama Dept, production of the 
season will be Pirandellos haunting classic 
Six Characters In Search Of An Author, di
rected by Rina Yerushalmi. In this play, the 
actors and the audience together search to find 
what is real and what is illusion. Director 
Yerushalmi is a CMU alum and has worked in 
the theatres of Israel over the past few years, 
specifically the Haifa Municipal Theatre. She
originally directed Six Characters there, de
veloping the experimental outlook on the 
piece that will be seen here at CMU when the 
show premieres. According to Dean Mar
inelli, the entire production is non-traditional. 
from staging to costuming, and will provide a 
substantial challenge to student perform.*s 
and technicians. Look for Six Characters to* 
preview on April 13 and 14 and to open on the 
15th, running through the 23rd.
Also presented by the Drama Dept, this 
semester is a special four-day residency of the 
Irish Universities Theatre Company, Decem
ber 2-5 at the Kresge Theatre. This company, 
under the sponsorship of the Irish Gove.i.- 
ment, tours America and Europe, presenting 
productions such as J.M. Synges Playboy of 
the Western World, Becketts Waiting for 
Godot, and others. The performers include 
some of Irelands most talented young per
formers. Their appearance here at CMU this 
year is somewhat of a surprise - in the words of 
Dean Marinelli, it was just that one day, the 
phone rang. They are a heavily sponsoi Dd 
group, representing such companies as 
Guiness Beer and Aer Lingus. The Drama 
Dept, warns that ticket availability may be 
quite limited - order early.
All shows are playing in the Kresge Theatre, 
College of Fine Arts, and all start at 8 P.M. 
Tickets are available for all Drama Dept, 
shows at the CFA Box Office, located in t'jp 
entrance hall of CFA. The Box Office is open 
Mon. - Fri., noon to 5 P.M. The phone number 
there is 268-2407. Ticket prices vary, and 
schedules are subject to change, so call to 
reserve your tickets - Visa and Mastercard 
accepted.

Hellraiser is the Best Gore Flick of the 80s
Heres all you got to know about the history 
of red meat.
1963: Blood Feast. Herschell Gordon 
Lewis paints the screen red for the first time. 
The exact moment: when a girl gets her tongue 
ripped outon cameraby the maniac Egyp
tian caterer Fuad Ramses. The drive-in was 
Changed forever.
1968: Night of the Living Dead. George 
Romero creates the original Zombie Jubilee.
1974: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. 
Tobe Hooper directs the first true Hamburger 
Helper classic, and gives cannibals the respect
Joe Bob Goes 
to the Drive-In
they deserve.
1978: Halloween. Jamie Lee Curtis starts
10 years of teen-ager shish-ke^bob dinners.
1980: Friday the 13th. Jason puts on the 
hockey mask and makes dead high school kids 
into a standardized art form. Gore goes Holly
wood.
1982: The Evil dead. Sam Raimi makes the 
ultimate Spam-in-a-cabin movie.
1987: Hellraiser. Clive Barker shows the 
whole universe what its all about.
Im not kidding. Were talking new frontiers 
of fried flesh. The star of this flick gets so far 
into some kind of kinky Ayrab jungle sexfiend hocus-pocus swingers club that by the 
second scene of the movie hes getting flayed, 
frayed and filleted by this tribe of mutant 
needle-head octopus-face pus monsters that 
hes created out of his own imagination. We 
got steel hooks, we got manacles, we got 
chains and, yes, we got spare body parts on 
parade.
Heres something else you need to know. 
Remember the maniac mass murderer in the 
original Dirty Harry? The one that hijacks 
the school bus and has the crooked grin? The 
meanest man alive? Its an actor name of 
Andrew Robinson, and in this movie, HES 
THE GOOD GUY.
This is the first movie written and directed by 
Clive Barker, whos from the communist 
country of England, and basically what he did 
is he took the most frightening fear of the pale
face Hush-Puppy English weenie husband and 
made a whole movie about it. The basic idea is 
this: What would happen if your wife is so sick 
of your sniveling nerdy questions and your 
suckin up to her ever time you want something 
that she starts havin sex in the attic with devilhead slime monsters that remind her of your 
brother Frank who she used to have sex with 
before he got flayed and filleted and carried off 
by the nightmare sex monsters?
Sure, you say, its a common problem. 
Weve all been there. But the different thing 
about this movie is how Clive gives us a 
SOLUTION to the problem. One day, while 
theyre moving into a new house, the weenie 
husband slices open his hand on a nail and 
walks in on his wife while shes dreamin about 
making the sign of the double-humped sperm 
whale with Frank, and hes slopping 19 gal
lons of blood a second on the floor and he 
thinks hes gonna faint, and so the wife gets her 
stepdaughter to drive him to the hospital, only 
once hes gone somethin under the floor starts 
DRINKING the blood.
Frank is back from Devil Land, with most of 
his skin ripped off and his blood vessels ex
posed. Hes looked better. But heres the really 
gross part; He wants to get ROMANTIC.
Heres the really grosser part: SHE wants to

It only hurts when he shaves
get romantic.
Heres the one that makes the Vomit Meter 
go off the scale: they DO get romantic.
Theres only one problem: They cant go on 
meeting like this. Frank needs a whole bunch 
of blood to stuff down into his gizzards and 
starts the worlds most ambitious transplant 
surgery. Does she love him enough to go 
trolling her way through singles bars, hoping 
for bald-headed punching bags thatll nuzzle 
up beside her, ask her what her sign is, and trail 
her home for some claw-hammer skull-bash
ing? Of course she does. So now we got part 
vampire movie, part zombie movie, part trib
ute to Psycho and Chainsaw and all other 
documentaries on the life of Ed Gein, the Min
nesota body-parts specialist from the 50s. But 
theres one more thing this movie needs 
giant dragonhead lizard-gut glopola monsters.
Best gore flick of the 80s. No question.
We got 78 gallons blood. 147 gallons slime. 
Two breasts. Ten dead bodies. Chains. Bob
wire. Character actor taffy pull. Flaying. 
Clawing. Manacling. Gratuitous body parts. 
Gratuitous maggots, devil sex. Blood gur
gling. Glopola skeleton chasing, head bash
ing. Rat impaling, rat skinning. Face nailing. 
Claw Hammer Fu. Drive-In Academy Award 
nominations for Oliver Smith, as Frank the 
monster, for saying Every drop of blood you 
spill puts more flesh on my bones, and we both 
want THAT, dont we?; Doug Bradley, as the 
No. 1 mutant cenobite, the name of the 
nightmare Hamburger Helper people, for say
ing No tears, please, its a waste of good 
suffering; Andrew Robinson, as Larry, for 
being such a great weenie; Clive Barker, even 
though hes English; and Clare Higgins, as 
Julia, the wife who would do ANYTHING for 
the love of a zombie in the attic, even if it 
means sacrificing her personal ethics, this 
ladys got cruel lips, laser eyes, and is SCAR
IER than the monster.

Piantings. Prints, and more...Five Women Gallery Show
By EDIE LOCKE
Special to Diversions
Tonight marks the opening of a five woman, 
junior show at the Forbes Gallery, featuring 
the work of Nicole Herz, Jennifer Bauman, 
Erin Elman, Jennifer Nelson and Mary Beschen.
Nicole Herz will be showing paintings about 
houses, walls and fences. Previously, the 
architecture depicted in her work was dilapi
dated and destroyed but now Nicole is concenAt Forbes Gallery 
This Week...
trating on the original form, explaining it as an 
attraction to the texture of bricks and the struc
ture and forms of buildings. Specifically, she 
enjoys their angles and overlapping edges and 
finds Pittsburghs architecture especially suit
able. Her ideas concern nature taking over 
man-made structurea juxtaposition of the 
organic and the artificial. Walls and fences are 
an interesting idea, to Nicole who considers 
them to be middle barriers which have the 
power to conceal and hide. While interested in 
the psychological content of her work, Nicole 
is reluctant to analyze, remarking that often,
I just cant figure myself out. Nicole is 
influenced by the work of Van Gogh, Edward 
Hopper and German Expressionists such as 
Kirchner. For the future she will be studying 
wooden and clapboard structures for a variety 
of texture and will work on expanding her use 
of color.
Jennifer Bauman will be showing large 
acrylic paintings on paper. The work is about 
common objects which suddenly become
unique because of placement or the way the 
light falls. Using Matisse as a guide, Bauman 
seeks to get her colors working in relationship 
to one another and to explore how color influ
ences our everyday lives.
Erin Elman will be showing prints and new 
paintings where she uses bright color for the 
first time. While she calls it a lot of fun, Erin 
finds it difficult to control and considers these 
pieces to be transitional. Elmans prints and 
paintings work together, both containing land
scape references and both being about the 
texture of the medium, its form and its color. 
As shape is such an important part of her work, 
Elman studies the sculptures of Braque, 
Noguchi, Tapies and Eskimo work, using the 
influence of those forms and shapes in her 
paintings. Erin is concerned with the process 
and the actual act of paintingnot with what 
the image looks like. She wants to show 
movement in her work and also the mistakes. 
In conclusion, Erin says, Art is fun. 
Jennifer Nelson and Mary Beschen were 
unavailable for comment.

Pgh. Symphony Ends on
continued from page D1
and she seemed inexhaustible as she filled the 
stage with vitality. She had a theatrical stage 
presence and her facial expressions varied 
with the mood of the music. Her highly emo
tional interpretation brought tears to the eyes 
of some members of the audience as they stood 
to give her a much deserved standing ovation 
at the end of her performance.
Brahms Symphony No. 1 in C Minor 
brought the concert to a close. This symphony 
was comprised of four movements which were 
indicative of Brahms subtle and soothing 
style of music undermined by his own insecu
rity and self-doubt. The first movement, Un 
poco sostenuto: Allegro, shifted between 
themes,of dreary pathos to frustrated anger. 
The Andante movement was highlighted by 
the purity and clarity of the woodwind solos 
and its tranquility as opposed to the first 
movement. Un poco allegretto e grazioso, the 
third movement, was a continuation of the An
dante in the respect that it began with wood
wind solos.
However, the woodwind solos eventually 
gave way to a harsh brass melody and the 
movement continued to alternate between the 
two until it ended in a cheerful melody in the 
woodwind and strings. The last movement,
a High Note
Adagio - Allegro non troppo ma con brio, 
brought together the varied themes in Brahms 
work. It presented moods of anger, depression 
and happiness but eventually ended in exulta
tion as the accelerando of the vibrant melody 
seemed to indicate that goodness will over
come all.
Brahms Symphony was a perfect piece to 
showcase the talents of the Pittsburgh Sym
phony. The woodwinds were particularly 
strong and the contrasting dynamics and tem
pos gave the symphony and conductor, 
Zdenek Macal, the opportunity to end the 
evening brilliantly.
