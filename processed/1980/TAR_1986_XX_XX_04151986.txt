Carnegie Salutes Carnegie
By LISA MCA NANY
Tartan Editor-in-Chief
In addition to all the traditional events which 
comprise Spring Carnival at Carnegie Mellon, 
this years Carnival will offer something unique. 
Carnegie Salutes Carnegie, a two-hour plus 
extravaganza will be a festive culmination to the 
weekend.
Jerry Lewis, Barbara Feldon, Charles Haid, 
Ellen Burstyn, David Lander and many others 
will join host Andy Williams on stage for the 
April 19 show. Three-time Emmy Award win
ner Bob Finkel, a Carnegie Mellon alumnus, is 
working with noted television producer Lee 
Miller, another Carnegie Mellon alumnus, to 
produce and direct the show at the Civic Arena.
Lewis and Williams, two performers who are 
not Carnegie Mellon alumni, were asked to per
form because they have worked frequently with 
Carnegie Mellon show business alumni. Lewis 
is an honorary member of the universitys west 
coast clan or alumni group.
The gala will alos feature many student per
formers, including the Kiltie Band, the Carnegie 
Mellon Symphony Orchestra, the Cameron 
Choir, and the Jazz Band. Master bagpiper 
James McIntosh and the MacDonald Pipe Band, 
and Lee Cass, a professor in Carnegie Mellons 
music department will perform as well.
According to University Vice President R. 
Keith Moore, who is coordinating this event, 
there will be an audience of about 9,000. This 
is near capacity for the Civic arena when using 
the theatre style option because one bank of
seats is made inaccessible by the stage.
Carnegie Slautes Carnegie has already 
received coverage from USA Today The 
Associated Press, CBS News and many Los 
Angeles trade papers, like Variety.
Besides participating in the gala itself, some 
of the stars will be on campus to take part in 
other Carnival events, like buggy and booth 
judging. These celebrities as well as the pro
duction and technical staffs, many of whom are 
Carnegie Mellon alumni, are offering their time 
and talent free of charge.
While Carnegie Salutes Carnegie is the offical kick-off for the universitys $200 million 
capital campaign, it is not a fund-raising event. 
There will be no sales pitches or solicitation of 
donations. The evening is a celebration of the 
university and its people. Distiguished alumni 
in a variety' of professional fields will be honored 
at a formal dinner preceding the show and again 
during the program. These include Marvin L. 
Goldberger, president of the California Institute 
of Technology; Georege A. Roberts, president 
and director of Teledyne, Inc.; and Bud Yorkin, 
President of Bud Yorkin Productions, Inc. 
Carnegie Slautes Carnegie will not only be 
a memorable event in itself, but could easily 
make this a Spring Carneival which will not be 
topped for a long time. Particular thanks are 
due to Jackie Granger, Gretchen Van 
Grossman, and the whole Spring Carnival. 
Committee for putting an enormous amount of 
time and effort into the successful coordination 
of Carnival and the Civic Arena Show.
Buggy business. . . .
By JOHN FRIEDMANN
Tartan Business Manager
Its 6 a.m. on a chilly spring Sunday morn
ing. Representatives from all the campus frater
nities and several other organizations litter up
per Margaret Morrison Street. What brings 
these hundred-odd supposedly sane poeple out 
at such an ungodly hour? Buggy fever.
Since 1920, the buggy races have been the 
highlight of Spring Carnival. And since that 
time, the basic object has remained the same: 
to complete the one mile course in the shortest 
time. The course begins at Margaret Morrison 
Hall, proceeds up Margaret Morrison Street, 
then curves through Schenley Park, then makes 
a u-turn up the back hills on Frew Street to 
the finish line at GSIA. The most crucial part 
of the course is the chute, the part of the 
course where the buggies make the sharp turn 
on Frew Street. The hay bales lining both sides 
of the street are a testimony to the frequent 
spinouts and crashes that insure an extra large 
crowd on race day.
Although the course has remained unchang
ed, the technology of the buggies has advanc
ed hugely from the original crate-like creations 
of the 1920s. The buggies are now sleek, 
aerodynamically designed vehicles which roll 
at up to 40 mph. Currently, the latest buggy 
design change is a reduction in the number of 
wheels. Three wheelers (one in the front, two 
*n the rear) are gradually replacing four 
wheelers that have dominated since 1920. One 
contestant, Delta Upsilon, rolled a two-wheeler 
last year, and has produced another that was 
scheduled to run this year. An accident in the
photo by Bob Fishel
chute has made the possibility of the two
wheeler rolling on race day remote, however. 
Technological improvements, such as better 
wheels and chemically treating and pre-heating 
of those wheels, have been the major impetus 
behind the steady decline in course times over 
the years, although the record time of 2:09.0 
in 1983 has not as yet been battered. The next 
major barrier is the two-minute mark. Beta 
buggy co-chairman Denzil Boss predicts the 
two-minute mark will be broken, but no telling 
when.
Technology is only half the secret to buggy 
success. A good push team, the five individuals 
responsible for shoving the buggies over the 
uphill portions of the course. The key qualities 
of a successful pusher are speed combined with 
good upper body strength.
No less crucial is the sixth member of the 
buggy team, the driver. The difference between 
a good driver and a merely average driver can 
be the margin of victory. Usually a coed 54 
or smaller, and weighing less than 100 pounds, 
the drivers are expected to sacrifice much free 
time for free-rolls on Saturday and Sunday 
mornings and push practice each weekday 
night. During runs, they are belted into the bug
gies and have no freedom of movement, save 
that of their hands and feet to work brakes and 
to steer. The buggies, however, are carefully 
tested to insure driver safety, and injuries are 
few.
The total focus of all these efforts is 2lh 
minutes on Carnival Saturday. On that day and 
the preliminary Friday, buggies run the course 
in pairs, starting at 9 a.m. each day, competing 
for the next years bragging rights.

Carnival concert preview
By LISA MCANANY
Tartan Editor-inrChief
Each year, concert provide some of the most 
entertaining moments of Carnival. This year 
should be no exception with East Coast Offer
ing and Southside Johnny and the Jukes as two 
of the headliners.
East Coast Offering is a local jazz band with 
the kind of sound that brings to mind the theme 
from Barney Miller. They offer a laid-back, 
standard jazz sound, a mellow version of Spiro 
Gyra.
Southside Johnny, is a different story. His 
style is rock-n-roll through and through. Born 
down the Jersey shore, Johnny joined the Son
ny Kenn Blues Band at age 16. As the shore 
music scene started to coalesce, Johnnys 
musical mates included Miami Steve Van Zandt 
and Bruce Springsteen. It was Springsteen who 
wrote Southside Johnnys hit Fever. The 
jukes came together at the legendary Stone 
Pony in Asbury Park and became the house
band in 1974.
Johnny and the Jukes are know for their 
abilbity to communicate with the audience and 
generate uncommon intensity by involving the 
audience in the performance. I dont think 
weve ever done a concern where the audience 
hasnt been the main focus. I never want to 
restrict my audienceand Ive had a lot of trou
ble with security through the years, said 
Johnny.
Southside Johnnys music is based in a solid, 
steady beat, throaty, sexy sax and Johnny 
Lyons deep, gravelly vocals. Its the kind of 
music that begs to be performed live in front 
of an enthusicatic audience.
While East Coast Offering and Southide 
Johnny and the Jukes should prove to be two 
of the most exciting concerts during this years 
Spring Carnival, there are plenty of oppertunities to hear great live music. For a full listing 
of the Carnival events see the schedule in this 
supplement on the events section of Diversions.

Sweepstakes 86 promises to be another exciting season of buggy races. Here are a few shots of the first part of the race.The ever important Hill 1 (center left and on right), followed by the long roll down Hill 2 (top right). Hill 2 ends in the flag, which is used as a guide for entering the tricky and dangerous shute (bottom left).Even though last Sundays freerolls were cancelled due to wheather, most teams are ready for action. This years favorites are Beta, Sigma Nu, CIA, and Pika. See Compu Bookie, page 7, for details.

Special to The Tartan
Sigma Nu took sweepstakes last year as PiKas 
chances for a triple-crown fell on Hill 1. Last 
years second day times make one wonder 
whether or not we will see a new record in the 
near future. The new timing system was an in
stant success and having the top ten in the finals 
should help avoid controversy this year.
Last year we had very poor weather 
throughout the spring, but this year the only pro
blem was getting the permits. With all the 
wrecks we have been having lately it should be 
interesting to see whose hey-day it will be on 
Race Day.
This year everyone is wondering who will 
have the overall best time. Fringe and Theta 
Xi should still be around for the finals, but Beta, 
Sigma Nu, CIA and PiKa should finish on top 
once again.
The womens heats should pit last years win
ner CIA against Fringe, Kappa Alpha Theta and 
upstart Spirit with CIA once again coming up 
on top.
Good luck to all the organizations and 
everyone should look forward to another great 
and exciting Spring Carnival.
Mens Heats Predictions
1. Beta-AThey are whiping the slate clean, 
In hopes of echoing a 78 victory.
2. Sigma-Nu-ANothing radica-cal for the zoo 
this year, another strong finish.
3. CIA-AWill CIA be able to make the drop 
into the top three?
4. PiKa-AA few good tips may help them out 
this year.
5. Beta-BMay cutoff a few seconds this year.
6. PiKa-Bshould get down to Biz-ness.
Fringe Although being Reuda at push practice, 
Fringe could sting their way into the top ten 
this year with benefits from their alumni.
ATO After a poor Greek Sing performance, 
ATO has made sweeping changes in their 
buggy program and with a little angelic help, 
may be a contender this year.
Pi LamPi Lam is a legend for spinning out 
in the chute, but without pizza sauce on their 
wheels, they may fly this year.
SDC If SDC keeps heating their wheels, we 
may see a blue haze come Race Day.
Sigma NuSome may Estes-mate that their 
push team could use a little doctoring this 
year, but others believe their hay day is yet 
to come.
BetaBeta could have their butts around the 
keg if their push teams arent golden, but with 
the boss, their buggies should have a good 
year.
SAELook for them to take the womens races.
PiKaPiKa bearly made it over the hill last 
year, but with a few good brakes this year, 
PiKa could turn the races into a dogfight.
Theta XiIf Theta Xi can nip a little time 
during freeroll, and give their pushers better 
legs, they can paul their way to the top six.
Phi KapPhi Kap had their Phil of poor rolls, 
but this year you can be Scheuer they will 
make the top ten.
Kappa SigWhats the copp with Kappa Sig 
this year? A top ten finish will be a mirage 
because they will still be far behind no 
matter what lange-uage they use.
CIACIA left their Mark on the bales during 
freerolls, but with a little magic they can drop 
into the top 3 this year.
DUWe dont think a top ten finish is
possi ble, D.U.?
DTDDTD came out with spirit, but a crisis 
in freerolls force them to race only 1 buggy.
SpiritAfter coming out with great euthsiasm, 
spirit was Delt a blow in freerolls, therefore 
they will again be the poor Matt.

Pittsburgh Opera sings a Verdi classic
By STEFAN D. BROWN
Tartan Classical Music Critic 
Last weekends performances of a slightly 
abridged La Forza del Destino were the first in 
over twenty years. Thats too long to wait for 
such a terrific opera.
Based on a play by Don Angel de Saavedra, 
Due of Rivera, the story is concerned with the 
inevitable and uncontrollable force of destiny 
that propels the life of Don Alvaro, a doomed 
man from the moment of his birth. The Mar
quis of Calatrava refuses to allow him to marry 
his daughter Leonora because his mother was 
 the last of the Incas. The couple is caught 
in the process of eloping when Alvaro acciden
tally shoots the Marquis who curses them and 
i hence calling destiny into play. Don Carlo, his 
son, vows to kill the wretched couple. The lovers 
j become separated: Leonora becomes a hermit 
I and Don Alvaro assumes the name Don 
Frederic Herreros and becomes a great general.
| Carlo assumes the name Don Felice de Bornos 
! and joins the same regiment. Without knowing 
5 the identity of each other the two become good 
I friends. Later when challenged to a duel the 
i horrified Alvaro becomes a monk at the same 
j monestary where Leonora has been searching 
I for absolution. Five years later Carlo finds 
j Alvaro and challenges him again. Carlo is killI ed outside of his sisters hermitage. The dying 
\ unforgiving brother stabs his sister. She prays 
1 for Alvaros soul and dies.
This is real blood-and-thunder-get-theadrenalin-flowing theater. It really doesnt mat
ter that there are too many characters, or too 
many coincidences for a credible story. In adap
ting the play, motivations and explanations are 
lost and the work sprawls over* four almost 
unrelated acts. What does matter is that the 
master Verdi with his consummate insight was 
able to penetrate inside the characters. His 
music, with an overwhelming amount of 
I wonderful tunes, clearly expresses the emotions, 
motivations, and underlying psychology of the 
I characters. His use of recurring themes serves 
, to unify the w.rk but lacks Wagnerian developi ment. But Forza is recognized as a new develop| ment in Verdis own compositional style. 
I Premiered in 1862 it was the first of a new kind 
| of modernopera and made with ideas 
I rather than just a series of unrelated arias.
The performances here were much on the 
I uneven side. On Tuesday night the orchestra 
I under the baton of Anton Coppola gave a lack
luster performance. Particularly bad were the 
J violins which missed entrances, ragged cutoffs, 
screeching and unsure high notes, and a 
tendency to play on the soft side. The orchestra 
missed its chance to shine in the overture (in
 this production played between the prologue 
and the first act). This piece, added for performances in Italy, is a potpourri of the major 
tunes and as such the orchestra can take on 
Bits own personality and deliver emotional ex pression. Instead, except for a few warm lines
 from the clarinet, the playing lacked emotion,
 depth, and range of expression. The perfor mance of the opera as a whole was controlled, 
jdiiected an^ tightly knit into one cohesive piece. 
Surely this is counted for by Coppolas direcftion which was always sympathetic to the singers 
pnd the progression of the opera.
I Giovanna Casolla (replacing Stefka Evstatieva) 
pas one of four making a Pittsburgh debut. She 
Possesses a large soprano that is uneven only
at the top. Otherwise notes were sung with even
ness but an evenness that became excessive. 
Declarations of love, fear and religious ecstasy 
were delivered with the same vocal intensity. 
Her Pace, pace, mio Dio was flawed by a 
voice that lacked the flexibility of modulation 
necessary for Leonora. High points of singing 
occurred in the Prologues Io can Amanto? 
where her tone clearly portrayed conflicting 
emotions and the monestary scene where the 
progression from fear to religious ecstasy were 
well conveyed. Her pianissimo in La Verine 
degli angeli was clear and penetrating. After 
working with the role a bit Casolla will be an 
excellent Leonora.
Nunzio Todisco (replacing Giuseppe 
Gracomini) sang with a large tenor that, while 
possessing a full even tone, exhibits surprisingly
small emotional range. Couple this with limited 
and halfhearted acting and you have an Alvaro 
that is pleasant to hear but emotionally and 
dramatically uninteresting. Love for Leonora 
and hatred for her brother were sung so iden
tically that one scene could be substituted for 
the other. Todiscos acting appeared too rigid 
and mechanical. Perhaps he should just let go 
and permit the character to develop.
In his American debut baritone Eduard 
Toamgian performed the role of Don Carlo. His 
character was introduced in the overture as this 
production dropped the scene that normally in
troduces him. Even from this beginning it was 
obvious that there would be little of interest in 
this Carlo. As an actor he never fleshed out 
emotions and his body appeared forced into a
series of motions rather than natural reactions. 
This was most obvious in the scene directly after 
the batde. The wounded and dying Herreros 
has given his friend de Bornos a box the con
tents of which are to be burned upon his death. 
Carlo suspects that this man might be Alvaro 
because of the horror he displayed when the 
name Calatrava was mentioned. The suspicion 
is confirmed when the opened box yields let
ters from Leonora as well as a locket with her 
picture. The surgeon returns to say that the 
general will live. Carlo is thrilled because now 
he can have his revenge. This is clearly a 
dramatic scene that calls for a wide range of 
physical and vocal acting. Both were lacking. 
The text was recited rather than deleivered as 
a series of probes and revelations. The intensicontinued on page 6

Despite bad props Murder Room is enjoyable
By GARRETT YANKOU
Special to The Tartan
The opening of The Murder Room last 
Wednesday held a lot of mystery even for the 
cast and crew of Scotch & Soda. Unfortunately 
the cast had not rehearsed nearly enough with 
the intricate props and set. It was anyones 
guess what would happen next. Would the gun 
fire again? When would the lights go out? What 
was worse though was that it was hard to decide 
what exactly had happened. Just how many 
shots were there? What was happening behind 
the stage making all those thumping noises? 
Who was that woman in black on stage and why 
was she going upstairs into the Hollisters 
bedroom? And why did everyone say that they 
saw the dead Edgar standing there when the 
lights were out?
Jack Sharkeys mystery farce reminds me of 
old Monty Python reruns. The key point to be 
made is that it is funny. It takes place in the 
present time in the North Part of England. 
Basically it is about people with English accents 
who try really hard to say as many words as 
possible, as quickly as possible, and then follow 
their speech with one long whooping word. An 
example: Edgar, (to be said as if he has a hum
ming bird for a tongue) I didnt drink the... 
(to be said as if he were being paid by the hour) 
 . . . Cooooooooocoooooooooooa. The plot of 
the fortune seeking mistress who believes for 
some reason that she can kill off half of the 
world population without getting caught is also 
of some interest.
Frank Schurter plays Edgar Hollister, the ec
centric, missing man with the bad hairpiece, 
assumed by everyone of being murdered, and 
Constable Abel, who weve all seen somewhere 
before. Schurter handles the frequently flying 
dialogue expertly. This guy is on the ball; dur
ing the ill-fated opening night, he fell to the floor 
saying, Oh, the strain, a heart attack., when 
the gun that was supposed to finish him off 
decided not to work. When he and Michele 
Osherow, playing Edgars wife Mavis, appear 
on stage together, the sparks fly. Osherow lays 
it on thick sometimes which is funny. Along with 
acting well, she has mastered the art of rolling 
her eys and fainting. I was impressed that she 
kept her composure when the gun didnt fire. 
She only muttered to her husband, Hold on 
a minute dear, while I get this thing to work.
Enter Edgars dingbat daughter Susan with 
her newly found run-of-the-mill handsome
young American millionaire (self-described) 
fiance Barry and youve got the whole family. 
Its hard to tell if Ami Spicer who plays Susan 
is an awful or phenomenal actress. Her lines 
sound as if they are instructions given to a 
fourth-grader on how to build his own nuclear 
power plant. Then get some big cement blocks. 
Okay? Susan is cautious about sputtering forth 
anything from her mouth. Maybe thats because 
Susan cant do or say anything right. Thanks 
a lot Susan, follows nearly all of her stupid 
moves. Barry is played by David DesRoches. 
His character is in itself a farce, a humorous 
look at impolite undignified Americans.
Liz Rueger plays the elderly mumbling 
housekeeper Lottie Molloy. Rueger has a lot of 
character and any scene with her in it is bound 
to be funny. One exception is her scene with 
DesRoches. Its sort of like watching a person 
talk to cardboard. The only difference is that 
if cardboard talked, you might be able to 
understand what it was saying. Ruegers 
melodramatic actions and facial expressions 
work well with the play. Some of the actors 
should have remembered that the play is a 
mystery-^rce. A1 Morales plays Inspector James 
Crandall, an expressionless part played well 
with little expression.
The Murder Room will be performed tomor
row through Saturday at 8 p.m. in the Skibo 
ballroom. The play, directed by Mary Beth 
Gilmore, has a lot of good moments. The set 
is impressive. Maviss costumes are great 
especially her hot pink pjs. When the cast 
works together, which it does occasionally, the 
result is a very funny, entertaining play. When 
the characters ignore each other on stage, the 
problems will be worked out. With the lights go
ing out every ten seconds and the scrambling 
of the cast occurring every time the lights go 
out, the final scene of the play is certainly the 
funniest. The scene proves that it is possible 
to say, Get the gun. Get the lights. Dont shoot. 
Its me. three times (or more) fast.

Emma Masley at Pittsburgh Center for the Arts
By WALTER G. RITCHIE
Tartan Art Critic
The Pittsburgh Center for the Arts is currently 
displaying the work of Emma Masley, a visiting 
artist who taught last year in the CMU Depart
ment of Art. The show consists of paintings and 
mixed media constructions completed over re
cent years.
Masleys constructions are assemblages of 
two-dimensional planes of wood that either 
overlap or intersect, forming a deep threedimensional space. Combined with the wood are 
other media such as plastic, cardboard, and 
styrofoam, all of which come together to create 
a variety of form and texture.
A multiplicity of form covers the range from 
the abstract to the figurative. The observer can 
look into the construction and identify familiar 
objects while being forced to encounter the 
world of the unfamiliar.
Masleys colors are vibrant and bright. She 
tends more toward fluorescents in pinks, 
yellows, greens, and blues. The colors used will 
vary from one construction to the next, depen
ding on the theme or subject of the piece.
In Tassa de Mar, a sailing ship climbs up and 
over the surging waves of a turbulent sea. Below 
are the murky depths filled with fish and 
mythical creatures swimming in a tangle of wire
nets and underwater vegetation. An Ionic col
umn resting on the ocean bottom stands as a 
monument to a lost civilisation..
Pompeii seized a glimpse of the final days of 
this Roman city by the sea. An Ionic temple, 
occupying the center of the construction, is 
backed by jutting flames and an angry Vesuvius 
spewing ashes and hot lava. Human and animal 
forms can be detected within the domain of the 
temple, which is about to be engulfed by the 
flowing molten rock.
The highly stylized forms and images of 
Masleys three-dimensional constructions are 
transferred over to her two-dimensional pain
tings. In Mayan Jungle, we see once again both 
the figurative and the abstract. The forms of 
animals and creatures are discernable among 
the dense foilage and abstracted shapes.
Unlike her constructions, Masleys paintings 
lack a sense of depth and overall space. The 
forms in Mayan Jungle are extremely flat, reflec
ting the two-dimensional shapes of the construc
tions. But whereas the cut wooden forms come 
together to create a three-dimensional space, 
the images in the paintings merely accentuate 
the two-dimensionality of the canvas.
The Emma Masley exhibit ends April 20th. 
Pittsburgh Center for the Arts is on the corner 
of Fifth and Shady Avenues.
Jeff Justice is much more than a magician
By AMANDA COHEN
Tartan Comedy Critic
Never judge a magician by his posters. While 
his posters suggested that he was one of those 
flashy top-hat and tails magicians, Jeff Justice 
was actually a minimalist with his magic, but 
a definite maximalist in comedy. Sure, he used 
the old cards, handkerchief, animals (as it 
were), sponge balls, swords, and audience 
members, but in using them he got more laughs 
than magic. Which is not to say that the magic 
wasnt impeccable; as perfect as it was, the 
magic was far superceded by comedy.
Some people were fooled by the posters. At 
his show on Friday in the Wherrett room at
tracted a man with two roller-skating kids, as 
well as a packed house of students. The two kids 
were probably the most surprized when it 
became apparent that Jeff Justice was more 
comedian than anything. He saw them down in 
the front row and warned them, but they stayed 
and saw a show that will probably be etched 
in their little minds for years, warping their 
future attitudes towards normal magicians. 
Theyll be looking for spontaneous comedy, 
having been spoiled by the delightfully quick 
humor of Jeff Justice.
His ability to change subjects rapidly was part 
of his ability to stay one step ahead of the au
dience. While performing prepared material he
could forsake association and jump right from 
Wisconson to working out to drunk driving 
laws...in that order. But he was not so detatched as to forsake continuity, like Steven Wright, 
who finds no need for any sort of link at all. 
Justice had more of a conversational style of just 
saying what was funny, and sounding, if not be
ing, spontaneous. Even in normal conversation 
he was funny, and admitted to having been one 
of those class clowns who knew the corner bet
ter than the chalkboard, but his humor never 
stops.
In his improvisation he was fast, funny, and 
only slightly insulting to certain audience 
members, but only the ones who deserved it. 
He also had to improvise with mostly-willing 
volunteers for two of his magic tricks (the other 
two tricks were solo) and the laughs kept com
ing even after a volunteer named Jim got a 
sword through his neck. Many a bladder was 
loosed with that trick. It was ob\ ious that he was 
prepared to talk with people, but Justice could 
not have anticipated that the Activities Board 
banner would fall behind him. He made that 
almost as funny as anything he had prepared 
by pretending to swing on, salute, and sweep 
with the white banner.
For Jeff Justice, magic and comedy were a 
self-paced course. He literally found4 magic 
when he dicovered an old book of simple illu
sions, and started learning the tricks in the ac
tivity section of the Sunday Funnies. He work
ed for some time doing purely close-up, or 
sleight of had magic, and opened up a chain 
of magic shops. When he felt comedy seeping 
in under the tricks, he developed it and even
tually sold the magic shops to his partner and 
went to New York to work in comedy clubs, and 
also to take a class with City Limits, in im
provisation group sprung from the bosom of Se
cond City.
He let the magic fade out of his act (only in 
the literal sense), and he currendy performs on
ly a few tricks in a primarily stand-up routine. 
He also does an extended bit with a furry coil 
raccoon named Rocky who is controlled ex
quisitely by Justice and made to take part in 
some embarassing and downright painful stunts.
His tricks included pulling a scarf right 
through the mike stand, and it still amazed peo
ple even after repeating it four times and final
ly demonstrating how it was done in slow mo
tion and to the theme from Chariots of Fire. 
In another trick, the girl Justice volunteered 
could hardly stop giggling after he first told her 
that she would have to retrieve a deck of cards 
he had put in his pants, and then asked her if 
she had ever pulled a trick.
In comparison with past AB Coffeehouse per
formances, I almost dont....well, definitely 
dont hesitate to say that Jeff Justice was one 
of the best performers on campus this year. His 
act suggested that he had gotten his comedy in 
his magic and his magic in his comedy and 
decided Hey! They taste great together!4 The 
show was arranged by Valerie Villafana, who 
is a relative newcomer to AB Coffeehouse this 
year. Hopefully she will continue to pick em 
like she did for Friday night, and maybe even 
pick Jeff Justice again if were lucky.

Cole Porter and the PBT: A perfect match
By LISA McANANY
Tartan Editor-in-Chief
The Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre will perform the 
upbeat 1930s-style ballet Cole to close its 
1985-86 season. Cole, choreographed by 
I Wayne Soulant and danced to the music of Cole 
Porter is a short work featuring sophisticated 
waltzes, Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers-style 
w duets and even a fan dance.
Cole Porter, a favorite American composer, 
i reached the height of his popularity in the 
1930s with songs like Anything Goes,  
i "Begin the Beguine and Night and Day, all 
of which are featured in Cole. The ballet score 
[ was originally commissioned by Gary Sheldon, 
who high-lighted sections which used the inI timate and idiomatic sounds of a jazz combo, 
[ the kind of combo that Porter himself scored 
I for.
The elegance of Porters music and Soulants 
'}] choreography will also be reflected in the classic 
I costuming and the art deco set. Cole was 
; premiered last year by the Ballet Metropolitan 
I to great audience and critical acclaim.
Along with Cole, the Ballet Theatre will per
form two more short ballets in the seasons 
I finale: The Four Temperaments and Konigsmark. 
I The Four Temperaments is a ballet in one act 
I with music by Paul Hindemith and
choreography by the legendary George 
Balanchine.
The ballet is based on the ancient Greek 
belief that the human body is comprised of four 
temperaments: Melancholic, Sanguinic,
Phlegmatic and Choleric, which correspond to 
the four elements of Earth, Water, Air and Fire. 
The four sections will feature, in turn, a despon
dent male dancer, followed by a charming waltz 
for a duet, then another male solo and finally, 
the Choleric section features the entire 
ensemble.
Konigsmark, choreographed by the French 
choreographer, Andre Prokovsky, is set to part 
of Tchaikovskys Francesca de Ramini Over
ture. It is a story of intrigue, love and passion 
revolving around a Swedish prince, named 
Konigsmark, his mistress and the beautiful wife 
of Georg-Ludwig, son of the Elector of Hanover. 
The story moves at a compelling pace, rising 
and swelling with Tchaikovskys music. 
Konigsmark has been performed by many Euro
pean companies and received with acclaim.
The repertoire program will be performed on 
Thursday through Saturday, April 24-27. 
Students receive a 50% discount on the regular 
ticket price for Thursdays performance. Dont 
miss this upbeat, and at times jazzy closing to 
the Ballet season.
Half Life, Circus of Death at the Banana
} By MARNI HALASA
1 Special to The Tartan
Performances at the Electric Banana are an 
I artform. The dark damp sweetness arising from 
I the dance of the stomping skinheads, the sweat 
I of disruption reverberating from the audience, 
| and the sound of angry speakers screaming Nazi 
death threats pound enlightnment right through 
I the floorboards. Few appreciate the beauty of 
| this hell hole with the exception of an 
underground youth culture consisting of punkrockers and hardcore bands. However, ap
preciation was shown March 16th when approx
imately 130 souls sacrificed their comfort to 
cram their bodies into the Bananas mucoid en vironment to see a 3-band event featuring Half 
Life, Circus of Death, and Scre&m.
The gig started off with the popular native 
Pittsburgh band Half Life. Monotonous in perj formance, Half Life appealed somewhat to the 
I crowd, but not like they had in the past. They 
began with new material, Who Profits, 
I 'Wasted Day, and Errand of Mercy, which 
pulled the crowd into moshing circles of ecstasy, 
I yet pulled me into a slump of boredom due to 
a the repetition of the same chords and unclear 
l| lyrics. The bands timing was painfully off and 
the rhythm sections beat seemed to be totally 
oblivious to guitar and vocals, but all is not lost, 
s there is a philosophy. Half Life claims they do 
I not want to change the world. They try to stay
away from politics and tend to write more about 
personal relationships. Hence, it would seem 
that either the audience is very relationship 
minded, or fanatically supportive of their 
friends, because for sure it is not the quality 
of the music. Half Life has steadily gone 
downhill with each consecutive show I see, but 
their following gets larger. Has popularity made 
their audience as well as themselves take their 
music for granted? Will generic thrash become 
fashion? Who knows? Who cares? Yet for the 
sake of justice, if music isnt evaluated by its 
simple content, and its competency, how else 
will sincere judgements exist?
Circus of Death was second on the bill. 
Relatively new, they hit a very receptive au
dience with an explosion of metallic melodies 
and pounding rhythms. They began with Cries 
of Pain, Ignorance, and Pissed Off, full 
of captivating dissonance. Their song structure 
consists of an interesting pattern of slow in
troductions/thrash/slow refrains/thrash. This 
emphasized contrast in tempo added a strong 
appealing character to the bands overall per
formance, but why the dive into tedious thrash? 
Its noise boys, all noise. Trash it. There is 
nothing wrong with overwhelming thrash, but 
there is a fine line between musically transform
ed energy and loud disagreeable sounds. The 
key is innovation.
The climaxed with a hypnotic version of Iron
Crosss Crucify for Your Sins in which the 
crowd happily plunged into suicidal rapture, yet 
it was the combination of the slower melodic 
music plus the lead singers voice, reminiscent 
of a youthful Johnny Rotten, richly capturing 
the essence of the late 70s punk era, that was 
truly appealing. There is no doubt that an in
novative potential exists, we have yet to see them 
use it to its fullest extent.
Scream, a band from the Virgina-D.C. area 
was the last to rock. And rock they did with a 
moving, thought provoking performance 
highlighting such songs, Fight, American 
Justice, Gluesniff, and Amerarockers.
Live this band is an ever-consuming project 
that captures ones undivided attentionbut not 
from appearance. Scream is not into fashion, yet 
they are as well captivating with their music, 
stage presence, and most importantly, their 
lyrics.
In performance they play with an inexhaustable vigor. The intrepid Pete Stahl, the 
lead singer, relentlessly jumps, rolls, climbs on 
the stage, floor and amps. Skeeter (bass), forgo
ing the original dreadlocks, and Robert (lead 
guitar) concentrate in a deadlock of harmonic 
intensity, while Kent drums madly into alien 
dimensions. You didnt even have to hear them, 
just watching them would be enough.
The members of Scream say their band is a 
counterculture in which everbody is their own
individual, not conforming to any standard. 
Screams purpose is to make people more 
politically and socially aware of whats going on 
around them, as well as inside them. Interac
tion with the audience during performaces is 
important to Scream. However, its hard to ac
complish this state of consciousness when 95% 
of the time people are going off to the music 
and not really listening or thinking about what 
the lyrics are saying. They say that sometimes 
you can give something to someone, but if they 
dont take it, its not going to happen. Such is 
the case during Screams performance at the 
Banana. It did not happen. For the majority of 
the show, ten or 12 people crowded the stage 
while most of the crowd hovered in the back. 
The band gave everything, and in awkward 
times of desperation went faster rhythms, and 
funkier thrash while Petes wails of woe tried 
to grasp any leftover fragment of sensitivity. Un
fortunately it was of no use. The crowds indif
ference was so overwhelming it was embarrass
ing. The band stopped to a pocket pool oriented 
audience.
Screams performance was not given justice. 
I cannot understand why the crowd could not 
appreciate such a soul-wrenching gig. But more 
so, I cannot understand why almost everyone 
was enveloped in an aura of apathy. It has made 
me question their capacity to hold emotion, and 
their ability think.
Cartoon Exhibit
PITTSBURGH: The Art of Opinion, an in
ternational cartoon exhibition made up of 129 
original works from 43 leading editorial car
toonists, has been arranged by the Pittsburgh 
Post-Gazette and the Toledo Blade. This exhibit 
will open at the Pittsburgh Center for the Arts 
n March 30 through April 20, 1986 as the 
final exhibition of Political Art 86.
The exhibit is being presented by William and 
Paul Block, Jr., co-publishers of the 
newspapers, as part of the observance of the 
Post-Gazettes 200th anniversary this year and 
I the Blades 150th birthday reached in 1985.
1 have long admired the political cartoon 
I ^t unique combination of ideas and art, con
fined into a quiet small space and drawn within 
 a prescribed time limit, William Block, com
ments in a catalog introduction to the collection.
Humor, satire, ironythese are the weapons 
by which cartoonists seek the truth. This exhibi
tion gives the viewer a look at some of the best 
practioners of the art working today.
Among the cartoonists represented are 
Patrick Oliphant, Universal Press Syndicate; 
Jeffery MacNelly, Chicago Tribune; Bill 
Mauldin, Chicago Sun-Times; and M.G. Lord 
of Newsday, one of the first female political car
toonists to be syndicated nationally.
The cartoonists were invited to provide two 
cartoons on a subject of their own choosing and 
a third dealing specifically with the last 
presidential election.
The collection was most recently at OwensIllinois World Headquarters in Toledo and will 
travel to PPG Wintergarden April 24 through 
May 9 and to the Harford Courant in early fall.
At Forbes Gallery
By KATE BONELLO
Special to The Tartan
Jim Denney, a professor in CMUs Depart
ment of Art, will curate the Forbes Gallerys an
nual juried show opening tonight at 7 PM. 
Refreshments served and the public is invited.
Denney says that the juried show has no 
themes, no survey of any particular style or 
manner of art. Instead, he has chosen work in 
various media-painting, drawing, sculpture, 
prints-which, he says, I think would be in
teresting with each other....Im interested in 
works that will cause speculation and intrigue 
in the viewer. He says that many levels of 
education in art will be represented, from 
graduate students and expert painters to 
beginners.
He stresses that the work shown is selected 
according to his own vision: No compromise. 
I dont have to be fair. At the same time, theres 
very high quality work being done here, and 
people should see it. Since Denney plans to 
select a group of work and then experiment with 
its arrangement in the gallery space, the con
tent of the show represents an individual and 
extemporaneous treatment of the space; the ex
hibit will combine both the eyes of the in
dividual artists and the eye of the curator.
On Thursday at the Forbes Gallery, the 
CMU Writers Guild will host a Reading at 
Forbes. Four student writers will read from 
their work, starting at 7 p.m. Once again, 
refreshments are served and the public is 
invited.

Frick Museum presents Dutch gardens
PITTSBURGH, PAMarch 14, 1986. Gardens 
of Earthly Delight: Sixteenth and SeventeenCentury Netherlandish Gardens will open at The 
Frick Art Museum in Point Breeze on Thurs
day, April 3.
Second in the series of temporary exhibitions 
begun by The Frick Art Museum last fall, 
Gardens of Earthly Delight is the first organiz
ed specifically for the museum by its new 
curator Kahren J. Hellerstedt. As the show has 
been assembled since Dr. Hellerstedts appoint
ment to The Frick Art Museum in July 1985, 
it will not travel; it will be seen only in Pittsburgh 
and only until May 18.
Works in the exhibition range in date from 
1565 to the late seventeenth century and in
clude oils, etchings, engravings, drawings, and 
rare books.
Although Gardens of Earthly Delight crowns 
The Frick Art Museums spring series on garden 
history and landscape architecture, the exhibi
tion does not focus on the appearance or struc
ture of Dutch gardens. Rather it calls upon the 
tradition of emblematic art and stresses not only 
what and how the artist painted, but why.
Divided into four sections, the exhibition ex
plores the artists' use of lush, imaginary gardens 
as settings for allegories, myths, biblical tales, 
amatory encounters, and, most extensively, Dr. 
Hellerstedts special interest, the buitenpartijen 
or outdoor party. The buitenpartijen, a new art
istic genre of the early decades of the seven
teenth century, was a by-product of the 
Netherlandish traditon and the new affluence 
of the Dutch Republic. The final paintings in 
'he show provide still lovely gardens, stripped 
of icongraphic significance, that serve simply 
as settings for the family portraits of the rich.
While the lenders to the exhibition range from 
giant museums to private collectors, the works 
shown are assembled mostly from the eastern 
United States. Speaking of this relatively nar
row range, Dr. Hellerstedt comments that 
although there are items one could have wish
ed to include if a wider net could have been 
cast, from our selection the viewer can come

ty of the necessary emotions went unexpress
ed. But to be fair, Tomagian sang a Morir! 
Tronenda cosa! that exhibited a strong, even, 
full voice possessing great skill and technique.
The cosmic Brother Melitone was played in 
a very human manner that relied more on 
characterization than slapstick. Juan Pedro Gar
cia Marques stressed the shortcomings that 
made Melitone a person. While Alvar is driven 
by fate to kill off the Calatrava clan, Carlo is 
obsessed with revenge, and while Leonora is 
driven by massive guilt to a life of seclusion and 
insanity, Melitone must deal with the everyday. 
He gets upset when asked to do favors out of 
season. He gets angry at a crowd of ungrateful 
beggars. He wants to know the identity of 
mysterious hermits. This was conveyed by the 
simple gesture of moving his lantern a tiny bit 
closer to Leonoras shrouded face. Marques 
voice large but flexible and the patter of Toh! 
Toh! Poffare il mondo! (Whew! Whew! Land 
sakes alive!) was never garbled. His tone was 
rich and expressive.
Susanne Marsee, seen here last January in Cosi 
Fan Tutte, had the smallest voice and was fre
quently drowned out by the orchestra. Com
plicating this was a vocal thinness that did not 
allow the production of a full tone. As an ac
tress she was able to achieve a whole range of 
emotions with simple body and facial gestures.
The role of Father Guardiano is very limited 
with few moments to shine. John Tomlinson 
compensated with a bass that was rich and lux
uriously velvety. Full of range, emotion, and 
vocal color his was the most aurally satisfying 
performance of the evening.
Patricia Griffin (Leonoras maid), Kenneth 
Cox (The Marquis), David Orcott (military 
surgeon), and David Dreher (a peddler), made 
their brief appearances and sung with skill.
The chorus sang and acted well in the crowd 
scenes. The exception was the scene in the 
church where the male chorus was hardly ever 
together.
Bodo Igesz, director, made efficient use of the 
stage. The already mentioned crowd scenes 
were never cluttered with a bunch of people who 
did not know what to do. Unfortunately, this 
production was dark in every scene and so 
much so that those in the back of the hall had 
problems seeing the action. I was disappointed 
that in the church scene Leonora and the monks 
pray to an offstage cross. Or rather two offstage 
crosses. It was distracting and a great deal of 
intensity was lost. Sets were flimsy and 
uninteresting.

A little too much of a good thing in Gung Ho
By BRUCE KASREL
Tartan Entertainment Editor
Have you ever had a mixed drink that is 
prepared with only the finest ingredients, yet 
proportioned so improperly that it does not taste 
as good as expected? If so, then you will unders
tand how I feel about the movie Gung Ho (Para
mount). The actors, director, writers, and musi
cians are all top notch, but somehow the pic
ture isnt quite what we have come to expect 
from such talent.
Directed by Ron Howard and starring 
Michael Keaton, Gung Ho features the direc
tor/actor team that was responsible for the suc
cess of Night Shift in 1982. Here, like in their 
earlier effort, Howard lets Michael Keaton be 
Michael Keaton. And as a result of this, the film 
has a natural and believable feel to it.
Gung Ho is a comedy/social commentary 
about the cultural differences between the 
United States and Japan. The story line is clear, 
simple, and realistic (it is baaed on a segment 
that aired on 60 Minutes). A small town in 
western Pennsylvania, Hadleyville (much of the 
filming took place in and around Pittsburgh) has 
depended upon the local auto plant for its only 
source of economic livelihood. The plant has
been shut down and the town is crumbling. 
Enter Hunt Stevenson (Keaton), who travels to 
Japan to convince Assan Motors to rejuvenate 
the plant. Of course the Japanese agree, and 
the rest of the movie deals with the East meets 
West culture battle.
Instead of becoming just apple pie versus 
sushi, Gung Ho (slang for work together) 
takes on a more serious look. Unlike so many 
pro-USA films on the screens (Rambo II,Rocky 
IV) this film points out the defects in our socie
ty as well as Japans. The film is about mistakes 
made on both sides, and then what each must 
do to rectify them.
The film centers around the relationship bet
ween Stevenson, the employee representative, 
and the plant manager Kazahiro (played by 
Gedde Wantanabe). Their characters are equal
ly likable and their performances are equally 
brilliant. Both Keaton and Wantanbe play their 
roles with a genuine and natural viewpoint that 
it is hard to pick sides in the movie. Both are 
put in extremely precarious predicaments. Hunt 
must convince his men that they have to give 
up a lot of benefits in order for the plant to 
operate. And Kazahiro must produce a profit 
from a plant that employs American workers
(who put family before the company).
Every time these two are on the screen, we 
see their insecurities and anxieties shine 
through. They are constantly at each others 
throat, yelling about how bad the others coun
try is. The insults on both sides are not crude
or offensive, but rather humorous and insightful.
Keaton delivers his lines with his snappy style 
and cocky attitude. Because Keaton looks and 
feels the part, his performance is brilliant yet 
not overly theatrical. He never lets himself get 
caught in the trap of being some kind of super
hero, he is just a ordinary guy put into an ex
traordinary position. When Keaton is dealing 
with the American workers, you get the sense 
that they trust him yet dont quite believe him. 
Who could blame them, with the look on 
Keatons face almost trust me, I would never 
do anything to hurt you, well almost anything.
Wananabe takes on a more subtle approach. 
You may recognize Wantanabe from 16 
Candles as the exchange student Long Duck 
Dong, but here his part is not nearly as 
degrading or falsly stereotypical. He is sent over 
to manage the plant under tremendous pressure 
to produce at levels comprable to plants in his 
homeland. Thus he must deal with the 
American way doing things in the workplace 
and in the home. His kids watch MTV and his 
wife shops at Sears while at work the local 
workers want too much money and time off. On 
screen you can see the conflict within him- one 
side a very traditional Japanese worker, the 
other, a sensitive and understanding family 
man. Wantanabe plays both with excellence and 
conviction. One point late in the film, where he 
and Keaton are having a few ICs at the local 
bowling alley, he even beats Keaton at his own 
game- spontaneous comedy.
Whether these two are working together or 
separately, they are a pleasure to watch.
As I mentioned earlier, this movie is not quite 
proportioned properly and the culprit is the 
script, or lack of, involving everyone else ex
cept Keaton and Wantanabe. Both George 
Wendt and Mimi Rodgers, as Keatons best 
buddy and love interest respectively, have such 
minor supporting roles that it is hard to grasp 
their characters. Screen writers Lowell Ganz 
and Babaloo Mandel give Keaton and Wan
tanabe ALL the good lines and in the process 
smother the rest of the cast, which is quite 
talented (including Soh Yamamura who is one 
of Japans most revered actors).
It is hard to imagine how the director of one 
of the finest ensemble pieces in years, Cocoon, 
would let this happen. Obviously Howard feels 
comfortable letting Keaton do his own thing, 
perhaps too comfortable. Technicaly speaking, 
Howards direction is superb. His use of camera 
angles, music, and especially his pacing are all 
right on the money. Also, his story telling abili
ty has not deserted him either. Though the 
movie has its faults, it moves along at a smooth 
pace. One more thing worth mentioning is Stevie 
Ray Vaughan guitar work. His gritty sound fits 
perfectly over the assembly line scenes.
Although Gung Ho has its defects its hardly 
enough for a recall by the manufacturer. Like 
one of the workers on the line says, every car 
has a few defects, nobodys perfect.

Tartan Poetry Critic
Carolyn Doty read fiction in the Adamson 
Wing on the evening of April 9th. She is the 
author of A Day Late and Fly Away Home. Much 
of Dotys work depicts the lifestyles and land
scapes of the American West. A native of Utah, 
she lives in California and has taught at the 
University of California-Irvine and San Fran
cisco State.
The first story Doty read, however, concern
ed New Yorks street people. Set in Manhattan, 
this short piece is an exercise in speculation. 
The narrator becomes increasingly curious 
about a well-dressed woman who haunts the 
street outside her apartment. She imagines the 
derelict to be an unhappy hieress and constructs 
and elaborate scenario explaining her fate. In 
the course of these fantasies, the narrator 
reveals much about her own character and the 
way she relates to people. The authors careful 
eye for detail and skilled use of exposition (a 
technique many writers shy away from) com
bined to make the story vivid and effective.
Doty also read the first chapter of A Day Late 
, which depicts the anguish of a traveling 
salesman whose daughter has died of cancer. 
Against the backdrop of the Arizona desert, he 
searches for affection and tries to blot out his 
grief. In a small diner, he broods over his guilt 
and takes comfort in the attentions of a waitress. 
The desert salt flats serve as a metaphor for his 
sense of loss and emptiness.
Dotys prose displays a depth of feeling for 
the people and territory she describes. Her 
reading would have been more entertaining if 
she had spoken with similar emotion; she rare
ly made use of inflection and her voice tended 
toward a monotone. For the purposes of a public 
reading, she might have read with a livelier 
style. Nonetheless, the quality of her fiction 
marks her as a perceptive and sensitive 
craftswoman.
Carolyn Doty's apperarance was sponsored by 
the CMU Visiting Writers Series.

Netherlands Dance Theatre performs next week
PITTSBURGHAs the second of its three 
spring programs, the Pittsburgh Dance Coun
cil will present the Netherlands Dance Theatre 
Junior, on April 21 at 8 p.m. in Heinz Hall.
The Netherlands Dance Theatre Junior began 
in 1959, when a group of rebel dancers and 
choreographers, anxious to free themselves 
from traditional dance, decided to explore the 
V structure of contemporary forms. Eager and 
malleable, the company absorbed the new spirit 
of American dance vocabulary into their own 
European classical training.
The experiment was an instant success. Train
ed daily in classical technique and equally at 
home on pointe or barefoot, the company 
developed an exceptional spirit and strength that 
won it acclaim as one of the major comtemporary dance companies throughout Europe, 
America, and-Australia. In contrast to other resi
dent companies, the NDT Junior has no star 
4 ... system, but relies on dancers with distinct personalites who are all soloists in their own right.
Since 1979, the companys major 
choreographic spirit has been Jiri Kylian, its ar
tistic director and one of Europes most soughtafter choreographers. Kylian has steadily inI jected his own fluid and supple lines into the
CMU Visitingj: Writers Series presents...
ensembles unique repertoire, creating a 
seamless blend of classical and free styles. Pitts
burgh audiences will see the 13-member tour
ing company perform his Nomaden to the 
music of Stravinsky, and the trademark 
Cathedrale Engloutie to Debussy. Two of the 
four works on the program will be accompanied 
by a concert pianist.
The Netherlands Dance Theatre Junior has 
done the impossible, said Margeaux Singleton, 
PDC Executive Director. It has combined the 
elegance and discipline of classical ballet with 
the driving passion of modern dance into one 
stunning performance style. The result is an ex
traordinary virtuosity that will delight both ballet 
lovers and modern dance aficionados.
The companys spring tour will include per
formances in Paris, Madrid, Frankfurt, The 
Hague, Seattle, Sarasota, and the Metropolitan 
Opera House in New York City.
Tickets for the NDT Junior program are 
available now through the Heinz Hall Box Of
fice (Monday through Friday, 10 a.m.-6 p.m., 
Saturday 12 noon-6 p.m.), by calling TicketCharge at 392-4900 or the PDC Office at 
355-0330 (8 a.m.-6 p.m. weekdays), as well 
as Kaufmanns, Gimbels and TIX.

The Stones, Noise and more from the Syndicate
By THE SYNDICATE
Tartan Record Critics
Art Of Noise 
In Visible Silence 
China Records
The latest release from Art Of Noise In Visi
ble Silence, demonstrates continual use of both 
the unique sound editing and experimentation 
of the trio. Yes, the industrial sounds and the 
aggresively edited voices as are all here, but this 
album represents ne,w exploration and more 
variations on the theme.
Previous albums leaned towards dance/funk 
and a often offbeat sound. Those themes are 
present here but listeners aquainted with the 
group will find a new element - more mellow, 
ambiant manner.
Legs represents the danciests number on 
the album and has been doing the Top 40 cir
cuit for a few weeks. Their remix of the Peter 
Gun Theme uses pure percussion and 
primitive electric guitar with a modern, pro
gressive sound (is it a voice, or is it a 
synthesizer?).
Listen to this alburn- youll hear elation, fear 
(Paranoimia), sadness- true emotion from 
familiar sounds of both instruments and sounds 
from todays world.
In the same manner as they presented images 
of war on a previous album, Art of Noise creates 
a vivid image of political oppression in South 
Africa. Not with poetic lyrics, but by mixing ac
tual public statements and emotion packed 
music. Instruments of Darkness opens with 
a recorded voice ... I have given instructions 
for appropriate steps to be taken to restore law 
and order. An ominous overture. The fuse 
is lit... musical images of tension and destruc
tion... It isnt said but its there. Literal excerpts 
of public speeches with expressive music pro
ves to be a powerful vehicle for emotion.
NITE LIZARD
The Rolling Stones 
Dirty Work 
CBS Records
After one listens to the Rolling Stones newest 
album, Dirty Work, for the first time, all doubt 
that the band wall rock no more is erased. Yet, 
a few additional listenings quickly makes it ob
vious that the last of the supergroups will soon 
be dead.
Initially the songs lively beat attracts the 
listener to Dirty Work. But then, one notices 
something which is rather disturbing: the Stones 
have developed REO Speedwagon syn
drome. Yes, thats right! Most of the songs 
sound the same. A few different guitar chords 
and some new words are all that enable anyone 
to discern between them.
There are a few glimmers of hope. The title 
song, Dirty Work, and One Hit (to the body) have 
good rhythm and are enlivened by Jaggers 
relentless energy. But they do not differ enough 
from the majority to be classified as good tunes.
One of two songs not featuring Jagger on lead 
vocals is also decent. Sleep Tonight has a bit 
of Dire Straits sound to it. However, the song 
is a long way from the top ten. In fact, I have 
yet to hear it on the radio.
The only other above average song is Harlem 
Shuffle. Its tempo is much slower than that of 
most of the songs. What I dont understand is 
why it was the first song released. Harlem Shuf
fle is hardly a good indicator of what the rest 
of Dirty Work is like. A thirty-second long piano 
piece at the end of the album (it is not even 
listed) also exhibits this jazz elementbut it is 
also too little too late.
If the Stones were trying to tie the album 
together with a unifying theme in the manner 
of the Moody Blues, they really missed the boat.
Simply stated, Dirty Work is a disappointment. 
It is difficult to understand how a group which 
created such classics as Paint it Black and 
Honky Tonk Woman could produce such trash.
Perhaps theyve been taking too many of 
mothers little helpers. Then again, maybe they 
havent been taking enough.

Elvis Costello 
King of America 
CBS Records
Costello came in 1978 when, in the midst of 
his first Stateside tour, he performed a volatile 
live set on NBCs Saturday Night. In perhaps 
his proudest moment as the definitive Angry 
Young Man, Costello tore into FM radio with 
the unrelenting Radio Radio. Ten years and a 
dozen albums later, Costello has mellowedat 
least on the surface. Gone are the quixotic jerks 
of an anorexic Buddy Holly, along with the 
mouth almighty that threatened his career on 
more than one occasion: What remains is 
perhaps the most refined pop lyricist in the 
business. Whats more, with the release of the 
single, Dont Let Me Be Misunderstood (a 
remake of the Animals classic) Elvis appears to 
be on the verge of the broader acceptance he 
has so long sought in America.
After a two year hiatus from recording, 
Costello is back - this time, as Declan Patrick 
Aloysius MacManus (his real name), having 
gone to court to legally lay to rest the fictitious 
Elvis. Unlike John Cougar Mellencamp, 
however, Mr. MacManus still answers to his 
stage name. This years entry is titled, King of 
America, and is credited to The Costello Show 
(Featuring Elvis Costello). This, the first time 
since his debut Elvis has played sans his ace 
sidekicks, The Attractions. The album features 
in excess of a dozen musiciansfrom former 
members of Elvis Presleys band, to jazz sessionist, Jerry Scheff, to Los Lobos Dave 
Hidalgo. The result is an uncommonly textured 
work, reminiscent of the 1982 milestone, Im
perial Bedroom.
The album marks a return to the often unkind 
self-analysis lacking on Elvis last two records. 
The first track Brilliant Mistake is a retrospective look at the career of a critics pet/ was 
a fine idea at the time, now Im a brilliant 
mistake.... Here, as in other tracks, subtle 
traces of the old Elvis come peaking through. 
The lyrics allude to the bitterness and frustra
tion unleashed in such early classics as "Im 
Not Angry, and Lipstick Vogue. The pro
duction, by both Elvis and comrade, T-Bone 
Burnette is sparse and tasteful, highlighting 
acoustic guitars (handled exceptionally well by 
Costello himselfa man whos guitar work has 
been referred to as grinding in the past), 
brushes and a lush double-bass. With Indoor 
Fireworks, a song originally penned for pal 
Nick Lowe, Costello shows his deftness in 
manipulating a single metaphor for an extend
ed period without seeming contrived.
Side Two is more of the samethrough the 
accordian tinged, American Without Tears 
and the smoke-filled cabaret of Poisoned 
Rose, to the infectuous slap of The Big 
Light, a satirists tribute to a hangover.
Suit of Lights (the only tune on which the 
Attractions play) is a eulogy to Costellos father, 
Ross MacManus, a once popular Big Band 
leader. The lyric recounts the downfall of a 
classic tragic hero, the despondent musician 
subject to the whims of a restless audiences. ... 
they pulled him out of the cold, cold ground and 
they put him in a suit of lights. 
The albums closing song, Sleep of the Just 
is a lifting memorial to whatever Declan Mac
Manus resents about Elvis Costelloa sentimen
tal farewell to the nervous energy of an 
obsessive alter ego, And now you say that 
you ve got to go if you must you must I suppose 
you need the sleep of the just...

Wrestlemania II: The event to end all events
By JOE BOLTZ
Tartan Wrestling Critic
Last weekend at the Syria Mosque I was 
witness to event I will not soon forget. I have 
never seen so many drunken, tatooed people 
gathered together in one place. But the people 
there were ready to witness the greatest spor
ting event ever in the history of mankind, 
Wrestlemania II, What the world has come 
to.
The crowd was in an extremely intense mood. 
You could cut the smoke-riddled air with a 
knife. The people were waiting for the barn
burner of bam-burners, the white-knuckler of 
white-knucklers. OK, OK. Enough cliches, but 
its wrestling!! An evening of body slams and 
suplexes was just about ready to begin.
The first match in this wrestling extravagan
za was Mr. Wonderful, Paul Orondorf vs. The 
Magnificent One, Don Muraco. Muraco was led 
into the ring by his manager, the sinister Mr. 
Fugi. The two men traded off body slams and 
punches and the wrestlers ended up out on the 
hard concrete floor. Of course the wrestlers 
were both counted out of the ring and a draw 
was issued.
The next match was for the Inter-Continental 
Championship and it pitted the champion Ran
dy Macho Man Savage against the wildest 
wrestler in the World Wrestling Federation: 
George the Animal Steele. As usual, George 
brought in a flower for the Macho Mans 
manager, Elizabeth. The Animal tears up a 
turnbuckle; Savage blatantly disregards the 
rules and uses the ropes to his advantage and 
wins the match to the dismay of the audience.
In probably the only loser match George 
Will was pinned and then humiliated by Jake
the Snake Roberts. Roberts used a 20-foot-long 
python to psych out his opponents.
Next came one of the main events: Rowdy 
Roddy Piper boxed Mr. T in a ten-round fight. 
This is occured because of what happened on 
Saturdays Main Event, when Piper whipped 
Mr. T with a belt. Piper knocks down Mr. T in 
the second round, but Mr. T reverses that and 
knocks Piper down twice in the third round. 
Once again Piper rebels against the rules and 
slams Mr. T to the ground. Mr. T wins on a 
disqualification.
Up for grabs next was the Womens Cham
pionship belt, held off and on by the Fabulous 
Moulah for 28 years. She faced Velvet McIn
tyre, the Irish bombshell. The match consisted 
of a lot of big-butted women throwing each other 
around. Moulah wins.
Rocky IV move over, now we have the real 
Russia vs. USA fight: Nikolai Volkoff vs. Cor
poral Kirschner. Kirschner snatched the cane 
meant for Volkoff and used it to his advantage 
to smack the head of Volkoff. It was then an 
easy win for Kirschner.
The next match is a special 20-man-over-thetop-rope Batde Royal. With six football players 
involved, it proved to be a wild and wooly event. 
After the demise of sixteen wrestlers and foot
ball playaers, including the like of Bill Fralic, 
the Refrigerator, William Perry, and , and John 
Studd, all that are left are Andre the Giant, Russ 
Francis, and the Hart Foundation of Jim 
Neidhard and Brett Harte. After the dust settl
ed, Andre won by throwing Brett Harte out on
to the hard concrete floor.
The Tag-Team championship was next with 
Brutus Beefcake and Greg Valentine tryed to 
defend their title against the British Bulldogs 
and their manager, Lou Albano. The special 
ring-side advisor to the bulldogs was Ozzy 
Osborne. The Bulldogs used their speed and 
agility to out-maneuver the champions and win 
the title by using a flying headbutt to seal the 
victory.
Two other matches pitted Adrian Adonis 
against Uncle Elmer and Ricky Steamboat 
against Hercules Hernandez. Adonis and 
Steamboat won easily.
Now its time for the Main Event, the cage 
match between Hulk Hogan and King Kong 
Bundy. The champion Hogan has to go up 
against the almost 500-pound Bundy. In a rein
forced cage Hogan pounded the mammoth Bun
dy into a bloody mess and won the match by 
climbing outside the ring first.
The crowd in the Syria Mosque is now stan
ding and cheering for the champion. I suppose 
they will now go home and tell their friends 
about how great the matches were, and they will 
be right; it was fantastic.
I want to make one thing clear. Although I 
have been watching wrestling for many years, 
I do not believe that wrestling is completely real, 
but it is entertainment in its purest form. It is 
good versus evil and there is a winner, be it the 
hero or the villain.
Editors Note: This article is ment to account for 
the events that transpired at Wrestlemania II, 
is NO way making any kind of ludicrous state
ment that Professional Wrestling is fake, phony, 
or staged.
Next week at Graffiti: Lyle Mays
PITTSBURGHHearalded for his musical 
compositions and playing with the Pat Metheny 
Group, pianist Lyle Mays is welcomed by 
DiCesare-Engler to Graffiti on Wednesday, 
April 27 at 8 p.m. Bassist Marc Johnson and 
drummer Alex Acuna are featured with Mays.
Mays musical influence began in his northern 
Wisconsin home where he was exposed to 
popular music of the 30s and 40s. While at
tending school at North Texas State, he ap*
peared at the 1975 Wichita Jazz Festival where 
he met guitarist Pat Metheny.
That same year saw Mays recruited by Woody 
Herman as part of his Thundering Herd. He 
later met Metheny again and together formed 
the Pat Metheny Group in 1977 which con
tinues to be one of the brightest improvisational 
bands.
Accompanying Mays will be bassist Marc 
Johnson,, best known as a member of the late
Bill Evans trio, and drummer Alex Acuna who 
has spent the last few years with Weather 
Report.
