Warner Hall tags 'favored candidate
By MICHAEL J. EWEDOSH
Tartan News Editor
Although the leading candidate 
to replace Dr. Richard M. Cyert 
as president of Carnegie Mellon 
has not received a formal offer 
from the Board of Trustees, sev
eral highly-placed administration 
officials say the top candidate has 
been notified that he is at the top 
of the list.
At least one vice president 
thought that an offer had been 
made. To the best of my knowl
edge, we have made an offer that 
I think is appropriate, said Vice 
President for Enrollment William 
Elliott, a member of the Faculty 
Search Committee.
That is not so, said Presiden
tial Search Steering Committee 
Chair Douglas D. Danforth. 
Weve had some serious discus
sions, but no formal offer has been 
made. We have not selected a 
final candidate. As chair of the 
Board of Trustees, Danforth is 
the Board member considered 
most likely to make a formal offer 
to any candidate.
The disagreement follows the 
announcement earlier this semes
ter of a short list of candidates 
for the position that will become 
vacant when Cyert steps down as 
Carnegie Mellon president in 
June. After Cyerts January an
nouncement, two search commit
tees were formed: one composed
of faculty and another of trustees. 
A student search committee was 
formed as a subcommittee of the 
faculty committee. To oversee the 
faculty and trustee groups, a 
steering committee was formed. 
This steering committee will be 
responsible to make a final rec
ommendation to the Board of 
Trustees from the findings of the 
other search groups.
Fetkovich also denied that a 
formal offer was made to any can
didate. We hope were very close, 
said Fetkovich. We hope that 
well make an offer soon.
As far as I know, were still at 
the short list stage, said Student 
Search Committee Co-chair Car
los Franco. To the best of my
photo by Thomas Nichols 
Vice President for Enrollment 
William Elliott.
knowledge, no offer has been 
made.
But there seems to be some disagreement as to exactly what 
constitutes an offer. Thats a 
matter of interpretation, said 
Fetkovich. As a matter of fact, 
there is a person at the top of the 
list. It has been made clear to that 
person that he is at the top of the 
list. A formal offer requires the 
action of the Board of Trustees, 
and to the best of my knowledge, 
no action has been taken by the 
Board. Its conceivable that the 
board has taken such an action 
without my knowledge, but its 
very highly improbable. Some 
people might interpret that as 
being an offer that has been made, 
but certainly no formal offer has 
been made.

Alum arrested 
in copier fraud
By STEWART LEVINE
Tartan Managing Editor
Carnegie Mellon alumnus John Locke was arrested 
on October 13 for the alleged illegal alteration of expired 
copicards that cot}ld have defrauded the University of 
over $200,000.
Locke, a member of the class of 1989, was charged 
with theft of services for the alterations that are claimed 
to have occured while Locke was employed by the 
Universty.
Copicards are magnetically-encoded cards, similar to 
student IDs, which allow cardholders to prepay for a 
fixed amount of copies in library-owned copiers.
Campus Police found the altered cards when a student 
employee of the Engineering and Science library discov
ered senior John Frazzini using a copicard which regis
tered over 90,000 copies. The employee confiscated the 
card and turned it over to Campus Police. Frazzini later 
named Locke as his supplier. Both Locke and Frazzini 
are Sigma Tau Gamma brothers.
Frazzini refused to make any comments to The Tartan 
about the discovery.
Locke, who was an employee of the Instructional 
Technology Center during the 1989-90 academic year, 
also refused to comment on his arrest.
According to the report that was filed with Pittsburgh 
Police, Locke had access to copicard programming equip

NEW YORK  I just crushed 
the computer. World Chess 
Champion Gary Kasparov made 
this analysis after beating his 
opponent, a Carnegie Mellon 
computer called Deep Thought. 
Of the two games played, the 
second ended even more quickly 
than the first.
Kasparov played Deep Thought
Sunday at the New York Acad
emy of Art in Greenwich Village. 
The computer itself remained in 
the engineering lab at Carnegie 
Mellon with three of its creators 
during the match; it competed via 
phone hook-up.
Before the match, Deep Thought 
was heralded by TV chess com
mentator Shelby Lyman as 
clearly the first chess computer 
with the potential to draw blood 
and defeat the world champion.
As it happened, according to 
Edmar Mednis, a chess grand
master commentating for the 
match, Kasparovs biggest prob
lem was to choose which method 
he should use to win.
Kasparov has vanquished all 
challengers since capturing the 
world chess champion title in 
1985. Born in Baku, Azerbaijan, 
in the U.S.S.R., he became an 
international grandmaster at 17,

Tempers flared and controversy 
raged last year when sixty CFA 
students staged a demonstration 
in front of Warner Hall protest
ing the cancellation of the 
Colleges quadrennial Beaux Arts 
Ball.
This year, however, conditions 
are more favorable, as the winds 
of negotiation are blowing in a 
different direction. From present 
indications, the event will return 
in1990. I dont see anybody whos 
against it, said CFADean Lowry 
Burgess. Its just that it has to be 
done the right way.
The Balls revival is occasioned 
by the work of a committee of 
CFAstudents, co-chairedbyTony 
Rothberg and Mariko Braswell. 
After an auspicious turnout at 
the initial meeting between stu
dents and Dean Burgess, a draft 
document of rules and regula
tions was drawn up and pre
sented to Dean of Student Affairs 
Mike Murphy and University 
Attorney A1 Brannick.
Friday, the committee submit
ted the document to the Student 
Affairs Committee, comprised of 
Maryanne Moore, Jim Langli, 
Mike Corletti, Michael Murphy, 
Anne Witchner, Fred Rogers, Ron 
Campana, Tony Martin, and 
William Elliott.
The draft proposal is beinggiven 
the finishing touches in a series of 
final negotiations between stu
dents and administrators. Such
meetings, said Burgess, are to 
insure that every office has the 
proper input into the process. 
According to Dave Schroeder, 
public relations director of the 
student committee, the whole 
meeting was really positive. 
Chief among the reasons for the 
administrations cancellation of 
the ball last year was the extreme 
damage to the College of Fine 
Arts building that occurred dur
ing the 1984 Ball. Assistant Di
rector of Physical Plant Neil Binstock could not recall the exact 
total of all the damages, but said 
that the figure was in the tens of 
thousands of dollars.
In order to prevent a recurrence 
of such a situation, the draft docu
ment calls for a foundational re
structuring of the whole event. 
According to Burgess, the basic 
concept of the Beaux Arts Ball 
itself will undergo fundamental 
changes. Were trying to set a 
tone for the ball as a creative 
event, said Burgess. A celebra
tion of ingenuity, creativity, and 
imagination of the people in CFA
 and to the extent that were 
successful at that, we can very 
much minimize damage thats 
other than accidental things that 
may occur.
Schroeder added that the pro
posal is designed to eliminate 
what he called the problems that 
the university is concerned with: 
damage, over-budgeting, and 
drugs and alcohol. He said that 
the ball itself will be a return to

A professorship has been named for Professor Richard Duffin, 
university professor of mathematical sciences, emeritus. It is the 
first professorship to be named at Carnegie Mellon.
Mathematics Department Head William Williams said the 
professorship was the result of expanding the concept of the as
sistant professorship. In 1980, the first assistant professorship 
was named for Zeev Nehari.
Assistant professorships are named for visiting professors who 
have been at Carnegie Mellon for two or three years. However, 
this year, Carnegie Mellon President Richard Cyert suggested 
expanding this concept and naming a professorship for Duffin. 
The purpose for the professorship is to honor the professor and to 
recognize his commitment to the university.
Duffin has been at Carnegie Mellon since 1946. Duffin retired 
in 1986 but taught part-time the following year. He remains an 
active member of the math department.

Leaders offer 
assistance to 
quake victims
WASHINGTON (AP)  The 
Pope sent prayers and Soviet 
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev of
fered relief aid last week as the 
world expressed grief for the vic
tims of the devastating earth
quake in northern California.
Thousands jammed interna
tional phone lines seeking to get 
in touch with relatives in the area 
hit by Tuesdays quake, which 
was believed to have killed more 
than 270 people, flattened bridges 
and buildings, and started fires 
in the San Francisco Bay area.
Offers of aid came from the 
Philippines, Japan, France, Brit
ain, Switzerland, and several 
other nations.
An estimated 500,000 Filipinos 
live in the San Francisco area, 
one of the largest Filipino com
munities in the world.
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev 
sent condolences in a telegram to 
President Bush today, the Soviet 
news agency Tass said.
A Soviet Foreign Ministry offi
cial said his countrymen under
stand the grief of the Americans 
because of the quake in Armenia 
that killed 25,000 people less than 
a year ago.
Yuri Dubinin, the Soviet envoy 
to Washington, was assigned to 
contact the Bush administration 
to learn what sort of aid could be 
given by the Soviet side, by gov
ernment or social channels, to
wards liquidating the conse
quences of the earthquake, the 
official Tass news agency said.
If the Soviets do help the vic
tims of an American quake, it 
would be the first time the Soviets 
helped the U.S. after a disaster.
Millions of dollars of U.S. assis
tance, along with aid from nu
merous other countries, poured 
into Armenia following the Dec. 7 
quake in the Soviet republic.
A team of four to six British
engineers specializing in 
earthquake safety design will fly 
to San Francisco to help assess 
damage, said a British official.

SAN FRANCISCO (AP)  The 
nations second-deadliest earth
quake ravaged Northern Califor
nia last Wednesday; initial esti
mates were that over 200 people 
were crushed to death in their 
cars, injuring more than 400 
others, caving in highways and 
collapsing bridges. The magni
tude of the quake slowly emerged.
The quake along the notorious 
San Andreas Fault registered 6.9 
on the Richter scale. It hit at 5:04 
pm Pacific time Wednesday, 
stranding thousands of office 
workers downtown as night fell 
over the powerless city.
About 200 people were killed in 
their cars when a half-mile-long 
section of the upper level of Inter
state 880 in Oakland collapsed 
onto the lower level, said Marty 
Boyer, the Alameda County pub
lic information officer.
Reports of damage and injury
grew as officials made contact with 
hard-hit areas, where many tele
phones were cut off. Up to one 
million people were left without 
power.
Several hundred California 
National Guard soldiers were 
being mobilized, including engi
neers, military police, and medi
cal workers, Staff Sgt. Frank 
Jones of the State Military De
partment said in Sacramento.
Willis Jacobs of the earthquake 
center said the quake was cen
tered about eight miles northeast 
of Santa Cruz, or 75 miles south 
of San Francisco, along the San 
Andreas fault. That is the major 
earthquake fault blamed for the 
1906 disaster that destroyed 
much of San Francisco and killed 
thousands.

Bush had threatened a veto

that would tighten requirements 
for such abortions.
White House Press Secretary

U.S. trade gap 
shows no 
signs of letup
NEW YORK (DJ)  The wid
ening of the merchandise trade 
deficit in August suggests that 
improvements in the U.S. trade 
balance are unlikely to happenanytime soon.
The unexpectedly sharp widen
ing in the August trade gap fol
lowed several months of a stead
ily narrowing deficit. The wider 
August trade gap reflected a 6.4 
percent rise in imports and an ().2 
percent drop in exports.
That resulted in a $10.77 tril
lion gap in August, compared witii 
the revised July deficit of $8.24 
billion, which had previously been 
reported as $7.58 billion. The 
consensus estimate for August 
had been for a $9.1 billion deficit.
The August trade report rein
forces the view that, at best, the 
improvement in the trade gap; is 
slowing down, said Daiwa Econo
mist Michael Moran.
He says the August deficit 
overstates the deterioration cii 
the US trade position. He expects 
the monthly deficits of $9 billion 
to $9.5 billion. Were not going to 
be below $9 billion anymore.1

Carnegie Mellons Activities 
Board is currently working to 
... improve the sound quality of films 
held on campus in Doherty Hall 
-,,2210.
AB Treasurer Carlos Franco 
' said that the situation is cur
rently being examined. Accord
ing to Franco, AB has contracted 
"with a consultant to study options available for the current 16 
mm system in use in DH 2210.
At this stage, however, AB is 
unsure what will ultimately be
needed to improve the sound 
quality of the current system. Any 
recommendations from the con
sultant will be implemented next 
semester.
According to AB Friday Films 
Chair Adam Goldsmith, the 
current possibilities may range 
from replacement of some wiring 
to the purchase of a full 35 mm 
projection/sound system. We dont 
want to make any premature 
judgements.
The purchase of a 35 mm sys
tem would also facilitate stereo 
sound. The current 16 mm sys
tem cannot support stereo sound
because 16 mm films are not 
available in stereo.
Goldsmith said that parts of 
the current system, which was 
purchased two years ago, are still 
in good condition. However, he 
said that AB has already at
tempted to make some interim 
improvements in the system as a 
temporary solution until a final 
course of action is determined.
Carnegie Mellon students fre
quent the $1 films shown by AB 
and SDC in DH 2210, which are 
shown from Thursday through 
Sunday each week. Though most 
students are pleased with the
selection of films, there is some 
dissatisfaction with the sound 
quality.
While the movies AB gets are 
pretty good, the sound system 
leaves a lot to be desired, said 
Ernest Litorja, H&SS sophomore.
Goldsmith said that films AB 
receives are often damaged from 
overuse. While the sound qual
ity problems are not caused by 
this exclusively, he said, it is 
not a factor that can be ignored.
AB is searching for funds to 
update the system. According to 
Goldsmith, updating to 35 mm 
could cost more than $80,000.

Search committee members dispute status of offer to lead candidate
Volumle84 nHo9 ,Is8 O
Elliott later clarified his earlier 
statements. There have been 
discussions, he said.  Offer is 
my wrong word, then. Ive talked 
with a couple of candidates  we 
havent talked about an offer by a 
rlong shot, but what we have talked 
about is what they would do if 
. ,;they were to come [here]. If it was 
V. an offer, then thats my term. I 
think the discussion with the 
"candidates was appropriate.
Whether there was an offer or. 
not, I dont know.
When asked questions aboutthe 
specific dandiates, committee 
members refused to elaborate.
I cant answer that question, 
Fetkovich told The Tartan. Some 
of these rumors are right, some of 
them are wrong. Any rumor is at 
least as likely to be wrong as right.
I cant answer that question be
cause it could damage the search 
seriously, whether correct or incorrect information is printed. It 
has been the case that universi
ties searching [for a president] in 
the past have had a favored can
didate withdraw when a leak 
resulted in the publication of his 
name as a candidate.
Another factor cited by the 
committee members in keeping 
the names and status of the can
didates confidential was that 
there are other universities who 
are also searching for a president.

the traditional entertainment/art 
exhibition nature of the event. 
Were rediscovering its initial 
purpose, said Schroeder. The Ball 
, :-will be dry, with no alcohol served 
. or permitted. Its not a situation 
V that anyones even going to care 
:"that there is no alcohol, because 
 its just going to be so absolutely 
 incredible, said Schroeder.
Although most of the specific 
events for the ball are still in the 
-planning stages* Schroeder did 
--give some rough outlines of a few 
,r of the things planned. From pres
ent designs, there will be several 
bands performing, including a 
mystery band whose name will 
not be announced until the ball 
starts. Additionally, there will be 
a costume competition, and ran
dom entertainment, such as 
jugglers, Schroecler said. Finally, 
the event will conclude with a 
breakfast served the following 
morning. As Schroeder described 
it, there will be events going on 
so that the ball is just a continual 
crescendo building up, with every 
hour better than the last.

There are presidential searches 
going on at the MIT and [Johns] 
Hopkins, said Franco.
Fetkovich agreed that the other 
searches were indeed a factor. 
You can well imagine that if you 
look at the list of universities 
conducting searches, he said, 
that some of the candidates are 
such that you can expect [other 
universities] to be looking at some
of the same people we are. 
While a short list of candidates 
for the position does exit, said 
Fetkovich, it is not conclusive. It 
is not actually clearly defined. 
Theres a list of a large number of 
names. At any given time, were 
interested in a few names at the 
top. As time goes on, some drop 
lower, while others raise up. 
Danforth stressed the impor
tance of not narrowing the field of 
candidates down to quickly. Until 
you get down to the short strokes, 
you keep everybody that has the 
capacity to be president in the 
system, he said.
Cyert will remain in his post 
until a successor is appointed by 
the Board. After the next presi
dent takes office, Cyert wishes to 
remain a teacher and fundraiser.
Fridays meeting seems to echo 
Burgesss and Schroeders enthu
siasm.
Whoever came up with the 
idea, I give them lots of credit, 
said Director of Operations Mike 
Corletti. Its very creative.  Its 
just a great way to show every
body  people outside of Fine 
Arts, alumni, and people who are 
there now  what everybodys 
doing in Fine Arts.
Added Burgess, Im confident 
that the students running it are 
working very hard to produce 
something of first class quality.

Fraudulent copicard discovered in E&S
Volumle84 nHo9 ,Is8 O
sible for programming copicards.
At the time of his arrest, Locke also 
possessed copies of keys to rooms in 
Doherty Apartments, two barrel keys for 
the change-storage areas of Savin copi
ers located on campus, and a copicard 
with 99,935 copies on it.
To date, police have recovered 21 al
tered cards, each believed to have been 
altered to register 99,999 copies.
The cards have anonymously arrived 
at Student Affairs through Campus Mail 
over the past four weeks.
Over 10,000 copies had already been 
used from those cards, resulting in a loss
to the University of over $1000. It is 
unknown whether additional altered 
cards exist.
Although cards may be programmed 
for up to 99,999 copies, copicards have 
neither been distributed within the li
brary nor to departments with more than 
1000 copies on them, according to In
structional Technologies Director Joan 
Mitchell.
Such cards do not legally exist, said 
Mitchell. The largest copicards sold by 
the libraries are programmed for 1000 
copies.
Locke waived his pre-trial hearing late 
last week, opting to take his case directly
before an Allegheny County Court.
It is unknown whether Frazzini will be 
prosecuted, or whether other students 
will be found with altered cards. The 
decision to prosecute will be made jointly 
by Instructional Technologies and Cam
pus Police.
Assistant Dean of Student Affairs Ron 
Campana said that he could not com
ment on any disciplinary action being 
taken against any current students.
Mitchell said that Instructional Tech
nologies was consulting the manufac-. 
turer of the copicard equipment to exam
ine ways of making the system more se
cure.

Carnegie Mellons mens cross
country coach Gary Meckley is
sued a statement of protest 
against the site and administra
tion of the Presidents Atheltic 
Conference championship held on 
Saturday at Bethany College due 
to a disregard for the runners 
safety and the violation of several 
NCAA regulations. He intends to 
submit this statement to the di
rector of Division III cross-coun
try championships, Gayle Hunter.
Meckleys complaints, sparked 
by heated arguments with the 
Bethany coach Joe Lessem prior 
to the meet, were that it was dan
gerous for the men to be running 
on the course and that Lessem, 
was unprofessional and showed 
no concern for the runners. He 
felt that Lessem owed apologies 
to all the coaches who particiapted 
in the event.
This course is both rough and 
dangerous, Meckley said in the 
protest, and if we allow our ath
letes to participate in such a race, 
they are undoubtedly led to be
lieve that their welfare is not im
portant to us.
The coaches deliberated for 
hours before the race whether or 
not they should have their run
ners compete. CMU Womens 
Cross Country Coach Dario 
Donatelli boycotted the race be
cause of the conditions of the 
course. Other womens teams did 
compete. The mens coaches left it 
up to the runners and a few min
utes before the race they decided 
to run the race.
Winning is just as important 
to Coach Meckley as it is to us, but 
his concern was for our safety, 
said Co-captain Dave Supp.
In his written statement, Meck
ley, argues the course violated 
ten NCAA regulations, as the PAC 
Code was not followed. Some of 
the violations included improper 
markings along the course, un
safe obstacles such as open man
hole covers, steep inclines, and 
narrow passages. Meckley states
If we allow our athletes to partici
pate in such a race, they are undoubt
edly led to believe that their welfare 
is not important to us. 
 Carnegie Mellon Mens Cross 
Country Coach Gary Meckley
allow them to compete at Nation
als and cannot afford to take this 
week off. Supp agrees that this is 
the reason the team chose to run. 
Along with four top runners for 
CMU, Supp did not run at last 
weeks meet and absolutely 
needed a race. Supp added, After 
driving all the way there along 
with several friends and parents 
that came out for the race, it is
difficult to just back out. It is a 
competition that we look forward 
to.
Meckley also complained that 
Lessem had not arranged to have 
trophies or an awards ceremony 
after the meet. He had no pride 
and no one represented Bethany. 
We can not afford to have people 
like him at the collegiate level. It 
is a privilege to coach young men
and he doesnt deserve it. 
Lessem pointed out that he is-^ 
full-time journalism professor and; 
only coaches part-time. I do not 
take it very seriously. Academic^ 
are more important. He did no^ 
feel that the conference was hi$ 
responsibility. He stated that h& 
asked about the trophies and was 
told that the PAC director was 
responsible for supplying them^(
that there was a large possiblility for serious injury or further 
legal action, and that these prob
lems could have been avoided if 
Lessem had complied with the 
regulations.
Meckley was not alone in his 
opinion of the possible danger of 
the course. Grove City University 
coach John Barr agreed. It was a 
dangerous situation. Some of the 
runners got lost.'The course went 
against local and NCAA 
guidelines.
The only NCAA regulation 
Lessem said he was aware of was 
the course length regulation. I 
do not even have the rule book, 
he said.
Lessem was unaware that any 
other coaches, besides CMUs 
coach, had complaints about the 
course. He claimed that Thiel 
and Washington and Jefferson 
ran at Bethany this season and 
made no complaints.
Barr disagreed. Hes wrong. I 
cant believe that he said that. He 
was very well aware of the con
cerns of the coaches and he was 
obviously upset about it.
CMU co-captains Dave Supp 
and Len ONeal said that it was a 
very dangerous course. It was 
the poorest course that I have 
ever run on in college or high 
school, said Supp. There is no 
way that you can have a meet 
where only one person can pass at 
a time. The course was confusing 
and poorly marked.
Meckley, Barr, Supp, and 
ONeal all expressed relief that 
no one was injured during the 
race.
Lessem defended the course,
which he approved after his team 
set it up. The proof is in the 
pudding  no one got hurt.
The only reason why no one 
got hurt, said Supp, was be
cause we walked through the 
dangerous parts of the course and 
went at a slower pace until the 
finish.
Commenting on the teams his
toric shut-out victory at the PAC, 
Meckely stated They ran a first 
rate race very carefully and intel
ligently and this record can never 
be broken.
Meckley said that the team 
needed a race. They are in con
tention for the regional champi
onships in three weeks which will

Cohen and Hunt prepare for council contest in November
By RHONDA STRUMINGER
Tartan Staflwriter
For the past several months, 
ihe City Council race between 
Democrat Dan Cohen and Repub
lican Mary Caroline Hunt for the 
District 8 seat has been much in 
the news.
Both candidates have taken 
strong stands on the issues of 
rime, economic growth, taxes, 
iind the neighborhoods in District 
8: which consists of Bloomfield, 
friendship, Shadyside, Schenley 
Heights, Point Breeze, Oakland, 
and Squirrel Hill.
The parking situation in the 
area around campus  an issue 
which concerns many CMU stu
dents  has also been addressed 
By both candidates.
But what is this election really 
all about? What are the main 
campaign issues? Who are the 
people behind the hoopla? And 
why should CMU students care?
While the candidates agree on 
the issues, they each have unique 
approaches to solving what they 
gee as the problems of the city.
Crime
Both Cohen and Hunt recog
nize the high incidence of bur
glary as the major crime problem 
in District 8.
Cohensuggests aBurglary Task 
Force to increase police protec
tion in high burglary areas and... 
place more police officials on the 
beat. This increase would come 
from the critical divisions of the 
police department, especially the 
traffic division.
Cohen says that his plan would 
work to increase [the use of| 
investigative techniques, includ
ing taking fingerprints and en
suring that the police track down 
every lead and then inform the
News Analysis
victim of the status of the case. 
His approach, he says, would 
make the [victim] feel that the 
police department is really work
ing on the case.
As a blockwatch captain, Co
hen says he fully supports neigh
borhood involvement with the 
police to help prevent crimes.
Hunt, on the other hand, feels 
the first step in solving crime is to 
keep track of current problems, 
then work on solving them before 
they get out of hand. She wants 
to make sure that the new 
$250,000 Honeywell computer 
purchased by the city last spring 
is effectively utilized to prosecute 
and reduce crime in District 8.
In addition to using the citys 
computer to track crime patterns, 
Hunt says she plans to determine 
holdmonthlyneighborhoodmeetings to listen to my constituents 
ideas, suggestions, and concerns. 
Fighting crime is too important to 
be left to the police alone.
Hunt says she recognizes the 
effectiveness of citizen participa
tion programs like blockwatch and 
fully supports them. Such pro
grams help create positive con
tacts between police and citizens, 
and improve community rela
tions. The abysmal rate of crimesolving is unacceptable, she says.
To implement her solutions, 
Hunt calls for a renewal of beat 
cops, some with dogs, and dis
tributed mini-stations, some on 
wheels, for better availability.
Cohen and Hunt agree that the 
Traffic Division could supply 
much of the trained personnel 
needed to implement their plans, 
because many trainedofficers can 
currently be found working traf
fic lights.
The Economy
Economic growth and taxes 
have been another major issue in 
this campaign.
We are not doing a good enough 
job selling Pittsburgh, Cohen 
says. He supports the creation of 
an Office of Economic Develop
ment to target businesses that 
are seeking to move or relocate, to 
work aggressively to bring them 
to Pittsburgh, and to coordinate 
efforts of economic development 
organizations.
Cohen supports increased 
funding for the Pittsburgh Office 
of Promotion through private 
resources... and is determined to 
help [increase the number] of 
Pittsburgers who have the guts to 
start their own businesses. By 
initiating a Small Business Incu
bator Program, Cohen says he 
will help Pittsburgh entrepre
neurs.
Cohen says he will lower the 
wage tax by shifting the tax 
burden to non-Pittsburghers who 
work in the city... and by fighting 
for revenue sharing from county 
and state governments.
Hunt claims that the wage and 
business taxes have driven work
ers and businesses out of the city, 
causing a decline in the tax base. 
She says that lower taxes will 
eventually attract people and 
businesses to the city, making the 
tax base grow. The more difficult 
problem is balancing the budget 
until then ... and expanding the 
tax base now.
Hunt plans to promote the city 
and to offer broad incentives to 
business which locate here. She 
feels this will be more effective 
than spending large amounts of 
money on a few favored projects, 
as has been done in the past. One 
incentive that Hunt suggests is to 
remove unreasonable obstacles
that inhibit privately funded 
projects such as expensive delays 
and red tape.
It is short-sighted to focus on 
increasing tax revenues, says 
Hunt. City government must 
learn to accept the same economic 
realities that taxpayers face in 
their daily lives. We must be care
ful with our tax dollars and save 
wherever we can without hurting 
city services.... Leaders from our 
businesses and universities in
clude experts who can get maxi
mum benefits from minimum 
expenditures.
Both groups have constructive 
ideas and are willingto help. With 
their input, we can develop budg
ets that reflect the priorities of 
Pittsburgh.
Parking
Cohen and Hunt both favor 
sticker parking and valet park
ing. Sticker parking would give 
residents first priority parking in 
their neighborhoods.
Under this plan, residents 
would be given stickers for their 
cars. Cars parked without stick
ers wouldhave a specified amount 
oftime to move before beingtowed.
In addition, Hunt advocates 
establishing underground park
ing in the Oakland area.
Hunt says she proposed under
ground parking three years ago; 
the city is already planning con
struction of such a facility under 
Soldiers and Sailors Memorial 
Hall in Oakland.
The Candidates
Cohen is an attorney with the 
firm Kirkpatrick and Lockhart. 
He was educated at Yale Univer
sity and Stanford LawSchool. His 
parents live in Shadyside and his 
grandmother lives in Squirrel

Hill. Cohen himself lives in 
Shadyside.
Cohens community experience 
includes co-founding the Demo
cratic Forum of Western Penn
sylvania, serving on the Demo
cratic Committee in the Seventh 
Ward, and acting as blockwatch 
co-captain in Bloomfield.
. Ibelieveinpublicservice,says 
Cohen. I believe government can 
be a catalyst for positive change 
and improve peoples lives. Im 
not running for altruistic reasons; 
rather, its what I love to do.
Hunt has a BS in biology from 
Allegheny College in Meadville; 
she too lives in Shadyside. She is 
a mother of four and wife of Tod 
Hunt, a businessman.
Hunt is a member of the Repub
lican Committee for the Seventh 
Ward, president oftheMorewoodShady side Civic Association, chair 
of the Phipps Conservatory New 
Outdoor Signage, member of the 
Walnut Street Development Task 
Force, and member of The Carne
gie 100, a group that concerns 
itself with the evaluation and 
planningofthe Carnegie museum, 
Carnegie Hall, and the Carnegie
Library.
As a community worker in this 
neighborhood, Ive spent thou
sands of hours working at the 
nitty gritty problems that people 
face every day. Not anything 
glamorous  zoning, parking, 
sewers, that kind of thing, Hunt 
say s. In working with these prob
lems, I became very frustrated at 
the lack of communication be
tween we who live in the neigh
borhoods and the city that seems 
to think it knows all the answers 
to our problems. We can find the 
answers from the people who live 
the problems because they have 
the best ideas.
The Election
The race between Cohen and 
Hunt will end with an election on 
November 7. Skibo is a desig
nated polling place for campus 
residents on the Hill or the 
Eastside as well as parts of Squir
rel Hill; those living in Mudge, 
Morewood, and parts of Oakland 
vote at Central Catholic; and resi
dents of the Clyde Street area 
vote at Rodef Shalom.

In 1782, in the court of Emperor Joseph II, a 
brash young composer named Wolfgang Amadeus 
Mozart set the music world on its car. A radical 
departure from the current fashion in music, 
he set a new standard for style and composition.
It has always been so. The old guard surpassed 
by a new wave. It's true today in the area of 
software tools for IC Design Automation (ICDA). 
Cadence broke with the conventional order to 
create the industrys only completely integrated 
ICDA software solution. Our high-performance 
CAD/CAE tools are coordinated into one har
monious environment, allowing the user to 
arrange the entire IC design process from 
design entry to final verification.
Our approach to integrating the IC design 
process has made Cadence the leader in ICDA 
software. Significantly larger than our nearest 
competitor, we are a financially-secure, fullyresourced company. And we're growing at 70% 
a year. That's twice as fast as the industry average.
The expertise weve acquired by orchestrating 
different elements and helping them to work 
in concert is reflected in our workplace as 
well. At Cadence all team members, veteran 
and recent grad alike, are involved in a crea
tive process infused with intelligence, enthusiasm

Kasparov decisively defeats Carnegie Mellon computer
continued from page 1
the youngest ever to achieve that 
rank with the exception of Ameri
can Bobby Fischer. Kasparov is 
now 26 years old and considered 
'by many to be the greatest player 
of all time.
j Deep Thought was created by 
Carnegie Mellon graduate students Feng-Hsiung Hsu, Thomas 
Anatharaman, Peter Jansen, and 
Andreas Nowatzyk. A fifth mem
ber of the team, Murray Campbell, 
recently became a Computer Sci
ence faculty member.
; The history of Deep Thought 
begins in the summer of 1986, 
with the creation of another 
computer, Chiptest. The Deep 
fThoughtmachine was essentially 
built on our experience with 
Chiptest. Chiptest won the 87 
US Championship, and in May of 
'88, Deep Thought was built on an 
improved structure of it, says 
Anatharaman. One year later, 
Deep Thought went on to win the 
1989 World Chess Championship 
in Edmonton, Canada.
- The computer, rated at 2451 
according to the International 
Chess Federation, compares to 
Pasparov at 2775  just five 
points below the all-time high, 
Bobby Fischers last rating of 
2780. The rating system is based 
>n the average of the total num
ber of rated games played, ex
plained Anatharaman. As a re
sult of some bugs at the beginning 
of Deep Thoughts career, earlier 
failures brought that average 
(lown. We think were about 50 
joints higher than that.
[ Nevertheless,itisgenerally ac
cepted that if Kasparov were to 
play a human grandmaster with 
the same rating as Deep Thought, 
kasporov would win nine out of 
ten games.
; The inner workings of Deep 
Thought include a pair of high 
speed computer chips custom 
designed by Hsu. Also of primary 
importance is the inclusion of an 
endgame data base. This consists 
Sfvarious setpattems with which 
the computer can win the game 
after both players are down to 
only a few specific pieces.
; Deep Thought also incorporates 
a new searching algorithm, known 
las singular extension, which al
lows it to probe as many as 20 
moves ahead, along promising 
tracks of possible chess moves 
rather than conduct a general 
search of all moves imbedded into 
its program. By replaying its 
memory of completed games back
wards, it uses hindsight to learn 
from its previous mistakes.
! Each member of the Deep 
Thought team generally worked 
on his own individual area of ex
pertise, Anatharaman explained. 
Hsu built the hardware, I pro
grammed, Campbell evaluated 
the chess knowledge, Nowatzyk 
designed the automatic tuner, and 
Jansen installed the endgame 
data base, he said.
\ The purpose of the entire proj
ect, according to Anatharaman,. 
Ss You learn how to solve prob
lems in this area of artificial in
telligence. It involves the use of a 
machine to do human tasks withput using human intelligence. I 
Actually think this is preferable, 
because if someday you have a 
robot in your home, you would 
father that it does not have a 
mind of its own. I know I would 
feel more secure if it just does 
whatever it is designed to do, just 
las a dumb machine.
\ Kasporov felt the match was 
important for a different reason. 
[This match is] extremely impor
tant  the image of chess is low 
and it needs this to raise it. This 
match will bring more attention 
to chess than ever, he said. Al

nario where the computer wins.
The team took advantage of the 
match to define problems with 
the computers programming. In 
this area, Campbell felt, [The 
match] was very worthwhile. 
Kasporov is such an excellent 
player, we were able to observe a 
number of problems and define 
them clearly, more so than ever 
before.
In actual game play, Deep 
Thought analyzes the relative 
values ofthe chess pieces depend
ing where they are and what stage 
the game has reached. It has also 
been trained to judge the relative 
merits of differing lines of attack.
Chess pieces move in different 
ways; some are more powerful 
than others. In evaluating indi
vidual pieces, introductory chess 
books rate the pawn at 1, a knight 
or a bishop at 3, a rook at 5 and a 
queen at 9. But a piece may have 
a radically different value depend
ing on its position relative to other 
pieces, and it is necessary for Deep
Thought to accurately evaluate 
the conditions. This was one of its 
problems that became clear dur
ing the match.
The fine-tuning of Deep 
Thought involved the moves of 
900 games played by human 
grand masters and the next lower 
class, international masters. The 
computer analyzed the plays of 
these experts, figuring out the 
relative values of various pieces 
in various positions. In essence, 
Deep Thought was taught by the
best players in the world.
Deep Thought has accom
plished m any things on its road to 
its match with Kasparov. In 1988, 
another Carnegie Mellon com
puter, Hitech, became the first 
computer ever to beat a human 
grandmaster. Later that same 
year, Deep Thought beat Hitech.
Among the computers human 
victims is Bent Larsen of Den
mark, the worlds 96th-ranked 
player, with a rating of 2295. He 
became the first grandmaster to 
fall victim to Deep Thought. 
Robert Byrne, with a rating of 
2465, became the second. Last 
Thanksgiving, in the competition 
with Larsen, Deep Thought lost 
its only other game with a grand
master but went on to tie for first 
place in the event, the first time a 
computer had shared the top prize 
in a mixed field of humans and 
machines.
In addition, Deep Thought won
the Fredkin Intermediate Prize 
for Computer Chess, a $10,000 
award for the first computer to 
reach international master status. 
In 1981 the first Fredkin Prize for 
achieving master status was given 
to a pair of scientists from Bell 
Laboratories. Yet to be claimed is 
another Fredkin prize- $100,000 
to the computer program that 
beats the reigning international 
grandmaster.
Hsu, Campbell, and Anathar
aman will continue with the pro
gram at IBM where the next 
generation is planned , the one 
that they hope will beat the world 
champion.
Anatharaman speculated on the 
Deep Thought ofthe future. Deep 
Thought searches 720,000 chess 
positions per second now and will 
have to search about 1 billion per 
second. Also, the heuristic search 
of the computer has to be im
proved.

Drug-loan law discriminates
In an effort to fight the war on 
drugs, Congress has decided that 
in order to borrow money from the 
government, students must sign 
a statement declaring they will 
not engage in the use, manufac
ture, or sale of controlled sub
stances.
Although the law is attempting 
to address a serious problem, it is 
severely misguided.
The problem is that the law hits 
students twice where other people 
are only punished once. Not only 
do they face the standard penal
ties if convicted of drug-related 
offenses; now they will lose all 
future student loans and will be 
required to repay the ones they 
already hold upon conviction. 
Considering the average loanholders financial situation, re
quiring immediate repayment of 
a loan is tantamount to forcing a 
defaultand hence the convicted 
drug user faces even further legal 
penalties.
Clearly, Congress new law dis
criminates on the basis of wealth. 
Students who must borrow money 
in order to attend college face a 
harsher penalty than their richer 
counterparts.
Besides, the law is generally in
effective. Because it comes into 
play only after a drug conviction, 
it is enforceable only in conjunc
tion with already-existing drug 
enforcement. If enforcement laws 
are insufficient, Congress should 
enact tougher ones which apply 
equally to all offenders.
We recognize the seriousness of 
the drug problem. Unfortunately, 
the new law is not effective in the 
war on drugs. Instead, our gov
ernment could concentrate its 
financial resources and work to 
eliminate the basic social prob
lems such as poverty, low self
esteem, and lack of opportunity 
which cause people to turn to 
drugs. Alternately, it could di
rectly address the drug use prob
lem by providingbetter treatment 
for addicts.
But either strategy requires 
funding, and our legislators in 
Washington would rather throw 
cheap, highly visible threats at 
college students than attack the 
real problem.
Ironically, President Bush touts 
education'as the key to winning 
the drug war  but the new law 
denies some of those struggling 
with drug addiction access to that 
very education.

Women have a right to choose 
an abortion. The set of restric
tions proposed by Representative 
Steven Freind, which the Penn
sylvania General Assembly will 
jtake up today, is an unacceptable 
intrusion into the right of per
sonal choice. It is beingintroduced 
as a rider on a highly popular bill 
concerning child rape that is likely 
to pass.
But before the vote, wed like to 
address several major flaws in 
Freinds rider:
Sex-selection abortions. Roe 
vs. Wade has been interpreted to 
say that the reasons a woman has 
an abortion are just as much a 
part of her right to privacy as her 
sexual preference. Aside from that, 
the riders prohibition of sex-se
lection abortions is totally unen
forceable. Who is going to deter
mine why a woman is having an 
abortion?
Spousal notification. This re
striction is riddled with exceptions 
which render it meaningless. 
Notification is waived for a num
ber of reasons: fear of physical 
harm from the husband, inability 
to locate the husband, a report of

spousal rape, and a claim from the 
woman that her husband is not 
the father. There is really no point 
to this requirement, because even 
if a woman is required to notify 
her husband, his consent will not 
be necessary; in addition, if the 
husband is opposed to the abor
tion, notification could cause 
domestic problems.
Twenty-four hour waiting 
period. Under the riders provi
sions, women would be required 
to wait 24 hours after first meet
ing with a doctor before having an 
abortion. Clinics would have to 
have state-provided information 
about the procedure available if 
the woman asked to see it. In no 
other medical procedure is this 
restriction necessaiy. All one must 
do for a heart transplant is sign a 
waiver. Why the special treatment 
for a much simpler procedure?
All of these restrictions add up 
to simple harassment of the 
woman in an attempt to dissuade 
her from an abortion. While an 
abortion is a controversial medi
cal procedure, it is one that we feel 
should remain a womans personal 
choice.
Editor:
Theres a debate raging in our nation 
about something I consider to be undebatable. The debate boils down to who 
owns womens bodies. Do women own 
their bodies and their uteruses, or are 
they government property? Is a womans 
body her own, or is it owned by her 
husband? Is a womans body her own, or 
the Catholic Church hierarchys? Is it 
she, the woman, who gets to decide 
something as intensely personal as 
whether or not to continue a pregnancy, 
or do politicians get to make the deci
sion?
All major health-care organizations in 
the U.S. support legal abortion. These 
include: American Medical Association, 
American College of Obstetricians and 
Gynecologists, American Academy of 
Pediatrics, and American Psychiatric 
Association. Abortion is far safer than 
childbirth and has drastically reduced 
the maternal mortality rate.
Despite anti-abortion claims to the 
contrary, most abortions occur very early 
in pregnancy, months before viability. 
In Pennsylvania, 93.6 percent occur in 
the first trimester, when the embryo 
weighs less than an ounce. Less than one 
percent occur in the last trimester.
Over 825,000 women have had safe 
legal abortions in our state. Many dont 
remember the days when the word 
choice meant compulsory pregnancy or 
risky, illegal abortion. Unless Pennsyl
vanians make their voices heard a 
womans most personal decision will be 
dictated by politicians.
Our state legislature has 253 mem
bers, 236 of whom are men. In essence 
the decisions about womens lives will be 
made by a group of male politicians who 
will never experience pregnancy, child
birth, or the anxiety of a late or missed 
menstrual cycle.
Letters to the Editor
Since many women have men in their 
lives who love and respect them, its hard 
to imagine that there are men who would 
sacrifice womens lives, purportedly so 
that a fertilized egg might continue to 
develop. The reality is, however, that 
most Pennsylvania legislators couldnt 
care less about the abortion issue, nor do 
they have obsessive concern for the fer
tilized egg, embryo, or fetus. Most legis
lators vote anti-abortion because they 
lack the backbone to stand up to Opera
tion Rescue type fanatics or the pres
sures of a particular religious group.
Others such as Representative Stephen 
Freind  who last year erroneously 
stated that it was impossible for women 
to become pregnant due to rape because 
in the stress of the rape a woman se
cretes a certain secretion which tends to 
kill the sperm, and who stated during 
debate on a spousal rape bill that I dont 
rape my wife, I pay her each time can 
only be described as bullies hostile to 
womens interests.
Every advocacy organization for 
women in the state supports keeping 
abortion safe and legal. Advocacy organizatons also support contraceptive 
use and sex education in schools, so that 
unwanted pregnancies will be prevented. 
Ironically, many opposed to abortion do 
not. Freind has a bill (H.B. 1630), with 86 
sponsors, that would make sex educa
tion difficult and costly for schools to 
offer. It would also prevent eliciting in
formation concerning mental and 
psychological problems that are poten
tially embarrassing to the student or his 
family  a category into which child 
molestation, abuse, and incest usually 
fall.
The fact is Freind doesnt care if women 
are impregnated by rape or incest. He 
doesnt care if they are too old or too 
young to give birth. He doesnt, care if 
they cant emotionally or financially 
support a child. He doesnt care if they 
have cancer, or some other catastrophic 
disease. The fact is he just doesnt care 
about womens lives, and those who vote 
with him dont care.
Votes against legal abortion demand 
that women cease the use of their brains, 
ignore their health, their responsibili
ties and financial and emotional status 
to bear children regardless of the cir
cumstances in their lives. Such votes 
force women to mimic the behavior of 
animals, who bear young whether or not 
conditions are favorable.
There is no law in our nation that 
compels a person to give blood or a body 
organ to sustain the life of another. Yet 
extremists would use the law to compel a 
woman to sustain the life of a fertilized 
egg. Controlling and dominating women 
is the real issue at hand. It isnt respect 
for life that would force a woman to 
sustain a pregnancy  its misogyny. 
Its impossible to purport concern for the 
fertilized egg while callously ignoring 
the life of the woman who carries it.
Freind appears to view women as noth
ing more than receptacles for mens sperm 
and incubators to any pregnancy that 
results from a sexual union, including 
those caused by rape and incest. One 
section of Freinds newest Abortion 
Control Act is designed to protect a 
Fathers right to procreate within a 
marriage  a phrase that is in direct 
conflict with the law that makes spousal 
rape a crime.

Editor:
Jen Bannan and Joe Mertz missed the 
point. I did not condemn feminism or 
women in my letter to The Tartan 
[Balletbo obsessed with domination of 
women 10/6].
In that letter I condemned Jen Bannan. I did not attack the protest in Spain 
or Balletbos lecture, I attacked Bannans 
interpretation of them. Once again, 
Bannan and Mertz have discriminated 
by ignoring the individual and by per
sonifying groups of men and women.
In Bannans narrow-sighted effort to 
attack men, she completely reinter
prets A Clockwork Orange. I attended 
the movie at 6 pm, and it was unusually 
quiet. Sure, I enjoyed the nudity, but do 
not accuse me of glorifying in the degra
dation of women. I did not. I, like I
presume most of the relatively silent 
viewers, was disturbed by the amount of 
violence. A friend of mine attending the 
8:30 pm showing said it was much row
dier at Animal House the following night. 
I dont get it. Why would men be row
dier at Animal House when there were 
no penis-sculpture-fu, or rape, or oldman-being-beaten-up scenes?
As for Joe Mertz, I feel sorry for that 
guy. When Bannan describes women 
protesting, women at the lecture, and 
men enjoying themselves at A Clock
work Orange .poorJoeis being lumped in 
with the rest of us brutes. I guess no one 
like Joe Mertz attended the Balletbo 
lecture; after all, Bannan only describes 
women at the lecture. I guess there are 
no Joe Mertzes in Spain either; after all, 
no men supported the women, they
all clapped when that symbol of mascu
linity, the sleazy employer, won. I guess 
all the Joe Mertzes were at the movie; 
after all, Bannan uses the movie as an 
attack on men.
So tell me, Joe, what was a nice, caring 
guy like you doing enjoying yourself at a 
women degradation flick like A Clock
work Orange?
Oh, and a parting shot. Maybe I did not 
submit to the Student Union because I 
did not want to get the Phil Morgan 
treatment. This poor guy writes a letter 
to the Student Union, and because Ban
nan is an editor, she gets to see his letter 
and write a counterargument for it in the 
same issue. Pretty low, if you ask me.

This was a letter that I was going to 
present at the coaches meeting prior to 
the PAC Championship meet at Bethany 
College; however,the host schools coach, 
Joe Lessum, wouldnt allow me.
Please consider this statement an offi
cial protest against the site and admini
stration of this Championship event. A 
championship event is something spe
cial; to be challengingnot dangerous. 
This course is both rough and danger
ous. To allow our athletes to participate 
in such a race, undoubtedly leads them 
to believe that their welfare is not important to us. There is nothing more impor
tant to a coach than his runners health 
and welfare.
I believe our athletes should not run 
this course for the following reasons :
1.The course is in violation of eight 
separate NCAA rules for cross country.
2. The PAC Code was not followed.
3. The course is too rough  leaving 
open the increased possibility of serious 
injury to an athlete. This could further 
produce legal actions.
4. The Administration of the course 
has proven itself, by its action, to have 
complete disregard for the athletes
welfare.
I propose at this meeting of coaches 
that we do not allow our athletes to 
participate on this particular course, but 
to allow them to run on a road over 5 
miles for the men and 3.1 miles for the 
women.
This action will not only provide for a 
more favorable and safe condition for the 
athletes, but will show our athletes that 
their welfare is important to us as 
coaches.

Racist parents can learn a lot from their kids
I read a story in the newspaper 
last week which upset me because 
it shows how backwards and 
closed-minded some people in this 
country still are. In its own way, 
however, it also offers hope that 
things may not always have to be 
this way.
A high school football game in 
Mississippi was nearly cancelled 
last Friday because the parents 
and administrators at one of the 
schools objected to the fact that 
the other team had a black player.
East Holmes Academy, an allwhite school in Mississippis 
North Central Conference, an
nounced three weeks ago that it 
would forfeit its game against 
Heritage Academy, another high 
school in the same conference. A 
third school in the conference, 
Sharkey-Issaquena Academy, 
forfeited its game against Heri
tage earlier this season.
The reason for these cancella
tions was that Heritage Academy
Jonathan Levy
has a 15-year-old running back 
named Scott Fuller. He is black. 
He is the first black student ever 
to play in the North Central 
Conference. The conference is 
made up of private schools which 
were created in the 1960s to allow 
white parents to send their chil
dren to segregated schools after 
the federal courts ordered the 
integration of the Mississippi 
public schools.
The majority of schools in the 
conference are still predominately 
white, but there are a few black 
students, such as Fuller.
When the cancellation of the 
East Holmes game was an
nounced, I am happy to say that 
there was a certain amount of 
objection from the community. 
Two members of East Holmes 
board of directors resigned and 
Heritages headmaster and Coach
Ray Wooten stood firmly behind 
Fuller and refused to let him quit 
the team when he offered to do so 
in order to end the controversy.
However, the part of the story 
which pleases me most and gives 
me hope for the future concerns 
the actions of the East Holmes 
football players. Twenty-four of 
the 28 players acknowledged that 
what the school was doing was 
wrong and threatened to quit the 
team unless the administration 
reversed itself. When the school 
did not back down, seven of the 
players walked out of practice and 
missed East Holmes game two 
weeks ago. The seven players 
decided to return only after the 
school relented and agreed to play 
the game against Heritage.
That game was played Friday 
and Heritage won 7-0. Despite 
fears of other conflicts and prob
lems, the game was played with
out incident.
I wish I were in a position to
give these seven players an award 
for their actions. They are the 
reason why this twisted story 
might, in some ways, be consid
ered positive.
Some adults in Mississippi may 
still be clinging to prejudice and 
bigotry, but I know that, eventu
ally, they will die off. The impor
tant thing is that their children 
are breaking away from the sort 
of ignorant mindsets which cause 
people to refuse to associate with 
other people because of the color 
of their skin, or for that matter 
because of their sex, religion, or 
sexual orientation.
This fact is what gives me hope 
that what happened at East 
Holmes may be the last desperate 
gasp of dying bigotry, rather than 
the continuation of a permanent 
cycle.

The winds of change are sweep
ing over Europe, and a new phase 
in geopolitics is emerging. As a 
nation, what do we do? Our choices 
appear, and we face a fork in the 
road. We either continue in the 
footsteps of what once was Cold 
War diplomacy, or embark on a 
new and more challenging path of 
international relations.
As a nation that once held a 
paramount position in world af
fairs, we see that our influence is 
no longer as dominant as it once 
was. Changes are sweeping 
throughout the world. To know 
what these changes are, one needs 
only to look at the front page of a 
newspaper. For one thing, the 
Iron Curtain is coming down and 
opening up to Western ideals.
For example, there is a mass 
exodus of East Germans to the 
West. In the past, we saw East 
Germans fleeing to West Ger
many while evading troops and 
guard dogs, finally to scamper 
across the Berlin Wall! Now we 
see it done legally. The East Ger
man government has no means to 
stop its people from pursuing free
dom except using brute force, for 
which, I feel, we should carefully 
watch in order to avoid a recur
rence of the Tiananmen Square 
massacre. But the events in East 
Germany are not the only in
stance of change occurring in 
Europe.
Hungary, a nation which can be
Dave Schwartz
labeled the most free of the Iron 
Curtain nations, has declared it
self a Socialist, rather than Com
munist, nation. Even though the 
ideology remains pretty much the 
same, the fact that Hungary has 
challenged the mighty Soviet 
empire is remarkable in itself. 
The Hungarians have not taken 
this type of stance since the So
viet crushing of the freedom re
volts in 1956. This series of events 
is spreading.
For the first time in over 40 
years, Poland has elected a non
communist government! Solidar
ity has now become the major 
party in Poland. With these re
markable reforms it is safe to say 
that the Cold War has taken a 
new twist. So what should the 
U.S. do? Do we simply sit idly by 
and watch the changes sweep 
across Eastern Europe?
The U.S. should take the initia
tive and do its utmost to support 
the changes. President Bush and 
those in Congress should care
fully and cautiously support Po
land with economic aid. As for 
Hungary, there should be more 
economic support. However, I 
stress the fact that these meas
ures must be implemented with a 
great deal of diplomacy and care, 
because if we react too fast, our 
actions may backfire and, in es
sence, quell the reforms that we 
see. If these measures are suc
cessfully implemented, the Sovi
ets will not be happy.
How is the Soviet Union re
sponding to these changes? Since 
the Soviets are facing a great deal 
of internal strife, such as the 
ethnic violence in Azerbaijan, the 
mine workers strikes in central 
Russia and the Baltic States re
volt, their attention has been 
shifted.
Gorbachev wants East Ger
many to handle its own problems. 
As for Hungary, the Soviets have 
little influence on internal policy. 
Mind you, the Soviets retain a 
tight grasp on the military, and 
by no means will they relinquish 
this power. Anew period of change 
is approaching.
We are now entering a new 
period in history in which change 
and reform are the key elements 
to the global picture. In order for 
our nation to function well under 
these changes, the U.S. should 
institute a new foreign policy in
volving the support of reformed 
East Bloc nations.
With these measures we should 
remain cautious and observant 
as to what the Soviets do. We can 
not ignore the Soviets and believe 
that they will lie dormant, for 
they have a great deal at stake 
here. Indeed, we must adapt to

My parents anniversary is 
this month, and finding gifts for 
them is not easy. My dad works 
in a mens clothing store, so it is 
a little silly to buy him a tie. 
Both have different interests, 
so finding one present for both 
of them has always been tough.
Many times, I would buy the 
nicest present I could afford 
which would stay stashed away 
for a year or two until it was discovered in the non-annual 
spring cleaning. Can I help it if 
I forget we already owned two 
sets of every Barbara Streisand 
album? I have never had much 
luck in finding them the perfect 
gift. I once made an ashtray, 
but by the time it was perfected, 
my dad had quit smoking.
I know that my parents dont 
really want or need an expen
sive gift. What means the most 
to them is something I make for 
them, whether it be burnt cook
ies or a useless ashtray. Things 
made by my own hands are what 
they seem to appreciate the 
most. Unfortunately, I was not 
blessed with any artistic talent. 
I try my best, however, to make 
use of what creative faculties I 
do possess. I remember my
mothers favorite present was a 
poem I wrote for her for Mothers 
Day in 1983. It is still hanging 
in our family room.
This year, my parents will be 
coming here for Parents Week
end, which is the same week
end as their anniversary. I dont 
intend to buy anythingforthem, 
unless it is some material with 
which I can make their gift. But 
I think that seeing me is going 
to be gift enough. No, I am not 
being conceited  this year is 
the first year that both my sis
ters and I are away from home.
There has always been a lot of 
pressure on me to do well or to 
do the best I could. I think they 
will be very glad to see just how 
well I am doing, knowing that 
there were a lot of obstacles for 
me to overcome on my own. Ill 
take them to a nice restaurant, 
and show them the sights by 
night. I will tell them all my 
great news, and how happy I 
am here. They are happy when 
I am. They tell me that things 
that make them happy are the 
real presents in their lives.
Happy anniversary, Mom and 
Dad. I cant wait to see you and 
give you your gift.

Every two years I put out a new 
book and then make a tour of the 
talk shows plugging it. I cant do 
it any more because this year its 
impossible for someone who is not 
really weird to get on TV.
I discovered this when I walked 
into Lisa Johnsons office at 
Putnams and she said, Ive never 
heard anything so ridiculous in 
my life. The people at Phil 
Donahues say they are very sorry 
but they cant put you on the show 
unless you have a sex-change 
operation.
I laughed, Thats a good one. 
She wasntlaughing. She looked 
at me and said, Well pay for it. 
Now Lisa, you know that Im 
not going to have a sex-change 
operation just to sell a few books. 
Thats your decision, but youll 
never make the best-seller lists 
as a man, she said.
What about Oprah Winfrey? 
Wetalkedtoherproducer. This 
month theyre only doing people 
who were physically abused by 
their pets when they were kids. 
I had a dog who once bit me on 
the ankle. Any bulletins from 
Geraldo Rivera?
On his upcoming show hes 
featuring inmates who learned to 
cook key lime pie on Death Row. 
Count me out. Im sorry Mor
ton Downey Jr. is no longer on the 
air. I would have thrown a chair 
at him.
Lisa said, Its an entirely dif
ferent ball game this year. Every
one is in the ratings game and 
you have to be really far out to get 
on a show. Maury Povich, who 
used to be a great interviewer, 
will not have you on his program 
unless youve had kinky corre
spondence with a fax machine. 
What about the local shows? 
Theyre no better. Youre not 
going to get a plug on TV unless 
youre wanted by the FBI.
It doesnt seem fair. Perhaps I 
could confess to a yearning to jog 
nude with the bears in Yellow
stone National Park.
Lisa sounded harassed. Our 
job is not to bemoan the state of 
affairs of talk TV, but to do some
thing about it. We have to fulfill 
their production needs.
I cant become a werewolf. 
Maybe not, Lisa agreed, but I 
had atip that JoanRivers is doing 
vampires who use steroids.
By this time Lisa was in tears. 
How can I possibly getyou on TV 
if your father wasnt even an 
Estonian war criminal?
I tried to reassure her. The sex 
change sounds the easiest, but I 
wont have it unless they promise 
to give me the full hour on Do
nahue.
Hell only take you with Bar
bara Walters.
Is she going to have a sexchange operation, too?
She has to if shes got a book 
coming out.

abortion. Yetwhenmiscarriages 
occur early in pregnancy, society 
doesnt treat the miscarried re
mains as persons. Typically there 
are no death certificates issued, 
no burial, no church service and 
no funeral home visitations for an 
emhryo or fetus.
Thisnationhas 36,000 children 
available for adoption. When 
Freind was asked by Delaware 
County NOW to put his money 
where his mouth is, he responded 
that he was doing his very best to 
adequately support his six chil
dren, and that his anti-abortion 
stance in no way obligates him 
to adopt one.
Letters to the Editor
What would happen if Freind, 
and others who vote against legal 
abortion, were compelled to adopt 
by a law that provided no excep
tions? It would not matter if legis
lators were struggling to ade
quately care for the children they 
already have, suffered from a 
debilitating or catastrophic dis
ease, preferred to remain child
less, were unmarried, too old, too 
young, ill-equipped for parent
hood, ready to retire, had an alco
hol or drug problem, lacked funds 
for the food, housing and clothing
necessary to raise a child.
Perhaps, debating the merits 
of such a law would force legisla
tors to realize that parenthood is 
much too serious a commitment 
and obligation to force on any 
unwilling person, be it a state 
legislator or a woman faced with 
an unwanted pregnancy. As a 
parent of three, a former foster 
parent and a childcare provider. 
Children should be wanted and 
loved, and that there should be 
strong commitment to seeing 
that a childs needs are met.
Legislators who vote against 
legal abortion must be told that 
they are at odds withmainstream 
opinion on the issue. As passion
ately as I and other leaders in the 
womens movement feel about 
womens lives we cannot win this 
fight alone. We need everyone who 
cares about womens lives and the 
lives of our daughters to speak up, 
and contact their state legislators
 tell them that a vote to keep 
abortion safe, legal, and accessible 
is a vote that saves womens lives.
Freind has indicated that he will 
pass his restrictive abortion law 
by October 23, so everyone who 
cares about womens lives needs to 
speak up now, before its too late.

I would like to formally acknowl
edge and thank the many people 
that made National Coming Out 
DaynnOctoberll asuccess. With 
the events that occurred on cam
pus, a significant social and politicalimpactwasmade. Whether 
it was in a classroom, over the 
dinner table, walking down the 
sidewalk, or atthe tables in Skibo, 
people were talking about gay/ 
lesbian/bisexual issues. Some 
people got angry and upset, as 
was demonstrated by the defac
ing of the fence. (Incidentally, the 
slogans in blue spray paint on the 
fence were done in reaction to the 
defacing and are in support of gay 
rights; this fact was not made 
clear in the caption of The 
Ta*tans photograph last week.) 
Others visibly showed their sup
port and concern. I am grateful to 
those who wore pink triangles to 
show their support, even though 
they were anxious about the reac
tions they might have received 
from friends.
In particular, I would like to 
thank Amy Ginther, assistant 
director of Housing, and Cindy 
Sammons, area coordinator, for 
supporting an in-service for RAs 
regarding the support of resi
dents with gay/lesbian/bisexual 
concerns, and for providing funds 
for postering and the pink tri
angle buttons; the RAs, for their 
support in putting posters up in 
the residence halls; Jill Moore 
and the Political Speakers Forum 
Board for providing the funds for 
The Times of Harvey Milk; mem
bers of GALA, for their support in 
painting and guarding the fence
(especially Matt, J., P., I., and 
Michael and his amazing fencepainting device); Nathan Long, 
for doing the radio show on 
WRCT on Wednesday afternoon; 
everyone who sat at tables in 
Skibo  Teresa Campbell and 
Roslyn Hall of the Housing Of
fice, Eric, Michael, Matt, and N.; 
all those on the panel on Wed
nesday night  Nathan, J., N., 
and S.; the Student Union, for 
the topical series of articles; The 
Tartan, for interviewing me for 
NCOD; everyone who wore a pink 
triangle; and everyone who at
tended a National Coming Out 
Day event or even supported 
NCOD in any other way. Your 
vocal, visible support has vali
dated we who are lesbian, gay, or 
bisexual, and has encouraged up 
to have the courage to be open
about who we are. You are appreci
ated.
I would like to extend an open in
vitation to those who feel strongly 
about bisexual/lesbian/gay issues 
to participate in a dialogue. 
Whether it take the form of letters 
to the editor, speakers, demonstra
tions, or individual conversations 
with others, I invite you to partici
pate in creating awareness.
Tolerance and respect for all 
human being occurs in a conversa
tion a conversation for the possi
bility of the citizens of our planet 
working with and in support of 
each other, regardless of their dif
ferences; a conversation for peace. 
The conversation begins with you 
and me.

As a young, Jewish, female col
lege student, I have always fa
vored Democratic candidates to 
holdjjolitical offices, especially if 
ttiev,are Jewish.
For my professional writing 
claseach candidate District 8 
for City Council came and spoke.
Dan Cohen comes off as a knock 
out.Hes total Kennedy mate
rial. lie has charm, confidence, 
good looks, and the hearts of at 
.east half the citys female popu
late, His appearance seems to 
portray an over powering domi
nance. What a hame, for within 
Mary Caroline Hunts petite 
frame hides extreme dignity, ex
perience, common sense and 
steadfast commitment. However, 
these qualities can not be read on 
first ight. How can they be? What 
do experience and commitment 
looklike? Are they short or tall, 
loudor soft, gold or gray? Appear
ance and tone can be deceptive.
After listening to both, I knew 
who tlie best candidate would be,
Mary Caroline Hunt. But I am 
concerned that the public would 
be blinded, as well as deafened, 
by misleading first impressions.
Voters are often biased and 
blinded by a candidates charm 
and character. Think back upon 
childhood circus shows. Remem
ber the clowns who helped us 
forget lifes toils? With colorful 
and happy faces, worries were 
hidden and problems were pushed 
aside. However, we never actu
ally saw what happened when 
their show was over. Masks and 
makeup were taken off to expose 
ordinary faces, like yours and 
mine. They too were only human. 
In reality, no one contains any 
mystifying or magical ingredient 
to instantaneously cure all prob
lems. However, a good perform
ance can be extremely deceptive, 
especially in the caBe of a political 
campaign.
Unfortunately, most voters 
dont have the adequate time or 
knowledge to make the right 
choice (if they even bother to make
one at all). One may be commit
ted to a particular party, race, 
gender, style, or even religion. 
Often, real issues are painted 
over or even painted up. Al
though Hunt discussed issues at 
center stage, she was no Marga
ret Thatcher or Roseanne Barr. 
She wasnt an attention grabber 
and did not portray a dictating 
woman ofthe 90s character. Soft 
spoken tones carried her voice. 
However, as I listened to this 
humble woman, I realized its 
not the weight of the voice or the 
body mass that should carry a 
candidate. Rather, its issues that 
are weighted with logic and sin
cere concern for the community 
and individual.
Mary Caroline Hunt is a 
member of this community. As a 
matteroffact, shes an extremely 
active fourth generation mem
ber. Shes informed and very 
aware of her citys needs. But 
more important, she feels them. 
People should know that Mary 
Caroline Hunt will remain in
the neighborhood a long Ctim e after 
the council term is up. Doyou think 
that District 8 needs a knight in 
shining armor likelytorideoff into 
the sunset?
Mary Caroline Hunt has been 
one dedicated woman. She has been 
President of Morewood-Shadyside 
Civic Association, a member of the 
Walnut Street Development Com
mittee, committee woman of the 
Seventh Ward, on the Board of 
Trustees for Winchester-Thursten 
School and Allegheny College, and 
a fourth generation of District 
Eight. Not only has this busy 
woman been devoted to her hus
band and children, but she cares 
about what she calls all my children.Shesonfire! However,shes 
not a short lived sparkler on top of 
a pretty, iced birthday cake. Mary 
Caroline Hunt is a packed stick of

Let me tell you about my room
mate  Sue Abrams. Shes an 
H&SS freshman, planning to 
majorinprofessional writing with 
a minor in visual communications. 
In high school, she was a member 
of the National Honor Society. 
She graduated in the top one 
percent of her class. In the Coca 
Cola Scholarship Competition, 
she was named a National 
Scholar. She made As in both of 
the summer classes she took at 
CMU. Currently, she is an assis
tant editor of the Forum section 
and a columnist for The Tartan. 
She is also hearing impaired.
When I read Sues column last 
week [Those who believe in stere
otypes are truly deaf, 10/17] my 
first reaction was Bravo, Sue, 
you finally let them know how 
you feel, you finally told them 
off. Now people may wonder 
exactly who they are and what 
they did to make Sue want to 
tell them off. They are people 
who:
1)Talk to me when they meet 
Sue and I together, and expect me 
to translate or something.
2)Whisper or mumble and then 
become rude because they think 
Sue is ignoring them.
3) Shout at Sue instead of speakingto her, because after all, wont 
she hear me if I speak louder?
4) Become offended if Sue says

What? or asks them to repeat 
something, because they think she 
isnt listening to them.
Ill admit that when I first met 
Sue, I wasnt quite sure how to - 
handle the situation. But over the 
past couple months, I have learned 
that some common courtesy, a 
little patience, and plain old ac
ceptance work wonders. Sue isnt 
stupid  she has accomplished a  
great deal, as exemplified by the 
list at the beginning of this letter.
So if youve ever met Sue or ever 
happen to meet her (or anyone 
like her), dont look atthe hearing 
aid. Look at the person. Get to 
know her.
If you want Sue to know some
thing, tell her. When you speak, 
take your time and enunciate 
clearly. Be patient if she asks you 
to repeat something. With a little 
effort, youll make friends with 
someone who has a great person
ality and an outrageous sense of 
humor (read her column some
time).
Sues hearing impairment 
doesnt make her different or 
special or any of those other 
nice words people use to de
scribe those who have a handi-: 
cap. Sue is special, but because of 
the person she is, not because of 
her handicap. At least I think so.

Granted, the crime rate at CMU 
is probably not uncharacteris
tic of an urban university, but 
there are some questions that can 
be raised as to how safe we are 
here. In no way do I mean to 
criticize either the city or campus 
police, its just that theyve really 
got their work cut. out for them. 
How is this going to affect our 
school and its students in the long 
run? It would be very interesting 
to see how our crime rate com
pares with that of other schools.
Crime generally occurs as a 
solitary act, but it often affects a 
significantly larger group. One 
that immediately comes to mind 
is the incident at Mudge when a 
master key was stolen. If not 
handled as quickly and efficiently
Letters to the Editor
as it had been, a single mischie
vous act that could have had some 
serious repercussions for the resi
dents.
There are also crimes against 
students like assaults and rapes 
that are not always committed by 
first-time offenders or at least 
there are recognizable patterns. 
A female student at Point Park 
College was assaulted in front of 
her residence on Dawson Street 
in Oakland by Paul R. Jones, 23, 
a second-year law student at Pitt. 
He demanded her money while 
holding a knife to her throat and 
forced her upstairs to her apart
ment. Fortunately, Jones was 
frightened by some neighbors and
made his escape through their 
closed bedroom window. The po
lice alerted all hospitals and Jones 
was arrested while being treated 
for cuts. It had been his second 
assault that night.
Universities are now required 
to make all their crime statistics 
available to the public. This means 
that prospective students and 
their parents are weighing an 
additional factor in choosing 
among colleges and its an impor
tant factor. Students are fre
quently victims of theft, burglary 
and various violent crimes much 
of which can be attributed to the 
city in which we have chosen to 
attend school. Although we, as 
students, have a responsibility to 
use common sense and take care 
of ourselves, the city is also re
sponsible for keeping us safe.
Now I hate to sound like Im 
selling Dan Cohen as District 
Eight City Council candidate, but 
he is truly concerned about issues 
of safety and security in Pitts
burgh. District 8 encompasses 
Shadyside, Oakland, Bloomfield 
and part of Squirrel Hill, which 
makes it home to CMU students 
on and off campus. Cohen points 
out that burglary alone has in
creased 27% in our district and 
that we do have a significant crime 
problem.
Crime is a major issue facing 
Pittsburgh and CMU so we have 
to be smart and be safe. Take

Editor:
I would like to make a simple 
suggestion to the editor of the 
Forum pages of The Tartan. Next 
time, dont bother to print it. I 
already have enough birdcagelining material after this weeks 
section and do not see the need to 
waste valuable forest products for 
this purpose any more.
Was there even one column with 
any substance whatsoever in 
these pages? For the second (or is 
it third?) week Sue Abrams hear
ing problem was recapitulated 
(although we were thankfully 
spared further whining about her 
oppressive mother). Perhaps Miss 
Abrams should go to columnist 
Don Pickett with her problems 
before she explodes into a long,
arching bright streak across the 
sky.
Picketts last column [Some
times one has to take the express 
elevator to hell 10/17] is perhaps 
the single worst piece of writing I 
have ever forced myself to choke 
down and exemplifies the guano 
filling these pages. Loaded with 
platitudinous bilge, the column 
manages to stuff every major style 
and content error possible in one 
short (but not short enough) piece. 
The Tartan must be short of 
material to print this column 
anywhere.
While indeed the stuff that fishwrapping is made of, the column 
accomplishes nothing. What is Mr. 
Picketts point? nd why the 
gratuitous use of profanity? He
incorrectly uses the metaphor of 
the albatross (I suggest he re
read his Coleridge), hiswild 
theme has absolutely nothing to 
do with his pain theme which is 
weakly connected to his dump
ing on theme. Out of what pit of 
literary feculence did he dredge 
up his ridiculous description of a 
person exploding and arching 
across the sky? Has he ever seen 
this happen? These gross deformi
ties of style might be excused if 
there was any content to the col
umn, but there is not. He merely 
spews hackneyedd observations 
and overused platitudes in a di
arrheal mass.
Why subject us to this dross? 
Perhaps Mr. Pickett should con
sider a career writing advice col
umns for Seventeen? In any case 
this literary flatulence has now 
enabled his column to dethrone 
Josh Rubens Sportspeak as the 
worst writing in The Tartan.
May I suggest to the editors 
that you leave the Forum pages 
out of the next few issues and use 
the funds thus saved to enroll 
your columnists in a beginning 
writing course. There are several 
local literacy projects you could 
contact for more information.

Item: Time magazines lead this 
week: Is Government Dead? As 
government is entirely depend
ent upon the quality of leader

ernment, the question should be 
Are People Dead? Can this coun
try produce people that are fit to 
lead; produce those that possess 
the right gifts, the right attitude, 
the means to govern effectively? 
It seems to be a simple enough 
question  can we take care of 
ourselves? It is a question that 
leads into a nightmare of ideo
logical bungling, incompetence, 
and fear.
The Reagan Revolution, as sick 
and twisted a version of the 
American Dream as ever 
dreamed, started long before 
Ronnie ever stumbled on the po
litical scene. It began with the 
Sixties, when conservatives, both 
those growing up and those in 
power, were faced with the ex
cesses, the radicalism, the mas
sive waste of potential that ended 
the decade.
Don Pickett
Conservatives looked right past 
the positive achievments of the 
Sixties  the idea of people mak
ing sure that government was 
responsive to their needs, the idea 
that activism by individuals could 
change the course of a nation, the 
strange ideas of racial harmony, 
of a society geared towards peace.
The future Reaganites looked 
and saw a horrible splintering of 
the proper America, i.e., the the 
comfortable sense of superiority 
they felt from the Eisenhower 
years, when America ruled by 
force, when all was black and 
white, decisions were easy, and 
gray areas could be ignored. The 
dawning of a new era in geopoli
tics caught the vanguards of con
servatives unawares. Their reac
tion, the beginning of the Reagan 
Revolution, was to set their sights 
on the circles of power, on making 
America great again; on making
it one big white Disneyland.
And so it turned out not a revo
lution, but a counter-revolution, 
an inquisition. A blind, instinc
tive reaction to massive, radical 
change  restore America to 
when she was great, to when 
everything was alright because 
the government said so.
Thus began a single-minded ig
norance of all the problems facing 
us , a frightened, screaming re
treat into the past, hoping to drag 
the country into an age when all 
questions were reduced to Us vs. 
Them. Reagan, wanted the old 
America back so much you could 
almost feel it. Look at him on the 
TV and see the gears churning, 
feel the tears as he saw a world 
that he couldnt comprehend, a 
world in which there were prob
lems that couldnt be solved by 
throwing money or soldiers at it.
If this was an isolated mindset, 
it wouldnt be a problem. In any 
society, at any time, there are 
always those who prefer running 
back to the old than figuring out

Imagine how bad things would 
be if an earthquake had hit Car
negie Mellon. Chatham and CMU 
could all of a sudden be neighbors 
and Andrew would finally crash 
for an explainable reason.
Of course, the chance of an 
earthquake hitting our campus is 
rather small, but CMU is woe
fully unprepared to deal with any 
Sort of disaster, as evidenced by 
the trouble the University has 
had in raising money for the 
University Center.
CMU needs to start its own
readiness program. What if the 
Original Hot Dog Shop blew up 
and littered the campus with 
french fries? By the time we could 
react, the grass would be dead. If 
the football team was practicing 
on the Cut, half of the running 
backs would break their legs and 
ankles as they slip on thirty thou
sand pounds of greasy potatoes.
An even worse scenario would 
be if the campus ran out of Coke 
and Diet Coke. Thousands of allnighters would be in jeopardy as 
architects, programmers, and 
writers all would start to nod off, 
with notliing left to keep them up 
but cigarettes and stale coffee.
However, the ultimate disaster 
would be if bunches of anti-SEI, 
pro-Lyndon LaRouche, and city 
council campaigners were to choke 
the Cut. Students would be un
able to get to classes on time, 7:30 
exams would be delayed, unbeara
bly long Technology & People 
lectures would run even longer, 
and the football team would be 
deprived of another practice field.
Clearly, CMU needs some sort 
of emergency action plan. Disas
ters, like Diskette Day, are wait
ing to happen today.

ation takes a gut courage that a 
lot of people dont have. When it 
isnt there, retreat is an instinct.
But these people, with their 
ideas, have been leading the po
litical strategy for the past fifteen 
years, and will continue into the 
immediate future. How success
ful they are will be a measure of 
how much we have regressed, of 
how much the government has 
been able to erase the advances 
of the past 25 years, of how calci
fied the country has become. The 
America of the fifties is a Reaganite wet dream  best to start 
dusting off the poodle skirts....
Ironic, the final measure of 
progress will be how much can be 
erased, forgotten, changed. But it 
fits. After years of policies de
signed to take us back, the ulti
mate success will be to forget the 
past 25 years, to sink into happy, 
ignorant mediocrity forever.

quences. When her brightness 
finally ignites with the most prac
tical and beneficial plan, all had 
better stand clear. This tiny stick 
of dynamite explodes with a very 
directed force.
Mary Caroline stresses commit
ment and investment. People 
ar e her number one reason to run 
for City Council. She believes that 
in order for problems to be solved, 
people must communicate 
amongst themselves and to their 
elected officials.
Many times, problems are 
pushed aside due to an officials 
lack of commitment to his/her 
office and constituency. Mary 
Caroline knows that once a com
mitment is made, time and care 
must be invested. Holding any 
position of leadership is a tre
mendous investment. Shes tired 
of an apathetic attitude and 
thinks its about time that some
one fight to accomplish what the 
citys pushed aside and unfinished 
projects. She is a compassionate 
and concerned member of this 
community and does not want 
this office for self-serving pur
poses. Shes not some big hunk of 
imported cheese. She wont be 
running off to D.C. in a few years. 
Mary Caroline Hunt wants to 
invest in this position in order to 
represent a people which she is 
deeply rooted to and has been 
deeply committed to by means of 
heritage, family and friends.
Pittsburgh was once tagged the 
most livable city. Sadly, the 
most livable has been replaced 
by most leavable. Statistics 
show that the citys population 
has dramatically dropped. Why? 
Is it frightening crime and drug 
use? Is it obnoxious and frustrat
ing parking problems? Is it di
lapidated conditions of our streets 
and other public facilities? Is it 
unfair high city taxes? Is it the 
lack of jobs? YES! However, it is 
important to keep in mind that 
this strata of problems is stan
dard for practically every city. 
How these problems are rectified 
is what makes the difference 
between a most livable and 
most leavable city.
I believe that Hunt and Cohen 
would like to see Pittsburgh in 
better condition. However, I 
strongly feel that the intentions 
of both candidates are different.
If he should happen to win this 
election, hell prove hes capable 
of raising money  for his party. 
As well, hes liable to polish up
just enough dull spots tq. be 
branded Mr. Clean! Democratic 
ties around the country will 3<Jore 
him.
Yet, what happens wheiTMr. 
Cohens term is through?'His 
plans sounded very general, 
however those goals that conveyed 
any substance had only tones of 
big business and money, money, 
money. There was no small scale 
focus on improving the quality of 
the neighborhood. His plans ap
peared to jump from A to' Z. I 
didnt get a feeling that conse
quences were scrutinized. Big city 
plans were glorified. Remember 
the expression; take the money 
and run... I fear that by the time 
Mr. Cohen reaches Senate, the 
glossy finish from his polishing 
act will turn dull again.
In contrast, behind Mary Caro
line Hunts voice stands firmness 
and continual dedication to the 
city of Pittsburgh. Slow speech 
conveyed clarity and very precise 
plans of action. What can be done 
about crime and safety in the'com
munity? What can be done about 
parking problems? What can be 
done about potholes and broken 
street lights? What can be done 
about drugs in the neighborhood? 
What can be done about high city 
taxes? What can be done about 
bringingjobsto Pittsburgh? What 
can be done about the circus at 
City Council?
Most of Mary Carolines fund
ing has been raised within the 
city from organizations that shes 
been active with or who know her 
quiet but directed capabilities. 
These are experienced and knowl
edgeable people who know what 
should and can feasibly be accom
plished. Her style is not to pull 
out all the stops nor to plunge into 
a seemingly grand plan of action. 
She has immense common sense 
and shed rather take the time to 
do things right. Mary Caroline 
Hunt feels that enough time has 
been taken with glossed over and 
avoided issues.
Its time to halt the City Coun
cil circus act and eliminate all the 
clowns. We dont need any more. 
She may be quiet and small, but 
she stands proud and tall amongst 
a city that believes in what shes 
about. As she can, you can help 
restore responsive, effective and 
caring leadership to Pittsburgh 
City Council if you cast your vote 
for Mary Caroline Hunt. She will 
run an administration according 
to the voices of this city; her com
munity, her family and her 
friends.  You!

Cross-country defends PAC title in shut-out victory
Baseball is a 
great healer
The earthquake may have 
killed hundreds and shattered 
property, but things could have 
ifen worse. Thank the World 
Series for that.
Like many people, I heard the 
first mention of the quake 
during the pre-game show for 
(rime 3 of the World Series. The 
?adio show, like the television 
broadcast, was garbled for a 
mpment, then went silent when 
the station lost power. After 
flipping the dials, I finally 
nifcked up a very fuzzy network 
transmission out of New York 
where the announcer explained 
thjat an earthquake had hit the 
Biy area. Details were sketchy 
and, in New York, they had no 
way of knowing exactly what 
happened.
t flipped back to the station 
broadcasting the game. The 
signal had been restored and 
the announcers were now 
describing the details of the 
Wake. There was no panic.
Tliere was no chaos. People just 
started to filter down on to the 
field and away from the steel 
arid concrete supports of the 
ballpark.
j fis the evening went on, we all 
began to learn more and more 
afy'out what was happening. The 
firjes, the fallen buildings, and 
thfe ultimate tragedy, the 
collapse of highway 880 in 
-Oakland.
For the rest of the week, 
experts kept on predicting that 
the death toll on the bridge 
would be high since the quake 
hit at the height of the rush 
hojur. Then, over the weekend,

Dave Supp leads the pack as the mens cross-country team executed 
a shut-out at the PAC championships Saturday to defend its title.
By ROBIN HENSINGER
Tartan Senior Staffwriter
Carnegie Mellons mens cross
country team crushed their com
petitors at the Presidents Ath
letic Conference with a shut-out 
that had never before been done 
at a PAC championship. This year 
the race was held at Bethany 
College in West Virginia. Coach 
Gary Meckley stated that the 
Tartans created a record that 
cant possibly be broken.
For the entire race the Tartans 
ran as a team, coaching each other 
through the difficult sections. 
They brought in six runners be
fore runners from any other 
schools were near the finish line. 
With only a half-mile to go in the 
race, Meckley pointed out that 
the runner from Grove City is 
almost 100 yards behind our sixth 
man. Sophomore Mike Damon 
commented, we had the longest 
lead Ive ever seen. At the end of 
the race, senior Dave Supp, sen
ior Len ONeal, and sophomore 
Jon Frieder surged to a spectacu
lar finish as they sprinted the last 
fifty yards of the race.
Supp was the first runner to 
cross the line in 28:05, entitling 
him to his third PAC champion 
and MVP title. Supp also received 
these titles in 1986 and 1988. 
ONeal followed only two seconds 
later, and Frieder was just be
hind him in 28:09. Teammates 
Damon, junior Gary Harrison,
"/ was very disappointed that what I 
will remember of my last PAC will be 
the dangerous course, not the cere
mony.
 Co-captain Dave Supp
and senior Gary Meeker were only 
steps behind the leaders as they 
came in 28:18, 22:00, and 23:00 
respectively.
As soon as the gun went off, it 
began to rain, adding yet another 
obstacle to what was already a 
dangerous course. Until minutes 
before the race, the coaches de
bated whether or not to have the 
men run despite several viola
tions to the NCAA regulations. 
The runners decided that they 
needed a race to prepare for up
coming events so they ran the 
race with caution. Meckley, who 
was obviously pleased with their 
performance, said, they ran a 
first-rate race and they ran it 
carefully and intelligently.
Some of the problems with the 
course included poor markers, 
steep hills, narrow passages 
through which only one person 
could pass at a time, and open 
man-hole covers.
The winner of the meet, co
captain Supp said, Usually I set 
a personal goal, for a specific time
or place to finish in, but my only 
goal at the PACs was for everyone 
to finish the race without getting 
hurt.
The times were minutes slower 
than usual, which can probably 
be contributed to the fact that the 
men had to walk or step through 
the dangerous sections of the 
course, stated Supp.
Although the Tartans ran an 
exceptional race, they were not 
awarded with any ceremony, tro
phies, or MVP awards as are tra
dition for the PAC championships, 
due to the absence of the actual 
trophies. Supp commented that, 
I was very disappointed that 
what I will remember of my last 
PAC will be the dangerous course, 
not the ceremony.
The Tartans will fly to New 
York City this weekend for the 
University Athletic Association 
championships in which they 
cannot expect a shut-out victory. 
They will be competing against 
teams that want it as bad as we 
do, said Supp.

upper portion of the bridge off of 
th i lower portion, they 
dii covered that there were not 
as many cars on the bridge as 
'lier suspected. The reason: 
iple had left work early to 
ch Game 3 of the Series so, 
the time the quake hit, most 
he normal rush hour traffic 
 s already across the bridge. 
Kind of strange, huh? The 
(entire country feels for the Bay 
area citizens but there is a bit of 
sofrow on the part of those 
sports fans who looked forward 
tojthe Series. People are upset 
that the Series is taking place 
inja dangerous area. However, 
if the Series were not taking 
place in the Bay area, hundreds 
more may have been killed. In a 
wiy, the World Series has the 
dubious honor of being a 
lifesaver to the people in San 
Francisco and Oakland.
With one exception, every 
player on both teams was more 
than happy to delay the Series 
o4 that the area could focus its 
attention on the more important 
task of recovering from the 
quake. That one exception 
thought the entire Series should 
be, scrubbed.
But once most of the cleanup 
ai^d rescue work is finished, the 
Series will continue. The people 
if the area need something, 
anything, to get their minds off 
rf .their troubles for a while. So 
his 89 Series will prove not 
>n|y to be a rescuer but also a 
Rjiler.

The 1989 Presidents Athletic Conference cham
pionship was up for grabs as the Tartan, soccer 
team faced the Bethany Bisons:
Both teams held a 20 record in PAC games, but 
history was on Bethanys side. The last time Be
thany lost against a PAC team was in 1984, and 
the team had won 17 of the last 19 PAC titles, 
including the last 10 in a row. CMU was unable to 
break the Bisons streak as the Tartans lost, 21.
The first half saw little offense from either team, 
due as much to the field conditions as to good 
defense. The muddy field and light rainfall made 
quick movement a difficult task, causing offensive 
drives to stall. In addition, CMU had to play into 
a bad wind that turned any high kick into an 
adventure. Good defense and good goaltending 
took care of any remaining opportunities as the 
first half ended in a scoreless tie.
The second half began on an encouraging note as 
the rain and wind let up, and about ten minutes in, 
the Tartans got on the board. Tartan forward 
Steve Gardner collided with Bethany goalkeeper 
Omar Jobe, clearing the way for teammate Rob 
Schaefer to knock the loose ball into the net.
About ten minutes later, the Bisons evened the 
score with a touch of controversy. As Bethany 
prepared for a goal kick, coach Nick Gaudioso 
attempted to make a substitution, but was unable
to get the attention of the official to stop action. 
Instead of getting a .quick pause to regroup, the 
Tartans got burned on a goal by Bison forward 
Ebou Conateh, and it was a brand new game, 11.
The teams battled back and forth for the next 
twenty minutes, and it looked as if the game was 
destined for overtime when disaster struck. With 
under two minutes left, defender John Stivoric 
was called for a hand ball in front of the net which 
resulted in aBethany penalty kick. Conateh scored 
his second goal of the game on the kick, and 
Bethany ran out the clock to come away with the 
2-1 win.
In other action this week, the Tartans dosed out 
their road season on a positive note with a 31 win 
against Geneva College. Gardner scored a pair of 
goals, and Eddie Park, the Tartansleading scorer, 
added a goal for good measure. The lone Geneva 
goal came with about ten minutes left, when the 
game was all but over.
The last two games of the season will be played 
this week, as the 6-7-1 Tartans attempt to sal
vage a .500 season. Carnegie Mellon plays Point 
Park College at Shadyside Academy today before 
heading back to Sewickley Academy for Saturdays 
season finale.

Greenville, PA  Carnegie 
Melloh had not lost a football game 
to Thiel College since 1975. Not 
until the Tartans were ambushed 
by the Tomcats, 19-14.
Thiels Jeff Sorenson threw a 
four-yard touchdown pass to 
William ^B arber with four seconds 
remaining to win the game, but 
the Tartans had lost the game 
much earlier.
We played a half a game, said 
Tartan Head Coach Rich Lackner.
The Tartans (4-3,2-1 PAC) did 
play the first half, taking a 14-0 
lead, but didnt seem to be play

54 second-half yards and no 
points.
The game was played under less 
than ideal conditions. Rain had

cold air made the ball heavier.

on solid footing and a dry football. 
Carnegie Mellon fumbled the ball 
five times.
However, halfback Dean 
Garofola had a different 
explanation for the Tartans 
problems. It wasnt caused by 
the weather, he said. We gave 
[the game] to them.
Carnegie Mellon seemed to have 
the game well in hand in the first 
half. After a scoreless first 
quarter, the team drove downfield 
in a fifteen play touchdown drive. 
The drive was capped by an
11yard pass from quarterback 
Billy Snyder to Garofola for a 6-0 
lead.
The Tartans added a second 
touchdown on their next drive. 
Snyder hooked with his halfbacks, 
Drew Pizzurro and Scott Barnyak 
for passes of 14,18, and 18 yards 
to quickly move the ball. Snyder 
then hit tight-end Marty Stovar 
for the seniors second touchdown 
of the season.
However after that score, the 
Tartans could.not move the ball. 
Both third quarter Carnegie 
Mellon drives ended in punts.

The CMU hockey club split two 
games this weekend, defeating 
New York University Saturday, 
but losing to John Carroll Uni
versity Sunday.
The 54 win over NYU came by 
virtue of goals scored by Jan-Marc 
Featherston, Dave Collins, Paul 
Martinchich and Ed Kilduff, who 
had two goals.
The game was pretty good, 
said Collins, one of the captains of 
the team. It was pretty tight into 
the third period. The game was 
tied up that point at 2-2, until
CMU exploded and scored three 
goals, said Collins.
Sunday, Carnegie Mellon did 
not have such terrific luck against 
John Carroll, losing 3-0. The 
offense didnt go at all, said 
Collins. Things werentclicking.
But, according to Collins, CMU 
was spared a worse shut out 
thanks to the goalie work of John 
Kerber, who kept the score down. 
He had a great game, said 
Collins.
Franklin and Marshall is next 
on Carnegie Mellons agenda, as 
it heads to Lancaster, PA for Fri

composure to win the next four 
points, bringing the score to 4-3. 
Brehend called a time out at 8-7 
to break the CMU momentum. 
Then Brehend drove back to a 
13-9 lead and looked as if it was 
going to hand the Tartans its 
second sweep of the day. Carne
gie Mellon called time out at 13-9 
and won two straight points 
(1113). The serve was exchanged 
many times until the Tartans 
clawed their way to a 15-13 vic
tory.
In the deciding game against 
Brehend, the Tartans started with 
a 5-0 lead. Brehend responded 
with a few points of its own and 
took a 9-<5 lead over the Tartans. 
The contest was extremely close, 
up to 1211 in favor of Carnegie 
Mellon. Unfortunately, the Tar
tans could not close out the game 
and lost 1215. The Tartans had 
a struggle with Thiel College 
Thursday night, but proved victo
rious. Thiel had the Tartans down 
two games to one in the best of 
five contest, but the Tartans held 
on to win 153, 415, 815, 5-6, 
15-10.
In the match against St. John 
Fisher College, Carnegie Mellon 
found itself in a 2-9 deficit dur
ing the first game. The Tartans 
then began a furious charge to 
even the score at 10-10. St. John 
won the serve back and ended the 
game with a 1511 win.
The Tartans did not fare as well 
in the second game with St. John. 
After a 4-^4 score in the begin

The IM football season came to 
a close with three championship 
games in one day. Two upsets and 
a third won by the favorite in the 
final seconds added up to a great 
day in football.
The first upset of the day was 
the majors championship game. 
ATO and Beta squared off in a 
mud covered field to find out which 
fraternity played better football. 
Earlier in the season, Beta and 
ATO met in a contest that ended 
up in being cancelled due to in
clement weather.
ATO started the game with a 
three-play drive that was inter
cepted by Betas Dan Crimmins. 
Beta had the ball for one play 
before the second turnover of the 
game occurred. Steve Calfo of ATO 
intercepted a J.D. Heskamp pass, 
and started its drive down the 
field again. Six plays later, ATO 
quarterback Gary Breauninger 
connected with Scott Baciak for 
the first score of the game. The 
extra point attempt was good as 
Frank Randall caught another
Breauninger pass.
Betas next drive was shut down 
quickly and ATO once again took 
control of the game. The drive 
lasted for a while, but ended as 
Jeff Caringola, the most valuable 
player of the game, intercepted a 
Breauninger pass. The half ended 
after Beta failed to complete two 
Hail Marys.
The second half started with a 
few more turnovers on each side. 
For Betas second drive of the 
third quarter, Heskamp, the 
quarterback, swapped positions 
with Caringola, the receiver. 
Three plays later, Caringola con
nected with Heskamp for the first 
Beta touchdown. On the extra 
point attempt, Heskamp threw a 
pass to Caringola to tie the game 
at seven.
ATO then began what would 
turn out to be the longest drive of 
the game. Unfortunately, after
11 plays, all ATO got out of the 
drive was a good defensive posi
tion. Dan Crimmins intercepted 
a pass to give control back to Beta.
With Caringola still playing 
quarterback, Beta quickly covered 
the length of the field and scored

majors championship game. ATO 
and Beta squared off in a mud cov
ered field to find out which fraternity 
played better football.
its second touchdown on a Carin
gola run; Crimmins caught the 
pass for the extra point. ATO had 
another drive to tie the game, but 
failed to convert on the fourth 
down and Beta ran off with the 
upset and the victory.
In the intermediate champion
ship game, SAE, last years cham
pions, met Spirit A, last years 
revamped majors champions.
Alan Lee of SAE received the 
ball on the opening kickoff and 
proceeded to return it for a touch
down. The extra point attempt 
failed, but SAE didnt seem to 
mind; the team was ahead by six, 
and less than twenty seconds of 
play time was lost. Spirits first 
drive was cut short by some in
credible defensive playing and 
was forced to punt the ball away.
SAEs first drive culminated 
in its second touchdown of the 
game. John Hoehl, the SAE 
quarterback, hit Warren Flax 
in the endzone. This time, SAE 
converted the extra point on a 
Hoehl run.
Spirit finally scored on its 
next drive as quarterback 
Barry Franklin hit Bill Jones. 
Franklin ran in the good extra 
point. The last drive of the fiit 
half gave SAE one last change 
to score, but hopes were dashed 
as Franklin intercepted one !of 
its passes.
The second half started wilh 
a Spirit drive that terminated 
with a game-tying touchdown. 
The game continued with both 
teams increasing their defenVolumle84 ol ,Is8 OIM Standings

the game, SAE scored as Hoehl 
connected with John DAmico for 
another touchdown.
Franklin connected with his 
center, Dave Crazy Legs Sow
ers, 37 seconds later to tie the 
game at 19.
For the extra point, Franklin
hit Mike Ramseur to put Spirit up 
by one. Another,62 seconds elasped before SAE retook the lead.
Hoehl ran in for the touchdown, 
but failed to convert on the extra 
point.
Spirit tried one last deperate 
drive to regain the lead. With four 
seconds left on the clock, Fran
klin hiked the ball from a shotgun
formation. The four seconds elasped as he looked for an open re
ceiver. Jones caught the ball and 
fell on the far right side of the 
endzone. Spirit won the game by 
a point.
The MVPs of the intermediate 
league championships were Bill 
Jones and Barry Franklin, both 
from Spirit.
Carnegie Mellons womens 
cross-country team decided not to 
compete at the Presidents 
Atheltic Conference due to un
safe course conditions at Bethany 
College. There were open man
hole covers on a down-hill of the 
course and created the chance for 
possible injury to the runners.
Womens coach Dario Donatelli 
stated, We felt the course was 
not suitable and it was not worth 
running on the course when we 
have other more important meets 
coming up. They left Bethany 
and came back to Carnegie Mel
lon for time trials to decide who 
would be accompanying the team 
to New York City this weekend 
for the University Athletic Asso
ciation (UAA) championship.
Dana Butts, a runner from 
Thiel, came in first at the PACs. 
However, Grove City, the only 
team with sufficient runners, won 
the meet.

Vitamins are more effective than No-Doz in pulling stressful
By-SHEELA SKAFF
Tartan Staffwriter
its 2:30 on a Tuesday morning 
and youre just finishing that last 
assignment when you realize that 
you havent even begun your
physics homework.
All your body wants to do is roll 
into bed and fall asleep  you 
have a cold, that migraine is both
ering you again, your girlfriend 
has told you to get lost, andthinking about physics is only making 
you feel worse.
At this point, theres only one 
thing left to do. Pop a No-Doz and 
suck down a fourth cup of coffee.
This scenario may be a little 
extreme, but the kind of stress 
that it represents is all too com
mon for students.
We all know the tension that 
comes when we are faced with a 
task we dont want to handle, the 
depression that easily can become 
a part of our everyday lives, and
the anxiety when it seems that 
the problems just wont go away. 
It makes us want to tear our hair 
out and scream.
Psychological stress is only one 
of three kinds of stress we are 
faced with. Less obvious, but 
equally important, are physiologi
cal and environmental stress. 
Physiological stress is caused by 
illness, infection, injury, burns, 
or other physical ailments. Envi
ronmental stress is caused when 
your body has to deal with celltoxic substances like air, food, 
water pollutants, and radiation.
Extremes of temperature, like 
those that have been occuring here 
in Pittsburgh, are also stressful. 
Temperature fluctuations force
our bodies thermal-conservation 
systems to work harder in order 
to maintain a temperature of 98.6 
degrees farenheit.
Both physiological and environ
mental stress can damage cells, 
increasing the bodys workload 
as the body tries to repair the 
damaged cells, and in the process 
depletes vital nutrients.
It is very easy to find yourself 
suffering from all three kind of 
stress at once. Amazingly, by 
raising the intake of certain es
sential vitamins and minerals 
while under stress, you can even 
throw away the No-Doz.
Vitamins and minerals will help 
your body and mind compensate 
for the lack of sleep and the pol
luted air.
By increasing the amount of a 
few micronutrients which are 
already present in your normal 
diet, psychological stress can be 
greatly reduced.
When under emotional stress, 
these nutrients are important to 
take: vitamin B complex, one 
capsule daily; pantothenic acid, 
500 mg three times daily; biotin, 
lOOmg; inositol, 300 mg; vitamin 
C, 3 grams; vitamin E, 600 I.U.; 
calcium, 1200 mg; magnesium, 
800mg; zinc, 100 mg.
Living in Pittsburgh, we are 
subjected to many pollutants that 
are not found in more rural areas. 
Certain micronutrients can help 
to reduce the effects caused by
all-nighters
these pollutants: beta caroteiL. 
vitamin C, vitamin E, zinc, vitg 
min K, calcium, and magnesiuir,
Because of the extreme flucua 
tions of heat and cold we havi 
been experiencing, vitamin C ii 
important to reduce perspiratio.t 
improve skin circulation, and con. 
trol body temperature.
Of course, none of this wil] 
overpower a good diet and exer
cise program. But, combined with 
other health habits, supplement 
ing your diet with vitamins and 
nutrients can reduce stress and 
make a difference in feeling your 
best.
Sheila Skaff is an undecided 
H&SS freshman who doesnt 
thrive on stress.

Carnegie Mellon Universitys 
Drama Department celebrates
5, seventy-five years of excellence 
this fall. As one of the nations top 
drama schools, Carnegie Mellon 
; boasts a plethora of distinguished 
alumni in theater, television, and 
movies. These alumni are enter
tainers who vary in age as well as 
profession; they span from the 
; class of 1914 to the class of 1989,
I and range from stage actors to 
; movie producers. This year the 
Drama Department can reflect 
on just a few its successful gradu
ates and be extremely proud its 
achievements.
Troy Curvey, Jr., who gradu
ated in 1979, makes his home in 
Los Angeles and is engaged in a 
busy television career. Curvey has 
1 appeared in popular shows such 
as Hill Street Blues, in the recur
ring role of a gangleader, and the 
murder mystery show Mike Ham
mer. He has also performed in 
the hit musical West Side Story.
? Currently, he can be seen on CBS 
prime time in the new series 
Snoops. Curvey says his most 
notable role is in the film Colors 
with Sean Penn, simply because 
everyone saw it... everytime I go 
places, [people] say Youre the 
preacher! 
Curvey recalls his most embar
rassing incident at CMU as the 
time when he was forced to walk 
around the campus in a toga in 
r order to practice for his next part; 
a raunchy character in a drama 
production. He believes that Car
negie Mellon has done a great
deal for him and has kept in touch 
with the Drama Department by 
returning in spring 1988 to work 
on a project with drama students.
Another 1979 graduate is pro
ducer/writer John Wells. Wells is 
the supervising producer/writer 
of ABCs top-rated drama, China 
Beach, which airs prime time on 
Wednesday nights. Recently, 
China Beach was nominated for 
the Best Drama Series Emmy; 
this is an occurrence for which 
Wells can take much of the credit. 
In addition, Wells has worked on 
hit shows such as Moonlighting 
andNBCs blockbuster, LA. Law.
I came to Carnegie Mellon 
because the guy who ran my high 
school theater department - who 
I was asking about the best thea
ter schools in the country  said 
Well the best is Carnegie Mellon, 
but youd never get in, so I guess 
I came on a dare, Wells says. He 
maintains that his training at 
CMU has been the basis of every
thing hes done so far with his 
career.
One of the stars of the NBC 
drama series LA. Law, Michael 
Tucker, graduated from Carne
gie Mellon in the class of 1966. 
Tucker says he chose to attend 
Carnegie Mellon because when 
he was Applying to drama 
schools, it was the best in the 
country - so when I got in, there
was no question in my mind as to 
where I was going.
About the 75th anniversary of 
the Drama Department, Tucker 
says, Im just glad that the de
partment is still going strong. 
He says the Drama Department 
at CMU has helped him in many 
different ways by giving him his 
first professional training and by 
establishing many contacts with 
people who have been important 
to his career.
Ken Johnson graduated in 1964 
as a directing major from Carne
gie Techs Drama School. Johnson 
maintains a career as a director/ 
writer/producer. He is responsible 
for the creation of many hit series 
during the 1970s such as The 
Six-Million Dollar Man, The Bi
onic Woman, and The Incredible 
Hulk. Currently, Johnson is work
ing as executive producer for the 
Fox networks new series Alien 
Nation.
Johnson says that a Carnegie 
Mellon education has helped him 
tremendously because of its ver
satile and rigorous program. 
When I was at Tech, the Drama 
Department had always been pri
marily a theater school with no 
film and no tele vision, and I think 
theres a lot of good, sound phi
losophy behind that. The theory 
being that if you learn to get a 
performance out of a director on
the board, you can then translate 
it into the other media.
Johnson says he decided to at
tend Carnegie Mellon because a 
high school teacher persuaded 
him to look at the school, and he 
decided he liked it. I loved the 
school. I miss it to this day. I 
learned a tremendous amount 
about my craft and polished my 
art. It was just the right place to 
be for me, and I really feel that 
the school shaped me immensely 
as a creative person. It was a 
constant challenge to all of us to 
excel, and to me ... it was like 
home. My freshman year, I said
Wow! This is the where I really 
belong. My crew still sees me 
walking around in my Carnegie 
Tech sweatshirts.
A 1962 graduate of the Carne
gie Tech Drama School, Ren 
Aubeijonois, starred on TVs top 
rated Benson for six seasons as 
the haughty chief of staff Clay
ton. He received a Tony award for 
his role opposite Katherine Hep
burn in the musical Coco; he has 
also appeared in popular offBroadway shows such as Big 
River. His most recent Broadway 
appearance was withMikhail 
Baryshnikov in Metamorphosis.
Aubeijonois says that his en
rollment at Carnegie Mellon; 
depended largely on the fact that 
at that time, it just had the repu
tation of being the best drama 
school in the country.
Ive been out of school a long 
time, says Auberjonois, and 
there are a lot of people who I 
graduated with who are successiul professional people and do not. 
necessarily list the university they 
went to in their biographies when 
they try out for a part. Rarely do 
people list the university they 
studied at, but I always have beVoluNle84 ol ,Is8 jb

This year, Carnegie Mellons Depart
ment of Drama celebrates its 75th year 
anniversary. When it was started, it was 
the only department in the world that 
offered a degree in drama.
It is nationally renown for its quality 
and intensity. Anne Marie Cummings
 lead actor in this years production of 
As You Like It  said, I think its a very 
intense program. You definitely have to 
love what youre doing  You have to 
have enough confidence to hold your 
ground.
Seventy five years ago  on 
Shakespeares 350th birthday, April 
23rd  the Drama Department put 
on Two Gentlemen of Verona. In the 
past, there was a long standing tra
dition of showing a Shakespearean 
play every year on the evening of his 
birthday which started that night.
Throughout the Drama 
Departments seventy five year his
tory, many graduates have gone on 
to fame and success. Some former 
graduates that have achieved suc
cess in their fields are Robert Foxworth, Shari Belafonte Harper, Ted 
Danson, Barbara Feldon, Frank Gorshin, Mariette Hartley, Elizabeth Hart
man, Holly Hunter, Ken Johnson, Jack 
Klugman, Judith Light, Michael 
McKean, George Peppard, George Rom
ero, Richard Sanders, Blair Underwood; 
Ren Aubeijonois and Albert Brooks.
This year, the Drama Department 
celebrates by reproducing the Shake
spearean play As You Like It. Last Sat
urday, two bus loads of alumni from New 
York came to see the play and a recep
tion was held afterwords. The Carnegie 
Mellon Department of Drama continues 
to be strong and the seventy five years 
have only brought on improvement and 
growth.

Ellen Travolta, a 1959 gradu
ate of the Carnegie Tech Drama 
School, plays Scott Baios mother 
on the situation comedy Charles 
in Charge. She appeared in popu
lar shows of the 1970s such as 
Happy Days, Welcome Back Kot
ter, and All in the Family. How
ever, she says that her family has 
always been more important to 
her than her career. Travolta, the 
older sister of John Travolta, 
says she was interested in stage 
and [CMU] was the finest theater 
school in the country and had by 
far the best reputation.
Sada Thompson, one of the most 
succesful graduates of the class of 
1949, won an Emmy for Best
Actress for her role in Family. 
She has also appeared in thirteen 
off-Broadway shows and received 
Obie Awards for her performances 
in several productions. Thompson 
says, I came to Carnegie Tech 
because... a friend of mine... who 
was a year ahead of me in school 
went to Carnegie Tech and came 
home with such glowing reports. 
I said thats where Id like to try. 
I think [my training at Carnegie 
Tech] helped me a lot, she says.
Producer, director, and writer 
Bob Finkel graduated from Car
negie Techs Drama School in 
1940. Finkel heads his own pro
duction company in Los Angeles 
and produces a variety of televi
sion shows, including The Miss 
Universe Pageant, The Academy 
Awards Show, and Barney Miller.
Finkel has accumulated ten 
Emmy nominations and has re. 
ceived three Emmys for his work 
on The Andy Williams Show.
Finkel says, There were a 
number of things that happened 
in my life that made me choose 
the Drama Department. I had a 
lot of family that went to Carne
gie... so Carnegie was a part of my 
life. I had some friends who were 
at the school, at the drama de
partment at that time. I watched 
them, and I finally decided that 
that was the place I wanted to be, 
And if I wanted to be in the thea-i

By DEXTER T. KOBAYASHI
Tartan Staffwriter
TheABCsofeatingdisorders; 
anorexia, bulimia, and compul
sive overeating  are more com
mon and dangerous than most 
people think.
When people hear the term 
eatingdisorder, they often think 
of the shy, gaunt, and pale girl 
who is always complaining about 
how fat she is. What most people 
dont realize is that eating disor
ders arent always that apparent 
and that they are far more com
mon than they think.
According to a national survey, 
approximately 35% of college-age 
students are suffering from some 
type of eating disorder. This is not
just something that attacks fe
males, either. The national figure 
for men with eating disorders has 
increased from 1% to 10% in re
cent years. Eating Disorder 
Awareness Week, October 23 - 
29, was created to make people 
more aware of the dangers of this 
disease.
The first step in making people 
more aware of eating disorders is 
to explain the term eating disor
der. An eating disorder is a disorderthat causes someone to dras
tically change their natural eat
ing habits.
It is more of a psychological 
disease than a niere physical one. 
The disease is caused by anxiety 
or stress. In this way, anorexia 
and compulsive overeating are
very similar. The compulsive 
eaters use eating as a tool to re
lieve their stress while anorexic 
people diet to regain their sense 
of control. In both cases, the body 
suffers and the problems that 
caused the stress and anxiety get 
worse.
Anorexia and bulimia can some
times be very hard to spot. Most 
anorexics and bulimics seem like 
very happy, successful and confi
dent people on the outside. How
ever, here are some warning signs 
given by the Tri-State Eating 
Disorders Center: making excuses 
during lunch period why she/he is 
not eating, dissatisfied with 
weight in spite of excessive weight 
loss, going to restroom a lot, espe
cially after meals, wearing layers
of clothing, always cold, loss of 
scalp hair, red knuckles from 
forced vomiting, sudden and se
vere tooth decay, discussing di
eting, calories, weight, and 
exercise a lot, cutting up food in 
tiny pieces, playing with food, and 
petty stealing of money to buy 
food for binges.
Even after spotting a person 
with an eating disorder, it is diffi
cult to know what to do. Most of
ten, people try constructive criti
cism. Telling an anorexic person, 
You look rather skeletal, maybe 
you should gain some more 
weight, will only cause the per
son to feel that he or she is suc
cessful in attaining the goal of 
becoming skinnier and will en
courage the anorexic to continue.
If you suspect a friend of having 
an eating disorder, The Tri-State 
Disorders Center suggests that 
you tell the person you are con
cerned about her/him. Remem
ber to let her/him know that you 
are scared, that you care, and you 
would like to help. This will put 
them less on the defensive. They 
also say, Do not discuss weight, 
the number of calories being con
sumed or particular eating hab
its. Do not focus on looks or how 
one ought to eat or look. Try to 
discuss other things besides food, 
weight, counting calories and 
exercise. Try to discuss their feel
ings.
Because Carnegie Mellon is 
such a stressful school and be
cause it attracts such high achiev
ing people, students here are very 
susceptible to anything they fee] 
will reduce their stress. When 
making the transition from high 
school to college, from childhood 
to adulthood, it can be very unnerving to have ones foundations 
shaken and sometimes people feel 
like they are losing control. The 
step to college is a big one ant 
eating disorders are an attempi 
to gain control over something 
that is new or unexpected.
Roseanne Hickey of the Coun. 
seling Center said, I think its s 
big problem and Id like people to 
know that they can get help at the 
Counseling Center or we can re
fer them somewhere else. Every, 
thing done here is confidential 
and free.
Man On the Street
The San Francisco Bay area 
was devastated by an earth
quake last Tuesday a little after 
8 pm EST. Tradgedy struck on 
Interstate 880 in Oakland when 
many people were crushed to 
death and over four hundred 
more were injured as the upper 
level came crashing down on 
the lower level and its unsus
pecting motorists.
Power and phone lines were 
knocked down by the quake leav
ing over one million people with
out electricity and phones.
The earthquake which was 
centered about seventy five miles 
south of San Francisco along 
the San Andreas fault reached 
intensities of 6.8 on the Richter 
scale and stands as the second 
deadliest earthquake in the 
nation's history.
Everett Tademy's picture 
was not available.
Mark Chan, Freshman, H&SS
I was in CFA listening to the 
radio when I heard. I called home 
and the lines were down. My mom 
got through to me and said every
thing was fine. No one was hurt 
and there was no structural dam
age.
Thad Druffel, Senior, CIT
I know a lot of buildings are 
kinda old, a lot of structural 
damage. I couldnt get through to 
my sister until the next day. She 
lives in a dorm and shes OK I 
also know a pool that lost 10,000 
pounds. Thats a lot of water.
Kevin Lucas, Grad Student, 
CIT
At first I thought it was tragic; 
a quake in San Francisco. Then I 
found out the epicenter was in my 
hometown [Santa Cruz]. My 
family was fine and I dont know 
anyone who was hurt. Our chim
ney was cracked.
Jay Brockman, Grad Student, 
CIT
I went home and watched the 
news. San Francisco looked like 
Dresden after the war. I thought 
it was gone. I talked to my friends 
in Santa Cruz. There wasnt much 
damage. The news reporting was 
very irresponsible.

My parents had to call me. 
They said everyones OK, but 
they didnt know where my 
father was. He was stuck in 
traffic and had just gotten off 
the Route 880 bridge when the 
quake hit.

"Tartan Staffwriter
' I would be making my own per
sonal offering to the great Shrine 
of Redundancy if I were to say 
that England and the United 
States are very different from one 
another. Indeed, there are great, 
world-renowned differences be
tween thetwo countriesconsti
tutional monarchy against con
stitutional democracy, dollars 
against pounds, Thatcher against 
Bush, driving on the left side of 
the road against driving on the 
right hand side of the road and of 
course, football against ... well, 
i'Tyou know ... football. Needless to 
say, these differences make each 
country unique in its own way,
. .but there are other, farther reach
ing, harder hitting discrepancies
 which have truly impressed upon 
me that I am a stranger in a 
strange land.
One of the most relevant differ
ences I have found is in the nam, ing of candy bars. In England, 
what we know as the Milky Way 
bar is called the Mars bar, and 
Snickers bars are packaged un
der the name of Marathon Bars.
Thankfully, Marathon bars bear 
a legend which states INTER
NATIONALLY MARKETED AS 
SNICKERS. I have heard that 
England will adopt the name 
Snickers as one of the compro
mises of the EEC merger of1992. 
To foul us up a little bit more, the 
English do have a Milky Way bar, 
which is neither aMarsbar,aswe 
know it, nor a Milky Way bar, but 
an autonomous, independent 
confection. In addition, while 
M&Ms are available in the U.K, 
they are second in popularity to 
SMARTIES. SMARTIES, by the 
way, underwent a media blitz a 
short time ago when the blue 
colored smarty was returned to 
the market following a prolonged 
exile during which the blue col
ored smarty was considered harm
ful. Sound familiar?
Food is the most easily discern
ible source of discrepancy between 
the U.S. and the U.K. For ex
ample, here the raisins are lighter 
colored and referred to as sul
tanas; consequently you get to sit 
down to a bowl of Sultana Bran 
in the morning. By appointment 
from the queen, Frosted Flakes 
are known as Frosties, but they 
still figure Tony the Tiger on the 
label. Rice Krispies have fared 
worse, undergoing a name change 
and a costume change for Snap, 
Crackle and Pop (who now looks 
like a cross between Spock and 
Captain Marvel). Grape Nuts 
remain Grape Nuts in England; 
they also remain revolting. In 
order to make your breakfast more 
palatable, milk is delivered daily 
to your doorstep  but should 
you dribble from your glass bottle 
you will have to go far to find a 
napkin. By the way, if you want 
to chill your orange juice, ice is
Food is the most easily discernible source of discrepancy 
between the U.S. and the U.K. For example, here the rai
sins are lighter colored and referred to as sultanas; con
sequently you get to sit down to a bowl of Sultana Bran 
in the morning.
notan option:its just not done. 
And by the way, the tin foil sucks.
One important aspect of food 
preparation is being aware of 
whether your stove is on or not. I 
managed to spend fifteen min
utes waiting for my can of Chunky 
soup to simmer (some things are 
universal after all) until my G.R. 
(R.A.) explained the importance 
of flipping the on-off switch on the 
electrical outlet to the on posi
tion. Speaking of electricity, light 
bulbs do n ot screw in h ere; rather, 
they pop in. I will leave it to the 
Freudians out there to figure out 
the implications of this. I also 
found that, even in England, tin 
foil cannot go in the microwave. I 
would rather not talk about it. 
Another difference in electricity 
is that English electrical appli
ances come with a power cord, but 
not an electrical plug; these have 
to be purchased separately and 
are about the size of a bar of Ivory 
soap (family size). I am not cer
tain as to whether the cord screws 
into the plug or pops into the 
plug: Freud was never my strong 
subject.
Drinking is as popular here as 
anywhere else (NOO-Really?), 
however, the school pub here 
serves beer all day long. Scotland 
Yard doesnt  need I say more?
If beer is not your drink, you can 
expect to get a microscopic glass 
of soda (the cans in pubs hold 
about eight ounces) at macro
scopic prices (about $1 ... by the 
way, if you are a smoker, you can 
expect to shell out 17 cents for a 
book of matches). Shouldyou ven
ture to the comer shop and buy a 
real can of pop, you will find that 
your can will employ the fully re
movable pull tab, which is the 
norm here, as opposed to the half 
inversion push tab used in the 
States. Finally, should you wish 
to gauge how much of the bitter 
you have drunk is going to go to 
your waist, as opposed to, say a 
diet soda (many of which still 
contain saccharine as their only 
sweetener), you will find the calo
ries are quite euphemistically re
ferred to as energy. I gather 
that bitter is much longer on the 
energy than diet soda.
Speaking of pubs, they all close 
at 11. Thanks to this, you can 
employ all of your newfound en
ergy in finding your way home by 
midnight.
Amidst the mobs coming out of 
the pubs at closing time, it is easy 
to tell the Americans apart be
cause most of them wear sneak
ers or tennis shoes, while the 
English are more likely to wear
Trainers (which means that here, 
sneaker tamers are called 
Trainer Tamers) and less likely 
to be wearing them at any given 
time. The Americans are also eas
ily spotted as the ones gaping 
over the pictures of nude women 
on page three of the London Tab
loids.
Speaking of journalism, Im 
writing my column in 81/2 by 11 
1/2 paper with four holes  none 
of which correspond to the three 
holes in my red, white, and blue 
three-ring binder. Normally, I 
would avoid the problem of put
ting 81/2 by 111/2 paper into the 
American envelopes I brought 
from the States by phoning in my 
column. Unfortunately, I have a 
great fear of British Telcom. Not 
only do the public phones look 
like beagle-sized coffins, I am 
convinced that the earpiece is, in 
fact, a medieval torture device. 
Computers, by the way, are no
where near as commonplace as at 
Carnegie Mellon, besides, since 
IBM and Apple run a distant sec
ond to AMSTRAD in the English 
home computer market my disk
ettes would be useless anyway.
Once I am through writing I 
plan on washing up. Easier said 
than done, since water pressure 
is not an idea indigenous to this
area. After spending the lions 
share of the evening trying tci 
rinse, I will have to answer the 
call of nature by indulging in the; 
exercise of repeated and persis
tent flushing. I have already 
added several inches to my biceps 
in this manner, something which 
is followed by the workout oil! 
rapidly switching my hands back 
and forth between the hot anc! 
cold water taps  invariably 
spaced a foot apart  in order to 
save my hands from the scalding 
discharge of the instant heaters 
placed over every faucet.
By bedtime I can close my eyes, 
knowing that like jet lag, culture 
shock is transient. I will get over 
it, probably by the time Im back 
home, where the whole trauma 
will spring again.
I would like to close by saying 
how deeply the news of Graham 
Chapmans death struck me; il 
occurred three days before this 
writing, I would like to print this 
in his memory:

I came to CMU a number of 
years ago. I brought with me a 
problem I had been carrying 
around for quite a while. I had an 
eating disorder. I had been ano
rexic and bulemic for the last three 
years. A number of years earlier, 
in the midst of a stressful period 
in our family life, I had gone on a 
diet. I lost some weight and it felt 
good. It also seemed to please oth.;ers, so I lost some more. Soon I 
J. was spending a large percent
age of my energy thinking about 
planning my diet. My grades did
not falter. As a matter of fact, 
they stabilized at straight As. I 
began feeling secure in my life. I 
had total control.
On weekdays I ate a cup of cot
tage cheese at noon and a salad in 
the evening, nothing else. I lost 
control over the weekends  I 
would consume very large quan
tities of food after everyone had 
gone to sleep or when I could be 
home alone. Eventually, the guilt 
got to me and I began to induce 
vomiting. After a while, the binges 
really took over my life. If I ever 
had trouble with boyfriends, 
family members, or friends, I was 
generally very agreeable, avoid
ing confrontations. Often, such 
events would be followed by a 
binge and purge. I would handle
trouble sleeping or frustration 
with homework in a similar 
manner. My moods swung a lot. I 
was often depressed or anxious, 
but since my method of dealing 
with these negative feelings did 
not go to the heart of the problem, 
my temporary relief was followed 
by more depression and anxiety, 
this continued, I became less and 
less capable of understanding why 
I was having these feelings. I 
became a happy, agreeable, com
petent person on the outside and 
a confused, depressed, anxious 
person on the inside. Eventually, 
the darker side took over the 
lighter side and I began with
drawing. After spending a week 
by myself, binging, purging, sleeping, and falling behind in
schoolwork, I realized I needed 
help if I was ever going to get 
through school.
I went to the Counseling Cen
ter across from the Health Center 
in Morewood Gardens. After an 
initial interview, I began meeting 
weekly with a therapist. I worked 
with the individual therapist for 
a while and then went to Western 
Psychiatric Institute and worked 
with a team of specialists. It took 
a total of two and a half years of 
concentrated effort to actually feel 
completely recovered. At this 
point, I realized that I had accom
plished much more during my stay 
in Pittsburgh than the probable 
completion of a degree. I have 
grown up, learned to love and 
hate, learned to face lifes ups and
downs head on. My relationships 
are fuller, more honest and more 
satisfying.
Many people who develop eat
ing disorders are ambitious, suc
cessful individuals. Self-identifi
cation of the problem is often dif
ficult. Often someone will realize 
he or she has a problem and de
cide to work on it individually 
when it is necessary. After all 
these people are (or, at least, tr 
to act) capable and in control. The 
problem is complicated. It takes 
time to understand and practice s 
new behavior. It requires a lot of 
courage and it is necessary to

EHmumls up8 tuoHx on i8Y UoHM Smux
By JASON LEE SMITH
Tartan Staffwriter
Before I began my illustrious 
career as a Tartan staffwriter, I 
aspired to be the writer of hardboiled detective stories. It is with a 
certain amount of nostalgia that I 
present one of my first efforts in 
that field, a work entitled, City of 
a Million Stories.
New York City.
My city.
Throughout the city run streets: 
good, American streets. Streets 
laid down by good strong Ameri
can streetlayers, and driven upon 
by sturdy American automobiles. 
Each of these automobiles driven 
to and from work in New York 
City.
My city.
Next door to these streets are 
buildings, and in these build
ings are people: good, pure, 
American people. American 
people whose pioneering spirit 
made it possible to build these 
clean streets next door to the 
good, strong, American build
ings. It's Americans like these 
who would want to live in New 
York City.
My city.
One thing that these good 
American people have more 
than anything else are stories. 
On any given day you can find 
more than a million of them 
These stories show the good, 
strong, pure, American pioneer
ing spirit. They show the pio
neering spirit of good, proud 
Americans like you or me, people 
with stories. People who live in 
New York City.
My city.
Thats where I come in. Im a 
good, strong, proud, pure, 
American pioneer, and I know 
all the stories. Sometimes I only 
know one chapter, sometimes I 
only know a sentences, but at 
least I know part of a story. The 
story of an American living here, 
in New York City.
My city.
Sometimes the stories dont 
end as pleasantly as wed like. 
Sometimes they end like a fairy 
tale. It's not my place to judge.
Im just one good, proud, 
strong, American living here 
in New York City.
My city.
Sometimes I might help 
write a happy ending to a story. 
Sometimes I might help begin 
a new story. Sometimes I just 
read the footnotes to a story 
that happened a longtime ago, 
in New York City.
My city.
Sometimes I check a storys 
spelling, sometimes its gram
mar. Maybe, Ill neaten up the 
printing, or put it into a color
ful looseleaf binder. Some
times all I do is draw doodles 
in the margins with a felt tip 
pen, but Im there. Im there 
with all the good strong, firm, 
proud, pure Americans who 
live in New York City.
My city.
Its a dirty job, and when 
people ask me why I do it, I say 
to them. Hey, Im just one of 
many proud, firm, good, pure, 
strong, patriotic, pioneering 
Americans who live in New 
York City.
My city.
Thats my story. Not a very 
pretty one, is it, but I like it. 
Who am I? Im just a guy, a guy 
living in New York City.
My city.

accept th e disorder before it can be 
discarded. People who are viewed 
as having it all together all the 
time often find it hard to accept 
that they need help profession
ally. Often, in therapy, people will 
try to be star patients just as 
they are star students and model 
children. Recovery takes time. It 
is necessary to stop blaming one
self for having a problem. It takes
time to learn to look at food in a 
healthy manner. It takes time 
and patience to find the right 
program oftherapy. At the Coun
seling Center, the counselers are 
flexible and will try to work out 
with the patient a program that 
suits each individual. Some 
people stay at the Counseling 
Center, some go to Western Psy
chiatric Institute or West Penn 
Hospital where they have spe
cialists and programs set up for 
eating disorders. Often it takes 
more than one try to find a situ
ation in which you can work 
comfortable. To anyone who is 
struggling, be patient. It will be, 
worth the effort.
The Counseling Center is open 
Mon. to Fri. from 8:30 am to 5:06

Dont bother checking the spring course 
schedule; the lecture of the year will not 
be included. For all of the lectures you 
were forced to attend, AB offers one that 
youll want to attend. This lecture is not 
about how to get an excellent job, or how 
to choose an appropriate grad school; in 
fact it has nothing to do with the CMU 
afterlife. This lecture is about something 
that really matters: rock n roll. On 
Monday AB will present 60s Rock: When 
the Music Mattered. The fun starts in 
the Ballroom at 8 pm.
Perhaps lecture is a misnomer.  60s 
Rock is billed as a multi-media presen
tation, which suggests that in addition 
to snatches of music the evening will also 
include samples of film, video, and possi
bly text. In any case the presentation 
promises tobe an exciting bombardment 
of images and music. The explosion will 
be choreographed by Barry Drake, a 
performer and songwriter himself.
Drakes  60s Rock will be more than 
a talk about the groups and their hits. It 
will also examine the contextofthe music 
by addressing various issues of the muchheralded and remembered decade. With
luck, Drake will not present the decade 
through rose-colored Lennon spectacles, 
but will instead build upon the music to 
create a discussion of the Sixties for 
what they really were  a decade of 
contradictions and confusion as well as 
rebel youth and social consciousness.
Barry Drake has been interested (one 
might say obsessed) with rock n roll for 
a long time; he acquired his first rock n 
roll record back in 1954  almost before 
the term was coined. Yes, but is he 
experienced? you ask. His credentials 
seem to be in order. He managed to 
experience quite a few significant points 
along the classic music chronology. For 
example, he happened to be on the streets 
of San Francisco during the Summer of 
Love. During that same year (1967) he 
was back on the East Coast to catch Jimi 
Hendrix and Janis Joplin at the Fillmore 
East, the counterpart to Bill Grahams 
other famous Fillmore.
It is possible that Drakes fascination 
with music made him no different from 
anyone else aware of the music scene 
back in the Sixties. What differentiates 
Drake is that his obsession did not wane 
as he and the decade matured. He chose 
to make music his career and landed a 
contract with CBS Records in the midSixties. He has since recorded three 
albums, and he has toured both the 
United States and Europe. In addition, 
he provides management and booking 
services and runshis own recordinglabel.
It will be interesting to see whether 
Drake comments on the wave of nostal
gia and revival currently sweeping the 
country. Though the number of analyti
cal books and retrospective films seems 
to be waning, one cannot deny the last
ing preoccupation and fascination with 
the Sixties.
Those of us who only caught a glimpse 
of the tail-end of the decade through the 
bars of our cribs or over the edges of our 
baby carriages sometimes appear to re
member the events more thoroughly than 
our parents. What we remember, 
however, is not a collection of facts, but a 
collection of editorial images and sum
maries. While there are important les
sons to be learned from history, it is also 
important that the history be accurate. 
Equal attention should be given to the 
underlying problems as well as the ways 
in which people chose to deal with them. 
 60s Rock and lectures of its kind pro
vide an opportunity to reach a better 
understanding of a significant time in 
America.

Tartan Asst. Diversions Editor
As I approached the theater, a 
spotlight was scanning the sky 
and paperboys were screaming 
Extra! Extra! Read all about it! 
My partner and I walked towards 
the front door and knocked. A 
small hole opened and a man in a 
rough voice asked for the pass
word. Swordfish, I said. The 
peephole closed. Slowly the door 
opened, and my partner and I 
walked inside. Looking around, 
we saw that the women were 
dressed like flappers, the men 
looked like gangsters, and people 
were dancing the Charleston.
Am I describing a speakeasy 
from the 1920s? No, Im talking 
about the crowd at the Regent 
Theater in East Liberty last Sat
urday night.
The theater was the site of a 
1920s theme party which kicked 
off the beginning of the restora
tion of the districts next-to-last 
moviehouse. East Liberty Devel
opment Inc., anon-profit commu
nity development organization, 
has been trying for several years 
to get people interested in bring
ing the Regent back to life.
The restoration of the theater 
will cost an estimated $2.6 mil
lion. To make it a state-of-the-art 
performing arts center for dance, 
music, and theater, the Regent 
needsnew offices, dressingrooms, 
seats, carpeting, a roof, a stage, 
as well as hundreds of other small 
details.
Once the 450 seat theater is 
completely renovated, Carnegie 
Mellon Drama will manage the 
theater and be the main tenant. 
Other groups will be allowed to 
rent the theater on nights that 
CMU is not performing. CMU 
hopes to raise $1.8 million by the 
end of the year, looking mostly to 
alumni for contributions. The 
fundrasing is going along quite 
well, according to people at the 
event. Just a few days ago, some
one offered to build a new roof for 
the Regent.
Saturday nights party, origi
nally planned to be open to the 
public, was by invitation only due 
to the demand for tickets. The 
lavish party, intended to raise 
$100,000, was attended mostly 
by community business people 
and friends of the theater.
The event began with the 
speakeasy, where people in
1920s-era costumes walked 
around and a jazz band pumped 
out some classic tunes.
Next came the highlight of the 
evening, the vaudeville revue. 
There were seven acts in total, 
the first one being a musical and 
dance number, It Dont Mean A 
Thing, which was performed by 
the Glorious Rebirth Performing 
Troupe. The next act was The 
Medicine Man, who tried to sell 
the audience some of his snake 
oil and miracle elixir. Members 
of the Point Park College Dancers 
then entertained the audience 
with a great Charleston dance 
number.
The most enjoyable act by far 
was Combat Breakfast, which was 
performed by CMUs own Tim 
Cariyer and Babs Bailey. Both 
Carryer and Bailey are teachers 
in movement and improvisation 
at CMU, and they own a small 
theater company in Manhattan. 
Their act, which included throwingdinner rolls into the audience, 
swordfighting, and Skipper (their 
dog) dancing, brought the entire 
house down with laughter.
The audience was again treated 
to performers from CMU as three 
songs were sung from Maybe Im
Doing it Wrong. Next came more 
CMU performers: Don Marinelli 
(associate head of the Drama 
Department) and Victor Gordon 
(Drama Department secretary) 
acted out Abbott and Costellos 
classic Who's on First. Neither 
Marinelli or Gordon knew their 
lines perfectly, and both had to 
read from a script, but they were 
nonetheless quite funny.
The show was concluded with a 
song and dance number, Some
one to Watch Over Me and Up
town, Downtown, performed by 
Lindel Gum and Mary Miller 
Dance Company.
Once the vaudeville revue was 
over, everyone was treated to a 
midnight breakfast courtesy of 
Hotlicks. Finally, after everyone 
finished eating, there was an 
auction for the benefit of the 
Regents renovation.
It is unknown if the proposed 
$100,000 wasraised.butone thing 
is for sure. If the Regent is going 
to continue to host shows like the 
one seen Saturday night, it will 
be renovated in record time. If 
you would be interested in con
tributing to the restoration of the 
Regent Theater, you can contact 
the Drama Department.

Pittsburgh Playhouse presents Japanese comedy
'lt,8VuoH PNtpN9I 6goHe PIteoMIZ Il4 TxoMI 'uIMeHI 6io2eMo PmxI9ouoZ tuINM up8mH tet,8Vut 'l A Taxing Womans Return.
By TERRI KASCH
I Tartan Staffwriter
; Over the next several weeks 
; the Pittsburgh Playhouse will 
; offer the opportunity for two eve: nings of smart, humorous enter! tainment. First, A Taxing 
! Womans Return will play at the 
'theater until November 2. Fol
lowing that run, The Second 
Animation Celebration  The 
; Movie will play for one week only.
America may have Steven 
! Spielberg and Ron Howard, but 
Japan has no cause for envy be
cause ithas its own directing whiz.
 His name is Juzo Itami and his 
latest effort, A Taxing Womans 
Return, has arrived in the States 
after tremendous success in 
Itamis home country.
The film follows the character 
of Ryoko Itakura, who was first 
introduced to audiences in the 
1987 release of A Taxing Woman. 
Ryoko, described by Itami as a 
regular female Bogart, works as 
a tax inspector. For her next as
signment, she must investigate a 
religious organization suspected 
of being merely a ruse for ram
pant tax offenses. The two reli
gious leaders, Chief Elder Teppei 
Onizawa and the Holy Matriarch 
Kinu Akaha, oversee a large cult 
following. Both figures have vices 
to hide: Onizawa has two mis
presses and heads a corrupt eviction plan, and Akaha has a fetish 
for fur coats that run around 50 
million yen a pop.
Ryoko must find a way to un
cover this corruption and arrest 
these leaders for tax evasion. As a 
religious organization, the pair 
are exempt from taxes and do not 
have to account for the millions of 
yen that they receive. When 
asked, both claim that their funds 
come from private donations and 
sales of religious paraphernalia.
Actually, the two are mixed up in 
a giant plan to evict families from 
their homes and subsequently 
acquire more land, the most valu
able asset in Japan.
In order to carry out this plan, 
Onizawa sends out a team of his 
heavies, led by the greasy weasel 
Shorty Masa. Those families who 
do not leave their homes or apart
ments are subjected to threats 
and harassments. For one resi
dent, a sensationalist journalist, 
Onizawa orders one of his men to 
Call 1000 times a day.
If Onizawa can manage to get 
rid of all the tenants, he can sell 
the building to developers for a 
huge profit while laundering this 
money through his religion. Oni
zawa must also keep the politi
cians happy so he manages to 
juggle the incoming money so that 
everyone gets a share with no 
taxes.
Much of the plot contains ele
ments that have become stan
dards in American theaters. 
However, Itami approaches the 
material in such an original way 
that audience members will feel 
as if they have never seen these 
ideas before. For example, the 
story pairs Ryoko with a young 
Tokyo U graduate who tries to get 
by on the prestige of his univer
sity rather than his own merits. 
Sure, everyone has seen a film in 
which two people with opposing 
personalities are forced to work 
together, but wait. Dont expect 
any romances or petty arguments 
between these ,two. Ryoko in
stantly establishes herself as boss 
and her new assistant dutifully 
complies.
More importantly, this movie 
never becomes the predictable 
story of the brilliant heroes 
against the painfully stupid crimi
nals. Each move made by one side 
must be countered by an equally
clever move from the other side. 
Several of Onizawas associates 
complicate matters by taking the 
blame for crimes committed by 
the leader himself. No one gives 
up anything until he or she has 
exhausted every last possibility 
for escape.
Itami proves himself to be a 
master of special effects. In a 
compelling dream sequence, Oni
zawa stands at the base of a stag
gering, sheer rock cliff and singlehandedly tries to keep the struc
ture from collapsing. Scenes like 
this also reveal the human side of 
Onizawa. He is not just a ruthless 
tyrant but also a desperate, often
pathetic man. During a raid con
ducted by the tax inspectors, 
Onizawa stands in a bathrobe 
holding a plate of eggs. When he 
hears the alarm he plants his face 
in his breakfast and eats frantic
ally. Seconds later, he runs from 
the building with yolk smeared 
across his chin.
Even the smallest roles are 
strong in this movie. Mansaku 
Fuwa delivers a playfully devious 
performance as Shorty Masa and 
Noriko Murai has a brief, memo
rable appearance as a bubbly 
masseur. People may cry nepo
tism when they learn that Nobuko 
Miyamoto (Ryoko) is married to
Itami, but she is flawless in the 
title role. Finally, as Onizawa, 
Rentaro Mikuni perfectly conveys 
his characters mix of greed and 
pain.
Itami has created a masterpiece 
that blends fascinating charac
ters, intriguing dialogue and 
plenty of humor. The taxing 
woman has made a triumphant 
return.
The Second Animation Celebra
tion, opening on November 3 at 
the Playhouse, provides nearly 
two hours of animated shorts. The 
films include The Simpsons, a 
cartoon send-up of the modem 
nuclear family from Matt Groening, creator of the popular Life 
In Hell comic strip. The Simpsons1 
originated as a small feature on 
the popular Fox network variety 
series The Tracey Ullman Show. 
The Celebration also includes 
John Lassiters computer-ani
mated short film, Tin Toy, which; 
won the Academy award for Best 
Animated Short in 1988. The 
Playhouse warns that while this 
film is not rated, many of the 
cartoons are geared toward ma
ture audiences.

Look Whos Talking pIl4N84 2I4Nx
By STEPHEN GLICKER
Tartan Asst. Diversions Editor
Sometimes while Im watching 
movies I wonder if the script was 
written before or during the film
ing. After seeing Look Whos 
Talking I would have to say that 
it falls into the latter category.
Its a shame that this movie 
was such a disappointment, be
cause the opening scene, a close 
up of hundreds of sperm in search 
iof an egg while the Beach Boys 
tune I Get Around is playing in 
the background, was so funny. 
The film just goes downhill after 
,that.
Kirstie Alley plays Mollie, a 
Single working mother in her mid30s who becomes pregnant by her 
married lover (George Segal) and 
decides to have the baby. She also 
decides to find a proper father for 
her child, since her lover isnt 
about to leave his wife.
; Later in the film, as Alley goes 
into labor and hops into a cab, she 
just happens to bump into John 
Travolta, the cab driver. Not only 
does Travolta get her to the hospi
tal on time, but he coaches her 
through the entire delivery. What 
a great guy!
Next to enter this mess is Bruce 
Willis, or should I say the voice of 
Willis. He plays the conscience of 
Mikey, Alleys newborn baby. 
Whatever Mikey is thinking at 
the time we hear through the voice 
of Willis.
Over the course of the next few 
pionths, Alley desperately tries 
to find the perfect father for Mikey 
(but can only seem to find total 
jerks for some reason), while 
Travolta is hanging around baby 
sitting and male-bonding with 
Mikey. Can you guess just how 
long it takes before Alley finally 
realizes what a great guy Trayolta is and marries him? Around 
an hour or so.
If you think the story is bad, be 
forewarned: the actingisnotmuch

better. Alley is the best thing in 
this movie. She gives the audi
ence a few good laughs, has one 
great line during her delivery 
scene, and is especially funny in 
her fantasy sequences through
out the movie.
I dont know what rock Tra
volta has hidden under for the 
last ten years or so, but maybe he 
should go back. Time has not been 
kind to Travolta, and over the 
years he has put on quite a bit of 
weight. As for his acting, all he 
does in this movie is hang around 
Mikey, listen to Alley complain 
about her terrible dates, and drive 
a cab. Definitely prime father 
material.
The biggest question I have is; 
why on earth did they choose 
Willis as the voice for Mikey? It is 
difficult at times to picture Willis 
deep, coarse voice coming from 
the mind of an infant. Willis is 
funny; its just that the voice 
doesnt match the body.
Finally we have the direction 
and screenwriting of Amy Heckerling. Her past movies include 
Johnny Dangerously and Na
tional Lampoons European Va
cation. I honestly think that all 
Heckerling did was write part of 
the script, film those parts, film 
Mikey running around doing 
strange things, and then add 
Willis voice to somehow make
Mikeys actions seem funny. 
Heckerling didnt do a horrible 
job directing, but there is no Oscar 
material here.
All in all, Look Whos Talking is 
sometimes funny, but it is mostly 
just annoying to watch. Unfortu
nately the best parts of the movie 
occur in the very beginning and 
the very end, thereby forcing you 
to watch everything in between. I 
would see it during the matinee, 
but would never want to pay full 
price.
Look Wh os Talking is rated PG13, and is playing at the Galleria, 
Cranberry, Cheswick, Southland, 
and all Showcase cinemas.5I98t 65opl gHIaoNuIZ IYImut I Mmtt nHo9 PoNNm8

My buddy Buster Peebles, who 
was the first rancher in Texas to 
invest all his life savings in llama 
breeding, was back in town last 
week for the State Fair, begging 
me to go with him to look at some 
ostrich opportunities. Have you 
heard about this? Its the latest 
thing for guys like Buster to start 
selling back and forth to one 
another. So we went to the ostrich 
show to see why, after all these 
years of ranching, Buster still 
didnt have any 300-pound birds 
with legs like baseball bats walk
ing around on his ranch.
Buster, I told him, Im not 
spending one dime on any ostrich 
ranching.
And he said, Thats whats 
wrong with you, Joe Bob. All you 
care about is boring, traditional 
animals like cows, sheep, goats. I 
guess you want us to just keep 
buying more cows, sheep, and 
goats. I guess thats your idea of a 
progressive, modem ranch.
And I told him, Oh, I see your 
point, Buster, those animals have 
only been making money for about 
six, seven thousand years. Youre 
right. Theyre gonna go out of 
style any day now.
So Buster just snorted at me 
and led me over to the special 
State Fair Ostrich Display where 
there was a mating trio, three 
birds that looked like roosters that 
were sprayed with Agent Orange 
and stuffed in a giant vat of Or
ville Kedenbachers microwave 
popcorn until their necks shot up 
out of their bodies like squishy Qtips.
Very handsome animals, 
Buster, but Ive never heard of a 
mating trio.
Theyre kinky little rascals, 
said Buster.
I was afraid hed explain, so I 
changed the subject. And about 
then, the owner of the prize os
triches, Lou Feinstein of Sallisaw, Oklahoma, walked up. Lou 
is the only Jewish farmer in his 
part of Oklahoma. Actually, he 
gave up most of his farm to be
come an ostrich broker.
Its the wave of the future, 
said Lou as we stood there staring 
at their fat shiny necks. Its the 
largest bird in the world. I clocked 
one of these ostriches at 42 miles 
per hour  faster than my 
pickup. And he slapped me on 
the back. I told him, in the future, 
to slap Buster Peebles on the back, 
because Busters the one who 
would be buying ostriches.
Wave of the future, Lou said 
again.
All right, I said, I guess I 
might as well go ahead and ask. 
What are they good for?
What are they good for? Lou 
said. What are they good for? 
He laughed. Buster laughed, too, 
so I had to wait for the hysteria to 
die down.
What are they good for? I said. 
Some of the finest boots in the 
world, Lou said. Ostrich skin. 
Ladies shoes. Belts. Luggage. 
You put 350 pounds of feed in 
this bird to make a belt?
And, of course, the feathers. 
European knights wore ostrich 
plumes. Very fashionable in Eu
rope.
Okay, that sews up the Euro
pean knight market. Then weve 
got your ostrich-skin pumps 
probly sell twenty, thirty thou
sand of those to American Air
lines stewardesses. What else? 
You ever see one of those fancy 
Easter eggs like Andy Warhol 
used to make? Ostrich egg. Larg
est egg in the world.
Oh! Wow! Okay, now youre 
talking. That brings in the New 
York art market and the Euro
pean knights.
But those are all just extras, 
said Lou. You wanna know what 
were really doing with these 
birds?
Lou waited a 
minute. I leaned 
forward. Buster 
leaned so far for
ward he looked like 
an ostrich.
Health food of 
the nineties, said 
Lou. I kid you not. 
Ostrich meat. Twice the protein 
of beef, but fewer calories, fewer 
carbohydrates, less fat, less cho
lesterol. You ever hear of an os
trich getting a heart attack? 
Never! said Buster.
One dressed ostrich will yield 
about 125 pounds of red meat, 
said Lou.
And let me guess, I said. It 
tastes exactly like chicken. 
Nope, said Lou. Thats what 
youd think, isnt it? No, its more 
like milk-fed prime veal.
Do you think its too late to get 
in on this? Buster said.
Buster! I was doing my best. 
Have you paid for all those lla
mas yet?
But Buster could no longer hear 
me.
Too late? said Lou. Too late! 
Youre my first customer today, 
Mr. Peebles.
Just one more question, I said. 
Lou looked at me like You screw 
this up and Ill feed you to an 
ostrich.
And the question is, what are 
ostriches being sold for, right now, 
in 1989, at the Texas State Fair? 
Not in the future. Right now. 
Primarily, said Lou, the os
triches produced in the United 
States today are sold for breeding 
purposes.
Yall are just trading em back 
and forth, one to another, arent 
you?
But by that time, Buster was 
whipping out his checkbook. As 
they walked away, arm in arm, I 
could hear Buster saying So tell 
me about this mating trio busi
ness.
And Lou said, Mr. Peebles, 
what you might prefer is a mating 
quartet, or perhaps a full orches
tra...

~ for thirteen years Garrison Keilb lor opened his weekly radio show, 
A Prairie Home Companion, with
- that song. Keillor will be bringing 
n rbhe unique combination of music,
humor, and storytelling that made 
. the show so popular to Pittsburgh 
: in a concert entitled Lake Wobe
gon Loyalty Days.
The concert, under the direc
tion of Philip Brunelle, a longtime companion of Keillors, will 
open the 1989-90 Pittsburgh 
'Symphony Pops season November 4 to 6 at Heinz Hall. The per:fbrmance promises to showcase 
' the talents which have made 
Keillor one of the most-loved 
-performers in America.
- A Prairie Home Companion, 
broadcast every Saturday night
- from St. Paul, Minnesota on 
^National Public Radio from 1974 
tb 1987, consisted of a potpourri 
! of music and skits. What the show 
^is best remembered for, though, 
: re Keillors stories of Lake Wobe- gon, Minnesotathe little town 
that time forgot.
Many talented musicians vis
ited the show each week, repre
senting the best in traditional 
Country, classical, and vocal 
-music. Interspersed with the
* music were skits performed by
 'Keillor, his guests, and a talented
 repertory of regulars, usually 
1 poking fun at movies and televivmon.
'1 Each week at some point durT:ihg the show Keillor delivered 
iThe News from Lake Wobegon,
consisting of the latest happen
ings in the tiny Lutheran town. 
Once the stories got going Keillor 
would soon reminisce about his 
own youth, telling of an event 
that had happened to him, or 
trying to convey a simple mes
sage about life.

Prairie Home Companion creator/host 
Garrison Kefiior.
Keillors talent lies in his abil
ity to fully capture the attention 
and imagination of an audience. 
Whether hes talking about the 
towns one traffic light, Ralphs 
Grocery, the faint essence of tuna 
hotdish at the Chatterbox Cafe, 
or the seemingly ever-present 
snow, Keillors gentle voice is in 
control. When he has built the 
tension up to its high point, when 
there is total silence in the audi
torium, he drops a little joke, 
causing a wave of- appreciative 
laughter from the listeners.
His brand of humor is not hi
larious; rather, it is true to life. 
Keillor takes everyday occur
rences, exaggerates them a little, 
and in so doing, makes us laugh.
In addition to his success on 
the radio, Keillor has written 
several articles and three books, 
the most popular being Lake 
Wobegon Days, a portrait of the 
town he created.
In 1987, Keillor ended A Prai
rie Home Companion, saying he 
was tired of the weekly 
grind and wanted to 
spend more time with 
his wife, Ulla Skaerved. 
Except for a yearly re
union special, fans have 
had to make do with 
repeats of old shows 
since then. Although 
talks of a new show are 
in the air, nothing hasi
 materialized yet.
Lake Wobegon Loy
alty Days will feature all 
the most popular parts 
of the radio show, in^ eluding Hello Love, 
I Some Words About 
I Powdermilk Biscuits, 
and, of course, News 
from Lake Wobegon. 
Since it is a Pops con
cert, the music will be 
classical, but in a very 
Keillorian way. Musical features 
include Piano and Orchestra 
Bench Overture and The Young 
Lutherans Guide to the Orches
tra.
For those who already know 
and love Garrison Keillor, as well 
as for those who have yet to dis

lute must. Tickets will go very 
quickly, so get them now.

P.J. McArdle Productions'? 
You may have heard of it; youve 
probably even been to some 
events its produced. If not, nows 
a good time to start. I was hav

McArdle) himself the other day 
and he gave me the scoop on the 
upcoming events. Okay, so we

Pittsburgh Record Fair
If you have some extra funds 
lying around and you feel the 
urge to indulge your passion for 
music, you will of course ven
ture out to the Pittsburgh Rec
ord Fair. The Fair will be held 
next Sunday at the Howard 
Johnsons in Monroeville. Here 
you will be free to wander 
around gaping over a tremen
dous selection of LPs (despite 
rumors, not all of the vinyl plat
ters have been willed to muse
ums), CDs, cassettes, videos 
and posters. You can lose your
self in all kinds of memorabilia
and stuff. And the most exciting 
aspect of all of this is that you can 
actually purchase the lost final 
recording of (insert your all time 
favorite band here) or whatever 
else captures your eye, or ear.
The Fairs selection will include 
samples of practically every type 
of music known to Pittsburgh  
there will be more variety than on 
a free form college radio station. 
(Well, probably.) Of course you 
dont have to buy anything. It is 
possible just to spend the whole 
day soaking up the atmosphere 
and listening to enthusiastic 
music lovers. The Fair will run 
from 10 am until 5 pm, so you can 
sleep in after your rambunctious 
Saturday night.
Sound Garden
Yeah, I know what youre think
ing. Recorded musics fine, but 
what you really need is a live 
show, with a fresh, somewhat 
undiscovered band. Youre in luck. 
P.J. McArdle Productions second 
happening is just the thing for 
you. Its an all-ages show at the 
Upstage featuring Sound Garden. 
The band has been described as 
sort of a trash metal band, often 
compared to Zeppelin. The Up
stage is in Oakland (3609 Forbes) 
and as their advertisement boasts, 
is under new management.
Sound Garden will perform 
Monday, November 13.
10,000 Maniacs
10,000 Maniacslatest release, 
Blind Mans Zoo, is cool (and a 
bunch of other neat adjectives, 
like thought-provoking, smooth, 
and excellent). Theyre hitting 
the road to support the new 
album, and P.J. McArdle Pro
ductions is bringing them to 
Pittsburgh. The show will be 
Thursday, December 14 at the 
Syria Mosque. The wonderful 
thing about the Mosque is that 
practically every seat offers a 
rewarding view of the stage, and 
the venue is within walking 
distance of campus. The open
ing act is still being determined, 
but McArdle mentioned Miracle 
Legion as a possibility. (You may 
have caught them at their re
cent Pittsburgh gig.) Tickets for 
the Maniacs should be avail
able soon; there was no definite 
information at press time. At 
any rate, the show sounds like 
a great way to reward yourself 
for excellent performance on fi
nals, or perhaps as a sort of con
solation prize.
Watch upcoming issues of The 
Tartan for information on fu
ture P.J. McArdle events.

My Life as a Dog
Between this film and last weeks showing of 
Harold and Maude, AB Films has bombarded CMU 
with enough dark psychological humor to send Her
cules running for his analyst. My Life as a Dog, a 
European import, sits somewhere on the border be
tween fanciful nostalgia and psychotic delirium. The 
film depicts the trials of adolescence as experienced 
by Ingemar, a detached, contemplative, and argua
bly insane 12-year-old boy living in mid-century 
Sweden. With his mother dying of tuberculosis, 
Ingemar is sent to live in a countryside town. There 
he encounters a variety of bizarre and eccentric 
characters, finds solace in comparing his personal 
traumas to tabloid disaster stories, and drops to all 
fours and barks in times of stress. Certainly appeal
ing to the avant garde crowd.

RoboCop
If you havent seen this movie then theres some
thing intrinsically wrpng with you. RoboCop is a 
spectacular science-fiction thriller that embodies a 
masterful union of Spielbergesque action, chilling 
drama, and offbeat humor. When a likable, clean-cut 
cop (Peter Weller) is mauled by hoodlums, he is 
transformed into a high-tech, justice-dealing cyborg 
who proceeds to lay waste to the criminals of a 
futuristic Detroit. The movie is exciting and intense 
without being bogged down by the seriousness that 
plagues most films of this genre, and the exhilarating 
soundtrack grabs hold of your central nervous sys
tem and doesnt let go. See this movie, or well have 
you shot.

Cousins
Cousins is an Americanization of the 1970s French 
comedy Cousin, Cousine, that replaces the lively 
mischievousness of its predecessor with bland Holly
wood whitewash and recycled milk-and-cookies 
emotions. Despite the overtones of dreary romantic 
simplicity, there is enough wit and sympathetic 
sentiment here, however muffled, to sustain those 
who enjoy this sort of thing. Ted Danson and Isabella 
Rossellini play the titular cousins, victims of their 
charmingly contemptible adulterous spouses, and 
proceed to fall predictably in love with one another. 
Not particularly distinct or memorable, but easily 
worth the dollar.

From Russia with Love
You know, after years of watching the increasingly 
decrepit Roger Moore wheeze over beautiful seductresses one tenth his age, its nice to leap back in time 
and see Bond as he was meant to be: young, virile, on 
the go, and portrayed by Sean Connery. Armed with 
this distinction, you may now safely watch this film, 
secure in the knowledge that youre in for a night of 
action-drenched espionage, devious villains, nym
phomaniacal lust (all for the good of her Majestys 
national security, of course) and everything else that 
characterizes this classic line that we know so well. 
The plot is intricate, the action intense, and for once 
Connery doesnt look like he should be drinking 
Geritol. Good, clean, violent fun. Go see it.

The Pittsburgh jazz scene is 
alive today with jazz guitar. The 
city itself is home to quite a few 
talents, such as Joe Negri, Ken 
Karsh, and Eric Suesoff. But 
beyond local talent, the city also 
attracts a number of excellent 
national acts.
Now Pittsburgh has Larry 
Carlton, who will be appearing at 
Graffiti on Friday for two shows 
only, at 7:30 pm and 10:30 pm. 
Carlton is returning to Pittsburgh 
after only a brief absence, for he 
was here this summer as part of 
the Mellon Jazz Festival.
Carltons infectious guitar play
ing has made him one of the most 
respected musicians in the indus
try and has garnered him two 
Grammy Awards, one of which
was for his collaboration with 
Mike Post on the Hill Street Blues 
theme.
One year ago Carlton was bru
tally wounded outside his Los 
Angeles-area studio. He has re
covered completely, and is able to 
play again. He has now dedicated 
himself to an organization which 
he helped form, called Helping 
Innocent People (HIP). The 
organizations function is to as
sist victims of violent crimes.

The Tubes are sure to cause 
dissent among the editors of the 
unwritten Annals of Rock. When 
some slobs finally do get around 
to writing this chimerical tome, 
not only will they have to contem
plate the significance of the Knack 
(a thankless burden), but also the 
proper position of more elusive 
bands like San Franciscos Tubes.
The Tubes affinity for elabo
rate and visually spectacular live 
performances, as well as a play
fully subversive set list including 
White Punks on Dope and 
Mondo Bondage, has been off
set by a sadly lackluster output 
during the latter part ofthe bands 
career. People's pan of the bands 
early eighties release, Outside In
side, typifies the ambivalence 
recent Tubes records have elic
ited in critical circles. People 
praises the bands charming and 
disarming flair for social satire, 
but ultimately reduces the album 
to a blurry mush of derivative
kitch (which could be used to 
describe People).
The latter half of the Tubes 
dichotomypart show band, part 
shlock-rock outfit  should be 
disregarded by those interested 
in witnessing a truly strange and 
delightfully shocking perform
ance next Monday at Graffiti. Few 
will be disappointed by the Tubes 
creative staging of Shes a 
Beauty, Talk to You Later and 
Wild Women of Wongo. All that 
the band may lack on vinyl be
comes secondary when they es
cape the constraints of a studio 
and take to the stage.
Let an unfortunate future rock 
historian (a position of dubious 
honor and questionablenecessity) 
wrestle with the Tubes legacy. 
Until the Annals of Rock are 
completed, bide your time enj oyably at the Tubes show next week. 
It might be a long wait.
Advance tickets for the Tubes 
are $12 and can be purchased at 
all National Record Mart outlets, 
Oasis, Kaufmanns, Record Vil
lage and Graffitis box office.
cian and soloist, 
is one ofthe fin
est guitarists in 
the genre of 
jazz-pop. He has 
appeared on 
over 100 gold 
albums as a 
session player, 
playing with such diverse person
alities as Jerry Garcia, Linda 
Ronstadt, Michael Jackson, John 
Lennon, and Herb Alpert.
His first solo album on Warner 
Brothers, entitled Larry Carlton, 
was released on the heels of his 
debut session with super-group 
Steely Dan. After four albums 
with Warner Brothers, Carlton 
was dropped from the label, but 
he was picked up by MCA Rec
ords. His first album on his new 
label, the acoustic outing Alone! 
But Never Alone, was chosen as 
the No. 1 album on the Radio and 
Records and Billboard charts.
With his new album, On Solid 
Ground, Carlton breaks new 
ground. Here he records his first 
cover of a Steely Dan tune; that 
song is Josie. When I looked 
into adding a Steely Dan tune to 
one of my albums, I went through 
their catalog and Josie looked 
like the one that would be the 
most fun to put on a Lariy Carlton 
album," Carlton said.
The other cover on this album is 
Layla, with the albums other 
eight songs being Carlton origi
nals. This album shows Carlton 
in peak form, playing with the 
technical prowess that he is 
known for. If the record is any in
dication, his live show should be 
very exciting.
While Im on the subject of gui
tarists, I thought that I would 
mention a couple of recent re
leases by two of jazz best, John 
Scofield and Mike Stem.
With Flat Out John Scofield 
changes the direction that he has 
taken on his last two albums (Blue 
Matter and Loud Jazz). Opening 
with the infectious beat of Cissy 
Strut, Scofield leads us through 
his interpretation of acoustic jazz.
He creates a sound that is com
pletely new, showing us how to 
take the music beyond its tradi
tional confines. He plays some 
bebop licks, but he transcends 
that form as he transcends the 
others.
The musicians are extremely 
tight and the music is powerful. 
Divided evenly between covler 
tunes and originals, this recoM 
gives us Scofield at his best, both 
playing and composing. Id have 
to say that this is his best album 
yet.
On the long-awaited Jigsaw, 
Mike Stem  maybe the most 
exciting live guitarist today . 
continues in the tradition of his 
last two albums (Upside Down
side and Time in Place). The songs 
are once again catchy grooves 
which act as showcases for his 
virtuoso playing, though the stu
dio does not do justice to his skill.
Rhythmic syncopations are still 
the characterizing elements of a 
Stem composition, making the 
music jazzy andfunky at the same 
time. Included on the album are 
Jeff Andrews (electric and fretless 
bass), Bob Berg (tenor sax), Jim 
Beard (keyboards), and Peter 
Erskine (drums). Also included 
on two tracks are the amazing 
chops of Dennis Chambers, the 
most exciting drummer in the 
world. One live show with him 
will leave you speechless.
Berg offers some of his best 
playing yet on this record, as does 
Erskine. Highlights include 
Stems screaming solo on Loose 
Ends and everybodys playing on 
the straight-ahead Kwirk. All 
of the compositions were written 
by Stern, but there just arent 
enough ofthem (there are only six 
songs on the album  about 18 
minutes per side). But dont let 
yourself be swayed by lack 6f 
material, because this is an excel
lent album. Stem fans and those 
who love soloists should rush out 
and buy the album now  tlie 
rest of you can wait a week.

Decisions, decisions
Those of us in our freshman year at CMU 
have just survived several harrowing years of 
important decisions. With time to breathe and 
revel in having made a good choice for college 
(or bemoan the mistake of choosing a bad one) 
we can scarcely comprehend that many of our 
fellow students are beginning to face an even 
more important decision: choosing a job.
The Career Center offers a number of 
suggestions for considering a job. Although 
Social Security, Unemployment Compensation 
and Workmen's Compensation are required by 
law, other benefits vary among positions. These 
may include:
Paid vacation (the length depending on 
how long one has worked for the company) 
Paid sick leave or disability benefits 
(including maternity leave)
Insurance: life, medical, or dental (often 
based on one's salary)
Retirement or pension plans 
Relocation benefits: cover the expenses of 
moving to employer's location.
Profit sharing: the opportunity to share in
  
profits earned by an employer.
Education benefits: covering the ex
penses for any additional job-training
Employee services such as free parking, 
reduced-cost travel, or rehabilitation programs
Credit unions: special financial services 
and counseling.
Performance bonus/commissions: 
generally for employees in sales who reach a 
certain amount.
Holiday gifts.
There are other important things to con
sider besides potential benefits  for example, 
the salary, the employer, the community, and 
the industry or field of work itself (whether it 
is expanding, whether there is room for 
upward movement, etc.).
The material above (from Finding a Job in 
the United States, 1986) is an example of the re
sources available from the Career Center  
resources which can be vital in making the 
next big decision of your life.

...students can 
use the summer 
placement services 
to find all kinds of 
jobs on-campus or 
anywhere in the 
United States.
W
How to spend your summer vacation
What are you doing this summer? Chances are, you're 
thinking about working. If you don't know where you're 
working, or if after last summer you're ready to think about 
something else, visit the Career Center.
The summer employment program has more to offer than 
you might expect. I spoke with Judith Mancuso, associate 
director of student employment, about what was available. 
Aside from getting experience and a head start on the corporate 
world, students can use the summer placement services to find 
all kinds of jobs on-campus or anywhere in the United States.
Of course, with so many options, you should have some 
idea where you'd like to work and what kind of job you want 
to have. You're free to pursue jobs outside of your major. 
Mancuso also made it clear that you should have one other 
thing before you start  the right approach. "It's the same as 
looking for a permanent job," she said. "You need a profes
sional outlook."
Getting started is easy; just go to the Career Center and ask 
about the summer employment program. You'll be given 
information on summer placement services and programs, 
along with a summer placement registration form. You'll have 
to give the office a completed registration form and 20 copies of 
your resume. If you don't have a resume prepared or if you feel 
unsure about the one you have, the Career Center also offers
counseling to help you develop a strong resume.
From there, Mancuso will help you find a job in the field 
and geographic area you've chosen. It's important to remem
ber, though, that the legwork is up to you. "Students shouldn't 
depend solely on the office to place them in jobs," she said. 
Although the office can help with and prepare you for the job 
search, you will have to pursue the job you want.
Once you've registered, you can participate in services like 
on-campus interviewing, forwarding your resume to employers 
who might be interested in interviewing you, and adding your 
resume to the resume books located in the office.
There are programs and events which are affiliated with 
the Career Center that can help you start moving in the right 
direction. On Tuesday, December 5, there will be a workshop 
on summer employment in Skibo 12 from 4:30 to 5:30. The Job 
Fair '90 will be coming to the Skibo Ballroom on February 21. 
Information on summer jobs from all over the country will be 
available, and you don't even have to sign up for anything 
just come to the Skibo Ballroom between 10 am and 3 pm.
For information on summer referral, placement, and em
ployment, just visit the Career Center. It's located in the base
ment of Warner Hall, and the phone number is x2064.

So, what do you want to be when you grow up?
Whether you are just starting college or getting ready to 
graduate, eventually you will be asked, "So, what do you want 
to do with your life?"
Deciding on a career, like deciding on your major, can be 
easy if you take some time to think and are open to ideas. As 
with most things on campus, the University provides help for 
decision making.
This is probably the most important decision you will ever 
make. Do not try to make it alone. Whatever career you choose 
will be your own, but you may not be prepared to make such a 
decision yet, or at least, on your own.
Everyone has been told by parents or friends that the most 
important thing is "to do what you enjoy." Career decision 
making is not that easy. Unfortunately, there are no such things 
as professional video game players or ultimate frisbee teams. 
Do not feel that you must get a job that pays a hundred thou
sand dollars a year. Everybody has different priorities and 
goals they want to achieve with their lives.
"I like writing, so maybe I'll be a journalist."
"Computer engineering provides a stable, secure future."
"I would like to be a doctor to help people."
"Through the arts, I could use and express my creativity."
These are all statements people make when thinking about 
possible careers. However, one must do much more soulsearching before making and acting upon a final decision.
The Career Center has career goal evaluations which can
help those who are unsure of what they want to do. These 
evaluations allow students to figure out for themselves what 
elements of a career are most important to them. For example, 
by ranking certain aspects of career benefits you may find out 
that helping individuals is more important to you than working 
on a larger scale and trying to serve society as a whole. Like
wise, you may discover yourself to be a very competitive 
person who enjoys pressure and win-lose situations. Such 
factors are important to know when deciding on a career, as 
well as in helping you better understand yourself.
These evaluation tests are very detailed and explicit. They 
range from helping you assess your personality to highlighting 
aspects of a specific job that may appeal to you. Some are even 
geared towards people with specific majors.
In addition to helping you learn about yourself, the Career 
Center can enlighten you about specific jobs and careers. Not 
having enough information about a career is an important 
hurdle to overcome. You may be gearing up for a specific 
career, but there is more to it than just what you are learning in 
class. Do not assume that because you are studying computer 
engineering, you will be cut out for any type of job dealing with 
computers. Some careers require a great deal of specialization, 
while others call for more diversification. Knowing the specifics 
of your career options is crucial.

Trends in the career market of today
The jobs that are 
available, even in 
entry level positions, 
require a higher 
level of training and 
education than those 
of the past.
 V
The current trends in the job market look pretty good for 
those of us soon to graduate from Carnegie Mellon and search 
for jobs. Recent developments have made it more common for 
employers to be fighting for graduates, rather than graduates 
fighting off a lot of competition. As America 'ages' because of a 
slowing birthrate, the stream of graduates and hence new 
employees slows. The demand for employees hasn't decreased, 
however, making young workers an increasingly rare and more 
valuable commodity.
Employers are not only searching for new workers, but are 
tending to demand educated and skilled workers. Many of the 
stepping stone jobs that were once entry level positions are 
being eliminated either by automation or by the relocation of 
companies to other countries that have cheap labor. Predictions 
about the biggest drop in job openings indicate that lower level 
manufacturing jobs for unskilled workers will decrease in 
number. On the other hand, the fastest growing number of jobs 
are those requiring the highest level of education and skill.
The jobs that are available, even in entry level positions, 
require a higher level of training and education than those of 
the past. Many employers complain that the potential employ
ees graduating from schools are not as well educated as in the

past. The combination of this failure of the schools and a trend 
toward an increase in the levels of skills required for job is 
forcing many employers to settle for hiring and then training 
unskilled workers.
One requirement of many applicants today is computer 
literacy. Even positions as basic as secretarial positions now 
require at least some experience with computers. The computer 
literate have many more opportunities in today's working 
world because they can adjust to a wider variety of working 
environments with less necessary training. Employers are 
demanding applicants familiar with areas other than computers 
also. An employee is much more useful if he or she has a basic 
knowledge of things such as finance and sales.
One industry that is benefiting from the lack of workers is 
personnel services. There is no longer an abundance of appli
cants waiting at the doorstep of employers. People are needed 
to seek out good help. The shortage of workers is causing 
companies to look towards groups of people they never tar
geted previously. Many more minorities, women and elderly 
people are being hired. Employers are also looking towards 
part time employees. Temporary agencies are becoming very 
popular as permanent help becomes harder to find.
Perhaps the most significant up and coming fields are those 
in the service industries. This is nothing radically new, but is a 
trend that has been continuing for some years. According to the 
New York Times, last year was the first year that service industry 
jobs outnumbered manufacturing jobs. In the coming years, the 
greatest projected number of job openings will be for retail 
sales people, registered nurses, janitors, cashiers and other 
service industry jobs.
One important field of service industries that seems to be 
lacking qualified employees is health services. Not only is there 
already a high demand for nurses, but there is a demand for 
health practitioners, medical assistants, physical therapists, 
podiatrists, and the list continues.
The growth in the service sector, as well as creating a 
need for service related workers, will increase the need for 
more highly educated workers to manage this sector.

Resume DOs and DONTs
1. DO make your name the dominant ele
ment at the top of the page. One way of empha
sizing it is by shrinking the addresses and 
placing the name higher on the page than any
thing else.
2. DON'T overdo the fonts or styles. Keep it 
simple.
3. DO make your career objective as specific 
as you can. Many people write up two different 
resumes for closely related fields.
4. DO be sure that tabs and indents line up 
properly.
5. DO mention only the most outstanding 
information about your high school career.
6. DO make sure to proofread carefully. Mis
spellings show carelessness.
7. DO use bullets and dashes to call particu
lar attention to entries. But don't overdo these 
visual signals  you want to save them for the 
information you really want to emphasize.
8. DO be consistent in your format. Consis
tency makes the resume easier to read. Half the 
list here is seperated by commas and the other 
half is seperated by dashes. A good form is "job
 place  date."
9. DO order your entries by importance or 
chronologically.
10. DO use shorter line lengths and left-justi
fied text to enhance legibility.
11. IX) avoid overcrowding your resume 
since it may be only briefly scanned by an em
ployer. If you need more space you may want to 
eliminate some of your related coursework.
12. IX) use active verbs.
13. DO describe your jobs in such a way that 
you emphasize responsibility.

RESUMES
12
U
A resume is a brief, 
but very important, 
summary of your 
background. With it, 
you sell yourself.
""" V
Dont put off til tomorrow 
what you should do today
Most people hate the thought of writing a resume, so they 
put it off until the last possible moment. However, it is impor
tant to get a rough draft done as soon as possible, because you 
will probably go back and rewrite it several times as you gain 
more experience. In preparing a resume, bear in mind that it 
will be only briefly scanned. The format should guide the eye to 
the key areas that address an employer's needs. Otherwise, it 
will be tossed aside. A resume is a brief, but very important, 
summary of your background. With it, you sell yourself. A 
resume can reveal these four qualities:
1. Activities, employment, and achievements illustrate 
industriousness and ambition.
2. Participation in activities, clubs, and sports speaks of a 
cooperative attitude.
3. A positive job objective or statement of career interest can 
reassure an employer of the candidate's interest in and enthusi
asm for the employer's product or service. Any courses, employ
ment, or activities that reflect that interest should be high
lighted on the resume.
4. A crisp, neat format reflects an orderly, businesslike mind. 
Types of Resumes
Resumes come in several basic types, but the two most 
common are chronological and functional.
A chronological resume is clear and easy to understand, as 
well as relatively simple to develop since the time scheme 
provides an uncomplicated way to organize information.
A disadvantage for anyone under 25 is that the information 
can look skimpy; you simply haven't lived long enough to have 
accumulated a long list of experiences.
A functional resume emphasizes abilities or interests. For 
example, you might include statements such as "excellent 
verbal skills," "highly interested in working with computers," 
or "able to type 60 words per minute" as opposed to a list of 
actual jobs held.
Other styles include narrative resumes, where you state 
everything in full sentences and paragraphs. For most students, 
functional resumes are the best bet, although combining 
features of two or more styles can be effective.
Writing Your Resume
To begin, your name should be at the top of the page, 
centered, and in large type. Your home address and phone 
number should go on the left hand side and your school 
address and phone number on the right hand side.
Next is your objective. This will be a brief statement indi
cating what kind of situation or position you are seeking. You 
don't have to be particularly specific about long-range plans, as 
long as the objective provides the reader with a clear idea of 
exactly what it is you want to be considered for.
In the next two sections, list your educational background 
and work experience, even if they were part-time or volunteer. 
It doesn't matter whether you include education first and then 
work experience, or vice versa. As a student, you have to em
phasize not just where you've been, but where you're going.
In the section on experience, list any employment, even if it 
was on a part-time, non-paid, or summer basis. If you held the 
position as an intern or a volunteer, you should definitely 
include it as further experience.
In the next section, list any activities or honors. Include 
academic honors, athletic recognition, music citations, or other 
awards. Anything that will help set you apart from the crowd is 
potentially useful. Along the same lines, include any leadership 
experience in clubs or other organizations. You may want to 
include hobbies or other interests, but some people prefer to 
omit this kind of personal information. If you choose to add it,
keep it brief, and include only those items which enhance an 
overall image of seriousness and competence.
At the end of the resume, it's a good idea to list references
 three or four people who know you and will give a good "re
port" about you if a potential employer or other interested 
person contacts them. Include their names, titles, business 
addresess, and telephone numbers. If you do not have room, 
simply state "references available upon request."
Final Touches
After you have organized all of your facts and written a 
first draft, go back over the resume and refine it so that every
thing is clear, well-stated, and accurate. Review the material to 
ensure that your word choices show a positive, dynamic 
approach. Make sure that everything is 100 percent correct in 
terms of grammar, punctuation, and spelling. Once your 
resume is typed, check it and re-check it for typos. Use wide 
margins, single spacing, and lots of "white space" with each 
section clearly labeled and headings in bold print. The resume 
should be no longer than one page. Once you have a neatly 
typed resume, get copies printed. Keep extras on hand for use 
whenever you apply for a job, or need to provide anyone with 
information about your background. Keep an extra copy to 
update as changes in your life occur. When you register at the 
Career Center, you can submit twenty copies of your resume to 
be mailed to employers who contact the Center with job 
vacancies. You can also start a credential file that will include 
documents such as letters of recommendation, transcripts, and 
test scores that will be mailed to prospective employers or 
graduate schools at your request.
A well-written resume is a valuable record that can be used 
over and over again. As you move forward with your planning, 
take full advantage of this basic career-development tool.

Making the most of job fairs
Job fairs are typically one-or-two-day-long events to which 
employers send several representatives from their companies.
If your grades aren't fantastic enough for the on-campus re
cruiters to notice you, job fairs can be a better way of making 
contact with a potential employer rather than simply sending in 
a resume. The companies represented at a job fair are usually 
small or local ones that can't afford to go to recruit at very 
many campuses.
You shouldn't casually show up for a job fair, however. 
Treat it as you would an interview. Come prepared. You 
should call ahead and get information about the companies that 
will be there. Dress professionally and act confident. These fairs 
are not always limited to students, so professionalism is crucial.
Once you're there, try to speak with every company even if 
they aren't advertising for entry level positions. Companies 
don't always mean they won't consider entry level jobs, and 
even if they don't, you might be able to get a reference to 
another company that is interested. Talk to a representative 
from the promoting company; he or she will be a good source 
of information about what companies are looking for nowa
days.
Job fairs can be a valuable source of information and 
contacts if you know how to approach them successfully.

GRADUATE SCHOOL
6
Grad school may be the 
answer for you
For some people, joining the work force is the correct path 
to choose after graduating college. However, if you have a clear 
sense of what career you want to pursue, and if an advanced 
degree is required for entry into that field, then graduate school 
is for you. Below are seven steps the Career Center recom
mends that you take if you are interested in attending graduate 
school.
1. Define your career goals and the area in which you 
would like to specialize. If you are interested in law, medicine, 
college or university teaching, or just want to learn more in a 
particular academic discipline, then graduate school is for you. 
Try to narrow down the field you want to study. Check out the 
Career Center Resource Library, Alumni Relations Office, 
faculty or academic advisors, and Hunt Library.
2. Attend the graduate/professional school programs 
sponsored by various colleges and departments. These pro
grams will give you a better idea of what universities around 
the country offer. CMU has three events which you should 
attend: the Graduate Admissions Workshop, the Scholarship 
and Fellowship Meeting, and the Graduate School Conference.
3. Identify schools to which you may apply. You should 
begin to explore schools offering the type of program you are 
interested in starting in your junior year. Directories of gradu
ate study, which can be found in Hunt Library, briefly outline 
each field of study offered by the school, the academic pro
grams, financial aid resources, and application information, as 
well as other information. Some excellent resources are 
Peterson's Guide to Graduate Study (Books 1 to 5), Accounting to 
Zoology, Gourman Report: Graduate and Professional Programs, 
Applying to Graduate Schools in the U.S., and the College Catalog 
Collection Index. All can be found in the Hunt Library.
4. Learn test requirements and test dates. For graduate 
school you may need to take the Graduate Management Ad
missions Test (GMAT), the Miller Analogies Test (MAT), the 
Law School Admissions Test (LSAT), the Graduate Record Ex
amination (GRE), and the Medical College Admissions Test 
(MCAT), to name a few. The graduate school catalogs will 
specify exactly which test you will need to take and usually, the 
score needed to be considered for the program. Almost all 
graduate schools require that you take the GRE. Additional in
formation is available in the Career Center.
5. Acquire information and narrow down choices. Write to 
the schools to which you are considering applying and request 
additional program information, an application packet, finan
cial aid, scholarship, fellowship, and assistantship information. 
In addition, consult with faculty members on the reputation of 
the programs you are considering.
6. Apply to assistantships, fellowships, scholarships and 
financial aid programs early. All your applications  to both 
individual schools and national programs  should be in by 
the end of January of your senior year at the latest. Additional 
information can be found in Grants for Graduate Students and 
Corporate Tuition Aid.
7. Apply to a range of schools with varying academic 
admissions standards. Start on applications as early as possible. 
Your completed packet should contain an application form, an 
application fee, several letters of reference, essays/statement of 
purpose or bibliographies, and test scores. Application dates 
run from November to March.
Applying to graduate school is exhausting. You should 
start steps one through four in junior year and steps five 
through seven in senior year.

The SUPA/GSIA connection
You may be wondering what the acronyms GSIA and SUPA stand for.
GSIA stands for the Graduate School of Industrial Administration, CMU's renowned 
graduate business school. GSIA offers an M.S. in Industrial Administration and Ph.D.s in 
other aspects of business such as accounting, marketing, and finance. Also, GSIA offers an 
undergraduate degree, a B.S. in Industrial Management in one of 3 tracks: H&SS, CIT, and 
Graphic Communications Management. The GSIA building is located across from the gym 
on Tech Avenue. The dean of GSIA is Elizabeth E. Bailey, who has been at CMU since 1983. 
She has a Ph.D. from Princeton, and teaches classes in SUPA. GSIA students learn in depth 
about economics, management, finance, marketing, and other topics. They also learn to 
apply their classroom knowledge to real world problems and decisions.
SUPA, the School of Urban and Public Affairs, was established to train future public 
policy makers and managers whose decisions will affect whole communities. SUPA is a 
graduate school that prepares students for careers in city management. Alfred Blumstein is 
the dean of SUPA and has been at CMU since 1969. He is also the director of the Urban 
Systems Institute, and graduated from Cornell with a Ph.D. SUPA students learn about 
public policies in a political setting, management of changes in organizations, communica
tion skills, cooperative work, the use of computer technology to analyze problems, and 
identification of issues and problems in various fields.
To find out more, call the admissions offices of GSIA or SUPA.

INTERNSHIPS

Internships: a step into the real world
Are you an English major? Do you know what you want to 
do after you graduate? If you don't, join the many students 
who feel the same way. What possible jobs can I get? Who 
should I contact? Am I qualified? These are the questions that 
seem to be running through every student's mind. However, 
for an English major, the options seem vague, especially in a 
technical setting such as CMU. Unlike engineers and other 
technical majors, English majors must search for career infor
mation and opportunities instead of having that come to them. 
So what should an English major know and what should he or 
she do to learn more about the various possibilities?
Pete Jones, associate head of the English Department, gave 
a special presentation last Wednesday about the English 
curriculum and what it entails. He explained that creative fields 
such as advertising, publishing, and the media don't make 
multiple hires in a given year like technical corporations do. 
This lack of demand for creative positions accounts for the 
reason that fewer of these careers are presented during job fairs 
on campus or located in the resource library of the Career 
Center.
Jones continued to inform students that there are job 
postings on the English Department's bulletin board located in 
the hallway of the second floor of Baker Hall for those who are 
interested. Also, if any English major is considering an internConsider alumni interviews
The Alumni Networking Program works to bring to
gether students and alumni. This program refers students 
to alumni working in the fields, companies, or industries 
into which the student wishes to gain insight or informa
tion.
For more information, contact the Alumni Relations 
Office at 5017 Forbes, x2060.
ship (which is highly recommended) or would like to discuss 
career opportunities or graduate programs, the English Depart
ment can help answer your questions and give valuable advice 
and information.
An interesting point made during Jones' informal presenta
tion was that when an English major goes into an interview and 
the interviewer asks, "So, what is professional writing?" the 
student should define his or her major according to the job 
situation and desired position.
At Blattner/Brunner Inc., an advertising agency located in 
downtown Pittsburgh, Katie Bicknell, marketing director, 
comments "there's a trend in hiring those with a general solid 
background." Having studied journalism in college, Bicknell 
encourages English students to make the effort to find out what 
area of interest will best suit him or her. She advises setting up 
a 15 to 30 minute interview with different career areas such as 
public relations, media, and editing to quickly get a sense of 
what the position involves. However, to really understand a 
particular job position, she recommends that there is no real 
substitution for internships and summer jobs.
Currently, I have an internship with the Marketing Depart
ment at Blattner/Brunner, Inc. The agency is the eighth largest 
one in Pittsburgh and it's large enough to see all the depart
ments working together towards a goal and small enough to be 
given more "on hands" experience. As a senior professional 
writing major interested in getting into advertising, I find this 
experience extremely valuable. The CMU English Department 
has many connections with various agencies and businesses in 
Pittsburgh and will help any student get an internship.
However, if I had known how easy it wouldhave been to 
have the English Department do this for me, I wouldn't have 
gone through the tedious process of researching all those 
agencies in Pittsburgh and mailing out resumes and letters. Yet 
in a way, going through this process helped me become aware 
of other possibilities, learn more about what I wanted and ex
perience the equivalent feeling of "looking for a job."
What do I do? I work on a wide range of projects. I have 
written radio copy, proofread articles, researched, wrote copy 
for ads, designed brochures, and contributed creative ideas for 
various projects. One of the exciting aspects of my internship is 
that I can watch a final advertising shoot, radio demo, or a 
commercial shoot for a project that I have been working on. 
Currently I am working on a promotional campaign for Ember 
Farms which involves writing a marketing plan and deciding 
on what sort of direct mail would be most influential. These 
projects are challenging, yet I'm also responsible for some of 
the "dirty work." This includes filing occasionally, organizing 
tapes, and grouping media clips, but I don't mind because I'm 
also getting the experience I want.
Don't stress out about the future. If you communicate with 
the right people and keep in touch with your department, you 
can make the right moves to build your future.

INTERVIEWS
10
The ABCs of interviewing
For many people, going through the interview process is a 
nerve-wracking experience. You spend days deciding what to 
wear, worrying about your competition, and preparing all the 
documents you need, such as recommendations and samples of 
your work. By the time the day of the interview you've already 
convinced yourself that you have no chance of getting the job. 
The more you know about how the interview process works, 
however, the more confident you will feel.
Before the Interview
In order to sign up for on-campus interviews, you must be 
registered with the Career Center. Check out the postings on 
the bulletin board across from the Escort desk in the basement 
of Skibo, on the bulletin boards outside the Career Center and 
in your academic department to see which employers are com
ing to campus. Notices are posted every Monday and Thurs
day; sign-ups begin the following morning at 7:30 am. Sched
uled interviews can only be canceled at least 24 hours in 
advance and in person so that a student on the wait list can be 
contacted.
Before the interview, learn about the company. Consult the 
Interview Specification binders in the Career Resource Library, 
promotional literature and annual reports. Talk to past or pres
ent employees. Find out about the size of the organization, the 
location of facilities, the structure, past, current, and potential 
growth, product line, industry, service, clients, stock history, 
competition, training, and trends.
Arrive on time or early for the interview. Bring a transcript, 
samples of your work, and an updated resume. Memorize the 
name of the person who will interview you. Dress appropri
ately  stick with solid, muted colors.
During the Interview
Start off the interview with a firm handshake and a smile. 
Make eye contact. During the interview, ask relevant questions 
about the company's job opportunities, etc. Be aware of your 
body language. Try to relax  be honest and open.
Remember that the interviewer cannot ask certain ques
tions. Here are some guidelines:
Inquiry about national origin or ancestry is limited to the 
languages the applicant can fluently speak or write.
Candidates can only be questioned about having disabili
ties which would prevent them from meeting the requirements 
of the job.
Inquiries involving marital status are permissible if 
related to the candidate's ability to relocate or undertake 
business travel if necessary.
After the Interview
After the interview, send the interviewer a brief note thank
ing him or her and repeating your interest in the job.
If you want to sharpen your interviewing skills, there is an 
"Interview Skills" workshop on Thursday in Skibo 12 from 4:30 
to 5:30 pm.
If you're not quite ready for a job interview yet, the Alumni 
Networking Program offers students the opportunity to speak 
to professionals to learn more about a company, field, or career. 
This more informal, preliminary method is an information 
interview  not a job interview. You should prepare by re
searching the area or company of interest and forming specific 
questions. Call Alumni Relations at x2060 for more information. 
You can set up your own information interviews by talking to 
professional people you know. This type of interview is also a 
good way to establish contacts and to gain valuable insight.

WOMEN
7
Women in the contemporary job market
In spite of affirmative action, a woman competing in the 
contemporary job market still faces many of the stumbling 
blocks that have plagued generations of working women before 
her. A degree from a prestigious university is not always a 
ticket to a satisfying career. Women cannot afford to be compla
cent, especially in traditionally male-dominated fields. While 
stereotypical attitudes toward women in the workplace are 
decreasing, there is still much room for improvement.
The statistics on women and careers look bleak. Women 
still earn only 70 cents for every dollar earned by a man in the 
same position, although women graduating from college today 
may earn as much as 80 cents. The figure is especially discour
aging because it only rises about one cent a year. At this rate, 
women won't earn as much as men until the year 2019. In 
addition, women (as is the case with other minorities), do not 
have many of their own role models to look up to in such 
traditionally male-dominated areas as science and mathemat
ics. Also, once in a job, women often find that the men who 
were hired at the same time they were are advancing while 
they themselves reach a "glass ceiling" and stop.
The news isn't all bad. The percentage of women graduat
ing from business, medical, and law schools is on the rise, al
though the number of women engineers is declining. The baby 
boomers, who have now reached middle age, are putting 
pressure on business and government to have flexible hours, 
child care facilities, part-time work and personal leave time. 
Hopefully, these will be implemented by the time today's 
college students reach their age. Traditional attitudes toward 
marriage and children are changing. It is predicted that the 
emphasis on marriage will be as an equal partnership, that 
women will be having less children, and that families with one 
or no children will become more and more prevalent. This 
means that women won't have to play "superwoman" any
more, balancing the dual career of workplace and home.
Because barriers to promotion and progression  espe
cially in fields where males are traditionally dominant  rather 
than high expectations are presented to women, it is easy for 
women to become discouraged. However, there is hope for 
those willing to plan their careers and lives and then be flexible 
enough to revamp that plan, perhaps many times.
The areas of the United States which are the best for jobseeking are undoubtedly where recent population and urban 
growth has been the highest, in the south and west. Although 
the oil industry has been declining since the early 80's, many 
industries are moving to these areas, including the fields of 
communications, health care, construction, and leisure.
The news on marriage is good for women. We are currently 
in a period where there is a surplus of eligible men and a 
decline in the number of eligible women. The marriage rate is 
rising; however, most women are following the trend which 
has been prevalent for the past few decades and are deciding to 
marry later and later. For many women, the marriage cere
mony will simply make an already existing living situation 
official. Nearly half of today's couples lived together before 
their marriage. And although men's attitudes toward house
hold tasks are still "traditional," it is predicted that as women 
demand equal pay and treatment on the job, they will demand
demand and receive the same at home.
Another trend for women and men in the labor force will 
be an increasing ability to work at home. Flexible hours as well 
as flexible workplaces will become more and more recognized, 
and women will not have to choose between career advance
ment (or in many cases, career keeping) or child rearing. 
Another way that women do this is through entrepreneurship. 
Many women are starting their own companies and buying 
franchise outlets.
A woman with a degree will have little difficulty finding a 
first job. However, continued advancement may often depend 
on a return to school, especially considering how rapidly 
changes in technology occur. And a woman competing for a 
job or a market may not be vying with the man in the next 
office but rather with overseas competition from Japan or 
Germany, or any of the developing countries along the Pacific 
Rim.
Career opportunities for women read something like a 
good news/bad news joke. The opportunities for women to 
enter any job field are on the rise, as is the revamping of social 
attitudes concerning women and work. However, these 
changes are excruciatingly slow in coming, and long-standing 
traditional attitudes are discouraging and hard to overcome. 
Competitive, hardworking, creative women are needed to 
create strong leadership for the women who will succeed them.

Examining attitudes
An article in Spring 1989 Public Opinion Quarterly 
entitled "Women's and Men's Attitudes About a Woman's 
Place and Roll" provides some interesting data. Authors 
Rita J. Simon and Jean M. Landis felt that there was a slight 
increase in optimism about the status of working women.
The polls, however, produced some surprising results.
For example, a Gallup poll asked "Do you feel that 
women in this country have equal job opportunities with 
men or not?" In 1975,46 percent of men and 49 percent of 
women polled said Yes; in 1987,48 percent of men and only 
35 percent of women said Yes.
Gallup asked, "If a woman has the same ability as a 
man, does she have as good a chance to become the execu
tive of a company or not?" In 1970,39 percent of men and 
39 percent of women said Yes; In 1987,50 percent of men 
and 46 percent of women said yes.
Gallup asked, "If you were taking a new job and had 
your choice of a boss, would you prefer to work for a man 
or for a woman?" In 1975, for women, 60 percent preferred 
a man, 10 percent preferred a woman, and 27 percent said 
it made no difference; for men, the respective figures are 63,
4, and 32 percent. In 1987, for women, 37 percent preferred 
a man, 19 percent preferred a woman, and 39 percent said 
it made no difference; for men, the respective figures were 
29,9, and 57 percent.
