Relations 
Conference 
planned
By PRISCILLA HSUE
Tartan Staffwriter
On October 29-30, a Human 
Relations Conference will be held 
at CMU. The purpose of the twoday workshop will be to increase 
the awareness of students con
cerning racial and ethnic issues.
The workshop will discuss prob
lems on campus such as minority 
stereotypes, homophobia, and the 
male/female ratio.
Dr. Woodrow M. Parker and 
Dr. James Archer, both from the 
University of Florida, are in 
charge of the event. Parker and 
Archer have held similar pro
grams at other schools, all of which 
have been highly successful.
According to Lois Cox, Associ
ate Dean of Student Affairs, Car
negie Mellon President Cyert has 
long been interested in having 
such a workshop. In fact; Cyert 
himself is responsible for funding 
the costly program.
Cox stressed that the confer
ence was not just addressed to 
minorities, but also to those hav
ing different cultures, religions, 
and sexual preferences. Cox felt 
that serious prejudice was not a 
problem at Carnegie Mellon and 
that students display a lack of 
knowledge and awareness rather 
than true animosity.
The workshop represents only 
the beginning of a long term plan

Construction, divestment and teaching 
were prominent issues in the State of the 
University speech delivered by President 
Richard Cyert in the Skibo ballroom last 
Thursday.
Opting not to use the podium on the 
stage, Cyert spoke informally, occasion
ally referring to his notes. He began his 
speech with an update on the construction 
on campus and a compliment to student 
tolerance of the inconvenience associated 
with the construction.
Cyert stated that the new dorm being 
built on the East side of campus is two 
weeks behind schedule.
The commitment, however, is that that 
dorm will be ready for the start of classes 
in 1989....There is a lot of pressure on the 
architects and the builders to make up 
those two weeks and to really live with the 
schedule, so that we may have the dorm 
when we will need it in "-he fall of 1989,
stated Cyert.
The athletic fields will not be ready until 
the middle of the fall semester in 1989. 
Cyert expressed sympathy for students 
being denied access to the Cut: Unless 
youre a football player youve had the Cut 
taken away from you. The Cut has always 
been an important part of our activities, 
but everyone seems to have been a good 
sport about it and adjusted and I really 
thank you for that.
With regard to the new student center, 
Cyert said that he is having the architects 
take a second look at their plans.
Instead of having one large building, 
Cyert feels that two smaller buildings that 
could be connected would be more advan
tageous. With two smaller buildings, con
struction could begin sooner because it 
takes less money to begin the construction. 
Rather than raising the $30 million neces
sary to begin construction, CMU could raise 
half that amount and begin construction 
sooner.

Son of former VP leads Democratic rally
By KARL BARNHART
Tartan Editor-in-Chief
Its going to take a good swift 
kick in the ass to keep Vice Presi
dent George Bush on the cam
paign issues, but the Democratic 
ticket will prevail on Nov. 6, ac
cording to the Son of the Former 
Next President Ted Mondale.
Mondale, Midwest Director of 
the Dukakis/Bentsen campaign 
and son of former Vice President 
Walter Mondale, was on campus 
last Monday to lead a Democratic 
rally sponsored by the College
Democrats.
Saying there were only 50 days 
before the most important elec
tion of our generation, Mondale 
urged the 40 students in the 
Wherrett Room to help spread 
the Dukakis solution.
Lets not look back in five years 
or 25 years and say we didnt act. 
Our time is now and our time is 
limited...we need common sense 
in the White House, said Mon
dale.
Dukakiss common sense solu
tion to education is his Student 
Tuition and Repayment System
(STARS). This is a program that 
would allow everyone to go to the 
college of his or her choice, said 
Mondale.
STARS is a four-part plan. First, 
Dukakis proposes to make Feder
ally guaranteed student loans 
available from the private sector 
at an interest rate which is lower 
than the commercial rate. These 
loans, available to all students 
regardless of their financial need, 
will help those students who are 
currently being squeezed out of 
the Guaranteed Student Loan 
program by Reagan-administration cuts.
Next, Dukakis would increase 
the Pell and Perkins grant pro
grams, thereby reducing the 
amount of debt accrued by stu
dents on financial aid.
Third, those students willing 
to commit five years to teaching 
on the elementary or secondary 
level would be eligible for in
creased grants under Dukakiss 
Teachers Excellent Program.
And last, to attract better stu
dents into teaching, the Demo
cratic ticket promises to increase

Senior protests lack of student parking
By CARLOS FRANCO
Tartan News Editor
Last Wednesday, Senior Drama 
Major Nick Santoro locked him
self in his car, which was about to 
be towed out of the Skibo visitor 
parking lot, and refused to get 
out.
Santoro spent about twenty 
minutes in his car while Campus 
Police tried to extract him. Ac
cording to Sergeant Bill Ricci, 
Campus Police arrived at the 
scene and then called Student 
Affairs to have someone come over 
and assist them.
Assistant Dean of Student Af
fairs Lois Cox arrived at the scene, 
and she spoke with Santoro, who 
stated that he did not want to 
have his car towed. Since Santoro 
did not have the money to pay for 
the towing charge Cox then ar
ranged for an emergency loan for 
Santoro to cover his towing 
charges.
After arrangements were made
to pay the towing charge, 
Santoros car was lowered off the 
flatbed tow truck.
From his car, Santoro stated 
concern over what he considered 
unfair treatment by the Univer
sity, and exclaimed, They gave 
me a ticket, and then they tow my 
car.
Santoro, who lives off campus 
in order to save money, had to pay 
over five hundred dollars in park
ing fines last year. Santoros 
passive resistance on Wednesday 
cost him $95, a $55 towing charge, 
a $20 parking citation, and a $20 
internal disorderly conduct cita
tion.
Despite his reaction to the 
towing of his car, Santoro stated 
that he feels the administration 
is making progress in its effort to 
accommodate students. In de
scribing the situation Santoro 
stated, It brought back a lot of 
faith in the administration when 
Dean Cox came over and worked

Congress passes 
Canadian trade
legislation
.1 WASHINGTON (DJ)  The 
Senate gave final congressional 
.approval last Tuesday to a meas
ure that would phase out tariffs 
'between the U.S. and Canada, 
creating the worlds largest open 
market.
Although President Reagan is 
expected to sign the bill, which 
-passed on an 83-9 vote, it wont 
take effect until the Canadian 
Parliament agrees to comparable 
legislation. The issue has deeply 
divided Canadians, and the ma
jor opposition parties there have 
blocked action in the Canadian 
Senate.
. The U.S. legislation, which the 
House passed 366-40 last month, 
would make U.S. laws and regu
lations conform to the free-trade 
agreement signed Jan. 2 by Re
agan and Canadian Prime Minis
ter Brian Mulroney. The pact 
would eliminate all tariffs be
tween the worlds largest trading 
partners over 10 years beginning 
next Jan. 1.
' Sen. Daniel Moynihan (D-NY) 
called the agreement a boost for 
the world trading system. Sen
ate Finance Committee Chairman 
Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.) said the 
bilateral pact could strengthen 
the U.S. hand in next years talks 
on the multilateral General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
 We can say...If you wont work 
with us to open world trade, then 
we can negotiate trade agree
ments with other countries on a 
bilateral basis,  Sen. Bentsen 
said.
What Senate opposition there 
Was centered on lawmakers 
home-state considerations. Sen. 
Kent Conrad (D-ND), for instance, 
complained that wheat and live
stock farmers in North Dakota 
would be hurt, and Sen. Carl Levin 
(D-Mich.) voiced concerns about 
the pacts effect on U.S. auto 
makers. We lose more than we 
gain, Levin said.
Canadian duties on U.S. goods 
now average 9 percent of a 
products value, and U.S. tariffs 
on Canadian imports average 4 
percent.
In Canada, Liberal Party lead
ers complain that Canada will be 
swamped by U.S. goods and serv
ices if trade barriers are removed. 
Although polls show that a ma
jority of Canadians support freer
trade with the U.S., opinion is 
divided on the merits of the freetrade agreement.
NATIONAL NEWSa
Bush implicated 
in oil scandal
NEW YORK (D J)A report in 
Barrons suggests possible impro
prieties on the part of Vice Presi
dent George Bush in connection 
with a Mexican oil drilling opera
tion.
Without breathing a word to 
shareholders in his Houston oildrilling company, Zapata OffShore Co., Bush in 1960 helped 
set up another drilling operation 
employing Mexican front men and 
seemingly circumventing Mexi
can law. He did so in association 
with Jorge Diaz Serrano, a newly 
convicted felon who has become a 
symbol of political corruption.
In helping to launch Perfora
ciones Marinas del Golfo  bet
ter known as Permargo  Bush 
and his associates at Zapata 
teamed up with Diaz Serrano and 
a Mexican associate in camou
flaging the 50% American owner
ship of Permargo.
Mexican law gives advantages 
to companies based on their 
Mexican ownership.
Eventually, Diaz Serrano took 
control of Permargo, before mov
ing bn the head Pemex, Mexicos 
government oil monopoly. Shortly 
after his five-year stint at Pemex, 
he began a five-year stint in jail, 
having defrauded the Mexican 
government of $58 million it is 
still trying to get back.
Efforts to pinpoint the precise 
nature of Bushs involvement in 
Permargo have been severely 
hampered by the fact that a fed
eral warehouse inadvertently 
destroyed a host of 20-year-old 
pertinent Zapata SEC filings early 
in the first term of the Reagan 
Administration. Specifically miss
ing are all the files from 1960- 
1966, the years spanning Bushs 
involvement with Permargo. 
There is no way of knowing 
whether these records contained 
material beyond those available 
from the company itself.
At the time of the Permargo 
deal, Bush was Zapatas presi
dent and chief executive and he 
and his family and their privately 
held companies were by far 
Zapatas largest shareholders. 
Despite the perplexing fate of the 
documents, a clearer picture of 
Bushs involvement in the shad
owy Mexican operation has
emerged from official records in 
Mexico City and interviews with 
Bushs associates in the deal. To 
hear them tell it, Permargo was 
cooked up because of new Mexi
can government strictures requir
ing that drilling contracts to be 
put in the hands of Mexican na
tionals.
These associates indicate that 
about half the stock in Permargo 
was held by Americans intimately 
connected to Bush, including 
longtime employees and a large 
Zapata shareholder. These offi
cials thereupon enlisted Mexican 
front men as stand-ins so that 
Permargo would appear on offi
cial records to be 100% Mexican 
owned.
When asked why the American 
participation in the company was 
kept secret, Fernando Cabrera, 
the lawyer who fronted for the 
Americans, would say only that it 
was for practical reasons. Bushs 
press aide said that an American 
firm could not do business directly 
in Mexico without having Mexi
can partners.
Bushs associates also report 
that Permargo directly competed 
with Zapata, thus depriving 
Bushs drilling concern of at least 
some revenues. Judging from of
ficial records Zapata produced 
from those days, Zapatas 2,000 
shareholders apparently were 
never told of Permargos existence 
nor of how its existence might 
effect the Amex-listed company 
whose shares it owned.
Bush declined to respond to 
questions raised in the article, 
saying he hadnt yet read it.
McDonald's wins 
copyright suit
NEW YORK (DJ)  Quality 
Inns International Inc. was 
beaten last Monday in a trade
mark case by McDonalds Corp. 
The commercial lexicon, it ap
pears, has been taking a beating, 
too.
Federal Judge Paul Niemeyer 
in Baltimore enjoined Quality 
Inns from calling each hotel in its 
new low-priced chain a McSleep 
Inn. He ruled that the term in
fringed on the family of trade
marks McDonalds applies not 
only to muffins and chicken nug
gets but to childrens clothing 
(McKids), job programs (McJobs) 
and even a hotel the fast-food 
chain owns near its headquarters 
in Oak Brook, 111. (McLodge).
Stephen Sachs, a McDonalds 
attorney, said the ruling is the 
first concerning the Me prefix to 
find infringement of the 
McDonalds trademarks outside 
the food industry. McDonalds had 
already won a suit to stop a bak
ery from calling itself McBagel.
The case at hand, the judge 
argued, had to turn largely on
whether McSleep would confuse 
the public. Although the hotel 
chain has yet to open, surveys 
during the litigation indicated 
many people would think McSleep 
is a new venture by McDonalds. 
Furthermore, the judge found that 
the coining of McSleep was a 
deliberate attempt to trade on the 
good will and reputation of 
McDonalds.
Quality Inns, a unit of Manor 
Care Inc., argued that by using 
McSleep it only meant to convey 
an image of Scottish-style thrift. 
The last thing we wanted was for 
our lodging product to be con
fused with a hamburger chain, 
said Robert Hazard Jr., president 
and chief executive officer of 
Quality Inns.
But after the judges ruling 
Friday, officials at Quality Inns 
promised to be quick to drop their 
Me and get on with building the 
new chain under a new name, 
Sleep Inn.

Gay rights bill 
being considered 
by City Council
The Pittsburgh City Council is 
considering an amendment to city 
law which would add sexual ori
entation to the list of characteris
tics protected against discrimi
nation.
The bill would protect homo
sexuals from discrimination in ob
taining employment and housing. 
Currently the law protects people 
from such discrimination on the 
basis of sex, religion, race, color, 
national origin, and place of birth.
The bill has evoked a great deal 
of emotional response on both 
sides. One hundred twenty people 
testified Thursday at a City Coun
cil hearing on the bill. Roughly 
three quarters of the people sup
ported the bill and the other quar
ter opposed it.
Many of the people opposing 
the bill claim to be concerned 
about the effect on children of 
being exposed to gays in positions 
such as school teachers. Others 
have objected on religious 
grounds. Complaints by the 
Catholic Church about having to 
hire gays in violation of its anti
gay beliefs have led to considera
tion of an exception to the law for 
religious organizations.

Cyert addresses campus community
Continued from page 1
In addition to having in
creased space for student ac
tivity, Cyert stressed the im
portance of better facilities to 
improve the quality of student 
life. Later, when talking about 
attracting quality students, He 
stressed the importance of im
proved facilities to compete 
with Cornell, M.I.T., and the 
Ivy League.
Cyert also stated that the 
parking garage will be com
pleted by the fall of 1989.
On the subject of divestment, 
Cyert reaffirmed the policy that 
the school has recently adopted 
partial divestment of South Af
rican-related stocks.
Last May the Board of Trus
tees voted 17-14 against total 
divestment. Cyert said that 
prior to that meeting he  wrote 
a strong letter favoring action.
Cyert described the schools 
policy of partial divestment as
consistent with what the trus
tees had voted on in terms of no 
divestment, but at the same time... 
a policy that showed more strongly 
the fact that this university does 
care about what is going on in 
South Africa.
Carnegie Mellon will not divest 
from companies that support the 
University financially, according 
to Cyert. I do not think it is 
honest or right for us to say that 
we wont hold your stock, but we 
will take your money.
Cyert also said that since many 
large firms have already left South 
Africa it is relatively easy to main
tain a South African-free portfo
lio.
According to Cyert, many people 
have misconceptions about SEI. 
There is no classified research 
going on there. In addition he 
stated that the primary objective 
of SEI is to improve the produc
tivity of computer programmers.
The University is looking into
the problem of a lack of a for
eign language department. The 
President mentioned that he 
would be holding office hours 
for students later on in the year.
The 35 minute speech was 
attended by a small group of 
approximately 50 students and 
administrators. It was followed 
by a brief question and answer 
session.
Other topics that Cyert dis
cussed were the Capital Fund, 
relations with City officials, 
alcohol policy, foreign language 
curriculum, human relations, 
faculty shortages in the Eng
lish department and parking.
When Student Body presi
dent Andrew Robitshek intro
duced Cyert, he praised Cyerts 
accomplishments. Under 
President Cyert the University 
has progressed from a small 
Pittsburgh school to a nation
ally known institution, said 
Robitshek.
University considers ways to fix the Fence
By JONATHAN LEVY
Tartan Assistant News Editor
As most students already know, 
one of the Fences bottom cross
bars has been broken since the 
beginning of the academic year.
For the past two weeks, the 
crossbar has been propped up by 
cinder blocks. The cinder blocks 
were put in place by Phi Kappa 
Theta fraternity while they held 
the Fence from September 3 to 
September 17.
Because of the tradition repre
sented by the Fence, the Univer
sity is attempting to obtain as 
much student input as possible 
before making a decision about 
how to fix it. Student Ombuds
man Michael Murphy and Stu
dent Body President Andy Ro
bitshek have scheduled a meet
ing regarding the Fence for 4:30 
pm on October 4.
According to Murphy, The pur
pose of the meeting will be to ex
plore the options. The site of the 
meeting has not been set but 
Murphy said that anyone who is 
interested in attending should call 
him at 268-2991.
Murphy plans to open the meet
ing to anyone who wishes to at
tend unless the number of people 
becomes too large. Those who can 
not attend but wish to contribute 
ideas are invited to call Murphy 
or Robitshek. Robitsheks phone 
number is 268-5495.
Murphy plans to investigate 
various options for one or two 
weeks and then present them to 
the University community for 
feedback. There is no target date 
to have the Fence fixed, but 
Murphy said, There seems to be 
agreement on all corners that 
something needs to be done... by 
the end of October.
University Architect Paul Tell
ers said it is not yet known how 
much of the fence will need to be 
replaced. The crossbar is the only 
part broken at the moment but 
Tellers said he has heard that the 
posts may be in bad shape as 
well.
The Fence was built by the 
Carnegie Tech class of 1923 as a 
meeting place for seniors. Senior 
Vice President Edward Schatz 
said when he arrived on campus 
in 1939 as a freshman it was still 
know as the Senior Fence and 
underclassmen were not allowed 
to sit on it. He says students had 
already begun painting it at that 
time.
Schatz said that the Fence has 
been repaired before in its 65 years 
of existence. In fact, he believes 
that it is possible that no piece of 
the original Senior Fence remains 
in the current Fence.

with prejudice. There are prob

Santoros protest was a result 
of being continually fined. He feels 
that not enough consideration for 
gtudents goes into the present 
parking permit decisions.
At present according to Associ
ate Director of Campus Opera;ions Oscar Mayer, parking pernits are allocated by a program 
hat uses seniority as its major 
riteria.
There are three categories into 
vhich the applicants fall. The first 
category contains senior faculty 
and administration, who receive 
the greatest consideration.
Faculty, administration, and

vhich receives the least amount

is composed of students.Within 
he third category, priority is given
to students based on class stand
ing.
In the process it is possible for 
an undergrad to get a parking 
allocation, ... but its extremely 
unlikely, stated Mayer.
After the permits are allocated, 
a waiting list is formed. This 
waiting list operates on the same 
priority system; however, 
waitlisted students who commute 
receive priority over those who 
live on campus.
The temporary construction lots 
have increased the number of 
parking space from last year by 
about 100 to approximately 1930. 
The expansion of the residential 
parking permit area which the 
city undertook this summer cost 
the University parking spaces.
According to Mayer, overall, 
this permit system is takinglegal 
places out of the system faster 
than we can add them by about a 
factor of four to one.

FOCUS
An open letter to the President
Dear President Cyert:
On behalf of the student body, we would like to apologize for the 
abysmal turnout at your State of the University Address.
It seems, Dr. Cyert, that the student body is extremely good at 
whining, but it doesnt really care what you have to say.
The facilities arent good enough, the teachings not good enough, 
the classrooms arent large enough, and the majors arent broad 
enough.
Just fix it, says the student body, I dont care how; I dont care 
when just as long as you make the changes tomorrow. I dont 
want to be inconvenienced any more.
And yet you took this. You stood in the Ballroom, on the floor, 
without a microphone, and explained to 40 some students and a 
room full of chairs what you are doing to improve the facilities, 
improve the teaching, improve the classrooms and improve the 
majors.
You didnt pull any punches. You took questions until we had 
nothing more to ask and answered all the questions that were 
asked.
Of course, wed like to think that maybe the reason the atten
dance was so poor was the timing. Most students have classes at 
3:30 pm and were unable to attend. We understand how tight your 
schedule is, but wasnt there a way to do this at a more convenient 
time? Maybe during university free time?
Whatever the reason, we cant let this be the last State of the 
University Address. It takes more than just whining on one side 
and unheard speeches on the other to make a change; it takes an 
open dialog for a successful studentyadministration relationship.
A lot of people who believe in a channel of communication be
tween Warner Halls sixth floor and students went to bat for this 
speech, including the Student Body President, yet the student 
body let you down.
Dr. Cyert, the student body let us down, too.

Free our free time
Q: When is free time not free?
A: When its at 4:30 pm.
Last year, the implementation 
of Monday through Friday 4:30 
pm to 6:30 pm as University-wide 
Free Time was hailed as one of the 
steps towards improved Quality 
of Life. Would someone please 
forward the memo to Deans Midani and Bailey.
Currently, both CFA and GSIA 
schedule classes during free-time. 
Officials at both colleges may 
argue that they exert a greater 
amount of control over their stu
dents lives, and GSIA admini
stration may point out that the 
edict only applies to undergradu
ate classes, but both schools are 
still members of the University 
community.
Shouldnt a University-wide 
policy apply to all, regardless of 
each colleges agendas? Otherwise 
the goal of providing a common 
time for club meetings, team prac
tices, and events of Universitywide interest are lost.
Q: When is free time not free?
A: When its at 7:30 am.
Last year, the institution of 7:30

Prejudice against gays exists at CMU
am exams by the mathematics, 
physics, and chemistry depart
ments was rationalized as an at
tempt to preserve the uniformity 
of test taking in core classes.
The above two items seem unre
lated, but they really arent. They 
were both attempts to standard
ize and regulate student life. Both 
have failed. Students have com
plained that they can not perform 
at their best at 7:30 in the morn
ing. Students have missed club 
meetings and sports practices 
when their classes run through 
free time.
The solution is 4:30 pm exams. 
The period from 4:30 pm to 5:30 
pm is already no longer sacred, 
CFA and GSIA have shown that. 
If hour exams are limited to one 
or two days a week and are sched
uled through the Registrars of
fice, teams and clubs should not 
be adversely affected. And if the 
folks in Warner and Scaife Halls 
arent sure about this idea, ask 
Student Senate which is working 
on a 7:30 exam proposal.
Q: When will free time be free?
A: Hopefully soon.
Editor:
I would almost believe that the article 
by Donna Grear [CMU Students lack 
understanding, knowledge, September 
20] about students understanding of gays 
on campus was a political move to create 
complacency on campus, if it werent so 
full of contradictory statements.
As Michael Portuesi clearly states in 
the beginning of the other article, there 
is an important distinction between tol
erance and acceptance. Not only is this 
distinction ignored by Grear, but the 
constant fluctuation in her attempt to 
describe the atmosphere for gays on 
campus only confuses readers and dis
guises the issue further.
She talks about segregation (a word 
that is loaded with prejudice from the 
startif not from its use in history, then 
surely in its implied aversion toward a 
unified and accepting society) of gays and 
straights as being probably not inten
tional and [not] really stem[ing] from 
prejudice, explaining later that homo
sexuality simply makes many hetero
sexuals uncomfortable. I wonder why.
Letters to the Editor
Does that have nothing to do with preju
dice? Nothing to do with acceptance?
Let me put this in different .terms. 
Suppose that I am a vegetarian. I accept 
the fact that others eat meat, and I ac
cept them. I feel comfortable eating with 
meat eaters, though I am not one myself. 
Suppose, then that I am not in favor of 
people eating dogs. Not only do I not eat 
dogs but I think that others shouldnt; I 
think that those who do are in some way 
wrong. I call them names, I stare at 
them, I use dog-eater as a derogatory
term. I tolerate these people insomuch 
that I dont try to kick them off campus, 
or beat them up, but I dont feel comfort
able with them, and I would not want to 
sit with them. I put up with them, but I 
still judge them for what they do (preju
dice). The point is that acceptance means 
being comfortable with something (with
out having to adopt it); likewise, toler
ance means putting up with something, 
but still being prejudiced against it.
Hiding these distinctions, Grear first 
talks about people who flippantly use 
the words fags and queers, and who 
stare blatantly at the gay people at the 
activities booth. Then she makes sur
prising conclusions or generalizations

H&SS Dean defends Mac II plan

umn by Jerry Mereness criticizing the 
H&SS workstation plan. He has made a 
number of faulty assumptions about our 
plan that might have been avoided had
Advice from students welcome
Editor:
Just a comment on grading and the 
quality of teaching at CMU in general. I 
think Michael Drout should always make 
sure he gets his facts correct before edito
rializing. But, I also believe Professor 
Swedlow is wrong to tell him (or any 
other student) to withhold his advice.
Students pay upwards of $10,000 a 
year to come here and be educated by us, 
the faculty. We all know very well if we 
spent $10,000 or more on a car and it 
wasnt running perfectly wed be back at 
the dealers immediately demanding a 
free tune-up. And if the dealer insisted 
we had to be a certified auto mechanic to 
determine whether or not our cars were 
performing correctly, wed be outraged.
Students have a right and responsibil
ity as consumers of a very expensive 
education to offer constructive criticism 
of the University in all its facets. I believe 
my effectiveness as a teacher has in
creased substantially thanks to the con
structive criticism of my students. Its 
time we stopped looking down on the 
undergraduates as manycertainly not 
all  faculty do. Our students are intel
ligent, talented, vibrant people. They de
serve and should expect our best efforts 
in the classroom.
Obviously, it is important to balance 
the competing demands of research and 
teaching. But the key word there is bal
ance. It can be done. We need to take a 
more personal interest in our students 
and their intellectual growth.
By the way, regarding CMlFs grading 
scale: A is excellent, B is good, C is 
satisfactory, D is poor, and R is failure.
I find in the classes I teach that satis
factory is rare and good and excellent are 
common.

he taken the time to check on the facts.
First, our target configuration is a Mac
II with 4MB of memory, an 80MB disk, 
and a 19" B&W monitor. The target price 
of $3,000 is for purchases in January 
1990 and not today. Both configuration 
and price are consistent with the origi
nal 1982 university workstation plan.
Second, the Mac II will be supported as 
an Andrew workstation and the Mach 
operating system is currently being 
converted by Academic Computing to 
run on the Mac II. A beta-test version 
will be operable sometime next spring. 
Thus, H&SS freshmen in 1989-90 should 
be able to use the Mac II with both the 
Mac OS and Andrew.
Third, the H&SS core curriculum has 
had a tradition of innovative use of 
computer-based materials. Award-win

Theres more to the Left than just liberals
Editor:
Jeff Fartros column in The Tartan of 
13 September suggests that you should 
determine your political ideology be
fore you choose the people that you 
should vote for, and then gives a con
venient scale with which to analyze 
your own ideological position and make 
that choice. By happy coincidence, 
Fartros remarks were printed facing 
another column complaining about the 
widespread professorial practice of 
grading exams on a curve, a practice 
that was characterized as based on 
the fallacy that the grades in a class
room should be normally distributed. 
I would suggest that Fartros scale is 
itself an extremely misleading distri
bution curve that imposes a very 
narrow range of normality, into which 
all political positions must fall. This 
kind of scale implicitly makes any 
position that cannot be defined in terms 
of its categories abnormal by defini
tion, and in fact tends to make any 
such position (and any American who 
holds it) invisible. That Fartros scale
does accurately reflect the way political 
positions are perceived and defined in 
the popular ideology of the United States
 even in the minds of its most highlyeducated young men and women  
should be understood as an indication of 
how carefully controlled and exclusive 
this countrys political process actually 
is.
Fartro asserts that the two dominant 
political ideologies today are liberal and 
conservative and defines them as, re
spectively, opposing or supporting 
what he calls traditional American val
ues. He also gives exemplars of these 
liberal (McGovern, Ted Kennedy, Mike 
Dukakis, Dan Rather [!]) and conserva
tive positions (Kemp, Helms, Buckley, 
Robertson, Reagan). I will note only in 
passing that the way Fartro defines tra
ditional American values itself imposes 
a very conservative agenda. One could 
define tolerance for a plurality of life
styles and opinions, protection of indi
vidual rights against arbitrary uses of 
state power (what Fartro seems to mean 
by expansion of criminal rights), re
spect for other nations independence 
and sovereignty, etc., as traditional 
American values and things would 
start to look a little different. But Im 
less interested here in trying to juggle 
or reverse this linear polarity than in 
emphasizing how infinitesimally nar
row it really is.
This is a scale with no left end that 
would be noticeable to me or many 
Americans like me (real, though invis
ible), nor to anyone familiar with the 
way political positions are defined and 
distributed outside the strictly policed 
Disneyland of the American mass 
media (including DanRatherland). 
Despite real disagreements on spe
cific issues, and despite the well-fi
nanced and orchestrated hoopla of 
presidential elections, which is some
what like the insults traded by boxers 
to whip up interest before a match 
from which both will profit, the socalled liberals and conservatives 
of American politics agree on the most 
fundamental political goals and stratecontinued on page 6

philosophic Methods not covering the basics...
H&SS students underfed when it comes to philosophy
The textbook for the freshman 
H&SS core curriculum course 
philosophic Methods and Morals 
contains no chapter on Plato. Or 
Socrates. Or Descartes. Or 
Nietzsche, Kant, Marx, or Goethe. 
There is no discussion of John 
Stuart Mill or Thomas Jefferson. 
There are a lot of math .problems.
In his book Cultural Literacy, 
E.D. Hirsch argues that there is a 
certain body of information that 
educated people should know in 
order to have an understanding 
of their western culture. This 
Cultural Literacy is a shared base 
of knowledge that facilitates 
communication and understand

The safest 
sex of all
I am constantly baffled when 
certain so-called family plan
ning groups proclaim that you 
can have safe sex by simply 
taking precautions. On the con
trary, the only precaution that 
guarantees safety is abstinence.
Jeff Fartro
There is no such thing as com
pletely safe sex outside of mar
riage. Safer sex  maybe. But 
risk-free sex is out of the question.
Sex outside of marriage involves 
at least four distinctive and un
avoidable dangers. Perhaps the 
worst of these is the risk of catch
ing one of the many venereal dis
eases like AIDS.
If you contract AIDS, it will kill 
you. Presently, no cure exists. It 
is difficult to even know if you or 
your partner have AIDS since the 
disease can remain dormant for 
months or even years. There are 
ways of decreasing your chances 
of catching sexually transmitted 
diseases (STDs). But, save absti
nence, there is no 100% effective 
preventative.
As with the STDs, there exists 
no 100% reliable pregnancy pre
ventative. Unwanted pregnancy 
can generate more complex prob
lems than AIDS.
A woman in this situation will 
have to ask herself questions 
about abortion, adoption, and 
single parenting. No simple solu
tion exists.
If the physical risks arent bad 
enough, you must also deal with 
the psychological dangers. Its no 
great secret that mutually grati
fying sex takes practice. Mutu
ally gratifying sex, however, wont 
hold a relationship together. If 
you think it will, look at the 50% 
divorce rate in our country. Plac
ing too much emphasis on the 
physical leads to an unbalanced, 
unhealthy relationship.
Obviously, something else is 
needed. People should strive to 
learn about each other as indi
viduals. See if your interests, 
goals, and philosophies are com-. 
patible. You should work together, 
exercise together, and relax to
gether.
If you can get along without 
sex, you will certainly be able to 
get along later with sex. Why not 
be safe and save sex for marriage?
Sex before marriage devalues 
marriage. When you save sex for 
marriage, you save something 
that you and your spouse can 
uniquely share. You save the best 
wedding present that you could 
possibly give your marriage part
ner. Sex makes marriage special.
Some say The marriage cer
tificate is only a piece of paper. 
We dont need to wait. If the mar
riage certificate is only a piece of 
paper before you get married, it 
will only be a piece of paper after 
you get married. You carry your 
pre-marriage habits into marriage 
with you, be they promiscuous or 
disciplined.
With all of the risks involved  
STDs, pregnancy, psychological 
frustration, and marriage devalu
ation  is it any wonder that 
wore and more people today are 
choosing to keep sex in marriage? 
Its a choice Ive made and one 
that I hope you make too.

the most important step in re

The ideas generated and dis

ing Philosophic Methods and 
Morals do not discuss the politi
cal views of Marx and Mill. They
it on their own, but isnt the point 
of a core curriculum to teach cer
tain fundamental ideas? Logic and 
Computation are interesting and 
useful in their own right, but if 
well-rounded students are the 
desired output of the H&SS core, 
shouldnt they know the basic 
tation, an introductory philoso-' philosophical foundations of our
phy course should give students a 
grounding in philosophy, not 
mathematics and computer sci
ence.
At least an acquaintance, if not 
a working knowledge of the ideas 
of the philosophers listed in the 
first paragraph is necessary for a 
student pursuing an education in 
the humanities. It is an integral 
part of the cultural literacy that 
Hirsch, William Bennett, Alan 
Bloom, and other education gu
rus are continually discussing.
Most H&SS students never take 
a second philosophy course, so 
the core is the one chance that 
they have to be taught this infor
mation. Certainly, they can learn
society?
I implore the professors in the 
philosophy department to rethink 
their choice of course material. 
Dont force your research and 
areas of interest down the 
students throats in an introduc
tory course. If Logic and Compu
tation are that important, teach 
them separately, but dont skip 
the fundamentals of philosophy. 
The knowledge of the major ideas 
in philosophy will help produce 
well-rounded, culturally literate 
students  the type of students 
who should be making up and 
graduating from Carnegie Mel
lon, especially from the college of 
Humanities and Social Sciences.
An overdue letter to Andrew Carnegie
Dear Andrew,
Its been a while since we talked. 
Theyve named this new computer 
system after you and I figured Id 
see how it worked.
President Cyert gave a speech 
today on The State of the Univer
sity. Seems like things are going 
really well. Weve raised $115 
million in two years. I think I 
know how they did it: $12,000 per 
student, 7000 students, for two 
years is $168 million - the other 
$53 million must have gone for 
the renovations of the Tartan 
Grill.
The new dorm is two weeks 
behind schedule. Seems there was 
a little problem with City Council 
in getting building permits. Too 
bad we couldnt just hire Pinker
tons to take care of them like in 
the old days.
With all of the construction, the 
football, soccer, and field hockey 
games are all off-campus. Can 
you believe theyve already tried 
giving out T-shirts and kazoos to 
entice people to the games? I dont

know, maybe they should try 
something more appropriate for 
campus, like diskettes...nah, 
theyd never do something as silly 
as that.
Theyre also thinking of reviv
ing the Languages Department. 
However, the administration is 
looking for a new approach to

An old mans gift 
to college students
Few statesmen are left in this 
country. We live in an era in 
which politicians must be multi
millionaires, image conscious 
and cable-ready.
One of the last links to the old 
generation of politicians is West 
Virginias former Senator Jen
nings Randolph. He was first 
elected to Congress in 1932 and
Eric W. Leuiiette
There are lots of worn out rea
sons why everyone should vote, 
but most arent very convinc
ing. This year Im making sure 
I vote because I know the man 
participated in the creation of responsible for the amendment 
New Deal legislation. which gives me that right.
Its no coincidence that his Senator Randolph believed
legislative career continued to 
be progressive. He supported 
ideas which were sound, rather 
than bills which would help re
elect him.
The interstate highway sys
tem is perhaps the idea which 
most changed America. In 1984 
Congress even enacted one of 
Randophs ideas for his retire
ment gift: the Peace Institute.
One piece of legislation that 
Randolph spent decades trying 
to get passed because it was a 
sound idea is particularly im
portant to college students. The 
26th Amendment to the U.S. 
Constitution, which Randolph 
introduced into Congress, low
ered the federal voting age from 
21 to 18.
Ive heard Randolph speak 
several times over the last few 
years and Ive talked to him a 
number of times. Nothing is 
more upsetting to him than the 
low voter turnout of our gen
eration.
Normally Randolph is a 
gentle and gregarious man. But 
when he speaks about the apa
thy of young people during elec
tions, he pounds his fist on the 
podium and his resonant voice 
becomes stem and loud.
So this column is a disguised 
plea for Carnegie Mellon stu
dents to vote on November 8.
that we were responsible 
enough to handle the franchis. 
He has had to watch four elec
tions in which young voter turn
out has been dismal. He is also 
distressed that the trend has 
seemed to continue as the gen
eration who benefited from the 
26th Amendment has gotten 
older.
Several people have com
mented to me that they dont 
know if they will vote because 
they are undecided about for 
whom to vote in a particular 
race. Others are reluctant to 
vote because they dont feel 
informed enough to vote.
Showing up to the polling 
booth does not obligate you to 
vote for every office. Like the 
SAT, there are penalties for 
guessing and if youre going to 
fill the boxes in randomly, you 
might as well not have voted.
So vote, but only in races about 
which you have an opinion.. 
Dont vote for a county assessor 
if you dont know who to vote 
for.
But by voting, youll be mak
ing a retired gentleman a happy 
man.

physics major and a Tartan con
tributing editor. He is looking

election.

Divestment not the way to end apartheid
Editor:
I was interested to see that CMU 
has decided to divest itself of all 
stock with links to South Africa. 
Somehow I did not think that di
vestment was an issue anymore 
in the USA. While I approve of a 
strong moral stand against apart
heid, this move indicates a lack of 
knowledge of what is actually 
going on in S. Africa at this time, 
as well as a naivete about the 
effectiveness of divesting. My
experience (as a citizen of S. Af
rica) is that the pull-out of US cor
porations has proved to be a futile 
exercise in encouraging reform. 
S. African buyers tend to get the 
company at a discount price and 
are often less progressive employ
ers than the American bosses. 
While the consciences of US stock
holders may be appeased, the 
black workers tend to be worse off 
due to disinvestment.
There are many progressive

minutes, he came to the conclu
sion that the injured player 
needed an ambulance. The am
bulance arrived about three min
utes later and took the player to 
the emergency room.
This story does have a point. 
That player was on the ground for 
4+10+5+3 minutes. Thats a total 
of 22 minutes, which is a long 
time for someone in a lot of pain. 
There is no excuse for the IM 
director walking over to an in
jured player. He should have been 
running. Also, Security should hot 
have taken ten minutes to re
spond. Granted, they could have 
been on the other side of campus, 
but our campus is not very large. 
If theres an emergency, it cer
tainly shouldnt take Security ten 
minutes to get there, especially 
since their headquarters are in 
Baker Hall. One possible solution 
is having some type of EMT at the 
IM football games. Football is a 
dangerous sport  tackle OR 
touch.
Basically, I think both the IM 
department and Security have 
some things to work out in terms 
of response time to emergency 
situations and coordination be
tween the two departments (i.e. 
having a security guard who 
knows first aid at the IM games). 
Hopefully something like this will 
never happen again. But ifit does,

sake, that his friends simply drive

Example: liberals and con

whether military support for the 
contras (who were first organized 
in the Carter Administration) is 
now the most effective way to 
reverse the Sandinista revolution 
in Nicaragua, but they agree that 
the primary goal of United States 
policy must be to reverse that 
revolution (that is, to put the Nica
raguan capitalist and landlord
classes back in politi- ___________
cal control of the 
country), and they 
agree that it is useful 
for these purposes to 
characterize this 
revolution as Com

programs. This existing software 
explains why we need a machine 
With the power of a Mac II. Then 
the answer to Mr. Merenesss 
question of why H&SS and not 
CIT is quite obvious. H&SS has a 
clear education program that uses 
computing in an integrated fash
ion. Where better for the univer
sity to begin delivering on its longoverdue promise of educational 
i nnovation using networked work
stations? We believe that our 
students are ready.
Fourth, while the Department 
of Computer Science has unpar
alleled computer research re
sources, few of these have been 
devoted to the development of 
Pascal Genie. Several H&SS de
partments are in the vanguard of 
research computing in their dis
ciplines and one of the objectives 
of our project is to integrate the 
extensive research computing ac
tivities of the college with our 
educational computing activities. 
For example, we are planning to
link the VMS systems in Psychol
ogy and Statistics with our Mac II 
local area network, and we are 
choosing, wherever possible, soft
ware for educational purposes 
that is compatible with software 
already used by faculty on other 
systems.
Fifth, our current development 
program involves projects in ev
ery part of the college from Statis
tics to Modern Languages, and is 
using media such as HyperCard 
and cT, that facilitate the rapid 
development of educational soft
ware. In addition, we are working 
with academic software developed 
elsewhere so that at least some 
new programs will be available 
for use in 1988-89. We are well 
aware of the extensive develop
ment efforts required for quality 
software and we know that every
thing will not be ready next fall.
Sixth, through the leadership 
of Academic Computing, the 
University is acquiring site li
censes for an extensive basic set 
of Macintosh software which CMU 
students may purchase for little 
more than the cost of duplication 
of the documentation. We believe
Wliltr.tcwt rosr-piirA-tc*
(Herblock is on vacation)
that this will discourage rather 
than encourage software piracy. 
Moreover, we have been working 
with Academic Computing to 
ensure adequate repair facilities 
and expanded printing support, 
as well as with the Vice President 
for Enrollment on alternative 
financial aid plans to enable all 
students to purchase a machine if 
they wish. Students may, of 
course, opt to use a roommates 
machine or those in the public 
clusters.
I appreciate Mr. Merenesss 
concern about space in the dorms, 
but this is an issue that is not 
unique to the H&SS plan. The 
space required for a Mac II is not 
much different from that for an 
IBM PC and is virtually identical 
to that of the Andrew machines 
for which we have been planning 
for over six years. Yes, there are 
still details that we, the univer
sity administration, need to work 
out. Yes, there is a concern about 
security and other related mat
ters. But none of these or other 
potential problems suggest to us 
that we have made serious errors 
in our planning to date. H&SS is 
committed to providing its stu
dents with a quality education, 
one which emphasizes working 
with students both inside and 
outside the classroom. Our goal is 
to enhance the education envi
ronment for all CMU students 
and we believe that encouraging 
H&SS students to purchase Mac 
IIs, beginning next year, will 
contribute to that goal.

both the Carter and Reagan ad
ministrations asserted their right 
to continue these activities at the 
executives own discretion, and 
where a sitting Attorney General 
was held in contempt of court for 
the first and only time in Ameri
can history (Griffin Bell of the 
liberal Carter Administration).
But youve probably never heard 
of this case, since it was a bi-par
tisan project, and therefore in
visible to the liberal-conservative 
mass media. Although this case 
was much more constitutionally 
provocative, it just wasnt as in

This is not a mistake! It 
does not mean that the 
political system isnt 
working, but rather that 
it is working quite well in

Nope, neither liberals nor con
servatives want such discussions 
to become a part of American 
public life, and their political 
agenda is designed precisely to 
keep them out. Instead we get 
scintillating defenses of the Pledge 
of Allegiance, and uplifting nar
ratives of ethnic heritage. Our po
of people like Mike Dukakis or 
Dan Rather as representing the 
left end of the political spectrum 
is ludicrous. For anyone who is 
concerned that citizens of historys 
most powerful nation should have 
some realistic sense of the world 
they can so easily damage, it is 
sad. It marks the ability of the 
most reactionary sectors to con
trol the countrys ideological dis
course, keeping it within strictly 
defined limits that are extend
able far to the right, but hardly an 
inch to the left. Only within one of 
the worlds most reactionary political discourses, could someone 
who supports the most dangerous 
first-strike weaponry (like the 
Trident D5), the most arrogant 
American aggression (like the in
vasion of Grenada, a forgotten 
non-issue, invisible behind the bi
partisan enthusiasm), and the vir
tually unlimited arming of dis
credited American puppets (like 
Duarte) be excoriated as advocat
ing unilateral disarmament." 
Only within such a discourse, 
could the word liberal itself be------ come a national insult,
while professions of belief 
in Armageddon, astrology 
and the boomerang ability 
of guided missiles are 
shrugged off as falling 
 within the distribution

So, yes, you should determine

such as the following: The gen
eral attitude towards gays was 
summed up by a junior: Im not 
really sure what I feel about homo
sexuality in general, but I guess 
anyone is entitled to have a club 
that supports their interests,  
and that the attitude towards 
gays doesnt seem to be one of re
sentment, merely one of confu
sion. The use of the words fags 
and queers doesnt sound like 
its coming from the same people 
who arent sure what to think and 
support clubs of any interest. 
Perhaps students dont under
stand homosexuality, but that 
doesnt mean that they think that
they are confused. Rather, it 
sounds that many are satisfied 
with their prejudice  with their 
tolerance  as a form of quasi-liberal politics which is a long way 
from confronting their prejudices 
and accepting the variety of people 
they live with.
The point is not just that gays 
on campus have a less friendlier

GALA could help students handle fear, 
difficulty of accepting homosexuality
Editor:
Allow me to make a few clarifi
cations to the recent articles about 
gays and lesbians at Carnegie 
Mellon.
The article CMU Students lack 
understanding, knowledge, 
[September 20] contains the state
ment: GALA member Michael 
Portuesi estimated that at least 
one hundred to two hundred stu
dents at Carnegie Mellon were 
either homosexual or bisexual, 
and could benefit from GALA. 
While I did say that in my inter
view, and I do stand behind that 
estimate, there is a subtle matter 
of interpretation of that state
ment that did not show through 
in the article.
In the late 1940s, sex researcher 
Alfred Kinsey discovered that gay 
men and women make up at least 
ten percent of the US population.
This fact has been confirmed in 
1970 by an unpublished Kinsey 
Institute study. Assuming that 
the student population is a rea
sonable sample, we come up with 
an estimate of about 600 gays and 
lesbians on campus from an esti
mated student population of about 
6,000. The 100-200 figure I gave 
was my estimate of how many of 
this total population would find 
CMU GALA of some benefit to 
them. We cant be everything to 
everybody, and I can imagine that 
there are gay and lesbian stu
dents on campus that do not wish 
to be part of CMU GALA. But I 
think it is much more the case 
that there are gay and lesbian 
students on campus who are 
afraid to be part of CMU GALA, 
for fear of discovery or fear of 
facing the fact that they are in
deed gay. I should know; I used to
be one of them. Sadly, those are 
the same people for whom CMU 
GALA would have the greatest 
benefit.
Moreso than any other organi
zation on campus, CMU GALA 
has to be a support group and an 
educational service as much as 
we are a social group. Actually, it 
is a shame that we have to per
form these services; the exact 
same societal attitudes that bring 
about fear of homosexuality are 
the attitudes we are trying to fight.
Is it too much to ask that I 
might walk in front of Doherty 
Hall holding hands with my boy
friend and not receive evil stares 
and threats? Heterosexual 
couples on campus do that every 
day.

problem here on campus.
I just finished attending and 
speaking at the City Councils 
meeting on a Gay Rights Bill and 
I constantly heard testimonies 
that argued that the bill shouldnt 
be passed because gays already 
have the rights they are fighting 
for, so lets, in effect, all go home 
and stop worrying about it. If 
that were the case, why did so 
many people show up at the 
meeting (dozens were forced to 
stay in the corridors) to tell the 
council that. What harm could a 
law that reiterated basic gay 
rights (limited only to housing 
and jobs) be to them, if such laws 
already existed in spirit? It sounds 
like the same thing the article is 
supporting: everyone is really 
getting along (in their separated 
worlds) so we dont have to think 
about this issue any more.
Why then are the majority of 
the gay people (generally consid
ered about 10% of a population) 
not feeling free to express them
selves? Why are so many still 
lying to their friends, or avoiding 
the truth, unless they are still

The most patriotic man in Washington
When I came out of the house on 
my way to work the other day, I 
saw my neighbor, Clinton Fogle, 
planting a large American flag on 
his lawn.
Whats the occasion? I 
shouted.
Its Pearl Harbor Day, and I , 
never forget it.
Pearl Harbor Day isnt on the 
7th of September, I said. It 
always takes place during the 
third week of November.
Thats Thanksgiving, he re
minded me.
Of course, it is, and thats why 
it has gone down in history as a

Fogle said, Do you remember 
what you were doing on Sept. 7, 
1941?
I certainly do. I was celebrat
ing the Labor Day weekend. 
Werent you shocked when you 
heard that the Japanese had 
pulled a sneak attack on Hawaii? 
he asked.
I didnt know about it until 
Dec.7. Our radio was on the fritz. 
Fogle continued, Well, I know 
where I was on Sept. 7.1 was at a

games, I told him. I would ven

apathy written all over it. Bush 
keeps flip-flopping on issues such 
as raising the minimum wage, 
the environment and education 
while Dukakis moves to toughen 
his position on defense and for
eign policy. Beyond all the rheto
ric, most home viewers are seeing 
these two candidates to be almost 
identical on all issues. Your apa
thetic soul might as well sit down 
with a beer and watch election 
day from your living room instead 
of participating in the voting 
booth.
That would be a fatal mistake 
for your future and the future of 
our country. If George Bush is 
elected president the clocks will 
be turned back twenty-five years 
in the judicial history of our coun
try. While Bush has slipped to 
the left in recent weeks, he will 
find it difficult to ignore the farright conservative influences 
when he is in the Oval Office. 
While Reagan, thank G_d, had 
little success on his conservative 
social agenda, he was able to stack 
the courts so that we are on the 
verge of throwing ourselves back 
to the times of large-scale segre
gation and back-alley abortions.
It is extremely probable that 
pne or more Supreme Court 
Justice(s) will be appointed dur
ing the next four years. In fact, 
current Justices Brennan, 
Marshall and Blackmun are all in 
their eighties. For this reason the 
next Presidents appointees will 
likely shape the courts opinions 
for many years to come.
It is inconceivable that Bush
Chuck Jainchill
would appoint a liberal to take 
these seats. Bushs election can 
be expected to bring a strong 
majority of conservatives to the 
court. Conservatives who have 
traditionally believed the 
Constitution does not protect 
individual privacy. Conservatives 
who would limit the freedom of 
speech and attack citizens rights 
to fight the government in court. 
Conservatives who would push 
Presidential powers over civil 
liberties. Conservatives who may 
reverse well-established decisions 
on civil rights including a womans 
right to an abortion.
Not so!you might say, George 
Bush is a moderate. Well look 
who is a heartbeat behind Mr. 
Bush. If George Bush chose J. 
Danforth Quayle as his vice-presi
dential candidate for the conser
vative vote, what else might he 
do? It is relatively evident that 
Bush would like to serve more 
than one term and must continue 
to appease these conservative 
elements. Besides, Dan Quayle, 
the new champion of the far-right 
Republicans, would not hesitate 
to influence the courts toward 
these radical reversals.
While George Bush would al
most certainly continue the great 
judicial legacy of Ronald Reagan 
and Ed Meese, Mike Dukakis most 
certainly believes that it is the 
courts place to protect and en
hance liberty and justice in the 
United States. It is our duty as 
responsible citizens to send a clear 
message and make our choice 
known on November 8th.

Grading system a holdover from 
the 60s, says columnist Drout
Editor:
I would like to apologize if my 
column was so offensive that it 
upset Dr. Swedlow enough to 
cause him to stoop to personal 
invective. I did not mean to criti
cize him, simply the logically 
unsound system of grading on a 
bell curve. However, I must point 
?ut a few things:
Dr. Swedlow is correct in say
ing that I had one set of facts 
Scrambled. The student I referred 
to in the column had a 98 (instead 
of the 94 I reported) as his grade 
rage when he received a C, 
and this occurred in the fall of 85 
(I had thought it had happened in 
6). I spoke to the person (an 
plumnus) this past weekend and 
Confirmed these facts.
Dr. Swedlow states that the A 
to F system is relativistic and 
cites the classic explanation (A =
Excellent, etc) to back this up. 
However, he is incorrect. As Ger
trude Stein might have said, an A 
is an A is an A. This letter and the 
absolute numeric (4.0) score asso
ciated with it does not vary from 
class to class as the level of 
achievement required to receive 
it does. This is where the bell 
curve is logically unsound. A stu
dent with an A one year will be 
expected by an outside observer 
to be equal in achievement to a 
student with an A the following 
year. With a relativistic curve, 
this is not necessarily the case.

The other searches desperately meeting so they can be interrofor a way out... it doesnt exist. gated at Senate's every whim.
All of the above are the result of Personally calling a vote for comStudent Senate. From the AB ing bribery is nonsense, 
dance last weekend to the Enthu- The second reason makes more 
siasm committee passing out sense to me. Avoiding double 
horns, from helping Thistle with representation is a much better 
an emergency allocation to help reason than bribery. Allowing 
get the book out faster to recog- double rep can lead to the minornizing clubs (which allows them ity overcoming the majority, 
to reserve rooms and get space in 
Skibo), Student Senate is in al
most everything students do.
In the Senate meeting two 
weeks ago (nothing really excit
ing happened last week) Senator 
Kirk Lenga brought up an amend
ment to the Senate constitution 
to allow certain ex-officio mem
bers to vote again. Their vote was 
taken away last year for two rea
sons. First was that the ex-officio 
members are supposed to be 
coming to Senate to impart spe
cial knowledge to the Senate. The 
idea of giving them a vote was 
considered tantamount to brib
ery. The second reason was that it 
was felt that some constituencies 
were being given double repre
sentation by having the ex-offi
cios vote.
The amendment was brought 
up by Senator Lenga because it 
was his understanding that the 
ex-officios did not represent a 
great enough cross section of the 
student population. However, 
upon further consideration over 
the summer he thought that 
people like the IFC rep repre
sented about a third of the stu
dents. Why, the reasoning follows, 
should a third of the students 
wishes be dismissed?
In any case I think that this is 
something that should be brought 
up in the public forum .Lets tackle 
the problem of bribery. Whats 
wrong with it? The idea of helping 
public servants by slipping them 
a few dollars is almost a require
ment in some countries.
Most of the people reporting to 
Senate have no other function.
Something that happens every 
year at elections because most 
people dont vote.
But if it is controllable, as it is 
in this case, it should be con
trolled. One of the things that 
helps the US to survive is its 
ability to get majority into power, 
but by respecting the minority; 
Something Senate has yet to 
learn.
So what should be 
done? I dont have a 
good answer. Giving 
the ex-officios a vote 
will lead to double rep
resentation. But hav
ing people simply to an
swer any question that 
can come up is selfish 
of the Senate as a 
whole.
Most of these people have work 
to do, just like you. Forcing them 
to come and report when a writ
ten report will do is just a waste of 
the ex-officios time.
The Senate is also wasting time 
arguing over their voting. The 
question is how can we get them 
to work for Senate, without forc
ing the ex-officios to bend to 
Senates whims.

into music that is true to form.
Parkers return to Graffiti 
promises something different. He

confidence game: a swindle ef
fected by gaining the confidence 
of the victim.
confidence man: a swindler who 
; tries to gain the confidence of his 
victim in order to defraud him.
 from Websters New World 
Dictionary 
At one point during our lives we 
all fall for a con game. Its never 
\ intentional (at least not on our 
end of things) and it usually hurts 
i us financially and emotionally.
This is the world into which Di
rector David Mamet thrusts us in 
House of Games. The film starts 
with our introduction to Dr. MarMargaret Ford (Lindsay Crouse), 
.a successful psychiatrist who has
just come out with a new book. 
She leads a very quiet and normal 
life but shows first-hand experi
ence with the subject of her book 
on obsession. Shes a real worka
holic.
One of her patients is a compul
sive gambler who has just lost a 
lot of money. During their ses
sion, he pulls out a gun and threat
ens to kill himself in order to 
avoid the outcome of a losing bet. 
She decides to get involved.
She goes to talk to Mike (Joe 
Mantegna) of the House of Games, 
a seedy billiard parlour on the 
second floor of an older section of 
the city. Mike likes her style and 
tells her that he will forgo the 
amount of the bet if she will help 
him. Mike is in a big money poker

Dance Alloy season opens
By DAWN BROSONSKI
Tartan Staffwriter
The Dance Alloy, a profes
sional contemporary dance 
company based in Pittsburgh, 
performs in concert and offers 
dance classes and lecture dem
onstrations across the United 
States and in Canada. Their 
1988/89 performance season 
opens next month with two 
returning dance pieces and one 
world premiere.
Lost Continent, choreo
graphed by Mark Taylor, world 
premiered in 1986. This dance 
piece combines movement, nar
ration and video to bring the 
past to life on the stage. In
volved is the exploration of 
dinosaurs, seen as monstrous 
creatures from long ago, and 
the examination of the human 
response to them, and to what 
else might frighten us. Lost 
Continent uses a number of 
themes for development, such 
as the concept of extinction, the 
intrigue of the unknown, and 
the question of why we some
times like to scare ourselves. 
Even the early days of ballet 
are touched upon as the danc
ers engage themselves in con
versation, while a screen is used 
to create shadowplay that hides 
and reveals images.
Lost Continent exists today 
partly in thanks to The Carne
gie, where Taylor would spend 
some of his time, walking 
through the many rooms and 
marveling especially at the 
remains of the prehistoric ani
mals. Artistic Director Elsa 
Limbach states that Taylor 
thought about how to express 
the ideas and feelings he had 
when he thought of the past, 
andhe combined his talent with 
that of video artist Ralph Vituccio from Carnegie Mellon Uni
versity to createLosi Continent.
The finishing touch is music by 
Borodin, Joan LaBarbara, The 
Mills Brothers, and Michael 
Moritz.
House Of Drawn Shades, 
which also came to the Dance 
Alloy in. 1986, is a complete 
change from the workings of Lost 
Continent. Choreographer Catlin Cobb uses dreams and im
ages to explore the mystery of 
the inner psyche in all of us. 
Just as dreams are often erratic 
and confusing, so are the rela
tionships that the dancers por
tray. Elsa Limbach describes 
House Of Drawn Shades as a 
form that investigates the pe
culiar but fascinating question 
that dreams have. The sound 
was engineered by Brooks Wil
liams, and the piece includes 
South American music, vocals 
by Ms. Cobb, and an original 
score by Williams.
This year the Dance Alloy will 
also introduce a world premiere 
piece choreographed by Stephen 
Koester, who gave the company 
his work Night Span in 1986. 
The piece was described by 
Limbach as a set of duets that 
represent r el ation ship s betwe en 
people and the energy and logic 
to them. This will delve a bit 
into a more emotional context, 
leaving behind the concepts of 
narration in thefirst two pieces.
The members of the Dance Al
loy include returning members 
Ginny Adams and Scott Timm. 
The first performance of the 
three works will be at the Mt. 
Lebanon High School Little 
Theatre on October 15, 1988 at 
8 pm. Performances following 
will be at the Eddy Theatre on 
the Chatham College campus 
on October 28 and 29, both shows 
at 8 pm, and on October 30 at 2 
pm. Tickets are $12 and can be 
obtained by calling Dance Alloy 
at (412) 621-6670 or by going to 
the theatre box office.
gambler from Las Vegas who has 
been taking him to the cleaners.'
Mike noticed that this guy has 
a tell, meaning that he uncon
sciously does something under 
certain circumstances. In the case 
of this gambler he twists a gold 
ring worn on his pinky whenever 
he is bluffing.
The doctor agrees to help Mike 
by acting as his girlfriend and 
sitting in as a good luck piece. 
When the big money hand is tak
ing place, Mike will feel an urgent 
call of nature and she will watch 
for the tell.
To tell you what happens next 
would be a crime, but she does 
convince Mike to let her write a 
book about the confidence game. 
During the writing of the book 
you can guess about the relation
ship that is built between thdm.
Through this we learn a great 
deal about how the game is played. 
We-also learn that the definition 
of the confidence game is not the 
one you find in the dictionary. 
According to Mamet, the confi
dence in confidence game is the 
confidence that the con man shows 
in his victim. That confidence is 
then returned by a gift.
Lindsay Crouse debuts in this 
film as the psychiatrist whose life 
is mostly together. She plays her 
part well, acting as the cold, clini
cal psychiatrist whose main love 
is her work, but realizes that it is 
slowly driving her crazy. She has 
a few Freudian slips which help 
an associate convince her to work 
on things she enjoys, like writing 
books. Crouse then shows the 
change in character as Doctor 
Ford begins to relax and fall under 
the spell of Mike and the confi
dence game.
Joe Mantegna is perfectly cast 
as Mike the confidence man, help
ing Doctor Ford to understand 
how the game is played. He is a 
slick dresser, always in a suit, 
with a face that is criminal yet 
still good looking enough to make 
the relationship between the pair 
believable.
David Mamet acts as screen
writer and also steps into the 
directors chair. He does a good 
job of keeping the pace brisk and 
of creating realistic dialogue. The 
previews for this movie said that 
Mamet has a feel for the way 
people talk, and he does.
Someone recently explained to 
me the difference between a 
mystery and a thriller. A mystery 
is where the audience doesnt 
know who did it. A thriller is where 
they do know who did it. This 
movie is one of the best thrillers 
that I have seen and I recommend 
it to everyone. There may not be 
any naked people or car chases, 
but it will certainly keep you on 
the edge of your seat.
House of Games plays through 
Thursday at 7:00 and 9:00 pm at 
the Pittsburgh Playhouse. Call 
621-4445 for ticket information.

Footes Habitation of Dragons has 
premiere at Pgh. Public Theater
By LAURA McILRATH
Tartan Staffwriter
To Kill a Mockingbird, The Trip 
to Bountiful, Tender Mercies  
what do they have in common? 
Yes, theyre three great movies, 
but so are lots of other movies. 
These particular three were writ
ten by a man named Horton Foote, 
a patriarch of the drama and film 
community.
Now you have the opportunity 
to see his latest work, The Habi
tation of Dragons, at the Pitts
burgh Public Theater as part of 
their new season. As a matter of 
fact, its not just coming to Pitts
burgh, its making its world pre
miere here. You can see it now, up 
until the 23rd of October, before it 
hits Broadway.
As well as writing three Acad
emy award winning screenplays, 
Foote has been recognized as a 
major-modern playwright to be 
ranked with Eugene ONeill and 
Tennessee Williams. Footes work 
is characterized by its simple 
style, which achieves more com
plex and powerful emotional ef
fects than a more complex work 
might. His latest play is a bold 
and absorbing family drama set 
in Texas.
The cast includes two CMU 
graduates and two actors who
have participated in CMUs sum
mer repertoire theater. Also in
cluded in the production will be 
Eugenia Rawls - a veteran of 
Broadway productions of such 
classics as The Childrens Hour, 
Little Foxes, and Private Lives. 
You may also recognize actors 
from shows like As The World 
Turns, Kate and Allie and Guid
ing Light and movies such as 
Tightrope and Biloxi Blues.
Bill Gardner, the theaters di
rector, describes Habitation as 
the most ambitious project in 
our 14 year history. Because of 
its significance and scope the 
production has been awarded a 
special grant of over $38,000 by 
the Pennsylvania Council on the 
Arts.
Everyone working on the pro
duction is confident that their 
money and effort will pay off and, 
given the people involved, it seems 
a safe bet. Its been a long time 
since a production this exciting 
has premiered in Pittsburgh, and 
we may have to wait quite a while 
until such an event comes again.
The rest of the season at the 
PPT promises to be as good. The 
Tony award winning comedy Im 
Not Rappaport is the second play 
of the season, followed by The 
Immigrant: A Hamilton County 
Album and then more comedy
with Noel Cowards hilarious 
Fallen Angels.
Pittsburghs most acclaimed 
actress, Helena Ruoti, stars in a 
new adaptation of Ibsens Hedda 
Gabler, the seasons fifth produc
tion. The last play of the season is 
as yet undetermined, but the thea
ter is hoping to get the rights to 
Fences, by Pulitzer Prize winning 
Pittsburgher August Wilson.
Another thing to look for is a 
film series of Horton Footes work 
commemorating the premiere of 
The Habitation of Dragons. The 
films will be shown until October 
30. The first two, which will be 
shown in the Carnegie Museum 
of Art screening hall, are Tender 
Mercies (9/30) and The Trip To 
Bountiful (10/7). Mr. Foote is 
scheduled to appear in person at 
Bountiful. Showing at Pitts David 
Lawrence Hall auditorium in the 
following weeks are Courtship (10/ 
16), On Valentines Day (10/23), 
and 1918 (10/30). Admission is 
$2.50 for students, senior citizens 
and members of the Carnegie, 
$3.00 for everyone else.
The Habitation of Dragons is 
currently in previews at the Pitts
burgh Public Theater on Allegheny 
Square downtown. It opens to
morrow night for the Pittsburgh 
and world premiere. For tickets 
and information call 321-9800.

ment and poke fun at the other 
short films in the Festival. The 
other short films include The 
Great Cognito, Dinosaur, The Leg
acy, and The Christmas Gift. Each 
of the short films is a prime ex
ample of the Claymation art form. 
Vinton, the master of the mephoto courtesy Expanded Entertainment/ Activities Board dium, uses clay figurines as acWeeere Heeeere! Yes, its those singin, dancin dried grapes, the California Raisins, seen here tors and animates them by hand,
in their big scene from Will Vintons Festival of Claymation. instead of using drawn images on
paper. The process of posing 
and filming is repeated so to 
create the illusion of movement.
The technique has been used 
successfully in many commer
cials for such products as The 
California Raisins, where a 
line of raisins sing and dance; 
Dominos Pizza, where the 
Noid, a pizza-hating gremlin, 
does his unsuccessful best in 
trying to destroy a pizza box; 
and Kentucky Fried Chicken, 
where confused mutated 
burgerlike chickens dance and 
cavort merrily. The process had 
also been used in a music video 
for John Fogerty called Vanz

Breathless
Unlike the 1983 travesty, this is the real thing. JeanLuc Godard did nothing conventional in his debut as 
director, breaking all rules of cinematic continuity in 
his tribute to gangster films. Much more than a simple 
gangster movie, Godards fast-moving yet erotic film 
influenced the industry like no other of the time. 
Starring: Jean-Paul Belmondo, Jean Seberg 
Directed by Jean-Luc Godard 
At: 6, 8, and 10
Friday, September 30 
Off Limits
Yet another movie set in Vietnam, only this one is so 
ridiculous that you wont realize it. The characters 
certainly dont. Willem Dafoe comes back to Vietnam, 
accompanied by Gregory Hines, in order to chase down 
a prostitute killer. Sounds like fun, and all this with a 
war going on, too. Could be interesting if youre as far 
out of reality as this movie is.
Starring: Willem Dafoe, Gregory Hines 
Directed by Christopher Crowe 
At 6, 8, and 10
Saturday, October 1 
To Be Announced
Tor those of you new to campus, TBA on the movie 
schedule usually means skin flick on the movie 
screen, but not always. Keep your eye on the Gray 
Matter poster frames, or call xFLMS during the week 
for info.
Starring: some body
Directed by nobody you should be familiar with.
At: Good question.
Sunday, October 2 
Claymation Festival
Even though claymation has been overexploited to 
the point of nausea, this should have a bit more 
originality than those damned Raisins. (See page 9 of 
this issue for more particulars.)
Starring: plasticine and Play-Doh.

World-class work from Pgh. Symphony 
makes Yoel Levi sound halfway decent
The Pittsburgh Symphony 
Orchestra showed that it truly is 
a world-class ensemble Friday 
night, by playing brilliantly for a 
not-so-brilliant conductor. It may 
seem unfair to place all the blame  
for a mediocre concert on one 
person, but the orchestra played 
so well that it would be pointless 
to try and find any fault with
them. Guest conductor___________
Yoel Levi, music direc
tor of the Atlanta Sym
phony, used no scores 
for the concert, an im
pressive enough feat 
especially considering 
the relative complex
ity of Coplands Sym
phony No. 3 (the sec
ond half of the concert). However, 
the purpose of a conductor memo
rizing the score is not to impress, 
but to be able to communicate 
more directly with the orchestra. 
Levi defeated this purpose by 
looking most of the time at *the 
floor or at the spot where his score 
would have been placed.
In Beethovens Overture to The 
Creatures of Prometheus, Levi was 
moderately successful, eliciting 
clean and stylistically accurate 
playing from the orchestra. The 
architecture of the piece was also 
fairly clear, but this was due more 
to the pieces brevity and built-in 
structure than to Levis direction.
The concert continued with 
Horacio Gutierrez as soloist in 
the Chopin Piano Concerto No. 1. 
A popular guest on the Tonight 
Show, Gutierrez is well liked by 
audiences of all kinds, including 
Fridays less-than-capacity Heinz 
Hall crowd. He played the con
certo with wonderful lyricism, 
never forcing the sound even in 
the loudest passages. The final 
movement was particularly en
joyable, as the soloist brought out 
every measure of Chopins in
tended pianistic sparkle.
After intermission came a per
formance of Coplands Symphony 
No. 3, a work that could easily be 
called the American symphony 
for its distinctive style similar to 
the same composers Appalachian 
Spring. The quiet opening of the 
work was unfortunately spoiled 
by the fact that Levi did not wait 
long enough for the crowd or-the 
orchestra to get settled before 
beginning, resulting in insecure 
playing on the orchestras part 
and an unsettled feeling for the 
listener. Very quickly, though, the 
orchestra settled into a perform
ance high above standards set in 
recent years. The Copland was, in 
terms of playing, much better than 
a performance of the same work
by the Philadelphia Orchestra 
that I heard in January. How
ever, Levis inability to connect 
ideas, to shape phrases, and gen
erally to make musical sense of 
the piece made the performance 
far less appealing in an artistic 
sense.
Praise for the orchestra is welldeserved nevertheless, and I
wouldnt be fair if I didnt men
tion some specific examples. 
Throughout the Copland, co-prin
cipal oboist Cynthia DeAlmedas 
playing was flawless and her tone 
rich and singing. The woodwind 
playing in general was excellent, 
including several difficult and 
very exposed piccolo solos played 
by Ethan Stang. The opening of
the last movement (a statement 
based on Coplands earlier Fan
fare for the Common Man) show
cased good playing from horns 
and low brass but fell far short of 
its potential majesty as Levi failed 
to bring out the inherent archi
tecture of the section.
One would hope that this high 
level of playing can be maintained 
throughout the sea
son, and if it can, 
music director 
Lorin Maazels ar
rival in November 
may herald the 
beginning of a new 
era for the Pitts
burgh Symphony. 
Levi returns next 
week for three performances next 
weekend (Friday at 8, Saturday 
at 8:30, and Sunday at 2:30) of a 
program featuring Saint-Sans 
Organ Symphony as well as works 
by Hindemith and Glazunov. Free 
Pre-Concert Conversations one 
hour before each of the concerts 
will feature Jim Cunningham 
(WQED) speaking with Patricia
Prattis Jennings (PSO keyboard 
player) about the Saint-Sans.
Elsewhere in Pittsburgh this 
coming week pianist Eunice Nor
ton continues her marathon 
seven-week, seven-concert series 
of the 32 Beethoven Piano Sona
tas. This Sunday at 4 she will 
play the second program in the 
series which celebrates her 80th 
birthday. The concerts are free 
and take place at Frick Fine Arts 
Auditorium in Oakland.
A Wednesday-night concert (9/ 
28) at Frick features Hariprasad 
Chaurasia, billed as Indias fore
most flutist, and tabla player 
Sabir Khan. For tickets or infor
mation call 963-8023 or 624-4126. 
Chaurasia will also appear oh 
Carnegie Mellons Music Depart
ment Convocation Thursday at 
12:30 in a free performance/leoture which is also open to the 
public. His visit to Pittsburgh is 
sponsored by the Pitt and Carne

Relations.

IPF salutes 
T.S. Eliot
By STEPHEN GLICKER

The International Poetry 
Forum will open this years 
season on October 5th with a 
salute to the renowned poet 
T.S. Eliot. The Salute cele
brates the Nobel Awardee in 
Literature as a major figure 
in 20th century letters.
T.S. Eliot is responsible for 
many literary masterpieces, 
such as Rhapsody on a Windy 
Night, Preludes, The Waste 
hand, Old Possum's Book of 
Practical Cats (which the 
Broadway production of Cats 
is entirely based on), and sev
eral others.
The tribute will begin on 
his one-hundredth birthday 
and continue until October 
10th. Many ofhis finest poems 
and several scenes from his 
best plays are expected to be 
read.
On October 5th, Jill Balcon

Society of Teachers and 
Speech and Drama and Vice 
President of the Nation Po
etry Centre. Gabriel Woolf

an actor in England venues 
as well as at the Library of 
Congress.
The Word in the Desert 
was presented by Ms. Balcon 
and Mr. Woolf at the Univer
sity of London before Mrs. 
Valerie Eliot and will be fea
tured as part of the official 
centenary ceremonies this 
fall.
On October 10th, poets

Gorilla aardvarking, Chuck Fu, and no breasts
Out at the zoo in San Diego, 
they have a boy gorilla and a girl 
gorilla that like to paw at each 
other and root around in the dirt 
and make loud screaming noises 
and then smoke cigarettes in front 
of the elementary school kids that 
come out for a field trip and end 
up getting the words reproduc
tive system explained to em. In 
other words, these gorillas are 
like a sailor and a two-dollar 
hooker  they 
get right down to 
business. Butthe 
TROUBLE with 
these two goril
las, and all the 
other270 gorillas 
in the zoos, is that 
they never have 
any little baby 
gorillas, and now the New York 
Times says all the gorillas might 
die out in a few years.
I have a few suggestions:
1. Dont show the gorillas the 
New York Times. Besides mak
ing em depressed, theyd lose 
interest in everything ELSE they 
do.
2. Get the homy gorillas OUT of 
San Diego. Nobody should have 
to mate in the presence of Joan 
Embry.
3. Some of the girl gorillas are 
aborting their babies. Send some 
Right-to-Lifers into the cages to 
talk to the gorillas about the 
advantages of carrying the goril
la to term and then GIVING IT 
AWAY to a good Christian ba
boon family. This will have abso
lutely no effect on the gorillas, but 
the Right-to-Lifers will enjoy the 
debate.
4. Confine the lady gorillas to 
their cages. Overthe last ten years 
a lot of the female apes have been 
competing against the male goril
las for leaves and berries. Most of 
them dont; believe they have 
TIME for baby gorillas.
5. Get all the available gorilla 
families to gang up on the babyless gorillas and jump up and 
down on their heads until they 
realize what a joy it is to have 
babies. Make sure any actual 
gorilla babies are kept out of sight 
during this procedure.
6. If natural methods fail, buy 
some gorilla babies from Mexican 
zoos.
7. Set up a loudspeaker with 
the voice of Jane Goodall saying 
over and over, Youre not getting 
any younger, youre not getting 
any younger...
8. Teach zoo employees to pound 
baby gorillas over the head and 
drop them off eight-foot ledges, to 
show the grown-up gorillas that 
the normal parental tasks can be 
handled by day care.
9. Tell the girl gorilla shes a fat 
pig and shell never get another 
male gorilla until she loses 280 
pounds.
10. Tell the girl gorilla hell love 
her again once he feels the warm
ance to his double-barreled pumpaction shotgun. Theres some reli
gious geeks out there dying, and 
Bronson dont like it.
Its the drive-in Chinatown. 
No breasts. Twenty-two dead
glow of fatherhood. Under no cir- bodies. Two motor vehicle chases, 
cumstances should this part be including the first Blazer-in-atold to the boy gorilla.
Speaking of romantic comedies, 
Messenger of Death is the new 
Bronson flick, and it has Charles
w *\To The Drive-InI
in the role hes been waiting all 
his life to play  a Denver news
paper reporter. The only problem 
is, when Chuck goes out to a Colo
rado farmhouse to take notes on 
the mass murder of three women 
and six kids, it BOTHERS him. 
Then, when he almost gets run off 
the road by a giant water truck, it 
bothers him even more. Then, 
when he finds out that some 
weirdo Mormon families, de
scended from a long line of cous
ins, are ready to blow one another 
away for blood atonement, 
Chuck decides to go to church and 
ask God to give blessing and guidwater-truck-sandwich stunt. 
Exploding casket. Manson Fu. 
Mormon Fu. Mens room Fu.

12The Tartan * Carnegie Mellon  27 September 1988
Pitt Theatre starts season
By MICHAEL SCHWARTZ
Tartan Staffwriter
Our friends at the University of Pitts
burgh are pleased to announce their 1988-
89 theatre season. This years season is 
to include selections from several differ
ent European playwrights. Together with 
veterans oftheThree Rivers Shakespeare 
Festival, faculty and current students of 
the graduate acting program, Pitts di
rectors and designers of theTheatre Arts 
Department are waiting for you.
The season opens on October 7 with 
The Caretaker, a tragedy/comedy by 
Harold Pinter. The director will be David 
Weidman, who directed the musical 
smash Baby last year and another play 
entitled Birdbath in 1986.
Some time after the close of The Care
taker Pitt will begin production of The 
Cherry Orchard, a classic play by Anton 
Chekhov. The director is Stephen Cole
man, noted director of six Shakespear
ean Festival productions as well as 
teacher, director and actor for the Uni
versity Theatre since 1981. Cherry Or
chard is a blend of farce and tragedy as 
the characters stubbornly lead their lives 
while holding on to childish egotism as 
their world crumbles around them.
Starting off the new year is The Physi
cists, a tale of three mad scientists who 
plot to deprive the world of all scientific 
advancement. Written by Friedrich Dr
renmatt, the play will be directed by 
Peter Harrigan. A talented costume 
designer as well as director, Harrigan 
earned his masters in directing at Pitt 
and is now an instructor in the Theatre 
Arts Department.
Coming in February is Janusz 
Glowackis Hunting Cockroaches. It is 
the story of an immigrant Polish couples 
struggle to make it in America. The play 
will be directed by Rick Van Noy, who 
directed Educating Rita last season.
The final show of the season will be 
...And a Nightingale Sang, by C. P. 
Taylor. The director is Mavoureen Dwyer, 
originally from Canada, who joined the 
Pitt faculty in 1987. She made her Pitts
burgh actingdebutin Pitts 1988production of Baby and in this summers Three 
Rivers Shakespeare Festival.
This year promises to be another de
lightful season. All shows will begin at 8 
pm on Wednesday through Saturday as 
well as at 2 pm on Sundays at the Stephen 
Foster Memorial Theater and the Studio 
Theatre. For more information, please 
call 624-PLAY (624-7529).
John Hiatt is on tonight
By PETER ALBERT
Tartan Staffwriter
Today is the day to see Graffiti's fea
tured artist of the week. I know that it 
doesnt give you much time but, John 
Hiatt and the Goners are undoubtedly 
worth it. With the release of his new 
album, Slow Turning, and his being 
named as the best male singer in RollingStones 1987 critics poll, John Hiatt 
is destined to become known as one of 
rocks best to a much wider audience.
The show is being previewed as good 
old rock and roll. Dont let thatfool you. 
John Hiatt is not just rock and roll. His 
music contains the kind of variety that 
has gained him a substantial cult fol
lowing. A country blues-soul man bet
ter describes his style. He has been 
compared to such artists as Randy 
Newman, Elvis Costello, andTheBand.
Hiatts lyrics are riveting. Artists 
such as Bob Dylan and Ry Cooderhave 
recorded some of his works. He has 
also written for country musicians 
Rosanne Cash and Conway Twitty. 
Thiskindofraremusician comes along 
once in a great while.
So if you want to see John Hiatt and 
the Goners before the others, along 
with Johnny Rhythm and the Dimestore 45s, come down to Graffiti 
tonight. It will be a night that will go 
down in Pittsburghs own rock history. 
The show starts at 8:30 and tickets are 
$10.50 in advance and $12.00 at the 
door.

Yeah, the kids are alright
By DAN BIPWA
Tartan Staffwriter
If you missed the Ramones, no 
problem - theyll undoubtedly 
tour yet again, just like theyve 
been doing for the last skidillion 
years. If you missed Rapeman, 
and most of you did cause it wasnt 
that crowded, you might be able 
to hear better than those who 
didnt, but we had a better time. 
So there.
Xhis seems to be the 
year of reggae progeny.
First Ziggy Marley re
leases an album and goes 
on tour. Now Andrew 
Tosh, the son of Peter 
Tosh, is on tour, with an 
album to follow soon. 
Considering how popu
lar both youngsters 
parents were, with Bob 
Marley at near-god status in the 
Rastafarian community and Tosh 
at mega-star status at least, the 
new up-and-comings have their 
work cut out for them.
Then again, record companies 
are going to be looking at these 
guys with greed in their eyes. 
Nothing sells so well as a name, 
and big names mean big bucks. 
As a result, the record companies 
are going to be throwing a huge 
wad of support at these records 
instead of possibly going out and 
finding new artists, or supporting
lesser-known ones like Ini 
Kamoze or Big Youth, or maybe 
trying their corporate hands at 
some dance-hall chanters. (Dancehall is reggaes answer to rap, 
sort of.) I mean, Ziggys album 
was okay, but did it sweep any
body off their feet, really? Any
way, Andrew Tosh will be at 
Graffiti on the fifteenth, along 
with the band that used to play 
behind his father. With the same
Music Music Music 
Th
REVIEW
band, it should sound pretty 
similar to the elder Tosh. Check it 
out for yourself, and see what you 
think.
Just think what the record 
companies would be doing if Elvis 
had had a kid.
Editors Note: Elvis did have a 
kid. In fact, he had several. Not 
all of them were legitimate, but 
nevertheless they exist. The rec
ord companies leave them alone 
because none of them can sing.

Exploring CMUs
This hatch (above), found in the 
Ne level of Doherty Hall near the 
fourth floor of Wean Hall, leads 
(right) into the Doherty steam 
tunnel. (Entrance El on map.)
Because of the danger to all that enter them, the steam tunnels are 
jocked and anyone found in the tunnels will be subject to serious discipli
nary action. The security office is responsible for keeping the tunnels locked 
'.and apprehending anyone trespassing.
Student Handbook, page 30
Is it worth risking your academic careers for ? And besides, youll never 
get in anyway.
Since Converted Doubter
Above: The Doherty tunnel runs the length of 
Doherty Hall.
It was Friday night. We could have been out partying. Instead, armed 
with flashlights and a crude map, we were in search of the legendary 
Carnegie Mellon steam tunnels.
Our first target was a floor grate somewhere in the basement of Scaife 
Hall. We exited the elevator, realizing that there was no sign of a grate, 
but there were some ten odd doors. Not certain what to do, we tried all the 
door handles. More than half were unlocked. Our random opening strat
egy seemed less wise after we noticed the alarms on all the doors. Warily 
opening the last door, an entrance to a large engineering lab, Stefan spied 
a large grate inset in the floor. A youngish man stepped out, and asked if 
he could help us. Marc and I ran up the stairs. Stefan, 
in a near spasm of panic, answered back with Is this 
the HH20 computer cluster? Probably having dealt 
with this sort of thing many times, the man directed 
him off in the general direction of Hamerschlag. Obvi
ously, this was not going to be as simple as we had 
hoped.
We proceeded to the C level of Hamerschlag, where 
another entrance was supposed to be located. Im not 
sure what we expected, but there werent any signs 
marked This way to steam tunnel. We pried open all 
the suspicious looking doors, and found some paint 
(obviously used on the fence in years past). Eventually,
Marc found a door, which upon intensive architectural
continued on page L5
The above picture was taken in the longest steam tunnel (labelled F in 
the map below), directly below the College of Fine Arts. The passageway 
pictured leads to CFA and on to GSIA; the tunnel also reaches Margaret 
Morrison, the Gym, Doherty Hall, and the Robotics Institute in Wean 
Hall. Below: Grafitti located somewhere under the middle of the Cut.
"Above the door was a 
hole, about two feet by 
one foot, leading into a 
stairwell.... 
There are at least six major 
steam tunnels under the CMU 
campus. The average tunnel is 
eight feet high and six to ten feet 
wide, although these measure
ments vary widely in places. The 
entrances are evenly split between 
doors and grates. While the grates 
are usually unlocked, tools are 
required to pull them open.
Tunnel A connects the base
ment of Scaife hall to E level in 
Hamerschlag. The Scaife en
trance (Al) is inset into the floor 
of a lab directly to the right of 
elevator in the basement. The 
entrance in Hamerschlag (A2) is 
in a physical plant area, locked as 
of our investigation.
From Hamerschlag, there are 
two other tunnels, B and C. The B 
tunnel, which leads from Hamer
schlag to a hill near the Bureau of 
Mines, has an entrance (Bl) on F
Carnegie MellorTs other network
level behind two locked steel 
doors to the right of the eleva
tor. There is not a reasonable 
entrance from the Panther 
Hollow side.
The C tunnel entrance (Cl) 
is inside the Hamerschlag 
boiler room, which is accessible 
through a locked door next to 
the Flexible Manufacturing 
Lab on level C. There is pre
sumably at least one other 
entrance (C2) in the Robotics 
Lab. The Porter entrance (C3) 
to this tunnel is a locked door 
at the bottom of a flight of stairs 
from the lower level. At the top 
of the stairs is a sign which 
reads HARD HAT AREA.
In Baker/Porter is the D 
tunnel which runs the length 
of the buildings. There are at 
least three entrances to this

CMU alum Allen Greenberg helps Pittsburgh mayoral candidate
By KHRISTINA MAYES
Tartan Staffwriter
Now that hes graduated from CMU, 
Allen Greenberg works at the campaign 
headquarters of Pittsburgh mayoral 
candidate Michelle Madoff. Hes respon
sible for organizing volunteers for fund 
raising drives and other activities. Green
berg also deals with many press-related 
issues.
Greenberg was a liberal chairman and 
co;founder of Student Senates Rules
These are the issues, 
and these are Michelles 
proposals.
Allen Greenberg
Committee. During his tenure on the 
Student Senate, he instigated the Hous
ing Privacy Policy, worked for the Politi
cal Speakers Forum Board, and made 
many Constitutional changes. He did a 
lot of work for the Free Speech Policy; 
before, outsiders of the university were 
not allowed to come onto campus and 
petition, a policy that Greenberg found 
disgusting and deplorable. He 
prompted a policy which is now in the 
handbook concemingnon-discrimination 
against sexual orientation. A political 
agitator in Senate, he also tried to ban 
classified research. In addition, he was a 
strong backer of the Student Union.
Greenberg has definite goals for 
Madoffs campaign. We want to present 
the candidate to the press in order to 
bring forth her platform, he stated.
Madoff has had some problems with 
the press. One of the biggest hurdles in 
her campaign is that the press has taken 
the punch out of context. It often ap
pears that she is not capable of address
ing the issues, Greenberg commented.
Tartan file photo
Allen Greenberg graduated from CMU 
last year. Now he's working for 
Councilwoman Michelle Madoff.
Recently, KDKA did an editorial over 
the radio, saying Michelle Madoff ac
cuses Jim Roddey of being a carpetbag
ger because hes not from Pittsburgh. 
Maybe she forgot SHE was bom in Can
ada. According to Greenberg, such offthe-cuff remarks made by Madoff hurt 
her campaign because the press has 
seized them rather than her real issues.
These are the issues, and these are 
Michelles proposals, is the way Green
berg likes to deal with the press. Shes 
very good with the press. Shes fairly 
creative. Madoff is a champion of minor
ity rights, an advocate of day care, and 
part of the Pittsburgh Literacy Initia
tive.
Our strategy will be to deal honestly 
and, in a straightforward manner, out
line what is great about our city and 
what needs to be done to make it better, 
said Greenberg. Madoff addresses the 
issue that the city is limited in taxing the 
wages of the people in the suburbs  
most of whom commute to the city to 
work daily. She also favors the gay rights 
ordinance and is trying to propose ways
to apply for Federal Grants which will 
help the despair in the black communj. 
ties of the city that are falling apart.
Our goal is to bring across to the 
public that this person that they already, 
know is not only tough and a watchdog, 
but eminently qualified and capable of 
carrying out executive duties, said 
Greenberg. Although Madoff is an outspoken, and liberal member of City 
Council, her opposition doesnt believe 
that she could do the executive and ad
ministrative work of a mayor. Some 
question her executive ability, Green
berg states. His job is to show that work 
on city council here is of high executive 
and administrative status.
To aid in this task, Greenberg arranges 
community groups and town meetings 
so that she has the opportunity to inter
act with residents, offer proposals, inter
ests, and concerns. He concluded by 
saying that the city and its people would 
benefit by placing her in such a position,"

Dear Specs,
I want to stop drinking alco

the pain?
Cold Turkey
Dear C.T.,
Have you thought about con
tracting Old Lyme Disease? It 
will enable you to suffer short 
term memory loss, blurry vi
sion, and intense irritability. 
Most people exhibit these traits 
when they drink, so you can fit 
right in. (Most people wont 
even know that you quit. Al
though the disease can be fa
tal, drunk driving casualties 
are much higher in number.) If 
you cant find a tick carrying
O.L.D., and you dont want to 
turn to drugs to enhance your 
earnings, be prepared for a 
bumpy ride socially.
A rabbit, frozen by the head
lights of an oncoming car, will 
share your glassy stare. Going 
to parties will not be quite the 
same. You will be observing 
the lurching, leering, and lust
ing of drinkers that you call 
friends. Completely sober, you 
might find the sight horrify
ing. Unlike the rabbit, though, 
you must break from staring 
transfixed. And move out of 
the way.
So do it!

No Social Life
Dear No Soc,
The football field is a giant ditch 
filled with bulldozers. The IM 
Field is a parking lot. The cut, in 
front of the Fence, is a Phi Kap 
dumping ground.
The green grass adjacent to the 
tennis courts is now a tricycle 
proving ground for the preschool
ers. Regardless of your inspira
tion to join a team, unfortunately 
CMU facilities cant meet the 
need. You have two solutions. 
Either you can take up an intel
lectual sporttoss dangling par
ticiples around the H&SS lounge, 
join Dungeons and Dragons in 
Gray Matter, etc.  or dress the 
part. Look like a sportsman. Buy 
a Fila tennis ensemble and hover 
around Salads Plus. If your sched
ule doesnt permit this luxury, 
wear white and carry a few rac
quets around with you. This will 
stimulate conversations among 
your peers and you will certainly 
be the center of attention.

Dear Specs,

population here? Should I do it, 
or not? How do you tie them 
anyway?
In the Dark
Dear ITD,
Looking like you are ship
wrecked on a desert island is 
the theme many of these men 
are trying to convey. They take 
a scissor to their pants legs, 
just above the knee, grab an an
cient t-shirt and dont tie their 
shoelaces.
Then they clump around the 
cut like a combination of Gilligan and Robinson Crusoe. If 
you want to fit in, yell Ahoy, 
Mate! when you see one. If 
they respond in kind, go buy 
some ethnic napkins and follow 
the following directions.
1. Go to the mirror. Blow dry 
your hair. If you dont it could 
grow mouldy under the rug.
2. Grip your hair tightly with 
your hands. Try to estimate the 
size. Pick out a kerchief that 
will stretch around the circum
ference.
3. Fiddle with it for a while 
and then tie the corners in a 
knot in the back. Practice say
ing To, dude or Cool while 
doing the knot, to save time. 
Otherwise youll have to make 
up for it later.
Youre done! It only took an 
extra hour to achieve that chain 
gang appeal.
But dont worry, youre worth
it.

Study Abroad Day to play Gray Matter
By C. LOMONICO
Tartan Staffwriter
If you are planning to study 
abroad or just thinking about it, 
you shouldnt miss Study Abroad 
Day in Skibo Gray Matter on 
October 4th from 9:00-5:00. This 
is the first time the International 
Education Office has organized 
such an event, which is designed 
to spread awareness about study
ing abroad while receiving credit, 
knowledge about how to go about 
it, and the opportunities and abili
ties in every field of study.
Students can study abroad in 
five different ways: by enrolling 
in a program sponsored by an 
American college or university, 
enrolling in a special program for 
international students at a for
eign university, directly enroll
ing in a foreign university, enroll
ing in a program sponsored by an 
independent organization, or
a37I u2TRm7 wmI
Where: Gray Matter 
When: October 4, 9:00-5:00
enrolling in an international or 
American college abroad.
Representatives from seven 
different organizations with pro
grams, CMUs Office for Interna
tional Education, and exchange 
programs to Switzerland, France, 
and Japan will be present on 
October 4th. Attractions include 
slide shows and students who 
have returned from studying 
abroad.
Christiane Huckin, the Coordi
nator of International Education, 
began working with CMU stu
dents who wanted to study abroad 
in October 1985. Previously, the 
office was directed towards for
eign students studying at CMU.
Nothing was being done for CMU 
students who wanted to go abroad, 
and many students didnt even 
realize the possibility existed.
The office has seen tremendous 
growth of the program in the last 
three years. Huckin hopes to have 
a more in-depth coordination with 
the registrars office, so that e 
can get a better idea of how many 
students go abroad. At this point, 
it is difficult to say how many stu
dents go abroad through differ
ent programs and universities.
Huckin stresses the importance 
of studying abroad to build ; 
understanding of other cultures 
while increasing a healthy com
petition in various fields of study, 
She also hopes for further growtli 
of the program she has developed 
for Carnegie Mellon students by 
expanding the capabilities of hej 
office and generating more aware
ness programs for studying 
abroad.

Zaslow on life
The following are excerpts from Jeff Zaslows 
talk a week ago:
Question: I have call waiting service on my tele
phone. When I call one person, and another one 
calls, is it okay to abandon the first person for the 
second? Is there any particular etiquette I should 
use?
So I said, If you decide to talk to the second 
caller, apologize profusely to the first usingphrases 
like emergency, long distance and very ill. You 
are perfectly welcome to stay with first caller and 
ignore the clicking. If you both have call waiting, 
and you both get calls at the same time, you may 
hang up on each other simultaneously with no 
hard feelings.
Question: I dropped out of high school without 
graduating. My ten year reunion is coming up and 
Id like to go, should I?
I said, Go to the reunion and have a good time, i 
Most of your former classmates will be too busy 
worrying about their own appearances to remem
ber if you graduated. If some snob brings it up, 
reply, "Youre right, I didnt graduate. By. the way, 
what happened to your face? 
Question: Every time my mother-in-law visits, 
she snoops around the house asking questions 
like, How much does that cost? Its like shes ap
praising everything weve got. How can I respond?
So I said, If your mother-in-law7 asks, How 
much does this cost? politely respond, Its not for 
sale. 
Im a Wall Street Journal reporter. What do I 
know about advice? -

Columnist Jeff Zaslow returns to campus for seminar
By STEWART LEVINE
WTartan Contributing Editor
Dear Ann,
I hear that your job is soon going 
'p be available ? What advice would 
j,on give to a would-be applicant ? 
-Wondering on Wall Street
-Dear Wondering,
Dont wish too hard for any
thing. You just might get it.
For Jeff Zaslow (Creative Writ
ing 80) it was another story as a 
;feature writer at The Wall Street 
:Journal. Ann Landers had left 
the Chicago Sun-Times and the 
diewspaper decided to hold a con[dsest to replace her.
-< When the contest was over, 
-Zaslow had a great story to write, 
'fie also found himself with a new 
jjbb  lone man in the advice 
"sorority.
Zaslow returned to campus last 
Sunday for a student leadership 
conference sponsored by Student 
Activities. There he explained how 
rhe got involved in the advice 
business. I entered this contest 
(|p write about it for The Wall 
Street Journal. I didnt think that 
J/d win. When I was doing the 
.application, I was looking for ways 
o be different. When I won, I was 
stuck doing it.
The former Tartan Editor-In[Qhief had some very tough com
petition. So many of the letters
were from housewives and people 
who felt that hard luck qualified 
themselves for the job. One 
woman said, Ive had five chil
dren, three husbands, two strokes 
and Ive been evicted from my 
house. Im qualified. Another 
said, Im writing this in longhand 
because my typewriter was sto
len ten years ago. One woman 
wrote, Im so good at giving adBefore school and 
after school, Ive never 
met as many wierdos 
as I did at CMU.
Jeff Zaslow
vice I helped my husband get back 
together with his girlfriend. A 
transvestite explained how he was 
equally qualified to answer ques
tions from both sexes, he said.
However, Zaslow made the first 
cut and the second, explaining, 
They cut down from 12,000 to 
108, they kept cutting down to 22, 
finally down to seven. When they 
got down to seven, they had this 
big media blitz. Countless news
paper writers and TV reporters 
asked the same questions. They 
asked, How can you do this? 
Youre so young! And I said, Im 
28, but I have the wisdom of a 29- 
year old. 
Finally, in the spring of 1987,
Zaslow received the nod. He now 
writes a column called All that 
Zazz five days a week in forty 
papers nationwide. His column is 
a departure from the traditional 
letters to the expert approach. 
Zaslow solicits his Regular Joe 
Squada group of people named 
Joe, Josephine, or Joanne  for 
answers. He also will give unso
licited advice to celebrities, such 
as a recent essay which explains 
why George Bush needs to pay 
attention to his belt loops.
Its quite a different world from 
writing for The Wall Street Jour
nal, let alone The Tartan. When 
I was with the Journal I used to 
spend three weeks on a story and 
one week writing it. I dont have 
the luxury of time any more, he 
remarked.
Zaslows tenure at Carnegie 
Mellon was just as unusual as his 
current job. I transferred to Co
lumbia my sophomore year...I 
transferred, and everybody said 
good-bye. I didnt like it. I stayed 
a week.
I called [then H&SS Dean] 
Crecine and said I hate it. they 
wont give me housing. He al
lowed me to come back after a 
week.
So I wrote a story called I was 
a Teenage Transfer about the 
experience of transferring to Co
lumbia for a week. It ran here, 
and then it ran at Columbia. Then 
Carnegie Mellon decided to send

recent Leadership Conference. Zaslow served 
as Editor-in-Chief of The Tartan as a student.
it to all high school seniors to say Were better 
than the Ivy League, and Columbia didnt like 
that.
Even though it was his first trip-back in 
several years, things havent changed too much 
at CMU. He still remembers Freshman Orienta
tion as the only way to pick up girls.
Zaslow sums up his experiences at CMU in 
concise words. Before school and after school, 
Ive never met as many wierdos as I did at 
CMU.

Finding the tunnels
ontinued from page LI
unnel. Two of them (D1 and D2) 
are large, unlocked metal grates 
jet into the floor at fifty yard 
intervals. The third entrance (D3) 
js in the CMU Bookstore stockfoom. This door is locked and 
alarmed.
In Doherty there are entrances 
to two tunnels, E and F. The E 
tunnel runs the length of Doherty 
and has three entrances. The first 
(E3) is an unlocked grate near the 
tyottom of the stairs on the B 
basement. The second entrance 
jE2) is a locked door in a narrow 
hallway, off the main B basement 
nail. On this wall are several clos
ets. The entrance is turned ninety 
(jegrees to the others. Above this 
(Joor is a plaster ledge, which has 
1 hole which will accommodate 
most people. The last E tunnel 
entrance (El) is an unlocked yel
low grate, also on the B base
ment, about twenty feet from the 
fpurth floor of Wean Hall. Several 
^et past this grate is a locked 
floor (F2) which leads to the F 
thnnel.
' The F tunnel runs the width of
the campus from the gym to the 
Robotics Lab and has at least eight 
other entrances. The Gym en
trance (F9) is an unlocked wooden 
door in the basement, near the 
washing machines. The entrance 
from Margaret Morrison (F8) is 
two levels down from the front 
door, on the tennis-court side, in a 
physical plant room to the left of 
a ROTC supply room. The door 
has a lock, but is frequently left 
open.
There is an entrance (F7) im
mediately behind the Studio 
Theater which is an unlocked 
grate. There is an unlocked grate 
on the basement floor of CFA (F4) 
which is also an entrance. Under 
the rear steps of CFA (F5) is a 
locked grate, underneath the 
posters, which is another en
trance. In the bottom level of GSIA 
there is a north facing door (F6) 
which is an entrance. There is an 
entrance (F3) which lies at the 
intersection of two walkways on 
the mall, south of the security 
office. And lastly, there is an en
trance (FI) from the Robotics Lab, 
which is both locked and alarmed.

Tihink Were Alone Now. I dont 
believe in French films that dont 
have Gerard Depardieu in them. 
I dont believe in acquired tastes, 
after all, if you read this often 
epough you might find it funny. I
dont believe that the film Assault 
of the Killer Bimbos was a very 
good example of Swedish expres
sionist theatre. And most impor
tantly I dont believe that my

to fulfill their sadistic flagellation 
fantasies on my back.'
That covers the vast majority of 
the things that I find truly impor

right, but your duty to disagree 
with me.
The only thing I ask is that you 
dont pass the sardines.

Aspects of eating disorders
Last weeks column discussed 
the major symptoms of anorexia 
and bulimia. Here well describe 
some of the psychological aspects 
of these eating problems.
As Hilde Bruch has stated, 
anorexia involves the relentless
rienced by the person suffering 
from bulimia as something be
yond his or her control. They can 
be a source of shame and guilt, 
which results in increasing secre
tiveness about the behaviors, and 
isolation due to the increased

F I 2
pursuit of thinness, along with 
an intense fear of becoming fat. 
What others see and become 
alarmed about is the anorexics 
severe problem with being under
weight, may be experienced by 
the anorexic as the primary source 
of self-satisfaction and pride. In 
fact, anorexics may not see them
selves as underweight at all; they 
may not feel hungry or even that 
they need to eat.
Despite the anorexics effort to 
control diet and weight, despite 
significant weight loss, there is 
often the persistent feeling of 
being too fat. Such feelings may 
give rise to rigorous efforts to 
further control the weight, like 
developing unique or unusual 
habits around eating (despite 
actually eating very little), or 
elaborate regimens of exercise and 
activity.
Often this rigorous effort ex
tends to everything the anorexic 
does. The anorexic student may 
expend great amounts of time and 
energy trying to achieve perfec
tion in whatever activity is under
taken.
Bulimia nervosa may also take 
up time, energy, and attention. 
Though they may not appear to 
be underweight in the way ano
rexics do, bulimics may experi
ence similar fears of being over
weight, concerns about thinness, 
and periods of food restriction or 
self-starvation.
What most markedly charac
terizes bulimia, and what differ
entiates it from anorexia, is that 
the bulimic may engage in binge 
eating  consuming large quan
tities of food within a given period 
of time (typically a few minutes to 
a few hours) and then purging  
ridding themselves of all that has 
been consumed, most commonly 
by vomiting, the use of laxatives, 
diuretics, or diet pills. These al
ternating binges and purges may 
occur a few times a week to as 
often as once or several times a 
day.
These behaviors are often expeattention that is paid to the be
haviors.
Depending upon how frequently 
and intensely the binges and 
purges are occurring, they may 
also become an increasing source 
of interference with daily activi
ties. For the student, this might 
mean difficulty with paying 
proper attention to studies and 
other everyday responsibilities, 
like going to class.
It is important to know that if 
you or anyone you know and are 
concerned about are experienc
ing eating-related difficulties, 
help is available on campus. The 
staffs of the Health Center and 
Counseling Center at Carnegie 
Mellon are available for consulta
tion, referral information, or treat
ment.
Alternatively, there are many 
places where help may be obtained 
beyond the Carnegie Mellon 
campus. To find out- what offcampus services are available, call

tional Network for Eating Disor

proclamation of the values by 
which I live my life. I have 
suffered a long time for my 
beliefs. Now its your turn.
Episode One: What I 
Believe
I believe that styrofoam is 
the food of the future. I believe 
that Peter Gabriel and Morton 
Downey Jr. are one and the 
same. I believe that a beer in 
front of me is better than a 
frontal lobotomy. I believe in 
eating raw pork and smoking 
three packs a day. I believe in 
full-contact golf. I believe in 
violating the laws of time and 
space. I believe that solar 
powered gourds can be made 
into a reality within this cen
tury and that it is imperative 
that we channel much more 
research money into this proj
ect. I believe that Bobcat
late can be a hi 
fairly relaxing experience. I be
lieve that Steve Winwoods clip 
for Higher Love was the last 
original concept in music video. I 
believe that Ice Blue Aqua Velva 
and Dekuyper Bluesberry 
Schnapps are the same thing. I 
believe that William Shatners 
toupee should be put in perma
nent exhibit in the Smithsonian 
Institution. I believe that Amway 
secretly rules the world. I believe 
that Bible Pictionary is the root of 
all evil. I believe that Jack 
Nicholson, Shirley MacLaine and 
Arnold Schwarzenneger should 
star in a movie entitled Terms of 
Commando. I believe that a cata
lytic inverter would be a really 
useless gadget. I believe that 
Margaret Thatcher would make 
a fine President of the United 
States and Ronald Reagan would 
make a stupendous Queen of Eng
land. I believe that taking my 
shirts off their hangers before I 
wear them will remedy my back 
problem. I believe that legalizing 
dynamite is a viable solution to 
this rampant, socially debilitat
ing problem. I believe that some
one should knock out all of Brian 
Bosworths teeth really soon. I 
believe that am the only person 
alive who believes that Leon Uris 
is a part of the digestive tract. I 
believe that all of the worlds 
excess garbage should be stored 
in Rosemary Clooney.
Episode Two: What I Dont 
Believe
I dont believe that cellulite is 
the window to the soul. I dont
believe in polygamy, monogamy, 
celibacy, homosexuality, hetero
sexuality or asexuality. I dont 
believe in acquired tastes; I mean, 
death could become an acquired 
taste if you try it often enough. I 
dont believe that Ethel Merman 
hoaxed her own death in order to 
get away from the trap of her 
fame. I dont believe that girl I 
asked out last year is going to

Help create the 
first 21st century company.
Apple has always been a little ahead of its time. From 
the introduction of the first popular personal computer, 
to the first system to use graphic user interface, to the 
first desktop publishing system, our goal has always been 
the same: to change the world with computers.
That goal results in a company that is every bit as advanced as its products. In many ways, Apple is well 
on its way to becoming the first 21st century company 
in the Fortune 200.
Where the typical company emphasizes hierarchy, 
at Apple we stress networks. Instead of mandates coming 
down from the top, ideas percolate throughout the organi
zation. We give our people unusual amounts of responsi
bility. Extraordinary tools to let them do their best work. 
And an eclectic environment conducive to changing the 
world.
Add to that unusual environment all of the 
resources a major corporation can provide. Sophisticated 
management. Astute marketing. International distribution. 
And you have the elements of the first company of the next century: Apple.
If youre ready to lead the way beyond the year 
2000, and youre about to receive a degree in engineering 
or computer science, why not join a company as eager 
to see what you can do as you areApple.
Come hear our engineers and MIS managers 
talk about our future and your future with us.9

from there to the steam tunnels.
' The door was securely locked. Our 
investigation of the E and F level

ful. The night was not going well.
Still, there were many more 
tunnels to be conquered, and our 
 contact had warned us that the 
 western tunnels were locked and 
" alarmed. Our next objective, the
1 Doherty tunnel, was sup- _______

we decided it must have been the 
former. They left almost immedi
ately after seeing us, so soon we 
had the entire hall to ourselves. 
At last, to work.
There was a row of about six
wires, as well as numerous con
trols. Physical Plant had obvi
ously been using the tunnel fairly 
frequently, as we noted a number 
of log books, notations, and hand 
equipment. The tunnel was cov
ered in a thick layer of grime and
Returning to the main tunnel, 
we soon came to another unex
pected intersection, this time a 
ladder leading up into the ceiling. 
At the top of the ladder we found 
a room, complete with chairs, old 
wine bottles, and a few Academic
dust, and we noticed a number of Services coffee cups. Half of the
roaches. It certainly was not the 
spectacular conduit that we had 
imagined.
After taking pictures, we de

efforts to find the largest tunnel, 
which according to our maps 
spanned the campus from the gym 
to the Wean Robotics lab. After 
ruling out all obvious possibili
ties, we settled on a single locked 
door just past the fourth floor of 
doors leading into the mall-side of. Wean Hall. This door was locked,
the Doherty wall. Two were 
locked, and the rest were closets. 
Stefan, being a New Yorker and 
hence familiar with minor crime, 
managed to pick the padlock to 
the first door, which unfortunately 
contained nothing but bricks. 
Opening the second door was 
beyond our ability, and we pre
pared to leave. It was at this
and had we been rational 
would surely have left.
Well, lets just say that I now 
possess three hinge pins. Still, 
even without hinges, friction and 
the deadbolt kept the door in place. 
Discouraged, and with a bit more 
respect for security, we resolved 
to try a less secure entrance.
We stopped to grab a bite at the
moment that Marc, in a fit of Tartan Grill. Keeping with the
divine inspiration, decided to 
examine the small ledge above 
the door.
Above the door was a hole, about 
two feet by one foot, leading into a

stairwell. We clambered onto the 
ledge and lowered ourselves into 
the abyss. Descending the stairs 
we at last found ourselves in, 
amazingly enough, a steam tun
nel. The first thing that we no
ticed was that the tunnel was 
extremely well lit. We could see 
from one end of Doherty to the 
other. The walls were covered with 
graffiti dating back to the early 
seventies.
The tunnel itself was about 
eight feet high and ten feet wide, 
varying at places depending on 
the amount of equipment. On the 
side walls and the ceiling were 
numerous pipes and electrical
spirit of our adventure, we ne
glected to pay. From there we 
ventured on to Margaret Morri
son. We wandered around the 
childrens school for a short time, 
but feeling guilty we decided to 
look elsewhere. Another flight 
down, next to a ROTC storage 
room, was the open entrance to a 
physical plant room. Warily eye
ing the large number of ROTC 
students next door, we entered 
the room. Inside was another door, 
which opened into the intra
campus subway. This, judging 
by the prodigious amount of wall 
scrawlings, is by far the most 
popular tunnel on campus. The 
tunnel stretched out of sight, to 
the west and south.
We walked west about thirty 
yards, and came to another inter
section. We turned off and found 
ourselves under CFA. We heard 
voices above us and had to keep 
silent. Coming to the other end of 
CFA, we found another entrance 
under the rear CFA steps from 
where we could watch people 
passing by. There was an exten
sion to our tunnel that led to a 
door in GSIA.
room was filled with dirt and the 
other half was cement. The graf
fiti on the walls convinced us that 
WRCT and at least two fraterni
ties had used it numerous times. 
_______ Returning to the tun
nel, we encountered a 
searing blast of intense 
heat. Yes, they call them 
STEAM tunnels for a 
reason. The temperature 
could not have been a 
degree below 120, and we 
had worn heavy clothing, 
gjjg We sweated through this 
section until we came to 
the exhaust fan. Ducking under
neath the huge fans, we came to 
the Doherty exit. We examined 
the door we had molested and an
other one with the words Rat 
Patrol inscribed on it.
We had yet to encounter a single 
alarm, which was both reassur
ing and frightening. Surely the 
alarms would be near the Robot
ics Institute. Dont worry. Wher
ever theres graffiti, we know 
people have been before, Marc 
said, just as we noticed the lack of 
graffiti on the walls. Still, there 
werent any claxons, no mounted 
police, no tear gas.
We pressed on. The final exit, 
leading into the Robotics Insti
tute, had a sign on it: THIS DOOR 
ON SECURITY ALARM. OPEN 
ONLY IN CASE OF EMER
GENCY. Definitely not some
thing to mess with. As I said to 
Stefan, I think its time to take 
this sign for what it says.
We started back toward 
Doherty. After several moments 
we heard a soft electronic noise, 
bleep beep beep, much like the 
sounds produced by the world 
destruction devices in James Bond 
movies.
Deciding that flight was the 
better part of valor, we ran (as 
best as one can with a full set of 
tools) back to the first fork. Figur
ing that the Doherty entrance was 
the most obvious, we took the 
tunnel under the gym. At the top 
of a single flight of stairs, was a 
door slightly cracked open. We 
peered through the crack for sev
eral moments before fright forced 
us forward. We found ourselves 
in the gym laundry room. (No, we 
didnt know the gym had a laun
dry room either!) From there it 
was a simple matter to find an 
exit. Our survey of the steam 
tunnels was complete.
What is hamburger? Chopped ham?
f?
Hamburger is the standard 
cheap easy food. Nothing to eat 
in the house? Can't think of 
what to make? Throw a burger 
ortwo on the grill. And of course, 
Cybill Shepherd wouldnt trust
a person who didnt like the 
raw sensuality of a hamburger.
To get meat to hold together 
for meatballs or meatloaf, crack 
a raw egg into the meat and 
knead it through. You can 
stretch the meat by crumbling 
a slice or two of bread and 
kneading that in as well. Knead 
seasonings in with the egg or 
bread (chopped garlic or onion, 
basil, cumin) and shape as 
desired.
Meatballs
After following the above direc
tions, brown the meatballs, stir
ring often but gently, in an un
greased skillet or frying pan to 
cook thoroughly and remove ex
cess oil.
Meatloaf
Combine two pounds ground 
beef, one egg, one crumbled slice 
of bread, and two cloves of garlic. 
Knead well and bake at 300 de
grees in a loaf pan until cooked 
through (about twenty minutes). 
For a fancier touch, you might 
want to hide raw carrots, small 
cooked potatoes, or peeled hardboiled eggs in the meat. When 
you slice the meatloaf, the car
rots, potatoes, or eggs will act as 
edible decorations.
Chili
Cook two pounds ground beef in 
a skillet until the meat is thor
oughly browned. Pour any grease 
off and discard. Add two medium 
diced onions and three cloves of 
garlic and cook over medium heat, 
stirring occasionally until the on
ions become transparent. Re
duce heat and add tomato sauce 
or salsa, as desired, and one can 
of red pinto beans.
Season to taste with chili 
powder and cumin. Let simmer. 
Serve over rice.
Eggplant or Zucchini
Brown one pound groundbeef 
in a skillet and remove grease. 
Add diced onions and cook, stir
ring occasionally, until the on
ions are transparent. While this 
is cooking, halve one eggplant 
or two zucchini lengthwise and 
scoop out seeds, creating hol
low vegetables.
Fill the hollows with the meat 
mixture. Top with grated 
cheese, wrap in aluminum foil, 
and bake at 350 degrees until 
vegetables are tender.
Carrots are an excellent side 
vegetable, especially in an or
ange sauce. Peel carrots and 
slice thinly (quarter-inch slices). 
Cook the slices in orange juice 
concentrate and enough honey 
to sweeten it to your taste, until 
the carrots are tender.

Field hockey avenges loss
By SHAFI KAHN
Tartan Staffwriter
It was a re-match of sorts against Bethany last 
Monday. Last year, the Lady Bisons.handed CMU 
a heartbreaking 1-0 loss which cost them the 
Presidents Athletic Conference title. There were 
only eight returning players (four, on each side), 
but these two teams always hook a very physical 
and emotional contest.
In an active and fast paced game, the Lady 
Tartans took revenge on Bethany, 1-0, on their 
home field at Chatham College.
It was a defensive battle that saw good drives 
broken up in the first half. Carnegie Mellon put 
tremendous pressure on Bethany in the second
half but failed to score on numerous opportunities.
On one deep drive, Luisa Pessoa-Brandao hit a 
shot that was nicely deflected by the Bethany goalie. 
CMUs Sue Moll had a couple of shots that beat the 
goalie, but they went wide left of the net.
With 10 minutes left in the game, the Tartans took 
a penalty shot. Sue Moll drove a chest high line drive 
to the left of the goalie. Bethanys goalie got her stick 
on the ball, but its speed kept it going into the net.
The Lady Tartans lost to Hiram this past Satur
day. The team played hard but was no match against 
the more experienced Lady Terriers, and lost, 5-1. 
Scoring for CMU was Merry Willis.
The Lady Tartans continue their season with two 
away games; W&J on September 28 and Juniata on 
October 1.

Rowing Club successful at the Head of the Ohio
The State of 
the Athlete
The idea of the student ath
lete at Carnegie Mellon varies 
greatly from big schools like 
SMU or Pitt.I
 At a luncheon last Thursday 
in the Faculty Dining Room, 
Head Football Coach Rich 
Lackner helped clarify this 
distinction.
I A student at CMU is given no 
incentives to play varsity 
sports. Lackner commented,
The Admissions Department is 
very strict with us. While the 
coaches are able to go out and 
recruit athletes, those prospec
tive players must qualify as 
students to be admitted to the 
university FIRST. They cannot 
Offer those students scholar
ships or any financial induce
ment to come play here, unlike 
the larger Division I schools 
around the tri-state area.
Our team plays for the sheer 
^enjoyment of the sport, said 
Lackner. This would seem to be 
$he first criterion in being an 
, athlete anywhere. The coach, 
speaking from his own experi
ence as an athlete at Carnegie 
Mellon, cited some other impor
tant elements. These included 
discipline and a willingness to 
make sacrifices. Being on a 
team leaves little or no time for 
being an R.A., being in a fraterlity, or writing for the Tartan 
newspaper.
Athletes are not given special 
privileges in the classroom 
either. In fact, class commit
ments are what is hurting the 
team almost as much as injuries 
his season. When asked by the 
administration what they could 
do to help the program, Coach 
teich Erdelyi responded by 
asking teachers to refrain from 
scheduling classes and study 
sessions from 4:30 to 6:30 pm, 
time which is classified as 
University Free Time.
It is difficult to practice, 
added Lackner, when your 
.quarterback or half of your 
defensive backs are in class. Its 
lifferent for swimming or 
track...they can still practice if 
some of their team is busy; we 
cant.
One of the more amusing com
ments made was Lackners: A 
smart young man is not always 
football smart. While an 
athlete may have a 4.0 average 
in the classroom, he still may be 
missing an assignment in the 
backfield because he does not do 
his homework.
Its not good enough in the 
classroom to get a C  its not 
;ood enough on the football field 
to go 5-5, Lackner said about 
performance.
At almost any other school, a 
football or basketball player is 
Qn,athlete who goes to classes. 
Here, one is a student (and a 
>ood one), who happens to like 
)laying varsity sports.
Because of this, there is great 
Pressure on the student athlete 
to perform well in the classom and on the field. Every 
Week, he is representing himhis team and his school on 
(he athletic field. This is both 
honor and a challenge. Even 
the teams are not victorious, 
athletes are still very deserving 
.of appreciation for making the 
tffort.
; Coach Lackner summed up 
*8 remarks with a very fitting 
*nd inspiring comment, We 
hpe that the student athlete 
[here at CMU] is the type of 
individual this campus wants 
and can be proud of.

Robert Patterson (22) leaps over Bethanys Kurt Coster during Saturdays game at Bethany. The 
Tartans gained more that 350 yards on the ground on the way to a 42-16 victory.
By STEWART LEVINE
Tartan Contributing Editor
BETHANY, WV - The only 
tough thing about Saturdays 
game against the Bisons was 
supposed to be the bus ride there. 
But for a while, Bethany (1-2,0-1 
Presidents Athletic Conference) 
gave Carnegie Mellon (4-0, 1-0 
PAC) a scare. In the end, the 
Tartans rolled to a 42-16 victory.
The Tartans again won on the 
legs of their running backs, most 
notably senior fullback Chris 
Hansen and sophomore halfback 
Scott Barnyak. Hansen, last 
weeks WRCT, PAC, and UAA 
Player of the Game, led the team 
with 134 yards and two touch
downs. Barnyak, this weeks 
WRCT Player of the Game, had 
124 yards and two touchdowns of 
his own. Quarterback/punter 
Laszlo Buda credited the offen
sive- line for the teams perform
ance rushing. The line was doing 
a hell of job, complimented the 
senior.
The Tartan backfield is rapidly 
growing crowded, an embarrass
ing problem more apparent with 
the return of halfback Robert 
Schmidt. Most of the runners 
seem pleased with.the arrange
ment. Im happy, revealed Bamyak. The other people will have 
roles when [defenses] look for me 
and Chris.
The defense again held the 
opposition to two touchdowns, 
forcing two third-quarter turn
overs after the Bisons had climbed 
back into the game. Defensive 
Coordinator Terry Bodnar admit
ted, We had some breakdowns, 
but we played well.
The Tartans received one more 
bit of good news during the week. 
In the first NCAA South Region 
poll, Carnegie Mellon weighed in 
second in the region behind Ferrum College of Virginia. The top 
four teams in each of the NCAA 
Div. Ill regions will go to the
playoffs at the end of the season
From the start, the game was i 
romp. The first four CMU driver 
equalled four CMU touchdowns 
The Tartans owed their first tw< 
touchdown opportunities to the 
Bisons. After their first drive 
stalled, Carnegie Mellon set up te 
punt. However, Bethany waf 
called for an illegal participatior 
penalty and CMU had a seconc 
chance.
The team went back to typica 
Tartan football; Hansen, Roberl 
Schmidt, and Barnyak carriec 
the ball down field. Barnyak rar 
the ball in from the four to pul 
Carnegie Mellon on top, 7-0.
The Bisons had more problem* 
on the next kick. Punter Scot 
Hunt fumbled the snap and the 
Tartans were in business at the 
Bethany 20. Three plays later 
Hansen had his first touchdowr 
of the afternoon, and CMU had  
14-0 lead.
After a Bethany field goal 
Schmidt fielded the kickoff anc 
returned the ball 28 yards to the 
CMU 45. The Tartans were baci 
in business. The ground game 
continued to do its work behinc 
the offensive line driving the bal 
nine consecutive times down field 
Hansens second touchdown rur 
made the score 21-3.
CMU was not done yet. Aftei 
three more Bethany plays anc 
punt, Buda handed the ball tc 
Barnyak who broke tackles or. 
the left sideline to go 63 yards for 
the fourth Tartan score. At thal 
point, the Bisons had four firsl 
downs.
Bethany entered the game or 
their next play. Bison quarter
back Jamie Hamm saw George 
Terry open, and heaved the bal. 
sixty yards for the completion 
Terry ran the ball the final twentj 
yards into the end zone to cut the 
lead to 28-10.

Overcast skies did not dampen 
anyones enthusiasm for the Sec
ond Annual Head of the Ohio 
Regatta, held at Point Park last 
Saturday.
Spectators and teammates lined 
the banks cheering the rowers on 
to victory along the 21/2 mile race 
course. The University Rowing 
Club from Carnegie Mellon made 
its debut in this national event, 
competing with oarsmen who 
came from as far as Rhode Island 
and New York.
Against first rate competition 
from schools like Notre Dame (this 
years overall winner), Colgate 
and Villanova, CMU came away 
with two medals using their four 
person, sweep style boat.
Since they do not have any other 
boats (such as sculls or two or 
eight person sweep boats), fours 
was the only type of racing in 
which the team could compete.
In the Club category, where the 
boats are not affiliated with a uni
versity, CMU came in third. 
Rowing in that boat were Carrie 
Tedori, Denise Visconti, Marta
Fuentealba and Liz Gross. The 
coxswain for the team was MariaCole.
In the Mens Open Category 
which is for Varsity boats, Carne
gie Mellon took another third 
place medal. The four man team 
was comprised of Mike Mills, 
Glenn Pascewicz, Thomas Hoeffel and URC President Harry 
Printz. The cox was Joyce Alba.
The URC is coached by Liz 
Winter who comes to Carnegie 
Mellon from Oxford University 
where she was captain of Crew.
The club is in its second year at 
CMU. President Harry Printz is 
excited about the progress of the 
Clubs teams. He sees last 
weekends Regatta as being a very 
positive experience. They had fun 
racing against national crews, 
seeing how an established team 
does it, and the event helped to 
build a lot of team spirit.
The Head of the Ohio is co
sponsored by the Mercy Hospital 
Foundation and the Three Rivers 
Rowing Club. The proceeds go to 
benefit the Mercy Hospital burn 
center. This is a growing event 
which drew twice as many rowers 
this Saturday as it did last year.

#1 doubles shines, but...
Tennis team bounced 
by Pitt and Grove City
By MELIZA YUMANG
Tartan Staffwriter
After a tough 2-7 loss to Pitt last Monday, the Carnegie Mel
lon Womens tennis team put up a tough fight before losing 4-
5 to their biggest rival, Grove City College, last Wednesday. 
However, the week was not a total loss. CMUs #1 doubles team, 
Suzy Dottor and Beth Cavanaugh, were very successful, win
ning both of their matches.
The Lady Tartans had an especially tough time in the singles 
matches, losing all but two in straight sets. Number one player 
Suzy Dottor won the first set 6-3 before losing 0-6, 3-6; #2 Beth 
Cavanaugh lost 2-6,1-6; #3 Mary Beth Ashbaugh lost 1-6, 0-6; 
#4 Alice Garber lost in three sets 2-6,6-3,4-6; #5 Tracy Boyd lost 
2-6, 2-6; and #6 Sohee Chung lost 2-6, 3-6.
Pitts doubles teams were not tough enough to outplay the 
Lady Tartans. Dottor and Cavanaugh (#1 doubles) won their 
match with a tiebreaker, 6-4, 7-6 (7-2). The #2 team of Ash
baugh and Garber also won, 7-6, 6-2. Unfortunately, the #3 
doubles of Boyd and Jenny Bourque put up a struggle but lost 
a tough match, 4-6, 4-6.
The rivalry against Grove City was much more exciting as the 
teams played under gray skies in very chilly, windy weather. 
Despite the bad weather, CMU played well so as not to let their 
guests run away with an easy win.
Both teams walked away, even after the singles matches, 
with three apiece. Second seeded Cavanaugh won 6-1, 7-5; #4 
Garber won a close match with a 7-3 tiebreaker in the first set; 
and #5 Chung won her match easily after a tough first set, 6-4, 
6-1.
The first set was pretty close. It was a psychological game for 
.my opponent. After the first set she just lost it,  Chung said 
after her win.
The day was a big disappointment for the other singles 
players, all of whom lost in very close matches. Number one 
Dottor lost 4-6, 2-6 and #3 Ashbaugh lost 4-6,4-6. Maya Stein
berg took her opponent to three sets and a tiebreaker before 
losing 6-3, 6-7 (9-7), 2-6.
With the score three all, the doubles teams played under a lot 
more pressure. The #2 team of Ashbaugh and Garber suffered 
a tough match. They lost the first set in a tiebreaker and then 
bounced back to win the second fairly easily, 6-2, before losing 
a close third set, 5-7.
The #3 team, Boyd and Sternberg also lost a difficult match, 
2-6, 2-6.
The big win of the day came from #1 doubles team, Dottor and 
Cavanaugh. The two fought off some vicious volleys from the 
Grove City pair, including those of the towering 6-foot player.
The Lady Tartans won a narrow first set with a tiebreaker, 7-
6 (9-7). In the second set, Grove City was up 1-4. Dottor and Ca
vanaugh had no intention of letting up. Cavanaugh commented 
afterwards, We were just taking it easy in the beginning of the 
.second set. Then we just started playing smarter. She began 
producing some great baseline work, deep lobs and surprising 
down-the-line winners.
Dottor volleyed extremely well, even after her disappointing 
singles loss. She returned a winning volley at her feet on the 
break point that evened them up 4-4 in the second set. Finally, 
the teams made it to match point with all four players at the net. 
Cavanaugh and Dottor prevailed and won the second set, 7-5 
and thus the match.
CMUs 4-5 loss to their Grove City rivals was a success in 
some ways for the team. They still remain in good shape for the 
season and are even more anxious to meet their rivals again at 
the PAC tournament at the end of the season.
For the past two years, the finals of the tournament havebeen 
between Grove City and CMU, with the Tartans winning in
1986 and Grove City in 1987. Lady Tartan Beth Cavanaugh 
best expresses the teams resiliency, We can still get them at 
PACs!
Fans can be proud of 88 Bucs
By BRIAN DEAN
Tartan Staffwriter
This past weekend, the Pirates 
entered their last homestand at 
Three Rivers Stadium in second 
place, 12 games back of the Na
tional League East leading New 
York Mets. The second place Pi
rates, with 82 wins and 69 losses, 
certainly completed a rite-of-passage this season that revealed 
character and a solid young club 
with a bright future.
Many skeptical fans around 
baseball, and even here on this 
campus have criticized the Pirates 
for not having what it takes to be 
a contender. Many Mets1 
fans here at CMU 
have said that 
the Bucs never, 
really threat
ened New 
York and
even 
in first 
place, ex
cept for a 
few days in the 
first month of the 
season. Granted, 
pennant winner is not 
what the Pirates are right 
now; they are a team that has 
literally rebuilt themselves fromN 
the ground up in the past three 
years.
The Bucs management has 
shed its chronic last-place image 
by firing or releasing many over
paid, unproductive big-name play
ers, and by ridding the organiza
tion of many players who were 
involved with drugs.
With a 1988 starting lineup of 
several young players, many of
whom were in their rookie sea
son, the Pirates showed the league 
a young team that would consis
tently play hard, chasing the New 
York Mets and first place. The 
Pirates were in first or second 
place for all but two days of the 
season. The Mets would often 
sweat it out as the Pirates consis
tently chased them to one half 
game behind first place after the 
Bucs beat the Los Angeles Dodg
ers on July 21.
But, even though the Pirates 
will not make it to the playoffs, 
they built themselves into a solid 
future contender. In an effort to 
strengthen the young club, the 
Pirates acquired several vet
erans in mid-seaSon. 
Among them were 
infielder Ken 
Oberkfel, who 
backs up 
Bobby 
Bonilla 
a t 
third 
and 23 
year old 
second base
man Jose Lind. 
Also acquired were 
Gary Redus, of exPhillies fame, and Glenn 
Wilson from Seattle. Both 
players would serve as platooning outfielders, and add ex
tra power off the bench for pinchhitting duties. Also, veteran 
pitcher Dave LaPoint, in his first 
three starts as a Pirate, went 3-0 
with a 0.42 ERA.
The Pirates regular lineup has 
produced three players who have 
been consistently in the top ten in 
National League hitting. 
Leftfielder Barry Bonds fre
quently led the league in runs
scored and is presently third, with 
96. Centerfielder Andy Van Slyke 
holds the fifth spot for runs batted 
in with 96, and leads the league in 
triples with 15. All-Star third base
man Bobby Bonilla, who during 
the first two-thirds of the season 
had been consistently near the top 
in home runs and RBIs, has unfor
tunately cooled off.
Overall, there is a great deal of 
talent in the Pirates that has 
shined through, and yet, much still 
needs to be polished. The pitching 
had suffered some lapses during 
August and September, which is 
one reason for the fall in the stand
ings. Specifically, Mike Dunne, 
who finished 1987 with a 13-6 
record, and a 3.03 ERA and was 
subsequently named THE SPORT
ING NEWS 1987 N.L. Rookie 
Pitcher of the Year, went through 
many ups-and-downs this season.
At times, Dunne pitched won
derfully, titillating hitters with an 
awesome split fingered fastball; 
other times, Dunne would think 
too much about what he was doing 
on the mound, and fail to find the 
strike zone. He is presently 7-11 
with a 3.93 ERA.
At 25 years old, Mike Dunne 
seems to be a key in the Pirates 
future pennant hopes. Other start
ing Pitchers such as 1988 All-Star 
Bob Walk, and the young, hard 
throwing John Smiley will need to 
be more consistent in the second 
half of the season to keep the Pi
rates within striking distance.
Bobby Bonilla is also a key for a 
future winning season. Bonilla, at 
25 years old, is in his second sea
son with the Pirates, third in the 
Majors. At the All-Star break, 
Bonilla was hitting .303 with 17 
Homers and 59 RBI  which 
earned him the starting spot at
third base in the 1988 All-Star 
Game. Bonilla has tapered! off 
recently, and is hitting a much 
deflated .270, with 23 HR and 93 
RBIs as of last week.
Many of the Bucs everyday 
players, such as Bonilla andVai 
Slyke, have suffered bum-out 
from such a demanding schedule. Many of the starters Have 
never had such a grueling re>* 
sponsibility placed upon them. 
However the team needs suchi 
pressures in order to mature and 
play the roles of Major Leaguers 
who can endure 162 games,
Even though finishing in 
ond place, the hard work andhononsense style of Manager Jimi 
Leyland has paid off for the Pj. 
rates. The team has drawn the 
largest home attendance figure 
in the history of the organiza
tion. As of last Saturday, the 
Bucs have drawn 1,788,415 fans, 
which surpasses the record of 
1960  when the Pirates Won 
the World Series.
Leylands determination lias 
also paid off for himself. This 
past Friday, he was signed by! 
the Pirates for a two year guar
anteed contract worth $250,000! 
a year. Obviously his tooth-andnail efforts to turn this ball club 
around and provide the people of 
Pittsburgh with a contender are 
certainly appreciated.
In the years to come, we should 
not expect a World Champion 
right away. There is still -the 
growing and maturation phase 
which must be completed. How
ever, in 1989, look for a Pitts
burgh baseball team that will 
provide yet even more excite
ment and contention for the 
coveted first place, which has 
been monopolized for far too lqng.
Lack of pitching is a factor...
Tartan baseball continues rocky season
By JUDY GROSSMAN
Tartan Staffwriter
Hard times have fallen upon 
Carnegie Mellons Baseball Club. 
The Tartans took a 1-1 record into 
last weeks action, but were un
able to maintain their .500 rec
ord.
Tuesday afternoon, the Tartans 
took on Steubenville and suffered 
their second loss of the season. 
CMU managed just one run in the 
contest, but Steubenville crushed 
Tartan pitchers for 11 runs, seven 
of those off of sophomore pitcher 
Chris Rabold.
The Tartans hurt themselves 
with errors, committing five in 
the first inning alone. This put
pressure on pitcher Rabold and 
reliever Mike Stein, who took over 
in the seventh inning.
Were going to have to cut down 
on our mental mistakes, said 
Rabold. We have to get more 
runners on base and create more 
scoring opportunities if we hope 
to win.
You cant expect two pitchers 
(Rabold and Rick France) to carry 
you through a season, added Club 
President and first baseman Perry 
Pierce. We havent had the of
fense or defense to back our pitch
ers up. Pierce committed three 
errors total, two of those in the 
first inning.
On Thursday, the Tartans were 
crushed by Waynesburg 17-1.
CMU was again unable to gener
ate offense, managing just three 
total hits. Their only run came late 
in the game. Third baseman Mike 
McGuire doubled and became the 
first Tartan to get on base since 
Roy Whites walk in the third in
ning. Two batters latter, Phil 
Tubesing singled to score McGuire.
Tuesday we didnt have de
fense, said Pierce. Thursday we 
had no offense and our defense fell 
apart after the third inning.
The Tartans had both offense 
and defense on Saturday when they 
hosted Steubenville at Mellon 
Park, in a re-match of Tuesdays 
game. This time it was the Tartans 
who came up winners, 16-2. Rabold 
pitched a complete game and the
Tartans made few, if any, men
tal mistakes.
We took advantage of 
Steubenvilles mistakes, said; 
Rabold. Their pitcher walked 
couple of hitters and we were 
able to generate some clutch 
hitting. We managed to cut down 
tremendously on our mistakes, 
and everyone contributed to the 
win.
The team took this 2-3 record 
to Boyce Community College on 
Sunday. Yesterday, the Tartans 
hosted Duquesne and faced some 
of the toughest pitching of any 
school in the area.
The Tartans will host Penn 
State-New Kensington tomorrow 
at Mellon Park beginning at 2:30.

Slippery Rock Invitational Meet
mOT IOpOod salu n oTI nn
By LEN ONEAL
Tartan Staffwriter
Facing a field of Division I & II schools for the 
second weekend in a row had little effect on the 
Carnegie Mellon Mens Cross Country Team. The 
Tartans placed five runners in the top 10 and went 
on to win the Slippery Rock University (of PA) In
vitational. Finishing in the top three for teams 
were Carnegie Mellon 
(30 pts.), Slippery Rock 
(48 pts.), and Ashland 
University (50 pts.).
The Tartans, the only 
Division III school that 
participated in the 
.meet, were led by jun
ior Dave Supp, who 
covered the hilly 5-mile 
course in 27:05, which 
was good for a third 
place finish. The Tar
tans then displayed 
some solid teamwork, as 
their next four runners 
finished within ten sec
onds of each other, sen
ior Pat Noll garnering 
fifth place, junior Gary 
Harrison sixth, junior 
Gary Meeker seventh, 
and junior Len ONeal 
finishing ninth.
Head coach Gary 
Meckley was very opti
mistic of the teams 
chances going into the 
meet, and afterwards 
that optimism turned 
towards the remainder 
of the season. Said 
Meckley, were doing better than last year (a team 
which finished ninth in the country). Supp, Noll, 
Harrison, Meeker, and ONeal all ran very well 
today, and I still think we can get better with the 
depth we have this year.
For a coach that has taken a Tartan cross country 
squad to Nationals eleven out of the last twelve 
years, this year appears to be no different. As long 
as we stay healthy, I see no reason for this team not 
to make it to Nationals, stated Meckley.
The Tartan runners will be back home this Sat
urday, facing the team from Hiram College at 11:00 
am on Flagstaff Hill. Carnegie Mellon will be look
ing to extend its NCAA Division III record of 
consecutive dual meet victories to 96 in a row.

At the Slippery Rock Invitational, the Carnegie 
Mellon Womens Cross Country team battled 
through the hills and valleys of the difficult course 
to triumph.
Although defeated by two tough Division II 
schools, Ashland College and Slippery Rock Uni
versity, the Carnegie 
Mellon women finished 
as the first Division III 
School and third over
all.
Teamwise, Ashland 
had a strong showing in 
the meet with a total of 
only 26 points for the 
places of their first five 
runners. Close behind, 
Slippery Rock totalled 
with 46 points and CMU 
followed with 96. 
Duquesne then Thiel 
rounded out the five 
teams.
Slippery Rocks Loraine Sharkey took top 
honors as the first place 
finisher with a time of 
20:06.
Individually, the 
Lady Tartans continue 
to look strong and are 
improving with every 
meet. Kristin Burgard 
finished just out of the 
top 10 in 11th place with 
a clocking of 21:34. Sue 
Johnson and Carolyn 
Lowe came across the 
finish line in 18th and 26th place, respectively. Sue 
Sparks surprised herself by placing 4th for the 
Lady Tartans and 32nd overall.
Tartans Roseanna Neupauer, Francesca Crannell, Lois Raska and Emily Burke all completed the 
5,000 meter course in excellent form.
The womens cross country coach, Dario Donatelli 
feels that the team is strong. The five man differ
ential [the time between the first and fifth man] is 
decreasing with every race. The girls work well 
together as a team.
On Saturday, October 1, the Carnegie Mellon 
team will compete against the Lady Terriers of 
Hiram College at home. The meet will begin on 
Flagstaff Hill in Schenley Park at 11:00 am.

who contributed to a fine CMU finish.

continued from LU
carry Bethany back into the 
game.
The Tartans next posses
sion stalled, capped by the 
centers snap sailing over 
Laszlo Budas head. The Bi
sons recovered at the CMU 
19, and on the next play from 
scrimmage Hamm found 
Troy Cfostain for another 
touchdown strike. Bethany 
missed a two-point conver
sion attempt, and the lead 
was now only 28-16 with 
more than a half to play.
Carnegie Mellon was 
unable to put the game away 
in the third quarter. After 
their first drive was stopped 
by a Mark Mittlehauser 
interception, the Tartans 
tried to put the game out of 
reach. On third and 17, 
Hansen broke through the 
left side for a 49 yard carry. 
But on fourth and one at the 
Bison 5, the senior slipped 
on the wet turf and the Bi
sons averted the death blow.
The Tartans, however* 
took the next opportunity 
given to them. Lineman 
Jason Dowdy recovered a 
fumble at the Bethany 39: 
CMU drove down the field, 
and on the first play of the 
fourth quarter, Buda made 
the score 35-16. Freshman 
Andrew Pizzurro added one 
more score to end the game, 
42-16.
Next Game: The Tartan^ 
have the week off to prepare 
for the Blue Streaks of Johr| 
Carroll. Carroll played last 
years PAC Champ and 
South Region runner-uji 
Saturday and will face Thiel 
College this weekend. The
