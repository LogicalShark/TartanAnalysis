Tuition 
recommendations 
and reasons
By DRUE MILLER
Tartan Staffwriter
On April 4, the Carnegie Mellon tuition com
mittee released its final report. The committee 
recommended that tuition for the 87-88 year 
be set at $11,100, an increase of 8.3% over 
the 86-87 tuition of $10,250. The proposed in
crease was based on the impact of the GrammRudman Act, as well as projected inflation rates 
over the next two years.
Gramm-Rudman calls for a 30 - 50% reduc
tion of federal-sponsored financial aid and 
research funding by 1987. Earle Swank, com
mittee chairman, explained that Carnegie 
Mellon is protecting itself against any drastic 
cuts; with the 8.3% increase, financial aid 
(which accounts for about 16% of tuition 
revenue) will still be available to all eligible 
students.
Projected inflationary rates for 1987 are 
around 7%. However, Swank anticipates even 
higher rates, having watched the stock markets 
recently. He also sees the possibility of infla
tion soaring as a result of current international 
affairs. Historically, inflation has gone up 
dramatically during wartime, and Swank sees 
I a very real risk of greater military involvement 
I under current U.S. policy. Again, Carnegie 
Mellon is protecting itself by havihg an increase 
above inflation.
Two other options were discussed in the com
mittee meetings. The first of these, the High Tui
tion Strategy, calls for a significant increase over 
inflation; tuition would have been raised 
10-12% The committee rejected this because 
it was too high; the percentage of increase has 
1 been decreasing since 83-84s highest increase
I of 18.9%.I -The second alternative, the Low Tuition ApA Prach, was also rejected. LTA called for a 
I 2-4% increase. This was seen as too minimal 
I an increase, involving too much sacrifice in the 
I quality of programs, faculty, facilities and 
H physical improvements. Also, LTA could have 
| risked cuts in available financial aid. More 
students might apply if tuition were lower, but 
Swank sees no evidence that low tuition at
tracts better students. Figures released by ad
missions show both quantity and quality of ap
plicants have increased in recent years, in spite 
of rising costs.
The 8.3% increase is still subject to change, 
however. Swank, committee member Fred 
Rogers, and the three students on the commit
tee will meet with Student Senate tonight to 
discuss the increase, and on May 9th President 
Cyert will ask for recommendations from all 
department deans, faculty leaders, and student 
leaders. Swank anticipates a lot of concern over 
continuing increases, but doesn't foresee serious 
disagreements, primarily because the recom
mendation came out of better understanding 
within the committee: extensive data was 
Prepared and distributed to all committee 
members well in advance of their first meeting, 
and very thorough final reports were released 
* student and faculty leaders last week.

Three ATO brothers burned in buggy fire
By VUAY REDDY
Tartan News Editor
Three Alpha Tau Omega brothers were burn
ed when a fire erupted in their rented truck dur
ing Fridays buggy races. The driver, who was 
in the buggy, escaped injury.
The fire occurred at 12:40 while brothers 
were treating the buggy s wheels with hexane, 
an oily, flammable chemical.
The hexane leaked onto a radio and burst into 
flames and filled the truck with smoke. 
Paramedics were called and arrived at 12:43: 
six minutes later a second paramedic unit 
arrived.
Meanwhile, fraternity brothers pulled the 
buggy out of the truck so they could free the 
driver, Nevenka Bierny. It was at this time that 
the brothers were injured:
Junior James Angelo, age 21, is listed in stable 
condition in Mercy Hospital with burns to the 
legs, face, neck and right arm, covering 10 per
cent of his body.
Graduate Lee Andre is listed in satisfactory con
dition in West Penn Hospital with a burn on 
his right arm.
Senior Frank Lago received a burn on his hand. 
He was treated on the scene and released; he 
declined a ride to the hospital.
Fire extinguishers from Theta Xi and Pika 
were used to put out the fire before the flames, 
which were licking at the bottom of the truck, 
could reach the trucks gas tank. The Fire Mar
shal inspected the safety conditions of the re
maining trucks during Saturdays races.
Student Senate has $92,535 in reserve fund
By LISA MCANANY
Tartan Editor-in-Chief
In an executive session of Student Senate, the 
Funding and Recognition Committee informed 
the Senators that there is a $92,535 sum 
available for use in a reserve fund.
The Senate maintains this reserve fund so that 
it can meet the increasing costs of student ac
tivities without raising the activities fee every 
year. This year, because of the amount of 
money that was allocated to student organiza
tions, Senate accumulated a $22,000 deficit. 
The money to rectify the deficit came out of the 
reserve fund.
The deficit is largely the result of new clubs 
seeking funding from Senate. According to 
Tamal Mukheijee, Chairman of the Senates Fun
ding and Recognition Committee, at least eight 
new clubs asked for funding this semester. 
Mukheijee expects to see a similar increase next 
semester. In the past, when no reserve funds 
were available, Senate was forced to restrict or 
cut funding of existing organizations by as much 
as 10%. Establishing a reserve fund was seen 
as a means of countering these financial 
restrictions.
The decision to keep the reserve fund within 
the confines of Senate was made in order to give 
the Senate an opportunity to consider its options 
with regards to the fund.
During the session, a resolution was introduc
ed requiring the Funding and Recognition Com
mittee to present Senates options in the form 
of a formal proposal by September 15, 1986
for allocating the money. Senators Peter Cohen 
and Todd Giles introduced the resolution. It was 
subsequently passed, with 16 Senators voting 
in favor, none against and one abstaining. We 
will definitely be looking for student input before 
any kind of final decision is made, said Cohen, 
the recently elected Chairman of Student 
Senate. All hearings on the issue will take place 
during the open Senate meetings on Tuesday 
nights, at which all students are welcome.
Student Senate has three basic options for 
allocating the sum: immediately spend it; invest 
it, or maintain the current situation. If the
money is spent immediately, the activities fee 
will have to increase in order to support the 
Senates funding of clubs and organizations. In
vesting the money is the most complex option. 
It would allow the reserve fund to build up even 
more, further postponing the date when the ac
tivities fee must be raised. But investment might 
constrain the Senates ability to make immediate 
allocations. Maintaining the current situation 
would allow Senate to continue over-allocating 
money to clubs requesting funding. Once the 
fund is seriously depleted, the activities fee will 
be raised again.

The F-lll is reported to be recovered by Libyans
There is a report from the Middle East that 
the wreckage of an American warplaneand 
the bodies of its two crewmen lost in the raid 
on Libyahas been found.
Abu Dhabi's government-owned newspaper 
(Al-Ittihad) reports that wreckage of an F-lll 
warplane was recovered from the sea by Libyan 
military personnel with Soviet assistance. The 
report quotes unidentified Libyan sources.
It says the wreckage of the plane was flown 
to Moscow to be examined by Soviet experts, 
the bodies of the two U.S. airmen reportedly 
were taken to Tripoli, the capital of Libya.
The report cant be verified independently. 
Western diplomatic sources in Abu Dhabi 
dismissed it as unreliable, and sources at the 
Pentagon say they dont know anything about it.
Libya is paying $12 million/year to Abu Nidal
A West German newspaper is reporting more 
evidence of a direct Libyan connection to ter
rorism. The paper (Bild Am Sontag) reports 
Libyan leader Moammar Khadafy met with 
known terrorist Abu Nidal last year. And the 
paper says, they agreed that Abu Nidal's group
of terrorists would attack English, American, 
Israeli and Egyptian targets under the supervi
sion of the Libyan secret service. The article 
says British intelligence has found out that Libya 
has been paying 12 million dollars a year to the 
terrorist group.
Libya has a terrorist price list says paper
A West German weekly newspaper {Bild Am Sonntag) says Libya offers blood money for at
tacks on western targets. The publication today 
reports that Libya offers about S400 for a ter
rorist bombing, Si 200 for a machine gunning.
and up to Si2.000 for a suicide attack. The 
paper says the Libyan terrorist price list was 
discovered by Lebanese and Israeli intelligence 
agents.
American & French people support air strike
There is no shortage of American and French 
supporters of the US air strikes in Libya. A 
Newsweek'" magazine survey says nearly twothirds of the French asked approved of the US 
action. In the US, 71 percent of the respondents 
said they supported the raids. Less supportive 
were the British and West Germanswho disap
proved by as much as 75 percent.
Some of that opposition manifested itself in 
protests yesterday. In London, ten thousand 
people turned out for a sit-down protest at the 
US embassy. And near Frankfurt, West Ger
many, some of the fifteen hundred young pro
testers fired signal rockets into a US military 
compound. Nobody was hurt.

Sidra
LIBYA
LIBIAN MILITARY BASES
Contrary to Libyan claims that six U.S. planes 
had been shot down, only one F-lll was lost 
in the raid. Both pilots on board were killed.
The reasons for the raid, given by President 
Reagan and Mr. Schultz, were the pre-empting 
of future possible terrorist activity by Libya and 
retaliation against previous bombings, primari
ly the April 5th attack on a West Berlin 
discotheque, in which a U.S. serviceman was 
killed. Schultzs statement about the attack was 
that we [were] successfully sending the 
message that terrorism is going to pay a cost.
The U.S. raid on Libya has created some 
dissention among the NATO allies of the U.S.,
but despite the harsh words and signs of 
discord, U.S. officials did not complain about 
the European positions. Official!'', the positions 
of the major European powers varied.
Great Britains Prime Minister Margaret That
cher supported the raid and allowed U.S. 
bombers to take off from British airfields. 
However, the British people are less supportive 
and the press feels the raid may destroy a 
friendly allied government. One paper called 
the raid futile, deplorable and almost certain
ly counterproductive. The killing of three 
Britons in Lebanon on April 17th, in retalia
tion of British support of the raid, will increase
the publics opposition.
France and, less obviously Spain, refused to 
allow the U.S. planes from Britain to fly through 
their airspace, subjecting the pilots to more 
fatigue and greater possibilty of mistakes. The 
attack itself was criticized by most Western 
European governments. France stated they were 
more heavily engaged in the fight against ter
rorism . . . than it has ever been, but that they 
did not want to fight it publicly.
The same idea was raised by the government 
of Italy, who attempted to forestall any military 
actions by the U.S. against Libya. The Italian 
Prime Minister called for solidarity between 
states pursuing peaceful aims and respect for 
the laws of the international community.
The reasons for the U.S. raid on Libya and 
the dissension among the Western-powers can 
be traced mainly to the 1950s, when Libya 
gained independence and oil was discovered. 
Both the Italian takeover of Libya in 1911 and 
the Second World War kept Libya embroiled 
in war for decades. These conflicts left Libya 
weak and by the time of its independence in 
1951, its economy was ruined. Of its one 
million inhabitants, 90% were illiterate and only 
about 14 were college graduates. Libyans were 
also embittered by Western influence and 
began turning to the Arab world.
The independent government was led by King 
Idris, the leader of the resistance movement in 
the 1930s and 40s against the Italians. Idris 
had close ties with Britain, who along with the 
U.S., gave Libya critical aid. The government 
(which gave a larger amount of power to pro
vincial governments) was unusually elaborate 
and because of Idriss mistrust of political par
ties, patronage became widespread. With the 
discovery of oil in 1959 and subsequent im
provement in the economy, corruption and the 
regimes pro-Western policies alienated the 
youth. The call for popular rule increased.
On September 1, 1969, an army colonel, 
Qaddafi, and his Free Officer colleagues stag
ed a bloodless coup. The new regime was com
mitted to ending corruption, distributing oil

revenues equitably and changing Libyan foreign 
policy to a non-aligned, anti-imperialist, Arab 
nationalist posture. By the mid-1970s, Qaddafi 
had greatly improved Libyan housing, medical 
care, education and transportation, and was a 
popular leader.
However, some frustration with the regime 
was becoming obvious in the 1970s. Ex
periments with political organization, including 
the creation of a single political party, were un
popular and inadequate. In April, 1973, Qad
dafi began the popular revolution,in which 
he called for the people to seize power and 
establish popular committees. By 1975, 
however, an important division developed in the 
regime, when a coup was attempted and fail
ed. The leaders fled into exile and the ruling 
circles were taken over by Qaddafi loyalists. 
Despite the attempted coup, Qaddafi continued 
his preference for high profile and expensive 
foreign policy.
In 1977, Libyas name was changed to the 
Socialist Peoples Libyan Arab Jamahiriya by 
an elected General Peoples Congress. The term 
jamahiriya means, loosely translated, a state 
without a government, or a peopledom in 
which the system of popular committees, first 
declared in 1973 and expanded upon in Qad
dafis Green Book (which contained his third 
international theory, calling for direct 
democracy and denouncing all forms of profit), 
was firmly established. In 1979, Qaddafi gave 
up his official position to become the Leader 
of the Revolution and guider of the popular 
revolution in Libya.
By the early 1980s, Qaddafis popularity was 
decreasing and opposition groups had 
developed. The originally peaceful reactions to 
opposition of the government became violent, 
including the public execution of civilians and 
the use of terrorism which continues. However, 
Qaddafi kept some support at home because of 
the economic improvements he has brought
Libya at a quick glance
History
For centuries, Libya was ruled over by foreign 
powers, the most recent being the Turks and 
Italians. The Italians invaded in 1911 and 
decreed the name Libya (once used by the 
Greeks) in 1934.
By 1949, the United Nations General 
Assembly declared that Libya should be in
dependent before 1952. Libya gained in
dependence on December 24, 1951. Libyas 
representative to the UN registrations, King 
Idris, ruled the kingdom of Libya until 
September 1969. At this time, a military coup 
created the Libyan Arab Republic, with Col. 
Mammer el Qaddafi as its chief of State. 
Geography
With an area of 680,000 square miles, Libya 
extends along 910 miles of the coast of South 
Africa. Excluding a narrow coastal strip, the 
land is primarily desert.
People
Libya has a population of approximately four 
million, with Tripoli, the capital, holding 1.2 
million of these. Most of these people are Ara
bian and Moslem, although there are a substan
tial number of immigrant workers form Europe 
and the Middle East. Arabic is spoken as the 
official language.
Economy
The discovery of oil in 1959 brought unex
pected wealth and power to Libya. Per capita 
income rose to $1,500 a year. Libyan lenders 
identified with the Arab cause and called for 
the severance of ties with the West. During the 
1970s, foreign workers were expelled from 
Libya.
However, foreigners, including several thou
sand Americans, returned to meet the demand 
for skilled technicians necessary to Libyas oil

almost unlimited financial resources. Despite a 
reduction in oil revenues because of decreas

on his foreign spending. For example, by the 
1980s, he had spent over $12 billion on 
military equipment from the USSR.
Qaddafis foreign policy is based on a radical 
political ideology, influenced by his third inter
national theory. He sees his revolution at home 
and his opposition to the status quo abroad as 
necessarily combined. Qaddafi has stated, the 
Libyan revolution is based on international 
ideology, not a national movement. A general 
opposition to the international system as reac

Qaddafi.

tional system and despite the branding of Libya 
as a terrorist state by the Reagan administra
tion, foreign business sustains the government 
and provides it with funds to continue its foreign 
policy. Some 1000 Americans work in Libya 
and U.S. oil companies and contractors do 
business there, despite a ban on oil imports by 
the U.S. European nations, primarily France 
and Italy, are more dependant on Libyan oil 
and have greater economic interests and in
vestments. Because of this, they have been 
reluctant to follow the U.S. plan to isolate the 
Qaddafi regime.
The past few years have been ones of ten
sion between Libya and the U.S. Along with 
Libyas role in training and supplying terrorists 
such as Abu Nidal, a major point of conflict has
been over Qaddafis so called line of death  
an extension of the internationally recognized 
12-mile limit along Libyas coast. Motivated by 
the installation of Soviet SA-5 missiles in Libya 
and the discovery of a Libyan connection to the 
airport massacres in Vienna and Rome in 
December, 1985, the U.S. placed economic 
sanctions on Libya.
Along with this, military force was considered 
and a plan called Operation Prairie Fire was 
formed. It was intended to challenge Qaddafis 
claim to sovereignty over water 120 miles from 
Libya and consisted of staging naval manuevers 
beyond the line of death. On March 24, U.S. 
ships crossed the line and Libya retaliated 
by firing missiles at the U.S. planes. The U.S. 
then retaliated by firing at the Surt missile base 
and by sinking three Libyan attack boats. In 
response to the U.S. actions against Libya, a 
Libyan-backed terrorist group called the Izzeddin Qassam, a unit of the Arab Revolutionary 
Cell, placed a bomb on a TWA flight to Athens 
on April 2. The bomb exploded, killing four 
Americans, including an 8-month old baby. The 
explosion in West Berlin was also connected to 
the missile attacks, and led to the more exten
sive bombing raid.
Libyas prospects are unclear, but it seems 
definite that there will be an increase in terrorist 
activity in the Middle East, Europe and possibly 
the United States. Just in the few days after the 
raid, a number of retaliatory actions were taken. 
The U.S. declared that they would take each 
new development one step at a time, and would 
not necessarily increase the use of military force. 
The position of the European nations may 
become more opposed to the use of military ac
tion by the U.S. if terrorist attacks increase. 
Many analysts feel Margaret Thatchers support 
of the raid might harm her chances of reelec
tion during the next election, because of discon
tent among the British people. French and 
Italian policy will probably remain as it has been 
because of both nations interests in Libya.

Editorial
Publicity ploy 
has little effect
The refusal of the four of our illustrious alumni to par
ticipate in the Salute to Carnegie yielded them considerable 
nationwide publicity but had no effect whatsoever on the 
outcome of th gala performance at the Civic Arena on 
Saturday, April 19.
Charles Haid, Barbara Bosson, Robert Foxworth, and 
Rene Auberjonois backed out of their commitment to per
form at Carnegie Salutes Carnegie' only 8V2 hours before 
showtime. As unsympathetic to Carnegie Mellons research 
programs as these performers are, we are equally unsym
pathetic to the performers actions.
The statement which these individuals hoped to make 
was indeed full of sound and fury; unfortunately, it 
signified nothing. The actors felt they could not be involved 
in a university with ties to the Department of Defense. But 
what did their failure to perform actually accomplish? The 
only damage done by this profound moral action, was done 
to the students of Carnegie Mellon.
All four of these now prominent figures owe a part of 
their success to the incomparable training that they receiv
ed from the College of Fine Arts. Rather than showing 
their appreciation of the school, they chose to do their best 
to exploit the situation and gain as much publicity 
as possible from an alread highly publicized media 
event.
But the show went on. The talents of the students who 
replaced the professionals more than adequately filled 
in the gaps. There is a proper time and place for moral 
statements of all kinds. 8V2 hours before a commitment 
to your alma mater is not an acceptable time and place. 
As students, we say thanks to the performers who were 
willing to give their time for the improvement of the univer
sity. To Ms. Bosson and Messers. Haid, Auberjonois and 
Foxworth, we say thanks for nothing.
Student involvement: 
the key to 
campus improvement
The students of Carnegie Mellon do a noticeably large 
amount of complaining. Maybe they have a right to. We 
dont have a student union; our athletic facilities are terri
ble; the academic pressure on students and faculty alike 
is enormous. This university has plenty of room for im
provement. Granted.
But are students who will not even take two minutes to 
vote for student government leaders in any position to com
plain about the current conditions? No, they are not.
Only 17% of the students on this campus were respon
sible enough to have a say in the future of student govern
ment. Are the other 83% satisfied with the status quo or 
just too lazy to do anything to alter it?
Unless students begin to recognize Student Senate as 
the influential body it is, the campus will never improve. 
Unless students begin to take an active part in suggesting 
and implementing specific improvements, the campus will 
never improve. Unless students take a few minutes to vote 
or make suggestions to administrators or Senators, the cam
pus will never improve.
Letters:Student disappointed by Union article
Editor:
I was disappointed and insulted by 
Carl Wicherts recent article in The Student Union entided Senate 
Hides $120,000 Surplus. I do not 
know if Carl deliberately 
misrepresented the facts or whether 
he was merely misinformed. Either 
way, the article was highly 
inaccurate.
First of all, the amount in question 
is not $120,000. This is an ac
cumulation of unallocated activity fee 
funds placed in reserve in the past 
few years. These reserve funds
enable Senate to fully fund student 
organizations without creating a 
deficit and without raising the ac
tivities fee. Senate does not have a 
deficit this year because it was able 
to use $22,000 of these reserve 
funds, contrary to Weicherts article.
The most obvious error is the false 
statement that Senators present at 
the session decided to keep silent 
about the surplus for an indefinite 
time period. At the April 8th 
meeting Senate passed a motion re
quiring the Funding and Recognition 
Committee to prepare a proposal by
September 15, 1986 to suggest 
alternative policies for investing or 
allocating the reserve. At this date, 
Senate will release a statement ex
plaining the alternative policies and 
the monetary figures. Student input 
will be sought before any definite de
cision is made. Weichert neglected 
to mention this information.
In view of these facts, I think that 
Carl Weichert and The Student Union owe Student Senate an 
apology for publishing a misleading 
and irresponsible article.

Editor
I have to say that I love the In
quiring Minds column! Youre ab
solutely right, Inquiring Minds dont 
really give a damn! However, after 
reading your column a few weeks 
ago where you asked us to think 
about the meaning of the pipes in 
Gregg Hall, I became interested in 
that strange hall. Its scary when the 
first lecture hall you enter in your 
(so-called) college career is Gregg 
Hall. What is the purpose of these 
pipes? And how the hell does that 
bird get in?? Everyone who manages 
to stay awake during Calc notices the 
square lights near the ceiling. The 
first thing this Inquiring Mind wants 
to know is why they face up?? Sure
the light reflects off the ceiling but 
wouldnt it be more efficient if the 
light was directed downward?? 
Secondly, everyone who has been in 
there since the 1st semester will tell 
you how annoying the light in the 
front on the left is. First of all, it turns 
from orange to blue light and second 
it goes off and on in a regular pat
tern. Now you must be wondering 
how I know it is a regular pattern. 
Well I am prepared to offer proof. 
During Social Influences (not that 
I was bored, just curious) I timed 
that annoying light. The light stayed 
off for an average of about 2V2 
minutes and then went on for about 
P/2 mins. Much to my dismay, the

Student view:
Carnegie Salutes Carnegie provides entertainment for all
By John Friedmann
Carnival was unique this year. There was the 
usual drunken revelry, which is something Car
nival should never be without, but Carnegie 
Salutes Carnegie made it different.
From the student perspective, 
CSC was a strange animal. At first, 
the idea seemed ludicrous. Leave 
| campus during CARNIVAL? To 
gee Andy Williams and Rene 
whateverhislastnameis? When we could be dan
cing on top of U-Hauls or trying to sneak golf 
balls past gophers on the midway? Forget it.
There was also another dissatisfied faction, 
those students who were under a mandate to 
participate. Although a small minority of the
performers, they saw being forced to give up 
precious carnival time as unfair. Some actively 
searched for ways to get out of the show.
But once the tickets were made available, a 
weird thing happened. They went faster than 
prime singles in room draw. Even the usually 
optimistic Public Relations department seem
ed suprised. But werent the tickets free. Sure 
students were picking them up, but no one 
would actually GO. They were just insurance 
against bad weather.
As the magic date approached, messages 
even started appearing from people who need
ed tickets, and were willing to pay for them. This 
small resale market for the good seats was 
another indicator about the popularity of the 
show.
As the curtian rose, most of those seats were 
occupied. There were no-shows, but many may 
have not been phyically able to attend the show 
due to an overabundance of good cheer and 
Iron City. The crowd was also different from 
the usual Arena denziens. Not once did I smell 
someone lighting up a J
Even the last minute walkout by the four 
stars didnt dent the momentum of Carnegie 
Salutes Carnegie. The general student attitude 
after the show seemed to be Who cares? It 
was a great show without them.
And a great show it was. Even the small group 
of Protest Management majors who brought out 
the ever-popular SEI - CMUs Contribution to 
Nuclear War banner (now appearing weekly 
at Warner Hall) couldnt dent the enthusiasm.
Sure the show was a little long. But suprisingly, it was fun. Even 11 consecutive student 
soloists were entertaining. And Jerry Lewis bit 
of schtick was just what was needed to keep the 
students interest.
The most suprising thing about Carnegie 
Salutes Carnegie was its ability to entertain 
everyone, a formula many producers would be 
willing to sacrifice certain integral body parts 
for. I wouldnt run out and buy the cast album, 
but none of the performers put me to sleep.
Some students even came out ahead from the 
show. A suspiciously large number were carry
ing the little goodies reserved for the big 
spenders, and those little champagne bottles 
may have provided the nucleus for several post
show celebrations.
Student conservationist argues for deposit legislation
by Jim R. Mihelcic
In October of the past year, the Pennsylvania 
House Agricultural and Rural Affairs Commit
tee approved H.B. 479 by an overwhelming 
vote of 20 to 2. H.B. 479, the Reusable Con
tainer Act, would require a five-cent deposit on 
all beverage containers sold in 
iPennsylvania. The deposit would 
si then be redeemed when the cony tainer was returned. Supporters of 
' ^aeposxi legislation include environmental, farm, 
sportsmen, and public interest organizations 
from around the state. Nine states currently 
have deposit legislation including New York, 
Michigan, Iowa, Oregon, and some New 
England states.
Litter affects agriculture and tourism, the two 
largest industries in Pennsylvania. Beer and soft 
drink containers comprise 40 to 60 percent of 
litter by volume. The New York State Depart
ment of Transportation has reported an 80 percent decline in container litter on New York 
| state highways during the programs first year. 
Oregon has reported container and total litter 
reductions of 83 and 40 percent respectively,
since enactment of deposit legislation. Other 
states with deposit laws have realized similar 
reductions in litter. The Pennsylvania Farmers 
Association has reported that Pennsylvania 
farmers experience losses of thirty-eight million 
dollars annually in damage to livestock and 
equipment from container litter.
Deposit legislation would not only reduce 
roadside litter, but it would also play an impor
tant role in a comprehensive solid waste 
management plan for Pennsylvania. Implemen
tation of deposit legislation would reduce the 
cost and magnitude of solid waste collection and 
disposal. This is important as Pennsylvania, 
which already handles nine million tons of gar
bage annually, is faced with a rapid depletion 
of landfill space. The Pennsylvania Bureau of 
Solid Waste Management has estimated that 
Pennsylvania taxpayers will save close to twentythree million dollars annually in solid waste 
handling and disposal costs from returnable 
container legislation. Deposit legislation targets 
the fastest growing segment of solid waste, since 
beverage container use is increasing at an an
nual rate of eight percent.

Bottle bill opponents charge that this legisla
tion will result in a loss of jobs in the glass in
dustry. Supporters counter that the introduction 
of plastic and paper is the main factor affecting 
the glass industrys hardships. In all nine states 
which have enacted this form of legislation a 
net increase in jobs has occurred. Michigan and 
New York have realized a net increase of 5000 
jobs in trucking, handling, and recycling in
dustries. Employment opportunities are realiz
ed in unskilled and skilled positions. Considera
tion of the positive effect of cleaner roadsides 
and parks on tourism should increase the ex
pected employment benefits. Benefits to tourism 
are one reason this law is popular in states such 
as Oregon, Vermont, Maine, and New York.
Deposit laws also produce a net reduction in 
energy consumption due to recycling. In states 
with deposit laws close to 100 percent of steel 
and aluminum cans and glass bottles are being 
reused or recycled with great savings of energy 
and natural resources.

aiutes Carnegie
Entertainer Andy Williams sings with the Chamber Choir.Poller
By BRUCE KASREL
Tartan Entertainment Editor
Last weekend at the Civic Arena the long 
awaited entertainment extravaganza that was 
Carnegie Salutes Carnegie took place. With 
everything from the world famous Kilte Band 
to Jerry Lewis, the night proved to be a great 
success. Although there were no fireworks at 
the close due to the weather, there were more 
than enough earlier in the day. Only eight hours 
before the scheduled event, alumni Rene 
Auberjonois, Barbara Bosson, Robert Foxworth, and Charles Haid announced that they 
were dropping out of the event in protest of 
Carnegie Mellons involvement with the Soft
ware Engineering Institute (SEI).
In a press conference in the Fine Arts 
Building, Haid expressed the fours opinions in 
a prepared statement. We are from the 
humanities. Our work is to affirm life through 
our words, our art, our music. We cannot in 
good conscience participate in any way in 
technology that might destroy it. He continues 
to say, We cannot lend our support- directly 
or indirectly- to an institution that accepts fun
ding from the Department of Defense.
Personally I am outraged at this display of 
unprofessional behavior from what I thought 
were highly professional actors. Luckily they 
were not under any contract so they could get 
away with this. They are performers first and 
foremost, and they were asked to use their 
special gifts to help the university raise money 
it so desperately needs. They all received their 
training here and it was a very high honor and 
a tribute to their achievements to be asked to 
perform. When they decided to drop out they 
not only sacrificed professional standing by 
backing down on a commitment, but also 
disgraced the institution that got them to the 
point that they are now.
On friday, I spoke with Mr. Auberjonois who 
said ...this place is where my career got its 
start, now I have come back to help out. In
stead of helping out the universitys drive to im
prove life on campus, he threw mud in the face 
of Carnegie Mellon. I guess he got all he could 
out of this school so why bother lending a hand 
so others can benefit trOTi this great institution 
(fear of job security, maybe?).
I know that their point is a strong one, bl!* 
as Nancy Marchand and producer Bob Finkel 
(two people who obviously know much more 
about the business) both said during the show
in this business the show must go on. And 
on that note, this article must go on.
The evening began with a parade style en
trance of all those performers in the show. The
members had the crowd tapping their feet in 
enjoyment.
After this highly entertaining act, the show 
took a major detour. Andrew Carnegie himself, 
actually an impersonator of him, got up and 
spoke about whether or not his school fulfilled 
its original purpose. People from the audience, 
who rehersed beforehand, thanked Carnegie for 
such a good education. This proved to be a low 
point of the evening as the whole skit looked 
very staged and forced (it did provide a good 
joke when Carnegie alluded to the fact the he 
resided in Heaven, right buddy). Following 
Carnegie, Dr. Cyert gave us the main reason 
for all this hoopla, we need $200 million dollars 
to spiffy up the place and improve the entire 
universitys academic and social activities. Since 
this event was a fund raiser as well, his message 
came over rather well, but it is still hard to take 
since we fork out a bundle to come here.
The Musical Theatre Dancers provided the 
only dance number of the evening. They were 
perfectly in sync, but the number suffered due 
the virtual absence of solo work. Although the 
news of the drop out had already reached the 
press by show time much of the audience was

parade was your basic T.V. style intro with the 
exception that you could not hear the band at 
all because they were facing away from the au
dience and did little dynamically to compensate 
for this. Next came Andy Williams who you 
could not hear too well either because his 
microphone was turned off. Williams, a true 
professional, resorted to a litde tap dancing to 
please the crowd as Moon River nlaved in 
the background. He finally got his mike to work, 
finished the number, and then went into a 
gospel medley with the Carnegie Mellon Con
cert Choir. The combination was excellent, 
however it did not really showcase the full 
talents of the Concert Choir.
The mood then shifted to a jazz mode with 
the Jazz Choir and Carnegies favorite band 
leader George Gee. The Jazz Choir sang in 
perfect harmony and when they juxtaposed 
Puttin On The Ritz with 42nd Street the 
evening had its first of many high points. George 
Gee and his Make Believe Ballroom Orchestra 
took the audience back a few decades to the 
big band era with a few upbeat selections. His 
constant enthusiasm and the bands talented
not aware of what had transpired. Bob Finkel, 
the shows producer, informed the audience and 
said that they had selected drama students to 
replace them (Anne Capron, Katie Suber, Mar
cus Lovett, Pamela Winslow, Michael Hartson, 
and an Assistant Professor of Acting Anthony 
McKay). These students had very little time to 
rehearse their parts, yet performed more than 
adequately under the circumstances. Worth 
special mention is Michael Hartson, who filled 
in for Charles Haid an in comparison to Haid 
in rehearsal, he did a far better job.
There were many other very fine perfor
mances by students throughout the entire show. 
Vocalists Scott Adler, Lisa J. Klein, Gary S. 
Lindemann, Melissa Standley, Kevin Charbonneau, Maggie Stewart, Shelly Dawson, Guy 
Russo, Linda B. Braun, Lisa Peters all had a 
minute to showcase their talents. All were 
brilliant and there was not a single nervous slip 
among them, although a few were asked to 
stretch their chords a little beyond reasonable 
bounds.
The brightest spot of the whole evening came 
before the student soloists. Recent graduate 
Diane Fratantoni, a former member of touring 
company of Cats, sung the standard song from 
the show Memories and then slipped into a 
roaring rendition of All that Jazz. Her voice 
was full and balanced and it filled the Arena 
beautifully. Coupled with her marvelous stage 
presence she had the audience captivated 
through her entire performance.
The only comedy performance came from in
comparable Jerry Lewis as he took the stage and 
had the audience laughing with his Dumb 
Jokes like What is a wrench... a place for 
jewish cowboys. And with his adaptation of 
Gershwins Rhapsody In Blue which he _ 
called Behold the Fallopian Tube ". Lewis 
again had the crowd laughing as he batded with 
his klutzy drummer who kept dropping his cym
bals. Lewis' gestures were hilarious every time 
the cymbals crashed to the ground.
Despite the lack of the four performers and 
the annoyance of the overstated sales pitches, 
the evening was basically a success. However, 
the true test of its success will come in the next 
few years as Carnegie Mellon tries to reach its 
ambitious 200 million dollar goal.

Harry Anderson brought his one-man-show to 
Pittsburgh. Performing in the main room of the 
Holiday House, Anderson sold out all shows 
with his combination of tricks, cons and jokes.
Anderson went through a few of the acts that 
he has done on Saturday Night Live and also 
some others that have not been seen before on 
television. It was a different kind of humor that 
was appreciated by the crowd which was in no 
way homogeneous. People of all ages were there 
and many expected the tame zaniness of 
Harrys character on Night Court. They were 
surprised as Andersons comic genius explod
ed from the stage.
One of the starting skits was a bit of the old 
slight of hand where he borrows a five dollar 
bill from two different audience members and 
proceeds to tear them in half. He then returns 
a half to each owner and proceeds to rip them 
to pieces, bums them and then magically turns
the pieces to a single ten dollar bill. Finally a 
little bit more is done to the ten and two halves 
of five dollar bills are returned to their owners. 
After an inspection from the lenders, the money 
is proclaimed to be the original bills.
Also included in the nights affairs is the Do 
What I Do con. An audience member is ask
ed to come up with their drink. Harry then asks 
them to do what I do. After various motions 
with the glass, he takes a sip of the drink; so 
does the volunteer. Harry then spits out the sip 
while the volunteer can not since he has already 
swallowed the drink.
One of the more original aspects of Harry 
Andersons repertoire is the chapography. 
Although practiced in Europe for centuries no 
American performs it in an act except Ander
son. Using a wide ring of felt, Anderson makes 
several different types of hats and ends with 
mouse ears and the line Why? Because I like 
it.
The other uniquely Anderson trick was the 
Needle Through the Arm. In this trick Harry 
explains the way of the Geek of the old Carny. 
About the man who would bite the head off live 
chickens and swallow live snakes. He would 
then proceed to pull out long needles from his
carpetbag and proceed to push them through 
his arm, all the while telling the squeemish not 
to worry because it was just a trick.
The evening ended with one last trick called 
the Table Dance. The audience checks the 
table to ensure that there are no hooks or things 
to grab and just a smooth top is found. The 
lights are dimmed, druidish music is played in 
the background and Anderson puts his finger
tips on the table. Slowly he moves his palms 
down flat onto the table and then begins to lift
AP News:
APIt doesnt do much good to have an eight 
millimeter VCR if you dont have movies to play 
on it. And this has not pleased Sonywhich 
makes eight millimeter VCRs. The company 
thinks the world is ready for the litde cassettes, 
which sell for about half the price of VHS and 
Beta tapes. Its problem, though, is that VHS 
and Beta got in big first, and thats what the 
world is watching.
So, to make its eight millimeter players more 
attractive, its been trying to add to its library
the table off the ground with only his palm toucing the table. He then dances around the stage 
proving that there are no strings attached to the 
table. A final spin with the table around his palm 
and the show ends.
An enjoyable evening was had by all. Ander
son had performed for a long time and everyone 
was happily exhausted from laughing and clap
ping. It was definitely something to mark off 
on the calendar and grab some friends to go 
see Harry Anderson the next time hes here.
Diversions
of things to watch. It recendy signed a distribu
tion agreement with Paramount Home Video. 
Under the agreement, says Billboard 
magazine, Paramount may put out 100 pro
grams by the end of the year. Also getting into 
the eight millimeter field is Embassy, which 
signed a deal with Eastman Kodak. Embassy 
is to put out at least 46 titles in the next 18 
months.
A Paramount official says that one plus for 
eight millimeter is that, if it becomes the soft
ware of choice, every maker can use it. This 
would be easier than the current Beta-VHS face 
off.
Expect to find eight millimeter tapes in places 
youd buy the players. Outlets dealing primari
ly in tape, as opposed to tape players, may not 
want to tie up their money in stuff that reaches 
relatively few people.
VIDEO SALES
Like Old Coke, Old Jane Fonda is doing just 
fine in the marketplace. Her original workout 
tape is number five on Billboards weekly na
tionwide survey of sales. However, the new Jane 
Fonda is doing even betterits number one.
Running down the list, its new Jane, follow
ed by Return of the Jedi,, Beverly Hills 
Cop, Pinocchio and Old Jane. 
HOROWITZ HEADS HOME
Pianist Vladimir Horowitz staged a triumphant 
return to his homeland today. He drew a 
thunderous ovation and took six curtain calls 
on the stage of Moscows Tchaikovsky Conser
vatory. It was Horowitzs first performance in 
the Soviet Union in 61 years.
GETTY VS. GETTY
The fabulously rich J. Paul Getty left the bulk 
of his fortune to the Getty Museum in Califor
nia when he died ten years ago. This, although 
he had spent his last years in Britain. His son, 
J. Paul Getty the Second, also has chosen to 
live in Britain rather than his native America.
The son is also worth hundreds of millions 
of dollars. And one of his missions in life is to 
see that the Getty Museum does not make off 
with art works that he feels should stay in Bri
tain. This has made him something of a hero 
in his adopted countrya David fighting 
Goliath. The father and son were, for many 
years, not on speaking terms.
A couple of years ago, the son gave more than 
a half million dollars to the Manchester, 
England art museum to prevent the sale of an 
Italian religious painting to the Getty Museum.
List yssr, he donated 6.3 million dollars to 
the National Gallery in London. It was said to 
be the largest donation to the gallery since its 
founding in 1824.
The British were delighted. For the first time, 
the National Gallery would have the huge 
amounts of money neeucu to keep ari from Deing sent to the U.S. Under British law, an im
portant work cannot be exported until its deter
mined that no local institution c^r, afford to buy 
it.
Britains rt minister, Lord Gowrie, describ
ed the Getty gift as Spledid and'historican 
act of profound generosity. He said Getty had 
put Britain as well as the National Gallery in 
his debt.

hands. Hennings publicist says the performer 
practices finger exercise up to eight hours a day 
to keep his fingers nimble. Henning gained pro

F eaturesThe Inside
By JOSHUA M. LEVINE
Tartan Features Editor
And never, never let them see you 
sweat. If there is anyone really qualified 
to lecture on good sales techniques, its 
got to be IBM, and luckily for us, they 
also realize the value of good PR. Last 
Wednesday Mr. Robert Berini, IBM 
Branch Manager, came to CMU to share 
his insights. In his two hour talk, he in
spired many, intrigued some, but enter
tained all.
Make them think they want it seam
ed to sum up IBMs sales policy well. A 
good salesperson does his homework, 
find out the buyers needs and twist them 
to suit your offers. Allways make him feel 
like hes getting the good end of the deal.
No earth shaking advice, but it never 
hurts to restate it.
It doesnt matter what your selling, its 
how you sell yourself. If you can put on 
a good act, youll go far in sales. So the 
first thing is to make buddies with the 
buyer. Mr. Berini let us in on one of his 
litte schemes. Before the sales call, give 
the secratary a call. Pry up some tid-bit 
from the targets personal life. So, Mr. 
Executive, I hear you shoot a mean bir
die down at Expensive Country Club...
Phase One of the sales call is complete, 
he loves you.
The next step is easy, just sit back and 
pretend to listen to his bragging, interjec
ting an occasional Really?, Wow!, 
or Incredible. But as Mr. Berini 
pointed out, a sales call is a sales call. Some 
how you must change the subject to your pro
duct. I know what you mean about those crazy 
Mets, just imagine what they could do with an 
IBM XT!
Story on Selling the IBM Way
Now comes the tough part, the actual selling. 
Youve got to be quick on your feet, never 
defensive, have a reply to every objection, and 
always agree with the customer. Although this 
may sound impossible to us civilians, Mr. Berini
was living proof that its just a matter experience 
and talent.
After an hour and a half of making it all sound 
so easy, Mr. Berini brought up a semi-volunteer 
from the audience. Mr. Berini played the typical
apathetic, uninterested businessman, 
while Seth Kaplan tried convince him to 
participate in AIESEC, the organization 
responsable for the evenings talk. It 
quickly became very apparent just how 
hard selling really is.
In all, Mr. Berinis advice was basic, 
accurate, and to the point. He did not 
give us any magic sales lines or sure-fire 
schemes, just good, clean guidelines for 
the inexperienced. For those who ex
pected to hear that IBM teaches all of its 
salemen hypnosis, there was a letdown. 
IBM seams to earn their customers the 
old fashioned way, simple, but proven 
salesman psychology. It is almost 
refreshing to hear someone admit that 
they work for a living.
Then, of course, the selling really 
started. Mr. Berini broke out his litde IBM 
PC laptop. I have never seen such a cute 
computer. At 13 lbs., this is one of the 
first truely portable computers I have ever 
seen. He gave us the whole run down: 
3V4 drives, 2 printer, snap on modem, 
IBM PC compatibility, even a software 
demo. Now, you would think no salesman 
would have a harder time than trying to 
sell a computer to a CMU student, but 
Mr. Berini handled himself impressive
ly. He fought off critisisms from MacPeople and Andrewists alike, with eloquence 
and poise. By the end of his presentation, 
he could have gotten thirty orders on the 
spot. The IBM winning combination was 
clear: a solid product backed by a solid 
sales force.Mr. Berini s lecture was sponsored by Carnegie Mellon AIESEC, the campus chapter of a international exchange program for business inter- ships abroad.
Someone Finaly Asks: Why No Presents
By CILFF MODE
Tartan Staffwriter
Well, its that time of the year again and Im 
psyched and ready. You probably think that Im 
so eagerly refering to Carniyal86 but Im real
ly talking about Passover, that holiday among 
holidays. I think that everyone on campus is just 
insecure about admitting it as well, trying to con
vince everyone else that theyre really psyched 
for Carnival. Well, I see right through it. The 
fraternities totally went gung ho! in trying to 
cover up this latent anxiety about Passover by 
building elaborate and creative booths. Yeah, 
you guys are really excited about this thing I 
bet, but if you dont keep kosher, the shay gets 
will hit the fan.
Among other things, one who is celebrating 
Passover isnt supposed to eat bread. This rules 
out the Tartan and MOREpizza but we still have 
Kiltie, Ah, Kiltie Cafe where we can avoid bread 
if we try hard enough. Dont try any funny stuff 
either like putting bread and other prohibited 
foods in your pockets or other places just to be 
able to sacreligiously stuff your face when your 
alone. I dont think you could live with yourself 
after that, I certainly couldnt.
There are ways around the problem of 
scrutinizing everything that enters your mouth 
during Passover. If you look around the super
market you can find all sorts of food that by 
some modern day miracle has been ordained 
as kosher. I swear on my life that I've seen 
kosher twinkies. Naturally I had to buy several 
to fully attain the religious piety that I should 
gain from eating kosher twinkies. To my amaze
ment, there is kosher soda as well. Phew!!! At 
least now I know that during Passover I can still 
rot my teeth. Almost any commonly known food 
can be bought in a kosher version. I just want 
someone to tell me how you would go about 
making a twinkie kosher. I mean, were talking 
about one down rabbi who can see the need 
for twinkies for the youth of America.
I see some connection between the 
significance of Passover and the mentality ram
pant throughout the entire campus. Passover is 
a yearly rememberance of the once harsh treat
ment of Jewish people in Egypt. Well, I think 
it would make a great occasion to remember the 
cruel treatment of students right here at CMU. 
Its almost the end of the year and were about 
to be vindicated for about four months so why 
not take a week out of your life to remember 
those who didnt pass Diffy Qs and also those 
who spent the entire year in the library due to 
unruly noise in their dorm or frathouse. These 
are truly our present day martyrs. If youre still 
skeptical, what about those poor people who 
paint the fence and then sit and watch that it 
doesnt go anywhere for the entire night. They 
make this country safe. Passover has the poten
tial to become really big here at CMU only if 
people realize that the true heroes are right in 
front of us or at least have just recently passed 
away from the mentioned atrocities.
Keeping kosher will have to be sort of redefin
ed. All of you know now what the rudiments 
of keeping kosher are. Well, instead of looking 
for food with kosher markings on them, limit 
yourself to eating UDS food for the week or so. 
No Capri, Fiorenzo, Little Italy, .or especially 
Dominos. When youre feeling most devout, 
limit yourself to just Kiltie. This version of keep
ing kosher is called keeping Kiltie. It will 
definitely separate the followers from the true 
believers. I think we can get the school to supply 
yamachas for everyone. Whats a yamacha? No 
its not a motorcycle, it's a beanie. Presents 
would definitely add to the flavor of it all. 
Christmas and Chanukah both REQUIRE the 
giving of presents, it would be corrupt not to. 
Well, whats wrong with this way of looking at 
it for Passover? A traditional thing to do for 
Passover is to hide a piece of Matzah(unleavened bread) and let the youngest kid 
in the family go find it. This is the 80 s and I
dont know many four year olds who care about 
unleavened bread or much else. Try hiding a 
CD player or a beautiful blonde. Let the most 
deprived member of each class participate. Get 
them off the computer and into the fresh air. 
This actually sounds fun, maybe Ill even play. 
An event like this one could truly bring the cam
pus together.
Call me disrespectful, sacreligious, wrong, or 
just plain stupid, I dont care because Im 
psyched about Passover and the possibilities it 
holds for CMU students of the near future. Let 
everyone else believe that Carnival was the
for Passover?
cause for the anxiety felt at this time of the year 
all over campus.
One final thing, during Passover it is tradi
tional to keep your door open. This is so the 
Prophet Elijah can enter and sip your wine with 
you. Well, this year Elijah is going to be wear
ing a CMU T-shirt and will be about 57 with 
brown hair and brown eyes. Make sure you 
welcome him and wish him well. Hell take your 
name and number down if youre in favor of 
the changes mentioned in this document. 
Monetary donations and food will also be ac
cepted. Until next time.

good, along with an experience youll never 
forget.
A new book by Josh Groves explains it all. 
From hiching across Canada, to what kind of 
boots to wear, The Best Summer Jobs in Alaska 
tells to whole story.
Mr. Groves, a Brown graduate, spent three 
summers in Alaska, and seems to be very 
knowledgeable. This not a Go for it! book as 
would be expected. Instead, it presents an 
honest look at the life to be expected. Instead 
of round the clock parties, most visitors find 
round the clock shifts. Alaskas crisp, fresh air 
goes unnoticed by the canery workers who know 
only the pungent odor of rancid halibut.
The book covers all the bases, and would be 
useful not only as a backround to help the un
sure, but also as a resource to the determined. 
It comes highly recommended to those who are 
used to spending their summers sipping the 
white wine spritzers with Trish and Papah.

j^mong the new clubs which were formed this 
ester, is the Carnegie Mellon Weightlifting 
Bodybuilding Club. The Club was foundI be by Charlie Reinhard, Lionel Young, Dave 
rcorhan, and Uday Patnaik. In less than two 
,nths of existence, the Weightlifting and 
idybuilding Club has become the largest 
,rts club on campus, in terms of numbers. 
It is clear that the interests of students here 
iarnegie Mellon are diverse and diffuse. The 
rubers of our club are no exception to this 
le. One of our interests happens to be 
|dybuilding and I firmly believe that the conioning done by the men and women who seek 
se ends functions as a noticeable betterUnt. said Reinhard.
[
 he club was the first organization to gain exded gym hours. Student Senate has since exded gym hours for the entire campus comlinity, but the weight club has had the weight
 )m open on Sunday nights and Saturday mor igs for its members for two semesters, a full 
Bnester before it was open to everyone else. 
Hn addition, the club will be sponsoring its first
bodybuilding event this Thursis
club to sponsor competition Thursday
being directed by Joe Calone, manager of the 
Caber Club, and Charlie Reinhard, a founder 
of the weight club.
This competition is the first of its kind at 
Carnegie Mellon University. Applications have 
been arriving at the Caber Club and so far, Pitt, 
Point Park and Carnegie Mellon have the most 
contestants entered in the competition. As of 
now, equal numbers of men and women have 
been applying to participate.
The event will feature two guest posers, John 
Pappas and Colleen Naccarelli. Both posers are 
former champions; Pappas was the first Pitt
sburgh Collegiate Mens Champion in 1982. He 
had since gone on to win six competitions in 
1985, including North Pittsburgh and interstate 
competitions. Two weeks ago he won the Gold 
Eagle Classic and promises to be to be a big 
in bodybuilding in the future.
The Exercise Company, Third place national 
aerobic dancers will also be performing at the 
event. Topping off the extravaganza will be guest 
appearances of the Steelers offensive tackle, 
Pete Rostosky and the Pirate Parrot, the Pitts
burgh Pirates team mascot.

Bonie more thoughts that I am sure you
I illy do not care about, especially after that
II tame weekend:
jJTl do not understand why everyone takes 
races so seriously. I mean, if it were up 
1 would enter more buggies with themes 
I ilar to the SAE Blues Brothers theme. But 
'?r<itulations anyway to all you who practiced
I * Gained so hard for this years race. I sureH'iild not have done it.
11 do not suppose anyone wants t> bu>
my Pittsburgh Spirit indoor soccer tickets for 
next year.
If youre willing to take indoor soccer
tickets off my hands, then perhaps you would 
like my Pittsburgh Maulers USFL season tickets.
--And if you are willing to buy those
tickets, then I could also get you a good deal 
on Three Rivers Stadium.
Prime time for the NBA playoffs has
begun and I, although realizing that the realistic 
pick is either the LA Lakers or the Boston 
Celtics, think that the Philadelphia 76ers have 
^goad'lihot'trrwiTrit-Hll: Rut-1- do say that-everyvear.
-The Cincinnati Reds finally have a
strong team which I am looking lo go a long 
way with former Pirate MVP Dave Parker and 
everyones favorite, Pete Rose. However, I do 
not even know if they have a team mascot.
-Well look at those Pirates. Already they 
have nearly captured a stronghold on first place.
I even predicted it.
Hopefully this is the year that the NHL 
is embarrassed by their 16 team playoff system. 
Already, underdog teams such as the New York 
Rangers. Hartford Whalers and Toronto Maple
Leafs have defeated their favored opponents. 
If Toronto wins, it will be especially sweet 
because they finished almost at the bottom of 
the league during the regular season. Believe 
me, if the Rangers play the Maple Leefs in the 
Stanley Cup, there will be very little fan interest 
and many disconsolate people in the NHL 
league office.
-If you are not a native Pittsburgher, then 
you will not know that you are escaping the ci
ty just before the big media coverage on the 
Steelers resumes, with the start of the Pro Draft. 
People around here start talking about football 
as. if it were September, not Mav. - . ------ .

Male tracksters win. . .
Track team notches 49th and 50th consecutive victories
The highlight of the 1986 Annual Intramural 
Dinner held in Room 100, Skibo on Tuesday, 
April 15th occurred when Betty Moeslin, the 
security guard on the main entrance of the 
Carnegie Mellon University gym building, was 
presented the 1986 Intramural Boards appreciation award.
This award was started last year and is 
presented by the Intramural Board to the per
son who has given outstanding contributions to 
the Carnegie Mellon Universitys Intramural Program during the past year.
The IM Board elected Betty Moeslin not on
ly for her excellent method of checking securi
ty in the gym building, but also her pleasant 
manner and friendly greetings to all of the In
tramural players who use the gym building.
Betty has been the security person here at 
Carnegie Mellon University for the past four 
years and has made hundreds of friends due 
to her great smile and pleasing personality.
Bettys quote, I love my job here at Carnegie 
Mellon University because everyone has been 
really nice to me. The student always have a 
friendly greeting and smile for me; I feel for
tunate to have a position where I can meet so

Golf squad takes on the 
6big boys; place 10th
By STEW LEVINE
Tartan Staffwriter
Last week, the golf Tartans tried to take on 
the big boys at the Slippery Rock Invitational. 
They came away with a tenth place finish in a 
field of twenty from all three NCAA Divisions, 
and second among Division III rivals, outshot 
by former National Champ Allegheny.
The afternoon was a rough one with cold 
temperatures and high winds inflating the Tar
tans showing to a 426. The golfers were led by 
Mike Fisher who shot a 79 on the course. He 
was followed by Bruce Irvins at 83, and Mike 
Fitterman and Mike Morini who ended the day 
at 84.
According to Fitterman the weather affected 
everyone, but him especially, I was five over 
until the last seven holes, then the temperature 
dropped, the wind picked up, and I went seven 
over on the next three holes. The weather af
fected
play for 45 minutes because of thunderstorms,
Fitterman, who was the gold medalist at " 
PAC Invitational two weeks ago, has had an and down season. Against Westminster I 
played bad, the rest of the time it was 
weather, my scores should come down. A 
beginning of the year, I was playing better 
normal, usually I have trouble at the 
of the year.
The junior also had this to say about the 
and its prospects at the PAC Championships 
two weeks. We have a good shot at the P 
Grove City doesnt have much of a chance, 
Washington and Jefferson has some g 
players, they could do it if they are hot.
The golfers have two more events before 
Championships. Today they are at home 
cross-town rival Dusquesne, and later this 
they travel up to Allegheny for the
many nice people and make so many friends. 
Without a doubt Betty Moeslein is one of the
most popular women on campus and certainly 
deserves the honor of receiving the Intramural 
Boards 1986 Award of Appreciation. 
Congratulations to you Betty!
Thiel on Sunday. The meets, held at Hiram col
lege, were the Tartan's 49th and 50th con
secutive dual meet victories.
Coach Meckley had praise for his squads 
comeback. It was a pretty good overall per
formance. The team showed a little more fire 
this week...We can win the conference cham
pionship if the kids want to win. We took im
portant steps this week, but we need more 
steps.
Versus Hiram, Carnegie Mellon captured 16 
out of a possible 17 first place finishes, rolling 
to 112-33 victory. The only event in which the 
Tartans did not place first, the 800m, the team 
finished second.
They were similarly dominating over Thiel, 
taking 13 firsts as they wiped up with a 105-38 
win.The Tartans had three performers who 
managed to grab double triumphs. Sophomore 
Damian McKnight came out on top in two hurGrove City has a lot of talent. He noted that 
with the graduating seniors, the Tartans had lost 
116 out of 150 some points scored the 
previous year. Were still a young team. Grove 
Citys team is mostly juniors and seniors, while 
we are mostly freshman and sophomores.
One thing that has hurt the Tartans this year 
is injuries. One of our best hurdlers is injured. 
One of our best runners has strep throat...If we 
can get everybody back to full strength, well 
win the conference championship, commented 
Meckley.
Next week, the Tartans have three meets. 
They face Bethany and Washington & Jeffer
son on Wednesday, a contest Meckley con
fidently predicts well win. The big matchup, 
however, is versus Grove City at home on Satur
day. That meet is a toss up. If they get a cou
ple people hurt or sick, we should win. The team 
that gets the most breaks in the next week will 
win.
By JOHN FRIEDMANN
Tartan Business Manager 
The mens track team is once again back on 
the winning trail. They rebounded from their 
unprecedented relay loss to Grove City with 
double dual meet victories over Hiram and
die events, the 400m intermediate and 110m 
high hurdles. Another sophomore, Jeff Luster, 
won the 100 and 200 meter races. The third 
winner,Steve Antonson, took the long jump and 
triple jump.
Looking ahead to the next meets, Coach 
Meckley commented We are on our way. But
