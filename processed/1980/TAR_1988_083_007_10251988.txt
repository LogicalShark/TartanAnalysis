SEI protestor Vincent Eirene holds press conference
By JAMES B. ENDRES
Tartan Staffwriter
Local activist Vincent Eirene, 
who has gained familiarity around 
CMU oyer the past year as a re
sult of his protests against the 
Software Engineering Institute 
(SEI), staged a press conference 
in front of Warner Hall Friday at 
12:30 pm.
Eirene began by stating that 
the aim of the press conference 
was to reveal...the different
weapon systems that Carnegie 
Mellon University and the Soft
ware Engineering Institute are 
involved in.
While supporters held banners 
declaring Earthpeace Not Starwars and Carnegie Mellon War 
College, Eirene repeated a for
mer claim that even though SEI 
holds only unclassified docu
ments, he and his group have 
been denied access to them.
We are here today to reveal the 
internal documents of SEI... in a
paper which we believe is read
able...., stated Eirene. He then 
distributed a pamphlet that out
lined what he described as eleven 
different major weapon systems 
that SEI is involved in. Eirene 
did not make clear by what 
method his group had acquired 
the , information included in the 
pamphlets.
Meanwhile, Eirene claimed that 
he received a promise from Pro
vost Angel Jordan that a list of 
what Eirene called the military
contracts that Carnegie Mellon 
War College is involved with 
would be delivered to the Student 
Union. He further claimed that 
since their last meeting, Jordan 
told Eirene that he [Jordan] 
would not give [Eirenes group] 
any of the military research thats 
going on here.
Repeating a theme from his last 
talk at Carnegie Mellon, Eirene 
said, Do not participate in the 
unfruitful works of darkness, but 
expose them. He asserted that
it is not enough to be informed 
and maintained that a changec 
life that engages the systems oi 
darkness is necessary.
At this point in the press con
ference, Eirene produced a num
ber of candles that he and his 
supporters planned to deliver to 
Jordan, who was out of the coun
try at the time. He did not, how
ever, attempt to perform any act 
of civil disobedience, as he has 
done in the past. Instead, he urged

A ruptured acetylene tank in the steam 
tunnels beneath Baker and Porter Halls 
on Wednesday morning filled the build

ate everyone for approximately 15 min
utes.
According to Peter Collopy, Director of 
Environmental Health and Safety, weld
ers installing chilled water pipes in the 
tunnels turned their torches off before 
leaving for a coffee break but failed to shut 
off the oxygen and acetylene tanks fueling 
the torches. In his investigation, Collopy 
inferred that sparks generated in cutting 
the pipe fell on the hoses or other combus
tible materials, and caused a relief plug in 
the tank to blow.
Smoke from the burning hoses rose 
through the buildings, travelling through 
the vents of Baker and Porter Halls. 
Campus Police Chief James LaPaglia 
pulled the fire alarm after being notified of 
the strong odor of smoke by a professor. At 
9:28 am the buildings were evacuated. In 
areas with a high concentration of smoke, 
said LaPaglia, security personnel were 
stationed until the incident was cleared.

Senate
overrides
Robitshek
By KARL BARNHART
Tartan Editor-in-Chief
Voting 18-0^2, Student Senate overruled 
the Student Government Presidents veto 
on the resolution supporting the Pitts
burgh City Council gay-rights legislation.
After Senate passed the resolution two 
weeks ago, Student Government Presi
dent Andy Robitshek vetoed it because of 
the way it was discussed at Senate. 
...[T]here was never a copy of the ordi
nance provided to the Senators.
Last week, CIT Senator Chuck Jainchill 
re-introduced the resolution with a copy 
City Councils gay-rights legislation at
tached to it. In addition, Jainchill changed 
the resolution so that Senate was defined 
as an elected representative body of the 
students.
After a motion by H&SS Senator Matt 
Ruben to limit debate to 12 minutes failed, 
CIT Senator Barry Brumitt moved to post
pone the resolution indefinitely. Brumitts 
resolution also failed.

Dukakis speaks in McKeesport
By ERIC W. LEULIETTE
Tartan Contributing Editor
Nearly 100 Carnegie Mellon 
students attended a rally for 
presidential candidate Michael 
Dukakis. A crowd of more than 
2,000 Dukakis supporters stood 
in freezing rain for over an hour 
on Friday evening to hear the 
Massachusetts Governor speak at 
McKeesports John F. Kennedy 
Memorial Park.
With decaying steel factories of 
the Mon Valley and a towering 
statue of John Kennedy as a back
drop, Dukakis spoke about the 
economy and drugs.
The Democratic nominee prom
ised to create new jobs in Western 
Pennsylvania.
Dukakis also promised the 
crowd he would restrict foreign 
steel imports and return steel to 
this valley.
In an effort to show his warmer 
side, when Dukakis spoke of the
nations illegal drug problems, he 
referred to his father and brother. 
My father, a doctor, was bound 
and gagged by thieves who were 
looking for drugs and my brother 
was killed by a hit-and-run driver 
whom we always assumed was 
drunk or on drugs.
. On stage with Dukakis were 
Pennsylvania Governor Robert 
Casey, Atlanta Mayor Andrew 
Young, Steelworkers President 
Lynn Williams, former Steeler 
Franco Harris, and actor Albert 
Brooks.
Brooks elicited cheers from the 
crowd when he complained about 
rising college tuition costs. He 
joked that after four years of 
George Bush as President even 
Dan Quayles father couldnt pay 
for college.
Dukakis referred to Kennedy 
as another son from the state of 
Massachusetts who ran for Presi
dent.
Dukakis compared Kennedys
narrow win in the 1960 election to 
the current race.
Kennedy spoke at the park, whic 
now bears his name in 1963, a 
month before he was assassi
nated.
At the end of his remarks, 
Dukakis was presented with a 
Steeler jacket and a football from 
Harriss son. Completing the 
media event, Dukakis tossed the 
ball into the crowd several times 
before shaking hands and leav
ing.
Two bus loads of students from 
Carnegie Mellon and Carlow 
College attended the rally as VF3". 
The trip to see Dukakis was spon
sored by Carnegie Mellons Col
lege Democrats.
Chuck Jainchill, head of Carne
gie Mellons College Democrats, 
called the event a qualified suc
cess, indicating that he thought 
the turnout had been adequate 
considering the inclement 
weather.

Murder victims
By JONATHAN LEVY
Tartan Assistant News Editor
Stella Goldberg, the mother of a 
Robert Morris student killed two 
years ago by Carnegie Mellon 
freshman Darrell Van Mastrigt, 
has filed a lawsuit against Carne
gie Mellon, Delta Tau Delta fra
ternity, and Van Mastrigt.
Jeanne Goldberg, 20, was 
stabbed to death by Van Mastrigt, 
19, on the morning of February 8, 
1987 in South Park.
Van Mastrigt confessed to the 
murder early the next morning 
after going to the police to give 
information about Goldberg.
Van Mastrigt was convicted of 
first degree murder on Septem
ber 22 and is currently serving a 
life sentence in the State Correc
tional Institution 
at Huntington.
Goldberg and 
Van Mastrigt met 
through a com
mon friend and 
the three of them 
spent the evening 
of February 7,
1987 at several 
parties.
The last party they attended 
was at DTD where Van Mastrigt 
said they drank beer and smoked 
marijuana. After leaving DTD, 
Goldberg and Van Mastrigt sepa
rated from their friend and spent 
the rest of the night together until 
Van Mastrigt stabbed Goldberg 
to death early in the morning on 
September 8, shortly after hav
ing sex with her. No motive for
the killing has been established.
Stella Goldberg believes that 
Van Mastrigt would not have 
killed her daughter if they had 
not both been under the influence 
of the alcohol and marijuana.
At the time of her death, Jeanne 
Goldbergs blood alcohol level was 
.4 percent, four times the legal 
definition of intoxication. Van 
Mastrigts blood alcohol level was 
never measured because he was

NICOSIA (DJ)  Irans foreign 
minister said last Monday that 
Iran agreed to a United Nations 
formula for implementing a peace 
treaty to end its war with Iraq, in
cluding dredging the waterway 
that lies between the Gulf War 
foes.
The official Islamic Republic 
News Agency, monitored in Nico
sia, quoted Minister Ali Akhbar 
Velayati as saying that Iran ac
cepted the compromise formula 
for peace worked out by U.N. 
Secretary-General Javier Perez 
de Cuellar.
Velayati said Iran accepts the 
four-point plan on condition that 
the 1975 agreement placing the 
border in the middle of the water
way be maintained.
The waterway in the northern 
gulf is known as the Shatt AlArab to Iraq and the Arvand River 
to Iran.
The four conditions that Ve
layati said Iran agreed to are the 
withdrawal of all forces to inter
national boundaries, agreeing not 
to search ships in the gulf, ex
changing prisoners of war and 
dredging the waterway.
The peace talks had stalled right 
after they started Aug. 25 over 
Iraqs insistence that the water
way be dredged. Iran had rejected 
the demand, saying it was a sec
ondary issue that could be settled 
later.
There was no immediate reac
tion from Iraq to the Iranian for
eign ministers statement, but it 
has rejected the 1975 agreement 
in the past.

NEW YORK (DJ)  A federal 
grand jury indicted deposed Phil
ippine president Ferdinand Mar
cos Friday on racketeering 
charges and named his wife 
Imelda and Saudi businessman 
Adnan Kashoggi as accessories.
The indictment alleges that 
Marcos obtained about $103 mil
lion through embezzlement and 
fraud for personal use to purchase 
expensive art work and New York 
real estate.
The. Marcoses have been the 
focus of a grand jury criminal 
investigation started in June 1986 
for their alleged violation of the 
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt 
Organizations Law.
The government charges Mar
cos, 71, and his wife, 59, trans
ferred ownership of the New York 
real estate to Kashoggi, 53, and 
backdated these papers at the 
start of the investigation.
The Marcoses also face civil 
contempt charges for failing to 
comply with four federal grand 
jury subpoenas which sought their 
fingerprints, palm prints, voice 
and wiiting samples, as well as 
their authorization to turn over 
financial records to the grandjury.
President Reagan said he was 
saddened by Marcos indict
ment, his spokesman said.
White House spokesman Mar
lin Fitzwater said the president 
allowed the Justice Department 
to proceed because no foreim 
policy considerations stood in the 
way. He said Reagan realizes now 
its time for the justice system to 
take its course.
Reagan is saddened that it 
happened, because he (Marcos) is 
an old friend and a friend of the 
country, Fitzwater said.
The spokesman also stressed, 
however, that Marcos has been 
indicted concerning matters that 
allegedly took place since he ar
rived in the U.S. in 1986.
According to the indictment, 
Marcos transferred $103 million 
into the U.S. to buy New York 
real estate and defrauded bank
ing institutions of more than $165 
million in the purchase and fi
nancing of those properties.

WASHINGTON (DJ)  The 
Food and Drug Administration 
said it is implementing a plan to 
reduce the time required for 
human testing of drugs for lifethreatening and severely debili
tating diseases, including AIDS.
FDA Commissioner Frank E. 
Young said the plan was devel
oped at the request of the 
Presidents Task Force on Regu
latory Relief.
The announcement comes a few 
days after demonstrators blocked 
the FDAs headquarters in 
Rockville, Md., protesting, among 
other things, what they called 
FDA foot-dragging in testing 
drugs to combat AIDS.
Under the plan announced to
day, the FDA said it would work 
with drug researchers to better 
focus their efforts early in a drugs 
development and thereby elimi
nate, for such diseases as AIDS 
and some cancers, the last of the 
three traditional phases of hu
man drug research.
This effort is aimed at obtain
ing sufficient data in the early 
stages so that the FDA, taking 
into account the life-threatening 
or debilitating nature of the dis
ease or condition and the alterna
tives available, could evaluate a 
product more quickly.

Steams went on to say, how
ever that the biggest problem is

the biggest problem is funding. 
When asked how he would like
to see the modem language pro
gram structured, Steams ex
plained that he would like some 
sort of administrative arrange
ment where languages get more 
attention.
Steams explained that this 
could be either within the current

that if were really 
successful in the 
short term, there 
will probably be cre

be given departmental status 
because of the constraint on new 
positions.
Dean Fienberg also hopes to see 
the addition of new positions in 
the future.
Sono Takano-Hayes, who 
teaches Japanese at CMU, stated 
I dont think the modem lan
guage program is developed 
enough.
Takano-Hayes also said I 
would like to see this program 
become a more independent pro
gram.
Fienberg and Tarr both ex
pressed excitement in hidden 
resources in foreign language that 
exist at Carnegie Mellon, citing 
members of faculty in other de
partments and colleges that are 
fluent in foreign languages or 
experts in foreign culture or lit
erature.
Tarr proposed that some sort of 
center that has a director, that 
has links to a number of other 
departments be made to coordi
nate all of the resources.
Fienberg concluded by saying 
that if our resources are to be 
tapped, what we need is a stronger 
nucleus and careful planning. 
That wont come overnight.
SDC establishes movie policy
By CARLOS FRANCO
Tartan News Editor
Due to concerns over break
ing the Federal Copyright Act, 
the Student Dormitory Council 
(SDC) has initiated a policy 
concerning the viewing of video 
rental movies; previously there 
was no set policy.
SDC Vice President Bryan 
Wong established the policy 
that states, ...videotapes; 
rented from local video store, 
purchased from retail outlets 
or illegally recorded from payTV movie channels, are not to 
be exhibited publicly.
This policy excludes the view
ing of any rental movies on any 
of SDCs televisions or with any 
SDC video cassette recorders in 
dormitory lounges. This does 
not exclude the viewing of video 
tapes in a students dorm room.
Wong feels the policy will be 
temporary and stated, We are 
going to follow it to the letter of 
the law in terms of SDC and resi
dence halls. We dont want to take 
any chances....The penalties are 
too severe.
According to Wong, the first of
fense is punishable by up to one 
year in jail, a $25,000 fine, or 
both; the second and each subse
quent offense are punishable by 
up to two years in jail or both. 
Another possible legal ramifica
tion is that SDC and Activities 
Board could lose their rights to 
show movies for up to ten years.
The idea for a video-tape policy 
came out of a national residence 
hall conference held over the sum
mer.
About the law, Wong stated, ... 
everyone [at the conference] had 
their own version of what the law 
was and everybody does even right
now, and we tried to establish 
what was legal and what was il
legal.
In order to clarify interpreta
tion of the law, Assistant to the 
Dean for Legal Services Ron 
Campana is looking into the 
issue to see if there are any 
established legal precedents. 
Wong stated the policy could 
change depending on what 
Campana uncovers.
When questioned about the 
new policy, Director of Housing 
Anthony Martin stated that he 
feels that no laws have been 
broken, and no new restricting 
policy should be established 
without good reason. According 
to Martin, whether or not the 
lounges are public or private 
has yet to be decided. He 
equated most dormitory lounges 
with a private homes living 
room.

Some of the issues and concerns to be addressed are:
- Ignorance to history of various cultures
- Minority myths: Belief on some students' parts that many minority students, especially Blacks, had lower admission standards, receive more financial 
aid, dont perform as well academically.
- Homophobia: GALA (Gay and lesbian Alliance) has been the target of some threats and negative publicity.
- Religious awareness: Diverse religious population exists, but there seems to be little in the way of exploration or appreciation (e.g., recognizing Jewish 
holidays, etc.)
- Other issues such as lack of positive role models, Asian student concerns, as well as inter-racial dating will be explored.

members. Also the IFC Repre
sentative was changed to the 
Greek Council. The motion is 
automatically tabled.
Acetylene tank ruptures under Baker Hall
continued from page 1
into the building at 9:45AM, after 
the cause of the smoke had been 
determined and the area judged 
to be safe. Upon realizing that 
the alarm was more than a drill, 
most professors dismissed their 
classes for the day.
As a matter of course in any 
incident involving chemicals, 
said Collopy, the hazardous 
materials team was automatically 
called. Because it was a potential 
source of flame, the ruptured tank 
was removed from the tunnel and 
taken to an open area where the
fumes could dissipate. Work in 
the tunnels was delayed until a 
critique on Wednesday afternoon 
determined what caused the inci
dent.
By better setting up and pre
paring the work areas, limiting 
the amount of combustible mate
rials present and shielding tanks, 
the evaluating physical plant 
team feels a re-occurrence can be 
prevented.
Also, said Collopy, a fire watch 
in work areas 10 to 15 minutes 
after theyve ceased cutting the 
pipes will provide more rapid
reactions.
Thomas Murphy, Director if 
Construction, said that new coiijputer labs and offices for Carne
gie Institute of Technology ar 
being created between Porter ar$ 
Scaife Halls.
This will free space in the seSond basement of Porter Hall f<$-

Off-campus assaults are on the rise
RANDY L. UDAVCAK
Tartan Staffwriter
In response to a growing number of offcampus assaults, campus police have 
issued a crime alert to all Carnegie Mellon 
students.
Since the beginning of the semester, 
there have been at least six reported 
assaults made on Carnegie Mellon stu
dents, a number Chief of Campus Police 
James LaPaglia calls entirely too much.
The Tartans crime and incident re
port, which is usually besieged with 
accounts of mischief and theft at the 
worst, is now being inundated with inci
dents ranging from harassment to as
sault and robbery.
LaPaglia said that such incidents in 
the Oakland area are not uncommon. 
What is unusual is the increased in
volvement of Carnegie Mellon students 
in these crimes as victims, and what ap
pears to be an increase in incidents per
petrated by street gangs.
Currently, no pattern seems to be 
present in either the nature or location of 
the attacks.
The assaults have taken place as far 
off campus as Forbes and Bellefield, and 
as close as Morewood Avenue near the 
fraternities.
The fraternities were the site of an
That's when I tried 
to walk away ...and 
thats when they 
wouldnt let me.
Assault Victim
assault on a female Carnegie Mellon stu
dent in which the victim was struck, but 
managed to flee to safety.
The student, who did not wish to be 
identified, said she was walking from 
the fraternities to Morewood when she 
was approached by three college-age 
males who started making lewd com
ments to her.
Thats when I tried to walk away 
...and thats when they wouldnt let me, 
she said. As if this experience was not 
traumatizing enough, she said that 
scarcely a week later she and her friends 
were approached and propositioned by 
several men on the comer of Atwood and 
Forbes.
The women managed to get away, and 
the incident became one of many crimes 
that go unreported.
Apparently the current situation is a
continuation of incidents which arose 
toward the end of last year when the 
problem of off-campus attacks first be
gan to surface as a major concern to 
Campus Police. One such incident in
volved a male Carnegie Mellon student 
who was knocked unconscious by an as
sailant.
The Carnegie Mellon Police say their 
aim is not to scare students, but to make 
them aware that a problem exists, and to 
urge them to take appropriate measures 
to avoid becoming involved in dangerous 
situations.
Toward this end, the Campus Police 
have circulated fliers to all Resident 
Assistants to be posted in their respec
tive residence halls.
One tip not on this list which LaPaglia 
emphasized is to avoid street gangs, or 
any group of three or more people who 
seem to be loitering.
Additionally, he said that any student 
who is in a questionable situation or who 
feels threatened in any way may call 
campus police from any store or public 
telephone and a Campus Police car will 
be sent to pick up the student who is in 
possible danger.
The Carnegie Mellon Campus Police 
assert that students must stay aware 
and informed if such crimes are to be pre-; 
vented.

The College of Fine Arts will 
frost the eighth anniversary of 
foe Beaux Arts Ball this spring; 
however, a question that has yet 
io be decided is whether or not allohol will be served at the event.
A student committee, including 
rmembers of all the CFA depart
ments, has been set up to plan the 
ball. Meredith Myers, Assistant 
Dean of CFA, is the staff adminis
trator in charge of the event.
The last ball, held on February 
23, 1985, resulted in flooded 
poms, a broken statue, vandal
ism, and graffiti in the CFA build
ing. According to Myers, Dean 
Akram Midani will not sanction 
anything but an alcohol-free 
event. It is a significant legal ispue. This is the only way the event 
jvill occur.
Administrators feel that 
without alcohol, this years ball 
will be more controlled. However, 
Troy Lambert, Committee Head, 
feels that if alcohol is not allowed, 
most students will bring their own 
drinks anyway. He hopes that 
Carnegie Mellon will permit alco
hol to be served upon presenta
tion of an ID. Lambert will meet 
this week with Dean of Student 
Affairs Braden Walter to decide 
the alcohol question.
The event will be located in the 
Fine Arts Building and is by na
ture a costume/masquerade ball. 
One of the duties of the commit
tee has been selecting a theme for 
the ball. As Lambert stated, for 
Beaux Arts Ball, we wanted a 
broad theme that would encom
pass many ideas and not tie people 
down. The committee has desig
nated Extremes as this years 
theme. It was the top choice from
a list including Era and Leg
ends. Beaux Arts Ball occupies 
all levels of the CFA building, 
which will be specially decorated 
for the event. The ball will in
clude bands and activities. It lasts 
from 10 pm to 6 am. Both food and 
beverages will be served. Alumni 
and the surrounding community 
are invited to attend. The event is 
sponsored by Student Affairs.
The history of Beaux Arts Ball 
can be traced back to 1915 when 
it was imported from France. The 
Ball is an imitation of the Le Bal 
des Beaux Arts, a costume/mas
querade party thrown by students 
of LEcole des Beaux Arts. Beaux 
Arts is a tradition of celebration 
and pleasure. At Carnegie Mel
lon, it is held once every four years 
in honor of Henry Hombostel, a 
graduate of a Parisian university 
who designed the Carnegie Mel
lon campus.
Gay rights bill passed by Senate
continued from page 1
Berger, a former Senator and 
inember of the audience, asked 
Robitshek if he supported the 
resolution since Senate had a copy 
of the Councils ordinance. Robitshek said yes.
* With no objections, the resolu
tion was put to a hand vote, and 
penate had the 2/3 majority 
Jieeded for an override.
Since Ruben introduced the
original resolution three weeks 
ago, Pittsburgh City Council's 
gay-rights legislation failed 4-4. 
Senates resolution asks Council 
to reconsider its proposed ordi
nance.
In other business, Jainchill un
tabled ABs constitution and 
moved to un-freeze ABs funds. 
After a short discussion, the 
constitution was accepted with a 
few recommendations which AB
Chairman Doug Carey accepted 
as friendly amendments and ABs 
funds were unfrozen.
Also, H&SS Senator Kirk Lenga 
proposed an amendment. Under 
Duties of Student Senate, Article 
IV, Section 2, Part A, Lenga pro
posed to add Student Ombuds
man to the list of Ex-Officio 
members. The motion was tabled 
for one week as are all constitu
tional amendments.

Its a simple rule: If you paint the 
Fence, dont paint the trees.
Yet in one of the biggest displays 
of campus stupidity in recent 
months, the people who painted 
the Fence for Hoopla 88 color-co
ordinated the Fence and the trees 
to advertise their dance/basket
ball exhibition.
Now, long after the Fence has 
been re-painted, we are left with 
maroon-and-gray striped trees  
an eyesore, to say the least.
However, thats not the real crux 
of the problem. Eventually, if this 
moronic behavior continues, the 
paint will kill the trees. Already, 
with only sporadic painting, the 
center tree is dying.
And whats to stop the next group 
who really wants to grab our at.p,t pJRE uE tpIopEf pIhnJbM
Three dances are held October 
14 on a campus that rarely sup
ports one. Black students storm 
Student Affairs, complaining of 
campus insensitivity. The sorori
ties surprise many by withdraw
ing from the IFC.
Is it a coincidence that all three 
events have occurred in the last 
three months? All of them are 
examples of poor communication.
How many times has it seemed 
that things happen on campus by 
chance, or that programs are not 
coordinated among groups? The 
structure of the University, with 
six independent colleges, many 
autonomous clubs, nineteen Greek
- organizations, and other divisions 
of the campus, has allowed sub
groups to behave autonomously.
Diversity is one of Carnegie 
Mellons greatest strengths. Few 
schools of our size can boast as 
many talented people with differ
ent abilities. Unfortunately, this 
strength has also turned into a 
great weakness.
There are so many subgroups, 
that the only way people find out 
what others are up to is when they 
come in conflict with one another.
Not only is this a problem among 
students, but its a faculty and 
staff problem as well. This sum
mer, Public Relations asked people 
on campus if they felt they were 
adequately informed. Most were 
ambivalent, but one wrote, Sadly, 
the old boy network is the best 
way to get information hereEven 
if that impression is not true, it 
certainly is pervasive.
Some form of action must be 
taken to enhance the flow of com
munication on campus - PRs new 
8x11 News, bulletin boards, The 
Student Union and The Tartan 
will all play a role in this effort but 
other steps need to be taken.
First, Student Affairs and Stu
dent Activities can take a more 
active role in coordinating the 
activities of campus groups. This 
does not mean telling organiza
tions what they can and cant 
schedule. Instead, groups should 
become aware of the things that 
other organizations do so that they 
can complement the activities in
stead of compete with them.
Second, Warner Hall can open 
the lines of communication to the 
students and staff. Encourage ad
ministrators, faculty members, 
and staff to be open to questions. 
Many times we have encountered 
roadblocks in covering stories as 
reporters or gathering informa
tion as students.
Third, programs like the Human 
Relations Conference should be 
encouraged and enlarged. The 
recent outcry by black students 
once again illustrates the need we 
all have for better communication 
skills:talkingandlistening. Kudos 
to those who organized the confer
ence and we encourage as many 
people as possible to attend.
Were all stuck together in less 
than 100 acres. If we dont mix 
with one another, we will become 
less informed, less sensitive to 
peoples problems, and less of a 
campus. We all deserve better.

So whats the solution? By paint
ing the trees, the people who 
painted the Fence for Hoopla 88 
committed vandalism. They com
mitted a crime; they should be 
punished. At the very least, they 
should pay to have the paint 
removed before other organiza

Nocturnal painting parties at the

Editor:
The Tartan, in its editorial last week, 
referred to the concerns which have been 
raised by black students on campus as 
being sounds of the 60s. It went on to 
say that a number of racially offensive 
incidents which occurred on campus were 
minor and that the administration, 
faculty, and the students (were charged) 
with being racist.
From a personal standpoint I can say 
that I have found the administration 
and faculty to be much more aware of 
why certain incidents were racially of
fensive than were many students; the 
editor of The Tartan for example.
The issue is racial insensitivity and 
the evidence that the problem exists can 
be seen in many aspects of campus life:
It was insensitive for the Activities 
Board to show the film Birth of a Na
tion on Martin Luther Kings birthday 
and then be surprised when black stu
dents were offended. Birth of a Nation 
is a film which was done in blackface and 
glorifies the role of the Ku Klux Klan in 
liberating the south following the Civil 
War.
It was insensitive for the ATO frater
nity to wear the confederate flag and fail 
to realize what that flag represents to 
the black community.
It was insensitive for the Student Un
ion newspaper to publish a column which
EppEot pV p2E wfJpVo
referred to blacks as these swarthy types 
(as I assume theyd like to be called if 
they could spell it).
It was insensitive for Student Affairs 
to publish a poster entitled 31 Fun 
Things to do with a Great Tan using the 
Sambo caricature.
And the editor of The Tartan wonders 
why some black students feel uncomfort
able on campus?
When these examples of insensitivity 
are raised the automatic response seems 
to be that black students are paranoid, 
too sensitive, and are accusing the entire 
campus community of being racist. 
Rather than responding to the complaint 
about the timing of the Birth of a Na
tion movie, for example, an Activities 
Board representative wrote to The Tartan 
to say tha t the Activities Board was not 
racist. It had not been accused of being 
racist, it was accused of being insensi
tive. The writer did not even hint that he 
intended to be more sensitive about 
scheduling films in the future, much less 
the selection of the film in the first place, 
nor did he seem to even have a clue as to 
why anyone would be offended.
The problem of racial insensitivity is 
not a problem which is unique to the
campus of CMU. In the 1980s there seems 
to be a growing failure to understand 
why such racial slurs are offensive. There 
also seems to be an increased willing
ness to pretend that problems do not 
exist, to deny that there are legitimate 
concerns which should be addressed, and 
to avoid the issue of racial insensitivity 
by claiming that one is being accused of 
being a racist.
A persons motives cannot be known, 
but we can know what his actions are, 
how those actions are likely to be inter
preted, and the response which such 
actions are likely to engender from those 
who are on the receiving end. Somehow 
the spirit of the 80s does not seem to 
understand this.
Say what you will about the sixties, at 
least there were many people during the 
period who sought to call attention to 
large injustices and subtle offenses and 
who tried to work through some of the 
difficulties inherent in an ever changing 
and ever growing multiracial, multicul
tural society.
It may be that black students are act-1 
ing in the spirit of the sixties, as you have 
said. If that is true, it is a better spirit 
than the spirit of the eighties which 
prompted The Tartans editorial.

Editor:
The article entitled Black students 
protest insensitivity in the October 18 
issue of The Tartan describes the opposi
tion shown by some students toward the 
buggy Rebel Yell and toward the mem
bers of ATO wearing Confederate head
bands during sweepstakes. In the ar
ticle, the brothers of this fraternity were 
accused of being insensitive towards 
blacks and uneducated. This is sur
prising coming from a group attempting 
to prevent insensitivity caused by igno
rance of ethnic issues and ethnic groups. 
Before accusing others of being ignorant, 
perhaps they should educate themselves 
about the accusations they are making.
The confederate flag and the term 
rebel yell are not symbolic of racism 
nor do they represent any current at
tempt to deprive minorit is of their free
dom and ethnic heritage. On the con
trary, these symbols represent an ethnic 
heritage of their own, that of the South
ern American. South of the Potomac 
River, many honest, freedom-loving 
Americans proudly display the Confed
erate Flag. To them, it has many mean
ings: it represents a lifestyle, a dialect of 
the language, a type of music, and a 
relaxed attitude toward life, all charac
teristics of the South.
I am proud to be a Southerner, just as 
the black students on campus are proud 
to be black. There is no need for these two 
ethnic groups to be at odds with each 
other, but if they are, it has little to do 
with insensitivity and ignorance on 
the part of the Southerners. Many people 
think the Civil War was a slavery dis
pute. In fact, the issues at stake were 
much more complex, and the ethnic pride 
of the South was among them. General 
Robert E. Lee, who led the Confederate 
army into the war and today remains a 
symbol of Southern pride, was openly 
opposed to slavery. Herbert Saunders, a 
friend of General Lee, once wrote of him,
On the subject of slavery, he assured me 
that he had always been in favor of the 
emancipation of the negroes, and that in 
Virginia the feeling had been strongly 
inclining in the same direction. Slavery 
was a cruel, evil institution, and it is an 
embarrassing blotch on Southern his
tory. But all ethnic groups have had 
their bad points as well as their good 
ones. I was bom and raised in Richmond, 
Virginia, where a very detailed study of 
the Civil War (called The War Between 
the States in the South) is a regular part 
of public education. The White House of 
the Confederacy is one of many muse
ums and monuments that serve to re
mind and educate the visitor and 
Richmonder of the great men who fought 
for their state and their way of life in the 
1860s. Washington and Lee University 
in Lexington, Va., named after two proud 
Southerners, is among several fine edu
cational institutions that were founded 
on the principle of honor, integrity, and 
patriotism that characterize the South
ern ideal.
The soldiers who fought the war against
the Union had many reasons for going to 
battle, and patriotism was high among 
them. With all my devotion to the Union 
and the feeling of loyalty and duty of an 
American citizen, General Lee wrote to 
his sister in 1861, I have not been a 
to make up my mind to raise my hand 
against my relatives, my children, my\ 
home. I have therefore resigned my 
commission in the Army, and save in 
defense of my native State, with the 
sincere hope that my poor services may 
never be needed, I hope I may never be 
called on to draw my sword. 
Southerners are a peace-loving, proud 
ethnic group, and slavery is one scar on 
their history. The Confederate flag and 
the rebel yell are among the symbols of 
the Souths rich, exemplary heritage. 1^ 
agree that education about ethnic groups 
is sadly lacking throughout this diverse 
nation, and I hope this letter helps to 
clear up some of the issues that are 
involved.

Letter ignores issue of fetal rights
Editor:
I usually do not respond to the letters 
to the editor about my column. One round 
of debate is usually enough. However, 
when it comes to abortion, and my col
umn Fetal Dilemma (10/4), one round 
will not do this time.
In her response, Anti-abortion Argu
ment Flawed in Its Language (10/18), 
Anne-Marie Harvey accurately points 
out several problems in my article. I did 
indeed muddle my voice throughout the 
column. I will have to work on that; the 
active voice is always preferable to the 
passive one. Furthermore, I misplaced a 
modifier in my last sentence: By leaving 
that definition to the mother, millions of
mothers are erroneously deciding to let. 
their babies be killed. I meant to say: < 
By leaving that definition to the mother,; 
Mr. Dukakis, you are allowing millions; 
of mothers to erroneously decide to let; 
their babies be killed. I do appreciate 
Ms. Harveys comments (thank you AnneMarie), and I hope others who disagree 
with me will take the time to respond. 
After all, I write for The Tartan so that 1 
can receive criticism from others and, 
after learning, become a better writer.
I do hope, however, that by saying uIn 
Fetal Dilemma, Jeff Fartro sets himself 
up for criticism perhaps even more on 
the basis of his use of language than on

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  25 October 19889
I thought it appropriate that 
Cliffe Knechtle came to Carnegie 
jiiellon on October 12, two days 
after Columbus Day. In the eyes 
of history, Cliffe Knechtle and 
Christopher Columbus are more 
alike than you may think.
How are they alike? Well, they 
both had jobs that allowed them 
to travel a lot. Columbus sailed on 
four round-trip voyages across the 
Atlantic. Cliffe travels to roughly 
30 colleges and universities a year.
Both were Christians. Does that 
surprise you? You dont have to 
listen to Cliffe for too long before 
you realize what he believes. His 
message is simple: Im begging 
and pleading with you to accept 
Jesus Christ as you personal 
Savior and Lord.
Columbus faith may be less 
obvious. Unfortunately, modern 
secular historians choose to deemphasize, or worse yet comoJRE Ibf srbJt2REbp

pletely ignore, the faith of impor
tant historical people, so most 
people today dont understand 
that many great people were 
Christians  people like Blaise 
Pascal, Abraham Lincoln, Isaac 
Newton, and T.S. Eliot.
When we study the source texts 
 those historical documents 
which provide the primary infor
mation about the past  we 
quickly discover that Columbus 
was motivated by his Christian 
faith. Take, for example, this 
quote from his diary. He wrote 
this during one of his voyages: It 
was the Lord that put it into my 
mind...There is no question the 
inspiration was from the Holy 
Spirit because he comforted me
Can our philosophy towards law 
enforcement and punishment be 
changed so that crime is a less de
sirable occupation? What ap
proach should our prisons take to 
rehabilitating criminals presently 
serving time so that they can 
become productive members of 
our society?
Questions concerning crime 
control have appeared as a hot 
topic in the present Presidential 
campaign. We frequently hear fine 
tuned campaign rhetoric on sub
jects such as the death penalty, 
gun control, and furlough pro
grams.
The candidates positions on the 
death penalty are clear. George 
Bush supports it and Mike 
Dukakis is against it. George Bush 
argues that for some of the worst, 
violent crimes in our society, death 
is the only suitable punishment. 
Dukakis argues that the death 
penalty does not serve as a deter
rent to crime and is morally wrong. 
Recent statistics show that the 
death sentence, even when 
banded down, is rarely carried 
out and extremely costly to the 
American tax payer. Out of ap
proximately 20,000 death penalty 
sentences handed down in the
United --------------------------------------
States, only 
25 were car
ried out.
George Bush 
most likely 
emphasizes 
the death 
penalty as

buyer. Why is Bush against this? 
He is only pandering to the NRA 
faithful. A waiting period would 
not take guns away from lawabiding, responsible citizens. Re
publicans should open their ears 
to this message: If a seven day 
wait had been in place eight years 
ago, John Hinkley could not have 
purchased a gun on demand at a 
pawn shop and then proceed to 
shoot President Reagan and his 
press secretary James Brady.
The only real problem the Vice 
President could find in Governor 
Dukakis impressive record on 
crime, was the recently repealed 
Massachusetts furlough program. 
Dukakis has been blamed for an 
extremely open furlough program 
which allowed a prisoner named 
Willie Horton out on a two day 
pass which permitted him to rape 
and assault a Maryland couple. 
This charge is one of the many 
outrageous lies and inaccuracies 
of the George Bush campaign. 
First of all, Mike Dukakis was not 
the one to propose or approve the 
furlough program. A prior gover------------------------------ nor, the last
playing on the paranoia of the 
American people, politicians can 
look tough though their record 
iay show differently. Not only 
[are the legal costs of following 
hrough on a death penalty ex
tensive, the moral costs put our 
society in grave danger. By put
ting a criminal to death, the gov'rnment of the United States is 
laking the statement that killan individual for a crime he 
as committed is justifiable. If it 
justifiable for our government 
fo commit such an atrocity, then 
'by is it not justified for individuds to do so? For the more reliiious readers, the question to be 
isked is whether or not it is mans 
lace to. take away the gift of life, administration wanted to cut $65 
,r should we leave that to a higher million from a bill supporting the
Authority?
Gun Control is another freluently discussed campaign topic, 
george Bush often mentions his 
tfetime membership in the Naional Rifle Association (NRA)
|nd, like the NRA, opposes any experience in law enforcement 
i*mofgun control. Mike Dukakis policy while Mike Dukakis has 
in favor of certain measures increased the budget for law en
rich would keep guns out of the forcement, enlarged the police 
tends of known criminals as well force and reduced the crime rate

with rays of marvelous illumina
tion from the holy Scriptures... 
The gospel must be preached to so 
many lands in such a short time.
Consequently, both Cliffe and 
Columbus were pioneers, moti
vated by the gospel. Columbus 
sought to bring the gospel to new 
lands; Cliffe seeks to bring the 
gospel to new people, those in the 
land that Columbus discovered 
who have never heard it. Cliffe, 
like Columbus, lives his life posi
tively responding to the Great 
Commission Jesus gave  Go 
into the world with the good news 
to all creation.
Last, both were ridiculed for 
their actions. Columbus listened 
to an argument something like 
Youll fall off the end of the earth, 
Chris. The world is flat you see. 
But Columbus experience dem
onstrated that the world was not 
flat.
Cliffe, on the other hand, gets 
an objection like How can that 
guy say Jesus is the only way to 
heaven or I dont even believe 
that God exists. But the evidence 
 the Bible, the historical valid
ity of the Christian faith, its 
unique substitutional atonement 
message, and its power to explain 
the world around us  suggests 
that God does indeed exists and 
that Jesus is God.
People laughed at Columbus for 
his faith, and they laugh at Cliffe 
too. Columbus demonstrated that 
they were wrong. Cliffe demon
strates, by using historical evi
dence, that the evidence suggests 
Christianity is correct.
Do you see the irony? We com
memorated Columbus, a histori
cal figure who had almost identi
cal goals as Cliffes, two days be
fore Cliffe came here to be ridi
culed for living out those very 
same goals.

Special agenda classes wont solve 
minority problems, misunderstandings
The lead story in last weeks 
Tartan mentioned a letter 
signed by 160 students who seek 
the addition of classes and texts 
to the relevant history courses, 
that support their social agenda. 
Apparently they believe the 
creation of these classes and 
inclusion of these unnamed 
texts in the relevant history 
courses will be a step towards 
solving the racial problems that 
these students perceive on 
campus.
This is just the latest example 
of a common misuse of classes 
at Carnegie Mellon. Professors 
and graduate students see the 
courses they teach as a tool to 
support the spread of their 
particular philosophies. Now 
campus special interest groups 
want a piece of the action. Like 
professors, they feel that by 
regulating course content they 
can bring about the social 
changes on their agenda. Core 
courses are particularly soughtafter targets since they provide 
the largest audience.
The practice of including per
sonal agendas entirely defeats 
the purpose of the core curricu
lum. As 60 Coarse stated last 
week, core courses should be 
used to present a common base 
of knowledge and a wide range 
of opinions. By pushing a par
ticular philosophical or politi
cal viewpoint, professors under
mine this goal.
This is particularly evident 
in literature courses. Often, a 
professor will push his or her 
personal agenda to the point 
where it conflicts with the stated 
purpose of the course. When 
this occurs, or when the choice 
of material is made to lead stu
dents to a certain conclusion, 
the course becomes a tool of
/) VIotE 
yJd2IEh COO CoVrp
propaganda rather than knowl
edge.
Other courses more subtly go 
about their goal of pushing par
ticular agendas. The choice of 
reading material may be polemi
cal. Simple texts that support the 
professors viewpoint may be 
chosen, while the texts selected 
that contradict this viewpoint may 
be stylistically more difficult, thus 
creating an unconscious bias. This 
is an extremely subtle way of 
getting the students to agree with 
the professors ideas. All of these 
techniques push the professors 
agenda at the students expense. 
The goal of broad-based knowl
edge is sacrificed.
As a corollary to this, special 
interests want courses created 
that will push their agendas. And 
I do not think that the 160 stu
dents who signed the petition 
mentioned above would be satis
fied with the simple creation of 
these courses. They would want 
everyone to take them, probably 
for their own good. I remember 
a similar occurrence last year 
when the Student Union came 
out recommending that a course 
in Gender Studies be required 
for all students. Fortunately, the 
faculty did not cave into this 
demand as it would have opened 
a Pandoras box of special inter
est groups pushing for courses to 
push their agendas.
These groups believe that their 
agendas are important. We need 
to have a black studies course to 
promote understanding. Well how 
about an Asian studies course 
also? There are plenty of Asians
at CMU. What about a Native 
American studies course? Or 
perhaps Eskimo studies? Slov
enian studies? Transylvanian 
studies? What about other mi
norities? I believe that our cam
pus is not enough aware of 
the great contributions made 
by and the problems facing 
people who listen to seventies 
disco music and wear blinking 
chest medallions. You have to 
admit it, the CMU campus is 
not very aware of these people 
and their special problems; they 
certainly experience prejudice, 
just as do women, blacks, and 
homosexuals. So lets have a 
class that addresses the issues 
of this minority.
As you can see, the policy of 
creating and requiring every
one to take a course tailored to 
any one special interest group 
is impractical and foolish. 
Where exactly do you draw the 
line on who to study?
Intelligent and educated 
people can make decisions for 
themselves and are much more 
likely to take these decisions to 
heart than people who have 
been force-fed a particular phi
losophy. Professors and special 
interest groups should have 
enough faith in the basic truth 
of their philosophy to let it sink 
or swim on its own. Trust in 
John Stewart Mills belief that 
in an environment of free dis
cussion and inquiry, incorrect 
ideas will be discounted and 
the truth will assert itself. Give 
students a broad education and 
they will make the correct deci
sions for themselves without 
being told what to think.

Central America is a paradox. 
It is a region rich in resources, 
without massive overpopulation 
but with desperate poverty. Symp
toms of Central Americas deeprooted poverty are often in our 
news: the debt crisis, illegal im
migration from the region, and 
the brutal wars of revolution and 
counter-revolution. The US role 
in this paradox is important, but 
to understand it requires a sense 
of the historical development in 
order to decipher the news. The

Nicaragua was much like the 
rest of Central America until 1979 
when Nicaraguans deposed Anastasio Somoza Debayle, the dicta
tor. But the problem of poverty 
went deeper than just one man 
rule. The system of land tenure 
was the major reason that most

people were poor in both Nicara
gua and El Salvador. In El Salva
dor all the land worth owning, 
that is, all the land that will grow 
coffee, was and is owned by 
roughly 2% of the population. In 
Nicaragua by 1979 the rulers 
family alone owned about 40% of 
the land. Peasants either owned 
or rented small plots of land or 
else worked on the plantations 
for what would charitably, be 
described as slave-wages. Both 
countries functioned as de facto 
colonies, with exports of raw 
materials and imports of finished 
goods overseen by a landed elite, 
justified by a conservative Catho
lic church and protected by a US 
supplied and trained military best 
described as brutal.
The army and the US govern
ment supplied the most impor
tant support for this system of 
land tenure: brute force. If grass
roots protests reached a level that 
the local military couldnt handle, 
US soldiers could be counted on to 
intervene. After the Vietnam W ar, 
the Pentagon preferred to pro
vide these countries with the 
necessary material and training 
to preserve the status quo with
out the presence of US troops.
This reluctance to intervene did 
not bother earlier US Presidents. 
Woodrow Wilson sentUS Marines 
to Nicaragua in 1912, and they 
werent pulled out until 1934. The 
Marines only left then after the 
last threat to US control, the rebel 
leader Augusto Sandino, was 
killed by Anastasio Garcia So
moza. However, US troops did 
return to Nicaragua as late as the 
1970s. Somoza paid the State 
Department back by keeping US 
investments safe, and adopting 
an unreserved pro-US line in 
international affairs. The State 
Department turned a blind eye to 
human rights abuses, adopting 
the attitude in effect that So
moza may be a son-of-a-bitch, but 
hes our son-of-a-bitch.
El Salvadors elites required 
fewer US troops, and their poli
cies were even more brutal than 
Somozas. In 1932, coffee prices 
had tumbled, and many planta
tion workers were starving. When
workers marched to dramatize 
their plight, the military gunned 
down 30,000.
As might be imagined, non-vio
lent protest had a short lifespan 
in these countries. Most elections 
were no more meaningful, and 
considerably less fair, than elec
tions of American high school 
homecoming queens. In El Salva
dor and pre-1979 Nicaragua, po
litical or economic dissent was 
discouraged through the use of 
terror tactics. Salvadoran tradeunionists were often found in the 
city dump with their genitalia 
stuffed in their mouths.
The US government supported 
these regimes as long as their 
investment climate remained 
healthy. As a response to the 
appeal of Fidel Castros revolu
tion in Cuba, beginning in the 
1960s, the US pumped USAID 
monies and Peace Corps volun
teers into the region, ostensibly 
to help the poor pull themselves 
up by their bootstraps. The prob
lem was, no US government was 
willing to hand out boots. No US 
government challenged the local 
system of land tenure.
Since 1981, US policy has been 
to subsidize our friends and pun
ish our enemies. The tab for our 
governments support for El Sal
vador current runs about $500 m. 
a year. Congress allocates any
where between $30 to 100M to 
supply the resistance to the new 
government in Nicaragua. Ameri
can taxpayers also have under
written the massive loans made 
to countries such as El Salvador, 
as our government bails out banks 
whose bad loans in Latin Amer
ica outweigh their assets. The! 
chief advantage to North Ameri-: 
cans as a whole are cheap prices 
on coffee and bananas.
The US will continue to support 
its friends and punish its ene
mies. Unfortunately, these 
friends are corrupt and brutal; 
Both the Contras and the Salva
doran government have an abys
mal record of human rights 
abuses. Their enemies are the poor 
who will no longer remain quiet; 
Why should the poor be our enecontinued on page 11

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  25 October 1988
eprfEbp eEbIpVo dhIoJFJEt 2Jt VssVtJpJVb pV MIT oJM2pt VofJbIbdE lEpV
Editor:
In his article concerning An
drew Robitsheks veto of Student 
Senates Gay Rights Resolution, 
Karl Barnhart states, [Matthew] 
Ruben claims Robitshek vetoed 
the resolution because of a per
gonal bias against gays. This 
claim I supposedly made was a 
paraphrase: it did not appear as a 
quote for the simple reason that I 
never said it.
What I did relate to Mr. 
Barnhart were the facts that led 
jne to question some Senators  
nd Mr. Robitshek  about what 
hey were actually objecting to 
yvhen they opposed passage of the 
esolution. The omission of these 
facts has compromisedjny^integnty. Hopefully tKe following will 
help remedy the situation.
First: the Student Government 
Constitution forbids the recogni
tion [and thus funding] of organi
sations which discriminate in 
Membership on the basis of race, 
reed, color, religious or political 
persuasion, sexual orientation, or 
lational origin. When sexual ori
entation was added to the list, 
then-Senator Andrew Robitshek 
voted against it.
Second: Robitshek writes in his 
eto, It would be an unfortunate 
irecedent for the Senate to start
ihIdnt uIbp EkrIh oJM2pt and more
EppEot pV p2E wfJpVo
making resolutions or rules with
out having all the facts in front of 
them. Maybe so, but last year 
Senate funded an organization 
for buggy, and to this day no one 
is sure of this organizations offi
cial purpose outside of Sweep
stakes; Mr. Robitshek declined to 
veto in this case. Two weeks ago 
Senate allocated six-hundred 
dollars in advertising funds to 
students building an outdoor arts 
pavilion; great project, but even 
the students working on it have 
no idea how it will proceed; Mr. 
Robitshek declined to veto. Last 
year Senate passed a resolution 
supporting CMUs divestment 
from South Africa; noble cause, 
but no one demanded a copy of 
CMUs investment policy or stock 
portfolio; Mr. Robitshek declined 
to veto. Also last year, Senate 
passed a resolution recognizing 
International Womens Day, while 
no one knew exactly what 
Womens Day entailed; Mr. Ro
bitshek declined to veto. So when 
Mr. Robitshek claims he wants to 
avoid a precedent being set, we 
must realize that the practice of
deciding without having all the 
facts in front of [us] has been 
ongoing, and that Mr. Robitshek 
has never attempted to curb it 
until now.
Third: at the Senate meeting 
two weeks ago, a Senator objected 
to being accused of fear, saying 
that he had a responsibility to 
vote on the opinions of his con
stituents, many of whom oppose 
gay rights. Putting aside the 
merits of this argument, the only 
occasions on which this senator 
has invoked such principles have 
been during debates on the Gay 
Rights Resolution, and on GALAs 
budget last Spring. Quite an inter
esting pattern.
The facts contained in the last 
three paragraphs compelled me 
to put forth the arguments that I 
did. Others may have reached 
different conclusions from the 
same information, but you never 
gave them the chance to decide, 
Mr. Barnhart. Why did you not 
cite Robitsheks past voting and 
vetoing records? Why did you 
exclude the aforementioned 
Senators pattern of objecting to 
gay-related issues in Senate? You 
interviewed him, yet he is not 
mentioned in your article at all. 
You chose instead to print your 
own version of what I was think
I grew up knowing few blacks. 
)uring the six years that I was in 
high school most of what I learned 
about blacks and race issues came 
from television or newspapers.
Like most whites I thought that 
blacks and other minorities sim
ply wanted to be equal. And I 
thought equality meant doing 
things whites could do: going to 
the same schools, living in the 
jame neighborhoods, having the 
same opportunities, and getting 
the same respect as whites.
But Ive slowly come to realize 
hat there is more to it than that, 
had been expecting blacks to 
five up their culture to become 
/hite and thats what I called inegration. While I always knew I 
wasnt a racist, I suddenly discov
ered that I was biased when it 
iame to culture.
Which is why I am extremely 
nterested in hearing Donald 
Poods speak at tomorrows AB 
cture. Woods was a newspaper 
jditor in South Africa and a friend 
ifblack leader Stephen Biko. The 
itory of their friendship and of 
likos murder by South African 
security forces was dramatized in 
lie recent film Cry Freedom.
In his youth, Woods had the 
ame feelings toward blacks that 
pany pro-apartheid South Afriins had, but by the time he had 
lecome a journalist, he was callng for a progressive dismantlewoJd vO ErhJEppE
ment of the laws which form 
apartheid.
When he first heard of Biko and 
the Black Consciousness move
ment he led, Woods resented his 
efforts. Biko seemed to be encour
aging an all-black organization, 
which conflicted with Woodss 
efforts in desegregation, such as 
in sports and public places.
But when Woods met the charasmatic Biko, he slowly began to 
understand his efforts with the 
Black Consciousness movement. 
Biko was attempting to educate 
blacks about their culture and 
reestablish pride in their race. He 
did not want to be patemalized by 
whites, whether they were liberal 
or conservative..
Blacks had to have separate 
organizations to develop the po
litical skills which they would 
need to run their own country, 
Biko contended. If they worked 
completely with whites, then the 
whites would continue to call the 
shots because they would be more 
articulate and better educated.
Since coming to college I have 
realized that minorities do have 
more needs than simply equal 
opportunities. They want to learn 
about their own cultural history 
and have a different set of tastes,

iat she resorts to the lowest form

my style. Rather than analyze 
iy thesis, The issue of abortion 
really not one of choice, but,

By refusing to examine the quesn, Is the fetus a person? Ms.

a pretty strong stomach to accept 
the fact that many abortions are 
carried out by the insertion of an 
instrument into the womb, and 
the pulling out of separate bits of 
baby at each insertion. Not nice, 
really: first an arm, then a leg,

ing. If I had simply wanted to ac
cuse Mr. Robitshek, as your ar
ticle implies, I would have walked 
into your office, shouted a bit, and 
walked out. You and I both know 
that for at least one half hour I 
attempted to explain to you why I 
reacted the way I did during the 
debate. However, while 
Robitsheks official explanation 
makes up your storys largest 
paragraph, and is supported with 
quotes from himself and the Chair 
of Senate, my side is represented 
with one paraphrased sentence. 
Your justification? That [the 
paraphrased statement] is basi
cally what you were saying to 
me. That, Mr. Barnhart, is not 
good reporting. It is surmising 
without authority. It is editorial
izing under the guise of present
ing unbiased news. It is horrible 
journalism.
In a similar vein, Dave Levy 
sacrifices journalistic quality 
when he trains his sights on me in 
Fear Tactics... He claims that 
Senators should not have to admit 
their personal fears in public. Un
fortunately, Mr. Levy, those same 
fears tend to affect our voting on
almost any issue; when they in
fluence voting, they affect the 
student body, and students thus 
deserve to know about their Sena
tors motivational mindsets. No 
Senator denied that s/he trusted 
assurances that the ordinance our 
resolution supports simply adds 
sexual orientation to race, gen
der, etc. in the current anti-discrimination code. No one said s/ 
he disagreed with the concept of 
an anti-discrimination code. No 
one distrusted Senator Jainchill 
when he promised that the reso
lution would not be sent to City 
Council unless Senators agreed 
that the ordinance was indeed 
what we had represented it to be. 
Finally, no one who said s/he did 
not have enough information 
chose the logical alternative of 
abstaining during the vote. In the 
context of these events and Stu
dent Senates normal operating 
procedures, What are you really 
objecting to? was a perfectly valid 
question.
In fact, I doubt whether even 
you, Mr. Levy, really disagree with 
my actions. After all, you con
demn what I did in a discussion
forum where people could unmet 
diately reply, but in your article 
go on to question my motives* 
leavingme unable to respond until 
the next issue of the newspaper. I 
suppose you want your hypocrisy 
to be hidden along with everyone 
elses fear?
Finally, I must pose one last 
question to Mr. Barnhart, and to 
the University community. Being 
Editor-in-Chief, Mr. Barnhart] 
you are not a regular news writer 
who has to accept assignments* 
So why did you volunteer for, or 
accept, an assignment that re-; 
quired you to be objective about a; 
personal friend who was undeii 
fire in a controversial situation?, 
You willingly engaged in a con-! 
flict of interest, and it shows; thus
 to borrow from Mr. Levys ar
ticle  youve made it harder for 
others to trust you.
And if you cant be trusted as a; 
journalist, Mr. Barnhart, how can; 
you be trusted at all?

Editor:
I would like to thank Professor 
Glymour for his response to 60 
Coarse [H&SS students under
fed when it comes to philoso
phy,10/11]. He raises several 
good points and definitely makes 
a case for including mathematics 
in the Philosophic Methods and 
Morals core course. However, I 
disagree with a few of the points 
he makes in his letter.
In defending the mathematical 
study of philosophy, Professor 
Glymour notes that Hobbes 
would have wanted to have our 
understanding of computability 
and bounded rationality. Agreed. 
However, students taking PM&M 
will not know why Hobbes would 
want this, they will only know 
Hobbes as Calvins tiger. This is 
the particular danger in includ
ing only state-of-the-art research, 
the student does learn why this 
research is important, why it is 
an achievement.
To directly compare philosophy 
to physics is stretching a point; 
and inferring that the research 
conducted at CMU is the culmi
nation of 2000 years of philoso
phy is not accurate. One of the 
culminations, yes, the culmina
tion, no. Bounded rationality is a 
fascinating and important con
cept, but it does not touch on 
philosophical issues in aesthet
ics, politics, and personal conduct 
discussed by Plato, Mill, Hobbes, 
Nietzche and others.
Professor Glymours suggestion 
of a course in which the history of 
western thought would be dis
cussed is taken up with excite
ment and total support. Perhaps 
the English, History, and Philoso
phy departments could work to
gether to create such a course. I 
would be first in line to register 
for it. I would like to suggest that 
the Philosophy department take 
the lead in bringing about the 
creation of this course. Just its 
availability could go a long way 
towards the creation of the broad 
base of knowledge that an edu
cated individual needs.

Editor:
Congratulations on your edi
torial on CMU Dining Services. 
Im a junior, and it seems as 
though during my 2-1/2 years 
here, with the exception of the 
new oven at MorePizza, the 
quality and quantity of the food 
on campus has been in a steady 
decline.
Where to eat on campus is a 
constant dilemma. Morewood 
Gardens is overpriced, and even 
if you did have money left while 
using a meal, the potato chips 
sold last year are gone, and you 
can no longer get an ice cream 
slip worth more than one ice 
cream. Now you must get your 
ice cream with your meal and 
let it melt.
MorePizza is all right except 
for late night when getting a 
small pepperoni pizza on con
tract doesnt let you get any
thing to drink. However, you 
can share a large pepperoni 
pizza with somebody, and still 
get two liters of soda. What are 
they sayingyour punishment 
for eating alone is to die of thirst?
I also feel that MorePizzas lack 
of delivery service to University 
off-campus housing is extremely 
unfair; if anything, we who live in 
off-campus housing are the ones 
that need delivery the mostnot 
those a five minute walk away.
The Tartan Grill consists of 
lines. It might be one long line 
when there is no line leader, or 
two shorter lines if there is one. 
The servers usually only listen to 
one item that you want, go get it, 
and then come back to hear the 
next one. A pad of paper might 
shorten four trips down to one. 
The price changes are also unfair 
since the meal allowance did not 
increase enough to cover the in
crease in food prices. I can no 
longer receive for a meal what I 
did last year. Fm sure that food 
prices increased, but then again 
so did our meal contracts. 
Shouldnt that cover it?
And then theres Kiltie. At a 
typical trip to Kiltie, you are sure 
to find at least one of the follow
ing:
1. The entree listed is either 
not really there or they
have run out of it.
2. No trays
3. No silverware
4. No juice
5. No bowls for ice cream
6. No salad at the salad bar
7. Solid yogurt
8. A temperature of 32 de
grees
Kiltie is a favorite for many 
people only because it is all you 
can eat. Unfortunately, going 
there has turned into more of 
an adventure: Who can actu
ally eat an enjoyable and filling 
meal without having to eat 5 
bowls of cereal?
I dont think that we students 
want all that much out of Din
ing Service. All we ask is that 
the food and silverware are 
there, the servers serve the food 
as fast as possible, and that we 
can eat enough using one con
tract meal to go away feeling 
full. And please, turn the air 
conditioning down in Kiltie!

Some random thoughts about 
Senate:
 Last weeks meeting in Room
13 was great. It was more homey 
and you could tell who the execu
tives were. I liked the cramping 
without the desk because the 
Senate generally relaxes behind 
their tables with papers spread 
out to look important. This way 
you could tell when people were 
really looking at papers not just 
shuffling them for effect.
 I also like the minutes more 
this week because motions are 
being placed inside them again. It 
makes it easier for those who dont 
go to know whats going on.
 I like the taping of minutes. It 
makes it easier for publications to 
get quotes right.
 I do have one problem with 
the minutes though. I still would 
like to know what goes on in Points 
ofDiscussion. Sometimes this part 
of the meeting can be longer than 
the Internal Committee reports.
 I like Senate Happy Hours. I 
dont go to them anymore, but its 
a good idea.
 I dont understand why Sen
ate hasnt come up with a good 
way to deal with ex-officios yet. I 
thought they had it when Senate 
was going to SDC but I guess 
something changed during the 
week because SDC is still going to 
Senate.
 Now that Senate has changed
gElEo wbfJbM epVoT 
CIlJf gO ElT
the name of the Greek ex-officio 
seat to the Greek Council, how 
will they get them to show up past 
the first two times?
 Speaking of ex-officio seats, 
did anyone ask Student Ombuds
man Michael Murphy ifhe wanted 
to be an ex-officio? If the amend
ment goes through and he be
comes an ex-officio member of 
Senate, Id like to say that well 
miss you in the peanut gallery.
 Why is Audience Participa
tion at the beginning of meet
ings? What if you come up with a 
good idea in the middle? I know 
you can shoot your mouth off at 
any time by raising your hand, 
but not everyone else knows. How 
about a little do nothing section 
right before points ofDiscussion? 
Itll only make the Senate Min
utes a coupla lines longer and 
you might get some good input.
 What happened to the guys 
who were videotaping Senate last 
semester? Did they run out of 
cash? manpower? I think we 
should find out. Having Senators 
watch themselves on tape could 
do two things. One, they might 
see how pompous theyre getting 
and remember to keep is simple.
Or they could take even more; 
time.
 I like motions to limit debate.; 
Matt Ruben did a good thing to; 
propose a limit, considering how i 
much they had talked about it  
before. The funny part is that by ; 
the time someone proposes a limit; 
on the debate its too late.
 I keep going back to the min-; 
utes: what happened to the time I 
when the meeting is adjourned? ! 
Are you guys afraid that if people ! 
know how long the meetings last,  
no one will ever show up again? 
 A suggestion to Senate which ; 
I thought about after talking with ; 
Public Relations Chairperson ; 
Karen Pavlosky last week: a Sen- ; 
ate Historian. A lot has changed ! 
in the past two years. Imagine ! 
how much has changed in ten. '
 This is the last thing.Im going < 
to say and it is quite strange, so ; 
prepare yourselves. What does ; 
everybody think about a bi-cam- ; 
eral student government? I think ; 
it would be interesting if Senate, I 
which is really a House of Repre- ! 
sentatives, also had a second body ' 
of one member per department, j 
Its not really possible because ; 
its hard enough to get people to ; 
run for the present Student Sen- ; 
ate, but you never know.

Prepare yourself: Caan and 
Pat in kin in Alien Nation
By DAWN BROSONSKI
Tartan Staffwriter
Prepare yourself.
That is the one-liner used as a description for Twentieth Cen
tury Foxs latest science fiction film, Alien Nation. I was pre
pared for anything, except for a film that made me feel like a few 
pages from the script were missing.
The film takes us neither far, far away nor far, far into the fu
ture. The setting is Los Angeles, 1991, three years after a UFO 
landed on Earth with members of a race genetically engineered 
for slave labor. With no way to return home, the aliens were kept 
in quarantine and have just recently been released and wel
comed into society as equals. They were, in their words, given 
ownership of their lives for the first time.
Of course not everyone is overjoyed at the prospect of sharing 
their planet with the aliens, who are known as Slaggs, or NewComers. One such individual is Matthew Sykes, a detective ser
geant on the LAPD, played by James Caan. When a NewComer 
is murdered by members of his own race, Sykes partner is killed 
in the arrest attempt. Sykes hatred for the NewComers is tested 
when he volunteers to investigate a murder of a NewComer with 
one of the aliens, Detective Samuel (George) Francisco, warmly 
portrayed by Mandy Patinkin.
Terence Stamp is NewComer William Harcourt, the resident 
villan, whom we unfortunately do not learn very much about in 
this film. Sykes and George must confront him when he grossly 
manipulates a deadly secret that could threaten the NewCom
ers existence on Earth. This is the major plot twist of the film, 
one of the few that wasnt totally predictable and about the only 
intriguing one, so I wont ruin the much needed suspense here.
This film spends too much time with a murder investigation 
that, on the whole, would be no different if it were simply two 
humans doing the work. The alien race learns and adapts 
quickly, so they behave almost exactly like humans which is one 
of the troubling aspects of this film. It would have been much 
more interesting to have the aliens express dramatic differences 
from humans. They closely resemble humans physically aside 
from the different shapes of their faces and their total absence 
of hair. Instead of hair, the NewComers have a random mottled 
pattern that covers the skull. I was not very concerned with the 
investigation, but I wanted to know more about the NewComers.
Alien Nation was saved from its weak dialogue and predict
able plot twists by the light-hearted comedy that arises from the 
relationship between Syke and George, similar to that of Isaac 
Asimovs Elijah Baley and R. Daneel Olivaw, as the two gain 
respect for each other in the course of the investigation. Though 
their differences are resolved a little too quickly, Sykes and 
George play off each other wonderfully. One exceptional scene in 
the film depicts the two getting drunk (NewComer poison is 
fermented milk).
The final confrontation added to Caans and Patinkins per
formances and is enough reason to see this movie. Alien Nation 
is by no means a bad film, just one that left me feeling like a few 
pages of detail about a potentially fascinating alien race were 
ripped out of the script, and I desperately wanted them replaced.
Alien Nation is playing at the Manor Theater in Squirrel Hill.
oIRI soEtEbpt The Crucible
LAURA McILRATH
Staffwriter
I The production of The Crucible 
urrently being staged in the 
iresge theater does not attempt 
o remove the story from its litral setting as has been done in 
he past. It is conservative, stickngto the ideas that are contained 
rithin the script and not attemptng to bring in others. But in spite 
if this, or perhaps because of it, 
he show is energetic and powerill, and the ideas that are conained in it can not be ignored.
An insert in the program reads 
The urge to hunt witches...has 
ieen revived on a colossal scale. 
Tie themes that the play deals 
vith are universal, and in resistng the temptation to draw a 
larallel with the McCarthy trials 
f the 50s (which were going on 
vhen the play was first produced), 
lirector Derek Campbell is deny
ing us an easy out. Indeed, Tituba, a slave from Barbados 
played exquisitely by Allegra di 
Carpegna, recalls some problems 
that are still with us. She is sus
pect because she sings strange 
songs and is tempted by the devil 
to kill her master and fly home to 
the islands. This recalls modern 
ethnocentricity and the danger 
involved in not happily submit
ting to the dominant culture, right 
or wrong. The play is not about 
society in the 50s any more than 
it is about society in the 1690s. It 
is about both, and it is about any 
other restrictive society as well.
The second half of the play is 
when it really gets moving, not 
only because of the progression of 
the hysteria and desperation of 
the characters, but because it is 
in the courtroom where the paral
lels between seventeenth century 
Salem and twentieth century 
America are most apparent.
Deputy-Governor Danforth, 
played by Charles Legget, is as 
smooth and professional a politi
cian as any alive today, so much 
so that the honest and well-meaning Reverend Hale (Dennis Rees) 
doesnt stand a chance.
Most of the main problems with 
the show are likely to be remedied 
soon. John Kozeluh as John Proc
tor had some trouble with his 
lines, and a phone rang backstage 
at the beginning of an intimate 
scene between Proctor and his 
wife. The set, which was appro
priately plain but a little un
wieldy, took a bit of effort to rear
range between acts. The lighting 
was dim and evocative, but it was 
a bit annoying when characters 
stepped into shadows.
Overall, the cast handled the 
play very well, and the fact that it 
was not removed from its original 
context did make the production 
more effective. The hymns played
before each scene took on an eerie 
quality, and there was no Puritan 
reserve on the part of the charac
ters. They were blunt and deter
mined, sometimes even violent, 
and there were frequent moments 
when the audience gasped or 
whispered (and you thought Pu
ritans were dull...). Our sympa
thy as an audience was engaged, 
and that is the first step towards 
identification. Hopefully it was 
not just me who had a moments 
thoughtfulness when before the 
acts both the audience and the 
stage were briefly lit identically, 
as if there were no difference.

fecial to the Tartan
Homecoming weekend this year 
as a special one for Carnegie 
lellons Music Department as it 
lebrated its 75th anniversary 
ith concerts and receptions for 
arge alumni crowds. An alumni 
inner Friday evening followed 
y a gala concert by the Carnegie 
lellon Philharmonic and Chorus 
gan the festivities which connued all weekend. As a critic it 
wise to remain separate from 
erformances one reviews, but 
ride in the music department to 
(hich I belong forces me to talk 
out the performances that ocrred this weekend.
Soloists in Fridays concert inuded fifteen alumni vocalists in 
[orgeous performance with the 
rchestra of Ralph Vaughan 
Williams Serenade to Music. 
iobert Page, who returned to 
aching in the department this 
ear, conducted that work and 
hichester Psalms by Bernstein, 
he second movement of the 
salnis, beginning with a beauti
fy performed duet between 
arP and boy soprano, was an
ther of the many highlights of 
evening. Samuel Jones conucted the orchestral part of the 
rgram, including Wagners 
verture toDieMeistersingers and 
le Handel Concerto Grosso from 
kxanders Feast. Members of the 
uarteto Latinoamericano were 
foists in the latter work and 
emnstrated what wonderful 
musicians they are by injecting 
esh, youthful exuberance into 
jusic two and a half centuries 
The final work on the 
rgram, The Tenderland Suite 
y Aaron Copland, was a personY loving experience, especially 
the last movement when the
chorus joined the orchestra with 
the words the promise of living, 
the joy of Thanksgiving. Alumni 
tenor soloist Martin Doner (who 
sang a lead in a production of the 
Tenderland here as a student) 
sang the first lines alone, and 
when the chorus joined it gave me 
(and others who performed) a 
feeling as stirring as the final 
movement of the Beethoven Ninth 
Symphony. Performing can be a 
truly magical experience, and 
concerts like the one on Friday 
are what makes being a musician 
worth all the long hours in a 
practice room alone. The large 
audience for the concert (it filled 
the orchestra level and most of 
the first balcony of Carnegie Hall) 
was extremely appreciative, call
ing out conductor Samuel Jones 
for bows several times after the 
Copland.
Saturday was an opportunity 
for the departments jazz groups 
to show alumni their work. Mark
Burnell (Carnegie Mellon 78) 
directed the Jazz Choir in several 
tight-sounding numbers to begin 
the show. The performance of the 
ten-person vocal ensemble was 
marred only by the wretched 
acoustics of the gymnasium which 
washed out some of the excellent 
sound that they produced. A short 
jam session by alumni includ
ing Joe Negri, Randy Purcell, Jack 
Purcell, Carl McVicker and Mark 
Burnell formed the middle of the 
program and connected well with 
the audience, made up mostly of 
alumni. The Jazz Ensemble, di
rected by Randy Purcell (Carne
gie Mellon -68) finished the pro
gram with a bang, forcing some of 
the more timid alumni to cover 
their ears. A terrific sax front 
line, great solos from several 
students, including Mark Snyder, 
John Polinski and Ian Gordon, 
and some mean lead trumpet 
playing (I think about as loud and 
high as is humanly possible) from
Joe Perrino made the show a tough 
one to leave. Carnegie Mellon 
students get a second chance to 
hear the Jazz Ensemble in a con
cert this Wednesday at 7:30 in 
Alumni Concert Hall, College of 
Fine Arts.
Alumni were pleased with the 
concerts this weekend and many 
remarked at the recent return of 
the Music Department to the high 
quality that was once taken for 
granted here.
Enthusiasm and pride within 
the department has not, at least 
in the last four years, been any 
stronger, as could be seen last 
Wednesday night when approxi
mately forty to forty-five students 
painted the fence to advertise 
the weekends concerts. With any 
luck, more students in the uni
versity community will discover 
what wonderful music they are 
missing - especially considering 
all concerts presented by the de
partment are free!
Jr. Rep. presents Lysistrata
By STEPHANIE REEDY
Tartan Staffwriter
Lysistrata, an ancient Greek 
comedy by Aristophanes, will be 
performed as the third play in the 
Junior Repertory season at the 
Studio Theater this week. The 
story of the play deals with the 
war between Athens and Sparta, 
and the ultimatum the soldiers 
wives make to their husbands: 
they vow to never have sex with 
them again unless they cease 
fighting and make a treaty.
This weeks production will have 
a twist to it, however. Director 
David Korish has updated the 
play and has set it in 1970, in 
Washington D.C. It deals with 
the womens liberation move
ment, a march on Washington,
and a takeover of the Washington 
Monument.
Kena Dorsey will play Lysis
trata in this broad comedy that 
will include music from the 60s. 
Because it is geared to a modern 
time period, Lysistrata should 
prove both funny and entertain
ing. According to Robert Cucuzza,; 
who will play the Commissioner 
in the production, Lysistrata 
promises to be very 
funny...without a doubt.
Lysistrata will be performed at 
the Studio Theater on campus 
Tuesday at 5 pm and 8:30 pm,' 
and Wednesday at 6 pm. All per
formances are free and open to 
the CMU public. The Studio 
Theater is located in the grey: 
building directly behind CFA; 
right across from the Gym.

Time once again for the big 
hoohaw State Fair of Texas, which 
attracts 48 million people a year 
from all known planets in the 
universe to watch guys with no 
teeth grab greased piglets by the 
hind legs and throw em through a 
flaming hoop to win twenty bucks 
to get drunk on. Its great.
For those of you in other 
states who never got to go 
to the State Fair of Texas, 
and wonder why theres an 
enormous void in your life, 
heres just a few of the 
things that make it differ
ent from every other fair in Amerreservation, who changes expres
sions twice a day and occasionally 
keels over dead when a fat guy 
talks about the one hundred years 
of shame, exploitation and agony 
etched into every line on his face.

Speaking of disgusting 
spectacles, Elvira and her 
two enormous talents 
came out with a movie 
last week about a simple 
young girl whose ambition in life 
is to paste whirlybirds on her 
breasts and do the double-windmill, flying-tassel, bouncing-bazooma Vegas showgirl routine 
popularized by Virginia Bell, the 
finest stripper in the history of 
Cincinnati. (Virginia receives no 
credit on the movie, by the way.) 
Anyhow, to get the fifty thou she 
needs to pay the Flamingo Hotel 
to put her onstage, Elvira has to 
prove she can do more than walk 
around like a tube of Elmers Glue 
thats cracked down the front. For
tunately, she inherits a house 
thats haunted by character ac
tors, where she can live with her 
punk-rock poodle and whoever 
drops by to stare at her cleavage.
After a while they throw some 
plot in about a demon recipe book 
full of casseroles that have intes
tines and teeth, and the evil uncle 
thats trying to get the book so he 
can laser people to death with his
fingernails, and a Flashdance 
rip-off show where Elvira gets tar 
dumped on her, and a buming-atthe-stake scene, and 367 breast 
jokes  but nothing compares to 
the Vegas production number 
finale, where Elvira dresses up 
like Ann-Margaret.

Recovering from mid-semester and a busy 
week in the Music Department made attending 
any outside concerts impossible this week, in
cluding having to miss the Hilliard Ensembles 
Renaissance and Baroque Society concert Sat
urday evening. This coming week, however, 
promises a few exciting programs in the area.
The Pittsburgh Opera presents La Boheme 
in three more performances (opening night was 
Saturday) on Tuesday (7:00 pm), Friday (8 pm) 
and Sunday (2 pm) 
at the Benedum Cen
ter. Ke.es Bakels con
ducts and Horacio 
Aragon directs a 
young international 
cast that includes 
Mexican soprano Ro
sario Andrade as Mimi and American tenor 
Richard Leech as Rodolfo. The production is in 
the original Italian with English supertitles 
projected by OpTrans above the stage. The 
story is of two young Parisians who (guess 
what...) fall in love and plan to live happily ever 
after. Well, Fate isnt so kind to them and the 
final scene is one of the all-time favorite tearjerkers in all of opera. Call ahead or arrive 
early if you want to see this show. The Benedum 
Center Box office number is 281-0912.
Sunday afternoon is the final concert in a 
series of seven featuring pianist Eunice Norton 
playing the entire Beethoven piano sonata cycle 
(32 in all). The eighty year old pianist cele
brates the 100th anniversary of the Pittsburgh 
Tuesday Music Club with this series. Admis
sion is free and the concert takes place at the 
Frick Fine Arts Auditorium in Oakland, Sun
day October 30 at 4 pm.
That same evening, Donald Wilkins conducts
EIot VsEb
the first of this years Pittsburgh Oratorio Soci
ety concerts, this one a program entitled Glo
ries of English Church Music. In addition to 
his positions as director of music at Calvary 
Episcopal Church and as director of the Orato
rio Society, Wilkins teaches organ and theory 
classes at Carnegie Mellon. Works of Tallis, 
Byrd, Purcell, Britten and Walton make up the 
program which takes place in Calvary Episco
pal on Shady Avenue in Shadyside. The church 
is an ideal setting for 
the pieces, all written 
for similar cathedral 
spaces in England, and 
the evening promises to 
be an exciting one. Call 
661-7023 for ticket in
formation.
The Pittsburgh Symphony is not in perform
ance at Heinz Hall this weekend, but performs 
concerts Thursday and Friday at Indiana Uni
versity of Pennsylvania and Mt. Lebanon High 
School in their Community Concerts series. 
Former Carnegie Mellon Music Department 
head Sidney Harth will conduct the orchestra 
in those concerts.
More importantly, though, excitement is 
building for Lorin Maazels first concert with 
the orchestra in the role of Music Director on 
November 10. His inaugural concert will be 
broadcast live on WQED-FM beginning with a 
half hour of special features and interviews 
hosted by Jim Cunningham. The concert will be 
a sort of second opening of the symphony sea
son, as the parade of guest conductors for the 
first part of the season finally ends. Pittsburgh 
Symphony concert information is available at 
281-5000 and the Heinz Hall box office number 
is 392-4900.

The Accused oEFrtEt pV tpIbf RrpE
;y STEPHANIE REEDY
raftan Staffwriter
Paramount Pictures The Ac'iised, an intriguing drama about 
real-life rape incident, was re
used last weekend in Pittsburgh, 
though the film deals with a 
ape trial, it has much more to 
|fer than the typical film of its 
irfd. The Accused is different 
ecause not only are the attackrs prosecuted, but the men who 
ritnessed and encouraged the 
ape are also held legally responible. It questions the position of 
nose who witness a violent crime 
tnd do nothing to stop or report it. 
'he Accused attempts to give the 
udience a true understanding of 
he seriousness of rape, and it 
ucceeds.
The story evolves around Sarah 
obias (Jodie Foster), a working(ass woman who is raped in the 
ime room of a bar by three men: 
of them working-class, and 
ie a college student. A number
of men actually encourage and 
witness the rape, yet only one 
calls the police. Sarahs case is 
given to an up-and-coming dis
trict attorney named Katheryn 
Murphy (Kelly McGillis), whose 
main interest is in becoming more 
successful in the DAs office she 
works out of.
Murphy refuses to let Sarah get 
up on the witness stand because 
Sarah had been drinking and 
smoking pot the night of the rape, 
and would not be convincing to a 
jury. She lets her personal goals 
of not wanting to lose a case get in 
the way of Sarahs need to tell her 
story, and settles for a guilty plea 
from the attackers for reckless 
endangerment, a crime less seri
ous than rape. Katheryn Murphy 
eventually decides to help Sarah 
after she realizes how much a 
trial means'to her, and begins a 
prosecution against the witnesses 
who encouraged the men to join 
in the rape.
The film is terribly realistic,
starting with the medical exami
nation Sarah must go through 
after being raped, her feelings of 
confusion and shame as a result 
of the incident, and the rape scene 
itself.
Not only does director Jonathan 
Kaplan (Over the Edge, Project X) 
show everything leading up to 
the rape, he gives us a vivid por
trayal of a woman being held 
against her will on top of a pinball 
machine, while being sexually 
assaulted by three different men. 
Despite the audiences wishes, the 
director refuses to hide or soften 
any part of the scene; he shows us 
the details of the men who are 
cheering the event, as well as the 
rapists and the revolting ecstasy 
they receive from their explicitly 
violent act.
This particular part of the film 
not only stirs intense feelings of 
anger, but makes one feel truly 
disgusted with these men. This 
rape is not only a violent act by 
one person, but a gang-bang, a
good time, a party. These men 
receive a true sexual thrill from 
assaulting this woman, and feel 
no sense of shame or regret about 
it at all; instead they claim that 
she asked for it. After witness
ing such animalistic behavior and 
attitudes, it is impossible to walk 
out of the theatre and feel the 
same way as when walking in.
The scene was specifically in
tended to be this explicit to prove 
a point: rape is wrong, no matter 
how the woman is dressed, no 
matter how flirtatious she is. 
Nothing gives a man (or men) the 
right to sexually abuse someone. 
It also condemns the men who 
watched it happen and cheered, 
as they are brought to trial and 
convicted of eliciting the rape.
Overall the film was an excel
lent portrayal of the facts, as well 
as the emotions that go along with 
them. Jodie Fosters portrayal of 
Sarah is a moving one. It is easy 
to relate to her and what she is 
going through because she gives
the audience such a personal 
outlook on Sarahs experience. 
Kelly McGillis plays a very con
vincing district attorney who lets 
her heart overcome her career 
goals and helps Sarah get over 
what has happened by punishing 
those who encouraged and par
took in it. The development of 
Katheryn and Sarahs relation
ship from lawyer and client to a 
friendship based on trust is par
ticularly interesting to watch.
Despite the films brutal and 
controversial treatment of the 
subject of rape, or perhaps be
cause of it, The Accused is defi
nitely worth seeing. Not only does 
it stir emotions and thoughts that 
we often keep hidden inside our
selves, but it raises important 
questions about the responsibili
ties that both criminals and the 
witnesses of crimes must accept.
The Accused is playing in thea
ters around Pittsburgh. Check the 
daily papers or call the Info Desk 
for listings.

Playhouse
By DAVID LEVY
Tartan Contributing Editor
What do you do when the 
country you live in is mostly 
black and you are part of the 
white minority that rules the 
country? Do you turn around 
and try to ignore the injus
tices of your own countrymen? 
Or do you join the demonstra
tors and help them?
When Students Against 
Apartheid and other groups 
tried to raise our awareness 
of the injustices in South 
Africa they talked about the 
white inhumanity to black. 
They did not often talk about 
the whites who did try to help.
Sure, you might hear Biko 
on the radio and think about 
Peter Gabriel, but what of 
South Afrikaners? How many 
people had heard of Donald 
Woods before this week? How 
many will know who he is 
after tomorrow night?
The movie A World Apart 
shows other white people who 
tried to help. It is a slightly 
fictionalized biography by 
Shawn Slovo of the Roth 
family. Both Gus and Diana 
Roth are journalists who give 
their support to the antiapartheid cause. They have 
three daughters: Molly, 
Miriam and Jude. Molly is 
the oldest and serves as the 
narrator, or point of view, for 
most of the movie.
She is thirteen, goes to a 
nice school, has a best friend 
and all that a thirteen year 
old could want. She even takes 
Spanish dancing lessons af
ter school. The only bad thing 
that has happened to her is 
that her father has left in the 
early hours of the morning.
When she visits her mother 
at work she sees that the 
world is not all roses and tea 
cakes. She reads of an anti
apartheid rally and steals a 
flyer. She reads the stories on

his Muppet) to campus.
Fishers appearance 
was coordinated by 
H&SS Senior Amanda 
Cohen, who also served 
as the evenings master

A variety of interesting and 
Jinique exhibitions will continue 
fin the local area for the remain
der of the fall season. The art 
exhibitions include the works of 
ifcMU alumnus Francis Crisafio, 
the 44th annual Craftsmens 
Jujld Exhibition, three new in
stallations at the Mattress Fac.ory, a joint exhibition of fabric 
sculpture and another joint 
Exhibition of contrasting photo*raphic styles.
| Love, Sex and God, an exhibi! tion of paintings, prints, draw
ings and video by CMU alumnus 
i Francis Crisafio, will continue to 
i run through November 5th at the
j^nd 
Carson Street Gallery, 1102 E. 
Carson Street. The dreamlike 
imagery of his artwork reflects 
the honesty and spirituality in 
his work, which creates his unique 
style. The titles of some of the 
pieces also illustrate his bizarre 
quality: Freuds Fathers Finger 
Finally Figured It Out, Junior 
Examines the Facts of Life, Mar
riage of the Invisible Man and 
Looks Like a Dyke and Smells 
Like a Dock. The musical side of 
the artist is creatively expressed 
in the video, which is based on a 
lithograph, Between the Beat, 
done in collaboration with 
filmmaker Rod Agras. The intro
spection of Crisafios creative 
expression sets him apart from 
the crowd, making Love, Sex,
and God an attractive exhibi
tion.
The Mattress Factory is a defi
nite must see for those interested 
in uncommon museum collections. 
The museum has opened its Fall 
exhibition season with three new 
installations at the 1414 Mon
terey gallery running until De
cember 23. The new featured 
artists include Houston-based 
artist Glen Gentile, San Diego 
artist Mathieu Gregoire and 
Canadian John Massey. Also 
showing are the permanent in
stallations of Jene Highstien, Bill 
Woodrow, Allen Wexler and two 
light installations of James Turrell by appointment only. These

Yknow, I could get used to 
this two good shows a week 
thing. Wonder if this could be a 
trend.
Fishbone was red hot, if 
sparsely attended - lots of CMU 
students were oblivious to the 
fact that the show was even 
going on, much less cheap. 
Those who did come down to 
the Mosque Ballroom were 
treated to a jumpin show, even 
more so due to the five foot
barricade in front of the _____
stage. Ostensibly to keep 
the crowd off the stage, 
the wall blew it for any
one under five feet - noth
ing like seeing a band 
from the shoulders up.
(New advances in pro
duction technology have 
solved this problem with 
a technique known as 
raising the stage.) The band 
didnt want it, the crowd didnt 
want it, people were going over 
it anyway - so why was it there?
On a bit more sedate note, the 
Billy Bragg/ Michelle Shocked 
show went over really well as 
well. Sitting through an entire 
show was a new experience 
(hell, having rows of chairs 
around was a new experience) 
and the Carnegie Music Hall is 
one posh place. As Mister Bragg 
said, Wow, culture! (It 
sounded great, too. They waste 
this place on orchestras?) The 
only time the surroundings were 
a bother was during Weddings, 
Parties, Anythings set - the 
seats may be nice, but theres 
no room to dance between them.
(Two tours with the newly elected 
Saviours of Rock and Roll, two 
albums out in Australia, and no 
releases in the States - I will 
never understand the recording 
industry.) Michelle Shocked did a 
comfortably informal set (acous
tic, thank god) that made her new 
album seem even more overpro
duced than before. Billy Braggs 
set was less chatty - he tends to 
opine, where Shocked just talks - 
and he played a lot of his new 
stuff, which I dont care for, but a 
reworking of Elvis Costellos 
Olivers Army aimed at Our Man
Music Music Music 
In 
Review
Ollie was something to have the 
old tape recorder running for.
(Editors Note: Dan had the good 
sense to steer clear of the Graffiti 
on Friday night for the Affordable 
Floors/They Might Be Giants 
double bill, but yours truly was 
not so prudent. Not the music, 
which was greatthe Floors add 
a lot of bottom line in their live 
shows which you dont get on the 
album, and They Might Be Giants 
have got the bizzaro dance/polka 
market pretty well locked up with 
their new release Lincoln  but 
the crowd at the all-ages show 
was filled with slamdancing 
twelve-year-olds. Yuck. Impor
tant safety tip  if youre going to 
an all-ages show at a Pittsburgh 
club, go on a school night and you
might evade the Invasion of the 
Trendy Tots.)
Album Of The Week: Human 
Music, a double album compi
lation released by Homestead 
Records. Homestead is one of 
the few record labels that 
doesnt have its corporate head 
firmly planted in its corporate 
ass, and has been responsible 
for unleashing huge amounts 
of good music upon the world. 
Some of the stuff on the album 
has been released before, but 
none of it is easy to find if it has 
been, so check it out here in
stead. (Besides, if you 
hate it, its close enough 
to Christmas, and 
theyll never know it 
came in shrink-wrap...)
Shows to look for: 
tonight, Rotondi will be 
at the Graffiti. A new 
wave polka band, 
theyre better than their 
press release implies. A 
good band to drink beer to, and 
those that can drink beer are 
the only ones who will be get
ting in. Thursday, Skinny 
Puppy will be playing for the 
big hair crowd of all ages. Their 
new album may be lacking in 
whomp, but their stage show is 
rumored to be pretty dam 
graphic. (The new album is 
called VIVI Sect VI, so take a 
wild guess at which direction 
the graphic part will be.) The 
show itself is going to be pretty 
darn expensive (as in fourteen 
bucks), so get your tickets ahead 
of time and save a buck or so.
Far and upcoming: Bullet LaVolta, Slayer, and Motorhead. 
Stay tuned.

The Birmingham Loft presents 
Fabrications, an exhibition of 
fabric wallhangings by Gemma 
Davies and metal sculptures by 
Anthony R. Vitale. The works of
Davies are actually quilts of 
untraditional formats. Her crea

painting and stuffing the fabric, 
creating raised, fluid lines. Vitale 
works include large, outdoor, 
wind-driven pieces and smaller, 
movable, indoor works in steel. 
He also works in copper, brass, 
stainless steel and ornamental 
iron pieces that are seen as truly 
Pittsburgh. The special feature 
of the exhibition is a collaborative 
piece between the two artists. 
Located at 24 South 18th St., the

Bent presents a quite person;!

If youre up for some serious movie viewing, check 
out this flick. Richard Attenboroughs masterpiece is 
set in contemporary South Africa, documenting the 
ongoing struggle of the African black population 
against apartheid. Denzel Washington portrays 
Stephen Biko, a black activist fighting for the rights 
of his people. During his struggle, Biko dies in prison 
under mysterious circumstances. Kevin Kline plays 
the white newspaper editor Donald Woods who brings 
! Stephen Bikos story out into the spotlight. The rest of 
ithe movie centers around Woods efforts to reveal the 
governments injustices and trying to get out of the 
country with his life and family. A powerful movie 
'that is highly recommended. Also note that the reallife Donald Woods will be lecturing on campus soon.

Hellnaisen
What better way to celebrate Halloween than with 
horror movie, and boy, does this qualify! The story 
centers around a mysterious puzzle box that unlocks 
the secret of the ultimate pleasures, and then un
leashes the forces of hell upon its victims. This movie 
is filled with violence, cannibalism, blood, and an 
mimaginable amount of gore (do not eat before viewng). Believe it or not, all of this stomach-retching 
Irama is centered around a love story. A truly bizarre 
novie that will satisfy the most jaded horror addicts, 
t has my vote for the Bring-A-Date pick of the week.

Beetlejuice
Yet another way to celebrate Halloween; instead 
bf a horror movie, a comedy staring Michael Keaton in 
the title role. The premise: a rural couple (Geena 
Davis and Alec Baldwin) are restoring their dream 
home in New England when their plans are altered by 
[their abrupt entrance into the afterlife. Things are 
just fine in the after world, despite their confinement 
in their house, until a New York family moves in and 
creates total chaos. The couple calls on a bio-exorcist 
(Betelgeuse, pronounced Beetlejuice) to rid them
selves of the troublesome New Yorkers. From there 
on, things get even wackier. A great comedy worthy of 
being a nights entertainment.

The Binds
Combine Alfred Hitchcock, a Pacific coastal town, 
and a few million really angry birds and you have a 
terrifying classic movie. It is one of Hitchcocks best 
:echnical achievements, for it employs nearly 400 
trick shots, and bird training that today is still a 
monumental task. A truly haunting film that will 
leep you on the edge of your seat and take you off 
loultry for a month. This is the final film in the AB

Alabaster and charcoal mix 
down at Forbes Gallery
By JULIET1'E BORDA
Special to The Tartan
Its something you dont see 
much of at Carnegie Mellon, 
Cecilia Cappiello said, referring 
to the technique she used to sculpt 
a piece of alabaster: she used a 
hammer and chisel to hand-carve 
her sculpture. Alabaster is a 
common white stone that is a little 
softer than marble (a fact that 
affects only the sculptor). Cecilias 
carved piece is about the size of a 
large loaf of bread, and is abstract 
in form. Cecilia decided on ab
straction after observing the rocks 
characteristics. Not initially hav
ing a plan for where to stop work
ing and call it a finished piece, she 
carved until she was happy with 
the form.
Childhood Influences
Her work attempts to define 
energy in a static piece through 
the continuous, wrapping forms 
that make up the sculpture itself. 
Cecilias influences include Henry 
Moore, as well as an artist she 
has known since she was a child 
H. Gil Roberts. She remembers 
visiting galleries in her hometown 
of Lyme, Connecticut, that showed 
his work. His sculptures intrigued 
and influenced her enough to do it 
herself  a feeling that many can 
relate to, having childhood inspi
rations.
Todd Bross does not cite indi
viduals as having influenced his 
abstract drawings. His art is made 
through a very sincere procedure:
he just sits down and draws. He 
does not begin each drawing with 
a visual goal in mind. Often, in 
fact, if he feels that one of his 
drawings is leading somewhere, 
and he tries to follow that route, 
he is led elsewhere in his pursuit.
Spirit of the Holocaust
Although they are mixed media 
pieces, his drawings are mostly in 
charcoal and have a spiritual 
quality, felt through their dark
valued atmospheres. Todd is cur
rently working on a series of 
drawings, 38"x 50" and larger, 
that refer to the Holocaust; the 
deeply felt spiritual emotions of 
that time are abstractly depicted 
in his drawings. If not informed, 
the viewer probably would not re
alize the associations of Todds 
work to the Holocaust (unless 
there were telling titles), but the 
reference is understood if it is 
taken into consideration while 
viewing the work. The drawings 
are strong either way  refer
ence or no reference.
Besides their drawings and 
sculptures, Todd will also show 
computer-generated (with a little 
help from him) art, and Cecilia 
will exhibit black and white pho
tographs. The opening reception 
is tonight from 7-9 pm; everyone 
is welcome to attend. Meet real 
artists and eat free food at The 
Forbes Gallery, comer of Marga
ret Morrison Street and Forbes

thing. These moments cant help 
but stand out, and the actors do a 
fine job with them, but it seems as 
if these brief lapses into honesty 
are only temporary respite from 
the misery of the rest of the play.
So what is the point? If Rabe is 
simply showing us ugliness for its 
own sake there is something to be 
said for not subjecting us to it for 
two hours and making our lives 
uglier in the process. If there is 
hope in the few moments of sin
cere caring that we see on that 
stage, it is not explored in any 
depth and we certainly have paid 
for it. Its like a work of art that is 
aesthetically offensive to make 
its point about something terrible, 
only the play takes up a lot more 
of our time doing it.
If I condemn Hurlyburly en
tirely and say that I hate it, Rabe 
and the people who put it on here 
at CMU will probably just chuckle 
and say Good, it worked. Per
haps we are meant to feel used.

Tartan Staffwriter
The City Theatre Company re
cently began its fifteenth season 
with the regional premiere of the 
!play Frankie and Johnny in the 
Claire de Lune by Terrence MciNally. The show is now running 
until October 30 at the New City 
Theatre, located at Bouquet and 
Sennott Streets in Oakland. The

. The play, which is currently 
enjoying a very successful run OffBroadway with Bruce Weitz and 
f Carol Kane, tells the story of a lastshot romance between Frankie, the 
realist, and Johnny, the romantic. 
Marc Masterson, the Artistic Di
rector of the City Theatre, says, 
Its a very funny pi ay but McNally 
also raises some real issuesques
tions of intimacy, questions of 
;trust.
The play stars Pittsburgh native 
;Susan Chapek as Frankie, a wait
ress who has put her dreams of 
bigger and better things on hold 
trying to just get by. Chapek is a 
veteran Pittsburgh actress, direc
tor and voiceover artist and has 
appeared in more than two dozen 
productions of the Pittsburgh 
Metropolitan Stage Company. 
Among her many roles were Agnes 
in Agnes of God and Honey in Whos 
Afraid of Virginia Woolf?. She also 
staged Peter and the Wolf for the 
Pittsburgh Symphony as well as 
playing the Evil Fairy for the 
symphonys performance of Sleep
ing Beauty.
Also starring is Don Marshall of 
Aliquippa, who plays Johnny, the 
short-order cook who loves 
Shakespeare, meat loaf, Bach and 
chopping vegetables. Although 
currently working as a freelance 
actor in industrial films, Marshall 
has also played Rose in the City 
Theatres Rose Cottages and

African government to pick people up and hold 
them 90 days for questioning. This is a central 
point to the movie because Diana Roth becomes 
the first white woman imprisoned by the 90 Day 
Act.
The movie then shows Mollys exclusion from 
white society because of her father who has dis
appeared and her imprisoned dissident mother. 
She is then immersed in the black culture that 
surrounds her. She learns of what the black Af
rikaners want and befriends them; in her eyes, 
they regain the humanity that the white society 
has taken from them.
The movie stars Barbara Hershey as Diana 
Roth and Jodhi May as Molly. Both actresses 
play to their stereotypes  there is very little 
warmth from either.
Barbara Hersheys portrayal of ahardline jour
nalist leaves little room for love for her children. 
There are glimmerings when the police come to 
take her away, but the ice does not really thaw 
until the end. By the time it does it is hard to 
believe that the situation is real.
Jodhi May reminds us that young children can
also have major mood swings. Mollys major role 
is to cry. Admittedly 13 year olds do a lot of 
crying, but the why me attitude is monoto
nous.
The real acting in this movie comes from the 
South African actors Albee Lesotho, Yvonne 
Bryceland and Lynda Mvusi. They bring a sense 
of reality to the movie that is lacking from the 
lead actors.
Should you go to the Playhouse and see this 
movie? YES! I think that it was a good movie 
that gives more insight into the plight of the 
South Africans. It also is a good production 
overall. It is just missing those extra touches 
that make a film great and continually captivat
ing.
It is very hard to show real life on film becausc 
most people do not want to know about the real 
world. Director Chris Menges is adequate in his 
directorial debut, but a more polished director 
could have brought out just a bit more.

Campara proud of work in Student Affairs
JBy ALBRECHT T. POWELL
; Tartan Contributing Editor
! Ive got a hard time tolerating 
incompetence. Im a perfectionist 
and I demand perfection from 
i people around me. stated Ron 
'Campana, Attorney at Law, Di; rector of Greek Affairs, and As; sistant to the Dean of Legal Af
fairs, from behind his gavel. 
Campana works for the Student 
! Affairs office under Dean Braden 
Walter. Hes a bit of a jack of all 
trades.
I get involved with all aspects 
of student affairs, not just my job 
title. I work with freshman orien
tation, discipline matters, and 
about anything else I can get my 
hands on. I really like working 
'with students  they make this 
-job wonderful, Campana said.
- Campana defines his job as 
Director of Greek Affairs simply 
as God to the Greek system. He 
js responsible for the administra
tive and financial details of keep
ing the system running smoothly .
Many of the deci
sions I make do 
not win me 
friends. 
Ron Campana
: Then theres the other part of 
the job: Ill get calls at almost 
anytime during the night to help 
mediate disputes, break up fights, 
appease neighbors when they call 
about too much noise, deal with 
Pittsburgh Police, and so on. It 
doesnt matter, it might just be 
when Physical Plant or Security 
sees 3 beer cups on the street. He 
warned, Dont get me wrong. 
Theyre a great bunch of people,
photo by Albrecht T. Powell 
Student Affairs Ron Campana takes pride in his 
lines of communication.
but being in charge of such a large 
number of students makes for a 
busy job.
Campana is proud of the excel
lent lines of communication be
tween himself, the Greek sys
tem, the rest of the university, 
outside people such as neighbors, 
and the Pittsburgh Police. Cam
pana said, There have been prob
lems with the system in the past.
Ive taken a very hard-nosed at
titude about it. Im 
here to manage a 
system. Many of the 
decisions I make do 
not win me friends, 
but Ive got to do 
whats beneficial to 
the university and 
the students.
Campana is also 
the Assistant to the 
Dean for Legal Serv
ices. This position, 
newly created by William Elliott,
Vice President for Enrollment, is 
designed to augment the current
legal procedures on 
campus. Campana 
will be advising the 
Office of Student 
Affairs on any le
gal matters. There 
are so many poli
cies and procedures 
involved with a uni
versity such as civil 
rights issues, con
tracts, and waiv
ers, that you need 
someone to be a 
contact person and 
to advise on the 
law. Thats me. 
Campana will also 
try to be available 
to student groups 
and to individual 
students on a lim
ited basis. This is 
not a legal clinic, 
but I can help point 
a student in the right direction 
for matters such as landlord and 
tenant problems.
In addition to his involvement 
with Carnegie Mellon, Campana 
also has a small private practice 
and sits as an arbiter in small 
claims court. Simply put, Im a 
workaholic. I usually get in the of
fice around eight in the morning, 
and often do not leave until eight 
at night. Then theres the pracHow do you relax? Campana 
smiled. Well, I work. Besides 
that, I love to play tennis, golf, 
and racquetball, watch football, 
especially Penn State University, 
but most of all, I love to spend 
time with my wife and children.
Campana earned his bachelors 
degree from Penn State Univer
sity in Administration of Justice. 
He worked as a law enforcement 
officer while going to Duquesne 
Law School at night to become a 
lawyer. He came to Carnegie 
Mellon in 1986 as Director of 
Greek Affairs. He is a member of 
the Allegheny County, Pennsyl
vania, and American Bar Asso
ciations, and the Association of 
Fraternity Advisors, as well as 
being chairman of the board of 
the national chapter of his frater
nity.
Most people say Ive got a re
ally hard-nosed attitude, about 
everything, he said. After work
ing with him, you start to realize 
it does not transcend beyond his 
job. Ive got a flashy ego, and Ive 
let it get the best of me many 
times, and Im also pretty tough, 
but, and Ill never admit it, I can 
be pretty nice guy.
Osteoporosis is the age re
lated disease in the bodys 
bone mass (thinning of the 
bone). It affects between 15 
and 20 million Americans 
and is the major cause of 
bone fractures in the elderly 
population. Fractures are a 
significant cause of disabil
ity and death in the elderly. 
Since there is little we can do 
to reverse osteoporosis once 
it has occurred, efforts at pre
vention are most important.
Adults attain their peak 
bone mass between ages 30 
and 35 years. Males gener
ally have a 30% greater bone 
mass than females, and 
blacks 10% greater than 
whites. There is normally 
constant remodeling of bone 
in the body: i.e. bone is con
stantly reabsorbed and re
formed. After reaching its 
peak, bone mass declines 
steadily throughout adult life
at a rate of 1-2% per year. This 
is due to an imbalance between 
bone formation and reabsorp
tion.
The major causes of osteo
porosis are estrogen deficiency 
(i.e. menopause or other 
causes) and aging. In women, 
bone mass decreases rapidly 
in the first 3-7 years following 
menopause. Other risk factors 
for the development of osteo
porosis are:
sedentary lifestyle 
cigarette smoking 
prolonged bed rest, as in 
chronic illness 
 lack of childbearing in women 
caucasian race 
diabetee mellitus 
chronic use of steroid drugs 
females at greater risk than 
males

fractures due to osteoporosis

In 1977, Donald Woods was 
janned by the South African 
government and placed under 
house arrest for his writings as 
feditor of South Africas leading 
anti-apartheid newspaper, the 
London Daily Dispatch.

In the Skibo Ballroom.
Woods is a fifth-generation 
'hite South African who studied 
'aw at the University of Cape
town before beginning a career in 
oumalism. He became editor-inihief of the Daily Dispatch at the 
\ge of 31 in 1965.
His editorial attacks on the 
acial policy of apartheid drew 
ire from the South African govrnment and from many white 
eaders of the newspaper, and

duty to report on my experiwith it.
It all started during a breakfast 
fait to the Kiltie Cafe (Or Club 
Kiltie," as I refer to it whenever I 
around the more sophisticated 
ypes). A snap decision to get a 
toug full of hot chocolate proved 
to be my introduction to this new
and amazing piece of technology. 
I am, of course, referring to the 
Rockwell International Super
sonic Hot Chocolate Delivery 
System. This astounding piece of 
food service technology was developedby Rockwell International 
in conjunction with IBM and SEI 
for Carnegie Mellon University. I 
was amazed by the sheer com
plexity of the machine, and al
though I decided to stick with the 
cola dispenser, my desire to find 
out about the Rockwell Interna
tional Supersonic Hot Chocolate 
Delivery System remained un
tainted.
A visit to the HCSW (Hot Choco
late Skills Workshop) soon cleared 
all of my doubts. A friendly TA 
escorted me to a dimly lit room 
where I was exposed to thirtythree consecutive hours of slide 
presentations which explained 
the varied functions of the Rock
well International Hot Chocolate 
Delivery System, in a pleasant 
and conversational manner.
I rushed back to Club Kiltie to 
try this revolutionary new tech
nology and was stunned to dis
cover that I still did not know how 
to operate the system. I returned 
to the HCSW cluster, where I was 
furnished with a five hundred 
page instruction manual that ex
plained the varied functions of 
the Rockwell International Su
personic Hot Chocolate Delivery 
System, in a pleasant and conver
sational manner. The manual also 
included a complimentary mug; 
however, most students prefer to 
buy several of their own mugs as 
the year progresses.
After three days of avid read
ing, I reached the operating in
structions. I could feel a dull throb 
of excitement raging through my 
loins as I read:

Human sexuality discussed
By BRYAN T. SCHMIDT
Tartan Staffwriter
We chose to do a Human Sexuality series be
cause each month of the semester has a kind of 
theme to it, explains Carnegie Mellons Director 
ofHealth Education Donna Morosky. One month 
might be drugs and alcohol. Another month might 
be exercise. We chose November as being Human 
Sexuality month.
Anne Witchner, years ago, ran a series of pro
grams called Sex at Eight," Morosky continues. 
Instead of having a single five-hour sexuality 
presentation, Student Affairs chose to split the 
program up into several short events which will 
be held each Monday.
The series begins with a speech by History De
partment Head Peter Steams entitled Sex in 
Perspective - Where is the Revolution Now? at 4 
pm on October 31st in the Skibo Ballroom.
There are six events altogether scheduled for 
the series, the last of which occurs on November 
28 at 8 pm in the Skibo Ballroom, where Phil 
Jamison, a counselor with the sexual minority 
support group PERSAD, and Catherine Ander
son, a Clinical Therapist also of PERSAD, will 
lecture on Alternative Lifestyles.
The topics were chosen with a group of staff, 
faculty, and student members getting together 
one day and expressing their concerns about 
sexuality, Morosky says. In addition to the sub
jects already mentioned, lectures will be given on 
intimacy, contraception, and sexually transmit
ted diseases.
Lecturers were chosen carefully, Morosky says. 
Dr. Lome Rabin has a lot of contacts in the 
psychology field. She went beyond the university 
and said These are good sex therapists in the 
area, and this is a good intimacy person. So we 
didnt just choose people from campus. Theres a 
nice combination of community resources as well 
as our own.
The one event in the series not being held on a 
Monday is the Sex Bowl, a contest which was 
started last year by Area Coordinator Cindy Sam
mons. Sex Bowl teams are asked questions deal
ing with sex; an all-male team from Hamerschlag

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  25 October 1988L5
Getting a job isnt as much fun as a problem set
The first thing youre going to 
have to do when you get out of 
here is get a job. After all, thats 
why you came here to begin with. 
You may have thought you came 
to college to enrich yourself, en
lighten your mind, and expand 
your knowledge of the world. But 
lets be real. After all, this is real 
life were dealing with. You want 
moolah. Cash. Dough. Clams.
Money money ____________________
money.
The whole 
purpose of deal
ing with four 
years of the 
educational 
netherworld is 
so you can get 
out of school 
and get a job that pays you scads 
of money so you have nothing to 
worry about. Of course, youll 
always have plenty to worry about 
no matter how much money you 
make, but well get to that some 
other time. Lets stick with this 
job problem for now.
Those of you who chose practi
cal scientific majors that will lead 
automatically into high-paying
jobs with lots of room for promo
tion, hey, good for you, dont waste 
your time with this column. Just 
curl up and die with your $45,000 
paychecks, okay?
Now, for the rest of you, dont 
panic. Well find something for 
you to do. After all this fancy 
schooling, you must have learned 
something useful. If you havent, 
youve done something wrong, and 
a million col
umns arent 
going to help 
you. Lets as
sume for the 
moment that 
after an ex
tended period 
of time in this 
institution of 
higher education, you have in fact 
learned something.
If you havent the slightest 
inkling as to how youll apply your 
newfound wisdom and decide 
what youre going to do to earn 
your keep, now may be a good 
time to start thinking about it. 
Particularly if you are planning 
on graduating in, say, less than a 
year. Get on it already! If you
have more time than that, it 
wouldnt hurt to at least pick out 
a career direction.
From there you have to exam
ine the entirety of your chosen 
career field and eliminate:
a) anything that youre not 
qualified to do
b) anything that would bore you 
to tears
c) anything that involves relo
cating to Madagascar (or to Guam, 
if youre from Madagascar)
d) anything that doesnt pay 
tons of money
Ah, theres that money thing 
again. Money is the primary 
motivational factor in getting a 
job. Its all according to the great 
food chain  your goal is to get a 
good job so you can earn lots of 
money and therefore be a greater 
person who can afford to eat his or 
her underlings.
Still, there are those other fac
tors to worry about, so earning 
your money doesnt become a drag. 
Remember, the key to making 
your real life happy is avoiding 
drags wherever possible. Some 
people find that getting a job with 
nifty benefits makes life happier.
Benefits like health insurance, 
dental insurance, fire insurance, 
toe-stubbing insurance, paper-cut 
insurance, and locust insurance 
give the illusion of personal secu
rity which is so important in real 
life.
When you take action and be
gin your search for employment, 
youll find that the university can 
actually help. Carnegie Mellon 
provides a career placement serv
ice which is located, oddly enough, 
in the Career Placement Office in 
the bowels of Warner Hall. If you 
provide them with two hundred 
million copies of your resume, your 
transcript, your reference letters 
(and no, the Burger King one 
doesnt count), your fingerprints, 
your mug shots, and your family 
album, they then will see to it 
that prestigious companies give 
you at least a passing glance be
fore they hire someone more 
qualified.
You see, CMU would like you to 
believe that they actually care 
about whether you find a job that 
will start you on the path to ful
filling your career dreams and 
leading a happy life. The truth is
that the university is as pleased 
to be rid of you as you are to leave, 
and they just want to be sure that 
you can afford to pay back your 
college loans when you start your 
real life. You guessed it  the 
money argument again. Youll 
find thats a recurring theme in 
real life.
Okay, so youve got your job, 
with or without the help of Career 
Placement. What do you do now? 
Assimilate. Youll be a mere col
lege graduate in a swinging cor
porate world of people with more 
background, deeper experience, 
and better suits than you. Even 
after you spend a wad reconstruct
ing your whole wardrobe, youll 
still be The Kid.
This will be a shock, havingjust 
come out of school where you were 
the top class and the toast of the 
school and thought nothing of spit
ting on defenseless freshmen. 
Prepare to be treated as the infe
rior that you now are. Do your 
best to fit in, work with the team, 
contribute to the whole. Mostly 
this means doing everything they 
tell you to do. No blowing off as
signments, and no extensions. But
remember  youre in it for thp 
money.
Money will get you through ^ 
lot of job-related traumas. Wheiji 
your boss casually remarks that 
if you dont finish your project 
within forty-eight seconds, hi 
boss will hang you by your yello\^ 
power tie, relax and remembef 
that you are getting lots of money}, 
When your officemate threaten^ 
to fax a memo revealing to th 
entire corporation that you ar 
having an affair with the boss 
secretary, consider the money. In 
fact, consider using it to shut uji 
your officemate before you get into 
real trouble.
Assuming you manage to kee 
up with your work, you will sooi 
settle into your job and real lif 
will begin. Youll find a place ti 
live and store all of your starchy 
outfits for work. Youll buy a car 
and maybe even find some alter* 
nate routes to work to give the 
illusion of variety. Basically youlj 
be swept up in the tide of real lif 
that will wash over you with stun| 
ning force and leave you choking 
on the salt and seaweed. Get used 
to it. Theres more to come. )
AIESEC promotes international business
By CATHERINE LO MONICO
Tartan Assistant Features Editor
AIESEC is the largest student-run, non-political, 
non-profit organization in the world, according to 
Deepak Gupta, the president of its CMU chapter. 
AIESEC is a French acronym, which translates to 
The International Association of Students in Eco
nomics and Management. The organization was 
founded to promote international cooperation and 
understanding by seven students from different 
European countries after World War II. Carnegie 
Mellon founded its chapter in 1976 and is now part 
of a network of over 550 chapters in 67 countries.
AIESEC is an international traineeship program 
with three main objectives: promoting internation
alism in the academic and business community, 
providing practical business experience, and edu
cating its members in international and cultural 
issues.
We help them grow professionally, so they are 
used to a business environment, says Gupta.
To promote internationalism in the academic and 
business community, the local AIESEC chapter 
finds jobs for foreign AIESEC members. For every 
;job it finds in the Pittsburgh area, CMU AIESEC 
can send a student to work in a country abroad.
AIESEC provides practical business experience 
through ten different programs within the organi
zation. These programs include marketing the 
AIESEC program, public relations, management 
information systems, alumni relations, and finance 
(bookkeeping, accounting and budgeting). Every 
year CMU AIESEC organizes discussions for the 
corporate community, and this year it will feature 
The New Era of International Business. One of 
ithe most important programs AIESEC offers is the 
reception and company service division, which takes 
'responsibility for foreign AIESEC students in the
We help them grow profes
sionally, so they are used to a 
business environment.  
Deepak Gupta
Pittsburgh area. This task involves cultural orien
tation and employer relations as well as other 
important services.
AIESEC educates its members in international 
and cultural issues through seminars and confer
ences held regionally, nationally and internation
ally. Every year, the last two weeks in February is 
the international conference, open to all members. 
This year it will be held in Quebec.
The CMU chapter of AIESEC presently has 25 
members and three exchange students, not includ
ing the six that just finished their stay. This year 
exchange students have come here from Poland, 
Spain, the Philippines, Ghana, Brazil, Israel, and 
Italy. These international students found intern
ships at US Steel, Westinghouse, Blue Cross, 
Equibank, PPG, and a number of other large corpo
rations.
Unfortunately, AIESEC has more companies 
apply to the program than students, and it is 
difficult to match students with jobs in foreign 
countries and match jobs for foreign students here 
in Pittsburgh. AIESEC encourages all students to 
participate in the exchange, even if they are not 
industrial management majors.
Everyone thinks of us as just a business organi
zation. However, we give experience in the busi
ness world which most students end up needing at 
some time in their career anyway, regardless of 
their major, says Gupta.

eVRE suggestions for fast food in the upcoming party season
. Theres a festive feeling in the 
air, even though were just past 
midterms and uncontrollably 
rushing toward finals. Hallmark 
stores are stocking up with even 
tackier notions than usual, mostly 
grange and black. Giant Eagle 
has immense, aggressive candy 
displays, that reach out, grab your 
throat and yell, Buy! Eat! People 
are throwing parties. If youre 
throwing a party, and you want to 
have imaginative munchies for 
guestsand trick-or-treaters, that 
are just a little healthier than 
some of the standard store-bought 
ones, here are some ideas.
! Lets start with a couple that 
tan be made in hot-pots.
Caramel Apples 
1 You need: 4 or 5 medium size 
apples (choose tart apples like 
Granny Smith or Red Rome)
Wooden sticks (Kraft includes 
them with the caramels)
1 14-oz bag Kraft caramels
2 tbsp. water 
wax paper
butter or margarine to grease 
the wax paper 
Wash and dry apples; insert 
stick into the stem end of each 
apple. Melt caramels with water 
in 1-1/2 quart heavy saucepan (or 
hot pot) over low heat, stir fre
quently until smooth (if the cara
mel sauce is too thin, let stand 
about 2 minutes before dipping 
apples). Dip apples into hot cara
mel sauce, turn them until en
tirely coated. Scrape excess cara
mel from the bottom of apples. 
Place on greased paper and store 
in refrigerator. Let them stand at 
room temperature 15 minutes 
before serving, to allow caramel
to soften.
Fudge
1 12-oz package semi-sweet 
chocolate chips 
1 can sweetened condensed milk 
1 tbsp vanilla 
shallow baking pan 
Melt chocolate chips over very 
low heat in saucepan (or hot pot). 
Add sweetened condensed milk 
and vanilla, mix well. Pour into 
the pan, let harden in refrigera
tor.
Variations:
Peanut Butter Fudge
Add 1/2 cup peanut butter to 
other ingredients before pouring 
into pan.
Rocky Road Fudge
Fold in marshmallows, nuts, 
extra chocolate chips and raisins 
just before you pour the fudge 
into the pan (If you take too long, 
the marshmallows or chocolate 
chips will melt).
Here are some easy cookie reci
pes.
Chocolate Drop Cookies
1 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup butter 
1 egg
6 tbsp cocoa
1/2 cup milk
1 1/2 tsp vanilla
2 cups flour
1/2 tsp baking soda
2/3 cup chopped nuts 
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. 
Mix everything together in big 
bowl, except nuts. Blend well, then 
fold in nuts. Drop rounded teaspoonfuls on ungreased cookie 
sheet. Bake for 10 minutes or 
until done. (Source: Feingold 
Cookbook)
Potato Chip Cookies, or 
What To Do With The 
Broken Ones At The Bottom 
Of The Bag
2 sticks butter or margarine 
3/4 cup sugar 
1 1/2 cups flour 
1/2 cup chopped nuts 
1/2 cup crumbled potato chips 
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. 
Cream together margarine and
sugar. Add flour'. Stir in potato 
chips and nuts. Drop by rounded 
teaspoonfuls onto ungreased; 
cookie sheet. Bake for 10 mini 
utes. (Source: Brandeis Cook 
book)
Pecan Cookies
1 cup soft butter/margarine
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 cup confectionery sugar
1 tbsp vanilla
2 cup flour
1 cup chopped pecans.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees 
Blend butter, salt, sugar, vanilla-. 
Add flour and pecans and mb$ 
well. Chill for 1 hour. Shape intd 
small balls and place on ungreased 
baking sheet. Bake for 15 mini 
utes.
CMU adds HCSW course
continued from page L3
Chocolate Delivery System Ac
count would do more for me that 
just provide me with hours of 
amusement. I soon discovered 
that it would also become an inte
gral part of my class work. I will 
admit that I was a little bit con
fused when I discovered that In
tro to Hot Breakfast Beverage 
Delivery System Methodology (13- 
666) had been introduced into the 
core requirements for all students 
of creative writing. However, the 
opportunity to use the Rockwell 
International Supersonic Hot 
Chocolate Delivery System was 
more than an incentive toward 
approaching the class with an 
open mind.
The first lecture proved to be a 
bit of an unnerving experience. 
The professor began by explain
ing that the class would require 
at least three daily sessions with 
the Rockwell International Su
personic Hot Chocolate Delivery 
System. He went on to explain 
that students in the class should 
not leave their work for the last 
minute, as we would not be able 
to gain access to either a Rockwell 
International Supersonic Hot 
Chocolate Delivery System Work 
Station or a mug. I raised my 
hand and asked,
Excuse me, but how many 
Rockwell International Super
sonic Hot Chocolate Delivery 
System Work Stations are there 
on campus?
Two, replied the professor. 
One at Morewood Gardens and 
one at Kiltie Cafe.
And how many students are 
taking this course? I inquired.
Three thousand five hundred 
and sixty.
But how do you expect all of us
Excuse me, but how 
many Rockwell Interna
tional Supersonic Hot 
Chocolate Delivery 
System Work Stations 
are there on campus?
to use the Rockwell International 
Supersonic Hot Chocolate Deliv
ery System three times a day?
We suggest that you reserve a 
Rockwell International Hot 
Chocolate Delivery System Work 
Station in advance.
Surprisingly enough, things 
have gone much better than I 
expected, I actually dont mind 
getting up at three am for a work 
session with the Rockwell Inter
national Supersonic Hot Choco
late Delivery System anymore. 
However,I have been warned that 
if I use the Rockwell International 
Supersonic Hot Chocolate Deliv
ery System excessively, I might 
exceed my quota of cocoa for the 
semester. Nevertheless, if my 
grades pick up, my TA has told 
me that I might be able to get a job 
as a tutor for future generations 
of 13-666 students, and together 
we will create the hot chocolate of 
the future (At least thats what 
the textbook says.). One can only 
feel a wonderful sense of pride 
and wonder at being part of such 
a grand experiment.

The dangers of osteoporosis
continued from page L2
are the vertebral bodies (spine), 
hips, and wrists. The problems 
created by fractures in the eld
erly are related to complications 
of prolonged bedrest, chronic 
pain, and loss of independence. 
These problems have significant 
implications medically, and also 
on a socioeconomic scale.
The prevention of osteoporo
sis involves lifestyle, nutrition, 
and minimizing risk factors. 
Most adults have diets deficient 
in calcium and dairy products. 
Unless there is an underlying 
medical problem (kidney stones, 
kidney disease, etc...) all adults 
over age 40 who are at risk of 
developing osteoporosis should 
take in sufficient calcium to 
meet the daily requiremen. This 
requirement is 1200 mg for premeneopausal women, and 1500 
mg for postmenopausal women 
not on estrogen supplements, 
and men with risk factors for 
osteoporosis. Calcium supple
mentation has been shown to 
retard age related bone loss, 
and to decrease the rate of frac
tures. Major sources of calcium 
are milk and dairy products. 
One eight ounce glass of milk
contains 275-300 mg of calcium 
cannot be consumed in the diet, 
supplements should be taken.
The other major intervention 
that has been undertaken to 
prevent osteoporosis is the use 
of estrogen after menopause in 
women. It has been shown that 
there is a rapid loss of bone 
mass in women in the early 
years following menopause. 
When estrogen treatment is 
begun within the first five years 
of menopause, it is very effec
tive in preventing osteoporo
sis. The major drawback of this 
therapy is an increase in uter
ine cancer. This increased risk 
of uterine cancer can be counter
acted by the use of progesterones along with the estrogen. 
Because of this controversial 
aspect of estrogen therapy, it 
should be reserved for patients 
who are at higher risk for de
veloping osteoperosis.
Other means of prevenion 
are, smoking cessation, regu
lar weight bearing exercise 
(such as walking) and avoid
ance of prolonged bedrest.

peams get sick, 
ust like players
I was trying to tune my radio 0 a decent oldies station a 
couple of days ago, when I hit a 
Rational network station that 
was in the middle of a news 
broadcast. I figured to put the 
Jld time rock and roll on hold 
ftnd get caught up on what was 
going on in the world.
After the announcer gave the 
latest news updates, he started 
[n with the sports. I figured the 
lead story would have someRiing to do with football, and I 
Ivas right, unfortunately.
The announcer said that 
iTerry Bradshaw, the former 
Pittsburgh Steeler quarterback, 
jjid not report to work at CBS 
(ast Sunday, where he is em
ployed as a commentator. At 
first, I didnt think anything 
about this. After all, Terry is a 
;ood ole southern boy who 
made a couple of Burt Reynolds 
'iinovies. I figured he was just 
put a-whoopin and a-hollerin 
fcith some of the fellas before 
Jaine time.
The announcer continued that 
Jradshaw did not report to 
ivork due to illness. Well, shoot! 
le just had one too many of 
hem there Lone Star type 
>rews they have out there in 
Texas where hes a-livin right 
low! It aint nothing a few raw 
iggs and some Tabasco sauce 
vont cure.
The announcer continued that 
Jradshaw had been taken to 
he hospital to run tests on 
iumors detected in his heart.
{oth Bradshaws wife and 
other denied these rumors, 
ut they didnt say what was 
rong. And thats what was 
oubling.
This really didnt sink in at 
first. I thought, Hell, if hes 
pally that sick, I could probably 
ialk down almost any street in 
Pittsburgh and find at least a 
lozen guys who would donate 
[heir own hearts to help out 
ferry!
But soon, it did sink in, hard, 
began to think about this 
"lears Steeler organization 
jompared with the one Bradplayed with in the 1970s. 
differences are clear and 
(re like night and day.
Anyone can take one look at
I at team and can tell what 
tade it so good  everything, 
ley had an innovative coach, 
le runners, acrobatic receivmonsters for linebackers, 
ick walls for linemen, and 
ve all, the best darn quarterick in the league.
|No wonder that Steeler fans 
1988 are bitter. They were 
|sed to seeing two of the 
cades greatest running backs 
laying in the same backfield in 
ranco Harris and Rocky Blier. 
iey had the tough but lovle Mean Joe Greene; its all 
fun to reminisce over.
I turned off my radio and sat 
ck on my bed and looked up 
[t the Terrible Towel I got for 
1979 Super Bowl. I thought 
bout Bradshaw and what he 
Jjust be going through. Hell be 
Weight, I thought, Hes a 
Pittsburgh Steeler. 
it was then that I realized 
^at even though this team is
I,Ul'rently in the basement,
Nyre still the Steelers and the 
jns have to stick with them. 
erry is sick now, so are the 
jteelers  and they can both 
P better.
I'm not passing off the fact 
pat one of the true greats may 
bad shape. Ole #12 will 
'ffme through, like always.

The Tartans (5-2, 2-2
Presidents Athletic Conference, 
2-0 University Athletic Associa
tion) came into Homecoming look
ing for a win after their previous 
two games had slipped through 
their fingers. They ended up 
walloping perennial PAC door
mat Thiel College (0-7, 0-5 PAC), 
44-0. The Tomcats have not 
beaten CMU since 1975.
I thought [we] played a good, 
good, strong, Carnegie Mellontype game, exclaimed Tartan 
Head Coach Rich Lackner after 
the victory, CMUs first shutout 
victory in two years.
For the third time this season, 
the football Tartans scored more 
than 40 points in a game that was 
dominated by the Carnegie Mel
lon backfield. Junior halfback 
Scott Bamyak led the way with 
115 yards and two touchdowns, 
giving him a total of eleven touch
downs this season. Our line did a 
great job, explained Bamyak.
His cohort in the backfield, 
senior fullback Chris Hansen, 
added two touchdowns and 81 
yards of his own. In total, Carne
gie Mellon amassed 408 yards on 
the ground and six touchdowns.
The Tartans were so committed 
to their running game that start
ing quarterback Steve Patemo 
did not throw a pass until under 
two minutes remained in the first 
half and the team already led 14- 0. A combination of extremely 
slippery turf, due to rain and cold 
weather, and a respect for the 
Thiel defense kept Carnegie 
Mellon on the ground. They have 
a good defensive team. I think 
theyre not a bad team; they just
Chris Hansen dives for a Tartan first down on his way to gaining 81 yards and two touchdowns in an easy 44-0 Tartan Homecoming victory.'
got behind, commented Lackner.
The defense also had its best 
game of the season, holding Thiel 
to 136 total yards and forcing five 
turnovers. In the second half we 
did a really great job, beamed 
Defensive Coordinator Terry 
Bodnar. In that half, Thiel man
aged only one first down and 26 
yards, never getting the ball past 
their own 43.
The game was over almost as 
soon as it began. Thiels first drive 
stopped when a diving Mark 
Mittlehauser leapt in front of 
Thiels Mike Monroe, intercept
ing the ball at the Tomcat 47. 
Hansen and company soon made 
short work of the Thiel defense.
The Tartans took six runs before 
finding the end zone and a 7-0 
lead.
The Tomcats did their best to 
match CMU. They drove the ball 
down to the Tartan 15, but the 
drive stalled and Tim Radigan 
missed a 25 yard field goal; Thiel 
never got another chance.
Carnegie Mellon turned around 
and marched the ball back down 
the field. The Tartan running 
backs took the ball 80 yards on 11 
plays for another touchdown and 
a 14-0 lead.
The rest of the game was more 
of the same. Only three Carnegie 
Mellon drives did not end in 
scores. Thirteen different players
carried the ball, four for fifty yards 
or more.
No one was more happy with 
the results than Coach Lackner. 
Its a big lift for team, he pro
claimed, the fact that they per
formed the way they did, I admire 
the kids.
Next Week: The Tartans play 
their final home game against 
Grove City College (3-4,1-3). The 
Wolverines have the PACs most 
prolific pass receiver, Tom Karenbauer who leads the conference 
in both receptions and total yard
age. Throwing to him is the 
conferences fourth rated passer, 
Jeff Cass who has five touchdown 
passes and eight interceptions.
The most valuable man on th 
team though, may be Pizza Hut 
and Kodak. All-American Doug 
Hart. Hart was second in the 
nation last season in Division III 
for field goals per game. He also 
holds the PACs record for the 
longest field goal, 55 yards against 
Hiram two seasons ago.
Last year the two teams met at 
Grove City and Carnegie Mellon 
won 33-22. Chris Hansen ran for 
107 and four touchdowns in the 
Tartan victory.
The game is at 2:00 pm at Mt! 
Lebanon High School. Buses leave 
Skibo starting at 12:00 pm, and 
the game will be on WRCT-FM 
(88.3) at 1:50 pm.eVddEo t2rpt Vrp moEtJfEbpt

The CMU soccer team is look
ing to end its season with a bang. 
Entering the final week of play, 
the Tartans are second in the 
Presidents Athletic Conference 
with an overall record of 8-4-2. 
They are in third place in PAC 
competition with a 2-1 record, 
behind Bethany and John Car
roll, respectively.
The Tartans helped their cause 
by upsetting the Washington 
University Bears last Saturday, 
2-1. The Bears were ranked sec
ond in the nation last year. This 
was a sweet victory for the Tar
tans, who were but one of the 
Bears victims last season.
They arent the same team as 
they were last year, said sopho
more Chris Kasabach. They were 
cheap. They played a very physi
cal game, and it wasnt always 
clean.
The Tartans scored first on a 
goal by junior Eddie Park. Park, 
the PACs leading scorer, netted a 
first-half goal after a mis-kick by 
a Bear defender. It was Parks 12th goal of the season and put 
the Tartans on top 1-0.
Following a Bear score to tie the 
game, freshman Delon Mollet took 
a Justin Pizzellafeed and pounded 
the ball into the upper corner of 
the Bears net. This was the de
ciding goal as the Tartans hung 
on to win.

Mens X-country finishes 
expected third in UAAs
By LEN ONEAL
Tartan Staffwriter
The Carnegie Mellon Mens 
Cross Country team returned 
from Washington University of 
St. Louis with a third place 
finish after a fine showing in 
the University Athletic Asso
ciation Championships.
The team finished behind the 
runners from Brandeis Univer
sity, ranked 3rd nationally, and 
the University of Rochester, 
which is currently ranked 4th 
in the nation. Brandeis had 20 
points for the meet, with Roch
ester scoring 41. CMU rounded 
out the top three with 81 points.
The Tartans were led by 
junior co-captain Dave Supp 
who crossed the finish line in 
fifth place with a time of25:23.
Supp was the only runner to 
finish in the top 10 who was 
not from either Brandeis or 
Rochester. His performance 
earned him a spot on the AllUAA team.
Brandeis Mark Harrington 
won the meet, finishing in a 
course record time of24:59. He 
was followed by two other 
Brandeis runners, Andy and 
John Kimball. A1 Smith of 
Rochester took fourth place.
Although Supp was the only 
one in the top ten for CMU,
some of his teammates were 
not far behind. Freshman Mike 
Damon showed signs of recov
ery following an ankle injury 
earlier in the season by taking 
14th place. Senior co-captain 
Pat Noll finished 17th while 
juniors Gary ft*aeker and Tim 
Berger finished 22nd and 23rd 
respectively.
Head Coach Gary Meckley 
was pleased with his teams ef
fort, especially after what he 
had seen from the team earlier 
in the week. They were just 
coming off midterms and were 
not getting enough rest, and I 
could tell by the workouts in 
practice that [they] were tired. 
I didnt think they would be 
totally prepared for this meet.
The coach continued by say
ing that he wasnt trying to 
make excuses and was pleased 
with their performance.
From his point of view, the 
Tartan runners showed a lot of 
character and if they had 
rested, [CMU] could have made 
it a closer race for second with 
Rochester.
Following this weekends 
PAC meet, the team will have 
a two week rest before running 
in the Eastern Regionals in an 
attempt to reach the Nationals 
for the 12th time in thirteen 
years.

The Carnegie Mellon Womens 
Cross Country team came up short 
of their goal of third or fourth 
place in the UAA Championships 
held last weekend in St. Louis. 
Individual improvements were 
made by Sue Sparks and Franc
esca Crannell, yet the team was 
not content with the fifth place 
finish.
With Emory University upset
ting the defending champions 
from the University of Rochester, 
the competition was exciting.
Emory won the meet with 45 
points, beating out Rochester by 
only three points for the UAA 
title. The overall winner of the 
race was defending champion 
Josefa Benzoni of Rochester. She 
completed the almost entirely flat 
course in 18:17.
Finishing first for CMU, Sue 
Johnson looked ready for more as 
she came across the line in 20:23,
in 20th place. Running at her 
shoulder was Kristin Burgard, 
clocked at 20:27. Carolyn Lowe 
showed good stride and strength 
at the finish as she came across 
the line 31st in 21:10.
The final scoring runner for the 
Lady Tartans, Roseanna 
Neupauer, finished 36th in 21:41. 
Behind her were Francesca Cran
nell (44th), Lois Raska (48th), and 
Kathy Bonham (68th).
Coach Dario Donatelli felt that, 
The meet itself was a track meet.
The Washington University 
course is run on the outskirts of 
baseball fields. It is a very flat 
and fast course. My girls are tal
ented runners, but they are ac
customed to running a challeng
ing cross country course such as 
the one in Schenley Park. 
Donatelli said about Presidents 
Athletic Conference meet, I am 
confident that they will be ready 
and waiting for their chance to 
defend their PAC title on their 
home course on Saturday.
Burgard and Johnson knew that 
they had to turn in excellent indi
vidual performances. Johnson, 
said, I ran a good race, but I need 
to run a smart race. In the future, 
I have to tell myself to get out 
quicker. I felt fine at the end of 
the race, but had lost too many 
places at the beginning by hold
ing myself back.
Burgard added, Overall our 
times were good. Yet the times 
just werent fast enough to take a 
top position in the meet.

Ultimate update...
Pittsburgh to host regionals
By TODD WILLIAMS
Pittsburgh Flying Disc Society 
Newsletter
On Saturday, September 3rd, 
the UPA Mid-Atlantic Region 
held its 20 Years of Ultimate 
Captains Meeting on the Mall 
in Washington, D.C. Thirtynine mens and womens teams 
were represented by captains 
from all three sections (PA-DENJ and MD-D.C.-VA-NC) with 
J' two topics to consider: upcom
ing UPA officer elections and
the fall schedule of tournaments.
This time, all news is good news. 
After some intense, last minute 
lobbying and three recounts, the 
captains decided on Pittsburgh to 
host the regional tournament for 
the first time, on November 5th 
and 6th. Hampton Community 
Center will provide the fields, 
along with North Park.
Sectionals will be held in Phila
delphia on October 29th and 30th, 
at the Oaks Fields.
Congratulations to Mark Licata, Crash player and secretary
of PFDS, who was chosen as 
the new Mens Sectional Coor
dinator; and to Bruce Lord of 
Penn State, the new (unoffi
cial) College Regional Coordi
nator. Rumor also has it that 
Nancy McNamee, Pittsburgh 
womens team co-captain, may 
be running for Women's Re
gional Coordinator.
Crash would like to extend 
an invitation to everyone to 
come out and support them in 
their quest for a berth to Na

Comeback year for the Giants
Jy DAVE BRILL
Vartan Staffwriter
This is the last in a series of five 
irticles giving a brief overview of 
!his years NFL teams.
This week: The National Foot)1ll Conference (NFC) Eastern Di) ision.
- New York Giants: After a disippointing season last year, the 
Sants are hungry. With a strong 
racleus intact on offense, the main 
(gestion is how will the the offen
ce line perform.
"With the return of Karl Nelson 
Ed a rejuvenated William 
Joberts, the offensive line should 
Te bolstered.
Bso, draft 
licks Jumbo 
jgiot and Eric 
foore will help 
(fabilize the 
iass protection 
or Phil Simms.
^-All-Pro tight 
md Mark Bavtro, Lionel 
ianuel and 
tfark Ingram 
3re part of a 
leep receiving 
ore that have 
iveral danger
ous deep 
Seats.
^Even with
awrence Taylor out on a 30 day 
ospension, the Giants still have 
ie leagues best linebacking core 
by All-Pro Carl Banks and 
ary Reasons.
The Giants look like a force to 
^reckoned with. If the offensive 
ne holds up and the running 
ame remains effective, the 
iants should win the division. 
JVashington Redskins: The 
pending Super Bowl champs are 
Iddenly in trouble with the loss 
Doug Williams and an untested 
ack-up QB in Mark Rypien. The
trade of quarterback Jay Schroeder seems to have backfired with 
the injury to Williams.
The emergence of running back 
Timmy Smith and the presence of 
dangerous receivers like Gary 
Clark and Art Monk, the Redskins 
will have no problem putting 
points on the board. In addition, 
the acquisition of All-Pro Leonard 
Marshall lessens the severity of 
the loss of Dexter Manley on a 30 
day drug suspension.
The tough defensive line is bal
anced by the best secondary in 
the NFC. Comerback Darrel 
Green leads a secondary that does 
not give up the big play and spe
cializes in safety blitzes. The
BWlSitrtfuvs r0-23-80 
Redskinstough schedule because An improved 
of winning the division last year 
will hurt them down the stretch.
Washington will finish second and 
get a wild-card berth.
Philadelphia Eagles: The 
emergence of All-Pro Reggie 
White spearheads a frightening 
pass rush. The secondary 
struggled last year and must 
improve for the Eagles to be a 
post-season contender.
Quarterback Randall Cunning
ham has improved and is now a 
prime time passing threat. With
All-Pro Mike Quick, Chris Carter 
and running back Keith Byars, 
Philadelphia has a balanced at
tack and will cause problems for 
defenses.
This is the year for the Eagles to 
gel and they may make the play
offs depending on how well they 
do in conference games. Regard
less of the playoffs, the Eagles 
will finish third.
Dallas Cowboys: In a tough 
division, the Cowboys just dont 
have the manpower to play with 
Washington or New York. Quar
terback Steve Pelleur is unproven, 
so the offensive scheme will cen
ter around Herschel Walker and 
wide receiver Michael Irvin.
Irvin looks 
like a genuine 
threat, and 
Walker will 
get his 100 
yards, but the 
defense will 
have a tough 
time keeping 
Dallas from 
getting blown 
out. An old and 
injured defen
sive line com
bined with a 
weak secon^ 
dary spells big 
trouble.
Phoenix 
Cardinals: 
offensive line 
coupled with an All-Pro quarter
back Neil Lomax, promises to be 
entertaining, if nothing else.
Wide receiver J.T. Smith led 
the NFL with 91 receptions and is 
a consistent deep threat. Run
ning back Stump Mitchell is 
steady and effective either as a 
blocker or as a runner. There is no 
relief for the Cardinals playing in 
a tough division where their best 
chance for victory is a shootout. 
Last place is likely unless Dallas 
collapses.

The Womens Tennis team 
wrapped up a successful fall sea
son with a 4-1 record in the Presi
dential Athletic Conference. The 
team looks forward to winter 
training and preparation for the 
University Athletic Association 
Tournament in the spring.
The team was content with its 
performance this season despite 
the two close losses to Grove City 
(4-5 in September and 18-19 in 
the PAC tournament).
Mary Beth Ashbaugh, the #3 
seed, played many tough matches 
this season but still retained a 
positive attitude. Overall we had 
a good season. We did well at the 
PACs. It was a really close battle, 
she said.
The #1 doubles team of Suzy 
Dottor and Beth Cavanaugh had 
an especially successful season, 
only losing to John Carroll. They 
finished by winning at the PAC 
tournament for the third consecu
tive year.
Cavanaugh, also the teams #2 
singles player, earned Most Valu
able Player title for the PAC
Tournament. Dottor reflected on 
the year positively, I think we 
had a good season against the 
PAC teams, especially. 
Sophomore Alice Garber, the 
#4 singles player, felt more 
strongly about their loss. We 
should have won the PACs. We 
were just as good as Grove City, 
Garber stated.
Head Coach Julie Babler was 
satisfied with the teams perform
ance. I thought it went pretty 
well. I feel bad that we lost the 
tournament by only one point. It 
really could have gone either way. 
But I was really proud of the team. 
They gave it everything they had. 
It was a good season. I thought 
everyone pretty much improved. 
The team enjoyed working with 
their new coach and are looking 
forward to more training with her. 
Garber spoke for the team and 
commented, We loved our coach. 
She was very good for the team. 
Dottor agreed, I thought she was 
a real help to us this year. She 
helped us do a lot of conditioning 
and sprints and I think that 
helped make us allva lot faster. 
Hard work is not over yet for 
the Lady Tartans as they look
forward to the spring season anci 
the UAA Tournament. The team 
will travel to Emory University in 
Atlanta for the tournament.
In order to stay in shape for the 
tournament, the team will begirt 
practicing at the Pittsburgh Rac
quet Club in Monroeville this 
winter. Garber eagerly awaits 
working with their new coach. 
We are really excited about the 
year-round training.
Coach Babler is especially look
ing forward to training this win
ter. Unlike the fall season, th 
spring season allows the benefits 
of longer preparation time. Sh 
explained, It was hard in the 
beginning. We were pressed to 
begin the matches right away. 
And I didnt want to change 
anyones strokes rights away. : 
The winter months will give the 
coach and the team the opportu
nity to work more on improving 
strokes and new strategies. Ba
bler has some new techniques in 
store for the team. Were going to 
brush up on things we need to. Its 
going to be a building type period 
where were going to work on 
conditioning and different strater 
gies.

L14The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  25 October 1988
Volleyball slipping fast in PAC
By NATALIE HAWRYLUK
Tartan Assistant Sports Editor
The Carnegie Mellon Womens Volleyball team 
continued its slump last week, losing to John 
Carroll, Washington & Jefferson and Penn StateBehrend.
Last Thursday, the team travelled to W & J to 
take on the First Ladies and Penn State-Behrend. 
CMUs first match of the evening was against 
the powerful hitters of PennState-Behrend (10- 
25 overall). The Lady Tartans played well, but 
were unable to break service. In the first game, 
any player that was able to serve one point for 
Behrend added a minimum of three points to the 
teams score. Behrend took the game, 15-7.
Carnegie Mellon came back behind the fine 
serving of senior Diane Watson and sophomore 
Cindy Peperak. They combined for 11 points, 
and the Lady Tartans won the second game, 15-
9.
Behrend started the third game with seven 
quick points. Later, CMU junior Kris Loh stepped 
up to the service line and tied the game at 7-7.
Behrends Becky Auchter all but dashed the 
hope of a Lady Tartan victory with six straight 
serves to pull Behrend within two points of 
winning the match. Her teammate, Michele 
Mallory, finished off the Lady Tartans, 15-7.
Offensively, CMU was led by junior Laurie 
Shumaker. She recorded five kills and nine as
sists in the match. Watson and Peperak had four 
serving aces each, with Loh adding three more.
Peperak and freshman Deb Perry led the de
fensive attack with two solo blocks each.
The Lady Tartans then played the First La
dies of W&J. In their first meeting of the season, 
CMU won the match in five games.
In this match, the lead changed hands five 
times in the first game. W&J started pulling 
away, but four consecutive serves by Shumaker 
brought the Lady Tartans within a point, 11-10. 
But, this was not enough to slow the First Ladies 
down. They defeated Carnegie Mellon, 15-10.
W&J took an early lead in the second game,
2-0. CMU managed to tie the game at seven, but 
the First Ladies regained the lead on the serving 
of Dina Albano.
The Lady Tartans threatened several times to 
come back, but couldnt muster the needed of
fense, as W & J won the second game, 15-10.
We didnt play as poorly as we did [last week]

Freshman Deb Perry dives for the ball in action 
against W&J last Thursday night.
against Grove City, said Watson.
Watson led the Lady Tartans with five kills 
and three serving aces.
Peperak recorded two solo blocks and two 
block assists, while committing four blocking er
rors. On her inability to block W&J, Peperak 
stated, If you peek around a comer and some
one hits you in the face with a sledgehammer, 
you shouldnt peek around again.
Friday, the Lady Tartans travelled to Cleve
land to face Presidents Athletic Conference 
leader John Carroll. The Lady Blue Streaks 
took the match in three games (18-16,15-7,15- 
11xO
Our blocking was great. We just couldnt hit, 
commented Head Coach Sue Flaherty.
The Lady Tartans recorded 16 solo blocks, 10 
of them by sophomore Nicole Hanak, and 30 
digs.
The team leader on offense was Perry with 12 
kills. Shumaker had 23 assists.
Carnegie Mellons season continues with 
matches against Thiel and Allegheny tomorrow 
night starting at 6:00 pm at Thiel, and the Uni
versity Athletic Associ ation Championship Tour
nament this Friday and Saturday at the Skibo 
Gym. Matches start at noon on Friday and 9:00 
am on Saturday.
Crunch Bunch repeats as Major; 
champion, defeats Beta 20-14
By KEVIN BARNEY
Tartan Staffwriter
Whoever wins today will kill 
Beta, said one Crunch Bunch 
player last Tuesday, as ATO 
battled Crunch Bunch for the 
chance to play Beta in the cham
pionship game.
The first half opened with the 
battle of the quarterbacks. ATOs 
Jim Camp completed four out of 
ten passes with one interception, 
while his Crunch Bunch counter
part, Robert Bowie, completed five 
out of eight passes with a touch
down thrown to Barry Franklin. 
The first half ended with Crunch 
Bunch up, 7-0.
Camp had a brilliant perform
ance in the second half. He com
pleted twelve out of seventeen 
passes, three for touchdowns. 
Bowie, on the other hand, started 
to slip up. He only completed six 
of twelve with two TD passes. 
With 1:40 left in the game, Camp 
threw his second touchdown pass 
of the game to put ATO on top by 
a score of 19-13.
Bowie took his offensive unit 
down the field and scored on a 
pass to Bill Jones, to put Crunch 
Bunch in the lead, 20-19.
With just under a minute left 
on the clock, Camp started mov
ing downfield. On third and long, 
he hit Chris Koscho in the endzone 
to put ATO up by five.
.Thirty-eight seconds remained 
when Bowie and his team went 
back on offense. On the first play, 
Bowie was sacked for a loss. With 
the clock still running, Bowie went 
to the air to find Jones in the 
endzone. The extra point failed 
but Crunch Bunch didnt need it, 
winning by a score of 26-25.
The victory allowed Crunch 
Bunch to advance to the Champi
onship game to face Beta.
Earlier this season, Beta beat

Tough defense contained the 
Bears scoring threats and goalie 
Glen Hoogerwerf, whose 1.31 
goals-against average is third 
among PAC goalies, made sev
eral key saves to preserve a Tar
tan victory.
On Wednesday, the Tartans 
shut down and shut out St. 
Vincents 2-0. It was the first 
shutout of the year for Hooger
werf who played an excellent game 
despite poor playing conditions. 
Rain and hail fell all afternoon, 
but did not dampen the spirits of 
the Tartans.
CMUs Doug Jotzke scored the 
first Tartan goal off of a George 
Gaughan feed. It was all the 
Tartans needed to win in a lop
sided game during which St. 
Vincents mustered few scoring 
threats.
The other Tartan score came on 
a Chris Kasabach corner kick. 
Freshman Alan Horn headed the 
ball past the St. Vincents goal
keeper to round out CMUs scor
ing.
On Sunday, the Tartans had 
yet another shut-out win, beating 
Washington & Jefferson 3-0. This 
win upped the teams record to 8-

Crunch Bunch predicted a blow
out of Beta. The first half saw a 
touchdown by both teams leaving 
them tied at the half, 7-7.
The second half opened with 
Heskamp intercepting a Bowie 
pass. Beta was unable to capital
ize on the turnover and they were 
forced to give the ball back to 
Crunch Bunch.
On their next drive, Bowie ran 
the ball in from midfield to put 
Crunch Bunch up by six. Heskamp 
and his offensive unit couldnt get 
the football to go anywhere and 
Crunch Bunch took over again.
Bowie scored on a touchdown to

In the IM Football Intermedi

SAE quarterback, brought his 
team to victory by keeping the

ther team could manage to score.
Hoehl, who only completed thre 
of eleven in the first half, con 
pleted the first five passes h 
threw in the second half, the. laone for the only touchdown in th 
game.
The SAE pressure was so toug 
that the Sudsuckers could n(

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  25 October 1988L15

rLady Tartans will defend 
PAC title this weekend
By ROBIN HENSENGER
JTartan Staffwriter
The Carnegie Mellon 
Womens Cross Country team 
is preparing for a tough battle 
V'{his Saturday at the Presidents 
?nAthletic Conference Champiri Unships (PAC). The Lady Tar:0t'ans will be competing for their 
fourth consecutive PAC cham
pionship here at CMU.
John Carroll will be the greatb est competition for the Tartan 
women. John Carrolls top two 
banners, Mary Pusateri, and 
r Heather Peltier will provide the 
most competition, says CMU 
^coach Dario Donatelli. There 
are three other women with a 
shot to win: Carnegie Mellons 
top two runners, Kristin Burgard and Sue Johnson and 
Thiels top runner, Dana Butts.
Donatelli states that his team 
has the most depth of CMU 
teams in the past. Two fresh
man, Carolyn Lowe, and Lois 
Ijtaska have been really con
tributing to the team this year. 
Roseanna Neupauer, who has 
h^een running for CMU only 
one year, has demonstrated 
leadership qualities as a sen
ior.
The fact that the team is run
ning on its home course will 
definitely pull us through, 
ays coach Donatelli. The 
courses at John Carroll and 
Grove City are essentially flat 
which gives the Lady Tartans 
an advantage on Schenley 
Parks hills.
; One of the reasons that the 
coach has the women running 
(jn the trails of Schenley Park
is because he feels that run
ning on dirt and cinders has 
reduced the amount of inju
ries. The women have had very 
little in the way of injuries 
this year, says Donatelli. If 
someone gets hurt now, he said 
that he will get them healthy 
before PACs one way or an
other.
Donatelli ran cross country 
for Carnegie Mellon and says 
that this helps him coach the 
women. He states that cross 
country is totally different for 
the-men and the women.
Most of the runners come 
from high school teams where 
one coach handled both the 
mens and womens teams, and 
often neglected the women. 
Since the women do not have a 
strong background in running, 
they are not as confident about 
their performance as the men 
are. Donatelli says, they have 
a lot of potential and a desire to 
run well. This has pulled them 
through.
As a coach, Donatelli has 
taken a step back and real
ized that he must train the 
women differently from the way 
he was trained.Since some of 
them did not know the proper 
way to warm-up, he spent time 
teaching them how. In order to 
teach the Lady Tartans what 
to eat before a meet, Donatelli 
made them dinner the night 
before a race, which soon be
came a tradition for the team. 
He says that the women are 
very close and they do things 
together outside of running. 
Perhaps this is what makes 
them run well together.
Runners looking for ninth conference championship...
yEb,t doVtt dVrbpoT uJhh 2Vtp m8 pJphE REEp
By ROBIN HENSINGER
Tartan Staffwriter
This weekend CMU will host 
the Cross Country Presidents 
Athletic Conference Champion
ships (PAC). The mens team has 
won eight straight PAC champi
onships in the past ten years.
The success of the team, which 
ranked a sensational 9th in the 
country last year, has been largely 
attributed to the 
dedication of the 
runners and the 
hard work of Head 
Coach Gary Meckley.
Carnegie Mellon 
will compete on its 
home course on Oc
tober 29 against six 
other schools: Be
thany College,
Grove City College,
Hiram College, John 
Carroll University,
Thiel College, and Washington & 
Jefferson College. The Tartan run
ners, who have one of the best 
records in CMU history, will be 
stiff competition for the other 
schools.
According to Coach Meckley, 
Grove Citys talented runners will 
be the Tartans toughest oppo
nent. The Grove City team con
sists of only seven men in com
parison to CMUs twenty run
ners.
All three of our top men must 
have outstanding races in order 
to win, and even then I will be 
holding my breath, says John 
Barr, the Grove City coach. His 
top three runners are juniors Vem 
Anderson and Matt Kraeuter, and 
senior John Hennee. Hennee, 
coming off an injury, ran 26:50 at 
their last meet.
The other five schools will not 
be stiff competition for CMU and 
Grove City. John Carroll and 
Hiram will be competingfor third 
place, says the John Carroll 
coach. He hopes to have their top 
runner, sophomore Mark Waner, 
come in the top ten. Top runners 
for Hiram are freshman Derek 
Stem and senior John Karban.
The team has a lot of depth 
this year, and that will help at
PACs, says Coach Meckley. Con
tributing to this are: 1986 PAC 
champ, junior Dave Supp; re
gional champs, senior Pat Noll 
and junior Gary Harrison; and 
national qualifiers, seniors Tom 
Ford and Kevin Helm, and jun
iors Gary Meeker, Len ONeal and 
Tim Berger.
One of Meckleys major concerns 
this season has been the health of 
the team. Helm, one of the Tartan 
top runners, is out for the rest of 
the season due to illness.
There are, however, three fresh
men that could contribute greatly 
to the team at the PACs: Mike 
Damon, Jon Frieder and John 
Byrnes. Damon seemed to step 
out in front at the beginning of 
the season, but an ankle injury 
set him back.
Although most of the men were
not superstar runners in high 
school, they are successful because 
they work hard and run well 
together, states the coach.
Meckley, a state champion polevaulter, chose to coach cross-coun
try because he respects how much 
dedication and effort they have 
for a sport that does not get much 
recognition. He respects the men 
as runners and as people because 
they study hard and they run be
cause they love it. 
The respect be
tween Meckley 
and the team, is 
mutual, says 
Harrison.
The coach at
tributes their out
standing record 
to the latest re
search tech
niques on run
ning, nutrition, 
and physiology. 
In addition to 
changes in running shoes, Meck
ley has also changed his coaching 
techniques over the past 20 years.
His main objective is to be able 
to know when to work the team 
hard and when to take it easy. He 
has become very sensitive to the 
academic demands placed on the 
runners, and takes that into con
sideration during midterms and 
finals. Meckley says that he 
learned happily that praise gets 
more out of the men than punish
ment.
The runners say that he takes a 
personal interest in each of them 
and deals with them on an indi
vidual basis. He evaluates the 
strengths of the team each year 
and trains the men accordingly.
Meckleys goals for PACs are 
winning the conference and pro
viding a quality meet for those 
competing. He hopes that the six 
schools in the race will come away 
thinking that CMU did a nice 
job with PACs this year.
The last time that the confer
ence was held at CMU was in 
1985, when President Cyert gave 
out the awards to the runners. 
This gesture was well received, 
because it is rare that the presi
dent of the hosting university does 
this.
The meets, up until now, have 
been easy victories for the Tar
tans. The PACs, Eastern Regionals and Nationals are all in the 
next four weeks. These are the 
meets that the men train for all 
season.
The team finished ninth in the 
nation last year and the coach 
feels that they have a good chance 
to do as well this year, if not 
better.
This year should prove to be a 
memorable experience for those 
that attend the PAC meet. The 
race begins on Saturday at 11:00 
am on Flagstaff Hill.
All CMU students and cross
country alumni can come and 
support the team. The alumni 
were invited back to Carnegie 
Mellon to cheer for the Tartans, 
and then attend a reception in 
the Faculty Dining Room, coordi
nated by Dave Maloney of Stu
dent Relations.

Im always looking for something to 
say, and Im always trying to say some
thing about what I see, comments 
sophomore Mary Campbell about art.
As an Art major, Marys day does seem 
to be consumed by creating. She is either 
writing, painting, eating, or sleeping. I 
draw all of the time; I always have my 
sketchbook with me.
Weekday mornings she either has 
classes, plans for her assignments  like 
a film  or reads for her academic 
courses.
She.works in the Art Store two morn
ings a week. Working there has broad
ened her knowledge of materials and, 
she jokes, their cost.
This semester she is taking three studio 
courses  painting, drawing and a
m2VpVt 5T KAec CO Lziwg
Pittsburgh Filmmakers class.
In her painting class, she views slides 
of painters works and talks about art 
and ideas. Mary says that these ideas 
about art, artists, and society are essen
tial. She contrasts this with her freshman 
core classes, which stressed artistic tech
niques. This year she is encouraged 
more to work on her own.
In her drawing class, on the other 
hand, she draws from a model, works on 
an outside assignment, or has critiques 
of her work. Mary is against the concept 
of art assignments. Calling them, anti
art, she doesnt think that ideas can be 
put on deadlines. I dont think [assign
ments] are conducive to art.
I can get ideas anyplace, anywhere, 
she continues, Its just a question of 
What do I want to talk about? Some 
things particularly strike her. My 
intuition is very attuned; Im always 
aware of my environment.
Occasionally she will go to The Came3  j

gie to make sketches. She prefers to 
draw the dinosaurs and animals, which 
arent available in her everyday life. She 
is selective about what she draws: I just 
sketch things that I want to remember, 
that I want to treasure.
Sometimes she eats lunch at Kiltie. But, 
she adds, Sometimes I bring lunch and 
eat at Schenley Park. I always eat in 
obscure places.
Mary, who lives off campus, says she is 
something of a recluse. She enjoys living 
away from school. As a freshman she 
always felt she was a part of school; now 
she feels more independent. In addition, 
her apartment provides her with plenty 
of room for a studio.
Mary feels she is not a typical art 
student and she believes there is no 
typical art student. I think Im more 
serious about my work than a lot of 
other art majors are. Im much more 
interested in changing things.

Theres a lot of work, but its interestng. Thats how Dave Mastorocco 
ihooses to describe his life as a Mechanial Engineering student in CIT.
Dave is a third year Mech E student 
rom Derry, Pa. He chose CMU mainly 
or its reputation as a univerity and its 
Dcation in Pittsburgh and has studied 
lechanical Engineering mainly because 
if its diversity. Its not so 
pecialized...You can do a lot with it. 
Dave lives on Fifth Avenue with his 
lousemates Keith (an Information 
ystems major), Rachel (Indusrtrial 
lanagement), and John (a transferred 
heatre Production Major).
He describes himself as a sports fan, 
larticularly football, and enjoys attendng sporting events both in Pittsburgh 
ind his hometown. My brother is 
laying football in high school  I like
o go home on the weekends to watch
him play. He enjoys all types of food, 
calling himself a meatnpotatoes man 
at heart. His favorite type of music 
consists of the Rolling Stones, Pink 
Floyd, and any good 60s rock and roll. 
Although he has no 
Greek affiliations or 
extracurricular 
activities, he is inter
ested in the intramu
ral sports program 
and plans to play on a 
volleyball team this 
year.
A typical day in 
Daves life at CMU consists of a morning 
of classes (Mech Es love the morning) 
from 8:30 till 12:30 ranging from Thermo 
Dynamics II, Numerical Methods, and 
20th Century America (part of an H&SS 
in-depth sequence).
After the morning block of classes,
Dave either goes home to take care of 
personal business (banking, grocery 
shopping, sleeping, etc.), or goes on to 
an afternoon of labs on Tuesdays, 
Wednesdays, and Thursdays. The labs 
require a lot of 66

RVobJbM VF dhIttEt 
('yEd2 wjt hVlE p2E

time and work. 
You have to get 
together with 
other people and 
its tough to 
organize. Labs 
are usually over 
by 4:30 and that 
leaves time-to go 
home, relax, and settle in for about 8 
hours of studying. The main bulk of the 
work is problem sets. Every week theres 
two or three, one of which could easily 
take fifteen hours to do.
After the week is over, Dave usually 
feels the need to stay away from cam
pus. Its great to get away...Were on 
campus 4-7 hours a day, you work about
8 hours a day, and its good just to let it 
drop and not worry about it. Although 
in previous years he and his friends 
often spent weekend nights at the 
fraternities, Dave and his friends prefer 
to spend time in small groups, watching 
movies, or having larger parties at their 
house off-campus. They also spend a lot 
of time road-tripping to other campuses, 
such as Ohio State, Penn State, and West 
Virginia.
When asked to summarize what its 
like to be a Mech E at CMU, Dave 
replied, Its interesting, it involves a lot 
of work, but I enjoy it. It has a lot of 
practical uses that let you be as diverse 
as you choose to be.

A
Mellon College of Science attracts 
some of the best students because of its 
reputation in Math and Computer 
Science, according to one Applied 
Math/Computer Science major. Edward 
Rovner, a Phi Kap brother, is a senior in 
Carnegie Mellons Mellon College of 
Science. He believes that often, very 
intelligent students in high school have a 
tendency not to put much effort into 
schoolwork and still receive decent 
grades. However, 
after coming to 
CMU, these same 
students begin to 
work hard because 
theyve found 
their niche." This 
is true of MCS stu
dents as well as the 
other colleges 
within Carnegie 
Mellon. Ed also 
thinks that many students, feel smug 
when they first come here, until theyre 
thrown in with other people having 
the same interests, and the same level of 
intelligence.
In Carnegie Mellon, MCS students 
finally get to focus all that unused energy 
leftover from high school on the work 
theyre interested in: theoretical science. 
Ed says that MCS students are more 
interested in how a science is devel
oped. He compares it to CIT: In MCS 
we wonder more about why things are 
the way they are, while in engineering 
they don't, they just need to use it 
[science] for something practical. In the 
real world, few 
people may care 
about the theory 
of a science but 
someone (perhaps 
an MCS student) 
had to develop the 
theory of the 
science before it 
could be used for 
anything. He 
went on to state 
that occasionally scientists may discover 
something that contributes very little as a 
practical tool, but later on down the 
road it may be used for something. MCS 
looks at [science] differently, we dont

always have a practical view in mind. 
Ed further explained, however, that 
not all MCS majors are that far from the 
real world. All the applied majors, 
such as Applied Physics or Applied 
Math, are in between pure theory and 
realistic usefulness. So, according to Ed, 
although focusing primarily on the 
theoretical development of science, MCS 
still has a grasp on science as a tool 
which can be used for practical pur
poses.

Dnrfl'H&SS
H&SS senior Amy Stevenson is a 
twenty-one-year-old Professional Writing 
and Applied History double major. 
Although she comes from Pittsburgh and 
a relatively large family which includes 
two sisters and two brothers, an apart
ment in Shadyside shared with two 
roommates is more convenient during the 
school year. Her apartment is closer to 
classes and to her job at the Electrical & 
Computer Engineer
ing department (ECE) 
where she helps out 
as a work-study.
Amys life as an 
H&SS student is busy, 
but fun. Her schedule 
is full with five 
English classes (Rhetoric, Critical Theory, 
Film: Youth Cultures, Magazine Writing, 
and Non-Fiction Workshop), but in 
between these committments she finds 
plenty of time to spend relaxing with 
friends. On a typical day, we find Amy:
8:30: Wake Up Time. Well, maybe just 
a few more minutes  hits the snooze 
button.
9:15: Walk to School. Generally this 
takes about fifteen minutes, just enough 
time to get to class. Amy likes to walk 
reading The New York Times. She shares 
the subscription with a roommate and 
reads^ the paper every day.
9:30: First Class  Rhetoric. The class 
often discusses politics, one of Amys 
interests and one to which she would like 
to devote.more time, so generally she is 
attentive and finds it interesting.
11:30: Next Class  Non-Fiction 
Workshop. This one is usually interesting 
as well, although like any class it has its 
low points. Amy dislikes reading Erma 
Bombecky pieces with subjects like 
How Much I Hate Washing Dishes but 
enjoys the unusual pieces such as one 
describing the differences between blacks 
and whites in religious services. The class 
illustrates one of Amys criticisms of the 
English department ; she fears the 
English department is becoming too big" 
and too structured. A student becomes 
an English major having taken very few 
English classes and then must immedi
ately know" what it is she wants to do.
To Amy, writing is a skill and an art which 
many do not fully appreciate. The depart
ment accepts many non-writing major 
students who simply cant write as well 
and therefore classes are overcrowded 
and difficult to get into. No one fails a 
writing class, you get an A, B, or a C. 
Amy feels that perhaps some fair lower . 
grades Would alleviate the problem.
1:00: Lunch Time. Shes back to the
library to meet friends  time for fun 
and relaxing.
1:30: Work. Amys off to the ECE. 
Theres not always a lot to do here, and 
her hours are flexible so Amy some
times manages to get some homework 
done here as well. She enjoys her job, 
copying, filing, running errands, etc. 
and doesnt feel the pressure of an 
overload of work.
5:00: Two 
Hours to Class.
Back to the 
library to do 
some more 
reading and then 
to dinner with a 
group of friends. 
They can never agree on where to eat, 
Amy laughs, so its never certain.
7:00: Last Class  Magazine Writ
ing. This class is interesting too, says 
Amy, and shes learned a lot about her 
writing. But sometimes we learn things 
we dont have to learn, if you know 
what I mean. A lot of it is opinion. Amy 
enjoyed reading and analyzing Carne
gie Magazine, but felt a half hour spent 
critiquing a students article could have 
been reduced.
8:30: Homework. Usually in the 
library, until 11:00 or 12:00, Amy stays 
to finish up her assignments and 
anything for which she has to be on 
campus. Amy does homework every 
week night, saving Fridays and Satur
days for relaxing.
12:00: Going Home. Usually its the 
shuttle, and usually with Ollie (ask her).
12:15: At Home. Amy is usually still 
awake and watches reruns of Threes 
Company and The Odd Couple. She 
finds these shows much more enjoyable 
than those in most prime time slots and 
rarely watches drama. When shes not 
watching TV, she reads for pleasure, 
having just finished Flannery 
OConnors Wise Blood. Other favorite 
authors include J.D. Salinger and 
Raymond Carver. Before getting in bed, 
Amy writes in her journal, a daily 
activity, unless Im really tired.
So this is what its like as an H&SS 
college student. As for the future, Amy 
plans to become certified as a public 
school teacher in English or History  a 
teacher because she likes children, and 
its a way to keep learning, and a 
public school because everyone wont 
be wealthy, smart, etc. Ultimately, Amy 
hopes to become a professor.

student then presents and defends his/ 
her thesis before a committee of faculty 
and staff.
Most funding comes from awards and 
research stipends for three years, but 
some earn money through paid research 
and teaching.
Linda now works from 10 to 15 hours a 
week on computer programs at PPG in 
downtown Pittsburgh and spends most 
of her time in the library or trailer 
reading and gathering information about 
her dissertation topic.
Linda finds the hardest part of the grad 
program to be the constant pressure of 
the PhD project. Because of the loose 
structure, a grad student must have selfdiscipline and be able to work with no 
regular feedback. Undergrads can take 
tests, write papers, get immediate 
concrete results, and start anew each 
semester. For grad students, research 
projects take years, which can be 
frustrating and uncertain because you 
can never fully solve a problem, but only 
a small piece.
Some grad students have the ABD (All 
But Dissertation) syndrome  they 
have trouble pulling together the huge 
floating bubble of research and wrap
ping it up with a healthy there's always 
a new approach, but here's what I've
done attitude.
For Linda, the best part of being a grad 
student is trying to make sense of the 
world by unravelling problems and 
working with people who share mutual 
interests. She describes grad students as 
a small, close-knit group of friends who 
provide support. Linda thinks the sense 
of togetherness already among the 
wonderful people she works with 
would be more meaningful if there were 
more interaction across all colleges.
Linda, who has been married for three 
years, explains that such intense work 
and the constant plodding pace are 
tough on spouses and significant others 
because you can never put the work 
away. To relieve pressure, Linda likes to 
travel on short trips, to physically get 
away from work.
Linda advises would-be grad students 
to have a burning desire to be in an aca
demic environment (both her parents 
were CMU faculty members, so she 
should know about academic environ
ments) and to be excited about pulling 
apart detailed pieces of research prob
lems in an efort to make sense of and 
improve the world.
For Linda Graziano, a third year 
graduate student in the Graduate School 
of Industrial Administration (GSIA), 
school is largely working together on 
interesting problems. She graduated 
from CMU with a degree in Managerial 
Economics and worked for three years 
as a project manager.
According to Linda, the four-year PhD 
program involves classwork, a teaching 
requirement, major research papers, a 
qualifyng exam, and summer internships 
in roughly the first two years.
This past summer she worked on a 
project analyzing the structure of promo
tions inside organizations, specifically 
the formal, projected line of promotions 
versus the actual promotions.
In the third year, most time is spent 
reading research journals, discussing 
research ideas, running experiments, 
and gathering data. All this gathering 
input helps define a do-able problem 
which the student can develop into a 
thesis, with the guidance of an advisor 
and a committee of three faculty mem
bers. The next step is to write a pro
posal explaining how to approach the 
problem. Here, Linda explains, is where 
interaction is so important to refining 
and critiquing the thesis, as well as col
lecting and interpreting data. The

Its still dark and cold out, hut's time to 
get up. Its 5:30 am, and that leaves only 
a half hour before my meeting with Dr. 
William Elliott, Vice President of Enroll
ment. As I walk into his office at 6 am, I 
find he and Michael Murphy busily 
working. He greets me with a cheery 
good morning, offers me a cup of coffee 
he just made, and tells me hes been here 
since 4:45 in the morning. This man is 
either very dedicated to his work, or a 
little bit crazy!
Elliott Loves Carnegie Mellon. This is 
evident not only through his 12 and 13 
hour days, but by making it a point to 
get out and see that which he oversees. 
He is Vice President for Enrollment, so 
he spent a full day on this past sleeping 
bag weekend interviewing applicants. 
Elliott told me, I get a lot of business 
done on campus...walking to other 
meetings and talking to faculty, adminis
trators, and students on the way. Its 
important for people to realize that Im a 
part of the university, not just holed up 
in this office.
Speaking about his office, there are 
two very distinct parts of a day in the life 
of Dr. Elliott. One is a green pen, the 
other his door. The green pen is his
trademark. If you ever get a letter written 
in thick green marker, you dont even 
have to read the signature. The door is 
his history, his life. Theres so much 
junk you gather in day to day living that 
you just cant throw away, but you dont 
know where to file it. So, I pul it on my 
door. It contains such things as badges, 
buttons, photos, nameplates, letters, a 
detailed history of the man many layers 
thick. It goes back to 1979, probably 
earlier."
Elliott is also the acting director of 
athletics, has a private counseling 
business on the side, and teaches 
Sunday school. He assured me, I always 
have time for students. Theyre the most 
important resource on this campus.
The obvious question I had for Dr. 
Elliott was, How do you do it?" He 
replied, How do students do what they 
do on this campus? I always see lights on 
in student dorms when I come in in the 
morning, and I know there are a lot of 
all-nighters out there. How do I do it? I 
want to. He compared it to education: 
Education is just putting yourself in 
control of your environment. You can go 
wherever you want to go, and if youre 
dedicated, youll make it.
That's not the only side to Elliott 
however. His favorite phrase is, When
ever I grow up, I want to be a cabinet
maker. He has a rather extensive wood
working shop and has created a lot of 
furniture. Elliott also likes to attend Car
negie Mellon sports and tries regularly to 
attend football games.
There just isn't enough time...never 
enough time.

When you think of public relations, 
you dont get a better definition on this 
campus than Don Hale. He eagerly wel
comed me into his office as he put down 
one of the half dozen newspapers he 
reads each morning, propped his feet up 
on his desk, leaned back in his chair, 
and casually asked, Whats up?
When asked about a day in the life of 
Don Hale, Assistant Vice President for 
Public Relations, he smiled, Thats easy; 
?ajjg| Its very routine.- Leave home around
 6am, pick up coffee and a copy of USA
Today at the Uni Mart. Pick up the 
Times, the Post, and a few other news
papers on the doorstep of the office, 
read them until 8. Talk to the media 
when they get up around 11 or 12. Talk 
to the TV stations around 4 or 5 in the 
afternoon for the evening news, run at 
lunchtime (I ALWAYS run at lunchtime) 
and do my administrative work in 
between." He added, There are always 
last minute events, emergencies, and so 
on that come up  thereve been many 
late nights.
One of the best parts of Hales job is 
the reading. He reads many newspa
pers, news magazines, and publications 
and tries to integrate the news or events 
into Carnegie Mellon. The University is 
widely published and noted worldwide.
Hales wife, Tamara Dieter-Hale, works 
two floors above him as Associate 
Director of Alumni Relations. Its kinda 
nice  we work out well together!" In 
his spare time, besides spending time 
with his wife, Hale loves watching sports 
on TV, runs as much as possible, and 
plays endless softball in the summer. 
As I left, I asked Hale what he thought 
of Carnegie Mellon. He replied with the 
smile that never left his face throughout 
my visit, I like the school. I love the 
people, the intensity, and how driven it 
is. In a nutshell, it fits my personality!

ADMINISTRATION
Mike Steidel, Director of Admissions, 
invited me into his office during his 
lunch hour to chat about a day in his life. 
He asked Do you mind if we talk while 
I sign? There was a stack of about 1000 
letters on his desk to students who 
received National Merit Scholarships, 
and he was hand signing each one. He 
later told me the office was sending out 
13,000 such letters, all of which he 
would personally sign. So much for my 
question about dedication.
Steidel truly enjoys his work. Every 
day is different. One day may be filled 
with office work, the next may be 
nothing but talking to people. There's a 
real diversity here, with no two days 
alike, he smiled. He puts himself on the 
interviewing schedule so he can keep in 
tune with the flavor of whats going on 
in the office. Mikes a manager, but 
believes in leadership by example.
His day starts early, usually around
