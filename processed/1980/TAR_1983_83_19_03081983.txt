Exam schedule 
is "finalized"
By PAULINE WEN
Tartan Assistant News Editor
After much debate, a compromise has 
been reached between the Faculty Senate 
and the Student Senate concerning the finals 
schedule change. Faculty Senate passed the 
resolution two weeks ago, with the Student 
Senate granting approval last Tuesday.
The new finals schedule is:
1) Classes on Wednesday;
2) Reading days on Thursday and 
Friday;
3) Morning, afternoon, and evening 
finals on Saturday;
4) Afternoon and evening finals on 
Sunday;
5) Morning, afsanoon, and evening 
finals Monday through Thursday.
The change came about through student 
opinion that one reading day is insufficient. 
The compromise was hampered because the 
faculty did not want to cancel Wednesday 
classes, the students did not want Friday 
finals, and six days of finals still had to be fit 
into the week.

future, commented Alexandra Kavoulakis,

Art students' canvas of studies shrinking
Is the administration phasing out the art 
department? From recent events, it seems the 
administradon is trying to do away with the 
department, piece by piece.
According to the art students, CFA Dean 
Akram Midani wants to remove fibers and 
combine several programs, such as metals, 
ceramics and glass blowing, into one program.
These changes would hurt the students currendy in these programs. By Friday, a decision 
may be made concerning the fibers program, 
which will decide the fates of the students, as 
well as Diane Samuels, the only person on 
campus who teaches fibers. Samuels is a visit
ing artist, so her contract is renewed each year.
One of the strengths of the art department is 
its diversity. Students are exposed to many dif
ferent art forms, and they then decide for them
selves which are most valuable. To restrict the 
offerings to this degree is to directly counter 
this strength.
Art is a subjective area, very much depend
ent on individual judgement. It would appear 
Midani is trying to force his own aesthetic 
judgements on the students of the department 
by removing a program he has deemed unim
portant. Such decisions are supposed to be
made by the department faculty, not Dean 
Midani himself; it is questionable how 
informed the faculty is on the pending 
decision.
Fibers is currendy a degree program, just 
like professional writing or applied math is. 
However, Midani would like to remove it, 
effective immediately. Will the students who 
are currendy enrolled in this program gradu
ate with the degree they originally sought? 
More importandy, what will the BFA mean in 
ten years if the department is trimmed down in 
this way?
The art students are not taking this pending 
decision lightly, and have circulated a petition 
asking the department to reconsider this move. 
Over 200 fine arts students have signed this 
petition, as have a number of concerned engi
neers and humanities students. Art students 
have formed a department Student Advisory 
Council, which they are trying to have recog
nized as the official department SAC, and have 
talked to both faculty and students to raise 
support. Midani may have been counting on 
student apathy to push the decision through, 
but the SAC could stand in his way.
The elimination of a degree program with
almost no notice is a bad move on the universal 
tys part. The administration has failed 
inform the students who will be affected, maJ 
ing a decision with almost no time for considJ 
eration. In the past, decisions of 
magnitude have taken months, such as in tfJ 
proposed removal of the illustration progj 
and the question of a major in video. If ty 
decision is made on Friday as expected, it will I 
have been made after only a few weeks of 
discussion.
The students are obviously not apathetic;! 
they were simply not informed of the pending! 
decision. However, they have been able to aj 
quickly and should be given the chance 
influence this decision.
Let the students address the faculty before 
they have the chance to vote the fibers program] 
out of existence Friday. Let these students preJ 
ent their point of view, which the department! 
administration has obviously not sought, 
short, let them have some input into theii| 
education.
We are not asking that the students make! 
final decision but only they be granted 
input that President Cyert claims all students| 
have through their departments SACs.

Dear Constituents,
Since tomorrow and Thursday are elec
tion days, I felt it best to not write a column 
today. As a fairly minded candidate, I do not
* wish to abuse executive privilege by campaigning for my reelection in this column. Since 
this column was initiated to 
provide a conduit for the interchange of 
intellectual comments, compliments and 
complaints, I felt that its use as a political 
device (weapon) was playing dirty. (It took 
my roommates a full 6 days to convince me 
of this.) So today I am introducing another 
new feature to this column. It is titled Your 
Turn. Guest columnist/advertiser(s) will 
be invited to discuss burning issues of the 
day. Todays guests are Joe Reds and P.F. 
Johnston. See you at the polls.
Love and kisses, 
Nate
P.S. Dont forget to vote tomorrow or 
Thursday. Vote early and often.
[Act One. The Beginning]
Okay, youve heard the rumors, maybe 
youve seen an ad, maybe even you were one
of the lucky few who registered while the 
event was still in its fetal stages. Now its 
official. Today we announce... the signing 
of Herschel Walker . . . er . . . the WIN A 
DATE WITH NATE CONTEST!!!!! Yes 
girls, weve noticed the hot monkey lust in 
your eyes when you snatch a peek at him 
gliding across campus with cat-like grace. 
Weve noticed how the Senate kow-tows 
before his feet. Weve heard Cyert meekly 
mutter Goofballs under his breath at him. 
Yes folks, the time has come to award the 
campus with another display of charismatic 
silliness.
From the folks who brought you the 
original Nate campaign and the Guide 
Harvesting Republicans Insults comes 
another brainstorm. Beginning Friday, the 
day after you decide whether to re-elect Nate 
or elect some impersoNATEr, you may pick 
up copies of the OFFICIAL WIN A DATE 
WITH NATE CONTEST Questionnaires 
at the Activities Desk in Skibo. The 
complemented questionnaires must be 
returned to the Activities Desk by March 18. 
The winner will be determined by the notso-very independent judging firm of 
Johnston/Keds. All decisions of the judges 
will be final, of course.
Enter your friends and family, everyone is 
welcome to enter. Remember, youve got to 
play to lose.

You claim there is no place for drugs in an

Robert Lewis Stevenson - cocaine; 
Victor Hugo - marijuana and

politics: Pres. William McKinley

John Lennon - etc.; Janis Joplin - 
alcohol, etc.
sciences: Pythagoras - mariji

cocaine; Samuel Colt - whippets,| 
entertainment: Lenny Bruce

Spillane urges students to unite
By Paul Spillane
. . . and from the long, dark tunnel 
appears a faint, but steadily growing light. 
Will it be a big, rumbling, unstoppable 
train, or will it be just the Road Runner 
_ wecnng a coalminers lantern..
P I feel that Im a sufficiently 
removed contributor to The 
Tartan to be able to look at and 
analyze it objectively, and therefore to say 
that, in my opinion, this paper is finally 
beginning to become effective in addressing 
some of the long-standing problems 
inherent in this university. My highest 
(relative) compliments go to the editors and 
the recent editorials which have, of late, so 
effectively pointed out the grave, crippling 
problems of apathy and lack of unity (which 
are in no way unrelated to that 
conspicuouisly lacking building/institution, the Student Union).
For too long the cries erf individual stu
dents like myself and yourselves have been 
just that: cries of individual students. Our 
primary collective voice and idea presen
ter, this paper, has been insufficient in 
addressing these key, recurring issues with 
any measurable clarity, impact, or convic
tion. I know it, you all know it.
We sure bitch to and about The Tartan 
when its poor and inattentive, but can we 
approve it when it gets the job done? Do you 
agree that we have needed a Student Union 
for some time now? If you believe, as I do, 
that this is the closest were going to come to 
having Warner Hall finally take heed of the 
students more urgent requests, then push it 
for all its worth, with letters, ideas, and 
comments to the paper and to the 
administration.
If you want more unity and contact 
between students, then promote it. Do you 
care about apathy? If not, then stay in your
caves, studios, terminal rooms, dorms, and 
frats. If you do care, then do something, 
anything, to remind the administration that 
students are not just an irritation passing 
through, but are kind of like the main pur
pose of this corporation, er, university.

After talking to a number of faculty and 
udents in the art department, I have 
ed that the administration plans to cut 
t the fiber department, phase out Diane 
muels as current instructor of fiber, and 
lentually consolidate metals, glass, and 
ramies into one three-dimensional area. If 
is is so, I am deeply concerned.
I First of all, I am a first year transfer stuInt and was looking forward to having 
iane as a teacher; I have heard nothing but 
things about her from other students, 
eluding that she is one of the best art 
[chers at Camegie-Mellon. Secondly, I was 
so hoping to take fiber as an elective, andI
n very disturbed that it will no longer be 
i option in the fine arts curriculum. 
I nally, I feel that lumping metals, ceramI s and glass into one area would be 
tremely detrimental to me as an art stu
nt, and to the department in general. One 
the things that attracted me to Camegieellon was its different approaches to art 
rough the exposure to various media. Not
only would the art students be deprived of a 
well-rounded, serious art education, but the 
future of art itself at CMU itself would be in 
jeopardy.
I have several questions regarding these 
issues: Why does the administration want to 
discontinue fiber, the most popular threedimensional elective? What are their motiva
tions in changing the three-dimensional 
electives from their separate entities into one 
unit? Are they financial and/or because of 
new computer programs? If so, is it fair that 
vital programs in the art department be cut? 
And what will be next?
I have talked to many students and found 
reactions of shock and dismay, I urge all 
who share my views to voice their concerns 
to the faculty and administration. We must 
organize in an effort to stop these terribly 
inappropriate decisions on the part of the 
administration.

rt dept. SAC reforms in reaction to fibers removal
iiton
I would like to bring to your and your 
ders attention that there are prospects of 
ange in CMUs Art Department. In the 
st few weeks there her been much discus>n among the departments faculty and 
dents about departmental alterations.
Foremost among these prospective 
nges is a phasing out of the Fibers 
partment. Other topics have been future
 iminating of other 3-D areas and a con||lidation of the remaining areas under the
 ading sculpture.
Personally I am extremely upset about the
possibility of any of these changes being 
implemented into my department. I viewed 
a discontinuation of Fibers and other areas 
in the department as detrimental to my 
career here as an art major, to those of my 
fellow students and profoundly to the qual
ity of the art education that CMU will offer 
to future students.
Other students besides myself have 
actively shown their concern regarding 
these matters. A group of us have solicited 
signatures for a petition stating our discont
entment with the idea of losing the Fibers 
department. Our efforts have been met 
with an enthusiastic response, and as a
result, we have here decided to reform the 
Art Departments SAC.
We will be meeting this Wednesday, 
March 9, at 7:30 p.m. in the Lounge. All stu
dents who wish to show their concern about 
these issues by becoming actively involved 
in this organization are invited to attend.
I am also asking all of the Tartans on 
campus readers and subscribers, especially
parents, alumni and trustees to voice their 
opinions regarding these issues. Please 
make them known to Dr. Orville Winsand, 
Art Department Head, Dean Akram Midani 
and President Cyert. Your attention will be 
deeply appreciated by all of those concerned.
Sincerely 
Carolyn Speranza 
Sophomore ArtHypnotism is unscientific

As a senior in the Art Dept., I have witJssed a number of changes occur within 
is university. So far, many decisions have 
made without the input of us, the stuits, due to our apathy.
Thanks to long standing policy we have
 d the opportunity to voice our opinions. 
H iis voice is the Student Advisory CommitI'. The Art Dept. S.A.C. will meet again
tomorrow, March 9, at 7:30 PM in the

One of the lessons from the Vietnam expe

Hypnotism belongs to the same class of 
phenomena as levitation, spoon-bending, 
speedreading, and other kinds of popular 
tomfoolery. There are no identifiable 
changes in brain physiology when one is 
in a hypnotic trance, nor are there any 
detectable changes when one comes out of 
such a state. The only detectable sign of 
being in a trance is a dreamy-eyed, solemn 
appearance, a tendency to speak in a mono
tone voice, and a responsiveness to silly 
questions.
Contrary to the opinion of Janice Nasiadka, hypnotism is not derived from behaviorist psychology. The latter is the domain 
of J.B. Watson and B.F. Skinner, neither of 
whom had much use for the concept of 
mind, let alone hypnotic trances.
Hypnotism is a direct descendent from 
Mesmer and animal magnetism, which 
had its roots in the supposed curative pow
ers of magnets, a practice introduced to 
Mesmer by a priest called, interestingly 
enough, Father Hell. The magnets were 
placed on various body parts, and extracted 
everything from fever to depression. Even 
drinking water and bedding materials were 
magnetized.
To Mesmers credit, he soon discovered 
that he didnt need magnets to effect cures  
just his hands, which contained its own 
magnetic powers (and thus called animal 
magnetism). In the early 1800s, an interna
tional panel of scientists concluded that 
animal magnetism was without scientific 
merit, which, of course, didnt dim its 
popularity.
To mesmerize means to hypnotize. The 
continued popularity of hypnotism proba
bly attests to the desire of even well-educated 
individuals to believe in something 
mystical.

This letter is not necessarily to the editor, 
but to whomever wrote the caption for my 
photo of a gerbil that appeared in page 11 of 
the February 15, 1983 issue of The Tartan.
The caption I am referring to reads: A 
gerbil in the hand is worth two at Kiltie; 
perhaps more in the cancer research lab. I 
think that this type of writing does not 
belong anywhere and I am very upset for the 
following reasons (and for the immediately 
preceding one).
I have no way of knowing the true intent 
of the author of the caption, but I will 
assume that his/her intent is the same as that 
which appears in the surface  one of jest. I 
find no joke in the fact that gerbils are used 
in cancer research labs. I also find no joke in
the association of gerbils with Kiltie. I 
believe that these are serious matters not to 
be dealt with lightly.
Would you find any humor in finding the 
eye of a gerbil in your soup, for example? 
Have you ever been to a cancer research lab? 
I have, and I didnt find any humor in seeing 
animals taken apart in an attempt to 
increase our lifespan.
Please think before you transfer your ideas 
to a piece of paper Any attempt at finding 
humor in the suffering of animals (or 
human beings) reveals a loose screw. I 
suggest that you get out a screwdriver and

Tomorrow CMU students will be voting 
in the spring senatorial and presidential 
elections. At the same time another issue 
should be setded. Several weeks ago, a refer
endum to raise the student activities fee from 
50 to 70 dollars was defeated. Students felt 
that the 40% increase wasexhorbitant. How
ever, as a result of inflation, increased oper
ating expenses, and the formation of
numerous new clubs, there is a need tor 
more money in the Activities Fee.
It is expected that clubs and organizations 
will have to cut their real budgets by 5-10% 
next year. Extra funds will be necessary if 
these cuts do not occur. In order to prevent 
the cuts from happening, more money will 
be necessary.
Tomorrow when voting for your student 
government, you will be presented with an
opportunity to vote in an informal referen
dum asking for a 10 dollar increase (per year) 
in the Activities fee. The additional funds 
will enable funding to continue at the pres
ent levels and to cover the costs of new 
organizations forming on campus.
Please vote tomorrow, both for the sena I 
torial and presidential candidates of y0lJj 
choice and for the informed referendum so 
that present funding levels may continue

Student annouces candidacy
Editor.
I would like to inform the members of 
CIT that I am running as a write-in candi
date for a CIT seat on Student Senate. There 
was a mix-up with my petition, thus I could 
not appear on the ballot sheet.
I am presendy a member of SDC, so I am 
familiar with many of the universitys poli
cies and activities. I have spoken to a few of 
the current senators and am very interested 
in becoming a student representative for 
CIT. The Student Senate needs members 
who are innovative and enthusiastic. I feel I 
possess both of these qualities. I am continu
ally participating in both scholastic and
social activits, thus I can represent the views 
of various student interests.
Right now, although the Student Senate 
voices their opinion on many university 
policies, it often doesnt produce results vis
ible to the student body. I would like to see 
the Senate as a more effective representation 
of student view's. I would like to thank those 
students who supported me by signing my 
petition and would very much appreciate 
the support of the other CIT students.
Please vote on Wednesday or Thursday 
and write my name in on the CIT ballot. 
Thank you.

Reflecting on your core class editorial of 
Feb. 15, I begin to see a similarity between 
you and Warren Beatty in Reds. Cries of 
one big union and uniting everyone to a 
common goal were ideas that could not be 
fulfilled. No matter what Warren did, no 
matter where he went, the dream became 
further and further away. And when 
Maureen Stapleton points out that the way 
in which the dream is being implemented is 
taking them further away from it, Warren 
says that its not going to be the way they 
thought it would, but that they were still 
heading towards that dream.
During all this re-convincing, though, 
other things are creeping up behind you, 
waiting to knock you down. Even Diane
Keaton cant turn things around and may 
them well again. I ask you to just looj 
around you and watch whats going on anj 
not just latch onto a good idea that ( 
seemingly cure all, (if we knew what wasl 
good for us).

Shapiro compares El Salvador to Vietnam policy
SERVIRNAP LCEH ForA f
those Reds. Anyone who knows much of 
anything about the history of the Vietna
mese conflict also knows that what the Pres
ident thinks he knows is, to be polite, a total 
crock. But since Reagan apparendy isnt big 
on studying history, or anything else for that 
matter, it hardly comes as a great shock. 
That his advisors share his myopic and con
fused sense of history is equally
unsurprising.
Given that, one might be inclined to ven
ture the guess that what the Reagan boys 
want to avoid is failure of Vietnam. Aware 
of the impossibility of fighting the war for 
its good buddies in El Salvador, the Admin
istration appears committed to doing all it 
can to support the forces of the brutal and 
repressive Right. After all, how can we do 
less as long as the Soviet Union is support
ing the forces the equally brutal and proba
bly equally repressive Left? Naturally, the 
innocent majority of Salvadorians are 
caught in the middle, but thats hardly any
thing new either.
It seems reasonable to suggest that the 
mentality of the Reagan Administration 
with regard to El Salvador is in reality a 
deliberate Vietnam mindset. While others, 
see American involvement in Vietnam as a
lesson in foreign policy formulation, th| 
Administration appears to view it simplya 
a failure of implementation. If that is inf 
the case, the Reagan boys are bent 
improved execution of questionable 
cies, which is hardly an improvement.
While withholding judgment of the < 
product of the Reagan policy-ma 
machinery, the innards of that machin 
are cause for apprehension.

Biology lab gets fermenter
By LAURA GOLOWICH
Tartan Staffxvriier
Last year, the Biology department 
acquired a fermentation facility, which 
faculty members have been using to produce 
large quantities of microorganisms such as 
bacteria, yeast, and molds. The facility, 
which is located in the basement of Mellon 
Institute, is co-directed by Edwin Minkley, 
associate professor of Biological Sciences at 
CMU, and Professor Roger Hendrix of Pitt.
The facility contains two fermenters. The 
smaller 20-liter fermenter enables the experi
menter to grow over 20 grams of an orga
nism weighing only a microgram. For some 
scientists, according to Dr. Minkley, this 
amount is sufficient for their research. Oth
ers may want to grow as much as a kilogram 
f an organism. In this case, they would use 
the larger 250-liter fermenter, or pilot 
ermenter.
In order to promote the best conditions 
or growing an organism like bacteria, 
inkley said, the experimenter must decide 
ow its environment should be controlled, 
irst, he or she must decide what growth 
edium the cells should be grown in. This 
ay be a simple substance such as sugar 
ater, or a more complex medium such as 
ydrolyzed milk protein.
Then, the temperature must be set. Some 
cteria, which are accustomed to soil, grow 
t at a warm temperature of 25C; others, 
uch as E. coli which live in the intestines 
eed to be grown at normal body 
mperature.
Another variable which must be deterined is aeration  some bacteria need oxyen to grow, while others can only grow in 
e absence of oxygen.
A primary function of the pilot fermenter, 
ccording to Minkley, is to determine strucure function relationships. Physical proprties of a material, he noted, are determined 
y its structure. To learn the structure of a 
aterial, the experimenter must generate 
arge quantities of that material.
Many faculty members are interested in 
solating large amounts of proteins; accordNow.. .

ing to Minklkey, proteins do most of the 
work in the cell. One researcher is presendy 
investigating how proteins transport amino 
acids across a cell membrane, and how this 
active transport might change under dif
ferent conditions.
The pilot fermenter can also be used to 
predict the behavior of an organism if it 
were to grow in an even larger 200,000-liter 
fermenter, which i$ used in industry. One 
application involves the amino add Lysine. 
Cereal grains, Minkley said, are deficient in 
Lysine. With a fermentation facility, an 
industry can generate a large amount of bac
teria containing Lysine. The Lysine can 
then be isolated, and added to grain for 
catde.
Minkley noted that he has contacted local 
businesses and has made the fermentation 
facility available for them to use. He added 
that PPG will be using the facility while 
they are conducting genetic engineering 
projects in Mellon Institute.
Presendy, Minkley said, more efficient fer
menters are being developed with the aid of 
Artificial Intelligence. In the fermentation 
facility now, experimenters have to set the 
variables such as the growth medium and 
temperature by trial and error. Scientists do 
not know if they have created the best condi
tions for an organism to grow in, but merely 
a combination that works.
With the use of Artificial Intelligence, in 
contrast, scientists could determine the 
optimal conditions for growing each orga
nism, and thus eliminate waste. While this 
may not be important in scientific research, 
which according to Minkley, doesnt have 
to be cost-efficient, it is crucial in industry 
where competition prevails.

Groups raise money
The Fourth Annual Student Phonathons 
drew to a close on February 27th. 276 student 
volunteers spoke to over 5,600 alumni and 
recorded 1,741 pledges totaling $59, 234.
Approximately 14,000 calls were made in 
the course of the six weeks of phonathons. 
Of the pledges, 1050 were increased or new 
gifts. These increases will help CMU reach 
its goal of $200,000 in new money to qualify 
for a grant of $100,000 for financial aid from 
the Surdna Foundation in New York.
The twenty-four student organizations 
involved in the phonathons competed for 
cash prizes. Two first place prizes of $100 
each and two second place prizes of $50 each 
were awarded to the groups with the highest 
dollar total, and the highest number of
increased gifts.
Student Corporation, with 31 members 
and the National Society of Black Engineers 
with 23 participants placed first and second 
in the dollars amount category. Student 
Corporation also placed first in number of 
increased gifts, and Senior Design show, 
with 49 volunteers placed second.
The money raised for the CMU Fund at 
the 1983 Student Phonathons will help fund 
on-going capital projects at the University. 
Money will be used for projects such as the 
renovation of classroom, laboratories and 
offices in Hammerschlag Hall, financial 
aid, new practice rooms in Fine Arts, the 
automation of Hunt Library and major 
improvements of University facilities.

Nuclear discourse
continued from page 1
Deterrence required credibility of the 
threat and that requires that actual employ
ment plans be made. The debate really isnt 
for or against nuclear war  no one is for 
nuclear war  it is over how best to prepare 
for nuclear employment for thepurposes of 
deterrence so that employment never 
happens.
He suggested that the recent American 
policy shift to threaten Soviet military 
targets rather than population centers is the 
result of reasoning that the Soviet Union 
tends to value political control and military 
control as its highest valued assets.
Next Payne said that structuring the 
threat to provide the most effective deterrent 
involves planning for flexible response 
options including limited nuclear war. He 
stressed that discussing limited nuclear war 
is certainly not an advocacy of limited 
nuclear war but rather a prudent planning 
measure.
He concluded: To achieve the most effecdve deterrent should require a punidve 
threat, one that includes flexible opdons, i.e. 
planning for a nuclear was for the purposes 
of avoiding that very event.
Rathjens began his side of the lecture by 
stating that nuclear weapons are qualita
tively different than any other arms ever 
developed by man because of their incom
parable magnitude and indiscriminant des
tructive nature.
He described four schools of thought held 
by strategists. These consist of the beliefs 
that 1). nuclear weapons can be used in a 
limited way without escalation; 2). limited 
use may be possible and therefore contin
gency planning should be made; 3). limited 
nuclear wars are not possible and that it is a 
mistake to have more weapons than are 
needed for deterrence; 4). it is immoral to 
pose the threat of destruction of society for 
moderate political objectives.
Rathjens pointed out the problems that 
make limited nuclear war scenarios

Student Senate forms special committee
By PAULINE WEN
Tartan Assistant News Editor
In response to a series of complaints, the 
Student Senate has formed a committee to 
investigate Housing policies. Chairman 
Andy Stahl said that the committee will 
look into the housing office and the housing 
judicial system, both on the structural level 
and concerning personnel. The committee, 
formed three weeks ago, is composed of six 
senators, including Stahl and student 
government president Nate Solano.
One of the reasons for the Senate investi
gation was the February 15 Tartan article on 
the drug bust In that article, a friend of the
student concerned was quoted as saying, 
Tony Martin and some other guy came 
back to [the students] room with him. The 
student himself was quoted as saying that 
Dean Walters said informants lived in housing.
Another specific complaint concerned the 
cancelled Donner party and questions of 
what the powers of housing are concerning 
parties. Many have complained that it takes 
litde evidence to convict a student and that a 
personal grievance could easily turn into a 
housing office disciplinary action because of 
the confidentiality rule.
Stahl said that the committee is trying to 
determine the complaints that are reliable
and those that are not. The committee is 
dealing with this through Oscar Mayer, 
Head of Auxiliary Services. After interview
ing more people and getting their state
ments, the committee hope to have 
statistical data on the reliability of the com
plaints at the end of the week.
Stahl said that so far the committee has 
found no cases of deliberate wrongdoing 
and no spy system. However, he said that 
concerning the spy system, the power and 
job of a Resident Assistant is not clear, and 
that Anthony Martin, director of housing, 
has agreed to form a committee, in order to 
continued on page 7
The discussion panel will include 
Richard Cyert, Herbert Simon, and John P, 
Crecine who will present the views of the 
administration and the faculty on this sub
ject. The views of the student body will be 
presented by Peter Levin and Gina Osborn.
The panelists will address particular 
issues such as what say, if any, students have 
on policy, what means are presendy open to 
students to affect university policy making 
and how students can operate more effec
tively in this capacity, and whether students 
have the right to affect policy to the degree 
which they desire.
All students and all faculty and adminis
tration members are invited to attend this 
function and are encouraged to participate 
in a general discussion period which will 
follow the panelists speeches. This 1 
allow interested members of the CMU com
munity the opportunity to express their 
opinions and to ask questions directed 
toward panelists.

%How utilitarian are world nuclear weapons?
continued from page 6
unlik^y- According to Rathjens, in a 
limited Soviet attack on U.S. military instal
lations, millions of Americans would be 
killed. The uncertainties as to what retalia
tion the president might order, and what 
options he may have, are virtually
incalculable.
Moreover, analyses of real life crises sug
gest that four problems commonly arise. 
First initial intelligence assessments are 
almost invariable wrong. Then too, situa
tions such as presidential assassination 
attempts have shown that confusion often 
arises about authority and responsibility of 
officials. In addition problems often arise 
due to failures in communications and failures of personnel to follow orders.
Rathjens spoke of these problems to 
emphasize the uncertainties involved in stra
tegic planning. I submit that you just can 
not run the risk of using these weapons in 
any significant way without the possibility 
of things just getting out of hand.
He believes we should not have a policy of 
first use of nuclear weapons in case of a 
conventional attack on Western Europe 
since he believes that in Western Europe 
escalation into an all-out nuclear war would 
be inevitable after the first use of these wea
pons. In addition he believes that at todays 
levels of nuclear weapons the marginal util
ity of one more atomic war head is zero and 
that a unilateral 50% reduction in the level of
aims would have little effect in deterrence.
During the question and answer period, a 
member of the audience predicted: The 
world is approaching a historic juncture 
wherein the U.S.A. and U.S.S.R. must fight 
it out to redivide the world, using nuclear 
arms, if necessary. Therefore your talk was 
basically irrelevant. Rathjens replied that 
he hopes that the questioner is wrong on
both counts.
The next lecture in the series will take 
place on Thursday, March 17, at 4:30 p.m. 
in the Wherrett Room and is entitled The 
Utility of Military Force. The speakers will 
be Dr. Barry Blechman of the Roosevelt 
Center for American Policy Studies and Dr. 
Joshua Epstein of the Council on Foreign 
Relations.

puters are also becoming popular consumer 
items for the public. Now theres a reason to 
steal them. Consequendy, microcompu
ters are becoming the CBs of the eighties as 
popular items to steal.
At Louisville, Keller says, we didnt have 
any problems with computer thefts three 
years ago. Now its a monthly occurence. 
Campus law enforcement directors across 
the country echo his concerns. Microcom
puters, they say, along with other computer 
ardware such as phone modems and disk 
ves, are slowly becoming hot items for 
thieves.
We have a large number of personal 
omputers on campus, and at this point 
ave already lost two or three over the last 
nou reports Iowa State Security Officer 
vid Stormer. Iowa State has recendy had 
a number of component parts stolen, too.
Theres a developing market for used
microcomputers, theyre readily resalable, 
and very difficult to trace when they are 
stolen, Stormer notes. Theyre easier to 
steal than a typewriter, concurs Illinois 
States Lt. Don Knapp. Theft of microcom
puters, he says, will undoubtably become 
a major crime problem for colleges.
Drexel University security director 
Edward Smith likewise sees an emerging 
pattern with the theft of micros. The more 
you have on campus, the more vulnerable 
they will be, and the more youll have 
stolen.
Drexel hasnt had any serious computer 
theft problems yet, Smith says, but when 
all entering freshmen will be required to 
have a microcomputer this fall, his depart
ment will make every available effort to see 
that theyre secure. Among other things, he 
plans to register the serial number of each 
micro with the FBIs National Crime Infor
mation Center, and have a special logo
etched on every machine.
Campus security directors across the 
country are frantically working to register, 
label, and bolt down thousands of 
microcomputers.
Camegie-Mellon, which will require all 
entering freshmen to have their own micros 
within the next two years, is already plan
ning a massive Operation I.D. program to 
register and identify the machines.
At Iowa State, everyone who has access 
to a computer is briefed on recommended 
security procedures, Stormer says. We 
recommend every computer be secured 
behind locked doors, and physically att
ached to a wall or table.
And at the Illinios Institute of Technol
ogy, where the campus computer center is 
open around-the-clock, every terminal is 
anchored down and the entire facility moni
tored through a closed-circuit tv system.
senate investigation a witchhunt, and 
accused senate of being out to get him. Stahl 
said that he wishes Martin was more coop
erative. .. It would make things a lot easier, 
he explained.
Martin stressed that housing policies are 
dear, and that it is a question of applying 
University policies in a fair and equitable 
manner. He also said that the Resident 
Hall Handbook had been put together to 
clarify housing policies and that the only 
actions housing takes are oudined in the 
handbook. The scope and methods are 
limited, but I hope clear, said Martin erf the 
housing policies.
Calling the allegations a possible honest 
mistake, Martin denied that he had person
ally gone into the students room. Housing 
was not the office taking action in the case, 
explained Martin.
In response to the statement the housing 
has informants, Martin called the allegation 
wild and spurious. He also said that he 
was disappointed to see [the allegation] in 
the front page story of The Tartan, and 
that he was even more disappointed that 
senate feels it a subject for investigation.
I dont think unhappiness should be the 
cause of a senate investigation, concluded 
Martin.

urvey of CMU questions awareness of defense issues
5y CLARKE V. SIMMONS
\artan Staffwriter
This is the first of three articles based on a 
urvey of CMU students. The survey of 103 
tudents, 46 males and 57 females, was 
onducted campus-wide; a cross-section of 
Indents in all five undergraduate colleges 
vas sampled.
The three questions analyzed in this 
article are concerned with how well 
Informed ths student body is in regard to 
jlitical defense issues.
The percentage of students who did not 
iow the name of the Secretary of Defense is' 
iepicted in the upper bar graph. Two facts 
ire apparent: first, a surprisingly large 
Drtion of those surveyed did not know that 
jsper Weinberger is the Secretary oft
fense; second the difference in the male 
rsus female score (48% vs. 68%, 
Respectively) is intriguing.
The results of the second question 
ndicate that the students are apparently 
>etter informed about how much of the 
)udget goes for defense. Apparently is the 
cey word because very few people seemed 
nformed while the rest made guesstimates.
A major misconception was revealed in 
he results of the third question which asked 
iow much of the defense budget goes for 
mclear weapons. People by gross margins 
>verstated the cost and importance of 
trategic forces.
According to Time, the total proposed 
fiscal 1984 budget is 848 billion dollars. Out 
)f the 848 billion, 274.1 billion or 32.3% are 
narked for defense. Time also reports the 
x>rtion of the budget going for nuclear 
leterrence is 9%.
Overall, it would appear the campus is 
lot very well-informed on these politicallefense issues. This lack of awareness may 
>e due to simple apathy or students general 
letachment from the outside world.

ortan Features Editor
An(ly Carnegie has really been hogging 
he limelight lately. There are two names 
ontributing to our schools illustriousness; 
t s time his Institute of Technology allowed 
nother act to share a slice of the schools 
rowing national fame.
Mellon Institute, which celebrated its 
r>th birthday on March 1, was originally an 
^pendent, non-profit research institute 
tfre hitching up with CMU in 1967.
ere the reason for the hyphen in the 
niversity, said Ted Gerwing, Director of 
^ministration and Development at M.I.
The hyphen contributes much more than 
^arch; the building is breathtaking. Over 
scientists are plugging and chugging 
iside the architecturally pioneering
building. Squatting nobly on 5th Avenue, 
the nine story Institute is surrounded by 
sixty-two columns, weighing in at a hefty 
sixty tons each. As you walk into the lobby, 
the fourth floor, you may think you made a 
wrong turn while heading towards the 
museum. The sprawling marble floor, 
walls, and ceiling are a stately introduction 
to the gothicness of the building; if you keep 
walking, youll head into an ivy leaguish 
library adorned by intricate carved paneling, 
a natural wood floor, and flooded by bright 
sunlight warming the soft leather chairs.
Even the elevator doors are brimming 
with history. Constructed of shining 
aluminum, the doors feature alchemical 
symbols. Descending into the depths of the 
building, you leave behind the awing 
architecture to witness the unfolding of the

future. Behind old, neglected, but 
nevertheless, locked doors, fellowships, like 
the one on pollution control for American 
Iron and Steel, are yielding dividends. Once 
an interest is established by a company, a 
worker becomes a part of M.I.s staff and is 
inserted in a specific area.
Polysyllabic projects  ones which CMU 
students usually read about in the papers  
are continuous. Pittsburgh Plate Glass is in 
the process of setting up a genetic 
engineering facility; fields such as polymer 
fiberoptics and laser fiberoptics are being 
explored, to name a couple. In addition, the
aircraft carrier. The program has a 
tremendous capacity; the user, maybe best of 
all, can use good old English.
Dr. James C. Williams, who came to 
CMU eight years ago as a professor of 
metallurgical engineering and now holds 
the office of president of Mellon Institute, is 
excited about ZOG and very positive about 
the potential of the Institute in general. 
ZOG is a really interesting program to me. 
Its an excellent example of how academic 
and research communication can form a
continuum to fit everyones best interest, he
 says. Its a good idea of what we should be 
doing if we were to become an important
key for flexibility.
Gerwing describes the research process as 
mission-oriented. The scientists and 
company find a goal and work towards it. 
The sponsor can discuss flexibility, 
mentioned Gerwing, but you try not to
is in the tri-state area.
Williams cited another hypothesis 
Suppose Mellon were theoretically divide I 
into two divisions  Finance/Administ^ I 
tion and Technical/Research; Willey 
points to the former as being skinned do 
so functionally, were strapped. It couldj 
get any smaller. In November, Willig 
said the Institute reduced its staff by 7 0r 
something which was painful for jJ
 personally. Playing God is not my stronj 
point.
Building a name and a reputation {J 
solid research is slow, but the president! 
admits that although present economij 
conditions are not at all optimal, holdinJ 
your own is not bad. He feels! 
economically, weve had a helluva 
winter. I think were heading into spring I
Move over, Andy.
The library at Mellon Institute is quite plush.
Institute has acquired the latest of the stateof-the-art microscopes  the Scanning 
Electron Microscope. The SEM, according 
to Howard Wagenblast, Head of Materials 
Applications, has a higher magnification 
than the light microscope, has an extremely 
high depth of focus, and can do chemical 
analyses on very small features. In fact, 
according to Wagenblast, they are exploring 
the use of x-rays to analyze kidney stones.
ZOG is a recent sophisiticated program 
to emanate from M.I. It is an innovative 
computer system thats very easy to use and 
currendy making life easier on board the 
USS Carl Vinson, Americas newest nuclear
part of the university.
Apparendy an optimist at heart but a 
realist for practical reasons, Williams 
foresees a future where Mellon will be 
growing and gaining recognition. He feels 
that the Institute has high quality programs 
which can match those in MIT and 
Stanford. What the president would like to 
see is the sense of morale and sense of pride 
to grow a bit. He feels Mellon needs to 
grow a little to provide flexibility to run on 
an even-level basis. When a program stops, 
you lose people and a sense of continuity. 
Seed projects regenerating and spreading to 
other facets of the organization can be the

impose too many constraints so they cant 
get the work done.
A research institute likes to attract 
sponsoring companies; this is accomplished 
with state-of-the-art equipment. Obviously, 
costs can skyrocket, so the decision 
sometimes must be made to allow the 
sponsor to purchase the necessary 
equipment and hope that the companies 
come to Mellon. Gerwing would like to 
increase M.I.s national visibility by going 
to where the business is. Our concentrationThis plaque tells part of the history of?

many hours of evening reviewing sessions. 
Originally scheduled to be completed before

Judges cited student schedules, unfamiliar

why the judging went so far beyond

Members of the newly-formed CMU Bike 
Club are interested in promoting bicycling 
on the CMU campus. The club is open to all 
members of the CMU community, and 
interests range from recreational/sport rid
ing to racing. The club currently has 21 
members, and many more people have 
expressed an interest in joining.
A n pical ride with the club may last from 
5 minutes to all day, and all ability levels 
re represented. Schenley Park is a favorite 
location for club rides, since many routes are 
to be found there that range from one to 
ven miles with plenty of hills to keep 
things challenging.
Many club members are tourists, and 
me are recreational riders or racers, 
embers pay dues each semester, and the 
roceeds from dues will cover the cost of 
iub tools and advertising. Funding from 
tudent Senate has not been granted, but the 
ike Club is under consideration, according
to Pres. Lance Smith. Smith came up with 
the idea of re-instituting CMUs old bike 
club last year.
There were a lot of people around who 
were interested ... I had trouble finding 
places to ride in Pittsburgh, and I thought 
this would be a way for people who knew 
the area to show others places to ride. 
Future plans for the club entail several 
specific events. Campus races or an intramu
ral bike race are under consideration; how
ever, permits are needed to gain 
police-maintained closing of streets in 
Schenley, where the races would most likely 
be held. Other activities, according to Smith, 
are trying to get together with other cycling 
organizations and go for longer rides on 
weekends. Also, people who are interested in 
racing but have no background can learn 
from club members who have experience. 
The club meets every Wednesday at 8:00 
p.m. in Skibo 13, and rides are tentatively 
scheduled for every Thursday at 9:00 a.m. 
For information about the bike club, contact 
Lance Smith at 578-4005.

Brett Runion and Michael Alex, of the Bike Club, riding down Frew Street
forms holding beds were very popular on 
the CMU campus Scott and Ron made 
theirs fade into the woodwork. The room 
actually appeared to be an anteroom and an 
uncluttered living room area dominated by 
a large leather chair and vase of dried flow
ers. Perhaps Donner Hall affords students a 
better basis for room decor than some other 
campus residence halls but there is no doubt 
that the atmosphere in this room is 
undorm.
CMU Honorable Mention: (2nd place)
Marcus Lovett, drama freshman, and Jim 
Gray, a design freshman, took a relatively 
concrete room in Hammerschlag A, 
doused it with colorful artifacts and added 
rug along the walls between their posters 
and wallhangings to create a very musically 
sound environment, as well as a homey 
one.

Morris Hausen and Dave Sitner, working 
with their room at the Delta Tau Delta

Navy Officers Gel Responsibility Fast.
In most jobs, at 22 
youre near the bottom 
of the ladder.
In the Navy, at 
22 you can be a leader.
After just 16 weeks 
of leadership training, 
youre an officer. Youll 
have the kind of job 
your education and training prepared 
you for, and the decision-making au
thority you need to make the most of it.
As a college graduate and officer 
candidate, your Navy training is geared 
to making you a leader. There is no boot 
camp. Instead, you receive professional 
training to help you build the technical 
and management skills youll need as a 
Navy officer.
This training is 
designed to instill 
confidence by first
hand experience. You 
learn by doing. On 
your first sea tour, 
youre responsible for 
managing the work of 
up to 30 men and the
care of sophisticated 
equipment worth 
millions of dollars.
Its a bigger chal
lenge and a lot more 
responsibility than 
most corporations give 
you at 22. The rewards 
are bigger, too. Theres 
a comprehensive package of benefits, 
including special duty pay. The starting 
salary is $17,000more than most com
panies would pay you right out of college. 
After four years, with regular promo
tions and pay increases, your salary will 
have increased to as much as $31,000.
As a Navy officer, you grow, through 
new challenges, new tests of your skills,
and new opportunities 
to advance your edu
cation, including the 
possibility of attending 
graduate school while 
youre in the Navy.
Dont just take a 
job. Become a Navy 
officer, and take charge. 
Even at 22.

like engineering majors, rebelling against 
the humans who created them and keep 
them in a servile state. These robots organize

ning to destroy mankind and take over the 
world.
This familiar Saturday morning sci-fi sce
nario was wrapped around a soapy love 
story involving Domain, the head of 
R.U.R., and Helena Glory, an investigator 
of sorts from the Human League.
And unfortunately it remained sudsy 
when acted by Davidson Thompson and 
Maureen Quigley. These two never got 
beyond the klutzy dialogue, and Miss Qui
gley, an especially talented actress, was quite 
simply miscast as Helena. She started well 
but she just did not have the requisite 
aplomb of a 1940s movie starlet to carry her 
through a role like this.
Mr. Lehane seems to have coached the 
actors to disregard believability and instead 
maintain a farcical pace at all cost. And 
although the comedy of the piece was well 
fleshed out, the acting suffered for it.
The only two performances really worth
while among the large cast were those of 
Brian Varga and Maxine Lapiduss. Mr. 
Varga was marvelous as Dr. Fabry. Unlike 
the four other actors who play the inevitable 
mad scientists, with Mr. Vargas perfor
mance, one slowly realized the comedy at the 
surface was matched by a palpable madness 
underneath. A smart acting job.
The best bit of acting came, as usual, from 
Maxine Lapiduss. Her talent has been so 
often maligned in smallish character roles I 
was distressed to see her cast in yet another. 
But as Emma, Helenas all-too-human 
maid, Miss Lapiduss was so simple and 
direct and funny that the whole elaborately 
conceived production seemed for a moment 
beside the point.
I believe it was important that a warning 
about our campuses burgeoning technol
ogy came from a potent source like the thea

The show is essentially the directors. The

1 VINCENT GUINTO
I rtan Contributing Editor 
LTie Point Park College Student ComJnys presentation of William Gibsons 
e Miracle Worker, although reasonably 
ultimately comes across as just 
another rehashing of the same 
old thing. The Helen Keller 
story has been told so many 
times on stage and television
that most people have seen it already, and 
this production has litde new to offer.
The main twist to the show seems to be 
the attention paid to making it enjoyable to 
the visually handicapped. A new feature is 
the availability of braille action scores, 
which provide written descriptions of the 
sets, the actors appearances, and the key 
action scenes. This production is billed as
fen Keller learns to accept human guidance in The Miracle Worker at Point Park s
.  . - ..... .... jf.-; .  il. 1,
the first in live theater to offer these scores.
Also available before the show are tape 
recordings of the actors voices and the text 
of the braille scores, and there is a touring 
thirty-minute workshop which includes 
both the scores and the recordings, as well as 
familiarization with actual props and meet
ing with cast members. This emphasis on 
aiding the blind isapparendy a new innova
tion in theater, and certainly something that 
has been needed for a long time.
The show itself is competently done. Of 
the cast, Heidi Devoe (Annie Sullivan) and 
Betty Dell (Helen Keller) both deserve credit 
for filling two difficult and physically 
demanding roles. In particular, their 
almost-classic dining room confrontation 
was quite well acted, with Dell putting on a 
wonderful spoiled-child act. throughout the 
play, Dell carried her especially difficult role 
with great discipline.
The rest of the cast also performed well. 
Mary Chess did a convincing job as Helens 
gende, loving, and overindulgent mother. 
Eulalar Campbell (Viney the maid) added a 
welcome bit of comic relief to her scenes. 
Scott Norton (Helens half-brother) came 
across excellently in his scenes as a cocky 
young man alone with Devoe; unfortu
nately, his scenes opposite his father (John 
Gresh) did not work as well.
The shows sets were elaborately con
structed, with obviously great attention 
given to detail. The open, multi-level effect 
used to stage the Keller house and yard was 
quite effective. Unfortunately, there were 
some rough spots in the staging; the garden 
house set especially seemed to get in the way 
as actors attempted to move from place to 
place. The lighting was excellendy done, 
accenting Annies childhood flashbacks and 
shifting attention from place to place on 
stage very well.
The directing by Jill Wadsworth was 
decent, but left a litde to be desired. In 
Greshs case particularly there was a prob
lem; he almost never looked directly at the 
other actors in his scenes, but instead gazed 
out at the audience or at the ground. While 
to a certain extent this was characteristic of 
his role, it was inappropriate in several 
scenes (especially when having a supposedly 
intimate conversation with Chess).
Still, considering that The Miracle 
Worker is a college production, tbe show 
was well done. While most adults will 
remember having seen the story told else
where, the show is still a treat, especially for 
children and those who have managed not 
to have seen it before.
The play is showing at the Pittsburgh 
Playhouse Theatre Center in Oakland, and 
will run through March 13. ,

Forbes Gallery artists focus on individuals
By SARAH G. RATCHYE
Tartan Staffwriter
This weeks show at Forbes Gallery 
emphasizes the history and personality of 
the individual within society. The three 
artists, Gayle Mahn, Jennifer Manley, and 
Riri Nakasone are concerned 
with specific experiences and 
individuals. In her portraits, 
Jennifer Manley combines her 
soft, hatched lines and quiet eye to create a 
subde reflection of her sitters personality. 
This union of form and intent is evident 
also in her pen and pencil drawings of older 
persons. Manley is also exhibiting several 
drawings of buckeyes. The sensuously 
smooth buckeye and its forbidding, spiked 
shell are the artists symbol for the human

Lifes tough in the suburbs. Many 
plays have been written on this theme. Alms 
for the Middle Classy new play by Stuart 
Hample premiering at the Pittsburgh Pub-/
lic Theatre, is one. But to reduce 
the play to this banality does a 
disservice to a fine piece of 
drama.
The story deals with the fallout from the 
explosion of a nuclear family. While attend
ing the Country School, a laid-back prep 
school, 16-year-old Ken Gaines (Marcus 
Diamond) appears to go off the deep end. 
He sets up a wigwam in the woods, begins 
calling himself Tender Coyote, and stops 
talking to people. All that his friends can 
gather is that his father is the problem. With 
the help of his counselor, Keith (Timothy 
Donoghue), Ken tries to bring his father 
Marshall (Richard Greene) up to the school 
to draft a new contract.
From this beginning, the play traces 
Kens attempts to reach his father, flashes 
back to scenes of the parents messy marriage 
and even messier divorce, and leads to a 
climactir face-off between father and son.
personality. However, I do not find Man
leys portraits to be as prohibitive as the 
buckeyes shell.
The repressed and nefarious aspects of 
human personality seem to have surfaced in 
Gayle Mahns drawings. Her figures anat
omy has been grotesquely rearranged. Pro
truding bones and body parts melt into the 
deep space surrounding the figures. Often a 
figures head has been cropped. The bodies 
with heads are, like the others, mute and 
disfigured reminders of some horrible event 
or circumstance.
Included in the group of drawings are 
some relatively unaltered, realistic selfportraits by Mahn. The artists most power
ful self-portraits are painted, however. 
Using black and white enamel, charcoal,

Given that plot synopsis, it may come as a 
surprise that Alms for the Middle Class is a 
very funny play. But in fact, the PPT Com

Marshall Gaines, has pulled off an impres
sive feat. WTien the tension is running high
est, Greene can snap out a one-liner that has 
the audience roaring  and not detract from 
the drama at all. Greene, as the zany, 
snappy, and bitter Marshall, has set a high 
goal for his successors to match.
Also noteworthy was the PPT set. Strik
ingly designed by Thomas Walsh, the set 
contains moveable units representing a very 
realistic office, a plush living room, and the 
meeting room at the Country School. The 
small cast, including Evalyn Baron as Doris 
Gaines, and Bethany Faye DeCof as Kens 
friend Sarah, fill this set, if not with rapid 
motion, with rapid-fire dialogue which 
crackles through the small theatre, and fixes 
the audience in their seats. I dont know 
where Alms will go from PPT, but it 
deserves to go far.
and acrylic paint and a more symbolic, for
mal attitude, Mahn has captured the same 
frightening atmosphere expressed in her 
drawings of figures. A thin line divides the 
artist in half in one painting, suggesting 
indecision and conflict. In another paint
ing, a continuous line describes the artist 
within an expanse of white paint. The 
small, dark square within the white con
tains a sketchily painted hand. Perhaps the 
artist is glorifying the artists means of 
expression or contrasting a self-portrait with 
an artists hand-portait. I was most 
intrigued by Mahns red, black, and white 
self-portrait. The figures crossed arms and 
hunched shoulders create the impression of 
an African fetish figure. Straight pins have 
been painted into the picture supporting my 
idea of a fetish, but also suggesting self
torment.
A clear essential symbolism and creative 
understanding of form and materials com
bine to make Mahns self-portraits powerful 
and evocative works.
Riri Nakasones prints, drawings, and 
sculptures were created out of the artists 
memories of her Japanese home and exten
sive research on Japanese and European
printing. Seen as a group, the relief prints

For eighteen years, Carnegie-Mellon Uni

designed to give high school students an 
opportunity to develop educationally and 
to discover if they have the necessary 
aptitudes/talents for further study. The

with the Division of Student Affairs and a 
staff of resident counselors, will coordinate

such metal monsters as Saxxon, Girlschool, 
and (at times) AC/DC.
One of the bands great early flaws, the 
overrunning of the vocals by the 
instruments, was at least partially overcome 
in this new release. In Battle Cry, a 
thoughtful anti-war statement, we hear the 
strong, resonant voice of Gil Moore that has 
been hidden beneath his drums for so many 
years. And while Rils Emmett does not have 
Moores range, he proves in the title track he 
can hold high tones with power and 
precision.
Emmett contributes the balance of the 
albums instrumentals. One of todays top 
guitarists (though he receives little 
recognition) he has added slide guitar and 
steel guitar pedals to his repertoire. In Too' 
Much Thinking, he uses steel pedals to 
create a sound new to the band and a strong,
novel solo. When the Lights Go Down, a 
very heavy and appealing song, features a 
rock n roll-ish slide guitar lead-in and a 
versatile solo.
The most outstanding guitar pieces are 
A Minor Prelude and All the Way. A 
Minor Prelude, like Petit Etude on 
Armed Forces shows Emmetts classical 
abilities in an accoustic solo. The solo in 
All the Way shows his ability to create 
appropriate ad libs. Also interesting is 
Epilogue, in which he plays lead to his 
own double-tracked rhythm. These songs 
are impressive not only because of their 
quality, but because many bands do not 
have the talent to produce something 
similar.

Special TV Review
The M*A*S*H crew waves goodbye as viewers salut
By JOE GUARINO
Special for the Tartan
Goodbye, Farewell, and Amen. 
M*A*S*H has ended. And it did so in a 
Grande Finale Monday, February 28, 1983, 
eleven seasons after its debut September 17,
* 1972. An era, 251 episodes, 104
^ TV hours long, has come and
JT gone.
The final episode of 
M*A*S*H once again showed the doctors, 
nurses, and corpmens escapes from the 
Korean War. Just as the war released them 
from military service back to the U.S.A., so 
too were they released from their escapes to 
realize the impact and harsh realities of the 
war.
Sarcastic, almost cynical humor, 
drinking, and military mockery were some 
of the escapes for Captain Benjamin 
Franklin Hawkeye Pierce (Alan Alda). 
Through his avenues of escape, Hawkeye 
tried often to avoid the fact that he was 
constantly patching these kids up ... and 
sending them right back up there to the line 
... Although he occasionally faced this 
reality, the more he faced it the more he 
built up resistance to death, the worst and 
most hated cost of war.
The last episode starts in a mental 
hospital (quite puzzling since few  if any
 episodes began someplace other than the 
unit) and we hear Hawkeye answering the 
familiar voice of psychologist Dr. Sydney 
Freedman (Alan Arbus) and realize Pierce
has had a nervous breakdown.
It seems that the story began during an 
evening bus ride home from an outing, 
when the bus had to stop and pull off the 
road into some brush. All had to keep silent 
while waiting for enemy troops to pass by. 
After several talks with Sydney, Hawkeye 
realizes he tried so hard to avoid personal 
death that he caused a village mother to 
smother her own crying babe. Once the war 
ends he is able to look back at the impact of 
that incident and realize that joking around 
and drinking in The Swamp werent good 
enough escapes from the inevitable  
death.
A family back home was Captain B.J. 
Hunnicuts (Mike Farrell) escape. During 
the show, he receives orders that he is to go 
home. Though the C.O. hasnt received any 
information from I COR saying otherwise,
B.J. enlists the support of everyone in the 
mess tent to encourage his C.O. not to 
deprive him of the chance to see his 
daughter on her second birthday only a few 
days away.
Of course, his chances are ruined when he 
can only make it half-way home (his orders 
are recinded), and hes shipped right back to 
the 4077th. An excellent opportunity to have 
his escape from the war become reality is 
confounded by the complexities of the war 
itself.
Get me out erf here! ... I need to get 
back to the civilized world... Degraded and 
frustrated by the cesspool in which he lives,
Major Charles Emerson Winchester III 
(David Ogden Stiers) will do anything to 
bring culture into the 4077th. Music, Mozart 
in particular, is his escape to culture. While 
returning to the unit from the woods one 
day, five enemy soldiers run Winchester 
down, surrender to him, and begin to play 
music for him. Although the music is 
unbearably horrendous at first, Winchester 
desperately attempts to coordinate these 
musicians in some semblance of an 
orchestra. Though they never quite reach 
his strata of excellence, he has to reluctantly 
bid the POWs adieu. When one returns 
shot up, the others didnt make it, 
Winchester then realizes that the music he 
once turned to for tranquility and a sense of 
culture would now become his constant 
reminder of the traumas of war. With that, 
he proceeds to listen to his priceless 
recording of Mozart one last time before 
smashing it to pieces.
When he rode his horse, Sophie, Colonel 
Sherman Potter (Harry Morgan) could 
escape to simpler years with his wife, 
Mildred, back home on the range. Three 
wars over 30 years have interrupted his 
marriage. At the wars end, he must leave his 
one love, Sophie, in a local village to go 
home to his other love, Mildred, and her 
long list of household chores.

gs will be quite different for CMUs 
s varsity sports next year. This is 
se the conference that they play in, 
dents Athletic Conference (PAC), has 
under a massive shake up.
o members of the eight team confer| Allegheny and Case Western Reserve, 
elected to leave the PAC in order to 
a new conference. The new league 
the Ohio Athletic Conference and
will consist of Allegheny, Case, Denison, 
Kenyon, Oberlin, Ohio Weslyan, and Woos
ter College.
The main reason for the switch to this 
new conference is for the improvement of 
the womens programs at both Allegheny 
and Case. The PAC never had had any div
isions for the women. The CMU girls com
pete in the Pennwood West conference, 
totally unrelated to the PAC.
The main effect this has on the CMU 
sports progran is that since the PAC is down
to 6 teams, Thiel, Hiram, W&J, Bethany, 
John Carrol, and CMU, the conference 
might lose its automatic bid to the NCAA 
Division III basketball playoffs. Therefore, 
the Athletic Directors of the PAC are look
ing for two new teams. Candidates for these 
open spots are possibly Mt. Union, West
minster, Geneva, Grove City, and Mercyhurst. Mt. Union and Grove City seem the 
most plausible since all of their teams com
pete on a Division III level.
There also has been a rumor that the new
conference contacted CMU for the possibil
ity that the Tartans would, too, shift to the 
Ohio League. James Banner, Athletic Direc
tor at CMU, confirmed that rumor but 
stated that CMU declined the offer. We felt 
that the amount of time the students would 
be away from the campus would hurt their 
academic and social life. Before making the 
decision to not move into this new league, 
the administration had a meeting with all of 
the team captains in order to get their view 
on the subject.:'s playoff time for CMU hockey squad

ie Tartan Ice Hockey Team was very 
for the last three weeks as the regular 
|>n came to a dose. After knocking off 
iesne 6-0 on Wednesday, February 16, 
1 artans played four games in eight days, 
split the four games to give them a 
mark of 18-3 with one game
four game stretch began on Saturday, 
ry 19, when the Tartans visited 
rY Rock in Meadville for a 4:30 p.m. 
Centerman Andy Andrejko and his 
*tes Caleb Corkery and Bill Heyse promost of the offense in a 7-1 league 
KV- Andrejko picked up a hat trick, getjhis final goal with only nine seconds 
Mmng in the game. Donny Heyse scored 
goals, and Rick Samuelsen and Mike 
10 had one a piece to complete the 
lng[ter a late night in Meadville, the Tarjhosted West Chester State College at
a.m. the next day in an exhibition 
[h The weary Tartans were not up for 
ime and mustered only 14 shots on 
en route to a 3-2 loss. West Chester 
a J-l tie with two goals early in the 
Penod. Bill Heyse cut the lead to one at
14:03, but the Tartans could not get the 
equalizer in the final minute. The loss 
stopped CMUs winning streak at eight 
games.
The Tartans regrouped to stop the Uni
versity of Pittsburgh, 3-1, at the Lakevue Ice 
Palace on Wednesday, February 23. Rick 
Samuelsen scored twice to get CMU back on 
the winning track.
But the winning streak ended at one game 
as the Division I Dayton Flyers came to 
Pittsburgh on Saturday the 26th and 
thumped the Tartans 6-4. The Flyers, who 
play the likes of Purdue and the University 
of Indiana in their conference, used the big 
ice surface at the Civic Arena to spread the 
Tartans out on defense and scored their six 
goals on just 25 shots. The Tartans played 
Dayton even through the first period, but a 
penalty-plagued second period hurt CMU 
as Dayton netted five goals to take a 6-2 lead 
after two periods. The Tartans mounted a 
comeback in the third period on the strength 
of two Chris Byrne scores, but could not pull 
any closer.
The Tartans completed their regular sea
son schedule Sunday afternoon with a game 
against Indiana (Pa.) University at 
Kittanning.
The league playoffs begin tonight with 
Duquesne playing Penn State-McKeesport. 
The winner of this game will face CMU in 
the Southern Division cahmpionship
match on Wednesday. The Southern cham
pion faces the Northern champion on the 
Northern teams home ice on Saturday, 
March 12.

Women hoopsters end season on a high note
By DOUG REINSTEIN
Tartan Staffwriter
In the season finale, the lady Tartans led 
by sophomores Laurie Arenda, and 
Michelle Schegel, as well as senior captain 
Deborah Durr, topped Seton Hill 53-51 last 
Friday.
In a game that see-sawed back and forth, 
the Tartans didnt put it away until 0:24 left 
in the game. Both teams came out in zone 
defenses, with CMU in a 1-3-1 and Seton 
Hill in a 2-1-2. The Tartans jumped out to 
an early 8-5 lead. Seton Hill fought back to 
tie it up at 10 with 11 minutes remaining in
the half. Consecutive baskets by junior 
Winner Law increased the Tartan lead to 
14-10. Tartans Durr and Schlegel traded 
baskets as the lead was increased to six, 22- 
16. The half ended with Tartans supporting 
a 26-21 lead.
The Tartans came out quickly in the 
second half and they scored the first three, 
and led 29-21. Then it was Seton Hills turn 
to show their offensive ability.
Led by freshman Lisa Schlosser and 
sophomore Carol Gelet, they scored ten 
unanswered points and took the lead 31-29. 
Schlosser hit three consecutive jumpers
from the perimeter. After a Tartan timeout, 
it was CMUs turn to take over. The Tartans 
put on an 11-4 scoring surge erf their own. 
Laurie Arendas connec ted on 3 jumpers and 
Durr scored twice down low as the Tartans 
went on top 40-33 with 7:32 remaining.
With about five minutes remaining, 
Seton Hill went into a man to man full 
count press. Arendas and junior guard 
Nancy Bums handled the pressure easily. 
Arendes, Schlegel, and Durr connected to 
keep the Tartan lead at seven, 48-41, with 
2:52 remaining. Seton Hill closed the gap to 
50-45 with 1:09 remaining.
Seton Hills pressure finally paid 
they forced the Tartans into succes 
turnovers. These turnovers were conwj 
into Schlosser baskets and quickly it 
one point game.
The Tartans came down the 
needing a basket badly. They moved the 
around the perimeter. After a coup 
passes, the ball went to the low posttoD 
She powered up and converted the 
bank shot with only 24 seconds remain 
Schlegels free throw gave the Tartansa 
point edge. A basket at the buzzer m 
enough, as Seton Hill fell short by 
points.

In Newport, RI, The American Sail 
Ining Association, a non-profit organin> is offering eight sail training cruises 
ing the summer of 1983; they are open to 
lents between the ages of 15 and 26.
cruises are unusual in that they 
5lve deep-water sailing in square-rigged 
L or large schooners, and are working 
jitions with trainees organized in 
teams to serve in four-hour, roundlock, shifts.
limbing the rigging (optional), a trick at 
[wheel, galley and cleaning duties, and 
handling are all part of the days work, 
iddition to being an integral part of the 
fk aboard ship, participating trainees 
have many memorable experiences - 
spectacular sunsets to group discus
es to efforts at celestial navigation. All 
find that the demands of wind and sea 
into acdon strengths previously 
lown to them - and build an espirit de 
\jS and an enthusiasm which are unique.
ASTA counselor will be aboard each 
|ise to supervise training, and the ships 
)tain and crew will participate in the 
ruction; but trainees are encouraged to 
every responsibility they can-this is a 
Ince to dare. No previous sailing is neces}, although applicants must be able to 
[m. For trainees with adeqiiate back|und, a personal qualification program 
ling to designation as deckhand or ablelied seaman will be undertaken.
lis year, six of the cruises are concen|ed in the New England area: one aboard 
X OF RIGHTS (151 Topsail 
[ooner), one aboard BRILLIANT (Mys| Seaports 61 Schooner), two aboard 
)VIDENCE (110' replica of the RevoluWar Topsail Sloop), and two 
ard RACHEL AND EBENEZER (102 
Ipsail Schooner). One cruise takes place in
Puget Sound on ADVENTURESS (101 
Schooner), and another on Lake Superior 
aboard SHEILA YEATES (66 Gaff-Rigged 
Ketch). All cruises are about one week in 
length, usually starting and returning to the 
same port, with only normal rough clothes 
required. PROVIDENCE and BILL OF 
RIGHTS will participate in ASTAs local 
race series from July 3rd to the 9th. This will 
give trainees the added adventure of compet
itive sailing and social activities with trai
nees from other ships.
Cost of a one-week cruise ranges from 
$275 to $425. This includes bunk, food, and 
training - the only extra would be what a
"Graphite on Paper" shows
trainee wishes to spend ashore. Groups of 
six or more get a ten percent discount. There 
are limited scholarship funds available 
where need and interest are demonstrated 
through confidential references.
A further opportunity involves two sail 
training programs of international scope. 
The STA Schooners (each 150+ in length) 
are offering a limited number of berths for 
two week periods to people from this side of 
the Atlantic. This is an aggressive sail train
ing program, expertly run, which will be a 
great opportunity to meet British cousins in 
an exciting atmosphere.
Also, the Norwegian Tall Ship SORLANDET (216 long) will cruise from Ber
muda to Quebec (with a stop at Boston); 
through the Great Lakes (with stops at Chi
cago, Duluth, and Thunder Bay); and from 
Halifax to Bermuda (stopping in Newport). 
This is the only full-rigged ship offering sail 
training to the general public in the Western 
Hemisphere this summer, and her course 
should take her through some spectacular 
countryside.
Those interested in these once-in-alifetime opportunities should write 
SUMMER SAIL, ASTA, Fort Adams State 
Park, Newport, RI 02840, or phone 401-846- 
0884.
Lack of pictures but not art at Pittsburgh Plan
By CAROLYN TERNER
Tartan Staffwriter
It seems that what artists do best is draw 
pictures.. Right? Wrong. In the case of 
Kathleen Montgomery, now showing her 
work, Graphite on Paper, at the Pittsburgh 
Plan for Art through March 13, 
there is not a picture to be found.
Ar What is to be found is an 
inventive artist concerned with 
objective, conceptual art.
As one walks into the main gallery space, 
one is confronted by a long, rectangular 
sheet of paper coated with a black, metalliclooking substance (graphite and oil crayon) 
draped over three wooden bars. The idea is 
form, not content.
Three other imposing pieces can ben seen 
from this vantage point: a large, twodimensional wall hanging consisting of red 
and blue oil crayon on black graphite, with 
a subtle indication of red on the top; more
shiny black paper curving to form an 
elongated infinity symbol; and a black 
square bending in space coming out from 
the wall, falling gracefully over the gallery 
stand. These pieces pierce the space, and 
fracture the imagination.
In the middle of the adjoining room there 
is a white platform; on it rests more shinyblack paper, divided diagonally in half into 
red and blue triangles; and between the 
platform and the paper juts a cylindrical 
metal tube. This piece literally takes 
command of the floor space; it reminds one 
of Rothko in its sublimity and mystical 
qualities.
A piece that is highly conceptual in 
nature is twelve pieces of paper, each with a 
black stripe slanting at a different angle. It is 
this subde variation on a theme that makes 
an art rich in imagination, although one 
gets the sense that they have seen it before, 
perhaps in the art of Joseph Albers, Frank 
Stella, or even Nam Jun Paik (in his
retrospective at the Whitney, he used 
television screens with neon-like lines in a 
similar arrangement).
There are ten framed works that deal with 
black squares and lines, and planes bending 
in space. Each is different-one could say 
that the artist has a strong affinity for 
geometry than traditional drawing. But the 
artist brings us back, or forward, into a 
realm that combines a traditional twodimensional medium with 3-dimensional 
space. Illusionism is dead.
Kathleen Montgomery typifies a unique 
artist who has found truth in her own vision 
amidst trends of expressionism and 
contemporary figuration. It is exceptional 
to see an artist who comes up with fresh 
ideas in relation to the recent modernist 
tradition.
The Pittsburgh Plan for Art is located at 
407 S. Craig St. Gallery hours are Tues.-Sat. 
10-5, and Sun. 1-5.

Nate Solano
Question 1
a.) The most serious problem facing 
MU students this year is the same that 
lCed them last year, the year before, and will 
mtinue to plague them into the future: the 
igh cost of tuition. While our country 
ggles to control inflation and deficits at 
ie expense of programs such as student aid, 
ition continues to skyrocket. Nineteen 
rcent this year, 12% approximated for next 
r. Sorry, frieftds in Warner Hall, I cannot 
terpret loans offered at 12% interest rates 
ficient dedication to insuring the comple>n of studies by students. As you may 
member, last year I admitted that I could 
obably have no effect on this situation. I 
ve at best made the administration take 
temporary student reaction into account 
their tuition determination process. I will 
tinue to do my best in this area.
Question 2
Once again I promise those programs, 
projects, etc. which I believe that YOU (the 
udents) want:
1.) Rat Hunt  During Spring
Carnival students will be given 
the opportunity to hunt CMU 
rats (no off-campus rats will be 
accepted; verification will be 
done through analysis of what 
the rats have eaten). A free food 
contract will be offered the per
son bringing in the largest rat. 
(This will be determined strictly 
by weight. NO LONG 
SKINNY RATS)
2. Intramural ROLLER BALL
 A high-tech, corporateinspired sport for a high-tech, 
corporate-inspired school.
3. "Doc Johnsons" franchise for 
the book store  monogrammed with CMU logo.
4. Replace Mel Shapiro with 
Mr. T.
5. Chainsaw the Fence Event for 
Spring Carnival  Winner 
meets Wendy O. Williams
6. Sue Computer Tech for Uni
versity patent violations.
7. Keep Student Senate open to 
student opinion.
8. Any other good ideas.
Question 3
I basically intend to continue in these rela
tionships via the same methods I have insti
tuted this year. Specifically, being available 
in the Senate Office at almost all times possi
ble (historically Presidents have not held 
serious office hours), continuing with my 
Tartan column, and staying in contact with 
WRCT (talk shows have not proven feasible
this year, however WRCT continues to 
make me promises). I have considered this 
one of my strongest areas of development. At 
least some people know who I am.
Question 4
Strengths  A growing willingness to 
question that which was previously blindly 
accepted (i.e. University Policy). With this 
has come more liberal ideology and an 
continued on page S-4
would be last semesters finals schedule, 
which began on Saturday  notices guaran
teeing that this would not happen were still 
posted outside some departmental offices 
even as students were scheduled for the 
exams. Another example is the change of 
drop date to coincide with the add date. Very 
few students appear to have been aware of 
this change this semester.
I feel that if there were better communica
tion between the administration and the stu
dent body perhaps more of us would get 
motivated and be more on top of things. If 
the students had known about these changes 
when first proposed, instead of after they 
were put into effect, the administration 
would have been able to obtain and respond 
to feedback from the students.
Another problem is that of housing. For 
the three years that I have been at CMU, not 
only has the tuition increased massively, but 
so has the cost of on-campus housing. Some 
of this is probably due to inflation, but 
something has to be said about the price 
after considering this. For example, many of 
the apartments in Doherty are for four stu
dents. They have two rooms, a bathroom, 
and a tiny kitchen attached to the main 
room. The price for next year will be $1,900 
per student. Doesnt sound too bad, some 
might say, but multiply this by four, and 
you are paying $7,600 for a two-room apart
ment for one year. This works out to over 
$600/month for the year, despite the fact 
that we only use the apartment for 8 months 
(if you average it over 8 months, the price 
comes out to $950/month). I have trouble 
understanding this, considering the quality
of the rooms.
Question 2
1. Extend the hours of the gym, specifi
cally the pool. The pool is often toocrowded 
for comfortable swimming, and the hours 
are often insufficient. In addition, it would 
be really nice at times to be able to take a 
quick swim after a late-night gym workout.
2. Have one dining facility be open all 
night. There are many students who work 
late hours finishing projects, homework, 
programs, etc. with no place to eat after 12 
AM.
3. In general, improve communication 
specifically by:
 Getting a writer to cover the 
Senate meetings every Tuesday, 
and report to the Tartan
 Getting someone to report to 
WRCT
 Installing bulletin boards in 
dorms and academic buildings
 Informing RAs by holding 
meetings or forwarding flyers to 
their residence
Another nice addition might be a 
monthly calendar, perhaps published in the 
Tartan, showing all deadlines and possible 
policy changes.
Question 3
Much of this is answered under Question
2  through the Tartan, WRCT, RAs, bul
letin boards, and especially through the 
senators themselves.
Question 4
In general, taking myself as an example, 
continued on page S-4
Nina Thanjan
Question 1
Wo problems which go hand in hand
1  The lack of information 
available to students.
2. The lack of student 
involvement.
These two issues are closely related and 
augment each other. Many changes are 
made by the administration, and the general 
student body is only made aware of these 
after implementation. An example of this

Steve Weller 
CIT
Having attended most of the Student 
Senate meedngs this semester, I can see why 
many students feel that Senate simply 
squabbles and doesnt do anything. Student 
Senate, contrary to Popular belief, does do 
many things to help CMU students. How
ever, I believe Senate can do a great deal 
more, and I plan to be a catalyst in produc
ing a more responsible and involved Stu
dent Senate. A Senate which informs 
students how their activities fee is spent. 
Your decision decides the type of Student 
Senate CMU will have. Vote Wednesday or 
Thursday for Steve Weller.
Alexandra Kavoulakis 
CIT
I am running for re-election to the Stu
dent Senate for two major reasons. The first 
is to assure that Senate works efficiendy in 
order to accomplish the things that students 
want. During this past year, I have been the 
Chairman of Senate. In that position, I have 
worked to quickly resolve any disputes 
within Senate or with other organizations. I 
have also tried to keep Senate moving on 
important issues, such as adding a second 
reading day before finals, and to prevent 
much of the confusion that has occurred in 
the past.
The second reason I want to be re-elected 
is to assure that CIT students opinions are 
represented effectively. Throughout my 
three years at CMU, I have made a strong 
effort to meet many people from all depart
ments and classes. By discussing the major 
issues brought before Senate with a large 
variety of these people,*! have been able to 
get a representative opinion. If CIT students 
re-elect me, I will continue to voice their 
opinions and work to make Senate more 
effective for everyone.

A student senator acts as a mediator: one 
who is sensitive to the needs of the students 
and administration, one who can serve asa 
bridge between the two to improvt 
communication.
Double-majoring in phychologv and pro 
fessional writing, working as features editoi 
of The Tartan, and acting as co-captain d 
the womens tennis team, I have been 
exposed to many diverse workings of the 
university. '
In three years here, I have become suffi 
ciently integrated to be able to attend to the 
needs of the students and to present then 
opinions to the administration. Together, 
we can effect changes; communication cat 
and must be improved. Id like to get thebal 
rolling. * i I
Rebecca Sikora 
CIT
CMU is a dynamic community, one in 
constant motion and undergoing constant 
change. These activities and changes affect 
us, as students, most direcdy. I am a junior 
ME/EPP student, so I have been observing 
and experiencing life at CMU for three 
years. Now I would like to take a more active 
role in the campus community. We need a 
strong Senate to represent the student body 
in dealing with faculty and administration 
when policies are being made, to be certain 
that those policies have the best interests of 
the students at heart, and so that student 
sentiments on the various policies are made 
known. I want to be one of the representa
tives for CIT, to do my part to make CMU a 
good place to be.
Elizabeth Fox 
CIT
As a senator for the past year, I have served 
as Vice-Chairman of the Academic Affairs 
Committee. During that time Academic 
Affairs has been active in correcting some of 
the problems that occurred during finals 
week. Currendy we are organizing the 
annual ARP campaign which will be begin
ning soon. I was also active in last Springs 
financial aid letter-writing campaign. I 
believe Student Senates potential is under
estimated by the University, and I would 
like to see more support from students, 
faculty, and administration.

Being tuned into the situation here at

In the past, Student Senate has acted as a 
grounds for students to state their impossi
ble idea logical goals. If elected I will attempt 
to emphasize things that senate cap affect, 
like student rights. We need to work in order 
to change the alcohol policy, making it 
more liberal and allowing beer at campus 
parties. I will work for this amoung other 
things. We need to fight for more freedom, 
not accept new university policies which 
seem to be directed at eventually making this 
a dry campus. Elect me as an AMS senator, 
and you will see positive changes actually 
taking place, not just lots of talk.
My name is Michael Bett and I am run
ning for re-election for MCS senator. Presendy, I am serving on the Senate Finance 
and Judicial Committees. The Judicial 
Committee is involved in setting up a separ
ate judicial branch in order to provide the 
checks and balances our Senate needs.
I am also working on improving rapport 
between Senate and Student Organizations. 
In addition, I would like to see a greater 
amount of student input in campus affairs. 
Student Senate can be strong and can make 
changes, but it is up to you, the students, to 
make your voices heard. If you want some 
action taken or some matter resolved, you 
can come to me we will see what we can do. 
For instance, if you want a Computer 
Science major, it is up to you to come to me 
and we will petition for one. However, to do 
this I need your vote so that I can continue 
working for you and all the students of 
CMU.

I am Mary Ann Sacco and Im running 
for H&SS Student Senate. I am presently a 
sophmore, earning a B.S. in psychology and 
a member of the field hockey team. I feel 
what this University needs is a more efficient 
senate. One which keeps the students 
informed, interested, and concerned. A 
senate willing to listen to the ideas, sugges
tions, and complaints of the students, and be 
ready to take action and show results. I want 
to see the Senate do more for the people it 
represents. Too many students are apathetic 
or arent aware of the Universitys benefits. I 
want to see this changed.
So when you are at the polls remember...
For a wicked good senator and represen
tative, vote Mary Ann Sacco.
As a sophomore, Im finally finishing the 
H&SS core curriculum and after taking a 
few courses in AMS, I would like to get more 
involved in the policies regarding our col
lege. I think its about time that AMS streng
thened its student relations and became 
more united. In accomplishing this we need 
a person who is motivated, interested and

Todd Rieman
Question 1
Recently, a constituant approached me 
with this appraisal of the present studentadministration relationship: If were going 
to influence them (the administration) were 
going to have to hurt them where it counts. 
The incoming freshmen class will have 
about 1200 students which will pay approximetely $50,000 for their education for a 
value of $60 million. The next sophomore 
class will have only 900 students who will 
pay an additional $35,000 for their educa
tion for a value of only $31 million. In other 
words, a class depreciates to almost its origi
nal value in one year. Thats why we have to 
discourage prospective students from com
ing hare! Boycott sleeping bag weekends, no 
more student loans ...
Although this students calculations 
might not meet with IRS accounting stand
ards, it does represent a serious problem. On 
a campus this small, a student should not 
feel like an asset on a balance sheet. Students 
come here not only because its The Profes
sional Choice but because they feel they 
will recieve a more personalized educational 
experience than they would recieve on a 
larger, less expensive campus.
Its easy to blame the administration for 
this communication gap but I feel it should 
rest with both sides. The students showed 
the administradon that they cared about 
what happened on their campus at the stu
dent rally but allowed the administradon to 
sidestep the issue by not pursueing it on a 
beaucratic level. Rallies are great for captur
ing attendon but unless someone takes the 
responsibility of working with the adminis
tradon to solve these problems the effort that 
goes into organizing such an event is wasted.
I have met many of the people in the 
administradon and contrary to popular 
belief they are not androids conjured up by 
the roboti lab (although a few experimen
tal ones are). A vast majority of them are 
willing to help the students but are merely 
ignorant of the student wishes. Our beloved 
leader, Dr. Cyert, may not be the most sym
pathetic individual but he does appear to be 
reasonable. I believe if he is shown a way to
bIfV vLRICL
continued from page S-1
many of the students dont know much 
about Senate. The general student body is 
not aware of what Senate does and can do. 
This is something that definitely should be 
changed.
Question 5
This brings us back to the last question. 
This is very difficult to answer without 
being in Senate. Assuming the Senate has 
good relations with the administration, 
then Senate is in a good position to obtain 
information about changes in policy. It 
seems that if Senate does receive such inforcomply with student wishes without greatly 
reducing profits he would be receptive to 
almost any reasonable request.
In conclusion, I feel that the most serious 
problem facing this campus is a lack of 
communication and understanding. The 
majority of the other problems can be traced 
to this one. I will try to work with the 
administration first while not ignoring the 
advantages of more drastic measure such as 
rallies . . .
Question 2
My first project will be to persuade Senate 
to allocate the necessary cash for a plaque 
with the following inscription:
The Richard Cyert Mem
orial Student Union 
This student union is 
dedicted to Dr. Cyert for 
his years of compassion 
towards his students. He 
wishes to be remember as 
having always kept the 
University in the black.
Of course it will be complete with his pic
ture and be placed in the Skibo mens room 
until a more acceptable facility is con
structed. Although nearly every candidate in 
the past 50 years has included a student 
union in their platform, I still feel this facil
ity is essential for the transformation of this 
school from a vocational training center to 
an university where ideas are exchanged 
between people of different backgrounds.
I will also command the administrations 
respect for the students maturity. We have a 
right to participate in decisions that will 
affect this campus future. WTe should be 
responsible for our own actions and such 
rules as the alcohol policy are foolish. There 
is no reason why alcohol shouldnt be served 
at common grounds events, one of the few 
social oudets provided by the school. Its not 
like high school where we ask our mommies 
to chaperone the dance. We are mature 
enough to make these decisions ourselves. It 
cant be argued that the school is providing 
something that couldnt be found elsewhere. 
The beer delivery trucks will serve anyone. 
Therefore I propose an annual, campus
wide picnic on one of the fall registration 
days complete with live music, beer tents, 
hamburgers and hotdogs... Members of the 
faculty and administration should be 
required to attend in order to get a real grasp 
of what the students are like. Hopefully this 
will make everyone more aware of the other 
sides situation and this event will be a 
springboard to further mingling activities.
Question 3
I feel Nate has many good ideas about this 
subject. I would continue with the office 
hours, Tartan column, and WRCT radio 
show. I would also establish Fartan Grill 
hours, where I would sit in the Fartan Grill 
for disinated hours so students could 
approach me without entering an office. I 
would also encourage Dr. Cyert to sit next to 
me during these hours.
I would also try to attend Student Organi
zations meeting semi-regularly if permitted. 
I feel that the president should act as a mod
erator between these organizations 
senate because many of the problems 
a rise between the two could be avoided 
this method.
Question 4
Strengths: Good enthusiam, hard 
ing, involvement, Andy Stahl
Weaknesses: Lack of direction, Toqi 
to become hostile, Dont look for thedij 
matic approach, Andy Stahl
Question 5
Yes, not really but Im sick and tira 
answering these questions.
Question 6
Finially, Im almost finished. I have 
a Senator for one semester which is k 
enough to get an idea about how 
things done but not long enough to esi 
lish any ties to the organization. I have 
worked in many organizations before 
require the same kind of beaucratic B, 
get things done.
mation, it is not being effectively passed to 
the constituency.
Question 6
I feel that I have certain qualities that will 
help me in the position of President of Stu
dent Senate. I know and can get along with 
may different types of people. I am a hard 
worker and am willing to become very 
involved. Although the only experience I 
bring to this job is that from high school, 
where I was president of the student body for 
two years, I feel that I am well prepared for 
this position.
Sometimes, when people are inside an 
organization, it becomes difficult to see the 
situation from an outside perspective. After 
three years at CMU, I have seen and expe
rienced may of its problems and feel that 
with the help of the present senators, I can 
improve the effectiveness of the Senate.
So you forgot to pay your housing dep
osit? Oh, the FAF  was I supposed to file it 
last month? What do you mean the last date 
to drop classes was two weeks ago? Sound 
familiar? After having flailed thorugh 
almost three vears of life at CMU, I have
been wondering why I still dont knows) 
of these things.
The reason is simple  no one ever 
me. There is a definite communion 
problem here, and I for one, would liketc 
something about it. The positon of Pi 
dent of Student Senate is such that them 
mation and means of distributing

the best advantage. The year of apath 
over  lets make this a year of informal

emphasis on constituent opinions as 
opposed to personal opinions.
Weakness Bureaucratic Bullshit. Many 
Senators still put far more emphasis on the 
Rules rather than what is indeed norma
tive. This is not to say that Senate should 
openly defy rules, but rather that it 
shouldnt allow fear erf rules to be its chief 
driving force.
Question 5
Surprisingly the relationship is not as 
poor as one might be led to believe. 
Although we are not Buddy Buddy with 
the folks in Warner Hall, we have succeeded 
in providing realistic input for one 
another and have undoubtably removed
many superficially patronizing aspects of 
this relationship.
My main goal is continuance in the devel
opment of a humanistic relationship 
between these two entities, in which we may 
someday treat one another as equals (figure 
that one out!).
Question 6
Last year I was the youngest candidate 
and thusly brought with me a fresh 
approach with new ideas and innovation. 
However this year I am the oldest candidate 
carrying maturity, wisdom, and experience 
into the position. Above all else, I am the 
most realistic candidate (just ask Tony 
Martin).
