Last Tuesday, in a regular meeting of 
the Inter-F ratemity Council (IFC) at ATO, 
the Panhellenic (Panhel) Society an
nounced that the sororities were pulling 
out of IFC until specific changes are im
plemented.
The action was preceded by the issuing 
of a formal petition, drafted by the sorori
ties, which was addressed and sent to Ron 
Campana, Director of Greek Affairs, with 
additional copies being sent to Deans 
Walter and Cox and Vice President for 
Enrollment William Elliott.
Reading aloud from the letter, Denise 
Visconti, president of Panhel, announced 
in the meeting that the sororities are 
seeking a reorganization of the current 
IFC structure, sighting what they per
ceive as an exclusive bias toward frater
nity business, rather than that of the 
Greek system as a whole.
Visconti said that the current system 
doesnt allow Panhel to be an integral part 
of the IFC, and that because of this, the 
sororities were becoming increasingly 
unhappy with the whole process.
The letter called for a total restructur
ing of the IFC, with the creation of a 
Greek Council, which would be chaired 
equally by both Panhel and the Council of 
fraternity presidents (CFP).
Visconti said that this would not only 
allow for a more equal system, but would 
also provide for better communication be
tween the sororities and fraternities.
IFC President Chris Pace stated,I do 
agree that the structure of the IFC in its 
present state is inefficient, and thus the 
effectiveness is lowered.
Pace also stated,

can benefit organizational-wise from par
alleling some of the houses (governmen
tal) structures. He went on to say that he 
doesnt see the representative changes 
mentioned in the letter as requiring a 
major reorganization process.
Pace thinks emphasis should be placed 
instead on increasing the exchange proc
ess between the sororities and fraterni
ties, stating, Im more concerned with 
communication lines being opened.
Although the issue was not mentioned 
in Panhels letter, Visconti added that the 
sororities also feel that there is a need for 
faculty involvement in Greek life, mainly 
in an advisory capacity.
Currently, a few fraternities have such 
advisors on a strictly unofficial basis, but 
Campana reported that its not the rule, 
its the exception. Campana continued, 
I think that faculty involvement in the 
Greek system is essential, and very wel
come.
While there is some agreement within 
the fraternities on the sororities claims, 
there is nevertheless marked objection to 
what they consider to be the drastic way 
in which Panhel went about rectifying the 
situation.
Additionally, it is seen by the fraterni
ties as an effort by the sororities to place 
themselves in a position of power.
Pace attributes the propensity toward 
fraternity-oriented business during the 
IFC meetings to the disproportionate size 
of the sororities as opposed to the frater
nities. Currently, there are 14 fraterni
ties, encompassing approximately 900 
members, as opposed to five sororities, 
having approximately 200 members.
Pace also stated, Last night (Friday)

Thursday, United States At
torney General Dick Thornburgh 
addressed The Next Twenty 
Years Symposium, sponsored by 
Carnegie Mellons School of 
Urban and Public Affairs (SUPA). 
The symposium was part of 
SUPAs twentieth anniversary 
celebration. (See related article, 
page 3).
Thornburghs keynote address 
was titled Reinvigorating Gov
ernment. His remarks specifi
cally discussed how to attract 
good people into public service. 
Thornburgh is also director of 
the Institute of Politics at Har
vard Universitys John F. Ken
nedy School of Government.
What are those factors which 
will attract good men and women 
to public service? Many factors 
deserve discussion, but I believe 
the three most important today 
are: compensation, integrity, and 
leadership, said Thornburgh to 
a crowd gathered in Skibos ball
room.
Todays student can help by 
moving from the me generation 
to the I generation, that is, a
J i, generation of intelligence, integ
rity, and inspiration, he contin
ued.
Responding to a question after 
his address, the Attorney Gen
eral said Governing is not about 
devising policies, it is about turn
ing those policies into programs 
that are going to improve the 
quality of life of people in this 
country.
According to SUPAs Dean 
Alfred Blumstein, the main 
theme of the symposium was to 
look at the next twenty years and 
the problems facing the nation. 
The symposium consisted of 
three sections: Demographic 
Trends for the Next 20 Years, 
The Role of Government in 
Shaping Americas Future, and 
Human Capital and Economic 
Health.
The sessions were organized 
as panel discussions, with differ
ent points of view being repre
sented.
Speakers at the symposium 
included former North Carolina 
governor James Hunt, Jr., presi
dent of the American Federation 
of Teachers Albert Shanker, and 
Dean of MITs Sloan School of 
Management Lester Thurow.
Fire causes blackout at 
Mellon Institute and SEI
By JONATHAN LEVY
Tartan Assistant News Editor
Last Wednesday a power out
age hit part of Oakland leaving 
Mellon Institute, the SEI build
ing, and other buildings without 
power for 40 minutes.
According to Duquesne Light 
Company, a fire in a manhole 
cover in front of the Carnegie 
Museum caused them to lose 
power in one of their cables at 
4:05 pm. The area between 4400 
and 5000 on Forbes and Fifth 
Avenues was without power until 
4:45 pm. 4400 Forbes and 4400 
Fifth are the western edges of the 
Carnegie Museum and Mellon 
Institute. Warner Hall is at 5000 
Forbes.
The area was transferred to
another power line until the 
blown cable was repaired at 2:17 
am Thursday.
The Carnegie Mellon Police 
Department said there was no 
known damage in either Mellon 
Institute or SEI. The Pittsburgh 
Police Department also reported 
that they had not received any 
complaints related to the black
out. Carnegie Mellon Director of 
Environmental Health and 
Safety Peter Collopy said that 
one experiment in Mellon Insti
tute exploded during the black
out but it is not known whether 
the explosion was caused by the 
power outage. Collopys depart
ment is investigating.

When Thornburgh resigned 
from the ACLU he cited conflict 
of interest reasons. At a press 
conference after his speech he 
contended that he had disagreed 
with many of the ACLUs posi

been his style to mention these 
objections when he resigned.

Akram Midani, Dean of CFA, 
said that because of the consoli
dation CFA will lose several 
thousand square feet of space 
(due to L-shaped design of MM) 
but... it will make a better com

Architecture, Drama and Music 
departments. A two floor addi

to be built in the future, and will 
house freshmen studios for Archi

The renovation of MM and the 
consolidation of CFA was pro
posed four years ago by a com
mittee headed by Omer Akin, 
department head of Architecture. 
It was a solution to the problems 
cited by the Master Plan. The 
problem was that CFA had be
tween 40 and 45 percent of its 
departments outside the original 
CFA building, in Doherty, Por

faculty in various departments 
to relate to each other. Midani

Chess computer beats grandmaster
Hitech, Carnegie Mellons chess-playing computer, triumphed 
easily in its four-game match against grandmaster Arnold 
Denker, winning the last game in 23 moves. The victory last 
Sunday marked the first time a chess program had beaten a 
grandmaster.
This is a machine with a sharp game," Denker said. It plays 
the openings beautifully. Unfortunately, I played badly. Most 
experts agreed that Denker, noted for his imaginative combina
tion play and sacrificial attacks, was badly off form. It also was 
pointed out that he is 74 years old and does not play very much 
chess these days. The final score for the match was 3 1/2 for 
Hitech to one-half for Denker, who admitted that the victory was 
an impressive achievement for a computer program.
I was very pleased with the way Hitech played, and Im very 
hard to please, said Hans Berliner, the Carnegie Mellon com
puter scientist who headed the Carnegie Mellon team that 
created Hitech. Berliner and his associates are working on an 
improved model of Hitech that, he says, is about three years 
from completion.

Gorbachev takes 
Soviet presidency
MOSCOW (AP)  The Communist Partys policy-making 
Central Committee met Friday 
morning in a hastily-organized 
session to discuss a reorganiza
tion of the party structure.
The official Soviet news agency, 
Toss, said Soviet leader Mikhail 
Gorbachev was making a report 
to the 300 members of the Cen
tral Committee, which is made 
up of party, government and 
military leaders.
Following the Central Commit
tee meeting an equally unusual 
gathering of the 1,500-member 
Supreme Soviet, the nations par
liament, 'was called for Satur
day.
Observers said the Supreme 
Soviet meeting was called to ap
prove any decisions made by the 
Central Committee.
Besides broad poiicy decisions, 
the Central Committee can make 
changes in its own membership 
or in the ruling 13-man party 
Politburo.
Soviet President Andrei A. 
Gromyko was retired from the 
ruling Politburo Friday at his 
own request, a Soviet official said. 
On Saturday Gromyko also re
signed his position as president. 
Gorbachev was elected to take 
his place.
Gorbachev, with his dual titles 
of President of the Soviet Union 
and General Secretary of the 
Communist Party, has become 
the first Soviet leader since Le
onid Brezhnev to be both head of 
state and head of the party. 
Gorbachev said that he has plans 
to make the Soviet presidency a 
powerful position rather than the 
figurehead it has been in the past.
Gorbachev lauded the merits 
and achievements of Gromyko 
and wished him the best, indicat
ing he was leaving in good stand
ing.
In what appeared to be the 
biggest single power shift in the 
Kremlin since Gorbachev took 
power, Anatoly F. Dobrynin, the 
longtime Soviet ambassador to 
Washington, was sent into re
tirement from his post as party 
foreign affairs secretary. He had 
been regarded as a key Gor
bachev adviser but had never 
been elevated to the Politburo.
A number of other Soviet offi
cials were also displaced Satur
day. Among the most significant 
moves was the removal of Viktor 
Chebrikov as head of the KGB. 
Chebrikov had been the chair
man of the KGB since 1982. He 
was replaced by Vladimir 
Kryuchkov, a deputy chairman 
of the KGB since 1978.
U.S. ends Kuwaiti 
ship reflagging
NEW YORK (AP)  President

Gulf.
Presidential spokesman Mar

agan acted after reviewing the 
current cease-fire, which has been 
in effect since Aug. 20, and con
sulting with allies and friends in 
the region.
There have been no attacks on 
gulf shipping since the cease-fire 
began.
Nobel Peace Prize 
awarded to UN
OSLO, Norway (AP)  The 
Nobel Committee Thursday 
named U.N. peacekeeping forces 
around the world as winners of 
the 1988 Nobel Peace Prize.
The committee cited the forces 
for building a confidence in the 
United Nations that allows it to 
play a growing role in global af
fairs.
The five-member committee 
praised the blue-bereted troops 
in the Middle East, Cyprus and 
the Indian subcontinent for sub
duing tensions where armistices 
have substituted for peace.
The citation said the 
peacekeepers have played a 
significant role in reducing the 
level of conflict even though the 
fundamental causes of the 
struggles frequently remain.
The prize will be awarded at a 
ceremony Dec. 10.
Israeli paper says 
United States is 
dealing with Iran
JERUSALEM (AP)  An Israeli newspaper reported Friday 
that eight American captives and 
one British hostage held in Leba
non will be released in October as 
a result of secret talks between 
the United States and Iran, i
In exchange for the release, 
Washington will provide eco
nomic aid, gradually release bil
lions of dollars in Iranian funds 
frozen in U.S. banks and resume 
diplomatic relations with Tehran, 
the English-language weekly The 
Nation said in a report from 
Geneva.
The Nation said in its unattrib
uted report that the secret nego
tiations between Tehran and 
Washington began in Geneva last 
Monday. The newspaper began 
publishing four weeks ago so it 
was difficult to judge the reports 
credibility.
The Iranian delegation told 
U.S. representatives that the proIranian Shiite Moslems holding 
the hostages in Lebanon de
manded $3 million in ransom and 
immunity from prosecution, The 
Nation said. The captors appear
to have dropped their demand 
for the release of 17 Shiite Mos
lems held in Kuwait, the news
paper said.
The American delegates re
sponded that they were not in a 
position to pay ransom, the re
port said.
Under an agreement worked 
out in Geneva, five American 
hostages will be released around 
Oct. 7, and the second group of 
three Americans and an English
man is to be freed a week later, 
the report said.
The British hostage is thought 
to be Anglican Church envoy 
Terry Waite who disappeared in 
Lebanon last year, The Nation 
said.
President Reagan denied the 
reports Friday. We arent nego
tiating directly with Iran. We 
havent talked to the kidnappers, 
he said shortly after arriving in 
Chicago on a political trip. I think 
maybe Iran is putting these sto
ries out, he added.

Discovery launch 
puts U.S. back 
in space
CAPE CANAVERAL (DJ)  
The space shuttle Discovery was 
launched Thursday, its crew of 
five astronauts becoming the first 
Americans to venture into space 
since the Challenger disaster of 
January 1986.
Lift-off was at 11:37 am EDT. 
It was delayed from its sched
uled 9:59 am launch time by 
peculiarly light head winds along 
the shuttles flight path. NASA 
said spacecraft computers, con
figured to expect autumn winds 
in a certain range, do not have 
adequate data to steer the craft 
through weak winds at higher al
titudes. 
The shuttle Discovery went into 
orbit at about 11:45 am EDT, 
almost nine minutes after launch. 
The three main engines shut 
down, and the Discovery astro
nauts were in outer space.
The Discovery crew is com
manded by Navy Capt. Freder
ick Hauck. The other crew mem
bers are the pilot, Air Force Col. 
Richard Covey, and mission spe
cialists John M. Lounge, George 
D. Pinky Nelson and Marine 
Lt. Col. David C. Hilmers.
Well practically be flying a 
shakedown flight of a new space
craft, Covey said of the 26th 
shuttle flight. Because of more 
than 450 post-Challenger modi
fications, he predicted, There 
probably will be some surprises, 
but overall well have a safer 
vehicle.
Newly designed booster rock
ets will provide the initial thrust.
It was a failure in a rocket seal 
that led to the Jan. 26, 1986., 
disaster that killed the sev^ 
Challenger crew members.
The Discoverys voyage was not 
merely a trip into space. In the 
four days, the astronauts had sey. 
eral experiments to conduct and 
were to deploy a $100 million 
communications satellite builtbj 
TRW Inc.s Space and Technq}. 
ogy Group. That deployment was 
scheduled for the Discoverys fifth

The year 1968 was a tumultu
ous year: the assassinations of 
King and Kennedy, the invasion 
df Czechoslovakia, and the escatgtion of the Vietnam war. It was 
Iteo a period of great optimism: 
London Johnsons Great Society 
^as in full swing and three men 
orbited the moon.
It was in this optimistic atmos
phere that the School of Urban 
gild Public Affairs was created.

leaders to address the complex 
problems facing America.
At The Next Twenty Years 
Symposium held Thursday, Car

Cyert recounted the events that 
led to the creation of SUPA,

Since then SUPA has grown 
into a nationally respected insti

Margaret Morrison Carnegie 
Hall to new offices in Hamburg 
Hall.
The SUPAsfirst students were 
admitted in 1970 and graduated
in 1972. Many of the schools 
original graduates are now at

SUPA has one of the highest 
minority enrollments of any 
graduate school in the country. 
Last years M.S. class was 44 
percent female, 38 percent mi

SUPA offers graduate degrees 
in policy analysis, financial man

Tartan Staffwriter
The Carnegie Institute of 
Technologys (CIT) Dean 
Search Committee has nar
rowed its search foranewDean 
to two candidates, whose 
names could not be given for 
privacy reasons.
A recommendation to the 
Administration is expected by 
the end of October, according 
to Jerry Griffin, head of the 
search committee.
If contract negotiations are 
successful, the new dean is ex
pected to begin either in Janu

meantime, Dr. Richard G. 
Luthy, Associate Dean of CIT 
and professor of civil engineer
ing, will act as dean.
Of the two candidates for 
the position, one is currently a
memberofCamegieMellons fac
ulty and the other is from outside 
of the University.
An announcement was circu
lated within CIT askingfor nomi
nations for the position. Adver
tisements for the position were 
also published in several educa
tion journals around the coun
try. Of the several internal nomi
nations made, however, only one 
was accepted.
According to Jerry Griffin, the 
search committee is looking for 
the following qualities: manage
ment skills, research ability, 
national prominence, educational 
vision, distinguished tekching, 
scholarship, understanding proc
ess and goals of undergraduate 
and graduate education, and 
some type of university adminis
trative experience.
Former CIT Dean James Wil
liams last official day as Dean
was August 31, 1988. He is 
now working for General Elec
tric Corp. in Cincinnati, Ohio.
The search committee, se

Planners at CMU and Pitt design high speed rail
By DAVID J. WHELAN
Jartan Staffwriter
Although currently only in the 
preliminary planning stages, 
researchers at Carnegie Mellon 
and the University of Pittsburgh 
are actively considering imple
menting a high speed magnetic 
levitation passenger train sys
tem in Pittsburgh.
,-Xed by Dr. Richard A. Uher, 
rector of CMUs High Speed 
pround Transportation (HSGT) 
Center, scientists at CMU and 
Pitt are beginning to research 
jhe possibilities of constructing a 
MAGLEV rail system in the 
'ittsburgh area.
However, Uher stated, it is still 
$iuch too early to make any plans 
(or the near future.
According to Raymond Reaves, 
planning director for Allegheny 
County, Uher met with county 
fficials concerning the 
MAGLEV, and they are enthusi
astic about the prospects.
! Reaves commented that the 
feasibility of a high speed train in 
Pittsburgh certainly should be 
investigated.
j A consortium is being formed 
the area to help develop a plan 
r a possible rail system.
Reaves stated that such tech
nology will definitely be in place 
Within the next century, so he is 
^xcited by the opportunity to be a 
Part of the ground level plan
ning.
Both Reaves and Uher feel that 
MAGLEV system in the area 
uld serve as a demonstration of 
[e technologys power.
The advantages of MAGLEV
technology over typical trains are 
great. In addition to traveling 
much faster than conventional 
U.S. systems, MAGLEV trains 
are quieter, more efficient, and 
more environmentally safe.
Unlike most trains currently 
in use in the United States, 
MAGLEV trains resemble mono
rails.
However, a MAGLEV train 
floats above its track on a mag
netic field which attracts and 
repulses the train to propel it 
and maintain its stability.
Using this technology, experi
mental units have reached speeds 
of over 300 m.p.h. while remain
ing safe for passengers.
The main drawback to 
MAGLEV trains is the price. 
Germanys Transrapid system, 
which is slated for general use in 
1990, will probably cost about 
$16 million per mile of track.
According to Reaves, local gov
ernment funding for a Pittsburgh 
MAGLEV is not available, especially 
after the recent busway expansions 
and the $550 million addition to the 
Greater Pittsburgh International 
Airport, which is scheduled to open 
in 1992.
The HSGT Center is currently 
seeking funding from corporations 
which might have an interest in the 
technology.
American Standards Union 
Switch and Signal Division is al
ready providing some support, and 
other companies, such as Westinghouse Electric Corporation, are 
being approached.
Uher mentioned that the HSGT 
Center will also seek technical and 
financial support from the German 
and Japanese firms which have been 
researching and implementing 
MAGLEV systems since the late 
1960s.

University Center to be built 
after 1990 commencement
By PRISCILLIA HSUE
Tartan Staffwriter
A new Student Center will be 
the spotlight of CMUs future 
campus.
The University Center is only 
part of an overall plan created by 
the architectural firm of Dennis, 
Clark, and Associates, winners 
of a design competition held by 
the University. The new build
ing will be located on the current 
site of Skibo and is planned to 
cover over 200,000 square feet.
The proposed center will form 
a new surrounding to bring to
gether both students and faculty. 
Areas inside will include offices, 
meeting rooms, University shops, 
and both leisure and formal 
spaces. Additionally, intramural 
athletic facilities such as a gym, 
pool, and track will be housed 
inside the center.
According to Pat Keating, the 
Vice President of University 
Planning, the current status of 
the project is that the University 
is building a new' East Campus 
dorm with a new dining facility
to replace Kiltie. We cant just 
tear it down and start building 
the center,  Keating stated. Af
ter the dorm is finished, Skibo 
will be demolished and then we 
can start. Keating predicted that 
the dorm will be completed in 
1990, and that the soonest con
struction can begin on the Stu
dent Center is after the 1990 
commencement ceremonies.
The proposed University Cen
ter will cost CMU $30-$35 mil
lion to build. Currently, a study 
is being conducted to determine 
methods to break this figure into 
parts so that construction can 
begin sooner. The university has 
already started fund-raising ef
forts.
The Dennis and Clark campus 
design impressed judges on the 
selection committee by retaining 
Henry Hornbostels original 
campus image while keeping 
CMU up-to-date. The total 
scheme includes not only the 
university center but also a new 
dormitory complex, performing 
arts center, playing fields, and 
parking garage.
In addition, there is a chance 
that the Carnegie Mellon re
searchers will receive some 
funding from a $400 million 
bill that U.S. Senator Daniel 
P. Moynihan (D-NY) is cur
rently sponsoring, although 
Uher stated that, even if the 
bill is passed, it may take 
several years before any money 
is allocated.
The High Speed Ground 
Transportation Center was es
tablished in January 1987, 
after the Boeing Aerospace 
Company decided to end its 
U.S. Urban Mass Transporta
tion Administration-funded 
MAGLEV research and devel
opment.
The HSGT Center is cur
rently the only universitybased research group investi
gating high speed ground 
transportation.

Apple has always been a little ahead of its time. From 
the Introduction of the first popular personal computer, 
to the first system to use graphic user interface, to the 
first desktop publishing system, our goal has always been 
the same: to change the world with computers.
That goal results in a company that is every bit 
as advanced as its products. In many ways, Apple is well 
on its way to becoming the first 21st century company 
in the Fortune 200.
Where the typical company emphasizes hierarchy, 
at Apple we stress networks. Instead of mandates coming 
down from the top, ideas percolate throughout the organi
zation. We give our people unusual amounts of responsi
bility. Extraordinary tools to let them do their best work. 
And an eclectic environment conducive to changing the 
world.
Add to that unusual environment all of the 
resources a major corporation can provide. Sophisticated 
management. Astute marketing. International distribution. 
And you have the elements of the first company of the 
next century: Apple.

At CMU I planned to be openly gay...
Excuse me, this section is closing 
in two minutes. Youll have tomove. 
Ever heard that from a Dining 
Service employee? If so, youre not 
alone.
Its standard practice at More
Pizza to close one section of the eat
ing area at about 9:30 for cleanup  
even if it means shifting a few cus
tomers.
And how about later? Have you 
ever dined at MorePizza to the 
sound of a vacuum cleaner? Great 
atmosphere, isnt it?
MorePizzas management policies 
arent unique. Across the board, 
CMDS seems to have forgotten who 
its customers are. Consider:
Kiltie Cafe
Kiltie starts gearing down for 
its 7:00 pm closing at 6:15. One serv
ice line closes at 6:30, although 
Kilties peak dinner hour is 5:30 to 
6:30, according to Director of Dining 
Service Jim Gurley. Food quality 
drops noticeably at 6:00  right 
when most students are eating.
At the beginning of October, the 
8:00 am breakfast rush  nor
mally a phenomenon witnessed only 
during the first week of classes  
continues. At 7:55, the line stretches 
to the far cash register, yet only one 
serving line is open.
During rush periods, Kiltie often 
runs out of silverware. It normally 
takes about five to seven minutes for 
it to be replaced.
 Kilties silverware and trays are 
often poorly cleaned. At times, 
clean trays are covered with 
ketchup and other food.
As of last Wednesday, only one 
orange juice spigot worked. The other 
spigots had been broken for at least 
24 hours, and none were fixed until 
Thursday lunch.
Kiltie servers often handle food 
with their bare hands.
Kiltie servers are instructed to 
serve only one entree at a time to 
' each customer, even if the customer 
asks for more. Sometimes that en
tree is as small as a fish fillet.
MorePizza
Under the 1988-89 price scheme, 
a small pepperoni pizza costs $3.65, 
and a small soft drink costs $0.60. 
Yet the contract allowance for late 
night is only $4.15. Add it up.
A Soho Soda costs $1.10. The 
same soda is available at Scotland 
Yard for $0.90.
Delivery service is available only 
to those students living in on-campus housing. MorePizza will not 
deliver to the 313 students who live 
in university-owned, off-campus 
housing like Shirley Apartments, to 
say nothing of those living in offcampus apartments in the area sur
rounding campus.
MorePizza will only deliver cer
tain items. No matter how large an 
order a student places, he or she 
cannot get a small pizza or a Soho 
Soda.
Onion rings and cheese sticks 
have been removed from the More
Pizza menu.
Morewood Dining
The cashier will no longer give 
out an ice cream coupon worth more 
than one ice cream, no matter how 
much money is left on the customers 
contract.
A piece of fruit  like a banana
 costs $0.40.
Tartan Grill
The price of a cheeseburger 
jumped from $1.15 last year to $1.60 
this year. Thats a 40% increase. 
CMDS claims that the amount of 
meat in a cheeseburger has gone 
from 1/5 pound to 1/4 (pre-cooked), 
but thats still only a 20% increase. 
Over the same period, the contract 
allowance for dinner has increased 
only 3%.
The time from when a student 
enters the Grill until he or she sits 
down at a table can last 20 minutes 
at 7:30 pm.
Most Tartan Grill servers seem 
unable to remember more than one 
item at a time. Typically, a server 
will make four trips to fill one order.
The new feeder line does not 
speed service. Rather, it acts only to 
mask the inefficiency of the counter 
servers. Further, a Dining Service 
employee is paid to tell some of the 
countrys brightest college students 
which line is the shortest.
Holders for items like condi
ments, napkins, and straws are 
empty more often than they are full.
In general
 MorePizza opens the latest of any 
Dining Service establishment, yet it 
closes at midnight. Last years 
Quality of Life Task Force found 
that the average student pulls four 
all-nighters a semester. Many 
students stay up regularly until 3:00.
No matter how hungry students 
are, they can eat only one meal on 
their contract during any meal pe
riod. This means that students who 
eat at 10:00 am Saturday mornings 
have to wait until 4:00 pm to use 
their contract again.
Across the board, it seems most 
Dining Service employees have a 
bad attitude. Its as if they dont 
want to have to deal with students.
Carnegie Mellon Dining Service 
has taken the service out of dining. 
Given the fact that most students 
pay CMDS over $1400 annually, 
thats more than inconvenient. Its 
unacceptable.
Its time for Dining Service to 
realize who pays the bills.
Editor:
As concerns Donna Grears article of 
Sept. 20 (CMU Students lack under
standing, knowledge): I am a member 
of the CMU gay community. I have not, 
thankfully, as yet experienced any open 
discrimination here at CMU due to my 
sexual preference. What I have found 
here (and elsewhere) is a far more in
sidious and stifling form of discrimina
tion. It is not spoken, and seldom is it 
acted upon.
It concerns the very concept of com
ing out, a much thrown-about phrase in 
the media. If there were no discrimina
tion on campus (in Pittsburgh, in the 
world), there would be no coming out. 
The choice of ones sexual partners would 
be of such little import that one would 
not have to agonize over its disclosure.
Here at CMU I had planned on being 
openly gay, but when I arrived I felt
Editor:
In response to Nathan Longs letter to 
the editor concerning my article [CMU 
students lack understanding, knowl
edge, September 20] I would like to 
make a few clarifications.
First, I will admit that there was a 
substantial amount of contradictions in 
my article, but not because I was mak
ing them. Students responses concern
ing gays on campus are contradictory in 
themselves. Homosexuality is a sensi
tive issue which results in mixed emo
tions for many people. I merely pre
sented the evidence I received from 
others.
I resent the fact that Long stated that 
healmost believed that the article...was 
a political move to create complacency 
on campus... Without inserting my own 
opinion, which would probably shock 
many people who dont know me, I tried 
to present an unbiased article based 
upon evidence of the general attitude 
toward gays which exists on this cam
pus. Although I am sure I should have 
talked with more students, if time had 
permitted, I still stand by the conclusion 
that the general attitude of this campus 
toward gays is one of complacency. I do 
not, however, advocate that compla
cency. I think that everyone should make 
a decision concerning the issue and then 
stand by that decision, whatever it may 
be, without simply ignoring the fact that 
homosexuality does exist on this cam
pus.
I never claimed that prejudice did not 
exist on this campus, I merely claimed 
that blatant discrimination was not the 
norm. I still do not think that prejudice 
is the reason that many heterosexuals 
feel uncomfortable around homosexu
als nor do I think that one can equate 
homosexuality with being a vegetarian 
or with eating dogs. Segregation is a 
loaded word, but it does appear that the 
homosexual population is a bit isolated 
from the heterosexual population here 
on this campus.
The reasons for this isolation are not 
always visible on the surface. My con
clusion was the factor of comfort. Per
haps I am wrong, and if so, then maybe 
someone else will take it upon themself 
to present another opinion with first
hand knowledge. I cannot and did not 
intend to speak for every student on 
campus, regardless of whether they are
Letters to the Editor
something unspoken that told me to 
bide my time. Now, onlythose very close 
to me know that I am gay. It is not that 
I lie to the others and say I am straight; 
it is just the non-disclosure of an inte
gral part of my being. Some say this is 
being untrue to myself, and they may be 
right. But this is a gut reaction to a 
problem; right or wrong, it is how I feel.
It is not, I believe, paranoia on my 
part. There was a time when I was 
openly gay. Everyone I knew was aware 
of my sexuality. And (coincidence) many 
people previously close to me began to 
pull away.
I didnt tell my friends at CMU that I 
was gay until our relationships prohomosexual or heterosexual. If other 
reasons for isolation exist, which Im 
sure they do, then let the people with 
other opinions speak up. I merely pre
sented an hypothesis from the informa
tion which I was given.
Acceptance doesnt necessarily mean 
you are comfortable with someone. There 
are certain people whose personalities 
intimidate or annoy me, yet I accept 
them as human beings with many of the 
same hurts and joys as myself. I do not, 
however, enjoy spending large amounts 
of time with them.
One can also accept someone without 
agreeing with that person. One of my 
best friends on this campus is an agnos
tic while I am a Christian. Obviously we 
do not agree with each other concerning 
the matter of religion; however, we ac
cept each other and love each other. 
Acceptance is not a synonym for agree
ment.
I do believe that a substantial number 
of students on campus accept gays al
though they might not agree with them 
concerning the issue of homosexuality. I 
also believe, just as Long does, that 
there is also a substantial number who 
merely tolerate them. I think I pre
sented examples of both types in my ar
ticle, and merely concluded that although 
the tolerant attitude exists (i.e. people

That is the attitude I see as more 
dangerous to gay rights and acceptance 
for the gay community. While being 
tolerant of my lifestyle, until they knew 
me these people would not have ac
cepted me and gotten to know me.
This form of discrimination, unfortu
nately, DOES exist at CMU, and to such 
an extent that I cannot sign my. name.

who use words such as fags and 
queers and who stare blatantly), the 
attitude of disagreeing with yet accept
ing gays as human beings who live, love, 
and laugh is also present.
Long is correct in a few of his assump
tions. Perhaps the article did not differ
entiate between tolerance and accep
tance as well as it should have, and 
perhaps it didnt, give an accurate pic
ture of the blatant prejudice which does 
exist, but that is simply because most of 
the people I talked with didnt see them
selves as prejudiced and did not advo
cate discrimination against homosexu
als. Perhaps many people simply do not 
wish to admit their own prejudice, but 
that is something for which I cannot be 
held accountable.
I purposely did not take a stand for or 
against homosexuality so that I could 
present the information I received in an 
unbiased manner, and I think because 
of this Long inserted some opinions of 
his own and attributed them to me. I 
had no intention of advocating a politi
cal ploy for complacency, and I apologize 
if it appeared that way. Homosexuality 
is definitely an issue which cannot and 
should not be ignored.

The man who gives Dukakis military adviceFetal dilemma: To be

If youve ever taken Decision 
Processes or made it through 
Thursdays test, then youve 
probably read Essence of Deci
sion by Graham T. Allison. But I 
bet you dont know what Allison 
has been doing lately.
For those of you who havent 
taken DP, Allison is one of the 
founders of decision science at 
Harvard. Today he is Dean of 
Harvards John F. Kennedy 
School of Government. Astute 
Michael Dukakis watchers will 
recall that the Governor spent 
1978 to 1982 at Harvard when 
the people of Massachusetts gave 
him a politicians version of a 
Deans vacation.
As of late, Allison has been 
advising Dukakis on military 
strategy and policy. And its no 
coincidence that the opinions that
Having trouble finding any 
difference between Presidential 
candidates Michael Dukakis and 
George Bush besides their 
height? The campus group Edu
cational Action of Latin America 
researched Dukakis and Bushs 
policies on Latin America, and 
though there are some similari
ties, we also found many sub
stantial contrasts in their views 
of our neighbors to the south. 
Their policies on countries in the 
region, as well as their attitudes 
towards treaties and charters and 
economic development, will be 
an important issue given that 
both candidates are trying to win 
the Hispanic vote.
One of their most obvious dif
ferences is over Nicaragua. Re
agan and Bush believe that the 
Nicaraguan government is a 
threat to the region and must be 
crushed at almost any cost. For 
the past eight years, the Reagan/ 
Bush administration has been 
committed to overthrowing the 
Nicaraguan govemmentby force. 
Like Reagan, Bush calls the 
Sandinistas a Communist re
gime and the contra forces free
dom fighters. The Reagan/Bush 
administration has provided 
extensive military and political 
support to the contras, conducted 
a Naval blockade of Nicaragua 
and imposed a trade embargo 
against that country, making it 
illegal for US companies to do 
business with it. Bush is certain 
to continue these policies if he 
becomes President. Dukakis, 
despite the fact that he chose 
pro-contra Senator Bentsen as 
his running mate, thinks that

up in Dukakiss position papers 
and speeches. In fact Dukakis 
remarked in 1982 that he would 
use his second term as governor 
as a test of what I have learned 
and what we try to teach at the 
[Kennedy] school.
If youre interested in what 
advice the Democratic candidate 
has been getting, go to Hunt and 
check out Hawks, Doves, and 
Owls. It was co-authored by Alli
son and it contains An Agenda 
for Avoiding Nuclear War.
In case you cant find it at Hunt, 
heres a summary:
 Modernize the strategic triad.
Peter Shell
the most pressing problem is 
poverty and landlessness, rather 
than the Sandinistas. He is 
against contra aid and says that 
democracy will be brought to the 
region by negotiation and abid
ing by treaties instead. He wants 
normal relations with Nicaragua, 
and was one of the governors who 
filed suit against the US govern
ment to refuse to send his Na
tional Guard troops to Honduras 
fortrainingexercises, saying that 
such exercises are needlessly 
provocative towards Nicaragua.
Their differences regarding El 
Salvador are not as stark. Al
though Bush admits that there is 
a problem with the death 
squads, he claims that the 
Salvadoran government has put 
an end to their activities (a claim 
which has been disputed by 
Americas Watch and other hu
man rights organizations). The 
death squads are supported by 
the El Salvador military and have 
been responsible for the kidnap
ping, torture and murder of thou
sands of Salvadorans in the past 
sevenyears. Despite the.fact that 
the Salvadoran government has 
little control over the death 
squads or military, which rou
tinely bombs civilian towns in 
the hopes of winning the civil 
war there, Bush supports con
tinuing massive US aid to the 
government and military. 
Dukakis also supports aiding the 
government, although he speaks

 Strengthen NATO and the 
Rapid Deployment Forces.
This list is hardly the agenda of 
the far left.
The owls of Harvard dont put 
much stock in the Strategic De
fense Initiative, saying, There 
are sound military reasons fa
voring continued research on 
defensive systems, but it should 
not be assumed that such re
search will lead to an effective 
defense of cities.
Dont get the idea that Allison 
just advises Democrats on deout against militarization and 
human-rights abuses, and says 
that peace and security are not 
the sole responsibility of the US.
The two major candidates 
views on treaties and charters 
affecting the region differ re
markably. Dukakis notes that the 
Arias peace plan, which was 
signed by 
the presi
dents of five 
Central 
American 
countries in 
Guatemala 
last year, 
applies 
equally to 
each gov
ernment 
and guerilla group in the region, 
as well as outside powers (such 
as the US and Soviet Union). He 
thinks that by supporting such 
peace treaties, we can help to 
halt militarization and human 
rights abuses, and make prog
ress towards true democracy. 
Bush, on the other hand, believes 
that the Nicaraguan and Soviet 
governments are the only aqtors 
in the region which must abide 
by the treaty. The Reagan/Bush 
administration has also been 
against the Arias peace plan and 
tried to thwart the Contadora 
plan, a proc
ess whichlead 
up to the 
Arias plan.
When Costa 
Rican Presi
dent Oscar 
Arias com
pleted the 
peace plan for 
which he won 
the Nobel 
peace prize, 
the Reagan administration pun
ished him by withholding mil
lions of dollars in aid which was 
promised his country. Currently 
Bush believes that pressure from 
the contras is away to get Sandin
istas to abide by the Arias plan.
In addition to pragmatic, stra
tegic and humanitarian reasons, 
Dukakis views on Nicaragua rest 
on legal grounds. Dukakis be
lieves that the Rio Treaty and 
the Charter of the Organization 
of American States, which our 
country helped to write forty 
years ago, explicitly make it ille
gal for our countiy to give aid to 
the contras. In 1986 the World 
Court also ordered the United 
States to stop usingits unlawful 
use of force against Nicaragua. 
Bush apparently doesnt think 
that these treaties have to be 
obeyed.
Both candidates support fos
tering economic and social devel
opment in Latin America. 
Dukakis maintains that Latin 
America is undergoing its worst 
economic crisis since World War
II. For example, the recession in 
Mexico has cost 200,000 US jobs, 
and the Latin American debt cri
sis has caused a forty percent de
cline in our exports to the region. 
Dukakis proposes that the next 
US President meet with Latin 
American leaders, international 
banks, commercial lenders and 
private voluntary organizations 
in order to: increase capital for 
lending institutions, ensure that
fense policy. For a long time he 
was a once-a-week consultant to 
Secretary of Defense and Hawk 
Casper Weinberger.
Critics who claim that Michael 
Dukakiss ideology is the dreaded 
L word arent completely familiar'with his positions. True, hes 
no conservative, but on issues 
like the military, there are many 
more liberal politicians than 
Dukakis.
And if you didnt do well on 
Thursdays DP test, take comfort 
in the fact t hat Boston Magazine 
named Allison one of the twelve 
most disagreeable men in Bos
ton.
Eric W. Leuliette is a con
tributing editor who took DP last 
fall. He still isnt quite sure what 
the difference between Models II 
and III is.
America
debt payments will not drain 
Latin American countries of their 
resources, mutually bring down 
trade barriers, and ensure that 
foreign aid is directed to areas 
where it will do the most good. 
Bush doesnt have any specific 
proposals for economic develop
ment, but thinks that the Mexi
can economy 
is doing well, 
and thinks 
that the only 
country with 
real economic 
problems is 
Cuba.
In general, 
both candi
dates see that 
there are 
some problems in the region, but 
differ on their analyses of the 
underlying causes and their pro
posed solutions. Both agree that 
violence and militarization are 
prevalent, but Bush thinks that 
it is only caused by Cuba, Nicara
gua and the Soviet Union. 
Dukakis believes that these are 
problems throughout Latin 
America, and thinks that the best 
ways to solve them are through 
negotiation, treaties and eco
nomic pressure. Both agree that 
there are economic problems, but 
again Bush only sees economic 
problems in 
Cuba, 
whereas 
Dukakis 
recognizes 
that we 
must use our 
vast eco
nomic re
sources to 
foster eco
nomic devel
opment in 
the entire region. I believe that 
although there are problems with 
both candidates positions, 
Dukakis represents a much more 
realistic, humane and construc
tive approach.

Lets face it folks, the Senate 
wasnt really hopping this week 
but it got me thinking about 
something thats missing from 
Senate and everywhere else on 
campus.
Theres a very simple rule that 
most people should follow, but 
dont. Its called KISS. No, I dont 
mean that you pucker up to every 
stray that comes along. It stands 
for a phrase: Keep It Simple, 
Stupid.
This months Carnegie Mellon 
Magazine attributes KISS to the 
Ringling Bros., Barnum and 
Bailey Circus Clown College. Its 
the school motto and it would be 
a good one for CMU.
It is most obvious when people 
are writing. Most people around 
here are afraid to write what they 
think. When they write a paper,
*7 dont favor abortion. I dont 
think its a good thing. I dont 
think most people do. The 
question is who makes the 
decision. And I think it has to 
be the woman in the exercise of 
her own conscience and reli
gious beliefs that makes that 
decision.
- Michael Dukakis, 
September 25th 
Presidential debate 
Michael Dukakis has once 
again side-stepped an impor
tant issue. Like many liberals, 
he is a master at masking real 
issues behind the veneer of 
freedom, fairness, and 
individual rights.
In order to make a decision 
about abortion, you must look 
behind this mask and into the 
womb. The issue of abortion is 
really not one of choice, but, 
rather, one of definitions. 
Should the fetus be defined as 
a person? Thats the real ques
tion that you must answer.
If you say no, then why not 
favor abortion? Why 
wouldnt it be a good thing? 
After all, an abortion does save 
an unwanting mother from 
nine months of pregnancy. 
Having an abortion, then, is 
no worse than having your 
appendix removed. Cut the 
unwanted tissue out and throw 
it in the garbage.
If, however, you say yes  
the fetus is a person  then 
the fetus must be protected 
like a person. That includes 
protection of its right to live. 
Consequently, abortion must 
be illegalized because it is 
murder.
Given the choice between writ
ing an extra research paper and 
being beaten about the head and 
shoulders with wet rolled-up 
newspapers, most CMU students 
would choose the newspapers. 
But the psychology department 
seems to think that offering a 
student the choice between being 
a guinea pig for research and 
writing a paper is not a form of 
coercion.
Please, dont insult our intelli
gence like that.
The alleged choice is there so 
that researchers can say that they 
are following ethics and the law 
in not forcing anyone to be a 
subject. However, when the price 
of not performing an act is raised 
high enough, the effect is the 
same as if the act were compul
sory. The price of not being a 
guinea pig is so high that stu
dents are coerced into being 
subjects for experiments.
This is unethical. If such a thing 
were to take place in medicine it 
would be called barbarism. Forc
ing people to take part in scien
tific experiments is something 
that went out with the Nazis, 
wasnt it? We have standards 
now. People cant be forced to be 
research subjects.
Unless, of course, theyre colDavid N. Levy
they try to fill the space that a 
professor wants. They dont tell 
the professor how they feel. Or 
else they spend all their time 
hiding the message to make sure 
that it never gets found.
If you spend too long doing this 
youll never get out of the habit. 
Break the chain and dont just 
try to fill the page. Write the way 
you speak, and remember KISS. 
We may just learn a few things 
besides reading, riting, and rithmatic before we get out of here.

Both positions cant be right. 
The fetus cannot be both a 
person and a non-person si
multaneously. The answer to 
this question, is the fetus a 
person, is either yes or no  
not maybe.
Consider these facts before 
you decide. The human em
bryo has a full set of human 
chromosomes upon concep
tion. In other words, its ge
netically human. Ithasaheart 
beat at 24 days  legally 
human. It has measurable 
brain waves at 43 days  i 
consciously human. All of its ; 
organs and systems are devel- i 
oped and operating at 56 days 
functionally human.
Alarmingly, babies occasion
ally survive the abortion pro
cedure. They do not, however, 
have to be allowed to live. 
Many times they are left to 
die. Because they are defined 
as non-persons, their lives are 
not protected.
No, Mr. Dukakis, the ques
tion is not who makes the 
decision. Thats a mask thats 
being used to cover pro-abor
tion attitudes. And an illogi
cal one at that.
The question is who makes 
the definition. By leaving that 
definition to the mother, mil
lions of mothers are errone
ously deciding to let their 
babies be killed.

lege students.
Maybe the researchers dont 
care about the ethical considera
tions. Maybe they feel that the 
end justifies the means, that if 
they did not force students to 
become guinea pigs, they would 
have no subjects.
Perhaps. But researchers dont 
seem to realize that their method 
of choosing subjects may invali
date much of their research. Most 
studies assume willing subjects. 
When papers are published, they 
mention that student volun
teers sign up for these experi
ments.
Most students arent willing 
subjects. They come to the ex
periment because the alternative 
is terribly costly, and they work 
through it as fast as possible just 
to get out, putting down random 
or incorrect answers. They are 
certainly not the willing volun
teers presupposed by experimen
tal protocols.
So there are practical as well 
as ethical reasons for research
ers to stop forcing students to be 
guinea pigs.
The argument that students 
should have the experience of 
being a subject in an experiment 
just doesnt hold water. What does 
the student get out of this? The 
experience is neutral, if not nega
tive. No active attempt is made 
to give the results of the study to 
the subject (being able to see the 
results at some unspecified lat
ter time is not going to help the 
student make sense of the expe
rience).
No, the only people getting 
anything are the researchers. If 
they need subjects so badly they 
had best find other ways to get 
them. Offer money or free food or 
appeal to the students curiosity, 
but requiring students to be 
experimental subjects must stop. 
It is simply not acceptable  at 
Carnegie Mellon or anywhere 
else.

AB puzzled by low turnout at dancesStudent laments grading 
scale in Swedlows courses
Editor:
Congratulations to Michael 
Drout for initiating the boat 
rocking with respect to prob
lems with certain types of 
grading systems. I would like 
to expand a bit upon this topic. 
I am a junior MechE/EPP 
student who took 2 courses 
from Professor J.L. Swedlow. 
Professor Swedlow responded 
to this topic of discussion re
cently. I thought Id explain 
what happened in Statics & 
Dynamics (SD) and Mechan
ics of Deformable Solids 
(MDS). In the beginning, these 
two classes (in which Profes
sor Swedlow taught a part of 
SD and all of MDS) were 
graded by what I considered to 
be a reasonable system. To
wards the end of both courses, 
I began to have serious prob
lems and complaints with the 
way my grades were being dis
tributed. The system used by 
Prof. Swedlow follows:
Class Score = Weight Factor 
1 (Total Points Earned/Total 
Points Possible)+ Weight Fac
tor 2 (Total Pts Earned/Total 
Pts Poss) + ...
There were from 2 to 5 areas 
that were weighted, and the 
weights were distributed as 
follows:
SD: 50%-Homework 50%-3 
Quizzes
MDS: 50%-Homework 20%- 
Exams & Quizzes 20%-Labs 
10%-Recitation
Prof. Swedlow said that 
usually a distribution of scores 
would form and noticeable 
groups of scores would develop. 
Between these groups one 
would be able to see obvious 
places to draw cut marks that 
would form the bounds for the 
different letter grades.
Seems okay, right? Well, all 
I knew going in was the weight
ing system and that things 
would be curved. However, no 
one knew what range of scores 
could be equated to on the 
grading system were all used 
to, i.e. ABCDR. I recall asking 
a question in SD related to 
this topic and was told by 
Professor Swedlow that things 
would be much like the Dy
namics Section of the course 
taught by another professor. That 
system was as follows:
80+
70-80
60-70
50-60
<50
A
B
C
D
R
At the end of the SD course, I 
had an 86.69 score. I felt I had a 
pretty solid B. The scale used to 
convert this score to a letter grade 
was as follows:
99 upA+ 85 - 87 C97 - 99A 84.5 - 85D+
96 - 97A- 80 - 84.5D
94 - 96B+ 77 - 80 D92 - 94B 73 - 77 R+
91 - 92B- 50 - 73 R
88.5 - 91C+ 50 downR87 - 88.5C
I apologize for any slight errors 
I have made in communicating 
this scale.
Seems to me that this scale is 
not something that most students 
at any university would be used 
to or happy with. Notice that to 
get an A, a student would have to 
get a 96 or higher. A couple of 
simple math errors on homeworks could insure against that. 
I was always told that homework 
was the time to learn from your 
mistakes, not be punished for 
them. Furthermore, a D for the 
course could be the result of not 
understanding one problem on 
one of the exams given.
Most of the class did very well 
in the 2nd half of SD; however, 
none of us realized that everyone 
doing well would result in all of 
us being categorized as average 
or satisfactory as Prof. Swedlow 
declares. A big problem was that 
no one really knew how they were 
doing until the end of the course. 
This fact holds true for both SD 
and MDS. The only one who had 
the ability to calculate the classes 
scores and look at the distribu
tion was Professor Swedlow. He 
failed to do this on his own, and 
when asked to do so he replied, 
Those sorts of calculations take 
too much time to perform. Well, 
in the age of spreadsheet pro
grams, I believe his complex cal
culations and the graph of the 
resulting score distribution could 
have been cooked up in. 15 min
utes. I fail to see the complexity
in this.
Knowing periodically how we 
were doing in these courses 
would still not have solved a 
bigger problem of receiving a 
C for a score of 90. Although 
this isnt a percent, everyone 
has to admit that if you com
plete 9 out of 10 questions on 
every lab, quiz, homework, and 
exam, you will have completed
90 percent of the total pos
sible.
I decided to argue my grade 
in SD and in MDS because I 
thought this system, forcing 
the distribution of scores over
4 or 5 possible ranges no mat
ter what the actual scores were, 
was absolute rubbish. I met 
repeatedly with Professor 
Swedlow, both alone and with 
Professor Sinclair, the MechE 
Department Head. I also tried 
fellow MechE students. The 
result of all this was much 
hand waving and few results. 
The one thing that did result 
was that the Department Head 
told Professor Swedlow that 
he should develop a scale to 
which students could compare 
themselves to. This would al
leviate the problem of not 
knowing how you were doing 
throughout the course.
To sum up the many points 
brought out above, I can only 
say that this implementation 
of the curved grading scale is 
completely unfair and unjusti
fied. Penalizing students for 
minor  not major concep
tual mistakes to the point of 
destroying their QPAs is to
tally unnecessary. I would like 
to see some sort of change; 
however, professors with ten
ure seem to pull more weight 
than I.
I know I am not the only one 
who feels strongly about this 
issue. I hear many whimpers 
out in the darkness. Yet no one 
wants to stand up and 
SCREAM. When will these 
students and professors stamp 
out this unjustifiable wrong
doing? Feel free to contact me 
via Box 766, Donner, x4084.
Please keep in mind that this 
is not a personal attack on 
anyone or group of people at 
this University.

AB Dance thanks you for your 
generous support in the first three 
issues.
We regret you chose to run such 
a negative headline in your post 
coverage of the Fins and Flippers 
dance.
We did not consider the Fins 
and Flippers dance a flop. For us, 
attendance is not the only meas. ure of success. AB Dance judges 
; success by standards which in
clude providing a smoothly run 
. event with good music and at
mosphere, our ability to improve 
on previous dances, and whether
 attendees are enjoying them
selves. We have to rely on creat
ing fun, a challenging objective 
for a campus like Carnegie Mel
lon where leisure time is at such 
premium.
AB Dance scheduled four great 
dances this semester. Two have 
already taken place. The response 
from those who attended has been 
overwhelmingly positive. The 
bands have been great, the rooms 
have had atmosphere. The only 
thing missing has been a large 
crowd.

I recently visited an arms fac
tory where George Bush was 
expected later in the day. Does 
this plant make firearms? I 
asked Bushs advance man.
No, he said. It produces arms 
that you can place across your 
chest when youre reciting the 
Pledge of Allegiance to the flag. 
Its the largest right-arm factory 
in the world, and business is 
booming since the candidate 
made the flag the main issue of 
his campaign.
Are they meant for people who 
dont have right arms? I asked.
No, these are for citizens who 
have their own arms. The manu
factured arm makes it possible to 
recite the Pledge and applaud 
. Bush at the same time.
Its a miracle,  I exclaimed. 
Before Reagan, Americans 
didnt care if they had an arm to 
pledge with or not. But the Re
publicans changed all that, and 
the demand for a right arm to put 
over your heart has swept the 
nation. Theyre not very expen
sive. They sell for $9.95 each. 
Does Bush own any of these? 
Of course. If you say the Pledge 
; of Allegiance as often as he does, 
you have to keep a trunkload for 
emergencies. Theyre going to

Come see what youve been miss
ing!
The purpose of AB Dance as a 
campus wide organization is to 
provide a wide variety of high 
quality Dance events for the 
campus community. We have no 
direct control over the size of the 
audience at any particular event. 
All we can do is ensure that the 
campus is aware when an event 
is to take place. We have no 
method to make attendance, nor 
should we. No dance can appeal 
to all members of the commu
nity, but the overall program for 
a year should do everything pos
sible to try. In bringing Blues, 
Motown, new Wave, Bluegrass/ 
Country, Classic rock, Top 40, 
Swing, and reggae music to the 
campus in the past two semes
ters we feel we have had a wide 
variety of music at AB events. 
The AB Publicity committee has 
informed the campus of our 
events through posters, banners 
and advertisements in The TarArt Buchwald
give him a Teflon-coated one at 
todays ceremonies. Its supposed 
to be very special because not 
only can you place it across your 
chest ot salute the flag, but it can 
also be held up in a V for Victory 
sign when youre taking a bow. 
What does George do with his 
real right arm?
During his speech he uses it to 
point out Dukakis mistakes and 
to question the governors patri
otism.
And when he has his arm 
across his chest?
Almost certainly its a plastic 
one made in this factory.
How did you discover such an 
operation?
The owner called us. He sent a 
sample to the Vice President as 
soon as he heard that George had 
a bad case of tennis elbow caused 
by placing his hand on his heart 
while reciting the Pledge. The 
VP was really impressed and told 
me to check it out. What made it 
exciting to us was that Michael 
Dukakis had never been here. It 
seemed the perfect spot for a foltan.
We are perplexed by the lack of 
general campus response to fall 
events so far but would like to 
thank those organizations and 
individuals who have been espe
cially supportive of our dances to 
date. AB Dance is open to any 
input from the campus commu
nity. Our fall events have been 
planned to respond to the over
whelmingly positive feedback we 
received in a survey of random 
students last spring.
AB Dance hopes to have sup
port from other campus organi
zations in the dances remaining 
this school year. We look forward 
to joining SDC, Senate and the 
Athletic Department in planning 
Hoopla 88. We look forward to 
working with SARC, Alumni 
Relations and members of the 
Greek System in planning the 
Homecoming dance with the 
Flow. We also look forward to 
planning this semesters Big 
Band Bash with the Tommy 
Dorsey Orchestra during Fresh
man parents weekend and an
other varied semester of events 
in the spring.

not to blame 
for everything
Editor:
I am writing in response to 
your letter recently published 
entitled IM Football: An acci
dent waiting to happen. [Sep
tember 27] While I believe this 
article does have some valid 
points, I would like to address 
the issue which puts the IM Di
rector at fault.
First, I am the injured player 
that was lying on the ground. I 
was not very conscious of the 
time factor, but when I looked up 
the IM Director was standing over 
me advising me to lie still. More
over, the next morning, the IM 
Director was asked to come see 
how I was. Mr. Birdy stopped 
over that same Friday to see me. 
I know the IM Director person
ally, and I know he would do 
everything possible to help me or 
anyone else, as quickly as he 
could. I would also like to state 
that it was the IM Director who 
placed the call to the CMU Po
lice.
I would like to see some changes 
in response time, not only by the 
CMU Police but by the Paramed
ics. But these are situations 
which are not under the IM 
Directors control.

low-up to Georges visit to the 
flag factory in New Jersey. 
That was good thinking. Youll 
probably be on all three networks 
tonight.
We hope so, but that isnt why 
George is coming over.
Why is he coming?
Its his way of showing that he 
cares about this country, and that 
he admires any company that 
makes it easier for Americans to 
recite the Pledge. Many people 
complain about how hard it is to 
put their arms across their chests. 
With these arms they have no 
excuse.
How long are they good for? 
Twenty days if you keep them 
in a dry place.
Can I use the arms to wave to 
George after he makes a speech? 
Yes, we waved them at the 
convention in New Orleans when 
Dan Quayle was nominated and 
they worked like a dream. 
What time does todays cere
mony begin?
Any minute now. We can start 
as soon as theyve measured the 
VP for a flag to wrap himself in 
when he leads us all in reciting 
the oath.

Last night I saw a brand new 
campaign commercial telling us 
(the American public, that is) 
what America needs. This time it 
was the Bush campaign espous
ing Experienced Leadership for 
America. Imagine my surprise! 
A Bush commercial which actu
ally tells us to vote for Mike 
Dukakis!
Dukakis has an undeniable rec
ord as an expe
rienced leader.
He has served 
as Massachu
setts governor 
for ten years.
Prior to being 
governor,
Dukakis 
served in the State House of Rep
resentatives and as a leading 
public advocate, fighting for the 
people of Massachusetts. As a 
young political leader, Dukakis 
was responsible for introducing 
and leading the fight for no-fault 
auto insurance as a solution to 
massive rate increases, a plan 
which has since been duplicated 
around the US.
As governor during his first 
term, Dukakis had the unfortu
nate duty of saving his state from 
deep economic trouble that the 
Republican leadership had left it 
in. Massachusetts had the sec
ond highest unemployment rate 
and a record state deficit. He was 
removed from the Governors 
office in 1978 and returned again 
in 1982. During his four year 
absence, he was appointed to the 
faculty of Kennedy School of
Chuck Jainchill
Government at Harvard Univer
sity where he taught and learned 
more effective governing tech
niques.
In 1982, after four years of irre
sponsible leadership, Dukakis 
returned 
to the 
Governors 
office. He 
returned 
integrity 
to the 
state gov
ernment 
and rescued the budget from a 
potential deficit, turning it into a 
substantial surplus. Dukakis also 
cut taxes five times including the 
largest tax cut in Massachusetts 
history. He led Massachusetts to 
the lowest unemployment rate of 
any industrial state in America. 
In 1986 Dukakis was named the 
most effective governor in Amer
ica by the nations governors, both 
Democrat and Republican.
What about George? Where was 
George? George Bush served in a 
variety of appointed federal 
goverment positions including 
Director of the CIA. He has obvi
ously also filled the glamorous 
position of Vice President of the 
United States. During his tenure 
with Federal Government he has 
been on the scene during most of 
the fun filled fiascos of the last 
twenty years, from Watergate to
the more recent Iran-Contra af
fair and the Adminstrations 
dealings with Panamanian 
leader Noriega.
Looking over the policies of the 
Reagan administration which led 
to the Iran-Contra dealings, Bush 
has readily admitted he was out 
of the loop when decisions were 
made. While he was in the loop" 
for all information sessions and 
was placed in charge of the 
Presidents committee on terror
ism , his opinions were not asked 
for. Looking at the wider picture 
this should not be surprising. 
Mother Jones magazine reported 
that Bush, as Director of the CIA 
for the last year of the Ford 
administration, was not always 
consulted on major decision 
making within the CIA. He was a 
public relations man with Con
gress and he was out of the loop. 
While serving the Ford admini
stration in China he only met 
with Chairman Mao once, and 
that was while Secretary of State 
Kissenger was visiting. He was 
out of the loop in China as well.
The George Bush experience 
can be defined as in the loop 
when information is dispensed, 
but out of the loop when leader
ship decisions are made. As Presi
dent, can we afford to have Bush 
out of the loop on major policy 
decisions? Is this the Experi
enced Leadership for America 
we really want? You can make 
your choice known by voting on 
November 8th.

Collopy said that the University is 
in the process of installing emer
gency lights in Mellon Institute. 
However he said that the fact that 
the project has not been completed 
yet did not cause problems during 
Wednesdays power loss. Residents 
of Mellon Institute agreed that the 
blackout was handled well and led 
to a minimum of inconvenience.
Associate Head of Biology Eric 
Grotzinger, whose office is in Mellon

. concedes, CFA was too spread 
out across campus.
The renovation project will 
cost $3.5 million. The cost is 
high because, along with reno
vating the classrooms, the 
University must bring the 
building up to proper safety 
codes.
According to Senior Illustra
tion major Susan Marchl, the 
construction is a distraction to 
classes.
Senior English major 
Christine Begley said, I do 
not like the construction. It
makes it difficult to walk 
through MM.
Midani is trying to re
duce construction noise 
during class time, but it can 
not be stopped entirely.
Midani is moving depart
ments gradually into Mar
garet Morrison to reduce 
congestion in the building 
during construction. By the 
Fall of 1989 the transition 
will be completed.
With the addition of MM, 
Midani said to Never look 
backwards, always to the 
future.

ties have in their whole system.
Campana indicated that the 
present plan is to have a meeting 
among himself, Visconti, Pace, 
and Mike Franc (CFP president) 
some time next week. Visconti 
said that the sororities hope a 
decision can be reached, and the 
situation resolved by mid-Oct.
Visconti said further, I think it 
will be a positive step for the
Greek system as a whole. 
When asked about the proba
bility of the changes being imple
mented, Campana said, Its too 
early to tell, but added that he 
has talked in an unofficial capac
ity with a lot of people in the 
fraternities and they seem to 
think its very reasonable and 
are very supportive of it. Now 
what we have to do is make sure 
were not missing anything, and
that we cover all the bases and 
hopefully, we can put together a 
system that works and will be 
fair to everybody.
Campana went on to say that 
he plans to play an active role in 
expediting the process as quickly 
as possible, stating, Im work
ing quickly on this...We have to 
make a determination as to what 
is our best move. Something like 
this you dont drag your feet on.

Memories of Me with Billy Crystal. King, 
61, has been seen onstage in Pittsburgh 
often, most recently on September 24th 
Jo/ Duquesne U. During that recent visit 
he spoke with Tartan Diversions Editor 
Michael Rose about 
Memories of Me and 
about his forty years in 
show business.
Mr King, welcome to 
Pittsburgh.
Thank you.
Youre here on a pro

Well, Im actually 
doing a concert tonight 
at Duquesne University; 
so it just worked out fine 
except that its Satur

a story about relation

son - its about a son 
that grew up too fast and

12The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  4 October 1988
Busy weeks coming in 
Pittsburgh classical
By CHRIS FECTEAU
Tartan Staffwriter
This weekends concerts by 
the Pittsburgh Symphony were 
led by guest conductor Yoel Levi 
and featured Boris Belkin as 
solo violinist. A relatively ob
scure work by Paul Hindemith 
opened the concert, namely his 
Nobilissima visione. Made up 
.of exu'.t r a c t s 
from an 
earlier 
4331161 
on the 
'life of 
S t .
..Francis of Assisi, the work 
attempts to evoke the flavor of 
. the thirteenth century setting. 
Levi found a convincing com
promise between medieval 
ideas and their twentieth cen
tury compositional treatment 
_but the piece itself is not an ex
tremely exciting one. The work 
heavily favors the strings of 
the orchestra and this perform
ance was notable for the excel
lent sound that Levi was able 
to get from that section.
The definite highlight of the 
concert Friday night, however, 
was the Glazunov Concerto in 
A minor. Boris Belkin, the 
violin soloist, displayed not only 
wonderful technique and a 
beautiful sound, but also a 
great sense of the musical style 
of the piece, a real romp in 
Russian nationalism. Conduc
tor Levi and the orchestra 
provided sensitive accompani
ment to Belkin who received 
three extra curtain calls from 
an enthusiastic audience.
Less successful was the 
Saint-Sans Symphony No. 3 
(Organ). In trying to force a 
tempo slightly slower than the 
one usually taken, Levi not only 
eliminated the works sense of 
urgency, but also caused en
semble problems that would 
not otherwise have occurred. 
Levi does however deserve a 
good amount of credit for his 
excellent balancing of orches
tral textures, especially in the 
sections with organ.
In several respects, this con
cert far surpassed last weeks 
performance by Levi and the 
orchestra. The conductor had 
much better contact with the 
orchestra and the fact that he 
seemed to enjoy this program 
much more than the last also 
transferred well to the audi
ence.
Next weeks concerts by the 
symphony (Thursday at 8, Fri
day at 8:30 and Sunday at 2:30) 
feature Polish composer and 
conductor Krzystof Penderecki 
conducting a program that 
includes his own Symphony 
No. 2. Also to be performed are
with Chris Fecteau
Sibelius popular tone poem 
Finlandia and the 
Schostakovich Violin Concerto 
No. 2, with Victor Tretyakov 
as soloist. PSO Assistant Con
ductor Stephen Lano will talk 
with Penderecki in the free 
Pre-Concert Conversations 
one hour before each of the 
concerts. The Heinz Hall Box 
Office number is 392-4900.
The 
next two 
weeks 
are busy 
ones in 
Pitts
burgh 
classical 
music. The Pittsburgh Opera 
will present Giuseppi Verdis 
masterpiece Aida at the 
Benedum Center on Tuesday, 
Friday and Sunday (October 
4, 7 and 9). The production is 
an exciting one including 
horses and, yes believe it, a 
real live elephant. (Watch the 
dancers do some really special 
footwork!) For more informa
tion call the Benedum Box 
Office at 456-6666.
The Mendelssohn Choir of 
Pittsburgh will present a con
cert of popular American mu
sic Sunday, October 9 at 8 in 
Carnegie Music Hall, Oakland. 
The 150 singers directed by 
Robert Page will perform songs 
of Cole Porter, Duke Ellington 
and Irving Berlin in a program 
entitled Ballads, Blues and 
J.azz. For tickets or more in
formation call 32-SOUND 
(327-6863).
Eunice Norton will play the 
third and fourth of seven con
certs encompassing all 32 
Beethoven piano sonatas this 
and next Sunday in the Frick 
Fine Arts Auditorium in 
Oakland. The concerts begin 
at 4 p.m. but the first two in 
the series played to full houses, 
so arrive a little early.
The Y Music Society will 
present soprano Erie Mills in 
recital Sunday October 16 at 8 
in the Morris Kaufmann Audi
torium, 315 S. Bellefield Ave., 
Oakland. This is the first in 
the Ys recital series that in
cludes a concert by Andre 
Watts in December. For ticket 
information call 521-8010.
The Contemporary En
semble of Carnegie Mellons 
Music Department will per
form works of Berio and Villa 
Lobos on a convocation pro
gram Thursday the 6th at 
12:30. Jon Mitchell will direct 
the Wind Ensemble in a con
cert Tuesday the 11th at 8 
including three fanfares by 
Wagner as well as works by 
Copland, Weill and others. 
Both of these programs are 
free and take place in Alumni 
Concert Hall, CFA.
Dance Council premieres 
Nat. Performance Network
This month at the Pittsburgh Playhouse...
By DAWN BROSONSKI
Tartan Staffwriter
An Amnesia, the newest work 
of the Stephen Petronio Com
pany, will be presented by The 
Pittsburgh Dance Council Octo
ber 7 - 9 at the Stephen Foster 
Theatre in Oakland. It is the 
Councils first production since 
receiving the honor of being in
cluded in the National Perform
ance Network. This network en
ables the Pittsburgh Dance Coun
cil to bring to the public some of 
the finest, most innovative dance 
works of late.
Steven Petronio was formerly 
a member of renowned dancer 
Trisha Browns company and 
later began choreographing his 
own works. In 1984, he formed 
his own company which received 
rave reviews in the United States 
and Europe. The San Francisco 
Chronicles Marilyn Tucker de
scribed Petronios choreography 
as laced with dramatic incident... 
and an explosive, high energy 
movement.
Wings of angels on the streets of Berlin
By DAVID LEVY
Tartan Contributing Editor
There are angels on the streets 
of Berlin. They cannot touch, 
they cannot speak. They can see, 
but not in colors. They can bring 
you back from the edge of de
spair. They can sit in on your 
thoughts. They observe all, but 
are denied experience.
Welcome to Wings of Desire, a 
film directed by Wim Wenders 
(pronounced Vim Venders). We 
are allowed to follow two angels 
as they walk/fly/move around the 
city of Berlin.
At first this is confusing, espe
cially because the film is sub
titled, and we usually hear a 
different language and then read 
what was said. We visit many 
different places in succession, and 
the rapid segues can be disori
enting. The segues themselves 
are filled with beautiful black 
and white shots of Berlin.
We move into different peoples 
lives, catching only short 
glimpses. We soon get a feel for 
what it is like to be an angel, 
always observing and then mov
ing on. To connect these snippets 
of life together we hear/see a 
stanza of poetry that always has 
the same first line, when the 
child was a child. The poetry 
seems to be gently reminding us 
of growing up. As we go from 
child to adult, things change, but 
many of the curiosities of life 
still remain.
The films main plotline in
volves the angel Damiels deci
sion to become less than heav
enly after he falls in love with 
Marion. Marion is a lonely tra
peze artist whose life in the cir
cus is about to end. Damiels 
yearning to be human increases 
as the movie goes on. Will he 
choose to be human or remain 
the observer?
His partner, Cassiel, also has a 
particular human, Homer, that 
he is interested in, but not in the 
same way as Damiel. An old man,
photo courtesy Orion Picture
An Introspective moment over the streets of Berlin in Wim Wenders Wings of Desire.
Homer provides us with memo
ries of a Berlin that has passed 
away.
Homer calls himself a story 
teller. At first he spoke the words 
aloud, but as time passed he wrote 
them down instead. Homer walks 
through the ruins of old Berlin, 
speaking of the city as a place of 
picturesque cafs and boutiques, 
more like Old Paris than post
war Germany.
The last plot thread involves 
American actor Peter Falk. Hes 
on location in Berlin for a movie 
about the Nazi regime. At times 
he even talks to the angels that 
he feels are watching him. Each 
element of the plot is kept to
gether by Damiels interactions 
and wanderings.
The poetry of the movie can 
make it very deep. At the same 
time, you can take it at face value
and enjoy some of the best blac 
and white cinematography 
recent years. There are color seg 
ments when the angels leave th 
scene and the people are left alon 
with only us as observers.
All in all the film is very we 
done and merits a visit by al 
Exclusively at the Pittsburg 
Playhouse through October 27tl 
Go, enjoy, and dont forget yoi 
popcorn.
How to mate a hit

Dinosaurs and radon: A connection?
Many of you have questions 
about radon. Please let me ex
plain.
Billions of years ago a dinosaur 
died under your house. The title 
company didnt tell you this. Now 
the dinosaur looks real icky. Hes 
got fumes coming out of his nose 
and slithering up underneath the 
swing set in the backyard. These 
fumes have the same stuff in em 
we used to blow up Hiroshima. If 
you breathe this stuff every day 
while youre watching Family 
Feud, your lung will 
eventually look like a 
kickball thats been 
mashed flat under a 
Demster Dumpster.
Youll know this when 
people come in your 
house and say, Hey,      
sounds like you got 30,40 cobras 
under that sofa. Oh, sorry, its 
just Sal, breathing again.
Fortunately, we have a govern
ment agency called the EPA that 
gives us all the information on 
this stuff. Heres the information 
they gave us:
1. Where is it? Everywhere.
2. Whose house is it in? We 
dont know.
3. Can we get rid of it? No.
4. Can we keep it out of the 
house? Maybe.
5. What is going to happen to 
us? You will die.
6. Is that all? No, smokers will 
die faster.
So then they send out this 
pamphlet in the mail, how they 
surveyed 11,000 homes and about 
I 3,500 of em had four picocuries 
of radon per liter of air, and all 
the people in North Dakota will 
be dead by next year. Except for 
the people in North Dakota, who 
just said Shoot, we aint even 
gonna try, everybody else in the 
country started asking how soon 
they were gonna die and whether 
they should fumigate, and if they 
dont fumigate, whether theyll 
have babies bom with 12 hands.
And then the EPA said you 
send off 20 bucks for this little 
radon roach motel that collects 
the stuff, and then you send it off
to Fotomat or somewhere, and 
they write you a letter that says, 
Yes, you are going to die, or 
Nope  you just put 20 bucks 
down the toilet. And then if you 
get the letter saying youre going 
to die, they give you instructions 
on how to hire some guy named 
Jake who drives a Nissan pickup 
with tools in the back and comes 
to your house wearing a gas mask 
and carrying a blowtorch. Jake 
will only charge you a couple thou 
to run a pipeline up out of your
To The Drive-In
basement to the roof and stick in 
a fan that blows gunk into the 
atomosphere where it belongs. 
And then, before he leaves, hell 
say, Hope we got her. Gimme a 
call if the baby dont grow some 
feet pretty soon.
Oh yeah, one more thing. Its 
invisible. Its odorless. The little 
roach motel might work and it 
might not. And Jake got his de
gree in air conditioner repair from 
Southeast Oklahoma State 
Teachers College.
Free consumer tip from Joe Bob 
just thought you should know.
Speaking of home repairs, 
Twice Dead is about a mansion 
in El Lay thats haunted by a 
movie camera. Just when you 
think youre safe in bed, this 
terrifying camera bobs and 
weaves down the hall, so you 
cant see exactly where youre 
going, and then  wham!  it 
races to a close-up of some help
less TV actor trapped in a movie 
about sleazeball gangs that want 
to kill an entire family for 
HUMILIATING them with spe
cial effects.
Actually, this is one of the best 
flicks of 88, the drive-in version 
of Sunset Boulevard. It starts 
with a creepozoid film star danc
ing around his mansion with a 
female department store dummy,

nightclubs again. He had a couple 
of movies that were not success
ful but he continued to grow and 
of course when the Cosby show 
came along, he was ready.
But youve never had that expe
rience of being discovered ?
Nope, never been discovered. 
Im a survivor. I figure, if you 
hang around long enough, they 
cant avoid you.
For young performers, such as 
people coming out of CMUDrama 
[what wouldyou say to them?].. .A 
lot of people have come out of 
here, Albert Brooks for example.
Yes, and Albert particularly 
comes from a long line of show 
business, you talk about tradi
tion. I knew his father very well. 
You dont have to come out of a 
show business tradition. I dont 
know if it helps, actually. Al
though we have this new pack 
now, this sons of sons of sons. Its 
the Bridges, and the Sheens... 
which is terrific!
But I think that... well, when I 
was growing up there didnt seem 
to be a need for formal education. 
But as I got older I realized that 
the more knowledge I obtained, 
or acquired, the better my work 
became. Comedy is basically a 
reportage, its a report, and the 
more you know, the better your 
work is. Its not just standing up 
on the stage and screaming and 
making funny faces, not for a 
talking comedian. So knowledge 
becomes very important, and 
observation, and I think knowl
edgeable people are observers. 
Thats how you gain knowledge - 
you just dont read it out of a 
book. It all helps. I think thats 
very important to comedy, im
portant to drama. To under
stand... knowledge is an incred
ible thing.
If there was one piece of advice 
you could give to up-and-coming 
performers, people who wanted 
to break into the business, what 
would it be?
stabbing her with a steak knife, 
and then hanging himself from 
the rafters cause theyre about to 
take his house away. Fifty years 
later, the Ozzie-and-Harriet 
family from Boulder shows up, 
runs off a Cro-Magnon biker gang 
with a shotgun, wipes away some 
cobwebs, and starts moving in. 
The only thing is, nobodys 
changed any of the furniture for 
50 years. The dead film star is 
still ghostin around up there, 
coasting down the halls disguised 
as a camera, wrapping 
ropes around juniors 
ankles while hes sleep
ing, peeking at the 
daughter, and, in the 
big final scene, Jasoning to death four or five 
gang goonies for mash
ing up his dummy with a motor
cycle. You dont know whether 
hes a good ghost or a bad ghost, 
or why he carries a 35-millimeter 
camera with him everywhere he 
goes, but thats what makes it 
GREAT.

Party on the court
By STEWART LEVINE
Tartan Contributing Editor
This is CMTJs chance to 
party.
Thats quite a heady state
ment from Rob Bowie, Special 
Assistant to the Vice Presi
dent of Enrollment. Bowie is 
referring to Hoopla 88, a com
bination dance party/basket
ball practice scheduled for 
October 14 in the Gym.
October 15 is the first day 
basketball teams are allowed 
to practice by the NCAA. Some 
universities have started the 
practice of having a midnight 
practice for the fans and the 
press. At a few places, like the 
University of Kentucky and 
now Carnegie Mellon, theyre 
taking this idea a little bit fiirther.
The goal ofHoopla is to bring 
more people into the Gymna
sium for the unveiling of the 
1988 basketball Tartans. The 
evening will start off with a 
dance featuring local dance 
group Modem Man. As the 
hour approaches midnight, the 
mens and womens basketball 
teams will be introduced and 
hold a brief scrimmage.
The event is part of the ef
fort to support the teams. 
Exposure is what [we] need, 
said Bowie. Footballs got the 
cut. People dont know whats 
going on [in basketball].
The program begins at 9:30 
in the Gym. Its the start of a 
new annual eventevery Oct. 
14th. Itll be like Carnival, 
asserts Bowie.

matic, but I think it has to be a 
calling. Its almost like the cross, 
like the church. Youve got to 
want to do it, against all odds. 
Youve got to want to do it. Its not 
just Today I am a comedian, 
you know, and if you dont make 
it in a year you go into your 
fathers shoe business. No, youve 
got to be able to [do it], and there 
are no shortcuts, and there is no 
list of how to. Richard Belzer just 
wrote a book called How to be a 
Stand-Up Comedian, and I read 
it and learned nothing, although 
I like Richard. You cant get it 
that way.
I think the only advice is its 
got to be a drive. Its got to be 
such a desire that youre willing 
to give up an awful lot to do it, to 
accomplish. And then it doesnt 
happen, most of the time it 
doesnt. But the single piece of 
advice is to keep working, at any 
price, anywhere. I was once told, 
when I was a kid, that you never 
get discovered laying off, and you 
never get better laying off. So 
youve got to ply your trade, youve 
got to keep at it, keep working all 
the time. You fall down, youre 
bad - you get up and you do it 
again. Youve got to keep doing it, 
and hopefully you get better.
What do you enjoy most about 
being an entertainer?
You get the best table in a res
taurant, you can get into a hotel 
when its sold out.. .but thats kind 
of facetious; I think I like the 
recognition, because of my child
hood and growing up as I did. The 
recognition, whether it be visual 
or artistically.
There are drawbacks of being a 
public person, but I find it very 
comfortable. I dont find any 
problem with it at all.

swer is Lina Hoshino, Marcela 
Silva, Hannah Welsh, and 
Daniele Wilmouth, who will show 
their work this week at the Forbes 
Gallery. Featured will be pieces 
in conventional media, such as 
pencil and oil paint, as well as 
some unconventional works of 
art, including a video installaviewer closer to discover what 
the image is, and maybe how it 
was achieved. One of Marcelas 
prints shows the view from her 
seat at a Pat Metheny concert 
last year. She took her metal plate

an image, and from which the 
print is later made) to the concert 
and scratched in the image on

Marcela will show some of her

rebellion in Chile, of personal 
significance to her, since she is 
Chilean. One of the drawings 
depicts pots and pans, which are 
what Chileans make noise with

Back and forth with the 
closed/open Foundry
By DAN BIDWA
Tartan Staffwriter
And, once again, the Foundry 
is closed. A tragic thing - the per
mits were in sight, along with the 
brand new parking lot, and 
Scrawl was trucking in from 
Columbus to herald the glorious 
reopening, but it was not to be. 
This time it was a building in
spector, who went into the club 
and started giggling. The inspective camage was probably pretty 
enormous, but none can say, not 
even the 
owner, who 
was told to 
wait for the 
written re
port. Re
gardless, the 
Scrawl show 
was once 
again post
poned, as 
well as all
upcoming shows at the Foundry 
until the city has had its archi
tectural say. Stay tuned for fur
ther developments.
The Graffiti is still open, of 
course, and next Thursday they 
will be hosting the Jamaica Re
lief Benefit. The proceeds from 
the show will help out the people 
in Jamaica who got whomped by 
Hurricane Gilbert. (Imagine the 
ignominy of being whomped by a 
hurricane named Gilbert.) The 
show includes five reggae bands, 
with Delroy Williams, Sister 
Buriny, and Chill Factor as the 
ones that get mentioned here.
Has anyone seen the commer
cials for the upcoming U2 movie, 
called, eloquently enough, Rattle 
and Hum? Did anyone even 
realize that there was such a 
beast as a U2 movie? Anyway, 
the commercials are playing the

Proceeds will go to Mobilization 
for Animals, an organization that 
helps abused animals. 
Lina will also show some of her 
brightly colored paintings, exe
cuted in acrylics. Some seem to 
have a vague reference to plants 
or animals, although the enig
matic imagery that she paints 
can be interpreted in endless 
ways, something that Lina en
joys about abstract painting.
Daniele has made a video of 
her grandmother that will be 
shown in a re-created roomofher 
grandmothers  complete with 
wallpaper. Other artifacts from 
her grandparents, including ob
jects made by her grandfather, 
will be displayed separately. 
Danieles mixed-media presen
tation creates an interesting 
diversion in the show, especially 
for those who are intimidated by 
large paintings or tiny intaglio 
prints.
So if youre in to Pat Metheny,

Cuarteto performs tonight at Mellon
By CHRIS FECTEAU
Tartan Staffwriter
Tonight at the Mellon Insti
tute Auditorium will be the 
first in the series of four con
certs by the Cuarteto Lati
noamericano, Artists in Resi
dence in the Carnegie Mellon 
Music Department. The quar
tet, made up of brothers Saul 
and Aron Bitran, violins and 
Alvaro Bitran, cello, as well 
as violist Javier Montiel, has 
a special interest in works by 
Latin American composers but 
performs a great variety of 
music covering the entire spec
trum of the literature. 
Tonights concert program 
includes a work by Silvestre 
Revueltas entitled Msica de 
Feria (Music of the Fair), in 
which can be heard Mexican 
popular tunes and other 
noises of the fair. An un
usual early work by Alban 
Berg in the late Romantic style 
(Langsamer Satz) and the 
Bartk Quartet No. 3 round 
out the twentieth century 
works on the program. (That 
the quartet particularly likes 
to program contemporary 
pieces is evident by this years
concert program as just over half 
the works are from the twentieth 
century.) Mozarts Quartet No.
1, also known as the Cello Quar
tet, is also on the program. The 
quartet members say that the 
classical repertoire is the most 
difficult to play very well but also 
note that not eveiyone can play 
the contemporary literature that 
is so special to them.
The Cuarteto Latinoamericano 
originated in 1981 in Mexico City 
when Aron and Alvaro Bitran 
and Javier Montiel were playing 
as pricipals in some of the profes
sional orchestras in the city. At 
first the ensemble was a parttime venture whenever they 
could find rehearsal time, but 
eventually they found it neces
sary to give up the security of 
orchestra jobs to devote more 
energy to the ensemble. 
Younger brother Saul is the 
newest member of the en
semble and replaced another 
violinist. This is their second 
year at Carnegie Mellon and 
they are grateful for the op
portunity that the university 
affiliation provides. For the 
wonderful musicianship they 
bring to Pittsburgh from their 
native Mexico, Carnegie Mel
lon should be even more grate
ful to them.
Tonights free concert takes 
place at 8 p.m. in the Mellon 
Institute Auditorium. Mellon 
Institute is at 4400 Fifth Ave. 
in Oakland.

quirky shapes similar to those in 
Linas paintings, ' although 
Hannahs tend to have more 
defined edges and flatter inter
locking planes, as opposed to 
Linas, whose abstract shapes 
create a deeper space. A few of 
Hannahs paintings use the paint 
not only to depict imagery, but as 
a textural element as well, 
whereas her others tend to have 
a smooth surface. Hannah sees 
the finished work in her show as 
a starting point. As many artists 
do, she will see where her future 
work leads, and follow if she likes 
it.

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon * 4 October 198815
Filmmakers is media resource
py PETER ALBERT
Tartan Staffwriter
The month of October is filled with a number of 
unique and educational events sponsored by Pitts
burgh Filmmakers. For those of you who are not 
familiar with it, Pittsburgh Filmmakers is a non
profit organization dedicated to the development 
the media arts in the community. They sponsor 
films, film festivals, photography exhibits, college 
2/credit courses, and workshops encompassing many 
aspects of the media arts.
Beginning October 9, documentary photogra
pher Walter Rosenblum and his wife Dr. Naomi 
Rosenblum will be conducting an artists residency 
at the Pittsburgh Filmmakers Oakland Screening 
Room. The residency is co-sponsored by Pittsburgh 
Filmmakers and Blatent Image/Silver Eye Gal
lery.
Walter Rosenblum was a professor of photogra
phy at Brooklyn College for 40 years before retiring 
in 1987. He is also past president of the Photogra
phy League, a group which uses photography to 
document social conditions in the world. Dr. Naomi 
Rosenblum is the author of A World of Photogra
phy, a comprehensive 
look at the field. She has 
taught photography his
tory at Parsons School 
of Design and art his
tory at Brooklyn College.
The Rosenblums will 
be participating in a 
series of classes and lec
tures that will use their 
vast experience in social 
and documentary pho
tography. They will also 
focus on different pho
tography techniques and

contemporary styles. Participants are invited to 
bring their own photographs and film work for 
viewing.
The three day workshop will be $85 for the 
general public, and $75 for members of Pittsburgh 
Filmmakers and Blatent Image/Silver Eye. The 
public is invited to a lecture by Walter Rosenblum 
about his work this Friday at 7 pm at the Oakland 
Screening Room. A reception will follow. For more 
information, call (412) 681-5449.
This is just the beginning of the events sponsored 
by Pittsburgh Filmmakers for the month of Octo
ber. From October 7-13, two very different films 
will be showing at the Fulton. Robert Franks
Candy Mountain is a story of a young musician 
who is on a quest to find Elmore Silk, the worlds 
greatest guitar maker, who disappeared from the 
New York scene several years ago. It is a road 
movie that ends up on the last street of the last 
town in America. Also showing will be Desire 
Ecares Faces of Women. This film was a sensation 
at the Cannes Film Festival and shouldnt be 
missed. The film examines the role of modem 
African women in an extremely tradition-bound 
society. It blends comedy, pounding African music, 
and feminism.
The third annual Lesbian and Gay Film Festival 
of Pittsburgh will be held at the Fulton from 
October 14-20. The program includes films dealing 
with very diverse topics. These topics include the 
exploration of gay parents and the lifetime com
mitments of gay people.
On Friday, October 21, the Fulton will present 
Alexander Askoldovs Commissar. Set during the 
Russian Civil War of the 1920s, Commissar tells 
the story of a rugged and pregnant Red Army 
commissar who is ordered to live with a poor, but 
loving Jewish family. Askoldov fought bureau
cratic odds to complete the film, but it was banned 
by the Russian govern
ment upon completion.
On Friday, October 28 
at 8 pm, the Oakland 
Screening Room will 
show samples of 
filmmaker Alan 
Berliners work. Ber
liner has been making 
avant garde films for 
almost 15 years. Since 
1980 he has completed 
many collage films 
which utilize his vast 
personal library of 
sounds and images. On Saturday from 1-3 pm, 
Berliner will conduct a workshop that explores 
editing methods used in his own professional and 
personal work. That evening, Berliners The Family 
Album will be screened at the Carnegie. Berliners 
visit is co-sponsored by Pittsburgh Filmmakers 
and the Carnegie Section of Film and Video.
The screening of The Family Album is Pitts
burgh Filmmakers final major event of the month. 
October is going to be a great month packed with a 
number of excellent opportunities. There is defi
nitely something for everyone. If you have any 
questions or are interested in a membership, Pitts
burgh Filmmakers welcomes your calls.

Classic drama highlights New Group
By STEPHEN GLICKER
Tartan Staffwriter
The New Group Theater, a 
company that runs quite out 
of the ordinary plays, has 
announced the opening of 
their 1988-89 season. TheNew 
Group Theater is a company 
whose aim is not only to 
merely entertain, but to pro
voke, to challenge, to explore, 
and to illuminate the audi
ence. The season features the 
works of six master play
wrights.
From November 17-December 10, Henrik Ibsens Rosmersholm will be featured. 
Rosmersholm is an enigmatic 
modem tragedy, haunting, 
maddening and strange, con
taining the most compelling 
and unfathomable of Ibsens 
great female characters, Re
becca West. The play has been 
called obscure, mystical, un
intelligible, and an enigma 
devised to disturb the audi
ence. A play surely not to be 
' missed!
Martin Giles is next with
his Brats With Spoons playing 
from January 19-February 4. 
Brats With Spoons is the third 
episode in the comedic Saga of 
Inspector Sloane. Along the way 
there are varieties of sex, prat
falls, ghosts, gratuitous violence, 
soaring discourses and some 
great crooning.
Anatol by Arthur Schnizler is a 
droll, stylish, slightly cynical 
comedy. Like a series of fine 
photographs, it highlights the 
decisive moments in the love 
affairs ofthe quintessential manabout-Vienna, Anatol. Freud 
found it amusing, and that should 
be reason enough to see this play. 
Anatol is playingfrom March 16- 
April 1.
From May 11-May 27 Dario 
Fos Cant Pay ? Wont Pay! will 
beplaying.Can'iPay? Wont Pay! 
is an extravagant, sure-fire com
edy filled with gags. Its got eve
rything from great sight gags to 
full flying wit (and some flying 
groceries) to pointed social com
mentary about what happens 
when ordinary working people 
get fed up in a world of inflation, 
shortage, rampant bureaucracy,
corruption, terrorist bombing, 
and invasion of privacy. This 
play has it all; dont miss it.
The season closes with, 
Anton Chekhovs The Threes 
Sisters playing from Septem
ber 7-September 23. The Three 1 
Sisters is the classic comedy 
about three sisters and their ;a 
circle of acquaintances in a 
provincial Russian town. Itis 
a depiction of life as it was for usome particular people in a n 
particular place and time, but r 
gives the sense of displaying 
all of humanity as well. It is'a~ 
deeply sad, profound andtimeless play.
An original work to be an
nounced will be playing from 
July 13-July 29. Season tick
ets for the seventh season are 
available for $20. Individual 
ticket price is $4. All perform
ances are Thursday, Friday, 
and Saturday evenings at 8:00 
pm. The theater is located at 
5518 Penn Avenue in Bloom
field. For more information 
about tickets or the upcoming 
season, contact the New 
Group Theater at 361-2488.

a*and iand disease
Dr. Allan Ebbin, director of the University of 
Southern Californias Student Health Center, 
says that students are less willing to have 
casual encounters than they were four or five 
years ago....In the sexual contacts that they do 
have, students appear to be far more selective 
than once was the case.
A senior Information and Decision Systems 
major and Phi Kappa Theta brother feels that 
his small town upbringing has made him more 
conservative than most of the men at CMU. 
When asked if the threat of sexually transmitted 
diseases has made him change his sexual habits, 
he responded, Yes, those things will kill you 
these days. He also revealed that if he got a 
woman pregnant that he didnt love, ten to one I 
would still marry her. I couldnt give you four 
people that would do the same thing, he added.
Dr. Richard P. Keeling, chairman of the AIDS 
Task Force for the American College Health As
sociation, has a theory that a conservative 
political and economic climate, heightened 
image conciousness among students, and a 
greater stress on career preparation all promote 
a greater sense of restrictions, among them in 
sexuality.
The comments of the CMU freshman quoted 
earlier do not reflect the conservative attitude 
that Dr. Keeling and Dr. Ebbin say is growing on 
college campuses. The freshman explained that 
the men she has slept with here were gentle
men with high morals....I talked to their friends 
to find out if they had a sexually transmitted 
disease and they said they were okay.
While these actions may not be representative 
of a conservative attitude, they do seem to be 
representative of other college students atti
tudes. A 1987 Glamour magazine survey of 1,200 
students across the nation revealed that of the 
80% of students who have changed their sex 
lives in response to AIDS, the majority have 
become more selective in who they sleep with by 
quizzing their prospective partners friends

The free-wheeling sexual adventurism of the 
previous student generation seems to be on its 
way to the pages of cultural history.
Dr. Sandra Hofferth of the National Institute 
of Child Health and Human Development, in the 
January 11th issue o/U.S. News and World
Report.
Judging from the comments of many students, 
free-wheeling sexual adventurism may still 
thrive at Carnegie Mellon. When asked if she 
had had sex with anyone since coming to college, 
a freshman Art and Design major admitted that 
she has slept with two different men since 
coming here. The first one she knew only two 
weeks.
According to Newsweek magazine, university 
health officials launched aggressive campaigns 
in the 70s to combat the plague of sexually 
transmitted diseases brought on by the in
creased sexual freedom of the decade. Although 
no national statistics exist for colleges alone, 
over the past five years most university health 
officials have reported significant drops in the 
number of cases of syphilis and gonorrhea and 
no substantial increase in the incidence of 
genital herpes.
In the 80s, however, students have a much 
more perilous sexually transmitted disease to 
worry about: AIDS. In the October 3, 1988 issue 
of U.S. News and World Report, the AIDS Task 
Force for the American College Health Associa
tion estimated that there are 700 AIDS cases on 
campuses out of a full-time student population of 
over eight million.
A survey of University of Maryland students 
published in the Christian Science Monitor re
ported that while students were knowledgeable 
about AIDS and how it can be transmitted, they 
werent doing enough with their knowledge in 
terms of changing their own behavior. However,

Black students enthusiastic about CMAP
By LORI MARRACINO

Before entering Carnegie Mellon 
as freshmen, prospective black stu
dents are invited to attend a fiveweek summer program of study de
signed to orient them into the rigor
ous academics of the university. For 
most, this attendance is mandatory 
and, as they are informed, their 
admission to the school can be con
tingent upon it.
The most negative aspect of the 
program for these students is its 
timing, taking up a large portion of

could be vacationing or earning money 
for school. Despite this sentiment, how
ever, some of the students were glad for 
the opportunity to become acquainted 
with the campus and feel comfortable 
here without the majority of the student 
body being around.
Perhaps the most controversial part 
of CMAP is that, with a few exceptions,
each black student must successfully 
complete the program to attend CMU. 
However, though students might have 
been at first resentful of this require
ment, each one admitted having a change 
of attitude while they were involved in 
CMAP.

Twenty years of action for minorities
By CATHERINE LOMONICO
Tartan Staffwriter
This summer marked the 20th 
anniversary of the founding of the 
Carnegie Mellon Action Project 
(CMAP). The primary goal of CMAP 
is the development of students who 
are capable of competition in the 
many fields of study offered by CMU 
engineering, science, business, lib
eral arts and the fine arts.
CMAP was established in 1968 as 
a program to aid the university in re
cruiting minority students and then 
to provide these students with aca
demic and supportive services during 
their upcoming years at CMU. The staff 
at CMAP represents every college within 
CMU and is committed to the programs 
and services offered for the minority 
students at the university.
CMAP has several key programs it 
offers the minority students: a pre-col
lege summer program, academic track
ing, monitoring, a complete tutoring 
program, personal counseling, career 
placement services, professional devel
opment services and the various social 
and academic clubs it supports.
The pre-college summer program lasts 
five weeks and is designed to familiarize
incoming freshmen with the atmosphere 
of competition, the intensity, and the 
amount of work they will discover the 
following semester. The classes the 
students take include mathematics, 
physics, chemistry, and English, all of 
which will help develop study skills and 
self-discipline. The objectives of the 
courses are to build problem-solving 
skills, a necessary ability to survive the 
academics at CMU. The objective of the 
summer program is to allow the staff to 
evaluate the abilities of the students, 
enabling the staff to counsel them with 
their academics.

Ah, but no, I hear you protest,
I am a real person, with money,

may be, but youre still living 
under the snuggly blanket of the

Anorexia ner
vosa and bulimia 
nervosa are eat
ing disorders 
which are preva
lent in the col
lege-aged popu
lation. Although they are felt to 
 be caused by psychosocial fac
tors, serious medical complica
tions can result. This article is 
intended to introduce you to 
some of the medical aspects of 
eating disorders.
Anorexia nervosa is a disor
der characterized by extreme 
weight loss, disturbance of body 
image, and fear of obesity. Bu
limia nervosa is an associated 
condition characterized by sur
reptitious binge-eating followed 
by purging (i.e., self-induced 
vomiting, fasting, use of laxa
tives and diuretics). Both syn
dromes involve intense preoc
cupation with food, weight and 
body image. Anorexia is always 
associated with marked weight 
loss, while bulimics may have 
mild or moderate weight 
changes. Significant health 
problems and even death are 
more common in anorexia than 
in most other psychiatric ill
nesses.
Eating disorders are said to 
affect five to ten percent of ado
lescent girls and women in our 
culture. The true incidence of 
anorexia nervosa is uncertain, 
but estimates range from 0.01% 
to 1% of the young female popu
lation. The estimates of preva
lence of bulimia vary between 
4.5% and 18% of the high school 
and college population. Ninety

to ninety-five percent of anorec
tics and bulimics are female. Most 
are white and from middle or 
upper-middle class families.
Anorexia nervosa commonly 
begins in an adolescent female 
who is either overweight or per
ceives herself as such. Moderate 
efforts at weight loss escalate to 
a preoccupation with thinness, 
and drastic changes in eating 
patterns. Weight loss is at
tempted either by severe restric
tion of caloric intake, or by re
striction alternating with binge 
eating episodes which terminate 
in self-induced vomiting, or use 
of laxatives and diuretics. Exces
sive exercise as a means of achiev
ing weight loss is employed, and 
occasionally predates weight loss 
or other symptoms.
Bulimia typically begins in late 
adolescence or early adulthood 
after a series of attempts at diet
ing and weight loss have been 
unsuccessful. The patient discov
ers that self-induced vomiting or 
laxative use can aid in weight 
loss. Bulimics typically binge on 
junk foods which are rich in car
bohydrates, and do so in secrecy. 
The binging-purging behavior 
often interferes with the bulimics 
professional and social life, and 
the shame and embarrassment 
may deepen her isolation. Other 
impulsive behaviors, such as 
alcohol and drug abuse, are 
common in bulimics. The 
bulimics weight may fluctuate, 
but not to the profound degree 
seen in anorectics. Unlike the 
anorectic, who typically denies 
any problem, the bulimic is dis
tressed by her symptoms and is 
willing to accept help.
The medical complications of 
anorexia are referable to starva
tion. Those of bulimia result from 
binging and purging. Anorexia is 
associated with more severe 
complication, and has a mortal
ity rate, excluding suicide, ap
proaching nine percent.
Among anorectics, the most 
common medical problems are 
amenorrhea (loss of menstrual 
periods), and estrogen deficiency. 
Estrogen deficiency, in combina
tion with poor nutrition, can lead 
to osteoporosis (thinning of bone). 
Once weight is restored, the 
majority of patients do resume 
menstrual periods, although 
some have persistent abnormali
ties. One interesting and poorly 
understood phenomenon is that 
about twenty percent of patients
with anorexia have 
amenorrhea before 
weight loss.
Most problems 
seen in anorectics 
are shared with 
other patients sufferingextreme weight loss. There 
can be difficulty adapting to 
changes in temperature due to 
loss of body fat and to changes in 
the hypothalamus, the brain 
center controlling temperature 
regulation. Thinning of the walls 
of the heart can occur, causing 
impairment in the pumping of 
blood and lowering of the blood 
pressure. Cardiac arrhythimias 
(excessively rapid or slow heart
beats) can occur. Other problems 
seen are kidney stones, salt and 
fluid imbalances, abdominal pain 
and bloating, constipation, ankle 
swelling, and low blood count. 
Most of these problems are re
versible if addressed at an early 
stage.
Bulimia is associated with 
another group of medical prob
lems. Menstrual irregularities 
are less common, affecting only 
about 20% of patients. Bingeeating can cause swelling and 
even rupture of the stomach. 
Repeated vomiting can cause 
swelling of the salivary glands, 
erosion of dental enamel, and 
inflammation or tearing of the 
esophagus. Choking while vom
iting sometimes occurs, and can 
cause serious lung infections. 
Potassium, an essential salt in 
the body, can become depleted 
due to vomiting, laxative and 
diuretic use. Ipecac, a substance 
used to induce vomiting in cases 
of poisoning or overdose, is occa
sionally abused by bulimics. 
Chronic use can lead to absorp
tion of this drug by the body. 
Toxic effects which especially 
affect the heart often result.
The primary treatment of ano
rexia and bulimia is psychother
apy. Medical complications gen
erally abate once the starvation 
or binging/purging are termi
nated. Occasionally patierifl 
become so ill from starvation or 
other complications that hospi
talization is required. Some pai 
tients have benefited from psy
chiatric drugs, but the mainstay 
of treatment remains psychiat1

CSP helps plan for the future
By DEBORAH J. SAX
Tartan Asst. Darkroom Editor
How many of you are se
cretly unhappy with your cur
rent major, but just dont know 
where to turn for help? Al, though some of the fortunate 
among you are decided and 
satisfied with your major, 
many of you are not. If you feel 
constrained, uncomfortable or 
just plain undecided in your 
nmajor, then Career Services 
,,and Placement (CSP) has 
.something to offer you. In 
, addition to being a job place
ment service, CSP has another 
important function: career 
counseling.
This branch of the CSP be
gan approximately three years 
ago, when Karen Litzinger, 
Assistant Director of Career 
Development at CSP, saw a 
need for career counseling 
among CMU students. She 
noticed that while plenty of 
u>emphasis was placed on a 
students academic perform"Litzinger encourages the students to 
be open-minded 
about their futures. 
'nr ance, little attention was given 
to the students happiness and 
satisfaction with his long range
Students come to Litzinger 
-for a variety of reasons. Some 
just need career information 
non their decided major. Others 
come because they cannot 
decide between majors. The
Strong Assessment Interest In
ventory (SAII) can be a useful 
tool for these students. The SAII 
is a computer-generated test 
which attempts to help them 
evaluate their personal skills, 
interests, and values. Students 
then use this information to make 
educated guesses about them
selves, and what careers are 
suited to them. It helped me to 
sort out my options, and con
firmed some deeply held suspi
cions about my own changing 
interests. It was helpful. No 
miracles, but helpful, said one 
MCS senior. The test is not a 
solution to the career choice deci
sion; rather, it should be viewed 
as an eye-opening tool.
Most students schedule career 
counseling because they are 
unsatisfied with their current 
major, and they just dont know 
where to turn. Litzinger and the 
student apply the technique of 
brainstorming in order discover 
possible career opportunities. 
The student evaluates his or her 
values, skills, and interests. 
Together they explore the possi
bilities.
At this stage, Litzinger encour
ages the students to be openminded about their futures. The 
traditional- career options are 
considered, but mostly the coun
seling time is spent on coming up 
with combination careers: crea
tive solutions to the problem of 
career choice. The Career Re
sources Library is a valuable 
asset at this stage. The library 
contains a diverse collection of 
literature with titles such as

pations for the Year 2000 and

are used to stimulate and in

she can make a better decision 
about life and the future.
Perhaps because this uni
versity is know as the profes
sional choice, students here 
feel less able to admit their 
uncertainty, says Litzinger. 
However, if an uncertain stu
dent is unhappy, ignoring the 
problem will not make it go 
away. Youve got to remem

So, you chose to come to 
Carnegie Mellon because you 
wanted to make the profes
sional choice. Yet today, you 
find that youre nervous at the 
thought of your impending life 
as a professional. Youve spent 
the last four or more years of 
your life sweating it out for 
that degree. Where do you go 
from here?
The placement department 
of the Career Services and 
Placement office (CSP) offers 
a variety of programs geared 
specifically for those soon to 
graduate. Often, employers 
will visit CMU in hopes of re
cruiting, and by visiting CSP,
you can schedule interviews with 
the companies of your choice.
In addition to the on-campus 
interviewing, CSP offers a job 
referral service. The placement 
counselors receive information 
about several thousand job op
portunities from companies that 
cannot afford to visit and inter
view on location. They then match 
the job descriptions with the 
interests and goals of registered 
seniors, and then notify the com
panies about compatible stu
dents. The office also publishes a 
book of senior resumes, to be used 
by employers visiting Carnegie 
Mellon. These services are de
signed to help bridge the gap 
between senior and employer. 
However, they are only available 
to those seniors who have regis
tered through CSP.
In addition to the multitude of 
services provided through regis
tration, CSP has compiled an 
information packet especially for 
seniors. The packet was designed 
to aid the student in his active job 
search and includes a three vol
ume set of the CPC (College Place
ment Counsel) annual. This docu
ment resembles a reverse res
ume book: in it, employers can 
advertise to seniors what they 
have to offer. After a student 
spends time searching, he may 
become overwhelmed at his 
number of options  instead of 
needed information about job 
opportunities, some seniors need 
help in selecting and discrimi
nating. The senior packet also 
contains information on How to 
Rate a Job, and the counselors 
are prepared to help a student 
assess his or her goals before he 
or she makes crucial decisions.
Although the emphasis of the
placement counselors appears 
to be on job placement, they 
also provide information and 
counseling to those consider
ing graduate school. The Ca
reer Resource Library contains 
information and statistics on 
many mtyor universities. In
formation regarding applica
tion, entrance requirements, 
and fellowship opportunity is 
also available. In addition, 
several graduate schools will 
be represented at the Gradu
ate School Fair in the Ball
room on October 25.
Students can register and 
pick up packets at the Career 
Services and Placement office, 
located in the basement of 
Warner Hall, any time between 
the hours of 8:30 and 5:00, 
Monday through Friday. You 
can also browse through the 
Career Resource Library for 
more information on jobs and 
graduate schools.
If you still have questions 
pertaining to placement serv
ices and what they can offer
CSP has compiled 
an information 
packet especially for

during walk-in hours (3:30-

placement counselors. Coun

about the partners sexual 
history. But even this precau
tion doesnt seem to reduce the 
risks of contracting a STD.
-According to Dr. H. Hunter 
Handsfield, director of the King 
County Public Health Depart
ment in Seattle, The average 
girl who becomes sexually active 
17 has a better than 50/50 
chance of getting an STD by the 
time she reaches twenty-seven, 
and if she has anonymous con
tacts with multiple partners, 
closer to a 100% chance of infec
tion.

Gile  primarily chlamydia, 
{jenital warts, and NGU  have 
fairly high incidence among 
e student body. And AIDS is 
not unknownat least one CMU 
student has tested positive for 
tne disease.
According to Anita Barkin, the 
director of CMUs Health Cen
ter, Chlamydia is epidemic in
this country. Chlamydia has 
been called the disease of the 
80s by the Center for Disease 
Control in Atlanta, and is now 
striking close to 10% of female 
CMU students.
Treatment for STDs is avail
able right at CMU. The Carnegie 
Mellon Health Center, located 
on the ground floor of Morewood 
Gardens E-Tower, offers coun
seling and free tests for any stu
dent who suspects he or she is the 
victim of an STD, including AIDS.
Its kind of one of the areas 
that college health professionals 
specialize in, said Barkin. She 
stressed the confidentiality of the 
centers testing, and mentioned 
that free antibiotics are avail
able if tests do come back posi
tive.
Newsweek summed up the ef
fect that STDs will have on our 
nations college students: Tradi
tionally college has been a place 
of sexual experimentation. That 
wont change. But as the AIDS 
virus spreads, the price of care
less curiosity will rise.

Wombats and Maintenance Elves invade the housing office
Tm.nort.ant fact Oth.fi week: Thj> 
president of Student Government
- is named Andrew.
Important quote O the week: 
"We will have The Cut back for 
frisbee and other important ac
tivities.
Richard Cyert, State O the 
Onion speech (Oh, Yeah!)
Bikes are great, they really are.
I know mine is. Its an ancient 
British road racer that really 
hates to be ridden on grass, which 
is naturally what I do all the 
time. Its a nice bike, but dont 
you dare think about stealing it!
I always keep it padlocked to 
Quito Monzola. He eats at Kiltie 
and LIKES it.
Anyway, bikes are great if you 
live in Far-Off campus housing 
like I do. Every morning approxi
mately four seconds before class 
starts I hop on The Blue Tor
nado and zip down Devonshire 
and over several squirrels to 
campus, just in time to be late for
my first class: Problems and 
Changes in Modem Wombat 
Control, 42-101. Lately weve 
been learning how to use cattle 
prods to coax miscreant wom
bats from under Tony Martins 
desk.
In case you may be wondering 
why wombats should be inhabit
ing the office of the Director of 
Housing, the connection should 
be obvious. As you know, the 
housing office has been losing 
scads of money these last few
years by undercharging for CMU 
Shadyside Condominiums, oth
erwise known as University 
Housing. Add that to the cost of 
billing us to clean the rooms every 
year and the money is simply 
beyond the processing power of a 
Mac Plus. Naturally theyve de
cided to sell wombat furs to im
poverished Eskimos for profit. 
Maybe theyll be able to afford 
another Maintenance Elf. The 
Maintenance Elf is a little guy 
with a funny beard and the 
master room key. He goes around 
fixing things in your room when 
you least expect it. He fixed our 
light fixture last week, and only 
a year after we asked for it to be 
replaced, too! Wow! Thats faster 
than repairmen in Poland!
Please note that the Mainte
nance Elf is separate from Hous
ing Elves who dump your laun
dry on the floor of the laundry 
room while youre not looking; 
and Kitchen Elves who tromp 
through the yogurt and jello so
How not to lay an egg in the kitchen
You come home one evening 
and peer in the refrigerator. 
Theres a pop-tart, half a conr-tainer of milk, and five eggs, 
j# QUESTION: What do you 
make for dinner? Five points if 
you said eggs.
ANOTHER QUESTION: Is 
'. that a really uncool dinner? Take 
away three points if you said 
yes.
Eggs are not uncool, and theyre 
not just for breakfast anymore. 
~ Some of my best friends are egg
heads. Eggs are not high in calo
ries (one boiled egg has 80 calo
ries), although they are moder
ately high in cholesterol. And eggs 
form the basis for gourmet reci
pes like souffles and quiches.
When you buy eggs, open the 
carton and check each egg to 
make sure it isnt cracked. Eggs 
in the supermarket are usually 
fresh, but if you want to make 
sure they are without actually 
cracking them open, drop each 
one (gently) in a bowl of water 
when you get home. If it sinks, 
its okay. If it floats, ditch it or 
take it back to the store (they 
should honor your request for a 
new egg, but if they dont its a 
bad idea to throw the offending 
egg at the offending manager). 
When making something that 
calls for more than one egg, al
ways crack each one into a glass 
and examine it to make sure its 
okay (no rotten-egg odor, no 
i^bloodspots) before throwing it in 
with the rest of the eggs.
Souffles are relatively easy, but
M
only if you have a hand mixer or 
a. blender (I tried it once with a 
wire whisk to see whether I could 
stiffen the egg whites before my 
arm gave outfifteen minutes 
was my limit and I wasnt even 
close). If you make quiche, you 
dont have to separate and whip 
the egg whites, so its a more 
feasible optionespecially for 
people without lots of kitchen 
equipment.
Basic Easy Quiche 
Beat six or eight eggs with a 
quarter cup of milk. Add salt and 
pepper to taste. Add desired fla
vorings. Pour in a prepared pie 
crust (or just put in a casserole 
dish, if you want the crust) and 
bake at 400 until the egg is solidi
fied. Flavorings that are good 
include any combination of the 
following: bacon (fry it first and 
thoroughly drain the grease), 
spinach (buy it frozen and 
chopped; thaw it first and drain 
all the excess liquid before add
ing it to the eggs), ham, salami, 
cheese (Swiss or Gruyere works 
well), frozen baby shrimp, potato 
(sliced about 1/2 inch thick; you 
can steam it first if youre conDINNER FORTWO-S955plus tax

The other day I took time off 
from my workstudy job of rear
ranging the HH20 cluster signs 
so that they point to the womens 
restroom. I went to talk to Mr. 
Tony Martin (code name: Guy 
Smiley) with my roommates. Its 
hard to say anything bad about 
Guy, but he did unnerve me a bit.
First off, he passed the collection 
plate around six times while my 
roommates and I were in his of
fice. We went to see him because 
at the time we wanted to move 
from our Way-Off campus apart
ment to a house on Beeler St, 
which is a whole lot fucking bet
ter for half the price! As one of my 
roommates put it, University 
housing is shit. Of course this is 
the same roommate who said, 
Guts and French toast are what 
makes this campus such a pleas
ing turd stockade and Youll 
never be able to fit the guts and 
French toast quote into your col
umn, Steve. Anyway, as we sat 
there in his office sitting on our 
hands trying not to look too anx
ious to leave, even though we had 
every possession already packed 
into the Flying Zamboni Broth
ers Moving Truck Co. Movers 
Moving Inc. moving truck ready 
to hike on over to Beeler St. and 
begin our life in the lap of luxury, 
Guy had this to say: Id like to 
help you, but no. It seems that 
the Hoseing Office has too many 
vacancies, and with one or two 
people dropping out every week, 
they need every possible cent to 
keep paying the Maintenance Elf.
This makes me wonder whats 
going to be done with the new 
dorm. If housing has vacancies

pieces of broccoli, minced garlic, 
chopped onion, sliced mushroom.
Omelettes 
An omelette, as you know, is a 
flat sheet of scrambled eggs (two 
or three eggs to the average 
omelette) folded over around 
some filling like peanut butter 
and jelly (dont laugh at the con
ceptmy brother used to eat 
PB&J omelettes every day for 
breakfast). The secret to a suc
cessful omelette is a non-stick 
pan, or at least a very well greased 
one. Prepare your omelette fill
ing (it could be just about any
thing) ahead of time and have it 
ready. When you pour the beaten 
eggs in the pan, the pan should 
be hot enough that the egg starts 
to cook right away, but not so hot 
that the egg will stick and bum. 
Nobody likes a blackened 
omelette. When it has begun to 
cook, nudge a comer of it away 
from the pan and tilt the pan so 
that some of the uncooked egg 
runs down to the exposed pan 
surface. When the omelette be
gins to bubble off the pan, place 
your desired filling on one side of 
the omelette, an inch away from 
the edge on that side (if youre a 
lefty, put it on the right side of 
the omelette, and vice versa). 
Dont put in too much filling. With 
a spatula, flip the other half over 
the filling. Cover the pan and let 
it cook for two minutes or so be
fore turning off the burner. Let it 
sit a minute more before serving.

L6The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  4 October 1988
CMAPs a big help, say students
continued from page LI
at having to come, but later they 
learned the value of the knowl
edge base given in the CMAP 
program, commented David 
White, a junior Psychology and 
Information Systems major who 
became a counselor for CMAP 
after completing the program as 
a freshman.
One of the goals of CMAP is to 
bring in students who might not 
otherwise attend Carnegie Mel
lon. Many CMAP alumni felt 
more positively about the uni
versity after the experience. 
Keisha Watson, a Technical 
Writing major, feels that CMAP
had a strong influence on her. 
The summer program was in
strumental in my decision to 
attend Carnegie Mellon.
During the program, students 
find the coursework to be quite 
intense, and actually have less 
free time than they do now. The 
amount of work was, however, 
balanced by the degree of per
sonal attention that the students 
received. Student-teacher ratios 
were small, and students found 
extra help to be easily accessible.
There is, however, a strong ten
dency for students to blow off 
part of their work, especially 
during the last few weeks. This is
partly because the work that is 
done during the summer is in 
most ways unofficial. Grades 
from CMAP do not go on perma
nent records, and some students 
lack motivation to work ab.ove 
the basic requirements.
The most frequently occurring 
theme for the students involved 
in CMAP is that the problems of 
being a minority student at such 
a demandinguniversity are prob
lems that they all share and can 
handle together. Strong friend
ships develop during the five 
weeks of the pre-college program 
and last throughout school, and 
have a positive effect on academic
performance. What makes the 
CMAP summer program special 
is the relationships that are built 
there, relationships that are 
important to academic success 
here, said Jerome Napson, a 
junior majoring in mathematics.
CMAP also offers programs 
such as tutoring and career place
ment for black students during 
their years at Carnegie Mellon. 
The summer program is a first 
step, and one which the students 
find extremely useful. The over
all effect of the program is to give 
minority students an orientation 
from which they can perform most 
successfully at Carnegie Mellon.
An in-depth examination of...
Those housing blues
continued from page L5
now, what are they going to do 
with a whole new empty build
ing? I asked janitor and ABM 
veteran Ralph R. Rudolph. They 
arent really sure what to do wit 
th new dorm. In fact, Ive heard 
that theyre gonna start building 
freshmen rooms in DH 2210, 
since half of em spend th day 
there anyways. Actually I hear 
th new dorm is gonna be used fer 
raisn wombats or somethin.
As I see it, the whole construc
tion site is probably a senior 
design project. That business 
with the orange tape was only for 
the freshmen. In about a week 
the guy in charge will decide on a 
final position for the bulldozers 
that best combines style, art, 
method, and gastric distress.
What the heck is gastric dis
tress? It sounds almost as if your 
stomach is about to send up a 
flare to call the Coast Guard for 
assistance.
Anyway, my roommates and I 
wont be moving into the new 
dorm, which will be named the
CMAPs 
programs 
target Black 
problems
continued from page LI
During the following years of 
academic growth, students in the 
CMAP program can take advan
tage of the many services offered 
them. For professional develop
ment, CMAP sponsors seminars 
that offer information about op
portunities and developments 
within their fields. Additional 
workshops sponsored by CMAP 
focus on career development, 
writing resumes, interviewing 
techniques, and job finding 
strategies.
CMAP also supports several 
black organizations on campus, 
including SPIRIT, the National 
Society of Black Engineers, and 
the Voices United Gospel Choir. 
SPIRIT provides a social and 
cultural awareness through in
tellectual and extracurricular ac
tivities. It is also the sponsor of 
Black History month and Martin 
Luther King Day celebrations. 
SPIRIT is widely known on 
campus for its participation in 
Spring Carnival, including its 
record-breaking times in the 
buggy races.
The National Society of Black 
Engineers (NSBE) is a national 
organization that has been part 
of a nationwide effort to increase 
the numbers of minorities in 
engineering. The NSBE works 
closely with CMAP by contribut
ing to academic and professional 
development through workshops 
on campus. The Voices United 
Gospel Choir is a student run 
campus organization that is 
powered by the leadership of 
CMAP students. The choir has 
annual concerts on campus, a3 
well as at churches and colleges 
in the area.
CMAP plays an important role 
academically and culturally by 
supporting minority groups on 
campus as well as providing serv
ices promoting academic survival 
at CMU.
John Sculley Memorial Apple 
Hall, as I doubt will many other 
upperclassmen. I asked Sopho
more Joe BagoDoughnuts if he 
would move into the new dorm. 
Hell, no! Ive had it with paying 
some bozo to tromp down the hall 
and harangue me for playing my 
WierdAl tapes too loud. Ive never 
been written up for bad taste 
before. Not many people in my 
dorm like our RA. I think he has 
paranoid delusions that were all 
out to get him. Its true, we are.

CSP looks to the future
continued from page L3
viduals realize ten years after 
college that theyve never been 
satisfied with their choice of 
career. Litzinger encourages 
students to be honest with 
themselves when choosing.
No matter what, the final 
choice of major and career is in 
your hands. Be honest with 
yourself. Do you really desire 
to major in humanities, but 
fear that by changing colleges, 
you will be wimping out? Or, 
do you wish to study a science, 
but dont have the courage to 
transfer to MCS? Has your 
major been decided by your 
parents, without you having 
any say in the matter? Do you
feel constrained in your ma
jor?
If you can answer yes to 
any of these questions, you 
should stop and think about 
what it is that makes you 
happy. Perhaps you can solve 
your problems on your own, or 
with the help of friends  but 
if these methods dont help, 
schedule an appointment with 
Litzinger at x2064.
Even if you are satisfied with 
your major, you still may want 
to give CSP a visit. The Career 
Resource Library contains a 
multitude of information re
garding possibilities. Who 
knows, it may open your eyes 
to a world of opportunities.

Thank God the games are over
" Thank God the Olympics are 
finally over! Maybe now, Ill fi
nally be able to get some work 
Ijone around this place.
;; What was going through my 
English professors mind when 
he assigned that paper? Didnt 
lihe bonehead know that the 
United States was playing the 
6oviet Union in basketball that 
flight? How did he expect me, 
"jind my fellow patriots, to work 
Ijivith that game going on?
1 My interest in this game was 
"twofold: Aside from being a great 
blympic contest, this was the rematch of the 1972 Olympic game 
*when the U.S. was robbed of the 
*gold medal. I wasnt going to miss 
$his for anything.
Due to the 1980 and 1984 boy
cotts, these were the first Olym
pics in twelve years where the 
Sj.S. could face the Eastern Block 
athletes and thus, answer some 
questions as to who the best really 
$s. But while this years basket
ball team lost, the U.S. did domi
nate in other events.
! The beach boys on the U.S. 
volleyball team proved once and 
for all that a little sun and surf 
rcan do wonders for the dig and 
spike. While, the Soviet team will 
have to wonder if borscht really 
j^s the breakfast of champions.
The American baseball team 
illustrated that with players like 
iJim Abbott, the U.S. can win one? lianded over any team in the 
world. I cannot wait until 1992 inRlBarcelona when baseball will 
finally become a full medal sport.
In the individual sports, swim
mer Matt Biondi did his best to 
better Mark Spitzs seven gold 
medals in 1972, but alas, only 
won five golds, one silver, and 
"one bronze. In addition, Greg 
Louganis will probably go down 
jin history as the epitome of excel
lence in diving.
However, even though we had 
$ lot to be proud of, some U.S. 
Athletes got their proverbial teeth 
kicked in by officials and poor 
judges.
' The womens gymnastic team 
was robbed of the silver medal by 
a patriotic East German official. 
But the worst travesty since the 
J.972 basketball game was this 
gears Light Middleweight gold 
medal fight.
i Americas Roy Jones showed 
that his training with Sugar Ray 
Leonard paid off. He landed 
powerful left hooks at will against 
his South Korean opponent. 
Everyone, including the South 
Korean media, picked Jones as 
the winner, but he still lost by a 
judges score of 3-2.
He could have rejected the 
medal as the 1972 basketball 
team did, and rightly so. But 
Jones showed more class and 
Courage by simply accepting the 
Silver medal. Standing on that 
podium and listening to the 
Korean National Anthem was 
gainful for Jones, he did it though, 
ihus countering an image that 
nas hounded the entire U.S. team 
throughout these games.
;! Ever since the opening ceremo
nies, when the team casually 
-'jaunted in to the stadium, some 
Members wearing Mickey Mouse 
sars, U.S. athletes have been 
Rubbed as a group of low class, 
disrespectful showboats.
S! The U.S. won 94 medals in all 
ir~ 36 gold. We came in behind 
$ast Germany who had 102 in 
Wl, and the Soviets who domi
nated with 132 medals55 gold. 
We have a lot to be proud of, but 
We also have reason to be upset,

Volleyball earns 4th seed at UAA Round Robin
Soccer team suffering halfway through season
Mens X-Country wins 96th straight
By DAN HOLLAND
Tartan Staffwriter
The Mens Cross-Country team added another 
victory to their unbeaten streak of dual meet wins 
by dominating Hiram College this weekend.
Victory number 96 was led by Junior Gary Meeker 
in a blazing personal record of 26:37. The Tartans 
won by a decisive score of 16-43.
Carnegie Mellon put its next four runners out in 
front of Hirams first man. Freshman John Frieder, 
redshirting the meet, was second with 26:43. 
Following closely behind were freshman Mike 
Damon, in 26:52, sophomore Dan Holland, in 27:05 
and junior Gary Harrison anchoring the top five 
with a time of 27:19. Most of the CMU squad set 
personal records at the meet.
Coach Gary Meckley attributes the good showing 
to the weather. It was a good day for running, said 
Meckley, who is enjoying the success of one of his 
best teams ever. He gave top runners Dave Supp,
Pat Noll and Len ONeal the weekend off in hopes 
that they will perform best in the upcoming meets 
including the University Athletic Association 
Championships at Washington University in St. 
Louis on October 22nd.
Only one home dual meet remains this year. The 
Tartan runners will host Thiel and Robert Morris 
this Saturday. By winning these next two meets, 
the dual meet record will stand at 98; just missing 
the heralded 100 mark by two wins. After that the 
Tartans will sharpen their talents and prepare for 
the UAA meet.
The men will return for the Presidents Athletic 
Conference Championships which Meckley 
predicts will be another victory.
However, Meckle/s ultimate goal is the National 
Championships on November 19th. Last year, the 
team placed an outstanding 9th in the nation. 
Meckley thinks they can do better. We have a 
stronger, healthier team this year, with more 
potential still to come, he says.

CHICAGO  The Carnegie 
Mellon Soccer season is halfway 
through in terms of games 
remaining, but they have not 
reached their mid-season form 
yet. This was evident against the 
University of Chicago where the 
Tartans were the better team but 
had to settle for a 1-1 tie.
Carnegie Mellon had many 
good drives, but when the time 
came for a crucial centering pass, 
there was no forward present to 
put the ball through the net.
The team played on a wet 
Chicago field marked by rain 
throughout the game. This 
caused the ball to skip off the 
slick field at unpredictable 
angles.
The majority of the first half 
saw CMUs offense handling the 
ball, but they never had a chance 
to test Chicagos goalie. The one 
time they did, ten minutes into 
the first half, Young Kang kicked 
a low, angled shot that was 
deflected to the right by a diving 
effort from the Maroon goalie.
With five minutes left in the 
half, Kang fed to Eddie Park on 
his right who shot the ball just 
over the left post. After that shot, 
Chicago picked up their game 
slightly and put some pressure 
on CMU.
But the Maroons could not get 
past freshman Delon Mollett who 
constantly broke up many of 
Chicagos offensive drives.
Tartan Head Coach Nick 
Gaudioso was unhappy with the 
teams first half performance and 
let them know it during the break. 
However, the teams play did not 
improve as they looked dejected 
and slower in the second half.
There were openings for the 
CMU offense in the second half,
but there was no support when 
the wings centered their passes^ 
CMU had a great opportunity $ 
score when forward Eddie Pa$ 
took the ball, eluded a couple jg* 
defenders and shot. Tftfe 
goalkeeper blocked the ball but 
could not hang on to it and Park 
had a second chance. He angled 
the shot to the left of the net that 
the keeper managed to deflect.
The Tartans best chance to 
score came on an indirect kick. 
Sophomore Chris Kasabsach took 
the kick and tapped it slightly. 
This caused the Chicago defense 
to freeze momentarily while Park 
came in and blasted a beautiful 
shot past everyone which struck 
the bottom of the top post but did 
not go in. A defender recover^ 
and kicked the ball away befo}^ 
it trickled in to score.
The game then went into two 51- 
minute overtime periods. CMU 
wasted no time as Kang took^a 
long pass from midfield anj| 
appeared to have scored when he 
chipped it over the goalies heat|. 
But the referee made a late caj 
saying that Kang was offsidj 
and the goal did not count.
Two minutes later, Chicago 
scored on a shot that Tartan goal 
keeper Glenn Hoogerwerf rea3 
all the way, however, a Chicago 
player deflected the ball pasjt 
Hoogerwerf for the score.
The Tartans tied the game wi$> 
2 minutes left in the 2nd ai^ 
final period when Delon Molleflt 
scored; Justin Pizzella got tlie 
assists.
Rounding up the other games 
CMU had this week; they beat 
Case Western Reserve 5-4 op 
Wednesday but lost to Emory 1- 
0. Emory is ranked in the top 20 
and the Tartans played them 
tough, losing on a penalty kick. 
Carnegie Mellons record is now 
4-3-1.

NEW YORK - After losing its 
first three tournament matches, 
the Carnegie Mellon womens 
volleyball team pulled them
selves together and came out of 
the University Athletic Associa
tion (UAA) Volleyball Round 
Robin with a tournament record 
of 4-3.
The outcome of the tourna
ment, held at New York Univer
sity, determined the seeding for 
the UAA Volleyball Champion
ship Tournament, which will be 
held at Carnegie Mellon on Octo
ber 29 and 30.
Last year, the Lady Tartans 
finished third at the champion
ship tournament.
Carnegie Mellon did not win 
its first game until ten hours after 
they had arrived on Friday, suf
fering seven straight losses to 
the top three UAA teams. Only a 
turnaround against Brandeis 
University saved the team from 
what looked to be an embarrass
ing weekend.
The Lady Tartans first oppo
nents of the day were the Lady 
Yellowjackets of the University 
of Rochester (UR). CMU came 
out strong, capitalizing on 
Rochesters errors. However, four 
points served by URs Diane 
Ulatowski tied the game at 11, 
and gave the Lady Yellowjackets 
the spark they needed to win the 
game, 15-12.
The win caused the Lady Tar
tans to completely lose confi
dence. Three UR servers earned 
15 points and the victory, 15-1.
Sophomore Cindy Peperak and 
junior Lynn Truskie led CMU 
offensively with 4 and 3 kills in 
the match, respectively.
Carnegie Mellon did not fare 
much better against the host 
team, NYU.
break Carnegie Mellon needed. 
A strong rotation with seven 
consecutive Lady Tartans scor
ing put them ahead of the Lady 
Judges, 9-5. For the first time in 
the tournament, the team looked 
and played like a team. From 
that point on, the Lady Tartans 
refused to lose another game at 
NYU. They fought off the tough 
Lady Judges to take the next two 
games, 15-13, 15-12.
Hanak and Shumaker were the 
keys to the Carnegie Mellon of
fense, combining for 27 of the 
teams 57 total kills.
Coming off of this win, the Lady 
Tartans were ready for 
Saturdays matches against 
Emory, Chicago and Case West
ern Reserve Universities.
Carnegie Mellons first game 
against Emory was the only game 
of the day that the Lady Tartans 
would win by more than 10 points. 
They made quick work of the 
Lady Eagles, beating them 15-4.
The second game saw a hardplaying Emory team. Despite los
ing every game it had played in 
the tournament, they almost beat 
the Lady Tartans. The score was 
11-4 in favor of CMU when Emory 
started slowly adding points due 
to CMU miscues. The Eagles tied 
the game at 14, but two serves by 
Peperak clinched it, 16-14.
The team recorded 25 kills, 7 
serving aces and 9 solo blocks for 
the match.
The University of Chicago 
Maroons proved to be Carnegie 
Mellons toughest competition of 
the day. In the first game, Pep
erak served 7 consecutive points 
to give the Lady Tartans an early 
7-1 lead. Chicago answered with 
four points to bring to score to 7- 
5. The score was 11-10 in favor of 
CMU when the Lady Maroons 
put four more points on the board. 
At 14-14, Chicago called time out, 
continued on page L15Ladies of Washington & Jefferson last week in Skibo Gym.

Field Hockey splits two
By SHAFI KAHN
Tartan Staffwriter
The Lady Tartans Field Hockey team traveled to Washington 
& Jefferson where they prevailed, 1-0. Although this was a close 
game, Carnegie Mellon was in control most of the game, domi
nating on offense and shots on goal.
The winning score came late in the first half when Tammy 
Willis put the ball through a pile of players and the goalie.
The teams second game last week was not as successful. They 
faced Juniata and were shut out, 8-0.
The Tartans did not play badly; Juniata just played a superb 
game. Juniatas offense was simply too overpowering as they 
constantly put tremendous pressure on Carnegie Mellon goalie 
Andi Trump, who came up with 31 saves.
The CMU offense never got to the 20 yard-line of Juniata until 
late in the game when they managed two shots on goal.
The teams record in the University Athletic Conference is 2- 
2 and they face three big games this week against Chatham on 
Sunday, Hiram on Wednesday, and Washington & Jefferson on 
Friday. All of these games will be played at Chatham College.
Baseball Tartans continue their roller coaster season
By JUDY GROSSMAN
Tartan Staffwriter
Lately, it seems like CMUs 
baseball club has been battling 
itself more than its opponents. 
The Tartans have had an up and 
down season. High-scoring games 
and multiple miscues have put 
the Tartans several games below 
the .500 mark.
Yet their four wins are three 
better than last year, when CMU 
managed to win just one game 
during both fall and spring sea
sons. The prior year was winless 
for the Tartans, and it appears 
that the team has indeed come a 
long way.
Monday, however, things did
not go the way the Tartans would 
have liked. The club was sched
uled to take on Duquesne at 
home, but not enough Tartan 
players showed up, and CMU had 
to forfeit the game.
Wednesday, the Tartans re
grouped to beat Penn State (New 
Kensington), 12-5. It was a come 
from behind victory for CMU. 
They spotted Penn State a 5-1 
lead after five innings of play and 
were down 5-4 through six.
But the bounce-back Tartans 
refused to be beaten. They scored 
two more runs to take a 6-5 lead, 
and then in the seventh inning, 
with the bases loaded, first-baseman Perry Pierce laid down a 
perfect suicide squeeze bunt,
scoring Moose Shalrfrom third 
base.
All of a sudden, in the sixth 
and seventh innings, we started 
to wake up, said Pierce. We ha< 
a couple of bungled plays on of 
fense during earlier innings, anil 
made a few early errors, but we 
managed to hang in there.
The Tartans hung in, and went 
on to score four runs in the sew' 
enth inning, and Penn State was 
unable to come back. It was 
much-needed victory for CMU. I( 
put the Tartans at 3-5 with just 
two games left in their season.
The team was to play at Penii 
State-New Kensington on Sun
day, but was rained out. The game 
will be made up this week.

More NFL previews...
Vikings to win Central
By DAVE BRILL
Tartan Staffwriter
The third in a series 
previewing this year's NFL. 
This week: the National 
Football Conference (NFC) 
Central Division.
Minnesota Vikings: After 
an impressive run in the 
playoffs, including two big 
wins against New Orleans and 
San Francisco, the Vikings are 
ready to take the division. 
Whether Wade Wilson or 
Tommy Kramer takes the 
position, the Vikings will be 
well represented at 
quarterback.
tougher, which is bad news 
considering how weak the 
secondary is.
With an easy division, the 
Bears will finish second behind 
the Vikings and make the 
playoffs as a wild card.
Detroit Lions: The Lions 
have gotten worse each of the 
last three seasons. If coach 
Daryl Rogers cannot reverse 
this pattern, this may be his 
last season in Detroit.
First round draft pick Bemie 
Blades will help tighten up 
the Lions secondary.
The Lions have a lot riding 
on first round draft pick Reggie 
Rogers. Both Rogers and the 
defense have to play well if the
All-Pro wide receiver 
Anthony Carter excelled in the 
playoffs and will draw double 
coverage which will open up 
the defense for other receivers.
The Vikings main strength 
lies in their defense. All-Pro 
safety Joey Browner leads a 
talented secondary that makes 
the Vikings tough. The 
defensive line led by All-Pro 
Cris Doleman, rivals that of 
the Bears.
With all these pieces in place, 
the Vikings are on their way to 
dethroning the Bears and 
winning the division title.
Chicago Bears: The loss of 
Walter Payton, Wilbur 
Marshall and Willie Gault will 
severely hurt the Bears. 
Quarterback Jim McMahon 
must stay healthy in order for 
Chicago to win the key games.
The Bears have several holes 
on offense and look for running 
back Neal Anderson to become 
the focus of the Chicago ground 
attack.
The loss of William The 
Refrigerator Perry and 
Wilbur Marshall will slow 
down a once fierce pass rush. 
This poor pass rush will make 
the secondarys job even
Lions are to be competitive.
Their weak schedule will 
give Detroit a chance to win 5 
or 6 games, but that will not 
be enough to save their coach.
Tampa Bay Buccaneers: 
The main problem for the Bucs 
is that quarterback Vinny 
Testaverde has no wide 
recievers. Ranked 27th last 
year in total offense, the Bucs 
need to establish a running 
game and strengthen their 
offensive line.
Without a speedy receiver 
and a running game, defenses 
will key on the pass and 
Testaverde will be in for many 
long afternoons.
Green Bay Packers: 
Coach Lindy Infante is a smart 
offensive coach and with Marc 
Wilson at quarterback, the 
Packers should improve their 
22nd ranked offense from last 
year. Rookie wide receiver 
Sterling Sharpe looks fast and 
should contribute.
If last years first round pick 
Brent Fullwood can play to 
his potential, the Packers will 
have some offensive punch. 
But, unless quarterback Marc 
Wilson has a big year, the 
Packers will finish last.
After piloting the Bucs to their best season in years...
Syd Thrift could be through as Pirate GM
By BRIAN DEAN
Tartan Staffwriter
Last Tuesday, the Pittsburgh 
Pirates clinched 2nd place in the 
National League East by 
defeating the St. Louis Cardinals 
here at Three Rivers Stadium. It 
was the teams best finish since 
1983 when they finished in 
second. Much of this amazing 
turnaround has been attributed 
to the outstanding efforts of field 
manager Jim Leyland, and 
General Manager Syd Thrift. 
Going into the final home game 
of the 1988 season on Wednesday, 
the attitude was indeed jovial.
However, that joviality has 
been overshadowed by therecent 
controversy and rumors over the 
possiblefiringofThrift. Recently, 
Carl Barger, President of the 
Pirates, has said that there is a 
distinct possibility that Thrift 
will be fired next week.
The controversy over Thrifts 
possiblefiring stems from Barger 
andDouglas Danforth, Chairman 
of the Board, hearing the recent 
rumors that Syd Thrift was a 
candidate for the National 
League presidency, and for the 
San Diego Padres presidency. 
These rumors have caused 
resentment and irritation 
between Barger, Danforth and 
Thrift. This centers around 
Thrifts inability, according to 
Barger, to be a team player.
Apparently, Barger and 
Danforth cannot tolerate Thrifts 
alleged career aspirations. 
Although the presidency of the 
N.L. and even the presidency of 
the San Diego Padres are only 
rumors, Barger asserts that 
divisiveness within his 
organization will notbe tolerated.
There have been rumors 
circulating in the Pittsburgh 
media that have indicated that 
Thrift was making player 
acquisitions and key decisions 
concerning the team without the 
consultation of the board of 
directors.
However, in the Post-Gazette 
interview, Barger asserted that 
the difficulties with Thrift did 
not stem from his 1988 mid
season acquisition of Glenn 
Wilson, LaPoint and Redus, who 
are potential free agents, and 
infielder Ken Oberkfel, who has 
a contract for next year. Barger 
claims that while Thrift is very 
knowledgeable about baseball, 
his problems stem from Thrifts 
other duties as GM.
One cannot be sure of what 
Barger means in his 
dissatisfaction with Thrifts 
performance as GM. But, in
retrospect, one must look at the 
overall ability and performance 
of Syd Thrift as the General 
Manager of the Pirates.
Thrift brings over 27 years of 
professional baseball experience 
to the Pirates, including 11 years 
(1957-67) with Pittsburgh as a 
scouting 
supervisor and 
spring training 
instructor. In 
this period,
Thrift helped 
sign players 
who would go on 
to win two 
World Series 
and six division 
titles in the 
1970s.
Since his 
appointment to 
head baseball 
operations for Syd Thrift as pictured in the 
the Pirates in 1988 Pirate Press Guide. 
November of 1985, Thrift made 
some very obvious changes that 
changed the direction that the 
Pittsburgh Pirates have taken 
since 1985. Much of the 
improvement of the Pirates can 
be attributed to Thrifts
acquisition of pitchers Doug 
Drabek, Brian Fisher, Jim Gott 
and Jeff Robinson. Further, it 
was Thrift who recommended 
that the Pirates sign Bobby 
Bonilla after he went unsigned. 
Bonilla started at third base in 
the 1988 All-Star Game.
Thrift is also 
responsible for 
what several 
writers have 
called the single 
best trade in the 
1980s. OnApril 
1, 1987, Thrift 
traded catcher 
Tony Pena to 
the St. Louis 
Cardinals for 
0 u tfi elder 
Andy Van 
Slyke, Pitcher 
Mike Dunne 
and catcher 
M i k 
Van Slyke
e
LaValliere. Van Slyke is 
currently 3rd in RBIs and 1st in 
triples in the National League, 
and LaValliere was voted the 
1987 gold glove for catcher.
Thrift has made many 
instrumental trades and is
always searching for ways to 
improve the overall status of the 
organization. Scouting at all 
levels, Thrift arms the Pirates 
with comprehensive data on 
amateurs as well as professional 
players. Developing a specific 
year-round conditioningprogram 
designed for each players body 
type and baseball needs is the 
result of Thrifts fresh new 
concepts.
One may speculate the 
direction that the Pirates may 
take if Syd Thrift is fired. A new 
era oP'hardball is definitely here, 
however, could it be that this era 
will be turned topsy-turvey by 
internal divisiveness as 
President Carl Barger put it.
Barger has gained his 
recognition in Pittsburgh for his 
uniqueplan thatkeptthePirates 
here.
This weekissignificantforthe 
Pittsburgh Pirates. Carl Barger 
has said that management has 
not made the decision to fire 
Thrift yet. That decision, and 
Thrifts inability to be a part of 
the team will be discussed by 
the board of directors in the 
coming week.

Hanak and Peperak lead 
spikers at UAA Tournament
continued from page Lll
but that failed to break the con
centration of the Lady Tartans, 
who went on to win, 16-14.
The second game started with 
five quick points served by 
Chicagos Kathy Atwood, two of 
which were serving aces. With 
the score 10-4 in Chicagos favor, 
Shumaker came up to the serv
ing line and exploded for 6 points 
to tie the game at 10. After this 
point, the lead changed hands 6 
times before Carnegie Mellon 
won 17-15.
Hanak led the Lady Tartans 
with 9 kills, while Peperak and 
junior Kris Loh had 5 apiece. 
Hanak, Peperak and Shumaker 
each had 3 serving aces. Defen
sively, Peperak had 3 solo blocks 
and Loh recorded 6 digs.
CMUs last match of the round 
robin was against winless Case 
Western Reserve. The Lady Tar
tans covered the court better than 
they had in previous matches,
but forcing plays that werent; 
there and service errors allowed^ 
Case to score 11 points before 
Carnegie Mellon took the game, 
15-11.
The second game was all Car
negie Mellon. After the first rota
tion, the score was 8-2. CMUs 
Truskie served 6 consecutive 
points, and the win was sealed, 
15-6. Team movement and cov-l 
erage of the court were excellent.!
Offensive leaders for the Lady' 
Tartans were Hanak with 5 kills,- 
and freshman Debra Perry with' 
4. Perry also had 3 serving aces.1
Defensively, Peperak recorded; 
6 solo blocks, and, along with, 
Hanak and Shumaker, had 5! 
block assists.
Last week started well for the 
Lady Tartans, who won matches 
against Presidents Athletic 
Conference rivals, Washington 
& Jefferson (3-2) and Thiel (2-0). 
These victories improve the 
teams PAC record to 2-1.

"To be a poet is to have a soul so quick to discern 
that no shade of quality escapes it, 
and so quick to feel that discernment is but a hand 
playing with finely ordered variety 
on the chords of emotion
a soul in which knowledge passes instantaneously into feeling,
and feeling flashes back as a new organ of knowledge."

Editors Note:
This is the time. And this is the record of the time.
Laurie Anderson
I like the word perpetuate; I also like the word lime, but for a completely different reason.
Since high school'the word antidisestablishmentarianism has seemed paradoxical to me.
Living is. But no one has proved that yet. "We re looking for a few gcxxl men" The Marines.
One can certainly perpetuate time, and therefore time can be perpetuated. But this is mere hearsay.
We live only on assumptions, so make some.
Were looking for a few good people. We know that they exist. Weve witnessed it. We've seen them 
We know you. It's your time. Youre living it, and therefore you create it. You art'it. If youre a 
writer and you dont publish, you dont exist.
So BE. Submit your work. Well do the rest.

Adirondack Princesses
The four fat women did not sleep 
with us in the main house 
that Fourth of July weekend.
Instead they spent the nights
in Great-Grandmothers cabin
pushed together by the cedars
like the two double beds they shared.
Spending the afternoons
gathered around the fireplace
listening to soup simmer
on the cast-iron stove, they laughed
when we came in from icy-blue
bathing and swimming in that northern lake.
On the porch wed sit brushing the day
from our hair like mothers combing
knotsfinding bits of grey
like cats whiskers. Watching
early evening, and the man who sculled
guideboats past the island
with a princess in the bow
too far from shore
to swim, unable to paddle,
we feared the shortening days,
the nights wed spend under down.
When she and I took the canoe
early last morning past the furthest
inlet, fly fishing for trout,
the water was so empty
we could almost reach
in for the fish, see them swallow
the line. At breakfast
phrases just out of mind
melted on our tongues
with the trout and the fat
womens gingerbread. After dishes
done with salt in the porcelain sink
we waved from the boat
at the four women on the dock
the lake kissing their toes,
their blanched ankles.

easing into corporate life 
at a quarter to eleven, 
what do you mean to me? 
secure in your twenty-oneness 
and 35K a year, 
innocent amble of sweetness, 
you dont take risks.
and why do i dive into such a dark corner 
for you
after all i have been through?
what you may never know
but the simplest ache does exist for you
ive watched you learn it.
you dont take risks.
your higher souls blood hasnt been spilt
in so many lifetimes and i have seen
tears in your eyes i wanted so much
for you to learn again
where they come from in this life
and last time, too.
you dont take risks.
good breeding and quiet mindless dignity 
hold you softly 
in their reserved, loving arms, 
justification for higher education: 
home on weekends to wash the car
i know how it goes but i don't understand 
why i have to be a risk.

Come dance with me."
Brian watched her. She was happy, she was drunk, she was 
wonderful. Outside is America.
Im going for a walk."
Why?"
Outside is America.
Because I feel like it." He smiled, trying to make it look like 
he was covering deeper emoUon. but he was empty.
What did you see?" asked Janie.
Sometimes Brian thought Janie consciously tried to be 
confusing. What are you talking about?"
When you left the party Saturday. What did you see?"
Brian ran his palm across the stubble on his cheek. Noth
ing. Nothing but a train that never came. He had stood on the 
bridge for two hours after the whistle had reflected off of the grey 
clouds of two A.M. Eventually, he had to leave. He thought that 
he could stand all night, waiting for a train. He had to see a 
train, here and now. while the party blundered on stupidly 
behind him into the night. He thought of Janie, still dancing, on 
and on. He closed his eyes as he coughed, then spit. He had to 
leave.
I think its getting cold." said Janie. But I like the wind.
Let's smoke," said Brian, handing her a cigarette. They 
walked along a fence, watching the river. A barge pushed 
upstream and smokestacks stood like long abandoned sentries, 
dwarfed by the hills behind them. The city settled and shifted 
like an old house on a failing foundation, and all around them 
they felt the creaks and groans. The river was hard and me
chanical beneath the darkening hills that surrounded the city.
Is it carrying coal?" asked Janie, pointing to the barge.
Yeah, I think so." said Brian. He turned his back to the 
river. Let's walk."
Can we wait a second?" asked Janie. Youre not in a 
hurry?"
No. never." he said. 1 can wait." The wind blew up the
river at her and he watched it play with her hair. She danced 
without moving, danced to the sun and the wind and the barge 
on the black water.
There's so much here," she said, and it's so empty."
Brian looked back down the rail for a train.
I'm glad you keep looking back," said Janie. I always 
forget."
They sneak up on you sometimes." said Brian. Looking 
back becomes a habit after a while."
1 guess thats whats different about us." she said. Brian 
cleared his throat. He felt an uneasy silence between them as 
they crossed the tracks and headed into the city. As they 
merged with streets and buildings and stores, he felt apart from 
the people waiting at eveiy corner for busses that stopped at 
regular intervals and shuffled people on and off with a sporadic 
rhythm. That's not the difference, he thought. I don't know 
what it is, but that's not it.
"What a long strange trip it's been," said Brian.
Better footnote that." Janie criticized. "Don't rape someone 
elses lyrics. You can do better than that."
The city parted in front of them and crashed together be
hind. and they moved through it like the followers of Moses. 
Brian's steps felt the spaces between the Ues, even on flat
pavement.
You know, youre the only person I'd have wanted to do this 
with." He looked at his feet.
Janie swung her arms and looked toward the tops of build
ings. Were so lucky," she said, to not have anything."
Brian looked around him, looked at the grainy soot that 
belched from busses and delivery trucks. It gathered and stuck 
on store windows, and Brian watched Janie's reflecUon in them 
as his feet tread pavement and metal grates. What do you see in 
her. he asked again as Janie's reflecUon faded under a coaUng of 
thick black soot.

Train 
Dance
William N. Blake
They tramped. The rusted tracks at either side of Brian's 
worn feet ribboned outward in front and behind, connecting him 
to the world, and Janie walked beside him between the rails.
The city swirled around them in a dazed rush hour madness as 
they lifted their faces to the sun and watched it duck under 
bridges, skim the water, then burst upwards again. Steel mills 
seemed to crumble under their gaze, and they walked below 
bridges and buildings that droned with life, walked on tracks be
side green water that smelled of death.
Of course," said Brian, you cant have one without the 
other." He tripped on the tie and laughed. Damn."
Under the overpass they could hear the beat of tires on 
suspended pavement, a constant, erosion, a relationship of 
mutual destruction. He looked and smiled when Janie waved to 
a State Trooper who had slowed down to look at them.
Were unreachable," he said. The freeway sighed and fell 
silent for a moment, and neither one spoke.
A truck slid by. 1 like it that way." she said.
They tried balancing on each rail, holding hands. Three 
steps later, they were back walking between the rails, with their 
hands in their pockets.
If we could walk that way, it would be much easier," he said.
That only works in the movies."
The track led them over a small bridge. Above them was the 
constant beat of the overpass; below, cars sat on cobblestone 
and broken glass waiting for lights.
I like this place." said Brian. He looked up at the overpass, 
^at the track, then down at the cars below him: lines crossing 
without meeting. Do you want a cigarette?"
Let's smoke mine this time."
Brian turned his back to the wind and cupped his hands 
around his lighter.
The sky is so clear." she said, and we have to build things 
to break it up and slice through it. and then we call both things 
beautiful. Technology tries so hard to make life simple. Its kind 
of arrogant, 1 think. Janie ran her hand through her hair. Do 
you still have that soda? Im thirsty.
Their hands touched as he handed the can to her. He 
wanted to kiss her. She drank and handed it back.
It's warm. she said, but not too bad.
Not long ago Janie had posed elusively above the empty din 
of McKeesport. She was from the west, and brought it all with 
her to this place. They had stood at the brink of the valley, 
overlooking all of Braddock and McKeesport from a point high 
above it all. The power line swung down in a low arc from the 
tower behind them into the valley below where it was lost amid 
the tanks and boilers, and the grass under their feet was coarse 
and rutted with tractor marks. Janie had seemed to float above 
the water, the mills, the bridges. Brian felt himself looking up, 
always looking up. even here with so much below him. He looked 
up at Janie as her shaded eyes took in the scene serenely. Brian 
put his hands to his forehead and squinted to block the sun.
They had been taking pictures all day. but by the time they 
had come to this hill Brian had already rewound the last roll of 
film and placed it in its plastic case. Inside, images of Janie on 
corroded metal had been formed where light met plastic. Brian 
imagined the darkroom chemicals dissolving the surface of the 
film, slowly tearing apart the dark spaces and leaving darkness 
where light had struck. He fondled the case in his pocket and 
realized that there was nothing inside but treated plastic: 
nothing until he made it into something. He thought of opening 
the roll here, tearing it out of its shell that he might expose the 
fragile images right now. to see them before they became what he 
wanted them to be. But he knew that in doing so he would only

---------------------------------------------------

expose celluloid for celluloid. It was all treated plastic and 
grainy negative images.
"I'd really like a picture of this," said Janie, taking in the 
world.
Brian shrugged. I wish we would have started here. Maybe 
we can come back."
Janie turned from the scene, back towards the path leading 
to Brians car. No. it doesnt matter. There's lots of places like 
this. More than I care to deal with."
Brian had looked hard into the sun before he followed her. 
It's too bad." he said. If only we had known earlier."
Janie closed her eyes and let the wind make her hair and
jacket swirl and flap behind her.
They were closer now to the ground than they had been that
day on the hill. Uneven brick walls and hazy exhaust sur
rounded them, and Brian's feet tread the ties that stretched to 
parallel infinities. The city above him looked like the rusting 
body of an old Cadillac, the newer buildings a patch job. a new 
hood ornament for the old clunker; but from where Janie and 
Brian stood they could see the heart of the damage. The engine 
is shot, thought Brian, don't buy it.
The train startled them. Brian looked back down the rail, 
towards Philadelphia. He had never been there. This is Pitts
burgh. he thought. All of my twenty-one years of Pittsburgh, 
now walking on this rail. All that he had ever been had accumu
lated to this, and Janie walked beside him and her hair filtered 
the sun. The train was silent as it rounded the next bend and 
disappeared through a hole in the city.
The sun was lower now. and they watched as it burned 
through steam rising from a smokestack. Cars flashed in the 
sun as they passed. Cars full of constipated American dreams, 
thought Brian, rushing home to burst out all over the dining 
room floor.
Theres so much happening here, said Janie. So much 
dying, and so much living. It's like formica-covered rust." This 
made Brian smile, made him wish that he could know Japie 
because he loved her. At times he could almost believe that he 
did know her.
I like that. Thats a really good image.
Janie blew smoke into the wind, smiled.
Images are what you make of them," she said.
At times she seemed exposed to him; but then she would 
throw him off, tear apart his understanding by feeding him new 
information that didnt quite fit in with his image of her. To 
Brian, trying to understand Janie was like ripping the film right 
out of the camera to see a picture just taken. Some girls were 
Polaroid instamatic. snapshots, but not Janie. You could see in 
her what you wanted to see. enlarge it. filter it. make it into 
something else. But always there was the graininess that 
reminded him that it was all just a manipulated image, more him 
than her. What do you see in her. he asked himself. What do 
you see in her?
They passed a switch and a third track arched out and away 
from them. Rust flaked and curled off of the hard metal and the 
ties were rotted and broken. Brian watched it as they walked.
1 think that track is a lot safer to walk on." said Janie.
Yeah." said Brian, but 1 don't think thats where we want to go.'
Last weekend was dry and left green scum where water once 
lay. Cigarette smoke scorched Brian's lungs and he didnt feel 
drunk at all. The party ebbed and flowed like the tide, and Janie 
would never stop dancing. Tension flowed from Brians body 
without reception. Alone in a crowd, he thought, and felt 
overwhelmingly mediocre for thinking it. And through the walls 
we hear the city groan wailed the music, though nobody heard 
it. Outside is America. Janie danced his way. never stopping.

The Carnegies four museums rep
resent the disciplines that Andrew 
Carnegie believed would appeal to 
all people and open up cultural and 
educational opportunities: art, 
science, music and literature  the 
Noble Quartet. He realized this 
vision in the Carnegies four compo
nents: The Museum of Art, The 
Museum of Natural History, The 
Music Hall, and the Library of Pitts
burgh.
The Museum of Art focuses on 
what Carnegie called Old Masters of 
Tomorrow  paintings after 1896. 
The collection includes a good 
selection of Impressionist and PostImpressionist paintings by artists 
such as Monet, Matisse, Degas, 
Warhol, de Kooning, and Cassatt.
The Hall of Sculpture is designed 
after the Temple of Athena in 
Athens, and was made with Pentelic 
marble taken from the same Greek 
quarries which supplied marble for 
the Parthenon in the 5th Century 
B.C. The Hall of Architecture, based 
on the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus, 
one of the 7 wonders of the ancient 
world, contains casts of world mas
terpieces in architecture.
The triennial 1988 CARNEGIE INTER

special international advisory commit

Kiefer, Elizabeth Murray, Susan 
Rothenberg, Robert Ryman, Cy 
Twombly, and Andy Warhol. The

styles and of media, including paint
ings. sculpture, photography and 
video. Some pieces will be displayed 
for the first time or were specially 
created for the Exhibition.

Revolutionary Artists Lecture Series 
will discuss how revolutionary artists 
Caravaggio. Manet and Picasso chal
lenged the art world with their 
startling visions. "The Legacy of

forces shaping contemporary art. The

The South Side of Pittsburgh 
is a neighborhood with an 
industrial past and an 
artistically diverse future 
with art galleries, specialty 
shops and exceptional 
restaurants bringing this 
historic neighborhood con
siderable recognition.
Located on East Carson 
Street between 10th and 
23rd Streets, the South Side 
is also a neighborhood in 
ethnic contrasts. Although it 
maintains much of its 
Eastern European heritage 
from when it was called 
Birmingham, the occupants 
of the neighborhood are 
shifting from the families of 
steelworkers to the restau
rant, and store workers and 
artists who are making this 
once nearly defunct com
munity thrive again.
In the fall of 1984, the South 
Side was one of seven com
mercial areas to receive the 
national register historic 
designation as a national 
main street center. Since 
then, it has experienced a 
resurgence in the openings 
of many galleries, shops and 
restaurants. Following is a 
list of the most notable 
places on the South Side:
Pictured here is the 
Birmingham Mural in 
South Side.

MARIOS SOUTH SIDE SA
LOON and BLUE LOUS BAR 
AND GRILL are adjoining es
tablishments on 1514 E.

crowded, it will be recom
mended that you dine at Blue 
Lous. However, this is not a 
wise idea as the menu at Blue 
Lous is exactly the same as 
Marios except for the prices 
being about $2 higher. Eat at 
Marios no matter what the wait 
and then go to Blue Lous for 
drinks afterwards. The pasta at 
Marios is homemade and you 
can get yards of beer (beer in a 
three foot tall glass), fishbowls 
of beer and other drinks in 
odd-shaped glassware. If you 
get a yard of beer, dont get out 
of control and break the glass. 
Itll cost you $35. Food prices 
are much more moderate, most 
dinners are under $10 and 
include salad and garlic bread.

really cheap.

on the inside, there is weekly 
entertainment and international 
specialty food at moderate 
prices in an intimate, casual 
setting.
To get to the South Side, take 
the 54C Pat bus from the 
corner of Fifth Ave. and N.
Craig Street or take the $7 cab 
ride from CMU. Its about 15 
minutes from campus.

 "Pittsburgh- nightlife. -
Some would call it an 
oxymoron, but it aint 
necessarily so. You just 
have to know where to 
look. Unfortunately, you 
often have to be 21 as 
well  liquor laws are 
enforced, so prepare to be 
carded at the door of just 
about any bar you plan 
to visit. Pittsburgh offers 
the basic types, of bars: 
clubs for live music and 
dancing, fern bars, meat 
markets, neighborhood 
taverns, and dives (also 
known as college bars).
To acquaint you with 
them, here is a fairly 
comprehensive list of 
such establishments 
within the CMU area.
8nsgg3e asee
Murray Street Cafe (for
merly Bar One). 1720 Murray 
Ave
Popular dramat hangout.
Small, well-lit, and inexpen
sive. Bar in front, booths and 
tables in back. Standard bar & 
grill fare  sandwiches, 
burgers, salads. Not being a 
meat market earns it bonus 
points. ,'
Squirrel Hill Cafe (aka The
Cage). 5802 Forbes Avenue. 
Kind of dirty, noisy, fairly 
crowded but customer turn
over is quick so you can 
always get a table. Food is 
greasy but edible. Tuesdays 
and Thursdays are Import 
Nights : $1.25 per bottle. Too 
many Whitney Houston 
soundalikes on the juke box.
ORourkes. 5882 Forbes 
Avenue.
Local bands and Open Stage 
nights weekly. Dark: would be 
romantic if it werent for the 
other patrons, who tend to be 
loud. Daily happy hours (4-6 
pm, 50C drafts). Monday is 
Import Night. Occasional 
Explosive Drink Night livens 
things up even more.
Silkys Saloon. 2701 Murray 
Avenue (beyond Poli's). 
Up-and-coming place. Big, 
with substandard loft and DJ 
who spins a random mixture 
of top-40, mainstream dance 
and classic tracks. Foozball 
table. Decor that will remind 
you of a fraternity- basement 
(minus the teenyboppers.)
ffygygv*- ,fl^
Napolis. 2006 Murray Avenue 
Not really a bar, but worth men
tioning for the incredibly rea
sonable prices on drafts and 6- 
packs to go. Extremely good 
pizza and other Italian fare as 
well.
8amrB8sr3
Docs Place. 5442 Walnut 
Street.
Where to go if youre looking to 
spend a lot of money and have 
your intentions trounced upon. 
Bring your friends: you wont 
be able to sit down, nor hear 
them over the noise, but if 
youre alone youll look like 
youre on the make and nobody 
will let you hit on them.
Women must always go to the 
bathroom in pairs. Redeeming 
qualities are the jukebox and 
complimentary taco bar on 
Fridays.
Balcony. 5520 Walnut Street. 
Yuppie hotspot for good food 
and live jazz. More expensive 
than other places, though not 
unresonable. Get a table by the 
window so you can watch all 
the people stumbling from 
Docs to the parking lot with 
their catches.
Cappys . 5431 Walnut Street. 
Where to take someone youve 
just met at Docs if you want to 
talk to them. Very cozy, laidback atmosphere. Tables 
always available. Friendly 
waitresses who actually remem
ber what drink you ordered. 
Rockin jukebox as well.
Happy hour every Monday - 
Thursday, 5 -7: save 50<* on all 
drinks.
Flirts. 5534 Walnut Street. 
Offensive purple neon sign
* Msidel Vaflet^rkfrfgl tfd nee 
floor. Young women and old 
men. Mirrors everywhere.
You could spend a lot of 
money in the bathroom (and I 
dont just mean on the 
washroom attendants). Nuff 
said.
The Elbow Room. 5744-1/2 
Ellsworth Avenue.
High grease content in food 
doesnt detract from quality. 
Older, sedate crowd. Dining 
Al Fresco in the summer.
Floral wallpaper, comfy 
chairs and brown wrapping 
paper tablecloths (crayons are 
provided) make for a relaxing 
experience.
Harriss Cafe. 5747 
Ellsworth Avenue. 
Indoor/outdoor cafe serving 
fine Greek food. Moderately 
priced. Terrace features porch 
furnitue, candlelight and 
Cinzano umbrellas not unlike 
the ones found in Kiltie (but 
dont let this frighten you.) 
Waitresses are especially fun
 ask for Andrea.
New York, Neiv York. 5801 
Ellsworth Avenue.
Just over a year old, and 
thriving. Primarily a gay bar/ 
restaurant. Sunday brunch 
and nightly piano bar. Classy, 
older clientele.
College Inn. 5851 Ellsworth
Avenue.
Small and low-key, but not 
entirely devoid of merits. 
Good selection of imports. 
Wednesday night is Animal 
Night  $1.50 for Grizzly, 
Moosehead, Elephant (you 
get the idea.) Other nightly 
specials: Tuesday for Michelob, Thursday for Imports C$1 
-1.50), Friday for Mexican 
beer (Corona, etc.) and 
Saturday for Coors,
Dmdem5r
Chiefs. 307 N. Craig Street. 
Preferred watering hole of 
leftists, longhairs and tortured 
intellectuals. Dirt cheap (45<t 
drafts) and heavy on the beerrelated plastic paraphernalia, 
as all proper dives are. A real 
Steppenwolf kind of bar says 
a close friend. Everybody 
must go here at least once.
Luna 
Thirstys 
Mitchells
All within a block of the 
intersection of N. Craig and 
Centre
Rough crowds. Who says 
rednecks dont live in the city? 
Your only excuse for going to 
any of these establishments is 
that you live in Carol Apts., 
have run out of beer and
\kar-neg'-e\,

---------------------------------------------------

nobody will loan you their car.
Graffiti. 4615 Baum Blvd. 
Cafe, Pub and showcase, as 
the ads say. Many fine per
formers are featured here, 
from all genres: rock, old rock, 
folk, funk, new wave, new 
age, reggae, R&B, etc. etc. 
Wednesday nights are comedy 
nights. Also, occasional open 
stage nights.
Electric Banana. 3887 
Bigelow Blvd.
Premiere hard-core/thrash 
joint. You will get hurt on the 
dance floor  make sure your 
Blue Cross is paid up before 
you go.

Youve heard of BosNYWash? 
Welcome to Oakland, the bartroplis. One bar in nine 
locations, all within stumbling 
distance of each other and Pitt. 
Sanctuary and Upstage are 
known for dancing, J. Hannas 
for live music, Hemingways 
and Primantis are more for 
eating, Zeldas and CJs for 
mating. Hemingways is the 
classiest of the lot, and
 features poetry and fiction 
readings in the backroom 
throughout the year.
Original (Os). 3901 Forbes 
Avenue (with all the cops 
milling around outside)
Where to go for -what else? - 
fries. Drinking here, although 
it can be done, is not recom
mended because a) seating is 
difficult to acquire, b) the 
crowds can get ugly, and c) 
the upstairs (Top of the OsO 
has the most painfully loud 
and obtrusive video jukebox 
known to mankind.
SOD . 403 Semple Ave 
(corner Semple and Bates) 
Philip Ds. Further down 
Semple
Fine examples of what a dive is 
supposed to be. Pool tables in 
the back rooms. SOD: Every
body drinks Iron City and yells 
their brains out at the TV, 
which is invariably blaring a 
foot/base/basketball game 
featuring a Pittsburgh team.
PDs: Everybody drinks Iron 
City and talks about foot/base/ 
basketball and what 
Pittsburghs standings are.
PHI (Panther Hollow Inn $ 
hut nobody calls it by this 
name). 4609 Forbes Avenue 
So popular with CMU students, 
it was once suggested that a 
campus phone be installed 
there. Purple Hooters are 
served by the pitcher. Thursday 
is the night to go. Also, many 
CMU profs take their students 
there for lunch.
Bloomfield
Monsours Tavern. S.
Millvale, across the bridge 
Small dance floor and DJ who 
will dedicate Madonna songs to 
the person of your choice. Most 
unusual feature: table howling. 
Go see for yourself.
Pleasure Bar & Restaurant.
4729 Liberty Avenue.
Its not what you think. Very, 
very good Italian food at very 
affordable prices. Daily buffet
& Salad Alley (Im not 
kidding, thats what its called.) 
If theres such a thing as a 
family bar, this must be one.
Penn Cafe. 4104 Penn 
Avenue.
Possibly the best blues bar in 
town. Live bands including 
national touring acts and locals.
Strip District
Metropol Smallman Street 
What every town needs  an 
industrial dance club. Industrial 
not in music but in space 
(housed in an old warehouse: 
lots of exposed pipes and 
ducts, cavernous space). Multi
leveled interior can hold over 
1000 of Pgh.s trendiest. $5.00 
cover on weekends  Thurs
day is the hippest night of the 
week. At least they won't play 
Madonna: if you miss WXXP 
and liked Brazil, youll like this 
place.
The Foundry. 2930 Penn 
Avenue.
WRCTs latest performance 
space for alternative music is
located in an old copper 
smelting foundry. Rest 
assured, the industrial 
ambience has been pre
served. Alternative locals 
and out-of-state bands who 
have never played in Pgh. 
before (due to the lack of 
appropriate spaces) now 
have their chance. Fall 
lineups include Scrawl, 
Cousin It, Weird Paul, Car
sickness and Sink Manhat
tan. All age shows: liquor is 
verboten in or around the 
building. Check posters on 
campus and listen to RCT 
for upcoming events. 
Several artists are currently 
working in the Foundry. 
00k for an opening soon, 
and perhaps even perfomance art later on.
Primantis. 46 18th Street 
(off Penn Avenue)
The original one (Forbes 
Ave. is a branch restaurant). 
Used to be frequented by 
colorful locals with a 
propensity towards vio
lence, but no more. Open 
very late every night. Their 
sandwiches are the best.
Station Square/South 
Side
Chauncys 
Houlihans 
Gandy Dancer Saloon
Freight House Shops,

Corporate pick-up joints. 
Wait til youve graduated

the crawling underbelly of 
yuppiedom.
Marios South Side 
Saloon. 1514 E. Carson 
Street
Talk about yuppie! Con
verted Victorian house in 
gentrified neighborhood. 
Cute menus. Bad music. 
Packed on weekends with 
bombed lawyers. Bizarre 
drink specials (1 lb. margari
tas and such). Main attrac
tion is the Yard of Beer  
drink it and you get another 
one.
Blue Lous. next door to 
Marios.
Everything here is blue. The 
menus, the lighting, the 
napkins, the food, the 
waitresses clothing. Even 
the beer: Labatts Blue. 
Busch. Anything in a blue 
can, whether its drinkable 
or not.

Fear not, there are still 
plenty of activities that 
dont involve alcohol.
 Electric Banana, 
Graffiti and The 
Foundry have all age 
shows. Check The 
Tartan, In Pittsburgh 
and WRCTs Radio 
Calendar for upcom
ing events.
 Laserium at the 
Buhl Planetarium on 
the North Side (Al
legheny Square, next 
to Allegheny Center 
Mall; call 321-4300 or 
check ACME in The 
Tartan for listings.)
 Theater is alive and 
well in town. Check 
the Pittsburgh Public 
Theater (321-9800), 
Pittsburgh 
Playhouse (621- 
4445), Pitt (624-7529), 
City Theater (624- 
7529) and Laurel 
Highlands Regional 
Theater (located, 
oddly enough, in 
Oakland: 781-9198). 
And of course, CMU's 
Drama Dept mainstage and Junior Rep. 
(box office: x2407.)
 Concerts of all types 
are held at the Civic 
Arena, AJ Palumbo 
Center (on Duquesne 
University's campus,) 
Heinz Hall,
Benedum Center, 
Syria Mosque
 Bowling is some
thing everybody 
claims to hate and be 
horrible at, yet ends 
up having fun doing. 
Forward Lanes (5844 
Forward Ave in 
Squirrel Hill, 422- 
5844) and Strand 
Bowling Lanes (3609 
Forbes, above the 
Upstage, 621-6474) are 
the closest to campus.
 Ice skating in 
Schenley Park (422- 
6547) is a perennial 
favorite of CMU 
students. Nighttime 
adults-only sessions 
are held weekly.
 The Carnegie offers a 
wide variety of evening 
lectures on art history 
and related topics. The 
Museum of Arts Film & 
Video series includes 
travel, ait and obscure 
foreign films, often 
featuring a particular 
country or director each 
month, and videos by 
popular artists. Call 622- 
3172 for weekly listings,
622-3212 for films.
 The inclines that run 
from Carson St. to Mt. 
Washington are always 
mentioned, and yeah, it 
sounds kind of dopey 
but it really is an impres
sive view and at night 
you can sneak up on the 
couples necking on the 
overlooks and frighten 
the dickens out of them. 
Also amusing is to take a 
small child to the over
looks, then suddenly 
swoop them up and 
threaten to toss them 
over the edge. Getting 
the sjmall child, however, 
is your problem. 
(Duquesne Incline: 381- 
1665. Monongahela 
Incline: 231-5707.)
 Ritters Diner. The 
perfect end to an evening 
of heavy drinking, the 
perfect beginning to a 
morning of heavy drink
ing, Ritters is always 
appropriate. The omelets 
are cheap, filling and 
yummy, as are the hot 
sandwiches and entrees. 
The place never closes, 
and you're bound to see 
someone you know. 
Avoid the little jukeboxes 
at the booths; though 
cute and nostalgic, they 
are filled with evil 
sounds (top^iO) that will 
render you- mindless and 
make you unknowingly 
drool on your food.

Blvd.)
