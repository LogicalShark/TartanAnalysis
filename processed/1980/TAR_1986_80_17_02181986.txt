Sen. Biden feels power and diplomancy are inseparable
By GAVIN WILLIAMS
Tartan Staffwriter
The topic of Sen. Joseph Bidens (D-Del) Feb. 
14th, Presidents Distinguished Lecture Series 
speech was Terrorism and International 
Politics: New Directions in American Foreign 
Policy, but it was obvious from the start that 
Sen. Biden had other political issues on his 
mind. Bidens began his speech with a discus
sion of why the U.S. has lacked a coherent 
foreign policy and how this was caused, in part, 
by the inevitable changes that occurred after 
the Second World War. He then looked at the 
conflicting foreign policies of the Republicans
and Democrats, both of which he considered 
simplistic and naive. Biden then offered an 
outline of his own foreign policy, which consists 
of setting up two signposts and following four 
main principles. Biden ended his speech with 
a short discussion of world terrorism and how 
the U.S. should deal with the problem.
Sen. Biden, who plans to run for the 1988 
Democratic Presidential nomination, opened his 
speech with a story about a plane he thought 
was being held for him in Boston. It turned out 
the airline (USAir) was under the impression 
they were holding the plane for Senator Ted 
Kennedy, and that if they had known it was for
Biden, would have let it go long before he ar
rived. However, as a candidate for the 
Democratic nomination in 1988, Biden will 
soon be having planes held for him on the 
strength of his own name.
After his opening remarks, Sen. Biden began 
the main part of his speech, which was to center 
more on foreign policy than terrorism, by stating 
that he feels the U.S. has not had a coherent 
foreign policy for at least the past eight or nine 
years. Biden said that in the past three Presiden
tial elections, we have elected two Presidents 
who have had no background or interest in 
foreign policy making. Biden feels that Carter 
and Reagans foreign policy came from two dif
fering perspectives, but that in both cases, they 
were blankslates as far as foreign policy went 
when they entered office. The policies that they 
developed were reactive policies, with dif
ferent reactions by both presidents.
Sen. Biden believes now is the time to make

T. Boon Pickens talks on oil, crisis management
By JACK L. POLLER
Tartan Photography Editor
Hours after making a $200 million bid for 
KN Energies, the chairman and chief executive 
officer of Mesa Petroleum, T. Boone Pickens, 
lectured at Carnegie Mellon University last 
Wednesday. In an unpublicized visit, Pickens 
lectured to the Crisis Management course given 
by Carnegie Mellons Graduate School of In
dustrial Administration.
i want somebody that still
95wants to makemoney Pickens
Pickens, who was introduced as a 
shareholders advocate, founded Mesa in 1964 
and made it the largest independent gas and 
oil company. According to visiting professor 
Gerald Meyers, Crisis Management course in
structor, Pickens detractors consider him a 
rich, powerful exploiter of other peoples under
valued assets for his own personal gain. 
Meyers, former chief executive officer of 
American Motors Corporation, characterized 
Pickens as a highly visible crisis provoker and 
manager, taking great risks and using unor
thodox methods. Although Pickens was invited
to lecture to the Crisis Management course, he 
graciously donated twenty minutes of his time 
to answering questions from members of the 
visiting press.
Pickens, in his opening remarks, said that he 
does not believe he has all the answers. But he
never evaded or refused to answer a question. 
Commenting on his reputation as both a 
shareholders advocate and as someone out for 
his own good, he said both are correct. I dont 
know anybody thats going to go out and put 
up a million dollars, and their best case would 
be to want to break even.
Pickens stated that he had been right in 1982 
and 1983 when he had said that the oil industry7 
must consolidate in order to survive. Although 
he does not believe that he was the cause of 
the industry changes, he thinks that the industry 
is much stronger now than two or three years 
ago.
Had it [the oil industry] been left alone, to 
proceed in the fashion that it was going, that 
would have been a sad day for the industry. I 
think that we could have looked a lot like the 
steel industry. The changes had to be made 
when the cash was available, and the oil in
dustry. is much better off because of the 
changes.
Pickens said that he did not feel lucky about 
his position during the recent drop in oil prices. 
Instead, he feels he analyzed the situation cor
rectly. Relating his history as a commodities 
trader, Pickens stated the fundamental law of 
supply and demand-when a commodity is in 
abundant supply, the price is low, whereas when 
a commodity is rare, the price is high. He said
the reason for the high oil prices was the OPEC 
oil cartel.
He predicted that 13 countries could not 
band together indefinitely, and that the cartel 
would break sometime in the near future, caus
ing oil prices to drop. According to Pickens, the 
oil industry can still turn a profit at a cost of 
sixteen dollars per barrel of oil. At that cost, 
however, the industry cannot look for nev 
sources of oil. Because of this, the number of 
drilling rigs has fallen over 3000 in the last 4 
years.
Pickens predicted that the availability of crudoil would remain fairly constant in the future. 
In order to see prices rise over a short term 
period of five years, the oil cartel must get back 
together and limit production. However, this 
seems quite unlikely to Pickens.
Pickens said that U. S. Steel is going against 
the grain [in purchasing Marathon Oil). People 
are not out trying to acquire oil and gas reserves 
today in a falling market." Whether or not I 
S. Steel made a mistake will be determined in 
the future.
In explaining his strategy, Pickens stated that 
KN Energies is a small company whose business 
is oil transmission in five states. Mesa holds two 
thirds of its reserves in Kansas, KN Energies" 
home base. According to Pickens, Mesa wants

Bidinotto blames Bhopal tragedy on Indias policies
By MOHAN EMBAR
Tartan Contributing Editor
Journalist Robert James Bidinotto argued that 
the Indian governments economic objectives 
and political ideologies created a breeding 
ground for the Bhopal tragedy
The Bhopal tragedy occurred on December 
3, 1984 at 12:45 a.m. when a cloud of methylisocyanate gas leaked from Union Carbides 
Bhopal plant and descended upon the surroun
ding village. Roughly 2000 people were killed 
by the poisonous vapor. Methyl-isocyanate kills 
by weakening the lungs protective membranes. 
The victim then drowns on his body fluids.
Bidinottos main contention was that the In
dian Governments approach to economy is ex
actly the opposite of the Western laissez-faire 
style of capitalism which allows the free market 
to regulate company policies, operation and out
put. He asserted that India instead adopts a 
more socialistic form of economic control in 
which the profit motive is given a lower priority 
than industrial policy. As a result, the govern
ment introduces a coercive element to 
politically approved private industries.
According to Bidinotto, two stances toward 
the economy taken by the Indian Government 
contributed to the worsening of conditions at 
Bhopal. The government's desires for encourag
ing exports over imports and encouraging 
domestic self-sufficiency allowed situations to 
develop in which those who were in contact with 
advanced foreign technology are unable to ful
ly understand its complexity.
He argued that the Indian Government only 
allows industries to set up operations in India 
if their values are consistent with its policy. He 
also alluded to corruption in the government by 
mentioning that bribery and sweetheart deals 
were rampant. He quoted one source as saying 
if you want to start a business in India, you 
have to bribe the right party.
One prerequisite set forth by the government,
claimed Bidinotto, is that eventually Indians 
must he trained to manage, staff and run all 
India-based businesses. To expedite this, 
western culture must be force-fed to Indian 
workers. Bidinotto expressed concern for this 
philosophy and said Bhopal people were 
capable of operating by rote but could not fully 
appreciate concepts such as preventive 
maintenance. He also stated that the unwill
ingness of companies such as IBM and CocaCola to relinquish control over daily operations 
caused them to leave India.
Since the Bhopal plant was shaped by these 
philosophies, Bidinotto said, it was not a child 
of Western Capitalism, but rather an illegitimate 
offspring of Indian policies.
Bidinotto asserted that the government was 
initially receptive toward building the Bhopal 
plant because it saw the need for pesticides in 
a land that was plagued with famine. It had com
plete control over the design and setup of the 
plant. To produce the pesticide, the plant need
ed to dilute with water a concentrated form call
ed Sevin, which could be imported. However, 
he inferred, the logic of industrial policy re
quired the actual manufacturing of Sevin, a 
chemical that never had to be in India in the 
first place.
In 1971, a plant needed to produce one of 
the chemicals needed to make Sevin was built 
in Bhopal. Bidinotto observed that initial pro
blems in running the plant forced a five-year 
shutdown while $1.5 million in modifications 
were made. He also blamed the logic of selfsufficiency as one of the factors leading to the 
storage of methyl-isocyanate in 15,000 gallon 
containers rather than the safer fifty-five-gallon 
drums which were initially used.
According to Bidinotto, one of the turning 
points in the Bhopal operation came during a 
period when the Indian Government gave loans 
to farmers and relieved local pesticide manufac
turers of the obligation to pay sales tax. Since
these manufacturers could now undersell Union 
Carbide by as much as fifty percent, the out
put and profits of the Union Carbide plant fell. 
More highly-skilled people became depress
ed and left. Methyl-isocyanate plant operators 
who previously held college degrees were 
replaced by those with only a high-school educa
tion. In June 1982, Union Carbide inspectors 
from the United States visited the Bhopal plant 
and wrote a critical report of problems with 
the plant. However, repairs were left to the
Robert Janies Bidinotto on the Bhopal Tragedy.
Bhopal plant managers who gave the U.S. their 
assurances that the problems would be rectified.
Bidinotto concluded his lecture with an over
view of the plants condition immediately before 
the gas leak. He listed the five safety devices 
that were supposed to prevent accidents of this 
sort from happening and pointed out that three 
of these devices had been disabled for 
maintenance reasons and the remaining two fail
ed to operate properly when the gas began to 
leak. He also mentioned that workers eyes 
began to tear and the leakage was noticed as 
early as one hour before the cloud escaped, but 
managers opted instead to take their schedul
ed tea break and discuss the problem. The relief 
valve burst an hour later.
Bidinotto answered questions from the au
dience after his talk. When asked if the Indian 
Governments policies had changed after the incident, he spoke positively about Indian Prime 
Minister Rajiv Gandhis plans. However, he expressed doubts that these changes could be im. 
plemented within the existing framework which 
so strongly reflects past ideologies. One au
dience member pointed out that the Union Carbide Plant in West Virginia also had problems 
with chemical leaks. Bidinotto said these pr0. 
blems were due more to minor equipment problems than to the chain of violations which 
led to the Bhopal incident.
Bidinotto was billed as an award-winning 
journalist in flyers which announced the lec
ture. In 1985, he received the Mencken Award 
in Journalism by the Free Press Association for 
Best Features Story, Essay, or Review. The Free 
Press Association is an organization of jour
nalists and broadcasters concerned with First 
Amendment questions.
Last Fridays one-hour lecture, entitled 
Bhopal: The Real Cause, was the second of five 
lectures sponsored by the CMU Objectivist 
Club. The other four are videotaped. It was 
presented in Adamson Wing at 8 p.m. and 
twenty-nine people attended. In her introduc
tory speech, president Pam Reinagel said the 
purpose of these lectures is to stimulate think
ing by making issues like this available.
The club was started in January with the in
tention of making Objectivist ideas available on 
campus. It currently has about fifteen members. 
Objectivism is a philosophy first proposed by 
authoress Ayn Rand in fictional writings such 
as Atlas Shrugged and The Fountainhead which 
maintains that reason is the gateway to obtain
ing knowledge about the universe.

Has OPEC, the Organization of Petroleum 
Exporting Countries, finally cracked? The re
cent plunge in oil prices seems to suggest that 
this once powerful cartel has begun to 
deteriorate. In the 1970s, OPEC was very suc
cessful in raising the cost of world oil prices, 
which caused an energy cruch felt world-wide, 
causing a world-wide energy crunch while ear
ning enormous profits for its member countries. 
Now that the world has cut back on consump
tion of oil, it seems as though OPEC is making 
an attempt to regain its hold on the market 
through increasing production and lowering 
prices.
Whatever the motivation, this decline in prices 
has far reaching effects. Here in America, the 
lower oil prices have spurred a rally in the stock 
market, pushing the Dow Jones Industrial 
Average (as well as other indicies) to new hights. 
This is due to the economic benefits of cheaper 
oil, namely decreased production and energy
Energies' stock was selling at under $16 per 
share. Now it is over $20 per share.
Although Pickens does not consider his offer 
as a hostile takeover bid. he said that KN 
Energies started looking for a way out of the 
offer immediately after his January 22 
telephone call.
Out of circulation for approximately six 
months, the press is heralding Pickens offer for 
KN Energies as his comeback into the takeover 
market. Right after the Unical deal, I went thir
ty days, and I had people asking me if I was 
retired." Pickens claims that during the in
terlude, he was cleaning his desk off.
Meyers then interceded to start the academic 
portion of Pickens talk. Pickens was asked to 
discuss the Mesa-Gulf-Chevron episodes in 
terms of crisis management. Pickens gave a
costs, which spurn higher productivity and 
profits.
All American corporations arent benefiting 
from the recent fall in prices, however. The 
worst hit are, of course, the oil companies 
themselves, as they are forced to lower their 
prices to remain competitive. The value of the 
reserves these companies own have been 
lowered drastically, putting more downward 
pressure on their stocks and bonds. Many in
vestors were caught by surprise and saw the 
value of their investments plunge with the price 
of oil. A notable example is the CMU Invest
ment group, as it watched its bonds in the Petro 
Lewis Corporation fall from near sixty to a low 
of fourty, a hefty decline indeed.
On the world market, gold has eased higher 
as countries put their trust in gold rather than 
the world banking structure. Some banks are 
being weakened as oil revenue dependent coun
tries, such as Mexico, struggle to pay their 
debts. Other countries are involved as well. 
Russia, the single largest oil producer in the
brief history of the situation, starting with the 
formation of Mesa Limited.
Pickens formed Mesa Limited in order to 
raise capital to invest in Gulf Oil. He felt that 
Gulfs stock was undervalued, and that there 
was a way to make more money for gulf 
shareholders. Pickens, through Mesa Ltd., 
bought 13% of Gulf stock.
Pickens approached Gulf with a proposal for 
a royalty trust, where Gulf would spin-off some 
of its excess capital to the stockholders. Gulf 
became instantly defensive, and tried desperate
ly to fight against Pickens, instead of working 
with him.
Eventually, Gulf offered Pickens green
mail. A proposal to buy out only Mesa Ltd. 
at much more than Mesas holdings were worth. 
Pickens refused, so Gulf turned for help, and
recapture market
world, will have to look for a way of recovering 
the loss in revenue it normally receives through 
oil sales.
Overall, the fall in oil prices should continue 
to be an impetus to the American economy, 
unless the Congress should decide to place a 
tax on imported oil. This would tend to erase 
any effects of lower oil prices. The road ahead 
looks rocky for OPEC and other nations depen
dent on oil, but the possibilities are endless for 
the American economy.

CMU teaches English as a second languagefree
By NATALIE CAPONE
Tartan Stajfwriter
The difficulties with the English language that 
many foreign students have when they come to 
Carnegie Mellon have prompted the Carnegie 
Mellon Teaching Center to develop the English 
as a Second Language (ESL) Center.
The ESL Center, which has been in opera
tion since August, 1985, offers free individual 
tutoring and language classes to non-native 
speakers of English at Carnegie Mellon. Accor
ding to Tom Huckin, Director of ESL, approx
imately ten percent of the Carnegie Mellon stu
dent population is foreign,, a percentage which 
translates to almost 550 students. At least half 
of these students are studying at the graduate 
level.
Although the Administration had perceived 
a need for some sort of ESL program after 
observing the difficulties that foreign students 
have, particularly during their first year in 
America, it is the added dimension of foreign 
Teaching Assistants that was the motivation for 
creating the ESL Center.
Huckin said that there are many foreign 
graduate students who work as T.A.s. Some," 
Huckin said, although good in technical skills, 
have trouble with communication. This was the 
major problem which stimulated the formation 
of the ESL Center. It is not a matter of the 
students not having had previous exposure to 
the English language: Most of the students 
have had formal instruction in English, even as 
much as eight to ten years. But they didn't have 
a chance to speak or hear it spoken, Huckin 
explained.
The heart of the ESL program is the free in
dividual tutoring service that is offered on an 
appointment schedule. All foreign students are 
entitled to free 40-minute tutoring sessions
every7 week. This is an intensive, highly in
dividualized instruction that is on a private oneto-one level. It is very effective, said Huckin. 
The tutoring sessions consist of lots of conver
sation between student and tutor, with the tutor 
correcting language-related problems that 
emerge naturally while speaking.
The second part of the ESL program is sixweek long classes which focus on various areas 
such as speaking and listening, pronunciation, 
writing and grammar, and a T.A. preparation 
course. Presently the T.A. course is taught on
ly to potential T.A.s in the Math department, 
but hopefully the scope of the program will soon 
be able to branch out. Huckin emphasized that 
the classes are not drilling, but instead con
sist of communication activities with a great 
deal of interaction. The small class size of 10 
to 20 students lends itself to this interaction. 
The new six-week session of the classes will
continued from page 3
At 6:30 p.m., one shuttle and one escort 
driver come on duty. The shuttle leaves every 
half hour and runs the entire route, Clyde Street 
stops first. The last shuttle departure is at 11:30 
p.m., but another escort driver comes on duty 
at that time.
If you need a ride from Skibo to your offcampus residence which isnt on the shuttle 
route, escort just might be the way. Your 
destination does have to be within the predeter
mined bounds, however. Escort service is 
limited to a radius of on to one-and-a-half miles 
around campus, and it will not take large groups 
of people to parties. For the sake of time, escort 
does not take riders to movie theaters or bars, 
either. Escort usually has as many requests as 
it can handle for individual campus-to-residence 
escorts alone.
How do you request an escort? Just walk inbegin after mid-semester.
The ESL Center is staffed by five graduate 
students and three undergraduate students, all 
of whom are American. 75 foreign students 
have participated in the program. Although the 
program is available to all foreign students, the 
center has only been used by East Asian and 
European students so far.
It is Huckins hope that the foreign student 
population of Carnegie Mellon will become 
aware of the existence of the ESL Center and 
take advantage of its free services.
The ESL Tutoring Center is located in the 
Bureau of Mines, Room A19, Monday through 
Thursday: 9am to 6pm, and Friday: 9am to 
5pm; and in Baker Hall 228A Sunday through 
Thursday: 7pm to 9pm. For more information 
about the available classes, or to schedule a 
tutoring appointment, call 268-4979.
to Skibos lower level entrance and talk to the 
dispatcher. He or she is the one sitting at the 
desk next to the art store. After the shuttles last 
departure at 11:30 p.m., escort will pick peo
ple up at off-campus university housing areas 
and bring them back to Skibo. To request such 
a pick-up, dial 268-2333. An estimated waiting 
time will be given, usually not more than fif
teen minutes after the call was place.
The last escort pick-up call is accepted at ap
proximately 2:15 a.m., and the last escort bus 
leaves at 3:25 a.m.
For more information, including times for offcampus stops, contact the campus security of
fice or stop by the escort dispatch desk after 
6:30 p.m. (The most recent printed schedule 
is now out of date. The shuttle now runs on the 
same schedule seven days a week. After 6:00 
p.m., the schedule is the same as the most re
cent weekend schedule.)
Nude Olympics 
Dangerous at 50 below
The president of Purdue University, who was 
one of thousands of spectators at last years an
nual Nude Olympics, has turned on the cold 
water for this years event.
Besides violating nudity laws, the endurance 
race, in which students take a midnight romp 
in the buff through campus, could result in 
lasting injuries, says President Steven Beering, 
who is also a physician.
When youve go 300 people running around 
start naked at minus 50 degrees (the wind chill 
during the last race), you run the major risk of 
frostbite and losing tips of noses, fingers, 
genitalia, breasts, toes and so on.
A committee Beering appointed to study the 
matter says the event had gone beyond being 
just an innocent bit of fun and frolic, and wor
ried that allowing students to expose themselves 
in sub-zero weather could expose the universi
ty to personal injury lawsuits.
While insisting that safety was his overriding 
concern in his decision, Beering said he also 
was mindful of public relations.
The Nude Olympics, he says, suggests an im

Biden: The World is complicated as hell.
continued from page 1
improvements in U.S. foreign policy, because 
we have come to a point in the 1980s were 
there are a number of important issues that must 
be considered. These issues are the conse
quence of changing times and a changing world. 
Biden sees the reasons for this changing world 
as being the creation of 105 brand new nations 
beginning in 1968, the disarray of World 
monetary' systems that began in the 1970s and 
the change in appeal of Marxist doctrines, which 
influenced the relative strengths of the leading 
world powers.
Sen. Biden sees the changes as a conse
quence of the inevitable movement and tides 
of U.S. and World history. Using tag-team 
wrestling as a metaphor for the U.S.s position 
in the world after WWII, Biden contends that 
although Great Britain, France and the USSR 
won in the war, we were left standing as the 
preeminent power in the world. Our foreign 
policy after the war was one influenced by the 
fact that we did have all the power, that we were 
the only guy on the block.
However, Biden asserts that changes in the 
power of other nations was inevitable. It was in
evitable that our enemies would become our 
trading partners and that our allies (namely the 
USSR) would gain power and become our 
enemies. These changes lead to a fundamen
tally different world in 1986, one in which 
Biden feels the U.S. cannot solely rely on 
military might and in which we should address 
the issue of relative power among nations. 
He sees no time in the future were one nation 
(i.e. the U.S.) will be the predominant power 
in the world. There will never be another war 
in which one nation can come out as the clear 
victor. Biden believes our present conduct of 
foreign policy is a naive quest for the time 
when U.S. military might could alter the course 
of the world. Biden wonders if it is a laudable 
goal for the U.S. to seek and maintain an over
whelming military superiority.
On the opposite side of the American political 
spectrum (the Democrats), Biden feels a totally 
different policy has arisen, one in which military 
power is not considered effective. Biden sees 
the U.S. public as believing the Democrats feel 
the U.S. is a crippled giant and should not con
sidered projection of force anywhere in the 
world. The Democrats on the Left use im
aginative diplomacy in conducting their foreign 
policy. Imaginative diplomacy is founded on the 
belief that in every Third world nation, there 
is a democratic middle ground. Biden believes 
that the conflicting Democratic imaginative 
diplomacy and the Republican militaristic 
Cold War warrior " views are both extremely 
naive and have proven ineffective.
The solution to this conflict, Biden feels, is 
the realization that power and diplomacy are in
separable. He contends that Power without 
purpose leads to little more than posture and 
that Diplomacy without power exhausts itself 
on rhetoric. This combination must take place, 
Biden believes, for we are not only on the verge 
of loosing our control in limiting nuclear arms, 
but are also living in a significant time in the 
conduct of human affairs. The conflicts in the 
Middle East, Central America, Black Africa and 
the movement of China into the modern world 
must be met with effective foreign policy.
Sen. Biden offered an outline for this foreign 
policy, which consisted of erecting signposts and 
following four basic principles. The two 
signposts are that we should not return to the 
policies of the Cold War era and that we should 
shed the stigma we have towards our Vietnam 
policy. Biden sees power as making a signifi
cant difference in our position in the world, not 
as a source of weakness that many Democrats 
felt it was.
The first of Bidens four principles in conduc
ting U.S. foreign policy is one that makes the 
Cold War Warriors mildly happy, and says
military power is important. Developing a pari
ty (but not superiority) with the USSR is an 
essential component of an effective and balanc
ed policy.
Bidens second principle is that the U.S. 
government must better define and articulate 
what its actual foreign policy is to the American 
people. As seen from the Vietnam War, foreign 
policy cannot be sustained without the support 
of the American people. Biden sees this as be
ing one of the drawbacks with democracy. The
U.S. must still decide what constitutes our in
terests, before any interests can actually be ar
ticulated to the U.S. public.
The third principle is the development of 
regimes of cooperation in areas like the environ
ment, nuclear arms and conventional forces with 
the USSR. Although Biden feels the USSR are 
the bad guys and that all the bad things said 
about the USSR are true, he also believes we 
cannot afford to treat the Soviet as if it did not 
exist. The problem with present policy making 
towards the Soviets is that it is influenced by 
an implicit feeling that they always outsmart 
us. Because of this, we avoid engaging in 
dialogue with the Soviets. Biden, again using 
history in analyzing policy directions, feels not 
much has changed in Russian foreign policy 
from the Czar to the Commissar. He sees the 
Soviets as being conservative, cautious and 
predictable.
This predictability could be used by the U.S. 
to find a way to achieve benefits by granting 
the Soviets benefits. It is obviously in the in
terests of both the USSR and the U.S. to pre
vent the proliferation of nuclear war-making 
capabilities. Both sides fear that a Third World 
nation will obtain nuclear power and use it to 
start a full-scale nuclear conflict. In fact the risk 
of a small power initiating a war is much greater 
than the USSR or the U.S. beginning one. With 
regimes of Cooperation, Biden feels both powers 
could deal with this problem and others more 
effectively.
The fourth and final principle in Bidens 
outline of an effective U.S. foreign policy is that 
we should develop a much more sophisticated 
view of the Third World. He feels we cannot 
continue to view the Third World in absolute 
terms, such as the good vs. the bad guys, or 
totalitarian vs. authoritarian powers. Biden 
points to both the Carter and Reagan ad
ministrations as examples where Third World 
policy was governed by a single factor. With 
Carter it was the human rights issue and with 
Reagan it is whether or not the governments are 
Marxist or Capitalist. Biden believes these fac
tors should be considered, but also feels other 
issues are involved and that none should have 
absolute control.
Sen. Biden argued that we should not expect 
the Third World countries that have just been 
created to have a clear idea of their directions. 
It took the Western world centuries to arrive 
at the place we are at now. Turmoil and con
flict will be an inevitable part of the develop
ment of these countries, and Biden feels the 
position of the U.S. should be one of nonalignment, because as he stated, the World 
is complicated as hell. We should considered 
not only human rights, but should also be con
cerned with the relationship of the Third World 
with other World powers. In this way, our Third

Murder and corruption mar Phillippine election
By GAVIN WILLIAMS
Tartan Stqffwriter
The fraud and corruption that was expected 
in the Philippine Presidential elections held last 
Friday, Feb. 7th, between President Ferdinand 
Marcos and Mrs. Corazon Aquino, appeared 
early. Charges came from the National Move
ment for Free Elections (NAMFREL), an in
dependent Filipino poll-watching group, that ar
my troops and Marcos workers went door to 
door in Manila, on the night of Thursday the 
6th. forcing or bribing voters to fill out ballot 
slips.
With the opening of the {lolls at 7 AM, signs 
of corruption and intimidation were immediately 
seen. The Philippine electorate of 26 million 
is situated in voting precincts that spread over
7.000 islands, making the widespread corrup
tion hard to control.
A 20-member, U.S. commission headed by 
Sen. Richard Lugar (R-Ind.) was present dur
ing the elections and attempted to monitor 
voting procedures. Members of the commission 
were allowed to enter the polling places, 
escorted by a commission official, after a rul
ing forbidding observors from getting closer 
than 50 feet to the polling place was modified 
for them.
The observors reported harrassment of NAM
FREL pollwatchers by the military , who had 
been deployed by Marcos to keep order. 
Priests and nuns sat on ballot boxes, defending 
them with their bodies from Marcos workers 
who tried to steal them, often at gun-point. Ballot 
stuffing and bribery of voters was widespread. 
Such tactics have been commonplace in past 
Philippine elections and motivated a pollwatcher to state, What we like to say is that 
if the voting is only fairly dirtv, the result will 
be honest.
As the ballot counting began, both Marcos 
and Aquino predicted victory7. These predictions
were based on slow and conflicting returns the 
night of the 7th. Sen. Lugar stated, Given this 
counting business, its awfully difficult to make 
heads or tails. Members of the commission 
were disturbed by the pattern of voting and were 
certain of abuses. In conjunction with an official 
count of the votes, NAMFREL began an in
dependent tally which showed Mrs. Aquino 
leading the night of the 7th, with only a small 
number of the votes in. The Marcos government 
threatened to halt the NAMFREL count.
By the end of election day, the rampant 
violence had taken its toll. Scores of NAMFRELs 500,000 workers were forced to leave 
their posts because of harassment from arm
ed thugs. At least 46 people were killed on 
election day itself. Fifteen Aquino supporters 
riding to vote in Manila were killed when a 
grenade was thrown into their truck. Most of 
the dead were Aquino supporters or opposition 
leaders, although one Marcos official was shot 
while going to monitor the polls.
On Saturday, the 8th, Aquino held a lead over 
Marcos in all the different tallies of the votes. 
The official tally, made by the nine-member 
Commission on Elections, appointed by Mar
cos, reported Aquino had an edge of 2,932 
votes, after 3% of the vote was counted. NAMFRELs unofficial tally, which is endorsed by 
U.S. officials and the Roman Catholic Church, 
put Aquino ahead by 2,276,466 votes to Mar
cos's 1,638,439. The vote-counting continued 
slowly and drew protests of election 
irregularities.
The first indications that Marcos might sus
pend the election also came on Saturday, when 
he announced the possibility of declaring the 
election invalid, and that he may reschedule it. 
Aquino and her supporters also expressed their 
concern that if they did win the election, fierce 
retribution would be met out by Marcos in the 
form of assassinations. The vote tally in the
Commission on Elections began moving in Mar
coss favor, while NAMFRELs count showed 
a continuing lead for Aquino.
Sen. Richard Lugar, on Sunday, the 9th, 
charged Marcos with manipulating results and 
that this would affect U.S.-Philippine relations. 
Lugar said, My feeling is that the count is be
ing managed, manipulated. Despite the fact 
that the outcome is still unclear, by Sunday, 
Filipinos from both parties believed Marcos was 
planning to stay in power, no matter what hap
pened. Marcos seemed to affirm this in an in
terview on Sunday when he stated, pulling out 
has never been one of the ideas I have con
sidered.
It was obvious by Sunday that the Reagan ad
ministration faced a difficult policy decision 
toward the Philippines if Marcos fraudulently 
stayed in power. An official decision of the situa
tion was postponed until Sen. Lugars commis
sion returned and reported on the election. The 
White House prohibited public discussion of the 
election by Administration officials until a deci
sion could be made using the Commisions 
findings.
On Monday, the 10th, Marcos moved the 
count of the votes to the National Assembly (the 
ruling body of the Philippines, dominated by
Marcos backers), from the Commission on Elec
tions. The already slow moving counting of the 
ballots was further bogged down in the 
Assembly, because of various legal complica
tions in the system. The count has been going 
on for the past week, with continued debating 
over procedures for the official counting of the 
ballots slowing down the process.
Because of conflicts in the counting of ballots, 
both candidates claimed they had officially won 
by Tuesday, the 11th. The possibility that Mar
cos and Aquino would swear themselves in 
separately to head two competing regimes also 
arose. At the same time, Aquinos party pro
tested the electoral fraud and violence that was 
continuing in the election. Mrs. Aquino label
ed the election as one of the most shameful 
electoral frauds ever perpetrated against a peo
ple in the name of democracy. Marcos called 
her protests, Childish.
At the beginning of the week, President 
Reagan did not hold a firm judgment on the 
reports of fraud by Aquino supporters. Reagan 
called on both sides to work together to form 
a viable government and spoke about 
evidence of a strong two-party system now in 
the islands. Although Reagan said he would 
continued on page 7
Biden warns against Rambo tendency
continued from page 5
World policy will be more sophisticated and will 
accomplish more than the policies of the past
10 years.
Sen. Biden turned next to a short discussion 
of terrorism and how it worked into the U.S.s 
foreign policy. He also saw terrorism as a very 
complex situation, and feels the U.S. must 
outline what constitutes terrorisms. We must 
also stop talking about terrorism in a flawed con
text, with the USSR being the route of all ter
rorism. Biden feels we must realize that ter
rorism has a life of its own and that we should 
give up the Rambo tendency of hastily pro
nouncing retaliation no matter what the conse
quences are.#.4*. ^
In closing, Sen. Biden reiterated his belief that 
the conduct of foreign policy is not simplistic 
and stressed his belief that decisions made now 
will lock us on a single path for the next 10 or 
15 years.

comment on the Administrations position after 
consulting with Sen. Lugar, spokesmen for the 
White House made statements which indicated 
Marcos had won the election. These and later 
statements angered Aquino and her supporters, 
for they seemed to indicate U.S. support of 
Marcos.
Violence continued throughout the Philip
pines during the week after the elections. Kill
ings have been carried out to suppress political 
opposition. The most serious of these killings 
came on Tuesday, the 11th, when Evelio Javier, 
a leading member of the opposition, was gunn
ed down by masked gunmen in San Jose de 
Buenavista. Javier was an outspoken critic of 
Marcoss government and was a leader of 
Aquinos campaign in San Jose de Buenavista.
On the same day as Javiers killing, President 
Reagan announced he was sending a special en
voy, Philip C. Habib to the Philippines. Habibs 
purpose was to assess the desires and needs 
of the Filipino people and so help the Ad
ministration develop a clearer stance on the 
Philippine election.
On Wednesday, the 12th, the Reagan ad
ministration moved to end the confusion among 
Filipino citizens and Aquinos party created by 
Reagans statements about the election. Aquino 
was alarmed by Reagans belief that both 
sides were involved in the election fraud and 
violence. She saw Reagan as backing Marcos. 
President Reagan instructed the U.S. Am
bassador in Manila to give Mrs. Aquino
ByGAVI
assurance that Reagan did not completely belief 
Marcos had won the election and that a final 
decision still had to be made. Members of the 
Senate were also critical of Reagans statements 
and obvious stance in regard to who had won 
the election.
President Reagan most recently recanted his 
controversial comments by announcing Satur
day that he felt Marcos was solely to blame for 
the corruption in the election. On the same day, 
the Philippine National Assembly announced 
that Marcos has won the election with about 
53% of the vote. Mrs. Aquino felt this 
fraudulent victory would hurt Marcos, for he will 
lose the support of virtually every Philippine and 
the United States.

Editorial&
Carnegie salutes Carnegie 
versus campus events
Staging a show like Carnegie salutes Carnegie featur
ing stars like Andy Williams, Jerry Lewis, Barbara 
Feldon, Charles Hade and others is a classy way to kick 
off a capital campaign. It is soft sell, but attractive to 
alumni and the media. The question is, however, is it 
attractive to students. The answer seems to be no.
So theres going to be a show in the Civic Arena and 
there are going to be lots of big names there. OK. But 
what are we really going to see? With the exception of 
Jerry Lewis and Andy Williams, all of the performers 
will be Carnegie Mellon students or alumni who will 
entertain us with their diverse artistic abilities. This is 
simply an opportunity for us to enjoy the talents of 
Carnegie Mellon students and graduates, and appreciate 
the schools contributions to the world of entertainment 
in particular, and to the world in general.
The setting for this gala event will be the Civic Arena. 
A section of seats will be removed and a stage will be 
inserted into one side of the Arena and tables for ten 
will be set-up on the floor. This seating will be sold to 
individuals and corporations for the show. During the 
show itself, there will be no soliciting of contributions 
to the capital campaign. Now consider the decision to 
schedule this celebrity celebration on April 19.
Why on earth did they schedule an event in the Civic 
Arena on the last night of Spring Carnival? For the same 
reasons that we students wish they hadnt. Carnival is 
the one time when all the members of the university 
community, past and present, are on campus, relaxed 
and looking for a party. Robert Finkel, the producer 
of Carnegie salutes Carnegie (class of 40), and Public 
Relations feel, that in putting together this show, they 
are giving the party that everyone is looking for. 
However, many students are not looking off campus for 
their party. They want to be on campus, on the Mid
way, at a Greek party, whatever. This is an obvious dif
ference in perspective.
Coordination could make up for these differing points 
of view by eliminating the competition between cam
pus events and the Civic Arena event. If students have 
to choose between staying on campus for the traditional 
festivities and trekking down to the Civic Arena to see 
Andy Williams sing Amazing Grace, most of us will 
probably stay on campus. The best way around this 
dilemma is not to have any Carnival events scheduled 
on campus between 8:30 Saturday night, when the 
event will begin, until 11:00 by which time people can 
be back on campus. Unfortunately, the Midway would 
have to close and the award ceremony would have to 
wait until after the show. Transportation to and from 
the Civic Arena would have to be available or the in
convenience of getting to the show will be enough to 
turn students off.
A final suggestion deals with the potential generation 
gap between alumni and students. The campus groups 
who will be performing, like the Jazz Choir may ap
peal to students; Andy Williams and Jerry Lewis may 
not. For students to enjoy the program, it will have to 
include the type of entertainment which college students 
like. The planners should solicit feedback from the stu
dent body concerning what they would most enjoy see
ing in a campus entertainment event, and make an at
tempt to incorporate these suggestions.

Outrage stems from comics
Editor:
Let me add my voice to the chorus 
of readers offended by Nabil 
Liumangs comics. (I would also like 
to thank the brave gay student who 
wrote to express anger at one of the 
comics stereotyped images.) Mr. 
Liumang has so far exhibited sexism, 
homophobia (hatred and fear of les
bians and gay men), and an in
credibly boring lack of humor. With 
last weeks magazine-cover cartoon, 
Eighty, he shows ageism as well.
Mockery and hatred of older 
women is a form of sexism; in this 
culture, women are devalued as they 
grow beyond the Seventeen 
magazine image of beauty and reach 
their full maturity. Older men are 
seen as distinguished" and hand
some. which is more than partly 
related to the fact that they usually 
retain or increase their economic 
power as they mature. Women have 
traditionally had little access to 
economic and social power unless 
linked by birth or marriage to finan
cially secure men. Things haven't 
changed that much; women still 
make 59 C to a mans dollar, and a 
majority of the poor people in this 
country- are older women.
Aging women have wrinkles and 
grey hair, signs of wisdom and ex
perience which are despised since 
men prefer women to be as 
"feminine, i.e. childlike, as possi
ble: innocent, giggly defenseless and 
inexperienced (virginal). The 
counterpart of this stereotype is the 
whore image of the woman who 
knows about sex; this stereotype is 
also used to measure and degrade 
womens sexuality.
Mens's need to have women be 
younger and weaker (and shorter!) 
has been expressed in soft-core porn 
by Playboy models wearing ankle 
socks and pigtails, and by the 
Hustler cartoon Chester the 
Molester. which implies that girls 
ask for it" and that raping girls is
funny. Hard-core child porn carries 
this preference for younger women 
to its most extreme form.
Linking Mr. Liumangs comic to 
child porn may seem extreme, but 
as long as older women are mock
ed, de-sexualized and trivialized, the 
youth culture will remain more than 
a harmless joke or a series of images 
on a Pepsi commercial. Mocking 
older women is a violence; denying 
them their sexuality and sexual
desire (which, in women, has been 
proven to increase with age and ex
perience) is as violent as forcing sex
uality on children and women. As a 
woman who will someday show 
physical signs of aging, I refuse to 
be judged by Mr. Liumangs sexist 
and ageist standards, and I will not 
be silent while he tries to belittle the 
older beauty I will become.

Reverse discrimination
Editor:
How would you react if Ronald 
Reagan demanded that everyone 
who was white should vote for him? 
What would you do to a man who 
wrote to the newspapers demanding 
more respect for men? If you are 
anything like me regarding racism or 
sexism you would probably become 
very angry. Such racism, however, 
does exist, and is often lauded.
Though Reagan was prudent 
enough to keep from saying 
anything so riduculous, a less 
scrupulous running mate had no 
such qualms, the Rev. Jesse 
Jackson.
Though no man is foolish enough 
to write a letter as sexist as the let
ter mentioned above, a CMU student 
submitted a similar letter to The 
Tartan.
The audacity of that letter was to 
complain of a comic that suggested 
women at CMU are not all attractive. 
Nobody complained when a few 
weeks earlier the same thing was sug
gested about men at CMU. I am sure 
that the same letter with the word 
women replaced by men and 
vice versa would probably have been 
thrown in the garbage by the 
editorial staff.
Celebrating White Week is 
publicly immoral, yet Black Week 
makes the front page. I am not sug
gesting that all ethnic activities
should be suspended, but sometimes 
reverse discrimination becomes a 
driving force behind the behavior of 
many people.
Racism and sexism still abound in 
this country, and not in any par
ticular ethnic group. Before a com
ment is made, people should look at 
it from anmothers point of view. If 
everyone could do this successfully 
racism and sexism would be stopped 
in their tracks.

Quality of life: the university center
by Karen Lee
Believe it or not. the university center is a 
reality! There are already committees formed 
to make the university center. The following ar
ticle will detail all that I presently know about 
^cerner. Other important issues concerning 
the university's progress will be 
discussed in following articles. You 
can find out more by stopping at 
ggj my office hours this week.
In the Board of Trustees meeting last monday. President Cyert made a firm commitment 
to the center, He realizes that it definitely needs 
to be built. The rest of the administration and 
many board members are also committed to 
making the center the number one priority
The project has three parts. Firstly. Skibo is 
to be renovated and 26.000 square feet will be 
added. Although exactly what will be in the new 
'Skibo  has not been decided on, tentative 
ideas include meeting spaces, the bookstore, the 
post office, and new offices for student organizations. The estimated cost of this alone will be 
S8.2 million.
Secondly, a new 100.000 fitness-recreation 
center will be added to Skibo. Ideas for the 
center include: multipurpose gym area; jogging 
track; 50 meter pool: racquetball. squash, and 
tennis courts; fitness-weight training room; 
lockers, showers, equipment rooms: offices for 
the Athletic Department: and meeting areas. 
The estimated cost is SI2.8 million. The gym 
we have today will still be used as a gvm for 
basketball, volleyball, etc.
W hile not as strongly committed to a Perfor
ming Arts Center and Theatre compared to the 
two above, the committees are making a strong 
effort to raise gifts for this. There will be two 
auditorium style theaters. Remember though, 
this will be added sometime, mavbe at the same 
time as the whole center.
Two committees have been set up to decide 
on the details related to the center. The com
mittees are the campaign and the planning comLetters continued:

and defining the only manner in which they may' 
be treated? If so, theirs is a political cause, one, 
which will have little success if all of the party 
members wish to remain anonymous?
I do understand the author's motive, that of 
wishing to be an accepted member of the com
munity. Yet if he/she requests apologies and 
retractions from each person that offends his/her 
sensibilities he/she will spend much time pur
suing token gestures when the real issue he/she 
must deal withthat of fostering human 
tolerancewill be easily glossed over. It is much 
simpler to remain hidden in ones corner and 
lash out at the general populace for hurting 
ones feelings. It is another thing to live ones 
life as one sees fitwhether or not the general 
public agrees with itunashamedly, yet without 
intolerance for the intolerant, (for what could 
be more self-defeating than that?)
Personally, I am in sympathy with the 
anonymous gay students plight. I simply wish 
that he/she and others like him/her would come 
out of the closet.

Comic responds
Dear Sisters and BrothersHello, my name is Liumang. Nabil Liumang.
I am the creator of Zurk. I am writing in 
response to the dissent which has been caused by 
my last two art pieces. I feel a bit of explana
tion is in rder to help those troubled by my 
humor understand why I do what I do.
I am a satirist. Its that simple. I do not try 
to humiliate anyone, only use in my art what 
I see in my world. If that ends up antagonizing 
a persons beliefs, I really cant help it. There 
are many different viewpoints and I cannot 
please everyone everytime.
I am not a CMU womanizer, nor do I detest 
homosexuals. If there was a joke on the CMU 
campus about little puppy drool on newly wax
ed kitchen floors, I would probably have a 
satirical commentary on little puppy drool on 
newly waxed kitchen floors. I don t intend to 
offend little puppies, only relate to others 
through my art what I see and hear at CMU.
I hope this offers a bit of explanation to all
vou viewers. .. ... . .Nabil Liumang
Narrow Minds
Editor:
I strongly suggest the title of your column be 
changed from the Inquiring Minds to Narrow 
Minds. I realize that the writers are freshmen 
and havent been out in the real world or seen 
very much of it. Since they are the future 
citizens of this great land and being of the older 
generation, may I make a few suggestions.

Ted \ierenberg. a Trustee who is very 
dedicated to this project. It is comprised of 
Trustees. Friends, administration, faculty, and 
3 students. The students are Maria Cousineau. 
Doug Camplejohn. and Mark Hart. The com
mittee will fundraise, review and recommend 
the program for the Center and oversee the 
selection of the architect.
discriminate they should please do some 
research and comparisons. Where can students 
eat all the fresh fruit that they can consume or 
line their trays with 5-6 glasses of juice, go back 
for seconds and thirds? Believe me it is being 
done! (Check with Kiltie costs!)
Many of the UDS employees have children, 
grandchildren and friends attending other 
universities and colleges. Ask them about their 
food service. They don't have a Comment Table 
where they can dictate what they want and make 
changes or have exciting specials i.e. Coney 
Island Day, Mexican Fiesta or a Candlelite Din
ner to name a few. These also send food costs 
soaring.
I eat at the Kiltie five days a week (two meals 
a day) and I am totally pleased with the food, 
the environment, the new salad bar, and new 
chairs. I am happy to say I will sleep nights in

know it is held by the very, very minority. The

UDS insulted
Editor:
This letter is in response to the letter the Inquring Staff, Stew Levine and Randy Wilson 
had printed in the Tartan newspaper February
11, 1986.
On behalf of my fellow employees, I find this 
letter an insult to the way we take pride in our 
work with U.D.S. I have been an employee of 
Carnegie Mellon University Food Service for the 
past 21 years. During this time I have been a 
cook, line person and cashier. I enjoy my job 
because I come in contact with some very nice 
students who really appreciate us. How do I 
know? Many of them have told me so.
To say the things you have said is very de
grading to us. My co-workers take pride in their 
work and are very excellent employees. They 
do a superb job. To give negative views on all 
of our eating areas is outrageous! What other 
college has as many eating facilities as we do?
U.D.S. has a Comment Table several times 
each in our dining room (Kiltie Cafe) if you 
wanted to make your complaints or comments, 
not in the Tartan newspaper.
U.D.S. management and employees put on 
beautiful events such as Valentines Day, Hallo
ween, and a Winter picnic to say the least. I 
as a cashier have been told how nice these 
events are by our student customers. These af
fairs take a lot of time and effort. The food serv
ed in our facilities is top quality, prepared by 
very professional people in their field. (This is 
the view held by my fellow workers).
We think we deserve an apology. Thank you 
for letting me get this off of my mind.

like sub-zero weather stop them.
We feel that there is a simpler answer. Our 
protestors have simply run out of thing to pro
test. Realistically, how long can you make an 
issue out of abortion, South Africa, SEI, or SDI 
anyway? To return the Cut to normal, we 
need to find new issues for these people to pro
test. Naturally, we have a few suggestions.
Why is it SUPA always has the best parties? 
Whenever you walk through Margaret Morrison, 
no matter what time of the day, there is always 
a party in the SUPA lounge! How come only 
SUPA seems to know how to throw a decent 
mixer? Shouldn't they be forced to tpach other 
colleges how to get down and party?
Its currendy too easy to steal trays from Tar
tan Grill. Half the fun of traying is getting the 
trays in the first place. How can any sutdent 
get any pleasure out of just walking up, taking 
a tray, and leaving. The thrill, the exhiliration, 
and the risk of petty larceny just arent there. 
Certainly UDS could move the trays to a more 
challenging location.
There is also the question of INvestment. Why 
arent our funds in North Dakota? Weve never 
been there, but we hear its a nice state.
Of course, one could always protest Iron Ci
ty Beer (just on general principle).
In closing, we'd like to welcome David Lews 
Quesiton and Answers column to the world of 
serious journalism. In fact, we'd like to start him 
off with a question. Dave, what were the results 
of the 1957 Afghanistan yak census? Do we ac
tually give a damn? What do you think?

Dating
continued from page 9
This guy had a black book that was so long he 
had two volumes the E-Z one and of course, 
the non E-Z ones. Sonny had a golden rule. In 
dating, Sonny said, remember, it is better to 
look cool than to be cool. His other advice? 
"You got to use lines, man, you simply got to 
use'm. They work for me.
Ah, now, about these all-American lines. In 
the true sense of the term they are, dynamite. 
Time them right, use them right and they 
deliver. One slip though, they could blow up 
in your face. I should know. I was at this party 
when I saw this rather heavy set girl (fashionably 
called, refrigerette) standing alone in a corner. 
As the evening progressed I noticed that no guy 
approached her; needless to say, no girl ap
proached me either. At last I decided to make 
concussion and three broken ribs. And Sonny 
said dating is just a harmless pastime.
I then turned elsewhere for help, this time 
though it was professional Yes, you guessed 
it, the TV. Ever seen that commercial in which 
the guy pops a breath freshener in his mouth, 
and before you know it, he is walking away with 
this beautiful stranger? Now you ask any home
grown sensible American kid who has logged 
his hours in this game and he will tell you it 
is just fantasy, does not work that way in real 
life. Now, as you may have realized, I am not 
a home-grown sensible American kid neither 
have I logged enough hours in this game. I 
decided to give this rather novel technique a 
try. I packed my backpack with more of those 
mints than David Letterman had in his AlkaSeltzer suit and set off on a hiking trail.
Then it happened. The Encounter. As I was 
helping that tired and breath-freshened beauty 
hikress to her feet, she said: Well, I sure would 
like to get to know you better. It worked. Why 
dont you take a hike... I started. Get lost 
she snapped back, walking away. . . . with me 
to the end of this trail so we can talk? I shouted 
after her as she disappeared into the foliage.
I still haven't figured out what went wrong.
I was never quite successful at figuring out
girls even back home, let alone understanding 
girls here. So I decided to pursue the try-oneif-it-fails-try-another approach. I would be the 
first to admit that it doesn't always work. At a 
party, I saw this pretty young thing dressed to 
kill. Maybe she liked the macho type. I really 
dig you, babe'' I offered in the machoest of 
voices. She looked at me. You dig any deeper 
and I'll bury you in that hole. Not the macho 
type. Maybe she was the sensitive type. Look, 
I haven't had a date for two months; my friends 
laugh at me. Please say yes to going out with 
me just once; it will get the monkey off my 
back. She looked at me closely. Thats fun
ny she said I thought it was only natural for 
monkeys to carry monkeys on their back. 
Evidently not the sensitive type either.
As the party wound down and we were about 
to leave, I noticed her car was stuck. She ap
proached me and said Maybe I will let you 
take me home. Go to Hell I replied, without 
pausing to think and started pulling away in my 
car. A moment later I realized I had been im
polite, maybe downright rude. I backed up my 
car, rolled down the window and as she took 
a step towards my car, I said: By the way, have 
a nice trip and drove away. Who says America 
is no longer a land of opportunity?

Three Russian Ballets Preformed by the PBT
By LISA McANANY
Tartan Editor in Chief
Daring seems to be the best adjective to 
describe the Pittsburgh Ballet Theatres presen
tation of Petrouchka, Don Juan, and Raymonda Variations. All three ballets featured distinct
ly Russian choreography, characterized by 
demanding musical scores and technical dif
ficulty of movement.
Petrouchka featured PBT principal Charles 
Hagan in the title role which was originally per
formed and immortalized by Vaslav Nijinsky of 
the Ballet Russes. The 30-minute ballet is danc
ed to a score by Igor Stravinsky which the com
poser wrote specifically for this ballet. The ballet
The tragi-comic ballet tells the story of one 
of three carnival puppets. Petrouchka or Little 
Petter is a marionette with a human heart, who 
rivals another puppet, the Moor for the love of 
the third puppet, a ballerina. The characters in 
the ballet have no regard for Petrouchkas emo
tions, and the tragedy of character is made com
plete when the Moor finally kills him. The vivid 
characterization in Petrouchka represents a 
freedom from the stylization of earlier dancing.
Hagan was very effective in communicating 
the emotions of his character using exaggerated 
movements and facial expressions. Hagan 
points to the importance in dancing Petrouchka 
of being a puppet who wants to be human,
agility and exuberance made his execution of 
many aerial movements exciting, despite a few 
noticeable mistakes. Dana Lewis was excellent 
as Donna Anna, as was Laura Desiree, danc
ing Miranda. The ballet was danced to Mozarts 
Piano Concerto No. 21, possibly the composers 
most famous work for the keyboard, known for 
its light and airy cadenzas. However, the piece 
was too narrow in its musical direction to work 
well with the passionate nature of the ballet.
This interpretation of the classic story 
depicted Don Juan being constandy pursued by 
women, when all he really wants is to find a 
good chess match. The striking set, designed 
by Irene Pasinski, accentuated these themes,
performance as the solo ballerina. Her partner, 
Kenneth Nickel, a last-minute substitute for 
Pablo Savoye, was erratic, as his aerial 
movements were well-executed, but his timing 
was inconsistent. The scenes featuring 
ensembles of twelve dancers were the technicalthe best and were also the most enjoyable 
parts of this ballet.
The costumes for this 32-minute ballet 
designed by Karinska, were classical in their 
muted shades of pink and blue. The set and 
lighting were equally unobstrusive, providing a 
soft blue back ground for Balanchines 
neo-classicism.
The collection of these three ballets providwas created for the Ballet Russes, the revolu
tionary company founded by Russian impressario Sergei Diaghilev. Petrouchka was first 
performed in Paris in 1911. It set a new stan
dard for ballet, by encorporating music, costum
ing, and set design to create an entire dramatic 
work of art, rather than just a musical dance. 
Despite the revolutionary nature of this piece, 
however, 44 The ballet was considered to be 
great even in its own time,4 according to Dean 
Akram Midani of CMUs College of Fine Arts, 
who gave a lecture in Heinz Hall on Diaghilev 
and the Ballet Russes on Thursday evening 
prior to the opening performance.
rather than a human who tries to be a puppet. 
PBTs version of the ballet was choreograph
ed by Nicholas Beriozoff after Michael Fokine, 
who originally choreographed the piece for the 
Ballet Russes. The costumes were recreated by 
Budd Hill from the original design by Alexander 
Benois. George Bardygrine was responsible for 
the lighting design.
The weekends performance also featured the 
world premeiere of Don Juan as choreograph
ed by Russian-trained German Zamuel. The 
ballet used challenging and often dangerous 
gymnastic-type movements. The title role was 
danced by PBT principal Pablo Savoye, whose
with a large checker-board heart suspended 
from the back of the stage, which is split at the 
opening of the ballet, but is moved to form a 
complete heart by the end of the work. The 
costumes, designed by Kathleen Zimbicki are 
equally engaging, using metallics and handpainted fabrics to enrich the distinctly Spanish 
styles.
Raymonda Variations, choreographed by 
George Balanchine and danced to the music of 
Alexandre Glazounov, presented a series of 
short interludes of typically Balanchine 
choreography, danced by soloists as well as 
corps de ballet. Dana Lewis gave an energetic
 ed an interesting and at times exciting evening 
of entertainment, though obvious technical er
rors from some of the soloists, detracted from 
the performance. Nonetheless, the overall emo
tional impression left by the performance was 
one of an adequate handling of three pieces 
which are marked by cumbersome technicality

Tartan Theatre/Film Critic
The Women, a play by Clare Boothe Luce 
opened on Wednesday, February 12 at CMUs 
own Kresge Theatre. Set in New York in the 
1930s, The Women takes some very funny 
shots at the rich and idle (and supposedlysophisticated) social elite.
The Women is centered around the life of 
Mary , a member of New Yorks social circle 
who seems to stand above the pettiness of her 
contemporaries. The play follows Mary through 
her discovery that her husband is having an af
fair with another woman, her break up, the years 
following her divorce. Surrounding Mary is a 
veritable gaggle of geese she reluctantly calls 
her friends. They are the real ladies of the social 
elite. Lnfortunately for Mary, they are also une
quivocal bitches who never miss the opportunity 
to gossip about their friend s misfortune or 
speculate about her inevitable divorce. It is 
these friends who eventually cause Marys 
divorce by leaking the information of her hus
bands infidelity to the society section of the 
newspaper. With friends like these, who needs 
enemies? What follows is Mary's struggle with 
the divorce and with the painful reality of be
ing separated from her husband, a man she tru
ly loves. She also has to deal with her friends."
The dialogue that passes between these 
women is absolutely hilarious. Each character 
lends a different kind of humor to the story and 
makes the entire play enjoyable to watch. Nan
cy is a smart talking, unmarried woman writer. 
She joyfully pokes fun at all her friends without 
discrimination. She also has some wonderfully 
cynically lines like Nobody ever misses a 
clever woman. Edith, perenially pregnant, 
has the outlook on life that can only come from 
having five children. Countess De Lage is a fre
quently tipsy, rather large, woman who has had 
four previous husbands She floats around the
stage lending her advice on love to anyone who 
will listen. As you can guess, few do. However, 
it is the antics of Sylvia and Crystal that really 
bring out the flavor of The Women. These ladies 
could give Joan Collins lessons on how to be 
a bitch. These women don't just get a manicure, 
they get de-clawed. The repartee between these 
two characters and the rest of the cast is alone 
worth the price of admission. It is hilarious. 
There is a scene in which the ladies gang up 
on the woman who stole Mary's husband. The 
scene was like feeding time at the lions cage 
in the zoo. All of the characters were delightfully 
catty.
Actually, The Women is at its best when its 
characters are being catty, which is most of the 
time. Clare Boothe Luce wrote The Women as 
a satire of the society in which she lived. Luce 
takes aim at this portion of society who finds 
an almost perverse pleasure at the misfortune 
of others; the heartless and the destructive. 
Luce hits her target with striking accuracy.
All of the performances in this play are top 
notch. Janice Lynn Clark is charming, warm 
and credible as Mary. The fact that Mary can 
endure the acid-tongue remarks of her friends 
allows the audience to accept them more easi
ly. She provides the necessary contrast to the 
cats' that allows the play to succeed instead of 
wallowing in cynicism. Kim Anne Connolly is 
magnificent as Countess De Lage. Ms. Connol
ly has a flair for comedy and the character adds 
some wonderful, light hearted moments to The 
Women. All of Ms. Connollys scenes were 
hysterical. Anne Altieris Crystal, magnificent
ly malicious, is definitely a woman youll love 
to hate. If anyone steals the show, though, its 
Anne Capron as the tigress Sylvia. Wearing 
leopard skin for almost the entire performance, 
Sylvia walks the stage like a cat waiting to strike. 
Sylvia is less malicious than Crystal but no less 
heartless. She is probably more dangerous as
Sylvia and Crystal bitching it up.
a friend than as an enemy. Ms. Caprons Sylvia 
is devilishly cunning and capricious - Joan Col
lins had better watch out.
The Women is, not surprisingly, comprised of 
an entirely female cast. All of the women are 
wonderful and the production is first rate. A.S 
Reynolds set is stylish and sophisticated. It 
definitely adds to the visual appeal of the play. 
Terri L. Flukes costumes were also stunning. 
The 1930s never looked so good. Lee
Sankowich expertly brings everything together 
into a brilliant, funny play.
The Women runs at the Kresge Theatre 
through February 22. The fact that it's right 
here on campus means that students dont have 
to travel very far or face the harsh winter to ex
perience an enjoyable night at the theater. Stu
dent discounts make the price of admission 
comparable to going to a movie. The Women is 
fine theater and is very, very funny.

Butt Rockin Music From the Fabulous Thunderbirds
By BRUCE KASREL
Tartan Entertainment Editor
The Fabulous Thunderbirds 
Tuff Enuff 
CBS Records
After almost twenty years of playing in seedy 
bars and night clubs, The Fabulous Thunder
birds have finally made it big. With the highly 
promoted release of their latest album, Tuff 
Enuff\ as well as a national tour, (they are the 
opening act for Stevie Ray Vaughan) The 
Fabulous Thunderbirds have found a vehicle 
to obtain the kind of attention their musical 
talents merit.
The Thunderbirds are a rhythm and blues 
band that mix classic 50s style rhythms with 
inventive and original lyrics. An exact descrip
tion of their sound is difficult to pinpoint, yet 
lead guitarist Jimmie Vaughan describes the 
band: Weve got soul or something. It sounds 
authentic. Were not even really a blues band. 
We can play the hell out of the blues, and we 
do, every night. But we play American music. 
Were more of a dance band, a party band, a 
rock'nroll band.
Often mis-classified as rockabilly revivalists, 
a more exact term might be bluesabilly, these 
greased-backed hair rockers are musically more 
on the order of the immortal Paul Butterfield 
Blues Band: vocalists and harmonica player 
Kim Wilson sings, plays, and even looks like 
Butterfield, and admits that Butterfield was his 
first inspiration. Also drawing their sound from 
Gulf Coast bluesmen like Big Walter Price-who 
lead the Thunderbirds (not the fabulous) in the 
50s and 60s, Slim Harpo. and Lazy Lester.
To say that the Fabulous Thunderbirds copy 
or imitate these famed musicians of the past
would be wrong. Instead of just rehashing the 
past, the Thunderbirds create a new sound bylaying down a strong, hard foundation set up 
by bassist Preston Hubbard and drummer Fram 
Christina; combine it with soulful ly rics, sing
ing, and the play of Wilson; and icing it off with 
the articulate and emotion packed guitar licks 
of Vaughan. The result is a sound that is finetuned R&B with groovin' dance rhythms mix
ed in.
I got my first taste of what the Thuderbirds 
are all about when I saw and heard them per
form at the Syria Mosque on January 24th. 
There is no hype with these guys, they just get 
up on stage and rock your socks off. With their 
butt-kickin rocknroll and blues-inspired 
ballads, the Thunderbirds had everyone in the 
Syria Mosque clapping and dancing about wild
ly. I was astonished, to say the least, and rush
ed to the nearest record store to buy their latest 
album. Sadly, I must report that the Thunder
birds suffer a mild case of sound-better-livesyndrome. The album, Tuff Enujf. is vintage 
dance rhythm and blues, but it just doesn't cap
ture the spectacular sounds that these guys can 
produce when placed in front of a few thousand 
screaming and dancing fans.
The album title track begins the album with 
a strong drum beat which slowly blends in with 
a smooth and simple guitar lick. Bring in Kim
Wilson's lyrics and velvety voice and you have 
a sure-fire dance hit. Tell Me, a very- upbeat 
and light standard by Sidney Simien and Ed
die Shuler, introduces the harmonica-playing 
aspect of Wilson. Wilson and the rest of the 
band don't stay very far from the original 
rhythm, which gives the song a rather tired and 
stale feeling to it. The third track, Look at That, 
Look at That, is definitely the best of the 
original songs on the album. Without the hin
drance of a chorus or catchy lyrics, the real 50's 
rockn'roll style of the Thunderbirds shines 
through. With the extra spunk and musical 
tones that piano player Chuck Leavell adds, the 
song moves and grooves nicely.
The only ballad on this release is Two Time 
My Lovin, which extends the range of Wilson's 
vocals to the limit. His hearty vocals like:
I found out you've got somebody else 
But I love you baby and I just can't help myself 
I can't let you go it's plain as day to see 
I'm gonna have to let you two time me 
are a refreshing change of pace in todays mono
syllabically filled rock'nroll scene.
every track, Wilson's ebullient harp playing fills 
the gaps where something fresh is missing, he 
will knock you dead in Down at Antones. The 
blues great Muddy Waters once said, Kim 
Wilson is the best harp player in the world to
day.
Tuff Enuff. like the previous Thunderbirds 
releases, has a sense of humor about it. In Why 
Get Up Wilson laments about the pressures of 
the world, and asks the question that every one 
who has had an 8:30 class can relate to:
Why get up
How can I get up
Why should I get up
This whole world's gone crazy
Think I have seen enough
I'm gonna sleep forever
Why get up.
These playful lyrics along with the bands ex
aggerated snoring noises in the background 
arous a humorous aspect that the rest of the 
album lacks. However, the snoring does get an
noying when superimposed over Vaughans 
superb. Chuck Berry-like guitar solo.
Tuff Enuff may not be a good representation 
of what these guys sound like five, but it still 
is a heck of an album. While your listening to 
it be careful: your feet will start tapping, hips 
will begin to swirl, and soon the rest of you will 
be bouncing all over the room. This album is 
a must for party-tape composers and anyone 
who loves to let the music make you get up and 
dance.
Not to take anything away from Wilson's 
soulful singing, the real heart of his artistic talent 
resides in his harmonica playing. In almost

v . .. ...   /,  ......................... . m*. : .Carlin to bring own brand of comedy to the Syria Mosque
Comedian George Carlin will appear at the Syria Mosque on Feb. 28.
At Forbes: Computer Art
By AMANDA COHEN
Tartan Comedy Reviewer
George Carlin, a leader among comedians will 
be performing at the Syria mosque onFebruary 
28. He is bringing his patented style of com
edy to Pittsburgh, and local fans expect an 
outstanding show.
Sprung from a Catholic schooling in the fif
ties, the Class Clown learned to elicit laughter 
from his peers early as a student. He loved to 
go for the suppressed laughter of the classroom 
situation. Venture a guess as to what it must 
have been like to have a future king of bodily 
noises sitting next to you during an exam. Un
fortunately. he would often find himself severely 
punished for such improper behavior, and even
tually left school because of it.
So logically he went into professional comedy. 
He began as a disk jockey, and in 1959 went 
to work with Jack Burns (who would later work 
with Avery Schreiver). They eventually did a 
morning radio show together, while perform
ing as a comedy team by night. This schedule 
of working till two in the morning and then hav
ing to be up again by six is probably familiar 
to most students. Being funny on a schedule 
like this can be a strain.
They stopped working together in 1962. and 
Carlin took his own stand-up into the sixties and 
seventies, where it grew like weed. He made 
many television appearances, and worked on 
live shows as well. In certain clubs, he would 
be harassed for using off-color words and 
language commonly deemed offensive, and in 
1972 he was arrested for using this part of the 
English language in a show where young 
children were present. The words were part of 
a routine called Seven Words You Can Never 
Say On Television, which has since become 
a classic, and has been much expanded upon. 
A more complete list appears in Carlins book 
of leftover lines, 'Sometimes a Little Brain
Damage Can Help.
After the free-speech incident, Carlin found 
that playing to college audiences afforded him 
the freedom to use his complete repertoire. He 
began cutting albums of his stand-up comedy, 
which by then had developed its distinctive 
style. His material ranges from definitive parody 
to bawdy sound effects to artistic wordplay and 
constants queries to humanity in general: Did 
you ever wonder why the Rice Krispies highest 
on the bowl dry first? All of this is performed 
with spotless delivery and a host of characters 
scattered about for appropriate situations.
Carlin can take the simplest concept, like 
maintaining a refrigerator as in his popular 
Icebox Man, and take every tiny detail to very 
funny extremes. All of his older material is by 
now fine-tuned to near perfection, and Carlin 
continues to produce new material. His creative 
base is a multi-media studio which allows him 
to write, develop and produce his own art. He 
has produced some video pieces and his recent 
albums feature some studio-recorded pieces, 
like the popular Book Club" and An Inter
view with Jesus.
But Carlin is not forsaking stand-up.......hell
be doing it again on Friday the 28th at the Syria 
Mosque. Old fans can most likely expect an 
amount of his standard material, with some new 
material in for the originality, and possibly even 
some sketch-oriented non-stand-up bits. New 
fans can be sure that they are in for a great show 
at the very least.

Special to The Tartan 
When one thinks of the art being produced 
on campus one usually considers objects like 
the sculpture that occasionally is seen outside 
on the Cut; there is a great tendency to think 
of art in traditional terms: sculpture, painting, 
printmaking. However, Carnegie Mellon is high 
tech university. The administration is always 
talking about state of the art.
The Forbes Gallery is talking about a different 
kind of State of the Art. For the annual high 
tech show, which opens tonight at 7 pm and 
runs through Sunday, February 23, the Forbes
Gallery gathered everything from computer 
chips and electron microscope photographs to 
a video totem pole. It isnt all produced using 
high tech equipmentsome of it is just about 
high technology. You may never feel the same 
about computers again.
Perhaps the most interesting thing about State 
of the Art is that it gathers work which normal
ly would not be seen by a gallery audience. 
Amber Dailey and Rod Strychor, for instance, 
are showing photographs taken with a transmis
sion electron microscope. The photographs

ThursdayLady Sings the Blues
This is the biography of singer Billie Holiday 
as told by Diana Ross, well almost. Ross stars 
as Ms. Holiday but the film lacks historical fact 
about the late singer or even about music of the 
1940s. If you dont care about details, then 
< the film wont bother you. Ross is good, but the 
real Billie Holiday was much more than this film 
paints her out to be. This film is strictly for 
Diana Ross fans. Directed by Sidney Furie.
TARTAN MOVIE GRADE 2.75
FridaySilverado
A tongue-in-cheek western that offers a surpris
ingly high quality cast. Its sort of The Magnifi cent Seven, Minus Three as Kevin Kline leads 
a group of four well-meaning souls who aid the 
town of Silverado from viscious Brian Dennehey 
and his gang. Lawrence Kasdans direction is 
uneven at times but there are a number of fun
ny scenes which make the movie enjoyable. 
John Cleese plays a dandy English sheriff 
and Linda Hunt is a diminutive saloon Keeper. 
Definitely the average western.
TARTAN MOVIE GRADE 3.50
Saturday1984
George Orwells novel is remarkably brought 
to life in Michael Redfords brilliant film. The 
story is probably one of the most widely read 
and this film does justice to Orwells visions. 
The film was created to reflect Orwells version 
of the future, not our own present. Orwells hero 
Winston Smith, played by John Hurt, lives in 
a world of grim and crushing humanity, of 
bombed factories and of citizens desperate for 
the most simple pleasures. Enter a girl named 
Julia (Suzanna Hamilton) who gives Winston a 
note that says simply I love you and Richard 
Burton as the immensely cynical Inner par
ty member, OBrien. This film finds the novels 
darkest side and reveals it with striking reality.

Richard Wallace used a computer to take a 
picture of a face and enlarge it to enormous size. 
The picture, which uses four pixels per page, 
will cover a large portion of a wall. Another com
puter artist, Andrew Singer, will be using an Ap
ple Macintosh to play music of his own com
position; the Mac will also be used for computer 
games during the show. Singer is also showing 
a Super 8 film called Hacker Breakdown." 
which takes place entirely in the Hunt Library 
Macintosh Center.
Andy Cook is filling the back room of the 
gallerv with a video totem pole: seven televisions 
in various states of repair showing two different 
videos. Chris Gray will be exhibiting a reaction 
to high technology; three series of photographs 
which show plastic toys in traumatic situations. 
"Eskimo Battle. for instance, has plastic toys 
in combat in a freezer. The toys are also shown 
in a dishwasher, and Barbie and Gl Joe, in a 
trip to England, drown in the Thames and are 
eaten by cows. State of the Art is a rare oppor
tunity indeed to see art which both utilizes and 
reacts to high technology. It only happens once 
a vear. so don't miss it.

Strategies for success
Features
By KATHY MURTAUGH
Tartan Staffwriter
Strategies for Success, a career conference 
for women, sponsored by Chevrolet, was held 
last weekend at Pittsburghs Hilton.
Featuring dynamic speakers from all over the 
country, the conference focused on womens 
concerns as they face the challenges of the 
changing work force.
Barbara Soriano, author and educator, forcasted job trends which will occur as technology 
alters the work place.
According to Ms. Soriano, there are economic 
trends taking place of which women should be 
aware.
She predicts that the United States will no 
longer be a major manufacturing employer 
although it might remain a major manufactur
ing country.
In the 1960s, 22% of the work force was 
based in manufacturing. This statistic has drop
ped to 15% toddy, and will plummet to 
8%-ll% by the vear 2000.
Ms. Soriano explained, As companies enter 
into industry, wage scales rise. When wage 
scales rise, products become more expensive 
and other countries enter the market. She cited 
Japan as an example of this, in the automobile 
industry.
GM has, on board, plans for getting entire
ly out of the automobile industry by the year 
2000, she added. According to Ms. Soriano,
GM will form companies dealing with technology 
and robotics.
In order for companies to maintain com- As women begin to work at home again, say

machinery. Soriano.
According to Soriano, there will be a new flux According to Ms. Soriano, several things 
of workers into information-based and service- could work in the opposite direction, as well, 
based industries. Due to great advancements She believes that people will require an office

in her opinion, that makes attitudes toward which could be used, also, to entertain business 
women in the workplace difficult to forecast, guests.
Speaker at Strategies Seminar
If we keep our feet in both worlds, we will 
be inclined to draw the line between household 
and business time within the home. she stated.
As information bases become more and more 
expert, people will not, according to Soriano be 
valued by what information they possess for in
formation will be stored on computers. People 
will learn to use computers through interactive 
video education to gain access to information.
What does this mean to workers? According 
to Ms. Soriano, it means that people will no 
longer work in groups concerned with specific 
subjects. It will be easier to work across groups. 
For example, a health service worker can readi
ly work with and architect or lawyer.
What will make people marketable is not 
their information; but people-oriented skills, 
stated Soriano. According to her, it will be more 
important to be sensitive to others needs, to 
be a good listener, and to team well with others.
Technology will come in at an ever increas
ing rate. The cycle for change is getting shorter 
and we must consider that for the rest of our 
lives we will be learning technology, said 
Soriano.
Because of technology, we will be granted the 
freedom to try entirely new things simply 
because we like the field. According to Soriano, 
we will no longer be afraid to try new things 
because we can't retain the necessary 
information.
She explained, There will be people on your 
team with in-depth knowledge who prefer not 
to deal with people and will require your com
munication skills to sell a product or service. 
By 1995, 75% of all married couples will be 
working and are likely to have children. Soriano 
stated, A whole range of services will be re
quired by these couples such as grocery shop
ping and child care.
Although such services might be demanded 
and indeed profitable, one might wonderwhy 
bother to obtain a college degree? Ms. Soriano 
emphasized that college instills certain problem 
solving skills essential to success.
We can learn from History and Art to com
pare. History will be something we enjoy rather 
than a regurgitation of facts.
According to Soriano, these academic 
disciplines will develop more effective com
municators who are sensitive to what societys 
needs are and aware of developing trends. She 
advised women to scan their environment, listen 
to what peoples needs are, and think of ser
vices to fulfuill those needs.
Ms. Soriano, who believes that women have, 
in general, possessed greater interpersonal skills 
and sensitivity concluded her lecture, I am 
very glad that women are finally going to be paid 
for something theyve done well for a long 
time.
Happy hearts, lonely hearts
By CHRISTY CASAMASSIMA
Tartan Feature's Editor
If vou had a lonely heart this Valentine s 
Day, you were not alone. Although seme con
tend that Christmas can be the loneliest holi
day, I disagreeValentines has got to top the 
list.
If you werent with your sweetheart, or if you 
dont happen to have one, Valentine s Day may 
have been more painful to you than a shot with 
cupids bow.
But consider the bright side:
First of all, vou werent sucked into the con
sumer aspect of the holiday. The greeting card 
industry made no profits from your end; the 
w riters had to peddle their sap to some other 
Valentine victim who had no choice but to 
choose from the overpriced assortment of 
Hallmarks. And what about those chocolates.'* 
^ ou should be thankful that no one thought to 
send vou a 5 lb. box of delicious hand dipped 
chocolates. What would that do to your diet.'* 
Besides. Ladv Godiva happens to be doing well 
enough without vou. Think of all the money you 
saved on lacev lingerie or bright red boxers 
youve alwavs considered red underwear tacky 
any wav.
Now vour roomate has to contend with 
<lisciphcring the hidden messages underlying 
his/her Valentine's card; what s worse it s from 
an anonvmous admirer. 1 guess I m luckv 
l>ecause I don't have to deal with these com
plexities of love.
So if the most romantic \ alentrne vou ret icv
o
O
o
ed was from your little brother or sister, do not 
dismay. At least your little sibling doesn't de
mand anything.
Just think, only about three hundred sixty one 
days until next Valentines Dayby then you 
might be able to come up with a sweetheart.
Imagine what fun it will 
happy loving couple that 
sick to their stomach.

makes everyone else

Double visitors score. . .
Natators do complete turnaround; swim past W&J
By STEW LEVINE
Tartan Staffwriter
The Swimming Tartans got back on track last 
week defeating Washington and Jefferson
70-35 in Men's Swimming and 74-35 in 
Women's Swimming. A complete turnaround 
from Grove City was how Coach Donna 
Moroskv described the meet.
The men jumped to a quick lead taking top 
slots in four of the first five events to lead 35-8. 
Winners were the 400 medley relay team of 
Doug Biesecker, Doug Lindblad, Hal Levine, 
and Chris Leech; Rob Summers in the mile 
freestyle with a time of 18:31.35 seconds; Steve 
Francis in the 200 freestyle, and Mike Fit
zgerald in the 200 individual medley.
John Carroll made up some ground, taking 
advantage of the men's lack of divers. However, 
outside of that, it was all Tartans, taking five 
of the final six swimming events.
Greg Schooley started CMU with a victory in 
the 200 freestyle. He was followed by Dan Ur
ban in the 200 backstroke, Fitzgerald in the 
500 freestyle, Lindblad in the 200 breaststroke, 
and the 400 freestyle relay team of Levine, 
Summers, Fitzgerald, and Whitney Foster.
The women also had an easy time taking the 
first nine events of the meet to build a comman
ding 56-20 lead. The victors included the 400 
medley relay team of Suzie Keyy, Carol Pampino, Nancy Ott, and Amy Stempel.
Patty Illig took the mile freestyle, lapping two 
W&J swimmers in the process; Stempel won the 
200 freestyle; Pampino was victorious in the 
200 individual medley; Carol Fruend bested all 
divers.
Other winners were Francesca Crannel in the 
100 freestyle with a personal best of 58.36 
seconds; Kelly in the 100 backstroke; Jill 
Werner in the 100 breaststroke; and the 400 
freestyle relay team of Keyy, Illig, Freund, and 
Crannell.
This was the final home meet of the season 
as well as the final meet of the PAC season. The 
Tartans honored their three departing seniors 
Chris Leech. Dan Urban, and Patty Illig, each 
of whom won at least one event that day.
Carnegie Mellon finds itself now at 8-1 with 
only last weeks match-up against Slippery Rock 
between the squad and the PAC Championships
at John Carroll.
"The women are weak in numbers, but strong
in performance and ability. Weve beaten all 
the women in the Conference except John Car
roll. The only thing stopping us is numbers, our 
ability is much better than any other team.
For the men, Grove City is the team to beat. 
Well lose points in the diving, they could take 
up to 60 points in that alone. Weve got a good 
shot at second, but on any given day...
Defeating Washington and Jefferson, Last Wednesday, were the swim teams. The mens 400 medley team copped first palce honors. The natators will travel to Silippery Rock this Wednesday.

Tartan Sports Editor
Taking a commanding lead in the A Divi
sion of the Majors basketball League, the ATO 
Wolfpack went 1-1 on the week to up their 
record to 6-1. Both Beta-A and the Skywalkers 
share the second place honors. On the flip side, 
the Pretty Boys lead the pack at 5-2, followed 
closely by the City Kids and Pika-A.
Four divisions of the Intermediate League 
boast leaders with 3-0 records. The Alabama 
Slammers, Kappa Sigma-B, and the Yanks lead 
the A, B, and C sections, respectively, 
while Buster Highmen and the Math Grads top 
all competition on the E side. At 2-0, the 
Crabs hold the red ribbon in the A Division, 
and the UDS Lakers fell just short of first in the 
"B Division.
Betas Wooglin Five tallied the most wins of 
the week, as they lead the D Division, with 
the Sudsuckers and the Touring Machine nip
ping closely at their heels.

Despite loss9 pucksters look for playoff position
By PERRY PIERCE
Tartan Staffwriter
The Ice Tartans split in the week's action, 
beating IUP 3-0, and dropping a tough desision to the Golden Knights of Gannon 3-2.
Carnegie Mellon, coming off a bad week los
ing twice to Bowling Green, was ready to bouce 
back, as the Tartans came up with a big con
ference win in the Western Pennsylvania 
Hockey Association. The pucksters now have 
a 9-4 record in the conference, and hold a 
strong third place behind Duquense, and the 
University of Pittsburgh. The Tartans will take 
on these conference powerhouses in the near 
future, as the season winds down to a precious 
few games. Carnegie Mellon is a shoe-in for the 
playoffs, though, as the top four teams make 
it to post season play.
The Tartans lost a very tough game to Gan
non College despite playing their best game of 
the year. The Tartans had support from Rob 
Katz, scoring on a breakaway in the second 
period. For Katz, that was his third goal in two 
games, and his eleventh on the year. The other 
Tartan red light was on a shorthanded goal
scored by sophomore Greg Timmons on a pass 
from Mark Licata to knot the game at two a 
piece at the end of the second period. Carnegie 
Mellons power play units had their best game 
of the year, keeping the puck in the Gannon 
zone for the full two minutes. But the game was 
decided in the third period, as Gannon scored 
on a questionable play, where the net became 
unanchored. Tartan goaltender Ron Bonnasso 
was quite disturbed by the call of the referees, 
but the goal stood, and was the difference in 
the game.
Carnegie Mellon and IUP were quite evenly  
matched, as the Tartans tried unsuccessfully to 
outskate a surpising IUP defense. IUP always 
plays us tough, said Tartan wing Tommy 
Hughes, explaining that the game was not to be 
taken too lightly. The IUP defense played very 
well, but let the Tartans get a lot of shots on 
net, as Carnegie Mellon outshot IUP by a 35-21 
count.
The first period went by fast, as the teams 
played very evenly for the first six minutes of 
the game. At the 7 minute mark, just after IUP 
wasted off a power play opportunity for the Tar
tans, Rob Katz took a pass from Don Heyse 
from behind the net and shot it by IUP goalie 
Frank Cone. Katz explained Donny [Heyse] 
got it [the puck] behind the net from Bobby 
[Koch] and fed me out in front. I took a shot 
from about ten feet and got the puck between 
his legs." With that goal, Carnegie Mellon was 
able to keep control of the puck for the re
mainder of the period and hold their 1-0 lead.
Tartan goaltender Ron Bonnasso had another 
good game in goal for the Tartans, and was able 
to get the shutout. Bonnasso had a slightly pull
ed groin muscle in the games against Bowling 
Green, and felt very good for this week. I came 
very ready to play, explained Bonnasso. The 
Tartans were able to give Bonnasso a lot of pro
tection, as the defense played one of their best 
games of the year. The defense played a great 
game, commented Tartan coach Dr. John 
Polomsky. Coach Polomsky also commented on 
the play of his fourth and fifth lines, saying that 
they helped keep our first, second, and third 
lines very fresh. We need that kind of help later 
on in the season with the big games coming up.
I hope to work them in as a bigger part of our 
game very soon.
The teams skated fairly evenly in the second 
period, as Carnegie Mellon was able to control 
the puck for the greater part of the period. In 
the third period, Carnegie Mellon was finally 
able to capitalize on the power play, as at the 
7:45 mark of the period, scoring sensation Greg 
Timmons took a backhand shot that beat IUP 
goalie Cone to give the Tartans a 2-0 lead. Tim
mons got help from Ken Smith and Rob Katz 
on the play, as they set Timmons out front only 
a few feet from the net. Play continued to be 
quite clean, as the teams played a game of 
skating, not hitting. But with only one minute 
left in the game, Rob Katz tallied his tenth red 
light of the year on a breakaway lead pass from 
Don Heyse to give the Tartans an insurmoun
table 3-0 lead. Katz explained that IUP had 
good covering up front[of the net] all game. 
Carnegie Mellon also was successful in pulling 
out the IUP defensemen a lot, as Tartan 
defenders in front the of the IUP net constant
ly caused IUP to break their intended defen
sive scheme.

Hoopsters clobbered by John Carroll; drop to ,500
Marietta for their non-Conference game, and 
played a contest very similar to their loss against 
John Carroll.
The match started out close with neither team 
able to get a sizeable lead early on. However, 
with 10 minutes left in the stanza the Tartans 
go cold allowing the hosts to build a 32-19 
lead with just under six minutes remaining. 
CMU was able to close the gap to 40-30 bv the 
half.
As the second half started, the two teams trad
ed baskets for the first few minutes. The 
Tartans fell into the trap they fell into against 
Grove City and John Carroll: poor shooting.
Mariettas lead hit 23 at 10:08 and the home 
squad never looked back. The Tartans shot only 
36.5% from the floor in the second half, and 
38.3% for the whole game, as well as 47.2% 
from the foul line.
Two Tartans had good efforts against Mariet
ta. Coleman led CMU with 15 points and 12 
rebounds. Freshman forward Daren Moffatt, in 
a rare starting appearance, added 11 points and 
9 rebounds.
Carnegie Mellon heads into its final week of 
the season with games Tuesday night at home

The season for the Tartans ended at John Car
roll Wednesday when Carnegie Mellon got clob
bered 94-62 dropping them to 9-9 and 5-5 in 
the PAC, three games behind John Carroll and 
Thiel, with only two games remaining in the 
season. Earlier in the week the Tartans also 
dropped a non-Conference matchup 91-66 to 
Marietta.
John Carroll opened the game with a Craig 
Huffman bucket to take a lead that Carnegie 
Mellon would only be able to tie once in the 
entire game.
From the start, the Blue Streaks outplayed the 
Tartans, rising to a 17-8 lead with 13:08 re
maining when Head Coach Larry Anderson 
called time out. The rest seemed to get CMU 
back on track, when the Tartans led by Richard 
Neff and Hart Coleman, tied the game at 22-22 
with 7:40 left in the first half.
The game remained close as the two squads 
traded buckets until the final three minutes 
w hen John Carroll pulled ahead with a 12 point 
run to take a 41-28 lead at the buzzer.
In the second half the Blue Streaks pulled 
ahead combining good shooting, solid reboun
ding, and a tenacious defense that provided 14
steals.
John Carroll extended its lead to 29 with 
10:05 and would only see that lead drop below 
29 for 23 seconds the rest of the way.
The Tartans were led by another solid per
formance by sophomore center Hart Coleman 
who was seven of nine from the floor with 18 
points and 11 rebounds. Richard Neff hit seven 
of 10 to add 14, and Dave Bart contributed 10.

Compiles 77-15-2 record in 10 rears
Klausing named assistanthead coach at Pitt
By JOHN FRIEDMANN
Tartan Business Manager
Chuck Klausing, Carnegie Mellon's head foot
ball coach for the past ten years, this week ac
cepted a position as assistant head coach at Pitt 
under new head coach Mike Gottfried.
He will be replaced by Rich Lackner, who 
has served as an assistant under Klausing since 
his graduation from Carnegie Mellon in 1978. 
Lackner will be the 18th head coach in 
CMU/Carnegie Tech history.
Klausing compiled an impressive 77-15-2 
record during his tenure as CMU head coach, 
a winning percentage of .830, the best in Tar
tan history. He guided the Tartans to six PAC 
championships and four NCAA playoff berths. 
He received national recognition for his work 
at CMU, being voted Small College Coach-ofthe-Year in both 1979 and 1983. During his 
38 year coaching career, Klausing has never 
had a single losing season.
Athletic Director Jim Banner had nothing but 
praise for Klausing's work at CMU. Hes done 
a tremendous job for us over the last ten years, 
as his record states...We wish him well in his 
new endeavors.
The players seemed disappointed to lose 
Klausing, but wished him well. Defensive back 
Dave Elias said it was Unfortunate that we 
have to lose two outstanding coaches [Klausing 
and Poluzek], but Im happy that they are go
ing to places where football is treated with some 
respect."* Co-Captain and quarterback Mike 
Hensel commented I respect the outstanding 
job he did considering the dismal facilities they 
had to work with.
Ron Orie, a senior and also a co-captain, call
ed Coach Klausings departure one of both
ly things will work out for him at Pitt, the same 
way things will work out at CMU under Coach 
Lackner.
Other team members were also optimistic 
about Lackners leadership. Hensel is confi
dent the team will do well under the cir
cumstances, losing the head coach and the 
defensive coordinator of six years. Lackner has 
the drive and determination to succeed. He was 
a learned understudy under a great mentor.
Klausing seemed upbeat about his new posi
tion. I m happy to come to the University of 
Pittsburgh to help Mike Gottfried produce a win
ner...! welcome challenges.
leaving the team in good hands. He [Lackner] 
has proven...hes a person that deserves this op
portunity. Im happy for the players. 
Lackner in turn lauded Klausing. I feel like 
I"m following a legend. Coach Klausing is the 
Bear Bryant of Division III football.
Lackner was the obvious choice to succeed 
Klausing. Athletic Director Banner indicated 
that he wanted to promote someone already 
associated with the CMU program, and that
Lackner was the first person he had approach
ed with the position.
New head coach Rich Lackner has been 
associated with Carnegie Mellon football for the
past 11 seasons, all but the first under Chuck 
Klausing. He was a four year letterman for the 
Tartans, a three time All-PAC linebacker, and 
a co-captain of 1978 CMU playoff team. 
Lackner was also twice selected as an Academic 
All-American, and the Post Gazette presented 
him with a Dapper Dan award following his 
senior year.After earning his Bachelors degree in 1978. 
Lackner serv ed as a Tartan assistant linebacker 
coach until 1982, when he took over the offen
sive line. In 1984. Lackner was promoted to 
offensive coordinator, and was shifted to defen
sive coordinator last month when Don Poluzek
left to take an assistants job at Marshall University.
Lackner did not foresee many immediate^ 
changes in the football program. He indicated 
that there would not be a shake-up of the 
coaching staff, although he is looking for for 
another full time assistant coach and one or 
two part-time assistants.
Lackner did note that his field strategies 
would not be a carbon copy of Klausings. I 
have observed his tactics over the years, but 
I can't say Im the same person as Coach Klaus
ing.
One of the factors that made Klausing so suc
cessful at CMU is his recruiting ability, a factor* 
that may have played a part in Gottfrieds selec
tion. Klausing did nothing to dispel that notion, 
noting that Ive recruited the WPIAL for 38 
years and I have made many good friends. He 
expressed confidence in CMUs future 
recruiting prospects, despite his departure and 
the loss of Don Poluzek, who had also been ac
tive in the recruiting process. Lackner has 
worked with me in recruiting...[CMU] wont 
miss a step.
Womens hoop squad clinches 71-70 thriller over Carlow
By JILL DORSON
Tartan Sports Editor
It was nothing short of a thriller, last Satur
day, in the Skibo Gym, as the Womens Varsi
ty Hoop Squad clinched a 71-70 victory over 
Carlow College in the last seconds of play. Each 
team played spectacular ball, with the coaches 
putting the right players in the places. Both fans 
and players agreed, however, that the officiating 
was far from impressive.
The contest opened up with Carlow taking a 
quick 7-4 lead in the first two minutes. The 
visitors' margin would set the tempo for the re
mainder of the half, as Carnegie Mellon 
repeatedly found itself playing catch-up.
Possession bounced back and forth, as the 
teams tallied alternately, with Carlow keeping 
that three-point edge, until the 13:40 mark. The 
hosts seemed to fall apart briefly, as Carlow 
went on a scoring binge, dropping in four 
unanswered buckets, upping the score to 22-11.
The Tartans called a time-out to regroup and 
came up with two on the in-bounds play. Senior 
co-captain Nancy Dilulio initiated the play, but 
was fouled. Again, she brought the sphere down 
with the help of freshman Roseanna Neupauer. 
Neupauer eventually shot from outside, giving 
shantout Beth Virgin the offensive board. Virgin 
was fouled and proceeded to sink two perfect 
shots from the line.
Carlow answered right back with two, but star 
Lisa Lightner wasnt willing to give in. On the 
rebound, Lightner dribbled around-the-back 
and down the court to let loose for a 27-footer 
that swished ' in.
The Tartans scored again seconds later, as 
freshman Allison Guy came off the bench to tear 
down a rebound leaving Neupauer and Lightner 
to the offense. Lightner drove through the crowd 
beneath the basket for yet another score.At 9:09, Neupauer kept her teams 100 percent ioul shot record alive, as she neatly netted
both her attempts.
Junior guard Valerie Sooky followed the tally
ing trend, upping the score to 22-21, putting 
the hosts within one.
Carlow finally got a shot off, but the Tartans 
kept the visitors in check in the form of a hot 
Allison Guy.
Foul shots from Neupauer eventually put the 
hosts ahead, but the lead was won and lost 
several times before the stanza ended.
Down by one, 28-27, Lightner tapped off a 
jump ball to Virgin, who threw a bullet downcourt to a waiting Sooky for a picture-perfect 
lay-up. As the squads exchanged tallies, sud
denly the score was tied at 31 apiece.
Mellon basket of the half, closing out the stan
za at 39-33, Carlow.
Neupauer, Lightner, and Reber tallied a com
bined total of 21 of their squads first half 
points, while Allison guy dominated the 
boareds, garnering eight caroms.
Play throughout the second half looked much 
like that of the first: the squads exchanged 
buckets, while Carlow kept a small edge.
Scoring came from around the court and 
across the team, as Lightner, Guy, Neupauer, 
Sparrow and Sooky all tried to keep Carnegie 
Mellon in the game.
With only 2:04 left to play, and Carlow still 
up by two, the contest broke wide open. Going
the same play, the Carlow coach was served a 
technical foul by the referees.
Virgin stood alone at the line to sink four con
secutive foul shots. Only three of these shots 
were counted, however, as the ref somehow 
miscounted.
At this point, Lightner was 11-for-11 at the 
line, and upped her teams score to 69-one 
point ahead of Carlow.
Try as they might, the visitors just couldnt 
get a shot off, but then again, neither could the 
Tartans; the tension was mounting as the home 
squad called a time-out.
Returning to the Court, Carlow took im
mediate possession and ultimately tallied, put
ting them ahead, 70-69, with only 15 seconds 
to play.
Carlow made the gravest error possible in this 
situation, as Neupauer, who had been hitting 
consistently from the line, was fouled. The 
freshman standout hit both her shots cleanly, 
giving her teammates a one-point edge.
At the nine second mark, Coach Gerri Seild 
called a Carnegie Mellon time-out. Whatever 
she said, worked-at the buzzer, Carlow still 
hadn't hit, and the Tartans were victorious,
71-70.
The hoopsters will host Conference rival Thiel 
College, Tuesday in a 6:00 p.m. tip-off. Over 
the weekend, the squad will travel to Bethan) 
for their final confrontation of the 1985- 
season.
it was a hot day for the Tartans, as four 
hoopsters broke into the double figuresLightner led the pack with 18 tallies, while 
classmate Virgin dropped in 17. Aimee Reber 
and Neupauer had five baskets apiece.
Defensively, standout Guy tore down an DT1 
pressive 13 caroms, while Virgin had 1^ 
Lightner showed her true colors with ninf 
boards.
