Lab Air Circulation 
Needs Improvements
by Elliot Ohlberg
This is the second half of an article 
examining the environmental quality of the 
air in selected campus areas. Last week's 
installment dealt primarily with the printmaking studios in the Coal Research 
Building. This one looks at sculpture, 
ceramics, chemistry, and engineering.
Its probably not possible to have suffi
cient ventilation, decided one sculpture 
student. Some students just dont clean 
up properly, said another.
The main sculpture area in Doherty Hall 
is a large, two-story tall room where art 
students apply a variety of sculpting 
techniques. It is not uncommon to walk 
into the area at a busy time and become 
somewhat nauseated from an interesting
O-C Housing 
Consolidates
The Off-Campus Housing Office an
nounced that it is consolidating with the 
University of Pittsburgh Off-Campus Hous
ing Office to form one unit and provide 
better facilities. The new service, Universi
ty Off-Campus Housing, will be operated 
from the Pitt Student Union Building and 
will offer extensive housing files and free 
telephones to contact landlords and real
tors.
The present office in Skibo 56 will 
remain open and assist in advising CMU 
students and staff. It will also keep a hous
ing list of units open only to the CMU 
community.
With the consolidation, more printed 
material and programs will be made avail
able to CMU. A Pitt publication, Guide 
to Off-Campus Housing, is being up-dated 
to provide information on financial agree
ments, leases, subletting, termination, evic
tion, and the rights of tenants for the 
campus community. There will also be a 
seminar on off-campus housing at each 
University.
In the future, the Office hopes to pro
vide recorded housing lists for people call
ing from outside the Pittsburgh area. A 
housing fair is planned for August at Pitt 
to deal with various aspects of obtaining 
a house or apartment.
array of air contaminants. These include 
the fumes of metals, plastics, styrofoam, 
ocassionally cyanide, and silica from 
welding and metal-casting, and the dusts 
from stones. Then, on top of all this, many 
students mentioned smelling an ether-like, 
mystery fume. This type of odor does not 
originate in the sculpture area. The 
educated speculators, (including Herb 
Toor and Joe McNally), think that some
one has been dumping organic solvents 
down the wrong drain in either the chemi
stry or chemical engineering labs.
According to sculpture professor Ron 
Bennett, most of the room does have 
adequate ventilators, but they are not 
positioned in the most advantageous 
places. In March 1977, Bennett submitted 
a proposal to Art Department Head Orville 
Winsand and Physical Plant calling for 
an extension of the exhaust system, so that 
it pulls the fumes directly from where they 
originate. Welding and metalcasting are the 
two areas in need of this type of flexible 
extension. The only portion of the 
sculpting room where a new ventilator may 
be needed, added Bennett, is the sanding 
comer; very little air circulates and the 
smaller sawdust particles often remain 
suspended for hours.
Perhaps the most dangerous sculpting 
materials to work with are plastics. 
Bennett reported that he tries to dis
courage the use of them, and has noticed 
that many students forget to follow his 
his instructions for safe handling of the 
plastics when they are used. (One excuse 
is that face masks and gloves are cumber
some.) The truth is, many occupational 
diseases are found among plastics workers; 
sculptors are not immune.
Upstairs from the sculpture room is the 
ceramics area. Winsand said, the claymaking room has been looked at exten
sively, and the plan for improving the 
exhaust is well conceived on paper. This 
project is ready to go, provided the money 
for it is included in the Art Departments 
capital equipment budget for this year.
Chemistry Department Head Robert 
Kay reported no specific problems with 
either the Doherty Hall or Mellon 
Institute labs. The latter, where CMUs 
chemistry research labs are located, has 
a special lab on the ninth floor for the

Herbert Toor, Dean of CIT, announced 
last week that he will leave that post effect
ive in June. Toor had been dean for nine 
years, and he felt that no one should do 
it any longer than that.
Toor first came to the University in 
1953 as an assistant professor in chemical 
engineering. He explained that because of 
cold winters that he and his wife spent in 
London the two previous years, he came 
to find central heating.
Toor will remain with CMU and return 
to his research work in chemical engineer
ing. He received his B.S. at Drexel and his 
M.S. and Ph.D. at Northwestern.
Toor would not speculate on his suc
cessor, but said there was a strong possi
bility that it might be someone within CIT 
now. There is no shortage of administra
tors in CIT. There are a number of good 
engineers here, he asserted.
Some of the programs that came about 
in Toors term have been Engineering and 
Public Policy (E&PP), the Design Research 
Center, the Analysis, Synthesis, and Evalu
ation (ASE) Courses, and the Program in 
Technology and Humanities. Toor believes
that there is a need to humanize engin
eers, to develop interests in music, art, the 
humanities, and other cultural activities as 
well as skills in engineering and science.
Toor said before,Historically, engineers 
have been awfully lousy at recognizing 
problems. Its the humanist who is very 
good at pointing out that we are getting 
into all kinds of new problems. But once 
the problem gets identified it takes the 
people with the technological background 
to get to work on it. So the big challenge 
is to get a man that has got both nf these 
facets. You get a narrow engin who 
says, I have to build a dam thei *\d 
all Im going to do is build a dam,and the 
other guy who says, If you put that dam 
there look at all the horrible things that 
are going to happen. One and the same 
man should have both the technology and 
the understanding, because otherwise you 
just dont know what is going on. The twoculture man.
He thinks that the college is stronger 
now because of the new programs and 
the strong, new faculty that has come to 
CIT in the past nine years. Toor declares, 
Its boom-time for engineers.
Fall Discipline Board Busy
Hundreds of niors met Saturday night to discuss everything from freshman year to this year's 
rise in the graduation fee. The annual Senior banquet was well-attended and the dance in the Skibo 
Ballroom afterwards was jammed. At midnight, sixteen prizes ware given out, including a trip to 
Hawaii for two. The winner of the trip was music m^er Mary Smith. Soma of the senior* who beg
ged the TARTAN to trite their "last photo together" appear above.

There was a reasonable amount of 
disciplinary activity in the Fall semester, 
said Dean jf Student Affairs Earle Swank 
recently in an interview concerning the 
Disciplinary Process for students at CMU.
According to Dean Swank, the Disci
plinary Committee, which consists of one 
University officer or one Academic Dean, 
one member of the faculty, and two stu
dents, actually had more hearings than 
the student court last semester. Swank 
explained that four cases went through the 
routine process of not having to call a 
student court, while two others which did 
go that route were cases where students 
hoped by getting a decision of mitigating 
circumstances to have somewhat reduced 
or lower level penalties. Swank stated: If 
there is a possibility of a suspension or 
expulsion, I feel it (the case) should go in 
front of the full University Committee on 
Discipline. He contends that it would not 
be fair for such important decisions to be 
made by routine procedure, and that they 
should be given high prioroty and full at
tention.
The Disciplinary report completed for 
last semester gave the results on two cases 
of assault, a case of plagarism, one on the 
theft of University licensed priveleges 
(forged food contract card), two cases of 
theft of Universtiy property, one student 
charged for being in an unauthorized area, 
a case of non payment of University 
services, a case on the sale or provision of 
dangerous drugs on University property, 
and one case on compromising the safety 
and security of the Universtiy community.
The parties involved in the two assault 
cases and the compromising of the safety 
and security of the University community 
were found guilty and given suspensions 
with fines or probation or both. After 
appealing those sentences, though, the 
students suspensions were rescinded with 
no other modifications (probations and 
fmes upheld), but were warned that 
further violations of any University 
regulations would result in expulsion. The 
students involved in the University licensed 
privilege theft, plagarism, and sale of pro
vision of dangerous drugs on University

TAIWAN
Flunking-Out
Wise men say that those who flunked out in the past are 
condemned to repeat it. Wiser men (and women), the Deans 
at CMU, throw a year in between the past and the 
repetition of the past. In other words, once a student has 
spent a year (two semesters) flunking out (under 2.0 G.P.A.,
1.75 for freshman), hes asked to take a hike for 12 months. 
Then he can come back to give the academic grind another 
try. If he bombs again, hes given the ax by the University, 
and can not return.
The TARTAN agrees with this policy. A year off gives a 
student a chance to get his or her act together; to find 
direction, motivation and maturity. There are many exam
ples of suspended students returning to CMU and gradu
ating with honors after a years hiatus. The Deans know 
what theyre doing.
But a student who is given walking papers after the 
fall semester is, in a sense, left walking the plank. He cant 
turn around and come back to CMU. He cant get into 
another school on such limited notice. He has to jump into 
the swirling waters of the outside world.
On January 4th, approximately 45 CMU students were 
asked to hit the road for either a year or a lifetime. Many of 
these students figured they could squeeze out a 2.0 in the 
fall semester and survive. Thinking of only the positive, 
they werent prepared for the shock of being thrown out 
of school. Some of them didnt find out until January 6th 
or 7th. School began on the 8th.
Dorm residents who were suspended were given 48 hours 
to dear out of their rooms (some requested, and were 
given more time). Apartment dwellers who didnt want to 
stay in Pittsburgh had to figure out a way to sublet their 
apartments or get out of their leases. And all these students 
had to chart their immediate future.
Students who are suspended at the end of the spring 
semester have things much easier. They have a summer to 
find a job, or get into a community or other college. If they 
want to travel for a year, they have time to make plans or 
change plans. They have a whole summer to realize that 
they wont be going back to CMU in the fall, and theyd 
better find a way to be productive for a year.
The Deans understand the hardships of the Januarydrop,  and they spent a few hours last Thursday morning 
discussing and justifying their approach to such suspensions.
Dean Kail, Associate Dean of CIT/MIS, has the most 
cases of possible-suspensions. In the '78 Fall semester he 
had 150 out of 1800 CIT/MIS students on probation, all of 
whom could be suspended for dropping below the required 
average. He has always tended to suspend or drop more 
students (usually double the number) in May than in Janu
ary for the reasons outlined above. But, even though Pres
ident Cyert has doubts about the January suspension, he 
thinks its necessary.
In some cases where students have been doing so poorly 
academically,  Kail said, it is clearly immoral to take their 
money for another semester. 
While he informs students of their suspension as early 
as possible, Kail finds circumstances prohibit him from 
telling them before grades are issued. To hand pul I 150 
sets of marks for all the students on probation would in
volve thousands of course grades. It wouldn't be feasible 
for the profs or for the department.  Kail said.
In Fine Arts, Dean Midani trys to review significant 
grades before Christmas. But he has a smaller number of 
students in trouble to deal with. Midani also has the 
Deans Student option, where a student who should be 
suspended is in the care of the Dean as he attempts to make 
it in another major.
AH the Deans look at each case on an individual basis, 
and often extend probation to allow students another 
chance.
The Deans know that flunking out is a traumatic time for 
students, heightened when the guillotine is dropped in 
January. Students often feel like they've failed their parents 
who made monetary sacrifices so they could get a good 
education. Students also are embarrassed in front of their 
peers because of their failure.
We try our best to make things easy for them,  Dean 
Midani said, and we're very sympathetic. But just like the 
21 gun salute didn't convince the Shah of Iran that he 
wasn't going to be deposed, students see our bottom line. 
We have to tell them that theyre through. 
Before last Thursday's meeting, theTART AN felt that 
something had to be done about the January drop. After 
hearing the arguments, weve decided the Deans are doing 
a competent job with the problem. We just thought we'd 
let the campus know that the tough situation of mid-year 
suspensions is being handled wisely. Jeffrey Zaslow

Yet Another Slur
Editor:
The other day, while passing 
through Skibo, I saw an adver
tisement posted by the ZBT frat
ernity for a party that they held 
on Friday, January 19. The adver
tisement was extremely offensive 
to Poles and people of Polish an
cestry. I was a bit shocked to see 
an organization on campus public
ly engaging in this sort of vile eth
nic disparagement. It seems as if 
this campus is sinking to even 
lower depths than it did last sem
ester, for at least then the offen
sive acts were committed by 
cowards under cover of anony
mity.
If Dean Swank is as serious as
he claims to be about eliminating 
racism and prejudice on this cam
pus, he should see to it that ZBT 
be suitably punished for this 
slander, perhaps by imposition of 
a fine or suspension of privileges 
It is always important for the 
power of the institution to be of
ficially placed in opposition to 
this sort of ugliness, and this is 
doubly true when such offensive
ness is officially and publicly en
gaged in by an on-campus organi
zation. Such disciplining of ZBT 
might begin to establish Dean 
Swanks sincerity in trying to 
weed out prejudice on this cam
pus, far more than any of the su
perficial palliatives discussed at his 
recent lunch hour forum on dis
crimination on campus.

Price of Elitism 
Editor:
I have recently been struggling 
with a question that I am sure 
every student here has tried to 
come to grips with in the past.
That question is, Is this universi
ty worth the money paid for it?
I am a Civil Engineering stu
dent, so my argument is geared to 
the engineering curriculum.
They call CIT an engineer
ing school yet they teach techno
logy, as its name implies, not en
gineering. To best define my idea 
of what engineering is I will use a 
quote from Excellence in Engi
neering by William H. Roadstrum, a book I would recom
mend to any engineering stu
dent. It says, Engineering is the 
application of technical know
ledge to better meet mans needs. 
It is not technical knowledge. It is 
a doing.  The only steps toward 
meeting this definition in this 
school are the Analysis, Synthesis 
and Evaluation courses and the 
Senior Projects, all the rest merely 
teach technology. Perhaps that is 
why I enjoyed ASE more than 
any course Ive taken here. Even 
then it depends on the teacher 
and how he sets up the course;

David Paul Heddle, a senior physics major, asked for a chance to spout his opinions before he graduates.VIEWS
I am currently a senior Physics 
student. Since it is possible that 
the graduate school I attend next 
year will not be CMU, time may 
be running out for me to write an 
opinionated letter to the TAR
TAN. This is what I am doing 
now. Just for the hell of it.
Nothing could provide a better 
forum for opening my discussion 
than the current controversy 
raging in the TARTAN over racial 
quota systems.
There is an unsigned, untitled 
letter in the January 23 issue 
which begins by making state
ments in the name of the Silent 
Majority. Presumably, this means 
white Americans. Since I am a 
white American, it follows that I 
am a member of the Silent Maj
ority. I would like to express my 
contempt for the author of this 
letter who credits, at least in part, 
some of his statements to me. 
Please speak for yourself.
The writer falls in the ever-pre
sent trap of criticizing racial quota 
systems simply because they dont 
work. (As does the writer of the 
letter titled My Opinion, as 
evidenced by his statement 
affirmative action has gone too 
far...) The crux of the argument 
is that qualified people are left 
unemployed. Thus, neither author 
argues against quota systems per 
se, they argue only that they are 
the means to an unfair end. The 
implication is that if quota sys
tems could be made fair, then 
theyd be okay.
I would argue against all quota 
systems, whether they are fair or 
not, on the premise that they nec
essitate the relaxation of property 
rights, since no longer can an em
ployer have complete control over 
his business.
So, if you believe in quota sys
tems, dont base your beliefs on a 
non-existent constitutional right 
to a job. Instead, have the courage 
to argue that the Constitution is 
faulty and property rights should 
not be as sacred as they have been 
hitherto considered.
If, like myself, you are against
quota systems, dont choose as 
your premise the empirical evi
dence that they are malignant 
rather than benign. Instead, ask 
why we should give the govern
ment another means of control
ling our lives.
I feel we must protect the prop
erty rights of all people, regardless 
of their politics or prejudices. A 
rational employer will hire the 
person who is most qualified. An 
irrational employer may hire only 
ex-convicts. If we begin an at
tempt to control irrationality, we 
are going to need a lot more than 
quota systems.
JP. Stevens is losing control 
over his property because of an 
aroused sympathy for his employ
ees, who feel that Stevens owes 
them a decent living. I still har
bor the secret desire that Stevens 
will some day close down all his 
plants and tell everyone to go to 
hell.
Similar to the arguments en
countered while discussing quota 
systems are those found in discus
sions about the E.R.A. The 
E.R.A. serves as a paradigm for 
progressive legislature which 
under scrutiny turns out to be 
anything but progressive. Argu
ments pro and con for E.R.A. us
ually contain phrases like equal 
pay for equal work or men and 
women really arent equal. Rare
ly does one hear the more funda
mental question asked: By what 
right does the government force 
me to pay women equally?
Discussions of quota systems 
and the E.R.A. consist mainly of 
superficial and emotional reason
ing rather than intellectual reason
ing. Of course, if you argue 
against quota systems or the 
E.R.A. you often times receive a 
raised eyebrow which translates to 
English as You are against 
quotas, therefore, you are a rac
ist or You are against the 
E.R.A., therefore you are a male 
chauvinist pig.
I think that if I were a black or 
a woman beleaguered by discrim
ination I would say, I am an in
dividual. I offer you nothing but 
my competence. If you do not 
pay me what I deserve, I will go 
elsewhere. If you refuse to hire 
me because of some silly preju
dice, and continue to hire incom
petents you will soon go out of 
business, to be replaced by some
one more rational. I am repre
senting no group. I am only me.
If I were black I would not 
consider Martin Luther King a 
hero, for he insisted that the 
world pay attention to the strug
gle of blacks as a group, rather 
than properly pleading for their 
consideration as viable individuals.
However, quota systems and 
the E.R.A. are just two examples 
of the cancerous solidarity fe
ver sweeping over our country. 
Id like to take time to mention a 
few more.
Ralph Nader speaks on my be
half (without my permission) 
when he professes himself to be 
the spokesman of the American 
consumer. Among other things 
that we can thank Nader for is the 
fact that a new automobile has 
about a 50-50 chance of starting 
in the morning if it does start, and 
if you can tolerate the warning 
buzzer that pobably wont go off 
when it should, you had better be 
careful where you park. If you 
park over dry leaves there is a de
cent chance that your catalytic 
converter will start a fire. Nader is 
responsible for many government 
controls of the form: Thou shalt 
not pollute. The private rather 
than governmental solution to the 
same problem would be: You 
had better stop polluting or well 
stop buying your products. Eco
nomic boycott is the proper (and 
most powerful) way to initiate 
business policy changes.
Yes, Nader is a national hero 
while at the same time the man 
who said Let the public be 
damned is considered a criminal, 
or at the very least a prime ex
ample of a capitalistic monster. 
Yet J.P. Morgan and men like him 
(Mellon, Carnegie, etc.) have done 
more for the public good than all
the social workers of the world 
combined, plus 10,000 Ralph 
Naders. (And you can even throw 
in a few Wayne Van Dynes).
Coal miners making $18,000 a 
year go on strike, claiming to be 
the worlds most indispensable hu
mans, and demand sympathy 
from an associate professor of 
Physics earning $16,000 a year. 
Its irrelevant that the professor 
has nine years of college educa
tion and has probably forgotten 
more things than the miner 
knows; it is only important that 
coal miners are guaranteed a de
cent living.
One trucking union goes on 
strike claiming its wages, which 
are comparable to those of an El
ectrical Engineer, are too low. It 
then proceeds to demonstrate its 
commitment to the public good 
by shooting off of bridges with 
high powered rifles. Who should 
you root for, Bill Hills mindless 
idiots (F.A.S.H.) or the rival un
ion (TEAMSTERS) whose prev
ious leaders have been liked to or
ganized crime?
Big business, which is either 
hurt most (railroads ) or helped 
most (telephone companies) by 
government over-regulation is not 
guiltless. The steel industry is look
ing for import quotas rather than 
becoming competitive through 
increased productivity. Who gave 
the government the right to pre
vent me from purchasing foreign 
steel?
More and more the government 
continues its Orwellian squeeze 
into our lives. Today the idea of 
wage and price controls, under the 
guise of Keynesian Economics, 
are discussed without the blink of 
an eye. In fact, if Keynes could 
see the extent of government reg
ulation in peace-time he would 
roll over in his grave.
I would probably receive fewer 
than 10 votes if I ran for presi
dent, but if I was ever elected I 
would, on my first day in office:
1) Abolish the income tax
2) Turn the Postal Service over
to private enterprise
3) Abolish most of the cabinet 
positions and their associat
ed bureaucracies.
4) Abolish all Affirmative Ac
tion plans
5) Remove tariffs
6) Decontrol industry (Includ
ing deregulation of natural gas 
and oil, simplification of li
censing procedures for Nu
clear Power plants, and al
lowing competition among 
utilities)
7) Encourage the construction 
of private schools so that 
public education costs are 
decreased.
This ambitious legislation 
would start us on the road back to 
a rational society.
There is a sick tendency among 
many Americans to label people 
who think as I do as reactionaries 
or anarchists. These people prefer 
the security of a controlled socie
ty. I do not understand this dis
easeit is by far the most perplex
ing concept Ive ever considered. 
It is some form of philosophical 
cancer. I have a hunch, that you 
could catch a glimpse of its nature 
if you could explain why T.V. 
shows like Mork and Mindy or 
Threes Company are among 
the most popular on the air. To 
me, it is incomprehensible that 
anyone would watch these shows 
more than once.
During the war, bumper stick
ers sprouted that read: America, 
love it or leave it. Until this year 
I had been a member of C.M.U.s 
R.O.T.C., which I had mistaken
ly conceived to be a proper way 
of paying for an education. One 
reason that I am glad to be out of 
R.O.T.C. (other than the fact that 
it was a philosophical nightmare 
for an anti-solidarity person like 
myself) is that I could never fight 
for America, for it has no ideals 
left that are worth fighting for. If 
there was any place better, Id 
leave tomorrow. I dont love 
America. I love what it was, and I 
love even more what it could have 
been.more Letters
my ASE II course did not apply 
itself to this definition and I feel 
it was a waste of my time.
' The question is, Why cant
someone attend a  lesser  school 
for less money and achieve the 
same results? These schools 
teach technology just as well as 
CMU, maybe better. Most of 
what I learn here is from my 
textbooks or what the teach
er repeats from the textbooks. 
Very little is taught from the 
teachers experience as an Engi
neer. You might go so far to say 
that a proper reading list with the 
time and drive to study it could 
accomplish the same thing. After 
all, that is how you must keep up 
with technology when you leave 
here, by reading. True, the ASE 
courses may give you an edge in 
the job market but not that big an 
edge and these one or two courses 
are not worth the greater amounts 
of money this school demands. 
I ven ASE can be learned from a 
book. To some extent, the above 
cited book is a perfect example.
All this was on the theoretical 
side. On the practical side I can 
see that employers look to the 
universities for a qualifing of stu
dents in the form of grades and a 
proper curriculum. Again, why 
should this university be able to 
judge students any better than 
other, less expensive ones? Are we 
paying for the name only and the 
connotations it carries into the 
job market? I know a good many
people who, when asked why 
they came here say, in essence, 
that this school has a good name 
or reputation. A good name or 
reputation for what? All schools 
teach technology, and for the 
most part equally well; the only 
place to learn engineering is on 
the job.
This argument applies to all so 
called  elite  schools, not just 
CMU. Perhaps on the graduate 
level these schools show their 
worth but on the undergraduate 
level j I wonder if we are being 
shortchanged. Im asking the 
college community, students and
faculty, am I right, wrong, or am I 
missing something?

Id like to say thanks to the 
Alumni Association for a fantas

Thanks, but why only Us? 
Editor:
A few days ago each of us recieved a copy of the letter below; 
To: Zone D Housekeeping
Employees (Night Turn)
From: J. Brown, Supervisor 
Date: January 10, 1979 
Subject: Letter of Appreciation
On behalf of Director Corletti 
and myself, I would like to extend 
appreciation for your fine work at 
attendance, cooperation, and the 
overall good job you did for the 
University in 1978. I am especial
ly pleased with the special work 
effort during the past several 
months, when it became necessary
for each of you to assist your fel
low employees. I believe each of 
you are responsible for making 
Zone D an effective work unit.
Thanks again for a job weU 
done and may you and your fami
lies have a very good new year.
To say we appreciated it is 
purely an understatement, be
cause we did. However, there are 
other janitors who did not get a 
letter from their supervisor and 
they are curious to know why Jim 
Brown gave us (those janitors who 
work for him in the Zone D area) 
a letter of appreciation  would 
you be so kind as to call Jim 
Brown and ask him why he did 
this?
Respectfully, 
Custodians from 
Zone D Area
Editors Note: The TARTAN 
contacted Mr. Brown after mid
night one evening (during his 
shift) and he told us that his 
motives in writing the letter were 
purely to **praise where praise is 
due.  He said, They help me get
the job done, and I appreciate 
that. Some people look at custo
dians and give them no respect. 
They're not nobodies. They do a 
mighty nice job and I wanted 
them to know I was aware of that. 
I gave the men in my zone letters 
and it would be up to the other 
supervisors to do what they see fit 
in the other areas. I just wanted 
my men to know how I felt.  
Now, My Turn
Editor:
After reading the last few 
rounds of finger-pointing on race 
relations, Im ready to do some of 
my own. One letter asserts that no 
one owes anyone anything. While 
that may by the majority opin
ion, I disagree. I believe genera
tions leave a legacy, a heritage. 
The concept of inheritance is well 
established as it applies to individ
uals. An heir inherits both the 
wealth and debts of an estate. 
This idea is so firmly embodied 
throughout the western world (at 
least) that I must ask why we 
cannot understand the principle as

THE PERFECT SOLUTION

THE FOOD SERVICE COUPON BOOK
Frank Esposito graduated from 
high school in Brooklyn in 1968, 
and went off to the war. He re
turned to depressing job pro
spects, and to a bureaucracy 
seemingly dedicated to denying 
him his tuition assistance bene
fits. He also came back with a 
bad drinking problem and a lot 
of bad memories. His answer has 
been to repress the memories: 
Theres a whole generation, a 
whole chunk of time, thats been 
junked.
Talking with Frank Esposito, 
you begin to understand why the 
entertainment industry has been 
loath to produce movies about 
Vietnam. Those it has produced 
have been presented as love stories 
(<Coming Home), comedy (The 
Boys In Company C), or high ep
ic adventure (Apocalypse Now), 
not as chronicles of war.
It is a war, after all, in which 
many people have a strong stake 
in forgetting. The truth about its 
conduct may tell us things about 
our society and ourselves that 
are not pleasant to ponder. Yet 
it is precisely this evasion of his
tory that opens the war to com
mercial exploitation. And Holly
wood, judging from its recent 
and approaching offerings, has 
finally caught on.
Coming Home and The Boys 
In Company C both did very well 
at the box office. Wholl Stop The 
Rain, the third of eight Vietnam 
movies scheduled for release in
mula, but like the personal focus 
of the film, more a product of the 
mid-70s than the 1960s.
I would have liked to have 
seen the movie much more rooted 
in the Tet Offensive period in 
Vietnam, Fonda said, but we 
couldnt find a way to do it that 
wouldnt come across as laying a 
message on people. When a vet
eran anti-war campaigner like 
Fonda must keep the pivotal 
events of 1968 out of a film about 
1968 for fear of laying a message 
on people, something is up.
In short, the post-Vietnam gen
eration that makes up the lions 
share of any audience leaves these 
pictures seeing nothing of the tre
mendous upheavals in American 
life caused by the war. They dont 
see the smashing of idols, the fall 
of the dollar and American credi
bility, the assassinations and at
tempted assassinations, the riots 
and rebellions in the inner cities 
and college towns, the break
downs in established authority 
and the onrush of repressive rhet
oric and laws.
Instead Vietnam and 1968, 
when the country finally went 
around the bend, emerge as fic
tion, caricatured as individuals 
toying with mental  not political 
or economic  forces. The trend 
reaches its most offensive incarna
tion in The Boys in Company C.
Produced by a huge Hong 
Kong-based conglomerate headed
1978-79, is also holding its own. 
Go Tell the Spartans, with Burt 
Lancaster, has been something of 
a disappointment, grossing less 
than $500,000 in its first seven 
weeks of play. The big Vietnam 
movie, Francis Ford Coppolas 
Apocalypse Now, has yet to ap
pear in theatres.
The story of how Apocalypse 
Now came to be made is emble
matic of Hollywoods collective 
hand-wringing over putting Viet
nam on film. Three years ago, 
United Artists hired Pat Caddell 
and Gerald Rafshoon, two of 
President Carters top public re
lations aids, to find out why 
people go to the movies and what 
their feelings are about the war.
The details of the report are 
secret. But insiders, who describe 
it as a massive intelligence re
port, say that Caddell and Raf
shoon discovered a deep reservoir 
of unease over the lack of any 
official accounting of losses in 
Vietnam. Uneasiness, of course, 
is seldom worth betting $30 
million on, but Coppolas film 
has indeed consumed that much 
money.
With Vietnam Caddell believes 
Coppola is trying to do what he 
did in The Godfather : not to have 
a movie that takes an extreme 
point of view at either end, but 
one thats an experience that 
touches a lot of different levels 
at once.
Its not political, confirms
John Milius, who wrote the origin
al screenplay in 1969. Its an 
adventure story (based on) the 
idea of white civilized men going 
into a place where they suddenly 
have enormous power. The tale 
is notably detached from trou
bling allusions to time and place, 
cause and effect. Though the plot 
is a well-guarded secret, it is 
roughly based on Joseph Conrads 
Heart of Darkness. An early script 
I have seen shows Apocalypse 
Now as a kind of Vietnam-era 
Lawrence of Arabia, hot on the 
sex and death trail.
Hal Ashbys Coming Home, 
though, does take a more politi
cal approach. Its the only Viet
nam picture so far that has por
trayed open resistance to the 
wars demands, which were as 
much a part of the era as the sur
render to violence and disillusion
ment. Yet Coming Home reflects 
the periods tumultuous social 
changes only in individual terms.
Starring Jane Fonda, Bruce 
Dern, and Jon Voight, Coming 
Home turns out to be a cathartic 
love story about Vietnam. Fonda 
is Sally Hyde, an officers lonely 
wife nightingaling at a VA hos
pital. She collides with Luke Mar
tin (Voight) on his rolling stretch
er, smashes his support hardware, 
begs forgiveness. Out of such be
ginnings, only true love conquers. 
Their relationship is patient, re
spectful, restrained by a husband 
(Dern) at war. Its a timeless foris having a trip to

SEE YOU THERE i
Funded by Student Senate
by Raymond Chow (of Kung-Fu 
fame), this Golden Harvest Pro
duction takes five all-American 
boys, standard brand, through in
duction, basic training (where 
pussies turn into men) and on 
into combat, where its all high 
jinks going downhill.
Since only our team is on 
camera, there is a certain loss of 
tension, of truth. We still dont 
know what hit us. In fact, 
a total stranger to history might 
well leave his neighborhood 
theatre possessed of the extra
ordinary idea that the origins 
of the war, the ferocity of its con
duct, the death and mutilation of 
so many, lay in the psyche of the 
American soldier.
For in these movies (and in 
memoirs like Dispatches), this 
is where the war is being dumped. 
Even in Coming Home, Vietnam 
appears as a kind of freefloating 
nightmare from which only the 
fortunate few awaken.
Nowhere in these movies do we 
meet the folks who brought us the 
Great Southeast Asian War, or see 
the reasons for it. Nor do we see 
the enemy, the people whose 
30 year fight for independence 
loomed so large in the minds of 
American policy makers that, to 
extinguish it, they were willing 
to risk their own political sur
vival and the lives of three mil
lion Americans in Vietnam.

applied to a community.
Every man, woman, child in 
this country has inherited from 
past generations. This means that 
we have all, to some degree, 
reaped the benefits (wealth) and 
endured suffering (debt). My dis
comfort is over the distribution of 
the good and the bad. I feel that 
America does owe Blacks some
thing. An analogy: If you were 
held against your will and forced 
to work for someone who paid 
you nothing, you would feel 
wronged. You, of course could 
prosecute your holder for kidnap
ping. You would also seek your 
fair share of the profits he made. 
You might also sue for mental 
stress and punitive damages.
Well, folks, Blacks have not 
asked for punitive damages. We 
have borne that ourselves, as have
many ethnic groups. For the most 
part thats been our share of the 
inheritance. We have inherited the 
slave mentality. ( If youre con
fused, go back to your 85-101 
text Psychology and Life and 
read chapter 9). We have also in
herited poverty and poor educa
tion. I do not imply that no one 
else has, but that most of US 
have.
What affirmative action, pre
ferential treatment, reverse dis
crimination, or whatever you care 
to call it is all about is redistri
buting some of that inheritance to 
the heirs of people who rightfully 
deserve some of it. What of immi
grants who arrived after slavery? 
They were lead here because 
American business needed labor. 
Thus, they earned their piece of 
the pie. Do they owe deprived Americans anything? Yes. Yes!
Would there have been jobs for 
them to come to had not all the 
contributors (slaves among them) 
contributed. By coming to this 
country, your ancestors inherited 
(or tried to inherit) a full share of 
our heritage, legacy, and estate.
Exercise: Compute the present 
value of approximately 250 years 
of slave labor (not paid for) and 
approximately 100 years of labor 
at wage rates of 15-70% lower 
than the average wage rate. 
Express this sum as a percentage 
of the net worth of America. We 
didnt file any criminal charges 
either.

Editor:
I have now been at CMU for 
over three years. Over those years 
I have frolicked in many a snow
storm but even though these 
storms tend to be great for stu
dent morale they tend to create 
very dangerous conditions for 
walking around this campus.
In particular I mean the priori
ty system for cleaning off the 
campus sidewalks after a blizzard. 
It appears that every time it 
snows the first place you see the 
greenmen of Tech is cleaning off 
the stairs and patio surrounding 
Warner Hall. It is nice to know 
that they dont want anything to 
happen to President Cyert, but do 
they have to clean all four sets of 
steps? Isnt one enough? While the 
greenmen are busy cleaning off 
Warner Hall, students are carefully 
negotiating their way through 
snowdrifts trying to make it to 
classes without breaking their 
necks on any one of the many 
campus stairways that have low
priority but high usage.
But to make the situation even 
worse, areas of campus housing 
appear to have the lowest priority 
for snow removal. Few of the 
sidewalks are ever cleaned and 
many of the stairways in the 
dormitory and fraternity areas are 
totally ignored. Trudging to 
classes through one-foot-deep
slush, I have become accustomed 
to but I find stairways like sliding 
boards to be outright dangerous.

jobs requiring more specialized training.
The purpose of this program is to afford 
the student an opportunity to get into real 
living contact with the people and customs 
of Europe. In this way, a concrete effort 
can be made to learn something of the cul
ture of Europe. In return for his or her 
work, the student will receive his or her 
room and board, plus a wage. However, 
students should keep in mind that they will 
be working on the European economy and 
wages will naturally be scaled accordingly. 
The working conditions (hours, safety, reg
ulations, legal protection, work permits) 
will be strictly controlled by the labor min
istries of the countries involved.
In most cases, the employers have re
quested especially for American students. 
Hence, they are particuarly interested in the 
student and want to make the work as in
teresting as possible.
They are all informed of the intent of 
the program, and will help the student all 
they can in deriving the most from his trip 
to Europe.

Eight Groups Forget 
Budgets
by Scott Sibley
Senate is now making preparations for 
budgeting for next year. Allocations re
quested by the various organizations are 
printed elsewhere in this issue of the TAR
TAN.
On Sunday, February 4 at 4:00 PM, the 
Senate Finance Committee will hold an 
open forum for students to voice their 
opinions on the requested subsidies. 
Budget hearings will begin on Wednesday 
February 7.
There are eight clubs that have not sub
mitted budgets at this time. Mary Ann 
Lawton, Finance Chairperson, reports that 
these clubs have not been scheduled for 
budget hearings and will not be given any 
sort of priority in the budgetary process.
Senate now has approximately $30,000 
in unallocated funds from this year. The 
possibility of including this money in the 
budget process is being investigated.
The General Campus & Information 
Committee is investigating the possiblity 
of a campus lounge area. Anyone with 
ideas or suggestions should contact Carl 
Freedman.
The Academic Affairs Committee is 
working with Ruth Corrigan, Director of 
University Libraries, on improvements 
for the library system. Currently, plans for 
creating a casual reading area in Hunt Li
brary are being reviewed. According to 
Eric Anderson, Corrigan fees that stu
dents dont know how to use the library 
and what we have. This is a significant 
cause of the feeling that our libraries are 
inadequate. She requests that students ask 
for assistance when they cant find some
thing.
The next Senate meeting is tonight at 
7:00 PM in the Wherrett Room.

property were found guilty and fined 
accordingly, with the latter two parties 
being placed on probation for specified 
periods of time.
In the remaining four cases, the students 
charged entered pleas of guilty and paid 
the fines for their particular offenses.
The CMU Student Handbook states that 
The University attempts to guarantee due 
process in all disciplinary procedures. 
Consequently, students charged with viola
tion of University regulations must be 
afforded a prompt hearing, notified in 
writing of the specific violation (charged 
with), and given full notification of com
plaints, hearings and disposition of 
charges with the right to be present 
through all hearing procedures. Students 
charged also have the right to have other 
students, faculty members, or legal counsel 
appear at any hearing. Other student rights 
include the rights to remain silent through
out the disciplinary process, and the rights 
to confidential proceedings.
The Handbook also outlines the 
Jurisdiction process, stating the Univer
sity Committee on Discipline will rule on 
all appeals from action originating in 
student courts and will have original 
jurisdiction over infractions of academic 
regulations.

Architects Featured in Scaife Show
by Stuart Seidman
After four weeks of very hard work, the 
student show by the Department of Archi
tecture will be opening this Thursday at 
the Scaife Gallery of the Museum of Art, 
Carnegie Institute. The show will be of
ficially opened Thursday evening at 5:00 
with a cocktail party. A long list of Pitts
burgh executives and civic leaders have 
been invited to the opening and Mayor 
Caliguiri of Pittsburgh will be present to 
offically cut the ribbon to the Entrance 
Gallery.
In conjunction with the shows opening 
this week, two people who have projects in 
the show will be appearing on WTAEs^lM 
Pittsburgh on Thursday morning. Briar
Tomlinson, a masters student and Paul 
Ostergard, a 1977 graduate, will be appear
ing on the TV show to discuss their pro
jects. Briar was recently involved with de
signing a facility for the Heinz Hall Plaza 
site on Liberty Avenue. In the spring of 
1977 Paul worked on a design for a hotel 
to be across the street from the new Con
vention Center. The city just purchased the 
site the students used and is currently 
looking for a developer to build a hotel.
There has recently been an increasing 
level of dissension within the students of 
the department to how the faculty has 
handled the show. When the show was first 
announced last December, student enIK PRIZES

thusiasm was high. However, as work began 
on preparing the 28 projects to be presen
ted, conflicts began to arise between 
work for the show and academics. The 
way it was organized was poor and it didnt 
do what it could have, one student com

The students dissension to the show is
coming on top of another failure in the 
search for a permanent head for the archi

recommendations for a new head by Jan
uary but that deadline has passed. The De

Art Supplies Cause Health Hazards
by Elliot Ohlberg
The following is largely based on the 
Health Hazards Manual for Artists, by Dr. 
Michael McCann.
Are the materials you are working with 
slowly killing you? Or maybe they are just 
going to make you chronically ill?
It seems that many artists create, with 
little regard for the health hazards inherent 
in the technology of their craft. In fact, 
many toxicologists (professionals who 
study the biochemistry of poisons) believe 
that chronic poisoning is more common 
among artists than is generally believed. Of 
course, this is not unique to artists, since 
more and more so-called safe substances 
are found not to be so safe. One problem 
is that diseases which result from long
term exposure are hard to diagnose be
cause the symptoms are vague and dont 
appear at the time of exposure. The 
immediate, acute-type of poisoning is more 
easily recognized.
Toxins can gain entry into the body via 
skin contact, breathing, or through the 
mouth and digestive system. Skin contact 
is the most frequent method, but it is the 
breathing of vapors and dusts which more 
often leads to harm of internal organs. 
For example, the welding fumes which 
result from overheating many plastics 
can immediately damage the lungs. On the 
other hand, inhalation of the dusts pro
duced from sanding wood and plastic 
sculptures, or silica dusts from clay and 
some stones, can cause chronic lung dis
eases such as pulmonary fibrosis, chronic 
bronchitis, or emphysema.
It is also true that cigarette smokers
are considerably susceptible to the de
leterious effects of poisons on the lungs.
The extent of damage to the body 
caused by toxic materials depends on the 
amount one is exposed to, length of 
exposure, and the actual toxicity of the 
substance involved. Artists should choose 
their materials with care since some pro
ducts are much less toxic than others.
In general, solvents are one of the most 
underrated hazards in art. They are used 
to: dissolve and mix oils, resins, varnishes, 
and inks; remove paint, varnish, and lac
quers; and clean tools, silkscreens, brushes, 
and hands.
Aromatic hydrocarbons, like benzene, 
are among the most dangerous solvents, ff 
drunk or inhaled in sufficient amounts, 
these can cause irreversible blood damage. 
Initial symptoms include weakness, fat
igue, palpitations, pale complexion, and 
anemia. If used with adequate ventilation, 
toluene is a suggested replacement for 
benzene since it is less toxic.
Aerosol sprays are widely used by ar
tists. Again, the fumes are very dangerous 
if inhaled. The fine mists often travel long 
distances before settling. In addition, the
propellants used in aerosol cans are often 
hazardous, in themselves.
The fumes from etching metals with ni
tric acid are very dangerous and result in 
fluid in the lungs at best. This is a tech
nique commonly used by intaglio students 
in CMUs Coal Research Building.
In Ceramics, it is important to avoid 
breathing in silica dust when handling 
clay in its dry form. The symptoms of
silicosis may take years to develop and in
clude shortage of breath and increased 
susceptibility to infections. Serious poison
ing can also result from breathing glazes 
which contain highly toxic metals like 
lead, antimony, chromium, maganese, 
nickel, and others.
There are all kinds of dangerous air 
contaminants released in the various 
sculpting techniques. Besides silica, sculp
tors must also be wary of wood dust, 
metallic fumes from welding, carbon monoxide from incomplete combustion of 
fuels, and the toxic gases released upon 
burning styrofoam or plastics.
The minimization of health risks can be
come a popular craze among artists. The 
best way to reduce a hazard is to find a less 
toxic substitute, if that is possible. And, as 
the Manual says, One of the most impor
tant factors in designing a studio  and one 
of the most neglected  is adequate ven
tilation.Sexuality Lecture Arousing
 A  n  1 j _ J ______ \ M___ _______11-----------  ---- --- w x r ham /ta ii/Mir v i inliftrby Susan Borg
On Thursday January 25, Pam Wiess, 
from the CMU Counseling Center, spoke 
on the Psychological Development of 
Sexual Systems. This was the second in a 
series of human sexuality lectures spon
sored by Residence Life and Campus 
Programming.
Ms. Weiss began before birth and traced 
the emergence of sexual identity through 
adulthood. She spoke about the effects of 
hormones and environment on the 
formation of ones sexual activities (not 
only in intercourse, but actual role be
havior) was a main part of her discussion, 
and she sited studies that showed evidence 
in both directions.
Weiss went on to say that our sexual 
identity controls our behavior on all levels. 
It determines how we relate to other 
people in all situations. If one feels locked 
into a sexual identity that is not com
fortable (i.e.- an artistic man in a construc
tion job because he was taught that men 
are not supposed to be sensitive artists) 
they do not usually discuss it. Many 
people, says Weiss, feel that if they to en
gage in an activity that is not traditionally 
for their sex, they must choose a gay life
style. There is nothing wrong with being 
gay, she clarified, but you should not 
feel you must be gay because you are in 
a non-traditional role.
Ms. Weiss then went on to talk about 
sexual identity in each sex. She said that 
developing a sexual identity has not been 
done equally in our society. Men have 
been made more attractive. An example 
of this is in childrens books. Men are 
almost always the hero while the woman 
stays behind. This, she says, is currently 
changing.
Another difference in sexual identity 
in men and women stems from attitudes
about our bodies. Men usually are more 
familiar with their sexual organs for the 
obvious reason that they are constantly 
seen, whereas the female genital area is 
hidden and therefore, more of a mystery.
Attitudes about our body come from 
very young childhood. A lot depends on 
whether you were allowed to touch your 
body as a child. Another important factor 
is how your parents handled your sexuality-i.e. did they tell you about the changes 
you were going through at puberty? The 
attitudes of your parents have a great 
bearing on how you will feel about your
body and hence, your sexuality.
Masturbation, said the counselor, is the 
best way to get to know your body. It 
alleviates tension while allowing you to 
explore. Masturbation can be a big help in 
gaining satisfaction from a sexual relation
ship because, says Weiss, if you know what 
feels good you can guide someone else.
In summary, Pam Weiss stressed that it 
is the caring and richness in a relationship 
that makes it special. If you are not com
fortable with your own sexuality you will 
not be able to fully give of yourself and 
accept all that a relationship has to offer.
TIDBITS
At the start of this semester, a consider
able number of texts were not available at 
the Bookstore. Even at this time, some 
books for this semester have not arrived.
In a recent statement, Irene Daugherty, 
Director of Campus Stores, apologized for 
the inconvenience and tried to account for 
the delay. Some of the factors that 
contributed to the problem were:
1) An increase of volume activity at the 
end of the Fall semester. This prevented 
removal of Fall tests and the restocking of 
Spring texts.
2) The shortened work period between 
semesters. Deliveries were significantly 
reduced between December 27 and 
January 2.
3) Late orders and inaccurate/insuf
ficient information in ordering. Publishers 
shipping errors and out of stock situations
also caused delays.
Daugherty explained some steps the 
Bookstore plans to take next year to 
prevent a recurrence of the delays. Next 
Fall, unsold books that wont be needed in 
the Spring will be removed from shelves by 
December 1. Book orders for the 1980 
Spring semester will be due October 2. 
Also, the store will be closed from 
December 22 to January 1 for restocking.
If anyone forsees a problem with these 
changes, please contact Daugherty at the 
Bookstore.
The Computation Center is offering the 
following free seminars for the spring sem
ester.
All classes will be held between 11:30

For a few of us in Pittsburgh last week, 
Super Bowl Sunday wasnt so super. Al
though it may be difficult to imagine, an 
element exists in this city that was not 
rooting for the Steelers in the big game. 
That element with a few exceptions is 
not overly conspicuous but they remain 
loyal Dallas Cowboys fans and they would 
probably present a good argument for 
calling Dallas the best football team in 
the NFL. Although my membership has 
caused me a great deal of trouble through
out my stint in this city, I must admit that 
I am an integral part of this element. 
While I respect the Steelers as an out
standing football team, I have been a loyal 
fan of the Dallas Cowboys for over twelve 
years. Being from New York where I 
should have logically chosen the Jets or
n ssbsss  mmmmmmm  : s. s?
Dallas Fan Succumbs to Reality
Giants as my team, I have no idea why 1 
picked Dallas as the forum for my football 
support. Twelve years ago the cheerleaders 
had not yet surfaced and Dallas hadnt 
even been to a Super Bowl. Maybe it was 
those helmets with the fancy star in the 
middle that attracted me. Whatever the 
reason, while everyone else growing up 
around me wanted to grow up to be Joe 
Namath and lead the Jets, my dream was 
to be Dandy Don Merideth, the starting 
quarterback of the Dallas Cowboys. As 
you might have guessed, I have yet to 
realize this dream. Roger Stauback is get
ting old though, so who knows what will 
happen in a couple of years.
Ive often asked myself why Americans 
get so damned excited about football. 
It is basically a very primitive game. As 
one critic of the game suggests: After
you take away the cheerleaders, the fancy 
uniforms, the television cameras, the fancy 
play books and strategy, what you really 
have is 22 grown-up men knocking each 
others brains out. Our society has gone as 
far as convincing every male in America 
that he is unmasculine if he doesnt sit in 
front of the television set every Sunday, 
drinking beer and watching a good 'old 
fashioned football game. Although the 
previous critic has a point, I must take 
argument with him. While I wont pretend 
to deny that football is somewhat primi
tive, it serves a very definite need for our 
often overly tense society. Football is one 
of the greatest escapes existing in American 
society. Although it has emerged into a 
fantastically successful business, the NFL 
provides good clean relaxation for millions 
of Americans every week. The Super Bowl
If you missed it last week 
You can still buy a

Desk.
attracted 100 million viewers because in 
this world of uncertainty and instability, 
last week one thing was certain. Every 
American who turned on the Super Bowl 
knew that he would get at the very least a 
good couple of hours of entertainment. We 
could turn on the game and know that no 
one would get killed and that both a win
ner and loser would emerge at the conclu
sion.
As I must term myself an American 
football fanatic, Super Bowl Sunday 
should have been the climax I had waited 
for all season. On the contrary though, 
it a a grave disappointment. I was so 
thoroughly convinced that Dallas would 
defeat the Steelers that I mouthed off the 
week before like the vibrant Thomas 
Henderson himself. Because my heart 
more often than not dictates my mind I 
lost in excess of $40 as a result of the 
Pittsburgh victory. Sitting in a room of 
Iron City beer drinkers (who were deter
mined time and again to show me where 
they live) and devout Steeler fans, I barely 
enjoyed the game. In fact, since the game, 
I wake up every night in a cold sweat 
seeing Jackie Smith drop the ball that 
half of the people in America could have 
caught.
Although it is so difficult to remain a 
fan of the opposing team in this town,
I will continue. I enjoy football and theres 
no team for me other than the Dallas 
Cowboys. You have the right to love the 
Steelers for they are the legitimate World 
Champions of football and you should 
never give up that right. As for me, Ill 
forgive Roger Stauback, Randy White and 
yes, even Jackie Smith for losing Super 
Bowl XIII. Although were not World 
Champions this year, at least we tried 
harder. You cant ask anything more than 
that.

All American Girl Sought After
by Mory Brenner
For years young women have sat in 
front of their television sets either admiring 
or scoffing at the contestants of the Miss 
America or Miss Universe beauty pagents. 
Some respond with envy for the girls, and a 
wish that they too might someday become 
a beauty queen. For others it is a sexist dis
play of the female anatomy, based solely 
on a womens smile and bustline (not to 
mention how she looks together with all 
her other parts in a bathing suit). This year 
the ABC television network is sponsoring 
a pageant which is attempting to look for 
more in a girl then just her outward ap
pearance.
The All American Girl competition will 
judge its contestants in five categories: Ap
pearance, athletic ability, disco dancing, 
fashion coordination, and personality (in 
alphabetical order). In the first round of
competition, only appearance and athletic 
ability will be taken into consideration. A 
girl may compete in any one of the fol
lowing nine sports: Baton-twirling, diving, 
figure ice skating, figure roller-skating, 
gymnastics, skate boarding, sychronized 
swimming, tennis or water-skiing. The win
ners in the preliminary Pittsburgh judging 
will go on to compete against the winners 
from the other 23 cities participating in the 
ABC contest.
This summer the national finals will 
take place in California. Each girl will be 
flown out, all expenses paid, so that she 
may take part in the last segment of the 
evaluation. At that time the All American 
Girl will be selected, awarded $25,000 and 
a guest appearance on an ABC prime tim 
television show. The last of these competi
tions will be filmed and made into a special

Did you ever hear the one about Frank Buck?
Frank Buck was the greatest animal trapper 
that ever lived. He trapped animals for zoos, for 
circuses, for sideshows, for almost anything. Dur
ing his long career he made quite a name for him
self as the greatest animal trapper that ever lived.
One day, like many men, Frank Buck reached 
the age of sixty-five and decided to retire. So, out 
hero bought himself a little farm in Louisville, 
Kentucky and settled down to live out his remain
ing years in the peaceful surroundings of rural 
Louisville.

Diego Zoo. We realize you've led a long and busy 
life, and you deserve a peaceful retirement as 
much as any man on earth, but there's this one 
unusual animal we need, and you're the only man 
we know that can get it for us. It's a hornless rhi
nocerous."
Well, Frank Buck (being in retirement and all 
that) naturally argued a little, but finally consent
ed to get this hornless rhinocerous for the San Di
ego Zoo. So, the next day he went down to his 
boat on the shore (this was before the days of air
planes), sailed across choppy seas, and landed in 
Africa, where he went a'hackin' and a'choppin', 
and a'choppin' and a'hackin' through the jungles 
of Africa till he met Tarzan.
Now Tarzan was painting stripes. However, you 
couldn't tell if they were white stripes on a black 
zebra, black stripes on a white zebra, or black and 
white stripes on a clear zebra. So Frank Buck 
went up to Tarzan and said, 'Tarzan, I hate to 
bother you while you're so busy, but there's this 
one unusual animal I need. Would you happen to 
know the whereabouts of a hornless rhinocer
ous?"
Now Tarzan, being so busy and all that, natur
ally was a little upset. But he put down his brush, 
pointed to a bush, and said, "UGH!" And lo and 
behold, out walked this hornless rhinocerous!
So, Frank Buck captured the hornless rhino
cerous, thanked Tarzan (who had, by this time, 
gone back to painting the zebra), and went 
a'hackin' and a'choppin' and a'choppin' and 
a'hackin' back through the jungles of Africa, back 
down to his boat on the shore (this was before 
the days of airplanes), sailed back across choppy 
seas, and landed in America. The next day, he de
livered the hornless rhinocerous to the San Diego 
Zoo, and went back into retirement on his little 
farm in Louisville, Kentucky.
Well, three days later Frank Buck was sitting 
out on his back porch when the phone rang. This 
time it was the Chicago Zoo. The zookeepers at 
the Chicago Zoo said, "Mr. Buck? This is the Chi
cago Zoo. We hate to bother you, seeing as you're 
in retirement and all that, but there's this one un
usual animal we need and only you can get it for 
us. It's a short-necked giraffe."
Weil, Frank Buck (being in retirement and all 
that) naturally argued a little, but finally consent
ed to get this short-necked giraffe for the Chicago 
Zoo. So the next day, he went down to his boat 
on the shore (this was before the days of air
planes), sailed across choppy seas, and landed in 
Africa, where he went a'hackin' and a'choppin' 
and a'choppin' and a'hackin' through the jungles 
of Africa till he met Tarzan.
Now, Tarzan was painting stripes. However, 
you couldn't tell whether they were black stripes 
on a white zebra, white stripes on a black zebra, 
or black and white stripes on a clear zebra. So, 
Frank Buck went up to Tarzan and said, 'Tarzan, 
I hate to bother you while you're so busy,but 
there's this one unusual animal I need. Would you 
happen to know the whereabouts of a short-neck
ed giraffe?"
Now Tarzan (being so busy and all that) natur
ally was a bit peeved, but he put down his brush, 
pointed to a bush, and said, "UGH!" And lo and 
behold, out walked this short necked giraffe.
So Frank Buck captured the short-necked gir
affe, thanked Tarzan (who had, by this time, gone 
back to painting stripes), and went a'hackin' and 
a'choppin', and a'choppin' and a'hackin' back 
through the jungles of Africa, down to his boat on 
the shore (this was before the days of airplanes), 
sailed across choppy seas, and landed in America. 
The next day, he delivered the short-necked gir
affe to the Chicago Zoo and went back to retire
ment on his little farm in Louisville, Kentucky.
Well, three days later, he was sitting out on the 
back porch when the phone rang. This time it was 
the Smithsonian Zoo. The zookeepers said, "Mr. 
Buck, we realize you're in retirement and all that, 
but there's this one unusual animal we need, and 
only you can get it for us. It's a trunkless ele
phant"
Well, Frank Buck (being in retirement and all 
that) naturally argued a little, but finally con
sented to get this trunkless elephant for the 
Smithsonian Zoo. So the next day, he went down 
to his boat on the shore (This was before the days 
of airplanes), sailed across choppy seas, and went 
a'hackin' and a'choppin', and a'choppin' and 
a'hackin' through the jungles of Africa till he met 
Tarzan.
Now Tarzan was painting stripes. However, you 
couldn't tell if they were black stripes on a white 
zebra, or white stripes on a black zebra, or black 
and white stripes on a clear zebra. So Frank Buck 
went up to Tarzan and said, 'Tarzan, I hate to 
bother you while you're so busy, but there's this 
one unusual animal I need. Would you happen to 
know the whereabouts of a trunkless elephant?"
Now Tarzan, totally peeved, broke his brush 
over his knee, threw the brush into the bushes, 
pointed to a bush and hollered, "UGH!" And, lo 
and behold, out walked this trunkless elephant.
So Frank Buck captured the trunkless ele
phant, thanked Tarzan (who had by this time 
picked up a chipmunk and was painting with its 
tail), went a'hackin' and a'choppin', and a'chopin' and a'hackin' back through the jungles of Af
rica down to his boat on the shore (this was be
fore the days of airplanes), sailed across choppy 
seas, and landed in America. The next day, he de
livered the trunkless elephant to the Smithsonian 
Zoo, and went back into retirement on his little 
farm in Louisville, Kentucky.
Three days later, he was sitting on his back 
porch when the phone rang. However, this time it 
was a wrong, number. So the next day, Frank 
Buck has his phone disconnected and lived hap
pily ever after.

'Tim who?"
Banks. He's the guy over by the bar talking to
Al."
"The one who looks like a stork?"
"Yeah, that's him."
"Freshman?"
"Very. But he's pretty cool, I guess. I've parti
ed with him before."
"With him? He looks like a refugee from a 
Perry Como concert. I haven't seen pants that 
short since..."
"Hey, give him a break; he's new here. He's try
ing to change, but it might take a little while. He 
had a strict childhood. Overbearing mother, I 
think."
"Oh, yeah. The old 'castrating bitch' syn
drome."
"I didn't know you were a psych major, Dale."
"I'm not I just made that up. Say, what's your 
interest in this guy?"
"I don't know. I guess I feel sorry for him. I 
was like that myself once, you know."
"You're kidding!"
"Sad, isn't it? Do you realize how many people 
in this world have never gotten stoned?"
"It's frightening. You know, Nick, I think de
cent, pot-smoking citizens like ourselves should 
do somehing about the situation."
"Definitely. Hey, Tim," he called.
Tim luuked up "Yeah?"
"C'mere. I got someone I want you to meet 
Tim, this is Dale Tevelt, the world jack-off cham
pion."
"Ah, fuck you," said Dale.
"You'd never go back to women," replied 
Nick.
Tim laughed. This is it, he thought Meet peo
ple, make a few connections.
"Nice to meet you/' he said.
"Yeah, same here," said Dale. "Nick's been 
telling me a lot about you."
"Okay," said Nick, "so much for polite conver
sation. Let's go get stoned."
Tim's eyes grew wide behind his coke-bottle 
lenses.
"How about you, Tim?" asked Dale. "You feel 
like getting a little fucked up?"
"Sure." His grin was beginning to cover the 
lower half of his face.
"Well, finish your beer and get another one," 
said Dale, "then we'll go."
Although he had hardly touched his beer, Tim 
gamely gulped down the rest of it. His throat 
started to tingle and his eyes watered, but he kept 
up a good front. "Let's go," he said.
The September air felt invigorating after the 
cramped mustiness of the fraternity basement. As 
the sweat on his forehead began to cool, Tim felt 
better than he had at any time within memory. 
Nothing in the past even seemed real anymore. He 
thought of the people he had known back home. 
He hadn't really known anyone, had he? He start
ed to hum a few bars of "If They Could See Me 
Now," and broke up laughing.
"Hey, what's so funny, men?" asked Dale.
"What isn't?" laughed Tim.
"That's the spirit!" cried Nick.
"Are you sure you're not stoned already?" 
Dale asked.
Tim smiled broadly. "Not yet."
Dale had to laugh in spite of himself. Naive as
hell, he thought, but he's got potential. God 
knows, this college could use some fresh blood.
"Hey, Dale," Nick said, "you got your key?"
"Man, where the hell would you be without 
me, Royce?" said Dale. "I'll tell you where. Up 
shit creek, that's where." He flung open the door 
with a dramatic flair. "Home at last!" he cried, 
flinging himself on the bed. "Hey Nick, roll a 
joint"
"Why don't you?"
"Because you're closer. Hey, Tim, take a seat"
'Thanks." Tim plopped into a beanbag chair 
and waited anticipatorily.
"I always have to roll," said Nick. "Why don't 
you ever roll?"
"Don't get bitchy. You want to roll it, Tim?"
"I'm not . . . very good at it," Tim admitted.
"No sweat," said Dale. "Nick will show you."
Nick threw a pillow at Dale that he managed to 
duck.
"Come on, Tim," he said. "You'll learn some
thing."
Tim watched with open-faced attentiveness as 
Nick brought out the pot, papers, and rolling 
machine.
"Now this little device here," he said, indicat
ing the machine, "makes things a lot easier. Not 
only that, it comes in six decorator colors. I'll bet 
you never saw anything like this back home."
"You can say that again," Tim replied. He 
couldn't think of anything better to say, but 
hoped that that was good enough. He had never 
seen anything like the machine before, and he 
marveled at its ingenious simplicity.
"With one of these," Nick was saying, "any
body can become an expert roller in no time at 
all. Maybe it's not art, but you can't have every
thing."
He rolled as he spoke. "Some people prefer 
smoking pipes or bongs. Not me. A joint's a lot 
more efficient. There's no waste. It's also easier to 
pass around. You don't have to worry about spil
ling pot or bong water on the floor. And it's also 
easier to hide, just... in . .. case."
He grinned knowingly and produced the finish
ed joint
"Ta-da! /srt'fthat amazing?"
"Fascinating," said Dale. "Fire it up."
"Would you like to do the honors, Tim?" ask
ed Nick.
"Sure," Tim replied. He had been mentally tak
ing notes through out the entire process. He did 
not want to forget anything.
The match lit on the first strike.
Good, he thought, Now take a good hit, but 
don't cough this time. If these guys start thinking 
you're a 'pussy,' you're through.
A sweet stinging filled his throat and began to
filter down to his lungs. He felt an almost over
whelming desire to cough.
Don't let go, he thought, whatever you do, 
don't let go. Remember what Nick taught you.
With an effort he didn't know he had in him, 
Tim suppressed his cough and held it all in his 
lungs. He blew out an admirable cloud of smoke.
You did it, he said to himself. A hit to be 
proud of. Just like you've been smoking for years.
The rest of the night became one long, confus
ed party. More people began to drift in, following 
the aroma with uncanny accuracy. Introductions 
were made, but Tim didn't remember any of the 
names for more than a few minutes. All names 
and faces seemed to merge into one.
He had been determined to have a good time, 
and he was pleased to see his wishes come true for 
once. He had no idea how much he had smoked
when he leaned back and said:
"I think I'm stoned."
"So who isn't?" came a voice from the haze.
"Well, I've smoked before," he replied, "but 
I've never reallygotten high. I don't know what 
I'm supposed to feel like."
"What do you feel like?" asked Nick. *
Tim replied slowly and deliberately, as though 
making an effort.
"I'm very aware of my tongue," he said, "but I 
couldn't tell you where my feet are. The room 
seems to be a lot longer. I can't remember my 
Social Security Number. But I don't care. I feel 
like going back to high school and lighting up a 
joint in the middle of class. A joint rolled in a 
page from my Physics II textbook."
"I'd say he's stoned," said another voice.
"That's a distinct possibility," said a third.
"One way to check for sure," said a voice that 
Tim was fairly sure belonged to Dale. "Do you 
have any profound revelations?"
"Any what?"
"Profound revelations," said Nick. "You know, 
something with deep meaning that you couldn't 
possibly think of if you were straight."
Tim thought for a second. "What this country 
needs," he said, "is a good fifteen-dollar ounce."
The room exploded in gales of stoned laugh
ter. As talk circulated about running Tim for pres
ident on the platform of a good fifteen-dollar 
ounce, he leaned back and closed his eyes.
Not bad, he thought. You've finally got 'peer 
approval.' Isn't this how you'd like to spend the 
rest of your life?
Someone far in the distance was warning him 
that this was exactly what he should be trying to 
avoid, but without any support or encourage
ment, the voice slowly became enveloped in the 
haze.
Someone passed him a joint.

He came upon the cobblestones, so slow 
He almost paused in mid-step, letting me 
Trace the lines of the face I now know 
As well as my own. Faintly I could see 
The way his gaze was held in ecstasy 
By something keeping just beyond his sight 
Fading music on a pine-scented breeze, 
Mirrored in eyes duskily fringed in night 
These were the things that created the pride 
That kept him always moving on, alone,
His outline merging in the waning light 
With the form of the broken cobblestones.
I much prefer memory's haze; I hear 
The edges of reality too clear.

Your image whirls in my withered mind. 
The scraping of bamboo brush 
Raking interminable the eternal procession of 
foliage,
Keeping my grounds antiseptically spotless.
Hands, inky extensions of broom.
Dark sleek skin, mistaken proof of 
Large-hearted beneficence.
Tresses that shamed branches 
That mercilessly shed leaves.
And the excruciatingly ephemeral grin,
Muffled on arising within folds of transparent 
sari.
Momentary coquettishness
Amidst a history of submission, hidden emotion,
Reproduced exploitation.
You expired yesterday, Savitri,
At childbirth. Relinquished life,
Had not food enough to nurture 
Another creature, sacrificed both.
Why was there no scream of 
Need, want in my ears?
Scraps off my plate would've diverted 
From canine, feline amusement.
Kept you standing atop rich earth 
And your own,
New generation of subservience 
To white invaders and brown mimics.
Savitri, how could we communicate,
Was there ever chasm profound 
As two shrivelled souls?
The legacy of hunger,
And the arrogance of birth.

'Cause I see you now in a different light,
Your eyes don't sparkle, and your smile ain't 
bright
And your silk smooth touch is like a sow's ear 
now,
And the honey of your lips has gone stale.
The day, finally, it has come 
When you no longer are the sun 
That shines both night and day.
Your frail facade, your carapace
Is shattered now, like so much glass 
Revealing thus for me to see 
That which you ne'er seemed to be.
'Cause after the wine and the roses and the tears, 
And after all I've said and done and tried for you, 
I fear
Is faded, to a whisper, though still it is near.
I cannot, as you did, feel hate, or feel spite 
But I do see you now, in a different light.
That the wine is now envinagered,
And the roses are but thorns,
And your sweet salt tears are but bitter brine 
I will no longer mourn!
The flame has died, the embers out,
The memories all grown wan.
And all the love that I once held dear

How would you like to write fora publication 
with real impact? Although we certainly encour
age everyone to continue submitting to FOLIO, 
the Admissions Office is interested in getting stu
dent input for their booklet, Reflections. Reflec
tions is mailed out to students who have been ad
mitted to CMU but who have not decided wheth
er or not to enroll.
Debbie Mall, Assistant Director of Admissions, 
wants to know some of the thoughts you have as 
you reflect on your education and experiences at 
Carnegie-Mellon. Although humor is appreciated 
if it is sincere, the Admissions Office would like 
to know how you seriously feel about what
you've gone through or will go through here. 
They're interested in the bad and the good, the 
academic and the social aspects, the benefits and 
the disadvantages, the joys and disappointments... 
Any way you wish to express it, Reflections 
would like to know what CMU is to you.
Here are some samples from last year's edition.
"I think the university is here to serve the stu
dents. I think it is here to provide an institute of 
higher education where we can feel that we are 
getting an education that we can put to good use 
after we get out. I think it is about learning to 
cope with life. I figure that if you can cope with 
some of the pressures...some of the problems... 
some of the things at CMU... you won't have too 
many problems once you graduate/'D.D.
Because of academic pressures here I think it 
is necessary for you to find yourself...be comfort
able with yourself...develop your interests. Here, 
there is no norm, no stereotype, so you don't 
have to conform."N.F.
"I have never been in a class where people have 
said, 'No, I can't help you because it will hurt the 
average.' It is always, 'We really want to see one 
another get along well and get our grades up.' 
There is no cutthroat attitude. It's always that 
your friends are there and they are your friends

An Important Announcement Aimed At All 
Extroverts
Concerning introverts (with reservations):
We aren't all bad, you know.
We don't discover continents, but 
we do quieter things, less ostentatious claims to 
fame
like inventing pizza and electric knives 
and even running the New York Met 
(opera, not baseball), 
leaving You People to toss piecrusts, and 
carve potroasts (en daube, bien sur), and 
shriek arias.
Loud and bawdy is not for us;
we direct the spotlight from the wings, without
ever (desiring a chance at) stepping
into its wavering bounds.

ENTERTAINMENT
Playwrights Series uses rock 'n' roll as thematic basis for plays
by Karen Locitzer
Recently, rocknrolls been a concert of 
theatrics as well as music. Wild makeup 
glitter clothes and violence on stage suc
cessfully express the vitality of the music 
to the audience who often responds with 
dancing and cheering. Hugh Esten and 
Robert McGrath feel that theatre lacks this 
communication of energy and the two 
plays they present, opening tonight in the 
second production of the Playwrights Se
ries, pour rocknroll into the audience to 
fill them with the life of the music.
This kind of theatre shouldnt be look
ed at the same way as a Tennesee Williams 
play. Theres no tension, or development 
of character. . . Cowboy Mouth is a classic 
in a theatre movement that is fighting against making theatre a series of outlines, 
McGrath informs me. He is humorously im
patient with outlining this philosophy. He 
looks at Cowboy Mouth, a rocknroll dra
ma written by Sam Shepard and Patti 
Smith as a . . kind of conjuring ses
sion. . evoking the fantasies and reali
ties of a relationship in the rocknroll 
culture.
Hugh Esten, writer and director of 
Bobby Angel (actually written backwards) 
says that while the audience can and 
should deal with his play intellectually, he 
wants it first to hit them physically and 
emotionally. Exploring the life and eventu
al breakdown of someone from his home
town now in jail, Esten feels that rock n 
roll expresses the violence his character 
feels toward a world which is backwards 
and incomprehensible. Its Bobby Angel 
and rocknroll against the alphabet and 
western society. He continues, If I 
could have gunfights and car chases on this 
stage, the music wouldnt be necessary.
Producer John Wells chose these two 
plays because Esten and McGrath are ar
tists whos work he respects and whom he 
personally trusts. The purpose of the 
Young Playwrights Series is to give student 
playwrights and directors the badly needed 
chance to see their works performed. Be
lieving that these student professionals 
need the kind of feedback only full scale 
productions can provide, he set out last fall 
to convince the drama department of this. 
Walter Eysselinck, head of drama, was re
ceptive because he was aware that the play
wrights in CMUs program werent seen 
enough and that there wasnt enough
theatre space on campus. Hes given the 
Series free run on CMU costumes and 
props. Theyve always been more than 
helpful says Wells.
But it is Wells, writing requests and 
checks for copyrights on plays, reading and 
selecting scripts, finangling for theatre 
space and paying the operating costs, who 
has sole responsibility for the Young Play
wrights Series. He fronts the money for the 
productions and asks a dollar donation at 
the door. At the premier production of the 
Series last December, audience turnout 
reached 400, and he just about broke even.
Its not something Im doing to put on 
a resume,  he says, and I wouldnt have a 
longer run because the performers (stu
dents at CMU, alumni and faculty) are 
overworked as it is. He has an impressive 
enough list of credentials anyway, working 
at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival and LaMamas E.T.C. before coming to CamegieMellon to take a graduate degree in pro
duction and directing.
While he realises that the Series needs an 
audience  if not for the money, at least 
for morale - he isnt willing to sacrifice his 
unique productions for an audience dedi
cated to a particular kind of theatre. His
ideals demand that he offers plays that are 
completely different, as diverse and indi
vidual as the directors and playwrights 
themselves. His only guideline is that each 
production feature a new play written by 
a CMU student and an established play 
interpreted in a new way by a student 
director.
The worst thing that could happen is 
that no one comes. After all the hard work 
everyone does, thats terrible, he worries, 
hoping that his audience will grow through 
word of mouth. The Young Playwrights 
Series will have to build its reputation 
only on the promise of new and exciting 
theatre. In a Series as varied as this one will 
be, theres bound to be something for 
everyone sooner or later.
Bobby Angel and Cowboy Mouth are 
showing tonight and tomorrow night at 
the Theatre Express Building, 4615 Baum 
Blvd. There is a special performance of the 
two plays scheduled for 11:30 PM Wednes
day night. The third and fourth produc
tions of the Series will be in mid-March and 
late April For more information, call578-

'Assassins' utilizes craft of CMU alumni
by Dan Livak
Assassination is a topic which has arous
ed the American publics interest for a 
number of years. Books, plays and movies 
written about the assassination of Ameri
can presidents have profited their authors 
especially well in recent times; Mark Lane 
can attest to it. Charles Gilbert, Jr., a CMU 
alumnus, has added a new work to this 
field, Assassins, a musical drama which is 
presently being preformed at Theatre Ex
press. One may wonder if a musical is the 
proper vehicle for a play about assassina
tion  I certainly did  but Gilbert has 
managed to make Assassins work well as a 
musical. The score paces the mood of the 
play perfectly and although in several of 
the numbers the lyrics of the songs are lost 
in the singers mouths, the vocal abilities of 
the company are generally quite good. 
Catherine (Casey) Roberts, currently 
attending CMU, puts forth an especially 
strong performance in her various roles; her 
voice is clear and empathic, her presence 
on stage commands attention.
Gilbert and Roberts are not the only 
Theratre Express personages to have come 
from CMU. William Turner, the director of 
the play, also graduated from CMU, as did 
the Technical Director, Norman Russell, 
and Susan Cash, the companys leading fe
male performer. Cash seems at home on 
stage, and her quasi-comical role is well 
suited for her hyper-expressive face. At one 
point in the play Cash turns to a cardboard 
computer and addresses it as a demi-god; 
it is through Cashs pseudo-scientific 
ter that Gilbert most directly reflects the 
influence that CMU has had upon his writ
ing.
The play centers on the silent Fat Man, 
impeccably played by Frank Serrao. The 
fat Man is a mystical character responsible 
for setting up various Presidential assassins; 
Squeady Fromme, John Wilkes Booth, 
Sirhan Sirhan, Sara Jane Moore and others 
all make their appearances to state their 
cases. Gilbert ingeniously has limited the 
speeches of the historical characters in the 
play to words which they had authored 
themselves.
A collage of bibliographic scenes pre
sents the background of the assassins, 
which helps to establish the plays con
gruency. Time then advances to 1981, and 
the Fat Man is trying to find an assassin 
for a Jimmy Carter look-alike. Meanwhile, 
a government agency, headed by Cash, is 
attempting to determine the next presiden
tial assassin by analyzing the data available 
concerning all previous assassins. Naturally 
both the Fat Man and Cash converge on 
the same man.

Marley good introduction to music
by Ted Smits
Many musicians have tried to relate 
their music to current social or political 
problems especially during the sixties. 
Many of the rock n roll bands were lead
ers or strong supporters of the protest 
movement. Most of todays popular music 
is not so politically oriented, but there is 
one exception. Bob Marley and the Wailers 
are not only the number one reggae group 
in the world but may also be the most 
powerful political force in Jamaica. Bob 
Marley has just released a live album, 
Babylon by Bus, which should give him 
more exposure to American listeners and 
introduce reggae music to an even greater 
number of people.
Eleven years ago Bob Marley converted 
to Rastafarianism, a Jamaican cult which 
recognizes the late Ethiopian emperor, 
Haile Selassie as the personification of God 
and views smoking ganja (marijuana) as a 
religious experience. The Rastamen are 
wary of capitalism and white men and 
hope that their God will lead them to the 
promised land in Africa, leaving the white 
men in their Babylon. The Rastafarian cult 
is very opposed to the rule of Prime Minis
ter Michael Manley and may soon be re
sponsible for toppling his government. The 
Rastafarians have good reasons to be angry. 
The Prime Minister has taken no steps to 
ease the problems of poverty and racism
that cause the extreme frustration with life 
and politics that is often expressed in Marleys songs. It is this frustration which has 
led most of the Rastamen to escape from 
their problems by smoking ganja and listen
ing to reggae music.
The album is a great piece of work. 
Never before has Marley been able to show 
the emotion and power of the music. The 
opening song, Positive Vibrations, is pre
ceded by a stunning invocation to Haile 
Selassie which ^ demonstrates the way in 
which the reggae music is inseparably join
ed to the Rastafarian cult. The songs are 
very enjoyable to listen to and have a much 
more optimistic feeling then -some of his 
earlier work like Natty Dread. The two 
main topics of Marleys songs are political 
revolt and the joys of smoking ganja.Rebel 
Music, War, and Stir it Up are some of the 
best songs on the album. Lively Up Your
self has an excellent guitar solo that shows 
Marleys musical talents. Concrete Jungle 
may be a big hit in the United States just 
because it has a more rock n roll sound 
than the others. Listening to this album, it 
is hard to feel uninvolved in the political 
turmoil of Jamaica. While his songs no 
longer seem to be based in anger and hat
red, there is no denying the political ideas 
behind the songs.
Marley performs with his regular Wailers 
but has also added a group of three female 
vocalists, one of whom he is married to. If
Steve Forbert is on his way
by Lisa Klepper and Beth Schottenfeld
Im glad to be so young,
Talking with my tongue,
Glad to be so careless in my way.
And play against the odds,
Im glad to be so crazy in my day.
Steve Forbert,GoinDown to Laurel"
Steve Forbert definitely played against 
the odds when he went to New York City 
from Mississippi with his guitar and 
harmonica three years ago. This move has 
certainly payed off for him and for us. His 
first album A live on Arrival is an impressive 
debut. Forbert began by playing anywhere 
he could in New York, which often meant 
the streets and even in Grand Central Stat
ion. Some of these experiences are reflect
ed in his song Grand Central Station, 
March 18,1977.
Forberts style is a mixture of folk, rock 
and blues woven into pleasant tunes with 
penetrating lyrics. But by far the most 
distinctive quality in Steve Forberts 
music is his voice. His husky, raspy, tenor, 
that has often been compared to Rod 
Stewarts, is the key factor that brings
Man is a god clothed in rags, a master of the universe 
going about begging a crust of bread. He is a king 
prostrated before his own servants, a prisoner walled 
by his own ignorance. He could be free . . . He has 
only to walk out of his self-constructed prison, for none 
holds him there but himself

Bob Marley expresses his political and social convictions in song.
you have never heard reggae music before 
it may be a shock to hear Marleys songs. 
The beats to most of the songs are very sim
ilar and they may be hard to distinguish 
from one another until you are used to 
them. The only real fault of the album is 
that it does get a little monotonous and 
Marleys lyrics cannot often be heard clear
ly. The album is still one of the best releas
ed in 1978 and a good introduction to reg
gae music.
The album was recorded during his Eur
opean tour this past summer. Bob Marley 
has infrequently played in America and has 
played even less in Jamaica. About a year 
ago government soldiers raided Marleys 
house and he received some gunshot 
wounds. Since that time he has not been
living in Jamaica. He did come back once 
to play at a large outdoor concert even 
though there was a threat against his life. It 
is a rare situation in which a musicians life 
may be in danger just because of his politi
cal views, but Marley is not afraid. The lyr
ics to one of his best songs, Rat Race, il
lustrate this fact.
Political violence fill your city,
Dont involve Rasta in your city. 
Rasta dont work for no CIA.
When you think its peace and safe, 
A sudden destruction.

You got the horse race,
You got the dog race,
You got the human race,
But this is the Rat race.
the songs across. He has been called the 
new Dylan because of his folk style 
and frequent use of a harmonica which 
he wears around his neck like Dylan. 
However, Steve Forbert is definitely a 
performer in his own right. This is evident 
whenever you listen to his album or see 
him perform.
Many of the songs on Alive on Arrival 
relate Forberts experiences, and what hes 
learned about life since going to New York. 
In It Isnt Gonna Be That Way Forbert 
sings about learning to change your plans 
when dreams crumble. Steve Fortberts 
Midsummer Nights Toast and Big City 
Cat call to mind vivid images of a strug
gling musician in the big city. And in 
Tonight I Feel So Far Away From Home 
we see that this struggle isnt easy and 
Forbert often missed Mississippi. He has let 
the audience into his life and the songs 
truly have that from the heart feeling.
Forbert is playing at the Decade in 
Oakland tonight. This is a good 
opportunity to see a promising, talented 
performer on his way to the top. After all, 
Springsteen and Dylan started in clubs too.
Out there in the Atlantic Ocean on a sunshine beach 
theres going to be an outbreak of revelry this vacation 
break. And after the sun goes down... well, you know the 
effect that moonlight has on a celebration. We can only 
hope it wont be a full moon.
Because from Jan. 13 through April 21 were opening

Beyond that, youre invited to improvise. And since your

CalvinKlein to bring style to Pittsburgh
by Joan Livitski
Artis a word that encompasses a va
riety of terms. Things are artistic, artfully 
done, arty, and works of art. The Womans 
Committee of the Museum of Art at Carne
gie Institute along with the help of Kaufmanns and some very artistic people, 
have planned an artfully done fund-raiser 
thats Pure Posh. No, Im not just trying 
to be arty. The program is called Pure 
Posh which is sure to prove itself a work 
of art.
The extravaganza will consist of a fash
ion show featuring one of the foremost 
designers of our time, Calvin Klein. Follow
ing this peek at the new spring/summer 
line, those in attendance will be served 
wine and cheese. Rounding out the festi
vities will be dancing to the music of 
Peter Duchin and his orchestra.
Pure Posh will be held February 14 at 8 
PM in the Carnegie Music Hall. Its purpose 
is to raise money for purchasing additional 
works of art for the museum.
The Womans Committees goal is to 
promote the arts, education and communi
ty involvement. In their attempts to do this 
they have become instrumental in sponsor
ing the conception of the Three Rivers Arts 
Festival and the development of the Man 
and Ideas lecture series. Other promotional 
and instructive endeavors are their biennial 
antique auction and their slide presentation 
which describes the museum and its collec
tions.
Whatever the event, the Womans Com
mittee always seems to manage to give it an 
aesthetic appeal. Pure Posh looks to be no 
exception to the rule, and part of the 
reason for this is due to the choice of Cal
vin Klein as guest designer.
Calvin Klein is indisputably recognized 
as an artist in his field. Not only is he the 
youngest American designer to have been
elected to the Fashion Hall of Fame, but a 
recent Newsweek cover article credited his 
collection as being instrumental in the 
coming of age of American fashion. In as 
much as he helped the American fashion 
industry grow, Calvin Klein has broadened 
his own career as well. A three time receipient of the coveted Coty Award, Calvin 
Klein attributes his success to his total in
volvement with todays American woman. 
I do what I love to do. I design clothes for 
women with identities. He offers the ba
sics, but leaves enough freedom for the in
dividual to come through.
Calvin Klein, who studied at the Fash
ion Institute of Technology, says of his 
work, I enjoy designing for a woman 
who is a collector. We all have our special 
things. . . I hope that my designs are the 
kind of clothes that a woman wants to 
mix and keep from year to year.
One of the first high fashion designers 
to introduce a full sportswear line, Calvin 
Klein developed his reputation around 
clothes with clean and uncontrived lines. 
He has taken easy, casual sportwear and 
given it soft elegance, impeccable cut, 
luxurious fabric and unique color. He saw 
the need for this type of clothing because 
the American life style had changed. . . . 
Their lives have changed and there is little 
time for wardrobe planning..
The American woman may have little 
time for plans, but Calvin Klein is full of 
them. Along with his already established 
areas of design in mens and womens 
wear, accessories, and linens, he has 
launched his own cosmetic, fragrance and 
skin care firm, Calvin Klein Cosmetics, Inc. 
He soon hopes to extend his design con
cepts even further into a line of home furn
ishings by lending the same taste level evi
dent in his garments to the American 
home.
Pictured are examples of the simple but elegant sportswear fashions that established 
Klein's reputation as a designer.

Departments merge talents for 'West Side'
A joint production by CMUs Drama and 
Music Departments of West Side Story will 
open at the Kresge Theatre on February 8.
CMUs annual musical will run for a lim
ited engagement of eleven performances 
through February 17. Tickets are $4 and 
$5.50 and are available through the College 
of Fine Arts Box Office, 578-2407.
West Side Story, originally produced on 
Broadway in 1957 and later made into a 
film, is a powerful tale of two hostile teen
age gangs fighting for supremacy amidst 
the tenement houses, corner stores, and 
bridges of the west side of New York. De
liberately given the shape of Romeo and 
Juliet, West Side Story finds bits of beauty 
in a wasteland of discontent, creatively 
capturing the shrill beat of life in the 
streets.
The CMU production will highlight the 
talents of five juniors in leading roles, all 
members of the inaugural class in the uni
versitys musical theatre program. Two of 
the leads, Brent Barrett (Tony) and Carol
Burt (Maria), appeared with Pittsburghs 
Civic Light Opera last summer.
West Side Story director Gregory 
Lehane describes the show as one of the 
most successful efforts to integrate song, 
dance, and book in a musical. Lehane and 
choreographer Myron Howard Nadel are 
working together with the cast to help 
them blend acting, song, and dance into 
seamless characterizations to the 
musicals jazz motif. Robert Page is musical 
director for the show, as he was for the 
previous CMU musical, productions: 
Follies, Kiss Me Kate, and Carousel.
Evening performances of the musical are 
set for February 8-10, and 12-17, at 8:20 
PM. There will also be two Saturday mat
inees, February 10 and 17, at 2 PM. Tic
ket prices are $4 for the matinees and Mon
day through Thursday performances; $5.50 
for Friday and Saturday evenings. Ticket 
information and reservations are available 
at the CMU Box Office (578-2407)
Area artists urged to participate in Arts Festival
The Three Rivers Arts Festival cele
brates its 20th year with a change of dates. 
The Festival will open on June 8, and run 
through June 17,12 noon to 10 PM daily.
Traditionally, this nationally known fes
tival of the arts has opened on Memorial 
Day weekend. This year, 1979, at the re
quest of Pittsburghs Mayor Richard Caliguiri, the dates have been changed to coin
cide with the National Mayors Conference 
being held in Pittsburgh.
The Festivals newly-appointed Execu
tive Director, John Jay, emphasized the im
portance of having area artists participate 
in this 20th annual event.
We urge all artists 18 years and over fr
om Western Pennsylvania and surrounding
areas to enter the Festival this year. Not 
only will you help us mark the close of our 
second decade, but it will be an opportun
ity for your work to be seen by Mayors 
and their aides from all across the coun
try.
Once again, paintings, prints, drawings, 
sculpture, photography and crafts will be 
juried by slides.
Entry forms are now ready and waiting. 
Send your return address and two firstclass stamps to the Three Rivers Arts Fes-' 
tival, 4400 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, 
Pa. 15213.
The deadline for returning completed 
forms and slides to the Festival is March 
30,1979.
A panel of seven jurors, all prominent
regional artists, will judge the slide entries. 
The jurors are J. Robert Bruya, of Grove 
City, Pa., Jerry Caplan, Marie Kelly, Irene 
Pasinski, Mark Perrott, Louise Pierucci and 
Frank Webb, all of Pittsburgh.
Regional artists will have the choice of 
entering the Juried Visual Arts Show for all 
10 days of the Festival or the Artists Mar
ket area where space is rented for five-day 
periods, and artists must be on the scene to 
handle their own sales.
Some artists may choose to enter both 
shows. The single entry form covers both.
Cash Awards totalling $3000 will be 
given at the discretion of the jurors, and 
Purchase Awards will be made by area 
corporations.
In addition to the visual arts exhibits, 
the Festival offers continuing performances 
of music, dance, theatre, as well as films, 
childrens activities, on-going art demon
strations and workshops, and always a 
special or two, such as sky sculpture. . . 
all for free.
Carnegie Institute sponsors the out
door Festival which annually draws an es
timated crowd of 200,000 local and outof-town visitors.
Set in the heart of Pittsburghs down
town business complex, Gateway Center, 
the Festival grounds are courtesy of the 
Equitable Life Assurance Society of the 
United States.
Campus Program Planning and the Department of Residence 
Life present an eight-part Human Sexuality Program. All 
programs will be held in the Wherrett Room, Skibo, at 8:00

Hollywood hears the Who
(CPS)-- Therere rockers all over the 
world, insists Bill Curbishly, manager of 
the British rock band, the Who. The rock
ers, says Curbishly, are what will insure 
the success of the Whos upcoming movie 
Quadrophenia, which is based on their 
1973 album of the same name.
Although album sales were, at a mere 
three million copies, disappointing, 
Curbishly said, the movie is expected to 
rival the success of the the Whos first 
movie Tommy. That movie, 
of course, was based on the rock opera writen by Who guitarist, Peter Townsend, and 
starred lead singer Roger Daltry.
While rumors circulate that Who memb
ers are getting tired of making music, they 
dont appear to be tired of making movies. 
After Quadrophenia, the Who plans a 
science fiction movie based on their
IIIIIIIIIIIIII
album Whos Next.
Roger Daltry also plans another screen 
appearance in a movie version of the book 
McVicar, in which he plays a contemporary 
English robber who stages a sensational 
breakout from a maximum security prison. 
(The real-life con is now a parolee studying 
for a masters degree at Sheffield Universi
ty in England.)
Currently, though, the filming oiQuad
rophenia is about to be wrapped up, re
ports Curbishly, whos also co-producer. 
Public exhibition will start next summer, 
after a debut at the Cannes Film Festival.
Quadrophenia, incidentally, is a noun 
meaning an advanced state of 
schizophrenia. The movie, according to 
. press reports, will portray the violent 
mod-rocker youth conflicts of mid-sixties 
England.

Tartans lead PAC after win over Bethany
Swim team defeated by JC
point spread until the Bisons cut the lead 
to 75-72 with 40 seconds remaining in the 
game. Ten seconds later the Tartans were 
only up by two points and the game seem
ed in jeopardy. However, Hufnagel and 
Belechak converted on 6 straight foul shots 
to preserve the victory.
DeFilippo served out 10 assists, just one 
less than the entire Bethany team total. His 
sharp passing set up good shot selection by 
the Tartans as they shot 64% from the field 
compared to 40% for Bethany. Belechak 
led the team in rebounding with 7 and was 
second in total points with 21. He helped 
pick up the scoring and rebounding ability 
of Dave Huffmeister who was lost when he 
fouled out of the game with 8 minutes re
in ainingon the clock.
The Tartans will face Washington and
Jefferson tomorrow at 8:00 PM at W&J 
and attempt to stay atop the PAC.
Women's BB undefeated
ther good race in the 100 free with a time 
of 51.79, but lost the event by less than 
one second. Tom Barr and Todd Reinke 
finished third and fifth in the stiffest com
petition this year.
Coach of the Tartans, Donna Pecman, 
inspired her swimmers to go out there and 
do your best times. Joe Dickey easily won 
the 200 back, followed by Dave Watterson 
and Mike Hurley. Jim Matysek tried one 
of the most difficult feats in swimming. He 
paced to an easy victory in the 500 free, 
leading the entire race. Tom Gerlowski and 
Janet Axtell also swam the event. Then Jim 
got back on the same block to swim the 
200 breaststroke. His exhaustion was evi
dent. The strategy to sweep the two events 
failed, but Jim still placed second. Brian 
Hobbs and Jamie Uber placed fourth and 
fifth. In required diving Bob Frye and 
Debbie Cohen placed third and fifth. The 
400 free relay was stacked with the best 
sprinters, Tom Barr, Todd Reinke, Joe 
Dickey, and Nick Watts. They annihilated 
the John Carroll relay by more than 
half the pool.
It was an exciting meet although the 
results were not as expected. The team 
went into the meet with an optimistic atti
tude, but look forward to seeing the Blue 
Streaks again in March when the Tartans 
have reached their peak. Next Saturday

Forward Larry Hufnagel hit for 32 
points and guards Maranno DeFilippo and 
Joe Belechak combined for 41 more to 
lead CMU past Bethany 82-76 on the Tar
tans home floor last Wednesday night. 
The win kept CMU on top of the PAC with 
a 5-0 slate while Bethany dropped to 3-2.
Carnegie-Mellon was ahead throughout 
the first half, with their biggest lead of 8 
points coming with 1 minutes to play. 
However, they couldnt break the game 
open and found themselves holding only a 
three point half time lead over the Bisons, 
35-32.
In the second half, DeFilippo sunk 2 of 
his 20 points with 16 minutes remaining to 
ignite 8 unanswered points by the Tartans 
giving them a 49-38 lead. CMU then bat

The CMU Womens basketball team is undeafeted in the month of January. They 
have won five games in a row since January 
14. The current winning streak has seen 
victories over Point Park, Thiel, Seton Hill, 
Bethany and Chatham. On January 17, the 
Tartans won the opening game of a 
doubleheader against Thiel. The game re
mained close until the end of the second 
half when C.M.U. jumped out to a 10 point 
lead. The final score was C.M.U. 61, Thiel 
52. The following Saturday, the Tartans 
destroyed Seton Hill 7141. Kassie 
Segmiller was high scorer with 18 points 
even though she sat out much of the 
second half because of foul trouble. Last 
Wednesday night Bethany gave the Tar
tans a difficult time during regulation but 
some clutch shooting in the final minut by 
Terry Preskar pushed the game into over
time. C.M.U. eventually won 50-45. 
Scoring in double figures for C.M.U. t 
were Kassie Segmiller with 15 points,
Terry Preskar with 14 points and Shari 
Burton with 11 points. Shari hit the 
boards for 23 rebounds. Chatham College 
was the Tartans next victim. They found 
the going very difficult when they tipped 
off against the Tartans last Friday night. 
Kassie Segmiller scored more points that 
the entire Chatham offense combined. She 
poured in 37 points to bring her season 
average to 23.4 points per game. The final 
score was C.M.U. 77,Chatham 35. Scoring 
in double figures for the Tartans were Shari 
Burton with 12 points and Carolyn Baxter

This past Saturday, the CMU Swim 
Team travelled to Cleveland to the Blue 
Streaks of John Carroll, second place fin
ishers in last years PAC championship. Al
though the Tartans lost 65-48, many of the 
races were close. The Tartans managed to 
stay untouched in five events.
The meet began in the usual fashion 
with the Tartans (Dave Watterson, Jim 
Matysek, Harry Coleman, and Tom Barr) 
winning the medley relay. With only one 
entry in the 1000 free Wilson Boyce took a 
third place. In the first of the close races 
freshman fish Nicholas Watts was barely 
out-touched in the 200 free. Tom Gerlow
ski also swam a good race and broke the 
2:00 minute barrier for the first time this 
year. Maureen Fernandez swam her per
sonal best time in the 200 free. Todd 
Reinke, senior Jeff Bland, and Janet Axtell 
also did well in the 50 free. Co-Captains 
Joe Dickey and Harry Coleman failed at a 
last attempt to overcome the Blue Streak 
swimmer, but both turned in their best 
times this season for the 200 IM. Patti 
Miller also swam in this event for the first 
time this season.
In the required diving Bobby Frye, 
Brian Kay and Debbie Cohen placed 3, 5,

CMU Hockey team wins
The Tartan Ice^ociiey 'Feam recently be
gan its second half of the 1978-1979 sea
son with a 10-2 victory over Boyce Cam
pus. This was their first game since Decem
ber 10, 1978, when the Tartans struggled 
to a 4-4 tie with Duquesne University.
In the game against Boyce Campus, the 
revived pucksters didnt waste any time 
getting onto the scoreboard. Rick Smith 
fired home the first goal with an assist 
from Mark Jonatti. The game settled down 
for seven minutes, until both teams ex
changed goals. Rick Weeks scored for CMU 
with passes from Tom Grimmich and Mark 
Licata. Boyce answered with a goal only a 
few seconds later. However, Boyces goal 
is what seemed to spark the Tartans into 
a six-goal scoring splurge over the first two 
periods. Chaves scored an unassisted goal.
Grimmich and Weeks.
The second period opened with a score by 
Jeff Reh with a pass from Rick Smith. Two 
minutes later, Tom Grimmich scored, with 
an assist from Don McDade. CMUs power 
play unit put it together midway through 
the second period, with a tally from Mark 
Jonatti assisted by Jeff Reh and Frank Car
ter. Grimmich then scored his second goal, 
with an assist by McDade. Boyce capped 
the second period with a futile score.
Jonatti opened the final period by scor
ing, with a pass from Carter. Most of the 
third was filled with penalties and some 
hard checking. The final goal was scored by 
Carter who took a neatly placed pass from 
Grimmich. The Tartans will attempt to re
main unbeaten with a game at Lakevue,

Many university students want to become involved in a campus 
organization, but find that it is hard to discern what the different groups 
are and what they do. For the student who is interested in playing a part 
in planning and organizing a major segment of the campus' en
tertainment, Activities Board may be the answer.
Activities Board is a student-run, organization, funded by the ac
tivities fee, that plan dances, movies, coffeehouses, concerts, lectures, 
special events, and other events that the board feels the students would 
enjoy. The Activities Board, commonly referred to as the A.B. offers the 
students a chance to choose activities for the campus and organize those 
which they feel will reach a large portion of the campus community.
A.B. is interested in students who have ideas and the desire to par
ticipate in programming events at CMU. Below are listed the various com
mittees of the Activities Board with their functions, goals, and objectives. 
We are currently planning this semesters' events, however all com
mittees welcome new members at any time during the year. On Wed
nesday, January 31st at 6:30pm in the Wherrett Room, Skibo, we are 
having an Open House with all A.B. committees represented. Join us on 
the 31 st; We would love to have you join A.B.
