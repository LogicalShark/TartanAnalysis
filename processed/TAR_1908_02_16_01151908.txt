Mr. Walter C. Kerr, of the cele
brated engineering firm of Westinghonse, Church, Kerr & Co., visited the 
schools last Thursday and addressed 
the day students in the General As
sembly room. He was introduced by 
Dr. Hamersehlag, who commented 
upon the schools fortune in being 
able to listen to a man of such broad 
experience and prestige in the world 
of engineering, and gave it as his 
wish that the men would make it a 
lesson hour.
Mr. Kerr said in part:
Mr. Hamersehlag, gentlemen and 
boys, I am glad to see you. It gives 
me a great deal of pleasure to come 
to an institution of this kind and see 
what is being done. I often feel that 
some of us rush through a very busy 
life with a great deal to do all the 
timeit is a great relief sometimes 
to have a chance just to stop a min
ute when one goes into this world of 
great activity; you will all go out into 
it very soon and will be rushing 
along the same as the rest of us. Like 
the Irishman that fell off a high 
bridge,as he went down he clutched 
a fellow workman and they went down 
together. On the way down one fel
low turned to the other and said: 
Mike, do you suppose the Lord is 
with us? and Mike said, Well, I 
dont know, but if he is he is going 
some. That is about the way we
are all going some, and it is a very 
busy time, and we don't often take 
time to stop and think, unless we get 
arrestedyou know you can get ar
rested for other things besides steal
ing. . I got arrested by your Director 
and he said I would have to come 
here as a penalty and say something. 
That is a pleasure, not a penalty. I 
just like to stop and talk to some 
young men who are educating them
selves. I got a lot yesterday, I saw a 
spirit abroad here,a spirit that is 
right in line with what the world of 
engineering construction wants,
We are all apt to think of the world 
and the things about us just as we 
see them now, and it is not easy to 
go back and think of how they were 
and it is not very easy to think of 
how they are going to be, but you can 
get a little light on things by going 
back a little way-about fifty years, 
or by going back about as long ago 
as when I was born, and I hope you 
dont think I am an old man yet.
There was a time, quite some time 
ago,long before any of you were 
bornbut not so long ago either 
when the engineering and constructive 
part of the world was very different 
from what it is now. There were 
two divisionsthe engineer and the 
artisan. The engineer, notably in 
England, which was at that time the 
leading country of the world in such

matters, conditions having been 
changed since by the advance of Ger 
many and this country, and others 
the engineer was an office man, and 
conspicuous among other things, he 
never did anything and only thought 
out things and told other people whar 
they ought to do. He designed things 
sometimes he designed them so 
they could be built and sometimes so 
they could not be built; and away at 
the other extreme was the artisan who 
bad been taught by his father and his 
grandfather that his business was to 
work and not to inspire. Now that 
day has changed, it changed for a 
very good cause; it changed becaus2 
the artisan found he could do more 
than simply work; he found he could 
also think; it changed because the 
man who sat on the high pinnacle 
was found wanting and some went so 
far as to trust the artisan rather than 
the engineer, so that it came to the 
time when a lot of people began to 
think that there was not so much dif
ference between theory and practice, 
and that reversed it entirely. No 
more about the history of that story.
There came a time when we began 
to think that the way to work a man 
was to work him in the field and in 
the office; in fact, some of the best 
engineering concerns to-day have 
their men do everything; they work 
as draftsmen, they work as designers, 
they go down and work with the en
gineers on the dynamos and every
thing. With that came another big 
development. There was a time in 
this older age I speak of when this 
man who sat up in the office was 
afraid he would get dirty. He was
not looked upon as much of an oracle 
if he went around looking kind of 
dirty and the artisan on the other 
hand did not mind being dirty all the 
time, but pretty soon this wore off 
because of these changes that I speak 
of, and it came to be recognized that 
it did not make any difference whether 
you were dirty or not, and the more 
that the men put their hands to work 
the less differentiation they made be
tween work and thought; and now we 
believe that there is not anything like 
dirtof course there are unsanitary 
conditions and all that, but there is 
not any such thing as dirt because it 
is a part of the worlds work, and 
now with this sort of effort the old 
distinctions past out. Construction 
and design though, and labor go hand 
in hand and the big mian is the man 
who can begin at the beginning and 
go all the way along and work all the 
way through. 
******* 
There is a great deal of talk in the 
world about intellectual processes and 
again about handicraft and work on 
the principle that intellect is one 
thing and handicraft is another. In a 
long discourse which I would not un
dertake here, it will be shown that the 
work of the hands is brain work; 
there are portions of the work that 
the brain performs while the hand 
acts. The training of the senses is 
the greatest things in the arts. You 
were born with a pretty good brain 
and all you need to do is to sit still 
and it will grow but you have to train 
the senses, (it is a fact that away 
back before Christ there were just as
big brains as exist to-day. They 
wrote just as good poetry and books; 
mathematics had reached clear up 
into the theory of equations in the 
middle ages. At the time that they 
were doing all these things in their 
heads they had an idea that the way 
to perform any physical feat was for 
a man to shut his eyes and think how 
he would do it, not through the sense 
of touch. Now when a man has got 
something the matter with him or 
something to do I like to see him get 
hold of it. The brain grows, we can
not understand just how, but that is 
a part of us, but the senses are largely 
within our control.
Now when you train the senses you 
train your brain as well; you train 
that part f your brain that is apt to 
be neglected; that is what makes a 
man do the sensible things, because 
his eyesight is right, his sense of 
touch is right, his sense of proportion 
is right. It has often been said that 
engineers are clear-headed thinkers, 
it is because their sense of proportion 
is right; these things do not come 
out of your brain, they come out of 
your fingers, of course with your 
brains behind them. When a man 
educated himself by training his 
thought he trains his brain and is edu
cated once but when a man trains 
his senses he trains his brain also and 
the two together are four times as 
great as either one alone.
That man is a man who works and 
who thinks, and the man who never 
thinks about the difference between 
thinking and working is the best kind 
of a man and the kind the world 
wants.

THE TARTAN5
Now, with all this there lias come to 
be a condition of demand in the world.
I happen to be pretty well acquainted 
with that demand; I employ hundreds 
of technical graduates; we want men 
who do things, with knowledgewith 
fundamental knowledge,what I mean 
is the difference between knowledge 
that you have made your own and 
knowledge that you only know exists 
because you read it in a book,a man 
who understands things himself, 
that is what we call fundamental 
knowledge. That class of fundamen
tal knowledge that you get by coming 
in contact with things, you always 
think of it as things men know and 
that you also know, and the thing you 
get right down and dig at and get 
rubbed into you you know and this 
nobody can ever get away from you. 
How the result of it is that you grow 
to be so strong that men want you.
Lots of fellows come in from tech
nical schools to go to work and they 
seem to be equally talented, but there 
will be a certain man that the men 
over in that department they always 
like that certain man. Somehow or 
other everybody wants him; now that 
man has made some kind of uncon
scious feeling upon a large number of 
men that he is associated with that 
they want him to do their work, and 
when a man is wanted his fortune is 
made. There is something also about 
getting done, the things you started 
to do.*******
We must make labor and talent and 
intellectuality go hand in hand. There 
has come to be no difference what
ever in the world. Now I can tell 
you right here rather confidentially 
that I am going to take what we call 
our consulting engineering force (and 
I am doing this with the consent of 
wisest engineers of the company), 
and create a new title and move up 
to the head of the construction de
partment the biggest and best con
struction engineer in that department. 
We recognize construction and handi
craft and the men who come up as 
millwrights working on a plane with 
the highest educated men we have.
Right over here is a great library. 
I dont know whether there are thou
sands or hundreds of thousands of 
volumesyou know they do have 
thousands of volumes in a public li
braryand you are perhaps over
awed by that vast amount of knowl
edge that you dont know; you won
der how in the world you get along 
without it, but I tell you beware of 
the man with, one book because he 
knows what is in it,it is not the 
man with hundreds of books, it is the 
man with one book who is the dan
gerous man in occupation. Y<*u want 
to get yourself in line so that your 
mind and your hands are developed 
just the way that this school plans for 
you, because here in these schools 
there has been eliminated all the 
things that are not worth the doing. 
You have very great opportunities 
and what you want to do is to get up 
and be strong and self-reliant be
cause you are the only one in the 
world that will do anything for your
self; others may not impede you 
much, but if you will be strong and 
be firm and let your hands work right 
straight with your brains you will be 
the kind of engineers, foremen, and 
superintendents and some of you 
managers and some of you presidents; 
some of you will take the highest po
sitions on account of your tempera
ment and individuality that spurs you 
on. If you will just get your hands 
and your brains together you will get 
the most out of it and that is all you 
can do in the matter.-----o-----
Iron and Steel Proof Aga'nst Rust.
Consul Halstead states that an op
tion on the American rights to a 
patent process called sheradizing, 
which it is asserted makes iron and 
steel rust proof and has been used 
successfully in England for a little 
time, has been sold to a firm in New 
York. He adds:
It is claimed for this process that it 
coats iron and steel with zinc as well 
as or better than ordinarv wet gal
vanizing, and that the iron and steel 
thus coated can be brilliantly polish
ed. In the process zinc dust is placed 
in a cylinder which has been brought 
to a temperature of 400 to 500 F.; 
that is, below the melting point of 
zinc. The articles it is desired to 
sheradize are put into the cylinder, 
which is then revolved. The zinc in 
this process is not actually melted, 
but forms an alloy through the sur
face of the articles absorbing the 
zinc, and then a coating covering the 
whole visible surface is deposited to
any desirable thickness. Articles thus 
treated are said to have an even and 
adherent coating which wears excel
lently and does not strip, and that by 
the use of a lime mop are easily 
polished. It had been found that the 
use of the wet galvanizing process 
upon articles on which threads are 
cut made it necessary afterwards to 
recut the threads. This, it is claimed, 
is obviated in the new process, thus 
avoiding both the additional work of 
recutting the threads and also making 
the threads themselves rust proof. 
Another advantage claimed is that be
cause articles are not heated to a high 
temperature the temper of the steel 
is little affected, while its tensile 
strength and that of iron remains the 
same. The owners of the process as
sert that it will obviate the necessity 
of using brass in the manufacture of 
many articles that may rust, an im
portant development in view of the 
high cost of brass. Aluminum and 
antimony can be substituted, it is said, 
for zinc, with success, while when 
copper and its alloys are subjected to 
this process their surface is so hard
ened as to even turn the edge, of a 
steel tool.-----o-----

John L. Hoffman.
Red is usually regarded as the color 
denoting danger. Some of the 12 
boys must have been color-blind and 
lost their courage at sight of the lit
tle white cards sent out by Mr. Leete. 
There are several faces missing. 
Surely they have not become discour
aged. Discouragement is a word 
which has been scratched out of nine
teen twelves dictionary. Dont you 
give in to despair merely because you 
obtained an P or an L for your terms 
work. To obtain all the true good
ness and purest joy.out of a thing, one 
must work for it, and work with his 
coat off and his hands out of his pock
ets. The friends and loves hard
est to win are the ones most valued 
and hardest to forget. Just so it is 
with our lsons. The hardest rule, 
formula or experimentthe ones 
hardest to get and keep are the ones 
which will be hardest to forget. They 
will come bobbing up just when most 
neededas all good friends dojust 
at the critical moment when their ap
plication will mean more than an F 
or an L to you.
You cannot sit at the foot of the 
ladder of success and wish yourself 
up at the top, and then slide up. The 
reverse is more likely to be the case. 
You may be at the topor, at least, 
imagine you have reached that point 
and slide down; may fall down, but 
you can never slide nor fall up. The 
top can only be reached by climbing. 
Remember that
The heights by great men, reached 
and kept,
Were not attained by sudden flight, 
But they, while their companions 
slept,
Were toiling upward in the night.
Some one foolishly dared the pie 
squad to board a car, while munching

second. There, they serenely sat 
down and continued their slight re
past, unconscious (?) of the fact that
the eyes of six young maidens were 
watching their actions, and ignoring 
the hungry looks of their fellow pas
sengers. The conductor was not even 
offered a bite.

Fred Crabtree, B. S., Assistant Pro
fessor in charge of the Department of 
Metallurgical Practice, came to the 
Carnegie Technical Schools in the 
fall of 1907. During that memorable 
fall many memorable things fell, but 
some have come to be more welcome 
to the students than he of the lengthy 
epithet. Coming to the schools with 
a long and enviable record for work 
done in the field of mining and met
allurgy, he has further established a 
reputation among his colleagues here, 
as a man who is ever sure of his 
ground. A sort of oracle, he is, in his 
own. way, for he has never been found 
wanting in anything yet; whether it 
be on demonstrating how to pivot on 
one foot while playing the second base 
position or reproducing a blast fur
nace with seven strokes. And he can 
lecture to you for three hours at a 
qtretch on. the Miocene period.
 The transactions of the American 
Institute of Mining Engineers are to

Junior Prom.
The Junior Prom. Committee have 
about completed tentative arrange

evening of next month. Not to be 
outdone by previous classes, they are 
proceeding on the assumption that 
what is worth doing is worth doing 
well. This spirit is commendable 
and speaks well for the success of 
the first promenade in honor of a

Thistle Board.
The Junior class officers met and 
elected the Junior class representa
tives on the Thistle Board during the 
past week. The men chosen were: 
Chancellor, McFarlane, Charles, Wal
lace, and Sprague. One of these five 
will be elected to the editorship of the 
Thistle, while the election of the editor-in-chief should not be undertaken 
hastily; the men chosen must make 
up their minds quickly and get down 
to work.
The Thistle has been handed over 
in an excellent shape, owing to effi
cient management last year, so the 
present board will undertake their 
work with no handicap of unpaid bills. 
Even with this auspicious start it is 
not going to be an easy matter to 
issue a successful book this year, as 
advertisers are undoubtedly moie 
conservative than formerly. Plenty 
of good, consistent work will over
come this, however, and the year
book can be made better than either 
of its predecessors. The Tartan,
therefore, bespeaks for the Thistle 
Board the assistance of every student 
of the schools.
Tech Loses a Hard Battle.
On Friday evening the basket-ball 
season of the Tech team opened at 
Duquesne Gardens, with Western 
University as opponents. Quite a laige 
crowd was present and much enthusi
asm was shown by both sides. The 
game was fast and furious from the 
start, with the advantage of weight 
in favor of Wup. Neudorfer, the 
Tech leader, was opposed by the mas
sive Bunny Elliot, and had his 
hands full. Ralston, the lightest man 
on the Tech team, played a plucky 
game, but was a little nervous when 
called upon to throw fouls. Lytle 
played a good game, but his work in 
the second half deserves commenda
tion. Leety and Buhl did well for 
Tech, as did Elliot and Patterson for 
Wup. Line-up and score:

THE REFERI N DEXA NEW SYS
TEM OF INDEXING.
Especially Adapted to the Needs of 
Engineer.
A broad feature of tjie system is 
that so far as any one man is con
cerned the one book will generally be 
capable of referindexing any subBy Prof. G. H. Follows.
The following article is reprinted 
from the Tartan of April 3, 1907, by 
special request:
Several years ago I formed the 
habit of making notes of the work I 
was doing, and of its progress. I 
first used for the purpose a special 
printed form bound as a book in a 
suitable cover labeled Subject Book. 
It was a Subject Book because the 
main feature of each entry was the 
name of the subject upon which work 
was being done. The work might be 
making a note,, looking up data, issu
ing instructions, experimenting in the 
shop, corresponding, designing, mak
ing a general investigation, filing 
printed matter, reading an article or 
what not.
This subject book, itself intended a?, 
an index, soon needed an index, .and 
I tried several schemes. The best I 
could say of each, after a fair trial, 
was that it worked all right for a 
wliile, which was just what I did not 
want. What I was looking for was 
a system of indexing that would an
swer for all time, and yet never grow 
cumbersome or require re-arranging, 
and that at the same time would not 
be too much trouble to keep up.
The Referindex described and il
lustrated here is the name that I have 
given to the general system of index
ing that finally evolved; the coined 
word being simply a contraction of 
reference index.
The system as I use it, is embodied 
in a three-part book in three colors; 
the parts are Numerical, Alphabetical 
and Reference; in yellows green and 
white respectively. In addition to this 
Reference Book the system requires 
what I have called an Indexer. A 
small section of this indexer and of 
two other forms used in making the 
book are shown in Fig. No. 1

ject in any place as long as he lives, 
without the necessity of any re-ar
rangement.
The main purpose of the system is 
to make the process of indexing the 
same for all kinds of data in all kinds 
of places, and to make it easy to lo
cate any indexed information without 
being dependent upon memory.
The book as I use it is sihown in 
Fig. No. 2. It will be seen that the 
three parts are so put together and 
thumb-indexed that the pages are me
chanically located. The indexer form 
is used to either bind or paste into 
tihe front of any book or collection of 
data.
The subjects are arranged nu
merically bS well as alphabetically. 
The numbers are from 1 to 100 in 
series from 1 up; so that a subject 
number consists of two parts, as 47j3, 
the meaning of which is subject 47 
of series 3. This subject number
is the base of the whole system, as 
will be understood from the following 
description of how it is used, in con
nection with an example, thus:
I decide to enter on page 8G of Noite 
Book No. 1 the results of some ex
periments on twist drills. It is the first 
datum I have entered anywhere re
lating to drills and the subject is 
therefore new to my Referindex.
In Figs. 1 and 2 the entries made 
in the complete referindexing of this 
subject are marked with a cross, to 
make it ea?ier for the reader to follow 
the method and the case in point:
First: Enter subject in Numerical
index opposite the next available 
number, using the best general 
heading you can think of. In this 
case the next available number is 
47 of series 3 and the general head
ing is Drills.
Second: Enter subject in the Alpha
betical index in as many places as 
you think advisable, always in con
nection with the subject number. 
In this case, under D in column 
r, the entry made is 4713 Drills,

Fourth: Turn to the assigned refer
ence page,, enter the subject num

and make the desired reference.
In this case the reference is N. B.

Fifth: Turn to the indexer of Note
Bock No. 1, and opposite 47 make 
entry 3|86.
Here the 3 is the series of the 47, 
and 8G is the page for the note.
If at any future time I wish to lo
cate this note, I turn to the alphabet
ical index and find that drill tests have 
subject number 47|3. Turning then 
to series 3, subject 47, I am referred 
to reference page 5, where, opposite 
47|3, I find Reference N. B. No. 1. 
Opening Note Book No. 1 at the in
dexer, I immediately see opposite 47 
the entry 3|86, and the note is located. 
Perhaps the above seems complicated

and cumbersome, but the proof of a 
pudding is in the eating, not in an 
itemized list of its contents; and in 
actual  use this system has proved 
simplicity itself and a great time-andworry-saver. The original indexing 
of an entirely new subject is in point 
of fact done very quickly, and the 
finding of previously indexed data is 
a matter of seconds only. The whole 
thing is clean cut in every particular.
The simplicity of the system is per
haps best indicated by Fig. 4, which 
is a summary of all the entries written 
in the case in point.
The more . comprehensive the Ref
erindex Book becomes, the fewer ad
ditions have to be made to it. In
stead of having many indexes in as 
many places, and therefore the same 
subject repeated in many indexes 
without any direct connection between 
them, I have one Referindex Book, in 
which the indexing of any one subject 
under as many headings alphabeti
cally as is deemed wise, becomes of 
permanent and general value in con
nection with any number of books and 
any kind of receptacle for notes or 
data.

After extended use the one Refer
ence Book becomes so comprehensive 
that it is not very often necessary to 
add a new subject to the nummerical 
index, the additions being mostly new 
references to subjects, already num
bered.
In the application of this system to 
the making of notes and the collect
ing of data, I use a rubber stamp as 
shown in Fig. 3, stamping all loose 
notes, correspondence, sketches, the 
pages of note books, data cards, etc. 
The stamp acts as a frame to receive 
the subject number which then serves 
the purpose of a cross index. Loose 
papers and data cards always circu
late back to their proper places when 
so marked and numbered.
Referring again to Fig. 1, it should 
be noted that in this system there is 
very little writing to be done, the 
subjects may be said to classify them
selves, there is practically no waste 
space, and no matter where a note 
may be it can be found with the same 
ease. The use of printed forms, made 
convenient by the system, brings all 
references to the same subject in 
identically the same relative position 
on every indexer, so that there is no 
hunting through unclassified lists. 
The columnizing of the alphabetical

---------------------------------------------------

12THE TARTAN
index is another feature worth no
ticing, there being a column for the
first twofetters of '?ny word in the 
English language; this makes it prac
tically unnecessary ever to re-arrange 
what has once been entered.
The numbering in series of 100
makes possible the printing of all sub
ject numbers directly on to forms, and 
tends towards general compactness.
So far as the general workings of 
the system and its mechanical feat
ures are concerned the above will per
haps suffice. There are other feat
ures, however, not evident on the sur
face, that go to make the whole sys
tem of great value and render it ex
ceedingly comfortable in practical ap
plication. I will mention some that 
have been found useful:
No matter how careful one may be 
in deciding on tihe classification of a 
subject, one is likely to discover later 
that a sub-division or different classi
fication would be a good thing. Take 
the example cited: I may accumulate 
so many data in so many places rela
tive to drills that I would prefer to 
sub-divide; in such a case all I have 
to do is to add the divisional refer
ences in the referindex under new 
subject numbers, and make the neces
sary entries in the indexers concern
ed. The notes themselves are not 
disturbed in any way, but the referin
dex as a key to them is rendered more 
definite at the small cost of making a 
few entries in the indexers.
Again, it sometimes happens that 
one would like to connect different 
subjects together, because they bear 
upon one another in some useful way. 
When this is so it merely needs a 
cross reference. For example: I
might wish to connect subject 47|3 
with subject 3512 (Radial Drill De
sign). (Each of these subjects has a 
line on page 5, Fig. 1, where the cross 
references shown are all that are 
necessary.
For indexing articles in magazines, 
catalogues, books of any kind, the 
system adapts itself very happily. 
For all such work the indexer is used 
in the same way as explained in con
nection with Note Book No. 1. Index
ers for different publications can be 
kept together in suitable cover, and 
when a years numbers, as, say, of the 
Engineering News, are bound as a 
volume, the indexer is bound with 
them, and becomes in connection with
the referindex book a classified guide 
to the articles that have proved in
teresting during the year, and of 
course can be made more complete as 
occasion requires.
I might mention many other feat
uresmatters of detail'that go to 
make this system of indexing a 
uniquely elastic and complete one, but 
what I would prefer to emphasize is 
that it renders unnecessary any spe
cial or studied arrangement of notes 
or data as they are made or collected, 
so that no matter how varied the char
acter of the data may be, or in how 
many places they may be stowed 
away, the system classifies them and 
makes it easy to locate any desired 
item.
-----o-----
Technical Training.
At the December meeting of the 
Western Railway Club a paper on the 
subject of technical education was 
presented by Mr. Richard T. Crane, 
Sr., president of the Crane Company. 
The paper urged the futility of tech
nical education, maintaining that col
lege education seems almost fatal to 
success in the business domain as 
technical graduates will be distanced 
by clerks and mechanics.
On the second day after the presen
tation of this paper, the following 
editorial appeared in the columns of 
the Chicago Daily Tribune:
Large amounts of money have been 
given by practical men of affairs to 
establish and endow technical schools. 
The fact that, having been denied the 
advantages of training in the schools, 
they desire to give better opportuni
ties to people of another generation is 
a pretty good reason for the existence 
of such institutions. It probably is 
true that the greater part of the mill
ions given to higher education of 
whatever sort has come from the 
bounty of men who made their wealth 
without having had the advantages of 
the training which they seek to give 
to those who are to follow them. It 
is unreasonable to suppose that large 
endowments would be given in this 
way if the self-made donors did not 
realize their own loss because of the 
lack of educational opportunities.
Another fact is equally apparent. 
The technical schools cannot turn out 
well equipped men fast enough to 
meet the constant demand for their
services. Any professor of standing 
will bear testimony that the requests 
made for trained men <in his depart
ment exceed the available supply. In 
many of the technical schools the 
members of the graduating classes 
are placed before they receive their 
diplomas, leaving the institution on 
commencement day to begin work in 
positions. In some lines no one but 
such a graduate can secure a place. 
Such a condition of things is elo
quent of the worth of technical train
ing.
If a thousand men whose training 
was limited to a grammar school 
course and practical experience in the 
shop were selected and put side by 
side with another thousand from 
Rensselaer, Massachusetts Institute, 
the Sibley School, Purdue, Stevens 
Institute, Worcester Polytechnic, and 
similar technical schools the chances 
are many that the latter group would 
furnish the larger number of efficient 
and successful workers. If the at
tainments of the entire body of grad
uates of American technical schools 
were compared with those of an equal 
number of workers without any ad
vantages of the schools the result 
would not be doubtful.
The captains of industry are rela
tively few. Their success often has 
been due to native genius. Some
times peculiar conditions have helped 
them forward. Leadership in other 
fields has come in the same way. 
Those who have been trained for 
command often have failed complete
ly. But where one man has gone 
from the grammar school and the 
four years observation in the shop 
to the head of a great establishment 
there have been thousands who have 
trudged their way through life with 
little enjoyment of its opportunities, 
with relatively small influence upon 
their fellows, and with a horizon lim
ited by the walls of the factory.
Hundreds of educated men have 
wasted their chances. Hundreds 
have failed completely in a chosen 
profession. Leadership among them 
may have been less frequent than it 
should have been. But the great ma
jority of those who crowd the tech
nical schools to overflowing are there 
because of the encouragement of em
ployers or friends who tell them of 
the better opportunities open to .those 
who are educated. It is not by the

A. F. Stamm, Editor.
Locke, R. W., of 1911 (not the emi
nent scientist and philosopher), thinks 
that the art of manicuring is not taken 
seriously enough by the young men 
of today. Glasser, of B-2, is a recent 
convert to the Locke school.
Feathers Flynn, of the Industrials, 
has again made his appearance as the 
agent for class pins.
iStamm (to Wilharm in the Lab.)  
Please put that old pipe under the 
hood, as the fumes are something 
rank.
From the number of Ls, Ps and 
Fs in electricity one would imagine 
that 1911 is a wierd lot of electricians.
If the feeling exhibited at the W. 
U. P.-Tech basket-ball game can be 
taken as a criterion there will be hot 
times when W. TJ. P. is located on 
their new site.
The social committee is still re
ceiving congratulations on the success 
of the smoker held December 20, 1907.
PuzzleWho has the large Rens
selaer banner that so mysteriously 
disappeared after the hockey game?
It pays to belong to the Mandolin 
Club, as these fellows were able to 
ring in on the girls reception last 
Tuesday evening.
Last year shortly after the Thistle 
went to press the class of 1911 was 
accused of disloyalty, lack of spirit, 
close-fistedness and other things 
simply because they stuck by a prin
ciple. The Thistle Board last year, 
their statement to the contrary not
withstanding, failed to accord the 
class a representative and they made 
the charge contained in the foregoing 
simply because the sale of the book 
did not come up to their preconceived 
ideas.
Now the purpose of this article is 
not to censure the Board but merely 
to justify those of the class of 1911
who signed to take the book but who 
canceled their orders on learning of 
the gross oversight cn the part of the 
Board. Another, and secondary ob
ject is to call the attention of the new 
Thistle Beard to the existence of the 
class of live ones who know how 
and who certainly will remember any 
slight put them.
With the infusion of young blood 
from 1912 the Pie Squad bids fair 
to become a permanent organization. 
Twenty-two recruits at the last meet
ing when six is a quorum is going 
some.
All .the fussers in 1911 are anx
iously awaiting an invitation from the 
girls for a sleigh ride.
It certainly will be strange if the 
M. M. C. S. girls would invite the boys 
over to see their beautiful building 
and incidentally give us a little dance.
Fred Geyer, of B-2, night school, 
is quite a joker. The other day in 
reading the dimensions of a flange, 
read 15 B. C. as 15 inches before 
Christ.
Firmly believing that whatever is 
done by the Athletic Board will be in 
the best interest of all athletics at 
Tech, 1911 is going to stand pat and 
and their attitude on the athletic sit
uation is plainly shown by the action 
of the social committee in turning 
over the proceeds of the recent smo
ker. Twenty-five dollars ($25.00) 
will be handed to the Athletic Board 
as soon as the necessary formalities 
have been observed such as filing a 
report, drawing the warrant, etc. That 
is a little better proof that money 
talks.
The next game of basket-ball with 
Western University will take place on 
Friday, February 21st, at Duquesne 
Gardens.
Michigan is shortly to have an 
earthquake station. Seismographs 
have already been ordered and the 
station when equipped will, it is said, 
be superior to any other in the coun
try. At present Michigan is offering 
the only course in seismic geology 
given anywhere outside of Japan.

Lowell W. Nicols, Editor.
The election of class officers, held 
last Wednesday morning, proved to 
be a very interesting affair. Alter 
the usual preliminaries, sufficient red 
tape was unwound to do up the entire 
proceeding in a proper manner, and 
the meeting got down to business. 
Mclntire made a clever and pointed 
rpeech, in which he advocated the rei election of the former officers, and 
| the results of the election certainly 
show that the class had this in mind 
when they cast their ballots. Mead 
raised quite a commotion by moving 
|Jthe nominations for president closed 
just after his name had been proposed 
and has spent the remainder of the 
week endeavoring to persuade every
one that he didnt hear the nomina
tion. A motion was passed making 
the office of historian permanent for 
the year. The results were: Presi
dent, Martin; vice president, Bright; 
secretary, Keck; treasurer, R. S. War
ner.
After the solemn ceremony of the 
inauguration was over, the newly 
elected officers held a public reception 
in the gorgeous and beautifully dec
orated hallway. Receiving with the 
officials were the section leaders, and 
other class notables, while nearer the 
doorway were the five beauties. 
Among the handsome gowns worn, 
must be mentioned that of the hostess, 
a bewitchingly dreamy creation of 
point-de-sprit' lace over white inser
tion. Cut high in the neck, and made 
princess it emphasized the natural 
beauties of the wearer, a racing bru
nette. Hung low from the waist line, 
were accordeon-plaited panniers of 
pale green liberty silk, having an 
edging of box-plaited rouching cut on 
the bias. The center panel of the 
skirt, was trimmed with black jet 
spangles with real lace and medall
ions set in with shadow work em
broidery. A tissue paper hat set the 
entire costume off in a becoming man
ner. The aides wore maroon plush, 
gored, and trimmed with pink and 
chrome green.
An orchestra half concealed by
palms and tropical foliage discoursed 
delightful music. Refreshments were 
served in the spacious banquet hall, 
which was brilliantly decorated for 
the affair. The event was the first 
of a series that will be given during 
the remainder of the season.
Mr. Bickley, whose name has ap
peared in this column before, had a 
rather novel adventure just after 
school one day last week. Walking 
with several companions from the end 
of the bridge to the rear of the Insti
tute, the wind in a frolicksome mood 
lifted his hat from its correct position 
and quickly placed it on the very 
edge of the bank. His friends paused 
while he went to recover the head
gear, and stood agape when he sud
denly disappeared, when within two 
or three feet of the brink. The wind 
had blown the snoiw into a peculiar 
drift at that point, which promptly 
gave way the moment Bickley stepped 
on it. Rolling over and over he be
came entangled in the branches of a 
tree part way down, and after several 
vain attempts succeeded in regainiing 
his equilibrium. Calmly brushing the 
snow off the book he had kept hold of 
during his descent, he bowed an ac
knowledgement to the cheers of the 
onlookers lining the bridge, and start
ed to climb up, as though it was an 
every-day occurrence with him.
The champion high jumpers of the 
class are Martin and Borseneck. The 
former was transferred from Section 
u* to A, and the latter from E to A. 
Congratulations.
Owing to the resignation of Geo.
B. Barrett from his former position of 
chief refuter of arguments advanced 
by Jos. Wilson, Jr., it is absolutely 
necessary to have a successor ap
pointed at the earliest date possible. 
Suggestions for possible applicants 
will be received by any member of the 
Plebe class.

The Quadrangler Chess league, 
composed of Columbia, Harvard, Yale 
and Princeton, will challenge Oxford 
and Cambridge to an international 
tourney between representatives of 
England and American universities, 
the match to be played by cable this 
spring. Representatives from Cornell 
and the University of Pennsylvania 
will probably be asked to participate.
The committee appointed by the 
National Lumber Manufacturers as
sociation to look after obtaining $150,- 
OuO to endow a professorship of lum
bering in the Yale forest school, has 
reported that the subscriptions to date 
amount to $67,500. Fifty thousand 
of this endowment, in bonds, has al
ready been turned turned over to 
Yale University, the income of which 
will be used for instruction in applied 
forestry and lumbering.
The Columbia faculty has decided 
that the rules for which bar students 
from participation in athletics when 
they are delinquent in classes shall 
not be enforced until 1910, but that 
all cases shall be considered individ
ually. It was found that if the rule 
were enforced, 70 per cent, of the uni
versitys athletes would be ruled out, 
for insufficient entrance preparation.
The great English scientist, Lord 
Kelvin, who died recently at the age 
of 83 years, resigned his professor
ship at Glasgow eight years ago, but 
still desiring to maintain his connec

as a student.
Two students of Colorado College 
sought revenge for being expelled 
from college because of cheating, and 
smashed twenty windows in Palmer 
Hall, the science building of the col
lege, and also cut down two large 
elm trees on the campus. Both were 
arrested the following morning and 
they confessed. The college authori
ties have determined to prosecute the
defendants to the full extent o fthe 
law.
A novel plan is in operation at Ohio 
Wesleyan in connection with the flag 
rush. The Sophomores and Fresh
men are provided with foot-ball tick
ets. The class which sells the largest 
number of tickets receives a ten-foot 
start in the rush for the flag.
Dr. John Hiram Bingham, lecturer 
on South American History and Geog
raphy in Yale University, has given 
the university library a valuable col
lection of works, covexing South 
American events and affairs, particu
larly during the evolutionary periods. 
The collection comprises about 4,000 
volumes.
A school of nurses is conducted at 
the University of Michigan. The 
course extends over a period of three 
years, preceded by a probationary at
tendance of two months. All the reg

by the school.
Drake University is jubilant over 
the fact that its registration mark is

The prospect of a Freshman debate 
with Northwestern University, which 
those interested in debating are try

In order to Jnsure themselves 
against any damages which might hap
pen as a result of the collapse of the 
Northrop Field bleachers, Minnesota 
has taken out $20,000 accident insur

The fraternity houses of North
western seem to be regarded by the 
light-fingered gentry as particularly 
easy. The Sigma Chi House at that 
institution was recently entered by a 
masked burglar and the inmates re
lieved of several hundred dollars in 
jewelry and money. This is the third 
instance of the kind and the students 
are greatly aroused.
The University of Wisconsin now 
has a medical department by the au
thorization of the last legislature of 
that State. Only the first two years 
of the course will be given, the plan 
being to allow the students to enter 
as juniors at other schools of medicine 
after the two years spent at the State 
University.
