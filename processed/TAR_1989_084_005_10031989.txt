Fraternities debate alcohol policy, role of CFP

In response to fraternities prob
lems acquiring liabilityinsurance 
and chapters fears of losing fra
ternity charters, the Council of 
Fraternity Presidents is consid
ering tightening restrictions on
alcohol use at CFP events.
The council had an open meet
ing last week to discuss proposals 
which would eliminate alcohol at 
CFP-sponsored events as well as 
tighten controls on alcohol use at 
individual fraternities.
I think that this fall, national 
organizations have decided that
the time has come to look at alco
hol use of their chapters, said 
Director of Greek Affairs Ron 
Campana.
Some [national] officials have 
said that if their chapter is violat
ing the University alcohol policy, 
theyre going to pull the charter 
off the wall and throw it into the

Incidents at campuses across 
the country, such as the murder 
of Robert Morris College student 
Jeanne Goldberg by former Car
negie Mellon student Darrell Van 
Mastrigt three years ago, and the 
death of a fraternity pledge at 
Rutgers University, have forced 
fraternity nationals to band to
gether to purchase insurance.
A group of over twenty national 
fraternities, including nine rep
resented at Carnegie Mellon, are 
members of the Fraternity Insur
ance Purchase Group. The FIPG 
has become active in instituting 
risk management programs at 
member fraternities and their 
chapters to limit the chances of 
liability suits.
Concerns over alcohol in the 
Greek system have been brought 
up at CFP meetings since last 
year, according to CFP Rush Chair 
Fred Goff, a Sigma Alpha Epsilon 
brother. Lastweeks meeting was 
an opportunity for all fraternity 
members to express their opin
ions to CFP. The Council will meet 
behind closed doors Thursday to 
make a decision.
The fraternities agree thatthey 
need to consider alcohol use and
abuse at fraternity events. Al
ready, alcohol can no longer be 
served at CFP-sponsored events 
such as the Watermelon Bash. 
CFP is also looking into various 
ways to keep alcohol abuse under 
control at parties. Ideas included: 
having taxicabs or sober frater
nity brothers to drive intoxicated 
partygoers home, providing space 
to sleep off the effects of alcohol, 
and increasing the use ofthe CMU 
shuttle and escort service.
However, the fraternities do not 
agree on the role CFP should take 
in enforcing any policies on indi
vidual houses. Alpha Tau Omega 
President Brian Mikol feels that 
CFP should adopt a policy that 
limits fraternity liability. Were 
not doing this because our na
tional wants to take our charter. 
Were doing things because we 
feel responsible for the invited 
guests who come to our house, 
said Mikol Thursday.
ATO has already taken steps to 
limit liability at its parties. The 
fraternity has stopped serving 
alcohol from kegs at parties, and 
has moved to a BYOB policy. 
Thursday, Mikol also stated that 
ATO would soon start to check

The two story addition to Mar
garet Morrison Carnegie Hall that 
was to have been started this fall 
has been postponed because of 
higher than anticipated construc
tion costs.
The lowest bid for the project 
was $900,000 higher than ex
pected. The University antici
pated a bid of $2.2 million; how
ever, the lowest bid was $3.1 
million.
The addition is the second in a 
three-phase renovation of Mar
garet Morrison. The first phase of 
the project, which between 7 0 and 
80 percent completed, involvesthe 
partial renovation of existing 
space and public areas to restore 
the building to its original 1912 
form. Departments from the Col
lege of Fine Arts were assigned 
space in the building during this 
phase. The third and final phase 
would be the completion and
renovation of existing space as a 
permanent design.
The renovation plans are a part 
of a plan to consolidate the Col
lege of Fine Arts in Margaret 
Morrison and CFA, expanding 
classroom and studio space for 
the college in the process. Accord
ing to Design Department Head 
Carroll M. Gantz, the Margaret 
Morrison consolidation project 
has been in progress for approxi
mately three years.
In phase two, builders will con
struct a new two-story addition 
located behind the current build
ing.
This new building, which would 
be attached to Margaret Morri
son, would provide new wood shop 
facilities for both the Architec
ture and Industrial Design De
partments and would offer new 
studio space.
The roof of this addition would

Plans are underway to begin 
addressing student desires for 24- 
hour facilities. TheUniversity will 
again test 24-hour service at the 
Tatan Grill as they did at the end 
of last semester, but has decided 
against extending library hours.
Patricia Fitzgerald, assistant 
director of libraries for public 
services, feels that a trial period 
of 24-hour service in university 
libraries is not feasible. Basi
cally we dont have the money to 
do this.... if what youre looking 
for at 4 am is study space, this is 
really expensive real estate as
You dont want people studying 
alone at 5 am; theyre easy targets 
for muggers, thieves, rapists, and 
wackos B they like universities.

study space. If youre looking for 
use of library materials, thats 
reasonable; if youre looking for 
full service of the library, thats 
incredibly expensive.
Those extra hours from Mon
day to Sunday for the entire build
ing, including instructional tech
nology and the clusterbecause 
people really want the cluster 
more than the library  would 
cost somewhere between $1300 
and $2000 a week, which is 
$45,000 to $65,000 a year. Even
that depends on the availability 
ofwork-study students. She also 
pointed out that there is an in
creased expense in dealing with 
full time employees,who would 
also receive fringe benefits.
Fitzgerald was also concerned 
about finding sufficient and quali
fied staff during those hours. Who 
do you get to work at 4 am? Even 
now, staying open until 3 am, we 
sometimes have a problem filling 
the night supervisor position. You 
must have a full-time adult in 
charge at these hours because you 
dont want an inexperienced per
son supervising all the people and 
equipment, as well as being re
sponsible for the security of the
entire building, especially in the 
event of a fire or blackout or other 
emergency.
Accordingto Fitzgerald, current 
demand for 24-hour service of the 
library is not sufficient to justify 
the cost and and the potential 
staffing problems. There is some 
concern about it, sure, but we 
dont have students protesting on 
the lawn every day about this. 
Citing 24-hour plans at other 
universities libraries, Fitzgerald 
notes that they are usually done 
in a discreet area that can be 
closed off [from the rest of the; 
library] and that has rest rooms 
and all ofthe amenities, which we

The House of Representatives 
Subcommittee on Science, Re
search, and Technology held a 
hearing on Robotics Technology 
last Monday at the Carnegie 
Mellon Robotics Institutes Field 
Robotics Center. The hearing 
focused on the applications of 
robotics in three areas: hazard
ous waste cleanup, health care, 
and automated manufacturing 
processes.
In his opening remarks, sub
committee chair Doug Walgren 
(D-Penn.) cited Carnegie Mellon 
as the nations leader in robotics 
research. He expressed his feel
ing that there is a need for the 
U.S. to use science and technol
ogy to increase its economic com
petitiveness. Robotics technology 
is potentially a very powerful tool 
for increasing this countrys eco
nomic growth and for improving 
our quality of life, he said.
The first discussion dealt with 
the uses of robotics in cleaning
hazardous waste. Dr. William 
Whittaker, director of the Field 
Robotics Center, spoke of the 
development of field robots at the 
Center. He explained that robots 
could be put to use in dangerous 
jobs.
Vincent Esposito, manager of 
Westinghouses Nuclear Service

Vandal strikes at DTD; officials 
cut Fridays pledge party short
Vandalism at Delta Tau Delta cut short the celebrations of fall 
pledge night. According to DTD President John Bush, a heatsensing fire alarm was tom off a ceiling, causing a short-circuit 
that set off the fire alarm system in the house.
The Pittsburgh Fire Department responded to the alarm, and 
upon investigation of the affected area, determined that the 
alarm system would not be able to be reactivated that evening. 
Because of this, officials told DTD brothers that they would not 
be able to continue the party, and that only DTD brothers would 
be able to enter the house. Campus Police were on the scene to 
ensure that no unauthorized persons entered the building.
Fire Department officials informed the fraternity that they 
would return for a formal inspection of the premises on Monday. 
Officials would not comment as to whether any other houses 
would be inspected at that time.
CMU Womens Center to open 
in Margaret Morrison Plaza
The CMU Womens Center will open in the next couple of 
months to serve the campus as a place where information and 
programs on womens issues can be provided and discussed 
informally by both men and women.
The creation of a womens center was proposed in the spring of 
1989 by members of the Womens Issue Collective, and unani
mously supported in a Student Senate resolution. Members of 
the Collective examined comparable colleges, most of which had 
a womens center, in developing a proposal for CMU. Planning 
and developing for the Center is a colloborative effort of students 
drawn from various organization, as well as staff such as Dean 
of Student Affairs Mike Murphy, Director of Housing Tony 
Martin, Counseling Center Director Lorrie Rabin, and Panhel.
The goal of the Center, according to Womens Issue Collective 
member Nathan Long, is to to provide services and information 
for women who need it and to promote awareness of womens 
issues in a space where women can feel comfortable and ex
change ideas."
The Center will also provide a meeting place for womens 
groups on campus such as the Collective, Women for Women, and 
Society of Women Engineers. Student Government President 
Mark Mittelhauser emphasizes that the Center is open to all 
members of the CMU community.
Student Affairs and the Housing Office have allocated funds 
for the establishment of a resource center and programming; 
Student Senate has also expressed an interest in contributing 
monetary support.
Morrisons (Margaret Morrison room #105) is the most likely 
candidate for the center. The center would be open from 11 am 
to 8 pm, staffed by student or faculty volunteers. From 8 pm to 
midnight Morrisons will continue to be a Housing study area.
Programs would feature speakers, workshops, videotapes, and 
afternoon discussion groups. The Womens Issues Collective is 
also currently compiling a book list for the facilitys resource 
center of donated and loaned books.
Anyone interested in volunteering can call 421-3459 or drop a 
note in mailbox at the Skibo Information Desk.

Britain, China 
discuss future of 
Hong Kong
LONDON (DJ)  British offi
cials, pressing for pledges that 
China will preserve human rights 
and capitalism in Hong Kong, held 
their first talks with Chinese 
representatives since last Junes 
crackdown in Tiananmen Square.
British sources said privately 
that the exchanges at the start of 
the three-day talks were robust, 
underlining the change in atmos
phere since Beijings suppression 
of pro-democracy students.
In remarks to reporters outside 
the Foreign Office, British dele
gation leader Robin McLaren an 
undersecretary at the Foreign 
Office, said the mood was good.
The chief Chinese delegate said 
there was a frank exchange 
during the initial three-hour 
meeting.
This is the first meeting after a 
long stop, Ke Zaishuo, a Chinese 
ambassador leading the delega
tion, told reporters. The talks 
were useful and there was a frank 
exchange of opinions.
The Joint Liaison Group of 
British, Hong Kong and Chinese 
officials is supposed to meet regu
larly.
British sources said that, in 
particular, Britain is seeking to 
persuade China to reconsider 
plans to station units of the

Kong after 1997.
Marcos dies in 
Honolulu at 72
HONOLULU (AP)  Ferdi
nand E. Marcos, former president 
of the Philippines, died here Fri
day, ending in exile a life that had 
taken him to the pinnacles of 
power and worldwide notoriety. 
He was 72.
He died at 12:40 am, according 
to Eugene Tiwanak, spokesman 
at St. Francis Medical Center, 
where Marcos had been hospital
ized for nine months with kidney, 
lung and heart ailments, pneu
monia and bacterial infections.
Marcos only son, Ferdinand Jr., 
said no funeral arrangements 
have been made.
Marcos successor, President 
Corazon Aquino, said May 19 she 
would not permit Marcos to be 
buried on Philippine soil, despite 
appeals from his wife.
Mrs. Marcos said in April she 
would embalm her husbands body 
and display it in Hawaii until she 
could return and scatter his ashes 
to fertilize the Philippines.
The canny, combative politician, 
who governed at times as a demo
crat, at times as a dictator, was 
driven from the presidency in 
1986, after which he settled into 
exile in Honolulu at a hillside 
estate overlooking the Pacific.
Marcos died without facing trial 
on U.S. criminal charges stem
ming from his alleged plundering 
of the Philippine treasury during 
his two decades in power.
A federal grand jury in New 
York indicted Marcos, his wife 
and eight others on criminal rack
eteering charges in October. In 
April, the judge in the case separated Marcos from the other de
fendants, saying he was too ill to\ 
stand trial.
Marcos was elected president 
of his Asian homeland in 1966 
and ruled longer than any other 
Philippine president.
Violence worsens

BOGOTA, Colombia (AP)The' 
Colombian military patrolled the

city of Cartagena today, search

another bomb blast blamed on 
drug traffickers killed two people 
and injured one at a Hilton hotel.
Two other bombs exploded yes
terday in Cartegena and Bogota.
Today, a Cabinet minister was 
to meet with representatives of

them from drug gangs.
Senate unable 
to strike cat 
insurance deal
WASHINGTON (AP)  The 
Senate Finance Committee found 
no agreement Tuesday on a new 
plan to prevent repeal of cata
strophic medical insurance for 
retirees.
There obviously is not biparti
san support for any proposal at 
this point, committee chairman 
Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, told 
reporters after a closed session.
The administration says it is 
for the [new] package but I dont 
see any Republican members for 
the package, he said.
Sen. David Durenberger, RMinn., said he saw signs mem
bers might be drawing closer to a 
compromise. Bentsen, he said, is 
swimming uphill and he ought to 
have Republicans, he ought to 
have the president in the boat 
with him.
The year-old program, designed 
to prevent a serious illness from 
financially ruining retirees, is
under attack from many older 
Americans.
Some object because they al
ready have catastrophic coverage 
and some higher-income retirees 
are upset because they must pay 
a large share of the programs 
cost.
The House Ways and Means 
Committee has agreed to shift 
more of the cost to those with 
lower incomes, allow retirees to 
drop coverage if they also give up 
Medicare Part B (physicians fees), 
and to scale back reimbursement 
for prescriptions.
There are indications the House 
may vote to repeal the program.
The latest proposal considered 
would cut the $800 maximum 
annual surtax paid by higherincome retirees to $400; slow 
scheduled increases in the $4-amonth flat fee for catastrophic 
coverage that most retirees pay; 
permit beneficiaries to drop cata
strophic protection if they also 
give up Medicare Part B; require 
retirees to pay more of physicians 
fees before the new protection 
kicks in; and eliminate coverage 
for most prescription drugs.
U.S., Soviets 
talk of chemical 
weapons cuts
WASHINGTON (DJ)ABush 
Administration spokesman said 
remarks Tuesday by Soviet For
eign Minister Eduard Shevard
nadze show that the U.S. and the 
Soviet Union are on the same 
wavelength regarding U.S. pro
posals to reduce chemical weap
ons.
Shevardnadze told the United 
Nations in New York that his 
government will cooperate with 
the U.S. to radically reduce or 
completely destroy all stockpiled 
chemical weapons. He also said 
that the Soviet Union will stop 
producing such weapons.
At a White House press confer
ence, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Bush aides were still 
studying Shevardnadzes state
ments but that the statement 
seemed in line with U.S. desires. 
Minister Shevardnadzes com
ments this morning show we are 
on the same wavelength and our
ultimate objective is elimination 
of chemical weapons, Fitzwater 
said.
Speaking yesterday before the 
UN, President Bush offered to cut^ 
eighty percent of U.S. chemical 
weapons stockpiles. The propos
als were designed to spur a fortynation conference in Geneva to 
ban all chemical weapons within 
ten years.
Earlier today, Bush sought and 
generally received support for his 
proposals from bi-partisan con
gressional leaders.
After meeting centering on for
eign policy initiatives, House 
speaker Thomas Foley (D-Wash)' 
called the Bush proposals a good 
first step.

really dont have here. 
Fitzgerald proposes keeping the 
dining halls open at night as an 
alternative, for several reasons.
* -It allows people to eat food as 
well as creating a secure density 
I people. You dont want people 
" studying alone at 5 am, theyre 
1 easy targets for muggers, theives, 
rapists, and wackos  they like 
i universities.
Dining Service has already 
started along the road of 24-hour 
trial service. Jim Gurley, director 
of dining services, recounts the 
trial that was conducted last year: 
j We conducted the trial at the 
" Tartan Grill, because of its cen
tral location, during the final 
exam period last spring. Unfortunately, we had a water main break 
1 in Skibo ... so the trial got disj jointed.... I cant say that when 
were able to provide the 24 hour 
service, there was really a cam
pus-wide knowledge of it to give it 
a good fair test.
I am prepared to run another 
trial period during this semesters 
final exam period, Gurley said, 
and promote it more heavily so 
that we can get a truer test of 
what kind of demand is really out 
there ... We would like to survey 
the students that will be involved 
in the upcoming trial to try and 
gauge what the participation in 
regular 24 hour service would be.
Another issue on Gurleys mind 
is the type of services the night 
shift of the 24-hour plan should 
provide. The trial last year did 
tell us that people werent inter
ested in the regular menu, they 
wanted more of the breakfast type 
of items like the coffee and dough
nuts. Hopefully with this upcom
ing trial we can learn to more 
effectively cater to the demand 
that is out there.
Addressing the financial aspect
of the plan, Gurley noted, We 
believe that on the basis of total 
revenues compared to total costs 
that the operation would not 
support itself. This however, 
would not be prohibitive in itself. 
We see it as a service and that 
there is a demand for it, although 
how much of a demand remains 
to be seen.
According to Gurley, there are 
factors that would help to offset 
the cost of the plan. We also see 
it as a possible opportunity for 
dining service to look at that [late] 
shift as an opportunity to staff 
employees to do other prepara
tion duties for the next day of 
service.
We look towards utilizing the 
manpower in ways that would 
make it beneficial to the depart
ment and ultimately provide the 
service, incorporating the addi
tional costs into cost savings in 
other areas so as to break even
and better utilize the time of the 
day.
Says Gurley, Clearly you have 
to examine the costs and the 
ramifications of having people 
working that third shift. Its not 
easy to recruit people that want 
to work those hours. If there is an 
illness ... it is more difficult to 
replace those people. Yet, there 
are many businesses that face 
those problems and its not that 
they are insurmountable, but they 
are factors.
We want to work with the 
students through surveys and the 
Student Dormitory Council Food 
Committee to really monitor the 
way the students view this.
The questions remain: How 
important is the demand for this 
late night service? Is it really more 
for just a coffeehouse atmosphere, 
and can maybe a cashier and one 
attendant handle it. If all you 
want is coffee and doughnuts,
thats fine; but its altogether dif
ferent than trying to staff a 
kitchen crew that does eggs, ba
con, and all those things. So we 
really want want to go forward 
with it, but we want to gather 
more information so we can meet 
demand and not just grope 
around.
The Tartan Grill 24-hour trial 
will start Sunday, December 10, 
and continue through Monday, 
December 18. We are holding 
the trial during finals because it 
is a situation where we know that 
people are up late. says Gurley. 
It is a good starting point so we 
can see if they come over when we 
know that theyre awake.
He said that if the service would 
be offered regularly, the possibil
ity of offering a contract meal 
period would be considered. 
However, he maintains, We cant 
do this just because its neat, well 
do it if it justifies being done.

The Registrars Office has de
veloped a new computer system, 
named the Student Information 
System, to meet the information 
needs and of Carnegie Mellon.
The current system, which in
volves the TOPS machines, will 
be removed in December. The 
transition is being done with a 
series of release dates. All pro
posed changes will be in effect by 
-July of1990.
One of the changes that will 
take place is the registration 
! process. Students will register for 
Spring 1990 in a similar way to 
'the past, but with four major 
changes. There will be five days of 
formal registration with registra
T
tion based upon class status. The 
Registration/Add/Drop form will 
be used with the elimination of 
the R-3D registration form. This 
creates a faster turnaround and 
a confirmation of registration 
before November 20.
Students will still need to go to 
each department for permission, 
said Dick Rainsberger, Univer
sity Registrar,but data will be 
processed right in the academic 
offices instead of going to the 
Registrars Office.
A goal projected for January of 
1991 is to exchange the registra
tion lines for a more convenient 
approach.
Darleen LaBarbera, director of 
enrollment systems, said, even
tually students will be able to go 
to a terminal or personal com
puter, look at their record of 
courses and requirements and 
register there.
Since his arrival at CMU in
1982, Rainsberger has been slowly 
working towards a new system. 
Carnegie Mellon as an institu
tion has grown more complex, he 
says. He has spoken with par
ents, students, alumni, and fac
ulty to identify the problems.
The addition of LaBarbera in 
19871edto more studies, conclud
ing that the technology of the 
1970s had been stretched as far 
as it could through the 80s.
TOPS machines were no longer 
supported. The software had run 
its course, and there was a need 
for new hardware, said 
Rainsberger.
The system wasnt drawing
information from a common data 
base, the information wasnt ac
cessible, and there was a lack of 
consistency, he concluded.
In the development of the new 
system, LaBarbera said, We 
have picked a conservative ap
proach to get us gracefully off the 
TOPS system.
The University has selected 
Ingres, a relational data base 
management system, which con
sists of a cluster of machines in
stead of a large main frame.
Different departments will have 
access to student information 
instead of going through the 
Registrars Office.
We want to utilize the advan
tages of CMUs system, electroni
cally, and go from there, says 
Rainsberger.

4The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  3 October 1989
Fraternities at odds over alcohol, risk management, enforcement issues
continued from page 1
the identifications of partygoers 
at its bar during its parties.
The chapter hopes these steps 
will lessen each brothers risk. If 
something is going to happen, we 
want it to happen to our chapter 
and to our national, not the indi
vidual brothers, said Mikol.
Other students feel that ATO 
has received pressure from its 
national organization to push for 
stricter controls on alcohol.
CFP President and Theta Xi 
brother Phil Antonson said on 
Thursday, As I understand, they 
[ATO] have received a lot of pres
sure from their national. Their 
national has threatened to notify 
the nationals of other CMU fra
ternities if the other chapters do 
not abide by the FIPG guidelines. 
If they have to abide by rules  
theyd like the others to do the 
same.
Mikol disputed that claim, say
ing, Our chapter has not been 
contacted by our national. Were 
doing these things because we 
feel they are important. I dont 
think theres a house on campus 
that doesnt serve underage 
people. Were supposed to be 
under the campus alcohol policy 
right now. We shouldve been 
Under it last year and the year 
before that.
 Iknowalreadythisyeartheres 
been a car accident; last year 
someone was hit and run; some
one else hit a tree this year. I feel
/U know it seems you cant picture in your mind a frater
nity world where no one under 21 is drinking, but if you 
dont do something on your own, its going to be forced 
upon you.
B Director of Greek Affairs Ron Campana
Were doing these things because we feel they are Im
portant. I dont think theres a house on campus that 
doesnt serve underage people. Were supposed to be 
under the campus alcohol policy right now. We shouldve 
been under it last year and the year before that.
B ATO President Brian Mikol
bad for the house its going to 
happen to first, but I dont think 
its going to stop there.
I think that most of the nation
als are looking to make some 
changes, and I dont think its out 
of line to say that over the next 
two to five years, most of the 
houses on this campus are sup
posed to be dry or BYOB or some
thing like that.
Campana contends that there 
has been pressure from most 
nationals represented at Carne
gie Mellon. He said at the meet
ing, Ive been contacted by about
95 percent of the nationals.... 
Some of them are going to take a 
very serious look at [fraternity] 
alcohol use.
I know it seems you cant pic
ture in your mind a fraternity 
world where no one under 21 is 
drinking, but if you dont do 
something on your own, its going 
to be forced upon you.
Other fraternities expressed 
interest in limiting CFPs role to 
that of a supporting group, rather 
than an enforcing one. Rather 
than committing CFP to taking 
action against houses violating
University policy or state law, 
they feel that the Council should 
provide guidance and leadership.
Goff presented a proposal to the 
Council that calls for the elimina
tion of alcohol from CFP-sponsored events, but differs from 
Mikols suggestions by calling on 
CFP to support, and not enforce, 
local, state, and federal alcohol 
laws.
Goff feels that enforcement is 
the wrong approach for two rea
sons. One, we cant enforce it; 
should we check each party? Two, 
we shouldnt; SAE, for example,
would resent another group tell
ing them what to do. Thats not to 
say we shouldnt be responsible.
Each house should be respon
sible. If you break the law, your 
fraternity is going down. But if 
we try to set some policy, if your 
fraternity does something wrong, 
youre going to pull the other 13 
down with it; thats too much of a 
risk for us to trust the other 13....
The Greek system has united 
over the past three years tremen
dously, but in no way would any 
person put the Greek system over 
his house. Something should be 
done, but the individual houses 
should take care of themselves.
Goff, however, does feel that 
progress has been made. The 
Greek system has changed con
siderably. Theres real and actual 
changes going on. It does come 
back to liability. Its not a matter 
of covering it up; its addressing 
the issues that have come up, 
said Goff.
Antonson agrees that CFP 
should not police the fraternities. 
I would not like to have CFP as 
an enforcing body, but as a sup
porting body.... We dont have the. 
capability to enforce at each house
24 hours a day,  he said.
Students in other fraternities 
have already come out against 
any enforcement role by CFP. 
Says Kappa Sigmas Mark Sklenar, We dont want a policy forced 
upon us.
The insurance crisis has forced
fraternity nationals to keep their 1 
chapters under tight supervision. 
A lot of fraternities are under 
FIPG, said Antonson. Under 
those policies, there are real guide
lines which each fraternity is 
supposed to follow. Currently, t 
were not doing it 100 percent, to 
say the least. Some chapters have 
felt some intense heat from the 
nationals aboutthose guidelines."
According to Campana, the 
University is willing to allow CFP 
to make its own decision. The 
University is interested in any 
attempt to go by the policies of the 
University and the State, he said. 
It would be easy for us to say, 
This is the law, and close our 
eyes.
Antonson concurred. Theyve 
given us a lot of autonomy, he 
said.
According to Antonson, any 
changes that come of out 
Thursdays meetings will take 
time to phase in, and may cost 
significant amounts of money.
Campana hints that Carnegie 
Mellon may aid the fraternities. 
If the fraternities are starting to 
do some serious riskmanagementj 
money will come from a variety of 
sources, he said. Whenyou serve 
alcohol, you take a tremendous 
risk. I think youre going to see 
the guys get a lot stricter and a lot 
tougher."

Tartan News Editor
Despite delays, east campus 
construction continues. Carnegie 
Mellon has set new target dates 
for completion of the various parts 
of the project.
; Construction on the east cam
pus began last June. Tech Field 
$nd the old intramural fields were 
razed to make way for the new 
garage, dormitory, and atheltic 
fields.
The new dormitory was origi
nally expected to be completed 
and occupied by this fall. In Feb
ruary, the Housing Office an
nounced that the building was 
Ipeing removed from the room 
draw process. Housing then said 
that hopefully at least one wing of 
the building would be ready for 
occupancy in January 1990, since 
the west wing was ahead of the 
ast wing by one month.
; Near the beginning of this 
emester, however, Housing 
announced that neither building 
would be occupied until fall 1990. 
To date, much of the exterior work 
in the two dormitory wings has 
been completed.
; Emphasis is now beginning to 
hift toward completing the in
stallation of the windows and

beginning work on the walls, ele
vators, and plumbing of the 
buildings interior.
The parking garage was ini
tially expected for occupancy by 
fall 1989, with the athletic and 
intramural fields slated for com
pletion in fall 1990.
The parking garage has been 
opened for partial occupancy for 
about 360 vehicles in locations 
within the garage that vary as 
construction continues.
The new dormitory, the wings
of which have tentatively been 
named Resnik Hall (west) and 
Tech Hall (east), pending the 
approval of the Board of Trustees 
in November, is a six-story, $19 
million dollar building that will 
house 304 students.
Most students will live in the 53 
suites that will house three to 
eight residents each, with single 
or double bedrooms sharing com
mon living rooms and baths. Other 
students will live in 10 single or 
double bedrooms with adjoining
bathrooms.
Resnik and Tech appear as two 
independent structures. Each 
wing will have separate lobby 
areas and elevators, and the two 
wings will be connected by an 
underground passageway.
Resnik will house a first-floor 
computer cluster, as well as other 
areas to be used for special events. 
The basement of Tech Hall will 
contain varsity locker and train
ing rooms, and will be connected 
to the playing field by an under
ground passage. Tech will also 
house the new dining hall, which 
will seat 400 students in three 
dining areas.
The new parking garage is esti
mated to cost the University $6 
million to complete. The struc
ture will eventually hold 625 ve
hicles on three levels, including 
140 metered spaces on the 
garages first floor.
The new $4.8 million athletic 
field will lay between the two 
dormitory wings and the garage, 
with the bleachers and press box 
annexed to the garage. The bleach
ers will seat 3500 people. The 
surface of the playing field will be 
artificial turf, and the track will 
also be made of synthetic materi
als.
Finally, the East Campus Proj
ect includes two new intramural 
fields with natural surface to be 
included on the east side of the 
dormitory and parking garage.
The East Campus Project is the 
first step towards achieving the 
ultimate goal for the campus as
Resnik and Tech appear as two inde
pendent structures. Each wing will 
have separate lobby areas and eleva
tors, and the two wings will be con
nected by an underground passage
way .... Tech will also house the new 
dining hall.
laid out by the University Master 
Plan.
The plan was developed by the 
Boston architecture firm Dennis, 
Clark & Associates. The firm 
submitted the plan in a competi
tion sponsored by the University 
that was intended to develop the 
best plan for the campus.
This is the second such compe
tition sponsored by the Univer
sity; in 1904, the New York firm 
Palmer and Hombostel won a 
comptetion with the design of the 
Universitys first six buildings, 
which were constructed at a cost 
of $6 million.
The centerpiece of Carnegie 
Mellons Master Plan is the Uni
versity Center  a building that 
could include a ballroom, audito
rium, gymnasiums, a swimming 
pool, racquetball courts, meeting 
rooms, bookstore, food store, post 
office, bank, food court, and stu
dent activities space.
Other features of the plan in
clude a performing arts building, 
a restoration of the Cut to the 
natural ravine that was originally 
there, and various academic build
ings, like the planned addition to, 
GSIA.
Plans for the University Center t 
and the East Campus Project; 
incorporate a design reminiscent! 
of Hombostels original architec
tural design for the campus. The 
exterior of the new dormitory and 
of the parking garage will re^ _ 
semble that of Margaret Morri
son Carnegie Hall.

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  3 October 1989
Senate urges CIT to offer basic courses for non-engineering majors
Senators present: Berger,
Bohlman, Bromberg, Brown, 
Conard, Deshmukh, DiVito, 
Gaertner, Lenga , Moura, Neigh
bor, OKeefe, Pinto, Ruben, 
Spivack, Stepanek, Warner, 
Witbrock, Wyatt.
Senators excused: Brockmann, Erdner, Kaufman, Steppel.
Senators absent: Atwater, 
Radzanowski, Rapier.
Ex-Officios present: Dean 
Cox, Davidson, Franco, Fraser.
Audience Participation: A 
student concerned with the de
struction of Hurricane Hugo 
asked Senate for an official en
dorsement to establish a relief 
drive for victims of the storm. 
This official endorcement was 
given on a voice vote.
An former student of Carnegie 
Mellon who currently is attend
ing Chatam College came before 
Senate to express her concern with 
sexism on the Carnegie Mellon 
campus as evidenced in an col
umn in The Tartan of Sept. 19 
entitled An Attic for CMUs 
Toys.
She asked specifically how the 
problem of gender relations can 
be dealt with, and what can be 
done in the future concerning such 
articles and the general lack of 
understanding of the very real 
problem.
It was suggested that this be 
brought up in the Senate Execu
tive Committee and also in the 
external Diversity Committee 
formed by the Student Govern
ment President Mark Mittelhauser.
Also representatives of The Tar
tan made it clear that while the 
column is run every week in the 
forum section of The Tartan, it is 
in no way an expression of the 
Editorial Board of The Tartan or
the staff of The Tartan.
Special Business: Special 
Allocation for the Carnegie Care 
Unit: The Carnegie Care Unit will 
be coordinating a symposium on 
chemical and substance abuse, 
on October 3rd. Incoming speak
ers will be from Mercy Hospital.
A special allocation of $540 will 
be needed to cover honoraria for 
speakers ($300), and advertizement in The Tartan ($240). A 
representative of the Carnegie 
Care Unit explained the need; the 
motion passed on voice vote.
Non-Funded Recognition for the 
Carnegie Mellon Objectivist Club: 
President Eric Shrader talked 
about the club which was formed 
to study the philosophy of objec
tivism. The motion passed on a 
voice vote.
Non-Funded Recognition for the 
LDS StudentsAssocitation: Chair 
Pete Ashcroft attended the meet
ing to answer any questions. The 
purpose of the club is to promote 
friendships and fellowship among 
the community of students, staff 
and faculty associated with the 
Church of Jesus Christ of LatterDay Saints. The motion passed 
on a voice vote.
Non-Funded Recognition for the 
CMU Big Brothers/Big Sisters 
Program: The purpose of this club 
is to work in coordination with 
the Big Brothers of the Greater 
Pittsburgh Area. Students in this 
club are to befriend children of 
broken homes of 6 to 14 years and 
meet on a regular basis with these 
children to promote friendship 
and a sense of family and commu
nity. There was a question raised 
about the association of this CMU 
Big Brothers/Sisters with the na
tional organization of Big Broth
ers/Sisters, and the local Pitts
burgh branch of that organiza
tion. The question was raised
whether these organizations dis
criminate on the basis of sexual 
preference. Since no representa
tive of this club was available to 
answer these questions, the mo
tion was tabled until next week so 
that a representative of this club 
can answer these questions.
Non-Funded Recognition for the 
CMU Dungeons & Dragons Club: 
Bill Corley of this club was avail
able to answer questions concern
ing this organization. The pur
pose is to play campaigns of 
Dungeons & Dragons.
To reserve rooms, groups need 
to be recognized. The motion 
passed on voice vote.
Activities Board: A question 
was raised on how to get in touch 
with AB. The phone number to 
the main office, Skibo 200, is 
x2105.
Faculty Senate: Dr. Davidson 
of Civil Engineering announced 
that in the future there will be a 
represenative of the Faculty 
Senate attending Student Senate 
meetings.
Also all senators are invited to 
attend the Student Affairs Com
mittee of Faculty Senate. Contact 
Dr. Walker of the Math Depart
ment for meeting times.
Student Affairs: Dean Cox 
announced that the conference 
on Alcohol Abuse on University 
Campuses, to be held Thursday, 
Nov. 27, has been moved from 
Doherty Hall to the Skibo Ball
room.
Dean Cox also cleared up an 
error in The Tartan article about 
the Counseling Center. Tutoring 
is available through the 
Counceling Center every SundayThursday in Wean Hall. How
ever, individual tutoring is not 
readily available for all students.
Student represenatives on the 
Board of Trustee Committees are:
Alumni Affairs, Nina Pinto; Build
ing and Grounds, Fred Hilde
brand and Jon Bohlman; Devel
opment and Planning, Matt 
Ruben and Aru Deshmukh; Edu
cational Affairs, Lisa Melenyzer 
and Terence Yarde; Enrollment, 
Bryan Wong; Research, Matt 
Fraser and Pete Gaertner.
Academic Affairs - Matthew 
Ruben: Ruben brought up the 
fact that while students from all 
colleges take courses in CFA, MCS 
and H&SS, very few non-CIT stu
dents take courses from that col
lege. To this end the Academic Af
fairs Committee has talked to 
Dean Kail of CIT concerning the 
feasibility of a basic course in 
circuits or acoustics or structures.
Dean Kail says its on the 
agenda, but that a Senate resolu
tion would help promote the idea. 
To that end the resolution on 
Appendix I was passed on a voice 
vote. Also, the Academic Affairs 
committee is still looking into the 
feasibility of a human relations 
course.
Campus Affairs - Roy Conard:
A bike rack proposal should be 
ready by next week for the whole 
of Senate. A question was raised 
concerning the idea that students 
cannot buy permits in the new 
parking garage.
Dean Murphy clarified that it 
was necessary to limit access to 
the new garage to employees for 
the permits for the building of the 
garage. However, this will not 
affect the current allcoation of 
parking permits.
Hopefully the garage will be 
used by more faculty and staff, 
while other lots such as Morewood and Doherty will have more 
places for students. The current 
allocation proceeds from faculy 
first, to staff, graduated students, 
and lastly undergrads.
Funding and Recognition - 
Nicole Brockmann: Budget 
proposals for fall funding are due 
on Friday, Sept. 30.
Rules: At the last Rules meet
ing, the committee voted support
ing the Executive Committee idea 
that all seniority is lost once a 
Senator gives up his/her seat for
any reason.
Points of Discussion:Theques-10 
tion of what can be done about the*3 
bookstore was raised.
The question specifically asked g 
how more books on academic^ 
subjects outside of required text, 
books can be obtained. The best" 
avenue is through the Retail' 
Stores Committee under Mark. 
Mittelhauser. The chair of that" 
committee is Marc Roston.
Appendix I: Student Senate 
Resolution Number 1, Fall 1989.,,
Whereas, the goal of an underT(1 
graduate university program is, 
to make avaliable as many types'" 
of knowledge as possible;
Whereas, H&SS, MCS, and" 
CFA currently have courses fre

By RHONDA STRUMINGER
Tartan Staffwriter
Student Senate will make a 
proposal to the University in an 
attempt to solve the problem of 
insufficient bicycle racks at popu
lar locations.
The problem came to Senates 
attention in the fall of1987 when 
then-senator Audrey Liu, an 
architecture major and member 
of Senates Campus Affairs com
mittee, realized the need to im
prove the number, location, and 
design of bicycle racks on cam
pus. Senate is now taking the fi
nal steps toward a solution.
I According to Campus Affairs 
Committee Chair Roy Conard, the 
bicycle rack issue has been one of 
the major topics of concern for 
Senates Campus Affairs Commit
tee this year.
In order to determine the best
solutions to the present 
problem, Conard has in
vestigated where overflows 
of bicycles exist and where 
bikes are illegally parked, 
such as inside buildings.
He has also contacted 
manufacturers to check on 
different costs and styles 
of bicycle racks. Racks of 
the continuous pipe style, 
like the ones in front of the 
University Computing 
Center, will most likely re
place the older racks.
Once all aspects of the project 
have been fully explored, Conard, 
along with the president of Stu
dent Government, Mark Mittelhauser, who is also a past chair of 
the Campus Affairs committee, 
will put together the proposal. 
This proposal, according to Con
ard, will be on the desk of the 
Vice President for Business Afnxr ccUdese xA campPe
fairs, Fred Rogers, by this week. 
Conard went on to say that hed 
like to see more capacity and 
more convenience in bike racks so 
that more people can feel that 
they can ride bikes to school and 
park them conveniently. Since 
most people live within a close 
radius of the University, I hope 
that it will be a good way to cut 
down on car traffic as well as to
help with the parking situation. 
It is also a good way to get exer
cise and to cut down on carbon 
monoxide pollution.
Further, Mittelhauser said, 
There is an urgent need on 
campus for action to be taken on 
bike racks as an issue. The ad
ministration is ready to act and 
its a matter of producing interest 
in a proposal.

University Architect Paul Tell
ers cites the construction cost for 
the three phases at $4.25 million.
According to Tellers, the major 
portion of the Margaret Morrison 
building was designed by Henry 
Hornbostel and constructed in 
1907. Six years later, a wing was

Robotics at NASA, told the sub
committee of the many uses of the 
technology in space travel.
The second discussion looked 
at the use of robotics in human 
services. Speaking to the subcom
mittee, K.G. Engelhardt, director 
of the Center for Human Service 
Robots at Mellon Institute, 
pointed out that the uses of robots 
in service areas are unique in 
that they are designed to aug
ment, not replace, humans, and 
thatservice robotics work in close 
proximity to, not divorced from, 
their human teammates.
The other two speakers on the 
panel, Dr. Terrence Carroll, vice 
president for Support Services at 
Magee-Womens Hospital in Pitts
burgh, and Don Goughler, CEO of 
Southwestern Pennsylvania Hu
man Services, spoke of develop
ments in the use of service robot
ics for helping in the care of the ill 
?nd the physically disabled.
The final discussion dealt with 
the development of new manufac
turing technology in robotics. 
CMU Mechanical Engineering 
Professor Friedrich Prinz at
tempted to explain why the U.S. 
is falling behind Japan and other 
countries technically. Dr. John 
Simpson, director of the Center 
for Manufacturing Engineering 
at the National Institute of Stan
dards and Technology, offered pos
sible alternatives for the U.S. to 
take to remain competitive in 
manufacturing fields.
Members of each panel re
quested realignment of govern
ment aid. Whittaker pointed out 
that aid for robotics development 
is given in a piecemeal fashion. 
There is a need for a national 
agenda, carried out by govern
ment, universities, and industry, 
he said. Simpson took a similar 
stand, asking for full-hearted 
dedication from the government 
and American industry.
Lack of funding is a serious 
.problem for service robotics, ac
cording to Engelhardt. She said 
funding in this area has been con
centrated in the Department of 
Defense and aerospace research.
The same robotics technologies 
that can serve a physically re
stricted astronaut in space can 
also serve a physically limited 
person, she said.
was made on the north end.
Because Margaret Morrison is 
located in a valley running 
through Carnegie Mellons cam
pus, the land had to be filled in 
order to construct the front por
tion of the building.
As a result of the unanticipated 
expenses for the projects second 
phase, it has been postponed in
definitely. Tellers is quick to point 
out, however, that this does not
mean it will never take place.
Consultants for the University 
are examining the plans for the 
addition to see what changes can 
be made. Those beinginvestigated 
involve less costly methods of 
building the site walls, eliminat
ing the propsed connecting bridge 
on the roof, and using brick in
stead of precast concrete.
Tellers also mentioned that 
plans for a chiller facility may
propel the Margaret Morrison 
project along. This proposed 
chiller facility would cool the 
University Center, GSIA addition, 
Margaret Morrison, and Tech and 
Resnik Halls.
The most economical location 
for the proposed facility woyld be 
under the proposed addition to 
MargaretMorrison. The construc
tion of the chiller facility is tar
geted for fall 1992.

Carnegie Mellon will soon 
begin to study the implem
entation of safety-related 
regulation for bicycling on 
campus. Current policy re
garding bicycles on campus 
is restricted to only parking 
and storage. No safety-related policies currently ex
ist, but reasonable limitations 
have to be set, according to Car
negie Mellon Police Chief James 
LaPaglia.
During the first few weeks of 
this semester, several accidents 
involving bicycles and pedestri
ans have raised safety concerns 
about the operation of bicycles on 
campus.
On September 16, a 73-year-old 
man suffered injured ribs when 
he was struck by a bicycle rider on 
the Cut who had lost control of his 
bicycle.
Five days later, a bicyclist 
swerved to avoid a jogger and hit 
a water main. The bicyclist flipped 
over the bikes handlebars and 
received injuries to his neck and 
shoulder.
According to LaPaglia, a lot of 
things can be done, depending on 
how strict you want to be. La
Paglia plans in the near future to 
appoint an individual to look into
possible solutions for the prob
lem.
Other universities will be con
tacted to see if they are encoun
tering the same kinds of prob
lems and to see what kinds of 
solutions theyve implemented' 
and how effective those solutions 
are.
LaPaglia said that certain regu
lations need to be created and 
enforced. These regulations in
clude granting right of way to the 
pedestrian and banning bicycle 
riding in buildings.
Other possibilities for regula
tion include banning bicycles al
togetherwhich LaPaglia thinks 
is a bit extreme  as well as 
creating and enforcing a speed 
limit for bicycles on campus.
There are alotof possibilities, 
LaPaglia said. Next week, the 
matter will be discussed at a; 
committee meeting.
While the issue of problems with, 
bicycling and safety are being 
considered, LaPaglia saidthat he 
had no knowledge of any safety Or' 
traffic related problems with' 
skateboarding on campus.
LaPaglia said he felt that the 
bicycle problem has been ignored 
for so long because it has always 
been pushed to the back burner so 
that the department could con
centrate on problems with prob
lems like alcohol.

Adapt or die, says Darwins pledging nationwide. Fraternities
theory of natural selection.
The Council of Fraternity Presi
dents will meet Thursday to at
tempt to lower the collective Greek 
risk from liability suits. The fra
ternities need to adopt coherent, 
responsible policies regarding 
alcohol-related problems.
Alcohol laws have gotten stiffer. 
Because of underage drinking, 
insurance is harder to get. Frater
nity nationals are cracking down 
and houses are losing their char
ters nationwide. Local chapters 
need to respond to these issues 
rather than dodging them.
' If, in the face of stricter alcohol 
laws, fraternities are willing to 
condone or at least overlook the 
pressing issue of underage drink
ing, they accept the consequence 
of jeopardizing their organiza
tions. As horrible as this may 
sound, perhaps the elimination of 
underage drinking at fraternities 
is the only alternative as college 
life moves into the 90s. First safe 
sex  now safe partying.
Weve already seen conse
quences of the risks of underage 
drinking here. Nearly 150 stu
dents were arrested here two years 
ago for underage drinking. In 
addition, Tau Kappa Epsilon and 
Zeta Beta Tau have eliminated
have been eliminated altogether 
at Franklin and Marshall College.
Currently, CFP is faced with a 
proposal that asks each house to 
police itself. There is some discus
sion about the idea, however, 
because Alpha Tau Omega has 
brought up a similar idea that 
calls for CFP to enforce all the 
houses.
Basically, the fraternities agree 
they must control their risk and 
party safely. Most houses, it 
seems, do not want to trust other 
fraternities to uphold the rules, 
nor do they want CFP looking 
over their shoulders. They fear 
that by making CFP enforce alco
hol rules, a violation by one house 
will inflict repercussions among 
others. Giving CFP a mandate to 
enforce, they say, makes the en
tire system liable for one houses 
mistake.
We agree, but with a catch. Its 
time for each house  and each 
individual memberto face up to 
the fact that free-flowing beer for 
everyone isnt the way to have a 
good time in the 1990s. The days 
of Animal House are over. More 
responsibility falls on the frater
nities to uphold stricter laws and 
to provide for personal safety.
Its time to adapt  or die.

What rhymes with AB and 
SDC, eats activities fees, makes 
everybody happy, but sounds bad?
The word is movie, and for 
most students its the only time 
they see their money in action. 
True, AB and SDC sponsor other 
events, such as dances, concerts, 
coffeehouses, and Carnival events, 
but students evenings and dol
lars are dedicated to the weekend 
film showings.
So if these films are important 
to AB and SDC (and they are), and 
if the campus community takes a 
great deal of enjoyment from them 
(and we do), then why cant we 
hear the damned things?
Two years ago, a new sound sys
tem was installed in DH2210. It 
was going to eliminate the persis
tent hums, buzzes, and patches of 
silence that plagued the weekend 
films. Any student will tell you 
that it doesnt work. The single in
stalled speaker is inadequate for 
the rooms size and acoustics, and 
the projectors are incessantly 
jumping on the audio track. Its ir
ritating, and considering the 
amount of student money that
supports the film programs, its 
unacceptable.
There are several options for re
working the sound system in 
DH2210, including the possible 
expansion of the projection booth 
into a full-fledged 35mm setup 
with two projectors or a more 
compact platter system.
The 35mm option, while bring
ing the visual quality of the films 
up to levels in commercial thea
ters, would bring the benefits of 
full stereo sound. Also, any im
provement to the lecture halls 
sound can help the professors who 
teach, shout, and yell there.
With the construction of the 
University Center and its hypo
thetical theater a distant smudge 
on the development horizon, we 
at The Tartan would like AB and 
SDC to take the long-range view 
on DH2210. Assuming that films 
will be shown in the lecture hall 
into the foreseeable future, Stu
dent Activities should spend the 
money to do it right, not just to fix 
it for a few months.
Doing so would be a sound in
vestment.

There has been much discussion over 
the circumstances surrounding the 
murder of David Piergalski and the is
sues this tragedy raises. However, ar
ticles, editorials and letters in the media 
and comments on local talk shows sug
gest that these issues remain unclear to 
the press and the general public. This 
letter is an attempt to express concretely 
what these issues are and to separate 
them from irrelevant ones.
It seems clear David Piergalski was 
murdered because he was gay. This being 
the case, the specific issue at hand is the 
violence directed at gay people just be
cause we are gay. While we sympathize 
with the personal loss to his family and 
friends, this murder is profoundly dis
turbing to lesbians and gays generally 
because of the evident motivation of his 
killers. The victim didnt have to be David 
Piergalski; any gay person would have 
fit the criteria for the murderers. That 
such violence can occur, and that it does 
with alarming frequency, is a clear threat 
to the security of lesbian and gay citi
zens in the area. It has in every way the
effect upon us as similar racially moti
vated violence would have on a targeted 
racial minority. So the first issue is the 
problem of violence, sometimes to the 
point of murder, against lesbian and gay 
people.
A second issue is the problem of les
bian and gay people not reporting to the 
police assaults prompted by the 
assailants fear or hatred of lesbians and 
gays. There are a number of reasons for 
this. One is indifference or even hostility 
on the part of many members of the 
police force towards lesbian and gay 
people. This hostility has manifested 
itself on numerous occasions, and cer
tainly discourages some lesbian and gay 
people from reporting these incidents.
Another reason is the persons fear of 
being fired or evicted if his or her em
ployer or landlord discovers the 
individuals sexual orientation via news 
reports, public records, or rumor. This is 
a legitimate fear since we know that 
such firings and evictions occur in this 
region, and we have no legal recourse 
against these actions. Protection from 
such arbitrary discrimination in these
areas could lead to better reporting of 
such crimes.
While there has been much discussion 
about sexual activity occurring in Schenley Park and around Dithridge Street, 
the impropriety of such activity is not' 
relevant to either this case specifically or 
to lesbian and gay issues in general' 
Rather, it is a smoke screen to hide the 
general issue of violence against lesbian 
and gay people, and the specific issue of 
Mr. Piergalskis murder. It has also been 
a vehicle to assert prejudiced opinions 
against lesbians and gays through un
substantiated suggestions that such 
behavior is typical for and exclusive to 
the gay community and verges on justi
fying violence against lesbian and gay 
people. It is also well known that heterosexuals engage in similar behavior within 
the city limits. Attempts to portray such' 
activity as a gay activity are false and 
unscrupulously misleading.
Most notably, however, this false issue 
of appropriate sexual behavior has been 
used to practically justify the murder of 
David Piergalski. It seems intuitively

We, the women of Chatham College, 
have lived with many stigmas and mis
conceptions for some time. Womens col
leges are typically viewed as dens for 
ardent feminists and lesbians or as fin
ishing schools for rich girls seeking their 
MRS. degrees. Even Mayor Sophie 
Masloff, in an address to the Chatham 
student body last spring, referred to us 
as princesses." Recently, Stew Levine, 
Copy Editor of The Tartan, stated in his 
satiric column that because of the space 
problem Carnegie Mellon should pur
chase Chatham since it is not much of a 
school anyway. This column, as well as 
the general ignorance of the merits of a 
womens college, have incited our stu
dent body to call for a fair and realistic 
representation of our institution.
First, we would like to introduce you to 
the Chatham Student Body. Our popula
tion is 85% White, 14% Black, 2% Asian, 
and 2% Hispanic. The Gateway program 
at Chatham enables women who have 
been out of high school for at least seven 
years to complete their degree program. 
The number of Gateway students at 
Chatham is steadily increasing and now 
stands at 40%. More than 80% of 
Chathams students receive financial aid. 
Obviously, we are not all young, spoiled, 
rich girls and we represent many races, 
religions, and political affiliations.
Chatham as a womens liberal arts 
college, may often be viewed as inferior 
to some, more technical institutions. 
However, womens colleges have edu
cated almost half the women legislators 
in congress and approximately the same 
percentage of women board members of 
Fortune 1000 companies. Womens col
leges produce more than twice as many 
female medical school entrants as coedu
cational institutions. The Carnegie Foun
dation includes Chatham College along 
with Washington and Jefferson College 
and Allegheny College as the only highly 
selective liberal arts institutions in the 
western Pennsylvania and Ohio area.
At Chatham, the average class size is 
eleven and we are known by our names, 
not our numbers. Ninety-five percent of 
our faculty hold Ph.D or equivalent de
grees and 50% are women. We are never 
instructed by teaching assistants in lieu 
of professors and teaching is the first 
priority at Chatham in contrast to priori
ties of personal publication and inde
pendent research.
In addition to producing educated, 
successful, well-rounded women, 
Chatham has other merits. We support 
one another as women and have many 
alumnae, faculty, and fellow students as 
role models. We are free to take leader
ship roles that, in coeducational institu
tions, are traditionally dominated by
men. We are not as influenced by sextyped role behavior in the classroom and 
we feel free to interact with our instruc
tors. This unique environment of shar
ing and learning is conducive to both 
emotional and intellectual growth.
Finally, yes, traditional-aged students 
do visit other universities to meet mal6 
and female peers. However, Chatham 
women cross-register at several institu
tions and utilize their library resources 
for purely academic purposes. Most of us 
really do like and love men. Most of us 
did not choose Chatham because it is 
single-sex but we stay here, among other 
reasons, because we have come to realize 
the advantages of this environment.
We know that Chatham has its flawS, 
as do all academic institutions, but such 
are the compromises one must make for 
the excellent quality of education that 
we receive. We graduate with not only 
substantial knowledge in our majors but 
also with practical knowledge in several 
other disciplines. We are proud to be 
attending Chatham, an institution wherte 
the students come first.

"--by?
GunsnRoses.
Pop Quiz: What do the furor 
,"'ri>ver the Mapplethorpe exhibit 
.'"fcnd the controversy over flag
- - burning have in common?
Ill tell you.
Theyre both part of the same
 ^conservative mind-set, an attitude 
'by which anything different or 
. "'alarming is automatically bad/ 
.dnti-American (by a very narrow 
..^"definition of what is American) 
. - and should be purged, lest it dirty 
..".-'American purity.
The problem with Mapple
thorpe and burning the flag cen"ters around the use of symbols. 
"'Conservatives have always been 
/' Very big on symbols, because they 
;,*6re large, clear targets that take 
"little accommodation or thought 
.' "with which to deal.
The flag represents America 
-'=the Great or the America of the 
jM' Eisenhower era, when all the 
. .-^'Problems were whitewashed 
^"'tinder a sheen of Happy Days 
. "-reruns and sock-hops. America 
.. ;4he Great was America the Pow.r^erful. We could force our will on 
-'^anyone we wished; when conserDon Pickett
vatives and liberals alike could 
believe that our way was the best, 
and no one could stop us.
Blind worship of the flag allows 
you to forget about reality, about 
the homeless, the deficit, the 
environment, drugs. Stare at the 
flag, recite the list of great accom
plishments to yourself, pump up 
on patriotic fervor, and charge 
into the world with the blind beliefthat any problem can be solved 
just by throwing money at it and 
believing. This is enormously 
comforting, dangerous, and abso
lutely false.
To these people, the symbol has 
become the real. Listen to Jesse 
Helms or Orin Hatch, and you 
will believe that the Communists 
are working actively to overthrow 
the government, that anyone who 
gets in the way of big business is 
working to destroy the country, 
and that anyone who has an opin
ion differing from that narrow
minded, hidebound, misanthropic 
definition of America should be 
shot.
To these people, the realities of 
America are too much. The mere 
idea that we may not be on top,
that other nations in the world 
are capable of being competitive 
with us on any level is amazing. 
Hasnt history shown that Amer
ica is the best, that we are the 
only country capable of forcing 
back the communist menace, that 
without us the free world would 
be in Red Slavery?
No. History has shown us, in 
the last 45 years (to most conser
vatives, the only history worth 
remembering) that, when follow
ing the most destructive war the 
planet has ever known, a power 
vacuum develops. A country 
geared up from a major world war 
can move in and, using vast mate
rial and financial forces, construct 
a world around its fears and ob
jectives. It can manipulate that 
world for its own purposes for 40 
years. But when that country has 
problems  a declining work 
ethic, a drug problem, poorly 
managed government, a deficit, 
flaring racism  it leaves the 
door open for other countries that 
are geared up to fight the battles 
of the 21st century, not recount
ing the battles of the 20th.
Conservatives cant accept the 
fact that what has worked for 40 
years just might not work now, 
and that the old values, so cher
ished, must give way to new ones,
lest the protectors of the old val
ues perish. Darwin stated that 
only the fittest survive, only those 
who are best adapted for the 
environment will remain to re
produce.
When a country is ruled by a 
faction that can only look back
wards, that believes that the ap
plications of symbolic help can 
solve any problems, and that there 
are no problems in this country, 
then we can only go backwards.
When people are afraid to admit 
that some problems might not 
have easy solutions, might require 
hardship and original thinking, 
then, boys and girls, we are well 
and truly screwed.
Government should lead the 
country, not bow down to PACs 
and special interest groups. The 
NRA can almost block laws ban
ning the importation of weapons 
whose purpose is death on a mass 
scale, and say that they are de
fending the constitution, the flag.
Wake up, look around, and be 
scaredyoushouldbe. Butdont 
sit complaining that we cant solve 
the problems. Weve been doing 
that for decades, and look where

The United States and UN must act to stop Syrian aggression in Lebanon
pushed the Syrians back. But it is independent Lebanon.  Jeaner What do Syria and Lebanon 
^c'rhave in common? Well, Syrias 
undaunted assault upon Lebanon, 
namely Christian West Beirut, 
under President Gen. Michel 
^Aoun, is increasing and is being 
condemned by absolutely no one.
For the past decade, Syria (with 
strong Soviet influence) has been 
devastating Lebanese cities and 
'their inhabitants. Artillery bar
rages are common and are tum.,-^'ing to rubble what was once the 
;r'' Monte Carlo of the Middle East. 
^"The following is taken from a 
,y'Column by Jeane Kirkpatrick: 
"-Syria's occupation of Lebanon is 
6- '"A clear cut case of aggression....It 
, t: Jias already reduced the number 
~of Beirut inhabitants from 1.25 
t Jo .million to (roughly) 200,000. 
w With astonishing statistics such 
" *as these, one would expect at least 
condemnation of Syria. But is 
n there any mention at all? Has the 
i 4?'UN denounced Syria? Obviously 
not to an effective degree. There 
.  hasn't been any open condemnar^ition of Syria, and its militant
-  * subservients in Beirut. Mind you, 
'ttfie Soviets, and their Arab allies 
-*'have a firm grip on the UN, so 
3Syrias actions may continue to
Dave Schwartz
fall to deaf ears. Something is 
definitely wrong.
What about the U.S.? Is there a 
staunch attack on Syria for its 
acts of aggression? The U.S. State 
Department has issued letters of 
condemnation. Aside from their 
bombastic tone, these letters have 
done nothing. Why this is so must 
be asked of President Bush and 
the liberal majority in the legisla
tive branch of our government.
Instead, Democrats and their 
liberal ilk are condemning Israel 
for the apprehension of Shiek 
Obaid, a known terrorist respon
sible for the death of Colonel Hig
gins! A veritable and sad joke.
Speaking on international 
fronts, however, is there a sem
blance of gutsy action! Well, it 
appears as if someone does have 
the courage to stand tall, so with 
that, I must commend Frances 
bravery on sending a fleet of 
warships to Beirut to challenge 
the Syrian threat. Unfortunately 
though, when all is said and done, 
this action has not effectively
a step in right direction.
With that, I would like to make 
an assumption. If France were to 
engage the Syrians in combat 
(rather than having idle shows of 
force), there would be a condemna
tion by the Soviets similar to what 
occurred in Suez Crisis, involving 
the British and Israelis. Isnt it 
funny though that the Syrians, or 
as in the case of the Suez Crisis, 
the Egyptians, can do as they 
please (i.e., invade Lebanon or 
seize the canal)? When a retali
ation is made, however, the Sovi
ets are quick to condemn. HY
POCRISY ALERT!
Will there be peace in Lebanon? 
The answer rests in the hands of 
the world community. If the ma
jor powers were to forcefully bring 
the warring factions to the bar
gaining table, the fighting might 
stop. The soviets have too much 
at stake so the fighting wont stop. 
The Middle East has been a hot
spot ever since the birth of Islam, 
but as I said, there are deeply en
trenched political ideals coming 
from, you guessed it, Moscow. 
There will be no peace in the 
Middle East until there is an
Kirkpatrick.
As a final note, since this is the 
50th anniversary of the begin
ning of WWII (September 1939), 
here is a lesson:
The only thing necessary for 
the triumph of evil is for good men 
to do nothingEdmund Burke.

Why do I sit around in class 
instead of taking notes? Why 
are my notes on every inch of 
the paper and not on the lines? 
Why do I have a notebook containingmostly drawings instead 
of notes (and I am not a doodler)? Ill tell you why  its 
because I have notetakers, and 
believe me, they are damn good.
I sit around in class because I 
have nothing better to do. Ihave 
too much trouble trying to take 
my own notes, because I am 
very likely to miss something, 
given the extent of my hearing 
loss. I am so glad some people 
actually want to pay attention 
for me.
My notes are on every inch of 
the paper because the bookstore 
does not stock lined notetaking 
paper (its not your regular car
bon paperthis is real special 
stuff).
It is very time-consuming to 
draw lines on paper, given the 
fact that I have six classes as 
well as a job. Would you believe 
they even raised the price of 
this unlined paper by 35 cents? 
First my phone bill, now this. I 
think it would be very nice if the 
bookstore could supply some 
lined paper before I graduate. 
There are other hearing im
paired students who have 
notetakers, too, so I know Im 
not alone in my quest for inex
pensive, lined notetaking pa
per.
I have one notebook with some
very interesting notes and 
drawings in it. The notetaker 
from that class is an architec
ture major, and needs to ex
press his creativity. Messages 
such as Hi Sue! Holy Boredom 
today! really lift my spirits. 
No kidding  when you live 
the crazy kind of life I do, any  
thing can make it better.
My notetakers are my keys to 
sanity and success. Without 
them, I would not be able to 
survive in any of my classes. 
They take time out to see if I 
can decipher their handwrit
ing. They take time out to see if 
I understand their sometimes 
complicated notes which are 
hidden amidst an array of ar
rows. They take time out to see 
if I start nodding off, and then 
give me a shove if the results 
are positive. In short, they 
watch out for me.
But our relationships are not 
confined to the classroom. One 
of my notetakers, who lives offcampus, has a job. I often sit 
and talk with her when she is 
working. We talk about what 
happened to us after classes, 
we complain about the papers 
we have to write, we dream on 
about guys. Suffice it to say 
that we are good friends.
They say that good help is 
hard to find. Well, bless my 
notetakers, for they all offered 
to help me before I even asked 
them. My notetakers, my 
friendswhat would I ever do 
without them?

was not making a direct compari
son between Anna Balletbos lec
ture andA Clockwork Orange (as 
David Ng seems to think I was 
trying to do, hence his parody of 
my article). I saw the irony of 
juxtaposing the two events and 
pointed that irony out. That irony 
again: we want to enlighten men 
to the virtues of social work in 
order to move toward an equal 
society, and meanwhile, men are
being entertained by scenes of 
the debasement of women. I know 
the main point of the movie was 
not to degrade women, but it is 
possible to be moved to speak 
about certain aspects of a film 
and audience reactions to these 
certain aspects. Im not interested 
in a victory over men; Id be 
pleased with things on equal 
terms, like most women. Yet with 
the attitudes displayed by male 
audience members viewing A 
Clockwork Orange, equal status 
seems close to impossible unless

Thank you for including infor
mation about our new student 
grant program and Directory of 
Undergraduate Opportunities for 
Research and Creative Projects 
in The Tartan. We are particu
larly pleased that so many fac
ulty members have volunteered 
to work with students on existing 
and student-initiated work. We 
are delighted with the student 
response so far.
Since the October 20th dead
line for the very first student 
grants is approaching, we wanted 
to let your readers know we are
eager to hear their ideas. A stu
dent grant can be used in many 
ways, for example, to buy materi
als or equipment or to travel. 
Students can also use grants for 
student employment or to apply 
workstudy stipends to creative, 
artistic work or research work.
We are ready to help students 
develop proposals.

In response to Stew Levines 
opinion column in the September 
19 issue [CMU needs a bigger 
attic for its toys], we would like 
to express our concern about his 
opinion of Chatham College as 
being less than the respected 
academic institution it is.
As students at Chatham, we 
are hopeful that his ignorance 
will not have a negative influence 
on others who are not aware of 
the rigorous and challenging
atmosphere that exists at 
Chatham.
You are arrogantly mistaken, 
Stew, to suggest that Chatham 
would ever allow itself to be swal
lowed up and taken over, because 
a degree from Chatham is every 
bit as good as a degree from Car
negie Mellon.

I was initially pleased to see the 
front-page story in The Tartan 
last week, Shirley residents 
complain of harassment by gays 
near Dithridge. The previous 
issues article on complaints of 
gay harassment by Pittsburgh 
police seemed too one-sided in 
favor of gays  whether justified 
or not, it was impossible to judge 
from the article. I was hoping for 
the article on Shirley residents 
complaints to balance my under
standing of the issue.
No! I turned to page four and 
the article suddenly had a com
pletely different headline: Gays 
dispute alleged harassment on
Dithridge  completely chang
ing the point of view, and nicely 
ornamented by the boldface edi
torial comment by GALA mem
ber Michael Witbrock, placed so 
that it looks like a summary con
clusion of the article:
There are people sufficiently 
alarmed by the thought of gay 
people that I could perceive that 
its something more alarming to 
them than it should be... it may be 
that some of these cases of harass
ment are cases of panic.
Putting that comment there was 
stupid. In addition, the comment 
itself is invalid.
First: Two students interviewed 
by The Tartan report that they
're,ogfo 5elC8iu 1Chu Cgi 
,ouWrCgu fCgge5 Wo 5e,o8C5oi
feg5rg4oi U8e. sC1o q
clear, though, that nobody de
serves to die either because he or 
she is gay or because he or she has 
chosen to engage in sexual activ
ity in an inappropriate area. We 
} do not endorse engaging in sexual 
activity in public areas. However, 
we do not believe that, even if this 
was the case, it can in any way 
mitigate or justify the heinous
ness of the crime committed 
f against Mr. Piergalski.
Finally, it has been callously 
suggested that victims of violence 
almost deserve what they get 
when they choose to visit a place 
thought to be dangerous to some 
j degree. This completely misses 
the point. We speak for many 
people when we say that such 
dangerous places should not exist 
in the first place, and if they do, 
something should be done to make 
them safe again.
Several important points have 
. been raised in the Piergalski case. 
One is the fact that a violent crime 
occurs in a dangerous.area is not 
a justification for the crime, and 
that the area should be made safe, 
a Further, sexual activity in inap
propriate places, while a legiti
mate concern, has no relevance to 
either the Piergalski case or to 
lesbian and gay issues in general. 
Reporting of violent crimes 
* against lesbians and gays is poor 
largely due to the fear of discrimi
nation by police, employers and 
landlords. Finally, and most im
portantly, the central issue which 
must be addressed not just by 
police but by the community as a
whole is the violence directed at 
lesbian and gay people merely 
because of our sexual orientation. 
This violence, like all violence, is 
unacceptable.

have been followed on numerous 
occasions by complete strangers, 
and propositioned on at least one 
occasion. They also report that 
other students who live in the 
area have similar stories to tell.
Michael Witbrock, who has 
(presumably) never been present 
on any of these occasions, says 
that someone saying (hello) to a 
person on the street isnt harass
ment. This is true and irrelevant.
I hope that Michael Witbrock 
has no personal connection with 
any of these incidents of alleged 
harassment. If that is the case, 
then he has absolutely no connec
tion with the story either  nor, 
similarly, does the other GALA 
member who was interviewed for 
the story. Obtaining and publish
ing their editorial comments on a 
case they know nothing about 
personally is an example of the 
irrational policy of openness I 
expect to find pursued elsewhere. 
NOT by The Tartan.
Second: Witbrock suggests that 
people are sufficiently alarmed 
by the thought of gay people (to 
panic). Unfortunately for this line 
of reasoning, gay people do not 
wear signs around their necks
announcing that they are gay. 
They look just like other people. 
Why, then, would anyone panic 
about a gay person approaching 
them or following them if they 
dont know hes gay? I was ap
proached at 5:50 am over the 
summer and followed by a man in 
a car after Id made it clear I 
didnt want to talk to him. He 
could have been a mugger, which 
is what I thought at the time. 
Campus Police, after finding out 
where I was followed, told me 
that he was almost certainly a 
leftover from the previous nights 
gay cruising. Was I surprised? 
Yes.
I think we can all agree that 
people are sufficiently alarmed 
by the thought of complete strang
ers who follow them around on 
the borders of Oakland at night to 
panic. I have no problem with 
that as an explanation of the 
complaints. Would GALA have 
us think, No danger  its just a 
lonely gay man? They shouldnt. 
That is not a sufficient justifica
tion of these strangers behavior.

The nearly universal reaction 
upon hearing a tape recording of 
ones voice is, Gee, I did say this, 
but it sure doesnt sound like me. 
Such was my reaction when I read 
the article, Shutdowns plague 
Andrew upgrading process, in 
last weeks Tartan. I am pleased 
to see The Tartan reporting on 
issues about computing at CMU. 
And the words between the quo
tation marks are indeed mine, 
taken from an hour-and-a-half 
conversation intended to provide 
background information on the 
recent disruptions to campus file 
system service. But I am con
cerned that the article may send 
a message that neither I, nor the 
people in Academic Computing 
and Computing Systems who 
operate and administer the cam
pus cell of the Andrew File Sys
tem (AFS), wish to impart to the 
readers.
Some clarifications regarding 
Transare: First, the quality of the 
AFS software has always been 
very high and continues to im
prove at Transare. Readers must 
remember that a system as 
enormously complex and as vig
orously exercised as AFS is bound 
to have bugs. I remain confident 
in Transarcs increasing ability to 
eliminate bugs before we receive 
their software and to fix any that 
get past their testing procedures. 
Second, let there be no question 
about the level of Transarcs 
support for AFS at CMU. 
Throughout our difficulties, Tran
sare made fixing the bugs their
top priority. Individuals from the 
company spent long hours, many 
of them here at CMU, working 
with us to eliminate the prob
lems. That kind of commitment is 
rare and laudable. Third, I be
lieve that CMU and Transarc 
share a positive, give-and-take, 
relationship. We are not 
Transarcs guinea pig, because 
neither Transarc nor CMU wants 
that sort of arrangement. At this 
time, Trans arc is putting every 
resource toward bringing an 
industrial strength product to 
market. And we have everything 
to gain by bringing these improve
ments to campus as expediently 
as possible.
Some clarifications regarding 
CMU: First, though it is true that 
many of the people who created 
AFS have gone to Transarc, a 
greater number of highly talented 
people remain on campus to oper
ate, administer and occasionally 
debug AFS. These folks have put 
in heroic efforts and deserve rec
ognition for it. Second, users were 
very much affected by these out
ages. I regret that users suffered 
any unscheduled downtime dur
ing working hours. Though I be
lieve we were successful in mini
mizing the disruption, we are not 
content with that. We dont ex
pect you to be either. You have 
our continued commitment to a 
robust, stable, and reliable file 
system.

In the September 26 issue of 
The Tartan, David Ng wrote a 
letter to the Editor concerning an 
article by Jen Bannan in the 
Student Union entitled Emanci
pate Whom?
The issues in both the article 
and letter to the editor concern a 
talk by professor and member of 
Spanish Congress, Anna Balletbo 
and the movie A Clockwork Or
ange. In her article, Bannan de
scribes the gulf she sees between 
the hope for women expressed in 
Balletbos talk on feminism in 
Europe and the societal hatred 
for women expressed in a male 
crowds reaction to a rape scene in 
A Clockwork Orange. In his let
ter, Ng finds both womens views 
on feminism and on men objec
tionable.
Ng tries to support the message 
of A Clockwork Orange by argu
ing that the movie in no way 
condones rape. Rather, the
movies point was that condition
ing even the vilest member of 
society is wrong because it limits 
his freedom. Behind our backs, 
however, a base form of condi
tioning continues. While the 
movie might not condone rape;, it 
uses rape as an object to manipu
late in order to get to its first 
message, mens liberty. While we 
applaud Alexs fight, we are numb 
to the way women are objectified 
on the way. Then, when a woman 
stands up and objects, we blast 
her attempt at liberty.
In her talk, Balletbo described 
a successful demonstration in 
Spain against a case of discrimi
nation. Bannan felt that the 
demonstration was an expres
sion of power. Men see power as 
exclusive, however. If it was an 
expression of power for women, 
then it must be a loss for men. 
Consequently, Ng deflates the 
significance of the demonstration

RNThe Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  3 October 1989
Oe,4.gru5 r1ge8oi 5Po r.se85Cg5 UoC548ou eU C 4grno8ur5h
Editor:
On behalf of the students and 
faculty of Chatham College, I 
would like to respectfully submit 
a reply to Stew Levines article 
CMU Needs a Bigger Attic for its 
Toys which appeared in the 
September 19 edition of The Tar
tan.
I would like to call attention to 
Mr. Levines claim that [a]fter 
all, Chatham is really not much of 
a school. I could not agree with 
him more; Chatham is not a 
school, rather it is a college. Ac
cording to Merriam Webster, a 
school is an institute for teach
ing and learning, while a college 
is an institute for higher learn
ing granting a bachelors degree. 
Similarly, a university is an insti
tute of higher learning author
ized to confer degrees in various 
special fields as well as in the arts 
and sciences generally. I am sure 
we can agree that a college or
Letters to the Editor
university consists of more than 
the awarding of a degree, so for 
the sake of semantics, we shall 
call both Chatham and Carnegie 
Mellon centers of learning.
What is a center of learning, 
and what does one do there? 
Obviously it is not a toy box, as 
Mr. Levine suggests, but rather a 
place where one goes to be edu
cated. To receive an education is 
to be developed and cultivated 
mentally, morally, and physically, 
or (if I may be so bold as to expli
cate) to learn to be able to make 
an intelligent and valuable con
tribution to society.
Perhaps it is now pertinent to 
discuss the more superficial points 
of Mr. Levines article. First, to 
address his complaint against the 
prevalence of Chatham students
at CMU on Friday and Saturday 
nights. Throughout the semester 
women go to Chatham to get an 
education. If they choose to go out 
on weekends  we can agree, I 
am sure, this is not an unpardon
able sinand if they choose to go 
to Carnegie Mellon or the Univer
sity of Pittsburgh, that is their 
business. However, most 
Chatham students are unaware 
of the parties held at CMU or Pitt 
unless they are advertised. Tell 
me Mr. Levine, if you do not want 
us at CMU, why plaster 
Chathams memo-boards with ad
vertisements for fraternity beerblasts?
Second, Carnegie Mellons field 
hockey team does not practice on 
Chathams field simply because 
it is Carnegie Mellons field hockey 
team, but by virtue of Chathams 
generosity (an example of a valu
able contribution to society). 
There is an inconsistency in your
logic Mr. Levine  no generosity, 
no field hockey team. Think about 
it.
I hope I have succeeded in pre
senting to Mr. Levine, and those 
of similar opinion, what a school 
is, and what a center of learning 
is, and would like to conclude with 
this remark. Whether it is a col
lege or a university, a center of 
learning is more than a computer 
center and an attic full of hi-tech 
toys. It is more than the buildings 
where one attends classes. The 
most important components of a 
center of learning are its student 
body and faculty  those dedi
cated to the promotion of higher 
education, who aspire to achieve 
intellectual, emotional, and physi
cal well being. Put that on your 
computer disk, Mr. Levine, and 
let it stew.

some male attitudes change.
I think David Ng failed to real
ize that I was making a moral 
challenge to men (that which he 
quoted) to try not to enjoy the 
debasement of women so thor
oughly. He calls it a double stan
dard that I dont want men to 
enjoy the debasement of women, 
but that I enjoy stories about 
womens protests. This isnt a 
double standard because the
womens rights protest was an 
expression of power in the face of 
oppression, while the men in the 
scenes I mentioned of A Clock
work Orange were not being op
pressed. I didnt write much on 
moral terms, but the moral was 
there. The thing about morals is 
that for ages the people with the 
power (men) have been the ones 
who decided what morals were. 
Morals and power are inter
twined, however unfortunate that
may seem. Equal terms for men 
and women depend on a certain 
increase in the power of women. 
And in America, equality is sup
posed to be morally correct. Get
ting wrapped up in morals has 
been what has kept women quiet 
in the past. Nice girls didnt 
want power, nice girls didnt speak 
out. Well, women are speaking 
out. If it sounds powerful, so be it. 
If it leads to equality, then its 
moral, right?
I would be interested to know 
why David Ng didnt submit his 
letter to the Student Union. It 
seems rather odd that Ng wasnt 
comfortable submitting to the Un
ion. It would have been a differ
ent story if the Union had refused 
to print his letter, but it was never 
even submitted. Looks like an
other question of morals.

for women by calling it not a 
victory by women over men, but a 
victory by right over wrong. If 
accepted, this effectively diffuses 
the real facts. The people who 
instigated the victory were 
women. They were called to re
spond because of the ignorance of 
- the man (the man was not unique
in this ignorance, however).
If this was merely a demonstra
tion for a generally held right 
over a generally held wrong, 
then the demonstration would not 
have been made up solely of 
women. Therefore, unless you 
believe that knowledge of right 
is excluded from women, this fight 
was, indeed, a victory for women.
Furthermore, if you believe that 
it was also a victory for right, 
and if women were the sole carri
ers of this right message, then it 
follows that women are likely to 
be the prophetic voices in our 
moral elevation (Ngs term). 
Consequently, we men should be 
listening very closely to women 
such as Jen Bannan and Anna
Balletbo. If what they are saying 
does not fit our model of the world, 
perhaps our male model is wrong. 
The only way we will know is to 
stop trying to kill the dignity of 
their experience and insights. 
Perhaps it is us who do not see.

As I read through the most 
recent issue of the Student Un
ion (Vol. 5, No. 2), I noticed a 
particularly interesting letter 
written by Blaire Freed of 
Chatham College. Apparently, 
The Tartan had run an unusu
ally arrogant and sexist article 
in last weeks issue. Being an 
avid reader of The Tartan, I 
found this hard to believe. I 
soon found my disbelief to be 
well-founded.
When rereading the article in 
question, Stew Levines Inquir
ing Minds column, I realized 
why I had never noticed this 
blatant disrespect the first time. 
It didnt exist! I realize that 
Stew took a few liberties at 
Chathams expense, but it in no 
way deserved a full page, un
founded, and incomprehensible 
rebuttal.
To begin with, how can you 
dispute a statement like, the 
school named after Pittsburghs 
two richest Andrews? Andrew 
Carnegie. Andrew Mellon. Car
negie Mellon. Get it?
As for seeing Chatham stu
dents at CMU other than at fra
ternities, I never have. Being 
on campus because you have 
classes here has nothing to do 
with being a student at 
Chatham. I find myself on the 
CMU campus quite often.
These two minor points, as 
well as a few references to
Chatham dating patterns con
sisted of nearly 80 percent of 
the letter. Not once is the point 
of the original article ever ac
knowledged; however, Stews 
use of the word lady is noted. 
Unfortunately, if Blaire had 
bothered to read past the first 
definition in Websters, she may 
have noticed the further defini
tion (as Stews usage implies), 
a polite term for any woman.
The final 20 percent, minus 
some unnecessary bragging 
about the Chatham Board of 
Trustees salaries, was devoted 
to Stews equating women to 
toys. This interpretation is 
absurd. It is obvious that the 
toys referred to in the article 
are various items that Carne
gie Mellon has no room for, not 
women. If nothing else, I dont 
want [Chatham College] for its 
women  I want it for its huge 
tracts of land, should clue you 
in.
In closing I have just one ques
tion. How can you rebut a col
umn with statements like 
should your IQ be above 60 
and committing suicide would 
have accomplished the same 
result, and saved us all the space 
that male chauvinists like you 
occupy on this earth, and still 
sign it Respectfully Submit
ted? I cant.

ORCHESTRATING IC DESIGN
JAM SESSION
^ On.r-amniic Torr Qpccinn nn.r1 omnncOn-Campus Jam Session
October 11, 1989
In 1782, in the court of Emperor Joseph II, a 
brash young composer named Wolfgang Amadeus 
Mozart set the music world on its ear. A radical 
departure from the current fashion in music, 
he set a new standard for style and composition.
It has always been so. The old guard surpassed 
by a new wave. It's true today in the area of 
software tools for IC Design Automation (ICDA). 
Cadence broke with the conventional order to 
create the industrys only completely integrated 
ICDA software solution. Our high-performance 
CAD/CAE tools are coordinated into one har
monious environment, allowing the user to 
arrange the entire IC design process from 
design entry to final verification.
Our approach to integrating the IC design 
process has made Cadence the leader in ICDA 
software. Significantly larger than our nearest 
competitor, we are a financially-secure, fullyresourced company. And were growing at 70% 
a year. Thats twice as fast as the industry average.
The expertise we've acquired by orchestrating 
different elements and helping them to work 
in concert is reflected in our workplace as 
well. At Cadence all team members, veteran 
and recent grad alike, are involved in a crea
tive process infused with intelligence, enthusiasm 
and personal commitment. For you, this means

I enjoy football, especially

But when baseball 
ends, it marks the end of 
of the most vital and 
derful times of the year, 
link about it. The leaves die 
fall off the trees, cold winds 
jtart a-blowin, it's just not a 
(rery pleasant time of year.
But we can all take comfort in 
;he fact that there is still a good 
three or so weeks of baseball 
left. Play-offs and the World 
Series are a good ways away, so 
3ve are not quite at the edge of 
the cliff yet, by God.
Even with so much baseball 
left, however, people around 
here seem content to walk off 
that cliff early and plunge,
^leart and soul, into football.
Now, Pittsburgh is a great 
sports town in general. With the 
exception of basketball fans, 
almost anyone could get every
thing they want in terms of 
.sports out of this town, 
r This town, deep down inside, 
loves the Steelers even when 
they lose. Even with the 1990s 
bearing down upon us, millions 
of fans refuse to let up one inch 
on the memories of the great 
iteelers of the 1970s.
This fanaticism is most 
ivident on the Steelers radio 
Broadcast. It just goes on and 
on. First they have the half 
our pre-game, then they have 
e first half, then the 15 
inute recap of the first half.
,en they broadcast the second

d then recap the entire game. 
Im sorry, but thats just tooimned-much football for one 
jerson for one day.
In the meantime, several 
laseball games are played all 
jver the country. But on the 
ical news programs, all of 
ese games are given about 
ve minutes of coverage  just 
nough to give the scores and 
tandings. Even when the Steelrs get killed, these same 
tations feel justified, to spend 
) minutes on locker room 
iterviews.
Now this is what I cant figure 
ut, if this is the most imporant part of the regular baseball 
eason, when the division titles 
re decided, then why is the 
rost unimportant part of the 
jotball season, the first weeks,

Cross-Country has a perfect win against Geneva College
By ROBIN HENSINGER
Tartan Staffwriter
Saturdays beautiful autumn 
weather supplied Carnegie 
Mellons mens cross-country team 
with great running conditions, as 
they defeated Geneva College in 
a shut-out victory.
The Tartans brought in ten 
runners, before a single Geneva 
runner crossed the finish line on 
the home course at Schenley Park. 
The final score was 15-50, the 
widest margin possible in a dual 
meet.
Carnegie Mellons star runner, 
senior Dave Supp, won the meet 
in 26:03. Supp was 40 seconds 
ahead of the pack after three 
miles, and Head Coach Gary 
Meckley stated that he ran those 
three miles faster than any run
ner ever has on that course. Supp 
has not lost a dual meet in two 
years, and is hoping to break the 
course record next week.
Assisting Supp in the landslide
victory were teammates junior 
Dan Holland in second, sopho
more Mike Damon in third, and 
senior Gary Meeker in fourth. 
They came in 26:22, 26:24, and 
26:28 respectively. This was the 
highest that Holland and Damon 
have placed this year, signifying 
that they may be crucial to the 
team in the more difficult meets 
ahead. Gary Meeker has been 
running consistently well all 
season and his contribution to the 
team is essential.
Co-captain Len ONeal came 
back strongly this week after 
missing last weeks race due to 
illness. He placed fifth overall this 
week in 26:42.
The top two runners at last 
weeks Slippery Rock Invitational, 
sophomore Russ Shorkey, and 
junior Gary Harrison, were 
missed at this weeks meet. They 
took the day off to prepare for 
next weeks race.
The course record for Schenley 
Park is 24:57 which is currently
held by the womens cross-coun
try coach, All-American Dario 
Donatelli. Supp, also an AllAmerican whos fastest time on 
the course is 25:14, stands a good 
chance of breaking the record at 
next weeks meet. He did not try 
for it this week because of advice 
from Coach Meckley.
The meet against Geneva was 
obviously not a challenging one, 
however, they will run on Friday 
against Allegheny Nike. The 
runners are sponsored by Nike 
and consist of men of various ages. 
There will be CMU graduate 
students and alumni present, 
which should prove to be an excit
ing and challenging race against 
the Tartans.
Fridays meet will take place at 
6:30 pm at Schenley Park, which 
will provide the men with cobler 
weather for the race. Supp sees 
this as an asset to a fast-paced 
race adding that the competition 
we will be facing will also moti
vate me to break the record.

Although its play was a little 
off in the first match against 
Washington and Jefferson, the 
womens volleyball team 
bounced back in the second 
match to just barely fall short 
of defeating Waynesburg 
Thursday.
In the match against Wash
ington and Jefferson, the Lady 
Tartans just could not get 
anything together. They 
played inconsistently and 
quickly became frustrated. 
They felt that they were play
ing against a much weaker 
opponent. <rWe didnt play very 
well, but luck didnt go our 
way either, said player Eliza
beth Rowlands. As a result, 
Carnegie Mellon lost the 
match in two straight games.
The second match, against 
Waynesburg, proved to be a 
breakthrough in the teams 
progress this season. Accord
ing to Lady Tartan Lisa 
Devlin, it was the first time 
we started to really play, to
gether like a team. During 
the first game, CMU executed 
well and stunned Waynesburg 
by winning 15-3. The team 
seemed to lose its momentum 
in the second game and Way
nesburg used it to its advan
tage.
In the third game, Way
nesburg recovered to regain 
the upper hand. However, 
little inconsistencies caused 
some problems for them. The 
match continued to stay very 
close, with CMU narrowly los
ing the third game 15-13.
Despite the losses, the Lady 
Tartans returned home en
couraged by the type of play 
they exhibited.
We were so excited because 
we played so well in the sec
ond match, said Devlin. The 
team also feels its high level 
of play will continue.We just 
keep getting better and bet
ter, said Rowlands.
Next weekend, the Lady 
Tartans will travel to Chicago 
to compete in the University 
Athletic Association Tourna
ment.

A 4-1 loss to Juniata College may not seem 
like something to celebrate about, but for the 
womens field hockey team, it was a milestone 
in the season.
Last year, the Lady Tartans were crushed by 
Juniata, who is ranked ninth in Division III. 
The first-half score by Sue Moll on an assist by 
Lisa VanderMeer was enough to make this a 
great game for CMU.
Juniata is a very high ranked team and we 
just went into the game hoping to improve upon 
last year, said VanderMeer.
The whole game was characterized by 
exceptional playing on CMITs part, which was 
a surprise, said VanderMeer. We played better 
than expected, she said. We all played as a 
team and everyone had a great game.
After the score in the first half, which was the 
first score of the game, CMU looked in charge of 
the game.
Friday, the team faces Washington and 
Jefferson at home.

Frustration sets in as soccer loses to Case Western, 1-0
By JASON MCDONALD
Tartan Senior Staffwriter
The Carnegie Mellon soccer team seems to have 
fallen into a bit of a rut this season. Three of the 
Tartans last four games have followed the same 
pattern: the Tartans,play a great game, but end up 
with a loss. The latest of these frustrating setbacks 
came Tuesday as Carnegie Mellon lost to Case West
ern Reserve University, 1-0.
According to Head Coach Nick Gaudioso, If posses
sion was the game, we would have won easily. The 
numbers from the game seem to bear him out as the
Tartans outshot Case Western Reserve 16-6, and held a 
102 edge in comer kicks. However, explains Gaudioso, 
we had a lot of good opportunities where we didnt score. 
The frustration of losing the game was compounded by 
the way the winning goal was scored. We tried to clear the 
ball out of the penalty area, recalls Gaudioso, and we 
didnt get itfarenough away. Its probably the only goal that 
guy will ever score in his life.
The only other soccer news of the week was not a game, 
but rather, lack of a game. Saturdays scheduled Alumni 
Game was cut from the schedule because there werent 
enough former soccer players available to form a team. A 
reschedule against LaRoche Colleges club team was in the
works, but was cancelled soon after.
The Alumni Game has no bearing on the standings, 
so its cancellation will not affect the Tartans remain
ing schedule, which resumes today as CMU (4-4 over
all, 1-3 in University Athletic Association competi
tion) faces the University of Rochester.
University of Rochester should pose a major chal
lenge to the Tartans, as the team is described as more 
physical but less skilled than Emory, which beat the 
Tartans, 2-1, last week. Rochester had been unde
feated before losing, 1-0, to Rochester Institute of 
Technology, which made it to last years Division III 
finals.

This is the second in a four part 
series of NHL predictions.
Patrick Division
For years the tightest and 
toughest division in hockey, the 
Patrick division slipped last year 
and will slip still more this year 
as compared to the Smythe and 
Adams divisions.
While the Penguins have a good 
chance to mature and play a more 
disciplined game than last year 
and the Devils have added 
strength in a number of problem 
areas, the Flyers, Rangers, and 
Islanders are weaker than last 
year; and the Washington Capi
tols are a big question mark.
Pittsburgh Penguins
Strengths: Best offense in the 
division. Mario Lemieux is the 
biggest impact player in the game. 
Although sometimes inconsistent, 
Paul Coffey can turn a game 
around. Tom Barrasso is a solid 
goalkeeper. Zarley Zalapski is one 
of the best young defensemen in 
the game.
Weaknesses: Even with trades 
for Gil Delorme and Jim Kyte, 
the Penguin defense is weak. Bar
rasso gets shelled too many times. 
Rob Brown couldhavehadafluke 
year and the Pens need his scor
ing. Injuries to Lemieux, Coffey, 
Zalapski, or Barrasso would be 
crippling. Back-up goalies Young 
and Pietrangelo are not first rate.
Overall: With all 
their problems, the 
Pens should still win 
the division. Keys to 
their playoff advance
ment will be effective 
defense, increased 
production by Bob 
Errey and a good year 
by Kevin Smith. The 
Penguins will not lose 
first place in the divi
sion, they will have to 
be knocked from it.
New Jersey Devils 
Strengths: Soviet 
Viacheslav Fetisov is 
widely hailed as the 
best defenseman in 
thegame, supposedlyinthe same

IM football, volleyball battles continue
By KEVIN BARNEY
Tartan Asst. Features Editor
Intramural action continued 
with heated battles in touch foot
ball and volleyball as time moves 
on toward championship play.
Monday, the Hotels were de
molished by KSA in the minors 
league of IM football. Three days 
later, Beta did the same to its op
ponents, GSIA, in the major IM 
football league. In the minors 
league of IM volleyball, Mudge 3- 
C defeated USS Carnegie to clinch 
first place in its division and a 
playoff spot.
IM action commenced with the 
KSA blowout of the Hotels. The 
game started with the Hotels 
receiving the kickoff, and on the 
second play of the drive the Ho
tels quarterback was intercepted 
by KSAs Joe Choe. KSA took one 
play to score its first touchdown 
when Bryan Lee, the KSA quar
terback, connected with Dave Lee.
The Hotels were more cautious 
during their next drive, trying to 
stay to the ground, but several 
sacks later they found that they 
had to return to the air. Fourth 
down came and the Hotels de
cided to go for it but failed.
KSA started their drive with a 
couple of dropped passes and a 
quarterback run. Bryan Lee found 
Dave Lee in the endzone for the 
second KSA touchdown with only
25 seconds left in the first half. 
Sean Shaheen, The Hotels QB, 
threw a long bomb that was inter
cepted by Dave Lee. With only 
seconds left in the first half, KSA 
also went for the long bomb. 
Shaheen intercepted the Bryan 
Lee pass and returned it to about 
midfield before he was downed 
and the half ended with KSA 
fourteen points over The Hotels.
The second half started with
The Hotels kicking off to KSA. 
Bryan Lee hit Wan Kwak for the 
third TD of the game. The extra 
point attempt was no good. The 
game continued with KSA domi
nating the Hotels in every aspect 
of the game. With 23 seconds left 
in the game, the Hotels became 
the first minors team to score 
against KSA. Sean Shaheen con
nected with Mark Crowther for 
the Hotels only TD of the game. 
The final score of the game was 
KSA 46 to the Hotels 6.
In the minors league of co-rec 
volleyball, Mudge 3-C clinched 
first place in their division with a 
victory over the previously unde
feated USS Carnegie.
The first game of the three game 
series wasnt in Mudges favor, 
however. USS Carnegie took the 
early lead and kept it throughout 
the game, disorienting Mudge 
3-C, who had trouble with re
turning the ball. The result was 
that USS won the first game by a 
score of 15-9.
The second game was the turn
ing point in the contest. Mudge 
immediately took a three point 
lead with a score of 9-6 before 
USS came back. USS scored seven 
points in a row, putting them only 
two points away from victory, but 
were disappointed when Mudge 
had three aces in a row, thanks to 
Kris Pasqualin's serving, which 
gave her team the advantage with 
a score of 15-14. The game ended 
a point later, keeping the hopes of 
Mudge 3-C alive.
The third game was as one
sided as the first. Although this 
time the dominant team was 
Mudge 3-C. Rich Robinson 
brought the Mudge team to the 
early 7-1 lead before his serving 
streak was cut short. USS Carne
gie managed to tie and then add 
two points to their score before

Weaknesses: The Devils de
fense stinks, their penalty killing

season was non-existent. Also, the 
team is almost fifty percent new, 
with many of the most talented 
players joining the team for the 
first time. The Devils look good on 
paper, but are a big unknown. 
Back-up goalkeeping is iffy.
Overall: If all the new players 
play as well as their stats, the 
Devils could unseat the Penguins
from the top of the division. Mott 
likely, only some of the new plaj. 
ers will make an impact, and tis 
Devils will end up in second.

they were stopped. Mudge was 
down by a score of 9-7 when Chris 
Cook took over as server and 
served for the last eight points.
The game was won as Frank 
Altier spiked the ball onto the 
USS Carnegie court. Mudge 3-C 
is now in first place in their divi
sion and they will start on the 
road to the championship game 
this week.
In IM majors football, Beta met 
and crushed GSIA Thursday. The 
game started off with a play that 
was a good indicator of how the 
rest of the game would go. J.D. 
Heskamp, the Beta QB, ran down 
the side of the field into the 
endzone.
GSIA tried its hand at offense 
and they were a little more suc
cessful than they were on defense. 
Four plays later, GSIAhad punted 
the ball away. Beta took over and 
scored again on another Heskamp 
run. Beta failed to convert for the 
extra point again.
GSIA started its second drive of 
the game. The drive lasted 10 
plays and covered most of the 
field, yet it ended in a failed fourth 
down conversion. To add to the 
crushed hopes of GSIA, Beta 
scored on the first play of its third 
drive on a long bomb that covered 
most of the field. Heskamp had 
connected with one of his favorite 
receivers, Dan Crimmins for the 
TD. The first half ended with Beta 
leading 19-0.
The second half of the game 
started with another failed GSIA 
drive and with a fight breaking 
out, causing the referee to throw 
two players out of the game. Two 
plays later, Heskamp ran in his 
fourth touchdown.
The game ended with GSIA 
finally getting some points on the 
board, with a TD in the final sec
onds. The final score was 25-7.

in a time of 15:06.32, behind Tampa, Cornell, and Villanova. The 
crew for this boat included cox Sue Olyarnik and rowers Bart Wise, 
John Ambroziak, Glen Tasewicz and Dan Murphy.
Rounding out the Carnegie Mellon crews for the men was the 
lightweight division team of cox Sophie Chiang and rowers Dan Ross, 
^John Knight, Ted Ralphs, and Shawn Ohler. The team took fifth 
place in 14:58.00, only nine seconds behind the third place finishers.
The womens club team also captured a bronze medal for the third 
spot in 16:50.41. They were just behind the Notre Dame team which 
had a time of 16:19.30 and the 16:40.24 second place from Duquesne. 
In the CMU boat were cox Chan and rowers Anna Loney, Ellen 
3arry, Carrie Teodori, and Gross. It was an admirable finish for the 
women considering that they were rowing for the first time in a boat 
they borrowed from North Allegheny High School. For this finish the 
women beat out the Three Rivers Rowing Association, University of 
Toledo, Miami University of Ohio, WVU, and Case Western Reserve. 
This crew also has the added distinction of beinginvited to participate 
in the Head of the Charles Regatta in Boston, October 21.
Gross was excited about the Rowing Clubs achievments. We have 
improved a lot since last year. The coach [Liz Winter] was extremely 
happy. We couldnt have been more psyched to have medaled.

Sorenson about eight years ago, it 
has remained popular due to its 
energetic style and ability to 
achieve a variety of fitness levels.
Aerobic dance has proven itself 
efficient in handling the fitneBS 
needs of a variety of people. 
Classes can be easily arranged 
from beginner to advanced, so two 
people of different fitness levels 
can receive the same benefit, even 
if each is doing a completely dif
ferent workout.
When deciding which class level 
is best for an individual, a num
ber of things should be taken into 
consideration. The personal tar
get heart rate will determine, to 
a certain extent, what level of ex
ercise will most affect a person. 
The target heart rate is deter
mined by taking the pulse during 
exercise. This can be done by 
taking a ten-second reading from 
the wrist and multiplyingitby six 
to find a one-minute reading. 
Compare the results with the 
following equations:
(220 - age) x .60 = minimal eltect 
(220 - age) x .80= maximum effect 
The pulse rate should be some
where around 70-80 percent of 
what the heart can actually with
stand. Anything above 85 percent 
will have a negative reaction, 
because fatigue and exhaustion
will occur.
A class that is too easy will not 
achieve the desired results, while 
one that is too advanced will force 
the participant to overdo it.
In order to have a consistent 
effect, the target heart rate must 
not only be achieved, it should be 
kept for 20 to 30 minutes. This 
should be repeated three times 
per week to keep the present fit
ness level, four to five times per 
week to increase the present fit
ness level.
Each step in aerobics is meant 
to perform a function. A session 
should include a warm-up, 
strength-building exercise, aero
bic exercise, and a cool-down, so
in the end a good class will take 
longer than 20-30 minutes. Re
member this when choosing a 
class: a good instructor will know 
these steps and will not compro
mise.
Unlike most sports, aerobic 
dance can be done alone or with a 
group. VCR and cassette tapes 
are a worthwhile investment if 
there is no time to go to a class.
Classes can be found almost 
anywhere, and CMU offers 22 ses
sions per week. This means aero
bics can be done with other stu
dents and without even leaving 
campus. For those who enjoy it, 
aerobics is one of the easiest and 
liveliest ways to keep in shape.

Womens tennis snags 
first wins of season
By KATIE CULBERTSON
Tartan Asst. Sports Editor
The Womens Tennis Team is 
not exactly starting from scratch, 
but according to Head Coach Julie 
Babler, the goal of this season is 
rebuilding.
We had a few girls graduate 
and some not come out, she said. 
While there is only one freshman 
playing on the team, three out of 
last years top six are not back, 
said Babler.
Babler appreciates having a lot 
of upperclassmen on the team. 
Theyre mature, she said. They 
know what to expect.
She said the team needs to work 
on drills in practice and its strate
gies on the court.
Wednesday, the Lady Tartans 
faced off against W ashington and 
Jefferson, a team in the 
Presidents Athletic Conference
that is pretty tough, said Babler. 
But CMU managed to come away 
with its first win of the season, 
winning 6-3.
Saturday, the Lady Tartans 
continued their winning streak 
by defeating Case Western Re
serve University 8-1.
They [CMU] played really 
well, said Babler. Im really 
proud of them. She was espe
cially proud of the No. 1 and 2 
singles players, Mary Beth Asbaugh and Beth Cavanaugh, who 
overcame much to win their 
matches, both in three sets.
This season, the team is aiming 
for second place in the PAC out of 
four teams. Babler said Grove City 
would prove to be the biggest 
obstacle in the PAC, although it is 
not as strong as last year.
Friday, the team goes to Thiel 
College, and then heads to Grove 
City for the PAC championships.
Rugby disappointed at Slippery Rock
By KATIE CULBERTSON
Tartan Assistant Sports Editor
To some, the mention of rugby conjures up 
images of a harsh and violent sport.
But to the CMU Rugby Club, it is more than 
smashing bodies chasing after a ball. Rugby 
player Mike Lindenberg agreed that it is an 
aggressive sport. You have to be mean to win, 
he said.
They were just much bigger 
and in better shape.

Local groups support victims
By J.L. MORRISON
Tartan Staffwriter
Walking down a dark street, 
eyes glued to the sidewalk ahead, 
alone except for the sounds of 
distant traffic is the potential 
victim, prey of rape, physical 
assault, robbery, or some other 
violent crime.
But not all crime takes place on 
the street; one can become a vic
tim anywhere, at home, work, or 
even at school. It can happen at 
any time and to anyone, regard
less of age, lifestyle, race, or sex. 
There are no typical victims, 
according to Lavanda Sloan, an 
educational specialist at PAAR, 
Pittsburgh Action Against Rape.
PAAR is one of several groups 
in the Pittsburgh area that offer 
help and support to crime vic
tims. PAARs services include 
counseling, educational programs 
and seminars at all levels, parent 
and professional training, and 
also a hotline. Sloan says most 
calls are from people who were 
sexually assaulted as children. 
Many callers are older women 
who after thirty years finally 
want to break the silence. Gen
erally, she says callers are look
ing for a caring voice on the other 
side ... they want someone else
Even if we cannot help the victim re
gain lost items, we can at least circu
late word of possible danger to the rest 
of campus.
B Director of Security James LaPaglia
they dont know to hear their 
story.
The Allegheny County Center 
for Victims of Violent Crime, 
simply known as the Center for 
Victims, is another support group. 
Carol Campbell, a training and 
educational specialist at the 
Center, says that the Center tries 
to  ... provide more individual, 
sensitive and caring assistance 
to victims and prosecution wit
nesses at no charge to victim and 
family in robbery, rape, burgulary, aggravated assault, and 
homicide.
The Center for Victims, like 
PARR and Family Resources, a 
group that works primarily with 
victims of child abuse and those 
under 18, offers a 24-hour hotline 
and counseling services, but it 
also assists victims as they go 
through the various legal, gov
ernment, and court systems. The 
Center can provide court accom
paniment at request, professional 
legal and medical advocacy, post
trial support counseling and 
advocacy, explanation of the legal 
system, as well as help with vic
tims compensation.
The Center receives 1500 to 
2100 calls annually. Of its total 
cases, 46 percent are robberies, 6 
percent are homicides, 2 percent 
are burglaries and thefts, and 1 
percent are harassment and in
timidation. Campbell says that 
51 percent of all the Centers cases 
involve victims under age 21. She 
commented that this statistic is 
probably because teenagers tend 
to be more vulnerable to violent 
crime due to homelessness or 
drug-related problems. Not sur
prisingly, sixteen to seventeen

One survivors story: coming back after rape; it takes strength to face every day
Editors note: Due to the sensitive 
nature of this story, all names have been 
changed to protect the privacy of the 
parities involved, and the writers name 
has been withheld upon request.
Anne Bryant ran with her sorority sis
ters from fraternity to fraternity cheer
ing in celebration of their new pledges. 
Anne was excited and full of energy, 
because this was one of the biggest nights 
of the year for the Greeks.
At each house the elated group of 
women counted off the number of their 
members, ending with one oftheir songs. 
They had gotten halfway around the 
quad when the girls decided that QLM 
would be the next house.
Here, Anne had earlier decided that
... only 10 percent of college rapes are re
ported to the police, and only 26 percent are 
reported to the university.
she would wait outside, but now the 
groups enthusiasm carried her along.
Once in the fraternity, the memories 
that Anne held flooded her mind, and it 
was no longer a warm night in early fall, 
but cold during late winter.
She drew away from the group and 
stood watching and shivering with her 
back to a wall. Another sister grabbed 
her by the hand and led her outside. I
understand, she told Anne. Ill take 
care of you.
For the rest of the night, scenes of a 
fraternity party, a bedroom, a mans face, 
silent terror, and a hospital room kept 
running through her head, until she 
finally went to sleep after drinking too 
much to obliterate the nightmares.
This situation may not be an average 
occurrence in Annes life, but it is only
one of her more dramatic reactions since 
being raped as a freshman. During her 
first year at school, a member of the 
QLM fraternity took advantage of both 
her naivete and the fact that she was 
intoxicated, by luring her to an empty 
room and forcing intercourse. In the 
months following, Anne underwent coun
seling for sexual violence.
Rape on college campuses is by no 
means rare. One in every six women who 
attend college is raped. For example, at 
Florida State in 1988, three fraternity 
brothers were charged with assault and 
battery of an eighteen-year-old. The men 
carried her to a rival fraternity house in 
order to have the blame placed on the 
house instead. At Kentucky State, five 
students, four of whom were members of
the football team, were charged with 
first degree rape, sodomy, and unlawful 
imprisonment. At McGill University, a 
freshman was assaulted at the Zeta Psi 
house while ten others looked on.
The horror stories can go on and on, 
but these publicized cases are only a 
fraction of what actually occurs. Accord
ing to a survey conducted at universities 
and colleges in 1988, only 10 percent of 
college rapes are ever reported to th 
police, and only 26 percent of the actual 
number are ever reported to the univer
sity.
It is easy to see from these statistics 
that there are a lot of young women on 
college campuses who are victims of vio
lence. What makes Anne different is that

The key to crime prevention is preparation, caution
By TRUPTI PATEL
Tartan Staffwriter
Imagine coming home late Friday night from a 
party and finding your door ajar. As you go inside, 
you realize that someone has stolen all of your 
valuables. Or, as you walk home late from the 
library or a friends room, you notice someone 
following you. What do you do? Could you have 
prevented these situations in the first place?
University security forces emphasize the impor
tance of developing an educational approach against 
crime. As a student, being aware of the dangers 
around you, whether they be in the form of theft, 
sexual crimes, or other crimes, can reduce your 
chances of becoming a victim.
CMU Security has established a number of crime 
prevention tactics for the benefit and protection of 
students. Campus Security Director James La
Paglia says that crime alert bulletins are posted 
throughout the campus in order to inform students
about recent criminal incidents so that they can 
take appropriate precautionary measures. These 
bulletins also include prevention tips which stu
dents can follow in order to avoid becoming crime 
victims.
Another measure which campus security has 
taken is the establishment of the Carnegie Mellon 
Police Crime Prevention Unit. The Crime Preven
tion Unit teaches students how to protect them
selves against crime. Students interested in find
ing out more information should call Investigator 
William T. Kaiser or Sergeant Richard E. Sima at 
x2323.
LaPaglia says that property crime is the most 
common type of crime on college campuses. He adds 
that Carnegie Mellon averages around thirty thefts 
per month, 95 percent of which do not require forced 
entry. LaPaglia says, The fact that there were very 
few forced entries proves that thefts can very easily 
prevented.
Keeping doors locked during absences from your
room and not propping dormitory entrance doors 
open are excellent measures in preventing theft. 
Also, taking advantage ofthe 24-hour escort service 
provided by Security may decrease your chances of 
physical assault.
Other methods of crime prevention include selfdefence classes, such as those that are offered by 
the Campus Police department, and carrying pro
tective instruments such as a signal horn. LaPaglia 
undercuts the value of studying karate, saying that 
it is a form of self-defence that takes a long time to 
master.
On the other hand, he lauds signal horns, which 
are offered in the university bookstore for $5.95, as 
a protective tool more effective than mace. The horn 
emits a piercing blast of noise when depressed.
Making use of the crime alerts, the Crime Pre
vention Unit, and following simple crime preven
tion measures might not guarantee you immunity 
against crime, but it can significantly reduce your 
risk.

Crime touches everyday life
By ANDREW WHEELER
 Tartan Staffwriter
We hear about crime every day, 
in the newspaper, on the radio, 
and on television  burglaries, 
murders, rapes, assaults. Yet, 
even though we are inundated 
with news of crimes from every 
side, we still tend to believe that 
it cant happen to us. Unfortu
nately, this is not the case, as 
many of us learn through painful
oyso8rogfoT
On-campus crimes, mainly 
theft, occur almost on a daily basis. 
In addition, more serious crimes, 
including burglaries and murders, 
loom overhead for students both 
on and off campus.
Overall, there has been a de
crease in the number of crimes 
reported to Campus Police over 
the past few years. Despite this 
decrease, however, the number of 
thefts has remained fairly con
stant.
Theft refers to the act of taking 
items from an unlocked location. 
Burglary, on the other hand, deals 
with breaking and entering a 
secured area with intent to steal 
property within the area.
Thefts greatly outnumber any 
other crime committed on cam
pus. According to the records of 
Campus Police, over 38% of re
ported crimes over the past four

Asking Rita Dove: What is poetry?
PPUdszSr wdAASr gdvSe DdesdAgPdeiSY LScsPrS
By EDITH LAURENCIN
Tartan Staffwriter
Exceptional precision, strikingimages, and diamond sharp 
lyricism.
These were the words Mi
chael Sovern, President of 
Colombia University, used to 
describe the poetry of Rita 
Dove at the Pulitzer Prize 
Awards Ceremony in May1987.
Rita Dove was the second 
speaker in this years 
Presidents Distinguished Lec
ture Series, co-sponsoredby the 
Activities Board, that took place 
last Wednesday in the Adam
son Wing.
She was asked to speak on 
the topic writing poetry, 
which she described as an im
possible task. Instead, she con
centrated on her book Thomas 
and Beulah, for which she won 
the Pulitzer Prize, and how that
particular piece of work came to 
be.
Her lecture also included some 
scenes of her new video, Thomas 
and Beulah and the difficulties 
that arose from putting prose 
into visual.
For Dove, seeing the video is 
extemely painful because, she 
says, It seems so public and 
glitzy. She feels different about 
the poems. These are the ones 
that she reads in the quiet of her 
room.
Thomas and Beulah chronicles 
the life of her grandparents, who 
were part of the great movement 
of southern blacks to the north in 
the beginning of the 20th cen
tury.
The video is divided into two 
sections. The first begins with 
Thomas as a young man, travel
ing north eventually to Akron, 
Ohio. There he meets and marriesBeulah. The secondparttells
Beulahs story and their life to
gether.
Rita Dove is originally from 
Akron, Ohio where she was edu
cated at Miami University in 
Oxford, Ohio. She later received 
her MFA in creative writing 
from the Iowa Writers Work
shop.
Her first collection of poems, 
The Yellow House on the Corner, 
was published by the Carnegie 
Mellon University Press in 
1980. It was followed by Mu
seum in 1983 and Thomas and 
Beulah in 1986.
In addition, Dove has been 
awarded fellowships from the 
National Endowment for the 
arts and the Guggenheim foun
dation.
Dove now teaches at the Uni
versity of Virginia and lives in 
Charlottesville with her hus
band, novelist Fred Viebhan 
and their daughter.
Undoing the damage of rape: a survivors untold story
continued from page LI
she chose to remain at school 
uy amidst constant reminders of her 
... ordeal. There are no statistics on 
;< the number of college rape vic1 tims who continue at their schools,
 but considering the shroud of sirlence that surrounds rape, there
 are probably many women out 
there who share Annes secret.
Barb Benser, Programming 
i Director at Pittsburgh Action 
 Against Rape (PAAR), explained 
that, sometimes a victim doesnt 
come back. On the other hand, 
Benser does come in contact with 
some victims who have stayed, 
p Its so hard when youre in 
S school, said Benser, you may 
! not want to tell your friends because they might place the blame 
; on you. Many victims of rape 
; perceive the crime as having been 
; their fault, and subsequently they 
| are not believed when they seek 
| help. This is just part of the 
; reason that women leave school 
j after such an incident. According 
to Benser, the victim really needs 
to find a resource. 
i Benser listed a few of the more
! common reactions a young woman
 may experience after a rape, 
I though the reactions are varied.
J The fundamental thing that the 
! young women face is regaining 
! their trust. According to Benser,
' trust is hard. Most of the time
* she is raped by someone she
knows. After she may not trust 
men, or trust the nighttime if it 
occured then. Benser went on to 
explain that some girls will even 
experience fear around the time 
of day that the rape occured. A 
girl will often also find it difficult 
to concentrate and her grades will 
drop, or she will have difficulty 
sleeping and will then sleep 
through her classes during the 
day because she cant sleep at 
night.
Sometimes the perpetrator may 
live on the floor of the victims 
dorm, or may be in one of her 
classes. The anxiety this causes 
can be paralyzing, explained 
Benser.
In some cases girls may turn to 
alcohol or drugs to blot out the 
pain, while others become worka
holics in order to compensate. 
Their network of friends may 
abruptly change, especially if the 
perpetrator was part of the group, 
which may increase the sense of 
isolation. Benser finished her list 
saying, she has to learn to make 
decisions again.
Annes story illustrates many 
of these elements. She recounts 
that, right after my accident I 
needed to be baby-sat. Id forget 
to eat and sleep and I got really 
wild. I drank a lot and I went to a 
lot of parties. She went through 
periods of nervous energy, that 
kept her from getting school work
accomplished, as well as getting 
sleep. Anne found that there was 
little escape from her nightmare.
Anne was lucky because the 
CMU campus is progressive in 
recognition of the rape problem. 
Representatives from PAAR help 
train the resident assistants. The 
organization also holds a program 
on rape at Freshman orientation 
in order to educate the incoming 
students that rape is a possibil
ity.
Annes RA directed her to the 
campus counseling center and 
alerted the administration to the 
incident. Dean Lois Cox met with 
Anne and together they outlined 
her academic possibilities. Anne 
was given the option of taking a 
leave of absence for the semester 
or taking some time off to go home 
and return to school where she 
would be given an indefinite ex
tension on her work.
Anne went home for a while to 
heal, returning to school without 
the academic pressure or expec
tations from her professors. Sur
prisingly enough, her best grades 
were that semester.
Many universities will not rec
ognize that rape occurs on their 
campus. As Benser put it, the 
universities dont want to admit 
that theres a problem. No stu
dents, no money.
In an unusual twist, Carnegie 
Mellon admitted there was a
problem and did something about 
it, but the city of Pittsburgh was 
reluctant to take action.
At the hospital a policeman ap
proached Anne to interview her. 
In her fear and confusion she felt 
threatened and refused to speak. 
Later, when she contacted the 
detective who was in charge of 
her case, he explained that the 
rape evidence had been taken 
under protest from Anne, and 
since she hadnt spoken to the 
police that night, starting an 
investigation would be difficult. 
Also, the detective explained that 
Anne could prove nothing. The al
leged rape happened at a frater
nity house at a prestigious uni
versity involving underaged
drinking, so according to the de
tective, there was no way Anne 
was going to have a winning case 
in court.
Returning for her sophomore 
year was not as easy for Anne as 
deciding to finish out her fresh
man year. I was really unsure 
about coming back, she said,  
but I did. Then I didnt know if I 
was going to be able to stay or not. 
I liked CMU. My friends were 
here. Its a good school. I guess I 
just wanted to prove that I wasnt 
going to fail. I wanted to be OK, 
like nothing ever happened.
It was during her sophomore 
year that Anne experienced aca
demic problems, due to what she 
feels was a lack of self control to
really study. Incidents like the 
anniversary of the rape where 
she spent the night crying while 
waiting for the sun to rise, Se
cured during this very trying 
period.
Anne is doing well at CMU now. 
Her grades may not be the top of 
her class, but just surviving the 
nightmare that college can be is 
a greater feat than the highest 
QPA. As she put it, Ive survived 
and Im pretty human again.
Benser echoed these wordsby\ 
saying, Women and victims can 
survive. They need to know where 
the help is and how to heal. There 
is always going to be a scar, al
ways a sad part. Rape is an over
whelming bad feeling.
Groups address victim concerns
continued from page LI
percent of the Centers cases are 
elderly victims. Allegheny County 
has the second largest elderly 
population in the nation.
Prevention is the key to avoid
ing becoming a part of these sta
tistics. One cannot avoid becom
ing a victim, but you can reduce 
your chances, Campbell says. Be 
aware  a lot of this happens 
because people are not aware or 
paying attention.
Use common sense and good 
judgement  stay on the lighted
side of the street, move with 
someone, and walk in a confident 
manner. Park your car in popu
lated areas and leave packages in 
the trunk or out of view. If you are 
a woman living alone, dont list 
your first name in the phone book 
or on your mailbox.
Sloan advises, if approached, 
be assertive ... say no and mean 
it. She adds, dont be afraid to 
cause a scene; do whatever you 
need to do to stay alive.
If you do become a victim of vio
lent crime, Campbell says, you
must report it to the police. And, 
as Sloan adds, remember that its. 
never the victims fault. Also, 
remember that youre not alone.
But no matter how many cases 
they take or calls they answer, 
Sloan admits having groups like 
PAAR, the Center for Victims, 
and Family Resources doesnt 
make the problem go away .... It 
cant. Asked if the time will ever 
come when her organization, 
PAAR, will no longer be needed, 
she answered, I hope so, but I 
dont think it will.

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  3 October 198SL3
Holy plum pudding; Batman invades Great Britain!
By J. GRELLO-MABXUACH
Tartan Staffwriter
Britain ... Home of Shake
speare, snow, Stratford upon 
Avon, Victorian morality, and
Matthew Arnolds angst-ridden 
meditations upon the white cliffs 
of Dover. Needless to say, I was 
far less th an delighted wh en upon 
arriving at the city of London I 
saw IT. What is IT? You may 
ask. The IT I am referring to is 
that dark evil which consumed 
the United States during the sum
mer of 1989 and has now cor
rupted the heart of England as 
well. I first chanced upon IT when 
stepping onto a platform on the 
London underground. I looked up 
and there IT was, staring at me in 
naked, bare-faced defiance, mock
ing me, open like the very maw of 
Hell itself.
The Batman Logo.
Yes, I regret to report that I 
could not run fast enough. Bat
man has beaten me across the 
ocean. The same reckless bad taste
which made the film such a megagargantuan success in the states 
is now working its fool corruption 
in the United Kingdom. As Queen 
Victoria herself would say, We 
are not amused.
In order to escape from Bat
man, the eight members of the 
program Im attending journeyed 
to Wales, whfere the Batman has 
yet to appear, although the logo is 
beginning to pop up like one of the 
germ-laden pustules which often 
foreshadow the onset of small
pox.
Upon arriving in mid-Wales, we 
were greeted by our host families, 
members of all walks of life who 
graciously opened their doors to a 
slew of potentially psychotic 
Americans. My first sight was that 
of the two children in my host

National Coming Out day is coming up
By JOEY LYNN MONACO
Tartan Features Editor
Vince Matsko is comfortable 
beinggay, buthe acknowledges 
that many young gays and les
bians have difficulty when they 
first decide to come out to their 
family and friends. In order to 
provide some support for the 
Carnegie Mellon gay and les
bian population, he has organ
ized thefestivitiesforthisyears 
celebration of National Coming 
Out Day.
According to Matsko, Na
tional Coming Out Day, Octo
ber 11, was declared two years 
ago; he read about it in anewsletterfrom Parents and Friends 
of Lesbians And Gays, and de
cided that, this year, the event 
should be marked on the Car
negie Mellon campus.
National Coming Out Day at 
CMU is supported by GALA and 
the residence hall staff. There will 
also be a residence staff develop
ment session next week to de
velop an RAs capacity to relate to 
gay or lesbian students, even if it 
is knowing when to send them to 
someone else who may have more 
experience and knowledge to 
share about the gay or lesbian ex
perience.
The main purpose of National 
Coming Out Day is to encourage 
people to come out in their own 
way, Matsko explained. He has 
designed several programs to help 
gays and lesbians feel good about 
themselves. On Tuesday night, 
October 3, at 8 pm in Breed Hall, 
The Times of Harvey Milk, a film 
exploring gay activism, will air, 
courtesy of the Political Speakers 
Forum Board.
On Wednesday from 10 am to 4 
pm, GALA and the residence staff 
will have tables in Skibo with 
pamphlets and pins for students 
who want to show support for or 
be supported about being gay or 
lesbian. From 3 pm to 6 pm that 
evening, graduate student 
Nathan Long will present a radio 
program on WRCT about Coming 
Out Day and gay issues.
Finally, on Wednesday at 8 pm, 
in Mudge Lounge, there will be a 
panel activity in which the audi
ence must try to guess the sexual 
preferences of each panel partici
pant by asking questions. A 
moderator will make sure that 
the questions are not too leading: 
asking a person who the last 
person they went out with was 
might be a little telling. Matsko 
hopes that this program will 
challenge and ultimately dispel
peoples stereotypes about being 
gay or lesbian.
Matsko stresses thatyoudont 
have to be lesbian or gay to 
attend National Coming Out 
Day festivities. You might have 
a friend who is lesbian or gay, 
since a significant portion of 
the CMU community is. Or you 
might just be curious about 
what it means to be lesbian or 
gay. In the future, he hopes 
that National Coming Out Day 
will continue to be a celebra
tion of sexuality, gay, lesbian, 
or straight.
Students wanting to partici
pate in rap groups about the 
gay or lesbian experience or with 
further questions can call Vince 
Matsko at 361-1829. GALA 
meetings are held on Fridays at 
7:30 pm in Skibo 13.
saw plenty of farmland, cows, 
sheep, and men in oilskins trudg
ing about the moors in their 
Wellingtons to counteract the 
shock of having been cast into the 
urban heart of London. Of course, 
mid-Wales wasnt all oilskins, 
Wellies, and bovine-laden pas
tures. Maybe it is because as 
Americans we seem to prefer 
neatly packaged goods, but those 
who were expecting the some-allpurpose-rural-homeland-paradise-just-add-water were more 
than surprised at finding an over
whelming preponderance of sat
ellite dishes, vidoecassette record
ers, compact disc players, and digi
tal watches.
Speaking of which, the British 
seem to have solved the problem 
of satellite dishes the size of Ohio 
uglifying the suburbs: here the 
satellite dishes are less than three 
feet in diameter and are no more 
of an eyesore than the state of 
Rhode Island.
In any event, the juxtaposition 
(a nice word for you English ma
jors) of the myth of the yeoman 
farmer (the local dairy owner 
herding his cows into a shed for 
their daily milking) and the socalled high tech conveniences of 
life (the fact that the local dairy 
owner was a week away from 
boarding a 747 for a holiday in 
Las Vegas) added up to a some
what surreal landscape. Indeed, 
sitting in a Welsh pub, listening 
to two men belting out Alabamas
greatest hits with the help of twin 
Roland synthesizers, called for a 
major reality check, and a rede
sign for a neatly packaged real
ity.
The greatest source of cultural 
shock for this innocent abroad lay 
in comingto terms with the Welsh 
language. Being completely igno
rant in these matters, I assumed 
that Welsh referred merely to 
an accent or dialect which would 
be no harder to understand than 
the way Londoners speak. By the 
way, forget the George Bernard 
Shaw cliche of America and Eng
land being two countries sepa
rated by a common languagein 
fact, I wish someone would call a 
moratorium on the use of that 
expression. If I had a dime for 
every time some wit-starved 
school official study abroad rep
resentative/group coordinator/ 
janitor dredged out this tired old 
chestnut in order to justify the 
fact that some people  Ameri
can and English alike  are too 
boneheaded to actually listen to 
one another, I would still get 
shafted on the exchange rate.
In any case, upon arriving at 
Welshpool, I found that my pre
conceptions about the Welsh lan
guage were dreadfully off base. 
For example, in Welsh, the name 
Welshpool translates to 
Trallnqg, which is pronounced 
feh-thmn-ggchj.  Although all of 
my efforts to find a common 
ground from which to understand 
Welsh came to a frustrating end, 
I did cave in and buy a post card 
bearing th legend Cofyon o 
Gymru. I have it on good faith 
that this does mean Greetings 
from Wales and not Im a stupid 
American who shelled out a buck 
and a quarter for this postcard.
Thankfully, I have not yet dis
covered the Welsh term for BatSave this ad for future reference.

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  3 October 1989
Crime on CMU campus: 
more than just thefts
continued from page L2
years (1985-1988) involved theft. 
In 1988, there was an average of 
28.75 thefts per month reported 
to Campus Security.
Director of Security of Campus 
Police James LaPaglia believes 
that most of these thefts are due 
to carelessness on the part of the 
victims. Indeed, many of the 
stolen items have been left out in 
the open or in unlocked offices.
A notion that is ingrained in 
many people is that they can tell 
from someones appearance if they 
are up to no good, but LaPaglia 
emphasized that almost anyone 
could be guilty of the crimes. 
These crimes were probably 
committed by staff, students, or 
employees of the university, he 
said. Therefore, he urges that the 
campus community take no 
chances by leaving belongings 
unattended or unlocked.
Recently there has been a prob
lem with stolen bicycles, the most 
recent incident occurring last 
Wednesday in Wean Hall. La
Paglia recommends that bike 
owners be especially careful.
Although the number of bur
glaries here has decreased in the 
last few years, a small epidemic 
has cropped up in recent months 
in off-campus housing. The loca
tion with the most problems is 
Carol Apartments, which has 
been burglarized five times over 
the past four months.
Residents of Carol do not feel 
safe, and those who were robbed 
complain that the security sys
tem is not sufficient. Entry in four 
of these crimes was through a 
window, and the fifth was com
mitted simply by forcing open a 
locked door. At the beginning of 
the semester, housing installed a 
new paging system in the build
ing. Visitors page the room that 
they want to visit and can be 
buzzed in by that room.
Carol resident Aileen Jaitin 
likens the new system to putting 
band aids on a broken leg, refer
ring to the fact that anyone can 
page a room, claim that the per
son they are trying to reach is 
busy. If the person doesnt want 
to bother walking downstairs, 
they can just buzz the visitor in 
without leaving their room. She 
and other residents advocate the 
installation of a campus phone 
outside of the building, minus the 
buzzer system.
Since this paging system was 
installed, another apartment in 
Carol was robbed, approximately 
two weeks ago. LaPaglia stated 
that Campus Police is looking 
closely at the situation and will 
soon make recommendations for 
possible action to the Housing 
Office.
More deadly crimes are a very 
real threat to students walking 
off-campus at night. Three seri
ous assaults occurred last year in 
Oakland. None have occurredyet 
this year, but LaPaglia is sure 
that a serious crime will happen 
before the year is out.
Schenley Park, right next door 
to CMU and a popular place for 
joggers, turns into an extremely 
dangerous place at night. Every 
year there are numerous reports 
of rapes and murders. The most

recent incident involved the slay
ing of a man in the middle of the 
night.
Schenley Park is the perfect 
place to commit crimes, said 
LaPaglia. As a secluded place in 
an urban area, it invites crime. 
Due to its seclusion, violent crimes 
committed at night will usually 
not be discovered until the follow
ing day, giving the perpetrator 
plenty of time to get away.
LaPaglia said that when he is 
in Schenley Park in the evening, 
he always sees people walking 
alone. These people, according to 
LaPaglia, are rapes or murders 
waiting to happen. After dark, 
Schenley becomes a hotbed of 
serious crime, and students 
should actively avoid it.
There are many thefts that go 
unreported, LaPaglia believes. 
This is probably because the vic
tims dont feel that it is worth the 
trouble to report it to Campus 
Police. LaPaglia disagrees. Even 
if we cannot help the victim re
gain lost items, we can at least 
circulate word of possible danger 
to the rest of the campus.
Campus groups that are probably 
unknown to most CMU students
By JASON LEE SMITH
Tartan Staffwriter
You may not know that there 
are a lot of small organizations 
operating at here at Carnegie 
Mellon.
These groups may not be as 
visible or as well-known as 
groups such as the Activities 
Board, or Student Dormitory
Council, but they are, nonethe
less, an integral part of life here 
at good ol* CMU. Indeed, theyre 
a part of life which we have all 
grown to depend upon over the 
years.
For instance, where would any 
of us be without the good people 
at the Friends of the Left-Handed, 
the Roommate Assassination 
Squad, or the Society For Those 
With Intellectual Pretensions, 
just to name a few?
I graciously volunteered, for a 
modest fee, to allow the powersthat-be to use my column to print 
the gratifyingly large number of 
messages which we have received 
from the small-organizational 
community here at Carnegie 
Mellon. Here they are in their 
entirety:
The League of Incompetents 
has two messages.
The Society of Collegiate In

newest discovery  chimney 
fresheners. Place one chimney
freshner in the flue of any conven

your entire chimney area for up to 
nine months. Shove one up yours, 
today.

Macsurak celebrates 40 
years of good memories in 
the Registrars office
By TARA M. SEMAN
Tartan Staffwriter
Few people can imagine work
ing at a job for ten years, let alone 
40. Neither did Lillian Macsurak 
she she started working in CMUs 
Registrars Office 40 years ago.
After graduation from CMU 
with a degree in social work, she 
was offered a job in the Registrars 
Office, which was then located in 
Baker Hall. She decided to try it. 
She liked it and stayed for so long 
because the people are like a 
family.
Macsurak has seen many 
changes over the years at CMU. 
Some of the changes include: 
the construction of Doherty Hall, 
Warner Hall, and Wean Hall; 
the building of Skibo on what 
used to be a large hill, and dor
mitories; Machinery Hall being 
renamed Hamerschlag Hall; 
Baker Hall being given two 
names, Baker Hall and Porter 
Hall; an increase in the number 
of departments; and the con
solidation of Carnegie Tech and 
Mellon Institute. Though she 
has witnessed many changes at
CMU, Macsurak feels that the in
troduction of the computer into 
everyday life is the most impor
tant. It has made her duties much 
easier; she admits, I wouldnt want 
to go back to the way it was. 
Macsurak feels that working at 
CMU is different from business. 
Her basic attitude is do the best 
you can with what you have.
The Registrars Office held a re
ception for Macsurak on Friday, 
September 22 in honor of her 40 
years of fine service. Friends and 
collgues gathered share the occa
sion with her.

Big Brother is watching you, only this time, hes nice
By ERIC J. McANALLEN
Tartan Staffwriter
Imagine that youre an only 
child, thirteen years old, full of 
spunk and spontaneity, and ready 
to conquer the world. Youre just 
like any other kid. You have your 
dreams, hopes, and wishes, but 
life has thrown you a curve ball. 
For whatever reason, you only 
have one parent and times are 
hard. There is no one to share 
your innermost dreams and com
fort your fears, no one to throw a 
baseball back and forth; until, 
one day, you get a big brother.
He spends time with you, takes 
you places, plays games with you, 
but most of all, he takes the time 
to get to know you for who you 
really are. He believes in you and 
you trust him. Although hes not
your real brother, he has brought 
joy into your life and that has 
made all the difference.
Big Brothers and Big Sisters 
is a worthwhile organization 
that brings such joy to children 
all over the nation. By provid
ing companionship to the less 
fortunate children of our soci
ety, they have shed some light 
throughout the community.
The Carnegie Mellon chapter 
of Big Brother and Big Sisters 
was formed two years ago by 
then-junior Fred Goff after one 
of his brothers at SAE proposed 
that they become Big Brothers 
through the regular program. 
This put the idea in Goffs head 
and over the summer he thought 
of starting a campus program. 
He called Iris Nahemo, who 
negotiated with Dean of Stu
dent Affairs Brad Walter to start a 
program on campus. Afterwards, 
they ran an ad campaign and re
cruited members.
The club itself is a separate self
funded entity, as Goff contests, 
Were very autonomous as far as 
our club goes.... They (Big Brothers 
and Big Sisters) do the matching 
and screening. As far the club as
pect, thats all done by us.
When asked about the expansion 
of his organization, Goff replied, 
Weve been working for two years 
and I still havent gone through 
Senate. Now, were in the process of 
applying for formal recognition as 
a funded group.... Were a growing 
program.
Being an autonomous organiza
tion, Carnegie Mellons Big Broth
ers and Big Sisters rely on self
funding and on contributions from
other organizations. On this point, 
Goff explained how the Carnegie 
Mellon Greek society has helped 
with the funding of the organiza
tion. Greeks donated over four 
thousand dollars last year raised 
from Greek Sing and bowl-athons. As Goff said, The Greeks 
have been excellent!
Tom Tomkins, the caseworker 
for Big Brothers and Big Sisters, 
described the kind of kids involved 
in the program as the older, non
problematic kids who would be 
interested in the campus. 
Tomkins states, Fred [Goff] was 
trying to do something for the 
kids on campus. On our end, we 
were trying to do something with 
the kids who were hard to match.... 
A lot of these kids are from eco
nomically depressed areas where 
guys cannot volunteer because
theyre trying to get their own act 
together.
Tomkins went on to stress how 
important it was for a Big Brother 
or a Big Sister to be commited to 
the program and their Little. The 
most important thing a kid needs 
is consistency, emphasized 
Tomkins.
I was fortunate enough to have 
the pleasure of spending part of 
the afternoon with Kevin, Ste
ven, and Vince, some of the Little 
Brothers. They are fun loving, 
ordinary kids. When asked what 
kind of activities they did, they 
responded in unison, video 
games! According to their Big 
Brothers, they usually do much 
more than video games, but kids 
will be kids.
I asked them what they though 
of their Big Brothers. Kevin re
plied, jokingly, [Theyre] a bad; 
influence. But after some consid
eration and the threat of being 
dropped in the mud, Kevin] 
changed his mind, saying, All of! 
thems good guys!
Tomkins summed up the program perfectly, Youre there to; 
talk to them, try to build up a: 
relationship.... Hopefully you; 
develop a relationship where you; 
can talk. Thats really what the; 
programs about. Its not abouti 
video games, its not about past 
activities, and thats a wonderful' 
way to help a kid one on one.

cFb s8ouog5u A Midsummer Nights Dream
By DAWN BROSONSKI
Tartan Asst. Diversions Editor
A magical evening of love and 
fantasy highlights the celebration 
ofthe Pittsburgh Ballet Theatres 
20th anniversary with the pro
duction of A Midsummer Nights 
Dream.
Based on Shakespeares classic 
comedy of the same name, Mid
summer will open the Pittsburgh 
Ballet Theatre season Octoberl2 
to 16 at the Benedum Center.
Theballet fuses the natural with 
the supernatural as the tribula
tions of two pairs of mortal lovers 
are further complicated when 
Oberon, king of the fairies, and 
his assistant, the mischievous 
Puck, attempt to become match
makers. Oberons queen, Titania, 
and a rustic actor, Bottom, also 
fall into the fantasy and foolery.
Breathing magical life into this 
production is the PBTs first resi
dent choreographer, Bruce Wells. 
He was recently appointed PBTs 
choreographer in residence and 
ballet master by Artistic Director 
Patricia Wilde. Wells choreo
graphs ballets for the mainstage 
season and sets his works and 
those of other choreographers for 
the 36-member company. His 
other responsibilities include 
rehearsing ballets and teaching 
company class.
Wells dance career began when 
he joined George Balanchines 
New York City Ballet in 1967. 
After three years Balanchine 
promoted him to soloist. His first 
performance was The Firebird, 
with Patricia Wilde in the title 
role.
Even with the fulfillment of 
being a dancer, Wells was con
sumed by a passion for choreog
raphy. Upon leavingtheNew York 
City Ballet, Wells joined the 
Connecticut Ballet as a principal 
dancer and choreographer. Dur
ing the four years he spent there, 
he created over 20 ballets.
In 1979 Wells entered an Inter
national Choreographic Compe
tition begun by the Boston Ballet. 
It was there that Wells ap/qqrAu comedy has endured for centu
ries. It's about eternal love and all of 
the mistakes we make along the way 
.... In driu4..o8 I want to take the 
audience on an enchanted romp 
through a magical forest filled with 
spirits and surprises.
B Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre 
Ballet Master Bruce Wells
proached Artistic Director Vir
ginia Williams about choreo
graphing. She in turn offered him 
the position of principal dancer 
with the opportunity to choreo
graph. Wells went on to serve as 
principal teacher, resident chore
ographer, interim artistic direc
tor, and finally, associate artistic 
director.
Now Wells has found his home 
at the PBT. He began his work 
here by setting and rehearsing A 
Midsummer Nights Dream with 
the Company. Wells previously 
staged his reworking of Midsum
mer twice for the Boston Ballet to 
critical and public acclaim.
This comedy has endured for 
centuries. Its about eternal love 
and all of the mistakes we make 
along the way, says Wells. In 
Midsummer I want to take the 
audience on an enchanted romp 
through a magical forest filled 
with spirits and surprises.
A unique aspect of Midsummer 
is the casting of 30 children from 
the PBT school. They will appear 
as fairies, sprites, and elves that 
will ignite the stage with youth
ful spark and vitality. I love chil
dren, says Wells. I wanted Mid
summer to be a fall Nutcracker. 
Theyre part of the charm, part of 
what makes it a family ballet.
The musical score for Midsum
mer was composed by Jakob 
Ludwig Felix Mendelssohn, the 
best-known numbers being the 
Overture .Nocturne, Scherzo, and
the Wedding March. Wells added 
music to drive the dramatic ac
tion in the second act. In addition, 
the Mendelssohn Choir will lend 
its sweet voice to Midsummer's 
score.
The costumes for Midsummer 
were built at Boston Ballet under 
the watchful eye of Bostons cos
tumier, Paul Plesch. The costumes 
are constructed primarily from 
natural materials, including silk, 
satin, velvet, and lace. Of special 
interest are the costumes of the 
characters Oberon and Titani^, 
which are made of gold lam and 
iridescent chiffon, respectively. In 
addition, they feature 25-foot 
capes flowing from gigantic fairy 
wings.
The PBT looks forward to es
tablishing a repertoire of works 
nurtured and created within its 
own ranks and choreographed 
especially for its dancers, begin
ning with the October openingjof 
Midsummer. Wilde has plans fa> 
unveil the Pittsburgh premiere'of 
another work by Wells during the 
Companys mainstage season.
A Midsummer Nights Dream 
will be presented at the Benedum 
Center October 12 to 16 at 8 pm, 
with a 2 pm matinee performance 
on October 15. Join the Pittsburgh 
Ballet Theatre as it begins its 
20th season with mystical gran
deur.

Carnegie Mellon Drama prepares for new season
As actors, we appreciate it more 
when students our own age say they 
[attended shows] and they liked it.
B Brett Benner
In classes, were not just sitting.
We have dance classes, voice 
classes. You have to move. 
B Michael McElroy
By TERRI KASCH
Tartan Staffwriter
To celebrate the 75th anniver
sary of the Drama Department at 
Carnegie Mellon, student actors 
have been busy creating a gift  
actually, several gifts  for the 
entire university.
Director Bernard Hopkins kicks 
off the departments mainstage 
season at the Kresge Theatre with 
Shakespeares As You Like It on 
October 12. Fresh from the Strat
ford Shakespeare Festival in 
Canada, Hopkins is making his 
Carnegie Mellon directorial de
but.
Hopkins has also worked as an 
actor in the past. This lets him re
late more closely to the students 
that he directs. As Don Marinelli, 
the assistant head of the depart
ment, explains, He brings the 
understanding of an actor to the 
play. He directs it and speaks it in 
the language of an actor.
Language is a special concern 
of the cast of As You Like It. Sen
ior Michael McElroy, who plays 
Oliver, says that dealing with 
Shakespeares language and 
trying to make it sound natural 
presents an extra challenge for 
an actor.
Classmate Brett Benner agrees. 
He says, Its harder to keep an 
audiences attention [with 
Shakespeare].
Both McElroy and Benner hope 
to get the attention of more Car
negie Mellon students this year. 
Theres so much stuff that people 
could find entertaining, says 
Benner. Students are a desirable 
audience for CFAs many shows,
ranging from one-acts in the 
Studio Theatre (the small con
crete building behind CFA) to full 
scale plays presented in the 
Kresge.
If the quality of the productions 
is first-rate, then the prices are 
certainly cut-rate. Some main
stage shows feature student tick
ets for around $5, and deans of
fices from H&SS and CIT often 
buy large blocks of tickets that 
are available free to students in 
their colleges. The Studio The
atre also presents smaller pro
ductions that are free to the 
campus community. According to 
Benner, As actors, we appreciate 
it more when students our own 
age say they [attended shows] and 
they liked it.
Bright Lights, Long Hours
Although the tickets may be 
inexpensive, each show requires 
a great deal of effort from student 
performers, designers, and tech
nicians. Often, drama majors
attend classes from 8:30 in the 
morning to 4:30 in the afternoon 
with few breaks, and then report 
to rehearsals that last well into 
the night. If the campus impres
sion of drama students is one of 
aloof and severe people, perhaps 
thats due in large part to the fact 
that drama majors hardly have 
time to socialize outside the de
partment.
McElroy points out another key 
difference between the students 
in the drama department and 
those in other majors. In classes, 
were not just sitting. We have 
dance classes, voice classes. You 
have to move.
Its not like a lecture, Benner 
says. You cant just sit in the 
back and veg.
McElroy recalls that last year 
he participated in Greek Sing 
along with fraternity members. 
He enjoyed it immensely because 
it gave him a chance to be with 
people outside of the theater 
world. I still hang out there. It 
changed my stereotype about

fraternities and I think we 
changed their stereotype about 
dramats, says McElroy.
Drama majors at CMU hold a 
strong sense of identity regard
ing how they compare to other 
drama schools across the coun
try. According to Marinelli, this is 
due to the departments sense of 
living tradition. Theres a whole 
sense of being the oldest, and so 
successful. Its palpable. You can 
feel it. It feeds the students.
McElroy remembers being at
tracted to specific qualities pos
sessed by CMU. You get the 
conservatory training  intense 
training  and you also get the 
university life.
After As You Like It ends on 
October 28, the actors will have 
twelve days to finish rehearsing 
for a new musical revue by Billy 
Wilson before its opening. Wilson, 
an accomplished Broadway star 
who directed last years enor
mously successful Broadway 
Cabaret for the drama depart
ment, will also direct this produc
tion.
In March, the Kresge Theater 
will present three works by 
Samuel Beckett, including his 
famous Waiting For Godot. Fi
nally, April brings The House Of 
Bernarda Alba, a drama by con
temporary Spanish playwright 
Federico Garcia Lorca.
The intense energy that each 
actor brings to the stage will make 
these shows a must-see for any
one who can appreciate an eve
ning of excellent entertainment.

Working in the glass booth and hearing the or
gasmic sounds emanating from the screen, Christine 
starts to pursue her voyeuristic urges... Judging 
from this excerpt from Variety's press release, one 
might be led to believe that he or she is in for 97 
minutes of salacious entertainment. Wrong. Direc
tor Bette Gordon takes the conventional views of 
pornography to task in this controversial chronicle 
of a New York porn theater ticket-vendors life.
Christine, the new employee at the Variety thea
ter, is at first indignant about the smut she sells 
tickets for, but she eventually warms up to pornog
raphy, seeing it as a coming to terms with her 
sexuality. The revelation shocks the men in her life, 
not to mention the womens anti-pornography groups 
who were incensed by this films treatment of the 
topic. This is not light entertainment. Those in the 
mood for intelligent cinema will find it provocative 
and satisfying.

Monty Pythons Meaning of 
Life
Every sperm is sacred, sings a chorus of Catho
lic children, but very little else is in what Newsweek 
lauded as Monty Pythons best movie to date. This 
time around the blasphemous Brits attack and 
maim topics and taboos such as sex, religion, the 
military, and organ donation. Some will be repulsed 
and offended by scenes graphically depicting child
birth and vomiting (heavy vomiting), but the reward 
is getting a peek at Pythons idea of what heaven is 
like. Like the classic BBC television show, segments 
flow into one another without warning and the 
effect is still a hoot. Humor for the sophisticated 
boor.

Casino Royale
This attempt to satirize the James Bond series of 
Spy flicks falls short of its mark. Even a cast that 
includes David Niven, Peter Sellers, Woody Allen, 
:and Ursula Andress cannot save this film. Andress 
was unfavorably compared to an olive pit in the 
original Time magazine reviewTasteless but un
avoidable. Niven plays a retired Sir James Bond 
who is coaxed out of his county seat and into action, 
most of which is contrived and silly slapstick. Ca
sino Royale does provide a chortle or two, but noth
ing of substance. Save the dollar for some real satire 
with next Sundays Bananas.

City Theatre celebrates sixteen years
By RAJESK V. PUTCHA
Tartan Staffwriter
City Theatres artistic director, 
Marc Masterson, hopes to have a 
sweet year as City Theatre opens 
its sixteenth season. With some 
of the finest plays City Theatre 
has shown in past years, Master
son cannot wait to blow out the 
candles on opening night.
The first play will be David 
Mamets American Buffalo. It 
previews October 4 through Octo
ber 8, opens on October 11 and 
will run until November 5.
Mamets plays are paragons of 
critical acclaim; the first Broad
way production of American Buf
falo won him the New York Drama 
Critics Circle Award for best 
American play and an off-Broadway production won him the Obie 
Award.
The first in a trilogy of works 
that aim at the heart of American 
business ethics, American Buffalo 
explores the difficulties faced by 
three petty criminals in planning 
a robbery. Such a simple plot 
gripped by caustic humor, nailbiting tension, absurd follies, and 
down and dirty language makes 
for a most enjoyable play.
The other plays in his trilogy 
are Glenngarry Glen Ross, for 
which he won the Pulitzer Prize, 
andtherecentBroadway success, 
Speed-The-Plow. Masterson says, 
Our last production of a Mamet

play [Glenngarry Glen Ross in 
1986] was a landmark for City 
Theatre. I felt it was time for 
another professional production 
of a Mamet piece in Pittsburgh, 
and Ive wanted to do American 
Buffalo for a long time.
George C. Wolfes The Colored 
Museum appears next on the list 
of plays this season. It opens for 
previews November 15 through 
November 19, opens on Novem
ber 22 and it runs through De
cember 17. Wolfe is a recipient of 
the CBS/Foundation of the 
Dramatist Guild Playwriting 
Award for The Colored Museum 
in 1986 and funny enough that 
New York Times reviewer Frank 
Rich says, Wolfe says the un
thinkable, says it with uncompro
mising wit, and leaves the audi
ence in ruins.
The Colored Museum takes on a 
Spike Lee attitude as it magnifies 
black and white stereotypes into 
such colossal proportions as to 
render them funny. The cast is 
simple, consisting of just five 
actors who play over twenty roles 
combined in this hilarious play.
Third on the list of plays is Jaime 
Meyers Harry and Claire, pre
viewing January 24 through 
January 28, opening January 31 
and running through February 
25. Masterson is very excited 
about this play, stating that it is 
irresistibly funny. Its the per
fect play for City Th eatre  fresh,
original, offbeat. Meyers credentialsinclude the co-founding with 
playwrights Steven Dietz and 
Kevin Kling Quicksilver Stage in 
Minneapolis.
Harry and Claire concerns 
Harry, a lighthouse keeper who 
does not have all his mental ca
pacities intact, and Claire, his 
blind but clairvoyant wife. The 
disillusioned Harry continually 
finds ways to shed his boring life 
and in the process often assumes 
characters which he would like to 
be but isnt, kind of like The 
Adventures of Walter Mitty. Clair
voyant Claire takes psychic trips 
to other planets in attempts to 
quell her boredom.
The play gets even more bi
zarre when they encounter a talk
ing fish, a sex-craved waitress, 
and a rowdy, brawl-crazed com
panion in a helium balloon. Add 
all this up and you get ahilarious, 
pseudo-realistic comedy with 
some very strange characters 
thrown in.
City Theatre tickets are $10 to 
$16 for single seats are $32 to $51 
for season subscriptions. Perform
ance times for the season will be 8 
pm Wednesday throughFriday, 6 
pm and 9 pm on Saturday, and a

Theatre is located in B-39, Cathe

Relax, Eurythmics fans. This 
group recently switched record 
companies, but they havent lost 
a bit of that unique sound that 
makes them so appealing. We Too 
Are One marks the bands debut 
^with Arista records. Their latest 
effort expands upon their earlier 
styles while adding new sounds 
to their repertoire.
The Eurythmics have adapted 
;o the times. Like so many other 
nusical works today, this album 
as a social conscience. Song 
topics include suicide and the
general decadence of society.
One of the best songs on the 
album tells the story of an 
ashamed prostitute. The spooky 
music of Sylvia perfectly com
pliments the inspired but cheer
less lyrics: The finger prints/Of 
strangers/On the ugly bedroom 
floor/Reveal the only traces/Of 
what Sylvia was for.
Singer Annie Lennox typically 
dominates every song while Dave 
Stewart plays the guitar and 
provides back-up vocals. On this 
album, however, there is a de
lightful duet entitled (My My) 
Babys Gonna Cry in which each 
verse is equally divided between
Stewart and Lennox. Stewart 
holds his own impressively with 
his smooth, rich voice that has 
just a touch of a robotic twang.
Revival, the opening track on 
the second side, infuses the al
bum with energy. The Euryth
mics style is pared down, but in 
this song they cut loose with a 
spirited refrain.
Of course, not every song hits 
its mark. Angel employs some 
obscure metaphors such as I 
believed in you/ Like Elvis Presley/ 
Singing live from Las Vegas. Not 
to mention the fact that the tune 
is hardly memorable.
Part of the charm of this collec
tion is the groups use of certain 
creative techniques. In Sylvia, 
seconds of silence separate the 
verses. The final track, When 
The Day Goes Down ends in a 
drawn-out drum roll.
Lennox remains evasive about 
what messages the Eurythmics 
want to express with this album. 
She says, I dont have any reli
gion or philosophy. Im just al
ways asking questions about 
value and the nature of things. 
Our music is... about the friction 
between pain and beauty.
Heres a clear message: Buy the 
album We Too Are One. You wont 
be disappointed.

Mona Lisa
Bob Hoskins makes his breakthrough perform
ance in this 1986 film about a small-time hood who 
wants to do right for himself and his young daugh
ter. Desperate for a job after his release from jail, he 
becomes a driver for Cathy Tyson, a small, thin, 
black tart, as Hoskins describes her. The interplay 
between the two characters and Michael Caines 
character drives this film. Hoskins won the best 
actor award at Cannes for his role, and Tyson and 
Caine are also splendid. The ending of the movie is 
rather abrupt and may seem forced to some, but 
overall its one of the best movies of the 80s.

Take four guys from an insane asylum, one who 
thinks hes a psychiatrist (Christopher Lloyd), one 
who can only talk in baseball lingo (Howard Ziefi), 
one who thinks hes the next savior (Peter Boyle), 
and one who uses violence as a means of expression 
(Michael Keaton), get them lost in New York City, 
and what do you get? A hilarious movie with some 
great acting. If you missed it in the theaters last 
year, go see it when you have the chance. Worth the 
dollar and then some.

Major League
In a nutshell, baseball owner Margaret Whitton 
wants the Cleveland Indians to come in last place so 
she can move them to Miami. She hires the worst 
and most eclectic baseball players in the league. 
They promptly fall into last place and make Whitton 
quite happy. Until the players find out about her 
plan, that is. They become so angry with her that 
they decide to jump up from last place to first place 
so she cant sell the team, (I also have a really nice 
bridge to sell).
Baseball movies usually never fare very well in 
the theaters, and this one is no exception. However, 
Major League does have enough funny moments to 
make it worth a dollar, despite the completely unbe
lievable story.

Bananas
Bananas is the last movie in the AB Woody Allen 
Festival, and one of his best. In this movie, Allen 
cant take the pressures of his life and decides to take 
a vacation in some Central American country. He 
then promptly gets involved with the overthrow of 
the current regime, and becomes the leader of the 
country. If you have seen other Allen movies, you 
can probably figure out the rest.
This movie ties with Sleeper as being his wildest 
and craziest movie to date. It even has Howard 
Cosell giving play-by-play descriptions of an assas
sination and the consummation of Allens marriage. 
Definitely not a movie to be missed.

On October 7, the River City 
Brass Band, under the direction 
of RCBB music director Bob Bernat, will pay tribute to the 200th 
anniversary of the French Revo
lution with a program entitled 
Americans In Paris. Conform
ing to its title, the program offers 
a wide variety of classic works by 
a majority of American compos
ers who were influenced by French 
themes. A strong line-up of widely 
acclaimed pieces will complement 
the focal point of the evening, a 
rendition for brass bands of 
George Gershwins An American 
in Paris.
The band will open with John 
WilliamsLifcerty Fanfare, a piece, 
in the Williams tradition, sure to 
provide enough punch to set the 
proper tone for an evening of fes
tive music. After a string of fan
fares, each member of the audi
ence should be on the edge of his 
respective seat. The crowds en
ergy will then be funnelled into 
an audience sing along of a Gor
don Langford arrangement of La 
Marseillaise, the French national 
anthem. After a series of other 
arousing numbers, the band will 
close the first portion of the pro
gram with the familiar A Carmen 
Fantasy. If the name does not 
ring a bell, perhaps youll recog
nize the melody as the Bad News 
Bears victory song. Whether 
associated with George Bizets 
passionate opera, or with a little 
league win in the Astrodome, the 
piece should serve to keep the 
audiences enthusiasm at a high 
level throughout the intermission.
The second half of the perform
ance will continue the salute of 
the anniversary with a further 
display of American musical 
know-how. The RCBB will grace 
the audience with John Philip 
Sousas Hail to the Spirit of Lib
erty. The March King wrote this 
specifically for the presentation 
of a statue donated to France by 
the children of America for the 
Paris Exposition of 1900. The 
mood will then swing from the 
stately and brilliant splendor of 
Sousa to the rich jazz rhythms of
GershwinsAn American inParis. 
According to its Brooklyn-born 
composer, this imaginative work 
attempts to portray the impres
sions of an American visitor in 
Paris as he strolls about the city, 
listens to the various street noises, 
and absorbs the atmosphere. 
With such classics as Rhapsody 
in Blue and Lady Be Good al
ready under his belt at the time of 
composition, Gershwins prowess 
as a writer of popular music is
certainly manifested in the 
RCBBs feature piece.
After performing another hand
ful of familiar tunes, including 
the jazz standard April in Paris, 
the RCBB will conclude with the 
chill-inducing Marines Hymn. 
For any listeners who still feel no 
chill going down the spine, the 
band will employ the power of 
suggestion with the encore Au
tumn Leaves. Finally, for those 
who would like to leave in the
pink, the Pink Panther Theme 
will be offered as a last resort.
RCBBs Americans In Paris* 
will be presented Saturday at 
Carnegie Music Hall; next Thurs-, 
day, October 12 at Gateway High 
School in Monroeville; and next 
Friday, October 13 at Carson 
Middle School in McCandless, 
North Hills. All performances will, 
begin at 8 pm. Tickets are avail
able by phoning322-RCBB or800-,

The Student Dormitory Coun
cil is sponsoring a clippership 
dance as a part of this years 
Homecomingfestivities. Like last 
year, the theme is Homecoming 
on the River. The dance will take 
place aboard The Gateway Party 
Liner, one of the larger ships of 
the Gateway Clippership fleet.
This years dance will feature 
the local band Room to Move. 
Room to Move is a four piece band 
which has been together for five 
years. The lineup consists of Sean 
McGuire on drums, his brother 
Joe on bass, Taylor Sinclair on 
guitar, and Don Szejk on guitar 
and lead vocals.
Room to Move is often classified 
as a blues band, a tag which isnt 
quite appropriate, according to 
Szejk. He doesnt like being so 
tightly pigeon-holed; he feels that 
people equate blues with slow, 
dirge-like music. Room to Move, 
he insists, plays danceable mu
sic, funk-rock, power soul. 
Roughly a third of the bands set 
la very funky original material. 
The remaining two-thirds are 
covers, covers of tunes that people 
are not familiar with, say s Szejk.
All of the members of Room to 
Move work full time or attend 
; school in addition to performing 
several nights a week. Therefore, 
its not surprising that at times 
their schedules leave them on the

The Upstage Lounge opens once again
By DAN BIDWA
Tartan Senior Staffwriter
Beginning yet another chapter 
in its illustrious history, the 
Upstage Lounge is open once 
again.
Formerly the new wave hang
out of Oakland, the Upstage 
opened up in the early Eighties. 
You could go there and hang out 
with all the cool new-wavers like 
Carl Mullen (then called Joe Sopa, 
so the immigration people 
wouldnt bust on him) and Harry 
The Wire (a Pittsburgh D J, now a 
legend in his own mind, who was 
still unknown and humble, sort 
of, back then). Beer was cheap, 
there were lots of people to laugh 
at, and times were good. (I was 
eleven years old and 200 miles 
away at the time, so this is all 
hearsay, and you know how unre
liable Hear can be.)
The Upstage then became a gay 
bar (as opposed to a hetero bar, 
but nobody ever calls them that).
It wasnt cool to go there any more, 
because most of the earlier crowd 
(or at least the male half) was 
afraid that someone might try to 
pick them up, which would un
doubtedly destroy their mascu
linity in one fell swoop. In addi
tion, the beer wasnt cheap any 
more, but nobody seemed to be 
too concerned. Carl was off being 
the intellectual punk rocker in 
Carsickness, and Harry The Wire 
was getting old somewhere else.
The Upstage stayed notorious 
like that for a while, but then just 
kind of faded out of the public eye 
until it was nothing but that goofy 
awning a few blocks down from
the McDonalds on 
Forbes Avenue. 
(Thats about when 
I came to campus. 
I had no idea what 
the Upstage was, 
except that goofy 
awning a few 
blocks down from 
the McDonalds on 
Forbes.)
Sometime this summer, Pat 
McArdle, of P.J. McArdle Promo
tions, natch, started talking with 
the owners of the Upstage, and 
ended up in some strange sort of 
collaboration. The details of the 
collaboration have yet to be re
vealed, mostly because nobody 
really gives a shit about the de
tails. The end result was yet 
another revamping of the 
Upstages interior, the addition 
of a stage, and some nifty little 
lights in the floor. The renova
tions were met with an astound
ing lack of response, since nobody 
had bothered to tell the general
public that the club had changed 
its focus again, or even that the 
place was open. Things have got
ten a little better. There still hasnt 
been anything like a media blitz, 
but a few newspaper ads have 
been spotted, as well as a couple 
of flyers, so the word is starting to 
get around.
The Upstage is open every night 
for the normal nightclub nonsense 
starting at 9 or so. They've got a 
bar, a pool table, a few video 
games, and a bowling game, so 
you can blow most of an evening 
without ever setting foot on the 
dance floor. The Upstage is also 
hosting a bunch of shows with 
local and national bands  The 
Pleasure Heads, ATS, and Thin 
White Line filled the place up last 
Saturday, Inside The Big Car
sickness and a bunch of other 
bands will be there on Thursday, 
and both Alien Sex Fiend and 
Bullet LaVolta will be coming 
some time in the future (not to
gether). Stay tuned for details.
Jazz gets purity flak
By JEFF MULLER
Tartan Staffwriter
Wynton 
Marsalis, a 
jazz trum
peter who is 
indisputably 
one of the best 
in the world, 
is one of the 
leaders of a
movement which sees the world of jazz as being more limited 
than it actually is. Ill call these people jazz purists, because 
thats what they like to call themselves.
Jazz purists insist that there exists some sort of pure jazz, 
some form that is untainted by all of the horrible influences that 
have bred mongrel forms of music such as fusion and electric jazz-. 
Somehow, they believe that jazz really should have stopped pro^- 
gressing somewhere in the early 1960s.
Now I like bebop, swing, cool, and Dixieland, but I also enjoy 
listening to jazz-rock fusion, jazz-funk fusion, avant-garde, and 
electric jazz. These forms may be louder, harsher or just different 
from their predecessors, but they share elements of the jazz 
idiom.
These elements  the deciding factors as to whether a style is

A film for the ages, out on video
Next week, the greatest Eyetalian drive-in movie in history, 
made by the greatest Eyetalian 
director in history, based on the 
greatest Eyetalian story in his
tory  one of those that doesnt 
make a lick of sense, like all 
Eyetalian storiesis coining out 
on video.
On Video!
Did you hear me?
Its not only coming out on video. 
Its coming out on video in four 
different boxes.
You can get the original, uncut 
97-minute version.
If Tipper Gore is your Mama, 
you can get the R-rated 92-minute version, with all the Intestine 
Fu taken out.
If youre deaf, you can get a 
closed-caption version.
But if you remember this movie 
from when it first came out in 
1976, then youll wanna get the 
one I watched: complete, uncut, 
in original Cinemascope, where 
they get the whole screen as it 
originally looked at the drive-in, 
and then run black bars at the top 
and bottom. This ones a limited 
collectors edition for anybody who 
wants to pony up $89.98.
You know what Im talking 
about by now, dont you?
Its here.
Its Suspiria.
Its been 13 years, but its still 
like taking a bad-acid trip through 
Alice in Wonderland, only instead 
of Alice weve got Jessica Harper 
drugged with wine that has the 
consistency of blood, and instead 
of Wonderland weve got the 
German dance academy run by 
some groady-looking old ladies 
who go somewhere every night at 
9:30 and leave the innocent little 
girls in their dorms rooms to try 
to figure out why giant maggots 
are dropping out of the ceiling 
and messing up their hair-dos.
This movie is so weird its im
possible to describe, which is why 
true horror fans rank it with Night 
of the Living Dead and The Texas 
Chainsaw Massacre as one of the 
scariest flicks in splatter history. 
It satisfies the first rule of a drivein classic: anybody can die at any 
moment. And the second rule: the 
innocent must suffer. And the 
third: the zombies must rise. And 
it adds a fourth: the music on the 
soundtrack has to be so nervewracking that, even when
nothings happen0 ing, its scary.
 Dario Argento 
J has made a whole
1 slew of great
 slasherflicksThe
 Gallery Murders, 
Four Flies on Gray
Velvet, Inferno, Tenebrae  and 
he just finished a new one called 
Edgar Allan Poe, but Suspiria is 
the Gone With the Wind of Eyet
alian horror. (You have to see the 
ending to understand.)
Jessica Harper sets off for 
Freiburg, Germany, in a white 
dress, carrying a suitcase, but 
when she gets there, the airport 
is vacant, its raining so hard you 
cant see two feet, no taxis will 
stop for her, the streets are flood
ing, and when she finally makes 
here way to the school, a girl runs 
out screaming, the door is bolted, 
and Jessica is told to go away. At 
this point, Jessica decides to take 
a hotel room and try again the 
next day. Uh-oh, wrong choice.
Meanwhile, the screaming 
bimbo is getting attacked by two 
giant eyes in the sky. Her head 
gets rammed through a glass 
window, then shes stabbed four 
or five times in the stomach, then 
her heart is carved out of her 
chest  no, its not over yet  
then shes dropped through a giant
*5 .r1P5 ge5 ,eep ,rpo C no8h *.s8ouurno U,rfpz W45 Suspiria 1e5 C q eg 5Po ne.r5 do5o8T
skylight and her neck is snapped 
with a 50-foot-long-rope. Some 
lady tries to help her and  
whoops!giant glass pane to the 
head, steel support beam through 
the chest.
Now, like I say, it was two giant 
eyes. Thats it. Its an Eyetalian 
deal. Then later on, theres a blind 
guy with a seeing-eye dog whos 
attacked by a completely invisible 
presence. You know, ever once in 
while you see some American guy 
try to do this, and its boring. 
They do it overin Italy, with these 
hard-rock rub-a-dead-chipmunkover-an-electric-guitar musical
scores, and it scares the bejabbers out of you.
Thats all Im gonna say. Like I 
say, its a drug trip.
We have two breasts (and many 
twinkle-toed young girls cavort
ing in body stockings). A 97 on the 
Vomit Meter. Eight dead bodies. 
Millions of danglingmaggots. One 
bat attack. Head scissoring. 
Throat slitting. Throat ripping. 
Flesh eating. Death in a vat of 
barbed wire. Multiple stabbing. 
Hanging. The most disgusting 
snoring ever put on a soundtrack. 
Gratuitous ballet dancing. Gra
tuitous German beer-hall elbowslapping weenie dancing. Wind 
Fu. Rain Fu. Witch Fu. Drive-In 
Academy Award nominations fot 
Jessica Harper, as the dreamy, 
eyed drugged-up American girl 
whos being fattened up for the 
kill; Dario Argento, the master; 
and Joan Bennett, as the dance 
instructor who decided to go into 
witchcraft for the money.
One for the ages  Suspiria. ,
Four stars.
Joe Bob says check it out.
Joe Bob Briggs is the one and 
only drive-in-movie critic of Grape
vine, Texas.
Jazz purists are missing 
the musical point
feg5rg4oi U8e. sC1o kRq
jazz or not  are improvisations 
at the heart of the music and the 
use of jazz harmonies. What I 
mean by jazz harmonies is that 
extended chord forms make up 
the harmonic structure of the 
song. (Ornette Coleman must 
stand as an exception to this rule, 
as his avant-garde style of jazz 
relies upon extended melodic im
provisation, a technique which he 
refers to as harmelodics.)
Although he utilized rock tech
niques on the guitar, John 
McLaughlin was very much play
ing jazz when he electrified audi
ences with the Mahavishnu Or
chestra. The songs that he wrote 
employed altered harmonies and 
depended upon virtuosic improvi
sation. McLaughlins solos, like 
those of bebop saxophone legend 
Charlie Parker, consisted of arpeggiated extended chords and 
chordal substitutions.
Now lets look at the notion of 
purity in jazz. Jazz came into 
being as the amalgamation of
many different forms of music. 
Some musicologists claim ragtime 
as its origin, though European 
marching bands have as much a 
claim to the role of parent. For 
that matter, so do the blues and 
work songs and spirituals, for they 
all combined together to create 
the vital music known as jazz.
Because jazz was bom out of a 
combination of musical styles, it 
makes sense that a great deal of 
its evolution would come from 
combination with other styles. 
Jazz is a dynamic form of music, 
constantly changing and pushing 
ahead.
Older forms will continue, but 
newer forms must come into being 
for jazz to retain the energy that 
is its heart. World, classical, and 
rock influences are just a few of 
the directions in which jazz musi
cians will look in the future.
Marsalis seems to be slowly 
opening his eyes to the possibility 
of evolution in jazz. Maybe soon 
hell catch up with the rest of the 
jazz community.
AB Coffeehouse presents 
three-comic show Friday

Tartan Asst. Diversions Editor
So far this year all AB has pre
sented us with is movies and 
concerts, but no comedy. Well, 
Friday night AB Coffeehouse will 
be presenting three comedians.
Headlining the show is Rob 
Schneider. Schneider is best de
scribed as a one-man lunatic 
fringe. He dresses like a 50s 
rocker, bears a slight resemblance 
to the young Elvis Presley, and 
makes jokes on everyday topics 
such as cannibalism. Remember 
that soccer team from Chile that 
crashed in the Andes? he asks. 
To survive they had to eat ... 
airline food!
Schneiders appearances 
include Late Night With David 
Letterman, 227, An Evening At 
The Improv, MTV, and numerous 
colleges and club appearances.
The feature act is Shang Forbes, 
also known as The Powercat of
Comedy. Forbes act consists 
of high-energy one-liners and a 
lot of physical activity. He 
admits that only half of his act 
is planned, while in the other 
half he just lets whatever 
happens happen. Sometimes 
he gets so desperate that he 
begins to relate events from his 
own past, such as smoking drugs 
with Nancy Reagan or hanging 
out with the Pope.
Fridays show represents a 
departure from the usual cof
feehouse comedy shows. Instead 
of just one comic in concert, AB 
is presenting this show the way 
it would be seen in a comedy 
club. Its professional right down 
to the emcee, Mike Pirmez. Hes 
a local comedian from Greensburg, and he recently took first 
place in a laugh-off contest at 
Timothys in Delmont.
The laughter begins this Fri
day night in the Skibo Ballroom 
at 8 pm. Admission is free.
Real contributions to solving real world problems.
If you're good enough, you can make a difference.

THANKS FOR A JOB 
WELL DONE.
At The Travelers, we always have high hopes when it 
comes to the interns we recruit for our PACE training program. 
And, we're never disappointed.
Through our summer program, interns gain solid experi
ence in one of the most advanced Data Processing Depart
ments in corporate America. And, we come out ahead too.
Take this year's interns. They made real contributions to 
The Travelers' business. Whether assisting in the application of 
new technologies, providing IMS support, or testing COBOL 
application programs.
That's why The Travelers wants to take this opportunity 
to thank all of the students who participated in this year's
