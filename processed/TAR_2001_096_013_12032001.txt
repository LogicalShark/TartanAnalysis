Combined Pitt and CMU 
BioVenture project calls 
for $600 million budget
by Sinduja Srinivasan
Staff writer
Shoot for the stars seems to 
be the motto for Carnegie Mellon 
University and the University of 
Pittsburgh, which recently 
unveiled plans to join the com
puting and information technol
ogy skills of CMU with Pitts 
medical expertise in a $600 mil
lion project named Pittsburgh 
BioVenture.
According to details released 
by project officials last week, the 
BioVenture initiatives will focus 
on four core research areas. The 
targeted fields include drug dis
covery tools, medical devices 
and diagnostics, tissue/organ 
engineering and regenerative 
medicine, and therapeutic 
strategies for neurological^ and 
psychiatric disorders.
By concentrating on these spe
cific areas, BioVenture could 
potentially make Pittsburgh and 
the surrounding region, leaders 
in the field of biotechnology.
In order to accomplish its 
goals, the* project will need 
money, and a lot of it. It is esti
mated that over ten years 
BioVentures total cost will 
amount to $600 million, and will 
be funded by both public and pri
vate monies.
Former KDKA-TV business 
reporter and current Pittsburgh 
Regional Alliance public relations officer Bill Flanagan has 
been named chief communica
tions officer for the BioVenture 
project.
The sources of the $600 mil
lion are undetermined at this 
time, said Flanagan. The initia
tive has petitioned the 
Commonwealth for $40 million 
of $100 million in tobacco settle
ment money that has been set 
aside for three Life Sciences 
Greenhouse projects across 
Pennsylvania.
The initial goal is to come up 
with the local match for the $40 
million. Presumably this will be a 
combination of foundation, cor
porate support, and participa
tion by the Universities  per
haps in in-kind form, in the form 
of laboratory space, etc. Similar 
sources will have to be deter
mined for the balance of the 
funding as the project moves for
ward.
With only $80 million of the 
proposed $600 million funding 
tentatively accounted for, 
BioVenture may be several years 
in the making.
However, if full funding is 
eventually achieved, the 
BioVenture prospectus has pre
dicted an enormous economic 
impact for the Pittsburgh area.
Economic predictions include 
at least 5,000 new jobs in the 
bioscience industry, additional 
induced employment of at least

University professors 
debate information laws
John Davin/Production Manager
During Fridays Great Debate, Professors Touretzky and Shamos 
faced off about copyright laws and First Amendment rights.
by John Davin
Production Manager
Students and faculty walked 
on the wild side last Friday 
afternoon as they gathered for 
a University-sponsored event 
that featured illicit materials. 
It is Illegal to Display This 
Slide read a slide presented by 
David Touretzky, a principal 
scientist in computer science, 
during a debate titled Are 
Computer Programs Protected 
Speech? held in McConomy 
Auditorium. The debate took 
place between Touretzky and 
Michael Shamos, a professor of 
computer science, with Peter 
Shane, a professor of law and 
public policy, as the moderator.
The illegal slide presented 
to attendees was a copy of the 
code to DeCSS, a computer pro
gram that can decode the 
encryption scheme used to pro
tect DVDs. Last year in a feder
al court case involving DeCSS, 
Shamos testified in support of 
restrictions on programs such 
as DeCSS while Touretzky testi
fied on the opposing side, argu
ing that computer programs 
represent speech and should be 
protected under the First 
Amendment.
Shamos began Fridays 
debate with an explanation of 
First Amendment law and
pointed out that there is an 
immediate conflict between 
copyright and speech. You 
cant speak the words of a copy
righted play in public, said 
Shamos, explaining that other 
types of speech, such as dan
gerous or defamatory speech, 
are also restricted. Shamos 
believes that the primary rea
son computer programs do not 
deserve full First Amendment 
protection is that programs 
don't just say things  they do 
things when fed to a computer. 
Touretzky then presented an 
overview of the Digital 
Millenium Copyright Act 
(DMCA), which is a bill passed 
by Congress in 1998 outlawing 
the manufacture or distribution 
of circumvention devices. A 
circumvention device is consid
ered to be any tool that bypass
es access control systems that 
are often used to prevent the 
illegal reproduction of copy
righted material. However, 
much of the concern over the 
DMCA has stemmed from the 
fact that circumvention devices 
can have legitimate purposes 
 for example, DeCSS can be 
used to view DVDs on the Linux 
operating system, for which 
there is no approved DVD 
decryption software.
Touretzky said that there are 
many paradoxes or catch-22

Well-rounded admissions policy adds 
new vibrancy to campus community
by Brad Grantz
Managing Editor
At first glance, Carnegie Mellon 
appears to be a satellite campus of 
the United Nations. But University 
administrators disagree and the fig
ures concur: Large populaces and 
particularly African Americans are 
still considerably underrepresented 
and the University hopes that new 
diversity initiatives coupled with a 
well-rounded admittance policy will 
lead to greater numbers of African 
American and underrepresented 
minorities in a community that one 
Carnegie Mellon official character
ized as hostile.
Despite the existence of prefer
ences for racial and ethnic minorities 
in the admissions process dating to 
the Nixon administration, African 
American, Hispanic, and female 
enrollment percentages have paled 
in comparison to Asian and interna
tional student enrollment during 
that same time span.
Since 1990, the University has 
dramatically reduced the overall 
undergraduate acceptance rate from 
71 percent to 31.2 percent. During 
that same time period, the accep
tance rate for blacks declined rough
ly 30 percent, but their acceptance 
rate is still substantially larger than
SACs take on 
varied roles 
on campus

Staffwriter
For some students, it is an opportu
nity to socialize and grab a piece of 
free pizza. For others, it is a serious 
meeting to discuss future goals and 
actions. Student Advisory Councils 
(SACs) take on a myriad of structures 
and functions at Carnegie Mellon, as 
demonstrated at last Wednesdays 
first and last campus-wide SAC meet
ing of the semester. As student repre
sentatives from numerous advisory 
groups convened to share experi
ences and suggestions, questions 
were raised about the current effec
tiveness and future potential of the 
SAC system on campus.
Student Advisory Council for 
Student Advisory Councils (SAC 
SAC) was launched several years ago 
to provide a forum for representa
tives from the various campus SACs 
to come together and share informa
tion and ideas. The primary purpose 
of individual SAC groups is to study 
how Carnegie Mellon University 
might better achieve its educational 
goals. SACs present an opportunity 
for students to reformulate and rede
fine the Universitys missions.
SACs have been around for many 
years  at least 20, said Dean of 
Student Affairs Michael Murphy.

the University mean. Ultimately, 
CMU has failed to realize any 
improvement in the black under
graduate representation on campus. 
In 1994, blacks once numbered 5.8 
percent of incoming first-year stu
dents, but the percentage has since 
dwindled to a paltry 1.15 percent of 
2001 first-years, and they now con
stitute about 3 percent of the under
graduate population.
During the 1990s, several groups 
did increase, including the still 
underrepresented Hispanic group 
and Asians; conversely, Asians are 
no longer considered to be under
represented. Asians experienced the

Kevin Forde, Trey Jones, Joe 
McAndrew, and Jason Jones showed 
up with basketball in hand on 
Saturday, November 3, to play in a 
student tournament. One of their 
friends had told them about an 
event sponsored by the Hong Kong 
Student Association (HKSA), and 
asked them if they wanted to join in. 
But tournament heads turned them 
away at the last minute. The four left 
the gym, wondering why they, the 
only non-Asian students who would 
have participated, were turned 
away.
They gave the excuse that we 
were too good, said Forde, a fifthyear senior in computer science, 
who wondered how HKSA tourna
ment heads were able to assess their 
skills after never having met them 
before.
The four were trying to join 
another team, BAM (Brotherhood of 
Asian American Men) that needed 
more players. HKSA had sent an 
invitation to other Student 
Associations  SAs  including 
Taiwanese Student Association 
(TSA), Korean Student Association 
(KSA), and the Asian Student 
Association (ASA) to participate in 
the tournament, part of a nowannual tradition: the Asian Sports 
Meet.
Maybe I should have been mad, 
but I didnt really care, said Trey 
Jones, a senior public policy and 
management and political science 
major. Stuff like that happens all 
the time. When we go into the gym 
its almost like there are two courts. 
One court for everyone [else] and 
one for Asian people. If for some rea
son you cant get in on the first court 
you cant get in on the second one.
Peter Thong, a junior business 
administration major and the co
president of HKSA and one of the 
committee members that headed 
the tournament tried to explain 
what happened. There was confu
sion as to if only Asians were 
allowed to play or not, he said. The 
rules for who could be on a team 
should have been that only mem
bers affiliated with an SA could play. 
However, BAM, which is not an SA,

12 killed in 
Jerusalem blast
JERUSALEM (AP)  Two suicide 
bombers detonated nail-studded 
explosives in a downtown Jerusalem 
pedestrian mall crowded with young 
weekend revelers Saturday The blasts 
killed the assailants and 10 
bystanders and wounded 150 people.
Minutes after the back-to-back sui
cide bombings, another bomb went 
off in a car parked nearby sending 
panicked, screaming pedestrians 
running in all directions.
Eyewitness Eli Shetreet said he saw 
bodies being hurled in the air. A lot 
of people were crying, falling, and 
there was the smell of burning hair, 
said Shetreet, 19.
The attacks  coming after a week 
in which seven Israelis were killed in 
other incidents  increased pressure 
on the Palestinian Authority to take 
decisive action against militants 
groups waging a terror campaign 
against Israel and caused Israeli 
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon to cut 
short a US visit, according to an aide.
Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon 
Peres said it was one of the worst 
(attacks) we have ever seen.
There was no immediate claim of 
responsibility, but the militant Hamas 
and Islamic Jihad groups have threat
ened to carry out attacks in Israel to 
avenge the killing of Hamas military 
leader in the West Bank in an Israeli 
missile attack last week.
In a statement, the Palestinian 
Authority condemned the terror 
attacks, expressing its deep anger... 
and pain and accusing those behind 
it of trying to derail a US peace initia
tive. The Palestinian Authority has 
said that in recent days it has arrested 
several militants.
Israel has charged that Yasser 
Arafats government bears responsi
bility for the attacks against it by 
doing little to rein in the radicals. 
Israeli Cabinet minister Dan Meridor 
said Israel was tired of words ... 
(Arafat) needs to take action immedi
ately now because this cannot contin

President pushes 
stimulus bill
WASHINGTON (AP)  President 
Bush appealed Saturday for 
Congress to pass his stimulus pack
age and help Americans hurting 
from an economic downtown that 
has grown worse since the terrorist 
attacks.
, Inliis weekly radio address, Bush 
sparred with congressional 
Democrats over whether his pro
posal would truly help the growing 
number of people put out of work 
because of the attacks and the 
onset of a recession.
He said it does, by extending job
less benefits by 13 weeks in the 
states most affected by terrorism as 
well as offering Medicaid coverage 
for uninsured workers and emer
gency grants for job training.
We must bring quick help to 
those who need it most, and we 
must restore our economys 
growth Bush said. Its the holiday 
season. Its a time to reach out to 
Americans who are hurting, to help 
them put food on the table and to 
keep a roof over their, heads.
Democrats responded by saying 
the presidents plan does not do 
enough, and they attacked the 
House-passed package that offers 
billions in tax breaks to corpora
tions.
Unemployed workers need that 
money ... and they will use that 
money immediately, spending it 
and in turn helping stimulate the 
economy, said Senator Harry Reid 
of Nevada in the Democrats radio 
address.
These are difficult and unusual 
times, but we must not run up the
national debt with risky, unfair tax 
measures that wont help the econ
omy recover.
Bush said he wants to lower taxes 
on employers so they can expand 
and hire. He noted that he also 
asked Congress to speed along the 
income tax reductions passed in 
the spring so that people can keep 
more of their own money to spend 
or pay theirdebts.
Teen suffers 
burns to body
DELAND, Fla. (AP)  A 16- 
year-old boy suffered burns to a 
third of his body after his friends 
doused his clothes with rubbing 
alcohol and set him on fire, police 
said.
Nathaniel Bates and two 
friends, ages 14 and 15, were 
play wrestling Thursday in the 
woods.
The teens decided the loser of 
the match had to light a small por
tion of his body on fire, while the 
others wouldvideotape every
thing, said police spokeswoman 
Barbara West.
The tape showed the boys 
smacking one another with fold
ing chairs. Because Bates lost, he 
let his friends pour rubbing alco
hol on his shirt and set it on fire.
Police said the teens told them 
they had done the stunt safely 
many times before.
The boys ran inside and told the 
14-year-olds grandmother to call 
911. Bates suffered secondand 
third-degree burns to 36 percent 
of his body, said EVAC ambulance 
spokesman Mark OKeefe. He was

expressed horror and anger at the 
suicide attacks and strongly urged 
Arafat to do more to fight terrorism. 
He called on Arafat to immediately 
arrest those responsible.
Now more than ever, Chairman 
Arafat and the Palestinian Authority 
must demonstrate through their 
actions, and not merely their words, 
their commitment to fight terror, 
Bush said.
US envoy Anthony Zinni said in a 
statement that he had spoken to 
Arafat and made absolutely clear 
that those responsible for planning 
and carrying out these attacks must 
be found and brought to justice. This 
is an urgent task and there can be no 
delay nor excuses for not acting deci
sively.
Battle continues 
for Kandahar
KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) Tribal 
warriors claimed to be making a 
major assault on Taliban forces 
defending Kandahars airport 
Saturday night as thousands more 
fighters from another anti-Taliban 
faction headed toward the city from 
the north.
South of Kandahar, US jets pound

port incessantly, refugees from the 
embattled militias last stronghold 
said. Some told of increasingly des
perate Taliban soldiers moving from 
house to house, trying to hide among 
civilians from the fury of American 
airstrikes.
In the capital, Kabul, the Northern 
Alliances foreign minister, Abdullah, 
told reporters he believes Osama bin 
Laden and his lieutenants in the alQaida network are hiding in one of 
three provinces around Kandahar  
Uruzgan, Zabul or Helmand.
There were conflicting accounts 
about US bombs hitting villages late 
Friday and Saturday in eastern 
Afghanistan.
Villagers said 150 to 250 civilians 
were killed. Provincial officials also 
said US planes struck the villages, 
although they put the death toll 
much lower. An American spokesper
son in Washington said US planes 
attacked a nearby military target but 
denied any bombs hit the villages.

University raises pay 
to counter wage gaps
(U-WIRE) RALEIGH, NC  North Carolina 
State University is setting the precedent. It is not 
uncommon for universities to annually study fac
ulty salaries, but NCSU is the first UNC system 
school to put aside specific dollars to nip salary 
inequities in the bud.
Study findings indicate that out of 1,581 facul
ty members at NCSU, on average, female faculty 
members earn about $1,000 less than white 
males in the same position. In addition, minority 
male faculty members earn about $2,000 less 
than white males, on average.
NCSU officials estimate that 237' out of 371 
women and 134 out of 161 minority men will be 
eligible for pay increases to compensate for gen
der and race salary gaps. The salary increases will 
be retroactive from July 1, 2001, and were enact
ed this fall semester.
The Universitys first step in correcting genderand race-related salary discrepancies is allotting 
$600,000, plus benefits, to increase the salary of 
371 faculty members. The money will come from 
the tuition increase.
NCSU has been performing gender equity stud
ies for about 20 years, according to Provost Stuart 
Cooper. He attributed NCSUs action to a more 
professional study and a combination of both the 
consultants and the Yniversitys methodology.
In the past, Cooper said the studies were more 
informal. And in effect, though discrepancies 
were noted, the University did not initially 
respond.

Man convicted of 
stabbing his wife
(TT) PITTSBURGH, PA  After a 
two-day, non-jury trial, Lamont 
Frederick Jefferson, 38, of St. Clair 
Village was convicted of first-degree 
murder for the fatal stabbing of his 
wife, Michelle Jefferson, 42.
Allegheny County common pleas 
judge John Zottola sentenced 
Jefferson to life in prison for the April
3, 1999 murder during which 
Jefferson stabbed Michelle over 45 
times.
Jefferson had previously served a 
prison sentence for the nonfatal stab
bing of a girlfriend. While in prison, 
Jefferson and Michelle began a letter 
correspondence, and Michelle visited 
Jefferson after his release from jail. 
The couple soon married, and had 
one child, in addition to the six chil
dren that Michelle had from a previ
ous marriage.
Jefferson reportedly flew into a 
jealous rage when he discovered four 
letters addressed to his wifes maiden 
name from four different state prison 
inmates in early April of 1999. 
Without reading the letters, Jefferson 
stabbed Michelle to death.
During the trial, Jeffersons mother 
and sister testified before the judge 
that he suffered from emotional prob
lems that had been ignored by 
authorities during the investigation.
Two of Michelles children and her 
mother also approached the judge to 
express their sorrow over her death.
Although Jefferson did not com
ment extensively, he did apologize for 
the murder.
I hurt both families, said 
Jefferson. Im really sorry I did it.
Murphy receives 
tax reduction
(TT) PITTSBURGH, PA  
Pittsburgh Mayor Tom Murphy has 
won an almost 50 percent reduction 
in the assessed value of his Perrysville 
Avenue home in Perry South.
Over a year after contesting the 
value of his home, he was informed 
last week that the value had dropped 
from $87,700 to $45,900. The reduc
tion in value will cause a 47.7 percent 
reduction in Murphys property taxes 
from the city, county and Pittsburgh 
Public Schools.
Murphy launched a public dispute 
over the value placed on his twostory, three-bedroom home after the 
initial value determination by Sabre 
Systems and Service, the contractor 
hired to revalue every property in the 
county.
Along with Murphy, over 20,400 
county property owners have success
fully petitioned for reductions in their 
property values by appealing Sabres 
assessments.
In October, the News and Observer reported 
that neither UNC-Chapel Hill nor Duke 
University had turned to outside consultants to 
keep track of salary inequities.
We dont have to be ashamed, said Cooper. 
We want to fix it.
The consultant, Lois Haignere of Albany, NY, 
was hired by NCSU to complete the study of fac
ulty salaries for fall 2000.
I was thrilled that someone did a study, said 
Angela Davis-Gardner, associate professor of 
English. Its a beginning.
The study also found inequities in higher-rank
ing faculty positions on campus. At NCSU, 
women hold a disproportionately large share of 
visiting professor positions, which pay less, and 
men hold more research positions, which pay 
more. Women are less likely to have been named 
distinguished professors, and minorities are less 
likely to have departmental administrative posi
tions than white men are.
News of the salary increases for the 371 facul
ty members boosted the spirits of many.
U. Dayton technology 
used in anthrax fight
(U-WIRE) DAYTON, Ohio  Technology 
developed by the University of Dayton Research 
Institute and used by a Dayton company has 
been commissioned by the US Armys Medical 
Materiel Agency, the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention and the US State Department to 
fight against anthrax and other bio-terrorist
threats.
Hundreds of ice-free refrigeration systems 
from Energy Storage Technologies Inc. have 
been ordered to support emergency prepared
ness in homeland defense and to transport the 
anthrax vaccine to troops in the field.
Orders have skyrocketed since the September 
11 terrorist attacks, said Lloyd Huff, chief exec
utive officer of Energy Storage Technologies Inc. 
in Centerville, Ohio. The storage of these vac
cines is very critical at this time. The system is 
perfect for transporting temperature-sensitive 
vaccines and life-saving medical supplies to any
where in the world because the portable units 
will maintain a constant temperature for 40 or 
more hours on internal batteries.
Vaccines are routinely maintained in remote 
spots around the globe with conventional, most
ly kerosene-powered refrigerators and insulated 
iceboxes. However, these systems rely on ice and 
have inadequate temperature control to main
tain vaccine storage conditions. In addition, their 
energy requirements prohibit portability.
Energy Storage Technologies Inc. has devel
oped a portable solar or battery-operated refrig
erator called the VaxiCool. It features a vacuuminsulated refrigerator, a vacuum-insulated vac
cine carrying case, and packets of phase change 
materials that provide the constant temperature.
The standard version of the VaxiCool unit, 
about the size of a standard cooler, costs about 
$3,700. The smaller VaxiPac carrying case sells 
for about $250. UDRI holds a technology licens
ing agreement with Energy Storage 
Technologies Inc., which projects sales of $10 
million through 2002.

The teeth are the forgot
ten remains of the worldfamous St. Louis Baby Tooth 
Survey, which took place from 
1958 to 1970.

nuclear fallout on humans, specifi
cally children. By its end, the pro
ject had collected almost 300,000 
baby teeth, mostly from the St.

Rosenthal found that the 
amount of Strontium 90 in the 
children's teeth was directly relat

in the year of their birth.
The project came to an abrupt 
halt in 1970, during the Nixon 
administration, when its funding 
grant was cut. The remaining 
teeth were shipped to the Tyson 
Center for long-term storage, 
where they remained for over 
three decades until they were 
unearthed in May.
The administrators found piles

Medical intoxication, 11/17/01, 
8:00 AM  A CMU desk attendant 
notified police of an unconscious 
female in Morewood Gardens. The 
officer found the female sitting in a 
chair with a strong odor of alcohol 
on her breath. The officer was 
forced to shake and pinch the vic
tim to make her respond to ques
tions. CMU EMS and city medics 
both responded and the female was 
transported to the hospital. A wit
ness told police that he had seen 
the victim enter Morewood at 4 am 
in the company of a male and 
another female. The victim was 
crying and being consoled by her 
companions. The witness reported 
seeing the victim again, still crying 
and being consoled, at 6:30 am in a 
Morewood lounge. Finally, at 8 am, 
the witness saw the victim, uncon
scious, being carried by a different 
male to an area near the Morewood 
desk attendant.
Criminal attempt, 11/22/01, 
1:10 AM  National City Security 
Services called CMU police to 
report an alarm received from the 
National City Bank ATM in Baker 
Hall. Two CMU officers responded 
to the call and performed a check of 
Baker Hall. No persons were found 
in or around the building, though 
officers did observe an unknown 
individual running from Baker Hall 
toward Flagstaff Hill. A check of 
Flagstaff Hill and the surrounding 
area also proved negative for any 
persons. The ATM in question had 
one of two locks on its top panel 
unsecured. The actor or actors used 
some type of pry bar to force open 
the lock.
Indecent exposure, 11/26/01, 
3:15 PM  Two CMU students 
reported a suspicious person on 
Flagstaff Hill. The students, both 
female, were lying in a pile of 
leaves and talking when the actor 
approached hem. The male said it 
looked like the two were having fun 
and then asked if they wished to 
see him masturbate. When the stu
dents informed him they did not 
wish to see him masturbate, the 
individual asked them why not, 
since it wasnt like they were going 
to have sex. The actors zipper was 
down and his penis was exposed. 
The students left the area at this 
time. The students did not report 
the incident for a couple of hours 
because they did not feel threat
ened.

Pitt lets vendors 
back on campus
On Friday the University of 
Pittsburgh announced a new set of 
guidelines for vendors on campus. 
Vendors must now pay the 
University $60 a day to sell goods 
and merchandise and up to $200 a 
day to sell services.
In October, Pitt received public 
criticism for removing all vendors 
from campus. University officials 
said that a lack of policies to regu
late the insurance, licenses, and 
product quality of vendors prompt
ed their decision.
The University said that after 
new regulatory policies were estab
lished, the vendors could return to 
campus.
Vendors will now be permitted 
on campus between the hours of 9 
am and 7 pm. Eight spaces outside 
of the William Pitt Union will be 
available for vendors. If more than 
eight vendors apply for space on a 
given day, the University will deter
mine which vendors are the most 
likely to appeal to students.

play.
Darren Chan, a junior architect 
major who helped organize the BAM 
team, said that he was told by tour
nament heads that there ought to be 
a more level playing field, which is 
why the four students were not 
allowed to play on his team. There 
was an Asian student that was actu
ally on the varsity basketball team. If 
that was the case, they shouldnt 
have allowed [him] to play, said 
Chan.
Two weeks later, HKSA held 
another event as part of the Meet, a 
volleyball tournament, where 
Thong said guidelines were a little 
clearer. Still, one non-Asian student, 
Trey Smith, a graduate robotics stu
dent was supposed to be part of a 
team but found out later that his 
team could not play.
I have to say at first I was really 
surprised. It doesnt seem like orga
nizations at CMU would do some
thing like that, said Smith.
Thong said he was unaware of this 
particular incident. The person who 
organized Smiths team, who wishes 
to remain anonymous, said he didnt 
feel it was a matter of discrimina
tion. He said he understood that it 
was invitation-only and non-members of SAs were not allowed to play.
What appears now to be a matter 
of misunderstanding or miscommunication between students still sug
gests a feeling that exists with some

her organization has faced for the 
past several years. But, she stresses 
that ASA is not an exclusive organi
zation and allows members of any 
background to join.
Organizations such as ASA and 
HKSA list their major mission on 
campus as providing a social outlet 
for students who are part of or are 
interested in a certain culture. A sec
ondary goal is to also promote the 
culture on campus.
The whole point [of ASA] is to 
have social events so that we can 
learn from each other, said Fong. 
ASA and other organizations fre
quently hold events such as last 
Friday nights ice skating event in 
Schenley Park, which drew in a num
ber of Asian and non-Asian students. 
Fong said that before coming to 
CMU, she had come from a predominantiy white town where she did not 
have very much opportunity to inter
act with other Asian students. ASA 
provided her with a way to do that.
I think in general this campus is 
pretty segregated, said Hsu. One 
factor that contributes to this, he 
said, could be that the University 
does not promote enough cultural 
events. He added that international 
students, in particular, sometimes 
tend to stick together. When you 
first come to campus from another 
country, you tend to hang out with 
people you feel most comfortable 
with, said Hsu.
Chan says that his organization,
BAM, provides more of a way to 
bond for its members than what 
they get from organizations like 
ASA. He adds that the purpose of 
BAM is also to positively represent 
Asians on campus through service 
events. BAMs long-term goal is to 
receive a bid to start a Carnegie 
Mellon chapter of Lambda Phi 
Epsilon, a national Asian interest 
fraternity. This is also the goal of 
Asian American Women (AAW), 
who wish to start a sorority in the 
same vein.
I tried to convince my suitemate, 
a Caucasian, to join [BAM]. But its 
hard to get non-Asians to join, said 
Chan.
Members of several organizations 
say they regret that students often 
feel that their organizations are 
exclusive in nature.
We dont limit our events to 
African Americans. But, it seems as 
if people think that Spirit is just lim
ited to African Americans, said 
Aisha Rutherford, a junior policy 
and management major and 
President of Spirit, an organization 
on campus that promotes black cul
ture.
I suggest doing events together
 I think this would break a barrier 
between the groups," said
Rutherford, who added that in the 
past, ASA and Spirit have had suc
cessful joint events. Other students 
agree that combined events tend to 
bring students from different back
grounds together. Examples include 
the International Food Festival, 
which several organizations partici
pate in.
Kavita Arora, a junior electrical 
and computer engineering major 
and President of the International 
Student Union (ISU) said the goal of 
her organization is to promote cul
tural awareness.
We try to get the whole campus 
involved ... Our goal is to spread 
awareness, she said. Arora says she 
never has felt discriminated against 
at CMU. According to my view, Ive 
always felt welcome into any 
group.
I dont necessarily see discrimina
tion, but I do see separation on cam
pus all of the time, said Jason Jones. 
A lot of time you feel comfortable 
with people that are like you or have 
a similar background and it is hard to 
step outside of your comfort zone.
As for the HKSA basketball tourna
ment, Thong said he realizes that 
things should have been handled dif
ferently. The basketball tournament 
was a mistake. For next year, well 
make the rules clearer.

Minority initiatives
To augment the number of minori
ties enrolled, CMU has introduced 
new measures aimed to make the 
University more inviting to African 
Americans and Hispanics. Three 
years ago, CMU discontinued the 
Carnegie Mellon Action Project 
(CMAP), the summer program 
designed to give incoming underrep
resented minorities a boost for the 
fall semester. The resources have 
been channeled into the Summer 
Academy of Minority Scholars 
(SAMS), a program designed for 
academically average high school 
students in grades 9 - 11.
The program is really targeted at 
C students and trying to make them 
A, B students by giving them a good 
healthy dose academically and turn 
them on to high power study, said 
director of admissions Mike Steidel.
While no college credit is awarded 
and admittance to Carnegie Mellon 
is not guaranteed, the program is
entirely bankrolled by the University. 
During the inaugural 2001 term, 50 
juniors and 50 sophomores partici
pated in the program. Steidel and 
others are looking forward to the 
results of program, measured in the 
number of applicants accepted into 
the undergraduate program who 
graduated from SAMS.
To obtain a higher yield of minori
ty applicants (those who are accept
ed and enroll at ,CMU), the 
University has set in place other net
work-building events. Sleeping Bag 
Weekends designed particularly for 
minorities and targeted telephoning 
of minority applicants are two meth
ods by which CMU struggles to 
increase the minority populations on 
campus. CMAP continues to play an 
integral part for minorities, offering 
school-year tutoring and counseling.
While high school-specific pro
grams may garner more applica
tions, Vice President for Enrollment 
Bill Elliott argues that a fundamental 
shift must occur in the Carnegie 
Mellon climate.
Theres a whole issue in regard to 
campus climate, said Elliott. The
city of Pittsburgh is part of the issue 
whether or not this is as inviting as a 
surrounding community.
Discussions with minority CMU 
students have provided him with 
several stark characterizations of 
Carnegie Mellon.
This is not a very wholesome 
place to be. Its not a very inviting 
place to be. And they [underrepre
sented minorities] say the citys not 
a very inviting place to be, said 
Elliott.
The straight-edge, hard-knock 
lifestyle of CMU may be unwelcom
ing for some minority applicants, 
but Carnegie Mellon is a more lively 
and conscientious campus than it 
was 10 years ago, let alone 25, and 
Steidel attributes it to a dramatic 
shift in acceptance decisions from 
academic criterion to non-academic 
considerations beyond an academic 
threshold.

News Editor
Despite its international reputa
tion as an academic and research 
institute that draws students from 
every state and over 100 different 
countries, Carnegie Mellon contin
ues to struggle with a lack of diver
sity among its campus community. 
With the number of African 
American and Hispanic students 
moving minimally between four 
and five percent for the past five 
years and the infamous male to 
female ratio remaining steady at 
three to two, Carnegie Mellon 
faces a serious challenge to 
increase diversity at a Universitywide level. The Diversity Advisory 
Council (DAC), a 35-member 
group of administrators, faculty, 
staff, and students, undertook this 
challenge nearly three years ago in 
an attempt to identify and develop 
strategies to bring a more varied 
population to campus.
According to an April ______
2000 report by the DAC,
Carnegie Mellons dis
proportionately low 
number of females and 
racial minorities sets the 
University behind other 
public and private fouryear institutions. Peer 
schools that rank in the 
first quartile for minority 
representation have at 
least 25 percent more 
minority undergraduate 
students, 55 percent
more minority graduate ------
students, and 35 percent more 
minority faculty.
We get a lot of international stu
dents, said Indira Nair, vice 
provost for education. But, in 
terms of domestic diversity, we are 
not very good.
According to Cristina Amon, a 
mechanical engineering professor 
and the co-chair of the faculty 
issues work group of the DAC, the 
group spent its first year assessing 
the problems of diversity on cam
pus and gathering and analyzing 
data about the demographical 
composition of the campus com
munity. During its second year, 
the DAC members formed groups 
to address specific diversity issues 
and to draft recommendations for 
enacting change.
Now entering its third year, the 
DAC groups are working to see 
their recommendations realized 
throughout the University.
Professor of architecture Omer 
Akin, who served on the faculty 
issues DAC work group last year, 
said that the members focused 
on identifying positive diversity 
actions rather than pinpointing 
glaring deficiencies while draft
ing diversity recommendations.
Akin said that although faculty 
members might be experts in par
ticular areas, they do not auto
matically recognize or understand 
issues of diversity.
Faculty members can be objec
tive about individual fields, but 
were not particularly wellendowed in the area of cultural 
and social equity, said Akin.
Akin and Amon both stressed 
the importance of allowing facul
ty members to approach diversity 
issues with their own unique solu
tions based upon the variables of 
individual departments.
Local efforts are very impor
tant, said Akin. Diversity needs 
to be spearheaded by depart
ments.
Amon explained that although 
college departments have usually 
had their diversity data and initia
tives evaluated by an external 
advisory board every three or four 
years, there was concern that 
this wasnt [a frequent enough] 
evaluation. After a November 
retreat for department heads, 
deans, and DAC members led by 
DAC chairperson President Jared 
Cohon, an internal accountability 
chain was created to monitor 
diversity within departments. 
Now, each department head 
reports diversity progress to their 
dean, who in turn reports to Mark 
Kamlet, Provost, and President

Mellon for graduate school infor
mation sessions. The goal of the 
program is to interest more 
African American architecture stu
dents in graduate school, and ulti
mately, in teaching at a university 
level.
It is a 20 to 25 year strategy, 
said Akin. But, I think it will pay 
off for us and for others. He 
added that many diversity initia
tives of the DAC are long-term 
strategies.
Approval of DAC recommenda
tions has been slow within the fac
ulty senate, where formal facultyspecific DAC recommendations 
were presented last May. 
According to Clark Glymour, a phi
losophy professor and faculty sen
ate chair, the senate will soon 
announce its final approval and 
implementation plan for one of 
the DACs May recommendations.
Glymour refused to disclose the 
exact initiative that has been 
approved, but said that faculty 
senate has been negotiating with
_______ Kamlet about the
details of the plan for 
several months.
Glymour also said that 
the plan was one of two 
DAC recommendations 
that will require direct 
University funding.

nity members may

Faculty DAC members have also 
focused on the creation of pro
grams for the mentoring of minor
ity and women faculty members, 
the increase of the number of 
available child care slots, and the 
modification of the family leave 
policy.
For student representatives, the 
DAC includes three undergradu
ates and two graduate students.
As a student, I am asked specif
ically for comments during the 
meetings, said Crystal Hall, a 
junior policy and management 
and decision sciences double 
major and a member of the DAC. 
The group seems to genuinely 
value the input of student per
spective into their ideas.
Despite the relatively low num
ber of student representatives on 
the DAC, Hall believes that the 
group is inclusive of student, fac
ulty, and staff members from 
across the Carnegie Mellon acade
mic spectrum.
Lenore Blum, a computer sci
ence professor and a member of 
DAC described the demographic 
make-up of DAC as acceptable, but 
conceded that the group could 
have more student involvement.
Many of the current proposals of 
the DAC focus on faculty-related 
initiatives, although some depart
ments have created their own student-focused diversity plans. Akin 
described a program begun in the 
school of architecture that invites 
African American students from 
other colleges to come to Carnegie
----------- bers stressed the diffi
culty of enacting fast change in the 
area of diversity.
Everybody wants diversity, but 
you have to get off your chair and 
do something about it, said Akin.
When we need to enact change 
in a strong way, we need incen
tives, said Amon, adding that 
DAC administrative leaders favor 
the use of incentives to spur diver
sity initiatives in various depart
ments and programs on campus.
As in most areas, money talks 
and success produces success, 
said Blum. Thus, it might be good 
to have a [monetary] award each 
year for the college or unit that has 
made tl\e most strides or 
embarked on the most innovative 
endeavors with regard to diversi
ty. The efforts of the DAC, though 
seemingly invisible at the present, 
may become more notable on 
campus as diversity initiatives are 
gradually implemented.
Despite the lengthy process of 
formulating, presenting, and gain
ing approval of diversity initia
tives, combined with the knowl
edge that, as with mostly long
term goals, they may never fully 
see the impact of their ideas and 
actions on campus, the DAC mem
bers remain optimistic that they 
have the opportunity to affect pos
itive diversity change at Carnegie 
Mellon.
I think that the DAC has made 
progress and that more will come 
in the future, said Amon. We 
have to start harvesting what we 
have been seeding. We will start to 
see improvement.
ence rather than just an academic 
experience, said Steidel.
Four years ago, the movement 
toward non-academic considera
tions became more cognizant of 
character trait indicators like leader
ship experience, extracurricular 
activities, and the overall impres
sion; the criteria is now the overar
ching diversity component.
While several schools battle more 
controversial admittance practices 
in court, CMUs admissions prac
tices avoid the clash over quotas 
and race-enhanced admittance for
mulas by using mechanistic systems 
that automatically provide minori
ties with supplementary points 
before considering the individuals 
academic history or other factors.
CMU has taken a common path
 a formula that rewards appli
cants for their diversity contribu
tion, a wide-reaching facet of 
admissions only employed for 
applicants who meet or exceed the 
Universitys academic threshold, 
a bottom line predictor between 
academic success and failure.
And while many colleges have 
been accused of lowering standards 
to achieve greater diversity, CMU 
has appeared to found common 
ground between more rigorous aca
demic principles and greater selec
tivity amongst applicants.
2001s incoming undergraduate
class posted a 1340 mean SAT score, 
comparable with past classes and far 
higher than the 1990 figure of 1200.
Increased attention from 
President Cohon two years ago on 
minority acceptance rates has 
attempted to curb a tide of dissipat
ing black acceptance rate. The 
University-wide figure bottomed out 
at 37.6 percent in 1999. One year 
earlier, the African American accep
tance rate (41.7 percent) fell below 
the University-wide rate (42.4 per
cent) for the first time since 1989. 
The African American acceptance 
rate has since rebounded to 45.8 
percent.
The nonacademic factor crusade 
had its roots in the School of 
Computer Science. In 1997, the Dean 
had challenged SCS to strive to cre
ate world leaders. To achieve such a 
goal, Steidel and others began to 
look at non-academic factors. An 
interesting trend developed that has 
generated publicity for what was 
once an all-boys club.
Once we started using nonacade
mic factors in terms of admissions 
decisions, that ended up being sig
nificant in terms of beginning to shift 
who it was that we were taking, 
because [women] were really strong 
in that area, said Steidel.
Economic diversity
For colleges, diversity is not
always about the color of ones skin, 
but also a persons background. And 
possibly the most difficult brand of 
diversity to obtain at a $30,000 a 
year institution is fiscal diversity, or 
socioeconomic background.
Yeah, I think the percentage of 
students on financial aid has always 
been high at Carnegie Mellon, so 
the diversity of students and socioe
conomic backgrounds is broad at 
Carnegie Mellon, said Elliott.
His sentiments are not exactly 
given a ringing endorsement by his 
peers, however.
In an interview several weeks 
ago, vice provost for Education 
Indira Nair said that CMU must do a 
better job achiving domestic and 
socioeconomic diversity.
While Carnegie Mellon may 
award a larger financial aid pack
age than competing schools, they 
are one step behind some peer insti
tutions who have reevaluated the 
elements of fiscal assistance, espe
cially for students with less than 
lavish upbringings.
Theres a price tag to it, said 
Steidel. Peer institutions are ... 
replacing the loan job component, 
the self-help component of finan
cial aid, with increased grant dol
lars. Such inviting monetary aid 
means less time working off student 
loans and ideally, more time work
ing on studies.

Professor wins psychology award
by Sara Stille
Co-Editor-in-Chief
Last week, James McClelland, co
director of the Center for Neural 
Basis of Cognition, followed in the 
footsteps of such renowned psychol
ogists as Allen Newell and Herbert 
Simon and carried on the Carnegie 
Mellon tradition of award-winning 
research in cognitive psychology. 
McClelland, along with his long
time collaborator David Rumelhart, 
a psychology professor at Stanford 
University, was presented with the 
University of Louisville Grawemayer 
Award.
I hope the award will reinforce 
the perception that Carnegie Mellon 
is the leading institution anywhere 
for the study of the mechanisms that 
underlie human cognitive abilities 
and their development, said 
McClelland.
McClelland and Rumelhart have 
worked together, and with a group 
of neurobiologists, computer scien
tists, physicists, and mathemati
cians, for two decades on a cognitive 
framework called parallel distrib
uted processing. The research group 
explored the idea of connectionism, 
meaning that no single neuron in the 
human brain does its job alone in 
processing information and that 
neural networks decide things col
lectively and simultaneously rather 
than just in sequence. Their study 
has affected research in multiple
sub-fields of psychology including 
decision-making, language develop
ment, economics, engineering, and 
artificial intelligence.
The only thing I regret is that the 
prize went only to David and me, 
and not to the whole group that 
introduced the idea of parallel dis
tributed processing, said 
McClelland, who is currently on sab
batical in London.
This year, the Grawemeyer 
Foundation at the University of 
Louisville received 35 nominations 
for the year 2002s psychology 
award. McClelland was nominated 
for the award and received a letter 
asking for a brief statement and 
copies of his most important works.
The Grawemeyer Foundation 
annually awards $1 million  
$200,000 each for works in music 
composition, education, ideas 
improving world order, religion, and 
psychology. The award is given in 
honor of Charles Grawemeyer, who 
was an industrialist, entrepreneur, 
and University of Louisville gradu
ate.
I am thinking hard about what to 
do with the money, said 
McClelland. One thing I am pon
dering is the fact that research fund
ing tends to support continuations of 
existing, successful work rather than 
innovations. I wish there was a way 
to fund novel, risky, innovative work. 
I want to start thinking about 
whether theres anything I can do 
with the money to encourage such
Professor James McClelland
efforts.
McClelland said that he is current
ly working on a project focusing on 
the correlation between experience 
and the development of sophisticat
ed cognitive abilities through the 
first 10 to 15 years of life.
McClelland has been a faculty 
member at Carnegie Mellon since
1984. He has joint appointments in 
psychology and computer science 
and was elected to be a University 
Professor this year. He is also an 
adjunct professor at the University of 
Pittsburgh.
He received his bachelors degree 
in psychology from Columbia 
University in 1970 and a doctorate in 
cognitive psychology from 
University of Pennsylvania in 1975. 
McClelland was a psychology faculty 
member at University of CaliforniaSan Diego from 1975 until coming 
to Carnegie Mellon.

CMU goes against trend 
of decreasing grad rates
Student Advisory Councils vary in function, structure
SACs, from page A1
The basic idea, as with any organiza
tion, is simply to ensure good, open 
communications.
Activities of individual SACs 
include discussions and actions on 
issues such as first-year student sup
port, concerns about specific course 
content, faculty-student relations, 
and space considerations. SACs might 
invite a representative from the 
Career Center or Academic 
Development Center to come share 
advice in those areas to their group. 
They might also host a faculty-stu
dent gathering, such as a picnic or 
book review.
SAC SAC representatives are nor
mally supposed to meet several times 
each semester to update each other 
about activities planned for their indi
vidual SACs, with the intent being to 
further the distribution of informa
tion to students. Despite the wellintentioned goals of both the SAC 
SAC and SACs at Carnegie Mellon, 
several SAC members expressed con
cerns about the system of student rep
resentative groups after last 
Wednesdays meeting.
Where most SACs are headed
Basically it is extremely difficult to 
get students to care in this school, 
said Kyle Fleit, a junior affiliated with 
the business administration SAC. 
With so many things competing for 
interest, it is just like going to another 
meeting. Either students dont know 
about it, or it hasnt generated 
enough interest.
Not all colleges at Carnegie Mellon 
have SACs or even informal represen
tative student groups. While some 
SACs, like that of Information 
Systems, serve almost as social orga
nizations, others like that of Electrical 
and Computer Engineering (ECE) are 
barely in the start-up phase, having 
had only one meeting during the 
whole fall semester.
Student representation at Carnegie 
Mellon University happens through 
both formal and informal channels. 
Formal student representation is 
composed of the recognized student 
government organizations, which 
include Graduate Student Assembly, 
Student Senate, Student Dormitory 
Council, and various college commit
tees like SACs. These organizations of 
formal student representation are 
elective or appointive, and it is gener
ally agreed that their mission is to 
represent the voice of students to 
CMLPs administration and faculty.
However, as far as the SACs are 
concerned, not all representatives are 
elected or appointed, and admission 
is almost always universal. Some stu
dents believe that these inconsisten
cies result because the administration 
and the faculty do not pay enough 
attention to student representative 
bodies or their leaders, while others 
believe that the weaknesses lie within 
the student organizations them
selves. Still others have observed that 
informal student leaders not connect
ed with any representative body play 
a larger role on campus simply by 
virtue of more frequent contact with 
the appropriate deans or faculty 
members.
Whatever the state of current stu
dent representation, it is clear that 
student government and student rep
resentative committees have the abil
ity to play an important educational 
role.
I believe theres tremendous 
potential for SACs (and departments, 
for that matter) to learn a ton from 
each other, said Andrew Bayowski, a
material sciences and engineering 
major (MSE) and the president of the 
MSE SAC. But first it takes admitting 
that you just might not be perfect, tak
ing an open-minded approach to col
laboration, and having a willingness 
to learn from others. After all, thats 
why were all here....
Fields For Improvement
Some students, concerned by both 
the recent SAC SAC meeting the chal
lenges facing several individual SACs 
offered suggestions for the improve
ment of the SAC system at Carnegie 
Mellon.
I think students need to first estab
lish a SAC if their department doesnt 
have one, said Bayowski. Once 
youve got one, its as easy as showing 
up for the free pizza, raising your 
hand, and voicing your opinions, con
cerns, and ideas.
After SAC groups are formed, it is 
key that they all have a common 
understanding of their function and 
goals as representative student 
groups, said a SAC representative 
who wished to remain anonymous.
SAC reps need to understand 
Carnegie Mellons mission toward 
building an educational triad  in 
academics, research and community. 
SACs should urge a new system of 
governance for CMU that includes 
opportunities for student participa
tion as a means of learning-by-doing, 
and the framework for better interac
tion among students from different 
departments, research, political, liv
ing, and interest groups. I feel we are 
lacking that.
Mary Ann Feusner, a senior repre
sentative of the Bachelor of 
Humanities and Art Program and the 
Bachelor of the Sciences and Art 
Program (BHA/BSA) SAC expressed
concern that there is little interaction 
between different SACs and their rep
resentatives.
Perhaps SAC SAC should meet 
more often to keep those representa
tives energized, said Dean Murphy.
Rowshan Palmer, coordinator of 
student development and housefellow for Donner Hall, said that the 
website for the SAC SAC had not been 
updated or running as of the meeting 
date this semester.
Potential For Change
Several SAC representatives pre
sent at the SAC SAC meeting dis
played confidence for improvement 
in the system and noted that they 
have been inspired by the work of 
some of the more organized SACs like 
that of the chemical engineering and 
biology departments and the 
University Student Affairs Council 
(USAC) which has implemented a 
mentoring program to increase inter
action between upper-class students 
and first-years and worked to 
increase campus awareness of crime.
All organizations experience an 
ebb and flow of energy and enthusi
asm. I would suggest that any faculty 
member or student interested in 
starting or rejuvenating a SAC speak 
with their department head or with 
me direcdy, said Dean Murphy.
The reports of positive and proac
tive initiatives by some SACs on cam
pus encouraged Palmer, who said 
that there is immense scope for 
improvement within the SAC sys
tem.
The critical issue is that all col
leges, schools, and departments 
have SAC representatives, said 
Dean Murphy. SACs are not the only 
way to achieve that, but I think they 
hold great potential.

\Undergraduate students are 
taking longer than four years to 
graduate these days, reports say, 
resulting in overcrowding at 
many universities nationwide. 
However, Carnegie Mellon may 
be an example of the exact oppo
site of this trend.
According to a recent 
University of Michigan report, 
private academic institutions 
with a yearly tuition of $23,000 
or more have the highest fouryear graduation rates. In addi
tion, a 1996 graduation rate 
study administered by the 
Integrated Post-secondary 
Education Data System (IPEDS), 
showed that students at inde
pendent/private Pennsylvania 
universities (including Carnegie 
Mellon) had a 58 percent fouryear graduation rate, as com
pared to a 30 percent rate at 
state-affiliated schools.
Why do students at private 
institutions, such as Carnegie 
Mellon, tend to graduate on 
time more often than public 
university students?
William Elliot, vice president 
for Enrollment at Carnegie 
Mellon, said that the Universitys 
position as a school with high 
graduation rates can be attrib
uted to the general responsible 
attitude of the student applying 
to or attending Carnegie Mellon. 
They are stronger students with 
obviously different missions 
[than those at other universi
ties], said Elliot. Our purpose 
is not to take as many students as 
we can. We look for a very spe
cific number of students in every 
college.
Elliot noted that many of the 
problems he has seen with 
decreasing graduation rates 
have been at California universi
ties and colleges, where such 
institutions must accommodate 
larger groups of students.
According to some Carnegie 
Mellon students, one reason for 
the on-par graduation rate may 
be that many University students 
are more career-driven com
pared to other college students.
As a CMU student, Im more 
likely to go to work than to grad
uate school because I see other 
people who graduated [from 
CMU] out there working, said 
Amber Jackson, a senior techni
cal writing major who is gradu
ating after four years. She added 
that, at public institutions such 
as the University of Pittsburgh, 
students seem to want to pursue 
a graduate degree and stay in 
school longer before they pursue 
a career.
Philip Svigals, a sophomore 
BSA student in biology and art, 
notes a different reason for plan
ning to graduate in four years. 
Theres no way Im going to take 
more than four years to gradu
ate; Ive got loans to pay.
The reasons for prolonging the 
undergraduate career are typi
cally collective issues. Students 
switch majors, requiring them to
spend more time graduating; 
even double majoring can cause 
a setback in graduating within 
four years. Students may also 
involve themselves in extracur
ricular activities that cut into 
academic schedules.
Penn State student Nick 
Avitabile plans on being at his 
university for four and a half 
years before graduating. A junior 
biology major with minors in 
French and business, Avitabile 
hopes to attend medical school 
upon graduation and is busy ful
filling medical school require
ments in his penultimate year. I 
could try to take [the extra 
courses] in the summer or try to 
jam them into my schedule in the 
future semesters, but I would be 
cramming calculus, biology, 
physics, and organic chemistry 
all into the same semester ... not 
a good idea.
I find that at Penn State, 
many people take an extra year 
or semester to graduate, said 
Avitabile. There are a lot of rea
sons. Some people switch 
majors. Also, sometimes people 
double major in completely dif
ferent things. And lastly, there is 
the reason that many Penn State 
students dont want to squeeze 
too many classes into one semes
ter, or that they drop credits due 
to failing and/or partying too 
much.
Despite the trend to graduate 
on time at Carnegie Mellon, 
fifth-year seniors on campus 
insist that they made the right 
choice by staying.
Omari Teel, a fifth-year senior 
and double major in computer 
science and biology, says, 
[Taking five years] has kept me 
from being insanely busy for the 
last year or so, and it has given 
me more time to think about 
what I want to do after I gradu
ate.
University officials nationwide 
are enacting plans to encourage 
students to graduate on time. 
Because economic factors and 
tuition costs can cause attrition 
rates to rise, the University of 
Michigan endorses a flat tuition 
rate that gives full-time students 
taking eighteen credits the same 
tuition rate as those taking the 
usual twelve credits.
Other universities offer a 
guaranteed degree program, in 
which a student is assured a 
degree within four years if she or 
he completes all courses deemed 
necessary for the major by her or 
his advisor. The major stipula
tion of this program is that stu
dents may not switch majors 
once they apply to a particular 
department.
Elliot does not believe there 
will be a problem with dropping 
four-year graduation rates at 
Carnegie Mellon in the future.
I dont anticipate decreasing 
the number of courses available 
so that students have less to 
choose from [and therefore have 
to take longer to graduate], nor 
do I anticipate us accepting more 
students [so that there are less 
course slots available to students 
at a given time].
Touretzky and Shamos debate Millenium 
Copyright Act and First Amendment laws
DEBATE, from page A1
statements in the DMCA. An 
exemption clause in the law states 
that libraries and educational insti
tutions may circumvent access con
trols to view a work in order to 
decide whether to purchase it. 
However, later in the same section, 
the law states that these institu
tions may not manufacture or oth
erwise acquire any product which 
circumvents a technological mea
sure.
Touretzky discussed his online 
DeCSS gallery that contains the 
DeCSS code recorded as a song, 
printed on a t-shirt, photographed, 
and represented in other forms. He 
argued that code should not be 
restricted by the law since it can 
express ideas just as standard 
speech can. The censorship of 
ideas is intolerable, said Touretzky 
in the conclusion to his argument.
However, Shamos believes that 
the temptation to illegally obtain 
copyrighted material is far too great 
to not restrict methods of obtaining 
such materials. He pointed out that 
if someone can obtain a movie for
free online, they are very unlikely to 
go out and buy the movie.
The movie industry has not col
lapsed  DVDs are doing just fine, 
said Touretzky in response. He sug
gested that it may be impossible to 
completely eliminate distribution of 
dangerous code. Citizens today 
have communication power that 
they never had before, said 
Touretzky, adding that within the 
foreseeable future, computers will 
be able to understand English 
instructions and that the govern
ment will have to outlaw speech 
based on its content.
The professors discussed the pos
sibility that the DMCA will inhibit 
academic research and possibly 
motivate organizers of international 
security conferences to relocate out
side of the US.
Earlier this year, Princeton profes
sor Edward Felten was threatened 
by the Recording Industry 
Association of America (RIAA) 
when he and fellow researchers 
cracked a security protocol that may 
be used to protect media files. In 
response, Felten sued the RIAA for 
interfering with his academic pur
suits.
I think it was a mistake for the 
industry to threaten Felten, said 
Shamos. Felten was not trafficking 
in a circumvention device.
A question and answer period 
with the audience brought up the 
idea that simply the possibility of 
legal threats cows many people into 
submission. Shamos and Touretzky 
both agreed that this is a problem 
with the law and with the legal sys
tem that should be remedied.
When questioned about how 
copyright infringement should be 
prevented, Touretzky stressed the 
need to prosecute violators. He said 
that the media industry should 
begin using automated programs 
that search the Internet for illegally 
distributed content and should then 
prosecute these people in accor
dance with copyright law.
An underlying theme of the 
debate, was that preventing copy
right infringement while still allow
ing for fair use of computer code is a 
complicated issue that should 
receive a great deal of public atten
tion and debate in the coming 
years.

Wheres the beef?: Students 
deserve all-you-can eat dining
It is unfortunate that a university as 
well-respected as Carnegie Mellon 
cannot provide an all-you-can-eat din
ing hall for students. One year ago, 
the traditional Highlander cafeteria 
transitioned to an a-la-carte food 
establishment, and more recently was 
taken away. Now, the once-thriving 
area has been closed off to future 
occupants.
When Highlander became a-lacarte, the selection was extremely lim
ited, and was too expensive for stu
dents to have a healthy meal. The vast 
majority of dining halls at other uni
versities are able to provide quality 
amounts of food for an affordable 
price.
An on-campus all-you-can-eat din
ing hall is a place for students to 
gather and build a community  
especially for first-years. At 
Carnegie Mellon, first-year students 
are already confused regarding their 
dining options when they arrive, and 
most are surprised and disappointed 
that a typical cafeteria is not a dining 
option.
According to a recent survey by the
Student Dormitory Council and 
Student Senate, most students seem 
displeased with vendors on campus. 
There is less pressure for the vendors 
to draw business by producing good 
food, particularly since first-year stu
dents are required to purchase a 
$3,200 meal plan before setting foot 
on campus.
It may have been financially impos
sible to keep Highlander operating in 
its previous state, but the University 
continues to lose money by merely 
maintaining the space.
Presently one on-campus vendor, 
Taste of India, occupies a small space 
in Highlander, and it would be wise 
for the Dining Services to continue to 
make space available to private ven
dors  especially those which could 
provide healthy and inexpensive 
meals to students. Ideally, these 
would be temporary remedies, and 
the University should ultimately ful
fill its responsibility to provide stu
dents with an establishment that 
offers nutritious food at a low cost by 
working on a plan to bring a tradi
tional dining hall back to campus.

Carnegie Mellon must revise 
illegal final examination policy
This December, Carnegie Mellon 
University will again violate its own final 
examination policy, while inconve
niencing students traveling home for 
break and taking away valuable study 
time allotted for students under the pol
icy. According to official rules on under
graduate examinations, The 
Universitys official final examination 
period begins on the Monday immedi
ately following the last day of classes. 
Despite the official policy, the University 
will hold its first final exam just 36 
hours after the last scheduled class 
ends. This adjustment to the calendar is 
an outrage given that under official pol
icy, students are guaranteed at least 62 
hours between the last scheduled class 
and the first final examination.
Further, students and professors 
traveling long distances are doubly 
inconvenienced. Finals end on 
December 20, the eve of one of the 
busiest and most expensive travel 
weekends of the year. Those traveling 
abroad to places like South America, 
the Middle East, Europe, and Asia do 
not have the sort of travel choice as a 
student traveling home to New York or 
even California. In the wake of an 
industry-wide slowdown, several air
lines have cancelled international 
flights on Saturdays and Sundays. 
This means that students or profes
sors, dealing with late finals, may not 
be able to leave until Monday, 
December 23  two days after campus 
dorms close  and would not arrive 
home until late Christmas Eve. This is 
assuming that there are no mechani
cal, weather, or security delays. Still,
with or without the current state of the 
airline industry, the schedule ends too 
late to make travel convenient for all.
If the University acts quickly, it can 
have time to turn around its final 
examination schedule for next fall 
when it is scheduled to again violate 
the very policies it designed in stu
dents interests. Many students would 
consider giving up a day of mid-semester break in order to have a more rea
sonable final examination policy, and 
the two days of classes at the end of 
the semester  on Monday and 
Tuesday  could be eliminated as 
well. With the adjustment of these 
three days, the University could end 
finals at a far more reasonable time  
a week before Christmas, rather than 
just four days. Students would have 
more time to get home in the less busy 
mid-week travel period rather than 
during the peak weekend period.
In short, the Universitys final exam 
policy is appalling and poorly thoughtout, with little consideration for many 
students and faculty. The University 
must quickly reconsider and revise its 
policies to suit the needs of the stu
dents. Students should speak out  
they should talk to their Senators and 
teachers.
Finally, students and professors alike 
should contact University officials 
such as Vice President of Enrollment 
Bill Elliott, Dean Michael Murphy, and 
directors of Enrollment John 
Papinchak and Linda Anderson, voic
ing their concerns with the 
Universitys incomprehensible double 
standards.

It happened again
Editor,
Last year there were a lot of issues deal7 
ing with the Phi Kappa Theta fraternity, 
especially the ones which forced UDC tri
als on supposed drug charges of growing, 
selling, distributing, and using (or abus
ing?) drugs. Some of these trials caused 
Phi Kap to lose their house, almost lose 
their charter, and lose the ability to par
ticipate in the big three (Greek Sing, 
Booth, and Buggy).
The supposed current status of the is 
that they are now allowed to participate
in the big three AND they are going to be 
getting their house back on the fraternity 
quad for next year. Well, this last 
Saturday night was the annual fall formal 
for Phi Kap, held at Wyndham Garden 
Hotel. The esteemed fraternity which has 
had everything go their way, was kicked 
out for many underage brothers trying to 
purchase/drink alcohol with fake IDs. 
Now, again they are causing problems 
and these are reflecting poorly on our 
Greek community in addition to our cam
pus community.
Do you think it is fair they are allowed 
to participate in Greek Sing? In Booth? 
What about that they may indeed get 
their house back next year? I do not think
these decisions, to allow the Phi Kappa 
Theta fraternity out of punishment for 
wrong deeds, are a good way for our com
munity to espouse high ideals and pro
mote a healthy campus community. In 
fact, I would say they need to be punished 
more than having their house taken away 
 they should have been kicked off-cam
pus, removing recognition as a student 
organization. I am curious to what the 
campus community thinks of this situa
tion and if they indeed agree that Phi 
Kappa Theta does need to serve their 
time and punishment for (illegal) wrong
doings.

US Government trades privacy for power
CH IST A#0
Christian Restifo
When my editor originally asked for 
my column idea for this final issue of 
the semester, I said that I was going to 
write about President Bushs decision 
to use military tribunals to try foreign
ers accused of terrorist acts against the 
United States. While I considered it to 
be worst choice out of tribunals, regu
lar US courts, and international courts, 
I planned a lengthy discussion address
ing the many rocks and hard places 
Bush was finding himself.
That was my plan, of course, until 
NPR reported on a survey conducted by 
themeslves, the Kaiser Family 
Foundation, and Harvard Universitys 
Kennedy School of Government. 
Designed to ascertain the opinions of 
Americans regarding security and civil 
liberties, the results show that, overall, 
the average American is woefully igno
rant of the high price he or she is will
ing to pay for security.
Exploring topics ranging from 
expanded police powers to government 
restrictions of speech to views of Arabs 
and Muslims, the study shows that 
large portions of Americans eagerly 
wish to throw away the very freedoms 
that makes us Americans.
For example, in the area of the press, 
36 percent of respondents thought the 
government should be able to censor 
news stories that criticize the President. 
Forty percent felt that anti-war news 
stories were also fair game. Call me stu
pid and nave, but that sounds a great 
deal like the Taliban. Hmmm....
Even more outrageous is that 52 per
cent of people felt the government 
should have the power to stop the US 
media from publishing interviews with 
Osama bin Laden. Whos next after 
this? Arafat? Any Middle East leader 
who doesnt fully support the US
alliance? Arab-Americans opposed to 
military action?
In the arena of privacy, people sup
ported expanded powers in activities 
such as wiretaps, monitoring email and 
Internet activity, tracking credit card 
purchases, examining banking state
ments, and reviewing taxes. Sixty-eight 
percent felt the police should require a 
court order before doing this. I would 
call this a good thing except for the fact 
that 31 percent felt the police should 
not need a court order. Almost a third of 
Americans are willing to give the police 
carte blanche authority to rummage 
through the most private aspects of our 
lives, going on grand fishing expedi
tions in the name of national security.
Ironically, two thirds felt that such 
expanded powers would be used against 
innocent people. I still cannot reconcile 
these two diametrically opposed posi
tions. How can one support expanded 
police powers when one is certain they 
will be used on innocent people?
The responses to the possibility of 
these expanded powers being used for 
things other than terrorism provide the 
most chilling result. Sixty percent of 
people felt that it would be a good 
thing if these expanded powers were 
used to investigate non-terrorists such 
as drug users, anti-war protestors, anti
abortion forces, and the like. This flab
bergasts me. How anyone can claim 
that this would be a good thing is 
beyond me.
A few bright spots poked their heads 
through the pile of American igno
rance. Large majorities felt that Arab 
and Muslim Americans shared the 
views of the average American and 
did not support the causes or acts of 
terrorists. At least they arent overtly 
stereotyping anyone.
However, this cannot compensate for 
the fact that Americans almost whole
heartedly wish to exchange civil liber
ties for security. They feel as though it 
is some zero-sum game, a Scilla and 
Charibdis of rights and safety. And
they blatantly desire short term solu
tions at the cost of long term freedom 
and prosperity.
They should know better. Its an 
axiom that once government has won a 
far-reaching power, it becomes almost 
impossible to take it away. Im not talk
ing about minor things like requiring cat 
licensing in Pennsylvania. (I will admit, 
however, thats a symptom of the larger 
problem.) Im talking about the power 
to forcibly invade the private sphere of 
human interaction. Once such power is 
obtained, opponents must work very 
hard for many, many years to reverse it.
Sadly, Americas post-September 11 
mindset will only help solidify the gov
ernments quest for power. This war 
on terrorism can be expanded for as 
long as politically convenient. Any new 
power on the governments wish list 
simply falls under the well, we need to 
fight terrorism and protect America 
blank check. I hope and pray the 
Supreme Court, our last true defender 
of rights in this country, will teach 
Americans and Congress what the 
Constitution means. However, Im not 
holding my breath. In regards to police 
powers, its record is a mixed bag.
Those whove read my previous 
columns know I support our current 
actions in Afghanistan. If anything, I 
think weve been too nice. We should 
have started with a full scale invasion 
to lock down the country immediately. 
The acts of September 11 warrant such 
a definitive response.
However, its one thing to hunt down 
bin Laden and pals. Its another thing 
entirely to gut our own freedoms in the 
quest to make ourselves feel safe and 
secure. I dont know about you, but I feel 
neither safe nor free living in a country 
where 48 percent of people feel the gov
ernment can detain terrorist suspects 
indefinitely without charging them.

Playboy places hair color at the root of success 
McJajrf 6tatoi(
Michael Croland
Upon celebrating my 18th birthday 
recently, I purchased a few goodies to 
accompany my new age-induced legal 
eligibility, although the entire experi
ence seemed futile since I did not get 
carded. I bought a lottery ticket at the 
Uni-Mart on the corner of Forbes and S. 
Craig, a lighter at Entropy, and the 
December 2001 issue of Playboy at the 
otherwise righteous campus bookstore.
This issue of Playboy is only the second I 
have ever had; whereas this purchase I 
attributed to coming of age, the other 
one is from when I was 13, which is such 
a horny age that it is a sufficient alibi. 
From the two examples, I was disap
pointed, albeit not shocked, to discover 
an unfortunate theme.
Former Miss USA Shanna Moakler is 
Decembers Playmate of the Month, and 
while the nude images of her overshad
ow the terse prose, the large title does 
indeed stand out: Blonde Victory. The 
article does not discuss the superficiali
ty of her hair color, but merely implies 
that being blonde has had something to
do with her success as a model, actor, 
and human being. A picture of her wear
ing the Miss USA crown contradicts the 
desired theme, as the only victory 
mentioned was accomplished without 
being blonde!
The September 1997 issue of Playboy 
includes a cover and feature story titled 
Blonde Ambition about both Jenny 
McCarthy and Pamela Anderson Lee, 
the two biggest names in modeling in 
the last decade. The title of the article is 
derived from a former Madonna tour, as 
Playboy attributes the singers success to 
when she dyed her hair blonde.

Toughen up: Democrats need to strengthen their positions
David M. Anderson
Thankfully, life is slowly beginning to 
return to normal. Several of my professors 
believe that I am taking only their class 
this semester, so I should not complain 
about spending thirty-three hours this 
weekend on their project alone. Im 
approaching the traditional flat broke 
period that always happens to me near 
Christmas (I get the presents, everyone 
else gets screwed) and I am trying to find 
a way to avoid my yearly contortionist 
exhibition on Greyhound. Life is returning 
to normal, both here at CMU and in the 
political world.
Senator Leahy(D-Vt.) is chairman of the 
Senate Judiciary Committee. His commit
tee is in charge of the first round of vetting 
judicial nominations, and also supervising 
the law enforcement agencies of the 
United States, including the Attorney 
Generals office. He has scheduled a series 
of hearings that will examine the constitu
tionality of some of the more recent anti
terrorist pronouncements coming from 
Attorney General Ashcroft. The goal of 
these hearings are to examine why some 
measures, such as the tapping of previous
ly confidential attorney-client conversa
tions and the secretive detention of hundreds of people since September 11, have 
occurred. These are legitimate questions, 
for Congress has a responsibility to coun
terbalance the executive branch, and the 
executive branch has gone too far in the 
name of national security.
These hearings will also serve another 
purpose; to begin to illustrate the differ
ences between the Democratic Party and 
the Republican Party in preparation for the
2002 election season. The Attorney 
General is the intended target against 
which the Democrats will contrast their 
opposition because they perceive him as 
too much of an authoritarian. The 
Democrats realize that public critiques and 
divergences of opinions against President 
Bush are not advisable at this time because 
he currently enjoys a wartime popularity 
surge. So they have decided to highlight 
their differences at other levels. I think that 
they will be extremely successful as they 
do so.
The Democratic Party has to take a more 
aggressive domestic policy line in prepara
tion for the 2002 elections. These hear
ings are the start. Democrats have to real
ize several important facts that work to 
their advantage. First, the American peo
ple as a whole trust the Democrats more 
on issues such as the economy, Social 
Security, health care, education, and a 
larger, more activist government. 
Secondly, the Democrats have the power
ful issue of the deficit. I am not sure if it
would be advisable to bring this issue out 
next year, but it will be used in 2004. The 
Republicans have been able to make a 10 
year surplus into a three or four year pro
jected deficit in only ten months. Were the 
tax cuts to the wealthy and Republican 
campaign contributors really worth 
endangering the overall financial stability 
of the United States? I do not think so. As 
a final point on the issues agenda, Senate 
Democrats have shown a willingness to 
compromise in order to accomplish some
thing. Compare this to the House 
Republican leadership.
Beyond these issue advantages, the 
Democratic Party has several other 
advantages that it needs to mobilize and 
use in order to regain power in the House 
of Representatives next year. The tradi
tional base of the party is extremely 
pissed off concerning the Florida fiasco. 
The base has been energized and united 
as the Nader factions on the whole realize 
that there is a discernable difference 
between a Democrat who has a chance of 
winning and almost any non-northeastern Republican. Secondly, the poor econ
omy has created a new set of immediate 
expectations for the median voter. 
During the 90s, everyone was either 
making a lot of money, or thinking that 
they could make a ton of money. An atti
tude of minimal government and maxi
mum freedom of economic activity 
allowed the Republicans to gain support.
Now, in more uncertain economic times, 
the expectation is that jobs could be lost 
next week, and that leads to a greater 
willingness to support government-spon
sored aid to the poor and the out of luck. 
People can see themselves in the shoes of 
the poor, in the shoes of those who might 
need help, and no longer see themselves 
owning three BMWs and the seventh 
home in Aspen. There are more reason
able expectations in society, and the 
Democrats are better positioned to take 
advantage of the situation.
The Democrats need to continue to 
pound on the significant policy differences 
between the parties. If they do so, they 
should be able to take control of both hous
es of Congress next year. Once they are in 
control, the failures of the past decade can 
be corrected. We do not need to spend bil
lions on the boondoggle of missile defense, 
and welfare can be re-reformed so that 
costs can be contained without perma
nently screwing people who are structural
ly poor. A new vision needs to be promot
ed: one that includes everyone instead of 
just the richest 10 percent. The Democrats 
are not perfect, but they are superior to the 
dominant ideological strains of the 
Republican party.

Looking for answers in all the wrong places: Pacifism hurts, not helps
Yaron Rachlin
Walking without a male chaperone, 
women in Afghanistan no longer need to fear 
a physical assault. Educational institutions 
catering to Afghan women that were driven 
underground by Taliban rule have now 
resurfaced. The voice of Afghan women can 
now be heard on television in Kabul. If the 
United States had listened to the pacifist 
voices raised around the country, as well as 
on our campus and city, the reality of the lib
eration of Afghan women would still be a 
dream, something we would have to beg the 
generous Taliban to grant. Perhaps unwit
tingly, those who participated in the anti-war 
marches acted as uncomprehending instru
ments for the continued oppression of 
women, and the brutal imprisonment of an 
entire nation by foreign thugs.
In 1942 George Orwell wrote in the 
Partisan Review of Great Britains pacifists:
Pacifism is objectively pro-Fascist. This is 
elementary common sense. If you hamper 
the war effort of one side you automatically 
help out that of the other. Nor is there any 
real way of remaining outside such a war as 
the present one. In practice, he that is not 
with me is against me. 
Muslim fundamentalists declared war 
against the US in a murderous manner. The 
terrorists wish the United States to buckle, to 
sue for peaceful solutions by adapting its for
eign policy to match their desires. Such an 
action would present weakness; it would 
only encourage further attacks as an effec
tive means to assert power over a timid and 
dispirited superpower. American civilians 
would bear the cost. Using Orwells logic, 
since the terrorists wish the US not to fight, 
and the pacifists wish the US not to fight, 
those marching in the anti-war rally are 
objectively pro-terrorist.
Beyond abetting the goals of terrorists, 
there is an element of elitist hypocrisy in the 
anti-war marches. In The Gathering Storm, 
Winston Churchill warned, Still, if you will 
not fight for the right. . . when your victory
will be sure and not too costly, you may come 
to the moment when you will have to fight 
with all odds against you and only a precari
ous chance of survival. If the pacifist argu
ments were taken seriously at a policy level 
the US would over time concede away its 
strength to its enemies. Most of the anti-war
that if German grievances could be 
addressed, the momentum of war could be 
stopped. Germany did have legitimate griev
ances, but they were merely a prelude to its 
evil ambitions. When Chamberlain returned 
from Munich, he was greeted as a hero who 
had averted war, though in reality his conMahatma Gandhi stated, If we are to have real 
peace, we must begin with the children.  
Palestinian children are raised on a diet of hate.
demonstrators would not enjoy living under 
Taliban rule or other foreign authoritarian 
occupation, in a country unable to defend 
itself from repeated violence against innocent 
civilians, or worse yet under a nuclear threat 
from countries such as Iraq. Pacifists preach 
against making war in safety, without ever 
having to bear the cost of their ideals. The 
lower class people that comprise the bulk of 
our armed forces give them this luxury.
Hypocrisy and the practical effects of aid
ing terrorists aside, is the anti-war message 
justified? Pacifists strenuously argue that 
violence only begets more violence. They 
claim that a vigorous response only 
enhances the motivation of your enemy to 
commit violent acts. To imply that Osama bin 
Laden and Muslim fundamentalists around 
the Middle East need any more motivation to 
strike out against The Great Satan suggests 
that one has not spent a decent amount of 
time reading the Arab press, listening to 
Muslim clerics, or watching broadcasts from 
stations such as A1 Jazeera. On September 
17, 2001, the Hamas Movement mouthpiece 
Al-Risala, published in Gaza, contained this 
statement, Allah has answered our prayers; 
the sword of vengeance has reached America 
and will strike again and again. Such state
ments are not uncommon. So what is the 
alternative to determined self-defense? The 
pacifist answer: redressing the grievances of 
your attacker.
Empirically speaking, resolving conflicts 
via negotiated concessions has sometimes 
proven successful among democratic states. 
However the history of appeasing militant 
ideologues and totalitarian regimes is less 
encouraging. On the eve of the outbreak of 
World War II, Neville Chamberlain believed
cessions only gave the German leadership 
confidence to act further in the face of 
Western powers that could not stomach a 
vigorous response to fascist ideals. Just as 
the world took comfort in the temporary 
appeasement of Nazi Germany, the same 
mentality now urges Israel to give up land to 
militant Palestinians in return for peace. As 
before, pacifists focus on the grievances of 
the attacker, but turn a blind eye to his ambi
tions and the suffering of the attacked.
Mahatma Gandhi stated, If we are to 
have real peace, we must begin with the 
children. Palestinian children are raised 
on a steady diet of hate. In early September
2000, the Palestinian Authority issued 15 
new textbooks, comprising the full curricu
la for grades one through six. A banner on 
the title page of Volume I states, There is 
no alternative to destroying Israel. From 
the introduction to Volume II we read, 
Perhaps Allah brought the Jews to our 
land so that their demise would be here, as 
it was in their wars with Rome. Aisheh, a 
mother of six in Tulkarm, states in an inter
view (USA Today, Dec. 8, 2000), We dont 
want to send our sons to the front line, but 
they are taken by the Palestinian Authority 
... When school finishes, Palestinian 
Authority security cars go around collect
ing children from the streets and sending 
them to the killing fields.
Perhaps pacifists ought to consider march
ing against the Muslim militants that terror
ize the minds and bodies of Palestinian kids 
and Afghan women.

SAY WHAT?
This weeks guest writer:
Jodi Lynn Poniewaz
Dont forget the toys
Ive never been the sort of person to keep a day runner, 
ever aware of exactly how many days remain until an antic
ipated event. I tend to think of dates in a more relaxed fash
ion. Everything is either a long way off, or its tomorrow. 
Consequently, I have no idea of when Christmas season 
ought to start, but I am finding myself in the midst of a hol
iday I was pretty sure was still a long ways off. I havent even 
finished breaking out from all the Halloween candy I ate and 
toy circulars are being shoved in our front door. Ive spent 
the past ten years or so hating these circulars and all the 
commercial aspects of Christmas that they represent. This 
year, however, I find myself looking at these circulars in a 
new light, thinking of the fun the adults in my family, are 
going to have buying Christmas toys for my nieces first 
Christmas. All right, Im lying. Im really having fun thinking 
of the toys Id ask for myself if I were still a kid.
' Having something of an excuse to look through toy adver
tisements with a childs eyes is an experience Ive missed. Its 
amazing what sorts of toys kids can ask for these days. If I 
were a kid, Id ask for the portable cotton candy machine, 
the Surf Frogs frog habitat, and the Monsters, Inc. Splatter 
iDome. Id drop subtle hints about Radio Flyer pedal cars, but 
I wouldnt expect to actually get one. And Id probably make 
ithe same mistakes all over again by asking for toys that look 
cool but have been lame for decades.
How is it that lousy toys manage to stay on the market 
year after year? Everyone knows the kinds of toys I am talk
ing about. They are the sorts of toys that youd never think 
;to ask for on your own, but once you see them in the Sears 
catalog, you absolutely have to have them. One year I 
[received a rock tumbler. Although I had previously had no 
interest whatsoever in geology, as soon as I saw that rock 
tumbler, I had to have it. For Christmas that year, I got a rock 
tumbler. I got right to work combining rocks, water, and pol
ishing salts. My mother helped me turn the machine on, and 
for two minutes we stood watching it. I consulted the direc
tions. Allow rocks to tumble 2-3 weeks. I looked at my 
mother. The thunderous whir of the motor shook the walls 
of our living room. My mother suggested we move the rock 
tumbler to the basement, where it was placed under a box 
and several beach towels. It spins there to this day....
One year, I asked for a woodburning kit. Woodburning 
kits, for those of you who have never had one, are lame. For 
40 years, that kid on the box has been tricking kids every
where into thinking they, too, would soon be turning out 
works of art on par with the masters. The directions made 
the craft of woodburning seem easy. It would, in fact, have 
been easy had the tool enclosed actually gotten hot enough 
to burn Styrofoam, let alone wood. After struggling to burn a 
few faint lines into a cheap piece of wood, the woodburning 
kit was quickly banished to our basement closet. It landed 
beside the battery-powered pottery wheel whose motor 
stopped if too much pressure was applied to its surface. Being 
that the clay that was included with the wheel was about as 
pliable as asphalt, the pottery wheels life was a short one.
Our basement closet contained quite an assortment of 
toys my brother and I hated. Our family wasnt the only one 
with this problem. One year, my friend Renee begged for, 
and received, an inflatable tent. We took turns blowing it up, 
then hopped inside our inflatable hideout. It quickly grew 
hot inside. Static electricity made our hair stand on end. 
Stuffiness shortened our tempers until we began bickering 
and finally relieved our aggression by popping the tent. 
Inflatable playsets are once again beckoning from toy circu
lars, luring yet another generation of starry-eyed children 
into madness.
This is not to say that horrible toys never die, or at least 
improve. The razor-sharp Erector sets of my fathers genera
tion were replaced with safer versions. The original handcranked Baby Alive, more inclined to spit than swallow, was 
eventually replaced by a battery-powered model. Buzzy the 
Cookie Crafter, a toy which was supposed to turn graham 
crackers into edible works of art but usually managed only 
to crumble them, went off the market shortly after it went 
on. Improvements do happen.
But Woodburning kits, rock tumblers, and pottery 
wheels continue to taunt children, along with chemistry 
sets that dont do anything, microscopes that only let you 
see your eyelashes, and cars that wont stay on the race 
tracks they came with. Nothing is ever quite as big, or quite 
as sturdy, or quite as much fun as the kid in the ad makes 
it look. I guess the real reason Christmas lists get shorter as 
you grow older is because you no longer believe everything 
in the toy catologs. Or maybe it really is because Christmas 
means more than seeing how many toys you can amass 
once youre old enough to really appreciate the value of 
families being together.
Whatever the cause, I urge anyone needing a break in this 
time of final papers and final exams to try looking through a 
toy catalog as if you were a little kid again. Make a list. 
Check it twice. Send it to the South Pole. Just keep in mind 
while youre doing it all the lame toy lessons from your own 
childhood, and remember them when the time comes that 
you have little kids to shop for.
Happy holidays, CMU!

Blonder the better? Hair color should not be grounds for pop cultures pedestal
CROLAND, from page A6 
Contrary to the current issue of the mag
azine, this one extends far beyond the 
articles title in putting blondes on 
a pedestal.
The bias toward blondes in Blonde 
Ambition is best demonstrated by a 
string of superficial quotes found within 
the article and its captions to pictures: 
Americas love affair with golden girls 
finds new life in Jenny and Pam; 
Bombshells come in only one color; 
Theres just something compelling 
about sun-kissed hair; Jenny
goodness that some of those roots are 
blonde; and finally, So, with apologies 
to the ravenand red-haired, we salute 
Pam and Jenny.
I find these quotes to be flawed with
out even analyzing their shallowness. 
Firstly, while Blonde Ambition is 
happy to purport that some of our coun
trys roots are blonde, it also contains 
the extremely offensive anecdote of how 
Jenny McCarthy became a blonde. She 
was born with white hair, and according 
to McCarthy herself, by eighth grade I 
was a full brunette. Yuck! Disgusting.
Playboy is not even adulating actual blondes, 
not that this would be an improvement, but 
instead pushing forward the notion that people 
who dye their hair can instantly achieve beauty.
McCarthy is the most famous blonde in 
America. Pamela Anderson Lee is the 
most famous blonde on the planet. 
Jenny and Pam. Pam and Jenny. In a cul
ture forever in search of its roots, thank
With her mother, a hairdresser, she 
experimented before inevitably discov
ering, as the article proclaims, the per
fect golden hue. Playboy is not even 
adulating actual blondes, not that this
would be an improvement, but instead 
pushing forward the notion that people 
who dye their hair can instantly achieve 
beauty. This just praises and encourages 
those who are addicted to the bottle! 
Also, I would like to note that I do not 
accept the articles apology as a sincere 
or adequate one for promoting such irre
sponsible shallowness.
Playboy has featured a plethora of 
blondes since its beginning, as Marilyn 
Monroe appeared in the magazines first 
issue in the 1950s and the trend has con
tinued since. The magazine includes 
many more blondes, whether or not they 
are natural, than women with any other 
hair color. The magazine has also fea
tured significantly more Caucasian mod
els than members of any other race. 
Hugh Hefners vision of the girl next 
door is from the perspective of a man 
who lives in a surreal mansion in an 
exclusive, pretentious, and wealthy 
community unrepresentative of the 
United States. And of course, the entire 
idea of selling ones private and nude 
image is seen as perverse and inappro
priate by many.
As disgustingly culpable as Playboy is, 
the magazine alone cannot be blamed
for the pedestals of blondes in pop cul
ture. Other magazines, both those that 
feature nude models and those intended 
for teenagers interested in style and 
fashion, are equally responsible, as are 
Hollywood, EmptyV, and most of the 
media, entertainment, and advertising 
businesses that contribute to pop-culture. Even markets oriented for young 
children, such as Barbie dolls, instill this 
preference of hair color in vulnerable 
minds. Innumerable influences try to 
raise blondes to a level above everyone 
else. Negative stereotypes of ditziness 
and promiscuity are irrelevant and do 
not resolve the problem.
I personally do not think even external 
beauty, a small component of the overall 
picture, can be measured by the color of 
ones hair. I do find that hair is often a 
beautiful feature of ones appearance, 
but this is not determined exclusively 
and uniformly by such characteristics as 
color, or even style or length. Being nat
ural and true to ones self is what I deem 
beautiful, and while efforts to improve 
ones appearance should not be com
pletely dismissed for vanity, they are 
not priorities.
Equating beauty with a hair color,
especially one obtained largely by dyes, \ 
is a gross misconception prevalent j 
throughout our society as a result of! 
Playboy and the rest of pop-culture. If 
someone is in love or lust with a hair 
color, as I suggested in my short story 
D(f, that person should just purchase 
a wig, or even a container of hair dye. 
Allowing the receptacle to lie on his 
bureau will surely satisfy any superficial 
fantasies. I have no quarrel with people 
who dye their hair, whether with natur
al colors for cosmetic purposes or with 
the rainbows palette for such reasons as 
self-expression, standing out, or plain 
fun. The problem lies with pop culture 
falsely inculcating us that women who 
want to be perceived as beautiful must 
be blonde, and that dying ones hair 
must be done if this step is not naturally 
achieved. Victory and ambition can
not be gained by a hair color, and it is 
strictly superficial and wrong to believe 
and purport that beauty can be 
so determined.

THE INTERVIEW: Ken Gabriel
interview by Akhil Wable
;Ph(oto courtesy of Carnegie Mellon News
Kaigham (Ken) J. Gabriel is a professor of electrical and computer engineering and robotics 
at'.Carnegie Mellon University, and the newly appointed director of the Security Technologies 
Office (STO). Here he talks about what the creation of the STO will mean for Carnegie 
Mellon and the rest of the nation.
The Tartan (TT): Dr. Gabriel, you 
were recently appointed the director 
for the Security Technologies Office. 
The initial plan was to actually 
establish an Institute for National 
Security Research. Why exactly did 
we back down from this plan?
Ken Gabriel (KG): Many reasons, I 
think. The principle one is that after 
exploring and thinking about what the 
University has to offer, what the mission of 
the University is, and its scope, it was more 
appropriate to not so much create a new 
institute that is a traditional academic 
activity, but rather just find a way that 
would couple the ongoing activities, to see 
if there are relevant results and expertise 
that we can put to the benefit of strength
ening our defenses, or securing a better 
protection, rather than necessarily taking 
on that as the principle objective.
TT: Did it have anything to with 
the fact that there might be a ter
rorist threat if we do put up a fullfledged institute?
KG: I dont think that was an immediate 
concern, but I think as things have settled 
out, that is a remote concern, and one that 
is not the principle reason. It has more to 
do with what we believe is the traditional 
and appropriate role for what a university 
can contribute at times like this.
TT: But wouldnt you say that 
Carnegie Mellon is involved at a 
higher level than most other peo
ple, and that we are one of the main 
hubs for National Security Research 
because of the amount of resources
we utilize for this type of research?
KG: Its not really research, and I think 
the right way to put it, is that we are one 
of the top schools in the country in areas 
of information technology, data mining, 
robotics, networking, and things in elec
trical and computer engineering, and as 
such our research is advanced in systems 
capabilities to the extent that we are rec
ognized for that. We do get significant 
funding from the government to support 
these research areas, but its not that we 
are being funded fundamentally for 
research reasons. Were being funded to 
extend our system capabilities. We are 
experts in these areas, and our expertise 
is being drawn upon. Its not that we are 
doing work directly at national security. 
Theres a subtle distinction but an impor
tant one.
TT: So what would you say are the 
objectives for the Security 
Technologies Office, and what are 
its future plans?
KG: Let me start of by saying what the 
Security Technologies Office (STO) is 
not. Its not a traditional organizational 
institutional academic activity. Its not 
about doing research for security tech
nology, but rather a coupling mechanism 
between what are the traditional 
University activities, long-term research, 
educational mission, and looking at 
activities resources and people that are 
in the University, and then recognizing 
and understanding the needs of the 
country at the moment. Those needs are 
very specific, critical and have been 
rapidly evolving over the last month. And
so, its a way to look at what we are 
experts at, look at our activities and ? 
capabilities, and see if there is a way for  
us to help the government to do what it! 
needs to do at this time. The STO is not 
about going down to Washington and 
bringing back lots of money to do securi
ty research. Its about looking at what we 
already have, coupling the right kind of 
people and then handing them off to the 
government and letting the government 
do what it needs to do with those capa
bilities and expertise, as opposed to nec
essarily having those activities done here 
on campus.
TT: You emphasized the fact that 
we must recognize what the country 
needs right now, but would you con
sider the sudden craze about 
National Security to be hype? Taking 
STO as an example ... is it going to 
be a permanent organization?
DG: I certainly hope not. The analogy 
in my mind, without being melodramat
ic, would be the situation just after Pearl 
Harbor. A time when the country tries to 
respond the best way it can to a situation 
it never thought it would have to respond 
to. Its not so much a hype as it is a reac
tion to an unexpected event. But over 
time, as the situation hopefully 
improves, in the long term you will find 
that from a security perspective we will 
become a little stronger, but I certainly 
pray and hope, still not lose the elements 
of a free society that we enjoy here. So I 
certainly hope that the STO will, as the 
country looks to other approaches, not 
be needed anymore.

On the outside, it's easy to see that Celica is race-track - inspired. But the real excitement is on the inside...under the hood. Take the Celica GT-S...Toyota worked with Yamaha to build a 180 HP engine redlined at 7800 RPM...equipped it with Variable Valve Timing with intelligence...a computer that constantly monitors and retunes your engine for maximum performance...a cam with two sets of lobes to provide two ranges of valve lift and duration for more usable horsepower. There's direct ignition for greater reliability... iridium-tipped spark plugs for reduced maintenance...a stainless steel exhaust manifold...a water-cooled oil cooler. And mated with Toyota's 4-speed electronically-controlled automatic "Sportshift", you get transmission shift switches on the steering wheel...just like Formula 1 race cars. Sweet

THE TARTAN  DECEMBER 3, 2001Ail
Colorados Big 12 title win provides excitement Mens basketball team
drops two on the road
COLORADO, from page A12 
Colorado has the ball deep in 
Longhorn territory. Chris Simmss 
huge error puts the Buffs right back 
in this one. Lets punch this thing 
in.
8:45 pm: TOUCHDOWN, COL
ORADO! 7-7. On 3rd-and-8 from 
the 10 yard line, Chris Brown gets 
every yard possible. This things all 
squared, and-we can thank Simms 
for that one. A gift TD turns this 
game in Colorados favor the way 
Texas did back in the first game. 
Simms has got to be peeved, so 
Colorado needs to weather this 
next series.
8:49 pm: Texas 3 and out. 
Colorado needs to respond now 
and make these Longhorns eat it. 
Just noticed theyre not wearing 
the all-black digs that demolished, 
Nebraska. Gold and black is much 
better.
8:56 pm: Colorado field goal. 
10-7. Colorados showing their 
game. Hope this gets out of hand 
soon. Its too intense right now.
9:01 pm: INTERCEPTION, COL
ORADO! Lets go for the kill now. 
KILL!
9:06, pm: TOUCHDOWN, COL
ORADO! 16-7. Some people are 
shocked right now. But why? This 
is just how Texas won the first 
game, by forcing and capitalizing 
on turnovers. But oh boy, that was 
a pretty gruesome miss on the extra 
point. Lets hope that doesnt come 
back to haunt the Buffs.
9:19 pm: Texas field goal. 16-10. 
That was some kick  50 freaking
yards!
9:26 pm: Interception, Texas. 
Very well defended by Texas. This 
team is very solid, and Colorado is 
going to lose on some of those gam
bles.
9:27 pm: FUMBLE RECOVERY, 
COLORADO! The very next play, 
Colorado gets the ball after 
Simmss third turnover of the 
game. Lets break these Longhorns. 
Major Applewhite could be warm
ing up soon....
9:28 pm: TOUCHDOWN, COL
ORADO ! 22-10. The very next play, 
tight end Graham goes in for a 
wide-open gift touchdown. Talk 
about an incredible three-play 
sequence. Lets hope that dropped 
two-point conversion doesnt cost 
them, though.
9:32 pm: TOUCHDOWN, COL
ORADO! 29-10! Chris Simmss 
FOURTH turnover is returned 
directly for a touchdown! Looks 
like this games gonna be over 
early. Just like last week. What a 
beautiful game!
9:36 pm: Major Applewhite 
relieves Chris Simms. Not a bad 
backup situation  one of the best 
Big 12 passers, ever. Hope CU has 
one more play in them on defense 
to put this game away early.
9:39 pm: Touchdown, Texas. 
29-17. Oh boy, on 3rd and long 
Colorado gets burned deep. This is 
trouble. Colorado needed one play. 
Just ONE play ... DAMN.
9:46 pm: End of the first half. 
Well, this thing isnt over, not by a
long shot. Major Applewhite looks 
like hes up for a legendary come
back.
10:11 pm: Colorado gets the ball 
for the first time in the 2nd half 
after a Texas punt. With great field 
position, its dagger time.
10:14 pm: TOUCHDOWN, COL
ORADO! 36-17. Another Chris 
Brown run, another touchdown. 
With nine touchdowns in his last 
two games, this guys got it going. 
And the game is almost well in 
hand.
10:24 pm: Ho-hum, Texas field 
goal. 36-20. Its still a two-score 
game, and thats going up on the 
next Colorado drive.
10:38 pm: Texas misses a field 
goal with eighteen minutes left in 
the game. Colorado just needs to 
score here and ice this baby.
10:46 pm: End of the third. Hold 
out for fifteen minutes and the Big
12 title is ours! Just 900 seconds 
left...
10:55 pm: Texas kicks a field 
goal to make a two-score game a ... 
two-score game. How exciting. 
36-23 Buffs.
11:03 pm: Touchdown, Texas. 
36-30. Interception returned for a 
touchdown on a 4th-down TRICK 
PLAY by Colorado, and this is a 
game again. What a terrible, terri
ble call. At least the Buffs get the 
ball back....
11:11 pm: Buffs go for it on 4th 
down again, and make it this time. 
Coach Barnett must be trying to
give us all heart attacks.
11:20 pm: Field goal, Colorado. 
39-30. Two score game again. 
Pretty much iced. One play and 
Colorados got the Big 12, sending 
either Oregon or Tennessee (or 
even Nebraska) to the Rose Bowl. 
Fantastic!
Thank the officials for that cor
rect call on roughing the kicker, 
which allowed the drive to continr 
ue.
11:35 pm: Touchdown, Texas. 
39-37. With 31 seconds left, they 
need a prayer at this point. With no 
timeouts left, this is still clearly 
well in hand for Colorado.
11:37 pm: COLORADO RECOV
ERS the onside kick. Game over! 
Colorado is the Big 12 champion 
for the first time ever! And Texas is 
dead.
Note: This edition of my column 
was written during a very impor
tant game in the Colorado 
Buffaloes season. I have been a fan 
of the Buffs for years, even though 
I havent actually lived in Colorado 
since 1990 (break out the hypocrite 
comments!).
The idea of the column was to 
verbalize the emotions presented 
during a critical game involving my 
favorite team. The format this week 
may suck, but so what? It was a 
way for this columnist to do two 
things at once (write a column and 
watch a big game), so whats it to 
you?
RJ Sikdar is taking the JAGUARS 
on Monday Night. Hes still 0-fer on 
the year, and is content to stay that 
way.
9:19 pm: Texas field goal. 16-10. 9:46 pm: End or the first halt, down again, and make it this time, the year, ana is content to stay that
That was some kick  50 freaking Well, this thing isnt over, not by a Coach Barnett must be trying to way.
Jordan may miss first games due to knee injury
WASHINGTON (AP)  Given the the second of two games he missed player, Collins said. But I saw him try to learn to play with the returnphysical setbacks he suffered over while hospitalized with a foot infecstop a couple of times, just shoot his ing superstar.
WASHINGTON (AP)  Given the 
physical setbacks he suffered over 
the summer, it seemed rather ambi
tious when Michael Jordan said he 
planned to play every game this sea
son. That plan already is in jeopardy.
After just 16 games, Jordan can 
barely practice and was dominated 
down the stretch Saturday night by 
Orlandos Tracy McGrady. Jordans 
right wrist and both knees have been 
ailing, but it is soreness and swelling 
in the right knee that prompted him 
to schedule an appointment Sunday 
with a doctor in Chicago.
I just developed some-fluid on my 
knee, and I think its about time to 
pay attention to it so it wont linger 
all season long, Jordan said. I dont 
think its going to be something 
thats going to linger. I have to make 
sure theres no ligament damage, 
and get it treated, get it drained, and 
see what the doctors say I have to do 
and see if I can get rid of it.
Jordan has already had the knee 
drained once this season. He last 
missed a game due to injury on 
March 5,1993, against San Antonio,
the second of two games he missed 
while hospitalized with a foot infec
tion.
The Wizards next opponent: San 
Antonio again. A four-game road trip 
starts Tuesday, and Jordan said he 
might have to sit out a game or two if 
the Wizards team doctor and the 
doctor in Chicago agree that its for 
the best.
Its early in the season. I dont 
want to. Id rather continue to play, 
Jordan said. But if its not going to 
get any better other than me sitting 
out  long-term, I want to play later 
in the season.
Jordan scored a season-low 15 
points in Saturday nights 96-87 loss 
to Orlando. Matched one-on-one 
against McGrady, Jordan was 2-for12 in the second half, missed all four 
shots he took in the fourth quarter 
and was taken out by coach Doug 
Collins with 3:50 to play and the 
Wizards trailing by 13.
He would have played until the 
end of the game no matter what, 
because he. doesnt want to make it 
look like hes walking away from a
player, Collins said. But I saw him 
stop a couple of times, just shoot his 
jump shot, and its almost like he did
nt put the leg down. I said to the 
coaches, Thats it. 
McGrady scored 16 of his 26 
points in the second half in a muchanticipated matchup between 
Jordan and one of the young dogs 
he said would be chasing him this 
season. Jordan also missed a few 
minutes in the first half when his eye 
was poked while grabbing a 
rebound.
I got poked in the eye and my 
knees a litde sore. Is that why he 
took it easy on me? Jordan said. 
Obviously I felt it on my lift on my 
shot more than anything, and I did 
whatever I could to contain him in 
the second half.
Collins said Jordan had scheduled 
the trip to Chicago before Saturdays 
game, the Wizards fourth in five 
nights. The injury is not only ham
pering Jordans performance, its 
slowing the development of the 
team chemistry that needs to devel
op as the young Washington players
try to learn to play with the return
ing superstar.
Michael cant go through a full 
practice, Collins said. They dont 
get much practice time with MJ. 
Weve' got to keep him fresh for the 
game. I cant ask Michael to go 
through a 1 1/2 hour practice and 
ask him to play 35 minutes.
The rigors of an NBA schedule on 
Jordans 38-year-old body always 
seemed the biggest obstacle in his 
second comeback. He was slowed by 
back spasms, two cracked ribs, and 
knee tendinitis in workouts to get in 
shape over the summer. 
Nevertheless, he said he planned to 
play , all 82 regular season games 
when he announced his return.
Any decision to sit will be made by 
Jordan and the doctors. Collins said 
he would never make the suggestion 
himself.
Id never say that to Michael, 
Collins said. Michael taught me a 
long time ago, Never keep a thor
oughbred from running. Because at 
some point and time if you do, they 
wont want to run.

JACKETS, from page A12
the Yellowjackets.
Rochester began the game on a 
19-6 run, but the Tartans came 
back with a run of their own to 
close the game to three points at 
24-21. Kaitz and senior guard 
Dom Ionadi each scored five 
points in the 15-5 run.
The Tartans then proceeded to 
tie the game at 29 points after a 
series of free throws by Kaitz and 
Walters, and the first half ended 
with the Yellowjackets holding a 
mere three-point lead at 34-31.
Then the Yellowjackets fired 
back with a run of their own and 
seemingly put the game away 
with just over 11 minutes remain
ing.
However, Jason Walters led a 
second-half charge, scoring 13 
points as the Tartans cut a 63-42 
lead to 74-64 in a seven-minute 
span. However, the Tartans simply 
ran out of gas, as Rochester kept 
them at bay for the final five min
utes of the game.
Carnegie Mellon never led in 
the game, though the score was 
tied three times. The Tartans fastbreak game was nonexistent, and
the Tartans were dominated in 
the paint, 38-24. Rochester also 
led the Tartans in points off 
turnovers, 24-10, accounting for 
the final margin of the game.
The Tartans fell to 2-3 (0-1 
UAA) going into yesterdays 
matchup against Penn State 
University (Behrend).
Rochester improved to 7-0, as 
they won their ninth straight 
game dating back to the end of 
last season. The Yellowjackets 
could very well be ranked in the 
Division III top 25 with the win.
Unfortunately, the Tartans were 
unable to recover from the loss in 
time to deal with the Behrend 
Lions yesterday, ultimately falling 
by a score of 82-75.
However, their shooting was 
still respectable, as they sank 40 
percent from the field in each 
half. The Lions, however, bettered 
them by shooting 47.3 percent on 
the day, and dropped 36 points in 
the paint, compared to the 
Tartans 24.
The Tartans next match is this 
Wednesday evening, as they host 
Thiel College in Skibo 
Gymnasium. Game time is 7:30 
pm.

Big 12 win 
excites fans
120 Yards
by RJ Sikdar
The following events and 
thoughts took place on Saturday 
night. What follows is an edited 
chronology of conscious thoughts 
and the events that triggered them. 
If you watched the Colorado-Texas 
game, you may recognize some of 
these events. If you didnt, you 
might learn something. If you dont 
like football, read someone elses 
column.
7:04 pm: Turn on the television. 
Colorado is still in the national title 
hunt, but they need some help. 
Oregon must lose to Oregon State 
in the Civil War game and the 
Tennessee/Florida winner must 
lose in the SEC title game next 
week. Additionally, Colorado must 
beat Texas by enough so that they 
advance past Nebraska in the BCS 
standings. However, having lost to 
Texas in the first meeting in Austin 
by,a score of 41-7, Colorado will be 
hard-pressed to beat them at a 
neutral site in Dallas, Texas. All 
that said, this fan is confident that 
the Buffaloes can follow up one of 
the greatest victories in school his
tory (a 62-36 drubbing of 
Nebraska, breaking a ten-year los
ing streak to the Cornhuskers) and 
get into the Rose Bowl with major 
help from the BCS Gods.
7:47 pm: Oregon beats OSU. The 
Rose Bowl dream is over for 
Colorado. Now all they can do is 
ruin the title hopes of the Longhorn 
team that ruined their season in the 
first game.
7:55 pm: Tennessee beats
Florida. Texas is the new frontrunner for the #2 spot in the BCS, and 
the favorite to play Miami in the 
Rose Bowl for the national champi
onship. Clearly, Texas now has 
everything at stake in this Big 12 
Title Game, but Colorado is still up 
for it. It looks like Rex Grossman 
blew his shot at the Heisman tro
phy, too  its gotta be Ken Dorsey 
now, right?
8:22 pm: Touchdown, Texas. 
7-0. Its like dj vu all over again, 
back to the first game. But 
Colorado can rebound from this. 
They just need to regroup and 
recall their incredible performance 
last week. Back when Bobby Purify 
and Chris Brown ripped apart the 
#1 team in the land, back when 
Colorado scored the most points by 
any team ever against Nebraska. 
Those were the days. Bring back 
the glory days of Thanksgiving 
weekend....

Swimmers put in impressive showing at D-I meet
by Balaji Sarpeshkar
Sports Editor
After a strong start to their sea
son, the Carnegie Mellon mens 
and womens swim teams used the 
Thanksgiving break to get a wellearned vacation. In addition to get
ting some time off, of course, the 
rest allowed the swimmers to rest 
their bodies in preparation for the 
second half of the season, which 
promises to contain some strong 
competition, especially within the 
usually tight UAA.
The swimmers closed out the 
first half of their year this past 
weekend in slightly unorthodox 
fashion. CMU received invitations 
to two meets taking place over the 
weekend: the Longnecker
Invitational at Grove City College, 
and the Miami Invitational at the 
Miami University of Ohio.
Rather than choose one over the 
other, head coach David Belowich 
elected to split the teams into two 
groups, and send each to one of 
the two meets. In addition, 
because there were some Division I 
teams present at the Miami meet,
some of the Tartans had the oppor
tunity to face off against some elite 
competition.
It was a really good experience 
for everyone, said Belowich. Its 
wonderful to see that kind of com
petition.
While the Tartan contingent that 
traveled to Miami was unable to 
put up the kind of numbers they 
are accustomed to, they acquitted 
themselves well in the face of some 
intense competition. For example, 
present at the meet was Kenyon 
University, last years NCAA D-III 
tournament winner.
The team score wasnt really 
that important to us, said 
Belowich. Most of the schools 
there were D-I, and Emory and 
Hopkins were there as well.
The day started out slow, as 
none of the Tartans was able to 
crack even the top ten finishers in a 
race. That changed, however, 
when the relay team of sopho
mores Steve Chiou and Brian 
Jucha and seniors Sean Belowich 
and Matt Shewchuk won the 200 
yard medley relay outright, with a 
time of 1:34.52.
They would also pick up an
NCAA qualifying time in the event. 
Jucha would strike again later, tal
lying a ninth-place finish in the 
100 yard butterfly and garnering 
an NCAA cut.
Also having a good weekend was 
first-year Chris Pearson, who raced 
to a third-place finish in the 200 
yard freestyle, picking up an NCAA 
cut along the way, with his time of 
1:40.11.
Pearson would also get NCAA 
cuts in the 500 yard freestyle, 400 
individual medley (IM), 100
freestyle, and the 1650 freestyle. In 
addition, he set new school records 
in the 200 and 500 freestyle.
Also recording NCAA qualifying 
cuts were Belowich in the 100 yard 
backstroke and first-year Bobby 
Colyer in the 200 breaststroke. 
Also, Shewchuk set a new school 
record with his time of 21.12 in the 
50 yard freestyle.
On the womens side, there were 
no school marks set, but several of 
the Tartan swimmers tallied NCAA 
cuts. Especially strong was the 
relay team of sophomores Julie 
Tibor and Corey Ginsberg, junior 
Mei-Lan Ho-Walker, and first-year 
Kim Rapp, who earned cuts in both
the 200 and 400 yard freestyle 
relays.
Rapp would also record a B cut 
in the 100 freestyle for her leadoff 
time of 53.30 in the 400 relay. 
Finally, first-year Samantha 
Monda recorded a B cut in the 200 
yard butterfly.
Although the Tartans scores 
didnt compare to those of their 
competition, they still fared well 
against their D-I foes, as well as 
perennial UAA threats Emory and 
Johns Hopkins. At the end of the 
weekend, the team set five new 
school records, and got more than 
10 NCAA cuts.
We just had a really good 
meet, said coach Belowich.
On the other side, the squad that 
headed to Grove City was able to 
put on a good show, with the mens 
team taking the title, while the 
womens team finished a very 
respectable seventh.
While the mens chances were 
helped by the presence of sopho
more Brian McCarthy, who contin
ued his streal^ of setting a meet or 
pool record in each outing, several 
other swimmers also had a chance 
to come to the foreground.
For example, the relay team of 
first-years Derek Underwood and 
Luis Vega, sophomore Steve 
Clifford, and junior Duncan 
Carroll sped to a second-place fin
ish in the second event of the day, 
the 200 yard freestyle relay.
Later in the day, Clifford would 
break away from the pack, taking 
the 500 yard freestyle with a time 
of 4:53.27, a whopping five sec
onds better than his closest oppo
nent. More impressively, his time 
was a scant 25 hundredths of a sec
ond short of the meet record.
While the women didnt domi
nate the opposition like their male 
counterparts, they had several 
strong showings, including a fifthplace finish in the 200 yard indi
vidual medley (IM) by senior co
captain Sara Schultzer.
After this weekends action, the 
Tartans wont see any action until 
after the winter holidays, when 
they play host to Washington and 
Jefferson College in a dual meet on 
January 12.
After an impressive first half and 
a long break coming up, the 
Tartans should be ready to make a 
splash after the new year.

This past Saturday, December 
1, the 2-2 Carnegie Mellon 
Tartans traveled to New York to 
face the unbeaten University of 
Rochester Yellowjackets.
The Tartans hung around in the 
first half to keep it interesting, but 
the Yellowjackets began the sec
ond half with a 29-11 run that
pushed a three point lead to 21. 
The Yellowjackets withstood 
every Tartan run thereafter, as 
Rochester maintained a double
digit lead for the remainder of the 
game and won by a score of 
86-73.
The Tartans were led by sopho
more guard Matt Kaitz, who 
scored 19 points while pulling 
down four rebounds and record
ing two blocks. First-year guard 
Jason Walters added 16 points 
and two steals, and sophomore 
guard Nick Miller added 13
points. Miller and junior forward 
Ross Freeman also led the team in 
rebounds with six each.
The Yellowjackets were led by 
guards Tim Sweeney and Jeff 
Joss, who both scored 20 points. 
For the game, the Tartans shot a 
very solid 49 percent from the 
field, but they were overmatched 
by Rochesters 53.3 percent in 
that same department.
The Tartans were out-rebounded 35-27 and turned the ball over 
17 times  four more than did

Saturdays game against Rochester, she scored six points and had 10 rebounds.

Special Projects Manager
Trailing 54-53 in the closing 
minutes against conference oppo
nent University of Rochester on 
Saturday, the womens basketball 
team could not convert, and 
instead had to commit a flurry of 
desperation fouls which ultimately 
led to a tight 55-53 win for 
Rochester.
The Tartans got off to a good 
start, recording seven assists and 
seven field goals in the first seven 
minutes.
But Rochester pushed back hard, 
hitting two layups in one minute, 
and the Tartans called the first 
timeout of the game at 12:00 
remaining, leading 17-13 but los
ing a grip on their lead.
Rochester eventually took the 
lead with seven minutes left in the 
first half, and held it into halftime, 
when it led Carnegie Mellon 32-28.
Two minutes into the second 
half, the Tartans surged, scoring 
nine points in under three minutes, 
and taking back the lead, 42-38. 
But that only lasted a couple pos
sessions, and the Tartans never
held a lead again.
With 3:45 remaining in the 
game, junior guard Danielle 
Bennett drained a three-point field 
goal, closing Rochesters lead to 
53-51.
But they could not hold out.
Starting guard Michelle Sodini 
went 9-19 from the field, leading 
scorers with 20 points, four steals, 
five rebounds, and two assists. 
Junior guard Danielle Bennett also 
contributed big numbers, totaling 
13 points, seven assists, and three 
rebounds.
The Tartans had won their last 
game prior to the Rochester game, 
a 51-49 contest over Thiel College, 
in which poor shooting plagued 
both teams.
Carnegie Mellon shot 35 percent 
in for the whole game (but only 32 
percent in the second half), while 
Thiels 9 of 41 first half helped 
them conclude with a 27 percent 
overall mark.
The next game for the Tartans 
will be on Saturday, December 8, at 
2 pm in Skibo Gymnasium. They 
will play Grove City College (2-2), 
which defeated the Tartans early 
last season with a last minute 
three-point bucket.
Voelker records world
record in speed skating
KEARNS, Utah (AP)  
Germanys Sabine Voelker set a 
world record in the womens 1,000 
meters Sunday to win a World Cup 
race, while Jeremy Wotherspoon 
added two gold medals to his col
lection.
Voelker finished in 1 minute, 
14.06 seconds to beat the old mark 
of 1:14.13, set March 10 by team
mate Monique Garbrecht-Enfeldt 
at the Utah Olympic Oval during 
the World Single-Distance Speed 
Skating Championships.
Voelker, third in Saturdays 
1,000-meter race, covered the final 
400 meters Sunday in 29.10 sec
onds.
I wasnt sure after my finish that 
the world record was "perfectly 
mine, said Voelker, who had to 
watch Garbrecht-Enfeldt and 
American Jennifer Rodriguez, who 
won Saturdays race, skate before 
she knew her record would stand.
Rodriguez finished second in 
1:14.71, while Garbrecht-Enfeldt 
was next in 1:14.97.
Wotherspoon won the mens 500 
and 1,000 Sunday  just like he 
did on Saturday.
Those four medals gave the 
Canadian 34 for his World Cup 
career, behind only the 48 won by
Uwe-Jens May of Germany and the 
46 won by Dan Jansen of the 
United States.
I didnt know that. I havent kept 
track, Wotherspoon said. Its 
interesting, good to know.
In Sundays 500, Wotherspoon 
edged American Casey 
FitzRandolph by five-hundredths 
of a second with a time of 34.66 
seconds.
The bronze went to Canadian 
Mike Ireland (34.96).
In the 1,000, Wotherspoon won 
in 1:07.83, 0.11 slower than the 
world record he set Saturday.
Erben Wennemars of 
Netherlands was next Sunday in 
1:07.88, with Adne Sondral of 
Norway third in 1:08.15.
Canadas Catriona Doan Lemay, 
the defending Olympic champion 
in the 500, won that race for the 
second time in two days Sunday in 
a time of 37.40 seconds.
Voelker was second in 37.64, fol
lowed by Sayuri Osuga, in a 
Japanese national record of 37.78.
They were good races, but they 
can be better, said Lemay, who set 
the world record and the track 
record of 37.29 in March during 
the championships. Once I settle 
down, they can be better.

Campus HIV photography exhibit supports World AIDS Day
Shaina McGrath/Photo Co-Editor
Photo and accompanying text at HIV exhibit
by Emma Rehm
Copy Co-Manager
Saturday marked the 
opening of HIV and. 
Company, a photography 
exhibit in the Connan 
Room of the University 
Center. In conjunction 
with the World AIDS Day 
events across campus 
The exhibit by Education
al Arts consisted of 19 per
sonal interviews by Joe 
Schneider and Elizabeth 
Strain, and corresponding 
photography by Franklin 
Avery.
World AIDS Day has 
been celebrated annually 
since 1988, following a 
world conference calling 
for tolerance and aware
ness, instead of the suspi
cion and misinformation 
that so often surround the 
disease.
Outside of the room was 
a table with information 
about sexually transmit
ted diseases and another 
table of portable CD play
ers. The CDs have one 
track for each interview, 
in order of the pho
tographs.
The room itself was set 
up with a half circle of 
easels with black and 
white and color pho
tographs of people, most
ly from California, who 
are living with HIV and 
other sexually transmitted 
diseases. The photogra
phy is phenomenal; each 
picture seems to contain 
not just likenesses of peo
ple, but pieces of the peo
ple themselves.
In addition to the pho
tographs, the room had 
easels with printed 
excerpts from the inter
views, so even without lis
tening to the interviews, 
each subjects personality, 
suffering, and optimism 
was apparent.
The interviews present
ed individual histories of 
struggles with all faces of 
the disease: the physical 
and health consequences, 
the mental and emotional 
effects, and the social 
stigma associated with 
sexually transmitted dis
eases.
A common theme for 
the people who volun
teered interviews said, I 
used to think it didnt hap
pen to people like me 
was a theme common to 
nearly all of the people 
who volunteered inter
views. Seana (all partici
pants were identified with 
only a first name) made a 
particularly relevant com
ment about how dismis
sive people are of the 
risks: I never really
thought that I needed to 
take an HIV test or that I 
was at risk. The guys I had 
sex with were nice people 
and they were in college 
and those people wouldnt 
have HIV.
But the overwhelming 
atmosphere in the room is 
not one of victimization or 
despair. It is a moving 
exhibition of hope, and 
the optimism of survivors.

They say history repeats itself. 
When reading dusty text books and 
analyzing events long past, it is 
often possible to lay your index fin

hundred pages, and place your 
thumb on a similar occurance, 
thinking to yourself: My, history 
has really outdone itself this time 
and, wouldnt you know, history 
really is in the palm of my hand.
The discussion after Rebels with

Sundance award filmmaker Jackie 
Ochs presents Letters Not About Love
by Jesse Dubus
Staffwriter
Late in the experimental docu
mentary Letters Not About Love, 
the American poet Lyn Hejinian 
describes the pleasure of glancing 
through a window at night from 
outside, when the inhabitants 
inside havent yet bothered to 
close the blinds. The pleasure isnt 
a prurient one, only the fascina
tion of seeing the utter ordinari
ness of life. Its this privileged 
glimpse of the everyday, like 
observing the faces on a bus that is 
also one of the most enjoyable 
parts of Jackie Ochss film.
Ochs, a New York-based film
maker, presented the film in 
McConomy Auditorium on Friday, 
as part of a visit sponsored by the 
Adamson Visiting Writers Series 
and BHA programs. In two busy 
days, Ochs met with several 
groups of students and also pre
sented her film, that won the top 
documentary award at Austins 
South by Southwest Film Festival, 
at Pittsburgh Filmmakers
Thursday night. Previous films by 
Ochs have been honored with pre
mieres at the New York 
International Film Festival, and 
The Secret Agent won the Special 
Jury Prize from the Sundance Film 
Festival.
Letters Not About Love is based 
upon a series of correspondences 
written between 1988 and 1993 by 
two poets, Hejinian and the 
Ukrainian Arkadii Dragomoschenko. 
The only instruction given to the two 
by Ochs was a list of words; everyday 
words like home, work, vio
lence, and window, which they 
were to write to each other about, 
describing what the words meant 
to them. Around the reflections of 
the poets, read in voiceover by Lili 
Taylor and Victor Nord, Ochs con
structed images shot in both coun
tries that illustrate the words by 
making the same associative con
nections that the poets do.
While the dialogue forms an 
interesting individual account of 
the poets homelands through the 
end of the cold war to the breakup 
of the Soviet Union, the correspon
dents main focus is sharing their
ruminations on far less topical 
subjects, sifting through their 
memories to piece together reflec
tions on the way life is experi
enced and the way words are used 
to express the experience.
In this sense the film is very 
much in the tradition of Chris 
Markers brilliant Sans Soleil, 
another documentary that 
obliquely reflects on the experi
ence of life by observing and 
reflecting rather than showing 
and declaring. Sans Soleil is an apt 
comparison as well because of that 
films obsession with memory and 
culture. Letters use of a dual nar
ration expands upon Sans Soleils 
observations in a way, by provid
ing perspectives of the two poets 
countries from both an insiders 
and outsiders point of view.
Talking about home, 
Dragomoschenko evokes the 
details that comprise a memory. 
Dust on the piano, a glass of 
water on a table, drops of water on 
the wall: Its a pleasure to run my 
fingers through this dust. 
Perhaps this is the best way to
see OCHS, page B2
This film is better than sex

billed in its promotional material as 
three days in the life of a one-night 
stand, has largely been dismissed, 
at best, by the critical community, 
and slammed at worst. A. O. Scott 
of the New York Times ridiculed it, 
using it as a target for his consider
able wit, while even the PostGazette1s Barbra Vancheri joined in with 
a parochial rejection. (Fortunately 
for her, at least the film isnt subti
tled.)
The movies audience reception 
hasnt fared much better, a fact that 
is unsurprising from the poor 
notices it has received. The lack of 
publicity muscle from the distribu
tor hasnt helped either, maybe 
owing to the movies lack of star 
power, its Australian accent, or the 
abundance of nudity and sex in the 
film.
All of this is extremely regret
table considering that it is one of 
the best romantic comedies made
in any country in many years. The 
story tells of two Australians in 
their 20s named Josh (David 
Wenham) and Cin (Susie Porter) 
who meet at a party and embark 
upon a one-night stand with the 
knowledge that Josh is returning to 
London in three days.
The night extends into the next 
day and beyond though, as a purely 
physical relationship hints at 
becoming something more unex
pectedly and almost against the 
will of the young couple. I just 
want you to f*ck me and then piss 
off, Cin says in her head, and Josh 
undoubtedly goes in ready to hap
pily oblige, but as is customary in 
romantic comedies, things get com
plicated.
Critics favorite response has 
been to skewer the films vapidity, 
ridiculing the two attractive actors 
who are without neuroses, calling 
them empty-headed and uninter
esting. They may not do much 
more than have sex and talk about 
having sex throughout the movie, 
which takes place almost entirely in 
Cins apartment, but Better Than

African drum dance is the life of the party
Erica Dibenedetto/Art Editor
by Eugene Kotlarchuk
Junior Staffwriter
What is this world coming to? Is 
the life of the party the space 
between the hand and the drum or 
is the noise made by high-pitched 
percussion instruments the road
way to a peace of mind and molec
ular fortune? Well, who cares as 
long as youve got a bongo drum 
beneath the rhythm of your fin
gers?
The Student Activities African 
Drum Dance was the life of the 
party here at Carnegie Mellon 
University on November 26. 
Students kept tapping whimsical 
time-phrased rhythmical beats 
upon the leather strapped African 
instruments supplied and played by 
musical guests brought to you by 
Student Affairs. Hold onto your 
instruments because there have 
been various drum circles on and 
off campus throughout the semes
ter, including ones in the park by 
the Outing Club as well as in dorm
percussion wild fire musical dance 
marathons.
Mondays African Drum Dance 
was a spectacular performance 
by both the musical guests and 
students. The drum circle 
spanned at least an hour while 
the dance marathon lasted about 
an hour as well. Both were vigor
ously energetic, entertaining, 
and educational for student par
ticipants. The wildfire melliflu
ous rhythms could be heard 
throughout the entire University 
Center causing people to gather, 
smile, and revel at the outstand
ing performance of the guest 
musicians and musical Carnegie 
Mellon Students.
As the circle evolved into a tra
ditional African drum dance, the 
students, with much practice 
from the video game Dance 
Revolution, participated elatedly 
with revelry in the energetic beats 
of Africa.

example, the John

rhythms with its repeti
tively three note

piano adds a percussive

Australian movie: in defense of sex
AUSTRALIA, from page B1
Sex is much more than just soft 
porn. In a way, the movie almost 
seems like a feature-length exten
sion of the two leads easy flirting 
in Godards classic Breathless, 
especially in the lengthy scene set 
in the apartment of that films 
heroine. Susie Porter even bears a 
passing resemblance to Jean 
Seberg, with her shortly cropped 
blond hair.
Much has been made about the 
lack of articulateness in the dia
logue, but to criticize the absence 
of insight into sex in Josh and Cins 
comments is to miss the point of 
the film. First-time writer and 
director Jonathan Teplitzky isnt 
concerned with what they say 
about sex, but how they say it: The 
giddiness of discussing the taboo 
and especially the way they con
ceal more powerful emotion, try
ing to protect themselves by justi
fying them away under the cover 
of sex.
The real pleasure of the movie 
isnt social observation or com
ment, though; rather, its the 
impeccable poetic evocation of the 
uncontainable emotional infatua
tion with another person that 
comes at the beginning of love, 
and the joy in recognizing the 
innocuous details of lovemaking. 
Josh recites a recipe for a cake in 
his head while trying to hold off an 
orgasm in one scene. Earlier, he 
struggles to kick off the jeans stuck 
around his ankles.
Its details like these that make 
the film. Teplitzky settles on 
images like the shadow of Joshs 
hand in lovemaking seemingly 
caressing the back of a man
nequin (Cin is a dressmaker), or 
the couples bare feet as they fol
low each other across the room, 
kissing as they track their clothes, 
creating a sort of dance in the 
process.
Part of American critics adverse 
reaction to the film could be its 
sexual frankness, which many 
have seem to confuse with obscen
ity. This may seem unsurprising 
for any film that depicts cunnilingus (off-screen) within the first 
five minutes. But the openness 
with which it treats sex and nudity, 
very different from the way 
American films treat the subjects, 
is just the opposite.
The movie depicts nudity more 
often in an artful way rather than 
an erotic one. It avoids the 
hypocrisy of many American films 
that use much less nudity but use it 
solely to titillate. Gary Phillips 
drenches Cins loft apartment with 
the Australian sunlight in his 
exquisite cinematography, leaving 
golden highlights on the young 
lovers bodies.
Wenham and Porter are brilliant 
in the lead roles, sharing an easy 
chemistry that is essential to the 
movie, in which they spend so 
much time walking around with
out clothes. The two are anything 
but superficial, successfully pro
jecting growing feelings through
their eyes. Porters soft eyes and 
freckled skin are magnetic while 
Wehham conveys a surprising 
depth in his face from his eyes and 
mouth when his amusing front 
slips away.
The movie does employ several 
narrative devices that would feel 
clunky in most films: an
omnipresent cupid-like taxi driver 
and pseudo-documentary bits spo
ken by characters directly to the 
camera. But here they are enjoy
able in the way they accentuate the 
films playfulness and the way that 
it manages to marry the fairy tale 
quality of Hollywood romantic 
comedies with a sharper realism 
associated with independent films. 
This unlikely combination is cer
tainly one of the films most 
impressive achievements.
Better Than Sex is part of a 
recent crop of excellent Australian 
films that have appeared in the 
past few years. The trend has 
received very little attention 
though, possibly resulting from the 
fact that the films are neither com
mercial enough for Hollywood 
because of their lack of star power 
nor enough highbrow for serious 
film circles.
This is unfortunate because the 
films are so accessible and highquality, traits that would seem to 
lend them to potentially greater 
commercial success in the United 
States than they enjoy now. In any 
case, hopefully the trend from 
Australia will continue to flourish 
in the coming years.
Ochs reflects on life through film
OCHS, from page B1 
describe Ochss visual approach to 
the film as well. With a rough 
handheld aesthetic in the style of 
Brakhages camera-eye and home 
movies, (of which several are 
included in the film), Ochs runs 
her camera through the dust of 
memory, powerfully evoking the 
half-remembered reminiscences of 
childhood. The camera lingers on 
small details like a finger tracing 
the rim of a wine glass in an early 
meeting in the film.
Her images of faces in the former 
Soviet Union are the most indelible 
in the film. Quietly observing the 
faces of ordinary people in the street, 
Ochs succincdy describes the hard
ships of contemporary life. The lines 
in the faces of the old women 
wrapped inside scarves are as good a
record as any of the recent history of 
their country.
The faces are unforgettable, 
reflecting a suffering that seems to 
make smiling impossible. The 
weather itself seems to telegraph 
the conditions of the two countries. 
The sunniness of Hejinians 
California contrasts sharply with 
the oppressive grayness of Moscow.
When seeing films like Letters 
Not About Love, the enjoyment is 
offset by the knowledge that with 
the current distribution system in 
place, movies like it are relegated 
to the ghetto of film festivals, uni
versities, and cinematheques. In 
the mainstream system there is no 
place for anything but a film that is 
pure entertainment. A film like 
Letters, concerned with ideas, is 
uneasily marketable and so is
doomed to obscurity. It is sad 
that there is not even a small 
place for a film like it in conven
tional distribution.

Resurgence of 60s activism debatable
SDS, from page B1 
their rise and fall as a premier 
activist group of the 60s. SDS, 
which sprung from the restless 
veins of the University of Michigan 
after four black students were 
refused service at a Woolworths 
soda counter, initially focused on 
race relations.
We intended to change the 
world. Our business and our life 
was about changing the world, 
said Casey Hayden, one of the 
founding members of the organi
zation. SDS analyzed various 
cities within the country and chose 
nine of the most conflicted cities to 
start work in from the inside out 
focusing on their mission state
ment, We find violence to be 
abhorrent. In the early 1960s and 
before the conflict in Vietnam 
broke out, the group frequently 
took trips to the South, attempting 
to educate poor black communities 
and inspire them to form their own 
coalitions to improve their stan
dard of living. However, as the 
war in Vietnam heated up, 
attempts to ignore the war and 
continue their work for class and
race equality became futile, with 
SDS submitting to help fight 
against the war.
In an attempt to sum up the gen
eral reaction of sleepy young 
America after hearing about the 
war in Vietnam, Carl Oglesby said, 
It was like, What? We dont do 
that. Were supposed to be the 
good guys. We couldnt even vote 
against our own government. The 
voting age in 1960 was 21 and only 
in 1970 changed to 18. No one had 
ever heard of Vietnam.
And that preempted the ques
tion, how many modern-day 
Americans had really heard or 
knew in detail all that much about 
Afghanistan prior to September 
11? Surely Afghanistan was casu
ally mentioned as a rogue nation 
and lumped together with Libya 
and Iraq, but the country as a 
whole certainly never planned to 
invade it, to possibly bring back 
the draft for that small firecracker 
of a country.
SDS disbanded in 1969, but 
what that group of students saw 
for themselves and for the country 
still lingers on. They started with
one chapter and ended with over 
400. At their peak, SDS had over
100,000 members. Using the Bob 
Dylan lyric, You dont need to be a 
weatherman to know which way 
the wind blows as a metaphor, 
SDS prided themselves as being 
the ones to make that wind blow; 
they view Lyndon B. Johnsons 
decision to abstain from re-elec
tion as a key result of their work.
The film and discussion follow
ing no doubt led to nostalgia for 
some of the older supporters of the 
cause in the group and wonder
ment for other, newer activists. 
However, its difficult to summa
rize what exactly led to the entire 
room standing up at the nights 
conclusion, swaying, arm in arm, 
and listening to Lynd sing a song 
from his youth, with two plus two 
plus fifty make a million serving 
as part of the chorus. Perhaps the 
quote at the beginning of the film 
said by an anonymous SDS mem
ber offers the best clue:
It isnt the rebels that cause the 
troubles in the world; Its the trou
bles in the world that cause the 
rebels.
Carnegie Almanac
50 years ago, December 6, 
1961  Enthusiasm ran high as 
the 1961-62 version of the Scotch 
n Soda Board made plans for the 
clubs new show. The selection 
was, Viv, a two-act musical come
dy about a glamorous but aging 
actress who is struggling to main
tain her popularity in the movies. 
The book and lyrics were written 
by Michael Hall and Dean Brown, 
students in the Drama Department, 
and the music was composed by 
senior Pat Moore. The many fasci
nating parts for singers, dancers, 
and/or actors included 12 leading
men and women, several charac
ter actors and many chorus peo
ple; auditions were held after the 
semster break.
25 years ago, December 7,
1976  Elliot Popowitz, newly 
elected chairperson of the Student 
Senate, expressed his enthusiasm 
and optimism for its future at 
CMU. Popowitz assumed his posi
tion on November 17, along four 
new committee heads. Popowitz 
said that his main goal in office 
would be the formulation of a 
sound financial system. His con
cern stemmed from the allocation 
of club funds, which had appar
ently causd complications in previou weeks and semsters. 1976 
marked the first year when stu
dent government controlled the 
budget for all recognized organi
zations.
10 years ago, November 25, 
1991  Members of the gay com
munity and ROTC gathered at last 
Tuesdays Student Senate meeting 
to debate the controversial resolu
tion against discrimination passed 
on November 5 by Student Senate.
During the five hour Student 
Senate meeting, people were 
given a chance to voice their opin
ions and ask questions concerning 
the resolution. NROTC battalion 
commander Ken Wilson asked 
Student Senate to repeal the reso
lution and reconsider it.
5 years ago, November 25, 
1996  Student Senate voted 
unanimously last Monday night to 
impeach Senate Treasurer Brian 
Mueller. The move stemmed from 
Muellers continual absence at 
Senate meetings and a general
perception among Senators that 
he had not been fulfilling his 
responsibilities. Mueller said at 
the time that Its probably just a 
matter of miscommunication. He 
attributed his absence at Senate 
meetings to a class conflict and 
indicated that there had been little 
need for his input.
1 year ago, November 4, 2000
 CMU students always com
plained about the limited dining 
options on campus. Recent legis
lation passed by City Council 
threatened to limit dining options
for students further. The new 
ordinance would have prevented 
vendors from selling their prod
ucts from several places in the city, 
including several locations on 
streets near or on campus. The 
orinance was greatly modified 
from its original form, allowing 
many of the venddors to stay on 
campuswhile some were forced 
to relocate, the number of vendors 
subsequently increased.

3 December 2001THE TARTANPage B4GSIA lands new executive director 
for undergrad business program
by Mayank Bubna
Staffwriter
Milton Cofield is a Renaissance man  a man 
whose pastimes include listening to music and 
growing houseplants. Cofield, also a senior lec
turer in the business management program, has 
been named the new executive director of the 
Graduate School of Industrial Administrations 
bachelors of science in the business administra
tion (BSBA) program. He was chosen through a 
rigorous selection progress and after an intense 
nationwide search for a new director for the pro
gram here at Carnegie Mellon.
Cofields responsibilities as executive director 
include effectively administering the undergrad
uate business program, ensuring that the pro
gram runs smoothly in terms of course offerings 
and adding new initiatives to strengthen the BA 
program. He will be working closely with the 
undergraduate program officers and students, 
and will be involved in many of the important 
decision making processes and other issues of 
importance to the school.
Carnegie Mellon is a great University, 
remarked Cofield, and I chose it primarily 
because I like administration and administra
tive work. Its business program is undoubtedly 
one of the best in the country and it has a great 
variety of different educational programs to 
offer. I am looking forward to playing a leader
ship role in helping students out, and maintain
ing and enhancing the high position we already 
have.
Cofield has been actively working with stu
dents for a number of years. Before joining 
Carnegie Mellon University, he was a professor 
at Rochester Institute of Technology for 22 years. 
He was quite involved in community activities in 
New York, which he hopes to play up here in 
CMU, too. He is highly interested in health care 
and leadership, and in fact, has even served as 
the President of directors in Westside Health 
Services, Inc., in New York from 1991 to 2001. 
He was also a member of the executive commit
tee in the Visiting Nurse Service of Rochester 
from 1992 to 1999.
Cofield is an avid traveler as well. He was a 
Fulbright Senior Scholar for the year 2000, 
which led him to the Graduate Institute of 
Technology and Innovation Management at the 
National Chengchi University in Taiwan last 
year. Furthermore, he has served as Fulbright 
American Studies Professor at De La Salle 
University in the Phillipines in May of 2000.

engage in research in foreign lands. Cofield is 
also interested in the imaging industry of 
China.
His teaching interests include imaging and 
graphic communications services marketing and 
technology management in entrepreneurial 
firms. Furthermore, he enjoys the management 
of research and development. Some of his recent 
publications and papers include From the 
Classroom to the Market: Imaging Technology 
Management and Entrepreneurship, a presen
tation at the International Society of Optical 
Engineering Northeast Regional Meeting on 
Optoelectronics, Photonics & Imaging, 
Rochester, NY, in April 2001 and Teaching 
Technology, Innovation, and Entrepreneurship 
in Science Based Curricula, at the National 
Collegiate Innovators and Inventors Alliance, 
Washington, DC, in March 2001.
Cofield is also rather positive about the devel
opment of the undergraduate business program 
in the near future. We are looking forward to a 
strategic planning activity that will commence 
on December 20, said Cofield, in anticipation of 
the future, We have a very good program, very 
highly recognized. I shall be exploring new 
opportunities that will be more beneficial to the 
students.
Cofield earned his bachelors degree from 
Southern University, a masters in business 
administration (MBA) in finance from the 
Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, and 
his PhD from the University of Illinois.
Renowned CMU program in computational 
finance now available to undergraduates
by Gautam Jain
Staffwriter
If you are interested in learning 
about the structure of financial mar
kets or using mathematical models to 
predict the future trends in business, 
then computational finance is the right 
major for you. In the spring of 2001, 
the Mellon College of Science and the 
Heinz School of Public Policy and 
Management began offering a bache
lors of science in computational 
finance to further meet the needs of the 
finance and the information technolo
gy sector.
Designed after the highly popular 
graduate program in computational 
finance, this degree helps students to 
achieve a broad-based education in the 
fields of mathematics, probability, sta
tistics, and the applications of these 
disciplines to finance. Students gradu
ating with this degree could enter 
industries related to finance and 
applied mathematics, or could pursue 
further education in economics, busi
ness, and mathematical sciences.
A committee comprised of distin
guished faculty from the Graduate 
School of Industrial Administration, 
Heinz, and Mellon College of Sciences 
Department of Mathematical Sciences 
oversees this program. Students gener
ally apply to this program in the second 
semester of their first year although 
later application is also possible. As 
with most of the other programs at 
CMU, admission is highly selective.
As mentioned by Professor Steven 
Shreve, who is the designer of this 
program, Admission is based on the 
committees judgment about four 
things: (1) The ability of the applicant 
to handle serious mathematics (2) The 
communication and interpersonal 
skills of the applicant, and whether 
they indicate the ability to flourish in a 
business environment (3) The level of 
maturity of the applicant (4) The clari
ty of the applicant about career goals.
Related to (3) is the fact that stu
dents in the bachelors program will in 
their senior year take graduate courses 
in the Heinz School and in the masters 
program in computational finance.
Carnegie Mellon began offering the
interdisciplinary professional degree of 
MS in computational finance in 1994 
because of the faculty in the 
Departments of Statistics, 
Mathematics, and in GSIA who con
duct intensive research on quantitative 
methods in finance. That program cur
rently attracts 29 students in 
Pittsburgh and over 150 students 
worldwide. Professor Shreve says, A 
greater number of recruiters from 
investment banks and other financial 
sectors have been attracted to our cam
pus thanks to the success of the mas
ters program, and they have expressed 
keen desire to hire new bachelors 
degree recipients. In fact, some 
recruiters have interviewed students in 
CIT and MCS, as well as students in the 
business administration program. It 
has become apparent that there is a 
demand for students who have an
interdisciplinary background which 
combines serious mathematics and sta
tistics with knowledge of financial mar
kets and how mathematical models are 
used in these markets.
Carnegie Mellon University was the 
first to introduce the masters program, 
in computational finance. And since 
then, many leading institutions includ
ing Columbia University, New York 
University, the University of Chicago, 
Oxford, and Cambridge have followed 
suit. Despite the existence of these 
other programs, Wall Street and the 
academic community alike regard 
CMUs as the best. In Professor Shreves 
words, With the creation of the inter
disciplinary bachelors program in 
computational finance, Carnegie 
Mellon is building on its overwhelming 
success with the masters program to 
once again lead the way.

Inventor to unveil long-awaited mystery invention on Good Morning America
by Chirag Nangia

been waiting anxiously for details 
on Ginger, also known as IT, an 
invention from famed Dean 
Kamen, because of the life-chang

have. Finally, the Monday, details 
on the invention are expected to be 
revealed on the Good Morning
America television show on ABC 
with anchor Diane Sawyer.
Kamen has filed for at least four 
patents in the past three months, 
all of which revolve around a per
sonal mobility vehicle that could 
carry people up stairs or other 
irregular surfaces. Kamen, a win
ner of the 2000 National Medal for 
Technology, is the creator of the 
project, backed by his New 
Hampshire-based company, DEKA 
Research and Development.
A patent filed, earlier with the 
World Intellectual Property 
Organization (WIPO) has fueled 
speculation for nearly a year that 
Ginger is a motorized, scooter-like 
device. Kamen has provided some 
details on the device, in that it will 
nave a price tag of less than $2000, 
and will take less than 10 minutes 
to assemble. It is due to be released 
in 2002.
Apple Computer CEO Steve Jobs 
and Amazon.com CEO Jeff Bezos
have seen the device, with Jobs 
going so far as to say it could 
prompt builders to construct cities 
around it, giving a much-needed 
boost to the rumors that this will 
be a incredibly significant inven
tion. Kamen himself has refused 
to provide many details, and 
instead of declaring it to be 
ground-breaking, rather simply 
put, We have a promising pro
ject, but nothing of the earthshattering nature that people are
conjuring up.
Theories about the device are 
widespread. Some believe that it 
might just be a modified scooter 
with an engine, while the more 
daring rumors suggest the device 
will have the ability to float and 
move in air. In fact, recently a 
Kamen-related company registered 
the domain flywheels.com, suggest
ing that the latter rumor may have 
some merit.
Technically, the device is
rumored to use the extremely heatefficient Stirling engine, and one of 
the recent patents seeks protection 
for a method for controlling the 
fuel-air ratio of a burner of an 
external combustion engine.
DEKA currently focuses largely 
on medical-based tools, but Ginger 
is believed to sell outside this mar
ket, to the general public. The wait 
for this announce has be an anx
ious one, fueled by rumors and 
speculation.

US airlines to extend fare discounts
CHICAGO (AP)  The 
biggest US airlines have extend
ed the deadline on business-fare 
discounts well into 2002, seek
ing to revive slumping sales 
among their highest-paying 
passengers.
The move was announced 
Friday by United Airlines for 
two of its discount offers and 
quickly matched by its main 
competitors. American,
Continental and Delta followed 
suit, just as they did when 
United originally introduced the 
discounts on October 1. 
Northwest already has a similar 
plan.
United said it was pushing 
back the travel deadline to 
March 31 from December 31 on 
two lower-fare options. One 
offers 50 percent off the current 
unrestricted business fare with 
a 21-day advance purchase and 
a oneor two-night minimum 
stay; the other would give 25 
percent off with a 10-day 
advance purchase.
Neither requires a Saturdaynight stay  a stipulation many
carriers have eased in an effort 
to win back business travelers.
These Back to Business 
fares have been well received by 
our customers, said Patricia 
Mash, vice president of revenue 
management for United.
Overall, however, air traffic 
has not been recovering as fast 
as airlines had hoped after the 
September 11 terrorist attacks. 
American and United, the Nos. 
1 and 2 carriers, have each been 
losing $15 million a day, in large 
part because of a steep falloff in 
high-end business fares that 
account for 48 percent of its rev
enue.
United, the second-biggest US 
airline, offers about 1,650 
flights a day  scaled back from 
about 2,400 before the attacks.
The discount deals are similar 
to existing, regular offerings 
from Northwest Airlines, 
although Northwest spokesman 
Kurt Ebenhoch said the 
Minneapolis-based carrier 
would match Uniteds offer in 
any market where its BizFlex 
fares dont exist.

Business Briefs
US economy 
shrinks 1.1%
The US economy, battered by 
the terrorist attacks, turned in its 
worst performance in a decade 
during the third quarter, shrinking 
at a rate of 1.1 percent. Many 
economists expect an even steeper 
drop in the current quarter but are 
hopeful for a turnaround next 
year.
The revised reading on gross 
domestic product released by the 
Commerce Department Friday 
showed the economy was much 
weaker in the July-September 
quarter than the 0.4 percent rate 
of decline estimated a month ago.
The 1.1% drop in GDP  the 
total output of goods and services 
in the United States  followed a 
barely discernible growth rate of 
0.3% in the second quarter and 
illustrated just how quickly and 
dramatically the economy sank 
after the deadliest attack in US 
history.
Many economists believe the 
economy is sinking deeper in the 
current quarter, forecasting eco
nomic output will fall at a rate of 
at least 1 5%.
Some economists believe the 
GDP will move back up into posi
tive territory in the first quarter of 
2002, though growth is expected 
to be fairly anemic.
Economists hope that the 
Federal Reserves aggressive inter
est rate cuts  along with addi
tional tax cuts and increased 
spending being contemplated by 
Congress  will lead to a solid 
recovery by the second half of next 
year.
To prevent the economy from 
sinking deeper into a recession, 
the Fed has cut interest rates 10 
times this year. Many economists 
predict another reduction
December 11.
The third quarters 1.1% rate of 
decline was the weakest GDP per
formance since the first quarter of 
1991, the depths of the previous 
recession.Excite begins 
service cutoff
On Friday, a judge cleared the 
way for the bankrupt
Excite @Home high-speed Internet 
network, with more than 4 million 
subscribers, to turn off its high
speed network. Bankruptcy Judge 
Thomas Carlson said the company, 
based in Redwood City, could can
cel existing contracts with cable 
companies.
Excite@Home subsequently 
cut service to 850,000 AT&T 
Broadband customers early 
Saturday, but said subscribers to 
other cable companies were not 
immediately affected. AT&T said 
it had started transferring its cus
tomers to its own network, a 
process that could take up to 10 
days for some subscribers. About
86,000 customers in the 
Northwest were transferred to 
AT&Ts own network on 
Saturday, and the company 
planned to move the remainder, 
in Chicago, Pittsburgh, Hartford, 
and cities in the West, over two to 
10 days.
The ruling affected many of the 
nations largest cable companies, 
including AT&T, Cox and Rogers, 
that sold Internet access through 
Excite@Homes network.
In its statement, Excite@Home  
said it was still negotiating contin
ued service with its other cable 
company customers, but ended 
service to AT&T after determin
ing that it would not be able to 
reach agreement....
The judge gave Excite@Home 
the leeway to end the contracts 
after concluding they had become 
clearly burdensome to the com
pany. Excite@Home executives 
said they were costing the compa
ny up to $6 million per week. The 
companies said they plan to 
appeal.
Excite@Homes bondholders 
have accused AT&T of using its 
controlling position on 
Excite@Homes board to steer the 
company into bankruptcy as part 
of a scheme to buy the company, 
owner of one of the nations 
biggest high-speed Internet net
works, at a bargain price. AT&T 
has denied the allegations.

Harry Potter: 
Worth the 
hype? This 
Muggle critic 
says yes!
by Kristin Lala
Copy Co-Manager
Who would have thought that a 
bespectacled boy with a crooked 
scar and a penchant for wizardry 
would be so popular? Well, Warner 
Bros., for one, which released the 
wildly successful flick earlier last 
month and allegedly plans to make 
one more per year until all of 
author J. K. Rowlings masterpieces 
have been brought to the big 
screen. In its first 10 days in the 
theaters, Harry Potter and the 
Sorcerers Stone managed to bring 
in a whopping $188.1 million, 
which ought to buy a hell of a lot of 
Bertie Botts for young star Daniel 
Radcliffe and co.
Described by E! Online as filled 
with wonderful, vibrant sets, cap
tivating new worlds and, yes, 
nearly everything from its pages, 
Harry Potter and the Sorcerers 
Stone left this reviewer wowed by 
special effects and a stellar cast. 
Although the role of Potter 
(played by Radcliffe) was ulti
mately reduced to a lot of sur
prised blinking and awed whispers 
about his power, companions Ron 
Weasley (Rupert Grint) and 
Hermione Granger (Emma 
Watson) rounded out the magical 
trio perfectly. Complemented by 
the enchanted backdrop of the 
Hogwarts School of Witchcraft 
and Wizardry, director Chris 
Columbus managed to capture the 
atmosphere of Rowlings novel 
quite well, with aptly cast 
Headmaster Dumbledore and 
Professors McGonagall, Quirrell, 
and Snape. And while Robbie 
Coltrane, who plays the lumbering 
half-giant Hagrid deserves a 
hearty round of applause, my per
sonal favorite members of the cast 
have to be the Dursleys, Harrys 
surrogate family who cares for

Best/worst albums by 
senior citizens to rich kids
by Ryan Hamilton
Staffwriter
The current year, which started 
in January and will end in another 
few weeks, is the 2001st since the 
death of your friend and mine, 
Jesus Christ. It would be appreciat
ed if someone could make this fact 
aware to the likes of Nickelback 
and 3 Doors Down, whose unlistenable guitar sludge and high 
school poetry lyrics are making a 
strong case for 1994.
Anyway. Best and Worst things 
of this year: Music-wise
Best Album by a Senior 
Citizen: Bob Dylan, Love and 
Theft.
Dylan turned 60 this year, but it 
hasnt kept him from putting out
the most accomplished and most 
enjoyable rock album of the year. 
Hes been knocking back affecting, 
bittersweet torch-burners like 
Mississippi for decades, but the 
sly grin and stomping feet of 
Summer Days are an extremely 
pleasant surprise. Following the 
mournful, apocalyptic traditional 
ballads of Time Out of Mind and 
the Grammy-winning, beyonddescription Things Have 
Changed, Love and Theft seems to 
signify a full-fledged revival of 
Dylans career, after most people 
had put his best years two decades 
gone.
Also, it got five stars in Rolling 
Stone, the first album since 
R.E.M.s Automatic for the People to 
do so. But who listens to industry 
rags?

Go down fighting, come 
up smiling with Mr. Roboto
by Emma Rehm
Copy Co-Manager
Do it yourself. This is not said in 
a six-year-olds bratty whine, but in 
the very sincere voice of a 20- 
something punk or hardcore kid 
telling it like it is.
The DIY scene is, in part, a reac
tion to the glossy, expensive, over
produced, and formulaic nature of 
pop culture. Books, magazines, 
venues, bands, songs - theyre all 
available for a certain predeter
mined amount of money, from a 
large corporation via the Internet. 
One response to this corporate 
whore-dom is based on the idea 
that if you want something to be 
done well, youve got to do it your
self.
And Pittsburgh, however else it
may be lacking, has a solid DIY 
scene, based at the Mr. Roboto 
Project, on Wood Street in 
Wilkinsburg. A product of this 
scene is a compilation cd entitled 
Go Down Fighting, Come Up 
Smiling. The disc is accompanied 
by a nice, fat, xeroxed book, and 
together, the comp and book are 
very energetic and personal. 
Theres something really satisfying 
about having something that was 
made by people instead of comput
ers.
Which is not, of course, to dis
count the role of computers; the 
bands submitted recordings of 
their chosen songs on CD-R. The 
29 tracks were chosen by the bands 
themselves, and collected by Mike 
Q. Roth, better known simply as Q, 
and Justin Cummings. The CD-Rs

Reviewer offers opinions on top 15 metal albums
by Albert Cohen
Staff Writer
Well, its that time again. A time where we all 
reflect on what weve been given, and what we 
think next year will bring. Of course, with the 
events of the past few months, it may seem that 
nothing is quite certain anymore. But, if we take 
a step back and look at the sheer willpower of 
the American people, we see that indeed there is 
a lot to be thankful for. Carrying on with that 
sentiment, the e-music industry has had a very 
good year before and after, and it is this small 
diversionary pleasure that I salute here. So, 
without further ado, I salute the following for 
their contributions to music lovers everywhere. 
Speaking of whom, I would like to dedicate this 
list to two people I am proud to call friends, and 
much more ardent music fans than I: Sudeep 
Balasubramanian and Mike Livan.
The Top 15 Albums of 2001
#15: Alcohol Fuelled Brewtality, Black Label 
Society
After striking out on his own, Ozzy Osbourne 
guitarist Zakk Wylde has produced two albums 
that will stand as some of the finest Southern 
metal this side of Pantera and Down. The live 
album he put out this year is a treat, sampling 
favorites from both of these as well as including 
for us die-hard fans an extra disc with acoustic 
versions of Snowblind, Heart of Gold, and 
others. An excellent addition to your collection.
#14 Chinese Democracy, Guns n Roses 
Okay, so it still hasnt come out yet. But, from 
what I heard at Axls comeback show at Rock in
Rio III earlier this year, rock and roll has a kick 
in the ass coming. They may not have Slash (or 
anyone else from their glory days) but the songs 
I heard had passion and sincerity that blows 
away everything I hear on the radio today.
#13 True Carnage, Six Feet Under 
It may not be as ground-breaking as 99s 
Maximum Violence or 00s cover album delight 
Graveyard Classics, but this is a solid effort 
from the guys who put a groove in death metal. 
Extra props go to them for bringing along Lamb 
of God on tour this year with them.
#12 Pass out of Existence, Chimaira 
Very rarely do I find a band that puts out 
music that is both violent and beautiful. Whats 
more surprising is that theyre this technically 
sound so early in their career.
#11 Inscribe, Scar Culture 
A monster debut from a band that will take 
its place alongside the giants of this genre. 
Once again, Century Media has shown that 
they are the leading label in finding new talent

The Princess and the Warrior 
Thursday, December 6
I much prefer the princess and the pea. After all, a simple pea 
is more formidable than a warrior. A warrior is only good for 
protection and destruction; a pea is good for all things. A pea 
is nutritious. Peas make a chicken pot pie complete. I cannot 
imagine the disappointment one would face when opening a 
chicken pot pie and only seeing meat potatoes and gravy. The 
horror! Only gray, no green. Warriors wont even eat chicken 
pot pies; its not good enough for them. Ive heard they like 
Swedish Fish between crackers. Yeah, like thats manly food.
A dried pea is more effective than a warriors sword. The 
stealth you can achieve with dried peas as a weapon is vastly 
superior to that which you an attain with a sword. Pea shooters, 
the instrument of common second grade pranksters, can be 
concealed in anything. You can hide in a tree, and wait until 
your sister walks by, then nail her in the head with a dried pea. 
They hurt! If its hard enough, you might even be able to take 
an eye out! Its even possible to defeat an entire army of war
riors with pea shooters.

Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back 
Friday, December 7
The moral of this story is, dont rip off comic strips without 
giving due homage to those whom the strip is about. Well, not 
unless you want a foul-mouthed stoner and a fat silent dude to 
sabotage your effort. This movie, the latest in Kevin Smiths 
films, features the two most colorful characters in his previous 
works. Look for cameo appearances, though, from almost 
everyone you can think of. On a serious note, large crowds can 
be anticipated for this one, so get your ticket from AB early.
Why the name Silent Bob? Why not use Mute Mike, or Quiet 
John? Philosophical Phil might be appropriate as well. Silent 
Bob is short, yet dignified. The name is silent in itself. Its short 
and doesnt take a lot of effort to annunciate. The alliterified 
Mute Mike is too glottal, as is the Q in Quiet John. Silent Bob 
makes a statement, about the simple quietness of the character. 
Philosophical Phil is just too long to say. By whatever name, 
hes a perfect compliment to Jay, a loud and obnoxious burn 
out. Thats a paradox though, all of the burn-outs I know are 
rather quiet and laid-back.

One day I was eating cereal. Lucky Charms, of course; theres 
no other cereal worth mentioning. I put my spoon into the 
bowl, and the moon talked to me.
Hello Mr. McFlick.
Hi, moon.
Youre not going to eat me, are you?
Yeah, I was planning on it. You look extra tasty today. 
Well, I thought I should warn you, my blue dye is poison. 
Itll cause tides in your stomach, and youll eventually die.
Oh will I?
Yes, Ive caused death in eight out of 10 lab rats.
Isnt that good to know.
I ate the moon. He was very tasty, and I didnt die.

Dirty Work 
Sunday, December 9
Dirty people are often humorous. Seeing someone come to 
class with dirt on their jeans or their face is funny. Dirty people 
have hilarious stories to tell. Once, I was told by a dirty person 
that he had been climbing a tree without the use of his legs. Of 
course he fell into the mud below. Some people are just natural
ly dirty. They have the dirty look about them, the dirty fashion 
sense, and the dirty smell. Dirty can be attractive, if youre dirty 
in the right way. Perhaps unkempt and disheveled is a better 
word. Interestlingly enough, dirty people are often wonderfully 
kind, unwilling to do any kind of dirty work.
Here at CMU we should have a dirty day. Guys shouldnt 
shave, and girls shouldnt comb their hair. The student body 
could roll in the mud on the Cut before their first class. 
Professors would be encouraged to do the same. How fun it 
would be! We could make mud pies, and have mud fights, and 
build gigantic mud forts. You can sabotage that annoying kid in 
your class that has rancid BO. Afterwards, wed all get out and 
go to class where wed do our work, dirty. Wed do dirty work.

B6THE TARTAN  DECEMBER 3, 2001
Reviewer takes a look at 
the best music of 2001Harry Potter bewitches, enchants moviegoer
MUSIC, from page B5 
Best IDM Album: The
Avalanches, Since I Left You 
This was actually released in 
their native Australia in 2000, 
but dont get angry with me. Its a 
warm, inviting album, much 
more so than most releases with
out vocals, and surprisingly 
cohesive for a project which sam
ples over 900 others. Its also 
quite a lot of fun, and a great 
introduction if youre new to 
dance music (I promise). You 
owe it to yourself to at least 
check out the title track.
Best Disappointment: The
Dismemberment Plan, Change
Although quite a fall-off from 
\ 1999s Killer Emergency and I,
Change still starts and ends with 
two of the most compulsively listenable tracks of the 
year. (Sentimental Man and 
Ellen and Ben). The hooks are 
not as strong, and they may have 
inadvertantly taken a page from 
the Ben Folds school of songwriting, but its still a solid album, 
and will no doubt make its share 
of top 10 lists, deserving or not.
Best Album by Privileged 
Rich Kids Whom No One 
Really Likes: The Strokes, Is 
This It?
For the most part, reviews of 
this album have been written by 
members of the Julian 
Casablancas Oral Sex Club, and 
Hey, look at me, I know who 
Television and Wire are! anony
mous. Which is unfortunate, 
since its an exciting, energetic 
rock album with far fewer pre
tensions than are being assigned 
to it. Not the saviors of Rock, and 
not the second coming of the 
Velvet Underground, the bands 
debut album is still worth check
ing out.
Worst Long-Awaited 
Follow-up by a Band Who is 
Probably, in Retrospect, 
Washed Up: A tie, Weezer,. 
Weezer, and They Might Be 
Giants, Mink Car.
Rivers Cuomo seems to have 
forgotten how to write a pop 
song, and the Johns couldnt 
have been bothered: Fourteen of 
17 tracks on Mink Car have been 
widely available to fans for quite 
a while. To be fair to Weezer, 
Island in the Sun is really excel
lent (especially when the pup
pies in the video are taken into 
account). But if Rivers disses 
Pinkerton in the press one more 
time, Im going to personally hit 
him.
Best Album to go 
Platinum: Jay-Z, The Blueprint
Two killer singles so far, an 
amazing lack of filler for a commercial hip-hop album, and a 
killer Nas dis makes Jay-Z the 
king of bubble gum rap.
Best Rock Single: Sum-41, 
Fat Lip
A bewildering barrage of Blink182, early Beastie Boys, and Van 
Halen, they may have the worlds 
worst and most inexplicable 
name (unless its the average of 
their IQs), but with this track 
they best out their dumb-punk 
contemporaries, and are miles 
ahead of Linkin Park.
Best Teen Pop Single:
N*SYNC, Pop
When Justin Timberlake 
demands that you move past the 
ice around his neck, you may 
well be witnessing the greatest 
thing of all time.
Single of the Year, Period:
Jay-Z, Girls, Girls, Girls
If you move past the misogyny, 
the racism, and the tired topic of 
conversation, and into the 
inescapable chorus and breath
taking beat, this is the most fun 
to be had watching MTV afterhours.
Worst Logic of the Year:
The labels.
According to the industry, 
record sales are down six percent 
this year (the first time theyve 
dropped in seven years). This 
seems pretty understandable, as 
the whole country has been in a 
recession since May, and record 
sales cant always go up, you 
know? There are only so many 
records to buy. The suits, howev
er, have a different justification: 
piracy. Recording Industry 
Association of America, welcome 
to my hard drive.
Album of the Year: Rufus 
Wainright, Poses
Hes got industry connections 
(his folk legend father), devastat
ing good luck, and was born into 
a major label contract; unlike 
The Strokes, however, no one 
hates him. And its really under
standable: his operatic voice, 
lucious chamber pop, and barely 
discernable folk roots have made 
for two delicious albums. Even 
better than his debut, Poses finds 
Wainright working with several 
others (including his sister) on 
tracks with influences spreading 
from Tin-Pan Alley (the killer 
Cigarettes and Chocolate Milk) 
to his own father (an equally 
affecting cover of his fathers 
One Man Guy). The other 
standout track, Tower of 
Learning, must be heard to be 
believed, but the album is a tour 
de force in the truest sense, and 
there arent any weak spots to 
speak of.
POTTER, from page B5 
him after his parents were killed 
by the evil You-Know-Who. Unlike 
Harrys wizard parents, the 
Dursleys are Muggles (humans), 
who are a bit intimidated by the 
boys spell-casting potential, and 
rightfully so, since he is inadver
tently responsible for giving his 
cousin Dudley a pig tail, one of the 
funniest scenes of the movie.
My Harry Potter experience went 
surprisingly well, considering that I 
saw it over Thanksgiving weekend 
with 10 members of my family who 
all hoped to sit together and had to 
battle baby boomers and toddlers 
alike for prime viewing space in 
one of the three theaters that were 
showing it. So much for giving 
thanks  these people were mani
acs! In the rush to get to a seat  
apparently being 25 minutes early 
was not sufficient  I managed to 
drop my snacking contraband, a 
Ziploc of cranberry muffins that I 
decidedly didnt get enough of on 
Turkey Day (The presumably
squashed treats were never recov
ered). So, this hunger of mine may 
be one reason why I empathized 
with the pudgy Dursley family. 
Regardless of this, however, chaot
ic life in their house on 4 Privet 
Drive was the perfect comic open
ing to this two-and-a-half hour film 
which was so chock-full of special 
effects that it was almost over
whelming.
Concerning special effects, 
almost everyone I spoke to was 
especially fond of the dizzyingly 
fast-paced Quidditch game, which 
I found a bit confusing to read 
about, so seeing a match in action 
definitely helped. Still, after wit
nessing over two hours of broom
stick Olympics, invisibility cloaks, 
and spontaneously rearranging 
staircases, the movies culmina
tion  Harrys confrontation with 
wicked Voldemort (the YouKnow-Who I alluded to earlier)  
was a bit anticlimactic. 
Nonetheless, this shouldnt deter 
moviegoers, as virtually every
scene was pertinent to the films 
progression; if anything, back
ground explanation is kept to a 
minimum, so its probably best to 
read the book before you go.
Finally, for those of you whod 
like to check out Harry Potter and 
his friends online, the movies Web 
site (http://harrypotter.warnerbros.com/) is full of entertain
ment, including your chance to be 
sorted by the infamous talking 
hat into one of Hogwarts four 
houses: Gryffindor (where Harry, 
Ron, and Hermione live), 
Ravenclaw (where I was placed 
based on my answers to the hat), 
Slytherin (where Harrys nemesis 
Dracoy Malfoy lives), or 
Hufflepuff (where nobody even 
remotely happenin lives).

of a baby-sitting expedition, or

were a wizard yourself  I for one

table movie experience.
FINAL GRADE: A -
The article that wasnt there looks at The Man who Wasnt There
by Sam Lewis
Junior Staffwriter
I am a college student.
I go to the University of Pittsburgh, studying 
film as my major. I wander from class to class 
with a pocket full of ten-cent words and with the 
other full of my broken pride. I wonder if those 
around me feel the same way I do. Have they 
deceived themselves to the point that this rou
tine has taken on the same feel of the halls of 
their high schools and the office buildings that 
will follow? I am not disappointed in them. 
Everything is too inward and I am, therefore, 
left with a familiar sensation. It is a mark of my 
egocentricity and, in turn, leads me to question 
even more so: Why arent they disappointed in 
me?
Courtesty of USA Films
I sometimes exaggerate the circumstances in 
our collective worlds and everything seems dra
matic, so much more acceptable. I want to make 
films because I see scenes from my life unfold 
before me. Doing such creates an excuse for the 
cyclical process that ensues. My depression is 
my inspiration...
Who am I kidding? That is the easy way out 
and thinking in such a way is only going to bring 
back the old, familiar sensation. I want what is 
more tangible and not merely a means to lie to 
myself. But I cannot be too creative or deter
mined because I might end up satisfying my 
need for some semblance of self-worth. Instead
of living the movie, I go to watch and the pre
cious cycle is unscathed.
The Man Who Wasnt There: a send back to the 
days of film noir, a genre of film that focuses 
upon a crime, the eventual downfall of the aver
age Joe who is down on his luck. That of which 
is just a symptom of the decay of his societys 
morals. Billy Bob Thornton stars as Ed Crane, a 
man who spends most of his time chain-smoking 
in his brother-in-laws barbershop. Thorntons 
sad eyes and expressionless face encapsulate 
everything that is Crane, a man who is trapped 
in an anonymous existence. He is the barber. 
He is no one.
Ed is married to Doris (Frances McDormand), 
who is in charge of the financial affairs of the 
Nirdlingers Department Store in town. She is 
subsequently having an affair with her boss, Big 
Dave (James Gandolfini). It is an affair of which 
Ed is aware and one to which he basically 
responds with a drag off his cigarette and the 
same empty stare.
Such as is with a film noir, the plot takes sev
eral twists, misfortunate turns in whichtwo peo
ple die because of the unexpected actions of two 
other individuals. Eds wife is accused of mur
der and the film is propelled in its ultimate 
direction. It is film noir, with all the compo
nents it demands: the alienated and often-cynical anti-hero, the unexpected reversals, and per
haps even a femme fatale. The black-and white 
photography is luxurious, beautifully capturing 
every shadow in each frame. I would say that 
this visual element takes the appeal of its prede
cessors and reinvents itself through its precision, 
but the truth is that I do not believe that I have 
ever seen a noir not in color. What do I know? 
I am just the critic.
The noir is what it communicates, the 
impression of the mood. It is not even for this 
that I so enjoyed the film. I have not appreciat
ed a Coen brothers film as much as this work 
since Fargo or perhaps Barton Fink, but it is for 
everything that The Man Who Wasnt There 
isnt. When Ed mortgages both the barbershop 
and his house for two separate trials within the 
film, he is able to hire Freddy Riedenshneider 
(Tony Shalhoub), who uses Heisenbergs 
uncertainty principle as his main defense. At

one point during the proceedings, he delivers 
his summation imploring the jury to look not 
at the facts, but at the meaning of the facts. 
Then he [says] the facts [have] no meaning. 
He wants them to look closer at his client in 
order to realize that when one looks closer, it 
does not make sense as to why Ed Crane would 
or how he could murder anyone. He is just the 
barber, someone who wanted more. He is 
modern man.
When I see Ed Crane, I see a man consumed 
by hair, just as he says on several occasions in 
the picture. He is incessantly perplexed by how 
hair continually grows back. It just keeps on 
coming at him, just like time persistently push
es our lives forward. He is modern man, but 
only in the sense that modern man is an enig
ma. He is the man who was not there, not 
because those around him fail to recognize 
him, but because he does not exist outside of 
that which he does within the film. He is a bar
ber. He is no one.
And so when I see this film, I leave the theater 
with a different understanding of what I am. I 
watch the people pass me on the street and I 
understand that they are no longer looking. The 
familiar sensation disappears, not because I can
not control the circumstances from which it 
emerges, but because I realize that this disap
pointment does not matter. My shoulders relax 
and I take the longest drags off my cigarette ever 
imaginable.
Perhaps I am reading much more into a film 
that is meant merely to entertain. But who 
cares? I am just a writer.

and bringing it forth to unsuspecting fans.
Be afraid of this album.
they let us into their sickest and darkest 
thoughts. Well done.
#8 Uncivilization, Biohazard 
And I thought their last album, New 
World Disorder, would stand as their latest 
and greatest. I was wrong. Evan Seinfeld 
and co. have recruited some all-stars for 
this album, including Phil Anselmo 
(Pantera), Igor Cavalera (Sepultura), and 
Jamie Jasta (Hatebreed) and it works. The 
guest appearances complement the album 
insted of stealing attention from it, and its 
already a hell of a heavy album to begin 
with. A must buy for fans of 
hardcore/metal.
And now the Top Ten ... :
#10 From Bliss to Devastation, Vision of 
Disorder
Their major label debut is no less heavy 
or melodic than any of their previous work 
(including Imprint). They are the masters 
of light/shade and have a large toolbox of 
riffs. Standouts include Brendon Cohens 
drumming, Tim Williamss expanded vocal 
range, Southbound and Living to Die.
#9 Iowa, Slipknot
With this album, Slipknot proved that 
you can sell death metal to the main
stream. Early nay-sayers who felt that they 
would be a passing fad with their jump
suits and loyal fans are now flipping burg
ers somewhere. However, it wasnt just the 
obvious nod to bands like Nile and Morbid 
Angel that impressed me. Rather, it is their 
ability to take disparate sounds and form 
them into a sonic landscape twisted 
around the blastbeat drumming and evil 
guitars. In producing this soundscape,
#7 The World Needs a Hero, Megadeth 
For most bands, losing your star gui
tarist would be the beginning of the end. 
Not for Megadeth. Coming off a surpris
ingly average album with Risk (had its 
moments, though), any change would be 
good. So, Dave Mustaine picked up 
where he left off with Youthanasia and 
put out a classic album. A return to his 
roots, Hero rewards patient fans that 
have seen their band experiment with all
types of sounds to penetrate the main
stream market. Just goes to show that 
talented bands, acutally top tier bands 
like this one, always find their way back 
to what makes them so great to begin 
with.
#6 Determination, God Forbid 
What more can I say about this band? 
Their live show is a blistering 40 minutes 
(or more) of the future of metal. They 
meld hardcore with Swedish death metal 
(ala At The Gates) with a nod to 80s metal 
riffing. And this is just the beginning. Keep 
your eye on them, cause I will.
#5 Day of Reckoning, Diecast 
Another band that takes metal-core to 
new heights. I jumped when I first heard 
this one. Literally. Awesome intro, singalong choruses and technically precise 
guitar work. The future looks bright 
indeed.
#4 Nation, Sepultura 
Okay, so losing your star guitar player 
is bad. How about losing your charismat
ic lead singer who also happens to be the 
brother of the drummer? Yeah. So,.in 98 
when they came out with a new album 
with a new singer (right after Brazil lost 
the World Cup, too!), these boys from 
Belo Horizonte couldnt be blamed for 
putting out an album that lacked some 
continuity. What a difference an album 
makes. I dont think fans or silly critics (I 
fall into both categories) realize how 
deep and intense this album really is. It 
takes many listens to realize the genius 
behind this one. The spoken word parts 
by Jello Biafra, the cameos by Jasta, they 
all fit into a larger purpose. Buy this one, 
and count yourself lucky when you see 
them on tour.
#3 Horror Show, Iced Earth 
Ive always been aware of this band, I 
own some of their albums, but I never 
really gave them the attention they 
deserve. Until now. Based on the most 
popular, and not so popular, monsters in 
literature, Jon Schaeffer and co. have put 
forth a masterpiece. In some sense, I 
dont see myself worthy of reviewing this 
one as much as describing it. The vocals, 
the guitar work, everything works. Please 
get this. Now.
on soundtracks). What else can I say; its 
Slayer!
#2 God Hates us All, Slayer 
Well, maybe just you. Reports of exper
imentation by the kings of metal are true. 
And by doing so, they have taken their 
sound and expanded it. Picking up where 
Diabolus left off, they infuse a heavy bass 
thump and sinister groove into everything 
they play. Also cool is the fact that they 
include the hard-to-find Here comes the 
pain and Bloodline (previously released
And the #1 draft pick goes to ...
#1 Live Insurrection, Halford 
To some, picldng a live album as the 
best CD of the year may seem wrong. But 
not this one. Following on the heels of the 
most beautiful comeback album 
Ressurection this side of a Van Halen 
reunion album, Live Insurrection gives us 
a taste of what it was like to witness the 
rebirth of the metal god. As we follow 
him around the world, we get to hear 
tunes from Rob Halfords old band Fight 
as well as Light Comes Out Of Black, 
the thing he did with Pantera for a sound
track. Of course, for Judas Priest, the 
coolest thing was hearing for the first 
time two tracks written, but never record
ed, by Priest: Heart of a Lion and 
Prisoner of Your Eyes that Rob resur
rected from the vault. Finally, there is a 
new track Screaming in the Dark that 
proves that Resurrection wasnt a one
time thing.
Well, thats it. May the new semester 
bring you luck, happiness, and the reunion 
of Van Halen with David Lee Roth.

Mr. Roboto compilation: Whats the Big Idea? America Online soarsthanks to Potter magicROBOTO, from page B5
were sent to Plus/Minus Studios, in downtown 
Pittsburgh, where the tracks were mastered and 
put on one disc. After that, it was shipped out to 
be pressed, which takes a few weeks. The longest 
part of the process, though, was collecting the 
tracks from all 27 bands  an excruciatingly dif
ficult process, says Q.
Once the CD was shipped out to be pressed, the 
process was mostly out of the hands of the Roboto 
folk  to a point. They ran into a bit of trouble 
with one track, which was a cover of an AD/DC 
song. A bit of advice from Q: If youre doing a 
comp, dont put copyrighted tracks on it. The 
press discovered that no copyright permission 
had been obtained, and the band had to send in 
another song. Not a big deal, but another brief 
setback in a process that actually took quite a bit 
longer than anticipated. The idea to make a comp 
CD was initially kicked around last summer, and 
intended to be a sort of celebration of the Roboto 
Projects one year anniversary. (Roboto is a young 
institution, just two years old, this past 
November.)
Instead, the comp has just come out now, a 
masterpiece of 29 tracks by 27 bands, a book with 
one page for each band (and, again, made by the 
bands themselves), layed out and put together by 
Q. Instead of an anniversary celebration, Go 
Down Fighting, Come Up Smiling proceeds will 
benefit The Big Idea, a collectively-run radical 
bookstore that is currently homeless. The zine 
and book collection almost had a home last sum
mer, but a South Oakland location fell through, 
so The Big Idea is currently operating out of the 
Roboto Project, although they are distinct enti
ties.
Go Down Fighting is back from the press, the 
books are copied, and it was officially released on 
November 16. Its available for five bucks at The 
Mr. Roboto Project, at Pauls CDs, and at Brave 
New World on Craig Street.
Review:
The first track, Light it Up by Behind Enemy 
Lines starts off the 76-minute album with a burst of 
hardcore goodness, followed quickly by several 
more hard and fast songs by Choke City and Last 
Day on the Force. After a brief concern that maybe 
the Pittsburgh scene is only hardcore, it becomes 
clear that its actually just a good order for the songs 
and bands  the transitions and contrasts from 
song to song and genre to genre are obviously very 
carefully thought out. Light it Up was written in 
the studio, about Roboto, while Behind Enemy 
Lines was recording their album.
Whatever it Takes Fistful of Revolution is 
more punk, kind of an old Jimmy Eat World 
sound, before they stopped singing about any
thing but mush.
I hate to be right all the time, but youre always 
wrong. It really bothers me; I have a lot to live up 
to, sing the Blissful Idiots, in what could easily be 
the soundtrack of a generation. The poppy, light
hearted sound misleads a casual listener to 
assume the lyrics are equally light-hearted.
The Control Group brings in a more intense 
sound  heavy, and bearing a message of rejec
tion of formula, of routine. Theres one thing 
they cant stop, and this I know: So let it snow.
When All Else Fails by the McCarthy 
Commission comes like a surprise. Screams of 
this is our last resort seem like a somewhat 
hopeless message on an album full of rebellion 
and unity. The songs on the comp are almost 
entirely political, social
Following the almost indecipherable (but everexciting) screams from Gunspiking, Creta 
Bourzias thrilling guitar on Knuckles and 
Creases makes it hard to sit still. As the album 
continues, it becomes clear that it is not a disc to 
do homework to. It is a disc to get riled up by, one 
to listen to when it seems like no one is cooperat
ing and no one is willing to help fix the problems 
so evident in society.
And then theres Grand Buffet. The 
Candybars remix is initially the most annoying 
song in the history of songs. But after that stage, 
the song borders on hilarity. Its hard to listen to 
without cracking up completely. It breaks the 
intensity built up from the last few songs, which is 
then cranked up again by the over-the-top rock of 
Tabula Rasa. Their Cast Iron Image rocks hard 
and harder, really sing-along-able, but not in the 
traditional, silly way  just enough to be glad 
that the lyrics are in the companion book.
Fortiori cranks up the hardcore vigor again, fol
lowed by Crucial Unit yelling one of the best 
songs on the disc: P.D.A! P.D.A! We dont need 
your P.D.A! Holding hands is not that bad; leave 
the rest for alone in bed! A model to follow? 
Indeed.
Intro to Pterodactyls experimental and slight
ly strange sound lowers the hardcore energy 
with Dont Go in the Water, which is converted 
into the gloriously crusty old-school sound of
Caustic Christ.
Horsepower by the Modey Lemon keeps up 
that energy, which is raised even higher by 
Jumbos Back to the Feed Farm.
Pikadori and Io  both bands that are phe
nomenal live  each present one intense, intel
lectual song to ask for a closer listen.
Generic acapella hip hop with shoddy record
ing equipment from the Hip Criticis attacks the 
current political system: Theres only one party 
in this two-party system, and that party aint at 
my house.
And then it gets more local than before! 
Knives, by Teddy Duchamps Army, was record
ed in March of this year at WRCT.
Energy rises with the slightly electronic sounds 
of (appropriately) the Microwaves, and then the 
entertainment value gets better and better with 
TBA: self-proclaimed Western PA jug-core at its 
finest. j
The indecipherable lyrics issue arises again 
with Free Barabbass down-with-hypocrites, upwith-real-rebellion anthem. Then the grrlpunk 
sounds of World B cause involuntary jumping up 
and down and yelling along  Construction 
Parasite is one of the best songs on the entire 
disc.
Silver Tongued Devils classic rock sounds 
(sonic punk) bring the album to a rowdy near
end, which is completed by the Arco Flute 
Foundation in a bizarre sound experiment.
Go Down Fighting, Come Up Smiling does what 
it is supposed to do, and does it very well. The 
local bands (95 percent of which are Roboto reg
ulars, according to Q) are well represented, and 
the variety of genres and sounds on the disc make 
it what this compilation should be: a comprehen
sive collection of really good local music.
NEW YORK (AP)  When 
Time Warner closed its merger 
with America Online in January, 
hopes were still high that AOLs 
Internet wizardry would spur the 
new company ahead of rivals. 
Now AOL Time Warner Inc. is 
soaring again, thanks to an older 
kind of magic: box office riches, 
courtesy of Harry Potter.
In fact, the young wizards 
blowout showing so far is lead
ing some to believe that Potter 
could become one of the biggest 
film franchises of all time, up 
there with Star Wars.
It could hardly come at a bet
ter time for AOL Time Warner. 
Hopes of more supercharged 
growth at its online division are 
fading, and its many magazines 
and cable networks have been 
clobbered by an advertising 
slump. The company has been 
trimming staff and making 
other cost cuts throughout the 
year.
And along came Harry. Having 
plowed through several box 
office records, Harry Potter and 
the Sorcerers Stone has already 
taken in $220.1 million in its first 
three weeks since opening 
November 16, placing it in con
tention for a spot among the top 
10 box office winners if it breaks 
through $300 million. Many ana
lysts expect it will.
Even as it basks in box office 
returns, the company is already 
putting Harry to work in other 
ways. Walt Disney Co.s ABC net
work just paid an estimated $130 
million for the rights to broad
cast the first two movies. Then 
theres the future video releases 
and consumer product market
ing.
All told, the Harry Potter fran
chise could be worth as much as 
$700 million in profits for each 
film over the next several years, 
according to estimates from 
Salomon Smith Barney analyst 
Jill Krutick. That would come 
close to the average of $1.1 bil
lion earned by each of the Star 
Wars movies.
Then theres the long term. 
The next film, Harry Potter and 
the Chamber of Secrets, has 
already begun shooting and is 
due out next November. Warner 
Bros, also has the rights to the 
other two books already in print
plus options on the following 
three, for a possible grand total 
of seven.
Whether the franchise will 
last that long is anyones guess. 
Any number of things can go 
wrong, including a box office 
flop or wearing out the brand 
with too much exposure. But if 
all goes well, Gordon Hodge, an 
analyst at Thomas Weisel 
Partners, estimates that a full 
run of the seven films could 
generate a grand total of $10 
billion in revenues over the next 
seven to 10 years.
Harry Potter may have become 
a hit the old fashioned 
Hollywood way, by selling tickets 
based on a very popular book. 
But the movie benefited from the 
marketing muscle of its corpo
rate parent AOL Time Warner, 
which put out the soundtrack on 
its Atlantic record label and pro
moted the film on AOL.
Not every member of the AOL 
Time Warner corporate family 
was joining the cheerleading. 
Time magazine, which feistily 
rejects suggestions that it favors 
its parent company, gave the 
movie a poor review. Time called 
Harry Potter wizardry without 
magic and said it was a movie 
by the numbers.
Entertainment Weekly, another 
magazine under AOL Time 
Warners Time Inc. publishing 
arm, didnt pull punches either. 
This long, dense, specialeffects-laden movie ... feels as 
familiar as worn flannel, EW 
said in its review.
Knowing that they have a long 
franchise ahead of them, Warner 
Bros, managers have been care
ful not to overplay the Harry 
Potter brand. The movie has a 
single sponsor, Coca-Cola, and 
fewer than 90 licensing partners, 
compared to about 200 for bigticket movies like Batman, 
Krutick says.
But already concerns are 
emerging that Harry Potter may 
be too commercial for its own 
good. Peter Bart, the influential 
editor of the Hollywood trade 
magazine Variety, wrote in a 
recent column that the movie 
represents the apotheosis of a 
new genre  the corporate 
movie. It wasnt shot, it was man
ufactured.
Globe mourns Beatle great George Harrison after death at age 58
NEW YORK  (AP) Paul McCartney called him my 
baby brother. A fan thought him quiet and nice and 
powerful. Musicians and music lovers on Friday 
mourned the death of George Harrison, the quiet 
Beatle who fit in famously, if not always happily, 
alongside his more colorful bandmates.
I am devastated and very, very sad, McCartney 
told reporters outside his London home Friday. He 
was a lovely guy and a very brave man and had a won
derful sense of humor. He is really just my baby broth
er.
Harrison, at 58 the youngest Beatle, died at 1:30 
p.m. Thursday at a friends Los Angeles home after a 
battle with cancer, longtime friend Gavin De Becker 
told The Associated Press late Thursday. Harrisons 
wife, Olivia, and son Dhani, 24, were with him.
He left this world as he lived in it, conscious of God, 
fearless of death, and at peace, surrounded by family 
and friends, the family said in a statement.
With Harrisons death, there remain two surviving 
Beatles, McCartney and Ringo Starr. John Lennon was 
shot to death by a deranged fan in 1980.
The Beatles were four distinct personalities joined 
as a singular force in the rebellious 1960s, influenc
ing everything from hair styles to music. Whether 
meditating, dropping acid or sending up the squares 
in the film A Hard Days Night, the band inspired 
millions.
The story of the Beatles was as much a story of 
their fans: the rebels who identified with Lennon, the 
girls who fell for Paul, the little kids who adored 
Ringo.
Harrisons appeal was harder to define. He wasnt 
the cleverest Beatle, that was John. Paul was the cutest 
and Ringo the most lovable. But there was something 
about Harrison  the mysticism, the quiet compe
tence, even the moodiness  that endeared him to 
fans and musicians alike.
Edna McDonald, 49, from the Welsh mining town of 
Llanelli, recalled seeing the Beatles perform in Bristol, 
England, as a teen-ager. While her friends chose Paul 
McCartney as their favorite Beatle, she said she was 
drawn to Harrison.
He was quiet, different from the others, 
McDonald, vacationing in New York, said softly at 
Strawberry Fields, a Lennon tribute site in Central 
Park. I respected him more for that. I was always 
influenced by how he was a silent partner but had a lot 
of influence on the group. It showed me that you could 
be quiet and nice and powerful at the same time.
Ayessa Rourke, 43, a giraffe keeper at the Los 
Angeles Zoo, brought roses and wiped away tears at 
the Beatles star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
He was just a lovely person and a great example of 
what a human can do, and the great things we are all 
capable of, she said.
As the news of his death spread, radio stations
played music by the Beatles and by Harrison, and fans 
grieved. They gathered at Strawberry Fields and left 
bouquets and tributes at the gate of Harrisons 19th 
century Gothic mansion in Henley-on-Thames in 
England.
But Harrison never cared for all the attention. He 
preferred being a musician to being a star, and soon 
soured on Beatlemania  the screaming girls, the 
hair-tearing mobs, the wild chases from limos to gigs 
and back to limos. Like Lennon, his memories of the 
Beatles were tempered by what he felt was lost in all 
the madness.
There was never anything, in any of the Beatle 
experiences really, that good: Even the best thrill soon 
got tiring, Harrison wrote in his 1979 book, I, Me, 
Mine. Your own space, man, its so important. Thats 
why we were doomed, because we didnt have any. We 
were like monkeys in a zoo.
Still, in a 1992 interview with The Daily Telegraph, 
Harrison confided: We had the time of our lives: We 
laughed for years.
Musicians enjoyed his company. He was close to Eric 
Clapton, Bob Dylan, Tom Petty and Jeff Lynne. He 
spoke warmly of hanging out with Dylan and The 
Band in Woodstock in the late 60s, free from the 
games and grudges that helped bring the Beatles 
down.
When he and buddies Dylan and Petty formed the 
Traveling Wilburys in the late 1980s, Harrison seemed 
to rediscover what he once loved about the Beatles: a 
gathering of friends committed to music and carefree 
about individual glory.
Harrison wasnt a guitar hero like Clapton or Jimi 
Hendrix - that wasnt what the Beatles stood for. But 
his work, modeled on Chuck Berry and Carl Perkins 
among others, was essential.
He often blended with the bands joyous sound, but 
also rocked out wildly on Long Tall Sally and turned 
slow and dreamy on Something. His jangly 12-string 
Rickenbacker was featured in A Hard Days Night 
and helped inspire the Byrds, who used the instrument 
on their groundbreaking, folk-rock hit Mr. 
Tambourine Man.
Although his songwriting was overshadowed by the 
great Lennon-McCartney team, Harrison did con
tribute such classics as Here Comes the Sun and 
Something. He also taught the young Lennon how to 
play the guitar.
As he said himself, how do you compare with the 
genius of John and Paul? But he did  very well, rock 
star and activist Bob Geldof told BBC radio.
Harrisons quiet, public image was summed up in 
the first Beatles song he wrote, Dont Bother Me, 
which appeared on the groups second album.
But he also had a wry sense of humor that helped 
shape the Beatles irreverent charm, memorably com
plementing Lennons cutting wit and Starrs cartoonish appeal.
At their first recording session under George Martin, 
the producer reportedly asked the young musicians to 
tell him if they didnt like anything. Harrisons 
response: Well, first of all, I dont like your tie.
He was even funny about his own mortality. As 
reports of his failing health proliferated, Harrison 
recorded a new song  Horse to the Water  and 
credited it to RIP Ltd. 2001.
George was a best friend of mine, Starr said in a 
. statement. We will miss George for his sense of love, 
his sense of music and his sense of laughter.
After the Beatles broke up in 1970, Harrison had 
sporadic success. In addition to The Traveling 
Wilburys, he organized the concert for Bangladesh in 
New York, and produced films that included Monty 
Pythons Life of Brian.
Harrison was born Feb. 25, 1943, in Liverpool, one 
of four children of Harold and Louise Harrison. His 
father was a former ships steward and a bus conduc
tor.
At 13, Harrison bought his first guitar and befriend
ed Paul McCartney at school. McCartney introduced 
him to Lennon, who had founded a band called the 
Quarry Men  Harrison was allowed to play if one of 
the regulars didnt show up.
When I joined, he didnt really know how to play 
the guitar; he had a little guitar with three strings on it 
that looked like a banjo, Harrison recalled of Lennon 
during testimony in a 1998 court case against the 
owner of a bootleg Beatles recording.
I put the six strings on and showed him all the 
chords  it was actually me who got him playing the 
guitar. He didnt object to that, being taught by some
one who was the baby of the group. John and I had a 
very good relationship from very early on.
As the Beatles evolved from grinning moptops to 
serious musicians, so did Harrison. He became inter
ested in the sitar while making the 1965 film Help! and 
introduced it to a generation of Western listeners on 
Norwegian Wood, a song by Lennon from the Rubber 
Soul album. He also began contributing more of his 
own material.
Among his compositions were I Need You for the 
soundtrack of Help; If I Needed Someone on Rubber 
Soul; Within You, Without You on Sgt. Pepper; and 
While My Guitar Gently Weeps on the White Album.
Late in 1966, after the Beatles had ceased touring, 
Harrison went to India, where he studied the sitar with 
Ravi Shankar.
In 1967, Harrison introduced the other Beatles to 
the teaching of the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, and all 
four took up transcendental meditation. Harrison was 
the only one who remained a follower, with Lennon 
mocking the Maharishi in his song Sexy Sadie.
By the late 60s, Harrison was clearly worn out from 
being a Beatle and openly bickered with McCartney,
arguing with him on camera during the filming of Let 
It Be.
As the Beatles grew apart, Harrison collaborated 
with Clapton on the song Badge, performed with 
Lennons Plastic Ono Band and produced his most 
acclaimed solo work, the triple album All Things Must 
Pass. The sheer length of that 1970 release confirmed 
the feelings of Harrison fans that he deserved better 
than his supporting role in the Beatles.
But one of those songs, the hit My Sweet Lord, 
later drew Harrison into a lawsuit, which he lost, by 
the copyright owner of Hes So Fine.
Another Harrison project also led to legal problems. 
Moved by the starvation caused by the war between 
Bangladesh and Pakistan, Harrison in 1971 staged two 
benefit concerts in New York and recruited such per
formers as Starr, Shankar, Clapton and Dylan.
Anticipating such later superstar benefits as Live Aid 
and Farm Aid, the Bangladesh concerts were also a 
cautionary tale about counterculture bookkeeping. 
Although millions were raised and the three-record 
concert release won a Grammy for album of the year, 
allegations emerged over mishandling of funds and 
the money long stayed in escrow.
Despite the occasional hit single, including the 
Lennon tribute song All Those Years Ago, Harrisons 
solo career did not live up to initial expectations. 
Reviewing a greatest-hits compilation, Village Voice 
critic Robert Christgau likened him to a borderline 
hitter they can pitch around after the sluggers 
(Lennon and McCartney) are traded away.
Harrisons family life was steadier. He married 
Olivia Arias in 1978, a month after Dhani was born.
The next year, he founded Handmade Films to pro
duce Life of Brian. He sold the company for $8.5 mil
lion in 1994.
For all his disparagement of the material world, 
Harrison kept a steady eye on the bottom line, an atti
tude set to a sharp rock riff in his song Taxman.
George wasnt head in the clouds all the time. 
When it came to business and all that, he was feet very 
much on the ground, Michael Palin of Monty Pythons 
Flying Circus told BBC radio.
Fame continued to haunt Harrison. In 1999, he was 
stabbed several times by a man who broke into his 
home. The man, who thought the Beatles were witch
es and believed himself on a divine mission to kill 
Harrison, was acquitted by reason of insanity.
But fame also continued to enrich him. The follow
ing year, he saw a compilation of Beatles No. 1 singles, 
1, sell millions of copies.
The thing that pleases me the most about it is that 
young people like it, Harrison said in an interview 
with the AP. I think the popular music has gone truly 
weird. Its either cutesy-wutesy or its hard, nasty 
stuff. Its good that this has life again with the 
youth.

IOF LIGHT.
The curse gave -the boy an insatiable drive to control the world through inventions that revolutionized industries but would always exhibit some fundamental flaw that would eventually spell his undoing.
Still, despite his failures, the 
boy would always arise the next 
day with a new plan that might 
take years to implement, but 
would be destined to fail.
Once upon a time, there lived 
a boy who was very clever but never happy, because when he 
was young he was mistaken 
for a prince and was cursed.
ANOTHER 
GREAT IDEA 
I SEE...
Day after day, month after month 
year after year, the boy 
continued his thankless task. 
People were born, lived, and 
died, empires rose and fell, 
their memories scattering 
into the void of space and time, 
but somehow the boy lived on, forgetting nothing.
And, as the days grew colder, 
the stars in the night sky 
blinked out one by one until 
there was only one left, and 
only the boy was left watching 
it. And one day, at long last 
the final star collapsed into 
a single point, and the boy 
could finally rest in peace.
Over the millennia, the boy 
gradually became very tired, 
yet he could not end his 
empty mission. Still, he 
managed to stay sane with the 
belief that perhaps someday 
it would all end.
WOW, YOU'RE RIGHT

We have no reason to believe that you are, in any way, associated with terrorist actions. But wed like to question you anyway.
You have certain demographic similarities to those accused of conspiring to murder their classmates at New Bedford High, so we bet that your friends are loner high school kids with bomb making materials, too.
As you can see, the fact that you are white, middle class, and between the ages of 15 and 17, you have many similarities to the criminals involved in the plot we are trying to unravel, and therefore can probably give us helpful information.
