Trustees Approve Plan 
For Dorm Remodeling
Game Room, Lounge 
Are Among Changes 
Slated for McGill
Plans have been completed for 
the redecoration of another mens 
'dormitory unit. The Board of 
Trustees has given a conditional 
approval for the remodeling of a 
dormitory. No definite action will 
be taken until there is complete 
assurance that no outbreaks of 
senior ducking will occur in the 
 dorms this year.
Although a decision has not 
been reached as to which dorm 
will be remodeled, it appears very 
likely that McGill Hall, the fresh
men dorm, will be altered. The 
men responsible for the proposed 
design and construction of McGill, 
as well as the other renovated 
dormitories, are: Mr. Larry Miller, 
Supervisor of Equipment ; Mr. 
Frank Kook, Superintendent of 
Buildings and Grounds, and Mr, 
Scuilli, General Foreman.
The dorm will be remodeled In 
much the same manner us Boss 
Hall. What was formerly the 
sleeping porch will be an enclosed 
room, and the telephone room will 
be lined with cork so as to sub
duo sound and to insure privacy. 
The walls of the rooms are to 
be lined with tile and the lloors 
with cement.
A game room with facilities lor 
pin;; pong and pool will be in
stalled in the basement. The 
lounge will be furnished with 
comfortable furniture, giving it 
a eheeriul and good-looking ap
pearance. Another feature to be 
included is the installation of - a 
wash stand in every room.
The rent rates have not yet 
been decided, but they will prob
ably be similar to those of Boss 
Hall.

Plans Made 
For Summer 
School Session
Shop, Laboratory 
Courses Offered 
In All Colleges
Few students realize that the 
Summer Sessions of Carnegie In
stitute of Technology begin on 
Commencement Day and extend 
until the Saturday before the 
opening of classes in September. 
During every week of this period 
some part of the Summer Session 
is in operation.
The Pre-summer Session of the 
College of Engineering begins on 
June 3. Many students in the Col
lege of Engineering are required 
to take shop and laboratory sub
jects during this period. The 
scheduling of students for the 
Pre-Summer Session has already 
been completed. Courses are of
fered in the Departments of Shops, 
Chemistry and Mechanical Engin
eering. In the regular Summer 
Session, the sophomore and upper 
class subjects of the College of 
Engineering begin with registra
tion on Monday, June 17. These 
subjects, which continue for a 
period of eight weeks, include 
mathematics, mechanics and phys
ics. The freshman subjects of the 
College of Engineering in mathe
matics, chemistry, English, draw
ing and descriptive geometry, and 
social relations are offered in a 
six weeks' Summer Session which 
begins with registration on Friday 
and Saturday, June 28 and 29. 
The freshman subjects are sched
uled at a later date in order that 
they will not interfere with the 
required shop subjects of the Pre
summer Session. The elective sub
jects of the Departments of Psy
chology and Education and Eco
nomics and Business Law are also 
offered during the six-week pe
riod.
In the College oX Fine Arts, sixweek subjects in Architecture are 
offered during the period begin
ning June 17. The other depart
ments begin their summer ses
sions on June 28. Courses are of
fered in drama, music, painting 
and design, and sculpture. Many 
of the students in. music and in 
painting and design are pursuing 
graduate courses leading to the 
degree of Master of Fine Arts. In 
I he Department of Music, Dr. M. 
Emett Wilson, Professor of Music 
at Ohio State University, will bo 
a visiting member of the faculty.
In Margaret Morrison College 
graduate subjects are offered in 
home economics, The new gradu
ate curriculum in this field was 
introduced in the Summer Session 
of 1939, when 25 students enrolled 
lor the program of studies leading 
to the Master's Degree. This sum
mer will probably see an expan
sion of work In this field.
Another new feature of the 
Coming Summer Session will be 
a course in the diagnosis and reinAboveo:Pr bo sidP vnb

Review of Years Social Life 
Discloses Many New Features
By Barbara Kramer
When we view a hillside in 
Pittsburgh at night we see a world 
of lightssome bright and oth
ers dim, some sparkling and oth
ers dull. So, too, is our view of 
the past school year; certain 
events stand out as sparkling af
fairs, others dim soft lights. But 
the brightest lights of all are the 
lights that are reflected from the 
a flairs that were instituted this 
yearthose lights that began to 
flicker this year and will continue 
to burn forever and ever, Amen. 
Just such an affair is Sadie Hawlcins Day.
This day of days for Carnegie 
Tech's bold femininity was insti
tuted last fall with much pomp 
and fanfare. Beginning with a 
cannon shot, which was the signal 
for all Lii Abners to begin run
ning not-so-fast and  all Daisy 
Maes to pursue just-a-little-iaster, the Day reached its climax in 
the dance to which all the victor
ious maidens took their swains. 
This dance remains a shining ex
ample to Carnegie womanhood of 
what a girl can do with Student 
Councils assistance.
^-1 PUBLICATIONS ELEC1
Following on the heels of the 
Females Day to Crow was an
other triumph for the coedsthe 
election of the first Snow Queen. 
This was an important event, not 
only because it is the establish
ment of a precedent, but because 
it demonstrated the optimism of 
Tech students who, with the fire 
and verve of youth, elected Patty 
Ilaisllp as Queen of the Snow to 
rule over the slush of the past 
winter. Certainly, we need such 
a burning faith in Nature to melt 
the snow of future dreary winters. 
Long live tho Snow Queen.
A third bright light beckoning 
us to come and enjoy life with it, 
is a prOduct of the Mens Dormi
tory  'Council. This year for the 
first time the dormitories had a 
.big name-band for their spring 
danceEnoch Light by name. 
With Light as the leader of a long 
line of successors (we hope) we 
can look forward to next years 
season with anticipation; for 
Niny strange and wondrous ad
vancements have been wrought on 
th'*\ Tech Campus in this year,

Sculptors Troubled 
With Animal Life
By Walter Haller
Printers have their type lice 
and galley-stretchers, as any in
telligent plebe knows, but even 
many brilliant sophomores have 
not heard about the cockroaches 
which loaf around the sculpture 
department. The clay used by the 
sculptors attracts cockroaches,  it 
seems, and the students have 
learned to avoid the tub where the 
clay is stored.
The pesky creatures range in 
size all the way from an eighth 
of an inch to more than an inch.
Their favorite places of habi
tation seem to be shoes and sinks. 
Ralph Steinberg, a model for the 
Sculptors, had definite proof of 
the peculiar traits of the quaint 
creatures (meaning the cock
roaches, of course), in a recent 
experience. Seems as how our 
friend Ralph had taken off his 
shoes to go into a pose for the 
benefit of the students of the de
partment. Returning to his dress
ing room, he shoved his xoot into 
his shoe. Feeling what he thought 
was a lump in the shoe, he put 
more pressure on his foot, but 
still the lump remained. When he 
took off his shoe, guess what he 
found it in! Thats right, boys and 
girls, a life-sized cockroach, fully 
an inch and a half long, was non
chalantly climbing his way out of 
Ralphs shoe.
Moral: Even if your heart is in 
the work, look twice before your 
foot is in the shoe.

4:30 P. M., Miss Henrietta Rosen~,''b._will present an open lesstraiu... . in the Ex_

Arts.
Improvisation, which is the act 
of composing poetry or music ex
temporaneously (in this case, mu
sic), hafc been lost as an educa
tion, but has remained with some 
as an enjoyment. In fact, it is 
quite prominent with the Gyp
sies throughout the world.
Today, many music teachers 
would like to renovate this art, 
as it is marvelous ear-training. 
Miss Rosenstrauch said, Every
one can express himself in music, 
so long as he has musical ability. 
She is one who feels that this art 
of improvising should be revived,
At the open lesson, Miss Rosen
strauch, with a group of her stu
dents, will demonstrate improvis
ation of voice, instrument and 
movement.

he has been a member of the Tar

Business Manager during the past 
year. Dave earned his numerals in 
tennis and has been a manager of 
the Basketball team. A fast game 
of tennis, followed by plenty of 
sleep is his ideal form of relaxa
tion.
A fan of Benny Goodman, 
Dave keeps the. boys in the house 
hep to the King of Swings latest 
styles. His musical education 
started when he was very young, 
with piano lessons. Finally his 
music teacher gave him his choice 
either practice or play marbles 
in the street. Dave has a reputa
tion in Camden for being one of 
the best Knuckle-down shoot
ers. Anyway, he suspected his 
teacher wore , a wig.
S.trangely enough, a close kin
ship to fossils is felt by Dave, for 
he once had a job in the Paleon
tology department of Carnegie 
Museum. He would carefully pick 
out the ancient bones from the 
rocks, and would then throw both 
the rocks and fossils away.
In the future Dave will be 
working for the Trane Co. of Wis
consin, where he will be on the 
sales engineering staff. He hopes 
to catch up on his reading, and 
straighten out his philosophers. 
The book which impressed him 
the most in school was John Stu
art Mills On Liberty. Some of 
those book reviews which you 
have read in the Technical were 
written by Dave.
When asked where his Frat pin

Social Studies 
Enrollment 
Will Be Limited
Dr. Willard E. Hotchkiss, Chair
man of the Social Relations Pro

members of the Social Relations 
teaching staff are inviting a select
ed group of Juniors in the College 
of Engineering to a meeting in In
dustries 231, on May 16, at 4:30 
p.m. The purpose of the meeting 
is to explain the nature and pur
pose of the Social Relations Pro
jects course which will be open 
to a limited group of Seniors next 
year. For the most part, the invi
tation. has been confined to stud
ents in the upper quarter of the 
class but Juniors who are partic
ularly interested in social studies 
and who have shown special apti
tude for them are welcome to at
tend.
Registration for the Social Re
lations Projects course will be 
limited to not more than a dozen 
students. Such students will take 
the course as a General Studies 
elective with nine units of credit 
a semester. Each of the students 
admitted will make a careful study 
of a special project in social rela
tions under the direction of a 
faculty adviser. Opportunity will 
be offered to obtain valuable ex
perience in the use of library fa
cilities and in the preparation of 
reports. Individual students will 
make periodic reports upon the 
projects with which they are occu
pied at seminar meetings which 
will be held at regular Intervals 
throughout the year. These reports 
will be discussed and critl/.ed by 
the members of the seminar.

THISTLEDOWN
SOFTBALLRS START PLAYOFFS
- By Bill Floyd, Sports Editor .
Intramural Board Headache
Marse Eyman and all his happy friends are holding private 
De'eB pulling parties these days over the happy news that in a 
m ajority ol: the leagues entered in the softball competition there 
is a two or three way tie for first honors. The Citcom Clan seems 
tcj) Have fared quite well up to date, and have yet to play only 
the Transfers in order to obtain complete domination of their 
di vision. In the Fraternity group there seems to be a hopeless 
w/ess, for no less than three teams are tied for the place in the 
in itial bracket. However, in spite of this jumble Mi'. Eyman con
fidently states that the Board hopes to have the schedule com
pleted by the end of this week. This means that the final game 
in this series of contests should be played no later than this 
coming Friday.
Sweepstakes Buggies
The boys on the hill, pulled the surprise of the day last 
/day when they, appeared with their entirely new aluminum 
ushmobile. Although there had been a few rumors circulating 
.round the campus concerning this unknown entry, few were 
aware of the fact that the ten-drinkers were entering an en
tirely new charge. Bill Mercier, builder of the Beta Baby, dida;thorough job in constructing this design winning buggy.
The saddest crew 100 the campus this past week were the 
worthies of old Phi Kappa. After spending many hours planning 
and building their, pushmobile the wheels, which had been speci
ally constructed, failed to arrive in time for this annual race. As 
a result, these men who were given more than an even chance 
to win the event were forced to scratch their entry at the last 
moment.
Again the Kappa Sigs entered their fishy looking buggy, and 
again, as in the past five years, they romped home the winner. 
It appears to be the campus-wide opinion that the boys who first 
constructed this pushmobile threw in some wings here and there.
Activities Cup
During the call day ceremonies Queenie Betty'Williams pre
sented the Intramural Boards point trophy to Bob Patterson, the 
representative of the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity. This group of 
men finished first in Intramural basketball, bowling, and swim
ming, and at the present time are strong contenders for the soft
ball championship.
New Surface for Soccer Field
According to present plans, when you return next year the 
soccer field will have an entirely new appearance. Arrange
ments have already been made to coArer this section of Tartan 
property with a quick-drying, well-conditioned, and easilyscraped surface. This information a la Fuzzy Byman.

Tech Teams Suffer Downfall 
From Last Years Showings
In looking back over the sports 
parade for the past year, a rather 
sorry picture is revived in the 
minds of the Tech student body.
Although the Tartan football team 
was one of the potentially strong
est teams In the country at the 
start of the grid campaign, they 
failed to live up to expectations.
The basketball team also had a 
poor season but It was much bet
ter than most people expected.
Th(* really bright spot of the year 
was Ih<* swimming team which 
had the best season of any Tech 
lank team yet. The hookey team 
also had a disappointing season, 
but they participated In many 
hard fought and thrilling games.
This last season was probably 
tlu most disappointing season in 
,Tech football history because the 
beijt season yet was expected of 
thii powerful Tartan squad. After 
defeating the Temple team, the 
N. I Y. U. Violets again proved to 
fie a jinx for Tech and started us 
on the decline. All the important 
games of the year were lost, most
ly! by small scores, such as the 
Ptt, Duquesne and Notre Dame 
games; Many outstanding football - 
 eijs played their final season for
ech, some of whom are Condit, 
treigle, Gumbert and Schmidt, 
tuba, Fisher, Laposki and Kuenzli are left as a neucleus for next 
year's team.
At the beginning of the new 
year, Bill Kern lelt Tech to go 
to West Vii-ginia to coach, and 
Eddie Baker was elevated to the 
position of head coach. Two other 
Pitt men, Skladany and Glassford, 
were obtained as his aides, Glass
ford coming here from Manhattan.
Stark Heads Hoopsters 
Under the leadership of Rube 
Stark, captain for the second year 
of the basketball team, the TarT 
tans had an erratic season. Some
times they were worldbeaters and 
other times they seemed unable to 
beat some of the local high school 
aggregations, but on the average 
they had a better season than was 
expected. Four seniors, Stark,
Tumpane, Sturgeon and Burke, 
wound up their final season and 
will be greatly missed next year.
However, a fine group of fresh
man players are expected to olset these losses. The freshman 
team lost only a few games, one 
being to W. J. and this was large
ly due to one enemy player, PortHalfertys Men

Meet Today
Trackmen Travel 
To Geneva Saturday 
For Annual Contest
By Crawford Murton, 43
The Skibo cindermen will pit 
their skill against the Waynesburg 
and Grove City clubs this after
noon at four oclock. Co-captain 
Red Sturgeon predicts a Tartan 
victory in this triangular meet, 
although the Waynesburg sprint
er, Wilkins, a colored boy, will be 
a source of constant worry to our 
boys. The Techmen were victor
ious last season, as they have been 
in this meet for the past several 
years, in spite of the five firsts 
that Wilkins took from them. The 
Waynesburg Flash is a dearth to 
opponents in the cinder events, 
which incidentally have been the 
Tartan forte in all of their meets 
this year. The Grove City men 
present little threat to the aspira
tions of our team in this tilt which 
is being held as a result of the 
Waynesburg tourney being rained 
out.
On Saturday, May 18, one of the 
most important contests of the 
season will be held at Geneva 
with eight colleges participating. 
Tech for a period of several years 
and although the outcome will be 
closely contested we predict a re
peat for the Scottish laddies. The 
loss of Merlyn Condit from the 
Plaid roster has meant relinquish
ing at least eight points in each 
tourney from the Tech tally. 
However, if the rest of the Tar
tan team displays the excellent 
form they showed in the Geneva 
meet, Carnegie will finish this 
year with an enviable record.

Tilting Event
Molvie and Fiegly 
Flounder to Victory 
I11 Close Contest
In spite of strenuous opposition 
on the part of the elements, canoes 
were tilted and huskies were duck
ed in Panther Hollow last Sunday 
between eleven thirty and one o
clock. With twenty odd teams en
tered in the event the battle raged 
for an hour and one half. One un
fortunate team was attacked so en
ergetically that their paddle shot 
through the air and impaled itself 
in the lagoons muddy bed. Ap
proximately two hundred people 
witnessed the spectacle and had 
a good belly laugh at the antics of 
the tillers. Although the two final
ists teams were Molvie-Fiegly and 
Dobrus-lless, the PiKa representa
tion of Wood and Patterson dis
played the most artistic pursuance 
of their, objective. The MolvieFiegly combination emerged vic
torious after pummeling Dobrus 
from head to foot. Chairman Klein 
presented the victors with a very 
attractive cup as a reward for their 
tribulations.

ItccI Burch
er Mackey, a former freshman 
player at Tech. The captain of 
next years team will be Randall 
Burch, the high scoring forward 
oi the Skibo hoopsters.
The bright spot of the sports 
program for the year was the 
swimming team which had the 
best season of any Tech team yet, 
winning eight and losing two 
meets. The closest to this stand
ing was in 1932 when they won 
si and lost one. Hirsch, Lockhead, 
Molvie and Vance were the most 
prominent members of the squad, 
Molvie being elected captain for 
next season. The future does not 
look very bright because nine men 
will be lost due to graduation.
The hockey team had a discour
aging but interesting season of 
thirteen games. Nine of these were 
defeats, but six were lost by only 
one goal. Five of the members 
of the team were seniors, and next 
years team will be built around 
goalie and captain-elect Fred 
Feiler who is probably the best 
goalie in the league.

Kappa Sigs Win Speed 
Trophy In Sweepstakes
Betas New Buggy 
Cops Design Cup; 
PiKAs Crack Up
Climaxing a thrilling race, the 
Kappa Sig Buggy outdistanced all 
competitors to win the coveted 
Sweepstakes Speed Cup. Second 
in the race, and winner of the De
sign Trophy was the buggy of Beta 
Theta Pi.
Friday morning found a large 
crowd of excited students watch
ing the qualifying runs of the re
spective entries. The men from 
upper Forbes Street, featuring a 
new buggy constructed of shiny 
sheet aluminum, jumped into first 
place from the start. Never re
linquishing their lead, the Beta 
men led the S. A. E. and Theta 
Xi crafts to the finish line in the 
fast time of 3:02. In the second 
heat the Kappa Sigs D. U.s, Delts, 
and PiKAs competed for top hon
ors. While battling up the first hill 
for the best position, the PiKAs 
buggy met with misfortune and 
crashed into the curb. Contrary to 
much opinion on faulty construc
tion, the mishap was due only to 
a wheel rim which collapsed and 
tangled the steering gear. In spite 
of not qualifying for the finals the 
P. K. A. buggy was run on trial 
and finished the course in three 
minutes and fourteen seconds. Not
a bit disturbed by the crash so 
close at hand, the Kappa Sig. Delt, 
and D. U. buggies reached the top 
of the hill in short order, the Kap
pa Sigs leading by a half-length. 
However, on the long stretch down 
through Sehenley Park, the super
ior construction of the Kappa Sig 
buggy showed its real worth, and 
the other contenders were left far 
behind. Thrilling to the crowd and 
backbreaking to the pushers was 
the fierce battle between the Delt  
and D. U. buggies for second pla<|v 
position.
In spite of cool, windy weather, 
a large crowd of enthusiastic fol
lowers turned out to see the final 
run between the Kappa Sig, Beta, 
and D. U. buggies. Although the 
wind slowed down the buggies on 
the hills and made the work of the 
pushers doubly hard, the time of 
the winning buggy was 2:53, only 
six seconds slower than the rec
ord of 2:47 set by the same buggy 
two years ago.
Putting on the best performance 
of his long pushing career, Big 
John Lloyd, known to his friends 
as El Blindo, gave the Kappa Sig 
buggy almost a full lengths lead 
over the second place Beta craft 
at the top of the first hill. This 
lead was increased even more on 
the down hill stretch to almost 
thirty yards and notrelinquished 
through the race.

in the Gym we are planning the 
Awards Party at which time the 
girls who have earned the requir
ed number of points for partici
pation in athletic events will re
ceive their honors. The party is 
for all of the girls, and there will 
be food and SURPRISES. There 
will be notices on the bulletin 
board and you are requested to 
sign if you are planning to come. 
You will not want to miss this 
party, if you have your wits about 
you.
The high school play day will 
take place, as was announced be
fore on the 18 on the cut and in 
the gym. This Saturday after
noon is reserved for the seven
teen high schools invited, and a 
luncheon is planned plus a whole 
afternoon of entertainment.
Two Saturdays ago the Dance 
Club and selected dance groups 
from various womens gym classes 
under the dix-ection of Miss Doro
thy Kandich took part in the an
nual Gym Night at the downtown 
Y. M. C. A. The program consist
ed of Movement patterns by the 
Club and Dance Studies. After the 
program there was a social dance 
to the music of the High Hatters.
The board has discussed to some 
extent the program for next year, 
and the possibility of having more 
and more girls come out for 
sports, for there certainly is no 
absence of opportunity at Tech. 
At the conferences the delegates 
from here saw that many other 
colleges used clever methods of 
advertising, so to speak, and pub
licising the sports so that every
one found at least one activity in 
which to participate and keep an 
interest. Although we have an ac
tive group who are a nucleus of 
the sport group, there is lack of 
interest in general that should be 
overcome. Where is the competi
tive sportsmanship and real spirit 
in the girls? Is it all hidden be
hind books and other more interesting activities? That may be an 
excuse, but it is not an actual 
fact that the girls who do not par
ticipate in their own W.A.A. are 
too busy to do something once in 
a while. After all, if the Associa
tion isnt run just for you, and 
you, just who receives the benefits 
from it? Just ask the gal who 
knows and youll discover that 
you have missed something by not 
taking an active interest in some 
sport . . . take your choice . . . 
theyre all here . . . and just tell 
yourselves that next year you 
really will .go after that one sport 
youve always liked but never 
really gotten into it . . . And keep 
your promise. Well see you nexf 
year, and with that kind of spirit, 
the W.A.A. will be the organiza
tion you ought to make it . . .

Tech Golfers 
Lose to W. & J. 
And Duquesne
Next Match Will 
Be With Grovers 
On Their Course
The Tartan linksmen relin
quished another match to the Du
quesne aggregation last Friday on 
the Tech home course. The Duke 
clubbers defeated our men by a 
close count of five to four, in fact, 
it was so close that the victory 
hung in balance on a hook and a 
slice.
Jack Ellen and Harry Sacks 
emerged from their match with a 
loss and a victory respectively. 
John Shymosky came through for 
the Skiboers by winning his round 
four up with only two holes to go. 
It was on the eighteenth hole that 
George Tondorf met with reverses 
and lost one down. The Tartans 
took all of the best balls although 
they were won after playing six 
extra holes.
On Monday the W and J club 
defeated A1 Gubey and Paul Loveday on the Pittsburgh Field Club 
links. The Prexies succeeded in 
winning the best ball tallies also. 
The Tartan season total to date 
now stands at no wins and six 
losses.
The last match played to date 
was against Grove City to day on 
their course. Unfortunately the re
sults of this match were not avail
able before we went to press. In 
spite of the poor impression that 
th statistical record accumulated in 
their matches, the Tartans have 
yet to be overwhelmingly defeated.
Frosh Golfers 
Defeat W. & J.; 
Will Play Kiski
After several crushing defeats 
this season the Freshman Golfers 
clubbed their way to a 9-6 victory 
over the Washington and Jefferson 
mashie marvels. Although playing 
at Nemacola, the Prexy home 
links, the W. and J. lads con
sistently overputted a disgrace to 
a nice approach, and so doing 
couldnt manage to par down when 
necesary.
Last Friday the Shadyside Links 
Lads handed the Tartan Plebes a 
16Vfe-l% defeat; not enough mar
gin for a moral victory.
During the coming week Kiski 
Prep, will be guests in a return 
match. This engagement will be 
held at the Pittsburgh Field Club, 
the Carnegie home grounds. 
Strangely enough, this will be the 
first time that the team has played 
on home grounds, and they feel 
that it will be to their advantage. 
It seems that all the links played 
on so far this year have been in 
very poor condition or not worthy 
of being used for golfing. If such 
is the fact, the excellent grounds 
of the Pittsburgh Field Club 
should give an organization that is 
trying hard but not doing well a 
chance to show its ability.
SOFTBALL RESULTS
Emerging from the completion 
of their regular schedules with 
clean slates, the Citcom Clan and 
Transfer Club softball squads 
took final possession of first place 
in their respective leagues. The 
fraternity circuits finished hostili
ties with a three-way tie in one 
league and a double deadlock in 
the other.
The Clan downed a stubborn 
outfit representing the Freshmen 
of Section 8 by a 7-6 count last 
Monday, and then came back to 
mop up the Chem Engineers, 17-1 
on the following day. This mas
sacre was called at the end of the 
third inning. Little trouble was 
given the Commuters in their final 
scheduled contest when McGill 
Hall forfeited on Wednesday. 
However, the Clan played the 
Welch-Henderson team in a non
scheduled game and were beaten, 
9-2, being shut out after the first 
inning by the deceptive curves of 
pitcher Mai Hawkes of the dorm 
squad.
Five Fraternity League frays 
were played on Monday. The Tau 
Delts won a hotly-played contest 
from the ATOs by a 14-13 score, 
while the Sigma Nus had much

It is found that there are just 
four solutions, all only slightly 
different from one another, pro
vided that useless trips are avoid
ed. The successive occupants of 
the boat are as follows, odd num
bers referring to crossings in the 
forward direction and even num

or BW. (2) Br or W, respectively. 
(3) BBr. (4) Br. (5) WW. (6)

(10) Br. (11) BBr. (12) Br or W. 
(13) BBr or BW, respectively. It 
will be noticed that the reverse

To save space, it is left to the 
reader to verify, if he has not al
ready done so, that these actual
ly are solutions, and to show that 
there are no others requiring as 
few trips. As a variation, the 
problem may be changed so that 
the cannibals can all row, but 
only one of the when men. In this 
case also there are four solutions 
requiring thirteen crossings.

Council Makes 
Banquet Plans
Extra-curricular activities are 
rewarded at the end of each 
school year by an insignia taking 
the form of a key, superimposed 
on the background of which are 
the letters C. I. T. and a white 
crescent and star. This insignia 
is awarded to the students entitl
ed at a special banquet held by 
the Evening Student Council., The 
time and place for the banquet 
this year have not yet been de
cided by the committee, but the 
students who have earned this 
award will be notified by mail 
shortly.
The crescent represents the eve
ning section of school, while a 
star at the top of the key indi
cates that the student has stood 
out beyond others in his interest 
and participation in extra-curric
ular activities. The first awards 
of this nature Were made in 1025 
and since that time, the original 
insignia with the date 25 has 
been adopted as the official seal 
of the Evening Student Council.

And So They Were 
Elcetedby Proxy!
If we freshen the memories of 
Evening Student Council mem
bers about election procedure 
now, will they do something 
about it before next September? 
On the chance that they will, we 
recall the College of Engineering 
farce held last fall. It was at that 
election that in the midst of a 
bitter battle for the four places 
allotted to that school, a handful 
of proxy voles were produced and 
may have had something to do 
with the final results.
Now if proxies were the gener
al thing in the evening school, 
there would be no reason for uzC 
recognizing them. But the gener
al understanding is that students 
must be present at the election 
meetings or be deprived of the 
right to vote, although the tech
nicality is not covered by Eve
ning, Student Councils by-laws. 
Under those conditions, even 
though the proxies which have 
showed up in the past may have 
been honest ones, they should not 
have been recognized.
If Council wishes to use prox
ies, on the other hand, all stu
dents should be informed of the 
fact. Then all students would 
have the same representation in 
student affairs. Of course, if the 
Engineering elections last year 
were some sort of coup thats 
a different matter.
We believe, however, that defi
nite action should be taken to bar 
proxies from all Evening Student 
Council elections. They defeat the 
very purpose of the election party 
which is to break the ice for the 
years social schedule, and to per
mit the students to become ac
quainted among themselves. Give 
the students a proxy vote, and 
one of the incentives for coming to 
the meeting is destroyed.
Dishonesty is also encouraged 
by a proxy vote in an organiza
tion as loosely governed as the 
Evening Student Council. Suppose 
one of the Council members 
should forget his ethics, and de
cide that one of his friends should 
be elected to office. It would be 
no stupendous trick to obtain a 
fistful of ballots, fill them in with 
the names of some of his acquaint
ances, and deposit them in the 
ballot box as proxies.
Banning of proxies would ef
fectively block the temptation to 
M-ooie on election night.

G. W. HURTT, JR.
G. W. Hurtt 
Is Appointed 
Into Council
Last, but far from least of the 
1939-40 Evening Student Council 
officers, is this weeks presenta
tion by the Plaid. George William 
Hurtt, Jr., was chosen Vice-Pres
ident of the College of Engineer
ing when a vacancy occurred in 
the ranks of their officers in Jan
uary and he has fulfilled his du
ties since that time successfully 
and with acumen. He is known 
to his many friends and acquaint
ances as Bill, and is a pleasantly 
aggressiveyoung man, with dark 
hair and complexion. He is of 
medium build.
Bill is a resident of Wilkinsburg and was graduated from the 
Wilkinsburg High School where 
he participated in many activi
ties. Principal among them were 
the Drama, Science, French and 
Chess Clubs. Much of his other
wise unscheduled time was spent 
playing intramural tennis and 
iDasketball. He is. still actively in
terested in tennis and finds it a 
good form of relaxation. Golf is 
one sport which Bill started play
ing after he finished high school 
and he plans to compete in this 
years Council Golf Tournament 
providing he does not have to 
work that day.
This is his third year in the 
school although only his second 
in the Engineering School. He is 
following the Mechanical Engin
eering Course. One Insignia Key 
was awarded him for his activities 
but lie is working hard on the 
second one. He is a member of 
Nu Sigma Alpha ancl of Sigma 
Delta Phi, the new social fratern
ity.

This, my friends, will be the 
last issue of the "Plaid until next 
year. Yes, sir, were closing up 
shop and I suppose you know the 
reason why. School will he over 
in about two weeks; at least it 
will be over for those of you who 
arent planning to take any sum
mer courses. Well be back next 
year and we would like to see a 
lot of new1 faces in the Plaici, of
fice.
Working on the paper really of
fers a lot of unusual opportunities 
to the students and more of you 
should take advantage of them. 
For those of you who have writ
ing ability and Im sure there 
must be a let in the evening 
school, there are always plenty of 
stories to write. For those who 
have the ability to say a great 
deal in a limited number of 
words, there are heads which 
must be written for each story, 
ancl for those who can type, all 
the stories and heads must be 
typed.
Student Council points, which 
carry Insignia Credit, are given 
for work oh the Plaid. If there 
are any of you who would like 
to write, but find it impossible to 
come out and work Friday eve
nings, send in your stories to the 
editor before Thursday of each 
week. If your stories are good, in 
all probability they will be print
ed, and your points credited to
ward your Insignia.
Before I finish this article I 
would like to say that I have en
joyed writing again this year, and 
I hope Ill be back again next fall. 
If any of my remarks have been 
too pointed or personal, Im sor
ry for I meant no intentional in
sult to any person or group.

Economics I 
May Be Taken
Summer Schedule 
May Include C401
In a previous article appearing 
in the April 30th issue of the Plaid 
regarding an Economics I and II 
course to be given during the sum
mer session, a minimum of eight 
students was not mentioned as 
being necessary for scheduling the 
class. The course, which is to be 
held on four nights of the week 
from 7:30 until 10:30, will cost the 
student $54.00 for the complete 
semesters work.
Degree students will find this an 
unusual opportunity since by tak
ing advantage of the course, they 
will be able to complete 18 units 
of work in only eight weeks.
Those students who are inter
ested in taking the course dur
ing the supplementary terms are 
requested to see Dr. Kenneth 
Field, head of the Department of 
Economics or Mr. Dalziel McKelway, night school registrar.
Since it is necessary to have at 
least eight students to schedule 
the class, those who are interest
ed are urged to register for it as 
soon as possible.
