Intel Foundation awards 
scholarships to students
By RYAN DONOVAN
Tartan Contributing Editor
I had such a stressful week that week, 
and to get a message on Friday with 
such great news was a really great sur
prise, said Reena Singhal, sophomore 
ECE major and one of the two recipients 
of the 1998 Intel Women in Science and 
Engineering (WiSE) scholarships.
Every year, the Intel Foundation 
awards 25 WiSE scholarships to out
standing female students in scientific 
and engineering fields. This year, an 
unprecedented two CMU students re
ceived scholarships: Cindi Dennis, jun
ior physics and computer science double 
major, and Singhal.
The seven-year-old scholarship gives 
recipients $20,000 towards college tu
ition, fees, books, and living expenses 
and is renewable through students 
graduation or fifth year of study. The 
award carries an offer of a 10-week sala
ried summer internship at Intel  which 
the student is not required to take  
and provides the student with a mentor 
in her field.
The objective of the scholarship is to 
support the best of the best, said Alisa
Hampton, program officer for the Intel 
Foundation. She said that the scholar
ships are very competitive merit-based 
awards, going to students who not only 
excel in their fields but who also demon
strate aptitude in extra-curricular and 
leadership activities. We are very pleased 
with these recipients and the level at 
which theyve achieved, Hampton said.
Interested CMU students had the 
chance to apply for the scholarship last 
October after receiving email about the 
scholarship or seeing an advertising flyer 
posted around campus. Students could 
then self-nominate, like Singhal, or 
apply at the encouragement of others, 
like Dennis.
I had been strongly encouraged to 
apply for the scholarship by the Assis
tant Dean of MCS, Dr. Eric Grotzinger, 
as well as by my advisor, Dr. Sara 
Majetich, said Dennis. After the appli
cations are completed, a CMU selection 
committee reviews the applications and 
decides on three students to send for 
consideration by Intel.
We usually get about triple the 
amount of students [who] we think are 
absolutely fabulous, said Barbara

Trustees approve Building D addition
high bay area  space that isBy RYAN D. SCHILLING
Tartan Assistant News Editor
For years, Carnegie Mellons 
School of Computer Science (SCS) 
has been the orphan of the Uni
versity  a school without abuilding to call its own. The Board of 
Trustees addressed this problem 
on February 9 when it approved a 
$20 million, 107,000 square-foot 
construction project.
The project, whose cost is in
cluded in the Unversitys capital 
projects budget, will add two sto
ries to Building D and the Field 
and Mobile Robotics Center while 
renovating the existing struc
tures. Additionally, the buildings 
will be joined by a sky-lit, twostory atrium. The atrium will be 
a common area for the campus 
and will contain seating, a dining 
services vendor, and an elevator. 
Underneath the atrium will be a
needed in order to use large ma
chinery  for the Field and Ro
botics Center.
The design phase of the project 
will be completed this month, 
and construction will begin in 
June. Weve been working on 
evaluating the space require
ments and designing the build
ing for close to a year now, said 
Jeff Bolton, vice president of 
Planning and Budgets.
Construction will be in two 
phases. In the first phase, sched
uled to end on September 1,1999, 
the new portions of the building 
will be completed, including the 
atrium complex and an enclosed 
walkway connecting the struc
ture to the fourth floor of Wean 
Hall. In Phase .Two, existing 
structures will be renovated and 
the buildings will receive new 
window treatments and a facade.
It will look sort of strange for a 
while, said James Secosky, 
project manager of Facilities 
Planning and Construction, re
ferring to the year that the top 
part of the building will be, com
pleted and the bottom half will 
still have its current facade. But 
once Phase Two is completed, the 
new building will share the yel
low brick and green roof of Ham
burg and Smith halls.
The other advantage from the 
campuss perspective is that a 
fair number of students have 
classes in the Mellon Institute, 
and this will be a good pedes
trian circulation from the north 
side of the campus, said Bolton. 
The main entrance to the build
ing will face Smith Hall, and a 
50-foot walkway will connect the 
new building with the Smith 
Hall parking lot. With this walk
way and the enclosed walkway
which will stretch from Build
ing D to Wean, students will 
have a more direct route to the 
west end of campus.
Aside from the obvious space 
advantages, the new building will 
fulfill a desire to unify SCS in a 
central building. The major 
thrust ofthis building was to help 
them eliminate the fragmenta
tion that currently exists within 
their own school, said Bolton. 
Currently, [SCS is] fragmented 
across eight separate buildings, 
and they felt that this was caus* 
ing some reduction in collabora
tion across the units. With the 
addition of the building, therell 
be a lot tighter interaction be
tween the units.
Construction will create new 
homes for many CS-affiliated de
partments. The new floors of 
BuildingD will house departments

Senate amends 
financial policy
Juggling more than the usual load...
Members of the CMU Juggling Club spent an evening practicing their skills under a rare blue sky last week.
By JAYA SAXENA
Tartan Staffwriter
Last weeks three-hour Stu
dent Senate meeting was domi
nated by extensive discussion 
about funding Greek organiza
tions. Senate agreed to form a 
committee that will investigate 
whether or not exclusive orga
nizations, such as fraternities 
and sororities, should receive 
funding from the University. 
In addition, Senate approved a 
variety of changes to the fiscal 
policy that will impact how all 
campus organizations are 
funded and methods of reim
bursement for these groups.
The Student Senate agreed 
to form the Commission on Ex
clusive Organizations (CEO) 
after lengthy debate about 
whether or not fraternities and 
sororities should be given fund
ing even though they are selec
tive about their membership. 
In this case, different rules 
would apply to them than are 
applied to other exclusive orga
nizations. Senate will ulti
mately approve or reject the 
commissions recommendation.
Student body president and 
senior ECE and engineering 
and public policy double major 
Bryon Krug hopes this process 
is completed in a month, but a 
firm deadline cannot be set due 
to the numerous issues in need 
of closer examination.
Senator Drew Stovall origi
nally proposed the amendment 
that provided Greek organiza
tions with a set subsidy for use 
in booth and buggy construc
tion and/or maintenance. 
Stovall, a junior physics ma
jor, was prompted to issue this 
proposal out of a concern that 
the Greek community was not 
receiving all the benefits of 
their student Activities Fee 
that they deserve.
At the meeting, Stovall 
presented a petition of over 
430 signatures of those sup
porting funding for the Greeks.
Brian Smith/Tartan Sports Co-Editor 
Bryon Krug examines proposed 
changes to the fiscal policy.
I thought a lot of senators 
were focusing on the Greek or
ganizations being exclusive 
while totally ignoring a peti
tion with over 430 signatures 
on it saying that Greeks should 
get money. Exclusivity should 
riot be the issue, said student 
body treasurer and junior busi
ness administration major 
Avinash Jain.
Many Greeks are active in 
campus organizations, but for 
the most part, their primary 
interest lies in an organization 
that Student Senate refuses to 
fund, Stovall said. This pro
posal allows money to be given 
to Greek organizations for the 
specific purpose of benefiting 
the campus and surrounding 
community during Spring Car
nival, an event made possible 
through Greek participation.
However, Stovall withdrew 
his proposal after last 
Thursdays Senate meeting. 
Senate members agreed that 
certain implications of the 
amendment had been over
looked, such as the lack of clar
ity about whether or not any 
CMU student can participate 
on any buggy team although 
Carnival and Sweepstakes 
rules limit participation to 
members of the organizations. 
In addition, Stovall said a ma
jor objection to the proposal

raises
With a new tuition increase 
authorized at last Mondays 
Board of Trustees meeting, stu
dents enrolled at Carnegie 
Mellon for the 1998-1999 school 
year will have to cough up an 
extra $1,270 for their validation 
stickers, Andrew accounts, and 
course registrations.
The increase, which at 4.9 per
cent is almost twice the 1997 rate 
of inflation, will cover both infla
tion and added costs that the Uni
versity is incurring as it increases 
the number of services and pro
grams available to students.
Students come here and they 
want the best. And so we try to 
give them the best in terms of 
facilities as well as educational 
programs and faculty, said Pro
vost Paul Christiano. Theres 
almost no limit to what students 
and families and other interested 
parties want.
In addition to costs that come 
with improving academic pro
grams on campus  such as last 
years addition of Human Com
puter Interaction and Japanese 
majors  the Universitys operat
ing costs will continue to increase 
as it completes current campus 
construction projects. Although tu
ition dollars are not used to pay 
for projects like the University 
Center, Roberts Hall, or the newlyapproved BuildingD renovations, 
the completed proj ects have higher 
maintainence costs than older 
buildings  and tuition monies 
pay for facilities upkeep.
The issue is trying to provide
better quality for the price that 
students are paying, said Jeff 
Bolton, vice president for Plan
ning and Budgets. I think the 
investments we make try to in
crease that value at a faster pace 
than the cost.
Administrators stressed the 
fact that their biggest priority is 
continuing to increase the qual
ity of education that CMU offers 
its students.
William Holtz/Tartan Production Manager
I think if you look at what has 
happened to this University over 
the last decade  the lastfive5 
years  despite the increase in 
cost, youd say that it has at
tracted a better student body 
over that period of time and cre
ated a much better undergradu
ate experience. So thats the ra
tionale, said Christiano.
Many students, however, face

Valentines Day apathy 
runs high for students
- BOSTON (AP)  Put this on one of 
those candy hearts: Cant buy love.
' Or Romance is cheesy. Or maybe Id 
' rather study.
Whats with the sour thoughts on 
^Valentines Day?
' According to a new survey, college 
students consider Valentines Day 
overly commercialized and even less 
romantic than any other day. 
Idealistic young people reject the 
'commercialism, the materialism, 
r and theyre staking a claim and saying,
: ;No, I dont want to buy into that,  said 
: "Nancy McLaren, a professor at the Boston University School of Eductation,
' -which conducted the research.
The survey of 250 Boston Univer
sity students found that nearly 
-half of men and 65 percent of 
: women think students in general now 
-are less romantic than in earlier 
^'generations, though most of the re
spondents described themselves as 
'--romantic. The margin of error was 
not computed.
 : This reflects clearly the ambiva
lence of students at this transitional
 stage of their lives, McLaren said.
On the one hand, she said, there 
'iis the universal need for love and 
emotional intimacy. But young people 
realize it may be wiser to focus 
j von education for now and put off a
- committed relationship.
Take Brian Sullivan, a Boston UniV versity sophomore majoring in ac
counting. He had forgotten last Satur- day was Valentines Day and said hell 
probably spend it in the libraiy.
If Im lucky, Ill get a few hours of 
studying in, he said.
' Or Adriane Stebbins, a sophomore
- at the Massachusetts Institute ofTechnology, who plans to curl up with a
:good textbook. She said theres not 
much time for romance in college.
You get finished with your classes, 
and youre just beat, she said.
Of those students who said they 
would mark Valentines Day this year 
in some way, many said they planned 
to give handmade cards, poems, homecooked dinners, and baked goods as 
gifts, rather than store-bought candy, 
jewelry, and flowers.
I dont think romance is dead. Its 
just more creative than it used to be, 
said Karen Hennessy, a Tufts Univer
sity senior.
Its an excuse for me to make heartshaped cookies with pink icing, and I 
normally hate the color pink, added 
her classmate, Nora Lee.
Others, however, rejected the holi
day outright. Its commercialized, 
expensive, and its just a waste of flow
ers and chocolate, said Melanie Wil
son, a Tufts freshman.
You dont need one specific day to 
show how much you care about some
body. If you really love or care about 
someone, every day should be 
Valentines Day, said Tufts senior 
Pranjul Srivastava.
Jessica Milbergs last "big Valentines 
Day was in the fourth grade, when a 
secret admirer gave her flowers.
Theyre still friends, she said, but 
she hasnt had a particularly romantic 
Valentines Day since. Valentines 
Day is overrated. Whats the big deal? 
said Milberg, a freshman at Boston 
University who planned to go out on 
the town with her girlfriends Satur
day. No one ever had a good 
Valentines Day.
Such attitudes are particularly alien 
to Francois le Sellier, an MIT exchange 
student from France.
Here the girls all say they have a lot 
of homework. It would take two weeks 
to get a date with them, he said. Im 
French. This is ridiculous.
Hubble catches 
stellar fireworks
WASHINGTON (AP) - A supernova 
that dimmed after it was first sighted 11 
years ago appears to be brightening again 
as the blast wave from its explosions 
smashes into a halo of gas and creates a 
ring of fire.
Energy from the explosion of Super
nova 1987A is heating one part of the 
gas ring to millions of degrees, causing a 
glow easily detected by the Hubble Space 
Telescope, astronomers said Tuesday.
This is the first spark of some stellar 
fireworks that will take place over the 
next few years, said Robert P. Kirshner, 
a Harvard astronomer.
Supernova 1987A, the brightest ex
ploding star seen from Earth since 1604, 
was first detected on February 23,1987. 
Though the explosion unleashed a mas
sive display of violent energy, it poses no 
threat to the Earth. The star is in the 
Large Magellanic Cloud, a small galaxy 
of stars 167,000 light-years from the 
Earth. It is visible only from the South
ern Hemisphere.
Astronomers believe the star was a 
red supergiant, 20 times the mass of the 
sun, that reached the end of its lifetime 
and exploded, heating instantly to 10 
billion degrees.
High-speed particles, called neutrinos, 
raced out from the explosion and lit a 
disk of gas thought to have earlier formed 
a ring 100 billion miles around the star.
The glow from the explosion faded 
slowly, but a shock wave of energy, 
moving at about 40 million miles an 
hour, is seen as smashing into the ring 
of gas. The violence of the collision 
heats the gas to millions of degrees 
and sets it aglow.
By following each step of the violent 
process, astronomers say they hope to 
learn more about the final stages of 
stellar evolution. We get to be wit
nesses to an event that promises to tell 
us a lot about the death throes of a 
star, said Kirshner.
Richard McCray, an astronomer at 
the University of Colorado, Boulder,
said that what became Supernova 
1987A probably evolved from a twinstar system that merged into a single 
object. The merger process caused the 
formation of the invisible ring of gas 
that is now lit by the shock wave of the 
explosion, he said.
The ring is putting on a display the 
likes of which have not been seen for 
centuries, said McCray.
Anne L. Kinney of the Space Telescope 
Institute said astronomers are fascinated 
by the inner workings of a supernova 
because it is believed that such explo
sions helped create and distribute all 
the heavy elements.
Early in the universe, she said, there 
were only hydrogen and helium, the 
elements that burn in the nuclear fu
sion fires of stars. As a star burns and 
evolves, it creates heavier elements, 
such as iron, oxygen, and carbon, that 
are essential to life. When a large star 
burns all its hydrogen and helium, 
it can collapse and explode into 
a supernova that spews out the 
heavy elements.
Supernovae fertilize the galaxies with 
this enriched material, said Kinney.
Newspapers cut 
political cartoon
KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) - At least 
four newspapers have refused to run 
Doonesbury cartoons about accusations 
that President Clinton had sex with a 
White House intern.
Cartoonist Garry Trudeaus series 
shows a scandal facilitator talking with 
an elementary school class about the sex 
allegations.
It uses such phrases as oral sex and 
semen-streaked dress.
We didnt run it because I thought the 
language was offensive and inappropri
ate for the comics page, said Robert C. 
Gabordi, executive editor of The HeraldDispatch of Huntington, W.Va.
At least three other newspapers also 
refused to run the strip Monday or Tues
day  The Charleston (W.Va.) Daily 
Mail, The Charlotte (N.C.) Observer, and 
The Valley News of Lebanon, N.H.
The Daily Mail ran Mondays strip but 
decided against Tuesdays, said Nanya 
Friend, the managing editor. The big 
factor is that the comics page is read by 
a lot of kids. I think the story line is good. 
Its funny. Well probably run the rest of 
it, she said.
More than a dozen newspapers called 
Doonesbury publisher Universal Press 
Syndicate to question it. Some moved it 
from their comics to their editorial pages; 
others replaced it.
Individual newspapers dont have to 
notify the syndicate when they pull a 
comic, so it would be impossible to know 
how many of about 1,400 susbscribers 
ran the series, Universal Press Syndi
cate spokesman Lee Salem said.
This isnt the first time Trudeaus work 
has been pulled from the funny pages, 
and it probably wont be the last, Salem 
said. aDoonesbury has always been a 
very edgy strip that takes a hard look 
at the political and social world we live 
in, he said.
The Observer dropped an earlier 
Doonesbury series involving allegations 
that then-Vice President Dan Quayle 
had used marijuana in the 1970s. For 
the Clinton series, the newspaper of
fered to fax or mail copies of the comics 
to anyone who wanted them.
Politics makes for 
odd schoolmates
WASHINGTON (AP) - While Ken
neth Starr investigates President 
Clinton, his daughter is preparing to 
become Chelseas schoolmate.
Carolyn Starr, a senior at the private 
Potomac School in McLean, Va., has 
accepted early admission to Stanford 
University, The Washington Post re
ported Wednesday. Chelsea Clinton en
rolled at Stanford last fall.
Starr plans to focus on Japanese stud
ies and English, the newspaper said.
Stanford had no comment.
Starr also applied to Pepperdine Uni
versity in Malibu, Calif., where her fa
ther has postponed acceptance of the 
law school deanship to complete the 
Whitewater investigation.Clinton warns public about casualties in possible Iraq conflict
WASHINGTON (AP) - Still 
lacking a congressional endorse
ment of its Iraq policy, the Clinton 
administration is taking its case 
clirectly to the public with warn' ings about Iraqi aggression and 
caution about U.S. casualties.
After spending the holiday
 weekend at Camp David, Md., 
"President Clinton will go to the 
Pentagon on Tuesday for a brief
ing by the Joint Chiefs of Staff 
iand then address the nation from 
v .there, said a senior administration official, speaking on condi
tion of anonymity.
S 'Clinton also will send Secrevtary of State Madeleine Albright 
^and other senior members of his 
'.national security team to Ohio 
.State University next week to 
rally support for his stand against 
.Iraq, officials said Friday.
With little sign of a break
through on the diplomatic front,
Clinton said Friday, I hope and I 
pray that Iraqi President Saddam 
Hussein gives up his resistance to 
U.N. weapons inspections.
Otherwise, he said, a U.S.-led 
military operation will signifi
cantly diminish Iraqs ability to 
regenerate the arsenal of dooms
day weapons it was developing 
before the 1991 Persian Gulf War.
A day after Russias defense 
minister publicly rebuked 
the United States for threaten
ing Iraq, the president said 
he respects Moscows view 
but added, uNyet is not no 
for the United States under 
these circumstances.
Meanwhile Friday, Iraqs 
deputy foreign minister, Riyadh 
al-Qaysi, accused the administra
tion of fabricating charges against 
Iraq and of itching for a fight.
We are a nation that wants 
peace, al-Qaysi said in deliver
ing a point-by-point rebuttal to 
a speech Friday by Sandy 
Berger, Clintons national secu
rity adviser. Berger accused Iraq 
of lies, deceit, and runarounds 
in seeking to defy U.N. inspec
tions that are designed to verify 
that all Iraqi nuclear, chemical, 
and biological weapons have 
been destroyed.
Al-Qaysi said all such weapons 
are gone and that Washington 
can show no evidence to the con
trary. This [U.S.] campaign is 
being conducted on the basis of 
lies and deception and should not 
be taken by anyone in the world 
as being a justifiable basis for 
war, al-Qaysi said.
Bergers speech at Washingtons 
National Press Club was designed 
in part to prepare the American 
public for the possibility of the 
biggest bombing campaign against 
Iraq since the Gulf War.
No military mission is without 
risk or cost, Berger said. Even 
the best-prepared and bestequipped forces will suffer losses. 
In a similar vein, Army Gen
eral Henry Shelton, chairman of 
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told re
porters Friday that if Clinton or
ders a military strike, Well lose 
some people, no question. 
Bergers speech drew Republi
can criticism on Capitol Hill. Sen. 
Dan Coats (R-Ind.), called it 
pretty tepid and lacking a for
mula for victory over Saddam.
In the end, Saddam Hussein is 
going to be standing there smiling 
with cheering throngs hero to 
his people  for once again stand
ing up to the United States, Coats 
said. Our goal must be to depose 
Saddam Hussein.
Shelton said he doubted an air 
campaign would trigger an inter
nal revolt against Saddam.
He has a pretty tight control 
over his military, Shelton said.
He has large portions of his 
military that are very support
ive of the regime, and so I think 
well see that they will continue 
to support it.
Berger asserted that the United 
States is drawing increasing sup
port from friends and allies for its 
tough stance against Iraq. He 
named 11 countries, including 
Britain, Germany, Hungary, and 
Poland, as prepared to provide 
forces, bases, or logistical sup
port for an attack.
He conceded, however, that in 
the U.N. Security Council there 
is too little support for the U.S. 
position to seek a resolution au
thorizing the use of force. He re
iterated Clintons view that pre
vious U.N. Security Council reso
lutions provide all the legal au
thority necessary for a strike.
On the domestic front, the ad
ministration also is struggling to 
gain support.
Congress began a one-week re
cess without voting on a nonbind
ing resolution endorsing a U.S. 
military strike against Iraq. Some 
lawmakers of both parties are 
hesitant because they fear the 
conflict could spin out of control, 
because some are hearing from 
constituents who oppose military 
action and because they question 
whether the strikes will cause 
Iraq to yield.
A letter to Clinton signed by all 
seven active American cardinals 
stated, We write ... to urge that 
instead of using the military op
tion, you reinforce the diplomatic 
initiatives by widening the par
ticipation of other governments, 
especially Arab states, in the con
certed effort to bring about Iraqi 
compliance on these issues.

 James M. Bovard was named 
President of Carnegie Institute 
and Chairman of the Board of 
Trustees of Carnegie Tech. 
Bovard, a graduate of Yale Uni
versity and the University of 
Pittsburgh law school, was an 
attorney in Pittsburgh prior to 
the appointment.
In World War II, he served as 
a lieutenant colonel. He was se
lected to replace the deceased 
William Frew, who likewise at
tended Yale and the University 
of Pittsburgh. Frews father was 
the first president of the 
Carnegie Institute in 1886.
25 YEARS AGO, February 13, 
1973  Dr. Angel Jordan was 
chosen as the first U. A. and Helen 
Whitaker Professor of Electron
ics and Electrical Engineering. 
President Richard Cyert an
nounced that the position was 
made possible by the recent 
$750,000 grant from alumnus 
U.A. Whitaker. Whitaker gradu
ated in 1929 and was the presi
dent, treasurer, and director of 
Aircraft-Marine Products, Inc. 
Jordan is currently affiliated with 
the Robotics Institute.
TEN YEARS AGO, February 
9,1988  Carlos Gomez, a Nica
raguan national and engineer
ing professor at Lehigh Univer
sity, spoke at a College Republi
cans lecture in favor of the Con
tra guerrillas fighting the 
Sandinista government in Nica
ragua. Originally, the event was 
supposed to feature Joseph Dou
glas, the Creole founder of the 
Contra army, but Gomez, who 
had lived a few years under the 
Sandinista government, was 
called in to substitute when
Douglas schedule conflicted. 
The fiery student audience chal
lenged Gomezs supposed impar
tiality, and even accused him of 
working for the CIA.
To support the Contras in their 
war against the Nicaraguan gov
ernment, a few high ranking U.S. 
government officials, including 
Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North, 
secretly sold weapons to Iran and 
then funneled the profits to the 
guerrillas, in what is now known 
as the Iran-Contra Affair.
FIVE YEARS AGO, Febru
ary 17,1992  Hackers working 
from the Netherlands broke into 
the Civil Engineering computer 
systems. The assailants infil
trated with a trojan horse pro
gram, knocking out a civil engi
neering senior project and the 
departments email. Fortu
nately, the bandits did not
tamper with the entire 
Universitys network. The FBI 
apprehended the hackers, but 
was unable to determine the mo
tive for the attack.
ONE YEAR AGO, February
17,1997  The Board of Trust
ees approved a 4.5 percent tu
ition increase for the 1997-98 
year, raising the cost of attend
ing Carnegie Mellon from 
$19,400 to $20,275. Room and 
board costs also increased by 2.9 
percent, from $6,040 to $6,215.
Each year the tuition adjusts 
with the change in the cost of 
living index. The Universitys 
rationale was that high quality 
academic programs are of a 
higher priority than keeping tu
ition costs down.

me as a person, extracurricular activi
ties, and things like that  not really 
technical questions, said Singhal.
About two months after the inter
view, Gwendolyne Wood, associate pro
vost for academic projects and the pri
mary CMU contact for the scholar
ship, informed the students that they 
had received the scholarship.
It doesnt mean that we dont think 
the other students were not wonder
ful, said Lazarus. Ten years from 
now, I would like to see 10 times the 
number of scholarships, or even 20.

engineering scholarships. CMU has 
three graduate fellowship winners  
doctoral candidates Corey Kosak (CS) 
and Grace McNalley (ECE) and mas

Sandra Rocco, associate director of the 
Robotics Institute. Im telling almost 
everyone in the institute to be prepared 
to move.
The other thing thats important with 
this building addition is that it really 
begins to address the master plan down 
in that area of campus, in terms of 
eventually coming up with some green 
space, said Bolton. Its a key building 
in the development of that site. Right 
now its very industrial looking, so this 
is a good long-term investment from 
the Universitys perspective.

was that fraternities and sororities are 
exclusive organizations and Senate is 
not allowed to fund organizations that 
discriminate based on race, religion, 
sexual orientation, and gender.
When the issue first came up among 
Senate members, the group was very 
divided, said Krug. Some saw it as a 
real philosophical issue, but by the 
time [Stovall] withdrew it, the room was 
not that divided. I think almost every
one agreed that the pro____________
posed amendment was 
well intended but it 
wouldnt have been the 
best thing for Student Sen
ate to approve it as it cur
rently was.
If this amendment was 
inserted as such, there
would have been a num_____________
ber of disagreeable side 
effects, said Stovall. Basically, the cur
rent constitution is not set up to handle 
this change, without massive revisions. 
It was my hope that these revisions 
could be made after Senate accepted the 
idea of directing funds to the Greeks. 
Rather, these wording problems became 
the central issue. It is my hope that the 
presidential commission will be able to 
propose the necessary changes in such a 
manner that the issue can be debated, 
rather than the grammar, he said.
Krug is in the process of selecting 
Senators, Greek members, honor soci
ety members, students across campus, 
and Graduate Student Assembly (GSA) 
representatives to serve on the CEO. 
The group will be comprised of no more 
than 10 individuals.
The goal is to develop a well-thoughtout recommendation as quickly as [the 
group] can, but not to rush to a solution 
that isnt fully thought-out, Krug said.
The group has a difficult.task. I doubt
it will be able to please everybody, but 
I will do everything I can to ensure the 
recommendations it makes are best to 
the student body at CMU as a whole, 
he said.
Senate also approved various changes 
to the fiscal policy, marking the first 
time the restructured student govern
ment, including undergraduate and 
graduate students, has worked together 
on budgeting. Two of the most signifi
cant changes made to the fiscal policy
The goal was to make a robust 
policy that would be easy to use by 
the student organizations."
 Bill Slye, former GSA President
amendment are greater flexibility in 
funding certain items such as coaching 
expenses and leasing off-campus facili
ties and clarification of the approval 
process for organizations. Other 
changes include altering wording within 
the document and making certain 
points clearer.
The old fiscal policy lists certain items 
for which organizations could not previ
ously receive funding, such as renting 
off-campus facilities. However, the new 
policy recognizes the fact that some
times organizations have legitimate rea
sons for requesting funding for some of 
these things. It allows for greater flex
ibility that will make it easier for orga
nizations to seek funding for the justi
fied use of many such items.
The Joint Funding Committee, a presi
dential commission, could approve such 
special allocations with a two-thirds vote 
that would be followed by the approval 
or rejection by GSA and Senate.
The goal was to make a robust policy 
that would be easy to use by the studetit 
organizations but effectively prevent 
misuse of Student Activity funds j>y 
individuals, said Bill Slye, past presi
dent of GSA and chair of the presiden
tial commission.
According to Krug, the old fiscal polity 
amendment was too stringent and did 
not allow for the flexibility that was 
needed to deal with the large number of 
campus organizations.
---------------- The new policy also clari
fies the fact that the Stu
dent Activities account di
rector should approve ail 
of an organizations ex
penditures in advance in 
order to ensure reim
bursement. It also stipu
lates that approval is not 
BHHHHHSgj required if an organiza
tion wants to spend less 
than $50 for a legitimate purpose. !
Last November, Krug formed a 
special committee to review the old 
policy. The goals of the committee were 
to evaluate the policy and ensure that 
the purposes of Activities Fee are being 
met, to make sure that funds are 
allocated fairly and efficiently t!o 
students and student organizations, to 
provide guidelines for how money should 
be spent or allocated, and to prevent 
the abuse of the Activities Fee 
money. The 15-member commission 
includes Senators, GSA representa
tives, and leaders of campus 
organizations.
Grant Bromhal, president of GSA, said 
that the changes not only make th!e 
fiscal policy clearer but also conform the 
policy to what really goes on.
I think [the changes] do benefit the 
community. [They] open a little wider 
the range of things students can appy 
for, he said.

more difficulties in covering the cost of 
a tuition increase than simply writing a 
larger check. For a lot of people, choos
ing a college is a financial decision, 
said Fiona Tranquida, sophomore En
glish major. [The administration] is 
going to be excluding a lot of valuable 
and talented students if they keep in-. 
creasing costs without increasing the 
financial aid thats available  schol
arships especially.
Bill Elliott, vice president of Enroll
ment, said that the CMU administra
tion will continue to provide students
with enough financial aid to allow them 
to continue their studies here. Addition
ally, administrators note that CMUs 
tuition and tuition increase are still lower 
than those of many other comprable 
schools. For example, Washington Uni
versity in St. Louis, whose tuition is 
currently higher than CMUs, is raising 
its tuition by 5.6 percent.
I can make it possible for young people 
to come here, said Elliott. I cant neces
sarily make it easy. Theres going to be 
sacrifices along the way; its going to be 
painful for families, because quite frankly, 
were talking about a significant invest
ment of time and resources. But Id also 
argue that the reward from the degree 
coming out of this institution makes it 
one of the best investments possible. 
Elliott also said that top students will 
always find a way to afford top schools 
and that students and parents are swayed 
more by the quality of education a school 
offers than by its costs.
Some students, however, disagree. 
Choosing a college is not a financial 
decision? asked Nathaniel Manisfca, 
freshman physics major. You knoW, I 
acted that way and then I couldnt afford

Greek organizations 
should not get funding
Student Senate has recently 
repened discussion about allo
cating funding for Greek organi
zations booth and sweepstakes 
activities. In the past, fraterni
ties and sororities have been de
nied any type of financial assis
tance. The current discussion 
mi^st also end in the same mannet  Student Senate should not 
provide funding for Greek organi
zations participation in booth 
and buggy.
Fraternities and sororities do 
not accept every student who 
comes knocking at their doors. 
Fof this reason alone, Senate 
should deny them funding from 
Activities Fee  a financial re
source allocated to organizations 
that do not discriminate against 
anjy CMU student. If a student is 
not welcome at the fraternity of 
th^ir choice, that student 
shouldnt have to contribute to 
th^t fraternitys funding.
Many fraternities are facing fi
nancial difficulty. However, all 
members of the Greek commu
nity pay dues to participate in the 
activities of their houses. Perhaps 
th fraternities and sororities 
should raise their dues or budget 
more effectively to allow for a 
heftier cash reserve for Carnival 
activities. The recent increase in 
th Activities Fee barely covers 
the current Senate-recognized 
ar(d funded organizations; it 
would be wrong to spread this 
financial source even thinner before meeting the needs of cur
rently-funded organizations.
Greek organizations dont need 
money simply to build buggies 
and booths; they want more cash 
to bankroll their state-of-the-art 
enhancements. These modifica
tions continue to push the com
petitiveness of Carnival past a 
reasonable level. Plus, if Greeks 
choose not to participate in either 
Booth or Buggy, Carnival will go 
on without them. Recent years 
have seen strong independent 
competitors such as SPIRIT and 
KSA challenge the fraternities 
and sororities in both Booth 
and Sweepstakes.
Fraternities and sororities want 
to be subsidized for Carnival com
petitions, but they dont need it and 
they dont deserve it. If Greek orga
nizations receive financial support 
for their participation in this area, 
it is likely that they will want more 
money in the future. Funding Greek 
organizations is a dangerous pre
cedent that Senate cannot estab
lish while still being fair to the 
whole student population.
The newly-formed Commission 
on Exclusive Organizations 
should consider this subject care
fully and contact constituents 
for opinions. The entire student 
body entrusts Senate to allocate 
their Activities Fee properly  
that means not turning over 
money to any organization in 
which all students are not allowed 
to participate.
University must foster 
external awareness
Expanding international activi
ties and leveraging existing glo
bal interests are outlined as part 
of fcMUs current Strategic Plan
ning Process  an integral ele
ment of the Universitys mission 
statement. While this expansion 
prbves that the University un
derstands the need to focus on 
issues outside the perimeter of 
out campus community, the ef
fort to increase undergraduate 
national and international 
awareness is lacking. It is not 
th0 administrations responsibil
ity to police the habits of stu
dents, but it is its responsibility 
to encourage knowledge and 
growth on more than purely 
academic levels.
CMU has an insular culture 
which makes it difficult for 
students to keep track of the 
world around them. The adminis
tration should take more steps 
to make this easier, and students 
should make more of an effort 
to avoid letting schoolwork 
be; the only component of their 
education.
Students here tend to immerse 
themselves in scholastics which 
isolates them from real-world 
events. Some resources are cur
rently available for those who are 
motivated to keep themselves in
formed, including inexpensive 
student subscriptions to respected 
newspapers such as The New York 
Titnes and cable news networks 
such as CNN.
But the University community 
doesnt foster an atmosphere in 
which the value of such knowl
edge is emphasized. Some faculty 
members are very adept at incor
porating current events into the 
classroom setting. If more faculty 
would try to achieve the same 
balance in the classroom, apa
thetic students would be more 
likely to stay in touch with events 
happening off campus. If students 
choose to continue to ignore the 
relevance of current global events 
in their lives, thats their 
mistake. Making Carnegie Mellon 
an all-around educational insti
tution is a two-way street, and 
students cant afford to ignore 
oncoming traffic.
Besides the existing outlets, the 
University administration can 
take other steps to help break the 
academic bubble in which stu
dents live. Making news chan
nels more visible around campus 
would increase student awareness 
as would placing newspapers in 
various buildings other than 
the library.
The goal of a college education is 
to create human beings ready to 
take their place as citizens of their 
nation and the world. If the Uni
versity doesnt do more to facili
tate awareness of current events 
and the student body doesnt do 
more to pay attention to such ef
forts, the full potential of Carnegie 
Mellon as an educational institu
tion will never be realized.

Letters to the Editor
Column Ignores 
other minorities
Editor:
Its hard to detect a 
problem if the prob
lem doesnt affect you. 
These words came to 
mind as I read 
Michelle Hans article 
(CMU Community 
Sees No Color, 2/9/98). In this article, 
Han suggests that at CMU almost ev
ery other face you see is the face of a 
minority and that within the campus 
the issue of race all but disappears. I 
find it ironic that Hans article reveals 
just how important the issues of ethnicity 
are and how they go ignored all too often.
What Han sees on the CMU campus is
Letter to 
the Editor
a very large and strong Asian commu
nity  so large that no other minority 
group comes close to having the same 
number of ethnically-oriented student 
organizations on campus. I agree with 
Han that it is a welcoming sight to have 
so many Asian students on campus. But 
welcoming for whom? What of the black 
students on campus? Or the Latino stu
dents? Or the Native Americans?
Looking at the number of students 
from these other minority groups, its 
obvious that CMU is far from being 
color-blind. In the Mechanical Engineer
ing Graduate Department, there are all 
of two black students. Both men. At the 
undergraduate level, there are a shame
ful few as well. And this trend is popular 
across the campus.
It is also important to note that a large 
number of the Latino students on cam
pus are not American citizens or even
residents of the US. Most plan to return 
to their countries and work there. This 
suggests that CMU is doing little for the 
U.S.s own communities, which are the 
most important in remedying race rela
tions here.
Minority is a term that encompases 
many people in the United States. Its 
unfair to generalize about minority 
groups when your experience is limited 
to one. We all have our differences in 
thoughts and experience, as well as in 
our present conditions. One groups pros
perity does not imply anothers. I would 
suggest that Han and others like her 
look more carefully into the situation in 
CMU and elsewhere and try to see some
thing from another persons viewpoint.

Wall of difference separates students
Bhumika Muchhala
Diversity on this campus is 
widespread. And Im not talk
ing about just ethnic diver
sity, Im talking about aca
demic diversity. Im talking 
about the vastly different 
kinds of people one encoun
ters while walking from 
Doherty to CFA to Baker Hall. 
Looking at, experiencing, and 
finally going beyond the great 
wall of CMU that exists be
tween technical and cultural 
literacy is something that most 
students here go through.
The appearances, styles, 
values, and outlooks of people 
on this campus are, to a large 
extent, defined by their col
lege or department affiliation. 
There is nothing wrong with 
this. Or is there? Interactions 
between the different people 
on this campus can lead to a 
variety of things. They can 
lead to frustration and preju
dice, they can lead to new 
knowledge and understand
ing, or they can have no effect 
and lead to indifference.
The background drone of 
conversations and the semibright sun surround me as I 
walk towards Doherty. I see 
two boys standing near The 
Cut, seemingly wrapped in 
conversation, their bulky 
Jansports glued to their backs, 
their white sneakers, glasses, 
and short hair in harmonious 
existence with each other. I 
take a left and walk towards 
CFA. Nestled in the alcoves 
that line the front of the build
ing, a group of four smoke ciga
rettes, laugh, blow smoke, and 
talk loudly. One has on baggyenough-to-fit-five-of-her jeans 
with paint smudges, several 
items of jewelry, and silver 
sunglasses propped on the top 
of her head.
Although these descriptions 
are huge generalizations, they
do fit a lot of the people who 
exist on both sides of the wall 
that divides technical and cul
tural mindsets in this school.
To stop and think about the 
extent of the differences be
tween the people who go to 
this school is amazing. We all 
go to the same school, but then 
again, we dont. The system of 
college-cloisters at CMU in
hibits any kind of consistent 
interaction between the two 
sides of the wall. There are 
many people who never tran
scend the wall during their 
four years here. These people 
stay on their grass, their build
ings, their tables, their work,
about topics that are mutual 
between them. In both cases, 
the division remains intact. It 
just helps when youre not sit
ting there alone and looking 
around you for an escape from 
the seclusion that you feel.
An art major and a physics 
major wind up sitting at the 
same table in the coffeehouse 
through a mutual friend. Af
ter being introduced to each 
other and after the initial sur
face talk, the conversation de
velops, and they tell each other 
about the projects and papers 
that they are working on. They 
are both interested in what 
the other is doing. The
their parties, and so on. This 
lack of interaction doesnt benefit them, but at the same time, 
theres no tangible loss.
A history major and two CS 
majors are sitting at a table 
having dinner, and the con
versation is flowing for a while. 
A short silence passes. One 
person asks the other what 
the homework was in their 
advanced CS class. The two 
then start talking about the 
homework, and eventually 
about some of their other 
classes, and so on. The history 
major is left out, knows little 
about what theyre talking 
about, and sits there finishing 
the rest of her food.
If the situation were re
versed, the two history majors 
would have started talking
Alex Smlth/Tartan Junior Staff
postmodern art movement 
fascinates the physics major, 
and the theories of quantum 
physics fascinate the art ma
jor. There is a mutual sense of 
something being gained.
Indifference arises when 
conversation halts before it 
reaches this point. Most surface-level conversations will 
leave little effect on either 
party. The art major and the 
physics major may introduce 
themselves, talk about where 
theyre from, how long theyve 
been in college, and where 
they live in college, but at a 
point not so far away, the sur
face-level conversation dies 
out. Perhaps a friendship will 
eventually develop, but for the 
time being, nobody has gained 
anything new.
Usually, on a social basis, 
people say How are you, 
Hows it going, and Hey, 
you wanna go get some food? 
Most people dont seriously 
discuss academic content and 
ideologies often. The inter
action between an ECE maj or and an English maj or who 
are good friends will not fo
cus around either English or 
engineering. The conversa
tion will focus on their per
sonal and social lives. Here, 
its not an English major and 
an engineering major con
versing  its simply two 
friends talking.
The most idealistic situa
tion is when two different 
kinds of people learn some
thing new from each other. 
This situation encourages dif
ferent ways of thinking, and 
while this may sound like the 
same old sob story to you, its 
importance cant be denied.
While some people are per
fectly content staying in their 
exclusive nests, there are 
people who want inter-college 
interaction that leads 
to different understandings. 
Students have suggested vari
ous ways to increase this level 
of interaction. For example, 
one effective solution would 
be to have more varied inter
disciplinary classes, in which 
students from every college 
could enroll. Valuable and re
freshing interaction could be 
a daily reality.
It would be ideal if students 
from both sides of the wall 
wind up in stimulating con
versations in coffeehouses and 
hallways all the time. But, 
unfortunately, that doesnt 
happen as often as it should. 
If we could just start chipping 
away at the wall, day by day, 
wed be surprised at how 
quickly things could change.

arrows of outrageous foreign policy, it 
appears that our government'has given 
up on finding a political solution before 
weve even tried.
First and foremost, we should be cau
tious precisely because Hussein is unstable. 
We have no idea what he has planned or 
even what hell do next. If we poke him in 
his vulnerable places, we shouldnt be sur
prised if he reacts and, considering the 
weapons in question, that reaction could 
have extremely damaging repercussions. 
It wouldnt be such a bad idea just to take 
him out entirely, but how can we know that 
any leader who emerges from the inevi
table ensuing chaos would be any better? 
Indeed, given the prevalent Iraqi attitude 
towards Americans, an assassination may 
only turn them further against diplomatic 
reconcilliation. The best way to handle 
Hussein is to back off and find a peaceful 
way to resolve the situation. Inaction may 
be frustrating, but its far less likely to do 
permanent damage.
Second, what good would force do? By 
all expert estimations, to be effective in 
taking out the disputed weapons caches 
(which, after all, would be our focus, since 
their existence is what we object to in the 
first place), wed have to expend far more 
resources and troops than it would be 
worth. These sites contain large stock
piles of deadly weapons that belong to a 
paranoid and militaristic government. 
Theyre bound to be heavily defended. 
Even if we were willing to use up so many 
resources to get at the goods the likeli
hood of destroying all of the weapons 
caches isnt high. If we cant eliminate 
them, the entire war, and the lives lost in 
it, would be for nothing.
And is the U.S. drawing any conclusions 
from its very limited support from other 
countries for these proposed air strikes? It 
would seem to me that if there were truly no 
alternative to military force, our historical 
allies would be happy to stand behind us. 
Theres nothing to gain by staying out of the 
conflict except perhaps a chance at peace. If 
all those nations think theres still room for 
diplomacy, what, besides our historical an
tagonism with the Middle East, makes the 
United States so different?
Which brings me to my last point: Lets 
not let wounded jingoism and spite cloud 
good judgment. It seems like a lot of Ameri
cans are personally offended by the Iraqi 
governments portrayal of the United 
States as the Great Satan and want to 
hit back. But dictatorial regimes need 
some enemy to keep peoples minds off the 
repression at home.
Who better to pick on 
than the United 
States, a country that 
is bigger and richer 
than Iraq and has very 
little cultural connec
tion with it? Its really 
rather childish and, as 
such, I can hardly take 
it seriously, much less 
be offended by it. Weve 
been humiliating Iraq 
for almost a decade 
with crippling trade 
sanctions  the root of 
a lot of this bad feel
ing. Humiliating the Iraqis further in re
taliation for villianizing us may give us 
satisfaction, but would it be worth it?
This is a global issue; the fates of many 
nations and millions of people will feel the 
impact of the decisions made in our coun
try. Indeed, if it comes to warfare, our very 
planet could be affected. Its absolutely 
essential, when the stakes are this high, 
that we make decisions based on rational
ity and careful consideration  not pride, 
machismo, or financial expediency. Disre
gard that and we may well end up playing 
a sort of game of global Clue, where 
Saddam Hussein is the only suspect  
Saddam did it in London with the Deadly 
Nerve Gas; Saddam did it in Los Angeles 
with the Nuclear Warhead. I dont think 
that sounds like much fun.

The United States has a great tradi
tion of pussyfooting around. And thats 
what were doing right now in Iraq. While 
were sitting there like a kitten ready to 
pounce, Saddam is dangling a sausage in 
front of our face. Weve got to show him 
whos boss. Weve got to stop giving him 
leeway and time to stockpile. Weve got to 
send someone in there to kill him.
This isnt the first time the U.S. has 
made threats that just werent very 
threatening. For example, the CIA re
cently de-classified 1,500 pages of 
documents, some of which relate to Op
eration Mongoose, the code name for 
the Kennedy 
administrations 
plan to rub out Fidel 
Castro. But as these 
documents reveal, 
rubbing the guy out 
was not Priority 
One. A memo en
titled Possible Ac
tions to Provoke, 
Harass, or Disrupt 
Cuba suggests sev
eral tactics, includ
ing Operation Free 
Ride. Objective: To 
create unrest and 
dissension amongst 
the Cuban people. Concept: Air-drop valid 
Pan American or KLM one-way airline 
tickets good for passage to Mexico City, 
Caracas, etc. (None to the U.S.) Tickets 
could be intermixed with other leaflets. 
Heres a better one: Operation Good 
Times. Objective: To disillusion the Cu
ban population with the Castro image by 
distribution of fake photographic mate
rial. Concept: Prepare a photograph that 
depicts a scene such as an obese Castro 
with two beauties in any situation de
sired.... Make as many prints as desired 
and distribute them over the coun
tryside by airdrops or agents. This 
should put even a Commie director in the 
proper perspective for the underpri
vileged masses.
Operation Mongoose strikes a lot of 
people as something deplorable, a blot on 
the history of the U.S. government. I 
agree, but not because the operation was 
crooked and under-handed  it was 
wimpy. Distribute leaflets? Boring, borMatt Blum/Tartan Junior Staff
ing, boring. The CIA wasnt trying to kill 
Castro; they were trying to get him on 
TVs Bloopers and Practical Jokes.
And here we are in the same situation 
with Saddam Hussein. Only its worse, 
because Hussein is a complete lunatic. 
Castro had nukes, but Hussein has biologi
cal weapons which are much deadlier. They 
say one anthrax bacterium can wipe out 
New York City, which wouldnt be such a 
great loss, but, my God, what if Saddam 
were to attack Los Angeles? Do yourself a 
favor and dont read up on this biological 
stuff  itll keep you awake at night.
We cant afford to sit around imposing 
oil embargos, letting battleships swim 
around in circles in the Persian Gulf, and 
pronouncing his name Sodom. Some
body just kill this guy!
Right now, were not threatening 
Hussein. Were stalking him. And Ive 
never understood the point of stalking. 
Why leave strange messages on someones 
answering machine or send them un
signed letters? Whats the point? If youre 
hot for some guy, just ask him out. Or if 
you want to kill some girl  I confess 
ignorance as to the motives for stalking  
just kill her.
Granted, killing Saddam wont be easy. 
Hes got pretty tight security. And Im not 
for bombing Baghdad just to take him 
out. There are other methods. Send 
Madeleine Albright in there on some dip
lomatic mission. Tell Hussein, Hey, 
Maddy wants to come into Baghdad and 
chat about our plans to remove all U.S. 
military presence from the Middle East. 
Saddam would jump at that. So lil ol 
innocent Madeleine Albright goes to 
Baghdad, has a private meeting with 
Saddam, and tells him, Sure, take Ku
wait, whatever you want, the world is 
your oyster. And when hes not looking, 
she drops a little powder in his drink. Its 
a slow-acting poison, which will give her 
time to escape. By the time shes back in 
Washington, Saddams throat has closed 
up, and hes lying dead in his waterbed.
And what a boon it would be for Clinton! 
What better way to divert attention from 
the Lewinsky thing than by killing this 
countrys favorite foreign bad guy? Enough 
of this Do what we say or well slap you on 
the wrist stuff. Ive never been one for 
beating around the bush. Saddams had 
his chance. Lets do the right thing.

Columnist finds campus courtesy uncommon
Amy Berger
I was about to wash my. hands 
in one of the University Centers 
womens bathrooms when some
thing hit me like a splash of cold 
water on the face. Only the water 
wasnt on my face, it was almost 
all over my backpack.
Fortunately, I was able to keep 
the majority of my bag dry by 
snatching it up at the last pos
sible second from the huge puddle 
lying on the counter. Besides the 
threat of the water, what actu
ally hit me was the complete lack 
of simple courtesy exercised by 
whoever had used the sink before 
me. How long would it have taken
her to use a paper towel to dry the 
counter and show a little respect 
for other women?
Granted, it is only women who 
use that bathroom, but I have 
seen this total disregard for other 
people in action elsewhere. Its 
all too common to get a meal in 
the UC and have to look for a 
while before finding a clean table.
While there are janitors who 
actually get paid to clean up the 
messes that people leave behind, 
it is not asking too much for people 
to take a few seconds to think 
about the student who will have 
to use their table after them. And 
it would only take a few more 
seconds to wipe a napkin across 
the table several times to at least 
ensure that whoever sits there
next wont have to eat among the 
greasy, sticky remains, of some
one elses meal.
Being courteous isnt hard. In 
fact, compared to all the assign
ments and tests that give people 
such a hard time, showing a little 
courtesy is about the easiest thing 
anyone can do to make them
selves and others feel better.
Smiling at someone as they 
walk into a lecture hall for a muchdreaded class can make that per
son feel that, boring as the class 
may be, there is still a tiny amount 
of decency on campus.
Holding doors can do the same 
thing. People carrying heavy 
packages or sports equipment or 
a musical instrument would be 
grateful if someone entering a
building before them were kind 
enough to wait a few seconds to 
hold open the door.
Yes, there may be times when 
respecting the people around you 
would mean going out of your 
way, but thats no excuse for not 
caring. The quiet study area in 
Hunt Library is often less than 
quiet. A place that is reserved for 
people who need to study and 
concentrate without noise is not 
the place to bring cellular 
phones or beepers. Its not the 
place for meeting friends and 
talking loudly about plans for 
the weekend.
Being considerate to others try
ing to get some work done could 
mean going all the way into the 
stairwell to take phone calls or
carry on conversations, but thats 
a small price to pay to give fellow 
students the peace and quiet they 
are entitled to.
It would be nice if there were 
some kind of reward program 
where you could get brownie 
points for showing a little human 
decency, but there isnt. There 
doesnt have to be. The small 
things that take just a few extra 
seconds to do might make 
someones day a little nicer, and 
they in turn will brighten some
one elses.

Military mindset justifies abuse
w"3r~
Yishan Wong
Last week, three students at 
Virginia Military Institute (VMI) 
were handed one-semester sus
pensions for their alleged involve
ment in hazing freshman cadets. 
On multiple occasions over the 
course of about a month, the fresh
men were beaten with belts and 
coat hangers, as part of an initia
tion ritual by their senior men
tors. One cadets parents are de
manding that the incident be 
treated as a criminal case, citing
tional service. There is nothing 
especially wrong with this, but 
we must recognize that the mili
tary possesses this quality so that 
the rest of society doesnt have to.
Between countries, there is no 
recognized law  just agreements 
held in place by force or the threat 
of force. The only actual deter
rent to aggression is the possibil
ity of real or perceived revenge by 
the enemy or its allies. There is 
no legal structure in which na
tions reside, and as such, inter
national use of force is fully sanc
tioned and is declared both legal 
and moral at the whims of the 
actors involved. The militaries of
press and act out primal instincts. 
Cadets at VMI and other mili
tary academies are being trained 
to enter such a life. For any fight
ing force, the stronger the tribal 
and pack instinct, the greater 
the effectiveness.
With United States forces 
proudly touted as the worlds best 
military, such incidents of cadet 
brutality should not be unex
pected. Hazing rituals at our best 
military academies are perfectly 
in line with this fact, as are the 
ever-recurring allegations of 
sexual misconduct. Marine pin
ning rituals  initiation rites 
which involve sticking pins in the 
initiates to test pain toler
ance  also fit this mold.
The pack structure relies 
heavily on elements of per
sonal dominance and group 
loyalty, and complaints of 
misconduct, sexual or other
wise, are entirely inappro
priate and reflect a gross fail
ure to understand the nature
For any fighting force, the stronger the 
tribal and pack instinct, the greater the 
effectiveness. With U.S. forces proudly 
touted as the worlds best military, such 
incidents ... should not be unexpected
reports that the cadets may have 
been pressured into downplay
ing the beatings and that 
VMIs disciplinary measures 
were insufficient
Any indignation over the haz
ing of cadets by their mentors is 
misplaced and hypocritical. Such 
objections are the product of a 
misinformed public that has no 
conception of the purpose and 
nature of military forces.
Military society is radically dif
ferent from civilized society. In 
abstract terms, the military is 
that portion of society charged 
with taking up arms and going to 
war so that the rest of the people 
dont have to. Specifically, they 
are handed the legal right to 
commit reprehensible acts of car
nage considered outrageous in 
normal society.
A man kills a dozen people, and 
we label him a serial murderer. A 
soldier overseas does the same, 
and he is decorated for excep
the world must, in order to be 
effective, maintain fundamental 
levels of non-civility and primal 
tendencies within then structure. 
This includes tribe/pack behav
iors such as the longstanding 
military initiation rituals now 
callously referred to by an igno
rant society as mere hazing.
Students at military schools 
like VMI are initiates into the 
military tribe of warriors desig
nated to take part in the war that 
comes part and parcel with the 
nation-state system. The military 
Structure is, by necessity, one of 
pack dominance and personal 
command, with the destruction 
of the enemy the only goal.
Soldiers who have experienced 
active combat and taken part in 
actions usually considered hei
nous in polite society return home 
fundamentally changed. They 
were temporarily released from 
the civil bonds of society and al
lowed, even encouraged, to ex
of military forces. In the end, 
recruits are not join
ing the military to earn money 
for college, see the world, or honor 
their second-grade teachers. They 
are, in the same way that path
ological serial rapists and 
murderers have discovered their 
instincts, being all that 
they can be.
The parents who want the haz
ing charged as a criminal offense 
have become completely detached 
from their childrens career choice. 
The behavior of the student men
tors at VMI is not reprehensible or 
criminal  it is exemplary. From 
the ranks of the most elite fighting 
force this world has ever seen, we 
should expect nothing less.
Yishan Wong is a political ex
tremist who thinks that those 
who disagree with him are wrong. 
He does not welcome dissi
dent replies unless they are 
framed to make it look like he 
thought of them.

Dear Class of 1998,
As a senior, I have had some time to reflect 
upon my experience at Carnegie Mellon. 
(Unfortunately, I did this in my 2 pm class, oops!)
I remember the friends that came and went, especially 
the one who dated that girl for a couple of weeks 
before discovering that she was going out with this 
guy nicknamed Bison.
Some of my best memories of Carnegie Mellon are in 
the classroom. Remember the Introduction to ... 
whatever ... class where we played the namegame just 
to keep awake or the music class ... where we worked 
in theory.
But I will remember the professors most of all. My 
computational historiography professor kept my interest 
in studies when I was distracted, and we soon became 
friends.
Now that I am graduating soon, I really want to recog
nize this professor, but how?
Sincerely,
An Appreciative Senior

UPSET, from page 10
ashington coach finally saw his team 
s6ore some points.
^CMUs lead was cut down to 19-15 
with six and a half minutes left in the 
half when senior forward and co-captain 
Andy Sofish hit a three-point shot and 
drew a foul in the process. After making 
tfte free throw, CMUs lead was back to 
eight points.
The next few minutes of the game 
were marked more by the shrill sound of 
tne referees whistle than by the play of 
either team. Both teams racked up the 
fouls, and each had nine points before 
tiie 2:15 mark, which also coincided with 
the first time in several minutes that 
Carnegie Mellon was able to score.
"By this time Washington had closed 
tfte gap even further to 23-21. Finally, 
rtaesel drove the lane, ending Carnegie 
Mellons scoring drought with a layup.
JCMU owned sole control of the game 
for the remainder of the half. Freshman 
forward Geoff Barbanell hit a threepbint shot with only five seconds left to 
give Carnegie Mellon a 33-21 point lead 
ging into halftime.
The first moments of the second half 
opened in a rather pedestrian manner 
until junior forward Brad McNutt re
ceived a sharp elbow to the face and 
went down. McNutt was not harmed, 
but the blow was similar to one which he 
received a few weeks ago and which 
looked at first to have caused injury.
Junior center Dan Bowersoxwas again 
the first Tartan of the half to register 
points when he hit a shot to return CMU 
to a 12-point lead. McNutt followed on 
the teams next possession; however, 
after his basket, Washington would go 
o|n a 6-0 run and close the score to 37-32.
I CMU called a timeout to try to slow 
down Washington; however, the ploy did 
riot work. Washington closed the gap to 
3(7-36 out of the time-out. Carnegie Mellon 
looked flat and uninspired until senior 
forward Colin Shaunessey came into the 
game hollering and gesticulating wildly.
; CMU held off Washington until 11:40 
v^hen Carnegie Mellon relinquished the
lead for the first time since they took 
it at the beginning of the first half. 
Washington had found new energy, 
but they couldnt hold onto the lead. 
Bowersox showed more of his impec
cable timing by battling inside for a 
shot that would have gone in, had 
Washington not goaltended. The ref
erees called the goaltending and placed 
CMU back in the league.
CMU had taken the lead for the last 
time, and over the course of the next 
five minutes, they rebuilt their lead. 
Praesel led the way, but the rest of the 
team donated points like Ted Turner 
donates money.
After CMU had gone up by seven 
points with less than six minutes left 
in the half, Washington finally scored 
again. Washington closed the gap to 
49-47 when Praesel stole the ball with 
three minutes left and took it down 
the court for a layup. Sofish added two 
free throws to lift CMU to a 53-47 
point lead.
In the last minute of play, Washing
ton-closed the gap again. With 31 
seconds left in the game and a tenuous 
one-point lead, CMU committed a shot 
clock violation, turning the ball over 
to Washington.
Washington was able to draw a foul 
for a trip to the free throw line with 14 
seconds left. They missed both shots, 
but were able to get the rebound. In a 
frantic attempt to shoot the ball they 
tragically turned the ball over to CMU. 
With six seconds left, Washington 
fouled Shaunnessey. The only hope 
for Washington was to get a rebound 
off of his shot, and somehow hit a shot 
in the last seconds of the game.
Shaunnessey hit both of his freethrows, giving CMU a three point lead. 
Washington called a time-out and drew 
up a plan to get a three-point shot off. 
Washington did get a shot in time, but 
it was off the mark. McNutt got the 
rebound, and CMU held on for the 
victory in front of the home crowd.
The win lifted CMUs UAA record to 
47, and their season record to 9-12.
Womens team hungers for victory
By NATHAN STEINWALD
Tartan Sports Co-Editor
Victories have been hard to come by for 
the last half of the season for the womens 
basketball team. Over the course of the 
last 10 days, the team has lost three 
games, to bring their losing streak to 
nine. With only four games left in the 
season, the Tartans record stands at 6- 
14, with a UAA record of 1-10.
On Friday, February 6, Carnegie 
Mellon went to New York University to
Chris Cannon/Tartan Contributing Editor 
The Bears played great defense versus CMU.
play them for the second time this sea
son. The New York Violets proved to be 
inhospitable for Carnegie Mellon, who, 
despite shooting more than 50 percent 
in the first half, found themselves trail
ing at the end of the half by 19 points.
The second half didnt go any better 
for CMU. The teams shooting percent
age fell, and they turned the ball over 
32 times in the game. The defending 
National Champion Violets didnt let 
up, and Carnegie Mellon lost 81-56.
Two days later the team moved on 
to Boston to play Brandeis Univer
sity. They were was looking to snap 
their losing streak against the 
Brandeis Judges.
The game began poorly for the womens 
team, and despite a late run in the first 
half, CMU was facing a 33-22 deficit 
going into the second half. CMU was 
undaunted by the score and defiantly 
narrowed the separation between them
selves and Brandeis, but lost 61-58 .
The Tartans returned home this Fri
day where they played Washington who 
had overpowered Carnegie Mellon less 
than two weeks before. Despite return
ing to the familiar confines of Skibo 
Gym, Washington dominated CMU 
from start to finish.
By the end of the first five minutes of 
the game, CMU had fallen into a ninepoint hole, forcing the team to call a 
time-out. Immediately out of the play 
stoppage, sophomore guard Sherry
Cribbins hit a three-point shot to give 
the team new hope. However, Wash
ington was quick to respond. CMU was 
unable to break the Washington Uni
versity full-court press, and the offense 
couldnt penetrate the aggressive 3-2 
zone that Washington established.
By the time CMU called another timer 
out, Washington had stretched their 
lead to a 29-15 score. The Tartans had 
been unable to collect rebounds, allow
ing Washington to get second and third 
shots and at the same time failing to 
generate any for themselves.
The time-out didnt help any, and at 
halftime the score stood at 43-25. For 
the second half to hold any hope fo^ 
Carnegie Mellon, they would have tp 
improve in a number of areas. Rebound
ing would have to be better, they would 
have to break the Washington pres^, 
commit fewer fouls, and generate more 
consistent offense.
The second half ended up being wors 
than the first in most measurable ways. 
The team went from 46 percent shoot
ing in the first half to 18 percent in the 
second. The discombobulated CMU of
fense only managed 18 points in th 
entire half. They turned the ball over 11 
times to Washingtons four, and they 
didnt stop the Washington offense. 1
The game ended with the final scor 
73-43. Washington didnt allow any 
breathing room for the Tartans, who 
have now lost nine games in a row. -
Final minutes prove disastrous for team
HOCKEY, from page 10
ing goalie, grad student Jon Kliegman, shut
out RMC in the first with nine saves.
The second period started out the same 
way, with CMU playing strong and the first 
line of Fitzgerald, Duncan, and Berkowitz, 
driving to the net. Duncan got the puck in 
the zone and the trailing defenseman, 
Voulgaris, skated in and scooped it up, flip
ping it over the goalies head for a 2-0 lead.
The Tartans began to sit back on their 
heals, and Robert Morris made them pay. 
They tied the game at 2-2 before CMU was 
able to retaliate with a goal by Duncan and 
end the period with a 3-2 lead.
Maddalena told the team that they 
just had to hold onto the lead for 17 
shifts more to get the win and go home 
happy. Grzywacz, on his first shift, 
picked off the puck from a RMC forward 
and wove through two defenders to score 
and push the Tartan lead to a comfort
able 4-2. But fatigue, a few errant 
passes, and second guesses eroded 
CMUs confidence as the game wore on.
Friday night we played with a lot of 
emotion... but Saturday, we just didnt 
have it, said Grzywacz. The team 
watched Robert Morris score three un
answered goals in the final period 
including the winning one', 
shorthanded,with two minutes left.
Unfortunately, while it takes a games 
worth of effort to get some goals, we only 
need to slip up once for the other of teaip. 
to capitalize, said Kliegman. Im sure 
every player on our team, myself included, 
can think of several things they did which 
wouldve saved the game if wed just don 
something different...
The Tartans record stands at 7-7-1 
overall, 7-5-1 in their division. The team 
plays their last regular season game of the 
year against Allegheny College away, 
February 21 at 10:30 pm.

Lack of versatility cripples scoring output
The Alley Oop
by Chris Cannon
The Harlem Globetrotters was a tele
vision cartoon that spanned only 22 epi
sodes, following the adventures of the 
world famous basketball team and their 
afros. Whenever there was trouble, and 
invariably there always was, each 
Globetrotter would reveal his super pow
ers and help save the day. One guy 
would grow a super afro from which he 
pulled out handy items. Another trotter 
had spaghetti arms, which I imagined 
were great for defense.
Nowadays, spaghetti-armed defend
ers are a major reason for the reduced . 
scoring in the NBA, which has been on 
a steady decline for ten years. Anyone 
whos seen Michelangelos drawing of 
some dude standing spread-eagle in a box 
and a circle knows that the typical hu
man person has a wingspan equal to her 
height. But professional basketball play
ers, like the super-powered Globetrotters, 
are somewhat freaks of nature.
In the past, Bill Russel, Wilt Cham
berlain, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and 
Moses Malone dominated the league.
Now the NBA has more role players, 
who arent the same offensive work-American Olympians struggle for medals
horses. Without looking at the current Mitch Richmond, has four times as many 
starring centers (Shaquille ONeal, attemps as rebounds. The only player 
Hakeem Olajuwon, David Robinson) its that doesnt follow the trend is Camby. 
easy to see that the leagues biggest But Camby hits only 39.9 percent of 
defenders are all situational players. his shots from the field, which helps
Shot blockers Marcus Camby of explain Torontos 11-40 record. All five 
Toronto, Philadelphias Theo Ratliff, shot-blockers average under ten points 
Sacramentos Michael Stewart, Orlandos a game and are lousy free-throw shootBo Outlaw, and Utahs Greg Ostertag are ers. Whats more, the defenders have no 
all prime suspects in this trend. Four out distinct body type, 
of the five are in the top ten in blocked From the relativley short 68 Outlaw, 
shots per game, and Ostertagis 13th. But to the chunky Ostertag at 72 280 pounds, 
unlike the stars, none of the 
five has any offensive skills.
Ostertag, Outlaw, and 
Stewart all have more re
bounds than shots taken, and 
Ratliffe is only six re
bounds shy of the 
same feat. In com
parison Stewarts 
teammate, guard
Mohd Zekri Ismail/Tartan Art Staff
and the wiry Camby 
at 611 227 pounds, 
these players fit no 
body stereotype. 
However, the 
group can be 
catagorizedbya 
single term: 
hatchet-men. 
Besides blocking 
shots, grabbing re
bounds, and not taking
shots, the five all have the job of commit
ting tons of fouls. Fouls are best expressed; 
in minutes per foul, since once a player 
accumlates a lot of fouls, he has to go to the, 
bench. Ostertag rings in at 8.07, Ratliffe, 
at 7.86, and Stewart in an average of 7.1 
before he commits each foul. If these guys 
played the whole game, theyd foul out 
every contest. Outlaw and Camby check 
in at a relatively friendly 10.23 and 10.61 
respectively. Even without their paltry 
offensive numbers, its clear that these' 
guys couldnt be stars because their fouls 
would keep them on the bench. This is 
also in direct contrast with Chamberlain,. , 
the greatest center ever, who never fouled. 
out of an NBA game.
While free agency has increased bad. 
team chemistry, early draft entries turn . 
out under-developed players, and a weak^ 
ened overall talent pool due to expansion 
have helped bring the scoring average in 
the NBA down, better defense is actually 
contributing also. Wtih the great centers 
that traditionally dominate a defense, 
the league now has an increased number 
of purely defensive stars.
While the trend didnt exaclty 
begin with the Globetrotters, the next, 
installment of defense might be comr/ 
ing from the team. The Globetrotters* 
rookieDut Mayar from Sudan, who at 
76-l/2 can dunk a basketball without 
leaving the floor, may be the next great 
shot-blocker. Now if he can only grow 
an afro and pull stuff out of it.

SWIMMING, from page 10
Education Department Joan 
Maser, look at the affair as 
an exceptional opportunity 
for the home team to cap
italize on a superb season 
and showcase the newest pool 
in the University Athletic Asso
ciation on large scale.
As for the actual swim team, 
the Tartans have not competed 
since January 3, when both the 
men and women ended one of 
their most successful regular 
seasons in Carnegie Mellon his
tory with wins over West Vir
ginia Wesleyan University.
The victory gave the women 
Tartans their first winning sea
son ever with a 6-4 record and 
lifted the men to 8-2  one of 
the best marks for the CMU 
men in recent memory.
Since then, the team has gone 
though a series of intense work
outs coupled with periods of rest. 
The workouts have featured less 
yardage and weightlifting in 
an attempt to rest and taper 
the team in preparation for 
the championships.
Exceptional records coupled 
with home pool advantage have 
combined to set hopes high for
the Tartan teams. The CMU 
women expect one of their strongest showings ever in the 
Championships while the men 
hope to challenge Emory 
University for second place 
while giving perennial 
front-runner Johns Hopkins 
University a run for their 
money. We are at an advan
tage in that we know every 
part of the pool  from the 
lanes to the turns to the light
ing  better than anyone 
else, said head swim coach 
David Belowich.
No matter what the results, 
Belowich predicts every single 
pool record in every event will 
be broken. I just hope a lot of 
those new records will have 
CMU after them, he said.
If anticipation and optimism 
are any indication, the Tartans 
may be prepared for one of the 
most successful championship 
events in school history. Sopho
more Michael Robinson said, 
With all the sacrifices of time 
and energy that everyone is 
making this semester, you can 
be sure thatwe are going to 
make it all worthwhile when it 
comes time for UAAs.

McGranaghan and senior Melissa

In the3000 meter event, the men placed 
eighth, 10th, 11th, and 12th out of 40 
finishers., The mens team is finally 
startingto look like a team, said Meckley. 
They could do very well in upcoming 
meets, but they will be up against some 
tough competition at UAAs.

It has a spectator balcony for cheering

but overall the team feels like they have 
a chance. We have good meets when we 
compete at Denison, said Donatelli.
The team is not as large as other teams, 
however, and some competitors are forced 
to run back and forth between events 
occurring at the same time or very close 
to each other. Binkley did not make the 
top ten in the hurdles, possibly because 
the pole vault was scheduled very close to 
the same time.

Club upsets top-ranked rival
By JESSICA STRELITZ
Tartan Senior Staffwriter
In an emotional weekend of play, the 
Carnegie Mellon ice hockey team split its 
two away games, beating previously un
defeated Indiana University of Pennsyl
vania (TUP) II and barely losing to thirdseeded Robert Morris College (RMC). The 
huge IUP win all but sealed CMUs hope 
for aplayoffbid, as only one game remains 
in the regular season.
Indiana had shut out CMU in the previ
ous meeting between the two teams 3-0. 
But the Tartans were on a winning 
streak, had nothing to lose, and 
started things off right. Fighting 
flu and a fever, sophomore Przemyslaw (P.J.) Grzywacz scored 
through the five-hole on a break 
away during his first shift of the 
game. Team captain and senior 
Paul Voulgaris set Grzywacz up 
with a deep pass.
Indiana quickly countered, mak
ing the score 1-1. Minutes later,
IUP increased their lead to 2-1, 
Undaunted, CMU got back up 
again. A minute later, the first line 
crashed down the ice, and graduate 
student Jonathan Berkowitz got 
the puck out in front of the net. 
Graduate student Adam Duncan 
was the man to put it away, tying 
the game at 2-2. Then, with less 
than 10 seconds left in the period, fresh
man Rick Ebert sent in a shot that dribbled 
through the IUP tenders pads to score 
and put the Tartans up 3-2. The second 
period was quiet as the Tartans continued 
their smart, clean play. IUP scored half
way through the period, tying it up 3-3.
A lot of people on our side, fans, even
The defense did overtime work 
throughout the game, but especially in 
the beginning of the third as they fought 
to kill a four-minute penalty. The de
fensive unit shifted only two pairs 
throughout the game. The work paid 
off ten minutes into the period. On a 
pass from senior Scott Fitzgerald, 
Duncan sprinted down the right-hand 
side and sent in a slap shot that would 
be the game-winning goal. IUP  hard 
as they hit and dogged Grzywacz, se
nior Derek Jander, and the first line  
couldnt get the Tartans to budge.
I am so proud of this team.... We won 
that game because everyone gave it their 
all and left it all out on the ice, said Min.
In sports, the hardest thing to do is to 
come out after a huge win and pour your 
heart and soul into another game the next 
night. CMU tried to on Saturday night. 
The team was pumped before ice time, 
but the game was severely delayed due to 
the Robert Morris College staff messing 
around with the sound system, having an 
entire ceremony for the teams one se
nior, and making three ice cuts, includ
ing one after the initial warm-up. It was

The CMU mens basketball 
team started the first of its last 
three games by losing an away 
game for the third time in a row 
and then bounced back for two 
victories, including an upset of 
Washington University at Skibo 
Gym on Friday.
! On February 6, Carnegie 
.Mellon headed to New York Uni
versity for its third straight road 
game. CMU had recently beaten 
the NYU Violets but was also 
coming off of two recent losses to 
Chicago University and Wash
ington University.
Carnegie Mellon opened up 
poorly against the Violets, and 
the first half ended with CMU 
losing by the score of 36-20. In 
the second half, CMU tried to 
pull itself back into the game. 
They more than matched the 
effort of the Violets and
outscored them in the half, 42- 
37, more than doubling their 
first-half effort.
Unfortunately, 16 points was 
too much for the Tartans to over
come, and despite pulling to 
within five points in the closing 
moments of the game and junior 
forward Chris Butskos 12 sec
ond-half points, CMU lost. The 
final score was 73-62.
Two days after the loss to NYU, 
Carnegie Mellon played its 
fourth road game, facing off 
against Brandeis University for 
the second time this season. The 
Judges had already accounted 
for one of the Tartans UAA vic
tories this season. This time 
Brandeis presented a tougher 
challenge to CMU, but Carnegie. 
Mellon had already lost three 
straight games and showed their 
own resilience in the hostile 
Brandeis arena.
The early moments of the sec
ond half turned out to be the

formative ones of the match, as 
CMU parlayed a one point halftime lead into a double-digit 
cushion. The lead stuck, and with 
junior forward Tommy Praesels 
team and career high of 23 points 
and Butskos career high of 18, 
Carnegie Mellon left Boston with 
a 68-58 win.
With the tough road strech 
behind them, CMU returned 
home to Pittsburgh to play 
Washington on Friday. Wash
ington had handed the Tartans 
a tough loss of108-77 two weeks 
ago in St. Louis. Fridays game 
moved at a much slower pace 
than the previous meeting of the 
two teams, but CMU was in con
trol for most of the game.
Carnegie Mellon grabbed the 
lead and control of the half 
after junior center Dan 
Bowersox scored the teams 
first points of the game to tie it 
in the first minute. A wellbalanced offense helped the 
Tartans open up an 11-2 lead 
in the first five minutes.
Washington tried to counter 
CMUs success by adjusting 
their lineup, but was unsuccess
ful. With 13 minutes left in the 
half, Praesel drew a foul for the 
second time in a minute and 
forced Washington to call a time
out.
Out of the time-out, Wash
ington University earned a trip 
to the foul line, and for the first 
time since the first possession 
of the game put new points on 
the score board. Carnegie 
Mellon remained undeterred in 
their single-minded quest to 
keep the scorers table busy. 
The Tartans played strong de
fensively and rebounded well 
enough to deny Washington real 
opportunities to score.

old University Center to date. 
Over 350 swimmers, divers, 
coaches, trainers, and fans from 
eight east coast and mid-western 
universities will converge on the 
pool for the four-day affair.
Starting Wednesday and con
tinuing through Saturday, there 
will be no recreational swimming 
and no swimming, aqua aerobic, 
or lifeguarding classes. Much of 
the second floor seating or recre
ation area that overlooks the 
pool, including the aerobic activ

USA struggles to capture gold
By PETER PATTERSON
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
Picabo Street came into these 
Olympic games with high expec
tations for herself. The always 
confident American alpine skier 
did not disappoint as she raced 
for the gold in the womens Super-G. In doing so, she surprised 
herself, along with much of the 
skiing world.
Street is, first and foremost, a 
downhill specialist. She won sil
ver in that event in the 1994 
games at Lillehammer and has 
twice won the World Cup season 
circuit. Never before, however, 
had she won a Super-G event on 
the world level. Adding length to 
her already long odds was the 
fact that Street just recently be
gan skiing again after a careerthreatening knee injury just 14 
months ago. She had reconstruc
tive surgery to repair two torn 
ligaments and damaged cartilage. 
And, in a tune-up event for the 
Olympics in January, Street fell, 
causing soreness and headaches 
that persisted to the games and 
shook her confidence.
Her win came in dramatic fash
ion. Street was the second skier 
to race in^the event and had to
watch nervously as her com
petitors aimed at her time. Her 
first scare came from Alexandra 
Meissnitzer, who came within 
.07 seconds of Streets time. Af
ter Meissnitzer, racer after racer 
came down the hill unable to . 
break Streets mark. The celNagano 1998
Games of the XVIII Olympiad
ebration had nearly begun when 
Meissnitzers Austrian team
mate Michaela Dorfmeister 
started her run from the 18th 
position. She crossed the finish 
line with a time .01 seconds 
behind Street.
Then the celebration could 
begin. Street, downhill spe
cialist, had come back from 
major knee surgery to win the 
closest womens Super-G race 
in Olympic history.
I dont have as much pressure 
on myself in the Super-G. I think 
some of the other people expect
more from me in the Super-G 
than I did, said Street according 
to the Associated Press. What
ever expectations were held, they 
have been fulfilled, but Street will 
not be content unless she can 
match her gold in the slalom with 
one in the downhill competition.
In other news from Nagano, 
the history of the United States 
lugers in the Olympics has 
not been a very colorful one. At 
least not the colors gold, silver, or 
bronze. In the 34 years since 
the event was introduced as 
a medal sport, the team has failed 
to come home with any top 
three finishes.
That is, until the Nagano 
games. The Americans broke out 
of their drought, and in a big way. 
They won not one, but two med
als in the mens doubles event. 
The team of Gordy Sheer and 
Chris Thorpe won the silver, beat
ing out teammates Mark 
Grimmette and Brian Martin, 
who won the bronze. The Ger
man tandem of Krauss and 
Behrendt won the gold, but the 
failure to claim the top spot on 
the medal stand could not put a 
damper on the Americans day.

NTREPRENEURSHIP 101
By RHONDA GILLESPIE
Tartan Staffwriter
Twice retired and livingin alarge 
house in Boca Raton, Fla., Jack 
Roseman just cant stay away from 
what he loves: entrepreneurship.
Roseman  the associate di
rector for the Donald H. Jones 
Center for Entrepreneurship, 
Jones Distinguished adjunct pro
fessor, and head of the under
graduate Entrepreneurship pro
gram  considers himself somewhat of an evangelist. He teaches 
students in the undergraduate 
business program how to be suc
cessful in their own business ven
tures, as well as in their lives. 
He feels Entrepreneurship 
should be a required course for 
every student at CMU.
Although he never took a busi
ness course himself, Roseman 
is helping to mold CMU stu
dents into future business lead
ers. He teaches students the ba
sics and the not-so-basics that
he didnt know starting out and 
had to learn along the way. The 
brochure for the Donald H. Jones 
Center bills itself as the 
Launching Pad for Entrepre
neurs, and the pages contain a 
number of success stories, many 
of which are due at least in part, 
to Roseman.
As a human being, you have 
a right to exist. As a company, 
you have to earn that right ev
ery day, he said. This is one 
reason Roseman is still involved
with teaching. He wants to teach 
students how to market them
selves such that they can con
vince other people that their 
business is necessary and has a 
right to exist. He stresses that 
people have to be able to know 
and market their capabilities.
Although students maybe in a 
hurry to get out of school and 
begin employing the knowledge
that they gained in Rosemans 
classes, he advises students not 
to try to start a business right 
out of college.
Take a job for two to three 
years, get experience, mature, 
learn from your boss, good or 
bad, he said. Leave the com
pany, no matter how much you 
like it, and go to work for an
other. Learn, mature, and keep
your eyes open for opportunities 
to start your own business, espe
cially in large companies. 
Roseman loves failure. As an 
example of why, he related a story 
about sitting in his rocking chair 
and watching his granddaughter 
learn to walk. The child would 
get up, take a few steps, fall, 
laugh, and start all over again.

BECOMES STARTUP SUCCESS
By ANAND MARATHE

The most important thing that 
students will hear from professors 
is to get focused: Establish what 
your market is and focus, said Eric 
Boduch, president of Vision Sys
tems. I think its a great [opportu
nity] working in a startup  the 
experience is invaluable.
Boduch graduated from CMU 
in 1996 with a degree in electrical 
and computer engineering and then 
went on to help build the company 
Vision Systems.
Things happened by accident; it 
started by consulting at school as a
source of income and just grew from 
there, he said.
He started the company in 1995 as 
an Internet development firm spe
cializing in information manage
ment. Then, last year, the company 
began to focus their expertise on 
complex systems with overlapping 
Internet technologies and relational 
databases. They also started work 
on Cerebellum, a product that puts 
together a platform for accessing 
data throughout an enterprise.
In 1997 the company became fo
cused on the areas in the market
place that were growing very fast, 
said Boduch. For example, now we 
are focused on a very hot area that
has brought to us 
the attention of 
the media and 
analysts to the 
point where weve 
had to slow things 
down a bit to keep up.
Vision Systems prod
uct development team 
has almost $1 million, and 
according to Boduch, that 
money came because of the 
products strength.

Fair offers opportunities for healthier lifestyle

for everyone at the 12th an

last Thursday.
Each year, local health 
practitioners set up booths 
alongside of those sponsored 
by Student Health Services 
and other campus depart
ments in order to help the 
students, faculty, and staff 
of CMU, as well as the Pitts
burgh community, become healthier and 
more aware of the services available to 
them on and off campus.
The importance of the fail* is to bring 
awareness in the health, wellness, and 
fitness areas to each one of us. Also it gives 
the general community the chance to ex

their chance to experience something new 
or different.... Also with Feburary being 
Healthy Heart Month, the focus blends 
well with the event.
At this years health fair, many stu
dents took advantage of the free mas
sages and chiropractic screenings that 
were offered. Local practitioners also offered the opportunity 
to have cholesterol lev
els, body fat amounts, 
and blood pressure 
checked free of charge.
The tests offer ev

said Melody Manning,

of the event.
Being free, these 
health tests drew a 
large crowd from on

would have never gone 
and gotten my cholesterol checked at a

Information and products dealing with 
physical fitness were also featured at 
the health fair. Gatto Bike Shop, a local 
vendor, brought products such as bicycle helmets and equipment, and talked 
to people about bicycling for health or 
recreation. Visitors to the fair could buy 
their bike products on the spot. Other 
vendors brought step machines, tread
mills, and various exercise equipment 
for the community to try out or order.

We hope that people get the idea 
that they can eat healthy and still enjoy 
their food, said Jeff Berkowitz,. culi
nary manager for Hospitality Services, 
who represented Catering at the fair. 
We also wanted people to know that 
[they] can request healthy items from 
us. We can do anything.
According to Morosky, this years fair 
was a success overall, with more stu
dents participating and taking advan
tage of the opportunities available, prob
ably because of the University Center 
facilities and the high amount of pub
licity this year.
Its great to see the interaction of all 
ages of the health fair visitors with the 
exhibitors who take time out from their 
businesses to answer questions and even 
offer treatment, said Manning.

Starting next weekend, senior profes
sional writing major Dani Barnard wont 
be getting much sleep  a problem no 
CMU student needs. But shell be even 
more involved in what she is most pas
sionate about  Buggy.
As the Sweepstakes Chair, Barnard is 
responsible for running morning Buggy 
practices and organizing all B uggy events 
this year, requiring her to rise at some 
pretty early hours. The Buggy course runs 
through Tech and Frew Streets, as well as 
roads outside of the CMU campus, which 
means that the Sweepstakes crew has to 
be out as early as 3 am to avoid traffic.
In her fourth year of Buggy, Barnard 
started as a member of the SDC push team. 
This year, she and other members of the 
Sweepstakes Committee will make all the 
preparations for the Carnival Buggy com
petition. She hopes to leave her mark on 
one of CMUs unrivaled traditions.
The Tartan: How did you get involved 
in Sweepstakes?
Dani Barnard: I lived in Henderson 
when I was a freshman. SDC has their 
Buggy room in there, and they kind of 
talked me into it. After you do it once, 
you cant stop. Theres something about 
[being on Buggy]. Part of it is definitely 
the community, and the fact that it 
doesnt go on at any other school. When 
you see other people in your classes who 
you know from Buggy, you have an un
derstanding of what its like to be up at
three in the morning sweepingthe roads.
TT: Can you explain what the morning 
preparation for Buggy practices is like?
DB: The night before, one organiza
tion is in charge of bagging all the 
parking meters so no one parks [on 
Tech and Frew Streets]. Sometimes we 
have to call for trucks to tow people who 
park there anyway. Well do a walk to 
make sure the weathers okay. And then 
people will line haybales along the edge 
of the streets  thats just because 
something might happen, like a driver 
will accidentally go straight when they 
mean to turn. There are about ten orga
nizations that split up the jobs, and it 
takes a couple of hours.
TT: Have you ever seen an accident 
while watching Buggy?
DB: A couple of years ago, a driver 
from one organization just got disori
ented; I think she thought the bridge 
wasnt turning as soon as it did. And a 
driver from one organization had to be 
asked to not drive anymore because she 
was too tall, and there was no room. If 
the person is too tall, sometimes there 
isnt room for steering and brakes.
People laugh about it, they say its just 
Buggy, but we tell drivers not to drive 
drunk. There have been instances where 
a crash has been related to alcohol.
TT: Do you think that working on Sweep
stakes attracts a certain kind of person?
DB: I dont know. Its just a love for 
competition and a love for something 
unique. Theres so many different kinds 
of people. They come from all different 
areas. Its really a love for Buggy. I mean,
Anthony Chao/Tartan Photo Editor
After three years, Dani Barnard still gets up in the wee hours of the morning for Buggy.
Im an English major  youd think that 
it would be all [mechanical engineers].
But [Buggy participants] need to be 
able to wake up early on the weekends 
if they are out. Thats what usually 
scares people away.
TT: What was your favorite time dur
ing Sweepstakes?
DB: The best feeling was my sopho
more year  I was on the SDC womens
team, and we placed third. I was push
ing on Hill 5, and I love that hill. But 
when we waited though the next rounds, 
we found out that we had placed third, 
and were overjoyed. It stayed with me 
for a long time, and it made me love 
Buggy. We got a trophy, and thats the 
first time in many, many years that 
SDC has placed.
And of course theres race day parties.

Eating disorder group 
offers support, therapy
By LISA RUMP
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
For many students, college provides 
a chance to make a new image  a 
chance to go from being the overweight 
kid in high school to the thin person in 
college. Thus, according to Dr. Cynthia 
Valley, college students are at a high 
risk for developing eating disorders.
To help combat this problem at CMU, 
Valley, a psychologist at Counseling 
and Psychological Services, is leading 
an eating disorder therapy group. It 
started last November and is consid
ered to be a major thrust in addressing 
the issue of eating disorders on cam
pus, according to Valley. Most stu
dents coming through [the counseling 
center] recently for eating disorders 
have joined the group, she said.
This long-term service is free. Stu
dents in the group are in all stages of the 
disorder: full diagnosis, showing some 
symptoms, or recovery. Several students 
are also receiving individual therapy.
Valley is also the coordinator of the 
Eating Disorders Task Force, which is 
comprised of the Counseling Center, 
Health Services, Residence Life, and 
faculty members. The task force is 
working to promote an eating disorder 
education program in conjunction with 
St. Francis Hospital, and holding a 
number of programs during National 
Eating Disorder Week, February 23- 
27. The schedule includes an educa
tional presentation by a St. Francis 
psychologist as well as assessments 
and referrals for interested students.
According to Valley, Health Services 
and the Counseling Center are put
ting together a protocol for working 
with students with eating disorders in 
order to coordinate services and con
sult on individual cases. This service 
should be completed by March and
will allow the Counseling Center to 
know that students receiving psycho
therapy are healthy and complying 
with their treatment.
[The protocol] will enable us to make 
decisions that are clinically responsible, 
said Valley. We can decide when stu
dents can be treated at the University or 
be referred [to an outside center]. 
Anne Green, professor of modern lan
guages and survivor of an eating disor
der, said she was always on the heavier 
side; but when she started college, no 
one knew her and her friends thought 
she was thin and exercised often.
People made comments and noticed 
I ate funny, [but] even I wasnt willing 
to admit I had a problem, said Green.
Through counseling, however, she 
found the root of her problem: a lack of 
confidence and self-esteem. I didnt 
know who I was, she said.
One student said that her eating 
disorder began from a combination of 
feeling she had no control over her 
decisions and being slightly overweight. 
According to Valley, people may begin 
to feel that their weight is the one area 
in their life they can control.
[Eating disorders are] an outer 
manifestation of an inner problem, 
said Green. The deeper issue is often 
a problem with self-esteem' and selfworth. People sometimes feel they 
have a lack of control and an eating 
disorder is the result.
People often try therapy several times 
before any real progress is made. Green 
said she began group therapy after. 
finishing graduate school and forced 
herself to admit her problem. The 
therapy cant help the person until the 
person is ready to help him or herself.
If you know someone [with a disor
der], be concerned, said Green. A 
friend can be an instrument to guide 
someone to an earlier resolution.

buy it.  He pointed out that this 
part of the startup process is very 
crucial and requires more cre
ativity than knowledge.
When the killer application has 
finally been produced, it is time 
to find companies who are inter
ested in the product. He and his 
two partners went to some orga
nizations, but they said that they 
already had developers working 
on the project. They could have 
given up the venture with that 
discovery, but instead, they asked 
one of those developers to become 
the fourth founder. It is naive, 
Wegbreit said, to quit a venture 
with a setback that late in the 
process, even though he continu
ally reminded everyone of the 
risks of starting a business.
Nevertheless, many of the 
people in the audience admired 
Wegbreits success and ease of 
accomplishment, including Pat 
Larkin, a sophomore computer 
science major.

Chris Allwein, also a sopho
more computer science major, 
came to see what Epiphany 
and the marketing software 
industry were all about, but 
now he may try to start a busi
ness in the future as well.
Ive heard a lot before about 
how [startups] can be difficult 
... but [Wegbreit] had a lot of 
enthusiasm about it and that 
made me enthusiastic as well, 
said Allwein.
Wegbreits enthusiasm paid 
off, as he and the other 
founders worked on their first 
product in the fall of 1996, and 
in January 1997, Epiphany

ciate director of the Center for 
Entrepreneurship in GSIA. Jack 
Roseman was a mentor all 
through school. In fact, he still 
sits on the board of Vision Sys
tems,said Boduch.
Boduch felt that having a pro
fessor to discuss ideas with was 
very beneficial. He also found that 
ECE and computer science classes 
helped him with problem solving 
techniques. Specifically, his class 
in hardware design was a real 
help, and even though the subject 
matter may not apply to his posi
tion now, the thought process is 
still important to him. Unlike at 
school, which was all work, we do  
have fun, too, said Boduch.
Todd Olson, another ECE 
graduate, joined Boduch early in 
the creation of the company. He 
is currently director of Technol
ogy for Vision Systems and is 
heading up the product develop
ment team responsible for Cer
ebellum. One thing about Olson 
that caught Boduchs eye was 
that he had worked on one of 
MBNA banks major systems 
since he was 14.
Those are the types of people 
Vision Systems is looking for: 
those who did something spe
cial through high school or col
lege, said Boduch.
Funding is one problem 
Boduch faced in starting Vi
sion. The initial funding [for 
Vision Systems] came from 
friends and family, but we 
were really making money 
from the get go, said Boduch. 
He said that his family and 
friends were pretty much be
hind him all the way, but they 
wanted him to know all the 
options he had.

than I would have in the work

him, startups are relatively well

This is a real X-File, folks. Thats 
how researcher Robert Hastings intro
duced one of several government docu
ments presented at his lecture UFOs: 
The Hidden History, held on Monday, 
February 9 in McConomy Auditorium. 
The presentation attempted to offer evi
dence, in the form of previously classi
fied documents, of a massive cover-up by 
the United States government regard
ing the existence of UFOs.
Hastings started his discussion by ex
plaining how his interest in UFOs began 
when he experienced a UFO sighting at 
an Air Force missile base in 1967. Since 
that time, he has collabo
rated with other research
ers and collected evidence 
through the Freedom of In
formation Act, which gives 
citizens access to most gov
ernment documents, pro
vided that the release of the 
information does not jeop
ardize national security.
After this brief introduc
tion, Hastings presented a 
30-minute slide show that 
chronicled the history of 
UFOs in America and the 
governments alleged 
cover-up, starting with the 
first UFO sighting in 1947.
These sightings  many 
of which occurred at mili
tary bases, rocket test 
sites, and atomic weapons 
development centers  
consisted of flying saucers 
that traveled at high speeds, hovered 
above the earth, and performed incred
ible maneuvers. He presented evidence 
that the government, although aware 
and concerned about the existence of 
UFOs, has taken precautions to pre
vent the public from knowing the truth 
by instituting a debunking campaign 
through the mass media.
It seemed like the slide show was a 
presentation of reverse government prosingers PITTSBURGH

paganda and that the quotes might have 
been taken out of context, said Rob 
Migliore, a junior electrical and com
puter engineering major.
Hastings explained that proof of UFO 
sightings exists in military and intelli
gence documents that have recorded situ
ations where flying saucers have been 
tracked on radar, unsuccessfully followed 
by jets, and witnessed by high-ranking 
military personnel. According to 
Hastings, his evidence contradicts the 
governments dismissal of these events 
as hoaxes, hallucinations, and 
misidentification of known objects.
I believe he had irrefutable evidence 
that something is up. I found it very 
intriguing and am interested in pursufirst began coincides exactly with the 
period in which nuclear weapons were ] 
developed. He believes that the reason 
why so many UFO sightings have oc
curred at nuclear test sites is because \ 
there is someone out there who is try-1 
ing to warn us that we are making a 
big mistake by getting ourselves in
volved with nuclear weaponry.
Following the lecture, Hastings held 
a question and answer session where; 
audience members were given the op
portunity to inquire further about spe
cific issues and voice their opinions 
about what they heard.
I think the lecture was as convinc
ing as any other documentary Ive seen 
on TV or article I have read. But I

ing my own line of inquiry further, 
said Theresa Lacombe, a freshman ar
chitecture major.
After the slide show, Hastings pre
sented and explained a series of govern
ment documents regarding the subject 
of UFOs that were sent to such people as 
the secretary of defense, the President, 
and the head of the CIA.
Hastings raised the issue that the 
period in history when UFO sightings
think his opinions are not based on; 
enough information, said Kim Mar
tin, a sophomore math and computer; 
science double major.
Hastings is aware that there arei 
many people who are doubtful about! 
his ideas. I think it is very healthy to !

\ Mainstream radio has no sense of history. Less than 
ljOyears ago the land was ablaze about that funny new 
song by Queen, which was in fact Bohemian Rhap
sody, a serious tour de force recorded more than 15 
years before. Lately much talk has been made of a 
goofy new punk-like sound called ska. Funny, I 
dpjijdve sworn it was at least twice as old as me.
| 3Lthink the resurgence in ska during the past 
tKEge years has two basic factors, said resident 
CM;U rude boy Austin Shifrin, a masters student 
inpublic policy and management. First, it is tied 
to the re-examination of all things retro. A lot of 
people are curious about lifestyles, fashions, and 
music that were around before our day. You can 
se& this also happening with lounge music and 
rockabilly. Second, the rhythm is extremely catchy.
| Ska, in its purest, most identifiable form, is a 
bouncy form of music that, at first listen, sounds like 
sped-up reggae with horns.
! 1 think the biggest attraction to ska is its energy, said 
junior material science and engineering major Brian 
Mendelssohn, another resident ska authority. The con
stant upbeat makes [the music] more of a dance beat 
because it has consistency and quickness.... The quicker 
consistent beat in rock and roll adds more energy to the 
music without resorting to loud, heavy guitar tricks.
; The first embryonic signs of ska appeared in 1950s Ja
maica. There, the American sounds of R&B were mixed with 
ijidigeneous Carribbean mento music and jazz and were 
transported to the people by massive Sound Systems  mobile 
If-^lystems mounted on flat-bed trucks. In the later part of that 
decade, with the nations impending independence from Britain,
4 iifajor Jamaican record producer by the name of dem
oni; Sir Coxsone Dodd, in a rather nationalistic 
move, challenged his musicians to create 
a distinctly Jamaican form of dance 
music. In the early 1960s, this move 
qame to fruition with not only Dodds musi
cians, but-also with those from the upstart Trojan 
andjsland Records and Prince Busters Voice of the 
people. Sound Systems wiping the trappings of calypso and 
other identifiable genres from the sound. The result was the now trademark jazzy 
bass, melodic horn section, and rhythm guitar playing on the upbeat rather than the 
downbeat. At this time it was a predominately instrumental form. Ska turned 
acceptable dance music inside out, and, later in the decade, gave birth to to the 
mere political reggae and dub. >
j Jamaica may have been freed from Britian, but the cultural exchange was about 
tp wing in the opposite direction. With the likes of Jamacian rude boys and reggae 
superstars The Wailers influencing (and inadvertantly giving birth to) the first 
British skinhead movement on then many trips to the European nation, ska was 
revitalized in the mid-1970s. The music sped up farther, thanks to bands like The 
Clash who fused ska and early punk. The 2 Tone record label established the

: jsIt takes a real man to admit when he is 
less than expert on a subject, and seeing 
as how I frequently include myself in the 
beefcake category, I will buck up and 
admit I am no expert when it comes to ska 
music. Yeah, I know the names: the Toast
ers, Skankin Pickle, and the Epitones. I 
even scoff at the imbecile who believes 
that the Bosstones are true-blue ska. 
Obviously, now that they have achieved 
ijiuge popularity in the States, they lose 
their tie to the small underground scene, 
stupid. Once you get airtime on the X, 
its all over for your original mates, cause 
theyve ditched your ass for more obscure 
bands. But as Ive suspected for many 
years, the ska scene has some serious 
laistory  history that even I cannot fully 
absorb. So, bear with me and forgive my 
toe-stomping of die-hard ska fans piggies.
What: Skarmageddon
Company: MoonNYC Records
! As a learning experience in the ska 
$ent'e, I listened to Skarmageddon, a 
liwj^CD compilation of 2 Tone, 60s, and 
9Q;ska from MoonNYC Records. It in
cludes none of the aforementioned bands, 
so mainstream awareness of this music 
is not a threat to anyone who worries 
about staying on the edge of the ska 
scene. Bands like The Invaders, JC 
Superska, Skapone, The Skunks, and 
Gals Panic number among the most 
compelling groups on Skarmageddon, 
pumping out jams that make you wanna 
graj your pork-pie hat and narrow tie 
ar^Jgo bang around with some friends at 
4 concert. That said, to those of us who
like what weve heard from bands like 
(gasp) Reel Big Fish and Rancid, this 
two-disc set is enjoyable. But first, a 
little background info for those of us less 
versed in ska history.
Skarmageddon draws from all three 
waves of skas history,' mostly from 2 
Tone and third wave styles: the first, 
mid-tempo Jamaican ska; the second, 
faster, tighter, 80s ska; and the newest, 
wave, projecting its wider influence onto 
bands such as No Doubt.
Each band uses the typi
cal ska configuration of 
bass, rhythm guitars, 
drums, a trombone and 
trumpet player, and the oc
casional organ. Songs us
ing slower, more intricate 
bass lines are tossed in with 
fast tempo tracks.
Both CDs in the set will 
bringabouttoe-tappingand, 
depending on your mood, 
fist-pumping and hipthrashing. The music is just 
so damnhappy. Some tracks 
are soliD, with the others 
not diving into the toilet but 
becoming repetitive by the 
third minute or so.
The coolest tracks have 
pronounced bass lines, 
with the soul of the ska 
style at the absolute front 
of the tunes and the other 
instruments layered un
derneath. All in all, this 
compilation from Moon 
Records is worth the green
backs it costs and will most 
likely go into heavy rota
tion on youistereo.

Its kinda funny how I found out 
about 2 Tone, a record label estab
lished in the 70s. I remember watch
ing The Polices video for Roxanne a 
few years back and seeing Sting clad 
in a really cool shirt that had a pic
ture of a skanking rude girl on it. 
The Beat was written across his 
chest. So I bought a Beat record.
The Beat (known in the U.S. as The 
English Beat) were a part of the 2 Tone 
family, British bands united by a com
mon record label and a common prin
ciple: racial unity. The musics mes
sage was incarnated by rude boys/girls, 
black and white outfits, checkers, and 
the 2 Tone logo, depicting Walt Jabsco.
GloSKAry
Wave Theory: The concept of the genre having three distinct 
periods of mainstream popularity, starting with the 1964 World 
Fair Jamacian exhibit in New York.
First Wave: 1960s Jamacian instrumental. Gave birth to 
rocksteady, reggae, and dub. Most mellow and jazz-oriented of the 
movements.
Second Wave (or 2 Tone Era): Late 1970s to early 1980s Britian. 
Typified by under-produced punk values and an accelerated beat.
Third Wave: Early 1990s to present America. Mass diversification, 
although most notably with the punk subgenres.
Ska-Core: A melding of loud riff-heavy punk with either 2 Tone or 
Latin Ska, and much influenced by Operation Ivy (Suicide Ma^ 
chines, Less Than Jake, Voodoo Glow Skulls).
Rude Boy: Originally blue-collar Jamacian youths held up as either 
hoodlums or heros by the local people. Now it is used to describe 
a serious ska fan with a excellent grasp of the musics history and 
politics.
Sound System: Travelling PA systems for parties and festivals in 
1960s Jamaica.

The music of the 2 Tone label was the 
fusing of the predominantly black ska 
genre with predominantly white punk. 
But where did it come from?
England was not a fun place to be in 
1962. When the British government 
ceased unlimited immigration into En
gland from the West Indies, violent race 
riots ensued. At least something produc
tive came of it. Intent on disbanding 
racial tensions, many 70s British punk 
bands (namely The Clash) began to fuse 
reggae into their music.
Jerry Dammers, who grew up during 
the race riots, immersed himself in the 
movement by starting a band called 
the Automatics, who played punk in
tertwined with reggae rhythms. The 
blend with reggae, however, didnt 
sound right for them. Realizing this, 
they embraced reggaes 
predecessor, ska, and 
changed their name to the 
Special AKA.
Influenced by the success 
stories of specialized labels 
such as Motown, Dammers 
decided that the Special 
AKA should start a record 
label. I just wanted 2 Tone 
to be like a little club. And 
if you liked the music you 
became part of it, said 
Dammers in a 1993 inter
view. The band borrowed 
enough money to record 
one track, and due to lack 
of cash, they used a prere
corded instrumental track, 
gave it ska guitars and used 
it as a flip side. They rolled 
5,000 copies and a new logo 
off the assembly line, and 2 
Tone Records was born.
The single was an un
derground hit, catching the 
eye of major labels. Wor
ried about selling out, 
Dammers decided to go 
with Chrysalis Records, 
who would distribute and
market 2 Tone. The next Special AKA/ 
single, Gangsters, reached the top ten! 
in Britain and was soon followed by$ 
Madness debut. You know Madness,; 
they sang Our House.After the single-s 
success, Madness signed with Stiff 
records, but 2 Tone continued its success 
with the Special AKA (who then changed' 
their name once again to The Specials), 
the Selecters, and The Beat.
But, as we all know, success stagnates 
after a while, and The Specials began 
fighting with each other (there were 
nine of them, after all, and with that 
many people, someones bound to get on 
your nerves). This was made worse by a 
particularly tedious U.S. tour and con
certs where audience members would 
get into fistfights  the antithesis of.1 
their message.
The Specials last single was Ghostj 
Town, and a few months later, four; 
members left to pursue different bands, j 
The remaining five reverted back to the) 
Special AKA and released more singles.* 
Their last top ten hit was the anti-! 
apartheid Nelson Mandela, which] 
pleaded for tolerance and racial har-| 
mony in South Africa.
With new songs falling quickly off the, 
charts and rivalries worsening between! 
bands, 2 Tone records called it quits ini 
1980. But its influence is still incar-: 
nated in the rude boy image and nostal
gia for The Beat, The Specials, and Mad
ness has not ceased.
The moral of the story? Theres more 
to music than commerciality, said 
Dammers. Bringing people together 
through their sounds, the second wave 
of ska traveled across the oceans and! 
reached many without even thinking ofi 
leaving its original message behind.
I remember flipping through the chan
nels and seeing the drummer from No 
Doubt wearing a Madness shirt. I was 
confused  would todays mainstream 
music audience acknowledge the 2 Tone 
principles? Had the message been lost? 
After a moment, however, I remembered 
Sting in his Beat shirt and smiled.

CMU opera enthralls audience
By ELIZABETH CURRID
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
The Magic Flute is a classic case of 
good and evil, directed by Gregory 
Lehane, an associate drama professer. 
CMUs performance of Mozarts opera 
was an immaculate fusion ofvoice, light
ing, setting, and orchestra.
The play opens on a wandering 
Tamino, played by senior music major 
Kevin Hanrahan, lost in the desert. 
Tamino has been prompted by strange 
dreams to lake a journey. This endeavor 
will lead him to a battle between good 
and evil. Symbolically, the contrast is 
revealed by characters who symbolize 
night and day: Queen Astrafiammante, 
played by Kelly Lynch, and Sarastro, 
(sophomore music major Sean Cooper), 
In Act I it seems that the queens 
daughter,Pamino(Melanie Vaccari) has 
been captured by Sarastro. Tamino has 
been instructed by the queen to save her. 
Act II soon reveals, however, that the real 
evil is in fact the queen. Eventually, it is 
not Pamino who is saved, but instead, 
Tamino, who is intiated into the righ
teous Sarastros brotherhood and mar
ries Pamino. At last, good has triumphed, 
and night and day have beer united.
-The artists and production staff did an 
amazing job in the illustration of good 
and evil through Queen Astrafiammante 
and Sarastro and their entourages. Many 
facets of the production went into clearly 
portraying the conflict, including incred
ible costume design, with Sarastro 
in white and khaki garb and the 
Queen in deep black velvet and glim
mering diamonds.
The opera itself was magnificently 
performed by director Robert Pages 
orchestra. Though I am not a con
noisseur on the technicalities of 
musical performance, I was thor
oughly impressed. As for the vocals,
I am still totally flabbergasted as to 
how Kelly Lynch managed to fluc
tuate her voice across six octaves 
without losing her breath, or her 
voice box for that matter.
As the Magic Flute progressed, I 
saw the opera singers talent as ac
tors shine through and enhance 
their performance to an exhilarat
ing level. Papageno, junior music

approximately 3000 theatres nationwide. 
Serving size: two hours, 20 minutes.
I What: Sphere 
1 Director: Barry Levinson 
I Company: Miramax
Sounds like the recipe for a great film, 
which makes Sphere that much more 
disappointing. The intelligence and 
subtle wit that Attanasio (Quiz Show) 
and Levinson (Bugsy, Rain Man) brought 
to their last adaptation of a Michael 
Crichton novel, Disclosure, is absent 
here. Instead we have a routine manmeets-alien shocker.
Perhaps one of the reasons Sphere 
fails is that its a suspense/sci-fi/horror 
film whose makers are more accustomed 
and better suited to dramas like Donnie 
Brasco, Sleepers, and Diner  movies in 
which people motivate the plot and not 
the other way around.
And the actors in Sphere are just a^' 
talented as the Wag the Dog bunch, but 
because they are given so little to work' 
with  the dialogue is often techno
speak or Whats going on?-type excla
mations  Levinson must look else^: 
where for the interesting stuff. And he 
doesnt seem to know where to find it.
Levinson seems to relish scenes in; 
which, for instance, Dustin Hoffmangives a long expository monologue, sum
marizing the plot of the film. Hoffman; 
makes the most out of it, achieving dead
pan humor, and you know Levinsons; 
having a great time watching him dd'iti,1;
But the suspense scenes move too fasti,; 
to be suspenseful. Rather, one waits for:1 
the noise and the fast cutting and the out-:, 
of-control steadicam shots to end so that" 
one of the characters can recount what: 
just happened.
Theres a lot of talk in Spheres firsts 
half-hour about humans first contact?! 
with alien life, and how mathematics; 
will be our common language, and how 
the research operation must be kept 
top secret. Just once Id like to see a 
movie about our second or fourth c,0nr;  
tact with aliens in which the govern-1 
ment is too busy with a presidentialsex scandal to notice that aliens have': 
landed in the middle of, say, Chicago." 
And the aliens cant add or substract,'' 
but they do speak Yiddish.

job, we can only guess. It prob
ably has something to do with 
yuppie-to-be Scott Thorpe (David 
Spade), who also wants the job. 
To qualify, Darryl must become a 
jock and successfully pledge a 
fraternity. But alas, our hero is 
not a finalist in the competition.
Luckily for Darryl, his hunt for 
money leads him to volunteer for 
a new study that tests the effects 
of a sense-heightening drug. 
Darryl uses his newfound super 
sense powers to wow the SmytheBates recruiters and become an 
extra finalist. But he falls for the 
obvious trap in this type of for
mula film: Darryl overdoses on 
the super-medicine. Now, with 
the most decisive days of his life 
coming up, only four of Darryls 
senses work at any one time.
Featuring both new and famil
iar faces, the supporting cast is 
strong. Hockey-playing pin cush
ion kid Matthew Lillard (the sec
ond bad guy in Scream) is Darryls 
roommate. From his piercing an
tics to his too-cute-for-words ex
pressions, Lillard entertains, 
which is all his character is asked 
to do. Spade looks out of place 
without Chris Farley, but the 
baby-faced actor fits in with the 
college crowd. Rip Torn is strong 
as a Smythe-Bates executive, but 
an unnecessary plot twist makes 
him come off as a phony. Its i n 
cases like this when two-dimensional characters are asked to carry 
the story that the movie fails.
/'Q What: Senseless 
Pas Director: P. Spheeris 
Company: Miramax
For instance, Tamara Taylor 
(Grace Wilcox from the TV series 
Party of Five) plays Darryls girl
friend. Shes cuter than Halle 
Berre, but other than sitting 
around battingher eyes at Darryl,
her character has no point. BradJ, 
Dourif, who has this fantastically.; 
average face, plays Dr. WheedonU 
Dourif is well cast, but his cKar~: 
acter is annoyingly familialin-ihe 
respect that he knows exaclty what 
will happen when his experiment 
tal drug is used on a human.' 
Wayans, whose physical comedy 
will inevitably be compared tfrln?t\ 
Living Color co-star Jim Carrfey; 
can deliver a punchline, but this;, 
nice-guy-does-good act is so simple 
and not entertaining.
Senseless falls apart in the end 
when Darryl feels, he has to re-'. 
veal his super-senses and 
Spheeris tries to tie things 
with a few feel-good scenes and-1 
references to The Jeffersons TVj; 
series. Much like Darryl, four out: 
of five pieces of this film seem to be

CARNEGIE MELLON CODE
Students at Carnegie Mellon, hccause they arc members of an academic community dedicated to the 
achievement of excellence, arc cxpectcd to meet the highest standards of personal, ethical and moral 
conduct possible.
These standards require personal integrity, a commitment to honesty without compromise, as well as 
truth without equivocation and a willingness to place the good of the community above the good of the 
self. Obligations once undertaken must be met, commitments kept.
As members of the Carnegie Mellon community, individuals are expected to uphold the standards of 
the community in addition to holding others accountable for said standards. It is rare that the life of a 
student in an academic community can be so private that it will not affect the community as a whole or 
that the above standards do not apply.
The discovery, advancement and communication of knowledge arc not possible without a 
commitment to these standards. Creativity cannot exist without acknowledgment of the creativity of 
others. New knowledge cannot be developed without credit for prior knowledge. Without the ability to 
trust that these principles will be observed, an acadcmic community cannot exist.
The commitment of its faculty, staff and students to these standards contributes to the high respect in 
which the Carnegie Mellon degree is held. Students must not destroy that respect by their failure to meet 
these standards. Students who cannot meet them should voluntarily withdraw from the university.
The Carnegie Mellon Code maintains that viola lions of community standards are taken seriously. Thu 
University Committee on Discipline (UDC) is a hearing board made up offaculty, staff and students.
The UDC hears cases of alleged serious violations of community standards and makes a 
recommendation for action if they find the student(s) to he responsible for a charge. Not all judicial 
eases are refferred to a hearing boaid. In fact, during the 96-97year 167 cases resulted in a mediated 
agreement between the student(s) and the university.
The chart below highlights select UDC cases between the Fall 1996 and Spring 1997 semesters. In 
accordance with state and federal law protecting the privacy of student records, details of eases arc 
excluded in order to prevent the clear identification of the studcnt(s) involved.

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon University  16 February 1998Lll
Veteran band excels on new disc
By ANDY FRANCIS
Tartan Staffwriter
Since the time grunge and al
ternative rock burst onto the na
tional scene in the early '90s, Pearl 
Jam have been at the forefront of 
the movement. The phenomenal 
success of their debut album, Ten, 
first pushed them into promi
nence, but since then they have 
distanced themselves from the 
commercialism of that disc, with 
their singles playing less on radio 
and never on television.
Artist: Pearl Jam 
jTitle: Yield 
Label: Sony
Since Ten, the band has released 
several solid albums, including 
Vs., Vitalogy, and last years littleheard-from No Code. They have 
faded from the public eye some
what, which makes their fifth re
lease, Yield, even more impres
sive. Although modern rock is in 
a down period, Yield manages to 
bringback the intensity and heavi
ness associated with the genre, 
while Pearl Jam itself evolves into 
a stronger group.
The first half of Yield, which 
borrows more from their more 
recent releases, features perhaps 
the bands rawest, most aggres
sive work to date. Stompers like 
the opening track, Brain of J., 
and Do the Evolution exemplify 
the explosive rock sound that has 
defined Pearl Jam, as well as 
displaying sharper, more concise 
songerait. Other tunes, such as 
The Faithful, show the band 
breaking free of alt-rock clichs, 
while Given to Fly borrows 
heavily from Led Zeppelins Go
ing to California to create a rich,
soaring song. The fuzzy guitar 
work, along with frontman Eddie 
Vedders powerful but never overthe-top vocals, creates an engross
ing sound that only occasionally 
becomes tedious.
They achieve a loose, smooth 
sound on tracks such as MFC 
without blowing the listener 
away, and Vedder provides emo
tional weight with his soaring 
choruses. The second half may 
seem musically different from the 
first, but the album maintains a 
cohesion as each song flows and 
contributes to the next.
While the songwriting on the 
album is maybe Pearl Jams fin
est, their musical flaws have 
evolved as well. Guitarists Mike 
McCready and Stone Gossard 
have retained much of their jamoriented tendencies, but operate 
more within the structure of the
songs now. Bassist Jeff Ament 
and drummer Jack Irons change i 
speeds and propel melodies eas
ily as the rhythm section.
The heart of the band still lies 
with Vedder, though. Once a tor, 
tured alt-rock hero, Vedder has ; 
adapted to the looser feel of his 
band, removing much ofthe angst 
from his lyrics and even including 
a love song or two. His voice often 
functions as another instrument.
Yield is not a perfect disc  the 
music becomes sloppy on occa
sions, and Push Me, Pull Me 
sounds fairly pretentious. How
ever, Pearl Jams evolution is re
markable, and the songs on this 
disc are quite accessible. Guitarpowered rock may be in a decline, , 
but as long as groups like Pearl 
Jam continue to push their fron
tiers and expand sonically, the 
genre will never truly be dead.International origins create unique sound
HISTORY, from page L9
international look of the genre with stark 
contrast of black and white suits, calling for 
racial unity in the face of the growing racist 
skinhead movement, and carried the music 
form into the early 1980s with the main
stream success of bands like The Specials, The 
English Beat and Madness.
In the interim between the second and 
third waves, bands such as the Toasters (play
ing a more streetwise 2 Tone blend) and 
Fishbone (blendingfunk into the mix) carried 
the torch as a fairly underground movement.
Around this time the MoonSka NYC record 
label was formed, and girded its loins for the 
next ska explosion. As the 1980s drew to a 
close, The Mighty Mighty Bosstones and their 
hybrid ska introduced a strange fascination 
with plaid clothing into the genre. The jury is 
still out on this.
In the 1990s all things ska became strange. 
New American bands began synthesizing new 
ska sounds out of every genre imaginable, cre
ating a myriad of new subcategories. Operation 
Ivy is creditied with reviving ska-punk at the 
dawn of the decade out of love of the 2 Tone
movement. Theres the Latin ska-core and 
Salska spearheaded by the Voodoo Glow 
Skulls, the pop-sensibilities of No Doubt, the 
bluesy MU330, Christian-oriented acts, flirta
tions with gangsta rap, and strange European 
experiments involving hip-hop and trance. .
So why the current mainstream fascina
tion? I think its largely because people 
want to dance, Shifrin said. Not all ska is 
cheery, but almost all of it has an infectious 
beat that people love to dance to. For this 
very reason, ska may well be around forever 
in some form or another.

From explaining werewolves to being the perfect setting 
for a romantic date, the moon has always held a place of fas
cination for people. Traditionally, the moon has been used to 
help denote the passage of time. The lunar calendar follows 
the phases of the moon regardless of the tropical year, upon 
which the Gregorian calendar is based. There is also a 
lunar-solar calendar which follows the lunar cycle but adds 
an extra month every few years to keep in sync with the 
tropical year. It has been used to explain mental states  the 
word lunatic is obviously derived from luna. At asylums, 
extra staff are called in to work during a full moon. And some 
murderers have been acquitted of charges due to the influ
ence of a full moon.
On a lighter note, the full moon is the reason that people 
under the curse of a werewolf will change into wolf form. 
Some people believe that poor dying souls under the curse 
will return as vampires. Good thing Buffy the Vampire Slayer 
is around to protect us when she isn't busy starring in mov
ies. Plus, if you decide to take her out on a date on a night 
with a full moon, you know that you don't have to worry 
about facing the creatures of the night. The last quarter of the 
moon will lead into the new moon on February 26. Beware 
of all the crazy lunatics.
