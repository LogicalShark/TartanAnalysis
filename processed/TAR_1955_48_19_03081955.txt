Rushing Ends As 70 
Pledge Tech Sororities
Seventy women students accepted bids to pledge sororities on 
Monday afternoon, February 28, as the sorority rushing period drew 
to a close. In one of the most successful rushing seasons, the 
rushees were subjected to three weeks of dinner dates and rushing 
parties. ?-----------------------------------------------
This is the third year that ReCQrd dumber

Reports Director
freshman women have been eli
gible for sorority rushing in their 
freshman year. The previous 
practice had been that a rushee 
had to be a sophomore.
A factor 'of 2.00 is necessary 
before a girl can participate in 
the rushing activities. The rush
ing is supervised by Pan-Hell 
Council, the ruling body of the 
Tech sororities.
Listed below are the sororities 
and their new pledges:

semester as pledges of those or
ganizations. If they complete their 
pledge training and make their 
grades this semester they will be 
initiated early next fall into active 
sorority membership.
Elections
An all school election for 
Student Council representa
tives is scheduled for March 
29. One representative from 
the school of Industrial Ad
ministration and one from 
Fine Arts will be elected at 
that time. Fach candidate is 
required to have a petition 
signed by at least 40 full time 
undergraduate students of the 
college he is to represent. 
These are available in the of
fice of the Dean of Men, and 
must he returned before 
March 19.
Applications for admission to 
Carnegie Tech this year have in
creased 15 per cent over the past 
year. To date, 2376 freshmen ap
plications have been received by 
Dr. John M. Daniels, Director of 
Admissions.
Last year at this, time, we had 
2077 aplications, Dr. Daniels 
said. The difference of 300 repre
sents a 15 per cent increase of 
students wishing to enter Car
negie Tech. Applications for en
rollment have been climbing 
steadily since the peak post war 
years due to the natui'al increase 
in population, greater numbers of 
high school graduates, and most 
important, a disproportionate in
crease in the number of high 
school graduates wanting the 
benefits of higher education. In 
many business organizations to
day, college degrees are essential 
to advencement and higher sal
ary, and this trend is becoming 
more marked every year.
New applicants to the College 
of Fine Arts were 34 per cent 
higher than last years figure. The 
College of Engineering and Sci
ence had a 13 per cent increase.
Unfortunately, the number . of 
new students which can actually 
be enrolled is fixed. Carnegie 
Techs facilities can only handle 
900 new students each year, in
cluding transfers.
In the department of painting 
and design, however, it is possible 
that a few more students can be 
accomodated this year, according 
to Fine Arts Dean, Norman L. 
Rice.
Rabbi S. B. Freehof 
Will Talk At Next 
Religious Meeting
Dr. Solomon B. Freehof, rabbi 
of Rodef Shalom Temple, will 
speak at the Carnegie Tech Fine 
Arts theatre, at 11:30 Tuesday 
morning, March 22.
He is the second speaker to ap
pear before the student body in 
Carnegie Techs current series of 
religious assemblies. The assem
blies are presented to give Car
negie Tech students the opportun
ity to hear outstanding clergy and 
laymen of all faiths discuss re
ligion.
The first address was given last 
month by Monsignor Paul E. 
Campbell, pastor of the. St. Law
rence Roman Catholic Church, 
who spoke on The Growth of 
Christianity.
Speakers in future assemblies 
include Dr. E. A. Loomis, psychi
atrist at Western Psychiatric In
stitute and Admiral Ben Moreell, 
Chairman of the Board, Jones & 
Laughlin Steel Corporation.

ATOs And Tri-Delts Place 
Second In Annual Contest
By Evelyn Alessio
At the culminating event of Carnegie Techs 1955 Greek Sing and Swing Festivities, 
in the Syria Mosque ballroom Saturday night a large crowd witnessed the awarding of 
trophies to the winners of Greek Sing competition held in the Carnegie Music Hall Fri
day evening.
Beta Theta *Pi fraternity, 
who took third place in the 
sing competition last year, 
came to the fore to merit the 
first place trophy Saturday 
night.
This is the fifth year that 
the Beta Theta Pis have en
tered Greek Sing with George 
Candler as their conductor. A 
graduate electrical engineer, he 
has concentrated many of his 
outside activities in choral groups 
and the Kiltie Band. The win
ners did Cave Sedem, a novelty 
number by Cain, and Give Me 
Your Tired, Your Poor by Laza
rus.
ATOs Repeat
Second place cup went to Alpha 
Tau Omega Fraternity for its 
presentation of Grass and 
Gossip. John Kestner, a sopho
more P&D student, led the ATO s 
to second place, which they also 
took last year.
Kappa Sigma, led by Marlyn 
Jakub, a freshman physics stu
dent, was awarded third place 
for There is a Flower, the fra
ternitys sweetheart song, and 
The Battle of Jericho.
For the fourth consecutive year 
Kappa Kappa Gamma was award
ed the first place competition cup. 
Led by Janet Jerles, a sophomore 
home economics student who had 
had little experience in choral 
direction, the Kappas did Snow 
Legend and Finale Friday 
night.
Tri Delts Second
Delta Delta Delta, who did 
The Nightingale and Ride the 
Chariot, took the second place 
trophy. Thei. conductor was Mar
ilyn Mitchell, a senior music stu
dent, and Mary Birch was their 
soloist.
Placing in the top three for the 
second consecutive year, Delta 
Gamma was awarded the third 
place competition cup by Molly 
Rudy, Pan-Hellenic co-chairman 
for the weekend festivities who 
made the sorority presentations. 
Delta Gamma was led by Anne 
Elder, a sophomore music ma
jor, in their presentation of As 
Torrento in Summer and Pester, 
Peter, Pumpkin Eater.
Jerry Lessmann, co-chairman 
of this years Greek Sing and 
Swing, made the fraternity pres
entations during intermission.

Carnegie Professors Discover 
New Liquid Semiconductor
A liquid has been ofund that behaves electrically like a solid 
semiconductor.
Th ebest known example of semiconduction in a solid is the 
transistor, a new electronic device replacing the vacuum tube in
national defense and industrial#-------------:---------------------------------------
electronic equipment and also
making possible very small port
able radios. The transistor made 
of solids like germanium or sili
con, conducts electronically rather 
than ionically as in a battery and 
the amount of conductance in
creases.
Now this same phenomenon of 
semiconduction has been found in 
liquids  molten metallic sul
fides  at Techs Metals Research 
Laboratory. The discovery was 
made by Drs. G. M. Pound and 
Gerhard Derge as they worked 
on an Atomic Energy Commission 
project dealing with electro
chemical studies of non-aqueous 
melts.
In the case of ordinary salts 
such as sodium chloride, either 
molten or in a water solution, 
electrical current is carried by 
ions, as in a battery. Exploring 
less familiar liquids such as thbse 
used in metallurgical processes, 
the Carnegie Tech professors un
covered more than they had 
hoped. The molten liquid sulph
ides, unlike aqueous solutions or 
molten ionic salts, behaved like 
a semi-conductor. Instead of con
duction electricity by the trans
port of charged atoms (ionical
ly), it conducted electricity by the 
flow of electrons as in an ordin
ary wire. But unlike ordinary 
metals, the conductance increased 
with temperature.
In a joint statement, the Car
negie Tech metallurgists said, 
Much of the information that 
can be obtained from customary 
solutions at room temperature is 
already known.
Carnegie Chorus 
Concert March 23
The chorus and orchestra of the 
Carnegie Tech music department 
will present a. concert Wednes
day, March 23, with music rang
ing in mood from the calm and 
resigned acceptance of death to 
the celebration of lifes joys.
Under the baton of conductor 
Roland Leich, Associate Profes
sor of Music, the choral group and 
orchestra will begin somberly 
with Requiem, Opus, 48, a com
position written for the church by 
Gabriel Faure.
Cocalise, written by Nikolai 
Lopotnikoff resident professor of 
music here at Tech, for the Pitts
burgh International Contemporary 
Music Festival in 1952, will be the 
second offering. Lopotnikoffs 
wistful composition will be fol
lowed with an A Copella Chorus 
rendition of two Arnold Bax 
pieces, This Worlds Joie, which 
imparts a tragic and rebellious 
spirit against death, and I Sing 
of a Maiden That is Makeless, 
a lighter and more joyous piece, 
whose theme dates from AngloSaxon days.
The Snow and Fly, Singing 
Bird by Edward Edgar complete 
the transition from somberness 
and melancholy to the joys and 
vibrance of life. The program 
c o n eludes with Beethovens 
Choral Fantasia, Opus 80.-an exhilirating composition which has 
never before been heard by a 
Pittsburgh audience.

Master Builders Assn 
To Give Scholarships
Scholarships valued at $500 each, will be awarded by the Master 
Builders Association of Western Pennsylvania to the two most de
serving civil engineering students at the University of Pittsburgh and 
Carnegie Tech, it was announced today by William C. Bowden, sec
retary of the association. ?
Available to both male and fe
male students who have com
pleted their sophomore studies in 
civil engineering, the scholarships 
will be awarded on the basis of 
scholastic achievement, profes
sional promise, financial need, and 
personal qualifications. Eligibility 
will be limited to students whose 
homes are in the 11-county West
ern Pennsylvania area, embracing
Most of the 12 fraternities on 
campus have elected officers to 
serve for the spring semester 
term. Although some of the elec
tions have not been held yet, fol
lowing is a complete list of the 
present presidents and social Allegheny, Armstrong, B u 11 e r, j chairmen:

The winner of the scholarship 
assigned to Carnegie Tech will be 
selected by a committee headed 
by Dr. Webster N. Jones, vicepresident, and Carnegie faculty 
members Dr. B. R. Teare, Jr., 
Dean of the College of Engineer
ing and Sciences; Dr. F. T. Mavis, 
head of the department of civil en
gineering; and Dr. D. F. Miner, 
Director of Student Personnel and 
Welfare.
At Pitt the winner will be se
lected by a committee headed by 
Prof. Robert F. Edgar, assistant 
dean of the Schools of Engineer
ing and Mines.
Mr. Bowden today said that 
both scholarships will cover the 
1955-56 academic year, beginning 
with the September term. He add
ed that the association will award 
two new scholaships each year 
thereafter.
In announcing the scholarships 
the Master Builders Association 
declared that its purpose is to en
courage both college and high 
school students to give serious 
consideration to the building in
dustry as a life-time career and 
to assist worthy students in pre
paring for such a career.
Mr. Bowden said: The Pitts
burgh redevelopment program in 
which our members have played 
such an active role points up the 
importance of the building indusi 
try and the wealth of opportunity 
it offers to young men and wom
en with the proper technical 
training. Major advances in buildI 
ing techniques over the past sev
eral years make it imperative that 
the industry recruit more gradu
ate civil engineers. We also would 
like to underline the importance 
of civil engineering to high 
school students and urge them to . 
study subjects which will prepare 
them for entry into civil engineer; 
ing schools.

originally to serve as National 
Boys Work secretary, a job which 
took him over what are now the 
independant nations of India, 
Burma, Pakistaan and Ceylon. 
During World War II he contri
buted to the War Emergency 
Service conducted by the Indian 
YMCA, the service which set up 
225 centers serving Indian, Afri
ca nand British forces in India.
A native of Ottawa, Canada, Mr. 
Dunderdale is a graduate of the

Playhouse Sets 
Schedule For 
Spring Months
The Pittsburgh Playhouse has 
set its schedule of plays through 
the end of May.
Currently holding forth in the 
Playhouses Hamlet Street thea
ter is the Sidney Howard comedy 
The Late Christopher Bean. 
This delightfully funny commen
tary on modem art will continue 
to run at Pittsburghs Community 
Theater through March 12.
Next on the agenda is the Ar
thur Miller drama, The Cru
cible, which will have its first 
Pittsburgh showing at the Play
house. Miller, author of the Pul
itzer Prize play Death of a 
Salesman, has written this new 
play dealing with the Salem witch 
hunt of the 1600s. The Cruci
ble will open a three week run 
on March 10 in the Craft Ave
nue theater.
Then on March 24, the Play
house will present another Broad
way hit for the first time in the 
Pittsburgh area. This is a comedy 
entitled The Little Nut, and a 
play that broke all records in 
London and had a successful New 
York stay last year.
On April 14, back in the Craft 
Avenue theater of the Playhouse, 
it will be musical revue time 
again. This year the Playhouse is 
presenting a bright revue entitled 
The Lighter Side.
Another first for the Playhouse 
is The Caine Mutiny Court Mar
tial which is having its first offBroadway production at the local 
Community theater. The Caine 
Mutiny Court Martial will tour 
to communities within a 50 miles 
radius beginning April 12 and will 
open at the Playhouse in Pitts
burgh on April 28.

THE CARE AND FEEDING OF BOOKS
You busy college people  you with your classes and your 
studying and your social activities and your three-legged races  
it is no wonder that you have so little time for reading. I mean 
reading for the pure pleasure of it, not to cram for exams. It is 
a sad omission, and my heart goes out to you. I do, however, 
take comfort from the fact that the graduation season ap
proaches. Many of you will soon leave the hurly-burly of college 
for the tranquility of the outside world. Oh, youll love it on 
the outside! It is a quiet life, a gracious and contemplative 
life, a life of ease and relaxation, of plenty of time to enjoy the 
treasures of literature.
It is with you in mind that I sit now in my cane-bottomed 
rocker and close my kindly gray eyes and smoke a mellow 
Philip Morris cigarette and remember books that made me 
laugh and books that made me cry and, remembering, laugh and 
cry again. It is, I say, with you in mind that I sit thus and 
rock thus and close my kindly gray eyes thus and smoke a 
Philip Morris thus and laugh and cry thus, for I wish to recom
mend these lovely and affecting books to you so that you too may 
someday sit in your cane-bottomed rockers and close your kindly 
gray eyes and smoke a mellow Philip Morris and remember 
books that made you laugh and books that made you cry and, 
remembering, laugh and cry again.
Sitting and rocking, my limpid brown eyes closed in reverie, 
a plume of white smoke curling lazily upward from my excellent 
Philip Morris cigarette, I remember a lovely and affecting 
book called Blood on the Grits by that most talented young 
Southerner, Richard Membrane Haw\ It is a tender and poignant 
story of a sensitive Alabama boy who passes safely through 
puberty only to be devoured by boll weevils ... A lovely and 
affecting book.
I puff my splendid Philip Morris cigarette and close my danc
ing blue eyes and recall another book, a thrilling true adventure, 
lovely and affecting, called / Climbed Everest the Hard Way 
by Cliff Sherpa. Mr. Sherpa, as everyone knows, was the first 
man to reach the peak of Mt. Everest by tunneling from below. 
In his book he gives a lovely and affecting account of his trip, 
which was not as easy as it sounds, you may be sure.
I light another merry Philip Morris cigarette and close my 
lambent hazel eyes and recollect another book  Life on the Farm 
by Dick Woolly. This is a short book  only 55 words  and 
rather a dull one. It would not be worth mentioning here were 
it not for the fact that the author is a sheep.
I exhale a cloud of snowy white smoke from my bracing Philip 
Morris cigarette and shut my laughing green eyes and think 
of the vast, vast array of historical novels that have given 
me pleasure.
There is Blood on the Visor by Richard Membrane Haw (he 
who wrote the lovely and affecting Blood on the Grits). There 
is Cold Steel and Hot Flashes by Emmaline Prentiss Moulting. 
There is The Black Shield of Sigafoos by Wruth Wright. There 
is Four Quarts in a Galleon by William Makepiece Clambroth. 
There are many, many others, all lovely, all affecting.
But sitting here, drawing on my matchless Philip Morris 
cigarette, my saucy amber eyes closed tightly, I am thinking 
that the loveliest, most affecting of all historical novels is May 
Fusters classic, I Was a Serf for the F.B.I. Mrs. Fuster, justly 
famed for her rich historical tapestries, has outdone herself 
in this tempestuous romance of Angela Bodice, fiery daughter 
of an entailed fief, who after a great struggle rises to the lofty 
position of head-linesman to the Emperor of Bosnia and then 
throws it all away to leacLthe downtrodden peasants in a revolt 
against the mackerel tax. She later becomes Ferdinand Magellan.
But the list of fine books is endless, as you will soon discover 
who are about to leave the turmoil of the campus and iter into 
the serene world outside, where a man has time to read and rock 
and close his rakish taupe eyes and smoke good Philip Morris 
cigarettes.Max Shultnan, 1955
7 hr makers of Philip Morris, tvho bring you this column, tell you 
that in our book, PHILIP MORRIS is the mildest, tastiest cigarette 
anybody ever made.
New Grants 
Given To Tech
Atlas Powder Company, manu
facturer of explosives, chemicals, 
activated carbons and industrial 
finishes, will award eight $1,000 
college scholarships again this 
year, Ralph K. Gottschall, presi
dent, has announced.
The grants will go to students 
who will be seniors during the 
1955-56 college year, majoring in 
chemistry or any branch of engi
neering, in 38 outstanding colleges 
and universities, including Car
negie Tech.
Last year, the first year that 
the scholarships were offerd, over 
160 applicants were screened be
fore the eight winners were se
lected.
Mr. Gottshall said that the 
awards are part of the companys 
program to enable outstanding 
students to complete their scien
tific education, in order to meet 
some of industrys pressing needs 
for technical personnel.
The program will be adminis
tered by the Atlas committee on 
scholarships, headed by Dr. 
Thomas Kennedy, the companys 
director of industrial and public 
relations.
Scholarships will be awarded on 
the basis of scholastic records and 
the recommendations of faculty 
members who are acquainted with 
the applicants. Extra-curricular 
activities and financial need will 
also be factors.
The grants will be used to pay 
tuition, board, travel and other 
senior year costs, as approved by 
the students college.
Winners of the awards will be 
announced May 15.
Successful candidates also will 
have a chance to gain practical 
experience by summer work be
tween their junior and senior 
years, either in one of Atlas 12 
plants and three research labora
tories or with an Atlas technical 
field representative.
Pay for summer work will be 
in addition to the $1,000 scholar
ship. However, successful candi
dates will not be obligated to work 
for Atlas either during the sum
mer or after graduation, nor will 
Atlas assume any commitment to 
employ the student.

When the curtain rises at Syria 
Mosque on Thursday evening, 
March 17 at 8:15 p.m., it will usher 
in the final performances for the 
1954-55 season of the Pittsburgh 
Opera. Chosen for this finale of

Editorial
Whose To Blame?
What is the cause for the lack of student 
interest in campus activities? Lately, this 
question has come up increasingly in al
most all of Carnegies student organizations 
and societies, particularly with regard to the 
small number of sophomores and freshmen 
who seem willing to devote some of their  
time to activities outside the scope of their I 
regular school work.
In most cases, the blame can be equally 
divided among the student, the organization, 
and external circumstances. We cannot say 
that students are just not interested or j 
that they are a bunch of bookworms; these ! 
are more the effects of the situation than 
the causes.
Many students do not realize until too 
late that there is more to a college education ; 
than calculus and shorthand. By actively!
engaging in extracurricular activities, the -----V
student learns to work with others, to re
spect the ideas and opinions of those who 
differ with him, and to solve problems in 
human relations and organization which 
never occur during regular school hours, j 
Potential employers recognize the valuable 
experience to be gained from membership 
in campus activities and place a great deal 
of emphasis on this phase of college achieve

ment when they select men for their organizations.
If a student fails to recognize the value of campus activi
ties while it is still early in his college career, it is rarely 
that any transformation will take place later. In a few in
stances yes, but in many cases the individual sees those of 
his classmates who did become interested earlier rising to 
positior* of responsibility within the various organizations, 
and he decides that it will be of little value to him to join 
since he couldnt go very far.
But much of the criticism should be directed toward the 
organizations themselves. Too often, urgent requests are 
made for members ,the hopefuls appear, and then they com
pletely ignored because nobody takes the time or effort to 
make them useful and necessary members of the group. 
After a few /nonths of inactivity the new members soon 
lose all interest and either quit or become members in name
communter student whose classes are over 
at 11:30 will wait till 4:30 to attend a meeting 
or social affair. Then too, the dues in some 
honoraries are so high as to discourage many 
potential members.
What is needed is (1) increased wareness 
on the part of students of benefits to be 
gained from activities, and (2) an examina
tion on the part of many organizations of 
their training of new members and of the 
condition of the organization itself. Easy 
words to say, but a little harder to put into 
action.

There are, in addition, conditions external to the activi

Over The 
Skibo Table
By Joseph A. Szewc
Peace reigns once again in Morewood Gardens. 
Sorority rushing is over for another semester and 
the sorority girls no longer tape up their smiles at 
night. The falsity of it all is finished and the 
pledges wear their dinks and pins proudly, accept 
their congratulations graciously, and defend their 
new found sisters loyally. There is work to be done. 
The sorority must 'be propigated for all eternity, 
etc. say the neophytes. Enthusiasm can certainly 
be found in all the new pledge classes.
But in the hearts of a handful of other girls can 
be found emotions of a different nature. I speak of 
| those girls who were cut by the sorority they 
wanted to join, the girls who were not rushed at 
all by their favorite group, or, worse still, the girls 
who were rushed but received an empty bid 
envelope.
I sat in my car at the corner of Devor\ Road and 
Forbes right near the Union and watched the mixed 
emotions of the girls as they clutched the small 
white envelopes and waJked alone or in a group to 
the gai'dens. Those girls that walked alone in many 
cases were shedding tears or had looks of dis
appointment on their faces. All in all, I sat for an 
hour and counted ten or 12 girls crying. However, I 
imagine that all those who did not look sad were

I went up to the Scot office the other day to do 
a little research. After digging through a mess of 
exchange issues and old Scots, I came up with 
absolutely nothing except two half decent limer
icks. And here they are:
There was a young girl in Australia,
Who went to a dance as a dahlia.
When the petals uncurled,
They revealed to the world 
r That as clothing the dress a failure.
There was a young girl named Anheuser 
Who said that no man could surpriser 
But Pabst took a chance 
Found the girl at her Aunts 
And now she is adder budweiser.
* * *
In conclusion let me remind you: A pessimist is 
a man who feels that all women are bad. An 
optimist just hopes so.

Tartans Upset As 
Rockets Win 8F-71
Fieler Sets Field Goal Record; 
Season Ends With 13-11 Record
Taking a page l ight from Techs own book, the Rockets from 
Slippery Rock ended their season, and Techs with the districts 
biggest upset of the year, drubbing the Scots 85-71.
Tho Rockets came to the Skibo gym sporting an unimpressive
5-11 record, and with a crowd of*-------  ------- -
hometown folks who spurred them ! 
on. They took an early lead and j 
never gave it up, leading by as \ 
much as 16 points in the first half. I 
The Tartans crept close twice in 
the second half, within six points 
of the lead, the last time was with 
five minutes to play, but the 
ets managed to slip out and 
tain the lead.
Rockets Hot in First Half 
Using a three-two zone,
Rockets were able to hold the 
tans in Check while their sharp
shooters went to work and hit an 
amazing 71 per cent in the first 
half, while Tech was hitting for 
only 43 per cent. With it all Slip
pery Rock only led at the half 
42-35, with Tech getting stronger 
as the half ended.

The second half began with bad 
passing and sloppy ball-handling 
on the part of Tech, and generally 
was a repetition of the first half, 
as the Rockets tenaciously hung 
on to the lead. Though they did 
have some help from the referees, 
sinking 19 free throws during this 
period when they only scored 44 
points.
But it must be said that the 
Rockets played a heads up game, 
were alert on defense, and didnt 
miss very often on. their shots.

ers as was the rest  of the team. 
They also forced Tech to play a 
sloppy game, and its too bad that 
bad refereeing had to tarnish their 
effort.

Mel Cratsley 
Coach of the Year
- * * *
Coach Of Year 
To Cratsley; 
Fieler Honored
Last Saturday, the Pittsburgh 
Press presented its annual all
district college basketball team 
and picked its district coach of 
the year.
This year the award went to 
Techs Mel Cratsley for the out
standing job he did with the 
Tartans. Though their record was 
a not too impressive 13-11 never
theless they proved to be the 
stumbling block for their much 
more highly noted opponents more 
than once. Such titans as Penn 
State, West Virginia, Geneva, 
Westminster and Pitt fell before 
the Speedy Scots.
Cratsley took over the coaching 
reins in 1949. and thus far, his 
record for the six seasons that he 
has piloted the club is a respect
able 72 wins and 65 losses.
Named to the second team on 
the all-district all-stars was Tech's 
Dick Fieler, the one-handed push 
shot artist. This is quite an honor 
when one considers that the first 
team was composed of Ricketts, 
Green, Stokes, Amelle, and Hund<- 
ley.
Mermen Lose 
As Bill Aiken 
Sets Sivim Mark
Ending their season last Tues
day, the Tartan mermen went 
down to defeat at Meadville, as 
Allegheny^ College swamped Tech 
44-31.
Competing his last intercol
legiate swimming meet, Bill Aik
en again, as in the previous four 
meets, broke a pool record in the 
200 yard breast stroke event and 
lowered his own personal record, 
the time to 2.32.3. This makes a 
total of 10.2 seconds that Aiken 
has cut ffom his time in a period 
of less than three weeks, and he 
ended his college career on a high 
note.
Allegheny Too Strong
With a show of strength, the 
tool; five of the seven in
dividual firsts, while they split 
the relays with the Tartan mer
men, Tech winning the 400 yard 
relay, and losing their specialty, 
the 300 yard medley relay. Techs 
individual firsts were in the 60 
yard dash, which Mike Litch won 
in the time of :31.1, and Bill Aik
ens record breaking effort.
Seasons End
The loss to Allegheny ended 
the seasons schedule for the mer
men, who were much more suc
cessful than had been anticipated. 
They improved enough to reverse 
last years record of three wins 
and seven losses, ending this 
year with eight wins and three 
losses. The improvement sfems 
from the addition to the team of 
a number of very promising 
freshmen who will return next 
year to improve upon this years 
record.

wayside. Five records in all were 
broken, with Tech setting a new 
meet recorf1 for the 300 yard

the meet, with Allegheny second; 
both were conquerors of Tech

ITS EASY TO SEE that the Droodle above is titled:

taste better to all sorts of people. College smokers, 
for instance, prefer Luckies to all other brands, ac
cording to the latest, greatest coast-to-coastest college 
survey. Again, the No. 1 reason for Luckies wide lead: 
Luckies taste better. They taste better, 
first of all, because Lucky Strike means 
fine tobacco. Then, that tobacco is 
toasted to taste better. "It's Toasted

Loses Rematch
To W&J. 17-8 |
The Tartans six man fencing 
team was defeated by W&J in a 
twenty-five round rematch at 
W&J on February 26. 17-8. Both 
teams showed considerable im
provement since the first match 
which was won by W&J. 19-6.
The Tech team was organized in 
November 1954 and is lacking in j 
experience, which is essential in 
the development of an accomplis ;hed fencer. Sabre and epee 
have been dropped from the 
matcnes fenced thus far because 
the coach, George Peppard, has 
been unable to give instructions 
on these weapons in the short 
time the team has been together.
Mr. Peppard hopesto include
sabre and epee inthelater

At a match played Sunday at 
the Delta Upsilon house the Sigma 
Alpha Epsilon bridge team was 
crowned campus champs as they 
defeated the DUs, 10-6.
At the half-way mark the score 
was 5-3 but the second round 
found DU rallying to knot the 
score at 6-6. Taking the last four 
hands the visiting SAEs won pull
ing away.
The winning team was com
posed of Bill Sick, Costa George, 
Warren Schmidt, and S. Dave Colborn.
Record
At the faculty and evening 
students swim on January 26, 
Walter Timpe, a visiting re
search engineer in the metal
lurgy department, swam three 
lengths of the pool under wa
ter. This feat was performed 
under the supervision of Mr. 
J. B. Bidwell, who watched 
the visiting youth from Berlin, 
Germany, swim 225 feet under 
water without taking a breath.
[Continued from page 5]
Fieler Sets Record
On the brighter side of the pic
ture was the one-hand shooting of 
the amazing Dick Fieler, who set a 
field goal record of 16 last Wed
nesday night, 11 of them coming 
in the second half. This eclipsed 
the old mark of 13, set *by Mike 
Theodore against Grove City in 
the 1948-49 season. As one of the 
sports-writers said of him, He 
wouldnt shoot with two hands, if 
he had three!
Season Record at 13-11
With the end of the Slippery 
Rock game, the Tartans ended the 
1954 season with a 13-11 record, 
which is much better than most 
people thought it would be, for 
the Speedy Scots had a killer 
of a schedule. Yet the Tartans 
managed to come out of it with a 
winning season, by beating Penn 
State, which is headed for the 
NCAA; West Virginia, winner of 
the Southern Conference title and 
headed for the NIT or the NCAA; 
and Geneva, Pennsylvanias rep
resentative in the NAIA. Not to 
mention the whippings that Tech 
handed Westminster (and on their 
own court) and the Pitt Panthers.

Helpful Hints 
For Mid-Term
Examinations
As a view toward orientating 
students taking liberal arts 
courses, the following samples of 
questions usually sprung on the 
unsuspecting student during mid
term exams, are hereby offered as 
a guide.
First, we shall define some of 
the terms used in exam instruc
tions: Explain briefly: An ab
breviation for explain briefly 
and youll get a C. In answer
ing, be sure to include everything 
which the reader might possibly 
consider relevant. Hour Exam: 
Three hours of work to be com
pleted in one hour. Evaluate: 
Give the instructors opinion. 
Trace the evolution of: Write 
a complete history. Discuss: tell 
everything you know. Be Spe
cific: Quote the instructor or
text verbatim. Define your 
terms: The meaning of any word 
of more than one syllable should 
be carefully explained.
Now that you completely un
derstand the exam instructions, 
lets get on with the quiz.
The night was warm and 
mellow
The stars were mystically 
profound.
Her dress was silk and 
yellow
Except :or the breeze, no 
sound.
Analyze the above verse, being 
sure to answer the following ques
tions: What is the poet trying to 
do? What mood does he wish to 
capture? What is the meaning of 
mystically profound? What is 
the .significance of the breeze? 
Why use silk instead of rayon? 
Why is there no sound? What is 
the relationship between was in 
line 1 and was in line 3?
2a. A recent observer states 
that Shakespeare is full of 
cliches. Do you agree? Why? 
Do you disagree? Why?
2b. When Lady Macbeth says, 
Out, damned Spot, why does 
she want the dog to leave?
Dont destroy this. Mid-term 
exams are coming soon.
Remorsefully yours,

On Sunday evening, February 
27, Phi Gamma Pi sorority held 
a dinner for their new pledges. 
Many of the girls turned out/for 
this affair, some of whom were: 
Kathy Galligan, Emily Muhic, 
Ellen Gonter, Gini Ross, Audrey 
Wiskow, LaVerne Manion and 
Marilyn Darrah. Theresa Defino, 
Lorraine Stahle, and Lillian Staub 
were hostesses for the pledge din
ner. The menu consisted of ham, 
escalloped potatoes, baked beans, 
tossed salad , ice cream and 
cookies.
The activities of Phi Gamma Pi 
are devoted primarily to foster
ing friendship among women eve
ning students through social func
tions.
There is no limit to the good

care who gets credit for it.
During the past few weeks, a 
number of day and evening stu
dents have been very generous 
in their praises for Audrey Wis
kow, a book store employee, who 
has been most helpful to stu
dents by aiding them on their se
lections of text books and class
room material. Audreys position 
as a cashier is one in which she 
takes pride in performing to the
best of her ability, and her serv
ices, freely rendered, have been 
many and diverse. During a lull 
| in business, she will give indi; v.idual attention to ^perplexed 
I students who are not familiar 
| with the location of the various 
| texts, drawing material, etc. Her 
! gracious and efficient manner has 
eased many a perplexed stu
dents mind.
Orchids to you, Audrey. The 
recognition for your many grate
ful services is long overdue, but, 
nevertheless, deeply appreciated. 
There are few, of any, jobs 
in which ability alone is 
sufficient. You need loyal
ty, sincerity, enthusiasm 
and team play.
During the recent flu epidemic, 
a fair number of evening students 
were missing from work and 
classes. But leave it to our Kathy 
Galligan to come up with some
thing different. Last Friday, a 
telephone call was received in the 
Plaid office saying that she 
was confined to home with the 
measles. Arent you getting a 
little old for this, Kathy??? Ser
iously though, we hope that her 
recovery is rapid and complete. 
The place wont be the same until 
Chatter-box returns to liven up 
the office.

The first Lenten lecture spon
sored by the Newman Club was
held on Sunday evening, Febru

tive and enjoyed by all those 
present. There were many new 
faces that evening and it is hoped 
there will be more new ones dur
ing the coming weeks. These lec
tures are open to all who would 
desire to attend. It is not neces
sary to be a Newman Club mem

Donald C. Pote asks:
What bearing 
would my field 
of training have 
on my assignments 
at DuPont?
DONALD C. POTE will receive his T3.S. degree in Mechanical 
Engineering from Princeton University this June. Hes been 
quite active in interclub athleticsfootball, basketball and 
baseballand served a term as Club Athletic Director. Hes 
also found time to work on "The Princeton Engineer as Asso
ciate Editor. Right now, Don is making thorough plans for his 
employment after graduation.
ChuckNoren answers:
CHARLES H. NOREN received his B.S. in Min
ing Engineering from the University of North 
Dakota before he entered the U. S. Air Force. 
Later he returned to school for an M.S. from the 
Missouri School of Mines, received in 1948. Dur
ing the course of his Du Pont employment, Chuck 
Ncren has had a wide variety of job assign
ments. At present he is engaged in a fundamen
tal research project concerned with commercial 
explosives at Du Ponts Eastern Laboratory in 
Gibbstown, N. J.

The answer to that is easy, Don, if you mean initial assign
ments. Generally speaking, a graduates first assignment is 
influenced by his previous training and his expressed interest 
in a particular type of work. Whenever possible, Du Pont 
assigns a man to the type of work he is trained for and wants 
hell do better in any field if hes highly interested. For 
example, my masters thesis was on the use of explosives, 
and my first Du Pont assignment was a study of the effi
ciency of explosives. ,
But experience on the job really constitutes new training. 
You learn about other branches of science and engineering 
you broaden your horizons through daily contacts with 
men having other skills. The result is that arbitrary divi
sions between technical branches gradually dissolve, and 
you become ready for new assignments and new responsi
bilitieseven outside your original field. In my own case, I 
developed quite a bit of skill in mechanical and civil engi
neering techniques when I was called upon to supervise the 
"shooting of an experimental tunnel for the evaluation of 
new explosiveseven though my original training was in 
mining engineering.
Of course, specialization in a definite field may be con
tinued if the man specifically wants it and reveals a talent 
for it. The best opportunities for that are in research and 
development. Naturally, the value of this kind of work is 
also recognized at Du Pont.
So, no matter what your initial assignment may be, Don, 
Du Pont is anxious to bring out your best. A good rule to 
remember is this. A graduates first assignment is often nec
essarily based on his field of training and his degree, but his 
subsequent progress at Du Pont is always based on his dem
onstrated ability.

Igor Stravinsky 
To Guest-Conduet 
Symphony Friday
A double-barrelled treat is in 
store for district music lovers this 
Friday night and Sunday after
noon at Syria Mosque. Igor Stra
vinsky, world-renowned composer, 
will guest-conduct the Pittsburgh 
Symphony Orchestra in two of his 
own compositions, Scenes de 
Ballet and Petrouchka, and 
two string serenades by Mozart 
and Tschaikovsky.
Stravinsky has long been a 
leader in the development of new 
musical ideas to be identified with 
20th-century music. Bom in Rus
sia, his early compositions at
tracted the attention of Sergei 
Diaghilev, who was then organ
izing his Ballet Russe in Paris. 
Diaghilev commissioned Stravin
sky to write a ballet on the sub
ject of the Russian fairy tale, The 
Firebird, which was produced in 
Paris in 1910. This was followed 
by his other two most famous 
ballets, Petrouchka, which he 
will conduct this weekend, and 
Le Sacre du Printemps, re
cently recorded by the Pittsburgh 
Symphony Orchestra and William 
Steinberg for Capitol records.

Unexpected Entertainment 
An unexpected highlight of 
Friday nights competition was 
the Delta Tau Delta fraternity 
presentation of The Nightmare, 
an original Greek Chorus type 
composition written by Daniel 
Walker, a Delta Tau Delta mem
ber and third year dramatic 
student. Spoken, rather than sung, 
the composition provided a bit of
omic relief in the evening's pro
gram.
Greek Sing and Swing is pre
sented annually on the Tech cam
pus by the Council of Fraternity 
Presidents and the Pan-Hellenic 
Council. Judging of the sing com
petition this year was done by 
Gustav J. Kaletch, a voice in
structor at Tech, Russell Wichmann, head of the department of 
music at Pennsylvania College for 
Women, Ferdinand Fillion, di
rector of Fillion Studios, and 
Dallmeyer Russell, director of 
the Pittsburgh Musical Institute.

Since these early bollets, Stra
vinsky has given the world his 
fresh approach to music in almost 
every conceivable form, from inti
mate chamber sonatas to operas.
Shortly after his initial associa
tion with Diaghilev, Stravinsky 
left Russia to live in Switzerland 
and later France. He came to 
America in 1939 to assume the 
Elliott Norton Lectureship at Har
vard University for one year, and 
has been a resident of California 
since 1940.
In 1952, his pioneering spirit 
was paid great tribute at the 
Works of the 20 th Century 
Festival in Paris. He wos on hand 
to receive the enthusiastic cheers 
of the Paris audiences as Pierre 
Monteux conducted the Boston 
Symphony in his Le Sacre du 
Printemps, which Monteux had 
conducted in its premiere per
formance at the same Paris theater 
some 39 years before, precipita
ting a riot of disapproval.
Stravinsky will be returning to 
Pittsburgh after an absence of 15 
years.
