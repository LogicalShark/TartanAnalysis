In a visit that reinforced the 
themes of President Barack 
Obamas recent State of the 
Union address, U.S. Secretary 
of Commerce John Bryson 
spoke in the Gates Center last 
Wednesday morning to a room 
of about 60 invited guests. 
Brysons remarks focused on 
innovation in manufacturing 
and restoring Americas manufacturing competitiveness in 
the world economy.
Much of Brysons time was 
spent describing his goals 
as commerce secretary. He 
stressed that, to get results, 
you prioritize and prioritize 
ruthlessly ... you have to be 
very focused. 
Bryson laid out his three 
top priorities: advanced manufacturing, exporting, and 
encouraging investment in the 
U.S. These three categories 
are complementary. 
Bryson said that the U.S. 
must enforce trade rules in 
other countries. When American businesses compete on 
a level playing ? eld, American businesses almost always 
win. 
Entrepreneurship was a 
central theme of Brysons visit. 
One of our special traits as 
Americans that really is in contrast to substantially all the advanced ... countries elsewhere 
in the world is the extent to 
which we are entrepreneurs, 
he said. We break the norm 
and ? nd ways to get to new 
places, new technologies, new 
things to be done. 
Although Brysons remarks 
were the focus of Wednesdays 
event, Pittsburgh Mayor Luke 
Ravenstahl and Carnegie Mellon Vice President for Research 
Rick McCullough also spoke 
about the economic opportunities available in Pittsburgh. 
McCullough highlighted the 
universitys success in commercializing research projects, calling the Gates Center 
an innovation engine.
Every day our students 
and faculty are creating new 
innovations here that lead to 
new jobs, McCullough said. 
According to the university, 
Carnegie Mellon faculty and 
students start 1520 new companies every year.
The event included a panel 
of three Pittsburgh entrepreneurs who spoke about their 
experiences creating and supporting small businesses in 
western Pennsylvania.
Among the panelists was 
Scott Pearson, the CEO of 
Aquion Energy, whose headquarters Bryson had toured 
earlier Wednesday morning. 
Aquion Energy is a Carnegie 
Mellon spinoff that is commercializing battery technology based on research by Jay 
Whitacre, an assistant professor of engineering and public 
policy as well as materials science and engineering.
The other panelists were 
Rich Lunak  president and 
CEO of Innovation Works, a 
startup incubator  and Lalit 
Chordia, the president and 
founder of Thar Technologies, 
Inc., which develops supercritical ? uid technology.
Brysons visit to Carnegie 
Mellon was part of a larger trip 
to Pittsburgh. 
In addition to his time at 
the university and his visit to 
Aquion Energy, Bryson met 
with members of the Pittsburgh District Export Council and other Department of 
Commerce representatives in 
the area. 
A lot of times a Carnegie 
Mellon visit will be part of 
a bigger plan and agenda 
to bring someone to the 
region, said Tim McNulty, 
Carnegie Mellons associate 
vice president for government 
relations. 
That was the case with 
Secretary Bryson. He was in 
Pittsburgh focusing on manufacturing and focusing on 
export development.... The 
Carnegie Mellon component 
was added to the agenda, McNulty said.
Although Brysons visit is 
the ? rst in 2012 by a prominent government of? cial, several more are likely to come. 
In 2008, the last presidential 
election year, we were one of 
the few, if not the only, campus 
to have both major presidential candidates give a policy 
address  not just rallies, but 
policy addresses on campus, 
McNulty said. 
The Of? ce of Government 
Relations has invitations open 
to all the Republican candidates for the 2012 nomination 
to come to campus. 
The last few years have 
been a great period for having high-pro? le public visitors, McNulty said. Thats all 
driven by the faculty and the 
students.

Student Affairs held an 
open forum last Wednesday 
to discuss the controversy 
over one of the winning essays of the annual Martin 
Luther King Jr. Day writing 
contest.
The essay, written by Winchester Thurston High School 
junior Jesse Lieberfeld, is 
titled Fighting a Forbidden 
Battle: How I Stopped Covering Up for a Hidden Wrong. 
The essay tells the story of 
how Lieberfeld came to believe that Israel is an oppressor in the Israeli-Palestinian 
con? ict, and of how that 
belief has affected his life. It 
draws parallels between the 
struggle of Palestinians and 
that of black Americans during the civil rights movement.
Since the winners were 
announced on Jan. 15, many 
members of the local and 
national Jewish community 
have protested the selection 
of what they claim is an ill-informed and hate-? lled essay 
as a winner of a contest designed to honor the memory 
of Martin Luther King Jr.
About two dozen people 
attended the forum, which 
was facilitated by Donner 
housefellow and coordinator 
of spirituality and meaningmaking programs Kenneth 
Lawson. Among the attendees 
were Carnegie Mellon students, several members of the 
Carnegie Mellon English department, and several members of the local community.
Before the forum began, 
facilitators stressed that the 
emphasis of the forum was 
on dialogue, not debate  
although little traditional debate actually occurred. Critics 
of the essay did not provide 
much evidence to back up 
their claims about its tone, 
nor were they of? cially encouraged to. 
Opponents of the essay 
argued that it was so ? lled 
with hatred against the Jewish people that Carnegie 
Mellon had a responsibility 
not to condone it by giving it 
an award. Eliana Weiner, a 
sophomore Bachelor of Humanities and Arts student in 
architecture and psychology 
and member of the Carnegie 
Mellon group Tartans for Israel, said that she went into 
the forum looking less to critique the essay, and more to 
? nd out why it was chosen as 
a winner.
I was more offended by 
the institutions choice of the 
essay  to elevate it  rather than the kids writing it, 
Weiner said.
According to English professor Yona Harvey, who has 
served on the selection committee in prior years, the essays are chosen as winners 
based on several factors.
Essentially, were looking 
for people who can tie their 
topic to the legacy of Dr. King. 
Craft has also been cited  
how well its actually written. 
I guess it can be subjective, 
just like any submission to 
a national journal, Harvey 
said.
The essay does have many 
supporters. Dr. Naftali Kaminski, an Israeli professor at the 
University of Pittsburgh, said 
that he believes Lieberfelds 
essay was, in many ways, true 
to Kings spirit. 
Kaminski pointed to Lieberfelds reference to Kings 
letter from Birmingham jail, 
and called the letter a guiding document for people who 
want to change reality.

Computing Services gave 
Carnegie Mellons webmail a 
new look over winter break. 
When students and faculty 
logged into their SquirrelMail 
accounts after the break, 
they saw a more modern 
layout and some changes in 
functionality.
Computing Services email 
team manager  Shlomo Balass 
said via email, Computing 
Services heard the feedback 
from the community that 
the existing webmail service 
was not meeting their needs, 
and frankly rather ugly, 
especially given how the state 
of webmail has changed over 
the past years.
After hearing this feedback, the email team for 
Computing Services started 
a project geared at updating 
the webmail site. According to 
Balass, the strongest aspect of 
the old webmail system was 
its custom theme selection. 
The team decided to focus on 
this part of the site.
We did some research 
and found a company that 
provided a number of modern themes at an affordable 
price, Balass said.
When students and faculty returned from break 
and opened up the webmail 
site, they were greeted by 
a brand new interface. I 
was surprised. I didnt know 
the changes were coming. I 
opened it up, and Oh! Thats 
a new look!  said Diane Turnshek, outreach coordinator 
for the physics department. 
However, students and faculty have noticed more than 
mere aesthetic changes to the 
site. 
One new function to Andrew Webmail is the autocomplete feature in the email 
address bar, which automatically detects who users are 
trying to email when they 
type in names or Andrew IDs.
Though faculty and students alike appreciate the 
changes, they have found a 
few ? aws.
There are clunky parts 
and things that are better, 
Turnshek said. 
She noted the auto-complete function in the address 
bar as one occasional source

Lecture Preview
Researchers at Carnegie 
Mellon, the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology, and 
the Georgia Institute of Technology found that Twitter users say only about a third of 
the tweets they receive are 
worth reading.
According to Twitters 
website, more than 200 million tweets are sent each day. 
However, most users get little 
feedback about the messages 
they send, except when their 
tweets are retweeted by their 
followers or when people opt 
to stop following them. 
If we understood what is 
worth reading and why, said 
Paul Andr, a postdoctoral 
fellow in the Human-Computer Interaction Institute 
and lead author of the study, 
in a university press release, 
we might design better tools 
for presenting and ? ltering 
content, as well as help people understand the expectations of other users.
Andr worked with his 
colleagues  Michael Bernstein and Kurt Luther, doctoral students at MIT and Georgia Tech, respectively  to 
create Who Gives a Tweet?: 
a website that collects readers evaluations of tweets. 
Those who have visited 
Andr and his teams website 
were promised feedback on 
their tweets if they agreed to 
anonymously rate tweets by 
the users they were already 
following. Over a period of 
19 days in late 2010 and early 
2011, 1,443 visitors to the site 
rated 43,738 tweets from the 
accounts of 21,014 Twitter 
users they followed. 
Overall, the readers liked 
just 36 percent of the tweets 
and disliked 25 percent, 
while another 39 percent 
elicited no strong opinion.
The researchers will present their work next Monday 
at the Association for Computing Machinerys Conference on Computer Supported 
Cooperative Work in Seattle.
Carnegie Mellons Center 
for the Arts in Society (CAS), 
a research center within the 
Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences and 
the College of Fine Arts, will 
host a panel of six members 
of local media outlets who 
will discuss how technology 
and social media are changing news.
The panel event is titled 
New Media/News Media: 
How New Media Is Changing 
The Aesthetics of News, and 
will be held Wednesday at 
4:30 p.m. in Steinberg Auditorium (Baker Hall A53). The 
event is free and open to the 
public.
Topics will include how 
the panelists roles have 
evolved due to technological innovations, what those 
changes mean for consumers, 
and what the future holds for 
the media industry.
The panelists scheduled 
are John Allison, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette opinion 
editor; Deanna Garcia, an 
Essential Pittsburgh Radio 
reporter; Maria Lupinacci, 
an award-winning blogger; 
Tony Norman, a Pittsburgh 
Post-Gazette columnist; Chris 
Potter, a Pittsburgh City Paper 
editor; and Martha Rial, a 
Pulitzer Prize-winning photographer at the Pittsburgh 
Post-Gazette.
The panel event is part of 
the recently launched CAS 
Media Initiative, which explores the role new media 
plays in social life, cultural 
politics, and political mobilizations. 
James Duesing, a professor of art, and Kathy Newman, an associate professor 
of English, are leading the 
initiative. The CAS initiative 
will also support three academic projects in addition to 
sponsoring events on media 
issues.

DISCUSSION, from A1
When you want to change 
reality, when you want to ? ght 
injustice, you use nonviolent 
resistance, but it doesnt mean 
that you turn the other cheek. 
It means that you stand, you 
speak truth to power, Kaminski said. And I actually think 
that Jesses essay was re? ective of the spirit of the letter 
from Birmingham.
Students who attended the 
forum generally had positive 
reactions to the event.
I think it was a very good 
idea to have this forum in this 
environment, because I think 
the discussion was necessary, 
Weiner said. And I think it 
was successful, but at the 
same time, I think it veered 
off from what they wanted a 
bit, in terms of not trying to 
attack the writer himself, and 
using the personal facts about 
him.
Some opponents of the essay criticized Lieberfeld himself, calling him disturbed, illinformed, or pathetic. 
I sort of cringed when 
people started to analyze Jesse, a little, Kaminski said. I 
dont know that its fair, when 
the person is not here.
I am happy I went to [the 
event], as it helped me to get 
a feel for the pulse of the community that I am part of, said 
Chloe Lynn Oxley, a junior 
double-majoring in decision 
science and professional writing, in an email. 
Oxley added that while she 
was glad the Carnegie Mellon 
community was able to have 
an open discussion, that was 
not enough on its own. 
Lets not stop at getting 
our viewpoints off our chests, 
but instead, lets consider 
working towards something 
greater than ourselves. Respect is crucial and time is of 
the essence, Oxley said.
Smith said that if members of the campus community have a problem with the 
way any aspect of the Martin 
Luther King Jr. Day festivities 
are run, there are opportunities for them to do something 
about it.
We start planning for 
MLK the day after MLK happens. If theres anyone in the 
room who wants to be involved in that process, to continue to create opportunities 
for these kinds of meaningful 
dialogues, or if you have ideas 
that youd like to see happen 
that day  its a day for everyone, Smith said. If you want 
to get involved in that process, 
and you have suggestions, I 
encourage you to email us, 
and well present those suggestions for next year.
Lieberfelds essay can be 
read online at the Pittsburgh 
Post-Gazettes website.

Paul S. Goodman, a professor of organizational psychology and theory at the Tepper 
School of Business, passed 
away at his home in Pittsburgh 
on Jan. 24 after suffering a 
stroke earlier in the month.
Goodman, who was 74 
when he passed away, joined 
the Carnegie Mellon faculty 
in 1972 and received the Richard M. Cyert Professorship for 
teaching excellence in 2000. 
His research focused on organizational linkages, new forms 
of groups, and knowledgesharing in international environments.
Goodmans expertise made 
an impact in areas other than 
academia. He was very interested in the international 
activities of Carnegie Mellon, 
said Mark S. Kamlet, provost 
and executive vice president 
at Carnegie Mellon. He was 
an advocate that Carnegie 
Mellon should try to do things 
internationally.... He started a 
number of important relationships for Carnegie Mellon.
Although Goodman played 
a vital role in programs 
from Mexico to Singapore, 
Kamlet put the most focus 
on a program in South Africa 
where Goodman helped the 
local government to train 
disadvantaged women to be 
software engineers. 
It was one of the ? rst 
programs of its type, Kamlet said. It educated a lot of 
young women in South Africa 
in technology, probably more 
so than any other program in 
South Africa.
Goodmans students said 
that he was dedicated to 
teaching and that he tried to 
offer them his best guidance. 
Sam Swift, a Ph.D. student in 
business, said, He cared a lot 
that when you did research, 
you didnt just rush from an 
idea to conclusions, and that 
at every step you thought carefully about what idea you were 
testing, what that meant, and 
how you were testing it. 
Nazli Turan, another Ph.D. 
student in business, also expressed her respect for Goodman. He made sure to remind 
us of larger questions, the motivation behind your research 
idea, to make sure that its impactful, to make sure its well 
thought out, Turan said. We 
expected tough questions, the 
deeper level questions from 
Paul every single time in the 
seminar.
Beyond academia, Goodman shared his insights and 
expertise with the public 
through ? lm. He made three 
documentaries and several 
short videos. 
According to Laurie R. 
Weingart, a professor of 
organizational behavior and 
theory, Goodmans ? lms 
often allowed his audience 
to see a wide range of living 
conditions, especially those 
of individuals who are often 
underrepresented.
An informal memorial service was held in the Ph.D. student lounge in the Posner Center by Goodmans colleagues 
and students last Monday.

of frustration. It auto-completes everything, including 
all the mistakes Ive made. So 
I have to ? gure out which are 
the incorrect ones Ive typed, 
she said.
Senior electrical and 
computer engineering major 
Ninar Nuemah also noticed 
that SquirrelMail no longer 
automatically ? lls out a list 
of email addresses, or a d-list, 
that had been typed out in the 
past. Nuemah said that this 
was a feature of SquirrelMail 
she heavily relied on, and that 
she now has to manually copy 
and paste lists of addresses.
First-year English major 
Cassie Geckle said that opening an email in SquirrelMail 
now causes readability problems. Whenever you open an 
email in SquirrelMail, it will 
change the formatting sometimes, or it will put in weird 
little things where there are 
supposed to be symbols instead of the actual symbols. 
You have to download a document to see the actual symbols. Why are we doing that? 
Geckle said.
For the most part, students and faculty agree that 
the changes made were much 
needed. John Oddo, assistant 
professor of rhetoric, said that 
when he arrived at Carnegie 
Mellon, he was surprised at 
the old email system, given 
the universitys reputation.
It reminded me of my 
very ? rst email account. I 
know that seems odd, but I remember when email was ? rst 
created, Oddo said. [SquirrelMail] was primitive-seeming. Now they made it more 
contemporary and gave it 
bells and whistles.
According to Geckle, a lot 
of her ? oormates stopped 
using SquirrelMail within a 
week of arriving and moved 
on to other email clients. 
I thought that there are 
better email clients out there. 
It wasnt very good at all,
Geckle said. Its not much 
better, its a little bit better. I 
think its easier to use now.
Turnshek even asked her 
fellow co-workers if they noticed the changes made to 
Carnegie Mellons webmail 
system. Not a lot of people 
use it, so either a) they didnt 
notice the changes or b) they 
didnt know it even changed, 
Turnshek said. They got frustrated with [the old email] 
and moved on. 
No one mentioned it to 
me. Technology sometimes 
becomes invisible unless it 
gives you issues, Oddo said. 
The visual experience you 
have colors your interpretation of technology. 
Balass said that Computing Services welcomes 
feedback from the community about what should be 
changed. Webmail services 
are never static, Balass said. 
As people become more savvy and as email needs change, 
the webmail application has 
to evolve to meet the communitys needs.

Pedro Moreno, a research 
scientist at Google and a 
Carnegie Mellon alumnus, 
spoke in the Giant Eagle Auditorium last Friday about 
Googles current efforts in 
building speech recognition 
systems for the top 300 languages on the planet. The 
project, called The Speech 
Internationalization Project, 
allows users to give verbal requests to their phones in any 
language. The textual transcription of the spoken words 
is used to ful? ll the request. 
Moreno obtained his Ph.D. 
from Carnegie Mellon in 1996. 
His thesis, titled Speech 
Recognition in Noisy Environments, proved to be only the 
? rst step in his career. After 
working as a research scientist at HP Labs, Moreno joined 
Google seven years ago. He 
currently leads the global 
speech engineering group 
in Googles Android division 
in New York. His team is in 
charge of creating speech recognition services in as many 
languages as possible. 
The development of this 
speech recognition technology, Moreno explained, has 
three phases. The ? rst phase 
involves collecting spoken 
words for a particular language. To do this, Google 
employees collect thousands 
of queries that people type 
into Googles search engine 
and record them being read 
aloud. These pieces of audio 
are paired with the textual 
transcriptions and placed in 
the Google servers. These 
audio and text queries represent the training data that 
the speech recognition technology will use to improve its 
performance. In the last two 
years, Google has been able 
to create training data for as 
many as 50 languages. 
The next phase is producing acoustic models  mapping each phoneme to how 
the audio sounds  and producing language models that 
review the text and create a 
mechanism that predicts how 
likely it is that a certain word 
will appear after a particular 
sequence of words. Spoken 
language gradually changes 
over time, and in order to account for this, the acoustic 
and language models have 
to be updated regularly with 
new spoken queries representing new training data.
The ? nal stage is the formation of the lexicons  how 
each word in a language is 
expressed as a sequence of 
phonemes.
One of the valuable lessons that Moreno learned 
in the development of the 
project was that, when faced 
with a problem in a speci? c 
language, the solution should 
be as general and holistic as 
possible, so it can be applied 
to the speech recognition of 
other languages. 
Presently, users of the system collectively speak about 
55,000 hours worth of queries each day, and 40 percent 
of those users are outside of 
the U.S., showing that The 
Speech Internationalization 
Project is becoming popular 
around the world. 
Thirty-? ve languages and 
dialects have been launched 
(including Latin and Pig-Latin), and 10 more languages 
are in pre-production.
The speech team at Google 
is also trying to work out issues in dealing with multilinguality in countries. When 
there are many different languages used within a single 
country, issues arise with how 
to create new recognition systems for similar languages. 
Capturing the lexicons of 
those languages becomes 
dif? cult.
Despite the challenges of 
the project, it has continued 
to advance. As Moreno put it, 
why create speech recognizers for three languages when 
you can do that for 300 with 
the same effort?

Materials science and engineering assistant professor 
Chris Bettingers innovative 
approaches in designing materials for implanted medical 
devices have recently been 
recognized by the National 
Academy of Sciences (NAS)  
with an award for Initiatives 
in Research. Supported by 
Alcatel-Lucent Bell Labs, the 
award recognizes innovative 
young scientists and encourages research likely to lead 
toward new capabilities for 
human bene? t, according to 
its website.
In addition to performing original research on biodegradable polymers for his 
Ph.D. at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), 
Bettinger was also co-inventor 
on a number of patents during 
his time as a graduate student.
Bettinger arrived at Carnegie Mellon in August 2010 to 
start his own research group, 
and has since been developing 
biomedical materials whose 
physical properties can be 
altered based on exposure to 
stimuli such as temperature 
and electric ? elds.
Bettinger admitted serendipity as a contributing factor to the inspiration behind 
his work, but recognized that 
new ideas often come from 
making connections among 
different ? elds. He noted that 
it is very easy to get drawn 
into the speci? cs of a single 
problem, especially during 
undergraduate and graduate 
studies, and found that there 
is value to stepping back every once in a while and seeing things from a different 
perspective.
Whether it is something 
as simple as reading a new 
book or attending a seminar 
in another department, Bettinger believes that the whole 
process of learning something 
new is vital to innovation. 
What happens at the very 
least is you draw parallels, he 
said. The scienti? c process is 
pretty symmetric across different disciplines  theyre 
different cultures, of course 
 but the whole process is the 
same, and you can use that to 
draw connections to other 
things.
Bettinger pointed to his 
own academic path as an 
example for making interdisciplinary connections. 
All three of his degrees from 
MIT are in different areas, 
spanning from chemical to 
biomedical engineering to 
materials science. The jumps 
across many disciplines was 
a result of his broad range of 
interests. I ? nd that the interesting things are at the intersection [of ? elds], Bettinger 
said.
Despite working across 
different departments, the 
common thread throughout 
Bettingers studies has been 
polymers. He described his 
interest in polymeric materials by drawing an analogy to 
molecular building blocks. 
With polymer chemistry, he 
explained, the real potential 
is in the ability to synthesize 
materials from the ground up 
based on a material property 
that were looking for. 
Bettinger takes a very speci? c approach when designing polymers in his lab; one of 
his research focuses is to tailor materials for endovascular 
devices.
For example, one of his 
current projects is directed 
toward designing a polymer 
that can help treat aneurysms. 
People with aneurysms have a 
weakened area in a blood vessel which, if left untreated, 
could fatally rupture. Current 
treatment methods involve 
injecting embolic agents that 
? ll an aneurysm to prevent 
it from growing larger. However, some aneurysms cant 
be treated that way due to 
their shape; if the opening is 
too wide, embolic agents will 
? ow out of the aneurysm as 
soon as theyre injected into 
it. One way to circumvent 
this problem is to use a device 
that will narrow the opening, 
thereby allowing the embolic 
agents enough time to ? ll the 
aneurysm.
Bettinger believes that 
a biodegradable polymer 
would be suitable for such a 
device, and is currently designing a material that would 
be ? exible enough for this 
purpose.
In addition to addressing clinical problems with 
specially designed polymers, 
Bettingers research group 
also designs materials for answering some fundamental 
questions about biology, such 
as how the human body recognizes implanted devices or 
how cells detect and respond 
to surface structures.
One polymer currently 
under design has the ability 
to alter its texture based on 
exposure to light, and will be 
used to discover how cells respond to changes in surface 
topography. By knowing how 
cells interface with materials, 
it becomes possible to design 
materials for applications 
such as therapeutic cellular 
stimulation.
Whether fundamental or 
applied, Bettingers research 
seeks to overcome problems 
with existing materials and 
make advances in implantable medical devices.

Planet or no planet? That is the question
Fomalhaut b, one of the 
? rst planets outside the solar system to be discovered 
through direct imaging, is under debate; scientists are beginning to question whether 
or not it is actually a planet. 
The so-called planet does 
not exhibit light in the infrared 
range, even though a planet 
visible through a telescope 
should be hot enough to emit 
infrared light. Second, Fomalhaut bs brightness decreased 
by half within two years, interpreted as having lost half of its 
mass. 
Paul Kalas, the planets 
discoverer, argued that it 
may have a large dust ring in 
orbit that re? ects light while 
still having a mass too low to 
emit enough detectable infrared light. Markus Janson, 
who conducted the follow-up 
experiments, argued that the 
detected object may be the result of asteroid collisions producing an expanding cloud of 
light-re? ecting dust instead of 
condensing into a planet.

Cheaper catalyst developed for cheaper goods
Researchers at Princeton 
University developed an ironbased catalyst for the silylation 
of organic compounds. Silylation is a widely used procedure for the production of 
complex compounds, such as 
adhesives and pharmaceuticals. Industrial catalysts in 
past decades have been restricted to high-cost precious 
metals like platinum instead 
of cheap metals like iron. 
While catalysts are not destroyed during chemical reactions, they can still be lost in 
chemical production on industrial scales. For example, an 
estimated 5.6 metric tons of 
platinum was used by the silicone industry and could not 
be recovered for future use. 
In addition to its low cost, the 
new iron catalyst may also increase the purity of products.

Genetic damage in chemotherapy patients children
It is not uncommon for 
cancer survivors to have children, especially with ongoing 
improvements in chemotherapy. However, cancer patients 
medications may lead to damaged DNA and increased rates 
of cancer in their children. 
Researchers at the University of Leicester in England 
measured the mutation rates 
of mice exposed to common 
chemotherapy agents at an 
equivalent dosage used for human therapy. They measured 
for mutations in the sperm of 
males who were treated and 
untreated with chemotherapy, 
as well as in their offspring. 
Extensive genome-wide damage was found and, for one 
drug, as many as three times 
the normal number of mutations were found in the offspring.

Female leadership impacts gender gap and womens roles
The Indian government set 
aside leadership positions for 
women in a number of rural 
villages in 1993. Collaborating 
researchers in several top universities have found that these 
leadership positions have had 
tremendous impacts on the 
gender gap and the roles of 
women in these societies. 
Aspirations were measured 
with questions pertaining to 
desire for early marriage, future education, and high-skill 
jobs. Parents aspirations increased 20 percent and children of both genders had a 
32 percent increase in aspirations. These changes occurred 
in addition to an increase in 
favorability of female leaders. 
Since increases in favorability 
occurred alongside the increases in aspirations, researchers suggest that the increase in aspirations re? ects 
the power of role models in 
society.

Facebook to sell stock publicly, $10 billion expected
Last Wednesday, Facebook 
? led for an IPO that would 
allow the company to sell 
stock publicly. The company 
is expected to face a ? ood of 
prospective buyers and raise 
almost $10 billion. The announcement was followed by 
expectations that Facebook 
users will also bene? t in some 
way from the company going 
public. 
Many expect Mark Zuckerberg, Facebooks CEO and 
co-founder, to uphold honorable business practices while 
engaging with Wall Street. 
Facebook makes its revenue 
in part from the advertisement opportunities it offers 
businesses, but it also makes 
more by developing new technologies. The company spent 
$388 million last year in research and development, and 
will likely continue to devote 
itself to new technologies in 
the future.

Texas town must have water delivered
The ongoing Texas drought 
has forced the central Texas 
community of Spicewood 
Beach to have its drinking water delivered from out of town. 
Since last Monday, the water 
has been delivered several 
times a day by a 4,000-galloncapacity truck. 
State climatologist John 
Nielsen-Gammon explained 
that the drought started over 
one year ago, and the state 
received just 15 inches of rain 
last year, far below the average of 28 inches. The Spicewood Beach community water 
well is just one of 13 public 
water systems in the state that 
are expected to completely 
run out of water in the next six 
months.

EOC returns Wednesday; networking event debuts next week
ALLISON COSBY
Pillbox Editor
Employers and students 
seeking full-time jobs or internship opportunities will 
take over the University Center this week for the annual 
Employment Opportunities 
Conference (EOC). A new 
networking event focusing on 
startup companies will also be 
held in the University Center 
next week.
This years EOC, which will 
run from noon to 6 p.m. on 
Wednesday, will include 190 
companies with booths set 
up in Wiegand Gymnasium, 
Rangos Hall, and the McKenna/Peter/Wright rooms. The 
event is limited to Carnegie 
Mellon students and alumni of 
all majors.
Name tags are required 
for admittance. Students who 
register in advance on TartanTrak will have pre-printed tags 
ready for them at the door.
Expansion into McKenna/
Peter/Wright makes the 2012 
EOC noticeably larger than 
last years, which drew over 
150 employers to campus. 
In a campuswide email last 
Tuesday, the Career and Professional Development Center  (CPDC) said that reduced 
booth fees for small businesses 
had contributed to the fairs 
size and diversity.
Signi? cant discounts have 
been offered to organizations 
with 100 employees or less, 
the email stated. This has 
attracted an unprecedented 
number of startups and midsized organizations from various sectors, including government and nonpro? t.
In addition to this years 
EOC, the CPDC will be hosting 
a new event called TechSpark, 
an initiative to create recruiting opportunities for small 
startup companies. TechSpark 
will take place next Monday 
from 6 to 9 p.m. in Rangos 
Hall. Students must register 
on TartanTrak by Sunday in 
order to participate.
TechSpark is an interactive 
event that will include three 
main portions: a keynote address from Carnegie Mellon 
alumnus and entrepreneur 
Tony Berkman, presentations 
from select companies, and a 
general reception for networking purposes.
Unlike the EOC, there will 
be no booths for companies at 
the reception. Each company 
will instead have a small table, 
and students and alumni will 
be encouraged to mingle with 
the employers in attendance.
Were hoping that students wont queue up in front 
of a table, but that there will 
be conversations amongst students, employers, and alumni, said Wahab Owolabi, assistant director for employer 
development for the CPDC.
As of Saturday, 23 companies were registered to participate in TechSpark, including 
software development, web 
development, social media, 
and other entrepreneurshipfocused companies.
Owolabi said that the companies coming in are de? nitely well aware that students 
attending TechSpark will not 
be only computer science or 
electrical and computer engineering majors. Its students 
who are interested in entrepreneurship, innovation, and 
working for a startup or an 
emerging company, he said.
The new event was created 
largely in reaction to requests 
from such smaller companies, 
which cant compete with larger companies at events like the 
EOC and the Technical Opportunities Conference, as well as 
requests from students. Its 
an interesting dynamic because weve heard from these 
types of companies that this 
was something that was needed, and weve heard from students that this was needed, 
Owolabi said.
A rsum book will be 
handed out to the employers 
in attendance. Rsums of students who register on TartanTrak in advance will be included in the book, so students will 
not have to bring copies to the 
event.
Owolabi thinks the setup 
will allow for more relaxed 
and meaningful discussions 
between students, alumni, and 
employers. Youre not going 
to be in the event like, Heres 
my rsum; what do you 
think? And I think thats going to encourage some deeper 
conversations, he said.
Noting that TechSpark was 
organized pretty quickly, 
Owolabi said that one focus of 
his of? ce has been publicizing 
the event. TechSparks date 
was included as a line item 
in a CPDC email last December, with further details announced in two more emails 
last week. Were doing a big 
push in terms of letting students know whats happening 
and whos going to be here, 
and what kind of opportunity 
this is, Owolabi said.
Despite the CPDCs efforts, 
many students remain unaware of the event or, if they 
have heard of it, are unsure 
whether it will be useful. Ive 
heard of it and Im going ... but 
I dont think a lot of students 
are interested in working for 
startups, said Siddhant Sethi, 
a ? rst-year electrical and computer engineering major.
I dont know anything 
about [TechSpark], but Ive 
heard of it, sophomore electrical and computer engineering major Matthew Baron 
said. After hearing a description of the event, Baron questioned its usefulness: I think 
it serves a certain purpose for 
certain students; however, I 
think a lot of CMU students 
are motivated enough to start 
their own startups, so why 
would they want to work for 
other peoples startups?
Owolabi feels that students 
are interested in this type of 
event. He said, You have the 
opportunity for companies to 
come in here and talk to you 
in a very meaningful and engaging way about what theyre 
doing, what theyre trying to 
accomplish, and how you can 
be a part of that  I think students are interested in that.
Around 60 students were 
registered for TechSpark as of 
early last week, but Owolabi 
had high hopes for the event: 
From start to ? nish, I would 
imagine anywhere between 
300 to 400 students will come 
in and out of Rangos.

North Shore Connector should not be transit priority
Josh Smith/Forum Editor
The North Shore Connector, a 
1.2-mile-long light rail tunnel under 
the Allegheny River that connects 
Downtown and the North Shore, is 
set to open by the end of March. The 
$523 million project doesnt address 
the pressing needs of Pittsburgh; due 
to the construction of the connector, 
the citys prevalent issues with public 
transportation are being overlooked.
That is not to say that the North 
Shore Connector isnt bene? cial to 
the city. Pittsburgh is spending relatively little for the expensive project. 
The connectors primary funding 
is a federal grant program, with an 
additional $62 million coming from 
federal stimulus. The Allegheny 
County Port Authority also stated 
the that project supported 4,000 local jobs, according to a report on 
pittsburghlive.com.
While the economic advantages 
of the North Shore Connector are 
substantial, they are temporary, and 
the project seems to be a mis? re. 
Besides the maintenance and repair 
that many roads, highways, and 
bridges in the region need, areas like 
Downtown and the Squirrel Hill Tunnel constantly deal with traf? c congestion issues that are more pressing 
than the connector.
The Port Authority deals with a 
signi? cant lack of funding annually 
and often threatens to cut bus routes 
important to the city. Numerous 
communities already have insuf? -
cient public transportation support. 
Important areas in and around Pittsburgh such as Oakland, the airport, 
and Downtown could be better connected. The funds used for the North 
Shore Connector could have been 
used to address, if not solve, these 
more pressing issues. Expanding a 
light rail system between Downtown 
and Oakland would greatly serve 
the needs of the large population 
of college students in Oakland who 
depend on public transportation. 
The expenditures of college students 
help support the local economy, and 
student spending largely depends 
on how students get around. If Pittsburgh were to improve transit to and 
from Oakland, it would be bene? cial 
to the citys economy.
Efforts like the North Shore Connector lack the necessary scope to 
improve public transportation in the 
Pittsburgh area. Instead, measures 
should be taken to improve transit 
among hubs such as Oakland, Downtown, the Waterfront, and the Pittsburgh International Airport.
State resolution disobeys spirit of First Amendment
Recent bill undermines public school authority
DANIEL COHANPOUR
Junior Staffwriter
Public schools in the U.S. are 
offering an increasing amount of 
parental exemptions for certain 
coursework. Usually these exemptions are used for sexual education and health issues, but parental 
objections in the classroom have 
recently been taken to a new level. 
Last month, the Republican-dominated New Hampshire legislature 
passed House Bill 542, which allows 
parents to issue an exception to 
speci? c course material based on ... 
[their] determination that the material is objectionable.
New Hampshire parents now 
possess complete control to object 
to any program or assignment that 
arises. 
The bill indicates that school districts can no longer mandate a parent to send his or her child to any 
school program to which they are 
conscientiously opposed. 
In addition, the law does not require parents to give an explanation 
for the speci? c curriculum alteration. In essence, parents can now 
reject course material on a whim, as 
long as the student graduates with 
state graduation requirements.
The New Hampshire legislation 
was a clear attempt by the Republican legislature to continue undermining the public school system. 
As Supreme Court Justice Robert 
H. Jackson highlighted in the case 
McCollum v. Board of Education, If 
we are to eliminate everything that 
is objectionable to any [person] 
or is inconsistent with any of their 
doctrines, we will leave the public 
schools in shreds.
Robert Kunzman, education 
professor at Indiana University in 
Bloomington, expressed the overarching question of balancing parental discretion and public school freedom. Earlier this year, in a report on 
abcnews.go.com, he posed the question, How wide can we make the 
circle in our public schools in terms 
of helping families to feel welcomed 
and feel their beliefs and perspectives are accommodated? Although 
parental discretion in common offensive cases is understandable, 
this new law funnels an excessive 
amount of power to the parents and 
tilts the balance almost to the point 
of educational obsolescence.
The law transforms public school 
education from a public good into a 
private (family-owned) mechanism. 
It is bound to lead to disagreements 
between parents and administrators 
on suitable lesson alternatives, and 
as a result, with every alternative 
plan, curricula will become increasingly con? icting. It is bene? cial for a 
school to offer accommodations for 
students, but there need to be clear 
limits.
The New Hampshire law, biases 
and all, is beginning a trend of parental domination within the realm 
of education. Arizona and Georgia 
state legislatures are proposing similar legislation. 
Although some district agreements should be made, the bill completely rejects the district-parent negotiation process and allows parents 
to object to school instruction in an 
ongoing state-wide culture war. The 
law is demeaning, disrespectful, 
and dangerous to the future of New 
Hampshire students, and to students 
across the nation.
Twitter policy promotes transparent censorship
BRADEN KELNER
Junior Staffwriter
Since Twitters creation in 2006, 
the website has been a hub of unrestricted news. Now, six years later, 
Twitter has announced a new censorship policy that could once again 
change freedom of expression on 
the web.
Simply put, Twitters new censorship policy will allow the removal 
of tweets on a country-by-country 
basis. 
When a government orders that 
a post be taken down, the post will 
be replaced by a statement saying,  
This tweet from @username has 
been withheld in: Country. However, the post will remain visible to 
users in all other countries where no 
such order was issued.
Twitter is also partnering with 
the website chillingeffects.org to 
announce when a post has been censored. The openness regarding censored material is crucial to positively 
shaping censorship on the internet.
With the introduction of the new 
policy, Twitter has indirectly urged 
other websites to follow suit with 
transparent censorship policies. 
Transparent censorship, in terms of 
Twitters policy, means the company 
in question promises to be honest 
about removing posts while ensuring minimal censorship. Secretive 
censorship will occur rarely, if at 
all, on Twitter due to the openness 
of censored posts. Additionally, the 
fact that posts will not be taken 
down universally will allow a maximal number of users to see a post. 
Hopefully other web services like 
Twitter will alter their censorship 
policies to create an environment of 
free speech.
Many critics claim this new policy will entail heavy monitoring of 
tweets; however, the company will 
only review content if there are requests to take it down. 
The lack of monitoring, in addition to censorship noti? cations, will 
increase information availability on 
the web.
Twitter will adjust its censorship 
policy to accommodate strict laws 
and, in doing so, revolutionize censorship. 
Both users and governments are 
accommodated in regards to the 
removal of posts through this transparent policy. 
Twitter is once again pioneering a new trend of unrestricted free 
speech across the globe with the introduction of its transparent censorship policy.
Its often said that Democrats 
and Republicans cant agree on anything, that their intense hatred for 
one another makes passing even 
the most trivial legislation an uphill 
battle. However, on Jan. 23, both the 
Democratic and Republican members of the Pennsylvania House of 
Representatives managed to unanimously agree on something. Surely 
this agreement was a sign that our 
state leaders were coming together 
for something important  funding 
public transit, for instance.
Unfortunately, this faith was misplaced. In its 1930 vote, the House 
passed Resolution 535, declaring 
that 2012 shall be known as the 
Year of the Bible in Pennsylvania. 
This legislation blatantly disregards 
the spirit of the First Amendment.
The House laid out its rationale 
in the resolution. Much of this reasoning is dedicated to explaining the 
historical importance of the Bible 
in the development of the United 
States. While its impossible to disregard the impact that Christianity has 
in American history, it does not explain why 2012 should be any more 
the Year of the Bible than 1912, or 
1860, or 1776, or any year since the 
Christian Biblical canon was ? nalized around 400 C.E.
The history is not, of course, the 
real reason the House passed its 
resolution. 
The text declares that the Bible is 
the word of God, that renewing 
our knowledge of and faith in God 
through holy scripture will restore 
Americas strength, and ? nally that 
there is a national need to study 
and apply the teachings of the holy 
scriptures.
The House doesnt say which version of the Bible Americans should 
be studying or which holy scriptures 
they should be applying. However, 
we suspect that the vote would not 
have been unanimous had a representative suggested that Americans 
read and apply the teachings of the 
Quran  many of which coincide 
with teachings in the Christian Bible 
and the lessons of every other major 
religion for the last few thousand 
years.
 We doubt the House would even 
pass a resolution in support of one of 
the principal tenets of these religions 
by declaring 2012 to be a Year of 
Peace.
The Pennsylvania House opposed 
the spirit of the First Amendment by 
passing this bill. Instead of declaring that all Americans need to study 
the Bible and renew their faith in a 
speci? c God, Pennsylvanias legislators might want to consider studying 
their oaths of of? ce and applying the 
Constitution of the United States. 
Consumers should be more aware of product origins
This week, Apple was criticized 
for the poor working conditions in 
the Chinese factories that manufacture its products. 
Charles Duhigg and David Barboza of The New York Times reported 
that employees at Apples manufacturing partner, Foxconn, undergo 
12-hour shifts in horrible conditions. 
An aluminum dust buildup resulted 
in an explosion in an iPad production facility in May 2011. This in turn 
resulted in two immediate deaths 
and dozens of injuries. After threats 
of mass suicides due to working conditions, nets were installed to catch 
employees attempting to jump to 
their deaths.
News of such conditions shouldnt 
have come as much of a surprise, 
given that this isnt the ? rst time 
Foxconn has been investigated on 
charges of abuse. 
Although Apple CEO Tim Cook 
recently delivered an internal statement to Apples employees stating 
that the company will not... stand 
still or turn a blind eye to problems 
in our supply chain, the problems 
are more widespread than one company can ? x.
Foxconn and similar companies 
support hundreds of American corporations every day, such as Apple, 
Microsoft, and Hewlett-Packard. 
We should take monetary power 
in our hands as consumers and investors and pull support from companies that enable this kind of abuse. At 
a time when Americans have stepped 
up to the plate against Stop Online 
Piracy Act, pulling ? nancial support 
from companies that favored the bill, 
we consumers should learn that we 
are not powerless to instigate change 
with our wallets. 
Suggesting we all stop buying Apple products is unrealistic. But what 
if we could learn to value things differently instead? 
If the real worth of an item were 
not just a sleek design and a fast 
processor, but also an ethical manufacturing process, if we made it fashionable to be mindful of a products 
origins, then we could see a real difference.
Hopefully other 
web services like 
Twitter will alter 
their censorship 
policies to create 
an environment of 
free speech.

Harms of hookah smoking go unacknowledged
CONNIE CHAN
Junior Staffwriter
America began integrating hookah into its social scene in the early 
2000s. Approximately 200 to 300 
hookah bars opened for business in 
the U.S. from 2000 to 2004, according to the Smokeshop journal. Unlike 
cigarettes, hookah has a relatively 
positive reputation, which caused its 
popularity to skyrocket among young 
adults.
I have many friends who proclaim 
their disgust for cigarettes, yet these 
same friends do not hesitate to blow 
some smoke rings from a hookah. 
Investigations have shown the consequences of hookah may not stray 
far from those of its more notorious 
counterpart. 
Studies by the World Health Organization show that smoking hookah 
can be worse for your health than 
cigarettes  a hard fact to swallow 
for those deceived by the fun and 
laid-back atmosphere associated 
with hookah.
Upon questioning a few of my 
friends about their reasons for smoking hookah, I found out that many 
believed smoking hookah was safer 
than smoking cigarettes. First of all, 
this is not a reason  this is a comparison. I dont justify my giving 
blood on the basis that it hurts less 
than giving bone marrow. 
Secondly, this far too common 
comparison is a false one. According 
to a study by the World Health Organization, a person can inhale 100 
times more smoke from an hour-long 
hookah session than from a single 
cigarette.Though hookah smoke may 
feel smoother than cigarette smoke, 
it is just as harsh on the lungs. Kimber Richter, associate professor of 
preventive medicine at the University of Kansas, said in an article on 
kansan.com that the water doesnt 
? lter out chemicals and heavy metals: It only cools the smoke.
Ill admit that the smell of a hookah session can be quite calming and 
aromatic  I have smelled quality 
brands of shisha tobacco that give 
air fresheners a run for their money. 
However, this pleasant aroma masks 
the imminent danger of second-hand 
hookah smoke. Since the odor still 
contains tobacco smoke, it exposes 
people to the same harmful chemicals found in cigarette smoke, such 
as hydrogen cyanide, nicotine, and 
ammonia.
In fact, hookah smoke can be even 
worse than cigarette smoke. The 
burning of charcoal used to produce 
the smoke adds 143 grams of carbon 
monoxide per gram of shisha  11 
times the amount found in one cigarette  according to a study by the 
Tobacco-Related Disease Research 
Program. 
Keep in mind that an hour-long 
session requires about 15 grams of 
shisha. The same study reported that 
hookah smoke also contains higher 
levels of lead, nickel, and arsenic 
than cigarettes, as well as 36 times 
more tar. It shouldnt come as a surprise that hookah smoking can lead 
to heart disease, respiratory disease, 
and oral cancers. The harms of hookah have remained under the radar 
for far too long.
Dont get me wrong  I couldnt 
care less about what people choose 
to smoke, drink, eat, wear, or watch. 
What bothers me are faulty reasoning and beliefs behind a persons actions. If people are well aware of the 
actual effects of their smoking, then 
I will respect their educated decision. But it is disheartening when 
someone smokes hookah with a false 
understanding of its consequences. 
This smoker is either a victim of societys ignorance or in denial. In either situation, the truth needs to be 
acknowledged.
The best thing I can hope my cigarette-hating, shisha-smoking friends 
receive is enlightenment. Perhaps 
it was the onset of research that led 
policymakers to implement hookah 
bans throughout the U.S.
All of my friends owe it to themselves  and their bodies  to know 
the myths and facts of smoking hookah. If they choose to continue smoking, I can only hope they will bask 
in the fruity fragrance and relaxing 
effects of hookah without the air of 
ignorance.

High school junior embodies legacy of justice
SUJAYA BALACHANDRAN
Jesse Lieberfeld, a junior at Winchester Thurston School, wrote an 
essay titled Fighting a Forbidden 
Battle: How I Stopped Covering up 
for a Hidden Wrong. The essay tied 
for ? rst place in the prose category 
of Carnegie Mellons Martin Luther 
King Jr. Day Writing Awards. In the 
essay, Lieberfeld describes how he 
grappled with his support of Israel 
as he watched its treatment of Palestinians grow increasingly brutal and 
inhumane.
The controversial essay provoked 
backlash from students at Carnegie 
Mellon and members of local proIsrael and Zionist organizations. 
However, by illuminating many unfortunate truths about the lives of 
Palestinians in Israel and occupied 
territories, Lieberfeld demonstrated 
a commitment to human and civil 
rights as King had.
Lieberfelds critics are either unaware of or do not understand the 
discrimination against the Palestinian minority in Israel, who make up 
about 20 percent of the Israeli population. While Palestinian citizens 
in Israel have full voting rights and 
serve in the Knesset, the Israeli parliament, there are still inequities in 
areas of employment, education, and 
health care.
A study by Adalah, the legal center for Arab minority rights in Israel, 
stated that more than 30 main laws 
discriminate, directly or indirectly, 
against Palestinian citizens of Israel, 
and the current government coalition has proposed a ?ood of new 
racist and discriminatory bills which 
are at various stages in the legislative process. In his essay, Lieberfeld 
rightly compares the treatment of 
African-Americans in the U.S. to the 
current treatment of Palestinians.
Palestinians in the West Bank and 
the Gaza Strip are also subjected to 
segregation and human rights violations. Their freedom of movement is 
severely restricted because they are 
forbidden to travel on certain roads 
that are exclusively reserved for Israeli citizens.
A 2011 report from the United Nations Of? ce for the Coordination of 
Humanitarian Affairs detailed how 
this extensive system of roadblocks 
and checkpoints continues the system of constrained movement. Israeli 
human rights organization BTselem 
likened road segregation to the  
Apartheid in South Africa. Lieberfeld 
rightly condemned this discrimination, echoing Kings moral outrage 
expressed in Letter from Birmingham Jail.
Home demolitions and land expropriation occur regularly in the 
West Bank, leaving some Palestinians 
homeless and forcibly displaced. The 
separation barrier surrounding the 
West Bank, constructed in 2004 and 
declared illegal by the International 
Court of Justice, uproots farmland 
essential to the livelihoods of Palestinians and separates members of 
Palestinian families.
As a result, Palestinians in East 
Jerusalem and the West Bank have 
practiced nonviolent resistance and 
civil disobedience, holding weekly 
demonstrations to protest these conditions. Thus, Lieberfeld is justi? ed 
in drawing historical parallels with 
civil rights activists in the 1950s who 
implemented similar methods.
While the Israeli government argues that checkpoints, roadblocks, 
home demolitions, and other policies have been instituted for security 
reasons, Israels behavior toward Palestinians has grown increasingly discriminatory. 
Lieberfelds analysis of the con? ict 
is anchored in international law and 
universal principles of human rights. 
By bravely speaking out against the 
oppression of Palestinians, Lieberfeld embodies a legacy of social justice bequeathed by King.

LEADERSHIP PERSPECTIVESGSA takes measures to improve student life
JASON IMBROGNO
The Graduate Student Assembly (GSA) continues to serve the 
entire school community every 
day. Our department representatives and Executive Committee are 
some of the best and brightest students on this campus.
GSA members are proud of 
the fact that we are both the most 
visible and most vibrant piece of 
student government at Carnegie 
Mellon. Our school year began 
with an extensive involvement in 
Orientation. Every incoming graduate student had the opportunity 
to meet our executive members 
personally. GSA visited almost 
every department during Orientation in an effort to engage our 
new student population at the ? rst 
opportunity. Orientation included 
Ice Cream Day, a great new initiative from our Social Committee, 
and a barbecue that had nearly 
2,000 attendees.
We have spent a signi? cant 
chunk of our capital reserve over 
the past two years on campus 
maps, new weights at Skibo, and 
a forthcoming sound system in 
the ? tness room of the University 
Center. We recently extended the 
opportunity to offer suggestions 
for further uses of the funds to the 
entire grad student community. 
New (possibly covered) bike racks 
will be a reality on this campus in 
the near future. GSA pulled off 
another tremendously successful 
Beer Tasting event in December at 
Phipps Conservatory, and we are 
looking forward to our renowned 
Wine Tasting at the Aquarium in 
May. In the meantime, we will pull 
off events both large and small: ice 
skating is coming up on Feb. 17, 
the GSA-sponsored ski trip is on 
Feb. 26, and tickets to Carnegie 
Mellons own production of Sweeney Todd will be made available 
soon after skiing.
Finally, GSA has maintained 
an active role in campus affairs 
that cover both graduate and undergraduate issues. We worked 
closely with Computing Services 
to improve the wireless internet on 
campus after gathering information on dead zones from our student body. And club sports teams 
will begin to receive money to pay 
for coaches out of the Athletics Department budget instead of JFC, 
freeing up $60,000 for other student organizations.

SPORTS COMMENTARYMagic sinking because of Howard
CARL GLAZER
Junior Staffwriter
The Orlando Magic is the 
NBAs biggest loser. The team 
has quit, plain and simple. 
Not only have they lost six 
of their past nine games, but 
they also have problems that 
go deeper than their record. 
They have no explanation for 
putting up only 56 points in 
one game, and then blowing 
a 27-point lead ? ve days later. 
While Magic coach Stan Van 
Gundy has publicly taken the 
blame, it doesnt take much to 
see that team leader Dwight 
Howard is at fault. 
Howard has destroyed 
this team with his sel? shness 
and demands. By requiring a 
trade at the beginning of the 
season, he has told his teammates that he wants nothing 
to do with them. Over the past 
few weeks, Howard has publicly lashed out at his teammates for their lack of effort, 
but all it would take is one 
glance in the mirror to show 
him the root of the problem. 
Howard is trying to lead this 
team with one foot on the 
court and the other out the 
door, and is achieving unsurprising results. 
The time has come for the 
Magics front of? ce to put an 
end to this situation. The NBA 
has seen several high-pro? le 
stars holding their teams hostage with dif? cult demands. 
The last thing Orlando wants 
is for this situation to turn into 
one like LeBron James caused 
for the Cleveland Cavaliers 
two years ago. The Cavaliers 
front of? ce was faced with 
the choice of accepting the 
inevitable by trading James 
to maximize their return, or 
holding onto their star in vain 
hopes that he would suddenly 
change his mind at the end of 
the season. 
While the choice seems obvious, teams are very hesitant 
to trade their stars for fear of 
fans backlash. Owners know 
that, without their star, fan 
attendance and pro? ts would 
plummet. Teams hesitate to 
use the term rebuilding 
because it sounds like a surrender; it is an admission of 
mediocrity. But trading an allstar isnt always the same as 
waving the white ? ag. Sometimes its the best way to turn 
a losing team into a winning 
one. 
Look at the Denver Nuggets, who dealt with a similar 
situation with their star Carmelo Anthony. He demanded 
to be traded to the New York 
Knicks, eliminating all leverage for the Nuggets, but the 
team still managed to get several good players. Now, one 
season later, the Nuggets are 
excelling with the second-best 
record in their conference.
The Orlando Magics performance over the past few 
weeks has done nothing to 
show that this team, with 
its current group of players, 
wants to win. The Eastern 
Conference is weak, and the 
team has just as good of a 
shot as any to make it to the 
playoffs. But, before they 
even think about playing in 
the postseason, their roster 
needs to change. Howard was 
once the heart and soul of this 
team, but now he is the cancer 
causing its decay. 
Several trade possibilities 
have been rumored involving the New Jersey Nets, Los 
Angeles Lakers, and Dallas 
Mavericks  the three teams 
Howard said he would sign a 
long-term deal with. Any deal 
with the Nets would center 
around Brook Lopez, their 
young star center. Trades with 
the Mavericks and Lakers 
would revolve around players 
such as Jason Terry and Andrew Bynum, respectively.
Trading Howard allows 
the Magic to get something 
for their elite center. If the 
team waits until the end of 
the season, the best they can 
hope for is a nice sign and 
deal that gets them some expiring contracts and a draft 
pick. At worst, they let Howard walk away, gaining nothing, a scenario all too familiar 
to Orlando (Shaquille ONeal 
left for Los Angeles after his 
contract expired). But if the 
Magic trades Howard right 
now, the team itself can salvage its season and start to 
restock its talent.
Howard has made things 
dif? cult by publicly stating 
which teams he would sign 
long-term deals with, but its 
still possible for the Magic to 
? nd a good trade. Their front 
of? ce just needs to stop dragging its heels and make the 
most of a bad situation. 
Mens basketball falls at home
ADAM GRUBER
Sports Co-Editor
Last Friday, the Tartans 
hosted the New York University Violets in a rematch of their 
game last month.
The Tartans had previously defeated the Violets 7068, 
with dominant performances 
by sophomore guards Asad 
Meghani and Rashaun Riley and senior forward John 
Duhring.
But this week, the Violets 
came to Pittsburgh for vengeance.
After 12 minutes of neckand-neck basketball, the 
Violets exploded on a 101 
run, as the Tartans defense 
struggled to halt the Violets 
offense. Sophomore forward 
Christian Manoli shot a threepointer in the closing seconds 
of the half, which cut the 
score to 3731, but he was relatively quiet during the rest of 
the night and fouled out later 
in the game.
Riley led the Tartans with 
21 points and Duhring added 
16 of his own, but the team 
still exhibited an inability to 
effectively run the offense 
and get openings consistently. 
In addition to the Violets 63 
percent shooting, the Tartans 
could only muster 42 percent 
shooting during the game.
Behind Rileys offense, the 
Tartans tied the game with 
49 points six minutes into 
the second half, but another 
dominant run by the Violets 
buried the Tartans for good. 
After that 120 run, the 
Tartans never got closer than 
eight points, ending with a 
? nal score of 8876 for the 
Violets.
In order for the Tartans to 
end this season with a string 
of conference victories, they 
need to clean up their offensive execution.
Despite the defeat, there 
was a signi? cant amount of 
fans in attendance. It was 
a great Friday night atmosphere, with so many students 
cheering on both our men and 
womens teams. It is always 
good when the players have 
[that] kind of support, said 
Josh Centor, the Tartans  assistant director of athletics.
The mens basketball team 
played the Brandeis University Judges yesterday in Skibo 
Gymnasium. The game ended 
in another defeat for the Tartans, as the Judges scored a 
shot at the buzzer in overtime 
that gave them the 7776 win.
After back-to-back clutch 
baskets by Duhring and free 
throws by sophomore guard 
Sean Brophy, the Tartans 
were up three points during 
overtime. After two missed 
free throws by the Tartans, 
the Judges scored a basket 
that broke the hearts of Carnegie Mellon fans. Brandeis 
senior guard Tyrone Hughes 
hit a shot against Meghanis 
defense.
Our guys played tremendously hard. We battled back 
and put ourselves in a positon 
to win. Unfortunately things 
didnt go our way at the end, 
Centor said.
Duhring led the Tartans 
in this game with 21 points, 
but it was senior forward Joe 
Kromka whose clutch play 
sent the game into overtime. 
After two free throws tied the 
game in the fourth quarter, 
Kromka blocked a shot that 
prevented the Judges from 
winning the game during 
regulation time. Manoli and 
Meghani added 17 and 13 
points, respectively.
On Friday, the Tartans will 
play an away game against 
Washington University in St. 
Louis, who is leading the University Athletics Association 
conference.

Carnegie Mellons swimming and diving team participated in its last meet before 
the University Athletic Association (UAA) championships this past Saturday at the 
University of Pittsburgh. The 
womens team defeated three 
of its four competitors: Clarion 
University, Grove City College, 
and California University of 
Pennsylvania.
The mens team emerged 
victorious against Grove City 
College and Clarion University. However, both teams fell 
to Pitt.
Saturday was the swimming and diving teams ? rst 
meet since starting taper 
the previous Monday, a new 
routine that shortens practices 
during the week so the athletes feel more rested and have 
more energy for their meet at 
the end of the week.
Sophomore Megan Garvey, who has been swimming 
consistently well throughout 
her second season with Tartan 
athletics, placed fourth in the 
100-yard butter? y on Saturday. 
According to Garvey, she 
hopes to place within the top 
eight in the 100- and 200-yard 
butter? y events at this years 
UAA championships, and 
eventually go on to the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) championships.
Junior Breanna Stillo, who 
also competed against Pitt 
last Saturday, enjoyed racing 
against the Division I and II 
schools at the meet.
As we approach our UAA 
championship, Im really looking forward to seeing how 
well our team can do. It was 
an awesome experience being part of the ? rst Carnegie 
Mellon womens relay team to 
go to Nationals last year, so it 
would be great to send an even 
larger group of people this 
year, she said.
Stillo placed third in the 
100-yard breaststroke race. 
Earlier this season, Stillo set 
the school record for the 100-
yard breaststroke with a time 
of 1:05.96 at the Top Performance meet hosted by Kenyon 
College.
On the mens team, junior 
Brandon Yee came in ? rst in 
the 200-yard butter? y event 
with a time of 1:54.04, with 
junior Daniel Glaser-Garbrick 
following in third place in 
1:57.88. Brandon Yee had a 
season-best time of 52.31 in 
the 200-yard backstroke, placing third in the race. He continues to prepare for the upcoming UAA conference meet, 
and said that he hopes to make 
it to the NCAA championship.
First-year Andrew Yee 
placed ? rst in the 500-yard 
freestyle with a time of 
4:42.58, and was second 
in the 1,000-yard freestyle 
with his season-best time of 
9:46.33. As a newcomer to the 
team this year, Andrew Yee 
said that he enjoyed the winter training trip in Miami, Fl., 
where the team not only tested 
its physical strength with a rigorous practice schedule that 
lasted nearly two weeks, but 
also became much closer as 
teammates.
Overcome with illness 
during the week, ? rst-year 
Anton Razanav looks to the 
upcoming UAA meet as well 
as Nationals later this year. 
With the UAA championship 
coming up soon, I am hoping 
to post some good times that 
place me as a strong opponent 
in ? nals. If my times allow me 
pass to Nationals in March, 
then I can hope to improve 
even further, Razanav said.
The swimming and diving 
team will be in action again 
at the UAA championships at 
Case Western Reserve University. The meet will begin on 
Feb. 15 and ? nish on Feb. 18.

Mens tennis sweeps ? rst match 90
ALEX TAPAK
Sports Co-Editor
This past Saturday, the 
Carnegie Mellon mens tennis team kicked off its spring 
season with a home match 
against West Virginia Wesleyan College, a Division II 
college. 
The Tartans continued to 
train in their off-season, with 
increased conditioning and 
lifting sessions. 
Their season of? cially 
started two weeks ago, and 
the teams hard work paid off 
with a 90 victory. 
The Tartans came out 
strong against the West Virginia Wesleyan Bobcats, and 
took the lead 30 after doubles. Senior Jeremy King and 
? rst-year Thomas Cooper, the 
No. 2 pair, had the ? rst win 
with an 83 victory. 
The next win came from 
the No. 1 duo of junior Duke 
Miller and ? rst-year Will 
Duncan, with a score of 85. 
Finishing the doubles set at 
a score of 84 was the No. 3 
pair, ? rst-years Christian Heaney-Secord and Bryce Beisswanger.
It was a great way to start 
off the season, Cooper said. 
Jeremy and I played really 
well together.
In singles play, Miller dominated at No. 1 singles and 
was ? rst off the court with a 
decisive 61, 61 victory. Following shortly after Miller 
was Duncan, the No. 4 singles 
player, with 62 and 63 wins. 
Duncans match sealed the 
Tartans victory.
Junior Jooho Yu, at No. 6 
singles, added a 61, 61 win 
and put the Tartans at a 60 
lead over the Bobcats. Junior 
Harsha Rao, No. 3 singles, and 
King, No. 5 singles, were next 
off the court. Rao won his 
match 64, 63, while King 
won 62, 63.
With the Tartans leading 80, the last match was 
Heaney-Secord at No. 2 singles. Heaney-Secord was out 
for the duration of the Fall 
2011 season with a concussion. However, he prevailed in 
three sets with scores of 26, 
63, and 63 and ? nished the 
Tartans sweep over the Bobcats.
Im really happy to be back 
on the court and a part of the 
team, Heaney-Secord said, 
concerning his break from last 
season.
I was really impressed 
with the quality of our doubles for such an early season 
match, especially given the 
fact that we started four freshmen in the doubles lineup, 
said head coach Andrew Girard. Doubles success is going to be a key for us to make 
the NCAAs this year, so it was 
great to see us get off to a 
strong start in that area.

SPORTS COMMENTARY
Super Bowl XLVI
ADAM GRUBER
Sports Co-Editor
Its dj vu all over again. 
That famous quote by the 
Yankees Yogi Berra could not 
be more appropriate, even 
if it regards a different sport 
and a different era.
Almost mirroring the 
events of Super Bowl XLII, 
the New York Giants beat 
the favored New England 
Patriots in Super Bowl XLVI 
in Indianapolis. On the coattails of a terri? c fourth quarter drive by quarterback Eli 
Manning, a de? ning catch 
reminiscent of David Tyrees, 
and a game-sealing sack, the 
Giants pulled out the upset.
Patriots quarterback Tom 
Brady was looking to cement 
himself into an even higher 
echelon of great quarterbacks, but instead Manning 
made his way to Hall of Fame 
consideration. The Giants 
stand alone at the top of the 
NFL, defeating the Patriots 
with a ? nal score of 2117.
It seemed like the Patriots 
had the Giants number during the ? rst three quarters. 
After a good start in the ? rst 
half by the Giants, their respected defensive line could 
not stop the short, quick passing plan of Patriots offensive 
coordinator Bill OBrien and 
head coach Bill Belichick. It 
essentially negated the dominant Giants pass rush, allowing the Patriots a touchdown 
at the end of the ? rst half.
In that half, the Giants 
scored on a questionable 
safety call via intentional 
grounding in the end zone by 
Brady and on a Manning pass 
to wide receiver Victor Cruz. 
Regardless, the Patriots appeared to have the edge. 
The third quarter was 
similar to the ? rst half. An aggressive, quick passing game 
by New England helped the 
Patriots score their second 
touchdown, and sloppy play 
by New York, including two 
fumbles, pointed to a Giants 
collapse.
However, in the fourth 
quarter, the Giants snapped 
out of it, and Manning did his 
best Brady impression. Brady, 
who has seven career fourthquarter comebacks in the 
postseason, is considered one 
of the greatest clutch quarterbacks ever to play the game. 
Manning may now be considered in that conversation.
At the 3:46 mark in the 
fourth quarter, the Giants 
? nal drive began with the 
score sitting 1715, advantage Patriots. A 38-yard pass 
from Manning down the sideline in double coverage was 
cradled in by wide receiver 
Mario Manningham, as he   
barely kept his feet in bounds.
After eight plays of pinpoint passing by Manning 
and physical play from the 
offensive line and wide receivers, running back Ahmad Bradshaw ran up the 
middle, turned around, and 
sat hindquarter-? rst into 
the end zone. The Patriots 
allowed the Giants a touchdown, in hopes of preventing 
them from running down the 
clock, thereby preventing a 
Patriots ? nal drive.
That last drive ended 
poorly for New England. A 
sack by Pro-Bowl defensive 
end Justin Tuck crushed any 
remaining momentum for 
the Patriots. One last heave 
by Brady ended with the ball 
hitting the grass of the end 
zone, as the outstretched 
arms of the Patriots tight end 
Rob Gronkowski extended 
about a foot short of winning. 
Manning is now the 11th 
multi-Super Bowl winning 
quarterback. This win secures him the elite status that 
was so heavily questioned by 
the media earlier this season. It puts him ahead of his 
brother Peyton, who has received more praise as a quarterback throughout both of 
their careers.
Brady is already in the 
realm of greatness. However, a victory in Super Bowl 
XLVI would have tied him 
with Terry Bradshaw and 
Joe Montana with four Super 
Bowl titles. Now people are 
left questioning if Spygate, 
where Belichick was accused 
of spying on opposing coaches play-calling, was the reason for his three Super Bowl 
victories. Since Spygate, 
Brady is 02 on the biggest 
stage.
The fact of the matter is 
that Brady and Manning both 
played unbelievable games. 
But it was Mannings supporting cast that put the Giants over the top. Giants head 
coach Tom Coughlin runs a 
tight ship in New York, and it 
showed in Indianapolis. 
Super Bowl XLVI is over, 
with the Giants reigning supreme  twice in four years. 
It could not have been put better than Giants running back 
Brandon Jacobs: We decapitated them. Call it what you 
want, but the Giants are the 
Super Bowl champions once 
again.
ATHLETE PROFILEBen Nealy pushes forward into season
ALEX TAPAK
Sports Co-Editor
Ben Nealy, a junior on the 
Carnegie Mellon track team, 
hails from Egg Harbor Township 
in New Jersey, where he began 
running in his junior year of 
high school.
Currently, Nealy runs middle 
distances  400 meters and 800 
meters. Since joining the team, 
Nealy has enjoyed being a varsity athlete at Carnegie Mellon. 
Having chosen the option of 
going to an academically competitive school, while also being 
able to balance being an athlete 
as well is a great experience, 
Nealy said.
Although track is not a team 
sport in the traditional sense, 
Nealy spends a lot of time with 
his teammates. Ben is a team 
player who not only likes to push 
his teammates but be pushed by 
them, said track coach Dario 
Donatelli.
His teammates agree, and 
value Nealys ambitions for the 
team as a whole. Bens greatest qualities as an athlete are 
his commitment and ambition, 
said junior Evan Gates, one of 
Nealys teammates. Each year 
he has trained harder than the 
previous by logging more miles 
and workouts. As a result, he 
continuously improves and entices others to train harder, too. 
Ben is a great teammate because 
he leads by example and places 
a high value on the success of 
the team.
Nealys a great teammate 
to have. He adds a lot to the 
goofy team personality, works 
hard, runs fast, and does so 
with swagger. Its hard to not get 
along with Ben; hes fast, fun, 
and friendly, said junior Billy 
Little? eld, one of Nealys teammates.
Unsurprisingly, Nealy has set 
high expectations and goals for 
this years team. I think our current team is a lot better than last 
years team, he said. We have 
the talent to place ? rst at UAAs 
this year, that should be our goal 
as a team, and I hope to contribute to that goal.
Nealy takes pride in his 
training and competition, and 
basks in his teams success. My 
proudest moment on the team 
was coming from behind to beat 
Case Western Reserve University by a point last year, Nealy 
said.
As for when the team is in between training and meets, Nealy 
described the chemistry among 
teammates and how they relax. 
There are entirely too many 
[funny moments] to choose 
from. There are so many great 
personalities on the team, youre 
always in for a good laugh, he 
said. After meets, he and his 
teammates love to indulge in 
pizza. Post-meet pizza. Theres 
nothing like binging on pizza after a long day on the track.
Since track meets are often 
long, Nealy loves to play games 
in between sets to entertain 
himself. I enjoy playing board 
games with the team, like Bananagrams, he said.
At Carnegie Mellon, Nealy 
studies economics and public 
policy. In the future, he hopes 
to earn enough money to buy 
Carnegie Mellon an indoor track 
facility.
Womens basketball falls to New York University at home
KATIE KNOX
Junior Staffwriter
Last Friday night, the womens basketball team had a 
chance to sweep the New York 
University Violets after defeating them on Jan. 17.
That January victory was 
the ? rst time the Tartans had 
defeated the Violets since 
2003. However, the Tartans 
fell to the Violets last Friday 
6857.
After starting the game off 
strong, the Tartans efforts 
were stymied by the visiting 
team, who was ready to return 
the favor.
The win for the Violets 
ended their six-game losing 
streak, while Fridays loss 
brought the Tartans overall 
record to 712 this season.
Carnegie Mellon matched 
NYU shot for shot from the 
? eld, as the Tartans made 20 
of 61 ? eld goal attempts compared to the Violets, who went 
21 for 61.
Neither team was able to 
? nd much success from behind the arc, as each team 
made only ? ve three-point 
shots in 21 attempts.
The deciding factor of the 
game boiled down to freethrows.
The Violets reached the 
free throw line 30 times in the 
contest and made all but nine 
attempts.
Carnegie Mellon only made 
12 out of 16 attempts from the 
charity stripe.
The lack of trips to the freethrow line is attributed to execution on the offensive end of 
the ? oor.
What were missing is a 
sense of consistency on offense. Its ? nding our spots, 
getting open spots, and making the extra pass, said ? rstyear guard Gabrielle West.
Junior forward Emily Peel 
was once again at the forefront 
of Carnegie Mellons offensive 
attack. Peel scored a record 19 
points on 60 percent shooting 
from the ? eld, and 88 percent 
from the free-throw line.
Sophomore guard Jacquie 
Shaw, who scored 11 points, 
was the only other player for 
Carnegie Mellon in the double 
? gures.
However, ? rst-year guard 
Aspen McKeever provided a 
spark from the bench by hitting three three-pointers to 
? nish the game with nine 
points.
Were working on having 
a balanced offensive attack 
from inside out, said junior 
guard Tori Baggio.
The Tartans, who have 
done a great job rebounding 
this season, lost the battle of 
the boards 4148. Peel and 
senior forward Jennifer Larsen combined for 19 total rebounds.
Carnegie Mellon has ? ve 
conference games remaining 
in the season.
Even though the team has 
been defeated in the past by 
its remaining opponents, the 
Tartans are adamant that they 
should not be overlooked. 
They hope to use their tenacity 
to pull off some upsets against 
teams battling for the conference crown.
The UAA is a dif? cult conference, but we are extremely 
con? dent that we can beat any 
team, Peel said. We are making a conscious effort to get 
better every game and every 
practice.
The Tartans took on the  
Brandeis University Judges 
yesterday at home. The Tartans topped the Judges 6556, 
? nally getting revenge for the 
previous loss the week before.
The womens basketball 
team is away this weekend, 
but will return home on Friday, Feb. 17 to host Emory 
University.

Community turns to art activism
Mayor John Fetterman and Swoon discuss art in Braddock
Before he even opens his mouth, John Fetterman 
 the mayor of Braddock, Pa.  is immediately 
interesting. At 6'8'' inches tall, with expansive 
shoulders, a shaved head, goatee, and tattoos 
running up both arms, the Harvard graduate looks 
more like a professional wrestler than a politician  
a fact he joked about during a presentation he gave 
Friday evening in McConomy Auditorium.
Sponsored by AB Lectures, Fettermans presentation 
was followed by an appearance from Caledonia 
Curry, a street artist known as Swoon. Swoon is 
invested in the ongoing urban development project, 
Transformazium, which is being instituted in 
Braddock.
In a weird way, we wouldnt be sitting here right 
now if it wasnt for Braddock, Fetterman began, 
introducing the audience to his town with a series 
of media slides and pictures. In the last several 
decades, de-industrialization has transformed the 
once-prosperous town of 20,000 into a Rust Belt 
ghost town of less than 3,000. Plagued by severe 
economic hardship, nearly every business has fled, 
leaving the buildings to crumble and violence to 
stake its domain.
Weve lost 90 percent of our population. Ninety 
percent of our buildings and businesses are gone  
we are the poorest community in Allegheny County, 
Fetterman said, with an air that communicated his 
resolution to face the towns problems head on.
But then the mood of his presentation shifted. A 
bright picture of smiling youth who had taken 
part in Braddocks summer program filled the 
projection screen and the mayor began to speak 
about the revitalization currently taking place in his 
community.
The re-purposing of abandoned structures, including 
the conversion of the towns First Presbyterian 
Church into a community center; the creation of an 
urban garden on a previously vacant lot; and the 
installation of a 3,000-square-foot playground in 
place of the dilapidated remains of a JC Penney are 
among the improvements made since Fetterman 
took office in 2005.
The mayor, whose dedication to his community is 
evidenced by the tattoos on his forearms  on one 
arm the community zip code, and the dates of the 
five homicides that have taken place in Braddock 
since he took office on the other  has gone as far 
as to contribute his own money to the revitalization 
effort.
Im the guy with the best job in the country, 
Fetterman said. I love what I do, but make no 
mistake, its hard.
In a more recent effort, the town paired up with 
Levi Strauss Jeans for an advertising campaign that 
was filmed in Braddock, featuring actual Braddock 
inhabitants, pumping more than $1 million into the 
community.
Perhaps the most interesting revitalization approach 
taken by Fetterman has been through art. Artists 
see value in circumstances that other people dont, 
he said.
For this reason, artists like Swoon have started to 
play an active role in rebuilding Braddock through 
the Transformazium project. Swoon said that 
she sees art as serving a very important purpose 
in communities, and was attracted to Braddock 
because of her interest in urban farming. The 
street artist, whose diverse projects range from the 
construction of weather-resistant earth-bag domes 
in Haiti to the building of rafts made from New York 
City trash that she then rode down the Mississippi 
River, called Braddock a microcosm of our country.
Along with other artists and activists, Swoon 
has turned her efforts to converting Braddocks 
abandoned United Brethren Church into an artsbased community center, furthering Fettermans 
art-focused community building efforts.
Carnegie Mellon students with interests ranging 
from public policy to the arts attended the lecture, 
and many of them were already aware of the work 
being done by Swoon and Fetterman.
I came because Im a huge fan of Swoons artwork 
and Im also interested in whats going on in 
Braddock, said Christina Lee, a sophomore art 
major.
Sophomore in the Dietrich College of Humanities 
and Social Sciences Celine Berger became familiar 
with Swoon through the Los Angeles Museum of 
Contemporary Arts Art in the Streets show. Im 
really interested in urban redevelopment and street 
art. I found out about Braddock from the Levis Jeans 
commercials, she said.

Advice for awkward people
Dear Patrick,
I dont have a lot of facial 
hair. All of my friends 
make fun of me for it, 
asking when Im going 
to go through puberty 
and if I have alopecia. Its 
getting pretty tiresome. 
How can I get more facial 
hair?
Thanks,
Shaving Attempts 
Lacking, Virtually 
Obsolete
Dear SALVO,
Sadly, you have not gotten 
the Gift of the Beard. It 
is nothing to be ashamed 
of. So what if you have 
less testosterone than 
other guys? That doesnt 
necessarily mean youre 
less of a man. So what if 
youre not allowed near 
playgrounds during NoShave November? A thin, 
stringy moustache doesnt 
make you a creep  it just 
makes you look like one. 
In fact, beards can be a 
curse. You wake up every 
morning looking like a 
lumberjack. You shave, but 
? ve minutes later youre 
covered in stubble. You 
forget to shave a couple 
days before Halloween, and 
everyone thinks youre going 
as Teen Wolf. Its a burden. 
If you must persist in your 
quest, then you should know 
theres no real way (short of 
gluing hair to your face) to 
get a beard. Accept it for 
now, and maybe in a few 
years youll be capable of 
growing one. Unless your 
dad cant either: Then youre 
out of luck.
Youll shave a bundle on 
razors,

Dear Patrick,
My friend got hit by a car 
the other day. Shes ? ne; 
she has a bruise on her

She was walking across

Is there anything I can do 
to help her in her hour of 
need?
Thanks,

Dear SPEEDBUMP,
Im glad to hear your friends 
okay. Its times like these 
when we have to remember 
that jaywalking is a crime 
for a reason. Your friend is a 
criminal. Though, admittedly, 
drivers in Pittsburgh are 
terrible, which is why 
pedestrians have to be extra 
careful. Pittsburghers tend to 
ignore things like red lights, 
crosswalks, and turn signals.
When crossing the street, 
remember these three 
easy steps: stop, look, and 
listen. Your friend must 
have missed that day of ? rst 
grade, so the best thing 
you could get her would be 
an e-card with those tips 
on it. Perhaps cross-stitch 
them a kitschy-yet-helpful 
household knickknack. Try 
buying her a bright orange 
vest with re? ectors. Its safe 
and fashionable! Being hit 
by a car is no joke, so you 
de? nitely shouldnt make 
jokes about it to her. She 
could have been seriously 
hurt!
Or buy her Bengay,
Patrick Hoskins

Pregnancy, incest, suicide, and rape  every 
controversial issue was included in the Pittsburgh 
Musical Theaters (PMT) performance of Spring 
Awakening this past Friday at the Byham theater. Spring 
Awakening is the musical adaptation of a banned 1891 
German play, featuring a chilling folk-infused, alternative 
rock score by composer Duncan Sheik.
The plot focuses on a group of disquieted teenagers 
living in a small town in Victorian Germany. As the 
characters sexual feelings begin to stir, they ? nd 
themselves ? ghting their tyrannous adult superiors and 
the rigid, conservative belief system of their society. The 
play  which deals with emerging sexual desires, loss of 
virginity, homosexuality, teen suicide, botched abortion, 
masturbation, child abuse, shame, and death  won 
eight Tony Awards (including Best Musical) after its 
original Broadway debut in 2006.
Although Spring Awakening is a dark and emotionally 
demanding show, PMTs mostly college-aged cast gave 
a Broadway-caliber performance. Kathlene Queen, a 
PMT veteran, began the show as Wendla, singing the 
haunting opening number that pulled the audience in 
and set the tone for the rest of the show. Logan Williams, 
a senior at Robert Morris University, played the strongwilled, rebellious Melchior and, hitting each note 
decisively, had perhaps the most memorable voice of the 
evening.
As the lead roles, Queen and Williams had remarkable 
chemistry together. They brought a sense of urgency 
and honesty to their fragile relationship on stage as two 
sheltered and confused teenagers in love. This chemistry 
was demonstrated during the love-making scene at the 
end of Act I, the most important and powerful scene of 
the show. The scene is very explicit: Both actors showed 
some skin and pretended to have sex on stage, and the 
audience watched as Williams character simulated 
acts of sexual foreplay before he and Wendla made love. 
Although this scene de? nitely has the potential to be 
awkward on stage, Williams and Queen delivered a 
realistic, raw, and moving performance.
Jameson Corrie played Moritz Stiefel, Melchiors troubled 
best friend who struggles with school. In addition 
to adding some comedy to this otherwise serious 
production, Corrie did a great job performing the unique 
choreography of Spring Awakening. During The Bitch 
of Living, a song about boys anguish in suppressing 
their sexual desires, Corrie and the other schoolboys 
jumped around stage haphazardly, stomping their feet 
and rocking air guitars.
Another outstanding performance was accomplished 
by Adrianne Knapp, who played Ilse. She is a societal 
outcast who ran away from home because her father 
beat her, only to run into the arms of another abusive 
man from a Bohemian colony.
Although the majority of the cast was composed of 
adolescents, two adults were responsible for playing all 
of the adult roles  including parents, teachers, and 
the clergy  to symbolically demonstrate the adults as 
formulaic and identical. Barbara Burgess-Lefebvre, a 
Robert Morris University theater professor, took on all of 
the female adult roles, while Brady Patsy, who teaches 
at PMTs Richard E. Rauh Conservatory, played the 
male adults. Both did a terri? c job of demonstrating the 
struggle between youth and adults in society.
PMTs production of Spring Awakening stood out with 
its simple and personal style. The show was performed 
on a rectangular platform with no set or props other than 
an arrangement of wooden chairs, which were moved 
around and set up by the cast members themselves. 
Instead of a traditional orchestra, Spring Awakening 
boasted a rock band that played onstage behind the 
platform. The band was led by music director Tim 
Marquette, and it kept audience members tapping their 
toes for the entire show. But perhaps the most innovative 
aspect of Spring Awakening is that there were actually 
limited seats on the stage, allowing audience members 
to be a part of the show and experience the story in a 
whole new way.
When the curtain was drawn, Spring Awakening opened 
its audience to a world everybody knows. Whether you 
are currently an adolescent or an adult reminiscing on 
your past, you will connect with the honest, heartfelt 
characters fumbling on stage in attempts to ? nd love 
and a good life. Although Spring Awakening is ? lled with 
comical and lighthearted scenes, the show ultimately 
forces the audience to face a myriad of challenges 
present in society today.
Most importantly, the production daringly compares our 
modern society to Puritanical 19th-century Germany, 
compelling us to be aware of the troubles that continue 
to haunt our world.
Spring Awakening is a musical everyone should see, and 
PMT offered an impressive production of the show. The 
show does contain strong language and explicit content. 
However, if that notion bothers you, it is perhaps all the 
more reason to go see it.

On Variety
Around this time last year, Mirko Azis and I explained in 
this very column why minimal music is the richest, most 
compelling form of music. If you read the article, Im sure 
you were convinced that we were, in fact, correct, and 
thus immediately made Gestalt psychology the primary 
force in your life. For this, dear reader, I raise my glass to 
you in congratulations.
A year later, Im here to tell you that while minimal music 
is the pinnacle of clear, succinct, and meticulously crafted 
music, there are other types of music that I enjoy.
As a society, we often forget the importance of a little 
variety in our lives. It changes our routines. It adds 
that extra element of surprise and wonder. And, most 
importantly, its not perfectly minimal. There are so many 
wonderfully fantastic things out there, so why should we 
discard everything but the essential? My writing partner 
from last year may not agree entirely, but Im here to tell 
you that there is no good reason why you only need to 
listen to one or two types of music.
Have you ever heard the sounds of the ever-so-free jazz 
composer Sun Ra or the American blues shouter music 
of Wynonie Harris? How about the rhymes of the lyrically 
talented hip-hop group Jurassic 5?
My point is simple: Regardless of genre, there are so many 
great artists and musicians out there to discover.
Fortunately, WRCT makes it easy for you. From Feb. 10 at 
noon until Feb. 12 at midnight, WRCT will broadcast halfhour segments of music, each dedicated to one particular 
artist or band. In addition to this, I highly recommend 
looking into websites like last.fm that track all of the music 
you consume and allow you to see what your friends 
are listening to. I sometimes spend hours listening to my 
friends libraries and, through this, my obsession with 
minimal music is slowly dwindling.

New album from of Montreal
Paralytic Stalks signals bands entry into adulthood
The last paradigm shift for the band of Montreal 
was signaled by the release of Hissing Fauna, Are 
You the Destroyer? in 2007. The album abandoned 
the escapist neo-psychedelia that had de? ned of 
Montreals early work in favor of deeply personal 
songs revolving around lead singer, songwriter, and 
multi-instrumentalist Kevin Barnes separation from 
his wife. These songs explore the less glamorous 
aspects of human consciousness.
Hissing Fauna also introduced Georgie Fruit  
Barnes 40-year-old, African-American, transsexual, 
funk-playing alter-ego  who dominated the latter 
half of the album and all of the bands next two 
albums.
Under Fruits musical guidance, of Montreals music 
morphed into a mesh of R&B, cock rock, funk, 
and pop loaded with self-deprecating hedonistic 
fantasies that would make Prince blush. While 
this shift toward hypersexuality was somewhat 
refreshing in 2007  when indie bands were polite, 
prudish, and doe-eyed  times have changed.
In the past ? ve years, indie has grown to be edgier 
and more rebellious, and the shock value that 
accompanied of Montreals sexy and self-examining 
musical style has dissipated. But when False Priest 
was released in 2009, it was clear that Barnes was 
still strongly attached to the idea of his alter-ego.
Paralytic Stalks, the groups newest album, was 
a crossroads for the indie veterans: Would they 
continue making gimmicky shock music or would 
they evolve into a band that could distinguish itself 
in the growing indie community?
Upon listening to Paralytic Stalks, of Montreals 
decision is resoundingly clear: Fruit is dead. 
The opening track, Gelid Ascent, recon? gures 
expectations with expansive space-rock drenched 
in an aura of sinister dread. The songs Spiteful 
Intervention and Wintered Death both feature 
arrangements reminiscent of the classically 
in? uenced infancy of progressive rock while Ye, 
Renew the Plaintiff begins with the bright, funktinged sound of Skeletal Lamping and False Priest 
before falling into more psychedelic guitar-centered 
rock.
While it is sometimes dif? cult to determine the 
in? uences of the bands new sound, it is clear that 
the group has not lost its sense of musical versatility, 
nor the preternatural darkness that emerged in 
Hissing Fauna.
The biggest development on Paralytic Stalks, 
however, is of Montreals newfound fondness for 
sonic manipulation. The group does not manipulate 
sound the same way that post-punk and psychedelic 
rock did by making use of space, but rather by 
incorporating seemingly random spurts of noise and 
chopped up samples.
This is most salient on Exorcismic Breeding 
Knife and Authentic Pyrrhic Remission, which 
both feature extended sections of cacophonous 
noise. If Hissing Fauna was the moment at which 
of Montreal emerged from the nave innocence of 
childhood, then Paralytic Stalks signals the bands 
entry into adulthood: It is focused, jaded, ambitious, 
yet experienced enough to know that there is such a 
thing as too much sex.
Paralytic Stalks will be released on Tuesday.

Unbeknownst to many, Pittsburgh has a vibrant 
independent comics scene. With over seven comics 
shops and the ToonSeum, a museum wholly dedicated 
to animation and comics, Pittsburgh is home to a 
lot of comics a? cionados. With homegrown comics 
anthologies like Andromeda and Unicorn Mountain 
alongside comics giants like Jim Rugg, Frank Santoro, 
and Tom Scioli, theres a lot of ink hitting the page in 
this city.
In the midst of this community is Ed Piskor. A workhorse 
of a cartoonist, Piskor has made great strides in the 
world of professional comics over the past seven years 
and has opened up this medium for storytelling. Piskors 
comics tell a range of stories, from the passions and 
politics of hackers to re? ections on life in Cleveland to 
the borderline biblical history of hip-hop culture.
Piskor was born in the city of Homestead, Pa. in 1982. 
Piskor said that money was tight growing up, but pencils 
and paper were easy to come by. Determined to pursue 
a future in comics after high school, he made his way to 
the Joe Kubert School of Cartoon and Graphic Art, where 
he studied the ins and outs of comics creation.
He has been a professional cartoonist since 2005, having 
entered the world of publication by collaborating as 
an illustrator with comic book writer Harvey Pekar for 
his American Splendor comics. Their collaboration 
continued as they worked on two subsequent graphic 
novels: Macedonia, the story about the travels of a peace 
activist, and The Beats, the story of the generation 
that opposed mainstream American conformity and 
conservatism.
After the collaborative work, Piskor began to focus more 
on working solo  writing, penciling, lettering, and 
inking his comics himself. As a cartoonist, Piskor has 
found a writing style that appeals to unique audiences. 
His recent works include Brain Rot and Wizzywig, 
which is the story of Kevin Boingthump Phenicle, a 
young prodigy who becomes fascinated with social 
engineering, phone phreaking, and computer hacking. 
Piskor has engaged audiences outside of comics 
traditional demographic by writing about these unusual 
topics and using the internet to expand his fan base.
While Piskor was creating Wizzywig, he would regularly 
post the story online for fans to read. The work caught 
on with technophiles; Piskor was suddenly invited to 
technology conventions like The Next HOPE (a Hackers 
on Planet Earth convention) and was given the 
opportunity to speak at hackerspaces.
More recently, the Hip Hop Family Tree segment of the 
Brain Rot series has been developing a highly interactive 
online fan base. Little-known ? gures in the history of 
hip-hop culture, like DJ Disco Wiz, have been getting 
in touch with Piskor via Facebook and responding to 
his historical depictions of the 1970s hip-hop world. 
When asked about the purpose of the Hip Hop Family 
Tree, which traces the history of hip-hop culture, Piskor 
laughed and explained that this sprawling project is just 
an excuse to put the family tree ? owchart together.
If you really get into the old records and the music 
from the beginning, Piskor said, throughout the years 
you can draw these very clear lines between each 
generation. It is almost like the Bible. Grandmaster Flash 
begat Grandmaster Melle Mel, Kool Herc begat DJ Disco 
Wiz ... and so on.
Piskor is often asked what kind of research he does for 
his historical stories. He responds seriously that to 
say research makes the work seem like a homework 
assignment. As he sees it, he has been building on his 
memory bank of knowledge since he was a kid. If he has 
to delve further than his own knowledge in order to fully 
tell a story, he never sees it as researching but rather as 
reading for pleasure.
To keep himself drawing, he incorporates his passions 
into his current projects, personal or professional. For 
example, when he became curious about the worlds of 
verboten information, hacking, and breaking systems, 
he wanted to delve deep into them so as to understand 
the nuts and bolts. In order to justify the time and energy 
needed to reach this level of comprehension, he made 
Wizzywig, a 300-page comic. I feel like a slacker if Im 
not working constantly, he said.
Although his approaches to the creative process might 
seem extreme and obsessive, Piskors tireless work in 
communicating his learnings through comics provide his 
readers with portals into curious worlds.

Last weekend at Heinz Hall, the Pittsburgh Symphony 
Orchestra (PSO) performed Antonin Dvorks Biblical 
Songs and Johannes Brahms A German Requiem 
as part of its Music for the Spirit concert series. The 
program, which offers two concerts per season, presents 
music that is meant to spread a spiritual and universal 
message, according to the PSOs website.
Although Friday nights program consisted of two works 
featuring verse from the Bible, Christianity only served 
as the lens through which the featured composers 
explored the ideas of life, death, and resurrection. Both 
composers picked scripture in their native languages 
(Czech for the Dvork piece and German for the Brahms 
piece) that does not dwell in fear and mourning, but 
rather in celebration and fond remembrance of those 
who have passed.
The program opened with Dvorks Biblical Songs, 
which were written after the deaths of his two friends, 
fellow composers Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky and Hans 
von Blow. Internationally renowned baritone Thomas 
Hampson sang with assurance, and his voice carried 
effortlessly over the orchestra. His clear diction and tone 
served the dif? culty of the Czech language very well. 
The PSO, under the baton of artistic director Manfred 
Honeck, accompanied Hampson beautifully. The 
orchestra delivered the traditional Czech music within 
Dvorks composition without grandeur, acknowledging 
the timeless beauty inherent in a simple folk dance.
The highlight of the program, however, was Brahms 
Requiem. The Mendelssohn Choir of Pittsburgh and 
soprano soloist Chen Reiss joined the symphony, 
Honeck, and Hampson for this hour-long masterwork. 
Brahms wrote the piece while mourning the loss of his 
mother, as well as that of his mentor and dear friend 
Robert Schumann.
Brahms conception of the work was unique in that he 
avoided the traditional Latin text for his requiem  thus 
the title A German Requiem. He also refrained from 
using the standard requiem text; instead, he selected 
passages from the German Luther Bible that are meant 
to offer comfort to those in mourning, making this a 
requiem not for the dead, but for the living.
The composition is a personal one, and the music is 
distinctly Brahmsian: The polyphonic texture is thick 
and layered, and the music is deeply affecting and 
unsettling.
The Brahms piece required much more from the 
orchestra than did the Dvork, and the PSO did 
a wonderful job of supporting the chorus without 
overpowering it. Although there were a few moments 
when the chorus and orchestra did not seem to be on 
the same page, Honeck was quick to reel them in and 
continue, hardly missing a beat.
Hampson shined in Requiem, especially in the sixth 
movement, singing with stunning gravity not heard 
in Dvorks Biblical Songs. Reiss solo spanned a wide 
emotional range: sublime and sweet one moment, 
? erce and dramatic the next. The interplay among 
the orchestra, choir, and soloists was incredibly warm 
and well balanced, producing a seamless and organic 
performance.

American Beauty is, on the surface, 
a very basic movie. It follows a 
suburban family consisting of a slightly 
depressed father, a materialistic wife 
with monogamy issues, and a daughter 
looking to explore her sexual side. 
However, this ? lm is so much more 
than that. It is about seeing beauty in 
the world and being happy with the 
knowledge that you still have the ability 
to surprise yourself. Oscar-winner for 
Best Picture and Best Director in 
2000, American Beauty is extraordinarily 
written  a classic of American cinema. 
Real Steel
Friday, Feb. 10
7:30 10 12:30
This movie can be summed up as an 
adult version of Rock Em Sock Em 
Robots. Real Steel tells of a future 
in which human boxers have been 
replaced with robot boxers. While this 
could have been an awesome lead 
for a story of a robot that breaks free 
from its programming and starts a war 
against humanity, the robots just beat 
each other up the entire movie. Hugh 
Jackman is the protagonist as a robot 
owner trying to make it big in the boxing 
world. While not quite Rocky with 
Robots, as some reviews have stated, 
this is a well-made ? lm with a bona? de 
action star.

Possibly the strangest ? lm choice to

prequel to the original box-of? ce hit. 
Set 18 years prior to the ? rst movie, this 
one also revolves around a husband 
and wife whose children befriend an 
invisible entity living in their home. 
Terrifying, right? The movie is shot in the 
same homemade footage style as the 
previous two and, while it may seem like 
it has been overdone, theres not much 
out there that can give genuine, realistic 
scares like this franchise. Fun Fact: 
Made on a budget of just $5 million, 
the ? ick has grossed over $200 million 
worldwide.

The School of Drama may seem exclusive to non-majors, 
but spend ? ve minutes in the sprawling, sensory world 
of Playground Festival and you realize just how open it 
is. Playground is a free, creative environment for drama 
students to explore other mediums for their art and 
showcase their independent works.
This year marked the ninth annual Playground Festival, 
which ran from last Thursday through Saturday in the 
Purnell Center for the Arts. Playground is a massive 
event that transforms all of Purnell into a spectacular 
fantasy world, with experimental installations and 
performances happening all day.
Playground provides students with an opportunity to 
push themselves and work on interdisciplinary projects. 
Its a sectioned-out time of the year when [drama 
students] dont have to worry about classes  because 
all [drama] classes are canceled  and they can just 
focus on creating new work, work that theyre interested 
in, said sophomore directing major Cameron Margeson.
Playground is one of the highlights of the year for many 
drama students, and they start thinking about their 
Playground pieces months in advance. In October, 
they pitch their ideas and begin writing scripts. 
Actual rehearsals dont begin until the Sunday before 
Playground, however, so students only have three days 
to prepare.
One of the largest learning components of Playground 
is the tight time constraint. You have three days to 
create anywhere from a 15-minute to 45-minute piece, 
so you have to learn whats necessary in order to create 
something, Margeson said. You learn new techniques 
when youre so pressed to create something.... You have 
to sort of work outside of your own habits to get things 
done.
While students have just a few days to put together 
their pieces, their enthusiasm often turns their pieces 
into extended projects; many continue working on their 
pieces throughout the festival.
First-year drama student Will Gossett created an 
installation piece titled Volumetric Display for his 
? rst Playground this year. Gossetts piece is a media 
installation that projects three-dimensional and moving 
images in its display area  which is made of carefully 
arranged, clear, vertical strings. Moreover, Volumetric 
Display runs on open source software. Im in the 
process of writing my own content to add to this loop 
of different shows, Gossett said on Thursday night. It 
took so long to get [the structure] built that I didnt have 
time to get that [coding] done before the opening, but 
tonight Im going to work on it more.
Senior directing major Miranda Steege was this years 
installation curator and was in charge of coordinating 
the installation works with the Playground Festival 
Committee. Installations are a great way to do 
something you dont normally do, Steege said. Because 
thats not at all what most of our classwork is like, so its 
sort of a chance to push beyond what we do in class.
This sentiment seems to be a recurring theme 
in Playground: Its a chance for students to push 
themselves out of their comfort zones and challenge 
themselves with work they dont usually have the 
opportunity to do.
Students took advantage of this opportunity, resulting 
in a wide range of performances and installations from 
dance and comedy shows to fully immersive, sensory 
experience installations and murals.
Its absolutely about people challenging themselves, 
said Priscila Garcia, a sophomore directing major. You 
go back and you realize the things youve learned in 
your semesters at Carnegie Mellon ... and then you try

and see how you can incorporate those with things you 
already really know. Its an experiment. It either works or 
it doesnt, and thats that.
The Playground environment is very open to these 
experiments, however, and its all about pushing 
yourself and trying something new. I think its a very 
constructive environment, Garcia said. Its just when 
students are lazy that people become very judgmental, 
which I think is fair.
Margeson also praised the festivals ability to open up 
creative opportunities for drama students: We dont 
always get to study things that are outside of our option. 
So Playground is a time when a designer can direct and 
an actor can design and a director can write. If theres 
anything you want to do that youre not getting from 
classes, Playground is when you do it.
While Playground is an incredibly open environment 
for drama students, its not publicized to the campus 
community and is almost exclusively attended by drama 
students, drama professors, close friends, and family. I 
think we need to settle into it as a community here in 
Purnell before it can expand elsewhere, Garcia said. I 
do think theres a reason for that  I think all of us as 
students want to see each others pieces and there really 
just isnt space for larger audiences.
With a limited supply and a huge demand, tickets for the 
performances are hard to come by. All tickets are free 
and made available the day of the performance. Some 
reservations can be made by faculty and drama students, 
but for the most part, anyone who wants a ticket has 
to wait in line for a couple of hours before the show. 
Tickets are like gold was a common phrase uttered by 
drama students throughout the weekend.
Playground is a festival by drama students, for drama 
students. Despite the events somewhat exclusive 
nature, Playground creates an open and inviting 
opportunity for drama students to express themselves 
and experiment with new mediums.
Summing up the goals of Playground, Margeson said, 
Its not so much to show off the work that you want to 
do, but its a time to really stretch yourself.

When one thinks of the noir genre, its usually in the 
context of cinema. Black and white ? lm, dramatic 
close shots, and a lone man walking away in the rain 
come to mind. Akashic Books breaks away from this 
medium, however, with its series of noir short story 
collections, each set in a speci? c city. One of the 
latest installments in this series is Pittsburgh Noir, 
a collection of short, Pittsburgh-based noir stories 
that showcases the darker side of ? ctional Burgh 
residents.
While many people might think that noir only 
consists of brooding private detectives dealing with 
mysterious female clients, the genre is actually a 
bit more varied than that. Film noir usually includes 
alienated, morally ambiguous heroes; crime; and 
a pessimistic outlook, with its characters often 
placed in unwanted, doomed situations. The 14 
contributing authors to Pittsburgh Noir have taken 
the characteristics of this classic ? lm genre and 
applied them, with varying degrees of success, to 
the short story medium.
These stories take the reader through every nook 
and cranny of Pittsburgh, from the suburbs of Fox 
Chapel to the bars in South Side to a houseboat on 
the Allegheny River. Theres something comfortable 
about reading stories solely set in Pittsburgh  
there is a rush of familiarity and associations when 
the stories mention a place you see or go to all too 
often, like the apartment on North Craig Street 
mentioned in Kathleen Georges Intruder, or 
Pamelas Diner in Squirrel Hill, at which the narrator 
eats in Aubrey Hirschs Cheater. Of course, 
some of that comfort is reduced when that familiar 
location serves as the setting for a grisly murder.
As one would expect from the noir genre, there are 
plenty of murders, but every writer interprets those 
murders differently: Carnegie Mellon professor 
Terrance Hayes delivers a poetic, introspective 
re? ection upon a murder in East Liberty in his story 
Still Air, while Carnegie Mellon professor Hilary 
Masters At the Buena Vista gives a humorous, 
conversational account of a middle-aged man who is 
after the fortune of one of his relatives.
Several of the stories stray rather far from noir 
conventions, which detracts from the books overall 
impact as a noir collection. Carlos Antonio Delgados 
Far Beneath, for instance, is a beautifully written 
 yet disturbing  story from the perspective of 
a nine-year-old boy who begins exploring sexuality 
with his brother. Despite the authors great style, the 
subject matter doesnt seem to relate much to noir. 
Similarly, Homecoming by Kathryn Miller Haines 
gives an account of a World War II soldier coming 
home to his cheating wife, and the story doesnt 
have any identi? able noir characteristics. These 
stories, while well-written, distract from the books 
focus on the noir genre.
Thankfully, the majority of the stories in the 
collection remain on point, like Lila Shaaras ghostly 
Atom Smasher, whose twist ending is guaranteed 
to surprise. Georges Intruder also provides a fresh 
perspective on the classic crime mystery, complete 
with a full cast of interesting characters and a 
modern take on the quintessential femme fatale.

Taylor Mason, a visiting comedian, puts 
on a well-received show for Carnegie 
Mellon students. In his own words, 
Its nice to do a show where the SATs 
are over 400. His jokes are tailored 
to the high-brow humor Carnegie 
Mellon students are sure to appreciate, 
although he does take a stab at the 
University of Pittsburgh.

We all know Carnegie Mellons 
infamous reputation for being a place 
where students never sleep, and a 
SciTech article addresses one way 
students achieve these ridiculous 
hours without dozing off: caffeine. The

the effects of excess caffeine intake, 
including migraines, vomiting, and 
tremors.

A dedicated group of students gathers 
to meet with a task force, started 
in 2005, to discuss the necessity of 
having an official mascot for the school. 
While the Scottish terrier that adorns a 
variety of Tartan paraphernalia is nice, 
students want an official mascot at 
sporting events in order to draw more 
fans to the games.

Appreciation Day, The Tartan asks

use it to wake up fellow students.
