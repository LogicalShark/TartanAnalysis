Pakistani military officials 
staged a coup against the demo
cratically elected government 
last Tuesday. The man spear
heading the effort was General 
Pervez Musharraf, who success
fully ousted Pakistans leader, 
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. 
The coup brought immediate at
tention to itself as people and 
countries around the world be
came deeply concerned about the 
sudden event.
The coup had been a long time 
coming. Musharraf and Sharif 
have constantly been at odds ever 
since they met, but this summer 
the border dispute with India 
caused a downward spiral in the 
already-troubled relationship. 
Pakistani troops and Kashmiri 
irregulars moved across the 
cease-fire line between India and 
Pakistan to occupy various hills. 
India countered aggressively and 
was able to beat them back. Un
der intense international pres
sure, Sharif was forced to with
draw the troops, which angered 
Musharraf and the rest of the 
army. After the border skirmish 
was over, Sharif decided to throw 
out Musharraf and replace him
with another, more controllable 
general. However, army officials 
had already decided to get rid of 
Sharif if he tried to do this.
On Tuesday, Sharif went to the 
headquarters of Pakistan Televi
sion to make his announcement 
about removing Musharraf. He 
had the gates padlocked, just in 
case there was trouble. Within 
half an hour, two truckloads of 
soldiers entered the building and 
captured Sharif. They escorted 
him to his residence and posted 
guards all around the house.
Soldiers proceeded to occupy 
several government buildings. 
Television stations and telephone 
lines went dead. In the capital, 
Islamabad, Cabinet ministers 
were replaced with army officials. 
Leaders of the provincial govern
ments were all put under arrest, 
as was Sharifs family. The army 
also took control of the airport. In 
one day, the military had over
thrown the civilian government.
Musharraf went on the air af
terwards to announce the take
over. He accused Sharifs gov
ernment of destroying the coun
try and bringing the economy 
toward collapse. He established 
a provisional government and 
met with various politicians, 
hinting at who might be in con
trol of the new government.
Countries around the world im
mediately responded to the situ
ation. The U.S. ambassador in 
Pakistan is currently trying to 
meet with military leaders in 
Pakistan to persuade a restora
tion of the democracy. President 
Clinton issued a written state
ment explaining his interest in a 
peaceful return to democracy in 
Pakistan. The Indian government 
is considerably more worried. It 
stepped up troops along the bor
der, which angered the Pakistani 
army. All around the world, coun
tries are monitoring the situa
tion very closely.
On campus, some students have 
paid attention as well. Pakistani 
students in particular are watch
ing the events with a close eye.
Many of them think the coup 
was beneficial for Pakistan. They 
were also highly angered by 
Sharifs rule, saying it was cor
rupt and dictatorial. According 
to these students, Sharif had a 
habit of throwing out anyone that 
didnt obey him or who he didnt 
like. While some agree that a 
civilian government is probably 
better for Pakistans relations 
with foreign countries, they also 
point out that the military is less 
corrupt and more reliable.
It is a known fact that the 
Army is the one and only civilized 
and disciplined entity. They are 
corrupt, but maybe not as much 
as the politicians, said Sameer 
Qureshi, a junior in computer 
science. He said he was and still 
is quite disgusted by Sharifs at
titude and that the so-called 
democratic government was quite 
the opposite of a democracy.

The University Bookstore is 
working to phase in new stu
dent online services to accom
pany an existing faculty text
book requisition service online. 
These services will include 
monitoring book availability 
and eventually the purchasing 
of textbooks over the Web.
The implementation of online 
services began about a year ago 
when faculty were first able to 
place textbook orders on the Web. 
This eliminated the possibility of 
misplacing orders and also clearly 
recorded the date on which the 
order was placed, thus reducing 
confusion and increasing the re
liability and speed of the book
store in filling orders. The next 
phase to be implemented will be
a Web page geared towards stu
dents with textbook information, 
such as course numbers and 
book requirements.
The initial informational 
pieces should begin going into 
place for Spring term. From in
formation-only to full online ecommerce will take a little 
longer.... I would hope we are 
well on our way by next fall. HowPlease see BOOKSTORE, page 4

Tartan News Editor
In an impromptu manner, Janet Reno, 
Attorney General of the United States, 
made an appearance in McConomy Au
ditorium last Tuesday.
Reno, along with Pittsburgh Mayor 
Tom Murphy and a selected group of 
youth and community leaders, discussed 
gun violence. Specifically, the panel dis
cussion was focused on a new initiative 
to combat gun-related violence entitled 
Operation TARGET.
In the last three months we have 
been developing a comprehensive re
sponse that harnesses our collective re
sources, know-how, and determination. 
Today our response is ready, said U.S. 
Attorney Harry Litman, who moderated 
the discussion.
The goal of Operation TARGET, par
tially based on similar initiatives like 
the Boston Gun Project, will be to curb 
gun violence by stepping up law enforce
ment in a collaborative effort between 
agencies. For example, the city will as
sign officers to work with the federal 
department of Alcohol, Tobacco, and 
Firearms (ATF).

helping this nation in the culture of 
violence in this country.
The program will also attempt to reduce 
straw purchasing of guns. This occurs 
when citizens who can clear the manda
tory background check purchase guns and 
then illegally sell them to others.
Murphy said that, 10 or 15 years ago, 
many of the crimes that young people 
commit with guns would have been 
bloody noses if they didnt have access to 
weapons. According to Pittsburgh Bu
reau of Police Chief Robert McNeilly, as 
many as 75 percent of guns have been 
obtained through illegal purchases.
I consider our operation to be very 
legitimate. We are gun dealers for the 
good guys, said Albert Savage, owner of 
a local gun dealership. He said that 
many times it is very difficult to ascer
tain whether or not to sell a gun to a 
citizen. Its an ongoing problem and I 
ask the publics bearing with us. This is 
a trial-and-error period for us too.

Researchers report 
on cancer findings
DURHAM, N.C. (U-WIRE)/T%e 
Chronicle (Duke U.)Researchers at 
the Medical Center have identified a 
subset of patients with advanced 
breast cancer who respond success
fully to the experimental treatment of 
high-dose chemotherapy followed by 
bone marrow transplant.
The controversial results  which 
will appear in the October issue of the 
Journal of Clinical Oncology  could
 assist physicians in selecting patients 
to treat intensively for breast cancer.
In this review, we looked at a wide 
variety of factors that could poten
tially affect a patients chance of suc
cess with intense, high-dose chemo
therapy and bone marrow trans
plant, said lead author Dr. David 
Rizzieri, assistant professor in the 
oncology division of the Duke De
partment of Medicine. That way we 
could identify which metastatic can
cer patients would benefit most from 
the treatment.
The research uses a set of patients 
who were part of a previous study, 
which ran from 1987 to 1995. Of the 
425 patients in the original study, 
researchers were able to discern who 
had a greater chance of success with 
the therapy, and howto improve moni
toring of those patients at high risk for 
recurrence or spreading of the cancer.
The patients were divided into three 
groups based on how they responded 
to the original clinical trial of stan
dard chemotherapy. The progressive 
group  which showed no signs of 
response to the treatmentwas taken 
off chemotherapy. The other two 
groups  the partial responders and
the complete responders  received 
high-dose therapy followed by bone 
marrow transplant.
Up front, everyone was treated the 
same and then they went on a differ
ent path, said Gloria Broadwater, 
co-author of the study and a senior 
statistician at Dukes cancer center.
Although this procedure may 
prove to be extremely beneficial, 
Rizzieri noted that high-dose che
motherapy for breast cancer patients 
is controversial.
Other leaders in the medical com
munity are skeptical about the poten
tial benefits of the study. I think that 
this is a highly charged subject and 
that theres a great deal of smoke 
about the value of this high-dose che
motherapy, said Dr. Laurence Baker, 
director of clinical research at the 
University of Michigan Cancer Cen
ter. The question is whether there is 
any redeeming value in this therapy.
Baker noted that the Duke study is 
consistent with previous studies, which 
indicate that patients with slower dis
ease growth and longer survival will 
respond better to treatment. But thats 
not where the controversy lies, he said.
' Many people dont think that the high 
costs of this treatment are warranted 
given the low number of patients who 
can potentially benefit from it.
Rizzieri recognized some of these 
concerns. This is a small baby step 
forward for some, but it doesnt affect 
all breast cancer patients, he said. 
You combine that with the intensity 
and toxicity of this aggressive treat
ment and some people feel that the 
procedure isnt warranted.

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (U-WIRE)/77ze 
Crimson  Harvard University doesn't 
take American Express.
And it doesnt take Visa or 
Mastercard either when it comes tp 
tuition payments.
Indeed, despite a growing trend in higher 
education to allow students and parents 
to put college payments on plastic, Harvard 
has quietly but firmly maintained a policy 
prohibitingtuition payment by credit card.
The position, according to Director of 
Student Financial Services Nona D. 
Strauss, reflects little more than a de
sire to uphold fairness and the law, and 
not any desire to keep customers from 
enjoying the benefits increasingly lav
ished on some card holders based on 
their level of purchases.
Those benefits can range anywhere 
from free airline tickets on U.S. air car
riers to points redeemable for free din
ing or hotel stays.
Strauss says most of the people she 
comes in contact with who want to use a 
credit card hope to capture those ben
efits  to nab what could be 31,000 
extra frequent-flier miles for a year of 
schooling or a two-percent cash 
back on purchases. (Hey, $620 makes 
a difference.)
But allowing some people to pay by 
plastic would have deleterious effects on 
the entire student population, Strauss 
says. Because credit card companies 
charge a nominal percentage fee on ev
ery purchase, Harvard would lose a small 
portion of each students tuition paid by 
credit, thereby forcing the college to 
impose a flat fee across the entire under
graduate population to recoup the losses.
Strauss says that although many of 
the people who want to pay by credit 
card are willing to absorb the fee associ
ated with their own charges, govern
ment banking regulations prohibit the 
selective assessment of such fees.
Rather than violate the law or assess 
every student a flat fee, Harvard simply 
avoids the issues altogether  limiting 
forms of payment to cash, checks, or 
electronic wire transfers.
But for those students and parents 
who need more flexibility in paying 
Harvards admittedly large tuition bills, 
Strauss says the college offers a monthly, 
interest-free payment plan that she says 
can be considered a significantly cheaper 
stand-in for a credit card.
Among the Ivy League, at least, 
Harvards policy with regard to credit 
cards is still in the majority  only 
Columbia permits charge-able tuition.

WILMINGTON, N.C. (AP)Residents 
of eastern North Carolina evacuated beach 
towns for the third time in two months as 
Hurricane Irene churned up the coast 
Sunday, bring the heavy rains to a region 
still saturated by record floodwaters.
The greatest concern was rain, not 
wind, and the eastern coastal plain, in
undated by Hurricane Floyd just four 
weeks ago, was especially vulnerable to 
more flooding. A flood watch was issued 
for the eastern third of the state, with up 
to eight inches of rain predicted.
By midday, gale-force winds were 
reported at the coast in the southeast
ern corner of the state, and evacuation 
orders had been issued for several 
beach towns.
Irene was expected to come ashore 
near the South Carolina line about 10 
pm EDT, according to the National 
Weather Service. At 2 pm, it was 70 
miles southeast of Charleston, S.C., 
heading northeast at 12 mph.
A hurricane warning was posted from 
Savannah, Ga., to Cape Hatteras. A tropi
cal storm warning was in effect north of
Cape Hatteras to Virginia and south of 
Savannah to Femandina Beach, Fla.
Rain lashed the North Carolina main
land ahead of the storm, and a tornado 
was spotted by radar over Jacksonville 
late Sunday morning, the National 
Weather Service said.

NEW YORK (AP)  An obscenity 
barrier has been broken on network 
television, with the use of an epithet for 
excrement on CBSs Chicago Hope. 
Actor Mark Harmon, playingDr. Jack 
McNeil on the medical drama, appeared 
before a medical review board on Thurs
day nights show to explain why a promisingyoung baseball pitcher had to have 
his arm amputated when an infection 
set in following a series of operations.
------happens, Harmon said.
Neither a CBS spokesman nor Henry 
Bromell, executive producer of the se
ries, could remember a time when cen
sors had allowed the word to be used.
Its nothing I havent tried a couple 
of times before, except this time, I won, 
Bromell said.
Since producers felt strongly that the 
word was important for artistic truth
fulness, CBS chose to support them, 
spokesman Chris Ender said.
Clearly this is not something happen
ing on a weekly basis, he said. This is an 
isolated incident. Its not a sign or a signal 
that CBS is loosening its standards. 
CBS took special steps to respond to 
any of its more than 200 affiliates who 
may have been concerned about offend
ing viewers, he said. The network 
planned to feed the video to affiliates 
Thursday afternoon, instead of live 
Thursday night, to give the local sta
tions the option of masking the word.
A handful of stations expressed con
cern upon hearing about the expletive, 
Ender said.
Lesbian mothers find themselves caught in legal limbo
(AP)  With a mother!s love, 
Kathleen Crandell writes every 
week to two girls she cannot visit. 
Whether they get the letters, she 
doesnt know.
Crandell helped raise the girls 
before splitting with her lesbian 
partner and considers them her 
daughters. Distraught when ex
cluded from their lives, she sued 
for visitation rights  and lost. 
Under California law, she has no 
greater right to access than 
a stranger.
I dont think, unless youve lost 
a kid, you can even fathom what 
its like, Crandell says. Its 
pretty much every moment. Its a 
constant level of missing them/
Similarly wrenching cases are 
surfacing across the nation as 
more lesbian partners raise chil
dren born after artificial insemi
nation. When such couples sepa
rate, dissolving a union that no 
state recognizes as marriage, 
the partner who is not the bio
logical parent finds herself in 
legal limbo.
In California, New York, and 
Florida, state courts have ruled 
within the past 18 months that 
lesbian ex-partners are notentitied 
to visitation rights with children 
they helped nurture, regardless of 
how deep the emotional bond.
Massachusettss highest court, 
in contrast, granted visitation 
rights in June to a lesbian who 
helped raise her ex-partners son. 
The woman was a de facto par
ent, said the court, winning praise 
from gay-rights groups for as
serting that nontraditional fami
lies deserve legal respect.
The Massachusetts judges were 
venturing into a legal vacuum; 
one dissentingjustice condemned 
the ruling as an unwarranted step 
toward endorsing same-sex mar
riages.
Courts in many other states 
have sided categorically with the 
biological mother in such disputes, 
ruling that estranged lesbian part
ners have no more legal right to 
demand visitation than a long
term nanny or close family friend.
The courts arent used to look
ing at people without a biological 
relationship as being a childs par
ent, says Michael Adams, asso
ciate director of the American 
Civil Liberties Unions lesbian 
and gay rights project. We are 
forced to work within laws passed 
by legislatures that simply never 
considered these circumstances, 
and we can get some very unfor
tunate results.
Gay-rights activists dont con
tend that every ex-partners de
mand should be granted. But they 
do want courts at least to con
sider whether requested visita
tion rights might be in a childs 
best interest.
We want courts to force our 
families to play by the very same 
rules that heterosexual couples 
have been forced to play by for 
decades, says Kate Kendell, ex
ecutive director of the National 
Center for Lesbian Rights in San 
Francisco. We dont want any
thing special or different.
In Crandells case, the Califor
nia Supreme Court in July let 
stand an appeals court ruling 
against her. The lower court said 
no legal grounds exist for grant
ing visitation rights to a 
nonparent over the biological 
mothers objection.
Its the height of irony, given 
that California has perhaps more 
lesbian couples raising children 
than any other state, Kendell says.
Were not talking about live-in 
girlfriends. Were not talking 
about a nanny. We all know a 
parent when We see one  some
one who read a child stories at 
night, who changed their diapers, 
who was there day in, day out, 
nurturing and caring.
Crandell, now 43, and her part
ner started living together in 1985 
when the partners daughter was 
almost 3. Two years later, the part
ner gave birth to another daughter 
by artificial insemination.
The couple jointly raised the two 
girls until separating in 1990. In 
1994the ex-partner demanded that 
Crandell cease her periodic visits.
The court ruling means Crandell 
cannot see the children until they 
turn 18. They are now 17 and 12. - 
Crandell hasnt ruled out trying 
to take her case to the U.S. Su
preme Court, though she has mod
est hopes. Nothing has been more 
important to me than asking for 
my children in every possible way, 
she said in a telephone interview.
The next major ruling on the 
issue may come in New Jersey. 
The state Supreme Court plans 
hearings this fall on an appeals 
courts split decision 
granting a lesbian visitation 
rights to her former partners 
twin toddlers.
The twins, a boy and girl, were 
born two years after the women 
began living together, and the 
plaintiff shared child-rearing 
duties with the biological mother. 
Each took turns changing dia
pers, picking up the twins from 
day care, rocking them to sleep.
To date, virtually every highprofile court case regarding chil
dren of same-sex partners has
involved lesbians, not gay men. 
That could change, however, as 
liberalized adoption policies ex
pand the ranks of gay fathers.
Althoughmany gay-rights groups 
have intervened in the court cases 
to espouse the validity of same-sex 
partnerships, they wouldpreferthat 
couples avoid litigation.
This summer, an alliance of 
groups published guidelines for 
same-sex couples, urging those 
who want children to agree in 
advance on how to solve problems 
that might arise if they separate. 
Options vary from state to state, 
but it is often possible for a part
ner to become a legal parent 
through guardianship or adoption.
There are ways to resolve these 
things outside of court, says 
Mary Bonauto, a Boston lawyer 
who drafted the guidelines. 
We have a legal system that for 
the most part does not acknowl
edge the legal existence 
of our families. So its 
important that we honor our 
own agreements.

50 YEARS AGO, October 18, 
1949  A member of Carnegie 
Techs Student Council resigned, 
leaving a letter of resignation de
scribing the flaws he saw in the 
governing body. His letter opened 
by declaring that Student Coun
cil does nothing to justify its ex
istence, and that the Student 
Council was merely a clerical 
staff, sounding board, and clear
ing house for the dean. Addi
tionally, the chairman of the elec
tions committee moved that the 
Council accept the long-contested 
Hare system of counting votes.
25 YEARS AGO, October 22, 
1974  Former Carnegie Mell
on University president Rich
ard Cyert disbanded his Stu
dent Advisory Committee which 
consited of approximately 20 
students who were presidents
of influential student organiza
tions on campus. In its place Dr. 
Cyert scheduled a series of 
monthly luncheons with differ
ent groups of students. Accord
ing to Cyert, it was necessary to 
speak with a broader spectrum 
of students, as the Student Ad
visory Committee was both too 
time-consuming and did not rep
resent a large enough diversity 
of students.
10 YEARS AGO, October 17, 
1989  An unknown individual 
splashed white paint on the 
Fence, which had been painted 
by members of Carnegie Mellons 
Gay and Lesbian Alliance (GALA) 
to announce National Coming 
Out Day. Additionally, approxi
mately one third of the copies of 
the prior weeks Student Union, 
which featured several pieces re
lated to National Coming Out 
Day, were stolen. Several posters 
advertising GALAs recent dance 
were torn down.
FIVE YEARS AGO, October 
24, 1994  Student Body 
President Declan McCullagh 
organized a presidental 
committee on dining. The 
committee was to consist of rep
resentatives from Student 
Senate, Faculty Senate, GSO, 
SDC, Staff Council, and Greek 
Council. The purpose of this com
mittee was to give Dining Ser
vices input on how the Univer
sity as a whole felt about 
food on campus. The recent 
closing of Skibo and the 
problems with the Morewood 
Gardens dining facilities 
prompted the creation of 
this committee.
ONE YEAR AGO, October 19, 
1998  Members of the Pitts
burgh community gathered on the 
Cut to honor the late Matthew 
Shepard, who was murdered in 
Laramie, Wyoming. Shepard was 
a 21-year-old University of Wyo
ming student who was beaten to 
death because of his sexual pref
erences. Although no one present 
knew Shepard personally, Carn
egie Mellon University members 
rallied together to mourn this 
death, and to highlight the fact 
that this was not an isolated inci
dent. More than 200 participants 
lit candles and took part in the 
vigil, which lasted from 8 pm un
til midnight, and culminated in a 
painting of the Fence.

Dean Steams moves on to provost position
TEARNS, from page 1
roaches, and an active interest in 
the educational process and the 
experience that 'graduate and un
dergraduate students have.
George Mason is a state univer
sity, newer than Carnegie Mellon 
with many commuter students 
and a large number of masters 
programs. Its arts and sciences 
department is larger than H&SS. 
Since it is not as technical, Steams 
said it is a more conventional setup 
n comparison to CMU.
In retrospect, Steams said he 
feels that the student body at Car
negie Mellon has changed measur
ably over the past 25 years. It is 
jnuch more broadly recruited 
across the nation and internation
ally. CMU is much less a regional 
university than it was, and the onpaper ability of the students has 
zone up. The ethnic composition of 
the student body has changed. And 
the socio-economic background of 
the student body has changed to
ward a more affluent background 
than it was 25 years ago.
Stearns also said that he en
joyed being part of a process 
which enriched the educational 
experience and options of under
graduate education. I think [the 
H&SS] college is a much stron
ger educational unit than it was 
a decade or so ago.
Some of his colleagues, includ
ing Indira Nair, vice provost for 
education, commented on his sen
timents. I feel a big sense of loss. 
Peter is a valued colleague and a 
scholar and has been a great dean. 
It will be a hard task to replace 
him with someone of his states
manship, vision, and talents. 
Stearns said it is hard for him 
to leave CMU. I have lots of 
friends on the faculty and staff. 
he said. Without being corny,

it will certainly take a while. I 
have enjoyed the student contact 
greatly, I have sort of a Mr. Chips

that right away.

no student research program at

Crime and Incident Report
10/2 OPEN CONTAINER 
VIOLATION, 2:16 amCam
pus Police encountered a male 
CMU student on the steps to 
one of the fraternities on the 
quad, holding an open can of 
beer. The student was deter
mined to be 21 years of age, and 
was issued a CMU citation for 
the open container violation.
After the student was told he 
was free to leave, he continued to 
question Campus Police concern
ing the citation, asking if they 
were kidding him, would he 
graduate on time, and if he could 
have the can ofbeer he was drink
ing from back. After four series 
of the same questions, he agreed 
to go to another of the houses on 
the quad, where several of the 
brothers assured Campus Police 
that they knew him and would 
care for him for the night.
10/2 INFORMATIONAL,
8:08 am  A member of CMUs 
staff reported to Campus Po
lice that she was afraid for her 
life because of a domestic situ
ation with her ex-boyfriend. The 
day prior, he had kidnapped 
her and held her in a house for 
several hours, and she filed a 
police report with the local po
lice department. He is wanted 
on warrants for attempted ho
micide, kidnapping, criminal 
conspiracy, and violation of the 
uniform firearms act.
10/2 VANDALISM, 11:13 pm 
A CMU staff member reported 
that his car had been vandalized. 
A Campus Police officer accom
panied the staff member to the 
University Center garage, where 
the car in question was found to 
have chocolate chip ice cream on 
the rear windshield. A five-gallon tub of said ice cream was 
found a few yards away, and it 
did not appear that any other 
vehicles were involved.
10/3 ASSIST OUTSIDE 
AGENCY, 6:00 pm  A Campus 
Police officer responded to an 
apartment building on Fifth Av
enue, where he was met by a City 
police officer, to speak with a CMU 
student.
The student stated that her 
bathroom and the bathroom of 
the apartment next door used to 
be one room, but were now sepa
rated into two separate rooms by 
a partition, but because of the 
radiator on one wall, the parti
tion did not extend all the way to 
the wall. After taking a shower in 
her bathroom, she heard the toi
let flush in the other bathroom, 
so she knew someone was there. 
She went to retrieve a bottle of 
lotion from the shelf near the 
opening in the partition, and 
when she looked down, she saw a 
round shaving mirror in that 
opening. She yelled, What are 
you doing? and the mirror was
slowly withdrawn. A piece of card
board was placed over the open
ing, and the student was told to 
contact her landlord.
The officers knocked on the door 
of the other apartment, but re
ceived no answer. The officers 
told the student that they knew 
how she felt, but there was noth
ing they could do at this time. 
The student was asked if she 
needed to talk with a CMU coun
selor, and declined the offer.
10/7 DEMONSTRATION,
11:15 amCampus Police found 
flyers for a demonstration pro
testing military aid to Indonesia. 
The protest was monitored.
 Campus Chief of Police James 
Lapaglia reviews all reports prior 
to release.
 Only three people on The 
Tartan staff see the reports: the 
Editor-in-Chief the News Edi
tor, and the staffwriter typing 
the report.

WELCOME FRESHMEN!
Attorney General visits CMU
feUNS, from page 1
discussion. He is credited with 
helping develop the program.
! The ATF in recent years has 
become very proficient at gun 
bracing, he said. Its become inBlumstein added that law en
forcement must emphasize its 
effort on the relatively new guns 
and the high-caliber semi-automatic weapons that have replaced 
revolvers in recent years.
'Sk/yWhN; TIknkoyjSvEMynNyi ;gNg 'okNgn Janet Reno applauded Pittsburghs efforts in combating gun violence. 
Harry Litman, to her left, moderated the panel discussion last Tuesday.
creasingly clear that its not stoBlumstein also mentioned methlen guns but sold guns,, whether ods such as stop-and-frisk to be 
its through a straw purchaser or used in order to deter others from 
through an [illicit] dealer. carrying guns.
Operation TARGET will also 
attempt to increase awareness at 
the community level. The ATF 
will put a full-time officer in 
schools to educate young people 
about gun violence.
We want to use the networks 
among the kids.... If we get the 
word to some of them, that word 
is going to spread, said 
Blumstein. Reno applauded the 
communitys Efforts to involve 
young people in the process of 
dealing with gun violence.
Murphy is calling for specific 
legislation as part of the ongoing 
initiative against gun violence. 
These include a one handgun per 
month purchase limit, manda
tory trigger locks on any firearm 
in the city, mandatory four-hour 
training courses for anyone pur
chasing a gun, more thorough 
background checks, and closing 
loopholes of gun sales at gun 
shows and flea markets.
Litman asked for some type of 
measure in the coming years to 
ascertain whether the program 
will work.
What were hoping to do is to 
see a dramatic reduction in the 
firearms related violence thats 
on the street right now. We want 
to stop the flow of firearms from 
illegal purchases to these crimi
nals, said ATF resident agent in 
charge Brandt Schenken in re
sponse to Litmans question.
In terms of the Universitys role 
in the program, Blumstein said 
at this point time no specific one 
is defined. I think theyre going 
to want evaluation ... and were 
prepared to consider doing it. 
Blumstein said that students 
could get involved in the commu
nity through such things as BigBrother activities, and the 
University could facilitate that. 
But for a university like CMU 
theres an impressive amount of 
activity going on in working 
with schools, and in working 
with kids.
Bookstore moves online
BOOKSTORE, from page 1
ever, remember that this will 
be a phased in approach and 
services will be added con
stantly once the site is 
up and online, said David 
Post, the University Center 
store manager.
Eventually, it should include 
the ability to check the avail
ability of desired books and also 
purchase and sell them online.
It is hoped that these changes 
will make shopping at the book
store a more favorable and ap
pealing choice to students.
Beth Powell, an undeclared 
sophomore in H&SS, said, The 
bookstore here is convenient, 
but it has many negative char
acteristics. These include not 
always having books in stock, 
being overpriced, and not buy
ing books back at a fair price.... 
I think that the bookstore of
fering online services would be 
a good start to solving these 
problems. In general, the book
store should offer more ser
vices that would make it more
convenient and the better option 
for students.
This seems to be the aim of 
this growing project. It would 
serve the bookstore well to let 
students know if a book was on 
the shelf before they made the 
trip in to purchase it, said Post. 
Also, he said that if one could 
previously place an order on a 
book, it could be waiting at the 
store for immediate checkout. 
These services would save stu-. 
dents time and hassle.
I think that the bookstore is 
going to suffer if it does not do 
something to increase its popu
larity. It has been faced with a lot 
of competition from online sources 
where students can get the books 
cheaper at times and also not 
have to worry about the book be
ing in stock, said Powell.
Many students have begun us
ing other online sites or book auc
tions to buy their books. Sopho
more electrical and computer 
engineering major David Dolan 
is one of these students. In refer
ence to purchasing books from
other Web sites, Dolan said, I 
found that it was much easier to 
find the book and it was a lot 
cheaper.... I think that if the 
CMU bookstore were to start an 
online service, it wouldnt be quite 
as good because it would prob
ably be the same prices, just 
online instead of in the store. 
When questioned about the ef
fect of these new Web-based ser
vices on the campus bookstores 
sales, Post said, Competition is 
always good and can only lead to 
the best possible service for the 
students at Carnegie Mellon. 
The University Shoppe began 
modernizing its operations over 
four years ago. After moving into 
the University Center, they be
gan upgrading the cash registers 
and ordering systems. The Uni
versity Shoppe now uses the lat
est IBM POS cash registers and 
uses integrated merchandise 
management systems to place 
orders and track stock. The move 
to e-commerce is the next logical 
step in this series of improve
ments, said Post.Students reflect on Pakistan
PAKISTAN, from page 1
economics, whose father was in 
the military in Pakistan. I 
understand the sentiments of 
General Musharraf and other 
top Army officials, he said. 
The Prime Minister cannot 
dismiss an Army chief just on a 
whim. That is not democracy. 
Raza has more faith in the 
army than the politicians. The 
Armys organizational skills, 
sense of discipline, and the abil
ity to the things done are far 
superior than any other orga
nization. He said that life is
proceeding as usual and that 
people are happy that someone 
has caught the reins of Pakistan. 
Raza said he believes that India 
and Pakistan are sensible enough 
to know they cannot afford more 
wars with each other. He hopes 
that Musharraf and Prime Min
ister Vajpayee of India will agree 
to reduce tension in the region.
Raza, when asked if the coup 
was good or not for the country, 
said he believes it was a very good 
thing. It is time for new leader
ship and someone who can actu
ally do things. The west is leading
a campaign to restore democracy5 
in Pakistan, the politicians are 
crying elections in hopes to end 
up back in power, but what Paki
stan needs the most at this time is 
accountability, he said.
What the western leaders 
dont understand is that to the 
common man whats most im
portant is how expensive his 
daily consumption is. Sharif ... 
has had two opportunities to 
show [he] mean[s] business. 
Raza said the military has re
sponded to the people and is try
ing to set things straight.

FORUM
Carnegie Mellon University18 October 1999
After 25 years at Carnegie Mell
on, Peter Stearns, dean of H&SS, 
announced that he is resigning on 
January 1 to become provost of 
George Mason University in Vir
ginia. As he prepares to leave, he 
should be commended for his 
legacy of commitment to CMU, to 
H&SS, and to students.
Since becoming dean in 1992, 
Stearns has worked to expand 
H&SS course offerings and enrich 
students academic experiences. 
Two years ago, he instituted H&SS 
freshman seminars, which give 
students who are just beginning 
their CMU careers the chance to 
experience small, discussion-oriented classes taught by top faculty 
members. Other changes Stearns 
contributed to include the creation 
of a major in Japanese and a drive 
to offer more humanities courses 
that deal with non-Western civili
zations. He has always been aware 
of the need to raise H&SSs repu
tation and broaden its course of
ferings, especially in purehumanities-oriented areas. As a leading 
social historian, he has been espe
cially sensitive to the importance 
of humanities.
Stearns also deserves praise for 
his focus on teaching. His admin
istrative responsibilities notwith
standing, he has regularly found 
the time to teach two classesthe 
world history survey course that is 
required for all H&SS students, 
and a small, specialized course forLectures suffer from 
publicity problems
Many exciting speakers come to 
Carnegie Mellon to talk about their 
field of expertise. The problem is 
that people do not seem to know 
about these lectures in time to at
tend, or they do not know at all. 
Much time and energy are spent 
scheduling these speakers and finding places for them to speak, only to 
have small numbers of people show 
up. Worse, people who would have 
wanted to go to a particular lecture 
dont hear about it until its too late 
due to poor publicity. Academic and 
administrative departments.sponsoring lectures should take a 
greaterinitiative to make sure word 
of them gets.out.
Last week alone, several speak
ers visited CMU, including U.S. 
Attorney General Janet Reno and 
Pittsburgh Mayor Tom Murphy, in 
a panel on gun control, and Ma
hatma Gandhis grandson, Arun, 
for the International Festival. Un
fortunately, many students were 
entirely unaware of their presence. 
The Pittsburgh Mayors Office, 
which sponsored the panel, wasnt 
sure until the day before whether 
the event would be open to the 
public and thus didnt announce it 
until then. Nevertheless, someone 
as important as the Attorney Gen
eral coming to CMU should war
rant a last-minute run of posters. 
The Open Mind Monday lecture 
series and the Presidential lecture 
series are also examples of good 
initiatives that suffer from a simi
lar shortage of awareness.
This lack of publicity is undesir
able for many reasons, with poor 
attendance being the most obvi
ous. Not sufficiently getting the 
word out about a lecture sends a

CMU will miss wellknown dean
social history majors  as well as 
to pursue groundbreaking re
search in social history. Stearnss 
sense of humor and ability to bring 
material to life made his classes 
memorable for many students. His 
teaching of the world history course 
has helped to make him a familiar 
face not just to H&SS students but 
to the campus as a whole, since so 
many students take it during their 
first year. His dedication to serv
ing as a professor as well as a dean 
has demonstrated his focus on 
maintaining connections with stu
dents and on the spread of knowl
edge. Since Stearns has such a 
visible role on campus, this con
centration is valuable not only in 
its own right but also as an ex
ample to other faculty members.
Stearns also has involved him
self in the life of the campus com
munity as a whole. He has lent his 
active support to many studentorganized events. For instance, he 
moderated last years Student 
Body President debate and agreed 
to be kidnapped for an Amnesty 
International awareness program 
in 1998. Here, too, his actions have 
made him a role model for other 
professors and administrators.
Dean Stearns has left a legacy of 
dedication to CMU and to the stu
dent body. May he have the best of 
luck in his new position at George 
Mason. CMU would do well to 
keep his achievements in mind 
while choosing a successor.

Wireless project 
provokes letters
Letter to 
the Editor
Editor:
In the October 4 edi
tion of The Tartan you 
ran a column titled 
Writer finds wireless 
ethernet disconnected 
from need. The column, written by staff 
writer Guido Zarrella, claimed that our 
Wireless Andrew project is a magnifi
cent waste of money. I must point out 
that the entire column is based on a 
misunderstanding of the facts.
The fact is that all of the equipment 
used in the wireless project was donated 
by Lucent Technologies. Very little money 
has been spent by CMU on the project.
A key to being a good reporter or colum
nist is getting the facts right. We in Com
puting Services have often invited The 
Tartans editors and reporters to contact 
us to verify facts. The offer is still open.

bad message to the lecturer when 
the auditorium is barely half full. 
This situation gives the speaker 
the idea that Carnegie Mellon does 
not really care about what they 
have to say, which is insulting and 
wastes the time the speaker spent 
preparing for the lecture.
Often the lectures that students 
have heard about are the ones that 
pertain to their major. CIT stu
dents are made aware of robotics 
events, English students hear about 
poetry readings, and art students 
learn of art shows. However, not all 
students are interested solely in 
their areas of study. Students of all 
majors should be told about every 
lecture in some way.
Departments shouldmakeamore 
explicit attempt to publicize events. 
The Activities Board often has a 
strong publicity blitz before its lec
tures, such as those by Douglas 
Adams and Michael Moore last 
year. AB did a good job of letting 
students know when and where 
they would be speaking, putting up 
flyers well in advance of the lecture 
dates. This kind of publicity should 
be used for all guest speakers.
Perhaps an announcement sys
tem could also be established us
ing a mechanism similar to the 
Message of the Day that notifies 
Andrew Message System users of 
problems such as disabled print
ers. Word of mouth is also one of 
the best methods to spread infor
mation, so asking professors to 
mention upcoming lectures in their 
departments to their classes would 
also help get the word out about 
them. This way the students could 
take full advantage of the lectures 
that our University provides.

I would like to point 
out a fault with the 
thinking behind the

connected from need [Oct. 4]. Whenever 
you criticize any technological endeavor 
undertaken by a single individual or a 
group as significant as this University, 
you must consider the projects context. 
The need for wireless ethernet may elude 
the author of the article now, but this 
hardly validates his argument.
Few technological developments exist 
anymore without far-reaching effects. As 
the demarcation between sciences blurs, 
advancements are measured in ever-decreasingincrements. This means human
ity is benefitting from the smallest ad
vancements because, though born within 
one discipline, technology has become 
synergistic in ways previously unimag
inable, thus allowing such advancements 
to be implemented rapidly in other areas. 
An example would be the space program 
of the late 1960s. Advancements in aero
space flight eventually affected the medi
cal, ceramics, and chemical industries.
Our wireless project, though not as 
extreme as the aerospace example, will 
also impact other disciplines, and, quite 
possibly, change the way we interact with 
our computers and each other. Commu
nication is changing more rapidly than 
any other technology today, and technol
ogy as a whole is advancing at an expo
nential rate. To say the wireless project is 
a waste of money and disconnected from 
our needs is to say that such an endeavor 
need not be attempted or pursued. If we 
apply this critical view to one such en
deavor, then why not apply it to all pur
suit of knowledge and technology?
In 1882, a man working out of his small 
factory in New Jersey began implement
ing an endeavor much like our wireless 
project in some ways. His project would 
provide a service to people. Though the 
service was already in use, the compo
nents already invented, his new means of 
distribution was innovative and now cost 
effective. Critics called his project a waste 
of time and money. They continued to 
laugh and dismiss the projects need, 
even when Thomas Edison illuminated 
one square block of Manhattan Island 
with light bulbs electrified from his Pearl 
Street Central Power Station. I dont 
think there is any argument today that it 
turned out to be a worthwhile project. 
Many Congressmen also used the term 
magnificent waste of money to describe 
Sewards purchase of Alaska.
My point is, dont dismiss the value of 
an effort without understanding the 
scope of its potential impact.

Editor:
I am writing in re
sponse to Yishan 
Wongs September 27 
column [Atheist and 
theist alike should em
brace concept of God]. Does God exist? 
is the wrong question. Aibetter one is. 
What kind of God exists? Answers range 
from some absolute principle (atheism) 
to everything (pantheism) to a distant 
old man in the sky who set the world in 
motion (deism), to an omnipotent but 
loving God who not only created the world, 
but gets involved in it (theism).
Many people have a hard time believing 
that God is good, because they see so much 
evil. They expect God to icreate a world 
more to their liking. But why should even 
a good God make things the way you want 
them? Shouldnt the creator know better 
than we creatures what is really good?
Undeniably, evil exists, but not be
cause the world wasnt created good  
because humans have rebelled. Why did 
God design the world such that we could 
screw it up? Because God is so good he 
decided to create people capable of loving 
him by choice. When we choose not to love 
God, bad things happen.
The good news is that God is so good 
that even after we choose not to love him, 
he keeps loving us, calling us back to him. 
That call is why it really does matter 
what kind of God exists. Sure, there isnt 
much difference between a far-off, 
uninvolved God and none at all. But what 
if God really cares about you,, personally, 
and is offering you the chance to love and 
be loved by him forever? That prospect 
has changed millions of lives.

Mayor denies citys cultural heritage
r~fY\sCU>,
Christopher May
Saturday, October 2, a con
troversial art exhibit entitled 
Sensation opened at The 
Brooklyn Museum of Art in 
New York City. New York 
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, in a 
blatantly unfair and wrong
headed action, has cut $7.2 
million that the city uses to 
fund the museum since he 
finds the exhibit offensive. 
This is primarily due to a 
painting entitled The Holy 
Virgin Mary, which features 
a black female figure with a 
clump of elephant dung 
smeared on by artist 
Chris Ofili.
The Brooklyn Museum of 
Art is the second largest mu
seum in New York City and 
receives a third of its funding 
from the city. In response to 
the funding cut, the Museum
said that the mayor does not 
have the power to withhold 
funds the city council already 
approved. The museum has 
existed since 1823 with little 
controversy, but a series of 
lawsuits stemming from this 
exhibit have threatened its 
very existence. Besides cut
ting the funding, the mayor 
has also filed suit to evict the 
museum, since it charged ad
mission to the exhibit. The 
mayor said that the lease with 
the city requires that all fees 
be approved by him.
Here we see the mayor ac
tively attempting to evict an 
important museum from New 
York City on the basis of one 
exhibit. This is a fairly large 
logical leap for him to make. 
Do New Yorkers.want to lose 
a 175-year-old museum?
A New York Daily Post poll 
answers with a no. In fact, 60 
percent of New Y ork City resi
dents polled do not approve 
of the mayor even cutting the 
funding, never mind eviction. 
If the mayor is, by all indica
tions, acting against the will and 
well-being of the city, then why 
is he making these decisions?
The answer seemed to come in 
an interview with Fox News 
Sunday, in which Giuliani said, 
Maybe Ill sue them personally. 
Im entitled to my personal 
views. Here, we see the mayor 
expressing the fact that his per
sonal view is very strong on the 
issue. If he is willing to threaten 
a lawsuit against the museum, 
we are justified in assuming that 
his personal views could be 
clouding his judgment. As a 
Catholic, the mayor perhaps 
feels that the exhibit is an af
front to him. If this is so, then 
the mayor should certainly not 
be allowed to let his personal 
views shape his policy this in
tensely. He may be entitled to 
his personal views, but he 
should express them in a per
sonal manner, not through 
public policy.
In fact, an assortment of writ
ers and other entertainers, in
cluding Arthur Miller, Norman 
Mailer, E.L. Doctorow, Joyce
Carol Oates, and Kurt 
Vonnegut, took out a full 
page advertisement in the 
New York Times, taking a 
stance against Giulianis 
move. The ad stated, Gov
ernment should not be al
lowed to make its support of 
the arts subject to the per
sonal aesthetic or religious 
views of public officials.
Finally, Ofili said that 
The people who are attack
ing this painting are attack
ing their own interpretation, 
not mine, indicating that 
he did not mean the work in 
question as an attack. Of 
course, it can be interpreted 
that way. Even so, it is sim
ply ludicrous to evict a mu
seum from the city of New 
York based on a debatably 
accurate interpretation of a 
single painting or exhibit.

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon University  18 October 1999TIncome tax robs Americans of wages, dignity
Frank J. Fleming
One day, two years from now, 
Ill be out of college and earning 
good money with my mad engi
neering skills. Which is why 
taxes are becoming more of a 
concern to me. I plan to be in one 
of the upper-income brackets, and 
I want to keep as much money 
as I can to spend on mean selfish 
things like gas-guzzling cars 
and handguns  which, I remind 
you, is my God-given right. So 
now, when the Republicans 
want to pass a big tax cut, I think 
thats cool.
And the Democrats are saying, 
as they say with every Republi
can proposed tax cut, Its just 
a tax cut for the rich! Sounds 
even better.
But Clinton wont sign it be
cause he says this $792-billion 
tax cut is too risky. (Risky for 
whom?) The Democrats always 
call it this without mentioning 
that its over ten years, like thats
some insignificant bit of data. I 
guess they would refer to a $l-ay ear tax cut over 792 billion years 
as a $792-billion tax cut for short.
Theres a lot of this bullshit 
involved with taxes, though, and 
its all to keep us from realizing 
what a scam taxes are in the first 
place. If someone came up to you 
and said, A bunch of us decided 
that you need to give us your 
money to spend as we see fit, 
you, like any sane person, would 
drop the mo-fo. But, for some rea
son, when government demands 
money, we consider that normal.
Taxation without representa
tion was pretty bad, but Im not 
exactly dancing with glee over 
taxation with representation. 
Fifty percent of Congress could 
suddenly decide that you should 
give them 90 percent of your stuff, 
and you have no direct recourse. 
Now what the hell is that? First 
of all, the federal government 
shouldnt even be needing so 
much money. I mean, its the fed
eral government; it should only 
be doing things a huge govern
ment should be doing like killing 
evil or annoying foreigners and 
blowing up their stuff.
In the good old days, heres what 
would happen if you went up to 
the federal government and 
whined, Im hungry. I dont have 
a job. Im sick. People are dis
criminating against me.
The federal government would 
then reply, Is Canada invadin?
Uh ... no.
Then I guess Im doin my job.
But now, instead of the federal 
government just dealing with 
whether the country as a whole 
was falling apart, the Fed has 
been trying to be kind and caring. 
The problem is that something 
that huge cant care about indi
vidual people. Its like we are all 
little ants and the federal gov
ernment is a huge gorilla. Its 
beneficial for the ants, the vi
cious little buggers that they are, 
to order the gorilla to smash their 
enemies, but they wouldnt want 
it to solve their individual prob
lems because the damn thing 
would crush them as it tried to 
help without even knowing what 
it was doing. It would reach down, 
saying, I got this great society 
for you! and end up accidentally 
killing a hundred of them with its 
giant paw.
Individual problems are best 
solved by individuals, not by 
Godzilla. Of course, people dont 
want to give up all those govern
ment programs, but we could 
make that happen gradually if 
we reform the tax systems so that 
it forces the government to make 
do with only what is absolutely 
needed. One thing that could be 
done is to make a tax hike require 
a super majority, or, better yet, 
unanimous consent. For tax cuts, 
all you would need is, lets say, 
three people to approve, and five 
to override a presidential veto. 
That should keep taxes minimal.
Most important, though, we 
should repeal the sixteenth 
amendment (the one allowing 
income tax). It boggles the mind 
to think that people willingly put 
this injustice on themselves at 
the beginning of this century. Its 
no business of the government to 
know how much money you make 
a year, and it sure isnt right for 
them to just single out people and 
tell them to give them a specific. 
percentage of what they make. 
The amendment got support be
cause politicians told poor people 
it was just going to be a way to
make the rich pay their fair 
share, and soon it became the 
floodgate for the government to 
fund whatever ridiculous new 
program it came up with. Im 
not saying that we shouldnt 
let poor people vote, but 
maybe we should disenfranchise 
Democrats who love this fair 
share crap. At least, next time 
someone whines to you, The 
rich arent paying their fair 
share! punch that person in the 
face and yell, Go cry to your 
mommy, commie!
Though I am arguing that the 
federal government should save 
money by not being involved with 
the individual man, that 
shouldnt be construed as me be
ing against charity. Its like the 
difference between giving a dol
lar to a homeless man on the 
street or that same man putting 
a gun to your head and taking 
your wallet. Ones charity, the 
other is taxation.

knew how the Senate would vote and 
may have even recorded the ad before 
they voted.
The ad, which will air in Iowa and 
New Hampshire, as well as on CNN, 
features Gore sitting in front of the 
camera talking. There is no back
ground music or visual stimulus. Ev
ery so often, the camera cuts away to 
newspaper images or shots of nuclear 
weapons. For someone whose cam
paign is supposed to be focused on 
communicating with the average 
person, Gore fails miserably. The 
lack of any visual information other 
than Gore forces the viewer to look 
right at him. He wears a conservative 
suit and tie and delivers his message

Gores campaign is in serious trouble. Polls 
say that over 40 percent of Americans would 
not vote for Gore under any circumstances, 
while Republican front runner George W. 
Bushs popularity is overwhelming. Gore is 
facing a very serious challenge for the Demo
cratic nomination from former senator Bill 
Bradley. Hes also having trouble raising 
cash, even with Clintons help; many big 
donors think he cant win. Bradley even 
managed to slightly out-fundraise Gore in 
recent months.
It is no surprise that the American people 
are rejecting Gore: He comes across as dry 
and boring. He doesnt appear to have an 
original idea in his head. His speeches al

tests on nuclear weapons. In reality, the 
vote was no surprise, especially for some

informal speeches. Steve Forbes and Eliza

If Gore fails to win the Democratic nomi
nation, it will be one of the biggest politi
cal embarrassments of the century. For 
the vice president of a strong president, to 
fail to win the nomination of his. party is 
unprecedented. Personally, though, I

For years, the American drug 
policy has been this: If you use it 
and youre caught, you will be 
punished. In 47 states, that policy 
has resulted in overcrowding of 
prisons. Sixty percent of the 
prison population in Texas con
stitutes drug offenders, and a 
staggering statistic entails that 
40 percent of African-Americans 
are under scrutiny of the law, in 
prison, on parole, or under in
vestigation, mostly for drug of
fenses. Despite these attempts 
to regulate drug abuse with pun
ishment, the fact remains that 
80 million Americans have used 
marijuana alone. And that esti
mate doesnt include the count
less other drugs on the street. So 
why are we still trying to use 
punishment as a means to. con
trol drug use?
Recently, one popular and wellrespected Republican governor, 
Gary Johnson of New Mexico, 
stepped forward with a new vi
sion for American drug policy. 
Johnson told activists and schol
ars at the Cato Institute, a liber
tarian think tank, that the gov
ernment should regulate narcot
ics, not punish those who abuse 
them. Johnson, who 
admits to using 
marijuana and co
caine in his college 
years, said, For the 
amount of money 
were putting into 
the war on drugs, I 
suggest its an ab
solute failure. Make 
drugs a controlled 
substance like alco
hol.... Legalize it, 
control it, regulate 
it, and tax it. If you 
legalize it, we might 
actually have a 
healthier society.
Johnson sees the 
war on drugs in a 
traditionally eco
nomic Republican 
way. He understands that money 
is power and that when a sub
stance becomes a commodity, it 
can be controlled. While the 
governors .proposal is radical,
putting drugs under government 
control has a lot of merit. For one, 
users could be assured of the qual
ity of the drug they are buying. 
Drugs, like all ingestible sub
stances, would be regulated by
Joe Hocking/Tartan Art Staff 
FDA-style safety laws, which will 
make for a safer product than 
what is out on the street. This 
policy would also allow for taxa
tion of drugs, which would conThe bottom line is that the traditribute to the amount of money 
the government could spend on 
its drug regulation program. Plus, 
the flow of drugs would be in the 
hands of government officials, not 
drug traffickers. Furthermore, 
like alcohol, drugs 
would be prohibited 
to people under 21. 
The proposal includes 
a provision that 
would allow employ
ers to issue drug tests 
and fire employees 
caught using narcot
ics on the job.
Those who oppose 
Johnsons policy, such 
as President Clintons 
drug chief Barry 
McCafferty, claim 
that this plan would 
put more drugs 
into the hands of chil
dren and make drugs 
more available on 
Americas streets. 
However, the esti
mated 80 million American mari
juana users are evidence that the 
illegal nature of drugs doesnt 
make them any harder to obtain.
tional American drug policies 
have not hindered use; rather, 
they crowd prisons and substan
tially contribute to the amount of 
gun violence in America. These 
policies are not working, so why 
not try something else? Why not 
stop spending money on punish
ing drug users and start spend
ing that money on education and 
drug treatment and rehabilita
tion programs?
While I agree with the main 
notions proposed in Gov. 
Johnsons plan, the extent of his 
suggested policy is drastic. It may 
be unrealistic to expect that the 
American public as well as gov
ernment officials would be will
ing to agree to a policy that in
cludes the legalization of all 
drugs. But the slow progress to
ward legalization of marijuana 
for medical use is proof that 
Americas attitude towards drug 
use is shifting and will perhaps 
open up to a policy like Gov. 
Johnsons in the future.

I Column As I See 'em
by Colt Foutz
Okay, so I miss John Elway.
No, I dont miss him scram
bling around in the Broncos 
backfield, sacrificing his body 
while taking on drooling defen
sive linemen, making the seem
ingly impossible play as the sec
onds tick away in the fourth quar
ter. I mean, weve got Brett Favre 
to provide that drama in the 
league now that Elway has re
tired, and the Packers have never 
had to go through the Cleveland 
Browns to get to the Super Bowl. 
Thats right. Im a Browns fan. 
Elway will remain forever etched 
in my memory, hopping around 
in triumph with the Mile High 
Stadium lights glinting off his 
grinning beaver teeth, beating 
the Browns three times in the 
AFC championship game in the 
late 80s, only to fail fantastically 
in the Super Bowl.
No, I will not miss John Elway 
the football player. What I miss 
about John Elway are his com
mercials for Coors beer.
You know the ones Im talking 
about, right? They started airing 
at the end of the preseason and 
stopped inexplicably just two 
weeks into the regular season. 
The camera pans in on a glori
ously sunny day at Mile High, 
and ESPN Sports Center anchor 
Dan Patrick smiles in the fore
ground. Patrick then proceeds to 
plant his lips firmly on Elways 
scrambling butt.
Okay, so he says something 
complimentary about Elway. 
Something like: Stanford Uni
versity legend tells of a game day 
when all of the footballs the team 
used were flat and there was no 
pump to be found, so they had to 
use a medicine ball instead. In 
the fourth quarter, with the team 
trailing USC by 17,000 points, 
Stanfords quarterback threw the 
winning 19,000-point touchdown 
pass as time expired, decapitat
ing a USC cornerback in the pro
cess. That quarterback? John 
Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt 
Elway. Then we cut to old Mighty 
Molars Elway himself, lounging 
in a chair with a bucket of cold 
ones at his side. Coors in a yel
low can, Elway informs us. Now 
thats original.
If my loathing for number 7 is 
barely concealed, please try and 
understand. This guy has been so 
overrated in my mind for so long 
that I cant bear to see one of my
favorite sportscasters serve as his 
personal ego masseur. Dan 
Patrick, come on! At least he 
doesnt make Boston Market 
commercials like former 
ESPN tag team partner 
Keith Olbermann.
Hey, maybe its me. In 
the interest of fairness,
Ill admit that not all 
of the sports gods of 
recent history meet my 
criteria for adulation.
Nolan Ryan? The guy 
was old and sported a 
near-4.00 ERA. Cal 
Ripken? Saint Balti
more didnt even 
who Lou Gehrig was, 
and couldnt 
care less about 
finding out that 
he was about to 
break the con
secutive games 
record that Gehrig 
set while his bones 
were literally disinte
grating beneath his skin as 
he died from a terminal disease. And besides, Cal 
couldnt even hit .300! So 
yes, my standards are a 
bithigh. But then, I dont 
need to go to Boston Mar
ket for a homestyle 
meal, either.
Whats really funny is "Tthat the Denver Broncos 
are playing like they believe ev
erything Patrick says about 
Elway. The two-time defending 
Super Bowl champions have man
aged to win only one game thus 
far this season and, folks, the 
way theyre playing, theyre go
ing to be lucky to double that 
total. Terrell Davis, their run
ning back and last seasons NFL 
MVP, is out for the year with a 
torn anterior cruciate ligament, 
and their All-Pro tight end, Sh
annon Sharpe, may be lost as 
w.ell. Meanwhile, coach Mike 
Shanahan has managed to con
vince the majority of Denver that 
hes been hitting the Coors Origi
nal a little too hard, stating that 
Bubby Brister would succeed 
John Elway at quarterback, then 
yanking Brister for second-year 
man Brian Griese, and then cav
ing to pressure and putting 
Brister in again only to see 
Brister throw two interceptions 
and go down with an injury. Bad 
luck? Well, my theory is that its 
just another case of the Millen
nium Melodramatic Commer
cial Curse.
Dont believe me? Check out 
the latest Pepsi commercial, star
ring that cutesy Curly Sue lookalike and NASCAR driver Jeff 
Gordon. In the ad, Gordon is lead
ing a race and Curly Sue passes 
him to win at the finish, riding a 
bike, or a tricycle, or a moped or
something. I dont remember, and 200 mph to
its not important. I dont have a ? win a Pepsi,
problem with Curly Sue beating 
a racecar that goes
as fT7\C^\ V
Hey, its 
cute. 
What 
caught 
my eye is 
that the 
only other 
speaking part in 
the commercial be
longed to Gordons crew chief, 
who in an actual race would be 
overseeing all pit stops, equip
ment decisions, and track strate
gies, but in this case could only 
offer Gordon an exasperated, 
Cmon, Jeff, lets gooooooo, and, 
Didnt you see them cornin? 
Now, for most NASCAR fans, 
Jeff Gordon is to racing what John 
Elway is to the Cleveland Browns 
 very, very irritating and very, 
very good. They dont like Gordon 
because hes everything that most 
drivers arent; namely, hand
some, articulate, metropolitan, 
and in possession of all of his 
teeth. Thus, while the only 
rational, yet backhanded, 
way I can explain Elways 
success is by citing his freak
ishly large front teeth, 
^ NASCAR fans can point to
- ^ Gordons real-life crew chief, Ray
Evernham, as the reason that 
*" ' * -  , -  Gordon has 47 race victories
and three Winston Cup 
James Mojonnier/Tartan Art Editor championships, instead of
Happy Helpers Wanted.

just admitting that Gordon may 
be a really good driver, and not 
just some citified punk sent 
out to ruin the great sport of 
auto racing.
Well, ignoringthat controversy 
for the moment, fans of auto rac
ing may have to find another way 
to explain Gordons success since 
Evernham stepped down as crew 
chief of Hendrick Motorsports two 
weeks ago. Since then, Gordon 
has taken instructions from Brian 
Whitesell and won both of the 
races hes started. So, if youre 
scoring at home, or even if youre 
alone (to borrow a phrase from 
Dan Patrick), the Millennium 
Melodramatic Commercial Curse 
has stuck again. No crew chief? 
No problem. And you racing fans 
thought that Curly Sue was just 
a really good driver!
As far as I can tell, the commer
cial curse is here to stay. Gone 
are the days when graying former 
athletes can sit at a bar and ar
gue about whose career was bet
ter. Okay, so Dan Fouts and Fran 
Tarkenton are doing that for 
Miller Lite. Gone are the days 
when an athlete can associate 
himself with a sandwich, candy
bar, or mustard. All right, so Mark 
McGwire has his Big Mac and 
Jerome Bettis has his own wing 
at Giant Eagle. Just trust me on 
this one, keep your eye out for 
more prophetic commercials be
fore the year flips over to 2000. 
The way things are going I have 
an eerie feeling that Dick Vermeil 
and surprise quarterback sensa
tion Kurt Warner of the St. Louis 
Rams will be arm in arm with 
Mickey Mouse and planning their 
off-season vacations before the 
Thanksgiving parade airs. Thats 
right. The Rams win the_ 
Super Bowl and they all go to 
Disney World.
Hey, stop laughing. A curse is 
nothing to sneer at, especially 
when a brand name beverage is 
involved. Just ask the Broncos 
and a thousand NASCAR fans..
Colt Foutz still admires Dan 
Patrick, even though Patrick ha 
sold his soul to Adolph Coorsf. 
And Foutz highly recommends 
Patrick's book The Big Show to 
any sports-mad reader that wants 
to delve a little deeper into the evil 
that is Cal Ripken and the genius 
that is innovative sportscasting.

FSU wideout adds drama to Heisman race
Between The Uprights
by Pete Patterson
When assessing a college football sea
son, there are two things that stick out 
in the mind of most fans. First is the 
national champion, second the Heisman 
Trophy winner. Thanks to Peter Warrick, 
the race for both of these is now wide 
open. When Florida States superb 
wideout couldnt elude surveillance 
cameras at a Dillards department store 
as easily as opposing defenders, he 
made both of these races much more 
interesting.
We are already two-thirds of the way 
through the season, yet the national 
championship picture is still very 
cloudy. Michigan State fell from the 
ranks of the unbeatens this weekend, 
but there are still several legitimate 
contenders left for the top spot. FSU is 
still my pick to win it all, but they are 
much more vulnerable withoutWarrick 
and partner in crime Lavernaus Coles. 
QB Chris Weinke hasnt missed a beat 
without his two receivers yet, but that
could change when the Seminoles meet 
the Gators to close out the season. FSUs 
defense has been some
what shaky at times, and 
without Warrick the of
fense may not be able to 
outscore Florida in 
a shootout.
If the Noles fall,
Virginia Tech will be right 
there to take over. Thats 
right, these Hokies are for 
real, and are playing the 
best football in the 
country right now. The un
derrated squad forced the 
nation to take notice with 
a 62-0 win over number15 Syracuse last Saturday.
Everyone knew Corey 
Moore and the defense 
would be awesome, but 
freshman quarterback 
Michael Vick has provided 
Donovan-McNabb-like 
play to spark the offense.
Penn State also has kept 
marching along, knocking 
off another solid opponent 
in Ohio State last week
end. The Lions offense has 
been up and down, but Eric McCoo and 
Rashard Casey each had breakout type 
games this weekend. If the offense starts 
putting up big numbers, no one is going 
to beat this team.
Out west in the Big Twelve, Nebraska 
and Kansas State have quietly been
Joe Hocking/Tartan Art Staff
rolling up victories. Whichever team wins 
their November 13 match-up in Lincoln 
could very likely end the season unde
feated. Considering each of these teams 
along with those with one loss who could
possibly play themselves into the title 
hunt, such as Michigan, Michigan State, 
GeorgiaTech, Florida, Ten
nessee, and Alabama, one 
can see that the race is go
ing to go down to the wire.
It appears that the 
Heisman race will also re
main undecided late into 
the season. Unlike last 
years coronation of Ricky 
Williams, there are several 
legitimate candidates now 
that Warrick decided he 
needed a discount on some 
slacks and shirts. Right 
now, Id have to say the 
frontrunner is Georgia Tech 
quarterback Joe Hamilton. 
He has not slowed down 
since his huge game against 
Florida State, and he keeps 
helping the Yellow Jackets 
pull out close victories al
most single-handedly. Ala
bama running back Shaun 
Alexander is close on 
Hamiltons heels, as he 
keeps having huge games 
for the Crimson Tide. After 
gaining over 200 yards in 
Bamas huge upset against Florida two 
weeks ago, Alexander ran for 214 yards 
and three touchdowns this week against 
a Mississippi defense that was second in 
the nation against the run.
Speaking of running backs, who can 
forget Wisconsins huge Ron Dayne? A 
solid, steady runner, Dayne doesnt fit 
the flashy mold of past Heisman win
ners. No one can argue with his stats, 
though, as hes on pace to break Ricky 
Williamss yardage record. Purdues 
Drew Brees vaulted back into the race 
this week by throwing for over 500 yards 
and five touchdowns in a huge upset 
over Michigan State. Its almost a guar
antee that one of these four will win the 
award, but theres no way to be sure. 
Chris Weinke, Chris Redman, Chad 
Pennington, Kevin Feterik, or Travis 
Prentice could possibly make runs at the 
award. Also, should Virginia Tech man
age to claim the national title, I imagine 
dominant defensive end Corey Moore 
would garner some support.
So, Ive managed to narrow the cham
pionship and Heisman trophy races down 
to about 10 contestants each. A couple of 
weeks ago, I would have confidently 
named Florida State and Peter Warrick, 
respectively. While I feel bad for the 
Florida State program and Warrick per
sonally, I would like to thank him for his 
infractions, for he caused a lot of uncer
tainty in the college football world that 
is going to make the important aspects 
of the season come down to the wire.

Yankees, Braves close in on World Series
Play Ball
by Matt Brun
I dont understand it, I really dont. My 
.predictions made sense, really. My gut 
f&elings have never steered me wrong 
before, yet only one of my four picks for 
the Division Series actually won. Id 
love to give predictions for the League 
Championship Series, especially since 
there are only two, so my odds are 
pretty good, but since they started al
ready, Im left abusing the brim of my 
lucky cap, trying to figure out where I 
went wrong.
For the sake of my shredded ego, I 
think Ill start with the one match-up I 
did pick right, the Braves-Astros series. 
This one was almost a no-brainer. Hous
ton had been sleepwalking since the AllStar break even in the midst of a pen
nant race with Cincinnati, while the 
Braves strode on, biding their time until 
the best rotation in baseball started 
showing it again. Well, they did, and 
Atlanta finished the season with the 
best record in the bigs.
Having made the playoffs in every 
year of the 90s, the Braves have a vir
tual monopoly on the playoff experience 
intangible that sports writers give so 
much importance. I personally feel that 
experience and momentum are a load of 
crap once the playoffs start, and game 
one proved my point beautifully when 
Houston beat postseason hero Greg 
Maddux in Atlanta, andgasp!  stole 
all of Atlantas momentum. The sup
posed momentum shift lasted all of one 
pitch, which was about all it took for 
Kevin Millwood to show the Astros that 
game two was going to be a bit different. 
Games three and four followed suit, and
Houston was left stunned and in awe of 
the clearly superior Braves.
As for the Braves opponent in the 
NLCS, Im glad the Mets prevented an
other team from buying a World Series 
appearance with free agents  Im just 
not sure how they did it. These were the 
same Mets that won the NL wild card in 
spite of themselves and their incredible 
collapse over the last two weeks of the 
season. They dominated the onegame playoff with Cincinnati, 
though, and continued that 
into game one when they beat 
the best southpaw pitcher 
since Sandy Koufax, Randy 
Johnson.
Arizona rebounded in 
game two, however, 
and the world let out a 
sigh of relief as the 
Mets highly antici
pated collapse looked 
imminent. Naturally, 
this didnt happen, as 
the Mets showed a re
silience that hadnt 
been there all season.
After winning game 
three, the Mets were on 
the verge of closing out 
the series, and, still, no
body believed they could 
actually do it.
Lo and behold, the Mets 
continued to surprise, winning 
game four in the most dramatic of fash
ions. An extra-inning home run by the 
back-up catcher clinched the series and 
started people talking about a possible 
reincarnation of the Miracle Mets.
I guess going l-for-2 in the National 
League isnt bad, though Id rather 
have gone 0-for-2 if it meant the 
Braves losing. Over in the Ameri
can League, however, things didnt 
go at all the way I expected.
First there was the Cleveland-Boston series  at this point Ill pause for 
a couple minutes so you can finish laugh
ing at me and my beloved Indians. Dont 
deny it, I know you are. The beginning of
the end for Cleveland was the eighth 
inning of game one, when manager Mike 
Hargrove pulled pitcher Bartolo Colon 
so he could be ready to pitch a possible 
game four on three days rest. Keep in 
mind that Colon had 
never in his career 
tried to pitch on 
only three days 
rest.
hard was going to be ready to go on just 
three days rest.
Of course, after game two, it didnt 
look like the series would get that far, as 
the Indians pitchers had been decent 
and the offense was finally 
starting to hit. Even after 
the Red Sox won game 
three, there was no cause 
for panic by the shores of 
Lake Erie, but there 
should have been.

had 
to do 
was put 
anyone but 
Colon on the mound 
for game four to keep the 
game close, and if they lost, 
Colon would be ready for a 
game-five rematch with Pedro 
Martinez. Instead, an obviously 
tired Colon got shelled and had to be 
yanked early, wearing out arms in the 
bullpen that were needed for game five. 
Then, in the deciding game, without 
Colon able to go, the Indians had no one 
to counter Martinez, who was not going 
to be denied a win for a second time. 
The end result of the Indians making 
like the Mets in the regular season was 
that Hargrove, the winningest man
ager in Indians history, lost his job. 
Several years of coasting to division 
titles proved to be too little as 
Hargroves poor management of 
his pitchers finally caught up to 
him, as did the lack of playoff 
results for one of the most talented teams 
in history.
For the final Division Series match
up, Im going to cop out and give myself 
half-credit for picking the Rangers. I 
gave Texas a chance if they could stretch 
the series to five games, but deep down, 
I knew the Yankees were just too much
for the Rangers to handle. I guess I let 
my deep-seated hatred of the Yankees 
influence my prediction more than just a 
little bit, but there are enough people 
out there who share my feelings about
New York to justify it.
Naturally, the Yankees pulled off 
the only sweep of the first 
round, proving once again 
that Texas just doesnt stack 
up. On a side note, this match
up will most likely continue for 
several years as long as baseball 
maintains the rule that teams from 
the same division cant play each 
other in the first round. Since the 
Yankees, the Indians, and prob
ably also the Rangers, are all but 
guaranteed to win their respec
tive divisions, and the Red Sox 
are still the best of the rest, the 
same match-ups will happen regard
less of what order the teams finish in the 
regular season.
As for the League Championship Se
ries, theyre going perfectly according to 
form. The Yankees and Braves jumped 
out to huge leads before Boston and the 
Mets could steal a win. The big differ
ence is that the Mets were just lucky to 
avoid a sweep, while Boston actually 
has a chance to come back and win a trip 
to the World Series. Atlanta proved at 
the end of the regular season that the 
Mets cant beat them by taking five out 
of six games over the course of the last 
two weeks. Boston has shown that they 
can beat the Yankees, but, as usual, 
theyd like their chances a lot better if 
they could just have Martinez pitch 
every game.
For all the progress the Mets and Red 
Sox have made, theyre still not in the 
same class as the Yankees and Braves. 
The Braves have been the most consis
tent team in the 90s hands down, and 
the Yankees, well, theyre the Yankees. 
With the Braves about to finish off the 
Mets, and the Yankees holding the edge 
over Boston, look for a rematch of the 96 
World Series.
Matt Brun is out of the predicting 
business for good following his horrible 
first-round failures. Hes just glad that 
hockey season has started to take his 
mind off the Indians performance. Go 
Red Wings!

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon University  18 October 199913
Volleyball sweeps weekend tournament
By MATTHEW LANKEN
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
Last Saturday, the 1999 Carn
egie Mellon Womens Volleyball 
Tournament pitted the Carnegie 
Mellon team against five other 
schools in a grueling nine-hour 
competition. The UC Gym was 
filled with Tartan red and white
ally ranked team, Elmira Col
lege, coming in second place.
We played exceptionally well, 
said head coach Julie Webb. We 
have a lot of experience, we have 
very talented freshmen, and we 
have an outstanding program.
Webb also said that one of 
CMUs strengths is in the spe
cialization of players on the team.
Stacey Tetzlaff/Tartan 
CMU prepares to return a volley during Saturdays action. The team 
continue their dominating run into the UAA meet later this month.
i as well as a rainbow of other 
: school colors, as parents andplayi ers crowded the available seats, 
j As the day wore on, CMU contin
ued their winning streak and 
swept to a decisive victory, with 
the tournaments other regionWe have great passers, great 
hitters, and great centers, 
she said.
The players had more reasons 
for their victory. Our communi
cation was much improved, and 
that helped us succeed in our
overall game, said first-year stu
dent Lauren Schmidt.
Everyone played really well. 
We were connecting well, said 
senior setter Sarah Putaro.
Some players, like senior 
Stephanie Szobota, said that 
CMUs fantastic passing was a 
factor in the victory, while others 
focused more on the teams 
confident attitude.
We played at our 
level and not down at 
their level, said jun
ior Jeri Goede.
CMU started the 
day in a match against 
Bethany College. They 
won the first two 
games 15-5 and 15-6, 
then proceeded to win 
the last one 15-9 to 
win the match 3-0. Of 
particular note was 
first-year setter Amy 
Bergvall, who had 
more than 12 assists 
in the last two games 
alone, as well as an 
impressive-looking 
double block with 
sophomore hitter 
Sara Lechleitner.
The second match 
hopes to was against the Uni
versity of PittsburghJohnstown team. The Tartans 
won the first game easily with a 
score of 15-3. The next two games 
were slighty closer at 15-8 and 
157, but CMU prevailed and won 
the match 3-0. Several non-retumed serves and an overall solid
defensive effort made for a 
quick match.
In the semi-final match against 
Washington & Jefferson College, 
the Tartans started out strong, 
getting six points before the W& J 
team could even score once. After 
a short scoring streak by W&J, 
CMU came back to win 15-3. 
This pattern was repeated in the 
second match as strong serving 
by senior Ashley Kinsey and sev
eral assists by Putaro let CMU 
build their lead to 12-1 before 
W&J really started to score. The 
game ended with a score of 15-7. 
In the third game, the two teams 
started out neck and neck and 
stayed close until the last few 
points when CMU pulled ahead 
to win 15-9, giving them a 3-0 
win once again.
For the final match, CMU and 
NCAA regionally ranked Elmira 
College were paired up. Both 
teams were in top form even with 
several injuries on the Elmira 
team. Elmira fought hard, but 
couldnt stop the Tartans from 
getting a 3-0 win with three vic
tories by wide margins. The seem
ingly unending series of assists 
from Putaro made this difficult 
victory almost routine for the 
Tartans. The win made their 
record for the tournament 12-0 
and 4-0 in matches.
Three of the CMU women were 
singled out for individual honors 
for their performances in the tour
nament. Szobota was named as 
the tournaments outstanding 
player. Putaro and Schmidt
were both named all-tourna
ment players.
Sarah Putaro is a driving force 
on the team because she picks up 
everything and shes so vocal, 
said Lechleitner.
Webb said that one of the things,, 
the team is working on is taking,' 
control of the game right from tl5ei! 
start since they will need to do-, 
this to beat the tougher teams inthe Championships.
Starting with the UAA round robin 
squad has an unbelievable record
The team is looking forward to 
the UAA Championships. The 
main obstacles between them and 
the top are the two toughest teams 
in the conference, Emory and 
Washington University. Coach

By MATT BRUN
Tartan Sports Editor
Heading into the upcoming UAA cham
pionship meet, the CMU cross country 
teams are showing that placing in last 
! years NCAA championship meet was 
no fluke by finding the toughest 
i competition available to prove their tal
ents against.
The women were in Carlisle, Pennsyl
vania two Sundays ago for the Dickinson 
College Invitational, one of the largest 
regional meets. A total of 28 teams from 
all over Pennsylvania andNew Yorkran 
in the meet, and CMU was right there 
among the best of them.
All seven members of the CMU squad 
turned in outstanding performances, as 
each runner earned a score under 100 in 
a field of 178. Sophomore philosophy 
major Brooke Cutler led the Tartans 
with a fourth-place finish in a time of 
18:51. Cutler ran with the leaders for 
the entire race, falling just short in the 
final sprint. The margin of victory was a 
| slim one, as Cutler finished just two 
seconds behind the second-place finisher
from Kutztown University, and a mere 
14 seconds behind the race winner, Cara 
Devlin of Ithaca College.
The next finisher for the Tartans was 
senior computer science major Andrea 
Byrnes, who placed 13th. Byrnes ran 
squarely in the middle of a second large 
pack of runners who took the sixth 
through 25th finishing positions. 
Byrness time of 19:28 was only six sec
onds short of giving the Tartans their 
second top-10 finisher of the day.
Not far behind Byrnes was sophomore 
chemistry major Kelly Chin, whose 19:56 
time was good enough for 24th place. 
With three runners in the top 25, CMU 
joined Ithaca and Moravian College as 
the early leaders.
As more runners crossed the line, how
ever, the Tartans began to fall behind. 
Ithaca and Moravian both placed two 
runners each before CMUs next-high
est finisher, first-year student Katie 
Aemi, came in with a 52nd-place finish 
in a time of 20:34.
Moravian cemented the win when their 
final runner finished in 77th place, while 
host Dickinson and Rowan University
both slipped ahead of CMU with closely 
grouped finishes by all of their runners.
CMUs final trio of runners, first-year 
Sonni Abatta, senior English major Liz 
Currid, and senior psychology major 
Melissa Sloan, also finished as a close 
group, but were just far enough behind 
the other teams to keep CMU in fifth 
place. The group earned 96th, 99th, and 
103rd finishes, respectively, to give the 
Tartans a total of 183 points for 
the meet.
Moravian won the meet with a mere 
96 points, just ahead of Ithacas 105. 
Dickinson took third with 120, and 
Rowan beat out CMU for fourth with 
152. The other UAA schools which par
ticipated in the meet, Johns Hopkins 
University and New York University, 
finished well behind CMUs pace. Johns 
Hopkins finished 13th with 355 points, 
and NYU was not far behind with 375, 
good enough for 15th place.
With the UAAs just two weeks away, 
CMUs performance helped to reinforce 
the squads confidence in their ability to 
repeat last years performance, which 
qualified them for the NCAA meet.

squad took 
their search 
for suitable

higher ex

squads. No one bothered to inform the 
Tartans that the DI schools at the meet 
were stronger than them, though, as the 
squad powered to a fourth-place finish. 
CMU placed ahead of every other Dili 
school at the meet, as well as all of the 
DII teams, and three DI teams: Bucknell 
University, Malone College, and Penn 
State University.
The only teams CMU was unable to 
defeat were all DI programs, including
host Duquesne, Robert Morris College, 
and the University of Pittsburgh. As! 
usual, the Tartans top finishes were, 
turned in by senior mechanical engjij 
neering major Kenn Oldham, senior ECE'! 
major Bryan Meyer, and sophomore, 
mechanical engineering major.

The next meet for both squads is the

FOOTBALL, from page 14
attempt failed, but CMU was on 
the board and closed the score to 
.10-6 with plenty of football left to 
I play.
The dramatics of the day came 
in the closing minutes. The Tar
tan offense took the field at their
28-yard line. Six plays later, the 
Tartans had marched down to 
the Maroon 20-yard line and were 
knocking on the door with two 
minutes to go. The drive stalled 
there and the Tartans were faced 
with a critical fourth-and-10 from 
the 20-yard line. Down by four 
points and needing more than 
just a field goal to tie the game, 
Lackner elected to risk it all and 
i go for it.
I Zimpfer completed a pass to 
sophomore Matt Saneholtz for 12 
| yards, and the hopes for a late! game comeback were still alive.
Four plays later, CMU found 
themselves in another fourth and 
long  this time it was fourth' and-goal from the 7-yard line with 
1:17 left on the clock.
 We werent running the ball 
for anything that day and so there 
was no way we werent throwing 
it in that situation, said Lackner, 
remarking that if the extra point
would have been good on the 
teams first touchdown, the coach
ing staff would probably have 
elected to kick the field goal and 
tie the game.
The Tartans gambled again 
with the unproven arm of 
Zimpfer. Playing up to the chal
lenge, Zimpfer threw to junior 
Matt Strohl for the touchdown 
that put the Tartans ahead for 
good, 13-10 after OMalleys ex
tra point kick.
[Zimpfer] showed some ca
pable things in a tough situa
tion, said Lackner. He made 
some good decisions at critical 
times.... Overall, this game shows 
that we are a team that does not 
give up. Weve proven that were 
a never-say-die team.
The Chicago game also marked 
two important personal achieve
ments for the Tartans. With his
29-rushing-yard performance, 
Campie became CMUs all-time 
rushing leader.
Hes been a hell of a football 
player, said Lackner. Hes a 
great student ... a leader by ex
ample on the field and a very 
unselfish player all around.
It was also Lackners 100th 
career win as head coach. Lackner
is quick to praise his assistant 
coaches Rich Erdelyi and Terry 
Bodnar for the personal accom
plishment. It wasnt Rich 
Lackners 100th win. The honor 
belongs to the entire staff and 
the Carnegie Mellon foot
ball program.
By beating Chicago, the Tar
tans put themselves in prime 
position to regain the UAA crown, 
which they had held for four con
secutive years prior to last sea
son. A home loss to the Maroons 
was the deciding factor as Chi
cago broke the Tartans string 
and took the title. This years 
game was due payback for CMU.
The next major obstacle in the 
fight for the UAA crown will take 
place next week as Washington 
University of St. Louis travels to 
Pittsburgh to battle the Tartans 
in the last home game of the year. 
A win would guarantee CMU at 
least a tie for the UAA title.
WashU has excellent athletes 
on their team, said Lackner. 
Were going to have to establish 
a running game early to 
beat them.
Kickoff for Saturdays match
up is scheduled for 1:00 pm at 
Gesling Stadium.

Champions...CMU rebounds from first 
loss with last-second win
By BRIAN SMITH
Tartan Special Projects Manager
The IM flag football finals were held last Thursday night at Gesling Stadium. For 
full results, please see page 10.
The womens squad ended their
visitingTartans gave up a quick 
goal in the first 30 seconds of 
the game, and after two more 
scores, saw themselves down 
3-0 going into halftime. Dur
ing the second half, though, the 
story seemed to read quite dif
ferently. The Tartans domi
nated, outshootingthe stunned 
Emory squad 9-3, and held the 
ball in front of the opposing net 
for practically the entire half. 
The second half was probably 
the best soccer we played all 
year, said first-year forward 
Melissa McMorrow.
Although the Tartans domi
nated, they were unable to 
record a goal, and the score 
remained 3-0 until the final 
whistle. First-year goalie Maya 
Nigrosh played well in goal for 
the Tartans, stopping three second-half breakaways.
The Tartans next match was 
away on Sunday against a solid 
NYU team, in what proved to 
be a game harshly influenced 
by inclement weather condi
tions. An early NYU goal left
road trip with a 1-1-1 record.
like that, anything can hap
pen. It was a rough game, and 
we were happy to come away 
with a tie, said Celone.
A third straight road game 
took CMU to Grove City last 
Friday night. A well-played con
test by the Tartans gave them a 
21 victory, and some momen
tum which will hopefully carry 
into this coming weekends con
ference matches. The two 
goalscorers were McMorrow 
and junior midfielder Christy 
Kelly. The first goal was scored 
five minutes into the game. An 
assist was also added by Celone. 
We dominated the entire game 
and were able to control the 
ball in the center of the field, 
said sophomore midfielder 
Ashley Wermine.
This coming weekend, the 
womens soccer hosts a pair of 
conference games. On Friday 
at 8 pm, the Tartans will face 
Brandeis University, and then 
on Sunday at 1:30 pm, they will 
face a tough University of 
Rochester team.
Soccer teams unbeaten 
streak continues on road
By DONNY DEBARR
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
The mens soccer team re
mained unbeaten in their last 10 
games by coming away with one 
win and two ties in three matches 
last week.
The first match took place last 
. Friday at Emory. At the time of 
the game, Emory was ranked 
fourth in the nation and tied for 
first in the UAA with the Tar
tans. The day proved to be a good 
one, as CMU went into Emorys 
house and held them scoreless 
for 120 minutes. Unfortunately 
for the Tartans, they could not 
put in a score themselves, and 
the best they could come away 
with was a 0-0 tie. Both teams 
had the opportunities to score, 
but a few tremendous goal-line 
saves by both teams kept the 
match scoreless. By tying the 
fourth-ranked Emory squad on 
their home turf, the Tartans are 
now receiving votes for the top 25 
national rankings and have 
moved up to fourth in the re
gional rankings. We know that 
every year Emory is going to be 
one of our toughest games. Play
ing a solid game down in Atlanta 
was big, said junior midfielder 
David ZuponContinued solid 
play by the defense contributed 
to the teams eighth shutout in
their last 10 games. CMU re
ceived adequate offensive per
formances during that stretch, 
but the defense more than 
made up for it.
The Tartans road trip con
tinued on Sunday, when they 
traveled to NYU with the hopes 
of gaining a win and taking 
sole possession of first place in 
the conference. Due to some 
harsh weather and a shoddy 
field, the game would not tell 
the true tale of who the better 
team was that day. The Tar
tans outplayed their opponents 
for 120 minutes, but were just 
unable to convert, and could 
only come away with another 
0-0 tie. Despite the horrible 
conditions during the game , 
the CMU defense recorded an
other shutout, and the team 
extended their unbeaten streak 
to nine games despite not be
ing able to manage a goal of 
their own.
After some tough away 
games, the Tartans took the 
home turf on Wednesday night 
against St. Vincent College. 
CMUs trouble with the 
weather followed them back 
from New York, as 
Wednesdays game was not 
only played in some rain, but 
was actually delayed by an hour 
and a half due to severe lightning

last 10 games, including a win over
and thunderstorms. After the rain 
died down somewhat, the Tar
tans finally took 
the field, and 
when it was all 
over, earned a 2-
0 victory. After a 
lackluster first 
half of play, the 
score*1 stood at
0-0. Midway 
through the sec
ond half, the Tartans began to 
show some signs 
of life as sopho
more midfielder

ted a goal to give 
them a 1-0 
lead.The defense 
continued as ex
pected, holding 
St. Vincent back 
in thei own end, 
and not allowing 
chances on goal. 
Finally, another 
CMU goal by 
first-year for
ward Matt Crummy with only 
minutes remaining produced the 
final score of 2-0.
Three more shutout's, and some 
strong senior leadership in the 
defense, namely by senior defend
ers David Huryk, Eric Hopper, 
Sharif Siddiqui, and goalkeeper 
Benjamin Kartzmah, have helped 
the Tartans to receive national 
recognition, as well as record an 
impressive 10-game unbeaten 
streak. During this tremendous 
streak, they have only surren
dered one goal to the opposition. 
After having a seven-game shut
out streak broken, the team has 
begun a new streak of two 
straight goalless performances 
by the opposition.
The Tartans host two confer
ence matches this weekend. They 
take on Brandeis at 5:30 on Fri
day night, and then Rochester at
11 am on Sunday. With the sea
son dying down, and hopes of an 
NCAA tournament bid running 
high, the team is looking forward 
to extending their run of impres
sive play.
Against the backdrop of Homecoming 
weekend at the University of Chicago, 
the Tartan football team played the role 
of spoiler last weekend as they beat the 
Maroons in dramatic style 13-10. The 
game not only avenged their own home 
loss last year to Chicago, but also put the 
team in a good standing to win back the 
University Athletic Association title from 
the Maroons.
It was like two heavyweight boxers 
going at it, said head coach Rich 
Lackner. There were two very good 
football teams battling until the end. 
Scoring was hard to come by in the 
game while turnovers were plentiful  
six interceptions and two fumbles total, 
including four interceptions and a fumble 
from Tartan senior quarterback 
Russ Clay.
We thought that field position would 
play a big role in the game, and it did, 
said Lackner, remarking that the turn
overs may have been inflated by the 
wind and light rain in the first half.
Chicago managed a field goal in the 
second quarter and the halftime score 
was 3-0 in favor of the Maroons. With 
seven minutes left in the third quarter, 
the Maroons picked off a Clay pass and

CMU took advantage of a turnover them

How a journey to 
Japan turned into a 
great revelation for 
one CMU professor
By DEREK GREENTREE
Tartan Production Manager
Last Thursday, the Soup and Substance lecture 
series and the International Festival committee 
combined to bring the community a lecture by Guy 
Berry, a professor of chemistry, titled Personal and 
Academic Experiences in Japan. Berry, who has 
been to Japan over 30 times and is a visiting pro
fessor at two universities there, structured his talk 
mostly around his familys personal experiences in 
Kyoto, Japan, in the 1960s. Berry emphasized cul
tural differences between Japanese and American 
life, as well as differences between modern Japan 
and the Japan of 30 years ago.
Accompanying the talk were a series of slides 
Berry had taken during his journeys. The first few 
slides illustrated one of Berrys first reactions to 
Japan. Since it is a country about the size of the 
state of California (but with a population of over 
126 million) public places everywhere teem with 
people. The first slide, a blurry scene of a Japanese 
airport filled with people in business suits, was 
not inappropriate as an introduction, said Berry, 
whos first reaction as a Westerner was disorienta
tion. Other cultural differences Berry highlighted 
included the extremely crowded but efficient 
national transportation system in Japan, with the 
famous bullet train between Tokyo and Kyoto as 
an example.

Chinese acrobats enthrall large crowd
By LILYAHN
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
The porcelain bowl, well-poised on 
the ball of the acrobats feet, is found to 
be sitting intact on the acrobats head 
after the complete execution of an arch 
that evokes much awe from the audi
ence. Another acrobat, with a mere 
swivel of the hips, sends a foot-wide 
band of hula-hoops spiraling down her 
body without losing a single one to the 
floor. The same acrobat does an 
arabesque, keeping the hula-hoop 
twirling on her ankle. The music picks 
up pace as male acrobats hoist them
selves toward the ceiling by winding 
ropes around each wrist.
Last Friday night, the Rangos Ball
room in the UC boasted dazzling feats 
of inconceivable agility and balance 
alongside a display of brilliant, cultural 
costumes. The Shangri-La Chinese 
Acrobats from Taiwan demonstrated a 
mastery of inanimate everyday objects, 
ranging from plain bowls to chairs to 
ropes. The acrobats have been perform
ing for over 20 years at hundreds of 
universities, performing arts centers, 
and corporate events.
One girl managed to do a headstand 
with ease at the very peak of a tower of 
stacked chairs. People in the audience 
were asked to throw a soccer ball at one 
acrobat so that he could catch it on the
baton lodged in his mouth. One aerocipline, according to press information show standing against the side walls
bat, no longer a performing artist but 
rather a prop, became a jump rope for 
other acrobats to jump over. Another 
girl distorted her body so that her butt 
joined her head while she lay on her
from the group.
Throughout the show, I kept think
ing, Only CMU can bring such 
an event onto campus, because this 
school is so diverse. The show was
or at the back of the room. Young 
kids stood on chairs, and some were

The audience seemed thoroughly

Garden theater...
Students put on a performance of Othello in the garden of Mudge House on a balmy evening last week.
By ANDY FRANCIS
Tartan Staffwriter
And the World Goes Round, 
the musical review presented 
last weekend by the CMU 
School of Drama, is, if nothing 
else, remarkable for how much 
it differs from most of todays 
popular entertainment. The 
performance, a musical review 
of Cabaret and All That 
Jazz composers John Kander 
and Fred Ebb, was dominated 
by, lets face it, cheesy songs, 
delivered without a trace of 
irony. Or a dull moment, as the 
show was a relentlessly enter
taining review of Kandr and 
Ebbs best-known tunes. 
Although the musical selec
tions came from a variety of 
works, clever use of music and 
lighting helped the show flow 
nicely and let the audience 
enjoy the talents of the eight 
principal performers.
The cast breezed through 28 
of Kander and Ebbs composi
tions during the evening, with 
each featuring one or two of 
the cast members. The tunes 
each had a clear emotional 
character; the lyrics ensured 
that no songs message was 
lost. The cast ran through 
numbers about marriage, 
ambition, money, and a host of 
other topics. A four-piece band 
consisting of keyboards, bass,
drums, and a multi-instrumen
tal reed player provided each 
songs musical backdrop. The 
jazzy, swinging sounds of the 
band fit perfectly with the 
songs and added to the lyrical 
quality of each.
The pace of the show is 
unlike a review in that lights 
and music serve as segues 
between the songs, said 
director Gary Kline. This 
aspect of the performance 
added an excellent cohesive
quality and made certain the. 
audience never lost interest. 
Rather than introduce songs 
or change sets in between, 
new numbers often began 
simply by switching the spot
light to another student. This
Cast members from the Drama Departments And the World Goes Round.
courtesy Drama Department
greatly benefited the show, as 
thematic connections
between the songs were made 
clearer and fit together 
almost as if the performance 
were telling a story.
That said, the real key to the 
performance was the cast. The 
players infused their singing and 
dancing with a sexiness and atti
tude uncharacteristic of CMU. 
Dressed in mostly black outfits 
much like the actual casts of 
Kander and Ebb musicals, the 
performers worked the stage 
expertly, never seeming out of 
place or out of tune. Highlights 
included Emily Tams flamboy
ant reading of Everybodys Girl 
and Justin Brills lovestruck 
Sara Lee. Certainly, any of the 
songs could be considered high 
points, as the cast filled each 
song with an amazing energy 
that they sustained through the 
entire performance.
Musical theater isnt for 
everyone  I, for one, went 
into the show expecting not to 
enjoy it. However, the CMU 
School of Drama performance 
of And the World Goes Round 
was as likely as anything else 
to win fans of the genre. With 
fun, kicky songs and perform
ers who looked like they 
enjoyed the show as much as 
the audience, And the 
World Goes Round was a defi
nite winner.

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon University  18 October 1999L3Gandhi brings message of non-violence to campus
By HEATHER FRANTZ
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
In a society where violence appears 
often, one may forget past leaders who 
led groups to freedom through acts of 
nonviolence. One of these was Mahat
ma Gandhi, who helped to free India 
from Great Britains colonial rule. 
There are individuals and groups fight
ing the problems of society through 
nonviolent actions, and CMU was for
tunate enough to have one of these 
individuals as a keynote speaker for 
the International Festival when Arun 
Gandhi brought his grandfathers mes
sage of nonviolence to Carnegie Mellon 
this past Thursday. Through tales of 
experiences with his grandfather and 
experiences of his own, Gandhi 
related to students, faculty, and com
munity members the spirit of the non
violence movement.
Starting his speech with a call to 
young people to help make the twentyfirst century peaceful, Gandhi said, 
Universities and institutions are 
places where we enlighten ourselves 
and overcome prejudice. He told of a 
personal experience at the University 
of Mississippi, where one day he 
entered the cafeteria and saw that the 
students appeared to be segregated. 
Upon further inspection, Gandhi dis
covered that the students were not seg
regated, but instead each group 
thought the other group did not like 
them. Gandhi showed this to the stu
dents and helped to open their eyes to 
the prejudices around them.
Gandhi also said that physical vio
lence is not the only form of violence 
and cited various states such as eco
nomic, social, religious, and political 
violence. He explained some of these 
types by telling a story from his stay 
with his grandfather.
Young Gandhi once threw a short and 
used pencil into the bushes near his 
home one day because he felt that he 
should have a better pencil.- When he 
got home, his grandfather questioned 
him about the pencil and refused to 
give young Gandhi a new pencil. His 
grandfather instead forced Arun to go 
outside in the dark and search the 
bushes for the small pencil. After hav
ing found the pencil, the older Gandhi
explained to his grandson that a simple 
thing like a pencil had many natural 
resources in it and that by throwing 
away the pencil, young Arun had 
caused violence against nature. His 
grandfather also explained that natur
al resources are over-consumed and 
that there are people in the world who 
are deprived of these resources. 
Because of this, the younger Gandhi 
had also committed violence against 
humanity. All of the little things we do 
every day are acts of violence, he said.
Infuriated by acts committed against 
him when he was young, Arun Gandhi 
was consumed with anger and deter
mined to have revenge on those who 
mistreated him. Only after spending 
time with his grandfather did Gandhi 
learn how to manage his anger. Gandhi 
explained to the audience how anger 
management is not taught to children 
and that anger can destroy us and 
everything around us. He explained we 
must channel anger into positive 
actions because if we abuse anger, we 
can change the course of our lives in an 
instant. He said, Its essential we learn 
not to abuse anger.
In 1994, Gandhi traveled to South 
Africa to conduct workshops and was 
invited to speak to a group of revolu
tionaries who had massacred many 
people only a few weeks earlier. 
Although he was afraid, Gandhi felt he 
must stay true to his lineage and so 
traveled to the gangs village where he 
saw extreme poverty and despair. 
When the gang arrived at the workshop 
with their guns, Gandhi convinced 
them to put their guns down and asked 
what they wanted the most. When the 
group said their biggest priority was 
jobs, he explained to the revolutionar
ies that businesses would not come into 
the village because of the fear of the 
group. After Gandhi left, the group 
went to the police and turned all of 
their guns in. The members of the vil
lage now have jobs and the future looks 
brighter. Gandhi said that the revolu
tionaries still hold their beliefs, but 
now practice nonviolent protests. They 
wanted the same things we want, 
he said.
Gandhi finished his speech by 
explaining that the more civilized we 
become, the more violent we become.
He once again called for a change in the 
next century and said that young peo
ple must figure out where past genera
tions have gone.
Michelle Simmons, a psychology 
major, said, Gandhi showed the audi
ence that people should be an example 
to others and show this by doing. His 
explanation that we must be the 
change we want to see was beautiful.
Currently working out of the M. K. 
Gandhi Institute for Nonviolence,
Gandhi has written several books and 
continues to travel to places such as 
Croatia, Lithuania, and Nicaragua to 
help spread the ideas of nonviolence.
Gandhi was born in Durban, South 
Africa. Growing up in turmoil because 
of his ethnic background, Gandhi found 
great anger in himself because of preju
dicial acts committed against him. In 
hopes of learning how to deal with the 
anger, Gandhi was sent to live with his 
grandfather from age 12 to age 14. In
India, he learned many lessons about 
not only anger, but also the many kinds 
of violence that afflicted society from 
his grandfather. Gandhi now travels 
around the world to spread the mes
sage of nonviolence and he told audi
ence members that his hope was that 
his speech would help to open 
their eyes.
We have to be the change we want to 
see, he said. It has to begin with each 
one of us.

Arun Gandhi told many stories about his grandfather which illustrated the basis of his speech, non-violence.
Speakers shed light on one revolution 
and living conditions in the Middle East
MID-EAST, from page LI
Mohit explained that Persian 
culture includes the heavy 
Islamic influence of the Shiite 
Muslims, who control the gov
ernment and make up most of 
the population. However, there 
have been other influences and 
today other languages and reli
gions exist in the country. Right 
now, Iran seems to be entering a 
transitional phase, away from 
the harsh religious codes of the 
Ayatollah and toward a more 
open society.
Mohit explained that an Iran
ian government was established 
following World War II, when 
. the British Empire left the 
region. That government was 
toppled by a coup sponsored by 
.the West, including the United 
States. The coup installed the 
. Shahs as rulers of Iran, but fur
ther cultivated the seeds of antiWestern sentiment placed by 
the British. Finally, in 1977, the 
Ayatollah Khomeini seized con
trol of Iran and the religiously 
dominated government known 
today has been in place 
ever since.
In the 1980s, Iran fought 
against Iraq, which at the time 
was aided by the United States. 
That war did not end until 1988. 
More than a million died, with 
billions of dollars in destruction.
Recently, previously forbidden 
cultural exchanges have begun 
with the West. In 1997, Presi
dent Mohammed Khatami 
began trying to establish dia
logues with the U.S. and other 
Western Countries. In Iran, stu
dents and a younger generation 
have begun to demand a relax
ing of strict social rules, includ
ing the ones that prevent women 
from being able to divorce, wear 
clothes that reveal more than 
their faces, or exercise the legal 
rights that men enjoy.
I think the new movement in 
Iran that I see  the choice of 
the Iranian people, which has 
resulted in the election of Mr. 
Khatami, is towards a dialogue 
with all of the world based on 
mutual respect, said Mohit. 
This can include any country, 
even the U.S. Internally, the 
move is towards building a 
civil society.
Mohit spent the summer in 
Iran. He said that media sources 
are expanding and knowledge of 
the world and politics in Iran is 
growing, despite some of the 
governments efforts. What he 
wanted was slow and peaceful 
change. A country that spent 
nearly a decade at war with a 
neighbor now turns inward and 
looks at itself. Mohit was confi
dent that change has happened, 
and wants further change, but 
peacefully and without violence.
Waziruddin painted a picture 
of Saudi Arabia through the 
eyes of an expatriate, a foreign
er living inside of the country 
and working. His story included 
some history of Saudi Arabia, 
but focused on what he sees as 
where the country is today.
Waziruddin was born in Cana
da to a mother from Pakistan 
and a father from India. In 1982 
his family moved to the city of 
Riyadh in Saudi Arabia. In 1986 
they left for a few years to live in 
Pakistan and then Canada, but 
his family returned to Saudi 
Arabia where he lived until com
ing to Carnegie Mellon.
I had never before attempted 
to comprehensively speak about 
growing up in Saudi Arabia as a 
foreigner, said Waziruddin. As 
that has been a significant part 
of my life, I thought it might be 
helpful personally to organize 
and articulate my thoughts on 
that part of my life.
In many ways Waziruddin
was not unlike a large number 
of people in Saudi Arabia. A 
third of the population is made 
up of foreigners working for 
extended periods of time in the 
country. That third of the popu
lation lives separated from the 
other two thirds that are citi
zens. According to Waziruddin, 
homes for expatriates are locat
ed in compounds that can meet 
all of the residents needs inde
pendently, if desired. He said 
that the physical separation of 
living spaces does not prevent 
interaction, though it does limit 
cultural exchange in some ways.
The government of Saudi Ara
bia is headed by a royal family. 
The king, a Suni Muslim, is the 
head of one of a number of tribes 
in Saudi Arabia that periodical
ly vie for control of the country. 
Waziruddin felt that the govern
ment was conservative and less 
radical than other countrys gov
ernments. He said that they like 
to portray themselves as nonaligned when it comes to the 
regional conflicts that at times 
seem poised to engulf the region.
That notion of independence 
has been tested in the last few 
years. Waziruddin was sur
prised that U.S. troops were 
allowed in Saudi Arabia for the 
Persian Gulf War with Iraq, and 
he was surprised that some of 
those troops remain today. The 
close ties between Israel and the 
United States tested the willing
ness of Saudi Arabia to go along 
with being allied with the Unit
ed States during the war. How
ever, the alliance remains to 
this day.
A central theme of Waziruddins talk Was the internal ten
sion .of Saudi Arabia. Expatri
ates and citizens maintain a bal
ance between living together 
and mixing culture that is 
managed by the government.
Sometimes certain groups, 
such as Shiite Muslims, 
suffer discrimination.
In Saudi Arabia the Shiites 
live where most of the oil is 
located. Their minority status 
has meant that they receive lit
tle of the revenue from that oil 
and that the Suni government 
receives most of it. According to 
Waziruddin, expatriate Shiites 
receive the harshest treatment 
because* of suspicions that they 
work for foreign governments.
At other times all groups seem 
to coexist. The government 
acts as arbitrator  sometimes 
being lax and permissive 
other times being harsh
and restrictive.
According to Waziruddin, 
Saudi Arabia is culturally less 
permissive than the U.S. The 
state controls the media, and 
numerous challenges to the gov
ernment receive no coverage or 
acknowledgement.
Socially, women enjoy fewer 
freedoms, like in Iran. Wazirud
din said that religious police 
enforce conduct in public and pre
vent unrelated members of oppo
site sexes from associating.
Both speakers used their plat
forms and their perspectives to 
help educate those who came and 
hopefully break down stereotypes 
that might be held.
I think that even if some coun
try, culture, or ideology becomes 
misrepresented, it is important 
for other people to be able to sub
jectively see things from another 
perspective..., said Waziruddin. 
This, I hope, reduces dogmatism 
in general. I also think that there 
is a desire among people to expe
rience other cultures or environ
ments, and for many this [inter
national festival is a very good 
opportunity to do that without 
traveling very far.
Teacher's working 
trip turns personal
JAPAN, from page LI
Life at home was another focus 
of Berrys talk, including exam
ples about the Japanese practice 
of uniforms for schoolchildren; 
small, inconvenient washing 
machines; and separate stores 
for rice, fish, and other groceries. 
Academically, students in Japan 
attend the same university for 
graduate and undergraduate 
studies. According to Berry, 
many of the older universities of 
Japan seem very institutional
ized in their architecture.
Berrys other anecdotes 
included a thorough descrip
tion of the Japanese tea cere
mony  a very ritualized, for
mal, and solemn event, where 
everything must be exact, 
down to the number of bristles 
on the brush used to mix the 
tea  as well as tradition, reli
gion, and holidays in Japan. In 
terms of inconveniences, Berry 
noted the extreme popularity of 
smoking in Japan where,
unlike here, restaurants do not 
have smoking and nonsmoking 
sections. Berry also noted that 
the Japan of 30 years ago was 
not a very convenient place for 
people with handicaps.
Although the group in atten
dance was small, students said 
they were pleased and enter
tained by the lecture. It was 
very enlightening and informa
tive to hear about the unique 
differences between American 
and Japanese culture ... for 
example, the tea ceremony. [It 
was fascinating] to learn about 
how an industrialized country 
on the other end of the world 
does things, said Sudhair 
Gopal, a graduate student in 
the Heinz School. A few Japan
ese students were in atten
dance. Hiroko Okada, a music 
major, said, Some of the pic
tures were quite old [but] what 
he said was very true. [It Was 
exciting] to hear how an Amer
ican feels about Japan.

selected through an audition process at 
the beginning of the fall semester and

True, its not much time, but the final

Actors just cant get along
By BALAJI SARPESHKAR
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
Remember how, as a young 
child, you were scolded for fight
ing? It was always the easiest 
way to get into trouble just hit 
the person who was annoyingyou. 
In Fight Club, the latest film from 
David Fincher (Seven), we see 
that fighting may not get you 
yelled at, but just may lead to 
total chaos.
Early on, we are introduced to 
a young office-dweller (Edward 
Norton) who has no name, and 
will be referred to hereafter as 
Our Hero. We learn, through 
clever use of voice-overs, that Our
Twentieth Century Fox 
Ed Norton (I) and Brad Pitt (r) in Fight Club.
Hero has been suffering from in
somnia. After discovering that 
attending support group meet
ings helps him to fall asleep at 
night, he becomes addicted to
them.
After some time, he finds that 
another faker has also started 
attending these meetings. Her 
name is Marla Singer (Helena 
Bonham Carter), and her view is 
that the meetings are better 
than the movies, and you get 
free coffee.
On the way back from a busi
ness trip he meets a more inter
esting character: Tyler Durden 
(Brad Pitt). Tyler Durden makes 
and sells soap. We learn 
little else about Tyler except for 
this little tidbit. After Our Hero 
returns home, however, and finds 
that his condo has blown up in a 
mysterious accident, he learns 
that Tyler 
Durden may be 
his only hope. He 
then calls Tyler, 
and, after a 
brief, almost to
tally random, 
fight outside of a 
bar, Our Hero 
ends up staying 
at Tylers place.
Now, for some 
strange reason, 
both Tyler and 
Our Hero enjoyed their fight, and 
end up repeating the same fight 
scene, outside of the same 
bar. They soon draw a crowd of 
onlookers, who are understand
ably intrigued. Eventually, these 
onlookers become participants 
in what Tyler and Our Hero term 
Fight Club.
It is at about this point that the 
plot begins to spiral out of control. 
Fight Club is moved to the base
ment of the bar, and the crowd 
grows larger yet. As a special bo
nus, Tyler beats the tar out of the 
owner of the bar when he tries to 
scare the participants away. 
Before long, recruits for a myste
rious Project Mayhem start 
showing up at Tylers front door, 
asking to be part of the action.
This project soon leads to a whole 
lot of black-clad militia-type 
psychos running around, wreak
ing havoc in the name of Tyler 
Durden. As for Our
Hero, he tries to back out of the 
whole affair, but finds that 
Tyler wont let him. That leads to 
... well, Im not about to give away 
the ending, but lets
just say its not exactly for the 
faint of heart.
Fight Club is a most interesting 
film. Director David Fincher has 
certainly seemed to succeed 
in bringing us a film thats just 
as strange. Theres a lot of sarcas
tic humor in the early stages, 
but the story grows increasingly 
bloody and totally twisted by the 
end. But, if you want to see 
violence, you wont be disappointed.
Film fails to sway critic
By THADDEUS BILLMAN
Tartan Staffwriter
It is not often that a film fails 
on virtually all levels. In that 
regard, After Life is a truly spe
cial film.
The film takes place in a kind 
of holding zone between life 
on Earth and eternal hap
piness. When someone dies 
he or she must choose one, 
and only one, memoiy to 
retain when he or she moves 
on. Once someone makes a 
decision, the remainder of 
one week is spent recreat
ing the memory.
The plot of the film is in
teresting in principle, but 
doesnt really provide 
enough substance for a fulllength film. Consequently, 
the film drags on and on and on.
downright amazing considering 
how little substance there is to 
begin with. Some scenes are too 
brief to serve a purpose, while 
others drag on forever.
The whole film is quite trite. 
Each character ends up picking a 
memory that is not only boring,
Nearly two hours Ion g, After Life 
could have been done in less 
than 30 minutes and nothing 
would have been lost. Pointless 
scene after pointless scene runs 
across the screen, leaving the 
viewer plenty of time to catch up 
on lost sleep.
The film provides a mere re
counting of each characters fa
vorite memory, and nearly fails 
to do even that. Random scene 
changes and poor editing often 
confuse the viewer, which
fvNki TfkvvyEMynNyi Assistant Art Editor
but also cliched. For example, 
theres the old man who chooses a 
memory of sitting on a park bench 
with his wife. I mean, who ever 
thought that spending time alone 
with ones spouse would be a 
happy memory? Then there is 
the teenage girl who first-chooses 
a memory of Disneyland before 
reconsidering and choosing a 
memory of being held by her 
mother as a young girl.
Someone who first chooses a su
perficial memory, then switches 
to a more meaningful one after
thinking it over? Wow, I sure 
didnt see that coming.
The acting certainly doesnt 
help the dry script much. The 
parts are' played without any 
emotion or understanding. It is 
difficult to blame the actors for 
this problem, however, as 
they had very 
little to work with. 
It surely isnt easy 
to get emotionally, 
involved with a 
plot that seems to 
go nowhere. !
The worst part 
about After Life is 
that the film 
thinks it is  a 
lot more than it 
is. The director 
apparently 
thought he was, 
being some kind of artistic genius 
with meticulous character devel
opment, when in reality nothing 
is revealed about these charac
ters. The writer thinks he is be
ing creative and funny, when 
he is actually trite and boring. 
Worst of all, the film thinks that; 
it is portraying some kind of dejep 
meaning, that it has the answer to 
the meaning of life. In reality; 
it is nothing more than mundane 
observations that someoneone1 
would have a hard time finding
inventive or unique in any way.1
Talented orchestra gives noteworthy, yet inconsistent performance
By THADDEUS BILLMAN
Tartan Staffwriter
Theyve got talent. Theyve got style. 
Its too bad they werent able to show it 
more consistently.
On Saturday, the Carnegie Mellon 
Philharmonic held their latest concert 
at the Carnegie Music Hall. The show, 
which was part of the International Fes
tival, was approximately an hour and a 
half long and featured four pieces.
The first piece consisted of selections 
from J.S. Bachs Art of the Fugue. The
performance-was rather mediocre. At 
times the violins sounded a little off-key 
and often seemed out of place. 
The oboes and bassoons were not played 
loud enough and could barely be heard. 
On the other hard, the keyboard move
ments were excellent, and they certainly 
captured the feeling of the piece. 
The lead cello player was exceptional; 
she expressed the emotion of the work 
with beauty.
The second piece was an interesting 
number by Japanese composer Toru 
Takemitsu called Star-Isle. The work
provided a nice change of pace from the 
steady diet of European composers one 
normally hears. The piece was wellsuited for its position in the program, 
right before intermission, and was wellplayed by all parties involved.
After a brief intermission, the pro
gram continued with Hymnos by 
Giacinto Scelsi. Unfortunately, this piece 
was a major dark spot of the concert. 
The music is loud and chaotic. 
Standing alone, the piece might work, 
but in this concert it did not. The clutter 
and disorder of the work leaves the listener confused and perhaps angered. It 
leads to awkward emotions as the lis
tener is torn away from the performance 
almost as if someone were playing loud, 
annoying music in the room next door. 
The performance of the piece was 
not necessarily bad; it was more a ques
tion of poor music selection.
The final piece was the famous Bolero 
by Maurice Ravel. It was a very smart 
idea to put this work last, as it was by far 
the best of the afternoon. Combining the 
best composition and the best perfor
mance, Bolero stood far above the other
pieces. This beautiful number was 
performed at a level that would rival the 
best orchestras in the country. 
The flutes and oboes were absolutely 
beautiful. The string instruments were 
incredible, as was the saxophonel:. 
The whole orchestra delivered the piece 
with incredible power and emotion. 
At its completion, the work received, 
and certainly deserved, a standing 
ovation. The movement was performed 
at near-genius level; its just too bad the 
rest of the presentation wasnt able to1 
follow suit.

Life Is Beautiful
Thursday, October 21
The University Center has recently received a lot of 
publicity about its architectural connections to Nazi 
Germany. To improve our public image, we should 
thus hire lead actor Roberto Benigni to work at 
Entropy to bring humor to the sadness. Cant you 
picture him joking around while selling sottacetos'(n-un-sacchetto (pickles-in-a-bag) and slushies blu 
del lampone (blue raspberry slushies)?
The film has two major parts. In the first half, he 
tries to woo a woman using his charming sense of 
humor. She cannot resist his wit and marries him. 
The second part takes place several years later after 
they have a son. The three of them find themselves 
being tragically taken away to a concentration camp. 
There, Benigni continually uses his humor again to 
Shield the ghastly horrors of the camp from his son, 
while trying to maintain his own fleeting belief in 
human goodwill.

you watched over and over again when you first got

a South Park animation thats about ten times the 
length, and ten times as irreverent. I dont know 
what to say about this movie to possibly prepare you 
for it, since even the Bill Gates jokes are pretty rash.

Austin Powers 2: The Spy Who Shagged Me
Saturday, October 23
If you havent heard of this movie, heres some 
advice for you. First, I suggest you eat some Wheaties 
or take some creatine. Then, begin a rigorous weight
lifting routine. If all goes well, after a few weeks, 
youll develop super strength. With super strength, 
you should be able to lift off the gigantic rock that you 
have been living under for the last five months!
But Ill give you the benefit of the doubt. You 
probably know what the movies about. So I have 
nothing left to spew except stupid information. For 
example, while shag is a relatively mild word in our 
sick and dirty American culture, it is very offensive 
in others. In Singapore, the movie was called The 
Spy Who Shioked Me, where shioke means to 
treat nicely. Try using that as a pick-up line.

Whats the difference? For starters, Flash Gordon is a

the Merciless is trying destroy the Earth.
Flesh Gordon will also be playing, and it will also 
 feature a character of the same name. If you didnt 
watch Flash Gordon, youd think this was just a bad 
porno. But if you saw Flash beforehand, youll enjoy 
;all the cheesy references (i.e. characters Emperor 
Wang and Dr. Flexi Jerkoff) in addition to the nudity.
Finally, Trash Gordon is a guy who works for a 
minor league franchise near my home. Hes dressed in 
; a tuxedo and walks the aisles collecting trash. Mean
while, the aforementioned Flash is blared over the 
loudspeakers when hes introduced. I always feel bad

The Dillinger Escape Plan 
Calculating Infinity 
Relapse Records
Holy Moly! Be scared. Be VERY 
scared. The 10-legged monster 
known as The Dillinger Escape 
Plan will destroy you with their 
technical blasts of brutality. This 
extreme tech-metal outfit from 
New Jersey has been highly ac
claimed and taken in with open 
arms by the hardcore and metal 
scenes since their conception in 
1996. They have two EPs under 
their belt, and Calculating Infin
ity is their first full-length, ex
hibiting 11 unrelenting tracks of 
off-beat rhythms, blazingly fast 
guitar work, piercing drum blasts, 
and searing vocals. From the be
ginning of the album, dauntingly 
fast electronic-sounding notes 
tickle the ears, in preparation for 
the gripping onslaught of tense, 
sonic blasts only three seconds 
away. The tremendous power of 
this group comes from their con
centrated bursts of aggression.
The Dillinger Escape Plans

that of any band on the market. Don Caballero

like: Did I stutter? What? Did I

and you earned it. Take a bow, 
you deserve it. Eat sh-t, you 
earned it. Life would be so much 
better if you did not exist, you 
know they mean business. The 
Dillinger Escape Plan is truly an 
incredible audio experience that 
will change your view on the ex

sounds.
CLIFF CHIEN
To anyone unfamiliar with the 
group Don Caballero, the name 
may bring to mind the Hispanicinfluenced pop sounds of Ricky 
Martin or Enrique Iglesias. Hold 
on to your sombreros, though, 
because these boys are no com
parison. Don Caballero is actu
ally a group of Pittsburgh-bornand-bred hard-rockers.
Don Caballero released their 
first album, For Respect, in 1993, 
followed by 1995s double album 
Don Caballero 2. Containing only 
one previously unreleased track, 
their new album, Singles Break
ing Up, is a compilation of tracks 
from their last two albums. 
It is a great CD for anyone new to 
the Don Caballero scene, as it 
provides a comprehensive look at 
the unique style of these Pitts
burgh boys. It is a style that can
not be called heavy metal, but 
under no circumstances can be 
classified as easy listening either, 
though the fact that this group is

soulful tracks that are driven by 
the captivating percussion skills 
of the bands drummer and leader 
Damon Che. With such a power
ful bass, it is no wonder this 
band has chosen to remain an 
all-instrumental group. Some
times angry, sometimes just out 
to have some fun, the songs on 
this album take the listener on 
an unpredictable ride. No words 
needed here; this music speaks 
for itself.

Horoscopes by Momo Starbuck
Texe asBoyChi
Momo has returned from her 
mid-semester hiatus friskier than 
ever. I went to Toronto for some 
R&R at a B&B with my girls 
Star Jones and Kathie Lee 
Gifford. After a weekend of pil
low fights, facials, and tons of girl 
talk, Ill tell you this much: Im 
glad I was drunk.
Libra
(September 23-October 23)
Your taste for the finer things 
in life is commendable, Leebs, 
but you may be getting a bit out of 
hand with your decadence. 
Caviar and wine flowfree for now, 
but soon youll be knee deep in 
Fresca and Funyuns. Unless 
youve got a yen for gas-station 
fare, I suggest you start cutting 
back on your spending.
Scorpio
(October 24-November 21)
As Liza Minelli once told me 
Scorp, you can never have too 
much love in your life. 
Of course, what did Liza know 
about love? Her coke-head mother 
was always busy surreptitiously 
refillingher Valium prescriptions 
and milking that Oz gig for every 
last drug-money dime. I only 
know this because she was a close 
friend of mine. ... Who do you
think was refilling all of those 
prescriptions?
Sagittarius
(November 22-December 21)
Saggie, whats up, freak? You 
are a sight for sore eyes. Ive heard 
all kinds of shit about you lately. 
Whats up with your recent sur
gery? I heard it was a success and 
that they were able to remove 
that growth without damaging 
your other two you-know-whats. 
You should be running around 
shirtless and carefree in no time.
Capricorn
(December 22-Januai'y 19)
Your tendency to alienate your
self from others is interfering 
with your social life, Cappy. You 
used to be the life of the party, 
but no more. Its been months 
since anyones seen your ass at 
one of these soirees. I realize the 
comforts of home beckon, but 
theres always time to lounge 
around eating Bugles and play
ing Playstation. Lets get cheeky!
Aquarius
(January 20-February 18)
Its time to stop putting off that 
long-needed personal renovation, 
Quares. Before you start construc
tion on yourself, though, you need 
to get an electric stud finder and 
then let the nailing bgin. 
In case youre in need a good pipe 
cleaning as well, get in touch with 
Frankie, ties my absolute favor
ite plumber.
Pisces
(February 19-March 20)
A wise old pig once told me,

Dont count your chickens be
fore theyre hatched. What do 
pigs know about chickens, you 
might ask. Well, plenty. I mean, 
she was a farmer. I only call her 
a pig because she was a horrid fat 
ass. But other than that, sweet 
woman, sweet sweet woman.
Aries
(March 21-April 19)
You are suffering from a raging 
case of delusions of grandeur, my 
sweet Aries. To put it bluntly, 
you aint all that. The sooner you 
realize your limitations, the 
sooner youll enable yourself to 
achieve new levels of mediocrity. 
Listen, theres no shame in being 
a loser, just look at your parents.
Taurus
(April 20-May 20)
This is your time to shine, and 
I dont mean the glare from your 
greasy combination skin, Taurie. 
For that, I recommend some 
pressed powder in a neutral shade 
or wearing a paper bag over your 
head. That should take the shine 
offinnotime. Just dont forget to 
excuse yourself from the table 
before you do italso, cut a hole 
in' the bag big enough to fit your 
dinner through.
Gemini
(May 21-June 21)
As the fall winds start to blow, 
you find yourself indulging in 
decadent autumnal pleasures. Of 
course, these sorts of things come 
with a price, Gemmie. Pumpkin 
patches are full of sticky burrs 
and annoying children, and trick 
or treating always leaves you in
the holding cell claiming the its^ 
just my costume defense to pub
lic indecency charges.
Cancer
(June 22-July 22)
I sense a profound sadness 
about you, Cancer. You have re-, 
cently suffered quite a loss, but 
this week will be your time to' 
recover and move on. Take ad-, 
vantage of those around you for 
that much-needed support. Not 
too funny this week is it?
Leo
(July 23-August 22)
In Momos yearbook, Leo, you 
would have been voted most likely 
to succeed. Unfortunately, after 
the glory days of your high school 
years have faded, youre plain most 
likely to suck. Its true that your 
best years are behind you, butdont 
let it get you down. You still have 
time to make a miraculous turn
around. Just look at your dear 
Momo. I went from a washed-up, 
aging slut to the preeminent astro
logical mind of my day.
Virgo
(August 23-September 22)
Momos so very proud ofher sweet 
Virgo. To think, just a few short 
weeks ago, I was sure that you 
wouldnt make it this far without a 
major nervous breakdown. I had 
less confidence in you than in my 
recovering drug addict ex-con 
transsexual roommate Jesse. 
However, youve proven me wrong. 
Youve been diligently stroking 
your emotional privates until the 
point of climactic ecstatcy. Mean
while, Jesse s back to his old tricks.
