Volume 66N um bec*#"Wednesday, May 3, 1967Committees Form Long, Short Range Skibo Plans
Skibo is again under fire. 
Current criticisms and pro
posed plans fall into two cate
gories  long-range improve
ments such as those suggested 
by Chairman Dr. Forehand 
and his faculty committee on 
Student Life, and the immedi
ate future, which is called by 
Student Union Committee. 
When asked to comment on 
his committees proposal 
Dr. Forehand made it clear 
that his committees job isnt 
to plan the work, but to put 
forth suggestions and opin
ions. He went on to say the 
building is inadequate for 
campus needs now. Elaborat
ing, he pointed out the prob
lems of poor design and poor 
facilities as the major flaws 
of Skibo. His committees sug
gestions include a study room 
and semi-library where stu
dents could go anytimeday 
or night, and rooms set aside 
for non-arts students with 
art interests where they 
could go to practice piano, 
to paint, etc. Of course, ac
complishing this requires ma
jor additionspossibly a new 
wing; possibly a new Skibo. 
But these suggested changes 
are designed with an eye to 
the distant future; hence de
tails and dates are vague, and 
actual construction will not 
be seen by even todays 
freshman.
Revealed behind this current 
discussion is a general dissatis
faction of Skibo as it is. This 
disapproval not only grows from 
Skibos present lack of comfort 
end service, but also from tits 
overall bad design. To track 
down specific flaws and examine 
them more closely, Mr. Carl D. 
Thomas of the physical plan
ning department is conducting 
a study of Skibo, to determine 
what its problems are and how 
much needs to be done in mak
ing useful changes. His findings 
will probably be added to both 
faculty and student suggestion 
to develop long-range plans for 
a better student union.
Highlander, Snack Bar
The plans for the immediate 
future are dominated by the 
Student Union Committee. The 
rejected plans for $100,000 worth 
of furnishings for the Highland
er Room were sent back to the 
drawing board, revamped and 
cut down to $10,000. These new 
plans have been re-submitted 
and are now being conisdered. 
According to the Chairman of 
the Student Union Committee, 
Sharen Rambo, these plans have 
a good chance of being ap
proved. The plans call for car
peting, new furniture, and per
haps a lower ceiling  hung 
down from the upper one. But 
until they get a definite ok, the 
Highlander Room will stay as 
it is. It is now a dressing room 
for the current SnS Pippin, Pip(Continued on Page 7)

Carnegie Student Art Show, 
which has run for the past 
week. The show is a hanging 
of the work of 65 day stu
dents, primarily painters, with 
contributions from architec
ture, drama and music stu
dents.
A collection of over 800 pieecs

a chance to show and sell their 
work. It includes paintings, 
prints, woodcuts, ceramics, fab
rics, and sculpture.

untl the end of the show.
At the end of the first week, 
over 100 pieces had been sold. 
The show is open all day and 
evening and is staffed by stu
dents in the painting depart
ment. Co-chairmen for this 
years show are juniors Marilyn 
Blitz and Ron Beckman.
67-68 Scimitars 
Serve Carnival
Have you ever wondered 
what goes on behind the scenes 
during a big weekend at Car
negie Tech. Its nice to have 
someone around to build the 
sorority booths, set up the 
plank for jousting, decorate 
for Saturdays dance and per
form many of the other small 
but vital preparations for 
Spring Carnival. Chances are 
that you will see these people 
involved In many other areas 
of Tech life, because this par
ticular group constitutes next 
years Scimitars.
Scimitars, since its formation 
in 1933, has had a two-fold pur
pose: first to honor the out
standing freshmen who have dis
tinguished themselves by their 
academic performance and their 
extracurricular participation; 
and second, to contribute to the 
enrichment of Carnegie Tech 
campus life. It is for this latter 
purpose that Scimitars are im
portant contributors to fresh
man Orientation, Homecoming, 
and Spring Carnival.

Tartan Reviews Position Papers 
For The New College of Liberal Arts
by John Mera
The legal merger of Car
negie Tech with Mellon Insti
tute will come about on July
1, 1967, culminated by the 
creation, in the legal sense, of 
Carnegie University.
Since the announcement in 
October 1966, the faculty and 
administration have been meet
ing to discuss respective changes 
in curricula and administrative 
policies. The closest date to the 
realization of Carnegie Univer
sity is a year and a half away, 
but it may be as far as five 
years from now.
The merger will be most 
beneficial to the College of En
gineering and Science because 
it gains access to the research 
facilities of Mellon Institute. 
Therefore the Tartan has been 
following with particular inter
est, the steps that Dean Mullins 
has been taking in the trans
ition from the present aims and 
goals to those of the University. 
Most notable are the changes 
proposed in the curriculum.
A committee headed by Dean 
Mullins and made up of depart
ment heads and interested fa
culty is presently deliberating 
the proposals submitted by 
Dean Steinberg of MMCC and 
Dean Cyert from GSIA.
Dean Steinbergs plan, pub
lished in a 16 page folder, 
proposes the creation of a Col
lege of Humanities and Social 
Sciences in addition to the 
College of Engineering and 
Science, The College of Fine 
Arts and Margaret Morrison 
Carnegie College.
The engineering student 
would be enrolled in a four year
program. In the freshman year 
the curriculum would consist of 
four core courses in humanties, social sciences, mathema
tics, and foreign languages. In 
subsequent years training in a 
chosen field would begin in ad
dition to integrating courses de
signed to relate their (the stu
dents) own disciplines to cur
rent problems. The student go
ing on to graduate school will 
get rigorous instruction in his 
chosen field, but he needs less 
concentration in a single field 
than the student who ends his 
education after four years. 
Therefore the curriculum for 
the student going on to grad
uate school will consist of more 
liberal arts and integrating 
courses with a high degree of 
specialization coming in the 
graduate years. For the student 
who will seek a job after four 
years, the curriculum will con
sist of more professionally or
iented courses with liberal arts 
and integrating courses design
ed to relate their chosen sub
ject to contemporary issues. 
The central idea of Dean Stein
bergs plan is the College of Hu
manities and Social Sciences 
which will be a degree-granting 
division of Carnegie University. 
H&SS would be accepting stu
dents in the fall of 1968. The en
gineering student will receive 
his liberal arts education by 
taking courses in H&SS and can 
also select a minor from the 
broad spectrum of courses of
fered. Engineering courses will 
be taken in E&S.

Indonesian Festival On Campus May 9-13
The Carnegie Tech YM-YWC A 
and the International Club 
are sponsoring an Indonesian 
Festival this month. There 
will be an exhibition of In
donesian musical instruments 
and hand-crafts in the Skibo 
Lobby on May 9 throlugh 13. 
On Saturday, May 13, a group 
of professional Indonesian ar
tists are coming to the cam
pus to give a performance in 
Skibo ballroom at 8 pm. This 
group of 32 men and women 
has appeared in several major 
cities in the U.S. They will per
form several Indonesian clas
sical and court dances, such 
as the well known Balinese 
legong dance. The group is 
bringing their own authentic 
gamelan orchestra, consist
ing of wooden, bamboo, and 
brass percussion instruments. 
They will play several game
lan overtures. Brief explana
tions and demonstrations as 
to the function of each instru
ment will be given.
The coordinator of the Inter
national Festival Committee,
Krishnahadi Pribadi, reports 
that the artists visit to Carnegie 
Tech campus is by the courtesy 
of the Indonesian Embassy in 
Washington, D. C. Although they 
are giving the performance free, 
the sponsoring groups have to 
cover their transportation and 
room and meal expenses. Since 
the school could not provide the 
funds this year, Mr. Pribadi 
hopes that the sale of tickets, 
which are $1.50 for students and 
$3 for non-students, could cover 
these expenses. Tickets are on 
sale at the Y office, room 57, 
Skibo.
In addition, the committee 
needs assistance from faculty 
members or anyone who could 
keep one or two of the guests 
at their homes for one night, 
Saturday, May 13. Courtesy tic
kets will be issued in return for 
their assistance.
The Y and the International 
Club hope that this Festival will 
not only be entertaining and in
teresting, but also educational, 
and will become part of Carne
gie Tech tradition.

The Son of the loved One underground niimor-Oh Roz, Poor Bobby. Shown Ma> c
Richard Quinines Oh Dad, Poor Dad;
Moms Hung You in the Closet and 
Im Feeling So Sad.
by Stan Thomas
Last year The Loved One promised to offend everyone 
and simply ended up being offensive. This year the film that 
plans saturation bombing on all the sacred cows of modem 
America and simply ends up bombing the film version of the 
play that started the vogue of marathon titles: Oh Dad, Poor 
Dad, Mommas Hung You In The Closet and Im Feeling So 
Sad.
One of the major problems the filmers of the play had 
to face was the fact that the title is also a plot synopsis 
which should give you an idea of the complexity of the go
ings on. To go into detail about the plot is only to say that 
Madame Rosepettle travels around with her dead husband 
who she has had stuffed and heir living son Who might as 
well be. The only character not mentioned in the title who 
amounts to anything is Rosalee, a babysitter who has a 
habit of seducing the babies she sits for. The saving grace 
of the play was its simplicity and broad caricature of four 
types. Over-stuffed Mother, Smithered Son, Over-blown 
Babysitter, and one of Mothers' victims: one Admiral Hoseabove. The play however was little more than a latent het
erosexual fantasya soporific Suddenly Last Summer.
The film is an example of four excellent performers lost 
at sea with a director who has no idea to save them. Rosa
lind Russell, Bobby Morse, Barbara Harris, and Hugh Grif
fith do their best to keep the craft afloat, but they are as 
much at sea as everyone else concerned with the production.
As if everything werent in enough trouble, Jonathan 
Winters, who plays the late Mr, Rosepettle in a silent film 
which Madame shows to her perspective victims, has also 
been prevailed upon to provide a narration that ranges from 
bad taste to unfunny. I believe it was added to save the 
film, but its rather like the final insult.
The film is being shown at the Shadyside Theatre.

The Oscar awards turned out about as everyone expect
ed and I have only one comment about the entire preceedings: Julie Christies mini-formal was the only appropriate 
mode of dress at the entire non-sectarian service.

Rate Increased for 
International Mail
postmaster E. G. Coll advised 
that Monday, May 1, is the date 
the scheduled increase in inter
national surface and air mail 
rates went into effect.
The new international rates 
will not apply to members of 
the Armed Forces overseas. Do
mestic postage rates are appli
cable to mail addressed to APOs 
and FPOs.
This is the first general in
crease in surface and and air
mail rates since July, 1961. The 
changes are:
1. Airmail letters to Central 
America and Caribbean area 
from 13c a half ounce to 15c.
2. Airmail to the rest of the 
Western Hemisphere remains 
15c a half ounce, except for 
Canada and Mexico.
3. Airmail to Europe and Medi
terranean Africa from 15c a
half ounce to 20c.
4. Airmail letter rates to the rest 
of the world remain unchanged 
at 25c a half ounce.
5 Aerogrammes and air post 
cards increased 2c each from 
11c to 13c.
".Most letters going to by sur
face transportation to all na
tions (excluding Canada and 
Mexico) increased from 11c to 
13c. Post cards raised from 
7c to 8c.
7. Surface parcel post rates to 
all nations increased 20c a 
parcel, an average of seven 
per cent.
Minor increases are scheduled 
for printed matter, books, and 
periodicals sent by surface or 
air to foreign countries except 
Canada. New rates on these 
items are available at service 
windows at all post office sta
tions and branches.
Postmaster Coll said that pos
tage rates for surface first class 
letters and air letters and sur
face third class type printed 
matter to Canada and Mexico, 
correspond to U. S. domestic 
rates, which are set by Congress 
and are not being changed at 
this time.

Despite the fact that it is rather difficult to parody something 
that is already a parody itself, Casino Royale in its preposterous 
way manages to outdo any of its Bondian or Pseudo-Bondian 
(Matt Helm, Flint) predecessors. According to the credits, the 
screen play was suggested by Ian Flemings novel; yet probably 
about the only thing taken from Flemings novel was the title. 
Along with the Bond Mystique, this film had the benefit of a bud
get in the high priced neighborhood of $12,000,000according to 
Varietyand a cast list that would seem to have included just 
about everybody who was left out from Is Paris Burning? Five 
directors (John Huston, Joe McGrath, Val Guest, Robert Parrish, 
and Ken Hughes) worked on this film at various times, although 
one would really have no idea who worked on what sequences. 
The script in its loose jointed, offbeat, improbable construction, 
suggests a collab oration between Woody Allen and some the
atre of the Absurd playwright. What emerges from all the mas
sive expense, effort and time lavished on this film is a visually 
beautiful, sometimes very funnythough often strainedcom
pletely improbable grabbag.
The basic plot is completely indescribable; it includes a spy 
school in Berlin, Peter Sellers as a famous baocaret player and 
spy, a scene with a flying saucer in Trafalgar Square, and a 
scene with the United States Cavalary and a tribe of Indians 
fighting it out in the Casino. The ending to all this is quite appro
priate: an atomic bomb goes off sending the whole crew, cow
boys and Indians included up to heaven. Orson Welles, a cinematic 
magician in his own right, appears briefly as an evil card playing 
agent, who as a hobby performs neat little magical tricks. There 
is also Woody Allen as a neurotic master-mind who devises a 
scheme which will have all men over the height of four foot six 
destroyed, while all women will be made beautiful. There is also 
enough material to fill three other movies; along the way passing 
salutes are given to the Mack Sennit cops, Jean Paul Belmondo, 
George Raft, and the German expressionist movement embodied 
in Dr. Calgario. Woody Allen, although uncredited on the screen
play, probably contributed a great deal, judging by some of thert;
absurd conversations and situations. There are some really hilari
ous scenes and pieces of business, unfortunately the whole show 
was not as well organized or coherent as it could have been. This 
offbeat extravaganza is now playing at the Fulton; for those like 
myself, who are intrigued by unusual technical gimmickry, this 
film is well worth seeing. After this movie, the coming James 
Bond film You Only Live Twice will seem like an anti-climax.

Editorial . . .
A Nero Miss
This year, Spring Carnival committee has gone a long 
way in an attempt to provide something for everyone at 
some time in the weekend. Even though it is fairly difficult 
to please the eitire student body all weekend, the commit
tee has come fairly close.
Both the concert and the Saturday night dance ap
pear to have been approached with more originality than 
has been evident in years past. Peter Nero is a versatile 
man, and his choice, whether approached critically, eco
nomically, or promotionallythe name fitting well with 
the themeseems to be a good one, when one considers 
the run-of-the-mill alternatives for the same price. Satur
day looks as though it will be a gem. With three moods to 
choose from, even the most selective Tech student should 
be able to find one which meets his fancy.
The only flaw in the weekend is the budget. Although 
the committee has done a commendable job by keeping al
most the same budget limitations as in the past while giv
ing the students better and broaded entertainment, the 
Tartan feel that the administration has not realized its 
responsibilities, either financial or supportive. It seems 
hypocritical for the adminstration to state that it supports 
activities while, at the same time, charging Carnival com
mittee $300 for security officers, roughly $400 (down 
from last year) for maintenance personnel, and not paying 
for the electricity necessary to run the midway, which 
amounts to around $400.
It is important to emphasize that Carnival does not 
receive a subsidy, either from government or the admin
istration. The money that would be saved by the adminis
trations realization that this is as important as Orienta
tion Week, Trustees meetings, or keeping the lights in 
Warner Hall burning until 4:30 each morning, would per
mit the committee to search for even better entertainment 
than has been secured this year.
The Tartan believes that, given the budget constraints 
and available talent, the Spring Carnival committee has 
produced excellent selections for both Friday and Satur
day evenings. We also feel that the administration should 
stop giving lip service to student weekend and should sup
port the by not charging the committees concerned for 
school-supplied services.
Wire Ahead
The campus scene has been, marred by the construction 
of rusted wire fences around several of the lawn areas. Al
though the bare areas created by pedestrians are admittedly, 
unsightly, the fences are patently ugly. The Tartan should 
like to suggest that a walk be constructed from the ForbesMorewood comer to Skibo, since that is the area most tread 
upon. In addition, trees should be planted along the walks, 
decreasing some of the unsightliness which a variety of 
architects have placed about the campus. The grassy areas 
give the campus a quiet, cohesive feeling. Let us not ruin 
that beauty by producing a replica of the Normandy beach
heads.

Student Questions 
Morality of Draft
Editor, The Tartan:
My thoughts on The Draft
On October 3, 1966 before 500 
persons in the Yale Law School 
auditorium, Lieut. General Lew
is B. Hershey, director of the 
Selective Service, was asked: 
What would he do if he were 
of draft age and found he would 
be forced to perform military 
acts he considered morally im
possible to support. General 
Hershey responded that in or
der to maintain your dignity, 
youd have to go to the peni
tentiary. Many years1 ago, this 
question of whether one owes 
an allegiance to principles high
er than ones country laws was 
also raised. Principle IV Nurenberg Principles as formulated 
by the International Law Com
mission states: The fact that 
a person acted pursuant to or
der of his government or of a 
superior does not relieve him 
from responsibility under inter
national law, provided a moral 
choice was in fact possible to 
him,.
Today, many young men, my
self included, are faced with a 
moral choice. We feel that our 
country is guilty of crimes 
against peace: waging an ag
gressive offensive war; war 
crime: devastation of public and 
private property, devastation not 
justified by military necessity; 
and crimes against humanity: 
murder, intentional or not, and 
other acts of brutality against 
civilian populations. Our moral 
choice involves participating in 
this experiment in extermina
tion which our country is carry
ing out or, as General Hershey 
suggested being imprisoned 
for not helping our country car
ry out its policy of genocide.
There is no justification for 
United States intervention in 
Vietnam. From a legalistic 
standpoint, United States inter
vention is illegal whether one 
bases his decision on the United 
Nations Charter, our SEATO 
commitment, the Geneva Ac
cord of 1954, or our own United 
States Constitution. (New York 
Times, January 15, 1967; Amer
ican Bar Association Journal 
July, 1966; Congressional Rec
ord, February 25, 1966, etc.)
As called for in our legal 
structure, the prosecutor must 
establish beyond any reasonable 
doubt that the person accused 
of a crime is, in fact, guilty. 
Execution, the extreme penalty, 
is the verdict in only a minority 
of the more brutal crimes in 
the United States. I do not be
lieve President Johnson and his 
administration has proved its 
case for mass execution beyond 
any reasonable doubt. One only 
has to note the disagreement 
among rational men over such 
a basic issue as: was the war 
a war of conquest by the South 
against the North, a civil war, 
or aggression by the North 
against the South? The credi
bility gap has consistently and 
rapidly increased noticeably be
ginning with the White Paper 
issued by the State Department 
in 1966 as the administration 
has tried to mislead the Amer
ican public.
From a moral standpoint, 
since I feel that we do not have 
a right to determine the destin
ies of the Vietnamese people 
and use them callously for our
own purposes, I feel that I 
should have the right to refuse 
to perform military acts of mur
der of innocent people without 
having to face five years of 
hard labor. I am conscientious
ly opposed to the Vietnam war. 
My Draft Board, however, if 
confronted with this situation, 
would not give me a Conscien
tious Objector classification for 
I do not profess my opposition 
on the basis of a Supreme Be
ing that I would not fight in 
any war. I am a conscientious 
objector to this war for politi
cal, philosophical, ethical, and 
legal reasons. It is ironic in a 
democracy such as the one we 
profess that this is not suffi
cient.
To practice what we preach, 
our principles of democracy 
must extend beyond our own 
country. Only then can mankind 
learn what we have learned 
about democracy. Only then can 
mankind live and work togeth
er. When only will all humanity 
benefit; trusting each other and 
helping one another. How else? 
It is for these reasons I would 
be ashamed at this time to wear 
my countrys uniform. It is for 
these reasons I feel I should 
have the right to refuse to act 
as an agent of execution for 
our government by burning 
and bombing the Vietnamese.
Michael Malakoff 
Senior, Industrial Management
Tech Students 
Lack Character
Editor, The Tartan:
Why the Apathy?
Evidence, to demonstrate the 
apathy and general lack of in
terest in things happening on 
and with this campus, is over
whelming.
Last year, after two games 
the football team showed that 
Tech had the best team in five 
years. Yet the stands at home 
games were not filled to capa
city and when Tech was be
hind, few cheered in encourage
ment. Student participation in 
campus politics, publications 
and clubs is very small. Student 
Congress has to nominate con
gressmen because there are not 
enough candidates, while other 
candidates run unopposed. Cam
pus publications are not run by 
people who are able and quali
fied but rather by those few, 
selected because they were 
available and express an inter
est. Interest alone however, is 
not sufficient when it comes to 
acting as the voice of the stu
dent body: discussing pressing 
issues and scrutinizing changes 
in admnistrative policies.
When plans for Warner Hall 
were announced, and during its 
errection, there was no organ
ized dissent from the student 
body.
Clubs, where only an interest 
is needed for participation are 
soon dissolved because of fad
ing interests. Tech students are 
apathetic to issues that concern 
them. They allow the adminis
tration to run all aspects of 
campus activities.
Several explanations for this 
apathy and lack of interest have 
offered. An officer of Student 
Government blames the lack of 
significant issues. This, coming 
from an officer only proves ig
norance and demonstrates that 
participation does not neces
sarily mean involvement and 
taking an active part.
Another more generally ac
cepted explanation is the lack 
of time because of the fulltime 
devotion to studying demanded 
by Tech curriculum. However, 
there are few specimens of book
worms on campus. The adminis
tration encourages certain out
side activities and makes an at
tempt to satisfy the needs of 
the students. Therefore there is 
no feasable explanation for the 
apathy on this campus.
The search for the solution 
leads to an analysis of the Tech 
students themselves. The Tech 
student reflects the admission 
policies of the administration. 
Entrance requirements to col
leges are: high school grades, 
scores on scholastic tests, extra 
curricular activities and inter
ests, and the recommendation of 
teachers. Tech admission stan 
dards place an emphasis on 
grades and disregard indication 
upon the applicants character. 
Whether grades reflect parental 
ambitions or personal motiva
tion could be determined by 
the students character. This is 
reflected in his interests and 
hobbies. But these signposts are 
disregarded. The result is that 
the incoming freshman is a con
scientious worker. That is all 
the administration knows about 
him and that is what the fresh
man is really like. But he is 
conscientious only in one thing: 
studying. Thus the average 
Tech student has no character, 
no personal values and no opin
ions which he is willing to de
fend. He is very practical and 
egocentric, extremely profes
sional minded and thus not very 
diverse. The lack of outside in
terests makes him an imperfect 
member of society and the com
munity because he can do only 
one thing. While he may get 
ahead in a community made up 
of people like him (Tech) he is 
destined to fail in the real 
world.
To remedy this condition 
there is a dire need to revise 
the admission practices of Tech. 
It is hoped that with the many 
changes resulting from the 
transition from Carnegie Insti
tute of Technology to Carnegie 
University, changes in admis
sion practices will come about. 
More emphasis should be placed 
on student character.

Student Criticizes 
Techs Segregation
Editor, The Tartan:
Although the administration, 
the faculty, and the student or
ganizations at Carnegie Tech all 
claim to be trying to change 
policies and practices (and some 
are trying), Carnegie Tech is 
presently a segregated school. 
At least four of the 12 fraterni
ties will not admit a Negro to 
membership (only three have 
ever been integrated); five of 
the seven sororities maintain 
similar membership criteria 
(only one of these has ever been 
desegregated). There are fewer 
than five Negro teachers (1.6 
per cent); no more than 30 Ne
gro undergraduates (.9 per 
cent); eight Negro secretaries 
(three per cent); and no Negro 
security police. Practically all 
maids and janitors are Negro.

The 1967 Sweepstakes, more commonly known as the buggy races, should prove to 
be the fastest in the 47 years of racing at Carnegie Tech. The earliest record was a 
2:43.0 by Kappa Sig in 1938, which was eventually lowered to the still existing course 
record of 2:25.0 set by ATO and its Andy I in 1956, and tied the next year by ATOs 
Golden Goose. Since 1957, the best time hasbeen recorded by BTPs OO with a 2:27.02 
in the last years preliminary heats.
1I1L.
Harvey pushes
Thus, for the past ten years, 
Techs best engineers and ath
letes have tried to circle the 
courses in less than 2:25, and, 
thus far, all attempts have fail
ed. In my opinion, 1967 will be 
the year for a new course rec
ord, not by just one buggy, but 
possibly by two or three.
This year, for the first time 
in history, the buggies have held 
organized, police protected, day
time practices. This drastic 
change from tradition was caus
ed by the ever increasing vol
ume of traffic in Schenley Park 
at night, which made it hazard
ous and very difficult to obtain 
favorable results in the wee 
hours of the morning.
With this innovation of day
time practices came a new open
ness to the races. Before every
thing was done in secret, and 
no one house knew what the 
others buggies looked like, or 
what times they were running. 
Now anyone with a stopwatch 
can come out on Sunday morn
ings and determine how his com
petition is doing or what design 
innovations it has added over 
the winter.
This year the first excitement 
about the races was raised when 
ATOs new buggy came onto the 
course with what some buggy 
chairmen described as wierd 
black boxes on the rear wheels 
with wires connected to whoknows-what inside. ATO has 
been, and will continue to be, 
the target of much questioning, 
with their mysterious use of the 
power pole and their last second 
appearances on the starting line.
Then came the appearance of 
BSR with its radical three wheel 
buggy, the Dolphin, unanimous
ly agreed to be the fastest freeroller and a contender if it ever 
could make the turn! Unfor
tunately, at the last Sunday 
practice session on April 30, 
Beta Sig hit a hole in the street 
near the Westinghouse Pond 
and broke its rear axle, thus 
making it very difficult for them 
to race on Friday, although I 
am sure Julian Hofberg and 
his courageous buggy men will 
make an all out effort to fix the 
Dolphin and have it ready to 
race in time.
Last years finalists, BTP, ATO, 
and PiKA, who had times of 
2:27.02, 2:29.74, and 2:29.40, re
spectively, all have to be serious 
contenders for the trophy. Beta, 
the winner for the last two 
years, has most of its pushers 
back with Don Keefer and Ray 
Burdett, unbeatable on one and 
two, as well as sprinters Bob 
Livengood and Jeff Sheldon for 
the back hills. Curiously enough, 
Beta has run only two full 
courses in the practice sessions, 
with times of about 2:43. These 
trials were without all of its 
best pushers, however, and Im 
sure that on raceday the men of 
BTP will once again be battling 
for the best times.
ATO, the course record hold
er, has a new buggy joining the 
Goose for Sweepstakes laurels. 
In the last 14 years ATO has 
taken nine firsts, three seconds, 
and one third, and along with 
PiKa who in the last 20 years
has been in the finals 17 times 
with two firsts, seven seconds, 
and eight thirds, has the winningest tradition on campus. The 
Goose has run a 2:37 in practice 
this year, and should cut this 
down to at least 2:30 on race
day. Judging from its perform
ance. in the practice session with 
a 2:30 time and from its push
ers experience, PiKas SharW 
has to be this years favorite to 
win the races.
The surprise of the entire year 
and very possibly this years 
winner could be Phi Kappa Thetas Shamrock. A third place 
finisher in 1959 with a 2:32.5, 
and another third in 1964 with 
a 2:37.7, Phi Kap had 2:38.89 for 
its best time last year. But with 
the excellent work of Buggy 
Chairmen Larry Moran, Ray LeClair, and hill two pusher Ken 
Gianni among others, the Phi 
Kap entry recorded consecutive 
times of 2:31, 2:32, and a 2:29 
in last Sundays practice session, 
all of which put Phi Kap near 
the top of contenders for this 
years races. The only thing lack
ing for them is a bit of experi
ence which they would be happy 
to gain while breaking the course 
record.
Other contenders are TDP, 
who finished fourth last year 
tut had the second best time of 
anyone. Tau Delta, who, along 
with SAE, races the unconven
tional bike, which is slower on 
the free roll but is an ease to 
push, has an experienced push 
team and, if the weather condi
tions are perfect, can be a seri
ous threat. TDP's best time in 
the practice sessions was a 2:37, 
which must be substantially im
proved if it hopes to be a connew SW buggy.
tender. SAE, which has taken 
two seconds, two thirds, a fourth, 
and a fifth since 1961, has been 
covering up some secret on the 
bike, and with good weather, 
could also be a challenger.
Sigma Nu, which had a 2:30 
for a second place finish in 1959 
with its Coffin, has a new 
buggy which has taken over the 
number one spot from the beau
tiful, but heavy Lizard. The 
new buggys time of 2:38.5 in 
the practice sessions is better 
than any other in eight years, 
and with some last minute mir
acles from Chairman Bob Summerfeldt it could be racing on 
Saturday.
The dorms, with a second 
place in 1960, TX, and DTD all 
appear to be a year or two 
away from serious contention. 
Kappa Sig has had trouble get
ting its buggy together, and 
since it has not been at any 
practice sessions, will probably 
not be racing this year. DU, 
with a new buggy and fresh 
ideas, could do very well for a 
first year buggy,for their practime of 2:52 was better than 
their six times of last year.
I have been proud to be a part 
of such a grand tradition as the 
Carnegie Tech Sweepstakes. Un
countable man hours and ex
penses have gone into the 
thought and design of each bug
gy, and the hard work of an en
tire year is threatened by the 
omnipresent Frew Street turn. 
I wish all the buggy chair
men good luck on raceday, and 
a tremendous amount of thanks 
for their exceptional patience 
during the many hours of trials 
and tribulations during the year.

CARNIVALEXTRA
Tomorrow evening at 5:00, 
Spring Carnival, 1967, will be
gin its official 58 hour exist
ence. Dr. and Mrs. Stever will 
be present to crown the Queen 
of Spring Carnival and to 
help open the gateway to a 
weekend of Roman Thru the 
Comics.
(Began in 1920)
The Spring Weekend first ap
peared at Tech in 1920 as an en
tertainment for returning 
alums. The undergraduates be
came so involved in the festiv
ities in the ensuing years that 
the administration banned the 
festival in 1929 ( a good year 
for everyone). In 1930, through 
a petition, the weekend was 
reinstated and took its present 
name.
There were Coronation Balls 
on Thursday, Costume Balls on 
Friday, canoe tilts, roller skat
ing, musical reviews, Formal 
Dances on Saturday night and 
buggies and booths of all shapes 
and sizes.
Roman Thru . . .
In addition to three amuse
ment rides, a concession stand 
and live broadcasting by 
WRCT, the Carnival goer will 
have 21 booths to visit on the 
expanded 1967 Midway. This 
year the YMCA as well as the 
12 fraternities, seven soror
ities and Mens Dorm Council 
are teaming up to make Ro
man thru the Midway more 
exciting than ever.
(Three New Buggies)
After one Saturday and six 
Sunday mornings of free roll 
practice, more hours on mid
night push practice, and many 
more hours of designing, build
ing and rebuilding, 23 buggies 
will compete in the 1967 Sweep
stakes. These will include new 
entries from ATO, DU and Sig
ma Nu.
(Johnson speaks at Call Day) 
At Call Day, the Tech honoraries, governing bodies and 
other societies will honor out
standing students through 
awards and calls to member
ship. Mr. Johnson, Techs new 
vice-president for planning will 
speak.
Some of the organizations to 
be represented are the activ
ities and leadership honoraries. 
Omicron Delta Kappa, Mortar 
Board, Delta Skull, Phi Tau 
Gamma, Scimitars and Owens. 
Phi Kappa Phi and Tau Beta 
Pi will honor outstanding 
scholarship and professional 
promise. Panhellenic Council 
and AWS will be represented, 
as well as the Activities Com
mittee of Student Senate which 
will present the 1967 activities 
keys. Pi Delta Epsilon will call 
people who have distinguished 
themselves in campus publica
tions. The A1 Cerrito Award to 
the outstanding senior basket
ball player will be presented by 
Alpha Tau Omega. (Others 
wishing to be represented at 
Call Day should contact Bill Patula at 461-9703).
The Womens Club and the 
Pittsburgh Womens Clan will 
present scholarship awards. The 
Vera Heinz Award, new this 
year, is to a junior woman for 
summer study in Europe.
(Let Them Eat Grapes)
The ballroom, faculty din
ing room and snack bar will 
be the scene of the last offi
cial fling of Spring Carnival, 
1967. Lots of great music 
(Richard Maltby, The Ithicas, 
The Harvey Lord Quintet,

Design Contest 
Draws 12 Entries
An important part of the sweepstakes takes place even be
fore the race is run; buggy teams spend months preparing their 
entries for the design competition. Held early Friday morning 
before the preliminary heats of the race, design judging is a cri
tical evaluation of engineering and construction of each buggy. 
Design awards are as coveted as race trophies.
At about 7 am the teams carry their buggies to the display 
area behind Tech Bowl. By now each part of each buggy has 
been polished to a mirror-like smooth finish. The bodies receive 
perhaps 20 coats of hand-rubbed lacquer and nearly as many of 
war. They stand gleaming in the early morning sunlight. Teams 
often set up elaborate displays with charts explaining design fea
tures; sometimes cloth backdrops are used to set off the color 
scheme of the buggy.
When all entries are in position, the five judges begin their 
evaluation. Two of the five are chosen from Techu campus and are 
usually eminent engineers or industrial designers. The remaining 
three are guest judges and may include automotive engineers and 
stylists imported from Detroit or well known figures in auto racing.
After this perusal, the buggies are taken one at a time into 
the Tech Bowl, where each buggy chairman has five minutes to 
explain the intricacies of his buggy to the five judges. Each entry 
is evaluated on the basis of 100 points: 25 for ingenuity of engi
neering, 25 for soundness of construction, ten for workmanship, 
five for human engineering, and 25 for esthetics (general appear
ance). The s<?ore of each entry is the sum of the five scores from 
each judge. Last years winner was BTP with 405/500, second 
was SN with 396/500, and third was ATO with 384/500.
To be eligible for a design trophy, a buggy must compete in 
the preliminary heats without design failure or infractions of the 
race rules and must finish in the top half of the entries. The fastest 
buggy is by no means the one with the best theoretical design, for 
there is a great difference between the drawing board and Schenley Drive. To my knowledge, last years first by BTP in sweep
stakes and design was the first in buggy history.
I would like to thank Design Chairman R. Peter Heinkel for 
his long hours of working and making the design phase of Sweep
stakes 67 a success.

pin. Normally its used for cater
ed meals.
Another improvement 
scheme, which has been aproved, is the transformation 
of the Snack Bar lower level 
into a furnished coffee house 
or restaurant. This will con
trast the spacious, exposed at
mosphere of the Snack Bar 
proper, by producing a more 
private expensive atmos
phere using partitions, car
peting, and new furniture. 
(The furniture, according to 
James Sands, school purchas
ing agent, is due May 1.) In 
the same section of the snack 
bar, toward the far end, is 
planned a public T.V. room 
using bleachers, In place of 
more conventional furniture, 
to increase seating. Carpeting 
on both the floor and the 
bleachers, to increase comfort, 
is also promised.
These plans for the lower 
level Snack Bar should mater
ialize during the next school 
year. Another plan for the im
mediate future involves the 
cafeteria downstairs. Originally 
plans were for a large partition 
to divide contract line from 
non-contract line; this would 
prevent use of the entire din
ing area, so it was rejected. In 
its place a new plan has been 
proposed by food services, which 
includes the purchase of all 
new dining equipmentcollap
sable tables and chairs. This
should encourage more effective 
use of space in Skibo and make 
the building more suitable for 
student use.
Commenting on Student 
Union Committee, former mem
ber and new Vice-President of 
Student Congress Tom Moore 
had nothing but praise for the 
gains made and new plans pro
posed by the Student Union 
Committee. He seems to concur on the general inadequacy 
of Skibo and feels that new 
plans will make the best use of 
what is available. He feels more 
recreational facilities are need
ed such as table tennis, pool 
and bowling. The idea of con
structing bowling alleys in Ski
bo has been considered and if 
space can be found this is a 
possibility.
It's trade-in time fox tired old myths.
Like the one about business. Especially 
big business. That it is beyond the rugged 
individualists wildest daydream to enter 
this holy of holies because hell lose some
thing thats very sacred like his inde
pendence.
Sure, it can happen. If a guy or gal 
wants to hide, or just get by, or not accept 
responsibility, or challenges.
Were not omniscient enough or stupid 
enough to speak for all business, but at a 
company like Western Electric, bright 
ideas are not only welcome, they are en
couraged. And no door is shut. Create a 
little stir, go ahead, upset an old apple
cart (we replace shibboleths at a terrific 
pace  we have to as manufacturing and 
supply unit of the Bell System  in order 
to provide your Bell telephone company 
with equipment it needs to serve you.)
Theres an excitement in business. True, 
were in it to make a profit, but working to
find new and better ways to make things 
that help people communicate is very re
warding and satisfying. Did you ever hear 
these wry words of Oliver Wendell 
Holmes? Never trust a generality  not 
even this one.
Thats how we feel about the generality 
that claims youll just become a little cog 
in a company like Western Electric. You 
might, of course, but if you consider your
self an individual now, odds are 10 to 1 
that youll keep your individuality. And 
cherish it. And watch it grow. Even at big, 
big Western Electric.
You know, thats the only way wed 
want you to feel. If you feel like coming 
in with us.

Track Team Splits Pair
fill's -
by Ron Finnin
The Carnegie Tech track team now stands 5-3 after one win and one loss in the past 
week. The loss occurred at the hands of a surprisingly tough Allegheny College team last 
Wednesday on the Tech field. Many athletes turned in their best performances of the 
yearyet they were not good enough to take first place against Allegheny, who took 
first place in fourteen out of seventeen events, losing only the three distance races.
Allegheny 89Tech 56
Tech 75W& J 70
Then, on Saturday Tech tra
veled to W&J to pull a victory 
cut of the tighest meet of the 
season, as CIT edged past the 
home team 75-70. This was the 
first meet of the season that 
Techwon on seconds and thirds 
as the Tartans took only seven 
of 17 firsts, but came back with 
11 of 15 seconds and seven of 
15 thirds. The meet showed 
some of the closest competition 
of the year and almost every 
event wasfought down to the 
wire but Tech came through 
under pressure, and the result 
was a narrow victory.
Some points of interest in the 
two meets were: 1). Steve Aylor finally broke 20 feet in the 
broad iump against Allegheny, 
only to take second place. 2).
Ken Happach cleared six feet 
in the high jumpat W&J, but 
this was only good for second.
3). Tech swept the four yard in 
termediate hurdles at W&J as 
Jim Brezovec lowered his own

record to 59.8 and Howie Illian, 
running hurdles for the 11th 
time this year, took third place. 
4). W&J won the half mile 
with a time of 2:03.1, with Bernie Flynn just inches behind, 
and Tech lost its first distance 
race of the year.
Techs last home meet is to
day as the Tartans play host 
to Bethany College of Bethany, 
W. Va. Tech then closes the 
season next Wednesday as they 
travel to Grove City to meet 
their toughest opponent of the 
season.

uate school does not alter the 
nature of the undergraduate 
lum. The proposed by Dean Cyert would create top-ranking stu
dents who will have no trouble 
entering graduate school or 
inobtaining a job after four 
years in school.
Dean Cyerts proposals are 
based on the belief that first 
rate education can be provided 
by the University but the real
ization of this plan cannot be 
done from a standing start.
It would be premature to at
tempt any predictions on the 
University at this time. Both

sideration the issue of available

(Continued from Page 1)
pessimistic view at the future 
of H&SS mainly because of 
the limitations placed upon 
its realization by the size and 
financial resources of Tech.
Dean Cyert proposes an ex
periment program to start in 
the fall of 1967 with 50 fresh
men on a double major pro
gram. The double major pro
gram would be in some engi
neering field and a branch of 
social science or humanities. 
This would involve the reduc
tion of some required engineer
ing courses compensated by 
more courses in the second major. This experiment would be 
continued for three to five years 
at which point the experience 
gained and the increase in the 
number of faculty and facilities 
necessary for a competitive uni
versity, will be attained. The 
nature of a College of Liberal 
Arts is one having a curriculum 
that will train students to be 
citizens who can actively par
ticipate in the policy discussion 
relevant to their society and 
who can function effectively in 
the world. Therefore Dean Cy
ert proposes a curriculum that 
emphasizes both social sciences 
and engineering. This curricu
lum vfould develop individuals 
who will understand the prob
lem facing them and will have 
available the techniques neces
sary to solve that problem. The

Netters Win Two 
Record Now 6-1
by Michael Smolens
The Carnegie Tech tennis team travelled to Beaver 
Falls, Pa., last Wednesday to defeat Geneva College 6-3. 
This win increased their record to 5-1, with 5 matches re
maining. Playing before a highly partisan home crowd, the 
Tartans split the singles matches, with reliable Salim Khan 
(T) winning easily over Bob Clark (G) 6-0, 6-1. At second 
singles, Marc Walthers (G) defeated Bob Lowe (T) in a 
hard fought match 7-5, 1-6, 7-5. A1 Marcus (G) defeated 
Leigh Dehuff (T) 6-4, 6-0. Dick Londergan, the Tartans 
regular number three player, injured his back in the warm 
ups and was forced to sit out the entire match. In fourth 
singles, George Henning (G) edged out Mike Smolens (T) 
9-7, 9-7, Joe Gordon (T) won easily over A1 Foreman (G) 
6-4, 6-3, and Randy Wright (T), playing in his first singles 
match, won over Rich Gratton (G) 6-3, 2-6, 6-3.
In the doubles, the netters  " 1 ....... -
once again showed their experi
ence and depth by sweeping all 
three doubles matches for the 
fourth time. Khan and Gordon 
won over Clark and Walthers,
6-3, 1-6, 6-1; Lowe and Smolens 
won-easily, 64, 62; and DeHuff 
and Wright won, 6-2, 6-3.
Against Allegheny, the Tar
tans won, 8-1, before a large 
Tech home crowd of about 40.
After not having played for Al
legheny for the last four years 
due to inclement weather, the 
netters quickly took charge by 
sweeping the singles matches.
Khan played his toughest oppon
ent thus far, Bill Toll (A) [who 
had lost to Bethanys tennis ace 
Kirk Hunter by a 13-11 score in 
the third set]. Kahn, serving, 
stroking, and volleying flawless, 
defeated Toll, 6-2, 6-1. This sets 
up the dual between Khan and 
Hunter as the mythical tri-state 
intercollegiate tennis champion
ship. Lowe won at second sin
gles over Chuck Areson (A),
6-4, 6-3; Londergan, still slight
ly suffering from his weak back 
from a week back, won over Bill 
Kammann (A) 7-5, 6-3; Gordon 
won over Jim Mahoney (A), 7-5,
6-2; Gleen Gilbert, who earned 
a singles berth by his excellent 
play the past week, won over 
Bob Wilson (A), 7-5, 6-2; and 
Smolens won over Bill Ostran
der (A), 6-3, 6-2.
With a new combination at 
first doubles, Khan and Gilbert
Gordon Returns a Serve.
appeared exceptionally strong as 
they wiped out Toll and Areson 
(A), 6-1, 6-1. At second doubles, 
Lowe and Smolens lost the first 
set, 6-2, but came back strong 
and won in three sets, 2-6, 6-4, 
6-3, to remain undefeated for 
the year. At third doubles, 
Wright and DeHuff were upset 
by Kammann and Ralph Tener 
(A), 6-3, 6-2.
With these two victories, the 
Tartan netmen stand at 6-1 for 
the season. The next match is 
May 8 at St. Francis, and then 
May 10th at home against West
minster. The Bethany match will 
be played sometime after the 
Westminster match. Up to date, 
Kahn leads the team with a 
record of 12-1; next comes Lowe, 
Smolens, and Gordon with 11-2; 
Wright and Hicken are 5-1; Lon
dergan 8-2, Gilbert, 3-1; and 
Kammann (A), 7-5, 6-3; Gordon 
dergan, 8-2; Gilbert, 3-1; and 
DeHuff, 4-3.

signed to accuse the administra
tion, the faculty, or the student 
organizations of conscious and 
deliberate racism. All concern
ed are certainly too mature and 
intelligent to see racism as jus
tified or to be consciously per
petuated There is potential to 
change Techs white campus, but 
why bother? Negro students are 
able to attend colleges and uni
versities of equal or greater 
rank than Carnegie Tech. They 
are not being irreparably in
jured by the whiteness of this 
campus. The people who are 
damaged are the white students 
and faculty.
The white student at Tech is 
getting an inferior education. 
He is protected by the ivory 
tower from confronting one of 
the most serious issues that this 
country has ever faced. The 
problem is not the relatively 
simple one of civil rights, but 
rather mans relationship to his 
fellow manhuman rights. A 
segregated environment deprives 
a student of the feedback he 
needs to examine his values and 
prejudices. The more a person 
knows of himself, the more cap
able he is of integrating into the 
American community. A student 
should realize he is being short
changed.
Moreover, a student bringing 
a little innocent bigotry from 
home can have his prejudices 
reinforced and strengthened. 
Many freshmen, without having 
defined their own attitudes about 
racial issues, join various cli
ques or Greeks where racial dis
crimination is practiced almost 
unconsciously, as a way of life. 
A person searching for security 
finds it in his acceptance by a 
group; this acceptance is often 
contingent on his own adoption 
of the groups attitudes and prej
udices. Although racism and big
otry are not primary reasons 
for the drawing together of 
these groups, they are frequent
ly unavoidable by-products of 
the quest for security and ac
ceptance.
The faculty, like the students, 
are insulated in the academic 
world where the problems of the 
real world may never appear. 
There is little opportunity to 
challenge or even examine their 
own attitudes toward Negroes. 
The existing heavy work-loads 
testify to their professional dedi
cation but do not excuse the 
apathy toward the racial imbal
ance of the campus. They can 
be sympathetic toward the civil 
rights movement, but their sym
pathy is detached because they 
are not in contact with the prob
lem. I contend that no person, 
particularly in education, should 
cease to learn and to accept 
challenges on basic personal and 
social issues. Once a person be
comes content with himself and 
his environment, he is of no use 
to an educational community. 
His complacency about human 
rights can easily lead to a dull 
mind which is ultimately com
municated to his students. The 
faculty's lack of concern perpet
uates the student's inferior edu
cation, reinforces racist patterns, 
and accelerates drifting out of 
the real world into an academic 
never-never land.
No critique of Carnegie Tech 
can be complete without a brief 
declaration of apathy. Apathy 
is present and persistent. Too 
many students and faculty come 
to Tech energetic, fall into the 
white campus syndrome, and 
dont even notice their own apa
thy until long after graduation. 
Those active students usually 
leave Carnegie Tech in a very 
short time. It is very difficult to 
integrate acting people into an 
inactive, unconcerned commun
ity. And it is even more difficult 
to activiate a dormant commun
ity without active leaders. Ra
cism exists because the students 
and faculty allow it to exist, 
however inadevertently. Student 
and faculty motivation for ac
tion will not follow until these 
people recognize the undesirabil
ity of the present situation and 
its negative contribution to their 
educational experience.

members one would expect to >. 
be able to put together a pro
gram especially tailored for 
Cernegie Tech students on so 
pressing an issue as the Viet 
Nam War without having to 
draw on outside speakers, be 
they politicians or academics 
from other Pittsburgh univers
ities.
Second, the attempt to find a 
speaker from among the Car^ 
negie Tech faculty was limited 
too: it was not an exhaustive 
search. Though the Military Sci
ence Department was approach
ed, and the Young Americans 
for Freedom made some efforts 
to find speakers before declin
ing to co-sponsor the event, not 
every faculty member was in
dividually approached. Since our \ 
Constitution guarantees a right 
of responsible assent as surely 
as it guarantees a right of re 
sponsible dissent, I should like 
to use this opportunity to in
vite any faculty member at Car
negie Tech who is prepared to 
defend U.S. policy in Vietnam 
in a public forum to contact me.

VN Panel Members 
Not Chosen Fairly
Editor, The Tartan:
In a recent Tartan article, 
Tech Profs. Examine Wars 
Many Effects, there appears a 
quotation to which I should 
like to respond. First the quo
tation:
George Baylor, the panels 
moderator, when asked why 
the panel appeared to be load
ed with people who opposed 
the war, pointed out that a 
sincere attempt had been 
made to obtain a speaker 
whose position was more in 
accord with that of U.S. poli
cy, but that no one was will
ing to speak, and that al
though the Young Americans 
for Freedom were invited to 
co-sponsor the event, they de
clined to do so. Carnegie 
Tech Tartan, April 12, 1967, 
p. 5).
The quotation is factually 
correct. It contains two errors 
of omission, however, that seem 
to me to obscure the whole 
story. First, the attempt, to 
obtain a speaker whose position 
was more in accord with that 
of U.S. policy was a very lim
ited attempt: it was limited to 
faculty members of Carnegie 
Tech, and for a couple of rea
sons. One had to do with the 
level of intellectual discourse 
that the planners of the pro
gram wanted to maintain in an 
educational environment  we 
all remembered a debate from 
the previous year that Carnegie 
Techs Young Republicans had 
sponsored in which an out
sider (a man running in a Re
publican primary for Congress) 
had seemed to many of us to 
violate some generally accepted 
rules of academic discussion 
and debate. A second reason 
had to do with our own paro
chial attitudes about our aca
demic excellence. Surely from 
a fulltime faculty of over 400
Producer Corrects 
Film Publicity
Editor, the Tartan:
I really appreciate the first 
publicity for our forthcoming 
film Come Back Baby, that we ^ 
received in last weeks issue. It 
is, however, a most complex 
creation, and mistakes were 
bound to be made in any exten
sive report on the film. Your 
rate of accuracy was admir
ably high but I must make pub
lic these corrections.
Craig Bovia, not Rick Larson, 
plays the important part of 
Stoney. It is Stoney who tries 
to ravish the high school girl 
(Colette Bablon), not Cal (John 
Terry Riebling) as your article 
states. Rick Larson was too 
busy with endless work in the 
Drama Department to take part 
in the film. Bovia turned out to 
be one of the most magnificent 
substitutes imaginable. His deep) 
and stormy portrayal of an icy, 
nearly psychopathic character 
seriously threatens to steal 
away the whole show.
Our budget was reported to 
be $3,000.00; this was the 
correct estimate a week ago, 
but now we soar to new heights. 
No final figure can be arrived 
at just now. Finally, I was misj 
quoted in saying that as far as 
I know, no American college 
undergraduates have ever pro
duced a film of this length. Im 
sure its happened before 
though I doubt often.
Many thanks for your article. 
We have high hopes that this 
immense enterprise will live up 
to your generous treatment of

P. S. Mr. Midani, the Drama
