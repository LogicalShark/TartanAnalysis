Mens Dormitory Council 
Reactivated on Campus
The Mens Dormitory Council will be reactivated at meetings being 
held this week in each of the Mens Dormitories. Nominations will be 
made for dormitory offices as well as for the Council, with elections to 
be held next week. The Council will consist of the President of each 
dormitory and a representative of each class from each dormitory. Mr. 
Frank Eyman, Head of the Mens Dormitories, will be, as in former 
years, the Treasurer of the Council as well as its advisor. The Council 
will function as a medium through which the dormitory residents will 
be able to participate in social activities and sports, and it will exer
cise a degree of disciplinary action upon the occasion of water-fights 
and other general misdemeanors.
Before Christmas, a committee of three former members of the 
Mens Dormitory Council, Bob Brill, George Maley, and BUI Mast, was 
appointed with Dr. Wardens approval to investigate the possibilities 
of reactivating the Council. Inas------------------------------------------------------
much as three of the five Mens 
Dormitories were to be occupied 
this Semester, it was decided that 
a meeting of the dormitories 
should decide the future of the 
Council. This meeting was held 
on January 11, 1946, and the resi
dents decided, almost unanimous
ly, that the Council should be
come active again.
The Mens Dormitory Council 
has been in the past an active 
participant in all campus activi
ties. Two of the major events on 
the social calendar of the school 
year were the Fall and Spring 
Dances sponsored by the Council. 
Claymore Clan is an organization 
within the Council especially cre
ated to handle the major social 
events of the Council.
Another of the activities of the 
dormitory residents was the pub
lication of the Dorm Bagpiper. 
This paper was published jointly 
by the men and women residents 
of the dormitories and contained 
only news of interest to the dorm 
residents. Since the Mens Dor
mitory Council again is to be ac
tive, considerable interest has 
been elicited among the men. All 
that is needed for the revival of 
the Dorm Bagpiper is an inter
ested group of women dorm resi
dents . . . and a lot of work.
Mens Glee Club 
Sings for Vets
The Mens Glee Club enter
tained the 850 patients at the Vet
erans Hospital in Aspinwall last 
Sunday, February 3, by singing at 
their evening chapel service. The 
Glee Club began the service at 
6:30 with the singing of some old 
hymns with the veterans. The 
hymns included such favorites as 
Come Thou Almighty King and 
The Old Rugged Cross. After the 
singing of the hymns, the Glee 
Club sang four songs: Divine 
Praise, The Lords Prayer, 
Hark the Vesper Hymn Is Steal
ing, and Prayer of Thanksgiv
ing.
The songs of the Glee Club were 
broadcast throughout the rooms 
of the hospital so that all the vet
erans could hear them. An indica
tion that the performance was sat
isfactory came when H. W. Peter
son invited the club to sing at the 
GAR Home in Homewood.
The Glee Club invites the men 
who are entering this semester to 
try out for the Club or for the job 
of accompanist. The Club meets 
every Monday and Wednesday at 
4:30 in 104 Margaret Morrison.
Former Techite Sets Speed Record 
As Leader of Jet Plane Flight
On January 26th. Col. William
H. Councill, a Tech graduate 
(E 33), broke the non-stop trans
continental speed record. Colonel 
Councill commanded the flight of 
three jet-propelled planes which 
made the record-breaking journey. 
He piloted the one plane which 
flew at the average rate of 585 
miles per hour from Long Beach, 
Calif., to LaGuardia Field, New 
York, in 4 hours, 13 minutes, and 
25 seconds.
William Councill of Ingomar 
knew what he wanted. While ma
joring in Mechanical Engineering, 
he was also an eager ROTC stu
dent and was active in Scabbard 
and Blade, a military honorary. 
He demonstrated his organization
al ability as co-chairman of the 
military ball. Immediately after 
graduation, Councill enlisted in 
toe Army Air Forces, to which he 
still belongs.
Colonel Councill not only served 
in North Africa but also in the 
South Pacific. He commanded a 
fighter group on Guadalcanal and 
is credited with leading a flight 
that killed 200 to 300 Japs on a 
Bougainville airfield.
Atom Bomb Associate 
Leads IRC Meeeting
Tomorrow at four oclock in 
Margaret Morrison, the Interna
tional Relations Club will hold its 
Aguiar discussion meeting. The 
featured speaker will be Dr. Estertoann, who will lead a discussion 
n The ^.Social Aspects of the 
Atomic Bomb. Mr. Estermann is 
an authority on the subject, since 
has been associated with the 
development of the A-Bomb since 
the beginning of the Manhatten
project.
Delta Skull and Scimitar Members 
Are Selected by Student Council
Interviewed after his recordbreaking flight on Saturday, Col
onel Councill predicted that jetpropelled planes will make fourhour trips across the country 
every-day occurrences. He used 
an oxygen mask throughout the 
flight, which was made at an alti
tude of 40,000 feet. Colonel Coun
cill says that his plane, Shooting 
Star, reached a maximum speed 
of 700 miles per hour between 
Akron and New Yorkalmost the 
speed of sound. The two other 
jet-propelled planes accompanying 
him were forced down for fuel 
and arrived in New York later.
At Tech, Councill belonged to 
Delta Upsilon Fraternity. He now 
lives with his wife and daughter 
near his base at Wright Field, Day
ton, Ohio.
ATO House Occupied 
By Weary Beta Sigs
Have you walked cast Forbes 
and Morewood recently and no
ticed a light in the former ATO 
House? If you have, you werent 
just seeing things because the Beta 
Sigs have moved in. After the 
ATOs left in 1943, the army and 
then the navy occupied the house, 
and only since,. November, 1944, 
has the house been empty.
The Beta Sigs meanwhile have 
had quite a conglomeration of 
dwellings. They have lived in 
their old house opposite the ATO 
house, Hawthorn hall, The Pitt Pi 
Lam house, the Tech SAE house, 
Boss Hall, Welch Hall, and now 
finally the ATO house.
This new house presents at 
least a temporary solution to their 
housing problem, and everyone 
wishes them the best of luck in 
this new dwelling.

THE CARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY, FEBRUARY 5, 19 t6
Editors Armchair
Something New Has Been Added
Youre not a very big class, it is true, but youre an 
important one, for you are the men who will play a large part 
in molding the future of Carnegie Tech. We want to welcome 
you and to tell you a little about the life and the traditions of 
the college to which you have come.
Carnegie is rather young as institutions of higher learning 
go. In its short lifetime it has not had time to acquire as many 
hoary traditions as can be found at Yale and Harvard. We do 
have, however, a few reasonably ancient customs which are 
being revived this year. First, there are Freshman Regulations, 
to which you will not be subjected, since we thought most 
veterans would prefer not to wear those gay little plaid things. 
During the normal Regulations period in the fall, the freshman 
girls wear silly little hats with tassels; the boys, dinks and 
plaid ties which are supposed to look scotchand do amaz
ingly. Violators of Frosh rules must all do something foolish 
on Freshman Fun Night, an all-campus get-together which is 
held after the kiddies have passed their traditions exams. Then 
there is the Senior Fence on which only the high and mighty 
fourth-termers can sit, and the Senior Walk on which only they 
may tread. Our most enjoyable tradition is that wonderful 
Pep Rally we used to have every year before the Pitt-Tech 
football game. You know, of course, that weve all been 
conscientiously hating Pitt for years and years. We also have 
a few little interdepartmental feuds that have been buzzing 
around campus for ages. It seems that both the engineers and 
the Maggie Murphs spend most of their spare time looking 
down their noses at the madmen from Fine Arts, and the 
Fine Arts students consume hours by pointedly ignoring the 
stupid engineers. Traditionally, too, the engineers are always 
bitter about the slacks the Fine Arts girls wear, and the Fine 
Arts girls are bitter about the engineers being bitter about 
their slacks.
Human After All
The People from Pitt think we do nothing around here 
but study, talk nothing but study, and eat and sleep only when 
we can find absolutely nothing more to study. It is true that 
the outside work required by the profs at Tech is considerably 
more time-consuming than that demanded by other schools, 
but we do manage to have quite a bit of extra-curricular fun 
nevertheless. For those of you who are interested in writing or 
typing or cartooning, we have four publications, all of which 
are crying for help from you. For the athletically inclined, we 
have varsity basketball and swimming, plus thousands of 
intramural sports. For the intellectual we have a chess club 
yearning to be revived, and an International Relations Club 
which boasts members who hail from India, China, Spain, and 
Colombia. There are dances in droves, and theres always 
bridge in Skibo for those who want to while away a stray 
social hour.
Mrs. Anthony ...
Now we come to the advice department. We feel that our 
gray hairs acquired in the weeks before the last finals qualify 
us to state that it is an excellent idea not to get behind in the 
homework. Once we might have told you that if you get a 
good factor the first few semesters, you can slide on your 
reputation for the last two years, but last semester we tried 
sliding and ended up in the ditch. We realize that to you vets 
who have been all over the place and seen lots of very different 
things, campus life will seem very infantile, and campus extra
curricular activities extremely useless. But if you dont have 
to work outside of class, and if you dont know anyone in 
town to go out and be gay with, you will find yoil will enjoy 
the relaxation, the change of atmosphere, and the new friends 
you will make by coming out for sports or publications or one 
of the many other campus activities.
Good luck and good factors to you!

Above the entrance to the bean
ery stand some beautiful metal
lic letters spelling the word SKI
BO. To Techites, old and new, 
Skibo has always had a peculiar 
significance.
The history of Skibo (pro
nounced Skeebo by the Scots 
but not by the Techites) dates back 
to the ancestors of Andrew Car
negie who built a many-towered 
pcastle called Skibo. They named 
their castle from some popular 
Scottish legend. This was Carne
gies home before he crossed the 
ocean for America and eventually 
founded Carnegie Tech where the 
name Skibo has been trans
planted. ^
The history of Skibo on cam
pus involves three buildings which 
have borne that name. The first 
and second of these three are no 
longer; gravel and1 dirt, scars of 
their destruction, are all that re
man of Techs previous Skibos. 
During World War I, an incon
spicuous little tool shed arose in 
back of the gym on Margaret 
Morrison Street. This tool shed 
was destined to become Skibo 
No. 1; for, after the war, a soda 
fountain and booths replaced tools 
and equipment. Students, who 
flocked to this cozy retreat for a 
hand of bridge or a banana split, 
christened it Skibo. And Ski
bo it stayed till World War II 
drafted its management and re
painted its white and black trim
med frame in the armys olive 
drab. This reconverted tool shed 
became a clip joint where 
G. I.s got trimmed by scissorhappy barbers.
Techites deprived of a cozy re
treat for a hand of bridge or a 
bane wandered listlessly
Tecvets Sponsor 
All-Veteran Dance
Vets! Dont forget that all 
important date, February 8! 
Its the all-veterans informal 
dance at the Schenley Hotel 
to be given from 9 till 1 with 
Bill Le Roy and his: orchestra. 
Veterans will be admitted by 
invitation only.
Everyones looking forward 
to this dance, the first big so
cial function of its kind on the 
Tech campus. Its purpose is 
to help get the new veterans 
acquainted.
However, some of the girls 
are wondering how the new 
fellows will arrange dates 
since this affair comes so soon 
after registration. Well, here's 
the answerthe Tecvets are 
hoping for the cooperation of 
the girls sororities and dorms 
in providing dates. This is 
your chance to meet some of 
those sharp vets youve 
been eyeing. Remember, girls, 
the success of this dance de
pends upon YOU.
hither and yon until the authori
ties finally removed the library 
books from the Hut and return
ed it to its original status as a 
Canteen. This canteen of two 
World Wars became Skibo No. 
II.
While all the former Skibos 
were being destroyed, the third 
and present Skibo was taking 
shape. The building which was re
modelled into Skibo III first ap
peared in World War I as a hang
er, storeroom, and laboratory for 
aviation work. It was then called 
Langley Laboratories. However, 
food eventually took precedence 
over aviation; as a result a cafe

impulse on reading 
you ftfej to write a nasty
repl . y my fellow jeanwes NoNt smoking co-eds
were, lu the least, extremely 
annoyed with its pretentious tone.
However, on second thought, I 
believe you are sincere; and since 
your letter certainly needs reply,
I shall try to keep my answer 
from being an angry retort, al
though its difficult.
You seem terribly concerned 
with the lack of femininity in the 
modern co-ed. You havent given 
your definition of femininity, but 
I think you imply the combed 
hair, pretty dress, shining face, 
and generally the shes lovely, 
she engaged, she uses Ponds 
type. Please understand that there 
is nothing we girls like better 
than to look pretty. We love to 
feel feminine, but there are other 
things important to us, too, and 
sometimes there is a conflict.
Let us look at a woman as a 
human being  she is one, you 
know. The sole purpose of a fe
male human being is not to serve 
as a setting for the male human 
being although she desires to at
tract men just as men desire to 
attract women. Men have other 
ambitions, desires, and purposes in 
life. Why do so many men refuse 
to see that women do too? She too 
wants to see a better world; she 
doesnt want you men who fought 
to come back only to see the whole 
miserable business beginning 
again. And she doesnt believe that 
her part consists of sitting around 
concentrating on making herself 
attractive while she wistfully 
hopes for the best. In short, we 
college girls want to play an ac
tive, not merely an inspirational 
role. Were working hard; weve 
become more interested in living 
wisely and better able to do than 
our un-emancipated sisters were 
(by the way, if you look hard, I 
think youll find us more interest
ing just because of this). We wear 
clothes that are comfortable and 
suitable to our work. Sometimes 
we smoke. So what? Why judge 
a girl by whether or not she 
smokes or by what she wears?
Surely your insight goes deeper 
than that. Perhaps you havent 
admitted the true reason for your 
attitude. Could it be perhaps that 
you resent a woman thinking of 
herself as a human being and dar
ing to put herself on the same 
plane with men? Because thats 
what were doing, you know. 
Youre fighting a losing battle!
I dont want to turn this into 
a battle of the sexes. I dont think 
it is necessary in our generation, 
where weve been forced to gain 
perspective at a young age. I 
would like you both to know that 
we women want to be your friends' 
as well as your sweethearts; that 
we have no desire to be your orna
ments; that, besides faces and fig
ures, we have minds and souls 
even as yourselves; that wed like 
you to look at us, not at what 
were weafing; and that whether 
or not a woman smokes has noth
ing to do with what she is!
Sincerely,
Sheila Berger.
MORE DEFENSE
Dear G. I.
I love youI really doin any
thing . . . You can wear the
khaki of the Armythe college 
suit or sport clothesor any con
fusing combination or wear royal 
blue stripe with orange and 
fushia, I dont complainappear
ance means little to this person.
You seem, however, in your 
letter to the editor of January 
15, to be distressed about the cur
rent habit of a number of campus 
women. I reply in the hope of 
shedding some light on the situa
tion. *
To begin with, Carnegie Tech is, 
fortunately, or unfortunately,' di
vided into four partsthe Library 
School, Margaret Morrison, Engi
neering, and Fine Artswith too 
little communion between the di
visions. Misunderstandings are 
rampant, one of the most com
mon being, as you pointed out, the 
bewilderment concerning the 
shirt-and-denim uniforms of the 
Art School Co-ed. You describe it 
as a pair of torn, grease-splatter
ed, paint-smeared jeans, and a 
cast-off mans shirt, in the same 
condition. I havent seen the tear
everything else: it became the 
army, later the navy, mess-hall. At 
last in the summer 1945, the bean
ery * was redesigned to house a 
small canteen, dining room and 
cafeteria. Above the entrance to 
the new beanery in smart three 
dimensional lettering stands the 
famous name Skibo, Skibo 46.
Student Council
At the regular Student Council 
Meeting on January 13, 1946, the 
following reports were presented: 
A successful Juke-box Dance was 
held after the basketball game 
with W. & J. College. Since the 
Faculty Bridge on the twentythird of February has been can
celled, the Mortar Board Dance 
can be held in Thistle Hall. C. W. 
C. A. was given permission to hold 
a Charity Basketball Game on 
February 20, 1946, in the Mens 
Gym. All proceeds will go to the 
World Student Service Fund. Fred 
Frank has been placed in charge 
of purchasing ten new records for 
the next Basketball Dance; there
after, he will be responsible for 
buying two records for each bas
ketball game this year.
A list of men eligible for Delta 
Skull and Scimitar has been post
ed on the bulletin board.
Augie Binder resigned as of 
February 1, 1946 as Business Man
ager of the Carnegie Technical; 
Art Slagle will take over his work. 
For their work on the Carnegie 
Technical, Augie Binder will re
ceive a gold-jeweled key and Ken

word for it.
Now I would ask a Question 
have you ever seen these same co
eds at work? Have you ever seen 
the sculpture students dig wet 
clay from a barrelmix plaster, 
or dampen burlap material to keep 
their clay assignments moist and 
workable? Have you ever been in 
the attic of Fine Arts and seen 
these (future artists energetically 
applying paint to papermaster
ing technique and effect: have 
you ever watched, the drama stu
dents designing, one hand steer
ing and the other holding down 
a skirt, but one-armed steering is 
dangerous (or did you know?) 
and certainly no fun for the girl. 
Imagine, too, the discomfort of 
horseback-riding in one of the 
skirts of the times?
It seems somewhat trifling to 
discuss this matter of styles to 
such an extent but your letter in
dicates a misunderstanding deep 
enough to deserve attention. You 
also write of girls smokingcall
ing them strange and revolt
ing.
Youll get used to it fellows 
just as women got used to men 
first smoking.

Four Tech Printers 
Plan, Print Magazine
The January issue of the 
Graphis Arts Education which 
is published1 by the National 
Graphic Arts Education Associa
tion, was planned ,and produced 
by four boys in the Printing De
partment of Carnegie Tech. The 
issue commemorated Printing 
Education Week, which is cele
brated during the week of Ben
jamin Franklins birthday, Jan
uary 17.
Credits for the issue should be 
given to Lyman Thompson, Ernst 
Horner, George Mills, and Rob
ert Ripple. Professor Laurance B. 
Siegfried, Head of the Department 
of Printing, is Associate Editor of 
the publication.
Notice
There will be a meeting for 
anyone interested in working 
for the Carnegie Technical at 
live P. M. Friday, February 9 
in the Carnegie Union. Partic
ularly invited are entering 
freshman veterans. Regular 
staff members will be expect
ed to attend also.
Tecvets Hear VA 
Speaker Friday
Mr. McCann of the Veterans 
Administration spoke to the Tec
vets at their meeting last Friday 
evening, February 1, in Room 104, 
Industries Hall. His subject was 
The Problems Facing the Veteran 
in School. After his talk he held 
an open forum to answer questions 
for the Tecvets. Mr. McCann is 
connected with the student train
ing section of the Veterans Ad
ministration.
After the formal meeting, plans 
were discussed for a drive to find 
housing for married veterans. 
Only about half of the married 
veterans on campus were at the 
meeting. The Tecvets hope to con
tact other married veterans on 
campus who have had trouble 
finding places to live. A meeting 
for these veterans will be held in 
the near future. The date and 
place will be announced later.
Any married veteran interested 
should contact an officer of the 
Tecvets or leave his name and ad
dress at Dean Wardens office.
Nature of Research Work 
Revealed hy E.E. Dept
For well over five years, the De
partment of Electrical Engineering 
at the Carnegie Institute of Tech
nology has been engaged in re
search problems of definite mili
tary and defense significance. The 
first of these problems began late 
in 1940 and involved a study of 
thermistor applications for mili
tary purposes. A thermistor is a 
circuit element whose resistance 
has the unusual property of de
creasing rapidly as the tempera
ture increasesquite unlike nor
mal resistors. As a result of this 
property a thermistor can be the 
basis of a circuit that will reject 
large impulses of short duration, 
and hence it may be used to con
trol voltages and to eliminate 
transmission line surges.
At Carnegie this project was 
carried on by Dr. B. R. Teare, Jr. 
and J. F. Lamb, and it involved 
the use of thermistors to control 
electronic systems. The work was 
completed elsewhere, but the re
sults of the preliminary investiga
tion here were favorable and led 
to the disclosure of inventions on 
which patent applications have 
been filed.
From the fall of 1943 until the 
spring of 1945 the department held 
another Office of Scientific Re
search and Development contract 
to do important work in the design 
of the Rotaflail. This device 
somewhat resembles the British 
scorpion and is used to detonate 
safely antitank mines on the bat
tlefield. It consists of a huge ro
tating drum upon which many 
chains are wound. It is mounted 
on the front of a tank, and as it 
is pushed forward the chains con1 tinuously fly out, flail the ground 
ahead, and rewind themselves 
. upon the rotating drum.
This project involved model 
studies and calculations; a method 
of experimentation was devised, 
and measuring devices were built. 
The successful completion of the 
work at Carnegie led to the build
ing and testing of a full-scale 
model at the Aberdeen Proving 
Grounds in Maryland. Engaged 
in this work were Dr. B. R. Teare, 
W. P. Caywood, W. R. Yarlett, and 
E. Litot.
Simultaneously the department 
did fundamental work on the de
velopment of a gauge to accurately 
determine the contents of,an air
planes fuel tank. The loops and 
turns made by an airplane in 
flight make ordinary float gauges 
quite unsatisfactory at times. An 
acoustics volume-measuring device 
was designed to measure the quan
tity of fuel, even when it is not 
l^yel and on the bottom of the 
tank. It works on the principle of 
measuring the pressure variations 
in the vapor above the liquid fuel 
caused by periodically changing 
the volume of the tank slightly 
with a reciprocating diaphragm. 
Since the quantity of liquid fuel 
remaining in the tank is directly 
related to the amplitude of the 
measured pressure oscillation, an 
accurate determination of it can 
be had.
The department now has a con
tract with the Army Air Forces 
for certain radar developments. 
The present group includes Dr. B. 
R. Teare, Dr. E. M. Williams. D. 
L. Trautman, G. Shaw, and W. 
P. Caywood. Professor Williams 
is especially qualified to do such 
work, having until quite recently 
been in charge of a laboratory 
doing work of a similar nature at 
Wright Field.
Vets Register; 
Confusion Reigns
So I got a job registering vet
erans. A position which entailed 
asking each (in most cases be
wildered) future student to sign 
a blank paper as he passed from 
a girl in red called Mary to a girl 
in blue called June. Before leav
ing his signature, one vet, shy, but 
firm, demanded proof that he was 
not signing a re-enlistment blank.
I never did1 discover what happen
ed either before they came or after 
they left mea debateable ques
tion, I supposed, judging from the 
general confusion that prevailed. 
One poor Freshman, not even a 
vet, stood in line for two hours 
before discovering his mistake.
Of course I took this job to fill 
the hole in a leaky allowance, the 
result of losing one boring five 
dollar Economics book that never 
did much in the way of helping me 
solve my own financial problems. 
My problems seem relatively sim
ple as compared to those of one 
vet whose only source of income 
(his monthly checks) was sent to 
a farmer in Wisconsin for a rea
son known only to Army ef
ficiency. This ex-G. I., and others 
in a similar poverty-stricken situ
ation, are now petitioning Student 
Council for a soup-kitchen.
I wonder if Miss Winchesters 
Department was not quite its ef
ficient self, or whether one sar
castic soul was responsible for the 
change of an F to a D, mak
ing a worried vets application 
read Dull time day student. Dr. 
Rike did a rush business without 
once reaching for the traditional 
pink pill, as he sent away scores 
of vets misled by orders to see 
the Doctor, official nick-name for 
Dr. Work, head of the Veterans 
Bureau. An animal usually much 
ignored was eagerly sought by 
befuddled vets when they were 
told to get permits to register from 
the Black Cat. One Weary, disheveled, but determined G. I., 
stood before our finally cleared 
Veterans Center, after he had 
waited for lunch, jior a permit, for 
a schedule, and, fr coupons, 
searching frantically for the end 
of a non-existent jine.
Its all over now, but I shall 
ever wonder what happened to 
one completely perplexed purple 
heart man who, when told to fol
low his folio down the line, dis
appeared into the filing cabinet.
Notice
On Friday there will be a 
meeting of all those interest
ed in working on the Tartan 
and sharing in these recent 
spectacular new develop
ments. The meeting will be 
held at 5:00 P. M. in the 
Union. Everybody is welcome!
Tartan Gets Face Lifted 
Via Prof. L. B. Siegfried
Presenting the man whose aid 
and inspiration is responsible for 
the new Tartan set up this week 
Laurance B. Siegfried.
The cheery, warm-hearted head 
of the Department of Printing and 
Professor of Graphic Arts has 
been at Carnegie Tech since last 
July. While busily engaged in re
constructing the war-ridden Print
ing Department, he was discov
ered by the heads of the publica
tions, who readily saw in this be
guiling Will Rogers-Cary Grant 
personality a guiding light. Since 
then his office has been no longer 
solely the nucleus of the Printing 
Department, but the general in
formation and inspiration station 
for the hierarchy of the publica
tions.
Since he was graduated from 
Harvard in 1913 A. D., Mr. Sieg
fried has had experience in print
ing, publishing, and advertising. 
He is former editor of the Ameri
can Printer, has written a book 
Typographic Design in Advertis
ingand many articles. He was 
judge of National News Typogra
phy Contest in 1934, and has talk
ed to many printing and advertis
ing groups in the East. In 1940, 
however, he says he got religion 
and turned academic. From the 
timeof his conversion until last 
July he was University Printer and 
Associate Professor of Journalism 
at Syracuse University. In this ca
pacity he taught all the graphic 
arts courses, edited, designed and 
supervised all publications, was 
managing director of University 
Publishing Co. and eventually ed
itor of it. (We didnt think of ask
ing him what he did in his spare 
time.) When he left dear old S. U. 
they found that no two men could 
replace him, so they hired three 
to do the job. His religion did
not go unrecognized. In 1943, 
while still at Syracuse, he receiv
ed the Harry J. Friedman Me
morial Gold Medala citation for 
service in the cause of graphic 
art education.
When asked for a comment on 
Pittsburgh and Carnegie Tech, 
there ensued a long silence. 
(Whats coming now)  Well, 
Carnegie Tech is all right. But, 
dont get me talking on Pittsburgh 
because I couldnt do it without 
profanity. It seems the professor 
thinks along the same lines as 
many other people do.
Despite the fact that up to this 
time your impression of Professor 
Laurance Siegfried is that he eats, 
sleeps, and lives printing and 
journalism, we want you to know 
that there is another aspect to his 
personality. Mr. Siegfried, like 
many fellow Americans, has been 
forced to condense his living space 
in moving to Pittsburgh, has a 
great interest in his wife and two 
sons, and two hobbies, symphonic 
music and detective stories. His 
only vice is his pipeI mean pipes 
the technic is to smoke four 
pipes in rotation and have at 
least three sets to keep one go
ing. Your arithmetic is correct if 
this adds up to twelve. But, and 
I quote the master himself, it is 
an improvement on Professor 
Cleetons cigars. He doesnt look 
like a prof. He doesnt act like a 
prof. Hes nice; we like him.
Maybe I shouldnt tell you this 
(its the Bob Burns in me coming 
out) but The Boss has been 
looking for something in Pennsyl
vania which he cant seem to find. 
Now maybe you can help him out. 
Where are the fish in this State? 
With this well leave Professor 
Siegfrieda man who is bound to 
mean more to C. I. T. in the 
months to follow.

THE OARNEOIE TARTANTUESDAY, FEBRUARY 5, 1946
End Man on the Senior Fence
By CASEY STINE
(In which the End Man gets 
back in the rut after that small 
vacation at the end of the semes
ter and forgets about his factor, 
which was equally small.)
Pittsburgh Round-Up:
At the Mosque tomorrow night, 
Tommy Dorsey and orchestra 
(Dancing: 9 to 1) . . . Carmen 
Jones still at the Nixon . . . 
lots of tickets still available. . . . 
The Late George Apley at the 
Nixon next week . . . Patrice
Munsel sings at the Mosque on 
22nd . . . Vladimir Horowitz
at the Mosque on March 23 . . . 
The Little Foxes, with Elise 
Cox, at the Playhouse . . . Night 
Must Fall begins at the Little 
Theatre here at Tech next week
Four Burps to the Breeze 
Department:
Burp One is for the Adminis
tration and their 8:30 classes. The 
End Man has five 8:30s, three of 
them being Introduction to Edu
cation and at 8:30 in the morn
ing, brother, does he need to be 
introduced! . . . Burp Two is for 
the Administration (still) for 
spoiling our semester vacation by 
having registration on Wednesday 
and Thursday and starting back 
to school on Friday. My! My! . . . 
Burp Three is for the Administra
tion (yet) for giving three-iourths 
of the school a lunch hour at 
12:30. You cant get near the 
place! . . . Burp Four is for the 
Administration (again) or who
ever happens to be in charge of 
the time that the cashiers office 
is open. We want it open before 
10:30 in the morning and certain
ly open a few hours on Saturday! 
Four Shouts to the Wind 
Department:
Shout One is for Carmen 
Jones at the Nixon, which brings 
Bizet up to date and certainly im
proves his lyrics . . . Dats Love 
and Beat Out That Rhythm on 
a Drum are this corners favor
ites . . . Shout Two is for the 
Carnegie Plaid, which always 
manages to get material that in
terests both day and night stu
dents. The End Man would per
sonally like to shake the hand of 
the person who writes the little 
blurbs about the plays given by 
the Drama Department . . . Shout 
Three is for Schulbergs and their 
French-fried cheese sandwiches 
. . . Shout Four is for Tom Lakowski and Scottie Yurchison for 
knocking themselves out in prep
aration for the Beaux Arts Ball 
(which, by the way, will be STAG 
and will be on April 5).
Carnegie Techiana 1946:
People Are Talking About De
partment: People are talking about 
the fact that Kahns is no longer 
Kahns. New owners . . . Car
negie co-eds are still angry about 
the Letter to the Editor in the 
last issue of the Tartan. All the 
girls are wondering if Messrs. Catullo and Mann have tried to get 
a date since then . . . Seniors in 
general and Irwin Aisewberg in 
particular are wondering (at 
present writing) whether theyre 
graduating or not, and ALL of 
us are really sorry to see them 
leave. The opinion of some of us 
is that we will probably get to 
know their children very well 
should their parents send them to 
Tech some years hence. Well still 
be here . . . People are disgusted 
with the Ballet Russe de Monte 
Carlo for presenting a very un
interesting and stale program ths 
other night. The End Man even 
resents the $1.80 he spent for a 
seat. He could have seen Car
men Jones again . . . People 
are anxious to read Gladys 
Schmitts new book, and some 
illiterates have even gone so far 
as to say that she knew David 
the King personally . . . Every
one seems to have different opin
ions as to the value of The Lost
Week-end, and a number of peo
ple have left the Ritz Theatre 
feeling very thirsty . . . Lots of 
people are wondering what the 
cover of the Scottie will be, and 
the Arts students are wondering 
what theyll wear to the Beaux 
Arts Ball. In case you still havent 
heard, the theme of the Ball is to 
be surrealism. . . . Everyone 
who has been to Tech for more 
than three weeks wishes that 
someone would change the color 
scheme of the Beanerythat or
ange and black ceases to remind 
us of Halloween and has become 
downright nauseating.
This I Love Department:
Sada Thompson (no relation to 
Mr. Somerset Maughams fair
haired girl) is inspired by the be
ginning of each month and writes 
little maxims. The End Mans 
favorite is for the month of Janu
ary, which goes: Stay as sweet 
as you are and dont drive thru 
any open drawbridges is my 
Christmas wish for youLeota 
Claflin. . . . Sophie Tucker has 
a wonderful new album which 
everyone should listen to, and 
Leonard Bernstein has Victorized 
his Jeremiah Symphony, which 
everyone should purchase . . . 
Heard in an Oakland drug store 
one morning: An elderly man had 
just been served by a waitress, 
who had presented him with a 
particularly archaic egg. The el
derly man asked, What is the 
matter with that egg? The wait
ress looked him up and down and 
flashed: I dont know. I only 
laid the table. . . . The End Man 
is very happy. He has decided 
what he wants inscribed on his 
tomb stone. He has come to the 
conclusion that the best of all 
hes thought of is merely, I 
Thought Id Die! . . . And did 
you hear what Frank Sinatra is 
calling his life story? The title 
will be All/That I Have < . . I
Owe.The worst pun weve
heard is what the official from the 
telephone company said at the 
beginning of a convention speech. 
He said: Gentlemen, youll dial 
when you hear this one. . . . 
The Chicago Tribune says that 
one John Richardson plans to 
cross raccoons with kangaroos 
and thus grow college boy coats 
with pockets. Mr. Richardson is 
about twenty years too late . . . 
Definition of predestination: Its 
like saying a train is late before 
it starts . . . Theres also the one 
about the lady who sent her hus
bands income tax payment to 
the Eternal Revenue Department 
. . . Prime example of the movie 
influence over the minds of the 
young is the way a little boy end
ed his prayers: Hollywood be 
Thy name. . . . And this we 
love better than all else: Mrs. 
Roosevelt has been in England for 
some time now. On her arrival, 
she was greeted by a throng sing
ing God Save the King.
Aviation Featured
Captain Eddie Rickenbackers 
life will be used as the frame
work for telling the story of 
American aviation <on the air, be
ginning the week of February 2. 
The Longine-Wittenauer Watch 
Company will sponsor these 
broadcasts over a nationwide ra
dio hook-up. Pittsburgh will re
ceive the broadcasts on station 
WJAS on Mondays from 10:30 to 
11:00 P. M. Written by Colonel 
Hans Christian Adamson, these 
dramatizations begin with the 
fight for survival of Captain 
Rickenibacker and his companions 
on a raft after a fuel-exhaustion 
ditching in the mid-Pacific. They 
will cover the saga of American 
aviation from the first efforts of 
the Wright brothers, through the 
struggle to develop long-range 
transport, the polar exploration 
flights, and the air battles of 
World War II. The series will con
clude with a fantasy of our aer
ial future, complete with jet-propulsion and rockets through space.
Pi Tau Sigma 
Initiates Nine
Pi Tau Sigma, mechanical en
gineering honorary, recently in
itiated nine men. The installation 
ceremony was held on January 29 
at the Carnegie Union. John F. 
Osterle, Walter A. Blissell, Wil
liam I. Scherb, Robert M. Kerr, 
Merle T. Wolff, and Francis M. 
Dougherty of the Day School, and 
Harold Gassner, George O. Wer

Art Show Accepts 
Painting by Perlman
Word was received last week 
that one of the paintings of Bennard Perlman, P & D Freshman, 
has been accepted in the annual 
Maryland Artists Show at the Mu
seum of Art in Baltimore. The 
painting, a 20x24 inch oil entitled 
"Love Point Ferry, depicts a fer
ry boat ready to pull away from 
its pier with a typical group of 
week-end vacation-seekers.
This exhibit has always been 
held in high esteem because of its 
selectness; and although some 789 
entries were submitted, only 131 
survived the judges critical eyes. 
Bennard also had two oils in the 
annual Paintings of Baltimore 
show last December and another 
in the Maryland Artists Show of 
last year.

TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 5, 19*6THE CARNEGIE TARTAN5
Tech Drops Game To Pace Setting 
West Virginia Cagers To Tune of 62-37
When Tech went down to Morgantown to play West Virginia, the 
question wasnt Can we beat them? It was How can we keep from 
being massacred! Or in the vernacular, we were the underdogs!!
However, when the Tartan five trotted off the floor at intermission, 
the crowd of 5,000 were tense, for Tech in the last few minutes of the 
half had driven to within 3 points of the lead.* Big gun in the first 
half for Tech was Kuzma with 8 points, with the rest of the scoring 
being equally distributed. However, West Virginia came to life in the 
third period as they continually caught Tech with their highly-touted 
fast break and outscored us 24-8. Carroll, star of West Virginias 
smooth passing aggregate, led the attack with 3 field goals and 2 foul 
shots, for a total of 8 points in one period! After that it was merely 
a matter of coasting through the rest of the game.
High scorer for Tech was Gene Hannum with 3 field goals and 6
foul shots for 14 points. He was -----------------------------------------------------
followed by C. T. (Im from Ken
tucky, whats your excuse?) But
ler, and Paul Kuzma, who had 9 
and 8 points respectively.
High men for West Virginia 
were Leverte with 18 followed by 
Carroll who had 12 points.
Sidelights and highlights:
Tech starting the game in a 
jittery fashion, which can be ac
counted for by the huge selloutcrowd of 5,000 (Tech rooters take 
notice).
As a matter of record, this game 
was West Virginias 11th straight 
victory, which has included some 
of the strongest teams throughout 
the East.

AIEE Holds Election
The AIEE held elections at 
their regular meeting Tuesday, 
December the 18th. The following 
men were elected:
Chairman: Arnie Horlick.
Vice Chairmen: Joseph Franz 
and John Martin.
Secretary: John Goodill.
Treasurer: Alex Sherman.
Social Chairman: Cloyd Melott.
Publicity Director: Bob Teasdale.
Profs To Play 
Junior Varsity
As an added attraction at the 
Tech-Geneva game to be held 
February 9 at home, the prelimin
aries will include an extra-league 
battle between the mens faculty 
and the Tech Junior Varsity and 
the womens faculty and the Tech 
Skirtsa girls team.
The mens faculty playoff will 
last for the first quarter, and the 
womens faculty vs. the Tech 
Skirts will form the second period 
of play. The remainder of the 
game will be played by the Tech 
Skirts against the Junior varsity.
Bill Scherb, official coach of the 
game, has announced the follow
ing line-up: For the Tech Skirts, 
Audrey Hobe will act as captain 
with Lil Moravecki, B. J. Kreimer, 
Martha Sant, Rosemarie Lang, 
Emily Barth, Audrey Ransom, 
Audrey Wilkins, Suzanne 
Schmidt, and Ann Dufbsik playing 
on the team. On the Junior Var
sity team, Curly Mintz, Tiger 
Larry Maley, Ting Atman, Fa
ther George Maley, Lover 
Weiss, Scattergood Bane, and 
Wind Storms will play. Just to 
make the sides more even, the 
girls have to be 5* 8 tall.
The list of referees is no less in
teresting. It includes Mr. Max 
Hannum, Dean Yon, Professor 
Dawes, and Miss Winchester. This 
combination would make any 
game interesting, but when they 
are called upon to decide a battle 
like this, anything can happen.
Tartan Swimming Team Loses 
Meets at Case and Oberlin 48-27,50-34
Coach Allen Risedorphs mer
men journeyed up north on Jan
uary 18 and 19 to match strokes 
with Case and Oberlin. We drop
ped both meets to the tune of 
48-27 and 50-34 respectively. The 
Oberlin score is an improvement 
over the 59-16 pasting they ad
ministered here in the Tartan 
waters a few weeks ago.
Macyauskas High Point Man
A1 Macyauskas was again the 
outstanding performer for the En
gineers. A1 copped three firsts at 
Case and on the following day at 
Oberlin he captured a first and a 
second.
At Case, Techs medley team 
started the meet by dropping a 
close contest to the trio represent
ing the Clevelanders. A1 Macy 
then came through with his ini
tial win of the afternoon as he 
splashed the waters for 220 yards 
in the good time of 3:11. Rapid 
Robert Haberstroh copped a close 
third in the 60 yard dash. Then 
Techs capable diver, Zukaski, 
captured a (first in the fancy div
ing event. A1 Macy took first in 
the 100 yard freestyle and follow
ed a few minutes later with a win 
in the 440 yard freestyle event. 
Bab Straka and Vinnie Benya 
took second and third in the 
breaststroke number.
Macyauskas Repeats 440 
At Oberlin
The next day the boys didnt 
fare so well against the stiffer 
Oberlin competition. Bradshaw of 
Oberlin again bested A1 Macy in 
the 220 yard freestyle. Bob Ha
berstroh scored an upset when
ROUND-UP
It is a brand new semester but 
the old Intramural Round-up is 
going to rope in a little of last 
months sporting news to bring 
the readers up to date.
The PiKAs completely domin
ated the ping-pong tables as they 
added to their individual honors 
by capturing the team champion
ship from the Beta Sigs. Dick DiPrima, Bob Herbert, and Ned Fos
ter took three straight singles 
matches to whitewash the oppos
ing finalists.
After racing neck and neck all 
season, the Betas and the Delts 
took about an hour and a half to 
decide a tightly contested post
season play-off in the volley ball 
league. In three games which 
were much closer than the score 
indicates, the Betas displayed 
their spiking skill by capturing the 
championship thoroughly with a 
21-10, 12-21, 21-8 score.
The PiKAs rang the bell 292 
times out of 500 to nose out the 
Delts who put 285 balls through 
the hoop in the intramural foul 
shooting contest. Norman Larson 
sank 39 of the first 50 and 45 of 
the rest for a grand total of 84 out 
of a possible 100 to capture the 
Individual honors, while Frank 
Becker followed in the jmnnerup position with 79.
The Betas are way out in front 
in the race for this years allpoints trophy with the PiKAs 
making a poor second. The situa
tion at the half-way mark looks 
like this:

Tech, crippled by the loss of 
their high scorer, Gene Hannum, 
lost their 8th game of the current 
season to a fast-breaking Juniata 
team by a score of 57-47. The 
Tartan plaid made it a close con
test throughout and at the half 
were only behind by six points. 
However, the persistent Juniata 
five made it their second victory 
over Tech this season by contin
ually catching our defense flatfooted with their fast-breaking 
technique. As has been the cus
tom for the last few games, the 
game was marred by erratic pass
ing, besides the fact that the boys 
missed many scoring opportuni
ties.
Hannum Lost For Season
Though Tech has lost Hannum 
for the rest of the season, three 
experienced veterans (Levy, Mey
ers, and Watson) of past Carne
gie teams, are back in uniform, 
thereby boosting our hopes for fu
ture victories. ,
Kuzma High Scorer For Tech
Diminutive (I can shoot their 
heads off at 100 yards) Butler hit 
his high for the season by scoring 
14 points on 4 field goals and 6 
foul shots. He was second only to 
big Paul (H. C.) Kuzma who was 
high man with 16 points on 8 field 
goals. Big Paul really was hot, 
because his scoring opportunities 
didnt take effect till he got into 
the game five minutes after it 
started.
High man for Juniata was Grote 
with 18 points. A very noticeable 
factor is that Brumbaugh, high 
scorer for Juniata, only scored 10 
points, Whereas in his last go 
against Tech he outdid himself 
by scoring 24 points.
he churned home in front of the 
field in the 50 yard dash. Zukaski 
repeated his performance as run
ner-up to Robertson of Oberlin in 
the fancy diving event, A1 Macy 
continued to be undefeated in the 
440 yard freestyle as he repeated 
his win over Stewart of Oberlin.
Oberlin is considered one of 
the stronger aggregations iri the 
country. They dropped a close de
cision to Ohio State which has 
one of the best teams in the Big 
Ten. Our boys deserve a large pat 
on the back for the improved 
showing, especially due to fact 
that this meet was away from 
home. Most coaches will agree 
that a team does not perform at 
its best when it is in unfamiliar 
surroundings.

Chuck Jewell Returns
With the improved perform
ances of Butler and Kuzma plus 
the return of the thiee vets, and 
the return to uniform of Chuck 
Jewell (who hurt his ankle early 
in the season), Techs hope of up
setting the Pitt five tomorrow 
night has risen considerably.
Sidelights:
A miscalculation in traveling 
plans brought our team to the 
game about 15 minutes late.
Lew (muscle bound) Heiles,
regular guard for the first part of 
the season, didnt make the trip 
because of certain difficulties.

Carnegie Tech has made def
inite plans for the first time in 
three years to participate in 
inter-collegiate track meets. 
Practices will begin as soon as 
the weather permits. Definite 
notices will 'be posted later.
Guy Halferty will coach the

scheduling suitable competition 
are being worked out by Mr. 
Overend.
Bowling and basketball are the 
big news for the coming month. 
Entries for both are due in the 
Intramural office tomorrow even
ing by five oclock. The managers 
of the teams will meet in the in
tramural office at 4:30 this Friday 
afternoon to make final plans for 
the games scheduled to start next 
week. It should be noted by all 
teams that there will be a physical 
examination in the gym at 4:30 
next Monday for all who wish to 
play in the basketball games. No 
one who has not had an examina
tion will be permitted to partici

there is enough interest. Coach 
Alexander will meet with the boys 
three nights a week at 4:45 for 
an hour in Thistle Hall. A large 
turnout will insure individual or 
even team championships.
Swimming Team 
Wants New Men
Since this is the beginning of a 
new semester and many new stu
dents have enrolled here at Tech, 
Coach Risedorph has taken this 
opportunity to extend to any new 
man on campus an invitation to 
try out for the swimming team. 
There is a meet with Case here 
at home, and several others pend
ing, remaining so far. Thus far 
this season the team hasnt been 
too successful in the win column, 
<but that is no measure of the fun 
the fellows have had in the com
petition. All three of the schools 
met so far have had their teams 
bolstered by navy trainees. So 
whats say fellows, come out and 
see what its like to swim in com
petition.
Council Election
Petitions for senior voting mem
ber from Engineering to serve in 
place of Irwin Aisenberg on Stu
dent Council for the remainder of 
the semester must be handed in 
to Miss Orr in the Deans office 
by 4:30 P. M. on February 8. For 
consideration, each petition must 
contain 25 signatures. The election 
will be held February 19.
TECH SPORTING SCENE
By Don Clendenen
This week, the Sporting Scene 
has acquired a new writer, not due 
to the desires of the former col
umnist, Dick Heckman but to the 
whims of the United States Draft 
laws. Going along in his usual, 
easy way, Mr. Heckman did not 
realize that the hand of doom was 
soon to place his icy fingers on 
the shoulders of Scobell Halls 
greatest exponent of free speech. 
It was during exams, when ones 
thoughts should be turning to 
studies, that regards from the 
President of the United States 
were sent to Dick, interrupting a 
very short, though profitable as 
far as the Tartan is concerned, 
career as a writer for Dick. So it 
is with great sorrow that we bid 
adieu to Dick. This news should 
prove very gratifying to a certain 
columnist by the name of Casey 
Stine if he is intellectually enough 
inclined to read such things as this 
questionable column.
Sadness was felt not only in the 
Tartan office as word also has 
emerged of the passing of a great 
basketball player from the Tech 
courts. Gene Hannum has been 
forced due to grades to leave the 
team. He has been the standout 
player on the team throughout 
the year and has led State scor
ing from the start. His presence 
will be missed when Tech faces 
the rest of its opponents, for in 
many games so far this season it 
was obvious that when Hannum 
was not on, the team suffered a 
terrific letdown. With the resign
ing of Max from his post as coach 
last month, and Gene leaving this 
past week, the Tartan basketball 
team is without a Hannum for the 
first time since 1934. Heres wish
ing Gene a lot of luck in what
ever he intends to do from now 
on.
The Tartan basketball team has 
seen a few new additions since 
the new semester has begun. 
Three former members of the 
Tech basketball team have re
turned from the services and are 
renewing their old custom of pop
ping them through the hoops. 
They are Levy, Meyers, and Wat
son. This column wishes to wel
come the fellows back and to say 
that it hopes to hear a lot from 
them in the games to come.
The boys on the swimming team 
are wondering why Clevelands 
gift to the team was indifferent 
when he was approached on the 
part of some of the team to get 
them dates. There he was, sur
rounded by women, all his ardent 
admirers, stoically beating his 
team mates from his shoulders. 
Thats alright, Al, you didnt want 
to be mentioned in their wills any 
way.
There has been a terrific fight 
in the intramurals for the all 
points trophy so far and as things 
are beginning to take a head it 
looks as if the Betas are going to 
have to be pushed quite a bit if 
anyone else is to take the cup 
from them. With basketball the 
next sport on schedule, the rest 
of the season should prove very 
interesting especially on the part 
of the Pi K As who are rumored 
to have at least three men who 
range over six feet in height on 
their team. They also were declar
ed ping pong champions.
This column has been speculat
ing as to who will be appointed 
head coach of the football team 
this fall. There have been rumors 
floating around that the Depart
ment of Athletics is looking 
around for someone to coach both 
basketball and football. Time and 
tide will tell.
With this little bit of tripe off 
my chest, and sleep about to foul 
me up, I stop. Doubt if anyone 
reads it anyway.

THE CARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY, FEBRUARY 5, 1046
One of the Boys
HAROLD GOTTESMAN
Techs loss will be West Points 
gain, for Harold Aaron Gottesman has received that enviable 
appointment from New Jersey for 
the July 1946 Plebe Class. We 
wonder if the Point realizes what 
a terrific kay-det they are get
ting, for Harold will arrive at our 
United States Military Academy 
with his Bachelors and Masters 
Degrees in Mechanical-Aeronau
tical Engineering. Harold receiv
ed his B. S. last Sunday, and in 
May his hard-worked-for Mas
ters will become a reality. Until 
then he will continue living in the 
Tau Delts house on Walnut 
street.
In this outstanding graduate 
from Hillside, New Jersey, you 
will find a rare combination of 
successful scholastic and social en
deavors. Working on C. I. T.s ac
celerated program, Harold has 
carried almost double the normal
load, and yet he has found time 
to take a leading part in campus 
scholastic, social, and athletic ac
tivities. First of all he is known 
on campus as a member of Tau 
Delta Phi social fraternity, of 
which he was Consul last year 
and Assistant Quaester this year. 
He is also the Tau Delts repre
sentative to the Inter-Fraternity 
Council holding the office of Sec
retary. In the field of sports he 
preferred the swimming and rifle 
teams, and was a representative 
to the Intramural Board. We un
derstand from the campus grape
vine that one time he was Busi
ness Manager of the Scottie, and 
if you have been wondering 
about the Tartans Business Man
ager seek no moreits that man 
again.
Harold along other lines is Pres
ident of the Institute of Aeronau
tical Sciences; President of Pi Tau 
Sigma, Mechanical Engineering 
honorary; Treasurer of The Amer
ican Society of Mechanical Engi
neers; member of Tau Beta Pi, na
tional engineering honorary fra
ternity; and Theta Tau, national 
professional society of engineer
ing. He is also to be seen when
ever the Interhonorary meets as 
representative for Pi Tau Sigma. 
His most recent addition to his 
long list of activities came with 
his election to the Senior honor
ary, Omicron Delta Kappa.
Personally, theres a lot more 
that we are just dying to rave 
about, but the most gentleman 
just wont let us. We can tell you 
though that when you see that 
unruly wave, flashing smileand 
oh! those eyes plus that physique 
coming cross campus, you can bet 
that its Gottesman and his in
separable sliderule. Maybe you 
have gathered by now that we 
think this engineer who can take 
his women or leave them is quite
an unusual fellow: a sense of 
humor that never fails; a will to 
work that will carry him to suc
cess; and a personality that has 
won him many lasting friendships 
on Techs campus all make for a 
darn nice guy  Harold Gottes
man.
Chile Profs Sent 
Here On Mission
Six professors from the Univer
sity of Chile who are prominently 
identified with Chiles industrial 
development are here on a tech

J alentine Party Set For Saturday, Feb. 9
Students Urged To Attend Party 
To Meet Fellow Evening Students
Well now that Saturday, Febru
ary 9, is just around the corner, 
we have to incorporate as much 
information as possible into this 
last article pertaining to this St. 
Valentines Party.
The party is being given by 
Evening Student Council primarily 
for the purpose of acquainting 
new students with Tech and with 
other Tech evening students. It 
will not be necessary to bring a 
date, and in fact, it will be more 
fun just coming as a freelancer 
and meeting your fellow students 
on even grounds.
Since the party is to be held in 
the Carnegie Union, the new Even
ing Student coming to Tech for the 
first time will be apt to ask just 
where is the Carnegie Union. 
Well, all one has to do is to walk 
a block up from the entrance on 
Forbes Street, and he will be there.
Since we have taken care of the 
preliminaries, we will continue by 
mentioning the fun we intend hav
ing at the party.
Dancing to recordings is to take 
up the time of those who like to 
dance, and the Social Committee 
intends to make dancing at the 
party an occasion for meeting more 
new friends by having hearttag dances  sounds like fun, 
doesnt it? Well, come and find 
out for yourself what great fun it 
really will be. Thecommittee has
Ofitebv-ieuuMa
We start our interviewing col
umn for jhe new semester with 
great pride, for we would like to 
present to the student body a very 
charming person  Miss Cecille 
Zellner.
A member of the Plaid staff, 
Cecille plays a very important 
role in writing up articles, and is 
usually found typing away with 
great speed. Being a secretary for 
the Army at the Pittsburgh Rail
head, explains why her work is 
always so efficient.
Hailing from McKees Rocks, this 
attractive evening student is tak
ing secretarial English and ad
vanced shorthand, as she starts in 
on her second semester here at 
Tech. She makes a very striking 
figure, being 5 ft., 7*4 inches tall, 
brown hair (cut to a 3 inch bob), 
and brown eyes.
When it comes to sports, CeciUe 
enjoys camping very much dur
ing her summer months. She was 
a counselor for two years for girls 
from 9 to 12 at Camp Cheerio, 
Butler, Pa. She loves the water, 
and delights in going swimming 
three times a day while at camp. 
Ice skating also proves very en
tertaining to this evening student, 
and she can dot an i perfectly.
Heading her list of hobbies is 
none other thaneating! You ask 
what! Well, its a big plate of 
French-fried shrimp. And ac
cording to Cecille, it cant be beat. 
She collects odd nick-nacks of all 
sorts, and has gathered together 
quite a large assortment.
Cecille spends a great deal of 
her spare time playing with Dinah, 
her black spaniel. Dancing is also 
a favorite pastime, and according 
to reliable sources, boys, she is one 
of the best. If you dont believe 
us, come out to the valentine party 
this coming Saturday night and 
see for yourselves. *
When asked to relate any em
a surprise stunt up their sleeve 
that promises to be a pip. Then in 
the basement of the Union will be 
found ping pong tables so that 
those who feel like spending a lit
tle energy will find the occasion 
by challenging some other student 
to a friendly game. .
There are very few people who 
dont like a friendly game of cards 
now and then, and this party will 
offer the opportunity to play any 
type of cards you care to play. 
Just mention your poison, and 
zingo! quicker than you can count 
ten, you will find yourself kindly 
placed down in front of a card 
table, and who knows that your 
partner might turn out to be the 
person youve been wanting to 
meet all these years.
Whats a Tech Evening affair 
without those appetizing and tasty 
sandwiches? Well, no need to fret, 
for the committee in charge of 
refreshments promises that there 
will be plenty of tasty tidbits to 
tease the most discriminating 
appetite.
Now that we have written as 
much as we have, we wonder if 
there is anything that we have 
missed? Yep! We have forgotten 
to mention the time9:00 to 12:00, 
Saturday, February 9. Well, now 
that all is said, the only thing re
mains to do is to be present at the 
party and meet your fellow stu
dents. Make this semester the 
beginning of bigger and better so
cial affairs here at Tech.
barrassing moments, she related 
how she was criticized for jay
walking over a loud speaker while 
visiting East Liverpool, Ohio. 
Bringing one up to date, and also 
to prove how confused a person 
can be when reaching the very 
end of the registration line, Cecille 
handed in last semesters registra
tion card. Cheer up, my dear, re
member things can always be 
worse.
We of the Plaid staff consider 
ourselves very fortunate to have 
Cecille as a regular member of the 
staff. For being a hard worker, a 
good sport, and having a great 
sense of humor, its really a pleas
ure to have her at the Union every 
Friday evening. Heres wishing 
she stays with us a long, long 
time.
Workers Neetled
Workers are needed! Workers 
are needed! That has been said 
before, but evidently to no avail. 
The plea has gone unheeded. 
Really the necessity for willing 
people to come out and work for 
the various affairs held on the 
campus is very acute. But it isnt 
all work, its fun, too, and dont 
forget the point system that has 
been established by Council. When 
sufficient points have been earned, 
the student receives an insignia. 
Taking the form of a key, the in
signia has as its background the 
Carnegie Tartanred, blue, green, 
and yellow. Superimposed upon 
this background are the letters
C.I.T. and a white crescent. This 
is an award really worth earning.
Why not start accumulating 
some points by helping our social 
chairman with the Valentine Party 
schedule on February 9. You can 
contact him by writing in care of 
Evening Student Council, Box 256, 
or just by dropping in at the 
PLAID office in the Carnegie 
Union any Friday night. Who is 
hewhy, Frank Mihelich.
E. S. C. Treasurer 
Transfers With 
Westinghouse
The office of the PLAID just 
isnt the same anymore since Joe 
Rymer left for Buffalo last week. 
This handsome man and willing 
worker is certainly missed at the 
PLAID meetings and student activities. The presence of Joe and 
his wife, Evelyn, at our parties 
always added to the success of the 
evening.
Joe left an extremely impressive 
record behind him at Evening 
School when he traveled to Buf
falo with the Westinghouse offices, 
where he is employed. After 
graduating in 1937 from Turtle 
Creek High, Joe completed a 
course at Westinghouse Technical 
Night School. Joe began his work 
for a degree in Mechanical En
gineering at the evening classes at
C.I.T. shortly after this, and 
achieved recognition in his school 
work as well as in extra-curricular activities. As president of the 
College of Engineering in 1943-44, 
he still found time in the same 
year to be News Editor of the 
PLAID. The following year he 
was appointed as editor of the 
PLAID, which he fulfilled quite 
capably. Joes humor, good nature, 
and ability made him a welcome 
worker on the PLAID at all times. 
His being treasurer of the Evening 
Student Council this year was in
terrupted by his transfer to Buf
falo.
Joe was a member of Pi Delta 
Epsilon, national journalistic fra
ternity; Nu Sigma Alpha, honor
ary evening fraternity; Pi Tau 
Sigma, honorary mechanical fra
ternity; and Sigma Delta Phi, so
cial fraternity of which he was 
secretary.
Good luck, Joe, in your new 
home, and may you always re
member the friends who miss you 
at C.I.T.
Tickets for Students
New students entering Carnegie 
Tech Evening School this semester 
will be glad to learn that they are 
entitled to two tickets for each 
play produced by the Tech Drama 
Department. These plays are pre
sented periodically in the Little 
Theater in the College of Fine 
Arts and the dates of each play 
will be announced in the Plaid.
Tickets can be secured at Mr. 
McKelways office, Room 255-C, in 
the Administration Building.
Happy Days are gone again. 
From all indications, it appears 
that there will be a slightly smaller 
evening student group this semes
ter . . . Just like old home week 
a lot of old faces turning up 
. . . Bob Stock is back in even
ing school after having been in the 
Navy for the past two years. With 
the intention of finishing up next 
fall, Bob has enrolled in the day 
school and has also signed up for 
three evenings a week . . . Thats 
what makes Tech men desirable in 
any shop in the countryability 
to take it ... It seems as though 
some of our evening coeds are 
switching from general studies to 
Home Economics. The rumor that 
the classes in cooking were to be
come larger has become a fact 
forebodings of the future! . . . 
Wonder why some women wear 
diamonds on their right hand and 
chains on their left foot? Is it 
indicative of frustration, hope or 
disappointment? Could be inheri
tance!! . . . What caused the hub
bub among the girls in Fridays 
8:30 English class? Could have 
been because the new instructor 
turned out to be a goodlooking, 
curly-haired Veteran. Hold me! 
Hold me! . . . The complaints 
about the school lighting system 
continue. Evidently these Tech 
students are not as bright as the 
administration supposes . . . The 
turnout at the Shakespearean 
presentation As You Like It was 
extremely good, and the perform
ance itself was superb. However, 
there didnt appear to be many 
students presentnot compared to 
the number of older folks. Cer
tainly the Drama school is to be
commended upon the excellence of 
its presentation . . . Upon reading 
the article Relativity Made Easy 
by Robert Teasdale, I have de
cided that if the average freshman 
believes he is as intelligent as the 
article supposes he is, he is just a 
darned fool. If upon reading this 
you decide to test yourself, just 
grab the October issue of The 
Technical and weep . . . r'h ? 
have been many queries about + r 
goodlooking blond hard at wet' t 
the gym on registration night . . .
Swim Wednesday Ev
Maybe the weather out?ld~ s 
frightful, but inside it cm he 
delightful. Shiver as you mrv. 
you cant help but enjoy a go d 
swim. Weve told you oldsters on 
the campus about these opportu
nities before; but for the newly 
initiated, well go through this 
again.
Every Wednesday from 7:00 to 
10:00 p. m. the swimming pool in 
the Gymnasium Building is open 
to the evening students.
Temporary lockers are availa
ble and Mr. Ralph A. Eyman will 
be there to help those who request 
extra coaching. We cant promise 
tropical fish, and sandy beaches 
dotted with bright umbrellas, but 
if youll rotund up those friends of 
yours and come out next Wednes
day, we think we can show you 
something in the way of bathing 
beauties. . .
Remember now, Wednesday 
evenings from 7:00 to 10:00 in the 
Gym. Cmon in; the waters fine.

Scene of much activity this past 
week was the Tau Delt house. 
Tuesday night was the date of 
their rushing banquet at which 
professors David Moskovitz and 
Max Frocht as well as several of 
the fraternitys alumni spoke to 
the group. Then early Wednes

work, and by the time Friday roll
ed around they had completely re
decorated the house in a modern 
two-tone theme. A theater party 
was on the schedule for Friday 
evening, the-opening of The Lit
tle Foxes at the Playhouse being 
the destination. Not content with 
two social events in one week, the 
Tau Delts planned a third one anc 
the biggest of them all for Satur
day night, when they held theii 
Final Daze dance, their first pro
gram dance in over two years 
The highlight of the evening 
was Danny Franks MCing to pre
sent the graduating seniors fron 
the house with gifts from the fra
ternity. Ben Schwartz received ai 
album of records, and Harold Got 
tesman, a set of bookends. Just t< 
make the evening complete, th<

swers to the name of Pika (fo 
PiKA). All the gals agree tha 
he is a typical PiKAcuddly!
With that we leave you to fin 
your way to your 8:30 class eac

M. E. Dept. Installs 
New Fuel-test Motor
An engine designed to test fuels 
has been installed in the Mechan
ical Laboratory of Carnegie Tech. 
The C. F. R. (Cooperative Fuels 
Research) engine, installed and 
put in operation by the Depart
ment of Mechanical Engineering, 
is fitted for testing and rating of 
fuels for internal combustion en
gines.
The engine is the product of 
years of intensive work and was 
developed jointly by the American 
Society for Testing Materials and 
a committee known as the Coop
erative Fuels Research Committee, 
composed of members of the Am
erican Petroleum Institute, the 
Automobile Manufacturers Asso
ciation, Society of Automotive En
gineers, and the National Bureau 
of Standards.
New Technical Staff
The Carnegie Technical has 
elected several members to new 
positions on the staff. Art Slagle 
is the new Business Manager; Tom 
Farrahy, the new Advertising 
Manager; and Mary Lou Mooney, 
Circulating Manager. Art Slagle 
moving from the position of Ad
vertising Manager replaces Augie 
Binder. Mary Lou Mooney re
places Kenneth Lippman, who is 
graduating.
Tartan Selects Cubs, 
Reporters, Columnists
The Tartan elections held Feb
ruary 1 resulted in several pro
motions. The basis for these pro
motions was the number of hours 
that the reporter worked for the 
Tartan, and also the number of 
inches of type accredited to him.
Advanced to the position of 
Cub Reporter were: Celeste Silberstein, Gerry Sunseri, and Bar
bara Vilsmeier; from Cub to Re
porter: Tony Arrott, Doris Becker, 
Marie DelliGatti, Viera Kulamer, 
and Shirley Seiner.
Casey Stine and Bteey Jane 
Kreimer, although not desiring to 
become reporters, are regular col
umnists for the Tartan.
The next elections will be held 
in six weeks.
