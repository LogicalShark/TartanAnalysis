The wearers of the Tartan triumphed 
over the boys from the Western Uni
versity on Saturday in closely contested 
game which ended with a score of 4-31 
Although the day was a trifle chilly 
which was responsible for the poor at
tendance, it had little effect upon the 
playing of either team and fast work was 
ever in evidence. Willis pitched his 
usual star game and completely mystified 
the Wup batsmen with his curves. 
Thornhurst who did the twirling for the 
Western University pitched a good game 
but the Tech basemen found him at 
critical times. Neudorfer was to be de
pended upon every time he stepped to 
the plate and Halferty brought the spec
tators to their feet when he smashed a 
three-bagger to left.
Capt. Lytle suffered a severe sprain to 
his ankle in sliding to second and had 
to retire from the game. Kirk took his 
place and Slocum was put in right field 
where lib showed up well. The score:

From time to time, apparatus which 
was of interest primarily as illustrating 
some physical principle, has proven to be 
of great commercial importance.

The two essential features of this ap

The Sender is a speaking arc lamp. 
As arranged in the Physics Laboratory, 
the current from the 110 volt lighting 
circuit is passed through the arc lamp, 
V and the primary P, of a small induc
tion coil.
The current from a 6 volt storage 
battery is parsed through the secondary , 
S. of the induction coil, and through a 
carbon telephone transmitter, T.
Under these conditions, there will be 
a steady current of 10-15 ampers in the 
circuit of the primary coil P, and the 
arc lamp, while a much smaller steady 
current flows through the secondary coil 
S, and the transmitter T.
When a sound is produced near the 
transmitter, the sound waves produce a 
variable pressure upon the loosely pack
ed carbon particles, causing rapid varia
tions in the transmitter resistance.
These variations of resistance in the 
circuit of the storage battery cause slight 
variations in the current passing through 
the Secondary coil S.
The slight variations in the current 
through S induce corresponding varia(Continued on page 7.)

TECH. WINS DUAL MEET.
On Saturday the Tech. Schools Track 
Team held a dual meet with the Shadyside Academy Teach, Tech. coming out 
an easy winner by the score of 22 to 14. 
Tech.s score would have been much 
larger had we not been handicapped by 
being forced to use the 16-pound 
weights. All the Tech. men showed up 
well considering the little training they 
have had, but the work of Dowling and 
Urling stood out most prominent. The 
showing made by both Beeken and 
Thomson is also worthy of mention.

What time did you get up, and 
did you eat any breakfast? were 
questions heard on all sides this morn
ing.
Talking about the effects of victory, 
one of our students was so elated over 
last Saturdays victory on the diamond 
he could not get to sleep himself, and 
so kept all his friends awake too.
Shoop looks like a winner with the 
long stick. He beat his opponents last 
Saturday without half trying.
Every mother's son was looking long
ingly at the cool and shady spots in 
the park yesterday.
Whats wrong with Watrous lately? 
He goes around with his head bent for
ward as though looking for something. 
Hit him on the back of the neck and 
see what happens!

ORE-BOAT UNLOAD5RS.
In ore transportation the cost of the 
boat-loading and unloading is a large 
part of the expense. The surface min
ing with steam shovels, the gravity-car 
system to ore docks, combined with the 
automatic ore chutes for boat-loading, 
enables many of the ore operators in 
the Upper Lake regions to place the 
ore in the boat very quickly and at a 
small cost. The largest boat may now 
be easily loaded in one or two hours 
with a cargo of 5,000 to 6,000 tons and 
with the employment of practically no 
hand labor.
The expansion of the ore market has 
developed special ore-boats of which the 
Augustus B. Wolvrin is a good type. 
The length of 560 feet, a tonnage of 
8,000, and an average speed of over 12 
miles per hour were extraordinary feat
ures for inland boats a few years ago, 
but now the members of this class are 
numerous and the cheapest to operate. 
The season tonnage for each boat of the 
500-foot class is enormous. In 1906 the 
IV. E. Corey moved 302,547 tons of ore 
in 30 trips; this is more than a whole 
fleet would carry 20 years ago. With 
boats of such an enormous cargo, the 
time consumed in unloading is valuable, 
and the problem of how to quickly and 
cheaply discharge the heavy and bulky 
cargo has received much attention from 
engineers and ore-handling companies.
In the early days of ore-shipping it 
would have required 50 men working 
with hand-filled buckets nearly 23 
hours to unload a cargo of the Augus
tus B. Wolvrin, but at the present time 
such a cargo is removed from the hold 
and placed on the cars or in the stock 
piles in four or five hours. The saving
in expense and time during a season for 
some 80 boats, which is the present 
number of the ore fleet, is no small 
amount. The great unloaders have grad
ually grown from the whirlers to the 
buckets on the bridge tram and into the 
electric fast plants of to-day.
The great modern unloaders are elec
trically operated and require a small 
amount of labornot over three men. 
The first cost of the machines is high, 
hut the time and labor saved proves 
their economy. The repair bill is low 
and the amount of dock room required 
to handle immense amounts of ore is 
small, which is a great advantage in 
some of he crowded ports on Lake Erie.
One of the most modern of these ma
chines is the Hulett io-ton electric un
loader. These machines are in opera
tion at Conneaut, Lorain, Buffalo, and 
various other places, while a number are 
to be installed at Gary, Indiana. Each 
machine consists of two heavy parallel 
iron girders at right angles to the face 
of the dock and mounted on moving 
trucks which span four or more rail
road tracks. On the two girders a car
riage travels back and forth, carrying 
a long pivot walking beam. On the 
front, or the water end, of this walking 
beam is a vertical dependent leg, to 
which is attached the grab bucket. 
This leg always maintains a vertical 
position. The operator who controls 
the bucket rides in a cab on the lower 
end of the leg directly above the bucket. 
In operation the walking beam oscillates 
up and down, carrying the bucket down 
into the hold of the boat and up above 
the dock. The travel of the carriage 
back and forth on the heavy girders 
carries the walking beam and the buck
et out over the boat and back over the 
dock.
The average grab" of the bucket is 
nearly 10 tons, and one machine alone 
has taken out of a vessels hold 681 
tons of ore in one hour. Four of these 
great machines have removed 9,945 
tons in four and a half hours. This is 
equivalent to filling a large freight car 
in 60 seconds or loading a train of 45 
cars of 40 tons each in three-quarters 
of an hour. With boats of so great a 
tonnage and unloaders of this great ca
pacity, it will not be long before 50 mil
lion tons of iron ore will be moved in 
a single season. In 1906 38 million tons 
was the seasons record, arid with the 
prospective new boats and unloaders, 
nearly 48 million tons will be moved in 
1907.IV. M. Gregory, Cleveland, Ohio.
RECLAIMING THE SWAMPS IN 
SACRAMENTO AND SAN JOA
QUIN VALLEYS, CAL.
In California the State has been en
gaged for many years in studying pro
jects for and aiding in the reclamation 
of overfloded and swamp land in the 
lower Sacramento and San Joaquin 
Valleys. These lands are so low lying 
that gravity drainage by ditches has 
been found impracticable and reclama
tion is by the contruction of levees and 
the pumping of the enclosed area. Some 
of the protective works in that State 
are of great extent, covering from sev
enteen to sixty thousand acres each and 
involving expenditures ranging from 
$150,000 to $1,250,000 in various dis
tricts. At present there is under con
sideration a systematic scheme for 
leveeing, drainage, and pumping, the 
construction of which will cost many 
millions of dollars. Individual, county, 
district, and' other independent efforts 
have resulted in the expenditure of 
over seventeen million dollars for con
struction purposes in this area which 
have been actually wasted, as the work 
of reclaiming will have to be done over 
on broader and more comprehensive 
lines, so that the drainage for these 
vast areas of submerged land may ulti
mately involve expenditures exceeding 
twenty-five millions' of dollars.

success in every feature. The boys had 
worked hard in the arrangement of the 
hall on Friday and in the evening when 
their young lady friends were ushered 
in, they were greeted with the sight of 
beautifully decorated booths, represent

191I
NIGHT STUDENTS CEASH.
Applied Science mid Trade School Rep
resentatives Indulge in a 
Lively Melee.
That two bodies cannot occupy the 
same place simultaneously was con
clusively demonstrated last Wednesday 
evening in room 105.
The contending bodies were a large 
delegation from the trade schools and 
six members of the 1911 class of Applied 
Science. The former were the aggres
sors and ultimate victors in the struggle 
which was in detail as follows:
At 9:30 a group of men from the 
class of 1911 asked permission of Mr. 
Leete to use a room for the purpose of 
holding a private meeting. This wras 
given and room 105 was assigned. Upon 
adjournment to said room it developed 
that this same place was the selected 
rendevouz for a baseball meeting by the 
tradesmen.
By the use of diplomatic language and 
a display of perfect amity, the Scientists 
were left in possession of the room and 
proceeded at once to the business in 
hand.
The tradesmen soon regretted their 
magnanimity and returned with the in
tention of holding their meeting in the 
room they had just vacated.
They were anticipated a little by the 
wily Scientists who had stationed a man 
on guard, and when the tradesmen ap
proached he gave a warning shout and 
the other five increased by two late 
comers rushed to the door and held it. 
Surprised and baffled the tradesmen re
treated for a consultation while the 
doughty Scientists treated them to a 
laugh of scorn and a class yell.
A policy of defense was oulined while 
the enemy planned a new mode of attack 
and hunted up reinforcements. From 
the volume of sound emanating from 
the inside in rythmic and harmonious 
unison the tradesmen thought they had 
a multitude to deal with.
After a few minutes the aggressive 
pliers of the (chipping) hammer renew
ed the attack. This time in the form of 
strategy and applied science of the 
a wedge.
Again were they repulsed by the 
Spartan octet, who massed their 
strength on the free edge of the door 
thus obtaining a good leverage. At 
this stage of the game the burly half 
back of 1911 foot ball team went outside 
and defied the whole strength of the op
position. When the door opened to let 
Charlie in another rush was made 
with no greater success than in the 
previous endeavors.
For about thirty-five minutes the latter 
waged intermitently and would have 
been still on had not the vignance of the 
Scientists relaxed for a moment. At 
this particular moment a concerted 
movement was made by the now desper
ate tradesmen. A breach was effected in 
the defense; a stick thrust in the door; 
and slowly the door opened.
Edwards and Stamm met the on
slaught and held the whole force until 
their comrades came to their aid. The 
struggle was now furious. All of the 
Scientists gave every ounce of their 
strength but it was in vain. With a 
ghoulish yell of mingled triumph and 
hate the plebian horde passed the door
way and instead of the army they ex
pected to see, they beheld seven men and 
a boy (named Hess).
The Scientists not yet spent began a 
systematic ousting process by taking the 
invaders one by one and hurling them 
through the doorway. This hand to 
hand conflict was kept up for about ten 
minutes when by tacit understanding 
hostilities were brought to a close. The 
victory belonged to the tradesmen and 
they may certainly boast of it for years 
as one of their greatest achievements.
Contrary to expectation the tradesmen 
reasserted their generous natures and 
withdrew with a cheer for their late foes 
for whom they had so great a respect.
The Scientists not to be outdone in 
courtesy gave their conquerors a rous
ing send-off and each party withdrew to 
take stock of their injuries.
Stamm boasts of game leg and a brok
en hat, while the other Scientists mourn 
the soiling of collars and cravats.

The glad hand to all visitors.
This class meets every Sunday 
morning at 9:30 in the East Liberty

apology to the faculty for their share 
in the disturbance.: McCulley, William,

The dual meet with Shadyside last 
Saturday proved that we have much 
good material in school. So come on 
fellows, get out, and bring some athletic 
honors to the school and yourself.
The Plebes were defeated in a seven 
inning game last Wednesday by the 
Shadyside team, the score being 5 to 2.
Judging from the number of students 
that turned out to see the track meet 
and the baseball game last Saturday, the 
school spirit is certainly dead. Wake up.
The Plebe class visited the Jones & 
Laughlin Steel Works last Thursday. 
Much interest ^was shown.
Some of the fellows look worried. 
Never mind you may be allowed to take 
the year ovpr.

The students wish to express their 
sincerest regret to Mr. Lowe upon the 
loss of his mother.
Chief Engineer Weidlein deserves a 
vote of thanks for his kindness.

tions in the current through P. These 
variations in the arc lamp current are 
slight, but suffice to cause rapid varia
tions in the intensity of the arc, which 
correspond exactly with the variations in 
pressure on the carbon transmitter, due 
to the original sound.
When the arc burns brighter and hot
ter the surrounding gases are expanded
ing for its operation upon the fall of 
resistance of Selenium when exposed to 
light. The cell in question has a resist
ance of 30,000 ohms when dark, which 
falls to 2000 ohms when illuminated by 
a 50-candle power lamp.
The current from a 30 volt dry bat
tery is passed through the Selenium re
sistance and an ordinary telephone re^ 
ceiver.
The parallel beam of light from the 
speaking arc is focused upon the Selenand vice versa, giving rise to waves of 
compression and rarefaction which affect 
the ear exactly as would the waves of 
the original sound.
Thus we have a speaking arc, which 
reproduces faithfully the sounds pro
duced before the distant telephone trans
mitter.

The Receiver has for its fundamental 
part, a so-called Selenium cell, dependium cell by a parabolic reflector. The 
variations in light intensify cause varia
tions in the Selenium resistance.
These variations in the resistance of 
the dry battery circuit, cause variations 
in the current through the telephone re
ceiver R, causing it to reproduce the 
sounds generated before the transmitter 
at the sending station.
Photophones have been successfully 
operated across bays and lakes between
stations on either side of valleys 8 or 
10 miles wide.
Although the possibilities of such an 
instrument, especially in a mountainous 
country are very evident, it has as yet 
received no extended practical tests.

PROF. WILLETT IN ECONOMICS.
Fourier, the Socialist, maintained 
that under his system no man would be 
forced to enter any line of industrial 
activity which was objectionable to 
him. Those jobs which to us seem 
most distasteful would be considered 
the most honorable. Thus a man who 
cleaned out cesspools would have the 
most honored position.

A course of landscape gardening has 
evidently been established in the hoys 
school. Great interest is being taken in 
it if we can judge by the beautiful park 
that has been created out of what was 
formerly a mud hole. May they receive 
all the encouragement their genius de
serves.
Miss Munson has left for her home to

On Thursday the A class went out 
to measure poles and for a time had 
quite an audience. Maybe they thought 
we needed some information. They 
finally became useful as coat racks.
On Thursday Miss Harding took the 
day school to the Architectural Hall at 
the Institute and on Friday Miss Merriam took them to the Art Gallery. Both 
visits were very instructive as well as 
interesting and all the classes live in 
hopes of another trip.

MECHANICALS VISIT STEEL 
WORKS.
On Wednesday last the Junior Mech
anicals, in place of the regular laboratory 
work, assembled at the corner of Fif
teenth street and Penn avenue for the 
purpose of visiting the Shoenberger 
works of the American Steel and Wire 
Company.
The party was divided up into four
groups and each group started under the 
quidance of a member of the executive 
staff. The blast furnace, the Bessemer 
converter, and the open hearth furnaces 
were visited in the order named. The 
blooming mill and plate mill were next 
examined, and much interest was shown 
by the students in the engines in the 
mill. One old engine, doing good work 
at the plate rolls, was formerly used 
to propel a steamboat on the river. The 
reversing engine in the blooming mill 
was under the care of Prof. Trinks for 
a short time while he was in active busi
ness life.
