University Center plans
HP
By MATT BUSHEY
Tartan Staffwriter
Ten years after the initial 
plans, the University Center 
remains on the drawing board.
Erik Larson, chair of the Stu
dent Capital Projects Commit
tee, which provides student in
put on the University Center 
project, feels that the Univer
sity Center has gone through so 
many cuts that the-final build
ing will not provide any more
space than is currently avail
able.
The University Center was 
originally budgeted for $76 mil
lion, but has been since cut to 
approximately $45 million. Even 
at'that amount, this is the larg
est fundraising campaign in the 
history of Carnegie Mellon.
According to Larson, the cuts 
have been made during agree
ments between the University 
and the Trustees. The Univer
sity decided what it wants ... 
and the Trustees decided what 
[the University] is willing to 
pay, said Larson. If these two 
ever meet well have a building. 
The University is now facing
increased inflation and construc
tion costs by delaying the con
struction time of the building.
One of the design issues which 
has caused controversy is the 
space for student organizations. 
The plans on file for the Univer
sity Center include a few small 
offices for certain organizations. 
The remaining organizations 
will occupy two large offices. The 
large room will be subdivided 
with lockable office cubicles 
along the walls and a common 
area with computers, a printer, 
and a photocopier in the center. 
Organizations will be able to lock 
up their office cubicle but would

Stearns namedHolocaust debate reaches
Senate resolution 
causes controversy
By BRENDAN McFEELY
Tartan News Editor
At last Tuesday nights meeting of 
Student Senate, a number of resolu
tions were introduced by the Campus 
Affairs committee and adopted by Sen
ate as a whole.
Among these resolutions was a con
troversial one urging the Administra
tion to take certain steps should an old 
Pennsylvania abortion law, which re
quires parental notification by minors 
seeking abortions, be reinstated by an 
upcoming Supreme Court decision; 
another regarding the provision of veg
etarian foods by Dining Service; and a 
third which is a standing rule to supple
ment Senates poster policy.
Campus Affairs committe chair Erik 
Altmann (SCS), responding to sugges
tions by Rebecca Livingston of the Cam
pus Association for Reproductive Rights 
and senior research programmer Scott 
Safier, introduced the resolution con
cerning the Pennsylvania Abortion 
Control Act, which was passed in 1989 
and is about to be reviewed by the U.S. 
Supreme Court. The Abortion Control
Act requires that several steps be taken 
before a woman may abort her preg
nancy, including notification of her 
spouse, or, if a minor, a parent. The Act 
also requires a 24-hour waiting period 
before the operation. The clause re
garding informed parental consent re
quires that a parent be present for the 
lecture mandated to take place during 
the waiting period.
This resolution, the full text of which 
is printed in the Senate minutes (page 
3), urges the Office of Student Affairs to 
provide all students under the age of 
18, particularly incoming freshman 
women, with information about the 
parental consent law and its provision 
for judicial bypass of the law, which 
may not exist in their home states. The 
resolution also urges Student Affairs to 
establish a counseling program for those 
students who may wish to seek a judi
cial bypass. Contrary to rumors now 
circulating around campus, this reso
lution does not urge any expenditure of 
money for the aid of such students 
beyond the establishment of the advo
cacy program.

dean of H&SS
By NATHAN FULLERTON
Tartan Contributing Editor
Professor Peter N. Steams, 
head of Carnegie Mellons His
tory Department, has been ap
pointed Dean of the College of 
Humanities and Social Sci
ences. Stearns, who has 
headed the History Depart
ment since 1986, will take over 
as Dean of H&SS on June 1.
Steams was chosen when 
an H&SS search committee 
comprised of tenured and 
untenured faculty from each 
of H&SSs departments pre
sented Provost Paul Christiano with a short list of candi
dates. The short list was the 
result of a national search 
started last July.
Christiano picked Steams 
because he has done a great 
job with the History Depart
ment.... Its reputation has 
risen tremendously.... He has 
a great interest in undergradu
ate education  he knows 
what good teaching is.
The History Department, 
under Steams leadership, has 
earned distinction for its work 
in social and applied history. 
Steams has lead the way in 
researching such topics as old 
age, masculinity, and emo
tions. .In addition to the 39 
books and more than 70 pa
pers he has published, Steams 
is the founder and editor-inchief of the Journal of Social 
History, and editor of the En
cyclopedia of Social History.
Steams earned his bach
elors, masters, and doctoral 
degrees at Harvard Univer
sity and has been at Carnegie 
Mellon since 1974. He has 
taught more than 20 different 
history courses, including His
tory of Mentalities, Family 
History, Sex and Death, and 
freshman World History. He 
is the Heinz professor of his
tory and the 1992 winner of 
the Elliott Dunlap Smith 
Teaching Award in H&SS.
Steams has chaired numer
ous initiatives on the national 
level and was recently ap
pointed to a National Board 
for Professional Teaching 
Standards committee, which 
will establish standards for 
what high school history and 
social studies teachers should 
know.
Steams takes over as dean 
at a time when H&SS is going 
through some major changes. 
According to Christiano, one 
of H&SSs top priorities is the 
restructuring ofthe H&SS core 
curriculum. I think hes do
ing things to bring a lot of 
excitement to H&SS, said 
Christiano.

This is a political move, not a scholarly one.

under German control, can be found in the 
ads text. 
The essay also disputes the validity of the 
photographs taken at the concentration camps, 
and the papers that document the Nazi policy 
of Jewish extermination. In addition, the ad
vertisement contends that the eyewitness tes
timony is unreliable. It says that the generally 
accepted number of Jewish people killed, 6 
million, is far too high.
The argument also claims that the view
point expressed by CODOH is unpopular be
cause there is a taboo on questioning the 
validity of the Holocaust. Smith said, There is
cally inaccurate, said Mark Weitzman, the 
associate director of educational outreach at 
the Simon Wiesenthal Center. He contends 
that certain aspects of the Holocaust are de
batable, but its existence is incontrovertible.
Statements such as no execution gas cham
bers existed in any camp in Europe whichwas
an irrational prohibition against expres
sion of doubt [about the Holocaust]. 
Smith, who holds a high school di
ploma, admits that the ad is not schol
arly work. He said, Every generation 
revises the history of the generation be
fore. This is nothing unique or unusual 
.... Theres a taboo 
against criticizing the 
documents about the 
Holocaust.
Most people would 
dispute ' Smiths 
claims. Peter Stearns, 
head of the History 
Department, said, 
This is a political 
move, not a scholarly 
one. There is no seri
ous historical ques
tion that millions of 
Jews were killed in 
World War II  de
liberately. Stearns 
said the term revisionist history can be 
understood as historians questioning 
dominant interpretations of events or 
fact in light of new material. [They] use 
the term correctly, but there is no other 
material in this case.
The ad has no validity. No respectable 
historian would think it has any. Steams 
knew of no legitimate research that could 
support any of Smiths claims, and of

In recent months, many college newspa
pers across the country have received an 
advertisement 
from the Committee for Open De
bate on the Holo
caust (CODOH).
This 'committee, 
which consists of 
Bradley R. Smith, 
the ads author, 
and three regional 
directors, Andrew 
Allen, David Cole, 
and Robert Count
ess, states that the 
purpose of 
CODOH is to in
form the Ameri
can public, and specifically college students 
and others in academia, of the other side of 
the Holocaust story.
The ad, the text of which is a lengthy essay 
by Smith, entitled The Holocaust Contro
versy: the Case for Open Debate, which 
basically attempts to refute the existence of 
the Holocaust. Espousing the idea of revi
sionist history, which encourages historians 
to question past events in light of new or 
changing material, CODOH claims that the 
evidence supporting the Holocaust has been 
exaggerated or is false.

Supreme Court hears abortion case this week
WASHINGTON, April 15, (DJ)As 
the Supreme Court takes up another 
abortion case, the'politics of the issue 
have been turned on their head, The 
Wall Street Journal reported.
This Wednesday, the high court hears 
arguments over a Pennsylvania law 
that further chips away at the already 
fragile underpinnings of Roe vs. Wade, 
the 1973 abortion-rights decision. Its 
unlikely that the high court will re
verse Roe vs. Wade before the fall elec
tions. But the collision of abortion law 
and politics this year almost guaran
tees confusion as various groups seek 
to cast the Pennsylvania case to suit 
their own immediate political needs.
Abortion-rights activists, who expect 
to lose the case, are seeking to raise the 
public anxiety level, forecasting that
the case will result in not just another 
legal setback but a cataclysmic defeat. 
The freedom we won will be gone! 
says Kate Michelman, executive direc
tor of the National Abortion Eights 
Action League.
While anti-abortion forces are likely 
to prevail in the case, White House 
strategists are trying to play down its 
political significance. I dont believe 
that it will dramatically increase the 
people who vote one way or another in 
the presidential race, says Robert Tee
ter, chairman of President Bushs reelection campaign. Privately, Bush 
aides fear that abortion could become 
another dangerous variable in the 
Presidents re-election bid.
More than anything, the differing 
views of the Pennsylvania case reflect
the changing political calculus of abor
tion. As the court comes closer and 
closer to reversing Roe, abortion oppo
nents are increasingly on the political 
defensive.
Within Bushs own Republican Party, 
a reversal of Roe would exacerbate a 
looming battle over the partys plat
form, which now calls for a constitu
tional amendment banning abortion. A 
floor fight at the GOP convention in 
August would underscore Bushs lack 
of control over his partys agenda.
Such abortion-rights activists as 
Michelman hope that an atmosphere of 
disaster will rally opposition to Presi
dent Bush and other Republicans. The 
real concern for abortion-rights defend
ers is that the courts ruling on the 
Pennsylvania case, expected in late
June or early July, wont make it clear 
enough that Roe is doomed.
Both sides in the abortion fight bran
dish polls showing that a majority of 
voters favor their position. But Ann 
Stone, a conservative GOP operative 
who heads the fundraising group Re
publicans for Choice, warns that her 
party has the most to lose. If the Su
preme Court is seen as having wiped 
out abortion rights, she says, young 
people, women, and crossover Demo
crats who voted for Bush in 1988 will 
flee the GOP in droves.
It matters, then, not just who wins 
the pending abortion case, but how 
people interpret the decision.
Abortion clinics in Pennsylvania are 
challenging that states restrictions, 
including requirements that doctors
wait 24 hours before performing abor
tions and provide patients with infor
mation designed to discourage them 
from going through with the procedure. 
Although the Supreme Court has twice 
struck down similar regulations, the 
federal appeals court in Philadelphia 
upheld most of the law. Interpreting 
more recent Supreme Court decisions 
as a major retreat from Roe, the lower 
court took the unusual step of announc
ing that the precedent could no longer 
be considered the law of the land.
But the Supreme Court neednt nec
essarily reverseifoe to uphold the Penn
sylvania law. They could take other 
incremental steps by overturning postRoe rulings that struck down regula
tions similar to Pennsylvanias with
out disturbing the 1973 decision.
Opponents criticize Bush
Competitors suggest that an analysis of Bushs 
political history uncovers a serious character flaw
WASHINGTON, April 14, (DJ)  George Bush 
may have his own problems with the character 
issue, The Wall Street Journal reported.
GOP strategists have taken solace in the monthslong battering Bill Clinton has sustained over 
allegations of infidelity, draft evasion, and shad
ing the truth.
But the President is vulnerable to a different 
question: that of his political character. Appar
ently more interested in personal relationships 
than ideas, Bush has consistently been willing to 
mold his public positions to the needs of the 
moment and later discard them under competing 
pressures.
In his 26 years in national politics, Bush has zig
zagged from abortion-rights GOP moderate to 
fervent anti-abortionist, from critic of voodoo 
economics to loyal supporter of Ronald Reagans 
policies, from no new taxes stalwart to propo
nent of tax increases and back again.
Even on foreign policy, his strong suit, he has 
sometimes blown with the wind  postponing a 
trip to Japan under domestic pressure last year, 
for instance, and then awkwardly recasting it as 
a trade mission.
Now, feeling heat from voters upset with the 
status quo, this ultimate Washington insider is 
trying to cast himself as an anti-establishment 
crusader for change on such issues as health care 
which he all but ignored for the first three years 
of his presidency  and regulation, on which he 
lias reversed course.
To Bushs critics, such shifts disclose much 
about the Presidents integrity. Observers who 
are slightly more sympathetic say Bush does not 
deliberately mislead voters about his intentions, 
but they see his attachment to most issues as 
shallow, and suggest he views his job more as 
managing the government than as implementing 
a particular philosophy.
Victor Gold, a veteran Republican speech writer 
who helped Bush write his 1987 autobiography, 
likens his public career to college politics, where 
there were never any issues and election out
comes turned on who seemed most qualified for 
the job in question. James David Barber, the 
Duke University political scientist who is a stu
dent of presidential character, calls Bush an ac
tive-positive executive because of his energetic 
and upbeat style, but says he lacks a coherent 
world view.
Bushs own statements suggest he makes a 
sharp distinction between governing, which he 
plainly enjoys, and campaigning, which he said 
this year would be not very pleasant.
Frederick Khedouri, an investment banker who 
served as Bushs vice presidential deputy chief of 
staff, says, Hes comfortable, usually, with what 
hes saying, but it may be that hes not attaching 
enormous weight to it. Hes aware of the limited 
relevance it has to his actual job.
Even so, that might not be enough in the anti
politics atmosphere of 1992. Already, candidates 
as diverse as Paul Tsongas, Ross Perot, and Patrick 
Buchanan have unexpectedly made an impact by 
offering their own versions of straight talk for a 
weary electorate.
Uttering hard truths in campaign years has 
never been Bushs forte.
Bush is sensitive to the charge of wavering. 
Criticized for policy flip-flops under pressure from 
the conservative Buchanan, the President de
clared last month that life means nothing with
out fidelity to principles.
On the big-picture issues of strong defense, 
engagement abroad, and limited government at 
home, Bush has been remarkably consistent, 
says Martin Anderson, a senior fellow at the 
Hoover Institution who once served as Reagans 
top domestic-policy aide.

TRIPOLI, Libya, April 16, (AP)  The first 
day of international isolation ended with nation
alistic songin the Libyan capitaldisco and rap 
on the city square, school melodies on a theater 
stage, and traditional ballads on television.
There was a mood of defiance all over the 
country as U.N. sanctions took effect this past 
Wednesday. Demonstrators last week have 
shouted support for leader Moammar Gadhafi 
and damnation to the United States.
Meanwhile, about 700 foreign workers fleeing 
Libya arrived in Malta last Thursday aboard the 
first Libyan ship to dock here since U.N. sanc
tions went into effect.
The sanctions, which include a U.N. ban on 
flights in and out of Libya, are aimed at pressur
ing the government of Libyan leader Gadhafi 
into surrendering two Libyans wanted in the 
West for the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over 
Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988.
The sanctions, which do not include sea travel, 
also ban arms sales and call on countries to cut
back Libyan diplomatic staffs.
Libyan television throughout the past few 
days has shown marching crowds waving 
clenched fists and posters of Gadhafi. Banners 
declaring we are ready fluttered in streets.
But the sanctions had no immediate tangible 
effect on the average Libyan. In Tripoli, life was 
normal with regular traffic and busy shops.
In the evening, rallies continued to mark the 
sixth anniversary last week of the U.S. air raid 
on Tripoli and Benghazi in retaliation for the 
terrorist bombing of a Berlin disco. Commemo
ration began Tuesday, and is likely to continue 
for a week.
On April 3, Gadhafi denounced sanctions the 
U.N. Security Council had adopted March 31 
and declared the West was out to destroy Islam.
Libyan television Wednesday carried only fac
tual reports of the imposition of the sanctions. 
Gadhafi didnt appear in public and made no 
public comment on the imposition of the United 
Nations sanctions.

 Former Soviet President 
Mikhail Gorbachev ordered 
state-run media to avoid critical 
reporting on the 1986 Chernobyl 
nuclear plant explosion shortly 
after the disaster, according to 
secret documents.
The report and memos from 
the once-powerful Communist 
Party Politburo, appearing yes
terday in Pravda Ukrainy, indi
cated that Soviet leaders were 
informed of the scope of the di
saster, but distorted the infor
mation reaching the public.
The top secret report published 
yesterday was signed by Gor
bachev, who at the time was the
countrys leader as general sec
retary of the Communist Party.
Many of these facts were kept 
from the public at the time of the 
accident.
In a resolution dated May 29, 
1986, a month after the explo
sion, Gorbachev ordered the 
state-run media to stop concen
trating on the causes of the acci
dent and to find positive aspects 
of the clean-up.
Gorbachev instructed state 
television, the state news agency 
Tass, and other organs of the 
central press to devote more at
tention to such things as the 
patriotism of workers involved 
in the clean-up and the conditions of those who were evacu
ated.
The Ukrainian newspaper did 
not say how it acquired the pre
viously secret documents.
The April 26,1986 explosion 
at the power station was the 
worlds worst atomic accident. 
Soviet authorities claimed only 
31 or 32 people died.
Western experts say any
where from 500 to 7,000 people 
have died from cancer or radia
tion-related illness.

tion; and,
Whereas, this law will apply 
to those female students at Car
negie Mellon who are under 18

In last weeks issue, the Kappa Sigma booth was inadvertently omitted from the story 
Fraternities strut their stuff.
Last week, the Society of the Prow and SDC booths were inadvertently omitted from the story 
Independent booths fair well.
The Tartan apologizes to Kappa Sigma, Society of the Prow, and SDC.

Holocaust debate hits 
college campuses
CODOH, from page 1
dered is much higher than 6 million. The 
advertisement appears to be an effort by 
[CODOH] to find a way to discredit and 
attack Jews, said Steams.
Rabbi Joseph H. Levine, director of Bnai 
Brith Hillel at CMU, who teaches two 
courses on the Holocaust at CMU, called 
the ad and its claims a desecration to the 
memory of those who perished. Levine 
said that the ad uses a type of circular logic 
to make itself appear legitimate. To throw 
into doubt a tragedy that is so massively 
documented compounds the tragedy, said 
Levine.
The ad has stirred up controversy on the 
college campuses that it has reached. Many 
student newspapers have refused to run 
the ad in any form. Others have run it as 
an advertisement or an editorial piece, 
some have written editorials on it, and 
others have done both.
Duke printed the piece as an advertise
ment. Northwestern and Cornell have run 
the ad in some form. Rutgers ran the essay 
as an editorial piece and surrounded it 
with rebuttals. Harvard, Yale, Brown, Uni
versity of Pennsylvania, and University of 
Southern California have refused to run 
the ad.
I dont understand why the ad is so 
controversial on campuses where free ex
change of ideas would be taken for granted, 
said Smith. He also said that he has heard
from the college papers that the Holo
caust cannot be debated and that he does 
not understand why it as an historical 
event cannot be questioned.
Many student newspaper editorial 
boards, both those who have run the ad 
and those who havent, agree that this is 
not an issue of free speech, because Smith 
is not being prevented from disseminat
ing his viewpoint.
Most student newspapers reserve the 
right to refuse any advertisement. Some 
have not run the ad citing the historical 
inaccuracies. Others decided not to run it 
because they felt that it is not a freespeech issue. Some who ran the ad felt 
that it was the newspapers duty to in
form the campus community of these types 
of opinions. Karen Kaplan, the executive 
editor of the MIT Tech , explained that 
they did not run the ad, but did write an 
editorial column about it because, Its 
not open debate, its propaganda.
Even when The Holocaust Controversy: 
the Case for Open Debate has been sent 
to all the colleges and universities on 
CODOHs list, Smith wont be finished. 
According to information from staffers of 
the Harvard Crimson and Dukes The 
Chronicle, a second ad by CODOH has 
begun to make the rounds.
(Tartan Editor-in-Chief Heidi Hoover 
contributed to this article.)
No subject enrages campus Thought Police more than Holocaust Revisionism. We 
debate every other great historical issue as a matter of course, but influential pressure 
groups with private agendas have made the Holocaust story an exception. Elitist dogma 
manipulated by special interest groups corrupts everything in academia. Students should 
be encouraged to investigate the Holocaust story the same way they are encouraged to 
investigate every other historical event. This isnt a radical point of view. The premises for 
it were worked out centuries ago during a little something called the Enlightenment.
The influence of Holocaust Revisionism is growing steadily both here and abroad. In 
the United States, Revisionism was launched in earnest in 1977 with the publication of the 
book The Hoax of the Twentieth Century by Arthur R. Butz. Professor Butz teaches 
electrical engineering and computer sciences at Northwestern University in Evanston, 
Illinois.
Those who take up the Revisionist cause represent a wide spectrum of political and 
philosophical positions. They are certainly not the scoundrels, liars and demons the 
Holocaust Lobby tries to make them out to be. The fact is, there are no demons in the real 
world. People are at their worst when they begin to see their opponents as an embodiment 
of evil, and then begin to demonize them. Such people are preparing to do something simply 
awful to their opponents. Their logic is that you can do anything you want to a demon.
That logic will not succeed.

share this central area.
This plan is modeled after a 
similar scheme currently used 
at the University of Pittsburgh. 
However, the Capital Projects 
Committee feels that organiza
tions should not be forced to in
teract with each 
other. Can you 
imagine during 
Carnival time any
one wanting to be 
in this
office?...Groups 
like FRINGE and 
Pioneers dont 
want to discuss 
their booth design 
right next to each 
other, said Larson.
Another contro
versial aspect is the 
dining area. Cur
rent plans call for 
the dining area to 
look out over the 
pool. People sitting 
in the cafeteria 
would look through 
a glass partition 
onto the pool one floor below. 
There is also a balcony planned 
for above the pool for viewers of 
swimming events, which will 
only be accessible through the 
dining area.
Critics complained that people 
eating in the dining area would 
be watching sweaty athletes and 
smelling chlorine. The design
ers affirmed that the pool area 
would be pressurized at a lower 
level to prevent the escape of 
pool air into the adjoining din
ing area.
A similar situation occurs in 
another dining area that is bor
dered by a two gyms, a weight 
room and squash courts on the 
other side. The dining area looks 
over the large gym one floor be
low. On the opposite side, ath

sections: a public area that runs 
through the building with an 
entrance courtyard; a commons 
area; a ballroom and an audito

area and the student organizaThe Evolution of the University Center

the dining area to circulate be
tween the courts, gyms, and 
stairs that lead to the locker 
rooms below. The intent of this 
is to increase the visibility of 
athletics at CMU.
The University Center will 
provide much better athletic fa
cilities, said Larson, and will be 
the home of IM athletics and 
varsity swimming. The old gym 
is slated to be remodelled for 
intercollegiate sports.
The University Center buildtion space is located on the other.
A bookstore is planned for the 
main and lower levels which will 
incorporate the art store, the 
Carnegie Shoppe and university 
textbooks. The bookstore in 
Baker Hall would possibly be 
maintained as a store for plea
sure reading.
The project designers of the 
University Center are Michel 
Dennis Associates, an architec
ture firm locatedin Boston. They 
won the competition for the 
University Master Plan in 1987 
which includes Gesling Stadium 
and Resnik and West Wing 
dorms. Urban Design 
Associates (UDA) is also 
involved in the Univer
sity Center design.
Michel Dennis Asso
ciates is also responsible 
for the design of the 
Center for the Arts, 
which will house work
rooms and classrooms 
for the drama and mu
sic departments as well 
as an art gallery.
It has been ten years 
since the initial propos
als for the University 
Center were made, and 
in Larsons opinion, it 
will be at least five years 
before the building is 
completed. I think it 
will be ten years out of 
date for the campus, said 
Larson. It was once an incred
ible idea. Now its something 
they just have to get done. The 
final drawings will be finished 
within the next month, but the 
University is still waiting for a 
major donor.

New resolutions passed
RESOLUTIONS, from page 1
The main opposition to the 
resolution was produced by 
H&SS sophomore Patrick 
Mooney. In his address on the 
subject, Mooney asserted that 
senate has demonstrated that 
it should not deal with poli
tics, referring to the both this 
resolution and the ROTC dis
crimination resolution of last 
semester. When asked later to 
qualify this statement, 
Mooney said, Student Senate 
is elected to allocate the Ac
tivities Fee. This, asserts 
Mooney, does not entitle the 
Senate to engage in the de
bate of specific political issues.
In response, MCS Senator 
Michael Tomblyn said that the 
resolution was apolitical. All 
[the resolution] is, is asking 
Student Affairs to do its job, 
said Tomblyn.
Altmann also replied to this,
saying, The resolution ad
dresses the welfare of CMU 
students, which is what Sen
ate is supposed to do. If politi
cal statements emerge 
through Senate carrying out 
its responsibility, then so be 
it.
A second resolution urged 
CMDS to take certain steps 
in order to satisfy the needs 
of its vegetarian and vegan 
customers. Vegans are veg
etarians who do not eat any 
animal byproducts, including 
meat, eggs, and honey.
The final resolution re
sulted in a standing rule, 
which takes effect immedi
ately, and will be part of the 
new poster policy when it is 
enacted. The standing rule 
dictates that postering the 
windows over the front en
trance of Doherty Hall will 
no longer be permitted.
Time and money:
a powerful combination to help 
stop urgent problems in our 
community from growing.

Crime and Incident Report
4/10 DISORDERLY CON
DUCT, 10:22 pm. While a Cam
pus Police officer was on the 
Midway, a CMU student re
moved the officers hat to enter
tain his friends. The student was 
placed under arrest and issued 
an internal citation for disor
derly conduct.
4/11 ASSAULT, 2:24 am. A 
Duquesne student reported to 
Campus Police that she and her 
roommate were verbally abused 
by two male CMU students, and 
that one of the men punched her 
in the face. The women met the 
two CMU students at one of the 
fraternities and the men invited 
them back to their room in 
MorewoodGardensaround2am. 
Initially, the women declined so 
they could catch the 2 am shuttle 
back to Duquesne, but they fi
nally agreed to stop by for a few 
minutes and talk. As soon as 
they entered the room, one of 
the men turned the lights off at 
which point the women became 
defensive and accused the men 
of just luring them to their 
apartment for whatever they 
could get. The one man, identi
fied only as Chris, became an
gry andattackedthe women with 
sexually obscene language at 
which point the Duquesne stu
dent reporting the incident 
slapped Chris in the face. Chris 
then dumped beer on both 
women and punched the victim 
in the face. The women left the 
room and reported the incident 
to Campus Police. The student 
said she didnt want to press 
charges, but just wanted Cam
pus Police to be aware of the 
situation. Campus Police 
checked the apartment, but no 
one answered the door.
4/11 LIQUOR VIOLATION,
1:13 pm. Campus Police officers 
conducted a beverage check of a 
Midway booth worker. The

LaPaglia responded. There was 
no evidence of marijuana, but 
LaPaglia did observe the three 
men described by the security 
supervisor. One of the men took 
out a lighter and began to set 
posters on fire. LaPaglia ap
proached, identified himself as 
a police officer, and ordered the 
man to put the fire out. The man 
tried to walk away, at which 
point LaPaglia grabbed the 
mans jacket. A fight ensued, 
but additional officers arrived 
on the scene and the man was 
handcuffed and taken to Cam
pus Police headquarters. One of 
the other men requested to ac
company his friend to the sta
tion, and was told that he would 
be subject to a weapons check. 
He agreed, and the check re
vealed a knife. The second man 
was placed under arrest for pro
hibited offensive weapons.
4/11 DISORDERLY CON
DUCT, 9:21 pm. A visitor to 
campus reported to Campus 
Police that projectiles were 
thrown out of a Morewood ETower window, almost hitting 
him and his wife. The man 
pointed out the window from 
which he believed the projec
tiles (possibly bottles) were 
thrown. The officers went to the 
room and spoke to an occupant 
who said that some items were 
thrown out of the window as a 
result of horseplay, but none 
were intended to hit anyone, and 
no bottles were involved. An in
ternal citation was issued and 
will be forwarded to the Hous
ing Office through Student Af
fairs.
4/11 DISORDERLY CON
DUCT, 9:51 pm. A CMU stu
dent reported that someone had 
thrown beer bottles from the roof 
of one of the fraternities, strik
ing himself and his girlfriend. 
The students girlfriend, who 
received a cut from the bottle, 
refused medical attention. The 
officer spoke to the president of 
the fraternity, who said he was 
unaware of what happened and 
said it would not happen again.
4/11 THEFT, 10:30pm. While
riding the Gravitron, a CMU 
student discovered that his wal
let was missing. The student 
notified Carnival personnel and 
asked them to turn the wallet in 
to Campus Police if it was found. 
Later, the student found that 
his wallet was turned in to the 
Escort office. All the contents 
were present, except for $15.
4/12 INDECENT EXPO
SURE, 3:45 am. A Campus Po
lice officer observed a man walk
ing on the Morewood sidewalk 
with his shorts pulled down to 
his ankles. The man walked into 
the middle of the street in this 
condition. Upon sighting the 
patrol car, he ran unchallenged 
into one of the fraternities and 
disappeared. The house was is
sued an internal citation for open 
lewdness.
4/12 CRIMINAL MIS
CHIEF, 6 am. A Campus Police 
officer radioed that there was a 
loud noise coming from More
wood Avenue, and that she saw 
approximately eight to 10 men 
run into one of the fraternities. 
The officer then saw a red jeep 
lying on its side on the lawn of 
another fraternity. The officer 
also noticed someone peeping 
out from behind the shades of 
the fraternity into which the men 
had run. Because of the danger
ous position of the vehicle, which 
had gas and other fluids run
ning out of it, a second officer on 
the scene attempted to get some
one from that house to help move 
the vehicle. After approximately 
15 minutes of knocking on the 
door, the officers entered and 
questioned the fraternity mem
bers. The fratemtiy members 
accused the officers of spying 
on their house and it was clear 
they were not going to be coop
erative or right the vehicle. The 
owner of the vehicle was noti
fied, and the incident was re
ported to Pat Hamed.
4/13 THEFT, 12:19 am. A 
former CMU student entered the 
Campus Police station and 
stated that someone had re

4/13 ACCIDENT, 10:47 am. 
While taking empty boxes to the 
compactor located at the Skibo 
loading dock, an Entropy em
ployee became pinned against a 
wall by racks of Dining Service 
equipment stored in the hall
way.
The employee was freed, and 
reported that she felt fine other 
than being a little shook up.
4/13 MEDICAL, 6:52 pm. The 
Campus Police were notified that 
a person had fainted in the Caber 
Club. Upon arrival, the respond
ing officers found the man, a 
CMU graduate student, talking 
to his wife. While the officers 
were talking to the man and his 
wife, he fainted again, at which 
time a student EMS worker ar
rived. The EMS volunteer rec
ommended that the student go 
to the hospital, but he signed a 
waiver refusing medical escort.
4/13 ASSAULT, 10:20 pm. A 
CMU student was walking on 
Morewood Avenue when a white 
Buick Century with Ohio plates 
pulled alongside him. Three men 
got out of the car; one of them 
said, Lets get him, and the 
men attacked the student. Sev
eral SAE brothers who wit
nessed the scene came to the aid 
of the student, and the men got 
back in the car and drove away. 
The vehicle description was ra
dioed to Pittsburgh police, and 
the student was offered trans
portation to the hospital, which 
he refused.
4/14 LOST PROPERTY, A
CMU student reported that he 
lost his passport in the Shadyside area approximately a week 
ago.
The student was advised that 
he needed to file a police report 
to obtain a replacement.
4/15 THEFT, 10:46 am. A 
CMU student reported that, be
tween noon on April 10 and 1 pm 
on April 12, an unknown 
person(s) had entered the Phi 
Mu Alpha room in the College of 
Fine Arts and removed a clari
net and its carrying case. The 
student had signed the instru
ment out from a CMU professor 
and was storing it in the Phi Mu 
Alpha room between classes. The 
man said that he did not report 
the incident immediately be
cause he wanted to check if any 
other student had borrowed the 
clarinet without notifying him.
4/15 ASSAULT, 2:12 pm. A 
CMU student was asleep in her 
unlocked room when a man en
tered and sexually assaulted her. 
When she awoke and fought her 
attacker, the man fled the room. 
The student then called a friend 
who called Campus Police. The 
attacker was described as a 
white male with long brown hair 
and a goatee. At the time of the 
assault, the attacker had the 
smell of alcohol on his breath.

Letters to the Editor
Knauers actions are 
considered controversial
Editor:
In the April 13 is
sue of The Tartan
[page 1], there was a Letter tO 
very disturbing picth Edjtf)r 
ture of a student caru,c CU,lUI 
rying a sign that said, The Pope Is ProChoice. Perhaps the student holding 
the sign, Josh Rnauer, thinks that 
such a sign is funny and in good humor. 
I think otherwise. Does Knauer really 
believe the Pope is a supporter of abor
tion? If he does think that, I would like 
to know why. Ever since the founding 
of the Church, its doctrine has consis
tently denounced abortion for any rea
son. I cannot find any reason why 
Knauer would make such a statement, 
except to express his anti-Catholic sen
timents to the rest of the world.
Further, was it the intent of Knauer 
to indirectly say that among Christian 
denominations only the Catholic 
Church opposes abortion? If so, it ap
pears that Knauer only seeks to per
petuate the lie that only Catholics who 
listen to the Churchs leader, the Pope, 
are pro-life. Southern Baptists, Fun
damentalists, Lutherans', and Free 
Methodists are but a few of the other 
churches that are pro-life. Orthodox 
Judaism is also pro-life.
Is the guiding force behind the pro
abortion movement one of anti-Catholi
cism? Knauers sign certainly smacks 
of such sentiments. How great of a help 
is it to the pro-abortion movement to 
attack religious leaders? Perhaps it is 
just I who feels it diminishes the cred
ibility of their movement, not to men
tion that it makes the bearer of the sign 
appear insensitive to the freedom of 
religion granted by our constitution.
While respecting the right to free
dom of speech and assembly, I find the 
sign itself and the publication of the 
picture offensive. Such action on the 
part of Knauer is inexcusable and the 
publication of the picture in The Tar
tan insensitive. Both acts warrant an 
apology to all Catholics and pro-lifers.

Reader says that the 
Pope is not pro-choice
Editor:
I would like to clear 
up any misunderstanding CMU stuLetter tO 
dents might have Friitnr
aboutthePopesstand cailor
on abortion. The photo included with 
the article covering the pro-choice rally 
showed a student carrying a sign which 
said, The Pope is pro-choice.
Although the Pope says that he thinks 
freedom of choice is desirable and good, 
he also says that we have to choose 
responsibly  and the responsible 
choice is life. The Pope is cited many 
times as speaking directly against abor
tion. In June 1989, he said, The dig
nity of the person can be protected only 
if the person is considered as inviolable 
from the moment of conception until 
natural death. (LOsservatoreRomano, 
June 19, 1989).
I think it is important to distinguish 
between pro-choice * and pro-abortion. The literal meaning of pro-choice
is to be in favor of the freedom to choose. 
Freedom of choice is one of the prin
ciples our nation was founded on. I 
think it is safe to say that the Pope as 
well as almost every American is prochoice in that sense. People in favor of 
abortion, however, have coined the 
phrase pro-choice to have the same 
meaning as pro-abortion. The Pope 
does not see the fetus as a choice  he 
sees it as a person, deserving the same 
respect and protection under the law as 
the rest of us.

Is Restifo forgetting the 
third party in the issue?
Letter to the Editor
Editor:
In response to 
Chris Restifos article 
in last weeks Tartan,
I would like to say 
[that] Restifo seems 
to have forgotten the innocent victim; 
the baby!
A pregnant woman may have to carry 
a baby to term, but the alternative is 
much worse because it ends a life. 
Restifo seems to think pro-life volun
teers are working against pregnant 
women. This is simply not true. The 
pro-life movement is trying to save the 
lives of innocent babies. Pro-life work
ers will do all they can to help a preg
nant woman choose a humane option.
I place emphasis on human life over 
the convenience of a pregnant woman. 
There are alternatives to ending an 
innocent life.

Carnival issue claimed 
less than desireable
Editor:
The Tartan has 
been a good newspa
per in the past, but Letter to 
recently its quality The PHi+ni' has sunk below acCUIlur
ceptable levels. Here are some examples 
from last weeks issue:
Why were the results of the Student 
Senate elections not printed until April 
13? Surely the results were available 
for the April 6 issue, since the elections 
were before Spring Break. And did The 
Tartan think that a scandal headline 
about fraternity posters degrading 
women should take precedence over 
election results?
Why was there a letter to the editor 
from an individual in Michigan implor
ing students to take up the Croatian 
cause in Yugoslavia? Letters to the 
editor should at least have some bear
ing on the university; let political orga
nizations either pay for advertisement 
or poster on bboards around campus. I 
dont want my Activities Fee paying to 
plug them.
Why was Spring Carnival coverage 
so poor? Did anyone bother to tell The 
Tartan who won Booth this year? Why 
were there half of a page about which 
Midway ride made you vomit more and 
only a couple of paragraphs about the 
booths and buggies? Why were there so 
few pictures, and why were there mul
tiple pictures of some organizations and 
no photos at all of others? A lot of
people would be happy to see their hard 
work rewarded with at least a picture 
in the paper (ditto for Greek Sing cover
age). Where was a table of Buggy 
results? Times of heats were listed, but 
that isnt a table of results. If I wanted 
to know what place some team came in, 
I might waste the time to compare their 
heat with everyone elses, but there 
were six teams with no times at all. 
Were they DQed, did they get rerolls, or 
did they all tie for first place?
But The Tartan isnt the only one 
whose quality has dropped. I would 
also like to note that the Buggy Book 
this year was inexcusably poorly done. 
It would have been nice if there would 
have been half as many pictures in it as 
there were misspelled names and gram
matical errors.
So, editors and staff: why not try to 
improve things a little in the future and 
show a little pride in your work? It 
would show that we really are intelli
gent students at a fine university, ca
pable of doing a professional job.

Resolutions passed 
without publicity
Letter to the Editor
Editor:
Help! Im unin
formed! I dont often 
attend Student Sen
ate meetings, and I 
dont participate in 
the flame wars that rage on the campus 
network. Im not as familiar as some 
with the intimate ins and outs of cam
pus politics, although I have voted in 
every Senate election since coming to 
CMU, and I look over the Student Sen
ate minutes in The Tartan almost ev
ery week. Like the vast majority of 
students here, I didnt know Senate 
was even considering the ROTC resolu
tion last fall until after it was actually 
passed and then reported in The Tar
tan. I was really bothered by the fact 
that Student Senate would even con
sider action on such a highly sensitive 
and controversial topic without mak
ing the matter open to a truly public 
debate. The fallout last year demon
strated that a lot of people were both
ered the same way.
Now I have heard a rumor that Sen
ate recently passed a resolution on an
other highly controversial topic: abor
tion. According to this rumor, our stu
dent Activities Fee is to pay the legal 
expenses of any pregnant student un
der eighteen who wants an abortion 
but whose parents wont give their con
sent under the law.
Has anyone else heard about this? I 
hope that Senate has not again passed 
its own judgment on a politically sensi
tive topic without the publicity and 
open debate we should reasonably ex
pect. What is going on?
As uninformed as I am, I know my 
proper course should have been to ask 
my Senators about the facts before pub
licly fueling a rumor that might not 
have a grain of truth in it. However, for 
the benefit of any other students who 
might feel as uninformed as I do about 
campus politics, Im asking here. Is this 
just a cock-and-bull story Ive heard, or 
did Senate again do something it might

Ad spreads lies
Upon receiving Bradley Smiths 
advertisement The Holocaust Con
troversy: The Case for Open De
bate, a piece claiming that the 
murder of six million Jews and other 
minority groups never happened, 
we joined many other university 
newspapers in dealing with a difficultissue. Should we acceptSmiths 
work and run it as an ad or an 
editorial column? Should we ignore 
it altogether? Or should we address 
his misinformation and let our read
ers know that views such as Smiths 
exist? We chose the latter for sev
eral reasons:
 What the ad says is a blatant lie. 
Many points about the Holocaust 
are debatable, but the fact that the 
Holocaust happened is not open for 
debate. The survivors and eyewit
nesses horrifying tales and visual 
evidence confirm that deliberate 
genocide did ravage the Jewish 
population. Saying the Holocaust 
never happened is equivalent to 
saying that there was no slavery in 
the U.S. We will not stand behind 
such falsities.
 The ad does not encourage any 
sort of debate. There is no open 
debate at all in Smiths essay. In 
the cover letter for the ad, Smith 
states that the sole purpose of the 
Committee for Open Debate on the 
Holocaust is to inform the Ameri
can public, and specifically college 
students and others in academia, of 
the other side of the Holocaust 
story.
When the word debate is in
volved, one expects to see two views 
presented and be able to assess both 
and formulate some sort of opinion. 
Only one view is present in The 
Holocaust Controversy: The Case 
for Open Debate. Smith presents 
only one side of the argument, leav
ing no room for the other.
 The motives behind the ad are 
bigoted. Smiths background in
volvement with organizations such 
as the Institute for Historical Re
view  an anti-Semitic and racist 
organization  leave many doubts 
as to how unbiased his essay on 
the nonexistence of the Holocaust 
can be.
 The ad does not deserve 
legitimization. By printing the ad 
in its full form, we would be saying 
it is just as likely to be true as any 
rebuttals we printed with it, which 
is not the case.
Smith believes that his views 
should be disseminated to the pub
lic under the First Amendment 
guarantee of free speech. We arent 
keeping Smith and his Committee 
for Open Debate on the Holocaust 
from expressing themselves, but we 
arent going to help them. Were 
exercising our right to refuse any ad 
for print. Because of our concerns 
about the contents of the ad, we 
believe that these views should be 
addressed .
We chose to write a news story as 
a means of informing the campus 
community of the lies and antiSemitism that exist in our society. 
We believe a news story is the best 
medium in which to present Smiths 
views because it doesnt allow 
Smiths lies to stand on their own 
and ha ve the ability to unduly influ
ence those uninformed about the 
Holocaust.
The graphic associated with the 
news article displays excerpts from 
Smiths ad in order to show the 
smooth and convincing way in which 
he attacks the truth of the Holo
caust. It is his use of language that 
might attract uninformed readers 
attention.
We encourage people to learn more 
about the Holocaust and its conse
quences. Books such as The Holo
caust by Tumowsky, Children With 
a Star by Deborah Dwork, and The 
Pictorial History of the Holocaust 
edited by Yitzchak Arad are avail
able at Hunt Library. There are 
also books put on reserve by Rabbi 
Joseph Levine, director of CMU 
Hillel.
Professors in the History Depart
ment and other departments could 
also be a resource for those who 
wish to discuss the Holocaust or 
have questions about it.
We hope students will approach 
this sensitive topic in a manner 
which will allow them to uncover 
the facts.
Ethics questioned
At last Tuesdays Senate meet
ing, Senator Michael Loomis (GSIA) 
half-seriously proposed a resolution 
which, if passed, would have offered 
Senates sympathy to SAE for hav
ing to deal with advocates of intol
erance  women from Chatham 
protesting an SAE party poster  
during Carnival. (The full text of 
the resolution is in Senates min
utes, p. 3.) To Senates credit, it 
struck down the resolution without 
discussion. A moment later, Sena
tor Joshua Knauer (H&SS) moved 
that the resolution be expunged from 
the minutes. The motion was de
feated after debate, again to Senates 
credit.
While Senate took the responsible 
course of action in both cases, we 
are disgusted that Senate needed to 
take action at all. Loomis has the 
right to express his opinion. How
ever, a Senate resolution is not the 
place for a half-serious idea. Fur
thermore, the women protesting had 
every right to protest in the manner 
they chose, and they had a right to 
be angry.
A poster showing a mermaid per
forming fellatio on a whale is sexist 
because of the portrayal of the 
woman (mermaid) purely as a sexual 
object and because she is shown as 
subordinate to the man (whale). This 
poster is one that went too far and 
drew negative reaction, but its im
pact comes partly because it ap
pears in the context of a fraternity 
culture where party slogans like
they said shed never go down or 
hunt for head at XXX, and posters 
that habitually portray women in 
various stages of undress are the 
norm.
The fact that Loomis doesnt un
derstand what is sexist about SAEs 
Thar she blows!!! party poster 
troubles us, because it is indicative 
of a general insensitivity on this 
campus toward sexism. Not only 
did he not see the offense to women 
in the poster, but compounded it by 
presenting a resolution to Senate 
accusing the protestors of puritanism and intolerance. A more re
sponsible course of action for him to 
have taken might have been to talk 
to women who were offended by the 
poster and try to understand why. 
As a Senator, thats the sort of ex
ample he should be setting for his 
constituents.
Knauers motion to expunge 
Loomiss resolution from the min
utes of the Senate meeting was un
ethical. Loomis should never have 
proposed his resolution, but he did, 
and the indiscretions of Senators, if 
they occur in the course of an official 
Senate proceeding, should not be 
hidden from the rest of the CMU 
community.
This incident adds to recent ethi
cal problems weve seen in Student 
Senate. Its only a few Senators 
making the rest look bad, and we 
call on those Senators who are ethi
cal to pressure their colleagues to
ward appropriate behavior.
THE HOLOCAUST CONTROVERSY:
The Case For Open Debate
By Bradley R SmithIWSk
THE CONTEMPORARV ISSUE
No subject enrages camp* Thought Po< 
lice more than Holocaust Revisionism. We deI bale every other great historical issue as a mat1 ter of course, but Influential pressure groups with 
| private agendas have made the Holocaust story 
an exception. Elitist dogma manipulated by speI dal Interest groups corrupts everything in acade
mia. Students should be encouraged to investi
gate the Holocaust story the same way they are 
encouraged to investigate every other historical 
event This isnt a radical point of view. The 
premises for it were worked out centuries ago 
during a Ittie something caBod the Enftghtenmont.
1 heard a desperate scream from behind the barbed 
wire. 1 quickly turned and saw an S.S. man just 
inside the fence savagely beating a Jew with a 
wooden club. The Jew was middicaged, with a short 
beard covered with blood. A young man broke away 
from a group standing huddled nearby and rushed.., 
to shield the older man, but soon his face was also 
running with blood. The S.S. man ordered the Jews 
who witnessed the beating to lift the bleeding man 
on their shoulders and dance through the camp 
grounds.
 Jacob Celemenski, from ''With My 
Martyred People'
Revisionists part company with establishrioni historian* in that Revisioniste deny that the 
Serman State had a policy to exterminate the 
Jewish people (or anyone else) by putting them to 
ieath in gas chambers or by killing them through 
sbuse or neglect. Revisionists also maintain that 
he figure of 6 million Jewish deaths is an Irre
sponsible exaggeration, and that no execution 
jas chambers existed In any camp In Europe 
which was under German cont/d. Fumigation 
jas chambers did exist to delouse doming and 
K^uipmem to prevent disease at the camps. It Is 
/ery likely that It was from this e-savfng proce
dure that the myth of extermination gas chamjo rs emerged.
We got used to undeserved slaps, blows and 
executions. We got accustomed to seeing people die 
in their own excrement, to seeing pilcd-up coffins 
full of corpses, to seeing the sick amidst dirt and 
filth and to seeing the helpless doctors. We got

THE TARNA2 1 0AR2EthE iEssu2 1 rd ayRhs .SSrPornography Act causes controversy
(Hxa
Christian M. Restifo
How many people out there have read 
anything by Thomas Hardy, James 
Joyce, Ernest Hemingway, 
Geoffrey Chaucer, F. Scott 
Fitzgerald, D. H. Lawrence, J. D. 
Salinger, or Virginia Woolf?
These people are considered some 
of the greatest writers in the 
world. In their times, they were 
also considered some of the filthi
est and most pornographic. Why, 
then, do we read them? Why do 
people today laugh or give strange 
looks when you mention that 
these writers were banned in 
some places?
Did you know that if the Por
nography Victims Compensation 
Act, currently under review by 
the Senate Judiciary Committee, 
is passed, a person who is raped 
can sue the modem day publish
ers of the works? In fact, she can 
sue not only the publishers, but 
also the distributors and the book 
stores that carry them. All the 
woman has to do is show that a 
particular work was pornographic 
and that it influenced her assail
ant.
It seems that some Republicans, 
family value groups, feminists, 
and anti-pornography groups be
lieve that pornography is the main 
cause of rape and sexual assault 
of women and children. According 
to them, pornography advocates 
the systematized degradation and 
abuse of women. It denies them 
equal rights and encourages rapists.
To fight this societal evil, they think it 
necessary to create a bill that allows civil 
recourse to those who feel they have 
been directly or indirectly oppressed by
pornography. The system follows this 
logic:
A man reads or views some pornogra
phy. In it he sees women and children 
being treated as sexual objects. This 
inspires him to go out and rape a woman 
or molest a child.
The woman decides to take action.
if there were no criminal charges, por
nography influenced the man, and the 
distributor was the one who provided the 
material.
The proof that supporters of the bill 
provide is common sense. They say 
there is a direct cause-and-effect rela
tionship between pornography and
Since the distributors are obviously re
sponsible for the actions of the rapist 
because they provided him with the in
spiration, the woman deserves com
pensation from them. She merely has to 
prove that a sexual crime occurred, even
sexual crimes against women and chil
dren. Other than that, no statistics or 
well-known studies are provided.
Now the scary thing about this whole 
issue is not pornography. It is not the 
amount of violence that women and children suffer at the hands of men, which is a 
great deal. It is not even the concept of 
obscenity. The scary thing is that support
ers of the Pornography Victims Compensa
tion Act are laying the foundation for the 
destruction of the First Amendment by 
economic means.
Those who support this bill are blind to 
several important issues. 
Namely, they are the con
cepts of obscenity and por
nography, the laying of 
blame for a crime, and the 
freedom of expression.
First, just whatis obscene 
and pornographic? Some 
supporters of the bill be
lieve that Playboy is pom. 
Andrea Dworkin, who was 
one of the authors of the 
MacKinon-Dworkin Act, 
believes that the definition 
of pornography in the bill 
is not broad enough. To her, 
anything that sexually sub
ordinates women is pom.
This type of logic is com
plete and utter nonsense. 
These people are just at
tempting to use a vague 
definition so that anyone 
can sue publishers and the 
like. Under this bill, you 
can call just about any ref
erence to sex obscene and 
degrading to women. For 
example, if I show you a 
film in which the woman is 
physically beneath the 
man or says a vulgar com
ment about herself, I can 
call that degrading to 
women. You just have to 
completely disregard the 
fact that the woman was a willing partici
pant.
Dont forget, though, that the definition 
of obscenity is based upon community 
standards. So, if Im a publisher of pomogPlease see OBSCENITY, page 9

Excerpts from letter 
to Dean of Students
Editor:onI am in
censed at the 
recent flyers Lstter tO 
for a male sex
ist blowout1 
sponsored by Pi Lambda Phi. I 
did not see the SAE poster that 
was the issue of the Chatham 
students protest.
I finally realize why, for the 
first time in my life, I have had 
to be defensive about being male. 
I finally realize why there is 
such a polarization betweenmen 
and women on this campus. If 
the men on this campus are char
acterized by the likes of those 
who posted these flyers, who 
claim to have the highest QPA of 
all the fraternities (according to 
The Word 1990-91), its no won
der they must rely on a complete 
lack of taste to invite people to 
their social functions. However, 
I do question why they should 
pursue such a strategy to en
hance their social lives. Do they 
think they will be able to attract 
women of minimal literacy to 
such social functions?
I thought that CMU, as an 
institution of higher learning, 
strove to turn out the besttrained professionals without 
losing sight of the larger goal of 
education. The word education 
has its roots in the Latin, ex, 
meaning out of, and ducere, to 
lead. Any educational 
institutions mission is then to 
lead one out, out of darkness, 
out of ignorance. It would seem 
that certain individuals, namely 
those at this fraternity, have 
only been led back to the Dark 
Ages.
Men in fraternities implicitly 
take on a leadership role. They 
are the most visible, they lay 
claim to goals, interests, and 
values that are common to them
selves.
The University rightly sup
ports the development of such 
fellowship and brotherhood (and 
sisterhood). What has happened 
when this fraternity advertises 
a party that not only mocks the 
concerns of another group, but 
completely exacerbates the situ
ation, showing not only complete 
insensitivity but utter contempt 
towards another group?
Consider if the flyers had been 
for a White-Supremist Blow
out, with the depiction of the 
stereotypical African-American, 
fat lips and afro hairstyle. Even 
with a disclaimer (how clever of 
the PiLam men to have covered 
themselves), anyone on campus 
would be hard-pressed to argue 
that it was just a joke. If such 
standards apply to racist epi
thets and representations, then 
why not to sexist ones?
The University must lead stu
dents out of darknessnot only 
for the professional world or fur
ther study, but for a greater 
democratic society that respects 
individuals for what they stand 
for and what they believe, not 
for their gender.

Loomis explains 
sexist proposal
Editor:
At the last 
Student Sen
ate, I offered a 
resolution ex
pressing symOS
Letter to the Editor
pathy for SAE fraternity having 
to endure protest by a few 
Chatham women. Though I did 
not expect the resolution to pass, 
I had two serious purposes for 
offering this resolution. The first 
was to show that Senate rejects 
the notion that fraternities are 
bastions of inappropriate behav
ior. Some people seem to be
lieve that if there were no fra
ternities then sexism, homo
phobia, and racism would dis
appear. Such beliefs are absurd. 
The attitudes of fraternity mem
bers merely mirror those of cam
pus, which unfortunately do 
leave something to be desired.
The second reason was to rebuke the protesters. They per
petuate the confusion of sexual
ity with sexism. Sexism is the 
treatment of women as some
way inferior, incapable or unde
sirable. Both men and women 
promote sexist attitudes. For in
stance, a mother telling her 
daughter that women are not 
good at math is promoting a sex
ist attitude. A poster with graph
ics that utilize a rather obvious 
pun, Moby Dick equals big pe
nis, may be in bad taste, but is 
not sexist.
Where does this confusion 
come from? Partly, the problem 
is a result of the difficulty in 
addressing the real problems 
women face, including restricted 
access to abortion, a concentra
tion of women in low-paying ca
reers, and a relative lack of power 
in relationships with men.
Rather than address the real 
issues, the protesters prefer the 
easier route  attacking por
nographyas their foremothers 
attacked alcohol and promoted 
Prohibition. Finding a scape
goat, be it heterosexual men 
having sexual thoughts or male 
drinkers, provides titillation. 
Protesting a poster suggesting a 
mermaid performing fellatio on 
an aquatic mammal is logical in 
this context.
The confusion of aims causes 
two problems. When Freed con
demned the SAE brothers for 
not having the guts to stand up 
to this sexist poster, she con
vinced them not to take the state
ments of feminists seriously, 
which is unfortunate since some 
feminist critiques of society are 
worthwhile. An even more im
portant problem is that people 
who take these women seriously 
might be led to believe that cen
sorship is an appropriate means 
to better society. Senate itself 
shows that some have accepted 
this argument. When the mo
tion was defeated, Senator 
Knauer attempted to expunge it 
from the minutes, and Tartan 
Editor-in-Chief Heidi Hoover de
livered a vituperative speech, 
expressing her disgust at the 
motion. The censorship at
tempted by Knauer and the in
tolerance of Hoover show my
fears are not unwarranted.

This time of 
year ushers in 
the season of 
hope and re
newal for the 
Jewish people, the Festival of 
Liberation celebrating the Passover Holiday.
This commemorates the exo
dus and liberation of Jews in 
olden times from slavery under 
the Pharaoh in Egypt. The word 
passover, in Hebrew Pessach, 
lends itself to a variety of mean
ings. On the one hand it recalls 
the time when the Angel of 
Death spared the first-born chil
dren of Israel by passing over 
Israelite homes in order to en
sure Jewish survival. Passover 
also celebrates the spring time 
of the year and our rejoicing in 
the reawakening of nature co
mingled with the hope for the 
regeneration of human idealism 
and social justice. Our celebra
tion is not complete without ef
forts to relieve the oppression of 
all people suffering from any 
form of injustice and violence or 
hatred.
In 1943 during the Holocaust

Sure, its more discrimination 
in terms of stereotyping, where

other types of people like women

theyre discriminated against in

Abortion debate usually misrepresented
R.D. Quinn
For the last several weeks the issue 
of abortion has been written about from 
various points of view in The Tartan. I 
agree with none. There are weaknesses 
in both the arguments of those promot
ing pro-choice and those supporting 
the pro-life view. Somehow the discus
sion of abortion gets into a debate over 
issues and facts which have little or no 
relevance to the issue of abortion.
For me, unlike many people, abor
tion is a black and white issue, with 
very little gray. There is a simple choice 
to be made, and that is whether life 
begins at conception or not. This is the 
only issue at hand, but both the prochoice and pro-life advocates misrepre
sent the issue by discussing womens 
rights, religion, viability, psychological 
harm to women, parental consent, and 
so on.
There is only one question to be asked 
does human life begin at conception? 
When conception takes place, a unique 
set of human DNA is created and the 
zygote immediately begins rapid 
growth. For me, that is a definition of 
the beginning of life. Science hasnt 
proven it to be a fact, but some determi
nation has to be made, and since all life 
is based on its unique DNA, conception
seems the likely place to mark as the 
beginning of a new human life.
Once the beginning of life has been 
defined, there is an obligation to pro
tect that innocent life from harm. That 
is the only reason necessary to justify 
being pro-life and against abortion. 
Religious beliefs only weaken the ar
guments, and trying to prove the harm
ful affects on women because of abor
tion is irrelevant.
Personally, I have made a decision 
on when life begins  although it is 
based on some scientific facts, it is in 
essence an opinion. However, I have 
made a judgement and base my opin
ions and beliefs firmly on that judge
ment. The pro-choice political move
ment seems to ignore this issue and 
concentrate on the issue of womens 
rights.
Several years ago I thought that the 
pro-choice movement made a lot of 
sense, but I came to the realization 
that the ideology of the pro-choice move
ment was very flawed and that prochoice ideas had led many individuals 
to believe in the pro-choice movement 
based on a false sense of American 
freedom and choice.
The major problem that exists in prochoice ideology is the inability to deal 
with the issue of when life begins. Ob
viously it is far easier to ignore the 
issue or to talk about rights and pri
vacy. However, if we are dealing with 
another humans right to life, then 
rights and privacy of the mother are no
longer valid arguments for abortion.
It is often debated as to when a fetus 
becomes a person. This is a separate 
arguement from when life begins. The 
idea of person is dependent on viabil
ity of the fetus and the functioning of 
certain parts of the nervous system. 
The problem with defining a fetus as a 
person is that it is even more vague 
than when life begins. The defining of 
when a fetus is a person is a convenient 
way of dehumanizing the early part of 
a pregnancy, thus justifying abortion.
It may seem simplistic to make such 
a judgement as to when life begins 
when science has yet to come up with a 
definitive answer. However, giving up 
on the issue and saying since we dont 
have proof when life begins and allow
ing abortion until the fetus looks hu
man is no solution. If, in some way, it is 
shown that life does not begin at con
ception, then I have chosen a belief 
that ultimately allows for a human life 
to begin. However, if I am correct about 
the beginning of life, then being prochoice means the murder of innocent 
human life has been allowed to occur. I 
would much rather be on the side that 
creates than destroys.
Another flaw in pro-choice ideology 
is its basis on anti-religion sentiments. 
Many vocal pro-choice individuals use 
anti-religion rhetoric as a way of chal
lenging pro-life. The classic statement 
is You cant force your religious values 
on other people. For many people their 
religious values and personal values
and morals are one and the same. If 
religious values are used for pro-life 
ideology, it is no different then any 
basis for pro-choice ideology. The sepa
ration of church and state does not 
mean individuals cannot use their reli
gious values as a basis for support of 
certain laws.
We as a society are always forcing 
our values on other individuals  that 
is what laws are all about. Very few 
people would question that stealing is 
wrong, and so we have laws that state 
it is illegal to steal from others: The 
only difference between abortion and 
stealing, in terms of creating law, is 
that more people question whether 
abortion is morally wrong.
If the notion of law within society is 
accepted, then a pro-choice individual 
must accept thatit is. well within bounds 
of the American system to have laws 
controlling or outlawing abortion. Laws 
are meant to protect individuals against 
harm or to protect their rights. If abor
tion is the destruction of a life, then a 
womans right to choose is subordinate 
to that of the fetus. The other option is 
to abandon any concept of law and 
accept anarchy. Theft, murder, rape, 
and other assorted crimes are all a 
matter of one group forcing their val
ues on others. It is fortunate that al
most everyone can agree that these 
crimes are wrong, unlike the issue of 
abortion.
The idea that a woman holds com
plete control of her reproductive sys
tem is also an ideological problem with 
the pro-choice movement. There is no 
question that  prior to conception  
a woman has absolute control over her 
body and her choice in reproduction, 
whether married or not. Once a woman 
becomes pregnant, however, that idea 
does not hold true, because the preg
nancy is the result of two people. If a 
woman is given ultimate control of the 
pregnancy, then the child that is bom 
would be hers and only her responsibil
ity. This idea is ridiculous, but it is the 
logical end of an ideology that gives 
control of a pregnancy exclusively to 
the mother.
Since the woman carries the child, 
control of the pregnancy  in an abso
lute sense  is hers, but from a legal 
and moral sense it cannot be so. The 
father should have just as much right 
and responsibility for a pregnancy as 
the mother. Pro-choice opposition to 
spousal consent implies that the father 
has no rights, which leads to the con
clusion that he should have no respon
sibility, either. This contradicts the 
reality of paternity suits and child sup
port.
Because the pro-choice movement 
portrays abortion as a constitutional 
right, many people are led to believe 
that it would be unfair to tell women 
what they can and cannot do with their 
bodies. Americans like the idea of per
sonal freedom and the idea that they 
can control their lives. It is therefore

Americans unsure on issue
AMERICANS, from page 8
easy to believe that pro-choice is 
the American way, after all we 
live in a free country. This leads 
many people who are unsure if a 
life begins at conception, or even 
those who do believe that to be 
the case, to support the prochoice movement.
The most infamous example 
of this is Governor Mario Cuomo 
of New York. Despite personal 
beliefs against abortion he is 
pro-choice. This is not surpris
ing of a politician, but many 
ordinary individuals adopt this 
attitude. If you believe some
thing to be wrong, especially a 
life or death issue, then there is 
a moral obligation to try and 
stop the activity from occurring, 
whether that be going out and 
protesting or voting for a candi
date who supports your view. I 
have more respect for those who 
do not believe in the rights of the 
fetus, than those who believe it 
personally wrong, but would al
low abortion to be a legal option.
Opinion polls on abortion sup
port the notion that many people 
have some moral objections 
against abortion yet support the 
legal right to abortion. In a 1989 
poll by Newsweek, 57 percent of 
those polled believed that abor
tion should be legal if there is a 
chance the baby is deformed, 35 
percent supported legal abor
tions for economic reasons, 30 
percent supported legal abor
tions if the child is unwanted, 
and only 15 percent supported 
legal abortion if the parents 
wanted a different sex. Legal 
abortion if the womans life is 
endanger or pregnancy due to 
rape or incest was supported 89 
percent and 81 percent respec
tively. The total number of 
people totally against abortion 
was 18 percent, those who sup
ported abortion under any cir
cumstance 27 percent, and those 
who support legal abortions 
under certain circumstances 
was 50 percent.
These results show that a 
large percentage of people felt 
that abortion was wrong in cereffort to making people of all 
ages aware of the importance of 
birth control, including absti
nence. The promotion of birth 
control no doubt upsets the reli
gious right, but the use of birth 
control is a far lesser evil then
The promotion of birth control no 
doubt upsets the religious right, 
but.... if the use of birth control and 
sex outside of marriage are truly 
sins in the eyes of God, then let that 
be His judgement.
tain cases and not others. Indi
viduals appear to avoid the is
sue of life and look at the reason 
for abortion. I contend that if 
abortion is permissible if the 
mother is unmarried, then abor
tion because the parents want a 
different sex child is equally 
valid. However, 85 percent of 
people polled believed that abor
tion for for sex determination 
should be illegal  but why? 
One conclusion is that a major
ity of people question the mor
ality of abortion, but dont want 
to seem unfair by taking away a 
right that is supposedly consti
tutional guaranteed.
If abortion is to be outlawed or 
severely restricted, it is often 
stated that poor women and 
teenagers will suffer the most 
hardship. No doubt this would 
be true, but the problem of un
wanted pregnancy can be solved 
through education. Proper use 
of birth control would reduce the 
number of unwanted pregnancy. 
This does not just mean distrib
uting a condom to every fourteen-year-old.
There needs to be a national
abortion. If the use of birth con
trol and sex outside of marriage 
are truly sins in the eyes of God, 
then let that be His judgement. 
Abortion, on the other hand, is a 
sin against humanity and it is 
far better to leave birth control 
up to the individual.
Some say that abortion is not 
a mans problem, but I must 
disagree. The debate when life 
begins is an issue that we all 
must deal with. It may be unfair 
that the female sex is given the 
burden of pregnancy, but un
born children are the responsi
bility of both men and women, 
both father and mother.
The issue of abortion will not 
be resolved until the vast major
ity of Americans really pick a 
side and avoid the convenient 
middle ground. I am prepared to 
accept the majority opinion, but 
currently the country is split on 
the issue. If more people take a 
stand based on their personal 
morals perhaps the deadlock can 
be broken.

raphy in one county where it is 
not obscene, I can be sued if a 
man buys some there, reads it in 
his county where it is obscene, 
and then rapes a woman. In ef
fect, someone else will be defin
ing morality for me.
This bill, if law, would also * 
shift blame away from the per
son who committed the crime, 
the rapist. One of the most igno
rant arguments that used to be 
used by rapists was the line, 
Well, men just cant control 
their hormones. Women 
shouldnt be teases because they 
should know how men think and 
act.
Men are responsible for their 
actions. This bill is the same 
thing as saying, The devil made 
me do it. It is an insult to me as 
a man because it implies that I 
am so lacking my own will and 
sense of morality that pornogra
phy can make me rape a woman.
And finally we come to the 
most important issue of all, the 
right to free speech. Granted, 
this bill does not outlaw speech, 
per se. It does, however, provide 
a frightening method with which 
people can sue publishers and 
distributors.
Why publish anything even 
remotely controversial contain
ing anything about sex lest you
run the risk of a lawsuit. Heres 
an example:
Suppose I write a novel. In 
this novel, I write a graphic de
scription of a rape scene. This 
scene is important because later 
in the novel, I use the images 
presented to show how the rape 
affected the womans thoughts 
and views on life.
A man reads this novel. He 
decides to mimic the rape scene. 
My publisher, the distributors, 
and the book store that sold the 
man the book all get sued by the 
woman whom he raped. As a 
result, my publisher never again 
wishes to print something I write 
thats a potential case for a law
suit. Controversy is crushed.
Mind you, the same argument 
could be used with some of the 
authors I listed above. They may 
not have rape scenes in their 
books, but they*sure have some 
things that could appear to be 
degrading to women.
Luckily, many people and 
groups have challenged this bill. 
They include John Irving, Betty 
Friedan, the Motion Picture As
sociation of America, and Femi
nists for Free Expression. They 
all realize the threat this bill 
poses.
The facts are simple. There is 
no proven link between sex 
crimes and pornography. The
definition of pornography itself 
is too vague. It can be applied 
too easily to anything dealing 
with sex. In addition to this, the 
bill disregards the fact that what 
is pom to one is art to another.
In their attempt to squelch 
pom and destroy obscenity, the 
supporters of this bill have them
selves completely disregarded 
common sense. They try to gain 
support by throwingin child por
nography, a sick thing itself be
cause the participants are not 
willing adults. They treat adults 
who read pornography as chil
dren because, goodness forbid, 
they would be influenced enough 
to go out arid rape someone.
How long before the authors I 
listed above are the cause of law
suits? How long before the pub
lisher of The Tartan is sued be
cause a reporter dared to do a 
story on a rape that someone 
else read and copied. How long 
before catalogs with lingerie are 
considered obscene?
If there is anything obscene, 
its this bill. Its too bad we cant 
sue the supporters for it. That 
would be justice.
Christian M. Restifo is a jun
ior chemical engineering major. 
He finds it hard to believe that 
the SI swimsuit issue could be 
considered pornography.

Chatham protest should be cheered and booed
Rich Robinson
Two protests were featured in 
last weeks Tartan  the prochoice march in Washington 
D.C. and a protest over a sexist 
poster. Sadly, the march, at
tended by a Carnegie Mellon 
campus organization, was not 
the one to receive the most press. 
 Instead, a group of Chatham 
students that protested a poster 
made by SAE received the most 
attention. The poster was 
deemed sexist because it de
picted a mermaid supposedly 
performing fellatio on a whale.
; Yes, the poster was wrong, 
and SAE did try to rectify the 
situation as quickly as possible. 
SAEs president extended a for
mal apology and the posters 
were all replaced, which is all 
SAE could do to try and fix the 
problem.
; The apology, though, was 
turned down by Blaire Freed, 
one of the protestors. Freed left 
Carnegie Mellon for Chatham
because of blatant male sex
ism at CMU. She goes as far as 
saying that Carnegie Mellon is 
abastion of sexistmale thought.
Freed manages to ignore the 
fact that Chatham, an all-fe
male school, last year denied 
opening their educational doors 
to men. Carnegie Mellon, on the 
other hand, is a co-educational 
school that is educating women 
in engineering and business so 
that they may even out the im
balance of the sexes in those 
fields. Also, a co-educational 
school allows people to come in 
contact with each other and have 
some type of mutual under
standing.
Freed also says that the fra
ternities are all promoting sex
ism against women. Yet, that 
doesnt seem to bother her when 
she attends their parties, as Ive 
heard she did the weekend be
fore the protest.
The hypocritical and double 
standard attitude demonstrated 
by some of the protestors just 
helps to ruin a good cause. Yes, 
there is a problem with sexism
 not only at Carnegie Mellon, 
but everywhere, including
Chatham. But you cant expect 
something to change when you 
use half-truths and ignore the 
whole picture.
Also, by not accepting SAEs 
apology and their move to get 
rid of the offending posters, the 
protestors simply illustrated 
that they did not want to work 
out any problems. Instead, it 
seems like they were just gloryhunting.
What needs to be done is edu
cation and working together to 
create more understanding. 
Freeds inability to open up such 
meaningful dialogue, though, is 
illustrated by her comment 
about Dean Murphy.
I challenge Dean Murphy to 
a meeting of the minds. Murphy 
needs to sit down, listen, and 
comprehend why women wont 
tolerate pornographic represen
tations of them in print. Then 
he needs to act on it. Its a 
challenge for Freed. She wants 
to argue with Dean Murphy 
about sexism, instead of asking 
to work with him on creating an 
awareness group or opening up 
more dialogue on campus.
It appears from all of this that
Freed comes from a position that 
assumes men are all insensi
tive, sexist pigs that cannot un
derstand that sexism is wrong. 
Instead of working with people, 
she must argue. Instead of ac
cepting their victory in having 
SAE doing what they wanted, 
the protestors refused to leave 
the booth building site. The area 
was dangerous and Campus Po
lice worried about everyones 
safety. But the protestors 
couldnt even work with people 
on that point.
I would like to use the word 
compromise, but that would 
probably bring wrath in the form 
of we will not compromise our 
rights. But some form of under
standing must pass both ways. 
SAE understood what they put
on their posters was wrong. The 
protestors, though, didnt seem 
to understand that fact. And if 
they wanted to continue to pro
test, they could have understood 
the booth construction area was 
dangerous and moved to the 
front of SAEs house.
There was a point when the 
protestors themselves became 
problems. The Chatham protest
ors wanted something done 
about SAEs posters. They won, 
and they were right. Afterwards, 
however, they would not work 
with people to make sure every
one was safe.
These actions really hurt the 
image of their protest. By being 
annoying without being con
structive, people can see no rem
edy for a situation you want
action on. If you want change 
over a large issue, you also have 
to realize it wont happen over
night. Sexism wont leave over
night. But by accepting the fact 
that one victory is a step in the 
right direction, change can hap
pen faster on a larger scale than 
if it is pushed along without re
gard.
Now, dont get me wrong. I 
applaud the protestors for speak
ing out and doing something. 
Sexism is certainly an issue that 
needs to be addressed. But I do 
think that they handled it poorly 
and in a very self-righteous way.

Addictions are 
your friends
A month ago, I had decided 
that, if the National Hockey 
League players went on strike, 
I would boycott any remaining 
games. After all, the guys who 
get scratched from games get 
paid more than Ill ever see; so 
what are they whining, about? 
(As an aside, dont you love 
how that argument applies to 
almost every major profes
sional sport?)
Unfortunately, I made a 
mistake by accidentally 
switching to SportsChannel on 
Saturday night. The featured 
game was Detroit-Minnesota 
 during the regular season, 
this matchup would be like 
watching paint dry, but this 
was the playoffs. I fled to some 
sort of comedy show  those 
players werent going to get 
any of my free time.
A few minutes later, I tuned 
back in, ostensibly to get a 
better look at those new 
Minnesota Stars uniforms that 
I had heard so much about. 
This time the featured game 
was Vancouver-Winnipeg, 
normally another loser. I 
couldnt give you the names of 
more than five Vancouver 
players; even worse, Ed Olczyk 
is the only Jet I know. Unfor
tunately, the hometown 
Canucks had just killed a 
penalty and the crowd was 
into it at jet-engine sound 
level. It felt like I always 
imagined crack addiction 
would feel; my stomach was 
flipping around like a fish out 
of water and I broke out in a 
cold sweat, but I finally 
managed to push the button.
I finally gave up at three 
times. Strangely, I had to 
know whether it was Bob Papa 
or Dave Papa that was hosting 
the coverage this evening. 
Neither Papa brings edge-ofyour-seat excitement to a 
telecast; in fact, in either case, 
you want to put a mirror 
under his nose to see if it fogs. 
Yet I sat transfixed by 
Papavision  I had finally 
been broken.
In retrospect, I dont know 
why I held out so long. Their 
money situation shouldnt be 
my concern, since the Stanley 
Cup is such a prime opportu
nity to watch good hockey and 
a great excuse to spring for 
good Canadian beer instead of 
the usual Tumbling Pebble.
And of course there was 
always the fact that my 
beloved Pens are defending the 
Cup this year. What was I 
thinking?
And so Ill leave you with 
Predictions: The Quick Ver
sion  mind you, I havent 
watched a whole lot of games, 
so I may be overlooking a key 
injury somewhere. Montreal 
beating Boston in the Adams 
(although the Happy Whale 
gets my best wishes; picking 
any matchup other than 
Montreal-Boston would be a 
sign of dementia), Washington 
over New York (an ineffective 
Mario Lemieux will mean the 
Pens wont get past Washing
ton) in the Patrick, Chicago 
taking Detroit in the Norris, 
and the loveable Canucks in 
the Smythe. Washington will 
take Montreal in six to face 
Chicago (in five over the 
Canucks) with Washington 
taking the Cup.
A Penguinless Cup final isnt 
a pretty picture, but thats the 
way I see it.

Senior first baseman Todd Peterson burns a trail to the home piate in Thursdays game. The final score was 11-7 with CMU dominating for most of the game.
By DAVE MARTIN
Tartan Senior Staffwriter
Friday night, the Carnegie 
Mellon lacrosse club took on the 
Pittsburgh Lacrosse Club (PLC) 
at Gesling Stadium. CMU came 
out with all cylinders firing, but 
met some resistance through the 
second and fourth quarters. A 
physical battle, the game hung 
in the balance in the final min
utes. But PLC shot poorly and 
found that when their shots were 
on the mark, they were thwarted 
by senior goalie Peter Vonderlieth.
Through the first quarter, the 
teams played rough, but fairly 
evenly. Early on, CMU domi
nated, scoring three goals be
fore PLC had the opportunity to 
get on the board. Junior Todd 
Bredbenner scored the initial 
goal of the game only :40 into the 
first period. Senior John Seek
ings followed with a goal only 18 
seconds later, giving CMU a 2 
0 lead not quite a minute into 
the game. Freshman Chris 
Flynn started a high-scoring 
night for himself and the team 
by putting CMU up 30 with 
12:33 left in the first quarter. 
PLC rebounded, though, scor
ing two goals back-to-back 
within a minute of one another. 
And with only 1:20 to play in the 
period, PLC tied the game.
The second quarter went some
what slower, as both teams con
tinued to recieve penalties. PLC 
took the lead 1:01 into the sec
ond quarter on a controversial 
call. Goalie Vonderlieth at
tempted to clear the ball but was 
illegally slashed, which shook 
the ball loose for PLC to pick up. 
The referees failed to make the 
call, and counted the goal. PLC 
made the game 5-3 two minutes 
later. Seekings scored the sec
ond of his three goals to cut the 
lead to one. Flynn scored again 
nearly halfway through the sec
ond quarter, tyingthegame. But, 
PLC shot and scored with only 
:19 before intermission, tallying 
a 6-5 lead at halftime.
Bredbenner scored his second 
goal only :08 into the second 
half, tying the game at 6 apiece.
outlasts Pitt, 15-14
PLC countered a minute later to 
regain the lead. Flynn found the 
goal a third time 2:30 into the 
third quarter, but PLC re
bounded and once again re
gained the lead. Nearing the 
halfway mark of the third, Flynn 
scored the tying goal. The CMU 
defense began to pull together 
and shut down the attacking 
PLC offense. After a PLC pen
alty, Bredbenner scored with a 
one man advantage to take the 
lead for the first time since early 
in the game.
The fourth quarter consisted 
of the games fiercest activity. 
Bredbenner scored again, fol
lowed by a goal by Flynn on a 
man-up situation. Flynn scored 
again less than a minute later 
on what looked more like a pass, 
putting PLC down 12-8. Only 
:20 later, Bredbenner found the 
goal for the fifth time. Penalties, 
which had been committed 
throughout the game, became 
critical in the last ten minutes of 
the game.
Up 138, CMU went one-manup following a one-minute pen
alty against PLC. CMU contin
ued to dominate the pace, and 
forced shots on goal. One shot 
was deflected to the ground, 
where Seekings found it and re
turned it to the unsuspecting 
goalie. The six-point CMU lead 
was the largest of the game. But, 
PLC was due for a comeback. 
During a three-minute CMU 
penalty, PLC took advantage 
quickly. The gap was closed to 
four before Bredbenner shot the 
final CMU goal at the 7:00 mark. 
PLC returned to a one-man ad
vantage following a PLC insti
gated shuffle on the CMU side
lines. PLC scored one goal with 
the advantage.
With teams even and the score 
15-11, PLC made a consistent 
push to get the game into its 
hands. PLC scored a goal with 
3:25 left in the game to close the 
CMU lead to one, 15-14. The 
CMU defense came alive, ac
companied by PLC mistakes and 
critical Vonderlieth saves in the 
waning seconds of the game to 
hold on and keep the game that 
had been so firmly in their grasp.

Frisbee Golf games 
to help hungry
The Pittsburgh Flying Disc Society and Just 
Harvest, A Center for Action Against Hunger, will 
be holding an international disc golf tournament, 
April 25-26 and May 9.
All frisbee fanatics and people who want to end 
hunger should register to play in the Worlds 
Biggest Disc Golf Tournament on May 9, at 
Schenley Park. There will also be a tournament at 
Hampton Community Park on April 25-26. The 
Hampton Community Park course will open Fri
day 24, at noon and will offer several new chal
lenges this year.
Disc Golf is played like golf except that the 
object is to throw a disc into a basket rather than 
hitting a ball into a hole. The 1991 World Disc Golf 
Masters Champion, Red Whittington, will be at 
both parks. At Schenley he will give some 
playshops to teach the basics of the game.
At Hampton Community Park, professional com
petitions in open, women and masters (age 35 and 
over) will be held as well as amateur divisions. 
Free mini-discs will be given to all spectators.
The best time to watch the golf match will be 
during the 9-hole playoff at 1 pm Sunday (April 
26), said tournament director Keith Clark.
The Worlds Biggest Disc Golf Tournament will 
introduce many people to the good exercise, enjoy
ment, and friendly competition of Disc Golf, tour
nament director J. Gary Dropcho said about the 
day-long event, at Schenley. We expect that the 
majority of participants will be first-time players. 
People sign up for a tee time between 9 am and 7 
pm. This will let families or friends play their 
round of disc golf together. Prizes will be given 
away for hole-in-one, best score, worst score, old
est and youngest players, and for the most money 
raised for Just Harvest.
There is a $10 entry fee. All players will receive 
a t-shirt and tournament flying disc. 97Rock and 
Renaissance Pizza will supply midday music and 
the lunch for all participants in the tournament. 
Entry forms are can be picked up at the Schenley 
Park Disc Golf course, 97Rock, Renaissance Pizza, 
Hot Licks, The Balcony, Aiellos, Cafe Giovanni, 
or from any other of the Worlds Biggest Disc Golf 
Tournament sponsors. Please call 734-0321 for 
more information. Advance registration is recom
mended.
Participants can help raise money to end hun
ger by bringing their families and friends to play 
in the tournament.

Freshman Seminar in Modern Languages 
Bilingualism Throughout The World 
82-1809 units
Tuesday and Thursday 9:30 A.M.-10:50 A.M.
Professor Richard Tucker
This course will examine social and cognitive effects of knowing two languages, i.e. 
bilingualism. It will focus on the individual, the education system and society. We will 
begin by contrasting worldwide multilingual contexts such as India, Africa and parts of 
Europe with the language situation in the U.S. We will consider topics such as the 
measurement and description of bilingualism; the relationship between native language 
acquisition and second language learning; the intellectual consequences of becoming 
bilingual; the organization and implementation of programs designed to develop second 
language proficiency; and the societal repercussions of encouraging or discouraging second 
language learning or teaching programs.
LEARNING ABOUT LANGUAGE LEARNING

9 Units
Tuesday and Thursday 1:30 P.M.-2:50 P.M.
Professor Richard Tucker
This course is designed for students majoring or co-majoring in a Modem Language, or for 
students seriously contemplating undertaking the study of a foreign language at some future 
time. Experienced language learners bring to the tasks of learning a new language all sorts 
of general knowledge about the ways in which languages work as well as techniques for 
putting this knowledge to practicsJ use. The objectives of this course are to provide 
students with a basic introduction to those areas of linguistics and psycholinguistics that 
will facilitate their language learning; and to examine case studies of so-called Good 
Language Learners.

Introduction to Scientific-Technical Translation
9 units
Monday, Wednesday, Friday 11:30 A.M.-12:30 A.M.
Professor Dieter V.'aellermann
This course will introduce students to scientific-technical translation and the special areas of 
linguistic and cultural difficulties found in scientific-technical German texts. While 
students will be introduced to theories of translation, the course is essentially applied: 
students will be actively engaged in reading, analyzing, and translating scientific-technical 
German texts. We will primarily translate from German to English, and work on 
developing and fostering translation skills. Objectives include introduction to CMU's 
Center for Machine Translation and several of its on-going research projects and working 
with CMT's Translators Workstation for translating, editing, building vocabulary and 
glossary banks, and applying desktop-publishing skills in an actual translation project.

Volume 86, Issue 23The Tartan, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania20 April 1992
Earth Island Institute chair to speak Earth Day
ByAMYPOTTHAST
Tartan Features Editor
Wednesday is Earth Day, and to help 
us celebrate, one of the most active and 
j concerned environmentalists of the cen
tury is coming to speak. David Brower, 
founder and chair of the Earth Is
land Institute and 
former
director of the Sierra Club, has'fought 
to preserve life and hold back progress 
at every step, and in almost every cor
ner of the world.
Nominated twice for the Nobel Peace 
Prize, Brower has spent his life cam
paigning to protect wild lands, sea
shores, lakes and canyons'. His list of 
accomplishments, awards and honors 
fills pages. He expanded the Sierra 
Club from a regional to a national body 
during the 50s and 60s, 
and founded 
Friends of the 
Earth, a 
multi
national organization environmentally 
active in 50 countries. In 1982, Brower 
founded the Fate and Hope Confer
ences, a biennial tradition, which will 
be held in Zimbabwe this year., bring
ing together concerned groups from all 
over the world to achieve a healthy 
relationship with the Earth.
A vocal and determined opponent to 
the damming of the Grand and Glen 
Canyons and Dinosaur National Monu
ment, Browers tenacity and dedication 
have earned him the reputation of a 
militant and persistent environmental 
bulldog  an appropriate disposition 
for one facing such vile opposition as a 
world thats wasting away.
Now, Brower is focusing on projects 
taken on by the Earth Island Insti
tute, including the Interna
tional Green Circle project, 
inspired by Mikhail 
Gorbachev, who 
saw the need 
for the
restoration of environmentally devas
tated areas around the world.
The Institute, a network based in 
San Francisco that supports green 
projects around the globe, serving as a 
resource center and an embassy for the 
environmental world formulates criti
cal analyses of contemporary prob
lems, according to its self-defining lit
erature.
Some of these problems are tradi
tionally environmental, but many oth
ers bridge the gap between environ
mental perspective and important eco
logically related concerns such as hu
man rights, economic development in 
the Third World, economic conversion 
from militarization to peaceful produc
tion, and the impoverishment of our 
inner city communities.
Current projects of the Institute in
clude the Friends of Ancient Forests, a 
project informing the public about the 
importance of the old growth forests 
along the Pacific Coast, and the Inter
national Marine Mammal Project which 
is striving to save the lives of dolphins 
who have as a species fallen victim to 
the tuna industry and to end both 
commercial whaling and the use of 
drift nets.
The Baikal Watch is another In
stitute-initiated project, dedi
cated to the permanent pro
jection of Lake Baikal in the 
^Commonwealth of Inkdependant States. Ac\cording to an April 8, 
r \ 1991, Christian Sciwhence Monitor ar
ticle, Brower 
says of Lake 
Baikal, 
Its the
worlds oldest, deepest lake. Its got 
one-fifth of the worlds fresh lake water 
and some 1,200 species of plants and 
animals existing nowhgre else. The So
viets consider it one of their jewels. But 
if things go on [as they are now], it will 
be dead in 60 years.
The Earth Island Institute field ini
tiatives develop innovative appproaches 
to the problems it tackles, and encour
ages the public to challenge the Insti
tute with new problems.Jn an attempt 
to focus the groups efforts at the grass
roots level, a trend sweeping the whole 
green movement, the Institute has de
veloped Earth Island Centers through
out the U.S. and other countries.
Currently, the closest Center to CMU 
is the Philadelphia Center, to which 
interested individuals may write to in 
care of Jessica Krow, 3118 W. Penn St., 
Philadelphia, PA 19129. Soon, how
ever, the Environmental Resource Alli
ance of Pittsburgh (ERAP) will house a 
Pittsburgh Center.
ERAP director Josh Knauer, a stu
dent at CMU, is responsible for bring
ing Brower to campus. Knauer says, 
The reason weve decided [to ask 
Brower to speak] is that he is an inspi
ration to many environmentalists, and 
someone I look to as a role model.
Folks interested in learning more 
about Brower and the Institute are 
encouraged to attend his lecture at 8 
pm on Earth Day, this Wednesday, in 
the Skibo Ballroom.
There, Brower will have more infor
mation about the Earth Island Insti
tute. Representing the Institute at the 
organized Earth Week festivities on 
Sunday, Knauer will have an informa
tion table on the Cut providing infor
mation as well.
Pittsburgh celebrates the 
earth at Carnegie Mellon
Earth Day 1992 brings
awareness to campus
By MARNI BLAKE
Tartan Staffwriter
If youve been throwing your 
pop cans into recycling bins faith
fully, and youve given up aero
sol deodorants, then this com
ing week is for you. Earth Day 
1992 will take place on Carnegie 
Mellons campus, with a variety 
of entertaining and informative 
activities happening all week 
long.
CMUs student group EarthWise and the Environmental Re
source Alliance of Pittsburgh 
(ERAP) will sponsor many of the 
Earth Day activities together. 
The main event is the Earth Day 
Celebration this Sunday on the 
Cut, which the CMU Copy Cen
ter is co-sponsoring.
This celebration, the finale of 
the week, will feature three 
musical acts: Lochgil, the Bill 
Deasy Band, and Mike Messer. 
Several speakers will address 
environmental issues, including 
Roger Featherstone, the lead
ing organizer of the Native 
American environmental move
ment.
Tentatively planned to make 
appearances at the celebration 
are Democratic presidential can
didate Jerry Brown\ Senator 
Harris Wofford, and Senator 
Tom Harkin. In addition, a 
newpaper drive, sponsored by 
EarthWise, will take place in 
the Skibo parking lot from 12-6 
pm.
Other Earth Week events in
clude a lecture by David Brower,
chair of Earth Island Institute, 
on Wednesday. Brower is the 
former director of the Sierra Club 
and two-time nominee for the 
Nobel Peace Prize. Josh Knauer 
of ERAP says that Brower is 
basically considered the grand
father of the environmental 
movement. Hes inspired many, 
many people, including myself.
On Thursday, Indira Nair, 
head of CMUs Engineering and 
Public Policy Department will 
lecture on environmental issues 
also.
Saturdays events will include 
EarthRace, a marathon spon
sored in conjunction with out
side organizations such as Eatn 
Park. EarthWise will be assist
ing with the marathon and will 
show Dr. Seuss The Lorax as 
Saturdays feature film in DH 
2210.
Throughout the week, infor
mation tables will be outside the 
entrance to Doherty Hall. 
Groups such as the National 
Wildlife Federation, CMU Veg
etarians, Pugwash, and an ani
mal rights group from the Uni
versity of Pittsburgh will be 
present, along with various other 
groups. The issues these orga
nizations stand for are very im
portant to Earth Day and to the 
entire environmental move
ment. While the general public 
has become increasingly aware 
of the Earths troubles, there is 
still room for education.
I see Earth Day as a celebra
tion of our Earth. It is meant to 
make people aware of Earth and
its problems. Having this infor
mation available to people where 
they are enjoying fresh air and 
having fun will make them more 
aware [of what the environmen
tal movement is trying to do], 
explains Knauer.
Earth Day 1990 put environ
mental issues in the forefront 
politically as well as socially. 
Although this was a ma
jor positive step for 
the environment, 
some people 
find it distress
ing that such a 
movement is even 
necessary. Never
theless, Earth Day 
continues, but in 1992 
has become a distinctively 
grassroots movement.
According to Kristen Pape, 
president of EarthWise, small 
gatherings and localized action 
such as CMUs celebration al
low regular people to see what 
they are able to do for the move
ment focusing entirely on the 
rainforests and global issues 
makes it very hard for an indi
vidual to see what his or her own 
roles might be.
The small grassroots organi
zations like EarthWise at CMU 
are influential in such indi
vidual-oriented activities as re
cycling drives. Currently, 
CMUs recycling program is be
ing revised and expanded. By 
next fall it is intended that ev
ery dorm will have stations for 
paper, glass, aluminum, and 
cardboard on every floor.
Local activists still realize, 
however, that a grassroots move
ment cannot do it allthe move
ment depends on large national 
organizations, who have the 
money, political power, and in
fluence to achieve goals through 
lobbying and otherwise extend
ing awareness. Such political 
power is necessary to overcome 
opposition, whether it is local 
opposition or world-wide.
For instance, the issue of the 
' toxic waste incinerator in Pitts
burgh has become an intense 
debate, along with the Univer
sity of Pittsburghs debate over 
plans to build a largetelescope 
program in Arizona. This pro
gram will threaten the Mount 
Graham red squirrel with ex
tinction and endanger at least
30 other species of wildlife.
Obviously, there are too many 
different environmental prob
lems for one organization to 
tackle, but events like this Pitts
burgh community Earth Day 
are a way to initiate an attack 
on as many problems as pos
sible.
EarthWises aim is to gener
ate concern and further educa
tion about the issues, says 
Pape. Everyone knows now to 
recycle, but now people nefed to 
start thinking about reducing 
their wastefulness.
Above all, Earth Day is meant 
to create enthusiasm for our 
planet and as Pape says regard
ing the environmental move
ment, We want the image to
change from a closet, liberal, 
fringe movement to something 
that everyone is involved in.  And 
everyone in the Pittsburgh and 
CMU community are encouraged 
to get involved in the cost-free 
Earth Day activities all week.

Javis back, complains about noisy moviegoers
Womens magazines reveal mens darkest secrets
The six semesters worth of weekly 
columns which I wrote for The Tartan 
during my four years at Carnegie Mel
lon were summed up by some friends 
(and some not so friends) as Javi bitches 
about the movies and MTV. Seeing as 
it has been less than a year since I 
graduated, I dont see any reason to 
deviate from the norm.
The United States is facing a severe 
crisis of civility. One need only attend 
any movie in any enormo-plex to see 
what I am talking about. Moviegoingin 
Amercia has become a gladiatorial con
test between the spectator who wants 
to enjoy the movie and those who be
lieve that their seven and a half dollars 
entitles them to provide colorful com
mentary for the duration of the picture.
Now, Im not just referring to the 
garden-variety idiots who have spoiled 
movies for so many over the years. 
People like that woman whose non
stop poly-decibel wailing accentuated 
the pathos of the last twenty minutes of 
Dead Poets Society, or the man who, 
during those incredibly tense parallel 
cuts which put so many on the edge of 
their seats during the climax of Silence 
of the Lambs, saw fit to yell OH MY 
GOD! ITS THE DEATHS HEAD 
MOTH! RUN FOR YOUR LIFE! RUN
JAVIVISION
by Javier Grillo-Marxuach
FOR YOUR LIFE! have been with us 
since the days of Pickford and Chaney. 
These people can (sometimes) add 
much-needed spice to the moviegoing 
experience. The chorus of boors, bores 
and bozos I am referring to points to a 
much more disturbing trend.
What is it that compels one man to 
loudly describe the movie as it unfolds 
before him in all of its predictability? 
What is it that pushes some to the point 
that they believe themselves to be ac
tive participants in the action and re
spond (in character, no less) to the 
dialogue on the screen? What is it that 
moves some to repeat lines of dialogue 
into the next hour of the film (Over
heard during a recent screening of 
Freejack: DICKHEAD! HA! CAN YOU 
BELIEVE SHE CALLED HIM A 
DICKHEAD! THE NUN SAID DICK
HEAD! I CANT BELIEVE IT! 
DICKHEAD! SHE SAID DICKHEAD! 
DID YOU HEAR THAT NUN SAY 
DICKHEAD?  and so on ad nauseum)?
There are two possible answers. One 
of them is that the video-setted public 
has been lulled into such a state of 
intellectual catatonia that they need to 
use their talking-out-loud skills in or
der to interpret the finer nuances of 
Hook. As a fledgling screenwriter I find 
this answer intensely depressing, and 
when I consider this possibility, I often 
consider taking up painting (something 
I discount the moment I remember that 
idiot at the Louvre: IT WAS JUDAS! 
DONT LET HIM GET AWAY WITH 
IT, JESUS! JUDAS DID IT! IT WAS 
JUDAS! RUN FOR YOUR LIFE!).
A second explanation is that the re
cent spate of movie-house impoliteness 
is a function of the movies themselves. 
Though the Hollywood cinema has 
never been ideologically blameless, is it 
possible that the moyies have so dete
riorated at the character-story-plot level 
that the audience feels the need to 
bring their own brand of commentary 
to the theaters? Could it be that we are 
witnessing a vocal form of protest (how
ever misguided and Neanderthal) 
against the sludge bom from the alien
ation of creativity in the morally dead 
and intellectually suspect wastes of Los 
Angeles?
The idea of a grassroots critical revo
lution against the system is every 
idealists wet dream. If such a move
ment exists, the fact that it has been 
fostered by media-suckled idiots like 
Leonard Maltin, Siskel and Ebert, and 
Premiere magazine is all the more trou
bling. As amusing as it is to watch The 
Fat Guy and The Other One quibble 
over the latest wrinkle on Jessica Tandy, 
their brand of commentary upholds the 
system they claim to criticize. What 
good is it if an audience can only com
ment on films in terms of its value to 
the consumer? What good is it to have 
an audience that is so film-sawy it can 
spot continuity errors in the best crafted 
films but cannot define or articulate 
the empty feeling they get after the 
lights come up as anything other than 
thumbs up or thumbs down?
Even the best-intentioned films of 
this day suffer from emotional and 
structural problems. I like to think that 
the reaction of the audience to the worstintentioned films (Basic Instinct comes 
to mind) shows that at some level, the 
audience is aware that the qualities 
which have kept them from question
ing the intellectual soundness of their 
entertainment (action, sex, gore) are no 
longer enough to tide them over. Some, 
like the guy who got such a kick out of 
hearing a nun say the word dickhead 
in the movie Freejack, will settle for 
less and like it. Maybe the rest will take 
up painting.
Former Tartan columnist Javier 
Grillo-Marxuach is a graduate screenwriting student at the University of 
Southern California. He would like to 
remind you that MTV is run by a media 
conglomerate named Viacom, and thus, 
the fashionable anarchy and political 
correctness it peddles in the form of 
socially acceptable minority VJs with 
carefully scripted radical patter and 
the so-called alternative and street 
music it belches, is no more than a 
malicious con on a generation which 
has already been cruelly disserviced by 
self-proclaimed spokesmen such as Nir
vana and the sub-moron Brett Easton 
Ellis. In addition, Javier GrilloMarxuach believes that Kurt Loder is a 
sanctimonious windbag who, if he were 
only half aware of how transparent the 
fact is that he is a whore and a sellout, 
would take up painting immediately.

And we are all afraid to talk 
about it and find we are all in 
the same boat.
Unfortunately, this is the 
point where I must question the 
credibility of such articles. All 
the men interviewed and quoted 
seem to already have mental 
problems. By mental problems, 
I do not mean that they are all 
about to breakdown and go on 
killing sprees in 7-1 ls because 
they can no longer stand the 
fact the cashiers speak only six 
English words, four of which are 
Have a nice day. I simply mean 
that they are showing signs of 
work-induced stress or that they 
have problems that do not stem 
from the fact they are men.
In this fear article, one mans 
concerns were shown as indica
tive of the fact that all men are 
afraid of losing control. This par
ticular guy had a fear of being 
struck by lightning. Since he 
was almost struck by lightning 
as a kid, it would be more logical 
to assume that he would have a 
fear of this because of the inci
dent and not because hes afraid
poor Billy wont have his dad at 
the little league game because 
hes been fried to a crisp.
When all is said and done, 
however, the most interesting 
article is still the male fantasy 
piece. In this writing, we read as 
men discuss their fantasies. 
Then, as a bonus, we get to read 
an interpretation of these fan
tasies by a medical doctor.
Naturally, all these fantasies 
can be classified into only a few 
categories. They include the fol
lowing: the Meet a Stranger 
and Have Sex With Her Then 
Never See Her Again bit, the 
Lots of Women Want Me But I 
Choose the Best Looking story, 
the Exciting Sexual Encounter 
With My Wife fantasy, and the 
My Wife, the Hooker dream.
The revealing part is not the 
dream but the interpretation. It 
was interesting to note in my 
research that all the negative 
interpretations, the ones that 
called men insecure and unable 
to handle feelings or intimacy, 
were interpretations of dreams 
by single men. While I think 
that it is good and healthy for a 
man to have fantasies about his
wife, I cant blame single men 
for the Lots of Women sce
nario. After all, the guy isnt 
married. How can he have a wife 
to fantasize about?
One final point that must be 
dealt with is the fact that not 
one of the men in any of the 
articles I read was a blue-collar 
worker. All of them were middleto high-level executives with 
stressful jobs. Something tells 
me that blue-collar mens 
spouses who read these things 
are getting a warped view of 
men.
Okay, so I lied at the begin
ning of my column. I dont think 
these magazines are good re
sources. They just go to show 
how little men and women re
ally understand each other. At 
least they provide motivation for 
a better understanding between 
the sexes. Now I just have to find 
mens magazines (besides Play
boy) that write about women.
Christian Restifo is a junior 
chemical engineering major. 
Next time he will discuss that 
confusing subject on which he is 
a littleknown expert  women.
The first time The Wizard of 
R.A. appeared, I received a 
great number of comments 
about it. Apparently, people 
were glad that someone had 
taken on the complex issue of 
men. No doubt, however, some 
thought it to be too much on the 
lighter side. Perhaps I should 
have taken the issue a little 
more seriously.
Well, I thought and thought 
about it, and you know what, 
they were right. By looking at 
surveys about men by men, I 
neglected any type of objective 
perspective. Desiring to achieve 
this even-handedness, I looked 
far and wide for ground-break
ing research on the subject of 
men. After many, many hours 
of research, I found the perfect 
reference  typical womens 
magazines.
We know these publications 
by their famous namesJour
nal, First For Women, Glam
our, Cosmopolitan, and others. 
You know what Im talking 
about. Its those magazines that 
contain three to four pages of 
advertisements for every page 
of actual copy. And some decide 
to number the advertisement 
pages erradically, making it dif
ficult to locate an article in less 
than five minutes. In every is
sue of every magazine, there is 
yet another article discussing
THE WIZARD OF R.A.
by Christian Restifo
the flaws of men and how you, 
the caring, sensitive, under
standing modern-day woman, 
can get your man to open up, 
confront his fears, show concern 
for you, improve your sex life, 
become more sensitive, and be a 
nice daddy.
In order to lend credence to 
the article, the author, typically 
a man, speaks to experts on 
men. For example, when discuss
ing why men fear the use of sun 
tan lotion, the author will quote 
Dr. John/Jane Smith, a sociopychobiopoliticolinguist with a 
dsegree in the treatment of foot 
fungi, who has done research on 
a group of high-level male ex
ecutives suffering from mental 
disorders involving fixations 
with their mothers. With such 
irrefutable evidence, the author 
or doctor goes on to say that 80 
percent of all men dont under
stand why women are open about 
personal things because said
men werent breast-fed enough 
as children.
I perused these magazines to 
find out why I do the things I do. 
Since I wish to make my girl
friend happy and keep our rela
tionship healthy, I thought it 
might help to understand my
self and my buddies.
One article that really had 
nothing to offer to me personally 
was one dealing with why men 
dont talk to women. I have little 
trouble talking. However, it 
seems as though wives are upset 
that men will talk to their friends 
but not their wives. This article 
offered advice to help your man 
open up.
One poignant tip said that 
the woman should learn to fight 
fairly. Unwittingly, the author 
gave away the reason men dont 
like to talk candidly to women 
arguments. Any man who has 
ever fought with a woman knows 
that not even the Almighty Hand 
of God will help you win. No 
matter what you say, even if you 
give up and say shes right and 
youre absolutely wrong, she will 
find something to complain 
about.
I was rather surprised when I 
saw a piece about mens fears. 
Apparently, the majority of us 
men have these deeply rooted 
fears about appearing feminine, 
failing at our jobs, being unable

THE TARNA2 1 0AR2EthE iEssu2 1 rd ayRhs .SSreUFriendships sputter when arguments arise
Good morning, boys and girls! 
Its a bright, sunshiny day, but 
today were going to talk about 
something that makes things not 
so bright and sunshiny. Today 
were going to talk about argu
ments. Can you say that, boys 
and girls? Ar-gu-ments.Very 
good!
Have you ever gotten into an 
argument with someone and you 
really wish it never happened? 
One that got really ugly because 
the things said were true, and 
the truth hurts? One where you 
got the silent treatment just be
cause you decided to say some
thing that was on your mind?
Right now, two very good 
friends of mine are in the midst 
an argument. For the sake of 
protecting their identities, 111 
call them Fay and Death Star. 
(Im not calling him Death Star 
because I cant be more creative 
or because hes hooked on Star 
Wars; its just that a part of his 
name sounds quite similar to 
that. Really.)
Lets see. Im not sure who 
started this argument because I 
can trace its roots back to Janu
ary or so, but I know that Fay is 
the one who made a big deal 
about it very recently. Maybe 
she shouldnt have, but she just 
wanted to get it off her chest. I 
know that much.
Heres the deal with their 
friendship. Its supposed to be
EVERYBODY TALKS 
ABOUT THE WEATHER
by Susan Abrams
completely open and honest. 
Thats a great tactic, dont you 
think? But heres how it seems 
to work from where I stand:
Death Star is very honest, to 
say the least. He tells Fay what 
he likes and more often, what he 
doesnt like, about her. If hes 
bothered by something she says 
or does, he immediately tells her.. 
If he thinks shes too dressed up 
to go to a movie, hell tell her. If 
he thinks all she gives him is 
cop-out answers because she 
wont say whether his cologne or 
someone elses smells better, he 
tells her. Hes harsh (I hate 
that music.). Hes annoying 
(Contradiction is not an argu
ment.). Yet he tries to be tactful 
(You have puppy dog eyes.).
Fay takes it all. Sometimes 
she gets upset. But thats okay. 
Shes a woman; shes supposed 
to get upset. Luckily for her, 
shes the kind of person who can 
bounce back quickly because she
sees no use in holding a grudge.
But lets see what happens 
when it works the other way, 
when she says something hon
est to him.
If Fay tells Death Star that he 
looks terrible, he gets upset. If 
she tells him hes really bother
ing her and shes beginning los
ing her temper, he becomes as 
quiet as a churchmouse, curls 
up in a ball, and hides in a cor
ner. If she complains that he 
never remembers anything 
about her appeamace, he dis
misses it as unimportant. If she 
tells him she doesnt agree with 
him, he gets defensive. If she 
tells him shes very upset by 
something hes said or done and 
she goes on to explain why, he 
gets angry and ignores her. As of 
my writing this column (Thurs
day), he is still ignoring her.
I dont understand. Its okay 
for him to be brutally honest to 
her, but she cant be that way to 
him. Maybe Fay is just too nice 
a person, because she still really 
wants to be friends with Death 
Star. Maybe shes crazy (at least, 
I think so). But I know she wont 
give up.
Maybe its the other way 
around. Maybe men really are 
babies. (Coco Chanel once said, 
As long as you know that most 
men are like children you know 
everything.). Or maybe Death 
Star just really cant stand to get
a taste of his own medicine. No 
matter what, I say to him and 
Fay: youve both got to give and 
take and turn the other cheek.
This is a lot like doing my 
laundry. A few weeks ago when 
I did it, I lost a bra. Then the 
next time I did it, I lost a sock (I 
also found the lost bra in the 
bottom of my laundry bag, but 
thats not the point). The Lord 
giveth, the laundry brownie
taketh away.
In the same way, Fay decided 
to give her honesty and open
ness a spring cleaning and Death 
Star decided to take off. But 
Im going to keep doing my laun
dry, even though I will probably 
lose a towel the next time. And 
Im also going to keep waiting 
for that other sock to show up.
I hope my friends read this 
and know that I care about them
Ramsey Hong/Tartan Artist 
as well as their friendship. And 
I hope everyone realizes that its 
better to have the bite of a friend 
than the kiss of an enemy.
That's it for today, boys and 
girls. That wasnt so bad now, 
was it? It's time to shake hands 
and make up. See you next time!
. Tartan Contributing Editor 
Susan Abrams is a junior pro
fessional writing major.CMUs high ranking is due to boring classes
Greek Singis over, Carnival is 
over, myhangoverisover... must 
be that time of year again. That 
time of year when thousands of 
CMU students are faced with 
the decision of taking either 
Experimental Techniques in 
Mating Spores or Applying 
Three Dimensional Coordinate 
Geometry to Balloon Animals. 
Thats right, its registration 
time!
After four years of struggling 
to take one class each semester 
which doesnt have the word 
Applying, Survey, Structured, 
or Research in its title, Ive fi
nally figured out why CMU has 
the most boring classes in the 
world. It all boils down to the 
simple fact that CMU is consid
ered such a good school.
You see, CMUs ranking is 
heavily determined by presti
gious magazines like U.S. News 
and World Report, Time, and 
Newsweek. Now dont think for a 
second that these magazines 
even have a clue as to what 
makes a good school and a bad 
school  after all, theyre only 
news magazines. But if these 
magazines dont pretend every 
year, demonstrating to the 
American public that they know 
a little bit about everything un
der the sun  including who 
they believe are the best and 
worst colleges in the world  
then these magazines wouldnt 
be nearly as prestigious as they 
are today.
In turn, these magazines 
gather a whole bunch of so-called 
ranking experts every year 
who supposedly look very closely 
at all the colleges in the world 
and determine their rank by takP.PUB oxP841B
LIFE, THE UNIVERSE, 
AND STEVE
by Stephen Glicker
ing into careful consideration 
several important factors. These 
factors include the student-toteacher ratio, where the college 
is located, average SAT scores, 
and how easy itll be for each 
college administration office to 
determine where these ranking 
experts live.
However, after years of ex
haustive and painstaking re
search (the last four years of my 
life at CMU), I have finally de
termined how these ranking ex
perts truly determine the rank 
of a school. It all comes down to 
one question and one question 
only  how boring are the 
schools classes? Their logic is 
that the more boring the schools 
classes sound, the more presti
gious and difficult the school 
must be.
To prove my theory, lets take 
a little trip through next 
semesters schedule of classes, 
shall we?
First up we have Florescence 
Spectroscopy in Biological Re
search, Organotranstition Metal 
Chemistry, Piano Pedagogy, and
Membrane Biochemistry and 
Biophysics. Wow! Not only do 
these classes sound boring, but 
theyre really hard to pronounce 
as well! Im sure that we get big 
bonus points from the experts 
every year for pulling off this 
feat.
Next, we come to Design 
Grammars in CAE, JIT Manu
facturing Systems, and NMR 
Techniques, Instrumentation 
and Signal Processing. These are 
the types of courses which just 
jump out and scream to a rank
ing expert, Look at me! Look at 
me! Not only do I make no sense, 
but I have a fancy acronym to 
boot! These three courses alone 
are the reason we beat Pitt in 
the rankings every year.
Then we come across Macro 
Political Economy, Structured 
Analysis and Design,Lab, Lead
ership & Followership for Pro
fessional Effectiveness, Calcu
lus in Three Dimensions, and 
Structure andProperties ofThin 
Films. None of these courses 
have particularly hard words to 
pronounce or fancy acronyms, 
but do they sound boring! I 
wouldnt wish my worst enemy 
to take any of these courses. .
Finally, we come my two fa
vorite courses of all time  In
troduction to English: Argument 
and Introduction to English: In
terpretation. Back when I was a 
freshman these two courses were 
affectionately known as Strate
gies for Writing and Reading 
Texts. Two names which used to
roll off your tongue with the 
greatest of ease, and that will be 
burned in my brain for the rest 
of time (sandwiched between my 
images of Hell and what Leona 
Helmsley looks like naked). Yet, 
for some unknown reason, the 
titles Strategies for Writing and 
Reading Texts were changed to 
the monstrosities you see before 
you today.
Why, you ask. Why on earth 
did CMU change these names?
To further clarify the main 
focus of these two courses? No.
To form a stronger connection 
between the two courses by plac
ing Introduction to English in 
each title? No.
To try and fool students into 
thinking that these are two new 
classes being offered by the En
glish Department and see how 
many students are stupid 
enough to take these classes over 
again? No. Well, maybe.
The reason CMU changed the 
names of these two necessary ' 
classes comes down to one rea
son. Thats right, you guessedit, 
rank. Not only do these new
names sound so boring and un
interesting that any expert 
ranker would immediately give 
the school offeringthem a higher 
rank, but coupled with the fact 
that these two courses are of
fered with 15 sections each and 
every single semester, is the lone 
reason why CMU is one of the 
best 25 schools in the country.
But Steve, you say, why is it 
that colleges like Harvard and 
Yale offer cool classes like Im
prove Your Scrabble Game and 
To Eat or Not to Eat: Safety in 
Foods, but we dont? Shouldnt 
they be ranked lower according 
to your logic?
Well, no. You see, everyone 
knows that Harvard and Yale 
are great schools, its just fact. 
So when these ranking experts 
see a course like The Art of Jello 
Sculpting being offered at 
Brown, they just assume its the 
best damn Jello sculpting class 
in the world, and move on.
On the other hand, if we were 
to offer a class like that, taking 
into consideration the number 
of times youve heard where?
every time you told someone you 
were going to CMU, and youd 
have yourself a school ranked 
somewhere between Arts Sci
entific College of Pumping Gas 
and Cyndis School of Home 
Perm.
But dont feel bad while youre 
making your schedule out this 
week and cant decide whether 
youll have more homework in 
Reading the English Language 
Backwards, Bacteria: Our Tiny 
Little Friends or Lego Versus 
Tinker Toys: The Debate Con
tinues. Remember these three 
simple facts and youll feel a lot 
better: First, CMU is one of the 
best schools in the world. Sec
ond, youll probably make a ton 
of money for the rest of your life 
after you graduate from here. 
And third, you can cross-regis
ter at Pitt.

eFTHE TARNA2 1 0AR2EthE iEssu2 1 rd ayRhs .SSrProfanity provides answers to world peace
Somehow, somewhere, I hope 
that by some miracle a copy of 
this column reaches George 
Bush, Saddam Hussein, and the 
rest of the worlds fascist lead
ers. Why? do you ask? Because, 
I have the answer to world peace.
In case you dont read the elec
tronic bulletin boards that exist 
on campus, Id like to take the 
opportunity this week to intro
duce you to the wonderful world 
of electronic, public communi
cation. You can find any little 
comfortable niche hidden in the 
very expensive circuit boards 
and networks of Andrew. 
Whether you write science fic
tion or read adult literature you 
can settle in behind the key
board and chat away without 
the pesky personal features of 
face-to-face communication. You 
can even buy and sell the things 
you need, or dont need anymore 
on an electronic bulletin board.
In the event that you do read 
electronic bulletin boards on 
campus, that last sentence prob
ably gave away the whole topic 
of this weeks column. But if you 
dont read them and still havent 
got a clue about what Im talk
ing about, its okay, because 
youre right where youre sup
posed to be.
The electronic market bulle
tin boards are used by members 
of the campus community to buy 
and sell things  in theory. Re
cently, however, the discourse 
surrounding buying and selling 
has gone beyond mere economic 
terms. Things have become 
much more interesting lately.
As far as I can tell, a new 
precedent in public language
DRAGGED, KICKING & 
SCREAMING INTO...
by Bob Dixon
was set some time in March this 
year when someone tried to sell 
a rather pricey piece of electronic 
equipment. (Youll notice that 
Im making a concerted effort 
not to use any names or name 
brands. Im trying to protect the 
innocent and the guilty as well 
as maintain some sort of ironic 
standard of ethics.) The prece
dent seems to be invoked now 
whenever anyone disputes the 
proper price or working condi
tion  or anything else for that 
matter  of a piece of consumer 
electronics. Let me tell you how 
it all began.
In March, Person One was sell
ing the aforementioned pricey 
piece of electronic equipment 
and posted a notice on the elec
tronic bulletin board called 
cmu.market.
In response, Person Two re
plied that, for various reasons, 
thought the asking price of the 
item was inflated, and provided 
detailed reasons for his state
ment. In rebuttal, Person One 
said that Two must have been 
mistaken, and provided his rea
sons for this claim. It seemed all 
very civilized.

spectator sports. In support of 
Person Two, another party sub
mitted a message questioning 
how Two knew certain things 
about Person Ones item unless 
Two was telling the truth. The 
whole Whos on first? scenario 
ended with Get a life, geek! A 
rather common comment at 
CMU, this didnt evoke too much 
immediate response, and only one 
other message was posted before 
Person One posted a notice that 
the item was sold and that there 
was no longer a need for discus
sion. Following this were a num
ber of posts containing nasty epi
thets which taken collectively 
probably contain more profanity 
than the average low-quality pom 
movie.
There were, however, the few 
messages that were not personal 
attacks against one individual or 
another. I stress few because in 
actuality there was only one per

Maybe this is how the United States government should 
settle its differences with the Middle East. Well send 
them a workstation and a modem connection and call 
Saddam Hussein every nasty word in our Arabic-English 
dictionaries. Most of the electronic market battles last 
no more than seven days; George Bush could really 
have won the war in a week.
an electronics problem. Buy
ing anything from [Defendant] 
is a mistake. He is a very tricky 
and deceiving and dishonest 
BASTAKD!!!!!!! ... Do not buy 
or\deal with this individual in 
any way or form he is a crook 
and a very dishonest human 
being. Ill get him back one 
day. Justice! That !$##@% bas
tard!!!!
This was followed by a re
sponse from the defendant 
which was equally colorful and 
was pursued by at least three 
threats of physical violence 
which followed the standard 
line: Youre a punk and a hus
tling cheat. Give back the 
money, if not I hope you get 
your ass kicked.
Normally this petty bicker
ing wouldnt interest me in the 
least, but the fact that these 
arguments are taking place in 
a public forum, and all of these 
people who presumably have 
no stake in whats transpiring 
are in the thick of it, renders 
the squabbles over high tech
nology interesting.
As far as I can tell, these
transactions really only involve 
two people, the buyer and the 
seller. But then there are all of 
these other people who would 
seem to have no stake in these 
activities other than to throw 
their hats into this little elec
tronic tongue lashing.
The United Nations looks sort 
of similar at this point doesnt 
it? It seems that involvement in 
conflict is irresistible, especially 
when there is a safe medium, 
like electronic bulletin boards, 
where people can vent their 
spleen without getting it re
moved.
Maybe this is how the United 
States government should settle 
its differences with the Middle 
East. Well send them a work
station and a modem connection 
and call Saddam Hussein every 
nasty word in our Arabic-En
glish dictionaries. Most of the 
electronic market battles last no 
more than seven days; George 
Bush could really have won the 
war in a week.
From reading all of these 
things on the electronic bulletin 
boards, and I have read most or
all of them, its interesting that 
no one has any shame about 
making a complete ass out of 
himself. (All of the participants 
are male by the way.) If youre 
interested in reading the com
plete compendium of foul words 
in the English language, Ive got 
copies of almost all of these com
munications, including my fa
vorite one:
I agree why dont we all go 
out and kick this [Defendant] , 
guys ass... sure... why not? I got 
an hour to kill... Then lets kick , 
that [Other spectator/partici
pant] guys ass, sure, why not, 
he seemed to post the most mes
sages ... after that well kick ev
erybody elses ass ... I love this, ! 
regress back to the mid-evil jus
tice system ... its beautiful ... ! 
Hey man, tough shitSurvival 
of the fittest.
I wonder what Saddam would 
say.

The Merchant of Venice glistens with originality

suitors. Although Portia is a dominant female character she is, 
ironically enough, overshadowed by a mens rules; she is forced to 
abide by her fathers means of choosing a husband. She must have 
her suitors choose from three caskets - gold, silver, and base lead 
in the search of her portrait. Whoever chooses the casket containing 
her picture is destined to become her companion. Once her mate is 
chosen, Portia shows her strength in full force in the way she helps 
Antonio and fools Bassanio.
The Merchant of Venice is a source of controversy for the modem 
reader. It is difficult to surmise from the work whether or not 
Shakespeare was prejudice, and prone to stereotyping by the way 
he constructed the fate of one the main characters, Shylock the Jew 
and some of the more minor characters. The play holds many 
opportunities for a director and actors to play upon the controversy. 
In the CMU production, Shakespeare can almost be confirmed as an 
anti-Semite and stereotypes are emphasized greatly. All of this 
adds up to a riveting performance.
The cast members compliment and bring new meaning to their 
characters. Darren J. Eliker, looking very much like a young Sean 
Connery, brings much strength into his role as the merchant 
Antonio. He portrays Antonio as a humble and kindly man  
concerned about his friends and not very conceited about his 
wealth. In many versions of the play, Antonio is portrayed as a kind 
of 16th-century yuppie. Elikers Antonio is a welcome change 
though.
Michael J. Fullers Bassanio is equally refreshing. He comes off 
not as pretentious playboy who is too sure of himself, but as a

Grattano (Michael Siracusano) and Salerio (Jeffrey Shore) accost Shylock the Jew (Jordan Berlant) in The Merchant of Venice.
All that glisters tis not gold ... unless it is the CMU drama 
departments final production of the year. The senior class produc
tion of Shakespeares The Merchant of Venice proves to be worthy 
both on the surface and beneath.
The most unique and interesting aspect about Shakespeares 
works is that they are so widely open to interpretation. Sometimes 
a directors additional creative touches enhance the piece and are 
well received by audiences. And other times, the presentation is a 
flop: Fortunately for CMU drama departments production of The 
Merchant of Venice, director Anthony McKays adaptation works 
well and highlights the talents of the senior students involved.
The Merchant of Venice tells the story of a member of the 
merchant class, Antonio, who, out of devotion to his colleague, 
Bassanio, agrees to lend him money so he can pursue the woman of 
his dreams  the wealthy and strong-willed Portia of Belmont. 
Antonio does not have the 3,000 ducats Bassanio needs, so he 
decides to borrow it from the Jewish usurer, Shylock. Shylock, a 
bitter man angered by the disrespectful treatment he has gotten 
from Antonio because of his religion, agrees to lend out the money. 
But theres a catch  if Antonio doesnt return the money at the end 
of a certain time period, he will have to sacrifice a pound of his flesh. 
Antonio accepts the terms and will later have to face the conse
quences of them.
The subplot deals with Portia of Belmonts handling of her many
sheepish, unselfish, easily-manipulated-by-female-type of guy. He 
is especially convincing in the scene in which he must choose the 
proper casket in order to win Portia and the scene where he clings 
to Antonio as he prepares to have a pound of his flesh taken by 
Shylock.
Jordan Berlants Shylock is an interesting character. Shylock is 
most definitely the most stereotyped in the play. He has that 
Jewish/Jackie Mason accent that persists throughout the play. Out 
of context, the accent is good as an identifier of the character, but 
it doesnt fit well into the play. Did Shylock immigrate to Italy from 
Poland, Russia, or Hungary? The original Shakespeare version 
says nothing of Shylocks background, but it is doubtfiil that he has 
lived anywhere but Italy.
Despite the accent, Berlant is wonderful as Shylock. He brings 
across his character as a man hardened by prejudices who will 
never find true happiness. He presents him as a man so involved 
with his money that he cannot fully understand how unhappy his 
daughter is.
Berlant shows Shylocks true character effectively in the court 
scene when Shylocks skullcap is ripped off his head. The look on 
Berlants face is full of emotion and will leave audiences speechless.
The female leads in the play are equally talented and bring forth 
evidence of different perspectives about the Shakespearean play. 
Beth A. Zumann portrays Portia with the energy and spark needed 
for the part. In her first scene, the audience immediately senses 
that she is the female in control. In some interpretations of The' 
Merchant of Venice, Portia sheds some of her more feminine 
qualities (besides the fact that she disguises herself as male judge) 
in the court scene. Thereis always much discussion as to how Portia 
must conceal her sex in order to have total control, but from 
Zumanns portrayal, the modern audience can see, even through 
the disguise, that the female is still very much in control. If 
Shakespeare had attuned his characters to such a portrayal, they 
would have been able to identify her in her suit.
Portias sidekick, her maidNerissa, is played by Kelly Q, Bertrand. 
Her role is really no different in this production than what is seen 
in others. She plays the part with much spirit though, and confirms 
the importance of her role in the plot.
The role of Jessica is certainly one of the more interesting ones in 
this version of The Merchant of Venice. There is much ad-libbing in 
this part played by Sara Mornell. In the beginning, Jessica is quite 
conventional. She wishes desperately to get away from her father 
Shylock, away from the locked windows and doors of her home, and 
away from her religion. In most instances, the character of Jessica 
is not seen to regret leaving her father behind for a life with a 
Christian husband. But Mornells Jessica seems a bit more hesi
tant and doubtful. She appears to be unsure of her husband 
Lorenzos love for her, as evident in her scene with him in the 
Belmont courtyard. Also, when she hears of her fathers fate, she is 
quite taken aback and upset. She appears to have a guilt complex. 
This is definitely an interesting interpretation. Mornells convinc
ing expressions make the audience feel sympathy for her character.
The smaller roles are the ones that hold the most stereotypical 
characteristics. Jeffrey Shore and Walter Elder play Salerio and 
Solanio  the main gossipers of the story. They are shown to be 
equal in character in their appearance. Both have the 18th century 
white-faced makeup, wigs, and beauty marks. They walk around 
drinking and poking into everyones business. Shore and Elder are 
perfect for these parts and are hilarious.
The comic relief for the play is Eric Jensen, who plays Gobbo, 
Shylocks servant. He mocks his master, plays tricks on his blind 
father, and imitates several types of characters. Jensen presents 
him as a standup comedian so driven to make the audience laugh.
Lorenzo, played by Ferrell Barron, is the typical money monger, 
in this production. One is unsure about whether or not he truly 
loves Jessica. Barron is charming and his looks fit the part.
Antonio and Bassanios friend, Gratiano, portrayed by Michael 
Siracusano, also fits into a stereotyped role. He plays the woman
izer and follower of the group. Whatever his friends do, he does 
too. He also talks incessantly. He speaks of an infinite deal of 
nothing as Bassanio says.
Other characters played to the hilt are the Prince of Morocco 
(Brent Jefferson Lowe) and the Prince of Aragon (Carl DeGregorio). 
The Prince of Moroccos presence in Portias home is announced in 
Portias home by his personal drummer. He is dressed in garish, 
outlandish robes and holds up two fingers for peace as he enters the 
room. His exuberance pokes fun at his royalty. The Prince of 
Morocco is presented as the typical Hollywood Don Juan  accent 
and all.
The cast and director are not the only people who make this 
production of The Merchant of Venice work so well. The lighting, 
costumes, and set design enhance the play and set the mood for 
each scene.
The lighting is most beautiful during the scene in whichLorenzo 
and Jessica are sitting in the garden. It is a nighttime setting, and 
the lights are dimmed to such a point that one could just imagine 
a small courtyard such as the one on stage being cascade'! bv bright 
moonlight. To the laymans eyes, the light is realistic.
The costumes arecolorful and detailed to fit into the 18th century 
period. The best co stumes and makeup by far are seen on the 
Salerio and Solanio who were all done up in their facial makeup, 
white wigs, and britches. They looked like they were right out 
Dangerous Liasions. The rest of the cast is adorned in britches,

shiny vests, attractive gowns, corsets, etc.
The set is simple, but serves its purpose. The set is a basic 
courtyard and balcony. The stairs and balcony give the look of 
marblelized stone in rich tones of brown and dark reds. Vines are 
draped over the balcony and stairs. The small amount of furniture 
on stage allows for the acts to move more smoothly into one 
another.
Overall, The Merchant of Venice is an unusual treat that should 
be savored. The interpretationis quite interesting. The show runs 
till May 2, so be sure to get your taste of Shakespeare. Seize what 
glisters before it fades.

Acne-scarred rebel without a cause seeks purpose in life
Peter Bagges Hate is the 
comic that is secretly about you. 
The story of a bachelor and his
- loopy roommates in a small Se
attle hovel is intensely outra
geous, yet frighteningly realis
tic. Par Lagerkvist once said that 
humans delight in seeing reflec
tions of themselves in clouded 
mirrors. The little kick you get 
out of that is the energy behind 
Hate.
Buddy Bradley, a 24- year-old 
Bart Simpson with acne scars 
and no real job, is the central 
character. He stands as a glow
ing example of Loserus Twentysomethingus, a peculiar crea
ture that we all live in fear of 
becoming sooner or later. If you 
cant find yourself relating to 
Buddy, there are plenty of other 
characters and other categories 
that youll be surprised you fit 
into.
Buddys closest pal, Stinky, 
is a cheapskate who lives in the 
small kitchen pantry and pays 
$75 rent per month because hes 
never home, a veritable man on 
the go and party animal. He 
squabbles over pretzel sticks and 
never finishes any project.
Stinky is the ultimate mooch, 
with no redeemable qualities 
whatsoever. But miraculously, 
unexplainably, he has created 
an acceptable social life.
Buddy and Stinky are co-dependent losers, nurturing each 
other with a brotherly love that 
can only be expressed by bash
ing each other. Its the only way 
these two repressed hipsters 
with poor posture can relate to 
each other.
Stink/s hare-brained schemes 
occasionally land the two of them 
in impossible situations. This 
may sound like a network sitcom, 
but sometimes Hate takes on 
that cheesy aura.
Although the book sometimes 
loses its balance; Bagges rau
cous wit saves the day, even in 
the dullest of situations. In a

Not a very ingenious plot twist,

these relationships are impor

Perhaps the most interesting 
character of all is Buddys mys

Hamilton. He is a wormy type of

George deals with his alien

staying locked up in his room

letters to Omni magazine. His 
best friend is the TV these days, 
sad to say, and his intellectual 
rationalizations for watching so

DH2210 reels in Carnegie Mellon Student Film Festival
By WASEEM HUSSAIN
Tartan Senior Staffwriter
This Thursday night in 
Doherty Hall marks the start of 
a new tradition, the Carnegie 
Mellon Student Film Festival. 
It features over twenty studentmade films, ranging in content 
from documentaries on Pitts
burgh prostitution to MTVesque animated shorts.
The idea for the festival be
gan last spring when the Carn
egie Mellon Film Club was first 
formed. Sophomore information 
and decision systems major Paul 
Maya, the current president of 
the' club, says that the motiva
tion behind the festival was to 
get peoples films shown on cam
pus. We were hoping that if there
was such a thing around, it would 
motivate people to make their 
own films, that it would give 
them something to shoot for. 
(No pun intended!)
Maya and his colleagues, jun
ior mechanical engineering ma
jor Jon Walsh and sophomore 
art and English double major 
Alex Henry have contributed the 
beginnings of a major documen
tary, based on the lives of the 
crew members of the submarine 
U.S.S. Requin, to the festival. 
The submarine is currently on 
display at the Carnegie Science 
Center. The idea of the film came 
from Walsh, who, while waiting 
in a long line to enter the subma
rine, decided that it would be 
intriguing to create a documen
tary for people to watch while

waiting in line.
The four-minute documentary 
features several starkinterviews 
with the Navy veterans who 
served on the ship. The sub never 
got the chance to engage in com
bat because as it set out on its 
very first mission, World War II 
came to an end.
Subsidized by a Small Under
graduate Research Grant 
(SURG), Maya and his col
leagues interviewed veterans of 
the ship from Pennsylvania to 
Massachusetts. When the documentaiy is fully completed, the 
group hopes to enter it into na
tional competitions and expects 
that it will find a home in the 
Carnegie Science Center as well.
The Requin entry is one of 
many films that have been shot 
on video. Many of the computer 
animated and special effects 
music videos are on tape as 
well and will be shown via video 
projector.
The animation showcases a 
number of techniques used in 
computer animation, and many 
of the music videos have origi
nal scores produced by students. 
The videos run between two and 
four minutes long, and serve as 
colorful transitions between the 
festivals longer pieces.
Dreams, by fourth year drama 
major Brent Lowe, is one of the 
longer pieces. Amidst a surreal 
atmosphere, ayounggir] dreams 
of being stalked by a mysterious 
satanic figure. Is it a dream? 
Presented in a stream-of-consciousness format, this peculiar 
film is representative of the 
overall dark tone of many of the 
longer videos.
Andrew Stern and David 
Iversens Severe Conditions is 
the festivals longest video, run
ning almost a half an hour. Shot 
in rural North Carolina, it tells 
the grisly story of a murdered 
woman and the Movie-of-theWeek-esque circumstances lead
ing to it.
Though these films will not be 
winning any Academy Awards 
in the near future, the fruits of 
the artists painstakinglabor are 
easy to appreciate. Sharp edit
ing, vibrant music, and creative 
cinematography are charac
teristics of all the video films.
The super 8 mm short films 
are far more diverse in content. 
Junior English major Michael 
Gabriels documentary The Traf
fic of Tricks is a stark portrayal 
of street life in Pittsburgh. Done 
for Judith Modells class on eth
nographic film, the story, shown 
in black and white, features the 
observations of a young black 
man about hookers engaging in 
their trade in downtown Pitts
burgh. The documentary is a 
refreshing, educational slice of 
fife that is very effective in por
traying a reality that we often 
dont see.
On the lighter side is a short 
comedy by the festival organ
izer, senior math major Ben 
Schoenberg. The film portrays 
the plightofaheroicofficedrone 
who gets locked out of his build
ing. Will he get back in before an 
impending deadline passes?The 
tragically comedic attempts to 
get back in are deftly portrayed 
by Scotch N Soda veteran, se
nior English major Mick Sutter. 
The seven minute comedy is one

of the few films which actually 
portrays student acting. It is 
one of the rare, purely storydriven films in the entire festi
val and is sure to gamer a grin 
or two.
CMU students dont often get 
a chance to see the cinematic 
works of fellow students on such 
a grand scale. The festival is a 
refreshing celebration of cre
ativity and artistic expression.
The sheer novelty of the occa
sion is enough reason to attend! 
After all, where else do you get 
to see body limbs for breakfast, 
living lunch boxes, murders on 
the golf course, or CMITs own 
version of Spinal Tap? Such di
versity in one sitting is unheard 
of in this day and age!
How frequently do you get to 
see people you know or places
youve been on the big screen? 
Film locales range from the 
Mudge courtyard to the bowels 
of Wean Hall.
People youve walked by on 
the way to class or in the dining 
halls will be on public display in 
Doherty Hall!
This is a festival for the stu
dents, by the students. Support 
for the festival can only lead to 
bigger and better things next 
year.
Treat yourself to a unique 
event and support the cinematic 
endeavors of CMU students at 
the same time. The 1992 Carn
egie Mellon Student Film Festi
val is playing in Doherty Hall 
2210 this Thursday, April 23.
Next year maybe youll take 
the opportunity to take out the 
old movie camera and shoot.

The official 1991  92 televi
sion season ended on April 12. It 
was both typical and atypical: 
the number one series, 60 Min
utes, has been a Top 10 resident 
for over a decade, but the num
ber one network, CBS, leapt from 
the depths on the strength of 
major sporting events and popu
lar sitcoms.
Comedy once again proved it
self king, with seven of the top 
10 entries. However, reality 
TV keeps gaining in popularity. 
This frightening genre seems to 
produce a new spinoff every 
night, and each reality entry 
finished solidly in the ratings. 
Drama, meanwhile, has all but 
disappeared: only one drama 
(Murder, She Wrote) finished in 
the top 25 (two, if you count 
Northern Exposure).
As a tribute to this past TV 
season, I offer the First (and 
Last) Annual Laugh Track 
Awards. The good, the bad, the 
highs, the lows, the memorable, 
the forgettable: its all here.
 The M*A*S*H Longevity 
Award: To Cheers, still making 
America laugh as it enters its 
eleventh season. Sam and the 
gang have earned their place as 
television legends.
 The Facts of Life Longevity 
Award (note the subtle differ
ence): To Whos the Boss and 
Growing Pains. These typical 
family laughers wore out their 
welcome a couple of years ago. 
Their departures later this 
month will be a time for rejoic
ing instead of mourning.

Other strong tracks on the al
bum include The Sun Always 
Shines On TV, Here I Stand 
And Face The Rain, and Blue 
Sky. The lead singers vocals in 
this song are hauntingly beauti
ful.
Since the band never really 
caught on in the U.S., the al
bum is probably available for a 
reasonable price. Its certainly 
worth the trip down memory 
lane.

JACKSON
Thriller
'k'k'k'k
The man, the legend, the face 
only a plastic surgeon could love 
(because hes getting paid very 
well)... yep, its Michael Jack
son. But despite his capricious 
looks, Jackson is quite the tal
ented musician. This is espe
cially evident on his smash al
bum Thriller.
There are too many good songs 
to name off this album. Almost 
every track made it into the top 
ten or twenty on the billboard 
charts. Some of the more memo
rable ones include the title track 
(whose video had some of the 
best cinematography in its time), 
Billie Jean, which highlights 
Jacksons high-pitched emo
tional voice as he croons about a 
woman who thinks her son is 
his, and Beat It, the quintes
sential tough guy song. Jackson 
seems to love this theme alot. 
Its evident on other albums.
Whats best about Thriller is 
that it will make you recall that 
wonderful dance called the 
moonwalk. Soon youll find your
self sliding across floors.

one of the lowest-rated. CBS is

played  few other Andrew 
games leave the player glued to 
the screen with fingers tapping 
compulsively on the multiple 
mouse buttons. Its netrek, the 
most popular computer game 
by far at CMU. Despite restric
tions on the game in clusters  
such as not allowing the game 
to be played at certain hours, 
the game is still popular. Each 
month, over 200 different people 
play at least one game.
In the game, one of five ships 
can be chosen: Scout, Destroyer, 
Cruiser, Battleship, or Assault. 
The sixth ship, Starbase, is usu
ally only available to experi
enced players. There are two 
weapons, photon torpedoes, or 
torps, which are akin to small 
bombs, and phasers, a lasertype weapon.
Also, there are tractors and 
pressors, which are respectively 
used to pull and push a ship. 
Each ship can fly, and has a 
certain range of speeds (higher 
speeds make the ship less ma
neuverable). These are the tools 
of dogfighting, which is an im
portant part of the game. Once 
there are eight players or more, 
though, the game switches to 
team mode.
Atypical game starts off with 
two teams of 4 to 8 players 
each, each team representing a 
race. The four races are Federa
tion, Romulan, Klingon, and 
Orion. Each team starts off with 
10 planets, with 30 armies on 
each planet.
The object is to try to take the 
other teams planets by bomb
ing down the armies and pick
ing up your own armies to even
tually beam down onto their 
planets.
When a team takes all of an
other teams planets, the losing 
team is genocided. The losing 
team then comes back as an
other race.
Ships can also cloak (hide), 
but cant fire weapons while 
cloaked. This combination of 
ship abilities complicates the 
game immensely.

THE LAUGH TRACK
by A. Franklin Wheeler
Alienation Award: To NBC. The 
Peacock network, quickly losing 
its feathers, gave away a few 
more when it cancelled old 
(but popular) series, including 
Matlock, In the Heat of the Night, 
and The Golden Girls, in favor of 
shows that appeal to younger 
audiences. As CBS and ABC reap 
the benefits of NBCs hits, the 
former number one will give new 
meaning to the term basement 
dweller.
Runner-up: Parker Lewis Cant 
Lose, which, in an attempt to 
attract an older, more sophisti
cated audience, slowed down the 
music and the action, and lost 
the hyper zaniness that made it 
something special.
 The Dear John Time Slot is

ripoff (with Suzanne Somers and 
Patrick Duffy, no less!) rode the 
coattails jof Family Matters to a 
successful finish.
 The Sesame Street Which

individual games.
ter the art of planet taking and 
bombing. Ogging, (which is 
cloaking, charging at an enemy, 
un-cloaking next to them, then 
killing them) is also a very im
portant skill.
The most important aspect of 
netrek is team cooperation. A 
good player communicates with 
his team by sending messages to 
the team telling what hes do
ing, and what he thinks others 
should be doing. Doing this, joint 
missions can be made. For in
stance, a few people can clear an 
area before others go in to take 
planets. Messages can be sent to 
a teammate, to another team, or 
to everyone.
People play netrek for a vari
ety of reasons, stress relief be
ing predominant. Some people 
play to relieve stress and be
cause they like the feeling of 
annihilating something.
Also, similar to sports, there 
are numerous netrek statistics 
to discuss, rangingfrom the fuelcapacity of each ship, to the mili
tary ranks of each player, to the 
merits of each ship.
Die hard netrek players form 
teams and practice working to
gether. This year, six CMU 
teams were organized and
played a round robin tourna
ment among themselves.
There are also 14 Inter-colle 
giate Netrek League teanis, with 
three at CMU. Other schools 
include Berkeley, Reed, Duke, 
University of Pennsylvania. 
These teams hold tournament 
games approximately every 
week.
In a tournament game, the 
whole team is together in room, 
and instead of sending electronic 
messages, they talk. This in
creases team cooperation im
mensely, and makes the games 
fast and tense.
There are many netrek serv
ers located throughout the world 
to play on, but in general, people 
play on servers that are geo
graphically close because the 
animation rates are faster.
To play netrek, log onto a DEC 
station in a public cluster and 
type ~games/bin/netrek in a 
typescript or xterm.
If the game is full, youll get a 
wait queue box with a number 
representing the number of 
people ahead of you. If you have 
any problems, ask your friendly 
C-con or netrek-playing neigh
bor for help. Give the game a try, 
but be careful, its addicting.

EXPLORING PITTSBURGH
Yggdrasil (ig* dre sil)  the great ash tree in Norse Mythology 
whose roots and branches hold together the universe and whose 
realm encompasses all aspects and forms of being, including the 
past, present, and future.
Under the Yggdrasil is the name of the fiber arts store and design 
center that exudes the very essence of this myth. Back in October, 
when CMU students were settling into the routine of classes and 
college life, proprietor Lynne Marie Cotton was getting ready to 
open one of the most visually unusual and creative shops in 
Pittsburgh.
After making many connections with artists, craft groups and 
guilds from all over the northeast, Cotton was able to fill the space 
with work (not an inch of the store is barren) guaranteed to provoke 
endless oohs and aahs from customers. In fact, just standing in 
Under the Yggdrasil is about as fun as being in the midst of gifts on 
Christmas morning, when you have that giddy awe-filled feeling of 
not knowing which present to open first.
There are 86 artists represented, all of which do some mighty 
funky things with material. There are hand-painted silk ties which 
are great for women (suits and ties are the absolute rage for this 
spring), woven and painted wall hangings, contemporary quilts 
that can be seen hanging from ceiling racks, Japanese screens, 
painted pillows, and quilted and painted jackets and tote bags. 
These are all things that can really liven up a drab dorm room or 
apartment for those lacking a decorative touch.
Under the Yggdrasil also has handmade jewelry and paper (some 
jewelry is even made of fabric and paper) and free form baskets. But 
some of the coolest items are the custom chess sets, whose boards 
are made with pictures the customer can supply. These have the 
potential of being humorous gifts  if you use your imagination.

Yggdrasil carries items of the past, present and future.
Because new types of artwork are continually coming into the 
store, there are shows held in the early evening about every six 
weeks. On April 24, there will be a show entitled Conversational 
Seating, which features hand-painted upholstery and furniture 
by two Pittsburgh fiber artists, one of them being the owner. V,
So, stop at Under the Yggdrasil and check it out. The store is 
located at 311 South Craig Street, and is open Monday through ' 
Saturday from 11 am to 6 pm.

Spinal Tap is essentially a con
voluted series of inside jokes, 
and if you dont have the re
quired background, youre go
ing to miss each and every one of 
them. Break Like the Wind, Taps 
newest foray into rock satire, is 
not so much a new product as an 
extension of a seven-year-old 
gag. If you clamber on the 
Tapmania haywagon without 
acquainting yourself with the 
groups history, youre liable to 
miss the point of the band en
tirely.
The proper path towards 
achieving Tap Enlightenment 
starts at your local West Coast 
Video, or equivalent purveyor of 
VCR chow, where you may rent 
Rob Reiners 1984 film This Is 
Spinal Tap. The movie takes 
the form of a mid-eighties MTVstyle rockumentary, replete 
with sound bites, concert foot
age, incoherent band member 
interviews, and similar fare.
Somewhere down the line it 
will dawn on you that strange 
things are afoot. The band be
comes lost under a stage in 
Cleveland. When a gig in Boston
 falls through, the manager of
fers consolation by stating that 
its not a big college town. The 
group jerks out tunes withnames 
like Sex Farm and Big Bot
tom, with lyrics that seem too 
strategically ridiculous to in fact 
be genuine.
Congratulations! Youve just
been let in on one of the most 
elaborate fun-poking efforts in 
movie history. This is Spinal 
Tap is utter satire, a deliberate 
jab at the self-absorption and 
laughable pretentiousness of the 
rock industry.
The group Spinal Tap is an 
utter fiction, devised for the pur
pose of parody. In real life, it 
doesnt exist. Or does it? Nobody 
will deny that David St. Hubb1992 MCA Records Inc.
ins, Nigel Tufnel, and Derek 
Smalls are better known as 
Michael McKean, Christopher 
Guest, and Harry Shearer, re
spectively. But the difference 
between joke and truth seems 
very insubstantial these days. 
The group has been interviewed 
on Letterman, leers from the 
cover of Rolling Stone, and is 
actually performing concerts. 
The media treats Tap as if it 
was the real McCoy, happily 
going along with the joke.
Tap is back, and their per
verse success has afforded them 
fourteen new tracks, which, far
from the muddy tunes on the 
original album, sport as much 
production quality and studio 
magic as any Guns n Roses 
screamer. The real question is 
whether or not the group can 
maintain itsfarcical tone, 
unsustained by the overt com
edy that a movie could provide.
Their success is certainly not 
obvious. Much like the movie 
soundtrack, several relisten
ings are necessary before the 
album elicits anything other 
than a weak smile. At first, all 
one hears is blaring, second-rate 
rock  perhaps with a catchy 
hook here or there. After a few 
tracks, however, the humorous 
effect begins to set in.
The first thing thatll draw 
your attention is the lyrics. Af
ter a cursory reading, youll re
alize that theyre too exagger
ated and self-indicting to be any
thing but a mockery. The Maj
esty of Rock, a bombastic an
them-like tribute to rock and 
roll, shouts The majesty of rock/ 
The mystery of roll/ The darn
ing of the sock/ The scoring of 
the goal.
In the alien, Arabic Clam 
Caravan, Nigel Tufnel croons, 
Its only the heartiest bloom/ 
The can blossom in darkest 
Khartoum/ So I will just stay in 
my room/Tonight. Nothing that 
would send you into hysterical 
convulsions, but enough to make 
you grin appreciatively when 
you realize the sort of omnipres
ent material its meant to copy.
Some of the humor is less
subtle. Christmas with the /. 
Devil sports lines like The elves 1 
are dressed in leather/ And the ! 
angels are in chains/ The sugar " 
plums are rancid/And the stock> 
ings are in flames. And when 
one reaches the untitled track o 
13, a horrid ballad describing r; 
the plight of a euthanasia candi1 
date (who lies with his pee-pee < 
and poo-poo slipping out through 
a hose) then the humorous in
tent of the album, if not its taste, 
is unquestionable.
Diehard Tap fans will also be 
treated with some nostalgia. On 
the album is a scratchy, sixties^ 
style recording of All the Way ^ 
Home, a Spinal Tap oldie men. 
tioned briefly in the movie.
Spinal Taps popularity is in . 
one sense a sad reflection on the 
state of the music industry. Its 
more than slightly depressing 
that an entirely fictitious group 
is far more entertaining  and , 
original  than most serious 
artists.
One might imagine the day , 
when the music world is so far .. 
gone that Taps sly ridicule is 
mistaken for the real thing. 
Nonetheless, we can still chuckle 
along to Break Like the Wind, 
and prolong the well-needed joke , 
as long as we are able, by a. 
simple suspension of disbelief.
As we listen to Spinal Taps 
tumultuous offerings, let us remember the sagacity of former J 
Tap keyboardist Viv Savage who 
told us to Have a good time  
all the time. And thats my phi
losophy, Marti.

CMU Student Film Festival
Its time for CMUs directors, producers, and 
actors to make their debut on the big screen at DH 
2210. Its not a Hollywood screening room, but it is 
a start.
The films being shown at the film festival are 
shorts dealing with subjects from the conventional 
to the unusual. One short film is a documentary 
about the U.S.S. Requin on display at the Carnegie 
Science Center, one deals with a young girl plagued 
by a devilish figure, and another covers the issue of 
prostitutes in Pittsburgh. There are other exciting 
entries as well.
With a large variety of films being shown on 
screen, you are bound to keep your eyes glued to the 
screen. You dont always need a big time director to 
get a quality flick. Go support future artists.
At 6, 8,10.
Friday, April 24
Beauty and the Beast
Heres a cartoon love story that is bound to mys
tify you. The animation is fabulous and the storyline 
reminiscent of all those prince and princess stories 
your Mom and. Dad used to read to you before 
bedtime.
The Academy Award-winning Beauty and the 
Beast unravels the tale of an attractive young girl, 
Belle, who befriends the rough Beast after he im
prisons her in his castle. The big question is, what 
will become of the Beast if Belle were instead to fall 
in love with him?
The musical score itself is enough reason to go see 
this picture. The songs have a Broadway quality and 
are farther enhanced by the wonderful images on 
the screen. This is an opportunity that shouldnt be 
passed up. Open up that old bedtime story book 
again....
At 6, 7:30, 9,10:30, midnight.
Saturday, April 25
JFK
Oliver Stone has made his mark as a director who 
produces controversial works, and his film JFK 
definitely signifies this. Then again, the subject of 
President Kennedys death is a controversy in itself.
Kevin Costner plays a district attorney who be
lieves that the Kennedy assassination goes a bit 
beyond the Lee Harvey Oswald theory. He has a 
little trouble getting people to cooperate with his 
investigation, though. The audience will be left with 
a lot of questions by the end of this picture with its 
ideas about the situation a bit clouded over.
Costner is effective in his role as the adamant and 
determined attorney, and the supporting cast with 
the likes of Joe Pesci and Sissy Spacek are equally 
as effective.
At 5:45 pm, 9 pm, 12:15 am.
Sunday, April 26
Coming to America
Eddie Murphy and Arsenio Hall pair for this 
hilarious picture about a prince of a small African 
country seeking a wife in the less impressive parts 
of America. The storyline is, of course, completely 
ridiculous, but Murphy and Hall make up for it with 
their onscreen chemistry.
Murphy plays a prince who insists on choosing his 
own wife rather than having his parents pick one 
out for him. He decides to come to the U.S. to find the 
girl of his dreams. And what does he consider the 
most majestic place to find one? You got it, Queens, 
N.Y. Murphy sheds his pretentious title and begins 
working as a janitor for a fast food joint, while Hall 
flaunts his wealth in a far-from-wealthy apartment 
building.
Look for Murphy and Hall in different roles be
sides their main ones in the film. And there might 
even be a couple of other cameos in there worth 
checking out.
