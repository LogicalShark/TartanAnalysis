Recycling
By DUANE EILERTSON
Each day in Allegheny Coun
ty, private individuals and insti
tutions alike produce an estimat
ed 5000 tons of trash. Much of 
this trash, metal, glass and 
paper, for example, could be re
used with comparitively little ef
fort. Modern industry has reach
ed such a great output and is ex
pending resources at such an 
ever-increasing rate, that the 
time has come to worry about 
the availability of future resourc
es.
One group which is making a 
successful attempt to solve this 
problem is GRIP (Group Recy
cling In Pittsburgh). The organ
ization was founded by a Pitt 
professor who had participated 
in a similar program at Berkley.

Student seats on College Coun
cils are up for election (Or reelection as the case may be). 
Petitions can be obtained from 
departments. The number of 
seats open in each College is 
different. Heres the breakdown:
CIT two student reps. One 
from Chemical Engineering (de
partment rotation) and one rep
at-large. A similar system is 
anticipated for MIS, but check 
with your department.
H&SS must elect two Sophomores, 
two Juniors, and two Seniors.
FINE ARTS needs one student 
per department.
All terms of office will be for 
one year. Responsibilities gen
erally include such things as 
showing up for all College 
Council meetings, and discuss
ing and voting one College pol
icies. This is a major responsi
bility, and elected representa
tives ar expected to fulfill 
these obligations seriously.
Another important function 
of elected representatives are to 
meet as many people in their 
constituency (students, faculty, 
and administration) as possible. 
It puts you in the valuable posi
tion of interpreting student views 
to faculty, and representing ad
ministrative views to students.
Although these positions are 
important, they do not consume 
an excessive amount of time.
Students running for seats in 
a given College Council must 
be a member of the constituencies 
as defined. Candidates must sub
mit petitions with at least 25 
signatures of students who are 
members of the candidates con
stituency as defined in order 
for his name to appear on the 
ballot. Write-in candidates will 
count. ELECTIONS WILL BE 
HELD MARCH 8 and 9; PETI
TIONS ARE DUE AT 4:30 p.m.

burgh, GRIP collects materials 
that are valuable on todays re
cycling market, processes them, 
and transports them to the plac
es where they can be reused. 
Materials that the group accepts 
for recycling are:
1. newspaper and computer 
paper, tied in bundles.
2. computer cards and corru
gated cardboard.
3. aluminum cans and foil, 
rinsed and crushed.
4. glass containers, clear, am
ber and green glass (no 
blue or opaque glass), thor
oughly rinsed of food parti
cles.
5. tin cans, rinsed, with the la
bels removed. Bottoms and 
tops of the cans may be re
moved and placed inside 
the can before flattening. 
This will facilitate handling.
Bottles are crushed by GRIP 
into a more transportable form, 
and brought to the Glenshaw 
Glass works where they bring 
$20 a ton as starter glass. Crush
ed cans and metal bring $25 a 
ton. The used paper products 
are hauled off to the junkyard in 
a Salvation Army truck where 
they are inevitably sent back 
to the paper mills for reuse.
GRIP members meet every 
Sunday from 10:00 A.M. to 3:00 
P.M. in the Pgh. National Bank 
Parking lot on Fifth and Craig 
to process the material. Testi
mony to their faith in the goals 
of the project is their dedica
tion to the once-a-week program. 
After this last weeks heavy snow 
and bitter temperatures, ten bundled-up GRIP members showed 
up to process the collected re
fuse. The group is now suffi
ciently large that members need 
only donate one Sunday a month 
to the project.
One of GRIPS volunteers, Ron
ald D. Pittle, a professor in CMUs Department of Electrical 
Engineering is leading attempts 
toward campus involvement in re
cycling. He says that though the 
group usually handles five tons 
of refuse weekly, this is only a 
small amount when compared 
to the 500 tons of trash produced 
daily in Pittsburgh. The profes
sor views C-MU as a profitable 
source of recyclable materials. 
As a start, Professor Pittle has 
been collecting each weeks E.E. 
lab refuse which Department 
Head Jordan asked lab techni
cians to save for him. Still, how
ever, the professor must pick up 
the reusable rubbish and bring 
it to the processing point in his 
own car. Another of his hopes 
had been to obtain one of the 
campus vans not in use Sundays 
to collect on-campus refuse and 
bring it to the parking lot.
The main response to GRIP has 
come from private individuals 
who believe in the programs 
goals and take a few hours of 
their time to save their trash 
and bring it to GRIP on Sundays.
The response has not been all 
positive however. Individuals 
may contribute out of conscience, 
but conscience seems to disappear as soon as money is involv
ed. One restaurant owner ap
proached by Pittle admitted that 
the number of soft drink cans 
junked daily by his establish
ment ran in the 200s. Yet he 
felt he had no room for a con
tainer to collect the cans for
reuse, because if he had had the 
room, hed put in another table.
The response has been no dif
ferent on campus. Individuals 
may take the initiative, but the 
institution cannot. The Manager 
Of the Physical Plant stated

Basketball Bout
At 1:30 this Saturday in the Skibo Gym, the 70-year old Carnegie-Mellon (Tech)-University of Pittsburgh basketball rivalry will 
come to a close.
If you havent yet made plans for this Saturday afternoon, make 
sure that you reserve the time from 1:30 to 4:30 to see this contest. 
If you have made plans, cancel them and come.
Since the early 1900s C-MU and Pitt hoopsters have annually 
held an exciting battle on the Tartans home court and some of them 
have been memorable indeed.
In 1969, the Skibo Gym turned into the Skibo Arena. Tempers 
flared before the close of the first half. What started out as jump 
ball between Tartan Mark Lang and Pitts McFarland succeeded in 
emptying both benches and stands to the floor. The action was fin
ally brought under control as former C-MU star Ray Burdett 
came quietly out of the stands and re-arranged Pitts freshman 
coaches nose. The Tartans led 31-23 at halftime and finally won 68- 
64. Coach Moe Fassigner and various team members were carried 
off the floor to a very jubilant locker room.
Last year, the Tartans were looking for another win at home 
(and possibly a skirmish). Amidst the screaming and horn-blowing 
frenzied mob, at the Skibo Gym, the Tartans dropped a 76-55 deci
sion to the Panthers.
This year, this reporter, along with several other loyal C-MU 
fans felt the team was definitely robbed of another chance at vic
tory. This Saturday though, WILL be different. The largest home 
crowd of the year (est. 1500-2000) is expected, with many students 
from Pitt to watch the game. So why not take the time out and 
support the Plaid? Just watching Gene the Machine fake some guy 
out of his jock is worth the price of admission; or hearing the 
fans beat the knotholes out of the bleachers; or watching Jeff Hollis 
hit an 18-footer with nine seconds to go in the game. Watch every
one go berserko, yelling, screaming and jumping out of the stands. 
Follow Rick Ryan with his unbelievable twisting reverse layups (ed. 
note: a modification of the double-fake-Abe hook shot), or Mike Weg
ener with a move that makes his man trip himself.
This is C-MU Basketball! And if you havent been to the games 
yet, well, you dont know what a great time youre missing!
Attention Junior Women
What Is Mortar Board?
Founded in 1918 Mortar Board was the first and only national 
organization of senior college women, designed then, as now, to meet 
the needs of campus and community through service, scholarship 
and leadership. The Eta chapter of Carnegie-Mellon has been a 
tradition since 1923 and with our sister chapters at Bucknell, Case 
Western Reserve, University of Pittsburgh, Westminster, West Vir
ginia University and Chatham College we make up one of the 
twelve regions that encompass 132 college and university campus 
across the country.
What Can Mortar Board Do?
In fulfilling our motto of service, scholarship and leadership 
the possibilities for action on campus and in the community are vir
tually unlimited! Mortar Board is whatever its members wish to 
make it. Each year Eta Chapter sponsors a transfer students dinner; 
in past years regional activities have included everything from tu
torial programs, votor registration drives, lectures on birth control 
and career seminars to care packages for final exams. The Mortar 
Board chapter at the University of Pittsburgh has recently made a 
detailed study of graduate opportunities and enrollment for women 
at their school.
Who Are Mortar Board Women?
Mortar Board, as an honorary and senior society, is an associa
tion of senior women selected by their peers on the basis of distin
guished ability and achievement in scholarship, leadership, and serv
ice.
Interested?
?Please complete the application and return it no later than Wed
nesday, March 3rd to either Marita Ritter (3D3) or Barbara Lckstein (2A7).

ANNOUNCEMENTS
BOOTH TITLES TO BE 
CHOSEN WEDNESDAY
There will be a meeting of all 
booth chairmen at 4:30 P.M. on 
Wednesday, February 24, in Room 
46, Skibo. The purpose of this 
meeting is to select the titles and 
lot locations of the individual 
booths. It is therefore imparitive 
that all organizations be repre
sented at this meeting.
Preference in picking booth 
title and Midway position will be 
determined by drawing numbers. 
There will be two separate draw
ings, one for the competitive or
ganizations and one for the non
competitive groups. Competitive 
organizations will pick their 
themes first, in the order of the 
numbers that have been drawn. 
Midway lots will then be chosen 
in reverse order. Non-competitive 
groups will then pick their booth 
titles and Midway position in a 
similar manner. Similarity be
tween a non-competitive and com
petitive booth theme is discour
aged.
Because of the selection proce
dure, each chairman is advised 
to come to the meeting with at 
least three (3) choices for booth 
title and three (3) choices for po
sitions on the Midway. Any or
ganization not represented at the 
meeting will automatically re
ceive last choice in both selec
tions. It is therefore impari
tive that ail organizations be rep
resented at the meeting at 4:30 
P.M. on Wednesday, February 24, 
in Room 46, Skibo.
SENIOR BANQUET
The CMU Alutnni Association is 
holding its annual Senior Banquet 
on Wednesday, March 3rd, 1971 
at 5:30 p.m. in the Skibo Ball
room. All seniors are invited to 
attend and to enjoy the free steak 
dinner. As has been the practice 
in the last several years, there 
will be no speeches and the pro
gram should end by 7:30 p.m. The 
after dinner program consists 
of a short multi media production. 
The program is an excellent pro
duction consisting of slide show, 
music tract, and narration.
This short program was ex
tremely popular with the Classes 
of 1969 and 1970, and many 
schools across the country have 
used it recently. The Alumni As
sociation would like to see every 
senior attend the banquet and ad
vanced reservations would seem 
to indicate that there will be 
even more than the 500 seniors 
who attended last year.
Reservations can be made by 
stopping at the Alumni Office, 
5th floor, Warner Hall. Tickets 
will be required for the banquet 
this year and will be mailed to 
most students who live on campus. 
Off campus students and those 
who have not received a ticket 
prior to the banquet should pick 
them up in the Alumni Office.
Reservation deadline is noon 
on Monday, March 1st.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
LABOR
To the Editor:
The Amalgamated Clothing 
Workers Union (AFL-CIO) has 
been on strike against Reidboard 
Brothers Clothing Manufacturers 
since September 7, 1970. The 
strike was provoked by unfair 
labor practices. Reidboards poli
cies have included no wage in
creases without government pres
sure on the clothing industry and 
time restrictions on rest room 
use.
In the face of the strike, Reid
board has attempted to continue 
normal production by using scab 
labor. However, this practice has 
not met with complete success 
the work force is only half its 
normal size.
On Tuesday, February 16, 
eight C-MU students joined the 
picket line and were warmly re
ceived. The striking workers 
picket every day from 7:00 A.M. 
to 5:00 P.M. Organizers of the 
strike have asked for support in 
the form of mass picketing on 
Tuesday afternoons between 4:15 
and 5:00. During this time per
iod the scabs and foremen must 
cross the picket line.
In order to show solidarity with 
the Reidboard strikers, join their 
picket line next Thursday at 
Centre and Morewood. For more 
information contact the Y Office 
for Community Affairs in Skibo 
Room 57.

FENCED
The Tartan,
Thursday night I went out to 
paint the fence concerning the 
city-wide anti-war conference 
that was to be held Saturday at 
Skibo. When I got there the 
fence was claimed by PiKa
pledges. They and individuals with 
decision-making power within 
the fraternity refused to grant 
me the right to paint one side of 
the fence. Their message, which 
allegedly could not be postpon
ed was PiKa PLEDGES CHAL
LENGE ALL OTHER PLEDGES 
TO ANYTHING THEY WANT.
Monday night I set out again. 
Gulf Oil was recruiting on cam
pus Thursday, and I wanted to 
write a summary of their activities and the universitys connec
tion to Gulf. For seven years 
Mozambicans have been waging 
a war of national liberation 
against their Portuguese coloniz
ers. A significant portion of the 
territory has been liberated, but 
the liberators have had to face 
bombardment by American-made 
planes and napalm. Gulf Oil 
pays 20% of Portugals military 
budget through taxes. A similar 
struggle has developed in An
gola, and the recent Portuguese 
invasion of Guinea is well-known. 
Gulf has also profited from the 
war in Vietnam by making bomb
er fuel and through its holdings 
in American client states in the 
area. This university owns a bloc 
of Gulf stock, and Gulf executives 
are members of the Board of 
Trustees.
Monday night Beta pledges re
fused to allow me any fence 
space to mention some of these 
details. They wrote. Beta IS NO. 1, and their names all 
over one side of the fence. I 
painted, GULF KILLS AFRI
CANS, on one of the tree. Later 
that night SAE pledges repainted 
the fence and sabotaged my message to read GULF KILLS 
CANS. I wonder if the racism 
of the SAE pledges and politi
cal irresponsibility expressed 
by the other two pledge classes 
is typical of this campus.
Peace,Chris Thein
MOVED
Editor, The Tartan:
As members of a fraternity at 
C-MU, we have come to the 
conclusion that The Movement 
does not represent the attitudes 
and feelings of many people in 
the fraternity community. It has 
become a forum for the chestbeating antics of a select few 
whose concept of the fraternity 
is quite different from our own. 
The commercialism of the last 
column is a good example. From 
this we can easily see how the 
misconceptions concerning the 
fraternity system develop.
Supposedly this column was to 
be a forum for the exchange 
of ideas. It isnt. We have sub
mitted articles on more than one 
occasion and have never seen 
them published. We have not seen 
any articles from other houses 
printed in this column either. 
The only channel of communicatiion to the Tartan we possess is 
through the Letters to the Editor.
As printed this column promul
gates the goals and morality of 
the stereotyped fraternity. It is 
less than worthless.

11:30  Wherrett Room
I would like to say something 
to those freshmen, sophomores and 
juniors who did not either go 
through rush or decide to pledge 
a fraternity. You may have 
heard of pledging from your 
friends who did pledge, or you 
may not have, but found your impressions of pledging from oth
er sources. Would you be inter
ested in a junior who has watch
ed the concept of pledging suf
fer radical changes from interior 
as well as exterior forces? Would 
you read one view of pledging 
from someone on the inside? If 
not, then stop now dont waste 
your time. But if you do lets 
proceed to the rear.
To set up the ground rules: I 
am one guy with my opinion on 
what is a very controversial is
sue inside the different houses. 
Each house is responsible for its 
pledge education, as each Greek 
and pledge is responsible for mak
ing the most of this getting-toknow-each - other period.
The concept of pledge educa
tion (or pledge training, if you 
wish) is one of trial and error. 
The trial aspect centers on that 
person who is willing to consid
er a fraternity. The error aspect 
depends exactly on how well the 
brothers pictured the TRUE na
ture of their brotherhood. During 
rush and in their day-to-day liv
ing with one another I think the 
pledge is in a precarious po
sition in those first few weeks of 
t his committment because 
rush does not present fraternity - 
it seems to depend on how well 
we entertain the rushees. While
we as a system entertain you as 
an individual I dont think you 
see us as a brotherhood. (Can you 
see why pledge education is so 
important  its the first view 
this rushee has of the group en
tity.)
To those who are not outside 
the fraternity structure, the 
thought of submitting to the tag 
pledge may be uncomforta
ble at best. This, of course, does 
not have to be if you are willing 
to participate, to accept and re
spect the brothers you are look
ing at. Likewise, you should as
sume they will respect your 
personal integrity as well. After 
all, whats all this brotherhood 
talk about anyway? From this 
common ground you should be 
able to make a decision for or 
against joining the organization. 
This common, or mutual respect 
of brother for pledge and pledge 
for brother is the most important 
ingredient of the developing re
lationship, and should be em
phatically stressed during pledge 
education.
Occasionally you may hear nas
ty rumors about an idiot practice 
called pledge-beating. I cant 
fully express how ridiculous this 
practice is. The best I can do is 
this  anyone who would go 
through it, deserves it.
If you have any questions, ask 
someone who pledged this year, 
or last year. Dig deeper than the 
superficiality of rush events. 
Dig deeper than the ego-food of 
bragged-about I.M. victories. Find 
out what really happens on the in
side.

DIVERSIONARY TACTICS
Traditional gospel music and 
contemporary black poetry are 
eloquently fused on Soul!, 
on Channel 13 at 10 p.m., Wed
nesday February 24.
Guests on the program are: 
Isaac Douglas and the Isaac 
Douglas Singers, the New York 
City Community Choir and poet
ess Nikki Giovanni.
This annual show is a cantata 
of black expression Miss Gio
vanni reads her poems as the 
two groups of singers perform 
spirituals.
Sometimes the singers take 
the front stage, with Miss Gio
vannis voice echoing in the 
background. Sometimes Miss 
Giovanni is in front of the cam
era accompanied by the singers. 
But there is no competition, 
only a rich blending of voices, 
music, words and feelings.
Soul!The New York City 
Community Choir, is produced 
by Ellis Haizlip at WNET, 
Channel 13, New York City and 
transmitted nationally on PBS, 
the Public Broadcasting Service.
Rush Toward Freedom
The Reverend Martin Luther 
Kings philosophy of passive 
resistance and his early efforts 
in the civil rights movement are 
examined in the third presenta
tion of the Rush Toward Free
dom series. The Non-Violent 
Creed will be aired Thursday, 
February 18, on Channel 13 at 
10:30 p.m.
The Non Violent Creed be
gins with the 1963 demonstra
tions in Birmingham, Alabama. 
This program highlights Dr. 
Kings attack on capital of seg
regation. His weapons of passive 
resistance are contrasted to the 
Birminghams police tactics 
which employed dogs and fire = 
hoses to quell the demonstra1 
tions.
iimiiiiiimiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiimiiiiiiiiiimiiimmiimiiiiiiiiiiiii
Julian Bond narrates this 
series of programs. Bonds in
volvement with the civil rights 
movement, both in his early 
days as a student participating 
on the Atlanta boycotts and his 
current position as a Georgia 
legislator, qualify him as an 
extremely adept commentator for 
the series.
Changes on the Campus
Pittsburgh born Joseph Rhodes, 
Jr., who just announced that 
he is potentially a candidate 
for the Pittsburgh City Council, 
is interviewed by Lenore Elkus on Friday, February 19, at
10-10:30 p.m. on Channel 13. 
Mr. Rhodes was the youngest 
member of the Presidents Com
mission on Campus Unrest.
The program, Conversation 
with Joseph Rhodes, Jr., ranges 
from his early days on govern
ment assignments to his present 
work as a Harvard Fellow, where 
he teaches history. The emphasis 
on the program, however, is 
Mr. Rhodes reactions to his 
recent trip throughout college 
campuses since the Scranton Re
port was released.
In the interview, Mr. Rhodes 
talks about the changes in the 
attitudes of college administra
tors and the reforms which are 
being made to bring students 
into more prominent roles in col
lege life. He also talks about the 
possibility of public service for 
him in the near future.
Viewers may recall that Mr. 
Rhodes was taken to task by 
Vice-President Agnew for speak
ing out critically about minority 
rights when he was first named 
to the Commission.

The East Hills Alumni Clan 
is looking for C-MU students to 
participate in the folksinging 
contest to be held on Saturday, 
Feb. 20 at 9 p.m. in the Faculty 
Dining Room (Skibo). Cash 
prizes will be awarded to the 
several contest winners. Any
Jim Fennell, 1971 Spring Car
nival Midway Chairman, has 
announced that the midways 
theme for this year will be 
Facets of the Fifties. Accord
ing to Webster, a Facet is 
any of a number of sides or 
aspects, as of a personality. 
The word is often used synonomously with phase, which 
applies to any of the ways in 
which something may be ob
served, considered, or pre
sented.
While making the announce
ment Jim commented that, . . . 
this is what were looking for 
the many faces of the fifties. 
The Midway Commiteee had 
considered limiting the theme 
to one aspect of this period, but 
decided not to. Such a limita
tion, the committee felt, would restrict the theme too much. By 
leaving the theme open to all 
aspects of the fifties, we hope to 
encourage diversity.
Booth themes may focus on any 
features of the Fifties that 
are reminiscent of the decade. 
Themes may spotlight historical 
events, television programs, mo
vies, sporting events, personalit
ies, or even childhood memor
ies. Appropriateness to theme 
will be judged by how well 
themes recall memories of the 
fifties. Since the theme is open 
to the entire decade, originality 
and uniqueness will be 
valued.
The committee has compiled 
a list of reference which may 
be helpful in generating 
ideas. The list can be obtained 
by calling Jim Fennell at 683- 
3529 or Phil Snyder at 687-2384. 
The committee wishes to stress 
that themes are not limited to 
ideas from these references. 
The list is offered as merely a 
supplement to your own child
hood adventures.
BY TERENCE N. PALSO
John Cassavetes new film, 
Husbands, is perhaps the fin
est example of what can best 
be described as pseudo cinema 
verite that anyone has made 
since Mr. Cassaevets directed 
Faces. To go even further, 
Husbands is, at least in the 
mind of this writer, probably 
the most genuinely honest 
American film to be released in 
recent memory.
In Husbands Cassavetes has 
captured the essence that makes 
close friendship among men the 
wonderful thing that it is. 
There is little doubt that Cassa
vetes job has been made a great 
deal easier due to the fact that 
he was directing his friends Ben 
Gazzara and Peter Falk along 
with himself. Still, it must be 
recognized that what the three 
are tying to bring across to 
their audience is ihat elusive 
quality which makes close male 
friendships function in spite of 
the personalities and quirks of 
those who are involved in the 
relationship. This quality is some
thing that is very difficult to suc
cessfully portray on the motion 
picture screen, and it is certain
ly a mark of this trio's fine acting 
ability that they are indeed able 
to bring it across with the re
markable success which they 
had. In almost every frame, and 
certainly in every sequence of 
this film, the viewer is treated 
to a remarkable analysis of 
friendship. The clowning, the 
seriousness, the quarrels, the car
ing, the desire to enjoy life to 
its fullest with close friends one 
can feel comfortable with, with 
friends one does not have to 
erect facades for, with friends 
who know and accept ones 
faultsthis is the type of relation
ship which Cassavetes has and 
is examining in his film.
Friendships of this nature 
can weather almost every sort of 
storm except for death. It is 
here, at the funeral of a very 
close friend, that the film be
gins. This death is the event that 
begins to give Gus, Harry, and 
Archie (Cassavettes, Gazzara. 
and Falk, respectively) intima
tions of mortality. From this 
opening scene until the final 
frame, all three are consciously 
and unconsciously evaluating 
what he has done with his life
interested students should con
tact Jerry Kleinman in the Al
umni Office, 5th floor Warner
Hall, by February 1 5th.
in relation to his dreams, and 
more importantly, what he will 
do with the time which he has 
left. This evaluation takes the 
form of a binge, and then a 
flight from London on board of 
which the trio departs not from 
Manhattan, but from reality.
This escape ends on a jarring 
and telling note. While discuss
ing whether or not they should 
return to their jobs and their 
wives, Gus tells Archie that 
theyll return, theyll return be
cause theyve got two wives and 
between them they have five 
kids, two houses, four garages 
and two cars. This inventory is 
one of the most disburbing 
points of the film. With it Gus 
and Archie have totaled up 
their lives to date and realize 
what they have slipped into 
Yet, unlike Gus, they are un
able to break their bonds and 
in a shattering scene the two 
return home to piece together 
their reality while they wait 
to die.
Cassavettes, Falk, and Gazzara 
give excellent performances 
which never appear more ridi
culous or get more out of hand 
than do their various parallels 
in real life. It is this quality 
which makes husbands so 
believable and so unnerving. It 
is quite possible that in this 
film the trio gives the perform
ances of their careers for they 
are tellingly and effectively 
playing themselves. Cassavetes 
method of filmmaking is to pro
vide a loose plot outline and 
then permit his actors to improve 
their way through each scene. 
Admittedly, there is the great 
danger that the result may prove 
to be a fantastic bore, but Cassa
vetes knows enough to cast 
talented, resourceful actors who 
are able to use their freedom which 
he gives them to the greatest 
possible advantage. The decis
ion to cast two of his close 
friends in this film was, with
out a doubt, a stroke of genius 
in that by doing the sort of 
little rituals and telling the 
familiar stories which all friend
ships develop, the trio is able to 
make the audience believe in 
them. Gus, Harry, and Archie 
attain three dimensions because 
the actors that portray them 
arent reciting lines, they are 
actually living through each se
quence. and it is the viewing of 
this remarkable spontanietv 
which makes Husbands such 
a fascinating experience for the 
films audience.

C-MUs Rick Ryan puts in one of his last second baskets that 
brought victory over Thiel 74-73.
Binstock
RR
HOOPERS
Last week featured two comefrom-behind efforts for the C-MU 
basketball team. The Tartans 
scored eight points in the final 
minute to stun Thiel 74-73 last 
Wednesday. Then, on Satur
day, they tied the score with 22 
seconds left, but lost to Grove City 71-67.
The Thiel game was a Sominex 
commercial for the first 35 minutes as C-MU and the Tomcats 
stayed within three points of 
each other most of the time. 
There were numerous turnovers as 
each squad was unable to build 
up a lead. However Thiel finally 
started to take the initiative and 
ran up a seven-point lead in the 
closing minutes.
The Tartans still had time to .e 
catch up but missed a number of 
key shots, which seemed to in
sure the Thiel victory. Then with 
one minute left, the C-MU press 
plus Thiels missed foul shots, 
plus a pair of baskets by Jeff 
Hollis and Rick Ryan gave the 
Tartans the impossible win. 
Hollis final jump shot from fif
teen feet sent the C-MU fans into 
a state of hysteria, but Thiel was ' 
given one last chance to win  
Nick Medica stole the ball with 
two seconds left and put up a 
35-footer. Fortunately the shot was 
way off. The game was billed 
as a shooting match between 
Gene Turner and Thiels Medi
ca, but both shot well below their 
normal percentages as Hollis led 
the Tartans with 22 points.
Saturday nights blizzard re** 
duced the number of C-MU stu
dents in attendance but the enthuiasm was still there. The out
look for this game wasnt too pro
mising, since Grove City had a 
substantial height advantage and 
they had topped us on their court 
71-48 earlier this year.
The Grovers were hitting most 
of their outside shots and, when they missed were getting two or 
three additional shots on the re
bounds. They led at halftime 35- 
28 and maintained an eight point 
margin throughout most of the game. The only thing that kept 
up the interest of the C-MU 
fans was the Gene Turner show. 
Turner, who seems to come up 
with a new move or two every 
day, literally faked the giant C 
Grove City players out of their 
athletic supporters via his scoring 
drives to the hoop.
Although they were maintain
ing their lead the entire game, 
Grove City was ordered by their 
coach to put on a semi-freeze 
with five minutes left. This stra
tegy was supposed to kill time, 
slow down the pace of the game s 
and draw out the C-MU defense. (hopefully to commit 
fouls or leave a man open under
neath), However, the strategy 
backfired as the Grove City lost 
their momentum and the C-MU 
squad began to reduce the Grov
ers lead. Gene Turner, who had 
a game high of 25 points, picked 
up his fifth personal foul within 
the final two minutes, but the ,|c 
Tartans stayed tough and tried 
to score with 22 seconds left, 
when Ed Aul and Rick Ryan each 
connected for two-pointers.
Von Linderns steal attempt re
sulted in a foul (his fifth) and G.
C.s Lamonna Hank both free 
throws to give the Grovers the 
lead with twelve seconds left. 
Then the Tartans, played for the 
tying bucket, set up a play 
which was designed to clear out 
the right side for a Jeff Hollis 
drive. But the Grove City defend
ers blocked up the area and Jeff 
was forced to take a fall away 
jump shot from the corner  and 
G.C. got the rebound and the 
game. The C-MU record is now 
5-10 with two home games re
maining against Pitt and Waynesburg.

THE VERY LAST 
CMU-PITT GAME
This Saturday will be the final varsity basketball game between 
e Carnegie (Tech/Mellon) Tartans and the Pitt Panthers. Since its 
onception in 1907, these two teams have met 120 times, for a 
ombined series record of 1;3-17, in favor of Pitt. This cross town 
ivalry is coming to a close after 64 years due to shift in emphasis. Pitt 
as chosen to escalate its athletic program and put more emphasis 
n its team while Carnegie is simultaneously de-escalating its program, 
vidently the coaching staffs and athletic departments of both schools 
eel that further encounters can no longer add anthing to their respecye season.
Whether Pitt is a fine school or not, there is a general student 
eling that Carnegie students are superior in some manner to the 
itt students. Of course this is an arbitrary feeling, not necessarily 
eld or supported by all. Two years ago the general student rivalry 
ame to a head in Skibo Gym as the two basketball teams met. 
art of the pre-game warm-up featured some Tech students paraddown the court with huge signs with anti-Pitt remarks like
400 books of green stamps, a years tuition at Pitt etc.............The
ght that broke out near the end of the half stopped when former 
artan star Ray Burdett drew blood from a Pitt coach. C-MU went 
to win the game and all the Tech students went home smiling 
nowing we had beaten Pitt physically and athletically, and someow morally.
It seems a shame to eliminate schools which require more of n effort to beat. Our contests with Pitt have been characterized 
iy ups and downs. When we won in 69 we were in an up year 
ind Pitt was in a down. Now were in a down and Pitt is in an up 
o we are going to cut them from the schedule.??
Within the past years both Pitt and C-MU have declared themelves in financial difficulty of an alarming degree. I must agree 
vith Pitts evident solution to the problem, rather than C-MUs. Its 
iasic human psychology at work. When youre alma mater is making 
iews and non-alumni speak the schools name with envy, youre 
iroud to say that you are an alumnus of that institution. Pitt has 
liscovered that a good way to get your name into the news is 
hrough your athletic program. C-MU seems to believe its easier to 
ttract attention with scholastic achievements which might be covred in the papers and on T.V. and it might not. Not so with sports. 
ihen youre winning the coverage increases. Its good for the 
tewspaper and its good for the institution, and it brings that instiuion to the attention of the alumni.
Im anticipating a larger than normal mob for this home game 
tgainst Pitt. I will speculate that an awful lot of alumni will be at 
he game. The varsity game will start after two. The JV game will 
>e at noon and if there is an alumni game it will be at 10:00 in the 
norning. The earlier you get to the gym the better seat you will 
get and a better time you will have. You know in your heart that 
C-MU is better than Pitt so come to the gym and assert yourself by 
upporting the Tartan team.
Gene-The-Machine Turner scores two points on another uncon
tested layup. Gene is leading the Tartans with 20.6 points per game.

FIRST COLLEGE HOCKEY 
GAME EVER IN PGH.
The first college hockey game 
to be played in Pittsburgh this 
season will have Carnegie-Mellon 
University facing off against 
West Virginia University at the 
Alpine Ice Arena on Sunday, 
Feb. 21 at 7 p.m.
The C-MU-WVU club hockey 
game is the first of a series ex
pected to be presented at the Al
pine during the next two months.
A lot of schools have been 
working on their club hockey 
programs for along time, said 
C-MU student Coach Russ Wescoe. Indiana, St. Vincent and St. 
Francis are just a few of the 
other schools weve contacted 
and hope to play here shortly.
The idea of course is to get a 
club hockey league started 
among the district colleges and 
we plan to hold a meeting of all 
interested schools toward the end 
of this month.
From that well start the new 
league and we should be playing 
college hockey games regularly 
the area next season. Weve 
playing games from tie to 
time in Western Pennsylvania 
this, of course, will be the 
in the City of Pittsburgh 
this season.
Norman Hoffman, manager of 
Alpine, is highly enthusiastic 
about the move to develop coll
ege hockey in the area.
For the last several seasons 
many of our local people have 
worked hard to develop hockey at 
the younger levels, said Hoff
man. Now we have the squirts,! 
the midgets and the bantams and 
all the rest and the little fellows 
are coming on strong.
Now its time for hockey en
thusiasts to start backing the 
sport at the high school and col
lege levels.
Admission for the CMU-WVU 
game is $1.00 for adults and 50 
cents for students. Proceeds will 
go to the club hockey programs.
The C-MU hockey team is car
rying a 3-2 record, owning vic
tories over St. Vincent (5-2), St. 
Francis (14-4) and Indiana (7-3).
Its two defeats have come 
against the Pitt-Johnstown (0-15) 
and West Virginia (3-8). The de
feat by the Mountaineers came 
at Wheeling but Wescoe feels

The injury ridden C-MU wrest
ling team lost a double meet 
Saturday, to St. Vincent 39-3 and 
to W & J 36-5. The Tartans start
ed off each meet down 15 points. 
Tom Diller at 142 separated his 
shoulder the day before the 
match. Renzo Venturo at 177 is 
out with injured knee liga
ments, and Dave Lurie at hwt. 
fractured his nose during prac
tice.
Not really hoping to overcome 
such large deficits, the C-MU 
wrestlers went out with the idea 
to improve individual perform
ances. In the St. Vincent meet, 
George Wargo (118) started out 
well with a nice double by take
down, but got caught on his back 
early in the second period. 
Clyde continued his winning 
ways at 190 by defeating his op
ponent 5-0. Clyde had a takedown, 
an escape, and riding time as he 
dominated the match. Other de
cisions lost by C-MU were Kahan 
(134) 9-7, Mors (150) 6-0, and 
much improved Vic Rogers (158) 
11-2, he lost after an outstanding 
first period.
Versus W & J. Wargo (118) lost 
a close match 2-0. Monte Ishige 
at 126 won 6-0. Wrestling well, 
Monte executed a quick duckunder for a takedown, and lat
er convinced a sit-out with a 
switch for a reversal. Clyde 
held his own again as he drew 
1-1. Other decisions lost by 
C-MU were Kohan 7-2, and Moss 
17-0. Overall, C-MU showed 
better moves than previously, 
and at times their chain-wrest
ling, i.e. one continuous move 
after another, was more affec
tive in setting up reversals. C-MU 
wrestles Grove City is Friday, 
February 19 in the gymnasium 
at 7:30 P.M. Come on out and 
cheer them on to their first vic
tory. This is the last home match 
of the season.

The Dean of the College of 
Humanities and Social Sciences 
announced Monday that the Uni
versity Budget Committee has 
appropriated $100,000, stating 
that the infant college must 
grow strong and needs to be well 
fed.
It is expected that one of the 
chief areas of appropriation 
within the college will be the ex
pansion of the declining Modern 
Language Department. The of
ficial title of the department 
will be changed to: Department 
of Modern, Ancient and Medie
val Languages. Proposed addi
tions to the department above the 
standy-bys (French, German, 
Spanish, Ittalian, Russian) are 
Old High German, Old High 
French, Old High English, Sen
ior High English, Swedish, 
Chinese literature Japanese 
poetry, Latin Hymns, Fortran, 
Swahili, Armenian and Algol.
Appropriations to the His
tory department are expected to 
go for courses being widely de
manded in Czechoslavakian 
history. A small minority group 
pressing for a course in the his
tory of Angorra is expected to 
be finally satisfied. If enough 
student interest is shown, a 
course entitled History of Chi
cle Harvesting will be added 
to the curriculum. Interdepart
mental courses will also ac
count for a large amount of the 
appropriations. Nutrition will 
co-operate with the history de
partment to produce a course in 
Historical Perspectives on the 
Development of Slavic Cooking.
The Psychology Department 
will use its funds to finance 
more campus research programs 
to analyze and at last determine 
the answer to the trying question, 
What causes an individual to 
come to C-MU.
Three Student Faculty Com
mittees will be formed under the 
auspices of the S.F.C.F.S.O.S.F.
F.C.A.A. (Student - FacultyCommittee For Study Of StudentDear Editor:
It has been said that in 
Cleveland honest men are as 
common as coconuts. I must 
concur rapaciously, in spite 
of your outrageous editorial 
stance. My reasons follow:
1. Dadaistic moralism has 
eliminated the ephemeral 
intangibility of Western sur
realism, here and in Johns
town.
2. As the wise, perhaps 
trite, but undoubtably true 
aphorism says: An un-black, 
non-dog could not cross a 
not so wide street unless he 
were not (I repeat, not) go
ing to an un-green pasture.
3. Wisdom cries out on the 
walls of toilet stalls and no 
man listens.
4. All buns served in the 
Tartan grill should be heat
ed, unless otherwise request
ed.
All due respect, 
Dr. Gaymont

The Chairman of Carnegie-Mellon Universitys Board of TrusI tees announced this morning that the school has received a grant of 
I 1.2 billion dollars from the Andrew Mellon Educational Trust 
I Foundation.
Announcing the gift at a ceremony held on the 6th floor of War-I
ner Hall, Board Chairman Aiken W. Fisher, noticeably elated, de
scribed the grant as the largest single gift ever presented to an 
jj, educational institution.
The Mellon Foundations generosity has established us as the 
| most heavily endowed university in the world, he said, and during 
the current economic recession, it seems only logical for CarnegieMellon to undertake a development and expansion program of mam
moth proportions.
Evidently, Administration officials knew about this phenomenal 
grant long before it was made public this morning. After Chairman 
Fishers announcement, Vice-President for Development John G. 
Johnson presented the Universitys plans to use the money  notably,
. the construction of three new buildings, a monument, and a tuition
* rebate for all full-time students.CONSTRUCTION!
Most remarkable of the plans presented was the plan for a sixstory underground parking facility to be built beneath the cut. With 
entrances on Forbes Avenue and walkways into Skibo, the new fa
cility will also be accessable through a tunnel running underneath 
the cut from Frew Street, in back of the Hunt Library.
Offering free parking to all members of the campus community, 
the garage will accommodate over 1500 automobiles. The cost is es
timated to run near $8 million dollars.
Johnson pointed out thatthe construction will at no time af
fect the surface of the cut, and should be completed in the spring 
of 1973.
ARTS COMPLEX
On the site of the present Morwood Gardens parking lot, John
son announced, the school will build a $12.95 Fine Arts Complex. 
However,he added, should the school decide to include curtains the 
cost will run over $14.00.
Outside the Complex, the University plans to build a monu(Iment to the memory of the late Capt. Henry Hornbostle, the arcitect who designed the original C-MU campus the first head of the 
department of architecture. $15 million has been allocated for the 
monument, and the preliminary design is that of the worlds largest 
yellow brick.
LUXURY DORMS
Demolition of all present dormitories (with the exception of 
Morewood and Mudge) is planned, and they are to be replaced by 
a single 23 story building which Johnson describes as Hiltonic. The 
new super-dorm will include squash courts, a solarium, a sauna, 
j'*n indoor track, a black-tie dining room, four newspaper offices for 
anyone who feels like putting out their own newspaper, and an 
aviary.
All the living units will be three room suites with balconies 
covered with ivy, giving the building the appearance of a hang
ing garden. Construction will begin tomorrow, and everyone living 
in the dorms to be demolished has twenty-four hours to find a place 
to live for the next two and a half years. Sleeping bags and tents 
will be provided by the Housing office at a rate of $3 per day.
Costof the new dorms is estimated at $100 million.
({H The old dorms will be recycled.
REBATES
Tuition rebates of $800 will be given to all full time students 
next Tuesday in the mens lavoratory on the second floor of Baker 
Hall. Students are advised to bring shopping bags, as the rebate 
will be in Canadian pennies.
A White House spokesman announced today that the Commanderin Chief has ordered the Seventh Fleet into Camh Rahn Bay to take 
on board the entire U. S. force in Indo - china. The spokesman 
termed the move, which had been under study and development 
secretly for months, bold in its simplicity.

Reaction around the world var
ied. Red China threatened to 
withdraw its troops from Tibet. 
Japan announced the opening of 
trade negotiations with North 
Vietnam and whomever they 
could find to deal with in Laos 
and Cambodia. Sam Nevergive-up March, head of the 
New Improved Mobe IV, was 
quoted as saying, Oh, Wow! 
Nationalist China, Thailand, and 
the Phillipines denounced the 
move, saying it would cost them 
millions. The Paris negotiatiors 
adjourned their 1,063rd ses
sion and got drunk at' the Cafe 
de la Paix on bourbon and rice 
wine. President Thieu and V.P. 
Ky were unavailable for com
ment at their respective Swiss 
villas.
Secretary of Defense and In
ternal Security, Melvin Mitchell 
said the pull back was made ne
cessary by the mob actions 
in the last week in Boston and 
San Francisco, where the return
ing troops are to be deployed. 
Groups termed subversive anarcho-dopefiends by the administration seized armories in these 
two cities recently and were 
joined by the local National 
Guard and Air Force Reserve 
units. No news has been receiv
ed from these areas since. In 
attempting to clarify the situa
tion, Mitchel likened the proba
bilities to a row of dominoes, 
saying, If we allow these ele
ments to succeed here, it will 
be New York and Los Angeles 
next, and then, who knows, 
even Appleton, Wisconsin and 
Kilgore, Texas, may fall pray to 
those un-American hordes. We 
have to interdict the spread with

which will study complaints by 
both students and faculty and 
serve as a forum for creative 
and imaginative discussion. $300 
will be appropriated for tea and 
cookies.
Zinnias will be planted by the 
entrances of Baker and Margar
et Morrison, to commemorate the 
miracle. It is hoped that the 
increase in appropriations will 
become an annual affair. College 
officials are delighted that the 
administration has finally decid
ed to encourage the growth of 
the new college. They believe 
that the recent increase will 
help them achieve the worth
while goals set down at the 
founding of the new college in 
Paul Mellons commencement 
speech of 1967.
