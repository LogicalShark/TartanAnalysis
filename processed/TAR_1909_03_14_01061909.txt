VOL. -Ill, No. 14artan
PITTSBURG, PA., WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 6, 1909CENTSTEN
DR. PRITCHETT HERE
Dr. Pritchett, the former president of the Massa
chusetts Institute of Technology, now head of the 
Carnegie Commission for the Advancement of Teach
ers, arrived at the Schools Tuesday evening. Ad
dressing several of the night classes then, he post
poned his trip through the schools until the next day. 
The following address was made in the Assembly 
Hall to the day students:
It is a part of my duty, as your Director has just 
said, to see a great deal of the student groups in 
various colleges, not only in the United States, but 
in the nighboring country of Canada.
I have had a rather peculiar change of interests 
within recent years, on account of going from a sin
gle institution, the Massachusetts Institute of Tech
nology, to a relationship in which I deal with all 
colleges and with all technical schools in the United 
States and Canada. It is a large change for a man; 
it is somewhat like going out from your family to 
college; you are transferring your affections and 
relations from your own family group to all of the 
family groups scattered from the St. Lawrence 
River to the Rio Grande.
One of the things which has struck me in my ex
perience is that the different student groups are 
much more alike throughout the United States than 
one commonly supposes. In Canada also you look 
into groups of faces with very much of the same 
characteristics as in this country.
A month ago I started to visit a number of colleges.  
I stopped in Philadelphia, and the President, taking 
me to one side said: You will understand our stu
dent type is very different from that which you find 
in Massachusetts and New York; they are earnest 
fellows, they do not come to college to have a good 
time, they are really true workers. ,
Then when I went to a university in Ohio, the 
President there also prefaced my visit by saying, 
You will not meet the kind of student here you meet 
in Philadelphia and New York, they are thorough 
workers, they do not come to college to play foot
ball or flirt with the girls; they are here to work.
Later I was at an Iowa university. The President 
who was much more serious than the others, was 
intent on emphasizing the sort of student material 
he had. He said: You understand you don't see the 
kind of students here you meet in Ohio; they are 
not frivolous, they are earnest and different from 
those at the other colleges.
The fact is, they are a just about the same, they 
are in good earnest, pleasure-loving, energetic, Am
erican boys. There is but very little difference be
tween the student group in one place and the student 
group in another. We are all members of the com
mon country, for which we have reason to be thank
ful. We are all members of a country which has as
sumed important relations for each individual citizen 
of that country, for which we also have reason to be 
thankful.
As I have looked, seen and addressed these various 
student groups, I have wondered how great was 
their patriotism, how much they talked about poli
tics, how much they interested themselves in their 
countrys welfare. About a year and a half ago I 
was with some students in an English university, 
and was very much interested to hear them discuss 
the political situation of the day, about affairs in In
dia and South Africa, about the tariff, and about 
the problems everywhere that confront the British 
Empire. When I came back I happened shortly to 
be with a group of Harvard undergraduates, and I 
noticed that their main topic of conversation was

4THE TARTAN
athletics. I wondered if this was the real attitude 
of American students as compared to English stu
dents, or whether it was merely an accidental thing 
that 1 had observed. I am inclined to think that the 
men here are a little disposed to elevate their col
lege patriotism to the harm of their national patriot
ism.
So I suggest this morning that you go into politics. 
Over in New York we have a very depressing kind 
of politics, no doubt in Pittsburgh everything is pure 
(laughter). I cannot understand why you should 
laugh, but whatever it is, there is no duty of Ameri
can citizens so close as the duty to have politics de
cent and right. One thing is certain, that if the 
greater part of the citizens do not rule this country, 
its destiny is in peril. 1 think that sometimes we 
lose sight of this, and sometimes our college pa
triotism in crowding out national patriotism, is not 
what it should be. We have college yells and college 
songs and college loyalty which is all very fine, but 
I think we should have more national patriotism. 
Every American citizen should know something 
about his state and have an intelligent interest in it.
Another duty -which the best type of a citizen has 
is not only his duty to himself but he should be 
sufficiently strong to do something for his neighbor, 
his fellow-citizen. The future of this great land must, 
after all, rest on a national unselfishness; it is not 
enough to pull yourself up; you should pull up some 
other fellow. If you do this, we, as a nation, are 
not going to get to that exalted place on the roster 
of the worlds powers that we ought to reach, and 
that we are capable of reaching.
To close, I am going to give you an account of a 
legend which I once heard in a little village near Mos
cow. The Russians are a 'people which are as for
eign from Americans as one can well imagine. The 
great mass of Russians are peasants. They are fast
ened to the soil. A peasant cannot cannot go more 
than twenty versts from home without a passport 
from the police, and he finds it difficult to get that. 
They are practically chained to the land. In the 
neighborhood in which they live there are practical
ly no schools, yet they have a singular devotion to 
their country. They pass around the lessons of their 
patriotic devotion, the lessons of their own unselfish
ness, by an interesting series of stories which they 
hand down from one generation to the other. The 
father relates them to his son in exactly the same 
manner in which he received it from his father. 
This folk-lore is practically the only thing in Russia 
which perpetuates ] atrictism, which helps to pull 
up. The legend in this village, which helps to illus
trate the fact that we all have a common interest, 
is this:
There was once a poor woman who died, whose 
record on earth had not been particularly good in 
the matter of generosity. She went to that burning 
place of which we have all heard, and while she lay 
in this realm of fire, an angel flew across. She 
reached up and called, saying she was a poor peasant 
with no one to help her. She said I did not live a
bad life; I never did any harm in the other world; 
it is not just that I should be sent here. You go up 
and present this injustice to the Lord.
The angel agreed to present the story. The Lord, 
on hearing it, said to go back and ask the woman 
if she ever helped another human being while on 
earth. So the angel went back and asked her. She 
thought a long time and finally, by much effort, re
membered that she had once given a blind beggar 
a carrot. The Lord, on being told this, sent the angel 
back, with instructions to pull her out of the fire 
with the carrot.
And out she came, first with the shoulders, then 
her body, then her feet, until she was quite clear. 
But to her great astonishment and anger she found 
another pesron hanging onto her feet and another 
onto the feet of that person and still others, until 
ten i)oor souls were being rescued with the help of 
that one carrot. When she discovered this she was 
alarmed. She was afraid they would loosen her grip 
on the carrot, so she began to kick her feet about and 
to cry Let go, let go, this is my carrot. And im
mediately the carrot broke, and they all fell back 
into the pit of flame.
Let me suggest that you do not allow the carrot 
to break on you. (Applause.)
GUNBOAT SPEEDS THROUGH SHALLOW 
WATER.
A twin-screw war vessel, the gunboat Widgeon, 
constructed by the British navy, has a draught of 
only five feet five inches. Its hull is built in floating 
sections, arranged in such a manner that they can 
be easily united while afloat, thus avoiding the 
necessity of riveting together and launching in for
eign regions where skilled labor may not be ob
tainable.
It was designed to obtain the highest efficiency in 
regard to speed and propulsive effort under various 
conditions of load. Normally its speed is fifteen 
miles an hour.
There are twin screws placed in tunnels aft, these 
tunnels consisting of inverted troughs raised in the 
skin plating of the hinder part of the hull, the floor 
of the latter being very flat in order to secure the 
shallow draught. The crown of the tunnel is con
siderably higher than the water level, and as the 
propeller blades in revolving come within mere clear
ance distance of the top of the tunnel it will be evi
dent that a considerable part of the propeller is also 
above the water level. The tunnel, however, dips 
below the surface all around, that is, its edges are 
under water. When the screws are caused to re
volve they drive the air out of the tunnels, and the 
water, rising to fill the vacuum thus created, causes 
the screws to be fully immersed.
The Widgeon is 160 feet long and 24 feet G inches 
wide. The depth of hull is six feet.

Le roi est mort; vive le roi. The old officers have 
gone with the old year, but we shall always remember 
their excellent administration.
Mr. Helm, at the helm, whcfhas 30 ably conducted 
our assemblies, and Mr. Keagy, his assistant, whose 
services, though not much in evidence, have been 
influential in shaping the destiny of the class, de
serve the thanks and appreciation of every member.
Our excellent Sample, who so nobly conducted the 
feast of reason and flow of soul, and his efficient 
successor, Mr. Jay Rothschilds Newmann, are worthy 
of the highest praise for their literary activities.
We are thankful that Joe McCreery has not devel
oped any trust busting proclivities.
To the athletic committee, under the direction of 
Mr. McCowen, is due the high standing of this class 
in school athletics. The social committee, Mr. R. 
Griffiths, chairman, is to be credited for the enjoy
able hours it has provided; and the auditing com
mittee, Mr. Cole, chairman, not ornamental but neces
sary, has carried out its work in a praiseworthy 
manner.
Mr. Hoffmans notes in these columns have always 
been good reading, and bear witness to his excellent 
sense of humor.
We desire to convey to Mr. Aude, our class ad
visor, our appreciation of his counsel and guidance 
throughout the school year.
It is rumored that that well-known individual 
Jerome Aloysius Ignatius Lonergan, alias "The Fash-' 
ion Plate, has been practicing law at Room 113. 
We hope he wins his first case.
The editor wishes to advise the spendthrifts and 
those of a profligate turn of mind to take care of 
their pennies so that they may be able to meet the 
demands of the social committee in February.
It has come to the ears of the  editor that 
our honorable president, Bill Bailey McCreery, 
came home w;th fear and trembling on the night of 
December 18th. But his wife reassured him by say
ing, I know those Maggie Murphy girls are harmless 
if taken in small doses.
But dont get the habit, Mac.
The editor had a very delightful shopping trip with 
Little Eddie Weber a few nights before Christmas. 
It is surprising how popular Eddie is, especially with 
the maidens. Such is the fate of the foot ball player.

GLEE AND MANDOLIN CLUB NEWS,
On Saturday, December 19th, the Glee and Mando
lin Clubs played and sang at the Pittsburg Country 
Club, Beechwood Boulevard. The occasion was the 
annual meeting of the Country Club members, in con
nection with which Director Hamerschlag gave an ad
dress. During the time the fellows were not doing 
their stunts, the club rooms, bowling alleys, etc., 
were at their disposal, and mirth and good feeling 
reigned supreme. A buffet luncheon was served in 
the smoking room, which added the right touch to a 
jolly evening. Transportation between club house 
and car line was provided in automobiles.
The flash light pictures taken in the main club 
room were a pronounced success, the handsome man
tel and walls making a unique and decorative back
ground. Proofs may be seen and pictures ordered 
(one dollar each, mounted) from L. Koethen, mana
ger.
A number of members of the two clubs were the 
guests of the Yale Alumnae Association at the Yale 
Glee and Mandolin Clubs Concert, Friday, December 
18th. The work of the Yale men is truly fine and our 
fellows were enabled to realize more fully the great 
possibilities of such work. A pleasant feature was 
the exchange of cheers after the concert by Tech 
and Yale men.
At the request of our basket-ball manager, the 
date for the big annual concert at Carnegie Music 
Hall has been changed to Friday, February 19th. 
This is the only Friday on which the Music Hall could 
be secured and is an especially fine date for a musical 
entertainment.
In addition to the local annual concert, a number 
of other dates are in view outside of Pittsburg, 
dependent, however, upon the relief of a financial 
stringency which provides a serious handicap. The 
management is working on a number of plans to be 
discussed more fully at a joint Business Meeting 
to be held next Sunday. Every member should attend 
this meeting. The engagements in view, and which 
are perfectly possible if the club can borrow a little 
money in advance, areTarentum, Uniontown, Jean
ette, Greensburg, Youngstown, Akron, Canton, and 
New Castle.

M. M. C. S.
Happy New Year to all! Glad to see you back. 
Hope you all had a happy restful time, and are 
ready for work again.
The term end dances are more pleasant each time, 
the one on December 18th being especially so.
All of the classes were represented, and the girls 
were glad to see that the men seemed to have a 
better time than usual.
The programs prepared by the boys were decidedly 
clever and amusing and served to break the ice 
and create a laugh.
On Tuesday, December eighth, the upper night 
classes of the Margaret Morrison Carnegie School 
entertained the Night Plebe class in the faculty 
rooms of the school. There were games and dancing 
and an altogether enjoyable evening was spent by a 
greater number of the members of the three classes. 
We were delighted to have with us Director and Mrs. 
Hamerschlag and a number of members of our facul
ty who entered into the fun and were school kids 
with us again. Buffet refreshments were served in 
the hall and proved very popular. The evening was 
closed by the singing of school songs.
MINCE PIES.
563-L, please.
Hello, is this Miller'sMillers groceiy?
Please send to Mrs. X, 100 Lake street,
2 bunches of celery,
3 lbs. mixed nuts,
2 qts. cranberries,
1 pt. olives,
1 package seeded raisins.
That is all, I guess.
What is it? Oh! Are they fresh?
How much a pound?
Well, you might add a couple of pounds to my 
order. Good-bye.
Well, that is off my mind. Now, what next? Oh, 
yes! Those mince pies! Wont they be good? 
With these words little Mrs. X. started for her 
spic and span kitchen. She had been married but 
two months and she and Mr. X. had decided to spend 
this their first Christmas alone in their own cozy 
cottage. Consequently she was preparing excitedly 
for the next days big dinner.
She had fixed the mince meat for her pies and 
sifted the flour when suddenly the sound of the doorbc II j ealed through the house. With a couple of 
floury pats to her hair, she hurried to the door and 
received a whole armful of letters and packages 
from the postman. There was a long letter from 
Mother, a couple of others, and some packages to
be inspected. Oh, my! the dearest little apronand 
the prettiest work-bagand all sorts of things!
Ten oclock and those pies not even in the oven! 
But soon two were baking and a little third one 
(made from the scraps) was patiently waiting its 
turn.
While these were baking, this ambitious little 
housewife arranged her wreaths and holly boughs, 
and even mistletoe in unsuspicious corners, almost 
forgetting her precious pies. They were rescued 
just in time, and the little third pie slid into the oven. 
Now this little pie had secretly resolved to bake ex
tra well because it had been kept waiting so long, 
for it felt that it was really just as nice even if it had 
been made out of leavings.
As soon as the pies had been put in the open
window to cool, the favorite relishes and jellies 
could be brought up from the cellar. As Mr. X. 
would be home all day to-morrow everything possible 
must be done to-day. When Mrs. X. descended into 
her cellar she found the usually neat, straight rows 
of fruit and preserves_in sad disorder. Ah! yes, she 
knew! 'Twas the result of Mr. X.s attempt to
help one night not long ago! The jars and cans 
wrere quickly put in order, while the little woman 
smiled to herself in recollection.
Halfway up the stairs she was greeted with a 
strangely familiar odor. Rushing to the stove and 
opening the oven door, she encountered a puff of 
smoke and a sorry little black pie. How provoking! 
But then she had two others, so there was no need 
to fret. John and she would be alone and could not 
possibly eat more than one.
Standing by the window musing over the pies, she 
was startled by a door opening behind her. She turn
ed quicklyto face her mother, father and three 
small brothers! As she started in surprise, she
came too near the window and one of the two
precious pies was tipped out, upside down on the 
wet, dirty grass! And all these extra people to feed!
Oh, dear, what shall I do? she wailed.

WHITE FRIARS ANNOUNCEMENT.
The White Friars, the dramatic club of the 
Schools, announce their play for the coming year 
to be The Title Trailers. This play has been 
written expressly for the club by Mr. Walter B. 
Edmundson, last years coach.
The trials of the cast and the chorus will be held 
Wednesday, January 13th, in the Assembly Hall, at 
8 o'clock, and all men wishing to try for the show, 
must come out at that time. For full information 
as to details, and in order to keep posted on what 
the club is doing, consult the bulletin boards on the 
first floor.
The initial effort of the club last year met with 
so much success that they feel that with the experi
ence of a season behind them, and the thorough 
support of the student body, this years play will 
be a great success.
Between one hundred and one hundred and fifty 
men have signified their intention of coming out to 
the trials, and we believe that on account of so much 
popular interest having been aroused, the preceding 
notice will be of unusual interest. It is a good in
dication, but it is not surprising as dramatics of the 
kind indulged in here reach more of the student 
body, both day and night, than any other student 
activity.
Mr. Edmundson will coach the show again this 
year, and the past alone is sufficient to assure a 
square deal. The following remark made by Mr. 
Edmundson will show how he selects his men, for, 
speaking to one of the men in the cast of last years 
production he said, You can try for whatever you 
like, but youve got to show me that you are better 
than the other felloW.
The Board of Governors of the Club will meet 
at 7.30 oclock, January 13th.
1913.
The men of 12 have, very kindly, taken upon 
themselves the office of Guide, Philosopher, and 
Friend, to 13; and we appreciate it, although, after 
a cursory examination of the 12 class, we are rather 
at a loss to understand why they do it. We are 
grateful, however, and can, perhaps, from time to 
time, offer to our friends suggestions timely and 
helpful. As, we would suggest that 12 train an 
Auxiliary Foot Ball squad next fall, of sufficient num
ber to form a double line through the crowd of 
spectators, between the sides of which the runner 
may pass. With this additional interference 12 
ought to eat us by two points, anyway.
It appears to be the custom of some of the fellows 
to get into their lockers with a jimmy instead of 
using a key; and occasionally they break into the 
wrong one and wholly by accident, carry away ma
terials for which they have not paid. Uncharitable 
persons have called these fellows by hard names, 
interspersed with peculiar adjectives; in view of

WINTER TERM OPENS.
Monday was something in the way of a grand 
handshaking and general reception day for every
one. Tuesday might have been termed a day set 
aside for the exploring of the new building by those 
trying to And their class rooms or laboratories. All 
day long crowds were running up stairs and down, 
dodging plasterers and electric wiremen, only to 
arrive at the proper place in time to meet the one 
or two of his class, who had been fortunate enough 
to locate the proper place, coming out to begin the 
search for the next. The worst example of confu
sion that has come to our ears is that of one unfor
tunate who arived at the right place place at what he 
thought the right time, to have the professor calmly 
tell him he was in the right class, but just exactly 
one day late.
The Electric Lab. is not hard to find. By standing 
in the main corridor of the proper floor and listening 
carefully, it is possible to hear the mighty chorus of 
the unfortunate Electricals saying peculiar sounding 
things about cement floors and expansion bolts.
In the new region occupied by the Metalurgists, 
the scribe lingered only long enough to hear a bass 
voice say, "Theahh carBON andahh the siliCON 
, and concluded that the department was running 
smoothly and did not need to be investigated. The 
Civil department was entirely deserted, but bore 
evidence of things doing.
THE PENN BASKET-BALL GAME.
Did you see that Penn game? If not, you missed 
a game that will go down in the history of athletics 
at Carnegie Tech as one of the best ever. Fellows, 
keep awake to the fact that Tech has a basket-ball 
team of which every student may feel proud but 
they need the support of every man in school. The 
new men are showing up wellBrown, Dolan and 
Williams have demonstrated that they are,working 
for Tech all the time. Agnew, Buhl and Harrison 
were never in better condition, while Captain Leety 
is playing even better ball than last year and we 
know what happened in the games with U. of P.
In Dr. Schaeffer we have a coach who knows the 
game and is one of the best in this section of the 
country. Together with the help of Mr. Lightner 
and Mr. Ewing, the team is rapidly developing good 
team work.
We have an intercollegiate series to be played this 
year with Geneva, Westminister, Allegheny and 
Grove City for the championship of Western Penn
sylvania. Every man in school wants to see his team 
win and can help by giving a little spare time to 
basket-ball. College life is not a grind and those 
who make it such, are missing a part of the course 
which is as essential as the class-room work. Get 
out with the fellows and prove that you want to help 
Tech at every advantage given.
Tech has an athletic reputation to develop and 
can never advance if the rooting is continued in the 
manner it was done last Wednesday evening. Why 
must a few of us hiss whenever the opposing team is 
penalized? Hissing is never heard on Franklin 
Field and should never be heard at any of our ath
letic events, so let us get together and put a stop 
to it.
The first of the intercollegiate series will be played 
this Thursday at Duquesne Gardens with Geneva 
and it is up to every man to at least come singly 
and root with the rest of us; if double, root anyhow. 
Tickets are on sale at the store-room.

entitled The Sophomore:
O'er the campus wide he roams,
Monument of knowledge!
Marked by the towering hat he wears 
And the gigantic oaths he swears,
And his buccaneering airs;
Despot of the college.
Freshmen hear his withering chaff 
With dejection.
At his barbarous jokes they laugh,
Else, around, his fiendish wrath 
Brings, like old Clearchus staff,
Quick subjection.
Freshmen verdancy he hails 
With derision;
And absolved from studious cares,
Apes of Juniors cultured airs,
Smooths his scattering mustache hairs 
With precision.
Freshmen hear his learned words 
With sedateness.
And with goal full in their sight,
Labor upward throughout the night 
Toward the vast Olympic height 
Of his greatness.

W. H. King was awarded a mention on his one day 
sketch for a Garage.
The students in the Class B Plan division rendered 
thirteen problems on December 26th, the subject 
was A Villa and Garden. At the same time the stu
dents in the Order division rendered fifty-eight de
signs, the subject being The Treatment of an Aque
duct. Both these problems will be judged on the 
evening of January 7th.
Messrs. King and Rigaumont rendered a one day 
sketch on January 2d. The subject was A Recrea
tion Park. On January 2 and 4 students in the Class 
B division made the preliminary sketches for Plan 
and Order Problems. These problems will be ren
dered February 13th. The subject of the Plan prob
lem was An Amphitheater for Clinics. Subject of the 
Order problem was A Monumental Rostral Column in 
the Corinthian Order.
A cablegram has been received from Mr. A. W. 
Sparks, who was recently offered a position in the 
School of Applied Design as Instructor in freehand 
drawing, stating that he would accept the position 
and would sail on the St. Paul from Liverpool on 
January 9th. It is expected that he will arrive at 
the Schools to take up his work about the last of this 
month. Mr. Sparks is a young American who began

MONSTER DREDGE FOR LIVERPOOL HARBOR.
The entrance to the harbor at Liverpool, England, 
has been a problem for engineers since it is neces
sary to maintain a depth ranging from 35 feet to 40 
feet of water in order to accommodate the ocean 
steamships which enter. A deposit of shifting sand 
makes it imperative to utilize large dredges to main
tain the ship channel at this point. The Liverpool 
harbor board has decided to construct a dredge for 
this service which is by far the largest ever utilized 
for a similar purpose. It will be placed in operation 
within the next year. The dredge is what is known 
as a sea-going dredge, and is large enough to load the 
sand and other material, which it removes, into its 
own hoppers, thence going to sea and discharging 
the detritus at a point where it will not shoal the 
ship channel.
The sand and mud are removed by huge suction 
pipes which extend from the side of the vessel to the 
bottom. Each pipe is equipped with several suction 
heads as they are called, through which the ma
terial is drawn into the tubes, the air being exhaust
ed by powerful centrifugal pumps. It is carried 
into the dredge in a liquid state but separated from 
the water before being placed in the receiving tanks. 
The dredge then proceeds to sea to discharge cargo, 
returning to the dredging ground under its own 
steam. An idea of the power and capacity of the 
dredge can be obtained when it is stated that it will 
excavate and remove fully 50,000 cubic yards of ma
terial in a working day of twelve hours or nearly 
5,000 cubic yards an hour. This more than doubles 
the capacity of the largest dredge in use on the 
Panama project or of any one of the mud machines 
now employed in deepening New York harbor and 
the channel leading thereto.

Mr. F. I. Gaston is in the Allegheny General Hos
pital recovering from a slight operation, and expects 
to be back to the schools by the first of the week.

"JA "rN"rU11
TO COMBINE FACTORY AND SCHOOLROOM.
Advanced ground in industrial educational work 
has been taken in Fitchburg, Mass. Educators in all 
parts of the country are watching the development 
of the ambitious undertaking with more than passing 
interest, as upon the success or failure of the depart
ure will depend whether or not the plan is adopted 
elsewhere. This fall the second-year high school 
boys received the privilege of learning a metal trade 
by going into the factories of the town to work one 
week at regular factory hours and to return to the 
.schoolroom the following week, thus alternating 
between factory and schoolroom throughout the year. 
Twenty boys were elected to take the new course, 
and the reports for the first three months of the 
experiment are altogether favorable, not one of the 
twenty boys having shown any desire to abandon 
the combination of schoolroom and factory work.
It is the first attempt of the kind in a public school. 
A course similar to this one has been in operation at 
the University of Cincinnati for older boys, and the 
Fitchburg experiment is patterned after the Cincin
nati idea. The course is one of four years, the first 
year consists exclusively of schoolroom work and the 
three following years of theoretical and practical 
training equally apportioned. The factory owners, 
seven of whom are co-operating with the school de
partment, say that the high school boys are makingbetter progress than the full-time apprentices, and 
Superintendent Joseph G. Edgerly, of the Fitchburg 
public' schools, reports that the schoolroom work of 
these boys is fully up to the standard.
The success of the Fitchburg plan seems so well 
assured that steps are being taken in a number of 
other cities, whose school authorities have been in 
correspondence with Superintendent Edgerly, to be
gin similar courses next year. Superintendent Ed
gerly and Principal John G. Thompson, of the Massa
chusetts State Normal School, at Fitchburg, who 
has taken a deep interest in the working out of the 
plan, believe they have gone a long way toward solv
ing the problem of how best to keep the boys in the 
high school for the full four years course, a problem 
that has been the despair of educators in all manu
facturing towns, such as is Fitchburg. The belief 
of many parents, whether right or wrong, that their 
boys, who must eventually find their way into the 
shops, were wasting time in school when they could 
be learning a trade has been as much the cause of the 
falling off in the enrollment of second and third year 
high school classes as the youthful longing to break 
into lifes real battle and to throw school books aside.
Solve Expense Problem.
Inability of parents to support their boys during 
the four years they were in the high school has also 
unquestionably been a big factor, but this has been 
eliminated in Fitchburg, as the boys who take the 
shop work course will be able to earn enough to 
clothe themselves, and even pay board, without inter
ference with their school work, since they receive 
regular apprentice wages for the actual time they

We are the Makers of the Carnegie Tech School Pins
work in the factories. The first year they receive
10 cents an hour, and they work approximately 1,650 
hours. Working the same number of hours the two 
following years, they receive 11 and IIV2 cents an 
hour, respectively, and they are as well fitted for 
their trade as if they had put in all their time in the 
factorybetter fitted, because of a livelier intelli
gence and ability to use their heads, as well as their 
hands, Superintendent Edgerly says.
The shopwork consists of instruction under prac
tical overseers in the operation of lathes, planers, 
drilling machines, bench and floor work and such 
other machine work, according to the ability of the 
apprentice, as pertains to the particular branch of 
manufacture of the shop where the boy is employed. 
Of the twenty boys who entered the Fitchburg shops 
last August, sixteen are learning the machinists 
trade, two are receiving practical instruction in 
pattern making and two in drafting. The co-opera
tive course includes English, mathematics, with ta
bles and simple shop problems; mechanics, includ
ing simple machines; freehand drawing, each five 
periods a week, and two periods for current events.
When the shop work is reached in the second year 
the schoolroom periods are arranged as follows: Four 
each for English, physics and mechanism of machines, 
five for shop mathematics and eight for freehand 
and mechanical drawing. In the third year four 
periods a week are still devoted to English and 
mechanism of machines and five periods to shop 
mathematics. Physics and chemistry have three per
iods, commercial geography and business methods 
have one period, and freehand and mechanical draw
ing continues to have eight periods. English still 
has four periods in the senior year; shop mathe
matics, mechanism of machines and freehand and me
chanical drawing have five periods each; electricity 
and heat have four periods, and civics and American 
history are allotted two periods a week, making what 
those who arranged the course consider a well round
ed mechanical education.
The manufacturers take the boys in pairs, so that 
by alternating they have at all times one of the pairs 
at work. Each Saturday at 11 oclock the boys who 
have been in the schoolroom that week go to the 
shop to ascertain what particular job their alternates
have been employed on and how it has been hand
led, so that the work may be taken up the following 
Monday morning without delay. In addition to the 
regular school work, an industrial society has been 
organized for mental and social advancement. The 
society meets each month and is conducted by the 
boys themselves. The plan is to have manufacturers 
and others give talks of an instructive nature, and 
follow up the talks with discussions by the members. 
Social gatherings also will be held from time to time, 
to which others than members will be invited.
The workers are entirely under the instruction of 
the foremen in the factories. Professor William B. 
Hunter, of the high school, visits the factories oc
casionally, but merely to see that the boys are con
ducting themselves properly and to keep in touch 
with them. Superintendent Edgerlys plan for the 
co-operative course was due to one of the manufact
urers of the town, who, hearing of the Cincinnati ex
periment, expressed a desire to see the plan adopted 
in Fitchburg. While Superintendent Edgerly worked 
with the school board this manufacturer brought 
the other factory managers into line. One of the 
strongest points in favor of a general adoption of the 
plan is its inexpensiveness. No appropriation what
ever is needed.New York Tribune.

THE CHEMICAL ENGINEER AND OUR 
NATIONAL FIRE LOSS.
By William M. Booth, M.S.
Chemical Engineer, Syracuse, N. Y.
United States Government reports for 190G show 
that property valued at $383,000,000 was destroyed 
by fire. This includes the loss due to the San 
Francisco disaster. The loss for 1907 was consider
ably in excess of $200,000,000. Considering the total 
annual wage of the average artisan at $1,000 it is 
not a difficult matter to determine the loss to human 
effort in the United States that may be attributed 
to fires annually. Comparison of these figures with 
those of older countries in Europe shows that their 
loss is but a fraction of our own. Insurance com
panies are awakening to the gravity of the situation 
and are studying the subject more closely than ever 
before.
Inquiry will show that fire protection as practiced 
by the majority is not based upon accurate knowledge 
and that only in the largest cities is a scientific 
study made of it. As fire, fighting often involves 
huge structures it becomes an engineering matter 
so that problems of this nature may very properly 
be investigated by the Chemical Engineer.
The phenomena of fire are and have always proved 
quite beyond the comprehension of the unscientific. 
Among scientists Lavoisier as early as 1760 had a 
better understanding of combustion than any who 
preceded him although men of deep intellect had 
spent years of their lives contemplating and experi
menting.
Whether man builds high into the air or whether 
he works at the surface of the earth; whether he 
sails aboard ships of the sea or delves in mines 
under the earth the possibilities of loss by fire are ever 
present, for to a large extent is man's supremacy 
due to the use of this agent.
From January 1st to November 15th, 1907, 3,551

Physics and chemistry have shown us that every 
combustible substance has its kindling point and 
that a certain amount of heat must first be applied 
to any material to raise its temperature from that 
of the surrounding medium to this kindling point 
before combustion will follow. In the case of a piece 
of iron weighing a ton and in the form of a sphere 
or cube it would be an enormous task to raise this 
to a temperature at which all of the metal would 
be reduced to oxide. On the other hand, if this 
same metal were machined to an extremely fine 
state of filings and thrown into a flame .combustion 
would immediately take place with explosive vio
lence. This is an extreme case but well illustrates 
how a difference in the mass of a combustible -mater
ial may represent a large difference in combusti
bility. The cube of steel is practically non-combusti
ble. The extremely small particle is very combusti
ble, and we can readily see why gas is so much more

rod of metal half an inch ,in diameter to the fusing 
point, [f this is in contact with inflammable ma
terial a fire may result. It is probable that severe 
forest fires have resulted from electric discharge 
throughout all time since forests have grown. Bal
loons above and all combustible material on the 
surface of the earth as well as the dust and gases 
of mines far under the surface are subject to the 
ravages of this peculiar agent.
Carelessness.
Matches in boxes are, I am told by dealers, a very 
safe fire risk. The air necessary for combustion is 
not present so that a fire started in a match box pro
duces gases which extinguish the fire itself. Stray 
parlor matches in the hands of careless people are 
undoubtedly the cause of many fires. These are 
thrown into waste material of any kind and a fire 
may result hundreds of miles away in a ball of rags 
containing the match. Smokers are often careless 
with the discarded match stick, throwing it into
waste baskets or on the floor. Equally serious is 
the discarded cigar or cigarette falling through 
through cracks in the floor o fwaiting rooms, stables 
and public buildings. While in charge of the pack
ing room of a chemical concern I found it necessary 
to remain at work during the evening. At one time 
the sink began to glow with a steady phosphorescent 
light. This proved to be due to a quantity of stick 
phosphorus that an employe had tried to throw away 
down the sink after an unsuccessful attempt to manu
facture phosphoric acid.
Recently a witness testified on the stand that he 
regularly removes fleas through the use of a mix
ture of phosphorus and gasoline, one pound of the 
former to one gallon of the latter. The man sued 
the owner of a flat house for $20,000 for personal 
injuries received while he was spraying a cellar floor 
with a gallon of this mixture. The janitor had placed 
a lighted lantern in one corner. When the liquid 
was sprayed against the lantern a fire resulted. A 
specific instance of the fires that may be engendered 
by naphtha may be mentioned. A woman poured 
one gallon of this material into her hair cloth furni
ture to destroy vermin. This caught fire from her 
kitchen stove and blew the entire side of the flat 
across the street. Another instance,Two boys had 
charge of a large city house. Their dogs had fleas, 
a barrel of gasoline was used to exterminate these 
from the rugs of the house and an explosion fol
lowed which burned the house to the ground.
