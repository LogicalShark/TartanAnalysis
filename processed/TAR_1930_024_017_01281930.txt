Hyatt and Nease Battle For 
Scoring Honors in 
City
Tuesday, January 21, the Carnegie 
liasketball squad made a trip to 
Beaver Falls where the Geneva 
cagers were successful in nosing 
them out 3S-35 after a bitterly con
tested game. George Nease again 
distinguished himself by scoring eight 
field goals and making good six of 
his throws from the foul line for a 
total of twenty-two points. The 
team as a whole showed a great im
provement in this department; loop
ing thirteen out of nineteen chances.
The game opened with several 
rough skirmishes after which Geneva 
held the lead by a slight margin. 
Nease and Webster then opened up 
their opponents defense with some 
pretty passing and scored three two 
pointers from underneath the basket. 
Their rivals were quick to retaliate, 
however, and caged a basket and a 
foul to regain the lead. From this 
point on the score see-sawed back 
and forth for the entire first period, 
at the end of which Geneva was on 
the big end of a 18-17 score. Cap
tainNease led a fighting band of 
Tartans on the floor in the second 
period, but the Beaveritcs refused 
to be outdone and managed to keep 
the scoring on even terms with the 
visitors. The Skibos tied the count 
early in the second frame, but thi 
best they could do was to hold their 
opponents to a tie, 33-33, when the 
whistle blew ending the second ses
sion. During the first extra period 
Nease looped a two pointer to place

R.O.T.C. Sponsors Chapel 
Exercises at Noon Today
The final chapel exercise for 
this semester will be held to
day in the Little Theater at 
12:30 o^clock.
The speaker that has been se
cured for the occasion is the 
Rev. Dr. Ralph W. Lloyd of the 
Edgcwood Presbyterian Church, 
lie is a man actively interested 
in colleges and in sports, and is 
an admirable speaker. Although 
he has never addressed our 
chapel before he is not a 
stranger on the campus as he 
has led discussion at Y. W. C. A. 
supper-'-'meetings.
Other events on the program 
include a cello solo by Lillian 
Ewing of the Music Department, 
and organ music by Mrs. Nina Miller.
This chapel is being spon
sored by the Reserve Officers 
Training Corps branch at Car
negie, and the student members 
of that organization will attend 
the exercises in a group.
Organization Of 
Freshmen Y.M.C.A. 
Cabinet Proposed
At a meeting of the Y. M. C. A, 
Cabinet Monday afternoon, January 
20, the . Cabinet voted to send two 
delegates to a conference to be held 
 by the Middle Atlantic' Field*. Council 
of Student Young Mens Christian 
Association at the Inn, Buck Hill 
Falls, Pennsylvania, on February 14, 
15 and 16. Alexander Orr, president 
of the Cabinet, was nominated to 
make the trip. No decision was 
reached as to whom the other mem
ber from the Cabinet would be. Mr. 
Davis, secretary of the Carnegie 
Tech Y. M. C. A., will also attend 
the conference. Again Mr. Davis 
asks for students to volunteer to 
attend. All those who think they 
would like to go to Buck Hill Falls 
are requested to get in touch with 
Air. Davis at' once. The Cabinet will 
attempt to raise enough funds to de
fray at least part of the expenses of 
the week-end trip. The total quota 
from Carnegie Tech has been set 
at six students and one faculty mem
ber.
It was decided at the meeting to 
organize a Freshman Cabinet. The 
purpose of. such a cabinet would be 
to create an interest among fresh
men for the Y. M. C. A., and to 
enable the freshmen to become fam
iliar with cabinet work. Thus the 
freshman, who at present does not 
participate in cabinet work, through 
the Freshman Cabinet may become 
acquainted with the "work and during 
his sophomore year he may take his 
place on the senior f cabinet without 
a period of orientation.
Tentative plans were made by the 
members for a large Y. M. C. A. 
dinner to be held sometime in Feb
ruary or March. As usual, the Cab
inet plans to make this annual affair 
another success, as they hope ot have 
a prominent speaker and several 
good entertainment numbers. The 
dinner will probably be held in the 
Commons. Anybody on the campus 
may attend the affair.
Several joint meetings with the 
Y. W. C. A. Cabinet were arranged. 
The purpose of these joint cabinet 
meetings is to create a better. co
operative spirit between the Y. W.
C. A. and the Y. M. C. A.
Before the meeting was closed, 
each member of the cabinet ap
pointed himself a committee of one 
to see that the newly remodeled Y. 
M. C. A. club room be kept in neat order.
Alpha Tau Holds 
Formal Initiation 
At Webster Hall
Wm, McNeil, Class 29, Acts 
As Toastmaster At 
Ceremony
Alpha Tau, the College of Indus
tries honorary fraternity, held its 
formal initiation on Wednesday even
ing, January 22, at Webster Hall 
Hotel. The initiates were John 
Iienry Gedeon, William Francis 
Henderson, Walter A. Jameson, Alex
ander Orr, and Charles William Pitkin. J
The initiation ceremonies took 
place in the Pilot House of Webster 
Hall and were followed by a ban
quet in one of the private dining 
rooms adjoining the Georgian room. 
The toastmasters duties were ably 
performed by William M. McNeill, 
Printing 29, who led off with some 
good stories and then proceeded to 
introduce the speaker of the evening, 
Bernard K. Lynch, Works Management 23.
The subject of Mr. Lynchs speech 
was civic leadership which was highly 
interesting and, though not a lengthy 
talk, was full of food for thought 
on the part of men about to go out 
into the world. Following Mr. 
Lynchs speech, Mr. McNeill called 
on each of the initiates to say a 
few words.
He then concluded by calling on 
President G. Vernon Becker, who 
thank d the toastmaster and M 
Lynch for their help in making the 
occasion a success, and welcomed 
the new brothers to the fraternity.

All EngineeringStudents Will 
Be Affectcd by New "1 
Curricula
A number-of important changes in 
the engineering curriculum will go 
into effect next fall. These changes 
affect the present freshmen as well 
as next years incoming class.
A course in General Metallurgy 
has been added to the engineering 
courses with the exception of the 
three science courses. This class will 
begin the second semester next year 
and will meet two hours per week.
In the Mathematics ipepartment, 
C-6 has been dropped from all 
engineering courses and C-5 has 
been reduced from nine to six units.
The Mechanics Course lias been 
redivided, making three semesters of 
nine units each instead of the pres
ent arrangement of two semesters of 
twelve units each. This is to enable 
the students to obtain a more 
thorough knowledge of mechanics by 
stretching the same course over a 
greater period of time.
The heat engineering option in the 
department of mechanical engineering 
has been altered. Heretofore, it car
ried much chemistry, but this amount 
has been reduced, in its place now 
appear: (1) a course in heat transfer, 
(2) additional work in combustion la
boratory, and (3) a thesis called 
Heat Engineering Reports. There 
has been an insistent demand for 
heat and furnace engineers, and the 
employment office and the mechani
cal engineering department have been 
unable to fill the demand..
Mr. Max M. Frocht, assistant 
professor of Mechanics at Carnegie 
Tech, has been granted a year and 
a halfs leave of abscncc from his 
capacity in the Institute to begin 
at the first of next semester. Pro
fessor Frocht has been engaged by 
the Soviet Government to serve as 
Assistant Chief Constructor in 
charge of the Technical Bureau of 
the Autostroy. The latter is part 
of a five year plan undertaken by 
the Soviet Government for the 
building of motor cars. Professor 
Frdebts employment is in connecI 
tion with a $30,000,000 contract be
tween the Ford Motor Company ,
and the Autostroy which calls for 
the supply of a certain ambunt of 
automobiles and parts to the So
viet government each year. In re
turn, the Ford Motor Company
will have access to any improve
ments and research that may be
accomplished in the new industry.
The original plan of the Auto
stroy was to build a plant of
100.000 cars per year capacity, but 
this has recently been increased to
120.000 cars per year. This plant

Banquet; Sophs Shear Plebes
With their customary thoroughness, 
handful of Sophs invaded the 
domesticity of the Freshmen Chemis
try Labarmed to the teeth with 
looping ladlesotherwise known as 
scissors. The freshmen, taken un
awares, went into a huddle, one of 
them even daring to propose the 
formation of a smoke screen with 
certain available combustible ma
terials, but this idea was discarded 
in favor of more submissive de
meanor. Gloatingljr, the Sophs ap
proached the underlings, shrinkingly 
the plebcs watched them approach 
till the3r could see the whites of 
the enemys eyes; and then, with 
wildly into what had been a Soph 
and what was now only airy empti
ness. This one-sided fray was soon 
terminated with the most uproarious 
of the rebels tucked soundb' under 
a stern Sophomoric arm, with his I
hair streaming in wild disorder while 
a beautiful Maltese Cross was 
hacked in the exact center. Fantastic 
designs were also superimposed upon 
other freshman heads, and an un
certain trail of hair was strewn 
about the hall outside the lab, to the 
amusement of upperclassmen overseeing the event.
Friday evening, January 17, the 
freshmen held a most successful 
class banquet in the famous Urban 
room of the William Penn Hotel.
However, the story begins Thurs

Requests for Mens 
Junior Prom Cdmps 
Refused By Council
At the Student Council meeting 
January 21 Mr. Sangster stated that 
requests for complimentary tickets 
to this year's Junior Prom have 
been made by Mr. Stauffer, presi
dent of last years Student Council, 
and Mr. Etheridge, chairman of 
last years Junior Prom Commit
tee. Although it has been the cus
tom to give the chairman of the 
Prom a complimentary ticket in 
his senior .year, it was recom
mended that since Mr. Etheridge 
is not attending Carnegie Tech 
this year, lie be refused a compli
mentary ticket. Although Mr. Stauf
fer is a student here, it was recom
mended that his request also be 
refused, since he is not connected 
with Council in any way this year 
and since it might be undesirable 
to start such a custom. Both of 
these recommendations were approved by Council.
Mrs. Cochrane, chairman of the 
Womens. Activities Point System 
Committee, recommended that Lois 
McGregor be permitted to  hold 
the office of program chairman of 
the Debating Club of Margaret 
Morrison, in addition to her other 
activities. She now holds the offices 
of president of the Margaret Mor

Dr. Van Essen Gives Illustrated 
Lecture To Social Problems Club
To most of us the term socialist 
calls up mental pictures of a turbu
lent individual badly in need of a 
shave, who waves a tattered red 
flag and wildly demands equality I" 
Although we were shown no repre
sentatives of Socialism in Dr, van 
Essens illustrated lecture Vienna 
An Experiment," our former mental 
picture was supplanted by that of a 
very old, very wise body of di
rectors who impersonally guided the 
reins of government/and in whom 
the masses reposed perfect confidencc. 
Our conversion was not immediate 
or hasty, but was gradually forced 
into our consciousness by his be
wildering array of facts and success
ful scientific experiments.
The World War and its ensuing 
treaties greatly reduced Austria, and 
necessity made a change in the 
government expedient; the Austrians,
being given permission to form a 
republic, voted that it be governed by 
Socialists, who immediately set out to 
solve the economic problem of hous
ing the masses, The past war with 
all its atrocities had reacted upon 
them much as a giant cyclonemany were left destitute and home
less, the country wa3 bankrupt and 
hopelessly in debt, all public utilities 
had been suspended because they did 
not pay; the prices had soared with 
alarming rapidity, and the value of 
money had been so deflated that the 
erstwhile ..prized kronen must now 
be accompanicd by half a million 
brother kronen before it will pur
chase more than a pint of milk I 
And so, these energetic socialists set 
to work on their housing project

they held their advantage until the 
close of the contest. Burns, Smith, 
and Siegal shared honors for the 
Plaid each scoring two field goals 
and playing good ball throughout.
Some of the most breath-taking 
basket ball ever seen in the new 
gym was witnessed by those specta
tors who arrived in time to witness 
the Plcbc-Kiski game, Saturday, Jan. 
18. Some of the flashiest plays of 
the season was witnessed in the last 
half when ICiski overcame an eight 
point lead and finally gained a one 
point margin with hut fifteen seconds 
remaining, to win the game 30-29.
Throughout the first half the 
Plcbes were complete masters of 
the situation and despite the fact that 
a number of their shots went wide 
of the mark the class of 33 was 
leading 16-11 at half time.
At the start of the third quarter 
the Plcbes increased their lead to

Carnegie Alumnus 
Lectures Before 
Civil Engineers
S. M. Sicsel, one of Carnegies 
first graduates in Civil Engineering, 
and president of the S. M. Sicsel 
Company, Engineers and Contrac
tors, returned to Carnegie last week 
to present an interesting and in
structive Iccture to the Civil En
gineering Seminar Socicty. The 
executives of the S. M. Sicsel 
Company arc all Carnegie gradu
ates, and it will be recalled that 
this concern is the one that .constructed our gymnasium.
Since completing his studies at 
the University of Charlottcnburg 
in Germany, Mr. Sicsel has been 
occupied with engineering contracts 
chiefly in the Middle West. ,
Mr. Sicsel described in detail the 
technicalities of\ building the foundation of the County Court Iiouso 
in Milwaukee. Examination of the 
soil showed that it was a hctcro-r 
gcncous mixture of clay, muck, sand, 
and limescraps deposited by 
the Glacier. For testing the bear
ing value, a hydraulic arm was con
nected to a slender iron billet 
which rested far underground on a 
flat cement block. A heavy load
was placed on top of the ram to
counterbalance the exerted pressure.
Another interesting engineering 
problem with which Mr. Siesel met 
was the cnlargmcnt and alteration 
of the Exchange National Bank of 
Tulsa, Oklahoma. Onthis particu
lar job, Superintendent Forrest H. 
Martcll, a former Carnegian, had 
Harold Cottrill, a recent graduate 
of Carnegie as his timekeeper. That 
portion of the first floor which was 
occupied by a large concrete column, 
cxlcnding the entire height of the 
building, was intended to be used 
as a lobby. The extraction of that
part of the column which piercedthe first floor presented the per
plexing problem. In order to do 
this a large section of the brick 
wall had to be torn down and the 
column had to be shored with 
ordinary housc-movcrs jacks, and 
large girders which were placed 
under the column. A lobby has 
been constructed in its placc and 
it is impossible to find any irregu
larities whatsoever in the building.
During the construction of a 
theater in Milwaukee, the earth 
was found to be so solid that piles 
could not be driven, and it was 
necessary to use a spread founda
tion, which after a number of 
years has proved to be highly efficient.

TAGE TWOTHE CARNE GTE TARTANTUESDAY, JANUARY 28, 1938
TWO MORE GAMES GONE FOREVER and two more 
heart-breakers for Carnegie. One to Geneva and one to Pitt, 
but its the first that hurts most'. That Geneva game, with two 
extra periods necessary before the men took the showers, was 
the closest one this year, and it isnt the fault of Captain Nease 
or Logan Webster that the score wasnt reversed. The scoring 
of 22 points against such a team as the Beavers is a fair nights 
work for any one man, arid that is the little stunt that Mr. 
Nease pulled off before the startled foemen. Not content with 
this, our George, with his loyal band, treked up the hill to the 
Stadium on Friday and demonstrated the fact that he, too, de
serves the name of Chipper if that little surname means any
thing in a basketball way.
About that Pitt game, it was a fairly good evenings en
tertainment Per usual, it was mostly Charlie and George, with
a new play from the fertile mind of Doc Carlson, the Panther 
coach, as an added attraction. .The play was good and boosted 
Pitts stock considerably, but, it wasnt too hard for our squad 
to solve. Which is enough about Pitt until February 25.* * * +
WE HAVE LEARNED that a matter of only two points 
per game separates the total scoring, thus far, of Captain Nease 
and Captain Hyatt. It would seem as though the Pittite was 
going to get cY run for his money, or rather for his honors, this 
year. If we were inclined to be witty, we would say that Hyatt 
is'rapidly developing into a second Nease.* * :H *
TOMORROW NIGHT the Westminster contingent will 
make its annual invasion. Our boys are*Veady for them, though, 
and we wouldnt be a bit surprised to see a victory for Car
negie. These New Wilmington boys, however, are distinctly 
on this year, and furnish some real entertainment. As you 
will notice under their squad picture, at the right, they were 
nominated as Pittsburgh district champions last year by the 
Associated Pressand that means something. With a man, 
John I<awther, at the helm who is at once a professor of psy
chology, a football star, an athletic director and a basketball 
.coach, the Westminster team ought to be versatile, at least. 
Heres hoping that he doesnt psych our boys tomorrow.* * * >*
QUOTING FROM A LOCAL NEWS SHEET, The Car
negie Tech basketball team is a much better team than its 
record shows. And again, Tech has been looking good, even 
though losing.
And if you want to give credit where credit Is due, tip the 
Stetsons to Coach Ralph Hogan. Mr. Hogan has worked won
ders with the Carnegie squad thus far, so letB get behind him 
and boost for the better things which will come with time. ..* * * *
THE PLEBES HAD TOUGH GOING last week and 
suffered their third one-point defeat of the season, at the hands 
of the Geneva Reserves. 25-24 was the final count, the Genevans 
overcoming a six-point Plcbc lead in the final minutes of play.
On Friday, the Panther Cubs turned in their second win 
over the Plcbcs, 26-19. Pitt started off to good advantage and 
.secured an eight-point lead. From then on, it was just a game. 
The Plcbes, however, have done better than any Carnegie team 
in years. Let us hope that they keep it up.? * x<  *
AFTER THE SECOND SEMESTER rolls around, the 
Greeks and the Dorm boys will be at it, hammer and tongs, 
in the various Intra-Mural Basketbnll leagues. .Silver loving 
cups arc awarded to the winners in the three groupsand they 
look nice on any mantel.
The officials for the games this season will be the same 
ones as last year, and the year before, namely, Swimming Coach 
Kisedorph and Paul Perrazelli. These two men have proven 
their worth by their past work, and, needless .to say, refereeing 
those rough and tumble league games is no picnic.+ * + +

(Continued from Page One) liis team in the lead, hut Martin of 
Geneva scored a field goal in the 
final seconds of play to again tie the 
'tcorc. Another extra period was 
played in which' Geneva acorcd three 
points to give them a final lead of 
38-35.'
Piitt Game
Friday, January 24, Carnegies 
basketball squad continued their los
ing stride by dropping another one to 
I lie fast stepping Pitt team, *18-25. 
The Panther quintet, with Eddie 
Baker hack in the game, was a 
stronger team than the one that 
faced the Tartans in the opening tilt 
of the scries. A hew play, which 
Coach Carlson has evidently just per
fected, enabled the Pittites to get a 
number of pot shots in the im
mediate neighborhood of the basket.
The Skibos secured a small lead 
in the first few minutes of play when 
Fox made a field goal which Nease 
followed with a foul. Pitt was quick 
to conic back,with a couple of twopointers which gave them a one point 
advantage. A moment later Jimmy 
Traa tied' the count by making good 
his throw from the foul line. At 
this stage of the game Baker re
placed Kowallis and from this point 
on, it was a different story. Pitt start
ed a dazzling passing attack which 
the bewildered Tartans were unable 
to check. This attack would usually
end with Hyatt, Arture or Baker 
getting a shot unhindered. The 
Panthers continued piling up their 
lead for the rest of the half at the 
end of which they held a twelve 
point margin.
In the second half George Nease 
and Logan Webster continued the 
stride that has kept Carnegie in the 
running every game this year,' and 
were a, constant threat to the great 
Pitt Icani. Captain Nease was sec
ond only to Hyatt in total scoring, 
with a total of thirteen points to the 
Panther aces fifteen. The principal 
reason for losing is , the same as 
Notre Dame, Montana, and the rest 
of the schools use when explaining 
their defeattoo much Hyatt. He 
was all over the floor, passing, block
ing, guarding and shooting baskets 
from all angles. With the Pitt 
leader in great form, his team-mates 
gave him enough help to keep t|ie 
load increasing as time went on. 
When the final whistle blew Pitt was 
leading *18-25. The Plaid followers 
have a promising outlook in future 
basketball with Pitt, for this year 
Hyatt leaves school and without 
Hyatt, our  rivals will undoubtedly 
lose their supremacy in basketball.

Coacb, John Lawthers Westminster College basketball team, with a record of 47 victories in 56 games played during the last tfare 
seasons, hopes to retain its high position in the tri-staUj district this year. The United Presbyterians pin their hopes on Captain Glenn 
ODonovan and Kenneth Dclahnnty, ali-confcrcncc forwards; and on William Crowell, Phillip Rice, John Hamas, Marshall Fisher, Michael 
Koclieran, and Harry Brownlee, all veterans. ODonovan, Dclahnnty, and Crowell are playing their fourth and last year for Westminster.
Last season the Titans were given the Pittsburgh district championship by the Associated Press with a record of 15 victories out of 17 
tarts. In the 1927-28 campaign, Lawthers men won the Tri-Stat Conference championship. A schedule of 16 games with district op
ponents starts Jan. 3 at Grove City and ends March 4 at Duqucsne this year.
Reisdorph And Perrizelli To Rule
At Intra-mural Basketball Games
At the regular meeting of the Intra
mural Basketball League last Tues
day, several important measures 
were decided. The meetings, as 
previously held, arc to be on Tues
days at 4:30 in the Trophy room of 
the Gym. A roll call is taken at 
the beginning of each meeting and 
the absent members fined 50 cent as 
in previous years. The Constitution 
directs that this fine is to be taken 
from the registration fee, but as the 
funds of the league are usually ex
hausted at the end of the season, 
this provision has meant nothing. 
This year, a new amendment has 
been added that provides that the ac
cumulated lines of the year previous 
must be paid before registration is 
permitted. This measure should 
help to keep interest alive toward 
the end of the season.
Another important ruling was made 
in regard to postponed games. In 
past years, there has been some laxness in the observance of this rule 
and some hard feelings have resulted 
from misunderstandings in regard to 
it. The rule is to be the same as 
last year, but this year it is to be 
enforced strictly. No game can be 
postponed unless notice is given at 
least twenty-four hours previous to 
the time it is scheduled to be played. 
The president'must be consulted at 
the time of postponement.
The officials this year are Paul 
Perrizelli and A. E. Reisdorph. Since 
the appointment of these men two 
years ago, the brand of basketball 
played in the league has steadily 
improved. Last year, for the first 
time, not a man was forced to 
leave the games on account of in
juries. Perrizelli has had six years 
experience and Reisdorph thirteen 
years, and they are probably the 
best men in school available for the 
positions. Refereeing has been elose 
and impartial and their decisions are 
generally well met. The league is 
fortunate in having these men for a 
third year.
A new team will be seen for the 
first time this year. The new na
tional faternity Tan Delta Phi was 
admitted at the previous meeting and 
has been placed in the National 
League.
The following officers were clectcd 
previously and last week assumed 
office:
President, V. I,. Bohden, McGill; 
vice-president, F. E. Foote, Phi Kappa 
Psi, and sccretary-treasurer, E. A. 
Murray, Sigma Nu.

fouled when attempting a field goal. 
He missed on his first attempt but 
sunk his second free throw for 
what proved to be the winning point 
for there was barley time left to put 
the ball back iiito play again before 
the game ended.
Hendrickson was outstanding for 
the Prep school lads scoring over 
half their points and playing a fine 
floor game throughout. Stentz lead 
the Plebe scoring and shared honors 
with Fergus who again turned in a 
fine floor game. The Plebes ap
peared superior throughout the game 
but missed many shots from under 
the Kiski basket.
Friday the Plcbcs scored their first! 
victory on their home court when 
they downed the Wayncsburg Ren 
serves 27-22. The Plebes were de-^ 
cidedly off form and it was not until 
the last quarter that they clinched the. 
ill earned victory.
Early in, the game the Plebes got 
pit to a six point lead but at the cue} 
of the half / the score was , tied at 
ten all. During the second half the 
lead sec-sawed hack and forth until 
late jn the forth quarter when the 
Plebes scored several field goals to 
clinch the verdict. The Plebes would 
doubtless have scorcd many more 
points if they had not missed so 
many easy shots. Smith was tin* 
only Carnegie man to put up any
thing like* his usual game sinking six 
field goals.
Friday night the Plebes * suffer
ed their second defeat ot the sea
son at the hands of the Pitt 
Freshmen at the Stadium floor. 
The Baby Panthers led throughout 
the contest with the game ending 
25-16 in their favor.
The Pitt boys bewildered the 
Plaid during, the first few minutes 
of play, pilling up an eight point 
lead early in the game. Suddenly 
the Tartans found themselves and 
from that point until the final 
whistle the game was on even 
terms with both teams playing a 
lively, fast cutting game.
Alpert lead the scoring for 
Pitt, biit Rodgers was the main 
cog in the blue and gold offense* 
playing a -wonderful floor game 
and sinking a couple . of two 
pointers. Smith and Fergus were 
the only Plebes to find the basket 
from the floor, but the whole 
team did exceptionally well oil

Plaid Marksmen 
On Trophy Hunt
The Tartan riflers have com
pleted what might be called their 
preliminary matches of the season 
with a fine record. During the 
two weeks of examinations, the 
marksmen will be aiming at marks 
not to be found on targets, except 
for those who wish to keep in trim 
by an occasional shootout.
With the beginning of the 
second semester, the team will re
open, activities on the range, shoot
ing against the leading schools of 
the country. The scores of all the 
matches except shoulder-to-shoulder 
meets arc exchanged by mail. A 
comparison is made, and the high
est tally takes the meet. The 
scores for a week are exchanged 
by several schools; so that to carry 
away the honors, the high-point 
teams mUst top the scores of all 
the competing schools for that 
week.
Much interest in the sport has 
been aroused by the formatidn, 
each year, of a district league 
known as the Pennsylvania, West 
Virginia, and Ohio Intercollegiate 
League. The entrants, eight in 
number, arc Penn State, University 
o f Pennsylvania, University o f 
Pittsburgh, Drexcl Institute, Uni
versity of West Virginia, Cincin
nati, Cleveland School of Tech
nology, and Carnegie. The Plaids 
will fire their first league match 
against Pitt the week ending Feb
ruary 15. The following weeks 
they will shoot against Cleveland, 
Cincinnati, Penn, Drexel, West 
Virginia, and Penn Stated
The week ending January 18, 
the Skibos opposed Massachusetts

Watch For Opening
To Sportswomen
There was an interesting articlc 
by Miss Clark in the January edi
tion of "The Sportswomen con
cerning a sports philosophy for 
women. Miss Clark does not pre
tend to offer a philosophy of life, 
but she does try to give us an idea 
of how athletics should fit into the 
college womans scheme of living, 
not only while she is in college, 
but after she has left.
By an active part in our school 
athletics we can be of. service to 
each other. We can aid our fel
low student who is not as skilled 
as we to increase his skill and 
thereby increase his enjoyment of 
the game. By our personal con
tacts on the gym floor or in the 
pool we  can broaden our social 
life by building up friendships that 
arc* based on a clean, sportman
like competition.
As wc grow older, Miss Clark 
says, w'e play less frequently, *not 
because we are less interested in 
athletics, butbecause other things 
have crowded into our busy col
lege lives. Nevertheless, even the 
college woman should play at 
least an hour each day and play 
vigorously and intelligently to get 
everything from the sport that she 
can, because it is necessary for her 
health that she does so.
One of the most interesting sug
gestions in the article is that we 
women, who sometimes forget how 
to play, should learn how from the 
men. It is a generally-known fact 
that the men may be rcadjr to 
strike each other down and then 
afterwards to stroll off to. the golf 
course with no memory of that 
former antagonism. This code of 
sportmanship is almost unknown 
among women, perhaps because 
they arc more sensitive to injury 
than men, or perhaps their memory 
is longer. Miss Clark suggests 
that it would be profitable for our 
after-school Uvcs if we should try 
to cultivate this spirit of play that 
every normal man knows so well.
By an active participation in our 
schoof' sports we have many op
portunities to develop that leader
ship which is becoming a vital 
part of every womans life. There 
is more responsibility resting upon 
a woman today than there ever 
has been before, and it is the duty 
of every woman to be able to 
meet that responsibility as well as 
she can.
When school days are over there 
is an opportunity to carry on the 
spirit of healthy play in the home 
community. The college woman 
with her educational background 
and her four-year experience on 
the gym floor can be of valuable 
service in the organization of com
munity teams or the formation of
community sporting clubs.
Every woman should take part 
in some kind of sport. For the 
woman who is unable to play the 
strenuous games there are the 
archery, rifle, golfing, and hiking 
sports. It is not even necessary 
that she be skillful, for the joy of 
the game isthe thing that counts. 
The important thing is that she 
participates. We must not let life 
become too serious. We must not 
forget HOW to play.
Basketball
There will be no scheduled 
basketball practices during the ex 
animation period. The last basket 
ball practice before exams will be 
held on Thursday, January 31 
Practice willbe resumed for the 
second semester on Thursday, Feb
ruary 13. This allows less than s 
month more of practices before 
the interclass games, which will be 
played* the first of March. Harriet 
Hanna, basketball' manager, wishes 
to remind all women that the W. 
A. A. will award practice or team 
points only to those who have at
tended over half of^ the total 
number of practices.
Swimming 
The aquatic meet which annually 
terminates the swimming season is 
scheduled .to take place during the 
first week of March. Each woman 
should keep in mind those events 
in which she will most likely par
ticipateand then practice accord
ingly. Within tin next few days, 
Suzanne Knorr, swimming man
ager, will post a list of events on 
the W. A. A.' Bulletin Board in the 
Gym. All girls interested are re
quested to sign their names op-. 
posite the events in which they 
wish to compete.
All women who are out for rifle 
should have at least 18 practices 
by the w'eck ending January 25. 
By the end of the season, or the 
week ending April 11, 30 practices 
will be required to get W. A. A. 
practice points.
This week the Women's Rifle 
Team fired a match with the 
Massachusetts Agricultural College 
and the University of Missouri.
The N. R. A. matches will begin 
the week ending February 8, One 
stage, consisting of two targets, 
will be fired each week for three 
weeks. The six targets must be 
fired and . in by the week eliding 
February 22. The girls who are 
to fire in the N. R. A. matches are 
as follows: Floy Sample, Isabel
Sheppard, Helen Whitehill, Mary 
Crage, Cora Lee Henk, Ruth

New Schedules To Be 
Put Into Effect Next Year
At the Night Engineering ban
quet held last month, Dr, Ihrig in 
his address mentioned several 
changes which are to take place 
next year. The first of these con
cerns registration in September. 
He said that the early registra
tion held for the first time this 
year was very successful and that 
next year this will be repeated. 
The gymnasium will be used as 
well as the Union and the Faculty 
Club room. This should help con
siderably.
The work of the first semes
ter chemistry class will be repeated 
in the second semester for those 
who must repeat it. This will rem
edy a very bad condition which has 
existed and which very many stu
dents have felt. The students who 
received an R were required to 
drop from the regular class despite 
the fact that they had paid for the 
whole year. Many of them entered 
classes, in the Industries school, but 
this did not help them towards! 
tliciir objective. By taking the first; 
semester work in this manner they 
can continue with the second 
semester work in the supplemen
tary term and be ready to start 
their second year work in the fall 
with a clean slate.
A change was announced also 
for the mechanics schedule. This 
will be a three-year subject in 
place of 'two years as it is now. 
In place of three hours a week the 
new schedule will call for only two 
hours and the third year work will 
be taught in the supplementary 
term. This will lighten the work 
of the year which the old timer 
says is the toughest of all.
The changcs were loudly ., ap
plauded by those present and
Our CouncilWe Are 
Proud Of Its WorkSecond Semester 
For Night 
Students Begins
Many New Students Reg
istered in Classes
With the close of school last 
Friday evening, the first semester 
was brought to an end. The ter
mination of examinations, for a few 
months at least, was a joy for all 
which may be dissipated to wails 
of sorrow when the marks are 
sent out. Time will tell as it 
usually does.But what has passed and what 
has been done cannot be changed 
now so lets make the best of it 
and turn the .second semester into 
something worth while. With the 
second semester now under way 
there are now, and will be more, 
new faces in the various class
rooms and shops. To the new stu
dents, we welcome you and sin
cerely hope that you succeed in 
your purpose. May wre suggest, to 
make the load a little lighter for 
'you, that you participate in the 
activities and in other ways take 
an active interest in your school. 
Dont become too mechanical. To 
the older students, tell the new
comer about your school, what we 
arc, what we do here; get him ac
quainted and make him feel at 
home.
This is the good  old. Carnegie 
spirit of fellowship and loyalty. 
With every student co-operating 
with his fellow student and the in
structors, we are bound to succeed 
in our endeavors.  When May rolls 
around we find that we really have 
accomplished something and that 
fact alone will make you forget the 
sacrifices you are making now for 
your education. G.
The Plaid is pleased to continue 
publishing the names of night stu
dents who donated their Breakage 
Deposits towards the Carnegie En
dowment Fund, last year. The 
whole amount was credited to
wards the contemplated Student 
Activities Building, a building
which we hope will soon rise on 
the campus.

proved that the night students ap
preciate the efforts being made by 
the administration to better their, 
conrses: '
An article in a Pittsburgh daily 
during the past week told of a let
ter written b'y the editon of the 
"Pitt Weekly" to the Student 
Council of that school in which 
lie branded this body as an ''un
usually inefficient group who con
tributed nothing to the welfare of 
the student body.
What a blessing that such a con
dition does not exist on our own 
Campus among the Night Students. , 
We of the "Plaid are proud of 
our Council and have always work
ed together with that body in per
fect harmony. Your school paper, 
in which this is printed, would not , 
be the successful publication it is 
if it were not for the untiring ef
forts of Mr. E. E. McDonald. 
Upon assuming, the duties of presi
dent of the Night Student Council 
last  year, his first move was to 
give the Night Students a weekly 
newspaper. After overcoming many 
obstacles lie succeeded in having 
a page of the "Tartan reserved 
for news of the three night 
colleges and thereby giving to all 
students of Carnegie a complete, 
record of all happenings on the 
Campus.
The above discourse is only a 
bit of information to refresh your 
memory that the Plaid is a 
product of the Night Student 
Council -and we have nothing but 
praise for that body which attends 
to the welfare of the Night Stu
dents. ,
The Night Student Council has 
always held the best interests of 
the night student body above all 
others that come to its attention. 
It is always ready to co-operate 
with the day Student Council in all 
questions concerning both student 
bodies. This was exemplified about 
a year ago when both Councils 
worked' together for the return of 
Campus week. We might add that 
the Tartan and Plaid co-oper
ated by publishing ballots for the 
opinion of the entire student body 
on the same question.
It is indeed very gratifying to 
have the successful students or
ganizations .that we have here at 
Carnegie. . Each body has reached 
such, successful heights because it 
has worked, andco-operated with 
the other' organizations on the 
campus; and riot by slinging mud 
and knocking the other fellow to 
make him appear small, as seems 
to be the pwicticc on the other 
side of Forbes street. G.
My, what a relief. The Exams. 
are over, and now we shout for 
joy. Speaking of "Exams. how
ever, I. was initiated into another 
idiom of the Arts vocabulary 
"Judgment. When I heard this 
first, I was frightened, as I thought 
I was going to be called by "Ga
briel and kept wondering what I 
would say and do. During the 
past week I found out that this 
awe inspiring word of the Arts 
nomenclature was none other than 
the term applied by the Profs, to 
their examination of the work or 
plates which the students turn in for the semester. Judgmentit 
does have a terrifying sound at 
best, and more so if you arc not 
prepared to stand it by having all 
you work up. If I keep on in 
Arts, I will know' everything from 
the basement, where they mix the 
mud, to the fifth floor, where pret
ty pictures are painted, and how.
A rather amusing incident occur
red the other evening while I was 
walking to classes, and I feel that 
I should let the rest of the stu: 
dents in on the know, too. You 
know they talk about the Jay 
Walkers, but how about the Jay 
Drivers? Did you tiver see one of 
these? Well, you see it is just like 
this. A fellow will be .in a car and 
driving along, when all of a sudden 
his attention will be diverted to 
something; it may be a group of 
"pretty women, or an unusual build
ing, or a bridge, or a large volume 
of smoke, at all events, he will be 
looking everywhere except in front 
of him, where he is supposed to 
Then all of a sudden lie finds that 
instead of his car moving, the 
pavement, or tree, or pole, has 
taken life and walked right in front 
of him only to discover that he 
has wrecked or injured his car and 
the offending obstacle hasnt been 
injured at all. Now I think the 
state authorities should examine 
this type .of driver, and if they are 
found to be suffering from amne
sia,; then they should insist that, 
they be accompanied by an attend
ant who will prod them in times 
of danger. I was witness to such 
an occurrence recently on the cam
pus, and thought a suggestion as 
to jay drivfcrs was a good one. 
I wont, however, take out a patent 
on it.
Our Stop and Go light hasnt as 
3'et materialized at Forbes and 
Morewood avenue. I presume the 
city has run out of these safety de
vices and are only waiting a new 
shipment. At all events, lets hope 
so, as it is surely needed. If they 
dont put one there soon, I sup
pose I will have to stand on the 
' corner myself, and direct the traf
fic. Idle student, you know, I 
should have something to keep me 
busy, and what better pastime than 
directing traffic; Who knows?

when the Night College of Fine

the season. This is scheduled for 
February 8, and will be held in the 
Union.
We need only refresh our mem
ory a little to go back to the eve
ning of the first function of this 
group which was held on Decem
ber 7. It was a most delightful 
party, and something was doing 
the whole evening. Good music, 
lots of fun, and an abundance of 
refreshments, in fact nothing was 
left undone to make the several 
.-hours spent here a pleasant memory.
The committee has had meetings 
to work out plans for the function*, 
but they are keeping what secrets 
they have up their sleeves" as 
they say. However, you can rest 
assured that all you need to do is 
to get your date fixed and attend.
All night art students should be 
on hand to help make  this the

THINK IT OVER
O men who have condemned me, 
I would fain prophesy to you; for 
I am about to die, and in the hour 
of death men are gifted with pro
phetic power. And I prophesy to 
you who are my murderers, that 
immediately after my departure 
punishment far heavier than you 
have inflicted on me will surely 
await you. Me you have killed be
cause you wanted to escape the 
accuser, and not to give an ac
count of your lives. But that will 
not be as you suppose; far other
wise. For I say that there will be 
more accusers of you than there 
are now; accusers whom hitherto 
I have restrained; and as they arc 
younger they will be more incon
siderate with you, and you will be 
more offended at them.
If you think that by killing m6n 
you can prevent some one from 
censuring your evil lives, you are 
mistaken; that is not a way of Es
cape which is either possible or 
honorable; the easiest and the 
noblest way is not to be disabling 
others, but to be improving -yorirsclvcs.
There is great reason to hope 
that death is a good; for one of 
two thingseither death is a state 
of nothingness and utter uncon
sciousness, or, as men say, there 
is a change and migration of the 
soul from this worldto another. 
Now if you suppose that there is 
no consciousness, but a sleep like 
the sleep of him who is undis
turbed even by dreams, death will 
be an unspeakable gain. If death 
be of such a nature, I say that to 
die is gain; for eternity is then 
only a single night.
But if death is the journey #to 
another place-, and there, as men 
say, all the dead abide, what good, 
O my friends and judges, can be 
greater than this? If indeed when 
the pilgrim arrives in the world be
low, he is delivered from the pro
fessors of justice in this world and 
finds the true judges who arc said 
to give judgment there, that pil
grimage will be worth making. 
What would not a man give if he 
might converse with Orpheus and 
Museaeus and Hesiod and Homer? 
Nay, if this be true, let me die 
again and again.
Above all, I shall then be able 
to continue my search into true 
and false knowledge; as in this 
world, so also in the next; and I 
shall find out who is wise, and 
who pretends to be wise and is 
not. What would not a man give.
0 judges, to be able to examine 
the leader of the great Trojan ex
pedition; or Odysseus or Sisyphus, 
or numberless others, men and 
women too! What infinite delight 
would there be in conversing with 
them and asking them questions! 
In another world they do not put 
a man to death for asking ques
tions; assuredly not. For besides 
being happier than we are, they 
will be immortal, if what is said 
is true.
Wherefore, O judges, be of good 
cheer , about death, and know of a 
certainty, that no evil can happen 
to a good man, either in life or 
after death. He and his arc not 
neglected by the gods; nor has my 
own approaching end happened by 
mere chance. But I see clearly 
that the time had arrived when it 
was better for me to die and to 
be released from trouble; where
fore the oracle gave no sign. For 
which reason, also, I am not angry 
with my condcmncrs, or with my 
accusers; they have done me no 
harm, although they did not mean 
to do me any good, and for this
1 may gently blame them.
Still I have, a favor to ask of 
them. When my sons arc grown 
up, I would ask you, 0 my friends, 
to punish them, and I would have 
you trouble them, as I have 
troubled you, if they seem to care 
about riches, or anything, more 
than about virtue; if of they pre
tend to be something when they 
arc really nothingthen reprove 
them, as I have reproved you, for 
not caring about that for which 
they ought to care, and thinking 
that they arc something when they 
arc really nothing. And if you d<> 
this, both I and my sons will have 
received justice at your hands.
The hour of departure has ar
rived and we go our waysI to 
die, and you to live. Which is bet
ter God only knows.

Thistledown suggests the following' 
review exam questions to his readers.
Solid Geometry. Explain the 
geometrical obscurities in the following lines:
Euclid alone has looked on Beauty bare.
Let all who prate of Beauty hold 
their peace,
And lay them prone upon the 
earth' and cease 
To ponder on themselves, the while 
they stare 
|\t nothing, intricately drawn no
where
In shapes of shifting lineage ....
Masonry. Name three mortars 
suitable  for the construction of a 
new Carnegie library and give the 
composition of each. Why would 
an Inundator be important in the 
construction of a new brick girls' dorm ?
Advanced Heat. Compute on 
the basis of the specifications giv
en above the amount of time it 
takes the average instructor to 
raise the temperature of his class
room two degrees Fahrenheit by 
talking. Make the same computa
tion for Mr. Pfouts.
Calculus., Comment on the fol
lowing from S. P. Tlipmpsons 
"Calculous Made Easy (Macmil
lan): "Considering how many fools 
can calculate, it is surprising that 
it should be thought either a diffi
cult or a tedious task for any 
other fool to learn how to master 
the same tricks. Some calculous tricks 
arc quite easy. Some arc enormously 
difficult. The fools who write the 
textbooks of advanced mathematics 
and they are mostly clever fools 
seldom take the trouble to, show 
you how easy the  calculations arc.
On the contrary, they seem to de* 
sire to impress you with their tre
mendous cleverness by going about 
it in the most difficult way. Being 
myself a remarkably stupid fellow,
I have had to untcach myself the 
difficulties, and now beg to present 
to my fellow fools the parts that 
arc not hard. Master these thor: Q 
oughly, and the rest will follow. 
What one fool can do, another can.
Nutrition. Pick out sonic mem
ber of the faculty who is too fat, iy
some member of the faculty who 
is too thin, and calculate the diet 
each should follow to attain the 
proper degree of rotundity.
Story Telling. Imagine that you 
went out driving with a young man 
one evening expecting to get back 
at eleven in time to write an Eng
lish theme, but that because of en
gine trouble you do not get back 
until half past twelve. What story 
would you tell the house mother, .
the dean of women, your room
mate, your English instructor?
Cooking. Name the various kind 
of steaks served at the grill, and 
indicate the different animals from 
which these arc cut. Name any 
kind of cheap meat you can think 
of that has not been on a grill special.
Social Resources. Just make a 
list of your social resources.
Color. What is the proper color 
for daylight, sunlight, moonlight, .< 
electric light? In your opinion, 
which kind best combines perma
nency and tastcfulricss.
Its too cold to go on. Thistle
down is going to leave his room 
under the roof and go down to sitin front of the fraternity house 
fire. Even typewriter oil congeals 
in this kind of weather. But dont 
forget to sharpen your pencils and fool them profs.

At 6:30 a handsome herd of plcbcs 
gathered in the Urban room. The 
two guests of honor were led up
stairs. During the trip "Chuck 
Ewing managed to make his cscapc. 
One guest, however, still remained.
The banquet got under way and 
the plcbcs enjoyed a hearty turkey 
dinner. Bill Barnett, Morg Nelson, 
and' the Carnegie Tartans did not 
have much trouble keeping everyone 
amused during and after the dinner.
The position of toastmaster was 
ably filled by Prdfcssor Kirkpatrick 
of the English Department. Short 
talks which were greatly enjoyed 
by everyone were given by Mr.

most successful banquet l',at ^ias l)ccn held at Carnegie Tech, This year's 
plcbcs arc fast establishing a reputa

making them successful. Heres hop

was born in Paris in 1901, educat
ed at the Luccc Henri Quatre, and 
later studied at the Sarbonnc. 
In 1920 he worked for Edgar 
Brandt as designer and model mak
er in hammered iron, did consid
erable research by himself on the 
subject of batiks. After leaving 
the army in 1923, he organized a 
plant for the production of batiks, 
and with several assistants, pro
duced them on a fairly large scale 
for commercial firms.
In 1926 he came to the United 
States and has lived in New York 
City ever since. During these past 
three years he has" done work of 
various kinds in painting and de
signing, but his principal work, 
and that upon which he is concen
trating more and more, is in the 
field in which he most wishes to 
specialize: mural decoration. Most 
of the drawings in the exhibition 
wiil-be studies for his mural deco
rations.
When the call comes for ah ex
hibition of American paintings in 
Europe, the Department of Fine 
Arts is always pleased to repay its 
debts. At present, visitors to the 
galleries of the Institute will mis*
Several social fraternities plan to 
hold breakfast parties following the

The Unknown Quantity
Mid-yearheralded by thoughts of calamity, approaches, 
and like time and tide, sweeps before it all things. So we are 
swept, each one to his destiny, some soar to heights, others are 
shoved aside. To the conspientious student mid-year examina
tions should mean nothing but a final statement of material 
knowledge derived from vigorous exposure to the elements, 
namely professors and books. To the one-who waits until the 
last minute, it looms as an insurmountable barrier.
We hear it often said that grades are not a measure of 
ones ability, but just a necessary evil. Perhaps they mean 
nothing, provided they are comfortably above passing and pro
vided the student has gained something from his courses of 
study. However, this theory of marks is all too often used as 
an excuse for laziness and stupidity. Perhaps the_ lazy one 
will snap oiit of it and in later years prove successful despite 
his low marks, but the stupid one is not meant to have an 
education, his college life is merely a waste of time, better that 
he leave, than waste time and money on an education which 
leaves no impression.
Cramming for an examination never does any real good, 
whatever is gained is soon forgotten. Remember the memory 
curve! And what good is forgotten college education? Our 
memories alone should not be considered. He who waits until 
the last minute, learns temporarily, but loses all of that which 
is truly education, the ability to use his head to produce the 
right result at the right time. He has yet to learn that he can
not fool himselfhis grades may be fairly high, his tongue may 
wag easily, he may be convinced of his own importance, but 
an empty head always betrays its possessor.
All these admonitions against cramming do not mean con
cluding our studies the iast day of the term. Our memories 
are not perfect, by any means. Sometimes questions on some 
obscure subjects appear on examinations, which certainly do 
not test the student or give him a fair chance to prove the 
value of his education.
Perhaps there is no need of dwelling at length on the pit
falls of examinations; they are but momentary pauses Xo assure 
ourselves that we are not falling by the wayside. If you know 
nothing, say nothing, you may fool someone; if you know some
thing, tell it all, give the world a break. Tech News.

had been done for the past six 
years.) They tore down the un
sightly slums and built mammoth 
apartmcnt-houscs accommodating 7,- 
000 families (which is quite a little 
pile of stones, cvcp in this sky
scraper age!) Clamors arose from 
the four corners of Vienna (if any 
corncrs were left after the territory 
had been lopped offand redivided) 
from-people filing claims for habita
tion in the ncwly-crcctcd buildings, 
until they had reached the fotal of 
45,000 the first month. It was ex
tremely dear to the gentlemen in 
Vienna that, not evenby direct 
methods of strategy could 45,000 
families be wedged into space pro
portionate for one-sixth of their num
ber. And so, with due solemnity and 
with the sagacity of Solomon they 
surreptitiously dispatched agents to 
investigate housing conditions among 
the applicants. When the results 
were learned, the 7,000 then living 
n the worst tenements were given 
preference. The disgruntledland
lords, now tenantless, had to repair 
their shameful dwellings in order 
to re-rent them; often the city com
manded that they be torn down on 
the charge of being public eyesores.
The newly-erectcd apartments were 
made of permanent structure and 
material, with allowance for deprecia
tion made in the calculation of rental. 
They are modern and sanitary, and 
considering the deplorable but never
theless authentic fact that previous 
to this time 95% of the working 
class had no bathing facilities, 
but had remained in their parlous 
state of unwashed ignorance, it is 
not surprising that they received 
their new living quarters with un
animous approbation. The smallest 
apartment consists of two rooms, a 
bath and a kitchena veritable Eden 
of spaciousness . after their cramped 
quarters. The rent of each room 
is the nominal sum of $1.50 a month, 
or, for the better rooms, $4 or $5; 
it is low because their eiarning power 
is practically negligible. Every room 
must have at least one window, ex
patiates John Law, and by strictly 
enforcing this condition they have re
duced the tuberculosis rate to onethird of the pre-war rate. Also, the 
public morale has been greatly im
proved, and the people instilled with 
a desire to live up to their sur
roundings.
An expert on finance aided them 
in their task, and it was under his 
guidance that the stupendous re
form has been accomplished. All 
owners of unoccupied land (which, 
when held, in idleness was a draw
back to the community) were com
pelled . to pay much higher taxes; 
as an alternative the cit}' offered to 
buy the land at pre-war prices plus 
20% (note the canny financial in
fluence here!), -until, at present, they 
have taken over 26% of the land 
within its limits.
The wants of the people have been 
consulted, and, as far as possible, 
have been gratified. Their life is 
a community one and everyone co
operates in a manner entirely un
known this side of the occan, and in 
a way that is impossible to effect in 
private dwellings. A center court 
provides a playground for the chil
dren and is also instrumental in 
keeping them off the streets. Public 
swimming pools have also been in
stituted, each one conveniently lo
cated near three or four apartment 
houses (of which there are many 
now), and there.is an elaborate sys
tem of regulation so that everyone 
may use them. Included in each 
community center arc three or four 
laundries, a librar}', and dental and 
medical clinics. They are given in
structions in diet regulation, and are 
taught proper living conditions. In 
conjunction with the new community 
spirit arc the kindergartens, of which 
there are'now fourteen.' Here anemic 
children arc given rest in the sun
light under special attention, and 
every effort is made to give them 
a health}', happy childhood. The walls 
are painted by artists who offered 
their services free in recognition of 
the united efforts to instill in the 
people. a sense of appreciation for 
the beautiful.
The city has a monopoly on all 
public utilities, and as their patronage 
increases the rates are proportionally 
lowered, so that wealth is kept even
ly distributed and in free circulation. 
Had Pittsburgh adopted this system, 
as all the soap-box orators advocate, 
the . taxi strike would have been 
avoided, the gas and electricity bills 
would not be so alarmingly elevated, 
and maybealthough this is only a 
Utopian fancythe trolleys would be 
on time and be piloted by obliging 
individuals. Vienna, with a popula
tion of two millionfour times that 
of Pittsburghhas 140 million dol
lars in property values. Taxes are 
heterogenous in number and sundry 
as to purpose, but suffice it to say 
that they include entertainment, motor 
cars, advertisement, land and incre
ment value and many others. The 
servant problem apparently does not 
bother them very much, and the 
government even had the audacity 
to tax families employing more than 
one servant. Prohibition and its at
tendant evils are unknown; the beer 
tax is exorbitant and strangely 
enoughin the land of the frothloving, beer-draining Austrians, not an 
objection to the tax is raised, and 
the Socialist government gaily pro
ceeds in its spurious path to uni
versal democracy.

meetings held three or four times 
a year.
Now is the time when the pro
fessors are sitting on top of the 
world, as far as the average stu
dent is concernedthe period in 
which we find the characteristic 
lull before the storm. The stu
dents arc digging trenche, dusting 
off their books, and preparing to 
drink many cups of black coffcc in 
preparation for the final thrusts. 
The last two weeks have been 
spent in seeing who can laugh the 
loudest at the so-called professional 
humor. Students have been seen 
in secret conferences behind the 
professors desks. All of which 
means that a little handshaking is 
taking place as the student hopes 
for an exemption. Ask Lutch! 
Even during time for reviews, the 
professors heap advance assign
ments, despite the fact that their 
exam might fall on the morning 
of the first day. All in all, it 
looks as though were going to 
have lots of fun.

Random shots and random 
thoughts. Our idea of the worlds 
most pathetic figure is the fellow 
who broadcasts over WCAE or 
an}- other station, when Amos 'nd 
Andy arc on KDKA. According 
to the current newspapers, Car
negie Tech is a real abiding place 
for modern Venuscs. Maybe were 
wrong! Did any of you sec Pansy 
Murdoch and his smoothy outfit 
last week? We have been accuscd 
of using this column to direct pub
licity in the general direction of 
our fraternity brothers. Jim Corri
gan, a member of SIGMA ALPHA 
EPSILON, and president of the 
Sophomore Industries class, and 
Sam Kabakov of the BETA SIGMA 
RHO, and a member of the school 
cut-ups, the .Senior Builders, are 
the accusers. Dot Yingling wants 
to sec her name in print, so now 
she can have something to write 
home about. We had the honor 
of sitting beside George Vermin 
Becker in Industrial Management 
the other day. The King has taken 
up golf. The phlegmatic Kambach, 
captain of the tennis team, is still 
a bachclor, but we hear he is 
going Booby Hatch. The ICingfish 
and his Battle-axe were taking pic
tures of dear old Alpha Chi Alpha 
in front of M. M. C. C. last Thursday.
Doug Seeley and his beaver. The 
Prince is now the Kings good man 
Friday. Commander Boyle of the 
soon-to-be Junior Prom tells us 
that A1 Katz arid his Kittens will 
play for us now. Looks like the 
Prom should be one great MEOW 
now ^rMiller, the gentleman who is in charge of Ye Oldc Grille, 
has ordered the girls to cut down 
on the amount of ice cream given 
us for a dime. As if there werent 
enough atrocities in that place.
Cluck! Cluck!
