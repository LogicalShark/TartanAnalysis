Committee 
to review atissue speakers
by Shawn Wertz 
& Michael Fitzgerald
Junior Staffwriters
On September 14, Carnegie 
Mellon President Jared L. Cohon 
released a public statement an
nouncing a new committee to re
view CMUs controversial speaker 
policy. Cohons statement came 
nearly seven months after propos
als of such a committee were orig
inally brought to Student Senate.
The appointment was made in 
response to three guest lecturers 
who spoke on campus last semes
ter. The committee will be charged 
with reviewing and possibly revis
ing the current policy, which is 
presently a three-page document 
outlining CMUs treatment of 
visiting controversial speakers.
According to Cohons state
ment, As a campus community, 
we are committed to open en
gagement, even to the extent of 
allowing offensive or troubling 
speech. At the same time, we have 
a tradition of personal respect and 
decency that can be tested by such 
unrestricted discourse.
It is that tradition that was 
tested earlier this year when the 
leader of the New Black Panther 
Party, Malik Zulu Shabazz, gave 
what was intended to be a lec
ture on African-American history 
that was met with protest from 
a number of campus groups and 
officials.
DePaul University profes
sor Norman Finkelstein and 
Palestinian-cause speaker Ali 
Abunimah rounded out the list 
of three speakers whose lectures 
allegedly included anti-Semitic 
material.
It was this material that 
prompted Hillel, along with other 
campus organizations, to gather 
on the night of the Shabazz lecture. 
Though Aaron Weil, executive di
rector of the Edward and Rose 
Berman Hillel Jewish University 
Center, would not make an offi
cial comment regarding the peace 
gathering, he did say in regard to 
the committees appointment that 
we appreciate and respect the 
Universitys decisions, and what
ever decisions theyre coming to,
 theyre keeping the students best 
interests in mind. Weil added, 
While the speakers brought mes
sages of hate, nobody should mis
construe that with the Universitys 
true intention, which is to provide 
an open and safe forum for all 
thought.
However, Weil also said, The 
position of our students has been, 
and remains to be, that while the 
Constitution guarantees the right 
of free speech, it does not guaran
tee right of venue, and thats why 
we believe those speakers were 
inappropriate.

Murphy 
unveils new 
city budget
by Greg Hanneman
Junior Staffwriter
Calling it balanced but darn 
tough, Pittsburgh Mayor Tom 
Murphy unveiled his draft of the 
citys 2006 budget Thursday.
Murphys proposal calls for 
$415.2 million in operating 
expenses  about $15 million 
less than the city was projected to 
spend next year under a five-year 
plan passed in December 2004
 and an additional $44.5 million 
in capital spending.
The uncertainty of gaming 
revenues, higher than anticipated 
health care costs, out of control 
gasoline prices, and the with
drawal of the school board from an 
agreement to pay half the cost of 
school crossing guards has forced 
the city to budget conservatively 
for 2006, Murphy said in a city 
press release Thursday.
The five-year plan was based on 
the expectation that $3.8 million in 
revenue from slot machine casinos 
would be available to the city, said 
Finance and Budget Committee 
chairman Doug Shields. But as of 
now, he noted, a casino license 
hasnt even been sold.
Without being able to count on 
the gaming money, Murphy was 
forced to cut $4 million from staff
ing appropriations. We have al
ready been forced to reduce our 
staffing levels beyond what I deem 
prudent, but city departments will 
be required to continue to do more 
with less for the foreseeable fu
ture, Murphy said.
Other cuts include $8.75 million 
from the Fire Bureau, a reduction 
in the number of city pools from 
14 to 12, and payment of crossingguard salaries only through June, 
the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette re
ported Friday.
They dont have much freedom, 
commented Robert P. Strauss, a 
professor of economics and public 
policy in CMUs Heinz School of 
Public Policy and Management. 
Theyre down to bare-bones ser
vices.

CMU may receive funding 
for displaced students
by Brittany McCandless
Assistant News Editor
Carnegie Mellon may receive 
$26,000 in federal funding if 
Congress passes an education 
bill regarding federal aid for 
students displaced by Hurricane 
Katrina.
The Department of Education 
has proposed a bill now pending 
in Congress to allocate $227 mil
lion in federal money to aid stu
dents affected by Katrina. The 
money would also go to colleges 
that have taken in displaced 
students. According to The 
Chronicle of Higher Education, 
the features of the plan include 
providing payments of $1000 to 
colleges for every student they 
take in who has.been displaced 
by Katrina.
According to the Chronicle, the 
funds would go toward helping 
colleges meet the unexpected 
costs associated with educating 
the transfer students.
If this bill passes, Carnegie 
Mellon will receive $26,000, or 
$1000 for each of the 26 dis
placed students from Tulane 
University, the University of New 
Orleans, and Loyola University. 
Contributions [for accommo
dating the students] have ex
ceeded that, said Director of
Enrollment Services Linda 
Anderson.
According to Anderson, 
Carnegie Mellon is not charging 
the displaced students tuition. 
However, those living on cam
pus are paying room and board.
Mark Carpenter, Press 
Secretary for Congressman 
Tim Murphy (R-Mt. Lebanon), 
said he expects this bill to 
pass, considering its status as a 
Department of Education pro
posal.
Under this bill, funds would 
not be allocated to the hurricanebattered colleges themselves to 
repair facilities or equipment, 
but the bill would permit the 
institutions to retain student aid 
they have already received for 
the school year. Some colleges 
have protested the lack of direct 
funding for facilities.
Its the infrastructure in the 
city thats impacting them most. 
Its going to take time to assess 
the damage, said Anderson. 
How do you expedite the whole 
process?
As of now, one education bill 
(S. 1715) calls for Congress to 
distribute $3.7 billion to ele
mentary and secondary schools 
and school districts in Katrinastricken areas, but it provides no

Asian food, music, and dancing 
make up the Mid-Autumn Festival
by Joannie Carlson
Junior Staffwriter
Last Friday, students from the 
Singapore Student Association 
(SSA) and Awareness of Roots 
in Chinese Culture (ARCC) 
held a Mid-Autumn Festival, 
also known as the Full Moon 
Festival, which falls on the 
15th day of the eighth lunar 
month. During this time, begin
ning in August and ending in 
September, the moons orbit is 
at the lowest angle to the ho
rizon. Often referred to as the 
Harvest or Hunters Moon in 
the West, it marks the middle 
of autumn with respect to the 
lunar calendar.
This festival and the Chinese 
Lunar New Year are the two 
most important holidays in the 
Chinese calendar.
As lanterns designed to re
semble the moon hung from 
the walls, the audience was 
entertained with songs about 
family coming home, martial 
arts demonstrations, and a lion 
dance that, according to Jing 
Jin  the emcee of the event  
represented a person trying to 
see if the lion is awake and then 
interacting with the animal.

Tom Jones can tell you 
whether that hat youre wear
ing to the frat party tonight 
is the latest style. No, hes 
not the fashion editor of the 
Post-Gazette  hes the pan
handler stationed across the 
street from Saks Fifth Avenue in 
downtown Pittsburgh.
Jones wishes he didnt have to 
be there. Soon, the Pittsburgh 
City Council may make that 
dream a reality  though
perhaps not in the way Jones 
would like.
The Pittsburgh City 
Council held a public hear
ing on September 20 regard
ing Bill 1617, a bill that would 
severely restrict, all city pan
handlers and solicitors. Their 
meeting was the second step in 
clearing the bill. City Council 
first ordered local associa
tions like the American Civil 
Liberties Union (ACLU), the 
district attorneys office, and 
the Pittsburgh police force to 
. compromise over the bill before 
opening it to the public.
The bill would place limita
tions on locations where pan
handlers can solicit pocket 
change. It would prohibit pan
handlers from operating outside 
the hours of 6 am to 8 pm (9 am 
to 7 pm for Daylight Savings 
Time). The bill would also re
strict solicitation within 25 feet 
of an outdoor caf and 10 feet 
from any ATM machine.
Local business leaders were 
on hand to show support for the 
bill, voicing their worries that 
visitors are leaving Pittsburgh 
with bad impressions and vow
ing never to return.
Bruce Kraus, president of 
the Southside Chamber of 
Commerce, backed the bill, say
ing that panhandling is threat
ening the security and privacy 
of all citizens on city streets. 
According to Kraus, the panhan
dlers have targeted the more 
vulnerable, such as senior citi
zens and unsuspecting college 
students. The rate of panhan
dling has risen fourfold since the 
beginning of the fall semester at 
local universities, especially in 
the Oakland area. A number

Elizabeth Anderson focuses on integration Oct. 6
by Michael M. Whiston
Junior Staffwriter
How does one deal with di
versity? This is a question that 
applies to the world at large. 
Racial integration has been a 
significant research topic of 
Elizabeth S. Anderson, profes
sor of philosophy and womens 
studies at the University of 
Michigan. Anderson makes it 
clear that segregation contin
ues to produce inequality on a 
global basis  a dilemma solv
able by integration alone.
Anderson will be presenting 
her lecture, The Imperative of 
Racial Integration, as part of 
the LaPaglia Lecture Series on 
October 6 at 4:30 PM in Baker 
Hall 136A (Adamson Wing). A 
major issue she will be addressThe Imperative of 
Racial Integration"
Thursday, October 6, 
at 4:30 pmI MRBH 136A (Adamson
__:
ing is affirmative action, which, 
in Andersons mind, is a way of 
looking to the future.
Anderson presents this view 
in contrast to the compensatory 
notion, or the perspective that
affirmative actions purpose is 
to compensate for the historical 
suffering of African-Americans 
and Latino Americans. She 
believes that the true impor
tance of affirmative action is its 
placement of minority group 
members in higher education 
and other areas, an especially 
important measure in a society 
whose highest socio-economic 
positions (i.e., corporate and 
managerial) are headed mostly 
by white Americans.
As Alex London, a profes
sor of philosophy at Carnegie 
Mellon, points out, as time 
progresses, we become more 
detached from such signs of in
equality as the Jim Crow laws 
and need fresh reminders of the 
inequality that still exists in the 
United States. You cant have a 
photograph of it, says London
of racial and socio-economic 
differences.
Anderson also wishes to dis
tinguish herself from the multiculturalist view that racial 
problems result from cultural 
difference. Rather, Anderson 
points out that racial problems 
are a result of segregation, not 
cultural difference. Segrega
tion and integration are world
wide issues, ranging from the 
integration of minorities in the 
European Union to that of Mus
lims in India.
College certainly plays a role 
in addressing this concern, says 
Anderson, as college is a piv
otal stage in character develop
ment.
Anderson says that College 
is the place where people learn 
to create cross-cutting identi
ties. She goes on to say that
It is for millions of Americans 
when they first experience ... 
real ethnic mixing. Once stu
dents become more aware, 
they can become more active. 
Students are the engine for in
tegration, and integration de
pends upon their reaching out, 
says Anderson.
Andersons topics are eclec
tic, ranging from animal rights 
to economic value to democ
racy. At the focus of most of 
her research are the ideas of 
justice and parity in the U.S. In 
her forthcoming publication, 
Racial Integration as a Com
pelling Interest, she looks at 
court cases dealing with deseg
regation and how they relate to 
affirmative action.
London says that this should 
be a thought-provoking lecture 
... the way a lecture should be.

Unable to hit their target numbers, 
military recruiters are finding new 
ways and new populations to recruit. 
Their efforts, though, are becoming 
more and more invasive. Some groups
 including a number of universities
 are beginning to take up the fight 
and push back. At the heart of this mat
ter is a single piece of legislation.
In 1994, Congress passed the Solo
mon Amendment, which allows the 
Secretary of Defense to refuse federal 
grants to colleges and universities that 
prohibit or prevent ROTC or military 
recruitment on campus. The policy ef
fectively gives free range to the armed 
forces.
Only if students actively request and 
complete an opt-out form can they 
escape the database. I think its safe to 
say from the junk in my mailbox that I 
missed the deadline.
The Solomon Amendment has come 
into play in two particular conflicts: one 
dealing with the collection of student 
information for a national database, 
and the other regarding the militarys 
response to universities anti-discrimi
nation policies.
In May, the Department of Defense 
announced that it was beginning to 
collect the personal information of all 
college students and high school stu
dents from 16 to 18 years in age. What 
is most disconcerting is that the data
base will be available to those who re
quire the records in the performance of 
their official duties. Privacy advocates 
are rightly up in arms.
Colleges, including Carnegie 
Mellon, have the right to adopt privacy 
policies that prevent outside entities 
from obtaining a students directory 
information, which may include in
formation like a students name and 
address, but also a photograph and 
academic information. But the De
partment of Defense has made its way 
around colleges efforts to protect their 
students privacy.
Student privacy is pushed to the 
side, however, in the debate over the 
Solomon Amendment.
A number of the nations top law 
schools had banned military recruiters 
from using the schools career center 
resources to recruit students, argu
ing that the Department of Defenses 
dont ask, dont tell policy violated 
their non-discrimination policies. 
Again, the armed forces invoked the 
Solomon Amendment, threatening to 
yank millions in funding from Harvard, 
Yale, and other schools.
The Forum for Academic and Insti
tutional Rights (FAIR), an organiza
tion of 30 universities, sued the gov
ernment, submitting that the law is 
unconstitutional in that it violates the 
universities First Amendment rights. 
They argue that the law unjustly forces 
them to spread the militarys discrimi
natory message inherent in the dont 
ask, dont tell policy.
Our own university takes an inter
esting position. The Universitys State
ment of Assurance specifically ad
dresses the matter: [I]n the judgment 
of the Carnegie Mellon Human Rela
tions Commission, the Presidential 
Executive Order directing the Depart
ment of Defense to follow a policy of 
Dont ask, dont tell, dont pursue ex
cludes openly gay, lesbian and bisexual 
students from receiving ROTC scholar
ships or serving in the military. Never
theless, all ROTC classes at Carnegie 
Mellon University are available to all 
students. Opening ROTC classes to all 
students is nice, but in the long run it 
serves little purpose. It does not defend 
GLBT students who might otherwise 
apply for scholarships.
So far, the conflict has been limited 
to law schools, but this is an issue that 
affects all of higher education. The Su
preme Court will hear FAIRS lawsuit 
against the government in December. 
Numerous parties have filed friend-ofthe-court briefs supporting FAIR, but 
in light of the multiple instances where 
the Solomon Amendment has intruded 
in the privacy and freedom of higher 
education, it is time for CMU and other 
universities to take a more active role 
in defending their students rights.

PANHANDLING, from Al
of panhandlers are located 
on Forbes Avenue near the 
University of Pittsburgh and 
on Craig Street. If the 25-foot 
rule was enforced, they would 
not be able to remain in these 
areas, which have a high con
centration of restaurants with 
outdoor seating.
Barb Feige, associate direc
tor of the Pittsburgh chapter 
of the ACLU, has campaigned 
to make the panhandling 
bill less harsh on the citys 
solicitors. She deemed the 
time restriction unconstitu
tional, explaining, There is 
no Cinderella clause in the 
First Amendment.
The ACLU successfully 
modified the bill to allow pan
handling within 25 feet of an 
outdoor cafe, down from the 
original 50 feet.
Feige cited the negative 
effects the bill has on other 
solicitors, such as the tradi
tional Salvation Army bucketeers. Staring pointedly at 
the council, Feige challenged, 
Youre allowed to ask for a 
vote; folks should be allowed 
to ask for money.
The meeting agenda did 
not only include the opinions 
of Pittsburgh business repre
sentatives, but incorporated 
other voices as well. Nick 
Horazzi, a Pittsburgh citizen, 
spoke passionately on the 
positive repercussions the bill 
would have on his everyday 
life.
Saying that he is tired of 
sweeping excrement and 
vomit out of alleyways, 
Horazzi believes the bill will 
help combat the fact that the 
government has made it easy 
to be irresponsible.
Other community speak
ers shared stories of fraudu
lent panhandlers, such as a 
woman on Grant Street who 
was stricken with a fatal 
brain tumor that was sup
posed to have killed her three 
years ago.

this goal, the organization aims to 
educate the community on pov
erty and fundraise for projects all 
around the world. Carnegie Mellon 
Habitat recently donated $5000 to 
build a house in Cambodia, which 
went above and beyond the annual 
tithes to international projects 
that are required of all Habitat 
chapters.
With their East Liberty project 
project complete, Habitat is now 
fleshing out plans for their next 
house. Fundraising has already be
gun on a home to be built in the 
Pittsburgh borough of Etna, an area 
damaged by flooding last year. The 
club hopes to raise the necessary 
funds for the Etna house in two 
years.
Though its fundraising is geared
Students worked last spring to construct wall frames, which are now part of three new homes in the neighborhood of 
East Liberty. Habitat for Humanity raised $85,000 over several years to go towards the houses.
Shields said these restraints 
were relaxed, for reasons un
known, after Murphy took of
fice.
The debt service is why the 
city is on the verge of bank
ruptcy, Strauss said. You 
dont have public services; 
you have debt services.
In 2002, 16 percent of 
Pittsburghs budget went to 
debt payments. The following 
year the proportion increased 
to 22 percent, and had fur
ther climbed to 23 percent 
for the current years budget. 
In testimony prepared for a 
2003 state Senate hearing on 
Pittsburghs financial situa
tion, Strauss said this figure 
should remain under 10 per
cent, and is as low as 5 per
cent in some of Pittsburghs 
suburbs.
Though the mayors pro
posal is balanced, projecting 
$416.4 million of revenue 
against $415.2 million of 
spending, Shields cautioned 
against putting faith in that 
terminology because revenue 
must be estimated before it is 
actually collected.
A balanced budget is sim
ply a best guess, he said. All 
a balanced budget means is 
that the numbers on one side 
of the ledger add up to the 
numbers on the other side.
Now the proposal must 
now be reviewed by both 
the Intergovernmental 
Cooperation Authority (ICA) 
and the Act 47 coordinator, 
two state entities that oversee 
the citys finances.
The ICA is scheduled to 
meet with Murphy tomorrow, 
and a final budget must be in 
place by December 31.

the back. The event was really for 
friends, said Zimmerman.
The two other houses in the 
dedication were paid for and built 
by partner Habitat chapters from 
University of Pittsburgh and the 
City of Pittsburgh. CMUs group, 
which is relatively new, has been 
working with these groups recently 
in an effort to forge close bonds 
with the many Habitat chapters in 
and around the CMU community.
Though Habitat is most famous 
for home-building, the groups state
ment of purpose on cmhabitat.org 
says that is just part of the clubs 
greater goal of eliminating poverty 
housing both in the Pittsburgh area 
and around the world. To achieve
primarily toward its building proj
ects, the group plans to donate 30 
percent of all collections to rebuild 
houses in Louisiana and Mississippi 
that were damaged by Hurricane 
Katrina.
According to Zimmerman, the 
hard labor of building homes is 
worth it. As an architecture major, 
she says the chance to construct a 
real home gives an inkling of the 
future.
Habitat will soon be out on the 
Cut again, building more house 
frames. All members of the com
munity are invited to join them in 
their work.

Mellon Habitat for Humanity, visit

BUDGET, from Al
Both Shields and Strauss 
said that mandatory debt pay
ments amounting to around 
$100 million annually, or 
nearly a quarter of the to
tal budget, have tightened 
Pittsburghs finances in recent 
years.
Pittsburgh got into trou
ble because it didnt manage 
its debt and live within its 
means, Shields said.
Shields said that Pitts
burghs last three mayoral ad
ministrations invested heavily 
in real estate development in 
the hopes of increasing prop
erty tax revenues, but returns 
were much smaller than ex
pected. Previous administra
tions implemented commen
surate restrictions in spending

Cohon creates 
speakers 
committee
COMMITTEE, from Al
The committee now has the task of 
deciding whether or not the negative 
response to last semesters speakers 
can be prevented from recurring with 
a revised policy.
Its not so much the type of speaker, 
its how each speaker will be han
dled, commented Nicholas Scocozzo, 
the Student Body Vice-President for 
Finance and member of the new com
mittee. Its not just about looking over 
the policy, but also how the policy will 
be enforced.
With schools such as Shippensburg 
University (Pa.) and the University of 
Minnesota currently under pressure 
from federal courts to revise their free 
speech policies and further accommo
date the First Amendment rights of 
college students, the committee in
tends to make sure free speech is not 
violated.
CMU professor of architecture and 
committee member Omer Akin insists, 
We will make sure no freedoms are 
curtailed, but having unlimited free
dom can be [problematic], for some 
may infringe on the freedoms of oth
ers.
Akin stated, The public should know 
that we are reviewing the policy, which 
is routine. But he also acknowledged 
the role the three speakers had in 
the committees appointment. If you 
dont have fresh data to inform your 
policy, he said, you cannot make in
formed changes.
One committee member claimed 
that he would need to check his First 
Amendment rights on the issue before 
commenting on any possible decisions 
the committee will be making.
Akin does not expect any changes in 
the policy, adding, I wouldnt neces
sarily say we have to change anything, 
but referencing the circumstances sur
rounding the three speakers from last 
semester, a three-page document 
wont do everything.
If any changes are made to the cur
rent policy, they will not take effect 
until spring, as Cohon gave the com
mittee the entire semester to make 
corrections. Well be getting different 
peoples input throughout the semes
ter, Scocozzo added. Were trying to 
please everyone as much as possible.
Share your space, but live on your own.

How Things Work: Laughter
Science Technology
26 September 2005 THE TARTAN A6
Sheila Prakash
Laughing is hard work. Its so hard, in fact, 
that the Encyclopaedia Britannica defines it, 
not as a procession of hoots and hollers, but 
as a series of rhythmic, vocalized, expiratory 
and involuntary actions, all designed to help 
you giggle at this article sometime before 
Easter 2006. While common perception may 
lead you to believe that the difficult job of 
inciting laughter belongs to a comedian, your 
brain says that common perception is patently 
incorrect.
In addition to being responsible for vision, 
memory, movement, and all around existence, 
your brain  particularly the left cortical 
region of itis constantly parsing the external 
vocal stimuli it receives for absurdities. Once a 
logic error is detected and someones speech 
is veering down a path of potential hilarity, 
the right hemisphere of the brain takes apart 
the sentence and starts diagnosing its humor.
Thus, one hemisphere receives the joke 
while the other tries to actively get it.
While the right hemisphere is tackling 
syntax, the frontal lobe of the brain begins 
preparing for an upcoming change in your 
overall emotional climate. By this time, brain 
activity has spread from the right hemisphere 
to the sensory processing area of the occipital 
lobe, where motor signals will eventually 
be stimulated in time for you to spit out a 
chuckle.
The work is hardly complete, however. 
Regardless of how anticlimactic and fake your 
future chuckle is, fifteen muscles in your face 
still have the task of contracting and raising 
the zygmotic major muscle controlling your 
upper lip. Further, your forthcoming laugh will 
throw your epiglottis over half of your larynx, 
sending you into a fit of wheezing and gasping 
that only annoys your respiratory system.

Banana extinction might 
be imminent
Americans consume more bananas 
than any other kind of fruit. The 
Cavendish banana  the kind available 
in supermarkets  is produced and 
sold worldwide. However, its flaw lies 
in the strains genetic uniformity: Each 
Cavendish is a twin of the last. While 
this lends a nice consistency at the 
breakfast table, the genome is no longer 
diverse enough to resist infection. Fungi 
or bacteria that attack one banana will 
affect an entire plantation. This did in 
fact happen, 50 years, ago when the 
Gros Michel banana, reputed to be 
larger and tastier than the Cavendish, 
was wiped out by a fungus called the 
Panama disease. An infection in the 
Cavendish variety could easily spread 
across the globe in as few as five years, 
scientists say.

Pleas for human organs 
pervade Internet
Patients in need of organ transplants 
are taking matters into their own hands 
and, with the far-reaching influence of 
the Internet, are seeking compatible 
persons to donate a kidney or a liver 
to save their lives. The implications 
are twofold. On one hand, a broader 
audience means more possibilities for 
a matching volunteer; more lives may 
be saved. On the other hand, skeptics 
fear that unscrupulous deals and 
organ trafficking will increase; lives 
may be saved at others expense. The 
Web has suddenly created much wider 
access, which in some ways is great, 
said Jeffrey P. Kahn, a University of 
Minnesota bioethicist. But we need to 
create access in a way that is equitable 
and doesnt lead to people being 
disadvantaged or exploited.

Swearing is hardwired 
into humans
Cursing seems to be a human 
constant. Researchers who study 
language evolution and the psychology 
of swearing have found that every 
language, dialect, and group of people 
has its own taboo lexicon. In fact, 
studying strong language may provide 
clues to the links between higher 
and bestial brain functions. Physical 
responses to curses include spiked 
skin conductance patterns, rising arm 
hair, quickening pulse, and shallow 
breathing. Apparently, hearing those 
four-letter words will literally get a 
rise out of the listener.

How would you like to be a cy

the cyber-world from cyber-villains such as MC Spammer and 
Elvirus? If youd like to take the 
challenge, as many elementary 
school children in Pittsburgh 
have, youre not too far away.
My Secure Cyberspace is 
a project created jointiy by 
Carnegie Mellon Universitys 
CyLab and the Information Net
working Institute (INI), and its 
letting people do just that.
Whats different about MySecureCyberspace is that it 
gives users customized informa
tion about what they could en
counter online at any time, INI 
Director Dena Haritos Tsamitis 
told INI News. Tsamitis is part 
of the Department of Homeland 
Security (DHS) Task Force for 
Information Security Educa
tion and Awareness. Tsamitis 
founded MySecureCyberspace 
when she realized the dearth of 
public information on personal 
computer security.
Now the public can eas
ily learn about computer secu
rity on MySecureCyberspace. 
Adults can create accounts that 
provide information on how 
to maintain computer security 
while filesharing, Web surfing, 
instant messaging, e-shopping, 
and more.
Kids scores points for being 
educational and a lot of fun. The 
site offers interactive, cartoon 
games that will teach children 
how to stay safe while using the 
internet. The goal of the MySe
cureCyberspace for Kids web
site, the CySec Project website 
states, is to educate kids about 
cybersecurity and instill in them 
good cybercitizen habits so that 
being safe and secure online 
becomes as second nature as 
brushing your teeth.
As both the villains and the 
heroes are well developed, the 
game easily charms children. 
My eight-year-old is my per
fect test case. She does things 
[online] that totally blow my 
mind, Tsamitis said on how 
MySecureCyberspace for Kids 
has already served as an edu
cational tool in her own home. 
Her children have contributed 
to some of the games appear
ance and features.
The game looks like a fun fu
sion of Kim Possible, TheJetsons, 
Danny Phantom, and Dexters

ports to a Cyber Commander, 
who is in charge of the Cyber 
Defense Academy. The Cyber

lish and the second language 
requested  as well as the writ
ing systems for each. In a case 
involving colloquial Arabic, a 
writing system had to be in
vented, requiring almost half a 
year of hard work.
What follows is a tour of the 
most exciting projects currendy 
underway at the InterACT cen
ter, based on several personal 
interviews with Tanja Schultz, 
one of the centers principal re
searchers.
The TansTac Project
Four weeks ago, DARPA se
lected InterACTs Two-Way 
Speech Translation System as 
one of three finalists in their 
search for a device to provide a 
better speech translation system 
for the U.S. military.
At the beginning of this sum
mer, DARPA issued a chal
lenge to InterACT: Could
they build a two-way speech 
translator between Iraqi Ara
bic and English in only 100 
days? The military had an urgent 
need for Iraqi translators, and 
they wanted to get this into 
the field ASAP. InterACT ac
cepted the challenge, but 
soon ran into trouble. The 
100 days were ticking away, and 
they still had no data.
The translation texts and ac
companying audio between 
Iraqi Arabic and English 
were taking forever to build, 
since there was no writing 
system for Iraqi-Arabic. When 
the data finally arrived, it 
was August 2: only 23 days 
before the deadline. Along 
with several other CMU re-' 
lated spin-offs, InterACTs 
7-member team immediately 
went to work.
Despite time and data limi
tations, though, InterACTs 
device performed so well at 
the evaluation that the team 
was flown down to Fort Huachuca, Ariz., for a final, compre
hensive evaluation.
InterACT used VoxTecs Phraselator, a ruggedized PDA, as 
hardware.
Schultz gave The Tartan 
the opportunity to test the re
sult, something she called the 
Speechalator.
I activated the microphone 
and said Hello; the PDA 
thought for a few seconds, and 
then loudly announced: Marhaba. Theoretically, an Iraqi 
would then respond in Arabic,
and his words would be pro
claimed aloud in English. I 
tried it, and Marhaba came 
back as Hello. Next I tried 
the nonsense phrase con
servative voices were sing
ing, which was returned as 
converse voices were sign 
making. But the device was 
designed for force protec
tion, and phrases like hands 
up and get out of the car 
were perfectly recognized.
Although it is uncertain 
whether InterACTs software 
will ultimately be deployed 
to Iraq, there is no question 
that the center is one of very 
few institutions that are able 
to produce such a device.
The SPICE Project
Schultz was eager to tell 
The Tartan about her baby, 
a speech-processing project 
called SPICE whose goal is to 
produce an Interactive Cre
ation and Evaluation toolkit 
for new languages. Those 
who know English and an
other language can create 
their own speech recogni
tion and translation system 
with the SPICE software.
Schultz explained that 
the program will bridge 
the gap between technology 
expertise and language ex
pertise. It takes about half 
a year for a human to build 
a basic language database, 
and with so many languages 
in the world, InterACT could 
be forced to spend the ma
jority of their time building 
these databases. SPICE asks 
for public to help to solve 
the problem by contributing 
to a new public-domain of 
language databases. So far, 
she has had three visiting 
researchers use the system 
to build the first-ever speech 
recognition and translation 
systems in Afrikaans, Viet
namese, and Bulgarian.
The Dolphin Project
Are dolphins as intelligent 
as we are? InterACT is trying 
to find out. In collaboration 
with the Wild Dolphin Proj
ect and the Naval Research 
Center, Schultz and her 
CMU colleagues Alan Black 
and Robert Frederking are 
working on a project for the

A British doctor helping tsu
nami victims in Thailand wants 
to give advice to a patient. In the 
past, hed tout along a transla
tor; but today, he speaks into his

A soldier in Iraq needs to 
talk to the local warlord, who 
doesnt speak a word of Eng
lish. He issues his statement into 
a box in his hand, and it repeats 
to the Iraqi in Arabic. He re
sponds in Arabic, and his words 
are likewise translated into Eng
lish.
Sound fantastic? Not any
more. The recently birthed International Center for Advanced 
Communication Technologies 
(InterACT) jointly hosted by 
the Language Technologies In
stitute, Carnegie Mellon, and 
the Fakultt fr Informatik, 
Universitt (TH), in Karlsruhe, 
Germany, is a facility devoted 
entirely to multimodal human 
and human-machine communi
cation.
How It Works
InterACTs goal is to create 
a comprehensive software sys
tem that can translate audible 
speech between any two lan
guages. This extraordinary task 
breaks down into three parts: 
transforming what people say 
into text (automatic speech recognition), translating this text 
into another language (machine 
translation), and synthesiz
ing translated text into audible 
sound (speech synthesis).
Primary analysis is acoustic: 
The computer recognizes the. 
sound of unique phonemes, or 
syllables. Secondary analysis is 
vocabulary: The computer com
bines phonemes and integrates 
them into words. Final analysis 
is language: The computer looks 
at three-word trigrams to 
check for logical consistency.
Once the system can rec
ognize sentences, it must be 
trained to recognize actual 
speech. Linguists spend many 
hours transcribing speech into 
text. And that requires someone 
who is familiar with both Eng---------------------------------------------------

Xbox 360 bursts onto to campus
by Evan Sundwick
Production Manager
It takes a special occurrence 
to fill Wean 7500 auditorium be
yond seating capacity and into 
the range of a fire hazard.
But when Microsoft came 
to campus on Tuesday night, it 
brought in crowds that could 
barely fit in the auditorium. 
Some came for the free pizza and 
soda; others came to flaunt their 
resumes in hopes of being hired 
by one of the most prominent 
tech companies in the world. 
Most, though, came for a sneak 
peak of Microsofts upcoming 
next-generation game console, 
the Xbox 360.
The first part of the event was 
a standard Microsoft recruitment 
seminar. Everyone was silent, 
waiting patiently for the meat of 
the show: the Xbox 360, going 
on sale November 22 and aimed 
directly at Sonys upcoming Play
Station 3.
The eyes of half the auditorium

with a giant neon-green logo. It

phone call, so as to avoid dis
turbing everyone else? Inter
ACTs Non-Audible Speech 
Recognition solves this by 
recognizing speech based on 
face muscles, and not on any 
audible sound.
A set of electrodes is placed 
on the subjects face, and the 
resulting myoelectric sig
nals from the articulatory 
face muscles are analyzed, 
training the computer to cor
relate motion with words. 
Schultz demonstrated a test of 
the system, a phone conversa
tion between a normal party 
and one who spoke inaudibly. 
As the subject mouthed the 
words, the computer imme
diately recognized them and 
spoke into the phone. It was 
as if the other party was talk
ing to Valerie the Robot.
Amazingly, the Non-Au
dible Speech Recognition 
project is merely a master 
thesis.
One day Schultz and her 
grad students may finally de
velop a machine capable of 
virtually instantaneous trans
lation between all languages. 
But is that a good thing? No
body wants to talk to a box, 
and one wonders if this could 
ultimately result in less com
munication.
Schultz disagrees: Some 
day, the box will disappear 
from our sight  it will do its 
magic in the background  
and we can just concentrate 
on communicating with the 
human in front of us.
Her work is of great impor
tance to those who need to 
communicate right now. And 
the doctors in Thailand are 
grateful.

Since dolphins communicate 
at frequencies up to ten times the 
audible limit of the normal human 
ear, the InterACT group needed 
to first build special microphones 
and computers.
The next step was to record 
the dolphin sounds. Last year 
Frederking spent 10 days on a 
boat in the Bahamas swimming 
with dolphins and collecting data. 
Schultzs team then worked on 
deconstructing dolphin whistles 
into what she calls dolphones. 
Although the project is still in 
an early stage of development, 
Schultz and her collaborators 
have already built and tested a 
software package that takes the 
signature whistle of a dolphin as 
input and outputs the identity of 
a dolphin. With this system, the
members of the Wild Dolphin 
Project could identify dolphins 
near their boats in open ocean 
without actually seeing them.
Schultz hopes to eventually 
be able to work with marine bi

various dolphin sounds mean. 
Perhaps one day we will be able 
to speak dolphinish.

Laughter from the bottom of your brain
LAUGHTER, fromA6
Clearly, 'laughter is an 
underrated but sophisticated 
process. But before the left 
hemisphere can initiate the 
signal cascade that results in 
your big guffaw, your brain 
must be able to distinguish 
things that are humorous 
from things that are irrational, 
depressing, or downright 
stupid. Researchers studying 
the physiology of laughter, a 
field referred to as gelotology, 
have determined that laughter is 
usually triggered in three ways.
In most instances, people 
laugh when a mundane story 
or event has a surprising or 
unexpected outcome. Our brains 
anticipate one reaction but are 
caught off guard and forced to
provide another reaction. The 
result of this awkward neuronal 
stumbling is our eloquent
laughter.
In addition to incongruity 
theory, gelotologists have found 
that much of our laughter is 
brought about by witnessing 
someone elses idiocy. The
superiority theory maintains 
that the sight of anothers
downfall provides us with a 
sense of superiority that allows 
us to detach ourselves from the 
situation and, consequently,
laugh at it.
The third way to initiate 
laughter is called relief theory. 
Obsessively employed by sitcoms 
writers and moviemakers alike, 
this method involves building up 
a tense situation only to deflate it 
moments later with comic relief.
According to specialists, laughter 
in these situations allows 
us to cleanse our system of 
built-up tension and incongruity, 
leveling the playing field
and allowing the director to 
increase the tension and drama 
once again.
Although laughter is usually 
the result of one of these 
theories, it is possible to elicit 
laughter by using all three
methods at once. This raises hell 
all around.
Regardless, the next time you 
snicker at something, take a 
minute and reflect. Realise that 
your chuckle has successfully 
fried your brain, exhausted your
muscles, and harassed your
respiratory system. The very 
idea might just be worth another 
laugh.

Washing hands: Not just for employees anymore
Heres some good advice for the TOC/ 
BOC: when you meet a recruiter, be sure 
to greet him or her with a good, firm 
handshake  not the flu.
This should seem like common sense, 
but so often we overlook obvious things 
that could prevent us from spreading 
germs and illness. Every day, people 
blow their noses, pet strange dogs, touch 
banisters, keyboards, and doorknobs, 
and then touch someone else without 
washing their hands. It may seem odd 
to think that something as easy as using 
a little soap and water could drastically 
reduce the number of head colds in 
the nation, but consider this: According 
to the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention (CDC), the number one way 
to prevent infections is handwashing.
Remember in kindergarten when you 
all got to take turns at the sink after
eating snack? As college students, weve 
become so caught up in academics, ac
tivities, and jobs that we can forget the 
simple lessons we were taught as chil
dren. Think about what college is: Its a 
closely packed environment where ev
eryone shares the same resources, like 
bathrooms, water fountains, kitchens, 
and dining tables. That kid down the 
hall with the sniffles will give it to his 
roommate, who will give it to his girl
friend, who will give it to her project 
partner, who will give it to the rest of 
her floor. In the case of a runny nose or 
a sore throat, getting sick is an inconve
nience, but something like mononucleo
sis or bronchitis is crippling to a busy 
student.
Still think handwashing is trivial? 
Tell that to the number of organizations 
worldwide like the Global Public-Private
Partnership for Handwashing and the 
American Society for Microbiology, who 
hosts a website named washup.org. 
Every states health department has a 
tutorial on correct handwashing. Its a 
major part of a health curriculum for 
elementary-school students, and for 
workers in the food industry or doctors, 
failing to wash their hands could have 
disastrous consequences. Take it seri
ously.
However, you shouldnt skulk around 
eyeing everyone as though theyre noth
ing more than walking vessels for dis
ease. The nice thing about handwashing 
is that its as easy as, well, rubbing your 
hands together. Just keep in mind what 
you could be getting from  and giving 
to  your neighbors.
Especially if your neighbor is your 
potential employer.
Do we need another committee?
Creation of controversial speakers committee pointless
As youve probably already heard, 
the administration has once again gone 
committee-happy. By creating the new 
committee to review the university pol
icy on controversial speakers, sparked 
by three such speakers last semester, 
University President Jared Cohon has 
created little more than a time-sink for 
the committee members and a diversion 
that will keep our community focused 
merely on symptoms of a deeper prob
lem.
While it is disturbing that the admin
istration took more than six months to 
respond to these events, perhaps even 
more disturbing is that the only sub
stantial response thus far has been yet 
another committee. How will the cam
pus community  and the student body 
in particular  be helped by having 
a dozen chosen ones sit around and 
discuss the matter? The formation and 
selection processes seem shrouded by 
bureaucracy, so how can the members of 
the campus community have faith in the 
product of this relatively surrepititious 
committee?
Also unsettling is the makeup of this 
committee; it seems that this group was 
hastily selected without much regard 
to finding either sufficient student rep
resentation or a diverse group. How 
are the student body vice-president 
and treasurer considered to be varied
enough as members of this new com
mittee? Granted, Nicolette Louissaint 
and Nick Scocozzo are two very bright 
people whom we respect, but theyre 
both seniors, have the same major, and 
are connected to the same corner of the 
campus community.
Carnegie Mellon would benefit more 
from a strong endorsement of free speech 
than it would from this token effort at 
pandering to a specific group of people. 
The policy, as it stands is clear, strong, 
and honorable: If men and women are 
to value freedom, they must experience 
it. If they are to learn to choose wisely, 
they must know what the choices are; 
and they must learn in an environment 
where no idea is unthinkable and where 
no alternative is withheld from their 
consideration.
Even more threatening than some of 
the rhetoric put forth by these contro
versial speakers was the response gener
ated by some parts of the campus com
munity; need we remind you how Ali 
Abunimahs lecture was continually in
terrupted by organized harassment from 
hecklers? Or how Norman Finkelstein 
was utterly disrespected by catcalls from 
a disruptive audience, a disgrace only 
to be capped off by a rebuttal scholar 
who just tried to discredit him?
Each of these three speakers came 
to campus so that students could learn
new viewpoints and new opinions. The 
engaged discussion that followed the 
Malik Zulu Shabazz lecture, regarding 
free speech and the rights therein, did 
far more good for the students of this 
university than the questionable con
tent of his lecture. All of the controver
sial speakers to have galvanized our 
community have brought the collegiate 
learning experience outside of the class
room.
However, let us not forget the fragil
ity of this intersection of freedom and 
responsibility, as Cohon wrote back in 
February. Students were threatened, 
feelings were hurt, and hateful state
ments were made. The continued dig
nity and respect of every member of 
the campus community toward every 
other is absolutely vital to the success of 
free speech; it is impossible for people 
to grow in an environment that does 
not nurture them and allow for free 
discourse.
The current policy on. controversial 
speakers does exacdy what it should 
do. Creating this new committee seems 
like the first step toward keeping stu
dents from making their own opinions 
about controversial speakers and topics. 
Why are we not crediting intelligent 
students with being capable of mak
ing reasonable, rational decisions about 
tendentious material?
Use new technology, not zombie dogs
I was a surprised and outraged when 
I read the editorial on zombie dogs in 
last weeks issue of The Tartan. There 
was not one word said in regard to the 
suffering and unnecessary deaths that 
so many animals are put through in 
order to complete this research. Not 
only are many animals never able to be 
brought back to life in the first place, 
but many of them that are brought back 
have serious psychological and physi
ological damage as a result of these 
experiments.
When one reads of the new research 
that is being done nowadays, one 
should keep in mind that there is no 
excuse for the unnecessary suffering 
of unconsenting animals. The life for 
laboratory animals is one of deprivation, 
isolation, and misery and there are as 
many as 115 million animals killed in 
research laboratories in America each 
year. Due to the realization by scientists 
that animals are NOT a good model
of the human body, there are many 
new technologies that have and are 
currently being developed in order for 
scientists to be able to do their research 
without the invasive use of animal 
subjects. Some labs that embrace this 
progressive way of thinking are: The 
National Cancer Institute, Pharmagene 
Laboratories in England, and Physiome 
Sciences in New Jersey.
Animal testing is currendy a hot 
topic, and The Tartan should realize 
that it is important to list both sides 
of every story. For every person that 
MIGHT be saved using this still very 
premature method, how many animals 
must die? Next time a piece of research 
is brought to awareness, the good and 
the bad aspects of it should be brought 
to light.

Potential failures of 
Palestinian leadership
Ben Hackett
During a Hamas rally this past Friday 
some of Hamas best and brightest acci
dentally blew themselves up, killing at 
least 15 people and injuring 80. These 
men were traveling in a truck full of 
explosives and weaponry.
Hamas immediately blamed the at
tack on an Israeli missile strike, but this 
has been proved entirely false. Even 
Palestinian Authority officials reported 
that weaponry and explosives carried 
in the truck accidentally detonated.
The propaganda wing of Hamas 
flew into effect, spreading the lie of an 
Israeli missile attack. Soon after, the 
Associated Press reported that militants 
fired 35 rockets into Israeli territory 
from the Gaza Strip. This is the first 
major assault since the Gaza pullout:.
Israeli response and rhetoric quickly 
followed the rocket attack. Strikes were 
launched and three weapons facilities 
in Gaza were destroyed. Israeli aircraft 
fired on militants cars, killing two. Af
terwards, Israeli officials were weigh
ing the possibility of a ground force 
action against Palestinian militants.
In addition to hoping for an end of 
the strife in the Middle East, the main 
crux of my argument for supporting 
the two-state solution has always been 
sovereign accountability and defensible 
borders. On a theoretical basis, most 
modern Jews will not argue against the 
rights of a people to have a sovereign 
nation and territory of their own. Moral 
equivalency arguments set aside, sup
porters of Israel should realize the pro
found implications of the Gaza pullout 
and subsequent settlement pullouts.
Establishing a sovereign Palestinian 
state assigns a set of responsibilities 
to the Palestinian people. With their 
main excuse for terror  the occupa
tion of the Gaza strip  removed, the 
reasoning for continued violence has 
been weakened considerably. Due to 
the nature of relations between the 
neighboring states, and responsibilities 
to the citizens of each, President Abbas 
should disarm the militant groups. This 
is in the best interest of the Palestin
ian people, as an established Palestin
ian land that continues to support the 
terror apparatus makes itself a viable 
target for a declaration of war.
Some will argue that ceding lands to 
the Palestinian people does not elimi
nate all rationale for terrorism. While
this may or may not be the case, it would 
no longer hold as a valid argument with 
an established Palestinian state. Exam
ined in the responsibilities of states in 
the international system, the state be
comes responsible for the actions of its 
citizens within. This means that Abbas 
and Co. can no longer hide behind the 
excuse of independent militant wings 
acting on their own behalf.
Israeli concessions have always 
merited violence in return. However, 
actually giving (or giving back) lands 
changes the dynamic of Israeli-Palestinian policy and interaction. Interna
tional pressure should begin to shift 
equally onto the Palestinians. Masters 
of a domain for the first time in recent 
history, the onus falls onto the Palestin
ian people to stop, or at least control, 
the violent acts of their own people.
President Abbas has failed so far. His 
failure to disarm the militant groups  
for fear of a civil war  has left his gov
ernment and his people in a vulnerable 
situation. Weapons coming through a 
porous Egyptian border, Iranian-backed 
terrorist groups setting up shop in Gaza 
and the continuation of attacks do not 
bode well for the future of Palestinian 
relations with the state of Israel.
Though I am normally weary of inter
national pressure concerning the situa
tion in Israel, once the Palestinian state 
has been established, this international 
pressure should be welcomed. With de
fensible borders and normalized state 
to state relations, Israeli policy experts 
are on sound moral footing to invite the 
international community to pressure 
Palestinian leadership into disarming 
militants.
Leadership is entirely to blame for 
the Palestinians lack of grasp on the 
gravity of the situation. Remove context 
and examine the same setup between 
two other nations. Examine a similar 
situation between India and Pakistan. 
Assume that the issue of Kashmir was 
settled, and that, following the treaty, 
Pakistani militants launched strikes on 
Indian citizens. Outside of the general 
abhorrence of war, the international 
community would not condemn a retal
iatory strike by the Indian government.
With that scenario in mind, place 
this situation in the context of an es
tablished Palestinian state. With bibli
cal claims aside in favor of progres
sive solutions to land claims, and the 
question of borders answered, citizens 
could begin to build their lives instead 
of fighting an occupying force. With

Changes 
to campus 
dining
____________________Tom Sabram
Most students at Carnegie 
Mellon University have, at one 
time or another, complained 
about the schools dining. Tim 
Michael, the former head of 
Housing Services, was chosen to 
take charge of the newly formed 
Housing and Dining Services. 
The merger of these two student 
services seemed to be inevitable, 
as most students generally view 
the two departments functioning 
as one.
Since the joining, there have 
been a number of changes to 
eating facilities on campus, in
cluding Skibo Coffeehouses re
design, the introduction of the 
create-a-block option, and the 
rearrangement of the dining gal
lery in the University Center. Tim 
has also created an amazing plan 
for the current Highlander Cafe, 
and when his plans come to frui
tion, I expect to see the renovated 
area well utilized.
As I mentioned last week, Tim 
is creating the Dining Student 
Advisory Council (DSAC). Last 
Tuesday, Tim and I sat down for 
a meeting to talk about the im
plementation of DSAC. I plan to 
speak with the Student Dormi
tory Council (SDC) in the coming 
days to gain their support.
I would like to eliminate SDCs 
Food committee along with the 
Student Body Dining Committee 
(SBDC), following Tims notion 
that having one committee will 
streamline the ways we get the 
important information of what 
the students want and need. Tim 
is willing to let SDC and me make 
appointments to DSAC. I will be 
appointing at least one graduate 
student, and Tim will appoint 
faculty and staff to compose the 
12- or 13-person committee.
I would like to see DSAC choose 
a point person to relay the infor
mation coming from committee 
meetings back to the Undergrad
uate Student Senate, Graduate 
Student Assembly, Nicolette, 
'and me. Assuming that SDC will 
embrace this idea openly, DSAC 
could start its meetings as soon 
early October.
DSAC has an amazing oppor
tunity to succeed in ways SBDC 
did three years ago. Tim will or
ganize facets of the DSAC meet
ing in hopes of making student 
involvement less of a burden and 
therefore more successful.
I encourage all students to 
talk to the DSAC representative 
(who will be announced at a 
later date), and tell them what 
changes you would like to see to 
dining on campus. If you are in
terested in being a part of DSAC, 
please send me an e-mail or come 
speak with me during my weekly 
office hours.
Tom Sabram fsbp@J can be found 
enjoying the occasional meal from

On July 29, 2005, FBI headquar
ters sent an e-mail to all 56 field 
offices to recruit agents for a 
new anti-obscenity squad. The 
squad, which will consist of ten 
agents (for now), is the first step 
in carrying out one of Gonzales

national security.
Just so you know, policing 
porn is still a lower priority than 
protecting the United States from 
terrorist attacks. It is, however, 
a1 higher priority than prevent

It is also a higher priority than,

phy, much less eradicate it. Fur
thermore, taking on obscenity in 
a time of high political tension, 
when we are engaged in a foreign 
war, with a significant portion 
of our population displaced and 
part of our country underwater, 
seems less like a real objective 
and more like a diversionary 
tactic. Weve got better things to 
worry about.
Just to give you an idea of the 
porn industrys role in the U.S.: 
It grosses $12 billion annually. 
It makes more money than all 
professional basketball, football, 
and baseball franchises com
bined. Companies such as Gen
eral Motors Investment Manage
ment Corp., Rupert Murdochs 
News Corp., and Time Warner 
Inc. all own companies that 
produce porn (DirecTV among 
them). Twelve percent of the In
ternet is pornographic content; 
there are 4.2 million websites 
devoted solely to pornography. 
Forty million adults regularly 
access porn on the Internet. 
Thats more than the entire pop
ulation of the state of California, 
and it discounts those who arent 
regular watchers.
Still in doubt about Americas 
relationship with porn? Go to 
Las Vegas. Walk around for, oh, 
roughly three minutes, and you 
will see more billboards, posters, 
magazines and business cards 
featuring pornographic content 
than you will ever need to see in 
your lifetime.
The sheer magnitude of the 
porn industry isnt the only 
obstacle in Gonzales path. He 
must also contend with the 
United States peculiar double 
standard when it comes to sex. 
Call it a leftover from our Puri
tanical days, but Americans have 
always had a love-hate relation
ship with the oldest act in the 
world. We refuse to talk about 
sex, but the incidence of casual 
sex between unmarried partners 
is on the rise. We cant condone 
divorce in public figures, but we 
can thrill to the show Desper
ate Housewives. We cant swear
laiiBiifi
on the air, but we can idolize 
Paris Hilton, a woman whose 
claim to fame is her own candid 
sex tape. We cant educate our 
children about birth control in 
public schools, and yet the oc
currence of teenage pregnancy 
is higher in this country than 
in most other nations of similar 
standing. Although obscenity is 
considered illegal, we cant even 
clearly define it, although there 
have been a number of winning 
tries, including Supreme Court 
Justice Potter Stewarts explana
tion that I know it when I see 
it.
Incidentally, the FBI has de
cided to focus on adult pornogra
phy between consenting adults, 
not child pornography (which is 
most definitely illegal, and which 
is featured on at least 100,000 
websites in the U.S. alone) or 
pornography that portrays nonconsensual, violent sex or rape. 
Just what values is Gonzales try
ing to promote by launching his 
porn squad?
Although our national lead
ers subscribe to the ideology 
of the 1980s that pornography 
is ruining our national frame
work, the evidence shows that 
its actually become a founda
tion of it. Moral qualms aside, to
Jennifer Kennedy/Art Staff
conduct a War on Porn right 
now would only lead to actions 
that are ill-informed, ill-timed, 
and impractical. In the wake of a 
major national disaster and dur
ing a time of war, our govern
ments powers would be much 
better spent protecting citizens 
rather than trying to shield them 
from nudie pictures.

I speakers need to  . '  ;  
I
David Levitt
According to the controversial 
speakers policy, if students are 
to learn to choose wisely, they 
must know what the choices are; 
and they must learn in an envi
ronment where no idea is un
thinkable and where no alterna
tive is withheld from their con
sideration. It should be noted 
that there are still some choices 
that we would not like others 
to make, including succumbing 
to racist or hateful ideologies. 
To implement this principle 
of openness in the University 
Lecture Series (ULS), no issue 
should be treated in a biased 
manner, so as to offer all of 
these choices to students. Why 
is it then, that the only two ULS 
speakers invited to talk about 
Israel were both vehemently 
anti-Israel, one representing an 
opinion bordering on racism? 
These problems could have 
been prevented through a more 
open and transparent selection 
process for ULS speakers.
The first speaker to talk 
about Israel was Ali Abunimah, 
a known Israel opponent. His 
speech was largely academic,
though his picture of reality was 
focused on Palestinian suffer
ing. He ignored Israeli suffering 
and acts of aggression by indi
vidual Palestinians and groups 
of Palestinians, as well as the 
lack of action by Palestinian 
authorities in preventing such 
acts. His biased perspective was 
not the final word on the topic.
The other lecture on Israel 
was Norman Finkelsteins talk 
titled Beyond Chutzpah: On 
the Misuse of Anti-Semitism 
and the Abuse of History. For 
those unfamiliar, here are some 
highlights from his most famous 
book, The Holocaust Industry. In 
it, he writes, The Holocaust has 
proven to be an indispensable 
ideological weapon. Through its 
deployment... the most success
ful ethnic group in the United 
States has likewise acquired 
victim status. Referring to 
Jews as the most successful 
ethnic group is an unfair gen
eralization, characteristic of 
Finkelsteins method of per
suasion. Finkelstein draws on 
peoples prejudices to color Jews 
and Israel negatively, while hid
ing behind his Jewish heritage 
to prevent criticism. He goes on
to cite certain Holocaust revi
sionist literature as bringing an 
indispensable contribution to 
our knowledge of World War II, 
and justifies anti-Semitism in 
Europe as a result of the extor
tion of Jewish organizations. 
Justifying racism is equivalent 
to encouraging it, which should 
not have a place in the ULS.
Though many would argue 
that Finkelsteins rhetoric is not 
anti-Semitism, it is still hate
ful to a large portion of the 
Pittsburgh community and 
many CMU students. This 
brings its benign status into 
question. The ULS should not 
be a venue to test the boundar
ies of racism. What was the aim 
of bringing Finkelstein to cam-' 
pus? Was it meant to intimidate 
future victims of anti-Semitism 
from coming forward for fear 
of being accused of misusing 
anti-Semitism? At any rate, 
Finkelsteins lecture deadened 
the sting of future racism that 
may occur on our campus. If 
lectures like Finkelsteins were 
the norm, we would not have 
seen such an extreme outcry 
over Malik Zulu Shabazz last 
year. Giving the ULS organizers
the benefit of the doubt, the un
suitable nature of Finkelsteins 
message should have been ap
parent before he was invited.
The ULS organizers should 
have anticipated the effect of 
Finkelsteins rhetoric, and no
ticed that all of the speakers 
on Israel held an anti-Israeli 
viewpoint. In the unlikely 
event that it was an accident, 
last years problems could have 
been prevented through a more 
transparent speaker selection 
process: The committee to re
view the controversial speakers 
policy should appoint a board 
to formally deliberate the ULS 
speaker selection, considering 
the effect speakers may have. 
Deliberations should be made 
public, and their minutes pub
lished on the web. As tuitionpaying students, we deserve 
the respect of knowing why the 
administration selects their con
troversial speakers, as well as 
their anticipated effect on the 
campus community. This pro
posal will prevent a fiasco like 
last years, since reservations 
about speakers can be brought 
up during the selection process, 
instead of after.

THE TARTAN  SEPTEMBER 26, 2005All
FOOTBALL, from A16
nine. Faced with first-and-goal 
and needing a touchdown to win, 
though, the Tartans were unable 
to convert on the ground or in 
the air.
The final two plays saw Highberger fire incomplete passes into 
the end zone to seal the victory 
for the Diplomats. One of these 
passes was narrowly deflected by 
a Franklin & Marshall defender 
just in front of the outstretched 
hands of a Carnegie Mellon 
wideout.
The loss is a conspicuous start 
to a tough three-game road 
trip for the Tartans. Next week 
they travel to Colorado to play 
Colorado College, and thereaf
ter will face the University of 
Chicago in the windy city. They 
return home October 22.
CLUBSPORTS
Baseball
In a hard-fought battle, the 
Carnegie Mellon Tartans came 
out on the short end of the stick 
against the Franciscan Barons to 
begin the Bob Kloska Invitational 
Tournament.
Starter Pete Sukits battled all 
game long, but succumbed to 
a three-run rally in the bottom 
of the sixth to take the hard 
luck loss. Sukits threw 6 1/3 
innings, allowing seven runs. 
With one out in the sixth and 
a one-run lead, Sukits walked a 
man, allowed a single, and hit 
a man. Doug Peters came in in 
relief hoping to work out of the 
jam. He allowed a sacrifice fly to 
the first man, scoring one run, 
but getting the second out. The 
next batter, however, hit a baseclearing double, bringing in the 
final two runs.
The Tartan offense started hot, 
but cooled off late in the game. 
Jack Bader led the offense with a 
two-run homer, and Matt Corbett 
added an RBI double. Bader
doubled in the seventh, but the 
offense couldnt put together a 
rally.
In their second game of the 
tournament, the team finished 
on another sour note with a loss 
to the Robert Morris Colonials, 
6-2. Junior Doug Peters got the 
start and pitched three solid 
innings before tiring following his 
relief appearance in the previous 
game. Peters wound up with 
4 1/3 innings pitched, with five 
runs (four earned), four hits, five 
strikeouts and two walks.
The Tartan offense never really 
got rolling in the second game, 
with two RBI singles by catcher 
Ryan Comes accounting for all of 
their attacking power. CF Jiheon 
Kim led off the second with a 
single and was at third when 
Comes dropped a single into right 
field. In the fourth, LF Billy Ratliff 
led off with a walk, stole second, 
and scored on Comes single.
Peters took the mound in 
the fourth with a 2-0 lead and 
seemed to be cruising. After 
striking out the first batter, Peters
allowed a walk, single, and a 
batter reached on SS Dan Kings 
throwing error. A sac fly pushed 
the first run across, and a two-run 
double put the Colonials ahead 
for good. Peters came out for 
fourth inning, but was lifted after 
allowing a one out triple. Reliever 
Sandy Williams finished the game 
with 1 2/3 innings, allowing two 
runs and the inherited runner to 
score..
Head coach Claudio Reilsono 
expressed the sentiments of 
the entire team over their 
performance at the tournament. 
The past two losses have been 
as tough as I have ever had, he 
said. I know we had the better 
team, I know how hard we work, 
and I know how far we have come 
as players and as a team.... That is 
what makes it tough. We are now 
5-5. We have 10 more games to 
go. We will turn it around.
The Tartans get a chance to 
right the ship October 1 against 
Franciscan University, a team 
they have already lost two of 
three against this year.I IVI

Sophomore forward Scott Kuppe fires upheld for a win against Mount Union Saturday.
Mens soccer blanks Mount Union 3-0
fense with his speed on several 
breakaways. In the fourth min
ute, Jon Browne scored a goal 
high over the keeper with his left 
foot on an assist from Andrew 
Park. Despite the fact that most of 
the headers were won by Mount 
Union, the Tartans won many of 
the 50/50 balls and for the most 
part controlled the game with 
their midfield possession. They 
outshot the Raiders 10-5 but did 
not score again in the first half.
The intensity continued during 
the second half and resulted in 
a number of fouls. The second 
goal of the game was quite the 
spectacle. Park crossed the ball 
from deep on the left side into 
Browne, who dribbled into the 
box to face the keeper. However, 
Browne ended up in a struggle 
with the keeper in which both 
players rolled over on the ground 
in front of the goal. In the scuffle,
Browne finally tapped it in.
Immediately after, conflict en
sued as other players from the 
Mount Union team complained 
that they saw Browne grab the 
ball with his hands. Heated argu
ments broke out and as a result, 
the game intensified and both the 
Tartans and the Raiders became 
ensnared in a series of physical 
confrontations. Minutes later, a 
yellow card was given to Stephen 
Berei. Seconds after that, Raiders 
player Nathan Eaton blatantly 
elbowed a CMU player as he went 
up for a header. With a minute 
and five seconds left, CMUs Scott 
Kuppe scored a goal off an assist 
by William Schlough, bringing 
the score to 3-0.
Overall, the Tartans stayed 
strong and pushed through as a 
team. They return to the field at

Tennis team overcomes injuries at ITAs
by Andrew Clearfield
Assistant Sports Editor
For sophomore Carnegie Mel
lon tennis star Amy Staloch, this 
past weekends regional Intercol
legiate Tennis Association tour
nament was supposed to be her 
chance to validate her number 
four national singles ranking and 
overall number one seeding in 
the region. But, after a severe eye 
infection forced her to default in 
the quarterfinals, that chance will 
have to wait until next year.
Despite Stalochs injury, the 
Tartans did manage to salvage 
some good results from the tour
nament. First-year Sheena David 
was especially impressive, win
ning four matches on her way to 
the quarterfinals. Alison Liu, the 
teams lone senior and the tour
naments 11th seed, also made 
some headway in the draw, over
coming an opening round upset 
loss to make it all the way to the 
finals of the consolation bracket.
The results bode well for Carn
egie Mellon, which looks to re
place two starters from last years 
15th-ranked team. Assistant 
coach Kevin Girard was especially 
pleased with the results, saying,
Overall it was a great tourna
ment for us. Amys injury was un
fortunate but we are very excited 
about the results, it shows that we 
are one of the top couple of teams 
in the region.
Sophomore Samantha Schultz, 
who fell in the first round, echoed 
these sentiments, saying, We did 
really good. I think we proved 
that were right behind Washing
ton & Lee as the second best team 
in the tournament. I had a tough 
tournament, but playing people 
that good is really tough and its 
amazing how well everyone else 
did.
The doubles draw of the tour
nament was especially tough 
for the Tartans. Besides losing 
Staloch, the 15th-ranked dou
bles player in the country, CMU 
was also without Junior Mona 
Iyer, Stalochs doubles partner 
from a year ago who is taking 
the fall off to focus on her aca
demics. The team of Schultz and 
Kelly Nakamura lost in the first 
round to the tournaments topseeded team. Mai Otsuka and 
Liu managed the most successful 
doublesrun, squeezing by their 
first-round match 8-6 and mak
ing it all the way to the third 
round  an especially impres
sive result, considering that the 
team was unseeded entering the 
tournament.
Both Kevin Girard and head 
coach Andrew Girard were 
pleased with the results. Kevin 
Girard said, It shows a lot of 
depth that we were able to win 
some matches even without our 
number-one team. During the 
year thats going to be important 
for us to win those matches at 
number-two and number-three 
doubles, especially against the 
top teams.
Andrew Girard concurred: It 
was a great tournament for us. 
Two of our freshmen beat ranked 
players in singles and everybody 
pretty much won at least the 
matches they were supposed to. 
Carnegie Mellon next turns 
its attention to its September 27 
match against West Liberty State. 
They end their fall season with 
the Washington & Lee Invita
tional on October 7. The Tartans 
will look to avenge last seasons 
loss in the NCAA tournaments 
second round, when the team 
was blanked by the Generals 6-0. 
Carnegie Mellon is 1-0 foj the 
year in team play and does not be
gin the bulk of the team schedule 
until the spring season.

four of their matches at the 2005 
Carnegie Mellon Crossover. With 
the victories, the Tartans now 
stand at 12-5 on the season, 
after beginning the year with a 
3-5 stretch.
In their first home match, 
Carnegie swept Marietta 
College: 30-16, 30-22, and 
30-22, Junior hitters Amanda 
Bradford and Catie Fisher led 
the Tartan attack with 11 and 
13 kills, respectively, and libero 
Kathryn Fox frustrated the 
opposing hitters with 19 digs. 
Senior middle hitter Chrissy 
Bartek added seven more 
kills, and Setter Brea Carlock 
fashioned 34 assists. The team 
as a whole finished with five 
blocks.
On Friday and Saturday, 
CMU hosted its lone home 
tournament of the year, as seven 
schoolsAllegheny, Gettysburg, 
Heidelberg, Ithaca, John Carroll, 
Nazareth, and Rochester 
Institute of Technology (RIT) 
 were invited to the 2005 
Carnegie Crossover. The Tartans 
opened their tournament on the 
first day with a tough five-game
win over the Heidelberg College 
Student Princes: 30-27, 30-28, 
28-30, 25-30, and 15-13. Later 
that evening, Carnegie took a 
four-game set from Gettysburg 
College, as they beat the Bullets 
30-25, 27-30, 30-23, 30-23.
On Saturday, the Tartans 
continued their remarkable run, 
sweeping both teams that they 
played. At noon, Carnegie took 
down the Allegheny College 
Gators: 30-26, 30-21, and
been winning of late ---- they
have been dominating. CMUs 
game against John Carroll on 
Saturday marked its seventh 
sweep of the season. The team, 
in fact, has swept six of its last 
nine matches. Coach Kelly 
knows that it is important to 
keep her team playing at this 
level, and to keep the teams 
priorities straight.
We need to finish strong and 
have fun, said Kelly.
The team has learned to play 
together and work as a team.
Head coach Kim Kelly
30-27. The team then ended 
the tournament with its second 
sweep of John Carroll (Ohio) 
this season: 30-21, 30-28, and 
30-24.
CMU, after a start that did 
not live up to head coach Kim 
Kellys expectations, is now 
12-5 and riding a nine game 
winning streak. The winning 
streak is a credit both to the 
teams improved consistency and 
its newfound ability to dominate 
defensively at the net.
The team has learned to play 
together and work as a team, 
said Kelly. I felt that they played 
very well. They fought hard. 
They showed that they can come 
back and win.
The Tartans have not only
Staying hot over the next few 
weeks is the Tartans primary 
goal, and they are peaking at 
the right time. The team has two 
UAA round robin tournaments 
coming up, one at Case Western 
University and another at 
Washington University. At these 
competitions, the Tartans will 
match up against such schools 
as New York University, Chicago, 
Brandeis, and Emory. Coach 
Kelly, though, is not worried 
about any sort of letdown.
I am quite confident that we 
will make a very good showing, 
stated Kelly.

tournament at Case Western 
Reserve University next 
weekend.
Football team slips versus F&M 6-0
by Christian DAndrea
Sports Editor
A sterling defensive effort 
wasnt enough as Carnegie 
Mellon fell short against Franklin 
& Marshall College Saturday. 
The Tartans final drive fell short 
as a fourth-and-goal pass was 
incomplete to seal the loss, 6-0. 
Carnegie Mellon fell to 2-2 in 
the season, while Franklin & 
Marshall notched their first win.
Both teams presented stellar 
defensive efforts, as the Tartans 
set the tone of the game early. 
Franklin & Marshall strung 
together a few big plays to set up 
first-and-goal at the Tartans 10. 
The defense held tough, leading 
to a fourth-and-three pass that 
fell incomplete. After a few quick 
possessions on both sides, the 
Tartans found an opportunity at 
the end of the first quarter.
Diplomat punter Tim Barry 
fumbled a snap on fQurth-andgoal. Though the Diplomats 
recovered, the ball was turned 
over to the Tartans on the 42- 
yard line. However, the offense 
couldnt capitalize, giving up a 
sack before punting.
This was a recurring theme of 
the game, as the team failed to
capitalize or get any momentum 
going in their favor.
The Tartans appeared to 
be putting together their first 
drive of the game in the second 
quarter, as sophomore Travis 
Sivek picked up 14 yards on the 
ground and quarterback Kevin 
Mulkern nailed junior Jon Kline 
with a 10-yard pass to move to 
their 46-yard line. However, 
Mulkern fumbled on a rush up 
the middle, turning the ball back 
over to the Diplomats.
Though they failed to score, 
they were able to pin the Tartans 
down on their own four-yard 
line to start their drive. Again, 
the offense began to move the 
chains, as Sivek, sophomore 
Rob Gimson and junior Colby 
Whitman gained 57 yards on 
nine consecutive running plays. 
Unfortunately, disaster struck 
when the offense went to the 
air, as Mulkerns first pass of 
the drive was intercepted and 
returned 20 yards to the F&M 
45-yard line.
Again, the Carnegie Mellon 
defense held tough, keeping 
their opponents scoreless at 
the half. However, the offense 
was still unable to convert, 
as Mulkern threw another 
interception to open up the
second half. Here, the Diplomats 
finally capitalized, kicking a 
31-yard field goal to take the 
lead 3-0.
The Tartans looked as if they 
would storm right back, as 
10 straight rushes bought the 
team to the Diplomats 20-yard 
line. As the drive stalled, the 
team sent out junior placekicker 
Nathaniel Greenstein, who had 
nailed two field goals in last 
weeks loss to Johns Hopkins. 
However, his attempt from 38 
yards went wide left.
Jarrod Highberger took over 
for the team as quarterback at 
the end of the third quarter, but 
found no more success scoring 
than Mulkern. The team was 
unable to get anything going on 
offense, and the Diplomats were 
able to wear down the defense 
and the clock as the game ran 
down. After another field goal, 
Franklin & Marshall led 6-0 with 
just 5:28 to play.
With their backs against the 
wall, the Tartan offense came out 
strong. Gimson led the running 
attack while Highberger found 
Kline several times as the Tartans 
moved the ball from their 35- 
yard line to their opponents

Womens soccer routs Mount Union 4-0

Sports Editor
Senior midfielder Margaret 
Beck powered the Tartans past 
Mount Union with two goals as 
the womens soccer team regis
tered a 4-0 shutout against Mount 
Union College. It was the teams 
sixth shutout of the year and it 
improves their record to 6-0-1 as 
non-division play winds down. 
The win came after a 1-0 blanking 
of Frostburg State Wednesday 
night.
In the first game, senior for
ward Nadya Yaghoubi scored what 
turned out to be the deciding goal 
only 15 minutes into the half. The 
goal came off a crisp one-timer 
pass from junior Megan Hughes 
as Yaghoubi beat Frostburg goalie
Molly Whyte with a rocket to the 
right side of the net. This would 
be the one mistake Whyte would 
make, as she would record ten 
saves on the night and turn away 
many of the Tartans offensive at
tempts. Much of the game was 
spent near the Frostburg goal, as 
Carnegie Mellon outshot their op
ponents 17-6. Tartan goalie Mary 
Ashe, a first-year, made four saves 
to record the shutout.
The Carnegie Mellon offense 
was more potent in the second 
game of the week, tallying four 
goals against Mount Union. 
Despite a slow start in which the 
Tartans were shut out in the first 
half, the team roared back in the 
second with Becks first goal com
ing just seven minutes into the pe
riod. Beck connected again for her 
third goal of the season 15 minutes
later. First-year Abigail Coffin, the 
teams leading scorer, made the 
score 3-0 minutes later. Coffin 
capitalized, tapping a slow roller 
into an empty net as midfielder 
Jessica Howard put a header past 
the Mount Union keeper.
First-year Laura Steidel finished 
the scoring for the Tartans, tap
ping in a header from a corner 
kick by Kasey Stever. The teams 
four goals all came within 25 min
utes of each other. First-year Mary 
Ashe made two saves in the shut
out.
The Tartans will host Al
legheny College at home on 
September 27 before beginning 
their UAA conference schedule. 
They face the University of Chi
cago at home October 2 before 
traveling to Washington Univer
sity in Saint Louis on October 9.Senior forward Hallie Dumont runs past a Mount Union defender Saturday.

Big Als Metal Review
Max Cavalera of Soulfly writes soulful tracks
Watching the daily news, one might think that 
we have descended into an inescapable spiral 
of chaos and destruction. What were once firm 
boundaries have now been washed away. Openmouthed in horror, we can only stand by as 
violent images sear our retinas. Tsunamis and 
hurricanes show the capacity of humans to suffer 
in their aftermath, sometimes turning on each 
other in desperation and malice.
Increasingly militarized and polarized, our society 
trudges forward toward an ever more uncertain 
future. Our innocence erodes, and we look to 
artists to reflect this pain and soothe our spirit.
Cavalera (vox, guitar) has gone through. Personal 
loss has punctuated this last year for Max, and 
Carved Inside reflects his turmoil. Still, there 
is the determination in his words that makes one 
feel that he is looking to understand and take 
control of his life.
Arise Again, The March, Frontlines, and 
much of the rest of the album stand out in their 
stripped-down construction. While Max has been 
one of the most exploratory metal musicians in 
history, Dark Ages is a ferocious album, more 
straight-up thrash. Maybe even borrowing from 
his old band Sepultura. References like Arise
Babylon, the albums second track, is an 
apocalyptic vision of our world. As we return to 
the time of warring tribes, the struggle for our 
soul starts from within. Carved Inside seems 
to reflect some of the personal pain that Max

Max Cavaleras personal trauma is reflected in his music.
Music can distract us from our darkening society; 
this is the sole reason for pop music. Or music can 
confront it, possibly giving us the catharsis we 
need to go on with our day. This, in my mind, is 
the sole reason for metals continued existence. 
Confusion continues a long way beyond 
adolescence, at least for me. Albums like Dark 
Ages, Soulflys soon-to-be-released masterpiece, 
reveal this pain and confusion. But is there any 
resolution?
pop up in the song structure every now and again, 
and are a reminder of Maxs roots. There are 
tribal interludes, flamenco guitar and sounds 
from the city framed by silence. But they take 
a backseat to the vision of this album, which is 
bleaker than one may have expected. Sirens wail, 
helicopters roar and explosions surround you. All 
frame an album that is at war with our society and 
its direction. The question remains: Who will win 
out in the end?

The radio station WRCT started a revised broadcast schedule designed to 
keep both Techs midnight oilers and afternoon drowsers company, The 
Tartan reported. They also started a number of features, including novelty 
music programs. WRCT said they were looking for eager spinners to 
join up with the station, and were surprised when protests among the 
afternoon oilers and the mid-morning drowsers began  these students 
felt disenfranchised by the program. Personally, I only oil in the evening; 
midnight is out of the question.

September 23,1980
The Tartan reported on a female student from Baylor University who was 
asked not to attend her graduation ceremony because she had posed for 
Playboy. Subsequent editorials about the incident published in Baylors 
newspaper caused an uproar, and action was taken against some of Baylors 
newspaper staff. From what I understand the issue was hody debated, and 
held important implications for the right to free speech. But most of all it 
had importance for those who still believe in the power of a pin-up.
10 YEARS AGO 
September 25,1995
The Tartan announced the popularity of new sports groups on campus. 
Mainly, the article focused on the Explorers Club, which had just started 
up. The general consensus is that the typical CMU student is a meek book
worm, hooked to his or her computer. Judging from student participation in 
adventure sports, looks can be deceiving. What The Tartan didnt realize was 
that those students thought adventure sports meant day-long escapades 
playing Final Fantasy. No, kids, the Explorers Club does net explore the 
Kingdom 0 Dragons. It has nothing to do with World ofWarcraft.

September 25,2000
In national news, The Tartan followed the story of a four-year-old boy who 
was injured when he was pinned beneath a car on a ride at Disneyland. The 
ride he was injured on was called the Roger Rabbit Car Toon Spin Ride. I 
know this makes me a bad person, but I keep picturing a small child being 
held over a vat of The Dip. And I dont mean that song by Freak Nasty.

The Tartan made a boo boo. A very large boo boo. We printed the paper, 
but one page had an older version sent to the printer from before it had 
ever gone through the final stage of proofreading: the stage where we add 
(cough) real headlines. As a result, one headline read, Dude with a strange 
name, Mumia... and captions read caption me z. Were still trying to 
figure out what that means.

Swedish assault!
Diingen, the Scandinavian psychedelic soldiers of rock n roll, pillage our village
On September 17,2005  a date which will live in infamy
 the OSC Drill Deck was suddenly and deliberately 
attacked by the psychedelic rock forces of the country of 
Sweden. The bombardment lasted only 80 minutes and at 
the end, we all came to understand the truth. Rock n roll 
is not dead: it was merely forced into early retirement by 
synthesizers, beat machines, and glow-sticks. Who are the 
new musical heroes to rescue the senile, perverted genre 
from its adult living community in Boca? None other 
than Swedish neo-psychedelic powerhouse Dungen.
Psychedelic music, though mostly gone from todays 
popular repertoire, emerged in 1964 and dominated 
until Woodstock in 1969. The screeching guitar amp 
effects, chilling organ solos, and drug-inspired lyrics 
were exemplified by popular bands in America such as 
Jefferson Airplane and Cream, as well as by lesser-known 
groups such as Bubble Puppy and Ultimate Spinach.
The brainchild of todays Swedish psych representation 
is a young music prodigy, Gustav Ejestes  a 
spitting Swedish image of Robert Plant. Dungen 
(pronounced DOON-yen, Swedish for a small 
gathering of trees) was, like its forebears, 
unknown in its native Scandinavia until the 
band started receiving good press in America.
We decided to sit down with the unsung heroes 
of Dungen  guitarist/Kurt-Cobain-lookalike 
Reine Fiske and drummer/all-around-nice-guy 
Fredrik Bjrling  as they shared insight into 
their band and the modern music scene.
On the 60s psychedelic from which Dungen 
draws their influence: There wasnt much 
of that kind of music released in Sweden, 
said Fredrik. I think everybody listened 
to [The] Jimi Hendrix Experience. Only 
with the advent of a handful of compilations 
released in the past few years have people 
begun to learn about the history of Swedish 
rock. Dungens latest offering, Ta Det Lugnt 
(Swedish for Take it Easy) is a refreshing 
drink of progressive psychedelic beverage that 
brings us back to a simpler time when, according to 
Reine, You have two mikes and a drum and you just sort 
of... (Here he imitates rocking out.)
Its sort of a low-fi thing, he explained. Ta Det Lugnt 
stays true to this tradition  unintentionally  despite 
the fact that it was recorded in a modern digital studio. 
This is the way we want it to sound. We have the sound 
we really like, explains Fiske.
become the mainstream music, proclaims Fredrik. Its 
like Britney Spears.
The band members are not sounding the death knoll for 
all of popular music, however. When asked about their 
favorite contemporary groups, their tastes were not 
limited by national borders. They cite American indie-pop 
all-stars The Shins and the English band The Clientele, 
as well as their countrymen The Soundtrack of Our Lives 
and The Works  the latter, they believe, most closely 
resemble their sound.
Dungen attests that the musical climate is very different 
in the Scandinavian socialist paradise. When asked about 
some of the emerging genres such as emo, they were 
surprisingly unfamiliar. In Sweden, there are no 
[music] scenes, says Reine. Its very hard to keep 
with modern music because on the national radio 
in Sweden, they only play crap music. We dont 
have the college radio like you have over here or the 
alternative radio stations because its so expensive to 
get licenses [to broadcast]
Try to put a record out yourself, challenged Fredrik. 
If its supposed to be that way you should be able to 
get everything free. Repair your car, build a house. 
However, the guys agree that downloading music 
is a new motive for change in the often oppressive 
recording industry. The thing that downloading 
has done is to maybe punch a hole in the record 
companies, to make them not so important. They 
are optimistic of the potential that technology 
affords unlikely musicians to make good 
recordings. I think the music is starting to sound 
more honest, in a way. Theres a lot of people sitting 
at home with their computer and can record songs and 
get popular and its often very beautiful.
And thus we leave Reine and Fredrik at II Valletto to 
finish their Italian wedding soup and chicken Caesar 
salads. The next time we see them, they are reunited 
with the rest of Dungen and in the company of a 
couple hundred of their closest friends in the OSC 
Drill Deck.
TA DET LUGNT!] Gustav roars. We nod our heads 
in agreement.

Youd think that Dungens exclusive use of the Swedish 
language in their songs would serve to discourage Englishspeaking listeners. On the contrary, the band members 
find that American listeners are often more receptive to 
their music. [Americans] dont understand [the foreign 
lyrics] and it becomes another instrument in relation to 
the melody, says Fredrik. They listen with open ears.
Dungen has noticed that Americans are tired of 
mainstream music, which in recent years has become 
predominately more rapand R&B-based. While the 
group admires some of the old school hip-hop groups, 
they feel that the genres current offerings 
have lost their novelty.

The Redwalls release De Nova
Products of old school rock, these boys have matured with their own style
Looking for the next big thing in rock n roll? Look no 
further, because Capitol Records has found it.
The Redwalls  vocalist/guitarist Logan Baren, 
vocalist/bassist Justin Baren, vocalist/guitarist Andrew 
Langer, and drummer Ben Greeno  have emerged 
out of Deerfield, 111., as one of the few bands in todays 
popular music scene that offer listeners a unique musical 
experience. Eclectic in their musical background, the 
Redwalls draw on an amalgam of musical styles to create 
a revamped rock n roll on their new CD, De Nova.
The Redwalls are up-and-coming rockers.
Courtesy of theredwalls.com
Although the oldest member of the Redwalls is only 22, 
the rockers prove on De Nova that their musicianship 
is far more mature than their ages would suggest. For 
example, the band accomplishes a feat not common in 
todays music: different musical styles in each song. The 
CD begins with Robinson Crusoe: in-your-face crunchy 
blues guitar and heart-pounding rhythms beautifully 
blended to create a melting pot of Chuck Berry blues and 
Ramones punk, keeping the passion and energy alive 
in the music. Vocal harmonies and keyboards dominate 
the CDs second song, Falling Down, giving it a style 
reminiscent of the pop rock of Green Day and Blink-182.
Having grown up listening to the Rolling Stones, Led 
Zeppelin, and the Beatles, the Redwalls also pay homage 
to their Brit-rock roots. Thank You is based on a smooth 
R&B groove that reminds listeners of Zeppelins The 
Lemon Song. Baren shouts during the chorus, Thank 
you for lovin me, cuz you and me are gonna be all right, 
revealing the optimism and innocence of being young 
and famous, an emotion which frequently emerged in the 
music of Zeppelin and the Stones.
The pace changes with Hung Up on the Way Im Feeling, 
which combines Pink Floyd ambience and Beatles pop 
with touches of Grateful Dead psychedelics. It is on this 
number that producer Rob Schnapf (The Vines, Beck) 
really shines. Schnapf cleverly creates an echo on the
drums to generate the illusion that the band is playing 
in a big stadium. This gives the music a spacey, cosmic 
effect. The guitars are not as heavy as they were toward 
the beginning of the record, and the lyrics no longer 
evoke a young and naive image.
That mood is extended when the Redwalls pay homage 
to Bob Dylan in their politically charged anthem Glory 
of War, an acoustic number that lacks the ferocity 
of Dylans protest songs, but replaces it with Barens 
aggressive, perceptive voice, matched with smooth 
synthesizer textures and simple yet well-played guitar.
De Nova then closes with an under-two-minute whirlwind 
rock anthem, appropriately dubbed Rock & Roll. The 
upbeat vocal harmonies and pounding drums are all 
glued together by Barens chant, Cmon, little girl, Ill 
teach you how to rock n roll. By the end of the track 
and the end of the CD  its safe to say that the Redwalls 
could teach all of us a thing or two about true rock.
We never fit in.... What we do is play rock n roll, 
explains Baren. The Redwalls, young and talented, have 
a bright future ahead of them. Its the outsiders, after all, 
who always throw the revolutions.

Life of Brian
Wednesday, September 28 
@ 8,10,12
Many people dont know this, but the 
British comedy troupe Monty Python 
actually made other movies besides 
Monty Python and the Holy Grail. In 
Life of Brian, a lovable loser was bom 
the same night as Jesus in the manger 
next door, and the film follows him as 
he lives his adult life and gets into a 
series of increasingly bizarre and hi
larious situations. Life of Brian is not 
as immediately quotable, but youll 
never be able to escape the Monty Py
thon fanboys who will be obnoxiously 
shouting out every line of dialogue. 
My advice? Get the Bible on Audio
book and listen to it on your iPod in 
the theater. It could very well create a 
whole new level of irony in the film.
Kontroll
Thursday, September 29 
@ 8,10,12
Here at Carnegie Mellon, we love our 
weird and enjoyable foreign movies. 
Kontroll is a Hungarian movie set in the 
subways under Budapest. The story fol
lows several wildly varied characters as 
their lives intertwine and weave around 
each other, but the real meat of the film 
is in its cinematography. Kontroll is 
said to look like an art movie without 
the annoyingly pretentious storytell
ing, or lack thereof, which is normally 
the standard for arty films. This means 
that it should be a hell of a fun movie to 
watch. And Thursday night homework 
is for suckers, anyway.
Howls Moving Castle
Corecti nsfksa7so .4 
Al:.4i R4i Rv:.4
Hooray for Japan! Miyazakis latest 
film, Howls Moving Castle, is based on a 
childrens book, but that doesnt mean 
that it isnt for everybody. The master 
of Japanese animation tells the story 
of a little girl who is turned into an 
old woman and finds a reluctant wiz
ard and I think they might fall in love. 
Whether or not they fall in love is un
important because the center stage in 
Miyazaki films is always the art. Expect 
insanely rich animation and coloring. 
Interestingly enough, the English lan
guage release of Howlrs Moving Castle 
has a bunch of ftuge-name actors doing 
the voices (Christian Bale, Billy Crystal, 
Jena Malone, and more), so you dont 
have to struggle with subtitles.

Madagascar
Saturday, October 1 
( 8,10,12
When it comes to computer-animated 
movies, there are Pixar movies and 
theres everything else. Madagascar is 
part of that everything else. Put out 
by Dreamworks and the guys behind 
Shrek, the movie tells the story of a 
group of zoo animals and their attempt 
to break out of captivity. Unfortunately 
it seems that talking animals in movies 
have not gone the way of music on MTV 
 out of style  and unfortunately for 
Madagascar, they should have. Memo

Documentaries rock. Especially doc
umentaries made by former music 
video directors about new Californiabased dance movements rising from 
the massive explosion of urban culture 
into the mainstream. Rize happens to 
fall into this category. Its got every
thing a good documentary should 
have: stunning cinematography, truly 
engaging stars, a message to spread, 
and of course, totally insane dancing. 
If you havent seen Rize yet, you need 
to clear space in your schedule on 
Sunday night, because its like nothing 
youve seen before.

---------------------------------------------------

The audience was crushed toward the front, pressing 
hard against one another and rocking with anticipation. 
The salty smell of sweat was overwhelming it wa^t 
least 80 degrees, and far warmer when pffllfd against 
the fans. If you were farther back, it was difficult to see 
the band members, since there was no proper stage 
to rise them up and make them visible. Sometimes, a 
little bit of blonde hair flew into focus above the crowds 
heads. **
\
Luckily, the Drill Deck was filled with energetic fans and 
an amazing band last Saturday, or the concerts venue 
might have made everyone there more uncomfortable. 
But as imperfect as the space may be, even the Drill Deck 
will be out of commission next semester when the new 
Gates building goes up. And when Gates moves in, there 
will be virtually no place on campus to present shows 
like last Saturdays concert by Dungen.
Next semester the Old Student Center will be torn 
down, taking with it one of the last places for smallerscale concerts to perform on campus, the Drill Deck. 
Highlander, another small venue, will reopen as a 
fitness area. The Highlander renovations are likely to 
include additions that will be a boon to campus life  
possibly a workout area and almost assuredly an area 
for dance practices - but it will no longer be an area that 
can be used for music concerts. According to Director 
of Housing and Dining Services Tim Michael, Housings 
plans include upgrades to one of the dining rooms so 
that dance group practice may occur on a scheduled 
basis.
The problem is there just isnt enough space on 
this campus to accommodate every ones 
events. The Highlander situation
is evidence: to make more spa<jj 
University' has to take away space!
|r one activity, the 
Sim another.
Cutting edge music, but where to put it?
The group most directly affected by the space crush is 
AB Coffeehouse, the perhaps inappropriately named 
group in charge of bringing less-than-mainstream bands, 
to campus.
AB Coffeehouse is run by a two-man team, Spencer 
Longo and Daniel Letson, sophomores in art and design, 
respectively. Even last ye?tr, the shows they booked were 
not usually held in Skibo. And this year, Skibo isnt even 
an option: A new organization dubbed AB Skibo is 
now exclusively booking shows there.
AB Coffeehouses old venues of choice were Highlander
 which was once a dining facility in Resnik Hall
 or the Drill Deck. With renovations to Highlander 
underway and the Drill Deck being taken opHite as early 
as Novftnber, Letson and Longo have few options for 
where to book their bands.
We have Rangos, but 
really only do certain sli 
there," Longo said about 
next semesters 
prospects. JK 
Both of f A
them believe Rangos is generally too large for the 
crowds they draw. By e-mail, Longo later added, 
You lose a lot of intimacy when there arent as many 
people in a cavernous room like [Rangos]. Wiegand 
Gymnasium poses the same problem  its far too big 
for the shows AB Coffeehouse brings, and the space is 
booked constantly. With ranfis junder high demand 
across the board, the heads of AB Coffeehouse will have 
to turn to other venues to house the bands they bring to
But there are few choices after, Rangos. The option 
we're going to have after nut is actually Doherty 
lecture halls." said Longo. Among other problems with 
the lecture halls  namely concerns of limited space 
up front for the band  is whether an off-campus 
audience could even find such obscure 
locations.

The growing problem with shrinking performance space

---------------------------------------------------

as Doherty lecture halls, Letson and Longo are turning 
to other alternatives. We always have the potential to 
have shows outside; that is something we can do, said 
Letson. The only thing is we need money for a stage; it 
costs about 500 bucks extra.
While AB Coffeehouse is definitely not designed to make 
a profit, they do need to make money on some shows. 
Without some profit, show scheduling would have to be 
cut in half.
AB Coffeehouse has considered alternate venues such as 
the Adamson Wing lecture hall, but there are concerns 
about the difficulty of getting equipment into that area, 
according to Longo. Another possibility is the Alumni 
Concert Hall within the College of Fine Arts building. 
However, both have said the initial reactions from those 
in AB and their advisor was that the space was not likely 
to work out. Even our advisor described it as kind of 
fancy,  Longo said.
The trouble with the Alumni Concert Hall might not 
be that its too fancy for AB, but that its simply hard 
to book much like Rangos. It is hard to schedule any 
additional events in Alumni Concert Hall at the beginning 
of the school year because the School of Music needs to 
make sure all student recitals and concerts are booked 
first, wrote Eric Sloss, Associate Media Director at the 
College of Fine Arts. Though Sloss believes it is possible to 
use the space, its unlikely that anything could be pinned 
down before November.
The campus stands to miss out if AB Coffeehouse cant 
find suitable spaces for shows. Letson and Longo are 
out to expose people to music on the margins. Their job, 
explained Longo, is to give students exposure to music 
outside of their usual rotation.
Its not about making a profit, said Longo. [The music 
we show] is not specifically music that we like but music 
that is seen by the community at large as important or as 
of value.
So where will AB Coffeehouse put these bands? Elizabeth 
Vaughan, Coordinator of Student Activities and advisor 
to AB, is optimistic about potential venues. Im confident 
that we can find something and that we will be able to 
provide shows next semester. If that means that we have 
to more creative about it, well, well be more creative 
about it. I think well end up recognizing what other 
venues are possible.
State of the stages: less than perfect
While AB Coffeehouse has been looking towards future 
show sites, groups like Dancers Symposium and Scotch 
n Soda are already planning their shows for this 
semester, and booking spaces for them. They dont face 
the complications of having their venues taken away 
from them, but theyll have to work around less than ideal 
areas.
Likewise, Scotch n Soda has struggled with venue space. 
The University Center is their main base for shows. We 
generally just stay within the UC, said Courtney Kochuba, 
a junior in English who is president of the Scotch n Soda 
Board. Rangos is our favorite spot just because its close 
to a real theater. When we had a show in Peter/Wright/ 
McKenna there were some people we had to turn away, 
which you never want to do.
There is a positive side to the smaller setting: Connor 
OMalley, managing director for the group and a senior 
in mechanical engineering, said smaller rooms tend to 
be more intimate. Some spaces have made the group get 
even more creative than usual, as they did with Scotch on 
the Rocks last year when they used the Connan room. It 
wasnt really a theater, said OMalley. That, for instance, 
was a different style of blocking for the directors. It does 
give you a really creative outlet to try to attempt new 
things, at the same time it can be a little limiting.
There are few solutions, though, for getting better venues 
for Dancers Symposium and Scotch n Soda shows.
Some might question why student organizations dont 
utilize the performance space within Purnell. But space 
in Purnell is at a premium, and majors take priority before 
student groups can vie for it. There are constantly things 
there, said Rives of the Chomsky Theater in Purnell. 
We [Carnegie Mellon] have a very elaborate drama 
program and [the drama majors] have very elaborate 
needs. Dancers Symposium did shows in the Kresge
theater at one time, 
but Rives noted that 
the audience grew too 
large for the space, 
and the stage was 
poorly shaped for a 
dance performance.
Another option 
is constructing 
an entirely new 
building to house 
performances. We 
wish we had a student 
theater, said Kochuba, But there obviously isnt one. 
OMalley added that if a student theater was built, it 
would help Scotch n Soda get better recognition and 
more power for securing rehearsal and performance 
space throughout the season.
Building a new theater space seems unlikely for the 
foreseeable future. According to Jennifer Church, 
Associate Dean of Student Affairs, there is no current 
plan to build a student theater space on campus. For now, 
student performance groups are left to work with what 
they have  meaning Dancers Symposium and Scotch 
n Soda shows are staying put in the UC.
Practice makes perfect: an improving space situation
Its not all gloom for spaces on campus. Though 
performance space is tight and far less than ideal, the 
situation with practice space is improving. One area thats 
gotten a lot of praise is the Morewood Multipurpose Room
 a space created last year that can be used for both 
theater practices and dance practices. Kochuba noted 
how it has eased space fears on campus a bit, and Rives 
also noted that Dancers Symposium uses it to practice. 
Both groups are still struggling with practice rooms, 
though. Dancers Symposium, in particular, faces trouble 
as it grows larger. Rives expressed how difficult it is to 
get enough practice time in before the show, since most 
rooms for practice can only be used a certain number of
Abigail Rives, a fifthyear senior in biology 
and philosophy and a 
director for Dancers
Symposium, described 
the problem with current 
performance spaces.
There is no available 
dance performance 
space on campus. Rangos 
Ballroom is the closest 
thing to it. Since the floor
is flat its not a very good venue for it because once you 
get to Rangos 2 you cant see the [dance] floor. Rives 
wrote via e-mail that choreographers are discouraged 
from using floor work during the dances, as large parts 
of the audience cant see the dancers when they move 
close to the floor.
Im confident that we can find 
something and that we will be able 
to provide shows next semester.

recognized student groups such as Dancers Symposium.
With the re-emergence of Highlander this spring, the 
practice situation will get better  at least for official 
campus groups. Highlander will open up a new practice 
space, and give groups one more place to go to hone 
their performances. Rives sees hope in the practice space 
situation. If you put up hardwood floors and put up a 
mirror then we have a place to [practice]. I think thats 
an easy thing to fix and I think it is slowly but surely being 
fixed.
Last Words
Will the campus space squeeze situation ever be remedied? 
No plans are currently in the works for a new theater 
space, according to Church. At this point, it may be up to 
the students to start an effort to create a student theater, 
Kochuba suggested. She also mentioned that two years 
ago students had come together to form SIFTA (Student 
Initative For The Arts), a group organized to raise money 
for a student theater. Though the group has dissolved, it 
is possible that reviving it  or starting a similar group 
 could help create the funds and the publicity needed to 
inspire the construction of a student theater.
hours every week. Its all very limited hours, and not 
ideal hours.... We have people who rehearse at midnight, 
said Rives.
Reserving a room can be overly complicated, as well. You 
schedule rooms through the UC and the UC scheduling 
staff may say that you cant have a certain room, said 
OMalley. You have to talk through the UC administration 
to talk with the heads of the groups youre competing 
with for space.
If you think the space situation is hard for recognized
Alejo Grigera/Art Staff
campus groups, imagine the trouble that independent 
students have. Latika Kirtane, a senior computer science 
major, is a member of the band Awaaz. Kirtane said 
that last year the group often practiced in one members 
apartment and had to drag equipment across campus 
and risk bothering his roommates. It would be great if 
students were allowed to book these rooms independently 
through an online system or something, Kirtane wrote 
via e-mail. There are a few options for the general student 
body to get space, mainly the Morewood Multipurpose 
Room and the UC Activities Room. However, these two 
areas are already under demand from fitness classes and
Church noted that the University has made strides to help 
create more performance space, mainly by tiling Weigand 
Gymnasium so that it had better acoustics. Church also 
noted that the University had added stage and sound 
system to Skibo [Coffeehouse].
These things certainly help concert areas, but Weigand is 
far too large for the types of shows AB Coffeehouse puts 
on. When asked about Skibo or Wiegand as a potential 
space for Scotch n Soda, OMalley wrote via e-mail that 
it would be good for a cabaret or something similar, but 
that doesnt happen that often with our group. He also 
added that since Skibo is open to any student dropping 
in for a java, Scotch n Soda probably couldnt charge 
admission to an event there. As for Wiegand, OMalley 
said it was probably too big and added that to do a formal 
performance there would require it to be rented out for a 
technical week, which he felt was unlikely.
Small strides show that there may be hope for an increase 
of space on campus. For the time being, however, a little 
creativity and ingenuity are going to have to go a long 
way in planning where to perform on campus.

The Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra gets into gear
This years lineup of world-renowned performances
With a renewed membership from its successful subscrip
tion campaign last season, the PSO stands poised to give a 
knock-out set of concerts. Among the seasons delights are 
Holsts Planets, Rachmaninoffs Second Piano Concerto, and 
Beethovens Third Symphony, subtitled Eroica.
Last weekend the PSO performed Carl Orffs masterpiece 
Carmina Burana, a review of which can be found in this 
issue. Jennifer Higdon, as the PSOs resident composer for 
the season, will have her music performed throughout the 
following months. Her new trombone concerto will premiere 
in February, and the PSO will perform her transcendent blue 
cathedral in November as a beautiful example of modern 
music. Many conductors will be joining in on the amazing 
season, including Hans Graf from Houston, Robert Spano from 
Atlanta, Christoph von Dohnanyi from Cleveland, and Charles 
Dutoit.
For those who dont prefer esoteric classics, the PSO also has 
a great series of pops concerts with such selections as Joseph 
and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat and pieces by Cole 
Porter.
So instead of partying one night, try out the symphony. Here 
are some recommendations:
Respighis Pines of Rome and Tchaikovskys Violin Concerto: 
Nov. 10-12
Rachmaninoffs Second Piano Concerto: Feb. 10-12
Holsts The Planets: April 21-23
Vaughan Williams The Lark Ascending: April 27-30
With the advent of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestras new 
season, a vast, awe-inspiring realm of classical music has 
opened itself to its unsuspecting audience. CMU students have 
a special chance to discover music in a whole new form, for 
our local professional musicians have lined up an outstanding 
gamut of musical prospects. On September 9, the Pittsburgh 
Symphony Orchestra (PSO) showcased world-renowned cellist 
Yo-Yo Ma in a televised blockbuster performance that gave a 
scintillating beginning to a promising season.
On September 16, I experienced the PSO in full swing as 
they ripped through Stravinskys powerful Rite of Spring. The 
orchestras powerful, primal rhythm tore consciousness and 
thought apart, and for the second concert of the season, the 
PSO put their best foot forward. If this truly is the harbinger of 
things to come, no amount of reason should keep anyone away 
from Heinz Hall this school year.
simple. All you have to do is take any 61 bus downtown with 
the amazing bus pass and get off at Fifth and Market. Cross the 
street, and a few blocks later Heinz Hall will be on your right.
Need tickets? As students, everyone can go to the concert 
hall two hours in advance and get rush tickets for $14 with 
ID. If you get to Heinz Hall early enough, your seats could be 
astonishing. My rush ticket got me a seat nine rows from the 
stage! And in the two hours you have to kill, theres a Starbucks 
right across the street from the hall, and an informative pre
concert lecture one hour before the event. After the concert, 
the symphony provides a talk-back session to speak with 
other audience members and musicians of the PSO about how 
the performance went. The talk-back session after The Rite of 
Spring found everyone still buzzing from Stravinskys intensity, 
and I particularly enjoyed the experience of being able to share
this emotional high with others. Our conversation knocked off 
an entire hour without any of us noticing. Its a whole evening 
of good entertainment for $14 that cannot be found anywhere 
else.
One of the nations top orchestras resides right here in 
Pittsburgh, and it is giving us all the best chance to enjoy some 
of the finest music known to man. The concert hall is a venue 
for magnificence one can access easily and affordably. With 
a legacy of centuries supporting the efforts of the modern 
orchestra, classical music concerts remain the zenith of beauty 
and pleasure. So take advantage of your time in Pittsburgh and 
go see a concert this semester!

Carmina Burana comes to Pittsburgh
Sensual music that college students can appreciate
This weekend, conductor Rafael Friihbeck de Burgos 
led the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra and singers in 
expressing feelings that a college student will know all too 
well. College students can easily relate to Orffs sexually 
themed Carmina Burana and Mendelssohns incidental 
music to A Midsummer Nights Dream also about young 
love.
The overture of A Midsummer Nights Dream began with 
tender chords followed by a blind, constant motion of 
the strings. Mendelssohn, who was only 16 when he 
composed this movement, was experiencing a teens 
immature passion. Akeen listener can easily pickup on the 
familiar feelings of a curious boy becoming a man.
The Scherzo was a more serious piece in which the 
blossoming youth had decided to enter the world of 
love. In Song for Chorus, the voices of Chen Reiss, Katy 
Shackleton Williams, and the Mendelssohn Choir blended 
wonderfully to announce that this boy had entered a 
world of fantasy. They let him know that love would give 
him feelings that are new and quite enjoyable.
The Intermezzo opened with confusion, as anxious 
thoughts were tossed back and forth between the winds 
and strings. The youthful boy leaves his lover in the night, 
and she is not sure whether to be worried or hurt. In 
Nocturne, the horns play a duet that mimics the way 
the young lovers would make love in the still of the night. 
Warmth could be felt between the lovers when the or
chestra played this movement.
Everybody knows the Wedding March  Here Comes 
the Bride  and each member of the brass section 
thoroughly enjoyed their five minutes of fame in this 
movement. Tuba player Craig Knox played especially well 
and really dug into the thirds of the secondary dominant 
chords. His passionate performance told the orchestra, 
Im going this way, and youd better follow. And follow 
they did.
If you have never heard Carmina Burana while reading Nmon Ford sang well as the man seeking love, but Reiss
the translation (or the original text, should you happen was incredible. She sang In truitina in the most
Carl Orffs Carmina Burana is about sex, sex, sex, 
and drinking. Any college student should be able to 
appreciate it.
The balance between the choir, soloist, and orchestra was 
perfect. On occasion, the horns were a little overpower
ing. This and the choice of using ecclesiastical Latin were 
the only things that could improve. The trumpets and 
flutes, though, had an exceptionally good performance
 their articulation was always in synch, and every flute 
solo and duet was dripping with emotion.
to be fluent in Latin and antiquated forms of German and 
French), I recommend doing so. Beurens poems envoke 
how fortune can turn a king into a beggar or a swan into 
dinner with a flick of her fingerand for this reason, we 
should enjoy life while we have the chance. They follow 
into a couples mutual attraction, neither is the others 
feelings. When lascivious love becomes too powerful, 
they give in to sexual temptation.
extraordinary way possible. Scott Scullys swan solo was 
also breathtaking. Certainly, every voice on stage did just 
what it had to in order to give a great performance.

HOROSCOPES.
BY FRANKLIN WILLIAMS
ARIES (March 21 - April 19): Yesterday your mother called you to tell 
you she was lonely. You might want to keep her company  before I 
do. '
TAURUS (April 20 - May 20): Remember when you went to that deli 
yesterday? Remember when you got pissed that they didnt give you any 
mustard packets? Remember how your shoes felt squishy and wet with a 
slightly spicy aftertaste this morning? Check your socks.
GEMINI (May 21 - June 21): Your girlfriends pregnant. With twins. 
Congrats! :-D
CANCER (June 22 - July 22): Tomorrow you will be really really 
ridiculously good looking when I look at you in the back side of a spoon. 
But a spork is better.
LEO (July 23 - August 22): rawr
VIRGO (August 23 - September 22): About a month ago you filled 
every container in your house with gas in fear that prices would rise to 
somewhere between $5 and $50 a gallon within a few days. Remember 
that milk you gave your cat this morning? Remember how it smelled 
funny? Yeah. Have you seen your cat today? I think not.
LIBRA (September 23 - October 22): After finishing Wicked last night, 
you decided to write a fan-fiction sequel, Wicked 2: Son of a Witch, Bad 
idea. Bad bad idea. Oh wait., its actually being published. Bad idea. 
Bad bad idea.
SCORPIO (October 23 - November 21): God I hate when you get a 
fortune that doesnt really tell you about your future, but rather tells you 
something completely arbitrary about yourself. Today's fortune: You are 
a lovely human person. Lucky numbers: 4 10 249 7 12"
SAGITTARIUS (November 22 - December 21): Yes. Its true. Your 
business professor wants your pants and is willing to give you As across 
the board for it. But hey, this is business, and youve found your way to 
the top. So go ahead  bring him an apple and tell him how you feel.
CAPRICORN (December 22 - January 19): Your professor happens to 
have one of those horribly soothing Ive been smoking for the last 35 
years so f have a super-deep, smooth voice that you associate with a 5'3B 
balding man with a toupee and beard" voice. You should encourage him 
to do movie previews. We always need a few more movie voices.
AQUARIUS (January 20 - February 18): Yes, those are Catholic 
schoolgirls. No, theyre not for you. Theyre like 15. Sicko.
PISCES (February 19 - March 20): Tonight, be careful when you go back 
to your room. When you open the door, there will probably be a random 
dude and chick in your bed. And theyll probably be naked. Ass naked. 
After they leave, I recommend burning your sheets. Yeah, you dont want 
those anymore.

Conference Special
26 September 2005 ___________ _______________ THE TARTAN Cl
019Kon trlR W1t 1RrloD THE
by Louisa Kinoshi
Staffwriter
Over 100 employers will be recruiting on campus 
this week at the annual Business Opportunities and 
Technical Opportunities Conferences. Both confer
ences have been historically successful events, vis
ited by over 1000 students across all majors.
Major companies to be represented include 
LOral, GlaxoSmithKline, JPMorgan Chase, and 
IBM. Recruiters come to this school because they 
know we have a high work ethic and we are high 
caliber students, said Julie Qiu, a business adminis
tration senior and one of the organizers of the BOC.
Many students have gotten full time positions and 
internships by attending these conferences. Mellon 
College of Science Career Consultant Renee Starek 
explained that when companies like LOral come 
to the fair, they conduct their screening interviews
a few days later.
Students should come prepared to both confer
ences, Starek advised. The Business Opportunities 
Conference in particular has a very strict dress code 
and will not admit students not wearing proper busi
ness attire.
Students need to research the organizations prior 
to the job fair, said Susan Timko, a College of 
Humanities and Social Sciences Career Consultant. 
Also, [they need to] prepare a little blurb about 
themselves to let the employer know what they are 
looking for and what makes them unique. Students 
should also come with several copies of a honed re
sume, pick up business cards and follow up over the 
next couple of days.
Technology has made the job search process easier 
and most employers have open positions listed on 
the internet. It is still a good idea to attend job fairs 
and meet company representatives personally. The 
difference is seeing that person face to face and hav
ing the ability to make an impression, said Starek.
The Technical Opportunities Conference brings 
engineering, computer science, information sys
tems, and other majors focused on technical careers 
together with companies seeking to fulfill their 
high-tech needs. It will be held on Thursday in the 
Wiegand Gymnasium.
The TOC will be open from 10 to 11 am for juniors, 
seniors and graduate students only. From 11 am to
4 pm, however, it will open to the entire student 
body.
The Business Opportunities Conference is tar
geted toward students interested in finance, mar
keting, consulting, manufacturing, and operations. 
This years BOC begins with a Senior Networking 
Reception at the Holiday Inn Select on Thursday 
night from 7 to 9 pm.
The BOC job fair will be on Friday in the Wiegand 
Gymnasium in the University Center. Like the TOC, it 
will open initially with restricted access: From 9 am
to noon, only undergraduate seniors will be able to 
attend. Juniors will be able to attend the conference 
after noon, and it will be open to all Carnegie Mellon 
students from 2 to 4 pm. There will also be informa
tion sessions before the BOC and resume books will 
be handed to every employer.
Students from all majors are advised to attend 
both events. More employers this year are looking 
for a large variety of students. The BOC will like to 
grab the attention of H&SS and CFA majors as well, 
said Qiu.
Other upcoming conferences include the University 
of Pittsburgh Law School Fair tomorrow, from 10 am 
to 2 pm at the William Pitt Union Ballroom. Federal 
Career Day is on November 16 from 10 am to 3 pm, 
and the Creative Careers event is held two months 
from now, on December 6. For those still looking 
for job opportunities after winter break, next se
mester will bring CMUs Employment Opportunities 
Conference on February 9.
Knowing what to say 
during an interview
Making the right impression on an interviewer
by Elizabeth Schwartz
Junior Staffwriter
First impressions are important, especially 
when someones career is on the line. In the 
world of interviews, propriety and presenta
tion are everything.
Interviewers look for people who are ar
ticulate and confident. Research is a necessity 
to achieve articulacy and confidence. Read 
up on possible employers and their company
histories before talking to their recruiters.
Offer a firm handshake, recommends 
Courtney Baum, an Information Systems con
sultant within the College of Humanities and 
Social Sciences division of the Career Center. 
Baum maintains that little things like eye 
contact and body language make a world of 
difference.
Let conversation flow naturally and try to 
make it two-sided. Minimize nervous tenden
cies. Instead of bouncing your .legs up and 
down, try crossing them. The most otherwiseinsignificant habits can determine whether or 
not you are hired.
Baum, who handles interview and resume 
questions on an almost-daily basis, says em
ployers look for openness and the ability to 
communicate in their pool of applicants. 
You always want to be honest, Baum con
cluded, no matter what.
Prospective employees are always carefully 
scrutinized. If you give off even a hint of fake 
veneer, you might just watch your job offer go 
up in smoke.
by Benjamin Hackett
Staffwriter
Its 8:47 am, and youve ar
rived early. Your interview is 
scheduled for 9:00. Taking stock, 
you look yourself over and de
cided that you are prepared. 
Your suit is pressed; your shirt, 
starched; your resume, printed; 
and a wealth of experience and 
knowledge learned. However, in 
todays increasingly specialized 
and competitive job market, are 
those preparations enough?
In behavioral interviews today, 
the common questions still exist. 
A prospective employee will find 
himself faced with general be
havioral questions. Hotjobs.com 
states that the four basic ques
tions are Why did you leave 
your last job?, What are your 
biggest weaknesses?, How 
would you describe yourself?, 
and Do you have any questions 
for me? In this situation, strive 
for thoughtful answers that stray 
from being standard, but do not 
venture into the realm of the 
weird.
In the changing dynamic of 
modern interviews, one must not 
get bogged down in unimportant 
questions. A September 20 ar
ticle on BusinessWeek.com titled 
Stupid Interview Questions, 
outlines some basic rules. Some 
of the general interview questions 
are included here. The overall 
advice is never to get caught in
behavioral traps. Playing to ones 
strengths and giving concise yet 
interesting answers to otherwise 
boring questions are the best 
methods of interview survival.
Increasingly, employers are 
asking unique questions in order 
to unearth a specific type of em
ployee. Be prepared to answer 
questions about the companys 
history, as employers are inter
ested in. hiring employees that 
wish to work for their specific 
company, not just any in a par
ticular field.
Introspective questions are 
more common in todays behav
ioral interviews. One should be 
prepared to comment on how 
they manage, work with, in
teract and advise peers. Some 
companies will ask seemingly 
personal questions to gauge re
actions and determine abilities to 
think on ones feet.
Today, many job applicants 
want information about up
coming interviews. Monster.com, 
Hotjobs.com, and other websites 
have sections dedicated to inter
viewing and proper responses. 
Many publish books that describe 
the most common questions 
asked in interviews. Wherever 
you get your advice  be it from 
Carnegie Mellons Career Center, 
friends and family, or individual 
research  the basic principle 
remains the same: During the in
terview process, preparation and 
confidence will be the qualities 
that shine through.
A polished rsum: the job-hunters key to success
by Pratima Neti
Junior Staffwriter
According to Websters diction
ary, a resume is a brief account 
of ones professional or work ex
perience and qualifications.
Your resume is, more impor
tantly, your first impression on 
any potential employer.
Putting in extra time and effort 
in order to make it stand out is 
time well spent. By following a 
few guidelines, your resume can 
be one that Wont end up in your 
potential employers trash can.
One of the most important 
things you can do about your 
resume is making sure that its 
easy to read.
Employers have to look at hun
dreds of resumes, and if yours is 
unreadable, they wont bother. 
Also, use light-colored paper of 
the standard 8.5"xll" size: any
thing else is simply a nuisance, 
and may find itself at the bottom
of the paper shredder.
Another important point is to 
use a font size between 10- and
Jimi Okelana/Art Staff
14-point. Your name can be writ
ten in a font size up to 32-point, 
but dont go overboard. Make
sure you write down both your 
school and permanent addresses 
so employers can easily find you; 
and, while writing your resume, 
make sure you use action verbs to 
describe your activities.
If possible, describe the results 
of your activities  it helps illus: 
trate your effectiveness. Instead 
of using abbreviations (such as 
CMU), write out phrases.
Most importantly, make sure 
that you have someone check 
your resume before you submit it 
to potential employers. According 
to Renee Starek, a Career Center 
consultant for the Mellon College 
of Science, this is what most stu
dents forget to do.
By having a career counselor 
or your advisor look over your 
resume, you can make sure that 
you havent made any glaring 
mistakes.
After all, since your resume is 
putting your best foot forward, 
you want to make sure that it 
shows you at your best.
Know the job youre applying for when interviewing
by J.T. Trollman
Editor-in-Chief
Everyones suddenly a small 
fish in a very big pond at 
the Business and Technical 
Opportunities Conferences. These 
employers  from the likes of 
IBM, the largest information tech
nology company in the world, to 
General Motors, the worlds larg
est vehicle manufacturer  rep
resent the real world, and with 
each one employing hundreds of 
thousands of en^ployees, it will 
ke quite a bit to get noticed.
The Tartan sat down with the 
Associate Director of Employer 
Relations and Recruiting at 
Carnegie Mellons Career Center, 
Judi Mankuso. With both her pro
fessional history and experience 
in advising hundreds of students 
here at CMU, she was able to 
shed a bit of light on what to ex
pect out of the job process.
The Tartan: What are the most 
common mistakes that you think 
students make during the job 
search process?
Mankuso: [The] first one is 
not using the Career Center. They 
need to use the Career Center.
They need to speak with their 
career consultants; they need to 
have someone look at their re
sume, make suggestions, make 
sure that theyre comfortable 
with it. They need to use all of 
the services available to them to 
sharpen their interview, skills, 
and get their resume and cover 
letter. They need to be aware of 
whos going to be on campus, 
whos going to be conducting in
terviews.
One of the big things is if theyre 
going to be using TartanTrak to 
submit their resumes, they need 
to read the job descriptions. They
need to know what the employer 
is looking for, what type of back
ground, what the security clear
ances may be, all of those. They 
need to do research on the com
pany.
The Tartan: What sort of con
siderations do international stu
dents have to take?
Mankuso: Well, they need to 
have the same desire to have an 
excellent rsum, and make sure 
that theyre well prepared for 
their job search. They also need 
to be aware of what the limitaSee INTERVIEW, page 2*

INTERVIEW, from Cl
tions may be and what the laws 
are, so they should be talking with 
their career consultant to under
stand what the laws are that are 
governing them when they submit 
their rsums.
They need to be aware of which 
employers are hiring students with 
their background and visa status. 
There will be limitations placed 
upon them because of their visa 
status, but they definitely should 
make every effort to find other 
ways of finding employers who 
are willing to talk about that.
The Tartan: Is there anything 
special you should be saying to 
employers at the TOC/BOC?
Mankuso: If I were a student, 
I would probably pull together 
a oneor two-sentence blurb in
cluding their name, their major, 
their graduating year, and what 
theyre looking for. They should 
present that information to them 
as a means of introduction and 
not expect the person behind the 
booth to extract that information
from them by asking them all 
these questions.
... Youre going to have only a 
brief interaction with them [the 
employer], so you want to make 
sure that you convey the message 
of who you are, what youre look
ing for, and how you see yourself 
fitting in with them.
The Tartan: And lastly, whats 
the line between overconfidence 
and being too shy?
Mankuso: Thats a tough one, 
because I think the most impor
tant thing is that applicants be 
themselves.... And if theyre hav
ing concerns about their person
alities, whether theyre too shy 
or theyre overbearing  typi
cally if theyre overbearing they 
dont have a concern about that 
 this is where it gets to a point 
where what they need to do is talk 
with their career consultant.... 
Employers will be hiring you 
based on you  so you dont want 
to put on any fakeness. Theyre 
hiring a person, and they assume 
that that person is who they are as 
they present themselves.
The Tartan can give you 
real work experience that 
no class can offer.
Become ail editor, a 
manager, or just a writer, 
coder, or any number of 
other staff positions and 
gain an advantage over 
your peers when hiring 
day comes.
