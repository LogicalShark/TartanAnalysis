PROCESS OF TREATMENT DUR
ING THE PAST FOUR YEARS.
In the past week of inspection trips 
we have seen iron ore converted into 
pig iron and steel, sand made into 
glass, and farm products put up as 
the 57 varieties. As the old fable 
goes, we have hunted throughout the 
world for something which we have 
in our own back yard. We have here 
at Carnegie one of the greatest brain 
factories ever founded. Let us take 
an inspection trip through it, noting 
the development of the raw material 
(freshmen) into the finished product 
budding engineers. Our trip must 
be a long one, beginning in Septem
ber, 1908, and extending to the pres
ent time.
The shipment of raw material re
ceived in the fall of 1908 was just 
about the average, neither spectacullarly brilliant nor below normal. Of

Our motto:
To make and inspire the home

To enoble and adorn lifes work 
however humble.
These are womans high perrogatives.
Seems to have been deeply consid

the home, as Cupid has been very 
busy this year. A good many things

WHATS WHAT AND HOW.WHAT ARE WE WORTH WHEN 
WE ARE GRADUATED?
Senior! Magic word. It is as if 
we said veteran. Four years of solici
tude for the welfare of the faculty. 
Four years of exposure on the firing 
line at the beanery. Four years of 
passionate longing for holidays and 
of the nocturnal invention of ingeni
ous excuses against the morrow, for 
fear of going stale in the strenuous 
game of acquiring an education. And 
now checkered by honorable scars, 
about to go forth and set the blunder
ing world right. How remote seems 
that palsied day when the arrogant 
Sophs butchered (or attempted to 
butcher) us to make a Roman holiday, 
and we discovered that the real en
trance exams were taken on the ath
letic field and were chiefly in dynam
ics. We began to suspect that prepa
ration should have been sought in a 
______(Continued on Page 6)
This question is inspired by a recent 
utterance of President Hibben, of 
Princeton, who came out with the 
statement, recently, that the services 
of the average student at the institu
tion are worth at graduation $6 per 
week or the magnificent sum of $1.00 
per diem.
The valuation is based upon the fact 
that the training given at that insti
tution being purely academic does not 
equip the student for any particular 
profession but simply gives him a 
store of knowledge of subjects bear
ing upon the ancient classics.
However, we are not particularly 
concerned with the reason, whatever 
it may be. We know that Princeton 
is one of the best schools in the coun
try and that President Hibbens state
ment can be applied to all institutions

course, a large number of culls were 
returned, charges collect, as could be 
expected in stock from so many 
sources.
The entrance examination or in
spection served as a sort of magnetic 
separator, attracting and holding that 
stock which was suitable to the appa
ratus at hand and dropping into the 
tailings that stock which needed more 
treatment.
After this process was complete the 
machinery of the institution was set 
in motion and the task of producing 
engineers was undertaken .
At that time all the machinery of 
the Science School was located in the 
Industries building. The Pattern Shop

of a like character.
The members of the graduating 
class of the Applied Science School 
for 1912, are more concerned with the 
statement as it would apply to a tech
nical graduate.
It seems that nobody of the same 
standing as President Hibben has ven
tured to answer this question as to 
what the services of a technical grad
uate are worth.
As the writer is but a small potato 
compared to President Hibben, no
body, on account of the writers ex
treme obscurity, would think of at
taching any weight to any attempt of 
his to answer the question, as it ap
plies to all graduates of technical 
j colleges, but, as it has been the good

DESOLATION.
The day is cold and dark and som
ber. The sky is hidden. A gray dome 
of clouds can scarcely be seen. The 
atmosphere outside is murky. The 
snow which fell yesterday is already 
black and grimy. Little impalpable 
swirls of dry, dusty snow sweep fit
fully into nothingness. A carriage 
rolls by, swiftly, silently. A solitary 
pedestrian pushes past. He walks 
jerkily as if his limbs were beginning 
to congeal under the influence of the 
icy blast. He is bent toward the wind. 
He disappears in the distance like a 
shadow.
Everything is quiet. The silence is 
gloomy, oppressive. No noise but the 
sad, whistling wind. No color but 
monotonous gray and black. Across 
the dirty, smoky valley the factories 
lie. They seem huddled together as 
if to gain warmth from physical con
tact. The tall, stem-like stacks belch 
forth a volume of black smoke. The 
wind scatters the smoke. The hills 
beyond fade sullenly away into the 
gray clouds above.
Inside it is chilly. The room is dark. 
The fire seems to have lost its usual 
brightness. The deadened light from 
outside does not seem to be able to 
penetrate the dullness within. The 
room is cold. The fire has lost its 
warm glow. I am chilled. The rattle 
of the windows makes me shiver. I 
pull my dressing-gown closer about 
me. Such a day! I sit and think. A 
myriad of unpleasant phantoms infest 
my brain. My head aches. I think. 
I dont want to think. I pick up a 
book and read. The words blur. It is 
dark. My eyes are bad. I throw the 
book down in disgust. I lie down on 
the bed. The blankets are cold and 
I shiver in spite of their protection. 
I cant sleep. I cant rest. What shall 
I do? There is nothing to do.
No friend calls. The dreary after
noon passes slowly, slowly. Dusk be
gins to fall. The gray of the day 
changes, uncertainly, into the deeper 
gray of the evening. I see a shadowy 
lamp-lighter place a bright cold gleam 
into the lifeless head of yon, stiff, 
frozen lamp-post, then disappear into 
the darkness. Lights spring up, one 
by one, in the little black spots of 
houses in the darkening valley. The 
whistles of the factories blow. I see 
the spurts of white steam indistinctly
in the distance. The muffled sharp
ness of the whistles strikes my ear as 
I sit silently watching. Imperceptibly 
night comes. Gray turns into black. 
Lights twinkle in the dark abyss of the 
valley. A shadowy night chill enve
lopes everything.
My room is dark. The fire burns 
blue in my little stove. Shadows 
flicker on tne wall behind me. I am 
getting colder. I am lonely. My heart 
is full and my lips are dumb. The 
world is cold, cold, cold. All is dark
ness. No ray of light, of hope pierces 
the black night. I bury my face in 
my hands. My heart swells until I 
think it will break. My body shakes 
with inward sobbing. The awful truth, 
the terrible fact keeps burning itself 
deeper and deeper into my withering 
brain. I throw my arms toward Heav
en in silent supplication. Life is hope
less! My existence is a spark that 
has been quenched! All is lost! I 
have flunked out!
---------------o---------------
A FOOL THERE WAS.
A fool there was, and he worked all 
night
(Even as you and I),
Trying to get all his lessons right 
(Even as you and I),
He ruined his nerves and he ruined 
his sight;
He lost his health and his appetite; 
But he studied away till broad day
light
(Even as you and I),
Oh, the oil we waste and the toil we 
waste,
As we study to beat the band,
In trying to learn all they say we 
should learn 
And perfectly understand.
The fool, at last, he went to his quiz 
(Even as you and I),
He had tried to acquire all the knowl
edge there is 
(Even as you and I),
But he got just the questions hed hap
pened to miss,
And he swore to himself with a loud 
Gee Whiz,
The faro bank surely has nothing on 
this,
(Even as you and I),
Oh, its honors we get and its 
flunk we get,
Without either reason or rhyme, 
So lets be thankful were sticking yet, 
And play on the red, next time.

The Great Candy Mystery.
Cornelius says:
I won the box of candy fairly and 
was going to take it home to mother 
next June. By insiduous deceit, Buente obtained possession of the same, 
and handled it so roughly that it was 
not fit for , use.
Bill says:
I remember shaking hands with 
Corny. But I dont know a thing 
about the candy, not a thing,except 
that it was good.
Dectective Burns says:
It is the most involved case I ever 
took up. No one respects veracity.
President Taft says:
Since the groundhog saw his 
shadder, I shall be the next Repub
lican President.
What has that to do with the high 
price of butter?
Q. What good is German?
A. It certainly stimulates your 
use of a few French expressions.

MARGARET MORRISON SENIORS
DOMESTIC SCIENCE.
The Influence of the Study of House
hold Economics Upon the Home.
The idea of systematic organization 
is to get the largest amount of work 
done with the least waste and to pro
duce the highest results on a reason
able expense account.
Domestic Science is an effort on the 
part of progressive men and women 
to introduce such principles into the 
conduct of the home; particularly to 
minimize waste and to maximize re
sults obtained. The movement has 
an extremely strong foothold in the 
United States and Canada, possibly 
for the reason that homes of the 
Western continent are far more waste
ful than those of the congested coun
tries of Europe, and hence we need in
telligence and system back of the con
duct of our hearthstones.
Domestic Science aims through sci
entific conduct of the economics of 
the home, to strengthen and broaden 
body and soul, and thereby produce 
the better citizen. It is not only a 
financial but a moral element.
The purchasing of food is very im
portant, that is, buying that quality 
of food that will best sustain the 
thinking and working faculties of the 
family and only by considering the 
composition of foods and their uses 
in the body can we judge what to buy. 
Marketing should not be haphazard 
but should be done according to ac
quired knowledge of cuts of meat, 
grades of flower and sugar, character 
of green vegetables, fruits, etc., and 
of canned or prepared foods.
Food, properly purchased, cooked, 
and served, plays an important part 
in the physical and moral character of 
the home. But Domestic Science does 
not end here, for it concerns itself
with bed-making, care of linen, housecleaning, care of home, cloth and buy
ing of clothes. Through all this runs 
a constant need of having an expense 
account which may be referred to 
when needed.
There is a constant need of fresh 
air and sunshine in a home, cool sleep
ing rooms, frequent ventilation and a 
checking of hot-house heat in con
junction with well-cooked food and 
cheerful surroundings.
Domestic Science fundamentally 
teaches that quality of food, quality 
of serving, quality of body and brain, 
are far superior to quantity.

If the opening game of the basket

be taken as any indication of the com

hard fought, close games before the

Xi Upsilon defeated Sigma Tau in an 
extra period 11 to 9. Humphreys 
played the best game for the victors 
while Holliday was in the game most 
for Sigma Tau.

The Tech Mechanics Club of the 
Applied Industries held an enjoyable 
affair Friday evening, January 25th, in 
the form of a smoker and banquet. 
The spacious Forge shop was thrown 
open to the club, and having built sev
eral forge-fires, the electric lights were 
turned off, giving a pleasing effect to 
the scene. When the music of the 
evening had died away and the fires 
were low, the lights were turned on 
and the hungry Mechanics directed 
their attention to the eats. The eats 
attended to, smokes were passed, after 
which Supt. W. M. Henry suggested 
talk from each one present. Dean 
Connelly was called upon first, and re
sponded with a talk on the progress 
made by the school of Applied In
dustries in the few years of its exis
tence, and of the respect the students 
owe to Mr. Carnegie for his interest 
in his boys, as he calls them. Mr. 
Taylor, of the Forge, followed with 
the students version of Good Night. 
Mr. Hepburn, of the Machine Shop, 
spoke of the equipment in his depart
ment, and of the opportunities which 
await the graduate mechanic. Mr. W. 
S. Williams, of the Crucible Steel Co., 
a student of the Night School, spoke 
impressively of the present and future 
need of a technical trained mechanic.
Mr. R. A. Nicholson, of the Night 
School, and others responded in turn, 
and when the janitor appeared about 
the eleventh hour it was considered 
gentle hint to disperse. Each one 
present expressed his desire to see 
the club flourish, not alone the remain
der of this year, but in years to come.

Thistle appears, and no mention is 
made of them.
All material of any nature must be 
turned in by February 15 if it is to be 
published. The editors, printers and 
engravers will require six weeks to 
publish the book, and it is absolutely 
necessary that the book be ready for 
distribution the first week in April.
No Extra Thistles Printed.
There will not be any more Thistles 
published than there are subscriptions 
for them. Some students have the 
idea that they will be able to buy a 
Thistle after they are published, but 
the Editors must know the exact num
ber to order, and no allowance will 
be made for those who might get one 
later.
All subscriptions must be made by 
February 15. None accepted later.
In this issue of the Tartan, Manager 
Manker announces the Baseball 
Schedule for the coming season. Mr. 
Manker has arranged an exception
ally good schedule and many very 
strong teams will be met.
With the coming of the baseball 
season it is earnestly desired that all 
the men who have any ability along 
this line come out for the team. Let 
them not only come out to the first 
practices, but stick for the full sesson. The only way that we can have 
a really successful season, is for every 
man in the school to get busy and 
push. If you have no playing ability 
yourself, see that every man yow 
know, who does have that ability ia 
out for practice.
At the first call for indoor practice 
there is usually a large squad out 
but as the season progresses it grad
ually diminishes . We cannot have a 
good Varsity team without a good 
scrub team and it is up to every fellow 
who can hold a baseball to get out 
and work. If you do not happen to 
make the Varsity team, you will at 
least have the satisfaction of knowing 
that you yourself have helped to make 
players out of the men who do make 
it, and that you are really doing some
thing for your school. Everybody 
boost and let us make this season the 
biggest ever in the baseball line.
course, this game is still in the distant 
future but the desire for the clash is 
in the present. To those who have 
never seen this annual combat we 
might say that it is played in June 
during Senior week and after all ex
ams are over and passed (?). It ap
parently is a game between two 
bunches of fellers, for the dignity 
and authority of the faculty is un
recognized. The Seniors are quick to 
criticize any peculiar stride or field
ing methods of their opponents, and 
the Faculty representatives retaliate 
in kind. Naturally, the instructors 
who are most lavish with Rs and Fs

NOTICE.
For the Fourth Year and Fifth Year 
Night Men of the Science and 
Design Schools.
Your presence at the Junior Prom 
is as much, if not more desired than 
the day men. The day men want to 
get acquainted with you and show 
you what a good time is. Many of 
your own alumni will be there, and
the night of February 16th will be a 
good chance for you to meet old 
friends and make new ones.
Just because you have no repre
sentative on the committee dont think 
that you are out of it. The committee 
is thinking about other than the finan
cial end of the affair. Get a day man 
to fill out your program for you, if 
you do not have the time yourself. 
Break over from the grind and enjoy 
yourself for one evening at least.

we in turn, undertook the spartan con

planting the love of virtue with knee

moved by the plaintive wail of the

deserted rooms, where our ingenious

computing the stresses and strains of 
the original Adam raised to the nth

has topped our adventurous career 
w'ith the awful distinction of making 
the Class of 1912 the pioneers at Car

parlors and uncharted realm of the 
honor system. No longer can we look 
upon our neighbors chaste blend of 
fact and fiction in exams to lust after 
it. Our moral water wings have been 
removed and we must manfully keep 
ourselves upon the somewhat unstable 
surface of honesty without adventiti
ous aids. It is obvious that herein j 
looms largely an opportunity to capij 
talize each letter of our name in the 
annals of the school, and per contra, : 
if we allow the load of responsibility 
to dislocate our moral backbones, the

hale will hardly be called perfume by 
those who follow us.
If we commit the grievous error of 1 
assuming that because the law has j 
been delivered into our hands we can ! 
despitefully use it with impunity, we 
will need a commodious cyclone cellar

were situated as they now are but 
their capacity was somewhat smaller. 
The Materials, the Electrical and the 
Physics laboratories occupied wings 
of the buildings. The Mathematics 
and Mechanics departments occupied 
rooms above the administration of
fices, while the English treatment was 
administered in small rooms. which 
have since been turned into the draw
ing room on the second floor of the 
Design School. The Refining estab
lishment, known as the Chemistry de
partment, was on the third floor. Let 
us call it the Refining establishment 
because here most of the weeding out 
was done as per Foreman James. 
What the Chemistry machine didnt 
throw out the Mathematics machine 
did and from all reports they are 
still at it.
In this factory you will notice that 
the stock is not conveyed from one 
machine to another but is allowed to 
travel on its own power. Yes, somer 
times that power gives out or they 
go astray as young stock will. A 
strict personal examination by Gen
eral Superintendent Leete usually re
charges their batteries sufficiently to 
carry them through a whole semester 
without another breakdown. In case 
that fails they are put through the 
tempering process, being subjected to 
a heated lecture and then plunged 
into a cold probation bath.
But to return to the factory as it 
stood in 1908. The cooling yard or 
athletic field was then situated at the 
entrance to Schenley Park, where, 
Forbes Field now stands. Cooling 
yard is a good name for it because 
the surplus energy is dissipated there. 
Emphasis on the surplus. The differ
ent foremen of the plant have differ
ent ideas as to what is surplus.
This Athletic Field finally fell into 
the hands of another concern and the 
stock was separated from its small 
charge to fix up the one now in use.
At that time the plant was being ex
tended and improvedwhat is now 
known as the Science building was 
under construction.
All the stock, which successfully 
passed through the first years treat
ment was put out to season for three 
months. Of course, some deserved 
special treatment and were put 
through a tutoring process. This con
sisted of a small intellectual addition 
and a large cash reduction. As the 
foremen personally conducted both 
operations, the process was nearly al
ways successful.
In the second year the several dif
ferent kinds of material were sorted 
and started through their own special 
processes. The Electrical section 
were treated with volts, ohms, and 
amperes and polished off with a few 
gausses. The Mechanicals were put 
through a machine stamped all over 
with the marks Made in Germany. 
The Civils were totally submerged in 
a tangled mass of concrete and struc
tural work and were only seen in the 
open air on Sundays.
These several treatments and sea
sonings have brought the material to 
its present state where it awaits the 
finishing pass.
Plans are being made in the plant 
for placing in operation the Follows
system. Each engineer turned out is 
to be appropriately labeled with sev
eral significant letters to facilitate the 
labors of Mr. Fields as sales agent.

(Continued from Page 1) 
fortune of the writer as a member of 
this graduating class to have been 
brought into intimate contact with 
most of the its members for the past 
four years he is, in a position, by 
being familiar with the characteristics 
of each member, to form some opinion 
as to the value of his services at grad
uation.
The opinion of the writer is that the 
services of each member of the Senior 
class are going to be worth consider
ably more than $6 a week at gradu
ation. Why? Because of the kind of 
men who are graduating.
Take the Senior Mechanical class, 
for instance. Such a hardworking 
earnest and able body of mild man
nered and quiet gentlemen has rarely 
been seen.
Here we have talent from all over 
the United States; one hails from Cal
ifornia, another from a hustling lake 
city of New York State; another from 
the progressive county of Huron, O., 
another from the land o heathen.
Most of the talent is recruited, how
ever, from the great commonwealth 
of Pennsylvania. One hails from the 
banks of the beautiful Shenarigo river, 
another from the cradle of the oil in
dustry, and still another from that 
hustling little town on the Allegheny 
river, at which George Washington 
stopped while journeying through 
these parts.
They are the kind of men whose 
services will be in demand at gradua
tion.
Already some have been made the 
recipients of quite a number of flat
tering ffers from various firms.
One of these gentlemen received an 
offer recently to take complete charge 
of a peanut roasting stand involving 
the responsibility of looking after the 
prime mover of same. This gentle
man is considering the matter favor
ably. He says, he wishes he had taken 
the peanut roasting stand prime mover 
course instead of the course he did 
take.
In keeping with their progressive 
characteristics, they have decided to 
devote a considerable part of this sem
ester to absolutely original research 
work and no doubt, will, at the con
clusion of same make some very valu
able contributions to science.
The gentleman who received the 
peanut offer will make a special study 
of condensers with a view to applying 
same to exhaust of peanut engine. He 
will also determine how many pea
nuts oer horsepower can be roasted. 
He says hes after the Nobel Prize.
Another is going to do some re
search work in refrigeration with a 
view to accepting a position, vending 
ice cream cones. While this informa
tion may be regarded in the light of 
a digression from the subject in hand, 
still it will serve to show in a small 
way, the spirit of progressiveness that 
permeates the Senior Mechanical class. 
Such progressiveness and earnest 
pursuit after knowledge one rarely 
seen. For instance, last semester, 
several of these gentlemen devoted a
considerable period to determining 
the efficacy of giving a person an elec
tric shock before he took a drink at 
the cooler. The idea was that water 
was more efficacious to the system 
when the drinking of it was preceded 
by giving the system an electric 
shock. It is unfortunate, however, 
that the experiment should be so pro
ductive of language unfit for print 
which language the objects of experi
mentation indulged in.
Still another example of their inde
fatigable pursuit after knowledge. 
Several decided one day to make a 
study of the results of impact. The 
experiment consisted in placing a 
standard brick in a cardboard box on 
pavement leading to the Applied In
dustries. It was found after consid
erable data had been collected and an 
average taken that it was actually 
the toe of the kicker and not the brick 
that suffered. It was noticed that each 
kicker showed no appreciation of the 
real value of the experiment, but in
dulged in sundry ejaculations which 
conveyed to the hearers a rather ex
tensive knowledge of the English lan
guage. Even when they tested the 
Directors automobile by taking an 
extensive ride in it, Mr. Weidlein 
said things that were not fit for a 
church social. All this goes to show 
the difficulties they have encountered 
and overcome in the pursuit of knowl
edge.
Such is the stamp of man in the 
Applied Science graduating class of
1912. He is the kind of man whose 
services at graduation will command 
more than $6 per week.

PITT WINS POOR GAME.
Both Teams Fail to Shine.
The Varsity met the University of 
Pittsburgh basketball team in the 
Field House last Friday for the first 
game of the annual series of three. 
The game was far from being satis
factory to either side, although the 
visitors won by a score of 24 to 17. 
Both teams played a loose game, with 
poor team work and extraordinarily 
bad shooting.
The Pitt team was accompanied by 
a large number of rooters, and the 
Carnegie Tech men were out in force, 
filling the gallery and all of the avail
able space outside of the boundary 
lines. Several hundred chairs and a 
number of benches were occupied by 
the fair contingent, while their escorts 
made themselves comfortable on the 
piano, apparatus, andin a few in
stanceson the floor. The school 
band entertained the spectators be
tween halves with stirring music, 
causing many a fair one to wish for 
permission to get up and trip one light 
fantastic.
Three minutes passed from the time 
of the sound of the whistle until H. 
Campbell made the first goal of the 
game. Colvin missed one foul and
H. Campbell raised the score two 
points on as many free throws. Then 
Colvin secured a basket on his second 
shot from the foul line, after five min
utes of play. In this and subsequent 
parts of the first half, both teams 
missed many good chances at the basget, and possession of the ball was 
exchanged numerous times. Keltz se
cured the first field goal for the Plaid 
team after about ten minutes of play, 
and Colvin made the only other one 
of the first half shortly afterward. 
Pitt showed one flash of speed in this 
period in which they got three field 
goals, but they were easily headed 
before the whistle blew.
In the second half, neither team 
displayed any improvement in form 
until some ten or twelve minutes had 
passed. Keltz hurt his bad ankle again 
and, after trying to stick it out, was 
withdrawn. Colvin was sent to the 
pivot position and Capt. Williams 
went into the game at his place for
ward. This gave the Skibos new en
thusiasm and they made things hustle 
our way for a short space. Colvin 
and Williams each made a basket in 
close succession, before the Blue and 
Gold woke up. Then ensued some 
basketball that gave the fans a chance 
to see what both teams were capable 
of doing. But, alas, it did not last! 
The half ended as badly as it had be
gun.
Colvin, Kesselman and Williams did 
what little starring was done. The 
second named was the only real play
er in the game and showed lots of 
nerve, playing after being hurt badly. 
Coupled with Pitts poor playing, he 
was our main defence. Frishman and
H. Campbell showed flashes of abil
ity.

CUPID AT THE M. M. C. S.
Cupid, forlorn and weary, bearing an 
idle bow,
Was walking up and down the earth, 
and going to and fro,
Vainly he sought for victims, but no 
one he could find,
A hapless goal of love, with bandaged 
eyes and blind!
Alack! he quoth, the modern 
world is not the place for me! 
Why names no longer honored, out
side of Arcady,
But Arcadys a land of dreams, a
faint, forgotten shore,
And here I roam through city streets, 
midst scenes that I abhor.
On every side are suffragettes, en
cased in triple plate;
Twould take at least a Gatling gun 
their hearts to penetrate.
They pluck my arrows from their
flesh, not even turning pale, 
Then hurry off to make a speech 
about the useless male.
The clubs are filled with bachelors 
who only care to smoke,
And when I let an arrow 'fly they
treat it as a joke.
I cannot pierce such frozen hearts 
here Cupid gave a sob,
"My occupations gone, he wailed, 
Id best give up my job.
At last, while wandering in despair, he 
came to Schenley Park,
And there he wrested neath a tree 
Whats that? Hark, hark ,the 
lark!
But no, Miss Stoners voice it was, 
so sweet and true and strong; 
Come girls, she cried in accents 
clear, lets sing the womans 
song!
From out the open windows of a 
building standing near,
It swelled, this wave of melody, and 
broke on Cupids ear.
In ecstacy he started up, surely he 
heard his name!
Loves sweetest joys were the 
words that on the breezes came.
Aflame with hope he caught his bow 
and darted in the door;
Lightly he sprang from stair to stair 
and reached the topmost floor. 
Unseen by all the Faculty he slipped 
inside the Gym,
Where happy maidens sang and 
danced, quite unaware of him.
He loosed a dart; his victim fell; he 
saw her sweet distress,
But never mind, my dear, quoth 
he, my wounds bring happi
ness!
And then, he scampered through the 
hall, as quiet as a mouse,
And laughed in triumph when he 
crossed the portals of The 
House.
For there stood maidens clad in pink, 
always Loves proper hue 
Learning to set a table, to fry and 
bake and stew.
The time was ripe, he had no doubt, 
his darts fell thick and fast;
A field for his endeavor he knew hed 
found at last.
The tap of the stenographer, the hum 
of the machine,
Where ever Cupid turned his steps he 
found a busy scene;
Designing, sewing, typing,all those 
maidens were prepared 
To welcome Cupids coming, as 
through the halls he fared.
No more I sigh for Arcady,fair 
land of ancient fame,
A new Arcadia Ive foundM. M. C.
S. its name!
My sorrows now are over past; I need 
no farther roam,
For here my name is honored, and 
here Ive found a Home!

Impossible! ce mot nest pas francois.This is the secretarials motto.
A JOY RIDE.
One cold morning we were rescued 
from the Icy Trail by a Slow Train 
Through (?) Woodlawn Avenue. 
Little cared we for time or the fact 
that it took us just one-half hour to 
run one square.
It was quite an unusual affair,es
pecially to have happened in the city 
in that the poor conductor of our 
Special Car had to sweep from the 
track the snowy blanket before we 
could proceed.
The manner of procedure proved to 
be quite a fatal one to a few of our 
curious passengers who wished to see 
ahead, and who will always have a 
fond recollection of the diresome 
jerks.
But, nevertheless, we all piled off 
and entered school in a whirl of gig
gles as we had a perfectly good excuse 
to ease our guilty consciences.---------o---------

A grand panic, due to the blasting, 
has been averted many times within 
the last few weeks in the M. M. C. S. 
The first blast proved a shock, the 
second was a hair-raising experience, 
the third caused a tingling sensation 
and an irresistable feeling of having 
to fly, the fourthbut the fourth never 
came, so the panic was averted.* * *

THE SECRETARIAL STUDENTS 
MUTUAL SERVICE COM
MITTEE.
The Secretarial Girls have elected 
a committee of three whichmay be 
called a Mutual Service Committee 
for themselves. The three girls are 
Lucinda Rinard, Clara Jayme and 
Helen Boyd. Their duties are to see 
to any social affairs that may come 
up, such as calling on a Secretarial 
girl who may be confined to her home 
on account of illness, or to present 
some new idea to the class, or to sug
gest ways and means of helping one 
another in their work and play of life.
It is a thing that will bind the girls 
together as a whole and it will enable 
them to work together as .a unit. Ev
eryone knows how busy the Secre
tarial girls are, and that if there is not 
a committee of this kind often times 
matters of interest and importance 
will go by unnoticed, and then be re
gretted afterwards.
It is to be hoped that the other 
divisions of the Senior class will each 
form such a committee and these com
mittees interchange their ideas from 
time to time so as to bring about a 
better understanding between all the 
parts of the whole.
