Applicant pool continues to grow

Tartan Webmaster
With the application process for the 
1999-2000 school year two months 
from completion, the Office of Admis
sions has already received a record 
number of applications for next year.
As of last Friday the office had re
ceived 13,473 applications. Were see
ing a phenomenon, and that is more 
students are 
applying than 
ever before, 
said Michael 
Steidel, direc
tor of Admis
sions. More 
students are 
going on to col
leges and [they] 
are applying to 
more colleges 
as well.
Steidel at
tributed the in
crease in appli
cations to the 
increasing na
tional and in
tern ational 
reputation of 
CMU. Appli
cations from 
the Pennsylva
nia area have 
been stagnant, 
but applica
tions from the
South, West, and foreign countries are 
up. We also have lots of boarding school 
students applying, as we have been in
creasingly trying to get those kind of 
schools to visit, he said.
For the third year in a row, the Uni
versity administration decided that the 
target size for the incoming class should 
be 1,280 students. Admissions faced criti
cism in 1996 when the entering class 
was over capacity by 104 students.
Steidel and William Elliott, vice presi
dent for Enrollment, said that the two 
departments have worked together to 
better estimate what the response will 
be from accepted applicants.
According to Steidel, Admissions 
uses models based on previous years 
to predict how many students will 
respond to acceptances. For example,

Senators report on 
treasurers actions
By ANNE RAY
Dossier Literary Editor
When Student Senates Committee to 
Investigate the Actions of the Treasurer 
presented its final report in a session 
last Thursday, one assertion was clear
 The Student Body Treasurers ac
tions were done without malice or ill 
intent. What the report does not make 
clear, however, is the method of investi
gation, or how sources were contacted.
The Committee, formed a month 
ago to investigate the actions of the 
current Treasurer, senior electrical 
and computer engineering major 
Keith Rothschild, was formed as the 
result of allegations of wrongdoing 
on Rothschilds part. The Committees 
final report states that it focuses 
on information gleaned through the 
examination of six incidents 
involving eight different student orga
nizations. It also states that 
the Committee believes many of 
Rothschilds positive interactions 
with student organizations went unre
ported. No immediate action will 
come of this report  the Committee 
feels that the gravity of these charges 
neither demand nor. warrant action by 
Student Government.
During the Thursday meeting, Senate 
accepted the report, after much dis
cussion to clarify that no action will be 
taken. Several senators, as well as
Rothschild himself, raised points of con
tention with the report. The report out
lines specific problems with Rothschilds 
conduct, but does not state which stu
dent organizations were contacted for 
information, or explain how the Com
mittee gleaned its information.
In the Thursday meeting, Rothschild 
brought up the fact that he had never 
been contacted by the Committee to dis
cuss the allegations. He also noted a lack 
of evidence, and a lack of knowledge 
about the powers necessary for the Trea
surer to conduct business properly, such 
as having a meeting with a student 
organization under investigation. The 
Committee stated in its report that de
manding this type of meeting is unrea
sonable. Rothschild pointed out that the 
Constitution grants the Treasurer the 
power to freeze a student organizations 
budget, but not to demand a meeting.
The Committee had a very compli
cated task, said Rothschild. I felt that 
in order to do justice, more explanation 
was needed.
Mike Strauss, a senior computer sci
ence major and chair of the Committee, 
stressed the need to protect the confi
dentiality of the organizations involved.
We got a large amount of informa
tion, said Strauss. Based on that infor
mation, we made a number of conclu
sions any reasonable and prudent per
son would have made. Things are exCalenl nll oumd16umuv geIl F
President speaks to college students about Social Security
By ISH HARSHAWAT
Tartan News Editor
College students dont often have the 
chance to discuss issues of national 
importance with the President of 
the United States.
Last Wednesday the Heinz School 
and the Social Security Administration 
broadcast a White House Forum 
in which President Clinton addressed 
college students from around the coun
try on Social Security policy. 
He outlined his thoughts on the 
matter and answered questions from 
the audience.
More young people, in the 1980s be
lieved in UFOs than they believed in
Social Security, said Clinton, citing 
a study.
Currently, Washington is in discus
sion over the future of Social Security 
benefits. The debate is just how much 
needs to be done, said Dan Majewski, 
public affairs specialist for the Social 
Security Administration, who helped 
organize the broadcast.
Clinton spoke to students about his 
proposed plan, referring frequently to 
the strength of the economy and the 
current and projected budget surpluses. 
His proposal includes transferring $2.8 
trillion, or 62 percent, of the surpluses 
over the next 15 years to the Social 
Security system. Social Security taxes 
go to a trust fund. One of the current
debates is about how the trust fund 
should be invested.
Clinton advocates investing a portion 
of the trust fund into the private sector. 
There are ups and downs to that. There 
is a risk factor, but also a higher rate of 
return, said Majewski.
As of now, Social Security can pay full 
benefits until 2032. According to 
Majewski, if policy continues in the cur
rent manner, only 75 percent of benefits 
will be paid by then. He said that in 
order to prevent taking unpopular mea
sures in the future, like raising taxes or 
cutting benefits, it is necessary to make 
changes to the system now.
Other options being discussed include 
paying down the national debt, cutting
taxes, or increasing spending on pro
grams such as education.
According to Majewski, 43 people at
tended the teleconference. The audience 
included graduate students, members 
of the American Association of Retired 
Persons, and members of the press. 
We were a little disappointed by the 
number of students that attended, he 
said. We didnt have much notice get
ting it together.
My experience with my students [sug
gests] the unanimous reaction is that 
[Social Security] wont be there for us, 
said Ben Fischer, professor of public 
service at the Heinz School. He added 
that students seem to be non-political, 
as evidenced by their low voter turnout.
For Social Security ... depending on 
what policies are adopted, students will 
be substantially affected throughout 
their whole lives in terms of how much. 
tax they pay to support others social! 
security payments, as well as how much 
they will have in retirement when they 
leave the labor force, said Mark Kamlet, 
dean of the Heinz School.
Majewski also said that Social Secu
rity is important to young people 
because, in addition to retirement 
benefits, Social Security goes towards 
disability and survivors benefits. 
Its important for college students to 
read the proposals out there and let 
their congressmen know what they 
think, he said.
CMU professor receives honors 
from White House for research
By SRINlVAS PULLELA
Tartan Staffwriter
On February 10, Marlene 
Behrmann, professor of psychol
ogy at CMU, was presented 
the Presidential Early Career 
Award for Scientists and 
Engineers (PECASE) for her re
search in the area of 
cognitive neuroscience.
The PECASE is the 
highest honor be
stowed by the U.S. gov
ernment on outstand
ing scientists and en
gineers beginning their 
independent careers.
The PECASE, which 
was presented to 
Behrmann in a White 
House ceremony, includes five 
years of research funding sup
port from the National Institutes 
of Health.
Her work focuses on the cogni
tive and neural mechanisms 
that underlie visual processing, 
the stage that follows 
perception. Once the informa
tion from the retina is received by 
the brain, the question is,
how do we interpret it? 
said Behrmann.
Behrmann had previously re
ceived the American Psychologi
cal Association Early Career 
Award in Neuropsychology in 
1998, but did not expect being 
selected for the PECASE. It was 
surprising because I hadnt apIt was surprising because I 
hadn't applied for it, so it kind 
of came out of the blue. 
 Marlene Behrmann 
Psychology professor
plied for it, so it kind of came out 
of the blue, said Behrmann.
Of the 60 PECASE recipients 
this year, Behrmann was the only 
one cited for work in the area of 
visual cognition. I thought it was 
incredibly exciting, she said. Cer
tainly this kind of science has gen
erally not been recognized, but in 
fact, weve made significant 
progress over the last decade.
Behrmann was commended 
for her contributions to improv
ing the understanding of psy
chological and neural mecha
nisms of visual cognition and 
the effects of brain injury and 
rehabilitation interventions on 
these mechanisms.
According to Behrmann, hu
mans employ visual 
processing in a 
number of daily 
tasks. For example, 
when a person sees 
someones head, he 
or she knows that 
there is a person 
connected to the 
head, even if the 
^j persons body is 
blocked from sight. 
Most of Behrmanns work 
involves studying adults who 
have circumcised lesions in the 
cortico-visual system. These 
people are often able to see 
things in their visual fields, but 
are unable to process them.
Behrmann joined the 
CMU faculty after earning 
her PhD in speech pathology

Kosovo peace talks 
bring little progress
RAMBOUILLET, France (AP)Ne
gotiations at the Kosovo peace talks 
stretched beyond a noon deadline Sat
urday as Western nations tried to sal
vage a deal with a defiant Yugoslav 
president and avoid resorting to NATO 
missiles and bombs.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright 
met with the entire Albanian delega
tion and separately with four Serb 
negotiators Saturday in the fourth-century chateau where talks were 
being held.
British Foreign Secretary Robin 
Cook was also meeting with Serbian 
President Milan Milutinovic.
State Department spokesman James 
P. Rubin dismissed reports that 
Albright and European mediators had 
agreed to delay the deadline until 
Monday. But he did not say when the 
talks might end.
Rubin indicated Serb resistance to a 
proposal to station peacekeepers in 
Kosovo could be weakening. They are 
not only talking about a political settle
ment, he said.
That Serbs were willing to discuss 
the peacekeepers could indicate that 
the United States and the allies might 
find a way to compromise their differ
ences with Milutinovic on this explo
sive issue. He has refused to permit 
about 30,000 troops, including about 
4,000 Americans, to take up positions 
in Kosovo.
We are determined not to let the 
political and military elements of this 
be separated, Rubin said.
In an interview with Associated 
Press Television News, Yugoslav 
Deputy Premier Vuk Draskovic said 
the fact that talks were still going on 
is a good signal, which tells us there 
is hope for a political settlement. The 
bombing of Yugoslavia would only 
strengthen anti-American and antiEuropean forces, and Americans can
not understand this.
A Serbian source close to the 
talks, who spoke on the condition of 
anonymity, described the atmosphere 
inside the chateau as better than 
in recent days, and said the Serb del
egation was studying a number of pa
pers. He was unclear on whether the
Serb side would sign or not, and hinted 
at an extension.
Albright arrived in France Satur
day in an 11th hour effort to coax 
Serbs and Kosovo Albanians to sign a 
three-year interim accord giving the 
southern Serbian province wide au
tonomy backed by the military force.
In addition to the disagreement over 
foreign troops, the official news agency 
Tanjug reported that the main ob
stacle to the political agreement was 
ethnic Albanian insistence on a refer
endum on independence at the end of 
the three-year interim period.
The military guarantee is key to 
any political agreement between the 
Serbs and the ethnic Albanians, who 
make up more than 90 percent of 
Kosovos 2 million inhabitants. An 
estimated 2,000 people have been 
killed in a year of conflict between 
Serb security forces and the Kosovo 
Liberation Army.
President Clinton blamed the Serbs 
for the failure of the talks so far 
and said Friday that they would be 
held accountable.
The proposed peace plan grants 
Kosovo virtual self-rule, calls for most 
Serbian security troops to withdraw 
from the region, and demands the dis
arming of ethnic Albanian rebels. 
But it keeps the province within 
Yugoslav borders.
In Yugoslavia, international monitors 
withdrewfrom an area ofwestem Kosovo 
afterresidentshuiledrocksandfirecrackers in a protest against their presence.
In other signs of rising tensions, 
large numbers of people took buses 
from Kosovos capital back to their 
villages Saturday, many saying 
Pristina was too dangerous. In 
Belgrade, Western government work
ers and their families continued to 
leave the Yugoslav capital.
Fighting also broke out Saturday 
near the northern Kosovo town of 
Podujevo, 25 miles north of Pristina.
The first targets in a NATO attack 
would likely be Serb air defenses and 
radar facilities, probably struck by 
Tomahawk missiles fired from U.S. 
warships. Follow-up attacks could tar
get command centers and barracks.
Film critic dies in 
Chicago hospital
CHICAGO (AP)  Film critic Gene 
Siskel, known for the thumbs-up and 
thumbs-down reviews he and Roger 
Ebert shared on their popular TV show, 
died Saturday. He was 53.
Siskel had surgery in May to remove a 
growth from his brain, but returned to 
the syndicated television show Siskel & 
Ebert soon afterward. He announced 
earlier this month he was taking time off 
from that show to spend time recuperat
ing from the surgery.
He died at Evanston Hospital near 
Chicago, surrounded by his family.
Siskel worked for the Chicago Tribune 
and also did reviews for CBS This Morn
ing and WBBM-TV in Chicago.
Siskel graduated from Yale Univer
sity in 1967. He joined the Tribune in 
1969. He and Ebert began their partner
ship in 1975 with the public television 
program Sneak Previews. They left the 
program in 1982, when their show went 
into syndication.
He is survived by his wife, Marlene, 
two daughters, and a son.
Citizens move to 
stop dog killings
TORONTO (AP)  Dog-shooting day 
comes three or four times a year. When 
stray dogs become too numerous and 
pesky in remote Inuit villages of north
ern Quebec, men fan out with their rifles 
to solve the problem at close range.
For the Inuit people, the longstanding 
practice makes good sense. The stray 
dogs become malnourished and on occa
sion attack humans.
But the tradition of dog-shooting day 
has come under scrutiny in the rest of 
Canada in recent weeks after two nonInuit schoolteachers in the village of 
Kangirsuk made use of the Internet to 
appeal for help in saving some of the 
local strays.
It is extremely difficult to focus on 
these dog-shooting days, as you can see 
the men luring the dogs closer towards 
them by calling out to them, wrote 
Wendy Roberts. The dogs come will
ingly and are shot.
The World Society for the Protection 
of Animals responded to the appeal by 
arranging for six of the threatened dogs 
to be airlifted from Kangirsuk to 
Montreal, 1,000 miles to the south.
But the flight, even after a discount 
from regional airline First Air, cost about 
$1,500, too much for the animal protec
tion groups to consider repeating it on a 
regular basis.
Instead, the groups are trying to raise 
funds to send veterinarians up to 
Kangirsuk and other Inuit villages each 
year to spay and neuter the stray dogs, 
easing the overpopulation problem with
out the need for shootings.
Traditionally, dogs were essential to 
the Inuit way of life as sled-pullers, but 
that role has been largely supplanted by 
snowmobiles.
Kangirsuks mayor, George Haukai, 
gave approval for the airlift rescue, 
but he also defended the practice of 
shooting dogs.
The dog population grows very rap
idly, he told the Canadian Broadcasting 
Corporation. Weve had a couple of people 
attacked by dogs  two children.
While the Montreal SPCA tries to re
cruit a veterinarian to fly north this 
summer, it also is recruiting dog-lovers 
to adopt the six refugees from Kangirsuk.
Suspect in African 
genocide gives up
ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) - A former 
mayor indicted for involvement in the 
1994 genocide in Rwanda has surren
dered to South African authorities, the 
U.N. tribunal investigating the slaugh
ter said Saturday.
Ignace Bagilishema, ex-mayor of 
Mabanza in Kibuye prefecture, surren
dered in Pretoria on Thursday and was 
expected to be turned over to the Inter
national Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda 
later Saturday, said acting chief pros
ecutor Othman Chande.
His arrest follows that of Casimir 
Bizimungu, a former Rwandan health 
and foreign affairs minister who was 
seized Tuesday in the Kenyan capital of 
Nairobi, and Eliezer Niyitegeka, a former 
Rwandan information minister arrested 
February 9 in Nairobi.
Bizimungu was health minister in 
1994 and is considered to be one of the 
main ideological leaders behind the government-orchestrated slaughter of more 
than 500,000 people  mostly minority 
Tutsis and politically moderate Hutus.
His surrender brings to 36 the number 
of suspects in custody. Two defendants 
have pleaded guilty to genocide, and a 
third has been convicted on the same 
charge and has been sentenced to life in 
prison, the tribunals harshest penalty.
Clinton prioritizes 
education reform
WASHINGTON (AP)  Improving 
Americas schools should be a national 
priority, President Clinton said today, 
dismissing criticism that education 
strictly is a local matter.
In his weekly radio address, Clinton 
urged Congress to embrace his propos
als to reduce class size, modernize school 
buildings, improve teacher quality, and 
make schools accountable for results. 
Clinton said his proposals were 
based on proven experience. Theyre 
common sense. We have to make them 
common practice in every school district 
in America.
Democrats and Republicans alike have 
seized on education as a top political 
priority but they differ in their approach. 
A House Republican bill aims to give 
local schools and states more control 
and flexibility.
Acknowledging differences, Clinton 
said, Now, some in Congress believe 
the national government has no busi
ness helping communities to. improve 
their schools.
But I think strengthening education 
is a national priority, he said.
Clinton is calling on schools to provide 
report cards on their own performance 
to parents, end social promotion, invest 
more in summer and after-school pro
grams, and adopt and enforce disciplin
ary codes.
Clinton strived to cast his proposals as 
grassroots-based and not instructions 
trickling down from the capital.
As both a former governor and a par
ent, I know the greatest innovations in 
education do not start in Washington, 
he said. They start in local schools and 
school districts, in community councils 
and parent-teacher groups.
With the nations governors gathering 
in Washington this weekend, he noted 
that Delaware is already putting an end 
to social promotion, Pennsylvania is im
proving school safety, and North 
Carolina has been working to improve 
teacher quality.
As I have said many times, every 
problem in education in America has 
been solved somewhere, by somebody, 
in America, Clinton said. The trick is 
helping more communities to put those 
proven solutions to work in their own 
public schools. I believe the national 
government has an obligation to help 
them do that.
Pennsylvania chemical explosion kills several workers
ALLENTOWN, Penn. (AP)  
Rescue workers searching 
through tons of rubble and twisted 
steel today discovered the bodies 
of five people killed in an explo
sion that leveled a chemical pro
cessing plant.
The Friday night blast at 
the Concept Sciences Inc. 
facility at the Lehigh Valley 
Industrial Park  about three 
miles southwest of Allentown 
and 50 miles north of 
Philadelphia  could be felt 
miles away and left at least 13 
others injured.
Lehigh County Coroner Scott 
Grimm said that the dead were 
among seven people in the build
ing at the time of the explosion. 
Two others were pulled from the 
debris, including one who was in 
critical condition. The condition 
of the other was not known.
Authorities believed the explo
sion was triggered during the dis
tillation of the volatile chemical 
hydroxylamine, a substance used 
by the company for processing 
salt in water heaters, said John 
Conklin, director of the Lehigh 
County Emergency Management
Office. They also believed another 
chemicalpotassium hydroxide
 was involved in the explosion.
The explosion created a fourfoot crater in the building and 
blew out 25-foot high concrete 
wails and caused two stories of 
concrete ceiling to collapse.
The morning light showed just 
how devastating the explosion 
was: Twisted steel and chunks of 
concrete littered the area for at 
least 100 yards in each direction 
and only parts of the steel frame
work stood; three other adjacent 
buildings were damaged, with
windows blown out and siding 
torn from the structures. Cars in 
an adjacent parking lot were cov
ered in rubble.
Rescue crews in protective air 
masks and clothing searched all 
night for the missing people, but 
they were hampered by the un
stable remains of the structure, 
as well as fatigue and tempera
tures in the 20s.
Infrared equipment was used 
by search and rescue specialists 
from the Philadelphia and 
Harrisburg fire departments to 
pinpoint where they believed the
victims were, while crews used 
small hand tools to dig through 
the rubble.
Janice Nisbet, spokeswoman 
for the Lehigh County Emer
gency Management Office, had 
said that workers had gone 
through every air pocket look
ing for any survivors.
Thirteen unidentified people, 
including five rescue workers, 
were taken to area hospitals. 
Conklin said most were treated 
and released.
David Lesak, chief of the Lehigh 
County hazardous materials
team, said most of the injuries 
were blast related as opposed to 
chemical related.
By daybreak, Lesaks crew had 
decontaminated about 80 workers 
with a water and soap solution.
There were reports of a chemi
cal cloud that drifted toward 
Allentown, and people within a 
one-mile radius were asked by 
police going door-to-door to stay 
indoors for about two hours Fri
day night.

not immediately be reached 
for comment.Four-Day Forecast

50 YEARS AGO, February 23, 
1949  The Tartan invited can
didates for Student Council to 
submit platform statements to 
the newspaper, but only five chose 
to do so.
Some of the suggestions pro
posed by candidates were to elimi
nate unnecessary discussion on 
the Council floor, increase school 
spirit, and better relations be
tween the Council and the ad
ministration.
25 YEARS AGO, February 19, 
1974  After a three-week delay 
because of a truckers strike, En
tropy opened its doors for the 
first time. The student store 
closed at 10 pm on weekdays and 
Saturdays and 8 pm on Sundays, 
and was located in Skibo Hall. 
Among the services and products 
the old Entropy offered were
check cashing, t-shirts, greeting 
cards, and'paperback books in 
addition to todays fare of contra
ceptives and laundry tickets.
In addition, President Cyert 
awarded the first Carnegie Grant 
to encourage educational inno
vation on this day. The grant 
was awarded to David E. 
Wojick, then an assistant 
professor of history, and a 
joint team from GSIA and the 
English Department. At that 
time Wojick was developing 
a new technique to analyze 
public policy debates called 
issue analysis.
10 YEARS AGO, February 21, 
1989  The construction 
of the new University Center was 
indefinitely delayed due to a lack 
of funds for the building from the 
Capital Campaign.
President Cyert admitted that 
although the campaign itself was 
doing well, most donors requested 
that their money be used for spe
cific projects other than construc
tion, such as new professorships 
and educational grants.
According to Student Govern
ment President Andy Robitshek, 
the University Center was the 
top concern for students.
5 YEARS AGO, February 21, 
1994  SDC voted to spend 
$23,000 to purchase a new 35mm 
projector and sound system for 
Doherty Hall 2210.. The money 
for the new projector came from 
money returned by campus long
distance service AT&T ACUS, 
after overcharging students for 
the 199192 school year.
Although SDC felt that the new 
projector would allow them to
enhance the quality and timeli
ness of the movies they show, AB 
expressed strong objections to the 
purchase. They argued that this 
money could be better used on 
other projects on the campus, such 
as improving Skibo Gym or bet
tering housing conditions.
1 YEAR AGO, February 23, 
1998  Dr. Gloriana St. Clair 
was hired as the Universitys new 
head librarian.
According to Provost Paul 
Christiano, St. Clair was hired 
because of her extensive famil
iarity with university libraries 
and willingness to help raise 
funds for the library.

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon University  22 February 19995
As number of applicants increases, acceptances decline
dr.L11L0i1v tp:/ geIl w
enrollment issue by accepting 
over 10 per cent fewer students 
for the 1997-1998 school year. 
Despite the fact that there have 
been years when the enrollment 
target has been exceeded, result
ing in a space crunch with class
room and faculty resources being 
pushed to their limits, Steidel 
and Elliott both said that 1,280 is 
the correct target class size.
People think that the class
room problem is an OLR 
problem, said Elliott. Thats 
simply not true. We know more 
about class sizes and statistics 
than ever before. He added 
that Enrollment Services 
would rather have one full lec
ture class than two partially 
filled classes.
We are really hurting for class
rooms, said Provost Paul 
Christiano. We have targets 
of admission for each college, and 
I think the enrollment' depart
ment does a good job of meeting 
those targets. Were pretty much 
on target for enrollment. Some 
specific courses and areas are 
feeling pressure as they have be
come popular.
However, the administration 
does not think that reducing the 
1999-2000 class size is a viable 
solution for the classroom short
age. Some of the classes are 
larger than they should be, said 
Elliott. Crowding is not univer
sal . It is specific to certain classes 
and schools. Accordingto Elliott, 
however, reducing the class size 
would cause problems.
Enrollment gets built into the 
budget, and cutting the class size 
by 100 students might do some
thing significant to it, he said.
According to Christiano, stu
dents should be able to finish all 
requirements for their primary 
major within four years. Stu
dents who are overloading and 
attempting two majors are the 
people who may have trouble, 
said Christiano. He explained that 
an increasing number of students 
are attempting to complete two 
majors and overload, which ag
gravates the overcrowding issue.
We will be able to accept a nice 
group of students, said Steidel 
in reference to students already 
admitted for the 1999-2000 year. 
Steidel again attributed the in
creasing standards of admissions 
to the greater popularity of CMU. 
Its a strategy that is paying off 
over time, he said.
The increase in applications 
brings new hurdles for Admissions. 
We have constrained resources 
and space issues, said Steidel in 
reference the Warner Hall admis
sion offices. We have basically 
taken over the first-floor confer
ence rooms for letter processing. 
Space is a huge problem, but its a 
good problem to have rather than 
not having enough applications.
Admissions has also had to re
adjust its schedule to cope 
with CMUs increasing popular
ity. We started earlier and are 
no longer open for individual in
terviews. We moved the applica
tion deadline to January 1 from 
January 15 to allow more time to 
go through the applications, 
said Steidel.
The trend of increasing appli
cation numbers forced many uni
versities to abandon on-campus 
interviewing sessions, but accord
ing to Steidel, the interviewing 
process is still quite important 
to CMUs Admissions Office. We 
used to interview 12 months of 
the year. It is to our advantage to 
provide personal interviews while
many universities move away' 
from them, he said.
According to both Steidel 
and Christiano, Admissions! 
and Enrollment have both! 
recognized the need to more ef-! 
fectively forecast how many stu
dents to admit and how many 
of the students admitted 
will reply.
We are seeing an increase 
in the number of students this 
year, and we are going to be 
more selective, said Steidel. Last 
year the University admitted 
5,598 applicants, and this 
year they plan on admitting 
nearly 200 less. Admissions will 
mail its final decisions in the early 
part of March.

eluded that would infringe on the confi
dentiality of individuals or groups. 
According to Mathew Monroe, a se
nior electrical and computer engineer
ing major, much of the information that 
the Committee used to make its 
conclusions came from Rothschild him
self, mostly in the form of email. Even 
still, Rothschild objected to many of the 
conclusions in the report. Unless he, or a 
Senator, pushes for the committee to be 
re-formed, no action will come of this
report. Rothschild has not indicated any 
plans to pursue the matter, but does not 
feel that the Committee helped to fur
ther define the position of Treasurer, 
which is only two years old.
The Committee did what it needed to 
do for Senate  determine that further 
investigation was not necessary, 
said Rothschild. I was hoping 
that the Committee would have 
accomplished more, and in doing 
so would set up my actions as 
better precedent.
Student Body President Sarah Gross, 
a junior history major, said that the next 
steps taken in the matter of the 
Treasurers conduct will be informal.
I think [Rothschild] will sit down 
with a number of the people involved 
and get feedback, said Gross. The 
committee found that hes not really 
doing anything wrong, but [people] 
are still having trouble working 
with him because of the way he acts.

Corrections/Clarifications...
In last weeks article, Students explore careers at job fair, the organizer of 
the fair, Anna Houck, was misreferred to as Beth Miller.
Also last week, in the article, Film crew returns to campus, Don Hale did 
not in fact say that the interferences caused by filming would be minor. 
Actually Jeff Stimmel, location manager for Wonder Boys, said that they would 
be minor during spring break.
In Student Senate Minutes, the function of the bookstore task force was 
unclear. The bookstore task force will be looking at the current services and 
prices at the bookstore and considering options for improvement. Suggestions 
included ordering books from amazon.com in bulk and using a third-party 
vendor. There was agreement that students should be able to access a list of 
what books they will need before the semester begins.

2/15 STALKING, 5:36 pm  A CMU 
student was worried when she found out 
that a stalker with whom she had previ
ous trouble had flown from California to 
Pittsburgh to see her. She called Cam
pus Police and told the responding of
ficer that in the summer of 1997, she 
placed a no-contact order against the 
stalker. He left Carnegie Mellon in the 
fall of 1997 and moved to California. 
Since then, he continued with several 
forms of harassment, including contact
ing her parents in New York.
The officer told the woman to contact 
Campus Police again if the stalker tried 
to contact her, which he did. She called 
Campus Police and reported his attempt 
at contact. An officer obtained a warrant 
for the stalkers arrest, charging him 
with harassment by communication and 
stalking. The next day the officer called 
the stalkers cellular phone. He told the 
officer that he was at the Pittsburgh 
Airport getting ready to leave on a 5:30 
pm flight to California. The officer told 
him that he needed to talk to him, so the 
stalker agreed to cancel his flight and 
come to the Campus Police station.
When the stalker arrived, the officer 
told him that he was being arrested and 
that criminal charges would be filed 
against him. The stalker told the officer 
that he came to Pittsburgh only to check 
on her well-being and to protect her. 
The stalker was searched, handcuffed, 
and transported to the Allegheny 
County Jail.
2/16 THEFT, 4:28 pm  A CMU 
graduate student was using the Skibo 
Gymnasium to work out. He locked his 
items in a locker but when he returned 
his lock was missing. He opened the 
locker to find that, while his clothes and 
other items were still there, his wallet 
was missing.
He called Campus Police to report the 
theft. He told the responding officer that 
he lost his CMU ID, his Venezuelan ID, 
four credit cards, and $15. The students 
Master combination lock appeared to 
have been cut with bolt cutters.
The student contacted MasterCard to 
cancel his cards. He found out that his 
card had already been used in a $200 
transaction at The Gap and a $70 pur
chase at National Record Mart. The stu
dent canceled that card and his Ameri
can Express card. He told the officer 
that he would cancel the other two when 
he got home.
Three days later, a Central Property 
Services custodian turned in the 
students wallet to a security guard. The 
wallet contained several credit cards, 
but no cash. The guard contacted Cam
pus Police to report the recovery. The 
wallet was returned to the victim.
2/17 ASSAULT,7:19pm Four CMU 
students were sitting at a table in the 
computer science undergraduate lounge 
in Wean Hall. Another student arrived 
and sat down and shook the table as ajoke. 
One of the original four repeated the shake
to jest back at the new arrival. At this 
point, one of the other students stood up 
from the table, glaring at the male who 
repeated the gesture. He told him, Im 
sick of your shit! and punched him in the 
jaw. The victim stoodup to defend himself, 
but another student got between them, 
preventing any further altercation.
The victim went to the Campus Police 
station to report the assault. He told an 
officer that he and his attacker hadnt had 
any previous problems. He said that the 
only reason he wanted to file the report 
was in case there were any future prob
lems. The victim said he did not want any 
intervention by Campus Police or Student 
Life, choosing to use a Computer Science 
Department advisor to deal with the mat
ter informally.

Community Standards in Action
The Carnegie Mellon Code maintains that violations of community standaxis are taken 
seriously. The University Committee on Discipline (UDC) is a hearing board made up 
offaculty, staff and students. The UDC hears cases of alleged serious violations of 
community starulanis and makes a recommendation for action if they find the student(s) 
to be responsible for a charge. Not all judicial cases are referred to a hearing board. In 
fact, during the 97-98 year 179 cases resulted in a mediated agreement between the 
parties involved (these agreements included completion of community senice, planning 
or participating in educational pmgrams, paying fines, placement on probation and 
restitution to the community). Additionally individual alcohol violations, (such as 
untlerage consumption) resulted in 30 students beine issued Pennsylvania State 
Citations. These cases were adjudicated through the city magistrate.
The chart below highlights select UDC cases between the Fall 1997 and Spring 1998 
semesters. In accordance with state and federal law protecting the privacy of student 
records, details of cases are excluded in order to prevent the clear identification of the 
siudent(s) involved. _________________________________

Is it REALLY worth it?
Students at Carnegie Mellon, because they are members of an academic community 
dedicated to the achievement of excellence, are expected to meet the highest standanls 
ofpersonal, ethical, and nwral conduct possible. The commitment of its faculty staff 
and students to these standards contribute to the high respect in which the Carnegie 
Melllon degree is held. Students must not destmy that respect by their failure to meet 
these standards. Students who carmot meet them should voluntarily withdraw from the 
university. Excerpts from the Carnegie Mellon University Code
The Carnegie Mellon Code maintains dial breeches in academic integrity arc taken seriously 
Suspected academic disciplinary violations are handled at the course level by the faculty 
member (this also includes reporting the incident to deans and department heads). An 
Academic Review Board (ARB), (a hearing board made up of faculty and students) is 
convened for severe first offenses, for all second offenses and for student appeals. The 
ARB hears cases of alleged serious violations and makes a recommendation for action if 
they find the student to be responsible for achaige.

FORUM
Carnegie Mellon University22 February 1999
University must limit 
incoming class size
Recently, the Office of Admis
sion announced that the 13,473 
applications received as of last 
Friday eclipsed the previous record 
set in 1996. This is the third year 
in a row that there have been over 
13,000 applicants to a class with a 
target size of less than one-tenth 
of that number  1280. Because 
there is already a shortage of class
room space, housing, and other 
facilities at CMU, the admissions 
staff should keep the number of 
acceptances low to avoid more en
rollments than anticipated.
According to Planning Services 
Carnegie Mellon Facts, there has 
been a 7.8 percent increase in the 
number of units taught between 
1993 and 1997. Over that same 
period, however, the total net as
signable space for classrooms and 
services rose by about one-tenth of 
a percent. While several construc
tion projects have taken place 
across campus, many of the new 
structures do not include class
rooms. The University Center, 
Purnell Center, Roberts Hall, and 
the Building D extension only add 
recreational space, meeting rooms, 
offices, research labs, and studios. 
While these kinds of resources are 
needed, the lack of additional class
room space is simply unaccept
able for a university which has 
seen an increase in enrollment for 
three of the past four years.
Academic departments are 
forced to restrict their offerings 
when they are faced when they are 
faced with a greater number of 
entering students than expected. 
In recent years, the Carnegie In
stitute of Technology has restricted 
the number of students that 
could declare a major in electrical 
and computer engineering, be
cause the demand for that field 
has exceeded the capacity. If steps 
are not taken to control the num
ber of enrolling students more 
closely, situations such as this will 
only get worse.
Another problem arises from the 
Universitys requirement that all 
first-year students live in on-campus housing. Inthepastfewyears, 
there has been a need to assign 
students to temporary housing at 
the Hampton Inn. Last fall, 40 
students lived in such housing. 
Two years before that, there were 
100 residents there. On top of this, 
additional first-years have been 
forced to live in the Oakland Apart
ments spaces leased by the Uni
versity simply because there 
werent spaces anywhere else. 
Placing a first-year student in the 
Hampton Inn or in the Oakland 
Apartments is expensive, and it 
also first-years of the positive so
cial atmosphere that they would 
receive in a dormitory setting.
While the recent news from Ad
missions is optimistic because of 
the potential for greater diversity 
of future CMU students, the num
ber of acceptances must not in-: 
crease. A exceedingly large Class 
of 2003 will do much more harm 
than good, putting additional 
stress on a space crunch that is 
already painful and placing an4 
unnecessary financial burden on 
the University to accommodate the 
new students.

Letters to the Editor
Teamsplm cltesmU 
smAclcet selspg1
. 0E3Editor:
It was with great 
dismay that I opened 
last weeks Tartan to 
discover that the cov
erage of Sex Week enLetter to the Editor
tirely ignored a subset of the presenta
tions  the events sponsored by the 
Carnegie Mellon Interfaith Council.
Students attending the presentation 
In the Beginning ... It Was Good may. 
have been surprised to learn that the 
Bible does not say sx is good. It says sex 
-is very good (Genesis 1:27-28, 31). At 
least six religions agree, as the
presentations by campus ministers from 
the Judaic, Catholic, Orthodox, 
Islamic, Lutheran, and Baptist 
faiths demonstrated.
Most people are probably at least 
marginally familiar with biblical prohi
bitions about sex. David Bayness 
presentation Gods Five Positive 
Purposes for Sex took a different look at 
the Bible. Instead of looking at 
prohibitions, Mr. Baynes looked at rea
sons for which the Bible encourages sex. 
It may come as a surprise to some that 
physical pleasure is among those rea
sons (Genesis 18:12), albeit only 
within marriage.
Controversial author Wendy Shalit 
(A Return to Modesty)s presenta
tion Victorians Secret prompted a 
lively discussion regarding how many
of todays youth are finding that the 
sexual revolution of the sixties was 
a failure. They are discovering that 
a return to the more restrictive 
rules and modest dress of their grand
parents generation is actually 
resulting in more satisfying, more 
erotic, and more pleasurable 
sexual relationships.
Journalistic integrity demands that 
coverage of the week include 
all of the events to some extent. 
Instead, The Tartan chose to pursue an 
anti-religious bias by not covering those 
events sponsored by the Inter
faith Council.

Pittsburgh needs no more stadiums
Departments require 
accurate Web sites
Many academic departments at 
CMU have done a poor job of creat
ing useful and informative Web 
sites to represent themselves. A 
school as technically oriented as 
CMU should have an accurate 
online source of information for 
prospective students, whose first 
impression of the University might 
well be drawn from such a re
source. More importantly, the Web 
is becoming an increasingly popu
lar place for current students to 
look for the most recent news about 
events, information about require
ments and course offerings, and 
departmental contacts.
As with any online resource, up
dating content on a regular basis is 
a fundamental part of making de
partmental sites useful. Many de
partments fail to do this. Currently, 
the Mechanical Engineering 
Departments news link points to 
a newsletter from the summer of 
1997, and theHistoiy Departments 
home page features a link to its 
History Now newsletter from the 
spring of the same year. Other de
partments sites, such as those of 
the Engineering and Public Policy 
and Materials Science and Engi
neering Departments, lack a sec
tion for current news. Publishing 
informationaboutupcomingevents 
and programs on a regular basis 
would encourage students to use 
the available resources more fre
quently and also get more involved 
with their department. In addi
tion, making sure that links to 
course home pages exist and are
up-to-date would make it much 
easier for students to find 
these pages.
Keeping the content of Web sites 
current also has public relations 
benefits for the University. Due to 
the growth of the Web as a com
munications medium in the past 
few years, potential students first 
glimpse of Carnegie Mellon may 
well be what they see of it online. 
It becomes difficult for prospective 
students to make an informed de
cision about which school to at
tend when the information on 
which they base their choice is 
sometimes two years out of date.
Since CMUs online presence is 
highly decentralized, many of the 
sites are not well interconnected 
or similar in design, forcing users 
to learn a new interface each time 
they visit a new area. While the 
technological climate of CMU does 
not lend itself easily to a central
ized Web site, more of an effort 
should be made to promote consis
tency of both design and content 
among the sites.
The Web is not currently being 
used to its maximum potential as 
both an information and public 
relations tool at CMU. It is im
perative that departments take 
the initiative to update their sites 
and make them the valuable re
source that they have the poten
tial to be. Both current students 
and prospective students could 
clearly benefit from having welldesigned, well-maintained depart
mental Web sites at their disposal.

Once again, the city of Pitts
burgh is being asked to fund a 
major urban revitalization 
plan. The one comes in the form 
of a new baseball stadium for 
the Pittsburgh Pirates, as well 
as an expansion of existing con
vention facilities, to finally 
move Pittsburgh into the 1990s. 
The plan itself is highly politi
cally charged, calling for the 
commonwealth of Pennsylva
nia to fund most of the building 
endeavors with the understand
ing that the city of Pittsburgh 
will repay the 300-plus million 
dollars needed for this plan. 
The city of Pittsburgh intends 
to repay the money in part with 
the increased tax revenue that 
the project would bring, and in 
part with the revenues that the 
sports teams themselves are 
expected to generate as pay

H&SS students lack career resources
Editors Notebook
by Lorelei Laird
My major is called professional writ
ing. From its name, youd think that it 
would be an easy field in which to find 
jobs. But my experience at CMU has 
been quite the opposite  for all the 
resources available to me, Ive found few 
employment opportunities through the 
University that do not require a 
technical or business orientation. My 
friends in other humanities majors have 
similar difficulties. While the job mar
ket may not provide as many opportuni
ties for humanities majors as it does for, 
say, computer scientists, I know more 
jobs are out there than Ive seen
through CMU. As things stand, the Uni
versity does not do an adequate job of 
providing career resources for 
humanities students.
The recent College of Humanities and 
Social Sciences job fair was a good ex
ample of this. While a yearly job fair is a

Abortion constitutes 'necessary killing
r_______Yishan Wong
Sometimes I just like to be com
pletely serious. 
Bertrand Russell
Abortion ends a human life. I 
consider a fetus a human being. I 
think when you perform an abor
tion, you really are killing. It 
doesnt matter if its partial-birth 
or just a few cells. That thing 
left in the womb is as much a 
human as someone temporarily 
in a coma, and when you end its 
life, you are killing a person.
Nevertheless, I am pro-choice. 
I have no qualms about killing, 
because I am not a weak-minded 
moral idiot and I can make hard 
decisions that result in the deaths 
of other human beings.
President Clinton made those 
same decisions when he imposed 
sanctions on Iraq. To date, these 
sanctions have resulted in the 
deaths of 1.5 million Iraqi 
civilians. (http://www.ucd.iel 
~islamic) The same sorts of deci
sions brought us into World 
War II and visited massive 
slaughter upon various southeast 
Asian countries.
Oh, is it different? Perhaps means of making more. It is 
were only doing it because largely the Christian-domiSaddam Hussein is 
maintaining a brutal re
gime of oppression and 
terror. Or perhaps 
we only went to war to 
fight the imperialist Axis 
powers, or to contain 
communism, an ideology 
opposed to freedom and 
democracy. Sometimes 
its right to go to war 
because its a good cause.
Or rather, sometimes 
its right to go and kill 
lots of humans when 
someones got their 
rights infringed upon.
Communism doesnt 
mean kill. It just means 
no free market. And it 
spread to other coun
tries, eating up freedom 
and human rights every
where. Obviously, this
not about valuing life. It is about 
ruthlessly slaughtering Muslims to 
gain control of the Holy City. It is 
about burning women who ex
periment with healing herbs 
because the Bible declares that 
one shall not suffer a witch to 
live. And it is largely conser
vative Republican rhetoric that 
glorifies military service in the 
defense of ones country. 
Weve certainly done a good job 
killing aggressors on another 
continent. Is life important?
During the Vietnam War, the 
press did a good job of bringing 
back horrifying pictures of the 
effects of war. You know, bru
tal pictures of maimed and dead 
humans  much like pictures 
of aborted fetuses. Perhaps we 
only really care because we 
need to have the humanity 
brought to us. Much of the anti
war sentiment at the time arose 
because people could see the

the droves. But sometimes hard 
decisions have to be made; people 
have to kill and innocents have to 
die so that others can have this 
precious thing we call freedom.
Human history is not about 
valuing life. Life is not precious. 
Should there ever be a shortage, 
there are proven and popular
nated Republican hypocrisy in Gulf, the government learned from 
this nation that cries for conits old mistake and was very dilitinuing sanctions on Iraq  gent about limiting press coverage.
Beware  the truth about abor
tion may not be the only atrocity 
that needs revealing.
Humans are all about killing. We 
dont value life. We value ideas, 
rights, and material resources. So
sanctions that kill hundreds of 
human beings each day. It is 
the religious right that also 
claims some sort of holocaust is 
going on with the current abor
tion situation. Christianity is
when a womans convenience is 
infringed upon, making her give 
birth to a child she doesnt want, 
that limits her freedom. It doesnt 
matter what kind. We dont re
ally care either. We care arbi
trarily about freedom as it suits 
us: Freedoms like free enter
prise arent anywhere in the 
Constitution. We like to limit free
dom of speech by calling it hate 
speech, somehow legitimizing it 
with worthless rhetoric  after 
all, its hate. Right to life? Wed 
bomb Iraq and extinguish every 
trace of life there if we didnt need 
someone to drill the oil for us to 
feed our petrol-starved economy.
We are not about preserving 
life. If we were, wed have nation
alized health care. And if we ex
amine what we really care about, 
life isnt it. We may care about 
our loved ones, but its not really 
life, but merely what they mean 
to us that we value  life is only 
the operating system upon which 
they function. So stop being so 
afraid to make the difficult deci
sions. Get with the program and 
be pro-choice.
Yishan Wong is seen by many 
people as a sort of ogre. Why, he 
ought to club those people and eat 
their bones.

clear that it was only looking for 
people to program, and maybe 
some technical writers. Andersen, 
on the other hand, sought people 
from any major  as long as they 
were looking for business experi
ence. So information and deci
sion systems, logic and computa
tion, and business-oriented hu
manities students (who had al
ready been to the Technical Op
portunities Conference and Busi
ness Opportunities Conference) 
benefited from the job fair  but 
how about history, German, phi
losophy, political science, or psy
chology majors who want experi
ence in their fields? Surely theres 
no dearth of places for an inter
preter or a Congressional intern. 
By not bringing in employers of
fering experience in the humani
ties, the organizers did H&SS stu
dents a disservice, and negated
H&SS itself offers, such as the 
$2,000 grant available to hu
manities students pursuing un
paid internships, are steps in 
the right direction, it could do 
more to help. The college might 
try posting job opportunities 
on a public bulletin board, mak
ing career-specific advising 
available in each department, 
or setting aside further grants 
for unpaid internships and in
ternship searches. Without 
taking an active role in its 
students job searches, H&SS 
can only reinforce the idea 
that humanities students 
are unemployable.
Carnegie Mellon University 
was once Carnegie Tech, and 
that legacy is with us still in 
our undeniably technical ori
entation. But by including a 
humanities school, the Univer
sity implies an equal commitits vaguely insulting to be offered 
the dregs of the internship market 
the point of having an H&SS job 
fair at all.
Resources are equally scant 
elsewhere on campus. At the Ca
reer Center, half of one shelf of 
books is dedicated to humanities 
students on job searches  far 
less than those available for, 
say, business majors. The hu
manities job listings that the Ca
reer Center collects are usually 
for the subset of career-oriented 
majors within H&SS. And al
though some ofthe programs that
ment to students in non-technical majors. Humanities ma
jors have a lot to offer the work 
force  analytical skills, writ
ing skills, research skills. The 
University needs to take steps 
to make sure that the 
employment world appreciates 
those skills.

could be achieved by this 
new initiative.
However, these proponents fail
to recognize the very dis------
tinct differences between 
Pittsburgh and Cleveland 
that have allowed the lat
ter to make the transition 
from an industrially based 
economy to a mixed one.
Unlike Pittsburgh, Cleve
land was able to utilize 
the building of two new 
stadiums, a new arena, the Rock 
n Roll Museum, and an exten
sion of its already-larger mass 
transit system and airport be
cause of a larger commercial 
base that existed before any of 
these endeavors. Cleveland 
boasts some ofthe countrys larg
est markets for such educated 
professionals as lawyers, with the 
countrys third-largest legal mar
ket, and doctors, with world-renowned hospitals such as Uni
versity Hospitals and the Cleve
land Clinic. No matter how the 
commonwealth decides to waste 
its money in either Philadelphia 
or Pittsburgh, we here in Allegh
eny County will not see the dras
tic and uplifting economic upturn 
that the residents of Clevelands 
Cuyahoga County have seen. In
stead, all we are likely to see, in 
the grand tradition of most Pitts
burgh endeavors, is a poorly 
planned, poorly financed, and 
poorly conducted regional initia
tive. The initiative will build a 
new, unneeded stadium for 
Pittsburgh, while still not focus
ing on the real economic 
hardship that this city will
continue to face in the 
coming decades.
If the proponents of this new 
stadium truly wish to revitalize

population with the same age 
and education levels as other 
cities that have faced this prob"Neither simply building a new stadium

Pittsburghs shrinking economy, 
which is the only urban economy 
to have actually declined over the 
course of the past 20 years, this is 
surely not the way to go about it. 
Pittsburgh does face major eco
nomic and social hardships; it 
must try to force its economy to 
diversify. However, there exists 
no reason it cannot achieve such 
a goal. The story of what Pitts
burgh has been through in the 
past 20 years, and the story of 
what this city is going to have to 
go through, is nothing new in 
American urban history. Rather, 
it is a perfect example of how poor 
civic leadership can leave a city 
in need when the mills have closed 
and industry has moved on.
Even though Pittsburgh is 
starting off this economic race 
many years after other cities rec
ognized the need for economic 
diversification, the goal is not un
attainable. The city of Pittsburgh 
has a tremendous potential, 
which I grant will never be fully 
recognized. Yet there exists no 
real barrier that should prevent 
it from achieving what many 
other cities have been able to.
lem. The city and its residents 
simply need to recognize those 
problems before they can go out 
and ask the commonwealth to 
waste another half-billion dol
lars in the name of professional 
sports. They need first ask the 
commonwealth for money to fix 
this citys aging infrastructure 
and school systems. The case 
here is not If you build it, they 
will come; instead, it is If you 
repair it, they will come back. 
The people, money, and com
mercial and industrial bases 
that left Pittsburgh decades 
ago will return, but only if this 
city can fix its walls and 
foundation and not simply 
add a fresh coat of paint.

and he and Peters came out one-two in the 
200-yard breast, both setting school records.
Our breaststrokers were great, said 
Belowich. They really worked well with 
each other.
Rounding out the Tartans top individual 
performances was the foursome of Robinson, 
first-year Matt Shewchuk, and sophomores 
Rob Gallagher and Jon Alpert, who all placed 
in the top 10 in the 100-yard freestyle.
The atmosphere at the meet represented a 
stark contrast to last years Championships, 
which were held at CMU. The Emory facility 
featured more stands for spectators in the 
actual pool enclosure, resulting in a feverish 
level of cheering. [The spectator stands] turn 
the facilities from a pool to an arena, said 
Belowich. The people in the stands were part 
of the events much more than in our 
pool where they were upstairs, isolated from 
the action.
A lot of us lost our voice in the first day, 
said Gallagher. Not once did the noise in 
there subside. It was exhilarating.
The experience of traveling to the Champi
onships turned out to be a positive effect for 
the team. We stayed in a hotel and swam in 
a different pool than were used to. Changing 
up our routine helped a lot, said Robinson.
It was a lot less distracting than last year 
when we had to stay in the dorms, said Rock
well. The events themselves took longer and 
were more draining, however.
I respect [Belowich] and the athletic direc
tors here much better now, said Robinson. It 
was really well-run last year. This year was 
kind of disorganized at times.
Nevertheless, the Tartans came away from 
the Championships with a number of bench
mark accomplishments and 
can do nothing now but prac
tice and wait to see who will 
get an invitation to the 
NCAA national meet. Un
fortunately, it will be a long 
wait until they find out who 
made nationals. The women 
will know Friday, and the 
men find out the fol
lowing week.
This year a lot of guys 
were concentrating on na
tionals more than previous 
years, said Robinson.
Its a numbers game, 
said Belowich. If you have 
an A cut, you make it. If you 
have a B cut, you wait and 
hope that you qualify. Were

hoping to send a relay team this year. That 
will really help our national ranking. All 
the Tartan hopefuls are on the B list.
The team as a whole this year has evolved 
a lot from where we were last year, said 
Rockwell, who is one of the NCAA national 
qualifiers. Each recruiting class just gets a 
lot stronger. Were starting to establish an 
identity as a team. Im really happy with 
what weve done.

nated as the teams traded turn
overs and missed chances. After 
10 minutes, the margin had 
hardly changed, with Carlows 
lead shrinking to six, 48-42.
Just as it began to look like 
CMU would never get back into 
the game, a slight break in the 
Carlow pressure gave the Tar
tans a chance. Using long passes 
to break the press, the Tartans 
were able to generate two-on-one 
chances and closed the gap. A 
pair of free throws by junior guard 
Sherry Cribbins pulled the Tar
tans to within four with plenty of 
time left on the clock.
Carlow quickly changed that 
situation, slamming the clamps 
back on the CMU offense and 
pushing the lead back up to 11 
before the stunned crowd had fin
ished cheering for the CMU run. 
The Tartans were unable to 
mount another challenge in the 
final five minutes, and four late 
free throws set Carlows final 
margin of victory at 14, 67-53.
After the game, Seidl gave 
Carlow their due credit, but acSTUDY IN
knowledged that the 
Tartans played well 
below their usual stan
dards. It was an aw
ful game, she said. 
They came to play, 
[and] we didnt.
One of the major fac
tors in the game, ac
cording to Seidl, was 
Carlows ability to get 
the Tartans off their 
game. We lost a little 
bit of focus, she said. 
We tried to run, and 
we cant do that. We 
need to play more 
controlled.
The Tartans record 
entering the final week 
of regular-season play 
is 10-13. The team 
hosted the University 
of Rochester on Feb
ruary 21 and will wrap 
up the regular season 
with a chance to se
cure third place for 
themselves when they 
play at Emory on Feb
ruary 27.

The men's basketball team began their effort to climb out of the 
UAA cellar against the Unversity of Rochester last Sunday.
By ALEXYS HANCZAR
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
Again showing that theres no 
such thing as an off-season for a 
dedicated team, the CMU crew 
team was in action again last 
weekend in a pair of indoor row
ing competitions. While the ma
jority of the team crossed the bor
der into Ohio for the Ohio Valley 
Indoor Rowing Championships on 
Saturday, February 20, two mem
bers took a much longer trip to 
Boston for the Crash Bs World 
Indoor Rowing Championships on 
Sunday, February 21.
For all team members, last 
weekend represented the last in
door race of the semester, al
though for some team members, 
it was also the first. I would like 
to say that it was a great first 
race, even though I didnt do as 
well as I would have liked to, 
said novice rower Gabriel Sali
nas. But this far from makes me 
feel disappointed.... [It] gives me 
more reason to train harder to do 
it better next time.
First-year physics major Trista 
Stearns turned in an outstand
ing performance in Marietta, row
ing a personal best and only missing a second-place finish by four 
seconds. Sophomore history ma
jor Meredith Powers, the team 
captain, also had a successful 
performance, cutting her time 
down to record a new personal 
best. Senior business adminis
tration major Martin Richards 
and graduate student Paul Wiley 
found out the hard way that ev
ery second is crucial when their 
outstandingtimes couldnt stand 
up to the test and they had to 
settle for their respective silver 
and bronze medals. Senior busi
ness administration major 
Joanne Wei had less trouble, 
earning the team yet another gold 
in the womens varsity light
weight category.
Meanwhile, over in Boston, 
first-year design major Aria 
Thomases and sophomore busi
ness administration major Dave 
Clumpner represented Carnegie 
Mellon to the international row
ing community at the highly com
petitive world indoor champion
ships. The competition, set up in 
heats according to each 
competitors best 2K time, en
abled Thomases and Clumpner 
to row next to some of the worlds 
best rowers. Each category, comprised of many rowers in the same 
weight class, has numerous heats. 
In the end, each heat is compared 
to the others of that category, and 
the fastest time wins. Both com
petitors from CMU were not only 
striving for their best perfor
mances, but they were also look
ing forward to a new experience 
among very skilled rowers.
For the team, the race experi
ence is not finished when the row
ing is over. One of the greatest 
aspects of crew is that members 
see each other at their worst and 
their best, said Steve Muckle, 
the mens team captain. They 
see each other in the morning in 
old clothes and groggy faces, but 
at the same time, they have 
the opportunity to see each 
other shine.Sports this week....

Both swim teams place third in UAA meet
By BRIAN SMITH
Tartan Special Projects Manager
We made history again, said senior 
Jen Skuly. Im just amazed. The 
Carnegie Mellon swim teams traveled 
to Atlanta last weekend to cap off a 
banner year with the University Ath
letic Association (UAA) Championships.
We went there to get third place. We 
came away with a lot more than just 
third place  we came away with 
great memories, said Skuly. I never 
dreamed that I would swim the way I did 
this week.
The year marked one of the largest 
steps yet in a team that has seen a 
dramatic evolution from a core of less 
than 30 dedicated swimmers just three 
years ago to a nationally-ranked pres
ence in the sport last year. This season 
also served as a sort of changing of the 
guard in the UAA, as the Johns Hopkins 
men were unseated from atop the stand
ings for the first time since the inception 
of the conference by Emory University.
This league is getting faster with each 
season, and there was very good compe
tition this year, said junior Catherine 
Nguyen. Weve been getting faster and 
bigger too, and we made a big impact 
on the meet.
The teams went into the meet with 
specific goals in mind  the women 
wanted to continue leapfrogging up the 
ranks of the conference and finish in 
third place for the first time in team 
history. They also wanted to avenge an
early season loss to Washington Univer
sity of St. Louis. The men were in con
tention for second place  with Johns 
Hopkins (a team they beat for the first 
time in history earlier this year) stand
ing right in their path.
Unquestionably, the team came ready 
to compete. They had quite a meet, 
said head coach David Belowich. The 
Tartans set a total of 16 school records 
and a number of UAA marks on top of 
that. Last year we were establishing a 
precedent, said Belowich. This year 
people were surprised that we were able 
to step it up even more.
In a meet where the top three mens 
teams scored a combined total of over 
2,400 points, Johns Hopkins beat the 
Tartans by 12, giving the men their 
second straight third-place finish.
It makes you think If I had maybe 
done some things different in the past 
few days, maybe made a flip turn a little 
cleaner or something, it would have 
made the difference,  said junior 
Mike Onofray.
In fact, a CMU disqualification in the 
800-yard freestyle relay on Friday 
stripped the Tartans of 30 points, and 
may have made the difference in the 
finish. One of our guys jumped in the 
water before the race was over  the 
Brandeis team was four lengths behind 
everyone else and still going when he 
jumped in to cool down, said Belowich. 
That was a mistake we should not have 
made, but we did and had to move on.
Nevertheless, the Tartans are happy
with the effort. It was really awesome 
that we got the place that we did, said 
sophomore Julie Tseng.
The women accomplished both of their 
goals, beating Wash. U. and taking third 
place for the first time in team his
tory, improving on last years fifthplace finish.
I dont think that we had a bad 
swim from any of the girls, said 
Belowich. [And] every single one of 
the guys contributed points, which is 
just amazing.
A rundown of all of the highlights of a 
meet of this magnitude would undoubt
edly exclude a number of great Tartan 
performances. One Tartan performance 
that was clearly unforgettable, however, 
was that of junior Erin Rockwell.
In the final day of competition on Sat
urday, Rockwell blew away the competi
tion in preliminaries with a school record 
2:26.09 in the 200-yard breaststroke. 
Seeded first in the race, she then pro
ceeded to beat her own record in the 
finals with a 2:25:37, demolishing the 
old record by nearly a second and a half 
and qualifying for consideration for the 
NCAA national meet in March. 
[Rockwell] was amazing, said Belowich. 
She was really by herself in the field for 
the whole race.
On top of that, Rockwell beat the school 
record in the 100-yard breaststroke. In 
addition, sophomore Julie Tseng, Skuly, 
first-year Ian Peters, sophomore Jason 
Striner, junior Mike Robinson, and 
sophomore George Heidinger all placed

CMU women make late run in UAA standings
Crew competes at indoor meets
By MATT BRUN
Tartan Sports Editor
As the sun sets on yet another UAA 
basketball season, the Tartan women 
are wishing it would stretch out just a 
little while longer. While the schedule is 
winding down, the competition is pick
ing up.
Though the conference championship 
has become a two-horse race between 
runaway leaders Washington Univer
sity of St. Louis and New York Univer
sity, the battle for best of the rest is wide 
open, with three teams separated by a 
mere game and a half in the standings.
Going into their game against Chicago 
on February 14, the Tartans were one 
game behind Chicago, who in turn trailed 
Emory University by just half a game. 
Looking to move into a tie for third in the 
conference and get some momentum 
heading into the last week of the season, 
the Tartans were also hoping for a good 
performance to replace the memory of 
their last game, an 84-55 loss to Wash
ington, the undefeated league leaders.
Judging from the previous meeting 
between CMU and Chicago, the game 
looked to be a close, physical contest.
The Tartans won the previous game by 
a mere four points in Skibo Gym, and 
were anything but overconfident head
ing into the rematch in Chicago.
As expected, the dominant aspect of 
the game was physical play. The Tar
tans lack of size and strength has been 
a weakness all year, and the Maroons 
were clearly looking to capitalize on it. 
As in the first game, the score remained 
close throughout the contest, with nei
ther team able to gain a significant edge.
We were in control for most of the 
game, said head coach Gerri Seidl. The 
problem was our physical toughness.
The turning point came late in the 
game with CMU clinging to a slim lead. 
Chicago was forced to foul to prevent 
CMU from running out the clock and the 
Tartans clutch free-throw shooting 
sealed the victory, 55-51.
Once the referees started calling fouls 
and we got to the free-throw line, things 
went much better, Seidl said.
The win moved the Tartans into a tie 
for third in the conference with Emory, 
who lost a pair of games to slip back. 
Junior center Kara Coval paced the Tar
tans, leading the team in scoring, with 
12 points, and rebounding, with 18.
Sophomore guard Lauren Petruzzi protects the ball from 
a Carlow defender while driving to the basket.
Having made their 
statement in the UAA 
standings, the Tartans 
returned to Skibo Gym 
for a non-conference 
game against Carlow 
College. Early on, CMU 
appeared to be in com
plete control, quickly 
jumping out to a 10-2 
lead with an eight-point 
run keyed by junior cen
ter Samantha Majemik 
and sophomore guard 
Lauren Petruzzi. For a 
few brief minutes, the 
Tartans dominated the 
game, grabbing every re
bound and easily beat
ing Carlows full-court 
press.
Unfortunately, CMUs 
impressive play did not 
continue for long. Carlow 
answered the Tartans 
run with one of their own, 
a 13-1 spurt that culmi
nated with a wide-open 
three-pointer that gave 
Carlow the lead, 15-13.
The two-point margin was the_ closest 
the Tartans would get for the rest of the 
game.
In a matter of minutes, Carlow took 
charge of the action and CMU found, 
themselves getting outworked all over 
the floor. The press began to take its toll 
on the Tartans, who were repeatedly 
frustrated when trying to inbound the 
ball, and were forced to expend extra 
time and effort just to move do wn court. 
When they were able to get into the 
offensive end, the Tartans were unable 
to set up their offense and often settled 
for tough outside shots in tight coverage.
For the remainder :>f the first half, 
Majernik and Petruzz.. shouldered the 
burden of keeping the Tartans in the 
game, scoring the majority of the few 
points Carlow allowed, .^side from a few 
individuals, the Tartans were sluggish, 
being outhustled for almost every loose 
ball and rebound. Carlow took fiill ad
vantage of this, and slowly extended 
their lead throughout the half, but the 
Tartans didnt let them out of reach, 
never falling behind by more than eight. 
At halftime, Carlow led 37-29.
For much of the second half, play stagCalenl nll ,dEEv geIl B

WD1TCR SPENDS NIGHT WTIH POUCE
By ASEEM GUPTA
Tartan Webmaster
It was a Friday night, just like any other night at CMU, and I was 
doing the North patrol with Officer Ronald Pudlowski. I was pre
pared for a night of high-speed chases, robberies, and doughnut 
shops just like those in my favorite TV drama, NYPD Blue. Even 
though we didnt catch any evil thugs or speed down Forbes Avenue 
at 140 miles per hour, I gained a respect and admiration for a group 
of cops who are infinitely superior to those New York wannabes.
At 10:45 pm, we approached Marybelle Apartments. Pudlowski 
explained that there was a back door to the building that was not

He acts as the supervisor during this night shift.
accessible from the road and we would have to stop to make sure it 
was locked. He switched off the patrol car and we went out on foot. 
The door was locked, and Pudlowski pointed out some of the less 
obvious trouble spots. Sometimes we get homeless people back 
here who want to sleep or go through the trash, he said.
Pudlowski explained that the campus police 
have jurisdiction over all CMU property and the 
area 500 yards around such areas. We dont 
patrol some areas of the CMU neighborhood 
because some areas are private, he said. In these 
areas, the city of Pittsburgh has jurisdiction.
At around 11:00 we drove through the fraterni
ties. According to Pudlowski, this area is of partic
ular concern because of the party atmosphere.
Between 11:00 and 11:30 we visited many of the 
sites that were on the North patrol, including a 
quick stop at President Cohons house close to 
Schenley Park.
Officer Pudlowski returned to the police station 
in the old Student Center at 11:30 after a very 
quiet first hour of patroL Officer Jim Simonetti 
replaced Pudlowski in Car Four shortly after 
11:30. Before we left the station, Simonetti did a 
comprehensive check of the vehicle. Before 
the beginning of each patrol, we check the car to 
make sure that everything is in working order, he 
said as he briefly switched on his siren and 
police lights.
Simonetti has been a police officer with Campus 
Police since October 1998. He said that although 
he enjoys his job, he feels that students do not give 
the CMU police the respect they deserve.
They view us as a big joke, he said as we entered the parking 
lot between Building D and Doherty Hall. Students dont know 
what theyre getting involved in, and they dont realize the actual 
trouble they can get in when they dont cooperate. They can end 
up down at the Allegheny County jail, and that can be a very 
rude awakening.
Shortly before midnight Simonetti was called back to the station 
to fill out a harassment report for three students who just walked 
in. One female student and a male student filed a complaint 
against a fellow student whom they alleged was making phone 
calls of a harassing nature.
Simonetti spent nearly 45 minutes speaking with the students 
and taking down their report. While he completed his reports, I 
spent a few minutes talking to Sergeant Robert Payne. Our police 
department can provide services to the community that the Pitts
burgh police would never be able to, he said. He cited the harass
ment crime that Simonetti was documenting as an example. He
Brian Smith/Tartan Special Projects Manager 
Jim Heverly coordinates all ongoing activity from his dispatcher position.
explained that CMU police could provide support and advice to 
students in a unique way because they are so closely associated 
with the CMU community.
At 1:00 Simonetti and I were back in Car Four patrolling the 
campus. At 1:05 we drove through the fraternity quad, which 
Simonetti said was very quiet for a Friday night. The first incident 
of the night was at 1:11. As we drove past the A-Plus Mini Mart, a 
cab driver flagged us down. He said that there was a drunk man 
in the back of his cab who was not acting appropriately. Well just 
sit here and wait for the city police to show up, said Simonetti. A 
few moments later, a city paddy wagon drove into the gas station 
with its lights flashing, and Simonetti and I left to continue the 
North patrol.
Between 3:00 and 3:30 things usually start to calm down. If 
something hasnt happened by 12:30, it usually means it is going 
to be a quiet night, said Simonetti as we drove down along Fifth 
Avenue towards Mudge House. We passed Mudge at 1:38

SQUAD SAVES UVES
By GREG NOFI
Tartan Features Editor
With its many hospitals and treatment cen
ters, Pittsburgh has some of the best health 
care facilities in the country. But how does this 
help you when you have just badly cut yourself 
with an X-Acto knife? Or what if a stranger 
walking by you suddenly goes into cardiac 
arrest? In cases where immediate medical care 
needs to .be given around campus, the CMU 
Emergency Medical Service (EMS) team is 
there to help the victim before its too late.
The CMU EMS team is certified by the State 
of Pennsylvania at the Basic Life Support level. 
It is an all-volunteer organization, made up of 
undergraduate students, graduate students, 
and staff members. Faculty members can join 
as well, but there are currently none on 
the team. Because it consists of members of 
the relatively small CMU campus, EMS is 
highly responsive.
Were able to get to any place on campus in a 
very short matter of time and provide emer
gency medical care in minutes, said Charles 
Anthe, senior electrical and computer engineer
ing (ECE) major and EMS executive director. 
This is not to say that the Pittsburgh EMS ser
vice is bad. We do a lot of minor medical emer
gencies like sprained ankles and deep cuts.
The problems that EMS is capable of treating 
are not restricted to basic ones, however. Last 
summer, the group added two automatic exter
nal defibrillator (AED) devices, thus giving 
them the power to save a person whose heart 
suddenly stops working.
Basically, when someone is having a heart 
attack and going into cardiac arrest, theres a

mal state, said Anthe.
The EMS was able to obtain this equipment 
due to recent technology that has made the 
AED easier to use.
Before, the ability to do this was reserved for 
doctors and paramedics because you had to be 
able to determine if a shock needs to be admin

STUDENTS CONSIDER <MJ SAFETY ISSUES
By REENA SINGHAL
Tartan Staffwriter
In the three years that Ive been here, I have 
never felt unsafe walking on our campus, said 
Jacey Stroback, a junior communications design 
major. Strobacks opinion was shared by several 
students, who agree that overall the CMU campus 
and the surrounding area is safe, although there 
could be some improvements to make it safer.
Resident assistants (RAs), like Marita TovarGamero, an RA in Fairfax Apartments and a 
sophomore policy and management and Spanish 
double major, help make students aware of any 
problems that occur on campus or in the sur
rounding area. [We] put on safety programs for 
our residents, [presented by] Campus Police and 
Pittsburgh Police, she said.
According to Tovar-Gamero, the police bring 
information such as ratios of Campus Police to 
students and types of crime that occur in the 
area. They also discuss what to do in various sit
uations, such as with a suspicious car slowing 
down while a student is walking home. Flyers 
from Campus Police are posted around campus, 
including all the dorms, reporting incidents on 
and off campus that students should be aware of. 
However, such measures only work if people 
report incidents to the police, according to Ed 
Knittel, a senior design major.
Some students, like Lisa Glass, a junior 
mechanical engineering major, became more cau
tious after reading such flyers. The only time I 
felt unsafe walking alone on campus was when I 
was made aware of the rapes that had occurred off
campus, said Glass. [After that] someone would 
always walk me home, she said.
Laurel Hoffman, an undeclared first-year stu
dent in the Carnegie Institute of Technology, said 
she often walks between the main campus and her 
room in Mudge at night. In the middle of the 
night, there is not a lot of light on campus. In some 
places [on campus] its really dark, like in the 
Morewood parking lot where not all the lights 
always work, she said.
Chirag Shah, a junior electrical and computer 
engineering major, agreed that lighting on cam
pus could be improved for increased safety. Most 
people work pretty late, and usually have to walk 
back from the academic buildings to their rooms 
with just the light from building entrances to 
guide them, said Shah. Installing more lights 
along the walkways from the academic buildings 
would solve this.
Problems of security and safety do not only exist 
outside, as student precautions must also be 
taken inside the dormitories. Desk attendants are 
required to file incident reports in the case of any
one suspicious walking into the buildings, or any 
problems that occur. In both dormitories and aca
demic buildings, personal security of belongings is 
also an issue. I think the only unsafe thing about 
campus is all of the thefts. Its ridiculous how 
much people steal here, said Knittel.
Overall, though, there was a positive opinion of 
personal safety at CMU.
As compared to most urban college campuses I 
have been on, I think our campus is fairly shel
tered from many of the more serious crimes that 
college campuses usually face, said Shah.

A single terrorist attack 
killed 86 people in Buenos 
Aires in 1994. To date, no one 
has been found responsible by 
the Argentinian judicial sys
tem, and not a single suspect 
has been found or arrested. 
The relatives and friends of 
those killed are still demand
ing justice. A three-year 
anniversary march was held in 
1997, and has been document
ed by industrial design student 
Ignacio Filippini in a photo
graphic and mixed-media exhi
bition entitled justicia.y. memoria, which opened last Thurs
day in the University Center 
Art Gallery,
I am extremely impressed. I 
usually dont get emotionally 
affected by art exhibitions, but 
this one affected me, said 
Tbby Zelkowicz, a sophomore 
design major. It is clear, 
direct, powerful, and beautiful
ly done.
The bombing attack was on 
the Israeli-Argentine Mutual 
Association (AMIA) which 
housed the Jewish community 
center. One of Filippinis goals 
in his exhibition was to bring 
information to the local com
munity. I wanted to let the 
Pittsburgh community, includ
ing students, be aware of 
whats going on, said Filippini. 
I wanted to let people know 
that theres a Jewish communi
ty in Argentina, that its big. I 
wanted to raise awareness. 
Filippini advertised his exhi
bition locally, including poster
ing in Squirrel Hill. Those at 
the opening included members 
of both the local Hispanic and 
Jewish communities, as well as 
students. Most U.S. Jews are 
underaware of Jewish commu
nities around the world, said 
Dan Wiseman, director of the 
Hillel Jewish University Cen
ter at CMU. We have a ten
dency to be ethnocentric, and 
forget about the tremendous 
diaspora Jewish experiences.
In one photograph, there was 
a banner that read justicia 
justicia. This quote from the 
Bible justicia justicia reminds 
us that Jewish thought on jus
tice and righteousness is 
strong. Repeated words in the 
Torah all have a special mean
ing, said Filipinni. The repe
tition indicates that justice is 
not enough. We have to pursue 
it in a legitimate way.
I wanted to convey informa
tion and have an emotive 
response, said Filipinni of his 
exhibition. I wanted to convey 
the feeling of the march, and 
the feeling of human connec
tion, tp give a window into 
what is happening.
Rachel Whipple, a sopho
more psychology and Spanish 
double major, brought peti
tions to the opening on behalf 
of Amnesty International. A 
lot of what Amnesty Interna
tional does is to try to bring 
justice, and ensure that people 
around the world have their 
human rights guaranteed,

ronment design to involve the audience in the anniversary march.
said Whipple. We brought 
petitions. The Argentinian gov
ernment has been suppressing 
journalists lately, threatening 
to stop them from publishing 
information about these kinds 
of events. As citizens we have 
the means to change things 
through petitions and letters, 
This exhibition explains 
that terrorism is not good," said 
Tevfik Gemci, a post-doctoral
student in mechanical engi
neering. We are facing the 
same problems in Turkey. In 
the international arena some 
countries support terrorism. 
People must be told that terror
ism is not good. You can solve 
the problems in another way.

We all know that CMU churns out 
students whose real-world skills keep 
pace with those of any other students in 
the nation. But its always nice when 
something happens that really brings 
that point home.
Earlier this month, a team of CMU 
students won first place at the engi
neering design competion held at the 
annual Society of Hispanic and Profes
sional Engineers (SHPE) National 
Technical Career Conference in Los 
Angeles, California. The team, consist
ing of sophomore chemical engineering 
major Nadia Amador, sophomore 
mechanical engineering major Alek
sandr Bernhard, junior business 
administration and economics double 
major Michelle Frank, junior ECE 
major Luis Munoz, and senior design 
major Julia Rodriguez, designed and 
built a prototype for a pool safety device 
called PoolGUARD. The Tartan caught 
up with Bernhard to discuss Pool
GUARD, the competition itself, and the 
joys of Krazy Glue.
The Tartan: Can you relate to us a 
little about your groups entry for the 
design competition?
Aleksandr Bernhard: Its called Pool
GUARD; its a plastic grid that lies in 
the bottom of the pool. If someone falls 
into the pool, theres a shock sensor on 
the water surface, and it knows and 
automatically raises the grid at the 
bottom of the pool and lifts the person 
out of the water.
A lot of people were asking, How 
can you tell the difference between 
between if its raining and if someones 
falling in? But you can buy pool shock 
sensors that can tell the difference.
TT: Did your group have any partic
ularly memorable experiences while at 
the conference?
AB: We got there late and went to an 
opening party and when we got back, 
we realized that part of the prototype 
was broken off. [A couple of our group 
members] had to walk out and buy 
Krazy Glue at Kinkos in the middle of 
L.A.  pretty much in the ghetto  in 
the middle of the night. I was too lazy 
to go, so they went, and I had to glue it. 
Krazy Glue can do a lot of stuff.
TT: What kinds of things does the 
CMU chapter of SHPE do besides go to 
the conference?
AB: We have a lot of activities 
throughout the year. Theres a bunch 
of events we go to out of the city. 
Theres ETCC, which is the Eastern 
Technical Career Conference. There 
are also a couple of other leadership 
conferences. We have a resume book, 
where we get resumes from the 
National Society of Black Engineers, 
the Society of Women Engineers, and 
the Institute of Electrical and Elec
tronic Engineers.
We have a bunch of community ser
vice activities that we go out and do 
too. One of the things we had this year 
was walking dogs.
TT: What kinds of things did you 
gain from your experience?
AB: Going to these conferences is 
simply an excellent way to make 
connections with various companies. 
I had a lot of guys talking to me about 
internships for this summer. This is 
a great experience. Im probably learn
ing more being on a design team than 
I have in classes. You have to take 
so many things into account, not 
only engineering aspects but business 
aspects or other things that you 
wouldnt expect.
Erica Yamada/Tartan Darkroom Manager 
Bernhard participated in the National Technical Career Conference, where he was on 
the winning team as a member of the Society of Hispanic and Professional Engineers.
TT: So what went on at the competi
tion itself? What was it like?
AB: We had to present [our idea] 
during a presentation where we all 
talked about different parts of the 
design and demonstrate a prototype 
we had made. We got lucky because we 
had people in all different kinds of 
majors, not just engineering. We had 
business, we had a design major, and 
we had ECE. We had the whole range 
to work with, so our presentation came 
out really good.
There was a panel there of nine 
judges from a bunch of different com
panies like NASA and some computer 
corporations, and we had to present 
our design to them. It was pretty pro
fessional because these guys are from 
top-notch companies.
TT: How did the group come up with 
the idea for PoolGUARD?
AB: Last year, we did a safety mech
anism for a car, so we decided to stay 
on the safety mechanism idea. At first, 
it was just going to be a pool sensor, an 
alarm that went off in the pool, but we 
decided to expand it to something that 
actually saves the person, gets them 
out of the pool, and stops people from 
jumping into the pool unattended. 
When youre not around, you can raise 
the grid so its at the pool surface level 
above the water, so people cant even 
get in the pool.
TT: What did you think about your 
chances for winning?
AB: I didnt even think wed get to 
the finals. Its a pretty outlandish idea, 
but obviously they thought it was good. 
The funny thing is, a bunch of the 
judges were telling me, You all should 
go out and get a patent for it, and 
stuff like that.

CMU ushers in Lunar New Year with fashion
By LIN TAO
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
Last Friday, the Asian Student Assciation, Hong Kong Student Association, 
Singapore Students Association, and 
Taiwanese Student Association all 
united to stage a presentation of exotic 
fashion in celebration of the Lunar 
New Year  hence, the 1999 Lunar 
Gala fashion show. About 40 models  
all of whom were CMU students  
strutted, strolled, floated, and charged 
down the catwalk. Some looking 
suicidally detached, others bubbling 
with boisterous vigor, the models show
cased not only the top fashion of the 
times, but also fantastic costumes 
ranging from imperial gowns to electri
cal breastplates.
For weeks, the Lunar Gala has been 
advertised on campus with glossy twofoot long posters, promising a night of 
glamorous eye candy  which prompt
ed many to come and find out if it would
deliver. The fashion show presented 
attire in six sections  Hirose & Suh, 
Felinczak, Moy & Thorpe, Imagine, Vic
torias Secret, and Moda. Each section 
contains clothing from its respective 
local store or from an original design.
We spent months in preparation for 
this show. The model pick started in 
October. Some 260 models tried out: 
Only 30 were picked for the show, said 
backstage director Pang Loh, a mas
tersstudent in chemical engineering. 
This is my third year coordinating the 
show. In planning for this show, we 
tried to envision the models in differ
ent scenarios - having them slip into 
different roles.
The models, more than anyone else, 
seemed happy to be part of the show.
Its pretty cool because it feels like 
youre a celebrity for a day  or 
at least you pretend youre one, 
said Eugene Kim, a senior public policy 
and management major who modeled 
wearing the golden emperor gown
and also appeared later during the 
Moda presentation.
Me and some friends decided to try 
out because were sick of the good old 
routine  studying, sleeping, movies. 
Its been really fun, said Shing Tai 
Leung, a first-year undeclared student 
in the Carnegie Institute of Technology 
who modeled bare-chested for Moy & 
Thorpe, Moda, and Victorias Secret. 
When youre walking down the stage, 
you have to think that youre the best 
thing there is.
This year was interesting. The male 
models were actually more shy than the 
female ones, especially at the begin
ning, said Loh. In the past year, the 
male models would approach the female 
and the female would walk away. This 
year was it was opposite.
The most unique aspect of the show 
was that about a third of the program 
showcased student designers. It opened 
with the line of Haruna Hirose, a junior 
design major, and Sunny Suh, a mas
ters student in drama. It 
consisted of several col
orful and shiny slip 
dresses. Oblivious to 
the sub-freezing Pitts
burgh climate, the mod
els paced slowly down 
the walk holding paper 
fans and moving as the 
night  dignified and 
beautifully cold.
Hirose and Suhs dis
play was followed by 
that of Carrie Felinczak, 
a sophomore Humani
ties and Arts major, 
whose design identity 
could be summed up in 
three words: slits, shim
mers, and slip-aways. 
The next student 
designing duo featured 
clothing created by 
Spencer Moy, a junior 
design major, and Neil 
Thorpe, a junior unde
clared student in 
Humanities and Social 
Sciences. We were

The festivities at the 1999 Lunar Gala not only featured models and fashion to celebrate the new 
vear of the Rabbit, but also included various entertainment acts such as these dancers.

inspired by the urban industrial cul
ture. We wanted our stuff to be aggres
sive  hence the whip. We just wanted 
to whip it up, said Moy when asked 
about a whip-holding lady in black.
But the show was not just entertain
ment for the single male population: It 
also featured the Yohji Yamamoto 
dancers. We practiced the first dance 
for over a month, and the second one we 
put together in a week. The guys and I 
worked very hard and we just wanted 
to have fun, said Samuel Byun, a 
sophomore chemical engineering major 
and lead dancer.
The traditional Chinese ribbon 
dancers, consisting of Shin-Yi Tseng 
and Stephanie Yang, senior business 
administration majors, and Ruth Lee, a 
first-year undeclared student in 
Humanities and Social Sciences, also 
performed. Clad in traditional Chinese 
costume, the ribbon dancers waved 
their colorful cloud of ribbons over the 
stage, bidding the audience good, for
tune, longevity, and happiness.
The sold-out show was received with 
applause and cheer. The Lunar Year of 
the Tiger thus ended and the year of the 
Rabbit began.

Series of programs addresses womens issues
By ELAINE BOLAND
' Tartan Assistant Diversions Editor
The often-talked-about male-tofemale ratio on the Carnegie Mellon 
campus was radically thwarted last 
Sunday during the annual Mosaic Conference on Womens Issues. This halfday conference dealt with many of the 
concerns women face on a daily basis, 
and provided a means by which women
could gain valuable information about 
gender relations.
Some of the topics discussed in the 
Mosaic workshops included health and 
wellness, violence against women, 
career issues, and academics. The 
workshops were open to the entire 
campus community, and while a few 
males could be spotted at the various 
sessions, the attendance was predomi
nately female.

Recent alumnae share their perspectives on preparing for career success after graduation.
Hillary Carey, a junior design major, 
attended the Beyond One a Day Plus 
Iron session, which tackled health 
questions about vitamin and iron sup
plements, osteoporosis, and breast and 
skin cancer.
I found it to be very informative 
about what women need as far as vita
mins and medical care are concerned, 
and they even talked about breast can
cer, Carey said.
According to the orga
nizers, much time and 
effort went into planning 
the conference and mak
ing sure that the topics 
presented were the ones 
which would be most 
helpful to those in atten
dance. To accomplish this, 
surveys were set up in the 
University Center lobby 
to get input about what 
sorts of topics would be of 
interest. Then, the orga
nizers looked to programs 
which had been popular 
in the past, and relied 
upon community input to 
come up with the pro
gram for this year.

major and Community Chair of the involved in womens issues.

There are several different 
levels of certification, all of 
.which are represented on the

the most training with 120

rently, there are 16 CMU 
EMTs. This spring, for the first

credit EMT class that meets for 
four hours, three evenings a

Despite the major time commit

wheeling a stretcher down the 
hallway and doing all sorts of 
interesting things, said Anthe.
Besides EMTs, there are also 
10 first responders, who have 
received 40 hours of training. 
Finally, there are members at 
the standard first aid level.
First responders have the 
same level of training as 
you would find in city firefight
ers. Those who administer 
First Aid have only received 
the basic introduction, said 
Tim Corcoran, a doctoral stu
dent in biomedical engineering 
and EMT. You have to be 
working for quite a while 
before youre allowed to go to 
a scene by yourself to adminis
ter treatment.
EMS is in service 24 hours a 
day, seven days a week while 
school is in session. During hol
idays and breaks, if there is 
personnel available, there will 
also be EMTs on call. Winter 
break is the only time of year 
when the group is closed.
In case of an emergency, 
calls for medical help should 
be made to Campus Police 
at x8-2323. EMS members 
then receive notification of the 
incident on their radios 
through the police dispatcher.
When calling, state your 
location, be descriptive, and 
dont hang up on the dispatch
er. Let the dispatcher hang up 
on you, said Anthe.
Last year, EMS received over 
600 calls. These requests 
for help were answered as 
swiftly as possible, an effort 
that helped victims at CMU in 
situations where time is criti
cal. There are many universi
ties, however, that do not have 
this service.
CMU students are very 
fortunate that the University 
has greatly supported EMS 
as an organization over the 
years, said Anthe. In that 
way, CMU is actually sort of 
ahead of the curve over 
similar universities.

and headed back towards the 
fraternity quad.
At 1:45 the dispatcher called 
Cars One and Four and 
informed them that an emer
gency alarm had been activated 
in a parking lot. Simonetti had 
said to me earlier that when the 
dispatcher calls two cars at one 
time, it usually means that 
there is potential for some sort 
of major activity. Just as Simon
etti was accelerating and 
getting ready to turn on his 
lights, the dispatcher canceled 
the call, explaining that it was a 
false alarm.
One of the most frequent 
types of calls that the CMU 
police get involves students who 
are locked out of their rooms. At 
1:52 Simonetti received a call to 
unlock a door for a student at 
the Doherty Apartments.
After Simonetti unlocked the 
door for the student, he and I 
drove through the fraternity 
quad again and Simonetti 
decided to stop and watch the 
traffic for violations of the traf
fic law. This lull gave me an 
opportunity to ask Simonetti 
about why he became a police 
officer. Simonetti cited his 
uncle, who was a police chief, as 
one of his primary sources of 
inspiration. The excitement of 
helping people and doing one of 
societys most important jobs 
has also beenvery important 
for him.

He also talked about one of 
his favorite shows, CHIPs, and 
the appeal of the lifestyle 
depicted in the hit TV show. It 
is not as glamorous, but I enjoy 
what I do, he said. Just as he 
finished his sentence, he spot
ted a car running a red light.
At 2:16 he stopped the blue 
Volkswagen Fox and cited the 
driver for running the red light 
at Morewood and Forbes 
Avenues. Simonetti called in the 
license plate number for a stan
dard check, and it came back as 
being negative for violations. 
The driver, who happened to be 
a CMU student, was issued 
a warning.
Shortly before Simonetti 
stopped the VW Fox, he 
received a call from the station 
and the dispatcher told him he 
had an 88 back at the station. 
Its lunch, Simonetti said. We 
returned to the station at 2:30 
for a brief break and then we 
were back i Car Four.
As we drove up Forbes Avenue 
from Oakland at 2:59, Simonet
ti spotted a cream-colored Mer
cury Sable driving without its 
headlights on. Driving without 
headlights can be an indication 
of a DUI [driving under the 
influence], he said. People 
often forget the little things 
when theyre drunk because 
theyre too busy concentrating 
on staying between the lines.
Simonetti switched on his 
police lights and called for back
up. While Simonetti was citing 
the driver, the passenger 
attempted to get out of the car 
because she had spilled honeymustard sauce all over her
clothing. Because of police regu
lations, she was not allowed to 
stand outside of the car during 
the police stop. Simonetti fin
ished his citation and we were 
again on our way.
Dispatch called Cars One and 
Four at 3:26 alerting them to an 
alarm that was activated in 
Margaret Morrison 103. Simon
etti responded along with 
another police unit and found 
that the alarm was false. Nine
ty-nine point nine percent of the 
time its nothing, but you cant 
assume that and you have to 
react like its the real thing, he 
said. By 3:36 the officers had 
reset the alarm.
The Margaret Morrison alarm 
was not our only equipment 
alarm of the night. At 4:01 dis
patch called two cars to respond 
to an alarm in a Hamerschlag 
Hall computer cluster. Like the 
Margaret Morrison alarm, it 
proved to be false. At 4:15 
Simonetti dropped me off back 
at the station and left to contin
ue his patrol that would end at 
7:00 that morning.
I admit that I was hoping for 
a little more fast-paced police 
action on a Friday evening, but 
by the end of the night I real
ized that it was the lack of 
activity that made the. CMU 
police so special. CMU is locat
ed just a few blocks from the 
center of Oakland, one of Pitts
burghs most dangerous neigh
borhoods, yet CMU is one of 
Pittsburghs safest areas, and I 
now recognize that the safe and 
open community that we enjoy 
and often take for granted is 
made possible by the dedication

Concert brings guest 
vocalists to campus
By CLINTON FIELD
Tartan Staffwriter
Some days, you wake up with a certain 
feeling in your stomach  craving for 
the human voice, straight up, without 
accompaniment. On those days, you can 
be thankful to the CMU SoundBytes for 
providing you with your recommended 
daily allowance of a cappella.
bers a chance to show their solo vocal 
talent, despite occasional interruptions 
such as Order number 470, grilled 
ham and cheese, order number 470. 
The main event came on Saturday, 
however, where the SoundBytes 
teamed up with the University of 
Marylands all-male group, the Gener
ics, and a professional group from Bos
ton, six guys who call themselves Ball
Anthony DAuria/Tartan Photo Staff 
The SoundBytes invited guests from the University of Maryland and Boston to a 
recent concert, where they performed their trademark theme song.
Last week was a busy one for the 
SoundBytes. They started with one of 
their regular concerts at Skibo Coffee
house on Wednesday, where they had 
the opportunity to introduce new songs 
and sing older tunes in a setting less 
formal than a concert hall. This perfor
mance gave several of the groups memin the House. The performance ran into 
a few difficulties beforehand, when the 
Alumni Concert Hall in the College of 
Fine Arts was closed due to the filming 
of Wonder Boys, but McConomy Audi
torium offered a comfortable, if acous
tically less ideal, alternative.

Inconsistency helps quirky film
By DEREK DREYER
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
Generally, a reviewer will use the key
word offbeat to describe a film that is 
too strange and uneven to be recom
mended, but which displays enough tal
ent that the filmmakers deserve to be 
noticed. Quirky serves a similar pur
pose. In any case, Rushmore, the second 
film from director Wes Anderson, can 
only be described as quirky and off
beat, regardless of how those words are 
construed. I doubt, however, that too 
many viewers will find Rushmore any
thing but disarmingly fun.
i
What; Rushmore 
Director: Wes Anderson 
Company: Touchstone
It stars newcomer Jason Schwartzman 
as a 15-year-old boy named Max Fischer, 
who Im sure would hate to be called a 
boy. Unfortunately for Max, he is a boy, 
and in all the wrong ways. For one, he is 
totally immature and has no sense of 
self-restraint. Despite his nerdy appear
ance, he isnt obsessed with any one 
thing, but rather everything. That in
cludes beekeeping, fencing, flying kites, 
and debating in Russian.
Early in the film, Max befriends a 
cynical metal tycoon named Herman 
Blume (Bill Murray) who, while one of 
Rushmores greatest benefactors, in
structs the students to get the rich 
kids in the crosshairs and take them 
down. Hermans married life is a comic 
sham and his two indistinguishable 
sons complete buffoons. In one of the 
films hilarious cinematic references, 
Herman takes on the role of Dustin 
Hoffman in The Graduate, jumping 
into his private pool and hiding be
neath the surface of the water. Both 
Max and Herman quickly see the bond 
connecting them: their common need 
to escape their dull lives by whatever 
means necessary.
 Touchstone 1999
Olivia Williams stars as Miss Cross, and Jason Schwartzman stars as Max Fischer.
Max also meets and falls head over 
heels for Miss Cross (Olivia Williams), a 
new teacher at Rushmore who is effort
lessly lovely. He immediately becomes 
her sycophant, even forming a success
ful petition to reinstate the Latin re
quirement after having tried for years to 
get it removed, just because she men
tions it in passing. It is typical both of 
the films droll tone and Maxs endear
ing arrogance that when Miss Cross 
rebuffs his swift advances on the basis 
that their age difference is too'great, 
Max responds drily, So youre not at
tracted to me. Cestla i>ie.The narrative 
drive of the film comes from the fact that 
Herman is in love with Miss Cross as 
well. This naturally puts a damper on 
his relationship with Max, which turns 
increasingly sour.
One notable feature ofRushmore is its 
inconsistency of ton6. Sometimes the 
array of quirky characters  includ
ing Maxs father Bert, played touchingly 
by Seymour Cassel, and a plucky female 
version of Max played by Sara Tanaka
 threaten to steal the show. But fre
quently the film taps into its more seri
ous side. Consider, for instance, a won
derful scene where Miss Cross confronts. 
Max with the question of what sex would 
really serve in their relationship, and he 
has nothing to say.
Rushmore is also inconsistent in its 
style, which veers from reality-based 
comedy to total fantasy and back with 
the greatest of ease, especially in the 
final scene. Anderson uses it to comic 
advantage. But it also means that Maxs 
world becomes more imaginary  his 
problems become harder to translate to 
reality. By the end, it is unclear whether 
Anderson has made a successful com
mentary on adolescence, or just a goofy, 
original film.
Maybe its neither. In a moment of 
psychic pain, Max angrily tells Herman, 
I saved Latin. What did you ever do? 
However amusing the line may be, Max 
is dead serious, and we can feel his 
frustration. As a vision of life from one 
oddly watchable characters point of view, 
for whatever thats worth, Rushmore is 
a masterpiece.
Afflicted film needs subtlety
By DEREK DREYER
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
It sort of goes without saying 
that if your father is, in es
sence, the devil, then youre 
going to have some problems 
that need to be worked through. 
Wade Whitehouse, the protago
nist of Paul Schraders film Af
fliction, doesnt want to work 
through his problems. And 
guess what: He doesnt live 
happily ever after.
What: Affliction 
Director: Paul Schrader 
Company: Kingsbridge
Whitehouse is portrayed by 
Nick Nolte, in a complex per
formance that has earned him 
several critics awards and a 
best actor Oscar nomination. 
He does a good job playing a 
decent person whose abusive, 
alcoholic father, Glen (James 
Coburn), has more or less 
wrecked his life. Although 
Glen no longer has physical 
control over his son, he reap
pears in Wades daily life af
ter Wades mother dies. Its 
unclear, though, how differ
ent this role is from, say, his 
character in The Prince of 
Tides, another film about the 
effects of chi Id abuse. Whereas 
that film played like one of 
the better Sunday night TV 
melodramas, Affliction ap
proaches its material in a less 
traditional way, with inter
esting but mixed results.
The rather minimal plot is 
set in gear when bigwig union 
man Evan Twombley from outof-town (the town here being 
snowy Lawford, New Hamp
shire) is killed in a hunting 
accident. Wade, who acts as 
part-time policeman and cross
ing guard in Lawford, suspects 
that Jack Hewitt (Jim True), 
Twombleys young hunting 
guide, is up to something. Jack 
evasively lies to Wade about
certain minutiae of 
the accident, and 
that makes us 
doubt him, too.
These suspicions 
are confirmed by 
Wades brother 
Rolfe (Willem
Dafoe), who encour
ages him to pursue 
a conspiracy theory 
based on the fact 
that Twombley was 
set to testify about 
union corruption 
in Massachusetts.
It appears
Twombleys son-inlaw and Wades 
boss might be in
volved as well.
For a while, the 
mystery involving 
Twombleys death 
sustains marginal 
interest, but it even
tually becomes 
clear this is not the crux of the 
film. In fact, Wades investiga
tion is, more than anything else, 
an outlet for the anxiety and sup
pressed fear surrounding his fa
ther. There are other outlets as 
well. Wade is twice divorced from 
the same woman and, unsatis
fied with the custody arrange
ment for their daughter, seeks to 
reopen old wounds and get re
venge. He also pressures his livein girlfriend (Sissy Spacek) to 
think about marriage. And then 
there is that gnawing toothache 
he keeps complaining about.
As Wade begins to drink 
heavily, his expected downward 
spiral ensues. The most effective 
and universal aspect of this bleak 
tale concerns the way the other 
characters (besides his evil fa
ther) contribute to Wades demise 
by backing off from his problems 
and running for cover. The most 
powerful scenes involve Wade and 
his daughter. She constantly asks 
to go home to her mother and is 
not amused by Wades attempts 
to entertain her, although she

Nolte stars as Wade Whitehouse in Affliction.
professes to love him as well. 
By rejecting Wade rather sen
sibly, if coldly, she breaks one 
of his only connections to the 
world outside Glens clutches.
Unfortunately, Affliction is 
so focused on Wades relation
ship with Glen, with its fairly 
predictable resolution, that 
the other characters and 
storylines suffer for lack of 
development. We never really 
get to know Willem Dafoes 
character, for instance. His 
voice-overs telling us that any
one afflicted by Glens evil 
can never really recover are 
redundant, as are the flash
backs to Wades childhood.
Perhaps it is Schraders intent 
to present the world solely from 
an afflicted mans perspective 
and to show how foresight and 
rational thought can be blinded 
by emotions stirred up from the 
past. If so, the film could have 
packed a greater punch had its 
protagonist been more ambigu
ous and his problems been ex
plored more subtly.
French farce entertains writer
By ANDY FRANCIS
Tartan Staffwriter
Having not seen, any previous 
productions by the CMU Drama 
Department, I was a little curi
ous about what to expect during 
Saturday nights performance of 
Georges Feydeaus A Flea in Her 
Ear. Then when I learned that it 
was a French farce, I wondered 
how on earth the cast would make 
such anachronistic material com
pelling for a modern audience. 
But, with rapid-fire dialogue, 
strategic overacting, and door 
slammings aplenty, the crowdpleasing production turned out 
to be quite a comic treat.
Trying to give a brief synopsis 
of the plot is quite a challenge  
it would take me the entire news
paper to describe every plot twist 
and turn and what character did 
what. I had trouble understand
ing myself who was who from 
time to time. The play centers on 
the Chandebise family, Victor 
and Raymonde (Armando 
Rodriguez and Sian Heder), their 
friends Lucienne and Don Carlos 
Histangua (Beth Whitney and 
Jared Gradinger), their doctor 
Finache (Chad Jayson), and 
Camille (Joshua Pohja), a char
acter defined almost entirely by 
his speech impediment. Act One 
takes place at the Chandebise 
house as we learn early on that 
Raymonde suspects Victor of 
cheating, a mistaken idea 
brought about by Victors impo
tence. Raymonde decides to test 
him by writing an anonymous 
invitation to a house of ill re
pute, written in her friend 
Luciennes handwriting. All hell 
soon breaks loose, as Victor elects 
to send his friend Tournel (Rob 
Thain) instead, and Don Carlos 
reads the invitation, which is of 
course in his wifes handwriting.
This simple misunderstanding 
leads everyone to converge on the 
Hotel. Lanterne Rouge in Act 
Two, where the plot gets even 
more tangled. Victors resem
blance to the hotels porter (also 
played by Rodriguez), a revolving
door between two rooms, and 
people constantly going in and 
out of the sets eight doors cause 
all sorts of misunderstanding. 
Other characters, like the hotel 
owner Pinouf (David Folsom) add 
to the disorder already mounting 
on stage. At one point the action 
essentially overwhelmed the 
crowdI think most people gave

up for a moment trying to under
stand and just laughed at the 
absurdity taking place on stage. 
Eventually, the scene returns to 
the Chandebise residence for Act 
Three, everyone gets even more 
puzzled, and at last everything 
gets sorted out.
A number of other factors 
helped the play succeed. The set 
itself, which remained essen
tially the same for the two loca
tions, helped draw the audience 
into the idea of a French com
edy. Antique furniture and back
drops reminiscent of the Indus
trial Revolution dated the play, 
while the plethora of doors on 
stage ensured fast action 
throughout. The costuming was 
appropriate as well  the guys 
wore suits from the time period 
and gaudy mustaches, and the
certain the tone of the play re
mained ridiculous.
From the outset, it became ap
parent that Feydeaus script it
self would be one of the stars of 
the show. The plot of the play wag 
so interconnected it would make 
Seinfeld jealous  nearly every7 
thing anyone did affected at least 
one other character in an unex
pected manner. The play clev
erly reached its zenith near 
the conclusion of the second 
act and kept the characters in 
the dark until the very end.
Most of the attempts at oneliners and puns fell a bit short, 
but the real comic gold lay iri 
the constant confusion and 
misunderstanding that 
plagued the characters 
throughout the play. Perhaps 
the main flaw of the play was 
Feydeaus penchant for stick
ing a character in a certain 
role and not allowing them to 
expand past a defining trait. 
Pohja, as Camille, did an ex
cellent job with his unable-topronounce-consonants charac
ter, but I wish he had been 
given another dimension. Similar 
attempts to flesh out characters 
were also ineffective; Heders 
Raymonde never gets a chance to 
establish herself, and Gradingers 
Histangua was restrained by 
Spanish stereotypes.
Nevertheless, the purpose of the 
play was to entertain, and it cer
tainly succeededthe entire cast 
seemed to have little trouble with 
the material, which required some 
demanding wordplay as well as 
tricky timing with the almost con
stant exits and entrances called 
for in the script. In addition, any 
play of this variety requires a good 
deal of energy, and the actors never 
seemed to tire during their overthe-top performances. Although 
the play left a little to be desired 
as far as comedic lines go, the cast 
and crew were successful at staggirls wore elaborate dresses. The ing the play. Everyone seemed to 
players themselves added to the be in the right place at the right 
image; most spoke with vaguely time or, as Feydeau probably 
French accents, and all spoke in wanted it, the wrong place at the' 
a fairly jaunty manner to make wrong time.

Touch of Evil
Touch of Evil, a 1958 movie written, directed, and 
performed by Orson Wells, has quite a story of 
intrigue behind it. It was Wellss final American 
film, due to the fact that the production staff got a 
little scissor-happy and cut out pretty much every
thing that Wells thought was worthwhile. But in 
1998, the film was reworked based on a 50-page 
manuscript by Wells that was recently found, ex
plaining his ultimate hope for the movie. Twenty 
minutes longer, and completely redone, this tale of 
suspense and intrigue is now true to the form that 
Wells originally envisioned. Whats it about? Well, 
starring Orson Wells and Charlton Heston, its 
probably worth seeing to find out.

Mission: Control!, the debut 
album by Washington, D.C.s 
Burning Airlines, is both wel
come and distressing. On one 
hand, the music is quite deriva
tive, giving us a perfect example 
of the classic D.C. sound. On 
the other hand, they manage to 
use the sound as a base from 
which they expand.
The group comes in part from 
the ashes of Jawbox, a legend in 
the indie rock scene. Along with 
bands such as Fugazi, they epito
mized what became known as 
the D.C. sound: fast, circular 
drum patterns and guitar riffs, 
complex meters, and the use of 
octave runs.
This album continues in such a 
direction. Most of the tracks here 
are similar to those one can find 
on a Jawbox album. Fortunately, 
this album is saved by applying 
quirks to the songs. Wheaton
Calling sounds vaguely similar 
to an 80s pop song without losing 
any of its bite. Surprisingly, 
Flood of Foreign Capital uses 
the fast drums to create a jungle 
sound, on which sits a fair amount 
of hardcore. Even Pacific 231 
merges the standard Jawbox 
sound with post-punk motifs.
Burning Airlines delivers the 
goods on this album. Despite the 
lack of innovation, the group 
shows promise that their next 
album will be groundbreaking.

Photography exhibits human forms
By ELAINE BOLAND
Tartan Assistant Diversions Editor
Walking into the Frame during Friday 
nights photography exhibit, it becomes quite 
apparent that photographers possess about 
20 eyes rather than the stan
dard two. This is the only 
way to explain how the pho
tographs on display man
aged to capture in everyday 
forms elements that gener
ally go unnoticed by the ca
sual observer. Such magni
fied vision was apparent in 
various subjects, ranging 
from a series of barns to the 
naked body.
Four photographs by 
Carissa Vivirito stood out 
particularly at first. Focus
ing on the forms of the hu
man body, Hand on Back,
Becca, Naked Forms, and 
Nude Chest utilized stark 
lighting contrasts to reveal 
beautifully textured con
tours. The Hand on Back 
was especially noteworthy in its composi
tion, and its ability to transform human skin 
into virtual porcelain.
Nearly hidden in the front corner of the 
gallery were pieces by Jacey Stroback. Two 
of the pieces, with the captions Careful not 
to drown and The only way to find peace was 
to close her eyes, created defined moods by 
superimposing one image on top of another. 
In Careful not to drown, a set table with
smooth, shining wine glasses and a glass 
jug are visible over another shot of a swim
mer exiting the ocean. The light playing 
upon the water complements the sheen of 
the wine glasses and produces a distinct 
feeling of calm.
dPkY:P& DAurla/Tartan Photo Staff 
Students admire photographers work in last Fridays exhibit at the Frame.
The same mood emanates from the second 
work, in which a woman with closed eyes is 
superimposed upon a placid lake surrounded Whether it was the series of emotions capby evergreens. The transparent nature of tured in Spiridakis work or the smooth huwas a series of photographs by Elizabeth. 
Spiridakis, set in its own room in the back of 
the gallery. The photos were set in groups 
according to their subjects, which were appar
ently friends and relatives of the photogra
pher. Spiridakis managed to capture a wide 
spectrum of emotion in the faces 
and figures displayed in the room. 
The one which stood out the most, 
titled Tina (I love my sister), was 
a strong piece which conveyed 
much of the love mentioned inlts 
title. Spiridakis caught definite 
energy in the photo of Tina smil
ing, and much of that energy ex
tended into the accompanying 
pieces in that group.

that stood out among the others. 
The piece consisted of glossy coior 
photos of blue sky with stream
ers of airplane exhaust striped in 
various directions. The contrast
ing movement of the strips 
catches the eye, and is the focal 
point of the piece.
The exhibit displayed a wide 
variety of work, yet the most popular subject 
matter was definitely the human body.

Musicals dance sequences win critic
By KATIE KOWALL
Tartan Staffwriter
As part of the Mastercard 
Broadway Pittsburgh Series, the 
musical Chicago, directed by 
Walter Bobbie, is being produced 
at the Benedum Theater. It was 
an entertaining, if sometimes 
unenergetic, performance.
The show, with book and lyrics 
by Fred Ebb and Bob Fosse, and 
music by John Kander, was an 
impressive presentation of a mu
sical that 20 years ago, theater 
critics deemed a failure.
Opening on Broadway in 1975, 
the same year as the blockbuster 
A Chorus Line, Chicago was some
thing of a forgotten entity in the 
theater world. It was bowled over 
by A Chorus Line in the Tony 
Awards, as it was considered less 
smart and sassy than A Chorus 
Line. But in recent years Chicago 
has made a resurgence, due to its 
unique premise and involved 
dance routines.
The show follows the life of 
Roxie Hart (Belle Calaway), a 
woman who longs to find a place 
for herself in the world of 1920s 
Chicago vaudeville. When she 
kills Fred Casely, her secret lover, 
shes thrown in jail. But Roxie is 
wily, and gets into cahoots with
Billy Flynn (Adrian Zmed), a 
stereotypically greasy lawyer who 
specializes in exploiting the me
dia and women, and sucking his 
clients pocketbooks dry.
Along the way, she meets Velma 
(Deidre Goodwin), another 
woman in the prison who has 
committed an equally heinous 
crime against her husband, and 
Matron Mama Morton (Carol 
Woods), who does a favor for you 
if you do a favor for her. In the 
end, Roxie gets out of jail with the 
help of a few of Billys lies, and 
realizes that if shes going to be
come famous, shes going to have 
to do it without the exploitation 
of her situation. Her husband
Babra/Tartan Art Staff 
leaves her, and Velma and Roxie 
take their show on the road.
A few numbers really came 
through with flying colors. Cell 
Block Tango, a piece that in
cludes some hilarious mono
logues and seductive dancing by 
the women in the prison, was a 
winner for sure. Also enjoyable 
was Me and My Baby, which 
featured Roxie singing about the 
future that she dreams of in 
vaudeville. Although the char
acter development was 
downplayed in favor of impres
sive dance moves, there were 
times when the acting shone 
through. Roxie was tenacious, 
and appropriately brazen, and
Amos was quiet, and appropri
ately pathetic. Billy and Velma 
left something to be desired,.as 
both could have delved deeper 
into their characters and gotten 
some more attention.
The minimalist set accentu
ated the beauty of the dancing. 
The set was essentially an or
chestra with some steps and oc
casional props brought out for 
specific scenes. The costuming 
was all in shades of black and 
gray, highlighting the graceful 
physiques of the performers. The 
orchestra was outstanding, and 
integrating it into the set really 
showcased the theatrical finesse 
of the show.
Since this is a touring produc
tion, I can understand the ac
tors exhaustion and boredom in 
performing the same show re
peatedly, and therefore, I can 
excuse their evident lack of en
ergy. That said, Chicago was an 
impressive, if sometimes slug* 
gish performance. Filled wiin 
stunning dance routines awd 
entertaining music, it was fun 
and lighthearted. All in all, Chi
cago was an impressive rebirth 
of an older musical that witiga 
little more enthusiasm could vn 
the respect of theater-going idiences everywhere.
Groups harmonize old and new favorite
1LiALiAv tp:/ geIl Eb
The Generics started the show with a good 
mix of songs and an excellent stage presence. 
Like a number of a cappella groups, the 
Generics set off their singing with a variety of 
on-stage antics. These ranged from their en
trance as a group of statues, with only one 
apparently confused member able to move, to 
an exchange where physical education is 
shown to be a student being hit over the head 
after incorrectly answering math problems. 
The singing itself shouldnt be overlooked, 
however. The vocal percussion and bass pro
vided a solid base for the harmony. The leads 
were generally good, but were sometimes 
overpowered by the background.
Next came the SoundBytes, with songs
from a range of artists from Tom Jones to 
Dave Matthews. Although most of the pro
gram had previously been performed at 
Skibo, the SoundBytes had some new 
tunes, along with old favorites, such as 
their trademark rendition of the theme 
song from the the Saturday morning car
toon show The Gummi Bears. The soloists 
had an especially good night, with a con
sistently high level of performance 
throughout the group.
Ball in the House came as the last group 
of the evening, as well as the loudest. 
Although they only had about half the 
number of people as the other groups, 
their powerful voices and amplifiers gave 
them a noticeable increase in volume.
This might have been grating in a group 
with less harmonic talent, but Ball in the 
House maintained a clear, professional in
tonation to accompany its throbbingly t^jigible bass and driving vocal percussi($i. 
The group sang the requisite hits from tjfie 
80s, but focused most of their performarfce 
on their own songs, which consisted maiiily 
of fairly standard pop with the occasioiial 
injection of hip-hop.
Overall, the SoundBytes had another suc
cess, both in their own performance and the 
performances from their guests. They con
tinue to bring both local and not-so-local tal
ent here to our doorstep at CMU. For three 
dollars a show, you cant ask for much more 
than that.
