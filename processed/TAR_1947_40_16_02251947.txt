Trustees Approve Increase In Tuitin
CIT Public Relations Director Engineering Rates Raised 22%;

Financial Status of The Carnegie Institute of Technology 
As Analyzed by Stanley March, Director of Public Relations.
1. The annual operating budget for 1946-47 is $2,447,000. The 
highest pre-war budget was $1,873,000.
2. In comparing this increase of over $500,000 with $240,000y 
the income from $8,000,000 (amount of Carnegie Corpora
tion gift of July 1, 1946) at 3%the best return obtainable 
on newly invested funds todaypne has a picture of our 
problem.
3. Extraordinary outlays are being made possible by a sub
stantial increase in endowment and now by increased tuition.
4. The average rate of endowment return has decreased from 
4.1% in 1940-41 to 3.80% in 1945, and new funds are usually 
invested at less than 3%.
5. The tuition fee is roughly only half the cost of educating 
a student today.
6. The institution is conducting a continuing campaign for 
additional funds.
7. This campaign is being conducted for improving and build
ing on the campus and increasing th endowment.
8. The differential between income and expenses will con
stitute a serious threat to the 
institution within the next 
few years unless additional 
funds are made available 
from new endowment and

Lectures Planned 
By Tau Beta Pi
Starting this spring, and there
after every fall, Tau Beta Pi will 
sponsor a series of informal talks 
on the general theme: Know
Your Department. The talks, aim
ed particularly at freshmen and 
sophomores, will be delivered by 
department heads or their repre
sentatives at 4:30 in room 104.
First to speak will be Dr. Fred
erick T. Mavis, head of the civil 
engineering department, who will 
initiate the series of Wednesday, 
nesday, February 26. On Thurs
day, February 27, Mr. Wesley 
Cooley of the management depart
ment will speak. Succeeding talks 
will be held Wednesday and 
Thursday of each week.
The series seeks to guide fresh
men and sophomores through the 
confusion of their first two years. 
Almost every student wonders 
why he must take certain sub
jects, what plan underlies his cur
riculum, what he faces when he 
seeks employment after gradua
tion. The speakers will try to an
swer these questions for their re
spective departments.
Girls Take Boys 
To Womans Guild 
Semi-Formal
The traditional Womens Guild 
semi-formal, to be held in the' 
mens gym Saturday, March 1 
from 9:00 to 1:00, will possess all 
the attributes of a south sea is
land wonderland. Tommy Carlyna, 
local boys will provide the musite 
to the tune of $2.40 a couple. Since 
it is a girl-ask-boy propositwm 
flowers are permitted.
The dance is being held to raise 
money for a scholarship fund 
which the Womens Guild offers 
each year to needy student^ who 
are already attending C.I.T*.
Womens Guild is an or ganiza
tion composed of girls appointed 
by sororities, student council, 
publications, and various other ac
tivities on campus. Ada Bucy, 
president of Womens Guild, is 
acting as general chairman. Com
mittee heads include Clara Her
ron and Anna Groomes for dec
orations, Barbara Irwin and Mary 
Roney for publicity, and Joy 
Clark for refreshments. Doris 
Moore is in charge of tickets.

The Executive Board of the 
Carnegie Institute of Technology 
released for publication today the 
official announcement that the tui
tion in the College of Engineering 
and Science would be raised ap
proximately 2Q%, effective with 
the fall semester of 1947-48. This 
jump in tuition will be accom
panied by a 5% increase in 
charges at Margaret Morrison Car
negie College, but includes no 
change in the rates of the College 
iTlf Fine Arts.
The change follows a recom
mendation of the committee on 
F ees and Charges, which was subm itted to the Executive Board 
Fe ternary 4, approved by that body 
las t Thursday, and presented to 
anol approved by the trustees 
yesterday.
T he increase was the result of 
cart iful consideration by the pow
ersthat-ibe in which they examin
ed all possible angles. They de
sire that the facts be presented 
in ithe same manner as they re
ceived them so that the students, 
the faculty, and the public may 
see the basis of their decision.
In an accompanying article 
Stanley R. March, director of 
Public Relations, has presented 
Carnegie Institute of Technologys 
answer to a questionnaire spon
sored by the American College 
Public Relations Association to de
termine the financial status of the 
nations colleges. The facts and 
figures presented there sum up 
adequately the reasons for the 
administrative decision.
Basically the tuition boost is 
naecessary to cover a 40% increase 
fin the total yearly expenses of 
ttfae institution since 1941. This 
. kterease is the result of a dec tease in the return on endown tent since the $8,000,000 receiv

The above chart shows the effect that the increased tuition rates 
will have upon the veterans now in school. Figure months of entitle
ment as of October 1947, and find where a line drawn from that figure 
intersects the diagonal giving expenses per year. At the bottom of 
the graph will be found the number of semesters left under the 
provisions of the GI Bill. _ t
VA Demonstrates 
Effect of Change 
On Entitlements
The Veterans Administration 
has estimated that between 50% 
and 60% of the veterans at Car
negie will not be affected by the 
increase in tuition. These are the 
veterans who through their time 
in the service have more than 
enough entitlement under Pub
lic Law 346, the GI Bill, to see 
them through graduation.
These men may charge any ex
pense in excess of $500 per aca
demic year against their future 
entitlement at the rate of $2.10 
per day. Expenses are defined as 
tuition plus books, supplies, fees, 
and equipment. What this 
amounts to is an exchange of time 
in the future for money to cover 
present expenses. For each $2.10 
a veteran charges in excess of 
his $500 per academic year he 
loses a days subsistence in the 
future.
The above chart may be used 
by the veteran to interpret what 
the rise in tuition means to him. 
The chart shows the number of 
semesters a veteran with a given 
entitlement can remain in school 
at four different levels of expens
es.
For example, a veteran with 
thirty-two months entitlement 
can get eight semesters if he does 
not charge any expenses in ex
cess of $500 to the V.A. If he 
charges $100 per academic year 
in excess of the $500, he can get 
only seven semesters.
Dr. Doherty has announced that 
veterans who show promise of 
graduation, but whose entitlement 
may become exhausted before 
graduation and who must have 
financial aid, will be assisted in
sofar as possible within the re
sources of Carnegie Institute of 
Technologls scholarship and loan 
funds.
the total increases in Techs an
nual operating budget.
The rise in tuition affects both 
the day and night school students. 
The present and revised tuitions to 
be effective in the fall are also 
:shown in an accompanying article.
It is estimated by the veterans 
administration that between 50% 
and 60% of the veterans in school 
will not be affected by the in< crease as they may draw upon 
their entitlement in excess of that 
needed to complete their college 
 careers.

Everything is set for Full 
Speed Ahead, and Rock n Riot! 
is well on its way towards, suc
cess. Tryouts for the dancing 
chorus, singing, and dramatic 
parts in the show have been held 
on the last two Saturdays, and 
the turnout has been excellent 
... as far as the girls are con
cerned. Whats the matter with 
the men on this campusare they 
sheep in wolves clothing? If they 
only knew what they are missing.
Well, if you dont want girls 
dressed as men (other shows have 
it the other way around, but then, 
CIT is always different) heres 
one last chance. The final danc
ing tryout, for men only, will be 
held in Thistle hall on Saturday 
from 11:30 until 1:00. The regular 
rehearsal will begin at 1:00.
Any male, tall or short, fair 
or dark, handsome or  but 
there are no others at Car
negie  has that last chance 
to dance in Scotch and Sodas 
Rock n Riot! Absolutely no ex
perience is necessary; anyone with 
a bit of rhythm, a sense of hu
mor, and an appreciation of femi
nine beauty can dance.

been elected as director, Kenny

Rumors Were Flying; 
So Commuters Slept
The local practical jokers did 
it again last Thursday night when 
they took advantage of the gullib
ility of the press to give equally 
gullible Tech commuters a days 
vacation in a winter fantasy of 
snow a foot deep. Some would-be 
executive contacted the local 
morning paper and informed 
them that the administration had 
decided to cancel all classes be
cause of unfavorable climatic con
ditions.
The effect was electric. Stations 
KQV, WJAS, and WWSW broad
cast the news gathered from the 
front page of the morning paper. 
The news was flashed to the dis
trict and hundreds of students, 
unable to believe their eyes and 
ears, began to call MA. 2600. The 
thirty-six outside lines of the Skibo switchboard were in constant 
use from 7 a. m. to 12:30 p. m. 
as the exasperated operator re
peated the refrain: Rain or
snow, to school you go.
Dr. Dohertys phone was 
eventually taken off the hooks; 
Dean Warden went around with 
cotton in his ears; station KDKA 
turned into an information booth, 
for students were unable to reach 
the crowded Skibo switchboard.
Other students were less eag
er and accepted the news with a 
grin as they rolled over, kissed 
their pillows, and slept till noon.
February 19, 1947.
The meeting was called to or
der at 4:30 p. m.
Those present were: Misses
Cook, Dowd, Hallas, Knott, Lisle, 
Knee, Petrikin, and Price; Messrs.

Dorm Girl Replies
Your editorial in last weeks 
Tartan about Dorm Council has 
brought to light a serious defect 
in the dormitory system. It is true 
that dorm girls are kept under 
lock and key and the will of 
the housemother. Woe to the girl 
who happens to catch the wrath 
of her housemother. Warnings 
begin to accumulate for every 
small misdemeanor, talking on 
the phone for more than five min
utesI think the housemother 
sits with a stop watch and times 
each telephone conversationfor
getting to hang up clothes, or for
getting to clean a room one 
morning. A housemother should 
be a chaperon or a friend rather 
than a disciplinarian.
Motion carried.
Mr. Lee repeated his motion. 
Motion defeated.
Mr. Lee and his committee were 
instructed by Mr. Garner to work 
out other possible dates when the 
elections might be held. 
Publications Committee:
Mr. Cantini moved that the 
following appointments on the 
Tartan be approved:

Mr. Lee moved that we approve 
Mr. Garners appointments.
Motion carried.
NEW BUSINESS:
Mr. Garner appointed Mr. 
Yorkin, as head of the SpeciaJ. 
Committee, to take care of the 
Blue Cross Insurance Group.
Mr. Garner reported that Mr. 
Elliott has sugested that the stu
dents and the alumni co-operate 
to hold a dance in the gym at the 
next Home-Coming celebration. 
There are many problems to be 
settled, but the Alumjni Associa
tion would like to know the opin
ion of the Student Council con
cerning this type of dance.
Mr. Garner read a letter from 
Mr. James B. F. Boyce requesting 
Student Council to underwrite the 
bonds of Scotch and Soda. Mr. 
Yorkin moved that we accept the 
plan from Scotch and Soda; the 
Budget Committee is to make out 
the working part of the plan. 
Motion carried.
The meeting adjourned at 5:30 
p. m.
Respectfully submitted,
Jean Marie Price,
' Secretary.
I agree that if a girl is respon
sible enough to go away to col
lege she certainly should be given 
the responsibility of taking care 
of herself. The present system 
where warnings are doled out 
for every little petty thing is 
rather childish. If the honor sys
tem, a method where every girl 
is pledged to be on her good con
duct, were installed, a far more 
effective method of discipline 
would be in effect. The argument 
that this system wouldnt work is 
invalid because it has been proven 
to work at Wilson College, at 
Simmons College, and at numer
ous other colleges. Why doesnt 
our dorm council try to have this 
system or one similar to it in
stalled?A dorm student

Editors Armchair
Whatsamatter?
What is the matter with the Tartan? We have been told 
by a number of the students that the Tartan is uninteresting, 
and that very few students read it. Why?
We, and every member of the staff, have been doing our 
best to make the Tartan a good newspaperinteresting and 
informative. Wherein have we failed? It is in that the staff is 
neither omnipresent nor omniscient. Our club editor wrote 23 
letters to the heads of various campus organizations, asking that 
they tell us when their organization has some news for the 
paper. She has received one letter in reply to datein a period 
of five months. From that one might thing that nothing is hap
pening on the Tech campus. You know that is not so, because 
you have seen the news about the various organizations which 
has appeared from time to time in the Tartan.
That we have failed in a few instances to get every bit of 
campus news is due principally to the limited staff. Why dont 
some of you who have writing ability and an interest in campus 
affairs come out for the staff of the Tartan? We assure you 
that you wont just sit around with nothing to do. We need 
good workers.
Dont Let Studies Interefere With Your Education
What can you* get for working on the Tartan? In the 
first place, you will gain valuable experience in learning how 
to approach people in important positions, how to find out 
what is going on. Secondly, you learn how to get along with 
people, how to give orders and how to carry them out. For 
the rest of your life you will be working with people, but there 
is little taught in the classroom about this vital knack. Com
ing out for extra-curricular activities such as the Tartan will 
help you to gain this knack.
Certainly engaging in activities takes time. So what! Any
thing of use takes time to acquire. But it is very definitely worth 
the time you spend.
For those students who find it necessary to work in order 
to hold up the financial end of going to college the school has 
scholarships and grants in aid. Scholarships are given to those 
students outstanding in scholastic work who need financial as
sistance to get through college. Grants in aid are given to those 
students outstanding in activities who need financial assistance 
to go through college. Grants in aid for publications work are 
available to those who need them in amounts up to the salary 
formerly paid the office help.
News Versus Features
Now as far as some specific complaints regarding the Tar
tan are concernedwe intend to print Skibo Scraps and 
Fraternity Row in alternate weeks. We feel that there is not 
enough space available to print them both every week, but we 
realize that both are very interesting to the students and we in
tend to devote as much space as is possible to all matters of par
ticular student interest. However, we do feel that the news is 
of more importance than some of the features that we have 
been printing. What we intend to do is to devote a specified 
percentage of our available space each week to features and 
other subjects of general interest which are not news.
The foregoing is the Tartans editorial policy, as for
mulated by the Editorial Board. If you dont agree with some 
of our decisions, please write a Letter to the Editor, stating 
what it is you disagree with, why you disagree, and what your 
name is. If you wish your name withheld, we will do so, but 
the editor must know the writers name if a letter is to be 
printed.
The Editorial We
As far as the editorial column is concerned, we say what 
we think. What we say is true as far as the facts go, but you 
may disagree with the conclusions we draw from the facts. 
Were not at all sorry about what we wrote last week concerning 
the dormitory regulations. After a number of conferences with 
various personages at school and on the campus we are con
vinced that the principal trouble with the present regulations 
is the House Mothers unwillingness to be reasonable about 
interpreting the rules, but we would still much rather see a 
more liberal set of regulations instituted, one which could pro
vide the same sort of regulation for the girls as they might 
receive at home. t

TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 25, 1947THE CARNEGIE TARTAN3
Directors Show Progress 
In Cyclotron Research
Research is proceding rapidly 
on the preliminary work of C.I.T.s 
future synchro-cyclotron. Last De
cember it was announced that the 
Buhl Foundation granted $300,000 
in support of the project under 
the condition that at least $250,000 
shall be subscribed from other 
sources to build the new-type 
atom smasher.
Small models of the magnetic 
poles have been made under the 
supervision of Dr. E. C. Creutz 
of the physic department as a 
means of studying the problems 
which will be encountered in the 
full size model. The problems to 
be solved in building the cyclo
tron are unusual because there is 
very little previous material 
available to use as a criterion. 
Consequently, the results obtain
ed from the designing of the ac
celerator will necessarily add to 
the existing theories of accurate 
model construction.
One of the main problems at the 
present, which is under the su
pervision of Dr. E. M. Williams, 
associate professor of the elec
trical engineering department, is 
the designing of the oscillator 
section. The new design of the 
oscillator will be different from 
any existing oscillator used for 
such purposes. The vacuum; tubes 
and associated equipment will oc
cupy as much space as one of 
the largest broadcasting stations 
and will supply 600,000 KVA at 
50 KV. The projected oscillator is
12 times as large as the largest 
clear-channel radio station, and 
it poses some interesting problems
in low power factors. The large 
quantities of plumbing will be 
kept to a minimum by efficient de
sign and utilization of supporting 
elements as sections of the oscil
lator.
Millard Gordon, an EE gradu
ate student, is also working on this 
problem in conjunction with 
Harold de Bolt, EE senior, and 
Vincent Prus, EE sophomore, who 
are carrying out calculations in 
connection with the design of the 
oscillator. As may be expected, 
some of the problems become very 
complex. The preliminary models 
are expected to be completed by 
the end of the current semester.

renowned mathematician despite 
the formidable title of the lecture. 
Many enmeshed in the course in 
advanced calculus where *Dr. Courants famous book is used, were 
frankly curioi^s to see what the 
great man looked like. But schol
ars and curious alike were re
warded by a view of an unexplor

Scabbard & Blade 
Announces Names 
Of New Pledg es
The Carnegie chapter of the 
National Society of Scabbard and 
Blade announces the pledging of 
the men named below from the 
ranks of the advanced corps 
ROTC. These men have shown 
themselves to be leaders and have 
demonstrated their proficiency in 
the military sciences.
William Bourke Michael Dripchak Glen Ertell Donald Franz Louis Knipling Donald Lessig John McGuigan 
Robert Prengle Alvin Shafer Graham Smith Alexander Spears Edward Spires William Wallace William Watkins John Watts
Since most of the present active 
members are graduate students 
or May graduates, the present 
pledges will constitute the entire 
chapter by the end of the 
semester. This is as it should be, 
since Scabbard and Blade is pri
marily an undergraduate organi
zation. The present actives are 
ex-army officers who belonged to 
the chapter before the war. It is 
their wish only to re-activate the 
group and pass it on to the cur
rent ROTC student members.
The traditional red, white, and 
blue paddles will soon be seen 
around campus as the pledges 
collect signatures of the actives 
on them. Formal initiation will 
take place in about a month. Later 
in the spring a closed formal 
dance has been tentatively 
scheduled by the fraternity.
Concert Features 
Prof. Lapatnikoff
The third of a series of pro
grams by the Pittsburgh chapter 
of the International Society for 
Contemporary Music will be pre
sented in the Little Theatre on 
Saturday, March 8, at 8:30.
The recital will feature Nicolai 
Lopatnikoff of the department of 
music. Mr. Lopatnikoff, who joined 
the Carnegie Tech faculty as as
sociate professor of theory and 
composition in 1945, has been 
hailed by critics as one of the 
most gifted modern composers. 
His work has been performed by 
the major orchestras of Europe 
and this country under such noted 
conductors as Koussevitsky, Sto

Scarab Begins 
Active Semester
Philae Temple, local branch of 
Scarab, national architectural ho
norary society, is starting the 
spring semester with a rush of 
activity. The annual election of 
officers will be held during the 
second week of March, and will 
be followed by the calling of a 
new pledge class to bring the or
ganization up to its pre-war stand
ing. The highlight of the month 
will be a competition in the fresh
man architectural design class to 
determine the recepient of the 
Scarab Freshman Bronze Medal 
Award.
Philae Temple will make the 
award to the freshman architec
tural student whose design is giv
en first place by the reviewing 
jury. Although the exact nature 
of the problem of the competition 
has not yet been released, it is 
known that it will be a three-orfour-week problem on the design 
of a specific building.
In addition to the above activi
ties, the Scarab-sponsored watercolor exhibition in the Fine Arts 
building closed last Friday. Of 
the 29 works on display, seven 
were the work of students of the 
Carnegie Tech department of ar
chitecture. The exhibit was com
posed of watercolors that had 
been selected from all those en
tered in a recent Scarab national 
sketch competition.
of 17 students, five of whom are 
coeds. Four thousand hours were 
spent in completing the project, 
despite the opinions of profes
sional designers who felt that the 
work would take much longer for 
Richard Felver, assistant pro
fessor of painting and design, as
signed the project and, with asso
ciate professors Fred Clayter and 
Robert Lepper, supervised the 
work.
Most dramatic part of the en
tire problem, the model itself rep
resentes only one-fifth of the 
work done. Careful, thorough 
planning, analysis and research, 
bolstered by queries to 21 out
standing American automobile 
designers and a trip made by one 
student in the class to auto plants 
in Detroit kept the design project 
on a firmly practical level. The 
result is a model which is emi
nently functional, embodying un
usual facilities for passenger com
fort and convenience and a num
ber of entirely new features such 
as greater visibility, serving ac
cessibility, and trunk capacity.
Although the model gleams 
sleek and glittering, resplendent 
in midnight blue finish, the final 
touch is yet to come, with work 
already under way in the class on 
the interior of the little car. Seats 
(completely upholstered), steer
ing wheel, dash panel and other 
appointments will be installed in 
the model as a project for this 
term.

4THE CARNEGIE TARTAN.     - ^------------------------------  -*TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 25, 1947
|>ne of Q
T JL vy Ji
This weeks boy is Cloyd 
Rowe Mellott. At first sight, he 
appeared to be a typical, cleancut Tech student with brown eyes 
and a Pepsodent smile. Then we 
looked at his key chain!
We hardly had to twist his arm 
at all to get the details. He an
swered questions as easily as a
Hollywood publicity man. For in
stance, he said his major interest 
here at school is Lois Williams, 
but we know that every once in 
a while he spends a little time 
being a second semester senior 
in the electrical engineering de
partment.
After graduation, Cloyd will go 
into production engineering, if 
absolutely necessary, but hed 
prefer to stay here at school.
Having been here for five con
secutive semesters, hes grown 
rather fond of ye olde institution. 
When he does look for a job,
Cloyd would like one in the elec
tronics industry, preferably with 
a small company, so that he can
watch it grow and grow right
along with it. Theres a future to 
that.
Cloyd has an impressive battle 
record (naturally). Of his three 
years in service, he spent thirteen 
months in England as the lead 
bombardier of a B-24. He has
twenty-three missions to his cred
it, to say nothing of the Distin
guished Flying Cross, the Air 
Medal with two oak leaf clusters, 
and the Purple Heart. Fortunate
ly, the little affair which won him 
this last decoration hasnt left aiiy 
serious effects.
To take care of any spare time 
he has, Cloyd is engaged in one 
or two activities. The foremost of 
these is Lois Williams. Then there 
are such minor activities as beingchairman of spring carnival, 
chairman of A.I.E.E. last semes
ter, a member of Student Coun
cil for several semesters, a mem
ber of the soccer varsity for twoyears and captain this year, and 
a member of the student liaison, 
committee.
Nor does he slight the honor
ary societies. He belongs to Delta, 
Skull and O.D.K., the junior and 
senior mens honorary societies; 
Eta Kappa Nu, the national elec
trical engineering honorary; Tau 
Beta Pi, Theta Tau, and Sigma Pi 
Sigma, the national physics hon
orary to which he belonged at 
Franklin and Marshall, his pre
vious alma mater.
Cloyd is a fraternity man, but 
since Sigma Pi is not represented 
on this campus, he can usually 
be found at Henderson hall (when 
he isnt home in McConnellsburg, 
Pa., or with Lois Williams).
When we asked him about his 
hobbies, his only answer was, 
Lois Williams. She is a mem
ber of Chi Omega sorority and a 
junior in the P. and D. depart
ment of Fine Arts Colege. It 
seems that Cloyd saw her one 
evening in Skibo last year and 
made up his mind right there and 
then to meet her. Meet her he did 
and since then hes kept the 
sweetest girl Ive ever known 
pretty busy.
The rest of his interests are 
varied. He likes to fish and to 
hunt big game (deer). At the 
other extreme, he also likes good 
music. He himself doesnt play

Reporters Wanted
The Carnegie Tartan cordi
ally invites all undergraduate 
students, especially freshmen 
who are interested in any of 
the phases of newspaper work, 
to report at the Tartan office,, 
third floor of the Carnegie 
Union, on Friday evening at 
7:30, or on Sunday afternoon

WCIT Announces 
Weekly Program
In compliance with its policy 
of adhering to the desires of the 
student audience as expressed in 
a listener survey last semester, 
Carnegie Techs campus radio sta
tion, WCIT, will present the 
Campus Roundtable of the Air 
starting Tuesday, February 25 at 
7:30.
Each week at the same time 
this new series of programs will 
place a question of singular inter
est to CIT students under the 
scrutiny of a board of experts 
consisting of well-known Skibo 
personalities. The topic for dis
cussion in the initial program will 
be: Did Carnegie Tech live up 
to my ideals of a college and of 
college life? The board of ex
perts on this topic will consist of ' 
the following students: Lucille
Emmel, Asher Etkes, Frank Clov
er, and Bob Straka. The program 
will be moderated by Jack John
son.
In an attempt to make it possi
ble to bring more and better serv
ice to its listeners, WCIT broad
casted its first commercially spon
sored program at 7:30 last Fri
day. During the past semester 
the station was supported by 
funds from Student Council but, 
with the beginning of this semes
ters classes, it has been put on its 
own. This has necessitated the 
acquisition of funds from com
mercial advertisements. The pol
icy of the station, however, will 
still be the presentation of pro
grams of particular interest to 
students and actual commercial 
time will be kept at a minimum.
Prof. B. Iden Payne Returns*
To Direct Shakespeare Play
B. Iden Payne, internationally 
known Shakespearian director 
and producer, has again arrived 
on the Carnegie Tech campus to 
direct the annual department of 
drama production of one of the 
Bards ever-living plays, King 
Lear.
Long associated with the CIT 
department of Drama, Professor 
Payne has been directing and 
producing Shakespeare in the 
Little Theatre every year since 
1919 with a few exceptions caused 
by the press of duties as the di
rector of the Shakespeare Memo
rial Theatre at Stratford-on-Avon, 
JEngland.
Interviewed after his arrival on 
campus, the veteran actor-director reaffirmed his strong interest 
in the welfare of the drama de
partment. He further stated that 
of all the drama schools he has 
foeen associated with, the depart
ment at Carnegie Tech is the best 
^balanced in curriculum and or
ganization. Professor Payne be
lieves that the manner in which 
this school concentrates on actor 
training without diminishing the

importance of the other elements 
of the theatre is without parallel 
in dramatic schools.
Professor Payne made his first 
appearance on the boards in Eng
land in 1899, and by 1907 had be
come the director and producer 
of a repertory company at Man
chester. He came to America in 
1913 and was associated with sev
eral prominent theatrical organ
izations including the Fine Arts 
Theatre; the Goodman Repertory 
Theatre, Charles Frohman, Inc.; 
and the Theatre Guild. Before re
turning to England in 1934 to di
rect the Shakespeare Memorial 
Theatre, he headed the depart
ment of drama at CIT for three 
years.
In addition to his lectures and 
current directorial duties in con
nection with the forthcoming 
production of King Lear, Professor 
Payne is heading the drama de
partment at the University of 
Texas.

TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 25, 1947THE CARNEGIE TARTAN6
Allegheny Succumbs to Tartans 59-53
Geneva Trounces Tech Quintet Intramural 
In Listless Contest. 50-36
For the whole first half of the 
basketball game last Wednesday 
night at the Tech gym it looked 
as though the Tartan Basketeers 
had finally found an opponent in 
their class as they battled a visit
ing Geneva team on even terms. 
But the responsibility of only 
trailing by 3 points proved too 
much for them, and in the second 
half they returned to form to 
lose the game by a score of 50- 
36.
With Mike Theodore running up 
4 quick points for the Scots at 
the opening whistle it looked for 
a while as though Tech was back 
on the sparsely travelled victory 
road. And when some sharp pass
ing kept the Covenanters back on 
their Iheels and forced Coach 
Slim Ransom to substitute a 
whole new team to try and stop 
the rush,* 700 die-hard fans pre
sent began to sit up and take 
notice. But it wasnt long before 
the passing bogged down and the 
shooting returned to normalcy. 
With the Skibos unable to take 
advantage of the second-stringers, 
the return of the revitalized first 
team at the beginning of the sec
ond half proved to much and the 
Covies pretty well wrapped the 
game up as the third quarter as 
they ran wild to score 19 points 
to the Tartans 5.
Theodore opened the scoring 
with an overhead shot from the 
side for 2 points and followed 
that quickly with a set shot from 
the center for 2 more. DeVenzio 
of the visitors matched this with
2 field goals to knot the score at
4-4. Gugino then converted both 
ends of a foul to put the Covies 
in the lead. But the score was soon 
tied up again as Mel Klein hit 
from the outside. Katsellas put 
the Tartans out in front with 2 
charity tosses followed by an
other by Clougherty, and the 
quarter ended with Geneva scor
ing a two-pointer to bring the 
score to 9-8.
George Meyers was continually 
breaking up the Covenanters fast 
break and Coach Ransom found 
it necessary to substitute a whole 
new team and change the strate
gy. The 5 substitutes displayed a 
ragged brand of ball but the 
Tartans couldnt take advantage 
of ' an evident superiority and 
were outscored in the second 
quarter by 4 points.
' Firestone carried the majority 
of the burden for the visitors dur
ing this canto as he rang up 7 
points on 3 field goals and a 
foul. Theodore continued his hot 
pace with 4 more points to keep 
the Tartan's in the running. The 
score was tied three times at 
9-9, 12-12 and 14-14. But a final
Womens Rifle Team

spurt found Geneva enjoying a
3 point advantage at the half by 
a score of 18-15.
Being relegated to the bench 
en masse must have done some
thing to Genevas first team be
cause they set a dizzy pace with 
the beginning of the second half 
as the first six shots they threw 
up were good. By the time they 
finally missed the score was 28- 
15 and Tech was virtually out 
of the ball game. The hot pace 
continued as the Covies put on a 
brilliant passing display to score 
9 more points before the end of 
the quarter and bring the score 
to 37-20. During that period the 
only scoring for the Tartans was
2 field goals by Katsellas and a 
foul by Clougherty.
During the fourth period they 
kept right on going and by the 
time it was over they had fallen 
just one point short of their to
tal in the last contest between 
the two teams in which the Covies 
had triumphed 51-36. Midway in 
this period an error (?) by the 
scoreboard attendant found the 
Skibos with 80 points instead of 
30. But nobody mindeddreaming 
can be so pleasant at times.
Plaid Swimmers 
Score Victory
In a week of hectic activity, 
Carnegie Techs swimming team 
showed their class by beating 
Washington and Jefferson before 
succumbing to Fenn Colleges

Gaining first place in all events 
except the 400 yard free style 
relay, Carnegie Techs swimmers 
soundly trounced Washington and 
Jefferson, 52-23, in the Tech pool 
Tuesday. Top man for the Tar
tans was Herb Venzer with 2 
victories, one in the 50 yd. free
style and the other in the 100 yd. 
freestyle. Other firsts were 
Schroeder Ferguson and Luckey 
in the 300 yd. medley, Spangler 
in the 220 yd. freestyle, Schroe

Yoller in the 200 yd. breast stroke,

Roundup
This week the aggressive, bas
ket-scoring Betas head the list of 
unbeaten teams still in potential 
position for the league crown. The 
Beta A team, led by Vince Pruce 
and Tom Kirby, smothered the 
winless A.S.C.E. 51-26. This is 
the second time they have hit the 
50 mark. At the same time the 
Beta B team had a light Workout 
with the Dorm Combine, winning 
only by a score of 52-21.
SAEs, Hotshots Win
In the American League the
S.A.E.s remained unbeaten when 
they gave the D.U.s their first 
taste of defeat 33-25. However, the
D.U.s have protested the game, 
the refereeing of which was de
bated.
Keeping pace with the S.A.E.s 
are the Hotshots who managed to 
get past a tough one by beating 
the F.P.H.A. 36-33. The Hot Rocks 
also won a close game from the 
Emanons 38-33, while the Beta 
Sigs took an easy affair from the 
T.X. B team 42-25. The T.X. A 
team almost lost a tough game to 
the PiKAs as they won with just 
two points to pare 27-25.
At the same time in the Na
tional League the Betas, T.N.T. 
and Kappa Sigs all hold records 
of two victories. T.N.T. dropped 
the Phi Kaps 36-28, the Kappa

Theodore Proves Sparkplug 
For Skibos Second Victory
Saturday night saw the Tar
tans take their second win of the 
season with a 59-53 upset of Al
legheny College. After dropping 
seven contests in a row, the Plaids 
finally hit their stride as Leo 
Clougherty, Mike Theodore, and 
Tasso Katselas teamed together 
to give Tech its victory.
Tech opened the scoring with a
league the Splits have maintained 
a game average of roughly 800 
pins all season. They also hold 
the record for the best three game 
total with 2488 pins and the cur
rent' leading bowler in Donald 
Klein with a 170 average.
The Tau Delts and Betas are 
still where they were last week 
deadlocked. The Tau Delts took 
three games from the D.U.s while 
the Betas had little trouble beat
ing Kilroy when only three men 
appeared to face them.
In the other games on the lanes 
the S.A.E.s beat the Combine-2
3-0, the Delt-1 won three from 
Sigma Nu-2, the T.X.s managed 
to get two out of three from the 
PiKAs and Delt-2 fell three times 
before the Phi Kaps.
Ralph Reich Rolls 250
It seemed like 200 games were 
the order of the day last Satur
day with Ralph Reich of the Sig
ma Nus leading the parade with 
a 250 game which is the closest 
anyone has come all season to the 
perfect 300 game. Bill Swaney of 
the Splits was the real man of 
the day, however, with a total of 
597 pins for three games. Andy 
Cambal of the Phi Kaps hit an 
even 200, while Paul Weber of 
the Delt-1 hit the jackpot twice 
with two 211 games.
two pointer by Mel Klein. The 
lead never left our Hands after 
this point, and at the end of a fast 
first quarter the score showed 
Tech ahead by two points. The 
game was won in the second per
iod as the Plaids went hog wild 
and scored twenty-one points to 
Alleghenys eleven. The fine work 
of Mike Theodore. Mel Klein, 
and George Meyer was respon
sible for this, as Tech had com
plete control of the backboards in 
this period and scored almost at 
will.
The third period opened with 
the score at 36-23, and this thir
teen point lead was needed to 
carry us through. Foul shooting 
highlighted this period with Alle
gheny superior in the duel. The 
lead was cut to a mere four points 
at the end of this quarter, but 
Mike Theodore came through in 
the clutch. This hectic last period 
saw Leo Clougherty go out on 
fouls after scoring fourteen points 
on four field goals and six fouls. 
When the going got tough Mike 
Theodore dumped four quick ones 
through the hoop to put the game 
on ice for the Tartans. The final 
whistle showed Tech in the lead 
by a comfortable six points.
Theodore and Clougherty were 
top scorers on the floor with fif
teen and fourteen points respec
tively, and Hileman was the big 
gun for Allegheny with his thir
teen points. The twelve points 
scored by Tasso Katselas helped 
Tech roll up their fifty-nine 
points, which was the largest to
tal of the season.

Top Dollar Johnny. In the last 
few weeks he has sold two cars to 
fraternity brothers and is now 
walking himself.
Doug Fields was walking on air 
last weekend. Reasonhis O.A.O. 
was down from up near Beantown. The occasion was a semiformal dance on Saturday, given 
by the new actives. Dan Kahl 
wasnt at the dance, however. He 
was up in Auburn, N. Y., having 
the knot tied with Dorothy Hopko.
Sigma Nus held their formal 
initiation in the Black Cat on 
Sunday afternoon, February 16, 
and followed it by a banquet in 
the University Room of the Web

Students Snafu 
Cars With Snow
Into the peaceful atmosphere of 
snow-covered Margaret Morrison 
street burst forty dorm men, sev
eral dorm women, and a school 
employee armed to the eyeballs 
with shovels and brooms.
The fellows shoveled the snow 
from in front of the Inn with a 
vengeance (just try to get them 
to do that any other time), pil
ing it in the middle of street 
until they had erected a snow 
block three feet high and three 
feet wide. They then coated the 
structure with water and sat back 
to watch the fun.
The blockade did a good job of 
tying up traffic, but one particu
larly determined Buick managed 
to break through. Suddenly the 
alarm was sounded! As Dean War
den approached, the crowd scat
tered like buckshot, all but twelve 
extremely unfortunate individuals 
who were trampeled in the rush. 
The Dean complimented the boys 
on their excellent construction job 
and advised them to get the 
blamed thing out of there im
mediately.
At this point Dean Dickinson 
joined the party, grabbed a shovel, 
and started pitching snow with 
the rest of the demolition squad.
Although the fellows had plan
ned a repeat performance for 
1:00 a. m., they were just too tired 
to go through with it. The snow 
block has been completely remov
ed, but everyone concerned insists 
that it was fun while it lasted.

Several new couples were seen 
at the PiKA open house last Fri
day night, mainly Jim Trautman 
and Pat Adams, Jim Dinwiddie 
and Olive Gallaher, and LoHy 
Anderson and Ella Baum.
Among the growing list of 
Delts to lose their pins we find: 
Grad Augie Binder recently pin
ned to Marion Urling (of Pitt) no 
less!); Moldy Watkins to Lura 
Johnston of West Virginia univer
sity (mountaineers always stick 
together); Fred Frank to Lois 
Brunn, president of Sigma Kap
pa sorority; and Barry Rowles to 
a gal back home in Minnesota.
The Delts are becoming widely 
known as good men to have 
around. Last Friday they compos
ed the male element at two par
ties: one at PCW and another at 
Mount Mercy.
The new initiates to ATO now 
include: Stewart Russell, Gwen

Bridge has increased in popu

th informal dance on February

their feet on the floor and their 
elbows on the you-know-what in 
the course of the evening.

has a normal American appetite, 
which means that he eats almost 
anything fit for normal human 
consumption. This includes most 
of the food in Skibo. Strangely 
enough, he doesnt like Worces

Being quite normal, Cloyd ad
mits there are a few things here 
at school that annoy him. First 
among these is the lack of sup
port of athletics by the adminis

the backstroke position, all with
a modicum of effort.
The boys werent quite as for
tunate Saturday, however, as they 
lost a particularly close meet at 
Fenn College of Cleveland by the 
score of 41-34. Going into the last 
event of the program with the 
score tied at 34 points each, the 
Fenn team of Harmon, Mack, 
Laub and Busbey won the 400 
yd. freestyle relay to capture the 
meet. It was almost to be ex
pected, since the 400 yd. freestyle 
relay has been Techs weakest 
event and an habitual cause of 
worry. The Tartans firsts were 
Luckey, Spangler and Schroeder 
in the 300 yd. medley relay, Lee 
in the diving and Luckey in the 
200 yd. breast stroke. Kosmetos 
of Fenn was the individual stand
out, winning three events.
Ria Ginster and Howard L. 
Worner are recent newcomers to 
the faculty of the College of Fine 
Arts. Miss Ginster, celebrated 
European soprano, will serve the 
department of music as visiting 
professor of voice for the pres
ent semester. Mr. Worner has 
been appointed assistant profes
sor in the department of painting 
and design.
Miss Ginster, a native of Frank
fort, Germany, has been head of 
the voice department at the Con
servatory of Music at Zurich, 
Switzerland, since 1947. In 1935- 
36 she made her first American 
concert tour, which was received 
by the critics and the public with 
enthusiasm. The following year 
she completed another equally 
successful tour ip this country.
Possessor of a lyric voice of 
great purity, Miss Ginster has ap
peared as soloist with famous or
chestras in Europe under many 
noted conductors, including Furt
wngler, Sir Thomas Beecham, 
and Bruno Walter. In this coun
try she has sung with the New 
York Philharmonic Orchestra un
der Barbirolli and with the Chica
go Symphony under Frederick 
Stock.
During her sojourn at Carnegie 
Tech she will give individual in
struction to students of the department of music.
Professor Worner, well-known 
Pennsylvania commercial artist 
and World War II veteran with 
overseas service, comes to C.I.T. 
from the advertising department 
of the Armstrong Cork Company 
at Lancaster, Pa., where he was 
engaged in art direction.
A graduate of the Philadelphia 
Museum School of Industrial Art, 
he studied under Thorton Oakley, 
Earl Horter, Henry C. Ditz, 
Franklin Watkins, and Alexedy 
Brodovitch.
Following graduation and a 
period of free lance work, he 
worked with the Pennsylvania 
Game Commission designing pos
ters, and served the federal gov
ernment as assistant head of the 
Museum Extehsion Project.
Professor Worners extensive 
and varied experience in the field 
of graphic arts has endowed him 
with a fund of practical know
how that he intends to pass on 
to the students of the painting 
and design department.

Tm a regular Scotsman for thrift. I never throw away anything that I 
can use again;
"Every year I salvage millions and millions of pounds of metal from what 
you might call junk.
"I collect all the old telephone equipment, wire and cable no longer useful 
to the Bell System ... and all the machine scrap, turnings and rejected parts 
from the factories where I make Bell Telephone equipment.
"I turn this scrap metal into bars and billets of refined metals and alloys 
out of which I make new telephone equipment.
*I salvage rubber, textiles and paper, too : ; . and anything I cant use 
again, I sell. Nothing is wasted.

Engineers Finish 
Banquet Plans
Preparations are now Under
way for the thirty-second Annual 
Banquet of the Evening College 
of Engineering. It will be held at 
Hotel Fort Pitt on Saturday eve
ning, April 12, 1947.
In former years the banquet 
cost $3.00 per person, but due to 
increased costs of all food and 
services, it appears that this years 
affair will have to cost $3.75. This 
may seem too high for many of 
you but the cost of the meal plus 
tip is going to be $3.03. The re
mainder of the price will be eaten 
up by entertainment, a flower cen
ter piece for the table, postage, 
and some small incidentals.

consist of fresh vegetable soup,

Rosemary Eckles; the new comer

wonder why Chester didnt want 
us to mention who held his head 
while who bandaged his finger 
which he got mixed in with a 
high-voltage socket? Tell us, 
Ches. We wont say anything 
. . . And, gosh! Have we got 
ambition. On Thursday (the night 
of the big snow) there were all 
sorts of people out at Thistle Hall 
to decorate for the dance. Among 
the interesting was George, up in 
the clouds - or should we say 
rafters. Honestly, we wonder why 
in the world he didnt get dizzy, 
give up and take the fatal plunge 
and end it all. Then there was 
Johnnie (we wonder where he is 
tonight) looking for the stapler 
which was never there nor work
ing. And Ann, with that wideeyed lost expression, just roam
ing around doing just about every
thing along the line of little

The modern Cinderella of the 
Tech campus is Olive Baumgard
ner, for Olive (shell also an
swer to O. B.) is continuously 
challenged with the threat of 
missing the 12 oclock bus to Ir
win, Pennsylvania. Although she 
has a fondness for her home town,
brownette who has attended Eve
ning School for the past three 
years and is now a student in the 
class on the Psychology of Ad
justment. She has been a member 
of Student Council for the past 
two and one-half years, received 
her second Insignia Award this 
winter, is a member of the newly 
founded Evening School Womens 
Organization, and has been lend
ing a helping hand in this and 
that extra-curricular activity as 
often as her Cinderella limitations 
will allow.
Her tastes for sports is obvious 
to any who watch her enthusiastic 
response to baseball, basketball, 
football, and hockey games. Her 
likes include dancing and bowling; 
and at times one can detect the 
makings of a bridge fiend in her. 
She very strangely mixes an aver
sion of household activities with 
a liking for sewing, knitting and 
the culinary arts. As a matter of 
fact, one of the courses which she 
enjoyed most at Carnegie Tech 
I was a class in cooking which she 
attended at Maggie Murph. And 
then, there are a host of other ac
tivities which she enjoys, a few 
of which are going for drives on 
the Turnpike, seeing all the best 
shows in town, and utterly disre
garding the diet she claims she 
has adopted.
The slipper of opportunity that 
O. B. has found in Pittsburgh has 
proved a perfect fit for herself 
as well as Carnegie Tech.

Mr. Carra received the degree 
of master of fine arts from Yale 
and returned to Harvard to act 
as guest director for the Harvard 
Dramatic Theatre in their produc
tion of a show similar to the 
Scotch and Soda musical. He then 
joined the Northwestern univer
sity drama faculty and, during his 
stay there, guest directed for the 
Federal Theatre Project in New 
Jersey and Wells College, New 
York.
The drama department of the 
University of Texas^was the next 
user of Mr. Carras talents, and 
it was there that he gained most 
of his varied experience. In ad
dition to teaching and direction 
of several shows, he staged mu
sical comedies and operettas at 
the San Antonio Civic Opera, and 
operas with the Houston Sym
phony Orchestra.
During his work at the Univer
sity of Texas, Mr. Carra noticed 
the almost total lack of theatre in 
all but the largest cities of the

this and to create work for many
