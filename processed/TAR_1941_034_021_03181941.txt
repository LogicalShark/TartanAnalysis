Last Thursday Bill Eythe, 
Drama 41, came close to the 
realization of a nightmare that 
every actor has had. The dream is 
that of being pushed out on the 
stage, in front of a waiting au
dience, to play a part that he 
had never seen before. But Bill 
wasnt quite in that situation 
he had been studying the part 
of Macheath, male lead in The 
. Beggars Opera for not quite 
.twenty-four hours.
Carl Betz, 43, who rehearsed 
the part, was taken to the hos
pital on Wednesday afternoon, 
after he had played one perform
ance. Wednesday evenings show 
had to be cancelled, and it was 
then that Bill started learning the 
part. He had never read the script 
or seen a rehearsal of The Beg
gars Opera until' then. Playing 
Macheath entailed learning about 
six solo songs and as many dances.
To make everything completely 
complicated, until last Friday Bill 
was under contract to appear in 
a fashion show at one of the 
downtown stores. This meant that 
he had to dash from the fashion 
show into a waiting car, put on his 
costume in the car, and arrive at 
the Little Theatre in time to make 
his entrance as Macheath. The in
termission, normally between the 
first and second acts, was placed 
immediately before his entrance in 
the first act, to give him more 
time. Last Friday, he had to play 
the matinee; rush downtown at 
once to the fashion show, and 
then tear back to Tech for the 
evening performance.
The part is a large one, and it 
would have been impossible for 
Billor anyoneto learn all the 
lines as well as the songs and 
dances in time for Thursdays 
performance. So that night, after 
Mr. Boettcher, Drama Department 
head, had made the situation 
known to the audience, Bill play
ed his show with the lines pasted 
on cards and on his propsthere 
were lines on the table tops and 
slips of paper pasted on the beer 
mug with which he enters in one 
scene.
The audience, prepared to make
Freshman Girls 
Establish New 
Campus Sorority
Student Council has approved 
the petition of Mu Gamma Alpha 
for recognition as a new sorority. 
However the sorority will not be
come a member of Inter-Sorority 
. Council until next October at 
which time it will have existed a 
yeara prerequisite for member
ship.
The group has been functioning 
for some time now and is well 
organized. It is comprised of ten 
commuters and five dormitory 
girls. The officers are: Louise Saul, 
president; Eleanor Galinski, vice' president; Jean Lichter, secretary; 
and Shirley Lehrer, treasurer. The 
sorority has a three-fold purpose, 
and has drawn up temporary 
plans for the future. It intends 
to aid the Deans office wherever 
it can. The sorority plans to do 
service work which is now mani
fested by the members knitting 
for the British. It also intends to 
sponsor and participate in social 
activities.
The fifteen members are all 
freshmen of Margaret Morrison 
and the Fine Arts Schools. The 
rushing rules have not been drawn 
up as yet, but they will conform 
to the standards set by Inter-Sor
ority Council. Since Margaret 
Morrison takes only sophomores, 
the girls are undecided whether 
to rush next year from their own 
class members or to wait another 
year in order that they may take 
in members from the present frosh 
class.
All members of the present sority have a factor over 2.00the 
average factor being 2.7.

allowances, found that there 
werent many to make. True, 
there was a thirty-five minute in
termission because of a delay in 
town, but they received Bills per
formance enthusiastically, and dis
covered that after the first few 
minutes the script he carried was 
not noticeable.
Those people who had tickets 
for last Wednesdays performance 
will be able to use them tomor

Voder Mimics 
Human Voice
Human speech requires skill
fully coordinated motions of the 
lips, jaws, vocal . chords, and 
tongue. In the past, attempts to 
imitate human ispeech involved 
purely rrfechanical meansvibrat
ing reeds, tuning forks, and organ 
pipes. The Voder (Voice Operation 
Demonstrator) represents the first 
artificial creation of basic sounds 
and conversion of these sounds in
to words by the use of electrical 
apparatus.
The Voder and its operation, a 
part of the Worlds Fair Exhibit 
of the Bell Telephone Company, 
will be featured at the Tau Beta 
Pi assembly in the Carnegie Music 
Hall on March 25. Dr. Perrine 
will devote a portion of his lecture-demonstration to a discus
sion of the character of speech 
sounds, their analyses and syn
theses, and the electrical means 
for creating speech-like sounds.
Parts Of Apparatus
Fundamentally, the apparatus is 
an electrical arrangement cor
responding to the human speech 
mechanism in structure and com
pleteness. It was designed in the 
Bell Telephone Research Labora
tories and, except for the keys, is 
built entirely of appartus used in 
everyday telephone service.
The transportable Voder 
equipment is arranged in four 
separate sections. First is the con
trol board or console, the picture 
of which appeared in last weeks 
TARTAN. In the second part are 
two vacuum tube audio frequen
cy generators which produce the 
electric currents.
The third section, consisting of 
regular and emergency amplifiers, 
together with the public address 
microphones and input controls, 
is mounted in . another cabinet. 
Two 750 loud speakers, the lat
est types in high fidelity loud 
speakers of the Bell System de
sign, comprise the fourth section.
Sound Formation
In the synthesizer, located in 
the second section, there is an 
electrical source which supplies 
a steady sound stream resembling 
a radiator sizzle for shaping into 
the two kinds of human speech 
sounds. By pressing the proper 
combination of keys, the operator 
shapes the sound stream into the 
proper electrical curernt for mak
ing any of the desired sounds.
This Voder applies the prin
ciple of sending speech sounds by 
telegraphic means, signals which 
actuate synthesizing equipment. 
The electrical apparatus approxi
mates in a similar degree the flex
ibility and stability of the human 
voice apparatus.

Spanish Swing 
Its the Thing
By Jim Sions
This Thursday, from 4:30 to 
6:30, the Spanish Swing will 
mark the opening of a new era in 
Carnegie Tech social life. The 
new social order will mean the 
coming of more, better, and dif
ferent social events. No longer 
will Tech students have to take a 
date to the show on Saturday 
night. Heavens no! There will be 
too many better things right here 
on Campus.
Please do not make the mistake 
of thinking the Spanish swing is 
just another tea dance, because 
it is to cost 20c per person and be 
held in Thistle Hall at tea-time. 
The Spanish Swing is to be en
tirely different for the following 
reasons:
1Jimmv Stewart with his 15 
piece orchestra, which has a rep
utation for good sweet and 
swing, is to provide the music. 
PCW, Ellis School, and Shadyside 
Academy are just a few of the 
schools that would be glad to 
recommend him. And before we 
forget, Jimmy has a real vocalist, 
Dottie Hippie.
2There will be no girl stag 
line at the Swing. An entirely new 
system of mixing the couples has 
been arranged. This will allow the 
fellows to dance with any girl 
they want and yet neither the boy 
or girl will ever get stuck.
3Student Council is sponsor
ing the Swing in cooperation with 
the sororities, honoraries and 
Mens and Womens Dormitory 
Council. With such assistance the 
Swing cant be anything but a 
success.
If you want to do something for 
the school, if you want to meet 
the Boy or the Girl, or if you 
just want to dance, be at the 
Spanish Swing. We are coming 
just to see what happens. Why 
dont you?
Benefit Supper
The Womens Club supper for 
British War Relief will be served 
in Carnegie Commons Saturday, 
March 22, at 6:30 P. M. Students 
or any other persons desiring to 
attend will be welcome. Tickets 
are 65c for adults; 45c for children.
Reservations should be in not 
later than Thursday, March 20, 
and should be made by writing or 
telephoning Mrs. O. O. Kuentz, 
HI land 6859, or Mrs. B. R. Teare, 
PEnhurst 1863. Tickets will also 
be sold in the Cashiers Office, Administration Hall.
After supper there will be danc
ing and cards in the Exhibition 
Room, College of Fine Arts.

Tech is now to have its own pic
torial newspaper, it was revealed 
last week by William Mercier, 
provisional editor-in-chief. The 
publication is as yet unnamed.
Many persons have felt the need 
of a campus newspaper in pictures 
to supplement the work of the 
other publications. It will be the 
purpose of this publication to pro
mote good will among all the 
campus associations and to give 
the average Carnegie student an 
opportunity to see, in pictures, all 
phases of campus life.
Others who will be associated 
with the infant publication in one 
capacity or another are: Roy Erteli, Dan Horigan, Thomas Riley, 
Robert Griffin, Dorothy Piper, 
Charles Richardson, Fred Kindi, 
James Frew, Frances Carlock, Al
vin Burton, David Ellis, Edward 
Rechberger, Arthur Rappun. This 
staff is expected to. be increased.
The publication will be selffinanced by private investments, 
advertisements, and circulation 
income. The price will be five 
cents a copy.
Pictures will be accompanied 
by short. news stories. The best 
pictures contributed will be print
ed.
March 27 has been tentatively 
set as the date for the first issue.

Year-Round School?
A practical defense plan to ex
pedite the graduation of engineer
ing and technical students has 
recently been proposed. The plan 
will, in effect, lengthen the actual 
school year from nine to twelve 
monthsin other words, the three 
months summer vacation will be 
replaced by a third semester. 
Thus, it will be possible to com
plete the customary four years in 
three. This plan was formulated 
because the Army and Navy need 
engineers and need them soon!
Although haste is veiy import
ant, the contemplated change in
volves serious difficulties. A great 
many students find it necessary to 
work during the summer in order 
to obtain sufficient funds to at
tend school the ensuing year. 
Aside from the financial angle, 
much invaluable experience is 
gained through summer jobs, and 
the experience adds materially to 
an engineering education.
The new plan will encounter 
another stumbling block in sum
mer school. If full-time classes are 
to be held during the summer, 
it will be impossible to conduct 
summer school. The seriousness of 
such a step can readily be seen 
by glancing at the large enroll
ment in Techs summer school, 
and by considering the large num
ber of regular students who find
it necessary to attend the summer 
session. Moreover, the required 
shop courses at the end of the 
Freshman year, and the R. O. T.
C. camp at the end of the Junior 
year will have to be eliminated.
The most serious barrier to
ward the curtailing of the vaca
tions, however, is the deleterious 
effect "it will have on the engin
eering curriculum. As it stands, 
the curriculum is so organized as 
to offer the most necessary cours
es and as many of them as can be 
successfully fitted into a fouryear college course. The concen
tration of the four-year program 
into three will necessitate its re
vision and will result in lowering 
the scholastic standard of the 
school. In short, the present cur
riculum is geared to produce as 
highly trained engineers as is pos
sible and the proposed change 
would defeat this objective.
A poll of student opinion con
cerning the speeding up of the 
college course was taken at Penn 
State. Sixty and one-half percent 
of the engineers were in favor of 
it, eleven and one-half percent 
were unfavorable, and twentyeight percent were undecided. Al
though no poll has been taken here 
at Tech, the new proposal has 
been received, on the whole, un
favorably.

Latest Fashions 
To Be Featured 
In Annual Show
Techs annual fashion parade 
and style show will take place 
this year in Kaufmanns eleventh 
floor auditorium on March 27, 
28 and 29. Three afternoon shows 
will be given at 2:00 P. M., and 
possibly one evening show on the 
28th; The clothes are made and 
modeled by the upper-clasamen In 
the Costume Economics Depart
ment.
This year's fashion show will 
feature color and in each scene 
only one color will predominate. 
In order of presentation the col
ors chosen are: mauve to brown, 
blue, green, and intense spectral, 
colors. As usual, everything from 
bathing suits, shorts, and robes 
to afternoon dresses and formals 
will be modeled. The last scene 
will be patriotic in character, the 
colors being red, white and blue 
combinations; and a military wed
ding will be featured in the true 
military spirit.
The bride will wear a white 
satin suit, pearl epaulettes, and 
a short tulle veil. Betty Shanor, a 
junior in the department, has 
been chosen to be this years bride. 
There will be nine R. O. T. C. 
officers participating in the wed
ding, namely: Robert Beck, James 
Cullen, Edmund Chaffey, Tom 
Day, Robert Flaherty, Karl Fing
er, John Polick, Joseph Salisbury 
and Richard Weber.
Kaufmanns supplies the ma
terials, accessories, and patterns 
for the costumes. The girls, under 
the direction of the Costume Ec
onomics Faculty, choose their cos
tumes and complete them under 
departmental supervision during 
a five weeks period. They are 
graded on their costumes, and af
ter the show is over, are allowed 
to keep them.
Uncle Sam Runs 
Tech Post Office
No longer will Tech students 
be obliged to travel down to the 
Oakland Postoffice to cash money 
orders or to register mail. A con
tract was granted to Tech, estab
lishing a United States Postoffice 
in the basement of Administra
tion Hall.
What was once known as a 
postofflce was nothing more than 
a place for the sorting and d*3 
tribution of mail. Now, in addi
tion to its former functions, the 
postofflce' will take care of all 
money orders and will be in 
charge of registered mail. Funds 
for buying stamps, formerly pro
vided for by the school, will be 
under the care of the Govern
ment.
The first postofflce at Tech was 
established in 1914 and was locat
ed across from the front steps of 
Administration Hall. Later it was 
moved downstairs to its present 
location. Mrs. Wagner, who has 
taken care of the Tech mail for 
nine years, will continue to be in 
charge as head of Techs United

Close Harmony, which was to 
have been staged by members of 
Techs faculty in the Little The
atre this Friday evening, has been 
postponed indefinitely.
The action was taken because 
the use of the stage would have 
hindered the members of the 
Drama Department in the rehears
als for their next production. Or
iginally the Dramats had given 
the faculty the use of the stage 
and had even offered their serv
ices during the rehearsals, but it 
soon became apparent that the 
schedules of the Drama Depart
ment would conflict with the fac
ultys use of the Theatre.
It is hoped that the play may 
be given sometime in May, but as 
yet no definite plans have been 
made.

zTHE CARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY, MARCH 18, 1941
After The War MT Over Then What ?
Wc are all for defeating Hitler if the victors are ready to 
substitute something better in his j)lacc. After many months of 
war, however, there is still no indication of what will be produced 
as a peace treaty. Have we a right to hope that the leaders of 
Englandand the United States intend to insure democracy 
throughout the world?
Certainly the failure to state war aims, or more accurately 
peace aims/ should make us a little suspicious of Downing 
Street and the 'White House.
Wc have heard a good deal about defending demoracy, 
but the word democracy is coming to mean less than the word 
honortt that served our ancestors as an excuse to shed blood. 
Leland Stowe permits himself the bald misstatement that Greece 
is a democracy. It wasB. C. Today the Greeks (who, all 
propagandists notwithstanding, are not the descendants of the 
glorious fighters of Thermopolae, Marathon, etc., etc.) live under 
an unvarnished dictatorship.
Mr. Henry A. Wallace, in a radio speech, refers to the South 
American countries as brother democracies and no one rises 
to contradict him, although every high school student knows that 
a South American democracy is harder to find than a needle in a 
haystack.
Interventionists and Anglophiles have conveniently forgotten 
that both Franklin Roosevelt and the British Government did 
their part to scuttle Spanish democracy when it was fighting for 
its life againstvFranco. It will be remembered that the embargo 
which was repealed to help Britain was passed to help Franco.
The rate at which the liberties of the American people are 
being curtailed will apparently soon be accelerated. Colonel 
William Draper told a University of Michigan audience that too 
long as a nation we have coddled our liberties, our rights, and our 
privileges . . . Strange words indeed from one who is sup
posedly leading us in the defense of these coddled rights.
All this indicates that it is something over and above a 
struggle for democracy which is now being fought. Some 
American leaders are perfectly willing to see American democ
racy give way to a war dictatorship in order to fight Hitler more 
efficiently. Others are using the defense situation as a pretext to 
divorce us from our coddled rights and privileges. ( Neither 
attitude jibes with the loud talk about defending democracy.
Good or bad, the Germans seem to know what they are 
fighting for, whereas the English and Americans are not even quite 
sure what they are fighting against. This seems, in part', a source 
of Hitlers strength. A clear exposition of war aims might make 
the German people stop and think. After all, what is good for us 
might also be conceivably good for them.
We are ccrtainly entitled to a clear outspoken declaration 
of what, the next peace is going to be like. We are getting a little 
bit fed up with generalities about defense of democracy, God 
and Country, Glorious Traditions, etc. That stuff is good 
enough for answering a question on a Social Studies exam. When 
it comes to reasons for waging war, we like them with more 
meat on them.

oclock in the Union. Juniors

and activity in Phi Kappa Phi. 
have also been invited.
The program will consist of a 
panel discussion of the subject, 
Student Problems in the World

panel, who' are: Professors Edith 
M. Winchester, chairman; William 
Work, Douglas Miner, and John

floor.
The tea is being supervised by 
a committee consisting of: Eleonore Asp, chairman; Loraine El
der, Martha Chersky, Jeanne Fox, 
Frances Coon ,Ed Kaplan, John 
Huffman, and Millard Levy.

Council Approves 
Weekly Pictorial; 
New Sorority
A new weeidy will soon make 
its appearance on the campus. At 
its last meeting Student Council 
approved and accepted a petition 
asking for permission to publish a 
weekly pictorial. The function of 
the weekly is to cover all the nowneglected phases of campus life. 
Cameras will be seen in every 
nook and comer of the campus so 
as to show all parts of a students 
life. The pictorial will be published 
privately by a combine of frater
nity men and will be sold for five 
cents a copy.
Mr. Jacobson, 41, raised the ob
jection that this paper might in
terfere with the three organiza
tions, TARTAN, Scottie, and 
Thistle, in that they would take 
away some of the advertising bus
iness. In order to offset any such 
conflict, a motion was made and 
passed that the new publishers be 
prohibited from soliciting ads from 
any place that has given business 
to these school organizations in 
the past year. This was agreeable 
to the publishers.
Mu Alpha Gamma, a social so
rority, applied for recognition to 
Council and was accepted. The 
sorority is composed of fifteen 
girls, all freshmen from Margaret 
Morrison or Art School. Due to 
the fact that the sorority has a 
different rushing season than the 
other sororities, the matter will 
have to come up before Intersor
ority Council.
The important subject of elec
tion rules was discussed with re
gard to revising the constitution. 
In the past electioneers have al
ways been in the vicinity of the 
polls, causing much confusion at 
the voting places. To prevent this 
from recurring, a motion was 
passed to the effect that only one 
member of each group may be 
represented in the voting room 
and no loiterers will be permitted 
near the polls. It was also agreed 
that candidates will not be allow
ed to clutter up the bulletin boards 
with publicity notices.

Finalfor telephones
THIS electrical moutli at Bell Telephone Laboratories is 
putting a new telephone to. one of its final tests. Over 
and over, it can repeat these odd sentences without tlie slight
est variation. They contain all the fundamental sounds that con
tribute to the loudness of sound in our speech. This mouth can 
also make tests with simple tones of known pitch and intensity.
At the same time other telephones are being steamed, baked, 
frozen, lifted and dropped into their cradles by tireless ma
chines. All this is part of a carefully planned curriculum 
that makes every piece of telephone equip

possible serviceunder any and all conditions.

Itec omsurnCA
People are always talking about how birthdays make you 
feel older; it!s midsemesters that do that to us. Midsemesters,, 
like nothing else, mark cruelly the swift passage of time. Birth
days, you know about. You know what date they are, and what 
season they are, and youre prepared for them as far as a month 
in advance. But nobody ever knows the date of midsemesters 
everyone loses the little book they give you at registration 
and no sooner has the term started and youve begun to get back 
in your work again, than they creep up 011 you, upsetting plans 
for seeing tliat movie thats finally come to the neighborhood the
atre.
For Posterity
There was a piece in the paper giving some statistics com
piled by a laundry company about the number of banquet cloths
that have to be discarded because people draw pictures all over
......... them. The Beanery has solved this problem
very nicety, if perhaps unconsciously, by pro
viding the student bodys with those nice white 
tabletops. Tliey take ink as well as pencil, and 
theres a sort of pioneer feeling you get from 
working on them, like Abraham Lincoln doing 
math problems 011 the back of a shovel. The 
only difficulty, of course, is that, like love-letters 
in the sand, you cant take them with you. 
Youve got to accept having them obliterated 
by the bus-boy and his damp rag, 01* you must 
spend the rest of your life in the Beanery, watching them.
A lot of people^specialty engineersseem to lose sight of 
this. They do all their problems on the top of a Beanery table 
or on the top of three or four Beanery tablesand then find that 
its time to go to class. We forgot, once. We drew a portarit 
of a very nice boy we knew, and had to leave it to go to the mov
ies. The boy graduated soon after that, and has since joined the 
Army. We expect never to see him again, and now we cant re
member what he looks like. And besides, it was the only picture 
we ever drew that looked like the thing we were drawing.
Censorship
It looks as though. Citizen Kane, the Orson Welles production 
that advance reviewers have called one of the finest pictures ever 
made, is never going to get farther tlian the preview stage. Willy 
Hearst, that old castle-colleetor, has decided that its too much 
like his life, and has gone about having it stoppedin the high
handed way that seems to be characteristic .of the man who 
takes (dr took) personal credit' for .starting the Spanish-American War. We think this rather silly of Mr. Hearst. He seems 
to us to be acting like the conscience-stricken little girl who, left 
alone for the afternoon, called up her mother and said, Honest 
mother, I havent been teasing the cat. Honest! Probably 95% 
of the literate population of this country knows what Citizen 
Kane is about. The fact that Mr. Hearst is being so sensitive is 
practically an admission that Citizen Kane is Mr. Hearst. Hes an 
old man, and he cant do too much more harm. We dont care 
much what his personal life has been like now, but wed like to 
see the first picture that the talented Mr. W.elles has made, and 
were mad at Willy Hearst for keeping it from us.
Even if you dont like Aldous Huxley (we do) -we advise you 
to read After Many a Summer Dies the Swan. Just for spite.
Careless
We.ve lost our fountain pen again. This happens periodical
ly, and we cant figure out why. Weve had our name put on 
them; weve clipped them to our pockets and hung them with 
ribbons around our neck. No matter how closely we stick to 
those fountain pens though, after a certain amount of time 
(usually about two weeks) they try out their wings and fly 
away. Maybe they get married and set up housekeeping for 
themselves. We dont know.
Eventually, weve always got to buy another one. But we 
like to hold off for a couple of weeks, subconsciously hoping that 
the pen will come homepenitent. In the meantime, we have 
nothing with which to write, so we steal pencils from our soft
hearted classmate. Weve worked out a schedulewhen we 
lose seven pencils, we buy a new pen.

Doomed?
Are Tecli Freslimen 
Like Machines ?
By Robert Taber
There is no such thing as a 
perpetually self-motivated body. 
Not even the freshman bodythe 
force of the freshman's energyis 
dissipated by repetitions of his 
daily-weekly routine.
Lets see how this constant fric
tion creates a drag, a gradual 
running-down of this human ma
chine.
An enterprising high school 
senior, looking ahead to the at
tainment of his high ambitions, 
applies for entrance to Carnegie 
Tech. During the summer he receives a letter from the Regis
trar telling him that he has been 
accepted to enroll in the coming 
September. Immediately everyone 
he meets congratulates him upon 
his success and gives him some 
words of encouragement concern
ing how lucky he is to be able to 
further his education and there
by attain his ideal.
September comes and he enrolls 
here at Tech. Fraternity rushing, 
orientation plans, registration, and 
placement tests take up most of 
his time, and finally classes start. 
For the first few weeks he dili
gently pursues his education and, 
like a book-worm, he goes to all 
lectures and classes on time. Fin
ally the novelty of college life 
wears off and slowly it becomes 
a grind. He becomes lax and goes 
to movies, dances, or dorm par
ties to fulfill that something with
in him that demands novelty. Af
ter a while even this becomes 
matter-of-fact.
Cold weather comes and he
Pitt, Tech IFCs

Representatives from the Pitt 
and Tech Interfraternity Councils 
are planning to meet soon to dis
cuss plans for sports and social 
activities between the two groups. 
By these activities it is hoped that 
the members will become better 
acquainted and that closer rela
tions may be formed between the 
two councils. Carnegies represen
tatives are Dr. Neelley, Ralph 
Martin, 41, Bob Webb, 42, Frank 
Hesch, 41, and Riley Fowler, 41.

for incoming fr-eshmen next year.
turns to snowball fights and ce 
skating to supply his want for 
something different. Here is 
v/here his high ambitions take a 
back seat. His childishness, which 
has been subjugated since his 
graduation from high school 
springs to life. He builds snow 
barricades, breaks windows in the 
dorms with snowballs, and low
ers his mien to that of a high 
school sophomore. Then spring 
comes and his ideals are com
pletely forgotten.
He no longer studies, is late for 
many classes and cuts the rest 
of them. He looks forward to the 
coming fall term as an oppor
tunity to start again and not re
peat the errors of the first year.
September comes,/and the new 
sophomore enters school with 
fresh hope, not knowing that he 
is doomed to' enter again on the 
lagging cycle.

A. C. S. Accredits 
Chemistry Course 
At Carnegie Tech
Our Department of Chemistry 
has recently been honored by be
ing included among those schools 
accredited by the -American 
Chemical Society. This represents 
the first attempt made by any or
ganization to evaluate chemistry 
courses in American colleges and 
universities. The list includes 
ninety-two schools throughout 
the United States, Tech and Al
legheny being the only schools in 
this district to receive the distinc
tion.
The accrediting itself was very 
comprehensive, taking two years 
to complete. The final selection 
was based on questionnaires sub
mitted to the various schools, the 
quality of the faculty, the cur
riculum, and the equipment and 
floor space available. The investi
gation Was terminated by a per
sonal visit of two members of the 
society.
The accrediting of the depart
ment will automatically permit a 
graduate to become a member of 
the society upon completing two 
years of practical work or grad
uate work. Otherwise a much 
longer period is required after 
graduation.
The American Chemical Society 
has also accredited the Chemical 
Engineering Departments of all 
schools which were accredited by 
the American Institute of Chem
ical Engineers. This includes 
Techs department, which, in fact, 
has been on the accredited list 
since its founding.

Speaking last week in New 
York at the Overseas Press Club, 
Commander Edward Ellsberg, U. 
S. N. R., states that he was sure 
he spoke the mind of the Admin
istration when he said We are in 
the war now. He reasoned as 
follows: Since the U. S. demand
ed indemnity from Britain after 
the Civil War for damage done by 
British raiders flying the flag of 
the Confederacy (Alabama 
Claims), Germany now has a 
legitimate claim against the U. S. 
for the damage being done to 
Germnn shipping by tho fifty 
destroyers transferred to Britain 
last September.
He then pointed to the fact 
that Britain is faced with in
tensive submarine warfare and 
claimed that the only way 
for us to help Is to convoy 
supplies at once. I have spoken 
to the Government, he went on, 
"and I know that wo will be do
ing this before long. Wo do not 
have to declare war now any more 
than we did when we shelled Vera 
Cruz in 1014. At that time the 
Navy had orders to accomplish an 
objective. It dicl so even though 
it meant killing some Mexicans. 
Home Charity Suffers
Private charities and community 
chests have suffered severely from 
the campaign for "Bundles for 
Britain. Important sources of 
funds have been cut off. Com
fortably fixed, elderly ladies who 
used to volunteer their services to
1......oq 'u,vifies, and who used
to the American 
only to Britain.
 ised to give hardiu save ijcinnw, to municipal milk 
funds now go to a British benefit, 
meet Lady this or that, contribute 
a dollar, go home with the hap
py memory of having conversed 
with nobility.
While there can be no hon
est objection to contributions 
for the relief of the hungry 
and cold anywhere in the world, 
there is irony in the fact 
that our own destitute are the 
losers. Moreover, the British need 
very little of this sort of charity. 
While free, hand-knitted sweaters 
go to Britain, occupy cargo space 
needed for munitions, Britain 
ships an increasing volume of 
knitted goods to this country to 
raise foreign exchange. (Accord
ing to one unconfirmed rumor 
goods donated to Britain are pil
ing up in warehousesmuch as 
they did during the World War.) 
The most useless gifts of all are 
said to be ambulanceswhich the 
British simply do not need. Mur
murs from Britain about too many 
unnecessary donations have been 
discreetly stifled; the propaganda 
value is too great.
8. All members of Tau Beta Pi, 
who are elected as juniors, 
shall receive 8 points. Actives 
of Theta Tau and Scarab 
elected in Sophomore year 
shall receive 8 points

Running a school the size of 
Carnegie involves more than just 
lectures, holding examinations, 
and handing out grades. The.-controlling and policy-determining 
machinery of Carnegie Institute 
of Technology requires almost as 
complicated a series of arrange
ments as a modern corporation, or 
holding company.
To trace the course of this ma
chinery, we must first go back to 
the Board of Trustees of the Car
negie Institute of Technology, 
which has supreme control over 
all of the schools and endowments. 
This board appoints an executive 
committee, which decides general 
policies. President Doherty is a 
member of this committee and the 
Board of Trustees.
President Doherty acts through 
the local Executive Board of 
which he is chairman and the Ed
ucational Senate. This Executive 
Board acts through the following 
committees: Annual Exhibition,
Calendar and Schedules, Fees and 
Charges, Historical Records, Pub
lications, Public Occasions, Radio 
Broadcasts, Rules and Regulations 
and Safety. All are made up of 
faculty members solely, except the 
newly formed Rules and Regula
tions Committee which has stu
dent representation. The faculty 
members of the various commit
tees are appointed each year by 
President Doherty.
The Education Senate consists 
of permanent administrative 
members, faculty members, elect
ed for one year, and standing 
committees. The latter include: 
Undergraduate Admission Re
quirements, Undergraduate Cur
ricula, Undergraduate Degrees, 
Examination and Marking Sys
tem, and Military Affairs Com
mittees. The name of each comittee signifies, in a fairly ade
quate manner, its function.
Each college has its own direc
tor and e^ch department of a col
lege its own head. In addition to 
the colleges, there is a Division of 
Student Personnel and Welfare, 
Physical Welfare, and Evening,
Summer, and Part-time Courses. 
The research laboratories, the R. 
O. T. C., and the Controllers 
Offices also have separate clas
sifications. To unify the work of 
the various colleges, divisions, 
and departments, there are six 
committees. These include the 
Social Relations Program, Auxil
iary Enterprises and Concessions, 
Library, Athletic Board, Space, 
and Power Plant. The Athletic 
Board is made up of three trus
tees, three faculty members, three 
alumni, the editor of the TARTAN 
the president of Student Council, 
a member of the football team, 
and three ex-officio members of 
the administration. The Space 
Committee allots offices and rooms 
to the various departments. The 
Committee of the Administration 
reports directly to President Do
herty.
The faculty are also organized 
into a general faculty committee 
of which Professor W. L. McCabe 
is chairman. Subcommittees in
clude: Welfare, Flowers, House, 
and Conference.
Although the functions of these 
bodies have been sharply defined, 
there is a frequent interlapping of 
the duties of one with the other. 
For example, if a man desires to 
become a faculty member, he must 
be recommended by the depart
ment head to the director of the 
particular college. The director 
forwards the recommendation af
ter due consideration to the pres
ident who in turn most obtain the 
approval of the Board of Trustees.
The above classification does 
not become sufficiently detailed to 
include allthe minor positions 
and committees held under the 
various departments and divisions. 
This would necessitate the inser
tion of the batteries of secretar
ies, copyists, assistants, etc., which 
are needed to round out the func
tions of the departments and 
boards.
In spite of this overwhelming 
complexity, the Carnegie Institute 
of Technology machine seems to 
function smoothly, turning out 
scores of trained young men and 
women.

Finish Season; 
Swimming Next
By Bob Cowie
This coming Thursday, under 
the bright lights in the Carnegie 
Tech Gymnasium, the playolT 
game of the current Intramural 
Basketball season will decide the 
new school champion. And this 
will be a good basketball game, 
for both contesting teams, each 
having completed an undefeated 
season, are priming themselves for 
the coming tilt. Exceptionally re
markable will be the caliber of the 
men, each team possessing some 
very fine artists in the basketball 
field. As winners of the Interfra
ternity League the S. A. E.s, fea
turing Mahaffey, McClung, Miller, 
Blenko, Klein and Munyer, will 
match their collective ability 
against Loveday, Needham, Mc
Clure, McDonald, White, and 
Heights of the Citcom Clan, top 
team in the Independent League. 
Blenko and McClung, high scor
ing threats of the S. A. E.s will 
be vieing for top scores against 
small-but-clever Paul Loveday 
and over-stretched McClure. In
tense excitement has already been 
exhibited over the coming match 
and there will be a fine crowd 
present to watch this game of the 
season.
As winner of the Volleyball 
championship in the Intramural 
program, the PiKA team has been 
competing in the city against some 
very fine teams, and has been fair
ly successful. The club was able 
to come out victorious over two 
different teams representing the 
Pittsburgh Athletic Association, 
and lost one match to the Young 
Men's Hebrew Association. Such 
a record is commendable.
With the coming of spring and 
subsequently a new group of 
sports, many of those events that 
have been running in the past aro

weeks a number of fellows have

22 Recruits Out 
For Golf Squad, 
Practice in Gym
With last seasons entire varsity 
back and with 16 new recruits 
challenging them for a position on 
the first string, prospects for a 
successful links season for the 
Tartan golfers are very bright.
Last years veterans are Cap-- 
tain Jack Ellen, George Tondorf, 
Paul Loveday, A1 Gubey, Harry 
Sacks, and John Shymowsky. 
These men will find stiff compe
tition in defending their berths 
against such contenders as Charley 
Klimus, tall varsity man of two 
seasons ago who was ineligible 
last year, Red Burch, hardwod 
star, Ward Duchene, top man from, 
the Freshman squad of last sea-, 
son, and many others.
The golfers have been getting 
in some advance practice in the 
driving range in tho gym, and 
have been receiving professional 
Instruction from Bill Kane who 
has been hired to iron out the 
kinks before the weather allow, 
the boys to got out-of-doors for 
some real practice.
Negotiations are under way for 
the Tech squad to obtain use of 
the Field Club, their home course/ 
on every Tuesday and Thursday 
for practice rounds. If II. is found 
impossible for the Sldbos to warm 
up on the Field Club links, they 
will probably use tho Shadyside 
Academy course, home grounds of 
the Tech Freshman squad.
Let'LsgoOWN
INTRAMURAL RULING
Eyman and Company
Last season about this same 
time the Intramural Board put a 
new rule on their books. This bit 
of legislation stated that any per
son desiring to swim for any or
ganization in the intramural 
swimming competition must prac
tice at least six hours before the 
beginning of the contests. This 
ruling was enforced to such an 
extent that only two organizations 
had enough men qualified to com
pete in this event.
Despite the lesson that should 
have been learned from last years 
poor performance, the intramural 
board again adopted this same 
idea and propose to make it ap
ply to this years participants.
The reason given Dy those per
sons who are the sponsors of this 
plan is that a person should be in 
sound physical condition if he is to 
enter such an event. Undoubted
ly this is true however, when we 
stop to think we realize that the 
entrants for every other intra
mural sporting event are dis
missed with a hurried physical ex
amination. Such examinations be
ing the only ticket a man needs 
io enjoy himself by entering an 
intramural competition.
It appears to me, that such rule 
defeats the basic idea of the en
tire intramural programwhich 
has been more students entering 
interclass and inter-squad ath
letics. However, Mr. Eyman and 
his student board seem to be de
termined to see their brain child 
enforced and refuse to back down 
on a ruling once put on the rec
ord. Therefore, since the actual 
swimming competition starts next 
Monday, the only course open to 
those who wish to swim is take 
some of their time and spend it 
in the Carnegie pool splashing 
around with the rest of their class. 
CARNEGIE FORM NEW 
Tech Swimmers
Last Saturday evening in the 
Carnegie pool, the first annual 
meet of the Penn-Ohio Swimming 
Association was held. At the pres
ent time this league is composed 
of the following schools: Carnegie 
Tech, Slippery Rock, W&J, Alle
gheny, Kent State Teachers Col
lege, Westminster, and Bethany. 
The idea of the league can be 
credited to Allen E. Risedorph,
coach of the Carnegie swimming 
squad. Mr. Risedorph states that 
the purpose of the organization is 
to hold an annual competition be
tween schools who sponsor swim
ming teams that are consistently 
mediocre as compared to the out
standing collegiate teams of the 
country.
In the first meet of this league, 
Slippery Rock State Teachers 
College went home sporting first 
honors while the Plaidmen of 
Carnegie finished in the second 
position.
A big bowl of blooming orchids 
should be dumped in Marse Risedorphs lap for instigating such a 
league, for such an intercollegi
ate organization has been long 
needed in this section of the coun
try. Such a league for other Tar
tan sportsmen is something that 
should be seriously considered by 
the sporting dignitaries' of other 
school collegiate sports programs.
The lead, at the present time, in 
the total number of points amass
ed for the intramural point trophy 
is held by the happy men of old 
Delta Tau. The DTDs have the 
grand total of 543 points while 
the next spot is held by the DUs 
who have run up 487 points. The 
other organizations whose names 
appear high up on the list are: 
Tau Delta Phi, Cictom Clan, and 
Pi Kappa Alpha.
Last year thi^ coveted cup was 
won by the PiKAs; this organi
zation in order to stage a repeat 
performance, must show a terrific 
spurt if they are to catch the fastmoving Delts.
Basketball Final
Next Thursday the final contest 
between the Citcomers and the 
SAEs will be staged in the Car
negie gym. This battle, which has 
all the ear-marks of being an ex
citing contest, is open to any stu
dent of young Skibo who appears 
before, after, or exactly at 8:30, 
the designated hour of the contest.
NOTICE
Anyone who is interested in 
taking the Junior or Senior Am
erican Red Cross Life Saving 
Tests should see Bob Dominy in 
he swimming pool at the gym by 
4:30 Wednesday afternoon.

W. A. A. NEWS
-------------By BETTY PARKER-------------
One bit of good news is follow
ed by more, in the line of confer
ences. With Penn State week-end 
on our list, we now have an in
vitation from the W. A. A. of State 
Teachers College of California, 
Pa. A Home Defense play day 
on Saturday, March 22, sounds 
interesting and basket-ball, rifle, 
volleyball, table tennis, and bad
minton are among the activities. 
We know we will be sending our 
eight recruits from Tech for that 
day, and well let you know all 
about it later.
Tech gals had better take over 
all the teams. Last week the bad
minton club defeated Duquesnes 
team, and it was a good match.
Basketballers have yet to meet the 
Dukes on the gym floor, but that 
event is on the way. From the en
thusiasm on the part of the home 
team and visiting team, we real
ize we must have more and more 
intercollegiate competitions. Fun, 
exciting, good sport, and a way 
to meet the girls from other camp
uses. Come on you lazy people, 
support your own teams!
W. A. A. is considering the 
building of a tennis court. Does 
that interest you tennisers? More 
about that later when plans are 
more definite, but meanwhile, if 
we see enougii interest in the 
spring tennis, the board may de
cide it is well-worth while to have 
another womens court.

Carnegie Finishes 
In Second Position, 
Molvie Paces Team
Winning six of nine events and 
placing second or third in most 
others, Slippery Rocks power
house swimming team last Satur
day won the first championship 
of the newly formed Penn-Ohio 
Swimming Association. With 73 
points to their credit, the Rock
ets were trailed by Tech with 52, 
W. & J. with 27, Westminster with 
8, and Allegheny, whose line en
try earned two points for fourth 
place in the 50 yard freestyle. 
Although the final score seems 
somewhat one-sided, in many of 
the races there was only a mat
ter of inches between the first and 
last man. Individual honors were 
shared by Captain Molvie of Car
negie, winner of the 50 yard sprint 
and second in the 100 yard free
style, and Reardon of Slippery 
Rock, victor in both the 200 and 
100 yard freestyle events.
The first event, the 300 yard 
medley, was won by the Rockets 
in a good 3:23.2, followed by 
Westminster and Carnegie. Cap
tain Molvie easily won the next 
race, the 50, in :25.7, with a com
fortable lead over Pritchard of 
Slippery Rock and Meyers of W. 
W 'r Best performance of the 
Rockets was in the 220, in which 
they were able to take first, second 
and third places. Sophomore Bill 
Brown, of Tech, came through in 
fine style to win the fancy diving 
with 91 points. Reardon, with a 
very fast :58.8 beat the field in 
the 100, and his teammate Grant, 
followed with a victory in the 
backstroke, touching out Martin 
of Tech. Senecal, also of the 
Rockets, won the breaststroke, 
with Carnegies Vajda close be
hind. Hamel of Westminster won 
the 440, trailed by Boehmig of
dPM gTTR 242UCP
At the termination of the 1940- 
41 basketball season, the Skibo 
hoopsters assembled and elected 
Henry Hank Holets captain of 
the squad for the 1941-42 cam
paign. Hank, as he is best known 
by all his friends, entered Tech in 
1938, coming from Ambridge 
High School. While in high school 
Holets played both football and 
basketball under the tutilage of 
Moe Rubenstein and was one of 
the most versatile athletes de
veloped in that section. Since he 
has been at Tech, Hank has con
tinued his versatile role, playing 
center on both the football and 
basketball teams during his jun
ior year. He has also developed a 
great friendship during the past 
season for Dr. Sykes Reed.
Hank was elected to replace 
Red Burch who will be lost to the 
team next year due to graduation, 
and it is hoped that he will lead 
the team to a victory next year. 
He is undoubtedly the coolest man 
on either Tech team and never 
seems to be bothered, not even 
when he dropped the ball in the 
West Virginia teams basket at the 
start of the season.
This past season was the worst 
in Carnegie basketball history, the 
team losing eighteen straight 
games to set a new school record, 
battering the old one of sixteen 
in a row made while John Irwin 
was the coach.

The loss of ore game by the 
Delts, and the winning of three by 
the PiKAs and Betas leveled oil 
the first three places in league A 
to a single position. The Delts 
won two games and lost one all 
important tilt in their match with 
the Beta Sigs. The PiKAs white
washed the ATOs by taking all 
three points. The Betas also 
spilled enough maples to score 
three games, much to the dislike 
of the Sigma Nus, the losers. So 
at the present time the first three 
places of last week are now one, 
with the PiKAs, Betas and Delts 
all squeezed into the number one 
position. Each of these teams have 
vvon fifteen and lost three.
The Citcom Clan holds the top 
rank in league B by a wide mar
gin, and the scores indicate that 
there are no teams close enough 
to place the Clans position in 
danger. By all past performances 
this team should take their league.
Tech. In the final 400 yard relay, 
the Rockets again came through, 
and again were followed by Tech 
and Westminster. At the end of 
the meet Manager Martin was 
dunked, clothes and all.

Is a good point of discussion in 
planning other social events, as 
an evening as enjoyable as this 
proved to be, should be made 
longer.
Our thanks are extended to the 
chaperons who attended, and the 
students appreciate the effort put 
forth by the following officers in 
charge of this affair: Fred Fargotstein, President, John DeLuca, 
Vice-President, Lou Fosner, Sec
retary, Bob Metcalf, Treasurer, 
and Harold Geilman, Social Chair
man.

Student Council 
Selects Industries 
Man for Office
The students of the Evening 
College of Industries have elected 
Frank A. Carlos to represent them 
on the Evening Student Council as 
treasurer of their group. He must 
have fulfilled that capacity well, 
for several months later he was 
elected as treasurer of Student 
Council.
Being born and raised in the 
Pittoclc vicinity, Frank attended 
Stowe High School where he fol
lowed the academic course of 
studies. His favorite subjects were 
the sciences and he was also a 
member of their Glee Club. He 
was graduated in 1934.
Frank started to spend his 
evenings at Tech in February, 
1936. He started his schooling as 
an Engineer but soon changed to 
the structural drafting course of 
the College of Industries. He re
ceived his certificate from that de
partment in the summer df 1940 
but is still furthering his studies. 
His daytime hours are spent at the 
Pittsburgh Des-Moines Steel Com
pany where he is employed as an 
inspector in the lay-out division. 
He has been employed at this 
work for the past five years.
For diversion Frank likes to 
drive his car, bowl, and enjoys 
many spectator sports. He is not 
very particular when referring to 
his women, but brunettes are held 
in his preference. By the way, his 
draft number is 1269, but he 
doesnt expect to get called for 
a while. He likes lo dance to both 
sweet and swing music and he 
dances well to both.
Although this is his first year 
as a member of the Evening Stu
dent Council, Frank was a very 
active worker last year and re
ceived his insignia award for par
ticipation in extra-curricular ac
tivities. He was called to the Nu 
Sigma Alpha Activities Honorary 
Fraternity last summer.

Your BolSar Buys More 
At Techs Bargain Basement
If I should ask any one of you 
how much you could buy for $1.00 
what would you say? Perhaps a 
book, tie, meal, stockings, shirt or 
any of a multitude of things which 
can be bought for a dollar. Few 
of us place any great importance 
on the value of a dollar or what 
it brings us. A dollar represents 
a very small amount of our total 
purchasing power. If someone of
fered you three or four dollars 
for each one you possessed, you 
would think he was either out of 
his mind, or had more money than 
he knew what to do with. The 
Evening Student Council is doing 
that here at Tech, however, and
I can vouch for their sanity. In 
case you still doubt me, let me 
explain.
Each student pays $1.00 a year 
as an activity fee. In return for 
that dollar he gets the following 
items:
.A one year subscription to the 
paper which costs $1.00 without 
mailing charge (note editorial 
page), a handbook which costs 
about 25c per student, making a 
total of $1.25 for every student.
If he is a member of the Col
lege of Fine Arts or Industries, he 
is permitted to attend three free 
dances which represent an expen
diture of $3.00. If he is an En
gineer he gets two free dances 
which represent an expenditure 
of $2.00. This makes a return of 
$4.25 for students in Arts and In
dustries and $3.25 for the En^ 
gineering students for your in
itial $1.00.
Then if you are a good council 
worker, you receive free admis
sion to a picnic held in the sum
mer, and are one of councils 
guests at the Insignia Dinner. At 
this dinner keys ranging from one 
to three dollars are given those 
having sufficient points, and three 
scholarships having a cash value 
of $90.00 are awarded.
In addition to all this; Council 
pays the salaries of its adminis
trative officers and usually makes 
a yearly contribution to the en
dowment fund.
So there my friends you have 
what is probably the worlds 
greatest value, all yours for just 
a single dollar.
We Americans are willing and 
able to do all in our power of 
might and purse to aid in the sub
jection of Europes current Grab
bers, even to the extent of risk
ing of being involved in war. 
However, it might be to a stu
dents advantage to petition Con
gress to divert some of its ready 
money to the cause of ridding the 
campus of the vermin who infest 
the building, lurking like birds of 
prey, waiting for some person to 
turn his back on his valuables so 
that this vulture might pounce 
upon said valuables and carry 
them away. Must a person hire a 
bodyguard or a detective to safe
guard his possessions in the halls 
of our august institution, or might 
it be in the power of the authori
ties to make a test case of one
of these incidents? Such affairs 
are not beneficial to any institu
tion, especially one of the caliber 
of Tech.
MARTHA E. GEHRETT.
Editors note: We heartily agree 
with Miss Gehrett and her opin
ion of those pleasant people who 
seem to suffer from stickosis, 
better known as sticky fingers. 
We can only add that we, too, 
would like to see them apprehend
ed. If anyone notices any of these 
low-class animals slinking about 
the halls, he should immediately 
track him to his lair, or notify the 
proper authorities. There are 
plenty of watchmen on the camp
us, and all you need do is notify 
one of them. By doing this, you 
will help the school stamp out 
these unfair practices.
An important meeting of the So
cial Committee of the Evening 
College of Engineering will be 
held in the Student Conference 
Room of the Carnegie Union next 
Friday, March 21, beginning at 
10:30 p. m. All members of the 
committee are urged to be pres
ent. More plans will be laid for 
the Engineers Banquet to be held 
May 3, in the Sclienley Hotel.

Phi Nu fraternity men and their 
friends enjoyed themselves last 
Saturday night at a Stag Party 
held at the Community House in 
South Park.
A1 Lois, an old-timer on the 
evening campus, wrote the theme 
for the evening: an Irish Boogie 
Woogie. A Boogie Woogie (a la 
Phi Nu) is just an excuse to get 
away from the gal friend for an 
evening with the boys.

Glittering like the snow on a 
moonlit night was the diamond 
ring we saw at the last dance; 
Stanley Stolarczyk, Vice Presi
dent of Industries, placed it on 
Helens finger. Congratulations; 
we knew Spring was on the way.
Another well known active Inrustries student who took a step 
in that non-returnable one-way 
direction was Allen Grandey when 
he decorated Virginia Lores fing
er with a diamond.
If ever youve seen our Edi
tor Ed Nuss at the dances, youd 
soon realize that he doesnt be

Weve searched high and low

Joe Gummo, our Social Chair
man, recently vacationed in Flor

for the Army late this month. He 
still hopes hell be shipped to 
Hawaii. Wed rather go to the 
South Sea Islands.
The President of Engineering 
College, David Pettigrew, took 
time out to celebrate his becom
ing a man. He was twenty-one 
years old on Saturday. Thats a lot 
of burden for so young a man. 
Wonder if his heavy worries were 
the cause of his sprained ankle at 
the Engineers Dance.

Editors Apologize 
For Dance Error
The Plaid Editors wish to cor
rect a mistake made in last weeks 
issue of the paper. Under the cap
tion Dance Change, the new 
date listed for the Nu Sigma Al
pha Dance was April sixth. That 
date should be April twenty-sixth.

George What-a-Man Pripetons.
Bob McFeaters seems to be 
burning up the road quite a bit 
between East Liberty and Finleyville. Is she blonde or brun
ette? And Spring is still around 
the corner.
Bob Denham seems to do quite 
well by himself, judging by the 
bevy of beauties he brings to the 
dances.
Last but not least, the annual 
Nu Sigma Alpha Fraternity Smok
er will be held on March twentyninth in Etna.

That according to the Statistical Abstract of the United 
States for 1939 Pittsburgh has a total of only 87 clear days each 
year. There are four cities listed with less than this, however. 
They are Green Bay, Wisconsin, 84-; Seattle, Washington, 79; Buf
falo, New York, 74-; and Northfield, Vermont, 66. The last four 
are located near large bodies of water with their resultant banks 
of fog, which cause the low average of clear days. In Pittsburgh, 
however, we blame it on smog. By way of comparison we could 
say that Phoenix, Arizona has the largest number of clear days 
236. In Pittsburgh we get only 50% of the total sunshine, while in 
Northfield, Vermont; Seattle, Washington; Parkersburg, West 
Virginia; and Portland, Oregon, the people absorb 48%, 47%, 46% 
and 45% respectively. In this case, Helena, Montana, receives the 
greatest percentage 87%.
That in the United States in 1930 there were a total of 801,901 
machinists, five of which were members of the fairer sex. As we 
go into this great defense program we have at our disposal about 
640,285 machinists, four of which are members of the fairer sex. 
No wonder there is a bottleneck in the defense program, weve 
lost one of the women.
That in 1900 there were registered in the various colleges, 
universities and professional schools only 167,999 students as com
pared to 1,062,760 students registered in the same schools in 1936 
no bottleneck here.
