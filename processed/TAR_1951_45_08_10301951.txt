This year the Campus Chest drive will run from October 29 
through November 4, with a combined student-faculty goal of $7000. 
The purpose of the campaign is the unification in one drive of the 
solicitations of those organizations which previously conducted individual drives. ?

Red Cross 6$
Salvation Army 5%
World Student Service
Fund 11%
Cancer Fund 10%
Infantile Paralysis Fund 16%
Heart Fund 7%

ganizations serving Allegheny 
County. These include organiza-J Cf ,1 l.T
tions devoted to child welfare, , J. aLUll\
fessors in 19 countries through 
this fund. The WSSF uses its 
funds to provide books and other 
supplies, to help reduce the alarm
ing TB rate, and to sponsor selfhelp programs among the stu
dents.
The work of the Red Cross, the 
Salvation Army, the National 
Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, 
the American Cancer Society, and 
the Heart Fund should be familiar 
to nearly all of the students.
Five Seniors Form
organizations such as the Boy 
Scouts which are interested in the 
youth of the community, organi
zations which assist the handi
capped and the aged, hospitals, 
and other agencies which promote 
community health, and other 
groups giving general community 
service.

The World Student Service 
Fund is an international studentto-student aid program. Students 
and professors in the war-devastated countries in Europe and 
Southeast Asia will receive aid 
from fellow students and proPep Rally!
The Lehigh pep rallymost 
important of the yearwill be 
held Friday night, November 
9, at 7:30 in the Tech Bowl. 
The rally is sponsored by Stu
dent Council in cooperation 
with Scimitars and Mortar 
Board. Lets all get behind 
that beat Lehigh!
Liaison Committee
UAC, the Undergraduate Advis
ory Committee, has laid the 
groundwork for operations in the 
current school year. Consisting at 
present of five senior members 
Tom Astle, Lloyd Dyer, Wally 
Neilson, Joe Pecenka, and Don 
Schumacherthe group acts as an 
informal liaison between students 
and the administration.
Formed several years ago when 
the need for student-administration contact became increasingly 
apparent, the organization has 
been one of the most effective 
means of solving difficult student 
problems on which the adminis
tration has little or no informa
tion. Members are chosen by the 
preceding group, or are added 
duringthe school year by the 
present members.
At present, the current group is 
working on pep rallies, Skibo 
conditions, improved Carnegie 
Day and Frosh-Soph Competition 
for Homecoming, student vandal
ism, and the muddle of conflict
ing authority on dance planning 
and procedure.
PLANNING "Y" RETREAT
Burt Sauvageot and Kitty Ditty, respective presidents of the 
campus chapters of. the YMCA and YWCA, are shown as they plan 
for their organizations joint annual fall retreat. The retreat, sched
uled for this coming weekend, will be held in Oglebay Park near 
Wheeling. All are inviteddetails can be secured from Mr. Rollin 
Davis, campus Y sponsor, at the Carnegie Union. The cost of 
the weekend is $6.00 per per sou.
Re-Election
Re-elections for freshman 
president will be held next 
Wednesday, October 31, fea
turing the same candidates as 
the previous elections. The 
ballot boxes will be placed in 
the same places: Administra
tion Hall, the Fine Arts Build
ing, MMCC, and Skibo. The 
polls will be open from 11:30 
a.m. to 1:30 p.m.
30 Percent of Class 
Twice Fail to Appear
According to Scimitar and Cwens, sophomore honoraries in 
charge of freshman regulations on the Carnegie campus, only 62 
percent of the present freshman class succeeded in passing the CIT 
traditions exams given shortly before Homecoming.

Freshman Failure
The highly touted freshman class has fallen flat on its 
face, both in electing class officers and in the traditions exam. 
But while the class of 1955 cannot be excused entirely, enough 
stumbling blocks were thrown in the path by other groups 
to make the outcome almost a certainty.
Only 14 freshmen filed petitions for officesix of these 
were for president and another five were for vice president 
from E&S. There are no candidates at all for the offices of 
secretary and treasurer. Yet even with this meager response 
the first election had to be cancelled because some self-styled 
Huey Longs decided to vote more than once.
Disregarding: the two or three who voted twice, we believe that 
there is enough interest in the class to support a good election 
campaignprovided that this interest is fanned, gently but 
firmly. Student Council has taken the attitude that scheduling * 
the election is enough, that freshman interest can take care of it
self. This attitude, however, overlooks the fact that the fresh
men have no knowledge of the duties and importance of class 
officers except what they are told. If Council had put on an 
effective publicity campaign concerning class elections we feel 
there would have been at least two to three times the response 
that actually occurred. The negative attitude of Council toward 
class elections, especially toward freshmen who need some form 
of indoctrination, is largely responsible for the poor showing and 
has consequently weakened class organization as a whole.
The second charge against the freshmen is more serious. 
Of approximately 583 eligible to take the traditions exam, 42 
flunked the test and 163 didnt take it at all, though it was 
given on two separate dates. Sophomore organizations, real
izing that knowledge of the school and its traditions can be 
a rallying point for school spirit, have worked long and 
hard to make the traditions exam a success. But the fresh
men, learning from upperclassmen that there could be a 
powder-puff enforcement of any regulations concerning the 
freshmen, disregarded the exam as quickly as they tossed 
away their dinks.
Everyone cries about school spirit, but no one seems will
ing to put teeth into measures such as the traditions exam, 
which are a first approach to the problem. Elsewhere on 
this page the cheerleaders attribute part of the lack of stu
dent enthusiasm to the fact that many dont know the cheers 
things everyone should have learned by taking the tradi
tions exam.
At present Sophomores have no power at all .to enforce 
rules concerning th traditions exam. They can only send polite 
letters to campus organizations requesting that anyone flunking 
the exam be made ineligible for extracurricular activities, but its 
doubtful if Dr. Baker will take any action against the two or 
three freshman footballers who are among those who didnt 
bother with the exam.
The administration, which could enforce the traditions 
exam, takes the attitude that some sort of idealistic student 
enforcement is sufficient, and that well, anyway, those who 
took the exam got something out of it and those who didnt 
wouldnt have learned anything had they taken it. This lat
ter attitude is equivalent to saying that only those who want 
to should have to attend high school. What is needed is some 
sort of positive policy such as the following:
(1) All freshmen be required to take the exam.
(2) Those who fail the exam be barred from all extra
curricular activities until they prove their knowledge 
of Carnegie traditions to the satisfaction of some group 
of responsible students.
<3) Fraternity initiation should depend on passing the exam.
<4) The intramural office should cooperate by forfeiting to 
the opposing team any game in which a freshman who 
has not passed the exam has participated.
(5) Activity heads should be made personally accountable 
for all freshman members in their organizations.
A lot of work is involved in this program, but Scimitar 
has demonstrated its willingness to do the job. Those who 
ask what r^n we do improve school spirit can find a real 
opportunity in the enforcement of the freshman traditions 
exam.

Notre Dame, 
Carnegie 
Relations Good
This week the following letter 
was received from Clarence Over
end, Director of Athletes, in re
gard to the Tpast gridiron relations 
between Carnegie Tech and Notre 
Dame. The Tartan has the feeling 
that the letter was prompted by 
the series of articles on dubious 
practices, real or imaginary, in in
tercollegiate football which have 
appeared on the sports pages re
cently. Though Notre Dame is the 
school mentioned in the articles, is 
it only because the material avail
able was concerned directly xoith 
Notre Dames athletic policy. The 
articles are meant to expose gen
eral conditions, not specific schools. 
We would like to make it clear 
that we, as well as Mr. Overend, 
are proud of our past relations 
With Notre Dame.
Editor, the Tartan:
Carnegie Institute of Technology 
is very proud of the friendly rela
tions that existed with the Univer
sity of Notre Dame over a period 
of twenty years, beginning with a 
football game on Saturday after
noon, November 25, 1922, and end
ing with a game on October 18, 
1941. From the very start of this 
Series, under the guidance of the 
late Knute Rockne, Notre Dame 
showed every desire to fully co
operate with us. The first three 
games were played in Pittsburgh 
at Forbes Field. From 1925 the 
games were alternated between 
South Bend and Pittsburgh. In 
1928 Mr. Rockne signed a ten-year 
contract with Carnegie Tech, 
something unheard of in intercol
legiate football at' that time.
Before Mr. Rockne met his 
death in an airplane crash in 
March 1931, we had played eight 
very interesting games. In 1924 
at Forbes Field three of the famous 
Four Horsemen took part in the 
game, the other was injured and 
unable to play. Notre Dame won 
by a score of 40 to 19. In 1926 No
tre Dame lost but one of their 
eleven-game schedule, and that to 
Carnegie Tech at Forbes Field by 
a score of 19 to 0. This was the 
most talked of game in the coun
try, as Carnegie Tech was not giv
en an outside chance to win. Coach 
Rockne did not even come to Pitts
burgh for the game, but decided to 
scout the Army-Navy Game play
ed in Chicago on the same day.
In 1928 the game played at 
South Bend on Cartier Field. Car
negie Tech defeated Notre Dame 
by a score of '27 to 7. This was the 
first defeat suffered by Notre Dame 
on Cartier Field in twenty-two 
years. Carnegie Tech did not win 
another game until 1933, when 
they won by a score of 7 to 0. The 
team was coached by Howard 
Harpster, All-American quarter
back, who by the way, played on 
the two famous teams of 1926 and 
1928. The next victory was in 1937 
by a team coached by Bill Kern;

comotive are the only cheers that 
raise any noise, cheerleader Ted
dy Roofner added. The cheer 
squad thinks one reason for this 
poor response to cheers is that the 
students do not know the cheers.
Now, ignorance is no excuse in 
this case, for memeographed 
cheers have been passed out at the 
gate for most of the games. How
ever, Tech students seemed to 
think the paper was to be used to 
make airplanes, an occupation 
which absorbs many Tech viewers 
at football games. Last year the 
cheer team tried to form an or
ganized cheering squad of stu
dents. The attempt failed com
pletely.

Strohm stated The whole purpose 
of the cheerleading squad is to 
promote school spirit, to draw stuEXECUTIVE

APO Sponsors Halloween Party 
For 50 From Childrens Home
Some 50 children of four to 14 years of age from the Pittsburgh 
Juvenile Detention home on Forbes street, who are all but forgotten 
by most campus organizations except during the Christmas season, 
romped through a spirited halloween party in Thistle hall last 
Sunday afternoon. ?---------------------- ---------------------
The entertainment was sponsor
ed and managed by Alpha Phi 
Omega, national service fraternity, 
which makes as one of its projects 
at CIT the entertainment of such 
childrens groups in the nonChristmas seasons. APO also 
throws similar parties at Easter 
and, along with many other 
groups, at Christmas.
Sundays shindig included 
games, eats, and custom-made 
costumes which were created by 
the kids with the help of APO 
members last week. Each party 
goer had his or her own choice as 
to what to wear and how it was
going to be made. Funds for the 
project came irom tne proceeds of 
those few Alpha Phi Omega proj
ects which pay off in dollars and 
cents, since the organization is 
financially independent of the 
school.
For the most part, APO activ
ities consist of services donated 
to the student body free of charge, 
such as the regulation of student 
elections, custodianship of per
manent decorations, the publica
tion of the C-Book, and the opera
tion of Buk XChanj, which col
lects just enough cash to make it 
pay for itself and little more.

Talk And Clioir
During the regular period on 
November 6, CIT students will 
have the opportunity to hear the 
Reverend Lilburn B. Moseley 
speak on the topic Is the World

music sung by the mens section 
of the Cameron Choir.
Reverend Moseley has received 
degrees as a bachelor of arts at 
Wake Forest College, master of 
theology at the Southern Baptist 
Theological Seminary, and Doctor 
of Divinity at both Franklin and 
Bucknell University.
Reverend Moseley was pastor 
at the Emerson Avenue Baptist 
Church in Indianapolis for three 
years and pastor of the First 
Baptist Church there for 12 years 
before coming to Pittsburgh.

The local runners finished the 
rain drenched match with excel

home in 22 minutes, 10 seconds 
with Bob Carman burning his 
heels at 22 minutes, 17 seconds. 
John Cooper placed fifth, while 
John Muller and Hayes came in 
seventh and eighth respectively.
The crosscountry team, in setting 
the pace for the football team, may 
be destined to finish the season un
defeated. They have two remain
ing matches with Westminster on 
Nov. 2, and Slippery Rock on Nov. 
6, after which .they will display 
their power in the Tri-State meet 
on Nov. 10.
Coach Halferty feels the local 
Harriers may beat their last years

which they placed second.
The Meet with Slippery Rock 
and the Tri-State Meet are to be 
held on the Schenley Park cross
country run which will afford a 
definite advantage to the Harriers.

Defeated By Pitt 
In Hoekev Matchj
In its first game of the season, 
the Carnegie Tech womens field 
hockey team lost a hard fought 
contest to Pitt 4-1.
The visitors opened fast with 
Sue Downing, the left inner, scor
ing a goal in the first three min
utes of play. The teams battled on 
even terms with neither side scor
ing until just before the half, when 
Pitt scored again to make the half 
time score 2-0.
Tech came back early in the 
second half to score its lone goal. 
The entire Tech forward line rush
ed the Pitt goal with Dianne Bobinski, a talented freshman inner, 
passing to Jane Smith, who scored.
Pitt dominated play throughout 
the rest of the game continually 
rushing the Tech goal. The entire 
Tech defense did an excellent job 
of keeping the score down, with 
Goalie Joan Cummerton making 
six saves. However, the offense 
failed to click and the home team 
came out on the wrong end of a 
4-1 score.

A continuous drizzle of rain couldnt halt the Carnegie Tartans 
at Shaw Stadium in Cleveland Saturday as they rolled up three 
first-half touchdowns and then held on for an upset 18-13 victory 
over favored Case Institute of Technology.
Despite a first half performance* ---------------------------
which suggested a rout, the Skibos 
barely pulled out of the game with 
a win. In the second canto Dr. 
Bakers boys faced a rejuvenated 
Case team which came back with 
two touchdowns and threatened 
with a third which would have 
given them the contest.
The early part of the game 
promised a low scoring duel as 
neither team could get going on a 
sustained attack. However , the 
third time, the Tartans held the 
pigskin they struck suddenly for 
the first score.
Luchok Scores
After Oberg had carried the ball 
tc the Tartan 46, Johnny Luchok 
broke through the Rough Rider 
line at right tackle. Reversing his 
field he ran all the way alone for 
a 54 yard six-pointer. Gil Dissens 
conversion attempt was wide. Dissen also tried a 45 yard field goal 
at the end of the first quarter 
which was also wide of the mark.
The next Carnegie score was a 
result of a play planned especially 
for Case which succeeded in fool
ing them completely. On a handoff 
from Quent Holtz, Irv Shechter 
started around left end only to 
handoff again to Luchok who re
versed his field and went around 
right end without a Case player 
near him.
The last Tartan score came as 
a result of a pass interception by 
Arne Oberg which was run back 
to the Case 17. A pass from Holtz 
to Dissen was good to the two 
where Holtz took it over on two 
quarterback sneaks. The halftime 
score stood 18-0, Carnegie.
After the half the Case team 
came out with revenge in their eye 
and a passer named George Hilderbrand. Recovering a Holtz 
fumble on the 37. the Rough Rid
ers scored quickly as the third 
of three Hilderbrand passes end
ed to McPhillamy in the end zone.
Passes Connect
Hilderbrand passes accounted 
for the next Case score as he con
tinued his beautiful work with the 
wet ball. Again it was McPhillamy 
who caught the important pass on 
the one-half yard line where Hil
derbrand QB sneaked over for the 
tally.
The Case rally was halted in the 
final quarter as Tom Craig in
tercepted one of Hilderbrands 
passes on the Tech 15 and ran it 
back to the Case 35 out of danger.Scotch Lasses

Second of a Series... 
The March Letters
When Mr. March worte to the president of Notre Dame Uni
versity questioning his schools athletie policy in general, and par
ticularly his statements crediting the superb showing of the recent 
Irish elevens almost exclusively to the skill of Head Coach Frank
Leahy, it is doubtful that he ex-< 
pected an answer.
But late in January of 1947, 
Mr. March received a letter from 
the vice-president of Notre Dame, 
answering at length the queries 
in Mr. Marchs original letter.
Murphys Reply
In reply to Mr. Marchs main 
objections, concerning Father Ca
vanaughs statements in praise of 
Coach Leahy, Rev. Murphy stat
ed:
. . . Let me observe that the 
last paragraph of the clipping you 
sent me (see Tartan, October 17, 
1951) is the most salient part of. 
Father Cavanaughs speech. No 
truer words were ever spoken and 
I think it understandable that 
coaches of opposing teams who 
lose to us for a number of years 
consecutively . . . should be loath 
to run up against Frank Leahy 
and his team simply because it 
spoils their annual football rec
ord.
/Here the question, and the cor
respondence, might have ended 
had not Mr. March also approach
ed other topics in his first letter.
As a football talent scout for Rut
gers in former years, he had come 
up against the standard tactics of 
the great grid powers in obtain
ing material for their powerhouse 
squads. It was on this point also 
that he attacked Notre Dames 
policy. And this and succeeding 
topics mentioned in the course of 
the communication between the 
two men really form the meat of 
material in the subsequent let
ters.
Early Fall Practices 
Rev. Murphy, therefore, had this 
answer to Mr. Marchs question 
on early football practices, and 
other methods used in securing 
new grid material:
I think you will find that Notre 
Dame is not singular in having 
brought young football players to 
the campus before the beginning 
of the school term. If you will 
look into the matter you will find 
that a good deal of practice is 
gotten in before school opens so 
that the various coaches may 
avail themselves of two-a-day 
practice sessions in which the

fundamentals of football as it is 
played in collegiate circles are 
inculcated. Then, too, a team 
with the reputation like Notre 
Dames devotes some time each 
year to satisfying the curiosity of 
news cameramen with regard to 
the current football team and its 
candidates.
A ready answer to these com
ments arrived a few days later: 
. . . I know all about early 
fall practice and the curiosity of 
news cameramen, but usually 
when a boy is taken to a college 
campus early in July or even early 
in August it is to keep the Wolves 
from changing his mind about dear 
old Notre Dame, or Duke, or Ken
tucky, or Tennessee.
Concerning West Poisii 
Mr. March had also expressed 
some doubts as to the scholastic 
quality of many of the top foot! 
ball stars. In this respect, the vice j 
president defended at least one of 
his institutions star gridsters:
I might sdd that he (Mr. X) ; 
was tendered an appointment to ! 
the United Slates Military Acade\ 
my. This statement of mine, Mr. 
March, will offer you another op
portunity to make snide remarks 
at the University of Notre Dame : 
and its tactics, if you choose. I j 
make it, nevertheless, to show you 
how utterly and confusedly wrong 
you were in questioning Mr. Xs j 
intelectual achievements. I asj 
sume that, while you feel free to j 
attack the University of Notre I 
Dame and its high standards, you 
would not feel equally free to call 
into question the integrity of the 
United States Military Academy. ; 
March Takes Exception 
But Mr. March did not seem to 
think that West Point was as pure 
in its grid policy as the Notre 
Dame official would have liked to 
make out:
The fact that the United States 
Military Academy arranged an 
appointment for Mr. X does 
not mean a thing. Army is just 
as wrong as Notre Dame, and Ten
nessee, and Duke, and all the rest 
who have gone far beyond the 
bounds of academic integrity: Had 
Mr. X or Mr. Y ranked in the 
upper ten percent of their high 
school classes, it would not have 
been so bad but I know, and 
I think you know, that their foot
ball ability made up for what they 
lacked in scholastic attainment. 
You Huff and You Puff 
This blast at Notre Dame and 
the Military Academy could not 
go unanswered.
Next week: Sanctity, Scholar
ship, and Scholarships.

Two On CIT Staff Prominent 
In Dog-Breeding Circles
In addition to their work for the school, two of the Carnegie 
Tech. staff have managed to amass quite enviable reputations for them
selves in dog-breeding circles. Both Mrs. Elinor Snethen, associate 
professor of social work, and Mr. Stanley March, director of public 
relations, are ardent dog fanciers.*
Mrs. Snethen, who together with 
her husband owns the famous 
Shieling kennels, has been breed
ing dogs for 18 years. Concentrat
ing her attention on scottish ter
riers, her efforts have met with 
considerable success. The kennels 
most recent champion, Shielings 
Signature, adjudged best-of-show 
over approximately 2600 other 
dogs of various breeds in a com
petition held at Madison Square 
Garden. This was perhaps the 
Snethens proudest moment since 
they began breeding dogs.
Wont Rest on Laurels 
Although their scotties have 
produced about 30 American Kenbe included in the dogs name.
First Dog Show at Nine
Always interested in animals, 
Mr. March exhibited his first d$g 
when he was 9. During the more 
than 30 years he has bred fox 
terriers, he has shown them over 
most of the eastern part of the 
country. When going to college, 
Mr. March took eight puppies with 
him and helped pay for his col
lege expenses by breeding and 
selling them.
Both Mrs. Snethen and Mr. 
March are extremely proud of the 
history of the type of dog they 
breed. Originally developed in 
Scotland as hunting dogs, scot
ties have powerful teeth and jaws 
and strong, sturdy bodies to help 
in killing small animals. They arenel Club champions, been declar-j a natural breed of dog, that is, 
ed best-of-show in 40 exhibitions,: their tails and ears cannot be cut 
and best-of-breed in several hunj tQ beautify their appearance,

to rest on their laurels. There is j intelligent also, thus adding to 
another big dog show in New York their popularity with some ownin February which they intend .to i er3
enter. Originally a Hunting Dog

No Issue
There will be no issue of the 
Tartan next week, giving the 
staff an opportunity to catch 
up for nearing midsemester 
exams. The next issue will be 
available on Tuesday, Novem
ber 13.
Cheering[Continued, from Page 2] 
in the fall many students apply. 
Maybe the trouble is that every
one wants to be a leader and no 
one a follower.
The lack of school spirit is com
paratively new on Carnegie Tech 
campus. The college lost its en
thusiasm when Tech began its 
long losing streak and has never 
regained it. Athletic Director 
Buddy Overend recalls the day 
when Tech boasted the greatest 
spirit and the finest promoter of 
that spirit. A1 Minetti.
Big Supporter 
While he was a student, A1 spur
red both the team and the students 
to push hard for victory. Even 
after he graduated A1 followed the 
team to its games; and when the 
students chanted, We want Al, 
he would jump onto the field to 
i lead Tech in resounding cheers. 
; At the Case game four years ago 
Al leaped from the stands and 
cheered again for his team. As Al 
cheered he had a heart attack and 
died several hours later.

they defeated Notre Dame by a
score of 9 to 7.
On July 1, 1937, our new athletic 
policy went into effect, and it took 
four years until all of the scholar
ship holders had graduated. The 
worst defeat of the entire series 
came in 1940 at which time Car
negie was defeated at South Bend 
by a score of 61 to 0. At that time 
our contract had one more year to 
run and there was a question in 
the minds of the Trustees and the 
Athletic Board as to whether to 
cancel this last and remaining 
game. After careful consideration 
it was decided to play the game 
and end the long series on October 
18, 1941.
On Friday night prior to this last 
game, I personally talked with 
Frank Leahy, then Coach of Notre 
Dame, and explained to him in de
tail our predicament, stating that 
our material was at its lowest ebb 
in our history, and asked of him 
a special favorthat they go easy
on our men. The score of the game 
ended: Notre Dame 16Carnegie 
Tech O. So draw your own con
clusions.
Knowing that this was our last 
game, Mr. Leahy advised me that, 
if at any time we wished to come 
back on their schedule, all we had 
to do was say the word.
We can all look back to twenty 
harmonious years in our associa
tion with the University of Notre 
Dame. No college could have been 
more fair and square than they 
were with Carnegie Tech.
I remain,
Clarence Overend, 
Director of Athletics.

Considerable Interest Shoivn 
In Weekend Square Dance
It was gratifying to see such a 
large group enjoying themselves 
at the Square Dance last Saturday 
night. Eero Davidson and his 
group were given excellent coop
eration in the practice sets. There
fore, when the dances got into 
gear everyone really had an en
joyable time. The novelty num
bers which helped to mix the 
dances were a wonderful method 
of getting everyone acquainted.
Credit goes to Bill Bartoli and 
his helpers for the noval fall dec
orations in Thistle Hall. They did 
a good job of creating the right 
atmosphere.
Will Schnarrenberger and his
crew at the Black Cat were a wel
come oasis between dances when 
the crowd mobbed them for re
freshments.
Mention must be made of the 
novel posters whose striking ap
