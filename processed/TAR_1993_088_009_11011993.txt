Two weeks ago, Student Senate passed 
a resolution by a vote of 18-2-4 that 
would recommend to the Board of Trust
ees to give the Graduate Student Orga
nization (GSO) 60 percent of the Gradu
ate Activities Fee instead of the current
37 percent, a difference of $50,000. At 
last Tuesdays Senate meeting, the pro
posal was reconsidered and tabled for a 
future meeting by a vote of 17-3-1.
The resolution, drafted by undergradu
ate and graduate student leaders, evalu
ated the current 63 percent allocation of 
the Graduate Activities Fee to Student 
Senate and found that only 40 percent of 
that money paid for graduate participa
tion in activities. This percentage was 
derived from an average of graduate 
participation in all Senate-funded ac
tivities [Senate allows GSO to. receive 
more of Grad Activities Fee, 9/25].
At the Student Senate meeting, Lara 
Wolfson, president of GSO, said the ex
tra money that GSO receives will go 
towards the distribution of FOCUS, the 
faculty newsletter, to graduate students, 
graduate orientation programs, gradu
ate seminars, research symposiums, 
graduate picnics, the Titled Square, and 
a graduate handbook similar to The 
Word, as well as other activities.
Jim Albert, Public Relations chair for 
Student Senate, proposed to table the 
resolution. I think we [Student Sena
tors] were wrong to pass it in one night, 
said Albert. We needed a lot of new 
information, like what did GSO want 
the money for and why were graduate 
students against it.
Albert said that passing the resolu
tion originally was wrong and negli
gent. He said, I am very glad Senate is 
reconsidering it.
Albert also said that he plans to talk to 
his constituents before making a deci
sion. My intention was not to kill it on 
the table, he said.
David Wolpert, Student Government 
president, expressed his disappointment 
with Student Senate after the resolu
tion was tabled. Many students have 
criticized Student Senate for not being 
responsive to students needs, said 
Wolpert. If all of you needed more infor
mation, people were available to answer 
your questions. Are you really going to 
go to constituents and gather more in
formation?
Lara Wolfson, president of GSO, said 
that she expected the resolution to be 
tabled. The piece passed was an impor
tant piece of legislation, said Wolfson. 
They should have said we needed more 
information and postponed it. They made

CMU considers shuttle merger
Pitt, others look at transit safety options
By JASON TOGYER
Tartan Assistant News Editor
Carnegie Mellon University is investigating 
a number of possible plans for expanding the 
Shuttle/Escort service currently offered by Cam
pus Police.
Campus Police Chief James LaPaglia said 
that the University has been discussing vari
ous proposals with both the University of Pitts
burgh and Chatham College for over a year. 
There is a proposal on the table, said 
LaPaglia. However, he said, There are cer
tainly a lot of items open to discussion.
All of the proposals being discussed would 
expand access to Pittsburgh neighborhoods for 
CMU students, but they are very different in 
execution. ;
LaPaglia said that one proposal would in
volve discount passes on Port Authority of Al
legheny County (PAT) buses for the student 
bodies and staffs of all Pittsburgh-area univer
sities. Another calls for Pitt and CMU to share 
the shuttle.services they currently have. This 
would enable-Pittstudents to ride CMU shuttles, 
and CMU students to ride Pitt shuttles. An
other possible solution, said LaPaglia, wouldbe 
for Chatham and CMU to both buy into Pitts 
shuttle program.
We havent come to any agreements yet, 
said LaPaglia. Its still being negotiated. Weve 
had several meetings between [the Univer
sity], Pitt, and Chatham.
John Morgan, assistant director for transpor
tation in Pitts Department of Parking and 
Transportation, said that the idea for an Oak
land-wide transportation consortium came out
of a need for greater student safety.
The view that Pitt has is that this is a univer
sity community, saidMorgan. Its notjust CM>U, 
Pitt, Chatham, and Carlow [College] by them
selves.
If we do a better job in th Oakland community, 
everyone will benefit, he said. We have to in
crease safety for all of our students. We have 
students now who are sharing our streets, our 
sidewalks, and apartments. By making them safe, 
we make everyone safe.
Morgan said that the groups discussing coop
erative transportation efforts include CMU, Pitt, 
Chatham, Carlow, and the VeteransAdministra
tion hospital. The City of Pittsburgh Planning 
Commission and PAT are also involved.
Obviously, providing service to as many stu
dents as possible who live off-campus is the best 
possible outcome, LaPaglia said. But we have to 
be very careful that we dont enter into an agree
ment that overloads CMUs shuttles and hurts 
CMU students.
During peak hours, we ran our shuttles to peak 
capacity, he said. Our shuttles go to many of the 
same locations that [Pitts] shuttles do. If Pitt 
students were to begin riding CMUs shuttles in 
large numbers, said LaPaglia,. they might be 
taking seats that we would like to have our stu
dents in. Theres no way that I want to see us enter 
into an agreement our students would not be 
happy with:
Morgan said that the University of Pittsburgh 
currently operates five bus routes, servicing Squir
rel Hill, Shadyside, North Oakland, South Oak
land, and the Pitt campus area. Another bus, 
equipped with a wheelchair lift, operates for the

GSIA motivates fourth grade 
students to stay in school
Dante funded for volcanic study
By EDWARD HAYES
Tartan Staffwriter
Carnegie Mellon Universitys Robotics Institute 
has agreed to clean and upgrade Dante, an eight
legged robot thats designed to crawl into and 
explore volcanoes. The repairs were done to ready 
the robot for a mission in June to explore Mount 
Spurr, a volcano 80 miles west of Anchorage, Alaska. 
The mission is designed to study the volcano and to 
give NASA some valuable research on the use of 
robots in interplanetary exploration.
Dantes primary mission is to descend into Mt. 
Spurr and collect gas samples. According to John 
Bares, the project manager, the purpose of the 
project is to show robotic operation in a very 
extreme environment.
The volcano has already erupted three times last 
year and scientists say that another eruption is not 
scheduled to occur for another 40 years. The prob
lem is the unpredictability of volcanoes. So, in
stead of risking human lives, scientists will send 
Dante.
This will be Dantes second attempted mission. 
Last year, it began its descent into the 850-footdeep crater of Mt. Erebus, an active volcano in 
Antarctica, when the mission was aborted due to 
damage in its fiber optic communications line.
The line was kinked, forcing Dante developers to 
make some changes. They added a separate wire 
which was designed to unwind as the robot lowered 
into the volcano and to keep the fiber optic cable 
straight. Unfortunately, it tightened and then got . 
tangled. As a result, the robot lost communication  
with the base station.
The Mt. Spurr mission will also benefit NASA. 
Theyre interested in exploration in very extreme 
conditions, said Bares. If the mission proves to be 
a success, NASA may use robots to perform plan
etary exploration. Its for that reason that NASA 
has given CMUs Robotics Institute $1 million, and 
CMU has been promised $500,000 from the Ad
vanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA).
The journey down Mt. Spurr will not be an easy 
task for Dante. The crater itself is not on the 
mountains summit, but on the side at an elevation 
over 7,500 feet. On one side, theres an almostvertical wall that stands 1,000 feet high. On the 
other side is a wide flat rim and a 20-45 degree 
slope to the crater floor. This side was blown out by 
eruptions.
According to Bares, the main goal of this project; 
is to prove that this can be done. After this 
mission the Dante robot is expected to make an
other descent into Mt. Erebus at the end of next 
year.

Last Monday, GSIA held a sup
portersluncheon announcing the 
establishment of the I Have a 
Dream [I Have] program, a 
fundraising effort that will pro
vide college tuition for Fort Pitt 
Elementary Schools fourth 
grade for two years if they 
graduate high school. On the 
following Tuesday, GSIA stu
dents who volunteered to par
ticipate in the program visited 
Fort Pitt to kick off the pro
gram.
The [I Have] program is in
tended to get support that most 
disadvantaged children need 
to cope with the educational 
system and to acquire the ba
sic skills necessary to function 
in our society, said Eugene 
Lang, chairman of REFAC Tech
nology Development Corporation 
and chairman of the national I 
Have a Dream Foundation.
Lang said that the program 
involvs a sponsor, such as GSIA, 
to provide a long-term commit
ment to grade not later than 
fourth, and undertake to provide
Lang said that the program was 
brought to GSIA almost by acci
dent.Lang had served on GSIAs 
Board of Advisors for sevenyears, 
and since, the I Have a Dream 
program was established with 
156 other schools in 53 cities 
and27 states. GSIAs program 
is the first I Have a Dream 
program established in Penn
sylvania, and the second pro
gram sponsored by a business 
school.
Natalie Taaffe, associate 
dean of GSIA, said that she 
sent email to the student body 
last spring to get their input, 
and the response was over
whelming. According to 
Taaffe, Fort Pitts I Have a 
Dream program has more 
than 120 tutors, triple the ex
pected level of participation. 
Taaffe said that GSIA tu
tors will go to Fort Pitt two days 
a week. Seventy GSIA students 
go on Wednesday and 50 go on 
Thursday. All tutors tutor from 
8:15 to 10:30 in the morning. 
Some students have revolved 
their class schedules around tu-;

Fans rush football field 
after game, 80 injured
MADISON, Wis., October 31 (AP) 
Hospital officials say two people are in 
critical condition after thousands 
rushed onto the field at a University of 
Wisconsin football game.
Earlier, officials had putthe number 
of critical injuries at seven.
Officials say 16 people have been 
hospitalized. In all, 80 people were 
examined or treated in Madison hospi
tals after the incident.
The people were hurt when chainlink and rail fences collapsed under a 
wave of jubilant fans pouring onto the 
'college football field.
A spokesperson for the university 
police says approximately 12,000 spec
tators scrambled out of five student 
sections at Camp Randall Stadium 
after the Badgers defeated the Michi
gan Wolverines 13-10. Itwas the first 
Wisconsin victory over Michigan since 
1981.
The universitys chief of police says 
all the police in town couldnt have 
stopped the tragedy.
Chief Susan Riseling says police 
were told to fall back and surround the 
goalposts to prevent fans from climb
ing on them.
U.S. refused to support 
revolutionaries in Iraq
LONDON, October 31 (AP) -r-. A 
British newspaper says the United 
States refused to support a plot by 
Iraqi dissidents to kill Iraqi President 
Saddam Hussein and may have be; trayed the coup plotters. Meanwhile, 
;in Iraq, United Nations (U.N.) weap' ons inspectors say they have found no
* hidden Scud missiles or other banned 
 arms during a month-long sweep of
 the nation.
; The Sunday Times of London says
 the. Clinton administration said it
 would not back the plot because tur
moil in Iraq could endanger the Middle 
East peace process.
: Later, it says, coup leaders and hun
dreds of others were imprisoned. A 
dissident is quoted as suspecting some
one connected with the Americans 
betrayed the operation because all ten 
officers on a list given to the Central
Intelligence Agency (CIA) were ar
rested.
The newspaper said most of the coup 
plotters were probably executed.
In Iraq, the U.N. team leader told 
reporters today that the group con
ducted a thorough search using heli
copters and ground-penetrating ra
dar.
U.S. intelligence reports say Hussein 
has hidden more than 200 Scud-type 
missiles from U.N. inspectors. And a 
U.N. special commission says it be
lieves some of the missiles have not 
been accounted for.
Iraq claims all of the missiles have 
been destroyed or were fired in earlier 
conflicts.
Iraq is required to destroy its re
maining missiles under the 1991 U.N. 
cease-fire resolution that ended the 
Persian Gulf War.
California residents cope with wildfire aftermath
ALTADENA, California, October 31 
(AP)  Firefighters are continuing to 
gain the upper hand on. the wildfires 
that have scorched a 200-miie strip 
across Southern California. Theyre 
being helped by cool, moist weather.
Authorities say the 5,700 acres blaze 
above Altadena is 85 percentcontained, 
and a 39,000 acre fire in Ventura 
County is 90 percent contained. . .
.Nearly 170,000. acres have been 
burned and nearly 800 structures are 
damaged or destroyed, including 650 
homes.
Victims of fire-ravaged Laguna 
Beach today turned to churches for 
solace. At churches and homes around 
the region, victims stepped forward to 
help others displaced by the flames.
One couple, Jack and Elaine Lund, 
lost their home when a wildfire leveled 
their home near Emerald Bay. But 
when they went to church today, they 
volunteered one of their few remain
ing possessions to help others left home
less in last weeks firestorm. The Lunds 
are lending their pickup truck to the 
clean-up effort.
Murderer faces 
prison instead of 
execution
ATTICA, New York, October 31 (AP) 
A convicted murderer who was caught 
in a tug-of-war between two states is 
now at a maximum-security prison in 
New York.
Thomas Grasso arrived at the Attica 
Correctional Facility this morning to 
serve a 20-year sentence for killing a 
New York man. He arrived in New York 
last night from Oklahoma.
Grasso was scheduled to be executed 
in Oklahoma earlier this month for kill
ing a woman but New York wanted him 
to serve his time there first.
Both states took the matter to court 
and a judge ruled in favor of New York. 
Grasso had preferred execution in Okla
homa to a lengthy prison stay in New 
York.
Voters react to 
problems in offyear election
PITTSBURGH, October 30 (AP)  
From the row-house wards of New York 
and Boston to the edgy streets of Miami, 
the twin obsessions of ethnicity and crime 
are looming over the skylines in 
Tuesdays big-city mayoral elections.
Call it a back-to-basics movement, one 
sign of a no-frills election year.
In Pittsburgh, Democrat Tom Murphy 
is expected to cruise to an easy victory 
over underfunded challenger Kathy 
Matta, the Republican candidate. Demo
crats outnumber Republicans six to one 
in the city.
The nations only two governors races
 in New Jersey and Virginia  are 
being driven by the gut-level issues of 
taxes and handguns. Voter initiatives 
across the country focus on money, term 
limits, and crime.
Political observers say voters are re
acting to social disorganization, an in
crease in ethnic tension, and an increase 
in class tension.
Seven die in 
Belfast shooting 
on Halloween
BELFAST, Northern Ireland, Octo
ber 31 (AP)  An outlaw Protestant 
group is claiming responsibility for an 
attack on a pub in Northern Ireland that 
killed seven people.
Police and witnesses say two gunmen 
shouted, Trick or treat! before opening 
fire last night in a crowded pub in the 
largely Catholic village of Greysteel. At 
first, customers thought the men were 
setting off fireworks.
The Ulster Defense Association (UDA) 
had vowed revenge after a bombing by 
the Irish Republican Army (IRA) last 
weekend that killed 10 people.
The UDA wants Northern Ireland to 
remain under British rule, while the 
IRA wants to reunite the province with

Raymond Tudek, 61, was being treated 
at the Kane Center in McKeesport for 
depression that followed a stroke.
A hospital official says he sneaked 
into a workshop where splints are made 
and locked the door Tuesday afternoon.
A nurse forced her way into the shop

Health care plan 
negotiable, says 
Clinton advisor
WASHINGTON, October 31 (AP)  
The Clinton administration says any 
overhaul of the health care system must 
guarantee security for all Americans.
Ira Magaziner, a senior health care 
adviser to the President, says theres 
room for compromise among the various 
plans being floated. But he tells NBCTVs Meet the Press that one thing isnt 
negotiable  access to benefits that 
doesnt go away.
One congressman whos been outspo
ken on the issue, Pete Stark (D., Ca.) 
says he thinks the final package will be 
a mixture of various proposals. Theres 
no Mil out there now that can pass in
tact, he says.
Another congressman, Jim Cooper (R., 
Tenn.), says theres no such thing as free 
health care.
Cooper says the government can help 
the poor, but everyone else has a respon
sibility to pay their own way.

West Bank 
security plan
JERUSALEM, October 31 (AP)  An 
Israeli newspaper says the government 
has agreed to a Palestinian plan to ap
point one policeman for every 100 Arabs 
living in the occupied territories.
And another daily says Israel will be 
offering autonomy in a larger area
around Jericho than originally esti
mated.
Theres no official government com
ment on either report.
The size of the police force had been a 
sticking point in peace talks with the 
Palestinian Liberation Organization 
(PLO). Israel had been uncomfortable 
with the demand for 25,000 police, say

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  1 November 19933
Biology symposium focuses on hi-tech
By JASON HEINLEIN
Tartan Staffwriter
The Keck Symposium on Computa
tional Biology began on Sunday, Octo
ber 24 in Mellon Institute and ended 
on Monday, October 25.
It drew biologists, chemists, and com
puter scientists from all over the coun
try to discuss the most up-to-date and 
ground-breaking ideas in the area of 
computational biology.
Computational biology is the use of 
computers and mathematical meth
ods to solve very large problems in 
biology. These problems can range 
from understanding the formation and 
the molecular structure of a protein, to 
the long and laborious process of data 
analysis.
Because computer technology has 
advanced so far, these problems will 
have practical solutions in the near 
future.
Two of the 11 lectures given in the 
symposium dealt with these problems 
exactly. They were given by Carnegie 
'Mellons faculty members, associate 
chemistry professor Charles L. Brooks 
III, and Dr. D. Lansing Taylor, direc
tor of the science and technology cen
ter.
Brooks addressed the problem of 
understanding protein structure and 
function. Using computers, biologists 
-hope to someday be able to determine 
the structure of proteins. Knowledge 
of the structures will allow them to 
manipulate proteins to control vital 
body functions and cure genetic dis
eases.
If & protein with a known structure 
is changed very slightly, and then ana
lyzed by a computer, biologists hope
that the computer will be able to dis
cover the change and interpret how 
that part of the protein fits into the 
immense puzzle of larger proteins.
Taylor addressed the problem of data 
analysis with a light microscope. Cur
rently, when information is gathered 
with a light microscope, it is seen by 
the scientist by looking through the 
eye piece. Therefore, the information 
received is only that which our brains 
are capable of seeing and understand
ing.
However, if in the future, the light 
microscope was connected to a com
puter, many of the data interpreta
tions could be made better and faster. 
The computer would display its inter
pretation of the specimen on a moni
tor. The image would display many 
characteristics of the specimen that 
the scientist would be unable to see 
otherwise.
Computer aided analysis would have 
a great effect on the biological commu
nity. Current methods are very slow, 
laborious, and inaccurate, and after 
years of work biologists have been 
able to determine only crude amino 
acid structures and genetic mutations.
According to Dr. Susan Henry, dean 
of the Mellon College of Science, biolo
gists must know how those proteins 
function in order to do something medi
cally important.
They must know exactly how the 
proteins interact and function before 
they can control the actions of such 
proteins.
When such an in-depth understand
ing of proteins is finally achieved, 
Henry predicts that it will result in 
rational drug design. This is when a

Shuttle merger talks underway

disabled as needed. In addition, Pitt also 
operates an on-call service in the eve
nings similar to CMUs Escort.
Morgan said that between August 28 
and last week, Pitts buses had carried 
250,000'riders.
LaPaglia said that the possibility of 
having CMU pay Pitt so that the 
Universitys students could ride Pitts 
shuttles was discussed as well. The 
problem with that, he says, is that all 
University of Pittsburgh students are 
assessed $30 per semester regardless of 
whether they use Pitts shuttles. We 
want to be certain that were not hurting 
ourselves with this, said LaPaglia.
LaPaglia says that any such joint ser
vice would not be ready in the immeadiate 
future. Lets say we decide to pay a 
certain fee to enable our students to ride 
their shuttle, said LaPaglia. A joint 
venture takes a lot more planning, a lot
more anticipation. Im just so afraid our 
students would be displaced by Pitt stu
dents if they rode our shuttle.
I dont think thats true, Morgan 
said, but was unable to elaborate on that 
possibility further.
PAT has been approached about the 
possibility of discount bus passes being 
made available to CMU students. They 
didnt want to just limit it to student 
passes, said LaPaglia, they wanted 
the entire University to be able to get the 
passes, and for the University to subsi
dize the cost. LaPaglia said that the 
cost of the request was unreasonable. 
LaPaglia said that the universities 
are currently discussing going to PAT en 
masse and seeing if they all could obtain 
the passes for their students and staff. 
It may be more appealing to them and 
lucrative if we can say, we have X thou
sands of students here that will increase 
your business, he said.
LaPaglia said that he will be meetingwith the newly-formed Student Safety 
Committee this Wednesday to get their 
recommendations on shuttle service. The 
topics on the agenda are likely to include 
possible expansions of the shuttle ser
vice, including pushing the current CMU 
routes out to serve Squirrel Hill.
I think that it would place an undue 
hardship on students who picked apart
ments this year based on the shuttle 
routes, said LaPaglia, who feels that 
shuttle headways and crowding would 
increase as a result. If such a change 
was to be made, it would have to be made 
early enough that students could be no
tified before they entered into rental 
contracts.
Were not really looking at conve
nience, said Pitts Morgan. Its more 
about making students as safe as we 
can. Thats the purpose of the shuttle 
system.
Correction...
Last week's article, Sick building syndrome in UCC has residents concerned, requires a clarification. In the first 
column on page 3, a quote from Ken Burner is immediately followed by a quote from Sandy Zeher, and then another 
quote from Burner.
In the graphic included with last weeks Senate allows GSO to receive more of Grad Activities Fee on page 7, two 
of the pie charts are incorrect. In 1993, Student Senate receives 63 percent of the GAF, while the Graduate Student 
Organization receives 37 percent. In 1994, Senate will receive 51.5 percent of the GAF, while GSO will receive 48.5 
percent. The figures for 1995 were correct. 
In Campus explores countries of Africa last week, Oopali Operajitas dance performanced was mischaracterized. It 
was not part of the International Festival.
The subheadline to last weeks article Women protest sexual violence should have read, Take Back the Night march 
attracts 300. In the same article, Engineering and Public Policy graduate student Donna Riley was misidentified. She 
was part of the collective that planned the march.

Audience Participation:
Erik Altmann, a graduate SCS 
! student, spoke in opposition to 
I the recently passed Activities Fee 
' split between GSO and Senate.
Some of his concerns included 
| proportionality of grad students 
to undergrads, the invisibility of 
GSO on campus, salaries for GSO 
executive committee members,
' uncertainty of how GSO will use 
this money, fiscal shortfall of 
$50,000 faced by the rest of the 
campus community, and the 
hastiness with which Senate 
' passed this proposal.
Howard Read, GSO Treasurer, 
then spoke presenting statistics 
and evidence which disputed 
points made by Altmann.
Michael Loomis, a GSIA stu
dent, urged Senate to put more 
thought, time, and discussion into 
proposals before they pass such 
J important legislation.
Mark Kantrowitz, current co
liaison officer of GSO, also spoke 
in support of the Activities Fee 
J split, and rebutted points made 
by Altmann.
Steve Lanterman, a staff mem
ber in chemical engineering, 
Heinz school student, and former
CMU undergrad, gave some sta
tistics in opposition of the Activi
ties Fee split.
Jen Potter from the Womens 
Center issued a formal apology to 
Senate for breaking the poster 
policy last week with the unau
thorized Take Back the Night 
banner hanging above Doherty 
Hall.
Spencer Brown, former CIT 
senator and undergrad, voiced 
his opinion against the Activities 
Fee split and urged Senate to 
make a motion to reconsider the 
legislation.
Ex-Officio Reports:
AB (Matt Adler): The Interna
tional Festival went very well, 
and AB events during the Festi
val were excellent. AB Coffee
house will have comedian Mas
ter Lee on Saturday.
Go see AB films this week; 
Night of the Living Dead plays 
Thursday, Army of Darkness on 
Friday, and The Maze on Sun
day. All films are at DH 2210.
The latest issue that AB is ex
ploring is apartments near cam
pus to be used as an AB chalet to 
service entertainers from out of 
town, and AB off campus mem
bers who need to stay late on 
campus doing AB related work. 
Send your comments to asso'cs. 
student-senate.
SDC (Jonmichael Chew): 
Saturdays film is Sleepless in 
Seattle. SDC plans to conduct an 
investigation on microwave use 
in dorms where residents anony
mously mark on floor plans pro
vided by RAs, where they believe 
microwaves are in use. Studies of 
electricity use in those rooms will 
be conducted to determine 
whether or not to remove the cur
rent ban on microwaves in dorms. 
RA applications are due soon. 
Te1 elisions will be given to dorm 
.tlooi'i soon.
Greek Council (Demian 
Johnston): Take Back the Night 
went really well and Greek Coun
cil would like to congratulate the 
Womens Center Collective. The 
issue of the Activities Fee split is 
very important to Greek Council. 
Since we receive no money, the 
money lost to big events (Carni
val, Sweepstakes, Thistle, AB,
etc.) will hit the Greeks at the 
only place we benefit from the 
Activities Fee.
Greeks also have significantly 
different patterns of participa
tion in Senate funded activities. 
Knowing Senates fiscal policy, I 
know that GSO wont do the same 
for Greek Council.
We, as Greeks, generally pay 
over $600 a year in dues which 
funds our booths, our buggies, 
and all other administrative af
fairs of our organizations. We 
dont get our Activities Fee back 
so that we can do buggy, booth or 
anything else.
We, like many other Greeks, 
also feel we dont get our $100 
worth of student activities. Greek 
Council urges Senate to rediscuss 
the GSO split.
Were trying to get together a 
demolition competition with AB 
at Skibo Hall in early December.
GSO (Lara Wolfson): The next 
GSO meeting is Wednesday, No
vember 3 at 5:30 pm in Skibo 12. 
We will discuss allowing a ROTC 
vote on Faculty Senate.
Lara disputed a rumor that 
GSO wants the Activities Fee split 
because the executive board 
wants a pay raise.
She also noted that all execu
tive board members will have 
graduated before the split takes 
effect.
Faculty Senate (Dean 
Murphy): None.
Student Affairs (Pat Hamed): 
We are very pleased with the 
results of the International Fes
tival. Well be sending out evalu
ations of the Festival soon. Next 
years theme is Europe, and we 
begin planning for it very soon.
On Thursday, November 4 at 
7:30 pm in the West Wing TV 
Room well be having a forum on 
alcohol use a CMU.
Pumpkin carving will be Fri
day, October 29, from 4:30-6:30 
pm on the Cut; it is sponsored by 
the junior class.
There will be a seminar on in
come tax next Tuesday from 12 
1:30 pm in the Wherret Room for 
anyone who has questions on fill
ing out returns.
President (Dave Wolpert): 
None.
Treasurer (Dave Martin): We 
only have 10 petitions in for elec
tions so far.
Chair (Burt Holzman): Please 
refrain from ad hominem attacks 
in discussion. Address the issue, 
not the person.
Committee Reports:
Academic Affairs (Dawn 
Wallhausen): We got the results 
of the AA survey compiled: 80

dents should not be required to 
buy computers; 53 percent are for 
plus/minus grading; 87 percent 
would like computer registration 
to be available. We will have a 
meeting tomorrow at 4 pm in the 
Senate office.

DeRoss): Our meetings are Tues
days in the Tartan lounge at 6:30 
pm. Were revivingthe Gym Com
mittee created by Senate a few

escort driver about shuttle ser
vice to Squirrel Hill; were going 
to develop a survey of Squirrel 
Hill residents to determine where

A pipe broke below the founda
tion of Skibo causing that nasty 
odor by Entropy; the Physical 
Plant doesnt want to rectify it 
because Skibo is set to be demol
ished in December, but were 
working on that.
Were trying to quicken the pro

10/21 LEAVING SCENE OF ACCIPENT, 9:01 pm. At 6:56 pm, a staff 
member was walking east in front of 
Webster Hall on Fifth Avenue. She be
gan to cross the street at a traffic light 
when she noticed a red pick-up truck in 
the westbound lanes. The driver pro
ceeded through the intersection, turn
ing north on Dithridge Street.
Since the staff member was already 
halfway through the intersection, it was 
presumed that the driver of the truck 
would permit her to cross. Instead, the 
truck continued through the intersec
tion, causing the staff member to throw 
herself backwards to prevent from being, 
struck. She said she felt the rear bumper 
of the truck brush against her thigh as 
she fell to the pavement, bruising the 
right rear portion of her upper leg.
The truck then proceeded for about 20 
yards and then stopped. A passenger 
exited the truck, and the staff member 
asked, "Didnt you see me? The passen
ger said that the driver didnt see her 
because hes blind in his left eye. The 
passenger asked if she was hurt, and she 
said that she wasnt sure and was call
ing the police.
The staff member left the area, went 
.to Mellon Institute, and dialed 911. A 
City Police unit was dispatched, but the 
responding officer did not take a report. 
She was not satEfied and later spoke 
with Campus Polce.
10/22 MEDICAL ESCORT, 8:21 pm. 
A student called Ckmpus Police and said 
that he had been vomiting since 3 pm 
due to excessive amounts of whiskey 
and beer which he consumed the night 
before. He told tie responding officer 
! that he was unableto keep any solid food 
or liquid in his stanach.
Upon arrival, officers found the stu
dents extremely dizzy and complained 
of numbness in his legs and feet. The 
student was transported to Presbyte
rian Hospital.
10/23 ASSAULT/MEDICAL ES
CORT, 1:01 am. An officer was stopped 
by a student on the Fraternity Quad 
who said that a friend of his was hit by 
another student. Upon arrival, the re
porting officer found the student sitting 
on the front porch of his fraternity. He 
had a 3" laceration above his left eye 
which had stopped bleeding. First aid 
was administered by the reporting of
ficer, although no other injuries were 
obvious at that time.
The student said that he was hanging 
outside of another fraternity when he 
was bumped by somebody who turned 
and hit him in the eye. The fighter could 
not be located, but the student said that 
he had six witnesses. Student EMS re
sponded and checked the student, who 
was later transported to Presbyterian 
Hospital.
10/24 FIGHT, 6 pm. A staff member 
called Campus Police to Gesling Sta
dium, fearing trouble after the mens 
soccer game between Brandeis Univer
sity and CMU.
As the game ended, several fights broke 
out on the field between Brandeis and 
CMUs mens soccer players. Fans from 
the dorm side of the stadium came onto 
the field, where numerous physical and 
verbal confrontations took place.
City Police was radioed for assistance, 
after which several city units responded. 
Order was restored with the teams, and 
the fans were separated. The stadium 
was cleared of all fans to prevent further
incidents.
Brandeis University was escorted to 
their bus and left the area without fur
ther incidents.
10/25 CRIMINAL MISCHIEF, 2:24 
am. A fraternity member told Campus 
Police that people were throwing beer 
cans at his fraternity houses front patio.
As soon as one of the cans hit the glass 
front door, the student and three other 
house brothers ran to the patio area and 
saw somebody entering a neighboring 
fraternity. The member wanted a report 
filed because of similar incidents in the 
past between the two fraternities. Both 
parties said that they would like to take 
care of the problem on their own. No one 
was seen actually throwing the cans at 
the house.
10/25 VEHICLE/PEDESTRIAN 
ACCIDENT, 4:54 pm. Somebody called 
Campus Police saying that a person on a 
bicycle was hit by a vehicle on the comer 
of Fifth and Morewood Avenues. Cam
pus Police, Student EMS, and several 
city police units responded. Upon ar
rival, the police found a student laying 
unconscious in the middle of the inter
section.
While attending to the student, the 
driver of the van that hit the student 
approached police. He said that as he 
was driving south, he started to make a 
left turn onto Fifth Avenue when the 
bicyclist collided with his vehicle. The 
traffic signal was green when he made 
the left turn.
The student was transported to Pres
byterian Hospital via ambulance. The 
students backpack and bicycle was taken 
to Baker Hall 155 by the reporting of
ficer for safekeeping.
At 8:30 pm, Campus Police checked 
with Presbyterian Hospital personnel 
and was advised that the student was in 
stable condition and being admitted. Stu
dent Affairs was notified.
10/25 MEDICAL, 5:48 pm. A student 
was playing soccer on the IM Field when 
he collided with the goalie to kick a goal. 
Everybody on the field heard a loud 
crack as the student broke his right 
lower leg.
The student was calm when Student 
EMS arrived. An orthopedic surgeon 
was also summoned. She straightened 
the students leg to be splinted. Student 
EMS assisted, and the student was taken 
to Presbyterian Hospital via ambulance.
10/27 ODOR OF SMOKE, 1:15 am. 
Campus Police received a call that there 
was haze and an odor of smoke in Skibo. 
Officers arrived and found a very strong 
odor, similar to that of burning rubber, 
on the first floor near the MAC ma
chines. Campus Police searched the en
tire area but could not find the source of 
the odor. Campus Police contacted the 
fire department for assistance in deter
mining the source of the odor. At 2:27 
am, another search was conducted, again 
with no results.
10/27 CRIMINAL MISCHIEF, 3:01 
am. An anonymous caller said that he 
heard a lot of banging at the Mudge CTower entrance door leading into the 
courtyard. The caller said that when he 
came out to check on the noise, he saw 
somebody running from the area into a 
dorm room. The caller went to the room 
and knocked on the door. He recognized 
the person who answered the door as the 
one running from the courtyard.
The caller told Campus Police that he ; 
had been known to damage the same ; 
door in the past, but everyone does not ; 
want to confront him for fear of reprisal.' ; 
A maintenance request was submitted. ; 
The caller was concerned for the ; 
buildings safety because when the door ; 
is broken, it allows access to anyone.
10/27 THEFT, 2:47 pm. Computing ; 
Services reported that somebody had ; 
removed the mouse balls and plastic ; 
rings from seven computers in the Wean ; 
5209 clustr. The theft was discovered | 
at 10:18 am. The value of the missing ; 
parts was unknown at the time of the ; 
report.
The Tartan prints the weekly Crime 
and Incident Report under the following

I dont have a problem with Student Senate 
tabling the resolution, as long as it comes up this 
semester, said Tm Mallo, a doctorate chemical 
engineering studeit and member of GSO. They 
should talk to their constituents. Im glad there is 
discussion.
Most people woiid have said GSO was good last 
week, said Wolf.on. I am disappointed in 
[Senates] reconsidring of the motion.
Wolfson said tha it was like Student Senate 
said, Oh, somebodjcomplained, so I take it back.

science, came out gainst the plan during the

that Student Senate is under

 Lara Wolfson, GSO president
tion period of 
Tuesdays Senate 
meeting.
Altmann said that 
he had two concerns 
about GSO; The 
numbers were 
abused, and there 
was no plan.
Altmann said, GSCcame in a bunch of data that 
begged the question f whether their claim was 
legitimate. People aw the data and simply 
overinterpreted it. Asfor a plan, no organization 
presented a $50,000 rquest without a budget. 
Mallo, gathered the ercentage data of graduate 
involvement presentd in the resolution. Mallo 
said, How well are gnduates represented by ac
tivities? Graduates wold rather see money go to 
different activities.... Graduates were undergradu
ates once before. They ire no longer interested any 
more [in undergraduae activities].
Wolfson said that tfere is a difference between 
graduate and undergaduate students. She used 
the example of CMU mblications to support her 
claim.
She said, When gaduate students get books 
about CMU, there is adifference. When graduates 
apply, you receive aDook for the discipline you 
study. There is no mation of any graduate activi
ties except GSO. Urlergraduates get a generic 
book that list lots c activities. It makes a big
difference.
If graduate students are different from under
graduates, then Greeks are different from nonGreeks, blacks are different from whites, boys are 
different from girls, said Altmann. The more I 
hear about what GSO has done and what it plans 
to do, it has no relevance to me.
Altmann also says that from Student Senate, 
nobody has any idea where the money is going to 
come from. It would have to come from organiza
tions or from tax hikes, meaning suddenly, under
graduates are subsidizing graduates, said 
Altmann. ^
Chris Morrow, Funding & Recognition chair of 
Student Senate, proposed a resolution to raise the 
---------------------------- Undergraduate Ac
tivities Fee by $5 
every year for the 
next two years. The 
resolution was not 
seconded.
I encourage them 
to not waste any 
more time until 
someone presents 
them with a detailed plan of where the money 
comes from, and where the money is spent, said 
Altmann. He said that if they get the plan, Student 
Senate will need to sit and have a long discussion 
on it. Until then, he said, stop wasting time, so 
leave it on the table.
I dont have a problem with Student Senate 
tabling the resolution, as long as it comes up this 
semester, Mallo said. They should talk to their 
constituents. Im glad there is discussion. 
Wolfson said after serious consideration, she 
thinks GSO should now have 100 percent control of 
the Graduate Activities Fee.
She said, The [reconsideration] proves that Stu
dent Senate is undergraduate dominated, and it is 
not fair to graduate students.
Graduate students dont have time for this fight, 
said Wolfson. The fees should be controlled sepa
rately. Going through Student Senate was polite, 
but we will use other methods.
Something unwelcome will happen Tuesday, 
Wolfson said.
Role of computers 
in biology examined
SYMPOSIUM from page 3
drug is engineered specifically with the pur
pose of makinga specific protein either more or 
less active. It is only because of knowing the 
exact protein structure that this is possible.
Computational methods have almost unlim
ited applications. In addition to using them to 
study amino acids or cells,'they can also be 
used to map human genes on the chromo
somes. This would allow biologists to under
stand genetic disease and how to cure it. A 
more in-depth understanding of human genes 
might even allow biologists to understand hu
man evolution.
The Mellon College of Science has recently 
received several grants from the National Sci
ence Foundation and the Keck Foundation to 
support graduate students and post-doctor
ates financially, as well as to provide funds for 
more such research.
Taylor is very optimistic that Carnegie 
Mellons involvement in the field of computa
tional biology will possibly make Pittsburgh 
the center for the world of computational biol
ogy.

Shuttle merger would 
benefit universities
THE /AERQING OF CMU AND PlTT SHUTTLES
Recently, Carnegie Mellon has 
been reviewing proposals which, 
if adopted, would allow for the 
consolidation of our Shuttle/Es
cort service with various shuttle 
services of the University of 
Pittsburgh, Chatham College, 
Carlow College, and other area 
schools.
We think this is an excellent 
idea. All the institutions which 
would be involved in such a 
merger would only benefit from 
the combination of resources. 
Such a concentration of effort 
on an integrated shuttle system 
would allow for greater cover
age of multiple routes and elimi
nation of duplicated services.
The proposed integration 
could be the answer to one prob
lem which has plagued CMU 
students for years  the lack of 
a shuttle route into Squirrel Hill. 
Pitt, for example, runs regular 
shuttles through not only Oak
land and Shadyside, but through 
Squirrel Hill as well. On the 
other hand, CMUs shuttle cov
erage into Shadyside is slightly 
more comprehensive than, and 
would make a good complement 
to Pitts. If the status quo were 
to remain unchanged, dis
gruntled CMU students would 
continue to trudge out into the 
weather for a half hour walk, 
watching the Pitt shuttle splash
Occasionally, anewspaperwill 
print a piece, whether it be a 
column, editorial, or article, that 
someone disagrees with and 
would like to protest in some 
way. There are several ways to 
express dissatisfaction with a 
newspaper. In our opinion, some 
of these ways are valid and some 
are not.
One form of protest that we 
see as invalid is theft. Recently, 
there have been several inci
dents around the country where 
groups have stolen large 
amounts of newspapers. At the 
University of Pennsylvania, 
14,000 copies of the Daily Penn
sylvanian were stolen after a 
columnist criticized Martin 
Luther King, Jr. and affirma
tive action. AtPenn State, 6,000 
copies of the conservative pa
per, The Lionhearted, were sto
len after an editorial against a 
weekly feminist column.
Regardless of whether or not 
taking large quantities of news
papers in order to stop people 
from reading them is legal, pre
venting other people from read
ing a paper by takingit is wrong. 
Though such theft is not offi
cial government censorship, it 
is still a form of censorship and 
an infringement against peoples 
right to free speech.
One way to protest a papers 
content is to open a dialogue 
with the editors of the newspa
per by calling them up or set
ting up an appoinment. Usu
ally, editors are willing to dis
cuss their papers content and 
take steps to review it.
Another legitimate way to ex
press disagreement with some
thing which appeared in a news
paper is to write a letter to the
water at them as it zooms by 
from Squirrel Hill to Oakland.
Campus Police Chief Jim 
LaPaglia, whose department is 
responsible for Escort service, 
is relucant to endorse any of the 
several proposals. His argument 
seems to be that, for example, 
Pitt students would overwhelm 
CMU Shuttle service. We dis
agree. Why would Pitt students, 
who seem quite happy with their 
own shuttle service, suddenly 
switch en masse to using CMU 
Shuttle services exclusively? In 
fact, given a greater range of 
service, it seems to us that the 
pressure of overcrowding will 
more evenly distributed than it 
is currently.
We would urge forces both 
within university administra
tions and student government 
in all the schools involed with 
the proposals to seriously con
sider a merger. The benefits 
would be vast, and the conse
quences seemingly small. It 
would be a shame if such forward-thinking proposals were 
rejected solely on the basis of 
institutional xenophobia.
Pittsburgh, and, particularly 
Oakland, is a university-oriented community.
Its time that the universities 
involved start thinking that 
way.
editor. Almost all newspapers 
accept letters to the editor and 
most will even print letters with
out a signature. A letter to the 
editor will show the readers of 
the newspaper that you did not 
agree with something printed 
in the paper.
One other form of protest is to 
start a comp eting publication or 
use another existing publication 
as a vehicle for protest. Some
one could write a column in one 
newspaper protesting the ac
tions of another newspaper. Lo
cally, a group of conservative 
students from both the Univer
sity of Pittsburgh and CMU 
started The Phoenix because 
they felt their views could not 
be adequetely expressed in the 
current papers on campus. A 
similar situation arose several 
years ago, when the Student 
Union was founded to express 
views which its founders 
thought were lackingin the cam
pus publications of the time.
It is importnat to remember 
that stealing newspapers, or a 
similar form of protest is nei
ther fair nor justifiable. In fact, 
in many cases, it can be selfdefeating as, regardless of what 
is being protested, stealing 
newspapers cannot justified. If 
protestors encourage censoring 
of some newspapers, what is to 
stop another group from encour
aging censorship of those pro
testors?
We encourage constructive 
criticism, and, in fact, thrive on 
it.
Unless we know that people 
feel we are in error, we cannot 
take steps to rectify the situa
tion. If you disagree with us, 
please, let us know.
Tours program should 
not be dropped
Editor:
[Editors note:
This letter was 
originally ad
dressed to Erwin 
Steinberg, Vice Pro
vost.]
I am currently a student in the 
Carnegie Mellon Centre de Tours pro
gram, and I am writing to you [Erwin 
Steinberg] to protest your recent deci
sion to terminate the program at the 
end of this semester.
As the only student currently in the 
program who does not normally attend 
Carnegie Mellon University, I think that 
I bring a fresh perspective to the 
programs operation. And as a journal
ism student who covered Cornell 
Universitys administration for two 
years as one of the top reporters for the 
schools daily newspaper, I believe I 
also have a unique understanding ofthe 
inner workings of a universitys admin
istrative and budgetary restraints.
First, I would like to say that I do not 
think enough time has passed to make 
a fair and accurate assessment of the 
program. Two years is a very short time 
to judge the success of a program. One 
cannot expect a program to be known on 
campus, or throughout the United 
States, in such a short period. There are 
many study abroad programs in exist
ence whose success depends more on 
students from other universities than 
the host university attending. There 
was never truly a chance of this with the 
CMU in Tours program because it was 
not listed in the bible of study abroad 
programs, the Institute of International
Educations Academic Year Abroad, 
until just recently this year. This is the 
book that most university students re
fer to when choosing a program. I al
most chose not to attend this program 
because it was not yet listed in this 
book. Also, I dont think enough money 
was spent promoting through other 
schools study abroad offices. For ex
ample, at Cornell, there is a library full 
of brochures from almost every other 
program, but there were none for the 
CMU program. Additionally, other pro
grams often sent brochures to the lan
guage departments that were distrib
uted by the foreign language profes
sors.
Although there were many reasons 
why non-CMU students did not hear 
about or participate in the program, I 
have learned that there were also prob
lems with CMU student participation 
that had the program destined to fail 
from the start. For example, I have 
learned that some French professors 
recommended other programs over the 
Tours programs. Also, although the pro
gram brochures said it was planned for 
students of all majors, that was not 
really realistic at CMU. I have been told 
that many students advisors warned 
against study abroad, and that some 
departments did not easily accept credit 
from the program towards degree re
quirements. With these problems at the 
home campus, how could any adminis
trator have hope for the success of the 
Tours program?
Finally, I am aware that the programs 
main weakness was its cost. I do not 
know if many ways were examined to 
restrain or reduce costs before cancel
ing it. I would be happy to provide some 
suggestions for reducing the overhead;
there are many, if ydi only look care
fully. It is true, howe/er, that the cost 
would not disappear <ompletely. As an 
economics major yvoull tell you: it takes 
capital arid time to nake profit j or 
even break even. It ds not seem to me 
that CMU has invested enough time to 
reap the benefits thatare possible from 
this program.
These are just sone of the reasons 
Why this program was destined to fail. I 
think your decision vas rash and unfair 
to the dedicated staffand faculty here. I 
believe you should lave examined the 
reasons for the program's problems and 
tried to fix them fromPittsburgh, before 
canceling the progrun without warn
ing. From my experience at Cornell, I 
know that university administrators 
often form committees to examine the 
future of a program ike this, and the 
group will take an unvarranted time to 
reach a decision. But y>ur decision seems 
to be in the other dinction  much too 
abrupt without adeaiate thought and 
logical examination.
Finally, I want you;o know that I have 
written this letter if my own will  
without being urgedfrom program staff 
here or in Pittsburgh I do not know if it 
is possible for you to reconsider your 
decision, but I hopeyou do.
I think you personally have made an 
illogical decision thit is a grave injustice 
for Carnegie Melloi students and other 
students across th( United States. It is 
a shame that oth<r students will not 
have the opportunxy of a lifetime that I 
am currently haviig.

Society must accept responsibility
Recently, the movie The Program has been in the news as 
several people have been hurt, and one killed, while imitat
ing a scene from the movie. I havent seen the movie, just 
previews. The scene that people are literally dying to imitate 
has the actors lying down on a highway at night to show their 
courage. One of them actually reads a newspaper, comment
ing Ive always been good under pressure. Mere inches 
away, honking cars speed by.
In response to these tragedies, the makers of the movie 
made an unprecedented move. They pulled the current print 
of the movie and are rereleasing it without that scene. I have 
heard rumors that the parents of the deceased boy plan on 
suing.
Let me state that I wish the families of the injured and 
killed persons every condolence. Losing a relative is never 
easy. To lose someone close to such a meaningless death is 
especially tragic.
What I want to know is why they were on that road in the 
first place. Ive heard that alcohol was involved in some of 
these incidents. What are teenagers doing with alcohol in an 
unsupervised setting? At my high school graduation party 
there was alcohol, but we were chaperoned by the hosts 
parents. Where were the parents of these teenagers?
This question is more apropos than first appears. When I 
was younger I did some crazy things, some of which were 
damned stupid. But if someone had suggested that I lay out 
in the middle of a busy highway, Id have told them they were 
nuts. I had more common sense than that.
So why didnt these kids have that much common sense? 
Perhaps more importantly, why didnt they recognize that 
the movie is not real. Those were professional actors, in a
scripted stunt, with trained drivers the whole thing was 
fantasy! I used to watch The Three Stoqes. Theyd go at each 
other with power tools, poke eyes, etc. Jever in my life did I 
take a sander to someones head becauss Id seen Moe do that 
to Curly. I recognized that this was makebelieve, why couldnt 
these kids?
I believe that part of the answer wasthe thrill of the risk. 
These kids bet their lives for a thrill, aid lost. If the parents 
sue, I hope they lose. Our society has creied the myth that our 
lives should be risk-free. Its high time tiat people learn that 
their actions have consequences, and tha they are responsible 
for those consequences.
Liability suits have been a growing idustry over the past 
decade. People have been suing, and wnning, for the most 
inane reasons. Oftentimes its because hey didnt bother to 
think. Take the example of Stephanie \fyshington-Bey. She 
got a cup of hot tea from Hardees and turned her lip while 
driving. Instead of cursing and going on ler way, shes suing 
Hardees for $150,000 because they sold hr a defective and 
dangerous product. Of course tea is hot aid you run the risk 
of being burned.
There was a man fleeing police in a stcen car who hit a 
parked car and was injured. He sued the plice and the car 
owner and won $594,000. There was the buglar who, break
ing into a building, fell through a skylight ancbroke his leg. He 
sued and won because the skylight didnt hare a sign saying 
that you could fall through and injure yoursdf.
My last column [Pornography Censors Mis Big Picture, 
10/18] talked about how rapists could claim ;hat they were 
made to do it by porn. Recall that I said that rmrderers might 
use a similar argument that a movie made themdll? Nathaniel 
White, a convict out on parole, killed six wom-n. His excuse 
was the movie Robocop, I did exactly whatt seen in the 
movie, he said.

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  1 November 19937
I never thought Id hear myself say this, but after 
almost two months here in Tours, France, Im feeling 
rood and ready to go back to Pittsburgh. Twice-weekly 
general strikes and riots aside, nothing ever seems to 
lappenin France; and from what Ive read in The Tartan, 
3MU has become a veritable hotbed of political activity. 
3it-ins at the library! Microwaves in dorm rooms! The 
jebate in Student Senate rages on!
Naturally, news of this turmoil makes all of us here at 
fours wonder why we ever plotted, planned and gleefully 
anticipated a semester away from CMU in the first place, 
gut as long as were here, faced with the absence of

Europe. On the chance that anyone out there in Pitts
burgh is considering1 tearing themselves away from all 
the excitement long enough to spend a semester or even 
a few weeks abroad, I have compiled some handy travel 
tips Ive picked up along the way.
I should mention that like most Americans abroad for 
the first time, I initially relied on guidebooks for advice 
on travelbooks like The Best European Travel Tips, by 
John Whitman, who offers such insider-only informa[tion as: Trains can be a great way to get where you want 
to go, and Get a ncinsmoker seat if you dont smoke. 
While this is indeed stellar advice for anyone who has 
just returned from a centuries-long vacation from Planet 
Earth, the seasoned traveler knows that its the details 
that make or break the trip, little triflings such as: How 
do I fit in,with the French and not make a total ass out of 
myself? |

To succeed at this, one needs to follow only one cardinal barring train's from discriminating against the 
rule: Do not be grotesque and pathetic. Of course, as an respitorally challenged, threatening a law suit on

As an alumnus and father of a 
bright high school senior who was 
considering CMU as a potential

concerned. If this is how you 
honor diversity, I am appalled. 
It appears to be an early intro

I told my daughter that, to my 
regret, CMU and its administra

son of independent thought and 
would be better served to 
consider other schools.

Festival coverage 
was lacking
on
Letter to 
the Editor
Editor:
Consider
ing the nega
tive press 
that The Tar
tan gave the 
very first International Festival 
(Asia) I was pleasantly surprised 
to see a positive article about this 
years festival on Africa.
However, I was greatly disap
pointed in the very little press the 
festival got.
I know that the festival should 
have been a major feature article 
and that a lot more time should 
have been devoted to it by The 
Tartan staff.
Carnegie Mellon has finally 
started investing its money in 
something important for its stu
dent body  raising cultural 
awareness.
The student attendance at the 
festival was pretty apathetic, but 
not surprising considering the 
type of narrow-minded, self-cen
tered students we have at CMU.
The Tartan as a responsible 
newspaper should consider an im
portant part of its job assisting 
the administration in promoting 
such wonderful activities.
Considering The Tartans his
tory of cultural insensitivity and 
administration-bashing, Im not 
sure why Im surprised that there 
wasnt more of an emphasis on 
the International Festival in the
October 25 Tartan.
Aliya Kahan has done a superb 
job working on coordinating the 
festivals and she deserves a lot 
more credit that shes been given 
(by the campus as a whole).
Thanks for not giving up 
Aliyaand for continuing the 
struggle!
I hope that all the students on 
this campus, including The Tai*- 
tan staff, will finally begin to re
alize the importance of an event 
such as the International Festi
val for bringing Carnegie Mellon 
to the forefront of the 21st cen
tury.
Upon understanding the im
portance, I hope that they will 
get involved by participating in 
it.
College is supposed to be a time 
of expanding the mind, not 
making it more narrow.
On a final note, I would person
ally like to thank Kahan for mak
ing a significant contribution to 
this campus and I shall surely 
miss her energetic spark and con
fident spirit in putting together 
the festival when she leaves.
I hope to see the festival be
come a loved and respected tradi
tion at Carnegie Mellon Univer
sity, parallel to and beyond the 
respect given to Spring Carnival.

Bloodlust runs rampant
Hunters out of control in Fox Chapel
Matt Ball
Wanted: Bambi. Crime: Nib
bling flowers. Sentence: Death 
by arrows.
At this moment, somewhere 
in the wealthy andusually quiet 
boro of Fox Chapel, a hired 
killer is hiding in a tree waiting 
for a male deer to walk within 
range of his weapon. This hunt, 
which started on Mahatma 
Gandhis birthday, October 2, 
and will run for six weeks, has 
received a great deal of atten
tion, even making National 
Public Radio.
The main rationale for the 
hunt is that the deer are com
ing into the meticulously mani
cured yards and munching on 
flowers and shrubbery. The con
cern of the residents is under
standable to an extent, but it is 
hard to find cause for condemn
ing these beautiful and other
wise harmless animals to death.
But this is exactly what has 
been done. In an alleged at
tempt to rid themselves of the 
pests, the boro residents de
cided to pursue, a permit for 
bow hunting and open the area 
to hunters. These sportsmen 
go into the woods (hidden, so as 
to be out of sight of sensitive 
eyes), erect a platform in a tree 
along a deer path, and shoot 
(silently, so as to not offend
sensitive ears) at any of the 
animals who come near.
This is far from a thoughtful, 
compassionate, or ethical so
lution. Concern for some color
ful but hardly sentient plants 
is not reason to murder a 
healthy, feeling being who ac
tively desires to live and who 
will most likely not die in
stantly from an arrow wound, 
but rather suffer and bleed to 
death. Relocation or birth con
trol are unfeasible, but a hid
den and silent slaughter is ac
ceptable.
A more palatable excuse for 
the killing has been mentioned 
by some involved in the de
bate. These people point to the 
fact that the deer have been 
eating new growth in the.sur
rounding woods, which upsets 
the balance of the local ecol

cured and then focus on the other. It takes a great get done overseas. In Somalia, the original huFor many years now, America has seen its 
military as one of its strongest assets and has 
rarely fled from the opportunity to use this asset 
to bring democracy to countries around the world. 
Many times, its missions have been successful, 
but unfortunately often accomplish nothing ex
cept the death of young Americans and the 
growth in animosity around the world against 
America.
One reason for the success and failures of the 
American military in foreign endeavors has been 
the preoccupation of the President with domes
tic issues even when important events are occur
ring abroad. Take Lyndon Johnson, for example. 
Throughout his administration, Johnson focused 
on his Great Society programs and having them 
implemented, while a small conflict in Vietnam 
escalated into an{ all-out war, resulting in the 
death of many Americans. On the other hand, 
there was George Bush. Bush focused mainly on 
the foreign issues. He foiled the Iraqi attempt at 
conquering the Arabian Peninsula and was able 
to go into Panam and restore a proper govern
ment there. Bush had these successes without 
doing much on the domestic scene.
Although I did support Bush in his re-election 
attempt, I must admit that he really was not in 
tune with the domestic needs'of the country. But 
from these two examples, its obvious that a 
President who is} trying to do too many things 
may only be as successful as one who is only 
handling affairs in one area.
Obviously, the best situation is to strike a 
balance between the two. Not a balance in that
deal of skill to determine which should take preceRonak Singhal dence, and often, some luck is necessary. However, 
it seems that President Bill Clinton has no skill at 
handling both foreign and domestic issues at the 
same time and has allowed all his luck to pass him 
by without making good use of it.
Clinton was elected on a platform that was al
most solely based on domestic issues. He was 
rightly
criticized 
during the 
election 
c a m - 
paign for 
having no 
thoughts 
about con
ducting for
eign policy. ^
At the time
of the election, there really were no hot-spots in 
the world and the eyes of the nation were focused 
inward.
In his campaign, Clinton promised to reform 
welfare, health care, and just about every other 
program he could think of. This appealed to many 
in the electorate who were tired of domestic affairs 
being neglected. But as Clinton took office, the 
foreign issues began to creep into the limelight. 
First, there was the handling of the American 
troops that were already in Somalia. Then, there 
was the historic peace agreement between Israel 
and the PLO. And finally, there is the debacle in 
Haiti. All this time, he was also trying to pass the 
largest tax-increase in history, trying to pass 
NAFTA, and trying to find support for his health 
care plan.
manitarian mission turned into a bounty hunt for 
the warlord, Mohammed Aidid Farah, and now 
there really seems to be no general consensus 
about what our troops are doing there. Are we 
going to restore a government? If so, are we going 
to force democracy upon the nation and then stay 
to monitor elections. Clinton has vowed to remove 
the troops by the end of next March. But his
promises
It would be nice if Clinton took an issue 
and stuck to it until he reached his goal. 
The man is trying to do too many things at 
once, and in the end is getting absolutely 
nothing done.
must be 
taken 
lightly. 
Just re
member 
that this 
is the 
same 
man who 
promised 
to give the
middle class a tax cut and not raise the gas tax, and 
instead raised the gas tax and taxes on the middle 
class.
Somalia is by no means Clintons only headache. 
He has American troops in Haiti being told to go 
home by Haitians, who say that they will turn this 
into another Somalia. First, it bodes very badly 
for a President when foreigners start criticizing 
our foreign policy, especially foreigners that we 
think were helping by showing up. Clinton says 
that the troops will stay until the proper govern
ment is installed. But new reports show that what 
is the proper government may actually be led by a 
person with a history of mental instabilities.
All the while, Clinton has been stumped by his 
big domestic plans. First, he was able to pass his 
budget bill by the slimmest of margins by promis
ing senators and representatives just about ev
erything under the sun, from town meetings 
about welfare reform to promises to make 
more cuts later on down the road. Now, he is 
trying to get the votes necessary to pass NAFTA, 
while also trying to gain support for health care 
plan.
What can save Clintons presidency from the 
fate of presidents like Jimmy Carter? It would be 
nice if Clinton took an issue and stuck to it until 
he reached his goal. The man is trying to do too 
many things at once, and in the end is getting 
absolutely nothing done. Clinton should tell the 
American people what our goals are in Somalia,,, 
and Haiti. He needs to justify our presence and1 
explain his plan for removing our troops. The 
memory of Vietnam still lingers for many, and 
the longer these situations continue, the more 
support for the President will continue to weaken.
Clintons presidency has been marked by an 
attempt to accomplish everything, while in real
ity the administration is accomplishing nothing. 
America should not be the worlds policeman, 
nor should it become isolationist in nature, but 
it must find the correct balance between the two. 
The same is true at home, where Clinton needs 
to start prioritizing his ideas so that in the end 
he actually does get something accomplished for 
the good of the American people.
Then again, maybe its better for America that 
Clinton has been unable to accomplish any
thing. Whichever is the case, if he wishes to save 
his presidency, it is time that he finds the bal
ance between domestic and foreign and between 
each specific domestic issue, otherwise he could 
be on the same road that George Bush took; the 
road that goes only one-way  away from the 
White House.

Unlike almost every other in

the legal costs of the defendant if

Often the defendant will settle 
to stop the lawsuit, because its 
cheaper than defending. If the

tegrity of their flower beds. This monster has 
done far more damage than any herd of deer or 
other natural occurrence in the area. Beyond the 
irreparable ruin already wrought, much more is 
being devised.
This devil of destruction is development, which 
doesnt merely nibble but rather steamrolls any
thing and everything in its path. Trees, flowers, 
deer, and squirrels all fall before its unstoppable 
march and unquenchable hunger for more.
By some twisted logic, we exterminate all natu
ral predators who feed on the sick and weak of a 
herd, while encroaching further and further into 
the homes of these deer; then we cry for their 
slaughter in the name of ecological balance. Death
and destruction are the accepted and to many the 
only conceivable solution.
A closer look reveals the true nature of the 
minds behind this hunt. The permit granted is to 
kill male deer only. Numerous studies have shown 
that does, by some mechanism, have more mul
tiple births when the ratio of females to males 
increases.
Therefore the carnage being wrought is not 
intended to control the deer population. Rather, 
it is another way to satisfy the insatiable bloodlust 
of so many of us.

Beware of international embarrassment
TRAVEL, from page 7
catch a metro to a train to Swit
zerland. My first mistake was 
being a New Yorker, because 
') when I glimpsed a faraway metro 
ready to leave the station I in
stinctively sprinted ahead, made 
a mad dash for the doors, and 
managed to hurl my body into the 
car just as the doors slammed 
} shut behind me. Unfortunately, I 
had forgotten that I was wearing 
a backpack approximately the 
size and shape of Rhode Island; 
that this pack protruded out hori
zontally from my back for sev\ eral, solid-packed inches (okay, 
maybe the hair dryer and pedi
cure kit were a little excessive); 
and that I had a traveling com
panion, as in a person who actu
ally wanted to take this trip with 
i me, who was still standing bewil
dered on the platform behind.
These three facts became all 
too apparent as the doors clamped 
together firmly on the overstuffed 
hunk of luggage to which my body 
\1 was securely attached. The doors 
would neither open or shut; the 
train couldnt leave until the doors 
were closed. I was trapped in the 
door of the Metro like a big dumb 
American dweeb. Now, a true 
 Parisian in this predicament 
might mutter a muted, Zut 
alors, and stare down a gawking 
tourist as he waited for the doors 
to open. Amy and I chose an alter
nate approach responding to the 
situation with all the finesse and 
subtlety of a George Bush BozoOzone campaign maneuver. I 
began to shriek, in English, to 
the car full of bored, slightly an
noyed Parisians: IM STUCK!
IM STUCK! Amy, who inciden
tally hadhad the presence of mind 
to carry with her that day a huge 
plastic bag full of green apples, 
clutched the apples in one hand 
and pounded on my backpack 
with the other, shouting: ABBY!
GET OUT! GET OFF THE 
TRAIN!
Up to this point, our display 
could have been passed off as free 
entertainment, at least for those 
passengers who had left their 
tastefully-decorated Parisian 
apartments that morning want
ing to see two idiots modern-day 
dramatization of the last helicop

ticular metro car, that most of 
them would have sooner ap
plauded Belgian troops march

pulled out of the station, leaving 
Amy behind, she began running 
alongside it, flailing both her bag 
of apples and her arms as she 
screamed that she didnt know 
which stop to get off at when she 
took the next train. Ever helpful, 
I volunteered GARE-DELYOOOOON! at a decibel that 
would shatter glass. Its probably 
still echoing in th metro tunnels 
right now, a permanent reminder 
to Parisians that they should re
ally get around to toughening up 
border restrictions or maybe just 
erect a fortified wall around the 
city.
The point, future travelers, is 
that when I finally turned around 
(only narrowly avoiding knock
ing a family of four into the next 
dimension with my backpack), I 
met the collective gaze of a car 
full of Parisians who were, shall

CMU soccer programs finish record season
Womens team ends 13-4-1, best finish ever
Sophomore midfielder Nicole Poisson controls the ball against the University of 
Chicago at Gesling Stadium. Poisson finished second on the team in scoring this year.

Junior forward Christina Isaly second half goal was the difference in Saturday's game.
By LUBOMIR W. KOCHANSKYJ
Tartan Sports Editor
On Saturday, the womens soccer team 
ended their successful season at 
Carnegie Mellon. A well-deserved 1-0 
victory over the University of Chicago 
Maroons helped the Tartans post a 13- 
4r-1 (2-4 UAA) record.
On a miserable day, drenched with 
rain and snow, and chilled by near freez
ing temperatures, the Tartans took the 
field at Gesling Stadium.
With the opening kickoff, it became 
obvious that the slippery turf and slick 
ball would make play unpredictable. 
Head coach Julie Shackford had no 
trouble recognizing this problem.
It was difficult to play a possession 
type game because of the rain, and the 
ball was moving so fast. At first, we just 
tried to knock the ball around and it 
wasnt going to work on this field be
cause it was so slippery and everyones 
touch was off.
The Tartans had a reasonable number 
of chances to score in the first half but 
could not capitalize.
I dont think we took as many shots as 
we needed to, said Shackford.
A number of Tartan shots went wide of 
the net, which could be blamed on the 
wet ball and slippery turf.
Keeping the ball in play and challeng
ing the goalie to handle more shots would 
have taken advantage of the conditions.
A number of Chicagos shots were on 
goal, but none had much behind them, 
so freshman goalie Jill Weber handled 
them easily.
The first half ended tied at zero. 
Shackford talked to her team at halftime and decided to change her strategy 
somewhat.
We decided to play longer bails and 
diagonal balls to try to catch Chicago off 
guard. I think that was probably more 
effective, said Shackford.
The second half started off slowly, 
with both teams trading possession of 
the ball. Ten minutes in, CMU set up a 
number of incredible scoring chances, 
only to come away empty thanks to the 
weather.
Approximately two minutes after this 
barrage of offense, freshman midfielder 
Mae Hogan was injured after being 
knocked to the ground by a Chicago 
player.
I dont think it was a dirty foul. Defi
nitely a foul but not malicious or any
thing like that. Mae said she didnt have 
any feeling. We think it is a concussion, 
said Shackford.
Hogan fell awkwardly to the turf after 
being checked by a Chicago defender 
and hit her head and shoulder on the 
ground.
She was transported to Presbyterian 
Hospital for observation and was diag
nosed with mild head trauma and not a 
concussion.
Soon after returning to the playing 
field, junior forward Christina Isaly 
kicked in a shot past the fallen Chicago 
goalkeeper to put the Tartans up 1-0.
The Tartans could not relax because 
there was still 26 minutes left in the 
game. So they continued to attack the 
ball and keep it in Chicagos end of the 
field.
When asked if Shackford was worried 
if the team would go into a defensive 
shell to protect the one goal lead, she 
responded quickly.
We are at a point in the season where 
we are fit enough. They can be aggres
sive like that, she said. If anything, I
was probably being a little conservative, , 
not sending everyone through the ball.
Chicago was still able to get off some 
close range shots, but Weber denied them 
every time.
On one chance, Chicago midfielder 
Katie Shulte, the teams leading scorer 
came down the field on a breakaway. At: 
point blank range, Shulte blasted a shot; 
to Webers right. Fully extended, Weber , 
dove to her right to make the save.'Thatwas incredible, said Shackford, react?, 
ing to the save.
Senior back Anh Nguyen played  
strong game at the defense. In the lasfr
10 minutes, she broke up a two on one 
opportunity that looked like a sure goal 
and then took the ball away from Shulte.
Shackford was pleased with Nguyen 
and the rest of the Tartan defense.
In the last five minutes our defense 
held. We had some good clearances and. 
Jill Weber made a couple of fantasticsaves.
Isaly ended the season as the Tartans^ 
leading scorer with 19 points (eight goafep 
three assists). Sophomore midfielder^ 
Nicole Poisson was second with l8 points* 
(seven goals, four assists). Freshman^ 
mid fielder Alyssa Newman was third 
with 15 points (seven goals, one assist).' 
Weber finished with 8.5 shutouts (she, 
shared some with freshman goalie 
Katharine Morrison), giving up about 
one goal per contest.
Winning against UAA opponents Chi
cago and the University of Washington > 
at St. Louis, and earning a school record 
winning season means a lot to Shackford^
It was a great win. Obviously it is 
good way to end the season, but it also 
a catapult for the off season. It sure is 
nice to end on a positive. I dont think?1; 
anybody anticipated this success.
Despite record-breaking season, Tartan men fall short of NCAA playoff berth;
By ERIC STRAUSS
Tartan Assistant Sports Editor
Although the 1993 season was a good one for the 
CMU mens soccer team, it ended in disappoint
ment once again, as the Tartans came up just short 
in their bid for their first-ever NCAA playoff berth. 
When the NCAA announced its bracket for the 
Division III mens soccer tournament, the four 
teams in the Mid-Atlantic region did not include 
CMU.
Its disappointing, but what are you going to 
do? said head coach Nick Gaudioso. We come so 
close, and I thought we were definitely in, to tell 
you the truth. Thats the way it goes. I guess well 
just have to wait until next year.
The four teams that qualified from the region

Junior forward Alex Amezquita takes the header.
were top-seeded Elizabethtown, which went 20-2-
0 on the year; second-seeded Gettysburg (15-11); 
third seed Messiah, at 12-6-2; and fourth-seeded 
Scranton at 15-5-1.
The playoff brackets were announced on a con
ference call from the NCAA headquarters in Kan
sas City, Missouri, and no results other than the 
brackets were available. The Tartans, who were 
third in the region a week ago, were most likely the 
fifth-ranked team, dropping behind Scranton and 
Messiah in the rankings.
When you come so close  with other teams 
having six losses  they look at your opponents, 
Gaudioso said.
What can you 
tell [from 
Scranton and 
Messiahs 
records]? We 
got so close ...
When you look 
at opponents 
you dont like, 
we didnt lose to 
any of [those 
kind of teams].
I figured we did 
okay. Its a com
mittee, and we 
dont play that 
many teams in 
their region [of 
the state]. Well 
try to find out more tomorrow. Right now things 
are fairly sketchy.
The Tartans were also fifth in the region last 
year, when they posted a 12-4^-l record.
Two of the Tartans UAA foes, the league cham
pion University of Rochester, at 10-2-4, and Wash
ington University of St. Louis (12-5-1)  who the 
Tartans easily defeated during the season  both 
qualified for the tournament from different re
gions. Rochester, the fourth seed from the North
east region, earned an automatic berth, while 
Washington qualified third in the South-Central 
region.
Gaudioso speculated that had the Tartans tied

CMU senior midfielder Min Chong watches.Chicago goalie Jon Novy.
Rochester [they lost 1-0 in double-overtime], they 
would have gotten the automatic berth. He thought 
the team was tied for second in the league, but was 
not sure whether they tied Washington, or were 
behind them in third.
This was a disappointing end for a team which 
set the school record for wins, tallying their 13th 
in a 3-0 victory over the University of Chicago
11 last game of the season.
CMU ended 
the regular 
season with a 
13-3-1 record 
(5-2-0 in *:lte 
. UAA) after t,he 
win over Chi
cago and a 31 
loss to Bethany 
College this 
week.
To make the 
playoffs was 
our goal at the 
beginning of 
the season, 
said graduate 
student de
fender and co
captain John Stivoric after the win over Chicago, 
but before the playoff announcement.
Stivoric had expressed doubts when he spoke 
about the playoffs, saying he did not enjoy relying 
on the selection committee. Although he was opti
mistic at the time, he concluded by saying I just 
wish it didnt have to be decided by the NCAA. Two 
losses, youre in like nothing.
Against Chicago, the Tartans dominated on the 
field and on the scoreboard. Freshman midfielder 
Tommy Layton, back in action after missing 10 
games due to a knee injury, scored twice, and 
junior forward Alex Amezquita picked up the Tar
tans third goal.

This game, we controlled, said Gaudioso. Most 
everything was on for us.
Although Chicago goalkeeper Jon Novy made 
several nice saves, he could not hold off the Tartan ; 
attack.
The team finally broke through the Maroons; 
defense in the 13th minute, when senior midfielder \ 
Min Chong booted a long lead pass to Amezquita, I 
who crossed the ball to Layton, whose shot hit the ! 
bottom of the crossbar and ricocheted in for a 1-0 
CMU lead.
Another nice pass by Chong set up Amezquitas  
goal. Chong dribbled the ball towards Novy, faked ; 
him out, and passed across the penalty area to ! 
Amezquita, who beat the out-of-position goalie j 
with a low shot for a 2-0 edge.
Layton sealed the game with two minutes left in I 
the first half when he banged in a shot from about 
12 yards out.

Tartans leave Wolverines howling after 48-7 drubbing
By RICH KWIATKOWSKI
Tartan Staffwriter
The Tartans conquered the snow and wind and rolled past the 
Grove City Wolverines 48-7. The win improves Carnegie Mellons 
record to 6-2. Their UAA record remains at 3-0. The Tartans 
manhandled the Wolverines both on offense and defense. The of
fense charged for 526 total yards, while the defense held Grove City 
to only 46 total yards. After the first half Grove City had only two 
yards total offense.
Carnegie Mellon entered the game ranked seventh in the south 
reginal polls. The big win helps their chances to crack the top four, 
but playoff hopes still seem doubtful. Only the top four teams in each 
region compete in the NCAA Division III playoffs.
The Tartans received the ball first and attacked the Wolverine
defense with a relentless running plan. Junior halfback Jason 
Grusky, senior fullback Brian Horton, and sophomore halfback 
Mike Mathias moved the ball on the ground until the drive stalled on 
the Grove City 14 yardline. The Tartan offense held the ball for six 
minutes on their first drive but could not move the ball into the 
endzone. Senior placekicker Fred Harding attempted a 32-yard field 
goal, but a stiff wind kept the ball short of the uprights.
Grove City took over but had no chance to advance the ball after 
a crushing sack by senior noseguard Jon Hutchinson. The Wolver
ines were forced to punt from their own endzone. The punt took a 
Grove City bounce and pushed the ball back to the CMU 37 yardline.
The Tartans were able to open the passing game because of the 
success of the running game. Junior quarterback Chris Dee com
pleted two passes this drive. The first was a 22-yard over the middle 
pass to sophomore tight end Aaron Neal. The second was a 26-yard
touchdown pass to Grusky. Harding added the extra point and the J 
Tartans were on top 7-0.
Dee had another career day. He completed 11 of 21 passes with no , 
interceptions; three passes were for touchdowns. He threw for 187 
yards and rushed for 34 yards. These numbers are made more , 
impressive considering the snow, wind and rain the Tartans played 
in.
I didnt think about the conditions. The ball wasnt slick, but it 
was cold. We came out and ran straight ahead and were able to 
overpower them. We were able to do anything we wanted, we were ; 
just limited by the field, said Dee.
I was amazed how well Chris threw the ball considering the 
conditions, said head coach Rich Lackner. We dealt with the 
elements better [than Grove City], you can not let it bother you. !

12The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  1 November 1993
Tartans rout Grove City for sixth victory
FOOTBALL, from page 11
Our opponent was playing in the same 
conditions, we only fumbled once. The 
conditions affected their play more than 
ours.
(The Tartans took control once more at 
the beginning of the second quarter af
ter a trade of punts by the two teams. 
The Tartans received excellent field po
sition at the Grove City 35 yardline and 
needed only five plays for their second 
Score. Dee completed a 16-yard touch
down pass to Grusky. With the success
ful, extra point the Tartans increased 
their lead to 14-0.
-Grove City took over on their 11 
yardline after the kickoff but was forced 
tO'punt after three plays. CMU moved 
the ball well on the ensuing drive to the 
Wolverine 19 yardline. The Tartans de
cided to attempt a first down on fourth 
and eight, but Dees pass fell short. Grove 
City could only the move the ball a total 
of 10 yards, fueled by a sack by senior 
defensive back Jerry Fuller for a 13- 
yard loss.
-'Grove City punted and junior defen
sive back and punt returner Joe Ferris 
returned the ball 48 yards for a touch
down. The play, however, was called
back because of a personal foul call 
against CMU. The ball was returned to 
Grove City on a strange call, since the 
personal foul had occured before the 
punt.
The penalty just delayed an inevitable 
conclusion. Wolverine senior quarter
back George Fichter was intercepted by 
senior inside linebacker Jeff Blue. The 
Tartan offense took over, and on the 
second play Dee hit senior wide receiver 
Andy Van Sprang for a 34-yard touch
down pass. The Tartans now had a 21
0 lead.
Grove City took control with 55 sec
onds left in the half. On third and 11 
Fichter was chased out of the pocket and 
hit by Blue, who knocked the ball loose. 
The fumble was recovered by Ferris and 
the CMU offense took over on the Grove 
City 34 yardline with 37 seconds left. 
Mathias rushed for 18 yards on the first 
play, but the Tartans could not gain any 
more yards. On fourth down and 10, 
Harding entered for his second field goal 
attempt. The 33-yard attempt was 
blocked and brought the half to an end.
Grove City received the second half 
opening kickoff. The Wolverines moved 
the ball considerably better than in the
first half, but the Tartan defense still 
proved too tough for the Wolverines. The 
teams traded punts when the Tartans 
took over with excellent field position 
again on the Grove City 46 yardline.
The offense moved the ball on the 
ground with Horton and in the air to 
Neal and Siket. Horton rushed for 94 
yards on 17 attempts. Neal was Dees 
favorite target. He caught four passes 
for 28 yards. Siket caught three passes 
for 91 yards.
The Tartans fourth touchdown came 
on a two yard Horton rush, and the 
Tartans were rolling with a 28-0 lead.
Grove Citys only score came on an 85- 
yard kickoff return by sophomore 
tailback John Kollinger. The extra point 
was good and the shutout was over.
The slight momentum Grove City got 
from the score was trampled by the Tar
tans fifth touchdown. Junior quarter
back Matt Neiss checked in for some 
valuable playing time. Neiss and the 
offense took over on their own 19 yardline 
and marched 81 yards for a score. Neiss 
fired a perfect pass over the Wolverine 
coverage to Siket, who completed the 43- 
yard play for a touchdown. The Tartans 
tried a fake point after kick, but Neisss
pass fell short.
Im happy the coaches went with me. 
It was a critical point in the game after 
[Grove City] returned the ball for a touch
down, said Neiss. The line did a great 
job and the momentum switched after 
one play.
The Tartans scored twice in the fourth 
quarter. The first score came on Hortons 
second touchdown, a four yard touch
down rush. The second score was set up 
by an interception by Fuller in the 
endzone for a touchback. The Tartans 
took over on their 20 yardline.
The second offensive line entered the 
game and looked impressive, marching 
the ball 80 yards. The Tartans used 
sophomore fullback David Saylor, jun
ior halfback Nick Bush, sophomore wide 
receiver Tony Babeo, sophomore full
back Lee Anton, and senior tight end 
Mike Shirey and all contributed to the 
fourth quarter scoring drives. The sec
ond fourth quarter touchdown was a 
one-yard quarterback sneak by Neiss to 
give the game its final score 48-7.
Also contributing to the Tartan attack 
were sophomore quarterback Keith 
Dickerson and freshman halfback Scott 
Cowan.
The Tartan defense was>as much responsible for the win as the offense. The 
defense gave the offense excellent field 
position and halted several Grove City 
surges. The defense sacked Wolverine 
quarterbacks eight times for a loss of4i..' 
yards, gave up only 17 net rushing yards  
and 29 net passing yards. Sophomore 
inside linebacker Mark Kasperowicz led 
the defense with six tackles, Blue had 
five tackles, and senior inside linebacker 
Chad Wilson contributed with four tack
les.
The offense and defense played a hard 
and tough game. We were very aggres
sive and played with enthusiasm. We 
kept our mistakes to a minimum except 
on special teams. I was disappointed 
with the special teams, a blocked field 
goal, penalties and the return for a touch
down. I was glad to see that a lot of the 
players got in and got valuable playing 
time, said Lackner.
The Tartans return home for their 
final two games. The Tartans play host 
to the Catholic University Cardinals on 
November 6 for a 7 pm kickoff. CMU 
closes out the season on November 13 
when they battle the Case Western University Spartans in a UAA matchup.
Ruggers beat Fairmount State
By JUSTIN LAM
Tartan Junior Staff writer
Carnegie Mellons rugby team continued their 
strong trend of playing by defeating Fairmount 
State College (FSC) 17-0 last week. CMU has now 
outscored its last three opponents by a combined 
score of 5210.
; The Tartans got the jump on FSC by scoring 
quickly. With the timeliest of assistance from jun
ior. captain John Crowley, senior Shugie Proctor 
scored a try. Freshman Larry Adams converted 
successfully on the kick afterward, making the 
score 7-0.
CMU continued to dominate the first half with 
excellent defense. FSC spent less than five min
utes within CMU territory during the 40 minute
half. Proctor was able to score again, making the 
score 12-0.
The play of the second half was a continuation of 
the first, and CMLPs defense proved to be impen
etrable. Senior Andy Flores was able to seal the 
victory on the game with another try, making the 
score 17-0.
CMU has improved upon their performance from 
the last two victories, with excellent forward play. 
Tackling and first and second phase play we^e 
noticeably better than the last two weeks, with the 
CMU scrum winning more rucks, mauls, hooks, 
and line-outs.
This weeks victory raises the CMU record to 4-
2. The next match has been scheduled against 
Wheeling Jesuit College on November 6 here at 
Carnegie Mellon.
Hockey debuts with 7-4 win

two weeks ago, picking up a 7-
4 win over Community Col
lege of Allegheny County 
(CCAC) in the season opener, 
before falling to Slippery Rock 
University of Pennsylvania 
this past Saturday, 5-4.
In the game against CCAC, 
freshman defenseman Chris 
Adukaitis scoredtwo goals and 
picked up an assist to lead the 
team to victory. Graduate stu
dent defenseman Tom Sullivan, 
senior left wing Mike Gallin, 
sophomore center Roger Madd
alena, junior forward John 
Cardillo, and graduate student 
and team captain Dave Umland 
each tallied his first goal of the 
season.
The Tartans jumped out to 
leads of 3-0 and 5-1 before hold
ing off a CCAC comeback.
Against Slippery Rock, it was 
the Tartans turn to come from 
behind. A late rally pulled the 
team from 3-0 down to 5-4, but 
the team cotdd not post the tying
Freshman Jim Buck, 
Umland, and junior Phil Beck

Blue Jays win series thanks to their Dominican Republicans
Baseball with Andy
ch aneh TOeneinning
Hmmm...Aboutthat open border thing 
with Canada.... Well, the Jays took the 
World Series again, and Canadian base
ball fans are once again rejoicing in a 
jiuge show of nationalism over the tri
umph of a team of players imported, 
mostly from the Dominican Republic to
play a foreign game. No, I am not bitter!
I mean just because Cal Ripken is even 
from the same state as the team that he 
plays forbut thats-not what Im here 
to talk about.
Coming into the series the underdogs, 
Philadelphia came just looking to have a 
good time; its probably a good thing that 
they were. The Phillies season-long 
strategy of playing well enough to beat 
the opposition just couldnt hold out 
against Torontos onslaught. It wasnt a 
complete blowout, however; both teams 
had their share of time in the spotlight. 
And they both had a few outstanding 
players.
Paul Molitor gave new meaning to the 
phrase created in Gods image during
the World Series this ye'ar. Ending up 
with a .500 batting average, eight RBIs, 
and two home runs, triples, and doubles, 
Molitor was the obvious choice for MVP. 
Im sure that neither Torontos firstbaseman John Olerud nor thirdbaseman Ed Sprague regret their time 
spent on the bench during the games in 
Philadelphia, when manager Cito 
Gaston had to juggle his line up to allow 
Molitors mighty bat to get to the plate 
due to the lack of a designated hitter 
rule in the National League.
Blue Jays outfielder Joe Carter was 
also a happy camper coming away as the 
second player in history to win the World 
Series with a home run. Carters threerun shot off of Philadelphias Mitch Wil
liams came with one out in the ninth 
inning to give the Jays the game by a 
score of 8-6. Carter was also the offi
cially the heaviest player on the field 
this year, but I really have a hard time 
believing that John Big Boy Kruk, who 
makes dents in the astro-turf at the 
Phillies first-base, didnt lie about his 
weight of 215 pounds.
Phillies outfielder Lenny Dykstra also 
looked pretty good, hitting four home 
runs in the series, two in game four 
which the Phillies lost to the J ays 15-14. 
Dykstra also played well defensively, 
making two key catches in game two to 
keep the lead. Then to top of his fielding, 
he hit a solo homer in the seventh to 
bring the Phillies lead to 6-3.
And Philadelphia pitcher Curt 
Schilling showed everyone why he was 
made the National League MVP from ^ 
the playoffs without even winning a 
game. Schilling pitched nine innings of 
shutout ball against the Toronto line-up 
in game 5 and picked up a 2-0 win for the 
Phillies, bringing them 3-2 on the se
ries.
Overall, the Jays played well; they 
actually deserved the Championship, as 
bad as that tastes for me to say. I just 
wish they would have taken the series to 
its full, seven-game length. I was enjoy
ing those Energizer Bunny commercials.

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  1 November 1993
fould you believe Pittsburgh vs. Cleveland in the World Series?
The Suicide Squeeze
by Anuj Gupta
f And the winner of the 1995 World 
!ceries is the Cleveland Indians, in seven 
lames over the Pittsburgh Pirates. 
Y0ure a funny guy Anuj, you are thinklg. Well, although this may a bit of an 
eration, it is not too far from the 
nth. The Pirates and Indians have 
iegun to lay the groundwork for what 
fould be two of the future powerhouses 
! baseball.
I want to first focus on the hometown 
joys, the beloved Bucs. After winning 
hree straight National League East 
[ties and missing the World Series by 
ne out, the Bucs fell this year to a 
ecord of 75-87. Most may look at this 
ecord and basically count out the Bucs 
or the next few years. What many dont 
ealize is that this record was achieved 
nth a record thirteen rookies on the 
quad, and these rookies basically played 
500 ball till the All Star break, when 
heir lack of experience finally caught 
up with them.
The pluses for the Pirates start in thd 
lugout with Jim Leyland. After recordng the best overall record in baspoall 
iver the previous three years, Ley&nds 
sffort in 1993 was the finest of his ca
reer. He was able to combine mmy play
ers who previously had no* played a 
xame in the majors, with the few veter
ans left over from the rfiampionship 
years, and earn the respect of all, while 
till leading tlie team to a respectable 
record.
Secondly, oiie has to realize that the 
Pirates have an established player or 
star in the makingat all eight everyday 
positions. At third base is Jeff King who
finally blossomed in 1993 with 98 RBIs, 
and put an end to all the doubts as to 
whether he would ever attain his first 
round pick potential.
Meanwhile, Jay Bell has established 
himself as one of the best shortstops in 
baseball both ofensively and defensively. 
In center, the Pirates have one of the 
icons of Pittsburgh sports with Andy 
Van Slyke. Although his back continues 
to ail him, he should have at least an
other two or three good years left. In
left field roams A1 Martin, the man who 
hit the most home runs and most RBIs 
for a Pirates rookie since Ralph Kiner in 
the 60s.
The catcher continues co be the stal
wart, Don Slaught, who passed up the 
possibility of big bucks this off season by 
signing a long term contract with the 
Bucs, for he knew that something good 
was in the air with this team.
At first base thePirates have a variety 
of options. The first one starts with Kevin 
Young, who was my pick for the 1993 
Rookie of the Year. Obviously he didnt 
have that kind of a year, but he did play 
stellar defense and managed to come on 
strong offensively at the end of the year, 
finishing with 47 RBIs. Young was a 
consistent offensive force in the minors 
andflrith a little more experience should 
show great improvement on this years 
cifensive numbers. If the Pirates choose 
not to go with Young, they can go with 
this years surprise .300 hitter Orlando 
Merced, if they dont trade him first, or 
they could play Rich Aude who was called 
up in September and showed some brief 
glimpses of what he could do with a bat.
In right field at some point of the 
season next year will be a man projected 
as one of the future stars of the National 
League. Midre Cummings, who was ob
tained from the Twins in the John Smiley 
deal, is a complete package, with speed, 
power, high batting average, and stellar 
defense. He just needs a chance to get 
his feet wet before he is ready to play on 
an everyday basis at the start of the
1994 season.
The best is saved for last, and the best 
roams at second base under the name of 
Carlos Garcia. Many lamented when 
defensive wizard, Jose Lind, was dealt 
to the Royals last year. What many dont 
realize is that Garcia fields his position 
just as well, if not better, than Lind. 
Even if he is not able to match Lind play 
for play, his bat will only continue to 
improve on what was already an out
standing year. In a few years, Garcia 
will be recognized as one of the premier 
leadoff men in baseball. He can run, as 
evidenced by his 18 stolen bases, hit for 
power (11 HRs), and even drive in an 
occasional run from the leadoff spot as 
shown by his 47 RBIs. Although he 
doesnt draw walks like a leadoff hitter 
should, he most likely will improve on 
this as he becomes more accustomed to 
the pitchers around the league.
Although the bench does not look ex
tremely imposing, Leyland always has a 
knack for getting the most out of what 
hes got. With a combination of veterans 
such as Dave Clark and Lloyd 
McClendon, and young men such as Andy 
Tomberlin and Tony Womack, Leyland 
should have enough to operate effec
tively from the bench. There is also talk 
of popular Gary Varsho returning to the 
Pirates, thus bolstering the bench even 
more.
The offense definitely looks promis
ing, but'that is only half the game, and 
the major reason for the Pirates fall 
from grace this year was the pitching 
staff. After losing veterans, and 20 game 
winners, John Smiley and Doug Drabek 
in two consecutive years, the ace of the 
pitching staff was supposed to be a half 
season veteran knuckleballer named 
Tim Wakefield. By June, Tim had not 
only pitched his way out of the starting 
rotation, but out of the majors as well. 
He did return in September, though, 
after supposedly reacquiring the me
chanics that led to a 9-1 record in 1992, 
and he pitched as if he had reacquired 
those skills. Throwing two consecutive 
shutouts against two of the best offenses
in the National League (Chicago and 
Philadelphia) gives the appearance that 
Wakefield is back in the majors to stay.
Another young gun who had an up and 
down year was lefty rookie, Steve Cooke. 
But Cooke showed in winning 10 games 
as a rookie that he definitely has the 
stuff to be a consistent 15 game winner 
in the majors, as he became the only NL 
pitcher to throw a complete game all 
season against the Phillies, until 
Wakefield did it the final week of the 
season. Maturation is Cookes only prob
lem, but that will come with time.
The starting rotation will be bolstered 
by the return of fifteen game winner 
Randy Tomlin who was sidetracked this 
year with a series of injuries. Tomlin, 
over the past several years, has shown 
that at times that he can be unhittable, 
and assuming that he is healthy should 
continue this streaky method of posting 
14 to 15 wins a year.
The rotation will be further strength
ened by the return of the firebalhng 
rookie, Paul Wagner. Wagner, like 
Cooke, had his ups and downs, but to
wards the end of the year, when his 
position in the starting rotation became 
clear, demonstrated that he had the 
stuff to be a 15 to 20 game winner.
The fifth position in the staff is un
clear for now, but there are a variety of 
options. It could be occupied by veteran 
Bob Walk who may have one more good 
year left in him, or the Pirates could 
enter the free agent market, as there are 
a variety of medium priced hurlers who 
could stabilize the final position. But 
this writer sees that spot eventually, 
possibly in the middle of next season, 
being occupied by a darkhorse named 
John Lieber.
Lieber Was one of the pitchers ac
quired when Stan Belinda was sent to 
Kansas City. Lieber, who was a first 
round pick of the Royals two years ago, 
mowed down the opposition in the single 
A Carolina league and again when he 
joined the double A Carolina Mudcats. 
Lieber throws hard and his rise to the
show should be fairly quick.
As for the bullpen, the Pirates weak
est spot, rookies such as Bias Minor, 
whose stuff is comparable to that-of 
Wagner, and Tony Menendez should 
become stalwarts in their second full* 
season in the majors. Another key will* 
be Denny Neagle, who finally showed^' 
the end of the year why many considered,; 
him one of the premier prospects in, 
baseball just two years ago. There was 
no clear closer after the departure of 
Belinda last year, but rookie Mark Dewey , 
came on to do the job at the end of the: 
year. Even if he shows that he does not 
possess the stuff to be a closer, free agent 
bust Alejandro Pena should be back next? 
year, thus providing a seasoned closer ifthe young guns do not come through;1 
One must also remember that Leylaftd: 
is a master of using the bullpen by com-c 
mittee, e.g., Roger Mason, Bob PateiS 
son, Bob Kipper. u,
And of course, the key to winning 
championships is what the Pirates ex-/ 
celled in this year  defense. The Pi
rates were second best in the league kp> 
errors committed with 105, trailing; 
league leader San Francisco by only four-, 
errors. The defense was superb all yegg, 
and will only get better.
True, the Pirates are lacking in man# 
areas such as power, overall speed, a 
definite closer, and a catcher who may 
not be able to play on an everyday basisCI 
Despite all the teams shortcomings thie

Francis nets l,OOOth pt.; Lemieux returns
The Puck Stops Here
ch aOOan Boureius
Pittsburgh center Ron Francis 
scored a goal and an assist on 
Thursday against the Quebec 
Nordiques to notch the 1,000th 
point of his NHL career. Francis 
is only the 38th player all-time to 
reach the 1,000 point milestone. 
He currently ranks 14th among 
active players in career scoring. 
Bemie Nicholls of the New Jer
sey Devils and Dino Ciccarelli of
the Detroit Red Wings should 
both top 1,000 career points be
fore mid-season. Nicholls is the 
closest; he needs just 15 more 
points. Nicholls next goal will be 
the 400th of his career. Ciccarelli 
needs 13 more goals to reach 500 
for his career. Pittsburghs Joey 
Mullen has an outside chance of 
reaching 1,000 points this season 
as he still needs over 70 points.
Thursdays game also saw the 
return of Mario Lemieux to the 
ice. Lemieux freely admitted that 
hes not yet in top playing shape. 
Nevertheless, he scored two as
sists in the Penguins 7-3 loss to 
the division rival Quebec 
Nordiques. Lemieux is in pursuit 
of his third consecutive Art Ross 
Trophy as the leagues leading 
scorer. All-time scoring leader 
Wayne Gretzky has a 23-point
head start on Lemieux as of 
Thursday. Gretzky commented 
in an interview Wendesday that 
he would have to score 50 or more 
goals and 170 points to beat out 
his rival. Gretzky currently has 
seven goals and 25 points on the 
season. This puts him on a pace 
to score 49 goals and 175 points 
this year. All-time, Gretzky has 
scored 772 goals and 1,581 as
sists for 2,353 points in more than 
14 seasons. Lemieux has scored 
477-699-1166 in nine seasons. 
With his next assist, Lemieux 
will become the 24th player ever 
to top the 700th assist mark. 
Gretzky, already the career as
sists and points leader, should 
surpass Gordie Howes career 
mark of 801 goals by the end of 
January.
The latest word out of Edmon
ton is that Oilers owner Peter 
Pocklington may be considering 
moving the team to Minneapolis, 
Minnesota. Pocklington report
edly met with city officials and 
managers of the recently opened 
Target Centre Arena, in down
town Minneapolis during the past 
week.
Pocklington has been at odds 
with management of the North
lands Coliseum in Edmonton over 
concession and ticket revenues. 
He already contemplated a move 
to Hamilton, Ontario during the 
off-season, but decided against 
moving the club when he reached 
a temporary lease agreement with 
Northlands management. The 
Twin Cities lost its NHL fran
chise this summer when the 
North Stars moved out of the 
aging Met Center in Bloomington
and headed south to become the 
Dallas Stars. If the Oilers do not 
move to Minneapolis, the city will 
be a prime candidate for a new 
franchise when the league ex
pands again, possibly as soon as 
the beginning of the 1995-96 sea
son.
NHL Commissioner Gary 
Bettman is bracing for the first 
labor dispute of his tenure. The 
NHL Officials Association 
(NHLOA), representing all refer
ees and linesmen, has scheduled 
a strike for November 15. NHLOA 
negotiators are trying to win 
higher salaries from league 
managment.
NHL officials salaries are cur
rently far below that of profes
sional, baseball, basketball, or 
football. Bettman has insured 
fans that the league will not tol
erate any disruption in the schi 
ule and that all games will 
played, using substitute officj, 
if necessary.
In the event of a walk-0lli

Quarterback Sneak
ch John Wecer
Although the Phoenix Cardinals have 
gained in the talent department this 
year, they dont seem to be gaining in the 
victory department. After seven games 
the Cardinals are 2-5 with their only 
victories coming over the Washington 
Redskins. While the Cardinals are not 
the most talented team, their biggest 
problem lies the their owners.
At the beginning of this year, 27 teams 
had one goal: to win the Super Bowl. 
However, the Cardinals had a different 
goal: to save their coach. Owner Bill 
Bidwell told coach Joe Bugel, that if he 
didnt ^elevate his 4-12 team to 9-7 in 
1993 he would not be the Cardinals 
coach in 1^94. Some people might think 
this would ihave sparked the team and 
made them play harder for their coach. 
Some might think it is better for an 
owner to be hbjiest with his coach. I 
think it was a disastrous move. All 
Bidwell has done is put more pressure 
on his coach. Lets look at the three 
possible consequences of this ultima
tum from Bidwell.
First possibility: Lets 3ay the Cardi
nals turn it around and go 9^7 or better. 
The goals of the Cardinal players have 
been limited to just going 9-7 and sav
ing the coach. The Cardinals would have 
a tremendous let down. If they go to the 
playoffs, the Cardinals would probably 
get crushed. Bugel and his players would 
be so happy to go 9-7 and go to the 
playoffs that they would forget that there 
was a football game to play. However, 
after a 2-5 start it is unlikely the Cardi
nals will go 9-7 anyway.
Second possibility: Its January 2. Pic
ture the Georgia Dome, the Falcons, and
coach.
Last week was a disaster. Thanks to 
the Oilers, I did get one pick right for 
week eight. For the year: 23-40.
The game everyone is talking about 
is, of course, the Steelers and Browns. 
The Steelers dominated 46 of. the 47 
Cleveland players.
However Eric Metcalf returned two 
punts to lead the Browns to a dramatic
shut down the Bears offense. The Vi
kings needed this win to turn their sea
son around. The Bosworth Award goes 
to the Saints.
The Saints are falling back into their 
rut that they have been stuck in for the 
last couple of years. For the second 
straight week the Saints defense was 
picked apart, this time for 26 points, as 
the Falcons embarrassed the Saints 26-
15. The Falcons are looking better, but28-23 win. The Steelers are better than 
Joe Bugels 8-7 Cardinals. Bidwell promtheir 4-3 record. Last week ODonnell they still have a long way to go. 
ised to fire Bugel if he doesnt go 9-7. continued to improve at quarterback as The Bills beat the Jets 19-10. Buffalos 
What if they lose to Atlanta 21-20? What the Steeler offense doubled the Browns defense is the best NFL defense I have
if the Cardinals win their 
last five under Bugel and 
finish the season 8-8? If 
your answer to this is that 
Bidwell could still change 
his mind, then Bidwell 
should have kept his 
mouth shut in the first 
place.
Third possibility: The 
Cardinals go on a big los
ing streak. The Cardinals 
are 2-8 three weeks from 
now. What incentive will 
Bugel have to try to develop young play
ers for the future? Will Bugel even show 
up for work? \yill Bugel even care if the 
Cardinals finish the season? My guess is 
that Bidwell will have to fire Bugel be
fore the end of the year anyway.
The point is that last year Joe Gibbs
At the beginning of this year; 27 
teams had one goal: to win the 
Super Bowl. However; the Cardi
nals had a different goal: to save 
their coach."
offensive yardage. Remember, it took 
two dramatic plays and no offensive 
turnovers by the Browns to get a victory. 
The Steelers have a long comeback road 
to travel. Even without quarterback 
Vinny Testeverde the Browns should be 
able to go at least 10-6. Pittsburgh has 
quit coaching because of the pressure of to match the Browns win for win until
the job. Gibbs job was never even in 
jeopardy! Bugel, on the other hand, not 
only has the pressures of the job to 
handle, but he also has this ultimatum 
hanging over his head. I think the Car
dinals need a new owner not a new
they can get their hands on them again 
on January 2.
The Vikings win the Team of the Week 
award with their 19-12 victory over the 
Bears. Their new offensive scheme had 
the Bears stumped while their defense
seen in years (possibly 
ever).
The Jets year is going 
down the drain fast. The 
Dolphins looked impres
sive without Marino as 
they romped the Colts 41- 
27. This game really 
wasnt close until the Dol
phins allowed the Colts a 
few points late in the
_____________ game. Without Marino,
the Dolphins wont go far
ther than the Champion
ship Game, and without Steve Emtman 
the Colts wont be going to the playoffs. 
However, I was impressed with Jeff 
Georges arm. I didnt see him play much 
last year. The Colts dont need a quar
terback, but they need some receivers 
that can catch.
Week eight included several meaning
less games. The Oilers beat the Bengals 
2812, however it is worth noting that 
the Oilers trailed 97 at halftime.
The Pack rolled over the Bucs 3714. 
The Lions squeaked past the Rams 16- 
13. Those 52 first place Lions continue
to baffle the experts.
The 49ers beat the Cardinals 28-lj 
and Jerry Rice caught his umpteenth 
touchdown. And finally, the Seahawks 
crept above .500 with a 10-9 win over 
the New England Patriots.
Top Five Picks for Week 10
1. Denver at Cleveland 
Without Testaverde, the Cleveland
BrownKmust rely on aging Bemie Kosa; 
for the ftst of the year. This should bi 
close, but the Broncos always do well

Young stars herald change in NBA
The Sixth Men
Bh Shankara Sarveneram 
& Ian Tomas
The NBA regular season is just a week away, and we have already 
seen a dramatic shift in title contenders. With the sudden losses of 
all-star point guard Tim Hardway and valuable reserve Sarunas 
Marciulionis for the season with knee injuries, and all-star forward 
Chris Mullin for the first month and a half of the season with a hand 
injury, the Golden State Warriors championship aspirations have 
gone the way of Sabertooth tiger. The acquistion of former San 
Antonio point guard Avery Johnson and the development of secondyear man Keith Jennings will help fill the part of the void left by 
Hardaway, but the two sub-6'0" point guards cannot fill Hardaways 
sizeable shoes. Despite the addition of rookie star Chris Webber, and 
the precense of rising stars Billy Owens and Latrell Sprewell, look 
for the Warriors to struggle early on in the season.
The apparent downfall of Golden State leaves an opening for the 
up and coming Seattle Supersonics. The speed of Shawn Kemp, 
newly acquired Kendall Gill, and the rest of the Sonics will give the 
defending Western champion Phoenix Suns a lot of trouble late in 
the season.
In Phoenix, Charles Barkley recently announced his possible 
retirement at the end of the year. He suffered fainting spells due to 
a spinal problem, and will require surgery after the season. That 
leaves him with one more year to try and lead the Suns to that elusive 
championship. With all-star guards Kevin Johnson and Dan Majerle 
and ex-L.A. Laker star A.C. Green, they should have a strong team 
despite the losses of forwards Tom Chambers (free agency), Richard 
Dumas (drug suspension) and, at least temporarily, Cedric Ceballos 
(leg injury). Jarrod Mustaf has finally begun to tap his huge poten
tial this season, and ex-Boston Celtic center Joe Kleine should give 
the Suns some bulk in the middle along with up-and-coming Oliver 
Miller and veteran Mark West. Big Malcolm Mackey should add to 
one of the Wests deepest front lines, while veteran Danny Ainge is
the gun from the backcourt.
In recent years, the rookie talent pool has been outstanding, and 
this year will be no exception. The draft features some outstanding 
players among the lottery picks. Webber, the first overall pick, will 
give the Warriors the inside threat they always have lacked.
Shawn Bradley, Anfemee Penny Hardaway, Isaiah dont call 
me J.R. Rider, and Jamal Mashbum, the rest of the top five picks, 
will all be necessary additions to their teams.
The fight for Rookie of the Year honors will not be as clear cut as 
theNyear before. The leading candidate, however, is Anfemee 
Hardaway from the Orlando Magic, thanks to all the hype surrounding^second-year superstar Shaquille ONeal. The All Rookie team 
will include Webber, Anfemee Hardaway, Mashbum, and suprises 
Rodney Rogers from Denver and Calbert Cheaney from Washington. 
College point guard sensation Bobby'Hurley needs another year in 
Sacramento 'before he steps up to the level of this all-star field, 
though he may ,start ahead of veteran Spud Webb.
This draft will produce several top-notch players, but no franchise 
players like Shaq, Alonzo Mourning, and Tom Gugliotta, but it will 
prove to be deeper in talent.
The passing of the torch in the NBA is occuring after the retire
ments of Michael Jordan, Magic J ohnson, and Larry Bird. But which 
ofthe young stars will rise to meetthe challenge ofNBA superstardom?
In other news, Dream Team Ilfaas been assembled. This team will 
feature ONealprovided he can avoid an endorsement conflict that 
prevented him from being among tt*e first players named.; Other 
stars like Mourning, Kemp, New Jerseys Derrick Coleman, and 
Charlottes Larry Johnson are definitely participating. Also in
cluded are Dominique Wilkins of the Atlanta Hawks, Cleveland 
Caveliers Mark Price, Joe Dumars of the Detroit Pistons, Majerle, 
and Miami point guard Steve Smitli. Tim lardaway was to be part 
of the team, but his knee injury M necessitate a replacement. This 
team compares in no way with the DreamvTeam of old but will 
obviously be dominant in the World Championships.
Once again, Detroit Pistons guard Ispah Thomas will not be part 
ofthe Dream Team. The long-tim^e leader of the Pistons will have to 
spend his season teaching rookies Lindsay Hunter and Allan'Hous
ton the ropes rather than practicing for,a gold-medal ceremony. 
Snubbed from the original Dream Team, Thomas will probably not 
be around for Dream Team III.
