...And Other Highlights
Starting the 
festivities early 
and raising money 
to fight MS in the 
process, Fraternity 
Theta Xi and 
Soroity Delta Delta 
Delta sponsored a 
pole sit, a pie 
throw and a free 
barbecue during 
the week before 
Carnival.

ControversyOvershadowsClosingCeremonies
By ALBRECHT T. POWELLTartan Managing Editor
The closing ceremonies to Carnival 1987 were 
shadowed in the controversy surrounding the winner 
of the Buggy competition. Ali the mens races held 
on Saturday morning were disqualified because rain 
forced the cancellation of the last three heats. This 
led to Friday's time of 2:11.35 for Spirit As buggy 
Sting becoming the winning time for Sweepstakes 
'87. Beta was not pleased.
Friday's heats went off without a hitch. Saturday 
morning was clouded with the threat of rain. The 
Alumni heats afforded a win to Sigma Nu 
(Nemesis). During the Exhibition heats, two of the 
intended six heats ran. PilamB (Miss Budwiser) and 
DU A (Biakar, which spun and crashed) rolled, but 
the other Pilam and DU buggies were postponed, as 
was ATQ, until the end, due to the threat of rain. 
(They never had a chance to race due to the rain). 
There were no problems with the Women's heats 
which gave Spirit A (Sting) first place.
Then, during finals, all but the last three heats 
were completed with Beta A (Nike) in the lead with 
a time better than Spirit's of the previous day. 
With the next heat of Spirit A (Sting) and Beta B 
(DLB) still to run, this would probably be the 
deciding heat
As the countdown was progressing, a faint drizzle 
had begun. Shawn Stufft decided to hold the 
countdown at 15 seconds due to the rain and the 
protest of Spirit buggy chairman Robert Bowie. 
Bowie felt the rain was a definite threat to the safety 
of his driver, and protested the run. Beta, however, 
wanted to roll.
After announcing a five minute delay, and almost 
immediately thereafter a 30 minute delay, the rain 
continued. Trish DiMarco, assistant sweepstakes 
chairman said, "There was water sitting on the road, 
it was just too wet" As soon as the delay was 
announced, Stufft also opened the course.
"Pittsburgh Police started to clear out Even the 
ambulance left without our say so...[there was] 
nothing we could do, really," DiMarco commented. 
Cars began to drive through the course, and also 
park. Drivers left their cars, and nothing could 
really be done.
At the closing ceremonies, the winners of the 
men's finals were announced last. Beta received 
second place and many people were booing. 
DiMarco, who was handing out the trophies, didn't 
hand it [the trophy] to Paul Browning, the Beta 
chairman, but instead put it on the table. Spirit 
was announced as the winner. They set off several 
smoke bombs, and there was a lot of yelling and 
rejoicing. Bowie said, "We didn't want to win the 
back way. Beta, well be here next year." In 
apparent response, one of the Beta members tipped 
their trophy over, and Paul Browning, Beta 
chairman, grabbed the mike from closing 
ceremonies chairman Phil Hollenberg, held up 
their trophy, and said, "What counts is the times on 
Saturday rolls. You guys don't deserve it We'll 
trade our trophy for yours anytime, anywhere, the 
rest of the year  we'll be here." Beta then left the 
stage, refusing to accept their trophy.
Speaking with Browning after carnival was over, 
he commented, "I really think that the last heat 
should have been run. We could have run the race. 
It was bad for us and for Spirit. I think Spirit 
would like to have beaten us fair and square. I dont 
have anything against Spirit I have something 
against the person who made the decision."
Browning called Bowie on Sunday to apologize 
for his actions at the closing ceremonies and 
attributed some of it to alcohol.
