A deal has been finalized that will 
allow CMU students to ride Port Au
thority Transit (PAT) buses using 
their CMU identification cards starting 
this summer.
The PAT board of directors voted last 
Friday on a deal that will cost CMU 
$567,500 and will start this July 1.
There were no questions [about the 
deal] at the board. Were very happy, 
said Don Bell, chief operations officer 
for PAT.
CMU students will pay $35 as part of 
their student activities fee next semes
ter to ride the buses. The arrangement 
will be part of a five-year deal with PAT. 
According to Bell, there will be a window 
of two to eight percent in which the price 
can be raised.
We feel that [the window] is fair to 
both parties.... Its a mutual protection 
honestly, said Bell.
He added that the average person in
Allegheny County who uses the buses 
pays 92 cents for each ride. He said that 
eventually PATs goal will be to have 
CMU riders pay that amount, but he 
also said that he realizes that there is a 
discount involved in the current deal 
between PAT and CMU.
Sarah Gross, student body president 
and a junior social history major, said 
that the fee for CMU students could go 
up or down by at most five dollars 
per year.
Bell said that the PAT board hopes the 
ridership will be comparable to that of 
the University of Pittsburgh. In the first 
seven months of their deal, the Pitt stu
dents and faculty rode the PAT buses 
almost three million times.
The first year is always an assess
ment period.... Its hard to put a number 
to it, said Bell.
In order to gauge CMU ridership, bus 
drivers will designate a counter button 
on their control board that they will 
push every time a CMU student shows 
their ID to ride. Bell said that such
things as student housing and the 
number of daily commuters will factor 
into the actual amount the buses are 
used.
Well have to be careful. Weve found 
that there is an overload in the mid
day and in the evening. Maybe we will 
have to put new service out, he said.
Bell said that PAT is currently ag
gressively attacking the suburban 
markets. In addition, the deal will 
mean additional revenue along with a 
more predictable ridership.
I think students will want to use 
[the buses]. It will be an opportunity 
to go into Pittsburgh and get off 
campus, said Gross. She said that 
she thinks RAs will take advantage 
of the deal by holding more off-cam
pus activities such as trips to the 
theater and sporting events. Gross 
also added that the deal will benefit 
students who have internships in 
the area during the summer. This is 
the ultimate win-win kind of deal, 
said Bell.

Carnegie Mellons code of 
standards is about to be
come more noticeable 
around campus.
Both the administration 
and Student Government 
are working to change the 
language and the distribu
tion procedures of the Carn
egie Mellon Code to make it 
more relevant to the Uni
versity community.
 The Carnegie Mellon Code 
in its current form is a fiveparagraph document outlin
ing standards of academic 
integrity. 4iWhatits basically 
saying is that you should be 
honest in what you do and 
you should respect the work 
of others, said senior me
chanical engineering major 
Amy Ng, chair of Student
Senates Academic Affairs 
Committee, who has been ac
tive in discussions of the 
codes future.
The code is currently 
printed in the first-year 
guidebook The Word and on 
several relevant Web pages, 
but not in many other places 
where students might see 
it. The University Student 
Affairs Council (USAC), a 
committee made up of fac
ulty, administration, and 
students, has been looking 
into ways to make the code 
more visible on campus and 
came up with a list of pre
liminary suggestions to con
sider. These include plac
ing copies of the code in 
classrooms and including 
them in admissions pack
ets with a requirement that 
incoming first-year stu
dents sign them.
Student Government offi
cials first became interested 
in the code when Ng was 
invited to a USAC meeting 
in her capacity as Academic 
Affairs chair earlier this 
month. She had gone regard
ing another initiative, but 
decided to stay to hear the 
USAC address the code. She 
had two main critiques. The 
code talks about the campus 
community as a whole but 
places the burden on stu
dents, she said, adding that 
the language should apply 
equally to faculty. The sug
gested method of distribu
tion to first-year students 
also seemed less than ideal 
to Ng. Having [the code] as 
part of the admissions 
packet may not achieve what 
we really want to do, be
cause students may look

Serbs hunt down 
women refugees
BRAZDA, Macedonia (AP)  City 
by city and village by village, Serbs 
are hunting down young women to 
rape as they loot, empty, and burn 
Kosovos ethnic Albanian communi
ties, women escaping beyond the 
provinces borders say.
International monitors, war crimes 
investigators, and NATO all are re
porting numerous accounts of rapes in 
Kosovoatrocities that Yugoslav and 
Serb officials deny.
Witness testimony so far indicates 
the rapes in Kosovo are neither 
isolated nor incidental,  said 
Patricia Sellers, a U.N. war crimes 
prosecutor at The Hague, Netherlands, 
whose workers are gathering the 
first accounts.
When the police entered the town, 
that was the first question they asked: 
Are there any women here? said 
Valbona Rrustemi, 19, of the southern 
Kosovo town of Urosevac.
Rrustemi fled Urosevac with her 
family April 16, the day after two 
girls came running through her 
familys garden saying Serb police 
were after them.
Minutes later, police knocked at the 
familys door, asking if there were any 
young women, she said. Her father 
said no while she hid, Rrustemi said.
Word later reached her of four 
Urosevac women who had been 
caught by the Serbs that day, she 
said. They included a friend who was 
raped in the street, Rrustemi said. 
She named the friend and gave her 
age, 22.
The womans cousins had confirmed 
the attack, Rrustemi said. No one has 
heard of the woman or her immediate 
family since.
I dont know what happened to 
them. I hoped they escaped, said
Rrustemi, one of several women at 
the Brazda refugee camp to give 
accounts of rapes in Urosevac.
NATO, also citing refugee ac
counts, contends there have been 
several instances of mass 
rapes, well-organized on at least a 
local level:
At Djakovica, near the Albanian 
border, Serb soldiers allegedly took 
women from their families and sent 
them to an army camp where they 
were held for repeated rapes.
In Pec, a local Serb commander 
allegedly held ethnic Albanian 
women at a hotel, organizing a 
schedule by which his soldiers could 
come to spend an evening.
At an ammunition factory and 
ferronickel plant at an unspecified 
site in Kosovo, 100 women allegedly 
were still being held as of mid-April.
In many cases, word that Serbs 
were separating ethnic Albanians 
into groups of women and men was 
enough to send families fleeing  
making rape a means of emptying 
communities, as much as massa
cres, arson, and looting.
The intent is not just to intimi
date and humiliate the actual physi
cal victim but also to somehow in
timidate those who are standing 
there either looking at it or hear 
about it, Sellers said.
The United Nations first pros
ecuted rape as a separate war 
crime after the 1992-5 Bosnian 
war. In the first case to focus ex
clusively on rape, the U.N. War 
Crimes Tribunal for former Yugo
slavia sentenced a Bosnian Croat 
paramilitary chief in December to 
10 years in prison for failing to 
stop subordinates 1993 rape of a 
Bosnian Muslim woman.
Another virus tops 
most-wanted list
WASHINGTON (AP)  A virus that 
can erase a computers hard-drive and 
prevent the equipment from restarting is 
poised to strike on Monday, but experts 
say off-the-shelf antivirus software can 
prevent infection, and several companies 
are offering free inoculation tools on their 
Web sites.
The virus has been dubbed Chernobyl 
because its most common version was pro
grammed to activate on computers using 
Windows 95 and Windows 98 on Monday, 
the 13th anniversary of the nuclear disas
ter in Ukraine.
Another less common version strikes 
computers on the 26th day of any month.
Its pretty much just another virus. Its 
been around for quite a while, said Kathy 
Fithen, manager of the Computer Emer
gency Response Team, or CERT, at Carn
egie Mellon University. As long as people 
stay current with their antivirus software, 
they should be in good shape.
The viruses, believed to originate in 
Taiwan, attempt to erase a computers 
hard-drive and write gibberish to the 
computers system settings, called its 
BIOS, preventing the machine from be
ing restarted.
But warnings from many experts lacked 
any sense of panic or impending doom 
because the virus was discovered last sum
mer, giving antivirus companies many 
months to develop free software updates to 
identify and destroy it.
Users of those products will be protected 
only if theyve retrieved the free updates.
Network Associates Inc., for example, 
said its popular McAfee software recog
nized Chernobyl as early as June 1998, 
and Symantec Corp. said its Norton 
Antivirus program identified Chernobyl 
before August.
CERT issued a warhing this week about 
the virus because of questions from com
puter users.
Were getting requests for information 
about it rather than reports of machines 
infected with it, Fithen said. This has 
been around so long that the antivirus 
vendors have picked this up.
Unlike the recent Melissa scare, which
automatically propagated via e-mail, 
this virus doesnt spread as quickly 
because it requires a person to launch 
an infected program file to contaminate 
a computer.
Carey Nachenberg, chief researcher 
at Symantecs Antivirus Research Cen
ter, said one big risk stems from a poten
tial infection on a companys computer 
network, which could then spread to 
individual computers.
If it gets on a corporate network 
and the volumes are not protected, it 
could spread very, very rapidly, 
Nachenberg said.
Gene Hodges, a vice president for 
security at Network Associates, said the 
company was hoping for the best but 
bracing for the worse. It can be fairly 
significant, he said. You dont know 
until the bomb actually goes off.
Aussies slaughter 
flocks of chickens
SYDNEY, Australia (AP)  Navy 
personnel arrived on Australias south
eastern coast Sunday to help in the 
slaughter of 1.5 million chickens to con
trol the countrys worst outbreak of ani
mal disease.
Chickens are being slaughtered on 30 
farms in the Mangrove Mountain Ridge 
area to stop an epidemic of Newcastle 
disease, named for the nearby city of 
Newcastle, 80 miles north of Sydney.
The plan to isolate the disease and 
protect Australias billion-dollar poul
try industry will involve a massive op
eration involving about 600 people, New 
South Waless state agriculture depart
ment said. Some 90 Navy personnel are 
now involved.
Animals suffering from the disease 
display no visible symptoms before dy
ing, and the virus is not believed to pose 
a risk to humans.
The slaughter began last September 
after 1,200 birds died on two farms. At 
that time, 100,000 chickens were killed, 
but the mass slaughter has been stepped 
up only in the last two weeks.
More than 400 people from the Local 
Exotic Disease Control Center are al
ready working to wipe out the disease,
and the slaughter should be completed 
by the end of the week, officials said.
Expert tells truth 
about getting old
PITTSBURGH (AP)  While expert 
Robert Kahn addressed a conference on 
aging, 75-year-old Anthony LaCapra was 
completing his 1 1/2-hour workout on a 
stationary bike and treadmill.
Kahn explained that much of what 
Americans believe about aging is either 
myth or half-truth. LaCapra, who is re
tired, was following a fitness regimen 
that would make many youthful week
end warriors weep.
After his workout on the bike and tread
mill, he uses resistance weights for about 
an hour before turning to the pool for an 
hour of laps.
And LaCapra does this three time$ 
each week.
I had my ups and downs in earlier 
years, LaCapra said. But it dawned on 
me after I retired. Instead of being a 
couch potato, I could keep active and 
live longer.
Thats just what Kahn, co-author of 
the book Successful Aging, was telling an 
audience April 9 at the 14th Annual 
Regional Geriatric Conference. Upstairs, 
in the Downtown Athletic Club, LaCapra 
was working out.
Its up to you; genes are not your 
destiny, said Kahn, a psychology and 
public health professor at the University 
of Michigan.
Kahn, 81, says while many people 
blame getting old on fate and genetics, 
staying young is mostly a lifestyle choice.
While your cellular blueprint does have 
some influence on how well you age, 
much of that can be counteracted with a 
lifestyle that includes regular exercise 
and healthy eating habits.
Unfortunately, studies show that only 
about one in every five elderly people gets 
any regular exercise, Kahn said. That is 
sad, because muscle atrophy is not only 
reversible, but avoidable, he said.
The good news is that years of inactiv
ity and unhealthy living can be 
reversed with consistent exercise in 
later years.

LITTLETON, Colo. (AP)  A 
detailed diary by one of the Col
umbine High School gunmen 
showed they were going for the 
big kill in a suicide attack that 
had been planned for a year be
fore they struck on Adolf 
Hitlers birthday, the sheriff 
said Saturday.
The bottom line of this thing is 
they wanted to do as much dam
age as they could possibly do, and 
destroy this school, and destroy as 
many children as they could and 
go out in flames, Jefferson County 
Sheriff John Stone told reporters.
It was the strongest official 
statement about the motive for 
Tuesdays murder-suicide ram
page that killed 12 students, one 
teacher, and two teen gunmen.
The handwritten diary, dis
covered in one of the gunmens
homes, uses German phrases 
and goes back a year. Stone said 
the assailants reasoning was: 
We want to be different, we 
want to be strange, and we dont 
want jocks or other people put
ting (us) down.... Were going to 
punish you. Stone said he didnt 
know which of the gunmen kept 
the diary.
The sheriff also placed some 
blame on the parents of Dylan 
Klebold and Eric Harris. He 
noted that along with the diary, 
investigators found a shotgun 
barrel on a dresser and bombmaking materials.
A lot of this stuff was clearly 
visible, and the parents 
should have known, said 
Stone. I think parents should 
be accountable for their 
kids actions.
The parents have not com
mented beyond separate written 
statements released by their at
torneys. The statements ex
pressed sorrow and sympathy for 
the victims families.
The diary shows that Klebold, 
17, and Harris, 18, had been 
planning the attack for a year. 
The teens also had a school map 
that noted where the school was 
ill-lit and pointed out possible 
hiding places. The diary also 
revealed that they monitored 
the lunch room to find out when 
the greatest number of people 
would be there.
They were going for a big kill, 
said Stone. This had been on 
their minds and theyve been 
planning this particular thing and 
theyve been building bombs ... 
for a considerable period of time.
Theyve been acquiring weaponry 
for a considerable period of time. 
Asked why they picked April 
20, the sheriff said, It was Hitlers 
birthday. He added: It was a 
Nazi kind of thing.
Stone briefed reporters as a 
weekend of funerals began. At 
the Trinity Christian Center, a 
mile south of Columbine High, 
students walked to the pulpit one 
by one to mourn Rachel Scott, 17.
Sobbing and hollow-eyed, they 
remembered a girl who loved life, 
adored acting, and was nice to 
people she didnt know. A truer 
friend you couldnt find, Nick 
Baumgart said.
Earlier friends and family wrote 
comments in black felt pen on 
Scotts casket. Friends said she 
was killed outside the school, one 
of the first to be shot.
Heidi Johnson, a friend of 
Scott since fourth grade, wiped 
tears as she kneeled and wrote 
on the casket, Rachel, Im so 
proud of you! I will miss you 
dearly. You were truly one of 
my true best friends, and I love 
you from the bottom of my 
heart. Other messages said, 
See you in Heaven, You are 
my hero, and You always 
brought a smile to my face. 
Her father wrote simply: I love 
you. Dad. Forever.
Police have interviewed hun
dreds of witnesses and collected 
2,000 pieces of evidence, down 
to the smallest scraps of metal 
at the school, in the search not 
only for a motive but to deter
mine whether Harris and 
Klebold had accomplices, before 
or during the shootings.
Students and police had deL 
scribed one gunman wearing a 
white t-shirt, while witnesses also 
spoke of two gunmen in dark.dusters. But the body of one of the 
gunmen did not have a trench 
coat on.
Its very possible, were think
ing now, that maybe the trench 
coat was shed at some point, 
said sheriffs spokesman Steve 
Davis. Now... maybe were back 
to two suspects instead of the 
white-shirt third suspect.
But later Davis said that the 
chances are even increasing of 
further involvement by others. 
He refused to give details, saying, 
We have to be very, very careful 
at this point of what we release. 
No arrests have been made and 
no other suspects beyond the dead 
gunmen have been identified.

38 underage patrons, most of 
whom were CMU students 
were detained.
Several sources claimed that 
fights between CMU and Pitt stu

report the underage drinking to 
the police.
Also on this date, a fire took 
place in one of the ventillator units 
outside of Porter Hall A27, the

the department spent between 
$10,000 and $13,000 on ringers 
for every concert.
Students also accused ac

Construction work associated with 
the Purnell Center continues as work
ers tear up the Cut to add new side
walks and landscaping. The new 
building will have its grand opening 
in September.
Everything should be right on 
schedule, said Project Manager Tom 
Murphy. The third floor offices are 
finished. We are 
working on the wood 
flooring for all of the 
dance studios and 
theater rigging is 
[ready] right now.
According to 
Murphy, faculty and 
staff will move into 
those offices on Au
gust 1, 1999. Class
rooms will be com
pleted in early fall, 
said Murphy. In 
September and early 
October we will run 
it over to the Drama 
Drpartment.
Many students are 
excited about the 
new building. I am 
looking forward to 
my classes being in 
the new building, 
said sophomore 
drama major Melissa 
Palombi. We will re
ally take advantage of it.
Productions in the main theater 
could start as early as the winter 
and will continue into the spring.
The main theater on the first floor will 
have a capacity of 430 people. The 
theater is also integrated into the build
ing. One other aspect of the theater is 
the 24-foot-high soundproof doors, con
necting it to a nearby shop. These doors 
will facilitate construction and moveon of scenery.
The second floor will contain the sound 
and lighting booths as well as the scene 
shop. On the third floor of the building, 
there are theater, dance, movement, and
floor also contains drafting rooms 
where the primary source of light is 
natural light from large skylights on 
the roof of the building.
The outside of the building is 
taking shape with the completion of 
the landscaping designs. More 
plans are underway for the rest of 
the Cut. After commencement, we 
will tear up the rest of the Cut and 
plant more grass and trees, 
said Murphy.

dent leaders had considered asking for 
another fee, similar to the $25,000 com
pensation for Mondays filming.
Paramount raised hell about it, and 
we decided to leave it at that, said Anthe.
Anthe, said that he had heard that 
someone involved in the films production 
was extremely upset about Paramount 
havingto compensate students with money
happened. She said the duty of the film 
office in this situation was to bring the 
two parties to the table.
We were able to work it out, and every
body got what they wanted, she said.
Keezer also said that the film has 
employed over 200 Pittsburgh residents 
and provided opportunities for various 
CMU extras. She said she also feels 
confident that Wonder Boys has helped 
the Pittsburgh film industry.
Still, Anthe said he has had enough of 
the production. Personally, Im sick of 
the whole thing  Im tired of being 
pulled out of whatever Im doing to fix 
their problems.... Considering that its a 
very nice day outside, they should be 
packed up by the end of the day and well 
never see them again, he said Sunday.
On Sunday, Wonder Boys spokesperson 
Eric Myers released a statement that said 
[W]e do want to thank CMU and its stu
dents for being so accommodating, and for 
allowing us to film on what is surely one of 
the most beautiful campuses in America.Housing anticipates new dorm
From DORM, page 1
According to Reed, the reason 
Housing is building a new dorm 
is because its goal is to move 
people out of the Oakland apart
ments. He said that the apart
ments are expensive for students 
to lease out, and Housing is hop.ingto reduce the number of people 
.in Cathedral Mansions, Fairfax 
and Webster. The Housing office 
currently rents over 500 beds in 
the Oakland apartments area as 
part of the housing system.
Michael said aside from being 
expensive, the biggest concerns 
expressed by residents are the 
lack of direct connection to the 
campus computer network and
dorm will possess are large double 
suites where two doubles share a 
kitchen and bath, small and large 
meeting rooms and lounges for 
group project work, quiet study, 
and recreation, a computer print 
station, a public kitchen, a laun
dry, a TV room, and a storage 
room. The current planning calls 
for the dorm to be co-educational 
by shared two-double suites. Cur
rently the plan is to have the 
administrative offices on the 
ground floor similar to those in 
Morewood. According to Reed, the 
Housing Office is planning on 
moving to the new dorm, and 
subsequently will reopen E-tower 
offices as rooms again. There
The new dorm will be built in the
jthe perceived distance to campus 
classes and activities.
It will be more convenient for 
residents and more cost effective 
to create more housing on the 
campus proper sometime in the 
near future, said Michael.
Reed said that by opening more 
spaces on campus, Housing is 
hoping to reduce the number of 
people that get put where they 
dont want to be.
I may be mistaken on this, 
;but most people dont choose 
'[Cathedral Mansions] and 
Fairfax, but [rather] get stuck 
with them because of their room 
"draw number or some similar 
problem, said Reed.
Reed added that one of the big 
problems encountered this year 
was the number of first-years liv
ing in the Hampton Inn. The num
ber of people in the housing sys
tem has grown by approximately 
S300 people in the last three years. 
The new dorm is scheduled to 
"accommodate 270-280 people.
Some components the new
Elizabeth Splridakis/Tartan rOgSg 4MeSgm 
ditch between Donner and Resnik.
are 2 to 3 plans in the works so I 
dont know if theyve decided 
which one to go with, said Reed.
When the initial planningbegan 
in 1997, a programming commit
tee consisting of SDC representa
tives, other students, Student Life 
staff, and Housing staff surveyed 
students and benchmarked other 
universities to create a series of 
recommendations on the building. 
During Spring 1998, we con
structed life-size models of sample 
room configurations in Morewood 
Gardens, and over 300 students 
toured and gave more feedback on 
the rooms that shaped the final 
design, said Michael.
Reed, however, said that al
though Housing has made plans 
to go ahead with the dorm, not 
all students are pleased with 
-the decision.
Nobody likes the plan, said 
Reed. Firstly, were going to lose 
the field space. Secondly, the
by the new dorm building. Then, 
the residents of Donner, Resnik, 
and West Wing will be looking 
into other peoples rooms.
In addition to this, Reed said 
that he had concerns about the 
type of trend the new dorm might 
be setting.
Youll be walking down an. 
area, and youll have a building 
on either side of you. Its the first 
urban-like construction weve 
had, he said. It is a great con
cern to people who dont want to 
lose the green that we have, de
spite the fact that were in a city. 
When asked why Housing is us
ing the grassy Donner area as its 
current space for construction, 
Reed said that construc
tion between Morewood 
and Mudge is very un
likely in the near fu
ture. In order to build 
between Morewood and 
Mudge, Housing would 
need the permission of 
peoplelivingin the area. 
According to Reed, this 
permission is not forth
coming, and Housing is 
in the process of buying 
up houses in area.
[But] some of the 
families dont want to 
move. It is a matter of 
time before we get all 
the land so we have 
all the necessary vari
ants to build a dorm 
there, he said.
Since so many people 
have been against this, Reed said 
that he has taken a position 
against the building of the new 
dorm in the Donner area.
Everyone is aware that it is a 
bad idea, he said. A petition has 
circulated with 200 signatures 
opposing the new dorms loca
tion. Signatures on the petition 
include those of Donner residents, 
architecture and design majors 
who dont want their space shad
owed, and residents of Resnik 
and West Wing.
There has been a large amount 
of official student response to 
this, so we may have a forum, 
said Reed.
The residence hall described 
is the only project of its type in 
current planning. Comments 
were sought from all campus con
stituencies, and concerns were 
received from students and oth
ers, said Michael. This feedCarnegie Mellon In Brief

UC pool shuts 
down in May
The University Center swim
ming and diving pool will be clos
ing for the month of May to re
place the filter tank. The reasons 
for the extended closure of the 
pool are the lengthy work process 
and rigorous activities needed to 
put the pool back in the best work
ing order possible. Some of the 
steps workers will have to go 
through include removing old 
sand from the present tanks, in
stalling new tanks, and restruc
turing all piping attached to the 
filter system.

CODE, from page 1
upon the code as one more thing 
they have to sign rather than as 
something different, she said.
When Ng mentioned the 
USAC recommendations in the 
course of an April 12 Senate
tween the three of them and 
Dean of Student Affairs Michael 
Murphy so that the administra
tion would be aware of their 
point of view.
The meeting was a success for 
the Senators. Murphy was amePart of the code is that were honor

SCS Senator
meeting, several other Senators 
had concerns as well. Signing 
the code would be almost un
necessary, said sophomore 
Marcin Jeske, then an SCS 
Senator-at-Large. Part of the 
code is that were honorable and 
truthful. I think people at CMU 
can live up to that.
Jeske and senior electrical and 
computer engineering major and 
CIT Senator Matt Monroe dis
cussed their concerns with Ng, 
who scheduled a meeting be
nable to their ideas about signing 
and about the codes inclusive
ness and promised that the ad
ministration would actively col
lect student input in future stages 
of discussion about the code. Ac
cording to Ng, this meeting and 
the events leading up to it pro
vide an example of how studentadministration communication 
should work. Student Govern
ment was able to bring up con
cerns at the initial start of the 
discussions, she said, which
means that it can actively make 
sure student needs are being ad
dressed from the-early stages of 
the process.
The Senators also stressed 
Murphys receptivity to future 
student feedback regarding the 
code. We talked about how to 
increase communication be
tween students and administra
tion, said Monroe. That will be 
good for students and good for 
the administration.
There are no plans right now 
to send the code to first-years, 
said Ng. There are no plans to 
put it in classrooms. But there 
are plans to form a group of stu
dents to get together to discuss 
with the administration differ
ent ways of promoting the docu
ment and to figure out if the 
document itself needs to be 
changed to encompass more of 
the campus community. Besides 
this committee, forums for stu
dent input and ideas about the 
code may include town meetings 
next semester.
Monroe is optimistic about 
refining the code. Its a 
hard problem, but it is doable, 
he said. And it can 
improve CMU.
Students learn online
LANGUAGES, from page 1
second co-project director and 
a professor of applied linguis
tics and head of the Modern 
Languages Department, the el
ementary language courses at 
CMU are very intensive and 
can meet between four and five 
times a week depending on the 
language. Language Online will 
cut down on traditional class
room time, with only one class 
meeting a week. According to 
Jones, students who have been 
unable to take language courses 
because of rigorous schedules 
will have the ability to immerse 
themselves in language learn
ing while keeping their own 
hours.
Tucker will work closely with 
The Center for Innovation in 
Learning to determine the ef
fectiveness of the pilot courses.
It is an opportunity to see if 
there is value added [learning 
over the Internet], said Tucker.
Our guess is [Language 
Online] will compare well to 
the classroom experience, said 
Jones. Our goal is that it will 
be equal if not better [than] 
face-to-face language learning.
According to Jones, other uni
versities, such as Northwestern 
University, Virginia Common
wealth University, and Christo
pher Newport University, have 
augmented their language classes 
with Internet activities. However, 
moving the entire course to a Web 
basis is fairly uncommon.
The demand for French and Span
ish languages, as well as the fact 
that J ones is a professor in French, 
were the reasons that the project 
will be started in those languages.
According to Tucker, other lan
guages might move to Language 
Online' if the pilot classes are
would be nice to see the develop-i 
ment of materials into language 
we are not able to teach at CMU.*
Additionally, Tucker suggested 
the possibility of developing a li
brary of materials in a variety o^ 
languages that could develop into 
a consortium between other Pitts-1 
burgh universities across the Web.
If you look at the nationwide 
statistics [for language classes] 
enrollments have declined by three 
percent, said Tucker. At CMU 
enrollments have increased by 20 
percent, and students arent even 
required to take language classes.
Our goal is that it will be equal if not 
better [than] face-to-face language 
learning.

beneficial and more funding is 
made available.
I would like to expand into some 
of the [other languages offered at 
CMU], he said. Ultimately it
We think students are beginning 
to see the value of developing pro
ficiency in another language and 
learning about another culture.
Crime and Incident Report
4/14 MEDICAL, 8:35 pm  While 
playing deck hockey on the floor of the 
tennis court, a CMU student struck his 
head on the door handle on the east side 
of the court. EMS treated the victim for 
his injury, and Campus Police trans
ported him to UPMC.
4/15 INDECENT EXPOSURE, 8:30 
pm  While sitting in the dining area on 
the second floor of the University Center 
near the swimming pool, a CMU student 
observed a male reading a newspaper. 
When she got up to leave, she saw that 
this man was masturbating. The victim 
then left the dining area, as did the 
actor. The victim reported the incident 
to Campus Police on the Carnival Mid
way and was still upset at the time. 
Campus Police asked if the victim wanted 
to speak with a counselor regarding this 
incident, and she declined.
4/15 ASSAULT, 10:30  While at a 
fraternity party on the CMU campus, two 
University of Pittsburgh students en
countered a male and a female in a 
stairway. The Pitt student reporting the 
incident stated that her friend was in
toxicated and loud, and the male seemed 
very annoyed with this behavior.
He began arguing with her, and when 
the complainant tried to intervene, the 
female pushed her. She turned to con
front this female, and the male grabbed 
her by the arm and tried to push her 
down the stairs. They left the area imme
diately thereafter. In her report to Cam
pus Police, she stated that she believed 
the male was intoxicated, and that she 
was concerned that her underage friend 
was served alcohol at the party.
4/16 FIGHT, 12:40 am  Campus Po
lice received a call that there was a fight 
in progress at a fraternity, and two offic
ers responded. Upon arrival, they en
countered a number of individuals push
ing and shoving each other. The respond
ing officers attempted to physically sepa
rate a black male whom they had wit
nessed pushing and shoving numerous 
white males. One officer yelled for every
one to stop and vacate the porch. The 
actor would not stop his actions or leave 
the porch. One of the officers placed a left 
hand upon his chest and told him to calm 
down and get off the porch. Upon this 
action, the actor screamed obscenities at 
the officer. The officer then stepped back 
and took out his asp (weapon), asking 
again that the actor get off the porch.
The actors friend, who was standing 
at the base of the wall of the porch, then 
yelled, Police brutality, he hit that 
nigger, he hit that nigger. The officer 
recognized the male as a former CMU 
student. He responded that he had not 
hit anyone and asked the former stu
dent to leave the scene.
The two actors then joined two other 
males, jumped over the porch wall, 
and vacated the area. City police were 
then notified.
After the incident, the officers gath
ered additional information about what
had happened. Apparently, the actor 
had been denied entry at the front door 
of the fraternity, and consequently, he 
jumped to the porch to enter the house. 
An unknown brother asked the actor to 
please leave the porch area. From that 
point on, the actors friend jumped the 
porch wall, and the two began to push 
several males who were in that area.
Although the officer had pulled out his 
asp, he did not strike anyone present.
4/16 MEDICAL, 5:01 pm  A CMU 
alumna came ^o the EMS trailer on the 
Carnival Midway, needing transporta
tion to the hospital. She stated that 
while on the Midway, something blew 
into her eye. An officer responded and 
took her to Presbyterian Hospital.
4/18 VANDALISM, 9:00 am  A 
Morewood Gardens resident contacted 
Campus Police to report that sometime 
in the past night, unknown person(s) 
had urinated on and torn down posters 
from her dorm room door. You are a 
bitch, and other derogatory remarks 
were also inscribed on her message 
board. The victims roommate stated 
that she heard some noises in the hall 
that night, but did not check to see if 
anyone was there. The victim was ad
vised to ask her neighbors if they had 
seen anything, and to contact Campus 
Police with any more information.
4/18 DISORDERLY CONDUCT,
7:54 pm  While driving on Morewood
Avenue, a CMU alumnas car was hit 
with what she believed to be a ping 
pong ball launched from the direction of 
a fraternity house. She called Campus 
Police on her cellular phone to report 
the incident. Upon the officers arrival, 
the victim stated that, while she was 
traveling south on Morewood Avenue, a 
CMU graduate student was down at 
the street retrieving what she believed 
to be a ping pong ball, and threw it at 
her car. The officer noticed at this time 
that there were multiple small white 
objects in the roadway.
Speaking with the house president, the 
officer learned that the brothers were 
engaged in a marshmallow battle on the 
houses porch. The house president also 
stated that he was not present during the 
whole time the battle ensued, at which 
time some of the marshmallows made 
their way to the street. The activities 
ceased at the officers warnings, and ev
eryone retreated into the house. Internal 
citations for disorderly conduct and pro
pulsion of missiles onto the roadway were 
issued to the fraternity.
4/20 ELEVATOR ENTRAPMENT,
4:46 pm  A CMU student became 
trapped in the Doherty Hall/Wean Hall 
elevator, and called a friend via cell 
phone. The friend then contacted Cam
pus Police, who responded to the scene. 
The elevator was stuck on the sixth floor 
of Wean Hall, and the victim said the 
inside doors were open. Elevator keys 
were obtained from the Campus Police
office, and the door was opened to permit 
extrication of the victim. The victim 
stated he was okay and declined medical 
attention. The elevator was placed out of 
service, and an elevator service com
pany was contacted for repair.
4/23 THEFT, 9:43 pm  A professor 
contacted campus police to report the! 
theft of four checks from his check book.
Mellon Bank was notified and the pro
fessor was advised to come in person. He 
went to the bank to stop payment of the 
four checks.
The desk where the checks were kept 
was not locked at the time of the theft, and 
the door did not show any signs of forced 
entry. The professor confirmed that noth
ing else was missing or disturbed.
 Campus Chief of Police James 
LaPaglia reviews all reports prior 
to release.
 Only three people on The Tartan staff 
see the reports: the Editor-in-Chief the 
News Editor, and the staffwriter typing 
the report.
 All personal names of complainants, 
victims, suspects, and fraternities are 
omitted from the printed report. Ethnic 
descriptions and other personal details

As the school year draws to a 
close, The Tartan takes a mo
ment to present Thistles and 
Thorns  a look back on the best 
and worst of the 1998-99 aca
demic year.
A thistle to all of the new con
struction taking place on campus 
 the brand-new Purnell Center 
for the Arts, and the additions to 
Building D, Baker Hall, and 
Posner Hall, all of which will pro
vide much-needed academic 
space. A thorn, however, to the 
powers that be for not making 
any future plans for new parking, 
and another thorn for ripping up 
grass everywhere, more than nec
essary for construction to proceed.
A thistle to the upcoming open
ing of the Morewood Basement, 
with food provided by Gulliftys 
Restaurant. For a long time, stu
dents have needed a place to hang 
out and enjoy good food in an 
atmosphere different from that 
of Skibo Coffeehouse. The 
Morewood Basement will provide 
such a place.
A thistle to President Cohons 
annual Town Meeting, which af
fords a chance for the adminis
tration to inform students about 
the goings-on of the University. 
But a thorn to the organizers of 
the Town Meeting for a poor job 
of advertising, causing poor at
tendance of the event.
A thorn to Student Government 
for their bevy of internal prob
lems earlier this semester and 
poor conduction of elections. A 
thistle, however, for asking for 
direct student input via email 
concerning the Wonder Boys re
turn to campus.
A thorn also to the Hollywood 
invasion itself: Wonder Boys was 
a huge inconvenience for CMU 
that never seemed to go away. 
While at first it was exciting to 
have a film shoot on campus, the 
interference with classes and 
Buggy practices that came with 
it soon became tiresome.
A big fat thorn to the adminis
tration for neglecting to have a 
Commencement speaker for 
graduation this year. The lack of 
a speaker from outside CMU de
tracts from the significance of 
the ceremony to the outgoing se
nior class.
A thistle to CMUs meetings 
with government officials in an 
effort to combat Y2K problems. 
CMU itself is well-prepared for 
the turn of the millennium, and 
the University has taken a pro
active role in ensuring that sys
tems everywhere will roll into 
the new year without a hitch.
A thistle to the referendum that 
solidified the deal between Port 
Authority Transit (PAT) and 
CMU. Using a referendum on 
this issue ensured that adminis
tration had students consent 
before levying the required fee. 
The deal itself also deserves a 
thistle, as it will allow students 
to use their IDs to ride PAT buses 
for free.
A thistle for the recent decision 
to build a new dorm on campus. 
A thorn, however, to choosing 
the grassy area behind Donner 
as the new location. Placing the 
dorm in this location robs CMU 
of another green area and elimi
nates a gathering place used com
monly by residents of Donner, 
Resnik, and West Wing for out
door activities.
A thistle to SDC and AB for 
consistently bringing the students 
enjoyable films every Thursday 
through Sunday. A thorn for the 
fact that weekend movies are the 
only thing that brings students 
out in large numbers.
A thorn to the HUB for the fall 
Schedule of Classes. The distri
bution of course times was in
convenient for many students, 
and the printed book lacks any 
sense of aesthetics or consider
ation for information design  
key elements like a table of con
tents are missing.
A thistle to AB Concerts for 
bringing Soul Coughing out for 
Spring Carnival, but a thorn goes 
to the dank Skibo Gym venue 
where the weather forced the con
cert to be held. Another thorn 
goes to the gym itself; muchneeded renovations still have not 
taken place.
A thorn to the tearing down of 
Pitt Stadium. The University of 
Pittsburgh administration has 
ignored students opinion on this 
matter, and the destruction of 
the stadium will hurt local ven
dors business. Furthermore, 
moving Pitts games out of Oak
land will discourage students 
from attending them, hurting 
school spirit.
A thistle to the addition of the 
e-commerce degree to the Gradu
ate School of Industrial Admin
istration curriculum. The new 
program is the first of its kind in 
the U. S.  another example of 
how CMU is on the cutting edge 
of technology and its applications.
A thorn to the first-year Inter
pretation and Argument intro
ductory writing classes. They are 
in need of restructuring: The syl
labus varies greatly between sec
tions; the graduate students who 
teach the class have too much 
control over content and grad
ing policies. A standard intro
ductory writing class required 
of most students should be just 
that  standard.
A thorn to the administration 
for failing to communicate with 
the student body about impor
tant matters on a regular basis. 
For example, changes were made 
last semester to Online Regis
tration without sufficient student 
input. More recently, students 
did not find out about the pur
chase of President Cohons new 
house until an article about it 
appeared in the Pittsburgh PostGazette. When the administra
tion fails to keep students up-todate on major events such as 
these, students become upset be
cause they werent involved in 
the decision-making process.
A thorn to the Bachelor of Hu
manities and Arts (BHA) pro
gram. Students are unsure about 
requirements and have no advi
sors to guide them. Currently, 
they often get conflicting mes
sages from CFA and H&SS re
garding courses and require
ments. The program needs a dean 
or centralized advisor  some
one to whom BHA students can 
go with their questions.
Finally, thistles to philanthro
pist Paul Mellon and former 
CMU president Richard Cyert, 
both of whom passed away dur
ing the past year, for all of their 
generosity, not only to the Uni
versity but to the entire Pitts
burgh community.

The lotterys popularity is incredible. 
Every evening, after the news, five or six 
colored plastic balls change the lives of 
millions of people forever. Millions of 
dollars rest on the roll of a round piece of 
colored plastic. Is it the absurdity of the 
situation that Americans love so much? 
Is it perhaps the idea that lives can 
change forever in a split second that 
appeals so much to us? Whatever reason 
people chose in rationalizing how astro
nomical odds are going to work out for 
them to the tune of millions of dollars, 
one thing is certain. The fascination 
with the lottery is no small event.
Just how big is the American publics 
fascination with the lottery? One, when 
you type the word lottery into the Ex
cite search engine on the Internet, how 
many hits do you think you get? 100 
hits? Maybe 10,000 hits? Not even close. 
There are almost 100,000 hits that di
rectly relate to the lottery. The sites 
subjects range from how to invest your 
new fortune, to lottery clubs, to the daily 
winning numbers for each state, even to 
investment groups that will pay you a 
structured cash settlement for your win
ning ticket.
Does anyone remember what hap
pened at seven oclock during the special 
news briefing about the bombings of 
Serbia? You guessed it  explanations 
of bombing patterns to be used by NATO 
warplanes were replaced with shining 
balls rolling out of a lottery machine. 
Not even war can stop the lotto.
Why is the lottery so popular? Simple. 
It is the ultimate escape plan for middleand working-class America. This past
summer, I worked at a glass factory; 
without a doubt, the most oft-repeated 
conversation began with these exact 
words, When I win the lotto tonight, Im 
going to buy a... (fill in with lavish home 
or expensive sports car, etc.). The es
cape from middleand working-class 
lives has previously been accomplished 
through years of hard work and a few 
lucky breaks along the way. The Ameri
can Dream, if you will. But think about 
this. Nobody really likes to work. This is 
especially true if you hate your job. If 
you can trade one dollar for the chance of 
living a life you will never otherwise be
LytSeN Wy9ttihsimSiN lmS WSiww
able to experience, it is easy to see why 
this seems to be a great investment. A 
dollar for a new and improved life: not a 
bad trade.
Everybody knows the American 
Dream, a beautiful tale inspired by hope
ful immigrants long ago. It goes some
thing like this: In America, everyone 
can get ahead, the streets are paved 
with gold, there are no difficulties if one 
is willing to work hard, and so on and so 
forth. In the 1920s, Ernest Hemingway, 
F. Scott Fitzgerald, and the rest of the 
Lost Generation writers challenged the

Many people have taken excep
tion to my bleeding-heart opin
ions, most notably those calling 
for stricter gun control and/or the 
outright banning of firearms. My 
detractors are quick to cite, among 
other things, my blatant hypoc
risy in the face of the fact that I 
possess licenses for and own a 
number of semi-automatic weap
ons and personal sidearms, along 
with an assortment of bladed 
weaponry. Apparently, it is the 
simplistic view of many that my 
antithetical actions somehow for
bid me from railing against the 
right to own guns.
Let me then begin by stating 
that there is absolutely nothing 
wrong with hypocrisy. It is one of 
those behaviors of which we have
been socialized into mindlessly 
disapproving. The hypocrite in 
an argument is universally de
cried  to end a rebuttal with So 
arent you being a hypocrite by 
saying such-and-such? fre
quently serves to effectively si
lence the opposition, regardless 
of the strength in his arguments 
alone. Perhaps owing to the un
fortunate Christian dictate of 
judge not, lest ye 
be judged, we 
have managed to 
bind our moral 
development to 
the shallowest of 
circles with this ^I 
fatuous standard. Is the truth 
any less true if the man who 
says it does not practice what 
he preaches?
Hypocrisy is almost universally 
considered to be morally wrong. 
And yet, in the entire history of 
the world, not one society has 
seen fit to draw up laws against
it. Why? Murder is similarly con
demned everywhere. It cant be a 
matter of scale  we have laws 
against defamation and libel as 
well as laws against taking a life. 
But hypocrisy appears to be the 
unpunished sin. And for good rea
son too, for one should not shrink 
from hypocrisy.
Consider: If I advocate certain 
policies or ideas, those ideas
Is the truth any less true if 
the man who says it does not 
practice what he preaches?
should be judged according to 
the reasons that support them, 
as all ideas are. It is the fallacy of 
the unprincipled and unfocused 
to say something like Well, of 
course you would say that! Look 
whos talking! as though the 
advocacy of a position beneficial 
to ones own interests somehow
automatically invalidates the 
idea itself. Similarly, the exten
sion of the same fallacy leads 
some to believe that if one acts in 
contradiction to ones beliefs, then 
those beliefs are somehow 
meritless. This is simply a sign of 
intellectual laziness, looking for 
any way to dodge a legitimate 
call to rethink an opinion, by 
citing that the critic
------doesnt do that himself.
Jesuss exhortation not to 
judge, lest ye be judged 
makes universal mediocrity 
the rule.
Perhaps a clearer example 
would be thus: Your father 
smokes. He knows smoking is 
unhealthy. He tells ycu not to 
smoke, yet continues to go 
through two packs a day him
self. Quite obviously, he is a 
hypocrite. But the condition of 
hypocrisy itself, a mere disso
nance between action and atti
tude, reflects nothing bad. You
shouldnt smoke because its un
healthy, and credit goes to your 
father for urging you not to, 
as well as fault for his own smok
ing. The disparity between his 
belief and his actions is of 
no consequence.
Hence, it remains imperative 
that we prepare ourselves to fight 
the impending alien invasion, 
despite, as one critic so acidly 
pointed out to me, the fact that I 
myself have been engaged in se
cret negotiations with the alien 
potentate to sell out our resis
tance forces at a crucial moment 
in return for an overseer posi
tion in the salt mines where the 
human race will toil away its 
last moments. You can call me a 
traitor, you can call me a sell-out, 
you can even call me a hypocrite. 
But remember, theres nothing 
wrong with that.

onym for Xerix the Merciless.

Recently, the Federal Communications 
Commission (FCC), in an effort to combat 
the dwindling number of owners of radio 
stations, proposed relaxing some of the 
rules on radio station licenses. Under the 
new plan, stations of less than 1,000 watts 
are allowed on the FM dial, even stations 
with 110-watt transmitters covering 
single neighborhoods. It is probable that 
the proposal will make these new stations 
non-commercial, which would lower setup 
and operating costs for the licensees.
Until June 1, the FCC is allowing citi
zens and organizations to submit public 
input. Most of the response has been posi
tive. Presumably, with the lower costs in
volved in starting and maintaining a lowpower FM (LPFM) radio station, more 
stations could spring up, offering a variety 
of programming not present in the arid 
plains of todays commercial radio. Not 
only can these micro-power stations play 
music outside of the mainstream, but pro
grammers could also provide news from 
alternative viewpoints, and communitylevel information that would be of little 
interest on a large metropolitan scale.
Of course, LPFM has its detractors. The 
main organization behind the fight against 
LPFM is the National Association of Broad
casters (NAB). This organization, which 
represents the vast majority of commer
cial radio stations in the U.S., does not 
wish to see unnecessary competition on 
the airwaves. The NABs argument against 
LPFM has three main components. First, 
increased competition will lower revenues 
for existing stations, while also hurting 
new stations. Second, the new rules will 
only encourage pirates instead of curtail
ing them. Third, the new stations will 
cause interference that could have been 
avoided otherwise.
The FCC has responded to the second 
and third issues. According to the FCC 
Web site, interference is not much of a 
concern. The low power of most stations, 
along with present station spacing rules, 
permits further expansion of the airwaves 
in most cities without interference. Also, 
the interference standards were created 
almost four decades ago, before the cre
ation of inexpensive digital receivers that
lock onto a discrete step of the frequency.
The Commission has also declared that 
LPFM will not encourage pirates. Those 
who wish to set up stations must be of good 
character; in other words, they must not 
have violated long-standing prohibitions 
against unlicensed broadcasting. How
ever, those who stopped operations after 
being merely warned by the FCC may be 
considered for licensing.
The first concern of the NAB  lowered 
revenues for existing stations  is prob
ably the most important to them. Since the 
deregulation of radio station ownership in 
1995, more radio stations are being con
trolled by fewer companies. According to 
the April 1999 Washington Monthly, 10 
companies controlled 600 of the 4,992 ex
isting stations in 1996. Now, four compa
nies control almost twice that, and two  
Jacor Communications and Clear Chan
nel  are merging.
By consolidating radio stations, the own
ers have figured out ways of increasing 
their profits. Probably the most obvious 
result of this is the increasing lack of 
choices on the dial. Most commercial sta
tions can be classified as alternative, rock, 
classic rock, adult contemporary, country, 
urban (rap and R&B), and news. The sta
tions that play music deliver that which is 
popular, and nothing more. The last thing 
commercial radio wants or needs is vari
ety and surprise.
Commercial radio has amazing upside 
potential: By playing only a few tracks, 
stations cut down on song licensing costs. 
Further, homogenizing stations leads to 
ease of advertising, since one ad can reach 
an entire market faster and cheaper; in
stead of developing spots for each station 
or market, companies can play one or two 
different advertisements on a network. 
However, the downside risk is quite high; 
if the stations do not play music that is 
instantly appealing, people will find an
other station. Stations with lower ratings 
receive less advertising revenue, which is 
the primary source of station profits.
Stations attract listeners by playing 
songs whose appeal has been thoroughly 
researched. The lists of current music con
tain very few, if any, surprises; stations 
will only play songs that have been tested 
through surveys and record sales. The 
industry is quite unapologetic about the 
lack of variety on the airwaves. The Feb
ruary 22,1999Radio Business Report listed 
lack of variety as one myth about commercial radio. The article stated that the 
homogenization was not a myth, but 
implied those in support of low-power 
FM want to play music that sound[s] 
like sick cats running over hot coals. 
While some of the music played on inde
pendent stations can sound unusual, 
even frightening, the implication that 
music which is new and different is all 
horrible is little more than grasping at 
straws for a justification to play the 
same three songs oyer and over.
LPFM, if planned and nurtured prop
erly, can give previously unheard voices 
a chance. Imagine hearing programave9 inmihsimSiN lmS WSiww 
ming on the FM dial in French, Arabic, 
Korean, or Urdu, speaking about topics of 
interest to the community. Or music that 
could be the next big trend, before it has 
been touched by the music industry. Or 
imagine turning on a radio station and 
hearing a human rights protest, or live 
religious services. While not everyone will 
agree with what the new stations will de
liver, the sheer variety has the potential to 
offer something for everyone.

DREAM, from page 6
reality of the American Dream 
with short stories and novels that 
detailed the failure and loss of 
men and women to make good in 
America. Later, in the 1950s, 
during the glory years of post
war prosperity in America, the 
rolling suburbs offered another 
version of the American Dream. 
This time, the Dream was chal
lenged by the Beatniks: Jack 
Kerouac, Allan Ginsberg, Will
iam S. Burroughs, and Neal 
Cassidy, among others. Leave it 
to literary movements to screw 
up anything. This time, the ob
jection to society was to its banal
ity and conformity. Then came 
the turmoil of the 60s, and the 
American Dream has never fully 
recovered. That is, until lotto fe
ver hit America.
The lottery has replaced hard
work and getting ahead as the 
perfect American Dream. No one 
is really dying to go out and 
work from nine to five every 
day. Seriously, how many of you 
jump out of bed in the morning, 
eager to start the day? Do you 
know anyone who gets up 
and races to a cluster to begin 
working, because they just 
cant stand sleeping in? Neither 
do I. Thats where the lottery 
comes in. All I have to do is buy 
the right ticket, sit back, and 
watch the money roll in. That 
is what is so beautiful about 
the lottery. There is absolutely 
no work on my part, 
aside from picking a few num
bers. All I have to do then is play 
untill win. And being particu
larly deficient in my 
understanding of statistics, 
I can rationalize that if I play
a lot, Ill surely win.
So there you have it. My scien
tific and in-depth explanation 
of why people play the lottery? 
To get rich. My insightful reason
ing as to why people would like 
to be rich? Its more fun than 
being poor or having to work. 
And my mind-boggling formula 
detailing how you can win 
the lottery: Play until you win. 
Good luck with your lottery 
picks. Man, my head hurts; you 
know, if I won the lottery, I 
wouldnt have to worry about a 
career in writing.
John Hursh is a sophomore 
creative writing and philosophy 
major. His lucky lotto numbers 
are 4, 9, and 13. When 
he wins the lottery, he plans to 
buy back his soul. Hes sure that 
it will go cheap.

Sigma Alpha Epsilon, Yeung still 
finds time to practice three or 
four times a week. I like hanging 
out with my friends and I have a 
lot of stuff to do at the fraternity, 
but I usually find time to prac
tice, he said. If I have to, I just 
adjust my practice schedule dur
ing the week.
Yeungs usual practice sched
ule is from 11 pm until midnight 
on Mondays, Wednesdays, and 
Fridays in Skibo Gym. An agree
ment with the Athletic Depart

to the Athletic Department, and 
they were really receptive, he 
said. They help fund my travel 
to tournaments and want to work 
to find other people who want to 
shoot too.
So far this year, Yeung hasnt 
had any problems with finding 
time to practice and travel to the 
different events, but suffered 
through a disappointing perfor
mance at the U.S. Indoor Cham
pionships. That was pretty ugly, 
Yeung said of his 15th-place fin
ish. The U.S. Outdoors are two 
weeks after finals in Lansing, 
Michigan, and the score there 
combined with the score at In
doors is your overall score. The 
top 10 scores are the years AllAmericans. I still have a pretty 
decent chance, but well see.
In the future, Yeung hopes to 
be able to keep shooting at a 
highly competitive level, but 
admits that it will take a 
large commitment. I want to
keep shooting, but I have to 
keep performing to keep my 
sponsors, he said. It can be 
boring at times, so I dont spend 
time fooling around when 
Im practicing.
Yeung also gives archery les
sons to local students, both 
young and old, over the sum

Jersey. His next competition 
will be the U.S. Outdoor Cham

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon University  26 April 199911Lack of scoring causes problems for NBA
The Basketball Beat
by Pete Patterson
One of the most exciting as
pects of sports is watching records 
being broken. Last seasons home 
run chase between Mark 
McGwire and Sammy Sosa 
showed the truth of this, with the 
whole nation transfixed by home 
run mania. Unbeknownst to 
many, the NBA has seen several 
record-breaking or tying perfor
mances already this season, al
beit of a different sort.
April 10 was a milestone day, 
as the Chicago Bulls scored 49 
points and made 18 field goals  
in the entire game. Both of these 
marks set new records in futility. 
To add some perspective, remem
ber that Michael Jordan scored 
at least 50 points by himself 37 
different times in his playing days 
for the Bulls, which now seem 
painfully long ago.
These record-breaking perfor
mances are not limited to the
Bulls, however. Golden State 
matched the record for the fewest 
points scored in the fourth quar
ter, with six. The New York 
Knicks, never liking to be out
done, earned a place in the record 
books by tying the low-water 
mark of five points scored in the 
second quarter. A team being shut 
out for an entire quarter does not 
seem too unlikely these days. I 
have my money on the Clippers 
becoming the first to accomplish 
this feat.
The NBA has always prided 
itself on being FAN-tastic, but 
several aspects of the game have 
raised concern about the future 
popularity of the league. The 
recent lockout certainly hurt 
the image of the league, which 
is bound to happen any time 
someone making over $10 
million a year  Patrick 
Ewing  claims the players 
are negotiating to be able to 
keep food on the table. Off the 
court, the myriad of run-ins 
of many NBA stars with the 
law and the constant saga that 
is Dennis Rodman cannot 
please many fans. And, with the 
retirement of Michael Jordan, 
the league has no true mar
quee player to lean on to carry 
the league.
Surprisingly, however, the 
league has actually seen an 
increase in attendance this 
year. The above problems 
have been blown out of pro
portion. Players legal 
troubles have become so 
common that many 
fans have been dead
ened to the effect, and if 
Bill Clinton can be presi
dent, who are we to judge 
some guys who play bas
ketball? The retirement of 
Jordan has been offset by the 
influx of several young, talented 
players, such as Vince Carter 
and Jason Williams, to fill the 
nightly highlight reels. Why 
the lockout didnt 
aliengreat traditions of this coun
try. Thus, when this oppor
tunity was taken away, 
people were offended and 
slow to forgive. The game of 
basketball, however, is seen as 
just that, a game. People attend 
to be entertained, and when the 
option was not 
available, other 
modes of en
tertainment 
easily took 
its place.
GgmWOguuvmhsimSiN lmS WSiww 
ate the fans as was the case in 
baseball after the 1994 strike is 
more of a mystery, but it can be 
figured out. Baseball is the na
tional pastime, and people take 
the game seriously. Going to the 
ball park on a beautiful summer 
day to soak in the sights of the 
freshly cut grass and the smell of 
ballpark hot dogs is one of the
This 
also ex
plains the 
NBAs tenuous 
current position. The 
game relies on entertain
ment, and, due to the low 
scores, is becoming less and less 
entertaining. A description of an 
average possession goes like this: 
point guard dribbles the ball up,
passes to the wing, who dumps 
the ball down low. Big man stands 
with ball for five seconds, draws a 
double team, kicks the ball out to 
the wing, who then clangs a 
twenty footer off the back iron. 
The other team rebounds, only to 
start the same mind-numbing 
cycle again. Numbers are down 
across the league, not just in a 
few record-breaking instances. 
Not a single team in the league is 
averaging 100 points per game, 
with the Kings leading the league 
at 99.6. The wide-open, high-scoring days of the mid-to-late 80s 
are a distant memory. Who can 
forget the great 1986-87 season, 
at the height of the Lakers 
Showtime era? In that years fi
nals, between the Lakers and the 
Celtics, the winning team scored 
at least 106 in every 
game, with the Lakers scoring as 
many as 141. Michael Jordan 
finished the season with an aver
age of 37.1 points a game, the 
highest since 1963.
There are several pos
sible explanations for 
the current lack of 
scoring. Rust from 
the lockout has been 
suggested, but as this 
season has merely continued a 
recent trend, this can only be a
partial reason. The rash of play-, 
ers entering the league with little, 
or no college experience has hurt; 
the fundamental development ofj 
many would-be stars. There has! 
undoubtedly been an increase in! 
the emphasis on playing defense,; 
which is the biggest reason for 
the decrease in scoring. Pat Rileycoached teams are a perfect ex
ample of this phenomenon, as his 
80s Lakers teams were up-tempo, 
high-scoring, and thrilling to; 
watch. Rileys current team, the; 
Miami Heat, relies on solid de
fense, with players such as Alonzo! 
Mourning and Dan Majerle hold-! 
ing opponents to an NBA low; 
83.2 points per game.
Whatever the reason, some^ 
thing needs to be done to increase 
scoring. Commissioner David 
Stern has said the league will; 
look into ways to increase scor
ing, so look for some rule changes; 
to take place this off-season. If; 
this problem is not solved soon,; 
the league could be in trouble. No; 
matter how much a fan loves 
this game, only so many 75-701 
games can be tolerated.
Pete Patterson is a sophomore 
IDS major who could 
singlehandedly bring scoring 
back up if he got a chance.Writer cries Take me out to the ball game
rhiBall
by Matt Brun
As you may have noticed, last weeks 
installment of Play Ball was a rather 
heavy unburdening of my complaints 
about the current state of baseball. With 
that off my chest, I decided that I should 
end the semester on a lighter note. With 
that in mind, I present my reasons base
ball is the national pastime.
One-hundred and sixty-two games a 
year  Missed the game last night? 
Dont worry about it, theres another 
one tonight, and tomorrow, and theyre 
all against the same team! Baseball 
is unique among professional sports in 
that teams play a series rather than a 
single game, adding lots of quirks to the 
season. A series sweep generates inter
est even early in the season, a time 
when other sports struggle to get atten
tion. Also, if you think a late-season 
game between teams battling for a play
off spot is important, consider a fourgame series between teams in a 
pennant race. One weekend can com
pletely change the outlook of the entire 
season for both teams.
Managers wearing uniforms  This 
has actually been a topic of controversy 
in recent years, but personally, I 
love it. Sure, theyre out of shape and fill 
out the jersey a great deal, but with the 
uniform on, theyre a part of the team. 
Coaches in expensive suits stand out 
from the rest of the team as if theyre 
trying to make themselves seem 
more important. Sure, coaches and 
managers deserve loads of respect 
for what they do, but its the players 
that win he game. I dont think Id 
like to see any current NBA coaches 
wearing their teams uniforms, but 
for baseballs simple uniforms, 
it works.
Umpires  Come on, admit it, deep 
down you have to love these guys. 
First off, they take a lot of crap from 
everybody. Whether they deserve 
it or not, the umps are going to 
upset someone on just about ev
ery call, and theres nothing 
better than watching a 
manager kick dirt at ^ the
ump. Then theres t h
home plate ump. Each one
has their own way of signaling
balls and strikes, and some of them 
really get into it. Ive seen a plate umpire 
almost fall down calling a strike out; 
you just dont see things like that in 
other sports.

mustard, but you have to 
give credit to a product that

cation in the whole country.
Plus, this is my column,
Matt Blum/
simSiN lmS 
WSiww
and since 
Im from the 
Cleveland area, I had to 
mention it, but I think Id 
better drop the subject now.
Moving on....
Double headers  Double head
ers have been phased out of the game 
in the past few years, except as ways to 
make up rain-outs, and they need to be 
brought back. This is baseball played all 
day long, the way you play in the park 
with your friends. They are also another
of the countless features unique to base
ball, which brings me to my next point.
Baseball purists  Love em or hate 
em, you have to respect the dedication 
of the true baseball purists. These people 
want the game to be exactly the same 
leaving the 20th century as it was enter
ing it. Every single proposed change, no 
matter how seemingly insignificant, 
ticks these people off and opens a 
huge debate before the change is 
made anyway. Now thats loyalty. 
The American League vs. the Na
tional League  Before the advent of 
inter-league play, these two entities 
were as separate as can be. They are 
still completely different organizations 
with different sets of rules that have 
teams in the same city that never play 
each other. They go through their own 
seasons independent of the other, each 
crowning its own champion that then 
battles for the right to be called World 
Champion (which is still a typical Ameri
can overstatement, but well let that go 
for now).
History  Every professional sport 
has its own history that it can be 
deservedly proud of, but baseballs 
is special. There are baseball 
records still standing that were 
set back in the 1800s; lets see 
any other sport top that.
The blend of teamwork and one-on-one 
competition  Whether or not the rising 
superstars of today think so, basketball,
like all other professional sports, is a 
team game. Despite all the effort the 
crews and mechanics putin, auto racing 
boils down to one driver versus all the 
others. Baseball is the lone sport thali 
blends the two forms of competition into 
one fluid combination. Each play starts 
out as a classic one-on-one confrontation 
be-tween pitcher and batter. Once the 
balls in play, though, the pitcher has to 
rely on the rest of the team to help get 
the out, and, unless he homers, the hit
ter has to rely on the rest of his team to 
bring him home.
The minor-league system Yes, I know 
the NHL has a minor league system, too, 
but that one is not nearly as exciting as 
the one employed by major league base
ball. For starters, each big-league club 
has four minor league affiliations to 
bounce players around in. You can per
fectly track the progress of a hot rookie 
without even seeing the numbers hes 
putting up just by checking which league 
hes in. Over the course of a long season; 
positions change rapidly, too. If a player 
goes down with an injury or gets traded, 
suddenly theres a minor-leaguer with 
his shot at the big time. He may not stay 
more than a couple days, but if he per: 
forms well in a late-season call-up, theres 
a good chance hell be on the roster come 
next spring. All in all, the minor league 
system is a solid way to weed out draft-; 
day busts. Prospective stars may have to

Outside of the typical events 
| like football and basketball,
; sports dont get much recognition 
I from the student body at CMU.
' For dedicated athletes like firstyear business administration 
I major Bryan Yeung, however, the 
! thrill of competition is what 
makes participatingworthwhile, 
i even if no one knows about it.
For the past four years, Yeung 
has been a competitive archer,
I participating in many local and 
national tournaments. For such 
 a short career, he has already 
\ experienced a very high level of 
| success, becoming one of the high!; est-ranked amateur shooters in 
. the country.
Most people might consider 
{ archery a rather esoteric sport 
with a limited number of com; petitors, but for Yeung it was 
! commonplace. I had friends who 
; did it, and they introduced me to 
; the sport, he said.
As time passed, however, those 
{ same friends abandoned the 
; sport, leaving Yeung alone to 
' see how far he could take it. Most 
of my friends dropped out, but 
| I kept going, he said. I noticed 
 that not many Asian kids 
did archery, and I wanted to 
change that.
Having made the decision to 
begin competing more actively, 
Yeung never looked back, receiv
ing the full support of his parents 
to pursue his goals. My parents 
really supported me, he said. 
They got me a really nice bow for 
my 14th birthday.
Making the jump to competi
tive shooting, Yeung made an 
impact right off the bat, winning 
the New Jersey State Champion
ships in both 1994 and 1995. In 
95, he stepped up another level, 
finishing 12th at the U.S. Indoor 
Field Shooting Championships 
held in Tulsa, Oklahoma. That 
competition was a real milestone 
for me in my decision to keep 
going ahead with this, he said.
After taking a year off to focus 
more on his schoolwork, Yeung 
returned to competition in 97 
even stronger than before. It was 
at that point that Yeung switched 
from the casual setting of field 
archery to the more professional 
world of Junior Olympic archery. 
Field archery is more casual; it 
teaches the fundamentals of ar
chery and stresses consistency. 
Junior Olympic archery is the 
more traditional target shooting, 
he said. Its a lot more challeng
ing, ... and I thought there was 
more potential for success there. 
1997 was also a slow year for 
Yeung as he acclimatized him
self to the different form of com
petition. Ninety-seven was ayear 
I was still building a foundation 
for myself, he said.
One year of adjustment would 
prove to be all the time that Yeung 
needed, however, as he stormed 
back into the top of the rankings 
in 98. In his first major competi
tion of the year, Yeung set a state 
record at the New Jersey Junior 
Olympic Indoor Championships, 
and he was just getting warmed 
up. Later in theyear, he took fifth 
at the U.S. Indoor Nationals to 
qualify for the Junior World Tri
als and a shot at the Junior World 
Archery Championships. Yeung 
finished sixth at the trials, miss
ing the world championships.
At the U.S. Outdoor Nationals 
that same year, Yeung earned a 
sixth-place finish despite shoot
ing with an injured shoulder. The 
sixth-place result left Yeung one 
position short of earning a spot 
on the Junior Elite Team. De
spite the two near-misses, 1998 
was not without its high points 
for Yeung. His score at the U.S. 
Open set a world record for under-18 shooters, and he teamed 
with a friend to win the Atlantic 
City Internationals two-man 
team division.

ing up his studies and his resPlease see ARCHERY, page 9

with two disappointing losses, the

of its best records in recent

game worth of offense.
years, earninga berth in the 
ECAC playoffs.
Even with a new coach and a roster full of underclassmen, the womens 
soccer team had one of their best seasons ever.
Despite seeming to have hit 
bottom, the team had an ex
tremely difficult task ahead of 
them both in adjusting to a young 
team and new coach and improv
ing on the 1997 seasons disap
pointments. By most accounts, 
the Tartans were able to pull the 
feat off, and are now poised to 
make some noise both in the re
gion and the UAA in the 1999 
season. The team is by no means 
satisfied by this years perfor
mance, and will look to continue 
to improve in years to come.
The 8-9 record in 1998 was 
enough to propel the Tartans from 
last in the UAA in 1997 to fifth in 
1998, and, a loss to Brandeis 
in the final game of the season 
notwithstanding, the team felt 
that they peaked right at the end 
of the season. The game plan for
Much of the teams offense came 
from the footwork of senior Harry 
Ulrich, who contributed 42 points 
to the Tartan offense and was 
among the top five scoring leadthroughout the season. Unfortu
nately, no one else on the team 
was able to score consistently, 
causing problems on the rare oc
casions when the opposition was 
able to shut down Ulrich.
The main challenge of the 1999 
season will be to overcome the 
loss of Ulrich and Brody, who are 
the teams only graduating se
niors. Given the youth and'experience of the 1998 team, the Tar
tans seem poised to move among 
the leaders in both the ECAC 
and the UAA.
Volleyball
record: 23-13
One would be hard pressed to 
believe that the 1998 edition of 
the Tartan womens volleyball 
team was only one year removed 
from the 1997 squad. The im
provement was almost mind-bog
gling  from a losing record one 
year to a 10-games-above-.500 
finish in 1998, the team moved 
up a notch both in level of play 
and respect from other clubs.
This improvement was most 
embodied at the LaRoche Tour
nament on October 24. In 1997, 
the teams season peaked at the 
tournament, as they pulled of a 
first-place finish in rally scoring. 
In 1998, they were mad that they 
didnt sweep every team, drop
ping one game and settling for 
second place.
If there were any disappoint
ments in the season, it was at the 
UAA Championships, which were 
held in the CMU University Cen
ter. After extremely tough play 
and nail-biting action, the Tar
tans settled for a second straight 
sixth-place finish. Every team 
needs something to play for next 
season, however, and number one 
on the list of priorities for 1999 
will most likely be avenging the 
1998 UAA finish.
Football
record: 73
There are very few teams in 
college football that would con
sider a 7-3 record to be a disap
pointment. For the Tartans, how
ever, the year didnt live up to the 
high standards of Carnegie
Mellon football under head coach 
Rich Lackner.
Despite going 3-1 in the UAA, 
that one heartbreaking loss ver
sus the University of Chicago in 
the CMU Homecoming game on 
October 17 proved to be 
all the Bears needed to unseat 
the defending champion Tar
tans as top gun in the UAA. 
That 9-7 loss, combined with a 
21-20 opening-day loss to 
Denison University, showed the 
team and its fans how critical 
every point can be in college 
football standings.
The 1999 edition of the Tar
tans will have to overcome the 
loss of seniors like defensive 
back Jason Funke, runningback 
Bryan Krueger, and tight end 
Chris Barnicle. The 1999 sea
son will also see the culmina
tion of two or three years of 
experience with incoming se
niors like quarterback Russ 
Clay or Mike Monsilovich, who 
was among the UAAs leading 
running backs for 1998. This 
core of experienced players will 
serve to position the team for 
another run at the UAA crown.

Mens Basketball
record: 5-20
The 1998-99 season was a re
building process for the CMU 
mens basketball team. With a 
roster featuring nine first-year 
players, lack of experience was a 
problem the Tartans faced all 
season long.

into a UAA contender by meeting their goal of ten wins this season.

Without a dominant runner to depend on, the mens track and field

women: 4th place NCAA Di
vision III national finish 
How do you follow up a top ten 
national ranking in 1997? For 
the womens cross country team, 
the answer was to do it again. 
The Tartan women captured 
fourth place, and the CMU men 
followed close behind, taking 
14th place in the NCAA Division 
III championship meet at 
Dickinson College.
The key to success all season 
for both the men and women was 
a core group of incredibly focused 
and dedicated runners. Seniors 
Margaret Powers and Maureen 
McGranaghan led the women and 
captured All-American status for 
their efforts. Seniors Kristo 
Kriechbaum and Bryan Meyer, 
along with junior Ken Oldham, 
headlined a mens team that head 
coach Gary Meckley takes pride 
in calling a smart, strategic 
group of runners.
The question of whether the 
teams will be able to counter the 
losses of key seniors next year 
remains to be answered, but with 
a solid group of runners coming 
up through the ranks and the 
experience of Meckley and
through the first few games of 
the season. Just a few weeks into 
the season, however, things went
row to drop to last in the UAA 
standings. After breaking out of 
that slide, the team ended the 
season on a down note, losing 
their last game.
All season long, the team de
pended heavily on the leadership 
of senior guard Tommy Praesel 
and junior forward Brad McNutt. 
The two accounted for most of the 
teams scoring throughout the 
season, with varying support from 
the rest of the team.
Praesel finished his CMU ca
reer just two points short of a 
milestone 1000, good enough for 
15th on the Tartans all-time list. 
He was rewarded with an honor
able mention to the all-UAA team 
for his efforts.
Womens Basketball
record: 11-14
The Tartans continued to im. 
prove on recent years, meeting 
their goal of 10 wins and just 
missing finishing the year with a 
winning record. With seven-jun
iors and only one senior on this 
years roster, next years team 
will be loaded with experience 
and should be even stronger.
Despite not having a true scorer 
to lead the team game in and 
game out, the Tartans remained 
competitive all season long with 
strong teamwork and hustle. The 
biggest weakness for the team 
was an inability to handle heavy 
defensive pressure  a trait 
which was exploited in most of 
the teams losses.
Down the stretch, sophomore 
guard Lauren Petruzzi carried 
the team, leading the Tartans in 
scoring in almost every game in 
the second half of the season. A 
loss to UAA rival Emory Univer
sity in the last game of the season 
dropped the team to fourth in the 
conference final standings, 
behind Emory and runaway 
leaders New York University 
and Washington University of 
St. Louis.
Swimming
record:
men: 3rd in UAA 
women: 3rd in UAA

their explosive development into
The track and field teams had a rough lead-in to the UAA
decidedly south. A four-game 
skid dropped the teams record to 
3-9, and they were never able 
to recover.
After splitting their next four 
games, the team dropped six in a

the UAA. Continuing the trend of 
consistent improvement shown

GSIA prepares for millenium
School celebrates fifty years
Alumni, faculty recount history
ByASEEM S. GUPTA
Tartan Features Editor
Fifty years ago GSIA opened 
its doors and has since become 
one of Americas finest and 
most innovative business 
schools. After a 1948 grant of 
$6 million from the W.L. and 
Mary T. Mellon Foundation, 
GSIA became a reality in 1949 
with a class of six students 
taught by a faculty of seven. 
In keynote presentations, as 
part of GSIAs 50th anniver
sary celebrations last Friday 
afternoon, Herbert A. Simon, 
the schools first associate 
dean, and William W. Cooper,
one of GSIAs first professors, 
spoke of some of the history of 
GSIA, which gave the audience 
an interesting first hand 
account from two of the 
schools founding faculty.
The anniversary of the 
founding of the GSIA provides 
an opportunity for reflection 
on what was accomplished and 
for perspective on how the 
activities of the school related 
to the world in those times, 
said Cooper.
Simon said that unlike other 
business schools, GSIA chose 
to be proactive rather than 
reactive. Because GSIA was 
proactive, according to Simon,
the school was able to play an 
influential role in changing 
business schools across the 
world. The major thrust in the 
new GSIA was in developing 
the new decision making tools, 
usually called operations 
research, said Simon.
Throughout the last fifty 
years, GSIA has worked to 
build its faculty and student 
base to a level which has 
allowed it to become competi
tive with Americas best busi
ness schools. In 1951-52 GSIA 
had 18 students, and by 1987 
the school had 138 full-time 
students. Part of the reason

Last Friday the Graduate 
School of Industrial 
Administration was celebrating 
its 50th anniversary with an 
entire weekend of celebrations, 
including the Roof Breaking 
ceremony and the Electronic 
Commerce Luncheon. The cere
mony took place last Friday
afternoon at the entrance of 
Posner Hall to celebrate the 
construction of a new third floor 
for Posner. Construction will 
begin in June. [The new third 
floor] represents a powerful 
statement about the health of 
this school and its plans for the 
future, said President Jared 
Cohon to an audience of gradu
ate students, staff, and faculty.
To celebrate, guest speakers 
such as Rachel Mellon Walton, 
Pittsburgh Mayor Tom Murphy, 
,and Herr Tilman Todenhofer 
of the Robert Bosch Institute all 
spoke to congratulate the school 
on its successful 50 years and 
its bright future ahead.
CMU is shaping the economy 
of western Pennsylvania like 
nothing has shaped it since a
hundred years ago when the; 
raw materials came out of the: 
ground, said Murphy in his call; 
for the school to keep on its; 
expansions.
Although there was no actual; 
roof breaking, speakers were; 
presented with honorary hardhats and hammers and there; 
was an unveiling of the model of 
the prospective floor. It was 
then followed by the arrival of 
the ROTC marchers and the

Red and black banners attached to streetlights 
along Forbes Avenue indicate the upcoming fes
tivities of the Universitys centennial. Last week
end provided an opportunity for another impor
tant campus milestone, however: the 50th 
Anniversary of the Graduate School of Industrial 
Administration (GSIA).
About 500 GSIA alumni  over 10 percent of 
the total alumni population  came Taack to the 
school to celebrate for different reasons. For some 
graduates, it was time for their class reunion. For 
others, it was simply a way to reunite themselves 
with the school and revisit all of its accomplish
ments during its relatively short halfcentury history.
Even though the commemoration lasted only 
two days, the schedule of events was loaded from
9 am into the night on both Friday and Saturday. 
The first morning began with some lectures by 
GSIA faculty and staff, but the afternoon fea
tured a lavishly celebrated milestone: the Roof 
Breaking ceremony for the third-floor addition 
to Posner Hall. This new area will house new 
faculty offices, PhD students, staff offices, 
meeting and seminar rooms, and the Carnegie 
Bosch Institute.
It is as obvious as anything that Ive ever seen 
that the key ingredients to Pittsburghs future 
are the raw materials that are coming from the 
universities, and CMU is pre-eminent in that, 
said Tom Murphy, mayor of Pittsburgh. It is 
the research being done here that is driving 
our economy.

Director Curtis Hanson has been 
filming The Wonder Boys at Carnegie 
Mellon since February. Hanson most 
recently directed L.A. Confidential, for 
which he won an Oscar. Hanson and 
his crew concluded fdming at CMU on 
Sunday Evening.
The Tartan: Why did you choose to 
film at Carnegie Mellon and in 
Pittsburgh?
Curtis Hanson: What drew us to 
Pittsburgh is the fact that the novel by 
Michael Chabon was set in Pittsburgh. 
When I first read the script I thought 
that the film could be done in any east
ern city. I came to Pittsburgh and real
ly liked what I saw and I thought it was 
a unique environment to tell this story 
and indeed to work in. There is a lot of 
opportunities visually in Pittsburgh. It 
was the first decision and I think prob
ably the best decision I made on this 
project. CMU as a location is just a 
matter of what looked and felt right for 
our characters and it is a beautiful 
campus and like the city it has a lot of 
its archetectural integrity still in place, 
which appeals, to me and the 
camera man.
TT: Is there a particular aspect of 
the campus?
CH: Just like the city of Pittsburgh, 
the city has some unfortunate archi
tectural blunders that were made, but 
there are still great old buildings here 
that are unique to our environment, 
like the one that were talking in, and 
Baker where we set a classroom.
TT: Hows your experience been at 
CMU? Hows it been as a location?
CH: Its been great, the challenge of 
being here in Pittsburgh is the winter 
and the winter aspect of it, but other 
than that the city, the people the people 
of the city and the people of the campus
Forever Plaid.
have been great.
TT: Are there some particular 
challenges that present themselves 
in acity like Pittsburgh and on a 
college campus?
CH: Not on a college campus. A col
lege campus is just a very inviting envi
ronment physically. When we came 
over from our first location over by 
Margaret Morrison over to here, I was 
thinking how lucky the kids are to be
learn in college  it was more some
thing you learn by doing and by 
lifes experiences.
TT: What movie did you last see?
CH: I havent seen anything during 
the months Ive been working on this 
picture. The last one that I really liked 
was A Celebration, the Danish picture.
TT: What are your plans for 
after Wonder Boys? Do you think 
youre going to write a screenplay any49einvSO Wu9m9Mi09thsimSiN rOgSg 4MeSgm 
Curtis Hanson discussed his experience filming in Pittsburgh.
going to school here. I wish Id gone to 
a place like this. It is so inviting visu
ally. As far as the location  location 
work is always challenging, but I love it 
because I like movies that take advan
tages of specific locations and use them 
in the telling of a story. I always try to 
do that  try to fashion the story in 
such a way that it really takes advan
tage of a particular location.
TT: Where did you go college?
CH: I actually didnt go to college. I 
dropped out of high school. I knew 
what I wanted to do, which was write 
and hopefully direct movies. My back
ground as a reader made me feel that 
writing wasnt something that I would
time soon?
CH: One hopes to find another story 
that I like as much as I like this one, 
with characters that I care about as 
much as I care about these characters. 
What that is specifically and where it 
will take me, I dont know. That uncer
tainty is part of what I like about doing 
what I do. I have ideas of things I want 
to do at some point, but specifically I 
dont know whats next.
Ill always write. I like working from 
other peoples material, but I also like 
writing, and Ill always do that.
TT: How has your Academy Award 
affected your work and your life?
CH: Not at all, that Im aware of. It
was a big thrill, winning it. It was a 
bigger thrill, frankly, when Kim 
Basinger won her award, because I felt 
that was an award for all of the actors 
in the movie. Its really gratifying, but 
it doesnt change ones perspective of 
what one has to do.
TT: What sort of advice would you 
give to students at CMU who are; 
interested in filmmaking, directing,; 
or writing?
CH: If you look at it objectively, its arr 
impossibly hard struggle to become a 
filmmaker, because there are so many; 
people who want to do it, compared to 
the number of opportunities there are* 
People come from all walks of life and' 
manage to succeed in doing it, and each: 
one finds their own way that works:. 
The only advice I can give is, dont give: 
up. Be true to why you wanted to do it 
in the first place, because that is what, 
will make you unique and give you! 
something that is different from every--' 
body else who wants to do it. Im 
always an optimist; I always say that 
Im not aware of really good scripts 
that havent been made into pictures, 
and nobody cares where that really 
good script comes from. You dont need 
a degree from a college; you dont need 
a connection with the producer; you 
just have to be able to write a really 
good script and be smart enough to find 
a way to get somebody to read it.
Steve Culvers, for example, who 
wrote the script for this picture, came 
to Hollywood with no connections. He 
got a job as a messenger at an agency 
driving around scripts, and he started 
writing. His job gave him the insight to 
know what to do with the script when 
he finished it  just give it to some
body that he was dropping off other 
scripts for.
You just have to be creative and find 
a way, but the first thing is, you have to 
have something that other people are 
going to want.

Even though Popsicle sticks, magic 
markers, and Elmers Glue might be 
considered low-tech in todays art 
world, upon entering the current exhib
it at the UC Gallery and seeing such 
materials, one is quickly reminded of 
the fact that CMU is located in Mr. 
Rogerss neighborhood.
The show, entitled Week of the 
Young Child, was a joint effort by the 
Cyert School and the Childrens School 
in celebration of the National Week of 
the Young Child. Both of the schools, 
which are located on campus, have 
attempted to demonstrate the learning 
processes of children through their sep
arate projects. In addition to the 
numerous student artworks, the walls 
are covered with diagrams, explana
tions, and summaries of the projects.
Preschoolers and kindergartners from 
the Childrens School exhibited their 
studies of the city with mixed media 
sculptures and drawings. [Our curricu
lum] focuses on themes, said Sharon 
Carver, director of the Childrens School. 
We decided to do The City because it 
relates to Pittsburgh, and [the students] 
are familiar with it. The preschool did 
the 3-D cities that are sitting on wire 
frames. Kindergartners did the work on 
the walls.
The 3-D cities include the expected 
buildings, parks, and Pittsburgh 
bridges, as well as alienesqUe crea
tures and abstractions. While these 
things are sitting here, theres more. 
Theyre reading about cities. We try to 
connect for them  by the time 
theyre in kindergarten, theyre mak
ing their own maps, said Carver as 
she pointed to a felt map on the wall 
made by a group of students. The map 
portrays the trip that they made from 
the school, which is located in 
Margaret Morrison, to the gallery. We 
have specific learning goals that were 
trying to meet. [The exhibit] shows 
pictures, said Carver.
Both schools chose to include pho
tographs of their students during the 
process. [The show] is a way of learn
ing about children  their thought 
process, said Jennifer Azzariti, the 
Grable Foundation Atelierista-inResidence at the Cyert School. [Its] 
not only what they made, but how 
they made [the projects] and the 
process. I was listening to how the 
children were learning, she said. Its 
really based on our activities.
The students from the Cyert School, 
who range from infants to kindergart
ners, utilized clay. Each age group was 
given a poster along with space to 
exhibit their final projects. The 
younger children were shown molding
and touching the clay in the pictures 
that accompany their final clay prod
ucts. The older children complicated 
the process with wires and more com
plex ideas. [Clay] is a language like 
movement and music, said Azzariti.
We dont really see [the clay pro
jects] as art. Thats a misconception, 
said Charity Bare Schmiedl, the edu
cational coordinator of Cyerts kinder
garten and the liaison for the 
Atelierista. We want to show the 
strategies and that [the work evolved 
from a] whole series process. The clay
cacti which were done by the kinder
garten class, for example, were con
nected to the class pet, a bearded 
dragon. They were concerned that 
[the dragon] was lonely. So, they 
made a backdrop scene around 
his environment.
Carver also agrees with the idea of 
the process being more important 
than the final product. [Our show] is 
all part of a bigger picture, she said. 
We use a lot of different media, and 
we experiment with working together. 
We explore, she said.

According to paleontologists, the 
earth is currently undergoing a mass 
extinction process similar to the one 
seen 65 million years ago when
last Thursday as part of Earth Day cel
ebrations sponsored by Earth, the cam
pus environmental group, Holst 
emphasized the importance of rainfor
est conservation in the fight to 
save many of the earths most endan
gered species.
NiN svyNh 9iNime mNgeg ieimm
Earth members water a newly planted tree on the mall.
dinosaurs became extinct. In the histo
ry of the world, paleontologists have 
identified five major extinction peri
ods. The last one was the extinction of 
the dinosaurs when a large number of 
species were wiped off the face of the 
earth. The number of species declin
ing again has not happened since pre
vious extinction periods, said Eric 
Holst, a representative of the 
Rainforest Alliance. In a presentation
Holst is the principal North 
American representative of the 
alliances ECO-O.K. Agricultural 
Certification Program. The goal of 
ECO-O.K. is to support agricultural 
products that are grown and produced 
on farms that meet certain agricultur
al standards. Holsts primary focus in 
the lecture was on the conservation of 
rainforests in an economically viable 
way. Holst said that companies would
only work to conserve the rainforest if 
there was an economic incentive.
One thing that keeps me coming 
back [to this issue] is the fear of what 
our world will be like without these 
species, said Holst. According to 
Holst, the rainforests may have 85 per
cent of the worlds species, and 2,000 
tropical forest plants offer potential 
cures for cancer. Birth control pills 
are derived from a plant which came 
from [a Mexican rainforest], said 
Holst. Holst also pointed out that 
Malaria treatments and bubble gum 
also came from rainforests.
Holst underscored a number of prob
lems related to deforestation in tropi
cal regions. Using slides as visual aids, 
he used the example of recent floods in 
Latin America to demonstrate that 
deforestation causes rainwater not to 
be trapped and absorbed by forests on 
mountains, thus causing flooding in 
the foothills of the mountains.
He first became interested in forest 
conservation as a child growing up in 
California through exposure to PBS 
documentaries and photography. In 
the films, according to Holst, the pro
ducers would always start off with 
images of lush forests and then end 
with images of destroyed rainforests. 
Choosing to start his presentation with 
the darker images Holst concluded his 
presentation by showing the audience 
the abundant plant and animal life 
present in the rainforests. Fifty per
cent of the rainforest still remains, 
he said.
Again using slides, Holst highlighted 
some of the most intriguing animal 
and plant life such as leaf-cutting ants, 
a variety of snakes, and monkeys. 
Political instability causes problems 
for wildlife, said Holst, pointing out 
the Rwandan gorillas who reside in a 
politically troubled state. Also, frog 
species are decreasing more rapidly 
than other species, and this is worry
ing because frogs usually preceded 
other extinction.
Holst then turned to solutions to con
clude his presentation. The ECO-O.K. 
committee that he heads is responsible 
for such products as SmartWood, 
which is wood that is produced in envi
ronmentally friendly rainforests. 
These products work to preserve their 
surroundings while remaining econom
ically viable.
Holst said that 60 forestry opera
tions in 3.8 million acres worldwide 
produce SmartWood currently. Holst 
also discussed ECO-O.K.s efforts to 
aid in more environmentally friendly 
production of such food products as 
cocoa, bananas, and sugar cane. 
Economies in a place like Ecuador will 
lose a major export if people boycott 
bananas, said Holst. We need to create ways [of conservation] that are 
viable economically. Holst closed the 
talk by saying that his organization 
was still a long way off from completed 
penetration of the marketplace with 
environmentally friendly food prod
ucts, but that they are starting to see 
some progress.
We wanted to do something in honor' 
of Earth Day to make students more, 
aware [of the day], said Elin A. Warn, a', 
fifth-year environmental science major' 
and president of CMUs Earth. We 
thought this lecture would be a good! 
thing on campus, and we hope to make 
it an annual event. Warn said she was' 
slightly disappointed with the turnout, 
and she hopes that more people will 
attend next year.
Eric Holst discussed the importance of farming that is environmentally sound.

How many ways could a typi
cal college student spend 
$10,000? Donations would most 
likely go towards tuition, rent, 
books, and food. But, how about 
as an investment to market a 
computer game that you made 
before your first year of college?
A few Carnegie Mellon stu
dents are doing just that. Firstyear computer science majors 
Ari Heitner, David Scherer, and 
Mark Feghai, along with two 
other college first-years and a 
couple of high school seniors, 
have formed a company called 
Singularity Software to market 
a game that has won the big 
bucks. At this years 
Independent Games Festival at 
the Game Developers 
Conference held in San Jose, 
California, this company of 
seven presented their grandprize winning 3-D real-time 
strategy game called Fire 
and Darkness.
The Independent Games 
Festival is described as being as 
big in computer gaming as the 
Sundance Film Festival is in 
movie industry. So winning it as 
unfunded college freshmen, 
especially as the youngest group 
of developers presenting, is 
nothing short of extraordinary. 
This relatively young industry 
is made up of 20-something prowho left big compato do this on their own, 
Scherer, president of 
Software. We just 
started four years before 
else.
Fire and Darkness was one of 
submissions, competing 
nst developers whose games 
as much as $15 million 
them.
Our book value going into 
this whole thing was basically 
$1000, said Heitner. Now I 
guess its a little more 
than that.
Their story began two sum
mers ago in Alexandria, 
Virginia, the hometown of all 
the group members, who attend
ed or are attending Thomas 
Jefferson High School for 
Science and Technology.
Whats nice about our situa
tion was we found the right mix 
of people who like our idea and 
did what we wanted to do, said 
Scherer. We didnt make the 
game for festivals; we made it to 
see if we could do it in the first 
place, said Heitner.
Fire and Darkness was 
inspired by the technology of 
Command and Conquer and the 
graphics of Quake. The group 
collaborated on ideas through
out the summer, though their 
efforts were not complete. Their 
visit to the Electronic 
Entertainment Expo gave them 
the impetus to continue working 
on the game throughout the 
next summer, and into the fol
lowing year.
We would rather have a 
half-finished, good game that 
we could go somewhere with, 
rather than a complete, but 
poorly designed game that we 
couldnt go anywhere with, 
said Scherer.
Fire and Darkness features 
what Scherer calls the top-ofthe-line landscape engine, 
which creates a surreal 3-D ter
rain, as well as tanks, aircraft, 
and weaponry, whose battle
field simulation force the player 
to form the best strategy.
We made sure it had a good 
design and multiplayer format 
from the beginning and that it 
could be played over basically
any Internet connection with
out giving one player an advan
tage, said Heitner.
Basically you wont have a 
disadvantage if you are playing 
against somebody with a faster 
modem, said Scherer.
We didnt even know what 
the judges were looking for, we 
just hoped to get some atten
tion, said Scherer. We didnt 
go into it thinking we were 
going to win; we just wanted 
to show off our game to 
the publishers.
Heitner and Scherer report 
that there still is more work to 
be done on the game, such as 
adding a storyline and more 
scenarios. The group collabo
rates efforts between CMU, 
MIT, the University of 
California at Berkeley, and 
Thomas Jefferson High School 
during the school year, and 
then works all summer on addi
tions and upgrades to the game. 
We just keep going with this by 
pure momentum, said Heitner.
Right now we are waiting for 
a retail deal from a big-time 
developer, said Scherer. If 
that happens, there is a possi
bility that I would consider tak
ing off school to work full-time 
on it. Heitner said he 
would have to wait to make 
that decision.
This experience has taught 
me that college isnt every
thing, said Scherer. It just 
made me realize that if Im pre
sented with opportunity to 
learn, Im going to keep my 
options open. Sometimes you 
might just have to take a step 
away to make a bigger step for
ward. But I think we all are 
waiting to hear what the pub
lishers have to say before we 
think of whats next on 
our agenda.
Aseem still doesnt have an assistant!
(Please help.) Write, learn, grow.
The Tartan can be the experience of a lifetime.

tgpevSevt 1eSOeN FNeUvmteSLess Stress?
by Emily Landes
I am a cultural analysis junkie. Not culture in 
the traditional sense, Im talking about culture in 
the Melrose Place, Britney Spears, Cosmo Sex 
Quiz sense of the word. You know, the kind of 
mass culture that a whole society has access to. 
What people choose to do with their spare time 
and money is just fascinating to me. So, even 
though I knew that it was going to yield some 
scary results, I just had to try and analyze the 
very bizarre culture of CMU. When asking myself 
where I should go for these cultural field tests, I 
came up with only one answer. To the clusters!
While there are a number of different clusters 
on campus  ask your nearest tour guide for an 
exact number  I decided to go to three. First, by 
virtue of it being the hangout of my homies in the 
humanities, I went to the Baker Hall cluster on 
the first floor. I also went to the cluster upstairs 
in CFA, where everyone seems to agree that the 
best computers are located. And then, I went to 
(shiver) the fifth floor of Wean.
First let me tell you what I, with my stereotypin mind, was expecting. In Baker I would find 
lots of people working hard, but not about to 
reach nervous-breakdown-size stress loads. The 
CFA cluster was going to be almost completely 
empty  my rationale for this being, what do 
drama majors need with computers? In Wean, I 
imagined complete silence barring the clicking of 
frantically fast typing, some sort of indefinable 
stench, and a male-female ratio of about 56:1.
For the most part, my preconceptions about the 
Baker cluster were correct. There was a sense of 
community to the cluster; people often got up 
from their chairs and spoke to other people. A lot 
of computers seemed to be used for group pro
jects. People were working hard, but there was 
still a sense of levity to the work. I even heard 
someone laugh. Twice. I congratulated myself for 
knowing my people so well. Then I went to go get 
a printout.
The printer room was another matter entirely. 
With only two printers, and room for nearly 100 
students in the cluster, most of whom needed to 
print something, that community spirit went 
right out the window. A new emotion took its 
place. It was pissed. No, pissed and anxious.
These feelings were emphasized by the fact that, 
at any given time, only one of these two printers 
was working. Sometimes neither of them was 
capable of printing. A whiteboard bearing the title 
Printers that are down assured me that this 
behavior was fairly commonto this cluster. With 
these conditions, a person (like this writer), could 
wait up to 20 minutes just to get their paper; 
People who printed out more than five or so pages i 
got the glare of death from others, like this writer; ! 
in the room.
In comparison, I had no problem printing out in 
the CFA cluster. I pressed Print, and moments * 
later I was holding the paper in my hand. This is ' 
not to say that the CFA cluster was the veritable 
ghost town that I had expected.
Most of the computers were occupied, especial* 
ly the Octanes, the pride of the cluster.When I > 
looked to see what most of the people were doing,
I saw that many of them seemed to be composing> 
on keyboards or designing.
Thats when I realized that my knowledge of! 
how one creates art was entirely outdated. I had 
thought that people were still drawing and com
posing on, you know, paper. How silly of me t$- 
leave the arts out of our generations reliance or[ 
technology. It would be like someone assumingthat I still write all of my research papers out' 
in longhand.
But some people dont have to worry about 
research papers, or any sort of paper for that mat
ter. And that brings us to Wean. I was honestly * 
nervous to walk in there. I dont know what I 
thought went on in there, but a sign on the front 
door let me know pretty clearly what didnt go on. 
No Food. No Drink. No Exceptions, the official 
sign said. No Sex. No Sleep. No Life. No Shit! 
some fed-up CS person had added. I should men
tion that there is more than one cluster on thgfifth floor of Wean. However, I was quickly told by;- 
my Wean tour guide that 5419, the cluster thafhas PCs and Windows NT, was a slum and that  
the hardcore cluster was 5201.1 braced myself, 
and went in. There was no stench. There was no  
silence. And, most shockingly, there were girls!  
Clearly, I was floored. I sat in 5201 for about half 
an hour, in complete disbelief that people were 
talking to each other. Where was the stressed-out 
Protestant work ethic that people told me about?
So heres what I learned from my experience:, 
Dont believe anything that anyone tells you. The 
computer people dont have it so bad, the human
ities people dont have it so good, and the arts peopie arent quite so technology-phobic as you might 
think. Yes, the truth is out there. Unfortunately,  
you have to go to the clusters to find it.
Emily Landes would like to organize a clusterexchange day. Please contact her if you would like 
to be involved.

HISTORY, from page LI the most prominent structures on the I
that GSIA has gained in reputation CMU campus. The original GSIA
HSTORY, from page LI
tliat GSIA has gained in reputation 
over the past 50 years, according to 
Cooper and Norton, is because the 
school has chosen to focus on man
agement sciences and other opera
tional sciences. In 1999 U.S. News 
and World Report ranked the school 
second in Management Information 
Sciences and also second in 
Production/ Operations Management.
GSLAhas accomplished many of the 
goals it set forth 10 years ago at its 40th 
anniversary. When I assumed respon
sibilities as dean in 1983, GSIA imple
mented a strategic plan to solidify its 
leadership and to position the school for 
continued sucess, said former dean 
Elizabeth Bailey 10 years ago. To 
ensure our continuing stature as a top 
management school, we recruited a crit
ical mass of outstanding faculty in all 
functional business reas. to strengthen 
our business ties, we increased contacts 
with CEOs, expanded the program for 
Executives, and introduced the flextime program.
; Over the last fifty years, GSIA has 
also physically expanded into one of
the most prominent structures on the 
CMU campus. The original GSIA 
building was completed in October of 
1952, and it is this building that saw 
over four decades of GSIA innovation, 
including CMUs first computer, an 
IBM 560.
In 1993 GSIA saw the dedication of 
Posner Hall which would allow the 
school to move into the next millenni
um with a state-of-the-art research 
and learning center complete with 
rooms equipped with wireless net
works. Finally, last Friday saw the 
roof breaking of yet another expan
sion  a technologically advanced 
third floor for Posner Hall.
The weekend allowed for alumni, 
faculty, staff, and friends to take a 
look at GSIAs rich past and to catch a 
glimpse of the future. The sessions 
were very well-planned, said David 
Coulter, a 1971 Industrial 
Administration graduate and former 
CEO of Bank of America. I think it 
would be interesting to take [the con
cepts addressed today] and ask how 
do we adapt them for the future 
[of GSIA].

for GSIA. Tridas
Mukhopadhyay, director of the 
program, said that e-commerce 
is revolutionizing business 
everywhere. Business will not 
stay the same; the dinosaurs 
will give way to the mammals, 
he said.
Conducting the meeting was 
Bob Evans, editor-in-chief of 
Information Week, who started 
with information of changes fac
ing todays business structures. 
Following him was 
Mukhopadhyay, who explained 
what e-commerce was, and then 
Michael Shamos, co-director of 
the program, who explained the 
dangers facing the program, 
which he named the Agents of
E-Doom. Solutions to. E-Doom 
are to police thyself, act ethical
ly, and shun those who dont, he 
posted as his solutions to any 
potential threats to e-commerce. 
Finally, bringing on the future 
of e-commerce was Raj Reddy, 
dean of the School of Computer 
Science, who explained that ecommerce would increase pro
ductivity, as it would drop the 
need for the middleman.

WEEKEND, from page LI
half of the event was entitled 
The First 50 Years in 
Management Education and 
was given by some founding fac
ulty of the school: Herbert 
Simon and William Cooper.
This 50th anniversary of the 
founding of GSIA provides an 
opportunity for reflection on 
what was accomplished,
said Cooper.
The second half, The Next 50 
Years - Preparing Tomorrows 
Business Leaders, featured 
some of todays major innova
tors. One of them was Paul 
Allaire, a member of the Class of 
66 and Chief Executive Officer 
of Xerox.
On Saturday, as part of a lun
cheon in the Mellon Auditorium, 
Dunn and Fallaw Sowell, 
deputy dean of student and 
alumni affairs, presented State 
of the Enterprise: GSIA Today. 
It started with a State of the 
School slideshow from Dunn 
with statistics and information 
about the current status of the 
school as well as its future direc
tions. Dunn said the adminis
tration is very concerned about 
the school maintaining its repu
tation as one of the best in the 
nation due to increasing exter
nal competition and pressures.
It isnt true that everyone 
wants to be in the top 20 [busi
ness schools], said Dunn. Id 
say that only 400 schools do.
Sowell followed with a similar 
presentation of the State of the 
MBA program. In addition to 
some facts and figures, he 
explained how the curriculum 
has changed since the alumni 
worked through it.
[The Management Game] has 
been changed a bit. They no 
longer make soap, they now 
make wristwatch.es, said Sowell, 
with laughter from the audience. 
Its also Web-based now, instead 
of being played over Andrew.
Saturday concluded with some 
more information sessions and 
senior thesis presentations. In 
the evening several reunion din
ners took place as well as a din
ner hosted by some GSIA faculty 
members. Finally, trolley car 
rides to several local bars 
topped off the weekend.
Overall, the organizers 
seemed to be satisfied with the 
celebration festivities and 
looked at it as a different kind of 
reunion.GSIA is in a lot of com
petition with other schools. A lot 
of people are getting into busi
ness education and coming after
our faculty and students, said 
Sowell. But it feels reinvigorating to have alumni come 
back with their support.... 
Its more of a celebration, and 
its wonderful.
Nevertheless, alumni are just 
glad to be back and take in all of 
the changes and nostalgia of 
their alma mater.
Its interesting that people 
still get drawn to this place, 
said Jay Chitnis, a member of 
the class of 1994. They take 
time out from their schedules - 
and they are very busy  to come 
here for the GSIA food.

rick a noun. Now. Dont keep reading, pick a noun. Okay, 
remember it. Lets go: Once upon a time, there was a little red 
refrigerator named Steve. Now, what was special about Steve is 
that he was owned by a mafia kingpin. Usually LRRs like Steve 
were used to store butter and eggs, but since Steve was special he 
would store sides of beef and the occasional informant. In fact, 
Steves owner called Steve the Icebox, which made Steve feel like 
a real mafia member, even though refrigerators arent people. 
Okay, remember that noun I had you pick? Say it three times to 
the next person you see. Wasnt that fun? Have a good summer!

The Harder They Are The Farder They Chew
Drunken Bash Of Farders Answers All
by: James Kenney
UMiTt> MIMIS-TR*-Jri fgARue^i 0U/WT
Dq$WfgNtInsiideWor S0aC*putdsW| GlS wSc~^I invited the boy with a fanny pack on his head, 
Icarus Maximus Paled, Calvin ReKleiner, Wound 
Man, Anti-Pregnancy Woman, Barrel 'O Laughs, 
and Curious George. Let me tell you, the party 
wasn't exactly swinging. The guys were all over 
Anti-Pregnancy Woman, cuz she's a woman. After 
downing 2 bottles of vodka, George became 
enraged and tried to smash a bottle of Vladimir 
over my head. Silly monkey, it's plastic. Boing.
I called my mother yesterday, she pretended I 
had the wrong number. I called her bluff, she 
told me my comic sucked. I cried. She told me 
that they were all irrelevant. I cried. She told me 
I was a worthless hunchback and hung up. That's 
when it hit me, I had to put the harder back in 
farder. I bought 3 dozen bottles of Vladimirvodka, 
made my bed, took down my poster of Bo Jackson 
and made some phone calls to some close friends.

I turned to Calvin ReKleiner with a saddened look. 
He proclaimed fear not, I know anorexic models! 
About an hour later 14 groovy babes showed up, 
reeking of perfume. One thing led to another, 
and the next morning we awoke nude, amongst 
the vomit and empty bottles, intertwined into 
a mass of "farder". So you see everything relates
in the end... If you want some Farder this summer, I can 
mail you any comics I do. Email jpkenney to get on the list.
Amidst the action, the sound of my doorbell 
was heard. Wound Man, who had drunken 
himself into a stupor to ease the pain, answered 
the door. Wonder Boy entered, screaming at me 
for "not inviting him". He went to the bathroom 
to do some lines, Fanny Head followed. I noticed 
that Anti-Pregnancy Woman and I.M. Paled had 
disappeared into my bedroom. George had 
passed out in a puddle of his own vomit.

DIVERSIONS
By ANDY FRANCIS
: ' Tartan Staffwriter
The new Austin 
Powers movie. Will 
Smiths Wild Wild 
^ | West. Sure, all of the 
maj or Hollywood stu
dios are planning to 
3 - roll out some big event
| movies for the sum
mer, but when it comes 
to hype, anticipation, 
and sheer size, nothing 
will top the May 19 re
lease of Star Wars Episode 
I: The Phantom Menace. The 
first of a planned trio of prequels 
to the phenomenally successful
Star Wars franchise, George 
Lucass newest offering has built 
up more anticipation than the av
erage Presidential election and 
has inspired some die-hard fans 
to line up for tickets over a month 
ahead of time. For a film taking 
place a long, long time ago in a 
galaxy far, far away, The Phan
tom Menace has generated some 
impressive buzz.
Until scenes were previewed last 
November and the trailer hit the
aters in March, fans had little other 
than Star Wars mastermind 
Lucass remarkable track record 
to gain their interest. The script 
and set were kept top secret, with 
only Lucas and a handful of princi
pal actors given any knowledge 
about what the film was actually 
about. Eventually, despite the ef
forts of everyone involved, secrets 
about the movie began to leak out; 
bits of dialogue and detailed plot 
lines have been posted on the 
Internet by people apparently in
tent on spoiling the surprise for 
others. Still, even during the topsecret phase of the production, 
fans were made aware that the 
prequels chronicle young Anakin 
Skywalkers rise from farmhand 
to Jedi with the help of Obi-Wan 
Kenobi, and his subsequent turn 
to the dark side of the Force as 
villainous Darth Vader.
Although it has been 16 years
since Return of the Jedi hit the big 
screen, Phantom Menace only took 
about four years to piece together 
Technically, the majority of the film
ing took place in England, but 8

LIOThe Tartan  Carnegie Mellon University  26 April 1999Concert highlights modern-day composers
By DEREK DREYER
Tartan Staffwriter
Admittedly, they never play 
Beethoven, a fundamental strike 
against any classical music group, 
especially in Pittsburgh. But the 
: CMU Contemporary Ensemble 
1 does provide the most consistently 
' interesting and refreshing con: certs around, and last Thursday 
| night was no exception. Its a 
! shame that more CMU students 
dont take advantage of this topnotch student ensemble because 
.it gives us a free and casual look 
into the exciting classical music 
world of today. All right. Enough 
with the much-needed advertise
ment, on with the show.
Thursdays program began with 
a piece by contemporary Spanish 
composer Agustin Charles en\ titled About a Dark Summer and 
scored for small chamber en; semble. Despite what the pro;gram notes indicated, the only 
words I could think to describe it 
would be textural and atmo
spheric. Its the kind of piece in 
which the pianist spent the ma
jority of her time under the hood, 
so to speak, strumming the in
nards of the piano. Altogether, 
the effect the music produced was
that of an amorphous threat of 
nature, but with its seeming lack 
of structure, I could never really 
get into it.
No matter: The second piece on 
the program, by CMU junior Gre
gory Smith, was a delightful suite 
of five miniatures, inspired by 
the life of Gregor Mendel, the 
famed discoverer of the laws of 
heredity. Before itbegan, the com
poser suggested we imagine how 
Mendel might feel were he to see 
the applications of genetics to
day, both positive and negative. 
This is all well and good, but the 
sign of a solid instrumental com
position is whether it can stand 
on its own without the help of 
extramusical themes. And 
Smiths piece most certainly did. 
If perhaps the brevity and frag
mentation of the work prevented 
it from attaining the cumulative 
power it seemed to strive for, 
Smiths rich and eclectic approach 
to harmony made the listening 
experience a joy.
The third selection of the 
evening (and the only one which 
was not a world premiere) was 
Igor Stravinskys Octet for Wind 
Instruments of 1923 (revised 
1952). One of the fathers of mod
ern classical music, Stravinsky is
particularly notable for trying his 
hand at several disparate styles 
throughout his career, with re
sounding suc
cess in all of 
them. The 
Octet is typi
cal of his early 
neoclassical 
period, in 
which musi
cal styles of 
the eigh
teenth cen
tury are wit
tily combined 
with a mod
ern sensibil
ity. This work 
in particular 
exhibits the 
jagged edges 
one might ex
pect from 
such a clash 
of styles, 
veering from 
the feel of a 
funeral 
march to that of a minstrel show 
with the greatest of ease. This is 
not one of Stravinskys easiest 
works to listen to or perform, but 
his crisp rhythms and pungent 
harmonies were enhanced by the
players cool precision and confi
dence.

this concert.Orchestra wins over writer after doub e feature
By SRINVAS PULLELA
Tartan Staffwriter
Over the weekend, the Pittsburgh 
Symphony Orchestra (PSO) showcased 
their diverse talent in two different con
certs at Heinz Hall. On Friday evening, 
the PSO was led by guest conductor 
Sergiu Comissiona, the music director 
of the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra. 
Under the direction of Comissiona, the 
PSO played three works.
The first work on the program was 
Schuberts Symphony Number Three. 
The work was played with clarity by the 
PSO, and Comissiona did a fair job of 
conducting one of Schuberts most beau
tiful symphonies. Without a doubt, the 
first movement was the best executed, 
with clear musical contrasts on the part 
of the orchestra and solid direction by 
Comissiona. After that, the playing 
lacked unity in certain areas, and the 
PSO managed to complete the familiar 
piece in a mediocre manner.
The second piece on the program was 
by far the highlight of the evening for the 
orchestra and for the audience. Andrs 
Crdenes, concert master and CMU fac
ulty member, did a brilliant job of ex
ecuting a fiendishly difficult piece of 
music. The slow first movement of 
Wieniawskis second violin and the faster 
second movement of the concerto gave 
Crdenes an opportunity to move the 
audience with his ability to play crisply 
and with great passion movements that 
are otherwise somewhat dull.
In the third movement Crdenes 
thrilled the audience with his virtuosity 
while the movement presented him with 
a set of new challenges in the form of a
series of intensely difficult passages. 
Cardenes was clearly having to work 
hard to keep up the incredible pace that 
he set for himself. He was immensely 
successful, and the audience commended 
him with a standing ovation while 
C&rdenes returned to the stage for three 
curtain calls.
After the intermission, the orchestra 
and Comissiona returned to perform sev
eral excerpts from Prokofievs Romeo 
and Juliet in what can only be de
scribed as a passable substitution for 
what was to have been performed. 
The program was supposed to have 
included works by Zemlinsky and 
Janacek under the direction of James 
Conlon, one of the countrys pre
eminent conductors, butZemlinskys 
Cymbeline Suite and J&naceks 
Sinfonietta were cancelled at the 
last minute due to the fact that 
Conlon was sick with influenza. The 
replacement conductor did an admi
rable job of conducting, though the 
evening was not as brilliant as it 
could have been.
The PSO returned Saturday night 
for Laffs, Riffs, and Escapades, a 
heavily attended Soundbytes concert 
at Heinz Hall last Saturday. This 
concert marked the last concert of 
the Soundbytes series, which was 
designed to attract a younger audi
ence to the world of classical music.
Led by host Charles Kimbrough and 
guest conductor Christopher Wilkins, 
the PSO presented an entertaining 
program showcasing humorous mo
ments and comic sketches in classical 
orchestral repertoire.
The program opened with four brief
but sprightly selections, or Laffs, in
cluding Strausss lively Furiosa Polka, 
Mozarts brisk Overture to Le nozze di 
Figaro, and two movements from Iberts 
triumphant Divertissement. Under the 
direction of Wilkins, who displayed an 
unusually animated style of conducting 
that occasionally bordered on dancing, 
the orchestra played these excerpts with 
colorful intensity and passion. His swift,
broad arm gestures and vigorous leaps, 
however, did not afford him sufficient 
control over sections of the orchestra, as
he was unable to keep the string ai 
winds playing consistently togeth 
whenever the tempo increased.
Throughout the concert, film clips fro 1 
such movies as Amadeus and MahU 
were screened alongside witty, inform 
tive commentary from Kimbrough td 
give historical background and signifi
cance to the performed repertoire. Two 
other characters, in the roles of a tacky, 
eccentric musicologist and an oldschool formalist music critic, oc
casionally added to the commen
tary with short skits where they 
interjected insights of their own.
This drama was perhaps in
tended to enhance the humor
ous tone of the program, but it 
unfortunately failed to do so, as 
the trite jokes these characters 
cracked were hardly worth 
laughing at, and succeeded for 
the most part only in eliciting 
headshakes of embarrassment 
from the audience.
Following the Laffs came the 
Riffs, or, as Kimbrough ex
plained, pieces in which a theme 
is presented and developed 
through variations. Under 
Wilkinss direction, the orchestra 
displayed its versatility in this 
portion of the program, as it 
brought just as much spirit and 
life to the darkly humorous third 
movement from Mahlers Sym
phony No. 1 and as to the driving, 
speedy rhythms of Hoedown in 
Copelands Rodeo. Also featured 
as Riffs were Strausss capricious Donner 
und Blitz Polka and Kabalevskys 
Galop from The Comedians.
After a brief intermission, the or
chestra concluded the concert with a 
series of escapades, or selections that 
portrayed some sort of a musical jour
ney or adventure. The featured reper
toire included yet two more polkas, by 
Shostakovich and Stravinsky, and 
Strausss well-known tone poem Till 
Eulenspiegels Merry Pranks. As the 
orchestra performed the latter selec
tion, which was based on the tales of a 
roguish prankster, narrative phrases 
were screened above the stage to pro.- 
vide an interpretative storyline to 
the piece.
The concert closed on an optimistic 
note with An Orkney Wedding with Sun
rise, composed by Peter Davies to depict 
a Scottish traditional wedding. Toward 
the end of this escapade, in what was 
intended as a musical representation of 
jthe sun dawning over Scotland, a bagliper entered from the back of Heinz 
all and marched his way to the front, 
ventually joining the orchestra on stage 
,br a triumphant finale. Throughout this 
nal segment, a seemingly tireless 
ilkins conducted with extraordinary 
al, and the orchestra played with comlensurate passion.
[Although the on-stage drama and 
ided commentary became excessive at 
titles, overall, the program proved to be a 
:cess with the audience. With the two 
concerts this weekend, the PSO, as agroup, 
shewed off its wide range of remarkable 
talfeits and performed exceptionally well, 
thoigh at times the audience was left 
hungering for more than was delivered. 
Nex\ weekend the PSO will present 
Psams and Songs under the direction of 
vals Director Mariss Jansons.

l 9epvNtvMc NgNRumgweS ivNpscreen again this summer in Blue 
Streak. This time around, the foulmouthed funny guy stars as Miles 
Logan, a talented jewel thief who 
becomes involved in a $20-million diamond heist that goes bad, 
forcing him to hide the jewels at 
a construction site. In his at
tempts to retrieve the gems, Miles 
finds himself impersonating a 
detective and winningthe respect 
of his fellow cops. The film will 
likely include numerous one-lin
ers and car chases to make up for 
what seems to be a rather routine 
plot, and appears to be worth
while only to die-hard Martin 
Lawrence fans.
Disney might have finally run 
out of stories to turn into ani
mated films, as this summers 
family film genre is void of 
Donald, Mickey, and their co
horts. Instead, its a Muppet 
frenzy, as little kids nationwide 
will be begging their parents to 
take them to see Adventures of 
Elmo in Grouchland and 
Muppets from Space. In Adven
tures of Elmo, the audience is 
asked to follow the cute, cuddly 
Muppet on a search for his favor
ite blue blanket that has been
whisked away to the smelly, 
grumpy, garbage-can-laden 
Grouchland. While not a jour
ney of self-discovery worth an 
Oscar nod, the children will 
certainly enjoy it, but the blue 
blanket may have many par
ents wishing they were asleep.
Muppets from Space takes the 
Muppet gang on a trip into the 
world of extraterrestrials as they 
search for Gonzos family history, 
after he announces on Miss Piggys 
U.F.O Mania talk show that he is 
living proof that We are not alone. 
Again, this is probably not as rivet
ing for the over-eight demographic 
as it is for the elementaiy-school 
crowd, but it should do fairly nicely 
in the box office.
While this summers movies 
may lack the impact of earlier 
films such as Life is Beautiful, 
for those who are willing to pay 
$7 just for the novelty of sitting 
in an air-conditioned movie the
ater during heat-stroke weather, 
the summer of 99 shouldnt be 
too much of a disappointment. 
But for those of you tired of the 
usual Hollywood monotony, you 
might want to invest in a good 
book and some sunscreen.
Movie promises to awe audience with effects
STAR WARS, from page, L9
the original movies great. A 
number of familiar faces will 
appear in Phantom Menace. 
Trainspotting's Ewan 
McGregor takes the lead role 
as the young Kenobi; Liam 
Neeson portrays Kenobis ally 
Jedi master Qui-Gon Jinn and 
nine-year-old Jake Lloyd is 
Anakin Skywalker. Even 
though she is eight years 
Lloyds senior, Natalie 
Portman plays the eventual 
mother of Luke and Leia, 
Samuel L. Jackson shows up 
as a Jedi Council member, and 
newcomer Ray Park assumes 
the face of evil as Darth Maul.
Star Wars fans should also 
be pleased with the reappear
ance of classic characters like 
C-3P0, R2-D2, and Yoda.
Nevertheless, the players 
will take a backseat in this 
grand spectacle of a movie that 
most industry experts expect to 
haul in over $1 billion world
wide. It will more than likely be 
one of the most visually stunling pictures of all time. Judging 
fom tie time and money Lucas 
has invested in special effects (he 
plans t) digitally enhance every 
siqglfe jihot in the next two installmi'nts), Phantom Menace 
should redefine film-making 
much a? the original Star Wars 
did 22 jjears ago.
The jj(pe surrounding Star 
Wars Ipisode I: The Phantom 
Menace has put pressure on 
GeorgeULucas and his crew at 
Lucasflm. It certainly wont be 
easy fyi'Lucas to follow up argu
ably tie most popular movies 
ever created* and there will cer
tainlybe some fans who will 
claim lisappointment in even 
the mcU superior qualities of 
Phanton Menace.
Yet, jjucass work on Ameri
can Giaffiti and the Indiana 
Jones series prove that Star 
Warsssuccess was no fluke. It 
is a g'o)d bet that Lucas has a 
few npre great movies up his 
sleeve, and many people will 
plan trtake a day off on May 19 
to seepne of them.

Student Film Festival
Do you want to go support students in the arts? 
You know you do. You didnt think that your friends 
could act, did you? But they do, and they make 
movies too. As always, the film festival is always a 
surprise. So, go and check out what this years show 
has to offer.
At 7:30, 10 pm, and 12:30 am
In McConomy Auditorium
Friday, April 30
Fiesta de Primavera
Celebrate the last day of classes the way they 
should be celebrated, with some good ol fashioned 
film fun. AB will be showing their Friday night 
movies outdoors on the Cut. The first movie will be 
the recent foreign film Waking Ned Devine.
Devine is the story of a small Irish village where 
two devious elderly men (Ian Bannen and David 
Kelley) plot to find out which one of their neighbors 
has just won the lottery. When they discover that its 
old Ned Devine, who died from shock when he found 
out he had won, the two men begin a tale of mistaken 
identities that turns the tiny village upside down.
The second movie will be the highly lauded 
and much-adored Blues Brothers. As if we all dont 
know the premise of this one, one sentence for you: 
Were on a mission from God. Filled with outstand
ing music, funny one-liners, and a climax scene that 
leaves nothing to be desired, Blues Brothers is an 
American fascination and thats all there is to it.
- Starring Jim Belushi, Dan Ackroyd, James Brown, 
John Candy, Aretha Franklin, and Ray Charles, 
Blues Brothers is definitely an icon of our times.

Saving Private Ryan
Finally, its here  The long-awaited arrival of 
Saving Private Ryan in McConomy Auditorium. Of 
course, it is one of the most moving films of all time, 
provocative and upsetting in its every action. A great 
film to show the weekend before we enter that other 
traumatic period known as final exams.
Starring Tom Hanks and Matt Damon, Private 
Ryan is the story of a world tom apart by war. It is 
discovered that in a family where three brothers have 
been killed in World War II, there exists a fourth 
brother, who is believed to still be living. The mission 
is to find the fourth brother and bring him home to his 
mother alive.
Steven Spielberg analyzes the issue of heroism on 
the battlefield, and how far people will go for the love 
of their country. Winner of a laundry list of Oscars 
and Golden Globes, Saving Private Ryan promises to 
inspire us all to live through the battlefield of life.
At 6, 9 pm, and midnight
In McConomy Auditorium
Sunday, May 2
Tron
Well, if it wasnt Saving Private Ryan that you were 
waiting for this semester, then it is most definitely 
Tron. Youheartless computer scientists! Have youno 
compassion? This 1982 film defines old-school com
puter dorkiness, a subject that seems to instill pride 
and sentimentalism in the hearts of CMU students all 
over. One of the first movies to utilize extensive 
computer graphics, Tron has a weak plot, weak char
acters, and no point  but, hey, it looks nifty and 
thats all that matters, right?
At 8, 10 pm, and midnight 
In McConomy Auditorium

Nightmares on Wax
Carboot Soul 
Matador/Warp
Nightmares on Wax, the 
quintessential chill-out group, 
is back with another funky, fla
vorful CD of hip-hop after a fouryear absence. Carboot Soul is 
everything youd want from a 
group fixed within its genre: 
instantly recognizable as a prod
uct of its predecessors but dis
tinctive enough that it stands 
alone  more succinctly, a 
complement as well as an addi
tion to the canon.
A live band is the biggest dif
ference between Carboot and 
NOWs previous two albums, 
Smokers Delight and A Word of 
Science. Though collaborator 
and co-songwriter Robin Taylor-Firth (who appears on this 
album in a similar capacity) did 
provide keyboards on previous 
albums, a live bass and guitar 
were never used.
On this album, however, 
NOWs founder, George 
E*A*S*E Evelyn, scales back 
his use of samples, which makes 
for the most organic Nightmares
on Wax album yet.
The album begins like all 
NOW albums, with a version of 
Nights. This iteration uses live 
strings and is titled Les Nuits. 
At first the live orchestration 
sounds odd, but once the bass 
kicks in, you know youre in for 
a comfortable hour of listening.
Evelyn brought in a vocalist, 
Sara Winton, for the first time, 
adding some spice to the old track. 
Labelmate Jimi Tenor co-wrote 
Easejimi, adding his distinctive 
swanky sound to NOWs.
Carboot Soul doesnt break any 
new ground, but its a fantastic
makeover of one of the best chill
out collectives in Europe.

Tartan Contributing Editor 
& ISH HARSHAWAT
Tartan News Editor
Burt Bacharach has been everywhere. Hes 
made 25 appearances on the popular music 
Top Ten charts. Hes filled many bachelor 
pads with lounge music to help woo the 
ladies during the age of free love. Hes played 
on a bus headed to Las Vegas in the film 
Austin Powers. And during Carnival week
end, he performed at Heinz Hall with the 
Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra (PSO).
This recent installment of the 1999 Pitts
burgh Pops Concerts opened with several 
interesting pieces, including a three-movement Concerto for Bass Trombone and Or
chestra. This was the premiere performance 
of the concerto by Chris Brubeck, the son of 
cool jazz innovator Dave Brubeck. A medley 
of Duke Ellington songs followed to cel
ebrate his 100th birthday. Following inter
mission, Bacharach took the spotlight with 
the PSO, his traveling band, a piano, and 
a keyboard.
Bacharach has written popular music for 
over four decades. In the 1960s, while singersongwriters took over the radio waves with
folk and rock n roll, Bacharach composed and 
produced songs for artists such as Dionne 
Warwick, Jackie DeShannon, and Tom Jones. 
The orchestration ranged from rock to soul to 
Broadway, as evidenced in American classics 
such as What the World Needs Now, Rain
drops Keep Falling on My Head, and I Say a 
Little Prayer.
Since appearing in A ustin Powers, Bacharach 
has continued his comeback with a significant 
degree of success. Several compilations of his 
music have been released, including a four-disc 
box set. In February, he won a Grammy for Best 
Pop Collaboration With Vocals as part of a 
collaboration with British singer-songwriter 
Elvis Costello which included the 1998 album 
Painted from Memory.
The performance opened with a quick, gran
diose rendition of What the World Needs Now 
with the PSO. From there, Bacharach shone 
with a medley of some of his greatest hits. 
Members of the crowd clapped at the beginning 
of each song, recognizing throughout the night 
the amount of music the man has contributed 
throughout his years. Bacharach was in full 
style, frequently up from his seat at the piano, 
hands moving wildly guiding the orchestra, 
then back down again tickling the piano keys 
while bobbing his head to his own music.
Songs that were part of the medley in
cluded Reach Out and crowd favorite 
Do You Know the Way to San Jose. Most 
of the hits were sung by Bacharachs sing
ers, but he occasionally lent his own voice 
to some songs such as A House is Not 
a Home.
From there, Bacharach and the Pops 
ran through some of his movie soundtrack 
contributions. One of the highlights of the 
show was his eternal classic Raindrops 
Keep Falling on my Head, which at one 
point he encouraged the entire audience to 
help join him in singing.
For the last performance, the loungelizard first thanked those who had made 
the show possible. He then said I think 
its an appropriate time for this and 
finished up with Thats What Friends 
are For.
No one could get enough of Bacharach, 
and for his encore he gave the crowd what 
they wanted. He exited the way he came 
outwith a slowed-down version of What 
the World Needs Now. Beautifully ren
dered, this piece seemed to leave a sweet 
taste after the end of the show, and send 
out a message to Pittsburgh: What the 
world needs now is more Burt Bacharach.

GROOVY, from page L9
each scene has its own defining 
qualities and there are no dull 
moments throughout the movie.
In the sequel, which is actually a 
prequel, Powerss mojo, or sexual 
ability, is taken away by his nem
esis Dr. Evil. Because Powers re
lies so much on his mojo for his job 
as an international man of mys
tery, Dr. Evil has effectively ren
dered Austin Powers powerless. 
Dr. Evil then uses time travel to 
return to the 60s with Mr. 
Bigglesworth, his cat, where he 
plans to reek havoc on the entire 
planet.
Dr. Evil (surprise, surprise) 
upon his return to the 60s plans 
to take over the world. Those 
who saw the original Austin 
Powers will be pleased to see 
some features of the first movie 
in the sequel. When Dr. Evil 
makes his demands to the 
United Nations, he demands bil
lions of dollars, which is obvi
ously ludicrous in the 60s. His 
demand is met with laughter 
and he is forced to ask for just 
millions of dollars.
While some of the jokes from 
the original movie, such as the 
ransom joke, have been reused 
in the second movie, the new 
movie still promises a wide 
range of new anecdotes. One of

The International Man of Mystery is back. Austin Powers 2: The Spy Who Shagged Me takes place in the 
60s when Austin Powers battles his nemesis Dr. Evil. Shown above, Mr. Powers sips a cocktail on his 
shagadelic jumbo jet in the original film, Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery.
them on one more time.
Powers, with the assistance of 
his sidekick Felicity Shagwell, 
played by Heather Graham, are 
forced to return to the 60s to chase 
after Dr. Evil and Mr. Bigglesworth 
the most promising aspects of so that he can regain his mojo. 
the new film is a two-foot midget With Powers back in his native
that imitates everything that 
Dr. Evil does (down to his now 
famous finger to the mouth 
expression). While Dr. Evil, the 
midget, and Mr. Bigglesworth 
present a formidable challenge 
to the world, it is still felt that 
Powers has the ability to take
60s, the film is able to use a whole 
range of jokes and anecdotes that 
werent possible in the original. 
According to some who have read 
the script and seen rough cuts of 
the movie, there is a scene in which 
everybody is naked in the spirit of 
the free-love 60s, even the extras.

Ili Dan, I said to my roommate. He was watching some cartoons. I had 
finished my last class and was free for the rest of day. It was only 
3:46 pm. I picked up the newspaper and started to read some of the 
news out loud to him. He said Dude, I am watching this. Can you 
read it to yourself? So I quieted down. He had a class at 4 pm, so 
he left shortly after. He left the TV on. So I put it on a news 
channel. It was going over the headlines, which I had already 
read about in the paper. Surfed for a while, did not find any
thing interesting. I turned it off. I lay down and started read
ing the newspaper again. I read this article on the National 
TV-Turnoff week. It was really interesting. It was intended 
to bring the number of TV watchers down for a week. The 
idea was to spend the time you would have spent watching 
TV on reading and/or being creative or, or, or... I was 
asleep before the last paragraph, 
dreamed... I started reading some of the news out loud to Dan. 
He said Dude, I am watching cartoons. Can you read it to your
self? I get off my bed. I screamed Did you know its National 
TV-Turnoff week? He responded NO, so? I picked up the TV 
and threw it on the ground. Then I started bashing it with my 
baseball bat. He was shocked. Before I knew anything, the TV was 
gone with the wind. I said So there, do something else now. Dan 
was crying and saying My cartoons...
