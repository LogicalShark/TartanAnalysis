MR. ADVERTISER
Do you really know the advertising 
value of a school paper? Do you 
realize that Carnegie Tech is the larg
est technical school in the United 
Statesnot going to be any more, but 
IS? Do you realize that 2500 students 
are enrolled hereenough to make a 
good sized town with no children or 
old people? Do you know that The 
Tartan is its only student paper and 
appears 36 times during the school 
year? Now, Mr. Advertiser, dont you 
think rt would pay to let these young 
money spenders (three-fourths are 
men) know what you have to sell? For

Lehigh Wins Game
Tech lost a hard fought battle to Lehigh last 
Saturday but the team is to be congratulated upon 
the fine showing they made. In the first half they 
played the South Bethlehem lads off their feet. In 
spite of their superior weight they were only able 
to beat our team by one touchdown. Coldren was 
easily the star for Tech, although Hittner, Flick and 
Marshal played brilliant ball. Coldrens run in the 
second half was the prettiest seen on the field this 
year. He caught an onside kick and ran around left 
end for a touchdown. Hittner gave him fine inter
ference, taking off three men, which enabled Coldren 
to get away. Dolin followed the ball well and 
secured the majority of fumbles. Next Saturday the 
team plays Franklin and Marshall and ought to win 
if they get an even break in the luck.
First Half.
Morris kicked off for Tech and Lehigh ran it 
back 5 yards. Marshal got through on the next 
play and threw the runner for a loss of 10 yards.

other kick and tore 9 yards through the line on the 
next play. Tech held and Lehigh kicked to Coldren 
who eluded both ends and ran back 35 yards. Tech 
lost 15 yards on a forward pass but got back 30 
yards on the next play. Lehigh secured the ball but 
was forced to kick to Hittner, who got back 15 yards.

THE F. & M. GAME.
On Saturday, November 6th, we play F. and M. 
in football. A little earlier in the season F. and M. 
beat Lehigh, but since that time Lehigh has greatly 
improved. On Saturday we played Lehigh in what 
was without a doubt the best foot ball game played 
in Pittsburgh this year. Saturday promises to bring 
forth another dandy game and it is up to the fellows 
to come out and do their share.
The cheering at the Lehigh game was good, the 
best that we have had this year. But let us improve 
upon that. We can do it. It has been done. It only 
needs a little effort on the part of each man and 
surely it is not too much to expect. Let every Tech 
man make it a point to get in the Tech rooting 
section, with a box of throat ease if necessary, and 
root until the game is won.

THE LEHIGH-TECH
In the cuts given below every play made in the 
Lehigh-Tech game last Saturday is given. To read 
the diagram begin at the top and work down the 
page, following the path of the ball as indicated by 
the different lines. For the meaning of the different 
lines used see the bottom of the first cut. The
GAME DIAGRAMED.
player that carried the ball is denoted by the letters 
that usually indicate his position.
It will be seen that in the first half Tech made 
more first downs than Lehigh and that more ground 
was gained. In the second half Lehigh came back 
stronger and won out by playing straight foot ball 
with a heavy back field.

6THE TARTAN
Thursday morning, about ten oclock, the various 
classes were disturbed by five strokes of the bell, 
which to us means a gathering in the Assembly room. 
Books, papers and pencils were immediately dropped 
as their owners quickly answered the summon.
It was not a surprise for everybody when we 
heard that Director Hamerschlag had come to talk 
to us, and yet the fact that we expected him at any 
time did not detract from our pleasure on seeing 
him.
For twenty minutes we listened attentively to a 
beautiful talk about the values of friendship, and of 
woman, and how she can be worth her weight in 
gold.
Later, after we had again settled down to study, 
the Director visited each class room in order to see 
us at our occupations.
The first meeting of the Dramatic Club was held 
October 28. It was merely a preliminary meeting at 
which Dean West explained to the new girls the 
object and interests of the club. On Thursday, No
vember 4, the first business meeting will be held, 
and all those Seniors or Juniors who wish to become 
members must be there. Reading of the constitution 
and signing for membership will be carried out, and 
nominations and elections for officers will be made 
then. The organizing must be finished up without 
delay, because it is already late in the year to begin 
study.
Miss ArrowsmithMiss Bilhman, how do you 
syllablize knowledge?
Miss BilhmanKnow-ledge.
Miss ArrowsmithThat is wrong.
Miss BilhmanI saw it in a book that way.
Miss ArrowsmithThen it was a bad book.
Miss BilhmanNo, it was the catechism.
GLEE AND MANDOLIN CLUBS.
The rehearsal last Sunday was not so well at
tended as it might have been probably due to the 
architects clarette.
Manager King was out of town last week working 
up his Christmas week trip. He reports that he has 
made up a schedule that will keep the clubs busy 
for a week at least and that he was very well re
ceived where ever he went. This promises a royal 
good time to those who are so fortunate as to take 
the trip.
There are places still open and any one who 
wants to have a trial can come to the general as
sembly room in the fi & J. building on Sunday at 
3 p. m. Let every person who can sing or play come 
out and help make the club the best ever.
THE SLIDE RULEWITH EXERCISES FOR 
BEGINNERS.
CUBES AND CUBE ROOTS. Cubes are found by 
squaring and then multiplying by the number itself. 
This is shown by the diagram of Fig. 11.

Bover a
Cset 1
Dover a
Fig 11. Cubes of Numbers.
The reader should verify this by trying some num
ber, say 2, and thus see that the correct result 8 is 
obtained.
Cube roots are found by reversing the above pro
cess. The steps are shown by the diagram of Fig.
12. The slide is moved until the given number a 
and the end of C scale, are both over the same num
ber. This is easily done by trial.

DLog. Ch.  3(3 n + 1)(3 n + 2)
Fig 12. Cube Roots of Numbers.
Any number may have three different cube roots, 
depending on the position of the decimal point. 
These may be determined by inspection, or by this 
rule:
If the logarithmic characteristic is a multiple of 3, 
the result is found on the left hand third of the D 
scale; if a multiple of 3, plus 1, the result lies on the 
middle third of the D scale; if a mutiple of 3, plus 2, 
the result lies on the right third of the D scale.
For example 3V 1500 (log. ch. = 3) the result is 
on the left hand of D scale, and is 11.45. But for 3V 
15000 (log. ch. = 4) the result lies on the middle 
third of D scale, and is 24.7.
When any expression contains cubes or cube roots 
as factors, it is best u> deal with these terms first, 
and then perform the remaining steps. For example,
24.8 X 3F36 = 81.8
The diagram for this problem is
Aunder 36
Bfind x
Cunder 1under 248
Dfind xfind 81.8
Here the cube root of 36 is found first, and the 
quotient multiplied by 24.8, all requiring only one set
ting of the slide.

Notes on Exercise 10. (4) Divide 7.64 by 6.8 first,
using C, D scales, then cube quotient and use remain
ing factors on the A, B scales. (5) Perform the 
operations within the parenthesis first, using C, D 
scales, then cube the result. (8) Log. ch. equals 1; 
hence find result on middle third of D scale. (10) 
Extract the cube root first, then multiply by 1.92. 
(11) Divide 1 by 197.3 on A, B scales, find cube root 
of the result and multiply by 27.6.
The time required for solving this exercise on the 
slide rule is 11 minutes.
SINES AND COSINES. The preceding articles 
have described the use of the front scales, called A, 
B, C, D, for convenience of reference. On the back 
of the slide are three additional scales which are 
brought into sight by turning the slide over and in
serting it bottom face up. The upper scale, marked
2 = 1.2 6 j/ 20 = 2.72
f/ 200 = 5.85
I.Q2 X t3/ 6750 = 36.3
27.6= 4-75

38-9
Expressions involving any of these functions as 
factors can also be worked simply on the slide rule. 
As an illustration take the familiar trigonometric 
problem of a triangle having one side and two angles 
given.
Let a=1.36, A=57.2, B=48.1. Required b.
By the law of sines a: b=sin A: sin B, whence by 
inserting numbers and solving for b.

b =-------------------- 12.05
sin 57.2
The diagram for solving this problem is given in 
Fig. 15. The steps are exactly like a similar expres
sion in ordinary numbers; in fact the trigonometric 
functions of an angle can be used just as easily as 
any other numbers.
A | Under 1 (right or center) I find cosec x A I Under 1 I find sec 1
S | set angle x j over 1
Fig. 14, SECANTS
S, gives the sines of angles. It is used by making 
the ends coincide with the A scale after which the 
sine is found on the A scale opposite the angle in 
degrees on the S scale. To verify this look for the 
angle 30 and find its sine 0.5.
For angles between 6 .90 (right hand side) sine 
is from 0.1 to 1.0.
For angles between 35' 6 (left hand side) sine is 
from 0.01 to 0.1.
For angles less than 35' the sine of 1 can be 
divided proportionately to give the sine of such small 
angles, care being taken to locate the correct position 
of the decimal point.
The cosine can be found by looking up the sine of 
the complimentary angle, since cos x=sin (90-x).
The foregoing directions can be compactly stated by 
the diagram of Fig. 13.

THE TECH NIGHT A GRAND SUCCESS.
Everybody who was wise enough to get in on the 
Tech Night at the Nixon Theater last Saturday even
ing certainly had their moneys worth of fun and 
saw a good show in the bargain. A large delegation 
of Tech men turned out and made things lively dur
ing the evening with songs and cheers. Both of the 
football teams were there, the Lehigh team being in 
the right-hand box and the Tech team in the left. 
The Theatre was decorated with Lehigh and Tech 
flags and colors. During the play the actors carried 
and wore flags. The elephant, Imogene, came on in 
the last act wearing a huge Tech banner. Mr. 
Arbuckle was called upon for a speech and he very 
gracefully responded.
A hearty vote of thanks is due to Manager Kirke 
and his employees for their assistance in furnishing 
so enjoyable an evening.

EDITORIAL
THE DIRECTORS RETURN.
Director Hamerschlag has regained enough of his 
strength to come back to us again. On Friday last 
he informally addressed all of the student bodies. 
He spoke of his great pleasure at being able to be 
with us again, and to feel that he was a working 
part of our institution.
We wish the Director the quickest possible re
gaining of the vigor that characterised him of old 
and are sorry that we cannot show him in a fitting 
manner how glad we are that he is again among 
us.
THE LEHIGH GAME.
The Lehigh game has come and gone. While we 
went down to defeat we have nothing of which to be 
ashamed; on the contrary, we have much of 
which to be proud. We played the game and lost 
to a better, a heavier, and an older team. ThS 
game was exceptionally clean and fast and was the 
most interesting one of the year from the spectators 
point of view.
Why not make the Lehigh game an annual fix
ture on our football schedule? It is time that Tech 
was establishing permanent athletic relations and 
not jumping from one college to another each year. 
In Lehigh we are always sure of the calibre of our 
adversary; a clean, gentlemanly team which can 
always be depended upon to furnish an interesting 
encounter.
FOOTBALL AND THE GRIM REAPER.
As we go to press, newspapers throughout the 
country are vigorously denouncing football on ac
count of the death of an Army man and the serious, 
almost hopeless, condition of two others from the 
game. We do not defend or attempt to justify the 
damage that has been done. Football is a manly 
sport, it develops many of the qualities that go to 
make up a strong man. Baseball does some of these 
things and many deaths and injuries resulted from it 
which did not bring forth such volleys of condemna
tion as have been pouring from the American press 
with reference to foot ball. There is danger in all 
manly sports; perhaps we might go even farther and 
say that as the possibilities for the development of 
manliness increase, so does the element of danger 
which does not mean that we would have this applied 
in the extreme and beyond the limit of common 
sense.
We extend our heartiest and most profound sym
pathy to West Point, Annapolis, and the MedicoChirurgical College of Philadelphia on the regretable 
and unfortunate results of games played by their 
men. In the face of this, our own remarkable record 
of no Tech mans injury or exhaustion being the 
cause of one second of time being taken out, makes 
a happy and fortunate contrast.
COVER COMPETITION CLOSES FRIDAY.
The competition announced some weeks ago for a 
new cover design for The Tartan is nearing a close. 
Designs will be received in the office of the School 
of Applied Design until noon on Friday, and the 
judgment will be made as soon after as is con
venient for the jury. Dean McGoodwin, Mr. Fenand, 
Mr. Sparks and Mr. Hewlett have been invited to 
serve with the editors of this paper as a jury, and 
Mr. Campbell to be present and participate in the

HAPPENINGS ELSEWHERE.
The Glee Club at the University of Chicago had 65 
candidates out.
The debaters in the Alpha Nu Society of Michigan 
were unable to settle the Cook-Perry case. The con

the pole, while Dr. Cook may or may not have been 
the real discoverer.
The annual Tech night at Boston will be held on 
November 5th. The show will be Elsie Janis in 
the Pair Co-ed.
Boston Tech has reorganized their employment 
bureau, making it more effective than ever before. 
The purpose of this bureau is to help needy students 
to find employment for their spare hours.
The Student Cadet Battalion of the New Mexico 
Agricultural College presented arms in honor of 
President Taft, when the presidential party passed 
through on the Sante Fe railroad.
The University of Minnesota is to give a carnival 
in the form of a circus.
Columbia College is making a strenuous effort to 
regain some of her lost prestige in college sports and 
a plan has been practically agreed upon whereby 
the Blue and White will be once more seen to the 
fore. During the coming year $18,000 will be avail
able to encourage sports at Columbia. It is figured 
that few important victories will create an interest 
that will spread among the undergraduates. Colum
bia was at one time an important factor on the grid
iron when Foster Sandford was coach and she also 
shewed distinction on the water.
The Freshman Co-ed Class at the University of 
Michigan is probably the most enthusiastic that has 
ever entered the University. The class desires the 
adoption of a regulation Freshman cap.
The University of Kansas has just refused to ad

In the course of his address last Thursday the 
Director said that the students here were no longer 
childrenbut that they were adults. This state
ment must have been a decided shock to a number 
of paper-wad throwers in the audience.
We are glad we never got as far along in Calculus

During the Lehigh game some of the rooters de
manded, vociferously, that the Brown and White 
coach should vacate the playing field. This, of 
course, did not sound very well. However, we may 
remark in passing that Mr. Snitjer gave the 
Lehigh rooters no opportunity to make similar de
mands.

THE TARTANil
THE SCRUBS
An Appreciation
We all know what a wonderful game our boys 
have put up all season. And again in last Saturdays 
game our team shone brilliantly and if we had not 
been so unfortunate in the matter of fumbles we 
would have annexed this game, too. Now, what is 
it that is making the team such a success? In the 
writers opinion there are four factors which so 
depend on each other that it will be hard to say 
which is the most important.
First, there is the question of a suitable coach. 
This puzzle has been admirably solved by the work 
of Coach Snitjer. Strict, but impartial, he works 
the team hard and allows no loafing. But his spirit 
of comradeship when off the field has won the men 
to him and makes it a pleasure to carry out his 
command.
A coach must have material to work with. This 
constitutes the second element of our successthe 
team itself. Working hard, denying themselves 
many minor pleasures, our team has at last found 
itself. No matter how good the material there must 
be unison of action to have a successful team. In 
other words, we must have teamwork to win games. 
This is itself evident to anyone who will compare 
the work of the team in the game with Western 
Reserve, with their work in the game against West
minster.
But in order to develop this team work, which is 
so important, the Varsity must have practice 
against worthy opponents. So we come to the third, 
and one of the most important elements to the 
Varsitys successthe Scrubs.
That word should be written with capitals a foot 
high. Coming out day after day with but faint hope 
cf getting a Varsity berth, being pushed and pulled 
around by the heavier first team, yet doing all with 
a fervor and joyful spirit because its for Tech. 
By their consistent work and laudable spirit they 
have given Tech a team of which she is justly 
proud. Honor the Scrubs, give them their true share 
in the glory. As I said before, each of these factors 
are so interwoven that one cannot say which is the 
most important, but whae we are giving the team 
and their coach due praise, let us not forget the 
men who are in the backgroundthose without 
whom the masterpiece would be a failure.
Finally, the support of the student body is
essential in making a winning team. This has been
done admirably so far, but there is always room
for improvement. And so, fellows, lets all work
together and turn out the best team.

THE LAY OF THE LAST SOPHOMORE
It has been said, that a Sophomore lad,
Had too much Math to do,
And the time he spent, and the way things went 
Put him clean off his flue.
For If the sin of X plus the sin of Y,
Over the twentieth power of Z,
Is the square of P plus the half I,
What would the equation be?
To a dance one day, (so goes the lay),
This bughouse Sophomore went;
But to get a dance, he had no chance,
For in this his time he spent.
If the step to the right is the ordinate,
To the left is the square of P,
And the waltzs curve is the figure eight,
What would the equation be?
To the football game, with the crowd he came,
To help the rooters cheer;
But at Hittners run, then he begun,
And this is what we hear:
If Billy dodges a dozen men,
And a yard is the abscissa,
In what high power of X and Y 
Would his paths equation be?
In the funny house, as still as a mouse,
He sits now day by day,
Till his tense nerves break, and your breath you 
take
When you hear the poor boy say,
If the square of X on the new full moon,
On the sin of P plus E,
Is half a lemon and half a prune,
What would a honey bee?
One Who Knows.

The Committee on Constitution and By-Laws held 
a meeting on Thursday evening and hope to have 
their documents drawn up at an early date.
It was with much pleasure that the members of 
the Draftsmens Club heard the remarks of Edward 
Mercer, 89, of the University of Virginia, and his 
pal, Tom Farmer, whose life began five years 
and seven months ago. Their stories were not 
pleasant ones and must have cost the speakers a 
great effort, but the moral lesson they taught was 
simply and forcibly brought home and should leave 
a lasting impression on all who were so fortunate 
as to be present. We are told that to err is 
human, but to err when the danger has been 
pointed out, as it was done by these two, is just 
common foolishness.

He might have been dreaming, perhaps he was. 
Disconnected fragments concerning football, Yale,
St. Louis and fake plays paraded themselves before 
his subconscious mind. It was a heaven bounded 
by wide marks of white lime on fields of green turf 
and the angelic choruses rah-rahed from the many 
bleachers banking the Elysian fields. ' The climax 
was reached at 7:45 on a Thursday morning.
The coach continued his peaceful slumbers as the 
room filled with spectators crowding to get places 
of advantage from where they could well view what 
was about to happen. It was the coachs turn to be 
really caught by an old prep, school trick. Then 
the signal was given and the coach, still asleep, was 
seen to give a mighty leap, straight into the air. As 
he neared the highest point in his second flight his 
eyes suddenly snapped open and his efforts to es
cape what had entraped him became truly heroic.
He would balance himself neatly on the back of his 
neck, raise himself up on his heels, and then give 
an imitation of a measuring-worm working over
time. After a series of short jumps he bounded out 
of bed and lit on his ear on the floor. Getting up 
quickly and placing as much territory between him
self and the bed as was possible, he gasped, My 
God, another earthquake. Any one who can inform 
the coach what really happened will greatly oblige 
a number of his friends.

THE CIVIL-ELECTRICAL GAME.
The first game for the sectional supremacy of the 
Sophomore class was played last Friday on Leeds 
Field. The game was spectacular and brimful of in
terest for the spectators and ended in a well deserved 
victory for the Civils.
The first half was very evenly fought. Stone shone 
for the Electricals, making big gains through the 
Civil line. Allen saved the Civil goal by his fine 
punting, always managing to get the ball out of 
the danger zone.
In the second half the Electricals scored, a punt 
being blocked and going back of the Civil goal line 
where it was fallen upon by Lindberg. Schmucker 
failed to kick the goal. Upon the kick-off the Civils 
got their onside kick working and Rex carried the 
ball to the Electricals 5 yard line on a 40 yard run. 
McCully was pushed over and Rex kicked the goal. 
No more scoring was done. The line-up:
