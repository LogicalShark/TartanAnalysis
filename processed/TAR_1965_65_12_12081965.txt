100 Pints 
Of Blood  
Pledged
More than 100 pints of 
blood have been pledged to 
the Tech Blood Drive for 
Wounded Americans in 
Vietnam after the first 
week of this six-week cam
paign. This initial response 
has stimulated predictions 
that the campus effort will well-exceed the 500-pledge 
goal.
Students who wish to make a 
pledge should sign the adjacent 
pledge slip and deliver it to the 
Drive desk in Baker Hall lobby 
any day between 11:30 a.m. and 
1:30 p.m.
Tentative dates for the donation 
of blood have been set as January 
10, 11 and possibly 12, if more 
than 500 pledges are received. 
Students contributing should ar
range in advance to be excused 
from any classes conflicting with 
their appointment time. They 
should give themselves at least an 
hour and forty-five minutes.
Coordinated by Sigma Alpha Ep
silon fraternity, the Tech Blood 
Drive has received full support 
from ROTC department, Student 
Congress, the Council of Frater
nity Presidents and Mens Dor
mitory Council. Drive coordina
tor, Bob Cooper, has asked that all 
campus organizations actively 
support the program. Says Coop
er: The drive is not associated 
with any national political organi
zation, agitation group or govern
ment agency. It is strictly con
cerned with saving the lives of 
wounded Americans in Viet
nam.
All plasma extract obtained will 
be shipped to the Department of 
Defense and in turn, to Vietnam.
Womens Dorm Govt Aims Calendar Poll Found
To Activate Commuters
In a Womens Dormitory Council meeting held to 
elect commuter representatives to Executive Council 
and Judiciary of womens government, Beth Carten, 
president, discussed the needs of Morewood residents 
and the Association of Womens (previously called 
Womens Dormitory Council) responsibility to non
resident students.
Miss Carten pointed to the role that the female 
student must now play in the university and explained 
that the needs and problems presented by the women 
at Carnegie Tech must be met by their student govern
ment organizations.
In order to meet these demands 
Miss Carten made the suggestion 
that Carnegie Tech Womens Dor
mitory Council become a member 
of the Intercollegiate Association 
of Women Students, an organiza
tion of 125 colleges throughout the 
United States. The laws would 
serve as a resource for informa
tion, Miss Carten said. It would 
be a means by which we might learn 
how the special educational needs 
of women students are being met 
on other college campuses. She 
explained, however, that the Car
negie Tech Association of Women 
will have to operate for two years 
before it becomes eligible to join 
the national organization.
Miss Carten questioned the com
muters awareness of those facili
ties provided for them in Skibo and 
the Margaret Morrison lounge. She 
asked whether or not these facili
ties were adequate and whether 
the commuter's would be wiling 
to work at improving and expand
ing them.
She also reminded the com
muters about those facilities avail
able for their use in Morewood 
Gardens (a ditto machine, sewing 
machine, television sets and a hifi listening room). She mentioned 
that women can spend the night at 
Morewood on a rollawaybedfor$l, 
to cover linen.
Miss Carten continued her
Bridge Team Takes 2nd 
In Collegiate Tournament
Members of Carnegie Techs bridge team finished 
second in the recent Queen City Collegiate Invita
tional Bridge Tournament held at the University of 
Cincinnati.
Participating in the two-session board-a-match 
event were 25 teams from 15 colleges and univer
sities.
Sponsors were the Xavier Uni
versity and University of Cincin
nati Bridge Clubs, with technical 
assistance from the United States 
Playing Card Company.
Miami, O. University won the 
tournament, with Cincinnati and 
Tennessee tied for third. Car
negie Tech team members were 
John Welte, senior, chemistry; 
Dennis Thompson, graduate, che
mical engineer; Chris James, sen
ior, electrical engineer; and Bill 
Anderson, graduate, math, who won 
his required points to become a 
life master.
For finishing second the Car
negie Tech team members each 
received an 11-inch trophy plus all 
playing expenses for any two ses
sions at the Marchr 1966 Spring 
National Tournament In Louisville, 
Kentucky.
A general information ses
sion on securing summer jobs 
will be held in the Skibo Wherrett Room tomorrow at 3:30 
P.m.
Orchestra 
Fall Concert
The Carnegie College - Com
munity Orchestra of Carnegie Tech 
will present its first concert of 
the season on Saturday, December 
11, at 8;30 p.m. in Carnegie Mu
sic Hall.
Maurice Laney, associate pro
fessor and assistant head of the 
music department, is conductor 
of the orchestra.

ductor for the concert and will con
duct the Kodaly work. Mr. Harth is 
head of the Music Department at 
Carnegie Tech and Andrew Mellon 
Professor of music.

clude students in the Department of 
Music and qualified musicians 
from the Pittsburgh area.
The program will include works 
by Weber, Barber, Beethoven, and 
Kodaly. The concert is admission-free and open to the public.
speech by discussing residentcommuter relationships. She felt 
that all women students should 
be more integrated and exchange 
ideas; that together, residents and 
non-residents should plan social 
events. She suggested that a'lecture series be initiated by the wom
en, for example. This series could 
have as its theme, The Role of 
the Educated Woman in American 
Society, or it could involve dis
cussions by special interest 
groups.
Students must work together 
in dormitory government to esta
blish a procedure for the use of the 
facilities best for all concerned.
In discussing dormitory finan
ces she said: Presently the sole 
source of income for the dormi
tory council is the commission 
from the vending machines in 
Morewood Gardens. There is no 
allocation from the University. 
She spoke of the proposed acti
vities fee.
The meeting was concluded with 
the discussion of election proce
dures for representation to dormi
tory council by non-residents. Two 
upperclassmen would be elected to 
Executive Council and one to Judi
ciary; and one freshman would be 
elected to each body.
There are approximately 700 
residents in Morewood Gardens 
and less than 200 commuter stu
dents, seventy of whom are fresh
men.
Musuem Displays 
Israeli Artwork
Art Israel: 26 Painters and 
Sculptors, the first major exhi
bition of contemporary Israeli art 
to be shown in the United States, 
is now on display at the Carnegie 
Institute Museum of Art.
William C. Seitz, a curator of 
the Museum of Modern Art in New 
York, selected the exhibition after 
viewing the work of over seven 
hundred artists. He points out two 
recurring themes which pervade 
Israeli art: The tragic, and in
tensely felt identification with Jew
ish tradition and its recent trials; 
and the lyrical, the expressionof a 
lighthearted love of country, which 
takes its form in the celebration 
of nature,
The exhibit opened on November 
30th and will continue until Decem
ber 26.
carnegrient her FdiyDr
All students who wish to sub
mit art work or written material 
for Patterns 1966 are urged to do 
so before the end of the fall semes

This deadline has been set so 
that the magazine staff may have 
adequate time to make personal and

As Unsatisfactory
Tabulation of the results from the student opinion 
poll on the Carnegie Tech calendar, which appeared 
in the last issue of the Tartan, indicates that the 
majority of the students favor the Penn B calendar 
over the present calendar and the ad hoc proposal.
According to Stephen D. Bak
er, junior, chemical engineering, 
and chairman of the Calendar Com
mittee of Student Congress, 400 re
sponses to the poll were receiv
ed. Of these, 100 were invalidated 
on grounds of ballot box stuffing, 
114 voted entirely for the Penn B 
calendar, 35 for the present calen
dar, and 5 for the ad hoc proposal.
The remainder of the ballots 
suggested various mixtures of the 
calendars. 21 students voted for the 
Penn B plan with the inclusion of 
a half day break in classes before 
Homecoming. A plurality voted 
for the provision in the ad hoc 
calendar with regard to combin
ing the spring and Easter reces
ses. Although other mixtures ap
peared on the rest of the ballots, 
most of them were not feasible.
The administration, according 
to Baker, was not impressed with 
the magnitude of the student re
sponse to the poll, and does not 
believe the results are neces
sarily indicative of the student 
consensus regarding the calen
dar situation.

Hewlett Display Features 
Libby Lithographs, Reliefs
The works of William Charles Libby, associate! 
professor in painting, design and sculpture at Car
negie Tech, are now being featured in the Fine Arts 
Hewlett Gallery.Included in the display are lithographs from a bird 
series that Libby completed while in the West Indies,, 
several works made of abrasive materials, and exam
ples of a new type of relief that Libby has experiment
ed with for the past year and a half.
The lithographs are often mistaken for paintings because of Lib
by's superimposition of colors and 
his off-setting of images. The 
definite outlines in the composi
tions are thereby somewhat dis
torted.
Color in the abrasive material 
designs was achieved by Libby's 
use of colored pencils on the highly 
textured material.
Libby uses cardboard construc
tions to illustrate his experimental 
low relief sculpture.
He claims that the most impor
tant aspect of his experimental 
works is illumination. With his type 
of art, light is external, whereas 
in a painting lighting is internalbuilt into the picture.
In Libby's works, the construc
tion looks different each time the 
lighting is changed, or even as the 
observer walks by. There is a play 
of shadows, and vibrating whites 
against the shadow that seem to.

terns and add depth to the white 
cardboard.
Libby plans to continue his ex
perimentation with color sculp
tures of the same type. He be

ONeill,Wilder
Featured 
At Strand
A Film-festival Week, at the 
Strand Theatre in Oakland, will 
feature two films based on plays 
by noted authors-Eugene O'Neill 
and Thornton Wilder on December 
8 to 11.
The ONeill play, Desire Un
der the Elms," one of the first of 
the New Wave of more mature, 
more controversial films, was 
produced in 1958.
Critic Arthur Knight explains: 
As little as a year earlier the 
studios would not have touched 
such a theme ... its lack of 
compromise, frankness of lang
uage and situation probably start
led the producers themselves . . 
no attempt to dodge or conceal 
such unlikely movie fare as incest, 
infanticide, naked greed and naked 
hate between father and son."
Directed by Delbert Mann with 
script by Irwin Shaw, the {day's 
cast includes: Sophia Loren, An
thony Perkins, Burl Ives, Frank 
Overten, Pernell Roberts, Ann 
Seymour and Greta Granstedt.
Thorton Wilder's The Match
maker," which started on Broad
way as a long-run comedy hit, is 
now back on Broadway in musical 
form as Hello Dolly." The 
screen version presents Shirley 
Booth in the Carol Channing role 
of the widow. The cast includes 
Anthony Perkins, Paul Ford, Rob
ert Morse, and Wallace Ford, An 
intimate play about love and mar
riage, the film marked the screen 
comedy debut for Academy Awardwinning actress Shirley Booth and 
dramatic star Anthony Perkins.
The features will begin at 8:40 
p.m. nightly and will cost $1.
SnS Holds 
Auditions For 
Nouveau
Auditions will be held by 
Scotch n Soda for its 1966 
production Nouveau, 
Friday, December 10 from 
4:30 p.m. to 7 p.m. and Sat
urday, December 11 from 2 
p.m. to 6 p.m. in the Skibo 
Wherrett Room.Nouveau" is a musical come
dy about the aesthetics and inte
grity of art, in particular, of one 
artist in California today.
There are four principal char
acters, who must be able to sing 
and dance. The cast also includes 
seven featured parts and a chorus 
of about 18 or 20.
Those who audition will be ex
pected to perform with a ballad 
and a fast or up number. Those in
terested are advised to bring sheet 
music; a pianist will be provided. 
Also, auditionees will be asked 
to read for various parts in Nou
veau". If anyone is interested in 
dancing, a short number or exer
cise should be prepared.
Rehearsals for Nouveau" will 
not begin until March 1966. Re
hearsals for the principal charac
ters, however, will begin earlier 
with song rehearsals.
The purpose of having auditions 
so far in advance is to facilitate 
the orchestration of show num
bers, and the design and prepara
tion of costumes.
It is suggested that those in
terested in auditioning come early. 
Some people interested in working 
on the technical staffs should sign 
up during audition times outside 
the Wherrett Room.

The ad hoc calendar committee, created last semes

problem at Carnegie Tech, met recently to delibe
rate over recommendations pertaining to the calendar 
for the academic year 1966-67. Although the commit
tee did not arrive at a final decision regarding which 
calendar it will submit for approval to the Administra
tive Council, most members of the committee, compos
ed of several representatives of the administration 
and faculty, and one student representative, apparent
ly strongly favor the ad hoc proposal, which was pre
sented in the Tartan with the Penn B and present 
Carnegie Tech calendars prior to Thanksgiving recess. 
The Penn B calendar, however, which has been widely 
supported among the students, received little conside
ration by the committee.
According to committee chairman Dr. Robert J. Kibbee, Carnegie Tech vice president for planning, the 
philosophy with which the ad hoc committee has ap
proached the calendar problem is to try and establish 
a calendar system which possesses the greatest po
tential for the enhancement of the academic programs, 
simultaneously eliminating those features of the 
present calendar which have proved detrimental to the 
implementation of dynamic curricula. It is generally 
agreed by students, faculty, and administrators that 
one of the most salient of these detrimental features 
is the short period of classes squeezed between 
Christmas recess and the beginning of final examina
tions. Obviously, there are two possible alternative 
remedial measures which might be undertaken to ame
liorate this situation: the period of classes may either 
be lengthened, or eliminated entirely. The ad hoc pro
posal provides for the former; the Penn B, the latter.
The Penn B plan has received widespread support 
among the students primarily because, with the elimi
nation of the days of class after vacation, the calen
dar provides for the termination of the first semester 
with the start of Christmas recess. After considera
tion of such a plan, the student anticipates a vacation 
which is a true vacation, free from the anxieties associated with completing term papers and projects 
due after the recess, free from studying for examina
tions, consequently allowing more complete enjoyment 
of the vacation period.
In light of this prospect, the student may question 
what purpose can be served by adopting the ad hoc 
proposal instead of the Penn B calendar. Concomitant 
with the committees philosophy described above, the 
committee members, according to Dr. Kibbee, con
ceive of ultimately considering the academic year as a 
single block of time, rather than regarding it as two 
well defined, entirely separated semesters. Such a sys
tem would permit the various colleges and depart
ments, whose widely divergent academic curricula

of Carnegie Institute of Technology.
each pose unique scheduling difficulties, to subdivide 
the academic year into units of any convenient 
and appropriate length. The calendar, therefore, would 
allow scheduling to be designed to suit the curricula, 
not the curricula organized to suit the schedule, as 
is now the case. Furthermore, this system would call 
for the elimination of final examinations as a formal 
institution. The ad hoc calendar committee, according 
to Dr. Kibbee, visualizes its current proposal as r 
transition between the present system and the one 
just described.
The Penn B calendar, however, serves only to make 
more rigid the separation of the academic year into 
two semesters, and could never rival the potential flex
ibility incorporated into the ad hoc proposal.
Even when viewed from a more narrowly circum
scribed and less objectivized vantage point, the ad hoc 
proposal possesses several advantages over the pre
sent calendar as to disrupt the continuity of the 
curricula. First, it provides for the solution of the 
problem associated with the overly short class period 
between the Christmas vacation and final examina
tions by lengthening it. This provides more time during 
which to complete term papers and projects, and to 
administer hour examinations, thus alleviating the 
work load over Christmas recess. Second, it calls 
for deferring the beginning of the academic year one 
week, but does not require deferment of the end of 
the year, thereby lengthening summer vacation, Fur
thermore, it is noteworthy that a plurality of the re
sponses to the calendar poll recently published in the 
Tartan (the results of which appear on page one of this 
issue) favored the provision in the ad hoc proposal to 
combine the spring recess with the Easter weekend. 
Finally, it provides for two hour rather than three hour 
finals.
In adhering to its philosophy that the calendar 
must enhance the academic curricula, the committee 
favors the ad hoc proposal over the Penn B calendar, 
and in so doing, it is choosing the proper course. It 
would certainly be most unrealistic, were the com
mittee to apply as a criterion for judging the relative 
merits of the proposed calendars, the desirabilities 
of the various associated vacation periods. Further
more, in considering its proposal as a transition be
tween the present calendar and the highly flexible 
system which it has conceived for the future, the com
mittee is displaying the dynamism and adaptiveness 
vital to the maintenance of the high standards of a uni
versity.
Next week, the ad hoc calendar committee is to make 
its final decision regarding which calendar it will sub
mit to the Administrative Council for approval. The 
Tartan advocates the adoption of the ad hoc proposal, 
and anticipated its implementation during the 1966-67 
academic year.
The original ad hoc proposal which recently appear
ed in the Tartan did, in fact, provide for the elimination 
of final examinations. In response to strong objections 
voiced by the academic affairs committee, however, 
the calendar committee modified its proposal to include 
a five day period of two hour final examinations in each semester.

Education

and Taxation
Tuition at Tech has been in
creasing alarmingly of late. Ten 
years ago we paid only $340 for 
a semester's education here and 
the tab stands now at $850 with 
no end in sight. The recent vote 
by the maintenance employees to 
join the Building Services Em
ployees Union, may, according to 
Mr. Strathmeyer, vice-president 
for Business Affairs, increase tui
tion again as much as $100. With 
the $1000 mark Just over the hori
zon, some serious thought should 
be given to alleviating the biannual 
bind of tuition payments at pri
vate institutions.
State supported schools, though, 
have managed to maintain stable 
tuition rates, through the absorp
tion of increased cost by the tax
payer, Penn State, for example,
charges $175 for tuition per term. 
Certainly, our nation is commit
ted to the ideal of equal opportu
nity through education, but our ap
proach to this ideal is dubious. 
If we allow mediocrity in educa
tion to displace excellence, we do a 
disservice to ourselves and to 
those for whom we are seeking 
equal opportunity.
The trend is self-evident. With 
the upward spiral of tuition at Tech 
and other private schools compar
ed to the stable state tuitions, 
the private university (and its tra
dition of advanced educational 
standards) is pricing itself out of 
the reach of the typical student or 
into the arms of state or federal 
control.
The only solution to the dilem
ma seems to lie in a revision of

Editor, the Tartan:
The time has come for the out
moded and dangerously inflexible 
regulations of Morewood Gardens 
to be seriously questioned and 
challenged. It was necessary for an 
unfortunate incident to occur to 
prove the inadequate provisions 
made by an incapable staff at the 
womens residence hall.
Last Sunday morning at 2:30 a.m. 
one of the freshman girls on our 
floor awoke crying to the point of 
hysteria. She was extremely feve
rish and complained of pains in her 
legs. One of us went down to get 
the nurse, while the other took the 
girl to her bed. The girl had a 
temperature ofl02 degrees and was 
unable to stand or walk without 
support. The nurse on duty refus
ed to leave the infirmary to go 
up to see the girl. Therefore, 
we asked the nurse for permis
sion to secure a private physician. 
We were told that we needed the 
head residents permission. We 
then called a private physician who 
said he would be right over.
We then went down to the main 
desk to inform the security officer 
of the predicament. He then called 
the head resident for permission 
to allow the physician to enter the 
dormitory and attend the girl. She 
asked to speak to one of us. She 
insisted that girls were pulling 
this all the time, and that any
one with fever could make it down 
to the infirmary. We tried to ex
plain the seriousness of the girls 
condition, but the resident head 
remained obstinate and wary of the 
situation. The security officer rea
lizing our helpless position con
tacted his chief. While he was 
speaking with the chief, the resi
dent head phoned the main desk and 
stated that under no circumstances 
was a doctor or the nurse to go up 
to the girls room.
The Chief of Security arrived 
at Morewood and phoned the resi
dent head. We explained the de
tails of the situation to him. Mrs. 
Thorpe came to the main desk 
and finally went upstairs to the 
girls room. It was now 3:30 a.m. 
At 3:45 a.m. the girl, supported 
by two friends was forced to come 
down to the infirmary. The girl had 
to be carried from E tower to D 
tower. The resident head then sent 
the four of us upstairs to our 
rooms. At 4 a.m. we phoned the 
main desk to find out whether or 
not the doctor had arrived. The se
curity officer informed us that the 
physician was with the girl.
One of the girls suddenly re
membered that the sick girl is 
allergic to penicillin. If that girl 
had not notified the infirmary im
mediately, no precaution would 
have been taken to find out whe
ther the girl was allergic to any

the internal revenue structure. 
Parents who send their children to

federal taxes, portions of which 
support city colleges, county com
munity colleges, state universi
ties, federal grants which in turn 
support all three, and federal ser
vice academies.
Certainly, its Important that 
everyone have the opportunity for 
higher education, but its not easy 
to understand for the student or 
parent straining to meet expen
ses in the better private educa
tional institutions. The Internal 
revenue system should, we think, 
be amended to allow parents or 
students to deduct private educa
tional expenses from their income 
tax, since the person financing 
a private education is doing his 
share for the good of society by 
providing a quality education for 
his child or himself.

For Understanding

Much criticism has been aim( ed at Student Congress over the 
' past few months, but I feel very 
little of it has been of a construc
tive nature. Many organizations 
have criticized student govern
ment in their attempts to protect 
their own interests, and this is 
their right, but there has been lit
tle attempt to isolate the basic 
problems.
One of the underlying problems 
. of Student Congress is that its 
purpose is not clear either to its 
members or the remaining portion 
of the college community. The 
lack of a well-defined purpose na
turally leads to muddled actions 
in the performance of its role on 
campus. This is the situation our 
Congress is in.
The following is an excerpt from 
the Codification of Policy of the 
. United States National Student As
sociation which describes the pur
pose of student government and 
the responsibilities which a student 
government should concern itself 
with.
The aims of higher educa
tion are to develop within the 
individual independence of 
thought, active awareness of and 
b participate in technical achie
vement. The individual is the 
center of learning. Therefore, 
these aims have meaning only 
insofar as they relate to the 
individual. Whatever is done in 
the educational community must
be evaluated in terms of the effect on the student and his learn
ing process. Student govern
ment, as the representative of 
| the student community, must be 
committed to these goals of 
higher education in order to 
justify its existence.
To attain the afore mention
ed purpose, the following re
sponsibilities must be assumed:
1. Create an atmosphere of 
freedom: allowing the student to 
move beyond the limits of tra
ditional interests; allowing the 
student to become a creative 
and contributing individual.
2. Aid In a meaningful inter
pretation of the concept of the 
college community. Effec
tive communication between 
members of the college commu
nity is vital to the understanding 
of this concept.
3. Provide services for the 
welfare of the student.
4. Provide opportunities for 
each student to participate in 
activities which developed and 
realize his potentialities.
5. Create an awareness of na
tional and international affairs 
and of their significance for 
the individual.
This excerpt describes a con
ception of student government  
the conception in which the mem
bers of NSA believe in and at
tempt to follow. I believe this con
ception is applicable to any uni
versity or college which places 
primary emphasis on the search 
for truth.
I recommend the adoption of 
this statement as the purpose of 
the student government of Carne
gie Tech and the rejection of the 
present purpose. Since a revised 
constitution is being prepared, now 
is the time for the consideration 
of this basic problem by all mem
bers of the college community. I 
strongly believe that if student 
congress is ever to be more than 
an ornament on the Carnegie Tech 
tree of knowledge, then this pro
blem must eventually be faced.

Editor, the Tartan:
With all the discussion about 
our athletic policy at Carnegie 
Tech the possible revision of many 
ideas, I though it would be about 
time to add to the list a matter 
which has been kicked around now 
for about two years, and about 
which little has been done until re
cently. This concerns a varsity 
lacrosse team.
For those who may not know, 
lacrosse is a team sport played 
in the spring, much along the same 
lines as soccer, basketball and 
hockey, and is the oldest Ameri
can sport, having come from the 
American Indians. For those who 
do know the game, it is possibly 
one of the most exciting sports 
there is. It would certainly gene
rate a lot of enthusiasm and school 
spirit around here in the spring.
First, I would like to summarize 
a proposal which I submitted to 
President Stever at the beginning 
of the year and which, to the best 
of my knowledge, surmounts every 
possible obstacle except the end
less quantity of red tape.
Ten men play on the field at one 
time. A team normally carries 
around twenty men. At the school 
right now there are at least thirty 
boys who play or have played and 
probably that many more who would 
like to learn.
Equipment Costs
The equipment for each player 
consists of a lacrosse stick, a 
helmet, arm pads, and padded 
gloves. Team equipment consists 
of two six by six goals and nets 
plus an ample quantity of lacrosse 
balls. The player normally owns 
his own stick, which costs about 
twenty dollars. He may or may 
not own some of the other equip
ment. This is up to the school to 
supply.
Had we acted when I first sub
mitted the proposal, the school 
would have been able to get, for 
nothing, the helmets, gloves, nets 
and balls from the United States 
Intercollegiate Lacrosse Associa
tion. We could have used this for a 
year and then returned it, still 
paying nothing, or bought it all or 
in part. The total cost would have 
come to 400 to 450 dollars for 
equipment retailing at about 600 
dollars. As it is, if we act right 
now, we still may be able to get 
this deal or a similar one. If not, 
we may have to pay full price.
Not too many people know what 
lacrosse is since it is a regional 
sport and has only recently begun 
spreading from Maryland. To help 
acquaint people with the game, 
I proposed that the boys who play 
put on a scrimmage during a foot
ball half-time, if it got that far. 
It is still possible, however, to 
put on a small scrimmage during 
a basketball half-time, even though 
lacrosse is an outdoor game.
Practice Grounds
Right now, what with football, 
track and intramural sports, the 
school lacks adequate playing area 
for practice and games. However, 
with the recent acquisition of five 
and one-half acres in Schenley 
Park, this problem could be sol
ved. All we need is a little quick 
action to prepare the field and to 
deal with the zoning problems 
which will undoubtedly arise.
As far as money goes, the school 
would have to pay for the equip
ment, training meals, transpor
tation, and a coach. If enough en
thusiasm is shown, I see no rea
son why the school could not lay 
out a little money into one of the 
fastest growing sports.
Coaching may be a problem. 
It is quite probable that none of 
our coaches know much about la
crosse. To solve this problem 
we could either teach them some
thing, find a coach who knows 
something  possibly a member 
of the defunct Pittsburgh lacrosse 
club  or coach it ourselves.
Competition In Ohio
As of this moment there are no 
schools in western Pennsylvania 
which play lacrosse, although the 
Association has been interested in 
getting it started. All the schools 
we would play are nearby in Eas
tern Ohio. These include: Oberlin, 
Wooster, Kenyon, Denison, Ohio 
State, Ohio Wesleyan, Ohio U. and 
possibly Baldwin Wallace. We al
ready play Wooster and Denison 
in varsity sports. The others could 
easily be added to our roster.
I think it is about time that 
this matter be brought up at an 
Athletic Committee meeting. I 
realize that the prime concern 
is first our football team and the 
athletic policy in general, but if we 
are to have any kind of spring 
sport, we must act now. At the 
last meeting of the Committee, 
lacrosse was completely ignored. 
Tomorrow the same thing may hap
pen.
Student Support
Anyone sharing the same con
cern with regard to varsity sports 
in the Spring should contact George 
K. Brown, dean of student affairs, 
or Frank M. Cratsley, athletic di
rector, or myself and let his 
feelings be known. Otherwise the 
idea may be battled around indefinately. All members of the ath
letic committee have copies of 
my proposal and I have talked 
with the people concerned. It's 
now up to the student body to 
voice its opinion and get the ball 
rolling before the revitalization 
of Tech sports loses its momen
tum.

Where were the Tech cheer
leaders on December 1 when the 
Tech basketball team almost beat 
Pitt (they lost 54-51)? All fall the 
cheerleaders have been cam
paigning for more school spirit, 
yet they didn't show up for one of 
the most important basketball 
games of the year.
President Stever made it to the 
game on crutches, the Bagpipers 
were represented, and a relative
ly large number of spirited Tech 
students showed up as is evident 
from the following quote from the 
Pittsburgh Press of December 2. 
Only 766 fans watched the Oak
land intramural championship and 
it seemed like the 66 were root
ing for Pittin its Field House 
yet.
Tech has a first-rate basketball 
team this year that will win most 
of its games. The fans will sup
port the team at away games as 
well as at home. Can the team 
expect similar support from the 
cheerleaders when not one of the 
cheerleaders bothers to go to the 
Pitt Field House for the game?

We are concerned about the 
course of our governments policy 
in Vietnam: the increased bomb
ing of the North and South, the 
killing of American GIs and the 
Vietnamese people, the apparent 
rejection of Hanoi's feeler for ne
gotiations last fall, the almost uni
lateral prosecution of the war by
the executive branch of govern
ment when the power to wage 
war is constitutionally vested in 
Congress. We voiced these con
cerns at the March on Washington 
last Saturday  a protest against 
current American policy  and 
returned to Carnegie Tech seeking 
ways to initiate public discussion 
of our governments actions in 
Vietnam.
While many of the marchers 
were students, it seems likely that 
these students represent opinions 
of but a small percentage of the 
student body on most campuses, 
including Carnegie Techs. It is 
not clear either, however, that 
most students favor the American 
position in Vietnam; rather it 
seems that most do not care and 
do not know very much. It is our 
belief that concern springs from 
knowledge and that understanding 
emerges from free and open de
bate, Consequently we are plan
ning a Carnegie Tech debate in 
Vietnam, just before Christmas 
vacation. Persons interested in 
participating on either side of the 
debate are urged to contact us 
immediately.

If it takes killing to get the Negro out of the white man's streets 
and to protect our constitutional rights, I say, yes, kill them." This 
quote was taken from the Clarion Ledger, Mississippi's largest newsj 
paper. It is a quote from the highly respected Rev. Lynly, a man whoj 
many feel speaks God's word. Within hours after this sermon on July 
17th, Mr. Brewster, a Negro man, was shot by a white man who has! 
attended his service. Is this really Gods way? Many southern whites 
would say it is.
A Negro boy from La Flore County now lies in a hospital completely 
paralyzed. He will remain paralyzed for the rest of his life. This boy 
was sentenced to 90 days in the county farm for stealing a pen knife. 
When a trustee instructed him to pick up a rag, he hesitated for he 
felt he would be beaten if he bent down. The trustee shot him. He is 
fourteen.
The list could run on and on. These two instances occurred a short 
while ago and will never make the news. When a Negro man is beaten 
up or killed, it is not newsworthy as it is so commonplace. Last 
summer, over 20 Negroes were killed due to their involvement in 
civil rights. Only one, James Chaney, will be remembered today, be
cause two whites died with him. It is this lack of concern for a humans 
life that is evident all over Mississippi. Today, I believe it is evident 
all over America, but in more subtle forms.
When I was in Newton there were two people arrested because of 
their involvement in civil rights. ITie first manwas arrested for speed
ing when he was going five miles under the speed limit. The second 
man, also a Negro, was arrested for driving with improper lights. He 
was on his way home after a Freedom Rally. No fine or bail was set 
and he was required to stay in jail overnight where he was severely 
mistreated.
As I got to know more people in the community, I noticed things 
that were very strange and different to me. One cannot really appre
ciate or understand these differences unless he is actually confronted 
with them. Hence, they become reality. One such difference was that 
there were very few Negro men between the ages of 25 and 45. As I 
went from house to house (Iuse the term house loosely as they are much 
different from the houses we are accustomed to) I was confronted 
mainly by three generations of women. I rarely saw men.
The Negro man is often pressured by guilt feelings and his inabi
lity to support his family. His guilt feelings or feelings of inferiority 
are compounded by his domestic wife's attaining of white sophisti
cation." Thus he is driven off much sooner. As a white person, I found 
the Negros fear of the white man still hard to conceive.

Guide Lists 
Summer Jobs
More than 50,000 summer em
ployment openings in this country 
and abroad are listed in the 1966 
Summer Employment Guide just 
published by the National Employ
ment Services Institute, (NESI), 
Washington, D.C.
Finding summer jobs for stu
dents is our year-round job," 
Cortes W. Randall, NESI presi
dent explains; We contact em
ployers and select the kind of jobs 
students want most from those 
available around the world."
The NESI Summer Employment 
Guide lists employments opportu
nities in more than 450 resorts 
in the U.S., in 20 federal govern
ment agencies, and in hundreds of 
private companies. It includes 
complete listings of openings in 37 
foreign countries as well as infor
mation on how to seek particular 
overseas jobs through foreign 
employment agencies, consulates 
and foreign newspapers.
Discussing the student employ
ment situation, Randell notes that 
approximately 10 percent more 
openings will be available for the 
summer of 1966, compared with 
last year, but about 16 per cent 
more students will be looking for 
work. As a result, he adds, employ
ers will again by tightening up re
quirements and demanding more 
experienced help. On the bright
er side, he says salaries are ex
pected to rise 3 to 4 per cent.
The 1966 Summer Employment 
Guides which sells for $2.95, may 
be obtained from B. J. Smith, 
Circulation Manager, National

BTP reached the finals with a 2

Tech Hustles Past W&J 
After Near Miss At Pitt
Techs basketball team broke open a tight game and swamped Washington & 
Jeffersons Presidents 81 to 63 at Tech Gym Saturday before a pleased capacity crowd.
In the opening game of the season last Wednesday, at Fitzgerald Field House 
the Tartans shook off a bad start and rallied in the second half but lost a close 
54-51 decision to the Pitt Panthers.
W&J Smothered in 2nd Half
W & J led the Tartans at halftime, 37-35, after a loosely-play
ed first half in which both teams 
threw away numerous passes. 
In the second half, though, Tech 
froze out the Presidents with a harrassing defense. During one 
stretch of almost ten minutes the 
Prexies could not score a single 
field goal from inside the key.
Meanwhile Ray Morrison be
gan hitting, the Tartans started 
getting wide open for easy layups, 
and Tech steadily pulled away to a 
66-52 lead with 8 minutes left. 
W&J tried to stop the runaway 
with a full-court press, but the clo
sest they could come was eight 
points at 70-62. Then the Tartans 
promptly rattled off seven straight 
points while three W&J starters 
fouled out in the final minutes.
Six-foot-six Jim Brown dom
inated the backboards for Tech and 
sunk 8 out of 9 of his soft, short
jump shots. He led all scores 
with 23 points despite sitting out 
most of the second half with four 
fouls. Mark Lang, a freshman
qcnr)bt ydt mge4nyan vn-D6
vgerg4 BDdrd NW GdD4 Eneg
who has been playing like a threeletter-man, took Brown's place and 
popped in five big field goals.
Photo Finish At Pitt
Wednesday night the heavily - 
favored Pitt Panthers had to go 
down to the last few seconds be
fore escaping with their hides in
tact. Tech trailed 52-48 with 23 
seconds to go when Jeff Kalin scor
ed on a jump shot to make it 52- 
50, but Pitt's Jim Lavalley got 
away on a fast break and dunked 
the ball with both hands to put the 
game out of reach.
A ragged start hurt the Tartans 
again as they committed 13 turn
overs in the first half. Pitt got 
off to a 12-4 lead and led 27 - 
17 at halftime.
Tech, however, dominated play 
in the second half and actually 
outshot the Panthers from the field 
overall, 20 field goals to 16. Pitt 
won at the foul line, hitting 22 of 
24 free throws (Lavalley was 9 for 
9).
The Tartans played the Pan
thers even on rebounds 33 to 33, 
as Lang, rubbing elbows with Pitt's 
big forward line of Lavalley, LovUgW Edeeabd4 -d4reaNirn rd rDn bnneb gen ,eg4 jbrdQaJoK* g4 Rd4 
znnpne J8o* g4 Gnpp zgVa4 JoX*u
ett and Sollens, picked off eleven. 
Most Valuable Player Jeff Kalin 
led the scorers with 13 points and 
had 7 rebounds. Morrison had 
trouble shooting over Larry Szykowny, Pitts fine guard, but join
ed Ray Burdett and Don Keefer 
in an aggressive defensive effort 
that held the Panthers to a cold 
28% shooting percentage.
Tonight Tech plays away at St. 
Vincent, which has lost 95-54 to 
Duquesne and 56-55 to Geneva 
so far. Saturday night the Tartans 
face a stern test at Westminster. 
The Titans have two impressive 
victories - 80 to 55 over Alli
ance and 63 to 55 over Indiana 
State.

Its Tough 
To Be A Coach
Minutes before the big ArmyNavy football game two weeks ago, 
Naval Academy coach Bill Elias 
was interviewed on c a m e r a by 
ABC-TV's Bud Wilkinson. When 
asked how he felt, Elias con
fessed: My anxiety is unmea
surable. It is widespread in scope 
and its massive dimension is limit
less."
Varsity Athletics 
Neglected At Tech
NW Ea-DgnV 9geyd
According to an article in this weeks Sports Il
lustrated, someone asked football coach Joe Gasparella if his job at Tech was in jeopardy after four 
straight losing seasons. Mr. Gasparella said, 1^ 
would like to think that it is. It would show somebody 
is interested. ____________

F1arD J8K*; a4 Ng-yedi4 gen Rd4
vgerg4 sDdrd NW GdD4 Eneg
A lot of students at Carnegie 
Tech are not very interested in 
varsity sports, especially the ma
jor sports of football and basket
ball, and small wonder. In the last 
four years the football team has 
won four games and lost 28, while 
the basketball team has won2land 
lost 63.
The people directly responsible 
for this sad state of affairs  
those on the Administration  have 
shown even less interest. Carnegie 
Tech loses constantly in football 
and basketball because first, it 
does not attract enough compe
tent high school athletes to en
roll and second, because many po
tential players already at Tech 
do not go out for the varsity 
teams.
The second condition is not Ad
ministrations fault, but the stu
dents. There are few men at 
Tech who could come off the in
tramural field and step right into 
a starting position on a varsity 
team, but there are a good num
ber of second and third-string var
sity players who become discour
aged and quit to play intramural 
sports instead of sticking out a 
year or two until they develop 
enough to be of value to the var
sity. But this, like the general 
state of apathy, would change if 
Tartan teams became respectable 
and associated with a feeling of 
pride. (Witness the stir of inte
rest this year when the basket
ball team wins one game and the 
football team just puts up a good 
fight and comes cloie to win
ning.)
And so back to the first point, 
that just not enough good athletes 
come to Carnegie Tech. To get 
enough good football and basketball 
players Tech has to actively re
cruit them, and has to have some
thing to^offer them. Carnegie 
Techs official athletic policy sta
tes that the athletic program is 
to be subordinate to the academic 
program and that Tech is not to 
strive for professionalism or com
mercialism in interscholastic 
sports.
The interpretation of this state
ment over the last few years has 
been that Tech is to exert abso
lutely no extra effort to entice ath
letes to enroll and that the only 
money to be put into the athletic 
program is money for equipment.
Active recruiting does not vio
late the official athletic policy. 
There are plenty of good athle
tes who meet the scholastic re
quirements of Carnegie Tech, and 
no outright payoff has to be of
fered them. Case Tech of Cleve
land, a school very much like 
Carnegie and with an athletic policy 
identical to Carnegie's, has a 55- i 
man football squad. (Carnegie had 
26 football players this year.) 
The Ivy League schools do not of
fer athletic scholarships and have 
strict academic requirements, but 
all recruit extensively and all have 
successful varsity sports.
At Carnegie the only people who 
even talk to prospective athle
tes are football coach Joe Gas
parella (who is also a professor^ 
of architecture) and basketball 
coach Mel Cratsley (who doubles 
as Athletic Director). If either of 
these men invites a high school 
student to Tech and shows him 
around, he has to pay the expen
ses himself.
