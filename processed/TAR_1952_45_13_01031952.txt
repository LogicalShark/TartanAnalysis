Warner Gives Lectures 
To Indian Steel Co.
Dr. J. C. Warner is delivering a 
series of six lectures in India t 
the Tata Iron and Steel Company, 
Ltd., one of the largest steel com
panies in the world.
Dr. and Mrs. Warner left New 
York by plane on Saturday, Dec.
15, and had breakfast in Paris the 
'following morning. From there
* they proceeded to Rome, and then 
to Bombay and Calcutta. On the 
last leg of their journey they flew 
from Calcutta to Jamshedpur, the 
home of the Tata Iron and Steel 
Company.
Alter delivering the lectures 
during the last week of December 
and first week of January, Dr. 
Warner and his wife will travel to
* Bombay and then to London. They 
will return to New York January 
21, 1952.
Dr. Warner is the fourth speaker 
in the Perin Memorial lectures 
series on scientific and allied sub
jects. The series was set up in 
honor of Dr. Charles Page Perin, 
American engineer, who was close
ly associated with Jamshedji Nusserwanji Tata in the establishment 
of the steel industry in India.
For his lectures, Dr. Warner has 
'y chosen the following topics: The 
Iron and Steel Industry in the 
United States, The Revolution in 
Engineering Education in the 
United States, The Corrosion of 
Metals and Alloys, Nitrogen in 
Plain Carbon Steels, Physical 
Chemistry of Liquid SteelOxidation-Reduction Reactions, and 
Reactions of Sulphur in Steelmaking.

upon graduation from college.
For the seniors, the Marine 
Corps offers the officer candidate 
course. Seniors enrolling in the 
program are ordered to active 
duty after graduation and sent 
directly to officer training at 
Quantico, Virginia, for 10 weeks. 
After commissioning, the new of
ficer receives five months of 
specialized officer schooling.
The women officer training class 
is open to all coeds with at least 
sophomore standing. Training for 
this program also consists of two 
summer training sessions of six 
weeks.

SC Election
The new Student Council 
election, declared because of 
the invalidation of the last 
one, will be held February 5. 
Petitions, which can be ob
tained in the Dean of Stu
dents office, are due Janu
ary 16. Petitions from the 
last election will be valid, 
however.
There are the following va
cancies in Council:
6 in E&S
1 in H&SS 
3 in FA 
3 in MMCC
There is also a vacancy in 
Fine Arts for one semester 
only.
The position of assistant 
secretary is open to any junior 
student in MMCC.
Cameron Choir 
Tryouts Planned 
Early In February
Tryouts for both male and fe
male parts in the Cameron Choir 
will be held the first Thursday of 
next semester, February 7, in the 
assembly hall of MMCC at 4:30. 
These tryouts are only for new 
members. Interested students can 
sign up for these tryouts in the 
registration line for the spring 
semester. -
The choir meets twice a week, 
Monday and Thursday for an hour 
rehearsal at 4:30. The Choir, 
which has sung at churches, the 
Veterans Hospital, Chapel services 
and carol sings this past semester, 
plans to have a full schedule in the 
coming months.
December SC Election 
Results Thrown Out
Problems Greet Governing Body
As End Of Term Approaches
Bob Byrne threw a miniature bombshell into the Student Council 
meeting by charging that the SC election of December 11 was illegal 
on no less than six different counts according to the SC constitution 
and by-laws. Council, of course, had no choice but to declare the 
results of the election invalid and*---------------------------------------------------------
to ask Bruce Padolf, election 
committee chairman to make plans 
for another election.
Too Few Candidates 
Specifically, Byrne charged that 
the number of candidates was in
sufficient to fill the actual vacan
cies. A recent amendment to the 
constitution changed the repre
sentation on Council from one for 
every 100 students to one for every 
200 students. However, this 
amendment was not on the books, 
since Dr. Miner had not yet sign
ed it. Therefore, the actual va
cancies were twice those announc
ed by Council. There were also 
various discrepancies in the bal
lots themselves.
Skibo Report 
Wally Neilson, in a preliminary 
report of the Skibo prices inves
tigating committee, declared, 
Students have no legitimate gripe 
on the general level of Skibo 
prices. In their investigation, 
the committee visited various res
taurants and cafeterias in East 
Liberty, Oakland, University of 
Pittsburgh, and Pennsylvania
School Spirit Improvement 
Stems On Football & Freshmen
In an attempt to find out what CIT students think about their 
own school spirit, Bill Smith, printing management junior, recently 
conducted a poll of the students he met in classes and in Skibo. In 
his short questionnaire he asked several questions, the most pointed 
being, How may school spirit ?---------------------------------------------------------
be improved?
Answers to this knotty problem 
were quite divergent in view
point, ranging from a social fee 
system of paying for social-events 
at registration to the simple state
ment of play Pitt. The most 
popular suggestion to jack up the 
dragging spirit was to enforce 
freshman regulations. This idea 
was, of course, fostered mostly by 
upperclassmen.
Football Second 
Football spirit rated second

change. Several suggestions of 
playing in Skibo bowl instead of

A new idea for activitiesminded students has come 
from Germany, where the an
cient sport of duelling is again 
taking the limelight. It is the 
heartfelt desire of the German 
student to acquire the scar of 
honor on his cheek. Fraterni
ties practice the art on the sly 
in order to be able to meet 
possible challenges. Two 
groups have even lost their 
houses due to lack of perseverence in these training ses

radical ones of play Pitt. Bet
ter class organization with more 
participation in class functions 
pulled third place.
Faculty policy, upperclassmen 
attitudes, and commuter indiffer
ence showed up next for improve
ment. The gripe of too little 
publicity appeared on three of 
the poll sheets, although only one 
of the three read the Skibo bul
letin board daily.
Selected Comments 
A few choice answers to the 
question, How may school spirit 
be improved? follow: Enforce 
traditions more and (if possible) 
get some life into the dead-heads, 
!!???, It looks hopeless!, In
crease the alcohol content, 
Have upperclassmen inspire fresh
men by actions, Change those 
silly cheers, Give the students 
something to yell about, and 
De-emphasize school-work.
One of the most philosophical 
was: Try to impress the pleas

certain small things in common) 
as against a campus full of strang
ers or near strangers.
College for Women. They com
pared the prices of specific items 
and discovered that Skibo prices 
were from less to considerably 
less than those of the other eat
ing establishments. Nielson also 
stated that the Skibo administra
tion was willing to release figures 
of their actual expenses if re
quested.
Prices at Minimum
Several conditions prevent the 
lowering of Skibo prices still 
further, Nielson said. In the first 
place, Skibo is entirely self-suf
ficient and receives no funds from 
the school. Inflation, of course, is 
also a factor. Finally, there is 
considerable loss from thievery 
and breakage: 32 dozen salt and 
pepper shakers were lost in a 
school year.
A complete report of the inves
tigation will be published in the 
Tartan at a later date.
Campus Chest Low
Wes Apple reported that 161 
pints of blood were donated in 
the Bloodmobile visit. The quota 
was 174. Eleven people were 
turned down for medical reasons 
and 24 failed to show. However, 
a number who were not scheduled 
donated blood to partially make 
up the difference.
Campus Chest reached 98 per 
cent of its goal, acording to the 
CC chairman, Ad DeVido. Student 
contributions, however, were low. 
A fuller report will be given at 
the next meeting.

People in Glass Houses
Student Councils recent election fiasco couldnt have 
come at a worse time for the student solons. With their heads 
still filled with noble thoughts on the efficient reorganiza
tion of some aspects of student organizations, they suddenly 
find that their own electiona relatively simple thinghas 
been so mismanaged that it must be voided.
But while Student Council itselfand Elections Chair
man Bruce Padolf in particularmust take the responsibili
ty for an easy task poorly done, there were others who con
tributed to the general confusion.
APO, usually a paragon of scrupulous attention to detail, 
neglected to print Hare system voting instructions on the bal
lots and thus made the election procedure illegal. But a far 
more important factor was the failure of the Director of Student 
Personnel and Welfare to sign, or, in fact, to do anything about, 
the measure changing the representation ratio on Council.
Since changing representation on Council from 1/100 
to 1/200 is a change in the constitution, it requires the ap
proval of the Executive Board. In the past this procedure 
on amendments has been a matter of formalityor so Coun
cil was led to believe-^-and therefore the election was plan
ned on the assumption that the measure would be approved 
and signed, and that representation could be reduced as the 
amendment provides.
But even though there was almost a week lag between 
the time the measure was taKen to Administration Hall 
and the election itself, the amendment was not signed nor 
was it returned to Council. Thus, with the amendment not 
approved, representation could not legally be reduced and 
the results of the election could not fill the vacancies soon 
to appear. So on this count also the election had to be thrown 
out.
But the fact remains that it was the responsibility of 
the Elections Chairman to check these details, as well as 
others. Council had better concentrate on improving the 
efficiency of its own organization before it goes crusading 
elsewhere for better student organizations.
Have They 
Let Us Down?
Place in the Sun
Three thousand people dont make much of a dent in 
the broad expanse of Forbes Field.
More than a few people of late have made this astute 
observation and have gone on to ask the old question: Why 
not play Carnegies games on the Carnegie campus? The 
Tech bowl, if properly renovated, should provide ample 
room for the usual home crowd.
There seems little doubt that such a move would in
crease student interest and enjoyment of football and the 
campus. Biggest headache, for this project would be money, 
space, and future expectations. The high cost of building and 
renovation plus natures natural limitations on the size of 
the bowl cannot be passed off lightly.
New mens dorms, a central library, and an improved 
student cafeteria-union at present seem more important than 
a Tech Bowl. But long range plans for the future certainly 
should make provision for the possibility of bringing foot
ball back to the campus.

FIRST THINGS FIRST
A New Years Thought
By Deek di Salvo
Knowing that discontentment with life is the lot of most of us 
at some time; realizing that despair and an overwhelming sense of 
futility go hand in hand with the creative act of birth itself, I 
should like to turn these few lines into the shape of a horn of plenty. 
It would be my deepest hope that*-
some memory of these words 
might invade a moment of your 
despair, your insecurity and your 
doubt. It would be my deepest 
joy that some memory of these 
words might share your joy, your 
hope, and your high moment of 
happiness. At this, the resurrec
tion of a new year from the dying 
of the old, the feeble words at my 
command would lift themselves to 
sing praises to the abundancies of 
living.
In the midst of narrow streets 
my words would glorify the wide
ness of the fields, the plains and 
the seas. Among the skeletons of 
steel and high bodies of white 
stone my words would praise the 
eyes that can behold mountains 
crowned with snow and hills rolled 
over by the weight of pine and 
maple and birch trees. When the 
fumes and smogs of belching 
smoke stacks crowd out the air, 
my lungs would breathe content 
for they have known the sweet 
winds running with the spring. 
When the yieldings of the grape 
and the grain are barren to my 
taste, I shall be rich with water 
from the deep earth. If the wood 
upon my table is naked of fine 
foods, then I shall eat with joy the 
raiment of the trees and bless the 
miracle of bread. If my mind is 
overcome by noises of the city, I 
shall find peace in memory of the 
music of the crickets and night 
birds in moon light forests. If I 
am bowed with toiling, can I but 
praise the wondrousness of sleep? 
If I am broken with heartache, can 
I not but rejoice for I have known 
love? If all the daily cares of liv
ing weigh me down, I need but 
raise my head and see the sun, the 
moon, and stars. If I am cold, 
cannot I not find gladness in the 
warmth of one friend? If earth 
would bind my hands with help
lessness, I am not imprisoned with 
my soul? If I reach the bounds of 
all knowledge, I yet can hunger 
after eternity.
When I know pain, I know the 
promise of its absence and peace 
of its subsidence. When I know 
loneliness, then I can listen for 
the whisperings of God. When I 
am sore with deep frustration, I
can find sweet oils of prayer and 
wrap my longings in soft patience. 
When my mind denies, I need but 
lift my heart up to the hills; to 
the heavens; to the limit of im
agination and find new affirma
tion. When I see no plan or pur
pose, I need only turn my mind 
upon itself; to contemplate the 
vastness and minuteness of all be
ing, and then there is possibility 
and hope. I can bless all my bar
ren hours with the joy of one mo
ment of fulfillment.
If I am failed by earth, I have 
recouse to Him who knows no 
failure. If I fail myself, I have 
recourse to Him who knows only 
to forgive. Thus I rejoicewith 
birthwith lifewith deathfor 
being for its own sake as my rea
son.
Harvard English Prof 
Blasts American Girls
1r?
Have College Women Let Us 
Down? is a question that Howard 
Mumford Jones answers with an 
indictment in the January issue 
of Mademoiselle.
Mr. Jones, Harvard English 
professer and president of the 
American Academy of Arts and 
Sciences, finds a withering away 
of the sense of intellectual adven 
ture, of individual inquiry among 
American college women. No 
longer is the campus a bastion of 
causes and movements. Instead, 
the prevalent belief is that securi
ty is the end-all of existence.
Security An Obsession 
In a nation in which security 
has become an obsession, Mr. 
Jones says, the result is, natural
ly enough, that kind of genteel 
self-absorption, that waning of 
civic spirit characteristic of the 
present generation of young 
American girls in college. Nor 
has this girl the foggiest suspi
cion of the truth that to maintain 
the security she takes for granted, 
she may have to do something 
more about it than she does.
She wants a job but not a ca
reer. She wants a white-collar 
husband, but also a ranch house, , 
interesting neighbors, and an in
come of $10,000 a year ten years 
after college. She gets her les
sons without applying her mind. 
She is not one whit interested ki 
the world around her: in modem 
art, literature, music or philoso
phy.
World in Teetering
A dark unreasoning fear has 
her in its grip. This is her fear 
of the futuredominated by the)| 
atom bomb, Jones says. She is 
pessimistic and confused, but she 
is unwilling to act. The world, 
for the college girl, is teetering 
on the brink 'of change, it is going 
to teeter there for the next few 
decades, and thats that.
Mr. Jones admits that the col
lege womans inharmonious ele
ments are an echo of her confused 
society, but he is not prepared to 
accept the fact that college stu-1 
dents are entitled merely to echo 
society. He feels that the only 
way the individual girl can clear

Campus Interviews on Cigarette Tests
No. 31...THE MOUNTAIN GOAT
n e thought they were trying to make him the butt-end 
of a joke when he was asked to judge cigarette mildness 
with a mere puff of one brand and a quick sniff of 
another. The fancy foot-work didnt dazzle him! He 
knew that the pinnacle of pleasure comes from steady 
smoking ... and that there is only one test that gives you 
enough time to permit conclusive proof. Smokers 
throughout America have made the same decision!
Its the sensible test... the 30-Day Camel Mildness 
Test, which simply asks you to try Camels on a 
day-after-day, pack-after-pack basis. No snap judgments! 
Once youve tried Camels for 30 days in your T-Zone

Scotch n Soda Problems Fall

Now Jeanne is looking for peo

the success of the showin the past 
to the hard work of everyone con

Basketeers Hit Slump; 
Drop Three Straight
Upset Betliany; Lose To Gettysburg
Westminster, And Slippery Rock
By a narrow margin of two points the Tartan netters added a 
third game to their losing streak last Saturday evening as Slippery 
Rock edged the Skibos 57-55 in a hard fought game which was 
decided only as the whistle blew.
The Slippery Rock Rockets ?--------------------------------------------------------
jumped off to an early 10 point 23- 
13 lead in the first quarter, but
the determined Tartans explod
ed in the second quarter to nar
row the margin to 24-23 at half 
time. The remainder of the game 
saw the lead change hands on 
practically every shot with the 
final minutes narrowing to a duel 
between Tom Beck of Carnegie 
and Tom Beck of Slippery Rock.
Tech Blows Lead 
On December 19 the netters lost 
another heart-breaking game to 
the Westminster Titans as the 
final score showed the Titans, 66, 
Tartans, 65. Although the score 
ended with Westminster on the 
long end, it was the Tartans who 
led the scoring until the final sec
onds of play.
With 10 seconds remaining in 
the game the Taitans held a three 
point margin; then big Ed Halas 
got his hands on the ball and suc
cessfully added four points to the 
Titan score before the Tartans 
could recover.
Battle of Gettysburg:
In the game that began their 
losing streak, the Tartans lost on 
December 15 to Gettysburg. The 
Bullets maintained their undefeat
ed status by gaining a nine point 
first quarter advantage and hold
ing it right down to the finish for 
a 67-58 victory at the Skibo Gym.
Deciding factors in the game 
seemed to be the success of Get
tysburg at the free throw line and 
the inability of the Tartans to con
nect on their set shots. The Bul
lets caked 25 out of 33 charity 
tosses against 18 out of 26 for the 
Plaid.
Carnegie badly missed the valu
able services of Hilary Holste as 
he was banished from the game 
on five personal fouls within a 
minute of the start of the second 
half.
High scoring honors of the eve
ning went to Kuenzig who has 
been consistently playing better 
ball for the Tartans. Kuenzig had 
a total of 20 points; Bill Farbacher 
second with 11.
Outstanding Win 
The Skibos turned in their most 
outstanding performance of the 
season in defeating the Bethany 
Bisons 79-71. The 79 points tied 
the all-time Tartan scoring record 
which was set two seasons ago 
against Steubenville.
In the see-saw battle the Tar
tans were not insured of a victory 
until the last few seconds of the 
game. Trailing only 33-32 at the 
halftime Bethany, however, could 
not quite match the pace that the 
Skibos set for the remainder of 
the game. Tom Craig led the scor
ing attack with 22 points, but his 
rebounding as he consistently 
cleared the boards was almost as 
vaulable as his points.
Overend Honored
Buddy Overend, Carnegies 
Director of Atheltics, will be 
guest of honor February 3 
when the Pittsburgh Chapter 
of the Baseball Writers Asso
ciation holds its 19th annual 
sports roundup at the William

Baker To Be Back As Coach; 
Signs Three-Year Contract
It was good news for Carnegie football fans Sunday as it was

Carnegies improved mermen received a surpise in their second

On the Carnegie side both stu

with Bakers decision. Buddy

The 39 teams entered in play 
this year represent only 27 dif

number of entries with four teams 
as representatives. The teams have 
been split as usual into fou*i 
leagues.

freshman Bob Coulter teamed 
with Bill Aiken and Tom Astle for 
the win. Grove City showed its 
strength as it took first and sec
ond in the 200 yard freestyle and 
the Skibos were in for a battle.
Firsts But No Win
The Tartans scored more firsts 
than Grove City as they captured 
five to four. The Grovers, how
ever, racked up more show and 
place positions as they nabbed the 
win.
The Tartans had the only dou
ble winner of the day in Nick 
Demas who took the 50 and 100 
yard free style events. Bob Wad
dell won another first for Carnegie 
in the individual Medley while 
Bob Coulter turned in the Plaids 
other win in the 200 yard back
stroke.
The Tartans defeat was made 
easier by the fine showing of 
freshmen Bob Coulter and Bill 
Aiken who promise to do much 
for the team in the future.
The mermen were hampered 
partly by the absence of Dick 
Kramer, ace distance freestyler, 
who was in flight training in Ak
ron at the time of the meet.
The Tartan tankers will next 
meet Allegheny in the Skibo pool 
at 2:00 p.m., Saturday, January 12.

Among the undergraduates on any college campus, youll find 
the talk reaching up to the clouds. And once in a while  in a class
room, around a study table, or even in a bull session  a really big 
idea is born. x
Big ideas come, too, from the men and women in laboratories, 
business offices, shops. But often these professionals are exploring 
a path first glimpsed in college.
How do we know? Because of the many college people who 
have come into the Bell System, where big ideas and a lot of dreams 
have taken their place in progress. The human voice, carried along 
a wire, first across a town, then a state, a nation, and now the world. 
Music and pictures and things happening delivered into cities and 
hamlets all across the land by radio ai.i television networks.
Were always looking for the men and women who get big 
ideas  whether theyre about people, or machines, or ways of doing 
things. Its the only way the Bell System can keep on giving this 
country the best telephone service in the world.

TOoRoT HeFFoL
With 1952 ushering in another year for Carnegie ath
letics, the sports staff of the Tartan can only wish it brings 
as much success to the Skibo sports scene as the year just 
gone by. A final glance at Carnegies sports record for 1951 
reveals it was a good year for the Plaid, with six of the 
seven varsity teams turning in winning seasons. 1951 saw 
undefeated seasons in track and cross country, the TriState championship in cross country, and the Penn-Ohio 
championship in swimming all come Carnegies way. At the 
same time the football eleven kept on its winning way with 
a 6-2 record, the golf team won 4, lost 2, and tied 1, while
the tennis team was marking up a 9 and 2 slate for one
of its finest seasons.
Nomination for outstanding Carnegie coach in 1951 goes to
Guy T. Halferty with Dr. Eddie Baker running a close second.
Guiding both track and cross country teams to their first un
blemished seasons in recent years, and capping the harrier record 
with the Tri-State championship, Halferty brought the two socalled minor sports into the athletic limelight in 1951. Dr. 
Baker, in his third successful year with the rejuvenated football 
team, completed a 6-2 season with a squad not picked to win 
more than half its games.
In other highlights of 1951, grid wins over Akron and 
Case and the basketball victory over Pitt rated as the top 
spectator event of the year. The Akron game, in which the 
lead changed hands six times before the Tartan gridders 
ground out a 42-32 triumph, was tops in the thrill and chill 
department, while favored Pitts hardwood defeat was ahead 
in the best earned section. In top individual performances 
of 51, Connie Hamman set a 15.3 Carnegie record in the 
high hurdles and Johnny Luchok a 9.8 record in the 100 
yard dash for the track team. On the gridiron Quent Holtz, 
Clyde Stahle, Fritz Wilson and John Luchok turned in fine 
efforts, while Bob Carman and John Cooper were running 
down the opposition in cross' country. In swimming, Grey 
Duncan and Nick Demas again led Coach Claude Sofields 
tearyi, while Bob Weiderhorn was holding the tennis fort. 
In basketball, the top action was by Len Bianchi, Bill Farbacher, and Tom Craig, who also doubled in football.
Baker Stays
Although most Carnegie football fans and especially the 
players would have felt a loss if Dr. Eddie Baker had ac
cepted the Pitt coaching job, it is easy to understand why 
Baker was interested in the job. His Alma Mater, Pitt was 
the scene of some heroic feats by Baker in his collegiate 
pigskin career. In thumbing through some old Pittsburgh 
papers, mention was found of one of his deeds in an issue 
dated October 12, 1930. It seems that Baker in aiding Pitt 
defeat Western Reserve 52-0 had run the opening kickoff 
back 97 yards for a touchdown, scored two more touch
downs in the first half, and then adjourned to the sidelines 
to watch his teammates complete the massacre.
In the same issue was a headlinebigger than the one given 
Pitt and on the top of the pageannouncing that Carnegie Tech 
 had just extracted the stingers from Georgia Techs Jackets 
by the painless and easy method of 31-0. Later in the same 
year in the annual clash between the Tartans and Panthers, 
Pitt came out on top in the battle between two giants by a 
narrow 7-6 score. In the same season, however, the Tartans set 
a scoring record of 275 points for a season, a mark which still 
stands unbroken by Tartan teams.

Students Return Home; 
Skibo Thrives Again
By Dick Durstine
Any alert observer has no doubt noticed recently a vast influx 
of students into our beloved institution. The apparent reason for this 
mass migration is the conclusion of the Christmas recess, which be
gan at a time when most inmates here were about to consider trans
ference to Pitt (a nearby liberal#-----------------------------------------------------
art college).
But now the bulk of students 
have returned, bright eyed and i'efreshed (hah), and the new year 
beginneth. It would be impossi
ble in the limited space available 
to discuss the traits of each and 
every one of the 27 odd hundred 
(or 27 hundred odd, if you prefer) 
students as they return to CIT 
after two weeks of vacation. If 
this were attempted, someone 
would undoubtly be left out. and 
hurt feelings would ensue.
The True Student 
Therefore, we shall revert to 
that great American institution, 
the type, which groups individuals 
together into bunches, like peanuts 
in a peanut cluster, thus making 
people easier to talk about and 
generalize trnon.
First, let us consider the true 
student, a rare type, but none
theless one which exists in limit
ed numbers, particularly in the 
graduate school. This type has 
never left at all, but remained on 
campus to write a thesis, or per
haps to translate the Upanishads 
into Runic.
The Pseudo-Student 
Next on our list is the pseudo
student, who heads home with a 
car laden with books, papers, slide 
rules, and other equipment, with 
the professed intention of slaving 
all vacation on schoolwork. This 
is obviously a ruse, and the only 
reason this scholarly load might 
be removed from the back seat at 
all is to clear that area for other 
action. But by now this individual 
is back at his post at the Greeks, 
and the world goes on as usual.
Also back on duty is the three 
armed bridge sloth (one for his 
cards, one for his coffee, and one 
for his girl). This specimen may 
be seen in Skibo any afternoon, 
with no apparent change due to 
the recent two-week leave.
The Skirted Student
At scenic Morewood gardens, 
the girls have returned, each bear
ing suitcases, boxes, bags, and 
loose shoes by the ton, in exactly 
the same manner in which they 
departed. There is some doubt 
in the minds of informed observ
ers as to whether more than five 
percent of this stuff is ever un
packed, but no reliable poll has 
ever been taken on the subject 
(another potential job for APO).
And finally, much to the dis
tress of the student body, the fac
ulty has returned also, with new 
ideas as to books to read, papers 
to write, and what to do in the 
hours between midnight and 8:00 
a.m. But a study of faculty types

up her confusions is to work at 
the clearance problem, which 
neither priest nor professor nor 
parent nor psychologist can do for 
her.
Write Reactions
I suppose this mood will pass, 
Professor Jones says. Neither 
the nation nor the colleges can 
UVe indefinitely in negativism ... 
Quite possibly the listlessness now 
evident among college girls in 
America may be scattered over
night by some dramatic turn in 
history. Meanwhile the colleges 
are playing it safe, and so are the 
girls.

Appointed To Neiv 
Koppers Chair
Dr. Robert W. Carlin of the Car
negie Tech Chemistry department 
holds the first 
Becker ^Profesager of Koppers

construction division.
The professorship is in recogni
tion of his many contributions to

Thus Skibo again has patrons, 
students again have worries, and 
were all back in the harness, with 
the exception of the President, 
who will doubtless arrive in time 
for finals._____________________________________V

Phi Gamma Pi Treats 
Institute Children
On Sunday, December 9, the Phi 
Gamma Pi Sorority held its annual 
Christmas party at the Carnegie 
Union irom 2:00 to 4:30 p.m. This 
party, unlike other parties, was not 
held solely for the organizations 
membership, but for the benefit 
and enjoyment of approximately 
fifty children from the Holy Fam
ily Institute. Entertainment for 
the affaira puppet showwas 
presented by six children from the 
Ridgewood School in West View. 
During the pauses between acts of 
the show, the sextet sang some 
carols.
After the conclusion of the pro
gram, all children attending re
ceived a gift and then adjourned
to the dining room where ice 
cream, cookies, and cocoa were 
served.
The afternoon was rounded off 
with the singing of Christmas Car
ols by the entire group present, 
and the opening of gifts by the 
guests of the sorority.
Chairladies of the program and 
refreshment committees for the 
affair were Marjorie Reed and 
Vera Cosentino respectively.
So much for last year.
Looking ahead, 1952 finds the 
Phi Gamma Pis holding a Mother
