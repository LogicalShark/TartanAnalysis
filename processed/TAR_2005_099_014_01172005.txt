Campus activities raise funds, awareness of tsunami relief-rebuilding efforts
by Brittany McCandless
Assistant News Editor
Amidst international response 
to the South Asian earthquake 
and tsunami, Carnegie Mellon 
University is taking its own initia
tive to provide relief for the vic
tims of the natural disaster.
We have a significant number 
of students who are from these 
affected areas, and there needs 
to be some kind of call to action, 
said M. Shernell Smith, service 
initiatives coordinator of Student 
Development and housefellow 
for New House. There was no 
way in which we would have al
lowed classes to start on Monday 
without something happening on 
campus. Thats just how it is.
Starting last Monday and run
ning through the Martin Luther 
King Day celebration today, 
various individuals and organi
zations have set up a table in 
the University Center to collect 
monetary donations for relief 
and rebuilding efforts. The pro
ceeds from the tabling efforts 
will be donated to the Brothers 
Brother Foundation (BBF), a 
47-year-old Pittsburgh-based in
ternational charity. According
to Karen Dempsey, Director of 
Development for BBF, the organi
zation has already provided over 
$8 million in pharmaceuticals, 
medical equipment and books to 
the tsunami victims.
Smith said that Student 
Development initiated the UC 
tabling effort as a way to raise 
awareness in a short length of 
time.
I knew as soon as the letter 
went out from the President stat
ing that we were doing tabling 
that I wasnt concerned about 
who was going to run the tables 
by the end of the week. I knew 
what type of students we have 
here on our campus and the type 
of student organizations that we 
have and that service is a part of 
their mission, said Smith, who 
has received a flood of e-mails in 
response to the request for volun
teers at the table.
Im elated with the responses 
that Ive gotten back from in
dividuals and organizations on 
campus. Hopefully theyll follow 
through with that.
Last Thursday representa
tives from the Pittsburgh Sri 
Venkateswara Temple, Carnegie 
Mellon graduate student organi
zation AID India, and BBF facili
tated a panel discussion to reflect 
upon the impact of the tsunami 
and to discuss long-term campus 
relief activities.
During the discussion, panel
ists advised anyone interested in 
helping out with the relief effort 
to stick to well-known organi
zations. While the tsunami has 
ruined much of the infrastructure 
of the affected areas, Dempsey 
assured audience members that 
these organizations, such as the 
BBF, use air shipments to ensure 
their donations reach the vic
tims.
Panelists also stressed continu
ing the relief effort on a long
term basis. Rebuilding efforts 
will take five, even ten years, 
said Prabhu Ram Raghunumurr 
from the Sri Venkateswara 
Temple. Raghunumurr suggested 
that people interested in helping 
narrow their focus in order to see 
the greatest impact.
Pick a village or a school in 
one of the affected countries and 
focus your donations and mobili
zation of supplies and volunteers 
there.
Its almost already yesterdays 
news, said Sajid M. Siddiqi, a
See TSUNAMI, page A3
Genevieve Cook from the Office of International Education tables in the University Center last week as part of the 
Carnegie Mellon relief-rebuild effort for the tsunami victims. Numerous individuals and campus organizations 
manned the table to collect donations in the first of many planned events to raise awareness and funds for the 
rebuilding effort.
Wreck in West Wing
A plumbing leak in a second floor West Wing dorm last Monday caused structural damage to much of the 
rooms beneath. The ceilings of both the West Wing cluster and the adjacent mens bathroom partially col
lapsed as a result of the seepage, and a great deal of the cluster computer equipment was damaged.
City fiscal crisis results in raised job tax
by Louisa Kinoshi
Staffwriter
Student workers returning to 
part-time work this year face a 
five fold increase in an annual 
occupational tax. The new 
occupational tax, now renamed 
the Emergency and Municipal 
Services (EMS), has increased 
by $42 from the former annual 
$10 occupational privilege 
tax imposed on all workers in 
Pittsburgh.
The city councils resolution 
was no surprise considering the 
recent financial turmoil the city 
of Pittsburgh has been facing. 
The EMS tax is one of the recent 
steps the city has been taking 
to rectify its financial problems. 
Last November, Carnegie Mellon 
students were affected by a pro
posed PAT cutback which would 
have ended all weekend Port 
Authority bus service, as well 
as weekday transportation after 
9 pm. The city has also had to 
decrease spending in education, 
the fire department, the police
department, and road mainte
nance.
Pittsburgh has to find other 
ways besides taxes. The city is 
known for its railroad system and 
tourism. I dont like the tax but 
maybe its for something good, 
said Jonathan Perry, a sopho
more psychology major. Diane 
Ghogomil, a high school senior 
at Allderdice High School who 
works at the information desk, 
is more sympathetic towards the 
tax. I understand being from 
Pittsburgh and seeing the dis
tress. I am not bitter about it.
The EMS tax was originally 
billed as a dollar-a-week tax, in 
order to help cities pay for police 
and fire protection, road main
tenance and property tax relief. 
The city councils $417.5 million 
budget for 2005 does not include 
city money budgeted for street 
repairs and capital improve
ments.
Effective January 1, 2005, all 
Carnegie Mellon employees will 
incur a $52 deduction from their 
first paycheck in January of each 
calendar year, or from their first
paycheck if hired later in the 
year. Those who do not make 
up to $52 in their first paycheck 
will receive zero net pay and the 
balance will be withheld in sub
sequent paychecks.
Colleen Bendl, director of 
Payroll Services, explains why 
the university chose to collect 
the entire $52 from the first 
paycheck instead of dividing it 
among two paychecks of $26 
each. Payroll Services chose 
to deduct $52 because of the 
pay frequency of monthly versus 
biweekly pay installments. The 
tax resolution was just finalized 
and we did not have much of a 
chance to make changes to our 
system. We will be looking at it 
this year.
Most student workers fall into 
the lower income bracket, which 
is defined as those workers mak
ing under $12,000 a year, and 
can file for a $42 return at the 
end of the year. To file a claim, 
a worker must file an EM-1 form 
with the city and provide a fedSee TAX, page A3
Students applaud Summit program
by Isabel Gardocki
Staffwriter
From January 6 to 8, Carnegie 
Mellon hosted its first annual 
Summit  three days of classes, 
seminars and workshops for stu
dents. Course topics hit across 
the spectrum, including God as 
CEO, Snowshoeing, and How 
to Be a Player: Relationship Tips 
from a Master. The instructors 
were a mix of faculty, profession
als, and students who came for
ward to share their hobbies or 
interests.
I feel like I learned a lot, said 
first-year CIT student Martha 
Ryan when asked how she felt 
about the Summit program. Ryan 
was among the 150 students who 
participated in Summit before 
the official start of University
courses.
Summit gave us the op
portunity to try something we 
wouldve never tried before, said 
senior chemistry major Christine 
DeForest.
This type of attitude was ex
actly what Roger Ma, a fifth-year 
senior with a degree in business 
administration and economics, 
had in mind when he created the 
Summit program. Inspired two 
years ago by a friend who wanted 
to take a woodshop class that did 
not fit into his schedule, Ma de
cided to create a program where 
you could take courses such as 
Acting for Non-Majors without 
being stuck as number 35 on the 
waiting list. He also wanted to 
encourage students from differ
ent colleges to interact. A lot of 
the time, you meet great people 
at Orientation, but end up never
seeing them again because they 
arent in your college or major, 
said Ma. Both MIT and Johns 
Hopkins University have imple
mented similar programs.
CMUs Summit program has 
received a positive reaction 
from students who attended. I 
made so many new friends, said 
first-year music major Aubrey 
OConnor. The atmosphere was 
comfortable and the interactive 
classes made it easy to approach 
people and start conversations. 
MCS first-year Gorana Smailagic 
agreed. My expectations were 
more than met at the Salsa 
Dancing class. I learned a lot and 
had a blast. I want to dance and 
learn a lot more salsa now, said 
Smailagic.
Classes were typically between

Israeli Consul leads Hillel discussion
Uriel Palti, the Israeli Consul General to Philadelphia, and Oded Frid, the Isreal Fellow for Hillel Jewish University 
Center, speak during a student discussion at Hillel on Friday. Palti spoke on the Israeli political climate.
campuses, and [he] wanted to 
start at the top. 
Roughly 30 people were invited 
to the discussion, which took 
place at the Edward and Rose 
Berman Hillel Jewish University 
Center in Oakland. The audience 
consisted primarily of students 
from Carnegie Mellon University 
and University of Pittsburgh. 
After some preliminary comments 
from Weill and Oded Frid, Hillels 
Israel Fellow, Palti began his talk 
by declaring how refreshing 
it was to see a young audience. 
I meet people all the time who 
think they are very important, 
but never young, he said.
Palti, who was recently named 
the Israeli Consul General to 
Philadelphia, previously worked 
at the Israeli consulates in New
York and Los Angeles. He also rep
resented Israel on the UN General 
Assemblys Legal Committee and 
was instrumental in the peace 
talks and treaty between Israel 
and Jordan. Currently, the Israeli 
consulate in Philadelphia serves 
the Mid-Atlantic region, includ
ing Pennsylvania, Ohio, West 
Virginia, Kentucky, Delaware, 
and southern New Jersey.
Paltis talk focused mainly on 
the present and future politi
cal situations in Israel, particu
larly in light of the election of 
Mahmoud Abbas as the neW 
Palestinian president. We are at 
a very important juncture, he 
declared. He expressed optimism 
over Abbas election, saying, We

Last Friday, the Hillel Jewish 
University Center hosted Uriel 
Palti, the Israeli Consul General 
to Philadelphia, for a discussion 
and breakfast. The event was also 
hosted by the Pittsburgh Israel 
Public Affairs Committee and the 
Carnegie Mellon Israel Public 
Affairs Committee.
He [Palti] approached us 
with the idea [of visiting], said 
Aaron Weill, the executive direc
tor of Hillel. He wanted to visit 
Pittsburgh as it is an important 
Jewish community, and the idea 
to visit our campus was that he 
heard about the volume of Israeloriented activities on Pittsburgh

Our community suffers from a 
case of apathy toward issues that 
deserve a great deal of attention.
The explosive, fiery debate ignited 
by the 2004 Natrat taught this com
munity a lot about itself. But the fire 
has died. Our campus has returned 
to its aloof status quo: an environ
ment bereft of debate among most 
students. In such an atmosphere, un
derlying problems will not change, 
and it is inevitable that some event 
in the future will cause another wild
fire of anger and disgust.
In the January 10 special edi
tion of The Tartan, which featured 
our organizations letter of intent 
to the community, the report of the 
Presidential Commission on The 
Natrat, and commentary from both 
administrators and members of The 
Tartans editorial staff, we reaf
firmed our commitment to providing 
a valuable newspaper that will spur 
constructive discussion.
The Tartan received very little 
feedback on our special issue. 
Should we interpret silence to mean 
that everyone agrees? Im certain 
that we should not. Just as many 
news sources are criticized for un
derreporting the good in the world, 
we often receive feedback only when 
things go wrong.
But I am afraid this silence is a 
symptom of yet another problem: 
Inclusive discourse is difficult to 
achieve in the face of overbearing 
but unsupported diversity rhetoric.
A study of the influences on col
lege students openness to diversity 
quotes a student who spoke up at a 
public forum: I dont want to go to 
a diverse university. If you want to 
go to a diverse university, then apply 
to one. Why ruin it for people here? 
The student later claimed that other 
people at the meeting felt the same 
way, but avoided involvement be
cause of the stigma attached to dis
sent on the subject; they excluded 
themselves from engaging in the dis
cussion, and their beliefs remained 
unchanged.
We know that there are people 
who do not want a diverse and ac
cepting campus, and it is up to those 
who do to prove that there is a better 
way. But if the accepted framework 
for discussion is too rigid and is not 
backed by efforts to include every
one, the students whose opinions 
fall outside the boundaries will dis
engage and become further isolated; 
progress will be impossible. To cre
ate an environment that will achieve 
real progress, there must always be a 
fire burning.
I am dedicated to fostering an 
environment of pluralism at The 
Tartan; we have learned the lesson 
well  the hard way. We want to 
reach out to the community for new 
contributors, for thoughtful indi
viduals with a different perspective. 
The result should be a newspaper 
with a rich Pillbox, broader coverage 
in News, and a robust and provoca
tive Forum.
We are beginning an active drive 
for recruitment, and many profes
sors have invited us to visit their 
classes to tell their students about 
the opportunities offered within The 
Tartan. We will be in contact with 
student organizations, working to 
reach a broad cross-section of the 
population. My thanks go to the pro
fessors who have been welcoming to 
The Tartan, and I hope that people 
we approach in the future will be 
equally helpful.
The staff of The Tartan is excited 
and proud to publish the first issue 
of the new year, which promises to 
be marked by great improvement. 
Unfortunately, we are without sports 
writers, so we are unable to run a 
full Sports section. Our sports editor, 
Christian DAndrea, is enthusiastic 
and encourages new writers to ap
proach him. All the members of the 
editorial staff, new and old, have 
engrossed themselves in their work 
and are eager to develop the content 
and form of The Tartan. On behalf of 
the entire staff, I thank you for your 
contributed support and readership.

Today we celebrate Dr. Martin Luther 
King Jr., one of Americas greatest lead
ers. Unlike many institutions, Carnegie 
Mellon University does not give students 
a full day off. Instead, classes are held 
in the morning, while events that honor 
the life and work of Dr. King replace 
afternoon classes. This policy ensures 
that we remember the legacy of Dr. King. 
I support this policy and encourage you 
to make the most of this day on by par
ticipating in the wonderful events orga
nized by the Martin Luther King Jr. Day 
Planning Committee.
The program begins with the annual 
State of Diversity Address, delivered by 
University President Jared L. Cohon, in
which he will discuss recent and ongoing 
efforts to increase diversity in the Carnegie 
Mellon community. The University has 
made great strides in this area and is 
headed in the right direction. However, 
achieving this goal requires more than 
the administrations creating a diverse 
learning environment. For Carnegie 
Mellon truly to be a diverse environment, 
every student must embrace and promote 
diversity on a personal basis.
After President Cohons address, 
students from Pittsburgh high schools 
and Carnegie Mellon students will read 
award-winning essays about their expe
riences with racial differences and dis
crimination. This will be followed by a 
panel discussion of community leaders, 
moderated by Carnegie Mellons director 
of diversity, Everett Tademy.
At 4:30 pm, members of the com
munity will gather for the Candlelight 
Procession. This march is a symbolic 
reminder of the marches led by Dr. King 
for civil rights. The Procession will end 
in the University Center, where Darlene 
Clark Hine will deliver the Martin Luther 
King Jr. Day Keynote Address.
We are honored to have Dr. Hine speak 
on our campus. She has served as a pro
fessor of history at many prestigious 
universities and has edited and written 
widely on African-American history. 
She is co-editor of The Harvard Guide to 
African-American History and co-author 
of a two-volume African-American his
tory textbook, The African-American 
Odyssey, among numerous other publica
tions. Hine has received many honors, 
such as the Otto Wirth Alumni Award for 
Outstanding Scholarship from Roosevelt 
University and the Special Achievement
Award from the Kent State University 
Alumni Association. She has also been 
awarded grants from the American 
Council of Learned Societies, the 
National Endowment for the Humanities, 
the Rockefeller Foundation, and Ford 
Foundation.
I encourage you to attend all of these 
events and make a personal effort to 
increase diversity in your daily life. Take 
a course that challenges your view of the 
world, work to bridge the gaps between 
different groups of friends, learn about 
cultures different from yours, and be 
respectful of everyone around you. It is 
through small steps such as these that we 
can begin to work against Americas his
tory of racial discrimination and toward 
Dr. Kings vision of a nation where people 
are judged not by the color of their skin 
but by the content of their character.
Medical Intoxication

A Resident Assistant in 
Veronica apartments called 
Carnegie Mellon Police to 
report a heavily intoxicated 
resident in need of medical 
assistance. The intoxicated 
students roommate alerted 
the RA after his roommate 
rushed into the apartment 
around 3 am and began vom
iting violently. CMU EMS 
responded to the incident 
and administered initial 
treatment, but called City 
EMS, which brought the stu
dent to UPMC Presbyterian. 
CMU Police issued no state 
citation for underage con
sumption of alcohol per the 
Universitys Alcohol Medical 
Assistance Procedure. The 
procedure grants amnesty 
from University disciplinary 
and police action to students 
when medical assistance is 
summoned for intoxication.

ing an end-of-semester 
room check. The housefel
lows found and confiscated 
numerous roaches, cigarette 
rolling paper, several twigs 
of suspected marijuana, 
and a fifth of Chopin vodka 
from the rear bedroom. 
Housefellows inspect each

A student reported that he 
had been ripped off by 
someone outside of the UC. 
The student said he was 
approached by an unknown 
person who asked to bor
row $30 from him for a 
Greyhound bus ticket to 
West Virginia. The unknown 
person promised the student 
that he would return the 
money. The two exchanged 
names and telephone num
bers, but the student later 
found that the telephone 
number given to him was
phony. The student reported 
that the unknown person 
had mentioned having just 
been at a party at the frater
nities and then walked back 
towards the fraternity quad.
Defiant Trespass
January 10, 2005 at 
13:21
Residents of Doherty 
Graduate Apartments D 
Tower reported waking up 
in the middle of the night 
to find five strangers using 
the computers in their liv
ing room. One resident told 
officers that he went to bed 
around 2 am, but was woken 
up by noises coming from 
the living area of the suite. 
He got out of bed to investi
gate and found three males 
and two females using the 
computers in the living area. 
The resident said he had 
seen one of the individuals 
with one of his roommates 
in the past, but did not 
know any of the individuals 
by name. He asked them to 
leave, and they complied. 
The resident said he knew he 
had locked the door. A short 
while later, before returning 
to bed, the resident heard 
a keycard being swiped 
and a PIN being entered. 
The door opened, and the 
same five individuals tried 
to reenter. The resident 
prevented their entry. The 
housefellow, Residence Life, 
and the Assistant Director of 
Housing were notified. An 
investigation is ongoing.
Dangerous Weapon in the 
UC
January' 13, 2005 at

A member of the University 
staff reported that someone 
in the UC was carrying an 
exotic and dangerous weap
on. CMU Police reported 
finding a student waiting 
in Kirr Commons, holding a 
long staff with an eight-inch 
blade protruding from one 
end. The officer found that 
the weapon, called a nagi
nata, was dull. The student 
was waiting with his martial 
arts instructor for a ride to 
arrive. The student said he 
had been waiting outside, 
but it began to rain so he 
decided to wait in the UC. 
The officer advised the stu
dent that he could not show 
the weapon in public.

as well as a copy of a W-2 form. Refund forms 
are available online at the citys Web site: www. 
city.pittsburgh.pa.us/finance. Forms can also be 
picked up in the City Finance Department down
town. The forms will be mailed to those who call 
the finance department at (412) 255-8821.
I think they should exempt college students 
regardless because there is no way any of us 
will be making more than $12,000 a year, said 
Valerie Savage, a first-year history major and 
housing office assistant. Kristine Rodriguez, a 
desk attendant and professional writing gradu
ate student, will probably not file for a return 
since she will be graduating in May. Fifty-two 
dollars is a big hit for college students, and I feel 
bad for freshman and upperclassmen that will 
have to keep paying the tax in subsequent years. 
There has been a decline in the city and its sad. 
Campus provides a lot of revenue, so why do col
lege students have to pay?
Occupational tax increases have also been 
proposed in several cities and counties outside of 
Pittsburgh, including Philadelphia.
Summit program 
proves a success with 
students and faculty
SUMMIT, from A1
10 and 20 students, and lasted for two and a half hours 
per day. The seminars spanned from as little as 30 min
utes to up to three hours. No university credits are given 
for taking any of the classes.
While Roger Ma considers this years run a success, 
he hopes to double the participants and expand the 40 
class offerings to about 80 for next year. Ma predicts 
that Summit will continue to be a three day program 
for the next four or five years, [because] people at CMU 
like things in intense spurts. Any longer, said Ma, and 
the students would become uninterested. He also hopes 
that more faculty will decide to get involved. This year, 
Summit received assistance from the Tepper School of 
Business, Student Senate, Pep Boys, and the Ballroom 
Dancing Club, among others. According to Ma, even 
though Summit only costs 26 dollars and provides 
participants with three meals a day over the three day 
period, it broke even because we get a lot of help from 
people who do things pro bono. For example, The 
Culinary Arts: Slice, Dice, and Make it Nice came with 
a 30-dollar meal, courtesy of the instructor.
CIT first-year Raihan Islam concluded that Summit 
has a really high value for a small price. The food is 
awesome, we learn, and we get to have a chill time with 
people we probably havent met before.
Campus organizations plan tsunami relief, rebuilding
Students at Hillel host Israeli consul general
numerous groups are planning 
benefit activities. West Wing 
and Resnik and SDC organized 
a tsunami relief benefit pan
cake brunch on Sunday, the 
proceeds of which are also 
going to BBF. Proceeds from the 
School of Musics January 27 
performance of The Italian Girl 
in Algiers will also benefit the 
Carnegie Mellon relief-rebuild 
effort.
Student Development is also 
planning a dinner on February
14 to benefit the tsunami effort. 
The dinner will be held from
7 to 9 pm in Rangos. Whats 
uplifting is how much people 
are reaching out and helping 
out, said Siddiqi. Humanity is 
showing the best of its faces in 
the new year.

still faced challenges. I expect a difficult 
period, he said.
He also mentioned the recovery of Israels 
tourist industry, claiming that roughly 1.5 
million tourists visited the country in 2004. 
He then said that Pittsburgh had seen roughly 
five or six million tourists last year, prompting 
an audience member to say, I think theyre 
including commuters.
A question-and-answer period followed 
Paltis speech, during which he addressed 
concerns about Syria, Iran, and the new Bush 
administration in the United States. He stated 
that he felt excellent about Israeli-American 
relations for the next four years, but added 
that Israel was bipartisan and didnt favor 
individual terms.

involvement. What is important for us is to 
be on top all the time of what is going on with 
Israel and America. He urged students to get 
to know the facts. I would like to stress, he 
added, how you can represent Jewish life on 
campus.
In reference to his relocation to Philadelphia, 
he said, You find yourself at home, no matter 
where you are.

Five reasons for sports fans to love Carnegie Mellon
Mii'iMHMNtfMP'i
by Christian DAndrea
Sports Editor
Its tough to leave an environ
ment filled with great athletics to 
come to Carnegie Mellon. There 
are no pep rallies, no future draft 
picks, and no packed stadiums 
for any sports on campus. But 
its not all bad. Pittsburgh is a 
great sports city, and there are 
lots of great events that can be 
found by sports fans across cam
pus. Here are five great things for 
sports fans to love about going to 
Carnegie Mellon.
NCAA Division III 
Athletics: Despite a low sta
tus on the NCAAs totem pole, 
there are still plenty of great 
sports opportunities on campus. 
Carnegie Mellons mens swim
ming team secured a third-place 
finish at last years national 
championships. The football 
team hasnt endured a losing sea
son in 30 years. The womens 
volleyball team has won three 
straight Eastern College Athletic 
Conference (ECAC) titles. All of 
these successful teams compete 
right here on campus.
While its true that the 
University may never have any 
future stars or ESPN coverage on 
campus, Carnegie Mellon still has 
athletics at its purest form. The 
athletes here dont play for media 
exposure or the idea of millions 
of dollars; they play because they 
love the game.
Steeler Fanaticism:
Pittsburgh knows its football, 
but the Steelers havent won a 
title in nearly 25 years. This year, 
behind rookie quarterback Ben 
Roethlisberger and a suffocating 
defense, the Steelers have won 15 
games in a row and have charged 
into the playoffs. You cant go 
anywhere in this city without see
ing the black and gold, and the 
frenzy will only get bigger and 
bigger as home playoff games 
approach. Passionate fans are 
a great thing, and Pittsburgh is 
packed with them. If you were 
one of the 65,000 people lucky 
enough to get into Heinz Field on 
Saturday, youll know just how 
much one team can mean to this 
city.
The Pirates Fan Base (Or 
Lack Thereof): Twelve years 
ago, the Pittsburgh Pirates let 
a pre-BALCO Barry Bonds sign 
with San Francisco, opting to 
cut payroll and rebuild. The past 
years havent been prosperous for 
the club, and they havent been 
in playoff contention ever since. 
While this is bad news for the 
organization, its great news for 
students. A low payroll means 
low ticket prices, and the Pirates 
have arguably the greatest base
ball stadium in the league with 
PNC Park. With 20 dollars and 
a bit of luck, fans can get box 
seats a few rows behind the third 
or first base line. Even in the 
bleachers, views of the field are 
excellent, and fans never feel like 
theyre too far from the game.
PNC Park also has great fan 
promotions, including dollar 
hot dog events at every Monday 
home game. This year, the Pirates 
feature exciting young players 
like National League Rookie of 
the Year Jason Bay; All Stars Jack 
Wilson and Matt Lawton; Thor 
look-alike and home run crush
er Craig Wilson; and a strong 
pitching staff led by Oliver Perez. 
When summer comes, dont be 
surprised if this is the best Pirates 
team since Barry Bonds left.
University of Pittsburgh, 
Duquesne University,
and even Robert Morris 
University: Miss the NBA? 
Even though theres no National 
Basketball Association team in the 
city, Pittsburgh has three NCAA 
Division I basketball teams only 
a bus ride away from campus. 
Just down Fifth Avenue is the 
Petersen Events Center, where the 
University of Pittsburghs mens 
team has their home games. 
The Pitt Panthers are currently 
ranked 18th in the country. A 
little further down Fifth Avenue is 
the A. J. Palumbo Center, home to 
the Duquesne Dukes, a member 
of the Atlantic Ten Conference. 
Duquesne hosts nationally ranked 
teams like Xavier, Saint Josephs, 
and George Washington each 
year.
Even little Robert Morris 
University, located about 20 min
utes away in Moon Township, 
has their own Division I basket
ball squad. Though they dont 
have the same tough schedule 
as Pitt, theyre still competitive 
and are only a conference tourna
ment win away from the NCAA 
Tournament. Though tickets for 
Pitt games can be tough to find, 
you can usually buy tickets for 
Duquesne and Robert Morris bas
ketball on game night.
The Penguins Could Be 
Back in Action Before You 
Graduate: It is becoming more
and more clear that the NHL wont 
have a season this year. This is ter
rible news for Pittsburgh, because 
it essentially seals the idea that 
Mario Lemieux will never play 
for the Penguins again. But even 
without Super Mario, this team 
is one of the best bargains in 
town. There is a Student Rush 
promotion at each home game
 students get the best avail
able seats, regardless of location, 
for 20 dollars each. Most often, 
these seats are only about ten 
rows from the ice.
Though the Penguins were 
the worst team in the league 
in 2003, the current stoppage 
is allowing their young players
 most notably former num
ber one draft pick Marc-Andre 
Fleury  time to develop in the 
minor leagues. When the players 
and owners finally agree on a 
Collective Bargaining Agreement 
and decide to start playing again, 
this young team could surprise 
the rest of the league.
At Carnegie Mellon, youre 
never far from a great sporting 
event, whether youre watching 
Division III athletes play their 
hearts out on campus or watch
ing the Steelers roll over another 
AFC North opponent. With such 
a diverse and strong sports com
munity, there is no doubt that 
Pittsburgh is a great sports city.

How Things Work: Typeface Design

V-A^ Q /
17 January 2005 THE TARTAN A5
by William Nicoll
Staffwriter
Type is everywhere. Anything 
involving printed characters, in
cluding the words of this article, 
falls into the vast realm of type. 
As todays most widely used 
form of communication, type 
has seen many developments 
over the years. But its objective 
remains the same: to convey in
formation and abstract ideas to 
others.
Of course, passing knowledge 
from one person to another
wasnt always as easy as it is to
day. Types origins date back to 
prehistoric man and his use of 
pictograms to represent basic 
everyday objects. Neanderthals 
took the worlds first bragging 
rights by scrawling the pictorial 
equivalent of Strong tribesman 
kill many mammoths on cavewalls everywhere.
As time passed, man got lazier, 
and the pictogram evolved into 
the ideogram, which represent
ed a whole concept. Instead of 
drawing a horse in its entirety, a 
symbol was adopted to represent 
it. This was an improvement over

First distant planet 
photographed
Last September, a photograph 
taken by the European Southern 
Observatory reportedly showed 
the first planet beyond our so
lar system. The observation was 
recently confirmed by a second 
photograph taken by the Hubble 
Space Telescope. The planet is big
ger than Jupiter and orbits a dim, 
failed star, classified as a brown 
dwarf. The pair is located about 
225 light years away from the 
earth. Although over 100 other 
planets are already known to ex
ist, those theories rely mainly on 
observational data and shadows. 
These two photographs are the 
first visual evidence of an extraso
lar planet.

Research reveals 
ancient mammal ate 
small dinosaurs
A combined effort between Chi
nese and American scientists has 
determined that the Mesozoic-age 
mammal Repenomamus robustus 
hunted and ate small dinosaurs. 
The finding is based on an R. ro
bustus fossil, found in Chinas Liao
ning province, which contained 
the bones of a psittacosaur in the 
area where its stomach would 
have been. Wear on the animals 
teeth also suggest that the oppossum-sized creature ate the dino
saurs themselves rather than their 
softer eggs. The scientists hope 
their findings will dispel the popu
lar belief that most Mesozoic-age 
mammals were small and served 
mainly as prey for dinosaurs.

Eiffel Towers shape 
derived mathemati
cally
Since its creation for the 1889 
Paris Exposition, the Eiffel Tower 
has been recognized worldwide. 
But for over one hundred years, 
engineers were unable to find one 
mathematical equation that could 
sufficiendy describe the shape of 
the iconic structure, which was 
built with no particular model in 
mind. Patrick Weidman, a profes
sor of mechanical engineering at 
University of Colorado, has stud
ied the problem since 2001 and recendy came to his conclusion: The 
towers profile can be described 
by a piecewise curve consisting of 
two exponential sections.

Replication of first 
star catalog found on 
ancient statue
At the American Astronomi
cal Society Meeting last Monday, 
Louisiana State University profes
sor Bradley Schaefer proposed 
that the Farnese Atlas statue was 
based upon what is thought to be 
the first star catalog. The catalog 
was created by Greek astronomer 
Hipparchus in 129 BCE. Although 
much of Hipparchus work is now 
considered lost, portions remain. 
The Farnese Atlas is one such 
work: It is a depiction of the Titan 
Atlas hefting a sky globe marked 
with 41 Greek constellations and 
the celestial equator. Over time, 
the stars move with respect to the 
celestial equator, and a mathemat
ical fit can allow scientists to turn 
back the clock and see where the 
stars would have been observed 
during a specific year. Schaefers 
formal analysis dated the obser
vations depicted on the globe to 
around 125 BCE; only Hipparchus 
work is known to predate this. 
Perhaps the most fascinating part 
of the discovery is simply that we 
have recovered one of the most fa
mous known examples of lost an
cient wisdom, Schaefer stated in 
a press release.

the pictogram, and remnants of 
the historical use of the ideo
gram persist today in languages 
such as Chinese and Japanese.
But while the ideogram may 
have simplified communication 
to an extent, it did not remove 
the underlying problem that a 
unique character was needed to 
represent every person, place, or 
thing desired. The Phoenicians 
solved this problem around 
1600 BCE by adopting the pho
nogram: a symbol that repre
sented a sound instead of an

Study shows genes to blame for snoozing in early classes
CMU and Pitt woo trustees of renowned Newton collection
by Danica Cowan
Junior Staffwriter
Professors think that those 
among us who have a tendency 
to nod off in class are lazy and 
unmotivated, but the ongoing 
research of scientists at the Uni
versity of Utah in Salt Lake City 
shows we are at the mercy of our 
genes.
Ive definitely been known as 
the type to fall asleep in class, 
said first-year H&SS student 
Eileen Angulo. In high school, I 
would fall asleep in this one class 
all the time. When my teacher 
asked me a question I would 
wake up, answer the question, 
and fall back asleep. I dont think 
he appreciated that too much.
Our internal clock, or circadian 
rhythm, is a complex mechanism 
that tells us when it is time to go 
to bed and when to get up. A bet
ter understanding of this mecha
nism could eventually lead to the 
advent of drugs that would let us 
shift our sleeping patterns as eas
ily as we wind a clock.
A team led by Ying-Hui Fu and 
Louis Ptacek at the University of 
Utah in Salt Lake City made a 
significant step in that direction, 
thanks to a family in Utah afflicted
engineering student James Rogers rests his eyes for the duration of hisSophomore materials science and 
biology lecture in Porter Hall 100.
by an unusual sleeping disorder. 
Members of the family found it 
almost impossible to stay awake 
beyond 7 pm and would be fully 
awake and alert as early as 2 am.
This condition is known as 
familial advanced sleep-phase 
syndrome. The shift in sleep
ing patterns is the only known 
symptom. The researchers con
cluded that the family members 
internal clocks had been shifted 
by three to four hours relative to 
the average individuals. Finding 
and examining the mutated gene 
causing the disorder allowed sci
entists to better understand how 
the circadian rhythm works un
dernormal conditions. The hPer2 
gene is believed to be involved in
regulating the internal clock, but 
scientists do not understand pre
cisely how this gene functions. 
Located toward the end of chro
mosome 2, this gene had been 
suspected because it is analogous 
to the better-understood circa
dian clock genes in animals.
Its the first example of a cir
cadian clock gene in a human,
Joseph Takahashi, a geneticist at 
Northwestern University in Evan
ston, 111., told Science magazine.
The location of this gene may 
also explain why we have a ten
dency to go to bed earlier as we 
age. The hPer2 gene is located 
near a region of the chromosome 
called the telomere, which is the 
very end of the chromosome. 
This region progressively gets 
shorter as we get older. The very 
ends of chromosomes serve as a 
buffer to protect the vital infor
mation stored in chromosomes. 
The hPer2 gene is so close to the 
buffer zone that it may be ad
versely affected by the degrada
tion of the telomere, throwing 
the sleep cycle out of whack.
The internal clock gene pro
duces a protein known as PER, a 
target for an enzyme called casein 
kinase Ie. This enzyme seems to 
help maintain the proper 24-hour 
cycle that runs our internal clock
work. Scientists have discovered 
that PER and other such proteins 
accumulate during the 24-hour 
circadian cycle. When they reach 
a certain critical concentration 
they shut down the very genes 
that created them. This fluctua
tion in protein concentration is

The yearly MacWorld conven
tion in San Francisco has always 
heralded the announcement of 
new Apple products, but this 
year two especially prominent 
ones took the stage: the Mac 
mini and the iPod shuffle.
The Mac mini is Apples ven
ture into the low price computer 
market. At a retail price of $499 
the Mac mini is primarily aimed 
at people who have wanted to 
try out Macs but were held back 
due to the cost.
Apple CEO Steve Jobs said at 
the MacWorld keynote address 
that people who are thinking 
of switching will have no more 
excuses. Its the newest and most 
affordable Mac ever.
One of the Mac minis most 
interesting features is the size 
itself: It is housed in a two-inchtall, 6.5-inch-square anodized 
aluminum enclosure. Mac lap
top owner Wiseley Wong, a firstyear MCS student, said, The 
small size of the Mac mini is jawdropping. Its really impressive.
The Mac mini houses a 1.25 
GHz or 1.42 GHz G4 processor, 
a 40 GB or 80 GB hard drive, a 
slot-loading CD-RW/DVD-ROM 
optical drive, 256 MB RAM and 
an ATI Radeon 9200 graphics 
chip with 32 MB dedicated RAM.

Representatives of CMU and 
the University of Pittsburgh 
hosted an envoy from the Dibner 
Institute last month, in a bid that 
could bring one of the worlds 
three largest collections of Sir 
Isaac Newtons original works to 
Pittsburgh.
The collection itself is unsur
passed and will be an attraction to 
scholars from across the county, 
said Mark Kamlet, the provost 
of Carnegie Mellon University. 
Also, the Institute hosts senior, 
post-doctoral and graduate stu
dent fellows each year and has 
regular symposia, conferences, 
lectures, and workshops.
The Dibner Institute maintains 
the Burndy Library, which houses 
the collection that includes 
50,000 rare books and 30,000 
secondary titles. It has been lo
cated at MIT since 1992, but the 
Institutes agreement with MIT 
ends in August 2007. Now Pitts
burgh is attempting to become its
new host when it becomes avail
able in two years.
The fact that the University of 
Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon 
have formed such a close and 
successful partnership in so many 
areas already makes our combi
nation uniquely attractive, said 
Kamlet.
Johns Hopkins University in 
Baltimore, Maryland; Indiana 
University in Bloomington, In
diana; and a number of other 
Pennsylvanian universities are 
among the candidates to host the 
exhibit.
The University of Pittsburghs 
History and Philosophy of Sci
ence department and its Center 
for Philosophy of Science make 
Pittsburgh an attractive potential 
match for the similarly themed 
collection.
We are already the numberone place in the world for the phi
losophy of science, said Pitt pro
vost James Maher. We are one 
of the very leading places in the 
world on the history of science 
and technology.
He added, This would bring

Arguably, one of the main 
selling points for Macs has been 
their attention to aesthetics. Ap

as the rest of their lineup. Its re

complement to the iPods dock.

That would be quite a prestigious 
thing for both universities.
Part of the Burndy Newton 
collection is exhibited on the 
Internet by the Online Newton 
project, a joint project between 
Babson College and the Dibner 
Institute. The goal of the project 
is to provide online access to all 
of the manuscripts in the Babson 
Collection, as well as every book 
originally published by Newton 
in Latin, French, or English.
CMU has a wealth of experi
ence in digital library develop
ment such as that of the Online

have also championed the Million 
Book Digital Library Project, with 
the goal of creating a free-toread, searchable digital library of 
one million volumes.

iPod shuffle and Mac mini make Apple technology affordable
APPLE, from A5
from its predecessors. The iPod 
shuffle is much smaller than 
even the iPod mini: In both size 
and form it resembles a white 
packet of chewing gum. The iPod 
shuffle has a USB connector and 
therefore its storage can easily be 
used for other files.
Jason Massa, a first-year H&SS 
student and Apple fan, said 
that he would buy the iPod 
shuffle for sure if choosing 
between the two products 
announced at MacWorld.
Hes not alone: even cur
rent iPod owners are looking 
to buy an iPod shuffle. The 
$99 and $149 prices of the 
iPod shuffles two models 
will allow consumers to 
purchase them without 
denting their wallets.
Some market analysts 
have been shocked by 
the surge in public in
terest, as the player has
no display screen and can only 
play sequentially or via a shuffle 
mode through a single playlist. 
Apple will sell two versions of
the iPod shuffle, in 512 MB and 
1 GB flavors.

that the device fulfilledand 
even exceededApples claims 
for convenience, battery life and
song capacity. Mossberg added, 
Sound quality is so good you can 
barely believe the music is com

His main disappointments have 
to do with the lack of a screen 
and the lack of a play list fea

Typeface designers strive for readable, functional face styles
TYPEFACE, from A5
idea. The modern worlds three 
main written alphabets  Ro
man, Cyrillic, and Arabic  are 
all phonographic.
Fast forward almost a millen
nium to Gutenbergs invention 
of the printing press in 1540 CE, 
and we can see type emerge into 
widespread use. With a thousand 
years of written communication 
to draw upon, you might think 
that typeface design would be 
simple. Youd be wrong.
What makes typeface design 
such a challenging study is the 
virtually limitless number of situ
ations that demand a different 
form of type. For example, the 
flashy heading of an advertise
ment may be rendered in decora
tive type that draws the eye. Such 
a type has no business in the main 
body of a novel, as it would be a 
chore to read.
Instead, readability is one of 
the main characteristics typogra
phers try to attain in their work. 
Readability might sound like an 
abstract study, but it is actually 
quantifiable. Scientists have ob
served that blinking is directly 
proportional to eye fatigue, as 
the body uses blinking to rest the 
ocular muscles. Also key are the 
many subjective observations 
that generations of typographers 
have made on what facilitates 
readability. Their search for the 
ideal typeface defines it as some
thing so readable that it isnt even 
noticed. Towards this end, typog
raphers can alter each letter and 
its surrounding space as long as 
it remains similar to the basic Ro
man forms. There are many ways 
to accomplish this.
One of the most basic is capi
talization. In the original form of 
Roman script, a lower case didnt 
exist. It wasnt for 500 years that 
the lowercase forms were added 
to increase readability. As we 
read, the eye doesnt focus on 
individual words so much as it 
focuses on familiar patterns and 
outlines. Strokes called ascend
ers and descenders, like the left 
strokes in the letters b and p, 
vary the height of lower-case 
letters and add distinctiveness. 
WITHOUT LOWER-CASE, THE 
FIXED HEIGHT OF LETTERS
WOULD INCREASE EYE FATIGUE, 
ESPECIALLY FOR TEXT OF ANY 
APPRECIABLE LENGTH.
Another basic aid to readabil
ity is the serif. The serif is a 
finishing stroke on many type 
designs that aids in the horizon
tal flow of reading. The serif in 
the lower right corner of the let
ter A in certain typefaces, for 
example, flows naturally into the 
next letter. Serifs can also play a 
role in adding distinctiveness to 
each letter. The default typeface 
in Microsoft Word, Times New 
Roman, uses serifs. Interestingly, 
the serifs origins had nothing 
to do with readability, but with 
early stonecarvers who had to 
cover the rough ends of strokes 
made by their tools. But sansserif typefaces, first used in the 
1800s, are often harder to read. 
This is why most newspapers, 
like the one in your hands, use 
types that have serifs.
Finally, one of the most in
teresting aspects of type design 
doesnt even involve the letters 
 it involves the space between 
them! Spacing can have an enor
mous impact on the readability
of a type. Withoutspacesreadingwouldbecomequiteaneffort. 
Much thought goes into spac
ing between letters, words, and 
lines. Condensed and extended 
typefaces, which vary the widths 
of letters, can be used when more 
or less text needs to occupy a 
given space; but traditional spac
ing is a comfortable norm for the 
average reader. A process called 
leading facilitates this: named 
for the use of lead spacers be
tween lines of text on early print
ing presses, the word leading is 
still used to refer to the amount 
of space between lines of text. A 
number of factors, such as type
face style, size, and line length, 
all determine the amount of 
leading necessary for a comfort
able read. Try to envision an 
advertisements fne print. Even 
if you were to double its size, the 
space between lines would still 
be very small, reducing read
ability. Theres a good reason: 
Advertisers dont want you read
ing their fine print. The amount 
of leading can significantly alter 
the readability of type, for better
In the digital age, typeface de
sign has taken on a whole new 
level of importance. It also has 
made the design of new type
faces more accessible than ever, 
with computer programs replac
ing the work once done in draft
ing studios. Digital type found
ries such as Roger Blacks Font 
Bureau have led a revolution that 
ten years before would have been 
impossible: Because creating cus
tom typefaces for publications 
is suddenly so easy, there has 
ceased to be a select set of stan
dards used by publications across 
the spectrum. That doesnt make 
designing a good, readable type 
any easier, though  just ask a 
communications design major 
here at CMU.

Newton had deposited in the Cam

Why? What was wrong with you before?
The word Reformed in our name refers to our connection 
to the Reformation of Luther and Calvin. It says that we are 
connected to the ancient church, not starting a new church

the church is not static, and can reform and change. We are 
doing some things very new, but we teach the ancient truth.

Oversimplification of Kings 
ideals ignores his war message
Today is an opportunity to not only 
consider the contributions of Martin Lu
ther King Jr. to our understanding of race 
and racism in America, but to look past 
this simplification of his message and 
reflect on his other teachings, as well. 
These words will not be heard on televi
sion today, as I Have a Dream speech 
repeats have drowned out all other issues 
including both his involvement in the 
antiwar movement and the Poor Peoples 
Campaign. Kings message has been cut 
and sanitized. As citizens of the United 
States, and particularly as members of 
the Carnegie Mellon community, we have 
a responsibility to think critically how 
all of Kings arguments may still apply 
today.
On April 4,1967, at a meeting of Clergy 
and Laity Concerned about Vietnam, 
Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his first 
prominent attack on the United States 
involvement in Vietnam. His opposition 
to the war was already under criticism 
from some of his peers in the civil rights 
movement. The national media then, as 
it still does today, reviled his message. 
Time magazine called it demagogic slan
der that sounded like a script for Radio 
Hanoi, and The Washington Post stated 
that King has diminished his usefulness 
to his cause, his country, his people. Civil 
rights had become an acceptable goal, 
but to call for peace was madness.
Kings words have a resonance that 
carry beyond their original context to 
reflect on the ongoing war in Iraq. As 
he explained: Now, it should be incandescently clear that no one who has any 
concern for the integrity and life of Amer
ica today can ignore the present war. If
Americas soul becomes totally poisoned, 
part of the autopsy must read Vietnam. 
As no-bid contracts and favors for oil 
companies continue to fuel the flames of 
the U.S. war in Iraq, we must agree with 
King that, We are adding cynicism to 
the process of death, for [the U.S.] must 
know after a short period there that none 
of the things we claim to be fighting for 
are really involved. Before long they must 
know that their government has sent 
them into a struggle among Vietnamese, 
and the more sophisticated surely realize 
that we are on the side of the wealthy and 
the secure while we create hell for the 
poor. This reflects on our current policy 
as well: Although Bush insists freedom 
and democracy are our goals, we have 
simultaneously become close to Pakistan, 
a military dictatorship. This blatant hy
pocrisy is not limited to our leaders but to 
everyone who is unwilling to confront the 
awful contradictions between our ideals 
of democracy and our willingness to col
laborate with dictators.
Fortunately, reading Martin Luther King 
Jr. still leaves us with hope for change. 
While Kings strategies for tackling civil 
rights were not fruitful in his lifetime, 
eventually his tactics were successful, 
ending American involvement in the Viet
nam War five years after his death. Con
cluding his speech, King insisted: Some
how this madness must cease. We must 
stop now.... I speak as an American to 
the leaders of my own nation. The great 
initiative in this war is ours. The initiative 
to stop it must be ours.
When we celebrate Martin Luther 
Kings life and work today, we should cel
ebrate everything he stood for.
Inaugural money better spent
on tsunami victims, not Bush
The federal government places a great 
burden on the residents of the nations 
capital. Aside from overbearing control 
on the citys government (in spite of their 
home rule documents), the federal gov
ernment is now weakening the citys abil
ity to defend itself against future terror
ist attacks in order to pay for President 
Bushs vanity.
Washington, D.C. was targeted on Sep
tember 11 and continues to be rated as 
one of the most likely targets for ter
rorists. Congress has appropriated $240 
million over three years to prepare for 
such a possibility. Much of this money 
has been earmarked for such necessities 
as expanded emergency services, hospital 
capacity, and transportation security.
Now the Bush administration callously 
wants it back. The federal government 
is demanding that the District use this 
money to pay for security for George W. 
Bushs second inauguration. The security 
costs are estimated to be $17.3 million. 
Two-thirds of that money will come from 
the citys homeland security emergency 
budget, which should be used to fix mu
nicipal deficiencies instead of securing an 
unnecessary event.
The social aspects of the inauguration 
are estimated to cost $40 million and are 
being funded by private donations. It is 
an affront to society to hold this second 
inauguration in light of the economic 
downturn over the last four years (com
pared with Franklin Roosevelt cancelling 
his own in 1937). It is also an affront to 
hold such an inauguration during war
time (Roosevelt again canceled in 1941 
and 1945) or following Asias biggest 
natural disaster in 30 years. Tapping mu
nicipal funds for what should be a private 
event is yet another inappropriate action
for funding the administrations brazen 
ego.
For the first time in recent history, there 
will be no stipend from the federal gov
ernment to pay for this security. Asking 
Washington D.C. to fund the first inaugu
ration since the September 11 attacks is 
yet another way the Bush administration 
continues to disrespect the city.
Boston and New York were both reim
bursed $50 million for securing the two 
major party conventions this summer. 
Earlier attempts to raise Washingtons 
security budget specifically for the inau
guration were soundly defeated last year. 
Homeland security money should be used 
not for barricading Constitution Avenue 
with police on overtime but for important 
security upgrades and actual protections.
There have been a number of highprofile calls for President Bush to split 
the balance of the event costs. Much of 
this criticism has come from Democratic 
members of Congress, including Eleanor 
Holmes Norton, the Districts non-voting 
delegate to the House of Representa
tives, but the most surprising criticism 
comes from a Republican. According to 
the Washington Post, Rep. Thomas M. 
Davis (R-Va.), charged with Congres
sional oversight of the District, has called 
the Bush administrations withholding 
security funds simply not acceptable.
There have also been calls for Bush to 
cancel the extravagant parties and do
nate the $40 million to tsunami victims, 
including strong words from prominent 
Bush donor Mark Cuban, owner of the 
Dallas Mavericks. President Bush should 
view the opportunity to serve as our pres
ident for a second term as a privilege, not 
as a chance to throw a big party at the 
publics expense.

Despite CBS firings, Rather unscathed
Alexander Meseguer
You may remember a little hoopla 
last year regarding the accuracy of a 
certain 60 Minutes report exposing 
the cover up about President Bushs 
service time in the Texas Air National 
Guard. Seriously though, the already 
battered journalistic tradition received 
a mixed blessing last Monday when CBS 
made the long-awaited results of its 
independent commission investigation 
public, igniting uproar in the journalism 
community and a predictable partisan 
debate. Topics of contention range from 
firings not going high enough on the 
executive food chain to the reports fail
ure to declare a rampant political bias 
throughout the CBS News community.
For anyone familiar with the trap
pings of news reporting, many of the 
reports conclusions were expected. 
However, when one considers the latter 
point of the two mentioned above, a full 
understanding requires careful consid
eration beyond a knee-jerk reaction.
Conservatives will be quick to claim 
liberal bias and express disappointment 
in the commission for its treatment of 
motivation in Rather and companys 
transgressions. Those that do would be 
wise to consider the following quotation 
from Associated Press chief executive 
officer Louis D. Boccardi, one of the two 
commission members, as printed in the 
Houston Chronicle:
We cant prove that Mapes or Dan 
Rather did this thing in order to hurt 
President Bush, Boccardi said. If you 
cant prove it  and maybe, in another
way, the lesson of the Sept. 8 report is, 
dont say it.
Proving that Dan Rather and his part
ners in reporting crime were biased on 
this specific incident is much different 
from merely pointing out a track record 
of bias, which websites like www.rather 
biased.com convincingly do. I say, trust 
the commission. These men are highly 
respected, and one of the best moves 
CBS has made so far was their appoint
ment.
The issue at the core of it all is Rathers failure to recognize the significance 
of having no acceptable evidence to 
support his reporting. Rather remains 
unapologetic for his involvement (or 
lack thereof) in the story. This is truly 
surprising. One would think that a re
porter with over 20 years of experience 
behind the desk would be able to sniff 
out a fishy source. As with his minion, 
Mapes (of whom more detail below), 
he insists that the ideas in those docu
ments represent the truth. Fine, Dan. 
Show us; dont tell us.
While Americans and this aspiring 
journalist have good reason to be sus
picious of anti-conservative reporting 
from Rather, we must keep in mind his 
accomplishments and his retention of 
a nose to the ground attitude while 
enjoying the lofty heights of nightly 
news anchoring. He could be living it up 
in the studio, editing away his golden 
years, but instead he still goes out on 
assignment. (He was on his way back 
from Thailand, where he was research
ing a tsunami story, when the commis
sions report was published.)
Interestingly enough, his hands-on 
attitude might be why he was hardly 
involved in the reporting of this particu
lar story but left the legwork to his pro
ducer Mary Mapes, who was the only 
non-executive fired for her gross viola
tions of journalistic principles. Rather, 
Mapes, and her superiors at CBS News 
deserved to be fired for their grossly 
negligent reporting.
So why is Rather, who resigned his 
spot on the CBS Nightly News effective 
in March, still working on 60 Minutes? 
Despite the scandal, I would chalk it up 
to his name recognition. Mapes, on the 
other hand, is the relatively unknown 
villain here. Despite having an impres
sive track record (she helped break the 
Abu Ghraib abuse scandal), she should 
have known better. Amazingly enough, 
Mapes claims to have violated no ethical 
standards, despite admitting to putting 
the source of the false documents in 
touch with the Kerry campaign  a 
huge journalism no-no.
For Mapes, this is a story with a leg
acy of its own. The seeds of her disgrace 
were sown way back in 1999, when 
the story first surfaced as a possibility: 
It seems like the new memos were the 
smoking gun evidence she was des
perately looking for to end what must 
have seemed like a very long five years 
on the back burner for this particular 
story. I suspect that a combination of 
this desperation and an independent, ir
rational belief in the validity of her story 
led her to ignore her ethical compass. In 
short, the National Guard service story 
is one that should not have seen the 
light of a printing press room.
Alexander Meseguer (amesegue@) is asenior in electrical and computer engineer
ing. He hopes that hes already made the 
largest journalistic mistake of his career, 
which he will embark upon after his grad
uation in May.
Journalistic integrity seemingly optional
Mark Egerman
If the opinion editors of the Pitts
burgh Tribune-Review were lawyers, 
they would be disbarred. If they were 
doctors, they would lose their medical 
license. Instead, their lack of journalis
tic ethics will have absolutely no effect 
on their jobs, because at the Tribune-Re
view, unethical behavior is covered up 
instead of addressed.
Over the winter break, the TribuneReview wrote about one of my deci
sions last year when I was Executive 
Officer of The Tartan; I had chosen not 
to run an advertisement submitted by 
national commentator David Horowitz 
and instead chose to run a statement 
in its place explaining my decision. I 
was surprised that the Trib would wait 
over a month to report on what I saw as 
no longer a topical issue, but I cooper
ated with their reporter and gave him 
as much information as possible. Most 
importantly, I directed him to read the 
statement I had published in that very 
issue that explained why I was not run
ning Horowitzs advertisement.
For reasons that were obvious to me, 
that statement was one of the most im
portant elements of the story. Instead, 
the reporter chose not to read it and 
published instead what was essentially 
an uninteresting piece peppered with 
minor factual errors.
It was obvious what was coming next. 
Soon enough, the Tribune-Reviews ed
itorial board published a piece con
demning my action. That they would 
take this opinion was as predictable as 
their sport pages covering the Steelers 
playoff games.
The Tribune-Reviews editorial page 
really didnt care much for accuracy, 
but so be it. They claimed I quietly 
silenced the advertisement, which was 
patently false. I had clearly communi
cated to the Trib that I had published 
a statement explaining my actions and 
made sure that I did everything pub
licly.
I am willing to be criticized for my 
decision and I welcome it. I made what 
I thought to be a tough decision, and I 
stand by it. If the Trib wants to criticize 
me, thats their right.
What was shocking wasnt their opin
ion; it was their ethics. Let me make 
this perfectly clear: I have absolutely no 
problem with the position the Trib took 
on my decision. My problem is with 
their failure to disclose a conflict of in
terest and the coverup that followed.
Richard Mellon Scaife, the publisher 
of the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, is one 
of David Horowitzs chief funders and 
has been for years. Ethical practices 
would seem to necessitate the disclo
sure of this fact, but it was not present.
As someone who was criticized by 
name in one of their editorials, I wrote 
a letter to the editor defending myself. I 
received correspondence from a mem
ber of the Trib staff and he gave me a 
word limit, which I followed. A few days 
passed and then my letter appeared in 
print.
Or, at least, a letter bearing my name 
appeared in print. I was shocked by two 
things. Firstly, the Trib printed words 
that I simply had not written. And sec
ondly, they cut the last sentences of 
my letter, where I mentioned the link 
between Scaife and Horowitz.
Where I had written: Instead of 
running an advertisement by David 
Horowitz, I chose... they published ... 
running an advertisement by conserva
tive David Horowitz for his book Un
holy Alliance: Radical Islam and the 
American Left.  Labeling Horowitz as 
a conservative is not something I did, 
and adding it does not clarify my let
ter; it merely serves to discredit me. 
Furthermore, the whole story centers 
around the fact that I wouldnt accept 
his advertisement. To mention the fact 
that he had a book, and then name it, is 
to force my letter to advertise for him.
Yet most importantly, the Trib cut the 
following lines from my letter: Perhaps 
it should be noted that the TribuneReviews owner, Richard Mellon Scaife, 
is one of David Horowitzs chief funding 
sources. If nothing else, journalistic eth
ics would seem to dictate the disclosure 
of this fact.
For them to fail to note this when 
they published the article is one thing: 
To censor it from my letter goes above 
and beyond the range of acceptable 
behavior and must be exposed for what 
it is: a coverup.
I cannot put it more simply than this: 
editorial page editor Colin McNickle al
lowed a coverup of a conflict of interest 
in an editorial.
And for the record, Colin, you chose 
not to run George Wills work last week 
because you disagreed with it. For you 
to criticize me for making the same 
decisions you did while covering up 
a conflict of interest is abhorrent at 
best. No respectable newspaper would 
allow such behavior, which forces the 
question: Is the Trib a respectable news
paper?
Mark Egerman (mde@.) is a fifth-year 
student and welcomes all thoughtful re
sponses. He would also like to note that if 
a response is published, he promises not 
to flagrantly alter any writing that is not 
his own.

Redundant nature of award shows detracts from importance
V Ali Kilduff
If youre reading this, then you 
probably just missed the 62nd 
annual Golden Globe Awards, 
which were televised on Janu
ary 16. But fear not. The Os
cars will be here on February 27. 
For that matter, in the coming 
days, so will the Emmy Awards, 
the Daytime Emmy Awards, the 
Grammy Awards, the Screen Ac
tors Guild Awards, the Peoples 
Choice Awards, the Espy Awards, 
and the VHl/Vogue Fashion 
Awards...
The list goes on and on. In fact, 
according to the article Awards 
shows are decidedly not all about 
the statues, by Tom Maurstad of 
the Dallas Morning News, there 
were more than 40 awards shows 
on television in 2004. They cel
ebrate everything from films to 
TV to music videos to personal 
style and pratfalls. MTV alone 
hosts three major awards shows 
in America, devoted to music, 
movies, and music videos, as well 
as major Asian and European mu
sic awards shows.
However, no matter whats be
ing celebrated, all this program
ming reveals the same truth: that 
the American entertainment in
dustry is endlessly and hopelessly 
self-congratulating.
One reason for this recent pro
liferation of awards shows may 
be that they are relatively easy 
to coordinate and produce. Pick 
a spot, invite some people, grab 
a camera, and let the drama of 
winners and losers play out be
fore your eyes. Afterward, en
tertainment news dailies such as 
Extra and any number of shows 
on VH1 can survive for weeks off 
of footage recycled from the red 
carpet.
This doesnt mean these pro
grams are worth watching. There 
are only so many movie stars or 
musical acts to go around in the 
United States, and seeing the 
same handful of people win for 
the same song or performance 
over and over should be tiring. 
Rarely does suspense come into
play; often the audience already 
has a clear idea who is going to 
win, and in the case of music 
awards shows, the evenings in
vited musical performers invari
ably end up taking home the tro
phy. Wheres the fun in that?
Added to this is the risk of 
a tacky, loud, cringe-inducing 
blowout studded with random 
celebrities and pointless com
mentary. Some shows may have 
the best intentions to sincerely 
reward performers for their merit 
and hard work. This still doesnt 
mean theyll be any good. Often, 
these shows seem to plan ahead 
of time what they want lam
pooned on Saturday Night Live.
That said, there are some cer
emonies worth tuning in to. The
Academy Awards, also known as 
the Oscars, remains one of the 
oldest and best awards shows to 
watch; its over-the-top drama 
of recent years has been toned 
down. You can always count on 
the clothes being good, and if 
youre lucky, youll get to see a 
starlet burst into undignified 
tears or Michael Moore booed off 
the stage. The unfortunate aspect 
of the Oscars is that few Ameri
cans have actually seen many of 
the nominated films, especially if 
they are foreign or anything other 
than a big-screen blockbuster.
Far more in tune with Ameri
can tastes, particularly those of 
viewers under the age of 30, are 
shows like the MTVMovie Awards. 
This particular show blends the
sophisticated and the silly by 
doling out prizes for Best Villain, 
Best Fight, and Best Kiss along 
with Best Performance and Best 
Movie. Its lack of seriousness can 
be refreshing at times. Of course, 
the downside to a ceremony like 
this one is that these entertaining 
tidbits are swimming in a mindnumbing celebration of pop cul
ture, a lot of which shouldnt 
be celebrated to begin with.
No matter the preference of 
the viewer, there remains an im
portant question: Does any of it 
really matter? Are we going to 
remember  or care  who won 
for Best Sidekick in a primetime 
drama? Does the fact that a film 
wins for Best Cinematography 
mean that people are going to
swarm the video store to rent it? 
Probably not. Of course, a lot of 
hard work goes into making a 
film, and recognition is always 
nice. But this recent influx of 
awards shows, and their often 
ridiculous contents, seems to be 
indicative of one thing above all 
else: Hollywood cant think of 
anything better to do these days 
than pat itself on the back, over 
and over and over again.

Kirk Higgins
As the day of President Bushs 
inauguration approaches, other 
Democrats and I should ask our
selves how we let this day happen. 
How could a President presiding 
over a net loss of jobs, record 
high debt and budget deficits, 
increased poverty, skyrocketing 
tuition hikes, and a mismanaged 
war under false pretenses win a 
second term?
Many Democrats are uncertain 
what path they should take to suc
cessfully shape national policy in 
the future. The first step occurs in 
February, when party delegates 
will meet to elect a Democratic 
National Committee Chair who 
can hopefully communicate a re
assuring, credible, and optimistic 
theme to the electorate.
Democrats must evaluate and 
critique their strategy, tactics, 
and image if they want to start 
winning elections. First, we need 
to first admit that we lost the last 
three Congressional elections. 
No more excuses; no more Bush
stole the election.
Although Bushs victory in 2000 
was a scant 530 votes in Florida, 
he defeated a candidate embrac
ing prosperity, peace, and incum
bency. In 2002, Republicans won 
more seats in a mid-term election
 a rare feat  and regained the 
Senate which they had only lost 
due to one Senators switching 
parties in 2001. Then in 2004 af
ter the four years of Bushs tumul
tuous term, Bush not only won a 
majority of the votes; he wid
ened the gap Republicans held 
over Democrats in the Senate and 
the House. Democrats shouldnt 
downplay those results.
Furthermore, a significant fac
tion within the Democratic party 
is beginning to feel ignored and 
uncomfortable. During the 2004 
campaign, John Kerry conceded 
the South and Midwest by Sep
tember. His entire strategy was 
rolling the dice on Florida or 
Ohio. This plan of action cant 
win Democrats elections.
While the GOP allowed so
cial liberals and moderates like 
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and 
Senator John McCain to speak at 
their convention, Democrats have
been noticeably hostile to dissent
ers in their own party, including 
pro-lifers and centrists from the 
South and Midwest. Many South
ern gubernatorial and U.S. Sen
ate candidates avoided public ap
pearances with Kerry and other 
party leaders alike were in fear 
theyd irreparably tarnish their 
own campaigns. Bush never had 
an epidemic of local Republicans, 
moderates and conservatives 
fearing to be associated with him 
or his campaign.
The leading candidates to re
place outgoing DNC Chair Terry 
McAuliffe include former Presi
dential candidate Howard Dean; 
Tim Roemer, a pro-life U.S. Con
gressman; and Simon Rosenberg, 
president of the New Democratic 
Network.
While McAuliffe was great at 
fundraising, hes been a terrible 
face for the party. His interviews 
are often filled with vitriolic antiBush rhetoric that distracts our 
party from focusing upon a more 
constructive agenda for the coun
try. We cant risk having another 
chair that will appear divisive 
and out of touch.
While I was a proud supporter
of Dean during the primary, I 
believe electing him to the DNC 
chairmanship would be a huge 
mistake.
Unlike most of his supporters, I 
had admired Dean before he rose 
to fame on the basis of his guber
natorial record. He balanced the 
state budget, expanded health 
care, protected civil unions 
and gun ownership rights, and 
worked across the aisle as gover
nor and National Governors As
sociation Chair. I also liked his 
honest, steadfast opposition to 
the Iraq war. However, it was 
disappointing when Dean started 
running his campaign as a hard 
leftist who embraced Moveon. 
org, pacifists, and other uncom
promising ideologues. Dean 
chose to garner publicity through 
controversial remarks instead of 
well-thought out statements as
suring confidence and good judg
ment on behalf of his party.
Either Rosenberg or Roemer 
would make a good DNC chair. 
Rosenberg has experience us
ing electoral dynamics to shape 
the Democratic message to each 
state instead of letting Wash
ington insiders dictate one message to the nation. Tim Roemers 
background as a loyal moderate 
Democrat could give our party 
a needed facelift in many areas. 
Any other candidate Ive not 
mentioned would still be a better 
choice than Dean. His baggage 
cant get us new voters and can 
only hurt the party in the same 
way Newt Gingrich hurt Bob Dole 
in the 90s.
Certainly a stronger Repub
lican candidate than Bush could 
bring more disarray to our party 
in the future. In 1984, President 
Reagan won 60 percent of the 
popular vote without waging a 
war. Many of his supporters were 
Democrats.
We cant afford to lose any 
more Democrats due to purists 
being anal over details in our 
platform. We need either Tim Ro
emer or Simon Rosenberg to take 
charge and sell the Democratic 
platform effectively to every part 
of our nation.

The Tartan printed an editorial about the place of engineers in society and why they 
were not accorded the same social status as those with professional degrees such as 
doctors. The author called for strengthening of liberal arts education for engineers, so 
as to replicate the pre-technical training years of other professionals.

Mellon Institute of Science searched for a new name to alleviate confusion between 
itself, the building of Mellon Institute (MI), and the Carnegie-Mellon Institute of 
Research (CMIR). With parts of the college located in three buildings, including 
MI and CMIR (the former research branch of the Mellon Institute of Research, also 
located in MI), visitors and mail were often directed to the wrong place. Among the 
suggested names was Mellon College of Science, which was eventually adopted.

Evil CD earns good marks
Adam Evil releases Necessary Evil
Adams Evil & the Outside Royalty play a set in a small venue. They were named artists of the month by 
drtune.net in September 2004.
Every rock band needs a cello and a violin, and 
if you want proof, its time to pick up Adam Evil 
& the Outside Royaltys Necessary Evil.
The first and only time I had heard this band be
fore was the time they played an acoustic set in 
Skibo Caf last year, so I wasnt prepared when 
the first track began with such a rapid guitar 
riff. I was even more surprised when the lead 
singer, Adam Evil, let out a croon that would 
make former Roxy Music member Bryan Ferry 
stand and do a double-take.
The seven songs on Necessary Evil are good 
tracks. I could express my distaste for the last, 
which begins with a local radio DJ praying to his 
Adam Evil shrine and ends with a Harley com
mercial, but Ill allow it since Pittsburgh bands 
need all the help they can get.
However, this bands strong point lies mostly in 
the musicianship and range they show through
out the disc. Adam Evil, whose voice normally 
has the timbre of Eddie Vedders, though not 
nearly as annoying, can sing sweetly at lower 
volumes and scream as well.

never fail to showcase the talent of this group

of musicians, both in musical composition and 
mastery of their own instruments. For an up

flawlessness of their songs.

International Film Festival
Integrating cultures through film
The second annual International Film 
Festival (IFF) began last Tuesday evening 
in the McConomy Auditorium. The festival, 
titled Journeying Abroad, will continue 
into April and provide an opportunity for 
the Carnegie Mellon community to see a 
film from a foreign land each week. Last 
years festival featured films from countries 
whose languages are taught at Carnegie 
Mellon, but this year the festival expanded 
to include films from India, Thailand, and 
Palestine. The festival has, however, con
tinued to host co-productions whose films 
are brought by more than one country.
Two campus groups are behind the creation 
of the IFF: the Modern Languages depart
ment and the Modern Languages Student 
Advisory Council (MLSAC). Yet the festival 
really benefits from the volunteerism of 
students within the Modern Languages de
partment as well as some from outside who 
are simply interested. Also, for IFF 2005 a 
few of the campuss international organiza
tions were instrumental in gaining funding 
and suggesting films that represented their 
cultures. The Arab Student Organization, 
Mayur, the Thai Student Association, and 
the Indian Graduate Students Association 
are all participants in this years festival.
The festival founder and faculty advisor 
for the project, Paz Macias-Fernandez, was 
able to speak about the creation of this 
years festival as well as the motivation be
hind the festival in general. The website for 
IFF 2005 states that the purpose of the fes
tival is to provide ...an intentional ServiceLearning project that aims at fostering 
diversity on campus and serving the com
munity. Macias-Fernandez described the 
component of service learning through the 
lens of what it does for others and for those 
who volunteer: The whole idea of service 
learning is to integrate academic and expe
riential learning with civic engagement.... 
They [the student volunteers] are making 
progress in their academic disciplines and 
at the same time serving the community.
Volunteers among students and faculty 
help to work in the festival, distributing 
tickets, coordinating events, suggesting 
films, and fundraising. We made a great 
fundraising effort to raise every penny to 
bring these great films to campus and got
generous gifts from both external and 
internal CMU sources, wrote MaciasFernandez via e-mail.
Susan Gregg, who became president of ML
SAC just this semester, also spoke about the 
current need for volunteers for the festival. 
Of course we recruit people from MLSAC 
directly, but our organization isnt really too 
big, said Gregg, who is a junior majoring in 
business administration and German. Im 
going to be going around in the next week 
or so to as many Modern Languages classes 
as possible. Gregg may have just recently 
taken over the position of president, but 
she has plans for increasing awareness of 
the group and the festival. I really want 
to get MLSAC and this film festival more 
involved on the campus, she said. MLSAC 
is involved largely in communicating with 
various areas of the school for events such 
as these and also with coordinating volun
teers. Gregg added, I want MLSAC to be a 
way to recruit volunteers and to just get the 
word out about the festival... and then also 
to act as coordinators between Student Life 
[and other organizations].
Some student volunteers assisting with 
the festival are not from the Modern Lan
guages Department. One such student, 
senior double major in computer science 
and economics Amos Boon Hui, assisted in 
the production of the festival by designing 
the IFF 2005 website. Macias-Fernandez 
noted that whether language majors or 
simply interested in the program, the vol
unteers are gaining experience that will be 
helpful to them in their careers.
The background to the theme of this years 
festival was inspired by a frequent experi
ence among college students  studying 
abroad. This year, the theme is journeys, 
encompassing the physical, metaphorical 
and spiritual. The festival had to broaden 
its topic from the literal idea of studyabroad programs, but it still chose to focus 
on travel. We didnt want it to be flat
 like a study abroad theme. We wanted 
it to have some depth. The word journey5 
to us suggests ... a trip, a vacation, a studyabroad program as well as the journey of 
life, explained Marcias-Fernandez when 
asked how the theme developed from the 
idea of study-abroad programs.
Another of the facets of the IFF mission is 
the encouragement of an understanding of 
the current state of world cinema, accord
ing to the IFF website. Macias-Fernandez 
described the goal of the festival and what 
world cinema may be striving for: Any 
other part of the world feels this pressure 
to be the same and to be different from 
Hollywood.... We are trying to get another 
flavor and other cultural views, other cin
ema views. Thus, she added, some of the 
films maybe along the lines of a Hollywood 
production, but many will be deliberately 
distinct from typical Hollywood fare.
A final important aspect of the IFF de
velopment comes from its promotion of 
learning, according to Macias-Fernandez. 
She teaches two classes to two very differ
ent audiences, one called Spain: Language 
and Culture, and one for the Academy of 
Lifelong Learning, a program sponsored 
by Carnegie Mellon that helps older stu
dents continue their educations. MaciasFernandez has elected to ask students in 
her undergraduate course to introduce 
the films before each showing and to lead 
post-screening discussions. Other classes 
similar to Spain: Language and Culture, 
for other languages, are also offering 
students the opportunity to introduce the 
films before the showings. Students who 
do so may be brought to the class for the 
Academy of Lifelong Learning and will dis
cuss the film as experts on the culture from 
which it comes. Macias-Fernandez says 
that placing students in this situation will 
allow for greater learning: Each student, 
she explained, [is] going to have to be the 
ambassador of this culture. She added 
that this creates a unique opportunity for 
enhanced learning and civic engagement.
Though the festival is a form of entertain
ment for students, faculty, and the commu
nity, it is also a way to focus on multiculturalism and a opportunity to involve students 
in a service project at Carnegie Mellon.

Goodbye Lenin! comes to McConomy this Tuesday
Feel-good movie that lacks the sap
Imagine if feel-good movies werent incredibly hokey. 
Depending on your definition of hokey, this might 
seem a challenge, or it might seem to be something 
that you just dont see at Loews Theater. Since Goodbye 
Lenin! is not typical American big-screen fare, perhaps 
its lack of a cheesy ending sequence, lengthy dialogue, 
or tearful close-ups is not surprising. The plot of 
Goodbye Lenin! may have as many turns and directions 
as a Twister marathon, but it rarely has sap.
The film depicts the story of a young man, Alex 
(Daniel Bruhl), who starts his life as an obedient child 
of a highly engaged socialist mother (Kathrin Sass)
 idolizing cosmonaut Sigmund Jahn along the way. 
When the film cuts to Alex in 1989, just before the fall 
of the Berlin Wall, he is embittered toward the regime.
His mother has become an idealistic socialist after the 
disappearance of Alexs father; she teaches in a school 
and conducts an orchestra of young children singing 
the praises of the socialist state. In her spare time she 
writes complaint letters to companies on such laugh
able subjects as malfunctioning toasters.
When one night Alex joins a protest rally to free the 
press, his mother jumps out of her taxi to see what is 
causing the disturbance. She falls abruptly on the side
walk just after recognizing her son in the fray. The film 
continues from the protest with Alex keeping vigil over 
his mother as she lies in a coma during the next eight 
months. By the time she reawakens the Berlin Wall and 
the government of East Germany have fallen.
Courtesy of Sony Pictures Classics
Alexs friend poses as a news announcer to fool Alex's 
mother into believing East Germany has not changed.
Alex is warned not to give her any undue stress, as her 
heart is quite weak; rather than keep her in the hospi
tal, Alex opts to take her home so that she will not dis
cover (as he believes is inevitable in the hospital) that 
the world has changed so much while she has slept.
Here the slightly sarcastic humor ensues. Alexs 
voiceovers continue throughout the entire plot: They 
begin with his view of the first German in space and 
continue to identify the consumerism that takes over 
in East Germany after socialism falls with cold regard. 
To prevent his mother from suffering a possible death 
from shock, he recreates in her bedroom a fictional East 
Germany before the fall. But it is challenging to keep 
her from discovering the truth.
The films focus goes in many directions. For example, 
Alexs relationship with his sister is a subplot that 
flounders and never amounts to anything. And who 
can blame it? It is lost in the midst of several other plotlines: the relationship between Alex and his mother, 
the humor of Alexs attempts to recreate East Germany, 
the love story between he and a nurse, Lara (Chulpan 
Khamatova), and finally the sighting of Alexs father.
Goodbye Lenin! avoids the bleary-eyed style of most 
films about an ailing parent with an over-protective 
brood but cannot escape the confusing pull of its plotline. Yet it is of course never boring; there is too much 
to see, not too little.
Among the most noteworthy achievements of the 
director comes from the evidence of Alexs love for his 
mother. It is never told to the audience; there is never 
a scene in which they coo loving words for more than a 
moment. Yet everything Alex does points to his will to 
keep his mother alive despite all odds, and his love for 
her is evident. The film even avoids American romance 
cliches.
Though a good part of the film is spent with Lara, there 
are no sex scenes, no hilarious moments of awkward
ness, and no traditional break-up with a final, trium
phant reconciliation. Likewise when Alex's mother 
expresses a desire to see her estranged husband, the 
scenes leading to the couples reunion are not played 
out with melodrama or overkill emotion. The film does 
not even depict what happens when she sees her for
mer husband, but rather cuts away to Alex and Lara.
The film turns out a little befuddled, yet refreshing. It is 
always engaging and only preachy once  during the 
end when Alex expresses a, wish for a better Germany, 
one somewhere between the former socialist state and 
the current capitalist one. The beautiful instrumental

score by Yann Tiersen makes the film emotional so 
that the rest of the film need not rely on cliches in 
dialogue and plotline. It is pleasant and humorous to 
watch and yet it stops short of being a typical feel-good 
tearjerker.

Art among academia
Carnegie Mellon students showcase their talents in obscure exhibits around campus
Carnegie Mellon is a university with multiple personal
ity disorder, world-renowned for seemingly incongruous 
strengths. However, highly advanced and specialized 
science isnt quite as far removed from the mysterious, 
romantic world of fne art as you might think. In fact, 
for the number of computer clusters and student-built 
robots that populate the campus, there is also an impres
sive assortment of art in all forms, much of it created by 
students of Carnegie Mellon. Anyone who has walked 
past the College of Fine Arts building late at night and 
heard from within the raucous toots of a saxophone or 
a sopranos soaring song knows how seriously CMU stu
dents take their artistic endeavors.
The New House Art Expo currently on display is a great 
example of the efforts on campus to promote student 
art. On a suggestion from housefellow Shernell Smith, 
New House Resident Assistant Bridget Lewis decided 
to spearhead a campaign to display students art in the 
New House foyer for all to see and appreciate. During her 
rounds, Lewis, a sophomore physics major, scoured New 
House for creative students who might submit work. 
While small, the New House gallery is an interesting ex
hibit and a fantastic reminder of the diverse talents that 
lie within each member of the CMU community.
I want to give people the opportunity to display their 
art and beautify the building, said Lewis. I want it to 
become a conversation piece. The gallery features four 
pieces, one of which is by Lewis herself. Also included 
is a painting by Tori Spindel, a first-year art student. 
Spindels Ice Cream is the perfect visual contrast to the 
Pittsburgh winter, because its subject matter evokes the 
carefree days of summer, and her bright colors stand out 
against the typical gray of the city in wintertime.
The highly detailed pen-and-ink drawings by Gary Tsai, a 
senior architecture student, unlike the other more color
ful works also on display in New House, operate in black 
and white. His subject matter hints at his major, for his 
depictions of traditional Chinese structures are meticu
lously rendered and authentic.
A breathtaking photograph by Natasha Sachdeva, a firstyear in SHS, finishes the New House exposition. Her 
Heavenly Skies is not your typical picture-of-clouds 
photograph; its a refreshing view that diverts from any 
normal student viewpoint.
Said Lewis, Many students here are artists, even if 
theyre not majoring in art. With this project, which will 
continue indefinitely and feature further artwork, she 
hopes to show the community that were not strictly our 
majors.
But art isnt always solely for the sake of form. People 
interact with art on a daily basis without even realizing 
that the creation of function is an art all itself. Such is 
the focus of the School of Design, and students work is 
often highlighted and displayed on the first floor of Mar
garet Morrison Carnegie Hall. At present, the projects 
of the Industrial Design Studio 1 class are exhibited: For 
a project in generating amorphic transitions, the class 
created a series of ergonomic faucet handles. Emphasiz
ing clear function and visual cohesiveness, the faucet 
designs in the display are shown from their inception
 rudimentary sketches of shape and utility  through 
to realistic models of actual working hardware. The Mar
garet Morrison design display is a reminder of the spirit 
of creation that goes into every object of mundane life.
Marshall Roy/Staffwriter
Art displayed outside in the Carnegie Natural Reserve.
By far, though, the most extensive display of art currently 
on campus is most likely the least well known. Many 
people have taken the long, fractured, wooden staircase 
next to Doherty Hall without casting too scrupulous an 
eye into the surrounding woods. Slicing its way through 
the Carnegie Mellon Nature Reserve, the stairs are a con
venient passage down the steep, naturalized area to the 
parking lot below. But lurking in the small area of sur
rounding woods are evocative and extensively crafted 
pieces of sculpture, enigmatic and hidden like woodland 
specters. The first reaction is surprise  something is 
now known that a moment ago was not. But when the 
surprise subsides, an eerie bewilderment sets in: Why 
would art be intentionally placed where it cannot be eas
ily seen? What else might be hidden?
The most salient of these sculptures is the figure of a 
woman constructed from rough and vulgar materials  
chicken wire, glass, hardened foam, vinyl, and tree bark. 
Her arms transform into white branches and plunge into 
the ground. She is rusty, dilapidated industrial rooted in 
earthy austere, and she has the undeniably creepy aura 
possessed by all humanoid art. How one thing simulta
neously looks so inhuman and yet seems to hold within 
it something to which we can immediately relate is what 
makes this piece so strong and affecting.
6WennyaoH /P htSftRI YOO$H

---------------------------------------------------

And there are other things hidden there, inscrutable 
through the trees. Further observation reveals a post 
piled high with leather; a staircase into the depths of 
Doherty laced with brilliant fabrics; a cerulean sink laid 
on its side; an antique oscillating fan halfway buried; and 
an enormous wooden hand that gropes upward from the 
earth, indistinguishable at first glance from the trees that 
surround it.
It becomes clearer: Most of this art was meant, designed 
to blend in perfectly. And suddenly one is surrounded 
haunted  by more and more sculptures, more and more 
subtlety, everything cleverly tucked away in plain sight. 
Two wire alligators climb up out of a hole in the dry 
leaves, their rust a perfect camouflage amid the woods 
winter carpet of dark red and thick brown. One of the al
ligators opens its jaws in what could be a snarl, a laugh, 
or both.
The final stage of this secret world of furtively placed art
Hollywood is a world hopelessly obsessed with youth. 
Most films are told from the perspective of characters be
low the age of 35, and actors often resort to plastic surgery 
and other expensive cosmetic treatments to maintain both 
their youthful looks and the jobs offered to them. While 
this unfortunate phenomenon is difficult to reverse, some 
filmmakers have realized its artistic potential. More often 
than before, aging has become a theme in recent films. 
As the post-World War II generation ages, there is a great 
need for movies that relate to the concerns of this particu
lar audience. Catering films to a slightly older audience 
is a wise move; romantic comedies targeted towards this 
demographic are especially rare.
2003s Somethings Gotta Give showed the unique appeal 
of love stories between characters in their 50s and 60s. In 
Good Company can be seen as the next step in the pro
cess, bridging the generation gap between young and old. 
This film, however, is not a romantic comedy focused on 
a love story between a man and a woman. Instead, it de
picts a relationship between a middle-aged man learning 
to accept his status as a so-called older man in society, 
and a young business prodigy finding the father figure he 
never had.
In Good Company tells the story of Dan Foreman (Den
nis Quaid), a successful head of ad sales at a major sports 
magazine. He has worked for the magazine for over 20 
years, and is skilled at his job. Dans life unexpectedly 
faces turmoil when he is demoted from his job as a re
sult of a corporate takeover and replaced by an eager but 
inexperienced 26-year-old hotshot named Carter Duryea
is utter paranoia. Suddenly every scrap of litter and lump
o fmud should be questioned. Why is that there? Why 
is that there? Why is that there? Sensory overload. Ev
ery shadow of every trembling twig could be something 
more, something that the average viewer would never 
anticipate and never, before then, even attempt to see be
yond its normalcy, its typicality, its blip past an eye on any 
random pass.
Whats wonderful about this quirky outdoor exhibit is 
that it knocks art out of its comfortable surroundings. 
Its not in a hushed museum under flattering light; it cer
tainly isnt protected from the elements. Its thrown onto 
a steep hill, right into the mud and leaves and obscurity, 
and there it sits. It doesnt invite visitors. It lures them. 
There should be more places like the [Carnegie Mellon 
University] Nature Reserve, said Bridget Lewis. One of 
the great things about CMU is a lot of people here have 
talents that you might not know about, which makes for a 
lot of undiscovered common ground. Like rusted alliga
(Topher Grace). Carter is coping with loneliness after a 
recent divorce, and attempts to unsuccessfully establish 
a friendship with Dan, who feels some animosity toward 
his new boss. Dans anxiety is magnified with his wifes 
pregnancy and the decision of his daughter Alex (Scarlett 
Johansson) to go away to college. Alex and Carter meet, 
and soon the two begin dating, attempting to keep their 
affair a secret from Dan.
In Good Company is written and directed by Paul Weitz, 
who last showcased his talents in 2002s About a Boy, 
which wonderfully brought out the magic in unlikely con
nections between people and endearingly showed hidden 
insecurities beneath its characters falsely confident sur
faces. In Good Company succeeds in just the same manner. 
Like most strong romantic comedies, it is an intentionally 
small film: although packed with big-name actors and a 
pop-heavy soundtrack, the movie maintains its credibility 
because it dares to portray the everyday lives of people to 
whose concerns and internal struggles the audience can 
relate. The actors use the script to their full advantage, 
and Dennis Quaid in particular stands out as a lead per
former. He seems to be in complete control of Dan, often 
allowing his silences to speak more than his lines.
By simply moving a tiny muscle on his face, Quaid is able 
to express a full range of genuine human emotion, from 
poorly disguised aggression and humiliation to confi
dence, comfort, and pride. This truly seems to be a role 
made for this aging actor.
Topher Grace plays a strong character as well, managing
tors prowling the spidery underbrush, there is a mass of 
artistic and intellectual diversity here at CMU that might, 
on any ordinary day, go unnoticed. It might not stand out 
upon first glance, but our peers art and talents are there, 
somewhere beneath the mainstream. Just as art might 
simply be strewn out across a nature reserve in a drab 
woods, the vast talents of Carnegie Mellon students are 
sometimes difficult to see through the static of ordinary 
life. But everything deserves a closer look, and very often 
that closer look can be rewarding beyond your expecta
tions.

humor
to bring a high level of authenticity into a difficult char
acter  a scared, fragile boy disguised as a ruthless busi
nessman. Despite his flaws, Carter is sympathetic in both 
his charming enthusiasm and his desire to find love.
As always, Scarlett Johansson is a bit of a scene stealer. 
Without her, the movie would lose much of its magne
tism. Johansson brings a breath of fresh air into the maledominated cast by portraying a character who is beauti
ful, spunky, and intelligent, but something else as well: a 
convincing young adult. She is a perfect addition to the 
film, and although her love affair with Carter leaves one 
slightly dissatisfied, it never appears forced. It is Dan and 
Carters relationship, however, that carries the story. The 
tension between the two is always visible, but one can see 
their ultimate reconciliation coming. After all, they pos
sess the exact qualities needed to help one another grow. 
Thanks to the clever script that never appears to hurry or 
try too hard, one never ceases to believe in the characters. 
Weitz is an excellent director, and sets up many fantastic 
scenes between his actors.
Romantic comedies are extremely difficult to keep fresh, 
as the scope of story ideas is rather limited for this genre, 
and stellar dialogue and acting is always essential. Admi
rably, In Good Company demonstrates that this oftendismissed genre is not yet exhausted.

Future Tenant
Series of short plays are put on in Future Tenants annual play festival
Mandy (Laura Jeanne Cerniglia) is silenced by her kidnapper, Dean (Robert Isenberg) in The Right Mistake."
Dinah Winnick/Staffwriter
Future Ten, Future Tenants first annual ten-minute 
play festival, proves yet again that necessity is the mother 
of invention. Those familiar with Future Tenant might 
feel uncomfortable spending a long play in a space that 
coordinator Brad Stephenson  a student graduating 
from the MAM program in August  describes as very 
raw, and we make no apologies for very little heat and 
no bathrooms. However, there were some amenities: 
beverages were provided by Sage Berlin from Berlin 
International, and the shows themselves were well worth 
the stay.
The small gallery is managed by students from the Mas
ters of Arts Management program, a joint venture be
tween the College of Fine Arts and the Heinz School. The 
creative solution, reached by Stephenson and gallery di
rectors Michael Newberry and Christine Kolodge  both 
second-year students in the MAM programwas to have 
a festival of 10-minute plays. This would not only work 
well with the gallerys limited space but also fit in with Fu
ture Tenants larger goal, as Stephenson put it, to allow 
as many opportunities for as many artists as we can.
The work displayed at Future Tenant has, according to Ste
phenson, mostly been visual up to this point. Attracting 
submissions of scripts for the festival was low-key: We 
want those that have not had their work showcased be
fore. The shows organizers solicited and received over
30 submissions of scripts, and then narrowed them down 
with the help of CMU Masters of Arts Management Pro
gram head Dan Martin and City Theatre literary manager 
Carlyn Aquiline.
The final cut was composed almost entirely of Pittsburgh 
playwrights working in a wide variety of genres. The abil
ities of the directors, actors, and actresses were consis
tently high, although many of the participants were not 
dedicated professional actors. The setup was spare, with 
only a small stage of plywood and two-by-fours in the 
middle of a long and narrow space. Robert Isenberg, one 
of the actors and a writer for City Paper, was enthusiastic 
about the format, commenting that it was nice and and 
casual because it takes away all the bells and whistles 
and really [concentrates] on the audience.
The festival began with What are the Odds?, which fea
tures a couple, Glenda and Jolene (Diana Ifft and Gayle 
Pazerski) who spend their show fishing, drinking hard 
cider, and reflecting on their past. As the only serious 
drama in the show, the play reflects on how even a small 
choice can have incredible consequences on life and re
lationships. Yet the play still found time for throwing out 
witty one-liners, as Jolene quipped, Your odds of dying 
from flesh-eating bacteria are 18 times greater than win
ning the lottery.
Scott Bradley Smith, the playwright of What are the 
Odds?, is an aspiring fiction author who heard about 
the festival in September and decided to submit a piece. 
Smith explained, What I like about plays is that its a col
laboration. In a play youre providing the words and the 
characters. The actors and director help to complete the 
work. Both Smith and Laura Lind, the writer of Unhired 
Help, have had several plays previously performed at the 
New Works Festival.
Linds Unhired Help illustrates a generational conflict, 
unlike the drama of What are the Odds? It pits an overenthusiastic and over-helpful Marilyn (Virginia Schick) 
against the younger woman Jen (Laura Kidwell) who has 
replaced her at work.
The Wrong Mistake, by Kim Zelonis, was one of the fun
niest plays of the evening, with a simple story and delight
ful dialogue. Robert Isenberg is perfectly cast as Dean, a 
wisecracking kidnapper unprepared for his criminal oc
cupation. For example, when his captive unexpectedly 
wakes up, he blames that damn generic chloroform. 
Laura Jeanne Cerniglia plays Mandy, the sophisticated 
kidnappee, who actually has a friendly chat with her

Entertainment Opinion  2005 predictions
Your unofficial guide to this years most exciting and traumatic events
It appears that the sun has finally set on the world of 
entertainment for the year 2004: Critics have pub
lished best-of lists full of stuff only they like, mediocre 
bands have compiled all three of their hits in regrettable 
best-of packages, and teenagers have exchanged every 
single misguided DVD purchased for them by well-mean
ing parents. Thus, its time for me to gaze into my crystal 
ball, look boldly forward, and reveal to you all that will 
happen in entertainment in the year 2005.
Granted, trends and phenomena in music and movies are 
often tough to anticipate  I mean, Green Day put out a 
rock opera last year  but Im equal to the task. Here, in 
no particular order, are my predictions for 2005...
. In 2005, every single rap song to make it onto the radio 
will be produced by The Neptunes, unless that already 
happened in 2004 and I missed it.
. Finishing the job handed it by 2004, every single thing 
ever filmed will be released on DVD in 2005. This in
cludes TV shows that may or may not have ever actually 
been broadcast, yet will still be pretentiously packaged 
as The Complete First Season, as if anyone ever sells 
or buys a partial season of any TV show.
.Thousands will purchase Spider-Man 2: The Complete 
Feature Film.
. Rick Rubin will not shave.
.Lots of famous and not-so-famous authors will pub
lish large bound volumes of fictional prose called 
books. People will read these books. This is my lone 
prediction for the publishing industry.
. Saying that Courtney Love will behave strangely, be top
less, and have run-ins with the law isnt actually even a 
prediction, is it?
.ABC will launch an all-new reality series titled 
Real Reality where contestants compete to be on a re
ality show without knowing that they, themselves, are 
already on a reality show about reality shows. This will 
cause me to gnaw my own arm off.
. The X will suddenly realize that The Clarks are incredi
bly lame and will end the practice of playing their songs 
as if they were an actual national rock band. The movie 
industry will trumpet the fact that 2005 was "the biggest-grossing box office year ever!"
. The movie industry will continue not to grasp the con
cept of inflation.
. Lil Jon will, at some point, take a short break from being 
crunk. Do not be alarmed.
. Spike TV will change its name again, since its been a few 
months since the last time.
. The fourth installment of American Idol will capture the 
hearts and minds of viewers across the nation, and by 
viewers I mean 13-year-old girls. The winner will 
enjoy the fame, superstardom and instant recognizability now enjoyed by those unforgettable past three 
American Idols: that decent-looking chick that beat the 
guy with the bad haircut, the large fellow who beat the 
short guy, and whoever won it last time.
. HDTV will continue its meteoric rise in popularity with 
the American consumer, none of whom actually pur
chase it, but an increasing number of whom are simply 
enchanted by it while browsing for CDs at Best Buy.
. Seriously, Howard Stern thinks people are going to pay 
for satellite radio? Im sure Sirius is neat and all, but 
watch the old ego there, champ.
.Vince McMahon and the WWE will bide their time 
quietly until professional wresding becomes popular 
again. Maybe not this year. Maybe not the next. But you 
know it hasnt gone away for good. And you dont want 
it to, either.
. Every network under the sun will come out with an aw
ful copycat of Desperate Housewives, except for Life
time, which already fills its entire programming slate 
with lower-budget versions of the show.
. Martha Stewarts just-released-from-prison rap album is 
inevitable, is it not?
. The Blue Collar Comedy Tour and Blue Collar TV will 
maintain their popularity among people who wont get 
any of the jokes in this column.
.And finally, in the most stunning development of the 
year, Axl Rose and whatever group of has-beens he cur
rently calls Guns N Roses will finally release the longrumored Chinese Democracy album. Or else I cut and 
paste this item into next years preview.

kidnapper. The shocking climax occurs when they 
realize Dean has mistaken her for his actual target.
The most unusual play of the set was Writers 
Block, a post-modern exploration of the process 
of writing a play. The writer, John-Paul Nickel, cre
ates a drunken playwright scribbling away madly at 
a yellow legal pad, chuckling and snorting as he sits 
surrounded by the crumpled remnants of his previ
ous attempts. Controlling the two other characters 
on the stage, the writer first leads them on a date. 
When events turn ugly, he forces his male character 
to slap himself until he hauls himself off the stage.
The final play, titled Girls Night Out, took place 
inside the garishly pink Girls Night Out Gun 
Shop. More ambitious than the scope of the play is 
the story of an attempted robbery that ends in mis
ery when the thief is hit by explosive indigestion.
Next week, the audience can expect a few more se
rious plays but still a few comedies, including Cor
porate America by Gayle Pazerski, a humorous 
look at office politics. On the more serious side will 
be True Beauty, about a husband and wife with 
a precarious self-image, and The Widowmaker, a 
play on military recruiters.
Part of the appeal of the festival, according to Ste
phenson, is that if you dont like this play, wait ten 
minutes and you might like the next one. Anyone 
interested in catching the second weekend should 
be sure to arrive early, as standing-room-only 
crowds filled the room to capacity last Friday.

Weekly inspiration from the ominously brooding pond
After working for five years straight at the box factory with no time off, Wilbur decided that it was about time 
for a vacation. How would he ask for some time off, though? His supervisor was Virginia, a cranky old woman 
who was never without her brown clipboard. Wilbur didnt know what it was she was always jotting down 
on it, but it couldnt be anything good judging by the scowl that was constantly present upon her wrinkly 
visage. It took a whole week for Wilbur to work up the courage to ask her. Virginia? he managed to squeak 
out finally above the din of the box-making machines. What?!" she quacked, annoyed that her rounds were 
being interrupted. Wilbur proceeded to explain his situation to her, the whole time wincing as if she would 
hit him with her clipboard at any moment. When he was finished groveling, she paused for a couple seconds 
and said, Fine. You can have two weeks off. But I want you to stay an hour extra every night for two weeks 
after you get back! Wilbur was astonished. It had been easy! Thank you, Virgina! Ill send you a postcard! 
He was so giddy that he almost kissed her. Virginia just gave him an odd-duck look and continued on her 
rounds. It was a good thing she and her clipboard werent around, because Wilbur couldnt concentrate for 
the whole rest of the day. He was too busy thinking of where he would go and what he would do during his 
two weeks of freedom!

Powers of Ten by Bill Bernstein Ph.D. by Jorge Cham

---------------------------------------------------

HOROSCOPES
BY DINAH WINNICK
ARIES (March 21 - April 19): How a persons own ceiling fan could have the 
audacity to just fall out of the sky and knock him unconscious is one of the great 
age-old mysteries of human-inanimate object relationships.
TAURUS (April 20 - May 20): Failing to learn its lesson from your last trip to 
the barber, your hair will continue to grow, eventually developing into a disor
derly but ruggedly charming shag as you refuse to cut it for months, in your own 
passive-aggressive way.
GEMINI (May 21 - June 21): Finding the grocery store too far away and no one 
around to impress with your incredible cooking expertise, you will survive for 
nearly an entire week on the remnants of a chocolate cake kept in your freezer. 
I can tell you from experience, it will make for a better week than most.
CANCER (June 22 - July 22): You will not be hit by lightning in tomorrow's 
thunderstorm. But Wednesday, Thursday, and possibly Saturday mornings 
thunderstorms still remain likely possibilities.
LEO (July 23 - August 22): After months of trying to convince yourself other
wise, you will finally learn to accept that all ramen flavors taste the same, and 
its a darn shame, but theres just nothing you can do about it.
VIRGO (August 23 - September 22): Upon finally returning to your apartment 
after 72 hours in a computer cluster, you will find that your chia pet has grown 
to cover nearly 60 percent of your wall space and has developed a rather charm
ing, jocular personality and preference for watching tasteless reality television.
LIBRA (September 23 - October 23): As youll discover this weekend, a bagpipe 
serenade wont work with every girl, but when it finally does you'll know the 
match is a perfect one.
SCORPIO (October 24 - November 21): Remember in 1999 when a seagull ran 
into Fabios face (or vice versa) on an amusement park roller coaster in Virginia? 
That probably wont happen to you this week. Of course, he wasnt really expect
ing it either.
SAGITTARIUS (November 22 - December 21): Its true that youve got haute 
couture written all over you, but most modeling agencies arent into such large 
and numerous tattoos.
CAPRICORN (December 22 - January 19): Unfortunately for astronomers and 
astrologists throughout the greater Pittsburgh region, they live in Pittsburgh, 
and Pittsburgh has cloudy skies. Despite interstellar communication chal
lenges, I can tell you this: Tomorrow it will probably rain, and youll probably get 
drenched again (since your umbrella broke last week). Mentally prepare yourself 
and take it in stride.
AQUARIUS (January 20 - February 18): You will be extremely relieved when, 
by the end of the week, you finally track down a job perfectly suited for your 
own personal needs and interests, paying enough to keep you from moving back 
home and even keep you fed periodically.
PISCES (February 19 - March 20): You will receive an interesting message via 
fortune cookie the next time you get Chinese takeout. Do not trust the cookie. I 
repeat: Do not trust the cookie.

Two Tragic Losses in the Comics Community
WU1 Eisner: 1917-2005
Frank Kelly Freas: 1922-2005
One of the most respected cartoonists in history, 
Will Eisner is considered the father of the graphic 
novel. He was born in 1917 in the tenements of 
New York to Jewish immigrant parents. Living in 
the slums provided much inspiration for the style 
and subject of his future work. Like many promi
nent comic artists, he got his start drawing for his 
high school newspaper.
In 1936 Eisner formed a studio with Jerry Iger, 
and in addition to creating numerous comics, 
they gave first jobs to many artists who would 
later become very well known. One of these artists 
was Jack Kirby, who in the early 60s co-created 
Spider-Man, the X-Men, the Fantastic Four, and 
numerous other characters with Stan Lee for 
Marvel Comics.
In 1939 the collaborative studio was no more, 
and Eisner began drawing comics as newspaper 
supplements. It was in this year that he created 
The Spirit, his most famous character. Wearing a 
blue suit, hat and mask, the Spirit was a superhero
in almost every sense  yet behind his mask he 
lacked any superpowers. The drawing style cre
ated by Eisner for The Spirit became legendary; he 
drew the comic as if he were a film director instead 
of cartoonist, drawing from interesting angles and 
in unique styles.
Eventually Eisner quit drawing The Spirit in or
der to make profit from more commercial proj
ects, mostly for company advertising. It was after 
The Spirit's demise that the cartoon gained a cult 
following, which continues to this day. Eisner is 
equally recognized as an inspiration and artist. He 
wrote books and taught classes about comic art, 
and tutored artists such as Kirby and Jules Feiffer.
Will Eisner died on January 3,2005, after quadru
ple heart bypass surgery. He will be remembered 
for many years as a great influence in the comics 
world.

Within the space of two days, the comics world lost two giants. Mad Magazine cover artist and science 
fiction conceptual genius Kelly Freas and The Spirit creator Will Eisner will both be remembered for 
their important contributions to the comics world.
THIS ISSUE WILL MAKE
* 9*5? SB*? *
Well known as both a science fiction and a humor 
artist, Kelly Freas is best known for his early depic
tions of Mad Magazine mascot Alfred E. Neuman.
Though the character of Alfred was first drawn 
for Mad in 1956 by Norman Mingo for Mad #30, 
Freas took over in issue #40. Kelly took the witty 
character that Mingo established and ran with it, 
creating a series of 30 covers through the 50s and 
early 60s.
His colorful paintings are some of the most 
memorable Mad covers of all time. His first cover 
depicted Alfred E. Neuman as a figure on top of 
a wedding cake, his bride having walked off in 
a trail of icing at the very sight of him. For the 
Valentines Day 1959 issue, Freas decided to give 
Alfred a girlfriend after all; she appeared to be a
clone of Alfred, only with curly red hair. For the 
1960 election season, Freas painted Nixon, Ken
nedy and other candidates all holding signs saying 
Alfred E. Neuman for President and I Like Alf. 
This cover began the tradition of nominating Al
fred for President every four years, a tradition that 
finally ceased (for no good reason) in 2000. In ad
dition to his magazine covers, Freas also painted 
countless covers for Mad paperbacks.
Norman Mingo returned to Mad in 1962, and 
though his covers are probably more well known 
in the long run, the Freas years will never be for
gotten by Mad enthusiasts. His covers represented 
the golden years of Mad better than any other 
single artists work. Frank Kelly Freas died of old 
age on January 2, 2005, at 82.

Irreversible
.lywu3FJM g25T25R N
There are two recent movies named Irreversible. One of the 
films focuses on the emotional complexities of rape, vigilante 
justice, and feelings of powerlessness and frustration. The other 
is about the challenges of an obsessive-compulsive individual 
and the difficulties he faces when he gets fired from his job. AB 
is showing the former, a widely-praised French film that looks 
to be a powerful and challenging experience. The other one 
looks good, too; maybe theres something about the name.
The Incredibles
.VukFJM 5, 7:30,10,12:30}
This is one of those rare movies that I can universally recom
mend for all audiences. More complicated than a simple chil
drens movie, this is an intricate and often subtle film that com
pletely transcends the previously limited range of CGI films. In 
fact, youll often forget that this is an animated film as exten
sive action sequences keep you excited. Its not just that there 
is something for everyone, but that there are many things for 
everyone.
Resident Evil: Apocalypse
.EJrwuFJM 8,10,12J
Okay, so I thought this was a video game. Im pretty sure that I 
am correct on this one and Ill be honest, Im not a huge fan of 
video games these days. Shoot-em-ups never really did anything 
for me, so Im probably not going to go to this movie. However, 
Milla Jovovich is in it, and according to the trailer, it seems that 
there is nothing to wear after the apocalypse except fishnet 
stockings. That might appeal to some of you, but not fish. They 
hate fishnets.
The Manson Family
.EwWFJM 8,10,12]
In the 1930s, New Yorker cartoonist Charles Addams began 
running a series of cartoons featuring various morbid charac
ters such as Fester, Morticia, and Lurch. This film has absolutely 
nothing to do with the Addams Family franchise that grew out 
of these cartoons. Jim Van Bebber gained a significant amount 
of respect for Deadbeat at Dawn, and this film was widely an
ticipated It should come as no surprise that a film that takes 
Charles Manson as its subject is dark and difficult to watch at 
times, but maybe if you hum the Addams Family time through
out, youll feel better.
