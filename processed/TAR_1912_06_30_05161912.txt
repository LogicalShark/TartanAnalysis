RAISIG WINS FAME.
Clinches Game While Cajts Holds 
Duquesne Safe.
On Wednesday, May 8th, the Var
sity won the first of a series of three 
games with Duquesne University, 
playing on the Bluff, where the 
latter school is located. A fitful rain 
cleared away in time to allow the
game to be started at 4:15. Each 
team had a long string of victories 
to its credit and a close game was 
expected, everyone predicting a pitch
ers battle between Carts and Mee
han, the stars of the rival teams. 
None of the spectators was disap
pointed, for each of the pitchers did 
the greater part of the work for his 
team. Carts struck out 14 of the
35 men that faced him, and assisted 
in putting out two more. Meehan 
was credited with 17 strike-outs, three 
assists and one put-out of his own, 
his opponents having come up to the
bat 37 times. Carts had the better
control and kept Duquesnes five hits 
so scattered that they were never 
dangerous.
In the second inning, Hall beat out 
a bunt and went second on a passed 
ball, reaching third on a dropped 
throw by Clougherty, the second 
baseman. He was left there as three 
men struck out. The Plaid team 
won a three-run lead in the fourth, 
when DeMuth hit a single into right 
garden, then stole second. Wehr fiied 
out to the catcher, Joyce. Meehan 
then walked Hall and Gearhart suc
cessively, filling the bases. Moor
head fanned, much to his disappoint
ment. Raisig waited until he had 
three and two called on him, then, 
when he had the fans nerves suffi
ciently taunt, he swung on the sphere 
for a pretty two-bagger, scoring three 
men. Carts grounder was handled 
by Cap. Wise.
In the fifth, Mcllvaine was called 
out on strikes, but Vail hit for two 
bases, going to third on a passed 
ball. DeMuth also fanned. Wehr, 
to repeat the story, laid a long one 
against the foot of the fence and 
rested at second after scoring his 
captain. Hall fanned.
One more came in the eighth thusly. Wehr tried to make a pancake of 
the leather-bound sphere, but only 
succeeded In hitting it into left center 
for three bases. Hall hit over short 
for one, Wehr scoring. Hall pur
loined second while Gearhart was
missing three good ones. Moor
head sacrificed, but Hall was caught 
off third, and the side retired.
Duquesnes lone run came in the 
ninth. Wise hit a single into middle, 
and went to second on Gallaghers
hit to right. He stole third and was 
called safe at home on a double

SEAUNACHIE FOUNDED.
For some time there has been in 
the process of formation a new so
ciety in Carnegie Tech. As it is in 
no sense a secret society, its founders 
have waited only for the completion 
of organization before announcing its 
existence, aims and purposes to the 
students and to those affiliated with 
the schools.
Because of the distinctive object 
and ideas of the society, its name was 
the cause of greatest debate and con
sideration. A Scottish name of a 
bard whose office was to preserve 
tradition of his race and to celebrate 
momentous occasion was finally 
adopted as signifying the origin of 
the schools, as well as typifying the 
aims of the organization. This name 
is Seaunachie.
The active membership is iimiteu 
to thirty undergraduates, each of 
whom must be a member of one of 
the two upper classes in one of the 
three mens schools and must parti
cipate actively in any of the recog
nized student activities. Graduate 
and honorary memberships are also 
provided for.
The object of the Seaunachie is to 
promote social life among the under
graduates by taking the initiative in 
all matters of student interest or con
duct not provided for by other recog
nized student organizations. The 
aim is that the society shall never 
become political, but shall represent 
student ideals and promote the best 
conditions.
The following men compose the 
original membership:
G. S. Blair, Manager Basketball.
W. G. Blanchard, Varsity C man.
E. R. Boots, Track Captain.
W. H. Buente, Assoc. Ed. Tartan. 
L. H. Button, Pres. Musical Clubs.

THURSDAY MORNING 
LECTURE.
Mr. Macbeth, of the MacbethEvans Glass Co., one of our trustees, 
spoke to the students of the Science 
School last Thursday morning. The 
subject was The Process of Glass 
Manufacture, and Mr. Macbeth was 
right at home in this field, giving a 
comprehensive and precise account 
of the essentials of the business. He 
stated that his company is now mak
ing eight kinds of clear glass and told 
us the different requirements which 
gave the different kinds of glass their 
properties. The great trouble is in 
getting sand free from Fe and Mg. 
It must be fine enough to pass thru 
a 40-mesh sieve, and is then melted 
at a high temperature.
The speaker also gave a brief 
resume of the evolution of the glass 
business, which was quite general in 
its nature and interesting on th|e 
whole. Mr. Macbeth concluded his 
talk by describing how glass novel
ties, like paperweights, are made.---------------o---------------

THE SCIENCE CLUB ROOM.
Owing to lack of space in last 
weeks issue The Tartan was unable 
to print an article it had upon the 
new Science Club Room. The Tar
tan trusts that the committee will 
understand that it was not lack of 
interest in the project but rather lack 
of space which caused it to refrain 
from commenting upon the appear
ance of the room and from congratu
lating the committee upon its splen
did work and the student body of the 
| School of Applied Science upon its 
; new acquisition.
PENN WINS TRIANGULAR 
MEET.
Although the track team failed to 
score any points in the triangular 
meet with Carlisle and Penn, they 
showed up remarkably well in the 
fast company. In many of the events 
our men were pushed into fourth 
places by narrow margins. This was 
true in the mile especially. Wait ran 
a pretty race and was barely nosed 
out in the finish in which he and the 
place men were bunched so closely 
that the winners were picked with 
difficulty.
Hosey set the pase in the 440-yard 
dash for most of the way, but his 
lightness was a serious handicap on 
the stretch which was swept by a 
strong wind, and he was passed by 
the heavier men.
Chuck Crawford pushed the win
ners of the low hurdles and lost a 
place by a fraction of a yard. Grupp 
in the two-mile also ran well but was 
beaten by more experienced runners.

The Tartan begs to call to the at
tention of the student body an article 
appearing elsewhere in this issue con
cerning the Student Federation, re
cently formed at Columbia Univer
sity. Some time ago The Tartan re
printed from the New York Times 
an article in which the plan was out
lined. Apparently the various stu
dent activities of the University have 
after consideration, deemed it advis
able to put the scheme into operation. 
The Tartan prints it for what it may 
be worth and in the hope that it may 
at least furnish food for thought to 
those who are interested in a similar 
situation here at Carnegie.
---------------o-----------------
THE ALUMNI ISSUE.
The Alumni Association of the 
Schools of Applied Science and De
sign, as announced some time ago, 
voted to take an issue of The Tartan 
and run it as a strictly Alumni issue. 
The issue chosen is the one of May 
23rd. The Committee in charge has 
received many letters in response to 
its call and the issue promises to be 
a ver3' interesting one.
---------------o-----------------
ATHLETICSARE THEY 
WORTH WHILE?
We hear much these days about 
intercollegiate athletics and the ques
tion is continually raised, Are they 
worth while? Each side has many 
able supporters and the question is 
a very interesting one. It is surpris
ing sometimes to see the stand taken
by prominent men upon this question.
It is essentially a student question, 
it seems to us, a question which 
should be decided by the students 
for themselves. They have to stand 
back of and support athletics if they 
are to be. For this reason The Tar
tan would like to obtain from the
members of the student-body in this 
institution expressions concerning the 
advisibility of continuing our present 
athletic policy together with any sug
gestions or changes which anyone 
may have to offer. The Tartan asks 
for these solely with the view of get
ting together in as concrete a form 
as possible the views of our studentbody upon our own problem in order 
that our athletics may represent as 
nearly as possible the conceptions 
which our students may have for
them. The Tartan will print the let
ters received and endeavor to formu
late from their expressions what it 
finds to be the desire of the majority. 
It trusts a sufficient number of these 
letters will be received to enable it 
to do this.
J THE DEANS COLUMN. |
May 7th, 1912.
Dear Mr. Editor:
You kindly asked me to write you 
a few lines about our School, and as 
I judge from the past that this col
umn will remain strictly between our
selves, it might be the place in which 
to tell you confidentially that we of 
the Applied Design have set ourselves 
up, by the fact of belonging to this 
School, as the exemplars of the more 
beautiful and consequently more joy
ous side of life. A good definition of 
beauty is pleasure objectified, and 
it is our profession to encourage and 
create beauty and thereby increase 
pleasure for ourselves and others. 
This idea is our constant companion 
and that is why, even though some
times subconsciously, we endeavor to 
show some special thought in our 
dress and in our manners, and some 
exercise of critical selection in our 
pleasures, and especially Harmony in 
all our surroundings as far as may be. 
But Harmony to the nth power is 
of course identityuniformity, mon
otonyand we must seek the just 
proportion between this and over
stimulation, and never forget that it 
is beauty and joy for which we are 
seeking. In our homes above all we 
are held responsible for beauty. We 
may be poor, or only beginning our 
education, but there are few or none 
of us who cannot influence for the 
better, and we must see to it that the 
less good give way to the more har
monious and appropriate. Cyclonic 
arrangement of ill-assorted pictures 
or furniture is up to us, and we 
can almost do something in the direc
tion of balance, of symmetry, or at 
least towards suppression of the ir
reconcilable elements. We endeavor 
not to have our special ideas of joy 
interfere with the balance of the 
whole picture. We count on you, 
however, Mr. Editor, for sympathetic 
recognition of our human limitations, 
and for that which should be our 
guiding principle, Construction, and 
not Destruction, Criticism, or, more 
colloquially speaking, what we call
Boosting and not Knocking. You, 
I know, will not call us conceited, 
for you know that you or anyone who 
is successful must feel slightly super
ior to the common herd, only remem
bering that he must be superior to 
himself before having occasion to 
blow about it.
According to this constructive 
principle you must have noticed how 
we take advantage of all the oppor
tunities of aesthetic culture offered, 
without complaining that there are 
not more. For instance, when the 
Kneisel Quartette plays, instead of 
saying that it is too deep for us, we 
rush to hear it, murmuring to our
selves that many persons consider 
this the real thing and we must get 
on board. In discussing the award 
of first prize in the great Interna
tional Exhibition of paintings, we 
realize that this has been made by 
persons who have undoubtedly given 
more time and consideration to the 
subject than we have, and we try our 
best to discover what the reasons 
were which influenced their judg^ 
ment. Before condemning the word
ing of the School motto we search 
our fertile brains for better, and not 
until we are certain of having done 
this do we say that it is rotten.
I can hardly believe that there 
might be any student in our School 
who would not agree with this, but 
if you should hear of such, please 
have his, or even her, subscription to 
the Tartan stopped at once and send 
the student to me.

WIRELESS.
Last Friday night the first intelli
gible message was picked up by our 
wireless station on the top floor of 
the Industries Building. Unfortu
nately the operator of the other sta
tion was not very good at reading 
messages, so that ordinary conver
sation was impossible. The present 
capacity of our station is about 150 
miles, so that as long as the new sta
tion in Machinery Hall remains un
completed, it will be impossible to 
send messages to stations at any con
siderable distance. The distance from 
which messages can be received, how
ever, is almost unlimited, and by ad
justing the station to the required 
wave-length, it will be possible to lis
ten every night to the Cape Cod op
erator sending his messages to the 
transatlantic liners.
It is hoped that the new bill be
fore the House, limiting the activities 
of amateurs in wireless telegraphy, 
will not interfere with the mainten
ance and the expansion of our sta
tion.

ORNAMENTAL LIGHTING 
OF CAMPUS.
The installation of an ornamental 
street lighting standard at the en
trance of the Science Building has 
not only brought about a better il
lumination of the approach to the en
trance but has done a great deal to 
improve the general outward appear
ance of the building.
The heavy parts of the standard 
are made of cast iron, the central 
column being of pressed metal. From 
each of the four arms are suspended 
four 60-watt tungsten lamps. On 
the top of the standard is mounted 
a 100-watt tungsten lamp. All lamps 
are enclosed in diffusing ball globes.
Mr. Allen Bright, Electrical Engi
neering, 1911, had charge of the erec
tion of the standard for the MacbethEvans Glass Company of Pittsburgh, 
and will perform photometric tests 
from time to time, taking illumination 
readings with a portable photometer 
at various stations about the standard. 
Comparative tests will be made using 
all types of glassware on the standard.
It is quite probable that tests will 
also be performed by undergraduates 
in Illuminating Engineering who care 
to study this new type of street il
luminant.
During the last two years the ten
dency in street lighting has been to 
substitute for the arc lamp, lamps of 
lower candlepower mounted on poles 
from twelve to fifteen feet in height. 
By multiplying the units and placing 
them nearer the street, a more pleas
ing and more evenly distributed light 
is secured. The use of tungsten 
lamps mounted on elaborated iron 
posts was introduced a little over two 
years ago and the popularity of this 
system has been so marked that at 
the present time there are no less 
than three hundred cities that have 
adopted this method of street illum
ination.

THE TARTAN3
COLLEGE TEACHING OF IN
TERIOR WIRING.
Denver, Colorado.
As the electrical industry progresses 
and the mystery formerly shrouding 
the methods of the electrician becomes 
somewhat dissipated by more familiar
ity with the uses of electricity, there 
is a growing demand for workmen of 
approved ability. The estimating of 
installation costs is still, too frequently, 
a matter of guesses whose accuracy is 
a matter for self-congratulation (or 
otherwise) by the electrical contractor.
It is coming to be felt that the kind 
of training in accuracy and observa
tion, furnished by our higher schools 
has a real place in the interior wiring 
field formerly held by .the natural 
genius. We find college graduates 
sought by contracting firms as esti
mators, foremen and superintendents. 
The pay is not large, but this is a fault 
of competition on a guess work basis, 
which these very men will help to 
change.
Recognizing these conditions many 
colleges are adding to their electrical 
engineering instruction, practical ex
perience in wiring, together with study 
of the National Electrical Code and 
occasional lectures by experts on esti
mating and wiring methods. In this 
manner men are graduated, who have 
facility in handling the interior wiring 
problems, and knowledge of such ma
terials and uses as constitute valuable 
adjuncts to their technical training.
State Colleges in the West usually 
include instruction in Interior Wiring 
and. turn out valuable helpers in the 
art. The University of Wyoming, the 
University of Colorado, the Colorado 
State School of Mines, the Colorado 
State College, the Colorado State Ag
ricultural School, and the University 
of Mexico all have taken up this 
work, and the changed attitude toward 
interior wiring is very apparent in 
these states as a result, partly, of 
this study.
C. J. WILLIAMS.
The foregoing is quoted from an ar
ticle appearing in the Electrical World 
March 6, 1912. It is gratifying to 
know that the policies and methods, 
which the Carnegie Technical Schools, 
if not the earliest pioneers, were at 
least among the first educational insti
tutions to put into regular practice, 
have been adopted by so many import
ant schools, colleges and universities. 
The ones mentioned are only a few of 
many, both East and West, which are 
now laying stress on instruction per
taining to materials and methods of 
electric wiring, and construction both 
by lectures and actual practice.
Of course, there are yet many in 
which this work has no place in the
curriculum, but it seems strange that
where, for example, so much time is 
given to the question of design of dyna
mo electrical machinery, in which elab
orate calculations are made to provide 
for the last thousandth of an inch of 
insulating material in a hypothetical 
dynamo and each elusive line t>f mag
netic force is pursued to its lair, that
little or no attention is paid to the
important work of installing the com
pleted machine and its auxiliary appli
ances, nor to the thousand and one 
translating devices of varied character 
to which the dynamo supplies current, 
nor to the selecting of material for, 
and the details of installing, the maze 
of conductors over which current is 
distributed to such devices, and which 
ramify through every part of buildings 
or follow tortuous paths under and 
over streets.
It is in this part of the system that 
troubles are most frequent, that losses 
of energy are heavy, and preventable 
accidents occur which may wreck the 
most carefully designed machine, or by 
causing fire, destroy buildings.
Those responsible for the success of 
the Carnegie Technical Schools have 
given this work prominence, and recog
nizing the crying needs of the thousands 
of men, with no technical training who 
are forced by industrial conditions to 
install and to assume more or less re
sponsible charge of electrical machin
ery and appliances, early provided in 
the School of Applied Industries special 
courses suited to their needs.
Recognizing that the technically 
trained engineer and technicaly trained 
architect should have instruction along 
the neglected lines indicated^, time has 
been allotted in the courses for Elec
trical Engineers, and for Architects for 
the study of Electric Wiring, Under
writers Rules, Fittings, etc., and for 
actual practice in installing apparatus 
and wires, the course bearing the title 
of Electrical Equipment and Construc
tion.

THE TARTAN5
STUDENTS FEDERATION.
Committee Repojts in Favoj of One 
at Columbia Univejsity.
The committee named last month 
to look into the advisibility of estab
lishing at Columbia University a cen
tralized organization embracing all 
the non-athletic activities of the cam
pus, has completed its investigation, 
and made a report favoring the pro
ject. A constitution, presented by 
the committee, calls for an organiza
tion in the form of a students federa
tion, which, besides exercising a su
pervision over the financial interest 
of the associations concerned, will 
be something of a social body whose 
ultimate aim is to be the erection and 
maintenance of the long-projected 
students clubhouse.
As a nucleus for the non-athletic 
union, the committee has recommend
ed that it be built around Kings 
Crown, an organization which, al
though at one time a great force in 
campus life, has in recent years fallen 
into a state of lethargy and useless
ness, through having no very definite 
purpose for its existence.
Following as it does upon the suc
cessful centralization of the athletic 
interests, the projected non-athletic 
federation will be organized on very 
similar lines. It will have an Execu
tive Committee, composed of nine 
members, three from the alumni, 
two from the Faculty, and four from 
among the undergraduates. A grad
uate Treasurer, who will be a salaried 
officer, is to be selected by the Ex
ecutive Committee. 
As the movement for a non-athletic 
federation at Columbia arose in the 
first place because of the apparent 
necessity for a more economic and 
businesslike management of the vari
ous associations, the financial plans 
submitted by the Investigating Com
mittee are of great interest. Mem
bership cards costing $2 are to be is
sued to any student, graduate, former 
student, officer, or member of any 
Faculty of Columbia University. 
Each membership card will entitle 
the holder to a discount of 50 per 
cent, from the regular price of a sin
gle subscription to each campus pub
lication, and a similar discount from 
the regular price of a single admis
sion to each dramatic production, 
public concerts and debate, held un
der the auspices of any affiliated or
ganization. By this means it is ex
pected that subscription lists of the 
publications will be considerably in
creased, not to speak of the added 
profits from the pooling of advertise
ments.
The non-athletic federation as now 
proposed will embrace the following 
activities: Columbia Spectator, Co
lumbia Monthly, Jester, The Dorms, 
Columbian, Columbia Yarsity Show, 
The Sophomore Show, Columbia Uni
versity Dramatic Association, Glee 
and Mandolin Clubs, Philharmonic 
Society, Deutscher Verein, French 
Society, Philolexian Society, Barnard 
Literary Association, and the Debat
ing Council. General financial super
vision and control over these associa
tions will be placed in the proposed 
organization, but its supervision and 
control will be limited to financial af
fairs only.
A definite conception of what is 
expected from the non-athletic feder
ation, may be gathered from the fol
lowing statement in the proposed 
constitution: The object of the feder
ation shall be to foster and enrich 
student life at Columbia University, 
to devise plans for the establishment 
and maintenance of a students club
house, to regulate and supervise the 
collection and expenditure of moneys 
for student publications, dramatics, 
music, and debating in the university, 
and with the advice and co-operation 
of the affiliated organizations to en
courage such interests in the univer
sity.

Probably the most enjoyable event 
of the year for the Musical Club men 
was an informal evening spent as 
guests of Mr. Fields in his apart
ments on Craig street. Music there 
was in abundance, a piano, an auto
piano, two victrolas and a lot of close 
harmony by the clubs. When every
one had a good cigar or his pipe 
going, cards were started). After
ward each man received some sort 
of token to remember the occasion 
by and the awards certainly caused 
a great deal of merrime'nt. One 
man, with a misplaced eyebrow on 
his upper lips, got a package of hair
pins, another received curling irons. 
After refreshments, Mr. Scalzo sur
prised even the mandolin club men 
by his masterful playing on the man
dolin, accompanying some of his 
pieces with songs. Following a lot 
of good singing by the Glee Club 
the affair broke up.
The musical clubs considered as 
a body with one heart, wish to thank 
Mr. Fields and Messrs. Griffin, Marks 
and Williams, who assisted him, 
from the deep down bottom of that 
heart for one of the best times they 
ever had.

6THE TARTAN
DOPING ATHLETES WITH 
OXYGEN.
The lay press reports that Sir Ed
win Ray Lankester has inquired if the 
Swedish authorities, who will have 
charge of the coming Olympian games, 
will permit a Marathon competitor to 
carry an oxygen tank or bag and take 
from it an occasional whiff during that 
cruel and grueling twenty-six odd miles 
that must be run by those who would 
be in at the finish. The competitors, 
he observes, will presumably be allowed 
to consume refreshments while racing. 
It would be extremely interesting to 
see whether such breathing is of mate
rial assistance to the runner; and as 
oxygen gas is not a drug, but as nat
ural an article of consumption as 
water, there seems to be no reason why 
the runner should be disqualified for 
refreshing himself with it, as he may 
with soup or water.
Stimulating drugs are, of course, 
rightly barred from any athletic con
test worthy the name. Oxygen is in 
these circumstances certainly a drug, 
inasmuch as it dopes the recipient, 
quite like many another drug. Pure 
oxygen is a powerful and most valuable 
stimulant for the sick who require it 
patients with coma or pneumonia in 
extremis. But, as with all stimulants, 
excessive and occasionless use of it is 
dangerous. It first excites and then 
depresses; frequent oxygen intoxication 
will prematurely exhaust the individ
uals vitality, and will surely tend to 
shorten his days. Such indulgence will 
make the cardiac beats most pathologi
cally rapid and powerful; the blood 
will flow in excessive volume and 
strength; and the collapse will be in 
reciprocal proportion. The ears sing 
in an oxygen jag, as if one should 
hang the head downward over a cliff; 
speech is hesitating; ideas swarm, but 
it is hard to seize them.
Sir Edwins proposal is amazingly 
unscientific in a scientist of so great 
reputation; and it is most unsportsman
like, especially in an Englishman, the 
Britisher being nothing if not a lover 
of fair play in sport. What folly to 
declare nascent oxygen as natural an 
article of consumption as water! Pure 
oxygen is far from being such a thing; 
it is natural only to be breathed when 
it is diluted with several times its vol
ume of nitrogen.
Pure oxygen has before been used in 
athletics; but all that kind of thing is 
altogether cheap and unprofitable; it has 
a yellow streak. Yes, records have 
been broken by this means. They should 
not stand; they do not in the minds of 
the sporting aristocracy. And the rea
son why is that they are not tests of 
brawn and endurance under the inex
orable conditions in which human life 
must ordinarily be lived. An oxygen 
drunk might make an untrained, unde
veloped, soft-muscled, ordinarily shortwinded specimen successful for the 
brief span of a given contest; but for 
all that he would be the poorer, and 
not the really triumphant man. All 
competitions should be held under nat
ural conditions, such as must be chanced 
and coped with in nature.
The only safe and sane way to 
breathe oxygen is in combination with 
nitrogen as it exists in the circumam
bient air, in the form to which, during 
the ages, human and all other life has 
become adapted. Normal living is ever 
the right adjustment of internal rela
tions to external relations.
After all, why should Marathons be 
run anyway except for the glorious and 
sufficient purpose of announcing in the 
Athenian market-place the victory at 
Marathon over the Persians? How ut
terly purposeless is today this terribly 
taxing race, which must for many a 
participant result in disease and in 
shortened existence.Scientific AmeriBOOKS ADDED TO LIBRARY

The Harvard Advocate in a re
cent number gave proof that it pays 
even for colleges like Harvard and 
Yale to advertise, and that success 
on the football field has a great bear
ing on the number of students who 
enroll in the university the year fol
lowing. When Harvard wins from 
Yale at football Harvards enroll
ment of students in the entering class 
the following year jumps above the 
previous year, and when Yale wins 
there is a noticeable slump in the fig
ures. When the score of the annual 
classic football game is a tie the fig
ures are normal.

Dr. George W. Ehler, the Wiscon
sin director, is an ardent advocate of 
the old football rules. While in Phila
delphia on a recent visit he attended 
a meeting of 15 of the smaller schools 
of Pennsylvania, whose representa
tives were all of the opinion that the 
changes were a step backward. As 
a result of this stand, Dr. Ehler 
thinks that if the conference refuses 
to adopt the new rules it will be 
backed by most of the smaller col
lege teams in the country.
STAGG AGAINST WEST BREAK
ING WITH EAST.
Famed Chicago Coach Cjiticizes 
Football Ruling of the Confejence.
Dr. Alonzo A. Stagg, director of 
physical education at the University 
of Chicago, is not at all in sympathy 
with the recent action of the confer
ence committee in appointing a spec
ial committee on football rules for 
the conference teams. He has been 
in the South since last December re
covering from a protracted illness and 
was unable to be present in Chicago 
when the conference reorganized and 
pushed through the football legisla
tion.
In an interview with the New York 
Sun Dr. Stagg said:
I do not think that the resolution 
is a good move, and it is absurd that 
one little section of the country should 
have separate rules. Football is be
coming the national intercolle
giate game and this move 
would prevent games with any 
teams outside of this section. While 
this is bad, it is not a serious objec
tion in itself. The new rules as adopt
ed by the rules committee will not 
hurt the game in the least and will not 
bring back the old smashing tactics. 
I think that the game will be more 
open next season, and it will look the 
same to the spectator. There is not 
a unanimous feeling that the rules 
are a backward step. If there were 
this unanimous feeling then the con
ference would be justified in its action 
in case the rules committee would not 
then revise the rules.
He also said that he was thoroughly 
in agreement with the action in regard 
to summer baseball. His feelings 
against professional baseball have not 
changed in the slightest and he is still 
opposed to it.

The University of Missouri has a 
good quarter miler in Capt. Bermond, 
who is stepping the distance in 50 
seconds. A great race is expected on 
Saturday when the Missourian meets 
Sanders of Illinois in the dual meet. 
Sanders is the man who took the 
measure of Ira Davenport, Chicagos 
great runner.
Bose, Morrison, Robinson and Ham
ilton are the men who will carry the 
colors of Indiana University in the 
two mile relay at Philadelphia. Bose 
and Hamilton are the best men of this

Warren Sargent, star high jumper 
of the University of Michigan track 
squad, may be forced to remain out 
of the Syracuse dual meet owing to 
spike wounds in the right knee. The 
injury was self-inflicted and was sus

shoe came in contact with his right 
knee in leaping over the stick in prac
tice.

The Honorable, Members of the Pittsburgh Council:
As a student in the Carnegie Institute of Technology I earnestly desire 
to see the passage of the ordinance authorizing the new Morewood Avenue

The Economics Department at the 
University of Cincinnati has recently 
completed a study of the economic 
position of the families of the Uni
versity students. The families aver
aged five persons each. 5.4 per cent, 
had an income of $7,500 or over, 18 
per cent, reported between $7,500 and 
$2,500, while 75 per cent, reported less 
than $2,500, which included 35 per 
cent, with incomes less than $1,500 
per year. 67 per cent of the men 
work during the summer, while 59 
per cent work during the school year.
At Nebraska University the ex
pense of formal dances is estimated 
to be $6,000 a year. Of this $2,000 
comes from the formals given annual
ly by the sororities. These estimates 
do not include expensive gowns, 
flowers, etc., nor for the All-Univer
sity formals, which further increase 
the estimate to $15,000.
Six hundred students at the Uni
versity of Minnesota failed in the 
mid-year examinations. Of these 128 
were dropped from the rolls. Ninetyfour were from the College of Arts 
and Science.

CAPT. A. S. HENDERSON SPEAKS 
BEFORE MENS LEAGUE.
Capt. Henderson, Superintendent 
of the Carnegie Camp spoke last 
Thursday night, the 9th, before the 
Mens League of the Christ M. E. 
church of this city, on the subject 
of the dangers of the sea and the 
Titanic disaster. Captain Henderson, 
in view of his varied experience at 
sea, was peculiarly fitted to give a 
very interesting talk to the large audi
ence which heard him. His acquaint
anceship with the officers and captain 
of the Titanic and his many refer
ences to the doomed ship gave added 
interest to his talk.

APPLIED SCIENCE CLUB ROOM
This week should be balance of fur
niture arrive, the furnishing of the 
Applied Science Club room will be 
about complete, as far as this years 
committee is concerned.
Considerable credit is due the stu
dent body for its liberal response to 
the call for contributions to cover 
expense of same.
Thanks is due all of the heads of 
the departments and Mr. Orbin, who 
have contributed so liberally, particu
larly to Professors James and Wurts, 
who each contributed $10.
Also to the Schools who have given 
$250 to same. It is to be hoped that 
the students will take pride in 
their club room to the extent of 
avoiding any roughhousing that will 
tend to damage furniture.

A COLLEGE FARM.
A novel idea has recently been 
originated by President Hibbon of 
Princeton University to enable stu
dents there to earn their way through 
college. The plan embraces the es
tablishment of what is called the 
Princeton University Farm, where 
students who desire it may obtain 
work. Ploughing began last week. 
There will be steady work all sum
mer, and it is calculated that stu
dents will be able to earn two dollars 
per day. The land will be tilled on a 
socialistic, democratic basis, the la
borer obtaining the entire product of 
his toil.
The tract at present is ten acres in 
extent, but it will be increased as rap
idly as students apply for work. The 
soil will be devoted to truck farming, 
and the crop will be sold to the col
lege commons and to the various 
Princeton eating clubs. The idea has 
been adopted to rid Princeton of the 
name of being a home for the sons 
of rich men.
How about a school of Agriculture 
at Camp Louise Carnegie? 750 acres 
will make good ploughing.

patrick expects to run his half in 1

For the four mile relay Penn has 
Madeira, Levering and McCurdy, each 
capable of about 4:30. With another 
man to be picked it is doubtful wheth

will be able to offset the lead that 
Haimbaugh and Hanavan insure for 
Michigan in their relays.

ITEMS OF GENERAL INTEREST
President Richmond of Union Col
lege has announced that a pageant 
will be held on the college campus 
the latter part of May to commemo
rate the 25th anniversary of the ob
taining of a charter by the city of 
Schenectady. The Union students 
are to participate in the portrayal. 
About two hundred and fifty persons 
will depict incidents of early life in 
Schenectady, such as Indian dances, 
the Schnectady massacre, and Dr. 
Nott, president of Union from 1804, 
to 1866, riding in his three-wheel 
chariot, which he invented and which 
has been preserved by the college.
The various Greek letter fraternitier of America have 300,000 members 
today in the colleges and universities 
of the land. They are all derived 
from a secret fraternity, organized 
in 1750 by the students of William 
and Mary College at Williamsburg, 
Va., and called the Flat Hat Club. 
/Vmong the members of the F. H. C. 
were St. George Tucker, Thomas 
Jefferson and Edmund Randolph.
The University of Minnesota has 
refused to grant Ms to the mem
bers of the football team because of 
some damage done to the North
western train which took them to 
the Wisconsin game. The railroad 
company submitted a bill for dam
ages amounting to $48 and the letters 
will not be granted until some one 
admits his guilt and the debt is paid.
According to an exchange, thirteen 
leading universities of the Middle 
West have 34,000 students, 3,000 pro
fessors and instructors, and spend 
$11,000,000 a year, and thirteen lead
ing universities in the East have 34,
000 students, 4,000 in the teaching 
force and dispense $13,000,000. West
ern universities have four times as 
many students as they had twenty 
years ago.

THE TARTAN
'WHATS WHAT AND HOWI
We cannot suppress information 
any longer. It is said that truth 
crushed to earth will rise again, but 
near-truth never gets crushed; its foot 
work is perfect and it can shin up a 
tree and disappear with far greater 
agility than a lie trained to the min
ute. As there is a stock of both 
brands accumulating in the Tartans 
refrigerator, the time seems to have 
arrived when at least a few of the 
anxious inquirers who are congested 
with acute curiosity must be put out 
of their misery.
Unidentified information, without 
authentic parentage, has been clutter
ing the mental shelves of the staff 
for some weeks and it is proposed 
here to offer these remnants, marked 
down regardless of cost, trusting that 
choice bits here and there may fit 
these naked and shivering inquiries.
Those who have sleepless problems 
squirming about in their inner con
sciousness and kicking larger ragged 
holes in their composure, are invited 
to pour out their loads of interroga
tion points and secure immediate re
lief. Nows the time to subscribe. We 
can offer no advice on mustache fer
tilizers, or on the tender etiquette of 
moonlight wanderings, but are willing 
to tackle almost anything else and to 
tackle low.
The information is not guaranteed 
strictly fresh, and where accuracy 
conflicts with poetic lie-sense, accur
acy will be severely handicapped, to 
say the least. Reginald Tiredout, 
Plebe, is first at the bat, with his 
anxiety about the Morewood avenue 
extension legend. Yes, Reggie, there 
was a dear little rumor that Morewood avenue was to be coaxed over 
past the Science Building, that came 
to us something like a year ago, but 
it was kidnaped and held for ransom 
(ransom is the polite term, you know) 
by parties unknown.
There is a gum shoe campaign or
ganizing for its rescue, but the price 
of rubber soles is agonizing.
No, my boy, there is scarcely any 
foundation for the hope that the 
schools will install a moving sidewalk 
even if the Morewood dream is real
ized.
Nor do we think there will be a 
trap door over the g}rm to short cir
cuit reluctant plebes into physical sal
vation. That would be real mean.
F. Pass, wants to know what in 
thunder is Bohemianism? to use his 
own sparkling phraseology.
W e offer the following modest defi
nition :
Bohemianism is the beau art of be
ing real devilish on twenty-five cents 
per week.
It is also one solution of the fas
cinating problem of existence with
out labor, except that involved in the ! 
subjugation and subsequent operation | 
of a pipe, which cannot, by any I 
stretch of the imagination, be classed I 
as one of the beaux arts.
Home Run Hickey tearfully inquires 
if the putative stadium is not wearing 
its stays too tight.
Yes, Homie, the mirage, poetically 
yclept stadium is rapidly approaching
zero as its limit, but then theres the 
dirt and it must be deposited some
where. They have not yet thought 
of the tennis courts.
Baseball operations, on this dimin
ishing arena may be slightly re
stricted, but they will at least be or
nate and picturesque.
The center fielder may be placed on 
the gym bridge (more or less hypo
thetical) with an aeroplane and a but
terfly net, whence he may dart about 
after vagrant flies like awell let us 
say swallow. The right and left field
ers will be the goats and flit about 
among the superannuated kitchen 
maidens and deceased house pets on 
the fragrant slopes.
The football field may somewhat 
overlap the grandstand, and a run 
around the end may at times cause 
temporary discomfort to the audience, 
but the subsequent exhilaration of 
comparing spike marks and fractures 
will partly compensate for that, and 
there will always be the intoxicating 
possibility of a fatality to ones moth
er-in-law, so that it will doubtless be
come the popular place to escort that 
inadvertent relative. Does this ex
planation relieve your pain any, 
Homie? Clarence Hybrow is solici
tous about the new degrees. No, 
Clarence the report that the janitors 
will receive the degree of M. E. (Mas
ter of Elevators), is absolutely with
out foundation, sub-basement or 
basement. You need not commit harikari yet.

THE PERFECT COLLEGE YELL.
Authorities hold that the perfect 
yell is based on the bray of the 
Missouri mule alternating with the 
notes of the game rooster, modified 
by the trumpet of the auto horn. 
War whoops and the sound of a 
couple of kegs of nails falling down 
the cellar steps furnish an impres
sive cresendo, while the most effec
tive farewell is a cross between the 
song of a dying calf and a lost soul. 
These finer shadings express the 
deeper emotions turned loose on a 
civilized country.
Add to these the moans of a crack
ed bass viol and the nocturnal notes 
of a love-sick tom-cat, and we think 
the yell will be a piece of art.Balti

CARNEGIE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY : : :
T
^HE Carnegie Institute of Technology consists of four 
separate schools, each with its own faculty, buildings 
and student body. The courses of instruction 
offered in these four schools differ widely.
School of Applied ScienceOffers courses in chemical, 
civil, electrical, commercial, mechanical, metallurgical, 
mining and sanitary engineering.
School of Applied DesignOffers courses in architecture, 
interior decoration, illustration and painting, open to both 
men and women.
School of Applied IndustjiesOffers industrial courses in 
machine construction, building construction, and elec
trical equipment and installation. Short courses are offered 
in the various trades for applicants with experience. A 
new course to equip men as teachers in manual training 
and in trade school work is also offered. The increasing 
demand for such men provides an attractive field for the 
progressive young mechanic and the public school teacher
Majgajet Mojjison Cajnegie SchoolFor women only. 
Offers courses in household economics, secretarial work, 
dressmaking, and costume illustration and design. Be
cause of the demand for trained teachers, graduate courses 
are offered for those who wish to prepare for the many 
positions now open for women in these newer lines of work.
Night CoujsesThe four schools offer night courses in 
practically all of the above subjects to provide educational 
opportunities for those who are at work during the day.
