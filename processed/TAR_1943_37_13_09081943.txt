Famous Danish Playwright Chosen 
As Instructor For Tech Dramats
Mr. Kai Olaf Heiberg-Jurgensen, 
newest addition to the Drama 
School faculty, was born in Den
mark where his grandparents sev
eral greats back had been quite 
prominent in the theatre. Johan Hei
berg, from whom Mr. Jurgensen in
herited a theatrical background as 
well as part of his name, was a wellknown Danish playwright and man
ager of the Royal Theatre in Copen
hagen. His grandmother, Johanna 
Heiberg, was the Katherine Cornell 
of Denmark in her day and is still 
talked of by Danish theatre-goers.
MrJurgensen was sixteen when 
his father died, so he came to the 
United States to live with an aunt 
and uncle in Maissoula, Montana. 
During the year that he spent in
Seven Departments Receive 
2 New Profs, 16 Instructors
This week the Tech faculty has been increased by eighteen new ap
pointments. Most of the new faculty members are young men, and two in
structors, Mr. Edward Fireman and Mr. Harold Schweinler, are former 
Tech students. Your reporter visited the various departments to which 
the new appointees had been assigned, and secured a cross section of the 
new instructors.
New in the Physics department is Edward L. Fireman, one of our 
youngest instructors. Mr. Fireman began at Carnegie in 1939, majoring in 
mathematics and minoring in Physics. While attending school, he tried 
his hand teaching mathematics as a part-time job. Tech was short of 
Physics teachers, however, and so Mr. Fireman took over the job. While 
teaching he also plans to work for advanced degrees in Mathematics and 
Physics, and expects to receive an advanced degree in Mathematics in the 
near future. In answer to my questions concerning his feelings as a teacher 
Mr. Fireman answered:
Its a lot easier to give quizzes than it is to take them yourself. I have 
a lot of fun with my pupils and its a pleasure teaching them.
Besides going out for advanced degrees and teaching, he is engaged in 
National Defense Research Work, which is a vital war project. Mr. Fire
man is also a member of Phi Kappa Phi, a national scholastic honorary,
and Sigma Psi, a scientific honoraryDr. Warner Acts As 
Chairman At 106th 
Meeting of A.C.S.
This is another war meeting. The 
106th gathering of the American 
Chemical Society meets in Pitts
burgh for the fifth time. Originally, 
plans called for this meeting to be 
held in Minneapolis, but they had 
to be abandoned because of inadehigh school in Montana, he acquired 
a new interest in the theatre when 
a dramatics teacher who wanted to 
do a Chekov play asked him to play 
a Russian character because his 
Danish-accented English made it 
easy for him to simulate a Rus
sian accent. He found the theatre a 
fascinating compelling force and 
has been working with it ever since. 
After a year at the Maissoula high 
school, he went to the University of 
Montana where he did more theatre 
work and got his A. B. in English 
Literature in 1937. The same year 
he went back to Europe to study for 
a yearat least that was his plan. 
He had taken out first papers for 
citizenship and was told that he 
continued on page 3
quate facilities. Catalyst for War 
Chemistry, the theme, has been the 
guiding light for all plans. A gen
eral de-emphasis of entertainment 
features has been necessary, but a 
maximum opportunity for the dis
cussion and exchange of technical 
information has been provided. The 
arrangements have been made, not 
at the expense of professional duties, 
but by overtime work on the part of 
the Pittsburgh section.
Dr. J. C. Warner, head of our 
Chemistry Department, is the Gen
eral chairman of the meeting, with
D. SMcKinney, also from this de
partment, a committee chairman in 
charge of personnel. The Pittsburgh 
section of the A. C. S. has, since 
1943, been progressing rapidly. The 
group is a direct outgrowth of the 
Engineers Society of Western Penn
sylvania. The Pittsburgh Section 
continued on page 4
for the completion of original work 
in science. Besides Mr. Fireman, 
other newly appointed instructors 
i nthe Physics department are Sam
uel Foner, Mr. Robert Heine-Geldern, Mr. Chester Leaman and Mr. 
Harold Schweinler.
As a new instructor in psychology 
and education, Tech has secured 
Mrs. Marion H -Mowatt. Her un
dergraduate work was done at 
Swarthmore. She did graduate 
work at Columbia and received her 
Ph. D. at Bryn Mawr. Mrs. Mowatt 
taught psychology at Wilson in 
Chambersburg, Pa., and was head 
of the testing department for all 
public schools at Mount Lebanon . 
Township. Her work included a 
course at the psychological clinic at 
the University of Pittsburgh, where 
she worked hand in hand with lead
ing psychiatrists. Mrs. Mowatt is 
happy at Tech, likes the students 
and thinks theyll be very pleasant 
to work with. So far Mrs. Mowatt 
knows her way around in only three 
buildings, Maggie Murph, Industries 
Hall, and the Grill; otherwise she is 
completely lost on campus.
Going over to Machinery Hall, I 
encountered Mr. John A. McIntyre, 
newly appointed instructor in the 
Electrical Engineering department. 
Mr. McIntyre attended the Univer
sity of Washington and graduated 
last spring with a Bachelor of Sci
ence degree.
Last summer he worked at the 
Westinghouse research laboratories 
and returned this summer, working 
there until acquiring his new posi
tion at Tech. Here since August, 
Mr. McIntyre claims that hes been 
as busy as the dickens. Mr. Mc
Intyre refused to comment on the 
new women students at Tech; in
stead he said he would leave that to 
the undergraduate students. Al
though he is teaching Physics in
stead of Electrical Engineering to 
Army students, he hopes to teach 
those same men Electrical Engi
neering when they are far enough 
advanced in their work to study 
electrical subjects. Other instructors 
in Electrical Engineering are Mr.

2THE CARNEGIE TARTANWEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 8, 1943
dUo>iX A'unoUaiA.
For Freshmen Only/
With our first issue of this semester we want to give our welcome to 
the new freshmen who have just entered Tech, as well as those who entered 
in the early part of August. We sincerely hope that you will be happy and 
successful herein fact wed like to give you a few words of advice that 
we think might help. We know, of course, that you have been handed 
many unsought words of wisdom by all who suspected that you were 
about to enter college, but we think that we can add something different to 
that same old story.
The most important thing a freshman can bring to college with him is 
on objective point of view. Think things out for yourself. Decide exactly 
what is the most important thing you want to get from your three or four 
years at Carnegie Tech, and then set out to accomplish your aim. For some 
people this is easy  they are the ones who are seriously interested in 
some profession, and they neednt be told to buckle down and work while 
in school, because they know thats what theyre here for. For the rest, the 
choice is not so easy. They may just be marking time before coming to a 
decision about their lifes work, or until theyre eighteen, or until they get 
married. It is for these people that we say it is important to think about 
what they really want most in school. Its foolish, as well as nearly im
possible for an individual to go out for five or six activities, become a 
bright light in the social world (or whats left of it), and try to make high 
grades at the same time.
What Do You Want Most?
There are many sports to choose from, many publications to work on, 
lots of other things like Glee Club or the YMCA that can be fun to belong 
to, but dont try them all. Of course, we dont mean for you to be too 
narrow in your choice of activities at Tech, for we think that your life 
should have variety, but we would like to warn you against taking on too 
many things at firstWe want you to join in activities (the TARTAN can 
always use reporters!) but we think you should look over the various forms 
of activity carlfully before you decide which one or two you want to work 
on. And then really work at it  much of the value of a college is that its 
extracurricular work is wonderful training in how to get along with people, 
and how to handle responsibilities.
One last thought  to enjoy any of the advantages of college you have 
to stay in school. Tech is noted for the fact that if your grades are poor 
at the beginning, you might as well give up, because they seldom come up. 
Teachers love to look up your past record <for reference, so make it your 
business to fool em  get the best possible grades you can while you are a 
freshman, and youll find it easier to get along from then on.
Letters To The Editor
Dear Editor:
I beg to inform you that I deep
ly resent the misspelling of my 
name in last weeks TARTAN. Podbielniak is spelled with an ie, 
not an ei! It is indeed surprising 
to me that no one on the supposed
ly intelligent TARTAN staff has 
heard of Podbielniak, the inventor 
of the Podbielniak process for con
verting ashes to ashes and dust to 
dust, as well as the man who first 
introduced the use of rubber roads 
and concrete automobile tires. I am 
hoping for a printed admission of 
your error in the near future.
Respectfully,
Q (his mark)
J. Podbielniak.
P. SIf you would like a copy of 
my new book entitled How to Make 
Synthetic Rubber from Natural 
Rubber, please send six Coca-Cola 
bottle-caps (with full bottles at
tached) and $541.27 in stamps or

Head of Met. Dept. 
To Lecture In Brazil
DrRobert F. Mehl, head of the 
department of Metallurgy and di
rector of the Metals Research lab
oratory, will leave the Carnegie 
campus about the fifteenth of Oc
tober to go to Brazil in the interest 
of that countrys industrial power. 
He will deliver a series of lectures 
on the metallurgy of iron and steel 
at the Escola Politecnica at San 
Paulo, located about two hundred 
miles from Rio de Janeiro. These 
lectures will be designed to assist 
the local industries in their work 
with iron and steel.
The trip is being made at the re
quest of the Brazilian government 
through the office of the Coordinator 
of InteK-American Affairs, Mr. Nel
son Rockefeller. Dr. Mehl will not 
confine his lectures to San Paulo, 
but will travel elsewhere in Brazil 
and also in other South American 
countries.
His lectures at the Escola will be 
attended by a selected group of 
metallurgical students, and also by 
a group of about thirty industrial
ists in San Paulo. San Paulo is the 
great industrial city of South Amer
ica, and is often called the Pitts
burgh of South America. The Es
cola Politecnica is probably the out
standing engineering school in Bra
zil. Upon request, Dr. Mehl is taking 
with him bibliofilm of the courses in 
metallurgy at Tech in order to aid 
the Escola in organizing a metal
lurgy curriculum. __________
Robert Gill Directs Winter 
Season, Starting Oct. 1
Robert Gill who has been direct
ing the first summer season in the 
nine-year history of the Pittsburgh 
Playhouse, has been chosen by the 
executive board of the Playhouse to 
serve as director this coming win
ter, according to an announcement 
made by Thomas A. Robinson, presi
dent of the board.
Mr. Gill, who, incidentally, taught 
at Techs Drama School last year, 
received his B.A. degree here in 
1933. Since then he has acted and 
directed with the Pittsburgh Play
house, announced for WCAE and 
WCAU, and worked as stage direct
or for the Pittsburgh Opera Society. 
He was also granted a Reckefeller 
Fellowship at the Cleveland Play
house by the National Theater Con
ference.
After the summer season is over, 
he will open the 10th winter season 
with a play to be announced shortly.
The proposed trip is expected to 
last about three months. JDuring 
this time Dr. Mehl plans to fly to 
other parts of South America, par
ticularly Peru, where he will visit 
the university from which one of 
Techs metallurgical students, Al
berto Chipoco, came. Dr. Mehl will 
leave Miami, Florida by plane, fly 
to Panama, then down the West 
Coast to South America, cross the 
Andes at Bolivia, and arrive in Rio 
de Janeiro about five days after his 
departure from Miami.

wouldnt need return papers to re
enter the country. The hell you 
wont! said the American consul 
in Denmark a year later when he 
was ready to come back. So Mr.
Jurgensen had to emigrate again 
which took another year.
While he was in Denmark, he was 
an apprentice at the Royal Theatre 
in Copenhagen where he studied 
voice and acting technique under 
prominent Danish actors, and on one 
occasion he even did some work 
with the Monte Carlo Ballet which 
was in Europe then. During these 
years in Europe he worked with the 
Copenhagen Student Theatre acting, 
directing, and doing lighting. They 
took Ibsens Brand on tour with Mr. 
Jurgensen directing the play and 
acting in it. In 1939 he returned to 
New York and to the girl from Mon
tana.
Mr. and Mrs. Jurgensen spent the 
next two years in New York saving 
up money to go to Chapel Hill for 
graduate work. They bought an old 
car, piled all their stuff in it includ
ing the cat and went to North Car
olina where Mr. Jurgensen had a 
Rockefeller Fellowship and was as
sistant to Professor Frederick Koch, 
head of the Drama Department. 
Here he wrote five plays about Dan
ish life and was awarded the Roland 
Holt Cup for excellence in playwriting. His own plays and his own 
translation of Peer Gynt were pro
duced by the Carolina Playmakers. 
He also did some experimental 
work in combining modern dance
From the clean new notebook of 
a returned native:
One of the more charming links 
between home and school is that 
street car token one finds in an odd 
pocket during the summer and care
fully saves to use on his first trol
ley ride in Pittsburgh.
When I was a freshman I cherish
ed the thing and had it safely wrap
ped in cotton wadding (theoretical
ly speaking) for the sentimental 
hour when I should use it again to 
bring me to Tech. This year, though, 
when I saw it in July I forgot it and 
when I saw it in August I was too 
embarrassed to really attach much 
emotion to it. There I was, with 
fifty small valises and four or five 
hat boxes, climbing into Car 69, 
Squirrel Hill bound. At the proper 
moment the trolley lurched and my 
pocketbook crawled all over the 
floor, getting both under peoples 
feet'and in peoples hair . Among
with the spoken word and putting 
some of Andersens fairy tales in 
opera form.
Mr. Jurgensen is a rather seriouslooking young man who wears dark 
horn-rimmed glasses in class. He has 
a friendly smile which crinkles his 
whole face and punctuates his con
versation. Because he intended to 
be a great playwright some day, he 
started a collection of pipes so that 
he could get a proper playwright 
picture taken with a pipe. But he 
is too nervous to keep a pipe going so 
he smokes cigarettes. Among his 
books he has a copy of Winterset in 
which Maxwell Anderson wrote 
some lines after Mr. Jurgensen told 
the author that he thought Winterset was one of the greatest plays in 
the English language since Shakes
peare. He is very fond of animals 
and likes to hike in the country with 
a dog (his present pet peeve is that 
Pittsburgh apartment houses wont 
tolerate animals). His favorite play
wright is, of course, Ibsen.

breathed very heavily, and so, I ar

I dont know about you and you

to mass them under one title, The

individual and I understand they 
arent all engineers, but its easier 
that way.
I also like the swing the boys ap

from the Beanery without finding 
herself in peculiar situations like 
court martials. All you do, of 
course, is ask the nearest soldier.
One personal puzzler, though, is 
the matter of officers. I see much

others in very picturesque arm

Committee Proposes 
Assembly Programs 
With Student Appeal
At last plans, good plans, are un
der way to improve Carnegies num
ber one borethe student assembly 
programs. The multitude of stu
dents who stayed away from former 
assemblies in droves ought to have a 
changed attitude when the new pro
grams are publicized. As yet the 
plans are a bit indefinite, but one 
main objective has been agreed 
upon by the committeeto sched
ule light entertainment programs 
which will have definite student ap
peal.
The committee itself, consisting of 
faculty members and students, is a 
bit novel. Dr. Schultz and Profes
sor Gregg are the faculty members, 
and John Lindberg and Dorothy 
Schadel represent the students. One 
point has been agreed upon by all 
to eliminate dull, heavy speakers.
As to what has been definitely 
planned, the opening program, 
scheduled for September 14, will 
consist of movies. By the time the 
reader sees this article John Lind
berg will have selected the motion 
pictures which he believes will be 
of greatest interest to the student 
body. Another idea of the commit
tee is to have a Tech Talent Show. 
This show will probably take place 
some time in October, and it is ex
pected that both the music and dra
ma departments will cooperate. On 
October 6 there will be another 
movie program for all students who 
are not scheduled to take traditions 
exams. As often as possible, the 
committee plans to adhere to the 
former system of an assembly pro
gram every other week.

recognizes outstanding service to 
chemistry each year by an award. 
It is not necessarily restricted to the 
society, but in most cases the re
cipients have been members. In 
1941 Webster N. Jones, director of 
the College of Engineering, receiv
ed the award, which is made about 
six months after the meeting, usual
ly in February.
Realizing that gatherings will 
cause an extra burden to transporta
tion facilities ,it was nevertheless 
felt that the importance of this 
meeting justifies holding it. It is the 
proud boast of the society that the 
time, as always, will be devoted to 
work, not play. In general the pur
pose of the meeting is three-fold. 
First a forum is provided for discus
sion of pertinent subjects. The most 
important of these will be food, rub
ber, coal, petroleum, and technical 
man-power. Secondly, the exchange 
of information and the report of pro
gress in the field. Publicity of many 
of these facts is impossible, due to 
war time restrictions. Although this 
tends to kill public appeal it is vital 
that this be accomplishedAnd fin
ally it enables University and In
dustrial men to have informal dis
cussions where publication would 
be impossible.

All Out For Third 
War Loan Drive!
On Wednesday, September 9, the 
Third War Loan Drive of this War 
will be opened with a nation-wide 
radio address by President Roose
velt. This campaign, by far the big
gest ever to be undertaken in the 
history of this country, has as its 
goal the astronomical sum of fifteen 
billion dollars. Needless to say, this 
sum will require a supreme effort on 
the part of every American, for the 
attainment of $15,000,000,000 puts 
on every man, woman and child the 
share of $115 in addition to their 
pledges made in former drives.
Of course not every person can 
be expected to contribute such an 
amount, and college students es
pecially, will not will be able to sac
rifice a sum over a hundred dollars. 
But this should not prevent us from 
doing our utmost, for quarters and 
dollars are just as important for the 
success of the campaign. All of us, 
young or old, rich or poor, will have 
to pitch in. We must remember that 
it is not a duty, but a privilege to 
contribute toward our war effort. 
Only in a democracy ,where each 
citizen shares equal responsibility 
for the actions of his government, is 
everyone in any position able to 
help win his countrys war. Es
pecially, will not be able to sacwhich not one of us is without a rel
ative or friend in the services this 
possibility to help is a thing to be 
cherished.
So do without that extra pack of 
cigarettes, skip that mid-week 
movie or the daily piece of candy, 
and give your dimes and quarters to 
your country. BACK THE AT
TACK WITH WAR BONDS!

Girls Needed For Work At

The large number of entering stu

an unusually large load on the Inn

are great enough to take care of in
creased business, a serious shortage 
of help has developed.
For this reason, the girls in school 
have been called upon to assist at 
these eating places at noon if theyhave two hour lunch periods. The 
pay will be either sixty cents lunch 
credit or forty cents an hour. All 
those interested should see Miss

Entries for Intramural Touch foot
ball competition are due today in the 
Intramural Office. Games will begin 
at five-twenty Monday through Fri
day. The competition will be entire
ly between civilian teams, due to the 
fact that it is impossible to find time 
in which to schedule games and 
leagues wh:|bh will incfude Army 
teams. .The schedule will probably 
be arranged on a one league basis, al
though final decision on that score 
will depend on the number of entries 
received from the fraternities, dormi

the first game this season weighing 
about 200 pounds, the heaviest man 
on the team this year. He is playing 
his eighth year at the right tackle 
position, having played four years 
in High School at Lima, Ohio. One 
of the high spots in his life occurred

WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 8, 1943THE CARNEGIE TARTAN7
Company B Plans Touch Football
By Mike
In face of the War Department or
der preventing soldiers from taking 
part in inter-collegiate sports, the 
Company B boys decided they would 
play football anyway. That the men 
were eager for some sort of com
petitive football was obvious when 
all five platoons formed teams and 
announced that they were ready.
The victorious 2nd (Softball 
Champs) started the ball rolling 
with their 17 man squad. They faced 
a powerful team from the 4th pla
toon and the game was close all the 
way. The B 4s had plenty of reserve 
power and used it freely. However, 
the B2s sparked by Charles Mooney 
scored and converted the extra point 
to win 7-0. Although there were no 
serious injuries the play on both 
teams was rugged but promising. 
The backs on both teams were fast 
and the B 4 line was strengthened 
by Larson and Smith.
The next game saw the B 1 team 
face the defeated B 4s. After 50 
minutes of play the score was 0-0. 
Little Ed Selke kept riding the B ls 
to score but Hal Leocks B 4s held. 
Kennedy, Topping and Puppak gave 
the 1st platoon driving punch, but 
the sustained drive was lacking.
The third playing day saw the B 2 
team come back to the bowl to play 
an untried B 5 team. The Lebanon 
Valley Flash, Mat Maley and his 
running mate Bob Baldwin scored 
on the B 2s early to lead 6-0. The 
failure to convert counted heavily 
as the game rolled into the third 
quarter. Cowboy Joyce and Billy 
DeVos, running the team i n 
Mooneys absence, opened up a run
ning and passing attack that forced 
a touchdown in straight plays. With 
the score tied at 6-6, B 2 missed its 
oportunity and the game ended in 
a tie.
The next game saw the B 4s and 
the B 5s engage in a passing duelRed Reini was the key to the

fourth platoons overhead attack and 
though B 5s Malley-Baldwin com
bination clicked, the fourth won its 
first game to the tune of a 6-0 score. 
Smitty, playing with his roommate 
Stonewall Larson, again shone on 
the line for the winning team.
The fifth game in the league saw 
the league leading B 2 team toppled 
by a fighting first platoon squad. The 
Kennedy captained B ls scored 12 
points while blanking their oponents. Selke again used his 140 
pounds to good advantage with end 
runs and flat passes. His interfer
ence was good and the running 
counted heavily in the score.
The only team untried and un
tested is the B-3 aggregation. Led by 
Quarterback Eimolf and with Man 
Mountain Beck in the line, the third 
expects to make it hot for the op
position. In scrimmage they looked 
extremely well, and uncorked sev
eral good running plays. We expect 
the B-3s to depend on power plays 
for their ground gainers.
BULLETIN BOARD
Because of the extreme shortage of 
labor, it is necessary for the time be
ing to limit the service hours at the 
Carnegie Grill to: 7-9, breakfast; 11-2, 
lunch; and 5-8 p. m., dinner. This ac
tion is effective Thursday, September 
9.
This issue is being given to mem
bers of the ASTP with the compli
ments of the TARTANHowever, 
as these men pay no Activities Fee, 
there will be a subscription charge 
of $1 for the remaining issues of 
the semester. An ASTP representa
tives will contact the soldiers some
time in the immediate future for or
ders.
Anyone who was in school this 
summer and has changed his home ad
dress or Pittsburgh address should let 
the Registrar have his new address 
and phone number immediately. Oth
erwise it will appear incorrectly in 
the Student Directory.

Tech is going to have a football 
team after all, thanks to Mugsy 
Skladany and his two coaching as
sistants, A1 Irwin and Buck Ewing.
Mugsy has had a great football 
careerHe played varsity football at 
Pitt from 1931 to 1933. In 1933 he 
was chosen as All-American end and 
played in the East-West game in San 
Francisco. In 1934, Mugsy.. played 
in the College All-Stars game in 
Chicago. After enjoying temporary 
retirement from football, he start
ed coaching at Tech in 1937 and 
hes been here ever since.
Our team, according to Mugsy, 
will not be a great team, but it will 
be a good team. At present, the team 
lacks speed, so the emphasis is put 
on running exercises. We lack an 
experienced quarterback, center, 
and ends. At the present time, thirty-nine boys are out for the team. 
Ten or fifteen more candidates 
would round out the squad nicely. 
If you have football ability, can run 
fast, and would like to cover your
self with a lot of dust and maybe a 
little glory, report to the field house 
right away and sign up.
Practice starts at 5:30. The boys 
indulge in calesthenics until 5:45. 
From 5:45 to 6:00, our heroes-to-be 
practice pulling out of the line and 
generally condition their legs. They
then run plays till 6:45. The backs 
practice punting from 6:45 to 7:00 
when practice ends. The Tartans 
will have 45 to 50 running plays and 
10 to 15 passing plays this season. 
As in previous years, a single wingback formation interspersed with a 
little T formation will be used. 
The more speed the team can develope, the better the T will work.
Mugsys partial line-up, as it 
now stands, includes: halfbacks, Ir
win Brier (left-handed passer), and 
John Macintosh (transfer student 
from Bethany), fullback Joe Wilson, 
guards Dave Crump and Ben Baklarz, and tackles Cliff Mikus and 
John Lindberg, the last four being 
lettermen from last years team.
Our tentative schedule includes 
games with Bethany at home, Case 
in Cleveland, Lehigh at home, West 
Virginia at Morgantown, and Pitt at 
home. November 6 is still openindicative of our teams successes 
to come is the high spirit of the can
didates. Although practice does not 
officially start until 5:30, most of the 
boys are out practicing by 5:00 or 
5:15.
We certainly owe Mr. Skladany, 
Mr. Irwin, and Mr. Ewing a vote of 
thanks and all the support we can 
give them and the team for keeping 
football alive at Tech.

THE CARNEGIE TARTANWEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 8, 1943PLEBE BIBLE
It is the purpose of this page to 
fulfill the need for a source of infor
mation required by the incoming 
freshmen. The Plebe Bible is intend
ed primarily to acquaint the classes 
of 1946-X and 1947 with the perti
nent facts of Tech history, songs, 
cheers, etc. An adequate knowledge 
of this material, which will be tested 
by a Traditions Examination, will be 
required for all Freshmen to receive 
credit for extra-curricular activities.
History
The Carnegie Institute of Tech
nology was founded by Andrew Car
negie. The plan of the Institute was 
first proposed in 1900, a site was se
lected in 1902, and in 1905 ground 
was broken for the first buildings. 
In 1908 the first diplomas were 
awarded, and in 1912, at the fifth 
commencement, the first degrees 
were conferred.
The demands for technical educa
tion were so great that constant ex
pansion was necessary, and Mr. Car
negie not only provided five million 
dollars for buildings but also in
creased the endowment to nine mil
lions.
Publications
In addition to the information 
about Tech history, the freshmen 
should have a working knowledge 
of some facts about Carnegie pub
lications, officers, department heads, 
etc. No compilation of this can be 
complete, but certain things should 
definitely be learned.

Tech has many songs, but a few 
of them are used much more than 
others. In addition to the Alma 
Mater every freshman should know 
the trilogy, composed of Dear Old 
Tech, Skibo, and Fight for the 
Glory, and the womens song. The 
words are as follows.
ALMA MATER 
Here where spangled wildernesses 
Robed the mountains of the West, 
Where the savage strife and stresses 
Brought the settlers crimson quest, 
Land of legend glory, graces 
Gypsy tide and rolling shore 
Mid thy hilltops, Alma Mater 
Stands enthroned forevermore.
All hail Carnegie, Alma Mater 
Stand enthorned forevermore.
DEAR OLD TECH 
Dear old Tech  Carnegie Tech
Youre the best of all the schools I 
ever knewDear old Tech  Carnegie Tech,

eye,
And when Im far away from Pitts

Ill remember you TECH, till I die.
