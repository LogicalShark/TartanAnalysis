BACCALAUREATE ADDRESS 
BY DR. SCHAEFFER.
His Message Was The Value of 
Truth.
To begin this week of ceremonies, 
now drawing to a close, Dr. Nathaniel 
C. Schaeffer, State Superintendent of 
Instruction, gave his Baccalaureate ad
dress in the Lecture Hall last Sunday 
afternoon at 3:30.
Dr. Schaeffer was introduced by Di
rector A. A. Hamerschlag, who paid 
the official a high tribute for learning 
and ability in conducting the educa
tional affairs of a great common
wealth, and expressed the apprecia
tion of the whole institution in having 
him to inaugurate commencement 
week. Aside from the address of Dr. 
Schaeffer there was a short musical 
programme. The students under the 
leadership of Musical Director Mc
Dowell, sang America and our new 
Alma Mater.
Among those on the platform with 
Dr. Schaeffer and Dr. Hamerschlag, 
were Deans Clifford B. Connelly, 
Charles R.-Hewlett and John H. Leete 
and Secretary William P. Field.
Science and Truth.
Dr. Schaeffer, in his address, laid 
stress on the necessity of the gradu
ates sticking to truth in everything 
if they wished real success. The sci
entist, who is really a scientist, 
he said, seeks in his investiga
tions, the truth, and the truth alone 
and he who deviates from it or makes 
of truth a thing of barter, works with
out happiness to himself or profit to 
humanity.
In this busy work-a-day world of 
ours, said Dr. Schaeffer, too often 
do we see truth sold without hesita
tion, and for a mere pittance; men 
trade away that which should be their 
greatest inspiration and their great
est satisfaction. There is no ex
cuse, of course, for any man selling 
the truth; but there is less reason for 
the man of science, the scholar making 
researches which will and should ben
efit all, succumbing to the temptation 
and forgetting the great work for 
which they have been trained and the 
opportunities with which they have 
been blessed. Science is not politics, 
however much we may consider poli
tics as having been made a science.

Last evening at the Rittenhouse, the 
Class of 1912 danced away the cares 
of four years.
Only Faculty, Seniors and Alunini 
were present. And so the evening 
partook of the nature of a farewell 
to the Faculty and the advent of a 
long companionship with the Alumni.
Dancing began at nine with a grand 
march and reception by the patron
esses; and it continued until two this 
morning.
The music could not have been 
better. The two dances that were 
features of the evening were: The
Message of the Waltz, from His 
Highness the Chief, and the Alma 
Mater.
After dancing for several hours to 
entrancing two step and dreamy 
waltz in an endeavor to forget the 
fact that their life at Carnegie was , 
over, it was all brought back to the 
Seniors when the Home Waltz was 
played to the strains of Alma Mater. 
And the dancers left the floor with 
nothing but the mere form of Commencement exercises between them 
and the doors of Carnegie, upon their 
outward journey.
The Patronesses Were:
Mrs. Andrew Carnegie.
Mrs. A. A. Hamerschlag.
Mrs. John H. Leete.
Mrs. C. B. Connelley.
Mr. Henry Hornbostel.

DEGREES.
This commencement marks another 
step forward inasmuch as it is the 
first one at which we have granted 
degrees. The question of the value 
of a degree is, to us at this time, an 
unimportant one, one lost sight of in 
joy of the possession of power to 
grant them. They are a stamp sup
posedly placed by institutions of 
learning upon their products which 
have met successfully a certain stand
ard. If below that standard the right 
to affix those simple letters to a name 
is denied. And so it has seemed to 
us that the power to grant these insigniae is a valuable one, worth every 
effort it cost. We have long since 
had the right but not the power to 
stamp our graduates with the hall 
mark of the successful completion of 
our course of study. Now we have 
both and rejoice thereat, trusting that 
those men receiving these first de
grees will fully appreciate their added 
responsibility, and do everything in 
their power to make Carnegie degrees 
mean what degrees are supposed to 
mean, that the holder thereof is an 
educated gentleman.
On behalf of the entire studentbody the Tartan wishes to the class 
of 1912 God-speed and the best of 
success. During their four-year stay 
within the walls of their Alma Mater
they have done much to advance her 
fair name and to build up traditions. 
They now go forth into new and 
larger fields of activity, equipped for 
the struggle by their stay in Carnegie, 
and we who remain behind for yet 
another year or two wish to them the 
rapid attainment of that success which 
we know eventually to be theirs.

Is It Worth While?
To make a crib for the examination 
is surrendering to a sneaking, cow
ardly or crooked thought of ones 
self; when self confidence and steadi
ness are needed. It is a mental crutch 
which makes a moral cripple. If used 
it is dangerous. If not used it is 
damning. It is to class ones 
self with negligent and stupid 
instead of the true and self 
reliant. If discovered it brings im
measurable disappointment and suf
fering at home. Purity, honesty, un
selfishness, and love require that no 
aid be either given or received. 
Charles Dickens says, There is noth
ing so strong and safe in the emer
gencies of life as the simple truth.

OUR ENEMY, THE FLY.
The slogan, Swat the  Fly, is 
heard on every side, and that this is 
a campaign well worth the attention 
of everybody, of women especially, 
is easily shown by these few statis
tics. A pair of flies beginning in April 
may be the progenitors of nearly one 
million by June, and of two billion 
three hundred and ten million five 
hundred thousand by July.
Neat housekeepers have always rec
ognized the fly as an enemy, but only 
recently have they realized the deadly 
danger of this pest, for it has been 
found that typhoid is carried by the 
fly to us. Only during the past year 
or two have there been organized 
campaigns for the destruction of the 
flies. It is interesting to note that 
:n San Antonio, Texas, where a fly 
swatting campaign was waged last 
summer one million two hundred and 
fifty thousand flies were killed, thus 
rendering harmless one trillion germs.
Garbage is recognized on all sides 
as one of the chief breeding places for 
the flies. The women of one city, 
realizing this, agitated the draining 
and wrapping of garbage in news
papers before consigning it to the 
garbage can. A more feasible plan 
would seem to be the trapping of the 
flies after they get in the cans and 
thus destroying them altogether rath
er than chasing them to other camp:ng grounds.
The manure piles of stables are the 
best fly incubators that we know of, 
and accordingly should be carefully 
watched. Traps should be placed in 
the windows to catch the incoming 
and outgoing flies. Automobiles are 
lessening the number of stables and 
increasing the number of garages, and 
it is worth while noticing that flies 
do not like the smell of gasoline any 
better than we do.
We women have hitherto been con
tent to shut our families in screenmads prisons to wage warfare 
against the fly by means of

VALUE OF PRINCETON MEN.
What is a Princeton man worth 
when he graduates? asked President 
Hibben of Princeton the other night at 
a lecture. Answering his own question, 
he said: About $6 a week. The aver
age man could not command more than 
that amount. Why? Because he has 
not been trained for business, law, or 
medicine. Is it not therefore, a sad 
confession to make? Some say it is, and 
we have been criticised for it, but we 
can justify it. It is our endeavor to 
creat a high potential in mental pos
sibility rather than actual attainment.

4THE TARTAN
INFORMAL TEA BY M. M. C. S. 
ALUMNAE ASSOCIATION.
The Alumnae Associations infor
mal tea of May 25th was a memorable 
occasion, for among the guests were: 
Dr. John A. Brashear, Mrs. Butler 
(nee Diescher), Miss West, Miss 
Bradt and Miss Lyon and Master 
Brashear Gaston.
In the serving of the tea, Miss 
Nancy Herron, hostess, was assisted 
by Miss Lucile Sawhill, who presided 
at the tea table, and Misses Maud Car
lin, Edith Anderson, Elizabeth Kra
mer and Mary Morrow. Irises and 
paeonies were the flowers used.
In recognition of the high office 
of which he is the first holder, as well 
as in recognition of his mothers faith
ful service as its President, the As
sociation had arranged to present to 
Master Gaston a silver porringer and 
spoon, but at the eleventh hour news 
came that caused a change in the pro
gram. A silver bowl, plate and spoon 
with a card bearing the congratula
tions of Mr. and Mrs. Andrew Car
negie, to the first Tech Baby, had 
been received at the Gaston home.
Whereat, the Presentation Commit
tee, observing that Robert Brashear 
Gaston manifestly was born with a 
gold spoon in his mouth, decided that 
its duty lay in preparing an object 
lesson in thrift for this child of for
tune. He should be shown how to 
put something in his stocking 
against the rainy day. So, in behalf 
of the Association, Miss West pre
sented the tiny pink stockings which 
should make the way soft for his feet, 
and, for a nest-egg for the prudent 
savings which shall make his way 
secure, one stocking held a little bank 
bookan infant bank account. Some 
Chinese coins for the baby to play 
with were then delivered by the 
treasurer, in whose care they had 
been sent by Miss Kitty McMullen of 
Tunghiang. The small recipient be
haved as though to the manor born 
and with all smiles acknowledged the 
honor done him. Dr. Brashear was 
unanimously called for and made a 
most delightful impromptu talk.
At the brief business meeting fol
lowing the tea, a vote of thanks was 
tendered Miss Edna C. Smith, Chair
man, and her assistants, Misses Kempel and G. Hartman, for their effective 
work on the Alumnae Tartan Com
mittee.

The Alumni Association of Colum
bia University in Pittsburgh, Penna., 
has made arrangements to provide 
two annual scholarships covering one 
years free tuition in either Columbia 
College; or the Schools of Mines, En
gineering and Chemistry; or the 
School of Fine Arts (music and de
sign) for the academic year 1912-13. 
The annual value of each scholarship 
is about $250, and is intended to cover 
the tuition only and no outside ex
penses. The appointment of the schol
arship is for one year. The scholar 
having a satisfactory record at the 
end of that year will be transferred to 
a regular Columbia University Schol
arship.
Admission to the college and en
gineering schools is by examination, 
certificates not being accepted, al
though applicants now in attendance 
at some other college or university 
may be admitted to advanced stand
ing without examination. Every stu
dent interested in this scholarship may

CARNEGIE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY : : :
T
HE Carnegie Institute of Technology consists of four 
separate schools, each with its own faculty, buildings 
and student body. The courses of instruction 
offered in these four schools differ widely.
School of Applied ScienceOffers courses in chemical, 
civil, electrical, commercial, mechanical, metallurgical, 
mining and sanitary engineering.
School of Applied DesignOffers courses in architecture, 
interior decoration, illustration and painting, open to both 
men and women.
School of Applied IndustriesOffers industrial courses in 
machine construction, building construction, and elec
trical equipment and installation. Short courses are offered 
in the various trades for applicants with experience. A 
new course to equip men as teachers in manual training 
and in trade school work is also offered. The increasing 
demand for such men provides an attractive field for the 
progressive young mechanic and the public school teacher
Margaret Morrison Carnegie SchoolFor women only. 
Offers courses in household economics, secretarial work, 
dressmaking, and costume illustration and design. Be
cause of the demand for trained teachers, graduate courses 
are offered for those who wish to prepare for the many 
positions now open for women in these newer lines of work.
Night CoursesThe four schools offer night courses in 
practically all of the above subjects to provide educational 
opportunities for those who are at work during the day.

BLANKED BY CARNEGIE
Carts Gives One Hit.Score 7 to 0.
Fred Carts was in rare form Satur
day when Carnegie Tech handed West 
Virginia Wesleyan a row of goose 
eggs, the final score being 7 to 0. Cur
tis secrued the only hit that the West 
Virginia boys got, while 11 fell vic
tims to the Tech pitchers curves. The 
hard hitting of Hall, Gearhart and 
Vail was a feature of the game. Gear
hart was the star in the field, with 
Hall and Moorehead close sceonds.
West Virginia played ragged at 
times in the critical moments, and 
failed to support Trail who pitched 
very consistently.
Tech made its first run, when Hall 
drew a base on balls and scored on 
De Muths double, in the second in
ning. Two more runs were driven in 
in the fifth by Vails three-bagger. 
The game was never in doubt for 
Carts allowed only 29 men to face 
him. The score:

Once agan the Americans may be 
proudly confident that their flag will 
fly at the top of a foreifn staff in 
signifigance of the athletic championship 
of the world.
Saturday The Nations atheletes in 
the Olympic tryouts at the Harvard 
stadium that they will sally abroad once 
again with the speed, the skill and the 
strength that in each previous meet
ing of the worlds best have brought 
victory to the Stars and Stripes. In 
fact, they are speeder, more, skillful 
than any other team which has carried 
Uncle Sams colors. More new records 
must go to the credit of this record 
breaking season as the result of odays 
competition.
Abel Kiviat, the wonderful little run
ner of the Irish American A. C., pulled 
down a full second from his own 
great mark in the 1,500 metres, cover
ing the run in 3.55 4-5 and then going 
on for the mile record and stepping 
that distance in 4.15 3-5. Just a tiny one. 
fifth back of John Paul Jones worlds 
mark.
The pole vault record of 13 feet 1 inch 
made only last Saturday by Bob Gard
ner of Yale was badly beaten by Mark 
Wright of Dartmouth, who cleared the 
bar with the aid of his long bamboo at 
13 feet 2 inches.
Billy Kramer, carrying the cherry in
signia of the Long Island A. C., broke 
his own record for the 10,000 metre by 
a wide margin, running the distance in 
31.43 3-5 practically unpaced. Incident
ally he lowered every fractional mark 
from 5 1-4 to 61-4 miles.
The Olympic record of 10 4-5 sec^ 
onds for the 100 metres was equalled 
by Harry Drew, a little colored youth 
from the Springfield High School, who 
beat the famous Ralph Craig in thd 
event.
Tremendous ovations were given to 
the new record winners. The stadium 
has rarely held such an outburst of 
cheers as that which followed the fight 
of Wright (a wingless aeroplane), over 
the high bar; or that which followed 
a sprint of little Abel Kiviat across 
the finish line. The only disappointment 
of the day was provided by the great 
western jumper, Horine. A worlds 
record was expected of him if of any 
one. But the big fellow was in poor 
shape and failed to clear the bar at 6 
feet 1 inch, which is said to be seven 
inches less than a mark he made in prac
tice the other day. He was unplaced 
in the event. (From the Pittsburgh Ga
zette Times).

(Pending) Rochester, N. Y.
On opening the season with Penn 
State, we meet a team which, if not 
better, than their last years champion
ship team, will be fully as strong. 
While our team went down to defeat 
at the hands of this institution in a 
previous encounter, we left a very 
good impression. If we are assured 
a good turnout at the training camp, 
we hope to do better and return with 
a victory. It will mean a strong pres
tige for Tech, not only in athletic 
standing but also in collegiate stand
ing.
Waynesburg instead of Geneva 
will open the season at home. They 
always put up a good game but Tech 
should not have any trouble in taking 
them into camp.
Football relations will be renewed 
with W. & J. at Washington, Pa. W. 
and J. is becoming stronger each year 
and is expected to be a formidable 
contender for the state championship, 
and like Penn State will mean a very 
hard game for Tech, preliminary ar
rangements are being made for a spe
cial train to take the student body on 
the trip to Washington, Pa. This 
was done in 1910 and proved to be a 
great success, about four hundred stu
dents making the trip. Little Washing
ton will never forget that day nor 
will the Techites who made the trip.
Mt. Union will be the only Ohio 
team that we meet during the com
ing season and the results of this en
counter will decide our standing in 
the Buckeye State.
Haverford College will close the 
season at home. The Quaker institu
tion is rated with the best team in 
the east. This will be their first ap
pearance in Pittsburgh and from their 
past record a good clean fast game 
is expected. They, like Tech, have 
a Penn coach and it will be a game 
of Penn tactics throughout. Nego
tiations are pending with the Univers
ity of Rochester, for Turkey Day at 
Rochester, N. Y., and prospects for 
game look's very favorable. This will 
be a good game as well as a good trip, 
for Rochester has a population of 
about a hundred thousand, and the 
men of this institution are noted for 
their hospitality. In regard to the 
other institution we meet on the grid
iron, nothing need be said, as their 
past performances are well known to 
the Pittsburghers and Techites.
Camp Training.
In a previous edition of the Tartan, 
a call was made for candidates who 
desired to spend the early part of
September in preliminary training for 
the coming seaSor?/\>ut only a few 
men responded, jf have a hard 
schedule before us, and this prelimi
nary training is almost essential, if 
a good season is expected, the man
agement of the team has done its part 
in securing a good chef and excellent 
accommodations for the training 
camp and it is now up to the student
body and the incoming class to see
that every one turns out. We want 
everyone that thinks he can play foot
ball or that has any training at all 
and we will soon discover if you can 
play the game. The more that turn 
out the merrier we will be, and re
member boys more work for the Chef. 
Camp Louise Carnegie will be in
charge of Coaches Ramsdell, Dr. 
Marks, McCullough and Capt. Craw
ford. Weigh yourself, write your
name and address and drop it in Tar
tan box or mail to William Finkel, 
Manager, and further information will 
be sent to you in regard to the camp. 
Do it now. Come, come, let us start.
TEAM LOSES TO PITT.
Score Tied Till Eighth Inning.
Unusual activity was seen during 
the first inning of the Carnegie vs. 
Pitt Baseball game last Wednesday. 
Hall hit a home run, and Mcllveen 
followed by a hit, and subsequently 
scored on a single by Weir. Pitt also 
scored during the first inning. Noth
ing more happened until the fifth, 
when Biddle scored for Pitt. The 
score was then tied until the second 
half of the eighth. Raisig put Koenig 
on first by a boot, and Rectenwalk 
followed with a single to right, which 
De Muth booted into a three bagger. 
Koenig scored. Next Rectenwald 
scored on a fly out. In the ninth, Rec
tenwald dropped throw, thereby 
putting Wehr on first. Wehr then 
scored on Gerharts single.

Truth Pays Best.
The young man who starts out on 
his career with the determination to 
stick to the truth throughout and who 
never falters in that determination will 
find himself happy at the end in that 
great company of scientists and schol
ars who have made the world better 
because they lived in it. He who 
makes of the truth a thing of little 
moment or to be bartered for his in
dividual and temporary profit will find 
personal sorrow, if not individual con
tempt, his portion.
Truth is the grand end and aim 
and strength of institutions of tech
nology. It is a word of the intellect 
which can be defined as mature knowl
edge. It is that on which rests the 
safe progress of the human race. The 
fundamental of all pure science is 
truth, and it is well that it is so. Else 
would the advancement of the world 
be a dream, the betterment of man 
an impossibility.
The programme was finished by 
the students singing their Alma 
Mater.
On their way from the hall each 
one of the graduating class shook the 
hand of Dr. Schaeffer.
And so a week of ceremonies was 
well begun.

years by the will of Charles Herbert 
Pratt, a lawyer who died in Brook
line on May 2.
Under the will, which was filed to

$750,000 has accumulated, or at the 
end of twenty-one years after the 
testators death in any event, when 
the entire fund is to be turned to 
over the institute for the founding 
of the Pratt School of Naval Archi

The gift is conditioned upon the 
erection of a suitable building by the 
institute out of the fund. The bal

THE FLY AGAIN.
For the past few years it has been 
brought to our notice that the house 
fly is a nuisance and not complimen
tary to the housekeeper. But within 
the last few months one cannot pick 
up a newspaper or magazine that one 
is not confronted with an article about 
what a great menace the common 
house fly is. Things seem to be ap
proaching a climax when great cities 
like Washington consider it of so 
great importance that she carries on 
a fly contest, awarding a prize of 
$100 to the one killing the most flies.
As in many similar things the blame 
and fault goes back to the woman, 
both as the housekeeper and as the 
citizen. She can make a little Uto
pia of her home by seeing to it that 
there is no place in her house or on 
her premises where flies can get food 
or find breeding places. She should 
have a garbage can with a lid and 
keep the lid on, and insist upon her 
neighbor doing likewise. When she 
has done all in her own power to 
make an integral part of her city sani
tary and fly-free, then it is time to 
go to a higher power and ask it to 
improve the state of affairs in the 
rest of the city. The womans club 
can be a powerful factor at this point. 
Its members should map out a sys
tematic campaign and first of all in
terest a newspaper who will offer 
prizes for the highest number of flies 
killed. Then go to the board of health 
and they will be glad to help in any 
way, when they see that the women 
really mean business. A womans 
club certainly could not discuss a 
health, nor could they devote 
money and energy to a much 
more worthy cause. When they know 
what a menace the house fly is to 
the health of a community, why 
should they not bend all their ener
gies to eradicate it?

WHATS WHAT AND HOW.
Isnt it astonishing what you see 
when you havent a gun!
Even the Sabbath days journey 
from the street car lines to the

you know by that legendary Morewood extension, has at times its com

Did you ever attend the ceremonies 
incident to the tragic suicide of a hat 
from Junction Hollow bridge on a 
windy day? The owners exhaustive 
discussion of the performance is a 
revelation in impromptu and impas
sioned oratory.
As he leans over the rail and ad

uesque figure in gray, that looks like 
it had fallen half way through a bass 
drum, was reconciled to the situation 
and had with truly regal dignity 
wrapped his toga around the pro
tuberance.
His duties if such a heroic appar
ition has duties, seem to be, to watch 
the grass grow, to obstruct the view, 
and to herd errant canines out of the 
sacred precincts of the park.
It is an inspiring spectacle, that of 
a 250 pound representative of the law 
bully-ragging a 5 pound poodle whose 
soul doubtless yearns for the beauti
ful in Nature.
In the reign of the late lamented 
Fatty a severance of diplomatic re
lations was at one time imminent be
tween student body and the gray clad 
gardenias of the law, the line of clea
vage being the seams in Fattys of
ficial garments.
But this astute albeit voluminous 
gentleman saw a sudden and great 
light in the presence of some two hun
dred ravening engineerlets, when the 
locked doors of the Machine Shop cut 
off his masterly retreat.
His subsequent popularity was due 
largely to the fact that he confined 
his official activities thereafter to 
despairing efforts to catch a glimpse 
of his feet, and to chaperoning intru
sive curs out of the forbidden paradise.
Having evaded this dubious angelt 
with the flaming-moustache at the en
trance, one might wander through 
this holy of holies in Sabbath deco
rum piously reading the golden texts 
posted at frequent intervals, the senti
ments of which being rather monoton
ous; apparently snappy paraphrases 
of the ten commandments, executed 
by a literary genius with a punch in 
either hand.
A touching and tender thought, that 
of keep off the grass.
It is rumored that the consecrated 
animals to whom are assigned the 
privilege of propelling the honorable 
lawn mowers, are required to wear 
bed room slippers in the discharge of 
their duties.
You have seen the man with the 
umbrella, havent you? Have you 
ever seen the man without the um
brella?
Frantic assurances of the governj ment employe who pretends to be on 
intimate terms with the elements 
have no influence whatever on the 
touching devotion of these old friends.
Whether the omnipresence of this 
female weapon and formidable pal of 
the hatpin is a covert insult to the 
local weather guesser, whose batting 
average is about .025 or whether it is 
to forestall its traditional tendency 
to elope with the first casual visitor 
is a question we propose for the final 
exam of the Senior Class.
And then this national game as 
rendered (rendered is the word al
right) by the Maggie Murphy Ama
zonian League'! As viewed at a safe 
and sane distance from the east wind
ows of the Science Building it is 
thrilling and stupefying. With this 
twittering spectacle in course of erup
tion on the athletic field, integrals and 
differentials execute fantastic evolu
tions, resulting in a bow knot, and 
the cerebal moment of rotation in the 
class passes beyond the confines of 
the logarithmic table.
Flossie comes to the bat at a critical 
moment and in the agony of the sec
ond strike loses her chewing gum, 
and her rat, the runner scoring 
from third in the confusion. Three 
Science Sophs delirious with excite
ment.
Having been resuscitated by the 
official hair dresser, the batter resumes 
her place at the plate, which has been 
meanwhile manicured with old Dutch 
Cleanser by the umpiress and vicious-tyf Ws-ives the ball fully fifteen feet 
toward the third base debutante, who 
in a theoretical throw to first slightly 
disables the umpiress who has taken 
refuge (with shrieks) in the grand
stand.
By the time the ball is restored to 
the pitcher, minus its pink bow, the 
runner has arrived at first a trifle be
hind schedule. The game is called 
for five minutes while the substitutes 
collect her hairpins and administer 
first aid to the toilette. We are told 
that the rules .require the first base 
lady to keep cold cream and a powder 
puff at her station.
The runner then steals second, while 
the subsequent batter is explaining to 
the catcher that she has a freckle on 
her nose, and the game breaks up in 
a riot, while operations are resumed 
at the Science School, with wet rags 
around the instructors heads.
As a result of a recent demand on 
the part of the undergraduates at the 
University of Kansas, the signals for 
the closing of all classes will be given 
by a blast of the University whistle. 
Instructions accompanying the schedule 
say: Students are authorized and ex
pected to leave their classes promptly 
after not hearing the signal. Instrucwill consider this a discourtesy.
Pledges aggregating $1,200,000 have 
been secured at Harvard for the con
struction of a set of freshman dormi
tories. The buildings will consist of 
twelve wings facing Charles River. 
Each tenant will be provided with a 
parlor in which to receive his friends, 
shower baths, tennis courts, a large 
common room, and a dining hall are 
also included in the plans.

TEST OF A RE-INFORCED CONCRETE BEAM 
IN THE MATERIALS LABORATORY
Here is some good philosophy as 
seen in the Trinity Tripod.
Your true brother scholar is never 
a mark-gabber. He is a man who con
centrates on a group of courses in a par
ticular field, and is content with a fair
ly creditable mark in others.
H in everything means thorough in 
nothing. A man out for HV cant 
afford to be originalto think. He 
must simply memorize and repeat. To 
think for onesself is to run the risk of 
being wrong. Your scholar would 
rather think and be wrong than merely
repeat like a parrot or a phonograph.
Satan: I have called you'in to ex
plain this peculiar record. You are 
recorded with the same lie in seventeen 
thousand times. This is the only sin 
you have committed. I am curious to 
know why you told this same lie so 
many times.
New Arrival: Well, your majesty,
its this way: My wife is very fat, and
every time we passed a woman who 
was the least bit plump, she would say, 
Am I as fat as that? , And I always 
replied, Mercy my dear' No!Ex.
