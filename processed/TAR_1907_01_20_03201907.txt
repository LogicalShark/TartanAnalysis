Glee Club Rendered Fine Program 
for the Benefit of Athletics.
Week Beginning Monday, March 25.
It would be advisable to call out 
the base-ball candidates, and to 
get the Track Team down to 
training during this week, weath
er permitting, of course.
On Friday evening, March 15, the 
musical clubs of the school tendered 
a testimonial concert for the benefit 
of the delinquent Athletic Associa
tion. A large and enthusiastic audi
ence, interspersed with a number of 
M. M. C. S. girls, taxed the general 
assembly room to its utmost capacity. 
The glee club was at its best and 
every number brought forth well 
merited applause. The mandolin 
club played well and was forced to 
render encores after every number.
Director Hamerschlag delivered a 
neat speech before the musical pro
gram began, in which he commented 
upon athletics, and their relation to 
a students life in college and after
life. He said that the gymnasium 
was not a necessary adjunct to the 
successful athletic team, citing those 
colleges which are especially prom
inent in the athletic world as not 
being advocates of the gymnasium. 
He assured the students that a swim
ming pool would be installed in one 
of the buildings of the group to be 
erected soon. He furthermore stated 
that he would recommend to the 
trustees the construction of a Tech

The Wave of Reform.
For more than two years a 
great moral wave has been sweep
ing over this country and giving 
birth to many reforms. Dis
honesty and corruption in poli
tics, insurance circles and finan
cial institutions are apparent, and 
many heretofore regarded as hon
est in all their dealings with their 
fellows are branded as they really 
are. Exposures have been the re
sult, and even now we are dispos
ed to think that we are in the 
midst of an era of great changes. 
These changes for the better 
must be brought about by a slow 
process, but they are coming.
The light is now tinging the 
mountain tops, but will soon dis
pel the darkness in the valleys be
neath, when all men will appreci
ate improved conditions, and con
fidence will once more be restor
ed. 
Let the good work proceed 
with vigor, and all that is good 
and honorable in man manifest it
self and furstrate evil of whatever 
character, and more cheerful con
ditions will soon prevail.Ex
change.
FreshmanNo. They are hard 
to do.Exchange.
It is reported that one of Har
vey, N. D., fastidious newly mar
ried ladies kneads bread with her 
gloves on. This incident may be 
somewhat peculiar, but there are 
others. The editor of this paper 
needs bread with his shoes on, he 
needs bread with his shirt on, he 
needs bread with his pants on, 
and unless some of the delinquent 
subscribers of this Old Bag of 
Freedom pay up before long, he 
wdll need bread without a thing 
on, and North Dakota is no Gar
den of Eden in the winter time.

INVENTORS SOCIETY.
It has been learned that the second 
section of the Inventors Society 
spent a very pleasant evening last 
Tuesday at the home of Prof. Fol
lows in Woodmont street. For the 
convenience of handling the society 
at such social gatherings, it has been 
divided into two sections; the first 
section visited Prof. Follows about 
a month ago. From the reticence 
of those who attended last Tuesday, 
concerning the details of the affair, 
it looks as though every one had a 
good time.
---------o---------
Plebe Resolutions on the Death of 
Prof. Hornbostles Mother.
We, the student body of the Car
negie Technical Schools, do hereby 
extend to you our most heartfelt 
sympathies in the recent sad  be
reavement which has befallen you.
We all feel that you have lost that 
which has been nearest and dearest 
to you at all timesyour mother. 
We, therefore, take this means of 
conveying our sincerest regrets and 
beg to share a part of your great 
sorrow.
Student Committee. 
---------o---------
PRESENTATION OF TOOLS.
The Brown & Sharpe Co., of Prov
idence, R. I., has presented the school 
with a collection of all the small tools 
made by them. They are mounted 
in a glass case with a back ground 
of Tartan.
Miss Hammon, of the M. M. C. S., 
says that he has not yet received the 
stake in her recently won wager 
with a class president.
We believe in reciprocity. It is no 
more than fair to take a girl out 
skating when one wants to skate 
with a lady every time. Those who 
take girls have a reasonable objec
tion to having their ladies cards 
filled with stags while they skate 
alone or seek the solace of the smok
ing room.
After the picture was taken on the 
evening of March 11, 07, the class 
of 1911 assembled for their regular 
monthly meeting. In commenting 
on what was done the first thing to 
be mentioned is the fact that it took 
one and one-quarter hours to transact 
twenty minutes business. At the 
last meeting some of the admiring 
friends of the class foot-ball team 
started an agitation on behalf of the 
team with a view to obtaining class 
numerals for their services. With 
becoming modesty the matter was 
dropped on a motion made and sec
onded by members of the team, who 
declared they were not seeking the 
notoriety attendant upon such an agi
tation. The members, who at the 
last meeting, made so much ado 
about the lack of originality in the 
holding of a banquet, failed to pro
duce any suggestions at all, and were 
silently acquiescent in all matters 
pertaining to the banquet, which was 
finally decided upon. The Messrs. 
Edwards, Keelan, Farrel, Oren, Hinau and Lonergan were appointed to 
canvass their respective sections to 
find out how many men could be de
pended upon to attend a banquet. 
These gentlemen are to act as a sub
committee and in harmony with the 
regular social committee. After the 
conclusion of a few routine matters 
the meeting adjourned.
Any members of the class of 1911 
who have had experience on good 
basket ball teams are requested to 
communicate with A. F. Stamm as 
soon as possible. There is something 
doing, or will be, if enough good 
players can be rounded up.
A casual glance over the personal 
column, especially in the night class 
pages, will reveal the indifference 
with which the students aid the staff. 
The personals are getting fewer and 
poorer, and consequently the work 
is getting harder for the editor. Lend 
a hand and note the improvement in 
the paper.
---------o---------
1910
The concert given by the Glee and 
Mandolin Clubs at the Edgewood Club 
on March 8th, was successful in every 
way. The concert itself was over at
10 oclock, when dancing was in
dulged in until midnight. The hall 
was comfortably filled with an ap
preciative audience and praise for 
the good work of both clubs was 
heard on all sides.
At a meeting held March 11th, the 
Giee and Mandolin Clubs were con
solidated and the following officers 
were chosen to serve until the end 
of the school year of 1908:
PresidentJ. H. Taxis.
Secretary-TreasurerNewcomer.
ManagerRobt. Parsons.
Assistant ManagerL. J. Schaedle.
These officers constitute an Exec
utive Committee, which will control 
the affairs of the combined clubs.
The banquet of 1910 scheduled for 
March 16, has been postponed until 
after the Easter recess.
Have you handed in your order for 
the Thistle?
Wonder why the men who call the 
meetjypgs of the Athletic Association 
are never on hand?
How did it happen that Schaedle 
was at the hall on time the night of 
the concert?
---------o---------
SCHOOL SPIRIT.
Speaking of school patriotism, one 
of the M. M. C. S. students sold 54 
tickets for the concert last Friday 
night, which was more than the en
tire representation from some ofthe 
departments of the schools.

Apply of Miss Smith.
One day last week on one of our 
downtown streets a man jostled a 
messenger who was carrying a pack
age of stationery, causing the boy to 
drop the same over the wet and
dirty pavement. In looking over the 
heads of the curious crowd we dis
covered a girl wearing a C. T. S. pin, 
helping the crying boy tie his pack
ages together again. Thats the kind 
of material we have in our depart
ment.
During the past week the members 
of a night class of M. M. C. S. had an 
excellent opportunity to gaze upon 
the handiwork of the cooking section 
of that school. A daintily arranged 
planked shad with all the flxins  
was chosen, butnothing more sub
stantial than the delicious aroma of 
the fish was given them.
The Apprentices and Journeymen 
are making preparation for a smoker 
which, according to reports, is going 
to surpass all that have gone before. 
Elaborate plans are being made and 
the co-operation of every A. & J. man 
is asked. Miller may be consulted 
as to plans.
