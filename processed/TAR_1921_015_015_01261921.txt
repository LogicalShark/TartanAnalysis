LOSE TO MARIETTA 26-21
Playing their most brilliant game of 
the season; featured with fast and 
superior individual work coupled with 
the smoothest team work that has been 
seen on the Tech floor this season, 
the Tartain quintet, coming from be
hind in the second half, defeated West 
Virginiii by a 28-25 score.
Dosey, former center, a product ot 
Westinghouse High, played a stellar 
rame at forward and his foul shooting 
was a big factor in Techs victory. 
Pittman, who did so well on the grid
iron this fall, proved himself as cap
able in basket ball. His fast work at 
guard and long shots brought the 
i.rowd to their feet more than once.
The West Virginia . lads kept the 
.score about even during the first half 
and it was two clever field goals by 
Potter and Johnson that put them inl he lead 3 points at the end of the half.
Techs team work, and shooting was 
greatly improved in the recond period. 
The Scotchmen, by their dogged fight
ing spirit, caught up to the Buckhannon gang about the middle of the 
period and for a short time following 
the play was marked by rough play
ing with neither team scoring. Sud
denly Pittman,, the elusive Tartan 
guard, broke past the Wesleyan de
fense and caged a pretty field goal 
from -under the basket. Dosey then 
made Techs lead more secure by 
dropping in a foul. The Methodists 
fought hard to gain the lead during 
the remaining playing time and were 
successful in tieing the score, but just 
before the final whistle blew the Tech 
gang sprinted again and regained the 
three-point lead just before the game 
 nded.
The lineup of the Tech team was 
a surprise to those who witnessed the 
contest, as it appeared that there was 
a new team on the floor. The team on 
the floor Saturday night was one which 
displayed pass work and speed. The 
combination was at no, time, during 
the game, weak and for every basket 
scored by the opponents Tech came 
right back with a tally. Lineup:

Twenty-six Juniors and 34 Sopliomoiieh completed their last project on 
Saturday night, January 15. A City 
Market' was the Junior problems and 
A Window With a Balcony was the 
Sophomore order problem. These pro
jects .will be judged at the Beaux-Arts 
Institute, New York, January 25.
Many statements similar to the 
above have appeared in the Tartan, 
ap'd few. outside of Design, know any
thing concerning the Beaux-Arts In
stitute and its collection with Techs, 
Architectural Department.
The system for the study of Archi
tectural Design conducted by the 
Beaux-Arts Institute of Design is, of 
course,, founded on that of the Ecole 
Des Beaux-Arts in Paris, The work 
of the foreign school has been trans
planted in America, where it has pros
pered and grown, under the tutelage 
of men, many of whom have trained 
in Paris.
Institutions and colleges which fol
low the program and work as directed 
by the Beaux-Arts of America form 
the ateliers of the school. Carnegie 
Tech, Columbia, University of Penn
sylvania, Cornell and Boston Tech are 
the largest schools represented.
Programs Lor problems are sent to 
these various schools and preliminary 
sketches or studies are made same 
by all students who wish to complete 
the proj.ac*. Such sketches are called 
esqulses and they are sent to New 
York, where they are held until the 
finished problems arrive. At a fixed 
time a jury, composed of practicing 
architects, gather at the Beaux-Arts 
school and judge the work. Each 
school represented at the competition 
sand's a representative to this jury, 
The name cards, containing the name 
of the school and the student, are

Marietta College defeated Carnegie 
Tech, 26 to 21, in an exciting contest 
here. Tech lead in the first half, 7 to 
5. The visitors outplayed Marietta in 
the first period, but in the second were 
completely baffled by Mariettas team 
work. Tech fought hard but vainly in 
the. last minutes of play to overcome 
the. home teams lead. Boggs, whv 
substituted in the seeond half for 
Marietta, starred,' along with Reiter, 
while Bell shared honors with Dosey.

The mystic land of enchantments, 
the'home of the people who have lived 
in the imagination of humans for ages. 
The realm of the immortals. This was 
the foyers of the Arts building last 
Friday night at the annual ball. I-Iere 
the gords, gnomes, banshees and spir
its danced and made merry. Little 
thought was given to time limited by 
fate to a passing period of a few 
hours, that soon the hour of four 
would arrive. At the gong of the 
clock the retroversion began. The 
merry, makers must again return to 
earth. Those unnatural beings wrought 
frOm the imagination of the ancient 
Norsemen, from t.he dreams of Wag
ner, Jurgenieff and Stevenson shall 
again become mere students of ,th* 
Revision of the arts. Like a dream of 
passing fancy beautiful to see but sad 
to imagine was the motly procession 
which left the building just before day 
light and brought to an end the most 
successful ball yet.
Costumes were derived from the 
myths, folk lore of the Scandinavians, 
Celts, Anglo-Saxons anil Teutons which 
permitter a wide range of selection 
and much latitude for imaginat ion. The 
floor, viewed from the alcoves, was a 
dreanr of color fantastic and beautiful. 
Here mingled the godfe of Valhalla, 
Thor. Odin, Brunliilcle and Lolci of 
Norse mythology. Spirits of fog 
guards of Rhine gold, Lorelei, from 
Wagners songs; theyishes trans
formed into animals, from Grimms 
Fairy Tales; banshees, witches 
dwarfs from the minds of the. ancient 
Celts. The costumes were extraor
dinary, many original, designed by 
the "students' from their own concep 
tions. The decorations were not as 
elaborate as last year but more suc
cessful because subordinate to the 
costumes. The walls of foyer and 
main entrance hall were hung with 
blue draperies, having striking, rich, 
grotesque designs in gold, yellow and 
red. The uniformity interrupted by

1920 THISTLE A SUCCESS 
BOARD TO BE ENTERTAINED
Yea, let us hence to the Follies, 
starring the Margaret Morrison 
Juniors, eclipsing the productions of 
Flo Ziegfeld. Remember, the number, 
its . a lucky one, 36, or as the loga
rithmic tables would have it, 1.5563.
It all starts on a Friday evening, at 
S oclock, in the gymnasium of the M. 
M. D. building, and the final appear
ance is Sunday evening, the day fol
lowing. As to finances, why its sur
prising how moderate the prices are, 
it being $1 for the first 10 rows, and 
75 cents for the last 20 rows.
After each performance there will 
he a  dance in the recreation room, 
from 10 oclock until 12. The music 
is to be furnished by the Margaret 
Morrison Orchestra. All this for just 
the price of admission. Who says that 
the old H. C. Lis not coming down?
Dont forget the dates, February 4 
and 5.
Last years Thistle with its neat 
brown leather cover was the most 
successful in every way than any of 
its predecessors. The entire issue of 
1920 copies were successfully disposed 
of with the exception of a limited 
number, which may be had from Dr. 
Baker at last years price. Financially 
there is a profit of approximately 
5450.00, which is the mo# made up to 
the present time. In view of this and 
the good work done by the board in 
getting the book together, the S. A. B. 
has voted them an entertainment 
which will be a theater party at the 
Nixon on the twenty-fifth of this month 
to^.see Ethel Barrymore.

MR. PETERSON. OF 
ENG. DEP.COACH
Feeling that an association oC men 
from the 'South would be beneficial to 
those men that are in school and that 
it would prove an inducement, to other 
men from the South and that, un or
ganization of this kind would be a 
means to produce a greater bond be
tween the two sectious of the country 
a Southern Club has been organized.
Before the war there .existed such a 
club at Tech but since then nothing 
has been, heard of it. The club at 
present plans to extend its work over 
a wider range than before and hopes 
to establish a closer fellowship 
tween the men of the Southland.

EXECUTIVE COM. ON 
ATHLETIC DRIVE
be
A triangular debate has been 
arranged between Tech, W. & J. and 
University of West Virginia. The ten 
tative date is set for Sept. 15. The first 
tiyout will be held probably on or 
about Feb. 3. The question is: Re
solved, that the several states should 
enact legislation for the establishment 
of courts of industrial relations sim
ilar to the Kansas court.
Debating is a new activity at Tech 
and offers every man or woman of 
this school an opportunity to enter in 
to something that is the best kind of 
m'ental training; also will develop the 
ability for one to go before a body 
to talk and think straight. Debating 
is a big activity at most schools and 
should .be here. We now have the op
portunity to establish -permanently, 
we.hope, this form of sport at Tech. 
The other schools represented in this 
triangle have done debating for many 
years. It seems that we must get the 
best material available. That wo have 
good debaters here is no doubt, but 
th'.* studento must come out.
Mr. Peterson of the English de.partment who was the main influence 
in the organization of the Forum and 
has encouraged debating at this school 
for a. long time, will coach the teams; 
He has charge of public speaking here 
anil has had much experience both in 
taking part in inter-collegiate debat
ing also coaching and criticising t.eamis. 
He is a momber of Phi Kappa Delta, 
the honorary forensic fraternity which 
lias chapters in all big schools.
There will be two teams from each 
.UiLiool, affirmative and uegat.lv.-, no 
arranged that each school will have a 
debate at. home and abroad. There 
should bo 30 people out. Any one who 
expects to try out should study one 
side or the question and prepare to 
give a five minute direct speech. Defin
ite announcement regarding the time 
and place of try-outs will be given tin 
the next issue of the Tartan.

M. M. D. NIGHT SCHOOL DANCE
The night school girls of the Mar
garet Morrison Division will give a 
dance in the Union on the evening of 
January 28.. A good orchestra has 
been secured for the evening, and i 
goodtime is promised to all who at 
tend.
A Wireless Telephony Concert by 
the Carnegie Tech Band, under the 
auspices of the Westinghouse Manu
facturing aid Electric Co. will bo 
heard throughout the country on the 
night of February 11. It will be a novel 
concert and the Carnegie Tech Baud 
will have the distinction of being the 
first collegiate band to send its music 
over the country on electro-magnetic 
waves. ;
Arrangements are being made for a 
concert at Erie, Pa., some time next 
month and many other small trips 
around Pittsburgh are on the schedule. 
Men must be out for practice on Tues
day nights at the Union. The man
agement feels the band is not repre
sentative of the musical ability at 
Tech. There are many good players 
Avho do not take interest enough to 
come out. When the band make's a 
public appearance the people take it 
for the best that Tech> can produce, 
regardless of what circumstances, and 
it reflects on every one of the student 
body who can make the band better. 
The band at present is sorely in need 
of a baritone player, several trom
bone players and a few alto players.
All men must report at the Union 
Tuesday night, February 1, at 7:00 
oclock or turn their uniforms in.
That Niagara has lost none of its 
beauty and grandeur in spite of its 
utilization as a source of electrical en
ergy was the claim made last Wednes
day at assembly in! the Lecture Hall 
by Mr. George S. Anderson of the 
Niagara Falls Power Company, and 
he had the camera with him to prove 
that ho was right. Liko the Arab and 
his magic carpet of old, the studonts 
were transferred to the land of en
chantment, the land of rushing watoii; 
and eternal mists, of cascados and rap
ids and falls. For nearly an hour the 
students almost, forgot, the lunch 
period and joined the tourists and the 
honoymoonors in their trips about, the 
Falls and the rivers above them; and 
very easily was the audience con
vinced that man with his ugly bridges 
and puny power plants can do nothing 
to muzzle the mighty giant, Niagara.
Mr. Androson, with the aid of mov
ing picture, also outlined the growth 
of the company ho reproaontod, and 
showed the great advance In the ap
plication of water power from the 
crude, ancient Chinese wheel to the 
comparatively recont breast wheel 
and ovorshot wheel and, finally, to the 
modern turbine, a triumph of hy
draulics.
The details of the erection ol! a 
power plantthe tubes, the shafts, the 
turbines, tho valves, the generators, 
etc.wore exhibited, tho chief Impres
sion which they left being the tre
mendous size of tho parts, tho John
son needle valve alone weighing 
i00,000 pounds.
A discussion of tho design of gen
erators used in the power house was 
given by Mr. Douglass, of tho Westinghotiso Electric Company. He also 
explained the assembling of a turbine 
and Its generators In a power plant.
Preparations for the big athletlo 
drive conducted by the Athletic Coun
cil during the last two weeks in Feb
ruary are iregressing very rapidly and 
satisfactorily. There is a great 
amount of detail work to be planned 
out and organized in proper manner 
so that the maximum amount, of 
ground can bo covered with the min
imum effort. It. can well be seen that 
an effort to reach all of those students 
Who have some time or other attended 
Carnegie Tech with the appeal is a 
task, especially in view' of the fact 
that there are at least IS,000 former 
students and alumni.
The main executive committee, un
der bho chairmanship of Graduate 
Manager Frank H. Haaron. consists of 
JO alumni, the personnel of which com
mittee Is as follows: James W. Bat

WHAT DATE?
MUSICAL CLUBS TO GIVE 
CONCERT AT YOUNGSTOWN
(ho
On Wednesday evening, January 26, 
the musical clubs will givo a concert 
at South High school of Youngstown, 
The clubs have given concerts at 
Youngstown for the past three years 
and it is considered one of the most 
important concerts on the schedule, 
exclusive of the .Home Concert.
It was expected that the clubs would 
take a three/ day trip, beginning with 
the concert at Youngstown, but owing 
to the several cancellations such a 
trip could not be made.
Nevertheless the clubs will no doubt 
line up to the reputation, gained by 
them during the'past three years and 
will put over a successful concert.
After the concert the Jazz Orchestra 
made up of members of the clubs 
will furnish the music for a dance 
given for the clubs by the Youngstown 
Alumni Association.

CAMPUS WEEK
This inuy seem a I'utlier early date to mention Campus Week, 
which will not take plane until some time in Hie Spring Quarter. But 
in order to make the celebration even a greater success than it was 
Iasi year, it is necessary to begin preparations as early as possible. 
The committee has been appointed* and they arc anxious to get 
started on their plans at once.
hast year, .liter Campus Week was over, there was hardly u 
student on the campus who did not have some suggestion to make as 
to how the affair could have been improved. Each one knew of some 
stunt or other which had been used at other schools, and which would 
have added much to our celebration. The trouble with almost, all ol: 
these suggestions was that .they were offered after everything was 
over and they could not be used. These improvements can and will, 
of course, be used lliis year, but it; is also imperative that anyone who 
has any ideas for this'years Campus Week should bring them for
ward at as early a date as possible. The experience gained from last 
year will certainly enable us to make this event a much better one,

operation ol: everyone at Tech.
SHIP AHOY I
The next most important event on the Tech calendar is probably 
the Arts Division musical comedy, Ship Ahoy,' scheduled for 
March 4 and 5 at the Schenley Theater. It is important in that it 
is the biggest advertising stunt to bo carried out, during the year, for 
on that occasion, as on no other, the people of the city have an oppor
tunity To see what tho school can do in the way of a commercial pro
duction entirely under the control of the student body. It is to be 
well advertised, and all members of the division will soon be at work 
on tho production, which we feel, certain will rival last years 
extravaganza.
PROM!
Why do girls "go away to school?" 
Why, to go to the Prom, of course! Its

Canon Talbot of the Episcopal Cath
edral at Washington. 1>. C., gave a 
very interesting lecture last. Wednes
day in the Arts building on the life 
and work of El Greco, the sixteenth 
century Spanish painter and writer.
The artist was born in Candia, Italy, 
hut when a very young man went to 
Toledo, Spain, with a group of Italian, 
artists to work on the church of St_ 
Dominic, which was being erected at 
that town. Here he spent the rest of 
his life. His art. was of a religious 
nature, in that lie strived to express 
Christian ideals. His work lias a 
marked individuality, sculpture accent 
tiut rarely exquisite. Tho idea was 
always predominate, details second
ary. Ho endeavored foremost to give 
life to his characters. This life and 
action is the finest quality of the 200 
pieces of art lie left to the world.
His masterpiece is the "Assumption 
in the church of St. Vincent at Toledo. 
Next best known is tho Disrobing,' 
in the church of St. Dominic in the 
same city.

of study. However those services are 
especially for yon; speakers who are 
interested in students, and who have 
had success with them are secured. 
Their message represents something 
not obtained at a. regular Sunday 
church service; something prepared 
with much time and thought1 for you 
alone.
Therefore come tomorrow and show 
that you care. A good t ime is assured 
at the banquet, which is 50 Cents a

GROVE CITY AND ALLEGHENY NEXTFriday night at the Duqucsno Gurtiens,' Tech will,stack up against the 
team representing the University of 
Pennsylvania in hockey, it is one of 
few opportunities for Carnegie Teoh 
supporters to witness their team in 
action, and judging from their per
formances on the ice during the last 
few weeks the team representing Tech 
will put up a spirited tight.
For practice the Tech boys have 
been playing various teams in the city 
league, many of which are star aggre
gations, including the Barbours, which 
is composed of players, all of whom 
came from either Yale or Princeton, 
and while at their respective institu
tions played with the Varsity, It is 
teams of this calibre against which 
Tech has been playing their practice 
games, and the fine points which they 
have acquired by these encounters is 
bound to develop their team work.
Dickey, Andrews, Martelle and Perc 
Jewell have been caging the puck reg
ularly and Godden, Schmertz, Huff and 
Hedlund have .done much creditable 
work on the defense line. The game 
against Penn will be fast, because it 
Lias been agreed that the teams will 
play six mail hockey. This Was tried 
out the other night, in a game against 
the team representing the West Penn 
Power Company, and found that it 
was a much faster game than the rugular seven man line up. In the six 
man line up the Rover is eliminated^ .
More games are pending and Man
ager Franklin will endeavor to bring 
more teams to Pittsburgh to compete 
with Tech, so that the students will 
have the opportunity of soeing the 
team in action again. Hockey, being 
in its infancy, will need the loyal sup
port of all tho loyal Techites, so lots 
try and make a special effort to see 
the Ponn-Carnegie Tech game, next 
Friday night.

NEW YORK ALUMNI 
BANQUET JANUARY 29
The second annual banquet of the 
Alumni Federation of the Carnegie In
stitute of Technology in Now York 
will be held under the auspices of the 
New York Clan in the Green Room of 
thoMcAlpiii Hotel, on Saturday. night, 
January 2!), commencing at 7 bclock.
The success of last years banquet 
brought to our attention the need for 
such a function annually. It gives us 
an opportunity to meet many of our 
dear Mends and renew acquaintances 
of our college days, and to refresh 
us wtlh the old time spirit of Carne
gie Tech. Everyone who was there 
last year had such a good time that 
preparations are being made to take 
car, of a larger crowd this year. Di
rector Hammerschlag, former Dean 
ContM'lley, as well as members of 
the Carnegie Corporation and other 
members of the faculty a.t Pittsburgh 
are to be wibli us.
These annual banquets, of which 
this will be the second, are not mere
ly of local interest. Their purpose is 
to bring together our alumni through
out the Fast for a good time once a 
year and to re-acqualnt ourselves with 
our fellow-alumni, who live neafcby. 
Many of us have classmates and fra
ternity brothers in Massachusetts, 
Connecticut, New York, New Jersey 
and Eastern Pennsylvania, whom we 
seldom or never see and some whom 
we do not know are here. We, all 
cherish the opportunity to get together 
again and talk over old times and 
new. We cannot afford to miss it. If 
you were not here last year, come this 
year, arid, see what a good time you 
missed.
This is not a strictly bachelor party. 
If you are married bring your wife 
with you. II! you are. not married you 
may bring your sweetheart. It is to be 
informal so IIyou happen to be in New 
York on business you don't need to 
worry about your stiff shirt.
Members of the New York Clan 
gladly extend' their hospitality to those 
from out of. town who will stay over 
night.
Please advise one of the committee 
so that; the necessary reservation's can 
be made. Sincerely, the Committee:'
