Van Mastrigts Confession Yields No Motive
By DRUE MILLER
Tartan News Editor
Darrell Van Mastrigt the CMU freshman 
accused of stabbing a Robert Morris student 
to death in South Park three weeks ago, 
confessed to the crime on Monday, February 
9. However, the specifics of his confession 
weren't made public until his bond hearing 
last Wednesday.
According to Van Mastrigt, he and Jeanne 
Goldberg met in the Tartan Grill the evening 
of Saturday, February 7. The two of them 
and another CMU freshman, Brian Goldberg 
(no relation), attended several fraternity 
parties together. The last party they attended 
was at DTD, which they left around 4:30 
am. Van Mastrigt claimed they had drank 
beer and smoked marijuana at the parties. 
The trio moved on to the Original Hot Dog 
Shop in Oakland, returning at 6 am to drop 
Brian off at Hammerschlag.
Brian Goldberg said of the evening's events 
that nothing Darrell said or did seemed 
unusual. Toxicology tests set Jeanne 
Goldberg's blood alcohol count (BAC) at .4 
tt the time of her death - 4 times the legal
limit of intoxication, and for many people, 
the point at which they pass out. No BAC 
on Van Mastrigt was taken, since he wasn't 
taken into custody until 24 hours later; 
however, Brian Goldberg said Van Mastrigt 
wasn't especially drunk: "He was straight 
enough to drive to the O's." He also said 
Jeanne was asleep in the back seat of the car 
on the return trip to campus.
After Brian left them, they had sex in the 
back seat of her car while it was parked in 
the lot by Hammerschlag. County Homicide 
has refrained from speculating on whether or 
not Goldberg was conscious at this point
Van Mastrigt drove to South Park, with 
Goldberg in the back seat. As he tried to get 
her out of the car, she slipped and fell. He 
then stabbed her 5 times in the neck and 15 
in the chest, and dragged her body to the 
Fairview Grove. He drove her car back to 
campus, stopping at the Birmingham Bridge 
to throw the knife into the Monongahela 
River.
According to County Homicide Detective 
John Flaherty, results from lab tests for 
drugs in Goldbergs body will be in "in
about two weeks." Flaherty declined 
comment on the possibility of drugs 
as the proximate cause.
The lack of an apparant motive has 
shocked the local community. Students who 
know Van Mastrigt characterize him as 
friendly and non-violent. Although he 
wouldn't reveal information about the 
possible motives, Flaherty said "he took her 
there for a reason..."
Psychological examinations conducted by 
the county Behavior Clinic yielded no signs 
of abnormal or unusual behavior. His 
attorney, Charles Scarlata, is expected to 
order further testing, presumably from a 
private institution.
Bond has been set at $200,000; at the time 
of printing, no one has posted the money. 
Scarlata, originally recommended that bond 
be set at $50,000. Flaherty said that if no 
one makes bond over the next few weeks, 
Scarlata might ask for a bond reduction.
Until his bond is made, Van Mastrigt 
remains in the County Jail in downtown 
Pittsburgh. His trial will come up in "two 
or three months," according to Flaherty.Rules Committee Proposes Political Forum
By KARL BARNHART
Tartan Assistant News Editor
Should Student Senate fund "political" 
organizations? Two weeks ago, an 
amendment was added to the Senate 
Constitution which defined political and 
stated their policy of non-funding to those 
organizations. However, included in that 
amendment was a note which said their goal 
of non-funding was not to insulate the 
student body from political ideas. In that 
vein, Senate's Rules Committee, chaired by 
Allen Greenberg, moved, at last Tuesday's 
meeting, to create a "Political Speakers' 
Forum Board."
According to Rules' proposal, the goal of 
the Forum Board is: "to provide a means for 
recognized campus political organizations to 
bring speakers to campus in order to: a) 
foster thought, discussion, and debate within 
the student body pertaining to important
political and policy issues; and b) attempt to 
present a balanced and diverse viewpoint on 
important political issues via the making 
available of funds for politiical speakers."
The proposal, as worded on Tuesday, was 
sent back to committee. The Forum Board 
was to be composed of Senate members 
nominated at large and one non-voting 
member from the Activities Board; the 
proposal did not stipulate the number of 
individuals for the Forum Board. The 
Chairman was to be elected by the Senate at 
large from the voting members of the Forum 
Board.
On Friday the Rules Committee met and 
revised the proposed format The new 
version, which will be voted on tonight in 
Senate, calls for a seven-member board 
composed of four senators and three people 
from the campus community. To gain a 
seat, interested students would have to
High Altitude Brownies (formerly Secondary Modern), a popular student 
band, performed to a full house at Scotland V ard Saturday night.
submit a petition with 25 signatures and 
then be voted on by the Senate.
According to Greenberg, the Forum Board 
was also to act as a "subsection" of AB 
Lectures. It was to be allocated money via 
AB Lectures, AB Lectures was to reserve the 
right to charge admission at Forum's 
lectures, and AB was to be responsible for 
all event logistics including advertisement, 
room reservations and transportation for the 
speaker to and from campus. The Forum 
Board was to determine for which speakers 
money was to be allocated, but those 
allocations were not to exceed the monetary 
limit approved by the Funding and 
Recognition Committeee and the Student 
Senate at large.
Under the current system employed by 
Senate, the only way to fund a political 
speaker is through a "special allocation.'' In 
other words, if a group or organization wants 
Senate to fund a political speaker, a 
representative must appear before Senate and 
apply for money. No such allocations have 
been made this academic year.
AB Lectures does book and fund some 
political speakers. But those speakers are 
"block booked" at a convention at the 
beginning of the year because of AB's 
limited budget. Frank Zappa and Phyllis 
Schafly appeared through AB by this 
method.
But the question remains: how popular will 
even this political forum be with groups 
such as the College Republicans, Students 
Against Apartheid, ami the Democatic 
Socialists all active political groups on 
campus. Rollie Wesen, a member of 
Students Against Apartheid and one of the 
non-editors of the Student Union, aid he 
"was pretty mixed" about the Forum.
"Its a good idea to provide funding to 
politcal speakers, but I dont see how it can 
be fair. It would be much more appropriate 
to fund all political oganizations."
Andy Warhol Dead at 58
By KARL BARNHART
Tartan Assistant News Editor
Renowned artist and Carnegie 
Mellon alumnus, Andy Warhol, died 
Sunday, February 22, of cardiac arrest. 
After undergoing routine gallbladder 
surgery on Saturday, Warhol was 
reported to be recovering and in stable 
condition until early Sunday morning. 
He was pronounced dead at 6:31 am.
Bom Andrew Warhola Jr., the pop 
artist grew up in McKeesport His 
family moved to Dawson St. in 
Oakland when he was six and he 
graduated from Schenley High School 
in 1945. After high school, Warhol 
attended CMU (then CIT), receiving a 
BA in Pictorial Design in 1949. 
Warhol's future success was hardly 
evident then: Robert Lepper, a
professor emeritus of art at CMU, told 
the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette of the 
departments repeated attempts at 
expelling him. After graduation, 
Warhola dropped the "a" from his 
name and moved to New York City to 
illustrate advertisements.
Warhol, acclaimed by John Caldwell, 
Curator of Contemportary Art at the 
Carnegie Museum of Art, as 
"unquestionably the greatest artist ever 
to come from Pittsburgh," established 
himself as a pop artist with his silk 
screen "Campbells Soup Cans" in 
1962. He also founded the Factory, an 
art underground film, and publishing 
business, which, among other things, 
spawned the late 60's band the Velvet 
Underground. Warhol also made a 
name for himself through numerous 
super-realism films. In the 70s, 
Warhol concentrated his efforts largely 
on screen-printed portraits of 
celebrities. Interview, a celebrity 
watcher magazine Warhol began in the 
80*s, enjoys increasing popularity.
In his will, Warhol bequeathed the 
majority of his $15 million estate to 
establish a foundation for the 
advancement of visual arts. He left 
$250,000 each to his two older 
brothers, both Pittsburgh residents, 
and his agent
Retraction
In the February 17 issue of The 
Tartan it was erroneously reported that a rape 
occurred at Alpha Tau Omega. It was later 
determined that whatever incident occurred 
took place between two individuals in a 
private room. The Tartan in no way meant 
to imply that ATQ was at fault as a group. 
The Tartan information did not come from 
Campus Police but rather from private 
sources. No malice was intended toward the 
fraternity or individuals, and The Tartan 
apologizes to all parties involved few any 
negative implications that might have arisen 
as a result

Amnesty Offered to 
Philippine Rebels
Philippine President Corazon Aquino is 
offering a "full and complete amnesty" to 
rebels who lay down their arms within the 
next six months. At least 90 people have 
been killed since a truce between government 
troops and rebel forces expired earlier this 
month.
Schultz Opposes 
China's Weapon 
Sales to Iran
Secretary of State George Schultz has a 
tough job ahead of him persuading China to 
stop selling weapons to Iran. China has 
emerged as the main supplier of weapons to 
the Iranians, who are fighting a war against 
Iraq. Schultz has broached the subject before, 
but without success. He's on his way to 
China to try again, but his hand has been 
weakened considerably since news of the Iran 
arms scandal in this country.
West Beirut Steps Up 
Security Precautions
Lebanese riot police were manning 
checkpoints, frisking pedestrians and 
directing traffic along with Syrian soldiers in 
West Beirut this weekend. A police official 
says the deployment of the police officers is
part of a plan worked out between Lebanon's 
prime minister and Syrian officials. 
Thousands of Syrian troups are in West 
Beirut to quiet the fighting between the 
factions vying for control of the area.
Gorbachev Ready for 
Missile Agreement
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev says 
Moscow is ready to reach an agreement on 
medium-range missiles in Europe. The 
Soviet Union has, in the past, insisted on 
negotiating strategic, medium-range, and 
space and defense weapons as a package. 
Gorbachev said the Soviet Union is ready to 
consider medium range missiles separately. 
The State Department had no comment on 
the announcement.
Regan Announces 
Resignation, Gets 
Reagan's Praise
Outgoing Chief of Staff Donald Regan is 
getting high praise from President Reagan, 
both on the air and in print. In a letter to 
Regan made public, the president praised his 
former treasury secretary and chief of staff, 
saying, "You were of help and I thank you." 
The President also included Regan in his 
weekly radio address, saluting him for "six 
years of outstanding service" in the 
administration.
Regan's resignation came one day after the 
Tower Commission released its report on the 
Iran arms deal, which criticized decision
making and management practices in the 
administration. In his weekly radio address, 
the President said hes still studying the 
report and consulting with his advisors and 
members of Congress. He says he'll give his 
assessment of the report in an address to the 
nation next week.
250.000 Gallons Lost 
in Florida Oil Spill
Crude oil leaking from a disabled freighter 
off the coast of Jacksonville, Florida, has 
been reduced to a trickle, but the sludge is 
continuing to wash ashore. As much as
250.000 gallons of oil started leaking from 
the Liberian-registered tanker after it ran 
aground Thursday night. A coast guard 
spokesman says clean up is almost 
impossible because of tides, currents and 
choppy waters.
Record Burning Put 
Out by Fans
There was supposed to be a record-burning 
session at a church in Linwood, New Jersey, 
Friday night, but it turned into a jam session 
when rock music fans showed up with jugs 
of water to protest the burning. The pastor 
of the church says they intended to bum rock 
records as a way of protesting objectionable 
lyrics. The burning has been rescheduled.

Nuclear Test Ban: Will We Ever Have One?
By LISA McANANY
Tartan Editor-in-Chief
Can current technical means verify a 
comprehensive nuclear test ban? Could a 
small nuclear attack from the Soviet Union 
destroy the United States' ability to deploy 
its own nuclear forces? Can Reagan's 
proposed Star Wars defense system really 
protect the U.S. from a nuclear missile 
attack?
These are just a few of the formidable 
questions that were addressed by experts who 
lectured to the university community last 
week.
Contention about the untility and 
verifiability of a nuclear test ban provided 
the material for a lecture by Dr. Lynn Sykes, 
a geophysicist at Columbia University, on 
Wednesday, February 25 in Doherty Hall. 
The lecture was sponsored by the Carnegie 
Mellon Program on International Peace and 
Security.
Verification is not the main obstacle to a 
comprehensive test ban, argued Sykes. He 
is convinced that current technical 
capabilities would permit verification, but 
that the perceived need to build new weapons 
prevents the United States from following 
the Soviet lead, and imposeing a moratorium 
on all nuclear tests.
Sykes believes that the just-ended, 18- 
month-long self-imposed Soviet moratorium 
is one of the major reasons why the test ban 
issue has received so much media attention 
of late. Other reasons include the agreement 
in principle at Reykjavik to proceed towards 
a test ban and allegations that the Soviets 
have cheated on the Threshold Treaty.
The Threshold Treaty was signed by Ford 
and Brezhnev in 1976, but like SALT II, 
remains unratified. It limits the size of test 
explosions to 150 kilotons, or the explosive 
equivalent of 150,000 tons of TNT.
Continuing test ban negotiations were 
halted in 1982 by the Reagan administration. 
The administration gave three reasons for the 
decision not to continue negotiations: 
verification is not good enough; the Soviets
have cheated; and it is not in the national 
interest to have a test ban.
Dr. Sykes took issue with the first two 
reasons, syaing We could verify explosions 
down to a very small size if we had a test 
ban, though it would take a very strenuous 
monitoring effort He criticized Reagan's 
second justification by pointing out that 
both nations have tested very close to the 
limit, but, The Soviets have not tested 
above the limit
According to Sykes, Seismology is still 
the main method of test verification. He 
identified the major problem as dis
criminating between nuclear test explosions 
and earthquakes, especially since 7% of the 
world's earthquakes occur in the Soviet 
Union. But Sykes says that tests do not 
occur deeper than 10 kilometers below the
surface. Since most earthquakes are much 
deeper, Dr. Sykes is confident that making 
the distinction is not a significant problem.
During his lecture, Sykes cited several 
advantages to instituting a test ban. he 
argued that it would slow the development of 
new weapons systems, impacting weapons 
with radical new designs most. It might also 
enhance non-proliferation as other nations 
would be morally discouraged from building 
nuclear weapons by the superpower example.
Dr. Sykes also cited the perceived 
disadvantages to a test ban that prevent the 
United States from engaging in a test ban. 
He says that the U.S. believes that new 
weapons are necessary to stay ahead of the 
USSR, that verification isn't good enough, 
that tests are necessary to insure that 
stockpile weapons will still function and

Because of this relationship, university 
planners believe that there should be some 
harmony between the two new buildings.

University Center are Damianos and 
Associates of Pittsburgh, working with 
GBQC of Philadelphia; Dennis and Clark 
Associates of Cambridge, Massachusetts, 
working with TAMS Associates of Boston;

that U.S. weapons labs and government 
agencies see a test ban as a threat to their 
existence and primary mission.
But Sykes emphasized, "The real issue we 
have to deal with is the philosophical one of 
whether the United States interests are or are 
not served by a comprehensive test ban.

ourselves just to univeristy architects. We 
wanted a diverse group, she explains.
The competition will lead to the selection 
of a design in early May. It will be a result 
of the assessment of the proposed designs by 
a panel consisting of Carnegie Mellon 
personnel and independent architects.
There are no students currently on the 
panel, but a suggestion from Student Senate 
may change this. The decision to appoint a 
student is waiting final approval from panel 
chair Nierenberg, who is out of the country. 
At this time, the panel includes Omer Akin, 
head of the architecture deparment; John 
Anderson, head of chemical engineering; Pat 
Crecine, Senior Vice Presidnet for Academic 
Affairs; Bill Elliott, Vice President for 
Enrollment; and Fred Rogers.
The four independent architects included on 
the panel are Thomas H. Beeby of New 
Haven, Graham Gund of Cambridge, Charles 
Gwarthmey of New York and Dahlen Riches 
of Bradfordwoods Pennsylvania, who is a 
University Trustee Emeritus.

Plan Pole Sit for Charity
Starting Saturday, April 4th at 6PM 
and running through spring Carnival, 
the Brothers and Little Sisters of Theta 
Xi Fraternity and the Sisters of Delta 
Delta Delta Sorority will be holding a 
Pole Sit. The purpose of this event is 
to raise funds for the Multiple 
Sclerosis Society, Childrens Hospital, 
and the Karin Johnson Asthma 
Research Foundation.
During this event a 40-foot pole with 
a platform on top will be raised near 
Skibo where we will be sitting every 
hour during the week. Every day, there 
will be activities such as picnics, 
barbecues, contests, games, and 
celebrity appearances.
Our goal this year is to raise 
$20,000. Over the past two years, we 
raised over $18,000. So far this year 
$7,200 has already been raised by 
soliciting the streets around Pittsburgh. 
In this next couple of weeks, well still 
be coming around to the dorms asking 
you to sponsor us for sitting on the 
pole. Please help us support these 
worthy causes. If you would like to 
actively help us, please call Reid at 
x5496 or x3543.

Editorial
Move the Fraternities
Lack of space always poses problems on an urban 
campus. Carnegie Mellon certainly feels the crunch. 
Scarcity of parking and student living spoace has the 
administration going through all sorts of contortions to find 
extra parking and off-campus housing. But there may be an 
easier solution right under the university's proverbial nose.
The fraternity houses, as currently situated, occupy a 
spacious plot of land. It would be advantageous for the 
university and the fraternities if the frats moved off campus.
The potential benefits for the university are obvious. The 
frat houses could either be put to use for student housing or 
the current buildings could be razed to yield space for new 
buildings and parking.
Disadvantages for the university would include the loss of 
revenue from rent paid by the fraternities for the use of their 
houses and the loss of control over the doings of the 
fraternities. If the frats move off campus, they will sacrifice 
their immunity from the law granted by Campus Police.
The underage drinking that is acceptable on campus not oe perceived as sucn out in the real world.
There would also doubtlessly be neighbor relations 
problems. Devon Road and Clyde Street residents have 
already made justified complaints about the noisiness of 
Carnegie Mellon students. If the fraternities move into 
Shadyside or Squirrel Hill, they will have to turn down the 
volume of their parties or face repercussions from the City 
of Pittsburgh.At the same time, moving off campus would have 
numerous advantages for the fraternities. The rent they pay 
on their current houses would surely be enough to pay the 
mortgage on a house of significant size. While they would 
lose legal immunity, they would gain the freedom 
associated with owning their own houses rather than 
renting them from Carnegie Mellon.The Tower Report: Scapegoating Extraordinaire
The Tower Commission shocked many people with its 
open criticism of Ronald Reagan's management style and 
its implication that he was oblivious to the goings-on within 
his own administration. But the presidentially-appointed 
commission, headed by former Republican Senator John 
Tower, actually produced a predictably safe and forgiving 
analysis of the Iran arms deals.
The Tower Report only fingers expendable figures in 
Washington. By the time the report came out, everybody 
had been told that McFarlane, Poindexter and North are 
guilty, and everyone suspected that White House Chief of 
Staff Donald Regan might be on his way out, guilty or not. 
The Tower Commission could condemn these parties 
without challenging the status quo.
The report took no chances when it came to the most 
powerful players. The analysis simply reinforced our 
preconceptions about the roles of Ronald Reagan and 
George Bush. But George Bush is a de facto member of the 
National Security Council. According to the report, he 
attended at least three meetings of the NSC in which the 
arms deal was discussed. Shouldnt one mention of the 
scam have been enough to evoke some action from the Vice 
President?
And what about Reagan? Even if Regan did not blatantly 
break the law, he certainly compromised the national 
interest through his negligence.
Reagan is known for his refusal to ever scapegoat an 
individual. But the Tower Commission has done it for him. 
By pointing the finger at lesser staff members, the 
administration can now purge these individuals, pick up the 
pieces of the presidency, and save face for the Republican 
Party and George Bush in 1988.
Spiffying up Skibo
Why did it take a once-a-year affair like the President's 
Ball to get Skibo spiffied up? The weekend before the 
auspicious event took place, there were suddenly lights in 
the Skibo stairwell. The purple, magic marker glory of the 
larger-than-life appendages that continually grace one of the 
lower level men's rooms mysteriously disappeared under a 
coat of latex.
The tidying-up of Skibo was half of a biannual ritual 
that makes an effort to make the building look presentable. 
The other furious effort takes place just before commencement.
It is unfortunate that the school tries to hide the 
hideousness of Skibo from the guests at the President's 
Ball or the parents at commencement, yet insists that the 
students live with it year round. Who doesn't have any 
school pride?
Letters:
VP Crecine Clarifies Purpose of 
NeXT Investment, Explains Role 
on Board of Directors
Editor:
I am writing in response to 
Associate Professor of English, 
Paul Smith's, column in the 
February 17 issue of The Tartan, 
"Venture Capital and Carnegie 
Mellon: What NeXT?"
The article is about Carnegie 
Mellon's $650,000 investment in 
NeXT, Inc. and Mother's Day, 
1988.
Prof. Smith clearly feels that the 
NeXT investment should have 
followed a public debate on the 
merits of the investment. For a 
startup company, this is 
tantamount to discussing secret 
plans in public. In essence Mr. 
Smith's remedy implies that 
universities cannot invest in new 
enterprises.
It is not unusual for universities 
to invest in computer campanies
 Carnegie Mellon holds stock in 
IBM, DEC, SUN Microsystems, 
GRiD Systems, Compaq, AT&T, 
Unisys, Honeywell, Plexus 
Computers, Parallel Computers, 
Convex Computers, Apple, 
Floating Point Systems, Seagate, 
NCR, and Tandy as well as NeXT, 
Inc. Several of these companies are 
startup companies where Carnegie 
Mellon is part of a venture capital 
partnership (Plexus, Parallel 
Computers, Convex, Floating 
Point).
The NeXT investment may be 
controversial for Prof. Smith. This 
category of investment has not 
been controversial in the past, 
either for Carnegie Mellon or for 
universities like Stanford. It is not 
unusual for university officers to 
serve on the boards of corp
orations. President Cyert currently 
sits on the Boards of several 
corporations; I sit on one other 
corporate board. President Cyert 
and I decided that I would accept a 
position on the NeXT Board.
I would like to point out that 
NeXT is a company that has
Carnegie Mellon's vision of 
distributed, personal computing for 
research and education in 
universities. It is a vision that 
includes students, not just 
engineering and science faculty. 
NeXT has built a company totally 
dedicated to the Carnegie Mellon 
vision. As architects of that vision 
(which originated in our Computer 
Science Department in the late 
1970's) for higher education, it 
would be unusual for Carnegie 
Mellon not to, in some sense, 
provide a degree of support for a 
company that bases its future on 
our view of the world. We 
certainly have publicly and
financially supported other 
companies as investors and bh 
customers to the degree to which 
they agree with our vision  
IBM, DEC, Apple, SUN, and dM 
are the principal ones. And they 
have supported us. Adding b 
company totally dedicated to our 
vision to our list is hardly b 
suprising move.
Prof. Smith has correctly 
identified university-industrial 
relationships as issues worthy of 
scrutiny and constant concern. The 
usual concern is that industry 
distorts university interests and 
activities in undesirable ways. The 
continued on page 7Senior Banquet Had Planning Problems
The following is an open 
letter to the CMU community.
I would like to thank Mr. Lang, 
the Alumni Association, and all 
those responsible for holding the 
Senior Banquet at the Hyatt on the 
7th. It was an excellent 
opportunity to talk to class 
members rarely seen, and to enjoy 
some elegance in an otherwise 
wash-and-wear semester. Reading 
Ms. Biros' 17 February Tartan 
letter, however, I suppose I must 
have been in the dull section of the 
room. I didnt see any vomit. (I 
did see "Church of the Subgenius" 
stickers in the bathroom.) While I 
do not excuse those who drank too 
much, a little lack of sedateness 
was certainly to be expected. 
Dealing with overload or makeup 
courses, employment concerns, and 
general lack of sleep can definitely 
push the needle into the red zone 
without a chance to blow off 
steam. Add a spirit of camaraderie 
(and of being a survivor), and one 
would predict the banquet would be 
louder than a Kiwanis Club 
luncheon. I suggest that the 
actions of the organizers
exacerbated the situation. ,w
begin, eating time was short: oneand-a-quarter hours at most; it
seemed like less. At 8:15
everything was whisked away.
When I asked one of the managers
the reason for the hurry, she replied
the Alumni Association had
booked it that way. For some
reason, toasts were made during,
not before the meal, cutting further
into this time. (I have no idea why
students chanted "SATs! SATs!"
when President Denburg gave the
toast.) After-dinner entertainment
was actually during-dinner
entertainment. I think the singing
would have been more appropriate
in the Morewood Rec Room
Cabaret than at a dinner of this
size. Finally, I could not believe
my ears when Mr. Lang,
obviously annoyed by the lack wN
welcome for the toasts, bellowed,
"SHUT UP! JUST SHUT UP! 
This really made me feel like a
respected soon-to-be-alumnus.
Now that I think of it, this way wN
dealing with students can be seen
fairly often in an administration
that sidesteps relevant iwpiueph

Cuts in Financial Aid May Lower Tuition in U.S.
Editor:
RuiupBcg there has been b cwB of discussion 
euPbeyapP our government's proposed 
swyaNaibBawph to the federal student Napbpiabc 
aid programs. To better understand the 
eubhwph why the government has looked into 
itBBapP the programs, one must examine the 
uiwpwsai impact of such programs on the 
-eaiu of college tuitions. The fact that the 
government is providing such great 
bhhahBbpiu to students directly affects the 
-eaiu of a college education.
The level of academic excellence or 
extravagence that a student can pursue is 
related to the ability of a student to pay for 
that education. There is always some way to 
afford a college education. For example, 
some state colleges provide a high standard 
of education for a substantially lower cost 
than a private institution whose standard 
may be no higher. If one is unable to come

direction of influence is industry-touniversity. For the computing industry, 
Professor Smith has failed to notice that the 
direction of influence is university-toindustry, reflecting our overall strength in 
computing. Industry is helping Carnegie 
Mellon to meet its goals, not the reverse.
Time will tell if the NeXT investment 
proves to be a profitable one. As an 
investment, NeXT was evaluated by 
Carnegie Mellon according to well 
established procedures. The Investment 
Subcommittee of the Board of Trustees 
approved the investment in principal last 
June. Carnegie Mellon's, Stanfords, Ross 
Perot's, and Steve Jobs investments last 
month were treated identically in terms of 
stock price, ownership, and valuation. We 
had access to Ross Perot's and Stanford's 
"due diligence" evaluations. An independent 
assessment of market, business plan, and 
technology was made by Carnegie Mellon. 
The Carnegie Mellon Treasurer, as is usual 
in investments of this type, reviewed all 
aspects of the transaction. Although 
confidential, there was a thorough review of 
the investment before it was made. My 
membership on the Board gives the 
University additional protection.
Finally, let me address Prof. Smiths 
innuendos concerning my membership on 
the NeXT Board. There are no director's fees 
or any other form of direct financial 
compensation associated with my 
membership on the NeXT, Inc. Board, none 
has ever been discussed, and I have no 
knowledge of any plans for such fees. In fact 
in all my years of dealing with computer 
manufacturers  IBM, Apple, DEC, SUN, 
TI, AT&T, etc.  I have never taken a 
consulting fee, honorarium, or anything 
except expenses. NeXT will reimburse me 
for direct expenses (travel).
I take great exception to Prof. Smiths 
insinuations and unspecified "rumors" 
regarding my career plans, and unfounded 
speculations regarding motives. I particularly 
regret the style of conduct Prof. Smiths 
approach to issues and personalities 
encourages in our University. Prof. Smith 
has never, to my knowledge, attempted to 
contact me regarding anything, he has never 
talked to me, and could have no credible 
knowledge of my character and motivations. 
If only it were easy to create a sense of 
community as it is to tear it down.

up with the money for a four year education 
immediately, working part-time and going to 
night school for six years will give the

Students are more likely to take advantage of 
the educational opportunities offered by the 
school if they are providing their own 
tuition.
Since so many students feel that they are 
somehow entitled to unrestricted access to 
four-year colleges when attending school, the 
bleeding-heart liberals in Congress have
Editor:
FRATERNITY RAPED BY TARTAN. 
That is what the headlines should read this 
week on page one. In the February 17th 
issue of The Tartan, it was "erroneously" 
reported that a student was raped at the ATO 
Fraternity. Actually, it was irresponsibly 
reported, but trying to get the editors, in fact 
the very people responsible for it, to admit 
that is like trying to pick up a girl with a 
booger hanging out of your nose.
We are not trying to convince people that 
we are the greatest fraternity on campus or 
that the story itself was not newsworthy, but 
that it deserved more investigation and 
forethought before appearing in the form that 
it did.
Editor:
I was delighted to get a reply to my letter 
to the editor in the January 20 issue of The 
Tartan, especially one as ardent as Laurie 
Jackson's. Miss Jackson is absolutely right. 
I agree totally with almost everything she 
said. I was not aware that Carnegie Mellon 
is a white university. I'm not sure what 
that means, but she is right. Minorities from 
disadvantaged backgrounds might have a 
difficult time matriculating successfully. I 
agree with, too, that some (I think the 
correct work is not some but most. At 
Carnegie Mellon, anyway) minority students 
come from affluent backgrounds. Since most 
come from (may I use her word?) white 
backgrounds, I do have a little difficulty 
seeing the need to adjust to a white 
college, since they are already used to the 
white atmosphere. But Im white, so Ill 
take Miss Jacksons word for it.
Yes, minorities are human beings, people 
with goals, objectives, and abilities. Miss 
Jackson says minorities are not always 
treated as such at the university. Maybe I 
dont look up enough, but I have never seen 
a minority treated as anything but a human 
being with goals, objectives, and abilities. 
In fact, they are treated better than 1.1 don't 
have a whole complex on any floor of any 
building devoted solely to making my stay 
here at CMU a more comfortable one. Or 
maybe Miss Jackson doesnt count C-MAP 
as treating her human, since she is singled

pushed and succeeded in interfering with the 
education marketplace. College tuition costs 
have skyrocketed because the government 
has steadily increased aid to meet with these 
higher tuitions. In a new study, the 1980's 
have shown, per year a 9.8% increase in 
college tuitions, twice the rate of inflation 
(which averaged 4.9%), and notably faster 
than income (6.5% increase per year). 
Meanwhile, some students pay the full price 
of this government-instigated inefficiency.
A cut in government financial aid programs
There are several important shortcomings 
to the article in question and the issue of 
responsible journalism. First off, we believe 
that the article was printed purely on hearsay 
and that their "private source" was no more 
than a third party rumor, which was not 
substantiated through further investigation. 
Secondly, it is terribly pathetic that the 
editors did not consider the legal 
ramifications of such libelous text.
For that matter, why hasn't the 
administration taken a position during all 
this? They would be ultimately responsible 
if we decided to file a lawsuit against The 
Tartan, since it is the official newspaper of 
Carnegie Mellon. We haven't heard a word 
from them since the beginning. Lastly, it is
out simply because of the colour of her skin.
She is right again. C-MAP is not just a 
summer camp. I did slip and say it was only 
a summer camp. For that, I am profoundly 
sorry. But that was the only misinformation 
my letter contained.
Is Miss Jackson sure that C-MAP is not 
funded? Again, I will take her word for it.
I think I should point out to the reader that 
the summer program in addition to helping 
to prepare the participants for the rigorous 
freshman year here at CMU, is also 
mandatory for almost 80% of the incoming 
freshman minorities. What I mean by 
mandatory is that if they do not go to the 
camp, they do not go to the school. Because 
of the color of their skin. Miss Jackson may 
be among the lucky few who choose CMAP, but the majority of others were forced

will have beneficial effects on the price of 
tuition for students. Colleges will be forced 
to meet the actual abilities of students to pay 
for tuition, instead of having the government 
feed the money into the noncompetitive 
education marketplace, right into the tuition 
revenues of colleges. President Reagan and 
Secretary of Education William Bennett have 
demonstrated foresight in their initiatives 
with the financial aid program.

ironic, and perhaps amusing, that such an 
article would appear on the same page as an 
article about censorship in college 
newspapers. Now I can't see a need for that, 
...can you?
In conclusion, while censorship may be a 
bit drastic, we believe the administration has 
the responsibility to at least review the final 
copy, and that the editors should take it 
upon themselves to be responsible 
newspeople, even if they are not 
"professionals," in order to prevent such 
things from happening again.

into it
The only real problem I have with the 
letter is that while Miss Jackson says she is 
directly referring to my letter, she addresses 
none of the issues that I addressed. My letter 
was a comment on the silliness of racism, 
from the perspective of both blacks and 
whites. I merely used C-MAP as a vehicle 
with which to transport my ideas. I don't 
know if Miss Jackson missed the point of 
my letter, or merely chose to ignore it. 
Either way, I am sorry that she didn't get as 
much out of my letter as I attempted to put 
in. And I hope this letter helps clear up any 
ambiguities she or any other readers may 
have found.

Backstage on the set of Guiding Light
By BRUCE KASREL
Tartan Entertainment Editor 
Like millions of other Americans, I am 
addicted to soap operas. Ever since my 
freshman year in high school I have been 
glued to the television set between 3 and 4 
pm watching Guiding Light. I get a certain 
satisfaction out of watching all these 
seemingly perfect people mess up thier lives 
and then try, in vain, to put the pieces back 
together. Sociologists have come up with 
theories about why soaps are so popular; its 
escapism, or the characters represent what we 
aspire to be, or whatever. I dont really care
pictures of the various stars of the show 
hanging on the wall. I am in the right place. 
The Assistant to the Producers, Mary 
OLeary, welcomes me to the set As we 
walk back to her office, I pass the pictures of 
the current cast. A producer smiles as I walk 
by. Everyone seems so calm, not like I 
expected from a show that puts out over 250 
shows a year. Where are all the frantic 
writers or the horde of production people all 
trying to meet a last minute deadline. There 
are no actors screaming for script changes, 
everybody is going about their work as 
usual. Must have known I was coming,
Jonny Bauer (James Goodwin)
why I watch them, just as long as I get my 
daily fix of the goings on in Springfield, 
U.S.A. As entertainment editor I have had 
the chance to do a lot of exciting things, 
and my visit to the set of Guiding Light was 
one of the most enjoyable so far.
Located in the garment district in New 
York (how else do you think they get all 
those silly outfits), the studio looks more 
like a warehouse for Macys than home to 
the glamorous sets that make up the show. 
There is no Guiding Light sign (scare 
fanatical housewives away , I guess) and if I 
had not noticed the tiny CBS logo on the 
side I might have walked right on by. The 
plain reception desk still gives no sign that I 
am in the right place. I announce who I am, 
and am instructed to go down a hallway. 
Upon reaching the end of the hallway, there 
are covers of soap opera magazines with the
downstairs rehearsal room with the director. 
Here they iron out any problems they may 
have with the dialogue. Revisions in the 
script are made and the crew heads back 
upstairs to the set. There are no teleprompt
ers, so the actors are required to know all 
their lines as soon as the arrive.
Next the action in the scene is blocked out 
for shooting: where the actors are supposed 
to move, what camera will follow which 
actor, and what their cues may be. The actors 
go through a dry run through, while the 
director and producer watch from the control 
room. After the actors finish the scene, the 
director confers with the producer. The 
producer, who has the final say, points out 
any inconsistencies in the dialogue, missed 
lines, or unacceptable improvisations by the 
actors. The actors are again instructed by the 
director and the scene is done once again for 
final taping.
Inside the control booth, the director is 
faced with the task of juggling three camera 
angles in each scene. He barks out the 
camera numbers ONE.. THREE... ONE... at 
a dizzying pace. Hands waiving wildly, he 
looks like he should be conducting an 
orchestra. While the director snaps out his 
commands, the assistant director talks to the 
cameramen via earphones, and tells them to 
get ready or change position. Its quite a 
sight If the producer has no complaints, the 
tape is marked ami ready to go.
Like most soaps, Guiding Light films all 
the scenes on a particular set all at once. 
Although this saves a great deal of time, 
money, and studio space, it does not allow 
for major changes in the show. In fact, the 
day I was there it caused quite a problem.
The first shoot of the day involved a very 
dramatic fight scene between Jonny Bauer 
(James Goodwin) and Paul Valere (Robin
Ward) for the love of Valeres wife, 
Christine (Ariana Munker). The fight 
consultant had carefully choreographed the 
entire bout and everything went smoothly in 
the dry run. However, when it came time for 
the final taping, Goodwin accidentally 
connected with a crushing right cross, 
sending Ward down for the count Although 
he was not seriously hurt, only a chipped 
tooth and a bloody lip, it presented a 
problem for the director. The next set of 
scenes with Ward are supposed to take place 
before the fight It was rather comical to 
watch director Bruce Barry struggle over the 
right camera angle that would not show the 
rather large welt on Wards face. The 
makeup department was called in, and all 
went rather well. The make up was taken off 
for the next scene which takes place after the 
fight
After the shooting for the day is complete, 
the final tape is taken down to the editing 
room. Since most of the tape is in its final 
form  with music and sound effects  the 
editors basically piece the show back 
together. However if there is a problem with 
timing or a glitch in the tape, the editor will 
work with the assistant director the fix the 
problem.
There are no re-runs in daytime drama, so 
the entire process is repeated again the next 
day. This time with a new script, new 
director, and new sets. There are five different 
directors and each directs a different episode. 
A director can work on a maximum of two 
shows a week. Also, there is a different 
dialogue writer each show while the head 
writer dreams up the situations for each 
character.
These are not the most ideal conditions for 
the actors to develop the characters of
probably not
As she begins to take me onto the set, 
OLeary explains the taping schedule. Actors 
come in two shifts: the morning crew arrive 
at 7 am and usually leave around 3 pm, and 
the afternoon/evening group go from 3 pm 
to as late as it takes (sometimes as late 4 
oclock in the morning). Each day an hour 
epsiode must be completed even though they 
shoot five days ahead of schedule.
There are two main studios, 51 and 54. 
The downstairs studio, the morning shoot, 
holds five or sue sets, while the upstairs 
studio, the afternoon set, holds three or four. 
The sets are put up and tom down as they are 
needed. There are no sets which stay up all 
the time. The stage crew is working 
practically around the clock to keep things 
going.
As soon as the actors arrive, they go to aIndia von Halkien (Mary Kay Adams)

Pittsburgh Symphony announces 1987-88 season
PITTSBURGH The subscription concert 
schedule of conductors, soloists and pro
grams for the Pittsburgh Symphony's 1987- 
88 season was announced today by the 
Orchestra's Vice President and Managing 
Director Marshall W. Turkin.
"Under the artistic leadership of our music 
director-designate Loriri Maazel, our 24-week 
subscription season in Heinz Hall will cover 
an exciting spectrum of music encompassing 
many of the greatest symphonic works from 
the repertoire. And, to interpret the musical 
masterpieces we are offering one of the finest 
rosters of distinguished conductors and illus
trious performers anywhere, declared 
Turkin.
Season Highlights
Lorin Maazel, who will become the 
Orchestra's Music Director in September of 
1988, will be on the podium for four weeks 
of subscription concerts. Maestro Maazel's 
programs include four Pittsburgh Symphony 
premieres: Geminiani's Concerto grosso in 
G minor, Opus 3, No. 2; George Rochberg's 
Symphony No. 6; William Schuman's On 
Freedom Ground; and Nielson's Flute 
Concerto with James Galway as soloist for 
the Nielson selection.
Maestro Maazel will also conduct perform
ances of Bruckner's Symphony No. 3, Stra
vinsky's Rite of Spring, and Mahler's Sym
phony No. 4, among other works during his 
1987-88 subscription concert appearances.
Among the 13 works scheduled for first 
performances before Pittsburgh Symphony 
subscription audiences are Roberto Sierra's 
Jubilee Overture, Rodin Shchedrin's 
Mischievous Melodies, Mussorgskys Dawn 
Over the Moscow River, from Khovanshchina. Dahl's Hymn, Bax's The Garden of 
Fand, Janacek's Glagolitic Mass, Cage's The
Seasons, Chinary Ung's Inner Visions and 
Shostakovich's Piano Concerto No. 2.
The first four of Mahler's symphonies will 
be presented during 1987-88 as part of a 
performance cycle of works by this musical 
giant. The season also offers symphonies 
No. 1, 4, and 15 by Shostakovich and

A poem for Forbes Gallery
By CHRIS CORRIGAN
Special to the Tartan 
This week's show at the Forbes Gallery 
will feature works by Stephanie Ashton 
and Sue Caralonza. Both Sue and Steph 
requested that instead of talking about 
their work, I just put in a poem.
At the Swamp Monsters Party 
for the "Grapes"
The swamp monsters 
were rollin and a tumblin 
rockin' and bumblm' 
the night away
and stumblin into the next day 
at the swamp monsters' party.
While the crocodiles 
were snappin and clappin 
rappin' to the rock steady beat 
tappin' away on their scaley feet
at the swamp monsters party.
And the snakes 
were janglin' and hanglin' 
down bouncin' around 
drinkin' wine tanglin' it up 
feelin' fine and slimey 
at the swamp monsters party.
And we were
dancin' and prancin' around 
glancin' at the sounds 
glad that we found our way 
to the swamp monsters' party.
The show runs from Tuesday, March 3 
through Sunday, March 8. There is an 
opening reception Tuesday night from 
7:00pm to 9:00pm. Refreshments will 
be served and the public is invited.

Behind the scenes 
of Guiding Light
continued from page D1
their screen personas. The changing 
environment in which the actors work often 
causes their characters to change dramatically 
in a matter of weeks. For example, India 
von Halkein (Mary Kay Adams) came to the 
show in 1984 as the shows main bitch. 
Always up to something, it seemed that 
there was no salvation for India. Somehow 
the writers found a way, and now she is a 
rather wishy-washy good gal. The actors 
should be commended to be able to adapt as 
naturally as they do.
After spending a few hours on the set, I 
could see just how much work putting 
together a soap can be. It takes a great deal 
of teamwork, cooperation, and talent to put 
out a show every day. Although it may 
seem all glamour and luxury on the surface, 
putting together a daytime drama is hard 
work as well as an art; which few shows 
have mastered as well as Guiding Light.
More free stuff from Ask Bruce
It has been two weeks since Ask Bruce 
hit the newsstands, and guess how many 
questions I got. One. Its much better 
than none, but come on guys, you can do 
better than that? Maybe youll send in a 
question when you see how much Hershel 
Markovitz gets for just asking one simple 
little question. For his efforts, he will 
receive a free King Kong Lives T-Shirt, a 
Labyrinth picture book, and a Columbia 
Jazz Sampler record album. Not bad, huh? 
Well, here is the question:
One of the credits listed at the end of a 
movie is Best Boy. What is his job?
Hershel Markovitz, Chemistry, MI 825
A best boy is the electricians assistant. 
His job is usually to wire up the set for 
the days shooting. Thanks Hershel for a 
good question, Ill be contacting you 
about your prizes.
Thanks should also go to all those 
people who responded to last weeks trivia 
question. Woody Allen plays the clarinet. 
Before I go any further, I must correct a 
few errors in last weeks column.
Paul Newman was not nominated in 
1959 or 1960 as I stated. He was 
nominated in 1958 for Cat on a Hot Tin 
Roof and David Niven won for Separate 
Tables. He was nominated for Cool Hand 
Luke in 1967, but Rod Steiger won for In 
the Heat of the Night.
And now for this weeks trivia question:
What famous Hollywood direc
tor owns the sled used in Citizen 
Kane?
The prize this week will be a Labyrinth 
Picture book. Hurry, supplies are limited.
Remember, if you have a question for 
me, send it to: Ask Bruce c/o The Tartan.
Its dev'eri p.m. Do you know where your paper is?
Apple am (*r Apple lofo npum mrmmHa o/AppU Comfmltr. Im macinio* tt  tntkmm* o/Appf LompuHr ImDowJom**^M^umrnumtm+mt*ofDom/om,tCompmy.lm mmmflu,r^utrrnt>rmnm^o/mcfrm,fCo>ponlM
Lets be real. Compare the equipment shes using to yours. If you 
were both trying to tunnel through a mountain, shed have a bulldozer 
and youd have a shrimp fork.
Dont despair. Your problem is already half-solved. For a limited 
time, you can buy an Apple Macintosh Plus or a Macintosh 512K 
Enhanced computer with Microsoft Worksfor less money
Which is wonderful.
You get a Macintosh, with its speed, ease of use, and graphics 
capability: Plus, you get a software program that lets you use all this 
Macintosh power in all your subjects.
Microsoft Works is not just one program, its four integrated pro
grams: word processing, data-base management, spreadsheet with 
charting, and communications.
Meaning you can put charts in your history' essays. Spreadsheets in 
your economics papers. Call Dowjones News/Retrieval at 2:00 a.m. to 
get the facts for your journalism story due at 8:00 a.m.
So if youre taking more than one subject this semester, you should 
check out Macintosh and Microsoft Works.
But dont wait till the eleventh hour. This offer will end soon.
And your paper might stay out all night.

When You Give Blood, 
You Give Life.

Blood is also medicine's most precious commodity. When you give 
blood, you are helping four different people, because blood can be 
separated into four different life-saving products:
red blood cells for use during surgery,
platelets for treatment of leukemia and cancer patients,
fresh frozen plasma for treatment of bum patients and people with 
coagulation illnesses,
and cryoprecipitate for treatment of hemophiliacs.
Your blood is urgently needed. It can't be manufactured, it must come from you. The need for blood 
in Pittsburgh is twice the national average, yet the number of eligible donors here has dropped by 32,755 
since 1983. To make up the difference, the Central Blood Bank of Pittsburgh must collect 32,000 more 
donations than it did last year. Otherwise, health care in Pittsburgh could be in serious jeopardy.
Please make your blood donation on Monday, March 16 anytime from 9:30am to 
3:00pm in the Wherret Room in Skibo.

Somewhere Different to Shop: Oxford Centre
mg KEI KURITA
Tartan Staffwriter
So gwtveu bored one Saturday afternoon and 
you decide to go shopping. But you dont 
feel like sitting for an hour on a 
bus for the long trek to 
EwpewuAaccu? youre sick of 
Kaufmanns, and you went to 
oBbBawp Square last week. So 
what's cuNB?
One Oxford Centre.
Admittedly, this place is niceI 
don't know of any other place in 
Pittsburgh where you can find a 
collection of classy shops,
boutiques, and restaurants like 
this. This is not a place for 
teenagers clad in black leather 
jackets to hang outno game 
rooms and pizzerias here. The 
customers primarily consist of 
Pittsburghs most affluent 
citizensthey have to be; the 
Centre sells merchandise by 
Gucci, Maud Frizon, Ralph
Lauren, Bally, Perry Ellis, Joan &
David, just to name a few. The 
only shop high school students 
might step a foot in would be 
Benetton.
But that doesn't mean this will 
be your idea of a shopping
paradise.
Along with these luxurious
items are the salespeople who try 
to promote them. Some of them arc 
amiable. When my friend and I entered the
Polo/Ralph Lauren Shop, the saleslady asked 
courteously, May I help you with 
something? but I said, as all browsers do, 
We're just looking, thanks. Realizing that
Illustration by Kurt Shaw
we didn't have intentions to buy anything, she 
smiled and left us alone to allow us to browse some
more.
Frankly, thats what we all expect when we 
go shopping, isn't it? Salespeople understand 
that people like to browse and windowshop; 
that's how their items are bought in 
the first placehow can anyone buy 
anything in a store that he isnt 
allowed to enter? We're potential 
customers. But some of the 
salespeople at the Centre fail to 
realize this.
When we were in Jaz, for example, 
the saleslady ignored us completely. 
Just when we were about to walk 
out, she casually says (as if she had 
just noticed us), May I help you? 
The stares the saleslady gave were 
uncomfortable and felt as if she had 
said to us: Obviously, you don't 
belong here, you dont look like 
you're going to buy anything, so 
please leave before you drive the 
other customers away. God forgive 
my friend, die was wearing sneakers.
No one wants to be scrutinized 
when shopping. Not only are they 
being rude to potential customers, 
but it's done totally unjustly. Even 
the salespeople in New York City 
arent half as snobbyand if they 
were snobby, at least they have the 
right to be. The stares there are the 
most prestigious and expensive in 
the worldit's understandable, it's 
expected
But not here. Here, they make it a

Club Spotlight: The Chinese Student Organization
By IRENE KAO
Tartan Staffwriter
Although the Chinese Student Organ
ization (CSO) was only founded in 1983, 
this club has prospered and grown 
tremendously. The new officers consist of all 
sophomores and freshmen, so new ideas and 
activities are being planned. These new 
officers consist of: Calvin Seto (president), 
Hugo Cheng (vice-president), Paul Sun 
(treasurer), Lisa Hwang (secretary), Bernard 
Feng (activities chairperson) and Sam Liu 
(public relations chairperson). Rather than 
emphasizing the Chinese culture, CSO is 
more of a social organization. Calvin Seto, 
the president of the organization, explains 
the purpose of this club, CSO provides the 
opportunity for minority students of Asian 
persuasion to meet and better acquaint 
themselves with other students of a common 
nationality. 
First, a brief history describing this club. 
In 1983, Herman Heung thought of an idea 
for an organization that would bring the 
Chinese students together. Together with 
Stan Yee, Herman founded the very first 
Chinese organization, Asian Cultural 
Organization (ACO) at Camegie-Mellon. 
Despite some struggling at the beginning, 
Stan Yee, the first president of ACO (1983- 
1985) managed to pull the organization 
through.
Before Stan resigned his presidency, he and 
the members of ACO decided to change the 
name to its present name, the Chinese 
Student Organization in order to attract more 
members. As a result, during Brian Hu's 
presidency (1985-1987), there were more 
freshman Chinese students, so more people 
joined, and the enthusiasm among the 
members increased.
Starting last year, the interest in promoting 
the Chinese culture has resurfaced. The 
annual Lion Dance celebrates the age-old 
tradition during Chinese New Year. For the 
past two or three years. CSO sponsors two
parties reflecting the Chinese culture: one in 
the fall (Moon Festival) and the Chinese 
New Year's Party in the spring.
The recent showing of the movie Outland 
gave CSO a chance to raise extra money. 
Now, with more money in the treasury, the 
officers plan to have more social activitites. 
Just this past weekend, the organization 
along with Carnegie Mellon's Korean 
Student Association (KSA) went to Hidden 
Valley for a day of skiing.
Also, CSO members have been active as a 
group in intramural sports; so far, they have 
participated in football, tennis, basketball, 
softball, and bowling. Next semester, Calvin
would like to show a Chinese movie that 
would be unique to the Carnegie Mellon 
campus and is also planning to have a booth 
on Midway during Spring Carnival 88.
The big project for now is CSO t-shirts 
and sweatshirts. Hugo Cheng, also a graphic 
design major, drew the new CSO logo which 
will be in the front of the t-shirt and 
sweatshirt. On the back, there will be a 
dragon emblem.
CSO encourages other students with 
interests in having fun and being with 
Chinese students to attend the meetings. 
CSO usually meets every other Thursday at 
5:0() pm in Skibo Room 12.

Want the best view of Downtown 
Pittsburgh? Just want to get away from 
the University? Have I gotta deal for 
you!
Mount Washington is the area that is 
on the cliff that faces the south side of 
downtown. The Monongahela Incline at 
Station Square will take you up there for 
the low price of only sixty cents.
Once you go up to Mount Washinton 
there are a few observation decks and 
you can look over the city.
A recommendation is to go at night 
because the lights of the city really 
make a beautiful sight 
How to get there? Simple, grab any of 
the buses going down Forbes Avenue 
and get off at Kaufmanns. Any of the 
buses that are running towards Station 
Square will get you to Station Square. 
The Incline itself is behind Station 
Square running up the side of the 
mountain. Round-trip costs $1.20 and 
you pay at the top so be ready once you 
get off.

One Does Origami; the Other RunsWarren Lehew
By ANDREW ROBITSHEK
Tartan Business Manager
When I walked into Warren's room he 
offered me a standard dorm room greeting. 
Sit down, pull up a chair or sit on a pile of 
clothes. I chose to sit on the floor next to a 
blanket The blanket on the floor looked out 
of place, but Warren went on to explain that 
he napped on the floor and slept in his bed. 
The floor is more comfortable, he stated.
Warren likes Carnegie Mellon, though he 
does have a few complaints. At other 
schools everyone is always smiling and is 
made welcome. There is too much pressure 
here. This is a degree factory where everyone 
worries about grades. He also doesn't like 
the new rebuilding plans. He prefers old 
buildings that blend into the background to 
die new ones that stick out because they are 
different from all the other buildings.
As we talked he protested my questions 
about his being unusual. He said that he 
wasn't weird, but pretended to be. It keeps 
people on top of things. Though anyone 
who writes letters to his cat at home may 
not be all there,
Warren is a senior physics major who has 
just begun to search for a job; a little late he 
admits. He is willing to attend graduate 
school, assuming he can get someone to pay 
his way. We talked about his courses for a 
while, and as he was explaining some of his 
bizarre physics courses (bizarre to me, at 
least), he mentioned his film class which he 
finds highly enjoyable. Warren recommended 
it to everyone.
He feels he should devote more time to his 
studies, since he allocates a sizable portion 
of his time on more important things, like 
drinking, coffee or beer, or going for walks 
(because his bike was stolen). After buying a 
book about origami, the oriental art of paper
folding, he has made many frogs, fish and 
other assorted wildlife. Last summer he 
worked for housing where he did all sorts of 
maintenance work and had his favorite 
sandwich at lunchtime; tuna fish, peanutbutter, baked beans, Cheez Whiz and Miracle 
Whip on a pita. He claims it is very high in 
.protein.
While many people have started making 
their spring break plans, Warren has not 
really thought about them yet. He made it to 
Florida last year, four people in a small 
Toyota and a tent, where they camped out
John Fix
By LIZ SHERLOCK
Tartan Staffwriter
What is the average Carnegie Mellon 
student like? It's pretty difficult to describe 
one person who typifies such a diverse 
population. Although he is far from average, 
John Fix may be considered very close to the 
idea of the typical Carnegie Mellon student 
(I'm sure that if he could hear me say this 
his dry humor would provide him with some 
snappy response that would leave me 
striving for a decent comeback).
John is a senior Mechanical Engineering
along the way. They made it to the beaches 
of Daytona, Disneyland, A cool place to 
go, Warren commented, and finally St 
Petersburg.
Warren started explaining about when he 
drinks and how he acts,I try not to do stupid 
things where people laugh at youpeople 
respect me for this; [though] once in a while
I get out of hand.
As I left him, he continued to write his 
letter to Oscar his cat back home.
major. He has done well in his nearly four 
years, here, but he never seems to fall into 
that geek mode that has been known to 
take over many an engineer's work-loaded 
life. In high school, John was very good in 
track, but when he got to college he did not 
join the team. He thought that he would 
have to concentrate on his studies. Well, that 
was enough of that; when John returned to 
school in his sophomore year he started 
running track again. In fact, even when he's
not in training John keeps active, running 
and biking very seriously.
My depiction of John is sounding very 
intense, but that is not the impression that 
he gives. John is constantly goofing off and 
cracking jokes. When talking with him, its 
best to be armed and ready for his quick 
sarcasm and opinionated manner to show 
themselves. It's hard to take him seriously 
much of the time. It is not easy to tell when 
he is kidding and when he really means what 
he says. Still, there is another side to Fix. 
Through all of his humor, a friend of John's 
still knows he can depend on him if he really 
needs him. John can be very compasssionate 
if he senses that that is what his friend 
needs. He will help in any way he can (espe
cially if that means partying to forget those 
problems that are getting him and his friends 
down!).
So, now that John is a senior and he's 
almost done with his college career, what are 
his plans? A smile creeps across his face as 
Im lured into his nonsensical way of think
ing. It's an undeniable I don't know. At the 
age of twenty-one we would think that John 
would have his life laid out in front of him, 
but he's just plugging through school, as 
always. It would seem that his devil-maycare attitude toward his future after 
graduation would be grating on the nerves, 
but it is far from that It is refreshing. He 
has learned to balance his difficult workload, 
his fitness regime, and his craving for 
silliness quite well.
Maybe we can all take a lesson from John 
and realize that life doesn't have to be all 
work. It is possible to have some fun along 
the way. Oh, just one more thing, John; I 
have to ask you: are you ever going to grow 
up? Oh, God. I hope not! Well, touche, 
ask a silly question...
Many people find that joining aCoping with school and personal problems isn't easy, 
group at the Counseling Center can be helpful.

InsidetheLink
By DAVID LEWIS
Special To The Tartan 
With representatives elected from 
students in each college, Student Senate 
operates to safeguard and promote the 
welfare of the university community, to 
disburse Activities Fee funds to funded 
organizations, to provide a liaison 
between students and the administration, 
and to inform the student body of 
proposals and changes in academic policy. 
To be able to succeed as an effective 
student governing body, we have formed 
four Standing Internal Committees.
Academic Affairs
The Academic Affairs committee, 
chaired by Norman Larson, deals with 
matters of academic life at Carnegie 
Mellon. It is presently looking into the 
Faculty Course Evaluations and the 
quality of teaching.
Campus Affairs
The Campus Affairs committee is 
chaired by Glenn Kombrek. It is 
concerned with conditions on campus. It 
is has addressed issues such as the traffic 
problem on Margaret Morrison and Tech 
Streets and the chemicals used in the 
studios in the Doherty Hall basements.
Funding and Recognition
The chairman of the Funding and 
Recognition committee is Tamal 
Mukheijee. Funding and Recognition 
is responsible for recognizing student 
organizations. In addition, it deter
mines whether an organization is 
eligible for funding and works with 
the organization to determine their 
annual budget
Public Relations and Human 
Resources
The Public Relations and Human 
Resources committee is chaired by 
Nadine Flynn. It is responsible for 
publicizing Student Senate and 
developing the human resources of 
Senate. This committee organizes the 
Senate Happy Hours and provides the 
advertising seen in The Tartan and 
around campus.
Each Senator also holds office hours 
in the Senate Office, Skibo 59. If you 
have any suggestions or questions 
about Student Senate or about life at 
Carnegie Mellon, feel free to stop by.
Watch for Inside The Link each week 
in the Tartan, as we go into more 
detail about the people behind Student 
Senate. In addition, Senate meets 
every Tuesday at 7:00 PM in the 
Wherret Room. Everyone is welcome.

Shopping at Oxford Centre

privilege to walk in and touch something by 
Fendi. Does that mean that the salespeople 
and their esoteric customers are the only 
ones with this great gift? Does that mean 
that college students cant browse? That 
were too broke to be potential customers? 
This is ignorance at its best. These are the 
thoughts of the citizens erf a city where, up 
until last year, had only two Benetton stores, 
and now has become the biggest thing next 
to Guess jeans to teenagers. Everyone likes 
to go through nice stores, but no one needs 
this nasty attitude, especially when it isn't 
deserved.
Even the name is ostentatious: One Oxford 
Centre. What is it supposed to signify with 
the British way of spelling Center, a place 
for the sophisticated high-class?
Other than these points, One Oxford Centre 
is a very nice place to go shoppingbut 
only if you ignore the salespeople and their 
stares.
To get to the Centre, take any 61 bus (A,

Men's and Women's Basketball and 
Swimming. Within the week, Fencing and 
Ice Hockey will finish up their seasons. 
After that, there will be no Tartan Sports 
activity until April. Most of the teamshave enjoyed successful seasons, and perhaps 
a lot of this is due to the support of their 
fans, we, the students at CMU. In order to 
keep up this fan support, here is a brief list 
of the upcoming Tartan Sports, and the dates 
of their first few games.

6-2. But 1:08 later, Carnegie Mellon began a 
stretch in which they scored twice in 9 
seconds and a third goal just 2 minutes later.
Hudson, Wise, native Merchak went first, 
backhanding a Nogrady pass which was 
behind him past Hawk to make it 7-2. 
Junior D Sean McGinn, the third tri-captain, 
was also credited with an assist. For 
McGinn, the assist extended his scoring 
streak to 5 consecutive games (2 goals and 5 
assists during the stretch).
Then came Nogrady's first goal, at 9:56. 
Junior forward John Blackwood won the 
faceoff after Merchak's tally, freshman D 
Robson put the puck on Nogrady's stick, and 
the junior from Pittsburgh beat Hawk to the 
stick side. For Robson, who hails from 
Amson, Conn., it was his first collegiate 
point
Galvin was last in the stretch, although not 
in the game. While Merchak served his 
second roughing minor of the contest, 
Galvin took the puck from D Mark Licata 
behind the Tartan net, and went coast-tocoast, beating 3 Rock defenders and the 
goaltender Hawk for his 6th goal of the year.
Slippery Rock's Mike Rankin added an 
unassisted goal at 13:39, and Nogrady closed 
out all the scoring, off an excellent pass 
from senior LW Tom Hughes, with only 47 
seconds left. It was Hughes first career 
assist, and Licata also picked one up on the 
play.
The easy victory gave the Tartans an added 
psychological edge. "I was scared about the 
Slippery Rock game. I thought they'd be 
scrappy like the last time, and I thought wed 
be too cocky, Henderson remarked.
McGuire agreed "This game was a good 
game to start the playoffs with. We played 
well Saturday against Duquesne but we didnt 
win. We played even better against Slippery 
Rock, and we came up big. We're starting to 
break out of the slump."
Carnegie Mellon didn't get past the first 
round in last year's playoffs, losing to the 
Dukes, 5-2. In Thursdays second round 
clash with Gannon, the Tartans will face a 
team they haven't beaten since 1981.
"The lines need to work well together lilce 
they did Sunday," added McGinn. "We need 
to stay in our lanes, set up our plays, and 
play good position hockey so we can beat 
Gannon to the puck. The Civic Centei 
[Gannons home ice] is a larger rink, and 
theres a lot more room to skate. We have 
to make that work to our advantage in order 
to beat the Knights."
If the Tartans get by Gannon, they'll 
probably face Duquesne a third time, in the 
WPCHA championship game this Sunday at 
Lakevue Ice Palace at 5:00 p.m. Saturday's 
matchup was a very physical one, with over 
40 minutes in penalties handed out, and 
McGinn expects and hopes for the same.
"Hockey's not a gentleman's sport But 
when the Tartans play good, agressive 
hockey we usually win."
Tartan Tattlers - It was uncertain at press 
time whether WRCT would cover Thursday 
night's Gannon game; listen to Sportsline 
tonight at 8:30 for details - WRCT will 
cover the championship game Sunday if the 
Tartans are in it; tune in for the pregame at 
4:50 p.m. - Greg Timmons and Mark Licata 
suffered bruised thighs in separate incidents 
over the weekend but neither missed very 
much ice time and should be 100% for 
Thursday - Due to Licatas injury, Mark 
Robson received more ice time at left defense 
Sunday and played his best game as a Tartan -
Despite giving up 18 goals in his last 4 
regular season games, goalie John Kerber 
finished the season with a 3.19 goals against 
average, 3rd best in the league - Tartan head 
coach Bob Koch, a Carnegie Mellon 
alumnus, is now 0-2 lifetime against 
Duquesne, coached by older brother Jim.

Three Hoopsters Named to PAC All - Conference Teams
By DON GAMBLE
Tartan Sports Editor 
With the closing of the Tartans Basketball 
hubhwp this past week came the naming of 
Blu All-Conference Teams in the President's 
Athletic Conference. Despite a slow year for 
Blu Tartans, three players managed to give an 
excellent showing, and in turn were rewarded 
kg being named to the All-Conference 
Teams. Seniors Pete Cwalina and David 
Bart, along with Junior Hart Coleman were 
elected to the First and Second AllConference teams by league coaches.
Spring Training Report
Pirates Strong
By JOHN FRIEDMANN
Tartan Contributing Editor 
BRADENTON (FLA) - The countdown has 
kuPtp on a new, hopefully brighter, year of 
MaebBu baseball. The Bucs, cellar-dwellers for 
Blu last three seasons, have opened spring 
BebapapP with the feeling that this could be 
Blu year that the Pirates are again 
competitive in the National League EbhBI
Spring training 1987 is also the coming 
wtB for many new faces. Of the players on 
cbhB spring's 40-man roster, only 23 remain. 
Gwpu are veterans like Rick Rhoden and 
oBuAu Kemp, replaced by younger faces like 
Hipolito Pena and Barry Bonds. In fact, only
6 Pirates on the roster are over 30 years old.
Unlike last year, much more of the team is 
huBI Spring training '86 saw the Pirates solid 
only at catcher and second base. This year, 
Blu infield is pretty much set. Once again, 
catcher Tony Pena and 2B Johnny Ray are 
Blu anchors. Sid Bream earned the first base 
jwk? while Jim Morrison turned in his best 
gube ever in his first as a starting third 
baseman. The only quasi-question mark is 
shortstop Rafael Belliard, who holds the job 
only due to his superior fielding.
The outfield is a much different story. 
Rookie Barry Bonds has won the centerfield 
job, but filling the other two spots awaits 
the answers to several questions. Will Joe 
Orsulak rebound from his sophomore slump 
last season? Are Mike Diaz's defensive skills 
trustworthy enough to let him play 
regularly? Can R.J. Reynolds rebound and 
can Mike Brown hit consistently?
But what is most important for the Pirate's 
improvement? General Manager Syd Thrift 
came straight to the point
"Pitching. That's what makes or breaks 
anybody's ballclub. The bullpen is critical. 
You have to have good defense and pitching 
is a main cog of defense."
But aside from veteran hurler Rick 
Reuschel, the starting rotation is wide open.
"You've got Kipper, Dravek, 
Paterson...Larry McWilliams might be there 
we Bob Walk. We've got 14 guys for 10
Cwalina, in his final season, led the league 
in rebounds, with 10.5 per game, and carried 
an impressive scoring record of 14.3 points 
per game, to make him 10th in the league 
and 2nd in the PAC in scoring. The 6'6" 
forward ends his career with the Tartans with 
533 points and 407 rebounds. He held careerhigh scoring this season in two Carnegie 
Mellon victories, each with 27 points for the 
Senior. Cwalina was named to the PAC's 
First All-Conference Team.
Bart, also in his last season, was chosen 
for the Second Team. Despite a foot injury
Optimistic Fo
positions," said GM Thrift.
In the bullpen, Don Robinson proved an 
effective closer during the second half of last 
season, and Brian Fisher, newly acquired 
from the Yankees, can do the same. But both 
are righthanders, leaving Manager Jim 
Leyland a choice among lefties Bob Kipper, 
Hipolito Pena, John Smiley, Bob Patterson 
and Larry McWilliams. Of those five, only 
Smiley and Patterson have experience as 
short relievers.
Thrift thinks last year's hurlers have 
improved themselves.
"Same names, different people. We have 
the best instructional program in all of 
baseball. The best teachers, the best coaches. 
Not second best. The best. Period."
*****
Although not a product of the Pirate farm 
system, Sid Bream is one of the success 
stories on the Bucs. Acquired from Los 
Angeles in the Bill Madlock trade late in
1985, Bream won the starting first base job 
last season. Bream has enjoyed the switch 
from the Dodgers.
"With the Pirates last year, I had more fun, 
even though we had such a bad record, than I 
ever had in a Dodger uniform. I think there's 
a lot less pressure, you can go out and have 
fun, and I think your performance will show 
when you are not being pressured," 
commented Bream.
The pressure was definitely on when Bream 
was in Los Angeles. The Dodgers made 
Bream their starting first baseman in 1985 
after he hit over .400 in spring training. But 
Bream never found his batting stroke with 
the Dodgers, and shuttled between LA and 
the Pacific Coast League before he was dealt 
east late in the season.
He found his batting stroke last season, his 
first full year in the major leagues. He hit 
.268 with 77 runs batted in and 16 homers. 
But the home run total might increase this 
year, thanks to an offseason condidtioning 
program.

which kept him out of six games this 
season, the Senior led the Tartans in scoring 
with 16.3 points per game, ranking him 4th 
in the PAC. Bart hit 49% from the floor this 
season, third best on the team. Bart, a 6'0" 
guard from Hartsdale, New York, ends his 
Tartan career with 598 points, 233 rebounds, 
and 170 assists. His career-high score came 
this season with 26 points, in a loss to 
Marietta College.
This year marks the third straight year for 
Hart Coleman's naming to All-Conference 
Second Team. Another injury victim, with a
r New Season
is there. I know I have the power to hit the 
homerun."
Although Bream was tied for second on the 
team in homers, his total was still low for a 
player usually hitting in the "cleanup spot" 
in the batting order.
"I'm more of a fifth or sixth hitter...But 
I've hit fourth all my life, and I don't mind 
hitting fourth, but if things could happen 
out where I could go down to fifth or sixth, 
that wouldn't bother me at all," Bream said.
Despite the good season he had in 1986, 
Sid Bream knows he has to perform again in 
1987. "If I dont go out and have a good year 
this year, my chances for the next year are 
gone."
*****
One of the few over-thirty players in camp, 
pitcher Larry McWilliams is hoping to 
regain his spot in the starting rotation after 
having the worst season of his career in
1986. The 33 year-old forkballer was 3-11 
with a 5.15 ERA last year, 1-8 as a starter.
"What started the decline was that I hurt 
my arm in '85, and I wanted to come back 
and be airing it out and really throwing gas. 
Doing that I hurt my control, and control is 
more important than velocity anyway. It's 
one of those mistakes even a veteran pitcher 
makes."
Despite finishing last season as a long 
reliever for the Pirates, McWilliams does not 
feel confined to that role. "I think I can still 
start, and start effectively. It's a matter of 
getting myself together."
But he is willing to be flexible, knowing 
his situation as a veteran on a team 
promoting youth. "If I do well in relief, I'll 
be happy with that because I'll be in the 
games more. If I do poorly, who knows?"
With all the young arms General Manager 
Syd Thrift is touting, McWilliams' role in 
the club is in question. He could be a starter, 
long reliever, or even a lefthanded closer. 
What his role is this season depends to a 
large extent on what he does this spring. *****
Logan Easley is in his first spring training
broken foot February 4th at John Carroll, 
Coleman ranked sixth in the PAC for 
scoring and seventh in rebounds. The junior 
center led the Tartans in blocked shots and 
slam dunks, with 56 and 22 respectively. 
With yet another year of play anticipated, 
Coleman has already achieved a career-high 
score of 27 points and six blocked shots. He 
led Carnegie Mellon in scoring eight times 
this season.
The Tartans finished in third place in die 
PAC this season, after an up-and-down year 
of wins and losses.
with the Pirates, after coming from the 
Yankees organization during the winter in 
the trade for Rick Rhoden. A six-year veteran 
of the minor leagues, Easley's mastery of the 
split-fingered fastball last season propelled 
him to Yankees Minor League Pitcher of the 
Year status. Despite the honor, the trade to 
Pittsburgh removed a roadblock in Easley's 
journey to the major leagues.
"The Yankees were starting to make a 
move of getting some young people up 
there, but then all of a sudden they would go 
out and buy somebody and blow everything 
they had worked on." Easley remembers. "It 
just wasnt the environment where you were 
going to get promoted as you deserved to 
be."
But Easley is a righthanded short reliever, 
the only pitching department where the 
Pirates have depth. With Don Robinson and 
Brian Fisher ahead of him, Easley might 
have to adapt to a different role. "Ill take the 
set up man, If that's available to me."
In any case, he is still fighting against the 
odds in his first major-league training camp.
"The way I see it we are going to take ten 
pitchers north, and hopefully that's the ten 
best pitchers lefthanded, righthanded, either 
way...If they go with the ten best, I think I 
have a shot I feel comfortable and confident 
and ready," Easley said.*****
Although the Pirates seem to have more 
talent in spring training, some players feel 
there is something missing. The team still 
seems to be searching for an identity, and 
someone to bring out that identity. Sid 
Bream voiced his idea of what could fill the 
void.
"I definitely think we're going to need 
someone to come out in the limelight and be 
a leader. We just need somebody, whoever 
its going to be. They dont need to be vocal, 
they don't have to put on a lot of actions, 
they just need to be there. We definitely need 
a strong leader. Like Willie Stargell."

At the other end, McFarland missed the free

Thirty seconds later, Smith hit a jumper at

McFarland.

A 3 game losing streak heading into the 
playoffs usually spells disaster for a team. 
But for the Carnegie Mellon Ice Tartans it 
was a blessing in disguise.
The Tartans, led by 2 goals apiece from 
juniors Greg Timmons and Bryan Nogrady, 
crushed Slippery Rock Sunday, 10-3, 
snapping a 4 game winless streak. Carnegie 
Mellon hadn't won a hockey game since 
defeating the Rock, 7-2, on February 10.
The first round playoff victory propels 
Carnegie Mellon into a second round clash 
Thursday with Gannon. The Golden 
Knights started the Tartans' recent slide, 
tying them in Erie February 16, 6-6, and 
beating the Tartans on their home ice, 5-4, 
two days later. Gannon wound up finishing 
2nd in the West Penn Collegiate Hockey 
Association (WPCHA) with 18 points (8-2- 
2), a single point better than the 3rd place 
Tartans. Carnegie Mellon finished the 
season with a 7-4-3 conference record, 7-7-3 
overall. Slippery Rock was 4-9-1 in 
WPCHA play.
The 1st place Duquesne Dukes caused the 
other half of the Tartans winless streak. The 
Dukes beat Carnegie Mellon last Wednesday 
at the 1, Lebanon Rec. Center, 4-1, and 
edged the Tartans Saturday, 5-4, with an 
empty-net goal in the closing minute. 
Duquesne finished the year at 11-1-1 (23 
points).
But the Tartans were able to put the losing 
streak behind them. "With all the cancelled 
games in the last several weeks, we lost 
momentum," said junior tri-captain Sean 
EiGappI "Despite losing, weve been 
PbapapP Blu momentum kbin each game. 
GeuP [Timmons, also b tri-captain] and I 
lbAu kuup telling Blu team to just have fun, 
bpy to play hockey the way we know we 
ibpI\ Spy the Tartans certainly did on 
Sunday. Carnegie Mellon spotted the Rock 
an early goal before scoring 6 unanswered 
tallies to put the contest away. Slippery 
Rock defenseman (D) Darren Hickey caught 
Tartan goaltender John Kerber napping to the 
stick side at 5:43, but center (C) Timmons 
returned the favor just 2 minutes later with 
his 24th goal of the season, assisted by 
freshman right wing Chris Galvin and 
defenseman Jim Larson, a MEMS grad 
studenL Timmons, a tri-captain, garnered 
his 5th hat trick of the season in Saturday's 
Duquesne game.
Freshman Todd Henderson, a left fapP 
(LW) from Liverpool, N.Y., put the ,beBbph 
ahead for good at 5:55. Timmons and eaPlB 
wing (RW) Mike McGuire left a free -tin ap 
the slot, and Henderson blasted it kg 
Slippery Rock netminder Jeff Kutch Nwe lah 
4th goal of the year.
"I was out of position," recalled Henderson. 
"I had just won the faceoff and wound tap 
the high slot on the wrong side. I Ptuhh 
Ijust happened to be in the right place bB Blu 
right time."
Just 47 seconds later, the freshman LW 
returned the favor for Timmons. The junior 
C hit Henderson in the left faceoff circle; 
Kutch stopped Henderson, but Timmons was 
there to clean up with his 2nd goal of the 
game. The Tartans led 3-1 after one period.
The second period was quiet except for b 15 
second stretch which saw the Tartans Bbccg 
twice. Slippery Rock LW Curt oauPuc 
pulled down tri-captain RW Pat Eueilbn? 
and C Dave Basile, a grad hBtyupB 
fromGreensburg, knocked in a loose -tin 
during the delayed penalty at 2:48. ShhahBuy 
by Merchak and LW Kenon Smith, Bfw wN 
three Tartans from the School of Urban bpy 
Public Affairs (SUPA), it was Basile's NaehB 
red-lighter of the season.
After the ensuing faceoff, McGuire, Blu 
third of the SUPA Ice Tartans, broke ap 
offsides. He then redeemed himself ' 
seconds later, backhanding the puck wAue 
Kutch's stick during a "mini" 2-on-l faBl 
Timmons.
The goal, McGuire's 12th of the year, 
broke a 5 game, 35 day drought The former 
Hamilton College star was excited. "I've 
been playing well lately, and it's been 
frustrating. My shots have been there, but 
so have the opposing goaltenders."
Trailing 5-1 after two periods, Slippery 
Rock pulled Kutch, who had saved 25 of O 
Tartan shots in favor of Clarence Hawk. 0B 
didn't matter. 'Defenseman Rich Nave, a 
junior from Huntington Woods, Mich., 
garnered his first tally of the year at O:V/? 
with assists from Timmons and McGuire. 0B 
was the first of 5 third period goals by 
Carnegie Mellon.
At 8:39, Slippery Rock C Jeff Woodward 
disrupted the barrage during a Marie Robson 
penalty with theRocks second goal, assisted 
by RW Tom Cole and C Sean Burke. The 
goal, which came after two exceptional saves 
by netminder Kerber, cut the Tartans lead to
