Pittsburgh's Beautiful March; 
Just "Give Peace a Chance
by Janice Richman
I think the march started for 
me on Tuesday. As part of a small 
hardcore who fasted, I spent a 
dizzy day starting with the pre
moratorium rally. Glenn Grannemann and Tom Burgess quietly 
explained the courage of their 
commitment (Resistance is a way 
of life); Mike Spring sang Busi
ness as Usual, which ironically 
was not prophetic for Wednes
day, and I sang the only song that 
Ill ever write, inspired by Joan 
Baez. Then we all sang Down 
by the Riverside for the first 
time and everybody shook hands 
around the world.
After crowding into the Tartan 
Grill for the Guerrilla Theatre, 
we made a hasty exit from the un
usually tempting brownies and 
formed a circle in Skibo Lounge. 
When we sang Down by the Riv
erside for the fourth time to a 
group of very young people who 
loved shaking hands around the 
world and promised theyd all 
come back (they were being shep
herded around by a nun), I thought 
the music had said all it could. 
But we went on forever, singing 
in a circle where you could look 
straight into anyones eyes.
Then I helped put up an exhibit 
on the Vietnam Moratorium that
Moratorium Impact 
On Entire Country
While an estimated 12,000 demonstrators turned out against the 
war in Pittsburgh on the 15th, millions of others across the nation ob
served the Moritorium in their own ways, with rallies, marches, and 
silent vigils in honor of the war dead.
One focal point for the Moratoriums participation was in the na
tions capital, where on the floors of the House and the Senate, in the 
streets, on the steps of the capital, and on college campuses, speeches 
were made imploring the adminisb
had been destroyed Monday night. 
Posters, articles, schedules  
nothing was left but some UPI 
photographs of Vietnam. By Wed
nesday morning, even those were 
gone. Instead of our second ex
hibit  admittedly less artistical
ly arranged than the first  a few 
mimeographed leaflets Victory 
in Vietnam gave a clue to the 
identity of the vandals. We did not 
put up a third exhibit.
All this was a strange prologue 
to a beautiful march. As a mar
shal, I got to run up and down 
most of the C-MU line700 strong 
encouraging people to run and 
close the gaps caused by the end
less sequence of traffic lights. 
The dramats had everyone sing
ing All That Were Saying Is 
Give Peace a Chance to the beat 
of their drum all the way through 
the Hill and beyond. I heard other 
groups singing Down by the Riv
erside for the nth time.

MMCC To Die? 
Proposals Offered
A proposal to drop the entire degree-granting program of Mar
garet Morrison Carnegie College was proposed on Oct. 14 to the Uni
versitys Faculty Senate. The Faculty Senates educational policy coun
cil made the proposal. This council is made up of faculty members, 
administrators, and students.
The council proposed that the University accept no more students 
for admission to either undergraduate work or graduate work in 
MMCC, but there was considerable opposition to the plan by students 
who asked for a one-year delay in putting the plan into effect.
Since such departments as Eng"
lish and History, once offered by 
MMCC, are now included in the 
new College of Humanities and So
cial Sciences, the MMCC only of
fers such studies as foods and nu
trition, clothing and textiles, and 
business studies.
According to Dr. Erwin R. 
Steinberg, We have a commit
ment to womens education, but 
we have been seeking a meaning
ful function for the college to 
serve.
The educational policy council 
also made three proposals for the 
University to consider in its aim 
to educate women: 1) That a mas
ters degree program be offered in 
early childhood education, 2) 
That MMCC continue to research 
the role of the educated woman in 
American society, and 3) That 
there be a continuation of the ed
ucational center for mature wom
en to prepare them in specific 
fields.
The declining enrollment in the 
college was the primary reason 
for the policy decision. According 
to the council the enrollment now 
stands at less than 135 students, 
and there were merely 41 fresh
men entered this fall. The fact 
also remains that the present fac
ulty, now near retirement age, 
will have to be replaced by topnotch new members, and there is 
great difficulty in finding these 
proposed new faculty members. 
By the time the present freshmen 
students graduate, in 1973, all but 
one of the present home econom
ics faculty members will have 
reached retirement age.
tration to disengage itself from 
the war. Government employees 
observed a silent vigil on the steps 
of the capital building. Participa
tion involved about 1,000.
In New York City, Mayor John 
Lindsay ordered flags to be low
ered in sympathy with the cause. 
Wall Street magnates set up Mor
atorium booths. The mass of peo
ple assembled there represented 
a united wall of humanity against 
the war. A few of the opposition 
were also evident, holding signs 
proclaiming Bomb Hanoi.
In San Francisco, marchers set 
out early in the morning to troop 
into the city across the Golden 
Gate bridge.
Many congressmen and sena
tors got into the act individually. 
Senator Edward Kennedy called
fof unilateral withdrawl from 
Vietnam within the year. Demo
cratic leader Mike Mansfield call
ed the Moratorium a dramatic 
demonstration of public impati
ence with a war that drags on with 
no end in sight. Fifteen Republi
can congressmen, however, chose 
the day to sign a letter to the Pres
ident urging sudden and major 
escalation of the war. And in At
lanta, Lester Maddox stated that 
the Moratorium will strengthen 
the cause of the communists. 
Meanwhile, however, Senator Mc
Govern praised the demonstra
tions as the highest patriotism. 
Sympathy, while not unanimous 
among the nations political lead
ers, seemed to be running high.
The Moratorium was observed 
to some extent outside the U.S. In
(Continued on Page 3)
According to Steinberg, the 
Faculty Senate has the final say 
on the matter at hand before the 
proposal goes to the President 
and the Board of Trustees. If the 
proposal goes through, incoming 
freshmen women will have to en
ter either the College of Human
ities and Social Sciences, the Col
lege of Fine Arts, or Carnegie 
Institute of Technology.
The council noted that govern
ment support of such courses of
fered by MMCC has been made 
more available for state colleges 
than it has for such private insti
tutions as C-MU. Steinberg also 
urged an early decision on the mat
ter, since the Admission Office of 
the University already is receiv
ing inquiries and applications for 
the upcoming fall term.
At a meeting of the Faculty Sen
ate Tuesday the faculty put off un
til next month a decision on 
whether to phase out the home 
economics courses.
The Senate considered a recom
mendation by the educational po
licy council which said that all 
four courses in the college would 
be phased out because of dwind
ling enrollments.
The Faculty Senate tabled the 
decision until next months meet
ing or until a special meeting is 
called.

Wolfenstein Views Stever Manifesto
Editor, qla qiARis1
In his talk on Sept. 22, President 
Stever emphasized as a basic 
principle that the University must 
not engage in political action. A 
similar statement has been made 
by my collegue. Professor Grif
fiths, in a letter to the qiARis of 
Oct. 3. The trouble with these pos
itions lies in their failure to rec
ognize that the University has in 
the past and continues to take po
litical action. The real issue is 
where the University stands when 
it is forced to take political ac
tion.
On that same Sept. 22, I receiv
ed in the mail a copy of the Stever 
manifesto on disruptive dem
onstrations, one of the hottest 
political subjects in the country 
today. Here I find outlined possi
ble actions the University might 
take, including injunctive pro
cesses and assistance from 
law enforcement officials, which 
are highly political in character.
Indeed, who are the law en
forcement officials referred to 
by President Stever? Are these 
the Pittsburgh police who brutal
ly assaulted the Black Construc
tion Committee march on Bloody 
Tuesday? Are these the Pittsburgh 
police noted for their unjustified 
harassment and arrests of inno
cent people in Shadyside? Or per
haps such defenders of the consti
tution as Mr. Duggan? Just to re
fer to such people as law enforce
ment officials is a political act.
The decision of the University 
on Sept. 23 to ask for an injunc
tion and, in particular, the word
ing of the injunction were again 
political actions. The injunction 
was obviously worded by lawyers 
whose whole orientation was to
wards the business world and who 
did not care about civil liberties. 
When Vice-president Kibbee was 
asked, during the Senate debate 
on Sept. 30, as to the constitution
ality of the limit on picketing, he 
said in effect that the University 
has no interest in the constitu
tional rights of its students and 
faculty. That too is a political 
position.
There are many other political 
positions taken by the University 
in its relation to the community 
and its choice of research.
What does President Stever 
mean by being non-political? Bas
ed on observations I will hazard a 
guess. When President Stevers 
political actions are directed by 
his right-wing friends or his es
tablishment lawyers, then they 
are non-political. But when fac
ulty and students urge President 
Stever to act in a liberal and hu
mane fashion, that is impossible, 
because that is political.
Lincoln Wolfenstein 
Professor of Physics
Turn Out Lites
Editor, qla qiARis1
I would like to suggest that all 
the indoor lighting of Warner Hall 
be turned off at night when the 
building is not in use, and that a 
check be sent each month for the 
money saved by this action to aid 
VISTA or some other organiza
tion in service to Americas poor.

Anti-war Rally on Tuesday 
Mocks Vietnam Involvement
mr bresar oacsmaAp
Tech began its Moritorium on Tuesday with an 
anti-war rally on the cut. The cold discouraged a 
large attendance; there were only about 35 people 
to listen to the first speaker, who, unfortunately, 
could not be understood.
The rally was transferred to the ballroom and 
the number of spectators increased. The next 
speaker was Glenn Grannaman. A former member 
of the Reserves, he felt a moral obligation to turn 
in his draft card. He explained his reasons to the 
crowd which now stood and sat on the ballroom 
floor.
Tom Burgess spoke next. He refused induction 
19 hours after graduation. It is his belief that you
cant just Rik; about making things better, you must 
JyA; to make them better. Revolution is not enough; 
it only changes the roles of oppressor and oppressed.
While waiting for the Guerilla Theater to make 
its appearance, guitars were produced and an im
promptu singing session started. A sudden an
nouncement that the theater had started in the Tar
tan Grill sent everyone rushing out of the ballroom. 
The players sang America the Beautiful while 
chanting such classic slogans as Better Dead Than 
Red and Support Our Boys. The performance 
culminated in the mock execution of a Viet Cong 
soldier and the dispersal of the players and every
one else.
Thieu Invites Students
College students, especially 
those who are anti-war, have been 
invited by South Vietnames Pres
ident Nguyen Van Thieu to visit 
South Vietnam for an inspection 
of the war zone.
I think they will change their 
minds, the President said during 
a tour of the northern province of 
Thau Thien.
I will welcome them in the In
dependence Palace. I will lead 
them on a visit and show them 
how the Vietnamese troops are 
fighting on the ground ...
Thieu attended a funeral cere
mony at Hue, the former imperial 
capital 390 miles north-northeast 
of Saigon, for hundreds of civili
ans killed by the Communists dur
ing the 1968 Tet offensive.
The bodies were discovered in 
recent months in mass graves.
Speaking in Vietnames, the 
President said that the war dem
onstrations Wednesday were a 
very normal thing in America 
but that the dissenters did not 
represent the opinion of the ma
jority.
First, this is a very normal 
thing in America, in a free and 
democratic country where the cit
izen has the right tmsay every
thing he wants to say, he said.
Secondly, the anti-war senti
ment reflects a minority of the 
opinion of the American people, 
not the large majority of the 
American people.
Thieu was later asked whether 
he had anything specific to say 
to American college students who 
organized and participated in the 
Moratorium.
I think that I will welcome any 
delegation of the college students 
who would like to come here and 
who represent all of the anti-war 
factions, he said.
He also said he expected per
haps 200 American protest lead
ers might take up his offer ii 
they would like to see the truth in 
Vietnam.

Students Make Statements on Dissolving MMCC
The people who are a part of 
C-MU are well aware of Dean 
Steinbergs recommendation, 
which was approved by the Edu
cational Policy Council, to phase 
out the business and human re
source studies provided by MM 
CC. No until September of this 
year were the students permit
ted to know of Dean Steinbergs 
actions. A visiting committee 
composed partly of alumnae of 
C-MU recommended that, situ
ations being what they were, 
MMCC not admit freshman in 
September, 1970.
We as students want a re
vision of the existing programs 
offered in business and human re
source studies to the extent that 
they will offer subjects more per
tinent to the professions involved, 
research options designed toward 
graduate school, and an updating 
of existing programs where the 
students feel it is necessary.
It is to the credit of MMCC 
that it has been able to attract 
a rather steady number of stu
dents each year considering:
1. The lack of cooperation 
from the Admissions Office,
2. the propagation of the old 
CIT image of a school for en
gineers and artists,
3. the fact that we do not have 
a dean who is involved in bus
iness and human resource stu
dies,
4. the attitude of students in 
Fine Arts and CIT that business 
and human resource studies are 
for Do-dos and are not as wor
thy of studying as the profes
sions in the other colleges,
5. watered down courses have 
shoved under the the name of 
MMCC instead of remaining 
in their related departments.
Moratorium
(Continued from Page 1)
Parris, about 70 American stu
dents demonstrated in the court
yard of the American Embassy. 
About 200 marched before the 
Embassy in London. Even in Sai
gon, a group of civilian workers 
held a moment of silent prayer for 
the end of the war with the U.S. 
ambassador, Ellsworth Bunker. 
Up near the DMZ a few soldiers 
donned black arm bands in sym
pathy with the Moratorium back 
home.
Where we go from here will not 
be readily apparent in the face of 
the immediate and profuse enthu
siasm of the demonstrators and 
the reactions of pro-war factions. 
The trees are a little too thick 
right now for those in the forest. 
But plans are already under way 
for Novembers March on Wash
ington. Perhaps in the month that 
follows, definite direction will 
evolve of itself. Or perhaps even 
the long-hoped for response will 
come from the White House in the 
form of definitive action on the 
part of the U.S. toward withdraw
ing from the war.
The visiting committee found 
a struggling college that, consi
dering these odds that were 
against it, was able to provide a 
first-rate education with lit
tle support from any other part 
of the university. We now present 
reasons for the continuation of 
business and resource studies at 
C-MU.
The professions offered in bus
iness and human resource stu
dies are expanding and be
coming more important every 
year. It is hard for engineers to 
understand that fashion is im
portant to our standard of living 
just as it is hard for a person de
dicated to the fine arts to under
stand that people are needed to 
fill occupations as common as 
executive secretaries. What is 
surprising is the fact that peo
ple involved in urban affairs do 
not recognize the affect of nu
trition on a childs intelligence 
or the affect of a good home en
vironment on the healthy develop
ment of a neighborhood. Man 
cannot live only on pure tech
nology and the arts.
Unfortunately the connota
tion of home in the term home 
economics has led people to be
lieve that the related professions 
deal with house-keeping. The 
comforts of living as we realize 
them in our lives are not avail
able to those who lack the fun
damental knowledge of economy 
in the home.
The clothing we wear did 
jiot get from the fiber produc
ers to the stores by osmosis. It 
needed researchers, designers, 
buyers, and merchandisers.
The idea of a balanced diet 
did not come out of an organic 
chemists test tube. It needed 
researchers, nutritionists, and 
people able to communicate these 
findings to the public. Hospi
tals are without trained diet
icians because they are not en
ough dieticians to fill the va
cancies.
A person gaining admissions 
into the AMS curriculum is told 
that a bachelors degree needs 
a masters degree to be worth
while. The business studies un
der question provides a skill 
plus a well rounded education 
and a college atmosphere not 
available in a two year program.
March
(Continued from Page 1)
I laughed at the hoarse rasps 
of the people who had led the 
Peace Now chants with what 
was left of my voice. I flashed the 
peace sign at high school kids, a 
hell of a lot of my classmates, all 
my friends at Pitt and Teach, and 
half the faculty in my department. 
I have to believe the person who 
told me 20,000 people had been 
counted in Point State Park. Its 
got to be the most incredible 
march Pittsburgh has ever creat
ed, whether Nixon likes it or not.
Maternity, as well as military, 
leaves are not plentiful in the 
business world. The training 
provided in this type of a pro
gram allows a person to return to 
work after a leave of absence 
and earn a living.
We feel that the problems of 
decreasing enrollment in the 
business and human resource stu
dies is due to the lack of infor
mation available to persons de
siring these studies in a private 
school. Girls private high schools 
are not visited by C-MU recrui
ters. The question of tuition de
ferring future students can be 
answered by the aid available to 
students in need ol help. We feel 
that from these two sources there 
are enough students qualifying 
for admissions who would ap
ply if they knew of the programs 
offered at C-MU. We therefore 
are willing to cooperate with the 
Admissions Office in the recruit
ing of these students, but we 
need the support of the univer
sity.
Up to this time, the faculty 
and students of MMCC have 
askes questions and received no 
answers. We have dealth poli
tely with the situation and have 
tried not to step on the fing
ers of those who were pulling 
the rug from under our feet. We 
now publicly address our ques
tions to every one concerned with 
the anhilation of the programs in 
business and human resource stu
dies, and particularly to the 
following persons:
Dean Steinberg,
1. Why werent the students of 
business and human resource stu
dies informed sooner of the recomendation you presented to the 
Educational Policy Council?
2. Why did the visiting com
mittee not confer with the stu
dents before their decision was 
reached?
3. Why were not the alumnae 
informed of the course of ac
tion?
4. Why have you not present
ed declining figures for ad
mission to business and human 
resource management with the 
number of transfer students from 
other departments as well as from 
other schools each year and why 
have you not compared them to 
the same type of information for 
other colleges on this campus?
I would like to thank all 
those who made the Morator
ium at CMU the success it 
was. It should be noted that 
the leaders of the various ac
tivities here represented a 
cross-section of the campus, 
the Moratorium at CMU shows 
what potential we have, we 
should remember that todays 
Moratirum is only a begin
ning. There will be a meeting 
7:30 p.m. Monday, Oct. 20th 
room 45 Skibo.
John Agatston
Lighter Penalties for Grass?
A top Nixon aide indicated 
this week that the Administra
tion is expected to urge the el
imination of prescribed jail sen
tences for possession of mari
juana, leaving the actual sen
tence up to the discretion of the 
judge.
Dr. Roger O. Egeberg, assis
tant secretary of Health, Edu
cation and Welfare, said that 
HEW, the House Crime Com
mittee and the Justice Depart
ment have developed several 
laternative penalty structures
in addition to the less severe 
ones already proposed to Congress 
by the Nixon administration.
The law presently calls for 
jail terms of two to five years on 
the first offense of possession of 
marijuana and up to 20 years 
for the third offense.
The Administration bill al
ready sent to Congress proposed 
probation for the first offense, 
two to ten years for the second, 
and 10 to 20 for the third offense.
Mr. Egeberg indicated that 
these proposals would be liberal
ized further. But committee staff 
members failed to get a conces
sion from Theodore Ellenbogen, 
an HEW attorney, that more lib
eral proposals, including the el
imination of prescribed sentences, 
would be sent to Congress soon.
However, staff members said 
that they understood the Ad
ministration would propose that 
all arrests for the possession of 
marijuana would be classified 
as misdemeanors and that there 
be mandatory jail sentences.
5. This question is directed to 
you as an English professor who 
has nursed the H?SS college from 
its conceptions. Would the dis
missal of business and human re
source studies permit the admis
sion of more students into the 
H&SS programs?
6. Why does the college con
taining business and human re
source studies not have a dean 
who knows what is going on in 
the professions involved?
7. It has been stated that a 
major reason for the phasing out 
of these programs is the decrease 
in enrollment for the past twenty 
years. You cannot provide reasons 
for this trend. Why have you not 
investigated the causes?
Admissions Office:
1. Why do C-MU recruiters 
not have sufficient information 
to give to prospective students 
who wish to enter business and 
human resource studies? Why 
are these studies usually ignor
ed?
2. Why was there not a better 
attempt to inform prospective 
students about the business and 
human resource programs offer
ed when the admission started to 
decline?
3. Were there not members on 
Mortar Board who were in FA 
and CIT when Mortar Board re
cruited students? Were they as
sisted by the Admissions Of
fice?
4. Is it true that standards for 
admissions are sometimes low
ered for MMCC students? If 
so, why is this polity practiced?
Student Representatives
1. How much of an attempt 
did you make to understand the 
feelings of business and hu
man resource students before you 
voted at the Educational Policy 
Council meeting?
2. Why did you not meet with 
business and human resource stu
dents?
3. How could you intelligent
ly vote as representatives of the 
students when you did not under
stand the situation?
These questions have been 
tossed around since students 
were permitted to know about 
the fate of their professions 
at C-MU. We want the answers in 
writing. In addition to these 
questions we also ask if the MMCC 
removal sets the precedent for 
other professions at C-MU, 
namely the metallurgy, chem
ical engineering, and civil en
gineering departments?

War To End 
Anytime Now
According to some stastical 
formulas of a former Stanford 
university researcher, the fight
ing in Vietnam probably will 
end almost any month now.
Dr. John Voevodsky, now a 
private consultant, reached his 
conclusion from equations in
volving battle statistics from four 
equations involving battle sta
tistics from four major United 
States conflicts, the Civil War, 
the two world wars, and the Kor
ean war.
A study submitted to the Navy 
in May, 1868 by Dr. Voevodsky 
predicting casuality rates and 
other figures on the basis of 
mathematical equations have pro
ven accurate within one or two 
percent, the Doctor stated.
Im not a soothsayer, he 
said. Im just saying what the 
statistical trends indicate.
His charts suggest both sides 
in the Vietnam war are now at 
a point where they will either 
cease hostilities or commence 
a major escalation.
For the United States, this 
could mean doubling its mili
tary forces in Vietnam to more 
than one million men.
This decision, Dr. Voevodsky 
said, already should have been 
made, according to the charts, 
will become known before the 
end of the Vietnam rainy sea
son.
He plots the relationships be
tween battle casualties and 
deaths, troop strength and cas
ualties, and troop strength and the 
time it takes for the war to end.

The Tragedies of War 
Protest Films Illuminate
by Sara Cooper
In protest of the war and in conjunction with the Vietnam Mora
torium events, four films were presented on Wednesday morning, Oct. 
15, in Skibo.
Over 500 persons, most of them wearing arm bands in sympathy, 
viewed these films in an aura of concern which reinforced an attitude 
of complete disillusionment and anger at the senselessness and futility 
that has been precipitated by the continuation of the war effort in Viet
nam. ....... .....................
Culloden by the BBC was a 
remake of the 18th Century Bat
tle at Culloden in Great Britain. 
Nine thousand British and Scot
tish clansmen fought in vain  
killing a race of people. The 
Scots were pathetically slaughter
ed at the hands of the ruthless 
British and through all their ef
forts created a desert and call
ed it peace. The simple analogy 
to Vietnam can be made in pure 
statistics  40.000 men have been 
pathetically slaughtered, and in
Pag 4THE TARTANFriday, October 17, 1969
Focusing on the frightened and 
bewildered families of Vietnam, 
The Time of the Locust illus
trated in harsh and unfeeling 
terms the atrocities, torture and 
mass plunder of the Vietnames 
people. The contrast of Saigon 
nightlife with the marshes and 
swamps clearly showed the total 
duality by which the Asian coun
try exists from day to day.
Superimposed over this film 
was the voice of Lyndon Johnson 
in excerpts from speeches on his 
war policy. This commentary and 
its supposed overtones of peace 
by Johnson were in essence 
merely humorous retorts to the 
grave situation.
An experimental Polish film, 
The Magicial, capitalized on 
the innocence of youth, deviously 
enticed into the bizarre and cruel 
world of war games. Devoid of 
any speaking, the film employed 
the music of the calliope to follow 
the unknowing boys through in
doctrination to their develop
ment of the sinister war intellect. 
Accomplished through the guise 
of fun and games, the innocents 
lost their sense of reality and 
and gave way to the stark naked
ness of war.

The final movie, Vietnam  
How Did We Get inHow Do We 
Get Out? was a documentary 
speech by David Schoenxaum. He 
stated that it is not the Vietna
mese people or their communist 
doctrine that has changed since 
Ho Chi Mihn but that it is the Unit
ed States which has changed.
At the conclusion of the movie, 
Schoenbaum offered a rationale 
for the ending of the Vietnam War 
and perhaps hope for America to
day: Our country right or
wrong? If it is right, let us pre
serve that right, but if it is wrong, 
let us work to right that wrong.

Agnew Takes A Stand 
On Letter From Hanoi
Massive demonstrations, including the lowering of flags to halfstaff, rallies, discussions, marches, teach-ins, and prayers, took place 
across the country Wednesday, Oct. 15.
Amidst the demonstrations, other developments took place. In 
Washington Tuesday,20 congressmen who have been most vocal 
about the war planned an all-night session of Congress.

In Paris, the Hanoi Govern
ment, in a public statement, hail
ed the demonstrations as a time
ly rebuff to the Nixon adminis
tration and also as an expression 
of the American peoples will to 
save their children and brothers 
from a useless death in Vietnam.
Vice-President Agnew, urged 
on by President Nixon, called Ha
nois statement a shocking in
trusion into the affairs of the 
American people.
Appearing at a White House 
press conference, he challenged 
the leaders of the Moratorium to 
repudiate the expression of sup
port from the Premier of North 
Vietnam.
Agnew denied that he was lead
ing a last-minute campaign to un
dermine the Moratorium and dis
credit the protest.
Mr. Agnew said that the lead
ers of the Moratorium should 
repudiate the support of a totali
tarian government which has on its 
hands the blood of 40,000 Amercans.
He said further that the Mora
torium leaders were now 
chargeable with the knowledge 
of this letter and must clearly 
enunciate the purpose of the dem
onstrations.
When a reporter asked Agnew 
how the demonstrators could dis
associate themselves with the let
ter from Hanoi, the Vice-Presi
dent said :
Thats up to them. They or
ganized the demonstration. Let 
them ficure out how to exDlain it.
In response to the letter and 
Mr. Agnews statement, the Mor
atorium leaders issued a state
ment which said:
Oct. 15 is an appeal to the con
science of the American people. 
It is regrettable the Administra
tion would seize this straw in an 
attempt to discredit the patriot
ism of the millions of Americans 
who sincerely desire peace.
In the meantime, President 
Nixon was continuing his low-key 
effort of recent weeks to empha
size his desire for peace on terms 
that would protect the self-inter
est of South Vietnam and the 
credibility of United States for
eign policy in Southeast Asia.
Elsewhere in the world, Presi
dent Nguyen Van Thieu said he 
was confident that the majority 
of Americans backed the allied 
war effort.
In New York City, Mayor Lndsay, despite growing opposition 
especially from veteran organiza
tions, the police and firemen, re
mained firm in his decision to 
participate in the Moratorium. He 
proclaimed a day of observance to 
mourn the Vietnam war dead. He 
also planned to deck City Hall in 
mourning and lower th^ flag 
there.

Nixon Optimistic
At a recent dinner for the Assoc
iated Press at the White House, 
President Nixon expressed opti
mistic hopes for the easing of sev
eral major problems now facing 
the U.S. Nixon believes that be
fore his present term ends in 1972-- 
Vietnam. inflation and crime will 
not be the pressing issues now con
fronting the nation.
Inflation, he said, will have been 
checked because we went in at 
the heart of the problem and took 
our hard knocks now and later this 
winter in order that we could have 
smoother sailing later.
Congress, Nixon feels, will have
to pass the crime bills. Cong
ress simply cannot be political in 
this one area. Nixon foresees a 
new approach to the disastrous 
situation of welfare, as well.
Vietnam, the President said, 
will be a thing of the past in three 
years. By then the war will be ov1 
er, ended on a basis that will 
promote lasting peace in the Pac
ific.
In a sweeping declaration en
compassing Federal Programs 
ranging from peace to new housing 
and transportation the President 
stated that all these can happen 
in three years.

Its only one of the imaginative ways 
you can use your talent at Norden. 
Because here, we see things a bit 
differently. Technologically. Crea
tively. And in business.
One example is the Contact Analog 
system you see above. Displaying al
titude, air speed, attitude, velocity 
vector, and other flight information 
into easily-assimilated pictorial form. 
With virtually limitless applications 
for air/spacecraft, on land, or under 
sea.
Interesting? We think so. But what it 
says about Norden may interest you
more.
Technologically, Contact Analog rep
resents a sophisticated utilization of 
analog and digital techniques, illus
trating the kind of interdisciplinary 
activity thats made our team prob
lem-solving approach so successful. 
Creatively, it demonstrates the fact 
that new ideaseven radical ones 
get past the idea stage at Norden. 
And from a business standpoint, in
dicates the fact that Nordens suc
cess is based upon innovation. 
Innovation in areas like pilot dis
plays, airborne radar systems, 
ground support equipment, optical 
devices and computer technology.

Resnick, Rapping Talks 
Favor Troop Withdrawl
by Jeff Ruben
The American people are being deceived by the Nixon Administra
tion. Partial withdrawls and seemingly lower draft calls do not accom
plish anything toward ending the war in Vietnam, and therefore our 
only alternative is the immediate and complete withdrawl of all Amer
ican forces from Vietnam. These were the basic conclusions reached 
by Dr. Daniel Resnick of the History Department and Dr. Leonard Rap
ping of GSIA in a panel discussion held in Skibo ballroom during the 
Moratorium. An enthusiastic audience seemed to concur.
March for Peace
Grannemann Returns 
Draft Cards to Board
Dr. Resnick began by discuss
ing what he feels to be the main 
obstacles in the way of the extri
cation of our troops from Viet
nam. He cited:
1. The support of our govern
ment for the Thieu-Ky regime, 
even though it is not representa
tive of the South Vietnamese peo
ple.
2. The intention of the U.S. to be 
bastion in Southeast Asia against 
Communist China. The knowledge 
of this intent, Dr. Resnick feels, 
will keep the war going for an in
definite period of time.
3. Our governments refusal to 
accept the reality that the Viet 
Cong control at least half the ter
ritory of South Vietnam.
4. A weakness in Americas 
peace movement stemming from 
the fact that few Americans ac
tually know any Vietnames peo
ple. The peace movement in this 
country has been basically nega
tive against our own government 
rather than positively for the Vi
etnames people.
5. The stealing of American 
symbols, such as the flag, by pro
war factions. This has created the 
confusion among non-politicized 
Americans as to whether the 
American flag symbolizes peace 
or right-wing reactionism. Dr. 
Resnick feels this is changing,
The Vietnam Moratorim has 
evoked a fantastic volume of 
rhetoric from supporters and op
position alike. Amidst the tide of 
words, however, what the Mora
torium is about has got lost. Let 
us sum up, then, what argu
ments, pro and con, are being of
fered by Moratorium organizers 
and by the Nixon Administration.
According to the organizers, 
Oct. 15 is a day for Americans to 
take time off from their usual pur
suits to demonstrate for an im
mediate and final end to Ameri
can involvement in the Vietnam 
War. The demonstration is need
ed, says the pro faction, because 
Americans and Vietnamese are 
dying needlessly . . . South Viet
nam is being destroyed . . . and 
Americas national priorities are 
distorted as the nation moves no 
closer to a resolution.
- The Administration agrees that 
there has been no progress at 
Paris, but sees some accom

however, and he expressed hope 
that the American flag would soon 
be a symbol of the peace move
ment.
Dr. Resnick proposed immedi
ate withdrawl as the only alterna
tive possible, but Dr. Rapping 
stated that there does exist an
other alternative: the complete 
annihilation of the Vietnames peo
ple and culture. His point was also 
clear; the troops must be with
drawn. Dr. Rapping then present
ed statistics and other informa
tion to support his contention.
Rapping described most pres
ent proposals for peace, such as 
the one made by college presi
dents, as vague, and he cited 
a Rand Corporation study which 
showed that the costs of U.S. in
volvement in Vietnam far out
weigh any benefits that might be 
derived from this involvement. 
He used quotes from LBJ and Nix
on to show the similarity in ob
jectives of the two administra
tions. The level of violence in Vi
etnam will remain high even with 
the small troop withdrawls Nix
on has proposed, asserted Dr. 
Rapping.
The discussion ended with a 
short question and answer period, 
followed by a round of applause 
which appeared to display support 
as well as thanks.
There is also feeling within the 
Administration that an American 
withdrawl would lower faith in 
U.S. commitments in Europe and 
Asia. The President feels that to 
change his position as a result of 
demonstrations would invite an
archy.

Unilateral Withdrawal
Urged by Six Scientists
Six Rand scientists who have 
done research on Vietnam for the 
Federal Government urged the 
United States to make a unilateral 
withdrawl of its troops from South 
Vietnam within a year, the New 
EyA; Times reported Oct. 8.
The six, acting specifically as 
individuals and not as represen
tatives of the Rand Corporation, 
said in a strong letter to the 
Times, Such disengagement 
should not be conditioned upon 
agreement or performance by Ha
noi or Saigoni.e., it should not 
be subject to veto by either side.
The six men, under contract to 
the Pentagon, have been engaged 
in the study of determining the ef
fectiveness of bombing North Vi
etnam and the interrogation of 
enemy prisoners.
The group includes experts on 
Russia, China and Japan. One of 
them, Daniel Ellsberg, sepnt two 
years working for the State De
partment in Saigon before joining 
Rand. Anothj signer, Melvin 
Gurtov, is the author of a forth
coming book on the future of 
American foreign policy in South
east Asia. The other signers are 
Oleg Hoeffding, Arnold L. Horelick, Konrad Kellen and Paul F. 
Langer.

The Nixon administration took 
a step toward easing the impact 
of the draft on graduate schools 
and their students.
President Nixon signed an or
der permitting graduate students 
called for induction into the armed 
services to complete the academ
ic year if they were successfully 
pursuing their course of stidy. 
Previously, graduate students 
were permitted to complete only 
the semester during which they 
were called for induction.
In themeantime, a cool Capitol 
Hill reception greeted an admin
istration request that Congress 
repeal legislation that prohibits 
using a lottery system to select 
men for induction.
Administration sources said 
that if the section were repealed 
they would substitute with a sys
tem that would operate as follows :

to Vietnam and that unconditional 
pullout was the only feasible al
ternative open to Washington.
One of the group commented 
that, Unilateral withdrawal is 
now respectable.
The letter listed four reasons, 
apart from persuasive moral ar
gument, for rapid withdrawal:
No. 1. Short of destroying 
the entire country and its people, 
we cannot eliminate the enemy 
forces in Vietnam by military 
means; in fact, military victory 
is no longer the U.S. bbjective. 
What should now also be recogniz
ed is that the opposing leadership 
cannot be coerced by the present 
or by any other available U. S. 
strategy into making the kinds of 
concessions currently demanded.
No. 2. Past U.S. promises to 
the Vietnames people are not 
served by prolonging our incon
clusive and highly destructive mil
itary activity in Vietnam. This 
activity must not be prolonged 
merely on demand of the Saigon 
government, whose capacity to 
survive on its own must finally be 
tested, regardless of outcome.
No. 3. The importance to the 
U.S. national interests of the fu
ture political complexion of South 
Vietnam has been greatly exag
erated, as has the negative interdar year or whose deferments ex
pire would be placed in a dfaft 
pool. Officials would assign by 
lot a number tmeach day of the 
year. Men born on the day desig
nated at number one would be 
called first. Then men born on 
date number two would be called, 
and so on until the draft quota was 
filled. Those not called would es
cape the draft entirely, barring 
the event of a national emergency.
Members of a special, five-man 
sub-committee of the Armed Serv
ices Committee of the House of Rep 
resentatives said they were unim
pressed by the plan.
If the Nixon plan is not approv
ed, the administration will try a 
modified random system, said 
Roger Kelley, Assistant Secretary 
of Defense for Manpwoer and Re
serve Affairs. This plan would in
volve shifting the group of eligible 
draftees from month to month to 
achieve a random effect.
Mr. Nixon has already said that 
if Congress does not approve his 
plan this, ^ear, he will make 
changes in the draft by Executive 
Order. These will include revers
ing the order of call to take 19- 
year-olds first and reducing the 
period of vulnerability from seven 
years to one year.
To many Congressional observ
ers it seems unlikely that Con
gress will take any action this 
year.
national impact of thsunilateral 
U.S. military withdrawal.
No. 4. Above all, the human, 
political, and material costs of 
continuing the war far outweight 
any prospective benefits, and are 
greater than the foreseeable costs 
and risks of disengagement.
The North Vietnamese, the let
ter stated, have shown amazing 
resiliency, determination, and 
effectiveness, even under ex
tremely adverse conditions. It 
continued that to assume that the 
enemy is weakening is a false as
sumption.
In addition, the North Vietna
mese would never accept a settle
ment that implied recognition of 
the authority of the Saigon govern
ment.
Thus to make the end of U.S. 
involvement contingent upon such 
concessions is to perpetuate our 
presence indefinately, it declar
ed.
The signers asserted that uni
lateral withdrawal would not ne
cessarily have disastrous conse
quences as many who are in favor 
of the war predict. Withdrawal, 
they said, could perhaps even pro
duce desirable political changes 
in Saigon by eliminating support 
for a regime which does not have 
the backing of the majority of 
South Vietnames, and by allowing 
a cohesive national consensus 
to emberge.
The letter added that the theory 
that a massive military effort in 
Vietnam would prevent proxy 
victories by the Soviet Union or 
Communist China has long since 
been discredited.
The signers indicated that they 
consider typical of or exerting de
cisive influence on other revolu
tionary movements in Asia or 
elsewhere.
We do not predict that only 
good consequences will follow for 
Southeast Asia or South Vietnam 
(or even the United States) from 
our withdrawal. the letter con
cluded. What we do say is that 
the risks will not be less after an
other year or more of American 
involvement, and the human costs 
will surely be greater.

Tuesday, October 14, 1969THE TARTANPage 9
Faculty at Harvard spposes War
The 150 abstentions were con
sidered mostly votes of protest 
against taking a political stand.
The resolution stated that, 
With full recognition that this 
action is not a precedent-setting 
action but one occasioned by the 
unique importance of the Viet
nam conflict, be it resolved 
that it is the sense of this faculty 
that the war in Vietnam must not 
continue. While our opinions dif
fer in detail, we agree in urging 
the prompt, rapid and complete 
withdrawal of United States 
forces. We support a united 
and sustained national effort to 
bring our troops home.
The vote came after a week of 
intense debate among the 
faculty. It seemed that the issue 
was not the war itself  per
haps there is ont one member of 
the faculty who supports the 
war  but whether or not the uni
versity should speak on matters of
ficially out of the universitys 
jurisdiction.
The liberal faction argued that 
the war, because of its impact on 
the campus, was a special case 
that the faculty had to deal 
with.
Members of the conservative 
faction feared that they would be 
setting a dangerous precedent if 
the colleges neutrality were 
compromised.

dent has announced that he is

At the same time, the state
ment condemned the Saigon 
leadership. Our goal is to secure 
a political free choice, they 
said. The goal of Thieu and Ky 
is in our opinion, to maintain 
themselves in power.
If Thieu and Ky do not acCongressmen To Stage

Professor John Edsall, prof. of 
biological chemistry who was 
the sponsor of the resolution, 
said: The war has damaged the 
quality of life and work at the 
universities, here and else
where. It works against the values 
of devoted scholarship and in
dependent inquiry for whith the 
university stands; it distracts 
and impedes us from our proper 
tasks.
The 150 members who oppos
ed the resolution signed a brief 
statement said that a formal 
vote would jeopardize the univer
sitys freedom, make politics a 
factor in university appoint
ments, force the minority to ac
cept the right of the majority to 
speak for them on matters of con
science and politics, and set a 
precedent that would allow poli
tical matters to come up before 
the faculty regularly.
The signers included Seymour 
Martin Lipset and David Riseman, sociologist; H. Stuart Hu
ghes, historian; Edwin 0. Reischauer, former Ambassador to Ja
pan, and George Kistiakowsky, 
chemist who was a science ad
visor to President Eisenhower.

cept the program thus outlined, 
the. in our opinion, the United 
States should end all support for 
the Saigon Government at once 
and remove all our forces from 
South Vietnam as rapidly as 
ships and planes can carry them 
away.
Cyrus Vance, the Number 
Two negotiator at the Paris 
Peace t.ilks under the Johnson 
administration, said he 
thought the plan was  a very 
constructive program.
Last week the Faculty of Arts 
and Sciences of Harvard Univer
sity called for the prompt, ra
pid, and complete withdrawal 
of United States forces from 
Vietnam and a united and sus
tained national effort to bring 
our troops home.
The motion passed, 255 to 81, 
with 150 absentions, at the end of 
a special meeting. The vote 
followed a similar action by the 
Senate of Columbia Univer
sity.
For the first time the faculty 
of the countrys oldest college 
went on record as opposing a 
Government policy.
As stated in the New York 
Times, It was considered no 
surprise that Harvard profes
sors opposed the war, but the 
fact that they were willing to 
end their traditional neutrality 
on political questions was a meas
ure of the depth of their antag
onism. Many feel the war is pois
oning academic life.
In addition, the faculty pas
sed, 391 to 16, a resolution sup
ported the October 15 Morator
ium and while not commit
ting any individual member, au
thorizes its members to suspend 
classes on that day.
A motion to recess the meeting 
so that professors could vote as 
private individuals without ap
pearing to speak for the univer
sity was offered bu failed by one 
vote,, 215 to 214.
Ceasefire, 
Say New
Mayor Richard C. Lee of New 
Haven and President Kingman 
Brewster of Yale University is
sued a joint statement Friday 
calling for a withdrawal of Am
erican troops from Vietnam. They 
also presented a five-point pro
gram that they said they would 
end the war.
The statement denounced the 
war for its cost in dollars and hu
man lives and its burden of di
vision and aNimony in this 
country.
Our military presence has 
brought neither political free 
choice nor peace to South Viet
nam. Rather, it has meant bomb
ing and burning and maiming 
and dying  with no end in sight, 
the statement said.
The Mayor and University 
President made clear that they 
were speaking as private citi
zens whose constitutencies on 
the campuses and in the cities 
have particularly suffered from 
the unsettling effects of the 
Vietnam War.
They urged the United States 
to adopt the following program:
1. Offer an immediate cease
fire.
2. Declare our fixed intention 
to remove all United States arm
ed forces from South Viet
nam within 12 months of the 
effective date of a ceasefire.
3. Promote the negotiation of 
an election schedule, with 
election supervision, by a coali
tion body in which both sides are 
appropriately represented and in 
which neither dominates.
4. Develop a plan to assist 
any South Vietnamese who wish 
to leave their country.
5. Contribute economic assis
tance to help rebuild a land ra
vaged by war.
Mr. Brewster and Mr. Lee 
criticized the administration as 
having an inactive approach to
Demonstrations against the 
Vietnam War will not only be 
taking place on college campus
es tomorrow. A group of Congress
men have laid plans to keep the 
House of Representative in an 
all-night session tonight. In ad
dition, many Representatives plan 
to speak at rallys all over the na
tion Wednesday.
Although when the Morator
ium was first announced, most 
members of Congress steered 
clear of the movement, they are 
now rallying to the cause.
Seventeen Senators and 47 
House members sent a letter to 
the Vietnam Moratorium Commit
tee endorsing the October 15 
demonstration, providing it re
mains nonvilent.
Some Republicans signed the 
letter against th private advice 
of President Nixon, who at his 
recent news conference said he 
would not be affected what
ever by it.
The all-night session is being 
planned by Representative Ben
jamin Rosenthal of Queens, and 
Andrew Jacobs, Jr. Democrat of 
Indiana. To stage the vigil, the 
critics used a House tradition 
which ways that members may
obtain permission to speak after 
the House has ended its legisla
tive business for the day. Under 
these special orders, a House 
member may speak for up to an 
hour on any subject he chooses.
By late Friday, 16 critics of the 
war had obtained special orders 
to speak for an hour each to
night. after the House finishes con
sideration of Federal pay legisla
tion.
I think it would be a drama
tic symbol to have the House 
lights burning all night, Mr.Rosen 
thal said.
Mr. Rosenthal added that the 
plans for the all-night session 
could still run into parliamentary 
difficulties if supporters of the 
Administrations policies decided 
to use the rules of the House to 
block the protest.
For example, if he chooses. 
Speaker McCormick could close 
the discussion by recognizing a 
member offering a motion to ad
journ after the close of the legis
lative business. But that would 
violate the House tradition that 
the House does not adjourn as 
long as a member with a special 
order is on the floor ready to 
speak.
seeing the conservatives politi
cize the university in their own 
way for the last 10 years.
Professor Lipset was disturb
ed about the setting of prece
dents. Stating that there were 
many horrors in the world, he 
said in an interview that, Once 
you start this, why not come out 
against South African racial pol
icies?
Professor Everett Mendelshoh 
answered saying, Sure there
Ninety-seven per cent of all of 
South Vietnams military forces 
now have M-16 rifles; there 
are enough spare M-16s in the 
country to equip the remainder.
In addition, the United States 
will have withdrawn 60,000 
troops from Vietnam by De
cember 15.
Concerning the budget, Laird 
reported that the Administra
tion has reduced the Johnson ad
ministrations military authoriza
tion request by $6.5 billion 
and cut actual defense spending 
for the fiscal year by more 
than $4 billion.
This makes it possible for 
other sections of our Govern
ment to recognize other high pri
ority items, Mr. Laird contin
ued.
On the draft, Laird said that 
major reforms will be institu
ted effective January 1, includ
ing the induction of primarily 19 
and 20-year-olds to end the un
certainty that now exists about 
draft status.
Mr. Laird said he hoped Con
gress still will approve a random 
selection system or lottery to 
accomplish these goals, but he 
repeated that the reforms will be 
initiated by Presidential order if 
necessary.
Draft calls for November and 
December have been cancelled. 
The Administration's problem is 
that the war protests are pick
ing up steam after being relati
vely quiet during the early 
months of the present Adminis
tration. In the meantime, Nixon 
still feels he needs public sup
port in order to influence Hanoi 
to make concessions a the Paris 
peace talks.
Asked to comment on the Mora
torium, Laird said, We re
cognize the right to dissent in a 
responsible and legal fashion. 
We only hope that those who 
dissent from the policy will 
also be well informed about 
what that policy is.

Professor Riseman said that he 
thought the statement would 
have a negative effect on ending 
the war. He said, If I thought 
it would reduce the war by 24 
hours, I would say, All right, 
one good principle has to give 
way to another good principle.
Defense Secretary Melvin Laird 
took advantage of a press con
ference Thursday to try to win 
public understanding and sup
port for the Administrations pro
gram of Vietnamization  turn
ing more responsibilities over to 
the South Vietnamese to pave the 
way for continued United States 
tropp withdrawals.
Mr. Laird emphasized moves 
the Nixon Administration has tak
en since Nixon was inaugurated 
January 20.
He reported that the South 
Vietnamese are making ex
cellent progress. Half of the 
riverine operations in the Me
kong Delta have been turned over 
to the South Vietnamese by the 
U. S. Navy.
Additional units of the Viet
namese air force have recently 
received jets and are assuming 
more air support, Laird said.

Old Men coasted to an easy 
victory after posting a 25-3 halftime lead.
SAE lost to PKA 44-24 in a 
first round playoff game. The 
score was 20-19 in favor of SAE 
at the half but in the second half 
the PKA defense held SAE to 
only four first downs and no 
TDs.
ATO defeated EJ Panthers 26- 
15 in their playoff game before 
they lost the semifinal game to 
PKA. The game was primarily a 
defensive contest until the second 
half when ATO got a big lead in 
the third period. The EJ Pan
thers tried to pull it out in the 
last period but the ATO defense 
held.
After SN defeated Older Men 
55-0 in the playoff for second 
place in the Browns League, 
SN couldnt get the same defense 
going against BTP-A. BTP-A 
defeated SN 43-13 and held the 
lead all the way.
The Oakland As won the Jag 
League Championship by com
pleting the season undefeated, 
4-0.
The small CMU squad has been 
hit with a number of injuries 
thus far which have magnified 
the shortage of manpower, while 
severely effecting the teams per
formance. Tight end, Tony Bugel 
has been out with a sprained an
kle, halfback Tom Lombardo has 
been playing with an injured 
thigh, and Bill Halsted has hurt 
his knee, to name a few. But the 
Tartans have been able to bounce 
back in previous years and this 
week would be a very opportune 
time.

some of its top football players to 
graduation. Others didnt come out 
for various reasons. This has caus
ed the Gators to employ many 
freshman while forcing a few lettermen to go both ways.
Tomorrow is Alleghenys home

Greenberg and Garver Discuss 
Universitys Vietnam Involvement
mr gUWV"U -v4V4
At 2:00 p.m. yesterday in the 
ballroom a discussion on the uni
versity Military Comples took 
place between David Greenburg 
and Paul Garver.
Greenburg of the physics de
partment was the first to speak. 
The beginning of his talk was 
about the lessons that the war 
has taught those who have op
posed it. We have come to view 
the War as something other than 
an isolated blunder by our policy
makers. We see it as a typical 
example of U. S. foreign policy  
even if you balk at calling it im
perialism, the fact of workdwide U. S. business and strategic 
interests and a demonstrated 
willingness to defend them mili
tarily cannot be ignored.
The universities have been 
highly mobilized for war. Scien
tific research has been used for
the development of new mili
tary techniques of combat and 
reconnaisence. The massive student-faculty discontent over the 
war is contrasted with the fact 
that back in the labs, research 
is going on for the next year and 
the next war. 400 million dollars 
has been granted universities for 
contracts in military research and 
development. The universities 
have come to depend on these 
contracts, and therefore on mili
tary research.
Increasingly, the universities 
have become sensitive to the 
military complex and its money, 
and they are reluctant to jeopard
ize this source.
Paul Garver, Department of 
History, talked about the indus
trial side of the university-military-industrial triangle. Pitts
burgh is an important city to the 
military and industrial com
plex. Here are located many 
of the major industries that sup
ply the materials for war. De
fence relies heavily on this sup
ply. But the bond works the 
other way, too. As American cor
porations become increasingly in
ternational and with large holdings 
in other countries, they depend on 
the U. S. military to defend them 
against outside threats. In some 
respects, it is as if we have crea
ted a large private army to pro
tect private holdings.
How is C-MU connected to 
this military-industrial com
plex? One of its primary bonds is 
through the Board of Trustees. 
By and large, the Board is con
servative and largely made up of 
businessmen whose companies 
are those involved in production 
of war materials. A large pro
portion work directly or indirec
tly for the Mellons

memorable day for C-MU students

2. Girls and guyswear color
ful outfits to fit the occasion. 
(Surely you can find that horendous shirt with the pink flamingoes

Skibo  socialize and have fun!
4. Note: For those who eat in 
the ballroom, dineer will be serv
ed in a true Polynesian style  on

delay in the publishing of the 
C-Book, the school directory. As 
most students noticed when regis
tering this past fall, there has been 
a change in the form of the per
mit to register. In the process of 
changing to the new registration 
form, unusually long delays have 
been added in the registrars 
attempt to supply us with in
formation.
At this time it looks as if it 
will be Nov. 15 at the earliest 
before we will be able to make 
this information available to the 
campus. We regret the inconven
ience that this causes the users 
of the C-Book; administration, 
faculty, staff and students alike, 
however these problems are be
yond our control. Meanwhile, 
students who have had any 
changes in address or phone num
ber since registration should 
send these changes to C-Book/ 
A Phi 0 / Box 100-Campus Mail. 
We will try to get this informa

Moratorium
The type of non-violent ac

mendable but also sorely need

Senator Mark O. Hatfield
The Vietnam Moratorium is 
the most significant demonstra
tion of opposition to the war in 
Vietnam since the primary re
sults of 1968. It is the only way 
that people of the country can 
demonstrate a second judgement 
on the war in Vietnam to those 
who hold political power.
Senator Eugene J. McCarthy
Everyone who has been lec

of violence should welcome this

take his picture. Carol and I left 
the elevator and went to one of 
the elevators that still worked. 
It only went to the 12th floor (I 
had to go to the 17th.) We met 
a young boy who was lost and 
we showed him how to get to 
the 17th floor. He looked so young 
that I found it hard to realize 
that he was to be processed too. 
He would be formed into one of 
those valiant killers that other 
people like to glorify. I almost 
cried.
Now Im sitting in room 1716 
waiting to dy my thing, and 
Carol is looking for the cafeteria. 
I sat and wait and read and feel 
sad looking at the young kids 
going to fight our fucking war.
After a while I look up and see 
Joel, Bob, and Mark standing in

eria where she could wait. As 
reading material for the day I 
had brought two government 
documents: Status of U.S. Stra
tegic Power, Civilian Casualty, 
Social Welfare and Refugee Prob
lems in South Vietnam, (how 
poetic); and two paperbacks: 
Identity, Yough and Crisis, 
and Handbook for Conscientious 
Objectors. (How appropriate.) 
Carol was carrying a couple of 
them and as we entered I asked 
some uniformed men if there was 
a place where someone could 
wait. He said no. The way he 
said it made me sure he was ly
ing. I told Carol that I thought he 
was and that we should ask some
one else. We walked toward the 
elevators and when the man yelled 
to stop I ignored him. We went 
into an elevator with a few other 
people and the man yelled, You, 
with the handbills stop!
Another Uniformed man threw 
his body against the closing door, 
made the other people get out of 
the elevator and then 
had a maintenance man do some

the doorway. I go and talk to 
them. They came down to see me 
but they didnt march with the 
demonstrators because theyre not 
into that type of thing. They were 
in the lobby and heard those 
uniformed men calling us dirty 
communists (wrong on both 
counts) and making comments on 
the flags we were earring (one 
was red with a green tree on it.) 
We talked for a while and then 
we shook hands and said goodby. 
We had known each other for 
four years and now, after gradua
tion, we were each going into 
our own separate life styles. I 
sat there and read and waited 
and two more people came to 
visit me. The next development 
is a big black guy dressed Like 
Deputy Dawg carrying a staff 
and sporting an assortment of madallions, peace symbols, and anti
war buttons.
He walkes in, sits down and 
starts moaning. The he starts 
talking to the group. He tells us 
that he had come but that he 
wouldnt be inducted. He says if 
the didnt go home his old 
lady would die. Then he comes 
over to me and asks, Are they 
your boys outside? We talked for 
a few minutes and he says if 
his physical condition didnt keep 
him out than his tracts would  
he was coming donw, and it didnt 
look good.) With that he pulls out 
his harp and started playing 
real blues. Hed play for a few 
minutes then stop and say, Man, 
like you ask me why I play 
the blues. Then hed tell us 
about how sick he was. Then play 
some more  then talk some more. 
I was sitting nodding my head 
and tapping my foot when some 
soldier came in and took my
Stever Memo 
About Oct. 15
(Editor's Note: The following
memo was sent to Deans Coop
er, Cyert, Mullins, Rice, Stein
berg and Swank concerning the 
October 15 Moratorium from 
President Stever.
As you know, a national ef
fort is being made to have col
leges and universities partici
pate in a moratorium on the us
ual campus activities so that stu
dents and faculty who wish to 
may engage in discussions and 
other educational activities re
garding the Vietnam War.
Classes at C-MU will be held 
as scheduled on October 15. 
However, for those students and 
faculty who wish to organize 
or participate in discussions on 
that day, the University is making 
space available. Skibo Ballroom is 
being reserved for this purpose, 
and we shall try to free smaller 
areas in Skibo as they may be 
needed. Would each dean please 
designate a room or two where 
faculty and students in his col
lege may hond discussion meet
ings if they wish to?

friend away because he was 
making noise. As he left he look
ed at me and flashed the V 
sign. I flashed it back and wish
ed him good luck. I hope he 
made it. He played good harp.
Then a soldier came in and 
yelled at me for putting my foot 
on the chair. Then a soldier 
named Lloyd came in to process 
us. Twice he inspected what I 
was reading. The second time he 
asked me, Are these published 
by the government?
My processing materials were 
different from everyone elses 
in the following respects:
1) I was the only one to have 
Immediate Induction typed on 
my notice.
2) There was a letter explain
ing my refusal to complete those 
forms at my physical.
3) In spite of my refusal to 
complete the forms, they had an
swered no to the question 
asking if I had every been arrest
ed.
4) The form that they told me 
would be sent to notify me if I 
had passed the physical was still 
there.
After an hour or so of proces
sing we all went for a check 
physical. That consisted of tak
ing our cloths off, waiting in line 
to have a doctor sign a paper, 
and putting our clothes back on. 
Back to room 1716  more proces
sing and Lloyd tries to get me to 
fill out those forms again. After 
most of the processing was done 
I was called out away from the 
rest and sent to see Sgt. Street. 
Street seemed mixed up. He 
gave me a copy of good old 
DD form 398 to fill out. I told 
him I had already done it. He 
went and found it. He read it 
and didnt seem to like the part 
in the last question where I said 
that my loyalty to this country 
(or any other) was less strong 
than my respect for human life. 
He looked at me very seriously 
and said that I had a qualified 
398. (Oh! Wow!!) He even had 
to call someone else to ask what 
to do. Then he told me that if I 
had a qualified 398 he would have 
to type five copies of it and that 
would take a long time because 
he was a bad typist. Then he 
looked at me quizically for 
about thirty seconds. I started 
back and then said, O.K. He 
said hed do it after lunch. I 
went and ate, talked to Carol and 
called my mother to let her know 
everything was O.K.
After lunch I had to sit there 
while Sgt. Street typed all those 
jag answers (five copies yet) 
for permanant record.
Well, then, at least, I got to 
see the shrink. For about ten 
minutes we talked about th 
question of aggression being in
nate and the origion of guilt 
and what my father did for a 
living, etc, etc. This guy was a 
civilian and he told me that the 
decision as to whether I was 
qualified (i.e. sane enough to be 
in the arym) or not was made by
the military doctor. The military 
doctor seemed pissed-off that I 
was there at all. He looked at his 
assistant and complained, Who 
authorized this? The assistant 
shrugged his shoulders and 
said, Regulations. The doc
tor said I was O.K. without even 
talking to me.
Im back in room 1716. The 
only people left are those that 
have passed everything. The 
only thing left is induction. Im 
nervous. I just want it over so 
I can leave. Lloyd tells us how 
to get ready. Everything out of 
your pockets, sleeves down, draft 
card in shirt pocket (he looks at 
me and says If you dont have 
it dont worry.) etc. I do it all. 
He calls our names in order and 
we line up. After everyone else 
is called he looks at me and 
says, You go too, Burgess. I 
forced myself to smile at him. 
We arch into this room filled 
with flags. Im in back. One at 
a time our names are called and 
we take a step forward into the 
army. Not me. When I refuse 
theres a soldier tapping me on 
the shoulder. Out I go. I talk to 
a soldier then back to the flag 
room for a second chance (reg
ulations!) As I go in I see Carol 
out in the hall crying and I smile 
at her. I refuse again. They say 
I can leave. I go out and float 
down the elevator, home to eat 
and then drive Carol to the air
port. I have never felt so free 
before in my life. It is that point 
where nothing in the future mat
ters. There is no question about 
feeling right or thinking it is
right---AM that. I go home to
calm down and if the FBI walks 
in right then to take me to jail I 
would only smile.
Since then the only thing that 
has happened was that the FBI 
called once to talk to me. I had 
expected to be indicted in Sepember but it appears that the Jus
tice (sic) Department is more be
hind than I had expected. No 
complaints here. In the meantime 
Im enjoying everything I read, 
drink, smoke or kiss. Thats IT.
The only other thing Id like 
to tell people is that I make no 
decisions about my stand for the 
future. You can only make a 
decision when actually faced 
with it. Im very sure that every 
decision Ive made about the 
draft was the best for me at 
that time. Returning my draft 
card was the most important and 
best decision of my life. Right 
now, behaviorally, that part of 
my life isnt very important but 
I realize some day it will be be
cause of what I face.
There is no way to peace. 
Peace is the way.
Love.

Harriers Tie Titans
Jon Manon won his fourth 
straight race to remain undefeat
ed as the Tartans tied West
minster 28-28 on Saturday. Jons 
time of 24:18 broke the course 
record by twenty seconds.
The harriers were victims of 
rare circumstances: aside from 
the fact that ties almost never 
occur in the sport, one Carnegie 
runner became lost on the strange 
course in New Wilmington. He 
dropped from potential second to 
a point where he could not 
score.

Midway through the first 
quarter, Westminsters Rich Hancox picked off a pass and raced 
73 yards down the sidelines for 
the first score. John Ebersberger 
kicked the first of his six extra
points.
Three touchdowns within a 
five minute span in the second 
quarter broke the game open. 
Joe Veres capped an 86 yard 
march with a 12 yard run over 
right tackle. Two minutes later. 
Bob Power swept end for a 44 
yard TD. Veres ended the scor
ing for the half with an 18 yard 
run.
Westminster scored again on 
a freak play shortly after the 
second half began. CMU was on 
its 13 yard line and Squires drop
ped back to pass but could not 
find a receiver. He was hit by 
a Titan lineman and spun around 
in the endzone and taclke Bill 
Reaver took the ball from him 
for a touchdown.
With its running game stop
ped by the Westminster de
fense, CMU went to the air in 
the second half with better suc
cess. Mike Kuhnel, again subbing 
for injured Tony Bugel, caught 
two passes for 27 yards to set up 
the Tartans first touchdown 
which came on a 28 yard pass to 
Chuck Price.
After Craig McNamara kick
ed a 29 yard field goal to make 
it 38-6, SMU scored on an 
86 yard drive. Rudy Tepsic made 
a good grab on the two yard 
line to set up Squires TD pass 
to Terry Bell.
When the Tartans got the ball 
again, the promptly marched 75 
yards for the score. Chris O
Leary, a regular safety in the 
CMU defensive unit, caught a
23 yard pass for the six points.

One of the bigger surprises 
was Joe Lorhan. Previously known 
for his middle-distance running, 
he put together his fastest mile, 
two-mile, and three mile (4:56, 
10:31, 16:59) to finish third for 
Carnegie in 25:56. He was edged 
by a freshman, Pete Hoysan, 
who is a bit more consistant at 
distances.
The Tartans travel to St. Fran
cis on Saturday for another 
tough meet. The previous hold
er of the Westminster course re
cord was the No. 1 man from 
St. Francis who ran the course 
earlier in the season when his 
team gave the Titans their only 
loss. The Carnegie record is now 
2-1-1.

Soccer Team Upsets Indiana 
For 3rd Win,- Palme Scores 4
The CMU soccer team boos
ted their record to 3-1-1 by de
feating Indians 5-1 after bat
tling St. Vincent to a 3-3 tie. 
Tartan co-captain Henrik Palme 
scored six goals in the two 
games.
Last Wednesday, the trip to 
St. Vincent resulted in a disap
pointing 3-3 deadlock. The lead 
changed three times during the
course of the game with CMU 
having the advantage most of 
the time. However, the failure 
of the offense and defense to 
communicate effectively denied 
CMU the win. Scoring twice for 
the Tartans was Henrik Palme 
with the third goal by freshman 
Bob Moroz.

stunned Indiana University 5-1 
on Saturday. A 1-1 halftime score 
broke open in the third quarter 
with Palme running up the amaz
ing total of four goals and Moroz 
adding the fifth. The defense, 
headed by co-captain Jake Eisenman, effectively thwarted In
diana's drives and set up the of
fensive scoring for CMU. Con
tributing immensely to this de
fensive effort were the finger
tip saves of goalie Jacques Borisweitz.
Indiana was heavily favored. 
CMU scorer players attribute 
their success in the upset to 
communication and teamwork. They 
will have to employ these tech
niques to the utmost in the re
maining five home games against 
such formidable opponents as 
Slippery Rock, Marietta. Grove 
City, Pitt-Johnstown, and Pitt
