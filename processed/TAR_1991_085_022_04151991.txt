AIESEC, a Carnegie Mellon student 
.business organization, sent two students 
to Ronneby, Sweden over spring break, 
from March 24-29.
Lisa Leonardo and Lisa Koscielny, 
members of AIESEC-Pittsburgh, at
tended the European North American 
Leadership Development Seminar, bet
ter known as ENALDS.
ENALDS is an annual symposium of 
about 300 students from 27 countries. In
a five-day program, in which 280 stu
dents participated this year, AIESEC 
enhanced international understanding 
and cooperation through a concentrated
leadership development seminar.
Leonardo, a sophomore industrial 
management major, and Koscielny, a 
sophomore double majoring in informa
tion systems andindustrial management, 
received training on project management, 
corporate development, public speaking, 
and how to train others effectively.
The Scandinavian management sym
posium introduced us to the philosophy 
behind Swedish management. This in
cluded a lecture on the origins and ideas 
of IKEA, a Swedish-based furniture com
pany which has one of its 93 stores lo
cated in Pittsburgh, said Leonardo.
On top of the leadership and interac
tion skill-building, both students received 
training that cannot be taught in a
textbook, said Koscielny. She looks back 
on the seminar as a very personal and 
heartfelt experience.
Leonardo and Koscielny brought back 
information on how the international 
AIESEC chapters are run. This is infor

Judith Resnik Award for 1991.
The award is given each year to a 
graduating senior woman in the Carn
egie Institute of Technology, the Mellon 
College of Science, or the School of Com
puter Science. It recognizes academic 
performance, creativity, and vision illus
trating potential for high academic 
achievement in her field and a contribu
tion to her wider community, according 
to Associate Provost for Academic

Projects Barbara Lazarus.
Im honored, especially because 
[Resnik] was an engineer, and I am a 
scientist, said Costello. I think its won
derful that the award recognizes scien
tists, and not just engineers.
Associate Professor of Chemistry 
Charles Van Dyke, who nominated 
Costello for the award, said, I think the 
committee made an excellent choice. 
[Costello] has been an exceptionally ac

the Small Undergraduate Research 
Grant (SURG) recipients for the sum
mer and fall of 1991.
In keeping with Carnegie Mellons 
emphasis on independent research, the 
SURG program, coordinated by the Of
fice of the Associate Provost for Aca
demic Projects, was developed to sup
port qualified undergraduate students 
who wish to independently pursue re
search topics outside of their normal 
undergraduate curriculum. In the case
of CFA students, the research consists 
of independent creative projects.
Interested students must complete a 
proposal application and include an item
ized budget for their projects. Proposals 
are judged upon the objective of the re
search, the projects significance, the 
project design, the students background 
in the field, the form of the presentation 
of th final product, and the process by 
which the project will be evaluated, said 
Lazarus.

92 budget cuts programs
WASHINGTON  The House 
Budget Committee approved a 
fiscal 1992 budget plan that would 
cut many programs by 1 percent 
while increasing spending on se
lected social programs as a politi
cal challenge to President Bush.
On a voice vote, the panel ap
proved a budget resolution that 
sets federal outlays at $1.46 tril
lion and anticipates a near-record 
deficit of $289.6 billion for the 
year that begins October 1. The 
outlays would grow by $66 billion 
from the current year, for which 
the deficit is projected to hit a 
record $299.9 billion.
The resolution, which is not 
binding, is expected to be approved 
by the House as early as next 
week.
Before passing its measure, the 
committee yesterday rejected the
Presidents budget proposal as 
well as two other plans that would 
have cut projected spending more 
deeply than the adopted version.
The committees resolution ad
heres to the strict spending ceil
ings imposed by last years bud
get accord and doesnt call for any 
tax increases to narrow the defi
cit.
The measure does project that 
the annual deficit will be gradu
ally reduced over time.
The document, whose outline 
was drafted by the committees 
Democratic majority, reflects sig
nificant restraint on spending. 
Cuts of 1 percent were applied to 
selected housing, transportation, 
and agriculture programs, for 
example.
In addition, some programs, 
such as those for space explora
tion, would get smaller increases 
than proposed.
Spending growth above the lev
els sought by the President was 
proposed for various programs 
that the Democrats hope to use 
for political advantage.
But the changes from the 
Presidents proposals were rela
tively small  a fact that Repub
licans on the panel delighted in 
highlighting. Of the roughly $200 
billion in domestic spending ap
propriated annually, the 
committees bill recommends that 
only $10 billion, or 5 percent, be 
placed in categories other than 
those the President chose.
The budget resolution doesnt 
foreclose the possibility of tax in
creases later in the year to pay for 
specific new programs or tax 
breaks.
CBO: Dont cut Social Security tax
WASHINGTON (AP)  Cutting Social Security 
taxes would sharply reduce the nations alreadylow rate of saving, boost interest rates, and gener
ally slow the economy, the Congressional Budget 
Office said today.
CBO economists, in a report to the Senate Fi
nance Committee, said various Social Security taxcut proposals being considered by Congress would 
weaken savings by boosting the federal deficit.
The report explained that the reduced savings 
would be expected because a bigger federal deficit 
uses up more of the available supply of saving, 
forcing interest rates upward and reducing produc
tive investment.
The report went on to say, The decline in invest
ment eventually reduces the growth of GNP by 
making less machinery, factories, infrastructure,
and other productive capital available.
The study suggested interest rates could rise by 
as much as one-half of a point and the savings rate 
could drop by as much as six-tenths of a point.
Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D-Texas), chairman of the 
Finance Committee, used the report to restate his 
opposition to a Social Security tax cut.
On top of the economic threat is the threat to 
Social Security when you talk about cutting the tax 
that supports it, Bentsen said.
The most popular tax-cut plan, written by Sen. 
Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-New York), would 
reduce the current 6.2 percent Social Security tax 
rate to 5.2 percent by 1996.
Moynihan justifies his proposal by'pointing out 
that Social Security taxes are being borrowed now 
to fund other programs.
Cheney recommends 43 
military base closings by 95
WASHINGTON (AP)Defense Secretary Dick 
Cheney is recommending the closure of 31 major 
domestic military bases and 12 minor installa
tions as well as the realignment of 28 others, 
according to documents obtained Friday by The 
Associated Press.
By 1995, the number of people in the U.S. 
military will be about one-fourth smaller than it 
is today. Smaller forces need fewer bases. Its as 
simple as that, Cheney said in a statement.
The estimated cost of closing the 31 major 
domestic military bases and 12 minor installa
tions is $5.7 billion from fiscal 1992 to fiscal 1997 
while the savings will amount to about $6.5 
billion.
That means a net gain of $850 million, the 
Pentagon said.
Among the major facilities on the list to be 
closed are Fort McClellan in Anniston, Ala.; Fort 
Ordin Seaside, Calif.; Fort Benjamin Harrison in 
Indianapolis, Ind.; Fort Devens in Ayer, Mass., 
and Fort Dix in Wrightstown, N.J. These are all 
Army installations.
The nine Navy bases slated for closure are the 
Philadelphia Naval Shipyard in Pennsylvania; 
Naval Station Long Beach in California; Hunters 
Point Annex of Naval Station Treasure Island in 
San Francisco, Calif.; Naval Air Station Moffett 
Field in Sunnyvale, Calif.; the Naval Training 
Center in Orlando, Fla.; the Naval Station in 
Philadelphia; the Naval Air Station Chase Field 
in Beeville, Texas; Naval Station Puget Sound in 
Seattle and the Whidbey Island Air Station in 
Oak Harbor, Wash.
Air Force bases slated for closure include Eaker 
Air Force Base in Blytheville, Ark.; Lowry Air 
Force Base in Denver, Colo.; Grissom Air Force 
Base in Peru, Ind.; and Wurtsmith Air Force Base 
in Oscoda, Mich.
The lone Marine Corps facility slated for clo
sure is the Air Station Tustin in El Toro, Calif.
The recommendations Im making today are 
based on a review by each of the service secretar 
ies of their basing requirements, in light of the, 
planned reductions in the force and the selection, 
criteria under the law. This list is the result of 
those reviews and reflects their proposals, Cheney, 
said.
The Pentagon chiefs list now goes to an eightmember, independent commission, which can 
either accept or amend the recommendations, 
before forwarding it to President Bush on July 1..
The President has until July 15 to decide _ 
whetherto accept the list or reject it in its entirety , 
before sending it to Congress for approval.
In the last round of base closures in 1989, 
Congress approved the shutdown of 86 domestic - 
installations.
The base closure process applies to domestic" 
facilities only. Defense Secretary Cheney has the7 
authority to shut down foreign installations and ' 
in his statement said the Pentagon is undertak-. 
ing plans to end or reduce its operations at 198 ' 
overseas sites.
Even before Cheyney announced the list, i 
charges of partisan politics surfaced in Congress.
I dont know what those people are thinking 
about but it almost looks like the Democratic  
strongholds have been hit the worst, said Rep. 
Joe Moakley (D-Mass.), who complained about 
the proposed closure of Fort Devens.
Representitive Moakley cited the recommended 
closures in Washington state, home of House 
Speaker Thomas Foley (D-Wash.); Pennsylva
nia, home of House Democratic Whip Bill Gray; < 
and California, home to Rep. Vic Fazio, head of  
the Democratic Congressional Campaign Com-, 
mittee.
There is a treachery here, frankly, said Sen.*

Bush administration proposes plan to aid Kurdish and Shiite refugees
WASHINGTONThe Bush adminis
tration, still scrambling to deflect charges 
that it has abandoned Kurds and Shiites 
in Iraq, is preparing a multimillion-dollar aid package to help Iraqi refugees 
fleeing their governments wrath.
There still is disagreement within the 
administration about the timing and 
precise procedures to use in seeking the 
aid, and some officials argue that funds 
can be found without a separate new bill 
that might raise technical budget prob
lems, aides said. But the administration 
prjvately has informed congressional ap
propriations committees that they should 
expect a supplemental aid bill. In a letter 
this week to House Appropriations Chair
man Jamie Whitten (D-Miss.) regarding 
another matter, White House budget 
director Richard Darman referred to our 
forthcoming supplemental request for
Iraqi refugees and displaced persons.
The administration has privately dis
cussed an aid proposal totaling about 
$150 million to $200 million, officials 
said. The proposal would cover the U.S. 
contribution to a new international drive 
to help refugees along the Turkish and 
Iranian border, as well as funds for di
rect American assistance.
Such an aid package is politically ap
pealing to the administration. It could 
prevent Congressional Democrats from 
embarrassing the administration by pro
posing their own plan.
Democratic Sen. Patrick Moynihan of 
New York announced that he is intro
ducing a bill that would authorize $50 
million in humanitarian aid to Iraqi 
Kurds and call on the administration to 
take effective measures under the 
United Nations charter to prevent Iraqi
government attacks on civilians.
In the wake of the U.S.-led war that 
ignited the unrest inside Iraq, Demo
crats are becoming increasingly bold in 
declaring that the U.S. has a responsibil
ity at least to protect Iraqs Kurds and 
Shiites.
For one thing, administration critics 
have urged President Bush to order Iraq 
to stop using helicopter gunships to at
tack Kurdish and Shiite rebels and refu
gees fleeing the violence inside Iraq. But 
administration officials yesterday said 
Iraq has substantially reduced its use of 
the helicopters, perhaps in response to 
pressure from the U.S. and other coun
tries.
Deputy Defense Secretary Donald 
Atwood told Congressional leaders about 
the drop in Iraqi helicopter activity at a 
White House meeting yesterday, offi
cials said.
While movingto provide more humani
tarian aid to Iraqi refugees, the adminis
tration was wary of a proposal to estab
lish U.N.-sponsored enclaves to give the 
Iraqi citizens a haven from their govern
ment. The proposal, which emerged last 
weekend and is being pushed hard by 
British Prime Minister John Major, is 
being debated at the U.N. as a way of 
protecting Shiite and Kurdish citizens of 
Iraq without becoming directly involved 
in fighting the Iraqi government.
But the Bush administration is wor
ried that establishment of enclaves could 
lead to the dismemberment of Iraq or to 
a U.S. military entanglement with Iraq.
White House spokesman Marlin 
Fitzwater said only that the U.S. is dis
cussing the enclave idea and that we 
think it has some merits in terms of a
possible solution or a possible partial 
solution, at least. But he added, I doni 
believe anybody has a final judgment od 
whether or not we want to go ahead with 
it.
Meanwhile, Defense Secretary Dick 
Cheney said the U.S. is considering plani 
to leave enough equipment in Saud 
Arabia to equip a U.S. armored division 
The pre-positioning, he said, is being 
designed to reduce the amount of time 
needed to mobilize U.S. forces in an emer-1 
gency.

RESNIK, from page 1
"[Costello] was spectacular. Her 
nomination by Van Dyke was 
simply shining.
The criteria for nomination 
are strict, according to Lazarus, 
with the most limiting factor 
being that each department in 
CIT, MCS, and SCS can nomi
nate only one candidate.
That means there were only 
about 10 applications, said 
Lazarus.
Costello spent time with thenCMU professor Barbara 
Imperiali on an undergraduate 
research project in bio-organic 
chemistry. When Imperiali 
moved to Cal Tech, Costello re
ceived a National Science Foun
dation grant, and worked with 
her again at Cal Tech in the 
spring of 1990.
[Costello] has an impressive 
list of achievements, said Van 
Dyke. Along with her work at 
the California Institute of Tech
nology, she has given seminars 
to the CMU Chemistry Depart
ment, been recognized by sev
eral organizations including the 
American Chemical Society, and 
was a 1990 Andrew Carnegie 
Society Scholar.
Costello, who was accepted to 
graduate schools at MIT, Duke, 
Johns Hopkins, Cornell, and the 
University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill, plans to attend 
Cornell to study bio-organic 
chemistry in the fall. After
ward, Id like to stay in an aca
demic field, but I have to wait 
and see, she said.
As her letter of recommenda
tion from Van Dyke states, She 
has the enthusiasm, ability and 
exposure to an extremely im
portant area of research in bio
chemistry and will quickly es
tablish a reputation as an out
standing scientist.... She is one 
of the most creative, talented, 
and enthusiastic students I 
have known, and [she] will be a 
real credit to our university and 
the chemistry profession.

Correction...
Last weeks feature photo [PayingTribute...., page 1 ] had an 
incorrect caption. The funeral was for Lt. Terrence Mulkeen, a 
1981 CMU mechanical engineering graduate.
The alma mater of University Professor of Psychology Herbert 
Simon [Professor, Nobel laureate Simon piques curiosity, 
page L3] was incorrectly given. He is a graduate of the Univer
sity of Chicago. Also, Simons autobiography title was incom
plete; the full title is Models of My Life.

We're Looking for Business Partners, 
Not Employees
Software Engineers, Programmers, Software Architects
ntuit, the makers of Quicken, the 3rd best 
J selling application software on the planet 
for Macintosh and IBM computers (behind 
WordPerfect and Lotus 1-2-3), will be conducting 
on-campus interviews for software engineers, 
programmers, and software architects on 
Monday, April 15.
ur software development team is small 
enough to be personable. Yet big enough to 
offer you a challenging variety of programs to 
work on. It is a place where you will enjoy using 
your creative talents. We are responsible for 
honing existing products and developing true 
state-of-the-art new products. We are also 
researching and developing object-oriented 
technology in multi-platform development.
V g ee're looking for individuals who want to 
 make a meaningful contribution to a 
cutting-edge software development department 
with a proven track record of successful 
products. You will be responsible for the design, 
implementation, and ultimate delivery of signifi
cant portions of software products to the con
sumer marketplace, as well as applying your 
design expertise to other product areas. We are 
particularly interested in engineers with strong 
program internals experience. We have a 
number of projects going on and several that are 
just starting out on Macintosh and PC platforms 
in both C and C++. We'd love to talk with you 
and find out what excites you.
( j ualifications. Exceptionally high IQ (but
hey, this is Carnegie Mellon). Bachelor's or 
Master's degree. C or C++, experience with the 
Macintosh or IBM PC's, and previous commer
cial software development experience would be 
outstanding. You must enjoy creating robust, 
maintainable, well-documented, and easy-to-use 
(and therefore not easy to program) code that 
will be sold to and used by millions of users.
User interface design expertise is a definite plus. 
You must be excited about working in small 
teams and taking on responsibilities for large pro
gramming tasks. Oh, yes. We do write product 
specifications, so your Strategies For Writing 
classes weren't a complete waste of time after all.

Lazarus designates small

SURG, from page 1
selection committee comprised of 
administrators from all the col
leges. Lazarus said, We encour
age joint proposals, especially 
those across disciplines, because 
such projects help to bridge the 
gap between departments and 
colleges. Individual departments 
determine whether or not projects 
qualify for academic credit.
Upon completion of the project, 
award winners and their faculty 
sponsors are expected to submit a 
brief final evaluation. Lazarus 
points out that the program 
fund[s] the process, not the prod
uct.... We want the students to 
experience the fun, trials, and 
tribulations of doing [an indepen
dent] research project. Its the 
learning experience thats impor
tant in this.
The amount of the award is 
generally limited to $500 (though 
group projects sometimes receive 
more). SURG is funded by AECO, 
MERCK, Carnegie Bosch Insti
tute, Carnegie Mellons Informa
tion Networking Institute, the
Students have done some incredible 
stuff.
 Barbara Lazarus, 
associate provost
Hewlitt Foundation, Howard 
Hughes Medical Institute, the Lily 
Foundation, and the Eden Hall 
foundation.
Currently only about one-fourth 
to one-third of the applicants are 
named as recipients. Lazarus 
would like to see two-thirds to 
three-fourths of the applicants 
given the funding to pursue their 
projects.
Some students have done some 
incredible stuff, she said. We 
need to be able to let more stu
dents do it. We hope to give [re
cipients] a sense of self-confidence, 
but we need to believe that a 
project is important ... and that 
the student can really do it.
A directory is available to help 
students find faculty who are in
terested in doing research with 
undergraduates. The Directory of

Gym facilities improvements rest 
on shoulders of administration
The Campus Affairs Committee 
of Student Senate has just com
pleted a report concerning gym 
facilities.
The committee surveyed stu
dents who use the gym regularly 
and came up with a list of concerns 
about maintenance of the facili
ties.
That list, along with suggestions 
for improvement, was passed on 
to President Robert Mehrabian, 
Vice President for Enrollment 
William Elliott, and Director of 
Athletics and Physical Education 
John Harvey.
Now the balls in the 
administrations court. And we 
dont want to see it get bogged 
down. The fact that Senate initi
ated this report based on student 
: discontent indicates the serious
ness the administration must 
dedicate.
Some of the problem areas, such 
as the publishing of the hours for 
the pool and the gym, were already 
being addressed prior to the re
port, according to Harvey. We 
are trying to create a bboard that 
people can read to find operating 
hours for the facilities, he said.
For the other areas cited in the 
report, the administration will 
create an Athletic Facility Im
provements Committee (AFIC). It 
will be responsible for investigat
ing the problems, as well as cre. ating and implementing long-term 
solutions.
For the most part, this is a great 
idea, especially if the committee 
acts immediately.
Cleanliness of the locker rooms 
was a major concern listed in the 
report. Sanitation is basic; rem
edying this problem should sit 
right at the top.
The problem of the pool being 
closed at unannounced times may 
be a little more difficult to solve. 
The unexpected shutdowns are 
the result of truant lifeguards. 
Indeed, the staff seems to have 
shown a lot of leniency. 
Lifeguardingis ajob,just like any
other. If a lifeguard doesnt show 
up, he or she should be fired.
Other concerns  repairing 
worn equipment, changing light 
bulbs, installing working water 
fountains, and fixing rooms that 
literally have plaster falling from 
the ceilings  should also be pri
orities for the AFICs attention.
Although the list of improve
ments needed goes on and on, 
there must be a line drawn 
somewhere.
One suggestion in the report 
calls for changing the racquetball 
courts to regulation size. Struc
tural changes of this nature are 
too much.
Plans for the new University 
Center include a lot of recreational 
space: a small gym, a new pool, 
and racquetball and squash 
courts. Of these, only the pool is 
going to be used for competition 
purposes  the rest are for rec
reational use only.
With the amount of money being 
spent on the University Center 
and the number of its new recre
ational facilities, its pointless to 
throw millions of dollars into 
renovating the gym from top to 
bottom, when that money could 
be put toward construction of the 
University Center.
Admittedly, the gym takes a lot 
of abuse, but face it  its a 67- 
year-old building that, on the in
side, looks like its at least 67 
years old. CMU could spend sev
eral million dollars repairing that 
facility and still not be near 
completion. Its just not worth it.
For now, we suggest getting the 
gym into decent shape. Spend the 
money necessary to repair it. But 
dont make any major structural 
changes to the building that would 
be too costly, in light of the pending 
University Center.
Most important, show people 
whats happening to the building 
 show them how conditions are 
improving. Its all up to the ad
ministration now  it just needs 
to pick up the ball and run with it.
Spring Carnivals right around 
the corner, and the campus is 
getting in full swing for the 
Universitys most hectic three 
days.
Amidst all of this weekends fes
tivities, we encourage students to 
remember that another important 
campus event is also underway  
elections for student government 
president and Student Senate.
So, before the action of Carnival 
heats up and after it subsides, 
take the time to decide what 
campus issues are on your mind. 
Then decide who you would like to 
see address them. This is your 
chance to identify some problems 
and take an active role in getting 
them solved.
When youre sitting in Dining 
Service facilities, in your dorm, in 
a classroom, or out on the Cut, 
look around you. Whats bugging 
you? What makes you say, Ive 
always hated it when...?
Once youve targeted the issues, 
turn your attention to the candi
dates for student government 
president, and make a match.
The field of candidates this year 
is large, so the race wont be as 
clear-cut as it has been in the 
past.
Elections are April 24 and 25, so
Letters to the Editor
Coverage of NAMES quilt 
lacked information
Letter to 
the Editor
Get in touch with presidential race
keep your eyes and your ears open 
for the next two weeks to see what 
the candidates are saying on what 
issues.
The presidential debate will take 
place today at 6:30 pm in Porter 
Hall 100. The candidates opening 
statements, responses to panelists 
questions, rebuttals, and closing 
remarks will be broadcast live on 
WRCT.
Also, there will be a questionand-answer period for audience 
participation. Tune in and listen 
 its an excellent way to for you 
to decide who you think is best for 
the job.
Apathy concerning student poli
tics has become a long-standing 
tradition at CMU.
Some recent years have revealed 
pathetic voter turnouts. The trend 
indicates that this year wont be 
much better.
Granted, the numbers arent 
going to skyrocket overnight, but 
we think that they can go nowhere 
but up. But you have to make it 
happen.
Anyone can walk up to a table 
outside Doherty Hall, flash his or 
her identification card, and cast a 
vote. If youre going to vote, cast 
an intelligent, well thought-out 
vote.
Editor:
Hats off to The Tar
tan for yet another fine 
example of its profes
sionalism! Now before 
I continue, let me say 
that I am no journalist. I am just some
one who appreciates good, impartial, 
factual reporting and likes to give praise 
where praise is due.
In Volume 85, Issue 21 of The Tartan 
[4/8/91], the first exemplification I ap
plaud is the newspapers sensible and 
efficient utilization of space: a fall page 
of Calvin and Hobbes cartoons, another 
of Doonesbury comics, and three color 
pictures of two people, wearing the same 
clothes in their respective pictures, lean
ing by what appears to be the same wall, 
in practically the same poses, on page 
LI. And, on page L2, one approximately 
6" x 4" black and white picture of the 
panels made for the Names Project, San 
Francisco, that were displayed on the 
first floor of Hunt Library, from Thurs
day, April 4 to Monday, April 8.
Not to go unacknowledged is The 
Tartans continued commitment to ex
cellence  to borrow a phrase  as it 
strives to inform the CMU community, 
and the parents and alumni who sub
scribe to the paper, of the events that 
help to shape the lives of tomorrows 
leaders. Highly educational and inspir
ing was the following caption that ap
peared under the picture of the panels 
display: The Names Project recently 
sponsored quilt panels display on the 
first floor of Hunt Library. The quilts 
will be on display through today. Cer
tainly, if when you picked up this news
paper you knew nothing about the Quilt, 
which is comprised of panels hand-sewn 
by the lovers, friends, and families of the 
thousands of people world-wide who have 
died from AIDS-related illnesses  
people from all walks of life including 
doctors, teachers, steelworkers, football 
players, engineers, students, hetero
sexuals, gay men, lesbians, bisexuals, 
women, men, babies, Asians, whites, 
Hispanics, blacks, Australians, Germans, 
Americansit was all revealed to you in 
The Tartans twenty-three words. In ad
dition, you can no longer claim to be 
unaware of the fact that the NAMES 
Project is an ongoing effort to publicly 
mourn the loss of loved ones, put names 
behind the bare statistics, raise funds to 
help care for persons with AIDS, and 
uncover the vast blanket of ignorance in 
our societies.
Once again, I am no journalist and 
thus I have no idea what it would have 
entailed to write a newspaper article 
about panels made for the NAMES 
Project Quilt in San Francisco, even if 
there were several pieces of relevant 
literature readily available in the imme
diate area of the display in Hunt Li
brary, and if there were several persons 
from cmuOUT and CMU Lambda Alums 
 the two groups responsible for this 
project, who arranged to have panels 
from the Shepherd Wellness Center in 
Pittsburgh and from the NAMES Project, 
Cleveland, Ohio, displayed along with 
the two panels which were sewn by them; 
the NAMES project did not sponsor the 
display who were directly involved 
with the project; one of whom personally 
informed a Tartan staff member about
the panels before they were actually in
stalled. Since last Monday, someone has 
walked into The Tartan office and re
quested that The Tartan do a story on 
the installation. I will therefore leave 
news coverage to The Tartan.
Keep up the good work!

my parents, sisters, and brother.
If the accident did nothing else, it gave 
me a greater appreciation for life and 
your love. Thank you for everything. I 
love you all.

Lacrosse deserves better 
coverage, fair reporting
we placed ahead of  and the best'clib 
teams in the region, The Tartan chose to 
focus on our narrow defeat in the semifi
nals. Additionally, the article attempted 
to discredit one of our victories with tit 
inaccurate claim that Ohio State did net 
have its entire team present when the) 
played us. For the record, Ohio State hai 
its full squad present by the middle o| 
the first quarter, and our win was by 
decisive five goals.
I sincerely hope that The Tartan will, 
in the future, encourage and celebrate 
the achievements of this schools stu
dents, who do not enjoy the benefit oj 
having a varsity program, rather than 
disappoint and discourage them. Cur
rently, our teams record in regular sea
son play is 5-0, which is second in im
pressiveness only to the CMU football 
team, yet we have not even had one 
photograph in The Tartan this season. 
Last weekend we held the largest club 
event ever at CMU, purchased a half
page ad in The Tartan to promote it, and 
made every attempt to inform the paper 
well in advance, but still we could not 
make the front page. We would appreciate 
it very much if you would in turn give us 
the coverage and credit we deserve.

Womens Center and 
its values, 2/25] which appeared in Tike 
Tartan. It seems useful to offer another 
alumnas perspective, not because 
Hannans letter poses a threat to the 
Womens Center or its work, but because 
her letter displays in distilled form some 
of the fundamental ways in which people 
are hostile to feminism and feminist 
groups. With a view to describing and 
deflecting such hostilities, Id like to fig
ure out why anyone would be as angry as 
Hannan about an institution with which 
she is in no way obligated to interact, and 
which she perceives as ineffectual.
Some of Hannans objections to the 
Womens Center and its work are ex
tremely naive. She implies that femi
nists hate men. She states that feminists 
want to see men become spineless wimps 
and women become a dominant power. 
She implies, with some confusion be
tween equality and sameness, that they 
want to eradicate gender difference; she, 
on the other hand, wants to preserve 
those wonderful qualities that make us 
male and female.
Such mistaken views could be cleared 
up by paying attention to what feminist 
institutions like the Womens Center say 
and do, or by attending any of their 
events. Most feminists are interested in 
celebrating the differences among people) 
and in preventing people  women and 
men  from being forced into categories 
that restrict difference. To claim that 
anyone is superior to anyone on the basis 
of gender or other social categories 
anathema to most forms of feminisi^

Liberals fight idea of PC
yJonathan Levy
While I was home for Spring 
Break, I had a short but inter
esting conversation with one of 
my brothers about political phi
losophy.
He is 18 and a freshman at a 
prominent university. The com
ment he made that really struck 
me is that he is being turned off 
by liberalism. I have to admit 
that I can see his point.
Liberals in this country have 
taken a beating recently. George 
Bush and Lee Atwater managed 
to convince much of America in 
1988 that the L-word was an 
obscenity not to be spoken in front 
of children.
And Michael Dukakis only 
compounded the problem by re
jecting the strategy of defending 
liberals and instead trying to 
pretend he wasnt one.
The Persian Gulf crisis has been 
jyet another setback for liberals, 
ias many Democrats  who are 
not identical to liberals but are 
-associated with them in peoples 
jinds  are suffering the politiconsequences of opposing a 
;pppular and successful war.
,,,, Yet none of this is what made my 
brother, and probably many like 
him, have doubts about liberalism. 
It takes more than a few conser
vatives pushing the right PR but
tons to do that. In fact, it has taken 
liberals themselves  or at least 
people who are thought to be lib
erals  to discredit liberalism.
The big issue that is convincing 
a lot of people, including my 
brother, that modem liberalism 
may not be for them is political 
correctness.
These people admire the civil 
rights movement. They have 
concern for victims of poverty, 
bigotry, and other evils. In most 
ways, they are very comfortable 
with the ideals of liberalism.
But they dont want to be asso
ciated with the reborn McCarthyism they see in the political 
correctness movement and, hon
estly, I cant blame them.
There are people on college 
campuses and in other places 
around this country who are try
ing to persecute and prosecute 
those who express ideas that are 
not politically correct. In most 
cases, they have tried  some
times successfully  to get col
leges and universities to adopt 
punishments for students and 
others who say just about any
thing that could be considered 
offensive to certain groups. These 
groups are usually made up of 
minorities and others who have 
historically been treated less than 
fairly in American society.
Students at various schools 
around the country have been 
disciplined under these rules and 
at least one former student at 
Brown University was expelled.
Since most of the advocates of 
political correctness rules iden
tify themselves as liberals, and 
their actions as being consistent 
with liberalism, the nation is con
vinced that being a liberal means 
supporting the political correct
ness movement.
Conservatives are only too happy 
to agree. They have been handed 
one more issue with which to dis
credit liberalism and, whatever else 
one may say about conservatives, 
they usually know how to look out 
for their own interests.
So, that leaves people like my 
brother wondering if liberalism is 
really for them. How does one 
reconcile agreeing with most of 
liberalism but strongly rejecting 
its position on one of the hottest 
issues of the day?
The answer is simple. There is 
no real conflict. Despite what the 
radicals on one side and the con
servatives on the other would have 
people believe, the political cor
rectness movement is not part of 
real liberalism. It tries to hang on 
to liberalism by emphasizing its 
concern for minorities and other 
traditionally oppressed groups, 
but its attack on freedom of ex
pression gives it away.
Many of the people who make up 
the political correctness movement 
take traditionally liberal stances 
on other issues, but as a group 
whose common thread is conduct
ing a witch hunt to suppress the 
free exchange of ideas, they should 
not be called liberals.
And, as a liberal myself, Id like 
to ask the supporters of political 
correctness to move away from me 
on the political spectrum because 
they are scaring away the people 
Id rather be associated with.

Even job-hunters have values
Kevin Barney
This past week found me walk
ing through the jungles of West 
Virginia in search of a job. Yes, 
Im a senior and the only thing 
that I have written down on my 
calendar after May 19 is Sober 
up.
Anyway, I was wandering 
around the jungles of West Vir
ginia looking for anything job-related  I really didnt want to 
become a member of the McJobs 
program  when I ran into this 
hunter/hillbilly/redneckAVest Vir
ginia voter with his gun and his 
black Labrador retriever.
He introduced himself to me as 
Jimmy Bob, the smartest guy who 
ever joined the KKK.
I thought to myself, His IQ must 
be up around 40. Maybe I should 
interview him. I could sell the story 
to a local paper and maybe this will 
turn into a job.
So I got my pencil and paper out 
and Jimmy Bob got a fresh wad of 
tobacco under his lip. I hit him 
with the first question, Why did 
you join the KKK?
He spit a nice juicy wad of to
bacco excrement towards me and 
replied,
Makes me civilized. Without 
it, us hicks would be nothing but
barbarians.
Before I could ask another ques
tion his dog proceeded to urinate 
on my leg, which Jimmy thought 
was the funniest thing since the 
United States shot down an Iranian 
passenger plane.
So, why do you guys dislike the 
blacks?
Jimmy belched, took a fresh beer 
out of his back pocket and took a 
long drag before answering, 
Cause theyre not normal. They 
aint white.
I responded faster than he could 
sip it: Asians arent white. 
American Indians arent white. 
Hispanics arent white. Why the 
blacks?
He scratched himself and then 
took his shotgun and fired both 
barrels over my shoulder, hitting 
a tree.
Sorry. I saw a squirrel and 
just had to hit it. Hit him dead 
center.
Maybe if you used a smaller 
gun, there would be something 
left over to take home.
Why would I want to take dead 
animals home? My kids have 
enough toys.
I brushed a bit of squirrel gut 
off my shoulder and repeated my 
last question.
Well, we have to have pri
orities. Blacks are our first. 
Then we go after everyone 
else.
I scared myself. I actually considered 
his offer for a second. Then I gave 
him my answer,; "Sorry, I have a good 
job that I don't want to leave."
So, the only good people are 
white people.
But they have to be good 
Christian white people to be truly 
good.
What about your dog?
Jimmy looked down at his dog, 
who was busy cleaning a certain 
part of his body.
What about im? Hes the best 
damn dog in the whole damn 
state.
I smiled. Hes not white. Hes 
black. How can a black dog be 
better than a white dog, if a white 
person is always better than a 
black person?
Jimmy thought about this. He 
scratched his head, knocking his 
John Deere cap to the ground. 
Then the logic hit him and his jaw 
dropped.
The soggy mass of tobacco  
that some people call enjoyable 
fell to his chest, where it proceeded 
to roll down across his beer belly, 
finally falling to the ground with 
a splurp noise.
That damn dog!! He reloaded 
his shotgun and aimed it straight
at the dog.
He fired and missed and the 
dog took off like a black bat out of 
a white hell. Before he could re
load, the dog had made it to the 
safety of Maine.
After reloading his mouth, 
Jimmy turned to me, Youre smart 
for an out-of-state boy. You want a 
job? I own the biggest factory in 
seven counties. You could run it. 
Ten hours a week just sitting be
hind a big desk watching your 
secretary get you coffee. Ill pay 
you $200,000 a year.
I scared myself. I actually con
sidered his offer for a second. Then 
I gave him my answer, Sorry, I 
have a good job that I dont want 
to leave.
We parted ways and now Im 
the only person who has won employee-of-the-month for seven 
straight months.

Protestors hunger for misguided attention
Michael T. Rose
Its interesting to me that Vince Eirene 
and his companions in front of Wean 
Hall have chosen fasting as their meta
phoric martyrdom. Although its em
ployment as a means of protest is a 
somewhat recent development in the 
history of fasting, it remains a respected 
and often effective means of emphasizing 
a point. While I admire Eirenes goals 
and his dedication to his cause, I am 
concerned about the philosophical justi
fications for fasting as protest in his 
situation.
For thousands of years, fasting has 
maintained a special role among human 
behaviors. In ritual observances, a fast 
has long been a necessary part of purifi
cation, absolution, and rite-of-passage 
ceremonies. The major religions all have 
fast days or periods; we are currently in 
the midst of the Islam holy month of 
Ramadan, when devout Muslims may 
not eat during daylight hours.
Fasting has often been considered a 
prerequisite for personal challenge or
gain. Candidate warriors  would-be 
knights or Native American boys on vi
sion quest  have traditionally fasted 
for a period before their initiation into 
adult society.
As a form of political or social protest, 
fasting  usually in the form of the ex
tended hunger strike  has been in
creasingly popular since the 1981 protest 
of Irish Republican Army prisoners that 
produced the term hunger strike and 
left 10 men dead. Hunger strikes in the 
80s have included an 11-day protest by 
the stepson of the late Soviet scientist 
Andrei Sahkarov and numerous mass 
hunger strikes in Asian countries, most 
notably a strike by students during the 
Tiananmen Square uprising. Oddly, from 
a quick scan of newspaper headlines it 
would seem that the hunger strike is a 
more acceptable form of protest in Asia 
than it is in the West, possibly due to 
societally fostered asceticism that is ab
sent in our gluttonous culture.
Most of these protests, however, have 
been agitations for large-scale social 
change; South African and Korean hun
ger strikers are aiming for at the very 
least the reconstruction of their societies. 
The current protest staged by Eirene is
In ritual observances, a fast has long been a necessary part of puri
fication, absolution, and rite-of-passage ceremonies.... Fasting has 
often been considered a prerequisite for personal challenge or gain.
an anti-war protest, specifically antiCamegie Mellons involvement in war. 
In intent his protest is similar to one 
staged in 1986 by Dr. Charles Hyder, a 
noted astronomer who promised to starve 
himself to death if the U.S. did not cease 
the production of nuclear weapons. More 
recently, an Army physician named 
David Wiggins fasted to protest his de
ployment to the Persian Gulf.
The problem I see with Eirenes ver
sion of starvation as protest is that 
individual suffering does not always bring 
attention to bear on the issues at hand. 
Hunger strikes are very effective when 
the issue is one of personal liberties or 
political influence; the institution being 
struck cannot afford to appear insensi
tive to the demands of the martyr. In this 
situation, however, Eirenes charges 
against CMU arent personal enough; he 
hasnt linked the concept of CMU re
search is killing people with the concept
of My friends and I will do without solid 
food for 30 days and suffer some discom
fort as a result.
Part of Eirenes problem in this area is 
that the research in question is quite 
impersonal. Technical issues of schedul
ing algorithms and threat assessment do 
not translate easily to dead Iraqi children 
and a bomb-ravaged country, and so far 
Eirene has been more effective at por
traying himself as a campus spectacle 
than he has been at elaborating the 
complex and deadly boring path that 
CMU-developed technology may make 
to combat. In addition, the absolutionistic 
aspect of fasting is missed here. What is 
he atoning for  the sins of SEI? No, he 
atones for nothing; he merely demon
strates his virtue that we might emulate 
his example, and that isnt enough.
In short, this protest  although 
imaginative  is not going to do much 
good. The campus community will con
tinue to look past the urgent moral ques
tions of a university on the killing ground 
and focus on three people growing 
gradually skinnier. That outcome is 
shame, but perhaps inevitable, until the 
presentation of the frightening facts is 
crafted with skill sufficient to match the 
showmanship of starvation.
On a personal level, the concept of a 
voluntary long-term fast is a bit troubling. 
In August of 1989,1 had surgery on my 
jaw that resulted in my mouth being 
wired shut for two months. Over that 
period, I was on a low-volume all-liquid 
diet; I lost almost 20 pounds. As a fellow 
hunger striker, I salute Eirene, Erin 
Bush, and Mike Glabicki; I know how 
difficult and unpleasant their experi
ence will be. I only wish it might be less 
in vain.

Richard Cohen
Virginia Governor L. Douglas 
Wilder is a fearless man. Hes 
running for president  hes au
thorized an exploratory commit
tee. He won the bronze star in 
Korea. Hes taken on Jesse Jack
son and has dared to demolish the 
stereotype of the black public of
ficial for whom spending pro
grams are a panacea.
Now, in suggesting mandatory 
drug testing of college students, 
Wilder has made his boldest move 
yet. Hes shown hes not afraid to 
be thoughtless.
For Wilder, a man of consider
able political talent and potential, 
his statement on drug testing 
represents a further drift to the 
right.
This time, though, he drifted
so far its hard to conclude that 
hes not a political opportunist. 
Already, he has reversed himself 
on the death penalty. A lifelong 
opponent, he switched his posi
tion in 1985 and in his first year 
as governor, authorized three ex
ecutions.
Wilder is one of those modernday political phenomena: The

instance  todays candidates 
declare first and then go out to 
build a following.
Nevertheless, Wilder has 
veered toward a place where a 
Democratic nominee should be: 
the middle of the road. That he 
has become increasingly less lib
eral over time should not be held 
against him.
A politician is entitled to change 
his mind and even pander a bit to 
the voters. After all, elected offi
cials would be neither elected nor
officials if they didnt usually do 
what the voters wanted.
And spending is the last thing 
the voters want  unless, of 
course, they personally are the 
beneficiaries.
But Wilder suggests that in 
seeking the White House, he will 
not be rushed by principle. He 
took a year to finally support the 
suit of a Virginia woman to be
admitted to the Virginia Military 
Institute, a much-beloved statesupported military school  
Stonewall Jackson taught there; 
George C. Marshall was an 
alumnus.
Its hard to equate all-male VMI 
with Virginias once-segregated 
school system, but the issue of 
gender segregation isnt all that 
different either.
Now Wilder has come out for 
drug testing of college students. 
His statement  since amended 
to random testing and growing 
increasingly vaguer as time goes 
on  followed a March 21 drug 
raid on three University of Vir

of their houses.

Commercialism threatens nations beliefs
'Javier Grillo-Marxuach
The announcement, construction, and 
I imminent completion of Euro-Disneyland 
I somewhere in the outskirts of Paris has 
caused something of an uproar  an 
understatement when one considers that 
the venture was referred to as a cultural
I Chernobyl by Frances minister of cul|ture.
The French, as a people, have a repu
tation  whether it has been earned or 
not is not the issue  for hatred of all 
things American. The remarks made by 
Frances minister of culture seem to reinforce that assessment. It is my per
sonal belief that the opening of a 
Disneyland  one in which one of the 
|fe\v tilings not advertised in English is, 
r obvious reasons, French Fries  in
the middle of France is not likely to 
destroy centuries of French culture, par
ticularly if the French are as staunch in 
defending their culture as many of the 
critics of the proposed Disneyland ap
pear to be.
The problem, however, is that, where 
many will probably attend EuroDisneyland, its existence will continue 
to provide ammunition for prejudice 
against America and Americans abroad. 
To mistake the beliefs of one corpora
tion, or the symbols of one amusement 
park, for the ideas of any group of people, 
is as asinine a fallacy as believing that 
the World Pavilions at EPCOT Center 
present the crafts, foods and customs of 
other countries as they truly are.
I say this because in criticizing EuroDisneyland as the destroyer of French 
and European culture, the projects de

subjectivity.
Euro-Disneyland will only become a 
cultural Chernobyl if the French allow 
themselves to be seduced by the ideolo
gies which so many of their critics decry 
as American self-delusion.
The presence of Euro-Disneyland will 
create a greater access to American con
sumerism  a label which I am loath to 
apply  but if this is all it takes to 
destroy the culture of the French, will 
the fault lie solely in the presence of 
Euro-Disneyland? Are human beings so 
intellectually defenseless that the exist
ence of an amusement park is liable to 
cause an end to the beliefs of a nations 
individuals, and, if this is the case, what 
does that say about the soundness of 
those beliefs in the first place?
The purpose of this writing is not to 
give the French a lesson in how to take 
pride in their nation  they have done 
well enough on their ownbut to apply 
the French example to the United States, 
a nation which harbors as many preju
dices against the encroachment of the 
ways of another into its own culture as do 
the French.
At the same time as the French began 
to cry foul at the building of EuroDisneyland, the American media was 
having a field day over what was referred 
to in news magazine shorthand as the 
buying of America  a phenomenon 
which was most often summed up by 
stand-up comics under the complaint 
that its no wonder the Japanese are 
buying our buildings.

our nation to be in danger, instead of 
looking to our own systems and beliefs as

President even appeared on tape 
during the telecast of the NCAA 
basketball championship, talking 
about Desert Storm. He cant stop 
talking about it!
Cuomo says, facetiously but 
acidly, that some politician soon 
will wear epaulets and a saber. 
There will be a saber in the cam
paign. But, he adds, Democrats 
are not really vulnerable to the 
brandishing of military symbols. 
Is, he asks, the crucial criterion a 
willingness to wage war? Fine. 
Democrats were good at that. 
Roosevelt was no shirker. Truman 
dropped the bomb..
But were, was, and dropped

that defies disguising  not that 
he shows the slightest inclination 
to disguise it  is that the war 
tapped a dark atavism in America.

We are "good at killing," even, he intimates, comfortable 
with killing. When the President turns his attention to 
the domestic agenda, what leads the list? A bill featuring 
expanded uses of the death penalty.
Presidents should be easy. An 
administration that can find half a 
trillion dollars for the S&L cleanup 
but cant find relative pocket 
change for fighting drugs ...
But before you can change the 
nations mind, you must change 
the topic of conversation. Arid 
Cuomo, like many other Demo
crats, may find that hard. Oppo
sition to the use of force in the 
Persian Gulf in January is intel
lectually defensible, but the po
litical chore of making that de
fense may be incompatible with 
the need to conduct a forwardfocused presidential campaign.
Cuomo disagrees. He is in his 
third term and ninth year as gov
ernor and knows how long 18 
months can be in politics. While 
he was speaking last week about 
epaulets and war, the farce in 
Kuwaitthe emir thinking about

steps toward democracy, sort of, 
soon, or sometime, God willing 
 was counterpoint to the trag
edy unfolding in Iraq.
On the graph of national seren
ity, two lines may be about to 
cross. One is the descending line 
tracing the diminishing emotional 
returns from the victory celebra
tions.
The other line traces the rising 
revulsion about the chaos, dis
ease, starvation, and death that
. is not really surprising, even in 
the aftermath of a war waged to 
enhance peace and stability.
To the rest of the country, the 
condition of Cuomos realm, New 
York state, is indistinguishable 
from the condition of New York 
City, which is so far down at the 
heels it can hardly aspire to 
seediness. Were Cuomo to be a 
candidate, his problem would not 
be that there is a Willie Horton 
a richly symbolic embarrassment 
 in his record. Rather, his prob
lem would be that New York City 
is a Willie Horton: scary.
The condition of most states is, if 
not scary, depressing. There has 
been, he says, a double redistribu
tion of burdens and wealth. Tax 
cuts benefiting the affluent have, 
he says, coincided with cuts in 
federal support for social programs. 
These cuts now coincide with a 
recession, and this forces states 
into increased reliance on regres
sive sales and property taxes.
Recalling that in his first state-ofthe-state message less than a decade 
ago he did not need to deal with AIDS 
or the homeless, he says, We must 
share out wealth in ways we have 
been reluctant to do.
All this is at least arguable. But 
before it can be argued, the coun
try must change the course of its 
current conversation. Is Cuomo 
fluent enough to do that? Probably 
not. But on the 500th anniversary 
of Columbus voyage, he might 
enjoy being the first ItalianAmerican to contest for the job of 
setting the nations public agenda.

Carnival and alcohol should mix responsibl
Rich Robinson
As can be seen by the construction 
around campus, Spring CarAival is this 
week. Carnival has always been a time 
to let go and get wild without the stress 
that you have a test or a problem set due 
the next day. But with all the partying 
comes some responsibility.
There is always a lot of drinking going 
on during Carnival. Now, there is noth
ing wrong with this. But everyone has to 
remember that there are alumni here 
and other students who want to have a 
good time as well.
This is where the responsibility comes 
in. Running across the Midway drunk 
and causing problems is just going to 
detract from the idea of Carnival. Its a
nuisance to the people you bother and it 
takes away from the care-free atmo
sphere of Carnival.
There has been talk all semester about 
alcohol and how many students are over
drinking and then causing problems.
During this coming weekend, there 
exists the potential for many drinking 
related problems to become more serious. 
But it is up to you, the drinker, to make 
sure that there are no problems.
The people in authority, not only at 
this university, but in the country, believe 
that we, as young adults, are not respon
sible enough to drink. This is clearly 
illustrated by the 21-year-old drinking 
age.
Prove this weekend that you, as a re
sponsible young adult, can handle drink
ing in a responsible manner.
There are a few simple things that you 
have to do. They are all easy enough to
During this coming weekendthere exists the 
potential for many drinking related problems 
to become more serious. But it is up to you, 
the drinker, to make sure that there are no 
problems.
follow. First, stay alert. Protect those 
people who are not acting responsibly by 
preventing them from driving, getting in 
fights, or drinking more than they need 
to.
Second, dont drive drunk yourself. A 
friend of mine just had a car accident this 
past weekend because he was drinking. 
He drove off a 12 foot cliff and just missed 
landing in a river.
Not only might you hurt yourself, but
most likely you will hurt some innocent 
person crossing the street or driving on 
the same road.
Next, dont drink until you pass out. 
Moderate your drinking. You can have a 
great time if you arent falling down 
drunk.
In addition, youll be able to remember 
what happened the next day. And you 
probably wont do anything stupid that 
youll regret.
Finally, dont harass other people 
When you are drunk, some people ten 
to get kicks out of harassing people the 
dont know. It usually ends in a fight 
some other stupid confrontation.
You dont need to annoy other people tj 
have fun during Carnival. There aj 
enough enjoyable things going on th; 
youll be entertained on the Midwa 
watching a band play, or hanging out wit 
your friends.
I know that many people intend t( 
drink this weekend. There is no doulj 
about that. But I intend to make sur 
that none of my friends hurt themselve 
or cause any problems. I remember m 
past two Carnivals, and they are gre^ 
memories. Lets all make sure it staj 
that way.

Cultural mythology promotes acts of sexual assault
'A
OIngrid Bromberg and 
Justine Dymond
Most rapes committed on col
lege campuses are acquaintance 
rapes. One woman in four is raped 
during her college career. The 
difference between stranger rape 
and acquaintance rape is that the 
victim is raped by someone [s]he 
knows. Confusion among college 
students about what acquain
tance rape is and sometimes a 
lack of understanding or clear 
communication between students 
regarding sex contribute to the 
high percentage of rapes on cam
pus.
The first step to stopping ac
quaintance rape is to recognize 
when you are being forced, or 
forcing someone else, through 
intimidation or threat of violence, 
into doing something against your 
wish or someone elses. Women 
will resist or say no when they do 
not want to have sex orbe touched. 
When she says no, a woman means 
no. It is a misconception that a 
woman does not really mean no,
or a woman is just saying no to be 
coy. A more prevalent myth is 
that her no is translatable: no 
really means yes. No means that 
she just needs to be persuaded a 
little harder. Or the phrase re
cently seen on t-shirts made at 
CMU: No means she needs an
other beer.
All of these myths stem from 
the patriarchal illusions that a 
woman does not know what she 
wants, can not make up her mind 
on her own, or needs to be shown 
and convinced of what is pleasur
able.
Our society teaches us that 
women are dominated by emo
tion and are not capable of being 
logical; therefore, they can not be 
trusted with decision making. 
However, in reality, women can 
and do make decisions for and 
about themselves. So, how do we 
learn to believe myths?
Through the media, individuals 
in our society are taught to play 
out certain roles. When we were 
children, our parents read us fairy 
tales in which women were being 
saved by handsome princes; as 
adults we see the same theme on 
TV, in the movies, and in books 
we read. There are numerous 
examples in the media that teach
When she says no, a woman means no. It is a miscon
ception that a woman does not really mean no, or a 
woman is just saying no to be coy.
men and women to act and think 
in ways that lead to rape.
One example is in Milan 
Kunderas novel The Unbearable 
Lightness of Being. Not until 
Tomas reached her groin did she 
start resisting. He could not quite 
guess how seriously she meant 
it. Tomas doubts the womans 
decision by thinking that maybe 
she really wants to go further.
If the woman really did want to 
continue, she would not have re
sisted in the first place. Women 
know what they want just as men 
know what they want. And both 
sexes have a right to decide what 
they want to do with their own 
bodies.
Films perpetuate the belief that 
women like to be forced into 
having sex. We are all familiar 
with the film scene where the 
woman resists a mans kiss, then 
gives in and kisses him. The film 
Bird on a Wire is a good example. 
The female protagonist is ex
tremely upset with the male 
character for the first half of the 
film and then he kisses her and 
they start to make love. These 
types of scenes can be traced back 
to early movies such as Gone with 
the Wind in which Scarlett 
screams, No, no, no! as Rhett 
carries her up the stairs. In this 
scene there is no sign that Scarlett 
eventually gives in. The implied 
message is that because they are 
married, Rhett has the right to 
force Scarlett to have sex against 
her will.
These representations of male/ 
female relationships in films give 
us the perception that these sorts 
of relations are natural and should 
happen. In reality, forcing any 
kind of sexual contact is consid
ered sexual assault and is pun
ishable by law.
Another misconception of how 
people should relate to each other 
sexually is the idea of sex as a 
bargain. The line of thinking goes:
If I buy this woman a drink then 
she has to have sex with me. If I 
pay for this womans movie then 
she owes me sex. If a woman 
invites me into her dorm room 
then she is saying that she wants 
to sleep with me or if a woman 
dates me for a period of time she 
should have sex with me.
Page 39 of the novel Original 
Sin by Lisa Alther depicts a scene 
where a teen-age girl is being 
intimidated into sex by her steady 
boyfriend, she says: I want to 
hold you and kiss you. I want us to 
talk about what we did today. I 
just dont want all that other 
stuff. Well, holding and kissing 
may be what you want, but it aint 
enough for me...You get me all 
worked up, and then you get of
fended if I try to do anything about 
it.
The bargain involved in this 
scene is sex for time. Assuming 
that sex is an exchangeable com
modity is a dangerous assumption
to live by. Later in the novelj 
Original Sin the boyfriend rapi 
his girlfriend. Bodies can not b! 
bought or sold for a drink or a 
movie.
Examples of the roles that mej 
and women are supposed to ai 
out in real life are thrown at us 
constantly. Both men and women 
feel the pressure to fulfill thej 
roles.
In order to stop acquaintam 
rape, men and women need to] 
work to break down the stereo 
typed roles fed to us and reii 
forced by the media.
The Deans office at Dartmoutl 
College is telling students thi 
they should not have sex withoi 
a clearly stated yes from bot 
partners.
In order for this to work, wome 
have to learn to make it clear 
their partner that they want 
have sex.
And men must learn to respe 
whatever is said. Also, if student 
today spoke more freely an 
openly to one another about s( 
many campus acquaintance rap( 
would not occur.

Culture opposes business

a possible source of the need for an easy 
scapegoat, and instead of looking at the 
possible advantages of foreign invest
ment in the United States, many of the 
voices which were heard in the wake of 
such events as the purchase of the 
Rockefeller Center heaved cries such as 
This is an economic Pearl Harbor!
The Japanese are not the largest for
eign investors in the United States, but 
they are an easy target.
Their culture, as American culture 
may be to the French, is suitably alien 
unlike England to the United States, 
their economic status is one of leader
ship and their position is one of action. 
Seeing an invasion in the fact that 
other nations are taking opportunities 
which we have been unable to exploit is 
an evasion which leads to easy preju
dices and lost opportunities for under
standing and co-operation.
Ultimately, if we expect the world to
become cross-culturally aware, we have 
to be able to accept the fact that every 
link of cross-cultural communication 
which has and will be established is not 
necessarily going to be to our liking, and 
that this does not incapacitate our ca
pacity for self-analysis and self-im
provement, or for mutual understand
ing between different cultures.
The political, technological, and eco
nomic elements which have allowed 
the construction of Euro-Disneyland, 
and the purchase of American land by 
Japanese investors have also made 
the decision of whether to summarily 
dismiss another culture, attempt to 
understand it, or to compete, or coop
erate, within our means, all the more 
important.
In this case, the easiest solution 
may not be the best one.

Letters to the Editor
LETTERS, from page 10
the dominance of any group.
The two more fundamental forces fuel
ing Hannans excessively angry letter 
seem to be homophobia  hatred of les
bians and gay men  and a need to 
describe feminists as weak and some
how unable to act in a male-dominated
 Hannans words  world. When she 
describes participants in the Womens 
Center as a bunch of insecure lesbian 
feminists, she rides on the assumption 
that all three words are epithets, reveal
ing her own homophobia and her  mis
taken  belief that her audience shares 
it. Obviously, too, men and people of 
many different sexual orientations par
ticipate in the Womens Center. If it 
were, however, a group of insecure les
bian feminists, Hannans phrase would 
still fail as an insult. Many people would 
consider lesbian, feminist, or both a
compliment, and, as Ill show, insecure 
is misplaced here.
Hannan apparently has something at 
stake in an image of women as capable of 
acting effectively within a male-dominated social world: I do believe that 
women are just as capable as men at 
succeeding. She holds herself up as an 
example: if I feel that perhaps they 
(men) are playing unfair or are acting as 
if Im not capable, then that only fuels 
my desire to prove them wrong by work
ing even harder.
As many feminists will agree, women 
have, in fact, responded to male-domi
nated systems by working extremely 
hard, and they have often succeeded as
tonishingly well. If this is so, why are 
women in the U.S., as a group, paid 
significantly less than men for compa
rable work? Why are there so many fewer 
women than men faculty at Carnegie
Mellon, most strikingly in high-paid 
technical and scientific areas? Clearly, 
as Hannan seems to agree, the system 
acts  sometimes quite subtly  to 
check womens success within it. And, as 
she suggests, some women struggle 
successfully against such checks.
Hannans anger seems directed at 
women who work collectively  as part 
of a group like the Womens Center  
rather than as isolated individuals, and 
at people who discuss the systematic 
problems they face rather than with
holding criticism and acting within the 
social world as it is. Perhaps she per
ceives them as a threat to her image of 
women as capable of struggling within a 
system as individuals. Perhaps she per
ceives them as a threat to herself as 
someone engaged in such a struggle; 
their actions, as she mistakenly under
stands them, may imply to her that
women are not capable of succeeding on 
their own.
She obviously feels a need  lacking 
evidence or any reference to reality  to 
diminish them as people who, to her, 
must somehow have failed within the 
existing system. However, to character
ize such people  who work collectively 
and who criticize aspects of the existing 
social world  as weak or insecure is a 
cop-out, when the insecurity is hers. As 
Hannans hostile response to the 
Womens Center attests, criticizing the 
status quo entails risk; to take such a 
risk is a sign of strength rather than of 
weakness or cowardice. Working collec
tively rather than individually both re
quires and produces strength, not weak
ness.
By discussing Hannans letter in this 
way, I do not wish to elevate her letter to 
the status of an argument. It constitutes
a much more striking an example of b! 
mouthing, mud slinging, ranting, aij 
raving than any example of discoufl 
produced by the Womens Center. I al 
do not claim to speak for the Womer 
Center. I have been to the Womens Ce

Mens lacrosse splits two games
PRESS PASS
by Jason McDonald
Coffey weakens 
Pens chances
After a great season during 
which they won the first divi
sion title in team history, the 
Pittsburgh Penguins stand a 
chance of being eliminated by 
the lowly fourth-place New 
Jersey Devils. A loss during 
tonights game at the Civic 
Arena would hardly be the 
worlds greatest upset. In fact, 
the Pens chances are pretty 
good since defenseman Paul 
Coffey is out of action.
The fact of the matter is that 
the absence of Coffey only 
makes the Pens more prepared 
to battle a team that plays the 
type of hockey that the Devils 
play. In fact, Ive been in agony 
over the mismatch between 
Coffey and the Pens ever since 
"he came from Edmonton.
"'""As well as he skates, passes,
 and handles the puck, Coffey is 
equally poor in his own end of 
the rink. Yet, for some odd 
reason, no one seems willing to 
acknowledge this fact.
Ever seen Coffey run someone 
against the boards? I havent, 
and Ive seen a lot of Penguin 
games. How about Coffey 
stopping an opposing forward at 
the blue line? You must be 
kidding. After all, Paul might 
break a nail.
Part of the problem lies on the 
ice. As much as I love the Pens, 
the current Penguin defensive 
corps cant cover for Coffey as 
well as the Oiler defensemen 
could during Coffeys days in 
Edmonton. In addition, the 
Oiler forwards were much more 
capable of picking up the slack 
, that Coffey creates.
The greater mistake lies in 
the Penguin front office. The 
Pens brass, from Eddie 
DeBartolo on down, had either 
no clue as to what the job of a 
defenseman entailed, or more 
likely, they just didnt care.
They went out and got Coffey 
to promote ticket sales, which 
worked flawlessly. They even 
got the cute Double Trouble 
theme going with Coffey (77') 
and Mario Lemieux (66) leading 
the way. The fans did come to 
games, so it was a success at 
.. the box office.
But the first five games of this 
lears playoffs proved that the 
"friove was a disaster on the ice. 
Every time Coffey laid back on 
defense, the rest of the Pens 
defense and the forwards had to 
overplay to cover the gaps. The 
Devils capitalized on a few 
Coffey mistakes, and more 
importantly, the overworked 
Pens were too worn down to 
challenge the Devils stifling 
defense.
To their credit, the Pens 
havent had a whole lot of help 
from the officials. New Jersey 
has been getting away with a 
lot of extracurricular stick work. 
Referee Ron Schicks perfor
mance in Game Two should be 
sent to the league office with a 
demand for his resignation.
The Devils deserve some of 
the credit as well. They check a 
lot more and a lot harder than 
the Pens, and New Jersey goalie 
Chris Tererri has had a truly 
Magnificent series.
Unfortunately, the biggest 
Problem was Paul Coffey, who is 
so clearly out of place in head 
coach Bob Johnsons style of 
hockey. In a physical, teamoriented game like hockey, you 
need all five people on the ice 
forking together, not four and 
one guy whos checking his hair

The Carnegie Mellon mens la
crosse club suffered an important 
loss against the University of 
Pittsburgh yesterday, falling by a 
final score of 8-5. However, they 
blew away West Virginia, 149, 
on Saturday. Even with the home 
field advantage and bad weather, 
West Virginia could not hold 
CMU.
It was an utter mudbath with 
a ton of mud and three to four 
inches of water on the field, said 
senior Phil Kaplan.
Although the referees agreed 
that the field was unfit to play, 
they ruled to let the game go on.
We didnt want to play in the 
horrible weather, but West Vir
ginia insisted, said senior goal 
tender Peter Vonderlieth.
Since West Virginia wanted to 
play, CMU decided to give it its 
best. In the goal tally, senior cap
tain Rob Kendall scored five, 
graduate student Bayard John
son scored four, junior Todd 
Bredbenner scored two, freshman 
Rick Keiser scored two, and se
nior John Seekings scored one.
Carnegie Mellon fell behind 3- 
1 in the first quarter as the CMU 
players not only had to fight the 
mud but also what they believed 
were biased referees.
Even the coach had believed 
that the referees were biased for 
West Virginia and against us. We 
continually had to fight the refs, 
said Kaplan.
However, CMU took the lead in 
the middle of the second quarter,

4-3. Unfortunately, WVU came 
back and tied it 4-4 ending the 
first half.
[Sophomore] midfielder Joe 
Hyndts got a lot of ground balls 
and made key hits against the 
other players to get them into the 
mud, which looks good for us, 
said Kaplan.
Carnegie Mellon turned up the 
heat in the second half and scored 
a total of 10 goals, while West 
Virginia was only able to score 
five times. CMU was able to do 
this because it decided to stop 
fightingthe referees. In addition, 
Bredbenner scored a goal in the 
third quarter while CMU was 
shorthanded due to a threeminute penalty. During that pen
alty, West Virginia was not able 
to score a single goal.
The play of Vonderlieth, who 
made 15 saves, was also a key to 
the victory. It was hard to make 
many saves because of the very 
sticky and slippery mud, he said. 
The team persevered through the 
horrible weather. We came out 
and gave them a real good game.
The key player was [senior] 
defenseman Hudson Tiffany who 
we call Mudson, because he plays 
so well in the mud, said Kaplan. 
He really helped us out before 
when we played Slippery Rock in 
the mud.
Senior Joe Hyndts fires a pass to senior Rob Kendall who proceeds to
With the win over West Vir
ginia, CMU reached a record of 6-
0 in the regular season. The un
beaten first-place Carnegie Mel
lon lacrosse club then lost to the 
second ranked University of Pitts
burgh team yesterday at 1:30 pm 
in the Gesling Stadium at CMU.
They got on top of us really 
quickly, said Vonderlieth.
Pitt scored four goals in the 
first quarter to lead CMU 41. 
Carnegie Mellon struggled to try 
to tie the game, but Pitt contin
ued to hold the lead 6-2 in the 
second quarter. The CMU play
ers had a hard time due to 14 
penalties against them.
Vonderlieth said, We killed 
ourselves with penalties.
The Carnegie Mellon Lacrosse 
club could not keep up with Pitt 
even in the second half. Pittscored 
another two goals in the third 
while CMU only got one. Carn
egie Mellon was able to hold Pitt 
from scoring in the fourth quar
ter, but they could not overtake

them.
Three goals for CMU were 
scored by Johnson, one scored by 
Seekings, and one scored by 
Keiser. CMU go altender Vonder
lieth had 28 saves.
Both goalies had very good 
games, said Vonderlieth.
Carnegie Mellons loss to Pitt 
makes them tied in the division. 
Fortunately, yesterdays game 
was the last one in the regular 
season for Pitt, but CMU has sev
eral more games ahead.

The Carnegie Mellon baseball 
club had a good week on the field, 
splitting a pair of games, but poor 
weather ruined the clubs week
end home stand.
In its most recent game, Carn
egie Mellon lost a 4-0 decision at 
St. Vincent College. Head coach 
Neil Stoernell was pleased with 
his teams performance, despite 
the final score.
We just werent able to get that 
clutch hit, said Stoernell. We 
had runners on base, but we just 
couldnt get them in. We were 
getting on him [the St. Vincent 
pitcher] pretty well, but we just 
never got him.
Stoernell was also pleased with 
the pitching performance of jun
ior Mike Gess. Mike pitched a 
wonderful game for us, said 
Stoernell. St. Vincent got three 
runs in the first and one in the 
second, but that was the end of 
their scoring.
Gess pitched all eight innings 
for Carnegie Mellon. He yielded 
only six hits while striking out 11 
St. Vincent batters.

Schmiedl and senior Matt 
Pampena led the Tartans on the 
mound while Schmiedl, sopho
more Joey Mauro, and Gess led 
the Carnegie Mellon offense.
Carnegie Mellon had weekend 
home games scheduled against 
Butler Community College and 
Penn State-New Kensington, but 
those games were cancelled due 
to rain. Stoernell expects todays 
game against Allegheny Commu
nity College-South to be post
poned as well. With the rain this 
weekend, our field is in bad shape 
even if it doesnt rain [today], he 
said.
The weekends postponed 
games have yet to be resched
uled. In other action this week, 
the club will travel to Penn StateBeaver Campus tomorrow before 
a Thursday home doubleheader 
against Pitt-Greensburg.
CMU track hosts first meet at Gesling
By ALIM RAY
Tartan Sports Editor
Carnegie Mellons track teams 
showed great improvement at 
Saturdays eight-hour invita
tional held at CMU a week before 
the University Athletic Associa
tion Championships.
Approximately 20 teams at
tended the meet, including tough 
teams from all divisions such as 
University of Pittsburgh, 
Frostburg University, and West 
Virginia University.
The invitational was supposed 
to be held at Clarion University of 
Pennsylvania but do to schedule 
problems the meet was held at 
Carnegie Mellon.
Mens head track coach Gary 
Meckley was impressed with his 
teams performance this weekend 
when compared to its performance 
last weekend, at the Indiana Uni
versity of Pennsylvania Invita
tional. The Carnegie Mellon 
placed better this weekend than 
they did last week against the 
same teams.
Meckley was worried at the be
gin of the season because his team 
was not in the shape they should 
have been and had many injuries. 
Now at one of the last tune ups 
before the Univeristy Athletic As
sociation Championships the 
team has shown excellent im
provement.
The first place finishers for Carnegie Mellons mens team in
cluded sophomore Brad Shapiro 
in the 1500-meter run with a time 
of 4:07.8, senior Tim Berger in the 
5000-meter run with a time of 
15:36.6, and the 4x400-meter re
lay consisting of Shapiro, senior 
Jeff Illian, junior Bill Isaacs, and 
sophomore Sean Pempel with a 
time of 3:26.2.
Some other good performances 
for Carnegie Mellon were 
Pempels second-place finish in 
the 400-meter hurdles, fifth-year 
senior Gary Harrisons secondplace finish in the 800 meter run,

games to establish a strong start
to the 1991 season. Pitcher John 
Smiley hinted that he might be

New Dodger center fielder Brett

The Cincinnati Reds, who

struck out collectively 635 times

Strong pitching and explosive

California and Kansas City,

Much of the success for the Tartans

NHL playoffs pull big surprises with upsets
The Pittsburgh Penguins forced 
a seventh game in their playoff 
series with the New Jersey Devils 
Saturday night by beating the 
Devils, 43. The Penguins vic
tory came over a disputed call by 
referee Bill McCreary. In the 
third period, Devils center Laurie 
Boschman scored a goal which 
McCreary claimed he kicked into 
the net. However, the replays on 
television clearly showed that the 
puck hit Boschmans stick before 
entering the net and the goal 
should have counted. Unfortu
nately for the New Jersey Devils, 
there is no replay official in the

NHL. Game seven will be held 
tonight in Pittsburgh at 7:30 pm 
in the Civic Arena. This one is too 
close to call.
The Washington Capitals sent
the New York Hangers packing 
Saturday with a 42 victory. The 
Caps won the playoff series by the 
same tally. For some reason, the 
Rangers just cannot play well in 
post-season action. Out of 11 the 
NHL teams, the Rangers are prob
ably hurt more by overconfidence 
than anything else. The Capitals 
will meet the winner of the Pitts
burgh-New Jersey Series on Fri
day for the division champion
ship playoff.
The Adams Division is now a 
contest between the Montreal 
Canadiens and the Boston Bru
ins. This really isnt a surprise,
considering the same matchup 
has taken place for the past three 
years. Both teams favor defenseoriented, tight-checking-style 
games. This is going to be a very 
tough series for both teams and 
will probably take all seven games 
to decide the winner. Its almost 
too close to call, but I think the 
Canadiens will come out on top 
this season.
In the Norris Divison, two teams 
are poised to win great upsets. 
The Minnesota North Stars lead 
the Chicago Blackhawks, and the 
Detroit Red Wings lead the St. 
Louis Blues, both by a tally of
-three games to two. St. Louis and 
Chicago were expected to breeze 
through the first rotund but both 
have Seen shocked by the inspired 
play df the underdogs. Game 6 in 
both series was last night and 
scores were not available by press 
time. i
The Los Angeles Kings and the 
Edmonton Oilers are both on itop 
of their respective playoff series 
in the Smythe Division. For a 
brief time, it looked as if the 
Vancouver Canucks might stun 
the hockey world by bringing 
down Wayne Gretzky and the 
Kings, but the Kings play has
solidified and they should win 
easily.1 ('
The Oilers/Calgary Flames con
test was perhaps the most evenly 
matched of the playoffs. 
Edmonton.is up 3-2 but this one 
will probably still take seven 
games to decide. I think 
Edmonton will come out on top, 
setting up another chance for 
Gretzfcys Kins to unseat the 
reignm^ Stanley Cup champions 
in the division playoffs.

Pitt smites Carnegie Mellon rugby club in mud
By DAVE MARTIN
Tartan Staffwriter
On a rainy Saturday afternoon 
CMUs rugby club took on the 
University of Pittsburgh in muddy 
Frick Park.
Short on starters in less than 
excellent playing conditions, the 
Eggmen fell to the Panthers, 16-
4.
Pittsburgh scored early in the 
first half with a try, but couldnt 
convert the kick after, taking a 4-
i nema+ m.neia+/ lahian edmpi hnpipgi.iijiidi
Senior wing forward Charlie Jarkowski tackles Pitts scrum half.
0 lead. A lack of solid tackling 
allowed Pittsburgh to score some 
time later, converting the kick 
this time, and lifted the score to 
10-0. Near the end of the first 
half, freshman Bill Lucier scored 
a try to tighten the gap 10-4.
The second half went Pitts way 
as well, as the Carnegie Mellon 
scrum was ineffective against 
Universiy of Pittsburghs divisionone-tested scrum. The Pitt Pan
thers managed to score one try 
and kick after, resulting in the 
final score.
Senior flyback Joe Schwerha 
said, It was a tough game, hard 
fought, but we dont play well in 
rain and mud. And we were over
powered in the scrum for the first 
time this season.
Senior John Lima commented, 
It was a sloppy game. We didnt 
tackle well. But if it hadnt been 
for [seniors] Charlie Jankowski 
and Peter Lowe, we couldve been 
beaten 300-4. We really missed 
starting [senior] prop Ed Miller, 
[senior] Steve Pearlmutter came 
in and playedpretty well, though.

Booths promise fun
Josh Freeman/Tartan Photo Staff Manager
Ivan Schneider works on Delta Upsilons booth, Swiss Family Robinson Saturday. Not even rain can keep 
these serious competitors from putting the final touches on their dreams of a number one booth.
By KATIE CULBERTSON
Tartan Editor-in-Chief
The hammering and sawing on 
the fraternity quad, over by the 
sororities, and at independent 
organizations home bases pick 
up a frantic pace this week as 
groups scramble to put the finish
ing touches on their booths for 
Spring Carnival.
This years theme, From Cover 
to Cover, promises to provide stu
dents, faculty, alumni, and par
ents with a very literary experi
ence as they tour the midway. 
From Sherlock Holmes to The 
Wizard of Oz to Treasure Is
land, Carnival-goers can look 
forward to mystery, adventure, 
and magic. Turning the pages 
through this years midway map 
promises some fun at every stop.
Last year in the fraternity cat
egory, Phi Kappa Theta finished 
first, followed by Delta Upsilon 
and Sigma Alpha Epsilon.
For a taste of the Far East, stop 
off at Phi Kaps Shogun. Last 
years overall booth competitors 
are looking forward to a change of 
pace  one with a cultural flair. 
Its something different, said co
chair Michael Mo, a junior chemi
cal engineer. Last year, Phi Kap 
built Sutters Mill.
We want, of course, to be com
petitive and at the same time do 
something we can be proud of,, 
said co-chair and junior IM major
Don Good. The booth will be an 
18th century Japanese house, 
complete with authentic lighting 
and furnishings, said Good.
DU brings out a more adven
turous side this year with The 
Swiss Family Robinson. Last 
year, DU garnered second with 
The Flinstones at Bedrock. This 
year, the brothers and pledges 
take a much more rustic approach.
Were in it to have fun, and to 
get the brotherhood together says 
co-chair Craig Clapper, a junior 
history major. Clapper, although 
he admits the competition will be 
tough, thinks his house has a good 
chance of doing just as well or 
even better than last year.
SAE will investigate a possible 
top-three finish in the fraternity 
division with Sherlock Holmes. 
Last year, SAE took a surprise 
third place with The Lost City of 
Atlantis.
Once again, surprise is the name 
of the game. Its going to be a 
booth full of surprises, said sopho
more drama production major and 
co-chair Aaron Skalka. Although 
anticipating tough competition, 
Skalka said the house is confi
dent of placing in the top three.
Eleven other houses besides last 
years top three finishers are vy
ing for a trophy this year also. 
Sitting in the northwest corner of 
the midway this year are the 
brothers and pledges of Kappa 
Delta Rho, who chose a Disney
courtesy Spring CaflPIT Committee
 literally
theme with Snow White. Right 
next door, AlphaTau Omega plans 
the Stephen King horror novel 
Pet Semetary.
Continuing around the midway 
are the brothers and pledges of 
Sigma Nu, as they go 20,000 
Leagues Under the Sea. Next 
door, ThetaXi plans a trip through 
fantasyland with The Wizard of 
Oz.
Rounding out the first row of 
booths on the midway, Delta Tau 
Delta is planning Where theWild 
Things Are. DTD won the booth 
competition - two years ago, but 
finished fourth last year with their 
Chicago Speakeasy.
This year, the DTD brothers 
are less concerned about competi
tion and looking more forward to 
the fun. We want to make it a lot 
of fun, said senior IM major and 
co-chair Dan Bergad. If we win a 
trophy, itll be really cool, but we 
just want to have a lot of fun. 
Also in the fraternity division, 
Beta Theta Pi will present Drag
ons; Alpha Epsilon Pi is plan
ning Peanuts. Also on the mid
way are Pi Kappa Alpha with 
Dark Knight and Sigma Tau 
Gamma with the Spanish classic 
Don Quixote. Rounding out the 
fraternities are Pi Lambda Phi 
tfith Dune and Kappa Sigma 
with Life in Hell.

ompubookie announces 1991 buggy predictions
ATO new dark horse contender,  Pikas reign loosens
Editors note: Compubookie is the myserious troll who, according to legend, 
zsides beneath Panther Hollow Bridge 
watches buggies roll through the 
>hute. Not even The Tartan knows 
'ompubookies true identity. Every year, 
'ompubookie shares predictions ofSweepfakes; here are this years picks:
With Spirits three-year domination 
nded in 1990 by Pika, Sweepstakes 1991 
hould be even more interesting than 
iVer. Pika pushed its way to its first 
Nens title since 1986 and swept all three 
Ji ' isions. The question that provides the 
frama for 1991 is: will Pika be able to 
tyy on top and fend off the many chal
lengers?
The loss of their core of three senior 
Ushers will make repeating a chancy bet 
or Pika. They have put out two new 
)uggies this year, much the same as last
 As of late, they have not been run|*lng last years mens championship 
luggy, Vengeance. Spirits push team 
vill be as strong as ever. With the added 
esire to get its title back, Spirit has to be 
regarded as the favorite on race day. Beta 
11 also be right there, with a very small 
w buggy, an exceptional push team 
tod some very fast freeroll times. Sigma 
while continuing to improve its bugwith better and better technology, 
:eems only to be lacking the athletes to 
lut them over the top.
% prediction for the most improved 
?rganization goes to ATO. A good effort
i roin the house should quickly make them 
Contenders.
New buggies from Kappa Sig, SDC,
Sweepstakes 1991 
should be even more 
interesting than ever 
the ques tion is: will Pika 
be able to stay on top 
and fend off the chal
lengers?______________
ATO, Pika, Pioneers, KDR, SAE, Beta, 
and DU leaves one wondering what Sigma 
Nu, CIA, DTD, and Theta Xi are doing to 
insure their performance when the gun 
goes off. Whatever they are doing will 
provide no small thrill on race day.
The womens races will once again pro
vide an increasingly high amount of com
petition. Pika and Spirit have flip-flopped 
records over the past few years and, along 
with Theta Xi, are once again favorites. 
Pika has lost some of its potential push
ers to Theta Xi, which, on the other hand, 
is not short on pushers at all. They are 
even rumored to be fielding a C team this 
year. With this much talent, they should 
emerge victorious.
The rain problems that plagued last 
years freerolls and Race Day were no
where to be found, with a majority of the 
spring freerolls being held as scheduled. 
One can only hope that this weather 
continues for Carnival. So set your alarm, 
grab a spot on the hill and watch the 
action in the Chute, which promises to be 
exciting.

New rivalries, old champs vying for Sweepstakes glory
Spring Carnival Preview
By JENNIFER FORBES
Tartan Production Manager
& JONATHAN LEVY
Tartan Contributing Editor
The biggest question mark of 
Sweepstakes 1991 going into the 
final weekend b.efore Carnival was 
how many teams would be unable 
to qualify because of bad weather. 
Both days proved to be disap
pointing to organizations hoping 
to get in last-minute rolls. Sun
day, however, a few buggies rolled.
Sweepstakes Chair Ray Frattos 
predictions for the race results 
will probably surprise few. He 
picks Beta Theta Pi first, Spirit 
second, and Pi Kappa Alpha third 
in the mens races. In the womens 
competition, he sees Pika and 
Spirit taking the first and second 
places respectively.
'Commenting on other organi
zations, he said Phi Kap, I think, 
would be a good team if they had 
an excellent push team. He also 
predicted that Delta Upsilon and 
Delta Tau Delta would do better 
than expected.
Fratto said that his most im
portant goal this year is to have a 
safe Sweepstakes. Showing signs 
of strain as Race Day approached, 
he said Ill be glad when its over. 
Im really stressed out, really 
tired.
Eighteen organizations will 
compete in Sweepstakes 1991. 
They are previewed below in the 
order of their best mens finishes 
in 1990.
Pi Kappa Alpha
Changes: We do have some 
promising pushers in the fresh
man class, says chair Dave 
Conley. He mentions H&SS fresh
man Neal Zundel as being espe
cially good. I think hes doing 
really well, considering that hes 
a freshman, Conley says.
Predictions: Spirit, Pika, and 
Sigma Nu will finish in that or
der, Conley says. He predicted 
Pika will win the womens compe
tition. I think ATO is going to do 
real well. I think Phi Kap is going 
to do real well. I think Beta is 
going to do real poorly, he says of 
thS"mens competition.
Buggies: Lone Wolf (91), Ren(91), Desperado (90>,
Predator (88)
Last Win: 1990
Spirit
Changes: Vicious Flow will be 
replacing something...
Predictions: We are confident 
that we are competitors for one of 
the top three positions, says chair 
Terence Yarde.
Buggies: Vicious Flow (90), 
Tachy on (89), Quantum Leap 
(87), Genesis^SQ)
Last Win: 1989
Sigma Nu
Changes: Chair Jim Wiley says, 
This year we have new blood and 
new enthusiasm.
Predictions: Well do better 
than last year, predicted Wiley. 
He thinks his main mens compe
tition will be Pika and Spirit.
Buggies: Jama (90), Jerboa 
(86), Colugo (84), Lemur (81)
Last Win: 1985
Theta Xi
Changes: None
Predictions: According to chair 
Christian Borthayre, Spirit will 
win the mens competition, fol
lowed by Pika. The rest of the 
mens Top Ten will be made up of 
two more Pika teams; another 
Spirit buggy; Beta; Sigma Nu; 
ThetaXi; and CIA, Phi Kap, DTD, 
and SDC competing for the final 
two spots, he says. Womens 
teams, watch out, he says of his 
team.
Buggies: Kurgen (91), Caesar 
(88), Nemesis (87), Valkiire (87), 
Little Nip (84)
Last Win: Never
CIA
Changes: In addition to a new 
buggy, Our Hill 2 pusher [senior 
chemical engineering major 
Carlos Rodriguez] has improved 
dramatically from last year, says 
chair Rich Baker.
Predictions: Spirit will win the 
mens competition, Baker says. 
He predicted a Top Ten finish for 
his own team. Thats what were 
aiming for, he says. SDC did 
well last year and should do well 
again this year, Baker predicted. 
He also sees ATO improving.
Buggies: Eclipse (91), Stealth 
(86), Spectre (84)
Last Win: 1981 
SDC
Changes: In addition to a new 
buggy and improvements in Ter
rapin, Our pushers are better 
than ever, says chair JeffShelton.
Predictions: Were not shoot
ing for the top three, but were 
hoping to make the Top Ten, 
Shelton says. Our basic goal is to 
break last years times. He pre
dicted Spirit and Pika as the top 
two mens teams with the choice 
between them being difficult. 
Sigma Nu and Beta are always 
contenders, he says. I think it 
will be interesting, Shelton pre
dicts.
Buggies: Escargot (91), Terra
pin (90), Banzai (86)
Last Win: Never
Kappa Delta Rho
Changes: According to Buggy 
Chair Robert Wright, the KDR 
team has two push captains in
stead of their usual one. Also, 
they have had to replace veteran 
A team pushers.
Predictions: Wright says, Were 
pushing a fast buggy this year, 
and KDR hopes to finish in the 
second half of the top ten mens 
teams. He sees Pika, Spirit, Phi 
Kap, and DU as the big competi
tors in this years race.
Buggies: Paladin (89),
Prometheus (89), Phoenix (87)
Last Win: Never
Delta Tau Delta
Changes: DTD will be running 
a mens C team for the first time 
since 1988, says chair Evan 
Kennedy.
Predictions: I have a positive 
outlook, Kennedy says of his 
teams chances. Regardingthe top 
mens places, he predicts Its go
ing to be neck and neck with Spirit 
and Pika again. He sees close 
results in the top 15 places with 
many teams having shots at the 
Top Ten.
Buggies: Deception (90), Per
ception (90), LOC-NAR (89)
Last Win: 1952
FRINGE
Changes: None
Predictions: Pika and Spirit are 
going to be up there again unless
MEST/N^HDUSE'fOAjf)
something really unpredictable 
happens, says Chair Debra 
Perry. I think the races really 
depend on what happens this 
weekend, she said last Friday, 
noting that some organizations 
had new buggies that probably 
would not qualify if they did not 
roll by this weekend in order to 
get the qualifying 10 rolls. I think 
were looking real good for the 
womens teams, Perry says. 
Were looking to break into the 
top 10 [in the mens races]. If 
youre looking for a good heat  
heat 18, she says referring to the 
mens race between Spirit A, 
FRINGE A, and Phi Kap B.
Buggies: Junior (89), Lunatic 
(88), Barrier (86)
Last Win: Never
Beta Theta Pi
Changes: Beta has gained a new 
buggy and two promising new 
pushers since last year according 
to chair Stan Marshall. Will 
Wojciechowski, a senior math 
major, and JeffPalaima, a junior 
mechanical engineer, will be push
ing after missing last years com
petition for a track meet. H&SS 
freshman Jarrod Siket could pos
sibly set a new Hill 5 record, 
Marshall says.
Predictions: Pika, Beta, Spirit, 
and Sigma Nu will be the top four 
mens teams, barring accidents, 
Marshall predicted. I dont see 
anybody else really posing a 
threat. He forecast an even race 
among the four teams.
Buggies: Undertaker { 91), Mer
cury (89), Challenger (86)
Last Win: 1978
Phi Kappa Theta
Changes: Refinements is the 
term Jack Kingsley, Phi Kap 
buggy chair, used to describe the 
differences in this years buggy 
program. As to what these refine
ments are, Kingsley says, Well 
leave that to everyone to figure 
out when they see the buggy roll. 
Predictions: Phi Kap hopes to 
break its own house record this 
year and possibly to get back in 
the mens Top Ten. It sees the 
field as pretty competitive and 
says its competition is all other 
competitive organizations. 
Buggies: Secretariat (90), Cen
tennial (89), Tempest (88), Duke 
(87)
Last Win: 1973
Delta Upsilon
Changes: While DU is fielding 
a new buggy this year, Dave Ross, 
buggy chair, says, We really 
havent changed that much.
Predictions: DU is hoping to 
have its A team buggy finish in 
the mens Top Ten and its B team 
buggy in the top 20, but Ross 
says, Were just trying to build a 
good buggy. He says there is no 
way of telling who will win this 
year, but thinks it will be between 
Pika, Sigma Nu, Beta, and Spirit.
Buggies: Teal Whistler (91), 
Gargany (90)
Last Win:1947
Alpha Tau Omega
Changes: ATOs program boasts 
a new buggy and a womens team 
this year. There is also a lot of 
excitement in the house for Sweep
stakes, according to co-chair Bill 
Grdanski, noting that ATO re
entered last year for the first time 
in several years.
Predictions: I think were ca
pable of making the Top Ten in 
mens and qualifying in womens, 
Grdanski says. Were minus a 
few of our better, faster guys in 
the house. He predicts Spirit will 
win the mens competition with 
Pika and Phi Kap also doing well.
Buggies: Probation (91), Rebel 
Yell (86)
Last Win: 1962
Pioneers
Changes:Weve expanded the 
program substantially, says 
former Chair Jarrett Smith. Pio
neers has added a new buggy and 
four additional teams, consisting 
of two mens and two womens 
teams.
Predictions: Pioneers hopes to 
finish in the mens top 15 and sees 
its main competition as other A 
teams that do not make the top 
five, such as FRINGE, Phi Kap, 
and SDC. Smith thinks Spirit will 
win, possibly setting a record. He 
also believes Pika will be close 
behind and that ATO is the team 
to watch.
Buggies: Turmoil (91), EDGE 
(89), Pinnacle (88)
Last Win: Never
Sigma Alpha Epsilon
Changes: SAE claims to have 
more changes this year than any 
other. We have a new buggy that
Josh Freeman/ Tartan Photo Staff fv
is quite different and weve focused on pusher training, say 
chair Eric Gropp.
Predictions: Gropp calls th( 
team a dark horse. SAE hope 
to do a lot better this year, finish
ing in the Top Ten. Gropp sees no 
new technology in the leaders and 
says, This years results are up 
to the pushers.
Buggies: Takoohi (91)
Quasimoto (89), Limo (76)
Last Win: 1922
Sigma Tau Gamma
Changes: Sig Tau enters a new 
buggy this year. We worked, qj

drivers to make them roll better, 
says Chair John Hyle.
Predictions: Sig Tau is hoping 
for a top 20 mens finish. Ill be 
extremely happy with a 2:22,2:2? 
finish, says Hyle, This is onlj 
our second year and were getting 
the program established. Our big 
gest competition is ourselves1.' 
Hyle sees the mens race as a tos3 
up between Spirit and Pika.
Buggies: Patriot (91), Vindica 
tor (90)
Last Win: Never
Kappa Sigma
Changes: If they qualify, Kappi 
Sig will enter a new buggy int< 
competition this year. Also, atf 
cording to chair Rich Robinson' 
the new hand protection regul# 
tions forced them to rework.
Predictions: If the new bugg] 
qualifies, Kappa Sig is hoping t< 
make the mens top 20, but 
Robinson says, The basic reasoi 
youre out there is to have furi.11 
He sees the top three teams 
Sigma Nu, Pika, and Spirit.
Buggies: A Good Thing (91) 
Jizwah (89), RDT (90)
Last Win: 1941
Pi Lambda Phi
Changes: The biggest change 
that Pi Lam will be competin) 
again this year. The team did no 
compete last year because o 
changes in buggy specification 
that they could not meet in timf 
says pusher Rich Kwiatkowski.
Predictions: Says Kwiatkowsk 
A big goal for us would be to wi 
our first heat. He predict 
FRINGE and Sigma Nu will, 4

Unsavory weather forecasts gloom for uncertain buggy team
By KATIE CULBERTSON
Tartan Editor-in-Chief
With only one weekend of free rolls 
remaining, several organizations went 
all out this weekend in hopes of taking 
care of last-minute preparations 
before Race Day on Friday.
Trucks carrying precious cargo of 
buggies, tools, and other equipment 
arrived at the bottom of Hill 1 early in 
the mornings. Mechanics and 
chairpeople started tinkering with 
their buggies to prep them for the 
mornings rolls. Drivers wandered out 
to their buggies, and suited up for 
drop tests.
All the wheels were in motion 
Saturday morning when, all of the 
sudden, drip, drip, drip...
The first few drops of rain were 
hardly cause for alarm. But when the
steady drizzle continued past 7 am, the 
chances of buggies rolling grew dim
mer and dimmer. So everyone waited, 
and waited, and waited.
Finally, the Sweepstakes committee 
ruled that the roads were too wet to 
allow free rolls, and sent everyone 
home.
Mother Nature reared her ugly head 
again. Saturday, rolls were cancelled 
altogether. Sunday, although the roads 
were somewhat wet, some organization 
did roll their buggies. Because the 
roads were wet, Sweepstakes Safety 
Chair Sabrina Staley cautioned organi
zations to take it easy on the speed.
According to Assistant Sweepstakes 
Chair Christie Johnson, there is a 
question of safety involved with letting 
the buggies roll on wet roads. But, the 
decision was made in light of preserv
ing competition for Race Day and
maintaining safety. Its hard to 
balance that, said Johnson. Were 
looking to keep the competition. Had 
some organizations not been able to 
roll today, they would have been 
barred from any Race Day participa
tion.
Delta Upsilon is one of these organi
zations. The fraternitys new buggy, 
Teal Whistler, still required several 
rolls to achieve the minimum needed 
for Race Day. We just needed one 
clear day, said DU buggy chair Dave 
Ross. Unfortunately for DU, since the 
last two out of three weekends before 
Race Day were plagued with rain, that 
day did not come.
Instead, the Sweepstakes committee 
made certain adjustments to help DU 
and other organizations to qualify. 
Among them, Staley lowered the 
number of required rolls before Race
Day from 10 to seven. Johnson said 
that this move, although gutsy, was 
necessary. You have to make allow
ances.
The weather and the decisions of the 
Sweepstakes chairpeople will have 
implications for Race Day, among 
them, the element of surprise. Race 
Day will be interesting, said Johnson. 
Some organizations, because they did 
not roll at all this weekend, or rolled 
very slowly, did not have the chance to 
experiment one last time before 
Fridays races. As a result, drivers, 
pushers, and mechanics may not be 
totally prepared for the surprises of 
Race Day.
According to Sweepstakes Chair Ray 
Fratto, drivers may or may not have 
experience in a fast buggy. Sophomore 
Dolly Shen drives for Theta Xi. Since 
Ive driven before, I dont think its as
bad for me as it would be for a neW 
driver, said Shen.
As for the pushers, the weather <3 
also dampen preparations. Senior  
Sambu Dakuginow pushes for Phi 
Kappa Theta, and he feels a definit 
lack of preparation. The most imi* 
tant thing is the exchanges betwea 
pushers, which we didnt get to prfi 
tice, said Dakuginow. Come Friai 
and Saturday, well probably be a 
slower than usual.
Johnson also pushes buggyI 111  
prepared, said Johnson, who has; 
pushed one hill all spring.
Noting the increased negative 
interference of the weather, John1 
would like to see buggy teams oigaj 
better and earlier, before it may br 
late. People really count on the ^ 
weekend more than they should.

Spring Carnival 1991 will bring an 
fray of musical entertainment to camus. Throughout Carnival, bands rangngfrom the rock to the alternative genre 
be featured.
On Thursday night, the Dub Squad, a 
0cal band, will play on the comer stage 
f the midway. Justin Pizzella, Spring 
arnival entertainment chair, says, I 
faiik Dub Squad is the best reggae band 
Pittsburgh. Theyve been around for a 
3ng time, and theyre very good. 
(Several bands will be playing on the 
idway on Friday of Spring Carnival. 
Aging Rain, a new band hailing from 
ffove City, will perform. According to 
Zzella, Stinging Rains music has a 
ghtly U2ish quality but often sounds 
fe Simple Minds. The Mark Eddy Trio 
^..also be performing on Friday. The 
1,0 plays music ranging from Depeche 
|de to classic rock; however, they also 
ay some of their own original music. In 
[tion, CMUs own jazz choir will be 
forming Friday. Finally, EdsRedeemQualities, a folk band, will play. Eds 
leeming Qualities was proclaimed 
Etons best folk band several years ago 
the Village Voice.
Saturday, the Dixieland Travelers,
the only returning band from Carnival 
1990, will perform jazz/Dixie music. An
other local band, Blackfish, will also per
form. Blackfish features rhythm and 
blues music as well as some rock.
Overall, Pizzella says, Personally, I 
think the entertainment for Carnival 
this year is some of the best Ive ever 
seen. It should be great.
The much-anticipated Sunday concert 
headlines two bands. The concert, to be 
held on the Cut, features The Ocean 
Blue and The Clarks.
This will be the first concert appear
ance that either band has made on the 
Carnegie Mellon campus. The Ocean 
Blue, hailing from Hershey, are the main 
band for the concert. The band members 
of The Clarks are natives of Pittsburgh.
The Ocean Blue has released one al
bum, The Ocean Blue, with the Sire record 
label. Many of the songs from the groups 
first and only album are reminiscent of 
the sounds of Haircut One Hundred and 
Echo & the Bunnymen. Brian Lasley, a 
freshman in H&SS who saw The Ocean 
Blue perform in Galveston, Texas, says, 
They were really good in concert. They 
gave a great show.
Pizzella, who is also AB Concert chair, 
says he has seen The Clarks perform a 
number of times, and they give consis
tently good performances.

The Clarks are scheduled to play at 2 pm on the Cut Sunday afternoon.

As of 7 pm tonight, Skibo park
ing lot will turn into the midway 
for Carnival.
In order to make sure the lot is 
empty by 7 pm, when organiza
tions begin to assemble their 
booths on the lot, parkers will not 
be allowed to park in the lot. 
Starting at 3 pm we are going to 
discourage people from parking 
there, says Mark Patrick, Carni
val chair. Starting the process so 
early ensures that those cars 
which park in meter parking ar
eas will be forced to leave the lot 
by 5 pm. Those people who do not 
have permits must remove their 
cars by 5 pm as well. People with 
permits in the Skibo parking lot 
and the Warner Hall lot have been 
issued city permits which will al
low them to park on the street.
The parking garage will also be 
affected, but not as heavily. All 
cars must enter and exit using 
the Beeler Street entrance only. 
The Skibo entrance will be closed.

with Fulbright
Thomas Nichols/Tartan Senior Photographer 
Montserrat Marti Miller has been given a Fulbright Scholarship to study in Spain.
Scholar
By TRUPTI PATEL
Tartan Asst. Features Editor
A young woman from a small town in 
West Virginia finally has the chance to 
fulfill the dreams of a lifetime. Montserrat 
Marti Miller, a doctoral candidate in 
European social history, was recently 
awarded a Fulbright Scholarship  a 
scholarship thats going to allow her to 
do a lot of things she never dreamed 
possible.
Miller, a 1983 graduate of Marshall 
University in West Virginia, never imag
ined that she would have the opportu
nity to live in the magnificent city she 
discovered in her childhood. The 
Fulbright Scholarship gives Miller the 
chance to rediscover her mothers native 
city, Barcelona, Spain.
As a winner of the Fulbright Scholar
ship, Miller will receive the money nec
essary to travel to and live in Barcelona 
for nine months. Her adventure begins 
in October of this year and will continue 
through June of 1992. While in Spain, 
she plans to study the local market econo
mies of cities, Barcelona in particular, as 
a part of her dissertation, titled Mar
kets and Market Women in Barcelona, 
1900-1950.
Although she is eager to conduct her 
research, Miller is also enthusiastic about 
reviving her cultural heritage. As a 
youngster, Miller learned to speak Span
ish and Cataln (a language of northern 
Spain) fluently. She says, My parents 
instilled both a curiosity for Hispanic 
culture, and then specifically, a lot of 
Catalonia [a province in northern Spain], 
in me.
Ive never had the opportunity to spend 
nine months [in Barcelona], says Miller. 
When I was young, I spent the summer 
there on three occasionswhen I was 7,
11, and 16. And since then, Ive never 
been able to afford, both economically or 
in terms of time, to spend more than six 
weeks over there. And I always have to 
pull myself away when I come back to the 
United States.
realizes
Miller would hke her daughters, Lenna 
and Elizabeth, to learn to love Barcelona 
in the same way that she has. Both 
children speak Cataln and will be trav
eling to Barcelona with their mother.
Ive tried very hard to instill in my 
children a curiosity forthe Cataln heri
tage and its important for me to give 
them an education in which they will be 
able to establish a proficiency in the 
Cataln language, says Miller. Im ex
cited because [the Fulbright] gives me a 
chance to live in Barcelona. Im also 
excited for the educational opportunities 
its going to offer my children.
All in all, the excitement of winning 
and realizing some lifelong dreams have 
been a little overwhelming for Miller. 
She says that she never expected to win 
a scholarship. On the one hand I really 
felt like [winning the Fulbright] was a 
very long shot. But I thought applying to 
CMU in the first place was a long shot 
and I managed to get in here.
The last time Miller traveled to Spain 
was in 1989, with her two daughters. 
While I was [in Barcelona], I concluded 
that I really needed to study European 
history  that I needed to unite my 
interests in Cataln history and culture 
with my graduate studies in history, 
says Miller. Ever since her 1989 trip, 
Miller has been fascinated with the role 
of markets in Europe.
She anticipates that the Barcelona trip 
will be an excellent opportunity to com
plete the vast majority of her disserta
tion research. Im excited about the 
Fulbright because its going to mean that 
Im going to be able to get my Ph.D. 
sooner; I can do all my research in one 
fell swoop as opposed to having to split it 
up over various summers, says Miller.
Specifically, Miller intends to examine 
the role of markets in the urban setting 
of Barcelona. She says, The unique thing 
about Barcelona in particular is that 
there are still forty viable markets in 
operation, whereas in other European 
cities you find much fewer than forty. 
And in other European cities, supermardreams
kets have eroded the clientele far more 
extensively than in Barcelona.
This dissertation is about food mar
kets, but its a dissertation about South
ern Europe in general terms. Its a case 
study of one place in Southern Europe in 
an effort to distinguish certain patterns 
of urban sociability. Im interested in 
placing Catalonia in the context of Spain 
and then Europe, says Miller.
Even though she decided to apply for 
the Fulbright on her own initiative, she 
says that the history department at CMU 
was very supportive of her endeavors.
According to Miller, the whole process 
of applying for the Fulbright was an 
arduous task. When she finally received 
notice that her application had made it 
through preliminary rounds of evalua
tion, she was elated.
'Sometime in March, I got this cable
gram. It looked like junk mail! So I came 
in with my kids and made them dinner... 
then I went over and was looking through 
the junk mail  standing in the kitchen 
and I was about to toss it in the garbage. 
And then I opened it up and it was a 
cablegram saying Congratulations, 
youve been awarded a 1990 Fulbright 
Award. I was pretty ecstatic and 
shocked, says Miller.
Millers two children are also eagerly 
awaiting the October trip to Spain. [The 
childrens] initial reaction was excite
ment and elation, Miller says of when 
she told them she won the award. For 
months, theyve been asking When are 
we going back to Barcelona? When are 
we going back? 
When her children would ask her that 
question, Miller always had to tell them
 disappointingly  that she did not 
know when they would be able to return. 
As a single parent trying to raise two 
children while simultaneously pursuing 
a doctorate degree, Miller thought she 
would be unable to return to Barcelona 
for a long time.
Thus, the Fulbright scholarship rep
resents the culmination of an especially 
tough climb for Miller. The recent award
is a final triumph in achieving a goal that 
was against the odds. Despite the fact 
that it was tough to earn her degrees 
when she had children, Miller says, I 
couldnt have done any of this without 
them.
For the future, Miller says her goals 
are to work hard to complete her disser
tation. By 1992, she would like to be able 
to look for a job to establish herself as a 
college professor as well as researcher. 
Ultimately, Miller wants to write a book 
about her studies, experiences, and discoveries in Barcelona and throughout 
Spain.
For now, Millers future revolves 
around her concerns for her two daugh
ters.
Right now, we live in a crowded apart
ment and theres no place for them to 
play outside. I want to find a job where I 
can get a small house with a little yard so 
I can send the kids out to play, says 
Miller. Thats one of my personal goals 
 to get a place where my kids can play 
outside

Moscow to Beijing: The longest train ride youll ever take
Day One: At this very moment Im 
bouncing along in a train that is making 
its way from Moscow to Beijing on the 
Trans-Siberian Railway. Our recent 36- 
Hour ride from Budapest to Moscow seems 
like' a hop compared to the six-and-ahalf-day journey that lies ahead. Before 
embarking on this journey, I expected 
the scenery to be interesting. Well, we 
havent reached Siberia yet, but all Ive 
se&tl so far is snowsometimes as much 
as ttoo feet thick on the roofs of the small, 
scattered wooden houses.
About an hour ago, however, I did 
catch a glimpse of a small village through 
the dark. It contained a large, empty 
meeting hall, a train station, a small 
church, and a few houses. I even wit
nessed a Russian family of four sitting 
down to dinner. But soon the train win
dow was black again, conveying the gen
eral desolation of the region. I stop tak
ing the warmth and security of the train 
for granted in these lonely-looking places.
TRAVELOGUE
by Debra Sax
As the hours of the day slowly crawl by, 
I am becoming several homemade foods 
 simple flour and water cakes, jars of 
pickles and sauces, and sometimes Rus
sian vodka.
Here, these women sell their wares to 
hungry travelers for triple the price they 
would normally receive. Later on, one of 
the trains employees asked us if we had 
any cassette tapes, and throughout the 
day we heard the sounds of Gordon 
Lightfoot, Tom Petty, and Simon and 
Garfunkel playing through the cars
speakers. What a carefree feelingcruis
ing along in the snow and sunshine to 
the sounds of Every Highway. This 
evening, a small crowd of Chinese folks 
gathered outside our compartment, at
tracted by our attempt to speak their 
language. We passed around a few maga
zines and catalogs to show them pictures 
of America. In China, America is known 
as Meiguoi, a word that means beauti
ful country.
One woman made the comment that 
all American women look alike. I found 
her statement absurd at first, but soon 
realized that is was quite logical; after 
all, most Americans cannot tell Japa
nese from Chinese people  to us they 
all look alike.
Just a moment ago, a young Chinese 
fellow knocked on our door. He entered, 
looking nervous, and eventually we un
derstood that his friends were carrying 
some animal horns that they bought in 
the Soviet Union. They plan to sell them
in China for use in drug manufacturing, 
but carrying them into China is illegal. 
They are convinced that we, as Ameri
cans, will have no trouble with the cus
toms officials; so this young fellow tries 
to convince us to carry the horns in our 
bags. Before boarding the train we had 
filled out written declarations stating 
that we were not carrying any drugs or 
any possessions belonging to others, so 
we politely refused his pleading. Per
haps he and his friends will not be 
searched thoroughly, or perhaps they 
can get by by bribing the official. In any 
case, wed rather not get involved.
Day Three: Today I saw some small 
houses painted in the liveliest of colors  
shades of yellow, purple, and even tur
quoise, with patterns of white criss-cross
ing. They added life to the otherwise dull 
terrain. I hopped off the train to mail a 
letter and was separated from my train 
by another long train that blocked my 
path. I soon was filled with fear  what
would happen if my train started with 
out me?
As it was, the other train passed by 
with no minutes to spare, but I waiscared by the event. I wonder about tht' 
employees of the train  do they ridethis train back and forth, week after 
week? I feel sorry for the families they 
leave behind.
Time is such a strange concept. Tht 
train runs on Moscow time. If we con ' 
tinue to do so, however, when we arrive' 
in Beijing our watches will be six hours 
off. In order to avoid the adjustment 
later, we decided to switch to Beijing 
time today, losing six . hours just likethat!
Day Four: Today I read a lot oi 
Solzhenitsyns novel, The First Circle. If 
takes place during the Stalin era and is* 
quite freaky  especially because its" 
based on fact. I can understand why 
some Soviet citizens might have chosenPlease see TRAVELOGUE, page L7-
Simon: Human advancement keys on knowledge, curiosity
By MARC ROSTON
Special to The Tartan
Last Tuesday, Professor 
Herbert A. Simon gave the longawaited, concluding installment 
of the Last Lecture Series. The 
Last Lecture Series gave several 
of.Carnegie Mellons most distin
guished faculty members the 
chance to give their ultimate lec
ture  the lecture they would 
give as if it were to be their last.
The title of Simons lecture, The 
Cat that Curiosity Couldnt Kill, 
stimulated much speculation be
fore the lecture began. Unfortu
nately for the curious audience 
that packed the Faculty Dining 
Room, Simon promptly explained 
that not only was he not the cat in 
question, but that he also had no 
idea who was.
Using his uncanny ability to 
communicate to an audience, 
Simon summarized his current
research as the study of problem 
solving and its applications to cre
ativity and scientific research.
Simon presented some inter
esting as well as controversial 
concepts to the audience. One of 
these ideas is that it takes 10 
years of intensive study to be
come an expert in anything.
According to Simon, this ap
plies to playing chess, solving en
gineering problems, and even 
sports.
In the second half of the lecture 
Simon presented a future research 
proposal. He believes that curios
ity is an essential element of cre
ativity and discovery; thus, he 
feels that people need a better 
understanding of what causes 
curiosity.
Simon proposes studying how 
different emotions and events 
change levels of curiosity in hu
mans.
Finally, Simon addressed a
question Carnegie Mellon stu
dents often face: how is the re
searcher to judge the morality of 
what he or she finds? Scientific 
discovery brings knowledge which 
must be examined in the context 
in which it was discovered.
Simon said, Special Relativity 
didnt build the bomb. He adds 
that researchers need to antici
pate the applications of new 
knowledge and understand where 
ideas fit into the big picture.
Simon concluded that, for the 
most part, knowledge has been 
good for humanity.
Student responses to his words 
seemed quite positive.
Senior Chemical Engineer Matt 
Fraser said, As a student enter
ing graduate school next year, I 
was reminded that I must con
sider the implications of my re
search work. I doubt I would have 
considered work which I did not 
think was morally correct, but
now I know the reminder will 
always be there. I will examine 
the consequences.
Dr. Simons speech was more 
technical than I had anticipated
said junior mechanical engineer
ing major Peter Blossey. I had 
been expecting something more 
autobiographical becaus of the 
recent release of his book [.Models of My Life], but it was quite 
interesting. Blossey continued, 
The Last Lecture Series has been 
great. I hope it continues next 
year.

Play-Doh offers important metaphor to life
There is little doubt in my mind 
that humans are an intrinsically 
totemistic species. The mytholo
gies of countless individuals and 
civilizations have been built upon 
the identification of crucial as
pects of living in animate and 
inanimate objects. I, personally, 
have taken many animate and 
inanimate objects as represen
tative of the many vicissitudes 
which I have encountered 
through the course of my life. 
The following is by no means a 
complete summary of the many 
objects which are fraught with 
meaning in the sphere of my 
conscious and unconscious mind. 
But then again, you probably 
dont know me that well.
One of the main articles which 
I have adopted as a signifier of 
my approach to life is a device 
known as an envelope filter. This 
contraption is better known to 
the world as the Wah-Wah 
pedal. For me and the dozens of 
other children who spent count
less pre-teen Saturday after
noons watching blaxploitation
JaviVision
by Javier Grillo-Marxuach
films on Detroits own channel 
62, the Wah-Wah pedal was the 
ever present current underscor
ing our daily lives. One can hardly 
imagine the possibility of adopt
ing that early seventies, pre-pubescent, streetwise, Black Belt 
Jones swagger if it were not for 
the existence of the Wah-Wah 
pedal. To this day, I seldom walk 
down the street without hearing 
the theme from Shaft echoing 
faintly inside my head.
As an artist, I have always 
sought to discover pliability wher
ever it may be found. Because the 
ability to mold myself and my 
medium into whatever expression 
best fits the occasion is such a 
concern, I have chosen Play-Doh
as the totem for my desire to cre
ate. As a toy substance, Play-Doh 
remains closest to the artistic 
medium it seeks to emulate, as it 
becomes hard and dry when ex
posed to heat, giving every project 
fashioned from the substance an 
air of permanence. In addition, 
when improperly used, Play-Doh 
crumbles into dust, an important 
metaphor to life in and of itself.
Another important facet of the 
Play-Doh experience is that PlayDoh is not only a key manner in 
which children may express their 
creative needs, it is also one of the 
tastiest toy substances ever cre
ated. Personally, I find that the 
blue Play-Doh has a tangy, after
dinner-cordial sort of flavor which 
I recall having found infinitely 
delightful at the age of 6. At this 
age, Play-Doh was also an impor
tant function ofthe preschool caste 
system, as those of us who con
sumed Play-Doh considered our
selves to be imminently superior 
to the ones who satiated their 
hunger with Crayola crayons.
After the pre-school years, one
Play-Doh is not only a key manner in 
which children may express their cre
ative needs, it is also one ofthe tastiest 
toy substances ever created.
of the important markers of the 
coming of age ofthe sensitive art
ist is the presence of a composi
tion notebook. These totems, 
whose black and white marbled 
covers lent them an air of almost 
Teutonic austerity and inner turmoil, housed the tortured 
thoughts and dark souls of many 
a poetically inclined third-grader. 
My personal favorite scribbling 
from my own composition third 
grade confidential reads Dark
ness. I am enveloped in a cloak of 
Darkness, much like that of Darth 
Vader.
Of course, these pangs of pre
adolescent angst were soon left 
behind as I grew to become a man. 
In ancient times, one did not be
come a man until one completed
the ritual of consuming the blood 
of the first deer one killed. In the 
twentieth century, this ritual has 
been replaced. The coming of age 
of a young man can be witnessed 
in the first can of V-8 he can 
consume without resorting to that 
other ritual referred to as 
ralphing.
Whereas the killing of the deer 
once represented coming of age as 
the vindication of a young mans 
virility, the drinking of the V-8 
represents coming of age as that 
time in which the young persons 
steady diet of Hostess Ninja Turtle 
Pies has eliminated enough taste 
buds so as to make the taste of the 
blood-red tomato and celery con
coction palatable.
As I have matured, the things
which meant the most to me as a 
youngster have grown more so
phisticated. I no longer look ^9/.

to live in Siberia  the further away 
from Stalin, the better! I see dozens of 
huge gray apartment buildings  a sure 
sign of socialism. Weve seen many in 
Eastern Europe and Moscow, but I didnt 
expect to see mass housing projects out 
here where the land is so plentiful. We 
passed by Irkutsk and Lake Baikal, sup
posedly the worlds largest freshwater 
lake.
Again I left the train a few times  
once to buy postcards and a second time 
to mail them. It seems strange to be 
mailing things from out here. Who knows 
how long it will take them to reach the 
States? At one late-night stop, I observed 
the steps that are taken to keep the train 
in good order. Several workers run 
around knocking ice from various parts 
of the train; others check for malfunc
tions. Then the bathrooms are given a 
new supply of water, and the dining 
room is restocked with food. In just a few 
hours the whole procedure must be re
peated. Its obvious that many folks, es
pecially those with children, are stressed; 
they want nothing more than to get the 
hell off this train. But, unlike me, most of 
them are going home. In two days I will 
find myself in a vastly different culture. 
Im not quite sure what to expect.
One woman made the comment that all Ameri
can women look alike. I found her statement 
absurd at first, but soon realized that is was 
quite logical; after all, most Americans cannot 
tell Japanese from Chinese people  to us they 
all look alike.
Day Five: Today we crossed the border 
into China!
In the morning a woman pleaded with 
us in Russian to carry an extra coat or 
two in our compartment, just to hide 
them from Soviet customs. She seemed 
so desperate that I wanted to help her, 
but we again chose not to get involved. 
We didnt want to get in trouble; we also 
didnt think it was right of her to be 
taking so many coats away from Soviet 
citizens, and we didnt approve of her 
willingness to use innocent folks to carry 
her load. As it was, customs inspection 
was very strange. As predicted by our 
fellow passengers, the Russian officials 
didnt look at a thing of ours  yet with 
all the people around us they were thor
ough.
The passengers to our right were 
caught smuggling more than 50 home
made handkerchiefs (apparently an ille
gal item when taken in quantities), while 
the Chinese passengers on our left had 
many of their horns confiscated. These 
folks glared at us because we, as Ameri
cans, were not given similar treatment. 
They didnt realize that it wouldnt have 
disturbed us if we had been searched  
we, unlike they, had nothing to hide.
We waited at the border for hours 
because each train car had to be lifted 
individually so that the wheels could be 
adjusted. The train tracks in China are 
of a different gauge. We soon reached the 
Chinese customs area, and again we 
were undisturbed while the others were 
inspected. We were given a form to fill
out to declare what valuables we were 
bringing into the country. One of the 
questions asked us to list all foreign 
currencies we were carrying. Since weve 
been traveling for five months in various 
countries, we actually have 11 different 
types of money with us! I just noticed 
that they added a Chinese dining car to 
our train, so I went inside to check the 
menu. The smell was so awesome  it 
reminded my of waiting tables at the 
Szechuan House in Squirrel Hill.
But we cant buy anything in the din
ing car or anywhere else in China until 
we get our hands on some yuan; we 
may have 11 types of currency on us, but 
were lacking the only one that has value 
here. So, before I sleep, Ill try to sell 
some vodka and champagne to one of 
these restless passengers.
Day Six: Today we woke up and began 
packing our things. In only five days 
weve managed to scatter many things 
around our compartment. Soon, how
ever, we are informed that we will not 
arrive in Beijing until tomorrow morn
ing. We say goodbye to our fellow passen
gers from northern China  they arrive 
at home today.
Perhaps because it is so empty, the 
atmosphere on the train becomes much 
more relaxed. I think it is much better to
take the train than to fly to Asia. This*' 
way, I feel myself getting closer slowly; r 
as more Chinese enter the train and lb 
more Russians leave. rrJi
I see small, hut-like homes, smaller iii r$j 
size and different in flavor than the homes 
of the Siberians. Many are decorated 0 
with small banners and colored crepe js 
paper  what I guess to be remnants ol 
from the Chinese New Year celebration in 
of one week ago. Chinese radio stations jj 
and the chatter of the Chinese people.>1 
make me aware of how little Chinese I rU 
can understand. My first realization that ;j>
I was in China occurred today, when I bi 
went into a train station to go to the 
bathroom. I was surprised to find a por;>.o 
celain hole in the place of a toilet. After a 18 
calm day, I again settle down to what I 1 
hope will be our last night on the train. 1 
Day seven: We were awakened by the ! 
trains crew at 5:20 am and told that we 1 
would arrive in one hour. Beijing, or I 
what we saw of it from the train, did not 1 
seem like a typical large city  there 1 
were no tall buildings, and bicycles far ; 
outnumbered other forms of transportation. As we got off the train, one of the j 
crew members gave me a tiny pin with j 
the words Moscow-Peking written in ; 
Russianone small souvenir to remind ; 
me of the longest train ride Ill ever tA&fe. j
Southern cops challenge L.A. stereotype ... at the speed limit
When we think of Southern law 
enforcement, most of us imagine 
overbearing, overweight, para
noid Bible-thumpers right out of 
the Dukes of Hazzard. (Usually 
complete with a bumbling, stupid 
fellow officer, and a drooling 
hound dog in the back seatof the 
patrol car.)
They are the policemen of our 
nightmares.
Many Northern folks are quite 
afraid of the Southern law en
forcement.
They are scared to death of be
ing stopped in their paranoid fan
tasies by a drawling officer who 
not only gives them a ticket for 
going one mile per hour over the 
limit while going downhill, but 
makes them get out of the car to 
search them and all of their pos
sessions, complete with an anus 
check.
Television shows and movies 
seem to rack up the negatives of 
Southern police forces. Paranoid 
and drawling officers are depicted 
as racists and religious zealots.
Just look at films like Footloose, 
where cops pull over Kevin Bacon 
to bully him and confiscate his 
tapes for playing heavy metal on 
his car stereo.
Films likeiioz/se Party also cash 
in on these images, with police 
patrolling black neighborhoods 
and hostilely searching people 
without reason.
However, it has been a long 
time since the sixties  since 
heavy metal music had been de
nounced by popular Southern TV 
preachers. AND its been a long 
time since white offenders could 
he spared a speeding ticket by 
showing the officer a KKK mem
bership card.
SOUTHERN COMFORT
by Alison Carter
Very few, if any, innocent people 
are dragged into Southern jails 
for being pulled over by a high
way patrolman.
Robin Williams lampooned police-ophobia in his Live at the 
Met act, exagerrating lawmen 
under the Manson-Nixon Line 
as police obsessed with confiscat
ing drugs in any form, and who 
assume that if you drive a BMW, 
youre Jewish.
They then are supposed to drag 
you into jail to lock you up with a 
very large, homosexual roommate 
named Bubba.
Is that the image that would 
come into your mind if you got 
pulled over, going 65 miles per 
hour in a 55 miles per hour zone 
at 3 am in the middle of Nowhere, 
Alabama?
Chances are, if you grew up 
with those images of police in 
your mind, you probably would. 
You would pull over, shaking in 
your boots, head in your hands. 
He would stop behind you, lights 
flashing, and slowly open the door 
of his car to pull himself out and 
swagger over to your window. 
There would be a briefptui as he 
hocks out a chaw of tobacco.
 Scuse me, can Ah see yer 
license? You hand it to him. 
Whar you from? You tell him 
where youre from, and wherever
it is, its way far north of wher
ever you are now.
Weeee-il, did ya know you was 
goin 10 miles over the limit? 
You say you didnt look at your 
speedometer. Well, okay. 
Scratches his head, and hocks out 
some more tobacco spit near your 
back tire.
Lissen, Im not on patrol now, 
but you might have had ta pay the
county about $60 now if I were. 
Actually, I pulled ya over to tell, 
ya yer right headlight gone out. 
Yew should get it fixed soon, cuz 
its dangerous.
You meekly say yes sir, and 
he tells you to drive carefully and 
slowly, and watch out for the 
drunks.
He pulls back onto the highway 
and leaves.
Thats the usual type of conver
sation that goes on between po
lice and offenders down in the 
South.
The only time he would ask you 
about your business is if you 
looked drunk, or were driving a 
red Porsche at 80 mph and wear
ing 10 pounds of gold chain around 
your neck.
Southern cops dont pull you
over for playing Guns n Roses on 
your tape deck. They dont search j 
you, unless you dont have a li
cense on you when they pull you 
over... or if you smell like a brew-_ 
ery.
Alison Carter is a freshman trj, 
the College of Fine Arts. She drives 
like a wild banshee ... going 55 
mph, of course.

Jesus-frSenior Ty Taylor) cries out in anguish as he's being crucified.
0uperstar marks 
seasons final blowout
Director Billy Wilsons places another 
diamond in CMU Dramas crown
one of those rare figures in the 
profession who genuinely 
justifies the phrase interna
tionally renowned, and his 
terpsichorean background 
pervades every proverbial nook 
and cranny of the performance. 
Nobody stagnates or wanders 
about onstage  every limb 
seems to follow a predetermined 
trajectory in a calculus of 
moving bodies. Wilsons exper
tise is most apparent during the 
final, chaotic scenes of mob 
violence. The fickle crowd 
doesnt merely harass Jesus, 
but streams around him like a 
taunting, swirling maelstrom. 
The overall effect nicely comple
ments the atmosphere provided 
by the other elements of the 
musical.
The wardrobe is eyebrowraising, to say the least. Jesus 
parades around in a white 
sports jacket, and the local 
clergy are ghoulishly clothed as 
military officers. Superstar is a 
jarring blend of alien cultures, 
and great effort has gone into
sustaining this key cosmetic 
feature of the musical.
However, high quality as it 
may be, Superstar does not get 
off scot-free. Devoted Webberites will be irritated by cuts 
from some musical numbers.' 
Although Webbers brilliant 
score was necessarily pruned for 
the small orchestral ensemble, 
some of the music has been 
unforgivably watered down  
the most blatant offender being 
the bland percussion during the 
Overture.
Furthermore, one cant shake 
the impression that the entire 
production is being rushed 
along at an uncomfortable pace. 
Nearly all the music seems to 
have been sped up by a factor of 
thirty percent, and the origi
nally pleasantly jumpy Herods 
Song5 has been accelerated into 
a frenzied can-can. The musical 
was also beset by a slew of 
trifling technical problems that, 
in unison, disturbingly de
tracted from the continuity of 
the performance. Though one
might expect a little roughness 
on opening night, the dozens of 
little annoyances  from the 
fringe of distortion on some of 
the microphones to the audible 
clomping of the dancers 
unhidden by a too-quiet orches
tra  made it difficult to lose 
oneself in the drama until well 
into the second act.
But one shouldnt harp on 
impurities and ignore the 
gemstone beneath. Superstar is 
highly enjoyable entertainment 
from a class thats given us 
winner after winner in musical 
drama, and is the sort of work 
that really evokes ones appre
ciation for having such a repu
table drama department as oncampus ministers of diversion.
Dont even think about 
getting tickets by any means 
short of murder  theyve 
almost completely sold out  
but those of you who are plan
ning to catch Superstar some
time in the next few weeks can 
look forward to a enjoyable and 
moving treat.

plumes of smoke hiss from 
below. Sneering pharisees 
emerge like rats from unseen 
doorways of blackness. And if 
youre not careful, you almost 
miss the unobtrusive cluster of 
musicians perched atop a 
rampart while they deliver their 
ominous serenade.
The performance is impres
sive, if not seamless. Ty Taylor 
concludes his award-winning 
tour of duty in CMUs Drama 
Department with the challeng
ing lead role. Playing Jesus is 
something way beyond a 
dream, he confides. I like 
playing the part so much ... 
because it seems like something 
thats so unreachable. Taylors 
solid, resounding voice is a 
superb vessel for Christs 
pathos, though his expression 
seems somewhat glazed 
throughout the production.
As the anguished, driven 
Judas, Jack Plotnick sings with 
a stringy, elfin tonality that 
initially takes some getting 
used to. Yet he suffers least 
from the tradeoff between 
musical vigor and emotional 
expressiveness, and plays his 
role  which involves more 
mood swings and neuroses than 
a hypochondriac inspecting a 
leper colony  with a moving
authenticity. Plotnick himself 
stresses the importance of 
maintaining the effect of the 
part. You have to learn to act 
through the song, he com
ments. You cant just turn off 
your mind and sing.
Natalie Belcons soulful, 
passionate performance of Mary 
Magdalene is the greatest force 
lulling the audience into the 
world of the musical. As a 
thousand annoyances vie to jerk 
us into concrete reality, she 
urges us to immerse ourselves 
into the story. Belcons syrupy 
voice and flowing movements 
seem like part of the music, 
rather than superimpositions 
upon it. Its very passionate, 
remarks Belcon about the score. 
It hits you deep down in your 
gut.
Other notable performances 
included Eric Woodalls brief 
but personable role as Simon 
Zealot and the garishly-dressed 
Mark Brettschneiders stint as 
the depraved Herod  although 
this last was tragically drowned 
out by the kings over-enthusi
astic underlings.

To the casual observer, Jesus 
Christ Superstar is fraught with 
flagrant irreverence. Biblical 
keynotes are portrayed as 
outlandish caricatures. Dusty, 
archaic aphorisms are transinto contemporary jargon. 
|And the music  so passion
ately secular, so seductively 
|rakish and offbeat  is hardly 
what you would expect to hear 
wafting through stained-glass 
Windows on a Sunday morning. 
Yet after a few minutes, only 
the most provincial in the 
audience will fail to see that 
pice and Webbers interpreta
tion of the most famous riseand-fall story in Western 
history brings it to life rather 
fhan ridicules or demeans it.
If anything, Superstar is more

Geraldo Rivera guns for the Pulitzer
I just found out that Geraldo 
Rivera bought a newspaper in 
Monmouth County, New Jersey, 
and installed himself as manag
ing editor. Hes not giving up his 
TV show or anything  he juat 
decided that he could be njr ag
ing editor as a part-time job, like 
working nights at Dennys. Hell 
breeze through the office two, 
three times a week, give out some 
story assignments, and, of course, 
personally inspect the color sepa
rations to make sure all the pri
mary and secondary colors are 
represented. Hell say things like, 
Hey, Stan, great piece on the 
new zebra at the zoo. We should 
have a sidebar like that every 
week. But next time, could we get 
some pictures of the zebra actu
ally having sex?
The first thing he said, when he 
bought the paper, was that he 
intends to do sensitive features 
about the community, and em
phasize environmental issues in 
his coverage.
I was amazed. Geraldo Rat
ings Rivera said this? Geraldos 
gonna do the kind of stories that 
win journalism awards and no
body ever reads?
But I was reassured by the first 
issue Geraldo actually supervised. 
The page one headline read, 
Child Pornography Charges 
Overturned: Midgets Prove 
Theyre Eighteen.
Geraldos first Sunday paper 
had a lengthy feature essay on 
Jim Morrison: The Myth, The 
Legend, The Reality, The Movie, 
The Junkie. The entire editorial 
board attended a seance in which 
a New Jersey psychic discussed 
Jims sexual prowess with Janis 
Joplin.
Of course, Monmouth County 
is mostly quiet suburbs, so a few

of the housewives were upset 
when the paper started doing a 
special Wednesday feature called 
Kuwait City: Is Monmouth 
County Next? complete with pho
tos of chemical weapons being 
used by Iraqi troops on Kurdish 
peasants. If you read down into 
the story, you discovered that the 
terrain of Monmouth County is 
exactly like some of the remoter 
parts of Kurdistan, and so it would 
be one of the few places in the 
world where Saddam Hussein 
would still feel comfortable wag
ing war.
Sensationalism? I think not. I 
think its time Monmouth County 
had a healthy dose of reality.
Some people scoffed when the 
paper hired a new transsexual 
columnist, Monica Duke 
Scranton. But it has turned out to 
be very talented. Dukes first col
umn dealt with discount cosmet
ics available indowntown Asbury 
Park, and the new regulations on 
Monmouth Beach that make it 
illegal for genetic males to wear 
French-cut bikinis.
It was not until Geraldo arrived 
that they learned how to promote 
a newspaper. Everyone purchas
ing a years subscription now re
ceives a complimentary cocktail 
at Caesars in Atlantic City, one 
free round of keno, and Telly
Savalas autograph.
And it has become more socially 
conscious. Geraldo was the first 
to do a complete issue devoted to 
the Just Say No anti-drug cam
paign. The lead story that day 
was Monmouth Countians Talk 
About Doing Drugs. The main 
sports story was Athletes Who 
Take Steroids. The Lifestyles 
section featured a take-out called 
Housewives Who Take Sleeping 
Pills To Avoid Sex. And the busi
ness page lead story was Co
caine or Heroin? Which One is 
Americas Biggest Business? Who 
Gets the Money? Who Sells Those 
Little Spoons? How Many Junk
ies Do We Have in Monmouth 
County? Do They Pay On Time?
And they said this man couldnt 
manage an American newspaper.
I hope the Pulitzer committee is 
watching.
Speaking of unnatural muta
tions, Bride of Re-Animator is fi
nally here, continuing the story of 
Herbert Wests experiments 
where he injects green serum into 
dead bodies and watches them 
start twitching, frothing at the 
mouth, and eventually eating one 
another. The original Re-Anima
tor came out in 1985 and was the 
first movie ever made where a 
principal actor loses his head half
way through the movie, but fin
ishes the movie.
Theyve gone that one better. 
The same actor, David Gale, is 
back in this movie  or at least 
part of him  is back. His head 
gets fourth billing in the sequel. 
What a talent!
This time, Dr. West has been 
down in Peru, where he discovers 
a magic iguana and starts scream
ing Reptiles are the key! We will 
create new life! If you mix iguana 
juice with the green serum, you
can not only pump life into dead 
people, you can pump life into 
body parts without even using a 
brain. So Dr. West starts doing 
things like grafting four fingers 
to an eyeball and then making it 
come to life. (Its like a spider, but 
it can turn doorknobs and flirt 
with other species.)
Herbert Wests partner-ingross, Dr. Daniel Cain, is back in 
the second movie, too, and he still 
hasnt gotten over his dead girl
friend. Fortunately, Dr. West 
saved her heart, and so if they can 
just collect enough body parts and 
enough serum ... yep, its the old 
Frankenhooker theme again. But 
this time the head of Wests arch
enemy, Dr. Hill, is busy over in 
the pathology lab trying to talk 
one of his colleagues into sewing 
bat wings to his ears so he can 
have a more ambulatory life as a 
flying head.
In other words, they did it again.
Its got everything the original 
had.

Tommy Conwell and George Thorogood tear down the Syria Mosque
By KEVIN BARNEY
Tartan Contributing Editor
For several weeks now, weve 
been hearing about the destruc
tion of the Syria Mosque. How it 
was sold by the Knights of Colum
bus to a development company 
that plans to tear it down. That 
1 several groups within Pittsburgh 
were formed to try and stop the 
imminent destruction of the 
Mosque.
Unfortunately for these groups, 
last Saturday night it finally hap
pened.... The mosque was brought 
down.
Wait a second. What happened 
to these groups of protesters? Did 
they just pack it in and go home to 
have a few cold ones? No. I can tell 
you what happened to these 
groups. They were taken out by 
opponents from a unforeseen 
source. The people that brought 
the Mosque down were not driv
ing wrecking balls and bulldoz
ers, they were manning guitars, 
saxes, and drum sets. They were 
Tommy Conwell and George 
Thorogood. Last Saturday they 
brought the house down when 
they performed a three-hour con
cert at the mosque.
In the day and age of Paula 
Abdul, Milli Vanilli, Madonna, 
and other assorted wanna-be rock 
stars, its good to know that bands 
like Tommy Conwell and the 
Young Rumblers are still emerg
ing. Last year, the new rock cn 
roll band on the street was the 
Black Crowes. This year, its 
Tommy and the rest of his gang.
 Concert Review 
TOMMY CONWELL AND GEORGE 
THOROGOOD. Aa ahd S/hia Me+qpd 
la+a Saaphda/ nigha.
After playing a couple of songs 
from both of their albums, Tommy 
and his band went into a nice long 
jam, where Tommy ended up play
ing the guitar behind his back, 
between his legs, and behind his 
head while the keyboardist, Rob 
Miller, started to jam on the ivo
ries with his seat.
After a far-too-short set  only 
forty minutes  Tommy Conwell 
and the Young Rumblers left the 
stage to make way for the opening 
act, George Thorogood. Thorogood 
blasted out onto the stage and 
startedjamming with an oldDoors 
tune, Who Do You Love? He 
then went on to perform some of 
his greatest hits spanning his 13- 
year career as a recording artist.
Thorogood has received some 
criticism about the first single off 
of his new album, Boogie People. 
Called If You Dont Start Drink
ing (Im Gonna Leave), the song 
has gotten flack for its apparent 
endorsement of drinking. 
Thorogood has responded to the 
criticism by saying that, Rock cn 
roll should be socially unaccept
able.
Thorogood did, however, make 
a statement during one of his 
songs that drinking and driving 
is not cool. If youre drinking, 
dont drive. Let your buddy drive 
you home. (The crowd cheers.)
Let your girlfriend drive you 
home. (The crowd cheers again.) 
Or better yet, let your buddys 
girlfriend drive you home. (The 
crowd goes wild.)
Thorogood and his band then 
went into a fifteen to twenty 
minute jam of One bourbon, one 
scotch, one beer, one of their more 
popular songs over the years. 
Soon, the crowd started singing 
along and Thorogood stopped 
playing. He asked the crowd if 
they had heard this story before. 
The crowd shouted back with a 
big affirmative. Thorogood looked 
around at the crowd and slowly 
replied, And youre going to hear 
it again, and again, and again. 
The crowd started jumping 
around, screaming and yelling.
For his encore, Thorogood re
turned to the stage with an Ameri
can flag as his headband. He 
brought Tommy Conwell back 
onstage, where they jammed on a 
very patriotic song, Proud to be 
Living in the USA. George got 
the crowd singing on the refrain 
and everyone was going nuts. A 
45-year-old balding businessman 
to my right, who kept a rhythm 
like he kept his hair, and a fouryear-old kid sitting in front of me 
were both having the time of their 
lives.
On a lesser note, two-thirds of 
the way through the concert the 
Mosque did run out of beer. A 
couple of pissed-off people that I 
never met before thought it nec
essary to tell me this fact during 
the concert; so I feel that I must 
pass it on once again.
If this really was the destruc
tion of the Syria Mosque, I say
they should destroy it every weekAJ Palumbo Center, and Three 
end, only next time, lets get an Rivers, and every other joint 
adequate amount of beer. Hell, around here that has ever had a

Scotch N Soda plans a grand gesture for Carnival
By TERRI KASCH
Tartan Asst. Diversions Editor
There was a short period of time 
last fall when the members of 
Scotch *N Soda were worried. Al
though Carnival may have 
seemed ages away to most of us, 
they needed to start the prelimi
nary work on their show for Car
nival; the only problem was, they 
didnt have a show to work on.
Enter seniors Chris Thomas, 
Kevin Thomas (brothers), both 
English majors, and Michael 
Cuccaro, a mechanical engineer, 
after discussing the matter with 
Scotch N Soda, managed to bang 
out a reasonable story line in just 
five days.
Itwas Chrisidea to start with, 
Cuccaro states. We started it kind 
of on a whim. I told him that 
Scotch TSi Soda didnt have a show, 
so he said Want to write one? I 
said, No, and then he said, Well, 
come on, and so we talked about

it.
Collaborative writing is rarely 
easy, but the three writers man
aged to find a way to work to
gether. The first thing that we 
had to establish was the charac
ters ... so we spent a day doing 
nothing but just talking about 
what our characters were going 
to be and how to treat them. Once 
we got that out of the way, the 
actual actions that they took on 
really were less significant. What 
really helped is that my brother 
and I do think along similar lines, 
and Mike also happens to think 
along similar lines, and so we got
really lucky. It wasnt as hard as 
it might have been with a differ
ent group of people.

ten, Musical Director and sopho
more IM major Michael Walker 
and Assistant Director Mick 
Sutter, a junior English major, 
with the help of a few other stu
dents, inserted songs into the 
play. The result of all this is a 
large-scale musical called 
dArtegan: A Requiem. The plot 
centers around Sir Philip 
dArtegan who, after discovering 
that his own death is fast ap
proaching, decides to sail around

Sutter takes a more subdued approach to his job.
the world  to go out with style, 
so to speak. In order to do this, he 
must find a crew willing to go 
with him and his right-hand man 
Random, an unwilling compan
ion. dArtegan soon meets up with 
notorious pirate Morgan the Red 
and they set sail for strange 
worlds.
Senior English major Javier 
Grillo-Marxuach, the writer oflast 
years Scotch N Soda production, 
Trapped iji the Silver Screen, has 
taken on the task of direction this 
year. While Grillo-Marxuach has 
directed before, This is the first 
full-length musical Ive ever done 
and because of that Ive had to 
ask a lot of people to do things 
that I cant personally do.... We 
have two choreographers who are 
working on the show along with 
me. Their contribution to the cho
reography is much more pro
nounced than mine ... and I have 
a stage combat person; Mark 
Donnelly is doing that for me. I 
felt that if I did it myself, it would 
look as good as my skills, which 
are negligible in this respect.
The two choreographers that 
assisted Grillo-Marxuach are 
H&SS sophomore Christian 
Matyi and senior English major 
David Gross. Matyi handled about 
a third of the dancing, using what 
he had picked up in his seven 
years of theater experience.
Speaking of his dancing back
ground, he says, Ive never done 
anything professional, no profes
sional people have taught me. Its 
all second-hand knowledge. In 
the past, Matyis experience has 
centered around acting. Now in 
addition to choreographing, he is 
stage managing. The cast itself, 
they really know what theyre do
ing, so it makes my job a lot easier. 
Its a very complex show in terms 
of sets and costumes. Every set 
change is major. There are thou
sands of props, thousands, I think 
the most props of any Scotch N 
Soda production.
Since Matyi enjoys performing 
so much, he predicts that spend
ing this show behind the scenes 
will not always be easy. There 
are a lot of other things I would 
like to do on campus ... and I 
would have liked to have seen 
more of Carnival than I did last 
year. These reasons contributed 
to Matyis decision to take a back
stage job, but he adds that he still 
thinks about being onstage. Im 
sure when the show opens Ill be 
like I wish, I wish, I wish, but Im 
not going to worry about that.
Sutter shares similar feelings 
about being backstage. Last year 
he played the bewildered screen
writer Perry Arnold in Trapped 
in the Silver Scree?i\ this year

ing night. Hopefully next year 
Ill be able to direct a show. In 
Scotch N Soda you have to assis
tant direct a show before you can 
direct. Sutter intends to continue 
acting, however. I think I like 
acting better, but I still wanted to 
be able to keep the option of di
recting open.
Gross did not have to choose 
between acting and behind-thescenes work, because in addition 
to being a choreographer, he also 
has a lead role playing the myste
rious and melancholy Jon. Hes a 
very odd sort of person, Gross 
explains. In this play, for the 
first time he doesnt want to do 
what he has to do anymore. This 
character is a big change from 
Herbert East, the maniacal vil
lain Gross played last year. My 
biggest problem with Jon is being 
ultra, ultra human ... whereas 
with Herbert I just had to whip 
myself into a frenzy.
Gross was asked to choreograph' 
a few of the scenes because of the 
work he did in Greek Sing in 1990. 
I wouldnt call myself a choreog
rapher. It was more like we had 
blocking and I turned it into cho
reography.
All the people involved with this 
show had to contend with the chal
lenge of working with material 
that has never been performed 
before. CIT freshman Thomas 
Beaulieu, who plays the title role, 
says that working with an origi
nal script means You dont have 
anything to fall back on, but thats 
not always good anyway. A char
acter should be original in itself 
every time its portrayed. So, its 
hard in some ways; its a lot easier 
in others.
Matyi explains the steps he took 
to begin working on the dancing: 
I familiarize myself a lot with 
the music. Familiarize, familiar
ize, familiarize! Then I make the 
music fun. I begin to look at what
I do when Im having fun with 
music, and I make it broader. 
Grillo-Marxuach realizes that 
with so much going on during 
Carnival, students wont be able 
to see everything. If this were a 
really quiet little intimate show 
with two cast members over a 
dinner table, I think it would be 
difficult to compete with [the rest 
of Carnival]. But its a big, swash
buckling show, and I think the 
people watching it are going to be 
riveted.
The stars in the show do not 
seem to have any regrets about 
missing some of the other activi
ties going on during Carnival. 
Sophomore mechanical engineer 
Jon Walsh, who plays first-mate 
Brassatio, says, As far as Im 
concerned this show is Carnival. 
H&SS sophomore Paul Knag, who 
portrays Karthas, adds, Id much 
rather be in here onstage for two 
hours than out riding the Ferris 
wheel.

Airplane!
Remember all those really bad airplane disaster 
; movies that the local TV station shows at three in the 
morning? Well, Airplane! is one of those disaster 
movies ... sort of.
The Zucker boys and Jim Abrahams, the creators 
of Police Squad!, put together this spoof on air panic 
films complete with every joke imaginable, no matj ter how simple-minded.
Robert Hays stars as the passenger who comes 
through to fly the plane when the cabin crew be, comes ill in mid-air, and Leslie Neilsen puts in one 
of the best performances as the stereotypical doctor 
; on board. Lloyd Bridges role as the airport man
ager who has to get the plane on the ground in time 
; while losing control of his addictions is another 
highlight. Definitely worth a dollar and time out of 
; your busy carnival schedule.

The Love Bug
If your interested in seeing a movie about a luck
less buggy pusher who teams up with a possessed 
buggy as they go on to win Sweepstakes and land 
dates with hot sorority chicks, your at the wrong 
movie.
This is The Love Bug, not The Love Buggy. Substi
tute the buggy with a Volkswagen, the luckless 
pusher with an equally luckless race car driver, and 
the sorority sisters with some goofy Disney actress, 
and youve got the right show. The Love Bug is 
somehow a classic, the predecessor to all of those 
other Herbie Goes to... and Herbie Does This and 
That movies that Disney popped out with such 
fervor. There are laughs to be found in this movie, as 
the Disney comedy formulas could only ensure it.
So, if youve grown bored with the buggy races, the 
rides, the constant partying, or if youre that guywith the possessed buggy, the Sweepstakes victory, 
and the sorority girl on your arm, you might want to 
stop by and see this movie.

Three new shows assault viewers
New shows have been premier
ing all season long, and it doesnt 
seem that this onslaught of pre
mieres will stop anytime soon. I 
recently caught three of these new 
programs: Baby Talk, Top of the 
Heap, and Northern Exposure.
Baby Talk: Tuesday at 8:30 
pm, channel 4 (ABC). Ill admit 
that I have not seen Look Whos 
Talking, the film on which this 
series is based. But after seeing 
this series, I have absolutely no 
desire to see the movie.
Ostensibly, Baby Talk is about 
a single mother and her baby  
as seen through the eyes of the 
child. The catch is that we get to 
hear the babys thoughts on what 
is going on around him. Cute.idea, 
I suppose, if its done right. Un
fortunately, that is not the case 
here.
First of all, the voice of the baby 
is provided by Tony Danza. Even 
on Whos the Boss, Danza is best 
taken in small doses. Hearing his 
unique voice on two different 
shows in one week is Danza over
load. Just another reason to dis
like him.
Second, the kid cant act. 
Granted, hes probably less than 
a year old, but whenever theres a 
close-up, he looks like hes about 
to belch. Not exactly the look of an 
intelligent and witty mind.
I could go on, but I wont. There 
are justtoo many bad things about 
this show. Even star Julia Duffy, 
Stephanie on Newhart, embarTHE LAUGH TRACK
by A. Franklin Wheeler
rasses herself here, suffering 
through horrible dialogue and 
inane situations. Of course, it 
doesnt help that she has to pause 
after every line to wait for the 
baby to think.a cute thought. 
Avoid this one like the plague.
Top of the Heap: Sunday at 
9:30 pm, channel 53, (Fox). I actu^ 
ally had high hopes for this show; 
in retrospect, I wonder why. Jo
seph Bologna stars in this Mar
ried ... with Children spinoff as 
Charlie Verducci, a poor sop who 
wants to get rich quick. With the 
help of his grown son Vinnie, 
Charlie hopes to marry (or have 
his son marry) someone rich.
This is the entire premise. As 
far as I can tell, each episode 
consists of father and son butting 
in on rich peoples parties, trying 
to fit in. Supposedly, the show 
picks on the haughty rich, while 
also laughing at the pathetic lives 
of the Verduccis.
Basically, this is Married... with 
Children without any of the hu
mor. Married is a parody of count
less sweet, smarmy family shows
that have come and gone. The 
Bundys are definitely a family we 
love to hate. Finally, a TV family 
that doesnt make the viewer feel 
pathetic.
But Top. of the Heap really has 
no reason for existence. The 
Verduccis are completely 
unlikable, and the show doesnt 
seem to be a parody of anything. 
Its two sweaty, smelly guys try
ing to get hitched. Not my idea of 
entertainment.
Of course, sex, sexual innuendo, 
and sexism abound, as they do in 
Married ... with Children. But 
while in Married, we can laugh 
(maybe) at the characters rather 
than what they say, Top of the 
Heap is disgusting and offensive 
only for the shock value. It just 
doesnt make for good TV. I ex
pected something a little better 
from the Married creators.
Northern Exposure: Monday 
at 10 pm, channel 2 (CBS). Offi
cially, this isnt anew show. It ran 
for a few weeks last summer, but 
I saw it for the first time last 
week, so its new to me. Here, 
finally, is a thoroughly entertain
ing program which is a pleasure 
to watch. Northern Exposure is 
the feel-good show of*the year.
Rob Morrow stars as a doctor 
who agrees to open a practice in 
Cicely, Alaska for a few years in 
order to pay for his medical school 
education. Cicely is a small town 
where everyone knows everyone 
else. The doctor is from New York
City and doesnt exactly adore 
Cicely, but he seems to be coming 
around.
The creators of Northern Expo
sure were involved with St. Else
where, andwhilei&cposwre doesnt 
have the same intensity and real 
feel of that medical drama, the 
characters and dialogue are welldeveloped and witty. The 
townsfolk have just the right bal
ance of quirkiness, savvy, and 
down-home charm, and (of course) 
theres even a romantic interest 
for Doc in the form of local, but 
educated, Maggie.
At times, it really feels like 
youre watching a Woody Allen 
film, which has to be at least a bit 
intentional: The central charac
ter is a Jewish New Yorker placed 
in a foreign environment, sur
rounded by people he doesnt un
derstand, and loaded down with 
gobs of personal problems. Actu
ally, his kvetchings on his lack of 
a social life make for some of the 
best scenes in the show.
Cicely is a weird little town, but 
its a place most of us wouldnt 
mind visiting for a few days (no 
mass murderers or supernatural 
owls running around, as in Twin 
Peaks). With engaging characters 
and entertaining stories, North
ern Exposure should not be 
missed.

Westworld
Westworld centers around an expensive world for 
well-to-do vacationers. In this world, vacationers 
can live out their wildest fantasies in either King 
Arthurs Court or the Old West with the aid of 
programmed robots. These robots populate the fan
tasy resort and are repaired nightly by scientists so 
they can be killed the next day-by tourists. How
ever, when tourists Richard Benjamin and James 
Brolin come up against a rebellious robot (Yul 
Brynner), its a scene right out of Terminator.

Home Alone
The movie world already has enough flicks about 
irritating, precocious brats, but Home Alone has a 
unique charm that sets it apart from the horde. The 
obligatory sympathy-for-the-aged subplot wont 
make your heart stop in its tracks with poignant 
remorse, but Kevins struggles to survive while 
bungling, but nonetheless antagonistic, prowlers 
stalk his home are simply cute and whimsical be
yond belief. The theme of the movie vacillates be
tween insightful personal growth and slapstick 
mirth, but settles happily on the latter, and the 
results are across-the-board enjoyable.
Home Alone has booby traps, bold adventures, 
and the general unfettered escapist abandon we 
expect of a creative child left on his own in a highbudget comedy. What else are you going to buy with 
a dollar? Twenty pieces of Bazooka gum? Go see 
Home Alone and enjoy a wistful wave goodbye to 
your fading childhood.

Kindergarten Cop
Despite a triple prescriptionfor noxious clichehood 
(Cop Movie, Cute Little Kids Comedy, Fugitive On 
The Run Tragedy), this movie is great. The plot is 
standard police stakeout fare. Our favorite mono
lith Arnold Schwarzenegger and his partner infil
trate a small town in order to smoke out a childtoting runaway before her paternally obsessive, 
criminal ex nabs her. But when his companion falls 
ill, Arnold is forced to disguise himself as a kinder
garten teacher, and finds himself overwhelmed by a 
tsunami of hilarious developmental boisterousness.
Director Ivan Reitman really managed to pack 
every conceivable Hollywood trademark into this 
' movie. There are substantial portions of both action 
and drama, all immersed in a framework of ribtickling shenanigans. And, of course, theres Arnold. 
The storylinebeyond the worn underlyingpremise 
 is refreshing and followable, and the acting is 
surprisingly superior.
Kindergarten Cop is an all-around delight, and 
an encouraging reminder that not every Hollywood 
writer is brain-dead or pretentious. You wont miss 
your dollar.

Jungle Book
Wouldnt it be great if every piece of noteworthy 
literature were rendered in cartoon form? You could 
just sit down and watch the animated Anna 
Karenina, The Cossacks in cartoon form, Tom and 
Jerry in War and Peace. The result wouldnt be 
nearly as grand as what the Disney animators have 
done with Rudyard Kiplings The Jungle Book.
Come and see the story of Mowgli, the young 
Indian boy who strays from his village and is raised 
by a pack of wolves. As he grows, he learns valuable 
lessons from his wolf and bear mentors, and imparts 
some valuable human qualities to them as well. 
Some scholars argue that Kiplings work is nothing 
more than a childrens tale, others maintain that it 
is an allegory of colonial government. Say what you 
will, its the dancing bear thats worth watching.
