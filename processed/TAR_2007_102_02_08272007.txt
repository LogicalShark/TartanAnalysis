Campus 
gets a 
new look
by Cecilia Westbrook
Staffwriter
Summer is the season of 
construction on campus. In 
the three months between 
graduation and Orientation, 
the staff of Campus Design 
and Facilities Development 
(CDFD) was hard at work 
completing a long list of con
struction projects while the 
campus was less populated.
According to its website, 
CDFD is responsible for 
managing the construc
tion of new buildings and 
renovation of major projects 
throughout the planning, 
design, and construction 
phases. Coordinating its 
project delivery with other 
university service groups, 
CDFD constructs projects on 
behalf of the specific users 
and for the campus in gen
eral. Most of the work has to 
be done in three months of 
the year.
We have to get it all done 
while students and faculty 
are gone for the summer, 
said Ralph Horgan, associate 
vice provost of CDFD.
Students will notice that 
the front steps of Doherty 
Hall underwent major reno
vation to incorporate a new 
wheelchair ramp, and the 
track in Gesling Stadium has 
been completely replaced.
It looks just like the old 
track, but its much higher 
quality, said Bob Reppe, di
rector of design at CDFD.
Next door to the track, 
construction on the Tartans 
Pavilion is underway. The 
Pavilion will be a dining area 
featuring garage-door style 
windows that can be opened 
to convert it into an outdoor 
space. CDFD is coordinating 
with Housing and Dining on 
that project, which is slated 
for completion by Homecom
ing, in late October.
Students might also notice 
the new study rooms being 
built in both Engineering 
and Science and Hunt librar
ies. CDFD is coordinating 
construction of these rooms 
for the University Libraries. 
They are slated for comple
tion on September 6. And, 
if youre studying in Hunt 
and want to take a quick 
nap, check out the new nap 
pod that the library admin
istration has installed in the 
Maggie Murph Caf.
Although not one of 
CDFDs projects, another ma
jor project underway is the 
University Libraries reclas
sification of holds from the 
Dewey Decimal to the Library 
of Congress system in both 
Engineering and Science and 
Hunt libraries. The reclas
sification will continue into 
the fall semester, according 
to the library website, and 
students may expect to have 
some difficulty finding books 
until the process is complete.
The movement and expan
sion of Entropy, Carnegie 
Mellons convenience store, 
began just last week and 
will be completed sometime 
this semester, according to 
Horgan.
The new facility, called 
Entropy Plus, will be located 
in the old lounge next to Si 
Seor on the first floor of the 
University Center. As well 
as having 50 percent more 
space than the old Entropy, 
Entropy Plus will have new

Carnegie Mellon received 
an anonymous bomb threat 
from an undisclosed party 
via e-mail last Friday after
noon that made reference to 
Doherty Hall and the Mellon 
institute. Carnegie Mellon 
University Police with the 
Pittsburgh Bureau of Police, 
University of Pittsburgh Po
lice, and Port Authority Police 
responded to the threat by 
immediately evacuating both 
buildings and conducting a 
thorough investigation.
Among investigators were 
David Nams of the Univer
sity of Pittsburgh Police and
his black lab, Riggs, who is 
highly trained in explosive 
detection, a fellow sergeant 
said.
During this time, campus 
security personnel escorted 
evacuees two at a time back 
into the buildings to retrieve 
their belongings. The uni
versity originally planned 
to close both buildings until 
noon on Saturday, but later 
anticipated only a 30-minute 
wait before those evacuated 
would be let back inside. At 
about 4:15 p.m., the buildings 
reopened.
The university remained 
in contact with the campus 
community via AlertNow, t he 
system recent ly implemented 
to contact students (along
with faculty and staff) via 
cell phone with up-to-date 
information in t he event of an 
emergency. The first update, 
sent at 3:15 p.m., reported 
that the bomb threat had been 
received.
The second update, at about 
3:45 p.m., stated that both 
buildings had been evacu
ated. were in the process of 
being investigated, and would 
re-open in approximately 30 
minutes.
The third and final up
date at 4:15 p.m. announced 
that both buildings had been 
checked and cleared and were 
now open.
0 f fit: i a 1 Com m unications
also sent t wo e-mails, one at 
5:30 p.m. that announced the
investigation, 
and a second 
at 8 p.m. con
firming that the 
investigation was 
complete and the 
buildings had been reopened.
Those students who signed 
up for AlertNow received the 
messages; those that didnt 
were left in the dark.
Im not aware of it, at 
least, said Mamar Kumar, a 
second-year graduate student 
in chemical engineering, of 
the Alert Now system.
He stood with second-year 
Ph.D. student in chemical 
engineering, Sree Ram, who 
had also never heard of the 
system.
They were two of a crowd of
about 20, mainly graduate 
students and faculty, who 
had been evacuated from 
Doherty Hall.
The group gathered outside 
the buildings south entrance 
while a university security 
guard secured the doors.
Kumar and Ram said that 
they were informed of the 
threat when a staff member 
came to knock on t he doors of 
their offices and told them to 
exit the building. The build
ings alarm was also sounded 
to warn occupants of the 
danger.
University Police and the 
Pittsburgh Bureau of Po
lice could not be reached for 
comment.

Students contribute to citys diversity
by Sabrina Porter
Assistant News Editor
As another semester begins 
and demographics shift on 
campus, the city of Pittsburgh 
also celebrated the changing 
diversity of its residents with 
the first annual DiverseCITY symposium and festival. 
The four-day event, held Au
gust 16-19, filled the streets 
of downtown Pittsburgh with 
inspirational lecturers, soul 
guitarists, Latin rock bands, 
and Jamaican reggae stars.
The symposium, which took 
place on August 16 and 17, 
featured discussion sessions, 
networking receptions, and 
a panel of CEOs from UPMC, 
Vivisimo, GlaxoSmithKline 
Consumer Healthcare, and 
other companies.
The festival culminated in 
performances from gospel, 
blues, Latin, and Jamaican art
ists in an effort to celebrate, 
promote, and encourage di
versity throughout greater 
Pittsburgh.
The demographics of Pitts
burghs residents have shifted 
in the past few years.
In the past 10 years, the 
number of African-American 
residents has increased by 16 
percent. The number of His
panic residents has increased 
by 11 percent; however, with 
only about 12,000 such resi
dents, Hispanics make up less 
than 1 percent of the Pittsburgh population.
Comcast, one of Pittsburghs 
largest cable companies, does 
not yet offer programming in 
Spanish, which residents ar
gue is necessary to encourage 
more Hispanics to settle in 
Pittsburgh.
While demographics may be 
changing for the better, inte
gration remains key.
Id like to walk the streets 
of Pittsburgh seeing all kinds 
of people mixed up. Id like to 
hear all kinds of music at our 
clubs and lounges. That is why 
I took the initiative and cre
ated Global Beats, said Carla 
Lein-inger, a young Pittsburgh 
resident who hosts a weekly 
Brazilian Radio Hour on 
WRCT, Carnegie Mellons radio 
station, and created a website 
called arrepia.com to promote 
Brazilian culture.
Global Beats is a cultural 
dance party held the last Sat
urday of every month at AVA on 
Highland Avenue.
There has got to be a bet
ter way of working together, 
Leininger said. I see too many 
special groups out there work
ing alone.
The diversity of Carnegie 
Mellons campus community 
has had a direct effect on Pitts
burghs culture integration, 
said University President Jared 
Cohon.
I think diversity is one of 
Pittsburghs greatest chal
lenges, Cohon said. It has 
made remarkable progress in
the past 10 years and much of 
this is due our diverse student, 
faculty, and staff populations 
around the community.
Pittsburghs increased diver
sity is evident in the changing 
nature of university organiza
tions, museum exhibits, stores, 
venues, and restaurants.
A decade ago, Pittsburgh 
was a more homogeneous town 
with only a handful of Asian 
restaurants. Today, with the 
abundance of Asian-American 
students at the neighborhood 
colleges, this number has 
grown to include Malaysian, 
Chinese, Japanese, and Thai 
restaurants.
Carnaval, a new exhibit at 
the Carnegie Museum of Natu
ral History, celebrates carnival 
celebrations from all around 
the world.
Being primarily a steel city 
in the past and lacking an in
ternational airport, Pittsburgh 
is not a destination frequented 
by internationals, said Dhruv 
Mathur, junior information 
systems and business major 
and Mayur president, but is 
slowly being recognized for its 
hidden charm through the mul
titudes of students who call it 
home for at least four years of 
their lives.
In addition to Carnegie Mel
lon, Pittsburgh is also home to 
the University of Pittsburgh, 
Duquesne University, Carlow University, Robert Morris

Students from more than 100 different countries attended Carnegie Mellon 
over the 2006-2007 academic year, according to Institutional Research & 
Analysis. These demographics have affected Pittsburghs cultural offerings.

Students and faculty experience benefits of innovation
EnergyPod installed in Hunt 
Library
This summer, an EnergyPod 
was installed in Hunt Library 
across from the Maggie Murph 
caf. The pod, created by 
MetroNaps, allows for undis
turbed napping.
The pods basic design is 
spherical on the outside, but 
contains a lounging chair with 
ample space for leg resting in
side. The design allows for a 
darkened environment for the 
sleeper. The pod also contains 
speakers, but the music played 
is not heard by passersby, and 
the design effectively silences 
outside noise so the sleeper can 
have a peaceful rest.
MetroNaps was co-founded
by a Carnegie Mellon alum
nus, Arshad Chowdhury. His 
goal was to make it easier for 
workers to take naps during 
the workday. Naps are an ef
fective method of boosting 
morale and creativity, and 
they help to promote memory 
retention.
EnergyPod design from 
MetroNaps is currently in use 
by students, workers, and doc
tors worldwide.
VonAhn named one of worlds top innova 
tors under 35
Assistant computer science 
professor Luis von Ahn was re
cently named one of the top 
35 innovators under the age of 
35 by Technology Review maga
zine.
Von Ahn was selected from 
a pool of over 300 nominees to 
receive the honor. He was cho
sen for his contributions to the 
field of human computation.
A pioneer of CAPTCHA tech
nology, von Ahn has taken new 
strides with the technology. 
CAPTCHAs are used by many 
websites during registration 
to ensure that humans, not 
computers, are attempting to 
register. Yahoo!, for example,
uses CAPTCHAs to prevent 
spammers from using automated 
programs to obtain users
e-mail addresses.
CAPTCHAs show distorted 
words in a picture, and users 
must correctly decipher the 
word in order to complete reg
istrations and gain access to 
websites.
Von Ahns new project, called 
reCAPTCHAs, is attempting to 
use CAPTCHAs to help in the pro
cess of digitizing books. Lines of 
text from old books unable to be 
properly deciphered by optical 
character recognition programs 
are scanned, distorted, and used 
as CAPTCHAs.
The reCAPTCHA program 
pairs an unknown scanned 
word with a known word. 
Users must enter both of the 
words correctly in order to ac
cess the site.
Thousands of websites 
have already begun to use 
this system, and millions of 
previously undecipherable 
words in books have been 
identified.
Von Ahn is also the inventor 
of the ESP game, a multiplayer 
game used to help properly tag 
Google photos.

Students have positive 
effect on citys diversity
William Brown, biological sciences, dies at 62
l:(ci4a1 :2 I4)466n -:88tS94c
by Claire Morgenstern
News Editor
William Brown, a member 
of Carnegie Mellons depart
ment of biological sciences for 
34 years and an innovator who 
was involved with some of the 
universitys most well-known in
terdisciplinary initiatives, died 
Sunday, July 15, at UPMC Pres
byterian in Oakland. He was 62.
The cause of death was com
plications from brain surgery 
following an accident, accord
ing to an e-mail message sent 
by Richard McCullough, dean
of the Mellon College of Sci
ence, to members of the campus 
community.
Brown came to Carnegie 
Mellon in 1973 as an assistant 
professor of biological sciences. 
For the next several decades, 
he divided his time between 
teaching undergraduate courses 
like Modern Biology, mentor
ing graduate students in his lab, 
and playing key roles in the de
velopment of interdisciplinary 
initiatives like the Bachelor of 
Humanities and Arts program, 
Science and Humanities Schol
ars program, and the Master of 
Biotechnology and Management 
program.
Brown served as acting head 
of the biological sciences depart
ment from 1993 to 1995 and 
department head from 1995 to
2000. In 2004, he was awarded 
Carnegie Mellons Robert Doh
erty Award, which recognizes 
faculty members who contribute 
significantly to the development 
of educational programs.
[Brown] had an energy you 
couldnt even imagine, said Amy 
Burkert, associate department 
head for undergraduate affairs
in the department of biological 
sciences. He didnt ever see 
that there wasnt a challenge he 
couldnt take on.
Brown also extended a hand 
further beyond the classroom, 
taking a part in the departments 
murder mystery dinner, a fixture 
since 1997, and playing Santa at 
the annual Christmas party.
He was involved in what
ever we were doing, said Jared 
Wenger, who graduated in 2006 
with a degree in biological sci
ences and is currently pursuing 
a Ph.D. in genetics at Stanford 
University.
Wenger recalled how Brown 
lent students his own backyard 
so they could build the BioSAC 
booth for Carnival, a tradition 
begun in 2005. He also routinely 
took students up to his familys 
cabin in Irwin, Pa.
Former graduate student Chris
tine Wang was one of Browns 
advisees on a thesis project that 
involved using microorganisms 
in river sediment to clean up con
taminants in the water.
I think hes the best thesis 
adviser and mentor any student 
could ask for, Wang said. He
was always very supportive and 
allowed students the freedom 
and luxury to explore.
Brown spent the spring 2007 
semester as a visiting professor on 
the Qatar campus, teaching a hy
brid biology course he developed 
to integrate online multimedia 
into the traditional classroom 
lecture setting.
Prior to his accident, Brown 
had planned to return to Qatar for 
three years as special assistant to 
Chuck Thorpe, dean of Carnegie 
Mellon University in Qatar.
Bill does live on because hes 
touched so many people that 
there are no limits to the impact 
that hes going to have, Burkert 
said. Hes taught us a lot of very 
important lessons, not just about 
science, but about education and 
about dealing with people and 
being a leader and a doer.
Brown is survived by his wife, 
Linda, and sons Kevin and Eric. 
Eric is a graduate of Carnegie 
Mellons Entertainment Technol
ogy Center.
A private funeral was held in 
Browns honor on July 20 at Sixth 
Presbyterian Church in Squirrel

Campus mourns loss of ChemE professor Gary Powers
l:(ci4a1 :2 is4 ls4fF ,4oncif4Si
by Alexander Dileonardo
Staffwriter
Gary Powers, a professor of 
chemical engineering and a 
member of the Carnegie Mellon 
faculty since 1974, died of a heart 
attack on July 23 at his home in 
Sewickley, Pa. He was 61.
Powerss expertise in process 
systems engineering and safety
analysis made him a leader in the 
industry throughout his tenure 
at Carnegie Mellon. With under
graduate and graduate students 
in his lab, he created experiments 
that emphasized aspects of pro
cess safety and environmental 
risk analysis, which prompted 
many of the students to become 
entrepreneurs, according to a 
university press release issued 
July 26. Powers was also a ma
jor player in Carnegie Mellons 
Center for Advanced Process 
Decision-Making.
At the beginning of each se
mester, Powers would sit with 
Polaroid photographs of the stu
dents in his classes, trying to 
memorize each name and face, 
his daughter Becky Musial re
called in an article published by 
the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette on 
July 27. Musial added that Powers 
cherished his relationships with 
faculty and students, and that 
he encouraged students to work 
together and form relationships
with each other inside and out
side of the classroom.
Powers received a bachelors 
degree in chemical engineering 
from the University of Michigan 
in 1967. He attended the Univer
sity of Wisconsin for his Ph.D. in 
chemical engineering. Powers 
spent two years at the Massachu
setts Institute of Technology as an 
associate professor before joining 
the Carnegie Mellon faculty.
Powers was a multiple re
cipient of the Kun Li Award for 
excellence, awarded annually to 
an outstanding chemical engi
neering professor by that years 
graduating senior class. In 2005, 
he received the Walton-Miller 
Award from the American In
stitute of Chemical Engineers 
for his work in process risk as
sessment. As a Ph.D. student at 
the University of Wisconsin, in 
a joint effort with colleagues, he 
developed AIDS, a program for 
the automatic synthesis of pro
cess flow sheets using artificial
intelligence techniques. He also 
co-authored Process Synthesis, 
the first textbook in this subject.
Outside of the classroom, Pow
ers was vice president of Design 
Sciences, Inc., an engineering 
firm that provides quantitative 
risk assessment services to the 
process industries.
Powers is survived by his wife 
Susan; his children Ben, Nate, 
Alex, Katie, Libby, and Becky; 
five grandchildren; and a brother 
and sister.
A memorial service in Powerss 
honor was held on July 28 at Uni
tarian Universalist Church of the 
North Hills in Franklin Park.
A campus memorial, organized 
by the department of chemical 
engineering, will be held in the 
fall.

DIVERSITY, from A1
University, Chatham Univer
sity, and Point Park Univer
sity, all of which host students 
from different cultures and 
backgrounds.
The Diversity Advisory 
Council, started by Cohon 
in 2000, is the main policy
making body on diversity at 
Carnegie Mellon. The Council 
concluded that the university 
community has come a long 
way in diversification but that 
each strength comes with its 
weaknesses, according to the 
groups 2006 Annual Report.
The report also stated that 
over the past 10 years, the 
number of women in senior 
staff positions and board of 
trustees positions has risen 20 
and 15 percent, respectively, 
while the number of female 
students in the undergraduate 
population has increased only 
about 5 percent.
This number may be affected 
by Carnegie Mellons focus on 
the technical and scientific 
fields, areas of study not typi
cally favored by women.
Over the same 10-year 
period, the population of 
Asian-American undergradu
ate students has remained 
high at above 20 percent, 
while the Hispanic and 
African-American enrollment 
rates remain low, at about 5 
percent each.
Carnegie Mellons endow
ment may have something to 
do with this consistently low 
minority enrollment.
Its endowment of about $1 
billion is remarkably lower 
than its peer institutions. The 
University of Pittsburgh beats 
out Carnegie Mellon by $1 
billion, while schools in the 
Ivy League have endowments 
superior by upwards of $30 
billion.
No matter what we intend, 
our financial aid packages to 
these typically higher-need 
groups just cannot compare 
with some of our peer institu
tions, said Cohon.
Carnegie Mellon also rates
highly in its gay, lesbian, bisex
ual, and transgender (GLBT) 
and international populations.
The university was recently 
named one of the top 100 
schools for GLBT students by 
the Advocate Guide for LGBT 
Students. ALLIES and cmuOUT, 
two student organizations that 
promote GLBT advocacy, have 
gained a significant presence 
on campus.
Carnegie Mellons interna
tional population, about 26 
percent of the overall student 
body, has led to the develop
ment of many ethnically and 
culturally oriented groups on 
campus.
Mayur, an Indian organiza
tion, has grown to be one of the 
biggest on campus for both In
dian and non-Indian students. 
Its Diwali celebration, held 
during Spring Carnival, is one 
of many events it sponsors for 
students throughout the year.
Lookingatstudent organiza
tions as a whole, organizations 
really started to lay the foun
dation to have this year be a 
landmark in their history, said 
Adi Jain, junior electrical and 
computer engineering major 
and former Mayur president.
CMU Fusion, created last 
year, integrated ethnic and 
cultural groups and put on a 
successful two-act show last 
spring featuring a capella 
singing, African music, break 
dancing, and other talents.
Campus Idol, a univer
sity-wide talent show and 
competition, was another cul
tural showcase last spring that 
displayed the diversification 
of our campus community, 
featuring songs and dances 
from many of the different cul
tures represented at Carnegie 
Mellon.
However, Cohon insists, di
versification on campus is an 
ongoing project.
Diversity is not all about 
numbers, but rather the way 
we behave as a community, 
Cohon said. We have not yet 
reached our ideal state of di
versity. However, we are much 
closer than only 10 years ago.
Stay ahead of the curve. Create the future.

Researchers study mechanism of HIV infection
by Hanadie Yousef
Staffwriter
Carnegie Mellon biophysi
cists Stephanie Tristram-Nagle 
and John Nagle have uncovered 
details as to what allows HIV to 
infect immune T-cells.
According to an article pub
lished in Biophysical Journal, 
HIV-1 Fusion Peptide Decreases 
Bending Energy, Promotes 
Curved Fusion Intermediates, 
data from this research will aid 
in computer simulations of HIV 
infection and will help further 
drug discovery.
Enveloped viruses, which de
velop outer layers from their host 
cells, infect cells by fusing with 
the cells membranes and insert
ing their genetic contents into the 
cells, essentially turning them 
into virus-producing factories. In 
order for HIV to infect immune 
T-cells and deliver its RNA concan then undergo fusion with the 
membrane and infect it.
The Nagle lab was able to 
study the intermediate stage of 
viral infection of a hydrated lipid 
bilayer by using novel research 
techniques and data analysis.
Another method to study vi
ruses and how they infect cells is 
to look at the protein-membrane 
interaction via protein crystal
lography, said Tristram-Nagle. 
This, however, focuses on pre
fusion and post-fusion states of 
viral infection. Our lab was able 
to use a novel technique to probe 
the intermediate fusion state.
Researchers developed a 
method to validate and perform 
data analysis on the structure and 
properties of fully hydrated lipids. 
This type of analysis was critical 
in their discovery of how FP-23 in
teracts with the membrane.
It is important to determine 
the structure and interactions of 
fully hydrated, fluid-phase lipid
Nagles lab discovered a short stretch 
of the gp41 protein that decreases the 
energy needed to bend a cell membrane, 
making it easier for the HIV to infect the 
cell.
tents, it must fuse its viral enve
lope with the T-cell membrane.
More specifically, HIV lowers 
the energy barriers of T-cell mem
branes to curve the membranes 
and allow a pore to form. The 
protein gp41, which is located on 
the viral envelope, enables HIV 
to penetrate the membrane.
According to a Carnegie Mel
lon press release, the Nagle lab 
discovered that a short stretch of 
the gp41 protein, known as fusion 
peptide 23 (FP-23), decreases 
the energy needed to bend a cell 
membrane, making it easier for 
the HIV to infect the cell.
A cells lipid membrane is nor
mally highly resistant to bending. 
Researchers used diffuse X-ray 
scattering data from Cornell Uni
versitys CHESS synchrotron to 
measure the bending modulus of 
a lipid bilayer and found that FP23 causes the bending modulus 
to decrease.
According to the article in 
Biophysical Journal, a smaller 
bending modulus lessens the 
free energy barriers that must 
be overcome to pass through a 
cell membrane. The HIV particle
bilayers, because they are the un
derlying component of all plant 
and animal cell membranes, 
Tristram-Nagle said. Differ
ent lipids have different areas 
and thicknesses as well as dif
ferent material properties, and 
these differences turn out to be 
essential for membrane protein 
function. 
Researchers pioneered a 
method of data analysis that 
involves applying theory from 
liquid crystal literature to the 
lipid membrane. The shape of a 
cellular membrane, represented 
by the fluid mosaic membrane 
model, is very similar to that of a 
liquid crystal.
Our lab pioneered the use of 
liquid crystal theory to correct 
the X-ray scattering intensity col
lected from fully hydrated lipids 
and determine a structure from 
this kind of data, said TristramNagle. Without the correction, 
the X-ray data are weakened due 
to thermal undulations in fully 
hydrated lipid membranes and 
the structures are not able to

How Things Work: Holograms
Michael M. Whiston
From security emblems to magazine 
ads, holograms produce vibrant, 3- 
D images through the diffraction and 
reflection of light.
Depending on the viewers line of sight, 
holograms display different angles or col
ors of the same image, or different images 
altogether.
There are two types of holograms: re
flection and transmission holograms. A 
reflection hologram produces an image 
that can be observed in normal light, 
whereas a transmission hologram pro
duces an image that is observable only 
with laser light.
At the bare minimum, creating a ho
logram requires a laser, an object, and 
holographic film.
To create a transmission hologram, la
ser light is shined through a beam splitter
 a series of mirrors and prisms. The 
beam splitter creates two beams of light
 the object and reference beams.
The object and reference laser beams 
then each pass through a diverging lens, 
causing each beam to widen in diameter.
After passing through the diverging 
lens, the object beam reflects off a mirror 
and onto the object. Once the light meets 
the object, the intensity (amplitude) of 
the object beam changes because some of 
the light is absorbed by the object.
The object beams angle of reflection 
off the object is the same as the angle at 
which it first encountered the object. Be
cause the objects surface is not perfectly 
smooth, the light is reflected in many dif
ferent directions.
Unlike the object beam, the reference 
beam does not reflect off the object. 
Rather, it travels directly from the diverg
ing lens to the holographic film.
Once the object and reference beams 
reach the film, they interfere with one
another. Interference is the combination 
of laser beams that results in a new light 
pattern. Depending on how closely their 
wave structures overlap, the light can be 
amplified (constructive interference) or 
de-amplified (destructive interference).
Holographic film is coated with a mix
ture of silver halide. Once the object and 
reference beams reach the film, this mix
ture preserves the phase and amplitude 
differences between the reference and 
object light beams.
The final step in the creation process 
is development. During development, 
higher-intensity regions of light show
up darker in the hologram, while lowerintensity regions of light appear lighter. 
These differences in light value are 
called interference fringes. Different am
plitudes of light create different levels of 
contrast between these regions.
After development, the hologram is 
usually bleached to make it transparent, 
and then it is ready to be viewed. When 
viewed correctly, the hologram produces 
a virtual image of the object.
To view a transmission hologram, a la
ser beam is first shined through the front 
of the hologram, where the interference 
fringes are located. Some of this light
simply passes through the hologram un
altered, while other light reflects off the 
film or diffracts through slits.
This process of reflection and diffrac
tion produces a light pattern with the 
same properties as the object beam (be
fore it merged with the reference beam). 
This light beam forms a virtual image of 
the object that is located in back of the 
hologram but in front of the viewer.
The hologram can then be embossed 
by transferring the interference pattern 
onto plastic and shiny foil. Embossed ho
lograms are commonly seen in ads or on 
credit cards.
Besides being used as eye-catching 
decorations, holograms have a number of 
practical applications.
In the medical field, experts have com
bined holography with various medical 
instruments to produce high-resolution 
pictures of the body.
X-rays, for instance, can be used to take 
pictures of body parts. An X-ray laser is 
shot at an X-ray mirror, which is specially 
made with silicon and molybdenum to re
flect the laser beam. The sample is then 
hit by the laser beam, thereby creating 
the object beam.
Endoscopic holography is used for a 
similar purpose: to take pictures of cavi
ties within body organs. An endoscope is 
a device that uses light to see the inside of 
body organs. The pictures are high-reso
lution and require no contact with the 
body organs.
Holograms are also used as security 
emblems. In particular, they are placed 
on CDs, software, and expensive clothing 
to validate their legitimacy.
If you want to experience holography 
first-hand, you can purchase a Litiholo 
Hologram kit from Liti Holographies and 
try it yourself (www.litiholo.com). The kit 
includes a laser, an object, and film, and 
the creation process takes only minutes.

VR induces out-ofbody experiences
Scientists are now able to in
duce out-of-body experiences 
through the use of virtual real
ity equipment, according to a 
new study published in the Au
gust 24 edition of Science.
The feeling of belonging to a 
body is linked to multiple sen
sory streams. Under normal 
circumstances, these streams 
function harmoniously.
Sometimes these sensory 
streams report conflicting in
formation. In these situations, 
the brain is forced to make a 
decision, which may result in an 
out-of-body experience.
In one experiment, subjects 
viewed projections of their own 
bodies through virtual-reality 
goggles. The scientists stroked 
the subjects backs with sticks, 
so the subjects felt their own 
backs being stroked while also 
watching a stick stroke the pro
jection before them. Subjects 
reported feeling as if they were 
drifting out of their bodies and 
into the projected bodies.

Martian soil may 
have supported life
German scientist Joop Houtkooper found evidence of life on 
Mars through the analysis of soil 
brought back from the planet in 
1976.
Signs in the soil indicate that 
the subfreezing Martian climate 
may have once supported mi
crobial life (microorganisms) 
made of hydrogen peroxide and 
water. One experiment showed 
that 0.1 percent of Martian soil 
may be composed of former mi
croorganisms.
Houtkooper said that 0.1 per
cent is not a small amount, 
and the percentage is similar 
to the biomass percentages in 
some Antarctic permafrost.
Houtkoopers conclusions 
support the theory Earth may 
have seeded life on Mars, or 
vice versa, when an event such 
as a meteor crash transported 
life between the planets.

ing data was used to calculate 
the bending modulus of the 
membrane and validate its sig
nificance.
The preparation of the hy
drated lipid samples, known 
as the rock-and-roll procedure, 
was also pioneered by Tristram-Nagle. It involves putting 
hydrated lipids  which are 
similar to those found in a cell 
membrane  on silicon wafers, 
using them, and then hydrating 
them in a humidity chamber.
Researchers from the Nagle 
lab said that they will continue to 
work on how HIV proteins affect 
the cell membrane. Currently, 
they are studying the pretrans
membrane section of the gp41 
protein, an important cholesterol 
recognition site. The HIV mem
brane is 80 percent cholesterol, 
which Tristram-Nagle hypoth
esizes could be important if the 
cholesterol is involved in the 
change of gp41 during HIV in

Its summertime, and for 
many people with allergies, that 
means an itchy nose, watery 
eyes, sneezing, and congestion 
that arent problems during 
other seasons.
An allergy is an abnormal 
immune system response to a 
substance that would other
wise be harmless to the body. 
People can be allergic to almost 
anything to which the body is 
exposed, from food and medi
cations to pets and household 
chemicals.
Hay fever, or seasonal rhinitis, 
is one of the most common sea
sonal allergies.
Hayfeverisanallergicresponse 
to pollen particles in the air. Part 
of the reason that people with 
hay fever experience watery 
eyes and sneezing during the 
summer is that pollen is more 
common in the summer air.
Ragweed pollen, for instance, 
can be found in air samples 2 
miles out to sea and 400 feet 
high in the air, according to the 
National Institute of Allergy and 
Infectious Diseases (NIAID).
Also, people can be allergic to 
many different kinds of pollen, 
which is why some people suf
fer seasonal rhinitis at different 
times of year.
The allergic response occurs 
when the bodys immune system 
accidentally interprets a harm
less substance as a threat to the 
body. It begins when B cells in 
the bodys immune system en
counter a particular substance 
and respond by creating anti
bodies against that substance.
Antibodies are large, Yshaped proteins that can fight 
infection by recognizing a cer
tain foreign molecule, similarly
to how a lock fits into a key. Once 
antibodies have been formed for 
a molecule  now called an an
tigen  the body can recognize 
that molecule forever. Antigens 
that cause allergic responses are 
called allergens.
The antibodies produced by 
the B cells move through the 
blood stream and attach to the 
surface of two kinds of immune 
cells: mast cells and basophils. 
Mast cells are found in connec
tive tissue all over the body, and 
basophils circulate in the blood 
stream.
Both types of cells play an 
important role in the inflam
matory response, which is one 
of the ways the body protects it
self against invading pathogens 
and foreign molecules. Unfortu
nately, this response can also be 
triggered during an allergic re
action to a harmless substance.
Mast cells and basophils 
contain pockets of immunemediating chemicals, such 
as histamine, that act in the 
body to produce an inflam
matory response. As soon as 
the antibodies on these cells 
recognize the antigen, the cells 
release these chemicals into the 
blood stream and surrounding 
tissue.
Once released, these chemi
cals cause a persons allergic 
response, which typically in
cludes a runny nose, itchy eyes 
and throat, and congestion. Al
lergic responses can also include 
hives (itchy red bumps or welts) 
on the skin, nausea, and vomit
ing (in food allergies).
In some people, certain 
antigens can cause severe 
systemic reactions, includ
ing swelling of appendages, 
sudden drops in blood pres
sure, and constriction of 
the airways. This allergic 
condition is called anaphy
laxis, or anaphylactic shock. 
Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening condition and requires 
immediate medical attention.
There are a number of treat
ments for allergies. Avoiding the 
allergen is always the best way 
to prevent a reaction, but avoid
ance is not always possible.
In the case of mild reac
tions, such as hay fever, 
an antihistamine can be 
taken. Antihistamines block 
histamines ability to cause un
pleasant symptoms of allergies.
Over-the-counter antihista
mines such as Benadryl can be 
taken for short-term allergies, 
such as mosquito bites, but they 
should not be taken long-term 
because they can cause drowsi
ness.
Prescription antihistamines 
such as Claritin and Allegra, 
on the other hand, dont cause 
drowsiness and can be taken 
for longer time periods.
In addition, people with 
severe allergies may ben
efit from immunotherapy. 
Immunotherapy consists of a 
series of allergy shots con
taining dilute concentra
tions of the allergen, 
given over a period 
of time from a 
few months to a 
few years. This 
treatment
desensitizes the body and can 
cause allergy symptoms to de
crease or even disappear.
Incidence of allergic reaction 
has been increasing all over the 
world. The American Academy 
of Allergy, Asthma & Immu
nology estimates that 40 to 50 
million Americans have aller
gies of some form.
Of particular concern tothe 
health care community has been 
the steady rise of food allergies, 
which can be life-threatening. 
According to a 2006 article in 
the Journal of the European Mo
lecular Biology Consortium, the 
number of hospital admissions 
for food allergies has increased 
500 percent in the U.K. since 
1990.
The rise in food allergies 
seems to be due in part to greater 
use of certain kinds of allergyinducing foods. This is exempli
fied by increasing use of peanuts 
by the food industry, which has 
been correlated with increasing 
allergy rates.
On the other hand, according 
to a 2006 article in The Boston 
Globe, a recent study found that 
peanut allergies are much less 
prevalent in countries where 
children are fed a diet heavy 
in peanuts. This indicates that 
feeding children peanuts may 
actually protect them from de
veloping an allergy to them.
In fact, early exposure to 
an environmental toxin may 
be a protective factor in many 
kinds of allergies. For example, 
according to a recent NIAIDfunded research study, children 
who are exposed to household 
pets in the first years of life are 
much less likely to develop aller
gies of all kinds.
There are multiple factors 
that may be involved in the 
lset of allergies. Ac
cording to the National 
Jewish Medical and 
Research Center,

allergy likely in

environmental, 
and immune sys
tem factors.

Student IDs are a free pass to Pittsburgh culture
The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette recently 
reported that the Carnegie Museum of 
Natural History will raise prices of ad
mission upward of 80 percent when it 
opens its new dinosaur exhibit, Dino
saurs in Their Time, this November.
This price increase means visitors will 
have to shell out an additional five bucks 
to see the exhibit, touted as the worlds 
third-largest collection of dinosaur 
bones in new, more accurate, poses.
But dont pull out your wallets just 
yet, Carnegie Mellon students. A simple 
swipe of your university ID card will 
grant you free access to the collection, 
along with various other cultural sites.
But all of that means nothing, un
less you take advantage of the free 
opportunities. Students should use their 
ID cards for more than just bus rides to 
Squirrel Hill and Plaid Ca$h.
If you think you cant take time from 
a rigorous academic schedule, take into 
account that visiting these places is as 
much of an educational experience as 
any lecture. Phipps Conservatory, the 
Mattress Factory, Carnegie Museum of 
Art  all for zilch, zero, zip dollars.
Gallery crawls are held at least once 
each season, where students and the 
general public can hop from gallery to 
gallery downtown  all for the conve
nient price of zero dollars. Not bad for an 
all-evening event; you may be surprised 
at the number of art galleries located 
downtown. All it takes is a quick hop on 
a downtown-headed bus (free with your 
ID, of course).
For anyone who thought Pittsburgh 
was just a smog-filled city where the 
decomposing skeletons of steel mills 
loom in the skyline, think again. While 
the mills may be as aged as the dinosaur 
fossils in the Carnegie, Pittsburgh has a 
vibrant array of cultural activities, all, 
at your fingertips. And, at the risk of 
repeating ourselves, its just a swipe of 
your ID away. Take advantage of it.
Emergency Alert serves campus responsibly
In the last few years, the United 
States has been rocked by a number of 
enormous tragedies. Of these tragedies
 especially Katrina and the Virginia 
Tech massacre  many deaths and inju
ries could have been prevented through 
better communication.
Just days after 32 people were killed 
at Virginia Tech, the safety of our own 
students was virtually ignored when a 
bomb scare on campus property went 
unannounced to the students.
Given that our university is as vul
nerable to serious incident as any other 
university, we are glad the administra
tion has considered the events like the 
massacre in Virginia, and acted on them. 
Seven days before the findings of the 
first official internal report on the shoot
ings at Tech, the Carnegie Mellon Emer
gency Alert service was announced.
A voluntary program, the Emergency 
Alert sends an automated voice mes
sage to a valid phone number of your 
choice in the case of urgent news or an 
emergency situation. Using cell phones 
to communicate important news to 
students is popular: the University of 
Pittsburgh, Duquesne, Slippery Rock, 
and Indiana University of Pennsylvania
 all Pittsburghor greater-Pittsburgharea schools  have enacted similar 
methods of emergency contact, and over 
3400 Carnegie Mellon students have al
ready signed up for the program.
Other preventative actions taken on 
campuses include an instant lockdown 
of all buildings, which is not on Carnegie 
Mellons agenda. While some may hope 
for more conservative measures, were 
glad to have the assurance of protection 
without the big brother feeling.
The universitys emergency plan has 
been in place for a few years, but Emer
gency Alert is the first part of the system 
to actively alert students, instead of just 
faculty and staff. Its hard to believe 
that students  who are the university
 were left out of the plan for so long, 
and sad that it took an event like the Virgina Tech massacre to spark change, but 
great that the university was both quick 
to learn from it and quick to invoke the 
appropriate change; perhaps even better 
is that so many students see the value in 
the program. The system also seems to 
be working well  students who signed 
up for the program were alerted of the 
bomb threat on Doherty Hall and Mel
lon Institute this past Friday.
We encourage everyone to partici
pate; visit my.cmu.edu/site/main/page. 
alert.
If you build it, will they come?
With last years football team unde
feated in regular season play and the 
mens soccer bringing home the ECAC 
South Championship, we can be sure 
that the lack of attendance at campus 
sporting events has little to do with team 
performance. Now that we have won 
the battle against other college sports 
teams, we have to start fighting the 
battle here at home against ingrained 
routines and general disinterest.
Housing and Dinings answer to this 
epic problem is the Tartans Pavilion, a 
new dining facility located between the 
Gesling Stadium and West Wing and 
Resnick residence halls. The Pavilion 
will include a wood-fired pizza oven,
big screen TVs, and glass garage doors - 
a sort of California Pizza Kitchen meets 
ESPN Zone meets Coffee Tree Roasters.
Now, simply putting a restaurant next 
to the football field is not going to be a 
hard and fast solution to our ongoing 
struggle with apathy. As the old adage 
goes, you can lead a horse to wood-fired 
pizza, but you cant make him take pride 
in the football team. What the new facil
ity has the potential to do, however, is 
fill in the most basic piece of the puzzle: 
getting more students in the stadium 
during games.
The biggest hurdle is convincing 
students who would not normally be 
anywhere near Gesling on a Friday night
that its a fun, active, and worthwhile 
place to be. Hopefully, the Pavilion will 
craft a routine around getting food, 
watching sports, and having fun.
If taking the time to sit in the stands 
and watch a game is unappealing or 
just too unfamiliar, perhaps watching 
the game while also eating dinner and 
catching up on some reading will feel 
more like good old Carnegie Mellon 
multitasking. Once the routine has de
veloped, we might find we have some 
real grassroots interest in Carnegie Mel
lon sports on our hands. Maybe then we 
can give Notre Dame a call and tell them 
were ready to reopen that vintage, 1938 
can ofwhoop-ass.

State law allows students to be 
paid less than minimum wage
Jessica Thurston
Minimum wage. Its the dreaded topic 
that makes employers toes curl, employ
ees tempers flare, and labor bureaus 
payrolls soar. We all want to avoid the 
idea of the dreaded minimum wage: 
Employees want to avoid being paid the 
least amount possible under law; em
ployers want to avoid dealing with said 
low-paid, disgruntled employees. But 
what does it say when employees are 
paid lower than low  below minimum 
wage?
In Pennsylvania, according to the 
Bureau of Labor Law Compliances Min
imum Wage Law Summary, employees 
can legally be paid below minimum 
wage. Well, not just any employees: 
This exception to the law applies spe
cifically to employees-in-training, 
employees that work somewhere where 
there are 10 or less full-time workers, 
and  thats right  high school and 
college students.
The employees-in-training rule 
specifies that the employee-in-training 
can be paid $5.85 as long as they are un
der 20 years of age, and only for the first 
60 days of employment. One problem 
with this rule, however, is that there 
seems to be no way to check if an em
ployer is actually training an employee 
for these first 60 days, or whether he or 
she is just taking advantage of this ex
ception to the law.
weekly activist meetings, and daily 
track practices, all the while putting 
himself through school, what happens 
when he can only find work at a sand
wich shop, and gets paid below mini
mum wage?
The absurdity of this rule makes it 
necessary to point out several of its 
obvious counterarguments. First, high 
school and college students, particu
larly the latter, tend to be smarter and 
more efficient at tasks associated with 
retail or eatery work than are most 
other workers. I realize that an obvious 
counterargument to this assertion is 
that students should be working some
where where their skills may be bet
ter utilized, such as secretarial work. 
The problem with this idea is that most 
students do not have options outside 
of more labor-intensive work, such as 
retail shops or eateries, due to other (of
ten education-related) time constraints. 
Students cant work nine-to-five jobs be
cause of classes and other educational 
commitments.
After  acknowledging these coun
terarguments, it seems like the law 
allowing students to be paid below 
minimum wage is nothing more than a 
way for the state to please employers by 
allowing them to cut costs. As much as 
it is important for there to be a healthy 
relationship between the state and its 
businesses, what about maintaining a 
healthy relationship between the state 
and employees?
Where does employee satisfaction 
factor in to the minimum wage law? 
If employees are told that they are not
If employees are told that they are not 
worth even minimum wage, why should 
they stay faithful to the company?
The 10-or-less rule also seems 
convoluted. Are employers allowed to 
pay their employees below minimum 
wage if there are 10 or less full-time 
workers at the venue because the com
pany is then, in theory, unable to make 
as great a profit as a larger venue? On 
the flip side of this exception, if there 
are fewer workers, couldnt an employer 
pay them more money rather than less 
money?
What is truly vile about these 
exceptions to the Pennsylvania state 
minimum wage law is the fact that high 
school and college students  who 
typically work minimum wage jobs
 can legally be paid only 85 percent 
of the minimum wage. That is, students 
can legally be paid about $6.08, which 
is $1.07 less than minimum wage. 
Why is it legitimate for hard-working 
students, who are often taking on a job 
in addition to a full-time education, to 
be cheated out of an entire one-seventh 
of their deserved hourly rates?
Allowing employers to pay college 
and high school students 85 percent of 
the set minimum wage essentially just 
allows the minimum wage to be lowered 
overall. While Pennsylvania should be 
commended for raising minimum wage 
to $7.15 this past July, enforcing this ex
ception to that law seems to be taking a 
giant step backwards.
This exception assumes that high 
school and college students are not 
financially independent and are not 
supporting themselves. While being 
financially independent is probably 
less likely for high school than college 
students, many college students take 
out loans in their names to pay tuition, 
rent and living expenses, or split other 
college costs with their parents. When 
a sophomore political science major 
is busy balancing a full course load,
worth even minimum wage, why should 
they stay faithful to the company? One 
worker at Camilles Sidewalk Caf fran
chise, at the corner of Fifth Avenue 
and South Craig Street, echoed the ru
mors that the newly opened venue has 
a high turnover rate of employees due 
to low wages. Ive only been working 
here three days and Ive heard a lot of 
stories already, said a junior at the Uni
versity of Pittsburgh, explaining that 
. several workers had quit after being 
paid less than $7 an hour. While this 
is allowed according to the minimum 
wage law exceptions, is it ethical? A 
representative from the Starbucks Cus
tomer Relations regional office, when 
asked if any of the stores branches 
pay below minimum wage, responded 
with a firm Absolutely not, explain
ing that the company always pays at or 
above minimum wage as part of their 
competitive compensation package. 
While I know that this situation is not 
wholly comparable to a franchise store 
like Camilles, the moral is: Starbucks 
knows that low-paid employees will go 
elsewhere, and will give the company 
a bad reputation  which Camilles is 
rapidly acquiring.
So the moral of the story is just that: 
maintaining morals. Despite it being 
legal to pay below minimum wage, do
ing so is indecent, particularly to col
lege students. Instead, students should 
be paid at or above minimum wage to 
increase productivity and employee 
morale, and, most importantly, to be 
able to support themselves and their 
lifestyles.

Carnegie Mellon makes the switch to cage-free eggs for on-campus meals
Michael Croland
Conditions for egg-laying chick
ens and other animals raised in 
factory farms are hardly reminis
cent of Old MacDonalds Farm. 
Factory-farmed animals are typi
cally confined to tiny spaces in 
unnatural conditions and sub
jected to the mutilation of their 
body parts without any painkill
ers. While anyone who purchases 
animal products that come from 
such industrialized farms should 
explore more humane eating op
tions, Carnegie Mellons Dining 
Services should be commended 
for switching to cage-free eggs.
Beginning this semester, Dining 
is using eggs that dont come 
from caged chickens. Only cagefree eggs will be used for both 
liquid and shell eggs. The move
follows the lead of more than 150 
other colleges and universities in 
the last few years, including Case 
Western, Tufts, Georgetown, 
Dartmouth, and Harvard. Super
market chains Whole Foods and 
Wild Oats only sell cage-free eggs, 
and some major companies  in
cluding Burger King and Ben & 
Jerrysare working to phase out 
their use of eggs from chickens in 
battery cages.
About 95 percent of egg-lay
ing chickens in this country are 
confined to battery cages, which 
are stacked on top of each other 
so that excrement from the birds 
on top falls on the animals below. 
Hundreds of thousands of birds 
may live in one huge, putrid shed. 
Birds in battery cages are not 
able to nest, dust-bathe, or carry 
out any other natural behaviors. 
Instead, between five and 11 
chickens are stuffed inside cages 
so tiny that a sole bird wouldnt
be able to spread her wings, even 
if she were alone. Battery cages 
have been banned in numer
ous European countries and will 
be phased out in the European 
Union by 2012.
As cruel as battery cages are, 
the egg industry has other dirty 
secrets too. Baby chicks typically 
have their sensitive beaks seared 
off so that they wont peck each 
other to death under stressful 
conditions. Chickens are often 
starved for a period of seven to 14 
days in order to induce an extra 
egg-laying cycle. These practices 
arent humane, but for birds, it is 
better to be subjected to them and 
not live in battery cages than en
dure all of the above.
It takes a chicken living in 
battery cage conditions about 24 
hours to produce just one egg. Su
permarket eggs cost about a dime 
each, stated author Erik Marcus 
in his book Vegan: The New Eth
ics of Eating. There is no scale 
with which to compare 24 hours 
of animal suffering and 10 cents 
... other than the scale of human 
conscience.
Its up to individuals to ques
tion whether its worth 24 hours 
of all that suffering just for a sin
gle egg. At an institutional level, 
since Dining Services isnt about 
to stop using eggs, its wonderful 
that Carnegie Mellon and many 
other schools and companies are 
saying No! to battery cages.
Dinings decision to switch to 
cage-free eggs didnt come out 
of left field. Students and activ
ists have urged Dining to switch 
to cage-free eggs for about four 
years. An organization named 
Student Animal Liberation Ac
tivists (SALA) formed in 2003 
to persuade Dining to work with 
suppliers that adhere to an animal 
welfare auditing program, with a 
primary focus on the conditions
of egg-laying chickens. SALA 
disbanded when its founding 
president, Eric Jonas, left Carn
egie Mellon in 2004. Sustainable 
Studentss efforts to promote 
local, organic, and humanely 
produced food have included a 
partial focus on eggs as well.
It is encouraging to see Carn
egie Mellon take this crucial, 
compassionate step toward rec
ognizing that animals deserve 
our respect and consideration, 
says Jonas. While the best way 
to help animals is to stop sup
porting the egg industry, which 
egregiously abuses animals in so 
many ways, it is comforting to 
know that Carnegie Mellon has at 
least stopped supporting one of 
the myriad abuses facing farmed 
animals.
Its important to consider the 
origins of food before it winds up 
on our plates. Production stan
dards that dont live up to ones
own values of animal welfare and 
other issues simply should not be 
supported. Carnegie Mellon stu
dents, faculty, and staff can rest 
easy knowing that their campus 
egg consumption doesnt contrib
ute to the worst animal abuse. 
Nevertheless, this news should 
serve as a wake-up call about con
suming animal products.
The best way to stop supporting 
cruelty to animals raised for food 
is by not consuming animal prod
ucts. Thanks to Dinings other 
innovations this semesternew 
vegetarian and vegan options at 
Skibo and an all-vegetarian eat
ery called Evgefstos  eating 
healthy and humane plant-based 
foods at Carnegie Mellon has 
never been easier.

Locked in the bedroom: Miscommimication with Housing and Dining
_______Rachael Clemmons
Usually, I find it unnecessary 
to launch complaints against the 
system  the system that pro
vides my housing while I attempt 
an education that will hopefully 
launch a successful career (which 
will, in turn, pay off my student 
loans for housing and education). 
However, launching complaints 
against the system became nec
essary after I had to climb out 
my bedroom window in order to 
leave my room.
My awkward encounter with 
the construction men who won
dered which window I had 
climbed from wasnt the first 
issue I have had with Housing 
and Dining Services. Not that 
there have been many  they 
employ me, which I greatly 
appreciate. Still, the first major 
problem occurred last semester 
with a representative of Housing 
services. He shall remain name
less, yet it is important to know 
that his job was to settle issues 
within the dormitory: in my 
case, a quickly intensifying feud 
between my roommate and I. 
Instead he exacerbated the prob
lems, and my general cynicism, 
when he decided to scream and 
yell at me. Although his level 
of disrespect intrigued me, as I 
was convinced he wanted me to 
report his behavior to a higher 
authority, I decided to let the 
situation be, since finals and the 
like were quickly approaching.
Since my second negative expe
rience with Housing was much 
more tragic, Ive decided to take 
action.
On August 14, 2007, I was 
locked into my room. My door 
was jammed and I was unable 
to get out. Despite the fact that 
my bladder was bursting, and my 
nose was bleeding, I didnt get 
out of my room until 11:30 a.m.
 when I decided to take action 
and climb out of my window that 
might serve as a fire escape. This
 \ *
course of action was necessary 
even though I called University 
Police at 9:30 a.m., and Housing 
at 9:45 a.m., and they had both 
assured me that they were on 
their way.
Well, University Police didnt 
exactly manage to break down my 
door, because they never showed 
up. I had called Housing twice  
the first time to introduce them 
to my unlikely problem, and the 
second time to introduce them to 
the necessity of immediate action 
to resolve my unlikely problem. I 
was assured the first time that a
representative from maintenance 
was on his or her way, and the 
second time that the representa
tive had already left and would 
be arriving any minute. I am still 
waiting for that representative, 
two weeks later.
Naturally, I was frustrated. If 
Housing were free, I wouldnt 
feel the need to complain. Since 
Housing isnt free, I personally 
dont think that maintaining 
doors is too much to ask.
Well, the staff at Housing 
noticed I was irritated with the 
situation, and furthermore, that I
phone, and me standing in front 
of her, I found it suspicious that 
she couldnt ask him which door. 
Thus, I was led to believe, since 
my question was never answered, 
that if he did come, he came to 
the front door. And that would 
be another instance of a lack of 
communication. When I called 
Housing, I relayed that I lived in 
Margaret Morrison Apartments, 
and that I was stuck inside of 
my bedroom. My message may 
have been lost in translation, 
because the only door he could 
feasibly have knocked on without 
me hearing would have been the 
front door. And, surely, I wouldnt 
have been able to open the front 
door when I was stuck inside of 
my bedroom.
Despite the questions I asked,
I received no answers or reas
surance that I wouldnt be stuck 
inside of my room again. The 
mystery maintenance man prom
ised to come to my apartment 
later that day to fix the door. I 
assume that he eventually made 
an appearance, because my door 
isnt stuck anymore.
I dont blame the individu
als that work for Housing, but 
instead the system, or lack 
thereof, for relaying messages. 
Housing should learn to com
municate better with students, 
the college, and within its own 
departments. The campus com
munity, as a whole, should 
emphasize the significance of 
communication. Housing must 
not have cared that I was stuck in 
my apartment, nor did University 
Police  that much is clear by 
the responses I didnt receive. 
Their lackluster efforts make me 
wonder what other messages are 
lost or jumbled along the way to 
students and back.
The most tragic part? Well, 
there was my recycling bin, and 
the fact that my bladder was no 
longer pulsating by the time I 
scrambled out.

SPORTS COMMENTARY
MLB outcome predicted
Sam Kim
With only a month left in 
Major League Baseballs regu
lar season, the playoff buzz 
has begun, and while the di
vision and wildcard races are 
still very crowded, I am here 
to offer my bold predictions as 
to who will make the cut when 
October arrives.
In the American League East, 
the Red Sox will hold off the 
surging Yankees to win their 
first division title since 1995. 
The Red Sox have the best rota
tion and bullpen in the division 
with an American League-best 
ERA of 3.73 as of Sunday. Ace 
Josh Beckett and veteran Tim 
Wakefield lead the American 
League with 16 wins.
The recent addition of Eric 
Gagne has temporarily hurt the 
Red Sox bullpen, but closer Jon
athan Papelbon and setup man 
Hideki Okajima strengthen the 
very deep bullpen.
The Yankees may not win the 
division, but they will make the 
postseason once again as the 
wildcard team. The recent ad
dition of pitching prospect Joba 
Chamberlain has stabilized a 
shaky bullpen this year, and 
the Yankees are nearly first in 
every offensive category in the 
league, including batting av
erage, home runs, RBIs, runs, 
and hits.
In the AL Central, the Detroit 
Tigers currently trail the Cleve
land Indians, but they will still 
win the division with their 
strong offense and improving 
bullpen. Led by MVP candidate 
Magglio Ordonez, the Tigers 
have the second-best offense 
only behind the Yankees. The 
return of flamethrower Joel Zumaya from the disabled list will 
stabilize what was considered 
the best preseason bullpen. 
The Indians possess two poten
tial Cy Young winners, Fausto 
Carmona and C.C. Sabathia, 
but their offense continues 
to struggle. Their offense has 
scored three runs or fewer in 
nearly 50 games this season. 
If the Indians do not start scor
ing, they will be out of playoff 
contention soon.
The Seattle Mariners will 
surprise the Los Angeles Angels 
of Anaheim to win the AL West. 
The Angels failure to make a 
big trade-deadline move for a 
hitter will hurt them consider
ably. Especially with the loss 
of Juan Rivera, the Angels 
do not have much protection 
for cleanup hitter Vladimir 
Guerrero. Garret Anderson 
continues to put up mediocre 
numbers while catching com
bination Jeff Mathis and Ryan 
Budde has barely hit .200 in 
the bottom of the lineup.
In addition to their strong 
offense, the Mariners are one
of the best teams in one-run 
games, going 21-17. Their 
bullpen, among the best in the 
league, will finally help bring 
them back to the playoffs.
Even with all their rotation 
struggles, the New York Mets 
continue to lead the National 
League East. With Jose Reyes 
and Castillo at the top of the 
lineup, the Mets offense can 
attack and score early in any 
game. Starting pitchers John 
Maine and Orlando Hernandez 
continue to pitch well, and the 
return of ace Pedro Martinez 
may be the biggest acquisition 
down the stretch.
The Mets will win this di
vision, but the Philadelphia 
Phillies will finally make the 
playoffs by winning a crowded 
wildcard race. Even after the 
injury troubles, the Phillies are 
only a game behind in the wild
card race. Their NL-best offense 
will be further strengthened by 
the return of Chase Utley, who 
was on the disabled list with a 
broken hand.
The NL Central is the weak
est division in baseball but 
perhaps the most exciting one. 
The defending champions, the 
St. Louis Cardinals, got off to a 
brutal start, but they are sud
denly only a few games behind 
the Milwaukee Brewers and 
Chicago Cubs. Although the 
Cubs have a potent lineup, the 
Brewers will edge out to win 
the division.
The Brewers have arguably 
the best closer, Francisco Cor
dero, in the division and are 
expecting the return of ace Ben 
Sheets. With Chris Capuano 
struggling without a win since 
May 5, Sheets may be the de
ciding factor in an extremely 
tight race.
Led by NL home run leader 
Prince Fielder and potential 
rookie of the year Ryan Bruan, 
the Brew Crew is fighting for 
more than the division title; it 
is fighting for its first playoff 
appearance since 1982.
Without a doubt, the Arizona 
Diamondbacks are the best in 
the West. The Dbacks have 
the best record in the National 
League since the All-Star break. 
Last years Cy Young winner, 
Brandon Webb, continues to 
be unstoppable of late with 42 
straight scoreless innings for 
the Dbacks. Although the Pa
dres have playoff experience, 
the Dbacks have played well 
against them head-to-head, go
ing 7-4.
At least 15 teams have a shot 
at making the playoffs this 
year, but I predict that solid 
pitching will lead both the Red 
Sox and Diamondbacks to the 
World Series. In the end, the 
Red Sox come out on top and 
win the World Series in five 
games, with home field advan
tage at Fenway Park.

Ongoing 
changes to 
athletics
by Doug Fricker
Senior Sports Staff
As another spores season be
gins at Carnegie Mellon, students 
will notice many changes in Tar
tan athletics. Over the spring and 
summer, Athletics Director Susan 
Bassett initiated these changes in 
an attempt to continue and en
hance the Tartans successes.
These changes include up
grades to the sites of these 
athletic competitions as well as 
fresh faces within the athletics 
department.
Last summers major changes 
within athletics were FieldTurf 
on Gesling Stadium and a var
sity athletic weight room. The 
Carnegie Mellon football team 
has never lost playing on the 
new silica sand and cryogenic 
rubber FieldTurf; going 6-0 in 
2006. More changes occurred 
this summer and the results are 
impressive.
The old track was taken out 
and resurfaced, and a new score
board sits nicely where the old 
scoreboard once was. The IM 
fields continue to be upgraded, 
and a Tartans Pavilion is being 
constructed on the southern edge 
of the stadium.
The Tartans Pavilion will be a 
4100 square foot, glass-enclosed 
eatery, which will open up to
ward the turf. When the pavilion 
is completed this fall, students 
will be able to sit and eat pizza 
while watching a football game.
Skibo Gymnasium also un
derwent some renovations this 
summer. The historic gym, built 
in 1924, will host the volleyball 
team this fall and then the mens 
and womens basketball teams in 
the winter.
Carnegie Mellon also welcomes 
two fresh faces to athletics. In 
late April, Matthew Kinney was 
hired as the new head mens and 
womens swimming coach. Over 
the summer, the womens soccer 
program hired Betsy Warren as 
a full-time assistant coach. War
ren replaced Tony Mohammed, 
who took a head-coaching job at 
Wellesley College.
Kinney was the head mens 
and womens swimming coach at 
the University of Mary Washing
ton in Fredericksburg, Va. for 12 
years before taking this Carnegie 
Mellon position.
During his stint at Mary Wash
ington, he led the mens and 
womens teams to a combined 
dual record of 182-59, with 22 
combined Capital Athletic Con
ference (CAC) titles. He has 
coached 88 All-American per
formances and was named CAC 
Coach of the Year 12 times (seven 
times as womens coach and five 
as mens).
Kinney graduated from Kenyon 
College in 1993 and is a native of 
Canton, Ohio. At Kenyon he was 
a three-time All-American for the 
Lords.
Named captain his senior sea
son, he was also a part of three 
NCAA Division III National 
Championship teams.
While obtaining his masters 
degree, Kinney served as an as
sistant coach at Western Illinois 
University. He has also coached 
at the Macomb (111.) Senior High 
School and at the Macomb County 
YMCA.
Warren served as an assistant 
coach at Ashland University for 
the past three seasons, and before 
that served as an assistant at Bryn 
Mawr School for Girls, Dundalk 
Senior High School in Maryland, 
and also Pulaski County High 
School in Virginia.
Warren was a three-year starter 
in college at Radford University 
and enjoyed tremendous success. 
She was named captain her se
nior season, and she helped the 
Highlanders win the Big South 
Conference tournament and 
regular season titles. Radford 
also earned a bid to the NCAA 
Division I tournament during her 
playing days.
Last year, the mens swimming 
and diving team placed third at 
UAAs and the womens team took 
home fourth place. The womens 
soccer team finished last sea
son with a record of 8-7-1 and a 
sixth-place finish in the UAA..

Get your cheap on
Dorm decor for the desperately drained
Cant afford any Picassos to adorn your dorm 
room? Cant even afford the $9.99 shipping and 
handling for that 1 cent Picasso print being 
auctioned off on eBay? Dont fret  you can keep 
yourself out of white cinder block hell without 
breaking the bank. Try a few of the ideas below.
Make a postcard wall. Get all your friends 
to send you postcards from their hometowns 
or vacation spots and create a globe-trotting 
display.
Get festive. Raid Target after Christmas to get 
ridiculously cheap lights and wacky ornaments 
that will look totally sweet year-round.
Raid the toy box. Poke around in the attic the 
next time youre home and pick out some of your 
most awesome toys or childhood art. Why not let 
Spiderman hold one of your favorite photos, or 
else line a shelf with trolls?
Go for a theme. If you and your roommate can 
agree on one thing you like  the beach, Paris, 
robots, vampires  why not go for a theme 
decoration? If you're both into the beach, find 
some shells, invest in a couple leis and fake palm 
tree posters from the party store, and go wild.
Hit up the color printer. Instead of buying 
posters of your favorite paintings, print a couple 
out in a cluster near you (CFA or the fourth floor 
of Hunt Library).
Make a collage. Rescue some magazines and 
newspapers from the recycling bin, cut out 
anything that looks cool, and glue it down. Make ' 
a whole collection of eyes to put near the fridge 
to make sure your roomie doesnt steal your milk, 
or put Bushs head on Britney's body. Or, make 
some angst-filled poetry cut from newspaper 
headlines. (Post-Gazettes, of course, not Tartans.)
Make your own paper cutout wall art. Get
your Matisse on. Invest in a pack of construction 
paper and cut out some shapes, then slap them 
on the wall with a little Scotch tape. Cover your 
walls with flowers, cityscapes, stormtroopers
 whatever tickles your fancy.
Frame things that arent paintings. Save old 
scraps of fabric and wrapping paper, then just 
grab a couple frames from Goodwill, and voil! 
Instant art. ->
Light it up. A colorful lantern or two will cut 
right through life-sucking fluorescent lights. You 
can find some at thrift stores or at Target, and if 
the lanterns you find aren't colorful enough,, help 
them out by gluing on cut paper, pressed leaves, 
or pictures from magazines.
Art: D.I.Y. Look for old canvasses at yard sales 
before the weather gets , cold and buy a couple 
tubes of paint from the art store. You dont 
have to be an artistic genius  just swirl a 
couple colors you like together and youll have 
something nice to look at.
Make a paper chain. Cut up some colorful 
paper and tape each strip into a ring. If youre 
feeling symbolic you can even write some kind 
of message on each link of the chain. Or, make 
one ring for each school day in the semester and 
rip one off each day. Hang your completed chain 
around your window or bed.
Read the funnies. Cut out all your favorite 
comic strips and make a funny wall to cheer you 
up during those long nights when its just you 
and biochem.
Now, go forth and be creative!

Everything you need to know
About dating and dirty dishes
Dear Myrtle, Dear Myrtle,
What do you think about 
online dating? I tried finding 
girls in real life, but it just 
didnt pan out. Its all so much 
easier online, and you can 
learn if somebody would be 
compatible with you before 
meeting them. What do you 
say?
Online Dating Devotee
Hey there ODD
Ive done some online dating 
in my time (have you tried 
okcupid.com?) and it definitely 
has its pluses and minuses.
Sure, it seems like you can get 
some idea of your compatibility 
before meeting the person, but 
that doesnt mean itll turn out 
the way you think. You might 
have a lot in common with 
somebody who turns out to be 
an ultra-weird eyebrow-fetishist 
Scientologist (unless youre into 
that, in which case, woohoo for 
you) or somebody who turns out 
to be a 500-pound middle-aged 
guy named Larry, instead of a 19- 
year-old blonde. Besides, theres 
always the chance that your 
blipd date will kill you  always 
take your first dates to well-lit, 
crowded places and/or take 
along a burly friend. That being 
said, online dating can be a great 
way to build up your confidence, 
and you might actually meet 
somebody great. So, I would say 
keep it up if youre careful, but I 
advise joining anew club, taking 
up a new sport, or volunteering 
somewhere; trying something 
new is a great way to meet new 
people, not to mention a great 
way to learn about yourself.
Myrtle
i live off campus, and my 
roommates are sweet and all, 
but they seem to be incapable 
of washing dishes. The sink 
is always crammed full, 
attracting flies and stinking 
like hell. I cant even get in 
the sink to do my dishes. 
When my roommates dishes 
are all dirty, they use mine! 
And, Myrtle, we even have 
a dishwasher! Ive talked to 
them about it; and when I do, 
they get better for a couple of 
days, but then the sink is full 
again. What do I do?
Frustrated in Squirrel Hill
My poor FISH,
Been there, man. One of the 
problems with living off campus 
is that you don't have an RA to 
mediate tough problems for you. 
Its time to call a house meeting 
and explain clearly what your 
problem is, why it bothers you, 
and what you would like them to 
do; but dont dictate  discuss. 
Try to tell them whats wrong by 
explaining how it inconveniences 
you  flies, hard to do your own 
dishes, etc.  rather than calling 
them the disgusting, disrespectful 
slobs they are. Make it clear that 
you would prefer them not to 
use your dishes without asking; 
focus on yourself and what you 
need. If that still doesnt work, 
or if tempers run high, you could 
try bringing in an unbiased party 
(a friend of a friend, perhaps) to 
help mediate. As a last resort, 
you could get a crate and stack 
the dirty dishes outside, where 
the flies can feast as they please 
and the sink will be clean. Good 
luck!

Tales of the Infinite Absolute
Art professor plants Seeds, sends waves into space
You are holding two small metallic eggs, one in each hand. 
One is in your left, one is in your right. They are curious 
objects, as you are unable to determine whether they 
occurred naturally or were created by mankind. To you, they 
feel powerful. Now you place them to rest, one at the top of 
the Taygetos Mountains, the other you let slide from your 
fingers into the sea.
While this may sound like a fantasy-imbued dream, it is 
the culmination of 30 years of work by Carnegie Mellon art 
professor Lowry Burgess. As the sixth piece of Burgess's 
Quiet Axis project, Seeds of the Infinite Absolute seeks to 
display and try to understand the power of infinities.
Over the past 30 years, Burgess has planned and then 
collected the elements that compose the seeds, his two 
metallic eggs. Each is purified from the emotional and 
physical substances that define our reality, including the 
blood of artists, sap from 44 types of trees, and crushed 
vermillion, the last of which was placed in a room where 60 
pairs of people exchanged telepathic plans for the future. 
These elements were chosen to represent a distillation of 
our reality into a purer form. Burgess explained, for example, 
"with 52 flowers, which were collected from all over the
world... there is one blooming for each week of the year, an 
ever-blooming flower, a flower of flowers."
Many of the materials that have been distilled were collected 
by Burgess himself, such as samples from rivers including the 
Nile, Tigris, Euphrates, Ganges, Mississippi, and the Murray 
in Australia. The collection and method become part of the 
experience, a ritual for understanding our position between 
opposing infinities.
Both seeds have now been placed: The seed at the bottom 
of the Mediterranean will be sucked into the Calypso 
Deep, where the African continental plate dives beneath 
the Eurasian plate, and where the seeds will eventually be . 
crushed; and the seed in the mountains will slowly erode. 
They were placed there, each pulling at the other so that, as 
Burgess describes, between these two infinities, the one 
of crushing pressure, and the one of release, is most of our 
reality.
With the completion of Burgess's work on Seeds, he will focus 
on deep space. In 1989, Burgess was the first artist to have his 
work taken into space as an official payload by NASA, and he 
is now again exploring space, specifically the balance point,
Holler at your boys
Philly thrillers bring the party to the people
Having friends in the music business has worked to the
 advantage of Philadelphia-based emcees Diplo, Hollertronix, 
and Spank Rock. Diplo (real name Wesley Pentz), whose 
upbringing in Mississippi factors into his melding of dirty 
South and Miami bass beats with current hip-hop and rap 
tracks, fuses music styles from Tel Aviv to Rio into danceable 
mixes.
In 2004 Diplo released his debut full-length album, Florida, an 
11-track smorgasbord spanning such genres as Brazilian baile 
funk, instrumental hip-hop, and cinematic electrnica. The 
single "Diplo Rhythm was featured on Grey's Anatomy and 
exemplified Diplo's ability to smoothly incorporate seemingly 
disparate styles of music. As of 2006, Diplo added impresario 
to his credentials by founding his own label, Mad Decent. The 
DJ wunderkinds lengthy list of collaborators includes British 
singer and former girlfriend M.I.A., for whom he remixed 
several singles for the compilation Piracy Funds Terrorism.
Along with DJ Low Budget, Diplo has branched into the 
mashup genre under the moniker Hollertronix. This year 
alone, the duet released remixes of Peter Bjorn and Johns 
indie-pop tune Young Folks and Daft Punks techno blaster 
"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger. They have sampled 
everything from Three 6 Mafia to Modest Mouse and 
ingeniously interweaved The Clashs "Rock the Casbah with 
Missy Elliotts "Gossip Folks. The boisterous Beat boys have 
amassed a following of party-hearty trendsters as a result of 
their accessible yet creative mashups.
Taking a hint from the buzz surrounding these 
up-and-comers, London dance club Fabric dipped into the
Philadelphia DJ pool and enlisted both Diplo and Spank Rocks 
talents, resulting in the releases of Fabriclive 24 and Fabriclive 
33. The two compilations include remixes of Aphex Twin, 
Ludacris, Chicks on Speed, and Hot Chip. Especially since 
they debuted merely a year ago, this was a commendable 
honor for Spank Rock.
Laying rapid-fire rhymes over bass-heavy electro-rap 
beats, the Spank Rock collective  comprised of Armani 
XXXchange, Chris Rockswell, and Spank Rock  never fails 
to stimulate a crowd with their vibrant sound. Since Spank 
Rock's 2006 debut album Y0Y0Y0Y0Y0 exploded onto the 
flashy Philadelphia party scene, the group has been hailed by 
critics, among them Radiohead frontman Thom Yorke, who 
lauded the album as one of his favorites. The group has toured 
with Hollertronix and M.I.A. and opened for Beck and Bjork, 
but Spank Rock's accomplishments do not stop there. Xfm 
London named the group's single Bump" Single of the Year in 
2006, and the hip-jerking anthem "Backyard Betty appeared 
in the video game Madden NFL 07.
Philadelphia new schoolers Diplo, Hollertronix, and Spank 
Rock have quickly made a name for themselves in the City 
of Brotherly Love and beyond, turning concert venues into 
sweaty dance parties where anyone can be, as Spank Rock 
puts it, "an ass-shakin' competition champ.

Winehouse is full of soul, and Challengers faces challenges
Amy Winehouse, Back to Black
With most of Hollywood in rehab this summer, Amy 
Winehouse's infamous summer anthem "Rehab arrived 
with perfect timing. The remainder of Back to Black, 
her sophomore album, is a surprising blend of old soul 
and new R&B. Winehouse matches her unexpectedly 
bluesy voice with background vocals and instruments 
played in the fashion of 50s and '60s super girl groups 
with a twist; instead of dwelling on lost love, Winehouse 
manipulates her vocals to sing about other topics: the 
troubles of unworthy men, her addiction to booze, and, 
in Addicted, her refusal to share her weed.
Winehouse has the ability to connect with her listeners 
with honest lyrics and a language so completely 
unanticipated. This albums old-soul feel is more 
pronounced than Winehouses debut, Frank. Back to 
Black shows a more gutsy Winehouse, as she trades 
in her first effort's hip-hop for blues, as evidenced by 
various stand-out songs, from Tears Dry On Their
The albums other tracks seem to be a portrayal of Gym 
Class Heroes's move to the mainstream, with catchy 
lyrics and beats that skim the surface, refusing to go as 
deep as Chronicles. Still, it was School Children that put 
Gym Class Heroes on the map.

The New Pornographers, Challengers
The biggest problem with The New Pornographers's 
latest record, Challengers, is that many of its songs 
would sound far too fitting in places where respectable, 
worthwhile music rarely gets played. If someone were 
eating at Wendys, watching the credits of a romantic 
comedy, or shopping at Target and one of Challengerss 
songs came oh, it wouldnt seem out of place. The 
music is a little too "feel good, even maudlin at times. 
This is not to say that this music is vapid, or even that
If someone were eating at Wendys, watching 
the credits of a romantic comedy, or shopping at 
Target and one of Challengerss song came on, it 
wouldnt seem out of place.
Own, to Me & Mr Jones. Her modern twist on classic 
music is versatile enough to attract different audiences
 by no means an easy feat.
Gym Class Heroes, As Cruel As School Children
This summer, Gym Class Heroes made a surprise 
appearance on the mainstream music scene with their 
infectiously glorified single, Cupids Chokehold." But, 
like Amy Winehouse, Gym Class Heroes are more 
experienced than the new artist label they have thus far 
attained. As Cruel As School Children is the third album 
featuring the dynamic vocals of frontman Travis McCoy, 
who acts as the representative personality of the group. 
(Gym Class Heroes was, as the name might suggest, 
formed in McCoys and drummer Matt McGinleys 
gym class around 1999.) The indie group perfected its 
effortless blend'of hip-hop and rock somewhere between 
2005s The Papercut Chronicles and the original release 
of As Cruel As School Children in the summer of 2006.
The groups newest album, upbeat and optimistic in 
both rhythm and lyrics, is an absolute reversal from 
Chronicles  a more somber record, successful in 
its contemplation of drug addictions, family deaths, 
and broken hearts. McCoys soul is less evidently in 
School Children, but his catching vocals are almost 
overwhelming, especially in tracks like "Viva La White 
Girl  which, McCoy assures his audiences, is not 
about white girls, but a metaphor for his love of music.
all music that blends harmlessly into the background is 
somehow innately bad, but its definitely not a trait that 
an indie band wants associated with its music.
Fortunately, The New Pornographers are very skilled 
at crafting pop songs. Songwriters A.C. Newman and 
Dan Bejar offer fun and whimsical melodies that are 
catchy in a good way. Their lyrics are creative and 
clever, nonsensical in a way that is never intimidating 
or pointless. The instrumentation on Challengers is 
also impressive. The New Pornographers manage 
to incorporate a multitude of unusual instruments
 shaker eggs, French horns, and strings  that never 
sound superfluous or intrusive. The guitar effects and 
tones are worth marveling over for their appropriateness 
and ingenuity, most notably in the song "Entering White 
Cecilia, and the riffs are as much as an indie rock fan 
could ask for.
The sheer talent of The New Pornographers is what 
allows this record to work. But, the frenzied exuberance 
of previous albums like Twin Cinema and Mass 
Romantic (think of the song "The Bleeding Heart Show) 
is lost. So, while The New Pornographers remain a 
superior group, the undesirable meekness of their new 
sound is causing them to stand out less and less from 
your average pop band.

radio station.On cool-down music
it is impossible to have a conversation without someone bringing up 
the heat. Relentless sunlight boils our flesh and swampy humidity 
makes even typing a sweaty affair. My pink is peeling off and my 
brain is in a liquid state  and, reader, I am sure you feel the same. 
With that in mind, here is a playlist of songs for suckling popsicies.
Bauhaus, Mask. In Mask, Bauhaus sends you directly inside the 
thick stone walls of a subterranean dungeon. Peter Murphy moans 
in pain, with cymbals crashing like whips. Its all dark and gloomy 
and goth until the 2:40 mark, when a beautiful, light guitar melody 
replaces whips and moans. The shadow is cast, Murphy cries. 
Hurrah! I need some shade.
Junior Boys, Double Shadow. The Canadian duos beats are 
always icy  especially this one, which has whispering vocals that 
are not warmly romantic. Instead, Double Shadow begins with 
some unromantic insults, and then launches into an understated beat 
with a compliment: you good fuck. At least whoever this song is 
tearing to shreds has that, right? That, and a surprisingly soulful track 
complete with handclaps in their memory.
Pluxus, Solid State. This Scandinavian electro track begins with 
a slow, jingling beat, reminiscent of ice cubes clinking in glasses. 
Quickly, other synthetic sounds roll in, sounding like the best parts of 
summer - clicking cameras, an oscillating fan, the hum of insects 
at nightfall, a carnival melody, the plinking of coins into a fountain.
Still, the mood is not nostalgic. This slow, dark, and fizzy song seems 
tired of the summer heat.
M83, Teen Angst. What goes together better than teen angst and 
the dying days of summer?* Ethereal male vocals, a throbbing beat, 
and hazy guitar washes make this an idea! song to listen to during a 
dusk walk amid the mosquitoes.
TV On The Radio, Wear You Out Wear You Out begins as a 
vocal-driven track, with Adebimpes voice fluttering effortlessly above 
simple drumming. Soon, gentle chimes, horns, and bass arrive and 
his voice swoops back down to sensually meld with the chugging, 
bluesy orchestra. After a blast of heat, TVOTR cools it off with an icy 
flute jam.
The Flaming Lips, Bad Days. Just when students start dreading 
the start of class and the onslaught of work, Wayne Coyne reminds 
us, You have to sleep late when you can, and all your bad days will 
end. Take heed from this surprisingly low-key Flaming Lips track. 
Sleep will be torn from our sweaty grasp all too soon, and when the 
cool fall comes we will be wishing for summertime once again.

Fresh food
New spots for bites in the Burgh
At the start of a new semester, there are a lot of new things 
to experience: new classes, new professors, and new friends, 
to name a few. With all of these fresh starts and exciting new 
opportunities, why stick to the same old food? Check out 
these new restaurants in Pittsburgh for a taste of something 
different.
Marzoni's Brick Oven & Brewing 4643 Route 8, Allison 
Park. 412.486.9291.
Popular beer and pizza destination Marzoni's recently opened 
a second location in Hampton. In addition to pizza, Marzoni's

which is shipped to Hampton from the original location. There 
are six different brews to try, and if you'd like to try them all 
at once (and are of age), they offer a sampler. Prices here are 
moderate with the most expensive entre costing about $22.
Imagines 631 Painters Run Road, Upper St. Clair. 
412.221.0350.
While Imagines itself is new, the food isn't. Imagines is 
located in Upper St. Clair, and it recently took over the old 
restaurant Pasquarellis. Despite the new name, many Of 
the favorite dishes from Pasquarellis are still being served.
In addition to the Italian dishes carried over from.before, 
Imagines serves a variety of creative new entres and meats. 
Entres run $9$28, and the price includes a full meal with 
bread, soup, salad, vegetables, and either pasta or potatoes. 
Both lunch and dinner are served daily.
Palate 212 Sixth St. 412.434.1422.
Located downtown in the Cultural District, Palate is a modern 
bistro serving a variety of foods in the French-fusion style.
The prices for dinner and the theater tasting menu arent 
cheap, but the bistro offers a happy hour with $5 appetizers 
and a few sandwiches. The bar menu hours are 4:00-6:00 
p.m. and 10:00 p.m.-l:00 a.m. Palate also offers a variety of 
desserts, and the restaurant includes a lounge area in addition 
to restaurant seating.
Muriels 856 Western Ave. 412.322.0476.
Muriels, a small restaurant on the North Side, recently won a 
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reader poll for best American cuisine 
in Pittsburgh. Located in a Victorian house, Muriels has a 
small dining room in addition to the outdoor seating area.
The food is relatively inexpensive and healthy. Muriels serves 
lunch and dinner Monday-Saturday, and a popular brunch on

The Lookout
Thursday, August 30
8 10 12
Scott Frank, the screenwriter 
behind Minority Report, 
makes his directing debut 
in the Memento-like thriller 
The Lookout. After losing his 
short-term memory in a car 
crash, Chris Pratt (Joseph 
Gordon-Levitt) adjusts to a 
mundane life consisting of 
physical therapy and a night 
job as a janitor. All of thats 
fine, or at least manageable, 
until a smooth-talking new 
friend convinces Pratt 
to play a part in a bank 
robbery. Intriguing plotline 
aside, the movie Is worth it 
for Gordon-Levitt alone  in 
case your 10 Things I Hate 
About You DVD Is skipping.
Red Road
Thursday, September 6
8 10 12
Set in Glasgow, Scotland, 
Red Road follows a CCTV 
(closed circuit television) 
operator named Jackie.
We get a vibe she has a 
tortured past, but the real 
trouble starts when Jackie 
recognizes a man she sees 
on the job (he lives in the 
Red Road flats  hence 
the name). Jackie starts 
watching him and stalking 
him obsessively, eventually 
seducing him, filing a false 
rape charge, and landing him 
in jail. The intriguing part is 
that we dont learn until the 
end how Jackie knows this 
man, or what she wants with 
him.
Grindhouse
Friday, August 31 
6:30 10
If paying $1 for a movie is 
a bargain, paying $1 for 
two movies has got to be a 
steal. Grindhouse channels 
the drive-in horrors of the 
50s, offering a duo of films 
by cult heroes Quentin 
Tarantino and Robert 
Rodriguez. First up is Death 
Proof, Tarantinos serialkiller flick with the predator 
using his car as the weapon 
of choice. Then theres 
Rodriguezs Planet Terror, a 
zombie thriller worth a watch 
if only because we go to 
school in Pittsburgh.
Spider-Man 3
Friday, September 7 
7:30 10 12:30
Spider-Man 3 continues 
in the campiness of the 
series part deux, primarily 
in its setup. Newcomer 
Thomas Haden Church 
falls into a sand-filled 
particle accelerator, which, 
instead of killing him, turns 
him into a super villain 
called Sandman... with 
the phenomenal power to 
disintegrate into sand. And, 
some alien ooze latches 
onto Peters moped during 
an evening under the stars 
with Mary Jane (talk about 
an awkward date). The 
ooze later climbs onto 
Peters costume and alters 
his personality, which is 
illustrated by the suit turning 
black. Deep.

Zodiac
Saturday, September 1
7 10 1
If you changed the plot of 
All the Presidents Men to 
portray a homicidal Richard 
Nixon, youd pretty much 
have Zodiac. It has all the 
glamour of a smoke-filled 
70s newsroom, where we 
watch the employees of the 
San Francisco Chronicle (a 
snappily on-point Robert 
Downey Jr. and an adorably 
obsessive Jake Gyllenhaal) 
try to find a serial killer 
without so much as a dial
up connection. Keep in 
mind, though, that the movie 
tells the story of an unsolved 
mystery  so dont expect 
a tightly stitched ending.
Rang de Basanti
Saturday, September 8 
7 10 1
Bollywood! In Rang de 
Basanti, some college 
slackers agree to participate 
in a documentary about 
the Indian Independence 
Movement. The students 
play characters involved 
in the revolutions terrorist 
underbelly, and they are 
soon inspired to ditch their 
apathetic tendencies in favor 
of patriotic passion. History 
repeats itself, and the group 
takes on a corrupt defense 
minister in the spirit of the 
characters they play. The 
result is largely successful, 
though a little forced at the 
films end. Its two hours 
and 37 minutes  bring a 
bedpan.
Day Watch
Sunday, September 2 
7:30 10 12:30
Russian fantasy Day Watch 
might not make sense 
unless youve seen Night 
Watch, the first of the series, 
but here goes: Anton, the 
hero from the first film, 
returns to his role as the 
middleman between a pair 
of contending groups called 
the Light and Dark Others, 
humans with supernatural 
powers on the respective 
fronts of good and evil.
Anton canoodles with 
love interest Svetlana (no, 
not the girl from The Real 
World], and the pair seeks 
out something called the 
Chalk of Fate, a super-sweet 
writing implement with the 
capability to rewrite history.
Plan 9 From 
Outerspace
Sunday, September 9 
8:30 10 11:30
Many people consider Plan
9 From Outer Space to be 
the worst movie ever made.
It might be worth it to see 
Plan 9 for that reason alone, 
to make yourself feel better 
about all the slightly less-bad 
movies youve seen. If not, 
heres a story: Writer/director 
Edward D. Wood Jr. wanted 
Bela Lugosi to be in his movie 
so badly that when the actor 
died mid-movie, he hired his 
wifes chiropractor to stand in 
for the role.

The sports section includes an 
instructional article on how to 
swim. The average swimmer-to-be, 
says the writer, requires six to 10 
lessons to master the art of not 
drowning. The author makes a 
point to discourage the age-old 
technique of throwing a kid in a 
river and (assuming he survives) 
teaching him to swim.
A Tartan writer enrolled in Margaret 
Morrison Carnegie College 
complains that none of her classes 
have any boys in them. Sure, she 
writes, the boys dont want to 
take cooking or sewing,-but they 
wouldnt be so out of place in 
classes like English and history. 
50 years later, take a seat behind 
one of those all-work, no-shower 
boys, and youll see why some 
people thought it was a good idea 
to separate the sexes.
An ad appears for roller-skating on 
the Cut, $1 per hour on a Friday

Michigan University. Well, at least 
we still have dibs on gems like

OMFG.
Pillbox releases its first issue, 
encompassing the former Arts & 
Living and Entertainment sections 
in a single tabloid. The name 
Pillbox, says a letter from the 
editor, is supposed to represent 
something hip and innovative. 
Well, that might be true  but 
in 2007, the name Pillbox is 
more likely to connote something 
confusing, mysterious, and vaguely 
medicated.
A Tartan writer rails against a staple 
of many peoples college diets: 
ramen noodles. According to the 
article, one package of ramen 
contains about 1800 milligrams 
of sodium. It's death - just add

Photo editing is a great way to turn a 
realistic photo into something... slightly 
less plausible.
J.W. Ramp I Assistant Photo EditorLike Photoshop, but easier
Graduate students bring photo editing to the masses
People always bring back the same couple of things from 
family vacations: tan lines, empty wallets, made-in-China 
souvenirs, and  of course  photographs. And no family 
album could be complete without the requisite duds: Moms 
poorly timed shot of Lake Winnipesaukee, obscured by that 
boat that sailed into the picture; Dads artsy still of Abbey 
Road at sunrise, looking eerily vacant instead of serene. 
Hoping to remedy such photo faux pas, researchers at 
Carnegie Mellon developed two new photo editing techniques 
that could help the next family album earn its place on the 
coffee table.
Ditching the sailboat
James Hays, a Ph.D. candidate in SCSs Graphics Lab, created 
a system called Scene Completion; he designed the technique 
around flicki.com. Scene Completion may just be the perfect 
solution for a botched Winnipesaukee scene  the software 
makes it easy to fill in a photographs holes, whether from 
physical damage or the removal of an object (an obtrusive 
sailboat, for example). It considers the colors and textures 
of the spot surrounding the hole, in addition to contextual 
factors; it wont suggest a giraffe to fill a lake, for example.
Using this criteria, the Scene Completion method presents 
its user with a list of up to 20 images that can fill in the hole. 
So, Mom can choose to add a kayak, another sailboat, a 
swimming tourist, etc. Not all of the 20 photographs will fit in 
the picture (some might not match the lighting, for example), 
but two or three likely will. The method has a low success 
rate," said Hays. It needs a lot of data. The accuracy of 
Scene Completion increases with the amount of images it can 
search from.
Populating Abbey Road
For Dad's deserted Abbey Road, graduate student 
Jean-Frangois Lalonde created a technique called Photo Clip
Art. Lalondes method uses images divided into categories, 
such as people, cars, and trees. We want to add specific 
objects," he said. The program asks its user to click on a 
photographs horizon line, which it uses to define criteria 
for the images that someone might want to add. At this 
point, if a user clicks on car," the program will show all 
of its photographs of cars in an ordered list; the ones that 
closest match the original images lighting and camera angle 
conditions are listed at the top.
Photo Clip Art is especially useful for people interested in 
modeling projects, such as an architect proposing a building 
plan or a screenwriter working on a storyboard. An architect, 
for example, might be interested in seeing how the lawn of 
a prospective complex would look with people on it, Lalonde 
explained.
Aside from the specifics, the overwhelming benefit of both 
photo editing projects is that Mom and Dad can actually use 
them. "Our goal was to make this not completely automatic 
but as easy as possible, Lalonde said. Users need not 
understand Adobe Photoshop  or even Microsoft Paint  to 
use the software.
Credibility
With this kind of accessibility, theres a risk that editing 
photographs could become too easy. If Mom and Dad can 
add a car and subtract a sailboat from every family picture, 
the entire album could lose its credibility. Moreover, if 
photojournalists can add, say, an exploding warhead to a 
photograph of Iraq, it could lead to credibility problems that 
eclipse even the Joness Family Album.
"There's been reason to be suspicious of photos for a long 
time, said Hays. Although the techniques coming from 
Carnegie Mellon may be new, the results that they achieve 
have long been possible through tools like Photoshop and
other programs. In terms of what you can do, said Hays, the 
sky is the limit."
And in a way, it always has been. One of the earliest photo 
controversies dates back to 1858, when Henry Peach 
Robinson published a photograph called Fading Away. The 
picture showed a young girl dying while her family watched 
and wept, but there was only one problem: It wasnt real. The 
people in the photograph were all actors, and, on top of that, 
Robinson created the image by combining the negatives of 
five separate photographs.
The public got really upset. They got duped, said Charlee 
Brodsky, a professor in the School of Art. Its easy to think 
that new technology in photo editing is going to change 
photography forever, or at least its credibility. But, as Brodsky 
explained, the Scene Completion and Photo Clip Art projects 
are only newer and easier ways to create effects that have 
been possible for years. I think that what people might not 
know is that weve had trickster photography for a long time," 
said Brodsky. We had photographic manipulation in the 
darkroom.
With Carnegie Mellons tools for the technology-deficient, 
Mom and Dad could become the next Henry Peach Robinson.

Revealing Nakashima
August means moving into college, and moving into college means 
IKEA. So, it might be easy to forget that furniture is more than 
something to buy for cheap and sit on - you can look at it, too. 
Nakashima Revealed: The Carnegie Mellon Collection is the Regina 
Gouger Miller Gallerys newest exhibit, featuring furniture crafted 
by Japanese-American designer George Nakashima. Nakashima 
created many one-of-a-kind pieces, each inspired by the patterns in 
the wood he was using. Carnegie Mellon bought about 60 pieces of 
Nakashimas furniture in the mid-'60s, some of which is now in Miller 
Gallery for the exhibit. Nakashima Revealed starts with an opening 
reception on Friday, August 31 from 5 to 8 p.m. The exhibit runs 
through October 28.
Lecture series begins
The School of Arts fall lecture series begins on Tuesday, September 
4 with a lecture by Andrea Fraser. Fraser is known for her work in 
various realms, including performance, video, and contextual art. 
Shes worked on group installations and solo projects, in addition 
to writing multiple essays and performance scripts. Fraser is also 
an associate professor in the department of art at the University of 
California, Los Angeles. Fraser lectures in Kresge Hall at 5 p.m.
