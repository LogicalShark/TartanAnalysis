Tech Wins from F. & M. in Rough Game
The football game on the Field last Saturday 
brought every true son and daughter of Carnegie 
Tech into a state of frenzied enthusiasm over the 
game itself as well as its outcome. With Pitt playing 
out of town many more visitors were present than 
at any previous contest.
The band began the gayety by discoursing lively 
airs and continued their good work throughout the 
game. Cheers broke first from the small group of 
F. & M. rooters gathered in the middle stand and 
were soon drowned by the song Carnegie and the 
locomotive. F. & M.s Yah-team yell sounded much 
like the discarded wail of Holdem Tech. With both 
teams on the field the afternoons event began.
First Half.
F. & M. won the toss and defended the eastern 
goal. Tech kicked off, the ball going to F. & M.s 
five-yard line, where Richards caught it and re
turned it 18 yards. F. & M. tried the on-side kick, 
the ball going to the center of the field. Coldren ran 
it back to F. & M.s 38-yard line. On a delayed pass 
Hittner fumbled the ball, F. & M. recovering it. By 
a series of end runs and concerted and powerful 
line bucks, F. & M. rushed the ball over the line. 
The goal was missed. Score, F. & M. 5, Tech 0.
The Tech team arose to the issue in grand fashion. 
F. & M. kicked to Hittner on the 6-yard line and Billy 
returned the ball 10 yards. Robinson made 10 yards 
through the line and Flick followed by eight more
around the end. By good hard line bucking and end 
runs, aided by splendid interference, Tech carried the 
ball to F. & M.s 30-yard mark, where it was lost on 
a fumble. F. & M. failed to gain and a kick was 
called for. Marshal blocked it and Tech recovered 
the ball on F. & M.s 23-yard line. Hittner and 
Coldren carried the ball to the 8-yard line. On a 
forward pass the ball was carried over. Hittner 
kicked the goal. Score, F. & M. 5, Tech 6.
F. & M. kicked to Tech on the 12-yard mark, Dolin 
getting the ball. Tech then carried the ball right up 
the field to F. & M.s 8-yard line, where the ball was 
lost on a forward pass. F. & M. kicked to their 40- 
yard line. Again Tech brought the ball back, this 
time to the 3-yard line, only to lose it on another 
attempted forward pass. F. & M. kicked out to the 
50-yard line and Tech was returning the ball when 
time was called. Score for this halfF. & M. 5, 
Tech 6.
Between Halves.
When the rooting section had rested their yells 
from the overexertion of doing justice to the first 
Tech touchdown and the success of the shift play, it 
was all hands out on the Field for a pe-rade. The 
band preceded and the cheer leaders acting as ring
masters had a snake dance 560 feet long, marching 
about the field. The human centipede by lifting its 
thousand legs in unison with the high step, made 
almost as big a hit with the grandstand as the

---------------------------------------------------

THE TARTAN
cheering with the men formed into a huge C. From 
the stands the song Carnegie, given on the opposite 
side of the field, was a roar of sound in perfect time 
and unison, the volume of which has never been 
heard here before. Such a snake dance is too good a 
stunt to ever be omitted at any of the games. The 
F. & M. rooters rose and cheered their team as it 
trotted on the field.
Second Half.
In this half Tech completely outplayed F. & M. 
F. & M. was unable to get the ball in Techs terri
tory except on punts. Techs offense was quick 
and fierce and gained 324 yards to F. & M.s 46. 
Coldren ran the team well and in points of strategy 
he turned loose plays that had F. & M. up in the#
air the greater part of the time.
On the kick-off Hitner received the ball on his 
1-yard line. He started straight up the field. At the 
35-yard line he emerged into the open, Dolin mak
ing his interference. Richards ran across the field 
but Dolin blocked him and Hittner was behind the 
goal. Umpire Knox decided that Dolin had held 
Richards and the ball was therefore brought back to 
Techs 50-yard line. Tech was not to be stopped by 
a little thing like that, however. Coldren made first 
down on an end run. Hittner followed with 12 more. 
Coldren again was there with eight. On third down 
Tech failed at a forward pass and it was F. & M.s 
ball on their 24-yard line. Richards punted to 
Techs 38-yard mark. Hittner returned the ball 24 
yards. F. & M. was penalized five yards for off-side 
and Robinson made eight yards on a center buck. 
When Tech tried an on-side kick Richards caught it 
on his 16-yard line. Flick and Morris nailed him on 
the spot. Richards chased around the Tech left end 
12 yards, but Saylor was thrown back for a two-yard 
loss. Hittner caught Richards punt on his 45-yard 
line and ran it back to the F. & M. 33-yard line. 
By a series of forward passes and line plunges Tech 
got the ball on F. & M.s four-yard line. A forward 
pass was tried and F. & M. recovered the ball, kick
ing it out to their 48-yard line. Hittner ran it back 
23 yards. Tech was thrown for two losses and was 
forced to kick. Dolin kicked high into the. air, the 
ball coming down on the three-yard line. Jaeger and 
Richards were waiting to receive it and so was 
Morris for Tech. But none got it and Robinson 
dashed in and dove over the line with the ball, both 
F. & M. beckfield men hanging on to him. No goal 
was kicked. ScoreF. & M. 5, Tech 11.
F. & M. kicked to Tech and the ball was worked 
down into the F. & M. territory when time was called.

At the End of the Game.
The moment the whistle blew the last time the 
rooting section swarmed onto the field and bodily 
carried the entire team to the dressing rooms on 
their shoulders. Dolin was half way across the field 
before being discovered and managed to run the 
gauntlet of the howling mob until the sidelines were 
reached before being hoisted aloft and carried in the 
triumphal procession. Faculty and students lingered 
about waiting an opportunity to personally congratu
late the men and everyone else deserving a share of 
the glory.
Last Half.
The evening found the same bunch of rooters as
sembled ready for business looking down at another 
arena from tiers of seats steeper than those occupied 
in the afternoon peanut heaven in the Alvin.
Both teams were there, too, but the arena was the 
stage with Miss Blanche Ring standing in the center 
leading the cheers. The Tech team in the lower left 
box and F. & M. in the right were the centers of 
interest between acts and were made so part of the 
time during acts by Miss Ring.
It was a great day for Tech.

A WALKING HOTEL.
After a visit to a famous entomologist, whose won
derful microscopes have proved that there is always 
some living being to be found preying on the last of 
the minutest creature last seen, an English writer 
turned to him and said:
I came here, believing myself to be an individual.
I leave, knowing myself to be a community."

THE F. & M.TECH GAME DIAGRAMED.
In the cuts given below every play made in the 
F. & M.-Tech game last Saturday is given. To read 
the diagram begin at the top and work down the 
page, following the path of the ball as indicated by 
the different lines. For the meaning of the lines used 
see the bottom of the first cut. The player that car
ried the ball is denoted by the letters that indicate 
his position.
It will be seen when looking at the cuts, that in
the first half Tech outplayed F. & M. Tech gained 
269 yards to F. & M.s 104. She made 15 first downs 
to F. & M.s 7. In the second half the outplaying of 
F. & M. is even more marked. In this half Tech 
gained 324 yards to F. & M.s 46, and made 13 first
downs to 4 for F. & M. This means that Tech
gained 593 yards to F. & M.s 150 yards, and made
first down 28 times to F. & M.s 11. Tech, on this
showing, should have won the game by a much larger 
score:

6THE TARTAN
IN DREAMLAND.
It was a beautiful warm afternoon of Indian Sum
mer and everything outdoors was quiet and peaceful. 
Not a breath of air was stirring, not a moving crea
ture was to be seen and even the brilliantly colored 
leaves seemed to be drowsily drooping their heads 
as though indulging in a quiet afternoon nap.
I was lying on a little knoll in the park, hidden 
from the road by some trees, lazily enjoying the view 
and trying to study my history. Oh, bother 
Egypt! I exclaimed, letting my book slip through 
my fingers and, leaning back, gave myself up com
pletely to the influence of the afternoon.
Then I noticed for the first time a big yellow 
patch below me. A beautiful tree, I thought, and 
then sat up in astonishment. The leaves seemed to 
blend into one whole, to spread out, to cover the 
ground as far as I could see. Surely I was mistaken! 
But no; there, creeping right up to my feet was a 
yellow sand. It was the desert! I turned, panic 
stricken, but could see nothing but sand, sand, sand, 
and off in the distance a huge black mass. After 
some hesitation I started slowly off, afraid to go, 
yet more afraid to stay.
A slight movement behind me made me turn 
quickly, to discover a most startling spectre. Twas 
as if one of the Sphinxes had come to life, and 
throwing a trailing yellow robe over its shoulder, had 
come to challenge the disturber of its desert home 
Its long robe seemed to blend into the sand, and it 
drifted along without any apparent effort. But the 
eyes had a kindly expression, and the voice, thdugh 
stern, was not harsh as it demanded, What wilt 
thou, O plebe? What doest thou on sacred ground? 
Didst come of thine own volition, or did another 
send thee? Oh, I see. Thou carryest the mark! 
Thou hast scorned the great desert; the wonders of 
the Sphinx have no charms for thee; thou art not 
thrilled and awed by the ruins of ages past. Thy 
doom is sealed! For punishment thou must roam 
over Egypt from end to end, and return again to tell 
of it to thy classmates. Then at my alarmed ex
pression the voice became gentler and continued, 
Perhaps thou thinkest thy little world counts for 
aught in this great universe. But what is it besides 
the centuries? Perhaps thou wouldst collect relics 
of thine own time that would interest the generations 
to come? Slowly it turned, and as it moved, a lotus 
flower, beautiful and fragrant, sprang up, so that 
soon the desert seemed a mass of gold and white. 
At a nod of the spectres head, the flower petals and 
the gold of the desert disappeared, and in their place 
stood a pure white marble building with shining 
pillars of gold.
Enter thou, but do not linger till the set of sun. 
The beautiful, the solemn, that which is worth while 
lies without. So do not linger! Slowly I obeyed 
and my guide took me down a wide hall to a room 
on the door of which was inscribed: English
Miss Fisher. In the room lay two immense 
sarcophagi. Going over to the first, the Sphinx 
solemnly explained, Here lies the blow that killed 
Miss Fisher. Is cannot take an object.  I could 
not refrain from smiling as the voice continued, 
turning to the other grave, Here lie the remains of 
the only two opinions of the plebe As in English 
Skating is good exercise, and To be good is to be 
happy. Many other interesting things are to be 
seen, but we must hasten, hasten!
This, pausing at the door of the next room, we 
dare not enter. Some plebe doubting Professor 
Esquerres word, has combined Hydrogen and Clorine 
and turned on the light and heat! These figures, 
indicating some grotesque stone statues seated or 
standing in various positions in the next room, are 
the results of a remark of one of your classmates. 
Wad some power the gift to gie us, to see ourselves 
as Miss Stoner sees us.  As if in sympathy with 
my merriment the eyes of the Splinx seemed to 
twinkle, but it only repeated, Hasten! Hasten!
An impressive pause was made before a beautiful 
sarcophagus of pure gold; and then, This is the 
voice about which all your teachers harangue. You 
remember, please, Young ladiesher voice was ever 
soft and low.  We then passed into a room decor
ated entirely -with green ribbons, streamers from the 
pillars, from the ceilings, green, green everywhere 
of all possible hues and shades. The Freshmen idea 
of emerald green, briefly explained my guide. Be
yond is the sewing room where your beautiful sam
plers are preserved to hand down the ages. The 
drawing room 
The Sphinx paused, and from afar off came the 
faint sounds of chimes. Then for a moment the 
Sphinx bowed its head and turned its face sadly 
toward me. The evening prayer at the setting of 
the sun! Too long hast thou lingered, O plebe, 
among the trivial things of life. The greater, the 
more beautiful lie near at hand, but thou heedest 
them not. Take warning from the setting of the 
sun.
And suddenly I was out on the desert looking deep 
down into the golden heart of a lotus flower. Slowly 
it changed; golden leaves, then a whole tree stood 
before me, and I turned round to find myself once 
more in the park with the same yellow tree before 
me. The leaves were all nodding in the slight breeze 
as if in merriment to have caught me napping. Lying 
at my feet lay the discarded history, and from its 
pages the eyes of the Sphinx were turned toward 
me, unseeing and unchangeable.

The Dramatic Club held a meeting on Friday for 
the purpose of nominating and electing officers. It 
was well attended by both Juniors and Seniors and

---------------------------------------------------

THE TARTAN7
promises to be a success for the coming year. The 
officers elected were: President, Bess Kelly; secre
tary and treasurer, Josephine Mandeville; librarian, 
Madeline Moore; stage manager, Olvie Freese; assist
ant stage managers, Laureta Kemple and Charlotte 
Shaffner; executive committee, Gertrude Hartman 
and Ruth Turkle.
A name is needed for the Club, and every member 
is asked to think hard for a suitable one before the 
next meeting.
Our school was visited on Friday morning by a 
number of Japanese women, visiting the United 
States with their husbands, who are investigating 
business and educational methods in this country. 
The women were dressed in their native costumes, 
and were a source of wonder and curiosity to the 
girls in the school. Few of them could speak Eng
lish, but they appeared to be very much interested in 
the work done here.
THE THOUGHTS OF A DIETARY GIRL.
If you see this maiden look odd,
When sitting down to meals,
Do not worry at all, my dear,
For this is what she feels: 
How many calories are here?
And, Will this nourish me?
Or, Does my hostess really know 
Food values exactly?
Or is she feeding ignorantly?
Her husband and her child,
With carbohydrates and strong fats,
And proteins, too mild?
These are but gentle psychic whirls 
Of dietary girls!
Madeline Moore, 10.
Dr. Martin (in physiology)Sit up, Miss Summerfield.
Miss S.I cant; my back is too long.
What is the matter with the athletic spirit of our 
girls? Why dont more of them attend the games? 
Their support is needed, not only in a financial way, 
but to cheer the boys on to victory.
OUR ALMA MATER.
Recognizing the deserved popularity of Professor 
Trinks Slide-rule lessons which have been appear
ing in The Tartan, and knowing that the Tech stu
dents are a studious bunch, we consider it our duty 
to further encourage this laudable thirst for knowl
edge.
We print below the Alma Mater. We trust all 
our readers will peruse it carefully and memorize the 
wordseverybody knows the tune. This song was 
never intended to be rendered as a solo. It must be 
enthusiastically shouted by seme six or seven hun
dred lusty throats to bring out its true beauty:
Alma Mater.
AirAuld Lang Syne.
Let all our voices now be raised 
With songs to fill the air,
And all our hearts with music praise 
Our Alma Mater fair.
CHORUS.
Carnegie Tech, we honor thee 
And fondly sing thy praise,
We pledge our lives in memory,
 Thy sons on high to raise.
Let all the echoes ring out celar,
In joyful strains so true,
To greet the Tartan with a cheer,
Red, Yellow, Green and Blue.
Then keep our hopes descending high, 
Far reaching to the sky,
And make us thrill with pride in thee 
Wherever we may be.

EDITORIAL
THE ATHLETIC BOARD.
Last year, after much argumentation, we adopted 
a constitution for the Athletic Association. In this 
constitution it was provided that a board should 
be created, the members of which were to be elected 
from the various classes in the different schools. This 
board was to elect from within itself a chairman, 
preferably the Senior member from the School of 
Applied Science, and was to decide certain questions, 
such as the prices to be charged for games, and to 
determine the general policy of the association. Up 
to the present writing this board has not met. It 
has not appointed a chairman. Neither have all the 
classes elected the representative to which they are 
entitled. In short, the board is as though it did not 
exist, even in name.
The lack of this board throws all the duties pro
vided for it under the constitution upon the shoulders 
of the Treasurer, John Charles, and the football man
ager, Alan Bright. These two men must decide perforce questions which are in no way within their 
province to decide. It means that these two men 
alone are responsible for the acts of the association, 
which should not be. It means that these two men
have twice the amount of work to do that would, 
under natural and logical circumstances, be required 
of them. It is not just, either to them or to the in
terests of athletics at Tech, that this state of affaiis 
should be allowed to continue. See to it that your 
class does its duty by electing a representative, and 
that a meeting is called at once.
THE TECH SPIRIT.
The spirit that is shown by the Tech students is 
beginning to be known and appreciated by the out
side world. A Pittsburgh newspaper last week made 
very favorable comments upon it and compared it 
with the spirit shown at other and older institutions, 
much to our advantage. We are glad, very glad, that 
Tech is making herself felt. We knew that she 
would.
The spirit, as indicated by the cheering at last Sat
urdays game, is certainly worthy of comment. It 
was good, in fact the best we have had this year. 
Every man who was in the rooters stand did his duty 
to Tech and deserves the highest credit for the same.
THE EDITOR GETS IT.
We have often thought about making a'few re
marks along this line but for some reason orother 
have always put it off until the next issue. Now to 
begin with, were not mad or peevish about anything 
not at all; we have been in the business to long 
to do anything like that in print. It wouldnt look 
nice, and we have a keen eye for the beautiful.
A newspaper, or any kind of a paper, is a clearing 
house for trouble. Nearly everybody with a griev
ance wants to rush it into print. The man who 
would be famous often has long talks with us on the 
subject and sometimes writes us letters. We read 
the letters or listen to the sizzle of the pent-up ambi
tion and then go on writing up the last mass meet
ing. The chronic reformer would have a few hours 
time to tell us what we ought to say about the foot
ball team and who we ought to bawl out in the next 
issue. Carnegie Tech has two or three men who can 
write clever verse, and about fifty who try to make 
gleam rhyme with bean. We dont say we can 
write poetry or even verse, but we can tell when 
the other fellow doesnt write it. Then there is the 
class correspondent who declares his rival class eat 
with their hands and put their feet on the tables 
in the commons. We use his contributions that are 
representative of what the spirit of his class ought

* ^p^y
to be and cross out the episodes concerning the 
tough mutts. And last, but not least, we listen to 
all the members of the Rivet-Driven chapter of the, 
Anvil Chorus and merely say, Go to it.
The editors of this paper run it for Carnegie Tech. 
We do the best we can. Our greatest difficulty is 
the lack of honest, well-meant criticism designed to 
build up and not to tear down. We insist that it shall 
be made in a gentlemanly manner, and will gladly 
welcome it in that form. But we would have it 
definitely understood that the editorial staff will not 
permit this paper to become the medium for petty 
grievances, personal spite or mud slinging. Since we 
are responsible for what appears, we reserve the

ful, and will give the reason for such action any

As the Case Tech says, This thing of running a 
college paper is fine business. The printer gets the 
money, the business manager gets the experience, 
and the editor gets Hell.

1913 NIGHT.
Nineteen Thirteen is back again and going right at 
it. There is Zoeller looking more scholarly than ever, 
and Schnnerman with the same old enigmatic smile. 
Vetter doesnt say much, but just turns up year after 
year to tear off a little mathematics and science and 
disappear into obscurity again. Faust had been get 
ting into the lime light recently by the sodium 
method, but from the disastrous results of the last 
experiment he conducted we have no doubt but that 
he would rather remain in the dark. Talk of football 
has been filling the air and with it the names of 
Nelson, the quarter, and McCaffery, the descriptive 
tackier, 13 should be able to give somebody a run 
for his money. With Peabody looking for new con
quests, the old crowd looks very much the same. 13 
is back cn the job.

Mr. MeyerA great many people, when called 
upon to exercise their judgment, just guess twice and 
divide by three. We may add that a lot more ar
rive at about the same results by guess and by gosh.
One of the pleasing features of the F. & M. game 
was the presence of a large number of spectators 
who had no connection with the institutions repre
sented by either of the contesting teams.
All were enthusiastic Tech supporters before the 
game ended, and greatly enjoyed the rooting of both 
sides. This is just as it should be. The way to win 
recognition is to merit it.
Mr. Smith, presenting a mathematical principle, 
said, You can drive a flock of dogs into one end of 
a machine, and obtain sausage at the otherbut you 
cant reverse the process. If it were possible to 
integrate mincemeat, the result would be a strange

The coming Sunday will positively be the last call 
for candidates for the Madolin Club. Any man, in 
any school, day or night, who plays a violin, mando
lin, banjo or guitar, is cordially invited to come to 
the smoking room, A. & J. building, next Sunday at 
3 oclock, to have a trial. It is necessary to take this 
action to meet early engagements. The club will be 
exceptionally well balanced this year, which, together 
with the excellent material already out, insures a 
club which will be hard to beat.
The weeding-cut process has started in the Glee 
Club. Sundays rehearsal was so satisfactory that 
the men were actually surprised at themselves.
Article 8 of the By-Laws of the Glee and Mandolin 
Club states that those members who have attended 
at least 80 per cent of the rehearsals of their respec
tive clubs, and have taken part in all concerts but 
one, including the annual concert in Pittsburgh, shall 
receive the Clubs C. *
Starting Sunday, November 14th, records of attend
ance will be made for the purpose of awarding the 
Clubs C. Absences up to November 14th will not 
be counted in this award.
William H. King, Jr.,
Manager.
If any new man desires a trial he should come to 
the A. & J. assembly room, next Sunday, at 3 oclock. 
This will positively be the last chance. Absences 
will be construed to mean that absentees do not care 
to try further for the club.

APPLIED DESIGN
Both of the Beaux Arts problems given out last 
Saturday were composed by two of our own instruc
tors, Mr. Goodwin and Mr. Campbell. Mr. McGoodwins problem for the Plan men was a swim
ming pool. Here is a subject in which every one is 
interested. The solution is not very difficult, and the 
location of the pool gives a fine chance for every 
man to do his best. We are all very grateful that 
no cross-section was required. The esquissee does 
not tie us down very much, as we can make our 
solution about as we like.
Mr. Campbells problem, a mausoleum in a retain
ing wall along a driveway, is a neat one, calling for 
simplicity and impressiveness.
We ought to be proud that our instructors have 
been thus honored by the Beaux Arts Society, and 
we ought to stand right behind them, making them 
proud of our solutions to their problems. At the 
next judgment every man ought to get a mention 
for their honor as well as his own.
There is a very fine exhibit of masterpieces of 
line engraving at the Institute, lasting until the 
eighteenth of this month. Mr. Balken has been 12 
years getting this collection together. It is rarely 
that the public is allowed to see such a fine col
lection, and every one ought to avail himself of the 
opportunity. Owing to the invention of photography 
line engraving has ceased to be in the best sense 
of the word. This is due to the great time and 
infinite trouble required to make a plate. The 
plates from which some of these engravings in the 
exhibit were struck off took the artist six years to 
make.
On Friday last the School of Applied Design had 
a meeting for the purpose of electing a captain for 
its football team, of setting the time for a smoker, 
and by determining who should wear the red caps. 
Hatcher was elected captain and immediately called 
for candidates. That afternoon a fine bunch turned 
out and there is every hope for a good team. Our 
men are heavy and, with some good practice, ought 
to beat the other schools teams.
Monday evening, the 8th, was chosen for the 
smoker, so that Mr. Hornbostel could be persent.
TELL OUR ADVERTISERS
The committee consisted of Shepherd, Smith and 
James.
The discussion on the cap question was long and 
winded. After much useless hot air had been given 
off, it was decided that first-year Plebes should wear 
the caps until Christmas.
Advice for Bis King: Stop, look and listen before 
speaking in the drafting room.
TECH NIGHT AT THE ALVIN.
The Second Tech Night Very Successful.
Saturday night, the second Tech night of the year, 
was pulled off at the Alvin theatre. It was a highly 
successful affair and was a fitting climax to the vic
tory that our team achieved over Franklin & Marshall 
College in the afternoon. As was the case at the 
Nixon the week before, both teams were in the boxes, 
F. & M. having the right and Tech the left side of 
the house. The theatre was decorated with flags of 
the two colleges.
Miss Ring was very successful in making every
body feel happy and was called upon for encores to 
her songs time after time. She had the whole house 
singing with her and appeared to be having as good 
a time as the audience certainly was getting. The 
whole affair was a huge success and let us hope that 
during the coming year we may have many more 
such chances to get together and whoop it up.

HAPPENINGS ELSEWHERE
On account of the failure of last years team and 
the utter lack of interest in a schedule for the com
ing year, the athletic board of the Ohio State Uni
versity has decided to drop intercollegiate baseball 
for the coming year.
The preliminary scraps between the two lower 
classes at Indiana University have begun and it is 
said the vicinity of the campus has taken on the ap
pearance of a barber shop. Almost as many sopho
mores as freshmen have been forced to submit to 
losing their curly locks. The annual class rush, how
ever, does not come until Washingtons birthday an
niversary.
John Bergensen, a junior in Connecticut State Col
lege and amateur hypnotist, after hypnotizing Burton 
White, a classmate, tried in vain for 14 hours to re
move the hypnotic spell. A physician was finally 
called and with great difficulty restored White to his 
senses.

Purdue is now without a football coach, owing to 
the resignation of Dr. Speik. The Athletic Board 
asked for the resignation of the coach as they felt 
that the defeats by Chicago and the poor showing 
against Northwestern were sufficient causes for such 
action.
The youngest man in the Freshman Class of Har

At Illinois the track men who have won the varsity 
letter two years in succession are awarded a blanket

Washington University has invented something 
new in underclass flag rushes. A pennant put in a 
box is buried one foot underground and the place 
marked out by chalk. At a given signal the Fresh
men rush in to dig up the flag, resisted by the waiting 
1912 men, and if the box is lifted above the ground 
the Freshmen win. Ropes, pick-axes and shovels are 
tabooed.

A SPECIAL TRAIN TO MARIETTA
The Only Chance to Accompany the Team out of 
T own.
A special train has been secured to take the team 
and the faithful to Marietta on Saturday. The train 
will probably leave the B. & O. station at about 8 
oclock and will arrive at Marietta at about 11. This 
is the only chance of the year to accompany your 
team out of town, as it is not expected that enough 
will go to Meadville to warrant the ordering of an
other special.
Manager Bright expects to take a squad of twenty 
men along and they will all leave on the special on 
Saturday morning. The team came out of the rough 
F. & M. game in good condition and will be ready to 
show the Ohio crowd how we play football. This 
will also be the only chance that we shall have to 
compare Pitts strength to ours. Early in the sea
son Pitt beat Marietta 10 to 0. Comparative scores 
count for very little, however, as is well shown by 
the fact that Marietta held West Virginia to 3 points, 
and West Virginia and Pitt played a 0 to 0 game 
last Saturday. A battle royal is under any circum
stances assured to those who go along, and no one 
need feel that he wont get his moneys worth.
The cost of the round trip will be $4.45. In order to 
get this reduced rate and the special train it will be 
necessary of at least 100 men to sign up before Wed
nesday night, or Thursday morning at the very latest. 
Manager Bright hopes to have many more than the 
required number and the team surely deserves it. If 
you can possibly go, hand your name in to Manager 
Bright, or his assistants, Stone and Knapp, and as
sure the team of good support in its first trip into 
foreign territory.
THE NEW CLUB HOUSE.
Until larger and more adequate quarters can be 
provided, Director Hamerschlag authorizes the an
nouncement that the schools will extend to the stu
dent body the use of the wooden building on Woodlawn avenue as a general club house for all three 
schools.
This building was formerly used by the Construc
tion Department. As it is provided with heat, light 
and sanitary facilities it is ready for immediate occu
pancy. Its several rooms, with some slight partition 
changes, would furnish suitable office space for the 
various student activities, as well as provide one 
large room for common use both day and evening.
Further details in regard to the management and 
running of the house will be announced in next 
weeks issue of The Tartan.

THE TARTAN15
COVER COMPETITION CLOSED.
The grand competition held by The Tartan for a 
new design for the cover came to a close when the 
first prize of $10 was awarded to Miss Elanor Tener, of 
the School of Applied Design, and honorable mention 
made of the work of Miss Louise Miller and Carson, 
of the Illustrators. The jury, consisting of Dean McGoodwin and Messrs. Sparks, Ferrand and Hewlett, to
gether with the editors of this paper, met on Friday 
afternoon and after spending several hours pondering 
over the drawings were able, by the fine discrimina
tive powers of M. Ferrand, to make the award and 
not disperse after a disagreement. The readers of 
this paper (including the members of the faculty who 
have not come up for their subscriptions) may feel 
assured that for the first time since its foundation, 
The Tartan will henceforth appear clad in the glory 
of a true work of art. It was impossible for the 
artist to complete all of the lettering in time to have 
the engravers work finished so it could be used this 
issue, but it will appear shortly.

All bid him good-bye,
For his loyalty makes him 
A popular guy.

Whose spirit runs high,
Who determines to make it 
With finances shy.

As hes hugging the roofs 
Of passenger trains.

His lot is no snap,
For, cold, sad, and hungry,
He has to bum back.
