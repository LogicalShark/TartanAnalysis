EXTRA
Volume 67, Number 1Wednesday, September 6, 1967President H. G. Stever Welcomes You...
The CMU Tartans, who dont 
play their first game until Sept. 
23 at Wooster, have been un
dergoing preseason drills since 
Aug. 28. The Tartans will be 
I coming into this season with 
I what may very well be the 
strongest team since the 1959 
 'squad, which finished with a 7-1 
record. Last year, the Tartans 
were 5-3 and will be bringing 
nearly the same team into this 
season, having lost only six 
players to graduation.
Leading the list of outstand
ing returning players is Larry 
Getto, last seasons most valu
able player. Getto goes after 
^ Tartan opponents both ways. 
On the offensive unit, he plays 
fullback and, on defense, he 
holds down one of the lineback
erpositions. Another returning 
veteran of the offensive unit is 
senior quarterback Tom Hubka. 
Hubkas sharp passes last year, 
coupled with the hard running 
attack, gave the Tartans a two 
^fisted attack that was hard to 
stop. Senior flankerback Dick 
Bell, Hubkas favorite receiver, 
will also be back. The halfback 
position will be once again filled 
by senior Chalres Zak and Jun
ior Ken Batorski. The end pos
ition should be filled by Tony 
Bugel and John Barnes.
In addition to the returning
& veterans, there  is a crop of 
strong freshman, a few of 
which have a chance of break
ing into the starting line-up 
before the Wooster game. The 
Tartans defeated Wooster last 
year in the season opener by a 
score of 18-6, and would like 
nothing better than to start this 
season off on the same winning 
note.
$ The other varsity fall sport 
is cross country. The harriers, 
now led by junior Bernie Flynn, 
had a perfect 9-0 record last 
season, with their big win com
ing against Waynesburg, who 
had the year before broken the 
Tartan's 3-year, 24 meet unde
feated streak. Having lost two 
of their top three runners to 
graduation, the Tartans are 
counting on the Freshmen team 
members to fill this gap and 
help keep up the cross country 
teams tradition of winning.
Welcome from The TARTAN, Too
You will, no doubt, be welcom
ed to Carnegie - Mellon many 
times in the next few weeks. 
This issue of the Tartan is our 
way of giving you our welcome, 
which we hope will be informa
tive as well as friendly.
It is also meant to introduce 
you to our campus newspaper, 
and the publications network as 
a whole. Here at Camegie-Mellon, the student body actively 
participates in the Thistle, our 
yearbook, the Technical, a na
tionally distributed magazine 
written and produced by CMU 
people, WRCT, the campus radio 
station, Patterns, our literary 
magazine, and, last but not 
least, the Tartan, our own pub
lication, which is published week
ly, with the help of student staf
fers, faculty contributors, and, 
at times, the grace of God.

ment, in cooperation with the
