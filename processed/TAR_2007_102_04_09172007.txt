Beyond campus politics: CMU celebrates Constitution
by Sabrina Porter
Assistant News Editor
Today, the original Bill of 
Rights and a Court of Appeals 
judge, Thomas Hardiman, ar
rived on campus in honor of 
Carnegie Mellons third annual 
Constitution Day celebration. 
The keynote speaker, Bill of 
Rights display, and an array of 
other educational materials will 
be available in the Posner Cen
ter, home to the Tepper School of 
Business, for the university com
munity to enjoy.
This year we are fortunate to 
have a U.S. Judge from the Third 
Circuit Court of Appeals, Thomas
Hardiman, participating in our 
celebration, said Holly Hippensteel, director of the Student Life 
Office.
Judge Hardiman will lead a 
discussion about the Constitu
tion today and the nature of the 
constitution as a living docu
ment.
Hardiman was recommended 
as a possible keynote speaker by 
a member of the Carnegie Mel
lon faculty.
He has experience in the Su
preme Court, appeals circuit, 
and tax court, in addition to 
Big Brothers Big Sisters of Pitts
burgh, Inc. His expertise in the 
area of constitutional law and 
in its daily implications is well
known and respected.
Hardiman will be speaking at 
the Posner Center at 5:30 p.m.
An original copy of the Bill of 
Rights, one of only four in the 
nation, is also available for view
ing at the Posner Center.
Thomas Jefferson gave two 
copies of the document to each 
governor of all fourteen states 
when it was written in 1792. Of 
these copies, only four remain. 
Carnegie Mellons original 
edition, a part of the Posner 
collection, is currently on per
manent loan to the university 
from the Posner family.
The Posner collection was 
established in 1978 by Henry 
Posner and his wife, Ida. The
Bill of Rights is one of the most 
well-known documents in the 
collection, which also includes 
a facsimile of the Gutenberg 
Bible and important Einstein 
offprints.
For Posner, the primary value 
of his collection was having care
fully built a library for his family 
an archive that represented the 
best in ideas, sciences and the 
arts.
The Bill of Rights, although 
only on display until 4 p.m. 
tomorrow, is available to the 
university community yearround in digital form at http:// 
posner.library. cm u. edu/Posner.
I think its great that we have 
such an original and important
document in our possession, 
said Joey Cordes, a sophomore 
design major.
It says a lot for our school that 
we have the Bill of Rights to dis
play and fully commemorate a 
really important day.
For many, Constitution Day is 
a new concept.
I didnt even know there was 
a Constitution Day, said Lydia 
Remington, a sophomore public 
policy and management major. 
Not that it isnt important, but 
I didnt think we actually cel
ebrated the Constitution at a 
certain time every year.

The number of Carnegie Mel
lon graduates who apply to Teach 
for America is on the rise. This 
year, 36 members of the class 
of 2007 applied, a 57 percent 
increase in applications since 
2006, according to a report is
sued by Teach For America.
Teach For America is a pro
gram that places graduates from 
some of the nations top colleges 
and universities in two-year 
teaching positions in some of the 
nations poorest school districts 
in the hopes of eliminating the 
achievement gap in this country.
Teach For America realized 
that to change on a broader level, 
they had to focus on recruitment 
and increasing the number of 
campus representatives, said 
Bill Thompson, who graduated 
from Carnegie Mellon in 2001 
with a B.A. in business adminis
tration. Thompson participated 
in the program from 2001 to 
2004 and served as one of Teach 
For Americas recruitment direc
tors from 2004 to 2005.
Since 2003, the number of 
applicants from Carnegie Mel
lon has steadily increased. In 
2003-2004,16 students applied; 
in 2004-2005, 21 students ap
plied; and in 2006, 23 students 
applied.
Eleven members of Carnegie 
Mellons class of 2007 are cur
rently serving their first year in 
the program.
To make the necessary 
fundamental changes in our 
educational system, we need 
to attack [educational ineq
uity] from all sectors, said Ian 
Stormont, Teach For America 
recruitment director for the 
Pittsburgh region.
Teach For America was
MU grads 
go back to 
school
founded in 1990 by Wendy Kopp, 
a student at Princeton Univer
sity, as a senior thesis project. 
Kopp raised $2.5 million to place 
500 college graduates in teach
ing positions in the schools of six 
low-income communities.
Today, Teach For America has 
a network of over 5000 teachers 
in 26 areas. This past year, over 
19,000 college graduates ap
plied nationwide and just over 
3000 were accepted. Teach For 
America also now receives some 
federal funding and support from 
foundations and local donors.
By 2010, Teach For America 
plans to have 7500 corps mem
bers in 33 placement sites. Next 
year, the program plans to open 
placement sites in Indianapolis, 
Ind. and Kansas City, Mo.
Teach For America requires 
members to attend a five-week 
teacher boot camp, which pre
pares members for the situations 
they may encounter while teach
ing. Once members complete the 
program, school districts are al
lowed to grant them temporary 
teaching certificates. Corps mem
bers are hired as any teacher in 
their particular district would be; 
they are interviewed and placed 
where their specialty is needed 
most. Teach For America corps 
members are paid by the school 
district they work for and receive 
the same salary and benefits as 
other beginning teachers.
Members make from $25,000 
to $44,000 per year.
The intensity level of the 
program leads 10-15 percent 
of members to drop out before 
completing their two-year term, 
according to a 2006 article in 
Newsweek. Those who dropped 
the program described not receiv
ing enough support from either 
their school or from Teach For 
America, feeling overwhelmed 
by the challenge, or having trou
ble managing the classroom, the 
article stated.
Though difficult for some,

The events of Orientation week

the Clippership Cruise  not 
the theft of thousands of dollars 
worth of university property. But 
this year, a substantial amount of 
equipment belonging to AB Tech 
was stolen from the Orientation
tent sometime between 11 p.m. 
Wednesday, Aug. 22, and 5 a.m. 
Thursday, Aug. 23.
University Police believe mul
tiple people were involved in 
the theft, although they do not 
currently have any suspects, 
according to University Police 
Lieutenant John Race.
One of the items, a drive unit 
used to control sound during 
events, was large enough to have 
required two people as well as a
vehicle to transport it, leading 
police to believe that the opera
tion had been planned.
University Police would not 
release the exact dollar amount 
of the value of the missing equip
ment, but according to Race, 
several thousands of dollars; 
worth of equipment was taken 
in various forms of electronic 
devices, such as microphones.
Whoever took the [mics] 
knew what they were doing, said
Matt Williamson, co-chair of AB 
Tech and a senior in computer 
science and human-computer 
interaction.
Lower-quality microphones 
were left behind, Williamson 
said, while microphones worth 
more were taken.
All of the equipment that was 
stolen was engraved or other
wise marked with AB Tech, 
and the driver unit was con
tained within a purple case.
Although AB Tech still has 
enough equipment to run 
smaller shows, larger events  
such as Greek Sing  will re
quire the organization to either 
rent equipment or purchase new 
equipment to fill in the gaps in 
its inventory.
Despite the equipment prob
lems, Williamson remains 
positive.
The concerts will happen as 
planned, he said.

Mentor pro
gram still 
going Strong
by StutiPandey
Junior Staffwriter
Now in its second year, 
membership in the campus men
toring program Strong Women, 
Strong Girls has already more 
than tripled, from last years 
eight mentors to this years 25.
The program is under the 
leadership of Grace DeForest, a 
senior operations research and 
statistics major, and Breanna 
Zwart, a senior majoring in in
ternational relations and direct
ing.
The programs mission, ac
cording to its website, is to cre
ate communities of strong and 
successful women today, and 
supporting the strong and suc
cessful women of tomorrow.
The mission statement ap
pealed to first-year economics 
major Destiny Ridguard, who 
decided to apply to the program 
this year.
I think its interesting that we 
get to work in tandem with other 
female CMU students working 
towards a similar goal of em
powerment, Ridguard said.
Strong Women, Strong Girls 
was founded in 2000 by Lindsay 
Hyde, a student at Harvard Uni
versity. The program arrived at 
Carnegie Mellon through Linda 
Babcock of the Heinz School, 
who served on its board of direc
tors in Boston in the spring of the 
2005-2006 school year.
Carnegie Mellon is the first 
university outside of Boston to 
offer the program.
This year, the program will fo
cus on decreasing violence.
There is a rise in violence in 
Pittsburgh community. There
fore, we need to bring strong 
women to speak to the girls, 
DeForest said.
The program targets girls 
from grades three to five who 
live in at-risk and low-income 
communities, which are par
ticularly prone to violence, the 
leaders said.
In the spring semester, Strong 
Women, Strong Girls will study 
the history of violence in com
munities nearby and the female 
role models who have made an 
impact on decreasing violence 
throughout the world.
The program was also wellsuited to Pittsburgh, DeForest 
and Zwart said, because Pitts
burghs demographics show -a 
great discrepancy in the ratio 
of males to females, much like 
Carnegie Mellons campus.
Last year, the program con
sisted of eight mentors who 
worked with about 25 girls 
in a group tutoring format. 
This year, Zwart and DeForest 
have recruited 25 mentors and 
about 100 girls at four differ
ent elementary schools around 
Pittsburgh.
Strong Women, Strong Girls 
uses a set curriculum to teach 
the girls skills that they need to 
succeed.
Such skills include commu
nication, critical thinking and 
leadership. To accomplish this, 
they engage in negotiation 
workshops and other activities 
to strengthen interpersonal 
skills, while simultaneously 
helping the girls with their 
homework.
We believe strongly that in
creasing self esteem and having 
a stronger base will help them in 
future years, Zwart said.
Both leaders highlighted the 
strides the program has already 
made in a short amount of time.
SWSG has made such an 
impact on certain elementary 
school campuses that parents

Strong Women, Strong Girls offers encouragement for young girls

age mentors as well.
We each get older members 
to mentor us, and that was one 
of the best aspects of the pro 
gram, Ridguard said.
The program model relies or

We are also growing ourselves 
as leaders, Zwart said.
To achieve this, the girls whc 
participate in the program ai 
a college level even have theii 
own mentors that are business
women who are willing to give 
their time to mentor us and help 
us.
All women who become men 
tors to the college community 
have been through leadership 
training themselves, and have 
been specially selected for the 
program.
As they enter their seconc

mindful of the programs qrigi

otherwise get the chance to full) 
reach their potential.
To tell a girl that she is spe

weekly basis to look into whai 
she is doing and what interests 
her is profound, DeForest said.

daughters are not a part of the 
program, Zwart said.
I recently received an e-mail 
from a parent [of a girl in last 
years program] who was un
sure about the program and 
whether it was a good idea for her 
daughter, DeForest said. This 
summer, I took her daughter to 
a press conference for Senator 
[Arlen] Specter [R-Pa.]. It made 
such an impact on the little girl 
and the .mother that the mother 
wanted to let me know how much 
the girl had changed throughout 
the year.
Though, like most programs, 
Strong Women, Strong Girls does 
encounter an obstacle that is fa
miliar to many other involved 
students at Carnegie Mellon.
As a Carnegie Mellon student, 
you are always busy, Zwart 
said. It is hard to find a person 
who will be committed and con
sistent. Four to five hours doesnt 
seem a lot, but to consistently do 
it is the hardest thing. You arent 
hurting our feelings when you 
dont show up, you are hurting 
the girls.

This years focus on the living,,

many teachers succeed in their 
classrooms, according to Teach 
For America Recruitment Asso
ciate Cailin McDuff.
Corps members know that 
this will be a challenging ex
perience, but when they make 
significant strides with their 
students in the classroom while 
they themselves are gaining 
valuable leadership experience, 
they know its worth it, McDuff 
said.
Stormont agreed.
We currently have 5000 core 
members in classrooms and over 
12,000 alumni. For the most 
part there is an overwhelmingly 
high satisfaction rate, but when
ever you have so many people 
involved in something there are 
bound to be a few negative ex
periences; unfortunately, those 
are the ones that get press, 
Stormont said.
While some criticize Teach 
For America for providing 
only a temporary solution to a 
long-term problem, Teach For 
America has a different long
term approach. Their intentions 
are that alumni will go out into 
various fields and spread the 
message of Teach For America 
as advocates for the eliminar 
tion of educational inequality in 
America.
This year, Teach For America 
was named one of the 20 great

Community Relations Coordina
tor Jim Struzzi.
Together with the new south

should drastically improve 
traffic flow through this area, 
Struzzi said, which is the main 
connection between downtown 
Pittsburgh and Oakland. To boot, 
Struzzi said the area will also be 
more aestheticallypleasing when 
the project is completed.
The expected completion date 
for the project is May 1,2009, ac

is running on schedule, and both 
Struzzi and Zang estimate that if 
it continues to progress the way 
it has, construction will most 
likely finish on time.
In the meantime, drivers can 
expect various detours and traffic
restrictions throughout the area, 
including tapering traffic on 
Forbes Avenue to two lanes.
Some students who have sat 
through traffic jams on the sites 
of other bridge renovations 
are ambivalent about driving 
through the construction zone.
Hopefully, this will be less in
convenient than the Homestead 
Grays Bridge construction, Hallinen said. 
Work on the Grays Bridge, 
which goes to the Waterfront, 
began in 2006 and is still 
underway.
Eventually, all traffic across 
the boulevard bridge will be de
toured elsewhere so the structure 
can be replaced.
The main thing that people 
need to know is that the bridge 
will not be taken out of commis
sion until early 2008, Struzzi 
said.
For now, though, the bridge 
will remain in use.
Construction has begun on 
Pittsburghs Boulevard of the 
Allies Bridge, one of nearly 
6000 Pennsylvania bridges that 
state-certified bridge inspectors 
deemed structurally deficient, 
the same term used to describe 
the 1-3 5 W Mississippi River 
Bridge that collapsed in Minne
apolis this summer.
A structurally deficient bridge 
is safe to drive over, but needs 
costly repairs to bring it up to 
current standards, said Jason 
Zang, assistant bridge engineer 
for the Pennsylvania Department 
of Transportation (PennDOT).
Structurally deficient bridges 
often have restrictions such 
as weight limits. The existing

Radio uses only a portion of 
the electromagnetic spectrum, 
but it allows people to com
municate with one another, 
experience visual and audio 
entertainment, and even explore 
outer space.-
A radio wave consists of two 
perpendicular sine waves that 
are formed by electric and mag
netic fields. One of the waves is a 
changing electric field, while the 
other wave is a changing mag
netic field.
Radio signals are made unique 
by the frequency of their sine 
waves, or the number of cycles 
that oscillate per unit of time. 
Frequency is often measured in 
hertz, or cycles per second.
In comparison to the rest of the 
electromagnetic spectrum, radio 
waves have low frequencies, usu
ally between one million and one' 
billion hertz. Visible light, on the 
other hand, has a frequency of 
one quadrillion hertz.
Within the radio spectrum, dif
ferent frequencies of radio waves 
are used for different purposes. 
FM radio, for instance, detects 
radio waves with frequencies 
between 88 and 108 megahertz, 
while cell phones use radio 
waves with frequencies between 
824 and 849 megahertz.
A radio is a device that trans
mits andreceives electromagnetic 
waves that fall within the radio 
spectrum. To send and receive 
signals, a radio uses a transmit
ter and receiver, respectively.
The transmitter sends the 
electromagnetic wave into the 
air by moving electrical current 
up and down an antenna. When 
current fluctuates in an anten
na, it creates changing electric 
and magnetic fields that travel 
together as a radio wave.
The signal is first sent into the 
air. Then the transmitter imparts

Professor accepts challenge 
to put a robot on the moon
by Michael M. Whiston
Science & Technology Editor
The broadcast of the Apollo 11 
crew landing on the moon has come 
to symbolize U.S. space exploration. 
But with the aid of Carnegie Mellons 
cutting-edge technology, the next 
explorer to land on the moon might 
be a robot.
The Google-sponsored X PRIZE 
Foundation is holding a $20 million 
challenge to land a functioning ro
bot on the moon within the next five 
years, and Carnegie Mellon is step
ping up to the plate.
R.obotics professor William Red 
Whittaker is heading up the univer
sitys moon prize team, which is set 
to include students, staff, volunteers, 
investors, research institutions, com
panies, and other talent outside of 
Carnegie Mellon.
Whittaker, who is also the direc
tor of the Field Robotics Center, said 
that the team will need to design a 
robot that is large enough to handle 
the lunar terrain but light enough to 
launch from Earth and land on the 
moon.
Any additional kilogram adds 
a lot to the weight that you have to 
launch, said John Thornton, a grad
uate student in mechanical engineer
ing who is working with Whittaker 
on the project.
Thornton said that one of the first 
steps in the project is deciding on 
the robots mass. It definitely turns 
into a very large optimization prob
lem on the mass side of things.
To win the competition, the robot 
must traverse the moons surface for 
500 meters and send a mooncast, 
or data package, back to Earth. The 
mooncast must include high-resolution photographs and high-definition 
video.
The winning team will receive $20 
million, and the second-place team
will take home $5 million.
During preparation, Whittakers 
team will focus on how to launch the 
rover from Earth to the moon and 
how to communicate digital infor
mation back to Earth.
The team will also prepare the 
robot for harsh environmental 
conditions on the moon.
According to Thornton, the robot 
will be operational on the moon for 
about 10 days.
At night, lunar temperatures can 
fall below -325F; during the day, 
they can top 212F.

Carnegie Mellons Entertainment Tech
nology Center (ETC) will be partnering 
with Harrisburg University of Science and 
Technology and the Technology Council of 
Central Pennsylvania (TCCP) this semes
ter to form a new center aimed at training 
people for technology-based jobs.
The new facility, called the Center for 
Advanced Entertainment & Learning 
Technologies (CAELT), will gear students
toward careers in the global economy, par
ticularly in the rapidly merging fields of 
fine arts and computer science.
This partnership announcement is a 
perfect example of the substantial results 
that can be achieved when outstanding 
organizations work together, and it is 
the kind of partnership that Harrisburg 
University was created to undertake, 
Harrisburg Mayor Stephen Reed told ETC.
Students in the center will be expected 
to work on various new technologies that 
will further education and support the 
economy.
Don Marinelli, executive producer of 
the ETC and a professor of drama and arts 
management at CMU, statedin a Harris
burg University press release, Not only 
do we develop and implement new tech
nologies, we also seek out new approaches 
to education and pedagogy. Harrisburg 
University and the Technology Council of 
Central Pennsylvania, have shown them
selves to be willing early adopters of new 
technologies. That is what makes this part
nership so exciting.
' They are placing Harrisburg and Cen
tral Pennsylvania on the cutting edge of
new technology implementation that may 
impact American education in truly signifi
cant ways.
Students and faculty at the new facility 
will begin work on several projects this 
semester, including designing an intern
ship interviewing program for TCCPs

How Things Work: Radio
information to a radio wave by 
modifying various properties of 
the wave. The process of impart
ing data to a radio signal is called 
modulation.
There are three types of mod
ulation: pulse, amplitude, and 
frequency. Pulse modulation 
 (PM) occurs when a radio signal 
is turned on and off. This kind of 
modulation is used to transmit 
information to radio-controlled 
clocks in the U.S.
Amplitude modulation (AM), 
on the other hand, varies the am
plitude (maxima and minima) of 
the sine wave. This type of mod
ulation can be used to transmit a 
radio host's voice.
Lastly, frequency modulation(FM) alters the frequency of the 
sine wave. This type of modula
tion is often used to transmit 
music because it delivers mini
mal static.
The electromagnetic wave 
is transmitted through the air 
at the speed of light. When it 
reaches the receivers antenna, 
the fluctuating electric field
moves charges up and down in 
the receivers antenna, and the 
radio picks up the signal.
After the transmitter sends the 
modulated sine wave, the receiv
er picks up the radio signal using 
an antenna. The tuner picks out 
the particular signal based on 
frequency, and it amplifies this 
frequency for the speakers to 
output.
While radio waves are com
monly associated with car radios 
and boom boxes, they are also 
used by televisions, cell phones,
and satellites.
Television uses radio waves 
to transmit visual information. 
On older televisions, antennas 
receive radio signals from tele
vision stations and then display 
the image on the screen.
In the case of cable television, 
however, cable companies re
ceive the radio signals from the 
television stations and transmit 
this information via a cable to 
peoples personal televisions.
Cell phones are also radios. 
They have built-in antennas that 
allow people to transmit and 
receive information when they 
talk with one another.
In particular, when a person 
speaks into the phone, that in
formation is transmitted to a 
cell phone tower as radio waves. 
The information then travels to 
the other person through a cell 
phone network.
In astronomy, radio telescopes 
are used to detect radio waves 
that are emitted from objects 
in space. Planets, for instance, 
give off radio waves through 
thermal radiation, as do gases 
around stars through molecular 
changes. Radio telescopes help 
astronomers form images of ob
jects in space based on the radio 
signals that they emit.
Creating radio signals on 
Earth, on the other hand, simply 
requires a battery and conduc
tor.
To create your own radio 
waves, make sporadic contact 
between a coin and the termi
nals of a nine-volt battery. This 
procedure creates a fluctuating 
current through the coin and 
battery.
Depending on the rate of 
fluctuation, this current may 
produce changing electric and 
magnetic fields that constitute 
radio waves. If youre close to 
a radio, you can listen for static 
through the speakers.

how to count to six and under
stood over 100 words.
Before Alex, scientists assumed 
that only apes and dolphins

human resource professionals 
to converse in-depth with a stu
dents virtual self, permitting 
them to ask questions in a con
versational manner  just as 
they would if they were speaking 
to the student face-to-face.
Another project that the col
laborative team will undertake 
this semester is the creation of a 
virtual tour of Harrisburg Uni
versitys new Academic Center, a 
16-story building currently under 
construction.
This project wilj combine game 
creation platforms with Synthetic
Interview technology to allow 
prospective students to virtually 
tour the Academic Center and in
teract with Harrisburg University 
staff and faculty.
Harrisburg University is the 
only private, non-profit, com

universities a similar historical 
background.
With the construction of this

Team designs robot to send photos and video of moon back to Earth
CHALLENGE, fromA6
That temperature difference is brutal 
on any mechanical system, Thornton 
said.
The robots will also be subject to lunar 
dust and high levels of radiation while 
on the moon, inhibiting their function
ality and possibly damaging the robots 
camera sensors.
Whittaker, who is unfazed by such 
challenges, said, For the dust, there are 
seals and brushes that ... keep the dust 
out of bearings and moving parts. As 
for the electronics, There are electron
ics that can endure radiation.
In order for the robot to be able to 
withstand the moons chilling nighttime 
temperatures, the team might design it 
to travel westward on the lunar surface. 
This kind of movement is called sun
synchrony, and it would require the ro
bot to set its own path without help from 
Earth during certain parts of the trip.
That way, youre always in the light, 
and instead of having to design for hot 
and cold, you can bask in the sunlight 
and get a lot of solar energy, Whittaker 
said.
Whittaker said that the teams robot 
will probably run on solar power.
As a general principle, Whittaker said, 
the team will not build parts of the robot 
that can be readily purchased.
There might be 60 percent of a sys
tem like this that can be acquired, he. 
said. Its the important 40 percent 
where you have to design and build the 
parts, create the electronics, and get the 
power systems.
Whittaker said that the team will need 
to develop software to control the rovers
sensor systems, which include lasers, 
cameras, and radars.
Its definitely not anything that CMU 
cant handle,- Thornton said.
The software must also ensure that the 
robot lands on the moon safely. Because 
there is no atmosphere surrounding the 
moon, the rover cannot use a parachute 
to land.
Instead, the robot will use small rock
ets that are controlled by the systems 
software. ,
Once it is safely on the surface, soft
ware will enable the robot to send 
high-quality images back to Earth, 
perhaps through a continuous cycle 
of stopping, pointing its antenna, and 
transmitting data.
The software has to be very special 
to do that right, Whittaker said. It is the 
real crux of landing, driving, and deal
ing with the unknown and sending back 
the data.
According to the Carnegie Mellon 
Moon Prize website, there are a number 
of different sponsorship possibilities for 
the. moon rover. One is to have a reality 
television program in which people com
pete to become the first amateur driver 
of the rover. The team is also consider
ing the possibility of making the robot 
into a web host, capable of sending im
ages in e-mails to online users.
Speaking of the challenge, Thornton 
said, Its a chance of a lifetime. 
According to Googles Lunar X PRIZE 
website, the space mission also opens up 
the possibility of using natural resources 
from the moon on Earth.
The Google Lunar X PRIZE website 
stated that the moon is a source of 
solutions to some of the most pressing
environmental problems that we face on 
the Earth.
In particular, if the X PRIZE challenge 
is successful, robots may be able to pin
point the location of crater ice on the 
moon. Crater ice can be used as fuel for 
spaceships, thereby decreasing the cost 
of space missions.
The moon also contains helium-3, 
which can be used as a low-radiation 
fuel in nuclear fusion reactions. In the 
future, robots may be able to transport 
helium-3 to Earth.
Lunar substance from the moon can 
also be used to construct solar devices 
that can be sent into space. These de
vices would be capable of sending solar 
energy from space to Earth during night. 
This energy could be used to charge 
electric cars and produce synthetic fuel 
on Earth.

Pittsburgh is older, wiser
Pittsburgh is an old town. Not just be
cause its been a century since steel mills 
and Andrew Carnegie ruled the city, but 
because the proportion of the Pittsburgh 
population that is age 65 or older is al
most 5 percent higher than the national 
average. Pair that with Pittsburghs no
torious brain drain and you have a city 
that seems well on its way to becoming 
a ghost town.
However, there are advantages to 
having a large, dare we say, elderly pop
ulation. The elderly tend to stay put  
more than twice as many Pittsburghers 
(13.6 percent) have lived in the same
home since 1969 (or earlier) than the 
national average (6.1 percent). For this 
reason, more Pittsburgh residents prob
ably know their neighbors than those in 
cities with higher turnover rates, which 
makes for safer, more tightly knit com
munities. Because of this permanence, 
the elderly are more likely to take a lead
ership role in the community, whether it 
be serving on the board of their place of 
worship, volunteering at the hospital, or 
taking classes at one of the local colleges 
or universities. This translates into more 
money saved, or earned, for the city.
Senior citizens help keep our com
munity safer, richer, and friendlier. 
And while they dont share many char
acteristics with 20-something students, 
together they make up a substantial por
tion of the citys population. However, 
while most students jet off after gradu
ation, seniors take pride in Pittsburgh as 
their permanent home.
Students already benefit Pittsburgh 
by spending money, performing cut
ting-edge research, and volunteering 
for local organizations. As students, we 
should follow the example set by our el
ders by taking an active and permanent 
role in our community.
Presidents email addresses student concerns honestly
So far this semester, the phrase Did 
you hear about the bomb threat? has 
become as commonplace as How about 
that heat? The bomb threats have 
been troubling to students, particularly 
first-years, who might think that such 
security scares are the norm at college
 or at Carnegie Mellon.
In light of this concern, President 
Cohons recent university-wide e-mail 
served to alleviate (at least partially) 
our fears and explain not only whats 
going on, but what Carnegie Mellon is 
doing about it.
The e-mail came on 9/11, a day 
when most of us were probably more 
concerned about safety than ever, 
and began by putting the three recent 
campus bomb threats into some muchneeded context.
Our university is one of several that 
have received the same type of threats, 
sent anonymously by e-mail. Accord
ing to Cohon, no bombs have been 
discovered at any of the targeted uni
versities a fact that should come as a 
relief.
Additionally, Cohon assured us that 
prior to this semester Carnegie Mellon 
had not received a bomb threat for at 
least 10 years.
Cohon'also addressed the recent wa
ter main break, adding that our campus 
may face future water-related emer
gencies and that Carnegie Mellon is 
prepared to handle them.
Perhaps most reassuring was Cohons 
explanation of how the administration 
decides how to handle a threat. Es
sentially, there are two considerations:
safety (the top priority) and quick com
munication.
It helps us as students to understand 
how the administration thinks so that 
we can take advantage of Carnegie Mellons response to security threats as they 
happen.
Lastly, Cohon asked for our participa
tion and feedback. He encouraged stu
dents to sign up for AlertNow (https:// 
my.cmu.edu/site/main/page.alert) and 
to e-mail him or Associate Vice Presi
dent Michael Murphy with comments or 
concerns.
We appreciate our presidents effort 
. to keep us informed and hear our feed
back. Threats to our campus will never 
disappear entirely, but a concerned ad
ministration can help us feel a little bit 
safer.
GaliLead program takes steps toward world peace
The Tartan is proud that Carnegie 
Mellon is on its way to becoming a 
leader in brokering peace in the Middle 
East. Last June, future Arab and Jewish 
leaders came together at Carnegie Mel
lon as part of a new initiative to foster 
positive relations in the Middle East. 
The 21 leaders were first-year fellows in 
the GaliLead Project, a grassroots effort 
to cultivate a new generation of leaders 
for the Galilee region in northern Israel.
Not only was the project aimed at 
reaching out to the global community 
and strengthening Carnegie Mellons 
ties abroad, it was also an interdisciplin
ary program that incorporated faculty 
from the Tepper School  of Business, 
the Heinz School of Public Policy and 
Management, and the department of
psychology. GaliLead focused on both 
leadership training and policy imple
mentation in order to develop a contin
gent of Arab and Israeli students who 
are ready and willing to go back into1* 
Galilee and create social change.
Faculty experts in psychology, orga
nizational behavior, and performance 
effectiveness advised the students on 
how best to forestall further conflict and 
promote community building. The stu
dents hope that their projects and ideas 
will generate more interest in the Gali
Lead and other community-change 
projects.
GaliLead is not the first time that 
enterprising Carnegie Mellon faculty 
and students have tried to tackle the 
ongoing troubles between Israel and
Palestine. Two years ago, the Enter
tainment Technology Center launched 
the groundbreaking PeaceMaker video 
game.
PeaceMaker, aimed specifically at Arab 
and Isreali teenagers, allowed players to 
choose between the role of Israeli prime 
minister and Palestinian president so 
that they could get a better understand
ing of how the peace process can work. 
It used the same basic format as violent 
strategy games to show that peace can 
be just as challenging as violence.
GaliLead and PeaceMaker, while two 
drastically different projects, demon
strate that this university is acutely aware 
of global conflict and is committed, 
through creative and interdisciplinary 
means, to being part of the solution.
Marketing ploys commodify 
green technology for profit
Jessica Thurston
With todays increased social and po
litical pressures guiding our patterns 
of consumption, were often inundated 
with contradictions in the marketing of 
products  marketing contradictions 
that mimic the contradictions we per
petuate by aiming to define ourselves 
as individuals by consuming mass-pro
duced items.
Commercials celebrate green 
printer inks, low-carb muffins, and 
organic scented lotions. While these 
examples of such contradictions are 
often harmless and may even lead to 
eventual change for the better, the how 
to go green trend becomes dangerous 
when truly non-green, perilously ecounfriendly products are allowed to 
market themselves as safe for the envi
ronment. This is what is happening as 
coal used for energy in Pennsylvania is 
marketing new coal-burning processes 
as clean energy solutions  though 
in reality the processes may still release 
greenhouse gases and water pollutants 
in our own state.
k Green (read: slightly reformed) tech
nologies manifest themselves in such 
far-fetched products as organic scented 
lotions and recycled gold earrings. 
InStyle.com describes the latter in its 
section on green products: These deli
cate Gingkos have an earthy feel perfect 
for both summers sundresses and falls
nys revenue. Besides the fact that the 
wording is carefully constructed as to 
say that corn is an ingredient  among 
what else? How eco-friendly can ink re
ally be?
The companys website also empha
sized that the ink is recognized by the 
FDA, and seems to use this fact to plug 
their product as wholly environmen
tally friendly. It seems like once the FDA 
or USDA or WTF-A approves, we can all 
breathe a sigh of relief and believe that 
somehow, in some way, were reducing 
our ecological impact on the earth. But 
the regulations that are met to receive 
such seals of approval are not necessar
ily the be-all-and-end-all of standards 
set for eco-friendly lifestyles. There'is 
more to do, and using printer solvent ink 
that is recognized by the EPA is not, by 
any means, enough to reduce our impact 
on the earth and attempt to reverse the 
effects of global warming. Living ecofriendly is not just about slowing down 
or even stopping our current trends of 
global warming, but rather, to attempt 
to reverse the incredible damage weve 
already done.
The most perilous and note-worthy 
marketing contradiction of them all, 
though, is the clean coal power plants 
(Integrated Gasification Combined Cy
cle, or IGCC). I hope that the irony of 
this idea is extraordinarily obvious. First 
of all, using coal for energy is innately 
non-clean, and should in no way be al
lowed to disguise itself as any sort of 
green technology. Moreover, when such 
a product labels itself as eco-friendly
Green (read: slightly reformed) technologies mani

organic scented lotions and recycled gold earrings.
cozy knits. As much as wearing these 
stylish jewels might satisfy the In Style 
reader searching for his or her own way 
to contribute to the trendy fight against 
global warming, an earthy feel wont 
do much to save polar bears. What 
should be celebrated, though, is the fact 
that the gold used in the earrings is re
cycled  and any step toward reducing 
our global footprint is a good one. Un
fortunately, this is not the aspect of the 
product that is highlighted by InStyle. 
com as that which makes it a must-have 
item. Nonetheless, if this is how a par
ticular audience is going to understand 
respecting the environment, then it is 
all well and good.
Its easy to dismiss these products 
marketing contradictions as harmless, 
which, as in the previous case, they are. 
But masking the truly damaging charac
teristics of a product is not okay  and 
should be stopped  when those char
acteristics are damaging the environ
ment, and the companies producing the 
goods are slipping under the go green 
trends radar.
VUTEks Bio-Solvent Inks, for ex
ample, are the next generation of envi
ronmentally friendly inks made with a 
renewable resource  corn. As this is 
close to the only data on the companys 
website that details  or rather, loosely 
coverswhat makes these inks suppos
edly environmentally friendly, it seems 
clear that the company is substantially 
more interested in creating this alleg
edly green product to draw in more 
business (for both the environmentally 
friendly inks and their not-so-friendly 
counterparts) than to really benefit the 
environment. However, any step toward 
reducing the effects of global warming 
is better than nothing  unless a prod
uct is really not eco-friendly but is being 
disguised as such to increase a compaby adopting the go green trend (like 
a set of recycled gold earrings or Or
ganic cotton area rugs), it assumes the 
power to get away with more horribly 
damaging ecological practices. IGCC 
plants are supposedly able to capture 
carbon dioxide, the damaging chemical 
emitted from plants, by reducing plant 
efficiency and increasing water use. 
Producing contaminated water and a 
buildup of carbon dioxide  the process 
for which may not even work, according 
to energyjustice.net are hardly green 
practices. As Energy Justices research 
suggests, IGCC is being promoted as 
clean coal, but theres nothing clean 
about coal, whether you burn it as a solid 
or if you gasify it, or liquefy it first.*
I dont need to inundate you with the 
figures you have undoubtedly heard, 
especially on this campus that is at 
least more ecologically minded than 
others. There is an urgent need for us 
to do something. If taking small steps 
in organic body lotions and leaf-shaped 
recycled gold earrings is the best we can 
do, then we must keep doing it and hope 
that it snowballs into something more 
powerful and society-changing. But 
processes that are extremely dangerous 
and damaging to the environment 
should not be able to disguise themselves 
as reformed and eco-friendly under the 
marketing trend of going green and 
respecting the environment. Reversing 
the effects of global warming is not a 
trend, and it should not be exploited as 
a consumerist marketing plot.

THE TARTAN  SEPTEMBER 17,-2007 Aii
Pointless university fees contribute to rising cost of higher education
Shaleya Solomon
With tuition reaching as high 
as $49,505 this year, sometimes 
I begin to wonder where, exactly, 
all of our money is going. Most 
of the people I talk to agree that 
there are definitely a lot of things 
that Carnegie Mellon spends too 
much money on. Unfortunately, 
most of these people could not 
tell you what they are. That being 
said, one thing that 100 percent 
of people agree on is that the cost 
of higher education is ridiculous 
now. In general, I feel like this 
university suffers from a misallocation of funds.
First off, lets talk about Orien
tation. Coming to college is a great 
experience and can be a huge 
event in many peoples lives. Ori
entation is obviously a great way 
to get new students acclimated to 
the campus, the community, and 
living away from home. So most 
schools have an orientation that 
lasts for two or three days, tops. 
Ours, of course, is a week-long
affair. Now dont get me wrong, 
I loved Orientation, and I totally 
think that a week of just firstyears on campus can help stu
dents kind of fall into college life 
more easily  by the time classes 
start, you could potentially al
ready have your friends for the 
rest of college.
Unfortunately, after experi
encing Orientation, I still cannot 
figure out just what I paid almost 
$200 for. Okay, fine, $200 is like 
nothing considering all the stuff 
you get for the whole week of 
Orientation. But looking at the 
overall picture, every single firstyear (commuter and transfer 
students included) pays $200 for 
Orientation. At 1400 or so firstyears every year, were talking 
$280,000 for Orientation. What? 
That much money for what pretty 
much amounts to nothing more 
than T-shirts, food, and a mil
lion and one ice breakers featur
ing Ritas Italian Ice? (Although I 
must admit, the T-shirts get bet
ter every year.)
In addition to Orientation, RAs 
have decent-sized budgets for so
cial events for their floors. Thats
cool and all because its kind of 
a nice emphasis on community 
and socializing. But technically 
speaking, these funds (much 
like Orientation fees) are going 
toward socializing students. We 
are more or less paying to be 
forced to interact with one an
other. Im sorry, Im not really a 
fan of having to pay to hang out 
with people. Floor events,are fun 
sometimes, but truthfully Im
usually too busy doing my home
work to even go. I can socialize 
on my own time.
In addition to outrageous 
socialization fees, why is it 
necessary to have a sleep pod for 
campus that is worth anywhere

MetroNaps installed an EnergyPod in Hunt Library in July. The 
EnergyPod was researched and 
tested at Carnegie Mellon while 
Chowdhury was an MBA student 
here. The EnergyPod provides a 
completely isolated environment 
in which the user can take a nap 
and wake up feeling refreshed. It 
boasts perfected body positioning 
for optimal comfort and relax
ation, Bose headphones, and a
full-body alarm clock. Sounds 
pretty cool. Except in all serious
ness, if youre really that tired, 
why dont you just go home and 
take a nap? About 75 percent of 
Carnegie Mellon students are liv
ing in campus housing any given 
semester, so you really could just 
go back to your own room or
your friends room, or your sig
nificant others room. And if you 
dont have enough time, suck it 
up. Find someplace else to sleep. 
Rough it like millions of college 
kids have been doing for prob
ably hundreds of years. I person
ally love the third floor of Hunt 
for taking naps. Roberts Engi
neering Hall, the UC, and the En
gineering & Science Library are 
often mentioned (in passing) on 
campus tours as good places to 
nap as well.
While the EnergyPod may be 
a good idea overall, may yield 
impressive results as far as user 
alertness after a nap, and may 
or may not have been actually 
purchased by the university, I 
hardly think it necessary to have 
one. Even if the EnergyPod was 
donated, there is still the cost of 
upkeep, maintenance, and fixing 
it if and when it breaks.
In any event, a recent flip 
through the 1988 issue of The 
Thistle as I sat in the admissions 
lobby revealed to me that people 
thought the same things about 
the cost of tuition back then as 
well. I believe the quote was
Were paying $16,000 a year for 
this? That was 19 years ago and 
the year I was born. Tuition has 
more than doubled since then. 
Going to college costs more than 
some peoples parents combined 
annual income.
My friends and I often joke that 
in about 25 or so years, when our 
children are ready to come to col
lege, campus tours will be given 
as such: Welcome to Carnegie 
Mellon, where at $100,000 an
nual tuition, we only accept 100 
students a year because theyre 
the only ones who can afford to 
come. No matter how you spin 
it, college is expensive. Tuition, 
fees, books, food: The cost of 
living for college students is un
believably high and will only 
continue to climb. Maybe just 
cutting the little things here and 
there that are somewhat unnec
essary would help alleviate the 
situation.

Carlos Mencias brand of humor perpetuates tired cultural stereotypes
version of them almost seems as 
if he had a thesaurus next to him 
and was looking up synonyms as 
he paraphrased others jokes. It 
may have worked at California 
State University, Carlos, but it 
wont work in the world of tele
vised comedy.
Lets talk about Carloss real 
name for a second. Its Ned. Un
til the age of 18, Carlos Mencia 
was Ned Holness. Now, Im not 
saying that its illegal to have 
a stage name, but if the mate
rial Mencia wrote were actually 
funny, wouldnt it still be funny 
if his name were Ned Holness? 
Mencia is actually Neds biologi
cal fathers last name, a father he 
never met.
You wont learn any of that on 
Mencias website. The sites writ
ers made a biography for Mencia 
that makes him look squeakyclean. Young Carlos was a model 
student and he stayed away from 
gangs. With a name like Ned Hol
ness, maybe the gangs stayed 
away from him.
One of the things that confuses 
me the most, though, is how 
Mencia tries to portray himself. 
Is he a good kid who loves his 
family, as his website indicates, 
or is he this tough guy who grew 
up in East Los Angeles, lived in 
poverty, and struggled to make 
it in comedy? The answer is that 
Carlos presents himself as the lat
ter to make his audience identify 
with him more, which makes him 
more money. The reality is that 
Mencia is not who he pretends 
to be, his observational humor is 
not funny, and whether or not its 
even his is up for debate.
Maybe Carlos Mencia didnt 
steal jokes from Bill Cosby, Robin 
Williams, The State, or Sam Kinison. Maybe its just a giant co
incidence. But theres one thing 
I cant accept: Carlos, if youre 
going to perpetuate negative ste
reotypes, at least do it well.
Liz Schwartz (edschwar@_) enjoys 
funny things. She wants to thank 
Lewis Black, George Carlin, and 
especially Joe Rogan for all the 
work they put into perfecting their 
craft.

Season three of Mind of Mencia 
comes out on DVD soon. How 
does Carlos Mencia still have a 
show and why do an average 
of 1.4 million people watch it?
I have yet to meet any one of 
these people, but if I ever do, rest 
assured that I will do whatever 
it takes to understand why they 
enjoy Carlos Mencias comedy.
Im not opposed to liking 
it. In truth, I wish I could, but 
every time I see him perform, I 
become physically disgusted by 
how completely unfunny I find 
him. What kind of person enjoys 
assigning negative character 
traits and flaws to their own and 
other cultures? Mencia seems to 
be saying to his audience that 
harmful cultural generalizations 
are actually positive and society 
needs them.
People who struggle with being 
negatively stereotyped shouldnt 
find Mencias comedy funny. On 
his show, Mind of Mencia, Mencia 
rips into all races and ethnici
ties and really breaks down 
each culture to find out what 
their values are and what drives 
them. HAHAHA, just kidding! 
He feeds off of the basest emo
tions of society  fear, hate, jeal
ousy  to create false characters 
and inaccurate generalizations 
about entire cultures. The peo
ple who watch .his show already 
hate people who dont look like 
them. Seeing someone famous 
like Mencia portray these ste
reotypes feeds their intolerance 
and allows them to act the way 
Carlos does on his show to actual 
people, not just actors. Mencia 
is telling the world that its com
pletely acceptable to laugh at the 
mentally and physically hand
icapped, as well as uninsured 
minorities and, as he calls them, 
fat asses.
Now, before you think Im unin
formed, biased, or unqualified to 
judge Mencias particular brand 
of comedy, I just want to say that 
Ive watched Mencias stand-up.

Ive seen his show and HBO spe
cial and I am not impressed. The 
following is a typical transcript 
of my reaction:
OH MY GOD, CARLOS, YOU 
ARE SO FUNNY. I had no idea 
that the fact that a large por
tion of the Hispanic-American 
community is religious .could 
be so funny. I bet you could do 
that with other cultures, too, 
and it would be just as funny.
Oh, I got one: Europeans talk 
funny and wear tight pants! Also, 
theyre more accepting of alter
native lifestyles. HAH A. Damn. I 
smoked their asses.
I could go on for a while like 
that. On the other hand, at least 
my observation wasnt a poor 
rehashing of a more famous 
comedians sketch, like that time 
in 2006 when Mencia did a bit 
about a father teaching his son
football that was questionably 
similar to part of Bill Cosbys rou
tine  which Cosby performed 
in 1983. Carlos Mencia has been 
accused of joke stealing by many 
other comedians. Paul Mooney, 
George Lopez, and, most vocal
ly, Joe Rogan have all accused 
Mencia of stealing jokes. It just 
begs the question: Can all these 
people be wrong?
The definitive answer, in my
mind anyway, is no. The world 
of comedy is hard to break into. 
Those who try are exposed to 
the routines of comedians 
whove made it, and some who 
havent. They study them and 
try to figure out their secrets to 
success. Its safe to assume then 
that Mencia has seen the acts 
of Bill Cosby and Sam Kinison. 
Coupled with videos of Cosbys 
ahd Kinisons routines, Mencias

Tartan womens soccer loses in overtime 2-1
WOMENS, from A14
Junior tri-captain Sarah 
DeWath believes that Carnegie 
Mellon can continue on to suc
cess by working on individual 
players and the teams weak
nesses and strengths. We are 
just getting through the young 
phases of the season. It has been 
a rough few weeks being on the 
road, but it has been a learning 
experience for a lot of the girls,
DeWath said. The focus needs 
to >e on ourselves instead of 
worrying about other teams. We 
need to eliminate our errors. It 
is not that other teams are beat
ing us. It is that we are beating 
ourselves.

remaining in the game. Their 
quarterback was a playmaker, 
seniorlinebacker Trent Sisson 
said. He was a very good athlete 
and he made a lot of throws on 
the run to pick up first downs for 
them.
Carnegie Mellon was forced to 
punt after going three and out, 
and Hobart put together a long 
scoring drive of 11 plays and 73 
yards, using up almost five min
utes to take a 27-20 lead with 
4:47 remaining.
At this point, we all knew it 
[the next drive] was going to be 
our last drive, Sivek said. I just 
said to the guys, Were tired, but 
thats not what were going to re
member later on in the season. 
We just had to give it our all. 
Thats what we did.. Everyone
executed real well. We marched 
down the field like we had to. 
Unfortunately, things didnt 
work out in the end.
Carnegie Mellon, trailing by 
seven points, moved 63 yards 
down the field on 11 plays. Sivek 
scored on a 1-yard touchdown, 
run with only 1:32 remaining to 
cut the Hobart lead to 27-26. The 
Tartans then decided to go for 
the win, lining up for a two-point 
conversion try. Junior quarter
back Doug Facemyer rolled out 
to his right and found senior run
ning back Colby Whitman in the 
front corner of the end zone, but 
Whitman was unable to hold on, 
and Hobart maintained its onepoint lead.
Hobart recovered the onside 
kick and ate up most of the re
maining time left in the game. 
The Tartans got the ball back 
with only nine seconds left, and
their Hail Mary pass was inter
cepted as time expired.
In the first half, the Tartans 
scored first on a Sivek touch
down run and again on a 1-yard 
run from Sivek to go up'13-0. 
Hobart scored the next 10 points, 
the last three coming on a field 
goal from 40 yards out as the 
first half ended.
Carnegie Mellon out-rushed 
Hobart 308-134 for the game, 
but the Statesmen held the edge 
in the passing game 247-21. 
Gimson piled up 170 yards rush
ing, and Sivek collected 105 on 
the ground to go with his three 
touchdowns. The Tartan defense 
was led by senior cornerback Jon 
Scholls career-high 20 tackles. 
Sophomore Stanley Onyimba 
also contributed nine tackles, 
two for loss, from his inside line
backer position.
We took the running game
away from them early, end then 
they went to a much more open 
offense, Sisson said. They ran a 
few tricky things, a few options, 
motioned some guys around to 
get into better position. They did 
a good job making adjustments 
to what we were doing to them, 
and it paid off for them.
There are a lot of things we 
can work on, Sivek said. As an 
offense, we need to be more con
sistent and come out and play 
like we did when we had to at the 
end of the game.
Whenever you lose a game 
thats close, you get a chance to 
see a lot of the little things that 
you need to work on, Sisson 
said. Itll be better for us in the 
long run, but it doesnt make this 
loss any lighter.

SPORTS COMMENTARY
New players emerge on the tennis scene
Matthew E. Campbell
The U.S. Open, the last slam 
of the year, finished up a few 
weeks ago. Theres still more 
tennis, though, including the 
Davis Cup and the year-ending 
championships where the top 
eight players battle it out. But 
now that the slams are done, 
we can review the season.
Roger Federer, continuously 
ranked number one since Feb. 
2, 2004 (yes  thats a record), 
reached his seventh, eighth, 
ninth, and 10th consecutive 
Grand Slam finals (yes  
thats a record), winning the 
Australian and U.S. opens and 
Wimbledon for his 10th, 11th, 
and 12th titles (Federer should 
tie Pete Samprass record of 14 
next season). Rafael Nadal con
tinued his dominance on clay, 
winning the French Open for 
the third straight time.
The Federer-Nadal rivalry 
started out interesting, but 
ultimately fizzled. It seemed 
that a new-and-improved Na
dal would be able to challenge 
Federer on surfaces besides 
clay. Nadal came extremely 
close to beating Federer in the 
Wimbledon final. As of sum
mer, there was even a chance 
that by the end of the season, 
Nadal could take the top rank
ing from Federer.
But in the summer, Nadal 
slumped as he always has. Na
dal plays a very physical style 
of tennis and runs down ev
ery ball. In the last few years, 
he has run out of energy after 
Wimbledon. After seriously 
threatening Federer at Wimble
don, Nadal trailed off, bowing 
out of the US Open in a tiredlooking fourth round defeat. I 
am waiting for Nadal to develop 
some serious injuries that will 
disrupt his career. Longevity is 
not among Nadals priorities.
The other intriguing 
development of 2007 was 
the emergence of 20-year-old
Novak Djokovic. At the hard 
court tournament in Montreal, 
Djokovic beat third-ranked 
Andy Roddick in the quarters, 
second-ranked Nadal in the 
semis, and number-one Federer 
in the final. Although Djok
ovic lost the US Open final to 
Federer, he is the real deal and 
will challenge Federer and Na
dal next season.
Federer (7605), Nadal 
(5385), and Djokovic (4295) 
have set themselves far apart 
from the rest of the field in the 
rankings. Davydenko at num
ber four is about 1000 points 
(a Grand Slam titles worth of 
points) below Djokovic and 
Roddick is a further 700 points 
below Davydenko.
The question for 2008 is 
whether anyone can challenge 
the top three. Roddick is a 
combined 3-16 against those 
players. Davydenko is 0-12 
against Federer and Nadal. 
James Blake usually loses early 
in the slams, so hes not even a 
factor.
All of the players in the top 
20 have been around for a 
while; theyve all been losing 
to Federer and Nadal for the 
last three years. Young Andy 
Murray was turning into a 
dangerous player until he got 
injured, so it will be interesting 
to have him back.
For prospects, we must in
clude American John Isner, 
who just finished up his NCAA 
career but has made a splash on 
the professional circuit already 
with his fearlessness backed up 
by a serve  its a testament to 
his youth and lack of experience 
that Isner can hit second-serve 
aces routinely.
The womens season was 
interesting as well. Justine 
Henin won the French and US 
opens. Serena Williams came 
back from a long injury layoff 
and won the Australian Open 
(her eighth slam), defeating 
several top players. Serena can 
beat anyone, anytime. Venus
Williams won Wimbledon for 
the fourth time, her sixth slam 
overall.
The most exciting storyline, 
however, was the rivalry be
tween the Williams sisters and 
top-ranked Justine Henin. Be
fore this season, Henin had a 
lousy record against Venus and 
had only beaten Serena on clay. 
However, Henin took out Ser
ena at the French Open (where 
she won her third straight), 
Wimbledon, and the US Open. 
Henins US Open title run (her 
seventh slam overall) was spec
tacular  she took out both 
Williams sisters in straight sets 
on the way.
Two players emerged. Jelena Jankovic rose to the third 
spot in the rankings. Jankovic 
is a quick player with some 
weapons. However, she doesnt 
have enough firepower and 
will not win a Grand Slam. Ana 
Ivanovic, whos the age of most 
college sophomores, got to the 
French Open final. Ivanovic 
has lots of weapons, but is a bit 
slow-moving.
So, who will be the Grand 
Slam contenders in 2008? 
Henin and the Williams sis
ters are the top players in the 
world right now. They all have 
great games. Each player has 
huge weapons. These three 
can defend against Ivanovic 
and match her weaponry. 
Sharapova is a big question 
mark after several ugly and 
perplexing losses in the 2007 
slams. Amelie Mauresmo, who 
won two slams in 2006, all but 
disappeared in 2007.
The 2008 season promises to 
be interesting. Well see if Djok
ovic or anyone else can loosen 
Federer and Nadals grip on the 
sport. We will see what hap
pens between Henin and the 
Williams sisters, whether Ma
ria Sharapova can bounce back, 
and whether any of the young 
guns  Jankovic, Ivanovic, 
Chakvetadze  can challenge 
them.

Club sports roundup: baseball, rowing
by Erin Gagnon
Sports Editor
Baseball
The baseball team opened its 
fall season Saturday with a 3-2 
win over the University of Pitts
burgh. The Tartans faltered in 
the second game of the doubleheader against Pitt, losing 12-1.
In the first game, Pitt took an 
early lead, scoring two in the first 
inning, but the Panthers would 
remain scoreless for the rest of 
the game. Junior starting pitcher 
Jon Coens threw a complete 
game, allowing only two earned 
runs and striking out eight.
Carnegie Mellon got on the 
scoreboard in the fourth inning
when junior third baseman Ryan 
Bottini scored on a double hit to 
center field by senior outfielder 
Jim Stedman.
The Tartans tied the game at 
2-2 in the sixth inning when a 
single by senior first baseman 
Ryan Comes brought junior 
catcher Brian Tabata home from 
third base. In the seventh, Bottinis hit to center field brought 
first-year outfielder Joe Seymour 
home to win the game.
Carnegie Mellons offense 
cooled in the second game, as ju
nior shortstop Mike Niedzwiecki 
scored the Tartans only run in 
the loss. As starting pitcher, Bot
tini pitched four innings, allow
ing five earned runs on seven 
hits and striking out three.
The baseball team will return
to the diamond on Saturday to 
play a double-header against 
Franciscan University.
Rowing
Last Saturday the rowing club 
opened its season and traveled 
to Cleveland, Ohio to compete at 
the Head of the Cuyahoga race.
Highlights from the race in
cluded a first-place finish by the 
womens varsity lightweight four 
boat, and strong races from the 
mens eight and four boats and 
the womens doubles, eight and 
four boats.
The rowing club will be back 
in action Saturday, Oct. 6, at the 
Head of the Ohio race, which 
will be held in Pittsburgh on the

Mens tennis destroys Robert Morris
by Matthew E. Campbell
Copy Manager
The Carnegie Mellon mens 
tennis team had a busy week
end playing matches against 
Robert Morris and Duquesne 
universities Friday at home be
fore competing in the Allegheny 
Invitational Saturday in Meadville, Pa. The Tartans demolished 
Robert Morris before falling to 
Duquesne. The team bounced 
back though, winning the Al
legheny Invitational.
Head coach Andy Girard said 
hes excited about the season 
ahead. The team should be very 
strong this year, he said. Were 
young, but if they play as well as 
they can, they should be top 10 in 
the nation.
Friday morning, the Tartans 
started off strong, crushing Di
vision I opponent Robert Morris 
by an overall score of 8-1. Firstyears Bobby MacTaggart and 
Matt Belenky both hit the ground 
running as they began their col
lege careers. They defeated 
senior opponents by scores of
6-3, 6-0 and 6-1, 6-1, respec
tively. Another first-year, Alex 
Nemerov, lost an epic match 6-7 
(0), 6-4,0-1 (10).
There are a couple new 
freshmen who should make an 
immediate impact, Girard said.
Team veterans, including 
sophomores Ravi Raghavan,
Do you know what to do if there's a chemical or biological attack in your 
community? How about a radiological explosion? In an emergency 
like that, knowledge and common sense will help you stay calm and safe.

Payom Dousti, James Muliawan, 
and Nikola Ljuboja and juniors 
Spencer Svetcov and Yiran Liu 
played well, going undefeated in 
singles and doubles against Rob
ert Morris.
Later in the day, Carnegie 
Mellon lost 2-7 to Division I 
Duquesne University. Despite 
the score line, there were several 
close matches. Liu lost a hardfought match that was ultimately 
decided by a few points, 6-4, 
4-6, 0-1 (7). Junior Jon Spero 
(6-3, 6-2) and MacTaggart won, 
though MacTaggart came back 
from the brink of defeat in a 5-7,
7-6 (10), 1-0 (8) victory.
We knew coming in that 
Robert Morris would be a good 
tune-up for Duquesne. We played 
well against Robert Morris and
really took care of business. 
Duquesne is one of the best 
teams we will play all season and 
we had extra motivation because 
we really lost a heartbreaker to 
them last year. We played well, 
especially in singles, but unfortu
nately we came up short against 
a very strong team, Spero said.
Facing college players was 
similar to facing some play
ers Ive played in USTA (United 
States Tennis Association) tour
naments, but some of the guys 
play at a higher level from what 
Im used to. I hope to make some 
adjustments and show them up 
next time, Belenky said.
On Saturday, the Tartans 
traveled to Meadville, Pa. for a 
rain-plagued team tournament 
in which they played Case West
ern Reserve University and host 
Allegheny College.
The Tartans took Case to task. 
In singles, Nemerov, Spero, 
and Svetcov lost a total of three 
games; Nemerov embarrassed 
his opponent 6-0, 6-0, Spero 
trounced his 6-1, 6-0, and 
Svetcov won 6-1, 6-1. The Tar
tans were equally dominant in 
doubles.
The championship match 
between Carnegie Mellon and 
Allegheny was shortened due to 
rain; only seven matches were 
played. That just meant the 
Tartans could get the job done 
quicker, prevailing 5-1. Carn
egie Mellon swept the doubles 
with Ljuboja and Muliawan 
(8-6), MacTaggart and Ragha
van (8-2), and Nemerov and 
Spero (8-1) winning. Spero and 
Nemerov both won in singles.

The Carnegie Mellon foot
ball teams hopes of another 
perfect season ended Saturday 
when they lost 27-26 to the 
Hobart College Statesmen at 
Boswell Field in Geneva, N.Y. 
The Tartans (2-1) trailed by a 
touchdown late in the fourth 
quarter and mounted a late 
scoring drive, but it proved to 
not be enough in the end.
It was a good effort by ev
eryone, senior fullback Travis 
Sivek said. I felt that we had a 
really good chance to win the 
game, we executed well, and we 
scored when we needed towe 
just came up a little bit short.
Hobart (1-1), a perennial 
NCAA Division III playoff team, 
used the passing game to put 
points up against the Tartans 
and come away with the vic
tory. In this first-ever meeting 
between the two teams, Carn
egie Mellon took a 13-10 lead 
into halftime; however, Hobart 
tied the game late in the third 
quarter on a 29-yard field goal. 
Carnegie Mellon responded 
with a touchdown drive capped 
off by a 14-yard run from senior 
running back Robert Gimson 
with 14:27 remaining to regain 
the lead at 20-13.

The womens volleyball team 
extended its winning streak to 
three games last Wednesday 
with an impressive 3-0 victory 
against cross-city rivals Point 
Park University. The win raised 
the Tartans season record to 
4-6.
The Tartans swept the Pio
neers in three straight matches 
with scores of 30-26,30-22, and 
30-24. First-year outside hitter
Caroline Size led the offensive 
charge with 18 kills. Also scoring 
in double digit kills was junior 
middle hitter Chisom Amaechi 
who had 10 in the match.
The first game would prove to 
be the most difficult as neither 
team would give ground. After 
giving up three quick points, 
the Tartans were able to settle 
down and bring the match to a 
dead heat. The score would vol
ley back-and-forth for most of 
the match until the Tartans were 
finally able to close out the com
petition with a 30-26 victory.
We had a lot of energy and 
we were really motivated by this 
game, Amaechi said. We really 
wanted to win. I think our en
ergy helped us to win.
The Tartans would carry that 
energy into the next game as 
they would jump out to an early 
9-0 lead. Defensive specialist 
Cameron Griffin picked up five 
ces in the match to jumpstart 
the Tartans. The Pioneers would 
close the gap to within four points 
but the early offensive explosion 
by the Tartans proved to be too 
great an obstacle to overcome.
The Tartans went on to win the 
match by a final score of 30-22.
After the first game we kind 
of knew what they had and we 
adjusted to that, Amaechi said. 
After seeing what happened the 
first game we knew what we had 
to fix and we did that.
The Tartans would not slow 
down in the third match as they 
would complete the sweep with a 
30-24 victory.

wins 3-2
by Doug Fricker
Senior Sports Staff
The Carnegie Mellon mens 
soccer team showed some 
character and composure in its 
come-from-behind 3-2 victory 
over the Juniata Eagles on the 
road Saturday
Sophomore midfielder Ryan 
Browne scored the game-tying 
goal in the 64th minute, and 
then sophomore forward Pat
rick Lutz put the Tartans ahead 
for good with under 10 minutes 
to go. The Tartans improve to 
3-0 on the season while Juniata 
drops to 1-5.
It was a pretty exciting 
game, sophomore forward 
Ricky Griffin said. We had a 
disappointing first half and we 
were upset to be tied at 1-1. 
We were upset with a penalty 
call that they got. We stepped 
it up in the second half, came 
out hard. Even though we went 
down 2-1, we really stepped it 
up and showed some character 
to win the game. Were happy 
with our effort.
Griffin started the scoring 
for Carnegie Mellon in the fifth 
minute of the game, when he 
scored his team-leading third 
goal of the season. Their right 
back passed it back to the center 
back and I read that so I inter
cepted it, Griffin said. I was 
on a breakaway and their goalie 
made the first save but I was

Womens soccer falls short at home
by Elizabeth Haldane
Staffwriter
The Carnegie Mellon womens 
soccer team hosted the College 
of Wooster Fighting Scots at 
Gesling Stadium last Friday. The 
match resulted in a 2-1 defeat 
in overtime giving the Tartans a 
2-3 record overall.
Carnegie Mellon came into 
the match confident. However, 
Wooster put the Tartans under 
heavy offensive pressure from 
the beginning. Wooster defender 
Angela Evans set up a free kick 
and rifled a shot past Carnegie 
Mellon junior goalkeeper Chris
tie Adams. This early goal put 
Wooster up in the fourth minute 
of play.
The Tartans struggled to stay 
in the game mentally, and were 
unable to gain composure in 
their attacking third. The team
had several scoring opportuni
ties, but did not monopolize on 
its chances to get past Wooster 
goalkeeper Abby Brown.
With Carnegie Mellons dif
ficulty regrouping from the 
anticipation of a win and be
ing down by one goal, the team 
struggled to stay in the game 
mentally. It was not until the 
79th minute that the Tartans 
scored the equalizer.
Carnegie Mellon first-year 
midfielder Kate Smith fought for 
a ball in front of the net and was 
tackled in the penalty box just 
before cranking a shot off.
The referee gave the Tartans 
a free kick from just outside the 
18-yard box, which gave junior 
forward Abby Coffin an oppor
tunity to score her third goal of 
the season. Coffin slammed the 
ball through Woosters wall, and 
the ball skidded into the lower 
far corner of the net at the 78:32
mark.
The score remained 1-1 un
til the clock ran out and both 
teams had to continue into sudden-death overtime play. With 
increased pressure, both teams 
attempted to stabilize their de
fenses and enhance their attacks. 
Carnegie Mellons defensive line 
was caught offguard 30 yards out 
from the goal and after several 
missed kicks, Tartan first-year 
goalkeeper Anya Rosen, who was 
subbed in at the 29th minute for 
Adams, was left out of position.
Wooster Kate Kiley chipped the 
ball over Rosens head to score 
the golden goal in the 94th min
ute. The match resulted in a 2-1 
defeat for the Tartans.
Wooster and Carnegie Mellon 
both took eight shots. Adams had 
one save and Rosen stopped two 
shots for the Tartans.

The mens soccer team is 3-0 
after winning its home opener 
last week against Westminster 
College. Leading that game 
in scoring with two goals was 
sophomore midfielder Jonathan 
Hall. The Tartan caught up with 
Hall after the teams victory
this weekend against Juniata 
College to talk about his contri
butions to the team.
Tartan: When did you start 
playing soccer and how did you 
get into the sport?
Hall: I started playing soccer 
when I was probably four or five 
in the youth YMCA league. The 
sport came natural to me, so 
thats probably why I stuck with 
it. Also, my dad coached all of 
my teams until I was eleven. 
Having him involved made it all 
the more enjoyable when I was 
young.
T: What made you decide to 
play soccer in college?
H: I always knew I wanted to 
play college soccer. I was looking 
to play at every school I applied 
to. Playing and having success 
at the collegiate level was al
ways my final goal when it came 
to soccer. Im so thankful for the 
opportunity play competitively 
for a few more years.
T: Was soccer or the team it
self any part of your decision to 
come to Carnegie Mellon?
H: My decision to come to 
Carnegie Mellon was both for
academic and athletic reasons. I 
was completely sold on the high 
academic reputation of Carnegie 
Mellon and the business school, 
but I also felt like this was one 
of the best places in the country 
to play soccer. I saw that the 
soccer team was made up of a 
great group of guys, and we are 
fortunate enough to be a part of 
one of the most, if not the most, 
competitive Division III soccer 
conferences. Academically and 
athletically, Carnegie Mellon is 
a hard school to beat.
T: How are you handling the 
strenuous academic load on top 
of athletics?
H: So far, so good. I find that 
I have always been more orga
nized and done better in the 
classroom during soccer season. 
I am forced to be a better time 
manager when so much of my 
schedule is taken up by prac
tices and games.
T: Any rituals or pre-game 
superstitions?
H: I always listen to Heart 
of A Champion by Nelly before 
games. It gets me focused.
T: Is there anything in par
ticular that you attribute your 
success to?
H: Definitely attribute any 
success I have to my parents. 
Soccer is an expensive and timeconsuming sport to pursue. 
Growing up, they spent count
less weekends traveling around 
the country so that I could play 
club soccer. I am so appreciative 
of all of the sacrifices they made 
for me. Theyre model parents 
in my book.
T: Do you have a favorite 
place to play?
H: I love playing at home, first 
and foremost. My grandparents 
and some of my extended family 
make it to almost every game. 
However, my moms family is 
from St. Louis, and although I 
havent gotten to play there yet, 
I am looking forward to play
ing Wash. U. I think I might get 
some extra fan support.
T: Favorite thing to do during 
the off-season?
H: My friends and I like to 
get involved with IM sports dur
ing the off-season. Our team 
gets together to hang out a lot, 
as well. Im a huge Pittsburgh 
sports fan, too.
Tartan cross country 
takes second and fifth
by Sam Kim
Staffwriter
Last Saturday, the Carnegie 
Mellon mens and womens cross 
country teams competed in the 
Indiana University of Pennsyl
vania (IUP) Invitational. The 
entire mens team m^de its de
but and had a strong showing, 
finishing second with 44 points 
behind Slippery Rock Univer
sitys 15 points. The womens 
team also had a solid finish with 
119 points, placing fifth among 
seven teams. IUP won the invita
tional with 28 points.
Despite windy weather and 
a hilly course, the mens team 
saw four runners in the top 10. 
Junior Breck Fresen led the team 
and finished sixth overall with 
a time of 27:29. First-year J.P. 
Allen and senior Mark Tressler 
finished seventh and ninth 
overall with times of 27:30 and 
27:53, respectively. Fifth-year 
Geoff Misek took 10th with a 
time of 27:43.
Today was the first race for 
a few of the freshmen. J.P. ran 
well, especially for this being 
his first ever five-mile race. Mark
Tressler also ran well. We knew 
he was in good shape, but it was 
good to see him put it together, 
Fresen said. In general it was 
nice to see a really tight pack. 
I think our spread was only 18 
seconds, which is really promis
ing.
Behind Misek, junior Ryan 
Anderson had an impressive day 
placing 12th with a time of 27:47. 
Sophomore Dario Donatelli and 
junior Mike Condon took 15th 
and 16th with times of 28:01 and 
28:02, respectively.
Being my first year on the 
team, today was the only oppor
tunity Ive had to race with the 
varsity guys so I was excited to 
see where I fell in with the pack, 
Condon said.
Sophomore Chris Rizzo 
(28:11) and senior Dan Carmody 
(28:17) finished 18th and 20th 
overall, respectively. A pair of 
first-years, Justin Kurp (28:19) 
and Dan Addis (28:40), also fin

THE TARTAN  SEPTEMBER 17, 2007B3
Making the most of the TOC and BOC
From preparing your resume to getting an interview
Getting ready
1. Research 
The industry
Investigate industry trends and general facts about the environment 
in which youre interested in working. Know the big names and 
companies within the industry, and be able to identify recent events 
and breakthroughs. For example, if the industry in which youre 
planning on working is urban redevelopment, be able to discuss such 
trends as brownfield revitalization and sustainable design, and know 
about projects that have been getting press nationwide.
Read up on the industry online, in magazines, and in newspapers 
before heading to the Business Opportunities Conference and 
Technical Opportunities Conference. Make sure you can answer the 
following questions: When did significant shifts in materials, ideas, 
and people take place? Where does most industry work take place? 
What new ideas and technologies might the industrys future hold?
The company
Demonstrating that you have researched a company before showing 
up at its booth at the BOC or TOC shows that you not only are 
interested in the company itself, but also that you are responsible 
and came thoroughly prepared for the fair. Search the companys 
website to understand its basic organization, its research or projects, 
and its overall goals and beliefs. Understanding these concepts will 
help you to see how your own work and goals compare with those of 
the company. Also, being able to discuss specifics of the company 
will demonstrate that you are more invested than someone simply 
browsing past the booth.
Check out www.hoovers.com, which is free on campus, for more 
research on companies, and www.guidestar.org, for more research on 
nonprofits.
The position
Do as much research as you can on the job you will potentially be 
applying for before you get to the companys booth. If information 
about the specific job is not available on the website or elsewhere, 
try to at least get a grasp of what the general jobs or work are at the 
company. If you know this information beforehand, you will not only 
impress your potential employer but also be able to gain meaningful 
information about the position.
2. Compose your resume 
The 20-second read
Employers are likely reading your resume as one of many, so make 
sure it stands out visually and is cohesive in both design and 
content. Read on for tips on how to make sure your resume ends up 
on the yes pile instead of in the trash.
Quick-scan format
Break up the information on the page into easy-to-read chunks, and 
organize them in a logical order: education, experience, activities, 
skills, and relevant coursework if applicable. Using small, round 
bullet points, include two to three lines of relevant information 
underneath each aspect of these sections. Be sure to use active 
words to describe your experiences and activities. If you did robotics 
research, write: researched robotic sensor masts rather than just 
robotics research.
While your name and contact information should be in a larger, 
more outstanding typeface at the top of your resume, the rest of the 
text should be 11- or 12-point font. Use bolding or italicization to 
emphasize headings or subheadings, but be careful not to overuse 
such features  you dont want to create an overwhelming and 
cluttered page.
Edit and specialize
Proofread your resume.-Then have a friend proofread your resume. 
Then, another friend, or professor, or career counselor. Grammatical 
and spelling errors in your resume signal a lack of attention to detail 
and a lack of enthusiasm and respect for your potential employer.
Also, create several different versions of your resume if youre 
interested in different fields of work. For example, if youre interested 
in journalism and costume design, tailor your resume so that the 
experiences, activities, and skills listed highlight either of those 
respective disciplines.
3. Compose yourself
As the old adage goes, dress for the job you want, not the job you 
have. If your current job is being a full-time student with a double 
major in physics and not sleeping, ditch your sweatpants for some 
more professional attire. At the BOC and TOC, employers will be 
expecting you to look your best.
Women: Aim for solid colors and conservative suit and shirt-skirt 
styles. Wear closed-toe shoes, limited jewelry, and conservative 
make-up and perfume, and make sure your nails are manicured.
Men: Wear solid colors and a conservative suit jacket with matching 
slacks, a coordinated long-sleeved button-down shirt, a conservative 
tie, dark socks, and professional shoes. Make sure your nails are 
manicured and be sure to go light on cologne.
Also, both men and women should carry a clean and organized 
portfolio in which to keep resumes and hold company business cards 
and information handouts.
Inside the BOC and TOC
1. Act professionally 
Introduce yourself
Prepare a small blurb to say once you introduce yourself to your 
potential employer. Explain who you are and why you are talking to 
the recruiter in one concise sentence. Practice beforehand to speak 
fluidly and confidently, as employers will likely form their impressions 
of you in these first few moments.
Make contact
Stand tall, avoid shifting your weight around, and speak calmly. 
Shake hands firmly and confidently. Be sure not to criticize your 
own accomplishments or other related companies so that recruiters 
remember you as a positive person.
2. Ask questions
Use the research you did to your advantage. Ask specific questions: 
What is it actually like to work for the company? What is an average 
work week like? What is the overall company atmosphere? How will 
your studies be best applied at the company?
Following up
Send a letter
A few days after the BOC and TOC, send the company a letter 
reminding them who you are and where you met. Thank them for the 
meeting, and say you will follow up with a phone call in a few days to 
set up a second meeting.

Eugene Gloria begins Adamson writers series
Poet tells jokes and captures the young life
The creative writing program offered its first 
speaker of the year in the Adamson Visiting 
Writers Series last Thursday night, welcoming 
accomplished poet Eugene Gloria. Introducing 
Gloria, faculty member Yona Harvey said, His 
poems combine history, heritage, vulnerability, 
and art alongside myth." Harvey also mentioned 
the glowing review of Glorias second collection, 
Hoodlum Birds, by United States Poet Laureate 
Robert Pinsky.
Terrance Hayes, a creative writing professor, 
explained how Carnegie Mellon pursued Gloria. 
The department tends to look for "interesting 
work across the country, often drawing from work 
professors use in their classes.
Hayes admitted being apprehensive because no 
one on the faculty had seen Gloria read. It was a 
gamble just based on his work, but it was a risk 
rewarded, he said. Hayes had read Glorias books, 
but was unsure of if the speaker would hold the 
audiences attention with his performance. Hayes 
was pleased with the result: "He told jokes; people 
laughed.
Gloria is a professor at DePauw University and a 
teacher of both English and creative writing. After 
receiving his bachelors degree from San Francisco 
State University and his M.A. from The Ohio State 
University, he became a graduate student at the 
University of Oregon working toward his MFA.
Gloria, a Pushcart Prize and American Society of 
Poetry award recipient, recommended graduate 
school to his audience, remembering how positive 
it felt to be treated as a writer before actually 
becoming one. His days, he recalled, were full 
of sunshine, but after recounting a story about a 
crappy car he owned at that time, he admitted,
"Maybe they werent happy times. I was just 
stupid."
During his reading, Gloria read from both Hoodlum 
Birds (2006) and its predecessor, Drivers at the 
Short-Time Motel (2000), both published by 
Penguin. Drivers at the Short-Time Motel was 
short-listed for both the 1999 National Poetry Series 
and the 2001 Asian American Literary Award.
Gloria opened with a work-in-progress titled 
"Apple, explaining that it was merely a test 
and not a finished product, before continuing 
with works from his two books. Glorias poems 
discussed his childhood as a Filipino in the San 
Francisco Bay area and the imagined troubles of 
his brother, a veteran, during the Vietnam War. 
(Gloria grinned later, saying, "The poem makes it 
seem like he died, but he didnt. Hes alive. Dont 
worry.) He read several poems about visiting and 
exploring Spain before retreating to the reception 
in the Gladys Schmidt Creative Writing Center, 
where audience members enjoyed pizza and 
mingled. Gloria sold both of his books and was 
available to sign copies.
I was excited for what [his reading] meant for 
the students, Hayes said. Hes Asian-American, 
and hes younger. He writes about saints, sex, and 
being young. I was happy for our audience."
The Adamson Visiting Writers Series continues 
Jan. 28, 2008 with Dave Eggers, recently named 
recipient of one of six Heinz Awards.

Secondhand, first class
Vintage and thrift stores worth
It seems that clothes, like wine and George Clooney, only 
grow better with age. It should come as no surprise, then, that 
thrift and vintage stores have become increasingly popular 
among the hip and stylish. San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury 
district and Philadelphias South Street are popular for 
their quality secondhand stores. Never fear, fashion lovers: 
Pittsburgh has plenty of vintage clothing to offer. Our guide 
can point you to some of the best places in the city to snag 
chic secondhand finds.
Eons Fashion Antique 5850 Ellsworth Ave, Shadyside. 
412.361.3368.
The sheer volume of merchandise packed into Eons Fashion 
Antique is impressive. Although the cramped quarters and 
winding aisles make it a bit difficult to shop, clothing is 
organized by size and type of garment to simplify the process. 
Most of the stores clothes are from the 1960s and '70s.
The quality of the clothing at Eons is consistently high: The 
pieces are glamorous and well made. Unfortunately, the cost 
of the clothing is a bit steep.
Women's dresses range from $20 to $95 in price and include 
frocks in fabrics from olive chiffon to white brocade. There are 
bunches of women's '20s-style cloche hats (think flappers) in 
bright colors. Necklaces average a $15 price tag, and are well 
worth the money. Other adorable accessories include vintage 
brooches, rings, sunglasses, and tiaras.
The vintage-interested man can find tuxedo shirts in every 
pastel color under the sun for just $20. Eons also sells a ton of 
mens leather jackets, button-down shirts, jeans, and pants. 
Check out the printed neckties, too.
Highlight: Remarkable array of womens sequined tops ($12 
to $50). Average price of a mink stole: $60. Average price of a 
bow tie: $10.
Hey Betty! 5892 Ellsworth Ave., Shadyside. 412.363.0999. -
Hey Betty! sells vintage clothing, furniture, and housewares. 
The boutique has three roomy stories that are chock-full of 
mostly 1950sand 60s-era clothing.
The prices are less intimidating than those at Eons. A 1960s 
linen lime green and white belted dress, for example, will 
only'run you $30  and you can find several unique dresses 
for $20. Also notable in women's wear is the large selection 
of belts, the beautiful cardigans, and cheap shoes (most are 
$20). If youre searching for the 1940s schoolmarm ankle boots 
that are in vogue this season, Hey Betty! has a few pairs for 
around $30.
Menswear is also relatively cheap: Denim and printed pants 
are generally $20 to $25, but several pairs are even cheaper. 
The array of button-down shirts and bowling shirts (about $30 
on average) includes several charming prints, the highlight 
of which is a long-sleeved button-down printed with an Old 
West-themed scene. Men's vests and sweaters are a steal.
Hey Betty! 's merchandise includes a few vintage chairs and 
one table-and-chair set that looks straight out of a 1950s diner
your last $7
($250). Housewares include plates and several sets of glasses 
and shot glasses. You can even buy vintage books at Hey 
Betty!, such as The Complete Guide to Disco Dancing (1978) 
by Karen Lustgarten for $8.
Highlight: Fist-sized owl charm necklace. Average price of 
a vintage saucer: $3. Average price of a vintage women's 
bathing suit: $23.
Avalon Exchange 5858 Forbes Ave., Squirrel Hill. 
412.421.2911.
Avalon Exchange is a popular destination for selling and 
exchanging clothes as well as purchasing secondhand 
merchandise. The store will buy clothing for 30 percent of 
its retail value (paid in cash) and exchange clothing for 45 
percent of its value (paid in store credit).
In Avalon's new Squirrel Hill storefront, clothing hangs 
from double-decker garment racks packed closely together, 
which makes searching for finds somewhat onerous. Unlike 
Eons and Hey Betty!, which specialize in vintage clothing, 
Avalon sells clothes you could easily purchase firsthand 
at retail locations. That is to say, the great majority of the 
clothing is contemporary rather than vintage. Prices, then, are 
appropriately lower than those at vintage boutiques.
Avalon has quite a lot of clothing and accessories to choose 
from, but selections can be hit-or-miss. If youre looking for 
band shirts or ironic T-shirts and want to wade through less 
riffraff than youd find at donation-based thrift stores, Avalon 
is a good choice. T-shirts average about $7 to $9. If you want a 
Van Halen OU812 shirt, however, you'll be a cool $15 poorer.
Halloween costumes, interesting belts, and winter coats 
are among the choice finds at Avalon  and are reasonably 
priced. (Coats are all miraculously under $20.) Womens 
dresses are as cheap as $9.50, and a cute tweed blazer is only 
$8. The selection of men's button-downs, T-shirts, and polos is 
easily the cheapest and most varied in the city.
Highlight: Sale rack (50 percent off merchandise)! Average 
cost of men's leather ankle boots: $15.
Goodwill 2600 E. Carson St., South Side. 412.481.9005.
Goodwill is a good old-fashioned thrift store. Items are 
insanely cheap, and the pieces range from vintage to 
c6ntemporary. Like Hey Betty!, Goodwill deals in much more 
than just clothing. You can find everything from secondhand 
books to dining sets to couches at Goodwill's South Side 
location.
If youre willing to put in a couple hours' worth of searching, 
you can find plenty of fashionable merchandise. Funny 
T-shirts cost $1 to $3 oh average. Among all the Dragon Ball 
Z and Pitt shirts, you can find gems like rare band T-shirts for 
dirt cheap. A dining set complete with plates, saucers, and 
cups costs about $10 to $15, and there are plenty of vintage 
1970s options to choose from.
improve communities. Spend some time searching, and youll 
score sweet items for anywhere from a third to a tenth of the 
price you'll pay at the high-end vintage boutiques.
Highlight: Neutral Milk Hotel T-shirt for $4. Average cost of a 
complete outfit: $10 to $15.

Rilo Kiley sells outM.I.A. induces seizures, and
Rilo Kiley, Under the Blacklight
I thought Jenny Lewis was supposed to be cool. On Rilo 
Kileys latest record, Under the Blacklight, lead singer 
and frontwoman of the late Lewis seems more like a 
wannabe sexy, edgy, talented indie pop star than the 
real thing. In the majority of the albums 11 tracks, Lewis 
unknowingly and embarrassingly makes it very clear 
that she wants to sound like someone who knows the 
ins and outs of sleazy nights in Los Angeles. The lady 
doth protest too much, methinks. Cool rock n roll stars 
dont need to emphasize their coveted debauchery; it's 
apparent. Not only that, but when Lewis talks about 
sex  which she does quite frequently  she sounds 
removed, as if trying desperately hard to remember what 
an empty one-night stand or wild threesome feels like.
Lewis also likes to write songs about what I call "trendy" 
subjects. Here, one wonders if shes writing about these 
issues because she really cares deeply about them, or 
because she knows that a very large group of people will 
understand them in some vague way. The song 15, for 
example, is about a guy who has sex with a rebellious 
15-year-old girl, not knowing her true age. Breakin Up 
is a sort of Girl Power" anthem, celebrating the idea 
that, for a woman, a breakup can be a liberating rather 
than a devastating experience. Lastly, "Dreamworld" 
talks about an innocent kid who loses his legs after his 
father makes him fight in a war overseas. Lewis also 
seems to have a knack for using fruit-inspired similes, 
throwing in lines like ripe as a peach and "bruised like 
a cherry.
The music itself also belies Lewiss efforts to sound like 
someone whos been there. As per usual with Rilo 
Kiley, Under the Blacklight has a country twang, which 
already makes it more susceptible to entering the realm
of cheesiness. But thats
Courtesy of miauk.com
almost like an electric keyboard on the rock guitar 
setting. And when not stealing guitar lines from George 
Harrisons My Sweet Lord, Rilo Kiley likes to compose 
guitar and keyboard riffs that simply repeat the vocal 
melody. Oh, and it's overproduced.
Under the Blacklight has its strengths, to be sure.
Lewiss voice has never sounded better. It soars and 
quavers over the cookie-cutter music beneath it, like 
an all-star quarterback on a mediocre football team.
And while the songs are predictable, overwrought, and 
uninspired, theyre all for the most part agreeable to 
listen to; some of them even sound pretty good. After 
switching from an indie record label to a major one, 
putting out the solo album Rabbit Fur Coat last year, and 
taking over the once democratic Rilo Kiley, Lewis clearly 
has her eye on the stadiums, perfect venues for playing 
this type of music.

Kala
Who is M.I.A.? If you, like so many others, are 
unfamiliar with the Sri Lankan electronic rapping, social 
commenting, Perez Hilton favorite, this is a briefing: 
There is yet another music phenomenon, straight from 
the U.K.
M.I.A.'s second studio album, Kala, is even more intense 
and electronic than her first venture, Arular. Still, Kala 
lacks the playfulness offered throughout the entirety of 
M.I.A.s debut, featuring instead some serious hiphop/electronic/dance beats. Take, for example, the 
closing track, "Come Around," which features producer 
Timbaland's Midas touch. This track, among others, 
brings out the hip-hop in M.I.A. without abandoning 
her electronic/dance roots, creating the types of songs 
that you cant get out of your head, from her first single 
Boyz to the sequel "$20 (a rant on inflation  compare 
to the track from Arular titled "10 Dollar"). Fortunately, 
her social awareness hasnt quit since her debut.
Its true: M.I.A. is still representing those fervent views 
on guns, bombs, and war, and shes still in your face.
This album doesnt talk any smack about President 
Bush, unfortunately, but M.I.A. touches on the warwasted, malnourished countries in Africa and black 
market trades in India, and she's still as blunt as ever.
Kala, although much awaited by her fans, is a complete 
turn from Arular. It isnt as captivating, nor perfectly 
indifferent to societys view on her opinions. This time 
around, M.I.A. seems to be a bit more conscious of what 
her words mean to people, though she is still determined 
to get all of her words out, one way or another. But. 
with M.I.A. sporting a stronger image than ever before
 bright-patterned, seizure-inducing outfits and a 
blonde-tipped bob  you wont be able to say youve 
never heard of her by the end of 2007.

In 1996 DJ Shadow released his debut album Endtroducing......I dont
know much about its impact on the music world at that time, but Ill 
share my personal experiences with it.
Once I started listening to the album, it took me three years or so to 
,slowly get obsessed with it. I liked it at first, and thought it was great, 
but put it away as I got distracted with other new music. Every once 
in a while someone would mention it and Id dig it out and listen again 
and like it a little more. The same thing happened with my friends. They 
enjoyed it at first, put it away, and wound up completely taken over by 
its subtle greatness a few years later.
The experience comes in two parts; the first revelation that the album 
provides the listener is a complete trust in sampling as a musical
instrument and an art form. For those unaware, Endtroducing....is
an album composed entirely of samples from other sources  among 
the first of its kind. Shadow expertly weaves drum loops, bass lines, 
strings, and all sorts of beautiful melodies into completely new songs. 
The effect can be mesmerizing; at times it seems that Shadow had all 
the melodies in his head already and only had to sift through hundreds 
of records to find the ones that matched what he already knew. In 
reality, the process was likely similar, though Shadow was probably 
influenced by the types of samples he heard as well.
Once you hear Endtroducing.... its almost laughable to see how
excited people get about Madonna sampling ABBA and Crazy In 
Loves sample of the Chi-Lites. The diffrence? Shadow doesnt owe 
the greatness of his songs to the greatness of his samples.
The albums second revelation comes the next time you hear one of 
the sampled songs in full. Shadows samples usually sound nothing
like what the end result is on Endtroducing.....For example, Shadows
Stem/Long Stem samples the beginning of Love Suite by Nirvana 
(60s psychedelic band, not Cobains). On Shadows track, the strings 
and plucked sounds are ominous and scary. Its long, dark, and moody, 
and most of it is held together by that one sample. In contrast, "Love 
Suite turns into a happy, bouncy track right after the point where 
Shadow's sample ends.
As in Stem/Long Stem, Shadow knows how to slice out a completely 
benign sample from a track and turn it into something fierce. He 
doesnt go for the entire great synth riff. Hell take the beginning few 
notes, fuse it with the outro and -create something entirely his own. 
Just listen to Tangerine Dream's Invisible Limits and then check out 
Shadow's Changeling" to get a taste of the genius.

Dating ideas Feuds: West vs. Cent
The best things in life are cheap Observations on celebrity tete-a-tetes
So, you're swamped with work and the bookstore drained 
your bank account. Dorit let that get between you and that 
special someone. We can show you how to make even one 
free hour romantic and memorable. Here are a few date 
locations we suggest:
Kraus Campo
Many people live their entire lives at Carnegie Mellon in 
ignorance, never knowing about this place. Don't be one 
of them. This inconspicuous garden behind CFA, with 
its illuminated yellow pathway, becomes one of the most 
romantic locations on campus after dark. Prepare a small 
midnight picnic and we assure you your date will be 
mesmerized by the tranquility of the night.
When to go: After 10 p.m.
What to eat: Pack a picnic basket full of sandwiches, chicken 
salad, fruit, and dessert.
How to get there: Walk up from Hunt toward CFA. It is right 
in between Tepper and CFA.
Cathedral of Learning
You probably heard of this one before, but it really is 
spectacular. The view from the 24th floor is not only 
breathtaking, but also enchanting, exuding a romantic aura. 
When to go: After dark.
What to eat: You can make this either casual or formal: Grab 
some quick food from Kiva Han on the way or prepare your . 
romantic interest a special meal at your place later.
How to get there: Walk up Forbes Avenue toward the 
University of Pittsburgh. Keep a look out on your right  you 
can't miss it.
Mount Washington
Mount Washington is viable only if you have a few extra hours 
to spare. Pittsburgh might elicit a "blah" from most people 
on campus, but that in no way undermines the beauty of its 
skyline  which can be seen from atop this hill. Take the 
historic Monongahela incline up from Station Square.
When to go: When you have two or three hours to spare. 
How to get there: From Forbes and Morewood, board 
any bus heading downtown. Get off at Fifth Avenue and 
Wood Street. Transfer to a 41E from there, or walk across the 
Smithfield Street Bridge to Station Square.
Andy Warhol Museum
Don't make the "whatever" face just yet. During the daytime, 
this museum is one of the best choices for a date. It will help 
you make a lasting impression on your date, who might be 
used to dates at frat parties and obscene grinding as a way of 
expressing affection.
When to go: Late afternoon.
What to eat: Finish this "artsy trip with dinner at a small 
caf.
How to get there: Take an inbound 500 bus from Fifth and 
Morewood and get off at Isabella and Sandusky streets on the 
North Side.

The rap beef  endless antagonism between the hip-hop 
stars of the day  is one of raps most delightfully enduring 
traditions. Hip-hop would be frightfully dull without East 
Coast vs. West Coast, Biggie vs. Tupac, Jay-Z vs. Nas, or 
Eminem vs. everyone else. To this illustrious heritage we can 
add a new entry: Kanye West vs. 50 Cent, who both released 
new albums last week.
Although modesty and hip-hop go together like Britney 
Spears and dignity, Fiddy made an unusually bold declaration 
at the start of the week: If Kanye West sells more records 
than 50 Cent on September 11, I'll no longer [perform] music. 
Ill write music and work with my other artists but I won't put 
out any more solo albums.
That oblique put-down is hardly the worst bit of antagonism 
ever served up  Ive heard more vicious yo momma" jokes
 but still, I have to ask: What have Mr. West and 50 (Mr. 
Cent?) ever done to each other? I dont think Kanye is behind 
any of 50's bullet wounds, nor was Fiddy the driving source of 
Hurricane Katrina, which prompted West to proclaim in front 
of a hilariously flustered Mike Myers that "George Bush hates 
black people.
My theory? This is a purely fabricated battle" between 
two of raps biggest  and whiniest  stars, all to attract 
attention and boost record sales, a ruse that is painfully 
obvious when you climb the corporate ladder and find that the 
same company, Universal Entertainment, has a stake in both 
artists. If this scheme works  and with a combined 750,000 
record sales in one day, it looks like it did  we can expect 
to see other fabricated beefs dot the pop culture landscape in 
desperate attempts to extend those precious 15 minutes. Here 
are predicted beefs to watch out for in the coming months:
Two and a Half Men vs. The Office: The not-Charlie Sheen 
star of Americas worst and most popular comedy will start 
slinging arrows at NBCs series The Office on his next talk 
show circuit to fend off falling ratings. Wheres the star 
power? Theres a bunch of nobodies on The Office! We have 
the steady, beloved influence of Charlie Sheen and me, that 
other dude, hell say from Oprah's couch. "Who wants to 
watch a show about working in an office anyway? Nothing 
ever happens. Boring."
Dan Brown vs. Stephen King: Looking to gather some 
attention in advance of his upcoming novel, Dan Brown, 
author of The Da Vinci Code, will post a cryptic message, "A 
BECK PITHINESS THING," to his website. The market for 
adult contemporary crap lit will be forever shaken when the 
CIA, whose only notable skill these days is solving Dan Brown 
mysteries, discovers that the message is an anagram for 
STEPHEN KING IS A BITCH.
Dennis Kucinich vs. Democratic presidential 
candidates: Flush with confidence thanks to his inexplicably 
hot wife (also half his age), Kucinich will bring some muchneeded zest to the pointless early debates by declaring, 
Hillary Clinton hates black people!"
Apples, Oranges vs. cliched comparisons: Tired of being 
typecast as cliched foils, Apples and Oranges will announce 
a new merger of equals with a YouTube video: Apples and 
Oranges are both sweet, tart, healthy, hand-picked fruits. 
When people say, Its like comparing apples to oranges, 
theyre comparing things that are, like, 99 percent similar.  
Why not compare apples to broccoli? Or oranges to Athena, 
daughter of Zeus? Get creative, people!"
Perez Hilton vs. Becky Johnston, an employee at 
a nearby Starbucks: When barista Becky Johnston 
accidentally forgets the raspberry drizzle on gossip 
hound Perez Hiltons latte next week, Hilton will jump to 
attack not only the unsuspecting coffee-slinger, but also 
Americas most ubiquitous corporation. Expect a series of 
withering put-downs such as More like StarSUCKS!!! and 
Becky=Poooo! crudely appended to wire photography 
with MS Paint. Classy.
Roller Derby vs. Disney On Ice: This one explains itself: 
Who wouldn't tune in to watch a girl on rollerblades going 
by the name Punky Bruiser" tackle Sleeping Beauty? I'm 
patenting this one right now.

Pittsburgh Zoo welcomes polar bears
New exhibit, Waters Edge, features arctic predators
In the Shadow of the Moon
Wednesday, Sept. 19 
7:30
In case $1 is too much to spend 
on a movie, tonight theres one 
for free. Youre invited to enjoy a 
screening of In the Shadow of the 
Moon, a documentary about the 
Apollo space program featuring 
NASA footage and astronauts 
testimonies. And look at it this way:
Even if the moon landing was fake 
and the astronauts were consistently 
plastered, a film about all of that 
would still be pretty entertaining.
Pick up tickets in the CIT Deans 
Office, Scaife Hall 110, between 
8:30 a.m. and 5 p.m.
The Professional
Thursday, Sept. 20
8 10 12
A big action movie with a lot 
of emotional drama. A hit man 
takes in a 12-year-old Natalie 
Portman so she can gain 
revenge on Gary Oldman (a.k.a. 
Sirius Black). The Professionals 
plot seems to be an excuse 
for fancy gunfights in between 
some actual acting. A great 
film to go see if you want a 
decent movie, or even a bunch 
of shooting. Portman has good 
chemistry with the hit man, Jean 
Reno, and while Oldman may 
be over the top its still a movie 
worth seeing for only $1.
Reign Over Me
Saturday, Sept. 22 
7:45 10 12:15
Adam Sandler loses both 
his family and his job due to 
9/11 and turns to old college 
roommate Don Cheadle for 
support. A supposedly touching 
movie about two men helping 
each other out of their crappy 
lives, Reign Over Me is a roller 
coaster, going from extremely 
touching to intense (with Adam 
Sandler freaking out) and back 
to the tearjerker that Sandler 
was going for all along. Reign 
Over Me is not a traditional 
Sandler movie, and its not a lifechanging, eye-opening movie 
either. This may be a good way 
to waste time, but it would not 
be my first pick on a Saturday 
night.
The Exorcist
Sunday, Sept. 23 
7:30 10 12:30
The ultimate psychological 
thriller. Innocent young girl being 
possessed by demonic spirits 
and, of course, an exorcism. 
Need I say more? One of the 
scariest movies of all time, it still 
holds up after three decades. 
Dont forget a little dirtiness with 
a crucifix. But I wont spoil it.
Knocked Up
Friday, Sept. 21 
7:30 10 12:30
After the success of the The 
40 Year Old Virgin, someone 
decided to let Judd Apatow and 
his friends loose on camera. Not 
a bad idea. Think of it as The 40 
Year Old Virgin, except instead 
of Steve Carrell you get Greys 
Anatomys Katherine Heigl  
and while I love her on Greys 
Anatomy, she is just not as 
suited for this type of comedy. 
Still, Knocked Up is a must-see 
if you even remotely liked The 
40 Year Old Virgin (or Superbad, 
which was directed by a CMU 
alum), or if youre just depressed 
and want to see a guy like Seth 
Rogen get the pretty girl. Just 
be sure to close your eyes for 
the baby crowning, or you may 
lose your appetite.

The Pittsburgh Zoos newest exhibit, Water's Edge, 
features a fictional pier town complete with boats, fish 
markets, and houses. Its also the new home of a pair of 
polar bears.
The exhibits goals are to educate its visitors as well as 
provide the bears with a suitable habitat. Water's Edge 
contains three primary exhibits, featuring pairs of polar 
bears, sea lions, and sea otters.
The exhibit contains facts such as how polar bears can 
travel at rates up to 25 miles an hour, and that a male polar 
bear can reach a weight of more than 1500 pounds. A sign 
listing Pier Town's population statistics shows an increase 
in the human population directly correlating to a decrease 
in the polar bear population. Likewise, the exhibit provides 
facts about the living situation of polar bears in the wild.
Polar bears are specifically studied by scientists because 
they function as the top predators in the Aictic and are 
the largest land carnivores. As stated by the zoo, it is 
more important now than ever before to study, conserve, 
and assist arctic populations because of the direct effects 
of global warming on their habitat. Polar bears, which 
are marine mammals, are affected by global warming 
because they live primarily on sea ice. However, they are
also affected by pollutants in the arctic regions because of 
their high position on the food chain; pollutants ingested 
by smaller organisms are eventually ingested by the polar 
bears.
Water's Edge wraps around the front of the 
aquarium. The exhibit allows viewers 
to see the polar bears from multiple 
angles, with a huge landscape of 
rocks and pools of water, as well as 
an underwater tunnel for viewing the 
polar bears from below as they swim 
overhead.
Water's Edge was designed with the 
intention of creating a realistic and 
natural setting for the polar bears. When 
construction is finished, the zoo will add 
two walruses to the exhibit.

nore fair-trade coffee 
nich often touts itself 
air-trade coffee seller, 
t: La Prima Espresso 
3 location in the Strip 
to the popular Wean 
Hall location.
When people think of coffeehouses, they may 
think of plush, comfy couches, relaxing lighting, 
and soft music. Now imagine exactly the opposite, 
and youve got the best coffee shop in Pittsburgh. 
Benvenuto a La Prima Espresso.
Contrary to popular belief, La Prima Espresso 
actually does exist outside of Wean Hall, and it has 
since 1988. The original location for La Prima is 205 
21st St. in the Strip District.
Standing room only
La Prima stands in stark contrast to the major 
coffeehouse chains. Its surprisingly modest 
accommodations create a sort of old-world feel, 
and the effect looks straight out of Italy. The inside 
of the caf is standing room only with high tables, 
old carpeting, and scant decorations; plastic chairs 
crowd the sidewalk outside the storefront. (There's 
actually more seating at La Prima in Wean than the 
original.) La Primas lack of extravagance serves as 
a loud reminder that it really is all about the coffee. 
La Prima features coffee and espresso so flavorful 
that even a two-sugar-and-cream coffee drinker can 
drink it black.
"A coffee place really provides a nice gathering 
place, La Prima owner and founder Sam Patti said. 
I have friends that say 'I dont get it; whats the 
big deal about Starbucks? It's actually a really nice 
place to relax. It's like the coffee is there, but they 
sell the atmosphere."
The coffee
But what about the coffee? Many of the things on 
the Starbucks menu have more stuff in them than 
actual coffee, and you would be hard pressed to find 
the same at La Prima. The menu boasts a maximum 
of 25 items, most of which come in one or two sizes, 
and there is no such thing as a 20-ounce anything. 
Best of all, the entire menu is in Italian  patrons 
can choose from caffe latte, cioccolata calda, 
espresso doppio, and more.
Great coffee has been the goal for La Prima 
Espresso since its inception in 1988. In fact, Patti 
originally had plans to use the 21st Street location 
to sell high-quality espresso machines. The 
Espresso and coffee machines that La Prima sells 
come from two of Italys finest manufacturers, but
La Prima sells high quality American coffeemakers 
as well.
Since 1988, La Prima has evolved into a thriving 
business for the sale of coffee and coffeemakers, as 
well as a bustling caf open seven days a week. The 
store sells wholesale coffee and does other business 
with many distributors, and even locally owned 
shops.
La Prima also has an office coffee program. Office 
coffee tends to be, well, horrible, but La Prima offers 
seminars so office workers can learn how to brew 
good coffee using premium beans and machines.
For real coffee-loving individuals, there is the 
Coffee of the Month Club, in which members can 
enjoy different roasts and blends delivered right 
to their doors, either ground or whole beans. The 
beans come from countries all around the world so 
members can taste a variety of international coffee.
Despite the obvious differences in dcor, La Prima 
and Starbucks do have a few things in common. 
Both have devoted clients who love to go into the 
shop to relax, hang out with friends, and drink 
coffee.
Sustainability
La Prima Espresso is also a certified organic roaster, 
meaning the coffee is grown without the use of 
pesticides or herbicides. It is the only organic coffee 
roaster in Pittsburgh, and only one of two in the 
entire state of Pennsylvania. Most importantly, La 
Prima uses fair trade coffee. Fair trade essentially 
cuts out the middleman between producers and 
suppliers, thus allowing the farmers and coffee 
producers to get more of the money they deserve. 
We are absolutely fair trade organically certified, 
Patti said. How we do business is dictated by the 
standards of fair trade practices.
Although fair trade saves money by cutting 
out intermediate traders, the money does not 
necessarily all go to the grower or producer. Fair 
trade provides a floor price so that the growers and 
producers have sustainable income. In the short 
run, it tries to guarantee that the farmer will get a 
fair amount for his coffee, Patti said.
Fair-trade certification also goes hand in hand
with green practices. According to TransFair 
USA, a third-party organization that works with 
suppliers and manufacturers, fair trade guarantees 
that the farmers registered in the International 
Fair Trade Register use eco-friendly practices 
such as composting, reforestation, and terracing 
when growing their products. According to Patti, 
becoming fair trade certified was a natural step 
for La Prima. Many of the employees, friends, and 
families strongly believed in fair trade and organics. 
I think the word we use is sustainability, he said.
Coffee on campus
Around 1994, La Prima Espresso joined the 
Carnegie Mellon vendor circuit with its cart in 
Wean Hall. Although the university branch of La 
Prima lacks the Italian authenticity of the original, 
its still undoubtedly popular. Its been wonderful 
for us. Weve enjoyed working there, Patti said. 
According to Patti, much of the demand was made 
by international students used to espresso, and 
sleep-deprived computer science majors.
The menu at Weans La Prima is slightly more 
Americanized, with things like Americanos and 
chai tea lattes, in addition to lunch options like 
soups and sandwiches. I think its probably [that] 
the clientele has different needs," Patti said about 
the different menus. "I don't think we push very 
hard with espresso at Carnegie Mellon because 
you cant get it in a ceramic cup, and espresso in a 
paper cup just isn't the same."
Interestingly enough, La Prima was not Pattis first 
experience with Carnegie Mellon. I taught one 
time for a semester at Carnegie Mellon, he said. 
The Italian teacher was out for a while and they 
asked me to come teach Italian."
So, if youre looking to branch out from your tall, 
triple, non-fat, no-whip cinnamon dolce latte (with 
ice), head over to the Strip District for a more 
authentic experience.
We wanted to make a place where going to the 
coffee shop is part of your daily routine like in Italy, 
Patti said. And though Pittsburgh may never feel 
like Italia, you cant get any closerthan La Prima 
Espresso.

location on East Carson Street 
may be too far for lunch, so for 
great sushi in a hurry, visit the UC 
to choose various types of sushi, 
including California and spicy tuna 
rolls. Thank goodness that as of 
spring 2006, you can get sushi on 
a block.
Showcase Salads: The salad 
bar in the UC is a great place to 
stop and get your own customdesigned salad. With fresh 
toppings like mushrooms, bean
sprouts, soybeans, and a variety 
of meats and cheeses, it is easy 
to create the perfect salad. 
Choose fresh fruit, a cup of soup, 
and a drink with the entre, and 
youve got a well-balanced meal
 and a block, for that matter.
La Prima Espresso raspberry 
meles: Whats something 
good to have with coffee in the 
morning? Why not try a raspberry 
mele at La Prima? Flat and 
somewhat round, the raspberry
jelly is sandwiched in between 
two layers of flaky, buttery, crispy 
pastry. Its glazed with a little 
sugar on top, and the result is a 
little slice of heaven.
Maggie Murph cinnamon 
sticky buns: Although maybe not 
as good as Cinnabons, Maggie 
Murph Caf cinnamon buns fresh 
out of the oven in the morning 
make for a yummy wake-up for 
anyone with a sweet tooth. Later 
in the day, enjoying one of these
sticky snacks is a simple matter 
of putting it in the microwave for a 
few seconds to regain that melty, 
gooey goodness.
Skibo frozen yogurt: When 
seeking out low-calorie deserts, 
you cant go wrong with Skibos 
fat-free frozen yogurt. Its just like 
soft serve ice cream, minus the 
fat. With different flavors almost 
every day, you cant go wrong 
with this sinless dessert. Add 
cookies on top for a crunchy
treat, or twist two flavors together 
to get great contrasting tastes.

pillbox 09.17.07

---------------------------------------------------

Did you know?
Sept. 25,1907
Random messages are scattered 
throughout The Tartan warning new 
students not to drink the Pittsburg" 
(yes, thats how they used to speil it) 
water. A message follows instructing the 
reader to buy next weeks Tartan, which 
sold for a whopping 10 cents an issue. 
Its an interesting marketing technique, 
but I personally wonder more about the 
warnings against drinking the water.
A Tartan article claims that football 
E~Z(\ embodies all of the following: spirit, 
. )i I loyalty, and comradeship. In 2007, 
however, we might have to make a few
Sept 24 1957 rev's'ons< such as replacing "loyalty with dog fighting and comradeship 
with cruising for sex on the DL. Spirit? 
That can stay.
Sept. 14,1982
One student complains in a letter to the 
editor that students bringing personal 
computers to campus will be a bad 
idea, believing that it will further alienate 
students from each other (the few 
terminals they had were just moved to 
separate spaces). He suggests making 
a room full of word processors to bring 
students together. This suggestion 
sounds like the precursor to the clusters. 
Maybe this guy had a point.
Sept. 15, 1997
A Forum article complains that the 
policy restricting class meetings 
between 4:30 and 6:30 p.m. isnt being 
enforced. The writer believed that too 
many exceptions were being made and 
classes allowed to be scheduled during 
that time. Sounds a lot like one of this 
years student body election campaign 
issues.
Sept. 23, 2002
In a Forum article, one writer complains 
about the cost of meals (and the meal 
plan) and the low quality of food. 
Among other issues, such as gay rights 
and the remembrance of 9/11, it may 
seem trivial, but once you read that Pitt 
students could choose to have a meal 
plan as cheap as $900, it seems much 
more fitting.
Sept. 25, 2006
After having no official mascot for the 
university, a task force was appointed 
to choose a mascot and end the 
universitys mascot identity crisis. 
Among the possibilities were the Scottie 
dog and the bagpiper. It was a tough 
choice: a cute (but fierce) dog or a guy 
in a kilt? Decisions, decisions.

Feist makes it to Carnegie [Music] Hall
Broken Social Scene alum promotes second CD, The Reminder
Canadian singer-songwriter Leslie Feist performed at 
Carnegie Music Hall last Thursday as part of a four-city tour 
to promote her sophomore album, The Reminder. Feist, who 
got her start in the band Broken Social Scene, released her 
first solo album in 2004, and gained notoriety with the single 
Mushaboom," featured in Lacoste perfume commercials.
Released in May 2007, The Reminder follows in the footsteps 
of the first release with eclectic, bluesy songs written by the 
singer. The track list contains upbeat pop numbers like, I 
Feel It All" and "1234" (currently in ads for the new iPod nano), 
as well as more jazz-influenced songs such as "My Moon My 
Man" and "Brandy Alexander." Guest producers from Canada, 
France, and Germany give many of the songs a different 
sound, yet all of the material is unified by Feist's ethereal 
voice, the focal point of every song.
Feists live performance on Thursday was no exception. 
Entranced by Feist's lyrics and voice, the audience members 
often fell silent, and Feist even asked them to get up and 
cheer at one point. Challenging Carnegie Music Halls formal 
environment, she encouraged her audience to pretend you 
are at your favorite sticky-floored night club in Pittsburgh."
Feist asked the audience to participate several other times 
during her performance. She divided the audience into three 
parts, assigning each the note of a chord, in addition to letting 
the audience sing the backup for her well-known songs.
Although she is most known for her voice, Feist surprised 
those of us unfamiliar with her other talents  she ripped 
on the guitar and accompanied herself on piano for two of
her songs. Vocally, Feist kept her listeners on the edge of 
their seats with her jazz improvisation and her well-known 
descending octave trill oh-oh-oh-oh (for example, before the 
choruses in I Feel It All) that she slipped in almost every one 
of her songs.
Aside from her talent, the most pleasant part of the evening 
was Feists warm personality and her ability to converse with 
the audience. This was a nice contrast to the lead singer of 
the opening band, Rogue Wave, who was barely audible as 
he mumbled between songs. Feist was complimentary of 
her fans, Pittsburgh, and even the venue. How do you get 
to Carnegie Hall? she joked about the venue, You practice. 
Well, it looks like we practiced! To a fan who screamed out 
to Feist that she should wake up a man whod fallen asleep in 
the first row, Feist responded, "Its alright. He can sleep  I 
sing lullabies. We can get him a pillow backstage if hed like.
Maybe it was the comfy seats of Carnegie Music Hall; the 
high, detailed ceilings; even the old organ pipes that served 
as a backdrop for the performance, but watching Feist 
perform was like going to a classical performance. Many 
of the songs were backed by instruments unusual to pop 
performances, like the trumpet and French horn. Feist also 
looped her own voice to create what sounded like a choir of 
Feists. But whether one or many, Feist put on a concert both 
enthralling and inspiring.

Visiting musician Feist showed off her piano skills and

King to G4. In the center of Shadyside, Pittsburgher John Aronoff plays 
a giant game of chess designed by local artist David Edwards. Last 
weekend was Shadyside's Arts Festival on closed blocks of Walnut 
Street and Ellsworth Avenue. In addition to oversized board games, 
there were modern dance performances, local art displays, and poetry 
readings.
