Council Again Rejects Membership 
In National Student Association
By F. R. Johnson
President George Marshall, in declaring the Student Council 
election of December 18 void, up
held the petition of a small inde
pendent group seeking an entire
ly new election. Marshall set the 
date of the new election as March 
11, and announced that J. K. 
OHare' will preside over Student 
Council during the period when 
Council will be without a presi
dent^ through the postponement of 
the installation of the new council.
During the two-hour long meet
ing in the Council chamber at 
the Carnegie Union, January 14, 
Carnegie Tech came within a 
breath of joining the National 
Student Association as a result of 
another of a long string of at
tempts by a number of council 
members, led by Norman Larsen, 
to gain approval of this national 
organization of student govern
ments. A motion to join the NSA 
was defeated by a 14-13 vote, and 
some observers expect that an at
tempt will be made to force this 
movement through Council after 
some of the opposition leave of
fice at the end of this semester and 
before the new members take of
fice after the March 11 elections 
Other important action taken 
during the business-filled session 
included the rejection of a peti
tion from a group of students 
demanding that Council hold an 
all-school election to determine 
whether a majority of the stu
dent body approves of Council ex
pending council funds for their 
annual banquet.
The close vote defeating the 
NSA motion followed a short dis
cussion of the issue during which 
Council members Ulrich and Reed 
defended the NSA. Representative 
Ulrich declared that the NSA 
is not a union, but simply an or
ganization of student govern
ments. Continuing, he said, The 
NSA is just getting started and 
Tech has a chance to get in on the ground floor.
A discussion opened by a peti
tion protesting the expenditure of 
funds for the Student Council 
banquet held Friday evening,

Independents Explain 
Protest Of Election
Poor Publicity, Ballot Errors 
Result In Fraternity Victory
Attempting to locate the lead
ers of the new independent group 
which successfully protested the Student Council election, the Tar
tan visited councilman J. K. 
OHare at his room in Henderson 
hall, and there also met William Johns, junior management en
gineer, and John Anderson and 
Robert Crago, junior electricals.
OHare opened the discussion by 
noting that the group was simply 
representing a number of men in 
the dormitories who had talked 
things over, and that when 
things came to a head, we were 
the ones to take them to the 
Dean.Things, turned out to be that 
the fraternities had put 12 men 
in and that there were ballot and 
poll misrepresentations.These 12 men, explained An
derson, dont represent a crosssection of the school.A further point, OHare pul 
in, was that the small turnout 
was due largely to the poor pub
licity, in that notice was not given 
far enough in advance.
Johns then made the point that 
the group was not interested in 
the technicalities involved, that 
their primary interest was in see
ing Student Council become a fully representative body which it 
is not at the present time. We feel
Education at CIT will probably have new price tags in
Septemberhigher per year by $150 in Fine Arts, $80 in Mar
garet Morrison, and $50 in the College of Engineering if the 
Board of Trustees concurs with the Executive Board estimate 
that these increases will be necessary if the budget is to be 
balanced.This new realignment of fees with swiftly rising costs?provoked no surprise when it was 
announced at the Student Confer
ence committee dinner meeting of 
Thursday, January 15, which was 
held in the special dining room 
adjoining Skibo.
Remarking that tuition rises
are getting to be habitual, Dr. 
Doherty explained that the Ex
ecutive Board had accepted these 
proposed increases as given in a 
report of its Committee on Fees 
and Charges in order to permit the 
required balanced budget.
Before passing the measure on 
to the Board of Trustees, however, 
the Executive Board added a rec
ommendation for increased schol
arships so that students depend
ing on them will be in approxi
mately the same position as be
fore.
The only bit of good financial 
news which the president was able 
to supply as he unrolled a story 
which will mean increased diffi
culty for all students and perhaps 
the end of their studies at Car
negie Tech for some, was that the 
matriculation fee has been elimi
nated. The diploma fee still re
mains.
When asked if the Trustees 
would approve the new increases, 
Dr. Doherty replied wryly: They 
can approve it or they can in
struct us to cut the budget.
In addition to learning that 
their schooling would cost more 
next year, senior engineers at
tending the Conference commit
tee meeting were informed by 
Provost Elliot Dunlap Smith that, 
starting next semester with you 
men, term papers of goodly 
length would henceforth be re
quired.
The Provost spoke in terms of 
40 to 50 pages for history courses,

Rev. Hutchinson and Zionist Chief 
Discuss Palestine Problem Here
Discussing The Problem of Palestine with the purpose of' 
throwing light rather than heat on the subject, Reverend Frank 
Hutchison of the Shadyside Presbyterian church and Dr. Benzion 
Netanyhu, executive director of the American division of the United 
ZionistRevisionist party, will take opposing points of view at a 
general assembly on Tuesday, January 27, at 11:30 a. m. in the
Little Theater of Fine Arts. ?-----------------------------------------------
Brought together by Dr. Dougj ern Zionist movement to that unlas Miner, Director of Student! stable country and its peoples.
Personnel and Welfare, in accord
ance with the schools policy of 
frequently providing assemblies 
for the student body which will be 
of the greatest general interest, 
both speakers have been in con
tact with disputed Palestine and 
have almost diametrically opposed 
opinions of the value of the modReverend Hutchison, now as
sistant minister at the Shadyside 
Presbyterian church, was in Pal
estine during 1945-1946, and there 
visited the various Zionist activi
ties, including the potash reclama
tion plant on the Dead Sea near 
historic Jericho, the Negev desert 
area, awarded *o tH<* Jews under
the UN partition plan, and many 
of the experimental farming set
tlements.
His discussion on Tuesday will 
reflect the opinions which he 
brouglit back from his visit to Pal
estine  that modern Zionism is 
dangerous for the Jews, and 
that it accentuates the racist 
thinking which is the curse of na
tionalism. He noted, however, 
that he is not an Arab apologist 
and that he is not agin some
body or something.
Prior to receiving his present 
churchly position, Reverend 
Hutchison attended the Union

that there should be at least a 
few independents on the Council 
to look, after the interests of the 
independent students.
He further noted that every
one was led to believe that 
was necessary to vote for 12 can
didates.
This, of course, gave the fra
ternity men votes which they 
might otherwise not have receiv
ed.
When the discussion turned to 
the action of Citcom Clan in put
ting up a ticket for the past elec
tion, OHare commented: I think 
that Citcom took a big step . . .
A darn good one, Crago interjected.
. . .in presenting a ticket of 
able men from both fraternity and 
independent groups. The fact that 
it came from an independent or
ganization and that it was thrown 
back at them was a.kick in the face, which ...
Which isnt beneficial to good 
student government, finished Anderson.
And which wont encourage them to make any further steps to 
get along with the fraternities, added Crago.
The fact is, said OHare, that 
they were the first group to admit 
that there are able men in both 
groups. Evidently the fraternities 
agreed that only the fraternitymen were able.
Crago closed the interview on a 
pointed note: Up through the 
Tartan mistake, I think that the 
Elections commijipe acted in good 
faith. But it is^mcortunate that 
Student Council cant run a con
stitutional election.
Tuition Notice
Although the tuition raises 
have not yet been passed by 
the Board of Trustees, they 
will probably go through in 
their present form. Amount
ing to $150 a year in Fine Arts, 
$80 in Margaret Morrison, and 
$50 in the College of Engineer
ing and Science, they will not 
go into effect until September.

The bridge team which will 
represent Carnegie Tech in the 
annual Intercollegiate Bridge 
Tournament will be chosen in 
a qualifying round at the Union 
on Friday, January 23, at 6:30

EditorialTuitionGoing Up!
Tuition has done it again.
There are those who will protest the ine
quities of the Administration and who will 
demand an immediate attempt to undo the 
outrage. We hope that by now these people 
are in the minority, for the entire nation is 
having the same trouble with virtually everj - 
one who supplies them with their needs.
The professor of advanced mathematics 
must eat fully as well as the grocer, and the 
replacement of worn-out and damaged equip
ment cannot be postponed indefinitely.
We can only express a hope which we fear 
is somewhat ephemeral, that increased scholar
ships will help to alleviate some of the dif
ficulties which this latest and rather consider
able increase will cause in the Fall.
Concerning NSA
The apparently unkillable issue of whether 
or not to join the National Student Associa
tion is still with us.
The values of the organization are still 
under dispute, and Council will apparently be 
asked to consider the problem once again.
Rather than discuss NSA itself, however, 
which we believe to be a question of non-vital 
importance, we prefer to direct attention to 
the manner in which the discussion so far has 
been carried out.
Chief among the arguments advanced 
against NSA has been the charge of Communist 
affiliations. The labeling of NSA as potentially 
such was of primary importance in handing 
the issue its first defeat.
And sinc.e people who have no particular 
axe to grind are beginning to suspect that 
Soviet Russia is actually not fully sincere in 
its intentions, and that the various Communist 
parties throughout the world are incompletely 
loyal to their respective governments, this ac
cusation becomes particularly unpleasant.
If there is only one thing which engineer
ing teaches, it is that every situation must be 
examined fully, and entirely on its own merits 
before a verdict for action is attempted.
The half-baked statements and intricate 
juggling of misinformation which have char
acterized the NSA argument so far ill-becomes 
the Carnegie Institute of Technology.
Says Who?

Henry Wallaces plunge into the crowded pond 
of presidential aspirants brings no joy to most 
politicians, but, it seems to me, the rest of us 
stand to gain by this move, whatever our politi
cal sympathies. It is understood that there is very 
little chance of facing rigors of a Wallace in the 
White House. Having ruled out this possibility, 
there are plenty of advantages 
that accrue fnom Mr. Wallaces 
:andidacyespecially for liberals. 
An American liberal is pri
marily a guardian against social 
polarization. Every democratic 
way of lifeand ours is no ex
ceptiontends to lose its elastici
ty. In our backwoods days it was 
| a very common matter for a man 
of humble origin to take a seat 
with the mighty; today it is still 
possible, and we are yet treated to 
the sight of a coal miners son 
rising to the presidency of a large corporation 
like U. S. Steel.
But customs and vested interests are slowly 
staking out restricted claims to opportunity. To 
put it another way, if Horatio Alger were here 
today he would have to work harder for story 
material than was necessary in his own day. It 
is the aim of a political liberal to expand free
dom of opportunity  economic, educational and 
civic opportunityand to protect it from the in
roads of restrictive groups.
The entrance of a third party on the national 
scene will tend to clarify the issues for liberals, 
as well as for everyone elsesimply because poli
tical competition will be more intense. The elim
ination of racial bias and segregation will once 
more become a political issue. Such problems as 
the retention of income tax at a high level, the 
question of economic planning for the future, the 
cause of the present high prices, will have to be 
discussed squarely now. No more of the ridicu
lous claims that a few wheat speculators have 
alone doubled the price of food. Mr. Wallaces 
shrill attacks against Wall Street politics will 
require a more cogent retort than Those bad, bad 
speculators are doing it all.
Consider the European Recovery Program. Al
though Mr. Wallace opposes it, the American pub
lic will continue to realize that it is an indispen
sable expresion of a firm policy towards Russia. 
On the other hand, some of Wallaces criticisms 
that it is being used to further economic imperial
ism are justified. A public airing of the unwritten 
policies which exchange dollars for economic con[Continued on page 6]
Right Face!
By Robert Charpie
I realize that WCIT is new at the job of being 
a college radio station. But this fact alone does 
not explain why our radio station cant produce 
worthwhile entertainment when other college sta
tions can.
I dont mean to criticize every program WCIT 
offers, but some of them need revision. There 
seems to be no lack of variety nor any dearth of 
good ideas; the .weakness lies in the production.
Last week I appeared as a contestant on a quiz 
show, which was designed along the lines of a 
Battle of the Sexes. I think the idea behind 
such a program is fine because it provides an en
tertaining variety when mixed with recordings. 
However, I seriously criticize the infantile manner 
in which this program was run.
As per instructions the quiz master and all of 
the contestants arrived at the studio ten minutes 
before show time5:00. The student in charge of 
the program was late, and when he still hadnt 
arrived at 5:15 the staff decided to go on the air 
with what surplus questions were on hand. Profes
sor Kammin, who acted as quiz-master, did an 
excellent job of giving the program the proper 
atmosphere. It was a very informal question bee 
which still retained an air of politesse. ,
Everything was going fine until the gentleman 
who was supposed to be in charge arrived at 5:30. 
He burst through the studio door with a loud 
whoop, snatched the microphone from Professor 
Kammin, and informed the listeners that he was 
late. He continued to jabber nonsense into the 
mike until he got his coat off and removed the 
balance of the questions from his pockets.

Things To Come
On Stage
By Marty Dorff
By now, the news that The 
Great Magician is something to 
cheer about must have percolated 
to the entire campus. For myself 
I think I enjoyed this production 
more than any Ive seen in four 
years at school.
The show is a re-creation of the 
old commedia dell arte, which 
took the form of improvisations 
based on a series of stock charac
ters.
The production of The Great 
Magician, written and directed 
by the imaginative Mr. Carra, is 
wonderfully successful in captur
ing the flavor, or at least what I 
imagine to be the flavor, of the 
old commedia. Slavish imitation 
of a vanished tradition would have 
spoiled everything. Instead of 
gaiety and exuberance there 
would be only academic correct
ness. But Mr. Carra has translated 
the commedia into modern terms 
of speech and action which allow 
the audience to experience a live 
art rather than an exhumed ca
daver. What results is the ances
tor of the modern vaudeville show 
 a sixteenth century burlesque 
with Coviello playing the part of 
first banana. It was a great treat, 
drinking this new wine from an 
old bottle.
I left the second performance I 
saw with the feeling that the first 
cast was several cuts above the 
second, not only in individual 
technical proficiency, but also in 
elan and ensemble spirit. I must 
admit, however, that I saw the 
first cast first, and that I could
not possibly expect to experience 
the same excitement - and fresh
ness the second night as I did 
when it was all new to me. Fur
thermore, audience reaction and 
participation is very important to 
the buoyancy of such a show, and 
the opening night audience was 
far more receptive than that of 
the second performance I saw.
I cant do full justice to all of 
the fine portrayals since my space 
is limited, but I do want to men
tion those that I thought were 
outstanding. Louis Knaak almost 
stole the show with a rollicking 
appearance as Bacchus. Collette 
Crawfords graceful dancing and 
airy manner were highly appeal
ing. Wes Kenney gave an expert 
and intriguing Performance as the 
loutish Pulcinella. Emily Barnes, 
George Corrin, Bert Pollock, and 
Bill Butch were also outstanding 
in a very fine ensemble.
Most notable in the second cast 
were Sada Thompson as a fetchingly seductive coquette; William 
Leech as a pompous pedant, whose 
harangue on women was one of 
the high points of the show; and 
Joe Schlafman, who managed to 
cast a mock-sinister shadow in 
his magic scenes. Enunciation by 
the members of this cast was in 
general markedly superior to that 
by members of the first.
The costumes and masks were 
superb. They added a great deal 
to the color and festive spirit of 
the show. And a final nod to the 
musicians and the musicwith
out them, the show would cer
tainly have missed much.

Printing, Management 
Removed From E&S
Cleeton, Smith Head Departments 
In New Set-Up Under H&SS
The departments of graphic arts and management engineering 
have been transferred from the College of Engineering and Science 
to the Division of Humanistic and Social Studies, it was announced 
this morning by President Doherty.
The transferred departments will now be known as the de
partment of industrial administration and the department of print
ing administration. ?-------------------------------------------
Elliott Dunlap Smith, provost
of the college of engineering and 
science, will head the instruction 
in management, and Glen U. Cleeton, director of humanistic and 
social studies, will perform like 
duties in printing.
Beginning with the class of 
1952, the degree awards will be 
changed accordingly, but the Col
lege of Engineering and Science 
will continue to grant the degrees 
and no change in personnel, cur
ricula or education policies will 
be made in these departments.
One promotion in the new 
printing set-up was the appoint
ment of Assistant Professor 
Stanley C. Hlasta to the new of
fice of Assistant Head of the de
partment.
In approving the changes, the 
Executive Committee also set up 
two committees to administer the 
newly - transferred departments 
and to plan and develop the 
courses. These committees are to 
be headed by Provost Smith and 
Director Cleeton.
In directing the Industrial ad
ministration committee Provost 
Smith will return to a field he 
entere^ early in his career. The 
one-time personnel director and 
plant manager of two factories 
for the Dennison Manufacturing 
Company served for almost ten 
years as chairman of the division 
committee on industrial relations 
for the National Industrial Con
ference board.
A member of the management 
committee of the ASME, the Pro
vost was for a time professor of 
industrial engineering at Yale 
university.
Mr. Cleeton, who is also director 
of the evening school and summer 
programs, is a former head of the 
printing department, a member 
of the National Graphic Arts Ed
ucation Guild and a well-known 
author in printing management 
and personnel administration.
Feb. Assembly 
Will Feature 
Pacific Voyage
Kon-Tiki, the film story of 
the six Scandinavian explorers 
who achieved world-wide atten
tion last summer by drifting 420 
miles across the South Pacific on 
a raft, will be shown at the stu
dent assembly in the Little Thea
tre, on Tuesday, February 3.
The film will be supplemented 
with a lecture by Thor Heyer
dahl, leader of the expedition.
The New York Times said of 
the film, One of the great ad
venture stories of our time.
The scientific aspects of the pro
gram are included in the explana
tion by explorer Heyerdahl of the 
purpose of the expedition, which 
was to help prove by their trip 
from Peru to Polynesia on a 40 
by 15 foot raft, that pre-Incan In
dians might have traveled by rafts from South America to the South 
6eas.The film is a pictorial record of 
the entire expedition, even to se
quences of the raft at sea taken from a dinghy let out on a long 
rope. Much of the excitement is 
contained in scenes of battles 
with whale sharks, tiger sharks, 
dolphins and other deep sea fish.
Other scenes show the parrot 
which was taken along as a. mas
cot and the crash landing on a 
small coral reef in the Polynesian 
islands after 101 days at sea.

Independents Protest 
Council Fund Misuse
Stating that we actually had no 
reason to believe that any organi
zation could have the nerve to 
take such a sum of public money 
and spend it on itself, Jack 
Guyol, independent leader and 
chemistry senior, explained the 
lateness and consequent rejection 
of a petition which would have 
cancelled the $250 Student Coun
cil banquet which was held Fri
day night, January 16, at the 
Carousel night club.
In detailing the reasons behind 
the initiation of the protest, Guyol 
said: A petition was started to 
induce Council to reconsider an 
action which we considered 11- 
advised.
This action involved the ap
propriation of funds which had 
been intended for the student body 
in general for the use of a closed 
group (which for all practical 
purposes had elected itself) for its 
own personal pleasure.If it had been known at the
time, he continued, that the 
money for this banquet had been 
appropriated when the original 
Student Council budget was ap
proved, our petition would have 
started then.
Bringing action on the petition 
up to date, Guyol related how the 
people working with him, having 
read in the Tartan that the ban
quet was to take place, typed up 
the petitions and obtained 188 sig
natures in approximately an hour.
The only person who refused 
to sign was a member of Student 
Council.The petition attacking the Coun
cil party was presented at the 
January meeting of that body by 
Leonard Kroko, another active 
dormitory independent. After a 
vigorous discussion, the petition 
was rejected on the grounds that 
it was invalid, not having been 
submitted within two weeks after 
Student Councils personal budget was passed.

Carnegie Institute of Tech
nology will break ground for 
its new synchro-cyclotron be
fore the end of January, weath
er permitting, on the site of 
the former KDKA transmitting 
station at Saxonburg, Pa., 28 
miles northeast of Pittsburgh, 
it was announced today by Dr. 
Robert E. Doherty, Carnegie 
president.
The new site, comprising ap
proximately 60 acres, has just 
been purchased by Tech from the 
Westinghouse Electric Corpora
tion, owners and operators of 
KDKA, who transferred their 
transmitting facilities from Sax
onburg to the present Allison 
Park, Pa. location in 1939.
Purchase price of the tract was 
not disclosed.
Although it was planned to 
build the cyclotron on the Car
negie Tech campus, school officials 
said they had decided to change 
the location to a site which would 
allow more room for expansion of 
nuclear research facilities in the 
future, should the need arise.
Situated on the property at Sax
onburg, and included in the pur
chase are the former brick trans
mitting building, containing a 
basement and ground floor, and 
two frame buildings, one of which 
will be used for storage purposes.
The former transmitting build 1 
ing, which now contains 4800 
square feet of flor space, will be 
enlarged by the addition of a new 
one-story brick wing, to be joined 
to the present structure at one 
end. The whole will form an L 
shaped building of fire resistent 
construction containing 20,000 
square feet of floor space, and will 
house a laboratory, cyclotron con
trols, and in the east end of the 
building, the atom smasher itself.
Completion of the building is 
expected by next fall, when in
stallation of the electrical parts of 
the cyclotron will be started. Most 
time-consuming part of the entire 
project  the work of completing 
the vast, complex mechanism, is 
expected to require at least one 
year.
According to Dr. Edward C. 
Creutz, associate professor of 
physics at Carnegie Tech, and administratro of the project, the cy
clotron should be in operation 
early in 1950, if deliveries of ma
terials and equipment are receiv
ed on schedule.
Total cost of the entire project, 
including the building will be in 
the neighborhood of one million 
dollars, said Carnegie officials.
With the announcement of the 
purchase of the new site came 
the revelation that the ney syn
chro-cyclotron is expected to pro
duce 350 million electron volts, 
instead of 250 million.

Holding tightly to the lead which they took in the first minute 
of the game, Carnegie Techs basketeers eked out a 36-32 win over 
Geneva in a thrilling game played in the gym on January 13.
The Covies poor shooting and the amazing marksmanship of 
the Tartans were the deciding factors, as the Skibos copped the 
decision to stop a five game losing streak.
The Skibos were off to a running start as Bob McCullugh and 
Jack Riehl tallied two quick bas-^- 
kets. The next nine points came 
on free throws with Carnegie 
grabbing five of them to go in 
front 9-4 at the ten minute mark.
After Len Bianchi ran the lead 
to seven points with a one-hander, 
the Covies began to find the range 
with their shots and narrowed the 
gap to 14-13. Joe Matsey then got 
a hot hand for the Plaid as he 
sank four shots within three min
utes. Sandwiched in with Matseys efforts was a tally by Mike 
Theodore which gave the Skibos 
a safe working lead of 24-15 at 
half-time.
Lloyd Cable, who tallied all but 
four of his teams field goals, 
traded baskets with McCullugh 
and Theodore as the second half 
opened. Cable then sent two more

TUESDAY, JANUARY 20, 1948
Leading until the final four min
utes, Carnegie Techs hoopsters 
were nosed out by Penn State 
47-39 before a large crowd in the 
gymnasium last Saturday night. 
It was a spectacular contest, easi
ly the finest game this season.
Irwin Batnick, stocky guard, 
was the big gun for the Lions as 
he propelled eight field goals 
through the hoop and emerged as 
the games high scorer with 16 
points. It was Batnicks fine floor 
play and assortment of pivot and 
two-handed overhead set shots 
that kept the Nittany Lions in the 
game during the first three quar
ters.The Lions zone defense, gener
ally regarded as one of the finest 
in intercollegiate basketball, was 
frequently peppered by the 
first half. The game was hardly 
under way before a layup by The
odore, a set shot by McCullugh 
and a brace of charity tosses by 
Riehl gave the Skibos a 6-0 lead.
The Staters narrowed the lead 
to three points but the Plaid spurt
ed for an eight point 
on a couple of one-handers by 
Riehl and a sensational tip in by 
Ellies.
At halftime the Tartans were 
out in front 25-19 and as soon as 
play resumed they built up an
other eight point lead. The Ski
bos chances received a severe 
jolt when Jack Riehl was carried 
from the floor with a sprained 
ankle. Riehl had been a bulwark 
in defense and was high scorer 
with Ellies in the first half.
With Batnick, Biery and Simon 
leading the way, the Lions mov
ed up to within three points of Carnegie by the end of the third 
quarter. After two quick baskets 
by Biery had brought about a 
deadlock, Penn State shot ahead 
for the first time in the game on 
a pivot shot by Kulp with four 
and a half minutes remaining. As 
Carnegie fought desperately for 
the winning scores, their defense 
fell apart, allowing the Lions to 
add to their winning score of 47- 
39.
In the preliminary game, the
Suppose we were buying apples  instead of tele
phone equipmentfor the people of Pennsylvania.
You would expect us to buy (a) good apples at (b) 
a favorable price. You wouldnt expect us to pay 10c 
per apple if three good apples could be bought for 
25c ... or if 300 good apples could be bought for 
$21.00.
We are guided by this same principle in buying tele
phone equipment  wire and cable, switchboards and 
insulators, telephone instruments and dial mechanisms.
We insist, above all, on good equipment, for only with 
good equipment can we provide good telephone serv
ice, and only with good equipment can cpsts be kept 
low. We seek a favorable price, for a favorable price 
also helps us to keep your telephone bills down.
Thats why we do most of our buying through Western 
Electric, supply unit of the Bell System. We know that 
Western Electric equipment  and the equipment that 
Western Electric buys elsewhere  meets our stand
ards. And because Western Electric furnishes equip
ment in such large quantities to all operating com
panies within the Bell System, we can buy what we 
need at prices substantially lower than we would have 
to pay elsewhere for equipment of like quality.
Good buying, in short, is simply one more reason why 
you have the best possible telephone service at the 
lowest possible cost.

TUESDAY, JANUARY 20, 1948THE CARNEGIE TARTAN
IM Basketball Opens 
With Thrilling Action
Intramural basketball started 
with a bang last week as all of 
the 24 competing teams saw ac
tion. The SAEs, TXs, and Betas 
were impressive in their openers 
but 3A and Emanon provided the 
hottest game of the infant season.
Leading by one point, the Emanons latched on the ball in 3A 
territory and made a desperate 
attempt to add another score with 
only 8 seconds remaining. Still 
fighting, the 3As took the re
bound and brought the ball up 
court to swish it through the 
cords as the final whistle sound
ed to end the contest 48-47.
Other games in the Long Shot 
league saw the Delts outshoot the 
FPHA men to win 34 to 24. In 
another close and bitter game the 
PIKAs outlasted the DUs to cop 
a 29 to 26 victory. Griffin garner
ed 20 points and Kirby had 18 as 
they led the high scoring Betas to 
a 60 to 15 win over Dorm Com
bine.
Kaelin found the hoop for 18 
tallies as his TX cagers outscored the Sigma Nu Bs 45 to 20. Joe 
Tikey had 12 points for the los
ers. The final game of last week 
gave the ATOs a close 27 to 22 
triumph as they tumbled the Kap
pa Sig Bs.
High scoring honors went to 
SAE and the 7 Aces. These boys scored 114 points in 32 minutes 
as the SAEs won 69 to 45. Jewell 
had *2.1 points and Klingensmith 
hooped 22 for the victors. The set 
shot league also had the low scor
ing game when the Tau Delts lost 
to the Beta Sigs 26 to 14.
The Kappa Sig A team found 
the Beta Bs too sharp and finish
ed on the short end of a 29-24 
count. Wilds shots were far from 
Wild as he pitched 8 buckets to 
help Citcom topple the 49ers to 
the tune of 51-20. The Phi Kaps 
jumped on the TX Bs to claim a
38-16 win for their first win. Hansen was high scorer with 12 
points for Sigma Nu in their game 
with AAA but the AAAs won 
32-26.
Bowling
Records are made to be broken 
and the intramural bowlers did 
just that last week. ATO came 
through with a 912 series to take 
the high game team score from 
Citcom. Larsen of ATO helped his 
team by contributing a 227 to this 
series, taking the lead in individual high games.
Himes of Dorm Combine bowled 
224 and Taylor of Delta Tau Del
ta No. 2 turned in a 221, also pass

Firing in their first shoulder to

varsity rifle team, under the 
guidance of M/Sgt. Reed, de
feated the Pitt team by a 1334 
to 1327 score on the CIT range 
on Friday, January 16. High 
scorers for the Plaid were Smith, 
Morrison, Bishop, Schmid and 
Jordan.
The Tartan marksmen opened 
the season on the wrong foot by 
losing a triangular postal match 
to MIT and Drexel. The week of 
January 10 found the sharp
shooters rebounding to defeat 
Rose Tech and Dayton U in an
other postal meet.

Theological Seminary and did 
graduate work at Columbia.
Leader of the American wing of 
the United Zionist-Revisionists, 
one of four major international 
Zionist parties and the second 
largest in Palestine, Dr. Netanyhu 
is a graduate of the Hebrew Uni
versity in Palestine, once edited 
a daily newspaper in that country, 
and was co-editor of one of its 
foremost literary magazines.
His arguments will be based on 
the theses that in the face of the 
Arab determination to destroy the 
Jewish position in Palestine, the 
open hostility of Great Britain, 
and the indifference of the United 
States, Palestine is in gravest dan
ger from the Arab states.
That the only way to alleviate 
the danger is to tell the govern
ment of the United States that it 
is its duty in accord with its moral 
and political obligations to arm 
and equip the young men of Pal
estine is one of the conclusions 
which he will draw from his 
postulates.
Based on the experience of 
commentator Martin Agronskys 
lecture at which an overflow 
crowd had to be accommodated in 
the Exhibition room with a public 
address system, students have 
been advised to reach the Little 
Theater before 11:30 if they wish 
to obtain seats.
Student Council
[Continued from page 1]
January 16 at the Carousel, occu
pied the major part of the legisla
tive session.
Leonard Kroke, electrical en
gineering junior, representing the 
petition signers, stated that 190 
signatures had been obtained. 
Mr. Kroko was bombarded with 
questions from all sides following the reading of the petition. 
With all members of council in 
favor of proceeding with the ban
quet, Council members Reed and 
Naylor led the defense.
Budgei chairman Naylor re
ported that the money for the 
banquet was appropriated by the 
Student Council budget passed 
last fall and approved by the 
Deans office. Mr. Reed remind
ed those present that according to 
the Student Council constitution 
any petition for referendum must 
be presented to the president of 
Student Council within two weeks 
after notification by Student 
Council of any action passed, and 
that all budgets are available in 
the Deans office for inspection 
by any student for two weeks 
after they are passed.
On the strength of this consti
tutional provision, Mr. Reed mov
ed that the petition be declared 
out of order. The motion was car
ried unanimously. President Mar
shall then appointed Mr. Reed 
and Mr. Naylor to write a letter 
of explanation to the editor of the 
Tartan.
Following Mr. Elliotts request 
that Council provide the machin
ery to elect class officers, Mar
shall appointed six Council mem
bers to submit recommendations 
on the matter at the next meet
ing.
The short-lived study of food 
prices on campus was brought to 
an abrupt end. Representative 
Johnson reported that the food is 
bought at wholesale prices, and 
that the administration had ap
parently delayed the advancing 
of Skibo prices as long as pos
sible.
Student Council awarded goldjeweled keys to eleven of its mem
bers. Recipients are Jack Mclntire, Charles Duffett, Norman
Larsen, George Marshall, George 
Matthews, Bruce Murray, Jane 
Dowd, Jean Knee, Arthur Naylor, 
J. K. OHare, and Robert Sha
piro. The key-awarding policy of 
Citcom Clan was read and ap
proved.
Council gave its permission to 
the YMCA and the CWCA to 
solicit funds on campus in co
operation with the nation-wide 
World Student Service Fund 
drive. Delta Gamma sorority was 
given the go-ahead on a closed dance, January 17 at the Pitts
burgh Athletic Association.
Permission was given to the 
Beaux Arts society to hold an 
election on February 5 to select 
a queen for the Beaux Arts ball.
Following the extended discus
sion of the Council banquet, Mr. 
Gustavson recommended that 
Council take some action to re
quire the Tartan to print the min
utes of Student Council as they 
are submitted to the editor. Negley Reed, chairman of the pub
lications committee, suggested 
that the editor of the Tartan be 
invited to appear before Council 
at the next meeting to answer the 
questions arising from this is
sue. The discussion was interrupt
ed by a motion for adjournment at 
6:30.

somewhat less in economics, 
where papers would be more 
compact but harder per word, 
and three short papers for liter
ature courses.
There was no comment from 
the committee.
Dr. Doherty reported that the 
plan for consideration of the pro
posed new Alma Mater was still 
the same as before, that the in
tramural injuries compensation 
proposal was still being discussed, 
and that this years concessions to 
the University of Pittsburgh on 
the intramural football field 
wont occur again without a 
fight.After noting with pleasure that 
the SCC suggestion for increasing 
the amounts of a check which 
could be cashed at one time in the 
cashiers office had been accepted, 
the president listened to a sug
gestion that each department hold 
a seminar at the end of the year 
for the graduating seniors in 
which the latter would make con
structive suggestions relative to 
improvements of courses offered 
and instructional methods  with 
no reprisals for criticisms. The 
plan was noted down for further 
consideration.
Also proposed were coat and 
book racks for the student wash
rooms. Provost Smith seconded 
the proposal with enthusiasm, not
ing that books which he had 
placed on the floor were acci
dentally stepped on.
And the committee was treated 
to a brilliant oration on the need 
for adequate sidewalks in front 
of Welch and Scobell halls by a 
member who declined to be quot
ed.The major part of the evening, 
however, was devoted to discus
sion of such topics as the social 
relations program, public speaking 
courses and theory, and the prob
lems of engineering education.
During the latter, the Provost 
cited his conception of the two 
primary weaknesses in engineer
ing education, both of which Car
negie Techs revised programs and 
instructional methods are attempt
ing to correct.
These weaknesses, said the 
Provost, are first, that the pres
ent system trains people to do 
their stuff on demand. They forget 
that there may be another way to 
do the job and that application 
of their techniques may be dan
gerous.Secondly, the tendency of pro
fessional education is to develop 
a highly organized thought ability 
within a confined area. Once a 
man leaves this area, he forgets 
everything which he has been 
taught.
We want him to apply his edu
cation to good citizenship.

It was at this point that all good 
taste was thrown asidethe farce 
began in earnest. The first two 
questions he asked were properly 
answered. He couldnt know that, 
however, because he didnt have 
any answers.
Then as he warmed to the occa
sion he seized upon every oppor
tunity to insert a witty remark. 
Frequently these comments took 
the form of puerile puns and silly 
poetry  which on one occasion 
had an off-color tinge which was 
completely unnecessary.
Such carryings on do more harm 
than just ruining a single show. 
Each program in part sets the tone 
for the station, and one lemon like 
this one can do a lot of institu

Despite the fact that service on

British, French and Italian do
mestic politics, will help disen
chant many of our too-trusting 
citizens. A sharp cleavage that 
will reveal the issues at hand, 'and 
which will rejuvenate our emas
culated political parties, making 
them vehicles of social ideals of 
pork-barrel mutual aid societies, 
may well be the result of Henry 
Wallaces candidacy.
And if it is he will have done 
a great service to the cause of 
.American democracy, for which 
both Democratic and Republican 
liberals may be grateful.

Engineering Banquet 
Scheduled For April
Companies Asked To Donate Giftsj 
Speakers Will Be Announced Later
Preparations are now under way for the thirty-third annual 
Engineering Banquet which will be held April 10, 1948 in the ballroom of the Hotel Henry.
The Social Committee headed by Ray Schwalm and James Fla
herty are now preparing letters of solicitation to be mailed to some 
three hundred companies requesting donations of souvenirs and/or 
door prizes. They are being capably assists by a corps of volunteer 
typists. So it looks as though the*
brown bag will have to be larger 
this year (50 lb. size?).
The Committee regret that they cannot announce the names of the 
speakers at this time. The sidestories of the speakers will not be 
too severely censored. In fact, the 
hottest deal to date promises to 
bring you a speaker who will sur
pass any heard at previous ban
quets. The entertainment will be 
provided as usual by the Peg Lanagan Theatrical Agency.
Tickets will be available after 
registration in February. Sorry, 
but ladies are definitely not wel
come.
Playi
Actors Enjoy 
ing In 
Magician
In selecting The Great Magic
ian for its first offering of 1948, 
the drama department has made a 
happy choice. Written and direct
ed by Mr. Lawrence Carra of the 
drama faculty, this highly enter
taining play was presented strict
ly for enjoyment. The actors, giv
en free rein to improvise as they 
saw fit, ei joyed playing their 
roles and communicated much of 
their gaiety to the audience.
We are going to stick our neck 
out and award the orchid of the 
month to both casts as a whole, 
for everyone did an excellent 
job. The second cast was some
what hampered early in the eve
ning, for it seemed that the snow
storm had so chilled the major
ity of the theatregoers that they 
found it necessary to sit on their 
hands to  keep them warm, but 
soon the audience was in a gay 
mood. The drama students are to 
be congratulated for their won
derful performances.
For the fourth major production 
of the season, the Dramats will 
present G. B. Shaws Getting 
Married. Full of typical Shavian 
wit and satire, the play is a pro
longed discussion of the various 
aspects of marriage seen through 
the action of the rather extreme 
characters. Getting Married is 
seldom done and in this way is 
comparable to another of Shaws works. Man and Superman now 
playing in New York. Both are 
satiric comedies presenting the 
battle of the -sexes but from dif
ferent viewpoints. Tickets for the 
production, which opens on Jan
uary 30 for a weeks run will be 
available in Mr. McKelways office about January 26.

of the heavy snows and cold 
weather throughout the country, 
and the casualty list has hit the 
Plaid staff this week. Our editor 
Cecille Zellner has had to take 
it in strides with the others and 
didnt appear at the office this 
evening. A Virus X victim, I 
presume!After a thorough explanation of 
a difficult question in A. C. Cir
cuits, Sullivan was satisfied that 
the instructor did his bit, but he 
still didnt understand the solu
tion. Neither did anyone else!
Joe Danko, Frank Stavish and 
Jim Doherty think that Pittsburgh 
will never be the same since they 
had a party on one of the re

seen any drastic changes made?

ing if the occasion warrants it, 
and last Friday night was the oc
casion. Round Her Head She 
Wore a Red Ribbon.

Miss C. Romanoff, who is in 
charge of the Plaid banquet, re
ported on preparations which are 
being made, but Was not able to 
name a definite date. This closed 
the old business and brought up 
new business.
It was decided that a party will 
be held for the evening students at 
a time and place to be decided by 
the social chairman. There will be 
no charge and the purpose is to 
promote friendship among Even
ing School students. Plans were 
made to hold an Easter Program

Letter to the Editor
Banquet Defended
Editor, the Tartan
The purpose of this letter is to 
give facts concerning a recent pe
tition submitted to Student Coun
cil concerning the annual Student 
Council banquet and to clear up 
any misconceptions and misinfor
mation that the student body 
might have on the subject.
At the last Council meeting a 
petition signed by 190 students 
was presented. That petition re
quested that any social function 
of Student Council be approved 
by a majority of the students in 
an all-school vote. At the time this 
was received, there were plans for 
a Council banquet to be held Jan
uary 16, 1948, which had been ap
proved last October 23, and mo
tion of which appeared in the 
Tartan. The constitution of Stu
dent Council states that any pe
tition of referendum about a 
Council decision must be submit
ted within two weeks of notifica
tion. Since the petition submitted 
on January 14 did not meet this 
qualification it was disallowed as 
a request for referendum by vote 
of Council.
Since the question has been 
raised about the subject of a Stu
dent Council banquet we would 
like to present some facts for the 
general information of these in
terested. The Student Council 
banquet is not a new or isolated 
occurrence, for Student Council 
has held annual banquets in the 
past, and many other organiza
tions which receive funds from 
the Council for their operation, 
hold annual banquets as a recog
nition of service to the organiza
tion and to the school fund.
The funds for this banquet were 
allocated in the regular manner, 
and their allocation did not de
prive the other organizations of 
ample funds for their operation.
We hope that these statements 
have cleared up any question that 
may have arisen concerning the 
petition submitted to Student 
Council at its meeting on Janu
ary 14.
Your truly,
George W. Marshall, Pres.
Rosemarie Knott, Secy.
