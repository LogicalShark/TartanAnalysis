Post office overcomes midday emergency
Veronique Lee/Photo Staff
Only a handful of packages were affected by the post office flooding last 
Tuesday, as postal services employees quickly arrived to prevent further damage.
by Bary Dunn
News Editor
Postal Services employees were 
forced to evacuate the post office on 
the University Centers lower level 
last Tuesday when a fire alarm 
sounded throughout the building. As 
per standard procedure, the building 
was emptied. However, this was not 
a normal fire alarm. The alarm per
sisted and klaxons intermittently 
came back.
Later in the day, security person
nel were dispatched throughout the 
building to inform UC denizens of 
the temporary lack of a fire detection 
system.
We didnt have a clue what was 
going on, said Theresa Mele, man
ager of Postal Services.
The emergency evacuation 
occurred as a result of a racquetball 
in the University Centers court 1 hit
ting a ceiling sprinkler. According to 
UC info desk manager Judy 
Ghogomu, the sprinkler trigger had 
a much greater effect than it should 
have had.
It somehow triggered the whole 
alarm system, she said. After fire 
inspectors confirmed that there was 
no fire, people returned to the build
ing, only to hear the alarm go off 
again.
All of the sprinkler water got 
routed to that one sprinkler, said 
Ghogomu. They kept turning it off, 
but the sprinkler kept irritating the 
alarm system.
After being exiled from thei-rworkplace, postal employees 
returned at 1:15 pm, approximately 
fifteen minutes after the alarms first 
sounding, only to find water leaking 
through the ceiling of the Post 
Offices back room, where package 
pick-up typically occurs.
According to Mele, the sprinkler 
system had not gone off, but 
nonetheless, water still seemed to 
leak through the papier-mache-like 
ceiling, pouring out in some loca
tions more heavily than others, such 
as alongside the pipes.
Though small recycling bins 
helped to remedy the flow initially, 
Central Property Services soon 
arrived at the scene to permanently 
bring an end to the leaking water. 
Shortly thereafter, the
Environmental Health and Safety 
group arrived as well, only to inform 
Mele and her staff that the ceiling 
insulation had been damaged.
Out of the abundance of packages 
being stored in the back room, only 
five or six were struck by water, Mele 
said.
We moved the packages really 
fast and got them to a dry place, she 
added.
About four of the wet packages 
recipients came to examine their 
belongings, Mele said; none of the 
packages contents were damaged 
whatsoever. Mele promised, howev
er, that any items damaged would be 
replaced.
By the end of the day, the ceiling 
bore exposed blotches of yellow scat
tered across it. A collapsed desk was 
the only other damage the post 
office experienced.
All mail and package envelopes 
are kept near the front of the post 
office; thus, no such mailing items 
were ruined.
Everythings up and running, 
said Mele. We opened at 10 am 
[Wednesday] working and we were 
ready to go. This shouldnt happen 
again.
You can always improve on what 
youre doing, Mele added. The 
packages are now on shelves, off the 
ground.
Ghogamu said that as of Tuesday 
evening, all of the sprinklers were 
silenced and the fire alarm system 
was fully operational once again. 
FMS was dispatched to repair the 
sprinkler.

Binstock 
let go from 
VP position
Recent firing of CMU alumnus 
not linked to student illnesses
by Jenny Kim
Junior Staffwriter
Last week, Dining Services dis
missed Carnegie Mellon University 
alumnus Neal Binstock. His official 
title was Assistant Vice President for 
Enrollment. Administration officials 
refused to answer any questions relat
ed to the event. When asked about 
the reasons Binstock was fired, Mike 
Murphys office replied, No com
ment.
Two dining services employees at 
the East Street Deli who worked for 
Neal did not know about his removal 
from office.
One employee said, All I know is 
that Neal was a nice guy. I didnt real
ly get to know him much because Im 
a shy person.
To fill the vacancy at his former 
position, Dining Services has 
appointed Jane Fahringer, who 
directs the Universitys dining opera
tions. William Elliott, vice president 
of enrollment, stated that Fahringer 
will now report directly to him.
Other employees who didnt want 
their names published described him 
as a stern individual.
One of them said, We werent told 
about this situation. They men
tioned that Binstock worked for fif
teen to twenty years as their director. 
They also added that he was a fair 
guy and that he worked really hard.
University President Jared Cohon 
said Binstock was no longer at the 
University and that the University 
does not comment on personal mat
ters. However, Student Senate is 
waiting for more information. They 
were left with no details as to what 
occurred. The sudden departure left 
things unorganized, senate chair Vito 
Fiore claims:
We are in the same position as 
others because we also dont know 
what happened. All we hear is that he 
disappeared. Hopefully well be hear
ing more about this next week. He 
added that there were a lot of issues 
to deal with, such as the attempt to 
reform the financial situations and to 
discuss the issue of casual spending. 
He also added, Ive heard many 
rumors but nothing is official yet. 
Were just waiting for an official 
response because weve been left in 
the dark this past week.
attracts
members
by Lucas Yiannatji
Personnel Manager
Student Senate filled vacancies in 
its ranks this past week when it 
admitted eight new members to its 
roster. The positions will not be per
manent, only lasting until the end of 
the semester.
The need for temporary represen
tatives arises when student senators 
leave for a semester abroad, gradu
ate, or schedule classes that conflict 
with Student Senate.
Senate Chair Vito Fiore, a fifth-year 
senior in social and decision science, 
explained the selection process.
We publicize and set a deadline a 
few weeks before we decide we want 
to fill a position, said Fiore. Once 
that happens  thats on a Tuesday 
 we validate the petitions... Once 
theyre validated, we contact the stu
dents and say, Please come to the 
meeting this week, because were fill
ing vacancies. [The meeting] is on a 
Thursday, which was last Thursday. 
At that meeting, the candidates 
were brought in one at a time and 
each was given a chance to discuss 
their qualifications and their desire 
for the position. Afterwards, they 
answered questions from members of 
the senate. After fielding the ques
tions of the Senate, the candidates 
were led out of the room while the 
senators discussed and voted upon 
their choices.
Filling vacancies is an internal 
Senate procedure, said Fiore, save 
that you at least 
have to get sig
natures from 
students in your 
college. Thats 
just to fill a seat 
until the term is 
up. Then we 
have the open
elections where KarennH oreHf 
everyone votes
for the main term, which is in April. 
According to Fiore, the number and 
overall qualifications of candidates 
were better than expected.
Overall, 19 candidates vied for 12 
positions. In H&SS, eight students 
competed for two vacant positions. 
Seats from MCS, CIT, SIA, and SCS 
were all filled as well. CFA, however, 
was left with four open spots, with 
one of the five previously unoccupied 
seats being taken by Maureen Burns, 
who ran uncontested.
I was kind of disappointed, Burns 
said. There could have been a better 
turnout. I dont understand why CFA 
has always been underrepresented, 
but I definitely think its something 
that needs to be changed.
In order to have a productive and 
efficient Senate, there has to be that 
equal representation of the students 
on campus, and right now, I dont 
believe that we have that, she added. 
I hope, maybe, that I can help 
change that right now.

Students eying Danforthfor gym addition
of food poisoning
by Lucas Yiannatji
Personnel Manager
Over the past two weeks, outbreaks 
of gastroenteritis were reported across 
campus as numerous students experi
enced vomiting, diarrhea, and severe 
dehydration. Thirty-five cases were 
serious enough to merit trips to the 
emergency room, and in many cases, 
those students missed several days of 
classes. The cases even attracted atten
tion from outside the University, as 
WPXI-11 reported on it. An investiga
tion has been underway by University 
Health Services as well as by the 
Allegheny County Health Department 
(ACHD), with samples sent for analy
sis to the State Health Department. For 
students on campus, the worst seems 
to have passed, as dean of student 
affairs Michael Murphy stated in an email on Friday.
Many had assumed that the cause of 
the illness was food-related.
They [ACHD] have not found any 
linking factor in the reported illnesses, 
either by location of residence, aca
demic building, food source, or any 
other variable. They have received lab 
results that have precluded any man
ner of bacterial infection, stated 
Murphy in the message.

Graduate students Jeremy Shaffer and Matt Cronin are proposing to add the UCs Danforth Lounge to the athetlic facilities.
by James Tetlow
Staffwriter
In the original designs for the 
University Center, Danforth Lounge, 
located at the end of the second 
floor facing Gesling Stadium, was 
intended to be part of the recre
ational facilities. It was later imple
mented as a generic lounge, but 
graduate students Jeremy Shaffer 
and Matt Cronin are currently spear
heading an idea to convert the 
Danforth Lounge into an additional 
exercise room because the current 
fitness areas in the UC are over
crowded during peak times.
According to Shaffer, former GSIA 
vice president for campus affairs, 
the major problem the idea faces is 
the lack of funding available for 
such a project.
The university knows that the 
weight and fitness areas are a prob
lem, Shaffer said. The basic issue
is that exercise [and] fitness [are] at 
the bottom of University priorities. 
Recently, we built those new 
chemistry buildings. Should we 
have diverted attention from chem
istry to athletics? Well, if youre not 
taking chemistry, maybe your 
answer is yes, said Vice President of 
Enrollment William Elliott. You 
have to make some hard choices 
when it comes to spending.... You 
have to take concern for primary 
objectives while considering other 
important things.
Elliott added that most students 
are more interested in an education 
that will prepare them for a career 
than t'hey are in athletics.
This is not to say that our critical 
needs dont include athletics, but we 
havent gotten around to it yet, 
Elliott said.
Converting the Danforth Lounge 
would be less expensive than buildSee DANFORTH, page A4
times after midnight.
They didnt seem to know what it 
was, other than some stomach thing... 
They still dont know what it is, said 
Wright.
Ann Shchelokova, a sophomore in 
chemical engineering and environ
mental engineering and an RA in 
Morewood E-Tower, had three resi
dents become sick on Thursday, 
January 29; two had to go to the hos
pital. At the hospital, as most places on 
campus, the assumption was food poi
soning.
They all got diagnosed with food 
poisoning. The doctor told us that they 
might get diarrhea, so he gave them 
medicine... I asked, Are you sure? 
and he said, Yeah, theyve got food 
poisoning. 
The Allegheny County Health 
Department, by studying blood and 
stool samples from the patients, has 
ruled out the possibility of bacterias 
being the cause of illness; however, 
according to David Zazac, public infor
mation assistant for the ACHD, a virus 
continues to be a possiblity, but the 
truth will not be entirely determined 
for seven to 10 days.
We have sent six samples on to the 
State Health Department for further 
analysis, more sophisticated analyses 
that we cant do here, said Zazac.
Zazac did state, however, that there 
had been no determination yet as to

Tray Sledding, 2/04/04, 6:46
pro  Carnegie Mellon EMS 
responded to a medical call from a 
person at the Cut near the tennis 
courts. A student had been sledding 
down the hill near the tennis courts 
on a cafeteria tray. When he started 
down the hill, he lost balance when 
the tray slipped over a patch of ice.
He fell off of his tray and scraped 
three fingers on his right hand. EMS 
treated the injury and offered trans
port to a medical facility. The stu
dent declined, saying he would go 
to Health Services in the morning if 
he needed further attention.
Later that night, Campus Police 
received a call from the same stu
dent, stating that his finger was still 
bleeding. He requested to go to a 
hospital.
Boot Straps, 2/03/04, 6:57
pm  A police officer was dis
patched to room 305 of the Purnell 
Center for a medical call. A student
said she was trying on a pair of high 
boots for a costume fitting. After 
she put on the boots, she claimed 
that they were too tight, and the 
circulation on her right foot was 
impaired.
She told the officer that her right 
foot has to be cut off, because the 
boot was on too tight. EMS applied 
an ice pack to her foot after remov
ing the boot from her foot.
There was some redness present, 
but the student declined transport 
to a medical facility.
Missing Laundry, 2/03/04, 
5:07 am  A student called 
Campus Police to report that his 
clothes had been stolen from the 
Mudge House B-Tower laundry 
room. He said that, at 4:10 am, he 
had placed two loads of laundry 
into the washing machine and had 
left the area. Then, at 4:45 am, he 
returned to the laundry room to 
place his clothes in the dryer.
At this time, he discovered that 
the digital reading on the washing 
machine read 18 minutes remain
ing. When he opened the machines, 
all of his clothes were missing. 
None of the other six machines had 
his clothes.
He gave an estimate total of $350 
for the value of clothes that were 
stolen from the machines. They
were mostly underwear, socks, and 
towels.
Drugs and Alcohol, 1/31/04, 
2:13 am  Campus Police received 
a call reporting an intoxicated 
female student who was found 
lying unconscious on the floor. She 
was located in the mens room of 
the main hallway of West Wing.
When the police arrived, 
Carnegie Mellon EMS was already 
attending to an intoxicated female. 
When she regained consciousness, 
she started to answer questions that 
were not asked, and became very 
talkative. She was also nervous and 
agitated, exhibiting redness around 
her eye sockets and saliva building 
up in her mouth.
A campus EMT said that she was 
currently under the influence of a 
substance in addition to the alco
hol. The mens room was clear of 
any possible evidence that could 
confirm the females condition.
On a check of the ladies room, 
an officer found a females scarf on 
the counter, and a clear plastic zip 
lock bag with a white powdery sub
stance next to the scarf. This sub
stance tested positive later for 
codeine or morphine, but. it could 
not be proven that it belonged to 
the intoxicated female.
When the city medics arrived to
transport her to the hospital, she 
began to argue and struggle with 
the medical personnel. She was 
told she could either go to the hos
pital or be placed under arrest for 
disorderly conduct and taken to 
Allegheny County Jail. The female 
chose to go to the hospital.
Suspicious Person, 2/01/04, 
4:34 pm  A report was filed by a 
Carnegie Mellon student for a sus
picious person that had been fol
lowing her. She was walking from 
the University Center to Margaret 
Morrison Carnegie Hall when she 
noticed a white male, & tall, 200 
pounds, wearing a black puffy coat. 
He was standing behind the pillars 
at the University Center when she 
first saw him. As she walked 
towards Margaret Morrison, she 
could hear someone else walking 
behind hen
When she turned around, the 
male ran back behind the pillars. 
The. students roommate also 
reported that she saw a white male 
in dark clothing standing by the 
steps near Margaret Morrison 
Apartments the day before. She 
noted that he had been standing 
there for a long period of time, with 
no apparent destination. The two 
females were told that the police 
would conduct a foot patrol of that
area from 11 pm to 7 am.
Sprinkler Activation, 2/03/04, 
1:08 pm  The sprinkler head in a 
University Center racquetball court 
was activated after a player had hit 
it with a ball. Water was flowing 
down onto the floor of the court by 
the time Central Property Services 
arrived. The water also seeped 
through the floor boards to the post 
office that is located below the 
court. After the clean up, postal 
services reported that only one 
book was damaged by the water.

Student fights for 
I $20K lotto ticket
! AMHERST, Mass (U-WIRE)  In a 
legal dispute that has received 
national attention, Erika R. Schmitt, a 
University of Masssachusetts student 
is alleging that a Westboro conve
nience store clerk stole a $20,000 
winning scratch ticket from her.
According to the 18-year-old fresh
man, on January 19 she was outside 
the Milk Street Getty Mart in her 
hometown with several friends who 
had already purchased lottery tickets 
when the clerk, who Schmitt knew as 
Tony motioned for her to enter the 
store.
Once inside, Schmitt bought a 
Lucky Star ticket and proceeded to 
scratch it in front of the store clerk, 
Antoine Reiche, 34, of Westboro. It 
was then that^ Schmitt realized that 
she had won a prize of $20,000.
According to Schmitt, when she 
went to show the clerk, Reiche seized 
the ticket out of her hands and told 
her that the ticket was worth only 
$100. When Schmitt demanded to 
see the ticket, the clerk told her to 
take the money and leave the store, 
claiming he had already entered it
into the lottery register.
Schmitt called the Westboro 
police, who were unable to get the 
clerk to hand over the ticket. The 
clerk claimed that the ticket had 
been thrown away. Police have since 
charged Reiche of the Getty Mart in 
connection with the incident.
According to - the Worcester 
Telegram & Gazette, Reiche was 
arraigned in Westboro District 
Court on Feburary 2 on a charge of 
larceny of more than $250, a felony 
in the state of Massachusetts. 
Reiches hearing had been post
poned because he required a French 
interpreter. Regarding the media 
attention that the case has received, 
Ms. Schmitt said, I didnt think it 
was gonna get this big at all.
Following Reiches initial hearing 
in January, Schmitt agreed to speak 
with WBZ, Channel 4 in Boston. 
Several local television news crews 
soon besieged her aunts house.
Schmitt said that the story has 
been reported in newspapers as far 
away as South Carolina and Los 
Angeles. She has also been inter
viewed by several radio stations, 
including one in Seattle. All of this 
attention culminated with two sepa
rate appearances on CNN live. She 
has also found herself recognized 
locally and around the state by peo
ple who have seen her on TV.
The state Lottery Commission has 
determined that a book of Lucky
Star tickets containing, a $20,000 
winner was at the Getty Mart. 
According to The Boston Globe, the 
lottery commission has suspended 
the lottery license of the store pend
ing an investigation. The commis
sion has informed Schmitt that, 
assuming someone else does not 
return the ticket, in one year she 
will be awarded the $20,000 that 
the ticket was worth.
Erika says that when and if she 
gets the money she will Use some of 
it to buy herself a used car, put 
$5,000 into savings and use the rest 
of the money to help her aunt pay 
the fees and loans associated with 
attending UMass.
USC to host 
democratic debate
LOS ANGELES (U-WIRE)  USC 
will host a Democratic presidential 
candidates debate organized by the 
Los Angeles Times and CNN on 
Thursday, February 26, school offi
cials said.
CNN will broadcast the event live 
from Bovard Auditorium at 6 pm 
PST.
Most students will not be able to 
attend the event because of limited 
seating. There will, however, be 
viewing areas for students to watch 
the event live on CNN, said Susan 
Heitman, vice president of USC pub
lic relations.
CNN will take up the entire first 
balcony and some of the lower level 
for cameras and lighting equip
ment. The second balcony will be 
closed for security purposes leaving 
approximately 300 seats, Heitman 
said.
Staff and family members from 
the candidates campaigns will get 
priority for seats.
Whatever seats remain will be 
split between the Times, CNN and 
USC guests.
What were doing with the seats 
we do have in Bovard is working 
with faculty members who are 
teaching classes directly related to 
electoral politics, Heitman said.
Larry King will moderate the 
debate, said David Garcia of the 
Times. Panelists have not been 
announced. rv.
After Tuesdays spree of primaries 
and caucuses, the remaining candi
dates are Senator John Kerry and 
John Edwards, Rep. Dennis 
Kucinich, Gen. Wesley Clark, Rev. Al 
Sharpton, and former Gov. Howard 
Dean.
However, there are more than 10 
state contests before Feburary 26 
allowing for the possibility that one 
or more candidates may drop from 
the race before the USC debate.
The college is planning on five 
candidates for the debate, Heitman 
said.
After the 90-minute debate, the 
candidates and press corps will 
adjourn to the Annenberg East 
Lobby for interviews. Only recog
nized members of the press will be 
allowed into the building, said 
Geoffrey Baum, director of public 
affairs at Annenberg School for 
Communications.
Baum said he expects representa
tives from every major print and 
broadcast news source to be pre
sent.
Members of the press corps will 
watch the debate, make phone calls 
and write their stories from a 
makeshift press room in the 
Physical Education buildings south 
gym.
Associates Park, between Bovard 
and the Physical Education build
ing, will hold the candidates cam
paign trailers.
There will be a rich schedule of 
events that will culminate in the 90 
minutes of actual debate, Baum 
said.
Political humorist Bill Maher will 
speak at Bovard on Tuesday before 
the debate, and CNNs daily news 
show Inside Politics may broadcast 
from USC on Wednesday and 
Thursday, Baum said.
The Annenberg School is working 
with the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of 
Politics to plan other events around 
campus before and during the 
debate, Baum said.

I  l 1; Infant dies after 
I second head removedI
; SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic 
i (AP)  An infant girl born with a second 
| head bled to death Saturday after complex 
| surgery to remove her partially formed twin,
 her parents and doctors said.
I A medical team completed the 11-hour
 Operation Friday night and said 8-week-old
 Rebeca Martinez died seven hours later.
I Doctors had warned after the surgery that 
\ the girl would be at great risk of infection or
 hemorrhaging.
! We knew this was a very risky surgery,
| and now we accept what God has decided,
1 Rebecas father, 29-year-old Franklin 
! Martinez, said at a news conference with his 
| wife. Rebeca is no longer with us physically,
1 but no one will forget her. 
i Martinez said the family would bury 
\ Rebeca in a private funeral later in the day.
; The girl lost a lot of blood in the operation,
i which apparently caused her to suffer a heart 
! attack, said Dr. Jorge Lazareff, the lead sur| geon. Friends and family donated almost four 
i gallons of blood for surgeons to use during 
! Rebecas operation.
This was not a failure or an error,
 Lazareff said. When we left here last night at 
! midnight the girl was in stable condition. At 
I some point in the middle of the night, she
started to bleed.
! Rebeca was born December 10 with the 
; undeveloped head of her twin, an extremely
 rare condition known as craniopagus para! siticus.
Fully developed twins born conjoined at 
the head are extremely rare, accounting for 
one of every 2.5 million births, but parasitic 
twins, where one twin stops developing in the 
womb, are even rarer. Rebecca was the 
eighth documented case in the world of cran! iopagus parasiticus, doctors said.
All the other infants documented to have 
had the condition died before birth, making 
! Rebecas surgery the first known operation of 
its kind.
Without an operation, Rebeca would have 
! barely been able to lift her head at three 
j months old. Her doctors said the pressure
from the second head, attached on top of the 
first and facing up, would have prevented her 
brain from developing.
She was too little to withstand the 
surgery, said her mother, 26-year-old Maria 
Gisela Hiciano. She said doctors told her 
Rebeca died about 6 am.
Brazil fines American 
for middle finger
SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP)  A second 
American paid a hefty fine for making an 
obscene gesture during fingerprinting proce
dures for U.S. citizens in Brazil, police said 
Saturday.
Douglas A. Skolnick will be allowed to 
leave the southeastern resort town of Foz do 
Iguacu with his tour group Sunday after pay
ing $17,200 for raising his middle finger 
when he was fingerprinted and pho
tographed, said federal police spokesman 
Marcos Koren.
The customs requirements were imposed 
in response to similar U.S. rules for citizens of 
Brazil and many other countries. The United 
States says its rules will help prevent terror
ists from entering the country.
Skolnick, who arrived in Brazil on Friday, 
was taken before a judge early Saturday after 
being arrested and jailed for hours on the 
charge of showing contempt to authorities.
Skolnick, 55, of New Jersey, said he made 
the gesture as a joke, agreed to pay the fine 
and told the judge he was sorry, Koren said. 
Skolnicks hometown was not immediately 
known.
U.S. consular officials in Brazil were aware 
of the incident but were not asked to provide 
any assistance, said Wesley Carrington, 
spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Brasilia.
Globo TV aired footage Saturday showing 
Skolnick entering a jail cell and telling 
Brazilian journalists, Im an American citi
zen. Im not a monkey.
After the court hearing, Skolnick was taken 
to the hotel where the tour group was stay
ing. He was kept inside his room with a police 
standing guard outside while the group 
toured the area, famed for its waterfalls, 
Koren said.
After paying the fine, Skolnick was free to 
enjoy the little time he has left here, Koren 
said. He said money from the fine will be 
donated to two Brazilian charities for the 
elderly and children.

for more than one murder. But some of the 
states counties have condemned many more 
inmates than others of similar size, according 
to an Associated Press review of Corrections 
Department data.
The disparities between some counties are 
so pronounced that legal experts say capital 
punishment is being unfairly applied in 
California.
The reasons are complex  for one, crimes 
happen more frequently in some places than 
others. But prosecutorial zeal and the atti
tudes of jurors also are factors. The bottom 
line, according to the data, is that the death 
penalty sometimes depends on where the 
crime was committed.
Capital punishment should not depend on 
an accident of geography, said defense attor
ney Robert Sanger, who prepared a lengthy 
analysis of Californias death penalty system 
in the current issue of Santa Clara Law 
Review.
Similar geographical disparities are appar
ent nationwide, and not just at the county 
level. Texas, for example, has executed 317 
people since the U.S. Supreme Court allowed 
executions to resume in 1976, while California 
has put just 10 to death.
The death penalty is getting renewed scruti
ny in California, where Tuesdays scheduled 
lethal injection of Kevin Cooper, who was sen
tenced for hacking four people to death, will 
be the states first execution in two years.
Prosecutors arent likely to push for a capital 
trial to be moved to San Francisco, where the 
newly elected District Attorney Kamala Harris 
declared last month that she will never 
charge the death penalty. Her speech was 
partly an acknowledgment that jurors are 
unlikely to vote for death in the states most 
liberal county.
San Diego, where Coopers trial was moved 
in 1983, is generally conservative and has a 
heavy military presence, but it also delivered 
the lowest per capita number of death sen
tences, 32 in the past year. If the death penal
ty were applied evenly, it would be 57.
Sanger said he believes a statewide commit
tee of prosecutors should review capital cases 
to ensure uniform standards, and the gover
nor should commute any death sentences 
obtained without the committees approval.
Lance Lindsay, executive director of Death 
Penalty Focus in San Francisco, which lobbies 
against capital punishment, said statistics sup
port what he already believes: Anybody with 
a little common sense knows that local politics
Kerry takes lead in 
Washington caucuses
on the ground drives the death penalty.
WASHINGTON (AP)  Sen. John Kerry 
(D-Mass) seized a commanding lead in 
Washington caucuses on Saturday, looking to 
lengthen his lead in the race for the 
Democratic presidential nomination.
Eager to show strength in all regions of the 
country, Kerry also reached for victory in cau
cuses in Michigan and campaigned through 
Southern battleground states during the day.
John Edwards and Wesley Clark held out 
minimal hope for the days contests, aiming 
instead for states still ahead on the campaign 
calendar.
So, too, Howard Dean, who struggled to 
prevent the devastating defection of a power
ful union that gave his candidacy an early 
boost.
Kerry paid scant attention to his Democratic 
rivals, focusing on the Republican in the 
White House.
This week George Bush and the Republican 
smear machine have trotted out the same old 
tired lines of attack that theyve used before to 
divide this nation and to evade the real issues 
before us, the Massachusetts senator said in 
remarks prepared for a Democratic Party din
ner in Richmond, Va.
Theyre extreme, were mainstream, and 
were going to stand up and fight back, he 
said. Aides said Kerrys speech was designed 
to reassure the party he would fight far harder 
than Michael Dukakis, the former 
Massachusetts governor who led the party to 
defeat, in 1988.
Returns from a third of Washingtons 
precincts showed Kerry with 50 percent of the 
vote to 29 percent for Dean. The other candi
dates were in single digits.

Woman lies about 
gang rape incident
PITTSBURGH (AP)  A woman who 
was arraigned Friday on charges that 
she falsely accused several St. Johns 
basketball players of rape told police 
she had agreed to have sex with the 
men for $1000, according to an arrest 
affidavit.
After having sex, the players refused 
to pay her so she called police and told 
the police she was raped.
Sherri Ann Urbanek-Bach, 38, of 
New York, was arraigned on charges of 
prostitution, attempted extortion and 
filing fictitious reports. Urbanek-Bach, 
who did not have an attorney at the 
brief hearing, was freed Friday after 
posting $20,000 bond.
Urbanek-Bach met the players at a 
strip club hours after the team lost a 
game against Pittsburgh on Wednesday 
night, and then went back to a hotel, 
police said.
Doubts about Urbanek-Bachs story 
were raised after one of the players gave 
investigators his cell phone, which he 
had used to videotape some of the 
encounter, police said.
While no criminal charges were filed 
against the players, St. Johns disci
plined the men for violation of team 
rules and behavior inconsistent with St. 
Johns mission and values.
Grady Reynolds, a senior, was 
expelled from St Johns, a Roman 
Catholic college; leading scorer Elijah 
Ingram, a sophomore, and senior 
Abraham Keita were permanently sus
pended from the team and both could 
be expelled.
Freshman Lamont Hamilton and 
senior Mohamed Diakite were suspend
ed and freshman Tyler Jones faces disci
pline that has not been determined, 
said school spokesman Dominic 
Scianna.
The players went to the club in 
McKeesport after St. Johns lost to No. 4 
Pittsburgh 71-51. Urbanek-Bach told 
police she met the players at 2:30 am at 
the strip club.
The players were not made available 
for comment by the school.
Girl suspended for 
saying hell
PITTSBURGH (AP)  A second-grad
er was suspended for a day for telling a 
classmate he would go to hell for say
ing, I swear to God.
Brandy McKenith, 7, was suspended 
for swearing for saying the word hell, 
but her family says she was referring to 
the biblical location of fire and brim
stone.
She served the suspension Tuesday. 
The Pittsburgh Public Schools student 
code of conduct prohibits profanity, but 
doesnt provide a definition, spokes
woman Pat Crawford said. The school 
would not comment further.
Brandys father, Wayne McKenith, 
said when he learned about the suspen
sion, he thought perhaps his daughter 
had said something worse, so he called 
the teacher for details. He was told 
another student overheard his daughter 
say the word.
I said, Hell? She got suspended for 
that?  McKenith said.
He said he asked the school to evalu
ate its profanity policy.
Hell is like the least of the words in 
school today, McKenith said. You go 
home and turn on the TV tonight and 
tell me how many times you hear the 
word hell. And I mean network TV, not 
even cable.
Without a clear definition, the dis
trict could run into problems enforcing 
the policy, said Witold Walczak, legal 
director of the Greater Pittsburgh chap
ter of the American Civil Liberties 
Union.
The schools policy says no profani
ty and thats not further defined, 
Walczak said. How should this little 
girl know that hell is not allowed?
Its questionable whether hell is 
even a profanity, and it certainly isnt in 
the way that she used it, he added.
McKenith, a suburban Pittsburgh 
police detective, said family members 
arent religious fanatics, but theres a 
healthy respect for the Lord, so he 
accepts her daughters explanation.
Shes under the assumption that 
good people go to heaven and ... bad 
people go to hell, he said Wednesday.
Sketch released of 
1950 dead man
PITTSBURGH (AP)  On Feburary 
7th, state police released the drawing of 
a 6'4", 200-pound man with brown hair 
who was between the ages of 30 and 35 
when he was shot in the head sometime 
in the 1950s. The mans body was found 
in October 1958 in a wooded area in 
Bedford, about 85 miles east of 
Pittsburgh.
What we would like to get is to find 
out who this person was and to have 
him returned to his family so he could 
have a proper burial, lead investigator 
trooper Joe Kovel said Friday.
The reconstruction of the mans skull 
and body was prompted by a request 
from the Bedford County sheriffs office 
to bury the remains after they had been 
passed from sheriff to sheriff.
Current sheriff Gordon Diehl enlisted 
a clergyman to perform last rites over 
the remains.
I wasnt particularly fond of having 
the safekeeping of him, Diehl said 
Friday. Its time that he be put to rest.

ILLNESS, from page A1
the source of the virus: We cant rule 
out any sources yet. We have to find a 
cause first and then possibly work our 
way backwards from there.
Previous official e-mails sent out by 
Health Services stated that gastroin
testinal disorders are a common 
occurence at this time of year, but 
that the irregularity lay in the mas
sive number of complaints over such 
a short period of time. When asked if 
this was a common occurence in the 
City of Pittsburgh, Zazac responded 
that it was, saying, Right now [the 
outbreak] is associated with CMU, 
but outbreaks have occurred in the 
past. It comes and goes very quickly 
when large groups of people live or 
work close together.
The fact that, at the present time,
the Carnegie Mellon campus is the 
only area that has been affected by 
the presumed virus, has led to some 
criticism of campus food services and 
the University as a whole. CMU 
needs to take more responsibility for 
[the outbreak], because it doesnt 
seem to be happening anywhere 
else, Wright said.
Its hard to find places on campus 
to eat when youve got something like 
this. The Underground has Jell-Os 
and juices, but theres not much other 
than that, he said.
Others felt that Health Services did 
its job well.
Said Shchelokova, I like that 
[Health Services] sent us the e-mails. 
The last one they sent us said that it 
was a virus; I think they took the 
right steps to research it and work 
with Allegheny Health.
New representatives
fill seats in Senate
SENATE, from page Al
tion into Student Senate. She dis
cussed that despite having only one 
meeting, she felt the regular Senate 
members have been really nice so far.
It seems like everyone gets along 
well, and theyre there to work and 
make the Senate efficient, and that 
will help tremendously in the transi
tion of the new members, Burns 
said.
According to Fiore, the students 
who were not selected as senators 
will still have the opportunity to serve 
as members-at-large. A member-atlarge is a student who has speaking
rights in the Senate, and can also 
serve on any of the six standing 
Senate committees to work on issues, 
but does not have the ability to vote 
or introduce legislation into the 
Senate.
Senator Steven Kling, junior ECE 
major and former business affairs 
committee chair, thought the recent
ly filled positions would have a posi
tive impact on student senate in the 
future.
Its a definite improvement, said 
Kling. The more people you get into 
[Student Senate], the more work you 
get done, the more ideas that come 
out, the more you can do.
 Carnegie Mellon students are often inconvenienced and forced to form lines in order to use one of the six total treadmills on campus.
DANFORTH, from page A1
ing an entirely new area; however, a 
' significant amount of funding is still 
-required  more than the athletic 
department currently has budgeted 
for the UC.
One suggestion made by Cronin, 
former GSIA president for campus 
affairs, is to use the regular reserve 
from the Student Activities fee  
which is rarely tapped  to finance 
the project, and to solicit funding 
from undergraduate and graduate 
students as well as faculty. Cronin 
also said he has a subscription to 
Bally Total Fitness, a local fitness cen
ter, because the equipment in the
Skibo weight room is outdated.
Skibo Gym was recently designat
ed a Pittsburgh historic building, and 
since the dedication weve been told 
funding has been considered to beau
tify it, said Donna Morosky, director 
of fitness and health.
We recently added rubber coating 
to the stairs, and this spring the 
weight room will be getting a new 
floor, said Morosky.
One of Moroskys major goals is to 
maintain and improve the Skibo 
weight room in order to keep the 
equipment up to date and divert 
some of the pressure from the UC 
exercise rooms to Skibo Gym. Again, 
however, funding is a major issue for
any changes being considered by the 
athletic department.
Another major issue for the conver
sion of Danforth Lounge is the loss of 
its current uses as a dining facility, 
study room, and meeting place for 
organizations. Also, the No Parking 
Players improvisational comedy 
troupe performs in the Danforth 
Lounge, and converting the lounge 
into an exercise room would leave 
them without an adequate perform
ance area.
In limited discussions, there 
seems to be considerable support [for 
converting Danforth Lounge into an 
exercise room], but there is also a 
need to address the issues of the
potential loss of Danforth Lounge in 
its current use, said dean of student 
affairs Mike Murphy. The important 
thing is to give an opportunity for all 
members of the community to weigh 
in.
Last year when the space renova
tions in the UC basement were being 
discussed at open town meetings, one 
of the proposals was to create larger 
dance and fitness spaces on the lower 
levels, and to put the Scotland Yard 
recreation area on the second floor. 
The plan was changed after discus
sion in open town meetings, and 
Murphy said he expects meetings 
later this year to open discussion on 
similar ideas and concerns.

I THE TARTAN,9 February 2OO4Intro to biomed engineering book written
vby Lucas Yiannatji
* _Personnel Manager
i C Michael Domach, a professor of
J biomedical engineering (BME) at
Carnegie Mellon, recently wrote an
* ^introductory textbook for first-year
biomedical engineering students.
The textbook fills a gap in the field, 
bringing the world of BME closer to 
the beginner student by providing a 
format that is easier to digest than 
I I the traditional BME textbook, while
J 'introducing more basic concepts for
beginning students. Todd Przybycien, 
head of BME at Carnegie Mellon has 
1 taught Introduction to Biomedical 
'Engineering several times.
[The textbook] occupies a unique 
J place in the market. Theres absolute
ly a need for it; theres nothing [else] 
out there for freshmen and sopho>  mores, said Przybycien.
. Domach talked about his goals for 
; the book and his experiences writing
it. According to him, the process 
began when he was approached by 
' - editors asking for ideas. He told them 
,}>*>* about what he perceived to be a real 
problem in the engineering fields: 
Engineering books were either too
> t* complicated for beginners to use, or 
!>**else students were left with no book,
but only the notes of the professor. 
What Prentice Hall [the books
> * publisher] was looking for was some**thing that could kick off a series of
** * :books that get more and more specific as you go down the line. 
Something that freshmen and sopho< . ^ mores, reading it and using it 
L * ^  through the semester, taking the 
w if.'* '
class, could use to decide at the end 
of the semester if they really want to 
do this or not. Maybe they could find 
some examples or models in there 
that they can then use as the basis to 
plan out what they wanna do while 
theyre in school, said Domach.
Domachs major goals in writing 
this textbook were to expose students 
to a variety of subjects within BME 
and to relate the field to a range of
"Theres absolutely need 
for it, and there's noth
ing [else] out there.... 
 Todd Przybycien
other fields in which the students 
might be interested. But what really 
makes the textbook novel is its inclu
sion of an interactive website.
According to Domach, most of the 
basic information and main points 
are included in the textbook. Then, 
said Domach, theres the stuff that 
works better electronically  some 
simulators, real colorized pictures, 
and links to really high-end, 
research-quality resources, some 
from the federal government. 
Different countries maintain data
bases of proteins, and they have soft
ware that lets you bring the threedimensional structure up. You can 
put pictures like that in a book, but 
why do that? If youre interested in 
one kind of protein, and somebody 
else is interested in something in the 
brain, pick your own and do it.
Domach further commented that 
although he had written symposiumseries books with ofher professors, 
this was his first actual textbook.
I think anybody that puts together 
a textbook will tell you that its timeconsuming, sometines rewarding, 
but by and large iti a grind, said 
Domach.
The major differerce, he said, was 
that the publishing process seemed to 
be one-directional, 4s opposed to a 
collaboration with qther professors,
in which a paper is
forth, eventually becoming better.
Once you send it 
er] electronically its 
totally inaccessible
to [the publishin a form 
the guy who
wrote it in the first place. So, youre
trying to fix somehing, to make
something better, ani if thats gonna
happen, the persoi
ends gotta do his tling, and in the
process of making
sent back and
on the other
things better,
things get worse, sad Domach.
Domach said that there were also 
positive aspects to th i process.
We all know only so much, so to 
put some additional naterial in there 
forces you to go out, "and learn, and 
stretch a little more. 0 at the end of 
the day, you learn soi jething.
Asked about Domajjh and his text
book, Clinton Loo, a jirst-year in the 
class said, I like him; hes really 
charismatic. The took is pretty 
straightforward. Whafiwere studying 
right now is just bio,but [Domach] 
told us from the begpning that we 
were covering different sections, like 
civil engineering and fits connections 
with] biology.... I thought it was easy 
to read and comprehe Jd.

-*Vu Duy Thuc was named the best information technology student in the nation in 
2003. He is graduating early with a degree in SCS.
CS researcher ranked num
ber one in country for 2003
-by Karen Hoffmann
 ** Contributing Editor
**4 The e-mails subject line said 
Congratulations, but Thuc Vu had
* *J"*o read all the way to the end before
t ithe news sunk in: he had been named 
the best male undergraduate in the 
'nation in computing research. 
Wow, he said softly.
Last Thanksgiving break, Vu, a 
senior computer science major, was 
notified that he had received the 
2004 Outstanding Male 
Undergraduate Award from the 
Computing Research Association.
The award, a cash prize of $1000 
sponsored by Mitsubishi Electric 
Research Labs, recognizes that the 
recipient has the potential to do out
standing research in computing. In 
trying to quantify just how presti
gious Vus award was, Mark Stehlik, 
CS assistant dean for undergraduate 
education, just settled on pretty 
damn significant.
Andrew Bortz, a senior in CS and 
mathematics, and Sarah Tyler, a 
senior in CS, both received honorable 
mentions in the competition. In the 
12 years the competition has been 
running, Carnegie Mellon has had a 
first-place winner once before: 
Andrew Ng, CS 97.
Vu has a 4.0 QPA and is graduating 
with his CS degree and a minor in 
mathematics in three years. But it has 
not gone to his head.
Hes very unaffected by the accoT ' " 
lades and by his own abilities, 
Stehlik said. For someone to be that 
good and be that humble is a very 
rarely seen combination.
Tall, wearing rectangular wirerimmed glasses, Vu carries himself 
with a relaxed attitude. He is polite, 
and quietly confident. He likes to play 
soccer and basketball, and he collects 
butterflies and beetles  his collec
tion currently resides in Vietnam. He 
also likes to skydive with the CMU 
Explorers Club, though he wishes he 
could do it more often. Those who 
know him consistently mention how 
nice a person he is.
Vu founded and is co-president of 
the Vietnamese Students Association 
to promote Vietnamese culture.
I think Vietnamese is a wonderful 
culture, he said, smiling, but Im 
biased. He saw a need for it because 
CMUs Vietnamese community is rel
atively small. We wanted to get a 
group together to connect people, he 
said.
In Saigon, Vietnam, Vu studied 
math at his magnet junior high 
school. He was attracted to the sub
ject because he enjoyed solving prob
lems. However, he said, I couldnt 
see its application to real-life situa
tions. So for high school, he chose to 
study computer science instead. He 
left Saigon for Anaheim, California, 
where he completed his high school 
education.

ood poisoning
Vol ume9o88
Health Services nay not be able 
to tell you whether iood poisoning 
is to blame for the recent rash of 
gastrointestinal illn<ps on campus, 
but I can tell you hcjv food poison
ing works. As the pame implies, 
food poisoning is the] result of some 
sort of poison getting in your food.
)f food poisonly bacteria, but 
i>n the lookout 
is, and toxins 
oorganisms.
ir toxic excre3Ut direct conDuh. More than half 
ing cases are caused 
you also have to be 
for viruses, parasit 
released by such mi 
Poor food preparation practices 
are generally the reapon that micro
scopic critters and ti 
ment end up in food, 
tamination can also make a meal 
deadly. For example j staphylococ
cus aureus bacteria are spread by 
sneezing, but arent rilled by cook
ing food, so if you let myone sneeze 
in your dinner, youie out of luck. 
Likewise, if you let ycur cat poop in 
your food, you coulciget toxoplas
mosis, a parasite that; also found in 
undercooked poultry,
Although the Allegheny County 
Health Department has ruled 
out bacteria as the c luse of 
the gastrointestinal ill 
ness that has hit mo 
than 40 members o 
the CMU communi
ty, bacteria are the 
most common 
means by which 
food can make 
you sick.
One wellknown example 
of bacterial food 
poisoning is botu
lism. Botulism is 
particularly dan
gerous and rather 
interesting. Its caused 
by the clostridium bo 
linum bacteria, whicj 
cant survive in the pn 
ence of oxygen. They c| 
also be killed by he 
The risk arises wh 
canned food isnt 
heated properly ^ 
after its
canned. The 
bacteria 
form spores 
that prof
them from oxygen, and when they 
find themselves in the oxygen-free 
environment of canned food, they 
become active, and produce a 
potentially-deadly protein called 
botulin. Being a protein, botulin is 
broken down by heat, so if you cook 
the food after it comes out of the 
can youre fine. But if you should 
can food improperly, and then eat it 
cold, you could ingest botulin. 
Botulin affects the nerve cells that 
are connected directly to your mus
cles, and it disables them, basically 
unplugging your muscles, which 
causes paralysis, and even death. 
You can actually get away with eat
ing the spores though  even 
though they activate in your oxy
gen-free intestines  because you 
have bacteria living in your 
intestines that will kill them before 
they have a chance to produce any 
botulin. Babies, however, havent 
necessarily developed these defens
es, so it can be deadly to feed a baby 
foods that contain botulism spores. 
Honey is a good example of a food 
item that always contains botulism 
spores, which adults dont have to 
worry about. This fact explains why 
you have may have heard 
that its a 
bad idea to 
feed
baby 
honey.
Another popular bacterial food 
poisoning is salmonella. It can be 
present in poultry that was infected 
with the bacteria when it was liv
ing, and in eggs laid by infected 
chickens. If you ingest living salmo
nella bacteria, they can infect you. 
Like most types of food poisoning, 
healthy people will get over it in a 
few days. However, a serious risk 
exists for people with compromised 
immune systems, for example, 
someone undergoing chemothera
py cancer treatment.
This risk exists because getting 
over a salmonella infection depends 
on bacteria in your intestine fight
ing the salmonella bacteria. 
Without those special bacteria, the 
infection can be fatal.
You can avoid contracting salmo
nella from food by cooking it thor
oughly and keeping it frozen or 
refrigerated until its cooked. 
Salmonella can also be contracted 
from contact with bird feces, which 
could presumably also be cooked to 
kill the salmonella bacteria, but Ive 
never tried.
Viral food poisoning most often 
comes from seafood. The principle 
is the same as with salmonella  
you ingest the microorganism and it 
infects you. The only difference is 
that in this case its a virus. 
Examples of such viruses are 
hepatitis A and Norwalk virus. In 
November of 2003, the largest out
break of hepatitis A in U.S. history 
occurred right here in Pittsburgh 
when contaminated green onions 
were served at a Chi-Chis restau
rant without being cooked. (The 
worlds largest outbreak of hepatitis 
A occurred in China in 1988 when 
close to 300,000 people got the dis
ease from eating infected clams.) 
The nice thing about hepatitis A is 
that you can be vaccinated against 
it.
Trichinosis is an example of food 
poisoning caused by a parasite. 
Commonly associated with under
cooked pork, it can also be contractSee POISONING, page A7

New elements 
discovered
In a recent study, scientists 
detected the super-heavy elements 
113 and 115 for the first time. A 
team of researchers from the Joint 
Institute for Nuclear Research in 
Dubna, Russia and the Lawrence 
Livermore National Laboratory 
smashed a target of americium243 atoms with a beam of calcium48 atoms, and detected four atoms 
of element 115 out of billions of 
candidates. After 90 milliseconds, 
each of the nuclei decayed into ele
ment 113. A little over a second 
later, each 115 nucleus first 
decayed into element 111, which 
had first been detected ten years 
ago, and then into dubnium (105).
The two elements are currently 
referred to by their atomic num
bers: ununtrium (113) and ununpentium (115). Once the existence 
of the elements can be indepen
dently confirmed, both elements 
will be renamed. A previous claim 
to the discovery of element 118 
was retracted in 2002 after it could 
not be reproduced.

Super Bowl stunt 
breaks records
TiVo users were as surprised as 
any when Justin Timberlake tore 
Janet Jacksons outfit during the 
Super Bowls MTV half-time show. 
Then they replayed it. Repeatedly. 
According to TiVo, Jacksons stunt 
was the most replayed moment not 
only of the Super Bowl, but of all 
TV moments it has ever measured. 
TiVo measured a 180 percent spike 
in viewership during the incident.
According to Lycos, a popular 
Internet search provider, Jacksons 
stunt was possibly the mostsearched event in the history of the 
Internet. Jackson and other half
time-related searches outscored 
even the largest one-day total for 
terrorist-related searches on and 
after September 11, 2001.
According to Yahoo!, searches 
for Jackson from Sunday to 
Wednesday amounted to 20% of all 
things searched for during those 
three days. The second biggest 
topic searched for in that time 
frame was Super Bowl, at 2.7 per
cent.

Music industry 
goes after KaZaA
Investigators from the Australian 
recording industry were given per
mission by Australian courts to/aid 
12 premises associated with KaZaA 
in Australia. The raided sites 
included the office of KaZaA owner 
Sharman Networks, the homes of 
two of the company's executives, 
three Australian universities, and 
various Internet service providers.
An official statement from 
Sharman Networks claimed the 
search was a knee-jerk reaction 
by the recording industry to dis
credit KaZaA, and that KaZaAs 
legality had already been covered 
by the Dutch supreme court in 
December, which ruled that 
KaZaAs makers cannot be held 
liable for copyright infringement of 
music or movies swapped on its 
software. A U.S. federal lawsuit is 
still pending.

Legislators take 
on game violence
Opponents of violent video 
games are pushing for new legisla
tion in Florida that would penalize 
retailers who rent or sell violent or 
lewd video games to minors.
Critics have been calling for new 
legislation for some time, but 
Rockstar Games Grand Theft Auto: 
Vice City has provided new 
momentum. State representatives 
and activists were disturbed by the 
phrase kill the Haitians in the 
game and by the fact that the 
game gives points for murder.

How food poisoning works
POISONING, from page A6
ed from eating bear, cougar, fox, 
dog, wolf, horse, seal, or walrus that 
isnt thoroughly cooked. The larvae 
of the trichinella worm can be found 
in these meats. If you eat living lar
vae, the acid in your stomach will 
dissolve their protective covering, 
and the exposed worms will make 
their way to your intestine where 
they mature and breed. Symptoms 
of trichinosis include the usual vom
iting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, 
but can also include eye swelling,
muscle pain, and itchy skin. These 
worms are particularly nasty 
because if they dont kill you, the 
fatigue and diarrhea can last for 
months. The nice thing about trichi
nosis is that you cant spread it by 
exposing others to your feces like 
you can with salmonella and hepati
tis A. As much as Id love to tell you 
about tapeworms and campylobacter, I think I should wrap this up, 
because Im getting pretty hungry. 
Just be careful where you eat and 
how you prepare and store your own 
food.
Remember to keep meat and eggs 
chilled before theyre cooked, and 
not to eat food thats come into con
tact with raw meat since its been 
cooked  this includes surfaces on 
which raw meat was prepared. If you 
develop symptoms of gastrointesti
nal illness, it cant hurt to see your 
healthcare provider to ensure its not 
something serious. If someone you 
know shows symptoms of food poi
soning, take my roommates advice 
and Wash your hands, dont make 
out with him, and dont put his feces 
in your mouth!
CMU student awarded top honor
AWARD, from page A6
When he came to Carnegie 
Mellon, he began doing research in 
his first semester  an unusual 
move for a first-year. Stehlik esti
mates that only about six CS majors 
do research their first year.
Then Vu came across a talk on 
robot soccer by Manuela Veloso, a 
professor of computer science, who 
would become his research advisor. 
Velosos research seemed like the 
^perfect fit because of the combina
tion of his love of soccer with his 
research in artificial intelligence. Vu 
approached Veloso in his sophomore 
year. Even though he was a sopho
more, his programming experience 
and attitude singled him out from 
more senior candidates, said 
Veloso.
Rather than work on the robot 
soccer team directly, however, Vu 
worked with one of Velosos post
docs, where he developed a new set 
of techniques to command teams of 
agents like those found in robot soc
cer. Veloso, who nominated Vu for 
the award, called him an excellent 
and dedicated researcher.
Last July, Vu presented his 
research at a conference in 
Melbourne, Australia. Not only was 
it his first time at a conference, 
which was exciting enough, but the 
fact that he was also presenting 
made it quite an experience, said 
Vu. Other research projects Vu has 
worked on include GameBot, a simu
lated environment with little wiz
ards running around, and on the 
SADAR personal assistant project. 
For his senior thesis, Vu is continu
ing his research in multi-agent sys
tems by working on a new platform 
to translate high-level commands 
into different programming lanIntroduction to

guages like C+ + or Java.
He wants to automate the transla
tion process so that a programmer 
can work in an abstract, high-level 
language, and the program will be 
translated into basic code in 
whichever language the program
mer chooses.
Vu plans to attend graduate 
school in computer science, focusing 
on artificial intelligence. He does not 
yet know where he will wind up, but 
he prefers CMU and Stanford.
This semester, his last as a 
Carnegie Mellon undergrad, Vu is 
taking only three classes and work
ing on his senior thesis. Im trying
to take it as easy as possible, he 
said. But taking it easy must mean 
something different for Vu: he and 
Veloso have just written another 
paper, of which he is again the pri
mary author.
Ive advised many students and a 
few were really exceptional... Thuc 
was one of them, said Veloso, point
ing out that Vu maintains a perfect 
QPA despite doing research.
Ever modest, Vu searched for the 
words to describe his feeling that he 
does not deserve all the credit for 
winning the award. I dont think the 
title is as important as what you con
tribute, he said.

TiVo users precious privacy not 
in danger of being destroyed
Big Brother is watching you. Actually, its 
more like Little Brother is watching what 
youre watching on TV. The now-infamous 
halftime show stunt at the Super Bowl has 
produced an unexpected secondary reaction 
from TiVo users concerned about their priva
cy.
Nearly every article or broadcast concern
ing the incident includes statistics released by 
TiVo, Inc., including the ubiquitous most 
viewed moment in TiVo history factoid. 
These gems of information were obtained 
from a random sampling of 20,000 Super 
Bowl viewers who use the digital video 
recorder (DVR). After reading about their own 
viewing habits, users have expressed their 
concern with the matter. TiVo user Sandra 
Munozshe wrote to CNETNews.com expressing 
what is on the minds of some TiVo users: Its 
just sort of creepy.
Some users may also be freaked out by TiVo, 
Inc.s recent deal with Nielsen Media 
Research, the TV rating people. The deal will 
let advertisers know exactly what sitcom jokes 
are replayed and how many commercials are 
skipped, which may change the way sponsors 
deal with television in a radical way. 
However, the deal relates only to people who 
consent to having their more specific viewing 
habits analyzed by Nielsen.
The fact remains that an extremely attrac
tive feature of the DVR, the ability to suggest 
shows to watch based on the users prefer
ences, is tied on the very data that users are 
afraid of having released. Like other techno
logical wonders that bring previously 
unheard-of conveniences and abilities to their 
users, there is a price to pay and a risk to take. 
However, the companies that collect this data 
are fully aware of their consumers concerns, 
and many of them take measures to eliminate 
certain aspects of the data. Some of them turn 
it into aggregate data that cant be traced 
back to individual sources.
TiVo users, the fact that you rewound the 
infamous breast scene 34 times isnt going to 
find its way out to the water cooler at work.
Besides, you agreed to their privacy policy 
when you bought the DVR, saying that it was 
perfectly A-OK. The agreement states that 
TiVo cant get a hold of your private viewing 
information without your consent and even 
goes so far as to offer users to opt out of the 
anonymous data collection just by calling an 
800 number.
Those that argue that most end user license 
agreements (EULAs) are utterly ignored by 
their signers are absolutely correct. This case 
is different for a couple of reasons. In its priva
cy policy, TiVo has made it absolutely clear 
that it want its customers to understand the 
agreement theyre signing, with little or no 
legal language. The documents format is sim
ilar to many EULAs, but its language is plain 
English, readable and understandable by any
one with a high school education. They also go 
a step further, providing a nice short summary 
right at the beginning for everyone too lazy to 
read the whole 10 pages. Reading such a sum
mary is no substitute for reading the whole 
thing, but its especially hard to fathom that 
subscribers would skip the entire thing.
DVR users have little to fear from a compa
ny that understands the concerns of their con
sumers and addresses them in such a straight
forward manner. If only more companies 
would carry out their practices the same way, 
consumers might actually partially base their 
decision on EULAs and give companies second 
thoughts before letting the companies cram 
any draconian version down their throats.
TiVo is innovation in television done right. 
It trims the fat off of a medium that has 
become sexually gratuitous and commercially 
saturated, leaving a leaner and more useful 
television experience. Those who want to 
cling to the couch-potato pastime of channel 
surfing have every right to ignore the DVR, but 
television-loving Americans would be hardpressed to come up with a better answer to the 
glut of reality shows and over-dramatized tal
ent searches. Privacy concerns are certainly 
valid, but in the case of TiVo, the true story is 
nothing more than a revolution in television.
Zimbabwe newspapers fall a 
reminder of our sacred liberties
In a move that outraged free speech advo
cates everywhere, last Friday the Zimbabwean 
supreme court upheld a new law against pub
lishing a newspaper or working as a journalist 
without a government license. Following this 
decision, the last independent newspaper in 
the country, the Daily News, found its contrib
utors forced to stop working under pain of 
imprisonment. This move is the latest of near
ly two years of continued attempts to silence 
the voices of those who disagree with Robert 
Mugabe, the dictatorial  and questionably 
elected  president of Zimbabwe. In the court 
decision, Chief Justice Godfrey Chidyausiku 
ruled that freedom of expression didnt 
include freedom of the press. Rather than risk 
any sort of political opposition, Mugabe has 
found it easier to muzzle those who would 
speak against him.
A truly sad point of this case is the relative 
silence of worldwide newspapers and other 
media about the restrictions that Mugabe has 
put into place on their counterparts in 
Zimbabwe. Of course, the law also restricts 
foreign journalists working in Zimbabwe  
reporters for international news agencies 
must either kowtow to Mugabe or risk losing 
their access to work in the country. The result 
is a world media whose members form a 
group of silent, knowing accomplices to 
Mugabes crimes and sins.
Groups such as Amnesty International (AI) 
have done a great deal to publicize the trials to 
which journalists in Zimbabwe have been sub
jected, and they should be commended for 
their efforts. The groups greatest weakness, 
however, is relying on the supposition that dic
tators care about their public images. Mugabe 
is trying to prove that such concern is unnec
essary by controlling any outlet of dissent for 
people within his country. AI Canada suggests
writing letters about harassed journalists to 
His Excellency, the Honorable Robert 
Mugabe.
Mugabe is responsible for killing thousands 
of his political opponents in the 1980s, creat
ing an inequitable land redistribution pro
gram in the mid-1990s  taking land from 
white farmers and giving it to his cronies 
instead of the black farm workers  and of 
course, enacting stifling press restrictions in 
this new millennium. The United States and 
European Union have both banned his entry to 
their territories for his blatant disregard for 
fair elections. He has trained youth armies  
green bombers  to torture, rape, and kill. 
Robert Mugabe is neither excellent nor honor
able, and any attempt to change his mind with 
honeyed greetings is doomed to failure.
Another ineffective tactic is to complain to 
bureaucracies such as the State Department: 
most of them prefer stability of the region to 
freedom of the people. Change will only come 
from widespread pressure on elected officials 
who rely on the people for their votes. The 
only way to succeed is to communicate these 
evils to people that otherwise might not care 
and convince them to get off their collective 
asses in the fight for human dignity.
Thomas Jefferson once said that he would 
prefer newspapers without a government to a 
government without newspapers. In 
Zimbabwe, there are no daily newspapers left 
that are worthy of the job. Although journal
ists in the United States may complain about 
the constant government roadblocks and red 
tape, it is only too true that there are journal
ists in other parts of the world who would 
gladly fight for those annoyances. As a free
dom-loving people, it is our duty to inform the 
world, or the situation will only change for the 
worse.

Our Prb/acy eez 
Precio usssH
Bum Lee/Art Staff
Editor:
We read the article KGB Slave Auction 
(2/2/2004) with apprehension. Perhaps the 
most insulting thing the authors implied 
was that we must be informed that an event 
exploits and denigrates us as women.
Never while associating with KGB as an 
organization, or as members, have we been 
insulted or exploited. We were asked: 
Would you want your mother or sister on 
the block? Just for fun? We have put our
selves on that block and found nothing 
degrading in the experience.
The piece shocked us with the claim that 
the slaves auctioned were all female and 
dressed in dominatrix costumes with one 
slave performing a striptease. The slave 
observed by the protesters is a CMU gradu
ate. She worked in the Womens Center, par
ticipated in The Vagina Monologues, and 
served as president of KGB. Not all wore 
provocative outfits. One came to the front of 
the room in a pair of jeans and a baggy white 
t-shirt, and garnered bids of over $85 by 
doing headstands. Observing the auction of 
one person does not qualify the protesters to 
state that the event was made up solely of 
women. The male-female ratio of those auc
tioned was 18:14.
The protesters seek to portray an event in 
a presumptuous light, regardless of the 
facts. They came late and missed the read
ing of the rules, which outline how the event 
is to be run and how the auctionees are to be 
treated once purchased:
Section 8: RIGHTS OF THOSE AUC
TIONED. KGB and the purchaser under
stand that the person auctioned waives no 
rights which he or she enjoys under the 
United States or other applicable laws, or 
under the operating guidelines, policies, 
and regulations of Carnegie Mellon 
University.
Section 10: PREROGATIVES OF THOSE 
AUCTIONED. Those auctioned are free to 
refuse any orders which violate their moral, 
academic, financial, contractual, or legal 
obligations. Such refusal does not terminate 
this contract agreement; those auctioned 
are still required to find a mutually accept
able way to perform up to six (6) hours of 
service, as the purchaser may require, 
before the Termination of Service date....
The authors state that: Prior to the event, 
Student Senate was informed of the auction, 
and became angered due to the historical 
connotations ofslave auction.  In fact, five 
members of Student Senate, as individuals, 
not Senators, approached KGB before the 
auction about the name Slave Auction. 
KGB appreciated that the name, which has 
been used for two years, may be in poor 
taste and changed it.
We are also concerned by the way the 
authors seek to parallel slavery to the 
Holocaust. Comparing two atrocities for 
value is just plain wrong.
We find the authors libelous and unsub
stantiated statements offensive. We treasure 
CMUs open-minded diversity. The article 
goes against the very fiber of what we con
sider our community to be. Their final ques
tion, [W]hen student organizations that try 
to bring positive events to campus are strug
gling for funding and recognition, do orga
nizations that engage in inconsiderate, 
insensitive, and inappropriate events need 
to receive recognition? brings to light their 
true political agenda. KGB generates its own 
funding through dues and activities and has 
legitimate recognition. The contribution it 
makes to the CMU community is evident 
throughout the year. Donations to Make a 
Wish Foundation and the MS Walk are just 
two examples of KGBs help in the wider 
community. We believe that had the protest
ers arrived on time and stayed for longer 
than fifteen minutes, they would have been 
fully informed and seen the goodwill of the 
Auction and KGB.

Targeted amendments threaten justice
Kevin Chang
Once again, people are slamming the judi
ciary branch, this time in Massachusetts, for 
doing something unpopular without regard 
to whether the decision is right or wrong. 
The state supreme court recently ruled that 
gay marriage is not illegal, upholding a 
lower courts ruling.
The judicial system of America is not in 
place to set moral guidelines, and setting a 
moral guideline was not the point of the rul
ing. It is in place to enforce the Constitution 
and laws of the United States of America, 
and U.S. law says that separate but equal 
is not equal at all. Similar situations have 
faced the U.S. before. Discriminatory laws 
have been passed against people that were, 
for a long time prior, treated as second-class 
citizens. At the time, the majority of U.S. cit
izens supported that discrimination. 
African-Americans officially suffered under 
separate and unequal conditions for a long
time: 62 years between Plessy v. Ferguson 
and Brown v. Board of Education, but cen
turies unofficially. America needs to learn 
its lesson.
The opinions of select members of the 
Massachusetts community shouldnt have 
more significance just because they are from 
famous people. Politicians such as Senator 
John Kerry and Governor Mitt Romney, both 
of whom disagree with the ruling, are right 
to base their opinions on the public will, 
since their job is to represent the public, but 
the public itself has the wrong opinion.
To counter the court, legislators asked jus
tices if civil unions could be approved in 
place of marriages for gays. Marriage is 
just a word, and there isnt reason to change 
the term to civil union just because a cou
ple is not heterosexual. The legislators, 
while acting in good faith, were only trying 
to get around the ruling and continue to 
deny equal rights to homosexuals.
Wisely, the court set a deadline for the 
state legislature to legalize gay marriage, 
May 17. That day will take longer to arrive 
than most people realize. With the quick 
and efficient legislating system in place in
state governments today, the Massachusetts 
supreme court had to set a date that will 
come in only a few months. Otherwise, end
less stalling and legislative tricks would 
surely take as much time as the court 
allowed, or even drag on indefinitely.
The rationale for giving courts so much 
power in the U.S. system of government 
rests on the fact that legislatures and execu
tives can make poor decisions, even if they 
are simply following the will of the people. 
Some of the most blatant examples of tfyis 
were the existence of Jim Crow laws for so 
many decades in the south and the orders 
that allowed the government to put so many 
Japanese-Americans in internment camps 
during World War II. Eventually, both deci
sions were overturned by the Supreme 
Court, and though both enjoyed significant 
popular support in their time, both are now 
considered wrong without so much as a 
thought.
Opponents of the current ruling love to 
point to the radical 9th Circuit Court of 
Appeals in California, which was most
See COURTS, page A10
Judiciary interference undermines public will
fir Jeff Cullers
Before the month is up, Ohio will become 
the 38th state legislature to slog through the 
legislative process and ban same-sex mar
riage. These state legislatures, who are 
accountable to and elected by the American 
people, have dutifully fulfilled the will of 
their constituents. According to a recent 
CNN/Gallup poll, fully 61 percent of 
Americans do not favor legalizing gay mar
riage; state legislatures are merely carrying 
out their will.
However, the moral values of Americans 
and the good faith actions of state legisla
tures are being thwarted by an activist judi
ciary branch with an agenda. Back in 
November, the Massachusetts supreme 
court declared it unconstitutional to bar 
same-sex couples from the rights and 
responsibilities of marriage. Okay, most 
people could see this coming. However, the 
court went on to order the Massachusetts 
legislature to legalize gay weddings by this 
May 17. The court was undoubtedly aware
that this is a ridiculously short window of six 
months. After having this issue thrust upon 
them, the legislature asked the court if 
Vermont-style civil unions would placate 
their activism. The answer came on 
Wednesday with a ruling that nothing short 
of a marriage between two people of the 
same sex would be satisfactory.
To get a sense of how far-out this ruling is, 
consider that presidential candidate and 
Massachusetts liberal John Kerry, whose 
voting record is even more left than Ted 
Kennedys, does not support gay marriage. 
Consider that one of the judges on 
Massachusettss supreme court is a lesbian 
who dissented in the November ruling 
because she believed the court was flagrant
ly overstepping its bounds. Consider that 
Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney 
immediately denounced Wednesday's ruling 
and vowed to push harder for an amend
ment to Massachusettss constitution ban
ning gay marriage. He said that the amend
ment would be consistent with what I think 
the feelings are of the commonwealth 
about marriage.
So, even in the far left Commonwealth of 
Massachusetts, the governor himself had 
declared that with this decision, their
supreme court is not acting in the best inter
ests of its citizens. He has conceded that a 
constitutional amendment is the only way to 
reign in the court. Nevertheless, by May 17 
the Massachusetts Supreme Court will have 
succeeded in legislating the law over the 
heads of the state congress, the governor, 
and a majority of state citizens. 2006 is the 
soonest a constitutional amendment bring
ing the court back to reality can be voted on, 
so the opinion of a few radical judges will be 
law for some time.
Courts have no business in trying to beat 
lawmakers in a race to define marriage in 
this country. Judges are not elected and not 
accountable to anyone, even courts above 
them. Take, for example, the 9th Circuit 
Court of Appeals in California. This court is 
easily the most clueless and out-of-touch 
court in the country; its most famous ruling 
is declaring the Pledge of Allegiance uncon
stitutional in 2002 and then retracting 
because of the outcry. Of the rulings it 
makes that are appealed to the U.S. 
Supreme Court, fully 75 percent are over
turned. This represents a tiny sliver of all of 
its rulings. Yet the court remains in business,

New BAC limit is no guarantee of road safety
Bary Dunn
1 ; Perhaps Janet Jacksons peep show 
^lst Sunday night left more 
^Pennsylvanians agape and left to 
' invoke an honest opinion on what 
became a nationwide issue than if we 
"Had experienced it under normal 
'"circumstances. By normal circum*J dances I connote the former legal 
T-blood alcohol content (BAC) of .10.
On September 30, 2003, legisla
tion was passed to lower the legal driving limit in Pennsylvania from a .10 
' 'BAC to .08, among other provisions. 
v'Once governor Ed Rendell signed the 
^lgislation, Pennsylvania joined 44 
1 other states with a .08 maximum 
legal BAC, while southern neighbor 
--West Virginia contributed to the 
Handful of remaining states with a .10 
c BAC maximum.
Though this legislation was passed
amidst the autumn season, it did not 
go into effect until February 1  con
veniently timed for Super Bowl 
Sunday. As enticing as that third (for 
women) or fourth drink might have 
been as Adam Vinatieri sent one 
through the uprights in the waning 
seconds  of the game, many 
Pennsylvanians were forced to pass it 
up, fearful of exceeding the new legal 
limit.
Its about time the state govern
ment finally arose from its ignorant 
coma and began to look at the num
bers. About 1000 deaths in 
Pennsylvania during 2001 and 2002 
came as a result of someone driving 
under the influence (DUI). Across 
the nation in 2002 alone, 42,815 peo
ple were killed in crashes that 
involved a driver who had been 
drinking.
In Pennsylvania, males between 
the ages of 21 and 25 led all other 
age/gender groups with 2578 alcohol-related crashes in 2000. While 
non-alcohol-related crashes were dis
tributed evenly throughout the week, 
63 percent of all alcohol-related 
crashes occurred on either Friday, 
Saturday, or Sunday in 2000, the 
majority of which occurred between 
midnight and 4 am.
Though the 24-hour jail time often 
required by first-time DUI offenders 
may sound meager, the penalties for 
repeat reprobates may entail up to 
five years in prison, indefinite dri
vers license suspension, or, what has 
become quite popular, the incorpora
tion of ignition-locking devices into 
ones vehicle. Such devices require 
the vehicles owner to inhale into a 
breathalyzer upon entrance. Should 
the drivers BAC exceed the standard 
limit, he or she will be unable to start 
the vehicle.
So what does this new legislation 
mean for underage college students? 
Actually, the legal limit of a .02 max
imum BAC has not changed. The 
penalties, however, have become 
more severe. Any minor who imbibes 
more than one drink and shortly
thereafter is pulled over in suspicion 
of driving under the influence of 
alcohol may face any such penalty as 
24 hours in prison, a 90-day drivers 
license suspension, or a fine. Its 
rather ironic that there even exists a 
legal limit for minors. After all, if 
underage drinking is, according to 
United States law, illegal, why should 
there exist a tolerance policy for 
driving under the influence?
In all likelihood, this new legisla
tion will not prove to be too effective 
in terms of cleaning up the roads. The 
vast majority of those who drive 
under the influence will continue to 
do so, regardless of a minor decrease 
in the legal BAC level. However, those 
members of the Pennsylvanian drink
ing population who actually stop 
drinking upon reaching their legal 
limit will be able to drive with much 
more coherence than they might 
have in the past, keeping our roads 
safer and, in the long run, saving 
many lives.
There are many others reasons
why some may argue that the dwin
dling legal limit will not actually 
make much of a difference to 
Pennsylvanias drivers. Maybe 
Pennsylvania only lowered the limit 
because it became a common trend 
among other states to decrease the 
legal BAC maximum from .10 to .08. 
More likely, it's due to the threat of 
the federal government to withhold 
federal highway dollars for those 
states that do not switch. The fact of 
the matter is that we will be unable to 
measure the significance of this legis
lation until at least a year has passed, 
at which point the statistics will be 
able to prove whether or not it was all 
worth it. Until then, be careful out 
there on Thanksgiving Eve, New 
Years Day, and Labor Day  the 
three most dangerous nights to be 
driving.

and bacterial origins, but this blow to 
superficial common sense was too 
much for most of the campus to swal
low. After reading the aforemen
tioned news article in The Tartan, 
many people believed that chicken at 
the Schatz dining room was the cul
prit. This inaccurate rumor stems 
from overemphasizing the circum
stances of one students illness.
I wasnt even stating ... that This 
is the source,  clarified Peter Nelson, 
a first-year CIT student. He posted his 
personal experience to misc.market 
and said he was happy to be the sub
ject of a third of the news article. 
He suggested that the Schatz poultry 
was probably what turned his stom
ach afoul. Nelson might have enjoyed 
his 15 minutes of fame, but his eating 
history does not comprise the accu
rate source of the campus-wide prob
lem.
The other Tartan article about gas
troenteritis last week  an editorial 
 especially looked to victimize 
Dining Services for the nausea out
break. The Tartan has a long history 
of antagonizing Dining, a drum to 
beat as one former Tartan editor 
bragged in a Forum article last
semester. The editorial board should 
not have exploited a campus-wide 
epidemic to push its tired, redundant 
campaign against Dining.
The boards editorial conceded 
that Dining could not be factually 
blamed, but deemed that the out
break calls to attention the recent 
rabble-rousing that [Parkhurst, the 
parent company of Dining Services,] 
has been up to. More than half of the 
article ranted against mandatory 
meal plans, food variety, and finan
cial matters.
The Tartan has been too tough on 
Dining over the last year or so. While 
it was reasonable to suspect that food 
caused the nausea outbreak, the gas
troenteritis epidemic should not have 
been a platform to further an irrele
vant and worn agenda against 
Dining.
Campus Police has been largely 
ignored in this whole mess, and as a 
final side-note, Id like to call their 
involvement to attention. Campus 
Police did a fantastic job of driving 
many students to the hospital in 
night hours and undesirable weather. 
Of the students transported to the 
hospital, all seemed greatly pleased 
with Polices promptness and service.
Campus Police is also prepared to 
respond to any need you may have, 
wrote Anita Barkin, director of 
Health Services, in her second e-mail 
alert. Unfortunately, Campus Police 
was rather unprepared, unhelpful, 
and incorrect when I came down 
with the bug. The officer who 
answered the phone did not know 
when Health Services would open, 
and then gave me incorrect times on 
two separate occasions. Campus 
Police should have had this informa
tion, which was already e-mailed to 
the entire campus community, at 
their finger-tips.
I probably shouldnt have deleted 
the e-mail alerts in the first place, 
even if I did not yet feel sick. Campus 
Police was predominantly helpful to 
most people, even if I had a disap
pointing experience. Like Nelsons 
continued distrust of his Schatz meal 
and mine of S Seor, I suppose Im 
just sick-to-my-stomach and angrily 
still trying to find someone to blame.
Michael Croland (mic@) encourages 
you to save official e-mail alerts, even if 
they initially seem insignificant. You 
just might vomit the next morning.
The recent nausea epidemic tested 
the campus communitys ability to 
respond to an emergency Although 
no origin can be identified for the 
outbreak, Health Services and 
Campus Police predominantly passed 
with flying colors. Hopefully, we can 
all learn from our mistakes to make 
next time run even more smoothly.
Health Services acted commendably in confronting the outbreak. 
Two e-mail alerts on Friday, January 
30, informed students, faculty, and 
staff that they should not dismiss 
standard gastrointestinal discomfort. 
Health Services sought to prevent 
dehydration, a common side effect of 
vomiting and diarrhea, and to deter
mine common patterns among the 
cases. Two additional alerts followed 
last week to keep everyone up to 
date.
Health Services worked closely 
with the Allegheny County Health 
Department to politely interrogate 
those who were suffering, about 
everything from recent food history 
to contact with ill peers. Health 
Services even stayed open late on 
Friday night and doubled their 
Saturday hours.
Through all this hard work, it does
nt sit well that no common source 
was found. The two victims of the 
nausea outbreak quoted in The 
Tartans news article last week lived 
across the hall from each other. One 
misc.market poster, who preferred to 
not be identified in this article, noted 
that he and his girlfriend got sick 
within 10 minutes of each other. Its 
quite shocking that despite such bla
tant commonalities apparent to those 
affected, no common ground could 
be discerned.
The chief reason this puzzle cant 
be solved is because gastroenteritis is 
rather common, particularly this 
time of year. In the week following 
the initial outbreak, a total of 52 stu
dents, faculty, and staff reported 
some type of gastrointestinal distress.
It wasnt clear, of the people 
reporting, where it might have been 
connected, explained dean Michael 
Murphy of Student Affairs. Health 
Services did the right thing in trying 
to attain as much data as possible to 
look for a pattern, but it looks like the 
influx of possibly impertinent cases 
conflated the situation. Perhaps the 
source was viral, flu, or otherwise, 
but well probably never know.

AoTHE TARTAN  FEBRUARY 9, 2004
Legislatures should not undermine courts
recently in the news for declaring 
unconstitutional the forced recitation 
of the Pledge of Allegiance in public 
schools.
Once again, the nations reaction 
was based on knee-jerk reaction to an 
oversimplification of the case. In 
Newdow v. U.S. Congress, people 
reacted as if the court ruled the 
pledge itself illegal and unpatriotic. 
Instead of realizing that the 
Massachusetts supreme court is only 
making a provision for the mandated 
equal rights, people now are acting as 
if the court insulted the very concept 
of heterosexuality, which is simply 
ridiculous.
Whats worse, instead of consider
ing the ruling analytically, the people 
, and their representatives in the state 
legislature are pettily considering the 
addition of a constitutional amend
ment specifically
ning gay marriage. The amending of 
the constitution should be reserved 
for higher purposes than getting 
around a temporarily unpopular law. 
The U.S. tried that once; the 18th 
amendment to the U.S. Constitution 
enforced Prohibition. Over a decade 
later, popular opinion changed, and 
the 21st amendment repealed it. 
Though a majority of the population 
today does not favor gay marriage, 
the percentage that does continues to 
grow.
If people are concerned about the 
situation, they should be working on 
a petition to have the case heard by 
the Supreme Court rather than 
sneaking an amendment into the 
state constitution and undermining 
the judicial system. The reasons for 
separating the judicial branch of the 
government and making them unac
countable to nearly anyone are pretty
of popular opinion, freedom from 
political pressures, and the inability 
to be countered by the veto of a small 
group of people. The justices of the 
Massachusetts supreme court arent 
rogue judges; rather, theyre acting 
based purely on logic and the law, 
and without outside interference, 
just as they were meant to.
Certainly, the citizens of any state 
should be able to control their own 
lives, but only if they dont interfere 
with the rights of others. By banning 
gay marriage, the people of 
Massachusetts would be denying 
equal rights to homosexuals and lim
iting the freedoms on which this 
country was founded.

first-year in CIT and accepts all respon
sible replies.
Courts ignore their mandate in decision
ASSEMBLY, from page A8
spewing out ridiculous decisions. 
California citizens and lawmakers are 
powerless against it. The court 
answers to no one, its three-judge 
panel undeterred by their terrible 
record against the U.S. Supreme 
Court.
The point is that the American gov
ernment is organized so that judges 
in the judicial branch are not 
accountable to anyone, including leg
islators. 99 percent of the time this 
system works great, since the judicial 
branch needs separation from those 
whom they oversee. Problems arise 
when judges forget their place. 
Judges must first remember that they 
cannot have a political agenda. They 
are to take cases as they come and
rule based on a reasonable interpre
tation of the law, not a political ideol
ogy. The Massachusetts Supreme 
Court has forgotten this. Trying to 
legalize same-sex marriage behind 
the back of the state legislature 
undermines a historically sound sys
tem.
Agreeing or disagreeing with the 
Massachusetts supreme court is not 
important. What is important is 
understanding that the issue of gay 
marriage forces America to deal with 
sacred moral questions and implica
tions. But this is not the first time 
such an event has occurred. Our 
countrys structure and laws are 
based on the moral beliefs of our 
Founding Fathers. Such morality was 
embodied by a representative group 
of men elected by the American peo
ple to the Constitutional Convention 
over 200 years ago. These men were 
trusted with the authority to make 
moral judgments on the laws of our 
country. Now we are faced with 
another moral issue  that of gay 
marriage. Entrusting elected bodies 
beholden to the people, such as state 
legislatures and the United States 
Congress, is the only way to morally 
deal with the issue. So far 38 state 
legislatures have ruled on gay mar
riage. A few judges sitting at a desk in 
Massachusetts have no right to deny 
their state legislature the same 
opportunity.

THE TARTAN  FEBRUARY 9, 2004An
Mens team suffers tough defeats Super Bowls instant replay under review
MEN, from page A12
Tartans to overcome the deficit, 
which grew to 14 points with just 
under five minutes to play. Although 
a Barlow-Wilcox lay-up with 2:48 to 
iplay cut the lead to six once again, 
Carnegie Mellon could not come 
away with the win.
A couple turnovers at the end of 
the game prevented a comeback, 
added Wingen.
' -On Sunday, the Tartans traveled to 
Chicago to face the University of 
Chicago Maroons.
Despite having beaten the Maroons 
just over a week ago at home, poor 
Carnegie Mellon shooting allowed 
Chicago to come out with a 68-54
victory.
In stark contrast from their Friday 
night performance in St. Louis, the 
Tartans shot only 35 percent from the 
floor, including 12 percent from 
behind the three point line.
Kaitz led the Tartans with 15 
points and Divens added 11, while 
junior guard Eliot Goren added six 
steals on the afternoon for Carnegie 
Mellon. Chicagos Scott Fisher led all 
scorers with eighteen points.
As in the Washington University 
game, the Tartans gave up the lead 
four minutes into the first half, and 
were forced to play catch-up for the 
rest of the game.
Carnegie Mellon managed to keep 
it close throughout most of the after
noon, scoring six unanswered points 
at end the first half before going into 
the locker room down by seven, 
32-25.
Michael Divens layup started the 
second half, cutting the lead to five, 
but the Tartans never got closer. They 
cut the lead to six with under ten 
minutes to play on a Barlow-Wilcox 
free throw, but the Maroons pulled 
away to win by fourteen points.
The Tartans will try to halt their 
road struggles and end their three 
game losing skid this week as they 
visit New York University on Friday 
and Brandeis University on Sunday.
We need to pick up our defense, 
and we should be good for the 
remainder of the season, said Goren.

FOOTBALL, from page A12
good minutes in a room with the net
work execs and producers of this 
crap so I could just shout at them. If 
any of you do read this: your show 
sucked, your network sucks, and 
chances are you suck too. And while 
Im at it, all reality TV is crap. Also, 
why wasnt Office Linebacker 
Terrible Terry Tate back as a com
mercial?
That one was hilarious.
This year, the best commercial 
goes to the NFL Networks rendition 
of that song about tomorrow featur
ing fallen players chortling about 
their clean slate future: it wasnt half 
bad, particularly considering its dis
mal promotional contemporaries 
that aired between plays.
But enough of what pissed me off 
about the conclusion of the NFL sea
son, lets talk football. What a game, 
eh? The unheralded Jake Delhomme 
did a fantastic job, and actually 
deserved MVP of that game more 
than I can lead a last minute drive 
of 40 yards Tom Brady, whom, even 
as a huge Pats fan, I cannot stand. I 
began appreciating the Patriots 
when Drew Bledsoe was their QB. 
He was the man, and now Brady
benefits from the team Drew never 
had in New England.
He got shafted by Belichick when 
he got hurt, he was the reason they 
beat the Steelers two years ago, and 
he has done good things with a hor
rible cast up in Buffalo. He, and not 
Brady, deserves to be the head of this 
new dynasty.
Brady is a good QB, but not in the 
pantheon of greats with Montana, 
Elway, Marino, Young, or Favre. 
Bledsoe couldve been mentioned in 
that breath had he played with the 
current Patriots. But anyway, the 
MVP of the Super Bowl means just as 
little as the Heisman these days; it 
simply defaults to the QB on the win
ning team, making it tough to judge 
a career by simply looking at how 
many Super Bowl MVP trophies you 
have on your shelf in the den. Even 
Kurt Warner has one, and that guy 
isnt any good.
If you ask me, Deion Branch 
shouldve won the award; he had a 
spectacular game making huge 
catches against a very good Carolina 
secondary. Then there is Vinatieri 
who has now won two Super Bowls 
with last-minute kicks. Most kickers 
would kill for one (particularly John 
Casey who managed to lose that
game for his team by airing his kickoff out of bounds, changing the 
momentum, and giving New 
England a ridiculously short field), 
and this guy from one of the Dakotas 
has made two. Incredible; what a 
great thing to put on your resume; 
that is pretty much his ticket to 
Bostons hall of fame, and maybe 
even the football one.
Anyway, I figured that game 
would be close; the Panthers were a 
lot better team than people gave 
them credit for. They fought hard, 
they played like they werent just 
glad to be there, and they made the 
Pats earn that second trophy, and 
that is just what New England did. 
They earned that trophy more than 
any team I can remember. They beat 
the co-MVPs of the league this year 
in miserable conditions. They won 
15 games in a row, and they did it 
playing like a team instead of relying 
on one or two guys. This team 
should go down as one of the greats 
of all time, and when they win again 
next year theyll prove it.
Go Millennial Pats.

Lewis leaves on top
Heavyweight boxing champion, 
Lennox Lewis, announced his retire
ment in a London press conference 
on Friday. After a professional career 
lasting over 14 years, and a 41-1-2 
record, Lewis is the first heavy
weight champion to retire with the 
WBC heavyweight title since Rocky 
Marciano in 1956.
Ive completed all of my goals and 
now its time to say goodbye, said 
Lewis. I definitely wanted to say 
goodbye at the top and now I am at 
the top.
The champions last fight was a 
victory defending his title over Vitali 
Klitschko last June in Los Angeles. 
The fight ended in a controversial 
decision in favor of Lewis after 
Klitschko was unable to continue 
due to injury. Though Klitschko was 
leading the fight in points, he was 
unable to continue after suffering
serious cuts to his face.
The WBC ordered a rematch 
between the two by March 1 and 
HBO reportedly had made a deal 
with Lewis to fund the fight, but 
Lewis has assured the WBC that he 
will not return.
I will definitely be the third boxer 
to retire a heavyweight champion, I 
promise you that, the champion 
said. Other than Lewis and 
Marchiano, the only other heavy
weight to retire a champion was 
Gene Tunney in 1928.
Lennox Lewis now plans to pursue 
other interests, producing hip-hop 
and rap music and promoting con
certs. He has reportedly taken a posi
tion at a sports management agency.

Clarett on draft
On Thursday U.S. District Judge 
Shira Scheindlin ruled in favor of 
Ohio State running back phenom, 
Maurice Clarett, in his case against 
the National Football Leagues rule
requiring a player to be out of high 
school for three years before being 
eligible to enter the 2004 draft.
In her decision Judge Scheindlin 
wrote, [The NFLs rule] is precisely 
the sort of conduct that the antitrust 
laws were designed to prevent.
One can scarcely think of a more 
blatant anticompetitive policy than 
one that excludes certain competi
tors from the market altogether, she 
said.
As a freshman in 2002, Clarett led 
the Ohio State Buckeyes to the 
national championship, rushing for 
1237 yards. Clarett was unable to 
play this season for accepting 
improper gifts from a family friend 
and lying about it to investigators.
Though NFL attorneys vowed to 
appeal, Judge Scheindlin was not 
persuaded.
While, ordinarily the best offense 
is a good defense, none of these 
defenses can hold the line, she said.

Honors awarded to athletes
Carnegie Mellon teams set high-water mark for academic excellence
by Dan Ceppos
Sports Editor
Last week, both the mens and the 
womens cross country teams were 
awarded Academic All-American 
honors by the NCAA Cross Country 
Coaches Association. By the same 
token, five mens basketball players 
were selected to the National 
Association of Basketball Coaches 
Honors Court.
Both awards are based mainly 
upon cumulative grade point aver
age: the Academic All-American 
award is given to teams in which all 
members have a GPA of 3.1 or high
er in an academic year, while the 
National Association of Basketball 
Coaches Honors Court awards are 
given to individual juniors and 
seniors playing on the varsity level 
who have at least a 3.2 GPA.
As of the end of the 2002-2003 
year, the 24 runners on the mens 
team and 16 runners on the 
womens team had respective aver
ages of 3.57 and 3.52. Moreover, 
several of the cross country mem
bers  four men and one woman  
earned individual recognition for 
their achievements.
Junior Nicole Gartner was the 
lone individual representative of 
the womens squad, which finished 
11th in an NCAA regional meet on 
November 15 under the direction of 
head coach Drew Dershimer.
Senior Matt Meurer, graduate 
student Mike Rossi, senior Jared 
Markowitz, and junior Chris Carrol 
were all named Individual 
Academic All-Americans, playing 
for head coach Dario Donatellis 
19th place team at the NCAA 
Championships on November 22.
To Donatelli, the strong efforts 
and achievements of his athletes is 
nothing new, but this years team
was exceptional in both aspects of 
their well-rounded campus involve
ment.
[Academically,] the cross coun
try teams have ranked as high as 
second in the country and are usu
ally in the top ten for division three 
schools. I would expect a similar top 
ten ranking this year, said 
Donatelli. Athletically speaking, 
we have not finished worse than 
sixth in our region, which has more 
than forty teams, since 1981. This 
past season, we were second in the 
region and finished in the top twen
ty teams nationally.
Five players of the mens basket
ball team display similar achieve
ments. The averages of senior for
ward and captain Matt Kaitz (3.60), 
junior guard Eliot Goren (3.2), 
junior guard Gray Cole (3.75), 
junior center Michael Gibson
(3.96), and junior guard Baris Polat
(3.96) earned the competitors 
spots on the Honors Court team.
According to head coach Tony 
Wingen, these five players repre
sent everything for which the mens 
team stands on and off the court.
These, guys embody everything 
we want from our basketball pro
gram. They are good players, good 
citizens, good people, and excellent 
students. They certainly exemplify 
our ideals. They do a great job in 
practice, in games, and just the way 
they carry themselves as individu
als, Wingen said. I am very proud 
of their accomplishments.
Athletic director John Harvey 
views the recent honors for the 
cross country and basketball teams 
as a tribute to department as a 
whole, a department that has tradi
tionally set benchmarks for colle
giate academic prowess in all 
sports.
Were not only talking about one 
or two teams that deserve praise,
here, he said. This is an entire 
organization. The entire athletic 
department is made up of great 
individuals.
Within the University Athletic 
Association, Carnegie Mellons 
teams lead the conference for GPA 
in four sports. Golf (3.62), mens 
cross country (3.55), and both 
mens (3.31) and womens (3.44) 
swimming and diving all finished 
first in the UAA for the 2002-2003 
academic year; all Carnegie Mellon 
teams finished average or better.
Furthermore, Tartan athletes 
even raise the bar in the Carnegie 
Mellon community. The combined 
QPAs of the male athletes (3.21) 
and the women athletes (3.34) 
were both higher than the averages 
of those students who do not partic
ipate in varsity sports. The male 
undergraduates at Carnegie Mellon 
have an average of 3.16 and the 
women have 3.24 according to 
2002-2003 campus records.
The recent awards to the mens 
basketball and cross country teams 
are a testament to the efforts of 
individuals and the teams.
As far as recruitment goes, our 
coaches have very little bearing on 
the admissions process. Athletes are 
accepted based on the criteria for 
all prospective students and evalu
ated entirely within the admissions 
department, said Harvey. If [our 
athletes] can do better statistically 
than the rest of the average student 
body, then we definitely have some 
good people in our programs, he 
said. Taking into account that 
many of our team members are 
forced to miss classes on Fridays to 
travel for away games and meets, 
then all of our athletes definitely 
have a reason to be very proud.

Mens basketball loses twice
by Khalid El-Arini
Staffwriter
The road woes continued as 
CMUs mens basketball team lost 
their two University Athletic 
Association contests this weekend, 
losing to Washington University in 
St. Louis and the University of 
Chicago. The Tartans dropped to a 
3-6 conference record (11-9 over
all), with eight of their nine losses 
coming on the road.
On Friday, February 6, the 
Tartans traveled to Washington 
University Field House to face con
ference rival Washington University 
in St. Louis in a spirited rematch of 
the game played last Sunday at 
Skibo Gymnasium, in which the 
Bears came out on top. Carnegie 
Mellon lost by a final score of 
98-88, as Washington University 
improved to 6-2 in league play 
(14-5 overall), solidifying their 
hold of second place in the 
University Athletic Association
standings.
In a strong shooting night for 
both teams, junior forward Michael 
Divens led the Tartans with 22 
points and seven rebounds, going 
10 for 15 from the floor. Sophomore 
forward Clayton Barlow-Wilcox, 
sophomore guard A.J. Straub, and 
senior forward Matt Kaitz also post
ed double figures, with 19, 15, and 
13 points respectively. Barry Bryant 
and Scott Stone each had 23 points 
apiece for the Bears, to lead all scor
ers.
Carnegie Mellon rebounded from 
the offensive troubles they experi
enced last week against Washington 
University to shoot 58 percent from 
the floor, including an impressive 
53 percent from beyond the arc. 
However, Washington University 
came out stronger once again, 
shooting 59 percent, making 56 
percent of three-point attempts. 
The Bears held a more lopsided 
advantage when it came to the offi
ciating, as 26 fouls were charged to 
Carnegie Mellon while only twelve
were called against Washington 
University, leading to a 36-7 free 
throw advantage for the Bears.
Offensively, we played very well. 
We shot the ball well, moved it 
around well, and got some good 
shots, said Tartans head coach 
Tony Wingen. Defensively, on the 
other hand, we did not get enough 
stops, and did not guard them as 
well as we should have.
Kaitz agreed. On the road, the 
big thing is to stop the other team. 
We did not do that well enough.
The lead went back and forth to 
start the game until the Bears took 
the lead four minutes into the first 
half, forcing the Tartans to climb 
out of a hole for the remainder of 
the game. Carnegie Mellon kept the 
game close, going on a 7-1 run to 
end the half to go into the locker 
room down by six.
The second half started off with 
more hot shooting from both sides, 
but it was not enough for the

Yes, I saw the tit, the boob, the 
breast, the decorated nipple of Janet 
Jackson. I saw it. You saw it, and so 
did millions of people who were 
under the illusion that the game was 
the reason people gave a damn about 
Houston for two weeks in late 
January. Thank you, MTV, for taking 
the irritating trend of tragically lame 
halftime shows to a new low.
But it isnt just the halftime show 
that pisses me off; its all of the non
game stuff that surrounds the Super 
Bowl these days. The commercials 
always have to be funny (which they 
werent this year), the city has to 
throw parties for people who could 
care less about football, and of 
course, the intermission has be a 
spectacular light and sound concert 
featuring todays hottest stars. Well, 
you know what? All of that sucks.
At some point during the four-hour 
pregame show last Sunday afternoon, 
I flipped to MTV in hopes I could 
watch a Jessica Simpson music video 
without sound. I was greeted by a 
contest with the prize appropriately 
being two tickets to the game. One 
contestant was a die-hard Pats fan, all 
j painted-up and decked-out, while the 
i other, instead of the logical Panther 
counterpart, was a particularly 
annoying metrosexual who didnt 
even like football. That is right. He 
j wanted the tickets simply so he could

Thank God the Pats fan won the 
prize; I had my empty beer bottle 
loaded into the cannon attached to 
the right side of my torso, willing to 
sacrifice my measly 19-incher to 
release my anger at the whole situa
tion. On a day that should be as much 
a holiday as those Guinness commer
cials make St. Patricks Day seem, I 
spent a lot of time trying to figure out 
what the hell is wrong with our taste 
in entertainment.
That game was probably one of the 
best games we have ever seen, yet 
what is the world talking about? 
Justin and Janets ripping good time 
as the two teams prepared for their 
final 30 minutes of the season. But 
how can we not talk about it? That is 
what people walked away with: a 
sense of disappointment in a lame-ass 
halftime show. How many of those 
songs were actually hits anymore? 
What, MTV couldnt afford a set of 
pipes to sing something that people 
are still listening to? If I didnt hate 
MTV before this, my opinion has been 
solidified. I wish that I could have five

Crew cuts strong at
indoor competition
by Elizabeth Dobson
Junior Staffwriter
'f-The Carnegie Mellon University 
Mowing Club attended its only indoor 
rate on Saturday, hosted by the Three 
vers Rowing Association. The 12th 
annual Pittsburgh Indoor Sprints 
v^ere held at a new location at North 
Catholic High School on the citys 
North Side and featured a second 
place overall finish for the Tartans 
behind the University of Pittsburgh.
H'All levels of the club competed in 
races that consisted of 2000 meters 
ori a rowing machine. Novice rowers, 
varsity rowers, and even two of the 
cpiaches joined the competition. 
Competing colleges also included 
DUquesne University, RIT, Penn 
Siate, Case Western, and West 
Virginia University. The new location 
led to a few technical difficulties, as 
the computer system normally used 
for this event crashed early in the day. 
Scores were then taken manually.
System glitches were not confined 
to the event itself as Carnegie Mellon 
found itself down a few rowers due to 
injuries and illness. This resulted in a 
diminished performance by the team, 
vjith only a few individual medals 
and no team standings. The relay 
teams, consisting of six competitors 
each, took 4th place and 7th place 
respectively.
. It wasnt our best performance, 
bjit the team was strong overall, said 
hfead coach Donald Webber-Plank. 
rowed smart, competitive races, 
there werent as many personal
race, thats okay. This is going to be a 
different season for us, one that will 
be longer and more competitive than 
it has been in the past. Its good not to 
use up all the energy too early in the 
season.
Varsity assistant coach Ben Altholf 
was equally proud of the teams per
formance. This being his first Indoor 
Sprints experience with the rowing 
club, he was pleased to see how well 
the team worked together, both 
mens and womens as well as varsity 
and novice.
[Group support] is not something 
you normally see in most crew 
teams, he said.
Seniors Lenny Lucas and Neal 
Turbow certainly felt the teams sup
port during their final Indoor Sprints. 
Lucas, who has been with the team 
for two years, felt that being a senior 
really pushed him to put the maxi
mum effort into his race. While he 
only matched his personal best this 
time, he said he will always recall the 
intense atmosphere of the competi
tion. When I look back, Ill remem
ber the team backing me on every 
meter of that race, pushing me 
through the pain that just doesnt 
stop, said Lucas.
Turbow, who is finishing up his 
fourth year with the team, did man
age to attain a personal record at this 
race.
Indoor [competition] is a great 
way to set the tone for the rest of the 
winter and the spring seasons, he 
said. This being my last indoor, Id 
like to think that it will set the tone 
for a fun and successful spring seaRosemary Lapka/Photo Staff

Thinking outside the Frame
Design students show off their talent and flair
A colorful mlange of design projects is on dis
play this week at the Frame. A collection of work 
by 22 seniors in the school of design was 
unveiled last Friday. The exhibit, which is made 
up of the best pieces from the students four 
years at Carnegie Mellon, contains everything 
from video art to furniture to jewelry.
Much of the mixed media projects created by 
communication design majors are sitting on fur
niture made by industrial design majors. 
Everything on display, including the carefully 
arranged assortment of Pixie Sticks and Honey 
Nut Cheerios on the refreshments table, is a 
work of art. During the opening reception on 
Friday, live music was provided by Christy 
Berghausen, an industrial design major whose 
furniture was on display. Resting on one of her 
tables was a series of photo albums, including a 
Scottish landscape series by Becky Clutter called 
The Isle of Arran.
The exhibit also contains projects done by 
multiple students for specific classes. A montage 
of short video projects, created by students in a 
motion graphics class, is on display in the back 
room of the Frame. One of the walls is lined 
floor to ceiling with text created by five students 
in a typography class.
Truly unique is a collection on display by 
Courtney Chu, an industrial design major who 
loves to sew. In total, Chu has fifty outfits hang
ing in her collection. Her funky dresses, made 
out of vintage T-shirts may one day be worn by 
the iiber-trendy celebrities of tomorrow. In addi
tion, she designs clothing for dogs. To accompa
ny her collection of dog shirts, Chu has a photo 
album of dogs modeling her pieces.
Jason Petz, a communication design major, 
created several politically charged projects. A 
large cardboard cutout of George W. Bush rests 
suspended over a stack of pamphlets entided, 
What you should know about Cuyahoga 
County. The pamphlets outiine various prob
lems with Bushs environmental policy. I took 
pictures of people outside a factory in Cleveland, 
then gave them a copy of the picture [to] stick in 
one of the pamphlets, said Petz.
Accompanying the pamphlets is a series of the 
polaroid pictures taken by Petz in Cleveland. His 
second notable piece is a mock information 
pamphlet titled What Do You Do About 
Faggots? The small brochure is laden with 
priceless jewels of irony such as Recently, peo
ple have been believing that it is okay to be a fag.

A multi-level jewelry box on display, fashioned by Lisa Yanz.
Well these people are wrong and are probably 
faggots themselves. Intended as a lampoon of 
fundamentalist brochure, Petzs fake anti-gay 
pamphlet is laid out so well that it almost looks 
authentic at first glance. I was thinking about 
putting some of them in the office at Health 
Services, joked Petz.
Perhaps the most visually impressive work in 
the exhibit is the furniture. The delicate curves 
of Abby Sturges work, particularly the end table 
on display in the front window of the gallery, 
represent many hours of hard work. Industrial 
design major Matt Meurer has created a coffee 
table of aluminum rods and wood that includes 
blocks interlaced with fungus and pieces taken 
from a hundred-year-old barn.
The photos are portraits of fellow design stu
dent Hilary Kratovil, who, in turn, is showing 
her own photo series. I have a large Pez collec
tion, said Kratovil as she pointed out the details 
in her photographs of Pez dispensers. I wanted 
to convey each ones personality.
The Frame is open 12 pm-5 pm, Friday 
through Tuesday. Frame opening receptions are 
held on Friday, 7 pm - 9 pm. Call 412.268.2081

team record by scoring 100 points in a game against the

Dreams in Captivity
Students play gives a humorous look at human desires
If you just happen to be a soon-to-be college gradu
ate with big dreams and some major doubts about 
your future, then Gabriel Daviss Dreams in Captivity 
will strike a chord and hit a funny bone in you.
Davis, a current student in the school of dramas 
Master of Fine Arts program, must know from his 
friends stories, if not from personal experience, that 
obtaining ones dreams takes more than just having 
that certain spark.
Set in stereotypical small-town America, this play 
tells of one ambitious dreamers struggle to break free 
from mediocrity. It all begins when Livi (an ex-aspir
ing actress turned retirement home aide) runs into 
her old high school friend Pax (an ex-college student 
turned self-taught chef).
After one date at the zoo with a bunch of old folks 
and one scene change, our two dreamers elope.
Pax, the real (and delusional) motivator of the cou
ple, is bent on opening his own restaurant in LA, or as 
he calls it: The City of Stars. He jumps around (quite 
literally) trying to encourage Livi to just imagine 
him feeding the stars, while she is becoming one. Poor 
Livi actually cannot stand her personal chefs cuisine 
without drowning it in ketchup, but she manages to
smile, swallow, and allow her husband to continue 
cooking up fantasies in his boxers.
Whether Pax has too much blind ambition, or 
whether Livi has too little seems to be the question. 
The audience must decide if the protagonists dreams 
are obtainable or ridiculous. In other words, maybe 
Pax should call it quits, sell-out, and accept his role as 
a chef at the local Chicken Hut.
The other couple in the story consists of Livis older 
brother Barry (a stereotypical frat-boy turned hus
band) and his woman, Reina (a passive housewife 
turned NASA freak). While Pax wants to reach his 
metaphorical City of Stars, Reina wants to reach a 
literal one.
After one course at a community college, Mrs. 
Smalltown is ready to jump on the next rocket to outer 
space. Whether her astronaut ambitions are plausible 
does not seem to matter much because Barry  the 
ultimate obstacle between dreamer and dream  
keeps pinning her to the bed.
The climax of the play comes when both Livi and 
Pax are a quick loan away from moving to LA and 
making it big. However, it will take more than a botde 
of ketchup to convince good ole moneybags Barry to
invest in their elusive dreams.
Daviss dynamic characters and saucy scenes keep 
the audience chuckling and smiling despite the ups 
and downs of the dreamers plight.
The conservatory students who performed in this 
production also played a big part in keeping the audi
ence engaged. Christopher Henry (Pax), possessed an 
enormous and contagious amount of energy.
Also, the humor that Davis employs is geared 
towards a younger (one could say college-aged) audi
ence who can appreciate the fact that Paxs most 
prized recipes were tested on a bunch of stoners with 
the munchies.
However, the wonderful irony of the play is occa
sionally disrupted by moments of forced gravity. 
Perhaps the weakest elements are those scenes which 
demand a more serious interpretation; such as Livis 
soliloquies about a deep-seated emotional abuse. It 
seems best to let the dreamers and the audience 
remain in the more humorous and most enjoyable 
world of the dream.
Daviss imagination and passion for the theater are 
evident in this production, and they make being part 
of his characters dreams an enjoyable ride, or as his 
character Pax would say, a tasty treat.
Dreams in Captivity, which was directed by CMU 
drama alum and professor Geoffrey Hitch, is one out 
of four from the Spring 2004 New Plays Project 
being performed this month in the Purnell Center. 
These plays, which CMU students drafted this past 
summer and revised during the fall semester, are part 
of the curriculum for the master of fine arts degree.
They are the result of many theatrical studies, as 
well as guidance from a visiting playwright Ari Roth, 
who runs the Theatre J in D.C., along with collabora
tion among CMU professors and current conservatory 
students.
The student-produced plays from the Spring 2004 
New Plays Project will be running through the month 
of February. Admission is free. For further informa
tion, call the Drama Box Office at 412.268.2407.

Mirror mirror on the wall
A new exhibit at the Quiet Storm rethinks the personal dimension of art
Abstract art prides itself on being flexible; one can 
easily interpret a piece however one chooses. It is less 
common to be able to literally see yourself in a piece 
of art.
The Quiet Storm, a coffeehouse in East End, will be 
exhibiting local artist Ana Kellys work through the 
end of February. The show, called rflexions du voyeur, 
is a visual art display which uses mirrors to create 
unique art.
Todd Eckert, Kellys colleague and husband, said 
that there is more art in the series than they are able 
to display at the Quiet Storm, and that they are just 
using as much wall space as possible.
The Quiet Storm is not a typical venue for an exhib
it such as this; Eckert said that this sort of difference 
is a good way to gauge the work and immediate 
effect on the public, since they dont have expecta
tions.
Kellys last exhibit, shown in March 2003, was tided 
Dotted Lines and was best described as installation 
art. One major component of the show was fur-cov
ered household objects. Kelly was inspired by Harold 
Farlows psychological experiments with monkeys 
and false mothers.
Kellys educational background is impressive, 
though decidedly not art-centric. She studied anthro
pology and biology at Harvard, and attained a mas
ters degree in biology at Tufts. She also took a year of 
business school, and then dropped out. Five years 
ago, though, she decided to become a full-time artist.
I realized I really missed art; its something I had to 
do to survive emotionally, said Kelly. She started with 
charcoal sketches, and then moved on to self-portraits
 often nudes. However, it was not until she began 
creating abstract art that the impact of her work truly 
hit her.
I felt so exposed, said Kelly, commenting on 
Dotted Lines, her first major show. It took a long time 
for me to recover afterwards emotionally  I was not 
expecting that.
Her current style of art is more minimalist than her 
previous work. According to Kelly, it is usually very 
emotional, and much of it feeds off what she has 
been thinking about. Much of the art in the Dotted 
Lines show was about her family, especially her two 
daughters. Recendy, an art film of Kellys was shown 
during the Three Rivers Film Festival.
Rflexions du voyeurs overarching theme is mirrors. 
Each piece incorporates a mirror in some way; accord
ing to the Quiet Storm website (www.quietstormcof - 
fee.com/art/), each viewer is a de-facto collaborator, 
and by virtue of the reflection, must judge the work 
not only by what is presented, but also by his or her
sense of self-perception.
Kellys background in biology shows through again 
in this exhibition  she wants to force people to think 
about themselves.
Neurologically, its not possible for the brain to 
process your face and the art at the same time, said 
Kelly.
Her art uses a wide variety of materials, including 
spray paint, acrylic, wood, glass beads, black mica 
flakes, and, of course, mirrors. Many shapes and 
motifs are repeated throughout her works; these are 
supposed to represent emotions or ideas that are 
important to her.
Its never obvious what the art is about, and that is 
what is so powerful about abstract art. According to 
Kelly, the art is more accessible; you can take from it 
what you want.
Rflexions du voyeur is showing at the Quiet Storm, 
5430 Penn Avenue, through February 29. Admission 
is free.

A brief history of PONG
Why some classics will never die
Cultural groups define themselves by past accom
plishments and associations. Subcultures work on a 
similar basis, and one particular subculture  com
puter gamers  owes much of its present state to the 
early pioneers and, notably, the commercial success 
of Ataris PONG.
Despite the console wars, where the PC enthusiasts 
and console fanboys square off on which is the better 
platform, the faithful can look back to the early 70s. 
The birth of the commercial computer game did not 
originate on either consoles or PCs, but on the standup arcade machines of those golden years.
PONG is perhaps the most famous of the early 
games that helped launch an industry whose aggre
gate revenues (hardware and software on all plat
forms excluding PC hardware) approached $15 bil
lion in 2003. It started as a simple concept at heart, 
based on an idea originating from Magnavox, the cre
ators of the Odyssey video gaming system. It was at a 
demo presentation of the Odyssey system that Ataris 
Nolan Bushnell saw a demonstration of Magnavoxs 
TENNIS. The striking similarity between the two 
games later led Magnavox to sue the nascent Atari.
Although not the originators of the PONG game, 
Atari gets the credit with being the first to market it in
1972. The concept was first tested in a California bar, 
Andy Capps Cavern, where the clienteles quick 
enthrallment by it was described in Scott Cohens 
Zap! The Rise and Fall of Atari:
One of the regulars approached the PONG game 
inquisitively and studied the ball bouncing silently 
around the screen as if in a vacuum. A friend joined 
him.... One of [them] inserted a quarter. There was a 
beep. The game had begun. They watched dumb
founded as the ball appeared alternately on one side 
of the screen and then disappeared on the other. Each 
time it did, the score changed.... The score was 5-4, 
his favor, when his paddle made contact with the ball. 
There was a beautifully resonant pong sound, and 
the ball bounced back to the other side of the screen. 
... At 8-4 the second player figured out how to use his 
paddle. They had their first brief volley just before the 
score was 11-5 and the game was over.
Seven quarters later, they were having extended 
volleys, and the constant pong noise was attracting 
the curiosity of others at the bar. Before closing, 
everybody in the bar had played the game. The next 
day people were lined up outside Andy Capps at 10 
am to play PONG. Around ten oclock that night, the 
game suddenly died.
This quick acceptance of the arcade allowed Atari 
to start production on home PONG systems in 1975. 
Multiple other companies borrowed the concept and 
the market was soon filled with a bevy of other PONGlike games. PONG migrated to the IBM PC when it 
was introduced. The rest is history.
The number of PONG arcade systems only reached 
the thousands, but the cultural impact of PONG can
not be dismissed as any small feat. Its creators sought 
to bring computer gaming to the masses. The present 
state of electronic gaming on Xbox, Playstation 2, 
Gamecube, handheld game consoles, the PC, the cell 
phone, and the PDA seems to have fulfilled that 
vision.
With computer gaming nearly ubiquitous, new clas
sics will definitely emerge, and the gamers will be 
their judges, casting votes with their dollars and 
downloads.

Dropkick Murphys rock hard
They opened up a can on Wednesday at Laga
Lets go Murphys! screamed the crowd all night 
long. This hortative chant motivated both the 
Dropkick Murphys and all their fans at a sold-out 
Club Laga show on Wednesday. As their song As 
One suggests, the Murphys were in unity with the 
audience.
Indeed much of the Murphys concert experience is 
like watching football  soccer, that is  at the 
neighborhood pub. Fans go nuts jumping up and 
down, rooting for their shared favorite team to tri
umph. A handful of people brought homemade ban
ners, some depicting the Irish flag accompanied by 
Murphys logos and lyrics. Some fans got into fights. 
And there was even widespread show-us-yer-tits 
testosterone for the sake of completeness.
Whether Lets go Murphys! or Oi! Oi! Oi!, the 
chants were abundant. The latter reigned during the 
set, from Scruffy Wallaces opening bagpipe solo to 
the finale Skinhead on the M.B.T.A.
The song Time to Go is a sports cheer in its own 
right, telling the story of a trip to see the Boston 
Bruins play. Murphys bassist Ken Casey and drum
mer Matt Kelly are diehard fans of their native 
Bostons hockey team.
The Bruins support us. Were just giving it back, 
said Casey after the show, clad in a Bruins jersey. The 
Murphys covered the Bruins theme song Nutrocker 
on their 2002 live CD and performed at a Bruins 
game in November.
More seriously, the Murphys are adamant support
ers of workers rights. They dedicated one song to all 
the hard-working union men and women. They 
began their encore with Workers Song (Handful of 
Earth), the ultimate blue-collar anthem. The lyrics 
say that unappreciated workers are always societys 
first class to die, starve, and fight wars.
When all else fails, the Murphys just let their Irish 
pride shine. They have a true knack for covering tra
ditional songs like Black Velvet Band and Fields of 
Athenry. The bands successful formula combines 
punk rock guitars, bass, and drums with more tradi
tional Irish instruments. Their ebullience is likewise 
apparent in songs with Irish-American subject mat
ter, from immigration in Boys on the Docks to good 
ole drinking in Barroom Hero.
The Murphys latest album, Blackout, released in 
June, reflects a greater devotion to traditional instru
ments. Around that time, Wallace and multi-instru
mentalist Tim Brennan both joined the band. They 
replaced the legendary Spicy McHaggis and obscure 
Ryan Foltz, respectively. Brennan switches off 
between mandolin, tin whistle, accordion, and 
acoustic guitar during the live shows.
We blend the two together really well, said 
Brennan of punk and traditional Celtic styles.
Songs from Blackout dominated the nights set-list
 a dozen of the records 14 tracks were performed.
The fun jig-romp Bastards on Parade was the only 
notable exception. Fans joyously screamed along to 
Gonna Be a Blackout Tonight, Walk Away, and 
Buried Alive.
The albums standout track is The Dirty Glass, for 
which Stephanie Dougherty, the Murphys merchan
dise saleswoman, joined the band onstage. She and 
Casey delightfully traded vocals back and forth in 
this he-said-she-said anthem.
Dougherty only sang once, but her voice was the 
most beautiful music of the night. She admitted 
that she had more surprises in store for St. Paddys 
Day, for which the Murphys will play five hometown 
shows next month.
Barrs lead vocals, on the other hand, are coarse 
and gritty, reminiscent of his days in the much less 
appealing Bruisers. Barr has the ballsiest voice Ive 
ever heard, said Brennan. I think its beautiful in its 
own right.
We know that were just a bunch of shmucks that 
cant play for shit and sure as hell cant sing, con
fessed Casey on the bands live album. Somehow this 
doesnt matter, because the music rocks hard, has 
sing-along joy, and strikes a personal nerve with fans.
Guitarists James Lynch and Marc Kid Orrell deliv
er a sonic assault that any punk would respect. 
Orrells style of flailing his whole body while per
forming captures the essence of this intensity. The 
Murphys might not have complex musical parts, but 
the traditional instruments ensure that their music is 
anything but run-of-the-mill.
Fans crushed each other, jigged, and moshed like 
there was no tomorrow. Bouncers were visibly over
worked with so many people crashing the stage. The 
Murphys even invited tons of fans onstage for several 
of the songs.
Casey sung solo for one such song, Kiss Me, Im 
Shitfaced. He bragged about being soaked, soiled, 
and brown. Both inebriated and sober fans alike 
could relate after a dirty but worthwhile night of 
physical activity. They were all part of the game.
Its nights like these that I aspire to be Irish in a 
future life.

Love is in the air
Valentines Day holds myriad activities for students enjoyment
Get out your cards...
us.
Its coming...
Valentines Day is almost upon
The years most romantic holiday tends to elicit 
mixed feelings from college students. Depending on 
their view, they either greet it with cheers or groans.
Its a day designed to make all the single people feel 
lonely, said Simon Hucko, a first-year chemistry 
major.
Other students feel that celebrating Valentines Day 
is not worth their time. For them, love takes second 
fiddle to work as a priority. This sentiment was cer
tainly the overall impression that first-year psycholo
gy major Xander Veerhoff received.
There isnt much of a social life, said Veerhoff. 
People here tend to be very smart, of course, but they 
arent so smart when it comes to relationships.
Others believe Valentines Day to be a shameless 
marketing ploy, started by restaurants, card franchis
es, and candy companies. Today, the traditions asso
ciated with it are candlelit dinners, hearts, chocolate, 
and of course the most infamous of the four-letter 
words, love.
Its origins, however, belong in ancient Rome and 
the Roman Catholic Church. Originally, February 14 
was the Roman feast of Lupercalia. During the feast, 
young men and women would draw each others 
names out of ajar and then pair off with their chosen 
partner for the rest of the festival. Often, they would 
marry each other later on in life. The tradition of 
name-drawing lasted well into the eighteenth century.
As Christians started to adapt ancient holidays into 
their own calendar, they made the feast of Lupercalia 
into a saints day, for St. Valentine, or Valentinius. In 
third century Rome, Valentine was a historical figure 
reputed to be a Christian priest.
According to legend, Emperor Claudius issued a 
decree that would prohibit all young men in the 
empire from marrying, therefore making them eligi
ble soldiers. Valentine defied the decree and contin
ued to perform marriages for young couples in secret. 
He was discovered and sentenced to death, but young 
Romans left gifts of flowers and food outside his cell - 
thus originating the gifts of flowers and candy we give 
today.
He also is rumored to have fallen in love with the 
jailers daughter, and on the day of his death suppos
edly left her the first Valentine card, a note signed 
Love from your Valentine. His feast day, February 
14, is the day he is said to have been martyred in the
year 269.
The first officially documented Valentines Day card 
was sent in 1415 from Charles, Duke of Orleans, to his 
wife. While he was imprisoned for treason, the Duke 
wrote his wife a love poem and had it sent to her on 
the saints day. In the eighteenth century, men would 
send expensive gifts and cards with love poems to 
their potential spouses. During the nineteenth centu
ry, the holiday moved from being religious to secular, 
but its spirit remained the same. It is not only a day 
devoted to romance and couples, but also to all sorts 
of love and devotion.
In this spirit, CMU is taking steps to show that love 
is in fact in the air across campus, and not just on 
Valentines Day. One of the most notable develop
ments this past year is a new dating bboard, misc.singles.
A closer look reveals that the topic of love is even 
featured in the curriculum. For students looking to 
learn more about the psychology of intimate relation
ships, CMU offers a seminar for first-years titled 
Significant Others: How Do We Relate? The seminar 
focuses mainly on the psychological elements of 
romantic couples and close friendships and how the 
parties involved relate to one another. Love, in all of 
its manifestations, comes up quite frequentiy. In a 
recent class, Professor Brooke Feeney, who specializes 
in the psychology of close relationships, detailed the 
types of love and the way they affect college students.
She described how John Lee, a prominent Canadian 
sociologist, has come up with six types of love that 
describe the spectrum of relationships. They are eros, 
which is passionate and romantic love; ludus, or 
game-playing love; storge, the love of friendship; prag
ma, practical love; mania, which is obsessive love; and 
agape, the rarest form of love, which is totally selfless.
Overall, men tend to be more ludic in relationships, 
and women tend to be more pragmatic, said Feeney. 
As for erotic love, both genders tend to experience it 
equally.
What about college students?
According to a study done by husband and wife 
team Dion & Dion in 1985, college-aged males tend 
to be the more romantic of the two genders, Feeney 
stated. They also tend to fall in love more easily. 
College-aged women are generally more practical. 
However, when they do fall in love, they generally find 
it more rewarding.
Feeney also discussed psychologist Robert 
Sternbergs Triangular Theory of Love, which divides 
the concept of love into three components: intimacy,
gtCCE/dV 9 qnEeraeu 2004.
passion, and commitment. Sternberg has developed a 
test that evaluates a persons feelings in these three 
components, which in turn gives them an overall pic
ture of what type of love they are experiencing. The 
seminar also deals with issues such as communication 
methods, envy, and breaking up a relationship. There 
is an advanced seminar available (although not this 
semester).
Even if you know the origins of loves official holi
day, and the ideas behind love and affection, theres 
still the pressing issue of what to do on that day. 
Luckily, CMU students and organizations have come 
up with enough events on campus this Valentines Day 
for students to experience and put to use all six types 
of amour.
For those interested in finding a Valentine, you can 
buy love at a series of date auctions being held by stu
dent groups. On Saturday, February 7, a date auction 
was held at 8 pm in Skibo Coffeehouse, featuring sev
eral members of the School of Drama. At 8pm on 
February 13th, a similar auction will be held in the 
Connan Room by ALLIES along with fraternity Sigma 
Phi Epsilon and sorority Kappa Kappa Gamma.
There are 20 people being auctioned, and about 
half are GLBT [gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgen
der], said ALLIES co-president Vijay Jesrani. The pro
ceeds raised from the auction are going to the 
Pittsburgh AIDS Task Force and the National Youth 
AIDS Foundation. Each winning bidder is given a gift

---------------------------------------------------

Valentines Day doesnt have to be a day devoted 
only to romantic couples, nor does it need to be 
acknowledged with the usual candy hearts and cards. 
Its a day to show your affection for your partner, but 
also for your friends and family members, the people 
that really matter, said Courtney Shih, a first-year in 
SHS. Theres an entire spectrum of feeling to be cele
brated, and CMU is offering a variety of ways to do it. 
You might be able to make someones entire day, or 
week, better with just a card. You might find a little 
unexpected romance.
Who knows, this Valentines Day might even change 
the way you think about the L-word.

certificate donated by a Pittsburgh attraction. This 
year, the certificates range from free coffee at Kiva 
Han to a dinner for two at Lucca on Craig Street to free 
admission at the Andy Warhol Museum.
Usually, girls go for more than boys, said Catie 
Scudera, a first-year in H&SS and also an auctionee. 
Previously girls have gone for more than a hundred 
dollars. Each person gets their own song, a brief 
description, and a catch phrase, and the bidding starts 
at ten dollars. The average bid for a date is in the $40 
to $60 range.
Since its for charity, people are generous, and the 
event is a lot of fun, said Jesrani. More often than 
not, people are bought by their friends or significant 
others. This is the second annual auction held by 
ALLIES. We thought of the idea last year as just a fun 
event to bring the GLBT and straight community 
together for Valentines Day, and it was very success
ful. We raised over $1800 for the charities, and hope 
to raise even more this year.
In addition to the auction, there will be refresh
ments and a free massage.
For those who are pressed for time and cant attend 
an auction, there will also be a Valentine Speed 
Dating session sponsored by the Student Dormitory 
Council on February 14 from 2 to 4 pm (location is yet
to be determined). Singles will chat with a series of 
potential matches for five minutes at a time, and then 
narrow down their selections to one choice. Once the 
choice has been made, each newly paired couple will 
be given a gift certificate for two to Loews Cineplex at 
the Waterfront.
If you are interested in exercising your agape even 
more, consider making Valentine cards for charity. 
This year, CMU is making 400 Valentines Day cards to 
deliver to shelter, hospices and other charities around 
Pittsburgh.
The idea was spearheaded by Kristen Livesey, a 
first-year in SHS and a CMU Community Service 
Intern.
It was my idea to start the Valentines Day Cards 
and charity work because I used to do it in high 
school, said Livesey. Its a lot of fun and people real
ly appreciate it. The cards will be delivered to 
Miryams Shelter, a facility to help homeless women, 
as well as the Shepard Wellness Center, Little Sisters 
of the Poor, and Family House and Ronald McDonald 
House, homes for visiting families with children in 
Pittsburgh hospitals. In addition to delivering the 
cards, volunteers will also prepare and clean up after 
a dinner for the residents at these charities.
On Friday, February 13 from 4 to 8 pm, volunteers
will deliver Valentine cards and help prepare a meal at 
the Shepard Wellness Center. On Saturday, February 
14, from 4 pm to 6:30 pm, volunteers will also deliver 
Valentines and prepare a meal at Miryams shelter.
Students gathered in the New House study room on 
yesterday to make cards, but those interested can 
make cards themselves all week long.
Anyone that wants to get involved in this project 
can make cards in their dorm, said Livesey. If you get 
in touch with me I can come pick them up. Every card 
helps!
If you are also interested in celebrating Valentines 
Day the more traditional way, there are plenty of ways 
to show your loved one how you feel.
You cant go wrong with flowers, chocolate, or a 
teddy bear, said SHS first-year Leah Worbs. 
Preferably a combination of all three. This week, the 
Carnegie Mellon crew team will be holding a flower 
sale fundraiser in the University Center. The flowers 
will then be delivered at your significant others door 
all during Valentines Day. If you would like to sur
prise your other half with a bouquet, you can visit the 
crew table in the UC this week.
If youve decided not to go through the trouble of 
restaurant reservations, need a cheap date, or just 
want something to do in the spirit of Valentines Day, 
fear not. The Activities Board is featuring the roman
tic comedy Love Actually on February 13 in the 
McConomy auditorium. With a CMU ID, its only one 
dollar. On February 14 at 8 pm in the UC gym theres 
the Lunar Gala, an annual runway fashion and per
formance art show featuring student designs.

Scandalous!
Sex workers bring their artwork to Pittsburgh
Annie Oakley, director and founder of the Sex 
Workers Art Show (SWAS), began the project out of 
fury provoked by the double standard applied to 
those around her. Oakley was involved in a communi
ty activist center in Olympia, Washington at the time 
of the shows creation. When Oakley began sex work, 
she said she simply mentioned the job to her friends 
and colleagues at the activist center and their reaction 
was very negative.
Angered over her colleagues reactions, Oakley 
decided to have a sex workers show that would dis
play the talent of people in sex industries. I wanted 
them [her colleagues] to deal with people they all had 
these ideas about, she said. Oakley was determined 
to prove that sex workers were intelligent and highly 
artistic. The show has been running each year for the 
past seven years and has gone on a world tour; this 
Tuesday, it comes to Pittsburgh with the help of 
CMUs Womens Center.
The Womens Center has been involved in sex and 
gender issues on campus since 1990. It has helped to 
run the Vagina Monologues for the past five years, as 
well as possessing an enormous collection of genderrelated material, a greater collection than Hunt 
Librarys.
The Vagina Monologues are important to get 
women talking about their sexuality in a positive way 
instead of hiding it or feeling ashamed of it. And the 
Sex Workers Art Show fits right in with these goals, 
said Deutsch. The center helped with funding and 
planning for the SWAS with the help of an inspired 
local sex worker who had seen the show in another 
town and longed to bring it to Pittsburgh. Katie, a col
lege student who wished to keep her identity secret, 
enlisted the help of Emma Rehm and Rebecca 
Deutsch to bring the SWAS to a local venue.
Katie was excited and glad about the show and was 
happy to see it come to Pittsburgh. Her work in many 
facets of the sex industry makes the SWAS especially 
relevant to her. She spoke of how she believes that the 
show is important because many sex workers are 
demonized by those who know nothing about them; 
seeing the art may change their minds.
People have very negative experiences, she said, as 
well as positive ones, and it cannot simply be said that 
sex work is good or bad. A lot of bosses are really bad, 
she said, but also sex work does not have to be degrad
ing. She feels that any work that one has to do 
because one has no other choice can be dehumaniz
ing: it is not limited to sex work. Katie hopes the show 
will benefit others, especially those in the local com
munity.
Pittsburgh is the place I live [in]; this is my com
munity and I have a desire to see it be better. I hope 
people [will] get a lot out of [the SWAS], she said.
Rehm has continued to be involved in the Womens 
Center after her graduation from CMU. She expressed 
her determination to see the show make it to 
Pittsburgh when she heard about it.
let this slip by us! Pittsburgh is a really sexually con
servative town, and those of us ... who are very sexpositive want to see a lot more of this sort of thing 
happening.
Deutsch, a fifth-year senior in computer science and 
HCI, also played a role. She made sure that the 
Womens Center was aware of the SWAS and pro
posed that the center assist in bringing the SWAS to 
Pittsburgh.
I came in because [Katie] talked about it with 
Emma, and Emma thought it would be an event rele
vant to the Women's Center, and they needed some 
help with funding and planning. Emma told me about 
it and I loved the idea so I brought it up with other 
members of the Women's Center, Deutsch said.
The SWAS, as described by Oakley, contains a vari
ety of artistic styles, from a burlesque dance to poetry 
readings. Oakley spoke about the issues that bind as 
well as separate the performers. There is a real range 
of experiences in our group, said Oakley when asked 
about how the show displays both positive and nega
tive aspects of sex work. Also, performers got into var
ious levels of the industry and there are many differ
ent reasons for why they got involved. All the per
formers, however, believe that women have the right 
to do sex work. It is a cabaret-style performance that 
demonstrates the talent of sex workers through visual 
art that they create, short stories that they tell and 
musical acts.
Its a mix of visual and entertaining stuff with the 
political [topics], said Oakley. The show does contain 
acts of striptease, but Oakley felt that the content falls 
short of pornographic. Parts of the show address 
aspects of sex industries such as legalization of prosti
tution, or give commentary on the stereotypical 
beliefs of those outside the industry. Many involved 
in sex work believe that if prostitution was legalized 
then there would be more protection for prostitutes. 
As things stand, Oakley mentioned, so many abuses 
can go on because pimps do not have to answer to the 
law for the abuse of prostitutes.
Many aspects of the show are controversial, such as 
the issue of legalized prostitution, but Oakley said 
that most of the feedback that the SWAS receives is 
positive.
Coming to a show like this really humanizes people 
in the industry, said Oakley. One of the shows main 
benefits, according to Oakley, is to give people a 
chance to learn from the sex workers and to give other 
sex workers the opportunity to see that they, too, have 
potential as artists. '
The Sex Workers Art Show is a one-night-only per
formance held at the Mr. Roboto Project on Tuesday, 
February 10. The performance begins at 7 pm. 
Admission is $7.

AMP @ the Warhol
Art that thinks inside the box
Articulating opinions and feelings in the public 
forum may seem difficult for the ordinary person. 
Some are stifled by apathy, some are too preoccupied 
despite sincere intentions, and then there are some 
who remain quiet merely because words fail to suffi
ciently express their thoughts.
Yet it is these people that make us laugh, think, 
squint contemplatively, and tilt and scratch our heads. 
These are our artists. And evidently, as seen at the 
opening of a recent exhibition at the Warhol Museum 
last weekend, artists are not always eloquent public 
speakers.
Lydia Plottel, painter and graphic design student at 
the International Academy of Design and Technology, 
elaborated on a few points, but still left something to 
be desired: Its a different way of expressing myself. 
Ive always drawn and painted, and I cant imagine not 
doing it.
One hundred thirty-eight artists from around the 
greater Pittsburgh area came together to celebrate the 
start of a month-long exhibition of local artistry which 
opened at the Warhol last Friday. The event is part of a 
larger project know as AMP  Art Music and 
Performance  organized by the independent, non
profit Pittsburgh organization, The Sprout Fund.
AMP, a three-month-long series initiated in January 
with live music at Club Cafe, is spotlighting art this 
month, and will later move to performance art at the 
Brew House in March.
The concept was to create a 90-day initiative that 
would galvanize the creative community across the 
board of music, art, and performance, to showcase the 
creative talents of all of those disciplines, explained 
Sprout Fund director and CMU graduate Cathy Lewis.
The Sprout Fund, co-founded by Lewis and CMU 
Heinz School graduate Matt Hannigan in August 2001, 
is a community group focused on supporting the ideas 
of young talent. Likening the organization to a venture 
capital model in the for-profit world, Lewis believes 
the Sprout Fund is an entry point to help young peo
ple transform ideas from an idea stage to a reality 
stage.
However, as Hannigan points out, their mission has 
its challenges and obstacles. There are a lot of people 
that come here, for example, to Carnegie Mellon, for 
the world-class education. But often, when they are 
thinking about where they want to get a job, 
Pittsburgh isnt necessarily on the top of their list. Its 
about the way people perceive the region ... and were 
trying to improve the image that young people have.
The groups latest project, AMP, started out as a call 
out to local artists, driven by a combination of hand
bills and posters, as well as word-of-mouth through 
existing networks of local artisan groups, according 
to Hannigan.
We were really able to reach out to a large cross-sec
tion of artists. I think the response from the artistic 
community far exceeded our expectations ... and this 
opportunity has allowed 138 people to raise the visi
bility of themselves as artists, said Hannigan.
For self-employed salesman Jack Horneman, whose 
photo Night Vision is on display, this is a dream come 
true.
Its the Warhol! he explained. The Warhol is its 
own little entity, and anybody who can get something 
in here, well, theyre doing a little better than the aver
age.
From paintings to photographs, like one by N.R. 
Sterling capturing the high heels of a famous New York 
ballet dancer titled Blue Sole Peep Show, to a 
Monopoly parody by Steffi Domike lambasting the 
U.S. Patriot Act, the exhibit contains a collection of art 
as diverse as the region itself. Taken by the exhibitions 
freshness and diversity, local resident Nancy 
Anderson, whose daughters work is being displayed 
here, was impressed by the richness in the artwork.
I love the Warhol. This gives new artists an oppor
tunity to have their works be seen and it gives visitors 
an appreciation of all different types of media and all 
different ideas from all different ages. Personally, I like 
to see what other people are thinking and I like to see 
how other people are reacting to different things in our 
society, she said.
Despite the different subject ranges, let alone differ
ent types of media on exhibit, there is one similarity 
between the works  a very basic one, in fact.
The curatorial staff of the museum selected the for
mat of a 12" x 12" small-works show. They wanted the 
conformity, the mundane nature of a square as a con
stant to allow visual artists to use the format to exhib
it their work. Here, its all squares, and everyones indi
vidual vision as an artist comes through that square, 
said Lewis.
Thus, with this spectacular range of expression unit
ed by the simplicity of geometry, it is quite difficult to 
to describe the art displayed at the Warhol. If any
thing, it speaks loudly on the vivacity and pulse of the 
community. Lewis, dwelling on the words of CMU eco
nomic development professor Richard Florida, 
remarked that a critical criteria for a vital community 
is to have a creative community.
So then, what can be said about the art at the 
Warhols newest exhibit? Well, as one spectator in 
attendance at the Warhol asserted, after looking at a 
work by Toh Weiss, This work has...has...a Mona 
Lisa-like quality to it. However ambiguous thatcomment was, it may have been the most appropriate 
words said that night.
The Sprout Fund AMP exhibit is running through 
February 27.

In awe of Miracle
Kurt Russell puts aside his guns for hockey sticks and Olympic gold
It would be hard to spoil Miracle. The story is already 
familiar to anyone who lived through that time period, 
and 1980 is not that long ago. Even if you werent alive 
then, the title should give you a hint about how the 
1980 U.S. mens Olympic hockey team did.
The thirteenth Winter Olympics took place in Lake 
Placid, New York. The Soviet mens hockey team was 
widely considered the best in the world, while the 
American team was unranked. The Soviets were in the 
middle of a streak of over 42 games without losing. 
The Amateur Hockey Association just wanted a good 
showing, but coach Herb Brooks (Kurt Russell) want
ed more.
His desire to win brought him the position of 
Olympic coach, and his unconventional training 
changed a random group of college-age kids into the 
premier hockey team in the world, if only for one 
game.
The training had to bring together players from all 
over the country, though most of them were from 
Boston and Minnesota. At the beginning, there were 
bitter rivalries between some of the players.
After the first fight broke out, Brooks made people 
go around and say who they were, where they were 
from, and for whom they played. Brooks method of 
defusing this tension was to create a new one  all of 
the players grew to resent him more than their team
mates.
After the first pre-season game they played, Brooks 
wasnt satisfied with their performance (a tie). He 
made them skate sprints for what seemed like hours. 
He finally stopped when one of the players, after say
ing his name and where he was from, said that he 
played for the United States, rather than his college as 
everyone else had said before. I cried from sheer patri
otism when I heard that.
Brooks is obviously the focus of the story. Most of 
the players names were only mentioned once as he 
called out who made the first cut. It doesnt help that 
all the actors are cast very convincingly  it seems like 
all hockey players look almost exactly the same. 
Brooks wife (Patricia Clarkson) also shows up for a 
few scenes to remind the audience that Herb does 
have some life outside of hockey.
She also points out Brooks motivation for winning: 
he was let go from the 1960 Olympic team right before 
the Olympics began. That team won the gold, the last 
time an American team even made a decent showing 
against the Soviets, who dominated hockey through 
most of the 60s and 70s. A win as a coach was as close 
as he could get to Olympic gold.
The cinematography during the games is phenome
nal. On several of the goal shots, I hoped for an instant 
replay. The movie was realistic enough to not give me
one  the same as every hockey game Ive ever 
watched. The sound was less impressive. While part of 
this could have been due to a poor seat, some of the 
audio tracks bled together, making it hard to separate 
out the main voice. Also, because it is a Walt Disney 
movie, you may have to deal with the vocal track of a 
child behind you telling his mother that he has to pee. 
Repeatedly.
The wardrobe and props returned me to my child
hood. When A1 Michaels came on for the U.S.-Soviet 
pre-game show, it was on a Pelco-brand television. The 
ugly plaid pants on Brookss suit somehow seemed 
right. The movie was also cut with historic audio and 
movie clips.
These clips helped bring in the undercurrent run
ning through the movie  America was perhaps the 
most collectively depressed it had ever been since the 
Great Depression. Listening to President Carter trying 
to cheer up America was simultaneously droll and sad. 
With fuel rationing, the Iranian hostage crisis, and the 
Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, Americans wanted evi
dence that the world was not just getting worse.
They seized on the hockey team, the epitome of 
underdogs, as their sign of pride. Though Brooks 
began by discounting any greater meaning to the 
game, he came to realize that beating the Soviets at 
their own game was what America needed.
The acting was excellent. Though Kurt Russell was 
seen in almost every scene, he did not grow tiresome 
or fake. He looked the part of an ex-hockey-playerturned-coach, even down to the nose that looked like 
it hadnt quite healed right from a break. Most, if not 
all, of the hockey players in the movie really were 
hockey players, rather than actors. While they some
times seemed to be mugging for the camera, their 
freshness was entirely appropriate for their roles. The 
movie seemed to flow quickly from seven months 
before the Olympics opened to about two weeks in. 
Actually, the movie seemed much shorter than the 
two-plus hours it was.
The movie is perhaps the first based on a true story 
Ive seen that truly deserved the name. The dedication 
at the end to the real Herb Brooks, who died shortly 
after filming was completed on the movie, only served 
to underscore this point. The ending also went 
through the jobs that each of the teams members now 
holds, which was a nice touch. While not a perfect 
movie, this movie deserves three stars out of four.

Weekly inspiration from the ominously brooding pond
Rupert soon made friends even though he felt as if he was 
somehow above the other residents of the psychiatric hospital. There was Big Joe 
 a large duck with a strong, square bill and a bad case of kleptomania. When 
Rupert found articles of his clothes missing, he would waddle down to Big Joes 
room and demand back his underwear. Big Joe would reluctantly give up the lux
urious silk boxers that he coveted so. Then there was Coryn  the beautiful 
nymphomaniac. Late at night, Coryn would slip out of her room into Ruperts 
and proposition him. Rupert, who had realized earlier in life that all members of 
the fairer sex are to some degree insane, would gently turn down Coryn and lead 
her back to her room. Then there was Kent. Kent was an extremely intelligent 
duck. Kent had been enrolled in a prestigious university working toward earning 
a degree in a technological field. The pressures of school became too much for 
him, however, and he tried to set fire to the schools mainframe. Usually Kent just 
burbled nonsense conspiracies about the man, but one day he said something to 
Rupert that would change his life forever...

Heroes for Hire Get Back to Work
Power Man and Iron Fist; Luke Cage and Danny 
Rand; Heroes for Hire. No matter what you call 
these guys, it doesnt change the fact that they have 
been out of business for quite some time. Since 
their series dissolved in 1986, the mercenary dogooders have had a hard time holding a steady job. 
Although Luke and the Fist have occasionally found 
their way into a miniseries or a short-lived ongoing 
title, shining moments have been few and far 
between.
But the heroes for hire are officially employed at 
Marvel as of 2004. Although Cage and Iron Fist will 
be appearing separately, work is better than no 
work for these characters. A series featuring the 
characters, along with She-Hulk, Ant Man, and 
other out-of-work Avengers, was launched in 1997. 
After it folded a year and a half later, Iron Fist left 
for Hollywood and Power Man received a hip-hop 
makeover.
Luke Cage was created in the early 1970s by Stan 
Lees protg Roy Thomas. From the outset, Power 
Man was easy to criticize in an industry featuring 
few African-American superheroes: an escaped 
convict with a foul mouth operating as a merce
nary. Questions were constantly raised about 
Cages character: Is he good or bad? Will he 
work for anyone as long as they pay? This meant 
tales featuring Cage had to constantly crush nega
tive stereotypes perpetuated by his existence. But 
the original Hero for Hire was just that  undeni
ably superhero material. Luke Cage always let his 
noble spirit slip through his indifference, often get
ting distracted in his work and helping people who 
werent paying him. Although Cage would rage on 
his opponents, he was never a killer. This is what 
would separate Power Mans anti-hero stylings 
from those of followers such as Wolverine and the 
Punisher.
Daniel Rand was the product of Gil Kane and Roy 
Thomas, born in the pages of Marvel Premiere. Iron 
Fist soon came under the guidance of Chris 
Claremont and John Byrne as he moved into his 
own title in the mid-1970s. While Chris and John 
would go on to tell the Dark Phoenix saga in X-Men, 
Iron Fist would travel to the pages of Luke Cage, 
Power Man. Here the infamous duo began their 
legacy as foils for each other. While Luke was 
assertive and aggressive, Danny acted skilled and 
calm while battling to believe in himself.
Iron Fist summons an ancient mystical power he 
collects through his life force, or Chi, and infuses 
his clenched hand with the strength of metal. 
Orphaned at a young age, Daniel grew up in the 
magic city of his fathers birth, Kun Lun. Trained to 
be the next carrier of the Iron Fist, Danny set out
from his home to find the man responsible for his 
parents death. Although the series was never a 
runaway hit, Power Man and Iron Fist were suc
cessful enough to survive. The heroes for hire were 
given further character development by writer Jim 
Owsley towards the end of their run. Yet despite 
the best attempts to continue the series, the 80s 
left the characters feeling too dated. In the minds of 
readers, Cage resembled a super-powered Shaft, 
and Iron Fist seemed a Caucasian clone of a magi
cal Bruce Lee.
Since then, Danny Rand has bounced around as a 
guest star, only sustaining minor miniseries outings 
on his own. As Marvel began to shop around char
acters to film producers, Iron Fist was a surprising 
name which shot to the top. The project seemed on 
the cusp of being a Hollywood film, when all of a 
sudden it was abandoned with the success of 
Spider-Man and other Marvel blockbusters.
Lacking in West Coast exposure, Luke Cage had 
slightly better success in comics than his former 
partner. His own title lasted for over a year before 
cancellation. Most recently, Luke Cage appeared in 
his own Marvel mature readers limited series. Yet 
Power Man was a concept of the past; Cage was still 
a mercenary struggling to do good, but his style 
reflected rap culture instead of his original leaning 
towards blaxploitation films.
But Marvel has big plans for the former merce
naries over the next couple months. Ready to hit 
the racks any week this month, Secret War is a quar
terly series set to reintegrate Luke Cage into the 
Marvel realm of heroes. Although he is one of many 
heroes featured in the tale written by Brian Michael 
Bendis and painted by Gabriele DellOtto, Secret 
War will have Cage as a major player. Along with a 
guest spot in Bendis ongoing February debut series 
The Pulse (formerly Alias), Luke Cage has a chance 
to punch his way back to popular favor.
sNot to worry  Iron Fist wont be standing by 
idly as Luke grabs the spotlight. This March will see 
a new ongoing Iron Fist solo series written by Jim 
Mullaney and drawn by Kevin Lau. In the first story 
of the title, Danny Rand will return to Kun Lun to 
battle evil forces threatening the mortal world. Will 
Luke Cage join in the fight? It seems as though 
these two heroes will continue to seek employment 
separately for the time being. Whether or not 
together, Luke Cage and Iron Fist should simply be 
happy to be hired.
