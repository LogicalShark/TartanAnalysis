NIGHT SCIENCE MEN HOLD ANNUAL BANQUET
Pictures Taken at the Slavonic Ball in the Design SchoolHEALTH DEPT. AT TECH RECEIVES RECOGNITION
On Saturday night, December 16, 
1916, the Night Science men held 
their annual banquet at the Schenley 
Hotel. Dean Leete, Dean Connelly 
and Prof. H. S. Hower were present 
and did much toward making the af
fair a successful one with their in
teresting and entertaining tallcs. 
About seventy-five night men were in
 attendance. The committee in charge 
deserves much credit for the splen
did way in which the affair was 
managed.
Dean Connelly spoke of the ear
lier history of the school, relating 
several interesting incidents of the 
life of. Andrew Carnegie.
Dean Leete related the progress of 
the night school, saying that a man 
working during the day and going to 
school during the night deserved 
much credit. Prof. Hower proved to 
be the usual excellent entertainer. 
The editor of The Tartan was also 
called upon for a few words, in 
which he set forth the relation be
tween the (lay and night schools, and 
the policy of "The Tartan in refer
ence to the night students.

SOPHOMORE CLASS GIVES SECOND ANNUAL BANQUET
On Wednesday evening, December 
13, 1916, at the Fort Pitt Hotel the 
sophomore class of the science school 
gathered for the second time in their 
career in a light spirited banquet. Fol
lowing up their record of 96 per cent 
as Plebes, the Sophs turned out "Tout

beforehand due to half hearted and 
unsuccessful attempts on the part of 
the Plebes to abduct E. Butts, soph 
president. But through them all Butts 
rested safely in his room at the Fort 
Pitt Hotel.
On the entrance of Dr. Harris a con

That the life of Europe after the 
greatwar will be strongly influenced 
by the political ideals of the United 
States and by this country's com
mercial methods is the prediction of 
Henry I-Iornbostel, patron of the 
school of applied design, Carnegie 
Institute of Technology, and for 
years a resident abroad.
"In a similar way, Mr.. Hornbostel said recently, "a new idealism 
which will vitalize life in Europe 
when peace is declared, a spirit akin 
to that which prevailed in the days 
of the renaissance, will be felt to a 
marked degree in this country, and 
will do much to elevate its stand
ards and assist in its artistic 
growth.
The influence of America upon 
Europe in the years just preceding 
the war, according, to Mr. I-Iornbostel, was everywhere perceptible. The 
methods of business and the modes 
of living here were slowly making 
their impression upon the European 
nations. The power which caused 
this Influence, he said, waa the same 
power which, in an approximate 
standardization of life in I he broad 
expanse of thin country, ha achiev
ed one of the most remarkable na
tional conditions In the history of 
the world; that is, the power of 
commercial progress and efficiency.
Influence Is Universal.
"I have just returned, Mr Hornhostel continued, "from a trip of al

he say concerning the coaching of 
the team, he had nothing but praise 
for the men who wore the Plaid, giv
ing their spirit, their courage, all 
the credit. No doubt he was right in 
part, but we all know who put this 
spirit into the men. The name of 
Steffen is dearer to the hearts of 
Tech men today than is the memory 
of ills work, It would bo a sad day 
when we could no longer look for
ward to his return in the fall.
Of course it cannot bo hoped that 
if the assemblies are to be held each 
month that they can be as good in 
the future as was I his one. But the 
possibilities of making a more 
United Tech" with these assemblies 
ire wonderful. We trust that the 
proper steps will be taken to make 
these assemblies a regular institu
tion, one of the traditions of the 
school.
A DISCOURTESY
here was one incident at the gen| 
eral assembly which it seems to us ' 
worthy of drawing to the attention of 
the student body. This was the be
havior of the majority of the students 
in beginning to leave the Music Hall 
x few minutes before the close of the 
program. About live , minutes before 
the affair was finished several stu
dents walked out, soon more followed, 
till at the very close of the presen
tation of letters to the football men 
about three-fourths of the students 
were leaving. This conduct seems to 
us not only highly discourteous, but 
shows a lack of sense of. duty, and a 
lack of training which we hardly be
lieved possible from Tech students.
We believe it was merely thought
lessness, and trust that a re-oc
curence of poor behavior will not take 
place again.
FIRST PRIZE IN BEAUX ARTS CONTEST
A RESPONSIBILITY
Our attention has recently been 
called to a production Written and 
Produced In Pittsburgh by Students, 
and ,.1'rom what wo have boon abl 
to gather this affair Is one which 
merits the utmost disapproval 
every Tech student. And yet it is 
said that some Tech men are boost 
ing the enterprise; It Is farther al 
logod that the affair is to ho a sort 
of a return for the Pitt-Tech smok
er hold at Tech last year. We are 
not sure of tills, Inasmuch as Hi 
publicity department of (ho "Frolic1 
seems to be XI ashamed of the 
nature of their enterprise that on 
cannot find tho leaders.
We L'ool that we cannot too 
strongly denounco the men who are 
supporting such an affair, pnrtlcu 
htrly If the name of "Carnegie 
Tech" is to be brought In con
nection with it. When a student 
adopts the name of "Tech Student,, 
he .immediately takes upon himself 
certain responsibilities, one of which 
Is that he must do anything and 
everything in his power to safe
guard the name ol his school. He 
must guide his actions in such a 
manner that there will be no pos 
iibility on the part of the general 
public to bring slander upon the in
stitution.
And tliis is exactly what would 
be brought upon the name ot any 
school, if even a small minority of 
its students should support any en
terprise of the nature of the afore
mentioned affair
FurUiermore if there should be 
any truth in the fact that tnis is 
intended as a return for the PittTech smoker, we feel that such an 
entertainment, if it may be caled 
such, is entirely out of harmony 
with the principles which prompted 
the joint smoker of last (year.
From every viewpoint, and par
ticularly that of duty and responsi
bility to the institution, this af
fair warrants the scorn of every 
true Tech student.
A THOUGHT FOR THE NEW YEAR
We are not going to suggest any 
New Year resolution, but a thought 
which will be of infinitely more value 
than many resolutions only to be 
broken. It is a part of Longfellow's 
"Psalm of Life:
"Trust no future, howe'er pleasant.
Let the dead past bury its dead,
Act, act, in the living present
Heart within, and God oerhead.
A beautiful thought! It needs no 
explanation, one could hardly imagine 
a more appropriate New Year thought, 
for with this as a guido, no one could 
stsray far from the true path.

ment of these four corners and in 
the occurrence of a central object 
of more or less monumental charac

Where the central object is small, 
like a mere lamp post, and traffic 
allowed to hug it closely, this type 
of plan is thoroughly convenient for 
traffic, but none of these designs 
are very distinguishable as works of 
art..
Design numbered 11 is interesting 
as the only one which provides a

by all car lines and protected from 
automobile traffic. It offers, however, 
unreasonable obstacle to through

ed the pale blues rand pinks of the 
rising sun in the .distance while the 
immense gathering place was lit .with 
the fiery reds and warm yellows of 
imaginary torches and fires. J. Nor
wood Engle, who was responsible for 
these electrical effects, outdid him 
-elf and deserves a great part of 
?he credit for the impressiveness of 
the spectacle.
The foyer was beautifully draped 
as was the exhibition room to re
semble huge canopied halls and were 
wierdly illuminated.
The musicians, led by the wonder
ful Gilg, were fittingly attired in 
Slavic costume and were stationed 
on a specially constructed platform 
built over the steps in the foyer. 
They produced music such as lias 
seldom been heard at such an af
fair. Their rendition of Dixie 
drew forth rounds of applause and 
elicited "Rebel Yells such as have 
never before been heard north of 
Gettysburg.
The costumes worn were unsur
passable in their range and marvel
ousness. All of one period the var
ied and conglomorated types of Slav
ish costume were portrayed with an 
originality in. selection of color and 
design' that only artistic imagination 
spurred to deepest effort could at
tain. Colorful garbs of every type 
of Slav," jewels, paint and pomp 
blended to make the picture.
Until a late hour in the evening, 
all who partook of the festivities 
were masked. At midnight, after un
masking and led by the'faculty and 
specially invited guests, the dancers 
marched into the guest banquet hall 
where they seated themselves at 
small tables and were served with 
food of substantiality. Miss Katherine 
Jones and Mr. George Trent as ban
quet committee, acquitted themselves 
very commendably of their duties. 
Oyster patties, ice cream, coffee and 
cake, constituted the menu and were 
thoroughly relished.
During the course of .the banquet 
cabaret features were produced by 
dramatic students.
Dancing continued until three 
oclock in the morning when the 
blinking lights informed the gay 
revellers that the night of rare 
revelry was spent, and the Slavonic 
ball another chapter in the Design 
School History of Brilliant Affairs.
The success of the affair is due 
to the combined efforts of all the 
committee but, as usual, two or 
three committee men stand heads and 
shoulders above the others. Arleigh 
B. Williamson lias been mentioned 
creditably on several occasions be
fore in connection with his duties as 
head of the Design School Student 
body and chairman of The commit
tee. Without his genralship and 
untiring efforts there would have 
been no ball. Marvin C. Adams, as 
construction general, built the skele
ton and Homer Ludwig covered it 
with his cleverly designed draperies.
The ten thousand yards of cloth 
were dyed and sewed by the 
plebes and girls of the school, while 
the stenciling and painting was also 
done by students. No outside aid 
was employed in the staging of the 
immense spectacle.
The committee expresses great ap 
preciation for the following who 
have devoted much time, effort and 
sometimes financial assistance. Mrs. 
Hornbostel, Dean Bossange, Miss 
Bennett, Mr. Orbin, Mr. Morgan and 
others of the facuitv.

This association, under the lead
ership of George H. Smith, started 
a scholarship to be given each year

L. W. Sherwood. He was given his 
award by A. H. McGill.
E. S. Rauh represented the 1915 j 
class in two awards. The junior 
award went to F. I. Lawson, while 
E. A. Bolts received that of the 
sophomore.
C. T. Fletcher was awarded the 
1916 scholarship through B. Schwarz.

Cement. TestsThe series of teste 
on cement, cement mortar and con
crete, which has been carried on in 
the Materials Laboratory by Profes
sor McCullough during the past year 
for the American Society for Testing 
Materials, will be completed shortly

was made in order to determine the 
importance of the standard tension 
test of cement and cement mortar in 
indicating the compressive strength 
of cement mortar and concrete made, 
with the same cement. In order to 
obtain average results similar series 
of tests have been made at Cornell

M, M. C. S. BAZAAR
IS GREAT SUCCESS
(Continued From rage One.) 
were Sto many social affairs this fall 
it was decided this year to combine 
the dance and bazaar.
Another social affair of the school 
has been the annual Christmas party,1 
which originated in the first giving of 
the Christmas pageant. So the Boars 
Head march has bocoine traditional in 
the M; (M. C. S. and this too was given 
on Wednesday evening.
The evening was celebrated by the 
three events, the bazaar opening at 
7:30 and continuing through the evoning, the Boars Head march at. 7:30 
and dancing from 10 until 12.
The affairs .were held on the third 
floor, which was decorated with holly 
and Christmas trees. The pine trees 
certainly gave one the feeling that 
Christmas was really coming.
On the second floor the Athletic as
sociation had special tftuhts and-sideshows for which admission was 
charged, the proceeds of which were 
given over to the Guild Fund. Some 
of thetie were very clever and amus
ing.
To tlie right of the stairs on the 
third floor an attractive Inn had been 
arranged, where home-made pies were 
served hot and ice cream, coffee and 
home-made cakes.
The first booth was the Home Arts 
and Crafts. Many, many hours had 
been spent .in making articles for 
the booth. The work of the girls 
was really wonderful. Attractive jew-, 
elry, liand-painted Christmas cards, 
scarfs and baskets were sold.
The next booth sold the Annual 
Guild Calendars and Red Cross Seals. 
This is part of the Guilds Charity 
work to sell Red Cross Seals every 
year.
The Home Economics Girls had an 
attractive array of home-made candy 
and cakes in the next booth. It is 
needless to say these sold very rapid
ly.
The Costume Economics girls had 
a very attractively arranged booth 
with many lovely articles for sale. 
These girls certainly are to be com
plimented on their business ability, 
for they certainly knew how to make 
good sales.
The whole bazaar was very suc
cessful and all the girls certainly dis
played the spirit of good will and 
ability to work.
The Boar's Head march was held at 
9:30. About fiO of the M. M. girls 
were dressed in white. The proces
sion was led by the one girl carrying 
the Boar's head and the other girls 
carrying lighted candles. The pro
fession proceeded from the assembly 
hall up to the recreation hall. Christ
mas carols were sung by the girls as 
they marched and repeated in the 
recreation hall.
After the singing of the Christmas 
carols, a dance followed. Five cents a

JAMES L.PAYNE
1-Ie was a member of the Southern

ter member of the Southern Club of 
C. I. T. 1-Ie was a member of the 
Presbyterian Church. 1-Ie is surviv

Howard A. Payne, his brother, Mr. 
Booyer Payne, and four sisters, Mrs. 
C. 13. Bostwick of Pensacola, Fla., 
and Misses Lucile, Mildred and Mary 
Gene Payne.
Those who knew him know that 
no printed word could express the 
sterling worth _ and character of 
James Leon Payne.
Surely he has built a monument 
to himself in the hearts of those 
who knew him and when wo look 
upon our college life we feel that 
we have all boon helped by the as
sociation with so noble a character. 
We extend tho deepest sympathy to 
his family and friends in their bei onvomont.
SOMEWHERE IN FRANCE
TECH ALUMNUS WRITES
(Continued from Pago One) 
have not written.
I left Pittsburgh in March with 
Dr, .lane Ol'nvon as a member of 
the Pittsburgh Field Ambulance. In 
Paris, after making extensive in
quiries where we could be of most 
use, Dr. Craven eventually decided 
to take advantage-of the opportunity 
which offered of attaching the unit 
to the.,Hospital of Mlle. la Comtesse 
de Baye, near the Franeli front. Ac
cordingly negotiations were taken up 
for this purpose with the French 
Militarily authorities, and in ' May 
Dr. Craven .was sent up to the hos
pital as a nurse.
The question of getting the Motor 
Ambulancea foreign car driven by 
a foreign driverto the hospital was 
a more .difficult one, and I, was kept 
expecting to receive instructions to 
go up from Paris. I * waited for 
months, and eventually decided to 
join the British Red Cross and join 
a British Unit working in France 
and with the French army. This re
quired about six weeks before I was 
finally on my way to the scene of 
action, and now I am taking the op
portunity of letting my old friends 
of the C. 1. T. know that I am alive 
and working in the cause of civiliza
tion against, the overbearing, syste
matic, monarchical, autocratic mill 
tarism that has plunged tho world 
into a bloody war. Germany, as slv 
was, was a menace to the ideals of 
democracy, for which the United 
States stands and lias stood as the 
greatest, champion. So Germany 
must be crushed, and the U. S. A. 
Is giving, and will continue to give, 
support.
Our particular unit consists of 20 
Buick motor ambulances, and we live 
under canvas. At the time 1 joined 
the unit was in repose and cleaning 
up and putting everything in order, 
after six months hard work. It was 
encamped near a small town, some 
30 miles behind the lines. Then the 
unit became attached to a French 
army division, and this means that 
the ambulances pick: up the wounded
called evacuating.
We camped for a few days where 
the division was quartered in vil
lages waiting for a part which had 
not arrived, and we evacuated the 
sick from these villages around to 
the hospital at a town farther back. 
Then the division, being  complete, 
moved on and so did we. Now we 
are encamped a few miles behind 
the lines, and work is going on in 
earnest, although at the time of 
writing, we are not at all hard 
pressed.
There is a poste some little dis
tance away to which the wounded 
are carried from the spot at which 
they receive their wounds, by brancardiers or stretcher-bearers. These 
men are French soldiers, and their 
duties are of the most dangerous, 
arduous and thankless kind.. Fre
quently they have to carry Iheir 
burdens of human wreckage over un
even, open ground, exposed to the 
fire of German guns.. They can only 
move onwards and trust that no bul
let will find its billet in their 
bodies.
They do all their work at night, 
and only too often the bodiesof 
two stretcher-bearers and their hu
man freight are found. riddled with 
bullets lying in the roadway and, 
perhaps, trodden into the mud ere 
they breathed theirlast. The poste 
is in the midst of a scene of deso
lation. Gaunt tree trunks stand up 
with branches blown away and a 
few frayed edges left. These char
red remains are the remnants of a 
forest of two years ago. Those, four 
semi-roofless walls with two big shell 
holes in the side once were part of 
a flourishing farm house. All these 
big holes in the ground, from three 
to twenty feet across, are shell 
holes. Yonder in the distance tho 
masses of brick and mortar and 
stone and the walls and chimneys 
and church tower are the remains 
of a village, and all the strange 
things lying just off the road cov
ered in gray mud, remind one on 
closer examination of automobiles, 
uniforms, caps, rifles, boots, pianos, 
and all .kinds of household and per
sonal attributes.
To the poste, about S00 - yards 
from the German trenches, the car 
on dut y goes. Perhaps it is I night, 
and the car sets out at its appointed 
time and without light runs slowly 
along the road, and probably in pour 
ing rain and mud inches deep. 1' 
takes all corners very slowly, un
less enemy shells are falling near 
and its horn is going continually. It 
passes convoys on the road, men 
marching, guns, supplies, and just 
escapes tho ditch in passing, thorn. 
Guns speak from different spots 
with blinding flash and deafening 
roar, and eventually the ambulance 
arrives at the spot dug into tho 
hillside, whore recently wounded 
soldiers are waiting, bandaged up, to 
be taken to a station* farther back, 
Tho ambulance Is loaded with 
some blesses on stretchers, groan
ing, parts of their bodies wrapped 
around with blood-stained bandages, 
and with others able to walk, who 
sit in tlie ambulance.- The back of 
the car is shut down, the two driv
ers mount the seat and, more slowly 
than before, and more, carefully, the 
car makes its way to the clearing 
station. That hump on the ' road 
was an old shell hole, but the driver 
could not see it, for it is very dark. 
The sky is cloudy, and there is no 
moon, and a flash from a gun oc
curred which, for a second or two, 
made it impossible for the driver to 
see at all; but it did illuminate 
something coming up the road, so -he 
blows his horn and keeps to the 
right and hears an answering horn, 
and soon a loaded lorrie rumbles 
past.
Slowly and carefully, mile after 
mile, is covered, ruins of villages 
passed through, and at last the 
casualty clearing stationa church 
with the roof pierced and wrecked 
by shell-fire at: one endis reached. 
The ambulance is opened and the 
wounded taken out, one poor fellow 
has died on the way. We had to 
move quickly over one part of the 
road, for three enemy shells ex
ploded not very far off, and perhaps 
that may have been the last straw. 
The car Is emptied and we go back 
to where we make our post for the 
night, and wait, till it is our turn 
for another journey to the dug-out 
on tho hill, three hours later, to 
bring back more wounded. So the 
night passes, pay duty is not such 
a strain, for there is not. that con
tinual anxious peering into the black
ness 'and the guns do not speak so 
often.
Perhaps one makes a trip, during 
tho day with an older and more ex
perienced driver, who has driven in 
this locality for months. There, 
says he, "six dead men lay for 
nearly two weeks. It was danger
ous for anyone to try to go and
is the remains of that particular i 
car. There is a dead horse; it has 
been lying there on the roadside for. 
a week or more, soon it will burst.
Perhaps this will give you some 
little idea of our work out here. One 
feels that one is doing something. 
The American Ambulance, whose 
headquarters are at Paris, have hun
dreds of Ford cars on similar work, 
and, in addition, a large hospital in 
a school at. Neuilly, a suburb of 
Paris. So the U. S. A. is helping. 
France and England are giving their 
life-blood and their gold, and, if you 
see  an opportunity of helping, 
through the many societies now 
working, please do not miss it. The 
U. S. A. is making money out of 
tlie War, as well as giving money 
and service.
With greetings to the Alumni and 
my old friends of C. I. T.,
Yours very sincerely,

It is as the whole country had 
been a canvas swept by a huge 
brush with a coat of paint so dense 
that only here and there a little of 
the original paint shows through. 
This figurative brush has not been 
controlled by a single hand, but by 
a power bigger than anything the 
world has ever seen before. This 
one power is the power of com
mercial efficiency. Where uniformity 
in the infinitely smaller countries 
of Europe lias been due to the in
fluence of religion, of art, or of 
politics, the uniformity of the United 
States has been due to the wonder
ful organization of commercialism, 
which has been the dominating force 
in this country.
It is only to be expected that 
such a figurative brush, swept over 
the country by so' great a power, 
should have splashed over. The re

of Mexico and South America, of
