Hail and Farewell
ITH this we take our leave.
The year we spent In office .has been 
 an important one for uswe tried to make It 
an important one for Carnegie. Our primary 
sk, recording the history of Carnegie aB It 
was being made, we supplemented with.what 
we considered' a progressive, liberal editorial 
policy. The Tartan was a students newspa
per and it was incumbent that all its Influence 
end powerIf the power of the press can be 
; considered ot any Importancebe eierted as 
fully as possible toward benefiting: the stu' dent body. ' That was the ultimate objective 
'in everytiiing that was done or expressed.
Inthe/ broadest 9efise:- oure was -chiefly a 
task of revamping attitudes toward a liberal 
: pnt of 'view. Contending that eyer chang
ing conditions' throughout the world 89 well 
ae on tiiie campus, called for constant revi
sions in the setup, we were-consequently exit* 
ical. ' We did not intend. to Insinuate that. 
; when something was. advocated, it was be.'.cahse things were altogether hadbut rather 
that they could be. made better.
, s Setting always an idealSituation as a goal 
'we^strove*'(or it; oftbn, with the realization 
, that the ideal was unattainable but that the, 
'/'slt^yjng for -lt./wouldmake for progress.
:, .;>Many .things were, advocated, in; our platfortn. and'throughout the yearthe ^hortspan
 of one year allowing us only sufficient'-time to- toci, briefly.vupori cach. SmfugnesS, we conr sldered a .vice, particularly In.government and.
  -dminietrUcm. and wher wefound It we 
trld ;|q dioel it
---By choice, we were a prodding elementbej ' cause. that Is what, we. believe a - newspaper 
should-be. Our - creed was something like 
this: " V,
' .' -^Things may .be goodthey can always be' 
.tottef and -the best, is <not good .enough,. That-. 
: rye.'bellev^that', we: consider the job oan
 :editorlal stand.: '5 ' 
' -:.: Recommendations .to the new .staff , we omit 
-i.-rbrnrr rather the . only: recommendation, .we 
-could leave with them is whatbas been ex-.
; eiriplifted by oiir' attitude this year. Their 
tasTcis.a difflcuit one-and an jmmenseiy impottant , one : But they ;vwill. find It, on .the.
 '^whole, a glorious adventure, pgS we. and past 
^staffs before us did.

^Spring Carnival conies niosi opportunely as a' 
welcome and necessary respite before the long,,

- Being so comparatively young a school. Car

 - tradition. The annual carnival.  however, is 
v well on its. way: toward becoming, traditional 
: ahd' 'includes on Its program a number of 
'events which are more or less customarythe 
coronation of the campus queen, call-day cere

;-These events-remain valuable as tradition
- only insofar as they preserve the spirit of fun 
Which rules the carnival. Tradition must he

'3-t Caruegle can enter whole-lieavtediy into the

Y'&onual carnlval becomes perfunctory and is

. gy Robert R. French' 
" In the early spring 6M917 a German cor
poral and a: British lieutenant ley-directly op
posite one another In trenches on tbe petrified' 
battlefield of Ypres. Eighteen years later cor
poral and lieutenant faced each other across 
dJplowatlc tables io Berlin: Hitler, dictator of 
60,000,000. Germans, and Captain Anthony 
Eden, British Lord Privy Seal.
Throwing over the Treaty of Versailles with 
a proclamation. Hitler bad ' ordered military 
conscription and demanded economic union 
with Austria, Inclusion in the Reich of Qerman-speaking areas of Czecho-Slovakla, an afr 
force equal to Britain and France, an army 
to cope with Russia's and a navy of 400,000 
tons.
Such was the ultimatum presented to Sir 
John Simon, barrister and British Foreign 
Secretary, and his aide the At. Hon. Robert 
Anthouy Eden. They had flown from London 
to Berlin in an-attempt to pacify-the 'lader 
of a nation, conscious of its re-awakened pow
ers and its pride smarting under fifteen years 
of humiliation. European peace and disarma
ment had ended in a pitiful expose of armed 
hatred and bitterness; and what Europe had' 
feared since the Treaty was a reality.
Tlmt the scholarly Sir John' Simon should 
be accompanied by Eden was no surprise to 
diplomats who have spent the past few years 
at Geneva. At the League he was looked upon 
*6 the spokesman for Great Britain, because 
of Sir Johns growing skepticism toward--tbe 
League anddisarmament.
As Lord Privy Seal in the Foreign Office, he 
is the opposite of his superior In background, 
talents and environment. Sir John was al
ready a man of soqie years when the World 
War - broke upon Europe, and events since 
have made his lawyer^ logic tbe more pene
trating and concise, bis mind the more com* 
pleic and sophisticated, but left his diplomacy 
as blunt aB ever. s
Eden's generation is tbe lost generation 
of the War. By 1515 his eldest brother.had 
been klUed in action; his second, the present 
baronet and eighth in line, was a prisoner; ho, 
himself, wab Just leaving Eton; and the<fourth, 
a. child almost, was to be hilled at sea, Prom 
Eton, where he had been a prize linguist, he 
joined the Kings Royal Rifle Corps, in 1915. 
At nineteen he was the youngest adjutant in 
the British Army and the youngst brigade 
major before he was twenty-one. 
More fortunate than most of his fellows at 
Eton, the Ypres salient), the.- graveyard...of. 
youth, gave him a Military Cross. Thus while 
men. now near three score and ten, who 
watched the unrolling of the World War from 
business or government offices; are stolidly 
cynical about disarmament and -peace by way 
of Geneva, dnsea the: League as the Jast > 
and only st&iv. Seventeen years old wlien 
the War: began-and[ only .thirty-eight now, he 
has 'experienced in action -the disillusionment 
and horrr of the greatest of - modern  wars, 
and Geneva to him is more than the dream of 
 tired; haggard] ' broken WoWdrow Wilson.
-Returning from the-War , he' went, to Christ 
Church, Oxford, studied the :Near Eost He 
became  expert in its languages,' traveled 
through its countries in vacations -and--.wrote; 
 dliglilful book, Places In The. Sjin, about 
his Journeys. In 1922', when he came from Oxford. h was defeated''in bis home constitu
ency, Durham; by the Socialist candidat. ; But
year lhter he invaded Warwickshire,' the 
constituency of his aunt, the.dowager-Countess 
of'Warwick; detected her, later married her 
step-daughter, Beatrice Helln, and has been 
M; P. for this seat ever since. '
After three years learning the ropes in the 
Hoiise, he took a private secretaryship-in the 
Foreign Office/ He was appointed parliamen
tary private secretary to Sir usteii Chamberlain ii\ 1926,"lost his-position when the Tory 
government went out in 1929.J But-lie'returned with the National Government (Tory) in 1931 as parliamentary under-secretary in the Foreign Office, both positions held only Ly M. p.'s,;
He has consistently championed .the tenents of the-Locarno Pact, accomplished in the office, of Sir Austn. Chamberlain, ac'ahist the older Tory trpupe. But that he is a Tory himself he would be the last to denyEven - though he received hia share of -gentlemanly kicks-, he is a born* aristocrat with the pridenul.v, wealth and tradition behind him. A descendant of Lord Baltimore, always freshly.

. With the passing of examinations, undoubtedly many students are asking themselves if their time spent at night school is worthwhile. The night group usually needs some incentive, some'evidence to: ' support their original belief that pight school will at some time or other be worth something to them.
