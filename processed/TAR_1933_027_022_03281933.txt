Offers Interpretation 
Of Council Action
Owing to the interpretation 
of last week's Tartan concern
ing a change in Student Coun
cils constitution, I wish to 
make a correction.
There is no change to be 
made in the Councils constitu
tion. The Arts Ball has been 
reinstated under Council as a 
regular social event and not 
under the Senate. The matter 
of the dance being a closed af
fair has been granted. The 
matter of complimentary tickets 
for Arts Ball will be recom
mended to next years Council 
to rest in the hands of Arts 
Senate, the list to be approved 
by Student Council.
The letter from Mr. Dietz 
concerning the matter of prece
dence with the complimentary 
tickets was correct as far as it 
went, but the preceding conver
sation would have shown a dif
ferent light on the matter. 
Sincerely yours for the Council, 
JOSEF L. LENTZ, 
President.

Of First Semester 
Enrollment
One hundred and ninety-one students carrying a semester schedule 
of 48 or more units received ail 
average grade of B or above (fac
tor of 5.0 or above) and have been 
cited on the Carnegie Honor List 
for the first semester 1932-33, Alan 
Bright, Registrar, has announced.

F. B. Stitt Awarded 
Chem. Scholarship
Fred B. Stitt '32, of the Depart
ment of Chemistry, has been 
awarded an assistantship in. chem
istry at the California Institute of 
Technology for the year 1933-34.
Mr. Stitt received the degree of 
bachelor of science in chemical 
engineering at Carnegie in 1932, 
and is at present studying for a 
masters degree here. Under the 
guidance of Dr. Warner, he is now 
investigating salt and solvent me
dium effects in the conversion of 
ammonium cyanate into urea.
At the California Institute of Tech
nology he will have an opportunity 
to conduct research in physical 
chemistry or molecular structure 
as partial fulfillment of the re
quirements for the doctors degree.
Mr. Stitt is the second graduate 
from the Department of Chemistry 
at Carnegie to continue study at 
the California Institute of Technol
ogy. Robert S. Barton 29, who re
ceived a bachelors and masters 
degree at Carnegie, was the first 
to obtain such an assistantship and 
will probably receive his doctors 
degree this June.
Engineering Lab. Gets 
New Poiver Drives
A power transmission experi
ment, illustrating the more modern 
methods of power drives, has re
cently been placed in the Mechani
cal Engineering Laboratory. The 
drives chosen are the Link Belt, 
Silent Chain, the Reeves Variable 
Speed Reducer, and the mutiple 
V belt. In the present set-up, 
four different methods of measur
ing or absorbing power are demon
strated, namely, a calibrated .elec
tric motor with an unusually wide 
speed variation, an Amsler Torsion 
Dynameter with a strobscopic de
vice, a Karapetoff Torsional Con
tact Dynameter with electric con
tactors, and a Prony brake.
With different pieces of appa
ratus running at different speeds 
it is necessary to measure several 
speeds simultaneously. This is 
solved by the use of three special 
speed counters designed and built 
in the Department of Mechanical 
Engineering.
The student working on this ex
periment is thus enabled to study 
the operation of the above men
tioned power transmission devices 
and at the same time familiarize 
himself with equipment, designed 
to measure power.
Drama Dept. 
Will Present 
English Plays
The Farmers Wife 
Written by Eden 
Phillpotts 
MATINEE GIVEN FOR 
PUBLIC ON FRIDAY
Performances Will Begin 
Tomorrow Evening, 
Continue to Apr. 4
Beginning tomorrow evening in 
the Little Theater, the Department 
of Drama will present The Farm
ers Wife, a play by Eden Phill
potts, English novelist and play
wright. The performances will 
continue through Tuesday niglu 
with the exception of Friday 
evening when the Glee Club Con
cert will be given in the Little The
ater. The matinee on Friday 1& 
open to the public with no tickets 
required for admittance. The play 
will be under the direction of E. W. 
Hickman, a member of the faculty 
in the Department of Drama.
The Farmers Wife is an 
English comedy of Devonshire life. 
Before opening in America, where 
it was presented by Charles Coburn 
in New York, it was one of the 
long run successes in London. The 
story revolves around - the affairs 
of Samuel Sweetland, a Devonshire 
farmer, who lias been a widower 
for two years and decides to marry 
again. He dictates to Araminta 
Dench, his housekeeper, a. list of 
the ladies to whom in turn he con
templates offering himself. The 
first is Louisa Windeatt, a middleaged widow, with a bit of land ad
joining bis own. If she refuses 
him, he will next address himself 
to Thirza Tapper, an elderly 
spinster devoted to good works. 
Should she also refuse him he will 
give the plump and rosy, village 
postmistress a chance, and as a 
last resort he will try his luck with 
a lady who runs a hotel at Dawlish. 
In spite of these carefully laid 
plans, Farmer,. Sweetland finds 
Theres many a slip twixt the cup 
and the lip before the situation 
falls into a semblance of smooth
ness.
The value of the play lies in the 
admirable local characterization, 
the terseness and quaintness of the 
Devonshire speclir
The large cast assigned to The 
Farmers Wife includes: Emanuel 
Breakstone and John Dawson in 
the part of the lovelorn farmer; 
Dorothy Neumann and Henrietta 
Siskin as his housekeeper; and 
Marjorie Eshelman, Henriette 
Weiler, Audrey Kelley, Polly 
RowHes, Mary Ann Miller,, Jane 
Witmer, Fern Ball, and Ruth Hornbeck among the feminine leads.
Green Pastures 
Star Will Speak 
In Little Theater
Richard B. Harrison, who plays 
the role of the Lord in The Green 
Pastures will speak in the Little 
Theater Thursday at 4:30. Several 
singers from the company will also 
be present; they will sing selec
tions from the drama.
The play, which opened yester
day in the Nixon Theater, was writ
ten by Marc Connelly, a former 
Pittsburgher who was awarded the 
Pulitzer Prize in drama for 1931- 
32.
Mr. Harrison has. been with the 
play since it was first produced on 
February 24, 1930, and in the con
tinuous run of three years that the 
production has had, he has not 
misssd a single performance. Dur
ing this time he has toured the en
tire country, speaking at colleges 
and universities and delivering 
sermons in churches.
The play. is. a folk drama, one 
of the most beautiful of produc
tions in recent years, and Mr. Har
rison in his role of the Lord ren
ders an impressive interpretation. 
His performance is so natural that 
his own character shines through, 
and the part as he portrays it has 
the patriarchal equality of the 
Bible.
By special arrangements, Carne
gie students may secure tickets for 
next week's performance at un
usually reduced rates, orchestra 
seats being sold at $1.20. This ex
ceptionally low price should en
courage as many students as possi
ble to attend this unique produc
tion. Tickets may be purchased in 
room 104, College of Fine Arts.

Merriman, Water 
Supply Engineer, 
Speaks Thursday
Thaddeus Merriman, chief en
gineer on the Board of Water Sup-, 
ply of New York City, will lecture 
in the Union at 8:30 p. m., Thurs
day evening. The topic of his lec
ture will be The Colorado River 
Aqueduct of the Metropolitan 
Water District.
Mr. Merriman Jias had wide ex
perience as an engineer. He was 
assistant engineer for the New 
Britain, Connecticut Water Works 
until 1897, after which time he 
served for two years on sjftrveys 
on the United States Nicaragua 
Commission. From 1899 to. 1900 
he was chief of the survey party 
on the United States Isthmian 
Canal Commission, and until 1901 
was affiliated with the Continental 
Jewell Filtration Company of New 
York.
Mr. Merriman . was with the 
Board of Water Supply for New 
York until 1905, serving on surveys, 
plans, designs, and construction. 
Since that time he has held various 
positions with the Catskill Water 
Supply System, being successively, 
assistant engineer, assistant to the 
chief engineer, deputy chief en
gineer, and since 1922, chief en
gineer. He is at present employed 
on a project for securing a water 
supply from the Delaware River.
To transfer $5,000,000,000 of our 
national income from the non
farming elements of our population 
to the farmersthat is. the prob
lem of adequate farm relief.
The president has set himself to 
correct forces that have been run
ning adrift since before the. Civil 
War. To date, no major party or 
President lias ever squarely met or 
completely mastered them.
Those Hvlio doubt that the farm
ers can be led into the promised 
land state the difficulties of the 
problem as follows. The over
grown stature of American agricul
ture had its beginning in the abol
ition of the English tariff on im
ports of grain before the Civil 
War.
This gave our farmers an ex
panding market in the industrial 
population of England and later 
there came a still larger market 
when Continental countries devel
oped factory industries. At the 
same time, our exports of farm pro
ducts gave us borrowing power.
The members of the Delta Upsilon team which placed second in 
the sing are as follows: Norman L. 
Brown, director; Phillips G. Auten, 
Carl A. Boehme, William H. Councill, Wilson L. Dornaus, William 
W. Gilbert, Louis 'Karges, William
C. Lafcarus, Rodger D. Middlekauff, 
John Richmond, William E. Sliann, 
Edwin H. Trapp, Carl W. Wirsliing.
Ten teams were entered in the

previous years, will render a con

ite dates for these engagements 
have no.t been scheduled.
The flow of European capital to our 
shores developed our own heavy 
industries. In turn the growth of 
our factory population still further 
increased the demand for American 
farm products. These things plus 
the cheap land policy or the gov
ernment made for giantism in 
American agriculture.
But at the same time adverse 
forces were at work. Agricultural 
lands in Australia, Canada, Argen
tine and South Africa came into 
production. Their low value which 
meant low taxes, low rents and 
small volume of interest payments 
per acre made for lew cost produc
tion.
This situation contrasted with 
that in the United States where 
land values skyrocketed during 
the period of western expansion. 
Values rose and floated upon hope 
rather than upon income. Enormous 
volumes of debt, interest payments, 
and taxes upon expensive land

Cambridge Honors 
Thomas Lippert
Thomas Lippert, who took his 
masters degree in Physics here 
last June and who has been con
tinuing his work In the laboratory 
of Dr. Emerson Pugh of the 
Physics Department, lias been In
vited by Lord Rutherford of Cam
bridge University to carry 011 his 
work during 1933-34 in the Caven
dish Laboratories.
Mr. Lippert has investigated the 
new magnetic material discovered 
in the Bell Laboratories and named 
by them Permalloy. This alloy 
possesses extraordinary magnetic 
properties. When properly heattreated it has so high a magnetic 
permeability that it is magnetically 
saturated in very weak fields.
Dr. Pugli and Mr. Lippert have 
experimented for months with a 
heavy bar of permalloy carrying 
large currents from a special stor
age battery. The circular field 
within the rod, produced by the 
current in the straight bar itself, 
produces thermal and thermo-elec
tric effects which are reversible 
with the current. These effects 
are not recorded in the literature 
of Physics and additional experi
ments are being carried on to give 
further evidence as to the nature 
of the phenomena.

Change in Distribution 
Of Quality Points 
Being Planned 
D WILL BE LOWEST 
PASSING LETTER
Dropping of E Suggested 
Originally by College of 
Engineering Group
At a meeting held last week, the 
Educational Senate decided by a 
unanimous vote, to abolish E, the 
lowest passing mark from.the grad
ing system at Carnegie. This de
cision will go into effect in Septem
ber when only the grades, A. B. C.
D. F. R. and I will be used. D will 
be the lowest passing grade. A re
arrangementin the distribution of 
quality points is now being plan
ned  by the Senate.
According to.a member of the 
Educationual Senate, one of the 
reasons for the change was that 
Carnegies grading system present
ed a false impression to outsiders 
whose conoeptlon of the average 
college mark is a C. Abolishing 
the E will raise the letter grades 
and bring Carnegies marking sys
tem in line with that used by other 
colleges.
The dropping of the E from the? 
marking system has been a subject 
of discussion among faculty groups 
ifor the past two years. A commit
tee in the College of Engineering 
took the first steps in the action 
that was later carried 011 by the 
Educational Senate.
The Senate Committee on Exam
inations and the Marking Systom 
which presented the rccommondations for the abolition of the E is 
composed of Professors Gustafson, 
chairman; Crauna, Estep, Readlo, 
and Rosenbach.

Druids Reorganize 
As Local Society
Student Council has approved 
the petition of the Druid Society 
to reorganize as a local organiza
tion under the name of Sclmlter. 
The duties and privileges of this 
group will ho the same as those of 
the former Druids, except that it 
will be a local society rather than 
a national honorary. The present 
group is composed of the men who 
were called for Druids on Call Day 
during the Spring Carnival last 
year.
New members will be selected 
as usual on the basis of scholar
ship, character, and extra-curricu
lar activities. It will be the duty 
of Scimiter as it was that of the 
DruidB, to enforce freshman regu
lations and take charge of the an
nual Sophomore Hop. Meetings 
are held at intervals at the various 
fraternity houses on the campus.

Schedule For 
Track Season 
Is Announced
AT AN INFORMAL IMPROMPTU DINNER given laot week by Dcr 
Maxlo and Mra. Hannum in honor of the basketball team, Louie Jagnow 
was elected captain of next year's quintet. Jagnow should make a 
very capable leader, having had two years of varsity experience and 
ever so many more before coming hero. Jagnow played exceptionally 
good ball In his freshman year and laot year, but this year being ham
pered by a knee Injury he was unable to play his best game. A good 
rest from now until next season sh'ould' bring the injured limb back to 
normal; so we look for the stellar forward to have a banner year in 
1934.* *. + * *
THERE WAS ANOTHER SIDELIGHT to that dinner, and If at any. 
time, you have a desire to get thrown out of the gym just mention 
bridge to either AI Irwin or'OVXax Hannum. Jt seems as II! Al and Max 
had been talking about their game In no too modest terms. lii fact 
they kindly offered to eoMjh any of the Jnferiraternlty bridge teams, 
Well, after finishing the big meal and lighting up their cigars l.liey 
gave out a challenge to any of the basketballers. Up stepped big Ed 
Stentz and "Stumpy Fergus, to accept the challenge. Ed is a pretty 
fair player and Fergus has piayed maybe once or twice. As the cards 
were being dealt, a series of chuckles was heard, and a remark which 
sounded something like "it's as easy as taking candy from a baby." AL 
the end of an hour or two of playing, the challengers had perhaps 200 
points. The warning to be derived from this is: Stay away from the
gym."
THE BASKETBALL TEAM obliged me by naming an All-Opponent 
team which I promised I would present to you if I got it. By looking 
over the two combinations named, I would hate to try to pick a team 
that would beat them. It is interesting to note that the pride of Cleve
land, Eddie Finnegan, received a place on the second team. Well, the 
boys should know. However, here it is, and if you dont like these 
choices put your own down in their place:

WITH INTERFRATERNITY WRESTLING HAVING JUST STARTED

a few cases whore the unlucky athlete looks longingly at a piece of 
pie, hut is forced to leave the table by his cup snatching brothers. 
Yes, scales don't lie so the waistline must be reduced. The wrestling 
schedule appears In another, column of this page; Pi it would be wise 
to notice it closely in order that all entrants appear at the proper 
time. The schedule for the preliminary heats of the swimming meet 
also appear in another column of this paper. The schedule is listed 
exactly as the drawings were mado.*****
WE UNKNOWINGLY LEFT OUT OF THIS COLUMN LAST WEEK 
an Item of Importance t.o the swimming team and the rest of the stu
dents as well. Frank La Chance was elected captain of next year's 
tank squad. Frank has been a mainstay of the relay team for the past 
two years as well as coislstent man in the longer free-style races. 
Congratulations, Frank!
Ranny Boyer, star backstroker for the Tartan swimmers for the 
past two years, added a new record to his fast growing list. Ranny 
swam three-quarters of a mile which is something like forty-eight laps 
of the pool in 20 minutes 47.4 seconds. This is a new world's record 
for that event.

With the first track meet less 
than a month away, Coaxdi Guy 
Halferty Is still a bit undecided 
whether to have sklls or spikes put 
on the. track shoes. Perhaps it 
would be better to wait until next 
weeks April Fool issue to an
nounce the cinder schedule, but ac
cording to the calendar, spring Is 
here and that means track.
Tile season opens on April 22 
with the perennial practice meet 
with tiie Pittsburgh Athletic Asso
ciation. The P. A. A. team is com
posed largely of former ciollege 
stars, many of whom were wearers 
of the Plaid and although. Carnegie 
usually wins till meet, it proves 
an ideal warm-up contest and aids 
greatly In selecting the team for 
the coming campaign.
Reserve Seeks Revenge 
The following week Western Re
serve conies down from Cleveland 
seeking revenge for the 91-49 lac
ing that tlie Tartans handed them 
last year in their own back yard. 
Athletics at the Cleveland Institu
tion are decidedly on the up swing 
as the basketball and football 
scores with Carnegie show, so it 
would not be surprising to see the 
Red Cats provide a very stiff open
er ifor the official collegiate season, 
On May 6 the Skibos hop down 
to Little Washington to engage 
W. & J. The Presidents have nev
er given Carnegie much trouble in 
track and will have to work hard 
to keep last years 97L27 score 
from being even larger. The week 
after the W. & J. meet, Geneva 
College appears In the Bowl and 
that is a decidedly different story. 
'Geneva always has one of the best 
college teams In this district and 
in the past few years have kept 
tho Tartans on the run. Last 
spring at Beaver Falls tho Coven
antors broke Carnegie's four-meet 
winning string to the tune of 88-46 
and are just as anxious as ever to 
Increase that margin.
Meet Pitt on May 16 
On May 16, the Tuesday after 
the Geneva contest, the Plaid meets 
an old rival, Pitt. The Panthers 
supremacy in track and field dates 
back many years and nothing 
would lend to a successful season 
like a victory over Pitt. Last year 
the Pittites were numerically, 
rather than individually stronger 
than Carnegie although this year 
in the Indoor season under their 
new Mentor Olsen, the individual 
performers have shown up very 
favorably.
The last two meets o:li the season 
with Temple and Grove City, are 
both away. Carnoglo Is especially 
anxious to make up for tho 79-56 
setback which t.ho Owls inflicted 
last spring and will journey to Phil 
adolphla with that as an ultimat
um. Grove City was easily defeat
ed last season and Should prove no 
difficult hurdle this year either

Nators Elect 
LaChance Next 
Years Captain
, Phe 1932-33 swimming season' 
closed officially last Monday night 
with a meeting at the home of 
Coach Risodorph. At this meeting 
Frank LaChance, varsity freestylerV 
was elected to the captaincy of 
next years team. Warren Ailes 
was chosen to succeed Charles 
Applegate in the position of var
sity manager, while Herman Miller 
was awarded tho freshman berth. 
Varsity letters in this sport were 
awarded to Norman Franlto, retir
ing captain; Frank LaChance, captaln-olect; Randall Boyer, back
stroke record breakor.; Palmer 
Miller, stellar froestyler; Ira Kuhn, 
varsity diver; and Julian vonderLanckon, veteran broaststrokor.
The season was a peculiar one 
showing an unfavorable balance of 
wins In spite of tho fact that tho 
Tech nators scored more firsts 
than their combined opponents. 
The varsity mermen succeeded in 
vanquishing Case and Western Re
serve, but suffered defeat at the, 
hands of Pitt, Franklin and Mar-1 
shall, and N. Y. U. The majority 
of the meets were closely con
tested, the Tech men losing out 
from lack of seconds and thirds 
rather than insufficient firsts.' The 
high scorer for the season was 
Palmer Miller with nine individual 
firsts to his credit. Randall Boyer 
gave excellent exhibitions in break
ing the pool record for the 150- 
yard backstroke in 1:47 and lower
ing the three-quarter mile back
stroke world record to 20:47.2. 
Miller also broke the pool records 
for the fifty and hundred freestyle 
event in the fast times of 24 sec
onds and 56.5 seconds respectively. 
The relay .team of Franke, La
Chance, vonder Lanken, and Miller 
negotiated the 200-jfard distance in 
1:44, the fastest time ever done by 
a Carnegie team in this event.
The freshman swimmers did well 
in their campaign, defeating Sclienley Hi, tying Langley Hi, though 
losing to Allderdice and Turtle 
Creek. Freshman numerals were

BETAS DRAW PLACE 
IN FINAL CONTEST
Basket Ball Is Replaced By 
Mush Ball As Spring 
-Shows On Calendar
The winner of last nights game 
will meet in the play off for the 
Intramural Basketball League to
morrow night against the Betas. 
The Betas drew a bye in drawing 
for the games which only necessi
tates their playing the one game. 
The Kappa Sigs and the Alpha 
Sigs were the teams that met last 
night. The winner of the final re
ceives a large cup and the other 
two winners of the leagues get 
smaller cups.
The final standings of the teams 
appear below and they remained 
little changed by last weeks 
games. The two games that could 
have tripped the leaders produced 
no surprises as the Betas easily 
won from the Lambda Chis and 
Welch forfeited to Kappa Sigma.
The whole season has been'quite 
a success due in one way to the ex
cellent .-officiating of the games. 
The officials have called the plays 
quite well keeping in mind the in
experience of the players and not 
delaying the games with unneces
sary fouls.

Large Squad to Greet 
INew Chief, Howard 
Harpsler, Apr. 10
After a two-year layoff from 
spring football practice and a coin
cidental two years of disastrous 
campaigning, Carnegie Tech's new 
board of strategy has decided to 
return to its old custom this spring. 
A better execution and knowledge 
of fundamentals is being aimed at.
Howard I-Iarpster, new Tartan 
mentor, is planning to begin opera
tions 011 April 10, beginning with 
which date the old horse linament 
will be quite prevalent in the vi
cinity of the field house. Actual 
practice begins after Easter vaca
tion.
There will be 110 bed of roses 
waiting for the new boss, either, 
for he will be faced with replacing 
some big gaps in the ranks. The 
two finest performers on the squad, 
Co-captains Hooks Sample and 
Georgie Kavel, have played their 
last game in a Carnegie uniform, 
and many other fine players have 
been lost either through gradua
tion or ineligibility.
Among those lost through gradu
ation are Melvin Jones, who played 
a fine game at center all year, Stu 
Dueger, first string quarterback, 
and Harry McCurdy, another fine 
quarterback. Jack Croissant, big 
tackle, Curly Siegal, sub center, 
and Tony Ostrosky, pass receiver 
deluxe, have also played out their 
string. Plummer and Tesser, two 
varsity mainstays, have been given 
the gate due to unsatisfactory 
grades.
There will be a Tew boys from 
this years' freshman squad to 
swell the numbers, but the plebes 
were not as big or as numerous as 
usual.
From all indications I-Iarpster 
will be forced to base his attack 
principally on speed and deception, 
for he has plenty of that but has 
little bulk. Joe Milim and Jerry 
OToole seem to be the omy backfield candidates with any amount 
of well applied beef, and Mr. 
OToole has never been classed as 
a giant. Spisak, Carlson, Bevevino, 
Bouser, and Sayles are all the fast, 
broken-field type of backs.
In the line, the ends will be 
taken care of by Messrs. Stewart, 
Goodridge, Burns, and Lewis, while 
the tackle berths will be filled by 
Forsman, Nutter, Dolloway, and 
Croft. The guard assignments 
will find Heinzer, Dreshar, Burzio, 
and Anderson all looking for trou
ble. The loss of Jones and Siegal 
may be made up for by the return 
to school of Lew Moscrip, star 
freshman center of two years ago 
who had some difficulty with the 
scholarship committee. He is not 
in school this semester, but he may 
attend summer school.

In Rifle Match
. The University of Pittsburgh has 
extended an invitation to the Car
negie Swimming Team to compete 
in the coming Eastern Intercolle
giate Matches. Mitzie Gray has 
scheduled, the races to be run off 
during the week, of April second 
because all results must bo en
tered by April tenth. Back crawl, 
front crawl, iireast stroke and 
hundred yard free-style are the 
only matches in which Carnogio 
will compete, and practices will be 
held for them all this week. 
Swarthmore, Dry M,awr and West 
Virginia University are among 
some of the schools who have al
ready entered, and were depending 
on Carnegie to make as splendid a 
record as they did last year.
The past week was a lucky one 
for the Womens Rifle telim. Leah 
Voegtley, Alda Waina and Ruth 
Sclimelz all shot perfect scores. 
The occasion was a match shot 
against the University of Califor
nia. University of Missouri, Cornell 
and Massachusetts. In a separate 
match against Rhode Island State 
College the Carnegieit.es managed 
to roll up a score of 496, which 
doesnt leave much room for the 
Islanders to beat us.
Volleyball practices, continue as 
usual every.day in the gym. There 
are several teams which have been
making snappy showings, so we 
are expecting a good tournament. 
If we could find Sylvia Waide we 
might be able to tell you more 
about it but Sylvia is as elusive as 
her name. Maybe this will bring 
Tier around.
Every place we go either a blue 
or an orange sign, announcing tlie 
Swimming Party to be held this 
Saturday night, greets our eyes. 
Its bound to be a success!!! So 
get your tickets now from Mitzie 
Gray or any member of the W. A. 
A. Board because there are only a 
limited number of them allowed to 
bo sold.
There have been twenty 100 
points" awarded to the members of 
the Basketball teams whose sea
son has just closed. That makes 
quite a few more than last year, 
which proves that the freshmen 
are better than ever and those 
Sophomores are as good as they'll 
ever be. As to who won the cham
pionshipit would take Solomon 
himself to decide. But well award 
it. to the Sophomores because we're 
afraid of what they mignc uo if we 
didnt. . It wouldnt have been fair 
to let the first team of the Sophs 
play the second team of the Freshies because the results might have 
been too shocking for a poor col
umnist to print. See you all at 
the SWIM!!!
Leah Voegtly, captain of the 
womens rifle team, placed seventh 
in the Womens National Intercol
legiate Championship Rifle Match 
recently, making a score of 592 out 
of a possible 600.
This years-rifle team has en
joyed great, success, winning seven
teen of the twenty-two. matches 
played. Last Friday the team 
broke all previous Carnegie records 
in a match against four universi
ties, making a score of 498 out of 
a possible 500. The match was a 
postal match played against the 
University of Missouri, Penn State, 
Cornell, and the University of Cal
ifornia. The scoring of the Car
negie women for the match was:
Voegtly ............................................ 100

take form. Instead of being the 
battle , of the century to find out 
-what the popular songs are it will 
shape itself into acontest to find 
out whether the wets are dry, or 
the drys are wet.
Of course, as far as I am concerned, it doesn't matter whether 
the country was wet the past twelve 
years since the noble experiment 
went into effect. I am concerned 
though in finding'out how dry the 
country really was, not in exterior 
appearances, but from the inside 
out. I have heard it said by a per
son whom one would think was an 
oracle on such subjects as propriety, 
sobriety, piety, and the rest of the 
ieties, that the country needed 
such safeguards as those offered 
by the ban on hard cider, soft 
drinks, and the like, but this same 
individual was conspicuous by the 
number of times his indulgence in 
the soft drinks tcok him from the 
hard and straight path of sobriety. 
Of course the prohibiting of such 
drinks was for everybody but him, 
he knew how to use the stuff cor
rectly, certainly.

At last we see a way out of the 
depression. All we need is some 
back numbers of this paper, and a 
contract, and we can all become 
magicians. The cigarette com
pany that runs those tricky ads ex
posing famous tricks of infamous 
magicians has given us the key to 
success.
Of course, you'll say that there 
will be too many magicians, and 
besides, you cant grow a 
moustache. If youre any kind of 
a magician at all, youll fake all 
the other magicians out of a job, 
and get the contract yourself. 
Otherwise, form a union, and be 
appointed (more skullduggery) 
walking delegate of the' Associated 
Magicians Amalgamated, Local 
Number Three, and youll have 
nothing to worry.about, unless the 
brothers pull some fast magic on 
the treasuiT.
Youve probably decided by this 
time that if you were a magician 
(youd have to be!) .youd have the 
kind of joy you are studying to 
fill. Well, if youd rather keep 
company with machinery, etc., in
stead of a couple of assistants 
such as are shown in the ads, 
there is no hope for you, and you 
shouldnt have read this article. 
Maybe we should have warned you. 
At any rate, weve written it into 
our contract that we decidedly 
wont show our bag of tricks in. any 
Pittsburgh theater. Too many 
people know us!
Spring Songs 
Stirs Simple 
Scriblers Soul
Strange how we mortals look at 
things. Some are prone to pre
scribe the correct line of procedure 
to be followed when it comes to 
ones habits and what one should 
do as far as satisfying appetite 
is concerned, and when I mention 
appetites, I include beverages, be
cause these form a necessary part 
of ones diet. Where would we 
be without our daily cup of coffee 
for instance? Well, at any <rate, 
the country must be saved at all 
costs and the only way to do it is 
to make some rule or regulation 
which will stop the flow ofthe gold
en stuff. A prohibiting measure is 
adopted and the country is made 
bone dry and democracy is saved 
to future generations for all times. 
It. doesnlt matter whether yours 
truly wants to drink or not, my 
neighbor says not, and poor mo, 
well T guess I'll have to suffer for 
his likes and dislikes. And then, 
we were all told sometime ago in 
our early school life that we are 
free people.
The pen is mightier than the 
sword, an oid adage, but a true one. 
Despite the number of casualties 
which have followed in the wake of 
the noble experiment and the en
forcement thereof, it has not been 
possible to persuade the people as 
a whole that the experiment was 
as noble as it was intended to be, 
in fact, sometimes it was ignoble 
to say the least. How many uptrodden individuals have been 
forced to quaff from the dregs of 
poorly prepared beverages when 
they could just as easily have par
taken of the whosesome stuff will 
never be khown. The light brown 
October Ale of De Koven fame was 
a memory, but a pleasant one at 
that. Now it will be changed, so 
again I emphasize the importance 
of the pen.
Thus, with one stroke, all the 
past is wiped out and'we will be 
able to start anew.. Well have our 
beer again,, not because the.'minor
ity of the. country wants it but be
cause the minority doesnt want it. 
Sounds funny to put it that way 
doesnt it, paradoxical, but never
theless true. The quaff that hits the 
spot on a warm day will soon be 
dispensed from emporiums estab
lished., for the purpose. The , tea 
parties of the past will be beer par
ties of the future and the public 
will not be one bit worse off, all 
admonitions to the contrary.
A new caution promulgated by the 
hard to dies is to the effect that one 
should not partake of the vile stuff 
if one desires to keep his boyish 
figure. Beer is fattening and 
therefore the ATUS are abroad 
with their dope telling us what to 
do and what not to do if we wish 
to stay slick and slim. Candy is 
fattening also, wonder why some 
people dont start a prohibition 
against the sweets.
Springthat pleasant faced,
gayly bedecked . ladyhas once 
more invaded our midst. The signs 
are unmistakable, longer days, 
patches of greener grass, buds tim
idly pushing out and, of course, a 
young man|s fancy turning to 
thoughts of . . .
Springsthat glorious season
when dormant mother nature
shakes off her lethargic mood and 
sallies forth in brilliant hues. Her 
newest mood is contagious and 
everything about her is visibly 
affected'. The birds oiice more sing 
happy songs, flowers burst forth in 
resplendent hues, trees unfold in 
majestic splendor and a fragrance 
fills the air that stirs the hearts o 
mankind to newer and more pleas
ant thoughts.
Springwho can resist her in
fectious smile? Even the sun re
sponds with a warmer glow, all 
the world awakens and sings a 
song of thanksgiving. The 
shackles of a coldi dismal winter 
are broken. Happiness fills every
bodys heart and will not be denied 
its expression:
Springthat unknown thing that 
affects all humanity. People smile, 
laugh, and are gay. A burden 
seems to have been lifted from 
everybodys shoulders, even though 
it may have been only an overcoat. 
At any rate, spring is here and-with 
nature in her happiest mood we 
can assume a cheerful disposition 
and greet our; fellow man with a 
smile.
T echnocracy 
Talk Attracts 
Many Supporters
The coming lecture on the pros 
and cons of technocracy will proba
bly be well attended. ' Besides be
ing free, it is a matter of interest 
t.o manjr people, even though offi
cial support has been withdrawn 
from the movement.
Like everything else, the plan 
has its good points, but it would 
seem that in principle, all it can 
offer is to supplant an already bad 
bureaucracy with a worse oiie. It 
may be that views 011 the subject 
are prejudiced as are views on re
ligion. It may also be that most 
of the objectors feel that what was 
good enough for father is good 
enough for them.
Be that as it may, it is going to 
take a lot of hard work, fast talk
ing, and very good salesmanship 
to sell the idea to the thinking 
American public. The intelligensia 
who started the movement, and 
the lower classes who will jump at 
any new order of things without 
thinking are its chief supporters, 
The steadier middle classes seem 
to prefer repairing the wreck and 
checking the damage done to our 
economic system before scrapping 
it.
It is only logical to suppose that 
technocracy, like all other revolu
tionary schemes to provide a 
utopia, would fail in practice, not 
necessarily due to a faulty founda
tion but because men are as they 
always have been to a large extent 
beset by greed, jealousy, and false 
dealing. And, too, like the late 
Julius Caesar of history, most men 
are ambitious and would resent a 
system that would restrict their 
hours ,01 remunerative labor, even 
for the common good.
Socialism arid communism can
not successfully operate because 
the human race is not angelic or 
god-like in character, and it seems 
possible that technocracy will fall 
into destetude for the same rea
son. 
Change Schedule 
To Aid Student
With beer on its way, scheduled 
to arrive in a very short time, the 
nation should make an effort to 
bottle the prosperity which is sure 
to follow it. Think of all the wheels 
which are starting to turn, and the 
number of] men who will be put 
back to work making' kegs, coils, 
bottles, and the farmer, well I10 
should be setting pretty with his 
big supply of cereals ready to hop 
into the picture after twelve long 
years of lean sailing. Maybe we 
wont have to establish a new mora
torium 011 the crops to save the 
poor farmer after all. So now with 
beer in the offing, everybody 
should get read} for a bung-up 
time. Guess I better bottle up too 
before I get the high sign. So, so 
long until . . . That was the Idle 
Night Student signing off until this 
time next week. The Tartan bids* 
you all good night.

Once in a lifetime, the impecu
nious night student who had to salt 
away his car until the.: depression 
is over, is satisfied with the pres
ent street car service, although 
late in the evening this service is 
deplorable.
We cant expect special cars, but 
it seems only fair to expect reason
ably good service in return for the 
fare paid, which is high when com
pared to that in other cities.
It is true the management of the 
car company is deeply concerned 
with cutting costs all possible, but 
011 the other hand the passengers 
are concerned with getting home 
to their little trundle beds some
time before the cock crows.
If no extra cars can economical
ly be added to the skeleton sched
ule, perhaps it would be possible to 
have the timing of the runs ar
ranged so that the cars would ar
rive at Woodlawn or Morewood 
avenues sometime near the halfhour mark when, classes have been 
dismissed for a period of ten min
utes in order that the students 
might have the opportunity of ar
riving at the carline instead of 
having to wait from ten to twehtyfive minutes for cars.
European Situation 
Watched With Interest
Increasing tension throughout 
Europe is a cause of deep concern 
for diplomats and statesmen the 
worlfl over. Recent parleys have 
apparently eased the tension some
what, but there ' is still enough 
loose powder on the scene to pro
vide an upheaval if a spark should 
unfortunately enkindle it.
The East, too, while crowded off 
the front page by the return of 
beer, does not exactly resemble a 
peaceful scene. Manchukuoan 
troops have penetrated into North 
China proper, and some of the 
European powers are uneasily 
watching their large interests in 
this section.
Altogether, it would seem that 
the need for real diplomacy and 
real leaders was never more acute. 
Nationalism, the present cause of 
Germanys troubles, greed, dissat
isfaction, and heavy armaments 
are all playing their parts. The 
four grim horsemen are booted 
and spurred. Let us hope that 
their ride will be permanently 
postponed by the honest efforts of 
the men in power.
Contest Rules 
Announced In 
Champ Hunt
BigResponse Claiming
Honor Expected From 
Night Students
DIDJA NOTICE
THAT theyre looking for a 
champion, that is, a champion 
long distance traveler to night 
school. Well you can quit look
ing, for that honor is clinched 
and belongs to yours truly. 
However, well wait until every
body has put in his claim and 
then step up and grab it off.
THAT a heartless editor left 
off my famous parting shot last 
week, but Ill get even with him 
sometime by not handing in my 
weekly literary gem.
THAT a certain student in 
one of the labs said he spilled 
water on himself the other 
night when trying to explain 
why his clothes were wet. But 
the suspicion grows that he 
merely lost his control for the 
moment.
THAT spring has kub, dab it. 
Yes, yes, beautiful spring with 
its wet, sloppy, dirty streets 
and rainy weather,- but cheer up 
it will soon be over and then 
we will truly have beautiful 
spring.
THAT they shot the last 
night, graduate for the Thistle 
last week. If you missed get
ting your map surveyed you can 
only have it done by appoint
ment now. But who wants to 
get shot by appointment?
THAT all is quiet on the hol
iday front, except in Bunnyland 
. . . where egg laying records 
are being broken . . . new 
color schemes being selected 
. . . and an attack on the fam
ily exchequer planned ... to 
satisfy sister and brother, fath
er and mother. Oh, well! with 
things being what they are, I 
know one fellow that going to 
have to forget all about the big 
parade.
THAT unless you have helped 
in the Buy Carnegie plan you 
missed a swell chance to help a 
fellow student. Come on, think 
hard, theres surely some way 
you can give a fellow student a 
little work and thus enable him 
to earn some much needed cash. 
Believe you me, it makes one 
feel darn good to know that 
you are doing something worth 
while.
THAT once again we scoop 
the news with this choice mor
sel, unless were all wrong, you 
are going to get your annual 
shock next week, so be on the 
lookout for it.
THAT that's that and Ill be 
seenya.
I11 these columns last week the 
first announcement was made , of 
a contest being organized by the 
Plaid to find a champion. Last 
year a contest was held for the 
same purpose and the success was 
very gratifying. The purpose of 
the contest is to find out the niglit 
student who travels the greatest 
distance in order to attend Carne
gie at night, in other words, who 
j the champion long distance travel
ing night school students is.
There are 110 strings attached to 
this . contest, only a few simple 
rules. A number of students come 
from long distances in order to at
tend classes at Carnegie,, some 
even come from bordering statefe. 
It is a credit, certainly, to all 
those students who give up a num
ber of hours of their leisure time 
in order to attend night school, but 
how much more creditable is tile 
efforts of those students, who. every 
week, travel great distances to 
come to school, thereby suei"ncing 
additional time and perhaps sleep 
and rest. The man or woman who 
travels the greatest distance cer
tainly deserves to be acclaimed 
with the title of champion long dis
tance traveling night student.
To enter this contest all one has 
to do is to send in a few little bits 
of information. If you think that 
you travel more than the' average 
distance to school, then sit down 
and write on a sheet of paper liow 
many miles per night you travel, 
how many miles per week, and 
how many nights per week you at
tend school and also which school 
you are registered in.
Perhaps, before the contest ends, 
hew and uncrowned champions 
will be developed along other lines, 
and who knows but that a contest 
will be necessary to find out the 
bhorti-st traveler, that is, the one 
who goes the shortest distance to 
school.
Now, all the travelers are anx
ious to get inLo the swing, but in 
order to do so, the information 
should be sent to the Contest Edi
tor, care of The Plaid, and marked 
for Box 137, C. I. T., Sehenley Park, 
Pittsburgh, Pa. The information 
can be dropped in the inter-school 
mail slot in the post office some 
night when you are down for 
classes.
Resumption of 
Art Exhibitions 
Is Gratifying
News that the International Art 
Exhibition is to be resumed at the 
Carnegie Institute galleries this 
year has brought salvos of ap
plause from the great multitude of. 
art lovers here.
While lesser exhibitions through
out the city have been more nu
merous than ever before, the omis
sion of the greiit exhibition last 
year was LL severe blow to the cul
tural prestige of Pittsburgh. To
counteract what some believe an 
irreparable cultural loss, the direc
tors of Carnegie Institute promise 
the most impressive exhibit of in
ternational scope ever seen in this 
city. .
A new innovation this year is 
the selection of a jury composed of 
laymen instead of artists. Al
though contrary to the wishes of 
(he late Andrew Carnegie, founder 
of Carnegie Institute, this deviation 
from traditional practice will be 
welcomed by many who have con
sidered former juries too biased.
Weather Always 
A Good Subject
When you are inside looking out 
on a rainy, soggy day, dont you 
feel good that you have a roof over 
your head and are warm and dry? 
Yes indeed, its great to be com
fortable.
Did you ever stop to consider 
that, 110 matter how bad it is, the 
weather still has one redeeming 
feature? It always offers one an 
excuse to complain and is always 
acceptable as a topic of conversa
tion.
All of which reminds me of an 
incident that happened during n. 
History class session in high school 
which has never been forgotten by 
me because of the uproar it cre
ated.
On Mondays our up-to-date in
structor always insisted upon the 
selection of Literary Digest topics 
for discussion and an oral review 
by the class. One student selected 
a topic 011 sex. During the dis
cussion, mention was made of the 
new freedom apparently enjoyed 
by the younger generation in con
versation. This student was tell
ing the class that girls and boys 
nowadays had so many more things 
to talk about, than their mothers 
and fathers. Whereupon, the class 
nuisance interrupted with his per
tinent, remark"for instance, they 
iinn talk about, the wnat.her!"
Photographic Art
Exhibit Is Popular
The photographic art exhibit 
now on display at the Carnegie; 
Institute is very good. While the 
number of pictures displayed is not 
very large, their quality with re
spect to choice of subject and so 
on is much superior to any of the 
previous shows.
Industrials, semi-industrial con
trasts, pastoral and forested land
scapes are present. The new 
George Westingliouse bridge fig
ures largely in several of the en
tries. Some excellent portraits are 
included, and the still life advo
cates have their representation too. 
Nudes are uncommonly rare, as 
are painted expressions and strain
ed poses.
Trick shadow effects, unusual 
angles of light, very soft printing 
and. in a few cases tinting, have 
all been resorted to in order to de
velop some of the best photographs 
ever exhibited at the Institute. 
The short, time necessary to view 
the display, which is comparatively, 
small, makes it almost a social 
error to miss seeing it, to say noth
ing of the enjoyment that would 
be missed. Everyone who can pos
sibly arrange to visit > the gallery 
is assured an enjoyable afternoon 
or evening.
Novel Exhibit To Be 
Shown For First Time
One of the exhibits scheduled for 
the" exposition to be held at Chi
cago this summer is a periodic dis
play of the chemical elements. 
The display is to be mounted on a 
revolving wheel-like structure op
erating in a horizontal plane and 
surmounted by a globe represent
ing the earth showing the localities 
from whence the elements are ob
tained.
Each element will be shown in 
its native state, if it. so occurs, as 
well as in the refined state. Ap
plications of each will also be in
cluded, in the form of finished 
products made from the elements. 
TI10 rare gases will bo displayed in 
illuminated discharge tubes.
The exhibit will be unique, and 
as far as is known original. It is 
probably the first time that all the 
known elements have boon grouped 
in such a nianii6i\ at least in any 
place where the general public 
might view them. The display
will be well worth seeing and 
should he visited by anyone who 
attends the exhibition.

Wield Influence 
Over Architects
Architects, .long considered the 
most diabolical and vociferous ele
ment. on the campus, at least as 
far as the art school is concerned, 
are at. last yielding to the gentle 
influence of the P. and D. femmes. 
One. is astonished beyond descrip
tion, when upon entering a. draft
ing room, he is greeted with a gal
lant "hol-low." insteadof a roaring 
liya there you dingfazzled old 
euoaliptieal pachyderm," tlie tradi
tional and typical manner of rec
ognition of architects.
The reason for this sudden 
change to gallantry becomes very 
obvious when two fair besmpeked 
P and Ds raise their tressled 
heads to peer at the boy friend's 
boy friend. Architects have found 
out that a girl friend is an inval
uable asset..
Because of this transition, the 
familiar sights that used to greet 
the eye upon entering the. drhfting 
rooms during charette are appar
ently destined t.o become forgotten 
memories. No longer will we see 
architects with week-old beards 
and sunken eyes, eating apples 
and crackers 011 the fly" as they 
work feverishly far into the wee 
hours of the morning. Women 
have been trained to do the unin
teresting, tedious details.
It is true tiiat some indomitable 
spirit is evident, but an atmos

impressionable, youths, for they 
have learned to exploit their mas
culine vanity to new and magnifi

wrought this change, hence this at
titude of decorum.

Speaker Tells of 
Way to Success
Recently the writer had the 
privilege of being present among a 
group of business men attending a 
lecture 011 Effective Speaking 
given by Mr. Dale Carnegie in the' 
Keystone Athletic Club.
In his address Mr. Carnegie 
brought out the fact, that very few 
of us have the ability to say what 
we think before a group of people. 
Why is it. that we can converse 
freely with one another, hut when 
|t comes to addressing a gathering 
of .a number of people we becomo 
tongue-tied and are unable to de
liver the speech we had prepared? 
According to Mr. Carnegie, proper, 
training will overcome this handi
cap, and the personality of the in
dividual will be developed.
During the course.of the lecture 
II was brought out. that an ex
haustive study had been made re
cently at. the Carnegie Institute 6t' 
Technology to discover the causes 
of financial success. As a result. 
It was declared that about, seventy 
per cent of success in business is 
due, not to superior knowledge, 
but to the ability to got along well 
with others.

Students Should Take 
Proper Precautions
While authors have always 
sniffed at the weather as a subject 
for writing, the past week  has 
been hectic enough to warrant 
passing mention. With every pos
sibly variety of precipitation fall
ing, and winds of varying veloci
ties, from spring zephyrs to near 
tornadoes .blowing, the average 
citizen has resigned himself to re
garding umbrellas, raincoats and 
rubbers as permanent equipment, 
to be carriedjust in case.
Disregard of proper precautions 
during this season often results in 
many minor ills that lower ones 
resistance and likewise lowers effi
ciently. With the end of the term 
almost in sight, it would be well 
to care for ones self in a reason
able way. Simple precautions 
taken in time may prevent a loss 
of time that would be disastrous 
at this point in the school year.
Perhaps diet, avoidance of pro
longed. exposure on raw nights and 
as much sleep as a night student 
may obtain will all help/
Patriotism Is Easily 
A roused Despi te Belief
Some time ago,, the students of 
an English college voted in assem
bly that in the event of war they 
would not bear arms. The editor 
of one of our local newspapers 
asked pointedly whether these, men 
were sincere or whether, like 
babies, they were upsetting their 
porridge to attract attention.
The point was well taken. It is 
a matter of common knowledge 
that when flags are unfurled, 
drums are beating, and'bands are 
playing, a large majority of any 
population proceed to fall into line, 
march to war, and lose their life 
or limbs for a principle they do not 
understand, or for a cause that 
doesn't concern them in the least.
It has always been so, and always 
will be. These young men who 
proclaim their intention to remain 
neutral will fall in line and prove 
to be no exception to the rule.

After a short period of magic incantations he removes

EXPLANATION:
The girl was hiding behind the drape of the table. 
There is a trap door in the bottom of the flower pot, 
with a hole large enough to allow her to crawl through. 
The flowers, called "magicians feather flowers," are 
a regular part of a magicians outfit. The flower girl

flowers compressed into small space. She slides the 
tunic down and the flowers expand when she emerges.

in a cigarette comes from mysterious 
processes of manufacture.
EXPLANATION: All popular ciga

intensively, than others, because raw, 
inferior tobaccos require more intenCAMCLS

are made from finer/ MORE

The Elimination of the E
The Educational Senates action in eliminating the <rB 
from the grading system is a significant move to place the let
ter grades at Carnegie 011 a comparable basis with those of 
other colleges. The existence of the. E-has been superfluous* 
and has tended to cause misunderstanding among people not 
acquainted with the system of grading about the value of a Car
negie stiidents marks.,; Tliis is especially the case when stu
dents apply for fellowships, teaching positions, 01* for jobs 
where the employer scrutinizes the grade sheet. The majority 
of the colleges and universities, realizing that at best a system 
of grading is but a rough, estimate of a pupils ability, have' 
only three or four marks, some giving recognition to a plus and 
minus mark.
When comparisons are. made between the marks of stu
dents from other institutions, depite the fact that a full ex
planation is given about .the sj^stem of grading on the grade 
sheet, the student with..a .C.C average at Carnegiethe theo
retical average grade but actually above the averageis often 
classed with the C student from other institutions when the 
comparison should -be made with a B-minus or B student.
Aside from placing the grades on the same level with those 
of other institutions, other reasons given by the Senate com
mittee are that the grades and levels at Carnegie must be ad
justed in the minds of the parents of students and the students 
themselves because of the variance of the system from those of 
most preparatory schools and because often transfers find it 
difficult to receive credit for work done at other schools. It is 
said that one of the other reasons behind the Senates action is 
to eliminate the giving of a grade .which is/below that required 
for graduation.
The committee has said, and rightly so, that one of the big
gest fallacies of the existing system is that in times past stu
dents who have received As in such subjects as physical 
education and Es and Fs in major subjects, with their 
two and qne;.point credits, respectively, have graduated when 
their work in their major subjects lias not fully qualified them 
to receive a degree: By not giving points for marks below a 
D, the new system will eliminate this defect.
Many students will Welcome the Senates action whicli will 
retain the F or re-examination grade, in the system. As yet 
no action has been taken to readjust the point system to the 
new grades nor to determine upon what basis the new grades 
will be determined.
The action of the Senate should eliminate the misunder
standing and confusion prevalent under the existing system.
A Fair System of Nominating Members
Our hat must be doffed to the Druid organization of the 
University of Pittsburgh. Recently this group adopted an 
amendment to its constitution which will allow any eligible 
student to be nominated for membership by a petition signed 
by five or more male students. Such nominations may be made 
in addition to the nominations made by the members at he 
regular nominating meeting, the petitions to be considered ;r-> 
regular nominations. The purpose of adopting this method of 
nomination is to eliminate favoritism and fraternity politics 
in the selection of members.
The petitions must include a statement of the petitioners 
.activities and the degree of his participation, an accurate rec
ord of his scholarship for the preceding semester, and a com
plete statement indicating why the candidate merits election 
to Druids. A committee of three appointed by the president 
of the organization will thoroughly investigate the qualifica
tions of the candidates. The committee will determine the ex
tent of the petitioners activities, their progress in this work 
and the accuracy of their scholastic record and whether it meets 
the scholastic requirements. The committee will also determine, 
as far as possible, the character and personality of the candi
date. The petitions are to be issued through the oMce of the 
dean of men.
Although' this honorary will be local next year,..the cam
pus Druids would be taking a step toward commanding re
spect for their honorary if they would embody a similar provi'sion in their new constitution. It is most unfair for unqualified 
students to be elected to membership in the class honoraries 
while others wrhose records surpass those of students.electcd are 
not because of fraternity politics.
Tivelve Years of Service
Last night the Carnegie Branchof the Y. M. C. A. cele
brated its twelfth anniversary. For twelve years the campus 
branch has rendered unfailing service to Carnegie students. 
Much of the work done by the <{Y is carried on unnoticed to 
many students, such as supplying radios for Carnegie students 
in hospitals and developing relations between the students and 
the churches in the district. During Freshman Week the Y 
activities are indispensible and throughout the year many bene
ficial services are performed. The active and interested Com
mittee, of Management, Mr. Rollin' V. Davis, Executive Secre
tary, and the student cabinets have contributed much to the 
campus through their work for the Y. May the Y con
tinue its most worthwhile work on the campus.
/ Problem Student Council Must Face 
One of the problems facing the Student Council next year 
is the reduction of the number of large dances on the campus. 
Many schools have cancelled one or two of their biggest events 
this year .and although the Student Council .has not been, fprced, 
to take similar action, it is necessary that the combination or 
elimination of several of the big dances be given serious con
sideration. In normal times a full social calendar is advisable, 
but at present the financial situation existing among the stu
dents deems such consideration necessary.
English Ways
By PROF. LEO T. LAWLER
Our language, like everything 
else in the country, seems to be 
getting a new deal. What appears 
to be outmoded or innocuous is be
ing made ready for the scrap heap. 
The obsolescent is being rapidly 
made obsolete, and the borderline 
colloquialism is practically ready 
for the King. Those who have al
ways wanted their way in this mat
ter, and who have frequently been 
cited as authoritiesthey being re
sponsible for such standards as 
you hear this usage very common
ly, or most of the people I know 
express themselves in this manner 
they may be, credited with urg
ing a change; but it remained for 
those who. profess the language of
ficially to give any new attitude 
significance. In commenting upon 
recent movements connected witli 
these changing conceptions of cur
rent usage, the New York Times 
expresses a clean estimate of what 
is in process.
"The Kings English is going 
democratic nowadays in a revolu
tion led by no other people 
than some of the teachers of Eng
lish themselves. Its ancient and 
honorable traditions are openly 
questioned and even scoffed at. 
We are told that a preposition is a 
perfectly proper word to end a 
sentence with. We are advised 
that we may split the infinitive all 
we like if our object in doing -so 
is to more clearly express our 
meaning. And we may open our sensentences with conjunctions . . . 
The public, as a matter of fact, has 
already done the nullifying, and 
many teachers are swept along with 
the majority. They admit that 
grammatical prohibition does not 
prohibit. . They do not go all the 
way, of course. They still object 
to light-complected girl, If John 
had of come/' The engine was 
hitting good this morning, and 
These kind of bananas. They 
are in doubt about It seems to be 
them, Everybody brought their 
own tickets, and The kitten 
mews when she wants in, but they 
make large concessions to the 
crowd, and they strike off gram
matical shackles that have galled 
the salves of poor form for gener
ations. In brief we find here an 
expression of a recognition of the 
iliact that English is not a dead 
language, 'but is very much alive, 
growing and changing in accord
ance with the nourishment it re
ceives and the environmental in
fluences brought to bear on it.
The recognition of this condition, 
however, does not indicate that a 
revolution has occurred. It does 
not mean that the language of the 
street has suddenly become the 
language of literature. It does not 
mean that the logic of the science 
of grammar has been abrogated. It 
does-not mean that any new royal 
road has been opened, making the 
access to the fine art of thought 
expression easy. The teachers of 
English composition will undoubt
edly find it just as difficult as ever 
to acquaint their students with the 
accepted ways of expressing ideas, 
and to insure the habitual follow
ing of these ways.
POOR PLEBES
Hell week! The two little words that strike 
terror to the heart of every pledge, and for that 
matter, to the' hearts (if they have any) of the 
amicable actives that are forced to inflict the 
awful tortures to the poor Plebes, have been 
heard a number of times during the past couple 
of weeks and will be heard some more between 
now and the time that the middle of May rolls 
around.
The girls, because of their early rushing and 
pledging got off to a start a bit ahead of their 
fellow wearers 
of the pledge 
pin of the op
posite sex. 
Many amusing 
sights have 
greeted the 
eyes of visi
tors to the 
Arts school 
during the 
past week. Probably the funniest was the young 
lady that went around carrying a lighted candle 
all day long, or perhaps, the young lady that, if 
you had liappeued to see her at work, did the 
tracings of the floor designs in the foyer. The 
real fun was at the daily luncheon table when 
the poor neophytes were gathered in the grill and 
performances were more or less private, if you 
get what I mean.

DID YOU KNOW?
That Margaret Morrison now has a sorority all 
its,own? While it has existed for some time as 
a group within the present senior class it was 
not until a week or two ago that any one from 
the lower classes was invited to join their ranks. 
Its lucky that most of the bids had been accept, ed prior to the Arts school siege of initiation 
weeks.
That John Lowes is probably the most nick
named fellow on. th campus. John is known as 
Jitters, Fanny, and Deacou, as well as the 
customary Jack. Each of his three special 
titles has a story behind it which makes it 
stick. John also does his share of christening. 
His latest victim was Ranny, now Mercury 
Boyer. The nickname is not, according to John, 
because Ranny holds so many world records, 
but rather because of the density of that portion 
of Mr. Boyer that occupies the space between the 
ears.
Some of the little girls in Forbes Hall are get
ting mighty tired of being coached by the boys 
across the street. Our suggestion is to stop 
shouting and Sing, Brothers, Sing.
OBSERVATIONS
A couple of engineers wasted a whole after
noon watching Betty Farrell and Company, just 
hoping against hope that someone would fall. 
Better luck next time.
Spring is now a week old. The only girls that 
really had the coming of Spring beam upon them 
were the little lasses in Cedar Hall. If you date 
a girl from Cedar Hall you know what we mean, 
01* else youll find soon out.
Spring may be here, but wo wont believe it 
until the Alpha Kaps start having picnic lunches 
at the We'stinghouse Memorial.
That Anderson-Ferguson affair is progressing 
despite the fact that miles make a difference.
The swell new rat traps in the library arent 
quite big enough for this one.

WE MUSTN'T FORGET
The pictures from the morning paper last 
week. Olga Ravitcli and Evelyn Gamble follow
ed Louise. McCain in a little pre-April seventh 
propaganda. The spring snows also brought a 
couple of kittenish pictures of co-eds washing 
each others faces with snow.
We owe an apology to the Beta Sigma Rho 
pledges for tipping off the actives about the dec
orations for their dance. It seems we were a 
week ahead of the dance.*****
THE SING
Ten teams turned out to make the annual 
Greek Sing even better than it was last year. The 
singing was unusually fine with the teams seem
ing to benefit by the experiences they had ob
tained last year. Just how close the contest 
really was dawned 011 us when we heard five dif
ferent boys slip up to fraternity brothel's and 
whisper that they thought theyd won.
The winners, Delta Tau Delta, now have the 
cup reposing safely within the shelter over 011 
Clyde street way, while the runners-up, the D. IT. 
boys, are forced to remain content with memories 
of their big broadcast. Other fraternities partici
pating also deserve commendationthe Pi K. A.s 
for singing an original composition, some of the 
other fraternities for their co-operation despite 
their lack of a sufficient number of songsters, 
and everyone for the fine spirit shown.
*****
THE SWING
After the suspense was lifted by Prexy Baker 
when he presented the cup to tlie Winners, every
body settled down to enjoy the music of Charley 
McCormick and his lads. Whether it was the 
music or the moonlight (we told you so) that did 
it we cant say, but everybody was quick to for
get the disappointment that comes with defeat 
and the evening passed swiftly.
The assemblage of personalities was such as 
only gathers for occasions like Sing and Swing. 
Ex-Campus Queen Mary Mclveon was there with 
Browny, Betty Frost and Charley Hawk, Louise 
McCain and Sammy Wicks once more, and June 
Fulis with Kay Burns, then there was Brad Edleblut with Becky Williams and Betty Ailes and 
Fred Hoyt. Ruth Fackler and Jack Hiltz, the 
steadies, Helen Fleming and Ernie Lemon and 
Julian von der Lanken and Frankie Wright. *****
LOOKING AHEAD
It wont be long, till Spring Carnival. All the 
boys and gals are busy with committee meetings 
and plans. The 
show this year 
should be the 
best ever and

Margaret Morrison College 
Has Had Varied History
Formerly Just Part of College of Industries; New 
Building Equipped With Complete Laundry; 
Student Originates Name -Maggie Murpli
By GWEN
Margaret Morrison Carnegie Col
lege was formally dedicated on 
Thursday, September IS, 11)07. Dr. 
Arthur Hannnerschlag, president of 
Carnegie, in his address stated the 
purpose of tho institution in tho 
following question:
To make ai\d inspire tho home; 
lo lessen suffering and increase 
happiness; to aid mankind in its 
upward struggles; to enable and 
adorn lifes work, however hum
ble; these are womans high prerog
atives.
These words have become the 
motto of the college.
Previously the womens classes 
had been held in the same building 
as the mens. In the opening of a 
separate school for women, it was 
understood that tho Carnegie 
Technical Schools were in no sense 
c.o-educational, and that there 
would be almost 110 personal con
tact between tho men and women."
Margaret Morrison Carnegie Col
lege was quite different in its 
early days than it is today. Tho 
basement was equipped with a 
complete laundry, containing me
chanical washboards, electric man
glesfor ironing, centrifugal extrac
tors, starching and steam-drying 
machines, set tubs, and electric 
and gas irons.
On the first floor level with 
Woodlawn Avnue, was th faculty 
room, biology and chemistry lab
oratories, locker 0room, assembly 
hall and a few classrooms. Li
brary, study hall, and classrooms 
were to be found on the second 
floor.
The entire third floor was oc
cupied with sowing and cooking 
laboratories. The west; wing was 
equipped with a. complete culinary 
department for practical instruc
tion and demonstration in cooking; 
this included ranges, cabinets, and 
demonstration tables. TI10 east 
wing contained special dressmak
ing, sewing, and millinery equip
ment, also studios for drawing 
and design.
A model apartment houso fully 
equipped with every convenience 
for tho home was constructed on 
tho fourth floor. This included a 
living-room, dining room, two bed
rooms, butler's pantry and kitFirst Semester Honor

Editors Note: Now that beer
is assured the American people, 
what are the prohibitionists to 
do to prevent the legalization of 
hard liquors? Below is a sen
timent on this subject.
Time For a New Strategy
By Jacque Minnotte
A recent statement by Dr. Stan
ley High, editor of the Christian 
Herald and well-known churchman 
and dry leader, should be icause. for 
considerable thought on the part 
of those who, with the return of 
beer in the offing, plan a fight to 
prevent ratification of the repeal 
amendment by holding in line a mi
nority of states. Dr. High advises 
a complete change of dry strategy 
which will include a temporary 
abandonment of prohibition and 
the inauguration in its stead of a 
temperance program.
This appears to be the logical 
course. ' If the fight for prohibition 
is not to be lost for all time, a 
change in dry tactics must be 
made. First must come the ad
mission of a blunder in the aban
donment to a large degree of a 
temperance program, during the 
past thirteen years. The situation 
would not now, from the dry view
point; be so desperate had this not 
been tlip case. Prohibitionists 
have erred in snppposing the Eigliteenth Amendment to be in the Constitution Irrevocably.
Secondly, drys must admit that 
today popular sentiment is in oppo
sition to prohibition. In a democ
racy, the will of the majority must 
prevail. 11!, by victories in a mi
nority of states, repeal of tho 
amendment i.y prevented, tho vic
tory will indeed bo hollow. To 
block the will of tho majority would 
result In a lessened regard for the 
law iu those statos favoring re
peal.
Thirdly, there should be the ad
mission that prohibition .Is .Utopian; 
in spirit. It has boon, cynics to 
the contrary, a noble experiment. 
However, no. measure so idealistic 
can bo a succoss unless it Is ap
proved and supported by the maorlty. At tho present time, prohi
bition is not a success because it 
has not this support.
What then, having made these 
admissions, Is to be the course for 
prohibition forcos?
First, drys must concentrate 
their fight on one iront, the social. 
The old religious and moral argu
ments were never, and are not 
valid. Regulation of the alcohol 
traffic is first and last a social 
problem. Let dry forces show the 
effect of alcohol on the well-boing 
of the individual. If a definitely 
harmful effect is shown, an appeal; 
on this ground cannot fail. If 
drys cannot treat it as a social 
problem, then their cause is lost, for

certainly no other appeal can bo 
successful. Society is concerned 
with tho fitness of its niombors and 
iif drys present sound argumonts, 
based on scientifically, testod facts 
and free from hysteria, It is concolvablo that action' for regulation 
of tho traffic will eomo ovonually 
from tho majority.
Socondly, drys can ombarlc upon 
a program of temperance educa
tion, making their appeal to the 
Intellect rathor than to tho omotlons. Behind tho program, of 
course, should lie tho liopo for 
completo prohibition. . But. If  tem-t 
peranco Is taught first and tho 
public informed as to tho effect of 
alcohol, the way will bo pavod for 
tho return of prohibition, but this 
time with tho support and approv
al of tho majority.
It Is Important that prohibition
ists do not allonato tho support of 
millions by a 1 continuation of'the! 
tactics of tho past. Both wots and 
drys stand indicted for the fanat
icism of bigotism that lias marked 
tho fight to date.
The dry course for tho present Is 
to let the current anti-prohibition 
sentiment run its course, tho while

Dr. Ross Discusses 
Farm Relief Problem
Continued From Pnire 1
duction costs to perilous heights. 
They now handicap him in his 
fight for foreign markets just as 
surely as though a wire fence in
stead of an ocean separated Aus
tralian and American wheat fields.
To make matters still worse, 
France, Italy, Germany and other 
nations have lately imposed restric
tions upon grain imports.
In brief, America nourished and 
brought to maturity an agricultural 
colossus at the moment when only 
a medium sized agricultural unit 
was needed. The result is that 
gross farm income which amount
ed to $15(000,000,000 in 1919 drop
ped to about ,$12,000,000,000 in 1925 
and lately to $5,000,000,000 in 1932, 
This will not pay production costs 
on 1925 farm values. Nor v/ill it 
enable insurance companies to re
trieve their Investments In* farm 
mortgages. So the farmer and Ills 
creditors who oHvn $9,000,000,000 
In farm mortgages have set up. a 
lusty cry for fedoral help. To 
this knotty problem tho President 
has turned his hand.
Present indications are that it 
will be attacked from two sides; 
first by an attempt to increase tho 
price o.i! farm products, and see 
ondly by inducing the creditors to 
cut the value of their morgages.
Obviously the President may ex
pect to meet stubborn resistance 
from the 11011-farming elements of 
the country. That theae classes 
will quietly submit to farm salva
tion at a cost of from 3800,000,000 
to $5,000,000,000 per year to them
selves is too much to expect of 
national solidarity even in these 
sorely tried times.'
, Consequently a crucial test of
Presidential leadership Is In the 
offing. Every art and artifice of 
political manipulation from tho 
bait ol! 135,000 fodorul jobs danglod 
boforo hungry Democrats, to a ilroside chat with tho voters ovor tho 
radio will probably bo needed and 
omployod to tho full extent. If tho 
farm problem Is conquered It will 
be tho first break in a. seventy-year 
policy of drift.
The prize for absent mindednoss 
goes to our own school. A frater
nity pledge sent out to buy some 
Eskimo pies and to mail some let
ters mailed tlie pies and returned, 
With the letters for Ills hungry 
brethren.

chen. A lunchroom was also main
tained at a moderate cost for tho 
students. The gymnasium furnish
ed with dressing rooms, showers, 
and bath tubs occupied tho east 
wing.
The college was named for Mar
garet Morrison Carnegie, the moth
er of Andew Carnegie. During tho 
first year the enrollment was limit
ed to one hundred students and 
twenty teachers. The tuition was 
$20 a year for Pittsburgh residents, 
and an additional ten dollar foe for 
non-residents.
Among tho features of school 
life in Margaret M,orrison in 1907 
were noon hour dances and class 
debates. In geography class, the 
girls debated on world problems, 
such as RESOLVED that the Pan
ama Canal will not increase com
merce of San Francisco.
An interesting bit of Margaret 
Morrison school history is that con
cerned with its nickname, Magsie 
Murph." The following excerpt 
from a recent letter to Dean Tarbell from R. K. Merril, Charter 
Class 'OS offer the following ex
planation.
"While I am about it and iu a 
reminiscent mood, 1 might also tell 
you how the name Maggie Murph 
was originated. I have a friend 
who had gone through high school 
in the same class with me in Pitts
burgh, who is Mr. Albert W. 
Schenck of the Schenck China 
Company, Penn Avenue, near Fifth, 
who was the originator of this 
phrase. It happened in the fol
lowing manner:
I was riding with him in the 
Schenck family automobile (you 
will realize that this was back in 
tho days when automobiles were 
to he classed with amusements, 
such as merry-go-rounds, roller 
coasters, etc.) and we happened to 
pass'the biilldlng which was to 
house tho Margaret Morrison Car
negie School for Women. He then 
said, Why not call it Maggie 
Murpli for short. 1 was one of 
the editors of tho Tartan at the 
time, and I believe that in the next
