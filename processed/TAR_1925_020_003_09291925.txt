New Formation to Appear 
Against Thiel Team Next * 
Saturday
When interviewed last Friday even
ing, Coach Steffen determinedly re
fused to appear at all optimistic over 
the grid prospects. All of the di
vulged information savored of the 
minor key, which is so characteristic 
of that conservative publicity policy 
adopted by most coaches. There was, 
however, a very genuine undercurrent 
of pessimism, in his statements. Wally indicated that after the W. & J. 
game on October 17, he would know 
exa'ctly the caliber of this seasons 
team, and not until then. The men 
must prove their worth under such 
circumstances as will exist in that 
contest before, any precise statements 
can be made about the Plaid grid ma
chine.
L.ittle new work will be given the 
squad in the next few days, with the 
exception of a certain new formation 
which will be used against Thiel. The 
remainder of the time will be spent 
in perfecting that, and other of the 
more intricate and successful forma
tions. Good, hard, genuine drill in 
the running off of plays, with a bit 
of scrimmage, will occupy the center 
of the stage.
At present, all members of the 
squad are in good physical condition. 
The men have been very fortunate 
this year, and few injuries of major 
importance have been sustained. 
Eighteen men are in readiness for the 
first game, with several others held 
in reserve for possible use.
Coach Steffen has uot as yet picked 
a backfield quartet from the seven 
following possibilities: Captain Beede, 
McClelland, Bastian, Werteuberg, Har
man, Sebastian and Donohoe. Mar
shall is also a likely candidate for 
the backfileld.
Goodwin, Vogt, Powrie, Cowan and 
several others are still fighting for 
the terminals, while the linemen will 
be chosen from among Yoder, Cass, 
Cooper, Myers, Marshall, Mainby, 
Bielslti and a few more.
Captain Beede has been out in the 
thick of the fight every evening and 
is giving indication of making his 
last season even greater than its pre
decessor. He has proven himself a 
master of deceptive play. Beetle's 
dazzling execution of several trick 
formations last year accounted for 
more than one touchdown, and will in 
no doubt prove a valuable asset to the 
Plaid scoring machine this season.

ANNUAL RECEPTION FOR 
PLEBES ON OCTOBER 9
The annual reception given to all 
new stu,denljs by Dean Green and Dean 
Tarbell will take place on Friday 
evening, October 9, in the Faculty 
Club l oom of Carnegie Union. There 
will be dancing ai.d entertainment 
from S: 00 to 12:0
According to .a long-standing cus
tom, members of the Dragons and 
Mortar Board, the Senior honorary 
societies of the men and women re
spectively, will assist the deans in 
making the evening a pleasant one, 
which will long be remembered by the 
Freshmen. On the evening of the 
reception, these Seniors will act 
an introduction committee.
All Freshmen are urged to attend. 
Each year, this party is one of the 
outstanding social events for Fresh 
men, and furnishes an excellent oppor
tunity for the new-comers on the 
campus to make many friends among 
their fellow students in all four col
leges. Then, too, the party will bring 
together dormitory students and com
muters, who rarely meet except in 
class rooms.
The Freshman will not only meet 
members of their class, but will, be
come acquainted with some of the 
faculty with whom they will have 
close relations during the coming 
year.
The program for the reception is 
rapidly nearing completion. Although 
the exact nature of the entertainment 
is being kept a mystery, the commit
tee promises many innovations, some
thing better than last years stunts. 
This is saying a lot, for last years 
entertainment was the talk of every 
Plebe on the campus.
MASONS REQUESTED TO
REGISTER AT Y OFFICE
All Master Masons are requested to 
registei\at the Y. M. C. A. office in 
the Central Building, to become mem

in the near future at which every 
member will be expected to attend 
and take an aictive part. The presi
dent. F. M. Kelefanft. expects this 
year to be one of the best the club 
has ever had.
The football dance scheduled v I 
for this Saturday night has been | 
cancelled. *> j
The regular Saturday night v! 
dance after the Mount St. Marys *v I 
game October 10, will therefore v j

Teams
CALL AT FIELD HOUSE
Plebes for managerial work are 
wanted by the football squad. Appli
cants should report to Manager Rus
sell Roller of the varsity or Manager 
Depew of the Plebe team at the Field 
House in Margaret Morrison between 
3:30 and 5:30 p. m,. any day this 
week.
The positions or team managerships 
toward which these men will work, 
offer a number of rewards and oppor
tunities to the ambitious man. Both 
the Varsity and Plebe managers re
ceive regulation varsity sweaters 
with the football teams. This auto
matically makes them members of the 
honorary C Club, whose roll carries 
the names of all Carnegie's famous 
athletes.
In their junior and senior years, sev
eral members of the managerial corps 
are taken on each football trip. These 
men receive the same accommoda
tions as the players. Railroad fare, 
rooms, meals and tickets for the 
games are furnished gratis. As sev
eral managers are taken on each trip, 
every man who sticks till his junior 
year is sure to see one or two visit
ing games.
The upperclass members of the 
managerial corps receive their noon 
and evening meals gratis at the train
ing table during the three months of 
the season. This amounts to an act
ual remuneration for their services, 
besides affording an opportunity for 
close association with the team mem
bers and Coaches.
In their fourth year, these men are 
eligible for the position of varsity and 
plebe squad managers. The Athletic 
Council makes the appointments, act
ing on the recommendation of the out
going managers, the graduate mana
ger, and the coaches. These inter
locking factors assure the mainten
ance of choice , on a purely competi
tive basis, the quality of service ren
dered and the willingness of the com
petitors furnishing the material for 
decision.
As to the nature of the work. 
Plebes are required to do the menial 
labor', ;us might be expected. How
ever. they are treated with considera
tion, and no favoritism is shown. The 
work as a rule is not very laborious.
The Sophs are treated with greater 
deference, and are employed in the

Give Novel Quizzes
Iii order to determine the aptitude 
of students for particular branches of 
the subjects, placement examinations 
in Physics for Sophomores, and in En
gineering Drawing and English for 
Freshmen, are being held by the de
partments in charge.
The Physics. English and Engineer
ing Drawing Departments are examin
ing the results of the Placement exanis and deciding on the fitness of 
students for certain divisions of the 
curricula, In order that tiie student 
will be well versed in all parts of the 
subject, the Departments are placing 
them in sections which stress their 
less proficient branches. The work 
covered by all the sections, during the 
year is the same. This procedure dif
fers from the practice of the Math 
Department, in which regular and fast 
sections are conducted.
The Physics Department held exams 
for Sophomores on September 25, 28 
and 29. The exams covered the en
tire elementary fields of calculations, 
theories, and laws of Physics. The 
students will be classified into sec
tions and more time will'be devoted 
to fundamentals where necessary.
In collaboration with the Society 
for Promotion of Engineering Educa
tion, the Physics Department, through 
the placement exams, is attempting 
to determine if it . is possible to im
prove the curricula, and teaching 
methods of Engineering col leges.
Examinations^ in theme writing and 
grammar were held for Freshmen 1)y 
the English Department on Septem
ber 10, 18, arid 21. Working from the 
results of the exams, classes will be 
divided .nto sections that will empha
size grammar, theme writing, or a 
general English course.
Freshman Placement exams for En
gineering Drawing were held Friday, 
September 25. The exams consisted 
of a simple drawing problem, a letter
ing exercises, and intermediate and ad
vanced problems. The students will 
be classed into three groups, hut all 
will receive the same lectures and in
struction on theory. The problem for 
the first group will be presented In 
more difficult form, than those for J>ie 
third group, however. At the end of

will be similar to that of Iasi year.
An Eastern trip, along with many

Manager Cy Owen, together with 
the other officers have been working 
hard to gel the band in first class 
shape. Many of the old men are back 
and some excellent material from 
the Plebe class have reported, From 
every angle the prospects this year 
look brighter than ever before and 
big things should be accomplished.
Tlie first Puppet or the year, the 
"Dumb Number," is out today. This 
number, as tho premier Issues of 
other years Imvo boon, is written es
pecially for the Freshman, arid holds 
up the uuklml lovoaling mirror, for 
skeptic examination.
Tho now staff hopes to make the 
Puppet a bigger and 'bettor oollogo 
comic Ilils year than ever before, and 
also a little different from tho usual 
style of college magazines. The staff 
Is headed by J. It. Whitman, iOdltorin-Chlef with Mori) Polosle, Associate

a Puppet Key. The Freshman and 
not the Sophomore or Junior years is 
the better time to start. The more

Carnegie Plebes Given Mental
Tests By Psychology Department
Two rehearsals have been held so far, ^ .
it both of which more than fifty men INine AppOintCCl 10 Jt ellOWShlpS 111
Mental tests were given to Carne
gie Tech Freshmen on September 22.
These tests, under the supervision 
of the Psychology Department., were 
first introduced at Carnegie two years 
ago. They are similar to those given 
to entering students in practically all 
I the leading colleges and universities 
I in the country. While the tests used 
this year were similar to those used 
here in 1923 and 1924, they differ in 
certain respects. They nave -under
gone certain changes in content and 
form, which are, in each instance, 
marks o improvement over the pre
vious tests.
According to Professor Cleeton of 
1 the Psychology Department, the tests 
; serve as a source of information to 
-the administrative officers and provide 
valuable data for their use: "They
make possible:
"(a) Comparison of mental qual
ity of the Freshman class at Carnegie 
with classes at other institutions;
(b) Comparison of llie class of tho j 
current year with classes of previous!
years;
(c) Comparison of one division 
or section of the class with other 
sections or divisions;
(d) Comparison of one student ' 
with other students.
Student scores made in these tests 
are one fource of information used in 
dealing with the individual student | 
problems. In such instances the-test 
record usually serves as an aid to the 
student. In no case Is tiie test score 
used to the detriment of the student 
The test scores simply help to bring 
s't'ont -i better understanding of tlm 
student and his problem, but do not

or admission ratings.

HARRIERS START 
TRAINING SEASON
A Capacity Crowd at Notre Dame---View Taken During the Nebraska Contest
Plans For Season Outlined at 
Meeting Held in the Var
sity Club Room
Last Thursday at 4:30 p. in., the | 
candidates for both the varsity and1 
Freshman crosscountry teams assem-1 
bled in the Varsity Club room in the ; 
new gym and started the season off1 
with a great show of enthusiasm. After about forty men had assembled, 
Manager Wright introduced the coach, 
Quy Halferty, to the new men. Coach 
Halferty has directed the efforts of 
the harriers for two seasons past and 
is very popular with the men who 
have been -under his tutlage both last 
year ftnd the year before. He urged 
. upon the men the necessity of daily, 
conscientious practice, and stated that 
after the first few days, the workouts 
would settle down to a steady routine.
Captain/Peck then gave a short ad
dress on the necessity of fixing a 
definite training program, and religi
ously following it. He also cautioned 
the men against becoming discouraged 
at their efforts, and stressed! the fact 
that the other man is just as tired 
as you are, and perhaps, a little more 
so, and so for that reason never to 
give up in the middle of a race.
The details of the schedule were 
explained, and Manager Ed. Wright 
stated that there was a possibility 
that a trip would' be arranged before 
long.
Not much is know about the Fresh
man candidates, but they are a likely 
looking bunch. Only eight Freshmen 
signed the list that was passed around 
there should be many more than 
that. That is an excellent opportun
ity for Plebes to get their numerals.
... The following are some of the men 
who reported for the varsity squad: 
Fritsche, Davis, Power, Graham, Vick
ery, Sponseller, Tower, Hobe, Himes, 
Reuben, Saikin, McNair, Patterson, 
Lustenberger, Ewing, Paul, Lockard 
and Fry. Captain C. E. Peck took 
charge of the men last Friday and 
assisted Coach Halferty in giving the 
candidates a brief workout.
The Freshmen who have signed up 
are: Fuller, Weamer, Allison, David
son, Wilson, Linkert, Murdoch and 
Haven. Let's go, Plebes.
The men will dress in the locker 
room of the gym, as was the arrange
ment last season.

the result of posting a notice in the 
New Gym, has obtained the names of 
some, forty men.
A meeting of these men will be 
called shortly, and an effort made to 
determine what sort of an arrange
ment for coaching is desired. If a 
class is started, it will be under the 
management of the Physical Training 
department; if a team is desired, 
"Buddy Overend will be consulted. 
Dr. Esciuerree, of the P. T. department 
expressed a willingness to co-operate' 
along the former lines, and before the 
week is over, it is hoped that some
thing definite will be done.
All persons interested should get in 
touch with Dietrich at 301 Scobell

STEFFEN TALKS ABOUT THE TEAM
When interviewed last Friday afternoon, Coach Steffen seemed any
thing but optimistic. The men are facing a very hard schedule and do not 
seem to realize just what it means, in terms of hard work. Although the 
team seems strong from an outsiders point of view, the way it is being 
stone-walled by the Freshman aggregation is giving the Judge some cause 
for worry.
There is much speculation going on as to what the new formation will 
do against Thiel. If it is anything like Wallys trick plays of the past few 
seasons, it will bring the stands to their feet.
The entire squad attended the Pitt-Wasliington and Lee tilt last Satur
day afternoon, as guests of the Panther; following the contest Coach Steffen 
boarded a train for his home in Chicago. 1-Ie will not return until the morn
ing of the Thiel battle. Assistant Coach Bob Waddell took full charge of 
the squad beginning yesterday.
THE HARRIERS
Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of the party, and 
no mistake. .The Cross-Country team is gathering every afternoon at tho 
foot of Industries Hill for its daily jaunt over tho bridle paths of S.chenloy 
Park. The team this year Is any mans team. Get out and try your luck. 
It is an excellent chance to earn your letter.
An effort will be made this season to give the harriers the publicity they 
deserve, and which was somewhat neglected lats Reason.
AGAINTHE MANLY ART
After a somewhat hectic existence last year, boxing again looms up, 
more earnestly than ever. It Js time that the students should decide either 
pro or con on the proposition. If a boxing class or team Is desirod, It must 
be supported whole-heartedly by the student body, and not by a mere handfull of enthusiasts. Take it upor down, but settle the question.

PLEBES TO MEET OLD 
RIVALS ON SATURDAY
The game with Slippery Rock is be
ing looked iorward to by the student 
body with a groat deal oC interest. 
Reports Irom the game Saturday with 
Mt. Union show that Slippery .Rock 
ln\s a very powerful team. They have 
many veterans back and aro all set to 
repeat last year's victory over the 
Plebes.
The definite lineup that will start 
the game with Slippery Rock is still 
undecided, although Coach Anderson 
has better dope on it than ho had last 
week. Lucky Anderson and Lef/.elter are still fighting it out for the 
fullback position, and it is an even 
bet on which ono will start tho game. 
The other backfiold positions will bo 
held down by Crum at half, and Lim
erick and Harpster at quarter and the 
other i'lalf. Tho biggest problem is to 
pick the two ends from Allen, Rankin, 
S'weet, and Kuosman, all capable men. 
Mielziner is almost suro of left tackle, 
and Lovewoll, whose injury has 
healed, is showing up well at guard. 
This leaves Cunningham, English. 
Young and Roisinger to fight for the 
other line places. Criol, a now man 
who played with the Florida freshmen 
last year, is showing up well on tho 
line. Morrow injured his knee in 
scrimmage and will probably bo una
ble to got into tho game Saturday.
The team leaves for Slippery Rock 
'Saturday morning in charge of Bob 
DePue, the Freshmen manager.

ATHLETIC SEASON 
OPENED FOR GIRLS
Five Inter-School Teams to 
be Formed Among 
Co-eds
Tlio girls athletic season was for
mally opened last evening when tho 
Margaret Morrison Athletic Board con
vened' to draw up its plans for tlio 
coming school year. As in former 
ytars there will bo the four class 
teams from the womens school and 
a team from the College of Flue Arts. 
In all probability the five groups will 
immediately begin on their respective 
bowling, ttenuis and a.rchery sched
ules. These three sports receiving 
special emphasis during tho fall seasou. Later on, a rifle team is to be 
foir)m(ed. Last year the marksmen, 
or markswomeii, as you will, were tu
tored by several of the officers in 
charge of the R. O. T. C. department 
and tho sport proved extremely pop
ular.
Freshman girls are urged to join 
ono or other of those teams at onco. 
A system of points has been compiled, 
and' has been in existance for several 
years, by means ot wnlch the girls 
are awarded regulation varsity "C 
sweaters in their Junior and Senior 
years, Each sport actively engaged 
in carries with it a specific number 
of points toward a letter, and pins aro 
given for various minor numbers of 
these points. Obviously it behoves 
one to enter these activities early in 
tlio Freshman year.

PAGE FOURTHE CARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 29, 1925
Arthur D. Little Voices Challenge of Science
To Industry in Address to Chemical Engineers
WILL YOU?
When the football season open next Sawrday, 
the Plebes, for the first time, will attend a Car
negie athletic, contest as Carnegie students. 
Whether they will come as loyal members of the 
Freshman class will depend on them alone, but in 
recognition of the position they have now attain
ed as members of the student body, in loyalty 
1.o the traditions of their college and out ol respeet for the distinctive style of dress adopted for 
them, they should wear their caps, and sit in their 
own section.
Football crowds are always colorful, but how 
drab a Carnegie crowd, and the snake dance 
would be without the Plebes and their dinks. 
Then there is something splendid in the man 
who will obey a regulation which he knows he 
might be able to avoid. Secretly cvery Plebe is 
proud ol! the hat he wears, no matter how much 
lie says he detests it and although some may dis
card them and attend the game as mere specta
tors, they will be as outcasts when the cheering 
of their, own section rings out and they feel the 
call of comradeship.
So instead of .planning how lo see the game 
without wearing his cap, every Plebe should come 
and sit with his own group and not in some other 
section, a traitor to his class.
JLftOPCrt. rilood of new knowledge pouring from, 
the laboratories. To those with vis
ion, science is bringing countless new 
opportunities for constructive and 
profitable effort, while it is likely to 
take whatever they may have from 
those who will not see.
Industrial developments along new 
lines are everywhere in progress, and 
they call upon the chemical engineer 
for new equipment and methods of 
production and controll. Contact pro
ceses, operating at high pressures, 
present many new( and serious prob
lems, which we have as yet hardly 
considered in this country."
"Although I have read no more 
than the first word of the handwriting on the wall, it must be clear to 
all that in the industrial revolution 
which it portends, the chemical engi
neer will be on the firing-line. He 
will be called upon to attack and con
quer new problems at every step of 
the rocky road from the laboratory 
to the plant. The Institute of Chem
ical Engineers has devoted much con
sideration to the education required 
to fit the chemical engineer to meet 
his new responsibilities. Let us now 
endeavor to educate the manufi&cturer to realize the opportunities be
fore him, and let us teach the inves
tor to appreciate the perils that con
front the companies which ignore re
search.
Use your brains! That is the chal
lenge of science to the modern indus
try of today. Progress Is made only 
through devising new methods and 
not groping blindly in the darkness 
of our fathers. This is the warning 
to industry, according to Mr. Arthur
D, Little in his speech given before 
the American Institute of Chemical 
Engineers.
Science is now advancing at a rate 
so rapid and with results so farreaching, that no industry can hope 
to Ignore research and live. Slimmer 
follows winter with such unfailing reg
ularity that the ice business would 
seem to be reasonably secure. But 
the ice man has now to reckon with 
the probability that a million elec
tric refrigerators will be installed 
within the next two years.
There iB a hand writing on the 
wall of industry that cannot and must 
not be ignored. It is on the wails 
where Rotary clubs lunch, where man
ufacturers conventions dine, where 
chambers of commerce meet and 
where trade associations ..gather, it 
outshines at Atlantic City the illu
minated signs that compell attention 
to cigarettes and chewing-gum. At 
the present time I am willing to in
terpret the handwriting that confronts 
our industry. It reads: The price
of progress is research which alone 
assures the security of dividends. It 
is our imperitive duty to translate 
this handwriting to those who mis
take it for a mural decoration. 
American manufacturers must be 
made to understand, declares Mr. Lit
tle, that we are in the midst of an in
dustrial revolution, in the course of 
which many established businesses 
will find their balance-sheets dyed 
deeply with red, unless those charged 
with responsibility of management can 
learn to direct their courses in the

Again an instance comes to our attention in 
which one of Pittsburgh's yellow journals and its 
brother publication in their avid search for smut 
have excitedly decried the name of Carnegie for 
its sensational value. On the morning ol! the 
twenty-second, a three column head trumpeted 
gleefully from the upper corner of a second page: 
Detective Captures Tech Student
About to Hold Up Gambling House 
and proceeds to explain :
A loaded revolver and a mask in his 
pocket, Philip * ' * and said to be a student 
at Carnegie institute ol Technology, was ar

if true, this news would aggrieve us and we 
might reflect that the ultimate asininity is always 
reserved for the college student. Blit the expose 
never matriculated at Carnegie and the cireumphrase: And said to be" becomes a haven of 
refuge.
We resent scandal even when true, but after 
such an unwarranted attack, only the broad end 
of a paddle properly applied can give full vent to 
our indignation.

FIRST ORGAN RECITAL
IN MUSIC HALL SATURDAY
On Saturday night, October 3, at 
8:15 o'clock, Or. J-Ieinroth will give 
the first organ recital of this season 
in the Carnegie Music Hall. The 
Sunday concert will be given at four 
o'clock, October 4.
This, will be Dr. Ileinroths nine
teenth year as organist and Director 
at the Carnegie Institute. It is the 
tliirty-flrsj, year iu the history of the 
Music 'Hall.
Dr. Hoinroth is one of the foremost 
musicians of tho country. It is his 
purpose lo give to the Pittsburgh pub
lic some of the things its lack of a 
symphony orchestra prevents, the mu
sic of all nationalities, and of all 
grades of all periods. In this way 
tho people become acquainted with 
music and learn to love it.
The Week
1921-22
The Carnegie of my adolescencefor Carnegie re
ceived mo with a grunt of welcome In September of
1.1)21...was a much different Institution than it is today.
The last remnants of that virile race of uncultured hemen who survived tho (. M. T, (3. and a math depart
ment notoriously hard boiled, were rounding off their 
courses with an oxtra year, and did little to remove 
the visions of Insurmountable quizzes wo soon conjured 
up.
They were corduroy trousered rough nocks who 
cooked canned soup and corn In their rooms to dimin
ish living costs, and inserted tinfoil or pennies behind 
lln* fuses when their battered hotplates threatened to 
overload the line. Savings wore invostod in radio sets, 
and aerials slg-zagged about lllco cobwebs in fairyland.
I till, this was in) fairylandrathor a rehabilitated army 
camp,
And when Mr. Orbln thought of tho light house
keeping, the crumpled corduroys, and the jabberlifg 
Slovak charwomen all under the direction of an evasive 
Slovak porterwho, Incidentally, Is now flourishing as 
an Insurance salesman-his hair turned a little grayer.
The I'lebes all joined the It, (). T. C. Not that they 
were interested In military training, for they never at
tended drill, hut tlio uniforms made convenient working 
garments and could be replaced annually at. no cost. 
And then thorn was the commutation of rations of 
thirty cents a day to look forward to.
Tho eating problem was a truly dllllcult one. The 
Commons, then aptly termed tho Meanory, served beaus 
and mashed potatoes at extortionate rates thrice dally. 
It was generally reviled but. without succoss, being 
managed by an ex-baseball player for the profit of tho 
Varsity Clan. Upperclassmen might oat In tho girls' 
cafeteria, then on the top lloor of Margaret Morrison, 
Is they had time. Crockery from here may now be 
discovered at the Inn marked with a curiously ontunglod M. M. c. c. S.
The Ski ho was already a recognized campus Institu
tion and having little competition, was extremely dirty. 
Despite its tired out appearance, the structure was 
the rendezvous of post dance couples who laughed and 
gigged over their ice cream and fig newtons, while loud 
voiced Bohemians from the dormitories gathered about 
with pretzels and coffoe.
Intrepid spirits sometimes ventured as far as Oak 
land to dine at the Blue Birdthe Hole in tho wall 
and survived to brag of their exploits. Yet in spito of 
tho miserable meals, scholastic mortality was no higher 
than now.
'Pile football season was marked by its wetness and 
the remarkable success of the Steffen shift. The 
crowds boou jeered when the program sellers cried: 
Tell the players by their numbers! and had difficulty 
in discerning whether the mud-slopped figures were 
friend of foe. The brilliant turkey-red jersies had not 
yet displaced the traditional gray, and beneath the 
drizzling rain the field appeared sodden and drabeven 
yellow slickers were unknown.
The football season passed with but two disappoint
mentsW. & J. and Penh Stateand few flurries dis
turbed an existence of enforced study. Once we Plebes 
had the misfortune to anticipate the Sophomore ban
quet.
Quickly assembled, we gathered nervously about the 
banquet hall to await the Sophs. The latter arrived 
and refused to accede to our request or releasing the 
Freshmen Presidents. The hotel proprietor intervened 
to avoid the probable demolition of his hall and prom
ised that the Plebes wishes should he respected.
We departed appeased. Two van loads! of police 
left unscathed, and our presidents, through a misunder
standing, remained handcuffed to the stairway outside. 
But the Sophs wore piqued and returned to tho dorms 
with straps cut from street cars to call for a pajama 
parade through the snow. Tho straps left their mark 
and many of us rested uneasily for several days there
after. Doan 'Parboil sot tied tho claims and eollocted 
from tho Sophomoro class.
The Shilling also made its debut. Tho girls of 
Margaret Morrison felt tho need to give expression to 
their aesthetic beings mid concolvod a wabbling youngs
ter. Finding that It needed constant, cuddling and 
nursing yet rarely responded by more than a quarterly 
"Goo, Goo," they quickly tired of their toy. Vet to the 
questions of neighbors iu Science and Industries tho 
girls always boldly asserted that tho Shilling Is really 
doing remarkably well.
Tho tennis team shone that year. Tho commandant 
of the K. O. T. C. took the candidates under Ills wing, 
and put them through the manual of arms. When 
army Inspectors paid their visit, he graciously received 
them and carried the olllcer away for an afternoon of 
billiards at the P. A. A. The Carnegie unit ranked high 
in military circles when lie was commandant.
A MOCK TRIAL
Worlds News*Price, complete 
'with case, $60Upperclassman superiority has triumphed over 
many things at Carnegie during the last few 
years, and chief among the traditions it has dis
torted is the dormitory trial. It is a screamingly 
funny paradox that those trials wore originally 
conducted in an orderly and formal fashion, and 
the victims wore not Plebes exclusively, but mem
bers of all classes. In fact,/the majority of the 
unfortunate ones were upperclassmen, not Plebes.
However, of late the phrase dormito/y trial 
connotes merely unwarranted hazing, The trials 
have degenerated into a workout for restless and 
perverted Sophomores. Dignity and justice are 
words entirely foreign to the "razzing parties" 
that are frequent occurrences in the men's dormilories these nights. A few evenings ago a splen 
did trial was being conducted in one of tho halls. 
A group of half dressed Sophomores had horded 
the I'lebes into one of the halls, and justico was 
being dealt on nil sides, The Plebes were tub
bed and paddled...paddled with two different
paddles for the sake of contrast and with a 
third one to bring about the necessary unity. 
There were no charges brought against the vic
tims, excepting excess quiet and study, tilings 
never to be tolerated in a Carnegie dormitory.
Dormitory trials, properly conducted, aro nee 
essar.y and meaningful. There, should be a Trial 
Committee appointed in each ball to take charge 
of formal trials and to see that the burlesquing 
is stopped. I lazing lias never been considered a 
Carnegie tradition and when it is an end unto it
self it can be of only negative value in a Plebes 
first introduction to life at Carnegie. If the dor
mitory trials are to do more than reassure upperclassmen of their superiority, they must adhere 
more closely to the spirit of their original pur 
pose.

Tlio entire world Is wntching anxiin England, both politically and in
dustrially. All throughout the coun
try there is tho spirit of unrest, of 
fear of the future. From tho highest 
to the lowest there seems to bo a 
dread of what tho future may bring. 
Recent developments, such as tho de
cisions at tho Scarborough Trades 
Union Congress, which Lend vory de
cidedly toward tho Increase of com
munism and revolt, have a tendency 
to upset tlio older conservatives. One 
visitor to tjondon reports ou going 
to Hydo Park, the place whore all the 
agitators are allowed to air their 
EOCXB unmoloBtcd'ly, and there hear
ing fifteen men give speeches. Of 
these 11 Cleon, only throe were radic
als and tho rest wore conservatives. 
This hi merely an indication of the 
very serious condition that tlio ONTTIR 
llshman thinks ho is in. Under ordin
ary circumstances there would bo no 
conservatives but now they are very 
worried and send men there to coun
teract the radicalism.
A large number of vory noted men 
are commenting on] tho situation in 
tho public press, in* the attempt to 
awaken England - to! her approaching 
catastrophe. Phillip' Gibbs, for exam
ple, tho noted war corrsepondent and 
a very keen observer of economic con
ditions, writes that;, if England fails 
as she is likely to do IT steps aro not 
taken shortly, the world loss can not 
be calculated. If so, the Oriental 
Empire will be a Hamming anarchy 
and the world will have lost its 
strongest defense, against brutality 
and tyranny.
The economics of the situation are 
interesting as a background of the sit
uation. Englands life depends upon 
her trade. She would starve within 
a week if cut off from the rest of the 
world. With the war over, the old 
markets had disappeared and the new 
ones, due to lessened purchasing 
power and defiat ion of the currencies, 
were relatively difficult to get. It 
meant for trade, stagnation and for 
England it became,increasingly diffi
cult. Her ships became idle, and her 
unemployment increased, until now 
the result is a very serious condition.
Tho only final solutionis education 
on the fundamental reasons hack of 
the situation, but whether this can be 
accomplished before a break comes is 
a matter of doubt.
Education can only be the answer 
to a host, of problems that have to do 
with industry. The sooner the men 
of all classes come to realize that to 
produce or to distribute, we must 
have all tho factors, not one or two, 
Just so much the sooner will tho in
dustrial unrest, begin to diminish. 
This illustrates with particular vivid
ness the crying mod for propaganda 
along the linos of business economics.

A LITTLE HELP!
The plea is posted! Almighty Allah, please 
send us some Plebes, is the general petition of 
those organizations needing embryo student man
agers, and as usual, Allah proves frugal.
The dearth of hrosh volunteers for these posi
tions is noticeably consistent, and the state of 
lively competition for these places of honor that 
should exist, is lacking. No greater opportunities 
for service to Carnegie, attainment of dignity, re
spectability, and campus prominence are availa
ble. The possibility of material rewards alone 
the trips with the teams, coveted athletic sweat
ers, physical training credit, make these honor 
positions exceedingly attractive. Yet; the lists 
stand open, and comparatively few men enter the 
field of competition.
Many Plebes are frightened away by their first 
glimpse of the toiling field managers. In their 
mental panic at. the possibility of hard physical 
labor, they foigot to make a complete investiga
tion and analysis of the work. They fail to noto 
that several crews alternate on the heavy routine 
jobs. They do not remember that; the average 
athletic season lasts but ten or twelve weeks, or 
take cognizance of the fact that these men avo 
receiving practical training in executive and or
ganization work.
The heart-harbored knowledge that youve 
got to have a pull its all fraternity* graft, 
anyway or that if youre not a handshaker 
you might as well spare yourself the agony- 
gleaned from the chronic pseudo-bolshevist who 
thrives on the college campus, or picked up at 
tln> latest bunk session, keeps many names oil* the 
roll of potential managers. The records are open. 
The Plebe who takes enough interest; in tho school 
to check up on these statement, will no doubt 
report at the field house the day following. The 
Plebe who makes an attempt to meet the mana
ger-type, by applying for preliminary instruc
tions, will find himself engrossed in the business 
of absorbing the managers personality, finesse 
and ardor, within the week.
Plebes, managerial work is urged as a valuable
