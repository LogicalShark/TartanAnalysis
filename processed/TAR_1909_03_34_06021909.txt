VOL. Ill, No. 34 PITTSBURG, PA., WEDNESDAY, JUNE 2, 1909 TENCENTS
GRAND FINALE
Civil Engineering Society.
The Civil Society held its last meeting for the 
year Friday evening, May 28. According to the 
usual custom the Plebes who have chosen Civil En
gineering were invited, it being a kind of introduc
tion into the spirit of the society.
The Plebes were well represented, there being 
about twenty present.
President Kettei made a short address of wel
come, in which he outlined the privileges as well as 
the responsibilities of the society.
Professor Thayer was then called upon, and in his 
masterly way gave a little history of the society. 
He said that membership called for activity, the aim 
being to have .the students meet and discuss sub
jects of interest, and have a social time. He gave 
little glimpses of his Senior Civils. The Mutts are 
a strong organization. They swear by an old brown 
vest. This vest has a history. It was introduced 
into the society by Scotty Henderson, one of the 
charter members. It is rumoied that it has been 
worn in many an affair of honor. The Black 
Knight at one time wore it beneath his armor. Af
ter him many English and Scotch Nobles were proud 
to possess it.
A new member is made to wear this ancient gar
ment. As evidence of its protective qualities he is 
hammered with stones and clubs. No injury ever 
results, for its charm is complete.
Dean Leete, who is a member of the society, spoke
briefly to the Seniors and Plebes. He urged the 
former to be satisfied to start with smajl things. 
The latter were told to make sure that they had 
chosen the right course.
The engineering discussion of the evening was 
led by Professor Foss. A piece of tunnel work of 
which he had charge in the old Minnesota and North 
Western was the subject.
Lantern slides were shown of various stages of 
the work. The tunnel described was about one-half 
mile long. Almost the entire length was through 
soft material, which required timbering as fast as the 
work progressed. The general discussion which fol
lowed developed the fact that the cost of a tunnel 
is about the same as a cut whose average depth is 
sixty or seventy feet.
After the lecture Jamie did heroic work at the 
piano.
The commissary committee soon reported and the 
final contest began. The experienced ones did jus
tice in the usual way, butthe Plebes were almost 
overcome by the lay out.
After the feed, stories were in order. Everyone 
seemed primed for the occasion. The lights flashed 
thrice, but all in vain. Lanterns were lighted and 
the stories continued. The best ones were told by 
their romantic glow. Amici was sung as a fitting 
climax to a series of very successful meetings.

M. M. C. S.
The Class Day exercises of the first class to grad
uate from the M. M. C. S. will be held Monday, June 
14th, iif ar the Serpentine Driveway, Schenley Park. 
The exercises will begin at our own building with 
the ivy planting. This part of the exercises will 
not be open to the public, only tho Seniors, Juniors, 
and members of the Faculty being present. The 
planting will be followed by the Ivy Song, and the 
Ivy Oration by Harriet H. Ellis.
At the close of this the Seniors will be escorted 
by the Juniors to the grounds, where the rest of the 
exercises will be held.
The second part of the program is as follows: 
Singing of the Womans Song.

The Class is working hard and hopes to make the 
day one long to be remembered. Admission will be 
by invitation only.
Accompanied by Miss Bradt, the Senior House
hold Arts Class visited the Rittenhouse last Friday 
afternoon. Mr. Kuhn personally conducted us through 
the establishment. From the top floor we had a 
view of the new addition now being constructed 
with a roof garden that can be used both summer 
and winter. Here we also looked down on the famil-, 
iar ball room and dining room where the Daughters 
of 1812 were holding forth. Crowding into the ele
vator, we descended to the kitchens where Miss 
Herron made a hit.
After inspecting the various kettles, etc., we went 
to the rooms where the ices are made and frozen. 
Here the chief attraction seemed to be the huge ice 
crushing machine. As we watched the man feed
ing the machine with a hundred pounds of ice at a 
time, we remembered our struggles in the House 
with five pounds of ice and one small pick and the 
punctured fingers resulting therefromand sighed 
as we remembered.
Next we descended to. the bake rooms. Each suc
ceeding descent had so far meant an increase in 
temperature until we began to feel the need of an 
asbestos coat. But in spite of the heat the bake 
rooms proved the most interesting of all. The cake 
and icing mixers were especially attractive. In fact, 
Miss McKee was so stuck on them she had to be 
removed by force. We thought we knew all about 
icing cakes, but we certainly learned better here. 
Urn-m-m! Those chocolate cakes with icing an inch 
thick!
But we had to tear ourselves away at last. We 
then began another descent down a narrow and 
precipitous stairway. This time we confidently ex
pected to meet the prince of the lower regions him
self, but we only found the ice man! or rather the 
man that looks after the machinery that makes the 
ice, for this was the refrigerating plant.
Then we were conducted to the upper regions and 
daylight. By this time we had learned to pack our
selves into the one small elevator as deftly and ac
curately as a Heinz pickle packer. Having reached 
the main floor we were taken to the dining room and 
served with ices, cake and coffee with Mr. Kuhns 
compliments. When we left we felt quite as impor
tant and self-satisfied as any Daughter of 1812.
The Beta Phi picnic on Memorial Day proved a 
most delightful affair. The day could not have been 
more perfect and the eats were all that the most 
vivid imagination could picture. The scenerj^ along 
the Verona car line is most beautiful at this time 
of year, and the long ride in the delightful woodsy 
air gave us all ravenous appetites. Every Beta Phi 
present had a perfectly splendiferous time and re
turned at night thoroughly tired but happy.
Miss Carlin and Miss Sawhill will repeat their 
Chautauqua venture this summer at Mountain Lake 
Park, Maryland. This is an ideal place to spend 
your vacation (the guide book says so), and the 
Briar Bend Cottage will be an ideal place to get 
meals and board, as it will be run strictly on House
hold Arts principles.. The Cottage will be open to 
receive guests after June 21st. 
(Testimonials furnished on request.)
IN THE BUREAU DRAWER.
The shirtwaist had just been put into the bureau 
drawer.
Oh, dear! she sighed, How nice it is to be 
starched and ironed and foldedit makes me feel 
quite respectable. Good afternoon, Miss Polka 
Deautte, how is the rent in your cuff? What did 
you say? Congratulations for my article in the 
Weekly Clothes?' Thank you. Did you all read it? 
You didnt, Carrie Mennruffle? Well, Ill tell you 
about it, if you wish.
It is simply a history of my life. The first thing
I clearly remember it as spreading cotton field on a 
southern plantation. I was on the very highest bush 
in the field, and felt considerably puffed up. My stay 
here was short. When the cunning little seeds that 
nestled close to me were ripe, a direful tragedy oc
curred. For a few days I had noticed dark figures 
walking back and forth across the field next to ours. 
Soon a monster started down our row. Nearer, 
nearer, it came until a huge black paw reached out, 
tore me rudely from the branch and stuck me n a 
basket. That was the last I ever saw of the sunny 
field.

The next epoch in my life I shudder to tell. It 
gives me the creeps even yet, when I am near any 
kind of machinery or wheels. (Thats why I dislike 
automobiles.) Would you believe it, I was thrust 
into a dark labyrinth of ill smelling metal. I almost 
fainted, and therefore can not relate distinctly what 
took place; when I emerged, totally exhausted, there 
were no darling seeds or leaves. My anguish at 
that moment is indescribable. Later on I encoun
tered many torments, but none of che rest affected 
me so deeply. You see I was young and unsophis
ticated then.
In a short time I found myself in a huge bale, 
'!,3und with steel bands. I became acquainted with 
one, a Mr. One-inch Cotton Tye, and he told me of 
his career through the Homestead Mills. I was car
ried on board a fine large steamer, and was launched 
on an uneventful journey up the river to a manu
facturing town.
Here I suffered a great blow to my pride. The 
bale in which I was so carefully pressed was sent 
in a wagon to a noisy factory. Alas! for my pretty 
white softness. After a nerve-racking race in more 
machinery, across queer cranks and racks, I was 
pulled out, yes! actually elongated, into a long, 
skinny thread! My position was extremely uncom
fortable; I felt as though I couldn't account for my 
whole length. I wept and wept at finding myself so 
homely. But what was the use? I resolved to be 
philosophic, and so I didnt complain after the first 
disappointment.
The treatment that followed wasnt so bad. I 
was put in a loom, and woven into a web of cloth; 
once again I felt an interest in life; it is so much 
more satisfying to be a surface unit instead of one of 
length.
I was wrapped around a stiff board, and became 
known as a bolt. No, I was spared the dyeing vat.
I should have died, I know, had I been immersed in 
that. I didnt stay long in the warehouse, but had 
a long, hot, dusty ride on a train; then I was carted 
to the Coalville Drygoods Emporium!
The very day I was put on the shelf, a rosy-cheek
ed, blue-eyed girl came in, and asked the young 
man clerk to show her some cheap material, as she 
wanted to make herself a waist. The clerk picked 
me immediately. I was elated, for then I didn't 
know what cheap meant. The girl looked over 
many pieces; the young man was very much con
fused, and succeeded in knocking down bolts of 
cloth, and dropping his scissors and yard stick. At 
last he cut me off the bolt, wrapped me up, and pre
sented me to the girl. He forgot to ask her for the 
money, too!
When Molly arrived home, she went up to the 
sewing room, and bravely started to sew. iShe fished 
up a pattern from the overflowing box; it was a 
Peter Pan (the pattern). After many strange mutterings and portentious frowns, the while she looked 
intently at the pattern, Molly spread me out on a 
wide table, and cut me out! However, I was accus
tomed to sudden changes, and controlled myself.
Molly creased and basted and sewed and ripped, 
and finally evolved me as I ama short-sleeved, 
turned-down-ccllared, pocketed, Peter Pan waist. 
And maybe she isnt afraid of me. I like to be 
worn with her cherry red tie, dont you? 1 heard 
Molly say, while she was ironing me, that I am to 
go to a picnic the day after to-morrow. I must be 
careful not to get mussed.
P. F., 11.
Miss M.I wish I had a pair of scissorsmy 
finger bothers me.
Miss E.Would you cut it off?
O, where, tell us where, did that lovely orange ice 
go?
O, where, tell us,- where did that lovely orange ice 
go?
We saved it to refresh us 
After lectures long and dry,
And its oh! in our hearts, how we wish it had not 
went!
There was a young lady of Lynn,
And she was so frightfully thin, .
That when she essayed 
To drink lemonade,
iShe slipped through the straw and fell in.
FACULTY BASE-BALL TEAM.
The Faculty base-ball team is hard at work in 
preparation for the game with the Seniors, and al
though there is a good deal of disappointment over 
the Board of Consol's decision to not allow the use 
of the new field, the game will undoubtedly be 
played somewhere. The Senior class had better be 
getting out in force if its members do not wish to 
suffer another humiliating defeat such as was ad
ministered last year. Capt. Reed has the aspirants 
out every evening and has a large crowd to pick 
from. In fact some of the students suspicion that 
ball playing ability must be a not unimportant qual
ification for an aspirant for a teachers position to 
possess.
The team will be picked from those playing last 
year with the addition of one or two new faces. The 
line-up has not been decided on definitely, but will 
probably be about as follows: Catcher, Sill or Dosey; 
pitcher, Leete; 1st base, Dosey or Lightner; 2d base, 
Orbin; short stop, Reed; 3d base, Lightner or Keller; 
outfield, Pfouts, Crabtree, and Lightcap. No matter 
what the initial line-up, Capt. Reed is going on the 
presumption that he will hfive to use all his wiles 
to win, so everyone will get a chance to shine either 
in the field or as a pinch batter. Professor Follows 
also says he will play if the management will meet 
his terms and allow him to use a cricket bat. 
Messrs. Thayer and Hokanson are handicapped by 
a tendency to serve a base-ball a la tennis, so that 
they will p'robably not make the team.

At the Board of Control meeting, held on the last 
Friday in May, Director Hamerschlag was present 
and advanced a suggestion that if carried out would 
make for the best interests of all concerned at Tech. 
His suggestion was that if any important legislation 
was contemplated, such as those involving a large ex
penditure or any change of policy, the subject matter 
of the proposed change should be published in The 
Tartan at least a week in advance of final action on 
it, and that it also be posted on the bulletin boards 
so that every one should have a chance to see and 
discuss it.
From every point of view the suggestion is good, 
as in bringing matters before the student body before 
final action everyone will be forced to take cogni
zance of them, or at least registenfoo kick if the de
cision is against what they consider good policy, pro
viding that they have made no effort to register an 
opinion. A great many who have made no effort to 
acquaint themselves with affairs in the past have 
frequently objected vociferously to decisions ren
dered by the men to whom the power to render 
them has been given. This state of affairs would be 
ended if the legislation should be published as sug
gested, as in case it seemed objectionable it would 
be easy to call a class meeting and instruct the 
delegates as to the attitude of the class. This would 
relieve the delegates of some unwelcome responsi
bility and also relieve them of the explanations often 
asked as things are run at present.
The White Friars production has come and gone 
and was a success both frcm a financial point of 
view and also from a dramatic point of view when 
it is compared with th<* first production last year. 
All the fellows knew their lines and seemed not 
afraid to speak them. The dancing and singing 
were both good and spoke volumes for the work 
done in preparation. A little stronger moonlight 
or one diluted with a little plain yellow light would 
have been desirable in the second act, but that is a 
minor matter. What is most to be noticed is that
admirable spirit that inspired the members of the 
cast and chorus and carried them through the long 
hard rehearsal period and enabled them to stage a 
show of which we have no reason to be ashamed. 
Mr. Edmundson is to be congratulated for the suc
cess of his efforts, as is also Mr. Dorrington, arid 
the Club is to be congratulated on having such a 
competent coach and musical director.
There have been various suggestions as to what 
the Class of 1909 should leave behind it to commem
orate its various enterprises during the members 
sojourn at Tech. We dont believe that any one 
has ever suggested a day or two devoted to clean
ing up the school grounds. The vista across the 
street in the Park is all that can be desired, but 
the surroundings as viewed from Forbes street are 
anything but beautiful. Beginning with the shanty 
that stands as a monument to the enterprise of a 
son of the celestial empire who lingered with us 
long enough to learn the art of soap manufacture 
and ending with the wreck of what were once cabletowers  gracefully distributed around a couple of 
diminutive locomotives left in our keeping by Booth 
& Flinn, the ensemble is one that lends itself to a 
process of beautifying.
NOTICE.
The Secretary of the Schools wishes to announce 
that he will be in his office each day from 12 to 1 
P. M. to consult with students regarding summer 
work. There are quite a number of available posi
tions and every one should be able to find some
thing to do. All students desiring work should con
sult either the heads of their various departments or 
the Secretary as early as possible.
| - PLEBE CLASS |
The Plebes were terribly shocked on Friday dur
ing Physics lecture. Some were so affected that 
they danced all around the hall. Isnt strange what 
a little bit of electricity will do?
Everyone is delighted over the list of examina
tions, doubtless. A great burden of learning will be 
put by the board during the coming finals.
To see our illustrious instructors prancing madly 
over the tennis court fills us with admiration. If 
scientific knowledge ever makes such wonderful (?) 
players of us, we should surely be happy.
An all-day matinee was held by the Plebes in the 
drawing room on Saturday.
According to the list of exams, they are going to 
cheat us out of a Mechanical drawing examination. 
Were not anxious for the exam, but what shall we 
do with the surplus knowledge?

The result of the competition of the students in 
Architecture for the Patrons Prize offered by Mr. 
Hornbostel for the current year was announced at 
the Patron Dinner held at Donegal Inn on the even
ing of May 22. Mr. W. F. Burkhart was awarded 
the prize.
Mr. Burkharts work for the year has been of great 
excellence in his curriculum as a whole. In design, 
the subject of study on which the competition was 
based, he advanced from the beginners class in Or
der problems to Class A. Plan problems within the 
current school year. In the first competition of the 
year in the Order problem class he was awarded 
mention with special honOr by the Society of Beaux 
Arts Architects in New York. He was also awarded 
a first mention in Class B Plan by the Society. Mr. 
Burkhart is a resident of Greensburg, Pa., and is 
twenty-five years of age. He entered the Depart
ment of Architecture in September, 1908. Before 
this time he had served as draftsman in architects 
offices for six years.
The scholarship which provides for European 
travel during the summer vacation by the holder is 
warded to the student having during the school 
year the highest standing in architectural design 
and freehand drawing.
The other students who were the closest compet
itors of Mr. Burkhart for the scholarship were 
Messrs. Victor Rigamont and F. H. Smart, both of 
Pittsburgh.
Mr. Burkhart expects to sail for France 'n a short 
time in company with Mr. Gabriel Ferrand, Profes
sor of Design in the Department of Architecture, 
who, with Mrs. Ferrand, will spend the summer va
cation in France. Mr. Burkhart will probably spend 
about four weeks in France, two weeks in Spain and 
six weeks in Italy. He expects to resume his archi
tectural studies in the School next September.
PERTINENT AND IMPERTINENT.
Comrade Smith made a nice distinction when he 
said he wanted everyone to think of Memorial Day, 
and not of Decoration Day. In explanation he said 
that it is true that we decorate graves, etc., but in 
a broader sense we do it all in memory of the many 
who fought and diedhence Memorial Day.

MEMORIAL DAY EXERCISES.
On Thursday of last week the ^Schools observed 
Memorial Day for the first time. The students of 
the Schools of Applied Science and Design assembled 
in their large Physics lecture room and listened to 
addresses by Commandants McClintock and Smith 
and Dr. Allen of the Grand Army, and we must not 
forget to mention Erasmus Wilson, also of the Grand 
Army.
Commandant McClintock was introduced first and 
related some of the stirring Incidents in the Senate 
when the .Southern Senators resigned as members 
of that body. Mr. McClintock was a Senior at Yale 
at the outbreak of the war and went from college to 
the army. He closed his address with an earnest 
appeal for the type of patriotism that causes an in
terest in l.ocal politics and good government.
Director' Hamerschlag next introduced Dr. Allen, 
who was one of the pioneer teachers of the Schools 
as a member of the navy during the war. Dr. Allen 
launched into his address' by telling a story about 
watering their horses. Leaving us somewhat in 
coubt as to the exact status of thjs nautical cav
alry, he proceeded to give us a very interesting 
talk. Commandant Smith, who followed Dr. Allen, 
said that he only intended to clinch the speeches of 
his comrades. After administering a graceful re
buke for the Directors unfortunate substitution of 
Decoration Day for Memorial Day, the clinching 
was done in a convincing manner and he gave way 
to Mr. Erasmus Wilson, the Qijiet Observer of the 
Gazette Times. Mr. Wilson said he knows what 
regiment ended the war, but would not say, owing to 
a desire to spare the feelings of the others present. 
A pleasing mixture of humor and pathos, together 
with a few reminiscenses, closed his address, after 
which the fellows showed they could still yell a bit 
and everybody went home to lunch.
SIGMA TAU ENTERTAINS.
Sigma Tau celebrated the opening of its new 
home by entertaining informally the friends of the 
fraternity on Monday afternoon. Mrs. Gibbs, as
sisted by the members of the Fraternity, served light 
refreshments to the guests and those present were 
given the first formal glimpse at the new quarters.
Nine men were suspended from the gymnasium at 
Cornell this week for violation of the honor system 
in falsely reporting the amount of exercise they had 
taken.

THE TARTAN
THE NEW FOOTBALL RULES.
a
An important change in the foot-ball rules for the 
1909 season was made by the inter-collegiate foot-ball 
rales committee, which completed its session in New 
York recently, in the reduction of points for a goal 
from the field from four to three.
The object of the change, it is stated, is to prevent 
two goals from the field counting more than a hardearned touchdown and goal. Commenting on this 
change, members of the committee said that it would 
reduce the importance on teams of star field goal 
kickers, and make it harder for a mediocre team 
with a good kicker to beat out a better all-round 
team without a star kicker.
Another change of importance was one designed 
to prevent confusion in inflicting penalties, when 
two penalties had been incurred by one team for the 
same play, by giving the offended team the option of 
saying which penalty shall be imposed.
A change was made in the rules relating to a 
touchback, so as to relieve some of the hardships 
of the team down under its own goal, especially 
when it has been forced there otherwise than by 
rushing. The new rule gives the team making the 
touchback two rushes before the kick, while the old 
rule only provided the option of kicking out or keep
ing the ball for a scrimmage on the line.
A rule was adopted providing that when a center 
feints or makes a fake attempt to pass the ball, his 
team shall be penalized five yards.
Another change relating to the enforcement of 
penalties makes the rules provide that no penalty 
can be imposed to carry the ball over the line, either 
for a touchdown or a safety. It was also provided 
that hereafter play must immediately stop when the 
referee blows his whistle for a foul. There was 
some confusion last year in this respect, due to the 
fact that play was continued after the whistle was 
blown. 
INTER-COLLEGIATE TENNIS TOURNAMENT.
Last week the annual inter-collegiate tennis tour
nament was held at Grove City College. This is the 
first year Tech has been represented and a fair 
showing was made for the first time. Decker and 
Satler played well in the doubles, and with a little 
more practice together would have given the win
ners a hard fight. Allegheny College University of 
Pittsburg, Tech, Grove City College, and Geneva 
College participated in the tournament. Allegheny 
won first and second places in doubles. Grove City 
was second in the doubles. On Tuesday evening the 
contestants in the tournament were entertained by 
the. fair Co-eds of the college at a dinner given in 
their large Dormitory. A very enjoyable evening 
was spent, although dancing was not allowed.
Next year the tournament will be held in Pittsburg

MHO CLUB MEETING.
The Mho Club held the last meeting of the year 
on Friday evening, and they had as guests about 
twenty members of the Plebe class, who expect to 
be Electricals in the near future.
President McCorkle expressed the hope that they 
would all be with us next fall: Gov. Stone replied
in his usual graceful style, thanking the club for its 
hospitality.
Through the efforts of the Executive Committee a 
splendid line of refreshments was .served. It was 
indeed a touching sight to see Sophomores and 
Plebes in such close and joyful intercourse.
At taps the meeting was adjourned, everyone 
voting it a pleasant evening.

PERTINENT
AND
IMPERTINENT
The Seniors in the (School of Applied Science gave 
their ages for publication in the Thistle without a 
murmur. Why did not the M. M. C. S. Seniors* do 
likewise? Their failure to comply has led to much 
disappointment, for many had looked forward to 
these official statements. Age is in itself only an 
arbitrary matter, and is of value only in a compara
tive way. But some basis should have been given, 
just to prevent bad guesses. The class might have 
agreed on some average age and had it published. 
This would have prevented any unfair advantage, 
and would have been quite satisfying.
Mr. Hower, in quizz, asked: How are lines in a 
new star different from those in an old star? 
This sets one to thinking, for there are many kinds 
of stars. Obviously a theatrical star is intended, 
since the White Friar production is so near at hand. 
But how about the lines? This must of course refer 
to stars in general. Now, a new star and an old 
star would probably have the same number of lines, 
at least, while on the stage. There being so many 
special cases it seems impossible to give any definite 
rule. Leave it to the audience. A new star is 
new when she is first seen, while an old onewell, 
her picture was in the papers years ago.
Did you ever see Lincoln? !Then the next best 
thing is to see Saint-Caudeus representation of him. 
A look at the face and form thus portrayed gives 
one a truer feeling toward the man than any history 
or biography can do. His presence is convincing 
how could one doubt him? After seeing him, we 
know why his once rebellious war cabinet came to 
respect and adore him; why the armies in the field 
fought with the feeling that they were right; why 
the South mourned with the North when he was 
dead. All this is, of course, a tribute to iSaint-Caudeus. He makes us feel as Lowell must have felt, 
when, in his commemoration ode, he wrote:
Nature, they say, doth dote,
And can not make a man,
Save on some worn-out plan,
Repeating us by rote:
For him her Old World bonds aside she threw,
And, choosing sweet clay from the 'breast of the 
unexampled West,
With stuff untainted, shaped a hero new,
Wise, steadfast in the strength of God, and true.

SUPREME PLEASURE.
Ive read about the sudden joy that fills the miners 
breast,
When after weary weeks of useless toil,
His pick sinks in a pocket and he comes upon 
a nest
Of golden nuggets hidden in the soil.
Ive pondered oer the happiness that must possess 
ones soul
Who gets a letter in the morning mail,
Saying: SirYour wealthy uncles died and left 
to you the whole
Of his fortune. Gee! Thats like a fairy tale!
When a multi-million-heiress promises to be your 
wife,
You may feel a similar access of bliss.
But youve had all these sensations, if just once in 
all your life,
Youve run across a circumstance like this:
You dig up last years summer suit, when April 
comes around
(If in the fall you didnt have to hock it)
Then what a yell of happiness you give, if you have 
found
A bunch of street car tickets in the pocket!
