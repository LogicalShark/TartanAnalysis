Jones Loses Close 
Eng. Senate Race
John Beatty, Ckairman of the 
Elections Committee, announces 
that there will be four polling 
places available for tomorrow's 
elections. One is in Administration 
Hall, for freshmen and sophomore 
engineers, and one is in room 152 
Industries for junior and senior en
gineers. The other two are near the 
main entrances of Arts and Mar
garet Morrison. Students must pre
sent their athletic cards to vote. 
Polls will be open from 11:30 to 
2:30.
In the past, the Independent 
Party on campus was thought of as 
being permanently deflated. To 
those who still dream of a truly 
representative student governing 
body, let them be reminded that 
Chuck Jones, Independent candi
date for the office of President of 
Engineering Senate, lost the elec
tion last week by a -mere 17 votes! 
The final tabulation was: Galbraith 
422; Jones 405.

New Changes To Be 
Discussed At Student 
Council Meeting Tonite
Since the essential parts of the 
Student Council Constitution were 
written in 1923, many of the clauses 
are now out of date. The elimina
tion of student salaries last year 
necessitated the removal of the sal
ary article from the constitution. 
Thus Student Council President 
Jack Van Arsdell explained the 
cause for the changes in Councils 
Constitution which were proposed 
at last Tuesday nights meeting. 
Those proposals will be voted on at 
tonight's Council meeting.
Several changes have been made 
in the proposal since its reading at 
the Council meeting. Disregarding 
the formal style of the proposal, 
these are the main changes:
(1.) Abolishment of all college 
Senates.
(2.) Representatives to Coun
cil to be elected at large 
with one representative 
for every 100 students.
(3.) Representatives in EngiContinued on Page 6

as Managing Editor.
The new plan was devised to take 
care of the extra semester due to 
the expedited program. It consists 
of the election of an editor and man
aging editor from the seniors who 
will be in school next semester, the 
rest of the staff to compose an edi
torial board from the present junior 
staff. Plans call for members of 
this board to be issue editors,-either 
singly or in pairs, their duties as 
such being to assume the position 
of managing editors. Next spring, 
a complete new staff will be elected 
from the editorial board to serve 
for their last two semesters.
The Editorial Board will consist 
the following juniors: Dave
Neuss, Ed Goldstein, Elaine Levin, 
Walter Darby, Gerry Edelson, T. J. 
Harmany, Louisa Saul, Doreen Bar*y and Helena Aronson. From the
C. M. C. A. cabinet, the Rifle Team,

ident of the women's journalistic 
honorary, Alpha Chi Alpha, and is 
a member of Kappa Phi Delta and 
the Mortar Board. She was one of 
the Tartan staff secretaries during 
the preceding two semesters.
The official announcement of the 
new positions will be made at the 
Tartan Banquet, to be held at the 
Royal York Apartments at 6:30 P.

Highlight of this occasion vfill be 
the unmasking of J. B.prominent

Beta Sigma Rho was the winner 
of the fraternity scholarship trophy 
which was awarded today at the 
Carnegie Day ceremonies. This is 
the second successive year that the 
Beta Sigs have won this award, 
this time with a factor of 2.41. Trail
ing close behind was Theta Xi with 
a factor of 2.35 and Sigma Alpha Ep* 
silon with a 2.305. The Tau D&lts, 
who won permanent possession of 
the Phi Kappa Phi Scholarship 
Trophy two years ago when they* 
won it for the third successive sea
son have now slipped to last place.
Boss Hall easily took the mens 
dormitory scholarship cup with a. 
factor of 2.57. Next in the competi
tion for this cup was McGill Hall 
with a factor of 2.39.
The factors of the sororities make 
all the others seem diminutive. The 
Mu Alpha Gammas barely led this 
group with the impressive factor of 
2.8. Gamma Gamma Gamma and 
Alpha Kappa Psi rated second and 
third with factors of 2.78. and 2.69 
respectively.
The girls dormitory award went 
to Mellon Hall. Last year Mellon 
was one of the stragglers but this 
time it nosed out last years win
ner, Whitfield Hall, with a factor of 
2.53. Whitfield and Forbes Halls 
placed second and third in this 
group with factors of 2.46 and 2.45.

A Slight Misunderstanding
Last weeks front' page story which announced the xesults of the Stu
dent Council elections was, we find, misunderstood by the majority of the 
. student body. The Tartan, at that time, stated that Bob Galbraith and 
Jim Boyce would be elected President and Treasurer of Student Council, 
respectively. Many students believed that we were announcing the results 
of the vote for the office of President of Engineering Senate. Let us ex
plain the political set-up of last Tuesdays election: At lunch time the stuan(j ideological leadership, have aldents of the College of Engineering voted for the President of Engineering 
Senate, The candidate receiving the majority of the votes cast was elect
ed to that office. The candidate with the second highest vote became Vicepresident of Engineering Senate. Both of these men, the President and the 
Vice-president of Engineering Senate, then became members of Student 
Council.
Student Council then elected the incoming president from any person 
holding_an office (President or Vice-president) in either Engineering or 
Arts Senate. The Tartan learned, weeks ago, that Bob Galbraith was se
lected by the Fraternity Combine as its candidate for Council President.
Obviously, since the fraternities are in control of Council, they could elect 
whomever they wished, which in this instance was Bob Galbraith.
While on the subject of politics, we should like to remind the student 
body of the election which will be held tomorrow. Certainly, in times like
An ColUgiat* Pr Fmtura
The Question of colleges shirking their duty and perpetuating the pril, 
ilenod class smtem is one that has been discussed many times. In the j0i. 
lZng ProVTZ editorial THE COLUMBIA DAILY SPECTATOR 
sents a point of view with which we heartily concur.-Ed.
American colleges and universi
ties, secure in their traditions of ac
ademic freedom and intellectual
ways been looked upon as a vital 
part of the democratic heritage. Yet 
today, for the first time, they are be
ing compelled to face openly the one 
issue they have avoided, but which 
directly challenges their right even 
to consider themselves a part of the 
democratic way of life.
For the blunt fact is that the 
whole system of higher education in 
this country is built upon the basis 
of class privilegefor the colleges 
now, as in the past, continue to 
draw their students primarily from
these, every student should exercise his right to vote. We should like to those financially able to afford an 
see the Independents win, but somehow, we hesitate to say so because 
of the fear of driving more people to the other side. Sometimes our edi
torials affect people that way, so let the record show that we are impartial 
on the matter.
Kits The Boys Goodbye
With this issue, Volume 36, Number 12, we step down from the duties 
of the Tartan Editorship and turn over our keys to the newly elected stall. 
It is with a certain feeling of pride that we end our brief journalistic career 
with this sixteen page Carnegie Day issue; it is with a feeling of regret that 
we leave the Tartan offices where we have spent the majority of our Fri
day evenings during our four year stay at Carnegie Tech.
There have been many subjects which we wanted to discuss in this 
column, items which were crowded out by what we considered more Im
portant subjects. However, perhaps they were better left unsaid, for we 
certainly had our hands full fighting for what we had already said. Our 
sole aim during the year was to make the Tartan a better paperto give 
Tech students their moneys worth. If we have succeeded, our efforts have 
been amply rewarded; if we have failed, we can simply say that we have 
done our best.
The publication of any paper requires the cooperation of many individ
uals and organizations. On this score, the Tartan has been most fortunate. 
Speaking for the entire Tartan staff, we should like to take this opportunity 
to thank those who have made the weekly appearance of this paper a re
ality. Speaking for ourself, we should like to thank the underclassmen of 
the Tartan staff for putting up with an Editor who has, were sure, made 
life miserable for them.
Well, thats about the end. Theses still a lot to say, but there are only 
so many words that will go into this space. So, to our last Tartan editorial 
we write, Thirty.'
Opinions expressed in the pages of the TARTAN are those of the members of the .staff; in the case of the editorial column they are those of the Editor. They are to be construed <w necessarily the opinions of either the student body or the faculty.

education. As a people, we have 
seldom questioned this condition. 
We have built up legends about 
students who work their way 
through college" till we have al
most convinced ourselves that the 
opportunity for higher education is 
open equally to all elements in the 
population. Yet we have failed to 
realize that, not only are colleges 
to a large extent reserved for those 
who can afford it, but even those 
who either partially or wholely 
work their way are able to do 
so simply because their families do 
not require their earnings for sub
sistence.
Difficulties of graduate students
On the graduate school level  
medicine, law, engineering, etc.  
the lines of privilege are even more 
sharply drawn. Since work in these 
advanced fields requires considera
ble more attention than college 
studies, graduate students as a rule 
find it difficult to hold jobs at the 
same time, and consequently great
er emphasis is placed on the state of 
family finances.
In times of peace, a system of col
lege and graduate education based 
on privilege hardly jibes with the 
sacred American principles of 
"equal opportunity for all. In war
time, its undemocratic character is 
accentuated both because it leads to 
serious waste of effective manpower 
and because it inevitably hardens 
the class distinction in the armed 
forces.
That the American people are 
now paying through the nose as a 
result of their delusions about high
er education is seen in recent re
ports of the national resources plan

the country annually is losing a substantial part of its best brainpow. 
er because the financial means for 
providing the proper traiing for that 
brainpower are unavailable.
Colleges source of material
By now, most of the colleges have 
forgotten that the original Selective 
Service law, which only permitted 
temporary deferment for students, 
was efficiently designed to prevent 
the rise of a privileged group ex
empt from service. The various re
serve plans however, by drawing 
officer material from students after 
they had been admitted to college, 
became a convenient means for cir
cumventing the clear intention of 
the law. No one will deny that de
ferment is necessary to enable a student to receive adequate training; 
but deferment and eventual com
missions belong to those who de
serve them on the basis of ability, 
not to those who were able to 
for the opporunity to receive them.
Since the army and navy depend 
on the colleges for most of their 
ficer material, the effect of perpel* I 
uating the traditional basis for ad
mission can only be to strengthen 
the degree of privilege which perI 
vades the armed forces. A demo
cratic army is one whose officers 
are drawn from all elements in the 
population and not limited to the 
sons of the comparatively well-todo.
The changes which must be made 
are simple, yet clearly revolution
ary in nature. In principle, they 
are contained in the plans now be
ing evolved in Washington. What
ever the form of financial aid 
adopted, it must be made clear that 
there can be no compromise with 
the basic principle that higher ed
ucation is not the possession of a 
particular class, but the right of all 
the people, with the government as
suring the realization of that right 
when necessary.
up to the colleges
It is common knowledge j edu
cational circles that government - 
ficials had originally intended iu p* 
the new plan into effect dumiK 
past summer. However, fear ovc* 
the political implications of the rev
olutionary proposal, not to mention 
the threatened opposition of religi
ous groups and old-line educators 
whose belief in democracy is lim
ited to pretty speeches, is said to 
have stalled public announcement.
For this reason, it is now up to the 
colleges, their faculties and their 
studentsthose most affected by 
the new proposalsto rally behind 
leaders like President Conanl of 
Harvard and show the world that 
they understand that democracy 
tolerates no privileges. Should they 
fail to renounce the present basis 
for higher education in the United 
States they shall in effect have 
given the lie to all their sacred tra
ditions and all their wee won 
about freedom and equality.'*"e

Cameron Of rracht Tartan Gives 
Carnegie Authentic Scotch Colors
By Mel
Carnegie Day, with all its history 
and tradition, seems an opportune 
tiirif to point out some of the wealth 
of history and tradition that 
abounds in soine of the institutions 
of our school.
More mistaken ideas exist about 
Carnegie's colors than on any other 
tradition of the school. Instead of 
adopting school colors like every 
other school in the country (and 
freshmen, still ask, What are Car
negie's colore?), Carnegie Tech has 
chosen the tartan of the clan, Cam
eron of Erracht. Yes, that design 
of the varsity letters aiid the bands 
kilties is the Cameron of Erracht 
tartan, and is never referred to as 
plaid.
The Tartan is one of the oldest 
traditions of Scotland, the native 
land ofour founder, Andrew Car
negie. Each Scottish clan has one 
or more tartans which are the pat
tern or design of th clth of the 
kilties of the members of the dan. 
In no other country has the clan 
system with its outward vestiges, 
tartans, armorial bearings, etc., sur
vived as in Scotland.
Andy Carigie was th son of a 
Scottish weaver, who tfas the son 
of a Scottish weaver, who was . . . 
etc., ad infinitum The connection 
between his family, or as we Scotch 
say, sept, and the Erracht Camer
on Clan is hazy at best.
Snyder
The Tartan of Erracht was spec
ially dedgned for the 79th Cameron 
Highlanders in 1793 when the reg
iment was formed by th famous 
Sir Allan Cameron of Eiracht, K. C. 
B.; Allan's mother created the tar
tan by blending th tartan of her 
clan, the Me Donalds, with that of 
the Cameron of LoCheiL The 79th 
Camerons wore oui tartan in for
eign service in Flanders, and the 
West Indies during the'Eighteenth 
Century.
When the Kiltie Band wanted 
uniforms they sent to Scotland and 
obtained uniforms made of the 
authentic Cameron of Erracht tar
tan. Incidently the blaiiket-like 
mantle over the shoulder is called 
the Plaid the skirt is called th* 
Kiltie, and the Whisk broom*' 
hanging in front is the Sporran.
As a style note it may be remark
ed that the Highlanders considered 
it amatk of shame or effeminacy to 
wear trousers during the period 
after th Jacobite Rebellion of 1745,. 
whn the use of tartans was sup
pressed by an act of Parliament.
W wouldn't be  bit Surprised to 
hear the Kiltie Band, when swing
ing along in th traditional garb of 
the 79th Highlanders to suddenly 
shout their bloodcurdling war cry, 
Darag dearca fitchich!or some
thing.
Students May Join 
Artists For Victory 
To Aid In War Effort
Aestheticaly-minded Tech stutieiits may now have the opportun
ity to do something for the war ef-f6tt. Artists for Victory, Incorpor
ated, a new society recently Organ
ized in Pittsburgh is interested in 
securing enthusiastic students as 
members. All students interested 
in applying for membership should 
see Clarence Carter in the. P. & D. 
Department.
Artists for Victory, Incorporated, 
is composed of all the art organiza
tions in the city. It was formed so 
that all art work, pertaining to the 
war effort, be it literature, music, 
painting, sculpture, drama, or ar
chitecture, might be centralized.
Many members of the faculty of 
Carnegie Tech are active in the or
ganization. Clarence Carter, in
structor in painting, is president. 
Raymond Simboli of the Architec
ture Department is vice-president. 
Gladys Schmitt, English Depart
ment, Samuel Rosenbert, Painting 
and Design Department, Bob Lepper, Painting and Design Depart
ment, J. B. Ellis, Sculpture Depart
ment, and Margaret Schneider, 
Drama Department, head commit
tees on literature, painting, poster, 
sculpture, and dance, respectively.
So far, Artists For Victory has 
been busy getting organized. How
ever, it has plans to make posters 
pertaining to the war effort, using 
local subject material and sugges
tions from the Office of War Infor
mation in Washington. It will give 
art books and mazaines to army 
camps for those soldiers interested 
in keeping in touch with the art 
world. The organization also plans 
to sponsor exhibits, the proceeds of 
which will be given to war activi
ties. The biggest project that Art
ists For Victory is planning is a 
masque which will be held in the 
spring.
College Training 
Useful To WAACS
Although the Womens Army 
Auxiliary Corps has no specific ed
ucational requirements, WAAC of
ficials report that college training 
often produces the quality of leader
ship that the Corps is seeking in its 
officers.
The first 436 WAAC officers were 
commissioned directly from civilian 
life to tfriri incoming members of 
the Corps, but in th future all of
ficers will be promoted from the 
ranks.
The ranks of the Vif AAC are open 
to all women between the ages of 21 
and 45, regardless of race, color and 
creed, Mrs. Ovta Culp Hobby, Di
rector of the Corps says. Physical 
fitness and mental alertness are the 
chief requirements. No social or 
educational barriers stand in the 
way of a womans serving her coun
try in the WAAC.
A WAAC must be a citizen of tho 
United States and have a good rec
ord in her home community. She 
must pass the WAAC "mental alert

for the familiar faces and places he

Hell be thinking of that rollick

the Mens Glee Club during the 
spring of his junior year. Hell re
member, too, those intramural box
ing bouts with scrappy A1 Mura. 
Never to be forgotten will be those 
five days and nights spent with his 
Omicron Delta Kappa brothers 
working on decorations and pub
licity to make the Fall Carnival of 
1942 a success.
As vice president of Pi Delta Ep
silon, the men's journalistic honor
ary, Walt feels that this organiza
tion could be a much more potent 
force in campus publications than it 
now is. His devotion to C. I. T. pub
lications arises from his active par
ticipation on virtually all of them. 
He has contributed his talents and 
his time mainly to the Tartan as comanaging editor. He was layout 
and design editor of both the Tech
nical and the Cut during his junior 
year, and during his freshman and 
sophomore years he was associate 
editor of the Citcommcntator. Of 
late he has been contributing fre
quent articles to the Scottie and 
the Thistle.
But Walter is proudest of the fact 
that he has earned all his school ex
penses in his four years at Tech 
through either scholarships or a 
varied assortment of odd jobs. One 
of his various jobs included living a 
month at Whitfield Hall, an experi
ence which no other male student 
on campus can claim.

In step with the times, Dave is a 
super patriot. Not satisfied with 
giving his blood to the effort, short
ly after graduation in December, 
Dave will leave for Chanute Field 
to enter the Air Corps as an Engi

of Pi Tau Sigma, National Mechan

Dave hails from a small town in 
Ohio which possibly explains his 
fear of the weaker sex. He says its 
only because he cant get a date

As far as he is concerned, his most 
worthwhile accomplishment in his 
short life as a student, aside from

PRE-MILITARY TRAINING 
for MEN ol MILITARY AGE
Volo.o36 TRAmma
The Department of Civil Engi
neering of Qamegie Tech has the 
distinction of being the first in the 
country to initiate the program of 
having senior theses which are 
based on experiments sponsored by 
commercial companies. These spon
sors, besides providing the supplies 
necessary for conducting the ex
periments, give a bonus of $50 to 
those students working on the proj
ects.
Research work conducted by se
lected senior engineers is designed 
to offer solutions to minor industrial 
problems resulting from the short
age of metals^ from failures in ma
chine parts due to fatigue, and var
ious other difficulties encountered 
in many plant: organizations.
Three senior civil engineers are 
now working; on these sponsored 
theses. Robert E. Linder and Harry 
M. Sadler are experimenting on a 
composite slab of reinforced con
crete 'made of plywood, concrete, 
and a small j&nount of steel shear 
developers rather than steel and 
concrete, as steel is vitally needed 
in war industries. Through this 
achievement, only about two per 
cent of the steel ordinarily used in 
the production of reinforced con
crete is needed.: Weight will be put 
on this slab .to test it, and the ef
fects of temperatures on this new 
combination will be studied. Thus 
the new combination of plywood 
and concrete, if successful, will 
have many practical applications; it 
may be used for service piers, 
bridge floors, and floors in buildings.
The companies backing this ex
periment are the American. Wood 
Preservers Association, from Chica
go, who will supply, the shear de
velopers, $50 for one of the students, 
and an additional grant of $50for 
the purchase of necessary supplies; 
and the Hal Keely Plywood Com
pany, who will furnish' the ply
wood and who will match the mone
tary grants made by the other com
pany. . These establishments are 
taking an interest in this research 
because they wish to advance their 
own products.
Working on the production of 
white concrete.-.from lime and plain 
concrete, as the manufacture of 
white concrete .itself is very expen
sive and has been curtailed since 
the outbreak ofthe war, is Ben 
Marcin. This mixture can be of 
great value in directional curbings 
in airports and along the assembly 
lines of airplane factories. With the 
use of this cheaper white concrete, 
light can be reflected well where it 
is most needed.
The National Lime Association of 
Washington, D. C., is supplying the 
financial bonus and the raw ma
terials needed to conduct the re
search.
A plan such as this should be a 
stimulant to students inasmuch as 
it will yield results which have a di
rect bearing on .the students train
ing and which furnish them with 
valuable practical experience, in
dustrial contacts, and a small fi
nancial return in the form of an 
award. "While it is not very prob
able that extremely important and 
deeply involved research problems 
might be solved through this prac
tice, nevertheless, the cooperating 
industry which has few facilities for 
organized research should find 
much benefit from such a program. 
Perhaps this good idea will spread 
to other departments and other 
schools.
Originator of this plan for senior 
industrial research theses is C. W. 
Muhlenbruch, assistant professor of 
civil engineering. A graduate of 
the University of Illinois, he work
ed at the Aluminum Research Lab
oratory at New Kensington before 
coming to Tech. He has been here 
for four years, and, has contributed 
many valuable articles to technical 
magazines. Last spring many com
panies became interested in his plan 
for plywood girders.

New System Offers 
Sleepless Lectures
By Allen Golden -
Professor Hawkes of Columbia 
University has suggested a solution 
for the everlasting problem of bor
ing lectures. By employing the 
Hawkes System any tired student 
can appear to be wide awake and 
vitally interested in the dissertation 
that he is forced to listen to.
As soon as the lecturer begins ad
ministering his anaesthetic, the stu
dent should listen for a word begin
ning with the letter a. When this 
word is found, the already thrilled 
listener keeps on his toes so that he 
will not miss the "b word, and so 
on through the alphabet. The 
chances of coming across q, x," 
orz are very slim; but this only 
adds to the joy of the game. If a 
player is lucky, he will get through 
the entire alphabet. When he does, 
he wins!
Professor Hawkes is certain , that 
the system works because he has 
experimented with it. Upon first 
inventing the game he described it 
to all of his students. Since that 
time he. has been able to announce 
a greatly increased attendance at 
his lectures; and he also claims that 
when he leaves the room at the end 
of the period, there are no sleeping 
beauties continuing their beauty 
naps into the next period.
As a student, I can vouch for the 
efficiency of the I^awkes system, 
and suggest that the Student Coun
cil give him a vote, of thanks.
(Ed note: We guarantee, Profes
sor Hawkes, that your future class
es will not only be more wide 
awake, but also considerably larger 
if youll try serving tea and crum
pets between p and q.)

The Time When The Horse Reigned 
Supreme On The Carnegie Campus
By BUI Kolb
Students and faculty alike are 
worried about Techs future in the 
light of the present shortages and 
curiosity has been aroused as to 
what a car-less Carnegie would 
be like: We went to Mr. J. C. Bur
ry,' the purchasing agent, one of the 
real old timers, to get a brief 
sketch of Tech as he knew it and 
may probably know it again.
The above photo is one of his 
prize possessions and should give 
you some idea of what conditions 
could be like without cars. It pic
tures the first president, Arthur A. 
Hamerschlag, on his return from 
abroad, with Anna B. Smith, first 
dean of Margaret Morrison, and Ed' 
gar Leippe, the president of the sen
ior class. Note the joyous students 
welcoming their president, who 
rides not in a four gallon a mile 
Packard, but a horse drawn car
riage.
Mr. Burry recalls this and many 
other incidents when the horse 
reigned supreme. It seems that the '

lar bam about one hundred feet 
long, stationed where the flagpole 
now stands in front of the Arts 
Building. Can you imagine horses 
stabled in the Commons, where you 
now eat your daily bread?
Transportation to school for most 
students meant a street-car that 
stopped at the Carnegie Library, for 
the only available entrance was 
across the bridge to Schenley Park.
Now we must prove if we are 
physically superior to men of the 
past as we claim. You may be sure, 
however, that the students of those 
days did not weaken under what we 
would now consider hardships.

Family Album, Best of Plays; 
Other Two Have Mediocre Success
The Drama department's latest 
presentation was an interesting, 
and, we imagine, a very difficult ex
periment; three one-act plays by to
days master of froth and sophisti
cated nonsense, Noel Coward. Mr. 
Coward produced these plays in 
New York a few years ago with 
himself and Gertrude Lawrence in 
the leading roles, and we could not 
help but wonder, as we watched all 
three, how Mr; Coward and the al
ways delightful Jenny did them. 
It struck us, as the lights came up, 
at complete wordliness, a rare 
quality in matured men and wo
men, is almost too much to expect 
of young actors, no matter how ex
cellent they may be, and no amount 
of vocal tricks and poise can catch 
that elusive omniscience which Mr. 
Coward instills in his work.
This was most evident in the first 
play, "Hands Across the Sea, an 
airy little nonentity about a charm
ingly scatter-brained woman and 
one incident in her very confused 
life. Piggie, the central character, 
whose every word and action cried 
out for Gertrude Lawrence, was 
competently ihterperated by Miss 
Walker, though she,' like all the 
members of casts, was inclined to 
speak a little rapidly. Mr. and Mrs. 
Wadhurst, country cousins with a 
vengence, were treated to a su
perabundance of proviniciability by 
Mr. Motyl and Miss Gerson respec
tively. Strange interperatations 
were Miss Sheinmans as Clare, and 
Mr. Knaaks as Mr. Bumham, whom 
wc would never trust with his own 
knife and fork, let alone the plans 
for a motorboat. Excellent in a 
small part was Mr. Krantz as Bogie. 
The set, attractive, no doubt, on pa
per, suffered under a welter of in
congruous properties. Summary: 
though it may have been written 
like champagne, both of Techs casts 
played it like gin.
The second play, "Still Life, dis
played Mr. Coward's capacity for 
that sordid type of romanticism
which isor was, before the war: 
the bane of those who go to-the the
ater to be entertained. We found, 
it a trifle dull and drawn out, and 
focused our attention on the com
edy which revolved around the 
counter upstage. Mr. Stevens was 
a plausible Albert, and Mr. Agruss 
an exuberent and cheeky Stanley. 
Miss Pursch and Miss Dodge had al
most identical interperatations of 
Mrs. Bagot, though Miss Dodge 
looked more like a bar-maid, which 
may or may not be a compliment. 
The love interest, a heavy business 
at best, was handled competently 
by Miss Layton and Mr. Sivy, less 
so by Miss Roth and Mr. Rose. The 
audience was spared a very ordi
nary parting scene by the entrance 
of a garrulous creature named 
Dolly, whose extreme rudeness 
broke up a dangerously sentimental 
plot and inspired Miss Roth to near 
hysteria. Perfectly matched, we 
thought, were Miss Nelson as the 
free and easy barmaid, and Mr. 
Agruss, whom we have mentioned 
before.
We were so entranced by the 
third play, Family Album/' that 
we find it difficult to remember any 
especially brilliant fragment from 
that kaleiscopic Fantasy With 
Music. The set was excellent, and 
a perfect foil for the black costumes. 
The acting and singing were far 
above average, as was the music, 
especially the little tune about 
somebody* marrying a sailor or 
something. Outstanding was Miss 
Law as Jane with a wonderful, clear 
voice, and a strange sort of intimate 
dignity. Very successful, also, were 
Miss Strober as Lavinia and Mr. 
Parks as Jasper. Though the sup
porting characters had but negligi
ble parts, they were handled with 
assurance and ease. The whole 
performance, from the opening tab
leau to the final line downstage, re
minded us of the stylized technique 
of the older Russian Ballets.

Two Men Win Out 
In Tough Fight
Several w-eeks ago th Tartan 
startled the campus by clearing up 
che enigma Of T T B T that had been 
baffling the campus for days. Once 
again this publication. brings the 
news of the moment with the re
sults of that much talked of bridge 
tournament.
After a final round of 24 hands of 
semi-duplicate bridge the winners, 
and best players. On Tech campus 
are proclaimed to be John Klein 
and Al McKling, Running a close 
second and fighting to the end on 
November 11, were Bob Sterling 
and Irving Palfsky. Others who 
placed - in the tournament were 
Adolph Slone and Sidney Berkowitz, who took third position, 
while Richard Armstrong and Rich 
ard Russell placed fourth.
It seems as though the men have 
once again asserted .their superior
ity. Although the tournament began 
with ten teams of men and ten of 
women, none of the womens teams 
survived to the finals. Two of their 
teams, composed of Barbara Lind 
strom and Ruth Borgman, Lucy 
Frank and Phyllis Tesler, playeain 
the semi-finals, but were eliminated.
Klein and McKling were leading 
throughout but it was a tough fight. 
Theta Tau came through with their 
ten to one promise by awarding the 
top team a prize of ten dollars, 
while the boys that-placed second 
pocketd a five dollar second prize.
The consolation tournament for 
those teams eliminated in the first 
play off was completed last Thurs
day night when Mr. and Mrs. Jack 
L. Bowers won the booby prize from 
the competing team of Stanley

OUR FOUNDER
Carnegie, Benefactor Extraordinary, Founds 
Institution With Million Dollar Endowment
Long before 1900 Andrew Carne
gie visualized an institution to fur
nish trained men to industrial 
America, but the idea did not crys
tallize until after he visited Heighley Institute in September ofthat 
year. On November 15, 1900, the 
trustees of the Carnegie Institute 
held a banquet at the Schenley Ho
tel in honor of our founder, and at 
the banquet Mr. Carnegie read a 
letter in which he announced a gift 
of one million dollars for the en
dowment fund of a technical school. 
Carnegie Institute of Technology 
was bora.
Five hard years followed, during 
which the site was selected, the 
ground broken; plans drawn up; In
dustries Hallour first building 
was raised, and Arthur Hammerschlag was appointed director. The 
charter class of 1908, 120 strong, en
tered Carnegie Tech on October 16, 
1905.
Amid the hammering, riveting, 
and sawing attendent on construc
tion, the first classes were held, and 
many of our traditions established. 
The Tartan and Thistle were organ
ized, the first fraternity formed, the 
school colors chosen, and the first 
athletic head appointed. Women 
came to Carnegie in March, 1906, 
and attended clases in Industries 
Hall
In September, 1907, the women 
moved into the newly-built Mar
garet Momson Carnegie College,

Below: Andrew Carnegxe leaving his c
and an era of rapid expansion be
gan. Classes were first held in En
gineering Hall in 1S03; the Pine Arts 
Building was finished in 1912, and 
its two wings added in 1916. Also 
in 1912, Machinery Hall had its 
humble beginning in the form of a 
lowly, one-story power house. Ad
ministration Hall was added in 1914. 
The latest important addition was 
made in 1924 when the gymnasium 
was built. Between 1914 and 1924 
the mens dorms and the Commons 
(the latter was then called the 
Langley Aeronautical Laboratory) 
were added to the campus.
During this period, the courses 
were expanded to cover four years 
and were placed on a collegiate 
basis. In 1912 the quality of instruc
tion and material warranted a 
charter of incorporation and Car
negie Tech received the power to 
confer degrees. The name was 
changed from Carnegie Technical 
Schools to its present name. The 
school grew so that, during the 
World War, about 10,000 people 
were trained here. By the end of 
the war, 3,600 soldiers and civilians 
were under training on campus.
August 11, 1919, was a sad day 
for Tech, for on that date Andrew 
Carnegie died. He had visited the 
school five times and was known 
and loved by both faculty and stu
dents.
By this time the school had 
grown so that the Carnegie Corpor
ation agreed to grant $8,000,000 to 
the school in 1946, if Tech could raise 
$4,000,000. This was for making 
some desired changes on the campus 
for which funds were inadequate.
Dunng Dr. Bakers administra
tion a series of international con
ferences brought some of the 
world s outstanding scientists to 
Tech. Also during his career here, 
the College of Industries was con
solidated into Engineering, and 
Tech became the only school m the 
country to confer degrees in print
ing.
In September. 1935, Dr. Baker re
tired due to ill health, and Dr. Dohertv. our present executive, suc
ceeded him m Marcn. 1936.

twist has been added. Instead of 
just sliding back to the ground, one 
will slide down only six feet and 
land on a platform. The eight-foot 
jump from the platform constitutes 
obstacle number two.
Next on the program is a sprint 
over the four terraces which will 
bring the runners up to the Cut. 
Here they will be confronted by a 
checkerboard, a series of short 
jumps that is designed for knee 
action. The next feature on the 
program is called a "Dodge." After 
going through another Jungle-Jim, 
one arrives at Forbes Street and the 
start of the 100-yard course.
This course, which is short but 
snappy, includes the following 
closely-spaced obstacles: a two and 
one-half foot hurdle; a four-foot 
fence; two feet of high dodges; a 
seven-foot wall; a two-foot crawlunder; a very special jump over a 
seven and one-half foot ditch that 
will be filled with water; and a bal
ance that will be 32 feet long and 
two feet high.
After the runners finish up the 
military course, they will run down 
to the tennis courts; near the ropeclimb, where they will walk 
through a 15-foot V shaped trough 
called a straddle. There is still a 
dash back down and around the 
track to the original starting point!
As one of the enthusiastic build
ers exclaimed, If they took all of 
the obstacles out theyed still have 
a terrific course. This place is a 
natural!

A Brief Moment With Gertie

Miss Lawrence had heard that the 
Drama Department was presenting 
Tonight at 8:30 and wanted to see 
the shows. There wasnt time, of 
course (I believe there was a Red 
Cross meeting, a speech at the Mo
bile Unit, and a dinner engagement 
for our matinee afternoon) but she 
read some of the lines and groping
ly hummed some of the music.
About this time John Potter, pro
duction manager, and Darling, 
came knocking at the door.
Step right up, ladies and gentle
men, for the greatest show on cam
pusthe fight of the ages, the blitz 
of all blitzesCarnegie Tech's own 
Senior Ducking! Come right up 
and see all the sights! On one side 
we see the seniors barricading the 
top floor of McGill Hall, and on an
other the underclassmen forming 
for an assault. The air raid sirens 
(or reasonable vocal facsimiles) 
scream while water bombs pound 
the aggressors as they stand around 
the entrance to Boss Hall. Now we 
see the assault on a solid wall of 
seniors inside McGill Hall, water 
splashing liberally over the attack
ers. What is it all about? Well, la
dies and gentlemen, just read on to 
find out.
Midnight last Wednesday was set 
as the time for Senior Ducking, but 
the seniors got wind of the fact that 
it was coming off and joined forces 
on the top floor of McGill Hall. A 
little later, the underclassmen as
sembled spontaneously (about an 
hour and a half before midnight) to 
start the big brawl early.
One underclassman was trying to 
delay the fracas until the next night 
(Thursday) because the seniors 
seemed too well fixed, and heavy 
damage seemed imminent. There 
was a rumor that the seniors had 
piled up desks and chairs to effect 
the barricade, so, one by one, about 
four or five men went over to see 
for themselves. Just as your re
porter got a gJimpse showing that
the rumor was false, he was nearly 
trampled by the rush of underclass
men, who attacked a solid wall of 
seniors on the landing between the 
second and third floors. Water cas
caded down over the attackers and 
stairs, and the struggle beganone 
senior was grabbed from the multi
tude and tumbled down the stain. 
Water began to come incessantly as, 
one by one, the seniors bounced 
merrily down the steps, with from 
one to four underclassmen hanging, 
onto each of them.
Outdoors, the seniors were forced 
to the ground and hog-tied, then, 
carried into Boss clubroom, where 
inventory was taken. Among them 
was a Judas, a Benedict Arnold, a 
traitor. It was Ted Nierenberg, 
Business Editor of the Tartan, who 
was to get his with the rest.
Into the bowl went the procession 
that foggy night. There the seniors 
were herded together and a hose 
played on them until someone let 
a couple of them loose. Amid the 
shouts and fog, a black blob cut 
through the air and struck home 
with a splat! Mud-balls! And so, 
the dorm politicians got in practice 
with a little (?) mud-slinging. Those 
that didnt get mud in the eye fell 
and got it all over them.
One last note: contrary to the 
rumor around campus, McGill Hall 
did not float off and go down the 
Ohio River as a result of the inci
dentand the moral is Stop That 
Rumor!

Electrical Honorary 
Calls New Members
Last night. Eta Kappa Nu, the 
Electrical Honorary, held their an
nual initiation banquet in the Hotel 
Webster Hall. Eight juniors of the 
E. E. department officially entered 
the society after a ritual that after
noon in the club room of Machinery, 
Hall. They were: Leslie S. Frost, 
Robert W. Pogue, George Gallousis, 
Mannis ,E. Neumann, William H.; 
Shepard, Charles N. Goehring, Mil
ton D* Daniels'and Carl R. Olson.
Leadership, : personality, activi
ties, and scholarship, are the re
quirements by which the above men 
were selected. This year there are 
fifteen seniors in E. K. N. out of a 
class of forty-four. This represents 
an exceptionally high percentage of 
honor students for this class.
Professor Raymond T. Gabler, a 
member of the faculty, was also re
ceived into the organization in rec
ognition of his excellent work in 
this department.
Colonel George Fairley, Director 
of Public Safety of the city of Pitts
burgh, was the guest speaker at the 
banquet. The Colonel spoke to the 
entire group of twenty-three stu
dents and six faculty members and 
gave an interesting account of his 
many experiences in the field of 
electricity here and abroad.

Adolphs mountain hideout all be
cause you had given your last silk 
stocking to the cause?
The Household Economics De

to the government. If you can 
spare a torn old stocking or three, 
just walk it up to the third floor and

The Editor 
Carnegie Tartan 
Dear Sir:
A few months ago, when I reviewed^the first play, I was a little 
conceited by the way in which the 
Drama Department, both faculty 
and students, received the opinions 
of one so untutored in the ways of 
the theater; they apparently believe 
that it'is th perogative of their de
partment, and their department 
alone,' to comment publicly on their 
own handiwork. C^iven as the 
drama students are to hyperbole, 
their tales, taken at half face value, 
indicated that their faculty was 
prostrate with rage. The students 
themselves, assuming that the inter
loper had no knowledge of the intri
cacies of acting, designed to take lit
tle notice of the Tartans latest col
umn, save to read each review sol* 
emnly and without comment; with
out comment, that is, within ear
shot of either myself or those who

.  . Oh Dramats
could report to me.
Granted I have no knowledge 
of the aforementioned intricacies, 
wouldnt that be more of a help than 
a hindrance? I know nothing of stage 
composition or movement or all 
those technical subtleties which are 
lost to the layman, but I am enter
tained, or not, as the case may be, 
as a layman, and rnot as one of the 
initiated. In the past, the reviews 
were confined, as far as I can gather, 
to clucks of praise for the more tal
ented, and a kind word for the 
weak. I realize that not all 6f the 
performances, can be of a profession
al calibre, that the actors are still 
students, but, eveii as students they 
are outstanding, acceptable, or poor. 
A play must be judged as a whole, 
one player contrasted to or compar
er with another, the merits of one 
and the faults of the other discuss
ed; isnt that the purpose of a re
view? That has been my policy and 
will continue to be as long as I am 
writing for the Tartan.
I weary of this incognito, and I 
think the cloak of mystery wears a 
trifle thin; when I dispense with it, 
it will be of my own volition, and 
not through the efforts of those who 
said that J. B. could be forced to re
veal his identity.
Truly Yours,
J. B.

Recital Will Feature 
Gloria Siegles Rondo
Students in the Department of 
Music will present their second re
cital of the season on Sunday, De
cember 6, in the Exhibition Room, 
Arts, at 8:15 P. M. The program to 
be presented will be a varied one 
featuring both piano and voice se
lections.
One of the numbers to be per
formed will be an original composi
tion by Gloria Siegle, a senior piano 
major. This talented musician has 
written a wealth of material, among 
which have been many popular 
songs for Scotch and Soda produc
tions. Her latest work, which she 
will play, is written.in the modem 
idiom but adheres strictly to the 
first rondo form.
As Dr. J. Vick OBrien, head of 
the Music Department, said, It is 
modem yet musicala proof that 
such music can exist and still have 
form. The concert is open to the 
public; no tickets of admittance will 
be required.

Maxie has been married for many

Maxie matriculated before entering

Maxies whole life has been cen

occupation, athletics. This inter

played football, basketball, and 
baseball. At the time he was learn
ing to play basketball, an incident 
occurred which is still remembered 
in Crafton. During a practice, the 
coach told Maxie always to shoot 
the ball for the nearest basket when 
he received it This was all very 
logical, since he played forward. 
However, when Crafton High met 
their first opponents of the season, 
Maxie was suddenly shifted to 
guard. On the touch-off the ball 
was tipped to Maxie who faithfully 
carried out instructions and made a 
superb shot which cleared the loop

wrote for the Pitt Weekly and from 
his freshman year to the time he 
came to Tech was associated with 
the Pittsburgh Press. Max worked 
up to the post of Assistant Sports

Basketball has been Maxie's

championship, once in 1935, and 
again in 1939, the last year of the 
Conference. However, Maxie is not

Skibo Cagers Victors 
Against Westinghouse
Whipping into shape for. their 
first game two weeks from this Fri
day, the Carnegie basketballers 
trounced the Westinghouse Appren
tices 46-32 in a practice encounter 
last Friday.
Led by sophomore George Marck, 
who garnered fourteen points, the 
Tech outfit spurted early in the 
third quarter and coasted to record 
the win. High man for the losers 
was Menase with four buckets and 
two foul tosses for his total of ten 
points. Coach Hannum started 
Showman and Marck as forwards, 
Brinn at center, Harry Smith and 
DeBortoli on the guard posts.
Westinghouse stopped this team 
with a tight zone defense and led at 
half time by 23-18. Unable to pen
etrate the zone Tech was forced to 
play conservatively throughout the 
entire first two periods.
When the East Pittsburgh switch
ed to a man-for-man defense, 
early in the third quarter, Tech 
moved in fast and proceded to put 
the game on ice. With Showman 
and Brinn setting the pace, via the 
old pass and break, Tech outscored the opponents 1 to 5 in this setup. 
At this point, Hannum rushed Sher
man, Meyer, Kelly and Culbertson 
into the fray; they gathered four
teen points in lightning fashion 
while the weary Apprentices pick
ed up a meager four. The final 
count listed Tech on a long end of a 
46 to 32 score.
This practice game revealed 
many things for future reference: 
Marcks uncanny shooting from all 
angles; Smith and DeBortolis long 
Tange "swishes; Showman and 
Brinn controlling both backboards 
as well as their stalwart offensive 
play; the racehorse speed of the 
second team plus its scrappy fight.

An Editorial
Athletic Trends At Tech
By Don Watkins, Sports ditor 
To those of us who have been here at Tech for the four years since. 
1939, sports have gone through a rather marked transition. We have' seen - 
the emphasis go from varsity sports to intramural athletics and other, minor -.%j 
forms of athletic endeavor such as soccer, track, cross country^- swimming/ 
and even boxing. This has been notable due to the fact that immediately. 
previous to 1939 the most popular of all varsity athletics, football,, enjoy* 
ed a prime place in the attention of Carnegie students and offered much 
diversion to residents of Pittsburgh, a great many of whom were loyal fans ; 
of the Skibo grid squad.
What Causd This Change? r~
The transition which we have mentioned occurred very rapidly, and it ' . 
was with great dislike that many of the students watched it take place. 
Arguments such as: We aren't getting our moneys worth; It isnt good= 
publicity for the school; and Its nothing but a grind school, were voiced 
from a howling mob of dissatisfied students.
Nevertheless, the inexorable hand of the administration continued to 
change until our football and basketball teams drew only students and 
not-so-proud parents of the members of. the team. Athletic scholarships 
were withdrawn along with the incentive foragood players to attend Tech.
 1939, 1940, and 1941 proved to be gloomy years in the Carnegie sports an
nals. The various-teams were the laughing stock of outside followers of - - 
Skibo athletics and even the students themselves joined in the derisive cry. v 
School spirit, wihch seems to be inevitably tied up to athletic prowess,  
went from a deafening roar to a dead silence. Frequent exhortations from 
zealous members of the student body proved to little avail the condition of 
Tech sports and athletic interest. The whole situation developed into a 
vicious circle which got worse and worse and reached its climax m the 
basketball season of 40-41 when the hoopsters lost every encounter Gf the 
entire circuit. The losing strealc started by the team that year was earned. . . 
well into the next season, but the jinx was finally broken and. things beh 
gan to look up. Since that time, although the newspapers still like to use 
the Carnegie teams as victims of their satire, the athletic outlook has / > 
brightened until this year when Tech spirit was brought to a new high for 
recent seasons.
The Brighter Side
So far the picture has been one of almost total darkness. A great deal 
of good has resulted from this ostensibly sad transition. This good has 
been exemplified in the greatly increased interest in intramurals. The total 
adds up to a better sports world for Tech, especially in view of the recent 
swing back to a more normal athletic program:
The promotion of intramurals and theminor varsity athletics hassled 
to the inevitable conclusion of greatly increased participation in athletics.
A great number of students left their customary positions on the sidelines 
and transferred their pleasure from the vicarious to the actual This 
change answers many of the objections raised at the time the de^emphasizThe school did not turn into a grind institution nor.ing program began.
had a taste of this rugged game will did the students fail to get their money's worth,
be better equipped to serve the The Balance
Our belief is that the varsity side deserves a stronger position than it
now enjoys, but this should not take place at the expense of ^ the gains
made in other departments. Carnegie Tech should not allow its name to, be 
connected with scholastic enterprise alone, but should take its place with 
any other universities in the athletic world. This can only be done by 
boosting the varsity standing of the school. We dont want teams that will 
compare with the Big Ten squads, but we mould like to see our organiza
tions go into games as favorites instead of being eternally the underdogs.
country. And when the time comes 
to face the enemy, the often called 
"dumb football player will not be 
heading any retreats.
Thus, since it is obvious that foot
ball aids in our war effort,, the ad
vantages should be well considered 
by the school's officials before any 
steps to abolish it are taken.

Don Palmers Orchestra To Play 
For Evening Council Dance Nov. 28
Defense Bond To Be 
Given As Door Prize
Evening Student Council has an
nounced the date of the Annual 
Thanksgiving Dance as November 
28th. This affair has become a tra
dition with the evening students of 
Carnegie Tech and is looked for
ward to with great anticipation by 
all who have had the opportunity 
of attending one.
No effort is spared by Council in

to get his degree, for hes been com

The Carnegie Plaid
this years choice, we believe, will 
meet with the approval of all interchestra will give out with its 
unique style of sweet swing music,
of the trombone player. Don Pal
mer is well known to the dancing 
crowd which frequents the Pitts
burgh hotels and nearby country 
clubs and he is also no stranger to 
those of us on Carnegie Tech cam
pus as he has played for the last 
three Christmas Dances held by the 
Evening College of Engineering.
It has been decided by Council 
that instead of presenting corsages 
to the attending ladies, as has been 
the custom of many previous dances, 
a $25.00 defense bond will be award
ed to the holders of the lucky num
ber, and it is hoped that, in addiwill be that extra added attrac
tion which will bring out the 
crowd.
Thistle Hall is the scene set for 
this dance and, of course, the much 
discussed and well remembered 
crystal ball will be much in evi
dence to lend its brilliance in creat
ing an air of romance and mystery.
Of course, you all know that this

admission charge is to be $1.10 per 
couple, but the cost is a small item 
when, judging by past affairs, such 
a good time is anticipated. Show

celebration.

will be able to get back into, the 
swing of things. Now dont get us 
wrong, Friday nights are more fun 
than a circus, and we are sure you 
have all been to. the circus at least 
once.
You see, thi6 is Thanksgiving va
cation so we are going to lay off. 
That means no school Thursday, 
Friday, and Saturday.
The Plaid will be published on 
December 8 in its distinctive style.

things, the Oboe.
He spends his forty hours a week 
at the Irvin plant of the Carnegie Il
linois Steel Corporation, where he 
is the metallurgist working on tin 
mill complaints.
On campus this year he holds two 
important positionsnamely. Treas
urer of the Evening School of Engi
neering, and Chairman of the Stu
dent Council Social Committee. At 
the moment hes wracking his brain 
over turkey-less dance decorations 
for the Thanksgiving Dance (plug.)
For two consecutive years he has 
won insignia awards and last year 
he won the Activity Scholarship for 
the Engineering School.
On the distaff side, he enjoys 
dancing, but strictly in the style of 
Guy Lombardo or some similiar 
smoothie. Bowling and swimming, 
his favorite sports, also take up a 
good bit of his time, when hes not 
at the Greeks.
Incidentally, in case you didnt 
know, his name is Al Flanders.
Handbooks Gather Dust

All that fuss about not having the 
handbooks at the time of registra
tion, and the handbooks are still sit
ting around waiting for the stu
dents to come and get them.
Maybe some of you students have 
never seen a handbook. You know 
they really should be called Handi-books 'cause they answer more 
purposes than enough. Engineers, 
they are a perfect place to keep 
those phone numbers. By looking 
in the handbook you can see just 
when anything is going to happen 
that iswhen and if it ever does.

Space did not permit my answer
ing the letters printed in previous 
issues at the time they were pub
lished. The following should take 
car of the suggestion printed in 
the November 10 mite.
Evening Student Council has un
der consideration a plan whereby 
the Colleges of Fine Arts and In
dustries, in the event they have 
no eligible students when the final 
check is made this week, may be 
represented at Council Meetings.
The representatives, chosen from 
the active students in each eollege 
will be invited to sit in on the meet
ing and voice their opinions, but 
will not have the power to vote.
In fairness to all, and in oYd6r 
that Council may function with the 
support of all colleges, I believe this 
the only solution to the problem at 
hand.
As suggested, in a recent letter 
"To the Editor, to lower the stand
ards of eligibility, would be, in my 
opinion, contrary to the purpose of 
the organization. Council is, and 
should be, composed of ACTIVE 
students from the campus. There
fore, the one rule which must not 
change, and which is "gumming up 
the works" is that which states a 
student must have earned an Insig
nia Award.
There are many active students 
who should be considered to rep
resent their college and it is guar
anteed they will be selected through 
merit, only.

The Carnegie Union, perhaps the 
most delightful building on the cam
pus is the least used. The splendid 
facilities for an evenings entertain
ment include everything from pi' 
anos to ping pong tables. The hand
book, on page 65, lists these facilities in detail.
The students of Industries, Arts, 
Margaret Morrison, and Engineer
ing are encouraged to make use of 
this haven to further their enjoy
ment of campus life. Just as "all 
work and no play makes Jack (or 
Jessie) a dull boy (or skirt), the 
rigorous routine of working, school
ing, studying, and sleeping off the 
effects, is too taxing if no relaxa
tion such as the Union affords, is 
enjoyed. Lets say we all come., out 
and enjoy the above mentioned 
delights and were sure you .will 
find the fellowship enjoyed well 
worth the time spent. You will.flnd
