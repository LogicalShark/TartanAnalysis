Class Thespians Nearing the 
Peak, to Defend Honors in 
Cup Competition
Tag sales start today for the 
Science Stag to be held in the Car
negie Union, Saturday, December 12 
at 7:30. The program is almost com
pleted and ambitious class play
wrights and Thespians are rapidly 
reaching perfection for the spirited 
competition which, has as its reward 
the traditional silver trophy.
Novel favors, unique programs, 
talented speakers, hilarious stunts, 
interesting movies, enticing music, 
refreshments heavy with calories and 
vitamines served in true' Commons 
style and smokes are a few of the 
many events which the committee 
has prepared to make this annual 
smoker frolic of the Engineering Col
lege the snappiest nicotine fest on 
record.
Sample Ballots will be posted for 
the Popularity Contest, in which all 
shrinking violet heroes who have 
heretofore concealed their admirable 
characteristics behind the cloak of 
humility will be rewarded by their 
fellow students with prizes signifying 
the particular field in which they 
have gained fame. Some of the classi
fications on which the votes will be 
taken are the biggest bluffer (points 
of qaulity a requisite), most ladylike 
(engineers only are eligible), best 
dancer (Oh Charleston, my Charles
ton), wisest cracker (monkeying with 
pokes is funny business), and biggest 
crab (faculty excluded). It is the In
tention of those in charge of the con
test that the sample ballots should 
be inspected and. that when the bal
lots are given out at the next Assem
bly will be ready to cast his vote to 
send some deserving hero on into the 
Science Stag Hall of Fame.
In other years the stag was a fourcylinder affair and everything was 
considered alright if the four classes 
produced their skits, but this year It 
will be hitting on all six, with the

COMMITTEE CHOSEN 
FOR WOMENS PROM
Subsidiary Committee Will 
Investigate Ways of 
Lowering Price
FEBRUARY 26 IS DATE
The members of the committee for 
the Womens Junior Prom has been 
chosen' and the committee lias started 
work on the plans for the big event 
of their Junior year scheduled for tho 
night of February 26. No definite 
plans have been made as yet but the 
girls are very ambitious.
The committee consists of six girls 
from Margaret Morrison and three 
from Fine Arts. The members from 
Margaret Morrison are: Frances
Keiser, Elizabeth Lesser, Gertrude 
Overholt, Ruth Dawson, Katherine 
Eckert and Emily Fulton. Those 
from Fine Arts are Dorothy Boyle, 
Katherine Brown, and Elizabeth MeClung.
Miss Green is anxious that this year 
more Juniors attend the Prom. In 
years previous the price has been so 
high that many were not able to come. 
In order to avoid this two committees 
have been chosen to work on ways and 
means to collect the funds that will 
enable thecommittee to make the 
price lower.
These two committees will work in 
competition and probably there will be 
some award to the committee collect
ing the largest amount.
One committee will work in Arts 
School and the other will work in 
Margaret Morrison. The committee 
from Margaret Morrison comprises: 
Eunice Clark, Chairman; Ruth Han
ley, Ellenor Tallmadge, Gwendolyn 
(Continued on Page Two.)
BEEDE HEADS GAMBOL 
OF GUILDS COMMITTEE
Dwight V. Beede lias been selected 
as Chairman of the Gambol of the 
Guilds this year. The date pf the 
event is to be March 5. The re
mainder of tho committee will be ap
pointed by the chairman in the near 
future.
Beede was Captain of the Football 
Team this year, is a Building Con
struction Senior, a member of Druids, 
Delta Skull, and Dragons, and of 
Kappa Sigma Fraternity. He has 
won two Varsity Basketball letters, 
and held several class and school of
fices.
The Gambol of the Guilds is not to 
be confused with the Guild Carnival. 
The Carnival is arranged by the mem
bers of the Carnegie Tech Guild and 
always is scheduled just before Christ
mas. The Gambol of the Guilds how
ever is sponsored by the College of 
Industries and occurs in the spring.
The Gambol of the Guilds was origi
nally an exclusively Industries School 
affair. The couples were required to 
be attired in overalls and  bungalow 
aprons. In recent jrears the dance 
lias been opened to the four Colleges 
and the dancers may wear what they 
choose. Last year the Union was 
decorated with the machinery of the 
various trades taught in the College 
of Industries which made the event 
extremely picturesque.
TARTANS WIN 
FROM LEHIGH 
IN FINAL, 36-0
Beede, Bastian and DoncVoe 
Lead Plaid to Victory in 
Easy Game
VERSATILE ATTACK 
SWAMPS VISITORS
Kristoff, Manby and Cass Play 
Good Games on Line 
Positions
Carnegie closed its football season, 
Saturday at Forbes Field by giving 
the Lehigh team the worst trouncing 
it has received this season. Tiiis Is 
the first time the Tartans have beaten 
the Brown and White since they 
started playing several years ago. 
Because of Lehigh's great showing 
against the strong Lafayette team, the 
only team to beat Pitt this year, it 
was conceded that the Plaid warriors 
would have the fight of their lives to 
win but from tho first few minutes of 
play the outcome was never in doubt.
The scoring started in the first 
quarter when Beede fooled the oppo
nents with the famous spinner" play 
and ran .40 yards for a touchdown. 
This first touchdown seemed to take 
the pep out of Lehighs offense and 
defense for the Tartans gained al
most at will after that, while only an 
occasional pass or offtackle thrust 
netted Lehigh its three first downs of 
the game. The second marker came 
when Donalioe skirted the end for a 
touchdown. Another score came In 
the second quarter when Beede went 
over for the third marker of the game.
The little stunt that Bastian and 
Donahoe pulled off in the third quar
ter was the outstanding feature of the 
game. Bastian received the kick-off 
on the five-yard line and by a lot of 
flashy running and twisting, slipped 
through until he was downed on Le
highs  40-yard line. From this point 
Donahoe took It and skirted left enrt 
for the remaining 40 yards, it taking 
them only two plays to gain 05 yards. 
The second Skibo touchdown in this 
period came when Bastian dashed over 
after the ball had been Avorkod down 
to tho 15-yard line.
In the final period the Tartans had 
another chance to score and Beede 
took it through guard after Steffens 
well oiled machine had brought it to 
within striking distance of the goal.
Only once did Lehigh threaten to 
score, this coming In the second 
period. A double pass with OCallaghan carrying the ball put it on the 
30-yard line, where the Bethlehem 
grldders opened up an arial attack 
putting the ball on the 20-yard line. 
But here Manby, playing Ills same 
steady game, intercepted one of Le
highs passes and killed all hope they 
had of scoring.
Saturday saw the Tartans play the 
best brand of football that they have 
played this, season. With, the advan
tage of a dry field, the fast and smooth, 
running backfield could not be stopped. 
The battle although one-sided was not 
without its brilliant performers, 
Beede in working the spinner, Bas
tian in running back punts, Donahoes 
end runs, and Manbys defensive work, 
especially at breaking up passes. The 
lineup:

school orchestra will furnish the

DECEMBER A. I. EE. MEETING
NEXT WEDNESDAY NIGHT
Mr. Thomas Wurts, son of Profess
or Wurts will give an illustrated lec
ture on theElectrification of the 
Norfolk and Western Railroad at the 
December meeting of the American 
Institute of Electrical Engineers next 
Wednesday night in Room 11 Machin
ery Hall.
The meeting will be in the nature 
of a departmental reunion for while 
Mr. Wurts is not a graduate of Car
negie his father is the former head 
of Electrical Engineering Depart
ment. Refreshments will be served 
following the lecture.
Ray Winters, Senior Architect, was 
appointed Chairman of the Arts Ball 
by the Student Senate of tho Arts 
School, following the sudden resigna
tion of Russ Roller.
The resignation ;of Russ Roller as 
chairman of the Arts Ball came as a 
shock to the Student Body of tho 
Arts School at assembly last Tuesday. 
Roller gave press of school work as 
his reason foi^ withdrawing, and his 
resignation was reluctantly accepted, 
With the Ball Committee headless tho 
Senate immediately began the search 
for another man capable of handling 
the job, and decided upon Winters 
as the logical successor to Roller.
Winters, a Senior Architect, is a 
member of Pi Kappa Alpha and Tau 
Sigma Delta, and is a lieutenant In 
the R. O. T. C. He stands well in 
his class scholastically a ltd has al
ways been active in class affairs. His 
experience as a mfembcr of tho Con
struction committee for tho past two 
balls should enable him to handle 
competantly this years ball.
Winters is, following tho gonoral 
scheme for handling the ball as out
lined by his prodecossor. Tho plan, 
a departure from that or previous 
years, eliminates the position of sec
retary, and calls for two assistant 
chairmon instead of one. One assis
tant. chairman will have chargo of tho 
.entire social phase of the ball, formorly liandlod by the secretary and the 
social committee. Tho othor will 
have general chargo of tho doeorntions which were <*>eforo handled by 
individual committees of Design, Ex
ecution of Decorations, and Construc
tion. The new plan probably will 
prove more efficient in that it calls 
for a centralization of responsibility.
Winters first move as Chairman or 
tho ball was to appoint Stanley Stark 
assistant chairman In chdrgo of Doc*

Survey of Engineering Schools
Shows Decrease in Registration
Student enrollment in the technical 
schools of the country has steadily 
declined during the past five years 
according to registration statistics 
compiled by Registrar Alan Bright 
from figures supplied by leading tech
nical colleges and Institutes.
A comparison of the annual regis
tration figures of more than a score 
of colleges shows that tho abnormally 
large enrollments during the war peri
od were followed by a contraslugly 
sharp decrease in the number of stu
dents attending. This declining ten
dency has manifested itself in the 
succeeding registrations, including 
those of the past year. The enroll
ment for 1924-1925 has. however, been 
much more resistant to a falling off 
[than that of the preceding years, and 
! gives evidence of another reaction 
j and a gradual return to normal conj ditions. Registration figures for sev
eral of the leading technical schools
for the past two years are as follows:

tho Committee will prove.
Thoro will be aovoral surprises dur
ing the evening, among thorn being 
tho favors, which aro unique. Thoso 
favors will undoubtedly make suitable 
remembrances for this remarkable af
fair.
The price of admission to this years 
big Soph lloi) bus been reduced to tho 
small sum of $3.00 per couple. This 
foe is tho smallest that has boon 
charged for any big H6p or Prom lor

Sophomore can afford to miss this big 
dance, so bring your date to the niggest Carnegie Soph Hop, this Friday 
evening, between the hours of nine

done, he said, and "America stands 
todayand promises to stand for 
mnny a daythe most prosperous, the 
most pulBBant nation of tho world. 
We can affordand oughtto occupy 
ourselves increasingly with tilings ,of 
tho spirit; with art, science, culture. 
And there is evidence that this evolu
tion is in fact taking place.
Dr. Koinmer, saying that he spolre 
not as a foreigner, but as a student 
of the international stage, declared 
there was no difference between the 
American theater and the European 
theater, despite much contrary opin
ion. He said the chief difference he 
found was with the actors of various 
nations, the European actor having 
more of the ensemble spirit. The 
critics, lie said, were "just as stupid, 
malevolent and unsympathetic in Eu
rope as in America*' and "the audi
ence of America, for all the adverse 
criticism given them by American ac
tors and artists abroad, just as in
telligent." Proof of this, he said was 
to be iound (in the fact that the 
"Potash and Perlmutter was as 
much a success in all parts of the 
continent as in America. The young 
Intellectuals, he said, were at fault 
when they tried to give the plays of 
the misogynist Strindberg* in a land 
where women lire worshipped and 
exalted.**
The greatest difference between 
producing plays in Europe and in 
America, he said, was ecnomic. At 
the Rinehart Theater in Berlin, he 
said, 7 per cent of gross receipts went 
to pay theater rent, while In New 
York 45 per cent was handed over to 
the landlord. Since the Avar, but not 
as a result of the war, lie said, Ber
lin had lost to New York its claim to 
being the city for international plays.
Mr. Church, deploring the fact that 
the stage had offered plays of bad 
taste and insidious in suggestion, that 
thoro was an "iimndation of profanity 
since Eugene ONeil, hailed by Dr. 
Kommer and himself as a great 
genius, had set the example in tho 
"Hairy Ape and asserting that erotic 
plays might, liavo a sinister influence 
on the younger generation, declared 
that there must be no censorship ex
cept that of the public, which could 
kill any play with Its disapproval.
"Uncle S'ain is showing a growing 
tendency to meddle in tho affairs of 
his children," he aid, "and we must 
keep him oi\fc of tho theater.*
Prof. Baker, addressing the dele
gates on problems In teaching drama, 
declared that tho aim of tho Instruc
tor should be not to turn out studonts capable of producing technical
ly perfect plays so much as plays 
bearing tho stamp of originality, and 
Individuality; who should glvo to tho 
theater plays on subjots heretofore 
not artistically presented.
There is no use trying to force 
any aesthetic conception on the pub
lic, Slovens said. "It cant tie bono, 
oven gratis. Pittsburgh, as every one 
knows, will not support one really 
good serious play for a week.
The creation of an educated au
dience is perhaps the most important 
and pressing work before the artists 
of the theater todpy, Mr. Payne said.
John Galsworthys Justice" was 
given before the delegates by students 
of the Drama Department under the 
direction of Mr. Payne.
Thoroughness is the most needed 
quality in the personnel of the Little 
Thetater.  CHlarold A. Ehrensperger, 
chairman of the Lkle Theater Foun
dation, and formerly national execu
tive secretary of the Drama League of 
America, said Saturday in his address.
"I belive the Little Theater is the 
victim of dabblers. There they can 
dabble in acting, in art, in mechanics 
and in love. The only antidote is 
thoroughness, the speaker declared.
Little Theater and Community 
Playhouses* was the subject consid
ered by the conference Saturday. 
Pointing out that the community the
ater is a power in the development of 
a national theater art, Frederick Mc
Connell, a graduate of the department 
of drama, of Carnegie Tech/and now 
director of the Cleveland Playhouse, 
told the conference that a flourishing 
independent producing theater in 50 
cities of the country will in time pro
duce a finer nnd more genuine nation* 
al theater than will 50 theaters iii 
New York City, producing in tho 
beetle environment, of a slnglo street:."
Walter Pritchard Eaton, thontrioal 
critic, predicted that tho tlmo soon 
will come when no really good play 
will leavo Broadway for the "road," 
unless somothing is done to revivO an 
Interest in them that will support 
them outsido of New York.
Dr. S. Mtu'ion Tucker, former presi
dent of the Drama League of Amer
ica and director of the Play Work
shop of the Brooklyn Polytechnic In
stitute. urged the discarding of the 
Aerm Little Theater." This term 
connotes immaturity, weakness and 
makes a bid for concessions, declared 
Dr. Tucker. Why not some distinc
tive local name?
All Carnegie students living in the 
vicinity of Buffalo and Cleveland are

Christmas parties to be held by these

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA CLAN
In the beautiful and spacious home 
of Mr. and Mrs. Samuel Hall, 636 
South Plymouth boulevard, the mem
bers of the Southern California Car
negie Clan were very charmingly en
tertained on Saturday evening, No
vember 14. James Hall and his sis
ter, Miss Helen Hall, acting as host 
and hostess.
After the bridge and Mah Jong 
scores were computed, the prizes and 
delicious refreshments served, the 
President introduced a note of busi
ness into the festive atmosphere. He 
announced that the election of offi
cers for 1926 woUld take place at the 
next meeting of the clan to be held 
early in January, and appointed 
Messrs. Young, Mason, and Kindi to 
serve on the nominating Committee.
Several Carnegie men made their 
first appearance at the Clan parties on 
this occasion: W. J. Blackstock, C. W. 
Blodgett, E. T. Johnson, and C. P. 
Zimmers. Mr. Blodgett is a former 
member of the faculty of the college 
on Engineering and is located in Cali
fornia while working on the Colorado 
River Dam project.
NEW YORK CLAN
The New York Clan luncheons are 
getting bigger and better. They aro 
held in Sardis Restaurant, 30 Park 
Place, right behind tlie Woolworth. 
Building at 12:30 every'Tuesday, rain 
or shine. All Carnegie men are in
vited. This affords an excellent op-r 
portunity to meet former classmates 
and become acquainted With other 
Carnegie men.
China has eleven students at Car
negie, two of whom are sent here by 
the Chinese Government; funds for 
their education are gotten from the 
Boxer Indemnity Fund. China was 
compelled to pay heavily for the 
havoc wrought by the Boxer Rebel
lion. The United States was to rereive $1I2;455,507 for the damage done 
to United States Governmentproperty 
in China; however, the debt was can
celled aftfer it was proved that the 
'Chinese Government had no hand in 
the uprising. The cancelled debt was 
fundedthe interest from this .idemnity fund being used to send students 
to college.
One often "wonders why students 
come six thousand miles to Carnegie. 
All over the world Pittsburgh is 
known for its iron and steel and its 
engineering. Carnegie is fortunately

I
CARNEGIE STARS
LOST TO GRIDIRON
Several of Carnegies football team 
wore the plaid colors for the last time, 
in the Lehigh contest.
Max Bastian, playing his final game 
for the Plaid, was a great bulwark 
on offense. He ran the ends with 
deadly effect, his punts were good, 
and his long return of Lehigh kicks 
was nothing short of remarkable. 
Plaid followers regretted that Max 
had to be assisted from the field as a 
result of an injury in his last battle. 
The great ovation he received when 
life was brought to his bench expressed 
two thingsan expression of appre
ciation for the great game that he 
had played, and at the same time a 
regret that his flaying days were 
over.
Bennie Ivristof, veteran right end, 
also participated in his last game. 
Like Bastian, Bennie had to be re
moved on account of injuries, but he 
did enough to call it a perfect day. 
It was Bennie who received the 40- 
yard forward pass from the accurate 
arm of Donahoe which was respon
sible for one of the touchdowns.
There was still another Tartan who 
was playing his last gameCass, 
right guard. Plis strong physique 
withstood the Lehigh tackles and he 
remained until the last whistle. Cass 
played a great game. His big num
ber 90*' could frequently be seen lift
ing from a flattened Lehigh runner. 
The veteran Plaid linesman has 
served his school well. He stands in 
the line with a half smile playing 
over his face at all time. It is almost 
a challenge to an opponent to tackle 
him and yet it is a sign of the pleas
ant disposition that is a part of Cass. 
Carnegie will miss him.
Tribute is also due Wertenberger, 
the defensive halfback. Wert never 
carries the ball, but he is always "in 
there doing his share. He is one of 
those silent, fighting fellows, who 
never receive^ all the credit due him.
ADVERTISE AND GET RESULTS
SWIMMING TEAM
MAKING PROGRESS
The latest news from the pool shows 
that the swimming team is fast round
ing into shape for its first dual meet 
with Thiel, the date yet to be set. 
Plans are also being made for meets 
with four or five other teams in this 
district.
The squad received quite a set back 
when it lost Bob Follansbee, because 
of his scholastic standing. Bob was 
quite the star in the intermural swim 
last spring, being high point man for 
the meet. He took first in the 25, 50, 
and 100-yard dashes. Bob also swims 
for the P. A. A., being a member of 
the relay team that recently broke the 
200-yard A. M. A. A. record. Nimick 
is showing up well in the dashes so 
he will probably be called on to take 
Follansbees place.
There is still plenty of chance to 
make the team, and Coach Buechema 
urges that all those wishing to try out 
should report at the pool on Monday 
and Friday from 4:15 to 6:00, and on 
Wednesday from 5:00 to 6:00. Lets 
go now and give this new sport as 
much support as we do the rest.

four undergraduate groups, the alum
ni and'the profs, all vieing for the 
coveted silver cup. It is possible that 
the charge of professionalism which 
has been entered against the two new 
cylinders by the trusworthy four will 
be accepted and that as a result the 
faculty and alumni will be excluded 
from the cup contest but all this de
pends on the magnanimity of the 
present students.
It has been decided that generosity 
has some bounds, however, and that 
in this case they are the Engineering 
School with only one exception. Due 
to the fact that the freshmen of 
Science and Industries are combined 
they will all be permitted to come, 
but excepting this favored group only 
Science men can attend.
On the Plaid Screen
J. A. C. FOLLERj,
THE LEHIGH GAME
Saturday marked the close of another football season. Ono which was 
as successful as any Carnegie has ever onjoyed, and yet ono which has 
seen each of the three leading contests terminate unsatisfactorily. These 
three, Notre Daine, Pitt and W. & J., will appear on next years schedule, 
however, and from present indications it is not likely that the several out
comes will be paralleled.
The futility of attempting to rate the respective strengths of two foot
ball teams was demonstrated with remarkable clarity in the Lehigh game 
of the past week end. After holding Lafayette to two meagre touchdowns, 
it is hard to see how Lehigh could go to pieces so completely on the follow
ing Saturday. It is true, however, that the Tartans were at the peak of form, 
and perhaps the combination of the two conditions accounted for the over
whelming victory.
At no time this season has the Tartan eleven displayed itself to better 
advantage. Nearly everything that was attempted in passing, running, and 
punting proved successful.
NEXT SEASONS SCHEDULE
In addition to Pitt, Notre Dame and W. & J., New York University has 
been booked. The game will take place in New York on November 6. Nego
tiations are progressing with West Virginia, and it is possible that Carnegie 
will make the trip to Morgantown next year. That neither Mt. St. Marys, 
Drexel nor St. Louis will be met is practically certain, as an effort is being 
made to schedule more of the'colleges in the tri-state district, and at the 
same time to have the games dove-tail with the 1926 program of the Univer
sity of Pittsburgh.
THE GAME WITH W. & J.
That the post season contest with W. & J. which was proposed several 
weeks ago, will not take place, is no surprise to those in touch with the 
schools athletics. The match would have settled nothing, and would have 
prolonged the season unnecessarily. In all probability the Plaid now has 
the best decision that is obtainable this season, the 0-0 tie. The time to play 
a football game is on the date that it is scheduled for, happen what may. 
At. no other time is it ethically in its place.

our opinion, several names should be shifted from the second team lineup 
to that of the first. A comment on this list from some of the old grads who 
have kept in touch with Plaid athletics would be welcomed.

SURVEY OF ENGINEERING
SCHOOLS SHOWS DECREASE
(Continued From Pase One.)
The average decrease shown bore 
s comparatively small and, in some 
sections, substantial gains were mado.
The vast increases of ton years ago 
were directly duo to the unusual domands of the war poriod. Nevor woro 
engineers more important or more In 
demand than during the time from 
1915 to 1920. The decroases of the 
succeeding years were but a natural 
reaction to the temporary stimulus of 
the World War and woro groatly ac
celerated by the general economic de
pression of the times as woll as by 
the lessened demand for teohnlcal 
men. The registration flguros glvon 
above indlcato a gradual checking or 
tills decrease and give promise of 
normal progress in the future,
Anothor peculiar aspect of rocent 
enrollment figures is the incroased 
percent of upperclassmen as compar
ed to the freshmen classes. Every 
year an increasingly largo number or 
students are entering tochnical 
schools with advanced standing from 
colleges. The freshmen, on the othor. 
hand have suffered the sovorost de
creases and have shown a compara
tively higher mortality rate. At the 
same time, the number of students 
pursuing graduato work, which Tell 
off enormously in the war period, has 
been increasing rapidly each year.
The figures used in these considera
tions were carefully averaged for a 
large number of colleges in all parts 
of the country, and, while they may 
not be taken as absolute totals, yet 
they do show aotual trends.
Every day we hear complaints 
about this course and that but at 
HARVARD they do the thing sys
tematically. The Harvard "Crimson" 
recently contained the opinions of 
students regarding *10 of the courses 
given at the college. Of course, the 
knocks were in the majority, many 
"parrot courses being mentioned, 
that is, courses which can be passed 
by memorizing a lot of rules.

give the name and address of the 
woman.
The Alaska Agricultural College 
and School of Mines located at Fair
banks, Alaska is the farthest north 
college, being 100 miles distant from 
the Arctic Circle. Last year there 
were 69 students registered. This 
year the enrollment has Increased to 
150 students.
With a crown of red hair as the 
only prerequisite for membership and 
the only means of identification, the 
Blazers have made their advent up
on the Iowa Wesleyan campus. Only 
one professor qualified with the ne
cessary carrot-colored tresses.
The University of California has 
instituted a course in "dumbell Eng
lish. All entering students are re
quired to take an examination in Eng
lish and upon failure must take a 
special course in elementary composi

PAGE FOURTHE CARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY, DECEMBER 1, 1925
dPEDITORIAL PAGE
dP
IS EDUCATION AN ADVENTURE?How Fickle Women Ai
Occasionally, the Tartan publishes information 
which brings forth commcnt, usually caustic 
comment to the effect that a little copy reading 
would not prove unbene/icial. A rare article, 
however, may cause its readers to think. Such 
an article was Mr. Porters reply to his own 
query Itow high shall we build Carnegie?" 
And the consequent comment is this very inter
esting letter:
Dear Mr. Editor:
Perhaps a former editor oJ! The Tartan may 
impose upon your linotypial. hospitality to record 
his interest in things pertaining to the present 
and the future Carnegie. Our heartiest congrat
ulations go to .you and, your staff! for the excellent 
paper you are getting out. It is most refreshing 
to see that so many crudities have been ironed 
out during the fifteen years which have elapsed 
since we used to hope enougli copy would appear 
from nowhere to fill the sheet.
At that time we seemed to be struggling for a 
policy which lay somewhere between two courses 
of action, each of which was plain and explicit, 
but which were not coincident. It was like wan
dering in the confusion of no-mans land between 
entrenched and conflicting views. The old titular 
phrase Tech Schools gave a temporary black eye 
to the larger aspects of our existence. It smacked 
of the primary school system. No one knew 
whether we were a trade school with a few fancy 
additions tacked on chiefly for advertising pur
poses or whether engineering and arts were to 
occupy the big tent and let the rest scramble for 
position in the Side show as best they could. But 
that conflict is ancient history. We know what 
manner ol! craft we are by this time. That is a 
lot more than anyone in my time ever hoped to 
know.
It now makes me think of an ocean liner, 
launched, christened, outfitted, chartered, 
manned and cargocd, headed out to sea. An en
tity, a definite unit of a certain number of decks 
and compartments, all located within one hull, 
powered by one power plant, and steered from 
one wheel house. We cannot allow various des
tinations for tho various decks; nor can we pro
vide a separate safety for her component parts. 
A smash is necessarily a common catastrqphy, an 
aggregate peril. We steer from one chart, not 
four; tho engineer answers one signal, not sev
eral.
We former passengers have been invited to 
take stock in the company under the most liberal 
and tempting.terms as announced by Mr. Porter. 
How High Shall We Build Carnegie? ho asks us 
in his very admirable letter. The ship owners 
would have more fuel for the boilers so they can 
raise the steam pressure and drive the steamer 
faster and farther over the shimmering and re
lentless seas. It is an attractive slogan, an ar
resting question. Wo subscribe to its purpose 
and endorse its pertioncy; commend its elnrity 
and laud its brevity. But thcro is ono question 
wo would like to ask those ship owners.
What ol tho captain and his orders? What 
chart has he before him? What are his ports ol! 
cull? What; articles ol! commerce docs he carry 
and what does he seek? Is ho carrying precious 
stud's in the hold or is tho ship weighed down 
with canvas sucks filled with sand? Wo havo a 
craft, boautiful, trim, an inspiring and truly 
thrilling sight glistening under fair skios and ca
ressed by favorable winds, but what is her destin
ation? Whore aro wo going? What is tho poliey 
of Carnogio Institute ol! Technology?
 Wo havo boon mado familiar with tho noods 
of tho boiler room, may we not hoar from the 
b,idHW?
 Yours for Carnogio,
hOWKUi W. hOhhWhKUi.
Mr. Nichols questions so naturally oonelude 
his theme that wo wonder why they have never 
before boon given tho dignity of a written pre
sentation. The subject involved has evoked ox 
pression from every student at one time or an
other, yet has always boon too transcendental to 
inspire more than a few breezy hypothesos. Lot 
us proffer an analysis.
Since Mr. Nichols has developed his allegory so 
capably, we will extend his parallel and name our 
destination. We are bound for the land beyond 
the North Wind. We sail over the erratic waters 
of pedagogy which, though traversed before, are 
still uncharted. Like the voyagers of Ulysses we 
depend more upon a fickle wind than upon a 
watering compass to guide us rightly.
As for our cargo; be it of coarse sand or golden 
apples, let us ask rather whether it is marketable. 
This is a commercial era and we are merchants 
who must sell our wares. We sail 011, and one 
who views Carnegies progress cries: Behold, 
our Jason is bringing us to the Golden Fleece. 
Another, lacking this Argonauts optimism, ex
claims: Fool, that is but the setting sun shim
mering across the waters!
And both are right.
A CHALLENGE TO HYPOCRISY
WARSD NLWP
RIPPLES
About a year ago President Baker appointed a 
Faculty Committee for Student Welfare witli 
Professor A. J. Wurts as chairman. This com
mittee has been quietly (as proof of its sincerity) 
working out its own extensive program of im
provements, vory effectively accomplishing its 
ends. Now, according to a letter from Professor 
Wurts, the organization is ready to undertake the 
solution of problems brought forward by students 
and faculty, and the fulfillment of thoughtful, 
constructive suggestions relating in some way to 
.the woll-being of Carnegie.
It seems quite clear that ono prerequisite to 
usefulness along this line is oo-oporation. Tho 
very name, Student Welfare, suggests this much.
* * * In every community there are always many 
social and moral, forces; some are weak, some are 
strong, but all are pulling, exerting an iufluenco, 
in as many different directions. Questionwhat 
is the resultant force? Is il up or is it down?
* * * Wo can and must make the resultant force 
strong, powerful, and in tho right direction.
Now, the purpose of this letter is to invite stu
dents, groups of students, and the faculty to co
operate with the Welfare Committee towards this 
end. * * # Suggestions may be made by letter or 
personal interview with the chairman (Professor 
Wurts, 147 Industries) and we would welcome to 
our meetings any member of the faculty or stu
dent body bearing a message for our considera
tion.
That is certainly a straightforward issue, and 
should gain the hearty attention of Carnegies 
entire personnel. Admittedly, collegians tend 01*
THE GRACE OF RETICENCE
I Ion/; Cor tho (lay when our more civilized friends 
from across tho Atlantic can visit America without 
fooling obligated to write in their memoirs the usual 
gloomy appraisals of our ideals and our conduct. We 
realize our gross materialism and a certain artificiality 
in our conduct; it is the business of our own profes
sional critics of life and letters to warn us of our overonthusittsmB, our tendency toward doting on every
thing from wives to Lions Clubs, and our complete ab
sorption in enterprise and prosperity. But when our 
Avenknessos are pointed out to us by every Slmw, Wells, 
or Asquith, after a perfunctory sojourn of two or three 
woolts, wo becomo rightly indignant.
One critic, summing up tho American mind after 
spending ten days in Now York, writes: "To be poor
in order to bo simple, to produce less in order that the 
product may ho choice and boautiful, and may leave us 
loss burdened with unnecessary duties and useless pos
sessionsthat is an ideal' not yot articulate In tho 
American mind. Others soo in Amorica a tactic op-, 
timlstio assumption about existence that tho more ex
istence tho bettor.".
On tho surface tho ovldoneo against us poems' most 
damning. But thoro Is a spark of light visible now and 
tlion that is nevor mentioned in tho findings of tho 
casual observer. At tlmos tho working mind of the 
American has its holiday, On those occasions ho loves 
knowledge, lie revels In beautiful landscape, in music 
at least lie linds an art that ho wholo-hoartodly enjoys, 
and lio lovos mankind. Bosides, his conversations aro 
spliced pro tty thickly with humor, and humor is ono 
form Of moral emancipation, Those tilings mark tho 
beginning of an idealism that will 1 (borate Amorica 
from the ominous label of materialism. In tho mean
while our distinguished visitors will continuo to judge 
us by what they observe 011 tholr hurried business trips, 
AH of which reminds me of a story.
A. few old-timers who are lol't In the world, doddering 
along at seventy or eighty, can romembor that in Eu
rope, years ago, (here was such a tiling as the Crimean 
War, In which tho French and English undertook to 
bottle up Russia and so laid siege to Sebastopol. This 
was tho war In which, you remember, some 000 Brit
ish cavalry charged 10,000 Russians who had artillery 
to defend them and which was mado immortal by 
Tennyson in his Charge of the Light Brigade. It also 
caused General Cunrobort to adjust an eyeglass as he 
viewed tho scone and exclaim: "Cest bleu beau mals
nost co pas la guerre"Its lovely, but It. Is not war.
Now, at that time thoro was a big hospital 011 tho 
Bosphorus where they had thousands of sick and 
wounded. As tho hospital was overcrowded and al
ways receiving recruits, tho doctors in charge used to 
go through the wards ovory morning and, whenever 
they found a man deud, they marked a cross at the 
head of the bed. Then attendants would come along, 
sow up the corpse in a bag, attach some heavy shot to 
it and throw it out the window into the Bosphorus 
and thus make room for another wounded soldier. It 
was an expeditious and highly economical manner of 
disposing of a corpse.
One morning the attendants came to a bed over 
which there was a cross. They began to sew the party 
up. The party, however, rose up and cried: What
the devil are you people doing 
You are dead," said the attendants.
The hell I am!" said the party.
The doctors know that better than you, said they, 
and they sewed him up and threw him out.
I commend this story to our foreign critics who in
sist that America is hopelessly dead in materialism, 
and quite likely to remain so.M. T. H.
pretend to be skeptical of the value and power 
of such committees, and to grow continually more 
skeptical as they approach their pinnacles of con
structive thought. If they will but consider the 
schools active administration, they will at least 
question their doubts.
The Student Welfare Committee could, we 
think, best accomplish its scheme of expansion by 
first gaining the confidence of the student body 
through direct co-operation with established stu
dent organizations. Tho Inter-fraternity Council, 
for instance, is at present involved in a vital dis
cussion of rushing rules. The compilation and 
analysis of scholastic rating statistics is tho crux 
to tho solution of the enigma. If Professor 
Wurts and his colleagues will aid in this work, 
rendering unbiased decisions from the faculty 
point of view, they will undoubtedly be aiding 
. Carnegie, and at the same time establishing con
tact with the students.
The Cosmopolitan Club, representing the for
eign scholars; the Campus publications, especially 
the Technical Journal; the Athletic Association 
all these organizations have problems worthy of 
the attention of a committee composed entirely 
of faculty members. The committee will have to 
make the first direct advances, however.
The students are incessantly complaining of 
the administrations seeming indifference to 
personal rights and student opinion. At last 
these complainants are to be challenged. The 
hypocrites will refuse the proffered opportunities 
for discussion and correction.
[ ARTS THEATER ]
RIDERS OF THE SEA
AND FOLLOWERS
It would not be fair to give at this 
time more than a general discussion 
of the recent two matinees of Rid
ers to the Sea and Followers.'* In 
the first place, the plays could not 
possibly have attained' a sufficient 
height of perfection in only a couple 
of performances. And in tho second 
place, they are to be combined with 
two other one-acts later in the season 
for a week's run, so that they can be 
criticized at length then. As they 
stand, liowover, they present an in
teresting contrast; an atmospheric 
Irish tragedy and a moro or less at
mospheric English comedy.
Syngos Riders to tho Sea is less 
a play than a siistainod dirgethe 
keening off old Maurya over the 
drowning of tho men of her flslier 
family. Tho characters apparently 
speak only commonplace, and about 
coiumonplnuo tilings; but ovory word 
they say carries tho play forward, 
everything they montion symbolizes 
Lhoir lato. Tho cake intondod for 
Bartley that the maker of tho coffin 
gets; tho white boards for Michael's 
coffin, that Is lllmtlly made for Bart
loy; tho knife bought in Connemara 
and used on the cord around Mich* 
tol's clothes; the rope for the ponys 
halter, that should have boen used to 
drag Bartloy out. of tho water; all 
those simple things point to tho fate 
ordained by the sea. At tho end Maur
ya completes tho gloomy note by tak
ing dismal comfort by the thought 
that the sea can do nothing more to 
her.
Katherine Mansfield as; Maurya at 
times was very good, but, unfortunate
ly, more often was not. Her voice is 
too young for the part and lacks con
trol. Elizabeth Mclfaddeu and Irena 
Kosinskf, the daughters showed con
siderable feeling for their parts; and 
Edward Downes was sufficient as 
Bartloy. Mr. McEnteos direction, es
pecially of the grouping at the end, 
was carefully and rytnmically plan
ned. The effect of dusk falling on 
the set in background was especially 
pleasing.
Followers," by Harold Brighouse, 
is a comedy on the Old sweethearts' 
theme, and in the typical Brighouse 
manner. The rather improbable situ
ation oE former lovers remaining 
faithful for twenty years is made to 
seem quite possible. An ironic touch 
is given by both" realizing in the end 
that there is no future lor their 
dreams, and by the relenting of Miss 
Baines in her edict no followers 
for her maid. The spirit of the spin
ster's establishment is well projected, 
and the dialogues are at once natural 
and clover.
Two 'casts of Freshmen students 
alternated in this play, so consequent
ly two entirely different, perform
ances were given. Ruth Parrott was 
tho rogrottul but determined Lucinda 
Baines; Eleanor Mitchie, cnlni and 
resigned. Raymond Jones played 
Colonel Rod t orn w ith strengt h and 
authority; Victor lOskor, excitably. 
As Susan, the maid. Marjorie Barth
olomew and Annabello Glenn wero 
nearly identical: and Helen Woil and 
Imma Weinberg both made lovely 
Helen Masters. So much for odious 
comparisons. Suffice it to say that 
both casts acquitted themselves well 
considering that it was their first 
play at Cnrnepie.
ADVERTISE AND GET RESULTS
John E. Lewis holds again the cen
ter on national news interest with the 
letter sent to the President of the 
United States, practically demanding 
that the Government step in and back 
up the United Mine Workers in their 
effort to maintain the Jacksonville 
agreement. The penalty that was 
threatened, if tho President did not 
lend his co operation, was that of a 
strike in the soft coal industry. The 
contents of Mr. Coolidges letter will 
be waited upon with much interest. 
Regardless of what may be our pre
conception about competition in indus
try, ono. has to admit, that in com
modities that are essential, there has 
got to come some kind of govern
mental control. Like the I. C. C. in 
the rail industry there must be the 
same in the Coal industry and when it 
does come the Unions can feel that 
they have brought it on themselves.
The Fergusons of Texas are again in 
the public eye. Movement is under 
way to impeach the Governor, other
wise known as Ma Ferguson. The 
charges that will be brought against 
her will be those of incompetence and 
waste of state funds. A petition was 
presented to her with the ultimatum 
that she call a special session of Leg
islature not later than December 10th 
for the obvious purpose of calling to 
account all tax state officials. This 
action is not to be wondered at,Jf we 
remember the incidents that brought 
Mrs. Ferguson to the present position. 
In the final elimination she was the 
only remaining candidate on the antiK. K. K. party and this was the reason 
for her election and not her own 
particular qualifications. It was the 
case of two evils, Mrs. Ferguson or 
the K. K. K. and the people of Texas 
took the lessor. Now trouble has 
started again, which has been .aggra
vated by the feeling that the ex-Governor, her husband is the power be
hind the chair and he has many ene
mies.
The government of M. Caillaux fell 
a week ago and the President of the 
country has ever since been trying 
to get one of the leaders to form a 
new Cabinet which was finally cul
minated while M. Briand announcing 
that he had accomplished the task. 
The President originally asked M. 
Briand but he failed to get a majority 
and then he called 011 Senator Paul 
Doumergue, who in turn failed and 
M. Herriot was called in who failed 
and finally Briand got a government. 
The difficulties are two fold, the. first, 
the very difficult problems that are 
facing the French Government and 
the second task of finding among the 
various political alignments in the 
Chamber and the Senate a majority 
opinion. Under the Premiership of 
M. Painleve there were the following 
so-called political parties: Radicals 
and Radical Socialists, Socialist Re
publicans and French Socialists, the 
Radical Left and the Republican 
Democratic Left, the Republican 
Democratic Union, Republicans on the 
Left, Democrats, Communists and a 
few Independents.
To got into tho beliefs of these 
various parties is not our task but it 
is plain to see tho difficulties of try
ing to get a majority opinion in this 
polyglot grouping and it is of grave 
concern to France to provent herself 
from being sacrificed 011 the altar of 
political parties, at a time when she 
needs all her strength to solve her 
world problems.
On tho second reading, the German 
Reichstag approved tho Security Pact 
and the Arbitration Treaties that were 
drawn up at Locarno by a vote of 271 
to 159. The Pact goes into effect 
when the League meets in early De
cember and at that time Germany 
takes her seat with full power for the 
first time. Whether the past is a 
success or not, we can only feel that 
all attempts at co-operation must avail 
the world something.

ORGAN RECITAL
Four numbers from Mendelssohns 
"Midsummer Nights Dream music 
are on Dr. Heinroths Free Organ Re
cital program for Saturday night, De
cember 5th, at 8:15. They are the 
Overture, Nocturne, Scherzo, and 
Wedding March. This incidental 
music of Mendelssohn is regarded as 
a model, the finest of its kind, being 
at all times in perfect accord with the 
play. Mendelssohn was a boy of 17 
when he composed the Overture. 
Nowhere in the domain of art has 
there been such an instance of pre
cocity. Seventeen years later he
wrote the twelve other numbers.
Tchaikovskys Canzonetta from 
Violin Concerto is also on the pro
gram. This Concerto was the com
posers only great work to receive its 
first performance outside Russia. The 
Canzonetta is in a mellow, melan
choly mood.

W. All of these delegates showed an 
intelligent interest in the questions 
discussed, and. a desire to carry back 
to tholr respective campuss the ideas 
gleaned at the conference.
In order that interest in the World 
Court may be further aroused, the 
delegates to the recent conference, 
will on returning to their respective 
campuss, form a Committee on the 
Woi'ld Court, of which they them
selves will be the nucleus. These com
mittees will stimulate Interest in and 
arouse discussion about the World 
Court. And Sometime in the near 
future, a vote will be taken oh each 
campus, to ascertain what the student
opinion really is on the World Court.
On December 11 and 12, another 
conference on the World Court will 
be held, at Princeton, and to this con
ference have been invited delegates 
from colleges all over the United 
States.
Boston College may never have a 
seismograph according to latest re
ports. Fr. McHugh, S. J., who spent 
two years under Fr. Tondorf at George
town says that if the edge on which
B. C. is built extends under Common
wealth avenue the shock which an or
dinary motor would cause would dis
turb the delicate instrument.
STUDENTS TO VOTE ON 
WORLD COURT SCHEME
The World Court Conferences, held 
on the Campus two weeks ago, dem
onstrated that college students really 
do think about national problems, and 
that they are interested enough to 
gather together and "discuss these 
problems, if they are given the oppor
tune to do so. At the recent con
ference about sixty delegates were 
present, including the official dele
gates from Pitt. Cnvnejrie. and P. C.
