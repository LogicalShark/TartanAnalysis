BASE BALL TALK
VOL. II, No. 26 art an
PITTSBURG, PA., WEDNESDAY, MARCH 25, 1908TEN CENTS
On account of the inclement weather the base
ball candidates have not had much chance to show 
their ability during the past week. Early in the 
week about thirty candidates showed up for practice 
and on Tuesday a game was played between two 
picked teams which gave all concerned some good 
fast practice. Some good players have been found 
as a result.
The schdule which we print is subject to change 
but will probably remain in this form:
April 4West Virginia University (away).
11Penna State College (away).
18Probably Westminster (away).
 25Grove City (away).
 29Wup (away).
May 2Washington & Jefferson (at home).
9Wup or Allegheny College (at home).
 16Penna State (at home).
 23Wup or Allegheny College (at home).
 302 games with W. & J. at Washington, Pa.
June 6Case School of Cleveland (at home).
 13Pittsburg Collegians (at home).
16Wup (Commencement game at home).
 18Waynesburg College (away).
(Commencement game for them).
20Slippery Rock (away).
Efforts are being made to bring Westminster, 
Grove City, Oberlin, West Virginia Wesleyan, and 
others here for Wednesday's games.
Assistant Manager Chancellor is getting a hard 
schedule together for the Reserves, and we will prob
ably be able to watch them at work when the first 
team is away.
On account of the strong home schedule it is 
hoped that the students will turn out to the games 
and support the team with a will for, as has been 
said before, the team is practically helpless, unless
the players know that the students are back of them. 
So add up your dollars and save up your rocks and 
help Tech to win the position, which she ought to 
hold, namely, at the top.

Miss Frances Looney, 09...............Business Manager
Last Thursday we heard three very interesting 
talks upon the movement to improve the general 
milk supply. They were given by Dr. Eaton, Dr. 
Litchfield and Dr. Cameron.
Dr. Eaton dealt with the hygiene of milk; the 
necessity for milk being raised under most careful, 
clean, and hygienic conditions, to make the chances 
as small as possible of disease germs being carried 
in the milk. The most important preventatives he 
gave were: Clean stables, healthy cows, and good 
sanitary conditions in the milking.
The adulteration of milk was spoken of by Dr. 
Litchfield. Pasteurization of milk is not looked upon 
with much favor now-a-days, as it destroys the lactic 
acid bacillus; this bacillus, is really a protection to 
milk, for it destroys other germs more harmful to the 
human. When the lactic bacillus is destroyed milk 
does not turn sour so quickly, but these harmful 
germs grow, and putrefaction is apt to set in before 
there is any bad taste noticeable.
It has been proved that bovine tuberculosis is 
transmittable to humans. Any diseased cow should 
not be milked for the purpose of selling her milk.
Dr. Cameron stated that the Medical Milk Com
mission is trying to regulate the sale of milk so that 
people will get fresh, clean, raw milk, as that is the 
most useful, nourishing, and easily assimilated form 
of milk. It is their desire that the county, State, or 
city control the sale of milk, and they are carrying 
on a campaign of education to rouse every citizen to 
see the necessity of such a regulation.
New Study Hall regulations
1. Hereafter thoughtfulness for others will be 
the rule in Study Hall.
2. Silence must be maintained if the girls have 
to be muzzled.
4. Text books may be had by applying to the 
teacher in charge of the hall, by giving a signed 
guarantee that they will be returned.
Glee Club.
The M. M. C. S. Glee Club thinks it will often 
have its picture taken. Never was there such a large 
attendance as last Friday, when the photographer 
arrived.
Members of the Club, we hereby let you know 
that we need your aid, and hope to see you present 
at every meeting in the future. The faithful few 
are doing excellent work and deserve much praise.

for all others. Let it be known that the 1910 girls 
were in earnest enough to start and maintain that 
which will always be an honor for their class. Meet
ings are held every Monday afternoon at 3.15 in the

Many of us are glad to have Robin Redbreast 
revisit the city. He comes at a very opportune time 
to encourage us with his merry call, which, when 
interpreted seems to say: Cheer up, cheer up; be 
cheery. In one way, it is very hard to sit in class 
and listen to the merry fellow singing his little 
songs and trying his hardest to fcheer us, for we 
want to be with him. In another, he helps to bright
en the sometimes dismal hours and make the time 
seem shorter. He is always a sure indication of 
glorious spring and we are always glad to welcome 
both of them.

A movement is on foot at Vanderbilt University 
to substitute for examinations what is known as the 
Exemption Grade System. This system requires the 
student to make as much as 80 to 85 per cent, on 
his daily and monthly grades. We find this system 
is practiced in the four large universities of Leland 
Stanford, Jr., Columbia, Cornell and Purdue. May 
the day speedily come when other universities will 
fall in line.

NIGHTNINETEEN TEN
J. H. Taxis, Editor.
The article in last weeks issue, Night Men 
Celebrate, sounds like the writings of the mooneditor of 1911. His comparisons of 1910 were rather 
far fetched, and were written to draw attention 
from his verdant class. A more awkward crowd of 
boys was seldom seen on a dance floor, and their 
methods to have classes dismissed in the M. M. C. S. 
were, to say the least, embarrassing, not only to the 
instructors, but to .the girls themselves. A poor at
tempt to imitate the movements of the day students. 
The remark of the leader of 1911 that, I am respon
sible for this, was superfluous, for no one would 
think of attributing such actions to any but 1910.
As for the noise that was heard, a mistake was 
made as to its source, not the crackling of bones 
of some prehistoric specimens, but the squeaking 
of mice at play, when the cats away. As some of 
the girls remarked, one dont feel at ease with the 
second year men, knowing the proverbial dislike 
of the feminine sex for mice. Further comparisons 
are unnecessary.

Sections C and D had only one session on Tues
day night, affording the boys an opportunity of get
ting 'home early. All but Dibble took advantage 
of the occasion. He had to hike to the Natatorium 
for a swim.* ' * * *
After school habits of the boys of 1910 are va
rious and amusing. Some go home immediately, 
others seek places where good things to eat can be 
had; one or two go swimming, several gather round 
the piano in Machinery Hall and dispense music, 
and some gather in other class rooms to talk over the 
lessons assigned. Then there is the crowd that 
walk west on Forbes street when they should take 
cars going east. It is always the same thing each 
school night. Their consistency is remarkable and 
commendable.

HENRY HORNBOSTEL, %Ph.B.
Tech claims an apostle in Professor Hornbostel, 
for he does not advance, prove and refuse to abide 
by his own doctrines as earnestly as any prophet 
ancient or modern? Professor Hornbostel is the 
apostle of Bluff. He has proved to his own and 
the student bodys satisfaction that a good bluff 
is worth more than vast knowledge without the 
bluff. He proves the aforementioned proposition by 
citing how unnecessary he found it to understand* 
the meaning of stress and strain while designing 
Hell Gate bridge, never failing to make proof more 
conclusive by betraying an intimate knowledge of 
every member and its duty to the whole. Since 
his connection with the Tech Faculty, which has 
been since its inception, he has conducted some ori
ginal investigations as to the History of Architecture, 
most important of which has been his discoveries 
as to the Thirst of the Romans, made public for the 
first time in 1906.
Professor Hornbostel discovered that life was 
a funny proposition at a date considerably earlier 
than did Little Johnny Jones. The fact that his 
publicity promoters were not on the job as were 
the latter's, robbing him of the credit due him. He 
has succeeded in making his general lectures to 
three successive Plebe classes so interesting that
he has been able to have a quorum without the form
ality of a roll-call. Although there has at some times 
been slight dissatisfaction with his apparent care
lessness in making those that were verbatim dupli
cates with widely varying grades, the general con
sensus of opinion has been that Professor Hornbostel 
was to be given the benefit of the doubt.
In conclusion, we might say that all the students 
who have come in contact with him respect his 
proved ability and admire the thorough yet enter
taining way he handles his subject, and there is no 
tendency on the part of other schools to scoff at the 
affection in which the School of Applied Design 
holds him. The other schools only wish that they 
were enabled to see more of him.

THISTLE IMBROGLIO REACHES ITS CULMINA
TION.
After several weeks of controversy the Thistle 
situation has been settled; at least for the present 
year, So much feeling has been aroused by the 
action of Applied Science in refusing to co-operate 
in an all-schools publication, that Dr. Hamerschlag 
deemed it advisable to ask that school to reconsider 
and if possible rescind their action in order to make 
for the best interest in institutional spirit. Heated 
discussions took place in meetings held by the two 
upper classes of the Day School on Monday, and 
after lengthy sessions both classes declared them
selves in favor of an all-schools publication, the 
Senior class making the reservation that this action 
wias to apply for this year only.

Syracuse University has what is called the la

influence and name of the University.

REVIEW OF THE HOCKEY SEASON.
With the closing of the ice skating season on 
Saturday evening the third hockey season of Carne
gie Tech will be brought to a close. From the stand
point of the number of games played the season can 
not be called a successful one, but much has been 
done towards a good season next year, of which the 
students, as a body, are unaware. With the opening 
of two new artificial skating rinks, one at Columbus 
and one at Cleveland, new prospects for trips appear. 
Considerable correspondence was held with the man
ager of the Elysium Rink at Cleveland regarding a 
date for Tech this year, but the project fell through, 
due to lack of interest in the game by Cleveland 
people. Letters were also sent to two rinks in To
ronto in an effort to close up a game with Toronto 
University, but replies were not received. Toronto 
University was willing to come here, but it was 
thought that as they had been here twice before, 
we should be given'a chance to make the trip. Pros
pects for a trip to Troy to engage in a game with 
Rensselaer Tech are bright and a date with West 
Point might be arranged at the same time. The' 
cadets were quite willing to play us this year, but 
are not allowed to leave the Academy, and their al
lowance for hockey was not large enough to warrant 
the expense of bringing Carnegie Tech so great a 
distance.
The existence of the professional league in this 
city is a hindrance to amateur hockey, but it is hoped 
that we get a few games next year at home.

LETTER FROM MR. H. A. GARDNER,
Stating Objects and Methods cf Paint Investigation.
The Paint Manufacturers of the United States 
have instituted a Scientific Section with every
thing at its disposal to carry on investigations into 
the Paint Question.
The gases and smoke of Pittsburgh present a 
problem that we wish to solve in a practical way, 
and to that end the Scientific Section has placed 
one of its test fences at the Carnegie Technical 
Schools upon a bluff opposite the Margaret Morrison 
Carnegie Building.
This fence is seven feet high and nearly two 
hundred feet long and runs East and West, present
ing a southern and northern exposure. Upon  this 
fence have been placed over 500 panels painted with 
nearly 60 different combinations of pigments in 
varying percentages and in different tints. These 
panels are placed on both sides of the fence and are 
made of three different kinds of wood, namely Cy
press, White Pine and Yellow Pine, it being the in
tention to try out each formula on the three different 
kinds of wood, and on each exposure.
This work has been under the direction of Dr. 
James and his Inspector and official weigher, to
gether with the Inspector from the Paint Manufac
turers Association, and the Inspector from the 
Pittsburgh Branch of the Master Painters Associa
tion, and this work has been carried on in a careful 
and practical way.
The Paint formulas were all selected and man
ufactured by experts, and no brand of paint has been 
used for advertising or the capitalization of any one 
interest.
The object of this work is to gain absolute 
knowledge based upon practical work; to instruct 
the technical men; to interest the painter; and to 
educate people in general, and thus give to the world 
this knowledge, and by this knowledge we may hope 
to draw certain conclusions which will allow the 
balancing of the good qualities of one pigment 
against the defects of another, and thus produce the 
desired effect.

Manager Scientific Section,

Thepreliminary report of the .Socit of Beaux 
Arts on the drawing rendered March 15th, is not 
so encouraging as the previous report. The judg
ment was indeed severe, but as quite a number have 
no-t been heard from, it is to be hoped there will 
be more mentions returned, as there are but two 
more problems to be given during this school year, 
and these will count considerably in the competition 
for the Hornbostel scholarship. It is to the advant
age of all to work zealously on these charettes.

A Armory drawingsI dont think I could do that 
much in my life.* * S|! *
On Sunday forenoon Powelson and H. E. Smith 
had provided an ample and delicious spread for their 
luncheon, which had been carelessly placed at the 
end of the drawing farthest from the workers. About 
noon Prof. Weber remarked he heard a noise like 
something good to eat, and he smelled the delicious 
aroma of oranges, etc. Upon investigation at the 
other end he discovered several mice had the same 
use of their senses and were noisily diving among 
the papers, sandwiches, fruits, etc. Hence a noise 
like something good to. eat.
Many of the boys wondered how Brandy keeps 
his drawings so scrupulously clean. The great se
cret has been discovered. He draws a line, then 
erases on either side.
A very flattering business transaction was 
brought to light during the last charette; as a result 
King is looking for Webers engagements. Some
body offered him $2.00 for rendering this drawing. 
If there is a higher bidder let him speakto King.

he was the unfortunate who was at the bottom of

Boys, show the true American spirit by coming

Notwithstanding the fact that the celebration 
in honor of the directors return was gotten up and 
led by 1911, the members of 1910 who went along 
tried to prevent the members of other classes from 
dancing in one of the rooms. The display of selfish
ness (perhaps they thought it class spirit) wa? ill 
timed, to say the least, and well merited the scorn 
they received from those whom they tried to impress 
with their importance
* * * *
Wilharm and Munk gave a fine exhibition of 
wrestling last Friday night during Mr. Howards 
absence from the class. There were high kicks 
and high jinks generally for a whole hour.
* * * *
It is understood that 1911 stands back of her 
athletic representative and any action taken by him 
has the endorsement of the whole class.
* * * *
Harley, ex-ll, was seen nosing around the schools 
recently. Hankering to come back, no doubt.
* * * *
Members of the class of 1911, and particularly 
those of Section A, last year will be pained to learn 
of an,accident which befell Mr. Chas. L. T. Edwards, 
their former classmate. Charles Edwards was a 
member of Section A, and stood well in his class 
up to the time he was called to accept a position 
with the Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Co., 
at Enslee, Alabama. It was while in the discharge 
of his duties at work that he became the victim of 
a serious accident which necessitated the amputa
tion of his left foot at the ankle. Edwards will be 
remembered as a doughty gridiron star of his class 
foot-ball team, a popular member of the Mandolin 
Club, a gifted elocutionist and painstaking, diligent 
and successful student. He is a member of the Tau 
Kappa fraternity.
* * * *
In next weeks issue, editor willing and space 
permitting, Mr. Munks promised article on Duel
ling will appear. It will be followed by an article 
by D. G. Morgan on  IronFrom the Mine to the 
Consumer. Mr. Morgan is an able writer, aside from 
being an authority on iron and steel, and his article 
will no doubt prove interesting.

The president, A. F. Stamm, and vice-president,

WHITE FRIARS.
The committee appointed for Ahe purpose of 
finding a suitable play, are unanimous in their de
cision that The Title Mart by Winston Churchill, 
is the best one for production. Mr. Churchill has 
written giving the right to produce it free from any 
royalty. It is published in regular book form by The 
Macmillan Company, New York, and may be had from 
them for 75 cents, prepaid. The action of the play, 
which is a light comedy of the present time, centers 
about a fortune-hunting Lord and his friend, and a 
Lord-hunting American woman.
Members desiring to be considered in making 
up the cast are requested to read the play with a 
view of selecting a part they think they can fill. Af
ter having made it known what part they are candi
dates for, ample opportunity will be given everyone 
to show his ability, and a double cast will finally be 
selected by a faculty committee acting with the offi
cers of the White Friars. Rehearsals trying one 
and then another in the parts will be begun immedi
ately after. As soon as these have gotten to the 
proper point, a professional coach has been prom
ised, who will take things in charge, and make the 
last selection.
The Industrials should remember that they will 
be out of school a month before the time planned 
for its production, but if they can attend the rehear
sals are eligible. Owing to the limited time, some 
of the practicing will have to be done after school 
in the afternoon. It is hoped that the night men 
will not find this a prohibitive requirement. Watch 
the bulletin board for the date of the next meeting.

A SCHOOLBOYS ESSAY ON THE AUTOMOBILE.
Topeka, Kan., has a ten-year-old hopeful whose 
father sternly refuses to help him with his lessons 
or debates. His. name is Wendell Switzer, and he 
attends the Harrison School in that city. That the 
youngster is not sadly in need of coaching is evident 
from the argument he put up the other day in the 
school debate upon the momentous question, Re
solved, That automobiles are more useful to man 
than horses. His support of the affirmative side 
of the question is so original and unique that the 
same is worth publication in full. It is as follows: 
"First, I will mention that automobiles will run 
longer than horses. An automobile does not give 
you nearly as much trouble as horses. Very early 
in t,he -morning you have to get up, dress, and go out 
in the cold and feed your horses, which is not at all 
nice, and then you have to wait a long time till they 
are through eating, which delays you; while an au
tomobile you just have to fill with gasoline the min
ute you want to start. The feed for the automobile, 
which is gasoline, does not cost as much as feed for 
the horses, for the only feed there is for automobiles 
is gasoline, and the horse has to have corn, wheat, 
oats, hay, bran and other things, which raise higher 
and lower, but gasoline never changes its price much

at alk And wheat is so valuable, and so is timothy 
hay, and you hardly ever get good wheat and corn. 
You have to take such good care of your corn or the 
crows will get it. And another thing is, that a horse 
can have only one horsepower, while an automobile 
can have forty or fifty.
If you do net give your horses good food, you 
cannot sell them for a good price, for they get weak 
and sick. Automobiles never get sick, which saves 
trouble. When a horse gets sick it is more liable 
to die /than any other thing. You can get automobiles 
of all sizes, while horses are nearly all one size. 
You have to curry your horses, brush and wash them, 
which takes trouble. One of the hardest things of 
all about horses is training. That is very hard. 
Automobiles don't have to be trained, which saves 
trouble. To train a horse you must nearly risk your 
life, for you do not know what or when the colt is 
going to do. It is a very hard job. When a colt 
is first bridled up it does not know what to do. It 
jumps and rears, kicks, runs, and if you hitch one up 
to a new buggy, there will be nothing left of it, for 
the colt will do everything it can to get the harness 
off. The colt is not used to having harness on, and 
it feels very miserable to him and he wants to get 
it off. The horses scare at street cars and rear up 
and sometimes break the buggy. Automobiles never 
get scared like horses. You have to hollow at the 
horse to make it go, while you just have to turn a 
crank to make an automobile go. An automobile 
tells us how far it has gone, or going, and how 
much gasoline it is using. A horse does not do that. 
It does not tell us how much flesh he is wearing off 
or how much breath it is using and dont tell us how 
far he is going, so we dont know when to stop and 
keep on going and wearing off flesh till the poor 
horse is nothing but skin and bones,' which we call 
a skater, and make fun of the owner. Some people 
do not feed their horses, and drive them so much 
that they drive them to death. You cant run an au
tomobile to death no matter how much you run them, 
which is better.The Automobile.
