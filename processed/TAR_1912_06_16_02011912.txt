GENEVA WINS SECOND.THE UNVEILING OF THE BUST 
OF MR. CARNEGIE IN THE 
MARGARET MORRISON 
CARNEGIE SCHOOL.
One of the most pleasant as well 
as noteworthy events in the history 
of the Schools, was the occasion of 
the unveiling of the bust of Mr. Car
negie in the Margaret Morrison Car
negie School on the afternoon of Jan
uary 20.
The main corridor, with walls newly 
tinted and hung with Michael Angelo 
photographs, was the scene of the 
exercises. The invited audience of 
men and women, prominent in the 
city in education and society, the 
trustees and faculties of the four 
schools gathered about a temporary 
platform, back of which, in the middle 
doorway hung with drapery and out
lined in greens, stood the veiled 
bronze. Director Hamerschlag sat in 
the middle of the half-circle, imme
diately around the object of interest, 
with Judge Reed on his right and 
Judge Buffington on his left; the oth
ers being Mr. Frew, president of the 
board of trustees, and Mrs. Frew, Dr. 
Holland and Mr. Scaife, of the board; 
Mrs. Hamerschlag and Dean West, of 
the Margaret Morrison School.
At a signal from the piano the stu
dents marched by classes down both 
stairways, led by the Seniors, who 
stopped at the bottom steps, leaving 
the stairway filled with girls.
The presentation was made by the 
Honorable James H. Reed, who with 
his wife, is the donor. Mr. Reed spoke 
of the artist, Mr. Rhind, as a friend 
of Mr. Carnegies, who had done his 
work with a sympathetic mind and 
hand; and so far as he knew this was 
the first bust of Mr. Carnegie unveiled 
in a public institution.
Judge Reed humorously replied to 
the Directors introduction of him as 
treasurer of the board of trustees, lest 
any one should draw any inference 
from that fact and his gift, that since 
Mrs. Reed had taken a course in mil
linery at the Margaret Morrison and 
in view of the expense he was saved, 
he was not only grateful but could 
afford to show his gratitude by this 
gift.
The students followed the unveiling 
with The Womans Song, froqi their 
places on the stairs.
The Honorable Joseph Buffington 
responded for the trustees and includ
ed in his thanks an appreciation of the 
noble founder of the Schools, who, the 
speaker said, may not rightly be called 
a self-made man when the influence 
of his mother and his wife are taken 
into account. The bronze image must 
stand as a constant reminder to every 
student that she must pass on to oth
ers what she has learned, as the 
Founder of the School has passed his

MUSKINGUM DOWNED.
In a slow and dreary game, Carne
gie Tech Varsity had no trouble win
ning from Muskingum. Score 30-25. 
The game was played in the Field 
House, Thursday evening, January 25, 
before a small crowd. Owing to the 
shadow of the mid-year exams, little 
noise was heard from the few fans in 
the gallery.
The Plaid players took the ball from 
the hands of the referee and passed 
it swiftly to the basket, where Douthett tossed the sphere into its proper 
place. On the next jump the story 
was repeated, except that more play
ers touched the ball, and Keltz made 
the score. Then the home team loafed 
along, from two to four points ahead 
of their opponents until the intermis
sion, the half ending 13 to 11 in our 
favor.
Coach Ramsdell may have address
ed a few remarks to the players while 
they rested, for they made the game 
almost interesting in the second peri
od.
Heisel was the sensational shooter 
of the game. Both of his baskets were 
made from long shots. He stood in 
the exact center of the floor and se
cured one in the second half, while 
his other one was made from an equal 
distance. Kesselmans guarding was 
the main feature of the contest.

INDUSTRY WRESTLERS WANT 
MATCHES.
The wrestlers in the School of Ap
plied Industry desire to arrange for 
matches with men in the Schools of 
Applied Science and Design. The de
tails of weights, time, and place, can 
be arranged for by seeing J. H. Ran
dolph, upper draftsmen, School of Ap
plied Industries.
The return basketball game with 
Geneva College was played Tuesday 
night, January 23, at Beaver Falls. 
The game was fast and rough with 
the teams almost even. The referee 
was busy in the second half, keeping 
his eyes upon the Pittsburghers so 
much that he aimost forgot the home 
team. With so many free chances, 
the Beaver Falls five won the game in 
the last three minutes on two fouls 
and a field goal, after the Carnegie 
team had led from the intermission. 
Keltz and Douthett played well in the 
front of the floor, while Kesselman 
was the star guard of the four in the 
game. Capt. Nelson starred for Gen
eva, assisted from the foul line by 
Dodds.

TRACK MEN CALLED OUT.
Lumber for the new board track 
has been arriving for the past week, 
and the work of construction is to 
be started immediately. The track 
team management expects everything 
to be ready for actual training by the 
opening of the new semester. Coach 
Ramsdell has asked that every man 
interested in track work report to him 
immediately and make arrangements 
to secure personal advice and coach
ing.
Any man desiring to enter the Y. 
M. C. A. meet at Duquesne Garden 
on Febraury 16, will be given an op
portunity to try out. The efforts of 
the coaches will be bent upon getting 
the men into shape for the big P. A. 
A. indoor meet on March 9. This 
meet will be the main athletic affair 
of the indoor season, and the track! 
team expects to show superiority over 
other colleges that will be entered.
The complete track schedule will 
be announced in the course of a few 
weeks.
DEAN WEST MAKES ADDRESS 
BEFORE ERIE CHAMBER OF 
COMMERCE.
Dean West delivered an address to 
a large audience at the Erie Chamber 
of Commerce last week. The people 
of Erie are much interested at present 
in education in its many phases and 
it was upon this subject that Dean 
West spoke.
Dean West advocates higher educa
tion for women, but said that the col
lege course should be preceded by 
home training. Women under the 
new educational training they are re
ceiving in the technical schools may 
take up any of the problems of mu
nicipal and civic organizations. The 
prospect of the future points to the 
time when women will enter into the 
business world as capably and effec
tively as men, but nevertheless the 
real sphere of women is in the home, 
said the speaker.

NIGHT PREP.
Smoking Room Proposition Favorably 
Accepted.
On Wednesday, January 24, a meet
ing of the Night Preps was called by 
President E. J. McCarthy in Room 
209, at 10:30 P. M.
The president then gave a little talk 
in which he discussed the organization 
of the class and the probability of a 
dance or a smoker, whicii he hoped 
could be arranged to take place in the 
near future.
The election of section representa
tives was then taken up, which result
ed in the following men being elected 
tcf represent their respective sections:
Section AJ. M. Parke.
Section BT. A. Hughes.
Section CC. Walker.
Section D and EJ. E. Morgan.
The much discussed smoking room 
proposition was then taken up, and 
after a short discussion, the members 
expressed their enthusiasm in a mo
tion which was made and carried, to 
accept this proposition.
There being no further business on 
hand, the meeting was adjourned.

It has been called to our attention 
that the walls of some of the club 
rooms about the buildings have be
come soiled and much written upon. 
It hardly seems possible that in our 
institution we have students with so 
little intellect and the sense of de
cency so undeveloped as to make this 
a state of affairs possible. If we were 
running a school for street boys who 
knew no better, we should expect such 
things and prepare for them. Here, 
however, we expect the students to be 
men enough and to have a sense of the 
value of the things which they are 
permitted to enjoy, as to cause them 
to refrain from acts of scandalism, no 
matter what their instincts may be. 
This is a matter which should be 
taken up at once by the committees in 
charge of the various rooms in which 
the results of such acts are to be 
seen and the offenders given the pun
ishment they deserve.
-----------------o-----------------
COLLEGE PRIDE.
There is a something which in
vades the heart of every college man 
after he graduates from school, so 
that every time he hears his Alma 
Mater mentioned he feels a proud en
thusiastic sensation within him. Yet 
how many men who have received 
their diplomas really deserve this feel
ing? There are men and women who 
enter the doors of this institution both 
during the broad daylight and during 
the night hours, who merely attend 
classes and pay no attention whatso
ever to any activities of the college 
main life. These people never have 
and do not deserve that feeling of 
Pride which enters into the heart of 
the man who can say that he has done 
something for his schoolno matter 
how little.
The Thistle preserves for all time 
the names and records of people who 
do things about school, yet there are 
even some people who say they are 
not interested enough in their school
to subscribe to the school annual.
Many excuses are given that it costs 
too much money, yet these same peo
ple are the ones who are seen regu
larly at the various theatres, and who 
spend more money foolishly in a 
month than would buy two Thistles.
The Thistle does not beg subscrip
tions, but it merely appeals to every 
man and womans sense of Pride in 
their Alma Mater to make the Thistle 
a real Year Book of these Carnegie 
Technical Schools.
Does 275 subscriptions 'n a school 
where 2,400 students are enrolled, 
mean anything to you? Wouldnt
1,500 sound better?

The recent examinations produced 
some very funny answers to very sim
ple questions. If the queerness of 
the answers increases directly as the 
stiffness of the questions, some of the 
examinations must have produced side 
splitting results.
In answer to the question State 
some of the uses of the pendulum, 
a class in prep physics found time to 
evolve the following pieces of original 
research work: It is useful in finding 
the specific gravity of any commun
ity; and Also used by music teach
ers to teach pupils how to make har
mony. In answer to the question: 
How is a quantity of heat measured?
one future Kelvin remarked that it 
was done by placing a thermometer 
partly filled with mercury in the sub
stance to be measuredwhere it could 
catch the steam or vapor and regis
ter.
When asked, How can you show 
experimentally that sound is transmit
ted by the air and not by ether? the 
answer was given that ether was too 
dense to transmit air. When asked 
how to prove experimentally that 
sound waves could be reflected an
other member of the same class was 
certain it could be done by fastening 
a piece of looking glass on one prong 
of a tuning fork, and let it reflect the 
light while on, after the fork has been 
struck.
The nearest that some members 
came to having and knowledge about 
a vacuum was the vacuum in the head, 
as is shown by the answers to If a 
rifle bullet were shot directly upward 
with a velocity of 1,000 feet per sec
ond, how far would it rise if in a 
vacuum? The first was sure that it 
wouldnt start, a second that it 
would never stop, while a third tried 
to slide between extremes by saying 
that it depends on how hard the 
hammer is struck.
* * *
Prof Cannon (in Lecture)And 
today they have doubled the size of 
that power-house without enlarging 
it a bit. How such a thing could be 
done even in this enlightened age, 
would be a hard problem to figure, 
even with a slide-rule.
* * *
Boston Tech has adopted the point 
system in office holding. Each of
fice connected in any way with school 
activities is evaluated. When a man 
has ten points he is ineligible to hold 
any office within the schools; he may 
however, take part in athletics. The 
presidency of the Senior Class counts 
ten points. Therefore, no man who 
has ever held office in his first three 
years of school can become Senior 
president. This system may be vision
ary, but the outcome is awaited with 
interest.

ONE OF THE BOYS ANSWERS 
WHATS WHAT AND HOW.
The following communication in an
swering to the Whats How and 
Why column of two weeks ago was 
received, but on account of shortage 
of space, was held until this issue.
Every truly great literary effort 
falls naturally into the hands of the 
critic and following time-honored 
custom we make free to remark on 
Whats What and How of the last 
issue.
Efforts to discover the sublime in
tellect that originated that vivacious 
and sparkling column were unavail
ing.
Our highly appreciative perusal of 
this production discloses a veritable 
treasure trove of humor and provokes 
a reproof to the Schools that such a 
colossal brain had been suffered to 
ferment so long under its bushel bas
ket.
We do not vouch for the simile. 
The subject of the article seems to be 
after a study of its etymological 
labyrinthsthe Artistic Tempera
ment which sits heavily on the liver 
of the author. By way of ventilating 
his views he passes through a series 
of verbal gymnastics that would do 
credit to a Toveador and qualify him 
for a mere Banderilledo on the spot.
The charming and engaging style 
of his composition is evidenced by his 
naivette in referring to his alliterative 
researches in the columns of the 
Standard Dictionary, which certainly 
speaks well for his tenacity and perse
verance, although the hypercritical 
may take exception to the opaqueness 
of his diction presuming him to con
verse in the ordinary walks of life 
in a manner so Johnsonian. We must 
reserve our approval in regard to the 
pun on Hallelujah, always granting 
that occasionally such equine, not to 
say vulgar, wit is permissable if ju
diciously introduced.
After assorting and tabulating his 
thesanvical data we infer that he could 
not refrain from inserting that delic
ious bit of humor, the canard con
cerning the yearly and half-yearly mi
gration of the Blues to the Reds. 
Conceding in advance that to be per
petually in the Blues is some basis 
for the story, we must say in slight 
criticis-m that the falsity of the state
ment is so obvious to all except the 
mentally defective that any allusion 
to it was superfluous even for its 
ludicrous merit.
However, he scores a palpable hit in 
the reference to ladylike, etc. The 
unanswerable fact that the Tempera
mental Ones pay unseasonable atten
tion to personal linen,and are averse 
to carrying all the available real es
tate in their finger nailsafter the 
genial and economical habit in other 
quartersfastens the authors adjec
tive upon them and leaves them pil
loried to scorn and contumely.
His admirable climax beginning 
When administered calls forth un
stinted praise in the unrivaled imag
ination displayed in the choice and 
juxtaposition of such volumes of 
grammatical construction as would 
shame a Milton, and achieving a lucid 
conciseness only to be compared in 
clarity to the Father of Waters.
As an airy finale, a choice bit of 
French is introducedat least we beg 
to presume it French, although #our 
erudition in that language is so de
fective as to make us defer to the 
general public for a translation of 
soi distant. The tenor of the para
graph seems to indicate that it is a 
delicately conceived tribute to the 
much discussed Temperament, but a 
hasty canvass of six French lexicons 
fails to disclose its true meaning. 
Space, or to be exact, the lack of it, 
prevents further discussion of the 
remarkable bit of satirical humor, let 
us only congratulate the happy writer 
and wish him well. We fear, how
ever, his talents are wasted as ex
tended excursions in the journalistic 
arena might lure the wise ones from 
their logarithmsand lo! the world 
cease to revolve.

4THE TARTAN
THE NEW BUILDINGS.
Building Bureau Working Hard.
It is with pleasure that The Tartan 
is able to announce that work on the 
new School of Applied Design, Build
ing has actually begun. Contracts 
have been signed for a building, to 
cost approximately $450,000, and the 
work of breaking ground for the foun
dations started last week. When the 
building is completed it will be ap
proximately 230 feet long by 126 feet 
deep. There is to be no general con
tractor, Dean Hornbostel of the 
School of Applied Design having en
tire charge of the erection as well 
as the designing. A perspective view 
cf the building is shown in this issue. 
Not all of this will be erected at pres
ent, however, the wings at either end 
of the building to be reserved for 
further study, will be erected later.
The front facade shows five large 
niches, each 15 feet wide and 25 feet 
high, representing the History of Ar
chitecture. Each niche will represent 
a different style of architecture. The 
center niche, which is also the main 
entrance, is done in Roman, on either 
side of this is a niche, one represent
ing Byzantine and the other Greek, 
while the end niches represent Gothic 
and Renaissance respectively. Within 
each of these niches there will be 
found five small niches treated dif
ferently, showing the epochs of each 
style so that the whole is illustrative 
of the worlds history of architecture. 
These are to be very elaborately 
carved in stone.
In tront of the building is a large 
terrace of brick and granite which 
will serve as a point of meeting for 
students. Passing into the building 
we step into large stone vaulted ves
tibule, 30 feet by 40 feet, 38 feet high. 
At either side entrances lead into an 
exhibition room for the students and 
an assembly hall. This assembly hall 
is elliptical in shape, finished entirely 
in oak, with a place for a norgan, also 
a stage with boxes on either side. The 
exhibition hall at the left, on entering, 
is a large room designed for the ex
hibition of students work.
Leading up from the vestibule is a 
broad stair, on the landing of which 
occur rooms for the permanent exhi
bition of students work. Continuing 
on up the stairs we come into a big 
atrium 150 feet long, 24 feet wide and
26 feet high, off of which will be the 
class rooms. This atrium and the ves
tibule are of stone, with marble floors 
and vaulted ceilings. Along this at
rium are exhibited various examples 
of art, such as paintings fragments 
of architecture, sculpture, etc. On 
the south side of this atrium are the 
doors opening into the class-rooms 
and at either end are the two stair
cases which go up to the mezzaine 
floor, where the library and offices 
will be located.
The second floor will be .taken up 
principally with a large drafting room 
for the architects. The front part of 
the third floor will be occupied by 
tteiiers for the painters, decorators 
and illustrators while in the back will 
be a line of studios, perfect in ap
pointment with north light. At one 
end of the third floor there is a rest
room for the girl students. In the 
loft above are lodges for the archi
tects where they will take their 12 and 
24 hour sketches. In the basement 
will be located the department of 
sculpture, locker rooms and for the 
present a few class rooms.
The entire atmosphere of the first 
floor is that of a museum while the 
architecture itself differs widely so as 
to reproduce as many different styles 
as possible, thus illustrating to the 
student, as much as possible, what 
architecture really is. The doors, 
door frames, etc., are designed after 
tamous doors, etc., n historic art.
New Machinery Hall.
Plans are now being prepared by 
the Building Bureau for the comple
tion of Machinery Hall of the Science 
group. Two additional stories will be 
built on top of the present structure, 
an addition to the present building 
will be built, approximately 90 by 50 
feet, for the use of the Electrical De
partment as a laboratory, and the
present boiler room enlarged. When 
completed this building will house the! 
entire Mechanical and Electrical Dej 
partments. The laboratories will be 
designed as work-shops, pure and 
simple. A new Hydraulic Laboratory 
for the Civil Department is also i 
planned for the near future.
Studies are also being made for the 
bridge to Morewood avenue and it 
is hoped to push this work forward 
as rapidly s possible.
The Athletic Field is now filled to 
the required level, but as there is con
siderable work yet to be done on it, 
it is not likely that the field will be 
ready for athletic contests until late 
in the Fall.
Now that the removal of the 'hump" 
is completed, the superintendent of 
grounds has his first opportunity to 
improve the appearance of this part 
of the school property and put the 
future court in something like its ul
timate shape. The temporary build
ings, such as the barn, carpenter shop,
paper storehouse, etc., wiil shortly be 
removed from sight and the grounds 
grade, filled in and sewn for grass.
With the new Design Building 
looming up at the top of the hill, and 
Machinery Hall finished off and the 
grounds graded and sodded, Carnegie 
Tech will soon begin to take on a new 
appearance.

SURGERY OF THE SCISSORS.
SQUEEDUNKS VS. 
ALLAMAZOOS.
Well, if those conceited Plebes think 
that all the Juniors can find to do 
these days is to play jokes on lower 
classmen, they deserve to get stungK
The beautiful basketball game cer
tainly was a right, rapid, rattling, 
remorseless one as was scheduled on 
the board. Remorseless? You just 
bet it was. The substitute Johnston 
was kept busy with her little basin 
and sponge nearly all the time. Dur
ing the first half two players had to 
be carried from the floor and the game 
was delayed until they had sufficientyl 
recovered to continue playing.
The second half began with a grand 
march and a song entitled, Hail, Hail, 
The Gangs All Here. Three players 
were exhausted this half and one o'i 
the Squeedunk guards gave an Allamazoo forward an upperent on the 
nose. If you dont believe it, ask Miss 
Little to show it to you.
The costumes were remarkable and 
the players looked like pirates, gyp
sies, baseball players and goodness 
knows what else. Red stockings, blue 
stockings, tan stockings, pink stock
ings, white stockings and polka-dotted 
stockings were all very much in vogue 
and were worn by the players. The 
Squeedunks were designated by the 
blue bows on their heads and the large 
letter S on their backs from the 
Allamazoos, who wore red bows and 
As.
The last scene was very touching 
and pathetic, especially when the two 
teams marched together and each 
Squeedunk embraced a sister Allamazoo. The final score was: Squeedunks, 
6; Allamazoos, 23
Maybe those Plebes will not be so 
conceited after this.
The wife of a prominent lawyer in 
a Western city was ordered by her 
physician to a sanitarium for treat
ment in preparation for a surgical 
operation.
Her husband saw her safely estab
lished at the hospital, with her sister 
and maid in attendance, to do some 
necessary sewing for the invalid; then 
he departed on a short business trip, 
with strict instructions to the doctor 
not to perform the operat:on until his 
return.
Upon receipt of the first letter from 
his wife he returned post-haste, and, 
encountering the doctor at the hos
pital door, angrily demanded to know 
why the operation had been performed 
before notifying him.
Your wife has undergone no oper
ation to my knowledge, replied the 
puzzled physician.
Then what does this letter mean? 
demanded the lawyer, and produced 
the alarming document, which read:
Dear Joe:I am so glad you 
brought me here before you left. 
Everybody is so nice to me, here. 
They cut out my kimono yesterday, 
and had it all sewed up before I knew 
anything about it. I am feeling better 
already.

The Carnegie alumni and students 
are looking forward with much an
ticipation to the Home Concert of the 
Musical Clubs at the Carnegie Music 
Hall, on March 7th.
The clubs, Glee and Mandolin, 
eclipsed all preceding concerts when 
they held their Home Concert last 
year.
With the same directors and with 
nearly all of last years men, this 
years clubs will be the best that have 
ever represented Carnegie. In addi
tion to a number of popular foreign 
airs, the Glee and Mandolin men are 
playing a piece of Director Scalzos 
own composition and such classical 
music as the Fantasia Aus Tell.
The Glee Club, under Director Mc
Dowell, are prepared with a lot of 
good selections including some very 
funny ones.
The quarteete, selected from 50 
good singers, also have several good 
numbers, and are well prepared to 
render them.
Get ready to take the best girl in 
the world.

6THE TARTAN
WHATS WHAT AND HOW. j
If the non-athletic instructor will 
drop into the gymnasium any after
noon after 4 oclock he will witness 
a moving picture of the educational 
problem, or if you please, a picture of 
the moving educational problem, sev
eral problems in fact, from an angle 
rather more acute than the one from 
which he usually views it. It would 
drown the physics department in grat
ified tears, to see the cyclonic en
thusiasm with which the devoted dis
ciples of basket ball apply the law of 
incidence and reflection, when they 
are not massaging each others faces 
with knees and elbows, or making 
playful attempts to push each others 
wishbones out throug their backs. A 
further acquaintance with the cere
monies peculiar to this shrine of mus
cle, and with the unfettered converse 
of the locker room, would reveal 
pedagogical bypaths that are not 
down on the educational map, and 
while unpaved are doubtless pleasant 
to the feet.
The frantic Marathon for Cs that 
is instituted and chaperoned by the 
Faculty, enjoys its feverish popular
ity, it would appear, from the private 
interpretation placed upon this scho
lastic event by the agonizing student. 
The Cs that he is so piously chasing 
to cover are by no means the silly 
little symbols with which the Deans 
fritter away their august time, but 
the resplendent insignia with which 
the worshipful athletic association 
adorns his protuberant bosom.
There also may be observed the 
erstwhile dejected figure that formed 
a limp drapery for the penitential 
chair in the recitation room, career
ing wildly up and down the arena; 
eyes like arc lamps, the mouth that 
was so meekly voiceless discharging 
volleys of maniacal shrieks festooned 
with shreds of chewing gum, while 
ears that have visibly elongated with 
daily reaching for the first tinkle of 
the hourly emancipating gong, are 
deaf now even to the dinner bell. 
Oh! this course in applied (we are 
fond of the word applied) dynam
ics at the Gym is popular. A wierd 
psychological problem is this student. 
He will risk each or all of the 208 
bones in his anatomy, or pull his mus
cles loose from their moorings in 
the noble enterprise of tacking a rag, 
delirious with fantastic symbols, to the 
most inaccessibly projecting point, 
but he wont imperil the stability of 
a suspender button to reach his reci
tation on time, nor can he, when un
happily there, keep awake long 
enough to get the worth of his 
money, altho he will remain wide 
awake until dawn, devising a com
plicated plan by which he can evade 
a 30-minute task.
He will live on 'evaporated egg
shells and sterilized dandelions, pass 
death-dealing restaurant concoctions 
to his fellow-students, play wet nurse 
to professorial furnaces, in order to 
pgy his tuition expenses, and if his 
instructor is 2l/2 minutes late in ar
riving at recitation, will if necessary 
jump from a second story window to
escape him. He paid for that reci
tation with the knees of his trousers 
and the skin of his hands, and if he 
wants to give it away, why thats his 
business, why, sure. With his fellow 
rooters on bleacher or sideline, he 
prays to his gods, engaged in titanic 
strife on the gridiron or diamond, 
in tones that raise water blisters on 
the empyrean. A barbarous perform
ance, no doubt, but made wholly ad
mirable and inspiring by the stimu
lus of the blood-boiling struggle be
low and his glorified pride in the 
prowess of his heroes, and thenhe 
sells his divine fire to a theatrical gold 
brick artist in a paltry orgy of cater
wauls for a paltry cup. Makes a 
braying ass of himself and gets not 
a mite of rebate for the prostitution 
of his sacred enthusiasm.
He is unbelievably, uncannily 
shrewd; he is inconceivably imbecile.
He has an X-ray eye for the frail
ties of his instructors; spots them 
with unerring accuracy. Nothing is 
hid from him among the most inti
mate and darling weaknesses of his 
guides along wisdoms ways, not even 
breaches in the integrity of their hos
iery; he laughs, loyally, at the stories 
Adam invented, told to the serpent, 
and was in consequence expelled 
from Eden; he simulates a passionate 
interest in some mighty question, that 
should be clear to a puling infant, 
that he may paddle idly in the stream 
of his instructors misguided elo
quence.
He is a comic opera god on a papier 
mache Olympus, to whom nothing is 
real except the unrealties of his con
gested imagination, and who regards 
the ostensibly serious world of men 
with Homeric laughter.
