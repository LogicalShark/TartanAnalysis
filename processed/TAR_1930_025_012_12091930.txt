PLAIDS DOMINATE PLAY
Seniors Make Fine Stand 
in Final Role As 
Gridders
By Joe Michaelson 
Carnegies decisive 26-0 victory in 
\ the time-honored clash with WashI Jeff on the gridiron last Saturdayi
narks *i turning point in the foot>all history of these twp ancient 
rivals. If the score columns of the 
last thrc2 years could speak they 
-would tell that the Presidential jinx 
has finally been buried, but only 
after 25 years of up-hill fighting on 
the part of the Tartans.
Although the bad. weather did 
limit the crowd to a measurably 
number, it did jiot dampen the play 
of the athletes'. Both teams fought 
with genuine eagerness to prolong 
their number of seasoned victories. 
During the first half the Pr.oxys of
fered a good..defens: which finally 
gave way to the superior Tartan at
tacks, but throughout the game the 
morale of the W. & J. boy's was 
never at a low ebb. Knowing they 
were licked, the Red and Black 
fought all the harder, and thus 
minimized the thought of a de
cisive defeat.
Seniors Play Well 
Last Saturday's fracus was an ap
propriate graduating exercise for the 
hand-full of Carnegie's senior grid 
stars./Each of thqse players 'pre
formed in such a manner that is a 
lasting! tribute to the coaching of 
Steffan and Waddell. Kaj-cis will al
ways be remembered for stopping the 
oijppsjng backs at the line of scrim"mage with a definite thud 'and 
crashing off either tackle for-'a consistant gain, Eyth for shifting up to 
the end with a sudden dart through 
the hole fomore yardage,- Roscnzweig and Flanagan for chasing down 
the field under a punt to destroy 
the safcty-mans intentions of ad
vancing, Highberger an< Schnuppc for 
dismantling the interference and for 
finally bringing the ball-totcr to earth, 
and Captain Dreshar for piling up 
plays in the middle of the line and 
for matching coins with the umpires.
Wilson Proves T,hrcat 
The team from Little Washington 
was the victim of these circumstances 
and consequently those 'hocus-pocus 
plays of Bill Amos often failed to 
reach the line. However, a few W. 
& J. criss-cross plays did prove 
profitable for the visitors. Stew 
Wilson, at fullback for the Presi
dents was a dangerous threat on 
the offense in more ways than one. 
Stew carried the pigskin on fre
quent gains and was most success-, 
ful in getting off long punts at the 
critical time. McNeil, left end for 
W, & J., played an air tight game-which forced the Skibos to: run their 
scoring plays through some hole 
that he could not reach.

VICTOR CHENKIN 
Russian Singing Actor to Visit 
s Pittsburgh
MUSIC HALL SCENE 
OF CHENKIN RECITAL
Noted Baritone Character 
Singer to Appear 
December 18
On the evening of December 18 
music-loving Pittsburghers will be 
afforded the rare opportunity of 
hearing Victor Chcnkin, internation
ally known baritone character sing
er, who will appear at the Carnegie 
Music Hall in a series of dramatic 
songs.
Chcnkin is regarded by all the 
leading critics in the United States 
and Europe as the worlds greatest 
living baritone. His repertoire in 
eludes .songs and characterization of 
many ..continental, nations, his .types 
being original representatives of the 
respective countries. He easily 
masters Russian, Ukrainian, Cau
casian, Gypsy, Italian, French, Ger
man, and Jewish Khassidic, each 
of which is represented by their 
characteristic songs.
An artist possessed of amazing 
magnetism Chcnkin has .a real gift 
of mimicry. He can slip from the 
garb of one country to that of 
another with such celerity . arid 
variety of characterization, that one 
doubts that the same man is capable 
of assuming so many different 
guises. Yet lie adopt* and por
trays each new role with faithful 
ness, adhering closely to the local 
dialect and costume.

Mortar Board Holds'
Tea Dance In Union 
Tomorrow Afternoon
Jerry McGcorgc and his seven 
piece daiicc orchestra have prepared 
a choice selection of popular dance 
hits for their appearance, -at the 
Mortar Board, Tea Dancc,, on Wed
nesday^ December 10. The -orchestra 
nceds. no introduction. on., the cam
pus, and Whejv they appear at the 
dance to be held in the Union 
from 4:30 to 6:30 p.m., .they will 
be playing at the outstanding aft
ernoon social event of the sea
son.
Tickets, for the dance are now 
being sold by members of the 
Mortar Board at. the price of 25 
cents. - They may be secured also 
at the Union the day .of the dance.
Mortar Board has selec.ted Wed
nesday as the date of its. ,dance, 
for it has been learned that . that 
day is a more convenient .time for 
a student social event than Thurs
day, the former .tea dance after
noon; consequently, a large crowd 
is expected.
Introducing  Mr. Thomas Emil 
Hopkins, compiler, publisher, agent, 
hardboilcd businessman  Scotchman 
extraordinary. Indeed, Mr. Hopkins 
is one commercial engineer who, 
when such classes as he may attend 
are done, takes off his coat, rolls 
up his sleeves, and sets >to work. 
Wc can show you pictures to prove 
it.
For Hopkins, together with. V. 
Everett Kinsey, Pitt Senior, owns, 
operates, and directs the activities 
of the Amcric n Compilation com
pany, the chief production of which 
has been a cross-indexed, volume of 
365 pages of small type entitled An 
Index to the Steel Patents of the 
United States. The book 'lists about 
1,800 patents on all metals contain
ing five or more parts of iron to 
the hundred, and represents several 
months of tedious sorting and classi
fying of some two or three thou
sand patent briefs by the boys.
The enterprise started last April 
when one of the large steel com
panies here engaged the firm of 
patent lawrycrs for w'hom Kinsey 
worked to review some thousand 
briefs. The result proved very ex
pensive and unsatisfactory. Where
upon Hopkins and Kinsey conceived 
the idea of a reference book to in
dex all patents on metallurgical pro
cesses used in iron and steel manu
facture. They promptly went to work, 
securing briefs of patents ' fromthe 
Government Patent Office, the Car
negie Library, and law firms.
The book, which they published 
and. marketed themselves, has proved 
unusually popular with steel com
panies, ' law firms, and research 
bureaus, w-ho praise it as a medium 
which will save them money, time, 
and laborious hours of research. 
With all the patents indexed and 
cross-indexed, the book makes easier 
searches for titles, metals, manu
facturers.
Since the unexpected success of 
this first book, the boys have de
cided ,to compile a second on nickel 
and its alloys. To both books they 
are planning to 'add yearly supple
ments.
And, says this energetic repre
sentative of those much maligned 
commercials, if you dont think in
dexing is W-O-R-K, just try it 
yourself.
American Painter 
Gets Popular Prize 
In Carnegie Exhibit
Award Based on Votes of 
Visitors to Exhibit in 
Past Weeks
Leopold Scyffcrt, American artist,

his painting, Portrait of Marion 
Eckhart, in the Twenty-ninth Car
negie Institute International Exhibi
tion, according to announcement made 
Sunday', November 30 at the Insti
tute. This is the seventh year in suc
cession that this prize has been w'on

ond time that Mr. Scyffcrt has won 
it. In 1926, in the Twenty-fifth In
ternational, his painting Rose and 
Silver . received the Popular Prize.

The closest competitors of the prize 
painting, in order of their prefer
ence, were "Madonna of the Cotton 
Fields, by Laura Knight, The 
Sphinx,. by Gerald Kelly, Ballet 
Girl and Dressmaker, also by Laura 
Knight, and Portrait of the Four 
Sons of Mr. and Mrs. Roy Arthur 
Hunt, by Antonio Ortiz Echaguc.
Tie award was based on the votes 
of visitors to the Exhibition during 
the past two weeks.. Each visitor was 
given a ballot and ask^d to vote for 
the painting in the Exhibition which 
lie liked best. All the paintings in 
the show this year were eligible for 
the prize with the exception of five. 
The object of the prize offered by 
the Fine Arts Committee, is to 
stimulate interest in the Exhibition, 
to encourage visitorsto study the 
paintings and to exprcs^ their opin
ions after their own standards of 
criticism.
Former Pittsburgh Student 
Leopold Seyffcrt is one of Amer
ica's most well known portrait pain
ters. He was bo-n in California, 
Missouri, in 1888. Hv began his 
studies in Colorado under La Tallc. 
Later he came to Pittsburgh where 
he studied at' the old Stevenson Art 
Schoo}. At the Pennsylvania Academy

Something New 
And Different in 
Drama Is Staged
La Princesse Lointaine 
of Rostand Opens 
Tonight
It is seldom that playgoers arc 
privileged to enjoy such an unusual 
production as opens tonight at the 
Little Theater. It is Edmund 
Rostands La Princesse Lointaine, 
staged by Boris Glagolin, the guest 
direc,tor.
Tlid author, Rostand, has based 
his play on the trait of human na
ture that everyone at sometime or 
other is seeking for an ideal, for 
something beyond and 'remote, for 
his. faraway princess. It is an 
allegory, an imaginative drama, the 
production of which is being based 
on the translation of John Heard, 
Jr. In the play; Mr. Glagolin said 
in an interview given last w,eck, 
that he is appealing to the soul of 
the audience, and through imagina
tion, the members can not help but 
become an'^ntcgral part of the play. 
Here is one of. the fundamentals 
of Constructivism, the name of Mr. 
Glagolins particular type of direct
ing. He tells us that in the more 
usualstage production, theatrical 
illusion is indispcnsiblc. In con
structivist treatment there is no 
place for such a thing; For, to 
quote Glagolin, "Constructivism is 
Realism. Realism is the basis of 
life, and the human body, then, is 
the medium through which this 
technique transfers its moods, its 
feelings, and ideas to the audience. 
He says that in this play Rostand 
is depicting his belief in the dual 
form of human nature, the spiritual 
and the animal. But Constructiv
ism cannot believe in these two, 
thus contrasting Romanticism and 
Constructivism in art. Glagolin 
brings this contrast out. A chorus, 
somewhat on the same - order of 
the chorus in the ancient 'Greek 
plays, is used to ccho the mood of 
the actors which is further helped 
by music from Bach and Wagner. 
This crcatcj a rhythm,- but construc(Continued on Page Three)

Years Hop
This years . Soph Hop, which 
promises to be -the biggest and best 
ever held at Carnegie, will be staged 
this Friday' in the Georgian Room of 
Webster Hall. The High Hatters, 
nationally famous and justly re
nowned Victor Recording and Na
tional Broadcasting Company orches
tra, has been persuaded to leave New 
York for the first time to play for a 
collcgiatc function.
Formerly they have been forced to 
remain in New York because of their 
extensive broadcasting and record

featured daily over both coast-tocoast hookups of the National Broad
casting company and have made a 
great number of Victor records.
Novel Programs
Th'c programs for this years dancc 
have been specially designed for Ihe 
occasion and arc radically different 
from the conventional type used at 
Carnegie danccs in the past. The 
covcr is in silver and black, and the 
printed matter is of a modernistic 
character. The decorations will also 
take a new note this year. In 
addition to the usual school banners 
and pennants, special class banners 
will be used for the first time. Ar
rangements have been made with the

PAGE TWOTHE CARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY, DECEMBER 0, 1930.
ALUMNI NEWS
THE PAST SEASON WAS FAR FROM A FAILURE 
despite the three defeats the Skibos suffered. Rockne himself 
admits that the Carnegie gamfe was one of the toughest his 
team played and if anyone were to ask Doc Sutherland if his 
Panthers had an easy time of it against the Scots, its our guess 
he wouldnt answer in the affirmative. The fact that during 
the past season Carnegie had one of the outstanding offensive 
combinations in the country is shown by the fact that they 
scored against every team they met on what was one of the 
most ambitious schedules any Carnegie team has ever tackled. 
In matter of points scored the Plaid team was among the na
tional leaders and their, record of seventy-five points scored in 
the Buffalo contest, although surpassed in several other college 
contests, represents one of the largest scores compiled by a 
Class A team in a single game.
* * * * *
DUTCH EYTHS ELECTION TO THE HONORARY 
CAPTAINCY for the 30 season is a true expression of the 
high esteem he had won not only among his, teammates, but
but also among Carnegie grid followers. "Dutch played out
standing ball all season and was the teams leading scorer. 
His dash for a touchdown against Notre Dame was one of 
the longest runs made against the undefeated Irish squad. 
Eyths fine play has gained him recognition on a number of 
All-American selections.
F F R I F F
CARNEGIE WILL AGAIN BE REPRESENT
ED on the All-East team, selected each year by 
Andy Kerr and Dick Hanley. Ted Rosenzweig, veteran left-end, has been extended a bid 
to play in the Shriners benefit game for orphans 
at San Francisco, December 27. Although two 
full teams will be selected to make the trip, it 
is probable that Rosenzweig will take first-string 
care of the left-wing position in that he is one 
of the few now chosen.
To receive an invitation to join the All-East
erners is not only a worthy individual honor to
_____________ Ted, but also an honor to Carnegie. This
years selection of a Tartan is the first since 28, 
when Harpster, Sweet, and Letzelter were called. Incidentally, 
the All-East combine won that year, 21-0.

SEVEN CONSECUTIVE MAJOR GAMES is the un
enviable task mapped out for the 19.31 Football team. The 
only minor contest on the schedule is the opener with Buffalo 
which is followed on successive Saturdays by games with 
W. & J. and Georgia Tech. Then after a breathing spell the 
team will attempt to trim 'Purdue, Notre Dame, Pitt, and 
Temple on consecutive Saturdays. The schedule is concluded 
with a Thanksgiving day game against New York U. If the 
boys come through this difficult schedule without defeat they 
will probably find themselves in the Rose Bowl January 1, 1032.

The hardest football campaign 
ever mapped out for a Carnegie 
Tech gridiron aggregation must 
be tackled by the Tartans in 1931, 
according to next years schedule, 
which lias been announced by 
Graduate Manager Clarence Overend. The card shows but eight 
games, bw there is only one con
test with a club that is not of 
distinctly major caliber.
Starting with W. & J. on Octo
ber 3, the Plaid will swing through 
an-array of games that will send 
her against Georgia Tech in the 
South, Purdue and Notre Dame 
of the middle West, and New York 
University and Temple University 
of Eastern circles.
Thiel and Western Reserve, who 
were met in 1930, have been 
dropped from the schedule tem
porarily. Purdue is absolutely a 
newcomer, the Boiler Makers and 
the Skibos never having previously 
met. When this game was sched
uled, Purdue was the champion of 
the Western Conferonce.
Four of the games will be play
ed at home and four on the road. 
The home battles will throw Car
negie against W. & % Purdue,
Notre Dame and the University of 
Pittsburgh.
Again the Tartans will open 
with the University of Buffalo at 
Buffalo, and this is the only 1931 
game that promises to be -easy. 
Even such a rating of the Buffalo 
team holds only in case the north
ern New Yorkers show no im
provement over their 1930 form.

wo.uld be followed again this year, 
but with the banquet coming on 
the same day as the final football 
game, the coaches decided not to

The Alumni Dollar Day which

25, is progressing most successful
ly. The list of subscribers number 
over 200, and nearly .$350 has been 
raised. Though the standard of $600, 
set by the first drive in 1927, has 
not yet been reached, there is still 
time if all alumni who have not 
made contributions  send in their 
money as soon as possible to the 
Alumni office.
Many alumni have not limited 
their contributions to one dollar, 
but have sent in two, three or 
five dollars. One man had a rath
er clever idea. His contribution 
was $1.25. .He explained that the 
dollar was for the drive and the 25 
cents was for Carnegies twentyfifth anniversarya penny for each 
year.

Assistance Of Alumni 
Requested By Bureau 
Of Recommendations
The Bureau of Recommenda
tions wishes to remind alumni of 
the opportunities presented them 
assisting fellow alumni and stu
dents of Carnegie in securing po
sitions. The Bureau has been 
aided materially in the past by the 
co-operation of alumni, and at 
times like the present, such assist
ance is, doubly valuable.
Often alumni, especially those 
who have been out of school for 
some time, and are holding re
sponsible positions,J hear of )pen-: 
ings in their own ^organization 
which can be filled by a graduate 
or night student of Carnegie. Or 
perhaps the position may be va
cant in some other organization 
with which you are acquainted. 
Information on any type of work 
whatsoever, cither permanent or 
temporary, will be appreciated by 
the Bureau...
Conditions among our alumni 
are quite favorable at the present 
time, few' men being out of work 
entirely, and those who have been 
reftased have usually been able 
to find something, at least of a 
temporary nature. The demand 
for the college trained man holds 
up well, even in times of depressed 
business conditions.
There arc available at the pres
ent time a lafge number of night 
students, who are willing to do 
most any type of work, many of 
them being married, and conscien
tious workers. Day students are 
also, available for part time work.
Any information which alumni 
wish to submit should be address

"I see by the papers that the 
Alumni is'forming a new downtown 
club/ Vondcr what it would be like 
to be an alumnus. But then, accord
ing to the article, you dont have to 
-be an alumnus to become a member 
of this club. All you have to do is 
be a night student of Carnegie Tech 
and have the fee ready, and presto 
you can become a member. If I 
wasnt so idle I would like to be
long to this club, and who knows, 
some dayI may.
Wellthat Thanksgiving dancc was 
sure some big affair. Never saw any
thing like it before. Everything 
seemed to be different. The only 
thing they use the stage for now is 
; to keep it empty; you see, they 
placed the orchestra in the middle 
of the hall, but then, it just seemed 
to be the right place for it any
how. The floor was in the best of 
condition, and the crowd, did you 
ever see such a great bunch in your 
life. If the committee continues to 
throw such successful ,affairs, they 
will have us dancing on a balcony 
next. There is an idea, why not put 
one in over in the Union.
Wonder how ."wet weatherI 
should say those graduate .students, 
and research fellows in New Haven 
arc coming along with the prohibition 
question and the grain alcohol? 
Maybe the leak is stoppedand busi
ness in other lines will report, im
provement.
How many noticed that the Book 
store room has changed its opening 
and nosing hours. I didnt and as 
a cons'cqucnce went over a little be
fore niinc p. m. and found the room 
closed! You can imagine my thoughts 
about: this time. I was fooled so 
manytimes coming early that I 
thought the best time would be after 
class or at least just before 9:00 
when I could leave the studio, and 
get back before ' the fellow came 
around with his.littlebookpresent 
absentuyou know. I started an in
vestigation and fou: d out that the 
opening and closing hours were 
moved to from 6:15 to 8:45 p. m. 
Now this is a very good thing be
cause it will give a chance to those 
students wljo have early classes to 
get their supplies, etc. We arc get
ting so many breaks here of late 
that I have come to the conclusion 
that the Night Student Council cer
tainly arc on the job. They seem 
to know how to get things done and 
just at the  right time too. Maybe 
they will be able to drive the "yel
low horses away from the drive.
I guess the next issue of Puppet 
will be coming along soon. The last 
one was surely good. It is a problem 
where they obtained all the informa
tion they did about the various 
ones mentioned. Glad they didnt 
haVe something on me, because if 
they did, then I would begin to 
know that somebody w?s reading 
this column at least. Speaking of 
Puppet anyhow, it is a good humor
ous collcgc publication and we are 
glad we are given the opportunity 
of: supporting it.
The time of the Night Engi
neering banquet is fast approach
ing and the committee in charge of 
the affair has made all plans for a 
very successful gathering. They 
have selected a talented group of 
entertainers which will do justice 
to the occasion, and while-, thcjr 
will not divulge the name of this 
group, they say that }rour surprise 
will be great when you sec them 
performing. You were told last' 
wreek that they were selecting this 
entertainment with great care and 
you are now assured that you will 
not be disappointed.
The Gold Room of the Fort 
Pitt Hotel has been reserved as 
the banquet hall and should prove 
a pleasing setting. The hotel 
management has promised prompt 
service to the guests, and the din
ner, well you "will just have to at
tend and be the judge.
A thorough canvass of all the 
night engineers is being made bjr 
the ticket salesmen and they arc 
working to make this affair a com
plete success. Buy }rour tickcts 
from them as early this week as 
you possibly can so that returns 
can be made and final guarantee 
given the hotel management. Every 
night engineer is expected to turn 
out for the occasion.
 The price of the ticket is $2.50 
per plate, so when the salesman 
secs you this week, show him 
that you appreciate the efforts 
which are being made to entertain 
you and make the neccssary pur
chase. Put aside all your studies 
for one night, and come out and 
enjoy a real good time.

The Night Student Council 
scored another success on Novem
ber 28, whenthey held the Thanks
giving Recess Dancc. Upon en
tering the large auditorium, it w^s 
hard to realize that you were ; in 
the Mens Gymnasiuth. The skilfully.; arranged decorations, trans
ferred the drab walls into a beau
tiful hall. Each time the hall is' 
used a new scheme of decoration 
is used, and this time the commit
tee seemed to cxccl.
As an innovation, the augmented 
orchestra was placed in the cen
ter of the iloor and this was the 
occasion of a great deal of favor
able comment. It gave a pleasing 
setting to the band of musicians. 
En. Bocchicchio and his Venetian 
Serenadcrs certainly entered into 
the spirit of the occasion* and the 
music was - all that could be de
sired in every respect. The danc
ers were incessant .in their calls 
for encores, and the ever obliging 
troup responded in a very gener
ous manner.
 The guests of the evening were 
Mr. and Mrs. Kent D. Shaffer, Mr. 
and Mrs. Samuel E. Dibble, and 
Mr. and Mrs. Glen U. Clccton.
At a designated time the festoons 
of balloons were lowered and crcated: a very unique diversion.
Everybody tried to secure one of 
the coveted balloons and in the rivalry 
for the possession a keen contest 
was staged. Even after you had 
one of them it was not secure, as 
a pinch sufficed to explode the 
round ball.
Refreshments were also provided 
for those present and the tables 
were always crowded by those 
partaking of the punch and cakcs.
Mr. Henry E. Matiro and his so
cial cominittcc arc certainly to be 
congratulated for the successful 
affair which they made available 
to the night students. In their en
deavor to furnish a little social ac
tivities and make it' possible for 
the night students to become ac
quainted with their fellow students 
they were entirely, successful.
Y DEPARTMENT PLANS 
(Continued from Page One) 
decided as yet just1 what form the 
entertainment will take. The num
ber of students who will attend 
,will be the determining factor. Stu
dents who will not go home for 
the holidays arc requested to leave 
their names in the Y office as 
soon as possible so that definite 
plans can be laid.
For the past few years it has 
been the custom for the Y. W. and 
Y. M: C. A.s to provide entertain
ment for students over the holi
days. If there is a large enough 
group, a banquet is usually held; 
if only a small group stays on the 
campus, attempts arc made to dis
tribute the students with families. 
All of this is provided gratis. It 
is one of the many gratis provisions 
for students sponsored by the 
campus organizations throughout 
the year.
About thirty-fivev. men and an 
equal numcr of wiincn attended 
the Thanksgiving dinner held in 
the faculty dining room in the 
Womens Dining Hall on Thanks
giving evening. After the dinner 
moving pictures were shown in the 
dining hall.

DOWNTOWN CLUB TO 
BE OPENED BY 
CARNEGIE TECH
APPRECIATION
The Carnegie Downtown Club, 
which has been announcedon scv: 
era I occasions on the Alumni page 
has become a reality. The head
quarters will be at 421 Fifth ave
nue, Pittsburgh, Pa. This is the 
former quarters of. the Princcton 
Luncheon Club. The club is being 
organized and supported by the 
Carnegie Tech Alumni Associa
tion.
The plan of the club is to fur
nish a downtown meeting place for 
students of Carnegie Institute of 
Technology, trustees and members 
of the faculty. It will afford a 
splendid opportunityof meeting 
former students of this institution 
as well as furnishing the means of 
passing a -few minutes in a com
fortable lounge room.
All night students of Carnegie 
Institute of Technology arc eligi
ble to belong to the club, and a 
large registration from this group 
is looked forward to. Two classcs 
of membership arc available, name
ly, Resident Membership and Non
resident Membership. The dues 
for Resident Membership is $10 per 
year and the dues for Non-resi
dent Membership is $5 per year. 
Non-resident membership is de
signed to take care of those mem
bers who reside 25 miles or more 
from the club;
A blank for membership in the 
club ^lias 1 been published in the 
Carnegie Tartan or one may be 
obtained by applying to the Alumni 
Office, Carnegie Institute of Tech
nology, Schenley Park, Pittsburgh, 
Pa.
At this time it is fitting that a 
little announcement be made about 
those night students who came out 
on Thanksgiving morning to make 
the ncccssarjdecorations for the 
following evening.
To begin with, the sacrificing of 
a much ' needed holiday by those 
students certainly showed that they 
were willing to co-operate with the 
Night /Student Council in helping 
to make the affair a succcss. When 
you add to this the inclemency of 
the weather, for it was about the 
coldest day we have had ibis year, 
they showed more than a willingncss, it was a deep interest in 
the work. They realize that it 
takes more than a promise to work 
to make a go oE anything, they 
actually came out and did their 
share to put the project over.
Just like everything else, when 
something new comes along a lot 
of promises arc made and one is 
led to believe that dependence can 
be placcd upon these promises, but 
I when the test conics, only those 
j with the sterling qualities, and a 
real interest will stand the test. 
The Night Student Council has rc^ 
ccivcd a great number of promises 
of help from the student body in 
all the activities, but the newness 
of the situation has worn off and 
when the test catnc, some were 
found wanting. You hear it said 
that I dont have the time, but I 
want to help. How much good is 
this kind of help when; the work 
is, to be done and done quickly? 
Promises wont do it, it takes more 
than that. Or you may hear that 
thus and so is not necessary, still 
on the other hand the same source 
will be the first to cry if everything 
is not just so. How often is this 
the ease? Criticism is one of the 
easiest things to indulge in, in fact 
it is a slacker's paradise, but the 
critics arc the last to give a help
ing hand.
The Night Student Council ifc 
fortunate to have a group of stu
dent workers who realize the im
portance of giving a helping hand 
instead of a lot of idle words and 
promises, and it is to these stu
dents that your Social Chairman ex
tends his appreciation for the 
whole-hearted work exhibited by 
those, both new and old, who came 
out and helped him make the 
Thanksgiving Dancc the real suc
cess it was.
H. E. Mauro, Social Chairman.
CHANGE OF LOCATION 
OF DOWNTOWN 
CARNEGIE LIBRARY
Recently, the downtown branch 
of the Carnegie Librcy of Pittsburgh 
was removed from the City-County 
Building to new quarters in the 
Union Trust Building. The reason 
assigned for this change was that 
the space was pccdcd in the CityCounty Building. This may be the 
reason, but at all events, it is a 
happy solution, and we arc glad that 
the service is not lost entirely.
The service which is rendered by 
this branch is far reaching bccausc it 
acts as a medium for the central 
unit. It is primarily a business 
reference medium, but other uses 
are made of the station. Books may 
be reserved through the branch, 
books may be returned through the 
branch without having to go to cen
tral, books may be requested from 
Central and the borrower may obtain 
them at the downtown branch. The 
usual high standard of the library 
system applies at tliis branch and any 
help in finding a volume will be 
cheerfully given when requested.
While the service is available to 
the citizens of Pittsburgh the ques
tion may be asked as to how many 
oi.tsidc of Pittsburgh take advantage 
of this, privilege which the taxpayers 
of the city furnish. Arc they paying 
for this service?
This is a large metropolitan district 
and in a recent election the question 
of consolidating the district was de
feated by the all too jealous borough population. However, when the 
question of using the facilities which, 
the city places at the disposal of the 
public is involved these boroughs 
would start to kick when they arc 
denied the use of them. They use 
our parks and all the equipment con
tained therein without any thought
of who pays for it, but when it
comcs to using any of their equip
ment, say for instance a swimming 
pool or the like, only th$ elite of the 
particular borpugh may use it and 
they dont care who knows it. Think 
it over. Pittsburgh deserves to be 
placcd among the leading citics of
our country.

McCurdy Passes Well
The Plaid attack featured two 
passes, an interception, and steady 
drives which totaled 221 yards. The 
first play for Iiarry McCurdy in the 
second quarter was his 25 yard pass 
to George Karel who outran two , 
W. & J. backs for the first touch
down. No more than a half an hour 
later this same combination put over 
the same play with like results. Mc
Curdy remained in the spbtlight 
with his interception of an enemy 
pass, and his 40 yard run for the 
final touchdown. Kavel added a few 
thrills with his frequent breaks 
from the scrimmage line.
John Karcis plunged through in 
his lisual big way, one smash of 
which resulted in a touchdown. But 
it seems that the Presidents gave 
"Dutch Eyth too much personal at
tention,1 and from his actions in the 
game the score would have been a 
good deal greater had the Presidents, 
not watched, him so closely.
Saturdays game closed an event
ful football campaign that was mark
ed by startling upsets and good ball 
playing. A glance at the final score 
card shows that the Plaid team has 
mounted up/275 against 77 o their 
opponents points. The Tartans have 
emerged victorious in three of the 
six major games; With this record, 
Carnegie will enter the 1931 season 
with a standing that is well abreast( 
of the "specialists in the football 
business.

High speed ... swift motion ... the advance of a mechanical age car

a safe defenseTimken Tapered Roller Bearings.
Engineers of former years have left a heritage to the student engi** 
neers of todaya heritage of anti-friction protection for all types 
of mechanical equipment.
Thirty years ago and more, Timken introduced the tapered principle 
of construction, based upon the ever-present twin loadsradial and 
thrust. The intervening period has served to emphasize the correct
ness of Timken design.
Thus Timken tapered construction, Timken positively aligned rolls 
and Timken-made steel are guardians of power... savers of lubri
cant... life preservers for machinery.
In modern construction equipment, in huge steel rolling mills, in 
machine tools, in motor cars, trucks and tractors, in railroad trains, 
in airplanes, in all machineryevery mechanical movement finds a 
Timken Bearing made with utmost precision to fill every modern 
anti-friction need.
Every advance that Industry makes secs the Timken total grow, while 
the cost of power, lubrication and maintenance knocks the bottom out 
of all former levels. The Timken Roller Bearing Co., Canton, Ohio.

The Misunderstood R. O. T. C.
There has been brought to our attention of_ late consider
able literature concerning the" advisability of military training 
in American colleges. There is hardly a mail that does not 
bring at least one letter on the subject. They may advocate 
either side of the question or none at all. They may be ques
tionnaires or collections o unrelated data or the results of 
an investigation upon one definite phase of the question. All, 
however, give the impression of working toward some goal 
which may or may not be revealed.
Pacifists found their theories which are fundamentally 
worthy, if somewhat too idealistic for practicability under pre
sent conditions, on logical arguments. The militarists refute 
each one of their arguments with one equally logical. This de
bate has gone on for years and probably will continue for many 
more. It is not this question which he wish to discuss, but 
rather certain accusations brought against., the more specific 
subject of military training in institutions of higher learning.
One criticism brought frequently to our notice is that such 
trainingwill develop in the participants a belligerent' spirit 
and a warlike nature. Knowledge of the use of weapons can 
hardly produce among sane and intelligent men an uncon
trollable desire to practice, their knowledge. Surely it is a 
direct insult to the character of young Americans' when pacifists 
assume that they are so weakminded that they cannot be trusted 
with munitions or information regarding their use. Students of 
chemistry learn the compounding of lethal gases, yet no one 
considers them a potential threat to the safety of humanity.
 A statement to the effect that the American people are 
normally pacific and non-military and militant only under-pro
vocation or threat appeared some time ago in the editorial 
columns of one of this countrys leading newspapers. We feel 
that this statement is not only true but that it also justifies the 
policy of the - government in maintaining its training corps. 
Qranted that such training did develop this belligerent nature, 
the ultimate application or use ofthe spirit is not controlled by 
those in whom it has been cultivated. The danger of threat of 
armament depends entirelyupon whether it is an active or a 
passive threat.
It is also not wise to overlook the training in specialized 
field that the government offers. The R.O.T.C. does not limit 
itself to a study of firearms and their use. It offers to the 
technician training in his field that is not included in the 
general curriculum, information that is applicable to times other 
than those of national emergency.
*- We repeat that we are not attempting to settle the argu
ments of long standing between pacifists and militarists. The 
point that we have chosen to bring out is only one of several 
major issues. We offer no final solution. We do maintain, 
however, that the safety of the world is in no way endangered 
by any psychological effect that military training is said to have.
Foreign Students To 
Attend Reception 
Saturday
Invitations have been sent to the 
foreign students attending Pitts
burgh colleges to a reception in 
their honor, Saturday evening, Dec
ember 13. The reception will be 
given in Recreational Hall, Mar
garet Morrison Carnegie College, 
at 8 oclock by the Pittsburgh 
Branch of the American Associa
tion of University Women.
The program is in charge of 
Mrs. F. B. Chalfant, who has long 
been interested in the students from 
foreign lands, assisted by Vartanush 
Parounakian, of Constantinople and 
Gertrude Luning of Germany. Miss 
Parounakian is a student at Penn
sylvania College for Women and 
Miss Luning vis doing graduate 
work at the University of Pitts
burgh. Mrs. Samuel Selkovitz of 
Aliquippa will present a group of 
selections for the piano.
Organization Dinner
For De Molays Wed.
There will be a dinner and meet
ing for all Dc Molays and Junior 
Builders, .both active and Alumni, in 
the banquet hall of Carnegie Inn on 
December 10, at 6:30 p. m. The cost 
of the dinner will be $1.
The purpose of this meeting is to 
create a permanent organisationof 
the De Molays on the campus and 
to elect a set ofpermanent officers 
for the year. The organization will 
be primarily for social purposes, and 
there will be no membership dues.
In discussing the meeting, William 
Niebaunt said:
We would like to have as many 
De Molays as possible come to the 
dinner. However, if it-is impossible 
to get there for dinner, be stire to 
coine to the meeting afterwards.
Hellow Folks!
-'Swan songs were popular -last 
Saturday at the final football game 
of the season. Besides marking 
the last game of the football play
ers who will graduate next spring, 
the occasion provided the last ap
pearance of Cheerleaders Pat Ja
cobs and Willie Ryshanck, except 
at basketball games, of Student 
Director Will Worland, of the 
Kiltie \ Band, and of Drum Major 
Frank Mueller, who has twirled the 
baton in v front of. the Kilts for 
four 3;ears, having succccded his 
brother in' that position. It is rcgretable that these men, making 
their final efforts, were not given 
suitable ovations, but the thinlyscattered crowd prevented suah 
demonstration. The students might 
well have risen, however, and 
cheered the senior football players 
us the}- lcit the. field.
The election of Howard Dutch 
Eyth as honorary captain of the 
1930 team at the banquet Satur
day night makes lots of people 
besides Dutch feel good. One 
of the most popular boys on the 
team, Dutch deserved national 
recognition this year if ever any
body did, but fate prevented it 
The players chose wisely.
Another Soph hop rolls around 
Friday night, with the High Hat
ters providing the music, at Web
ster Hall. The socially elite will 
be there, with the Sophomores 
probably in the minority.
Feeling the need of financial re
inforcement, and heeding the suc
cess of previous tea dances, Mor
tar Board tries its hand at after
noon dansants ttDmorrow from 4:30 
to 6:30 oclock. Having the dig
nified backing of the Senior girls, 
and-having also a cut rate (25 
cents) for gentlemen, the dance 
will probably be a success. Jerry 
McGeorge will play the trumpet 
again.
Pittsburgh police would be 
slightly dismayed had the under
graduates in the recent melee been 
as determined as the University of 
Cuba students -who. recently wreck
ed .their administration building. 
When confronted by th^ law,' 
the Cubans killed one officer and 
wounded others in a pistol battle.
The reason for the revolt was 
given as a protest against the de

won two European scholarships at 
the Academy and went abroad to' 
study in Paris and Spain. In 1913 
his painting, Tired Out won honorablmention at the Carnegie Insti
tute International.
In 1924, he had an exhibition of 
his paintingsthe majority of which 
were portraitsat Carnegie Institute. 
Included in the show were the por
traits of a number of Pittsburghers. 
In 1926 Leopold Scyffcrt won the 
Popular Prize in the Twenty-fifth 
Carnegie International, and this year 
lie served as a member of the Amer
ican Committee of Selection for the 
Twenty-ninth International.
The Portrait of Marion Eckhart 
the painting which won the Popular 
Prize, is done with the'' delicate and 
sympathetic surcness which chaMctcrizcs Mr. Scyffcrts portraits. It 
reveals personality and is very pleas
ing in cob r. Miss Eckhart is a daughter 
of Mr. Percy 13'. Eckhart, a very 
prominent banker of Chicago. All 
the members of the Eckhart family 
have been painted by Mr. Seyffe'rt. 
The rich color of the painting and 
the charm of the young woman, 
make the picture an outstanding one 
in the Exhibition.
This is the seventh time that a 
Popular Prize has been awarded in 
connection with the Carnegie Inter
national. In 1924 and 1925 Malcolm 
Parcell won the Popular Prize, in 
1926 Leopold Scyffcrt, in 1927 Gari 
Mclchcrs, in 192S Edumv.nd C. Tarbcll, and last year James Chaplin 
was awarded the prize for his paint
ing entitled, Emmet; George and 
Ella Marvin.
A great deal of interest was 
aroused this year in the Popular 
Prize Contest. Over 5,000 votes were 
,cast. Paintings which received awards 
frc i the jury, polled very few votes.
The ballots were counted by a 
committee of .three,, consisting of 
Joseph J. Cloud, Cyrus Hungerford, 
and Edward Prendcrgast.
The International continued an
other week . in order that  'visitors 
might return to see the  Popular

I was in a moving picture house 
the other night when the heroine 
after going through hell for her 
man announced very sweetly to 
him in a blend of talkie lisp and 
hoarse passion:
"I love you.
Immediately the theater was 
filled with' loud shouts and' pierc-1 
in'g whistles, or, as we used to 
say in physics classesthe birdie.
There was a woman seated be
side me, two in fact. One turhed 
to the other and remarked, It's 
some of them Carnegie Tech 
devils.
"Gosh, theyre awful, ain't they? 
was the prompt and expected re
ply.
But the remarks set me wonder
ing. Just what docs the laity, to 
cull a word from the doctors and 
clergy,, think of these crazy beings 
who go to college?. What do they 
think of us? What can - they?
In the fall, you go chasing 
around looking, for lodging. You 
come to a rooming house. A 
twelve-year-old boy answers the 
door. He yells, Hey, ma, theres 
a student here.
Student, the word immediately 
sets you apart; you're not an or
dinary person. But what docs it 
connote to .the lanlady? Docs it 
mean a man who spends innumer
able hours poring over mysterious 
text books, that she has glanced 
through and puzzled about While 
cleaning?- Docs it mean a creature 
who tacks up all maimer of pen
nants on his walls, and pictures of 
long, silkcit-stockinged girls, some 
so breezily clad that she  dare 
scarcely look at them? k Does it 
mean a man who always >vails that 
he is broke, and then spends two 
weeks rent on a girl in a single 
night? Or, ,who staggers home, 
all too often, drunk?
Orshifting to the perspective 
of the waitress at Child's or Gam
mons. Who arc thesecrazy peo
ple who invade iicr domain at 
two and three in the morning? 
Tuxedo-clad and draped in hundred 
dollar evening gowns, they ooze 
in after a wild night of dancihg 
to munch waffles and Coffee, or to 
eat shredded' wheat, baked apples, 
and cinnamon buns? What brand 
of insanity is it that bids people 
perform appendectomies on tile 
tables, or draw cartoons on per
spiration-drenched starched shirts?
Or the gentleman of the campus 
stores. What does lie think? Of 
people who come into his shop 
every day for a month and pester 
him to buy advertising space in 
a ridiculously inefficient advertis
ing medium? Or boys who would 
rather pay, $8 for a (16 pair of 
shoes than .$5.95? Of gentlemen 
who buy more ties in a month
than a normal man buys in a year, 
and yet most of the time dress 
in a manner so palpably absurd 
that it nauseates the soul of any 
true tailor?
Whats the answer? What do 
sane rational people think when 
they ride past the campus in the 
fall, and sec red-skirted she-devils 
paddling the posteriors of paintdaubed frcshwomcn? What do 
they think of these huge houses 
with the Greek letters on, from 
whence issue the weirdest of shapes 
and shrieks and sights unholy in 
the desolation of the night and 
early morn? What do they think 
when a man who is supposed to 
be the summuin optimum of cul
ture et cetera snaps his l";.:crs 
casually and boasts of the munfter" 
of examination^ lie has failed?
Just try to conjecture some time 
what the laity thinks of us! If 
you do, you'll pray for the souls 
of, them Carnegie Tech devils.

"Whitewash this Disaster?5 
"Never! said the Editor
C-R-A-S-H! The very earth seemed wrenched asunder by a 
giant hand .- . . Then dread silence; an ominous pause; fol
lowed by a terrific inferno of destructive flame and explosion. 
That frightful conflagration at the Denmark, New Jersey, 
government arsenal, took heavy toll of lives. The little town 
nearby was suddenly hurled into a maelstrom of terror, loss 
:; . and federal investigations.
There was little justification for this calamicy; hardly any ex
cuse for the lack of protection to lives and property. But, Gov
ernment investigations whitewashed all concerneduntil. 
The editor of Chcm and Met investigated the smoldering 
ruins. His report was not of the "whitewashing type. It. 
boldly set forth the factsdisclosed the lack of protective 
measuresplaced the blame directly where it belonged. And, 
all through the bitter controversy which followed, this editor 
held his grounddidnt retract one word of the truth.
The consequence? From that time forth, the Government has 
faithfully embodied, in all arsenals constructed, those rec
ommendations for safety and protection which were stressed 
in this McGraw-Hill journal.
McGraw-Hill editors, first of all, must dig out the truth :;; 
then through every opposition, stick to their guns. This is 
one big reason why so many of the nations leaders turn to 
tl\ese journals for news on industrys doings. This, too, is 
one big reason why you should read the McGraw-Hill paper 
that covers the field you expect to enter.
Leading college libraries have McGraw-Hill Publications. 
Ask your librarian.
