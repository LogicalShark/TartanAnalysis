University opens Baker Hall wing addition
by Aseem GuptaWebmaster
The beginning of the new 
school year has brought with it 
the completion and opening of the 
new high-tech wing of Baker Hall. 
At first glance, many may not 
notice the new wing, which looks 
remarkably similar to the rest of 
Baker, but upon entering the 
wing, the difference is obvious. 
Were very happy with the con
struction to date, said Susan M. 
Kinchelow, assistant dean of 
H&SS.
Kinchelow noted that one of the 
noteable aspects of the new wing 
is that it blends well with the 
existing Baker structure. One of 
the challenges was keeping the 
footprint similar, she said. 
Were happy with the way weve 
tied the appearance in with that of 
the old building. While the new 
structures size appears to be in 
tandem with the rest of Baker 
Hall, the basement, which houses 
a new high-tech auditorium 
amongst other things, is actually 
bigger than other comparable sec
tions of Baker.
We feel [the wing] is a big 
thing for H&SS, but also a big part 
of the [University], said Andrea 
C. Lehman, director of develop
ment for H&SS. Lehman and 
Teresa Sokol Thomas, the public 
relations director for Arts & 
Science, are hoping that students 
throughout the University will uti
lize the new space, including the 
wings patio.

attended by students from other

Construction on Baker Hall has finally reached an end. The entryway is to be 
completed on Monday and the classrooms and offices are already open to 
students and faculty.
Housing attempts to fill firstyear student room demand
by Sara StilleNews Editor
This year, as well as the past sev
eral years, many first-year stu
dents have been placed in tempo
rary housing off-campus while 
1 they wait for a" space to open up 
for them on campus'. Due to record 
numbers of first-year students and 
a high room retention rate from 
upperclassmen, 61 students were 
placed in temporary housing this 
year.
Many new students found 
themselves in the Wyndham Hotel 
on Forbes Avenue or in Shadyside 
Inn on Fifth Avenue. According to 
Tim Michael, the director of 
Housing, all of the students in the 
Wyndham Hotel have been placed 
in permanent housing, but 31 stu
dents still remain in the Shadyside 
1 Inn. We have never had anyone 
1 in temp housing beyond 
September 30. I expect to meet 
that deadline again this year, said 
. Michael.
Michael said the lack of on-campus housing is mainly because this 
years first-year class is larger than 
Housings initial planning by at 
least 10 students. Another reason 
 is . that around 25 fewer upper
classmen cancelled their housing 
contracts than Housing projected.
Adria Greene, the housing 
assignments coordinator, has 
been the point person for placing
students in permanent on-campus 
housing. Greene, as well as the 
rest of Housing, has taken many 
steps to find space for these stu
dents on campus. After opening 
we identified all the vacancies and 
verified that the assigned resi
dents were not coming to CMU 
this year. Also, we are still allow
ing students to cancel their hous
ing license agreements and move 
off campus, said Michael. Once 
we get the space we need, we will 
stop releasing residents. Students 
also start leaving for academic 
and medical reasons, creating 
space. In an attempt to encourage 
returning students to move offcampus, making room for firstyears, Housing is refunding 
upperclassmen who cancel their 
housing arrangments $400, which 
is double the original housing 
reservation fee.
While students in the Shadyside 
Inn complained about the long 
walk to campus and lack of ethernet, they seemed to enjoy the airconditioning and privacy of their 
own bedrooms. I think this is way 
better than a dorm. I could stay 
here the whole year, said Adam 
Ferral, a first-year computer sci
ence major. Ferral said besides the 
20 minute walk to campus and the 
24-hour quiet rule, the apart
ments were great. He liked having 
a kitchen and air-conditioning.
Personally, I would prefer a 
dorm, said Aaron Rising, a firstyear biology major. I like the 
atmosphere of a dorm. The apart
ments are nice, but far away and 
we dont have an ethernet connec
tion here.
Andy Herrman and Ben Ahroni, 
both first-year computer science 
majors, also complained about not 
having ethernet. Its hard 
because all of our professors are 
expecting us to do things online, 
but we often have difficulty get
ting a dial-up connection. Its busy 
a lot, said Herrman.
The students didnt seem to feel 
left out or isolated from the orien
tation activities or campus life, 
though. The temporary housing 
locations are staffed with -residen
tial advisors and orientation coun
selors just like on-campus hous
ing. The students have been 
involved in several social events 
such as a barbecue held on Labor 
Day. Students also have communi
ty social space this year in addi
tion to their own rooms. We kind 
of have our own Shadyside Inn 
clique, said Ferral. We also had 
really good orientation counselors 
and a good RA.
While the temporary housing 
may be far away, several modes of 
transportation are available to the 
students. People in the Wyndham 
Hotel were provided with a shuttle 
service that ran continuously from 
7am to lam each day. Students in 
the Shadyside Inn are on the CMU

colleges, so we hope that most stu
dents feel like they can use the 
resources that the new wing pro
vides, said Thomas. People 
should even feel like they can 
walk through the Baker Deans 
office.
While the finishing touches of 
the new wing are not yet com
plete, administrators say that con
struction is proceeding on sched
ule, and key components such as 
the entrance to Baker should be 
open by Monday, September 11. 
There will be no steps at the front 
entrance, said Kinchelow. 
Kinchelow said that the University 
is trying to keep the new entrance 
similar to the original entrance by 
preserving the pattern design of 
inlaid bricks that was there prior 
to the construction.
The four floor addition houses 
lecture halls, faculty offices, psy
chology labs, the Academic 
Advising Center, and the Deans 
office for the college. The third 
and fourth floors of the new wing 
are primarily office spaces for the 
psychology department, which 
according to Kinchelow, was in 
need of increased space to acco
modate their rapidly expanding 
program. On the first floor of the 
wing is the Deans office, a college 
conference room, and the 
Schoenwald lounge, which 
Kinchelow admitted still needs 
work. The basement houses a cof
fee bar, a student lounge, and the 
150-seat Giant Eagle Auditorium.
Kinchelow said that she was 
aware of the jokes about the Giant 
Eagle-sponsored space. People

Heinz 
offers new 
program
by Cam CrewsStaff Writer
The Heinz School and the 
School of Computer Science col
laborated  to provide a new 
University-wide graduate level 
program in Information 
Technology this semester. The 
Masters of Science in 
Information Technology (MSIT) 
program joins the Masters of 
Information Systems
Management (MISM) as the sec
ond program offered in conjunc
tion by the two schools.
The MSIT program offers four 
tracks aimed at mid-career pro
fessionals with at least three 
years of business experience. 
Currently, all tracks are restrict
ed to part time enrollment. The 
Information Security and 
Assurance (ISA) and Software 
Design and Management (SDM) 
tracks will both be offering full 
time enrollment options in May 
2001. Applicants may utilize cor
porate partnerships to fund their 
expenses.
The SDM track is the most 
technical program within the 
MSIT program and focuses upon 
software development and man
agement. Many of the courses 
within the SDM originate from 
the School of Computer Science 
(SCS). The ISA track involves 
data protection and is geared 
towards professionals with a 
need to gain heightened aware
ness of security issues. Courses 
within the track include data 
architecture and information 
security issues.
The Information Technology 
Management (ITM) track offers 
skills in the information technol
ogy and the management issues 
associated with the field. Core 
courses include programming, 
analysis, design, electronic com
merce, and database and 
telecommunications manage
ment. Of the four tracks, ITM is 
most comparable to the Masters 
of Information Systems 
Management program. The 
Software Engineering track 
offers courses specifically tai
lored towards software develop
ment issues, and all courses are 
based out of the School of

New associate provost 
position created, filled
by Jennifer ResickStaff Writer
Susan Ambrose was named the 
Associate provost of Educational 
Development last summer. She 
began her role in this new position, 
created by Paul Christiano, the for
mer provost, on July 1, 2000. The 
position is an addition to Ambroses 
current responsibilities as the 
Director of the EberlyCenter for 
Teaching Excellence.
Last year, the American Council 
on Education awarded Ambrose' 
one of thirty fellowships, giving her 
the opportunity to shadow the 
president of another university. 
Ambrose spent the 1999-2000 aca
demic year at Connecticut College 
and the University of Rhode Island 
to obtain another perspective on 
higher learning institutions. This 
program is typically aimed at indi
viduals whose goal is to become a 
college president. This, however, 
was not my goal and still is not my 
goal, said Ambrose. I feel the 
University is really interested in me 
and [this_new position] is a great 
way for me to give back to the insti
tution.
With Ambroses return, 
Christiano decided to take the next 
step in directing her efforts toward 
the advancement of education here 
at CMU. Ambrose will work very
closely with Indira Nair, the Vice 
Provost of Education, and will 
devote time to expanding cross-dis
ciplinary . education. About a 
dozen courses were funded last 
year, and we are currently working 
with these to decide if we have 
money for new projects, said 
Ambrose. As part of her new 
responsibilities, Ambrose will coor
dinate fundraising for educational 
projects. My role is to ask the fun
damental questions on what a CMU 
student is and what [he or she] 
should leave here with, said 
Ambrose. She still, however, finds 
time to teach in the History depart
ment. I can only teach one course 
per semester now, but I still want to 
because I love it, said Ambrose. 
Currently Ambrose is catching up 
on everything she missed last year 
and working to develop her new 
role.
Ambrose received her D.A. from 
the department of History and 
joined the Eberly Center in 1986 as 
its associate director. She was 
appointed to the role of director in 
1991 and has served in that posi
tion ever since. The center serves 
as a guide for faculty, teaching 
assistants, and anyone teaching a 
course at the school. Ambrose 
helps faculty teach, revise, and cre
ate courses with the aim of the 
overall improvement of teaching at 
the University.

U. Arkansas police officers shrug 
off hero label after quick response
(U-WIRE) FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. - 
!We dont feel like heroes, we were 
just doing our job, University of 
Arkansas Police Department offi
cers Matt Mills and Aaron Mahon 
;said.
UAPD Captain Brad Bruns said 
these officers arrived within one 
minute of a 911 call informing 
UAPD that gunshots had been 
heard from Room 231 in Kimpel 
Hall.
The office is where graduate stu
dent James E. Kelly, 37, apparently 
murdered professor John R. Locke, 
67, in Lockes office, August 28, 
before turning the gun on himself, 
according to a medical examiners 
report.
Bruns said the police officers 
quick response to contain the dan
gerous situation probably saved 
other lives.
Mills and Mahon were on bike 
patrol that day, Bruns said.
Mahon was in the 
Administration Building, and his 
bike outside, when he received the 
dispatch at 12:14 pm; Mills was in 
the Arkansas Union, and his bike 
was locked outside.
Both arrived on the second floor 
of Kimpel by 12:15 pm.
When I received the call, 
Mahon said, I tried to get there as 
soon as I could. I didnt know for 
certain if they were gunshots, it 
could have been balloons popping 
or a cap pistol. I expected the 
worst and hoped for the best.
Mills said when they arrived, the 
people directed them to the office 
where someone told them three 
shots had been heard, and they 
immediately cleared the area.
My mind was racing, I didnt 
know who was in the room, or how 
many. I didnt know if it was a sui
cide attempt or a hostage situa
tion, Mahon said.
Mills said he and Mahon were in
the hallway at the entrance to the 
office and officers Carla Holcomb 
and Mark Nichols were outside on 
the south side of the building 
watching the balcony of Lockes 
office.
We were comfortable that we 
had the situation contained, Mills 
said.
Mahon said he had a lot of grati
tude for the other officers who 
responded. Not only for UAPD offi
cers, but also the Fayetteville 
Police and Fire Departments, who 
helped evacuate the building, he 
said.
It was a comforting feeling 
knowing the cavalry was coming, 
he said.
Mills said Mahon established 
verbal contact with someone in 
the office.
Are you hurt? Come out, we 
wont hurt you, Mahon said, in 
front of the locked door.
Yes, Im hurt. Dont come in, 
Mahon said Kelly replied, 
although at the time Mahon didnt 
know it was Kelly.
Mahon later confirmed the voice 
was Kellys after listening to his 
answering machine message.
Bruns said he arrived about five 
minutes after the officers and also 
tried to establish verbal contact 
with the shooter.
Although he could hear some
one moving in the office, he 
received no response.-
After about 15 minutes, Bruns 
said, he heard a fourth shot.
I felt he was probably shooting 
at us. I looked to see if there was a 
hole in door, Bruns said.
I didnt see anybody scared or 
frightened, no heroes taking over, 
just people doing their jobs  
what they were trained for, Bruns 
said.
I looked over my shoulder and 
saw Matt Mills, gun drawn, and I
looked down the hall and saw 
Aaron with his gun drawn, Bruns 
said. I had all the trust in them.
There will always be something 
special in my heart for Matt and 
Aaron. Not because no one else 
would do it, but because they were 
the ones who did. They protected 
me, and I knew they would, he 
said.
Matt and Aaron are real deal 
heroes, Bruns said.
I bet Ive heard that gun go off 
5000 times since [that] Monday, 
Bruns said.
After about 45 minutes, the 
Emergency Response Team with 
the Fayetteville Police Department 
arrived, entered the locked office 
with a key and found Locke and 
Kelly dead on the floor.
Mahon said he felt depressed at 
that time.
(I was) more depressed that 
there were two and not just some
thing self-inflicted, Mahon said.
Mills said he felt confused. Why 
did this happen? he said.
You always second guess your
self in our line of work, Mills said. 
It is the nature of the beast. We 
feel we did all could have done. If 
we had rushed in, we could have 
given the suspect an avenue of 
escape, putting other lives in dan
ger and our own.
We did this by the book, 
Mahon said. This was a perma
nent solution to a temporary prob
lem.
Mahon said that, in spite of the 
tragedy, the response from the 
public has been so great. Students, 
faculty and staff have been coming 
up to us and giving us hugs.
Its good to see us accepted into 
the university community, Mahon 
said.
We appreciate the thanks, but 
we were just doing our jobs, Mills 
said.
Nader favors legalizing marijuana
. SANTA FE, N.M. (AP)  Green 
Party presidential candidate Ralph 
Nader on Friday advocated the 
legalization of marijuana as part of 
an. overhaul of the nations selfdefeating and antiquated drug 
laws.
Nader joined with New Mexico 
Governor Gary Johnson, a 
Republican, in criticizing the 
nations war on drugs as a failed 
policy for fighting drug use.
Addiction should never be
treated as a crime. It has to be 
treated as a health problem, 
Nader said at a news conference 
where he was flanked by the GOP 
governor.
We do not send alcoholics to 
jail in this country. We do not send 
nicotine users to jail in this coun
try. Over 500,000 people are in 
our jails who are non-violent drug 
users.
Nader  like Johnson  sup
ports lifting criminal sanctions for
marijuana possession. For other 
drugs, such as heroin, he advocat
ed harm reduction programs, 
such as methadone maintenance 
and needle exchanges, that focus 
on treatment of addiction and pre
vention of health problems from 
drug use.
Democrat Al Gore and 
Republican George W. Bush 
oppose legalizing marijuana, 
according to their campaign 
spokesmen.

Clinton 
presses for 
wildfire aid
WASHINGTON (AP)  President 
Clinton proposed spending about 
$1.6 billion to help communities 
recover from the forest fires that 
have scorched the West this sum
mer and to thin millions of acres of 
federal forests in hopes of prevent
ing future blazes.
A report submitted Saturday to 
Clinton by two Cabinet secretaries 
said the increased removal of trees 
and brush is needed to reverse 
almost a centurys worth of fire
fighting policy that left forests with 
acres of undergrowth and ready-toburn timber.
For almost 100 years, our nation 
pursued a policy focusing on extin
guishing all wildfires, Clinton said 
in his weekly radio address, broad
cast from New York, where he 
attended the U.N. Millennium 
Summit.
It was well-intentioned, but as a 
result, many of our forests now 
have an unnatural buildup of brush 
and shrubs. This excessive under
growth fuels forest fires, making 
them far more dangerous and diffi
cult to control.
Clinton also announced the
release of nearly $40 million for 90 
restoration projects across the 
West, where fires have charred 6.5 
million acres and 38 large fires con
tinue to burn across nine states.
Clintons proposal led environ
mentalists to worry that stepped-up 
thinning could reopen federal land 
to large-scale commercial logging.
Also, congressional Republicans 
said they would have to weigh 
Clintons request against other 
spending priorities.
The GOP is committed to look
ing at all options, said 
Representative J.C. Watts of 
Oklahoma, the Houses fourthranking Republican.
Idaho Republican Larry Craig, 
chairman of the Senate 
Agricultures forestry subcommit
tee, said the report contains some 
important initiatives that suggest 
the Clinton administration officials 
have at last recognized that our 
nations publicly owned forests are 
not healthy and that this forest 
health problem is contributing to 
our current wildfires.
Unlicensed 
boy uses Web 
to buy car
PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. (AP)  
A 15-year-old unlicensed driver
who crashed through a fence and 
ran over a stop sign may have 
bought the car by tapping a state 
account through the Internet, 
police say.
Terrance Lloyd bought the 
$15,000 Plymouth Neon last month 
from a Chrysler dealer, negotiating 
the deal through email and tele
phone calls, the Sarasota HeraldTribune reported Saturday.
Court records show the boy paid 
for the car using CheckFree, a ser
vice that allows customers to send 
checks electronically. The account 
the check was drawn on belongs to 
the State of Florida Disbursement 
Unit, which issues child support 
payments.
CheckFree told authorities the 
boy sent out an additional 
$105,000 in checks to-other retail
ers, but only the auto dealer deliv
ered merchandise, court records 
show.
Lloyd, who is too young to get a 
license, ran over the fence and sign 
last month, the day after the car 
was delivered. He was cited for dri
ving without a license. He not been 
charged with any crimes in connec
tion with the car purchase but is 
being investigated for grand theft 
and fraud, the Herald-Tribune 
reported.
The boys mother denies that her 
son illegally bought the car.World News
Hong Kong 
chooses new 
legislature
HONG KONG (AP)  
Discontentment with Hong Kongs 
political leader  and the lack of 
full democracy  emerged Sunday 
as citizens and special interests 
voted for a legislature that critics 
say will be unduly controlled by 
pro-Beijing forces and big business.
Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa 
wasnt even on the ballot, but he 
came under harsh attack from vot
ers who accuse him of bungling the 
governance of Hong Kong in the 
three years since it returned from 
British to Chinese sovereignty.
The social undercurrent is very 
bad, said Jimmy Leung, a 62-yearold retired restauranteur who voted 
in Kowloon. Leung accused many 
influential people in Hong Kong of 
going against their consciences to 
curry favor with mainland China.
Theyve become pro-Beijing 
imperialists, Leung said.
Opposition figures will use what
ever minority of seats they gain in 
the Legislative Council, known as 
Legco, to clamor for more democra
cy and to intensify their attacks on 
Tung and a government system that 
now gives some voters much more 
power than others.
Its certainly undemocratic and 
unfair, said Martin Lee, the head of
the opposition Democratic Party. 
Hong Kong people need a stronger 
voice.
Analysts say a recent scandal 
involving charges that an academic 
was pressured to stop polling Tuns 
plunging popularity has only 
served to aggravate dissatisfaction 
among ordinary voters  who only 
have a say on 24 of the 60 legisla
tive seats.
Tung declined to take questions 
when he went out under clear skies 
to vote in a Hong Kong park, where 
a small group of protesters led by 
longshot candidate Leung Kwokhung were chanting Down with 
Tung.
One Leung supporter, Lui Yuk-lin, 
sat on the steps of the polling place 
and began screaming anti-lbng slo
gans, setting off a minor scuffle as 
police moved her back.
I want to make it known to Hong 
Kong, China and the rest of the 
world this is not a democratic elec-' 
tion, and were appealing for Tung 
to step down, Leung said.
Atlantis 
docks with 
space station
SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) 
 Flying without one of its naviga
tional eyes, the space shuttle 
Adantis sped alongside and latched 
onto the growing international
space station early Sunday.
Commander Terrence Wilcutt 
and co-pilot Scott Altman sidled 
Adantis up to the station for the 
linkup, which occurred some 230 
miles above Kazakstan. The duo 
accomplished the docking with 
only one of two star trackers work
ing, a handicap which required a 
few extra roll maneuvers.
Even with the flight complexities 
created by the failed star tracker, 
which broke down Friday, Wilcutt 
and Altman were able to save fuel 
toward an extra day in orbit. 
Shuttle managers want to stretch 
the mission from 11 days to 12, a 
luxury that can only be afforded by 
saving power and fuel.
Shortly after the docking, Wilcutt 
popped the space stations outer 
hatch to capture an air sample. 
NASA scientists were to analyze it 
back on Earth, but an adapter 
Wilcutt was to use to grab the sam
ple malfunctioned and station man
agers chose to forgo the task, con
sidered non-critical.
Ground controllers had already 
fired up the heaters inside the U.S. 
segment of the station in advance 
of Wilcutts brief foray, and flipped 
on scrubbers to clean the air inside 
before Adantis crew of five astro
nauts and two cosmonauts heads 
back inside late Monday.
Before then, astronaut Edward 
Lu and cosmonaut Yuri 
Malenchenko have several exterior 
tasks to complete during a 6 1/2 
hour spacewalk.

News Briefs
CMU receives high ranking in U.S. News and World Report
Carnegie Mellons undergradu
ate programs tied for 23rd with 
Georgetown University for the 
second consecutive year in U.S. 
News & World Report's annual 
survey of Americas Best 
Colleges. The Universitys busi
ness and engineering programs 
retained their top 10 rating.
Princeton was rated the num
ber one university. Harvard and 
Yale tied for second and the 
California Institute of
Technology and the
Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology (MIT) followed.
Carnegie Mellon ranked fifth 
in business, tying with the 
University of North Carolina and 
the University of Texas. The pro
gram is up from its eighth-place 
ranking in 1999. The University 
of Pennsylvania has the top-rated 
business program, followed by 
MIT, the University of Michigan, 
and the University of California 
at Berkeley.
Bush holds downtown rally
Governor George W. Bush visit
ed Pittsburgh last Thursday. He 
held a rally for more than 1,500 
people on the corner of Mellon 
Square to discuss Social Security, 
national defense, and health 
care.
We better have a president 
who thinks differently about the 
Social Security system. If were 
going to have a Social Security 
system tomorrow, we need to 
trust the younger workers of this 
country to manage their own 
money in the private markets, 
said Bush.
Bush has proposed to change 
the retirement system to allow 
younger workers to invest a por
tion of their Social Security con
tribution privately. He argues 
that without such a reform, the 
system will run out of money in 
the next few decades. Vice 
President Al Gore opposes Bushs 
plan, calling it a threat to the pro
grams solvency.
Retired Generals Colin Powell 
and Norman Schwarzkopf, two 
Gulf War colleagues of former 
President George Bush, appeared 
with the younger Bush at a rally 
earlier that day in Dayton.
In Ohio, Colin Powell and 
Norman Schwarzkopf stood by 
my side and said, George Bush 
needs to be the next commanderin-chief,  Bush said. I will 
rebuild the military power of the 
United States of America.
Governor Ridge introduced 
Bush at the rally. He was joined
on the platform by County 
Executive Jim Roddey and 
Representative Katie True, the 
Republican nominee for auditor 
general in the race against incum
bent Democrat Bob Casey, Jr.
Bush alluded to Roddeys upset 
victory last year in his opening 
remarks.
He goes to show something, 
Bush said of Roddey. He goes to 
show that the right kind of 
Republican can carry a 
Democratic county. Thats exactly 
what's going to happen come 
November 2000. You watch what 
happens in November 2000. 
At the time of his speech, Bush 
was shown to be in a dead heat 
with Vice President Al Gore in two 
new national polls. Gore led 44 to 
47 percent among likely voters in 
a CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll. 
The candidates were tied at 47 
percent in an ABC-Washington 
Post poll of likely voters.
At the appearance in Dayton, 
Powell criticized an administra
tion in which he had once served 
as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff for what he called lapses in 
readiness and personnel policies.
Schwarzkopf echoed the criti
cism. Weve done a pretty lousy 
job of predicting who our next 
enemy is going to be in the past 
century, he said. We have some
body who is going to step up and 
who has clearly recognized the 
problem.
If George W. Bush wants to 
talk about the downsizing of our 
military. He should talk to [vice 
presidential nominee] Dick 
Cheney about it, said Dan Fee, 
spokesman for the Democratic 
coordinated campaign in 
Pennsylvania. It was Cheney, as 
our defense secretary, who made 
the cuts he is complaining about. 
The first major cut in spending 
since the Cold War came during 
Cheneys tenure at the Pentagon. 
Cheney says, however, that reduc
tions in military capability have 
now gone too far during the 
Clinton administration.
Bush also appeared this morn
ing at Marconi Corporation, the 
former Fore Systems, in 
Warrendale.

have been asking if theyll need their 
Advantage Card to get in, she said. The 
Giant Eagle stores are owned by the fami
ly of David Shapiro, who is also a trustee 
of the University. [The] family supports 
humanities,, said Lehman. This is a gift 
that President Cohon asked for from the 
Giant Eagle Foundation. This is a local 
Pittsburgh company in support of the 
I community. Lehman remarked that if it 
had been USX or Alcoa donating the 
$400,000 nobody would have questioned 
the name. The college is continuing to 
look for support for other spaces of the 
new wing, and has asked alumni to con
tribute $1,000 for their name to be on a 
plaque in the wing.
The college also has plans for events to 
help acquaint the campus community and 
I alumni with the new addition. At 
Homecoming, the very popular Margaret 
Morrison Tea will be hosted here. There 
will also be programming for H&SS alum
ni, said Thomas. The college is also plan
ning a small opening event on October 
25, 2000 for the University community.
Steve Pajewski is going to do a lec
ture on the history of Baker Hall, 
said Lehman. The College of H&SS 
also plans to debut the new wing 
addition on CMUs Web site, along 
with a photo spread in the Carnegie 
Mellon News.

Candidates negotiate debate
AUSTIN, Texas (AP)  Advisors 
to George W. Bush and Al Gore are 
ready to meet next week for the 
first time to negotiate details of a 
fall series of televised debates 
between the presidential rivals.
Bush late Friday dropped his 
insistence that the first encounter 
be held on Tuesday on a special 60- 
minute evening edition of NBCs 
Meet the Press.
He told his campaign chair to 
contact the Commission on 
Presidential Debates to tell it they 
were ready to talk.
That broke an impasse in the 
debate on the debates between 
the two camps and all but assured 
there would be at least two com
mission-sponsored confrontations.
It came as Republican Bush, try
ing to stem a Gore advance in the 
polls, worked to put his campaign 
back on track.
Governor Bush wants there to 
be debates, and believes the 
American people are best served by 
having debates, said Bushs com
munications director, Karen 
Hughes.
We are pleased that the Bush 
campaign has agreed to meet with 
the bipartisan Commission on 
Presidential Debates. We look for
ward to that meeting, William 
Daley, Gores campaign chairman, 
said late Friday.
Janet Brown, executive director 
of the commission, said that the 
Bush campaign had accepted its 
invitation to meet. We are working 
to schedule a meeting with the 
Bush and Gore campaigns repre
sentatives next week, she said.
The commission, which has over
seen all presidential debates since 
1988, recommended a series of
three 90-minute prime-time ses
sions, all in October.
Bush had agreed to only one of 
those debates, but said he was will
ing to do two other 60-minute 
encounters on individual network 
interview shows  next week on 
Meet the Press and later on CNNs 
Larry King Live.
The Gore campaign balked, say
ing they would only go on those 
shows if Bush agreed to the full set 
of commission debates.
Because Gore had previously said 
he would debate Bush anytime, 
anywhere, Bush attempted to por
tray the Democratic vice president, 
an experienced debater, as seeking 
to duck the debates.
However, some top Republicans 
saw that the strategy was backfir
ing, making Bush look reluctant.
Pennsylvania Governor Tom 
Ridge, who campaigned with Bush 
on Friday in Pittsburgh, told 
reporters Bush has made his 
point in tweaking Gore on the 
debate, but that it now was time to 
move on.
Bush has been anxious to get the 
talk about debate negotiations off 
center stage. Republicans con
cerned about Gores surge in the 
polls have complained the topic is a 
distraction for the campaign and 
for voters Bush is trying to reach.
One possibility being discussed 
at Bushs campaign headquarters 
was accepting two commissionsponsored debates while trying to 
secure a less formal, non-commis
sion session to start off the series.
However, Hughes said the 
prospect of a debate next week was 
no longer likely, nor did she believe 
there could be one before the midSeptember start of the Olympics.
The new Baker Hall wing is now almost completed. There are a few finishing touches to be done, such as the 
entryway, but construction is currently on schedule.

THE TARTAN  SEPTEMBER 11, 20007
Indiana Univer. Fires Coach Bob Knight
INDIANAPOLIS (AP)  Bob 
Knights temper finally did him in. 
The basketball coach, already in 
trouble for a history of misconduct, 
was fired by Indiana for grabbing a 
student by the arm last week to lec
ture him about manners and violat
ing the schools zero-tolerance 
conduct policy.
The decision, announced by uni
versity president Myles Brand at a 
news conference Sunday, ends 
three decades where Knight was 
one of the games best coaches, but 
also one of its most volatile.
Brand, who criticized Knight for 
repeatedly flouting the conduct poli
cy, said he gave the coach the option 
of resigning. When Knight refused, 
he was fired for a continued pattern 
of unacceptable behavior.
Brand said that Knights con
frontation with freshman Kent 
Harvey was not the only reason for 
the Knights dismissal.
The president said he stood by 
his decision for not firing Knight in 
May and starting the conduct poli
cy, calling it the ethical and moral 
thing to do because of Knights 
contributions to the school. I still 
believe we had to give him one last 
chance, Brand said. He failed to 
live up to that.
The search for a new coach will 
begin immediately. Brand said he 
did not yet have any candidates. 
Knight will be paid for the final two 
years of his contract.
Knight won three NCAA champi
onships with the Hoosiers and 
guided the U.S. Olympic team to a
gold medal in 1984.
But his behavior, which has 
included verbal and physical abuse 
of players, has been a problem 
since he took over in 1971.
Knight has one of the games 
most notorious tempers  throw
ing chairs across the court, stuffing 
a fan in -a garbage can, scuffling 
with Puerto Rico police and kicking 
his own son on the bench.
Last spring, he was accused of 
choking one of his players during 
practice in 1997, an act caught on 
videotape. Following a school 
investigation into that claim and 
others, Indiana warned Knight in 
May that he must adhere to the 
zero-tolerance policy, which 
included no inappropriate physi
cal contact with students.
Crime and Incident Report
8/29/00 THEFT  A vice president of the 
University notified campus police that a student had 
been advertising the sale of undergraduate catalogs 
for 2000-2002 for $5. The complainant stated these 
catalogs had been removed from the UC unlawfully 
and requested an investigation. The officer contacted 
the student, who responded to a request for an inter
view with the CMU police officer. The student stated 
on the evening of 8/28/00 he had noticed there were 
several boxes of catalogs inside the UC which appeared 
they were about to be thrown out. He took the boxes 
back to his residence and sent out email stating he had 
the catalogs and was selling them for $5 apiece. When 
advised that the activity was considered a theft, the 
student returned the catalogs immediately.
8/30/00-9/7/00 MULTIPLE THEFTS  At least 
ten bicycle thefts occurred during this period. The 
bicycles were secured in various ways with U-locks or 
cable-locks. In one incident, the responding officer 
found evidence that some sort of grip tool wasused to 
hold the U-lock while blunt force was administered by 
another tool, possibly a hammer and chisel.
9/1/00 CRIMINAL MISCHIEF  A student 
reported that sometime between the night of 8/31/00 
and the afternoon of 9/1/00, person(s) unknown 
walked on his car, causing a dent in the middle of the 
hood. The car was parked in the Morewood lot.
9/1/00 MEDICAL  A student called EMS after 
his alarm clock went off, causing him to roll out of bed 
and fall onto a chair, landing on his left side. The 
responding officer transported the student to 
Presbyterian Hospital to have his sore ribs x-rayed.
9/3/00 MEDICAL  A student was skateboarding 
'down the ramp from Scobell Hall down to Margaret
Morrison Street. He saw pedestrians walking up the 
ramp, panicked, and wiped out, sliding partway down 
the concrete ramp on his side. One of the pedestrians 
helped him to his apartment so police could be called. 
The victim told the officer than he had just started 
skateboarding a week ago; he saw his RA go down the 
same ramp and thought it looked so easy, he figured he 
could do it. His injuries were treated by EMS and he 
was transported to Allegheny General Hospital by 
police.
9/5/00 THEFTA man came into Police Dispatch 
to report a stolen ice machine. The man stated that the 
five-foot-tall, 250-pound ice machine had been left in 
the Physical Plant second floor machine shop for 
repair. After being repaired on June 10, 2000, the 
machine was left in the Physical Plant shop for some 
time. The theft was not reported at the time of discov
ery pending an all-out search of the building for the ice 
machine.
9/7/00 FALSE FIRE ALARM  Two officers and 
a security guard responded to a fire alarm in 
Hamerschlag House. Searching the area, they did not 
discover any smoke or fire but did notice the walls of 
the hall were wet with something which appeared to 
be water. An EMS electrician informed them that the 
wet detector activated the alarm. After silencing the 
alarm and resetting the system, an officer returned to 
the hall to investigate why the walls were wet. A resi
dent stated that he was shooting a water gun at his 
friends and did not intend to cause the fire alarm to be 
activated. In the residents room, the office found four 
water pistols and a Super Soaker in plain view. The 
officer gave the resident a verbal warning.

Housing works to remove first-year 
students from temporary housing
HOUSING, from page 1 
shuttle route.
Michael said that students 
were offered storage space on 
campus for anything they didnt 
want to take into temporary 
housing with them. And when it 
is tim.. for them to move to cam
pus, Housing will make appoint
ments for the moves and provide 
a driver and truck for moving 
assistance.
Housing is now working to 
ensure that fewer students will 
have to be placed in temporary 
housing in the future. We have 
begun meeting again about 
building more student housing 
on the site of the current Cyert 
Center playground between 
Mudge and Morewood Gardens 
on Morewood Avenue, said 
Michael. If that project moves 
forward the earliest the new 
buildings would open is May 
2003.
Michael has also formed a new 
task force, including members 
from the Housing and Student 
Life staff and several students, to 
look at several issues surround
ing first-year housing. The com
mittee will meet for the first time 
on September 18, 2000.
Despite being far away from campus and isolated from much of the first-year 
class, many of the students temporarilyliving in the Shadyside Inn have par
ticipated in several social events and mangaged to form their own "Shadyside 
Inn clique. Housing Services is currently working to find.the 31 students 
still in the Shadside Inn a permanent room by the end of September.

tial changes showed signs of trying to offer 
unique new services. However, with the new 
names of Marketplace and Pepperazzi, came 
even more generic and poorly planned food 
concepts. For example, students could previ
ously choose pasta that would be boiled upon 
ordering at Roselis. Now, there is now only 
lone type Cf pasta available on a given day, 
which sits in a bin. Pizza, previously made 
fresh, now its under heat lamps. Though pre
cooking fo d might speed up service, the cur

1 Perhaps; even more generic is the 
Marketplace concept. While the addition of 
'healthier Items, such as more vegetarian 
meals, is t<j be commended, the implementa
tion of a \jilue meal has failed due to poor 
planning kid promotion. Such meals are not 
consistently promoted with signs and the 
servers ofti do not appear to be informed 
about the options. In addition, the food 
offered doesnot cater to the  la carte concept 
promoted. \ For example, when Chicken

While Highlander has always been the prob
lem child of Dining -Services, recent changes 
will do little to improve it. As with the changes 
in the University Center, the primary changes 
are aesthetic. Highlanders: food was never 
especially appetizing, but its one' attraction to 
students was that it was an "all yoti care to eat" 
establishment. Although Dining Services is 
trying to address this concern with largel por
tions, it was not only the quantity of foocl but 
also the freedom to eat a variety of small por
tions of items that made Highlander unique. 
Now, as an a la carte dining area, it is not dif
ferentiated from any of the other eating areas 
on campus, most of which have better food. 
While Dining Services acknowledges that the 
customer count has decreased, they expect 
that as students find out more about the posi
tive changes, it will increase. More likely, how
ever, students will turn to independently oper
ated establishments such as Taste of India or 
The Fluted Mushroom as they realize that the 
food is better and the prices are more reason
able.
Highlander and the other Dining Services 
vendors should be reevaluated at the end of the 
semester to see if they are really serving stu
dents needs. Also, at least one decision can be 
made correctly. Now that Ali Baba is no longer 
in the UC, its replacement should be carefully 
decided upon with plenty of student input.
While it is inevitable that University stu
dents will always complain about campus 
food, Dining Services needs to be receptive to 
student needs. , Although they have made 
efforts to listen to student feedback, some 
common sense must be used when implement
ing these suggestions.
: Since th Purnell Centers completion 
iover a year !ago/ the building has been, in 
many waysja positive addition to the camIpus. Carnegie Mellon has received media 
attention because of it, and it provides per
forming artists with a top-notch stage, and 
Visual artis:s with a fitting gallery for their 
;wqfk. Its construction created much-needed 
space foe other CFA students as well. 
HoWevfer, many students feel distant, from 
land unwelcome in the Purnell Center.
! This feeling stems from an already exist
ing schism between the Drama department 
and the rest of the University - partially an 
rintentional effect, given the conservatory 
nature of the College of Fine Arts. However, 
that does not excuse that students often do 
:not feel welcome or even allowed in Purnell. 
The building should not exclude people, but 
instead help bridge the gap between Drama 
-and other departments.
The building was financed and designed 
for the Drama departments needs, equiptping it with sorely needed classrooms/and 
rehearsal space. Administrators have a 
responsibility to involve a larger portion of 
"CMUs students and faculty in Purnells 
activities. It occupies an extremely/visible 
space on campus for students and passersby. The entire campus dealt with the 
unsightly construction site for two vears and 
;now has lost part of the Cut to the building 
itself. Therefore, everyone should be wel
comed into Purnell. /
! If nothing else, the administrators of the 
Purnell center should attempt to bridge the 
.gap by hosting a Purnell Centex open house. 
The grand opening for the building was not 
{well publicized, and planners did not pre
sent the event as being open to the whole 
.community. If students feel invited into the 
Juilding once, and see it tieing well used,
they may not feel estranged from Purnell. 
An open house could consist of a concert 
series, giving numerous performing groups 
on campus a chance to perform in the 
Chosky Theater.
Although several parts of Purnell are only 
useful to the Drama Department, other sec
tions should be opened up for other mem
bers of the community. The building offers a 
complete television studio - a largely 
unknpwn, but top-notch resource. 
Organizations such as CMU TV and SDC 
hav recently been looking for equipment 
and space to broadcast their shows.
Opening up the building to others can be 
accomplished without compromising the 
buildings original intentions. When not 
being used for rehearsals, performances, or 
classroom-related drama activities, Chosky 
Theater should be opened up for other 
events. The theatre is a great venue for not 
only CMU groups, but also outside shows, 
speakers, and music ensembles.
The coffee bar in Purnell is also widely 
unknown to many students on campus. 
Because the next closest coffee shop is 
Skibo in the UCs second floor, advertise
ments for the Purnell coffee shop could 
attract people coming from the west end 
of campus. If students came to the coffee 
bar, the lobby would be a more social 
space.
A common complaint among students is 
that all the majors and departments are sep
arated. To remedy this situation, the 
University publicly acknowledges the 
importance of interdisciplinary education. 
However, Purnells current status as an 
exclusive building without so much as a 
public eating area is contradictory to the 
goal of further integration among depart
ments.

Napster introduces RIAA to new economy
if
Ish Harshawat
Im obsessed. I cant help reading the 
latest and greatest about the recording 
industry versus the rest of the world. 
While I might have missed out on Days of 
Our Lives, General Hospital, or other sim
ilar soap operas, I have finally found a 
real-life drama that is just as captivating.
When I used a cluster last semester, I 
would check my email, maybe check the 
news on the Web, and that was it. But all 
the events surrounding Napster, the 
Recording Industry Association of 
America (RIAA), MP3.com, and others 
have drawn me to sites like zeropaid.com 
or slashdot.org. Here I can find the daily 
updates about how the big bad music 
industry is trampling upon the civil liber
ties of 20 million Internet users.
Im referring to a recent injunction 
that the RIAA filed against Napster to 
stop their service, which provides easy 
sharing of music in the mp3 format. 
The RIAA is suing Napster, claiming 
that it is infringing on their copyrights. 
For now, an appeals court has stayed 
the injunction, and the two sides will 
start battling things out in court next 
month.
If youve been reading as much as I 
have (and Ive read a lot) about this sub
ject, you will know that there is proba
bly much more at stake here than free 
music. The verdict that comes out of this 
case, as well as other similar cases 
around the country (Motion Pictures 
Association of America versus Scour, 
Inc. for instance) could radically shape 
the future of information distribution in
electronic form or not.
Even if the RIAA wins the court case, 
they wont be able to stop the distribution 
of free digital music. The information 
economy pretty much dictates that infor
mation by itself will be free because infor
mation cannot be treated as a commodity. 
An apple can be treated as a commodity 
because there is a limited supply, and so 
economics teaches us that at some point 
people will pay a price for this scarce 
resource. Information, such as an online 
document or a mp3, can be duplicated 
indefinitely. Therefore, even if it cost 
some money to create, it will eventually 
reach a price of zero.
The music industry already has solid 
commodities (CDs) that it sells at a price 
from which it make immense profits. 
Despite the increased distribution of 
mp3s through Napster and similar ser
vices, CD sales have not wavered, at least 
according to most accounts. The music 
industry is afraid that its days are num
bered, however, because electronic distri
bution over the Internet is on the rise, and 
maybe one day that will be the only way 
people will get music.
So the natural reaction would be to try 
to stop the distribution in its tracks (no 
pun intended). Then perhaps, the music 
industry thinks, it can step in and find a 
way to sell the music over the Internet for 
a profit. So far, the only way they know 
how to do this is to sell each song or 
album over the Internet. This wont work 
because digital music is information, and 
cannot be traded as a commodity.
If you dont believe, me, then just wait 
. until Freenet (www.freenet.com) comes 
into its own. Freenet is an online commu
nity that cannot be brought into court 
because it has no company behind it, and
users of the system cannot be tracked . 
down like on Napster because the infra
structure places heavy emphasis on 
anonymity. There will always be a way for I 
users to get information for free.
So what happens if Napster loses the  
lawsuit and goes out of business? The; 
RIAA attempts to start a similar service 
based on subscriptions, because that is 
the only way it can make money. As long 
as this service is easier to use and provides 
better service than something like 
Freenet, they will succeed.
And what happens if Napster wins? 
Eventually, the service will start making 
money through subscriptions or even 
advertising. Freenet or a similar commu
nity will still be there, and again, as longas Napster is easy to use and provides % 
added service, it will succeed.
So one might ask why I care so passionJ 
ately about the current court case and all~ 
the hoopla surrounding it, when in the";; 
end the outcome will be the same for cbn-* 
sumers. Perhaps it is because I feel the'; 
RIAA doesnt treat artists the way they_ 
ought to be treated, or perhaps Im bitter 
because Ive had to shell out $15 for a CD 
that should have cost much less (a lot of 
this might be due to illegal price-fixing on 
the part of the RIAA). The RIAA just does
nt have a good record with artists or con
sumers, so maybe it is time for a needed 
change.
When it is all said and done, however, 
Napster versus the RIAA is a classic David 
versus Goliath scenario. I read and care 
because it makes for a really entertaining 
story.
Ish Harshawat would be very happy if 
someone wrote him a letter saying that he . 
or she is rooting for the other guys.
Gores burdensome tax plan drains workers
Damian Olesnycky
When I read an article covering Vice 
President Al Gores long-range eco
nomic plan that he released this past 
Wednesday, I couldnt help feeling that 
he was promising America too much at 
the expense of the middle and upper 
class. Although the plan offers many 
noble objectives to help struggling fam
ilies, women, the elderly, and the poor, 
such goals would be honorable to 
achieve because the government 
should most definitely aid the less for
tunate in any way that it can. Gores 
expensive proposal to do so on many 
fronts also entails protecting social 
security into the second half of this 
century, gradually retiring the 
nations publicly held debt, strengthen
ing Medicare, increasing educational 
funding significantly, as well as tar
geting tax cuts for the typical 
American family. The plan certainly 
promises an awful lot of ventures (like 
more social programs and increased 
spending) on top of the crusades to 
alter and strengthen core government 
programs.
I liken the economic proposal to a 
pipe dream that Gore expects 
| Americas taxpayers to shell out the 
! cash for. My rationale is that there 
seems to be simply too much national 
budget surplus spending at the top of 
the plans agenda, and that the middle 
and upper class will wind up without 
any significant tax relief. The surplus 
exists because it came out of the wal
lets of hard-working taxpayers, so its 
simply not fair to target middle class 
tax cuts while spending outrageous 
amounts of money on government pro
grams.
I look at tax cutting as one of Gores 
lower priorities for a number of rea
sons. One reason is that he supports a 
Clinton Administration taxing regimen 
that reaches far and wide for its funds. 
For example, Gore supported President 
Clintons vetoing bills that would have
Bushs economic plan, on the other 
hand, provides funding for Medicare, 
Social Security, education, and defense 
on top of major tax relief for every per
son paying income taxes. The proposal 
is much more fiscally centralized than 
Gores, with several core programs ; 
serving as the bulk of federal funding. 
One of the biggest differences between 
the two plans is that the tax cuts are, 
much bigger and more explicitly 
ensured in the Bush plan, exploitingI liken the economic proposal to a pipe dream 
that Gore expects Americas taxpayers to shell 
out the cash for.
completely eliminated the Estate and 
Marriage Taxes. The Estate Tax charges 
people for dying and the Marriage Tax 
charges married couples for having two 
sources of income.
Another reason that I see tax cuts as a 
low priority for Gore is his devotion to 
his federal programs. On the campaign 
trail, the vice president stresses 
Medicare and education much more 
than middle-class tax cuts. He also 
plans on spending twice as much as 
Republican candidate George W. Bush 
on these two subjects (combined) if 
elected. Medicare will be overly budget
ed, with drug coverage including 
unneecessary treatments such as bald
ness remedies. With no realistic system 
for teacher incentive and accountability 
presented, many Americans feel that 
Gores proposed spending on education 
is excessive as well.
how weak the Gore proposal is in that 
area.
The Bush plan should serve as a col
lective breath of fresh air to those 
whose money is thrown into the sur
plus, while still providing relief to 
those who need it. The wishful think
ing disguised as peripheral social pro
grams and increased spending pro
posed by Gore has good intentions, but 
hard-working people should not have 
to pay such excessive taxes (Estate and 
Marriage) to pay for them. Perhaps the 
Democratic Party should stop taking 
the successful American people and 
their hard work for granted. I sure feel 
that they should.

Everything rocks!I think it was a swell little party they 
had.
I liked that it was in a different loca

Sean Mintus
After coming to understand the fact that 
I managed to vex individuals on both sides 
of the smoking coin last week, I decided 
that this column would be best spent con
tributing to my ongoing, life
long effort to piss off as many 
people as possible.
The problem is, either the 
world has become less offen
sive of late, or I simply 
stopped paying attention. 
Nevertheless, 1 hung in there 
and came up with a relatively 
interesting issue on which to 
speak. After all, its not like I 
would sacrifice the time and 
effort required to do any 
research and tackle a matter 
of great international impor
tance. So after many long 
hours of fierce introspection 
and contemplation, I came 
upon a section of society that 
tries its best to seem inoffen
sive and contributive, always 
supposedly working toward 
the greater good, but which at 
the core strikes me as evil 
incarnate. Who better to deal 
on than the peaceful, defense
less imbeciles known as envi
ronmentalists?
Sure, weve all seen them.
They picket in front of facto
ries. They protest aerosols. They chain 
themselves to heavy machinery in an 
attempt to cease deforestation, only to be 
horribly mutilated when some random 
union lackey fires up the bulldozer and 
helps the hippie shuffle off this mortal coil. 
Some, for instance, me, would like to point 
out the irony and sheer humor in a green 
peace soldier being squashed by a forty ton 
dozer, thus contaminating with their vile 
bodily secretions the very earth they were 
trying to protect.
Now, dont get me wrong. I see nothing 
wrong with people having convictions. I
have, do, and always will believe that life 
would be best spent in a drug and/or alco
hol-induced haze resulting in nothing 
other than the complete and utter decay of 
ones body from the inside out. I fight 
vehemently every day of my life to hold 
true to these ideals.
But seriously, cant anyone find anything 
better to do than whine about oil spills and 
the polar ice caps melting? The awful and
to them. This is my main beef with envi
ronmentalists. I find their whining and 
complaining to be nSthing more than a 
grossly inaccurate statement of selfimportance. The very thought that we 
humans could in any way profoundly 
affect a planet this large, powerful, and 
old is absurd. Environmentalists need to 
start thinking a little less of themselves, 
buy a car with horrid, barely legal emishilarious truth is that this planet had been 
around for billions of years before humans 
showed up, and will continue to exist after 
we die, or, more appropriately, kill ourselves 
off. All of our efforts, both intentional and 
unintentional, to eradicate any and all li
ability this planet possesses will appropriate
ly result in one thing and one thing only: our 
demise.
All of the chemicals, all of the radiation 
and the poisons we pump into the land, 
sea and sky were never even considered 
hazardous until human beings started 
keeling over as a result of their exposure
sion levels, and drive it off the nearest 
cliff.
While Im on the subject of people with 
stupid causes, let me briefly address vegetar
ians. The term vegetarian, as I understand 
it, is Latin for bad hunter, and describes all 
those who actively avoid eating meat. Now, 
there are two specific types of vegetarians. 
The first are those who either do not enjoy, 
or have some sort of fierce allergic reaction 
to meat. These people, as far as Im con
cerned, are fine. Unlucky, but fine. They 
simply dont eat what doesnt agree with 
them. I can respect that.
The second group consists of those who 
refuse to eat meat because its meat. They 
find something wrong with the practice of 
tearing into a hot, steaming chunk of raw 
flesh, feeling the tissue buckle under the 
stress of your molars, and listening just 
carefully enough to almost hear the terri
fied wails of the former beast as its thigh 
or wing or earlobe (if youre eating 
sausage) plummets toward your bubbling 
stomach juices. (Yes, that 
description was an attempt to 
be as graphic and offensive as 
possible.) These self-pro
claimed animal lovers are, 
amusingly enough, the same 
people who wear leather 
shoes and carry alligator 
purses. But that is neither 
here nor there.
You know what I think would 
be great? A vegetarian vs. envi
ronmentalist deathmatch. I can 
see it now. The environmental
ists would be pissed at the veg
etarians because they eat crap 
like bean sprouts, which rob 
Mother Nature of her beautiful 
green bounty. The vegetarians 
would be pissed at the environ
mentalists because, well, if 
grass and tofu were your 
dietary staples, youd be pretty 
irritable too. Seriously, lets set 
this up. Ill supply the weapons. 
The environmentalists get 
chicken bones, the vegetarians 
leaky oilcans. Hopefully theyll 
kill each other off and I can go 
back to devouring another slain 
carcass and littering the ground with its 
entrails without having to hear anyone 
whine.
Okay, I think thatll do it for now. But I 
will close by saying that this article was 
printed on paper made solely from the 
cores of 10,000 saplings, and in ink 
squeezed from the innards of live baby 
octopi with a rusty carrot press. Hope you  
enjoyed it.

Professional sports drain coffers, offer Pittsburgh civic pride
just find it ironic that the Steelers were steel mills. It has been the success and Pittsburgh is with the construction of a
Erin Lucas
There has been a heated debate in recent 
years about the allocation of public funds 
for the use of privately owned sports fran
chises. Pittsburgh has become a prime can
didate for discussion with the construction 
of two new stadiums financed primary by 
tax money.
Another illustration of this issue can be 
seen in Canada where four of the countrys 
six NHL hockey clubs are on the brink of 
collapse. Earlier this year a proposal to allot 
each of the struggling franchises $2 million 
a year in tax money was being discussed. 
Although this subsidy would have played a 
huge part in ensuring the future of hockey 
in Canada, the government decided it was 
inappropriate to use public funds for pri
vate enterprises and the law was struck 
down. Although technically this may have 
been the right thing to do, you now can 
expect most of Canadas hockey clubs to 
head south of the border within the next 
couple of years.
Within the past year people have argued 
back and forth whether it is right to spend 
millions of dollars in tax money to build the 
Pirates and Steelers their new stadiums. It 
probably isnt, but we are doing it anyway. I
just find it ironic that the Steelers were 
appraised last week as being worth almost 
half a billion, yes billion, dollars and claim 
they need enormous subsidies for their new 
stadium. With all the money the Rooneys 
saved on the stadium, maybe now they will 
be willing to spring for a competent quarter
back. The sad fact is that a by-product of 
modern professional sports is the ability of 
teams to blackmail cities into subsidizing 
their business costs. Team owners are always 
threatening to move their franchises to a ran
dom southern hillbilly city if their demands 
are not met. Host cities always seem to buck
le under the pressure.
If you cut all emotional ties towards your 
favorite team and look at the situation 
from an outsiders viewpoint, it appears 
utterly ridiculous for a city to spend tax 
dollars to assist a private corporation. 
Sports franchises are businesses that exist 
to make a profit like any other company. 
The argument that sports teams create jobs 
and elicit spending is a fine one. However, 
it must be reconciled with the fact that 
Heinz and Alcoa do the same thing for 
Pittsburgh, yet we do not build their facto
ries for them. I personally dont mind my 
tax money being used to build stadiums. 
My reason for this is the civic pride and 
unity hosting a sport teams provides the 
city. Pittsburgh is a relatively small and 
obscure American city that has no real 
defining feature since the close of all the
steel mills. It has been the success and 
widespread popularity of Pittsburgh teams 
across the country and throughout the 
world that has kept this city on the map.
As a typical child of Pittsburgh, I have 
spent my life watching the Penguins and 
Steelers religiously. They have been a main 
interest in my life for as long as I can 
remember. If one of the citys three teams 
were to leave, I would feel like someone 
had cut my hand off. I dont think I am 
alone in this feeling. That is why 
Pittsburgh is willing to pay extraordinary 
amount of money to build stadiums for its 
teams. Sports are as much a part of 
Pittsburgh and its residents as the three 
rivers and tailgating.
The argument is not over, howeve. Even 
if a city deems it proper to assist its sport 
franchises. There is another large issue 
that is never discussed. What is the proper 
way to allocate funds between teams rep
resenting the same city? Pittsburgh is a 
perfect example of this problem as well. 
First you have the Pirates, who have been 
teetering on the brink of collapse for a 
long time now. The city has repeatedly 
bailed them out and is now building the 
team the sweetest ballpark in the country. 
Next we have the Penguins who are just 
climbing out of bankruptcy. Although their 
short run finances appear promising, 
Mario Lemieux claims the only way for the 
team to succeed in the long run in
Pittsburgh is with the construction of ; 
new arena. And finally we have the 
Steelers, Pittsburghs favorite son. The city 
has bent over backwards to accommodate 
and assist this franchise, even though they 
are financially stable, and dont appear to 
need much help. With three teams 
demanding the citys attention and money, 
how do public officials prioritize? In 
Pittsburgh it seems to be a popularity con
test, and the Steelers have and always will 
be first in line.
I first must disclose my extreme bias 
towards hockey before I share my ideas on 
how Pittsburgh should allocate funds 
between its teams. I say build Mario his sta
dium. The Penguins are the only team in the 
city that are competitive within their league 
and have been for over a decade, 
there is a legitimate chance that the 
could make it to the Stanley Cup finals. 
Mellon Arena is the oldest forum being 
in the NHL today.
It is up to the individual city to balance the 
benefits of hosting a sports franchise with 
the improper financial burdens they create. 
Hovvever, if my tax money that should be 
spent fixing potholes on Fifth Avenue is 
being used to retile Art Rooneys pool house, 
that is fine with me.

THE TARTAN  SEPTEMBER II. 2000
Mens soccer team wins second game, 2-0
SOCCER, from page 14 
a perfect cross to Leonhard, who 
coolly struck a one-time volley back 
to the right post. Once again, the 
goalkeeper was left frozen in his 
tracks and the score was 2-0.
With just under 20 minutes 
remaining in the half, the 
Waynesburg offense suddenly 
began to find its footing, maintain
ing pressure on the Tartans 
defense for most of the remainder 
of the half.
Despite Waynesburgs surge, 
CMU show.ed great poise in repeat
edly clearing crosses before they 
could be turned into shots on goal. 
The only serious threat Dougherty 
had to deal with came with just 
under five minutes remaining 
when he made a strong run to the 
top of the penalty box to break up a 
potential breakaway.
The Tartans got the last chance
of the half when Hibshmans shot 
was saved with about 1:30 left in 
the half. Hibshman also got a head 
to the resulting corner kick, but his 
effort missed the net and the half 
ended with the score still 2-0 in 
favor of CMU.
Continuing their strong play 
from the end of the first 45 min
utes, Waynesburg opened the sec
ond half with more sustained pres
sure, but was still unable to break 
through and generate quality scor
ing chances.
What had been a physical but 
clean game through the first half 
began to get out of hand early in 
the second. The number of fouls 
increased dramatically, culminat
ing in the games first yellow card 
being shown to Crummy for a retal
iatory shove on a Waynesburg 
defender after suffering an 
obstruction foul.
The Tartans quickly recovered 
from both that incident and the 
Waynesburg pressure as Hibshman 
began to take control of the 
offense. Beating three defenders on 
his way to the goal, Hibshman 
began his efforts to catch up with 
Tepper for the teams scoring lead 
with a hard shot that was met with 
a good save.
Undaunted, Hibshman contin
ued his one-man assault on the 
Waynesburg goal with several 
high-powered shots over the 
remainder of the game. The goal
keeper was up to the task on each 
occasion, however, keeping 
Hibshman off of the score sheet.
Also contributing to the offensive 
attack were Tepper, Zupon, and 
Crummy who each had at least one 
close-range chance that was either 
saved or just missed wide.
One of the best chances of the
half came from sophomore mid
fielder James Chung, a second-half 
substitute, who collected a cross 
from Arbuckle with a defender on 
his back but couldnt guide the ball 
on net.
The Tartans last chance of the 
game went to first-year defenseman Eric Buhman. His effort was 
also saved, however, and the 
Tartans had to settle for a 2-0 win.
For the second consecutive 
game, Dougherty earned a shutout 
by making only one save, thanks to 
a combination of a tough CMU 
defense and poor execution on 
offense by Waynesburg.
The Tartans will go on the road 
for the first time this season for 
their next game against Mount 
Union on Wednesday, September 
13. They will be back at home on 
Sunday, September 17 to face 
Oberlin College.

Tartans record improves to 2-0
Shalna McGrath/Assistant Photo Editor
The men's soccer team now has a record of 2-0, after defeating Waynesburg at home last Wednesday. They play at 
Mt. Union this Wednesday, the first away game of the season.
by Matt BrunSpecial Projects Manager
Opening the season with a pair 
of games at home can give a team a 
much-needed boost when it finally 
heads out on the road. That is espe
cially true if a team plays as well as 
Carnegie Mellon mens soccer has 
in its two season-opening contests.
With a 4-0 win over the 
University of Pittsburgh at 
Greensburg already under their 
belts, the Tartans continued their 
winning ways with a similarlyimpressive 2-0 win over 
Waynesburg College last Friday 
night.
Unlike the game against 
Greensburg, Fridays contest saw 
the Tartans start on the offensive, 
registering the games first shot 
after barely 20 seconds of play. The 
first real scoring chance came not 
long after the Tartans earned the 
first of their three corner lacks.
Junior midfielder Steve Tepper, 
the hero of the Greensburg game, 
sent a well-struck cross into the 
box where the Waynesburg goal_ keeper was forced to come off of 
his line to punch the ball away
from the head of sophomore for
ward Matt Crummy and an almost 
sure goal.
CMU continued to control the 
action for some time after the play, 
but seemed . to have problems 
adjusting to Waynesburgs use of 
the offside trap in the defense. 
Forced to rely on long through balls 
to find openings in the drawn-up 
defense, the Tartans were out of 
sync just enough to miss several 
would-be scoring chances.
Defensively, the Tartans showed 
no such coordination problems, 
teaming up quickly and effectively 
to hold the Waynesburg forwards 
at bay. For the first 20 minutes of 
the game, the only dangerous 
chance the Tartans allowed was a 
free lack called for a handball on 
first-year midfielder Mike 
Leonhard. The chance was a wast
ed one, however, as junior goal
keeper Tom Dougherty watched 
the kick sail wide of the post to his 
left.
When the Tartans were able to 
beat the Waynesburg trap, the most 
common target was first-year 
defenseman Ken Arbuckle, who 
used his speed to great advantage 
racing down the right sideline.
Whether taking the shot himself or 
playing crosses in to Tepper and 
Crummy, Arbuckle was the key to 
the Tartans offense in the first half.
After recording the Tartans first 
shot on goal, Arbuckle set up 
CMUs best offensive chance of the 
opening twenty minutes by draw
ing a foul deep in Waynesburg ter
ritory. Tepper again took the kick, 
and his cross dropped right at the 
feet of senior midfielder David 
Zupon, whose volley attempt just 
missed wide.
Moments after Zupons near 
miss, the Tartans were finally 
rewarded for their efforts in the 
offensive end of the field when 
sophomore forward Adam 
Hibshman let loose a quick shot 
from just outside the penalty box. 
The Waynesburg goalkeeper could 
only stand and watch helplessly as 
the ball sailed into the back of the 
net at the far post to give CMU a
1-0 lead.
The Tartans were far from done, 
however, as Tepper teamed up with 
Leonhard to extend the lead less 
than a minute later. Chasing down 
a through ball on the right side, 
Tepper beat the defense and lofted

Tartans outsmart Spartans, 
45-14 in the Academic Bowl
by Brad GrantzBusiness Editor
It seems no matter what Case 
Western Reserve does, it always 
finishes second-best to CMU. The 
most recent rankings of the 
nations top universities ranked 
CWRU as the 38th best national 
university, while Carnegie Mellon 
placed 23rd. In this past 
Saturdays prestigious Academic 
Bowl, Case once again fell short of 
CMUs academic and athletic 
prowess, 45-14.
The Tartans improved to 2-0 
(1-0 UAA) behind the tremendous 
rushing attack, which used the 
running back-by-committee 
approach.
CMU wasted little time putting 
six points on the board. 
Reminiscent of last weeks 69 yard 
strike to Mike McLaughlin, junior 
quarterback Eric Zimpfer connect
ed with McLaughlin on the third 
play of CMUs first drive for a 61 
yard touchdown.
There was little Case could do to 
prevent McLaughlin from getting 
behind its defensive secondary. In 
addition to the TD bomb, 
McLaughlin was open twice in the 
first half for sure touchdowns, 
both times getting behind the dou
ble coverage of the Case sec
ondary, but Zimpfer was unable to 
activate the connection. Zimpfer 
did find McLaughlin at the outset 
of the fourth quarter for a 32 yard 
TD.
Zimpfer also overthrew Matt 
Strohl late in the second quarter 
on a post pattern. Despite the 
missed opportunities, Zimpfer fin
ished the afternoon 4 for 8, pass
ing for 98 yards.
The Tartans wasted little time 
adding to their lead. After a Case 
punt, CMU used its ground gain to 
go ahead 12-0. Ricardo Clarkes
27 yard scamper added to the first 
years impressive season. Clarke 
rushed 11 times for 86 yards.
Hes learning what to do, and 
the more he learns, the better hes 
going to do, said offensive coordi
nator Rich Erdelyi. He has great 
instincts and follows his blocking 
well.
Clarke wasnt the only back to 
shine in the romp. Ten additional 
backs of the Wing T offense car
ried the ball en route to an unbe
lievable 456 rushing yards.
Shortly after Mike Palmer 
redeemed his two missed point 
after touchdowns with a 29-yard 
field goal, CMU marched 93 
yards in 16 plays to extend thenlead to 22-0. Andrew Garrod was 
largely responsible for the late 
second quarter drive. Garrod car
ried the ball nine times for 99 
yards. However, the turning 
point of the drive came after 
Zimpfer was injured on a bootleg 
play.
Backup first-year quarterback 
Mike Wykosky entered the game 
with a third and 13 play at the Case
28 yard line. Wykosky connected 
with junior wideout Matt 
Saneholtz for 15 yards to keep the 
drive alive and kill all Spartan hope 
of a recovery. Adam Urbanczyk 
plummeted into the end zone on 
one of his eight carries.
Cases glimmer of hope came 
after a Zimpfer pass was picked off 
and returned 45 yards to nirvana 
by Case cornerback Joe Orlandini.
Besides a blocked punt carried 
into the end zone for Cases only 
other TD, CMU controlled every 
aspect of the game. The defense 
allowed a mere 19 yards rushing 
and only 57 through the air.
While CMU registered only one 
sack, the D gave Case constant 
headaches, courtesy of witch doc
tors/defensive lineman Mark 
Reiner and Brian Lenhart.
Tartan notes: After an out
standing performance against 
Denison, the UAA uniquely hon
ored a Carnegie Mellon offensive 
lineman as player of the week: 
Mike Pignatiello.
Erdelyi commented, Hes a 
leader on the field and is a great 
inspriation to our younger players 
on the offensive line.
Sophomore running back Chris 
Rose saw his first action of the sea
son versus Case, after missing last 
weeks Denison game with an 
ankle' injury. Rose rushed for 19 
yards on four carries.
Whos next
Bethany College (2-0) v. CMU 
(2-0) (Saturday, 7:00 pm, Geisling 
Stadium)
Last meeting: 1999, CMU 17, 
Bethany 10
The skinny: The Bethany 
College squad returns 13 starters 
from last years 4-6 squad, includ
ing 7 men on defense. This should 
be the first real test of the season 
for a young, athletic CMU team.
Watch for: Bethany Junior QB 
Justin Green started six games last 
year and made great strides at the 
close of the season. RB Brandon 
Isbell, of Monessen, PA, rushed for 
860 yards as a freshman last season 
and will split time with Will 
Anderson (457 yards in 1999).
If CMU shows signs of trouble on 
offense, look for Ricardo Clarke, a 
true freshman, to enter the game as 
left halfback and provide a spark on 
offense.
The result: CMU will, as 
always, need to use its running 
game to work the quick strike 
between QB Eric Zimpfer and WR 
Mike McLaughlin. CMU 17, 
Bethany 13.
Tournament yields two wins for Tartans
by Nathan SteinwaldContributing Editor
On Saturday, Carnegie Mellons womens 
volleyball held its first home tournament of 
the season. After finishing fourth in the 
Mount Union Tournament last weekend 
and defeating Carlow College 3-2 on 
Friday, the team hosted three regional col
leges  Waynesburg, St. Vincent, and 
Daemon  for round-robin play.
The team that CMU put on the floor was 
much different from last years 40-6 ECAC 
Champions. Gone are UAA player of the 
year Stephanie Svotoba and ECAC MVP 
Sarah Putaro. This weekends team even 
lacked sophomore sensation Lauren 
Schmidt, who was an All-UAA player last 
year and was an All-Tournament selection 
last week.
Here instead was a team of mostly firstyears and sophomores, but one that Coach 
Julie Webb still expects to do well.
The Tartans won their first match of the 
day, 3-0. However, the match wasnt as 
easy as the score indicates. Each game was 
hard-fought, and the inexperience of CMU 
showed.
In the second match, the Tartans were 
pushed to five games, but beat St. Vincent 
3-2 in the end. The third match, against 
Daemen, featured a better and more expe
rienced team than CMU had faced all day.
The Tartans opened the first game by 
taking an early 6-1 lead. However, as 
quickly as CMU had built itself a cushion, 
Daemon came back. The teams traded 
points until Carnegie Mellon finally got

so far this year, including this past weekend.
stuck at 12 points and Daemon took the 
game.
In the second game, it was Daemon who 
took the early lead and CMU who stormed 
back, but as the teams approached 15, the 
result was the same, with CMU losing
10-15 this time.
The third game began closer than the 
first two, but halfway through, the Tartans 
once again broke down, and lost the third 
game and the match because of their 
inability to push Daemon as the games 
drew to a close.
We have a very young team and it 
showed, said Webb. Freshmen mistakes 
lolled us. Hopefully it will light a fire under 
us to come in and [win].
Although the Tartans ended the day on a 
down note, they completed the day with
out two of their best players, Schmidt and 
Amy Bergvall. Webb expects that the 
return of these two players will have an 
impact on the outcome of later matches for 
Carnegie Mellon.
Lauren is the cornerstone of our team, 
said Webb. But even without her I expect
ed a better showing today.
With the return of their more experi
enced leaders Webb expects better play 
next week when CMU travels to the Case 
Western/John Carroll tournament. In the 
week of practice ahead the team will focus 
on good aggressive serves, working under 
pressure, working as a team, and defense, 
defense, defense, said Webb.
A rebuilding year with that many priori
ties is usually a lot to ask a team, but the 
Tartans strive to remain competitive and 
constantly look to the future.

Sports ShortsWomens soccer wins first game
Carnegie Mellon womens soccer 
finally , captured its first victory of the 
season, after two close 1-0 losses to 
Johns Hopkins last week and Allegheny 
this past Wednesday. Playing at Mt. 
Union on Saturday, both the Tartan 
defense and offense played solidly and 
kept the opposition at bay  Mt. Union 
was limited to seven shots on goal, and 
CMU scored both its goals in the middle 
of the opening half.
Maya Nigrosh and Alex Summers 
made two saves each in goal; Allison 
Styer scored the first goal for the 
Tartans off a steal and assist by Kim 
Celone; and about eight minutes later, 
Shanna Tellerman followed up Merry 
McConnochies shot, which was 
blocked by the Mt. Union keeper, for 
the Tartans second goal.
The team (1-2) now returns to cam
pus to play under the lights at Gesling 
Stadium. The Tartans look to continue 
playing well when they host Grove City 
at 7:30 pm on Tuesday evening.
Baseball opens fall season with win
Tartan baseball started the fall season 
right where it left off last spring  get
ting better and stronger. After a brief 
series of practices last week, the team 
played its first game of the season this 
past Wednesday and defeated Penn 
State-New Kensington by a score of
11-6.
The Tartans never trailed in the 
game, one in which five players had at 
least two hits and offensive production 
took the burden off the pitching staff. 
Rafael Taveras was 3-5, Matt Lucas 
went 2-2 with two RBIs, and Ramon 
Pooh was 3-5 with two runs scored and 
one RBI.
The Tartans pitched effectively, 
putting on the mound Jon Mayes (2-2 
in the game), Jay McCormick, and Dan 
Bogard (3-4, two RBI, two runs 
scored), who closed out the game by 
striking out the side in the bottom of 
the seventh inning.
The next game for the Tartans (1-0) 
is on Saturday at the University of 
Pittsburgh at Greensburg, a doubleheader.
Tennis teams in good form

This past week, the mens tennis team 
met Allegheny at home on Thursday, 
September 7, and the womens team 
played matches against Penn StateBehrend, Fredonia, and Allegheny, at 
Allegheny on Saturday.
In the mens match, five of the six sin
gles matches and all three doubles 
matches were won by the Tartans, 
putting the final score at 6-1.
The women finished Saturdays 
matches with two wins and one loss, 
despite the absences of their first and 
second singles players, Elizabeth Brown 
and Annie Bosler, both of whom will be 
back on the court in the next week or 
two. The Tartan women defeated Penn 
State-Behrend 42, Fredonia 6-0, and 
they lost to Allegheny 0-6.
I thought the women played very 
well, said head coach Peter Moss. 
...They did well considering we didnt 
have our top two players.
The tennis teams head to Rochester 
this weekend to play several matches.

Rusted Root drummer Jim Donovan speaks about music, creativity, and life
by Joanna SmileyArts and Living Editor
On Friday, September 8th, Rusted Root visited CMU, putting on a con
cert that was to say theleast incredible. In an exclusive interview with drum
mer Jim Donovan, five students at CMU had the opportunity to discuss every
thing from musical influences to what its like to live in an illustrious world 
that crosses somewhere between illusion and reality.
(Editors Note: Four students from other organizations at CMU also par
ticipated in asking some of the questions at this interview and are as fol
lows: Karari Hanks, Elsie Lampl, Guido Zarrella, and Amy Solana. CMU 
indicates when someone other than The Tartan asked a question.)
CMU: What is the weirdest question you have ever been asked at an 
interview?
Jim: The weirdest question I think have ever been asked is Where did 
you get the name Rusted Root from? Its funny because Imake up a story 
every time someone asks me this. My personal favorite was the time that 
I told someone I was playing drums in a far away place called Lipsburg 
(not to be confused with Pittsburgh) and that I suddenly kept digging up 
these bulbs that were all rusted. I said that there were at least 30 million 
of them and that they were coming out of everywhere. I told them that 
this all took place in a totally separate lifetime, before people even, and I 
yet was there.
CMU: Do you like being interviewed?
Jim: I like being interviewed by intelligent people. I like engaging in 
conversation, you know what I mean, intelligent dialogue that goes back 
and forth. I enjoy when I can tell that people aFe doing what they love, 
whether that is interviewing someone or playing an instrument.
The Tartan: Does it feel nostalgic to you at all, playing in Pittsburgh 
where you guys first started out?
Jim: This is actually one of our first real college experiences. You can 
really feel the friendliness. Its the same syndrome the Steelers used to 
have, micro-nationalism. Pittsburgh is this great little city that's so proud 
of itself and anything that comes from it.
CMU: What is your favorite place youve ever played a show at or for 
that matter been to at all?
Jim: Definitely Red Rocks, Colorado. It was visually striking to be 
there. Also, Lincoln, Nebraska had this tiny club out in the middle of a 
field, which was so much fun. It was a free-forall party. The most exhil
aration is when music and creativity are high. There was also the Red 
Wood Forest, in Northern California, which was breathtaking. And the Aberry circle, in the U.K., we played a show there in 1995, and we were so 
excited to just get out of the monolithic of North America and play, in a 
place with so much history and so much to see.
TT: Whenever youre around in Pittsburgh, you organize a series of 
drum workshops. What enticed you to do this, and what are they all 
about?
Jim: Ive actually been teaching music all my life. As far as my drum
workshops, people come together from the community, thats the goal. I 
bring some extra drum sets in case anyone needs them. The whole 
process is so satisfying no matter how good or bad the music is. The next 
one will be on Friday, September 15.
TT: Have you always known that music was what you wanted to do with 
your life, or is there anything else youve envisioned?
Jim: Well, I grew up without a lot of money. I always loved music 
though, since as long as I can remember. I never could afford a drum set. 
I got my first one when I was 18 and I was so elated. As far as other things 
I see myself doing, I will always continue to teach music, thats something 
I love. I am also working on a book about rhythm and music and how it 
affects creativity. Im actually working with a woman from CMU on that.
TT: What types of music have you listened to or been influenced by 
throughout your life?
Jim: When I lived out in Mount Washington, Pennsylvania, where I 
grew up, I liked Motown Records and a lot of groove-based music. Then I 
moved out to Seven Springs and it was like Deliverance. Appalachia. The 
. music was so stale, I think there was maybe one radio station. So, I pret
ty much missed music in the late 70s. In high school, though, I listened 
to Van Halen, Zeppelin, Hendrix, Doors, late 60s jazz-fusion, later Miles 
Davis and early Davis. When I was at the University of Pittsburgh, I got 
really into a lot of African music from places like Ghana and Zaire, and 
that really changed my perception of music and what you can do with it. 
I listened to some stuff in Islamic nature and a lot of chanting and drumSee RUSTED ROOT, page L2
Student activities fair features 
wide variety of campus groups
by Emily LandesSenior Staffwriter
This past Friday, the Student Activities 
Fair drew many students interested in 
getting involved in campus clubs, as well 
as club members trying to draw in new 
recruits. Almost every organization, from 
long-standing staples like the Asian
Candy now, organiza
tions later. 
Emily Lauffer
Student Association, Society of Women 
Engineers, and the College Bowl to 
newer, less well-known niche groups like 
the Lindy Hop Club, had flyers and wellspoken club members at their tables in 
order to entice students into getting 
involved.
i .
A lot of the clubs also had food at their 
table, from the usual candy and lollipops 
to the homemade, house-shaped cookies 
provided by Habitat for Humanity. Some 
of the students admitted that it was the 
food as much as the prospect of getting 
involved that brought them out to the 
fair. Emily Lauffer, a first-year attending 
the fair, said that she was equally inter
ested in getting involved and getting free 
food, but that the food was a good way to 
get her thinking about the clubs in the 
future. Candy now, organizations later, 
said Lauffer, an electrical and computer 
engineering major.
Some organizations, however, went 
above and beyond the usual tactics of fly-- 
ers and free food. The CMU Robotics Club 
drew crowds with Jim 2, a large walk
ing robot designed in part by club mem
ber Jonathan Hurst. When robots move, 
it's a real attention getter, Said Hurst, a 
senior mechanical engineering major. 
Hurst also claims that due in part to Jim 
2 the organization had seen an increase
See FAIR TUESD AUStudents visit an Asian Students Association booth at Friday's Student Activities fair. Over 100 campus groups participated in the fair.

---------------------------------------------------

Jim: Life is a Sun, from When I Woke. Thats a 
great song.
CMU: Do you know what you play before you go on?
Jim: We have a set list, because there are so many 
different instruments coming together, weve got to be 
somewhat organized. In the beginning of a show, we try 
to get the crowds attention and slowly build on that.
TT: If you could tell people one lesson or realization 
that youve learned throughout your life, what would it 
be? *
Jim: I would tell them the same thing I said to my lit
tle sister before she left for college. Whatever it is that 
youre doing, dont hold back. Dont waste time worry
ing about fucking up. Millions of people in the world 
want to do what you dream of doing. Make sure that 
you love it with all your heart. It doesnt take a brain 
surgeon to be successful. You dont need to be the pret
tiest or funniest person in your class. My advice is to 
take chances. Thats why we have things in our world, 
from people who did just that. Its like what I tell peo
ple in my workshops, There are no mistakes in life, 
only learning experiences.

2000 Pittsburgh Theater New Works Festival features three one act plays
by Greg NofiEntertainment Editor
Ever hear of a one-act play with inter
missions? By attending the Pittsburgh 
New Works Festival, you will not only get 
two intermissions, but you will also wit
ness some great theater with three oneact pieces each week during the month
long event.
The 2000 New Works Festival marks
the tenth year of the event. Since its 
inception, the event has exploded in pop
ularity and is now held at the intimate 
Hamburg Studio Theatre, adjacent to 
City Theatre, in the South Side. 
Throughout September, the world pre
miere of 14 one-act repertory plays will 
be performed. Three of these can been 
seen each weekend, while the remaining 
two are childrens plays which will be 
presented later in the month. Each of the 
performances is produced by a different 
local troupe. A panel of 13 readers and
judges selected these 14 works from 115 
submissions.
This past weekend was jhe opening of 
the festival. The first play was titled Light 
and was produced by the McKeesport 
Little Theatre. Dr. Max Brennen, a phi
losophy professor, attempts to cope with 
and rationalize the continual memory 
loss of his wife, Maia, as she succumbs to 
Alzheimers Disease. The action is split 
between his suburban home and a lec
ture hall, where he reflects on his family 
affairs and mixes in philosophical tenets
courtesy of Thoreau New Mexico Production Company
Thoreau, New Mexico, a production company, presents "Thats Amore," written by Alice Searpantino and co-directed by Carol Ferguson and 
Lance Eric Skapura, at the Hamburg Studio Theatre. The play features Stephen Scull, Phyl Charnes, and Sally Randa.
during his class lessons. By overanalyz
ing the situation with his philosophical 
knowledge, he finds himself with a low 
amount of sorrow over his wifes afflic
tion, causing strife between him and his 
teenage daughter, who feels that he does 
not care about Maia.
Robert Isenberg, the writer and a 
senior at the University of Pittsburgh, did 
a commendable job of packing five 
years worth of events into a 40-minute 
one-act play. The disabling and ultimate 
death of Maia occurred at a comfortable 
pace that encouraged plenty of thought 
and reflection on what Alzheimers 
patients must see when the physical 
world comes across as a total stranger. In 
addition, Mark D. Yochums performance 
of Dr. Brennen was excellent and accu
rate with his college professor manner
isms.
The next play, Thats Amore, was much 
lighter and featured a dialogue that 
could be mistaken for a lost episode of All 
In The Family. Theresa Barcelli, played by 
Carnegie Mellon alumna Sally Randa, 
has brought her Irish boyfriend, Sean, 
home from college and wants her Italian 
grandparents, Maria and Francis, to meet 
him at her parents house. Seans family 
attends as well. The disparity between 
the two nationalities causes plenty of 
comedic material as Maria and Francis 
are worried that they will embarrass 
their daughter. Maria is the most con
cerned with keeping up appearances as 
she struggles to find the right dress to 
wear and the perfect food to bring in an 
Edith Bunker-like fashion. Meanwhile, 
Theresas impatience grows as Sean and 
his family wait to meet them at her par
ents house.
The play was a refreshing dose of com
edy and often had a sitcom feel to it. The 
performances were excellent, as the 
actors managed, to keep up with the swift 
dialogue of Stephanie Alice Scarpinatos 
script. Scarpinato is currently pursuing a 
masters degree in dramatic writing in 
the School of Drama at CMU.
The third and final play, produced by 
The Kuntu Repertory Theatre, created 
the most serious tone of the evening. 
Cells is the story of two cellmates: Ray, 
who is black, and Will, who is a white 
supremacist. In the first two scenes, they 
exchange dialogue about their lives and 
discover that their paths had crossed 
long before prison. Will slowly begins to 
shed some intolerance toward AfricanAmericans. In the third and last scene, 
they meet each other again a few years, 
later at Riverview Park, where Wills 
progress in understanding thas taken a 
major step backward.
The performance was intense, but also 
too dense. Too much time and character 
development were unsuccessfully 
squeezed into a half-hour, one-act pack
age. The powerful acting of the charac
ters made each individual scene riveting, 
but the story transition from scene to 
scene was a little rough around the 
edges.
For those who want to sample what 
Pittsburgh theater has to offer, the New 
Works Festival provides a great opportu
nity in a lively setting. Over the next few 
weeks, performances by the South Park 
Theatre, The Unseamd Shakespeare 
Company, and The Summer Company 
will be given. While the New Works 
Festival is open to companies outside the 
Pittsburgh area, 12 of the 14 plays are 
from local sources.
The remaining productions will be 
given on the weekends of September 14 -
17, September 21 - 24, and September 28
- October 1. Show times are Thursday 
and Friday at 8 pm, Saturday at 6 and 9 
pm, and Sunday at 4 and 7 pm. Tickets 
are $7.
To get to the Hamburg Studio Theatre, 
take a 61 or 67 bus toward Downtown. Get 
off at Smithfield Street and transfer onto a 
51 A or C. Take the 12th and Carson Street 
exit, and walk to the theater, located at 57 
South 13th Street, or take a 54C from 
Craig Street toward downtown.
Is the male/female disparity on campus problematic for women at CMU?
Less Stresss?
By: Emily Landes
You know those girls who, for one reason or another, never really feel 
comfortable around other girls? They connect better with guys, they 
have more in common with guys, and, therefore, all of their close 
friends seem to be guys. Well, that girl was never me. All my life, I have 
had twice as many girl friends as guy friends and I never really thought 
twice about it.
Then I came to Carnegie Mellon and suddenly my female friends 
have disappeared. Perhaps some of that has to do with the 3:2 male 
to female ratio at this school and perhaps some of it has to do with 
some changes to my personality during my three years here. I dont 
really know. What I do know is that, more often than not, Ive found 
myself in the minority in both social and academic situations (bar
ring my attendance at Titanic and one Romantic Poetry class sopho
more year).
Honestly, though, its been quite a while since Ive really noticed what 
the gender makeup of my friends has been. There have been many 
times when Ive gone out with a group of people and not realized that I 
was one of the only girls, or even the only girl, until much later, if at all. 
Funny as it seems, I think that because hanging out with guys has inex
plicably become a part of my life, its made me forget sometimes that I 
am, in fact, a woman.
This is not to say that I dont look like a woman (I cant remember the
last time I saw a guy in a three-quarter length skirt) nor that I dont get 
a reminder, loud and clear, once every 28 days that I do, in fact, possess 
two X-chromosomes. But it does mean that I often forget that many of 
the problems that I face will never affect my male counterparts.
But perhaps the most disheartening 
fact is that it simply is not safe for any 
woman to walk by herself. 
Of course there are many examples that prove this point: Women are 
much more likely than men to be abused by their spouses. The Bureau 
of Labor Statistics reported just this past May that women still earn 76.5 
cents on the dollar compared to men. Potential employers will never 
look at one of my young male friends and sigh, Wonder when hes 
going to ask for maternity leave?
Sadly, there are many other inequalities that could prove my point. But 
perhaps the most disheartening is that it simply is not safe for any woman 
to walk by herself. And unfortunately this is one of the many rules that my 
immersion among men leads me to constandy forget. After all, how many 
times have I watched my guy friends walk home in the wee hours of the 
morning without, any of us, giving even a moments thought to their safe
ty? How many times have they gone off strolling at night to either walk off 
a drunken haze or just get some time alone? Ive seen it happen so many
times that it has somehow made its way into my own subconscious: if they 
can do it, then so can I.
But recent events have forced me to remember that for whatever else 
I am, a passionate sci-fi reader, an avid curser, someone who enjoys 
sitting on the grass, even after its dark, I am also a woman. And it isnt 
safe for me to be alone. Particularly at night. Particularly in Pittsburgh. 
Particularly right now.
For those who have not heard, there is a serial rapist who remains at 
large in the Eastern Pittsburgh area. His last attack was as recently as 
August 8th, as close as Squirrel Hill. And even though all four victims 
were attacked in their homes, between the hours of 2 and 4 am, it has 
made me rethink all the little things that I used to take for granted.
Last year I recorded the message on my answering machine. This 
year I asked my male roommate to do it. Last year I almost always 
walked home in the dark. This year I take the shuttle bus home every 
night. Last year I never even thought to lock the door of my apartment 
before I went to bed. This year, its deadbolted.
Here at Carnegie Mellon, we as women often realize that were in the 
minority. Its a constant source of jokes and an occasional cause of frus
tration, but it can also lull us into thinking that the same rights and privi
leges that belong to our male friends are ours as well. And while that 
should of course be the case, it takes a devastating situation like a serial 
rapist to remind us that, unfortunately, it isnt.
Emily Landes is a woman. Hear her roar, from the safety of the shuttle 
bus.

his musical career and future plans
RUSTED ROOT, from page LI
ming repetition. What I really dont like is typical dance 
music, I prefer transcendental music, Native American, 
Bob Marley, Hinduwhen people sing to their God and 
their hearts are truly open.
TT: Rusted Root has been on tour with a wide vari
ety of incredible musical groups. What is it like to play 
with these musicians?
Jim: You really get a sense of their humanness and
who they are as people. Sometimes I pinch myself and 
think, man, how did I get here. But you know we never 
did achieve Britney Spears fame, thank God. Were real
ly all just people, like everyone else. All the fame and 
adorationits all a big illusion. All that hype isnt real. 
I mean your heroes may be really cool people. But, you 
cant know that without actually knowing them, 
humans by nature are so multi-faceted. Ive been 
extremely fortunate to have my wife, family, and other 
people around me who arent afraid to say something 
like, Jim, youre being an asshole. Ive seen a lot of sit
uations where its not helpful when no matter how poor
ly you play people tell you that youre great. You can 
start to believe that and forget about why youre playing 
in the first place. The fact is thats not the way the world 
really functions.
TT: Would you say that its challenging to keep a level 
head in this industry?
Jim: I know that my intentions are good and that I 
affect folks with my music. Music to me goes beyond 
just the rhythm and melody, it comes straight from the 
heart. Someone like Britney Spears,' for example, is an 
entertainer and as long as she is doing what she loves, 
who am I to denounce that? I think that kids need that, 
its okay for them to go crazy over Britney. Ill never buy 
the records, but lots of people will. Maybe in some tiny 
town in Idaho, Britney Spears is the one thing that caus
es someone to do something really important in his life.
CMU: If you could pick someone, alive or dead, to 
meet right now who would it be?
Jim: John Lennon. He always struck me as a hilari
ous and sarcastic idiot, and a musical genius. One hun
dred years back, I think I would have also liked to meet 
myself. A tarot card reader once told me I was a gener
al in the army during World War I and that I got slain. 
But who knows, sometimes those psychics tell you what 
you need to hear, and you hear it whether or not its 
even true.

Activities Fair has solid turn-out 
as students look to get involved
FAIR, from page LI
in the number of flyers handed out to interested students. The. Society for Creative 
Anachronism (SCA) also had success by showcasing their authentic looking medieval dress 
and weapons. Lena Katz, a sophomore physics major and the president of the CMU chapter 
of SCA, said that many students join the club because they are interested in the heavy 
weapons fighting that is displayed at the fair.
But not every organization draws students in by displaying eye-grabbers that are direct
ly related to their club. The Activities Board (AB), for example, showcased a Christmas in 
September theme, though Santa and his elves have no apparent correlation to the club. We 
just wanted to do something wild and crazy. Something that everybody loves, said Leslie 
Carr, an AB member. And everybody loves Christmas.
Carr, a sophomore chemistry major, also claims that while Santa might not directly relate to the 
organization, what he has to say when interested students sit on his lap definitely promotes the 
group. Instead of the usual Santa asking what you want for Christmas, the AB version, played by 
Thursday Night Film Chair Mike Gehring, said, And what do you want to do for AB?
Overall, the Activities fair ran smoothly and drew students of all ages and interests. 
Especially due to the fact that Rusted Root would be performing shortly afterwards, it 
seemed that CFAs lawn was filled with anticipation and excitement. Of course, the Activities 
Fair is in no way the only way to get involved on campus; most groups are still holding events 
and recruiting new members. So, go ahead and show up to a meeting or two - you never 
know what might happen.Adam Berson, a senior electrical and computer engineering major and operations manager for EMS and Elana Friedland, a firstyear student in H&SS, participated in the Student Activities Fair this past Friday.

ONE YEAR AGO, September 13, 1999  Student Senate decided 
to allow the Student Body President, Student Body Treasurer, and 
Senate chair to purchase parking permits using money from the stu
dent activities fee. The decision was made to make it easier for these 
student leaders to bring over supplies and go to various meetings on 
campus.
A number of students, however, felt uncomfortable with the timing 
of the decision and the idea of compensating these leaders in this 
way. Students also expressed concern that one of the student leaders 
involved was given preferential treatment since he would not have 
been able to get a parking spot withput administrative intervention. 
Michael Murphy, dean of Student Affairs, said that student leaders 
spend a lot of time working for the students and they deserved to have 
their jobs made a bit easier.
FIVE YEARS AGO, September 11, 1995  Construction of the 
new $47 million University Center was progressing ahead of sched
ule. The 240,000 square foot building was to contain all of the ser
vices in Skibo as well as the Student Center. The buildings basement 
would contain 40,000 square feet of unfinished space, set aside for 
future use.
In addition to the University Center, the University was also con
structing Roberts Hall behind Hamerschlag Hall and the new fine arts 
center. There were also plans to renovate and add to Doherty Hall. 
University architects planned to reevaluate some outdoor space to
complement the Cut.
TEN YEARS AGO, September 10, 1990  Social and Decision 
Sciences administrators decided to close the Porter Hall 217 comput
er cluster due to rising costs. This action alarmed many Information 
and Decision Systems majors, who were the primary users of the 
space. These students were concerned because the computers would 
be moved to other clusters, which had different hours and availabili
ty. These students also complained that the decision was misin
formed since summer statistics were used as an indicator of usage, 
but no information systems classes are offered at all during the 
summer.
Gary Aulfinger, cluster services manager at Academic Computing 
and Instructional Technology, defended the decision saying that 
usage statistics were relative to the previous summer and relative 
spring statistics were used as well. He also said that even though it 
was a small cluster, it cost just as much to staff and maintain as some 
of the larger clusters.
Information and decision systems students said that breaking up 
the cluster also broke up group unity. The argued that even if the 
computers were going to be removed, the space should be used as a 
team meeting area or student lounge, with the hope that this way the 
space could be used more effectively.
25 YEARS AGO, September 16,1975  New Student Senate Chair
Larry Kurzweil stated that a main goal of his was to conduct an inten
sive study into the club situation on campus. He said that clubs have 
not devoted enough time, energy, and money into recruiting fresh
men for their organizations at the Activities Fair. Some organization 
even chose not to be represented at the event under any circum

Kurzweil also said that he wanted to integrate student government 
and the student body better in CMUs campus. He said that he wished 
to focus on the work of committees and would publicize both Senate 
and these committee meetings to the campus. Although only senators 
could vote, the meetings were open to the entire student body.
50 YEARS AGO, September 4, 1950  Approximately 3,000 stu
dents were expected to enroll during registration. This number was 
down about 200 from the previous year, but higher than the pre-war 
high of 2,400. Between 175 and 190 freshmen would enter Fine Arts, 
325 would enter Engineering and Science, and 130 would enter 
Margaret Morrison. Although there was a housing shortage, male 
freshmen would have guaranteed housing and there were ample 
accommodations for women in the newly remodeled Morewood 
Gardens. The number of veterans was down to 10 percent, compared 
to the previous years 30 percent.

Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center 
gets $45 million grant for super comp
Courtesy PSC
An artist's rendition of the system by PSC graphics specialist Greg Foss illustrates a side view of the proposed terascale system to be built in the machine room at Westinghouse Energy Center in Monroeville. It will feature 2,728 
Alpha processors from Compaq. The peak performance is expected to reach 6 trillion operations per second.
by Cindy Kos.Staff Writer
 In a years time, the Pittsburgh 
' Supercomputing Center (PSC), in 
i cooperation with Compaq 
j Computer Corporation, will have 
I developed the most powerful 
I supercomputer in the world availj able for public research. Funded by 
j a $45 million dollar award received 
; August 3rd from the National 
; Science Foundation (NSF), the
* supercomputer will have computational capacity beyond a teraflop,
* a trillion floating point operations 
>per second.
 Receiving the grant to build the 
[ worlds most powerful non-military 
computer for public use is of huge 
. significance for the PSC and CMU, 
. said Jared Cohon, president of the 
. University. It reinforces our pre; eminent position in computing and 
! the outstanding reputation of the 
! PSC, and it will support the 
I Universitys future efforts in com\ puting-intensive research in engineering, biotechnology, computer 
; science and the social sciences.
\ While several terascale systems 
J with this power already exist, their 
J use is limited to classified research 
in governmental and military labo) ratories; however, the PSC system 
[ scheduled to be in full operation by 
| next fall will be the most powerful 
) public resource ever made available.
, The system, to be located at the 
) Westinghouse Energy Center in 
J Monroeville, will be used in chemi
cal, biological, and engineering 
research, and will perform calcula
tions to determine .protein struc
ture, drug design, tornado predic
tion, and earthquake modeling.
The NPACI solicited on the NSF 
website a 45 million dollar award 
to whoever in the nation could 
come up with the best proposal for 
a terascale system, said Michael 
Schneider, senior science writer for 
the PSC: We decided to go for it. 
At the time, die National Partnership 
for Advanced Computational 
Infrastructure (NPACI), a subdivision 
of the NSF, had been comprised of the 
University of California at San Diego 
and the University of Illinois at UrbanaChampaign, die only two groups in die 
US widi public supercomputing capa
bility. Upon acceptance of die NSF 
award and development of the teras
cale computer, the PSCs alliance of 
Carnegie Mellon University, the 
University of Pittsburgh, and 
Westinghouse Electric Company, in 
conjunction with Compaq Computer 
Corporation, will become die newest 
and most powerful member of the 
NPACI.
We had to detail in the proposal 
exactly how the money would be 
used to develop the system, and are 
expected to spend it in a certain 
way, said Schneider, So, techni
cally speaking, its not a grant, its a 
cooperative agreement. Thirtysix million dollars of the forty-five 
million granted will pay for the 
development of the system by 
Compaq, while the remainder will 
be allotted to operational and 
maintenance costs.
Carnegie Mellon competes for 
many grants throughout the year 
and [CMU] does very well in com
peting for federal research funds. 
according to Cohon. Though we 
are relatively small, we are one of 
the most research-intensive univer
sities, as measured by the fraction 
of our total revenues that come 
from sponsored research.
Compaq and the PSC will devel
op a six teraflop network, com
prised of 682 ' Compaq 
AlphaServer, each containing four 
Compaq Alpha microprocessors.
The AlphaServer will make use 
of high bandwidth, low-latency 
interconnect technology, devel
oped through an advanced technol
ogy program of the U.S. 
Department of Energy. This fall, the 
first stage of the system will be built 
with a peak performance of 0.4 teraflops.
Several tests will be performed 
on the initial system as a sort of run 
through, and then we will work up 
to the full-scale system, said 
Schneider.
Development of the full-scale 
system draws on the talent pool of 
CMU, UPitt, and Westinghouse, 
and will bring Pittsburgh to the 
forefront of technology-based 
research. Having this sort of com
putational capacity is extremely 
exciting because it boosts the pro
file of Pittsburgh, said Schneider. 
Undoubtedly, our region will 
become the center of brain power 
for national high-tech computing.
Review Comer
by Ish Harshawat
A keyboard for personal digital assistant (PDA) 
devices is a long since overdue concept. Many people 
might have bought a Palm device figuring that they 
could do everything with it. This includes not only 
the standard to-do lists, scheduling, and address 
books, but the ability to actually take detailed notes 
and memos with ease.
How unfortunate for them when they found the 
true limitations of Graffiti, the handwriting-recognition software that comes standard with the Palm
OS.
Short notes are one thing, but writing say, this 
article, on your Palm is out of the question with 
Graffiti. For those of us looldng for a way to do some
thing a little more with our Palms, a couple of mod
els of keyboards are now around to fulfill all our 
techno-geeky desires.
The Stowaway by Targus, Inc. is unique because it 
folds up compactly so you can stuff it into your back
pack or really large cargo pants. I tested the one 
compatible with the Handspring Visor. Models are 
available for use with the Palm III, V, VII, mlOO, and 
Microsoft Pocket PCs from another company called 
Think Outside.
The Stowaway, when folded, is a little larger than 
the actual size of the Visor, and a litde bit heavier as 
well. Setting it up is fairly easy, and actually fun to 
do. If you buy one of these you can expect to dazzle 
quite a few of your friends by going through the 
assembly ritual.
The Stowaway folds out flat, and then you push in 
the sides to make it firm and usable. The Visor plugs 
in through the cradle connectors at the bottom, and 
is supported in the back by a pull-out prop stand. 
This part of the setup is the only thing that you might 
stumble with. It took me a few times to plug the 
Visor in and I still feel like Im going to break the 
darn thing every time I do it.
How does the Stowaway type? Well, I must say 
pretty well. The keyboard size and layout is compa
rable to what you might find on a laptop. If you dont 
usually use a laptop, you might have a little trouble. 
I did well with accuracy when typing for extended 
sessions.
The responsiveness is favorable if you tweak the 
settings. In order to use the Stowaway, you have to 
install a litde keyboard program on your Visor. This 
basically allows you to enable/disable the 
Stowaway, hear a clicking sound, and change the key 
repeat rate and delay. A low setting for these last two 
seemed to work best for me.
When on a table top or another hard surface the 
typing is much easier. With a little practice, typing 
on your lap is not too difficult, but since the 
Stowaway is a little flimsy without the extra support 
you wont get the best results.
The Stowaway comes with a lot of useful add-ons, 
such as a little place for your stylus so you can use it 
if you need to move your cursor around. It also 
comes with a number of shortcut keys. The most use
ful of these are the cut, paste, and copy commands. 
Perhaps a little less useful are keys to access your 
datebook, to-do list, phone book, and memo pad. I 
figure you can always just tap the shortcut keys 
already on the Visor itself.
So, what is this device useful for? Well, you might 
have noticed in the past few months that more and 
more people are using laptops to type notes in class. 
But laptops are hard to lug around with all your 
books, and they are a little bit overkill if all you want 
to do is take down lecture notes..
Imagine, instead, using your Visor/Stowaway 
combination. You unfold the Stowaway, attach the

PDA and youre off.
I attempted to type notes using the memo applica
tion that comes with Palm OS. This program isnt 
exactly what I would call versatile. I recommend 
using a program like SuperNote, which can be down
loaded on a trial basis off of the Internet. Supernote 
is useful because you can type in notes with the key
board and even draw in litde diagrams into your 
PDA with the stylus. Let me be clear, though, if you 
are in a class that uses predominantly diagrams and 
graphs I dont think I would bother with a PDA (or 
even a laptop, for that matter).
Another great feature of the Visor/Stowaway 
combo is that even when the keyboard is connected, 
the Springboard module on the Visor is still free for 
other devices. In fact, Xircom is releasing a wireless 
ethernet module later this year that should be com
patible with wireless Andrew. Imagine being able to 
send and receive email with your Visor/Stowaway 
from anywhere on campus. So much for a laptop.
For the final test of the Stowaways usefulness, I 
wrote this article on it. I used a program called 
SmartDoc, a nifty litde word processor whose true 
potential is realized with a keyboard. I really got into 
typing up this article with the Stowaway. Because 
the screen isnt that easy to see, however, I found 
myself just looking straight ahead at the wall while 
typing. Trying to squint at the Visor is not particular
ly easy. Not only is it small, but lighting is usually a 
problem. Therefore, if you want to do any kind of 
heavy duty typing, make sure you can touch type 
pretty well without looking at the screen or the key
board.
There are a couple of minor problems that I 
noticed when using the Stowaway. You wont be able 
to HotSync with your computer while the software 
says it is enabled. Also, the keyboard stopped 
responding altogether a fe of times. Usually fiddling 
with the connection and then turning the Visor off 
and on fixed the problem.
The Stowaway is a fun product. Other keyboards 
exist on the market that are probably more sturdy 
and perhaps a litde more responsive. But the com
pactness of the Stowaway itself makes it a cool gad
get to own.

Researchers Solve Pickles Pickle
A new and better way to make 
pickles has been developed by 
ARS technologists in cooperation 
with the pickle industry and 
North Carolina State University.
Improvements include a new 
strain of lactobacillus plantarum, 
the bacterium that converts the 
sugar in cucumbers to lactic acid 
and gives pickles their character
istic sour taste.
The microorganism, which 
was chemically mutated, allows 
cucumber pickling with less salt 
and is not as likely to cause soft
ening of pickles during fermenta
tion. It also permits the use of 
closed pickling tanks, which 
have been tested successfully by 
the Mount Olive Pickle Company 
in North Carolina. Heretofore, 
pickle tanks had open tops, 
requiring the addition of large 
, amounts of salt to guard against 
! contamination.
 The Agricultural Research 
; Service (ARS) also worked on 
: peanuts. Partially defatted 
; peanuts, developed by ARS for 
; people who love peanuts but 
hate the calories, posed many
- challenges for researchers. When 
the defatting process 
 was first developed, taste pan
els rated the new product no bet
ter than "okay" because some of 
the peanutty flavor was removed 
along with the oil. The peanuts
Alissa Taylor/Art Staff
also lacked the plump, succulent 
look of higher calorie nuts.
To restore flavor, researchers 
at the New Orleans chemistry lab 
first had to determine exactly 
what constituted peanut flavor 
and how much of each con
stituent was present in a full-flavored peanut. More than 200 
compounds eventually were 
identified. In time, the chemists 
developed an improved defatting 
process that kept much of the 
peanut flavor intact. They also 
succeeded in restoring the lower 
calorie peanut to its original 
shape by expanding it in steam 
before roasting.

Department of
irYdium project explores new ways to experiment
by Sara StilleNews Editor 
& Sriram GollapalliScience & Technology Editor
After realizing that many chemistry students 
drop out of science after their first year, mem
bers of the IrYdium Project, led by David Yaron, 
a CMU chemistry professor, decided to find a 
new, more exciting approach to learning chem
istry as an attempt to keep these students inter
ested in their field. Members claim that many 
students have said that current laboratory 
experiments and practices leave them feeling 
removed from what scientists actually do. The 
IrYdium teams approach to solving this issue 
has been to create a virtual chemistry lab that 
students can access over the web.
The project itself is very fun, said Jean 
Vettel, a technical writer for the project. I 
believe in the goal of the project: to create a 
medium where a student can just play with the 
chemistry to really understand the concepts. 
You cant just combine sulfuric acid and another 
chemical in the lab to just see what happens. I 
mean, Im sure you can imagine, that is just not 
a good idea. But in the virtual lab, you can.
This new tool contains all of the reagents that 
would be found in a regular first-year chemistry 
lab, but places them in a more flexible environ
ment and allows for homework assignments 
that more closely resemble the work of a real sci
entist. While the virtual laboratory wont 
replace traditional homework assignments, it 
will be able to supplement traditional tools in a 
way that presents students with more challeng
ing problem solving issues.
Students arent used to open-ended questions 
and dealing with real scientific problems, said
Yaron. This is one reason he believes this project 
will be beneficial to students. It will present 
them with more situations they may encounter 
in the real world and teach them how to deal 
with them.
The IrYdium team is also worldng to develop 
tools that will allow faculty members to create 
simulations and experiments without needing 
to be highly knowledgeable in computer pro
gramming.
An example of one of the virtual cluster simu
lations is called The Mars Project, which 
involved collaboration between chemistry stu
dents from Mexicos Monterrey Tech and 
Carnegie Mellon University. In the simulation, 
NASA scientists needed to work with Mexican 
scientists to create fuel that would launch a 
rocket to Mars. The teams completed experi
ments in the virtual lab, exchanging information 
and ideas through.email. Two of the teams suc
ceeded in virtually launching the rocket.
The IrYdium team is now developing new 
assignments for future students. Examples 
include a search for life in the solar system, 
which is in early, collaborative stages with the 
Robotics Institute, an antidote that needs to be 
created to save sick people stranded on an 
island, and a simulation involving a cocktail 
party where a guest has been poisoned.
The goal of the project is to both help students 
here at Carnegie Mellon as well as have an 
impact on scientific education across the coun
try. By helping students and faculty become 
more familiar with new tools and chemistry, the 
hope is that they will become more interested in 
the coursework.
This project is funded by grants from the 
National Science Foundation, the Howard 
Hughes Medical Institute, and a joint grant for 
Carnegie Mellon University and Brown
University. These grants, totalling over $1 mil
lion dollars in funding, have provided continual 
improvement. New features include real-time 
communication between students and the lab 
and a library of 150 solutions in the virtual lab.
The networked laboratory simulation that the 
team is worldng on allows students to combine 
hundreds of different chemical reagents in any 
way to see what happens. This database also col
lects and stores data about students and their 
activities to allow for automatic grading for 
assignments.
The new lab allows fpr new types of home
work and class work assignments. The questions 
have become more goal-oriented. They also 
design problems where students must create 
experiments. These kinds of problems have no 
paper-and-pencil approach.
They are currently working on user testing. I 
really enjoy user testing, said Vettel. We see 
how the new users will use the lab to solve prob
lems. These observations are beneficial for the 
project in terms of refining the lab, its features, 
and the labs user guide; however, diey are also 
beneficial for me since I enjoy learning how 
other people learn, how other people attempt to 
solve problems. The mind and how it works has 
always been an intriguing subject to me.
Later, students can take what they have 
learned and apply it to the laboratory. By per
forming the experiment, it helps students see 
the connection between their work and then in 
the virtual laboratory.
The flexibility of the simulation allows students 
to actually experiment, to find mistakes on their 
own and discover why certain reactions occur.
The IrYdium project began in 1997 and so far 
has involved two faculty members, two software 
engineers, ten undergraduate programmers, 
and two technical writing interns.

(U-WIRE) PHILADELPHIA - 
After two years of hand scanner 
technology trial runs in Hamilton 
College House, the University of 
Pennsylvania may soon be ready 
to install them permanently in 
residential halls, beginning with 
the Quadrangles 37th Street 
entrance.
Officials could not project when 
the hand scanners, if approved, 
would be installed.
Last years trial, which ran from 
last January through May, was the 
second at Penn for the RAPOR, 
short for Rapid Access Portal.
The first version of the hand 
portal, which debuted in 
Hamilton in 1999, did not go over 
well with students, who did not 
like the fact that they had to stand 
in a small enclosure until their 
cards and hand prints were 
accepted.
The second version, however, 
was used to open the doors only if 
the card and hand print were 
rejected.
And according to Lynn Rotoli, 
marketing manager for Housing 
and Conference Services at Penn, 
the Residential Advisory Board 
(RAB) liked the second portal sys
tem.
With modifications, they felt 
that this might possibly work at 
other locations around campus, 
Rotoli said.
Director of Security Services 
Stratis Skoufalos said that the 
Division of Public Safety submit
ted a proposal to allow the instal
lation of a RAPOR-type portal in 
the Quad.
Skoufalos predicted that if the 
University agreed to install two 
portals at the 37th Street entrance 
to the Quad, students would not 
have to wait as long to enter.
Some RAB members, however, 
did not favor the installation of a 
hand portal at the Quad entrance.
The placement of portals in 
certain existing entranceways 
would congest the areas and be 
obstacles during move-in and 
move-out for students, RAB coChair and engineering junior 
Michael Pezzicola wrote in a let
ter.
Specifically, placement of a 
portal in the entranceways of 
Upper Quad, Lower Quad, and 
Kings Court/English House would 
not be beneficial to students due 
to the need of space for move-in, 
Pezzicola added.
Skoufalos stressed that the 
hand portal would not eliminate 
the need for a human being at the 
entrance to each college house, 
but would allow the University to 
cut down on the number of securi
ty officers posted.
We could then use (extra) 
security officers in a more proac
tive way, such as patrolling the 
halls or the outside of the build
ings, Skoufalos said.
If Penn adopts the RAPOR sys
tem, it will be the first university 
to do so. The system is already 
used by IBM, American Airlines 
and certain military bases.

Rusted Root draws, pleases enormous CMU crowd
by Beth PowellAssistant Entertainment Editor
This past Friday night, one of 
Pittsburghs own, Rusted Root, 
rocked CMUs campus. Despite the 
fact that the concert was delayed 
for an hour and a half, thousands 
of people were waiting to dance, 
sing, scream, and sweat when it 
finally took off at 9:30 pm.
Before the concert, David 
Blackwood, a junior Industrial 
Design major, said, I think every
body and their mom will be there. 
He was right. Has anyone ever 
seen such a wide variety of people 
gathered in one place on campus 
before? Not only was CMUs stu
dent body well represented, but 
there were also people from the 
other colleges in the area and 
groups of students from local high 
schools. There were people in 
attendance who had never even
heard of Rusted Root, but felt they 
should be at the biggest entertain
ment event CMU has offered in 
quite some time. Sarah Dence, a 
junior chemical engineering major 
said, Rusted Root put on a good 
performance and the audience 
seemed to really enjoy the concert. 
I only knew a couple of the songs, 
but I had a great time.
The band opened with Send Me 
On My Way, which is by far their 
most popular song, and enter
tained the audience for just under 
two hours, including two encores. 
They played a wide variety of 
instruments, such as the harmoni
ca, tambourine, bongos, and 
garbage can. These were used to 
deliver an interesting collection of 
music with the percussion section 
that was a cross between African, 
Middle Eastern, and Latin 
American influences and the over
all group sound derived from such 
bands as Grateful Dead and

Wertz, had their own Lilith Fair 
moment with the performance of 
their two duets. The band ended 
the show on a high note with the
RUSTED ROOT RUSTER

performance of their other widely 
known song, Ecstasy.
Although the use of alcohol and 
drugs was widespread during the 
concert, EMS and the Carnegie 
Mellon police were out in full force 
to make sure that no one got out of 
hand or injured and that the con
cert went off without any serious 
problems. No problems, that is, 
unless you missed the initial rush 
into the orientation tent, which 
was where the performance was 
held. This was probably the biggest 
disappointment of the concert 
since the tent can only hold so 
many people and everyone else 
had to listen from the lawn sur
rounding the tent, but were not 
able to see the actual performance. 
Kelly Chanopas, a third-year archi
tecture major, said, The concert 
was pretty good, considering it 
was in the orientation tent. Or 
maybe you were one of the shorter 
people who couldnt see the band 
through the backs of all those 
taller people. Of course, there 
were lots of girls who solved that 
problem by jumping on the nearest 
guys shoulders for a few minutes, 
even if it was just to catch a 
glimpse of the stage.
CMU and the Activities Board 
have started what looks to be a 
very promising year of entertain
ment for all the students here, and 
maybe everywhere else in the 
Pittsburgh area. For all you new 
. Rusted Root fans out there, the 
band has three albums out, Cruel 
Sun, Evil Ways (a compilation of 
live tracks and contributions to 
various movie soundtracks), and 
Remember. If youd like to be able

Pearl Jam finishes their American tour leg in style
by Joanna SmileyArts & Living Editor
This past Tuesday, Pearl Jam 
completed the last stop on the first 
leg of their yearlong tour in the 
Post-Gazette Pavilion at Star Lake 
in Burgettstown, PA. Sonic Youth 
was its opening band, but due to 
an unforeseen illness, their lead 
singer could not play the sold-out 
show. You can only guess who 
ended up filling in: Pearl Jams 
Eddie Vedder.
After dealing with mind-blow
ing traffic delays, we finally 
arrived at the show at around 7:45 
pm, at which time one of my 
friends said Hey, wait a minute. 
Thats not Sonic Youth, I definitely 
hear Alive; it sounds like Eddie. 
Sure enough, he was right and 
swarms of Pearl Jam fans ran in to 
the show as fast as they possibly 
could.
So in addition to the fact that 
Eddie played for at least an extra 
hour, by the time the rest of Pearl 
Jam came on, the crowd was 
already crazy. The band covered a 
wide range of songs from early 
albums as well as some of its newer 
tracks. Black, Better Man, and 
Nothing as it Seems were among 
the well-known favorites. One of 
the newer songs they covered, 
Slay of Hand was also really 
great, and was followed by 
Elderly Woman Behind the 
Counter in a Small Town.
Towards the end of the night, 
Eddie looked out at the audience 
and requested that a certain 
woman with a white umbrella 
make her way up to the stage. 
Apparently, this woman was a 
devout Pearl Jam fan Eddie said he
had seen numerous times in at 
least a dozen different concerts. 
This lucky woman with the white 
umbrella finally made it up to the 
stage and Eddie asked her what 
song she wanted to hear, which he 
then sang for her fight then and 
there. The rest of us watched in 
awe and envy, imagining what an 
indescribable experience that 
must have been.
Pearl Jam closed out its show 
with what undeclared H&SS 
sophomore Manish Pakrashi 
referred to as the coolest ending 
to any concert ever. They played 
The Whos Teenage Wasteland. 
Then Eddie Vedder, looking some
what tired from probably an exten
sive array of touring, travelling, 
and performing, said to his fans, 
Its finally time for us all to go
home. Good night.
Overall, Pearl Jam put on an 
incredible show. They covered so 
many different songs and albums, 
you didnt know what to expect 
next, except that whatever they 
played would be amazing. 
Without a doubt, this concert was 
probably one of the top three 
shows I think Ive ever been to in 
my entire life.

movies you may have seen before..
BY ANUY FRANCIS
It has been recently brought to the attention of the proprietor of 
this column that a) the column rarely sticks to the facts about these 
movies and can occasionally be rather negative towards them, b) 
the author is not at all qualified to be a film critic, and c) something 
else that I think was even more inane than a) and b). While it is 
apparent to pretty much anyone that none of these should have any 
bearing on the column, the author nevertheless aims to please. As 
such, I will make every effort to be super-factual, super-positive, and 
not funny at all.
L Humanit
Thursday, September 14
Winner of three awards at last years Cannes film festival, 
including Best Actor (Emmanuel Schotte), Best Actress 
(Severine Caneele), and a Grand Prize of the Jury for 
writer/director Bruno Dumont, L Humanit is probably your 
best bet this semester if youre a fan of French cinema.
The story revolves around police detective Pharaon De Winter, 
(Schotte) who is called upon early in the film to investigate a 
murder so brutal that it really shakes him up. More than a police 
drama, LHumanit is a deep character study that tries to under
stand Pharaon. What are his feelings for neighbor Domino 
(Caneele)? Why does he have so little self-confidence and 
courage?
With a running time of about 150 minutes and some graphic 
scenes, this movie might scare some off, but the emotional sub
text should make it well worth it. This is the greatest movie of all 
time.
At 9 pm and midnight
In McConomy Auditorium
High Fidelity
Friday, September 15
This flick stars John Cusack, star of such 80s comedy favorites 
as Say Anything and Better off Dead, as Rob, a record store owner 
in his 30s who starts to reevaluate himself after his longtime girl
friend leaves him. Throughout the movie, Rob and the clerks in 
his store (played by Todd Louiso and Tenacious D frontman Jack 
Black) theorize about life, love, and, above all, popular music.
While Rob and his friends generally spend a good deal of time 
constructing Top 5 lists about music (like Top 5 Songs About 
Death), he sets up much of High Fidelity early on by creating a Top 
5 list of the most devastating breakups hes had. Over the course 
of the movie, Rob replays those breakups, trying to figure out 
what went wrong and why he cant have a successful relationship.
The film is based on the cult book by Nick Hornby, which I 
havent read on the grounds that it is a book, notorious for con
taining lots of words. This is the greatest movie of all time.
At 7:30 pm, 10 pm, and 12:30 am
In McConomy Auditorium
Mission: Impossible 2
Saturday, September 16
Following the tremendous success of the first M:I outing, 
writer/producer/Hollywood champ Tom Cruise stars once again 
in the more action-based sequel. Replacing Brian de Palma as the 
director with Hong Kong action legend John Woo, M:12 trades in 
a good deal of the complexity and plot twists from the first film 
for spectacular stunts.
The plot focuses on Impossible Mission Force agent Ethan 
Hunt (Cruise)s quest to recover the world supply of a genetical
ly created killer virus named Chimera. Unfortunately, terror
ists are also on the hunt for the virus (they own stock in a large 
hospital chain) and, in addition, have acquired the only known 
antidote, named Bellerophon. To help him along the way, Hunt 
enlists the help of a few assistants, including super-thief Nyah 
(Thandie Newton.)
The film was one of the biggest blockbusters of a somewhat 
slow box-office summer. This is the greatest movie of all time.
At 7:30 pm, 10 pm, and 12:30 am
In McConomy Auditorium
Howard the Duck
Sunday, September 17
This pictures title character and protagonist, Howard, is a 
unique character, since few movies feature a wisecracldng, cigarsmoking fowl from another planet touted as a new breed of 
hero. Based on the comic books by Steve Gerber, Howard the 
Duck boasts an impressive list of cast and crew, including costars 
Tim Robbins (The Shawshank Redemption) and Lea Thompson 
(.Caroline in the City) and executive producer George Lucas.
Upon his accidental trip from his home planet to 1980s 
Cleveland, Howard is taken in by local rocker Beverly 
(Thompson), who becomes Howards love interest. Of course, 
the reason Howard was brought here was to save the earth from 
alien invaders who have the power to possess men.
If youre in the mood for a campy classic, Howard the Duck is 
the place to be on Sunday. The winner of four Razzie awards in 
1987, for Worst New Star, Worst Screenplay, Worst Picture, and 
Worst Visual Effects, this is truly the greatest movie of all time!
At 7:30 pm, 10 pm, and 12:30 am

THE TARTAN  SEPTEMBER 11. 2000
Oakland hosts presidental advisor and slew of musical acts
PITTSBURGH, from page L14
If Miss Spears doesnt ring your musical 
chimes, you have plenty of awesome rock 
acts to choose from. On Monday, 
Silkworm and the Karl Hendricks 
Trio will be right here in McConomy 
Auditorium performing in a WRCT con
cert. Describing the hypnotizing sound of 
Silkworms fusion of ' 90s indie rock with 
' 80s freeform punk sounds is too daunting 
of a task. Its much easier to introduce the 
Karl Hendricks Trio, led by Pittsburghs 
singer-guitarist superstar Karl Hendricks. 
Well, even the trios indie brand of rock is ; 
hard to put into words. You will just have 
to see these bands for yourself.
If youre looking for some more rock, 
look no further than Guided by Voices. 
This truly original rock band from 
Matador Records has drawn in thousands 
of listeners with their lo-fi, catchy, 90-sec
ond songs over their 13-year history. This 
Friday, they will be at the Beehive, mark
ing their first Pittsburgh appearance in 
almost four years.
Okay, so if rock isnt your thing, one of 
the worlds premiere young violinists is 
coining to Heinz Hall to perform with the 
Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra on Friday 
and Saturday at 8 pm. Hilary Hahn, who 
sold out the concert hall last year, is open
ing the 2000-01 season and will be joined
by conductor Mariss Jansons. More infor
mation and tickets can be found at the 
Orchestras website, http://www.pittsb u rghsymphony. o rg.
Finally, the last musical act of note is this 
band called Corporate Culture, who 
will be playing at the Rosebud Caf on 
Saturday. Admittedly, theyre not as good 
as Silkworm or Guided by Voices', but with 
songs like I Meet Girls on AOL and 
Laptop Lady, they seemingly appeal to 
the students of a certain Pittsburgh univer
sity. However, the price should appeal to 
money-strapped students of all colleges 
since admission is free.
This week also offers some chances to 
listen and speak. First, you can listen t 
David Gergen, a presidential advisor to 
every President from Richard Nixon to Bill 
Clinton. This fact makes him the coolest 
executive advisor outside of Ben Stein. 
Gergen will be speaking today at 7:30 pm 
in the Carnegie Music Hall in Oakland.
And last but not least, CMU students can 
participate in an activity, that they love to 
do a lot: gripe. This Thursday, a 
University Forum will take place in the 
Adamson Wing of Baker Hall at 4:30 pm. A 
predetermined topic of high importance to 
the university will be discussed, such as 
campus food, the sign on Purnell, and the 
designated hitter rule.
Artists Sam Jacob and Charles Holland of FAT (Fashion, Architecture, and Taste) present and discuss their work at the Fifth Annual Wats:on? 
Festival Across the Arts. Their presentation takes place on Wednesday at 7 pm in the Philip Chosky Theatre, Purnell Center for the Arts.

Squirrel Hill eatery serves up tasty, non-delivery Chinese cuisine
by Lorelei Laird\Contributing Editor
The other day, I casually menjcfoned to a friend of mine that I was 
Writing a review of Sichuan House. 
My friend, who happens to be of 
^Chinese' descent,' immediately 
launched into a tirade about how 
^sichuan is actually the-Cantonese 
Spelling of szechuan, and there
fore a corrupted word and not prope'rly szechuan at all. So I asked him 
if he thought the food there was 
authentic, in his enlightened 
Chinese-American opinion. I dont 
know, he said. Ive never eaten 
there.
Authentic or otherwise, Sichuan 
House has some of the best Chinese 
food Ive tasted in Pittsburgh. 
Located on Murray Avenue (for the 
benefit of you first-years, thats the 
main drag in Squirrel Hill) across 
the'street from the Giant Eagle, its 
a delightful change from the greasy, 
warmed-over delivery fare that so 
often becomes a students only 
experience with Chinese food.
The first thing you will notice
about Sichuan House might be the 
dcor. While perhaps more dimly-lit * 
than it needs to be, the inside of the 
restaurant is interesting yet com
fortable, decorated with ornate 
Asian-looking carvings and hanging 
lamps. The dining room is quite 
large; which made it easy for them 
to accommodate our party of eight 
quickly (a nice feature for those 
times when an entire floor or stu
dent organization wants to eat at 
somewhere nicer than Eat n Park).
I was impressed that they served us 
quite promptly despite our being a 
large party, yet managed to take 
care of the three couples that came 
in at almost the same time, without 
making anyone wait longer than 
necessary.
We started our meal out with an 
order of fried dumplings and one 
vegetarian egg roll for appetizers. 
They came nicely browned, deli
ciously oily without being greasy, 
with a soy-based dipping sauce gar
nished with green onions. While I 
did not venture to taste the pork 
inside, it looked tender and pink, 
and I am assured that it was quite 
delicious. The vegetarian egg roll
was large and well-stuffed, albeit 
mostly with cabbage.
Veggie lovers will be pleased to 
know that they take their vegeta
bles seriously at Sichuan House  
in every dish, the vegetables were 
obviously fresh, tender yet crisp, 
and never drowned in sauce or 
overcooked. In particular, I direct 
broccoli lovers to the straw mush
rooms in Yushan sauce, a lighdy 
spicy pile of tender broccoli spears 
with cute little mushrooms hiding 
among them, covered in (but not 
overpowered by) a brown, garlicky 
sauce. The bean curd with black 
mushrooms also merits mention for 
its treatment of the tofu, which is so 
often deep-fried until all you can 
taste is the vegetable oil. Not here 
instead, its cut large, fried just 
enough to make the texture inter
esting, then combined with large 
black mushroom caps and a savory 
brown sauce.
In fact, they take all of their food 
seriously at this restaurant, as the 
meat dishes attest. From old stand
bys like General Tsos chicken and 
sweet and sour pork to the more 
unusual Happy Family, the meat

was adjudged to be tender, with just 
the right amount of saltiness. The 
General Tsos, sweet and garnished 
with a maraschino cherry, proved to 
be especially popular.
If your mama taught you to clean 
your plate, you will never walk 
away hungry from Sichuan House. 
The entrees, combined with the 
complementary steamed rice, are 
quite filling enough for one person, 
or even two if you have appetizers
or small appetites. I may not be able 
to judge the authenticity of Chinese 
food, but I can certainly say that 
judging from the care paid to the 
cooking and the quality of the 
ingredients, this is the gourmet side 
of Chinese cuisine. In all, Id say this 
is a nice restaurant to bring your 
parents or a date to, or to experi
ence lots of good tastes by sharing 
several dishes with a few good 
friends. If my friend with the strong
opinions about spelling can swallow 
his objections, I might even bring 
him back soon to get his opinion 
about Sichuan Houses authenticity.
Sichuan House is at 1900 Murray 
Avenue. To get there, walk up Forbes 
Avenue toward Squirrel Hill and turn 
right onto Murray, or take any 61 bus 
to the corner of Forbes and Murray, 
then walk three blocks. The restau
rant will be visible on your right.

THE TARTAN  SEPTEMBER 11, 2000
The Harder They Are The Farder They Chew
Tumor Baby, Now That's Humor Baby
by: James Kenney (email: jpkenney@andrew.cmu.edu)
All Baba lived the first 16 years of his 
life in agony, feeling a sense of lose 
he never understood. He understood 
the idea of gain, as he gained more 
weight each year, by 16 he was a righty 
fatty. His right side buldged strangely;
A slab of skin pouring under his armpit.
One day he was rushed to the hospital, 
huge cramps, a tumor was suspected. 
When the tumor was finally removed, 
doctors vomited, baby's cried, the clouds 
thundered. Instead of a tumor, a 6 month 
baby was removed from Ali's fatty side. 
Not just any baby, his twin baby brother.
"At last, I am free from my tumorous 
tomb", screamed the garbled mess.
Ali squealed with delight, he finally 
had the baby brother he had dreamt of. 
Ali lost no time in making up for lost 
time, he tossed Tumor Baby into a ziplock 
bag, and off to Disneyland they went.
They rode on roller coasters and ate 
cotton candy, Tumor Baby spent nights 
in the fridge, on top of some lettuce. 
Mickey Mouse got confused when he was 
asked to shake the hand of what seemed 
to be a bag of lasagna. Ali had finally 
found his inner child, (thanks to the 'rug')

DO PITTSBURGH!
by Greg NofiEntertainment Editor
Hopefully your course load hasnt accelerated 
to ludicrous speed yet, since theres a lot to do this 
week. If you would like more information on 
these happenings, check out the details in the 
Calendar section. Here goes:
In case youre walking around campus this 
week and you hear people yelling, 
Waaaaaaason? Waaaaaaaaason? keep in mind 
that they are not making a pathetic attempt at 
mocking a Bud commercial. Instead, they are 
talking about the biggest College of Fine Arts 
event of the year: the Wats:on? Festival of 
Arts. The spectacle runs from Tliesday through 
Thursday and features music, art, and design 
pieces that should appeal to everyone. This event 
is so big that if youre a CFA student you get some 
classes cancelled to view the exhibits. For more 
information, visit www.cmu.edu/cfa/watson.
If youre feeling a little more competitive, this 
Saturday marks the Carnegie Mellon 
Football Team Home Opener versus Bethany 
College at 7 pm in Gesling Stadium. But there is 
also the ever-intense Pittsburgh rivalry: the Pitt 
Panthers versus the Penn State Nittany 
Lions football game at Three Rivers Stadium. 
If youre not at Three Rivers or watching the game

on CBS at 3:30, you are not a true yinzer. Its that 
simple.
Does it feel like the semester is just flying by? 
Can you believe its already October? No, dude, 
Im just kidding. I just wanted to scare you by 
mentioning this weekends Oktoberfest, locat
ed at the Iron City Brewery, 3340 Liberty Avenue. 
I have no clue why the Oktoberfest is in 
September, but here youll find plenty of beer, live 
bands, beer, lederhosen, food, beer, and Dieter 
from Sprockets. But the really cool thing about 
these last two events is that if you bring your tick
et stub from the Pitt vs. Penn State game, you 
receive free admission to Oktoberfest.
Speaking of furious Pittsburgh rivalries, Penn 
State is not the only mortal enemy to the Steel 
City. And Im not talking about the Cleveland 
Browns either. Ever since the phenomenon 
known as Christina Aguilera emerged from the 
Pittsburgh suburb of Wexford, her female starlet 
archrival has not been looked so kindly upon in 
these parts, even if she is wearing that school uni
form. Nonetheless, Britney Spears will be at 
the Post-Gazette Pavillion this Friday at 7:30 pm. 
Thats early enough so all the high school kids in 
the area can get home in time to watch Mr. 
Belvedere on ABCs TGIF programming. Wait, is 
that show still on?
