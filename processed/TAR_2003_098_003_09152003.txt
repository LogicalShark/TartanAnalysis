Campus Police arrested three juve
niles Wednesday night minutes after 
they robbed Arthur Butz, masters 
electrical & computer engineering 
student, at gunpoint. A fourth sus
pect escaped and is still at large.
Butz was walking east on the 5000 
block of Fifth Avenue Wednesday 
night when four juveniles crossed the 
street and approached him. Two of 
the suspects displayed guns, took 
almost $50 in cash and the students 
watch, and the group of four fled 
towards Morewood Avenue.
Butz notified Campus Police,
advised them that he thought the 
guns used in the robbery were fake, 
and was soon put in a secure location 
in Mudge House. He told police that 
he believed the suspects were walk
ing south down Morewood Avenue. 
Police immediately notified both City 
of Pittsburgh and University of 
Pittsburgh Police of the situation.
Soon after, Campus Police spotted 
the group of four walking down the 
4900 block of Forbes Avenue. CMU 
Police Officer Pierce exited his vehi
cle and approached the suspects, at 
which time they split up in different 
directions. The female suspect was 
ordered to the ground at gunpoint 
and arrested while CMU Police 
Officer Leon Mickens gave chase to
two of the others.
Mickens was able to apprehend 
one of the two, whom he saw grab a 
gun from his waistband and toss it 
under a car in the Morewood lot. The 
officers realized that they would not 
be able to catch all four of them at 
that time, according to Mickens.
Campus Police, Pittsburgh Police, 
and University of Pittsburgh police 
began searching for the remaining 
two suspects. They did a block-byblock search, according to Officer 
Stephen Sabol of the CMU Police.
At 11:58 pm, less than a half hour 
after the robbery occurred, CMU 
Police spotted one of the suspects at 
the intersection of Craig and Fifth. 
That suspect was apprehended on
the east side of St. Pauls Cathedral. 
CMU Police noticed that the suspect 
had a great deal of twigs and grass on 
him and he told officers that he had 
run down a hillside and into the park
ing lot of nearby Central Catholic 
High School.
All three suspects, who range in 
age from 13 to 17, were first taken 
back to the CMU Police station at 
4902 Forbes for processing. Butz was 
also able to positively identify the 
three suspects in custody at that time. 
He also gave police a statement. 
Police were able to recover cash and a 
lighter from one of the suspects but 
did not recover Butzs stolen wristSee ROBBERY, page A4

Carnegie Mellons Board of 
Trustees this summer approved the 
establishment of a satellite campus 
in Doha, Qatar on a sprawling
7,000,000-square-meter complex 
called Education City.
The next step after [approval by 
the Board of Trustees] is to negoti
ate a final agreement with the Qatar 
Foundation, said University 
President Jared Cohon.
The University, still in the latter 
stages of negotiations with the orga
nization, is being contracted to 
bring its computer science and busi
ness program to the high-tech edu
cation center. CMU joins the Weill 
Cornell Medical College, which 
started providing a degree in medi
cine last year. Also up and running 
are Virginia Commonwealth 
University, which started offering 
fine arts-related degrees four years 
ago, and Texas A&M, providing 
degrees in petroleum, chemical, 
electrical, and mechanical engineer
ing programs starting this fall. The 
Foundation is building state-of-theart facilities, supported in part by 
EDI, Ltd., an American audio-visual 
communications company, and will 
employ distance education systems 
such as videoconferencing, surpass
ing those currently used in the 
United States, including an audio
visual system better than that cur
rently used at Cornell University.
The new campus may offer more 
options to students in both 
Education City and in Pittsburgh.
We expect in our planning into 
our curriculum that students regis

Staffwriter
Although classes have only just 
begun, some students are already 
preparing for next summer by par
ticipating in the Technical 
Opportunities Conference (TOC), a 
job fair that occurs every year for 
students with majors in the science 
and technology fields. The TOC is 
sponsored by the Society of Women 
Engineers (SWE) and offers compa
nies a chance to send their recruiters 
to meet with interested students, 
collect resumes, and provide infor
mation to students who are seeking 
a job or internship for the summer. 
Likewise, the TOC gives students a 
chance to test the waters of the job 
market and learn about various 
companies that are looking to hire 
students as summer interns or per
manent employees.
There will be fewer companies 
represented in the TOC this year, 
however, leaving a bitter taste in the 
mouths of those who worked hard to 
plan and coordinate the event. For 
Moha Kulkarni, a senior chemical 
engineering student who is also an 
officer of the TOC committee and a 
member of SWE, the news of com
panies dropping out of the TOC was 
disappointing, but expected.
The problems we have been 
encountering have been with com
panies not being willing to commit
in Pittsburgh. We hope also ... that 
Pittsburgh-based students will get 
the opportunity to spend some time 
in Doha, said Cohon.
Vice Provost for Education Indira 
Nair, GSIA Executive Director 
Milton Cofield, and Associate Dean 
for Undergraduate Education Peter 
Lee are all involved in planning the 
computer science and business cur
ricula that will be offered in 
Education City. At first the 
University will start small, sending 
only a few professors over to teach 
courses that the first fifteen to twen
ty-five Qatari computer science stu
dents will need to complete their 
degrees.
Subsequent years will see a steady 
increase in the number of profes
sors. The first few classes will also 
be required to minor in business 
administration, as per the computer 
science degree requirement to grad
uate with a minor, since that will be 
the only other CMU-approved pro
gram available.
We hope to have a full [computer 
science] curriculum in 10 or 20 
years, said Lee.
Lee also said that while they are 
making minor changes to the cur
riculum to accommodate the logis
tics of having limited resources, 
larger ones that may affect the valid
ity of the degree offered are being 
avoided. Cohon also stressed the ! 
importance of keeping the core cur
riculum intact in Qatar, as it is not 
possible to duplicate the entire pro
gram.
The University is taking steps to 
avoid a drain of intellectual 
resources from the Pittsburgh cam
pus while establishing programs of

because they dont have the 
resources, said Kulkarni.
Often, these necessary resources 
are purely monetary. Molly Hosier, a 
senior chemical and biomedical 
engineering student and chairper
son for the TOC, explained that 
sending a recruiter to the TOC is an 
expensive venture for most compa
nies.
If a company has only a few posi
tions open, they are not going to 
spend the money to send a recruiter 
out here. Its almost $1000 per 
[company] to participate in the 
TOC, said Hosier.
Hosier believes that the failing 
economy is the cause of the decreas
ing numbers of company partici
pants in the TOC.
Right now we have 96 companies 
signed up to come this year. Last 
year, we had 109 companies. My 
freshman year, we had over 200 
companies, so there is a huge 
decrease from then and now. Since 
the economy has gone down, com
panies are finding that they dont 
have the resources to send their 
recruiters here, said Hosier.
Arthur Yao, the Pittsburgh branch 
chief of the Bureau of Labor 
Statistics agreed with Hosier on this 
point. The Bureau was present at the 
TOC last year, but under the direc
tion of Yao, this year, they are on the 
list of companies that decided not to

At 5 pm on Thursday, September 
11, Carnegie Mellon held a tribute to 
the second anniversary of the New 
York and Washington D.C. terrorist 
attacks. An estimated crowd of 
between 400 and 500 students came 
to the candlelight vigil held at the 
fence at 9 pm that same night to hear 
each others memories and reflec
tions on the events. But while so 
many students were in attendance, 
the vast majority of the student body 
chose not to come.
Some of those who attended the 
vigil strongly expressed their feel
ings for the nearly 3000 people who 
lost their lives nearly two short years 
ago.
Its your duty as an American to 
remember the people that gave their 
lives two years ago. As an honor to 
them, you need to remember, you 
need to pay homage, because its 
right, said Tom Matta, sophomore 
in biomedical engineering and mate
rials science and engineering.
As the amount of support shown 
over the past 2 years from all man
ner of groups and people both inside 
and outside of the country, some stu
dents had reservations about the 
ceremony.
I find it much more meaningful 
to sit in my room and think about 
what happened and to pray about it 
than to stand with a bunch of people 
with candles and say that Im com
memorating the event, said Ashley 
Birt, first-year H&SS student.
Student Body President Daniel 
Gilman and Vice President Gilbert 
Dussek opened the vigil. They called 
to mind the similar gatherings after 
the first attacks and again last year 
on the first anniversary, commend
ing the student body for its unity and 
support. They then opened up the 
microphone to anybody who wished 
to share his or her thoughts.
The speakers ranged widely, from 
those whod lived in the New York 
area to foreign students who had 
been on other continents at the time 
of the attacks. One speaker was in 
Hong Kong; another had actually 
been on a mountain in Central
America and heard the news from 
villagers with radios. Most speakers 
recalled their memories of that day; 
some had been here at college and 
others were still in high school. 
Several had lost people close to 
them. One student sang a song hed 
written after the tragedy; another 
offered a prayer.
They often spoke of the unity of 
that day, of the complete lack of dis
crimination, and of a hope that the 
future will be that way. One speaker, 
obviously deeply moved, expressed 
his hope that next time, the price of
unity would not be so great. Other 
themes were the surreality of seeing 
the planes crash, realizations of how 
fragile and precious life is, and final
ly a call to live life to the fullest. 
Another speaker commented that 
though the Twin Towers are no 
longer on the skyline, New York is 
still there, and that though some 
people were gone, their memories 
would live on. As the crowd walked 
away from the hour-long ceremony, 
it was plain to see that they had been 
deeply moved by what had been 
said.
H&SS core 
curriculum 
under review
by James Tetlow
Junior Staffwriter
Incoming H&SS first-years had to 
deal with a confusing array of 
requirements for their general educa
tion. There were three common 
course requirements everyone in 
H&SS had to fulfill, eight courses 
selected from a set of six interdiscipli
nary categories also known as distrib
utional courses, and a seminar 
course. If all this seems confusing, the 
schools administration seems to 
think so too; it might all change for 
the incoming class of 2004. The cur
rent General Education Program is 
under review for change and restruc
turing, with intent to simplify the 
requirements and make them more 
accessible.
Professor of Literary and Cultural 
Studies and head of the General 
Education Review Committee, 
Kristina Straub, warned against set
ting expectations too high.
Nothing has been set in stone, 
said Straub. She also said there would 
be several meetings during this year 
to organize and plan any eventual 
changes. The committee, which 
began discussing changes to the 
H&SS curriculum last fall, will be 
meeting on Monday for the first time 
this semester. One of the many plans 
under consideration is how to best 
receive student input. Most students 
interviewed by The Tartan were gen
erally satisfied with the general edu
cation requirements for their col
leges, but were open to new ideas or 
changes. Chris Denault, a first-year in 
CIT, said that he enjoyed the chance 
to learn about other colleges, and 
that the requirements helped stu
dents decide what major they really 
wanted to pursue. Other students, 
such as Karen Aerni, a first-year in 
H&SS, dislike the requirements 
because they make it difficult to double-major and still fulfill all the 
course requirements.
There are currently several impor
tant changes being considered for the 
H&SS general education program. 
The general education will no longer 
be organized in the current threepart structure: core, distributional, 
and freshman seminar requirements. 
Instead, students will take courses 
from among six broad categories. In 
addition, these categories will reflect 
a change in nomenclature to make 
them more recognizable to incoming 
first-years. Currently, category names 
under consideration are Humanities 
and Social Sciences, Writing and 
Interpretation, Art and Design, 
Mathematics and Computer Science, 
Natural Sciences, and Technology. 
The Technology category will focus 
on general technology (including 
robotics) as well as historical and cul
tural issues that deal with technolo
gyLarge classes such as Interpretation 
and Argument and Introduction to 
World History will still be offered. 
The freshman seminar will also con
tinue to be a requirement. The fresh
man seminar  added in 1996 
because of complaints on the lack of 
small classes and feelings of class
room isolation among first-years - is 
actually a fairly recent addition to the 
H&SS general education program, 
which was founded roughly 10 years 
ago. Academic advisor Debby

Israeli says killing 
Arafat is an option
RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP)  
Israels vice prime minister said 
killing Yasser Arafat is an option for 
Israel, as Palestinians on Sunday took 
to the streets across the West Bank 
and Gaza Strip promising to protect 
their leader.
Vice Prime Minister Ehud Olmert 
echoed threats by other Israeli offi
cials who suggested last weeks deci
sion to remove Arafat means he 
might be sent into exile, further iso
lated at his West Bank compound, or 
dealt with more harshly. But Olmert, 
considered a likely future candidate 
for Prime Minister, is the closest offi
cial to Prime Minister Ariel Sharon to 
say outright he might be killed.
Arafat can no longer be a factor in 
what happens here, he told Israel 
Radio. Expulsion is certainly one of 
the options; killing is also one of the 
options.
Palestinian legislator Saeb Erekat, 
meanwhile, condemned Olmerts 
statements as the behavior and 
actions of a mafia and not a govern
ment.
On Saturday, Arafat urged Israel to 
return to the negotiating table to end 
three years of violence in which more 
than 800 Israelis and some 2500 
Palestinians have been killed. Israeli 
leaders say Arafat is responsible at 
least indirectly for terror attacks, and 
they seek alternative Palestinian 
leaders.
Hundreds of Arafats supporters 
streamed into his devastated West 
Bank compound Sunday for a fourth 
straight day, chanting that their 74- 
year-old leader is a mountain that 
the wind cant shake. Arafat 
emerged and waved, smiling.
In an unusual gesture, Syrian 
Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa 
offered support to Arafat by tele
phone Sunday, officials said. It was 
disputed who had placed the call.
Some 5000 Palestinians in the 
Rashidiyeh refugee camp in southern 
Lebanon also demonstrated to sup
port Arafat. Speaking by telephone 
over a loudspeaker, Arafat told them: 
I will die in Palestine and I will not 
leave.
At the weekly Israeli Cabinet meet
ing in Jerusalem, Defense Minister 
Shaul Mofaz laid down a list of 
demands from any new Palestinian 
government, according to a senior 
official who briefed reporters.
Mofaz was quoted as saying Israel
Schwarzenegger: 
Republicans unite
LOS ANGELES (AP)  A little 
more than three weeks before 
Californias recall election, 
Republicans remain torn between 
two candidates, with party leaders 
continuing to fret that the division 
could cost them a chance to take back 
the Golden State.
Arnold Schwarzenegger, address
ing the need for party unity at 
Saturdays California Republican 
Party convention, called on the party 
to rally behind him as the best 
replacement for Democratic 
Governor Gray Davis.
Although his speech did not men
tion the name of fellow Republican 
and challenger Tom McClintock, 
Schwarzenegger made it clear he 
does not believe there is room 
enough left in the race for both candi
dates.
We as Republicans have a choice 
to make: Are we going to be united or 
are we going to be divided? Are we 
going to win in unity with our com
mon fiscal conservative principles or 
let the liberals win because we are 
split? Schwarzenegger asked. I say, 
let us unite for victory.
With the race to replace Davis if the 
recall is successful shaping into a 
three-way battle between
McClintock, Schwarzenegger and 
Democratic Lt. Gov. Cruz
Bustamante, GOP leaders have 
expressed concern that a divided 
Republican vote will hand the elec
tion to Bustamante.
I Tom McSelfish  divided we 
lose, read a sign carried by one con
ventioneer at the LAX Marriott over 
the weekend.
While the Republicans remained 
divided, the Democratic party 
seemed to be coming together, calling 
on party members to vote against 
recalling Davis but to also cast their
will not cooperate with any govern
ment that carries out Arafats orders 
or that strengthens his standing, and 
that any Palestinian government 
must act against militant groups and 
unite all forces under the authority of 
a single person  not Arafat.
There will be no progress without 
the Palestinians fighting terror. If 
they dont, we will, Mofaz said, 
adding that Israel will not accept the 
promises of a new ceasefire by mili
tant groups.
A two-month ceasefire declared by 
militant groups collapsed last month 
following a suicide bombing that 
killed 23 people on a Jerusalem bus, 
prompting Israeli strikes against lead
ers of the militant group Hamas, 
which claimed responsibility.
Israels leaders blame Arafat for 
preventing a crackdown against the 
militant groups, and on Thursday its 
security cabinet decided to remove 
him. Immediate action was put off, 
but the result was an onslaught of 
international condemnation.
Typhoon Maemi 
hits South Korea
SEOUL, South Korea (AP)  
Soldiers were deployed Sunday to 
search for missing people, repair 
roads, and distribute relief supplies 
after South Koreas most powerful 
typhoon on record battered the coun
try and killed at least 84 people.
At least 25 people were still missing 
after Typhoon Maemi mauled the 
southeastern coast Friday night and 
early Saturday. The Yonhap news 
agency said the death toll could 
exceed 120 as casualty reports arrive 
from isolated areas.
Packing record winds of 135 mph, 
the typhoon lifted shipping contain
ers in the air, toppled gigantic cranes 
and flipped an evacuated cruise ship 
on its side in Busan, South Koreas 
second-largest city and the worst-hit 
urban area.
On Sunday, the government 
released $1.2 billion for relief and

East Coast readies 
for coming storm
MIAMI (AP)  Hurricane Isabel 
churned in the Atlantic as a Category 
5 storm early Sunday, still several 
days from land but on a course unpre
dictable enough to worry residents 
along a long stretch of the East Coast.
Its looking more and more likely 
that this is going to be a big event for 
the eastern United States, National 
Hurricane Center meteorologist Eric 
Blake said Sunday. But its so far out 
that you cant really pinpoint it.
At 5 am EDT, Isabel had maximum 
sustained winds of 160 mph and was 
centered about 340 miles northnortheast of San Juan, Puerto Rico, 
moving in a west-northwest direction 
at 13 mph.
Forecasters computer models pre
dicted it would continue on that path 
into Monday, then turn toward the 
Carolinas, possibly making landfall 
Thursday or Friday somewhere in the 
Mid-Atlantic region.
However, forecasters note that hur
ricanes can be unpredictable, and 
long-range forecasts have large possi
bilities for error.
Still, some East Coast residents 
were preparing for the worst.
Even with plywood at its highest 
prices in a decade, Steve Myers had a

than a $300 window, Myers said.

Rutgers unveils 
Sept. 11 archives
NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. (UWIRE)  What began as a Rutgers 
University professors newspaper 
collection that was stored in his attic 
has developed into a commemora
tive display of resilience, resolve, 
and recovery during the two years 
following the September 11 attacks.
About 50 people attended the 
unveiling of the latest addition to 
The Triumphs and Tragedies of 
Humankind collection Thursday 
with a panel depicting the coverage 
of the events of September 11 at the 
School of Communication 
Information and Library Studies 
(SCILS) building on the College 
Avenue campus.
The complete collection consists 
of a group of archives displaying 
front-page newspaper headlines, 
photographs and articles presenting 
events throughout U.S. history. The 
panel depicting the coverage of the 
September 11 attacks was the sec
ond phase to this collection, which 
displayed images such as President 
George W. Bushs visits to the site, 
the Rev. Michael Judge being car
ried away by firefighters, and a can
dlelight vigil.
The real focus is the human 
tragedy, said Kevin Kelly, a member 
of the SCILS Alumni Association 
who helped design the panel.

panel had to be done carefully, Kelly 
said. He started by contacting Todd

the association  who is the origi
nal owner of the clippings used in 
the first phase of the panels.
We humans have a sense that it is

moments in history when the course 
of the world is changed, Hunt said.

of mass media courses at Rutgers, I

Harvard study as part of a national 
audio conference to be held in 
Boston.
Henry Weschlser, director of col
lege alcohol studies at the Harvard 
School of Public Health, conducted 
the national study on the effective
ness of social norm campaigns at 
colleges and universities.
According to Student Health offi
cials, the social norms program, ini
tiated in 1999, is an effort to 
decrease students misconceptions 
concerning how many of their peers 
engage in activities such as drinking 
and drug use.
Turner said Weschlsers study of 
the programs was flawed.
I think [the Harvard study] is 
wrong, Turner said. The study 
does not take into account time or 
consequence of drinking.
Jennifer Baurle of Student 
Healths Office of Health Promotion 
said the Harvard study surveyed 
120 schools and reported a response 
rate of effectiveness between 22 
percent and 86 percent.
According to Turner, the Harvard 
study failed to assess the quality of 
social norms programs, asking only 
if schools had social norms pro
grams and if so, for how long. He 
also said the sample size was too 
small for precise results.
Turner said the Harvard study 
used an inappropriate index for 
measuring drinking, defining binge 
drinking as five drinks for a male 
and four drinks for a female at any 
given social event.
The problem with this index is 
that the binge drinking bar is too 
low, Turner said. Some students 
are not even intoxicated at that 
point.
AK Steel sued for 
racial harassment
PITTSBURGH (AP)  AK Steel 
Corp. officials and union leaders at 
the companys Butler plant are 
promising zero tolerance for intoler
ance in the wake of a federal lawsuit 
that says black employees were intim
idated by racist language, nooses, 
and Ku Klux Klan videos in various 
areas, including the employee 
lounge. The U.S. Equal Employment 
Opportunity Commission (EEOC) 
said in a lawsuit filed Monday that 
the problems were so bad over the 
past three years that AK Steel man
agement had to have known of them 
even before black employees at the 
plant complained to EEOC.
AK Steels policy requires that any
one with knowledge of harassment 
must immediately report the matter 
to specific management personnel in 
the company who have been trained 
to deal with workplace harassment 
issues, McCoy said. That policy has 
been mailed to employees homes, 
posted in the plant, and addressed at 
employee meetings, he said.
The United Steelworkers of 
Americas plant local didnt deny the 
harassment occurred, but con
demned it.
If our plant is an accurate reflec
tion of society, there may well be a 
few at this facility, whether [union] 
members, contractors, supervisors, 
or managers, who have engaged in 
despicable acts of bigotry, local pres
ident Jim Gallagher said.
The deplorable acts of a very few 
should not be allowed to tarnish the 
names and reputations of the lawabiding many, Gallagher said. We 
will not tolerate discrimination by 
anyone, against anyone, for any rea
son.
City not liable for 
police accident
PITTSBURGH (AP)  The city is 
not liable for a police training episode 
that caused a neighborhood to be 
inundated with pepper spray.
The police SWAT unit was using 
the noxious spray while training in a 
house in 1997 when some of it leaked 
outside. Forty-eight people  both 
adults and children  sued four years 
later, saying the police were deliber
ately indifferent to their health and 
safety.
U.S. District Court Judge William 
L. Standish on Friday granted sum
mary judgment to the city, meaning 
the lawsuit is over unless the plain
tiffs successfully appeal his ruling.
Standish ruled that the release of 
the spray was a a single, regrettable 
incident that did not prove the pat
tern of disregard for the neighbors 
that the lawsuit alleged. The plain
tiffs had claimed police often sched
uled training exercises in predomi
nantly black neighborhoods, but the 
judge said the group presented no 
evidence to back up that claim.
Police chief Robert McNeilly has 
said he reprimanded those in charge 
of the exercise for not being more 
careful with the spray because some
body left a window open in the 
house, allowing the fumes to escape.

Protestor rolls nut 
7 miles with nose
LONDON (AP)  A protester 
rolled a nut to Prime Minister Tony 
Blairs doorstep with his nose on 
Friday, completing a 7-mile jour
ney across London aimed at high
lighting the issue of student debt.
Mark McGowan, 37, crawled on 
his hands and knees for 11 days as 
he pushed the nut from 
Goldsmiths College in southeast 
London to Downing Street using 
his nose.
I wanted to do something that 
was particularly difficult, so I think 
Ive proved the point there, said 
McGowan, who wore a bandage on 
the tip of his nose. He had spent 
eight hours a day since Sept. 1 
pushing the nut through the capi
tal.
McGowan gave the nut to a 
member of Blairs office with a let
ter asking the prime minister to 
accept it as payment for his 15,000 
pounds (US $24,000) of student 
debt. He plans to start a masters 
degree in art history at Goldsmiths 
College in October.
Ive got a sore nose, but hope
fully Ive paid it [the debt] off, 
McGowan told Sky News. I hand
ed the nut in.... At least Ive made 
my point and I think thats impor
tant.
McGowan is a veteran of unusu
al protests. He once rolled himself 
across London for 4 1/2 miles 
singing We Wish You a Merry 
Christmas to highlight the work of
office cleaners. On another occa
sion he walked for 11 miles around 
south and central London with a 
turkey strapped to his head in a bid 
to persuade people to eat less and 
cut obesity rates.
Madonna writes 
childrens book
NEW YORK (AP)  One of the 
biggest boldface names in the 
world is getting a simple, under
stated byline in an unlikely place 
 a childrens book.
Madonnas The English Roses is 
being released in 100 countries 
Monday. The initial print run of 
The English Roses is more than 
750,000 copies in the United 
States, according to publisher 
Callaway Editions.
The publisher would not release 
early review copies, nor did guests 
at Sundays launch party in 
London get finished books. But by 
Sunday, early buzz had already 
made the book No. 26 on 
Amazon.corns sales list.
The English Roses, which is being 
printed in 30 languages including 
Bulgarian, Taiwanese and 
Portuguese, is about a friendship 
shared by four 11-year-old girls 
and their mutual envy of a beauti
ful classmate. Madonna said she 
drew on her own experiences 
growing up in Bay City, Mich.
The English Roses, with pictures 
by fashion artist Jeffrey Fulvimari, 
is the first of five books Madonna 
has written. The second, Mr. 
Peabodys Apples, will be out in 
November. Each book is set in a 
different time and place.

Legislation could 
limit spam e-mail
PITTSBURGH (U-WIRE)  From 
students to politicians, almost 
everyone with an e-mail account is 
affected by spam. E-mail spam has 
united the political right and left, to 
the point where there are nearly a 
dozen bills before Congress that 
could curtail this problem.
The large number of unsolicited 
e-mails received this year by busi
nesses could end up costing $10 bil
lion, according to CBS.
Aside from the economic prob
lem, created when a business email quota is filled by spam and thus 
becomes disabled, there is the 
moral agenda behind the political 
crackdown on spam.
Children are the concern. Fortyseven percent of all spam contains 
pornographic material, and 21 per
cent of children with e-mail access 
have been exposed to the porno
graphic images found in spam, 
according to a report and recent sur
vey by Symantec, an antivirus soft
ware company.
A recent anti-spam bill, supported 
by Sen. Lindsay Graham, (R-S.C.), 
and Sen. Charles Schumer, (DN.Y.), would create a national do 
not spam list that would work 
much like the national do not call 
list that was passed last year.
When will a bill on spam be 
passed?
"Probably not anytime soon," 
according to Professor George H. 
Pike, who specializes in Internet law 
at the University of Pittsburgh.
"Free speech is at the heart of the 
issue," Pike said, explaining that any 
regulation concerning the first 
amendment, which addresses free 
speech, "takes time."
Magnetic transit 
system considered
PITTSBURGH (U-WIRE)  
University of Pittsburgh students, 
faculty and staff members fill 
Oakland in the morning, waiting for 
buses and shuttles, searching for 
parking spaces or trudging to class 
on foot.
But at California University of 
Pennsylvania in southwestern
Pennsylvania, school officials hope 
students will be able to hop on a con
venient, magnetically-propelled train 
system. With frequently scheduled 
stops, the system would let students 
commute from one end of campus to 
the other in a couple of minutes.
Urban Maglev is a train-like sys
tem, where cars ride in near silence, 
inches above a raised guideway, or 
track.
Unlike its faster (300 mph), heavier 
(120 tons), and much more expen
sive technological cousin High-Speed 
Maglev, which was created in 
Germany in the 1980s, Urban Maglev 
technology was conceived and built 
entirely in the United States in the 
last decade.
Comparing the two technologies 
would be like comparing a taxi cab to 
an airplane, Urban Maglev Group 
Marketing Strategist Stan OLoughlin 
said. One goes 50 miles per hour and 
is optimum for short distances. The 
other goes 300 miles per hour and is 
meant for much longer distances.
U.S. Congressman, and Pitt alum
nus, Jack Murtha (D-12th district) 
has championed southwestern 
Pennsylvanias involvement with 
Urban Maglev.
Murtha led the political effort to 
secure federal funding for local Urban 
Maglev development and construc
tion, recently submitting a request for 
$5 million from next years budget to 
use toward completing the $188 mil
lion California University demonstra
tion system. Murtha said Urban 
Maglev would aid transportation and 
help the local economy by easing 
commutes and creating 300 to 400 
high-paying manufacturing jobs 
building Maglev parts.
General Atomics, in San Diego, 
Calif., created the modified system, 
which would be constructed through 
a joint venture by a number of local 
companies, including Hall Industries 
Inc., in Butler County, Union Switch 
& Signal Inc., PJ Dick Inc., and 
Sargent Electric Company.
Supporters of the technology are 
counting on a few other financial 
advantages to sell it to cities like 
Pittsburgh. Operating the system 
entirely above city streets, on a raised 
track, would sidestep expensive 
insurance costs that light rail systems, 
traveling at the same level as city 
street traffic, have to pay.
Building and extending these sys
tems becomes extremely expensive 
 tunneling costs as much as three 
times the amount as building at street 
level, or grade. Urban Maglev, which 
is completely above-grade, would not 
bring such high costs.

CMU student hit 
by car on campus
A female Carnegie Mellon student 
was hit by a green sedan while stand
ing on the sidewalk in front of 
Hamburg Hall this past Friday. The 
student was waiting to cross the 
street when a white car switched 
lanes in front of a green car. The 
green car was speeding and swerved 
onto the sidewalk to avoid hitting the 
white car. It went between a traffic 
pole and the curb and stuck the stu
dent, throwing her onto the ground.
Sergeant Rich Sima of Carnegie 
Mellon Campus Police was the first to 
reach the accident. The victim was 
bleeding from the head but conscious 
and alert after the accident, he said. 
She was treated by Emergency 
Medical Services and transported to a 
local hospital.
Sima and Officer Barry of the 
Pittsburgh Police responded to the 
accident. Barry was surprised that 
the student was hit while on the side
walk. I thought she wouldve been 
crossing the street against the lights, 
he said. Most of the time students 
are distracted by their cell phones. 
Barry expressed concern that stu
dents are not aware jaywalking is 
dangerous and a crime in the 
Pittsburgh area. Students should 
remember that every time they walk 
against the lights, its jaywalking, he 
said.
Web-based course 
technology shared
Technology created at Carnegie 
Mellon is being used as a platform for 
the development of a new online 
Web-based curriculum at Centenary 
College in Hackettstown, New Jersey. 
The system created there could serve 
as an example for other colleges and
universities that are interestedTin 
putting their courses online.
CMUs Open Learning Initiative 
(OLI) is a project created by faculty 
and staff here that aims to put a 
group of courses on the Internet. The 
work at Centenary College is based 
on one of the OLI classes.
The creation of four OLI courses  
causal reasoning, statistics, econom
ics, and logic  was funded by a $1.9 
million William and Flora Hewlett 
Foundation grant. The courses ate 
only at an introductory level, but they 
serve as an example of Web-ba^ed 
courses for other groups looking to 
build a full online curriculum. >
The first courses to go online as 
part of Centenarys adaptation qf fhe 
OLI system will be from their business 
department. These courses 'We 
expected to become available ohiiiie 
this fall. The college also plans' to 
modify the OLI system to change 
courses to be taught partially online 
and partially in the classroom. 
Centenary is considering using the 
online courses to replace early math
ematics courses for their students'.
One of these courses is the statistics 
course developed by Richard 
Scheines, associate professor of phi
losophy and human-computer inter
action at CMU. He has spent ;five 
years attempting to develop a statisti
cal reasoning course that changes the 
way students think about social sci
ence research. The course is one of 
the Web-based OLI courses.' It 
includes interactive features like a 
causality lab where students partic
ipate in a simulation of a data-colfecting process in which they try tb 
defend or disprove a hypothesis 
based on their data.
We look forward to collaborating 
with Carnegie Mellon on this project 
The benefits of implementing such ~a 
program, which will allow us to incbrporate the worlds best methods in 
our teaching processes, are enormous 
for our students, said D6bra 
Fleming, vice president for learning, 
assessment, and technology and pro
fessor of accounting at Centenary!

H&SS committee reviews 
core curriculum scheme
CORE, from page A1
Gerhardt described the state of gen
eral education before the modern 
curriculum existed, [The core cur
riculum was] much more pro
scribed, much more restricted. Gen. 
Ed. has distributional requirements 
to allow more flexibility.
. Straub had similar sentiments 
about the current system.
I It was done for good intellectual 
reasons, but replacing [distribution
al requirements] with something 
more accessible makes sense, she 
said. The current system was creat
ed as a two-year program. However, 
while most H&SS students complete 
their requirements within two 
years, the same is not always true 
for other colleges. One possible shift 
being considered is that the new 
general education program might 
be spread across four years instead 
of two. This would probably include 
a higher emphasis on courses in the 
300-400 levels.
Possibly the most important pro
posal under consideration is a plan 
for a university-wide general educa
tion program suggested by professor 
Wilfried Sieg, head of the 
Philosophy Department. His major 
concern is not restructuring the cur
rent H&SS general education, but
instead unifying the core program 
for all undergraduates at CMU. With 
the exception of the CFA, there is a 
remarkable consistency of general 
education requirements among col
leges, so such a change would be 
possible and allow for more unity in 
education. Sieg is optimistic about 
his proposal; saying he believes it 
could be instituted as soon as this 
semester. Straub said, however, 
This would not be a top-down 
order to the colleges ... the autono
my of every college will be main
tained. Nobody will legislate to CIT 
or any other college what their pro
gram should be.
Asked what she would like imple
mented that is not being planned, 
Straub said, Dare to dream of a uni
versity where every student had a 
class like the freshman seminar. I 
would like to see every freshman 
who enters this university have the 
supportive framework of a small 
class with an instructor the students 
can get to know that would make 
the transition from high school to 
college easier.
As Sieg said about the idea, 
which, due to budget reasons, is 
unlikely to be instituted in 2004, I 
hope it will be a dramatic improve
ment, yet quiet in the spirit of our 
educational enterprise....
Three robbery suspects 
caught, one fled on foot
ROBBERY, from page A1
watch. Police also recovered the 
un that had been thrown under a 
car in the Morewood lot by one of 
che suspects. The gun, described as 
a* '9mm with a 6 barrel, a 
tractable slide, and a black grip, 
was determined to be a toy.
On a scale of 1-10 looking real, it 
was a 9 and 1/2, according to 
i-abol.
Although the second weapon has 
not been recovered, it is believed 
that the suspect still at large is the 
other one that used a gun in the rob,bery. Campus Police are confident 
that it is also a fake weapon.
Theyre both plastic. I havent 
seen the second weapon  but I 
know its plastic, said Mickens.
This recent robbery brings cam
pus and campus area crime to stu
dent attention yet again.
First-year student Jackie Xu said 
that she usually thinks of the cam
pus as a quiet and peaceful place at 
night, but that she is still cautious.
I come from a big city so I dont 
walk alone at night. I use Safe Walk, 
she said.
Mickens said that this recent case 
was simply a crime of opportunity 
and that the suspects simply needed 
the money.
I dont think they were doing it to 
hurt anyone, he said.
He also used the situation as an 
opportunity to remind students of 
precautions they should take. I still 
think [the campus is safe]; the stu
dents need to utilize the 
shuttle/escort services.
The three suspects were trans
ported to the Municipal courts 
building for fingerprinting and pho
tographs and then later taken to 
Shuman Detention Center.
CIT/MBA program accepts 
inaugural class of undergrads
by Kevin Chang
Junior Staffwriter
Two students now comprise the 
first class of the Carnegie Mellon 
Integrated Engineering & Business 
Program, a joint venture of CIT and 
the GSIA that awards a BS/MBA in 
five years. The program was designed 
to make it easy for engineers interest
ed in business to learn about both dis
ciplines.
There are a number of integrated 
masters programs within CIT, said 
Robert Kail, associate dean for under
graduate studies. I just see it as 
another option for students.
John Mather, executive director of 
MBA programs, was one of the major 
proponents of the program since its 
conception.
We wanted to give the opportuni
ty to those who wanted it, he said.
The CIT/GSIA program starts the 
same as any CIT program. Students 
take a normal schedule of engineer
ing courses for the first three years, 
possibly moving up a few junioror 
senior-level courses where possible.
Students are expected to be taking 
engineering courses in the fourth and 
fifth years, said James Garrett, asso
ciate dean for academic affairs. 
Business courses are also scheduled 
for those two years, and the schedule 
fits because many electives count for 
both degree requirements.
According to Kail, many engineer
ing students eventually return to 
school to get business degrees.
We recognized that this was not 
an unusual path for engineers to 
take, he said. Business schools love 
to have engineers.
Kail said that engineers are the sec
ond-most common group of students 
in MBA programs, after business stu
dents, partly because of their compu
tational skills. SCS and other colleges 
now have similar five-year programs, 
though only CIT and SCS have offi
cial protocols specifying require
ments and tracks. A total of seven stu
dents are currently enrolled in inte
grated MBA programs.
A few business students com
plained about the program last year, 
claiming that working with students 
with no real-world experience would 
devalue the degree. However, neither 
Kail nor Mather heard any com
plaints, and Kail said there was no 
groundswell of opposition.
The courses are identical to the 
ones a student coming in from out
side would take, said Kail. We have
every reason to believe that engineer
ing students will bring good skills to 
the table.
Mather said that most business 
schools have recently stopped requir
ing experience as an admission criteri
on, and that the practice of asking for 
experience only began in the 1970s.
[Having students with no experi
ence] is diversity, he said. Not 
everyone will be 28 anymore.
Though there are only two stu
dents in the program this year, 
Mather predicted good results for the 
future.
Our goal is to have a small but 
steady number of students take 
advantage of this program. The 
CIT/MBA program now gives CIT stu
dents another way to integrate their 
engineering interests in a specific dis
cipline and their business interests. In 
five years, these students can get a BS 
in engineering and an MBA, said 
Garrett.
The protocol for the program was 
finalized late last year, so prospective 
applicants began the application 
process about five months late and 
had little time to think about it, 
according to Kail.
One of the problems we had last 
year was that we approved the pro
gram and announced it to students 
very late.... it didnt give students 
much time, he said.
The Director of Admissions and the 
Career Center will hold an orienta
tion for the CIT/GSIA program from 
4:30 to 5:30 on October 8 in Scaife 
Hall 125. The orientation will be 
aimed at sophomores and juniors 
who are considering entering the 
program.
ATTENDANCE, from page A1
accept the invitation to come this 
year.
This year, I was the decision
maker, and because of the bad econ
omy, I did not feel that it was fair for 
us to go with no job positions and 
just go to be a presence at the TOC, 
said Yao. Also, because [CMU] is 
highly ranked, the chance of your 
people going to a federal organiza
tion like ours is zero to none. So we 
are not a good match.
Thus, it was the trend of the stu
dents that prompted Yao to decline 
the invitation to the TOC this year. 
Suzanne Mooring, the university 
j relations account manager for Apple
Computer, cited a similar reason for 
not attending this year.
Our focus has shifted to hiring 
interns first. They have become our 
primary source of permanent hires, 
said Mooring. Instead, Apple will be 
attending the Technical Internship 
Expo in the spring.
The changing market, therefore, 
has not only affected the way that 
students are approaching their job 
search, but has also affected the way 
companies hire new employees. 
Despite the difficult market, Molly 
Hosier remains optimistic about the 
TOC and the job market.
Although the numbers are 
decreasing, I feel like it can only get 
better from here, said Hosier.

Local charity holds benefit for Argentinians CMU in latter stages of Qatar campus deal
by Hannah Yi
Staffwriter
Over 180 people gathered at 
Pittsburghs Bossa Nova this past 
Sunday for a night of tango, 
Argentine wine, Spanish tapas, and 
sangria. This night of revelry, Viva 
Argentina!, was hosted by Bnai 
Zion, a Jewish humanitarian organi
zation, to help fundraise and bring 
awareness to the public about the 
current economic state of the second 
largest country in South America.
The situation in Argentina pulled 
a heartstring, said Pamela Love, the 
event coordinator and board mem
ber of Bnai Zion. Our objective is to 
inform people of whats going on 
there.
Things started looking grim for 
the Argentine population of approxi
mately 36 million in December 
2001. The country began to flounder 
in fiscal deficits and had accumulat
ed debt of $141 billion as conse
quences of heavy borrowing and an 
overvalued peso. President 
Fernando de la Rua stepped down 
later that month, and a string of five 
different presidents within the span 
of two months succeeded the resig
nation.
The real problems began after the 
government unfixed the value of the 
peso. The Argentinian peso was tied 
to the dollar, one to one, for 10 years 
in an effort to end the hyperinflation 
of the 1980s. When the government 
undermined this, people began to 
withdraw substantial amounts of 
their money. Fearful that the banks 
would fold in response, the govern
ment froze all savings accounts and 
restricted withdrawals. The peso has 
since been devalued to 2.96 pesos on 
the dollar.
The repercussions of the devalua
tion and lock on banks affected the 
entire Argentine community. The 
hardest hit was the middle working 
class. Many lost their jobs and those 
who retained them were still paid 
the same salaries.
Someone would be making 
$2000 per month but one day the 
government tells him that he cant 
touch his account. Suddenly hes 
making $800 per month, said 
Marcos Amadeo, a graduate CFA 
student and organizer of Viva 
Argentina!
With unemployment at 15 percent 
and a currency which has lost almost 
75 percent of its value, life has dras
tically changed for the once econom
ically healthiest country in Latin 
America. Cynthia Golzman, a
QATAR, from page Al
J.T. Trollman/Assist; nt Photo Editor
Tango and donations were on the menu at Bossa Nova in downtowr Pittsburgh 
as Viva Argentina! raised funds for impoverished Argentinians. Deputy Chief of 
Missions Daniel Chuburu from the Argentine embassy stands at the n icrophone.
University of Pittsburgh PhD student 
in Hispanic Linguistics and a speaker 
for the event, gave a firsthand 
account of the dire. situation the 
Argentine middle class was facing 
when she recently went to visit.
There were lots of people beg
ging on the streets and entire fami
lies picking in garbage. It was not 
easy to digest, said Golzman. It 
was also shocking to see pickpock
ets. We didnt have pick-pocketing 
two years ago and now it happens all 
the time on the bus or while shop
ping.
Many Argentineans are unable to 
adjust to the new lifestyle of poverty 
and little cash; how to survive with a 
meager income is not registering.
The transition from middle class 
to poor is difficult for the people, 
said Amadeo. Kids are dying of mal
nutrition and hunger in a country 
where the food industry is strong, 
because parents are still buying lux
uries like Coke instead of whole
some foods.
Those who were lucky avoided the 
economic and social collapse by emi
grating to Spain, Italy, or the United 
States. However, for most 
Argentineans, the money to even 
purchase a $70 passport is impossi
ble. Dan Lee, an undecided first-year 
in H&SS from Argentina, said that 
business is risky because of the eco
nomic situation.
My parents live in the U.S. but my 
dad runs a garlic business in 
Argentina. He makes monthly visits 
because business is kind of danger
ous and you cant trust what goes on
there, he said.
Despite the consequences sprout
ing from the economic 
officials say that things ^re looking 
up since last year.
Deputy Chief of Missions Daniel 
Chuburu from the Ai 
Embassy who spoke at the

nowadays.

getting better. The unenployment

the same caliber as those found at 
CMU. At first, a few volunteering pro
fessors will be chosen to spearhead 
the program and will be replaced 
with new teachers at the Pittsburgh 
campus.
There is a surprising amount of 
interest in going, said Lee, but over 
time we expect the trend to reverse 
and have more slots open than pro
fessors willing to go.
The first slot in the cadre of lectur
ers going to Qatar is reserved for SCS 
Director of Undergraduate Labs and 
Technology Jacobo Carrasquel.
He is our in-house international 
education person, said Lee.
Professors from the two programs 
will cycle in and out of Doha on a 
yearly basis, with more being sent 
each year but all eventually coming 
back to Pittsburgh.
[The new faculty] will give them 
an opportunity to build up strength 
in new research areas or research 
areas in which were not as strong, or 
undergraduate teaching areas where 
they would like to enhance the pro
gram, said Cohon.
According to Cohon, the Qatar 
Foundation will provide all funding 
for the hiring of new teachers and all 
costs incurred by the program on U.S. 
soil as well in Qatar. Cohon also said 
that the wealthy Arab nation will 
consider a separate financial gift in a 
form that has not yet been deterjree Offerings in Education City

Chuburu. We are looking for more

by donating over the coulter drugs.

mined. The source of Qatars wealth, 
according to the Central Intelligence 
Agencys World Factbook, is the 
recent discovery of oil and gas fields, 
responsible for a per capita income 
comparable to that of Western 
European countries.
The sums of money involved are 
more money than CMU has been 
offered in a long time, said Heinz 
School Provost Mark Kamlet in a 
Tartan article on February 10 of this 
year. Although the venture will pro
vide many benefits to CMU, including 
funding for projects that do not 
involve Qatar, not everyone sees eye 
to eye with the Administration. 
Robert Strauss, professor of econom
ics and public policy, takes issue with 
the Universitys partnership with the 
tiny oil-laden nation.
I suggest you call any insurance 
company you might think of to find 
out what it would cost for a professor 
to get life insurance over there while 
teaching, and what it would cost for 
[his] wife and children [especially 
daughters]. Pay particular attention 
to what are called exclusions or 
events that are not insurable. Also 
find out what life insurance would 
cost for CMU students who are 
adventurous enough to go over there 
to study business or computer sci
ence, wrote Strauss in an e-mail. 
International Health Insurance pro
vides coverage for international trav
el and residence regardless of desti
nation at rates about 20 percent high
er than the 800-plus dollars CMU 
charged students for their mandatory 
insurance. The plan includes terror
ism coverage and full coverage of 
medical evacuation to the home 
country of the insured.
Strauss also suggests examining 
the recent history of the country. In
Bum Lee/Art Editor
1995, the emir was removed from 
power in a bloodless coup led by his 
son and the current emir, Hamad bin 
Khalifa al-Thani. Since then, the emir 
has established the Qatar Foundation 
and initiated the Education City pro
ject. Students who travel and attend 
the Education City campus will have 
to consider the U.S. State 
Departments warnings of potential 
acts of terrorism against Americans 
and American interests in the region 
in addition to the fact that Qatar was 
the U.S.s military headquarters in 
the recent invasion of Iraq.
Another concern raised by Claudia 
Kirkpatrick, a senior lecturer in GSIA 
and the representative of Faculty 
Senate to the University Student 
Affairs Committee, was the possible 
disparate treatment of men and 
women in the classrooms of an Arab 
nation like Qatar. According to 
Kirkpatrick, Kamlet briefed Faculty 
Senate on the issue and said that the 
issued was resolved to the 
Universitys satisfaction.
I was not worried about it once 
they had [informed] us, said 
Kirkpatrick. She also said Nair trav
eled to Qatar to observe students in 
the programs already in place and 
came back pleased with the level of 
conversation of the female students.
CMU students in Doha will also get 
to experience some of the student 
activities that Pittsburgh students 
enjoy. To address this, Dean of 
Student Affairs Michael Murphy will 
be traveling to Qatar sometime this 
month.
Students will live on campus....

versity experiences, not just the acad
emic but the extracurricular as well, 
said Cohon.

At Tech Sunday, students networked, learned how to job search
by Teh Seng Keat
Junior Staffwriter
CMUs second iteration of its 
annual job search skills event, Tech 
Sunday, brought in students ranging 
from first-years to grad students.
Organized by the Career Center, 
this years Tech Sunday saw a variety 
of talks given by major corporations 
such as Microsoft, IBM, Lutron, 
Lockheed Martin, and LOreal.
Participants had the opportunity 
to attend talks on a variety of topics 
such as Navigating a Job Fair 
Successfully^ Internship
Searching, Interviewing Skills, 
and The Graduate Student Job 
Search.
Throughout the day, participants 
heard from company recruiters the 
skills and criteria that they look for 
in the people they hire.
At the end of the event, partici
pants were treated to an ice cream 
social, where they had the opportu
nity to interact with potential 
employers on an informal basis.
Tech Sunday is meant to give stu
dents in a technical major knowledge 
of the different aspects of the job 
search process and for them to learn 
about the skills they need directly 
from recruiters, said Kevin Collins, 
assistant director of the Career 
Center.

Award-winning professor Tuomas 
Sandholm will be giving a talk on the 
role of computer science (CS) in 
game theory titled Making Markets

Fe-TAML compounds like the one above, along with hydrogen peroxide, will clean 
up toxic pollutants. Terry Collins research group presented those results last week 
at the 226th annual meeting of the American Chemical Society in Boston.
New use for green catalysts
by Karen Hoffmann
Science and Technology Editor
Green chemist Terry Collins, direc
tor of Carnegie Mellons Institute for 
Green Oxidation Chemistry, has dis
covered yet another use for his versa
tile catalysts.
Last week in Boston at the 
American Chemical Societys annual 
meeting, Arani Chanda, a graduate 
student in Collins group, presented 
research showing that hydrogen per
oxide can completely break down a 
toxic class of widely used pesticides 
known as organophosphates.
The peroxide works when activat
ed by the catalysts developed by 
Collins group, tetra-amido macrocyclic ligands (TAML). When 
wrapped around an iron core, they
are known as Fe-TAML activators.
Collins originally developed the 
hydrogen peroxide/Fe-TAML combi

In ancient Greece! philosophers 
like Socrates and hs pupil Plato 
stood in the agora < abating ques
tions such as What s good? and 
What is just?
At the Conflict of tterest confer
ence in GSIA last veekend, the 
atmosphere of lively liscussion was 
similar, although t e agora was 
actually a conferenc room on the 
third floor of GSIA.
Co-sponsored by the Carnegie 
Bosch Institute anc the National 
Science Foundation the event 
brought psychologiss, economists, 
and philosophers, mong others, 
together to focus o a topic com
mon to almost every jrofession: the 
conflict of interest hat can arise 
when peoples biaes contradict 
their professional di y to be impar
tial.
Conflicts of inte:;st are ubiqui
tous, said DaylianCain, a GSIA 
doctoral student in organizational 
behavior and theor, who helped 
organize the confer ice.
Biases can be emc ional, as when 
white people are qu :ker to associ
ate good words wth white faces 
than with black, a presented in 
research by Dolly Cl lgh, a doctoral 
student in organiza ional behavior 
at Harvard Business school.
Biases might also >e financial.
A patient may ge a certain drug 
based on the recommendation of a 
physician whos pus ing the partic
ular drug, said Jcome Kassirer, 
former editor-in-ch if of the New 
England Journal of Vledicine, now
professor at Tufts U
of Medicine and an adjunct profes
sor at Yale Univeiity School of 
Medicine.
Even though tilt physician is
iversity School
involved with a company, hes push
ing a drug that he shouldnt push. 
One solution to such an issue is to 
disclose financial ties, such as when 
the doctor informs the patient that 
he has received funding from the 
company that makes the drug.
However, as Cain presented in a 
paper called The Dirt on Coming 
Clean: Perverse Effects of
Disclosing Conflicts of Interest 
that he co-authored with SDS pro
fessor George Loewenstein and Don 
Moore, an assistant professor of 
organizational behavior and theory 
in GSIA, such honesty, rather than 
causing the patient to take the rec
ommendation with a grain of salt 
and get a second opinion, may actu
ally cause the patient to trust the 
doctor more. 
The concept for 
this conference 
began when 
Loewenstein 
and Moore were 
visiting Max 
Bazenrian, Jesse 
Isidor Straus 
Professor of 
Business 
Administration 
at Harvard Business School.
Wed given presentations on our 
research in the accounting group at 
Harvard Business School, then in 
the psychology department, said 
Loewenstein.
Then, based on the usefulness of 
those interactions, it suddenly 
dawned on us that a full-blown con
ference on the topic could be even 
more fruitful.
We were aware of how much 
work was being done, in a variety of 
disciplines, and that made us want 
to bring everyone together to talk, 
said Moore.
Keynote speakers at the confer
ence were Lynn Turner, former
rgcimg bcgsgdulgpd
chief accountant of the Securities 
and Exchange Commission (SEC), 
and John Coffee, Berle Professor of 
Law at Columbia University.
Toward the 
end of the last 
day of the con
ference, conversation 
turned to how 
to ensure the 
research pre
sented at the 
meeting was 
used when 
Sci Tcceh making policy
decisions. A vigorous debate 
ensued.
Moore called the tone of the pre
sentations at the conference fairly 
pessimistic, but said that he 
thought it was important that pre
senters illustrate the severity of the 
conflict of interest problem with 
scary stories from a range of pro
fessions.
Im quite depressed after this 
conference, said Ann Tenbrunsel, 
associate professor in the Mendoza 
College of Business at the 
University of Notre Dame.
Not only do these conflicts exist 
in the lab, they exist in the medical 
profession, in the SEC....
The different papers at the con
ference really drove home to me the 
importance of psychology for 
understanding human behavior in 
the face of conflicts of interest, and, 
conversely, the impossibility of 
reaching such an understanding, or 
of foreseeing the effects of policies, 
armed only with economic theory 
and methods, said Loewenstein. 
He called the attendees an all-star 
cast.
With that group, you could 
probably have an interesting discus
sion about almost any topic, he 
said.

Smokers often have broken DNA 
that can lead to lung cancer.
However, not all smokers develop 
the cancer.
Researchers at the Weizmann 
Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel, 
looked for differences in the levels of 
an enzyme that repairs damaged

According to the September 3 issue 
of the Journal of the National Cancer

Garlic pesticide is 
effective, nontoxic
A new pesticide based on garlic can 
repel and eventually kill snails and 
slugs.
Gordon Port, a researcher at 
Newcastle University, reported to the 
annual conference of the British 
Association for the Advancement of 
Science that he doesnt know the 
exact method by which the pesticide 
works.
He said, however, that garlic oil 
will eventually cause the pests to cre
ate so much mucus that they dry up 
and die.
The garlic base for the pesticide 
makes it an environmentally friendly 
compound.
Port is currently working on part
nering with a private company to pro
duce the chemical for commercial 
and home use.

CMU should support its
D/ivibrant Athletics programm
j'
Disparage them if you wish, but many of 
Carnegie Mellon? sports teams rank among 
; the best in their division. Some students might 
have heard something about the excellence of 
j ,6the swimming team; some might know that 
! *9 the mens soccer team had an undefeated sea^i sdun last year and went on to the NCAA play! offs. For the most part, both teams have 
become quite accomplished with nary a peep 
or a show of support from the administration, 
j ^ For the uninformed, here are some quick facts 
! frout some of our schools most successful 
! ' tefems. We have an excellent swimming team;
: ^etie men have been ranked fourth in the nation 
in Division III for the last two years. Thats 
fourth out of all 160 of the Division III mens 
swimming teams.
1 j;i(i)iMens soccer went undefeated in their con! ference last season. They made it to the NCAA 
playoffs, though they lost to one of the best 
teams in the country in the first round. 
Womens soccer had an 11-5-2 season, was 
 C-iationally ranked, and started the new season 
6Styh three wins and a draw.
Womens volleyball went to the NCAA play
offs two years ago and ever since has contin
ued to rank nationally off and on throughout 
the season. The CMU football team, with the 
'nsekson well underway and players highly visi
ble during their afternoon practices, has had 
9^8 straight winning seasons.
Then there are the tennis, track, cross coun
try, golf, and basketball teams, each of which 
is successful in their own right. Yet the attitude 
. towards sports among students, as reflected in 
;ih attendance at most on-campus sporting 
'n! vents, seems to be: who cares about sports?
 > This is CMU.
,,;f )For shame, CMU. The members of these 
itegrns work just as hard, if not harder, than 
;-;$fly student on this campus to balance a 
kjCourseload every bit as intensive as that of any 
.. other student with dedication to their sport 
 and their team. Coaches remarked that the 
<:?fans who come out to support the teams are as 
8Kdfedicated and supportive as any that a coach 
or team could hope for, but most noted as well
that the focus at CMU is on academics, not 
athletics. It all comes back to that dogged 
CMU priority: the academic workload.
Are CMU students really so busy on their 
Saturday afternoons that they cant spare an 
hour or two to root for the home team? Could 
they be so busy that stopping by the O to pick 
up some fries couldnt also translate into a few 
cheers for the nationally-ranked swim team, 
whose practices are easily viewed from the 
nearby dining area?
The fault is not all on the students, of 
course. Take note, CMU big shots: teams at 
Emory and Washington University, schools 
that are often regarded as CMUs peer institu
tions and schools which CMU consistently 
ranks just below in a number of sports, have 
significantly more money and larger staffs for 
their athletics programs. The difference shows 
up in the national rankings.
Information concerning games and their 
outcomes is also in short supply from the 
University; the position of Sports Information 
Director was recently vacated and has yet to be 
filled, but even before the previous Director 
left, one never seemed to hear much about the 
teams, the games they played, or the out
comes.
This administration needs to take a good 
look at a little-known department that stands 
out just as much as any other on this campus. 
Fundraising efforts specifically geared 
towards the athletics department would allow 
the department to further raise the bar, and 
the addition of a good public relations staff 
would certainly help improve campus aware
ness of the teams and their games.
But dont think that gets you off the hook, 
students. You didnt come to Carnegie Mellon 
to spend your Saturday afternoons watching 
Division III sports; you came to work hard and 
graduate ahead of the rest. But that doesnt 
mean you cant, and it certainly doesnt mean 
that you shouldnt. Take a break from the 
homework for an hour or two next Saturday 
and go support one of our many successful 
athletics teams, CMU. They work hard for it.
CMU gyms need a facelift
When deciding what to include in the 
recent UC renovation project, the University 
considered the possibility of expanding its fit
ness center; but the workmen have come and 
g;gpne, and theres not a single new machine or 
barbell in sight.1 'T Though few Carnegie Mellon alumni will 
i ever qualify for a Strongman competition, 
'many students here have an active interest in 
fitness and health. For these students, main
taining a regular workout regimen is not easy; 
since installing the Weiland Gym in the 
University Center as part of the New Campus 
Plan in 1995, the University has failed to 
address the problems created by the spaces 
ever-growing popularity.
While most large colleges feature one main 
athletic center, CMUs fitness offerings are 
poorly divided between the UC fitness center 
aftd the Skibo gym. Weiland is certainly better 
maintained and more popular than the aging 
and out-of-the way Skibo gym, but its short 
hours and insufficient equipment still fall very 
Short of students fitness demands.
012-For students who like to begin their day 
with a workout and for those who cant find 
-time in their busy schedules to exercise until 
early in the morning, the UC gym is an off-limife fitness fortress. The doors are locked at 
c|pidnight, and the facilities arent available 
 ^gain until 6 am on weekdays and 10 am on 
weekends. Skibo Gym suffers from even short
er hours, closing at 10 pm on weekends. An 
increase in available gym time would help 
alleviate the current mid-afternoon rush that 
leaves many students waiting in line for car
diovascular machines and racquetball courts. 
In light of the new 24-hour gym trend, many 
establishments, such as The X in Shadyside, 
have expanded their hours to wrap around the 
clock, and the University should follow suit, 
g Theoretically, the only people in the 
University Center after hours have gained
entrance with their valid CMU IDs, and with a 
few strategically placed video cameras, securi
ty concerns should be largely dispelled. If, for 
reasons of safety and liability, the athletics 
department is still hesitant to leave students to 
exercise unattended, or if the cost of addition
al surveillance would be too great, it should at 
least reinstate its old closing time of 1 am.
The gym equipment itself is also currently 
insufficient. Though generally in fair condi
tion, there are a few elliptical machines whose 
tracks are too well worn to provide maximum 
ergonomic support, a few treadmills are bro
ken, and the trod-upon floor mats are show
ing their age. The dilapidated Skibo Gym, 
erected in 1924, is in even worse condition, 
with paint chipping off the walls and floor 
mats that are literally torn apart. Most prob
lematically, however, there are too few 
machines to accommodate all gym patrons, 
especially during peak hours; with over 7000 
CMU students and employees, the ten or so 
treadmills in the Fitness Center are simply 
inadequate. As for the rooms themselves, they 
make working out in the UC gym like being a 
hamster on its wheel; the primary exercise 
rooms are glass-paneled cages that face heavy 
traffic and S Seor diners. More private 
rooms with better ventilation would not only 
please current gym patrons, but might also 
encourage other students to adopt workout 
regimens for the first time.
The Universitys official athletics website 
states Carnegie Mellon fosters a belief that 
athletics are an integral part of student life. 
The principles of dedication, discipline, and 
teamwork are not relegated to practices and 
games. Carnegie Mellon athletes apply those 
principles in the classroom and beyond. For a 
school with such a professed interest in stu
dent health and activity, however, CMU is cer
tainly out of shape when it comes to actually 
meeting students fitness needs.

Ticketmaster auctions away morality
Michael Croland
Ticketmaster has often incurred the fury 
of artists, partially in defense of their fans, 
for exorbitant service fees. Although 
upcoming Ticketmaster auctions will coop
erate with artists, consumers will suffer 
from the unjust practice.
Ticketmaster has a virtual monopoly on 
ticketing, and gets rich from the high ser
vice charges tacked onto tickets sold for 
entertainment and sports events. Last year, 
the company sold 95 million tickets, 183 
percent of the 1993 volume.
With no legitimate competition, 
Ticketmasters new auctions challenge the 
illegitimate competition: scalpers and ille
gal brokers. Starting later this year, cus
tomers will be able to bid online for the best 
seats in the house. Ticketmaster can there
fore exploit profits far exceeding face-value, 
a role previously reserved for secondary 
markets.
Maybe that money should be coming to 
me instead of Bob the Broker, reasoned 
Ticketmaster President and CEO John 
Pleasants to The New York Times on 
September 1.
From a greedy industry perspective, the 
auctions are stupendous. Ticketmaster can 
now tap into the one major source of rev
enue thats eluded them: scalping. Industry 
insiders, such as the concert trade journal 
Pollstar, feel that customers are already dis
advantaged by a pre-established market, so 
Ticketmaster is not hurting them by adher
ing to the trend. It is even possible that less 
desirable tickets will sell for lower than 
face-value, argue proponents of the auc
tions, but such losing propositions will 
probably be infrequent. For ticket pur
chasers, Princeton economics professor 
Alan B. Kreuger foresees a troubling future. 
The auctions will reveal a tickets high mar
ket value, explained Kreuger to The Times in 
the aforementioned article, catalyzing 
prices to increase throughout the market.
Ticketmaster is exploiting basic supplyand-demand conditions, a reasonable tactic 
for a capitalist company. By doing so at the 
expense of consumers and without competi
tion from within the industry, though, the 
monopolistic mega-corporation is being 
unreasonably savage.
The auctions perturb many concertgoers 
because only the richest fans will have 
access to the best seats. Corporate presence 
already dominates the best seats; auction
ing off optimal seating areas will push the 
Average Joe farther away from the action. 
Trendy rock and pop acts probably prefer 
energetic youth grooving in the front rows 
at concerts, where they belong, over corpo
rate suits standing still or sitting down.
Ticketmasters auctions may be official 
and legal, but they still constitute scalping, 
an unethical business practice. Scalping
gouges unreasonably high profits from the 
cheated and wronged consumer.
Scalping is an unscrupulous alternative to 
the mainstream commerce, by which con
sumers purchase goods in a generally fair 
manner. As Ticketmaster follows a trend of 
replacing conventional ticket sales with its 
scalping-like auctions, it replaces a benign 
business practice with a reprehensible one.
For sold-out events, Ticketmasters auc
tions will be more restrictive than tradition
al scalping. Scalping on the corner near 
entertainment events reaches out to people 
otherwise unable to obtain tickets. 
Ticketmasters auctions seek to further liriiit 
the audience of those who possess tickets. 
This policy excludes more of the market 
from enjoying Ticketmaster-affiliated 
events and further restricts games and con
certs to the privileged few.
Spreading the anti-Ticketmaster vibe, jam 
band The String Cheese Incident and its 
affiliate SCI Ticketing filed a lawsuit against 
Ticketmaster last month. They claimed that 
the companys arguable monopoly inhibits 
trade and violates the Sherman Antitrust 
Act.
String Cheese seeks to sell more tickets 
directly and affordably to fans and thus 
avoid Ticketmasters high service fees. This 
practice, sanctioned by Ticketmaster for a 
variably low number of tickets, was pio
neered by the Grateful Dead in the early 
Eighties. Ticketmasters refusal to substanSee TICKETMASTER, page All

Last Wednesday in Cancn, Mexico, 
South Korean farmer Lee Kyung-Hae 
climbed to the top of a high-security fence. 
Holding a sign that read WTO kills farm
ers, he drew a knife and stabbed himself in 
the chest. He died later that night.
Kyung-Haes death occurred in the midst 
of last weeks World Trade Organization 
(WTO) trade talks. The Cancn summit was 
organized to continue the 146-nation orga
nizations Doha round of talks (after 
Doha, Qatar, where the WTO met two years 
ago).
The developing countries major bone of 
contention this time around was agricul
ture, and with good reason: they depend on 
it for a living. Meanwhile, rich states, like 
the U.S., Japan, and the E.U., spend more 
than $300 billion per year subsidizing their 
own agribusiness.
Because of those subsidies, rich countries 
can sell food for less than it costs to produce, 
and no developing countries can compete 
with that. Theres a reason developing 
nations are poor, and it has to do with an
outdated American policy that began dur
ing the Depression.
FDR instituted agricultural subsidies to 
help American farmers overcome poverty 
and prevent malnutrition. The program 
continued even as increasing mechaniza
tion of farms led to huge gains in the 
amount of food produced by American 
farming companies.
Today the national health problem is not 
malnutrition, but obesity. Our farms pro
duce a glut of food, too much to sell in our 
own country, so the farming companies 
export it across the world at dirt cheap 
prices.
Consequently, farmers in developing 
countries cant sell their goods to people in 
their own towns - its cheaper to buy 
imported, subsidized powdered milk than 
fresh milk from the dairy next door. The 
dairy goes under, and the country sinks far
ther into poverty as it becomes less self-suf
ficient and more dependent on rich coun
tries exports.
Developing countries have the lowest 
agricultural production and labor costs in 
the world. If all else were equal, theyd have 
the competitive advantage in the global 
marketplace.
For a conservative administration to 
espouse the ideal of free trade but spend bil
lions each year on handouts to its farming 
companies is blatantly hypocritical.
Vanessa Shyu/Art Staff
But the hypocrisy is easily explained: the 
Farm Belt donates heavily to the Republican 
party.
And, to say thanks, President Bush 
approved a 70 percent increase in farm sub
sidies in the Farm Bill last year, though 
other Republicans implored him to veto it.
Some unexpected developments did arise 
in Cancn, like the group of 21 developing 
nations, from India to Brazil, that banded 
together to demand their own agenda, 
including the four African countries who 
protested the damage that had been done to 
them by cotton subsidies (and who were 
supported by the WTOs usually-neutral 
Director General, Supachai Panitchpakdi). 
But the U.S. and E.U. would not negotiate 
on these subjects and instead focused on 
four proposals having to do with foreign 
investment and competition. As a result, the 
talks fell apart on Sunday.
It seems fair negotiation will only happen 
when the U.S. government practices what it 
preaches.
Developing nations deserve a level play
ing field on which to compete, and its up to 
privileged countries like ours to make that 
happen.

THE TARTAN  SEPTEMBER 15, 2003Ail
Goodbye old 
greenback, 
hello peaches
Terrorist bad, 
timing bad, 
policy good
Hurry up with nation 
building, time to exit
American and British forces as 
servants of historical events rather 
than masters.
The post-conflict resistance 
movement was underestimated 
and mischaracterized. To suggest 
that the violence greeting occupy
ing forces was the product of liberation-shock or that it was 
hatched by a small number of 
petty crooks and dock-robbers is 
an absurdity and a lie. The attacks 
carried out against American and 
British forces resemble nothing so 
much as a calculated assault by 
entrenched forces given harbor by 
sympathetic Iraqis. At least 15 
Americans are injured a day, 
mostly in central Iraq, the socalled Sunni triangle, and the 
post-war dead now exceed those 
killed in the actual war itself. 
Rumsfelds blithe optimism does 
nothing to diminish this fact.
What will ultimately test 
American staying power in the 
country is how we respond to the 
actions of surrounding Middle 
East nations. The destabilization 
on the scale that some orientalist 
scholars predicted has not hap
pened; in its place is an ongoing 
defensive shift among nations 
who feel targeted by Bushs 
National Security Strategy and  
those that wish to control their 
own populations in the face of a 
free and liberal Iraq. We know 
that Iran is on track towards 
nuclearization, against the wishes 
of the U.S. and with tacit support 
from our bipolar ally Russia. 
Similarly, Egypt will have its next 
set of elections about the same 
time that Iraq is scheduled to have
Dain PascocelloAdam GreenbergBen Hackett
Presumably, ours is an adminis
tration that exults in accountabili
ty. In everything from education 
to corporate oversight, President 
Bush and company have relied on 
this language with leaden regular
ity. Its a shame therefore that the 
practice hasnt carried over into 
the category of nation building.
Since May 1, regarded as the end 
of major combat operations, there 
have been several missteps in the 
recuperation of Iraq: the lack of a 
post-war exit strategy; an under
estimated cost; the lingering 
threat of terror directed at both 
Western soldiers and innocent 
Iraqis; and the failure to convince 
the European elite that the occu
pation is also their problem.
Secretary of Defense Donald H.
Rumsfeld was charged with the 
responsibility, nearly unfettered, 
to ensure that pains were taken to 
avoid the above. In five months 
time, he has failed. To be sure,
Iraq is not so bad as those on the 
left would have us believe; it is 
also not so good as some within

On October 9, the United States 
Bureau of Engraving and Printing 
(BEP) will release the United States 
first non-greenback note.
The 2004 20 dollar bills peachy 
countenance will be followed by sim
ilarly colored bills of other denomina
tions.
And it seems that counterfeiters 
have not just inconvenienced the 
national economy again, but also 
have led the BEP to issue money that 
Americans will likely recognize, 
while their machinery will not. 
Indeed, many vending machines 
havent even been reprogrammed to 
accept series 1996 20 dollar bills.
The familiar faces of the 1929 bills, 
aside from signatures and dates, 
barely changed for over 60 years until 
the 1996 press runs removed them 
from circulation. Only eight years 
later, the BEP proposes to innovate on 
their recent effort.
Older currency designs were 
among the most recognizable sym
bols this country had, and sported the 
familiar greenback design in some 
manner since the end of our countys 
Civil War.
In changing the moneys style, the 
Department of the Treasury hopes to 
reduce copying, but the benefits of 
new money hardly balance the incon
venience and the sacrifice of identity. 
But if the BEP insists on a strategy of 
change for protection, it must be 
more radical in its designs.
The new 20 dollar bills, to be 
joined by series 2005 50 dollar and 
100 dollar bills, innovate little on the 
BEPs anti-counterfeiting technology: 
watermarks, woven threads, and 
color-shifting ink.
These are no different than the 
technology they used eight years ago 
to defeat fraudulent bills, and yet 
they have not progressed except to 
release new bills faster than printing 
plates can be forged. When it 
becomes more than 20 times more 
difficult to manufacture 20 dollar 
bills than it is to manufacture one dol
lar bills, why not go after the coun
trys lesser bills, unchanged in the 
1996 reissue?
Some answers to the United States 
counterfeiting problem lie with other 
nations banknotes. Colored bills are 
a start, and along with thwarting 
some counterfeiting efforts, they aid 
those with sight problems. Sizing 
bills differently produces similar 
effects. The Euro bills released by the 
EU in 2002 used this method  a 500 
Euro note is 1.7 times larger than a 5 
Euro note.
Fewer available bills mean fewer 
possibilities for counterfeiters too. 
Coins are both more difficult to coun
terfeit and more cost-effective to 
mint; neither the EU nor the Bank of 
England prints a bill in their smallest 
denomination. U.S. coins last 30 
years compared with 18 months for 
the one dollar bill.
When the U.S. Mint started pro
ducing the new golden dollar  a 
misnomer, as they are actually made 
from a copper alloy  they missed 
their golden opportunity to elimi
nate one of the countrys potentially 
counterfeited bills.
They ran television commercials 
for the new money, rather than the 
ultimate advertisement for a dollar 
coin: ordering the Federal Reserve
The embattled and politically 
weakened Yasser Arafat got a boost 
this past week, but not from the 
group one might expect. This boost in 
popularity came from the Israeli deci
sion to make public their intent to 
expel Arafat from the country. This 
new Israeli policy has much merit, 
and many would argue the measure 
appropriate. However, Israel has once 
again made a political miscalculation, 
helping to bolster support for Arafat 
at a time where his evaporation from 
the public and international eye 
would aid the peace process.
The obvious reasons behind the lat
est Israeli policy decision are attempt
ed political revenge over the latest 
bombings carried out by Hamas on 
September 9. Hamas claimed respon
sibility for two homicide bombings in 
Israel that killed 16 people and 
wounded over 50, bombers not 
included. The unfortunate interna
tional condemnation of Israels 
actions is simply serving to strength
en Arafats position in the Middle 
East. And Arafat has capitalized on 
the Israeli decision to make the policy 
of expulsion public by demanding 
that Israel come back to the table for 
peace talks. Wonderfully political, 
this terrorist-turned-former-PrimeMinister is. Regardless of condemna
tions from the UN, the U.S., Great 
Britain, and the international com
munity, Israels policy is justified. In 
fact, the only problem with the policy 
was in the timing of its implementa
tion. A senior Israeli advisor Raanan 
Gissin defends their position, stating, 
Arafat is the main obstacle to peace 
and that is why weve decided in prin
ciple to expel him.
I want to put this gently, I really do, 
but I just cannot: Yasser Arafat was 
and is a terrorist, and continues to 
support terrorist actions. But enough 
allegations, here are some facts. 
Yasser Arafat ideologically encour
ages the condemnable terrorist 
attacks. He authorized many, provid
ed financial backing for many, and 
personally headed the Fatah Al Aqsa 
Brigades (terror) organization. Is it 
just Arafat, or does the connection 
run deeper? The Palestinian

THE TARTAN  SEPTEMBER 15, 2003
Captain America zapped Iraq right between the eyes for the world
jogM dmtltA
James Auwaerter
Last Thursday, we commemorated 
the second anniversary of September 
11. We remember where we were 
! when we heard that the first World 
Trade Center tower was hit, then its 
; twin, and then the Pentagon. There 
didnt seem to be a reason for such an 
attack, nor were there culprits to 
whom we could immediately point 
for such a heinous act.
We know now the perpetrators and 
their motives  radical Muslims who 
hate Western culture, who would see 
the world under Shariah, but who are 
also willing to interpret and pervert 
the Korans teachings to subjugate 
& women and kill Jews and Christians, 
p whom the Koran refers to as people 
of the Book. They seek to convince 
the world of their power and right
eousness  for they see the two as 
closely linked  by terrorizing those 
who dare to disagree with this world
view.
The attack on the World Trade 
Center wasnt just an attack on 
America. People from 65 countries 
were killed that day. A letter purport
ing to be from Osama bin Laden laid 
out his desires for the world  a 
world freed from secular influences 
in politics, following only Islam.
In the end, hate for the West, and 
the United States in particular, is 
what drives them. It drives these 
false Muslims to work with people 
like Saddam Hussein, a noted secu
lar Muslim, who found his faith 
when U.S. troops came storming into 
Baghdad. Even now, assorted Islamic 
terrorist groups, including al-Qaeda, 
are flooding into Iraq, seeking a 
chance to fight against the hated 
Great Satan.
These groups will be defeated  
human history has moved inexorably 
towards more freedom. From the 
philosophers of the Enlightenment, 
to Americas Founding Fathers, to 
people like Bishop Romero, 
Mohandas Gandhi, and Nelson 
Mandela, with each year has come a 
freer world.
Stopping the threat posed by ter
rorist groups wont be done by ignor
ing or diminishing the threat that 
they pose.
Two of the largest terrorist attacks 
in Iraq were not on American troops, 
but on the UN mission in Iraq, and on 
the most holy Shiite mosque in Iraq
 the Imam Ali mosque in Najaf. 
These targets seem to have been cho
sen for two reasons  the symbolism 
of the attacks and the ease of accessiThese actions by them

than any oil-for-food 
program ever would. 
bility to the locations.
American troops offered to help 
guard both locations, but were 
turned down. Shiite officials asked 
United States troops to stay away 
from the mosque out of respect. A UN 
spokesman for the mission told CNN 
before the attack, We dont want a 
lot of security, because were here to 
help the people of Iraq.
America broke the Iraqi army into 
pieces. The Baathists who ran all of
Iraq are mostly removed from their 
lofty positions. Uday and Qusay 
Hussein, Saddams two heirs, were 
shot dead in a house, dying in a futile 
fight.
These actions by themselves help 
regular Iraqis more than any oil-forfood program ever would. They lay 
the foundation to rebuild Iraq, to 
make it a more democratic nation 
where the people can live without 
fear of offending someone who could 
be one of Saddams tribesmen.
Both groups realized the value of 
American troops providing securi
ty after it was too late. Kofi Annan, 
the UN Secretary-General, had a 
press conference soon after the UN 
bombing, saying that the responsibil
ity for security in Iraq was the 
Coalitions in the end. He 
backpedaled a bit in subsequent 
press conferences, after the 
American offer to help guard the mis
sion came to light.
He also ignored UN culpability in 
his statements on the attack: the UN 
mission head had retained all of the 
guards provided by Saddam (who 
also moonlighted as spies). This 
probably contributed to the bombs
location and timing, both of which 
maximized casualities among the UN 
leadership in Iraq.
Meanwhile, leaders in Najaf have 
changed their minds about allowing 
Americans near the temple, asking 
help from the FBI in the investiga
tion. There are several groups that 
have motives for the attack  Sunnis 
upset that the destruction of the 
Baath party means the destruction of 
their political power, another faction 
of Shiites seeking to weaken their 
ideological opponents, or anyone 
who wanted to make ordinary Iraqis 
blame the U.S. for inadequate securi
ty-The attack was viewed as an assas
sination, and it was a real blow to the 
Coalition. The cleric killed, 
Mohammed Baqir al-Hakim, was a 
popular moderate who urged 
patience with the Coalition forces 
and called for greater unity among 
Shiites.
Because of this popularity, the 
investigation has been proceeding 
rapidly. According to Iraqi police, 19 
people have been arrested in connec
tion with the bombing, and all have 
admitted links to al-Qaeda.
Western culture places an empha
sis on individual freedoms. Since 
September 11, 2001, laws like the 
Patriot Act have limited some ol 
those freedoms. Without getting into 
whether these steps were justified, 
we can all agree that America today 
is less free in many ways than before. 
On the other hand, Afghanistan and 
Iraq are now much more free. 
Americas actions in these countries 
show the world that we live the way 
we speak.
It would have been easy to carpetbomb Afghanistan aiid Iraq. We 
could have rolled into Baghdad and 
left as soon as the government broke 
up, rather than staying and trying to 
rebuild Iraq. It would have been easi
er still to do nothing in the face of this 
tragedy. Thats happened too many 
times before. Instead, American 
troops fought and died, not for oil, 
not even for vengeance. They fought 
for their countrys freedom, and the 
worlds.

IRAQ, from page All
its first. This moderate Muslim nation fears a 
descent into protest and violence if Egyptians 
see the one man-one vote democratic process in 
Iraq and weigh it against their own nominally 
free elections. Our mission is to accept a world 
that has perhaps more than a handful of 
nuclear state powers (though I wouldnt say 
this includes Iran) and remain out of the 
tumult of surrounding Middle Eastern coun
tries. Otherwise, a sustained regional presence 
in the hopes of getting things just right could 
one day produce a real quagmire.
The war in Iraq may have unleashed precise
ly the problems it was intended to solve.
Despite the failure to mention WMDs in his 
September 7 speech, Bush may now be faced 
once again with stopping them. One of the 
unintended consequences of the war might 
have been the large-scale transfer of biological, 
chemical, and nuclear weapons to al-Qaeda, 
something which the president ostensibly 
undertook the conflict to prevent in the first 
place. Whether or not you believed in the immi
nent threat posed by Saddam Hussein (I did 
not), the point now should be to determine 
definitively whether weaponry, especially of 
the radiological kind, still exists within Iraqi 
borders. Each day the president avoids this
question, another soldier dies in vain.
Throwing billions of dollars this year and 
next at Iraq is not the answer; there should be a 
clear exit-strategy. Security forces need to tend 
to the borders and the Governing Council 
should concentrate on property rights, a stable 
currency, and free market practices rather than 
obsess over universal enfranchisement. Our 
numbers should be cut over time to around
50,000, or about where the Congressional 
Budget Office recommends, in order to free up 
enough resources to hunt and kill terrorists 
where they really live. Following September
11, 2001, there was a brief period where the 
only thing on my mind was revenge - the desire 
that we should exterminate as many terrorists 
as possible. I was not alone in this opinion, but 
somehow seven out of ten Americans believe 
Iraq was also to blame. Now that we have Iraq 
we must do what we can and move on, with 
errors noted and their culprits held account
able, on both sides. Revenge alone cannot for 
long sustain a foreign policy. Can it?

ARAFAT, from page All
Authority set aside money from its budget to 
pay salaries to Fatah terrorists. The numbers 
are staggering, as 45 million dollars a month 
from Arab countries are being used to pay the 
salaries of terrorists. Fatah and Al Aqsa 
Martyrs Brigades are shown to be the same 
by documents seized by the Israel Defense 
Forces during Operation: Defensive Shield.
As thousands of Palestinians form a human 
shield around Arafats Ramallah compound, 
one must marvel at the success of the disin
formation and brainwashing of the 
Palestinian people as a whole. The people 
that surround his compound, shielding him, 
are shielding a man who is widely known to 
be the leader of the Fatah movement, with 
many terrorist organizations under its wing. 
Fatah is directly involved in, or associated 
with, hundreds of murders of innocent civil
ians, some of whom were Palestinians that 
simply supported reform of the PA.
Organizations which Arafat headed, and 
those he continues to be involved in have 
even overshadowed Hamas and Palestine 
Islamic Jihad as the leading murderers of 
innocent civilians at times. Yet this man con
tinues to garner international support as 
nations condemn Israels policy of expulsion.
The reasons for the international censure of 
Israel are unclear, but the scent of politics 
and cowardly natures abound. The justified 
expulsion of Arafat would no doubt increase 
the violence on the short-term, as many 
Palestinian and Arab terror organizations 
have vowed to step up homicide bombings if 
he is expelled. However convenient, it is not 
the fear of bloodshed that pushes the inter
national community to come down harshly 
upon Israel. The United States aside, many 
countries still consider Arafat to be a promi
nent Palestinian political figure and still talk 
with him. These countries would hate to 
become embarrassed when the Arafat ouster 
eventually yields forward progress in the 
peace process.
The Israeli policy decision is only flawed in 
timing, not reasoning. One could deduct 
points for political miscalculation from the 
Israeli scorecard. However, since the playbook is already exposed, it may simply be 
time to throw Arafat out. The only scary 
potential event is that if Arafat were simply 
expelled, he would be free of the internal and 
regional pressures that have forced his hand 
those few times he has compromised.
Ben Hackett (b>hackett@J welcomes all 
responsible replies.
Money could 
use some 
more change
MONEY, from page All
Banks to remove dollar bills from cir
culation.
More frequent money redesign is 
going to become the norm, even if we 
take other steps toward reducing 
counterfeiting operations, but more 
drastic design changes would go sig
nificantly further in preventing 
copies and lengthening reissuance 
processes.
At the same time modernizing oui 
money would narrow the gap in inter
national currency design and save the 
U.S. government millions of dollars in 
production and enforcement annual
ly.

close. The surprising part of the team 
is their youth. Built off a strong 
recruitment effort by Kendra, the 
team could be a real force as the sea
son progresses.
When we play together as a team, 
its the best CMU team Ive ever 
coached, said Kendra. Three of the 
four first-year recruits start, though 
the team has enough depth that the

StaffwriterFumbling towards victory
The Tartan football squad continued to roll 
last Saturday when they took on Grove City 
College at Gesling Stadium. By games end, 
they had accumulated 5 touchdowns, which 
was enough to outplay the Wolverines by a 
score of 35-21.
The game started out for the Tartans much 
like it did in the previous week against Bethany 
College. CMU recovered a couple of early 
Wolverine fumbles, and was able to capitalize 
with 3 touchdowns before the first quarter 
ended.
The Tartans first drive, however, was purely 
offensive domination. The Tartans received the 
ball first and marched 71 yards in 4 plays to 
take a 7-0 lead. Junior fullback Brad Stanley 
scored the touchdown with a 7-yard run.
It would not take Stanley long to find the 
end zone again. After a Grove City fumble was 
recovered by senior Matt Danielson, the 
Tartans took over on Grove Citys 20-yard line. 
Two plays later, Stanley landed himself in the 
end zone after a powerful 18-yard scamper.
Stanley would go on to finish the game lead
ing all rushers with 122 yards, along with 4 
touchdowns. Stanley doesnt take all the credit 
for his impressive statistics, however.
The offensive line was really able to drive 
Grove City off the ball and open things up for 
the running backs while the defense was able 
to create turnovers, said Stanley.
The imposing CMU defense did not stop 
there, as the next Wolverine possession found 
itself victim to another fumble, this time with 
the Tartans recovering on the Grove City 22- 
yard line.
Offensively, this game was actually very 
similar to last week, said head coach Richard 
Lackner. We were able to really take advan
tage of their turnovers.
The Tartans eventually converted the second 
Grove City turnover to a touchdown, on a 1- 
yard plunge by Stanley. As time expired for the 
first quarter, CMU had a 21-0 lead.
In the second quarter, the Tartans found 
themselves with good field position yet again 
thanks to a 43-yard punt return by senior 
defensive back Joe Ciccarelli. Five plays later, a
1-yard Stanley rush put the Tartans ahead at 
28-0.
In last weekends away game versus the Bethany 
Bison, CMU lead 21-0 after the first quarter, in no 
small part due to turnovers that left the Tartans in 
easy scoring position. This weeks game versus 
Grove City carried on in the same way, with the 
Tartans up 21-0 at halftime.
After a .500 season that snapped off almost three 
decades of winning seasons, the Tartans are look
ing this year to get back to old traditions, but with 
a new defense. Defensive coordinator Terry 
Bodnar has changed the teams defensive setup to 
a 3-3 scheme.
Junior fullback Brad Stanley ended the Tartans 
second game and second victory with 122 yards 
and four touchdowns, running the ball short, and 
running the ball long, he credits his performance 
largely to his team, saying that the offensive line 
created holes in the opposition, and that the 
defense provided many turnovers.
Next up: Hiram College at home, 1 pm, Saturday.
The only other action either team would see 
in the remainder of the half came from a sus
tained drive by Grove City. They mounted an
11-play march to the end zone, capped off by a 
7-yard rush by quarterback Sam Mowrey.
When Grove City came out after halftime, it 
appeared to be a new team. Their second quar
ter touchdown gave them a new spark, as it led 
them to connect for two more scores in the 
third.
You have to give credit to Grove City, said 
Lackner. Their time of possession in the third 
quarter was a lot; they just wouldnt lay down.
The first scoring strike for Grove City in the 
second half came on a short 2-yard rush by Ken 
Roudybush. After a quick CMU punt, the sec
ond touchdown came on a 45-yard pass recep
tion from Sam Mowrey to Dave DiDonato, on 
what appeared to be a controversial offensive 
pass interference no-call. Regardless, the score 
would stand at 28-21 entering the fourth quar
ter.
Quite possibly the key play of the game came 
with 12:35 remaining in the fourth quarter.
With the momentum in their favor after 
recovering a CMU fumble and then converting
a 38-yard flea-flicker pass, Grove City was on 
the CMU 19-yard line determined to tie the 
game.
However, a deflected Sam Mowrey pass 
found its way into the hands of senior co-captain inside linebacker Greg Botta, who 
returned the interception 46 yards into Grove 
City territory, nulling the treat of a Wolverine 
score.
This week our coaches had been instructing 
us to get to our pass drop coverage quicker and 
break on the ball, said Botta. When you have 
a swarm of players around the ball, things are 
bound to happen, especially with great pres
sure by the defensive line.
Bottas interception would give the Tartan 
offense another opportunity to score. They 
responded well, putting together a lengthy 
drive that ended in a 15-yard corner dive by 
junior running back Ryan Neupaver.
We were able to stay with our blocks all 
day, said Neupaver. Our misdirection plays 
worked well and our receivers made some 
great blocks downfield to allow the backs to 
get free. Neupaver finished with 90 total 
yards, including a nice 39-yard jaunt.
Grove City made another attempt at the end 
zone, but eventually was stopped cold by the 
CMU defense.
The Tartans took a knee and finished the 
game at 35-21.
Although it was apparent that the Tartans 
had come a long way since last weeks victory 
at Bethany, the team still is not satisfied.
Were never satisfied with our improvement 
because you can always improve, said senior 
wide receiver Chris Kay. You can either get 
better or worse, you never stay the same. Each 
day we try to go out and get better.
Even though the Tartans know they need to 
continue improving one game at a time, many 
feel optimistic about the direction the season 
has headed thus far.
The season is looking great, said Botta. A 
lot of people thought that this would be a 
rebuilding year for us because of losing so 
many seniors, but I think we have a very ath
letic, hard-hitting team.
The team will now be focusing on next 
weeks contest against Hiram College. It will be 
another home game at Gesling Stadium begin
ning at 1 pm Saturday.

Women shut out Frostburg
by Andrew Johnson
Editor-in-Chief
The womens soccer team remained unde
feated Saturday after a 2-0 win away against 
Frostburg State University. The first half made 
it look like the Tartans might have suffered 
the same fate they had last year, however, 
when they went down 1-0 to the same team.
In our first half, we didnt play as well as 
we are capable of, said junior midfielder Amy 
Tsao. We werent connecting our passes.
Frostburg had made it to the NCAA playoffs 
last year after defeating the favored CMU 
squad earlier in the season, while the Tartans 
had missed the cut. The second half showed 
the mettle of the Tartans though, and their 
determination not to succumb two years in a
row. Their first score came from a cornerkick 
by sophomore midfielder/forward Jillian 
Erickson.
We have a lot of kids that are very talented 
in the air, so corner kicks should be a very 
good scoring opportunity for us this season, 
said coach Heather Kendra, referring to the 
teams skills outside of their kicks. Tsao said 
first-year midfielder Lisa Pascoli did an excel
lent job shielding the keeper so that the she 
was unable to make a clean save, ultimately 
deflecting the ball into her own waiting net.
Sophomore forward Hallie Dumont made 
the score 2-0 after a sustained drive and sup
port from senior midfielder Merry 
McConnochie and sophomore midfielder/for-' 
ward Julie Ricter, and Frostburg never made it

Junior Staffwriter
On a pleasantly cool Friday evening, while 
some students were participating in Greek 
Pledge Night, others came to see the mens 
soccer team sweep the Point Park College 
Pioneers six to nothing on home turf in 
Gesling Stadium. This win contributed to the 
Tartans three-game winning streak and an 
excellent start of the season.
The Tartans played very enthusiastically, 
not disappointing themselves or the few loyal 
fans in the stands and on the hill beside West 
Wing and Resnik.
The event began at a quick and vigorous 
pace; the ball was kept in the midfield for 
quite a while before the Tartans gained con
trol.
The Tartans took advantage of the oppo
nents confusion and took to their end. With 
43:54 on the board, junior forward James 
Steidel, with the help of a little interference in 
front of the net, put one past the Pioneers 
goalkeeper David Liefeld.
Shots were fired upon Liefeld for the next 
five minutes. Tartans kept the ball in their 
opponents end and tried to put one in. With 
some quick foot skills and speed, first-year for
ward Jonathan Browne blasted one by Liefeld 
unassisted, putting the home team up by two.
This lead gave the Tartans a chance to play a 
few of its rookies. With less than five minutes 
left in the first quarter, and CMU religiously 
keeping the ball in Pioneers end, first-year 
forward Andrew Park from the corner set up 
junior forward Alex Beck who placed one in 
the right corner of the Pioneers goal. The 
Tartan fans in the stands helped distract the 
Pioneers for the remainder of the quarter.
The fans yammering and the Tartans skill 
paid off. With less than a minute left, senior 
midfielder Mark Painter raced down the right 
sideline, with the Pioneers nipping at his 
heels, and fired a shot on goal too powerful to 
stop.
Up four to nil, Carnegie Mellon came out in
the second quarter just as lively as they had in 
the first. First-year midfielder Sean Filipovitz 
gained possession of the ball at midfield, con
nected with sophomore forward Jordan Esten 
who blew past both Pioneer defenders, but 
before a shot could be taken, the whistle was 
blown on the Tartans. The team, determined 
to put a five on the board, came right back 
with a wide-open shot by first-year forward 
Linden Vaughn which Liefeld somehow 
deflected.
Smelling blood, Vaughn connected with 
first-year midfielder Anthony Zenn who nicely 
placed one by Liefeld, in the lower left hand 
corner. With Carnegie Mellon maintaining 
possession of the ball for most of the second 
quarter, junior goalkeeper Dave Thomas had a 
pretty easy game. The Pioneers only had two 
shots on the Tartans goal, both of which were 
blocked.
With a little less than half of the second 
quarter left Park, with a penalty shot, put one 
near the Pioneers goal, and Zenn was able to 
get his head into it, which resulted in an amaz
ing almost-goal. The referees disallowed it due 
to interference on the field.
With 1:28 left in the game, Vaughn was able 
to put one past Liefeld to make it the sixth and 
final goal of the game. The Pioneers put up a 
fight, but the power of the Tartans was too 
overwhelming.
This game marked the third game of the sea
son and the third win.
This streak could be contributed to the 
strength and depth of the bench we have this 
year, said junior midfielder Brett Holmes.
Assistant coach Harry Ulrich commented 
that the season is going very well and thinks 
the success will continue as the season pro
gresses.
Anticipation is already lingering in the 
Tartans as senior midfielder Michael Leonhard 
said, I cant wait to play in the conference 
games. We are going to be pretty good this 
year.
The Tartans will play their fourth game of 
the season, away at Kenyon College, on 
September 17.

Tampa Bay 
Bucs will go 
all the way
9ctpd 8cttcsS,
Crazy. That is the only way to 
describe the first 1/17 of the NFL sea
son. Apparently I wasnt the only one 
getting hammered in week one; AFC 
East powerhouses Miami and New 
England fell victim to embarrassing 
upsets in their openers. Green Bay 
and Brett Favre all but relinquished 
the NFC North division by dropping a 
game to the revitalized Vikings, and 
the supposed-to-be-contenders 
Eagles received a rude welcome to 
the 2003 season at home against the 
world champion Bucs. Not to mention 
the fact that Carolina showed some 
nasty offense, Kurt Warner fumbled 
six times and wont get the start in 
week two, the Colts and Browns had a 
field goal battle, and Steve McNair 
and a backup kicker led the Titans 
over last years AFC champs the 
Raiders. Geez, say all that three times 
fast. Anybody confused yet? Well fear 
not, Im your huckleberry. Lets roll 
through the AFC first.
Well, my pick to win this division, 
and the whole damn thing actually, 
dropped their home opener to the 
Houston Texans, leaving me with the 
proverbial egg on my face. But for all 
you little frontrunners out there, 
dont give up on Miami just yet. I still 
think this team has the talent to go all 
the way, and once they fire Dave 
Wannstedt and get a real coach they 
should power through the rest of the 
league. Ricky Williams is a gift; he is 
the best running-back in football, or if 
not, a close second to Priest Holmes. 
Once they figure out how to use him 
all the time instead of trying to throw 
the ball this team will win plenty oi 
games. Also, dont count on the 
defense to hide like it did last week; 
the Fins got a wake up call and should 
answer the challenge. They have an 
excellent chance against the Jets in 
New York where they have chronical
ly blown it. If they win this week I 
think theyre for real, and I predict 
theyll win the AFC Championship, 
but not the Super Bowl.
In other AFC interests, namely the 
Steelers and their division, everyone 
thought the Browns offense and 
Ravens defense would perform bet
ter than they did. There were also 
some question marks surrounding 
Tommy-gun after his golden season 
of a year ago. These were at least tem
porarily silenced, but there are still a 
lot of things to be decided in this AFC 
North. The Browns will not struggle 
offensively all year; if Holcomb con
tinues to falter then Couch will 
replace him. The Ravens D will be 
sick, and well see who caves this 
Sunday when the two meet up. This 
could alter the power structure of this 
division a little bit, but will more than 
likely have a greater impact on the 
AFC Wild Card. I see two certainties 
after week one: the local boys will 
walk away with this division 
(although they face a tough road 
game against Priest and the Chiefs 
this week), and the Bengals still suck.
Out west, the Niners looked like 
they had no trouble getting used to 
new Coach Dennis Erickson as they 
put on a 49-7 drubbing of Pittsburghs 
favorite choker Kordell Stewart and 
the Bears. Does this mean the Bay 
Area kids are for real? I cant say yet, 
they have a huge game this week in 
St. Louis. Mark Bulger is not great 
either, but is better than Kurt Warner 
at this point and his team is still 
potentially explosive, particularly 
against a weak San Francisco sec
ondary. However, Garcia looked 
sharp, and Owens is still a god. I pre
dict a shootout, and hope for a Niners 
victory. But even if San Fran wins this 
game, they should not set their expec
tations too high.
There looms a mountain in the 
NFC, towering out of Florida and 
looking down on all those who try to 
climb it. Even the mighty Eagles 
couldnt wing their way into the endzone against Tampa Bay, and the 
Philly Birds have one of the few great 
QBs in the league. Tampa Bay is fast 
enough to hunt down the mobile sig
nal callers like McNabb and Vick, and 
talented enough to pressure the clas
sic pocket passers like Manning and 
Bledsoe. There is no offensive line 
strong enough to stop the deluge of 
Sapp, McFarland, and Rice or block 
the monstrous Derrick Brooks. Not 
even the great running backs will get 
100 yards against this crew. This 
defense can be mentioned among the 
best of all time. So in not so many 
words, I recant what I prognosticated 
in my first column: Tampa Bay wins it 
all.
Enjoy the next week of football, 
and to all you who think Im a worth
less drunk I just made it an entire col
umn without using the word beer. 
Wait, whoops. Oh well, look for the 
Giants to roll over their ex-coach and 
the Cowboys on Monday night.

Westinghouse Electric Corporation donated a $150,000 elec
trical engineering lab to Carnegie Institute of Technology. At the 
time, it was the only lab of its kind in the world to reside in an 
educational institution. The lab had the necessary facilities to 
set up a miniature power system duplicating transmission lines 
and interconnected generators.

Morewood Gardens expanded its residency to men. Previously 
an all-girls house, despite the fact that males already had 24- 
hour access to the house, the dormitory was renovated to 
accommodate its new tenants. First-floor renovations included 
new furniture and wall-to-wall carpeting. Security also began 
keeping the entrances to all towers locked.

September 10, 1993
The Wall Street Journal ranked CMUs GSIA Program for 
Executives (PFE) as number one in a survey conducted by 
Brickers International Directory. The survey ranked the top non
degree public enrollment executive programs in the U.S. and 
Europe. Many of the best-known management courses at insti
tutions, including Harvard, Columbia, and Northwestern, 
earned lower ratings than the course at CMU.
5 YEARS AGO
September 14, 1998
The Childrens Television Workshop celebrated the thirtieth 
anniversary of Sesame Street by bringing a behind-the-scenes 
presentation, "Sesame Street Unpaved, to the CMU campus. 
Over 400 students, staff, and faculty members attended the 
presentation in the Rangos Room. Among the presenters was 
the Emmy award-winning actress and alumna Sonia Manzano, 
who played Maria on Sesame Street.
1 YEAR AGO
September 16, 2002
CMUs chapter of Delta Tau Delta was issued a University inter
nal citation for disorderly conduct for hosting a Girls Gone 
Wild party two weeks earlier, on August 30. Campus police 
issued two state citations at the party, for disorderly conduct 
and underage drinking, to two 18-year-old female guests who 
had participated in a contest where they took off their shirts. 
National Delta Tau Delta vowed to cooperate with police to 
determine whether the local chapter had illegally served alcohol 
to minors.

months. Phipps Conservatory will have an indoor rainforest
Above, the side view of the expanded complex. At right, guests enjoy tropical plants inside.
Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens has been 
a Pittsburgh staple since it opened in 1893. Families 
and horticulturists alike come every year to enjoy annu
al flower shows, temporary exhibits, and a permanent 
collection of plants from all over the world. Now, 
Phipps is expanding to include space for education, 
events, and extra botanical attractions, including an 
indoor rainforest.
We are all excited about the expansion, said 
Richard Piacentini, executive director of Phipps.
September 8 marked the groundbreaking ceremony 
of the Phipps Conservatory expansion. The $36.6 mil
lion project unfolding over the next 30 months will add 
a new entranceway, welcome center, Tropical 
Rainforest Conservatory, eight state-of-the-art produc
tion houses, a special events pavilion, and an educa
tional and administrative building.
The new Phipps Conservatory will lead visitors from 
Schenley Drive down a softly sloping entranceway 
ringed with elegant Romanesque pillars. Visitors will 
pass through the entranceway to enter the Victorian 
glass-domed 10,885-square-foot welcome center. There 
they will encounter a bank of elevators and a grand 
staircase leading up to the conservatorys renowned 
Palm Court. The welcome center will also include a new 
75-seat casual dining restaurant and caf, ticketing, vis
itors lockers, restrooms, and a gift shop twice the size 
of the current one. The new Tropical Forest 
Conservatory will sport features like a cascading water
fall railing down through the plant-life. An overhead 
catwalk will give visitors a birds-eye view of the water
fall.
According to Piacentini, the enhancements should 
increase attendance from 160,000 people to 250,000 
annually and bring in approximately $10 million in 
direct and indirect economic benefit for the area.
The expansion will make Phipps a national attrac
tion, said Piacentini.
Construction on the Tropical Forest and will begin in 
late winter and finish early spring 2004. When com
pleted, the 12,000 square foot addition will be approxi
mately one-and-a-half times larger than the existing 
Palm Court. During any sit-down occasion, a possible 
230 guests will be able to enjoy a view of the Pittsburgh 
cityscape and the Tropical Rainforest Conservatory 
from the special events pavilion. Expanded parking for 
94 cars and six buses will complete the project.
Phipps has been looking forward to expansion ever 
since it went under private management 10 years ago. 
It is currently in its second year of the Second Century 
Campaign to raise funds for the project. Thanks to gen
erous donations, the Campaign exceeded its phase one 
goal (by over $3 million) to raise $27.2 million from pri
vate, corporate, and foundation donors.
The expansion will make a nice addition to Oakland 
and to Schenley Park, said Pamela Reddy, communica
tion coordinator at Phipps.
Claire Tomesch, a first-year science and humanities 
major who volunteers at Phipps, thinks the additions 
will appeal to peoples desire for information as well as 
their need to relax.
The rainforest will draw in a lot more people and a 
wider variety of people. Some will come for their inter
est in the proposed Victorian architecture as well as the 
plant life, she said. The goal of the expansion, said 
Reddy, is to attract more visitors, including Carnegie 
Mellon students.
Not as many students visit as we would like. We 
would love to see more, said Reddy. You dont have to 
study horticulture or art to appreciate Phipps. Just stop 
in and get a calendar; our exhibits are always chang
ing.
Right now, Phipps offers an array of attractions. Until 
October 17, the annual summer butterfly exhibit is on 
display. Visitors can interact with live butterflies and 
watch them grow in hatching cases. The new 
Adventures of Lewis and Clark exhibit celebrates the 
200th anniversary of the Lewis and Clark voyage. It 
presents the plant-life Lewis and Clark discovered on
their trek across
America. Every Sunday in September is Salsa Sunday, 
featuring salsa dancing and cooking demonstrations by 
chefs from local Mexican restaurants. From 1 pm to 3 
pm, visitors can join in on salsa dance lessons and 
dance to the D.J. in the outdoor garden. All of these 
events are included in the price of admission, which is 
free for Carnegie Mellon students.
Phipps has one of the best fall flower shows in the 
country. Any student at Carnegie Mellon should come 
to at least one fall show before they leave, said 
Piacentini.
On October 18, the Fall Flower Show begins. Themed 
"The History," it will feature chrysanthemums of all 
varieties and will display photographs from the past. 
There will also be an expansion exhibit at the show for 
those who want to learn more about the project. Even if 
flowers are not your interest, Phipps is still an interest
ing place to visit.
Phipps makes a great retreat. Even during the day, 
its very peaceful over here. It is a nice place to spend a 
few hours between classes, said Reddy.

A Delicate Balance
The Pittsburgh Glass Centers delicate art has roots in the local glass industry
Courtesy of the Pittsburgh Glass Center
A detail of Table of Elements, A glass and mixed media sculpture by Jill Reynolds, currently on display at the Pittsburgh Glass Center. 
Reynoldss exhibition, Matter, runs through September 19th.
Glass is a holy medium. It is one of the 
few materials an artist must manipulate 
without ever directly laying a hand on it. 
The Pittsburgh Glass Center (PGC), 
located in Friendship, has created an 
environment where artists, students, and 
enthusiasts can appreciate the complexi
ty of such a strong yet delicate form. 
Ruled in the molten state by the pull of 
gravity and finished with water and coldworking techniques once solid, glass pro
cessing is an exciting journey. For hun
dreds of years, glass has been cultivated 
for its functional attributes, but thanks to 
the development of the studio glass 
movement in the 1960s, the intrigue of 
glasswork has finally raised it to the sta
tus of a fine art.
Pittsburgh played an early role in the 
history of American glass; the citys 
smoke-filled skyline at the turn of the 
century resulted in part from the smoke 
emitted from glass furnaces prior to the 
boom of the steel mills. Industrial glass 
manufacturing in Pittsburgh contributed 
to the citys economy well before the 
local steel industry did, though there is 
little evidence of glass work in Pittsburgh 
today, save the Pittsburgh Plate Glass 
Building, designed by Philip Johnson. 
When Pittsburgh was chosen to house 
the PGC, which was eventually made a 
reality by Davis Gardner Gannon Pope 
Architecture, the city pulled together to 
fund this non-profit venture.
The firm was able to build after finding 
support from the Blocks, a family of avid 
glass collectors who have toured their 
glass collection at the Carnegie, and 
local artist Kathleen Mulcahy and her 
husband Ron Desmett.
The design and execution of the center 
took nearly 10 years and two and a half 
million dollars, but the care taken to turn 
the old automobile showroom into a 
working studio and gallery shows 
through in every detail.
Much of the 16,000-plus-square-foot 
building is constructed primarily from 
recycled materials. The walls are made 
from cement board that makes them fireand impact-resistant. Salvaged corrugat
ed glass flanks the whole front face of 
the building, coating the exterior with 
fashionable flair and providing a breath
able screen for indoor activities. Theresa 
Cress, who works in Registration and is 
a Specialty Programs Instructor at PGC, 
observed that the studios supporters 
invested enough resources into it to 
make the facility unique.
They aimed at making this a prime 
facility, with top notch equipment, top 
notch everything, she said. And they did 
 state of the art torches, blowing 
benches, tools, kilns, furnaces and much 
more fill the Center, now managed by 
Dyana Curreri-Ermatinger, the director 
of PGC. The furnace that holds the main 
supply of molten glass for blowing runs 
constantly at an average temperature of 
2140 degrees Fahrenheit, requiring a lot 
of energy and creating heat waste. PGC 
has taken advantage of this, running the 
heat waste on a continuous loop that 
heats the buildings rooms and water. 
When the furnace is shut down, as it was 
for part of this hot summers August to 
save energy and for general mainte
nance, bringing it back up to tempera
ture takes nearly a week. If the bricks 
that line the furnace are heated too rap
idly, cracks can erupt in the structure 
and cause heat to escape and the liquid 
glass to seep into the cracks, eventually 
leading to a broken furnace. Because of
PGCs construction, layout and efforts to 
conserve, it has earned a gold Leadership 
in Energy and Environmental Design 
(LEED) rating.
PGC is still a fresh addition to the 
Friendship community,. having been 
opened to the public as it was in January 
of 2002. With demonstrations from visit
ing glass celebrities like Seattle-based 
Dante Marioni, intensive workshops, and 
a mission statement to support and pro
mote glass arts, the PGC is a unique envi
ronment. The center offers various 
courses, some for college credit, in 
flame-working, glassblowing, bead mak
ing, and cold-working to both college 
students and the general populace. 
There are equipmentand spacerental 
options, private lessons, youth pro
grams, membership opportunities, and 
even a gallery venue. The Hodge Gallery 
hangs the work of established glass 
artists, student glass work, and mixedmedia work, like photography and sculp
ture, that incorporates glass. No pieces
are priced; PGC is not a commercial 
gallery, just a place where skill can be 
shared and developed. PGC runs a vari
ety of special evening activities such as 
Hot-Jams, where food, music, and 
glass all come together for a fun night of 
community involvement. When visiting, 
there are also massive resource materials 
to be absorbed at the center including a 
video library and books on glass  not to 
mention meeting and working with the 
passionate staff.
Its an amazing place, said PGC resi
dent technician and flame-working spe
cialist Duff OBrien.
Right now at the Hodge Gallery is Jill 
Reynoldss Matter, up until September 
19. The Annual Gala: Meltdown 2003 
will be on October 4 from 6 pm to mid
night. Call 412.365.2J45 for more infor
mation or visit the website www.pittsburghglosscenter. org

Phil Anselmo visits Big Als Metal Shop
The Pantera frontman on his health, his career, and how he could beat David Lee Roth in a coolness contest
Courtesy of Pantera
Anselmo with Pantera, on tour in Slovenia.
Philip Anselmo. Anyone familiar with 
hard rock will recognize the name, and 
more so the persona. Probably the defin
ing heavy metal band of the 90s was 
Pantera, their dominion invoked when 
Phil, Dime, Rex, and Vinnie stepped off 
the stage they shared in the summer of 
2001 with Slayer and Morbid Angel, 
ready to conquer a new decade. It was in 
that moment that they proved, without a 
doubt, that they were the kings of the 
genre.
I personally had not witnessed the 
band in finer form than that hot summer 
night in Vancouver when I caught my last 
glimpse of the monster that was. In retrospect, we should have known; 
Pantera/Slayer had been whispered in 
hushed tones among mullet-farmers and 
chrome domes alike as the be-all and 
end-all of metal tours.
It was the antithesis of what Ozzfest 
had become  a tour that put together 
the two bands all metal fans wanted to 
see. A tour for us, not a tour to sell us on 
the latest fad. It was to be a new begin
ning in the metal genre, one that was 
fan-driven, and perhaps the end of cor
porate rap-schlock that still dominates 
the radio waves. With Pantera and Slayer 
gathering up the troops, 8,000 strong at 
some dates, we could make our point 
that metal was a vibrant force to be reck
oned with, pure and potent. Alas, in ret
rospect, maybe this tour was more of a 
farewell than a new beginning for 
Pantera.
The year ended quietly for Pantera,
and as 2002 arrived, metal fans rejoiced 
as they witnessed a rare sighting: a sec
ond Down album. In 1995, Phil Anselmo, 
Pepper Keenan (COC), Jimmy Bower, 
and Kirk and Todd from Crowbar assem
bled to produce the greatest side project 
of all time (write in if you want, that last 
statement is true).
Nola infused the sludge of the 
Louisiana swamp with the fire-breathing 
brand of metal that these men are known 
for. In doing so, Down gifted music with 
a new genre and a legion of fans to go 
with it, some lucky enough to have 
caught the handful of shows played 
before the members reconvened with 
their respective bands. For seven years, 
fans and interviewers alike asked Phil 
and Pepper for another album, and final
ly a hole appeared in everyones sched
ule. In retrospect, Panteras grueling 
tour-album tour cycle opening up at the 
end of 2001 was the clincher.
Down II is a fascinating album; while 
far from eclipsing the power of Nola, II 
has Phil singing with the melody hinted 
at in Nola, slowing down and seizing 
every note. In essence, this would be 
Phils Physical Graffiti, with the closer, 
Landing on the Mountains OfMeggido his 
Kashmir.
The album and the subsequent tours 
(especially the headlining spot on the 
second stage of last years Ozzfest, of all 
things) were seized upon by hungry fans 
who devoured the entire set from the 
opening video to the closing swirl of gui
tars that makes up Bury Me in Smoke.
At almost the same time, another of 
Phils projects, Superjoint Ritual released 
their years-in-the-making debut album, 
Use Once and Destroy. A confluence of 
early Thrash Metal and Hardcore, Use... 
is a throwback to earlier, vicious, impor
tant music in the history of our genre. Yet 
Superjoint makes it timely and relevant 
to the here and now, especially in the 
absence of any mainstream bands 
acknowledging these roots. For this rea
son alone, Superjoint has a place in the 
metal world, but Phil is known for much 
more than just reminding us where true 
molten metal comes from.
Every scream, every lyric, is Phil at his 
finest. Choosing to employ faster guitar
riffing over the lumbering giant riffs 
used by todays Metal-core bands, SJR 
delivers tight three or four minute blasts 
that are over before you know it.
And now, it seems that Superjoint is 
Phils full-time gig, having just released A 
Lethal Dose of American Hatred last 
month. What about Pantera, you ask? 
Well, I dialed up the man himself to talk 
about his past, present, and future. Over 
the years, I have sat a like a good little 
child in front of the TV as Anselmo ser
monized on what metal is and what it 
should be. Amazingly, his voice always 
had the same tone as his stage persona: 
stern, aggressive, yet comfortable in his 
own skin.
Actually, thats incomplete; the man is 
damn sure of himself, and he has the 
guns to back it up. So imagine the 
thoughts going through my mind as the 
phone rings in my receiver counted off... 
one ... two... three...
Hey, how are ya? answered a gruff, 
baritone growl at the other end. After 
rattling off compliment after compli
ment, I got a no bullshit And I thank 
you... back.
Albert Cohen: So a little history 
here... Whats up with Pantera, Phil?
Philip Anselmo: Well, after coming 
off a tour like the one with Slayer and 
Morbid Angel, theres really no place to 
go from there. Ive always wanted to go 
out  if I had to go out  on top, and 
that right there is what I think we did 
with the last album and tour. I think you 
cant top a tour like that. And with that 
success comes pressure to do things.... 
(He trailed off)
AL: Like what? In 96 when you had 
happy pop punk bands like No Doubt 
and the Presidents of the United States of 
America ruling the radio, you gave us 
The Great Southern Trendkill, probably a 
bleak, angry picture of society, and a 
best-seller. You sold out arenas with 
White Zombie on that tour.
PA: Yeah ... still, we had pressure now 
we got so big to do tours with bands like 
rap-metal ... shit whats a name, like 
Limp Bizkit or some shit like that. And I 
just wont do that, I just wont lie to the
kids like that. So now its Super-joint that 
Im doing.
AL: So, if you were offered a tour with, 
say Metallica, like Ive heard youve chal
lenged them with ... but in Pantera, 
would you do it?
PA: Why? Im in Superjoint now.
AL: Any covers in the set list?
PA: Naw ... I think thats cheesy, and a 
waste of time. Our sets are an hour and 
thats it. I want it like that, the pits you 
see are amazing, and I wouldnt want to 
mislead them.
AL: So why Superjoint, then, instead 
of any of your other projects youve had 
going over the years?
PA: When people do their own thing, 
they go off and do a supergroup, you 
know get the famous bassist and so on - 
Im not about that. Superjoint is what Im 
about - pure and simple.
AL: And for the future?
PA: We finish this tour were on right 
now, and then we do the Blackest of the 
Black tour in the Fall with Danzig.
AL: Over the years, people have been 
concerned with you and how youre 
doing healthwise. How are you now?
PA: Im as strong as an ox, and Im 
doing great. Live, I am the fucking king 
on that stage, nobody can touch, maybe 
David Lee Roth could have, but... nah...

Scout Niblett loves attention
The British folk-punk phenomenon politely does exactly as she pleases
People who keep track of the indie music scene will 
probably know a little about Scout Niblett. For the rest, 
many of whom are probably right now thinking, Ive 
never heard of him, Scout Niblett is a girl with a wig 
who has a thing or two to say.
Her album I Am, released in the U.S. on September 2, 
has turned more than a few heads. It is, in a word, dif
ferent  different from almost any other artist on the 
tour circuit, different from anything heard on the radio, 
different even from much of her own musical back
ground.
Born Emma Louise Niblett in Nottingham, England, 
Scout took her name after watching Harper Lees To Kill 
A Mockingbird. She took to music at an early age, with 
lessons at the recorder, the piano, and the violin.
Ive always loved music. When I couldnt sleep as a 
baby, [my parents] used to take me in the car and play 
me music to send me to sleep, she said. As far as I can 
remember, Ive always been into it. I got involved really 
early.
She describes herself as self-reliant, a quality which 
shines through her lyrics.
Nike says, Just Do It, and I think I agree, she sings 
to a drum beat in the song Nike, cause someones 
gotta do it, might as well be me.
At the age of 19, Scout made her way to an arts col
lege in Nottingham, where she worked intensely on her 
musical career. In 1999, she met drummer Kristian 
Goddard, with whom she released her 2001 debut, 
Sweet Heart Fever. That album, an eclectic use of her 
own vocal talents to folksy, at times nearly bluesinspired instrumentals, is hard to find, but worth the 
listen for anyone interested in something different.
Since then, she has recorded a split-release EP with 
current indie stars Songs: Ohia before beginning work 
on I Am. During that time she took up the drums, 
which, she said, accounts for the drastic difference 
between her first and second albums.
Aside from her U.S. label, Secretly Canadian, Scout is 
signed to super-trendy Too Cool in the UK  the same 
label formerly associated with such success stories as PJ 
Harvey, Stereolab, and Mouse on Mars. I Am was 
recorded by Steve Albini, who has previously worked 
with The Pixies and Nirvana.
But, far from being spoiled, Niblett wants more than 
anything to make use of what shes been given.
Ill be playing music whether anyones listening or 
not, because I just have to play music, she said. Its not 
like theres an end goal to me. The fact that I can do it is
whats important to me.
Jeff Cullers/Photo Editor
Niblett at the Quiet Storm last Wednesday.
Music, to Niblett, is a lifestyle.
I love touring, I love traveling and I love playing live, 
so it kind of works well for me, she said.
After spending a few weeks in America, she heads to 
Japan next week, then back over here for a month 
before heading off to Europe.
Although the tour has already had its ups and downs, 
to Niblett, the journey is as important as the destina
tion. During a show in Akron where there was nobody 
there, she didnt lose spirit  perhaps the opposite.
I suddenly realized that this is just amazing. I mean, 
if I wasnt here Id be in my apartment in Nottingham, 
tearing my hair out that I was still in Nottingham, she 
said. I suddenly realized that this was amazing regard
less of whether anyone was there or not.
Scout Nibletts music will not appeal to everyone, but 
it is not intended to. To a generation accustomed to the 
glazed-over pop vocals of Britney Spears, and overlyinstrumentalized alternative rock, Nibletts daring, dis
satisfied voice is a musical kick in the rear end. 
Listeners interested in hearing a woman and her feel
ings, with everything else stripped entirely away, 
should take a look into Scout Niblett. If nothing else, 
ignore the songs and spend a second to catch the idea 
behind the music, that willful sense of independence 
that Scout has translated into a lifestyle.
The thing behind my music is that its really an affir
mation to me of doing what I want, she said. This is 
exactly what I want to do and I dont see why I should
nt do it.

The Quiet Storm, a coffee shop located on Penn 
Avenue near the corner of South Graham Street, is 
just the kind of place where you might expect to see 
Scout Niblett. Judging from the small storefront, 
the expansiveness of the interior is surprising. A 
strange hash of brightly colored walls showcase 
artwork by local youth and teachers, and the cafe is 
scattered with childrens toys and various games 
that visitors can play with while waiting for a show 
to start.
The Malarkeys took the stage before Niblett and 
proceeded to play a captivating set of pleasingly 
melodic yet occasionally strange tunes. Their eclec
tic, multi-instrumental sound seemed to blend in 
perfectly with the homey-if-distracting backdrop, 
and it was hard not to find oneself swaying a little 
to the music, tapping a foot or a finger.
Niblett herself went up after some setup and a lit
tle bit of fuss. She took hold of her guitar, as though 
uncertain and began with a few quiet comments 
spoken into the floor. And then she started playing.
She sings as though she really needs to get her 
music out. She sings like she talks, seeming to 
always be a little distracted by something far away 
and meaningful, as though she is always trying to 
grasp it. She started out with Sweet Heart Fevers 
Miss My Lion, and let the strength of her vocals 
carry her away, rising to crescendos that seemed 
powerful enough to break the glass in the store
front. After screaming out her very heart and soul, 
Niblett stepped back from the microphone a little, 
to look down and let out a meek, Thanks.
Her music is mosdy vocals with a background of 
drums or guitar, and ranges from freeform shout
ing to cool, satisfying folk to electronic distortion 
reminiscent of an old Atari video game. Her live 
performance differs from the smooth sound of her 
studio recording; while on the CD you can hear the 
passion she feels in her warbling voice, theres 
nothing quite like her pounding on a snare drum 
and leading the crowd in a cheer for music, magic, 
and love.Theres a lot of it thats about realizing the 
reality of imagination, and how it kind of works in 
a magical way, she said of the songs on her current 
album, I Am. Her favorite song is Your Beat Kicks 
Back Like Death, in which she sings quite cheerily 
about death.
Her skill on guitar and drum are perhaps less than 
impressive, but her voice is strong. Her lyrics, on 
the other hand, are fully befuddling and border at 
times on disturbing. Think Pavements Slanted and 
Enchanted as sung by a frightened girl with only 
one instrument, and youre getting close. Its music 
that most people wont understand, many will 
hate, and some will really, really love. Give her a 
year or two tora come into her own and perhaps the 
world will have quite a musician on its hands.

Old, but alive and kicking
With a facelift, money, and lots of new friends, Lawrenceville is suddenly as popular as neighborhoods half its age
Celanie Polanick/ Pillbox Editor
Jim Savarino making soap at Jay Design on Butler Street. A new business opens up along here every four or five 
months, he said, maybe even more often than that."
As late afternoons shadow spreads on the streets of 
Lawrenceville, residents on the sidewalk begin to 
squint in the September light, as if trying to parse 
through the meaning of what they see. Everywhere, 
buildings are being singled out from the rows of dusty 
storefronts for renovations. Boarded up windows and 
doors still mar the long view of Butler Street, but as fall 
turns into winter, more and more of the storefronts will 
disappear for hibernation under tarps and scaffolding.
After some major readjustments, both good and bad 
 the loss of a major employer, St. Francis Medical 
Center, the opening of a Shop 'n Save on the main drag, 
Butler Street, and the arrival of hundreds of jobs with 
the new UPMC Children's Hospital and research facili
ty opening on the same site in 2007  the neighbor
hood is taking measures to lay in resources for the 
future.
Numerous nonprofit groups are constantly adjusting 
their grip on perennial issues like housing, commercial 
development, crime, and social resources. The 
Lawrenceville Corporation (LC) mediates the interac
tions between other groups and projects, fostering 
growth in the neighborhoods commercial and residen
tial sectors.
One well-received project, the 16:62 Design Zone, is 
a marketing campaign funded by the Pittsburgh 
Partnership for Neighborhood Development, designed 
to package and promote the space between 
Downtowns 16th Street Bridge and 62nd Street in
Lawrenceville as one unified, design-oriented district.
Grouping together parts of the Cultural District, the 
Strip District, Lawrenceville, and Bloomfield, the proj
ect attempts to make a network of all artand designoriented businesses and specialty goods and services. 
The primary publicity material for the Design Zone is a 
thick, colorful flipbook that maps out all arts-related 
businesses and is distributed to customers by each as a 
way of encouraging them to frequent the other busi
nesses inside. Thus far, the booklet is going places, and 
so are the businesses it touts.
The 16:62 design zone is absolutely flourishing, 
thanks to a strong committee and a wonderful business 
development manager, Pam [Devereaux,] said Lisa 
Pilewski, Lawrenceville Corporations executive assis
tant, who runs interference between the organizations 
commercial, residential and industrial programs.
New businesses in the Design Zone that ride the 
fringe of the aesthetics industry are flourishing, too. 
Most are purveyors of high-end goods for art-related 
niche markets like interior decoration, special events 
and gifts, and the strong network created by the pro
jects entrepreneur parties makes sharing clients a 
breeze. Rob Porachan, the owner of Blossoms & Wicks, 
sells upscale gifts and flowers for weddings, and sends 
his brides to local gift shops Awakening of the Senses 
and Jay Design Soaps & Gifts down the street. The 
proximity and quality of so many specialty stores, he 
said, is drawing in customers from far and wide.
The new businesses are bringing in new people to 
the area who would otherwise never come here, he 
said. These people are coming from Sewickley and Fox 
Chapel to Lawrenceville. I think its good for the older 
businesses, too. Because this isnt a destination spot 
like Shadyside or the South Side, people probably 
wouldnt come here just to discover it on their own.
Porachan wasnt originally interested in making a 
renovated Lawrenceville storefront the headquarters of 
his wedding-and-special-event business, now located 
at 3791 Buder Street, but as a member of the Design 
Zone, he feels completely at home.
The project is doing a teriffic job of bringing bus 
tours in here and showing off the area without the high 
cost of [advertising in] newspapers, he said. As small 
businesses, we usually cant afford to do major adver
tising, so it really helps.
But good marketing in more tangible forms can help 
even more, said Pilewski; the successful revival of 
Buder Street is largely due, she said, to the architectur
al refurbishment of the Streetface program, funded by 
the nonprofit Urban Redevelopment Authority, which 
grants commercial property owners funding for some 
much-needed renewal.
Depending on where your building is located on the 
main street, you can get up to 50 percent of the con
struction cost to renovate the faade. For example, if 
youre a one-story, mid-block storefront, you can get up 
to a $12,000 grant to renovate your building, said 
Pilewski, who believes a new storefront can work won
ders for the business inside.
It brings more people in. When you see a lot of 
development going on in a neighborhood, I think 
youre more likely to pull over and check out some of 
the shops. Youre more confortable. Youre feeling safe 
to park your car and check out [new things like] 
Emmas [coffee shop] and see that there is interest in 
the neighborhood, she said. There are a lot of people 
coming in that typically wouldnt come into 
Lawrenceville.
Lawrenceville United (LU), another community 
organization with a hand in the Streetface Program, 
runs various committees for neighborhood stability 
and diversity, but deals primarily with housing and 
public safety. LU has been working steadily with LC on 
an extensive housing plan that encompasses both 
destruction and remodeling.
According to Pilewski, the 3500 block of Penn 
Avenue will host a handful of newly built townhomes 
the LC hopes to sell for $130,000 apiece. Ground will 
break in November, and the houses should be on the 
market by spring, when the construction of another 
three townhomes, priced at $90,000 each, will begin at 
38th Street on the 3400 block of Penn Avenue; one has 
already sold for $135,000, said Pilewski.
The plan also calls for citizen involvement in the non
profit-driven effort to bulldoze deserted houses on 
Dresden Way, one of the sorest spots in the neighbor

crime.Company, has been around since 1922.
To complete smaller projects, grants are 
sometimes given to the nonprofits by 
banks, said Pilewski, but in the wake of 
this years economic upheavals this has 
become less common.
I think thats kind of across the board.
All the nonprofits are feeling the squeeze, 
said Pilewski. [Banks] can only give to us 
the amount that they make in interest, so if 
their interest is decreasing, so is what 
theyre giving out.
Other kinds of programming, particular
ly social initiatives, tend to rely on city and 
county resources instead. In addition to its 
commercial and residential programming, 
the Lawrenceville Corporation runs a fam
ily development service, funded through 
Allegheny County Department of Human 
Services, in the 5200 block of Butler 
Street, smack in the middle of the crimeaddled 10th ward. With a staff of four, 
including two advocates who make housecalls, the program currently serves 190 
families.
LC, in the mean time, is in the process of 
moving its offices into the 10th ward, 
where, said Pilewski, its influence seems
to be needed more. From there, she said, it --------------
can exert more leverage on the neighbor
hood and expedite the clogged process of directing 
community attention to the deserted houses on 
Dresden Way.
Here in the 6th ward, things are looking pretty 
good, said Pilewski. Theres a lot of private interest in 
the real estate here now, so the 6th ward is really pick
ing up. That wasnt the case 12 or 15 years ago.
A decade and more ago though, said resident Lena 
Hotujec, things were better.
There are a lot of drug problems in our neighbor
hood, a lot of run-down houses. We would like to see 
better housing, she said. Within the last ten years, its 
declined something terrible. We have a lot of lofts, we 
have a lot of new storefronts, we have a lot of arts, but 
I dont know if they create jobs. I see a lot of nice build
ings, but if they dont create money, I dont know.
Hotujec is the most involved member of the neigh
borhoods oldest community organization, the all-volunteer Lawrenceville Citizens Council (LCC), which 
serves as a liason between Lawrenceville nonprofits 
and elderly residents, and provides a forum where they

Judy McKnight Krynski started Emmas coffee shop in April of 2002 as a mid-life 
adventure,; now, she has loyal customers from all over the city and beyond.
The strength of the neighborhoods fami
lies was what saw the local economy 
through the closing of the steel mills, he 
said.
When the mills went down, it hurt the 
neighborhood, but it didnt hurt it as bad as 
other neighborhoods, because we had a lot 
of families here that helped their kids or 
their'brothers or sisters or cousins, he said. 
Ive seen other neighborhoods that, when 
the mills closed, they went down the tubes, 
especially their business districts.
Now, as a careworn residential business 
district welcomes dozens of new, urbane 
tenants, that same family spirit is turning 
strangers into friends. When Stefania Vitale 
came to Lawrenceville from Italy six months 
ago, she said, it immediately felt like home.

LCC often gets brushed aside at meetings between 
larger organizations, said Hotujec, but it represents the 
sometimes all-too-simple wishes of people who knew a 
better time in Lawrenceville.
VWhen I first came to Lawrenceville 55 years ago, 
this was a thriving community, she said. We had a 
jewelry store, we had a bakery shop, we had clothing 
stores, we had an A&P, we had a butcher shop, we had 
everything.
Now, said Hotujec, when people want the best prices 
on groceries or a pair of cheap shoes, they wait for the 
all-too-infrequent buses headed out of the neighbor
hood, traveling to discount stores and malls in the sub
urbs.
Jim Foley, former president and current board mem
ber of the LC, also remembers the safety and conven
ience of a Lawrenceville that relied on its then-thriving 
mom-and-pop stores. The most stable businesses in 
town, he said, have sustained themselves through the 
years by accruing the trust of a longstanding customer 
base. His insurance and estate agency, the Gribbin
------------ We imported everything from Italy, all
the marble [tabletops], chairs, the ovens, 
the bathrooms, everything, even the ingredients, the 
flour, tomatoes, the Buffalo mozzarella, said Vitale. As 
business continues to pick up, the little restaurant 
cheerfully accommodates large crowds during the din
ner hour most days with the laid-back social spirit of a 
true gathering place, she said. We want it to be like in 
Naples. Its a good excuse to [spend time] with friends, 
eating a good pizza.
Upstairs from the pizzeria, the Jeffrey Smith Studio 
more than fits the description of a neighborhood hang
out. A haircut at Jeffreys costs $60, but his clients are 
of every age and description, from all walks of life, he 
said; the move from Shadyside has only added to the 
mix.
We didnt lose any clients, and weve gained many 
new clients [since relocating]. Its been great, said 
Smith.
After buying, gutting, and remodeling a crumbling 
building into six spacious lofts, Smith moved into 
Lawrenceville three years ago and loved it, and made 
moves to transplant his salon from Shadysides 
Copeland Street, where it had enjoyed popular acclaim 
for 17 years. Smoke and dirt from fire in the adjoining
Theres a big participation of the resi
dents, new and old, to help shape this mas
ter plan, said Christiane Leach, a commu
nity liason at LU. Some of the houses they 
want demolished, and some of them they 
want rehabilitated. Its based on what the 
residents want.
When LUs call for residents to nominate 
the 30 worst houses in the neighborhood 
for elimination yields a consensus every
one can live with, said Leach, LU will move 
to get the citys bulldozers behind public 
opinion.
Ive been here for 40 years, on Buder 
Street. Before that, I worked at our family 
grocery store, right up the street on Penn 
Avenue. I came here when I was 18, the day 
after school. The old Irish guy hired me, 
because he already had a Polish guy. They 
wanted somebody who would bring in the 
Irish people, he said. This was a German 
parish here, and the Holy Family out at 44th 
[Street] was Polish, and then StreetMarys 
on 46th [Street] was Irish, and when every
body from the Old Country came over, they 
all settled right near their churches. And 
thats where their families are.

Now, a year and eight months later, Smiths new space

While sitting in the barbers chair, Lee Gross, owner 
of Buder Streets A1 Realty and landlord to many of the 
neighborhoods businesses, chatted with fellow cus
tomers about local goings-on. Gross shares Smiths pas
sion for renovating and renting neglected buildings.
When I got them, they were a mess, every one, he 
said of his buildings in Lawrenceville. Now he rents 
them as elegant storefronts to, among others, Regina 
Pizzeria, Blossoms & Wicks, Awakening of the Senses, 
Crystals Bead Bazaar, and a Vocelli Pizza further down 
on Butler Street.
While he declined to go on record with the exact

Once Upon A Time In Mexico
Drawing from classics of several genres, the well-made gunslingers tale is a treat to behold
tongue firmly in cheek (Johnny Depp says to Danny Trejo Are you a MexiCAN or a 
MexiCANT?).
The action sequences are as creative and sharp as the dialogue. Rodriguez is good 
at conveying emotion with his daring and unusual camerawork. One of the most 
impressive sequences shows Hayek and Banderas chained together attempting to get 
from the fifth floor of a hotel down to the ground by swinging from various objects. 
In a later sequence, two mariachis (played by Enrique Iglesias and Marco Leonardi) 
take out military officials with guitar-mounted flamethrowers and explosive devices. 
Is this over the top? Yes, but this movie is so much fun to watch that it doesnt make 
any difference.
Once Upon a Time in Mexico pays homage to Sergio Leones two genre favorites, The 
Good, the Bad and the Ugly and Once Upon a Time in the West. Sergio Leone was in turn 
paying homage to the samurai films of Akira Kurosawa. It will be interesting to see 
whether or not Rodriguezs work will stand the test of time long enough to inspire a 
new series of outlaw films in the future. Once Upon a Time in Mexico is better than 
Desperado, and is good enough to hold up under multiple viewings. The film never 
tries to achieve too much and, therefore, never lets the audience down. Although it 
is a tribute of sorts to Leone, it is also its own film. It draws on a venerable canon of 
clear, strong action films to present a unique take of the old-fashioned western, 
meshing vintage movie concepts like greed and revenge with a modern storyline and 
a wonderfully dark sense of humor. Although it wont leave audiences with anything 
deep to ponder, it is a thoroughly entertaining and visually stunning film.
Once Upon a Time in Mexico makes up for its lack of sensible plot with its wonder
ful performances. Banderas delivers lines with his usual intensity and does a good job 
kicking ass and taking names. It is Johnny Depp, however, who really steals the show. 
Played with a wonderful mix of goofiness and chilling brutality and indifference, 
Depp b character has the best lines and the best wardrobe in the movie. Willem Dafoe 
makes a surprisingly good Mexican and a very intimidating villain, but his talent is 
still underused. Mickey Rourke does a great job as Billy, Barillos right-hand man. 
Billy dresses atrociously and carries a little dog with him everywhere he goes. 
Although Salma Hayek only appears in flashbacks and has few lines, she still lights 
up the screen with her radiant beauty.

Thank God the Spy Kids hit puberty and the franchise has been laid to rest. Now, 
Robert Rodriguez can finally get back to doing what he does best: slick, ultra-violence with lots of sex and gore. Rodriguez made a name for himself in 1992 when he 
made the classic El Mariachi with only a few thousand dollars and an unknown cast. 
Three years later, with more money and Antonio Banderas, he made Desperado, a 
glossier but slightly less effective sequel. Now, Rodriguez completes the series with 
Once Upon a Time in Mexico.
Truth be told, it isnt necessary to see El Mariachi and Desperado to follow Once 
Upon a Time in Mexico. The film fills the audience in on whats important. El Mariachi 
(Ahtonio Banderas) is a musician who kills as well as he plays the guitar. At the start 
of the film, he is lying low in a small Mexican village in an attempt to live in peace as 
a musician. Unfortunately, a crooked CIA agent named Sands (Johnny Depp) wants 
to use him to fight the corrupt general Marquez (Gerardo Vigil) and the drug king
pin Barrillo (Willem Dafoe). El Mariachi wants to kill Marquez because he murdered 
his wife Carolina (Salma Hayek) and their daughter.
If all goes well, El Mariachi gets to kill Marquez, his nemesis, and Sands gets to run 
off with 20 million pesos. Sands also convinces retired FBI agent Jorge Ramirez 
(Ruben Blades) to track down and take out Barillo and his friend Dr. Guevera 
(Miguel Couturier). Confused? Dont worry; the plot is secondary in this film. Suffice 
to say everyone in the film is either corrupted by greed or out for bloody revenge. 
Rodriguez packs the plot with all things stereotypically Mexican: violent revolution, 
a military coup, corrupt politicians, drug cartels, the Day of the Dead parade, and 
lots of tequila and lime.

Like the work of actor-writer-director Sam Peckinpah, the maker of numerous clas
sic shoot-em-ups, Once Upon a Time is brimming with grisly shootouts and fight 
sequences. The violence, however, is so gory and so over-the-top that it transcends 
grossness and becomes almost humorous. Even torture sequences are easy for the 
audience to handle. These help keep the movie light and make it a lot of fun to watch.

his credits, calling Once Upon a Time a Robert Rodriguez flick that was written, 
directed, and chopped by Robert Rodriguez. Much of the dialogue is delivered withImages Courtesy of Columbia Pictures

Dickie Roberts, Child Stan
Family love for the price of a ticket stub
When we meet Dickie Roberts (David 
Spade), former child star, he is searching for 
that Holy Grail of Hollywood, a comeback. 
Since losing the spotlight, which happened 
before he hit puberty, Dickie parks cars for a 
living. He wears gloves at all times, to protect 
him from the harshness of the world. His girl
friend leaves him on the side of a desert road 
at the very beginning of the movie, while she 
hitchhikes off with a complete stranger. Even 
his mother ditched him after his show was 
cancelled. He isnt in this situation because he 
did anything wrong; he just stopped being 
interesting to the folks in TV Land. He 
gets so desperate to pick up bigname movie star contacts 
that he goes cruising 
around town, trying to 
get wind of auditions, 
which leads him to 
an audition for a 
juicy role in Rob 
Reiners new 
movie. It is a seri
ous role, and 
Dickie wants it, 
badly.
But even with 
the retroactive net
working, being a 
child star actually 
stands in the way of a 
mature acting career. In 
audition, Reiner says that 
because Dickie never had a 
normal childhood, he will have 
trouble connecting with some of |mage courtesy of 
the healthy feelings necessary to 
play the part of a happy person.
Reiner suggests a solution to his deep-seated 
personnel problems: hire a family.
After a fairly amusing sequence of audition
ing different families, Dickie finds one that 
seems perfect - the Finneys are the idyllic 
suburban family. He pays them $20,000 to let 
him live with them for a month as one of their 
kids. It doesnt take long for the family to get 
tired of him, but because of the cash, even 
after several disasters, they continue to give 
him second chances. Soon, Dickie is weaving 
himself into the lives of every family member, 
trying to make their lives better with the 
good, old-fashioned advice he learned on TV. 
For the most part, he succeeds. He teaches the 
mother Grace (Mary McCormack) to stand up 
for herself; and helps the daughter Sally 
(Jenna Boyd) prepare for the pep squad audi
tions. He even boosts the son Sams (Scott 
Terra) confidence with girls enough to get 
him to introduce himself to the beautiful new 
neighbor. After a month, Dickie auditions and 
wins over Reiner, but in true Hollywood style, 
he has found something better: a familys 
love.
appearances by well-known actors - all play
ing themselves. Brendan Fraser and 
Emmanuel Lewis play important roles early 
on, while Dickie is seen playing poker with 
other washed up child stars, including - in 
what was easily one of the most nostalgic 
moments of this movie - Dustin Diamond, 
better known as Screech from Saved by the 
Bell.
But all those priceless cameos dont redeem

most familiar faces cant rise above poor char
acter development. Nobody is given 
much time for the audience to 
understand them; the most 
enjoyable presences in 
the movie are the two 
children in the family 
with whom Dickie 
stays. Jon Lovitzs 
struggle is a pain 
to watch, which 
was very disappointing, 
because he is 
usually a great 
character actor. 
The writers did 
not give him any
thing to work with. 
David Spade is his 
typical irritating, 
abrasive self - until the 
films second half. And 
therein lies one of the more 
peculiar aspects of this movie.
Paramount PicturesDespite its many problems, 
Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star 
is not a complete waste of time. David Spade 
is, heaven forbid, charming and enjoyable to 
watch in the second half of the movie, after he 
decides to give back to the family that is host
ing him. Its good to see him play a role a little 
different from the standard David Spade 
character, a sarcastic jackass with no compas
sion or empathy. Once he drops the pointless 
slapstick and vulgarity from his act and con
centrates on interacting with characters, he is 
actually fun. Spade is a fairly skilled character 
actor; usually his problem is that his writers 
arent good enough. When they stop trying to 
make jokes, Spade can let his ability shine 
through.
Fans of Happy Gilmore will probably enjoy 
this movie. It has the same mix of gross-out 
jokes, slapstick comedy, and unending vulgar
ity, but it also manages to retain that charm 
which made Happy Gilmore such a popular 
movie. Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star offers 
the same quirky brand of fairly simplistic 
entertainment, wrapped in a typical, smarmy 
lesson that everyone can use nonetheless: put 
people first.
As any satirical meditation on celebrities 
would, this movie relies heavily on cameoIiHM RSMxd0B:p sSM05E RaHnndE0atE
HOROSCOPES.
BY DINAH WINNICK
ARIES (March 21- April 19): While the belief that, since chocolate is a bean, it
must be high in protein, may seem like a logical progression, it will quickly spell
failure for your otherwise promising body building and underground boxing career.
TAURUS (April 20 - May 20): Just remember, you've had little 
Clucky since her long-ago hatching in your kindergarten's incu
bator. She's had a long and fulfilling life and will be watching 
out for you from above, flapping away madly so as not to fall out 
of flightless bird heaven.
GEMINI (May 21 - June 21): The following trees will not toss 
branches at your head tomorrow: oak, pine, palm, pear, and 
maple.
CANCER (June 22 - July 22): Your CIT student status 
will become painfully obvious when, in the one human
ities class you've ever taken, you announce that the 
Kremlin was the actual home of the Gremlins, though 
the movie was probably filmed in the U.S. due to cost 
and security considerations.
LEO (July 23 - August 22): You can think of your obstacles as stepping stones, 
or giant granite blocks distanced so far apart that Superman couldn't jump them 
even with rocket booster boots powered by the pure, refined hope and joy of first 
graders at a marshmallow factory.
VIRGO (August 23 - September 22): Be thankful for the 
restraint of the person standing next to you in line when you 
decide to select a new ringtone on your cell phone and he 
refrains from grabbing the phone, driving to the nearest 
meat processing plant, and shoving it into an industrial 
beef-grinding machine.
LIBRA (September 23-October 23): Tomorrow is an auspicious day for you aca
demically, meaning you will actually wake up early enough to go to class. 
Congratulations!
SCORPIO (October 24 - November 21): This evening you will make the mistake 
of reading the ingredients of your pre-grilled veggie patty, dramatically increasing 
the volume of your compost heap and the availability of the storage space in your 
freezer.
SAGITTARIUS (November 22 - December 21): Mistaken iden
tity or not, you'll have a hot date to a $1 campus movie this 4 
weekend and that's what's important!
CAPRICORN (December 22 - January 19): After years of being 
too embarrassed to ask, you will finally look up "lentil" in the 
dictionary and be sorely disappointed.
AQUARIUS (January 20 - February 18): You will promptly forget the name of the 
next revolting entre you order, which happens to be the same one you ordered 
last time and detested, prolonging a vicious cycle of food dissatisfaction.
PISCES (February 19 - March 20): You will barely escape certain death when, 
after extensive sleep deprivation, you fall into a day-long, minimally conscious 
state, your roommate carries you to a hospital, and doctors inadvertently discov
er an infection on your elbow that could have spread throughout your body and 
caused your cells to hiccup loud enough for your heart to start freestyle beat box
ing.

_food o_______
Home on the range
Sometimes, nesting is more of a diversion than a necessity
Its been observed many times before, but for good reason: the kitchen is more than just a room for making dinner, 
byi a room for all kinds of sharing. Next door, the dining room is a social arena that imparts a convivial sense of ful
fillment to the people who meet there. This satisfaction certainly goes back to the old hat notion of food as spiritual 
as well as physical nourishment, but cliches like this have stood the test of time for good reason. Its no coincidence 
that every Easter, Thanksgiving, and Christmas at our house begins and ends in the kitchen, with a trip to the dining 
room in between. Long before dinner is served and after the plates are cleared, family members linger there to talk. 
And any day of the week, I could show up to find my mother leaning against the kitchen counter, carrying on a phone 
conversation, my father at the adjacent dining room table, reading a car magazine. These are the spaces of the fami
ly, unlike the bedroom that offers sanctuary or the living room that welcomes company. For my whole life, and for 
many others', the kitchen and dining room have housed a comfortable reality, pleasant refuge in familiar faces and the 
unconditional feelings of love that we share.
Now, however, for the first time in my life, I find myself with my own modest apartment, somewhere off-campus, 
but not quite home. My roommate and I are now solely responsible for making this space fit for human life, recreat
ing old, familiar parts of our lives on this clean canvas. So arises the urge to domesticate and pad the nest with spoons, 
knives, and forks. Instinctively  before I got a desk to work on or even a bed to sleep on  I had already equipped 
the kitchen with a spice rack, potholders, and two framed pictures of apples, stocked the refrigerator, and filled the 
cabinets with pots and pans. In my earliest memory, I am playing with my brother Chris in our homey, chestnut-pan
eled dining room, and I imagine that years from now, my first strong memory of this apartment will be set in the 
kitchen. I will remember the way my roommate disabled our fire alarm after I continually set it off while grilling chick
en. Consider it a christening  our apartment had its baptism by fire.
Though it could still use a few ancillary pieces, like a coffee table here or houseplants there, the rest of the apart
ment is also falling into place; we even made art for our walls, and I have adopted two hamsters, Mickey Finn and 
Maxwell Edison, as our household pets. Our dining room, though, remains our original and favorite meeting place. 
Any time of day, we sit there to talk, study, or watch TV, to experience this fresh but already familiar room as our lives 
unfold before us. By day, my beautiful placemats are covered in bills and papers, commonplace but extraordinary evi
dence that we live here and leave our things in our world as we please; by night, we share microwaveable dinners and 
munch bags of popcorn over their glossy tops. I have overlooked their price and I am forgetting their newness, as we 
are wearing them in, to define a small part of our space and our lives. In this murky land between adolescence and 
proper adulthood, they help me remember where I came from and make me think about where Im going.
It was a strange thing 
to^do. Though just the 
previous day I had 
refused to invest more 
than ten dollars on a bed
side table at Ikea, I hap
pily pushed my credit 
card across Kitchen 
Wizards glass countertop and signed my name 
to a $19 bill. Now  for 
more than I earn in a 
couple of hours of sling
ing cappuccinos  I am 
the proud owner of two 
laminate placemats, each 
embellished with a strik
ing iridescent thistle 
design. In the buzzing 
fluorescent light of a new 
apartment, still crowded 
with half-unpacked card
board boxes and not yet 
fully furnished, my 
placemats sit sturdy, 
bold, and elegant, lend
ing truth to the clich 
that the dining room and 
kitchen are the heart of a 
house.

Weekly inspiration from the ominously brooding pond
On one particular Sunday afternoon, the drakes were playing their 
games, showing off to the pretty females. As usual, Rupert was not .
invited to play their games, and he was left on the edge of the pond 
to watch and sulk. While paddling about aimlessly, berating himself I
for being such a loser, he bumped into another duck. He was going 
to apologize profusely and head the other direction, but he looked up and saw the 
prettiest face ever. Amy the Duck had come over to see him, and she was smiling. The 
games and conversations all stopped around them, and every duck on the pond began 
to fidget. But Amy and Rupert could only see each other.

Comickaze:
Losing your favorite series
It happens all the time, but that does
nt make it easy. Youve been reading a 
series and enjoying it. The characters 
are intriguing and their personalities 
are distinct. The action, romance, and 
interactions are great. But then you 
find out the bad news. Maybe you hear 
it from a friend, or maybe you read it 
on the Internet. Even worse, maybe 
you travel all the way to the comic 
shop just to find out that this months 
issue is the final episode.
Recently, I found out that three young 
titles Ive been reading since their first 
issue will end within the next few 
installments. Each series has its own 
unique circumstances for cancellation. 
Therefore, these three tides make an 
interesting case study for why a comic 
book might suddenly cease to exist.
The end of a series is always hard on 
the diehard fan, and he will go 
through a sequence of emotions after 
first learning his favorite comic will 
end. The diehard may find himself in 
denial of the shocking news at first. 
Anger at the company, creators, and 
unsupportive readers may slowly take 
the place of the initial denial. This
anger will transform itself into frustra
tion as the diehards realize they are 
nearly helpless to bring back the 
comic. Finally, acceptance will surface. 
But there is no rule to how long it may 
take this acceptance to arrive; some 
diehards will live with a grudge for 
many years.
Least emotionally affected by cancella
tion is the casual reader, who, unlike 
the diehard, will simply move on and 
concern themselves with the titles that 
arent being cancelled. But even casu
als are bound to be disappointed by 
the cancellation of a comic book 
theyve been following. In a perfect 
world, we would all react like the casual
But love and hatred are human traits, 
and for some, comic book cancellation 
can tap into emotional extremes. The 
anti reader is the one who truly ben
efits from a series cancellation. This 
reader has most likely been posting 
outrageously negative comments 
about a series and its creators on 
Internet message boards. They may 
even have a copy of the comic fixed to 
their dartboard and use the title for 
target practice  though they have
been reading it all along anyway. Each 
of these anti-behaviors is unique to the 
individual, but one thing is certain: the 
news of termination will be good news 
to an anti-reader.
Wildstorm Comics released the final 
issue of 21 Down this month. I was 
shocked to learn months ago that, as 
good as the series was, its sales were 
consistently weak. Then, this summer, 
writers Jimmy Palmiotti and Justin 
Gray announced several of the new 
projects they have planned for 2004. It 
was only a matter of time until 21 
Down was terminated, and I took the 
news in stride.
Sleeper, another Wildstorm title, has 
been struggling to find its niche in the 
comic shop audience. Creators Ed 
Brubaker and Sean Phillips are at their 
finest under the title, but sometimes, 
boasting quality work is not even 
enough to save a series.
Its been announced that Sleeper will 
go on hiatus indefinitely, with no date 
given for the busy creators return to 
the title. In other words, Sleeper is 
cancelled until further notice.
Marvel Comics The Crew was a new 
title only on its fourth issue when can
cellation was announced. The comic 
has only begun to introduce its full 
cast, and now it has only three more 
issues to bring closure to the plot. Poor 
sales and uninterested readership are 
the cause of termination. The talented 
writer of The Crew series, Christopher 
Priest, may have the industrys highest 
record of heartbreaking cancellations.
I had a large personal investment in 
The Crew, so I received the news of its 
end much like a diehard. Acceptance 
has yet to arrive.
Each comic book is different, meaning 
that each set of circumstances behind 
cancellation will remain unique. In the 
same vein, each reader is different and 
the news of cancellation will have dif
ferent effects. Its never easy to lose a 
beloved series, but cancellation can 
never take away the issues that have 
come before. Plus, it the series was 
good enough, it may return. Even XMen was cancelled at one point.

Depression
Is it a problem for you or someone you love? 
You're not alone. According to the National 
Institute of Mental Health, during any oneyear period, 18.8 million Americans-one in
10 adults-experience depression. Andrea 
Fagiolini, MD, is conducting a research 
study at the University of Pittsburgh Medical 
Center to examine the effectiveness of an 
antidepressant medication for major depres
sion. You or a loved one may qualify if you:
* are age 18 to 60
* feel depressed and anxious
* are either antidepressant-free or taking an 
antidepressant that is not helping
As part of the study, participants will under
go psychological assessments and receive 
medication. The medication to be used in 
this study has been approved by the U.S. 
Food and Drug Administration for major
