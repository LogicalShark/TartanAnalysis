TARTANS HANDED THREE DEFEATS
ON EASTERN TRIP____
TO W. POINT, N.Y.U. AND C.C.N.Y.
Plaid Lead West Point in 
Early Part of First 
Period
FOULS ARE COSTLY
Both C. C. N. Y. and N. Y. 
U. Lead Throughout 
Contests
High hopes entertained by Car
negie cage fans for a successful in
vasion of New York fell flat with 
the defeat of the Tartans Saturday 
night by New York University, mak
ing the third defeat suffered by the 
Skibos on their eastern trip. West 
Point handed the Tartans a 49-29 set
back Wednesday afternoon by rally
ing in the second half to overcome 
a lead of six points held by the 
invaders in the first period. New 
York City college, following the cxample set by Arm}', downed the Car
negie basketecrs 45-28, and N. Y. U. 
following suit, sent them away with 
the undesirable end of a 42-21 tally.
West Point Game 
The Tartans jumped into the lead 
at the start of the West Point game 
.and at one time held a lead of six 
points. Man to man defense was used 
in place of the zone system which 
the Skibos have been using extensive
ly this season. . The Plaids also tried 
to re-enact the Penn State game by 
freezing the ball, but with little suc
cess. Most of Carnegies points were 
accounted for by a forward to for
ward play which ended by tossing 
the ball to a guard under the basket. 
Merten, playing center, staged a fine 
performance, getting the tip-off quite 
regularly and also working well on 
the defense. Captain Nease shot five 
baskets and four fouls. The team 
as a whole -showed fine form, es
pecially in the first half when' the of
fense worked smoother than ever be
fore this season. Drugcr, o.f West 
Point, was high scorer with 22 points.
C. C. N. Y. Game 
The C. C. N. Y. game proved to 
be more of a combat than a contest, 
41 fouls being called. The Plaid pas
sers were outclassed from the start 
by the clever City collegers. Ex
cept for the early part of the sec
ond period, when the Tartans staged 
a strong rally and came within nine 
points of the Metropolitans score, 
the C. C. N. Y. tossers had little 
trouble in downing the Plaids. 
Carnegie was especially .weak in

Mechanicals Get 
Testing Machine 
Of Special Design
An interesting tool-testing and 
wear-testing machine is now being 
installed in the Mechanical Engi
neering Laboratory. It is of the 
type developed by Dr. Moses 
Spindcl in the testing department 
of the Austrian State Railways at 
Innsbruck. The particular unit now 
in the process of setting-top was 
constructed by the Maschinerfabrik, 
Augsburg-Nuernberg, and was 
imported from Germany by the 
Schloemann Engineering Company 
especially for installation at Car
negie Tech.
The forces exerted by the blank 
upon the tool by the wearing 
pieces' on the wearing disk are 
recorded autographically on strip 
charts.
The machine is adaptable to a 
wide range of testing. In addition 
to the work with cutting tools it 
can be used for wear testing, that 
is, for determining the resistance 
,io wear or rate of abrasion of 
metals or of road materials; for 
determining ' coefficients of friction 
as related to speed, and for study
ing lubricating properties of oils 
and greases. Iii fact, it is expected 
to prove a very versatile piece of 
equipment. v
Since many of ^ils parts are very 
delicate the machine was placed 
in the glass-enclosed room at the 
west end of the aeronautical labora-.. tory.
During the last year a large 
amount of new equipment has been 
installed in the combustion labora
tory in the sub-basement of Machinery Hall.
A surface , combusion gas-fired 
furnace fitted with a Duraloy re
cuperator was erected and piped 
up. Both are donations. The 
furnace was given by F. W. Manker, 
M.E., 1912, while the recuperator 
was donated by the Duraloy Com
pany. A fuel oil tank, a fuel oil 
pump, and a fuel oil burner were 
installed for use in the combustion tunnel.
Rev. Owen D. Odell Will 
Speak In Chapel Today
The Rev. Owen D. Odell from 
the Presbytgrian Church of Sewickley will be the speaker at 
the chapel services held' in the 
Little Theater today at 12:30. 
The Rev. Mr. Odells subject 
has not yet been announced, but 
it is sure to be of interest to 
all the college students. The 
program, which is being spon
sored by the freshman class, in
cludes as soloist, Walter Sickles 
of the Music Department of the 
School of Fine Arts, and Marion 
Soady, organist.
The remaining chapel services 
will all be in charge of various 
organizations on the campus, 
that of March 25 being under 
the supervision of the Y. W. 
C. A. According to the usual 
custom, cliapcl will be discon
tinued after Easter, and it is 
hoped that all the students will 
make a special effort to attend 
the remaining prc-l^aster serv
ices.
NEW 1929 THISTLE 
OFFER MADE 10 DAY 
AND NIGHT STUDENTS
Attractively Low Price 
Brings Book Within 
Means of All
There arc now on hand at the 
Student Council Office about one
hundred copies of the 1929 issue
of the Thistle which . are being
offered, for. sale at the low price
of $2.50. The sale was opened 
February 14, to members of the 
Class of 1929. Letters were sent

payable to Student Council, Car
negie Institute of Technologj'. The 
number of books is limited, and 
orders will be filled in the order 
in which they arc received.
The 1929 issue of the Thistle is 
an exceptionally fine one, judging 
from the enthusiasm with which 
it was received by the student 
body last wear. Probably its most 
attractive feature, aside from the 
usual pictures and write-ups, is the 
group of charcoal sketches of views 
of the buildings. The Thistles are 
offered at this unusual price in 
order that they may be disposed 
of immediately.

dance. The Womens Junior Prom 
is the first Carnegie dance to be 
held in the Urban Room.
One of Pittsburgh's most.famous 
orchestras has been engaged to

We All Are Playing Parts
Is Gist Of Granvilles Review
We are all always playing 
parts, announced the versatile ac
tor, V. L. Granville, in his recent 
dramatic interludes, and the part 
we play, contrary to public opin
ion, is determined largely by our 
associates and our aims' in life. 
The harassed news reporter, he 
said, knowing that it is his duty 
to accost the speaker off-stage for 
the purposes of an interview, will 
endeavor to assume a pose, some
what unconscientiously of coursc; 
that will elicit favorable replies." 
It was doubtless a bit disconcert
ing to the originator of the above 
daring statement, ylicn we ai rived 
at the feet of the idolsans part 
and sans posebut none the . less' 
determined to wrest from him a 
few of the ideas which seemed to 
periodically emanate from him.
His statement that all students 
should be obliged to have dram
atic training was questioned at 
first, but by reason of the fact 
that we are all playing said parts, 
it is to our advantage to act them 
in the most. effective way possible. 
All. the theatrical gestures, impedi
ments of speechin the way of 
fish bones and the like, or such 
unavoidable vocal / errors as stut
tering or stammering are eliminat
ed, and the individual who emerges
may not enunciate his consonants 
with\ the rhynithic twang and rcverbancy of an Arts graduate, but 
he will have had enough training 
to enable him to defeat the wily 
sales-girl, the soap-box orator, or 
the Presbyterian elder who argues 
tc favor of predestination . . .
He announced that the talkies 
will eventually develop into fins 
art, although they will never reach 
the artistic pinnacle which drama 
may achieve, for a player can in
stantly sense his audience when he 
says his first few lines, and in
stinctively iodifics or gloriously 
smashes all previous eloquence un
to the end of the story. The ap
peal of a talkie to the public is a 
definite one, although it is already 
crystallized in form and appeal be
fore it is shown, and no amount 
of displeasure or amusement can 
alter the story. These same talk
ies will soon eliminate the custardslinging melodramatic farces that 
infest our movie palaces at pres
ent, for they are rendered doubly 
odious when the rasping voice of 
the heroine, amplified, sounds like 
: much grinding machinery set
in motion, and when a fond em
brace, intended by misguided di
rectors to be the tender symbol of

Plebe Promenade Brings Out Much Freshman Talent
Last Tuesday the freshmen were 
given the chance .to - demonstrate 
their ingenuity in t|)e first rpviyal 
of the Plebc Prom that has btjcii 
held for two years.
At noon that day the plebes don
ned their amusing and somewhat 
grotesque costumes and appeared at 
their various assembly rooms where 
they passed in review before an 
astute body of judges consisting of 
the three upper classes. The prize 
winners were picked in each school 
and then the entire group met in 
front of Arts school and marched 
in grand parade behind a clown 
band.
The promenade ended in the 
gymnasium where a final grand 
march was held. Following the re
view the prize winners were award
ed their prizesthe much coveted 
exemption cards from freshmen 
regulation.

MR. BOWERS TO TALK 
AT Y.M.H.A. ON TUESDAY
Next Tuesday evening, March 4, 
Claude G. Bowers will lecture in 
the Morris Kaufmann Memorial 
Auditorium at 115 South Bellefield 
avenue. Mr. Bowers topic Thom
as Jefferson and Religious Freedom 
is one which should prove to be 
of great interest to Carnegie stu
dents, in view pi his wide exper
ience in the political world and
his ability as writer and lecturer.
At present an editorial writer for 
tl.e New York Evening World, 
with an enviable record of politi
cal activity, Mr. Bowers is emin
ently qualified to explain many 
political problems of the past and 
present. He has been long asso
ciated with the Democratic party, 
particularly in Indiana, his home 
state. lie gave the keynote ad
dress at the National Democratic
Convention at Houston, Texas, in 
1928, and hasserved on innumer
able committees associated with
the work of his party.
Equally impressive is his work 
in the spheres of journalism and 
writing. Before serving on the 
World, he was an editorial writer 
for the Indianapolis Sentinel, and 
the Terre Haute Star. He was 
formerly editor of the Fort Wayne 
Journal Gazette. He is 'unusually 
well acquainted with political his
tory and his written many books 
dealing with political affairs of the 
past, including, among others, The 
Party Battles of the Jackson Peri
od and The Struggle for De
mocracy in America.
Y. M. C. A. Forms Freshman Cabinet At Dinner Meeting
Last Tuesday evening ten fresh
men -attended a dinner meeting 
given by the Senior Y. M. C. A. 
Cabinet, for the purpose of form
ing a Freshman Y. M. C. A. Cab
inet., Mr.- R. V. Davis, secretary 
of the Carnegie Tech Y and 
Alexander Orr, president of -the 
Senior Cabinet, were in charge of 
the dinner and meeting.
At the meeting following the 
dinner, President Orr outlined the 
program of the Senior Cabinet for 
the rest  of the school year, and 
stated that the Freshman Cabinet 
would help ifi carrying out the 
proposed plans. He said that the 
F/eshman Cabinet was being form
ed ' for the purpose of acquainting 
the freshmen with Y. M. C. A. 
work, and of helping to create an 
interest in the work done by the 
Y. M. C. A. on the campus. Mi. 
Davis mentioned that one of the 
duties of the Freshman Cabinet 
would be to help increase the at
tendance at chapel exercises. It is 
hoped that the freshmen will take 
a greater interest in the. cliapcl 
exercises, for much effort is being 
spent to make the programs inter
esting as well as educational.
At the close of the meeting, Mr 
Davis announced that there would 
be a joint dinner and meeting of 
the Y. W. C. A. Cabinet, the Sen
ior Y. M. C. A. Cabinet, and the 
Freshman Y. ,M. C. A. Cabinet this

LARGE ATTENDANCE AT 
INTERFRATERNITY BALL
The Intcrfraternity Formal held 
at the Hotel Schcnley last Friday 
was the best attended of any of 
this years school dances. A larger 
crowd than was expected attended. 
It was estimated that there were 
about 440 couples at the dance. 
The affair was the peppiest of any 
this year. There was no grand 
march and the dance was carried 
through very well without it. The 
gold cord chokers given as favors 
were considered the most sensible 
favors that have been given in a 
long time.
The best of music was furnished 
by Dick Wolf and his Scarlet Mask 
Orchestra from Ohio State. The 
major factor in the success of the 
dance was the unceasing pep dis
played by the orchestra. It was 
the consensus of opinion that tlie 
Scarlet Mask was the liveliest or
chestra that lias played at any Car
negie dance this year.
The Schcnley Hotel ball room 
was appfopriatcly decorated with 
the banners and insignia of the 
fraternities on the campus. Fol
lowing the precedent set last year 
corsages were not in evidence at 
the Intcrfraternity Ball.
Following the dance about half 
of the fraternities entertained at 
their respective houses with break
fast parties. The popularity of 
breakfast parties after major school 
functions is increasing among the 
fraternities.

Stephen Phillips Ulysses* 
is Next Production 
of Drama Dept.
FOUL OSARE COTY
Matinees Will Be Given on 
Friday and Saturday 
of This Week
A production of Ulysses, a play 
by Stephen Phillips, directed by 
Professor Chester Wallace, head 
of the Department of Drama, and 
presented by the students of this 
department, will open in the Little 
Theater on Thursday evening' of 
this week at S:30 oclock.
This play is being given in place 
of a Greek tragedy since it has 
been the custom to, present one 
drama of this nature annually. It 
isa dramatization of the high 
points of the Odyssey" and one 
of the most ambitious works of its 
kind that has ever been attempted 
by a modern. The fact that it is so 
Stupendous makes it favorably for 
production by the department since 
it offers ample exercise in every 
branch of theater. Certain liber
ties have, of necessity, had to be 
taken with the plot sincc^it would 
be impossible to include in a drama 
all the incidents of the "Odyssey." 
On thissubject, Mr. Phillips says: 
In this authors mind all these 
liberties were an essential part of / 
his dramatic scheme;' nor can the/ 
ne<d for similar liberties be welf 
escaped by any practical play

Welding And Pipe 
Bending Classes 
Held On Saturday
Two Saturday morning classes, in 
which welding and pipe bending 
arc taught, have been organized 
by Professor Dibble of the Heating 
and Ventilating Department, as a 
result of his activity in the exten
sion of plumbing and heating data 
and practice. There , are approxi
mately 100 students in the two 
classes.
The establishment of these courses 
culminates Professor Dibbles work 
of the past two years in teaching 
the steamfitters of Pittsburgh the 
skill of welding to be used in 
their work. Although it is generally 
acknowledged that welded joints 
arc better than those screwed, the 
steamfitters have demurred because 
learning to weld means learning a 
new skill without additional pay. 
Professor Dibble, however, finally 
has succeeded in convincing the 
men that his method, welding, 
should be used.
The J. C. Paulus Company of 
Philadelphia recently loaned the 
Welding Department a complete 
set of German-made welding torches 
and tips. These torches differ from 
the standard American torch in that 
the acetylene and oxygen are mixed 
in the shaft instead of in the head 
of the torch. The new tip gives 
it a circular flame and the whole 
outfit is immune from backfiring 
and freezing. The mechanical con
struction of the torch prevents 
backfiring when the velocity of 
backfiring is greater than the ve
locity of flow, and it prevents 
freezing of the flame due to ex
pansion of the gases caused by the 
heat of the flame.

PAGE TWOT'TE CARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY, FEBRUARY 25, 130.
THAT LITTLE EASTERN TRIP into A1 Smiths State 
and Uncle Sams and Jimmy Walkers towns didnt pan out so 
well. The Armys 40-29 win and the 45-28 and 42-21 victories of 
the College of the City of New York and New York Univer
sity, successfully repulsed' the Plaids little invasion. None ot 
the games were interesting, from the Carnegie viewpoint, unless 
it be the C. C. N. Y. game. ...That contest was marked by its 
rcBemblance to a first class school boy fight, no less than 41 
fouls being called by Referee Silverman. Apart from that there 
is little to sayunless it be about the games of this week.
Saturday evenings game with Geneva will mark the close 
of this seasons schedule, but first comes the tussle with the 
1,rides and joys of the University of Pittsburgh tonight on our 
own playground. Capn Charlie, First Mate Baker and their 
crew are scheduled to put in an appearance for the finale of the 
village championship scries. If the standing was even it each 
team had won one contestthe game might prove interesting. 
As the standing is not even the game will be interesting just 
the same. If memory serves us right, the Golden I anthers ot 
the University of Pittsburgh, who have triumphed over the 
Plaid of Carnegie in ea^h.of eight straight games and whom 
the aforesaid Tartans have not defeated since the season ot 
*26-,27, had a hard time of it during the last game in the Car
negie gym. Before we go any further, we wish to state that we 
have learned tlie above little speech by virtue of having seen it 
printed in the local scandal rags each day for weeks and weeks. 
Evidently, those newsmen seem reluctant to grant us even the 
privilege of starting the season with a clean slate, bless their 
hearts. To go on with the story, we play Pitt tonight and if 
voti have ever seen a Pkt-Carncgie gamenuf ccd.' j * + * *
THE PLEBES TANGLED UP with Kiski last week and 
came out second best, 29-25. Tonight they play the preliminary 
game with the Pitt Freshmen. On Saturday they, too, close 
their season, engaging the Reserves from Geneva College.
* * * *
WITH BOTH THE VARSITY AND PLEBE teams play
ing away from home last week the Intra-Mural leagues swung 
into action. Twelve hard games were fought, four in each of 
the National, American and Federal leagues. Its too early, as 
yet to predict who will carry off the trophies, but just ask any 
fraternity or dormitory man and he'll be glad to tell you that 
there is only one team who can possibly be champion. After 
you have determined the victor, all twenty-four of them, come 
around to the gym and see the ganics^-thcy arc interesting.* * * *
THE VARSITY SWIMMERS were nosed out by the 
Franklin and Marshall team last week, 39-27, but the Plebes 
were victorious, 38-28, over Allderdlce High. This was the first 
'Plebe win of the season. May many more follow!

IF YOU HAVE READ the swimming story, on this page, 
you have been told that admittance to the meet is free. This 
is true, but, as in other cases, free with the coupon. Bring 
along ticket number 14- for the W. & J. meet on Friday night 
and number 16 for that with the University of Cincinnati on

Kiski Prep School League Basketball
Defeats 33 Quint By 29-25 Count
The Carnegie Freshman suffered 
their second defeat of the season 
at the hands of the strong Kiski 
five last Friday when, they journey
ed to Saltsburg to get the small 
end of a 29-25 score. The prep 
school lads led throughout the 
contest with the exception of. a 
few minutes early in the game. 
Near the end of the game the 
Plebes staged a sensational finish 
and threw a real scarc into the 
Kiski lads.
The game started slowly with 
neither team able .to penetrate their 
rivals defense. The scoring started 
when the Kiski boys tallied' on a 
foul. Their lead was short lived 
however for the Plebes counted 
from the floor and went into the 
lead 2-1. Another foul tied the 
count .' and then the Black and 
White' five stepped into the lead 
never to be headed. For the re
mainder of the half the teams 
battled on fairly even terms with 
the Kiski boys holding the advant
age at half time, 13-10.
During the third quarter the 
Saltsburg outfit played rings around 
the Plebes, the prepies fouling re
peatedly in their attempts to put a 
halt to the scoring orgy. During 
the closing minutes of the quarter 
the Plaid rallied, but were trailing 
26-18 at the end of the period. At 
this' point Siegle broke loose with 
some fancy mid-court sharpshooting 
and was chiefly responsible for the 
score being 27-25 with a minute to 
go. Th<}n Hill, a substitute for the. 
prep school five, put the game on 
ice by sinking a field goal with 
only a few seconds to play remain
ing to make the final score 29-25.
Although the game was not a 
rough one, an unusually large num
ber of fouls were committed. The 
surprising number of 35 free throws 
were granted during the evening 
with each team counting 11 points 
from the foul line.
Tonight the Plebes tangle w.ith 
the Panther yearlings in an effo/t 
to break their prolonged winning 
streak which has reached the sur
prising total of forty. The Plebes 
arc conceded more than an even 
break since they lost to the Pitt 
outfit by a one point margin in the 
first game of the season and have 
since improved considerably. Satur
day the Plebes ring down the cur
tain on the current campaign when 
they tangle with the Geneva Re
serves, another team that handed

Last Monday marked the opening 
date in the Intr-.-Mural basketball 
leagues. Twelve games were played 
last week, four in each league. Most 
of the games were close and hard 
fought, showing that the race for the 
cup will be closer this year than ever 
before. Th ty team which showed 
a marked superior performance over 
its rival was the Beta Sigma Rho 
quintet which succeeded in defeating 
the A. T. O.s 33-12. Not all the 
teams have played as yet, but by the 
end of this week all the teams will 
have seen some action. The only 
match' which did not cotnc off as 
arranged, was the game between the 
Phi Kappa Psi and t*  Beta Thetaii 
Pi; the Phi Psis did not show up; 
consequently they lost by' a forfeit,

Lose Interesting 
Contest To F. & M.
Aquatic minded students were 
treated last Friday to a well handl
ed meet which captured the dttention of some 200 spectators from 
start to finish. Franklin and Mar
shall emerged victors over the var
sity with a score of 39 to 27. All 
raccs were won by a mall margin 
and a good time, and the final out
come of themeet was always in 
doubt. Each of Riscdorphs men 
gave a satisfactory performance, 
but the Lancaster splashers, by 
more efficient paddling, succeeded 
in sinking a majority of the places. 
Which all goes to prove that well 
known axiom . . . in a cigarette its 
taste! ... in the water its 
SPEED!
Easier, in fine form, (took his us
ual first place in the diving.  Fuller 
followed with a third in this same 
event. Hoar, -of F. & M., was the 
star of the meet, taking firsts in the 
50 and 100-yard free style and 100- 
yard back stroke. Ellispulled a 
surprise in barely nosing out Sangster in the 200-yard breast stroke 
first place went to the former.
The end of the pool presented a 
colorful sight. It is here that the 
entrants warm the bench until it is 
time for them to dash off a couple 
of lengths. In the meantime they 
wear such a combination of towels 
that could easily be used in a bar
ber shop except for the varj'ing 
shades of blue, green, yellow and 
white. Referee and starter, Henry 
J. Blum, was well within hearing 
range with his six shooter. His 
target score was not computed, and 
each blank cartridge left no doubt 
as to when that race began. Mr. 
F. Moses assisted in the capacity 
of head judge.
Plebe element was made preva
lent by the presence of several score 
pupils of Allderdice High School. 
Our freshmen pulled through on 
the heavy end of a 38 to 28 score. 
This constitutes the Plebes first 
victory in many years, and is a 
result of good coaching of fair ma
terial. Coulter led the scoring with 
firsts in the 50 and 100-yard free 
style.
There will be four dual meets 
next week end. Present yourself 
at 8 p. m. on Friday, February 28, 
to witness the varsity meet with 
W. & J. and the Plebe meet with 
Langley High. By higher mathe
matics we should drown out W. 
& J. with a small margin, for the 
latter was recently beaten by F. 
& M., 45 to21. On the following 
afternoon' vfe will play liOStto the 
mermen from the University of 
Cincinnati, and in conjunction the 
Plebes will swim against Kiski.

3 p. m., on Saturday, and as usual

W. A. A. MEETING
Last monday evening a very important addition was made to the 
W. A. A. constitution which has to do with the selection of board mem
bers. Women .who .have shown particular interest in the promotion of 
Carnegie sports.were selected dircctly by the board as desirable man
agers of sports.
The present board, believing that the women athletes of Carnegie 
should have some voice in the selection of their managers, worked out 
a satisfactory plan which was formally adopted, last week to go into 
effect at once.
Before the end of each sports season, on the day designated by the 
manager, each woman w-lio has taken part in the sport will hand in her 
nomination for the next years manager for that particular sport. The 
women with the three highest votes will be regarded as formal candi
dates for the position. These candidates, to which the board may add 
its nomination if nccessary, will be voted upon by the board in the 
regular spring election.
Two elections for candidates for managers of swimming and basket
ball will take place within the next few weeks. Every^ woman should be 
thinking about some one whom she considers an eligible and desirable 
manager.
SWIMMING
The swimming meet will take' place on Thursday, March 6, at 4:30 
p. m., in the pool. Each woman is permitted to participate in three 
events. Only those women who have attended the required number of 
practices are eligible to partake in the meet. To obtain swimming team 
points, a woman must enter the meet. The list of events for the meet 
are as follows:

attendedto play on their class team. During the following week, 
whichis the first week in March, the intcrclass games will be played.

frUESDAY, FEBRUARY 25, 1930.. THE CARNEGIE TARTANPAGE THREE
A SECTION OF THE TARTAN 
DEVOTED TO THE 
NIGHT STUDENTS^Ibe Carnegie flMaib
PROMPT RETURNS FOR 
N. S. C. DANCES ARE 
REQUESTED.
Believe it or notharbingers of 
spring have been seen on the Cam
pus. Did I not sec the girls from 
N{.- M. roller skating on the dis
used driveway intersecting the 
Quadrangle the other evening? 
Then again, I saw some of the 
boys from the Frat Houses flying 
. kites,, think of it, flying kites, on 
the vacant space paralleling the 
walk familiarly know as The Cut. 
Truly these are the forerunners 
of spring1. I would not be at all 
surprised to sec some of the boys 
shooting marbles, or the girls 
skipping the rope, which all goes 
to show that we are never too old 
to play.
Speaking of roller skating on this 
forbidden driveway, I dont sec 
why they arc permitted to use this 
sanctum for is this not a menace 
to pedestrians, and arc. they not 
adding to the hazards which one 
meets with while on the Campus?
I was certainly pleased to see 
the last issue of' the Plaidboy 
Ill tell you it was a humdinger, 
as the youngster says. I dont see 
why this section of the Tartan 
cant be like this always. It can't 
be because of lack of material, I 
am sure, as this bunch of campus 
tenants always seem to take a 
great deal of interest in their ac
tivities. Register one vote from 
me for a continuance of a larger 
amount of reading material.
A pleasant suprisc in this issue 
ivas the reappearance of the Book 
Review. Although it appears to be 
"Vignetted, it is still interesting 
and I dm sure other night students 
will enjoy reading it,' and mayhaps 
from time to time we will have 
more space available so that E. 
DeL. can enlarge on this work of 
his. At all events heres hoping.
I see the True Lover number 
of Puppet is scheduled' for issue 
this' week. If it is anything like 
the last issue, it will surely be a 
good number. By the way, it 
would be interesting to know how 
many of the night students really 
patronize this Campus publication. 
I often see those energetic night 
salesmen offering this monthly for 
sale, and commensurate with their 
efforts a large number should be 
sold. This leads to the question 
How many of us really appreciate 
their efforts to supply us with a 
good college humorous m<?nthly? 
Tf 3'ou havent read a number, just 
buy the next one and I am sure 
you will becomc a regular sub
scriber like I have.
True Love number of Puppet will 
be out this week. All night sales
men are requested. to report; at the 
Student Council room for their copies.
This is a very good number and 
night students arc urged to patronize 
the night salesmen for their copies.
Practical Subjects In 
Night College Courses
There seems to be a general 
trend away from the standardized 
curricula offered by the average 
college under existing conditions 
according to numerous articles and 
references in daily papers.
It appears that subjects that are 
of nonpractical value to the student, 
that is, have no bearing on his 
future wage earning power, are 
falling into disrepute. The general 
outcry is for what might be called 
ca'feteria colleges, and prep, 
schools too, wherein the average 
student, who will some day-depend 
solely upon his own salary for 
maintenance, can lake just those 
subjects he needs to aid him in his 
chosen work, and this without the 
necessity of fighting through a ver
itable bag of prerequisites.
The real truth of the question 
dependslargely on the institution 
or college under discussion. The 
average collegc is troubled with an 
overflow of applications, and must 
do something to cut down the 
classes to a manageable enrollment. 
But this is an over-done point. By 
regulating the inflow of first year 
men following classes in the Sopho
more, junior, and senior years 
would automatically regulate them
selves, obviating the necessity for a 
continuance of this practice for the 
number of advanced standing 
students is few.
Then again, the average course 
is arranged to give sufficient credits 
to the student to enable him to go 
into thepost graduate work en
tailed in obtaining a degree. While 
it is only just that degree men 
should be well acquainted with a 
large amount and variety of associ
ate knowledge, both in their own 
line and in a general way, it would 
be dccidedly better to cut abstract 
math.,- foreign languages, and other 
subjects in the case of the man 
who wants to know, .only the 
necessary material.
It.is not any sordid moti've that 
causes one to search for only that 
knowledge which is necessary. In 
the case of night students alone,- 
we are interested in getting'a'max
imum practical grasp of a subject 
in a minimum space, of time. We 
are, as a rule, not far .enough.:ad
vanced, in our work to need; any. ..of 
the material that we haveJiobintcrest in, but must take to enable.-us 
to carry something else we do 
need.
One of the articles mentioned 
above was written by a man who 
claims thirty years experience as 
an engineer. He writes that he 
had two years of German in a 
prominent university, and now 
would be pressed to ask for a bag 
of pretzels in Hamburg. His 
article, while farfetched at times, 
carried food for thought especially 
for those who have neither the 
time nor the money to spend years 
at college, in so far as he gives a 
very comprehensive list of objec
tionable subjects, among which 
higher math, leads the list, and 
"cramming foreign languages 
comes second.
In closing he asks a question 
In other words, why are the mil
lion and one things which are well 
worth learning sidetracked to make 
place for the abstract math., for
eign languages and other things 
which are neither cultural nor of 
practical use?

LOOKERS
Printing Dept. Has 
Large Night Enrollment
With second semester registra
tion figures about complete, the 
fccords show that the Dcpartfnent 
of Printing in Industries has a 
night enrollment that compares 
favorably to that of other years. 
Every branch of study in the de
partment have night classes, sev
eral classes being enrolled to the 
capacity of the equipment available.
A perusal of the figures show 
the total enrollment of night students to be 125, of which 88 are 
first year students, 15 two-year, 14 
three-year, 4 four->ycar, 3 five-year 
and one student who has been 
studying for six years. The day 
school enrollment in the depart
ment is 77.
. Jt is interesting to note that 
among the night students no less 
than forty printing firms are represented which exemplifies ilie ambi
tion and sacrifice of the average 
worker to better himself on his 
own time that lie may be more 
valuable to his employer and, incidently, to himself. Many print
ing students spend much of their 
time commutting between home 
and school. The chief offender in 
this respect is a young fellow who 
for the past three years has come 
from New Castle three and four 
nights per week.
Several women arc enrolled for 
courses in this department, show
ing that the fair sex is not with
out its ambitious members who arc 
willing to pass up a date with the 
B. F. that they may acquire a lit
tle technical knowledge of their 
work.
The Plaid has recently received a 
rather odd request, but after con
sideration, it appears to be a good 
one, so avc arc publishing it.
There are quite a number of 
night students who have withdrawn 
from their courses so far during 
the year. A goodly number of 
these students had secured lockers, 
but since they are not now in 
school, these lockers are not serv
ing them. There are a number of 
night students who desire lockers, 
but the supply docs not exceed the 
demand, therefore there is a short
age. f
Our proposition is thisif the 
students who have withdrawn will 
return their keys they will be given 
a receipt, and this in turn will 
make available to other students 
the lockers which , they arc not 
using, and will relieve the shortage 
which exists and give the new stu 
dents an opportunity to secure a 
locker.
The Locker Key Room is open 
each evening from 7 to 9 and will 
be glad to receive the keys to the 
lockers which arc not in use. . We 
hope a large number of night stu
dents will respond to this request 
and return their keys so that ad
ditional students can be served.

SOME FACTS ON 
THE LIFE OF 
LEONARDO DA VINCI
Leonardo Da Vinci was born it} 
the year 1452. There were three 
great Italians: Michael Angelo, the 
master of power uid strength in all 
arts; Raphael, master of beauty and 
artnony in painting, and Leonards 
Da Vinci, master of thought and feeling.
Of the three, Da Vinci readied 
farthest into the future, for he stood 
fo.- more than a mastery of arts. 
He was a universal genius who made 
important investigations in the fields 
of geplogy, geography, and astron
omy; hr* painted pictures which arc 
universally hailed as unsurpassed, 
even in the age of giants; and he 
planned great engineering feats to 
control the courses of the Arpo 
and the Po Rivers. He also per
fected many practical inventions.
The personal charm of young Da 
Vinci was in keeping with his _brilHaul mind. As he went about the 
streets of Fforence in his rose-colorcd 
clonk, his golden hair falling about 
his shoulders, his sketch book hang
ing from his waist, he was a strik
ing contrast to the crowd that fol1o\ved him.
Unlike most great masters, of paint
ing Da Vinci left few of his works 
unfinished. He was one of the best 
known men of the world. The Mona 
Lisa, a portrait in oils, and the Last 
Supper a large wail painting in dis
temper . (colors mixed with water 
soluLle medium) arc his two best 
known works.
Mona Lisa also called La Gio* 
conda is the most famous portrait 
in the world. Against a fantastic 
background of rocks and wafer, Da 
Vinci painted a face that has been 
a theme of endless discussion. The 
1 'cture of. this* Florentine lady has 
lost the wonderful red of the lips 
and the rose like-quality of the skin, 
but the sl.immcr of the mouth, the 
wonderful enigmatic smile,, and the 
beautiful hands are almost unspoiled 
by the lapse of years. This picture, 
the pride of the Louvre Museum in 
Paris, was stolen from its gallery in 
1911. Two years later it was found 
in the possession of an Italian in 
Florence, and was restored to its 
place in France.
It is said that when Leonardo 
was painting his fanious portrait of 
Mona Lisa, which occupied him for 
four years, he kept some one con* 
stantlyr near his model to sing, play, 
jest, or otherwise amuse her, that 
she might continue cheerful. This 
proves beyond doubt the fact that 
Da Vinci never tired of studying 
expressions of the human face. Even 
grotesque expression fascinated him.
He died in 1519.

Three Kinds of Colleges in America?
The learned Edward Wilbur Berry, dean of John Hopkins 
University, says in the American Magazine: We may have to 
recognize the advisability of having three kinds of colleges in 
Americaone for the sons of the" rich, and well-to-do; another 
for the drifters, those who dont know what they want, and a 
third for bright boys.
The worth of such a plan is undeniable, for having separate 
types of colleges for each of the above clearly defined classes 
would certainly eliminate much of the intellectual and financial 
waste in colleges of today. Too much time-is spent.in trying 
to teach the intricacies of psychological logic 'to collegians 
whose most strenuous day-time efforts arc devoCed to the task 
of getting enough sleep between Proms. It would be much 
better to instruct the sons of the rich and well-to-do in the art 
}f balancing the tea cups and climbing up telegraph poles in 
roadsters with an unusually tough course in Chapel thrown in 
to remind them that they arc enrolled in a collcgc.
More difficult would be the problem of building a school 
Cor drifters, unless something on the order of the Floating Uni
versity would be tried. A solution of the problem would be the 
formation of a national Drifters College association with 
branches in all principal cities. Each drifter student would buy 
a book of tuition tickets good in any course in any school in 
the association. Of course semesters would have to be short
ened to a month so that the drifter might pass a few courses 
before the urge to drift came on. Some of the courses that 
could be taught might be: Ten ways lo ask for the price of a 
cup of coffccor The application of Calculus to the selling of 
hosiery.
The curriculum for a collcgc for bright boys would depend 
upon the definition of the words bright boys. If by bright 
boys is meant those who eventually write for the American 
Magazine, it would be necessary to * install a system of oldfashioned water-pumps on 'the campus, for skill in going 
through the watcr-pump motions is essential for success in later 
life. However, if by bright boys is meant those who can show 
their professors a trick or two in any subject, the collcge cur
riculum would be easily planned. In addition to the fairly diffi
cult subjects now given, these students could take physical 
training from the Physics department and consider humanistic 
courses as,extra-curricular work.
Of course, there would be some difficulty in classifying 
some young men into the various groups, because in rare in
stances there arc bright, rich boys who drift, but this problem 
should be easily solved by some of the educators who show ad
mirable skill in the classifying and grading of their students.

17 and will continue through Feb
ruary 28 in the Department of Ar
chitecture on the fourth floor of 
Arts Building. These problems 
have been submitted for judgment 
and prizes to Beaux Arts at New 
York by  schools of Architecture 
over the entire country. After 
judgment is passed on them, the 
best ones arc sent to different 
schools for exhibition.
A plan of a modern stadium, 
submitted by a student of archi
tecture at the University of Illi
nois, was given flic first medal. 
Ail Emerson prize of $50 was won 
by a light and sound problem that 
ingeniously combined lighting ef
fects and sound amplifiers, Two 
modern renditions of restaurants 
built out over Wafer and several 
designs  of bus terminals received 
honorable mention.
According to a questionnaire sur
vey made by P. E. Lull of the 
Public Speaking Department at 
Purdue University, 70 per cent of 
the employers questioned arc favor
able to men with debate experi
ence. and 20 per cent ar indif
ferent on the matter. The remain
ing 10 per cent consider public 
loquacity no attribute of their pro
spective employes.
We have attained success. Some
one has written a letter to us. 
Weve printed a part of it, omit
ting, naturally enough, the most 
intimate details. It follows:
Dear "From the Fence/' Jr.
As one \yho is interested in 
raising journalistic standards, allow 
me to say that you arc turning out 
to be not such a bad columnist. 
Now that Half your column is 
"Random Thoughts and Shots, or 
whatever you call it, its getting to 
be right interesting. No doubt by 
the end of the semester this fea
ture will comprise the whole of 
From the Fence and then there's 
no telling whats in store for you.
Even the best of columnists, how
ever, as we learned from bitter 
experience, suffer at times from 
poverty of material, so we will 
stretch this epistle to its greatest 
possible length, putting in all the 
two-bit words that we can think of 
Another one of your stellar quali
ties is your undying fidelity to 
your friends, fraternity brothers and 
department associates. This is in
deed admirable even, or perhaps 
particularly, in a columnist as most 
of the brotherhood take delight in 
panning or otherwise rendering un
comfortable their intimates and ac
quaintances. You had better watch 
out, though, as you are danger
ously near the point of becoming 
well-liked, and popularity is fatal 
to columnists. Columns can be 
popular and successful, but column
ists never can get that subtlety.
I his is just about enough pat-or 
matcrn criticism and advice for one time,
Yours,
I'rom the Fcncc, the First.* * * *
J lie time has come when the 
fraternity pins, which have come 
through the present school year 
unscathed, are in greatest danger. 
In other words, spring i.s here. 
Spring makes people do many, 
many things. In the first place, 
everyone knows just where the 
young mans fancy turns, and, if 
he looks toward a dorm girl, his 
mind doesnt get a chance to turn. 
She twists it all around for him. 
In the olden days, naturalists tell 
us, spring made the sap come out 
of the trees. Now she makes him 
come out of the fraternity houses. 
The walks in Schenlcy Park arc 
more crowded than the Carnegie 
Grille, while the well-known circle 
on top of the hill resembles the 
local campus at night as far as 
automobiles arc concerned. But 
love isnt the only result of the 
return of the annual balmy days .with their balmy affects.
Spring gives the campus collegiatcs a chance to take the moth
balls out of the pockets of their 
knickers and don those gaudy con
coctions called sweaters, which 
were purchased by someone in 
some weak moment. The prize this 
year for the first daring splurge 
goes lo George Suitt, who walked 
into the Tartan office Friday with 
a costume which looked as though 
a dozen eggs had had a fight with 
a bottle of ketchup. Hut Gcorgip 
isnt the only one. He ,is only set
ting a precedent.
The coming of spring is always 
heralded by the Womens Junior 
Irom. In last weeks ordeal, we 
told how, when a young lady be
comes a Junior and goes to tea 
dances, she waits. In the case of 
the Prom, the, shoe is on the 
other foot. Every boy, man, or 
Dragon, who has. ever spoken to 
an uppcrcla'ss lassie is ou pins and 
needles. Junior and Senior girls 
who have received any undue 
amount of attention shouldnt feel 
too Mattered. They should read 
the writing in the skies and re
member the future.
AJl in all, spring brings us many 
things, and it wontbe long until 
the Prince will be with the milk
maid, the sopromorcs have com
plete possession of the Senior 
Fence, and the freshmen will have 
complete possession of the Sophomores.* * * *
Random Shots and random 
thoughts. The annual inter-frater
nity push .ball contest is over. It 
was a howling success. Maggie 
Murphs and dramats are all at the 
Penn this week. Pittsburghs Own 
Flaming Youth, Lcgrande Cuthbertson, better known as Teddy Joj'cc, 
is with, us again, but happy to re
late, he leaves Saturday. Doris 
Mather wont stay out of print. 
The Mellon Hall midget put on a 
spring dance on the front lawn 
one night last week. If Murray 
Arncmtrout and Hook Sample 
couldn't resist climbing aboard 
strange automobiles in winter, 
we wonder what spring will 
bring forth? J. Koltcr Ziegler 
of wapakoneta, Ohio, who. claims 
to have only a passing interest'in 
Mellon Annex. Well, from where 
we sit, the little boy is a long way 
from flunking. The latest thing 
among the Senior Commercials is 
the Kambach act. For particulars, 
see Bob Wright. We understand 
that the Carnegie Tartan hit 
Wellesley with a rush last week. 
Ask .Loxtcrman. The Tartan staff 
has presented the Fcncc with a 
pair of car mud's which are sup
posed to keep his cars from burn
ing when people, talk about him 
on the campus. There must be a 
reason. If these plebc bits of 
femininity don't stop sending i: 
puns on football players, well 
call out the militia. Katherine 
Wholcy crashed through with 
Andy, Yerinan awful fix. Miss 
Wholeys phone number is Ma. 
SI 10, ami we dont blame you.
Cluck! Cluck!

will soon be ancicnt history.

courses.

ing.

dates.

much as sophomores ones.

grass.

structor is dangerous.
That a nonfratcrnity man is out 
of it.
That the Arts girls get more 
dates than the Maggie' Murphs.
That no one knows all the stanzas 
of Alma Mater.
That there arent enough scats 
in the Little Theatre.
That some fraternity house cel
lars smell like breweries.

undying affection, re-cchocs to the 
farthest corners with the volume 
of a chair being drawn over rough 
cement, and \.ith the hiss of a 
thousand snakes in captivity. Then 
it is that romance flics out of the 
window, and is replaced by gross 
melodrama.
Granville is optimistic as far as 
the future of drama is conccrned, 
for the public taste is rapidly un
dergoing refinement. The number 
of those who .;tand in line to sec 
King Lear and "Hamlet, now 
equals that which stands in the 
alley of the burlesque shows ' and 
Wild West episodes. In time, he 
confidently hopes, there will be no 
line at the last-named resorts. And 
although we feel that this is a bit 
to  much to expect from human 
nature, Mr. Granvilles optimism 
arid enthusiasm arc laudatory, and 
we hope they may be rccognizcd.
His dramatic interludes were 
doubly interesting when he ex
plained that it was necessary to 
do in the five minutes all.oted to 
each interpretation what another 
(and, we suspect, a less gifted)
actor would have the entire eve
ning to do. He must exaggerate 
greatly to get his conception of 
the character across to his audi-. 
erice, and yet must guard against 
the possibility of grotesque per
sonification. He is working under 
a fiercer and more intense strain, 
and yet he must succeed in pro
ducing the same effect. The pur
pose of everyone appearing in publit is to entertain, unless he be 
a didactic individual who insists on 
debating formally, or making tedi
ous after-dinner speeches, to the 
everlasting boredom of all the un
fortunates doomed to listen on for
feit of their good standing in the 
community 1 .
His philosophy could probably 
be  summed up in the few words 
 do a little, and do it well, if his 
performances were any exemplary 
indication to the outside world. 
Suffice it to say that he delighted 
all his audiences to the nth de
gree of pleasure.
