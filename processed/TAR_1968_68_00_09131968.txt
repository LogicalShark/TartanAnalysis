TheWayYouDoTheThingsYouDo
By Wm. McClosky
Like all of the other organiza
tions on campus, the TARTAN 
wishes to extend a sincere wel
come to this years freshman 
class. Unlike many persons or 
groups who have already greeted 
you in the first few days of your 
college experience, your campus 
paper is in a position to render 
some really useful information.
The class of 1971, may look for
ward to an academically stimu
lating and socially satisfying four 
years. As you may know, there is 
a wide range of social activities 
available on campus. These in
clude a full intramural sports 
program, Homecoming and Spring 
Carnival weekends, productions 
by the Carnegie Drama Depart
ment in the Fine Arts Theatre, a 
weekly film series and the fra
ternity and sorority systems.
Aside from the many and var
ied opportunities on Carnegies 
campus which you will soon dis
cover for yourselves, students 
have a chance to find their fun 
in the immediate surrounding 
area as well. CMU is centrally 
located among four other major 
universities, three of which are 
within a fifteen minute walk from 
Skibo. Chatham College, a liberal 
arts institution for women, is ac
cessible from either Fifth Avenue 
or Wilkins Avenue. The girls at 
Chatham sponsor many dances, 
mixers and similar events during 
the year to which Carnegie men 
are always welcome.
Further down Fifth Avenue to
ward downtown is the University 
of Pittsburgh, distinguished by its 
forty-two story Cathedral of 
Learning. The largest institution 
of higher learning in the Pitts
burgh area, Pitt boasts a total of 
over twenty thousand. Carnegie
Dean Wells talks with newest class.
students a^e w'elcome to use the 
new Hillman Library by Forbes 
Field, the pool tables in Schenley Hall, the many cafeterias and 
lounges which dot the campus, 
and Treise Pool, part of Pitts 
very modem and complete phy
sical education facilities. Panther 
Stadium, near the gym buildings, 
is the home of both the Pitt Pan
thers and Pittsburgh Steelers foot
ball teams.
Still further along Fifth Avenue 
is Mount Mercy College. A Catho
lic institution for women, the 
Mount is noted for its nationally 
famous glee club which presents 
school year. A full schedule of 
a number of concerts during the 
mixers begins September 20th at 
St. Josephs Hall with J. C. and 
the Silver Strings to which all 
Carnegie people are invited.
Duquesne University, the fourth 
and n*ost distant institution, is 
located on Forbes Street near the 
city jail. In addition to a full cal
endar of mixers, workshops and 
lectures, Duquesne also sponsors 
the Dukes, one of the nations 
leading college basketball teams. 
An old and well-established insti
tution, Duquesne is presently un
dergoing a rebirth in the aca
demic and social spheres. Many 
new and exciting buildings have 
cropped up on the hillside cam
pus within the last few years, 
the most interesting of which is 
the Student Union on Vickroy St.
The spring the gaily flowered 
Camp-Bus Coach hit the streets 
of Pittsburgh. For a fare of ten 
cents, students may ride this re
modeled bus which circulates 
every half-hour among the Car

Its A Live-'In
By Dave Kamons
Life in the Mellon patch can be laughs if it is 
taken for what its worth. Babysitting the books is 
the kingpin of the university Thing. The Thanks
giving Present, known to the millions as MidSemester Grades, gently but firmly drives the 
point home. Dedication to academics is fine; com
pulsion, like Saturday night studying, is definitely 
uncool, and those who do without undue pressure 
(frinstance being flunked out and draftable) are 
often scorned as Nurds by their peer-group. 
The students who best keep their sanity are those 
on to the many little things which keep college in 
perspective. Theyve been around, know the ins 
and outs; for those who dont there follows a 
micro-list of whats happening.
Naturally every guys first thought is the girls 
in Morewood Fortress. If you know somebody 
who doesnt think like this, cool it and keep your 
door locked. There are all kinds of little problems 
in logistics involved: having no car, no money, 
and/or no names, addresses and phone numbers 
being most common. The coin problem is strictly 
your own. The others can be solved with a little 
ingenuity. Transportation problems are eased with 
the help of Pittsburghs Finest Bus Line. Oakland 
(go to Warner Hall, turn left, keep walking) is 
only a stroll away. Shadyside, Pittsburghs own 
Village (?) and Squirrel Hill also make a con
venient walk. Theres nothing like a quiet stroll 
to establish that vital rapport.
Finding a girl requires more ingenuity. The 
Orientation Committee provides the initial push 
with the Freshman Mixer. Failing there (guys do 
outnumber co-eds by about 3 to 1) a guy can 
turn to dorm mixers, dances at Pitt where there 
are some 7,000 women, nursing schools, and two 
girls colleges. The man with real guts may even 
pick a phone number at random from the C-Book 
and take his chances. The entire procedure isnt 
necessarily recommended, but anything is better 
than cuddling with a Calc book.
The girls have it easy. All you have to do is sit 
back and wait for the phone to ring. In an average 
evening there will be about fifteen minutes total 
time when someone isnt already on the phone, 
giving something like a one-in-twenty-five chance
of a call getting through. And there are fraternity 
mixers, and all those evil, evil fraternity men 
perched like vultures across the street. If you 
really want to be well-known on fraternity row, 
dont close your curtains; formula guaranteed not 
to fail.
Privacy on a date is number one premium. 
Donner and Morewood lounges are comfortable 
and nice in an institutional way, but theyre fish
bowls. The obvious solution is Schenley Park. On 
a warm, dry evening turfing under the stars and 
the smog is great. You can also see the muggers, 
the dirty-old-men, and the friendly policemen who 
clear the place out after midnight.
Curfew at Morewood is the best time of all. 
No girl should miss the hundred yard dash to 
the sign-in book. It keeps you slim and is very 
beneficial for general physical fitness. Its a natural 
way to build hearty lungs and strong legs. After 
one semester a regular participant should be in 
fine shape for field-hockey or basketball.
The most popular feature of curfew time is the 
traditional Super-Kiss. Starting time is shortly 
after the five minute warning rings. You must see 
this in person to appreciate it; no description can 
do it justice.
The prime center of activity during long year 
is Skibo snack bar. The name of the game is people 
watching. The straight crowd goes there to watch 
the hippies and wierdos. The turned-on group 
meets to communicate, relate, and look at the peo
ple looking at them. Like any sport at this analy
tical school, people watching has been reduced by 
the dedicated to a science. There is the main floor 
watcher who usually sits near the counter at the 
edge of the balcony so he doesnt miss anything; 
the back-corner-second-floor-eatcher who comes 
to meet his own clique; the lobby watcher who, 
under the cover of a book, tunes in to scraps of 
floating news and snatches of music from Lobby 
Folk Singers.
The total scene can go on forever: TGIF on 
Skibo Patio, underground flicks, even demonstra
tions (once there was a demonstration of a potato 
slicer that doubled as a flashlight you could save 
50c on if you mailed your order now) . . . But 
the real scene is more the attitude than the action. 
Everything has the potential for being ridiculous. 
Get involved, but occasionally step back, realize 
what youre doing, and laugh.

coach stops for CMU students at 
the corners of Forbes and More
wood avenues and Margaret Mor
rison and Tech streets.
As well as being the home of 
three of the citys universities, 
the Oakland area is also the cul
tural center of Pittsburgh. Car
negie Museum and Library is just 
three blocks away on Forbes St. 
The library contains two million 
volumes which may be borrowed 
free of charge by students upon 
receipt of a library card. The 
museum displays artifacts and
