194! Rubber
Ball Is Here!
Scat Davis Plays 
At Dorm Dance
Newest of all campus dances is 
the Mens Dormitories Spring 
Dance this Friday night. Only a 
year old,, this dance, Its a Rub
ber Ball, has become on of the 
prominent affairs on the Tech 
campus.
Taking a cue from the other 
big dances, the Dorms have 
signed a name bandJohnny 
"Scat Davis and his orchestra. 
Departing from the precedent set 
by the other dances, the Dorm 
dance will be strictly informal, 
thus encoiiraging a greater at
tendance among all the students.
Excepting Spring Carnival, the 
"Rubber Ball is the only other 
dance which is held in the Mens 
Gym. The dance will last from 
nine until one. Dormitory men 
are admitted free of charge on the 
basis of the activities fee that they 
have paid. Make no mistake; this 
dance is as much for the rest of 
the campus as for the dormitories. 
Non-resident students can secure 
tickets, costing only $1.25 ad
vance sale, from Jere Keiser, 42, 
chairman of the dance, or any 
member of the Claymore Clan. 
Tickets at the door will be $1.50.
According to Joe Tuchman, 43, 
decorations which are centered 
around the theme, Its a Rubber 
Ball, will rival Spring Carnival 
in extent and originality. The new 
public address system will be used 
for the first time in the Mens 
Gym.
Johnny Davis brings his band 
to Carnegie from HoDywood where 
he became the Toast of the Movie 
Colony. Formerly, he was a 
headliner with Fred Waring. After 
being featured in the Waring 
movie, Varsity Show, he signed 
with Warner Brothers, appearing 
in a number of pictures, before 
organizing his band.

New Comedy Op ens April U
The Comedy of Errors, short
est of all Shakespeares plays, will 
be the next production in the Lit
tle Theatre. The play directed by 
Mr. Boettcher, will run from April 
5 to 8 and April 15 to 19the 
break being due to the Easter re
cess. There will be three matinees 
on April 5 and 19, at 2:30, and 
April 18 at 3:30.
This play was made vaguely 
familiar to the public by the 
movie The Boys from Syracuse, 
a musical comedy version. It is a 
farce of mistaken identity. Tfre 
plot revolves around the reunion, 
after a long separation, of An
tipholus of Ephesus and his serv
ant, Dromio of Ephesus, with their 
twin brothers, Antipholus and 
Dromo of Syracuse.
The method of single-casting is 
again being used. The cast is as 
follows: Duke, Richard Rose, 43; 
Aegeon, Richard Aiken, 41; An
tipholus of Ephesus, Marvin Einhorn, 42; Antipholus of Syracuse, 
Roland Kraus, 41; Dromo of 
Ephesus, Thomas Jones, 43; 
Dromio of Syracuse, Robert Challener, 42; Balthazer, Henry Barn

Come on studentsone and all! 
Bring your parentsbring your 
friendsand show them just what 
Techites can do. Remember the 
Sing and Swing is less than two 
weeks awayon Friday, April 4.
There will be various changes 
in the program this year. Most 
important is the three group plan. 
Last year, there was a great deal 
of controversy over the fratern
ities competing with nonGreek groups. It has been decid
ed that the best way to settle the 
matter is to award a separate cup 
for any other mens group who 
wishes to enter the contest. This 
attitude was taken as it was con
sidered only fair that anyone who 
wished should have a chance in 
this competition.
Another change in the rules is 
that the singers may have an ac
companistthis is not compul
sory.
The Sing will start promptly 
at 7:30 and the Swing, featuring 
Len Malverns orchestra, will be 
from 10:00 to 1:00.
The tickets, if bought together 
for both the Sing and the Swing, 
will cost $1.25 a couple. If they 
are bought separately, the Sing 
will cost $.25 per person and the 
Swing $.75 a couple.
All groups participating in the 
contest must file their entries by 
March 28that includes the 
names of their songs, the names 
of their singers, and the entrance 
fees.
Tech Debators 
Lose to Pitt 
And Grove Cityj
Previously undefeated, Tech's 
Debating Team finally succumbed 
to Grove City and Pitt in a de
bating tournament at Grove City 
last Saturday afternoon.
This was made possible through 
a set of peculiar circumstances. 
Tech sent two squads to the meet: 
one composed of Cleo Bateman, 
John Horth, Joe McCandless and 
Wayne Johnson; while A1 Mar
tin, Ed McGehee, Dick lrw.in and 
Boti Dietrich made up the other 
one. The first squad lied their 
opponents but the second team 
dropped one match. The Tourna
ment Committee decided to aver
age the records of both squads 
together in order to determine 
Techs standing and so robbed 
our debators of a perfect season.
In spite of the loss at the meet 
last Saturday the Plaid arguers 
have enjoyed a very successful 
season, one that should make 
every loyal Techite proud of 
them. To bear out this statement 
look at their record ior last week. 
On Wednesday members of the 
squad were actively engaged in 
three contests. Ed McGehee and 
A1 Martin defeated the Womens 
Team from Penn State. While 
they were doing this another 
team was defeating Mt. Mercy 
and still another, Dick Irwin and 
Bob Dietrich) was out-debating 
the men of St. Vincent.
On Thursday Cleo Bateman 
and Wayne Johnson won out in 
a panel discussion with t seVen 
other schools. The meeting was 
held In Margaret Morrison and 
Wayne was the chairman. Then, 
on Friday night, Jack VanArsdell and Wayne Johnson debat
ed the Penn State Team and won 
another. Throughout the past sea
son our debators have appeared 
in over thirty matches with over 
twenty-five other schools. They 
have ven broadcast over the ra
dio.
Dr. Lawler, English professor, 
is in charge of the group.
Street Car Poll
Returns of the street car ques
tionnaire which appeared in the 
TARTAN two weeks ago are as 
follows:
1. I usually travel to and from 
school by street car100.
2. I do not use the street car 
now, but would if fares were re
duced153.
3. I do not use the street car 
and would not even if fares were 
reduced7.
In this trend towards the in
creased use of street cars if fares 
were reduced, Tech agrees with 
the evidence collected from Mt. 
Mercy* Pitt, Duquesne and PCW. 
Although many of the students 
did not vote, the poll indicates 
that a lower street car rate would 
be favorable to the company.

Techs annual fashion parade is 
one that attracts everyone who is 
interested in following the course 
of college styles. It is always held 
in Kaufmanns eleventh floor au
ditorium on three successive af
ternoons. This year it will take 
place this Thursday, Friday and 
Saturday at two oclock. There 
may possibly be one evening 
show for business girls and oth
ers who could not otherwise at
tend.
The setting will not be, as it 
was last year, the campus. Just 
exactly what it will be or how 
the themeto emphasize color 
will be carried out is not to be 
known until the day of the style 
show itself. The costumes will, 
however, be presented in a se
ries of episodes. Kaufmanns will 
award a merchandise certificate 
to each girl whose outfit is vot
ed best in her group by the au
diences of all four performances.
Since the girls, under the di
rection of the Costumes Econom
ics Faculty, selected their own 
outfits, everything from bathing 
suits, shorts and robes, to a wed
ding dress, will be represented. 
Betty Shanor, a Junior in the de
partment, will be the bride In the 
patriotic military wedding. She 
will wear a white satin suit with 
pearl epaulettes and a short tulle 
veil, and Arthur Steele, as groom, 
will walk under an arch made by 
the swords of ten R. O. T. C, offi
cers. The latest available list ol! 
these men is as follows:

Talks at Tech
On April 3, Professor Arnold 
Wolfers J. U. D., Ph. D., L. H. D 
will lecture at two assembles on 
the present European conflict. 
The first assembly will be con
fined to the Sophomore Social Re
lations classes and will be held 
at 11:30 A. M. in 104 Industries 
Hall. In the afternoon at 4:30, 
Professor Wolfers will speak in 
the Little Theatre. This address 
will be open to the public in gen
eral.
Born in Switzerland, 1892, Pro
fessor Wolfers studied law in sev
eral of the European Universities, 
receiving his degree of Doctor of 
Law at Zurich, 1917. Professor 
Wolfers lectured in the United 
States in 1925 and was appointed 
Master of Peirson College, 1935, 
by the Yale University. Later he 
became professor of Internation
al Relations and in 1939, Yale ap
pointed him as a director oL' grad
uate studies.
He is the author of several 
books which are mainly in the 
field of economics. His latest book, 
Britain and France Between Two 
Wars, was published in May, 
1940.
Summer Session

Unique Invention 
Imitates Human 
Speech Sounds
Classes will be excused today 
from 11:30 A. M. until 1:30 P. M. 
to enable the entire faculty and 
student body to attend the Tau 
Beta Pi assembly at the Carnegie 
Music Hall.
The Voder, an electrical appa
ratus, the first of its kind in the 
world which creates human 
speech sounds, will be featured at 
this unique assembly as a part of 
a lecture-demonstration by Dr. J. 
Owen Perrine, assistant vice pres
ident of the American Telephone 
and Telegraph Company.
In his lecture, The Artificial 
Creation of Speech, Dr. Perrine 
discusses speech sounds and their 
basic elements, touching on the 
significance of the Voder as a step 
in serious telephone research.
Dr. Perrine joined the Depart
ment of Development and Re
search of the American Telephone 
and Telegraph Company in 1921. 
In addition to his development 
work in the field of electrical com
munication, Dr. Perrine became 
an editor of the Boll System Tech
nical Journal, which is devoted to 
the scientific and engineering as
pects of communication.
In 1927 he was tne representa
tive of the Bell company at the 
Worlds Congresses of Telephone 
Engineers and Physicists at Como, 
Italy. At the present time ho is 
on a tour ol! the country, lecturing 
on and demonstrating the Voder.
Invitations have boon sont out 
to a number ol high schools as 
well as the general public by 
Tau Beta Pi. Tomorrow the per
formance will bo repeated for the 
Pitt students; however, this latter 
assembly is being sponsored by a 
Pitt organization.
Following the locturo, Dr. Per
rine will be the guest of honor at 
a lounchoon for the faculty and 
the telephone company guests. 
The  luncheon Is being arranged 
by Dr. W. E. Hotchkiss, Falk Pro
fessor of Social Relations, and Dr. 
W. N. Jones, Director of the Col
lege of Engineering.
IRC To Discuss 
Plans for Peace 
Thursday Night
Much heat and a little light is 
being generated in the United 
States about our part in World 
War II, and one of the least dis
cussed and probably most import
ant considerations is the type of 
peace that we want to follow the 
War. Various groups, believing 
that we must decide upon a meth
od to achieve a lasting peace, have 
proposed their pet theories. One 
theory, which has been receiving 
a great deal of attention lately, 
is the plan for a union of western 
democracies, as proposed by Clar
ence Streit in his book, Union 
Now.
Since the International Rela
tions Club of Carnegie Tech has 
felt for a long time that these va
rious plans should be thought 
about now to avoid future errors, 
it has invited Mr. Norman Lyons, 
who is affiliated with the'InterDemocracy Federal Unionists, to 
speak to Carnegie Students Thurs
day night at 6:45 in the Carnegie 
Union. Mr. Lyons, who was a 
former superintendent of schools 
and a newspaperman, was closely 
associated with Governor Earle as 
secretary of the Milk Control 
Board. As Western Pennsylvania 
representative of the Federal 
Unionists, ho feels that their plan 
is a practical first step toward 
democratic world government, 
and the realistic way to end wars, 
prevent depressions, widen our 
liberties.
On The Record |
There will be np phonograph 
recital today at 12:30 because of 
the lecture by Dr. Perrine at 
Carnegie Music Hall.

In the adjoining column you will find a letter from Professor 
Borman 11. Dawes commenting on last weeks editorial. We sug
gest that you read it before going any further with this.
We can see 001 inconsistency in supporting the right of Spam 
and China to determine their own national destiny and suspecting 
the motives of the British and American Empires in the present 
war. Who can believe in democracy for the Chinese and Span
iards and acquiesce in denying it to the natives of India and to 
the South Americans!/ . . .The Spanish episode reveals that the British and American 
governments are not in the least concerned with democracy 
abroad for they deliberately betrayed the democrats who looked 
to them for support.J.)oes it puzzle no one that the South American dictators con
tinue to oppress their peoples with the tacit support of the United 
States? Does it puzzle no one that such great support for this 
democratic crusade comes from our undemocratic prejudiceridden South ?Churchill made a speech not so long ago in which he asked 
the Italian people to overthrow Mussolini. He did not tell them 
about the long years of oppressive fascism. He did not speak as 
the champion for the democratic rights Mussolini had taken from 
them. On the contrary, he shed nostalgic tears for the friend
ship  which only a few years ago existed between Fascist Italy 
and Democratic England. The crime for which Churchill asked 
the Italian people to punish Mussolini was the declaration of war 
upon the British Empire.
The history of Englands relations with Germany seem to in
dicate a similar attitude. There has been no real concern over 
what Hitler did to the German people, the Austrians, the Span
iards or the Czechs. Britains opposition to Hitler has been in 
direct ratio to his threat to her Empire.
Britain is warring, not against Hitlerism, but against Hitlers 
attempt to build a new world empire at her expense. There is a 
profound difference.
What have we to hope for as a result of this war besides tem
porary preservation oi: Anglo-Saxon financial dominance? We 
cannot restore pre-Hitler Europe. That democracy with its 
political corruption, economic insecurity, petty national jealousies 
and inability to deal with problems except by attempting to post
pone them, is dead forever. It was dead before it was nailed into 
the coffin by Ilorthy, Metaxes, Mussolini/ Schushnigg and Hitler. 
History saved France the embarrassment of a French fascism by 
having the Germans march in.
Europe after the war will either be divided into a host of 
states run by petty HitlersHitlers who will owe their positions 
to the goodwill of Britain and the U. S. and who will be no threat 
to these Empiresor Europe will build the society which Profes
sor Dawes calls the bright promise of our democratic order. 
But Professor Dawes Utopia (which we hope for as fervently 
as he docs) cannot be chained within the European continent. 
Like the great social upheavals of the 18th and 19th centuries it 
must spread to England, perhaps to the United States. To put it 
in a sentencethe New Democracy depends on .the willingness 
of the ruling classes of Britain and the U. S. to abdicate their 
position, to permit the extension of democracy, to permit a better 
ution of wealth. It depends 100 their willingness because 
0, . an starve a European social revolution as they starved the 
10 ii 0:vn social revolution in 1918.
That is why there are 001 war aims and there is no positive 
program for democracy. That is why dictatorships are found in 
tho crusade for democracy. That is why we wink at profiteer
ing and evasion ol! the labor laws and monopoly agreements with 
German industries and make much noise over pacifists and strik
ers. Professor Dawes bright promise and the present war 
have nothing in common.
That is why the demand for war aims is not in the least a 
tendency toward enervating passivity. On the contrary, it is a 
call to action.
Molding out the bright promise would shorten 1 lie war im
measurably forit would give Europe hppo in Hitlers defeat, and 
it would remove the cancers which now weaken our democracy. 
II; is so obviously the thing to do when fighting Hitlerism and so 
obviously the thing not to do when fighting for Empire.
We believe, as Professor Dawes does, that men must act 
against Nazism. We take the failure to state and demonstrate 
war aims as ample evidence that Britain and the U. S. are not so acting.
Lets llsivo VolisBg Machines
Last year Student Council failed to avail itself of an oiler 
of the free use of voting machines for the campus election. The 
result was an election conducted in chaos and an aftermath of 
bitterness and charges of cheating.
The plea of lack of time which was unfortunately so cogent 
last year will have no validity if Council acts now.
Suspicion of dishonesty has 001 place in a school election, and 
if voting machines will remove the possibility of such suspicion 
and expedite election procedure, let us have them.
Besides, weve always wondered how you work one of those new-fangled gadgets.

Dr. Dawes Disagrees 
With Tartan Editorialone of
To the Editor of the Tartan:
I wii.li to make a lew observa
tions about the tenor and the im
plications of your editorial Alter 
The War Is OverThen What?  
You make a strong point in your 
insistence upon a statement of 
War aims by the opponents of 
Naziism. The sacrifices, if such 
there are to be, are entitled at the 
very least to more than the belief 
that they stood against something. 
A positive statement would heart
en the already-conquered, and 
v/ould also rid us of fears and 
hesitancies. I also agree with your 
implication that there is much 
that is defective in our so-called 
democratic order.
While sympathizing with you 
to a certain extent, I must how
ever protest that your editorial 
would give comfort to Adolf Hit
ler. He could detect within it an 
inconsistency, a tendency toward 
enervating passivity, and evidence 
of intellectual bankruptcyall of 
which phenomena, incidentally, he 
analyzes in Mein Kampf as the 
cancers of democracy. The incon
sistency, at least by implication, 
rests in your support of democ
racy in China and Spain prior to 
1939 as set against your suspicion 
ol England at the present. Does 
the editorial not also reveal a pro
pensity of the liberal-minded to 
be so distressed over the deficien
cies of our system as to be blind 
to its possibilities for eventual 
good? And worse still, does it not 
fail to perceive within Naziism. 
the extirpation of the moral 
achievement of man? Were Hit
ler to triumph over Britain and 
thereby force us to arm ourselves 
to the teeth in order to survive, 
we would discover, too late, what 
Hitlers enemies had been fighting 
against. We have but to look at 
prostrate Europethe lamps of 
learning quenched, helpless min
orities barbarously mistreated,

The latest issue of Phi Kappa 
Phi, by dedicating its quarterly 
Journal to Tech, has awarded this 
school a unique distinction. This 
is the first time an issue has been 
wholly given over to the activi

which the Society attaches to the 
broadening of the engineering

Since the turn of the century 
it has become increasingly appar
ent that something must be done 
to remedy the chaotic state of so
ciety. In order to do this, econom
ists believe, with good reason, 
that industrial production must 
be made more efficient. This, 
however, can only be done by en
couraging science and engineering 
which in turn are rapidly in
creasing the complexity of social 
organization. To cope with this 
problem, Carnegie has initiated its 
course in Social Relations and al
tered its engineering curricula to 
eliminate specific handicrafts and 
emphasize a more fundamental 
scientific training. This was done 
so as to provide the engineer with 
a broader education so that he 
might more successfully attack 
the social problems.
The merit or this program may 
be attested to by the recognition 
which it has received from Phi 
Kappa Phi, as well as other or
ganizations. Phi Kappa Phi is a 
big brother to Phi Beta Kappa, 
recognizing and encouraging su
perior scholarship in all forms of 
university study, whereas the old
er society establishes chapters in 
none but Liberal Arts schools. The 
Tech chapter, one of the 44 
throughout the country, was es
tablished in 1933 and has since 
been very prominent. In fact it is 
the seat of the Central Office, and 
one of our faculty, Dr. L. R. Guild, 
is national secretary.
pies of force and violence, relig
ious tolerance and peace ridiculed 
as ideals of the pusillanimous. 
Men must act against Naziism, 
otherwise there will be. nothing 
left worthwhile to be for.
Because so many people in our 
country keep asking for war 
aims and a positive program of 
democracy, Hitler argues that his 
democratic opponents are intel
lectually bankrupt.. One does not 
have to look Jar to behold a bright 
promise even in our defective 
democratic order. Preserving all 
the good things which we already 
haveand there are manywe 
can and must, if we are worthy of 
our heritage, press forward to that 
happy day when democracy will 
obtain as the way of life the 
world over. Our definition and 
practice of democracy will then, 
if we realize our possibilities, be 
more than political; it will be ra
cial, economic, social, and spiritu
al. Minorities will dwell and wor
ship in peace. Wealth within and 
among the nations will be better 
distributed than /at present. Eco
nomic security for all social class
es will be the prime concern of all 
governments or of one world gov
ernment. Tension among social 
classes will relax and^ disappear 
because its causes will have been 
eliminated by experts in social 
relations. War, national rivalries, 
lynching, and persecution will be 
remembered as painful relics ol 
an age of barbarism out of which 
men had to struggle to the pres
ent life. This is a big order, Mr. 
Editor, and I can see you smile 
and hear your murmur, Utopia! 
What a dream! But I submit, in 
conclusion-, that such a dream 
could never come true under Hit
lers New Order. If Hitler has 
his way, it will be in large part 
because the peoples of the democ
racies were inconsistent, enervat
ed, and incapable of dreaming 
great dreams.
Very sincerely yours, 
NORMAN H. DAWES.
Mortar Board 
To Show Movies
Next Tuesday Mortar Board 
will present a comic movie in the 
Assembly Room of Margaret 
Morrison at both 11:30 and 3:30. 
The movie, free to students, will 
show some of the antics of peo
ple of by-gone days. Peanuts and 
popcorn will be sold during the 
presentation.
Mortar Boai'd has conceived a 
novel idea for its annual assem
bly program to be held in the near 
future. A movie on etiquette 
in color will be presented. Mr. 
Miller, professor of social rela
tions, will take the pictures of 
members of Mortar Board and en
gineers. A typical day on campus 
will be shown, divided into three 
sections: etiquette at the table, on 
campus and at social functions. 
The continuity will be provided 
by a commentator using the Pete 
Smith style.
Expenses for the two movies are 
being shared equally by the As
sembly fund and the Mortar 
Board Assembly. If it is a suc
cess, the Techetiqutte will be 
shown at the Mortar Board Na
tional Convention in June, and 
may be rented to other schools.

In Janet Levy we find a goodnatured miss with an irresistible 
sense of humor. Her cheery smile 
has caused many a freshman to 
think that Tech is not such a bad 
place after all. Jan uses much of 
her pep in supporting school ac
tivities and doing things up right.
Jans favorite hobby, time-oc
cupier, and diversion is sports. 
She goes in lor all sorts and kinds: 
skating and badminton. She has 
been W. A. A. tennis manager and 
is now president of the organiza
tion. Her field is not limited, how
ever, in that she can compete 
with any glamor girl on the dance 
floor. Her specialty is jitterbugging, and this not to a rhumba! 
At most any school affair you can 
find Jan doggiein on down. She 
was recently honored at the Mili
tary Ball by being chosen an Hon
orary Cadet, and says that this 
was her most recent thrill. We 
could name another: specifically a 
certain Johnny from Duquesne.
As secretary of the Newman 
Club for the past two years, Jan 
has done much to make the affairs 
of the club a success. She has al
so been a member of the C. W. 
C. A. cabinet in the past. The 
many. weekends she has spent in 
the woods on retreats hold a spe
cial place in her memory. She is 
a member of Gamma Phi Sigma.
The reason she is so much lun 
to talk to 'is her interest in her 
friends and the pleasure she gets 
from their successes. This is an 
idea that could be well copied by 
any one. She loves to wear sport 
clothes, says they are more com
fortable and wearable at all times.
the girls
. . . gRCN. cNBs
Her main regret is that she will 
have to leave Tech so soon, and 
say goodbye to the many friends 
she leaves behind her.
Jan hopes to obtain ajob as 
Social Worker when she gradu
ates. Considex-ing that she has the 
main qualities necessary for suc
cess, we are sure that she wall do 
so, so we say good luck to one of 
our popular seniors.

TUESDAY, MARCH 25, 1941THE CARNEGIE TARTAN3
w\ a swell tsst..  
K your teeth into 
RGFio3ACST

By Ruth Brodie
We arrived at a party the other night and found one of the
guests, in the middle of the living room, sitting under a sun
lamp in sunglasses and a warm stupor. We never indulge alone, 
hut just to be soeiahle, we had a go at it ourself. The next morn
ing, there were delicate patterns of night-club tan all over our 
face. Only it wasnt tanit was red. We filled in the glasses 
line with rouge, and now we look like the main course at Orvies 
Oyster Emporium.
We didnt think that two five-minute sessions under a sun
lamp would do that to us. Somehow or other, we cant believe 
those things, even when we see them ourselves. 
Freshman science instructors and our engineer 
friends puush us into a chair and patiently ex
plain how the molecules come out of the bulb 
and hit us in the face, but we dont believe 
molecules can get through a glass bulb. We 
couldnt, and were smarter than a molecule. 
And no matter how red we are, we still dont 
believe that a lamp can give you a sun-tan at 
two oclock in the morning.
Dont go by us, though. We dont believe 
radio, either. We think theres a symphony orchestra and Jimmy 
Wallington in that box.

Of all the people in the world, we love best the ones who 
write letters to the newspapers and to magazines. Not all of 
them, understand, but the chummy ones. Our dentist goes in 
for periodicals of the Bernarr McFadden sort, and we can always 
manage to forget what were going to have to go through by 
reading the Letters to the Editor while were waiting for him 
to kill off the patient ahead of us.
For some reason, the people who write to that kind of mag
azine feel as though theyve known it all their lives, and as if 
theyre on toothbrush-trading terms with the entire editorial 
staff. One little note Ave remember starts off, Hey, L*#***y. 
I dont get you! Hows come you pretend to be patriotic and 
then you hire Alphonso Crumb for your sports editor, when 
everybody knows that in 1914 he said to his wife,  dont know 
what this country is coming to. Explain that, huh, pal? It 
goes on to say something about, mHNIBN been buddies for a long 
time, but if you dont fess up, Im going to have to cancel my 
subscription.
We have a picture of the editors of L#***#y writing to Dor
othy Dix, asking her frantically how to avert this rupture of a 
beautiful friendship. %

We are beginning to get slightly irked at the service ads 
that are appearing in all the magazines. Its bad enough when 
cigarette companies try to make us believe that men in all 
branches of the service stop everything, in the middle of a 
crucial flight or gun practice or something, and start using 
government micrometers to show their buddies that the cigarette 
is bigger than any other cigarette. But when a tennis-gut con
cern prints a full-page add, saying that by playing tennis with 
rackets made outof their gut, you are keeping up the morale 
.of the nation, thats too much.
Were not saying anything about the defense program. Let 
Knudsen build all the airplanes he wants to. But, so long as 
the United States is listed in the files under D (for Democracy, 
silly), please let us choose our own toothpaste and our own tennis 
gut, without feeling that were fifth columnists for doing so. 
As a matter of fact, it might be a good idea to sell those ads to 
Obstreperous Adolph. Then, while the German Army is com
paring Cigarettes and stringing tennis racquets, the British can 
move in on Bremerhaven.
Miniature Steel Mill Is Now 
Permanent Exhibit In E. H.
For several days there has been 
a decided interest on the part of 
many students in proceedings in 
lower Engineering Hall. This in
terest has been in the steel dio
ramas which have been installed 
there. Although these have not 
been completely finished at the 
time of writing, they are essential
ly read to go. An ingot here or 
there shows anunnatural green
ish color and a chute does not 
quite reach its ladle, but aside 
from that, Carnegies little steel 
mill is quite ready to do its part 
for national defense.
The models are true-to-scale 
perspective reproductions of ac
tual steel-making equipment. 
They do not represent any par
ticular plant,  but portray the 
workings of a typical mill.
Behind the intense activity of 
boom production in the dioramas 
is the more quiet but none the 
less important machinery which 
animates the exhibit. The central 
display requires the most stringpulling, since it represents a fair
ly involved process. A large box, 
containing timers, relays, and wir
ing, so complicated that it reminds 
one of the workings of a pin-ball 
machine, serves to control the 
pourings of steel and its transfer
ence to the proper mold. A fif
teen-second push will activate the 
timer which then turns a dozen 
or more cam-like circuit breakers. 
This masterpiece of electric wir
ing was especially constructed for 
the United States Steel Corpora
tion by an electrical engineer.
Steel is seen to pour from the 
mouth of a ladle. Because of dark 
areas in a mass of molten metal, 
a, stream of it flowing over the 
edge of the ladle, for example, 
would give an alternate light and 
dark effect. In the model this is 
realistically accomplished by a 
small metal damper which re
volves in the path of a bright 
orange-colored light. This alter
nate light and dim illumination, 
falling on a piece of Lucite ex
tending from the mouth of the 
ladle, gives the impression of 
flowing steel.
The exhibit had to be altered 
to fit the space in Engineering 
Hall. The hollows where previous
ly lockers stood now resemble a 
drunken carpenters nightmare,
being filled with saw horses, dado 
joints, cross beam, two by fours, 
etc., etc., in the midst of which, 
of course, is the machinery.
Two five-gallon tanks are heat
ed electrically to supply the 
steam. The latter gives the im
pression of smoke coming from 
the molten metal. These tanks can 
operate for a month at a time 
on one filling.
It is reported by the engineer 
in charge that many undergradu
ates have asked-him what is done 
with the miniature ingots after 
they have been cast.
To transfer the bulky display 
to Carnegie required seven trips 
by three trucks. A door which 
hadnt been opened -for twentyfive years was torn from its rusty 
hinges to allow the parts to be 
brought into Engineering Hall. 
Two carpenters, an artist, and a 
mechanic built and finished the 
structure with the help of several 
laborers.
Several matters in relation to 
the display are as yet unsettled. 
Among these is the question of 
whether Lucite can be used to 
cover the dioramos or whether 
railing ought to be placed in front 
of them. If the display should 
lose interest to the average stu
dent after a year, it may be 
transferred to the metallurgy de
partment, but this is also indefin
ite.
For Exhibition Night, April 25, 
it is expected that the United 
States Steel Corporation will send 
the three men who explained each 
exhibit at the Worlds Fair to do 
the same at Carnegie for the visi
tors.

Student Concert
Music. Department Presents 
Easter Program on April 3
When the Department of Music 
gives its annual Easter concert 
on Thursday, April 3, two move
ments of Gustav Mahlers Sec
ond Symphony will be heard for 
the first time in Pittsburgh. It will 
be the first time that a college 
group in America has attempted 
this difficult work.
The concert will be given at 
the Carnegie Music Hall at 8:15 
P. M. Tickets of admission may 
be obtained at the Music Depart
ment ofllce, Room 153, Arts, next 
Monday, March 31.
Each ' movement of Mahlers 
Second Symphony in C Minor ex
presses another feature of life, 
death, and resurrection. Dr. Fred
erick Dorian, assistant professor 
of music and director of the an
nual Easier concerts, has chosen 
to perform the last, two move
mentsthe fourth and fifth move
ments of the symphony. Written 
in memory of the conductor, Hans 
von Bulow, the symphony, ac
cording to Mahlers own explana
tion, raises the following ques
tions, Why have you lived? To 
what end have you suffered? Is 
it just a groat, terrible jest? We 
must somehow answer this to 
prove life worthwhile, and death 
lifes most magnificent step to
ward, fulfillment. The last move
ment, the musical exposition of
Resurrection inspired by the bur
ial services of Von Bulow, is the 
final answer to these questions.
Musically, the fourth movement 
makes a transition from orches
tra to voice. In this movement 
there is an alto solo, Primeval 
Light, which is sung by Ruth 
Fulton, a graduate of the Depart
ment of Music. The chorus and 
orchestra are both heard in the 
Song of Resurrection, the last 
movement. There are two solo 
parts in this movement, one for 
soprano, which will be sung by 
Betty Morris 44, and the other, 
an alto solo which Miss Fulton 
will sing.
In commemoration of the death 
of Johannes Brahma who died on 
April 3, 1897, one of his compo
sition/: performed on lust year 
program will be repeated. It la 
Song of Destiny.
The concert will be opened with 
a Randall Thompson composition, 
Alleluia. It was1 written at tlio 
request of Dr. Serge Koussevlt'/ky 
for the opening exercises of thti 
Berkshire Music Center. It was 
first performed there on July 8, 
1940. The chorus will, sing Alle
luia, unaccompanieda cappclla.
made soundproof for the Tech 
Symphony broadcasts, and could 
be used by our own station. Oper
ating costs would be offset by paid 
advertisements.
As it appears, the authorities 
are all for it. It is left to us stu
dents to bring the idea to realiza
tion. There are two major diffi
culties. One is on the financial 
side. There are no estimates as 
yet in regards to cost of equip
ment, but, talcing into considera
tion Dr. Works offer, it will cost 
several hundred dollars. It has 
been proposed to make the initial 
power 100 watts which might be 
increased in course of time. One 
hundred would allow for local 
reception.
The second and major diffi
culty is a broadcasting license. 
Commercial radio stations are li
censed by the Federal Communi
cations Bureau. It certainly is a 
tough job to get one, since there 
are already five commercial sta
tions in Pittsburgh, and the air is 
pretty crowded in Allegheny 
County. If, however, the students 
as a body of many thousands of 
individuals apply for it, there is 
reason to believe that a license 
will be granted. This, as well as 
the subsequent stepsbuilding 
and operationrequires the co
operation of the students.
Ideas, suggestions, and criti
cisms are more than welcome. 
Anyone interested in helping with 
the technical work is asked to ad
dress all communications and of
fers to WCIT, c/o Carnegie TAR
TAN, Carnegie Tech, Pittsburgh. 
Come on, boys and girls, and help 
us build up WCIT.

Several years ago a handful of 
Tech students proposed building 
a commercial radio station on the 
campus. It had the approval of 
the authorities, but failed, owing 
to lacic of enthusiasm on the part 
of the organizers themselves.
The idea has been put forward 
again this year, with a good 
chance that it will be carried 
through. It seems to have quite 
an amount of support from stu
dents and authorities; particularly 
from Dr. Keeble, Director of Fine 
Arts, since the drama and music 
students could have an excellent 
opportunity to show their abili
ties to the public and gain micro
phone experience. Dean Wardens 
idea is to broadcast extension 
courses, as they do at Iowa State.

Paper Money
Germany Currency 
Is On Exhibition
In the alcovo opposite Indus
tries 145, the Department of 
Printing has on display a collec
tion of examples of what has kept 
the printers of Germany busy 
through the post war depression. 
It is an exhibition of paper 
money.
From 15)22 to 1924, the period 
covered by the examples on the 
exhibit, practically every com
munity in Germany had its own 
variety or varieties of paper 
money. The total amount in cir
culation in December, 1923, was 
2,273,GOO,000,000,000,000,000 paper 
marks. This was 375,000,000,000 
times the amount in circulation 
when Germany entered the first 
world war.
To give a practical idea of what 
this increase meant, it is to be 
understood that, measured in 1923 
values, $1,261,600,000,000 in marks 
was equivalent to $1.00 in. pre
war marks.
The notes are practically all 
about the size of our money, al
though there are as many sizes 
as there are communities and is
sues represented. Scenes, land
scapes, plants, mythological fig
ures, religious and scientific sub
jectsthese are a few of the 
many themes around which the 
design of the notes are built. 
Even cartoons are the center of 
interest in some of the bills.
Some of the designs are really 
artistic pieces, for all their worth
lessness as money. Most of them 
have several colors in the designs. 
Dominations are mostly 25 pfen
nig and 50 or 75 marks.
Also on display is a fifty billion 
mark stamp, issued in 1923. The 
par value of this stamp would be 
$12,000,000,000; enough to pay all 
the allied war debts and still have 
a little left for exterminating Hit
ler. The amount is more than the 
total metallic gold in existence in 
the world today.

murmured, until I met a man 
without feet. This sentence, met 
my eye as I came across the cut 
and for a moment I was struck 
with the horror behind the state
ment. A man without feet! and 
this man just an ordinary human 
being, had been, before the start 
of the Second World War, a stu
dent just as you and I, studying 
for his degree.
I stopped and read further, 
about the three million prisoners, 
of which 30,000 were students; of 
their deprivations; their intense 
suffering. All I was asked to do 
was to contribute one dollar which 
would help a student acquire the 
bare necessities of life; surely this 
was not much to ask!
Yet barely $200 was collected 
from the entire student body at 
Tech. This W. S. S. F. was to be 
taken as a joke; the money was 
not really going to deserving stu
dentsit was going to go into the 
pockets of the collectors. Many 
excuses were put forth, each one 
being weaker than the last, and 
the W. S. S. F. was viciously con
demned; all this so that a student 
might not be called upon to part 
with some money that he would 
fritter away on pinball machines 
anyway. Oh, yes, we Techites are 
good at avoiding responsibility.
Actually the W. S. S. F. is one 
of the best welfare agencies that 
has been organized since the start 
of the war. It has already sup
plied food, clothing, and the bare 
essentials for continuing an edu
cation to countless unfortunates. 
It has benefitted the Swiss, the 
French, and the Czechs, all with
out appealing to us for help. Due 
to lack of funds, W. S. S. F. is un
able to continue its work in China 
and France. However we, of the 
jntelligtsia, we of comparatively 
comfortable means, we who are so 
well situated and are ourselves re
ceiving an education, refuse to aid 
them in the slightest!
Some of these hard-hearted stu
dents who have amused themselves 
by scribbling inane replies to the 
real expressions of anguish on the 
W. S. S. F. posters, would find it

partment of Printing.
Established in 1913, the depart
ment celebrated its first twentyfive years of existence and serv
ice to the Graphic Arts in Febru
ary, 1938. In recent years there 
has been a reunion each year, and 
after the anniversary reunion, 
there was organized a series of 
technical conferences on problems 
relating to printing.
Inspection 
Again this year, students, staff 
members, alumni, and members of 
the Advisory Council on Graphic 
Arts Education will meet together 
for the purpose of discussing 
topics of mutual interest.
The reunion will begin with an 
inspection of laboratories on Fri
day morning. The rest of the 
morning and most of the afterSenior Interviews

table discussions. In the evening, 
an informal banquet will be held 
at the Pittsburgh Athletic Associa
tion. The program for the ban
quet is incomplete, but will in
clude as speakers Alfred Dickman, 22, who will discuss Trends 
in Modern Typography and Laurance P. Siegfried, printer of Sy
racuse University. Fred J. Hart
man, acting head of the depart
ment from 1924 to 1926, will be 
honorary toastmaster.
It is planned to have several 
exhibits in conjunction with the 
reunion, including a showing of 
the Fifty Books of the Year, a 
feature of previous reunions. 
These books are selected each 
year as representing, in the eyes 
of a jury, the fifty outstanding 
books published during the pre
ceding year. Points evaluated are 
beauty, legibility, and execution 
of craftsmanship.
Committees
Student committees are in 
charge of the affair. They include 
Robert Price, J. Sanford Ken
nedy, Jerome N. Schiff, Dee J. 
Andella and Paul W. Kister on the 
Arrangements Committee; ' Wal
ter Pretzat, Robert Barovets, Ran

man, and Kenneth Macdonald. 
Tickets are being handled by Har
old Anderson, Bradley Wood, 
Charles Richardson, Leonard Chotiner, and Randall H. Pakula; 
while the necessary publications 
are the responsibility of Harold 
Keefe, Donald Opel, John Ander
son, Harold Dunn, and George 
Matonis.
Candidates Seek 
John Stewardson 
Memorial Award
Three Carnegie Tech architects, 
two of them graduates, have qual
ified for the finals in the John 
Stewardson Memorial Scholarship 
Award of 1941. Among the five 
final contestants, chosen as the re
sult of a three-day sketch, A Cre
matory and Columbarium, are 
Herbert W. Joke, B. Arch., 36, 
M. Arch., 40, now teaching inte
rior decoration at Tech for the 
Saturday morning class of high 
school students, Frederick T. Loeffer, B. Arch. 40, designer for the 
Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company, 
and Hugh M. Neilson, B. Arch. 41. 
The two other candidates are from 
the University of Pennsylvania.
The Stewardson Scholarship in 
architecture is won by a compe
tition held in two stages, a pre
liminary test and a final test. The 
five candidates have been chosen 
by the preliminary to compete in 
the final. The subject for the final 
test is to be announced later.
John Stewardson, architect in 
memory of whom this scholarship 
was founded, was born in 1858, 
and in his brief life displayed un
usual gifts; his death in a skating 
accident in his thirty-eighth year 
closed a career of achievement 
notable for so short a life. Not 
only possessing high moral prin
ciples, but also a vigorous and vi
rile character, it is little wonder 
that he had such a great number 
of friends and admirers at his 
death that his honored memory 
invoked a fitting tribute in this 
foundation for the higher training 
of talented young architects, a 
cause for which he himself had 
labored throughout his life.
DwN.R DR3 GNN.oCE
Tomorrow evening at 8:00 
Theta Tau, national engineering 
honorary, will hold a meeting in 
the Union. All members and eli

Sigma Xi Meets

teenth General Science Collo
quium this Thursday at 11:30 A. 
M. in the Faculty Lounge adjoin
ing the Faculty Dining Room. 
James J. Slade, Jr., associate pro
fessor of Rutgers University, is 
the speaker and will talk on 
Some Observations on the Prin
ciple of Least Squares.
This is one of the four collo
quiums held during the academic 
year by the society. Techs chap
terone of the eighty throughout 
the countrywas formally install
ed in 1937. Sigma XI which is 
one of the most outstanding of 
the academic honoraries has as its 
object the encouragement of or
iginal investigation in pure and 
applied science.
No stag line at a tea dance! 
At last my chance had comeno 
longer would I be required to 
hold up a portion of the wall 
(Thistle Hall is rather weak, you 
know). I would be allowed to 
dance with the girl of my dreams. 
Thus it was that I found myself 
last Thursday again painfully 
wending my way up . the stairs to 
Thistle Hall, and again holding 
up the wall, but not for long!
A Paul Jones method of meet
ing everybody was put into action, 
and I met three Mimis, five Jeans, 
and two Sallys in five minutes. 
Why, thats more girls than I met 
in the past three years at Tech. 
After my voice gave out from 
shouting my name at the top of 
my lungs, I got out my namecard and held it up. Some of the 
dames understood that it was me; 
the rest stared blankly at the 
wall behind me.
At a given signal, we lowered 
our heads and charged down the 
floor removing all obstructions in 
the way with a sweep of our arms.
After three more pieces I was 
again wiping the dust off my giv
en post. (Monotonous, isnt it?) 
Continued chargings and dances 
completed the dance, and I must 
say it was one of the best tea 
dances I have ever attended.

Campus Topic
For the past few weeks the campus has been buzzing with 
the slightly raspy voices of various groups of discontented stu
dents all arguing about the Carnegie Citcom Clan and its ulti
mate effect on the Skibo Intramural program.
There seem to be two distinct schools of thought on this 
timely question: first, that the Clan does nothing more than in
crease the competitive spirit of intramural sports by putting 
better teams on the fields and courts; and the other group bluntly 
states that the Commuters organization will eventually cause a 
complete collapse of the intramural program of sports, because 
of the fact that the Clan teams are consistently better than the 
other groups entered in the competition. If the first idea is tlie 
correct one, the young clan should by all means be encouraged 
to continue in its program, for competition is the spice of any 
sporting event. However, if the second group has the proper 
slant on the situation, the happy Clansmen should be immedi
ately throttled, for from the looks of things tlie intramural 
events will soon be tlie major sports features of the campus.
The general school opinion seems to be that the Citcom Clan 
is composed of every commuter who is not associated with a 
fraternity. This belief is not entirely true. Every non-affiliated commuter is a potential member of the clan in as much as he 
has the right to join if he so desires, and can pay the established 
initiation fee. However, my Citcom. informers tell me that only 
the active members of the Clan play under the yellow and black 
banner of the Citcom, and in as mucli as the Clan can boast of 
only eightj^-six male members, in reality their potential athletic 
participants are limited.
Despite the sincerit.y of the Clan fathers who state that their 
club has no more field to choose from than any other entered 
organization, they fail to realize that any independent commuter 
who possesses any athletic ability at all would probably prefer 
to play with the Clan than with any class team, and as the fee 
to join the Citcomers is not too high their ranks are periodically 
swelled by men possessing athletic ability?
The solution to this problem is in the offing, but where no one 
seems to know. When and how it will finally be settled is entire
ly in the hands of Mr. Eyman and his intramural board. How
ever, one thing is certain and that is that action of some sort 
must be taken soon if peace is to be maintained on the intramural 
front.
Swimming Captain Honored
Mr. Risedorph announced last week that this season, for the 
fourth time in the history of the school, a member of his swim
ming squad would be awarded a major C sweater. This distinct 
honor is only conferred 100 those members of the squad who have 
proved to be outstanding leaders and of unmeasurable value to 
the Tartan swimmers. This seasons splasher who will soon sport 
his conferred honor is none other than the squads captain, Bill 
Molvie. Throughout the entire season General William on/many 
occasions has spelled the difference between a win or a loss, 
and 100 all occasions has proved himself to be a capable leader 
of the swimming charges. y
The men who received this award in the past are: Paul 
Caldwell 38 a diver, Randy Boyer 34 a free style and back
stroke man, and Pal Miller 32 a swimmer who majored in 
free-style events.

For Commuters 
Willi 14 Points
By Joe Thomas
Winding up the current Intramural basketball program, the 
SAEs and the Citcom Clan met 
in the Tech gym last Thursday 
night to decide the school cham
pionship. The Commuters emerg
ed Jrom the contest on the long 
end of a 36-14 score, and were 
awarded the rotating champion
ship trophy. This trophy is 
awarded to the winner each year 
and remains in their possession 
until the winner of the next sea
son has been decided. Any or
ganization that wins the school 
championship three times is en
titled to keep the cup permanent
ly. At the present time, there is 
only one group that has two legs 
on the cup, that being Kappa 
Sigma fraternity.
After a hard fight in the fra
ternity league, the SAEs emerg
ed the winners , with eleven wins 
and no losses.. The DUs were sec
ond with only one lossto the 
SAEs, and the Kappa Sigs were 
third with two lossesto the DUs 
and SAEs. In the independent 
league, the Citcom Clan was in 
first place with eleven wins, the 
Metallurgists were second and 
Scobell Hall third.
LETTER TO THE EDITOR
Dear Mr. Floyd:
There appears little criticism in 
regard to the action of the Intra
mural Board in insisting that 
periods of training preceed vigor
ous athletic competition. However, 
in answer to what little criticism 
has come may the following be 
stated:
The average student thinks lit
tle of regularity of habits. The hu
man machine belongs to him and 
is often subjected to greater strain 
than he would put to his automo
bile, and the latter receives great
er supervision and care than does 
the former.
Is it not proper to carefully and 
wisely use the body machine? 
Who, with thought, would ask his 
body machine to respond to severe 
load without previously making
every attempt to strengthen, thru 
systematic training, those factors 
which are to carry the load? '
May this be said, parenthetical
ly, from the standpoint of compe
tition in the Intramural program. 
Why should any student wishing 
to represent his organization in 
scheduled activity fail to realize 
that perfection in performance 
comes through training and he is 
only playing fair by his organiza
tion when making every effort 
count toward perfection.
And, in closing, let there be 
one fatality (one student who 
has developed a detrimental heart 
condition) and there would be, 
and .justly so, severe criticism di
rected toward the Intramural 
Board for having fostered a pro
gram permitting of such.

The game started oil' at a very 
slow rate, neither team being able 
to hit the basket. White ana 
Needham each dropped field goals 
and McClure a free throw for the 
Clan hoopsters. The lone score 
for the SAEs in this period was 
a field goal by Mahaffey.
In the second period the scor
ing increased considerably, the 
Citcom boys scoring thirteen 
points to a lone marker for the 
SAEs. MahafTey again scored for 
the losers, making a free throw. 
Needham was high man for the 
opposition in this period, scoring 
three field goals, Loveday, Mc
Clure, and White each scoring a 
field goal, and McDonald making 
a foul shot, this scoring spree 
making the score at the midway 
point 18-3 in favor of the Clan.
A small contingent of support

Tech's track team is beginning 
to shape up with one meeting to 
their credit so far this spring, 
last Wednesday. The weather has 
not been the best for practice 
since the track has been very 
muddy and the -boys have not 
been able to get onto it.
At the meeting on Wednesday, 
there was a nice turnout of about 
fifty boys. Coach Guy Halferty 
was of the opinion that the run
ning team would be very good. 
Paul Haupt was chosen captain of 
the track team for the coming 
season. Paul has been a good middle-distance man in the past and 
will probably do a great deal to 
help the team on to victory. Ben 
Marcin was picked as the 1941 
cross-country captain since he 
was one of the more outstanding 
runners on the last falls squad.
Although Coach Halferty seem
ed very pleased with the outlook 
of the running team, he was a lit
tle skeptical of the prospects of 
the other events. The absence of 
big boys slims the chances for 
winning in events such as the 
shot-put and the javelin throwing. 
However, George Cax-lutzky did 
well as a freshman, and Mr. Iialierty has hopes that he will do 
as well in varsity competition. He 
is small, weighing only 175 
pounds, but he may do bet
ter than his size would indicate. 
Church will probably take care of 
the javelin throwing for the team, 
but Muha is on probation at the 
present time and therefore will 
probably not be out at all .this 
season. Even with this rather 
small supply of huskies Mr. Hal
ferty hopes to be able to put a 
fairly good team on the field. 
Their first meet this season is 
with Western Reserve on April 
26.
By that time Carnegies team 
should be in fine shape to win.

Football prospects have hit an 
all time low at Carnegie Tech, ac
cording to Dr. Eddie Baker. Only 
a handl'ull of iellows have report
ed for Spring practice, evidencing 
the general lack of interest among 
the students.
The situation is undoubtedly 
caused by the feeling that the 
Tech team is doomed to go on the 
rocks anyhow because of the non
subsidizing policy of the admin
istration. However, this is not 
necessarily true. The grid schedule 
of the Skibos has been lightened 
lor next season with Pitt and 
Notre Dame the only real pigskin 
powers on the slate. With a little 
spirit and co-operation the re
maining games can be victories 
for the Plaid.
There will probably be a great 
many more recruits turning out 
next fall but it must be empha
sized that Spring practice is an 
integral part of the football pro
gram and those fellows who take 
advantage of it will have the 
jump on the others in the autumn.
Unless more candidates do show 
up for the spring training Coach 
Baker will probably call the 
whole thing off,; which would just 
about kill any chance that Tech 
might have of getting back into 
the pigskin limelight.

The basketball game last Thurs
day night between the Citcom 
Clan and the SAEs was a thrill
ing climax to a spectacular Intra
mural season. As it is now past 
history, the Citcommers were vic
torious and'to them goes the tro
phy. This season has been one of 
the' most closely followed by the 
students and one in which many 
participated. In all, twenty-four 
teams entered competition, and 
all but three finished their sched
ules. Each league, Fraternity and 
Independent, was composed of 
twelve teams, a fitting division 
for a long run of games. It is co
incidental if not significant that 
in oach league the three top teams 
ended up with the same aver
ages for the season. Both the Cit
commers and the SAEs were un
defeated through competition, tlie 
second place Metallurgists and 
DUs lost only one game, and the 
third place teams, Scobell Hall 
and the Kappa Sigs had only two 
losses against them.
Slipping in for a short season 
between the schedules of the ma
jor events is the free throw event. 
Teams are composed of four men, 
and individuals compete in a 
separate tournament. Each mem
ber shooting is entitled to three 
practice throws before he begins 
the regular competition of twen
ty-five tries. The team sinking the 
most number of throws becomes 
the winner, Team matches will 
begin Wednesday, March 26, and. 
the individual tournament will bo 
held at 7:30 Thursday, March 27.
Yesterday marked the begin
ning oil the current swimming 
season for the Intramural cup. Al
though many teams have had 
some trouble in getting in the 
required number of practice 
hours, the worst is now passed 
and the splashing is under way,
Potential winners of the Car
negie Point Trophy are beginning 
to draw ahead of the pack and 
settle down to a struggle to the 
finish. With only three events to 
go, the competition is becoming 
keen. Leading the pace with a to
tal of 515 points is Delta Tau 
Della. Following in order are: 
D. U.s (431), PIKAs (345) and 
Tau Delts (340).
For the last event of the year, 
softball practice will start soon 
and all entries are due at 5:00 
P. M., on Monday.

Final Matches;
3 Teams Tied
Clan Almost Sure 
To Win League II 
lty Wide Margin
As the bowlers swing into the 
final weeks of league bowling 
three teams still hold a corner of 
the League A trophy. These 
teams, PiKAs, Betas and Delts, 
each took three points from their 
opponents, SAEs, DU's and Kap
pa Sigs, to bring their totals to 
18 wins and 3 losses. This tie will 
be broken next week, when the 
PiKAs meet the Betas. Provid
ing that the Delts remain on top, 
there will be only 2 teams to 
hold this titlethe Delts and the 
winner of the afore mentioned 
match.
The Beta Sigs added 2 prints to 
their score by defeating the Sigma 
Nus. This event placed the Beta 
Sigs in the second berth, along 
side of the DUs. Both of these 
teams have Won 9 and lost 12.
The Phi Kaps won 2 from the 
ATOs, while the Tau Delts took 
3 from Boss Hall. The Senior 
Mechanicals rolled 3 points away 
from the Architects. Even though 
the results of the Theta Xi-Citcom 
Clan match are not in at this 
printing, it is fairly safe to assume 
that the Clan still holds the top 
notch by the usual wide margin.

Earle and his orchestra. Jimmy is 
well known on the Evening 
School campus. He has been play
ing at our dances for the past few 
years and has been well received 
by the dancers. He has recently 
acquired the sweet voice of Rita 
Rhea as his vocalist. Rita was re
cently featured by Gray Gordon 
and his orchestra and has been on 
several radio programs eminating from Hollywood.
The spring dance will be held 
in the gymnasium which will be 
richly decorated with gayly col
ored lights and balloons. Our 
much used crystal ball will cast 
its spotted reflections down up
on the dancers.
As usual, lovely corsages will 
be presented to the first 200 girls. 
The music will start at 9:00 
oclock and as necessary must 
conclude at midnight.
This will be the last opportun
ity for those insignia workers, who 
are registered in the College of 
Industries to earn their college 
points. Four college points from 
your own college must be earned 
before you are eligible for your 
Insignia. Points may be earned 
'Saturday afternoon at 2:00 
oclock, Saturday night about 
0:30, and Sunday afternoon at 
2:00 oclock.
The officers of Industries in
clude Ed Tiepel, president; Stan
ley Storlarcyk, vice president; 
Frank A. Carlos, treasurer; Miss 
Eleanor Gorslcey, secretary; and 
Miss Virginia Anderson, social 
chairman.
This is Industries last affair of 
the year. All Industries students 
will be admitted free by present
ing their registration cards at the 
door. Otherwise, admission can be 
gained for the sum of one dollar.

Despite the fact that well 
probably be accused of dedicat
ing this column to one James 
(Bluebeard) Miller, we must
mention his name just once more. 
It seems James wondered out of 
the Plcfid office and down the hall 
to the Tartan office. A short time 
later, screams were heard and Jim 
came back with his tie wrapped 
around his neck. It must have 
been in fun though because Jim 
escorted one of them on an errand 
a short time later.
One of the old timers on the 
Plaid staff has been absent for 
the last two weeks. Arnold Anex 
our ace "Mast Head Typer is 
sick in bed with a strep throat. 
The staff extends best wishes for 
a speedy recovery.
Did you boys and gals see the 
beautiful Nick in Ed Tiepels 
nose? He claims he ran into the 
wall while swimrtiing under water 
at the Tech pool. We wonder?
Russ Neumen isnt much of a 
bowler except on Friday nights. 
Could it be because of the prox
imity of a certain ice skating 
blonde who bowls as well as she 
skates and looks plenty nice.
Were wondering when Dan 
/ Visnic is going to break down 
and bring some of his girl friends 
to our dances. We hear that they 
are pretty nice, so give us a break, 
Dan.
Honest, fellas, there were ac
tually four girls at the swimming 
pooL last Wednesday. Highlight of 
the evening was a couple of (bar
itones?) in the shower room.
Wonder whats going to happen 
to a couple of fellas whose fancy 
this spring will turn to golf 
and . . .
Tis rumored that Andrew Pas
tor is in the market for a girl 
friend. As to color, he makes no 
specific reuirements, but she must 
be either blonde, redhead, or 
brunette. Come on you gals at 
Maggie Murph . . .
Help! Help!
Industries Needs 
Workers for Dance
To all workers interested in 
earning points toward an insignia, 
the Spring Dance of the Voca
tional courses to be held Saturday 
evening, April 5th, presents a 
golden opportunity in that this 
will be the last opportunity for 
Vocational students to secure the 
four points from their college 
necessary for an insignia.
In accordance with the usual 
custom, three periods are avail
able in which to earn points. The 
Saturday afternoon session held 
from 2:00 P. M. to 5:00 P. M., is 
the most popular and needs work
ers to help decorate the hall. Sat
urday evening students have a 
chance to work in the checkroom 
and. assist at the door. Sunday 
beginning at 2:00 P. M., the clean
up period willl begin.

Extended Vacation 
Given To Students 
In AH Colleges
Holidays are few and far be
tween in the second semester, but 
they do come, and this year the 
Easter vacation is extended one 
day. In contrast to last year, when 
vacation started on Thursday and 
classes began again Monday; this 
year, vacation begins on Thurs
day, April 10, and classes resume 
on Tuesday, April 15. Just think, 
no classes for five days. Now, you 
can go out and bowl that extra 
line, or visit those people you 
havent seen for some time. The 
only drawback, perhaps, is that 
there will be no Plaid issued. But 
we can pick that up, with our 
classes, the following week. So 
remember, vacation begins Thurs
day, April 10, and. classes resume 
the following Tuesday.

F. Fargotstein 
Leads Officers 
Of Arts School
Ambitious Student 
Exercises Active 
Social Program
Last fall at its regularly sched
uled election party, the Evening 
College of Fine Arts elected Fred 
M. Fargotstein as president of 
that group and to represent them 
on the Evening Student Council. 
Although this is his first year as 
a council member he was quite an 
active worker on the campus last 
year as a member of the College 
)f Fine Arts Social Committee.
Fred was bom and raised in the 
Pittsburgh area. He attended Pea
body High School, where he fol
lowed the college preparatory 
course of studies. Although he 
doesnt mention the fact, w,e have 
found that he was quite an active 
high school, student. He was a 
member of the school band and 
was quite proud of his red and 
white uniform. He was graduated 
from Peabody with honors in the 
summer of 1938.
Coming to Tech in 1938, Fred 
registered in the Degree Course of 
Architecture of the College of 
Fine Arts. The course is scheduled 
as thirteen years and he expects 
to receive his degree sometime 
around 1951. During his daylight 
hours he is employed by Fisher, 
Simboli, and Marks, Registered 
Architects, as a draftsman. The 
few hours he has left during the, 
summer months are spent playing 
baseball, soft-ball, and pitching 
horse-shoes.
Fred usually attends the schools

dances alone and he states that 
he doesnt care about the mem
bers of the fair sex but he can 
always be found hanging around 
the feminine artists in the paint
ing and design drawing rooms.
Receiving his first Evening Stu
dent Council Activities Award 
last year, Fred was called to the 
Nu Sigma "Alpha Activities Hon
orary Fraternity for his work on 
the Evening School Campus.

FooiiHy-Clin.p crons
At each of our dances some 
members of faculty are always in 
attendance as chaperons. Willing
ly they always accept the invita
tions to serve, and just as cap
ably they always handle their 
duties. Not stand-offish or severe, 
they make themselves and the 
students feel completely at home.
We are indeed fortunate to have 
such a fine group of people help
ing to make our dances a success.
Jittcr-Bug;
Undoubtedly the most harden
ed group of criminals in the world 
are the jitter-bugs who attend 
our dances. They have no respect 
for the feelings or desires of the 
others. They crowd the smooth 
dancers out of the center of the 
floornot by asking but by forc
ing. To attempt to dance would 
be fool hardy, the danger of bruis
es and bumps from flying heels 
is too great. If people must jitter
bug all we ask is that they re
tire to a corner instead of trying 
to steal the show. Remember that 
old rule, Do unto others as you 
would have them do unto you 
well, lets practice it.
Hilltop House
Carnegie Techs Hilltop House 
is located at the corner of Forbes 
and Beeler Streets, and is presid
ed over by Mrs. Patterson. Its 
spacious rooms offer a friendly 
retreat for any of the students 
who may want to rest. Recreation 
rooms, conference rooms, and 
business offices are all located 
under its roof. Mrs. Patterson, the 
charming hostess, always makes 
the students feel at home. More 
students should make use of the 
facilities however. The adminis
tration has gone to great expense 
to provide them for us and we 
can best show our appreciation by 
using them.
Y'ometimes a dozen miles
