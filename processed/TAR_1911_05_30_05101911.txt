TRACK MEET GREAT SUCCESS
Applied Science Wins Hamerschlag Trophy 
Pittsburgh High takes Interscholastic Meet
The first annual Interscholastic Track Meet held 
under the auspices of the Carnegie Technical Schools 
in conjunction with the annual High School meet of 
of the institution which was held Saturday, May 6, 
set a high standard to which to live up to. Eleven 
preparatory schools were represented by over one 
hundred athletes, while over fifty men were entered 
for the inter-school contests.
The weather was ideal both for the athletes and 
the spectators and as the track was in excellent con
dition fast time was made. McCutcheon, P. H. S., 
broke the 12-pound shot record, while Waite, D, 
broke the school record for the two-mile run.
In the inter-school meet intense rivalry was shown 
by the representatives of the Science, Design and 
industries and every event was bitterly contested. 
The men from each school worked together in their 
races and throughout the meet there was that spir
it of fairness and cleanness which made for good 
feeling among all concerned. By winning the meet 
the School of Applied Science retains the Hamerschlag Trophy which it won last year. This year, 
however, they were given a much closer race by the 
Design and Industries schools. Out of the total 
number of entrants, twenty men took places, and 
from this number Carnegie Tech will pick her track 
team.
Captain Wait, D, ran well in both events in which 
he was entered, winning the two-mile and losing to
McCrory by inches in the one-mile. Steinmetz, D, 
proved himself a wonder in the dashes, winning three 
firsts in the three events he entered. His time of 
10 1-5 in the hundred will make all local stars take 
notice. Boots, S, was individual point winner, and 
judging from his records we do not have much to 
fear in the weight and jump events. Boots took five 
places, two firsts, two seconds and one third. Craw
ford, last years proud winner was still weak as a 
rsult of a recent illness, yet in spite of that drew 
three seconds and a tie for first. There were a num
ber of new faces among the point winners who give 
great promise for the future .among them being 
Miller, S, Beeken, S, and French, S, in the distances. 
Lise, I, and Roesner, S, in weights and Kirk, S, and 
Sperry, S, in the dashes. Suthern, I, was the main
stay of the Industries team, winning a total of four
teen points. Suthern showed great versatility in 
participating in the hurdles, hammer throw, pole 
vault and broad jump, winning two firsts, a second 
and third.
The Design men were too much for the Science 
in the relay, although the argument was not settled 
until the last lap. Owing to lack of material, the 
Industries school was not represented in this event.
At the conclusion of the events, the athletes and 
officials repaired to the Field House, where Director 
Hamerschlag, after a short speech of welcome and 
hospitality to the visiting men distributed the

awards. After the distribution of prizes, a light 
lunch was served to all present. At this time the 
Glee Club gave several selections and thus closed a 
most successful track meet.
Manager McCorkle deserves great credit for the 
arrangements made and the officials are to be con
gratulated for the apparent ease with which the 
events were run off. The officials were:
Referees, Dr. Hamerschlag, Dean Leete.
Clerk of CourseMr. McCulloch.
Assistant Clerks of CourseBlair, Mandeville, 
Pranks.
TimersDr. Savage, Mr. Wood Mr. Butler.
JudgesMr. Edgerton, Mr. Dosey, Mr. Keller, Mr. 
Leeds, Mr. Dennison, Mr. Reed, Mr. Lose Mr. Lightner.
StarterMr. Page, P. A. A.
Scorers, Kline, Duff.
AnnouncerRayburn.
Custodian of PrizesEhrenfelt.
One of the features which kept the five hundred 
and more spectators in a good humor was the work 
of Rayburn in his official capacity as announcer.
rl he men winning first place in the inter-schcol 
meet were given a pair of running shoes, while those 
coming second received a track suit. The prizes 
were very suitable and were something which could 
be W'ell appreciated by the men.
The first, second and third men in the inter-scho
lastic meet were awarded gold, silver and bronze 
medals.
McCutcheons performance in the shot put, when 
he broke the inter-scholastic record by six inches in 
his throw of 45 feet, was a great feat. McCutcheon 
has been doing great work at Pittsburgh High for 
the past; few years, but this year promises to 
eclipse all.

THURSDAY MORNING LECTURE
At the regular Thursday morning lecture hour at 
the Science School, the students were addressed by 
Father McDermott, who is at present connected 
with the Duquesne University, formerly known as 
Pittsburgh College. His subject was Africa, on 
which he is well qualified to speak, having spent 
years of his life in the Dark Continent. He had 
been located in the interior of Northern Africa, 
1750 miles from the western coast, and described 
the life of the blacks, the whites and the mission
aries of that country, telling many humorous anec
dotes of his work in teaching among the blacks. He 
aslo described to some extent the animal and plant 
life and the industries of the people. Cotton grow
ing has become an important industry of that coun
try in recent years, due largely to the efforts of the 
whites. -
Father McDermott said that he had not been sick 
a day during the whole time he spent in Africa and 
attributed his good health largely to his athletic
activities during his youth and young manhood. He 
described the work which his order is carrying on 
in That part of Africa and illustrated his lecture 
throughout with lantern slides, wiiich were both in
teresting and instructive. One in particular was a 
picture taken from the top of a mountain and showed 
a storm going on in the clouds below. Another 
showed five little natives just after a hearty meal, 
and caused considerable laughter.
It is to be regretted that on account of lack of 
time, Father McDermott was obliged to shorten his 
lecture and to pass hurriedly over many of his 
slides.
Prodigyous.Patty, said Grandma, I think it 
about time you stopt playing witn boys. Little girls 
ought not to care to play with boys, when theyre as 
large as you.
Oh, thats all right, Grandma. Why, the bigger 
we get, the better we like em.Lippincotts Maga

6THE TARTAN
SPEECH BY PROF. TRINKS TO C. M. E. S.
The Tartan takes pleasure in reproducing the 
speech of Prof. Trinks to the Carnegie Mechanical 
Engineer Society last Saturday evening. The speech 
has a special bearing upon the spirit of helpfulness 
that should exist between the students of the schools 
and the co-operation that should exist between the 
day and night students. It is as follows:
My dear students and friends:Four years ago 
the Inventors Society was formed by the day stu
dents. It was rather exclusive because the day stu
dents then disliked the idea of mingling with the 
night students. We all know that the Inventors So
ciety died a natural death and I feel quite sure that 
the idea of the day students that they are too good 
to mingle with night students has also died a natu
ral death.
The day students and the night students have 
learned to appreciate each other; a spirit of helpful
ness has taken the place of false pride.
Tonight, at the formal opening of this club room,
I wish to sound the keynote of helpfulness. Get to
gether here and help one another. The night stu
dents are out in the industries; they see what oth
ers, better mentally equipped, can do and are anxious 
to learn those things. They can very quickly convert 
into breakfast food that which they learn here and 
they let usi teachers know what they can convert in
to breakfast food and what is inconvertible. They 
are in a position to inform the day students of the 
condition of the industries. On the other hand the 
day students have more time for the study of theory 
and can help the night student in the solution of his 
problem. The spirit of helpfulness should extend 
further. Seniors will help Juniors and Juniors will
help Sophomores. Mutual help is needed, as long 
as it does not take the form of cribbing. Just where 
the dividing line is, nobody can say definitely. Your 
own conscience is probably the best guide. That mu
tual help is necessary can easily be proven from 
history. Suppose you had asked Newton or Euler 
to design and build a gas engine or an electric motor. 
Both men were among the finest and ablest thinkers 
of the wolrd and yet they did not know a gas en
gine or an electric motor.
This shows how much we depend upon the work 
of others, how much we must study what others 
have done before us until we can accomplish some
thing ourselves. No matter how great you are; if 
you shut yourself up from information of what 
others have done, you will amount to very little. 
Many teachers say, Be original, think for yourself. 
All well and good, but do not forget to look up what
others have done, because the road to success is 
paved with the failures of others.
Get together, find out the failures of others and 
use them as stepping stones towards success. Of 
course this society should not spend all of its time 
in shop talk. Social pleasures, smoking, singing, and 
story telling must add spice, but they should remain 
spice only. When they overshadow ancT~kill the 
spirit of helpfulness and the technical aspect of the 
Society, then the Society will die in spite of the 
material evidences of its existence that now sur
round you here. I certainly hope that this room 
will bring the various classes of this department 
closer together to the best advantage of every mem
ber.

DUEL MEET SATURDAY.
West Virginia Here.
On next Saturday afternoon May 13, followers of 
track and field athletics will be given an opportuni
ty of seing what Carnegie Tech can do in that line 
against another college. The University of West 
Virginia will be our opponents in a duel meet at 
Tech Field. Last year the meet with the Mountain
eers was held at Morgantown and mutual surprises 
made the event an interesting one. West Virginia 
captured the dashes, which had been conceded us, 
while Tech athletes excelled in the distances, where 
their opponetns expected to shine.
That this years team has good hopes of beating 
ing records established at Tech by previous athletics 
was shown on Saturday. In the first meet of the 
season, Steinmertz equalled the record for the 100
yard dash of 10% seconds establised by Dowling, 
OS, while Captain Waite set a new mark for the twowhich is 20 feet, when he succeeded in making 19
This cut down the former record by 17 seconds. 
Boots came lose to the record for the broad ump
which is 20 feet when he succeeded in making 19
feet 7 inches. The weight men are also working 
well and should make West Virginias best strain 
themselves to the limit in the contests.
The men who will compete for Carnegie Tech are 
Capt. Wait, Steinmertz, Gilkinson, Weaver, McCrory 
Sutherin, Lose, Criswell, Vaughn, Crawford, C. M., 
er, Roessner, Murphy, Ballinger and Holliday.
The meet wiu be held on the Field immediately 
following the baseball game with Western Reserve. 
The first event will probably start at 3 oclock and 
the meet will be run through as quickly as possi
ble. This is a chance to show the track team that 
the student body is as willing to support track ath
letics, and also is an opportunity to see some clean, 
exciting contests, as West Virginia has always made 
it interesting for our men.
FORMER INDUSTRIES MAN BECOMES 
EMPLOYER.
Down in the engine room there is a glider, fast 
going to pieces. One of the men who made that glider 
having graduated, has now reached that stage at 
which he becomes an employer. J. A. Slingerland, 
1910, in the department of Electrical Equipment and 
Construction, is the man who is now, in a letter to 
Mr. Calderwood of recent date, is writing for some 
good man to fill a position he has open in his new 
electrical contracting business. He says that, owing 
to the pressure of work, he wants a man who is not 
that tired sort.
Upon leaving school Slingerland engaged in the 
manufacture of model aeroplanes and as a dealer 
in aeronautic supplies, giving this up for the more 
renumerative electrical work.
TEN DOLLARS FOR WORDS OF SONG.
Director Hamerschlag Offers Prizes for New Song
Director Hamerschlag has offered, through the 
Tartan, a prize of ten dollars to be given to the writ
er of the best words, set to martial music, for a new 
Tech song. This competition is open to any student. 
The compositions shall not consist of more than two 
verses, together with a chorus, and shall be handed 
to the Editor of the Tartan on or before June 1st.
A jury consisting of the Director, Mr. McDowell, 
a faculty representative, a student representative, 
and the Editor of the Tartan are to pass upon the 
merits of the respective compositions and make the 
award, which will be announced commencement 
week. It is hoped that a large number of students 
will enter this contest and that a new' song of worth 
may be secured. Any further information desired 
may be secured from the Editor of the Tartan.

MHO AND CRUCIBLE MEETING.
The regular monthly meeting of the Mho Club 
will be held on Friday evening, May 12, in conjunc
tion with the Crucible Club. This promises to be an 
important meeting, as Mr. B. Dyer, a representative 
of the National Carbon Co., of Cleveland, Ohio, will 
speak on the Manufacture and Application of Car
bon. This lecture has been given before the engi
neering students of several of the larger schools 
and is so worked up as to be of special value to the 
electrical and chemical students. A large turn out 
of the members is urged since this is the last regu
lar meeting of the semester and it is desired to close 
up the balance of the years business. A cordial 
invitation is extended to all students interested in 
this lecture to attend Friday evening.

NEW OFFICERS OF MUSICAL CLUBS.
At the annual meeting of the Carnegie Musical 
Clubs the following officers were lected for the sea
son 1911-12:
President ......................................................L. H. Button
Manager ......................................................L. R. Madison
Business Manager............................................H. A. Warne
Stage Manager  ................................................C. E. Moss
Publicity Manager...........................................G. G. Kelcey
Secretary and Treasurer.................................L. A. Orril
Glee Club Librarian..........................................I. H. Kindi
Mandolin Club Librarian .............................J. P. Bailey
The new offcers begin work immediately on the 
program for the coming year and it is expected that 
they will have a good schedule of out-of-town con
certs.
Tne past season has been a very successful one 
and the retiring officers deserve much credit for 
the improvement they have made in the clubs as 
well as for the financial success of the season.
BAR-HEADED LEAGUE.
The Tartan takes pleasure in announcing that a 
movement has been started by some students to 
eschew dome coverings and use the covering of 
hirsute exuberance with which Dame Nature has 
kindly adorned their domes.
Such a movement is very commendable, and, no 
doubt if successful, will deal a body blow to the hat 
trust. It will also tend to lessen the number of 
those gentlemen whose heads are characterized by 
a paucity of foresaid hirsute exuberance, in short, 
of bald gentlemen.
This announcement is based on what the Tartan 
representative learned from T. R. Critchelow who 
was discovered walking to school without the prover
bial adornment on his dome and promptly inter
viewe.d.
The Tartan will endeavor to gather full particulars 
with regard to this important movement for the ben
efit of its readers.

THE TARTAN9
In a recent issue of a widely read magazine there 
appeared an article on scientific management by 
Frederick W. Taylor of Philadelphia. In the article 
Mr. Taylor quoted an example of how by more co
operation between the employer and employee the 
employee or workingman could turn out consider
ably more work per day.
A laborer whose work was to load pig iron on a 
car, day in and day out was accustomed to load so 
many tons per day.
It was discovered that by a certain scientific meth
od of loading prescribed by the employer in which 
the laborer loaded the pig iron and then rested dur
ing uniform spaces of time that the laborer was able 
to load on the car 2 or 3 times the weight of pig iron

day night, May 12, and lists of drawings with the 
time of the games will be posted on the bulletin 
boards as soon thereafter as possible.
ZETA LAMBDA EPSILON OUTING.
The members of the Zeta Lambda Epsilon took ad
vantage of the holiday on Founders Day for a trip 
up the Allegheny river. They left Aspinwall Wed
nesday afternoon and paddled up to Natrona, there
he was formerly accustomed to load, to the glory of 
the employer.
Now outside of Machinery Hall there has been ly
ing a number of tons of pig iron going to waste, 
which could afford an excellent opportunity of test
ing the authenticity of the above discovery, and it is 
to be hoped that the department of shop management 
will get busy and investigate. Mr. Alfred J. Ormston says he will carry the pig iron.
TENNIS WEATHER.
As a result of the warm afternoons, dry courts, 
etc., the tennis season is on in full force. The an
nual Inter-Class tournament will start Monday, May 
15, and continue until the championships are decid
ed. The tournamen will be run on the scratch 
schedule adopted last year, and the winners will re
making camp for the night. The next morning the 
trip was continued to Jacks Island. After enjoying 
a feed of time honored baked beans, bacon and 
eggs, baked potatoes and a chaser of sassafras tea, 
the homeward trip was begun. The excursion was 
very much enjoyed by all, especially by Messrs. 
Anchors and Kukovitch who without the necessary 
preparations deemed it necessary to take a rather 
hasty bath. Aspinwall was reached with barely time 
enough to get ready for the Founders Day Exercises 
at the Music. Hall that evening. The members are 
planning for a more extensive trip in the near fu
ture.
The engineers of the University of Minnesota are 
constructing an elevated railroad three miles long, 
to be used for experimental purposes.

Mr. W. H. Buente, associate editor, will edit the is
sue of the Tartan appearing next week. This plan 
of having the associate editors take charge of an is
sue will be followed for the balance of the year.
One feature of our college life which, naturaly, 
attracts the attention and interest of all is our stu
dent activities. As time has gone on, certain of 
these activities have improved and increased the 
size and importance of their work until they have 
won for themselves a well defined place, one which 
is recognized by faculty and student body alike. 
Others have shown themselves to be unfit and have 
died a natural death. Others are still fighting to es
tablish themselves upon a good firm basis.
The Musical Clubs have this year won the posi
tion for which they have been contending ever since 
they were established five years ago and the credit 
is due in no small measure to the management of 
this past season. Under Manager Button, the Glee 
Club has shown that there exists a field in which 
they can do a good and important work and it is 
to be hoped that the officers of the coming year will 
realize this and carry out what has already been so 
admirably begun. In Mr. McDowell the Clubs have 
the best leader they have ever had, one who has 
been able to inject into the club some of his own 
great enthusiasm. The results of this together with 
the training uiey have undergone was very appar
ent at the home concert. We can well say then, 
that these Clubs have found themselves and their 
place. May the future years show that they have 
within themselves the power to hold and improve 
their position and go ever forward.
As an exact antithesis of the Musical Clubs come 
the White Friars, with the announcement that no 
show will be given this year. Here is an organiza
tion which has not only failed to go forward but has 
fallen woefully behind. The White Friars had promise 
of a great future. Three high class musicals have been 
produced and a good following won A spirit had 
been built up among the members of the club, one 
with which it should have been possible to do much. 
And now, through absolute and uncomprehensible 
mismanagement upon the part of the director and 
officers of the club, the labor of three years has 
gone for naught and if the club is to live at all it 
must do so by beginning next year exactly where it 
began five years ago. There is absolutely no reason
able excuse which can be offered for this failure. 
The club has received from the Student Activity 
Fund and Committee much more aid, financial and 
otherwise, than any other student activity. It had 
a better spirit upon which to work and a greater 
prospect for uie future than any other student ac
tivity. It had back of and behind it more student in
terest than any other student activity, excepting of 
course, athletics. And yet, with all this wealth up
on which to build, the club has been allowed to go 
to pot and rot.
Ever since its organization this club has had a 
stiff fight for existance. The first year it was used 
purely and simply as a political club and nothing 
else. The second year it produced its first play and 
from that time began to grow. It might be further 
said that this same first play was the only one which 
paid for itself. The successes of the club have been 
along an artistic line rather a financial one and the 
Student Activity Fund has been very freely called 
upon. For this season a new play was secured, one 
which was to have been written by three newspaper 
men and which would unquestionably have had a 
wider appeal than any other of the plays produced. 
This, coupled with the probably low cost of pro
duction seemed to bid fair to make the balances on 
the right side of theTedger at the close of the season.

---------------------------------------------------

THE TARTAN11
And now no production is to be made this year and 
what we firmly believed to have been a golden oppor
tunity cast aside. We make no charges against anyone 
but hold that the director and the officers of the 
club are responsible, and not the members of the club 
It is a shame. It should not be. But since it is, the on
ly thing remaining is to start anew next fall, minus 
those who are responsible for this years failure, and 
built the club afresh, from the basement up.
Tech needs and wants just such an activity as the 
White Friars proclaimed to be. She should have one.

To the Editor: 
In the early days of our race the Almighty said to 
the first in our race, In the sweat of thy face shalt 
thou eat bread. and since then, if we accept the light 
and the air of heaven, no good thing has been or can 
be enjoyed by us without having first cost labor. 
Extract from letter by Lincoln.
There are probably very* few young men or young 
women who dignify work, and particularly their 
own work, by this thought. The usual conception 
begins and ends with the definition by Mark Twain 
Work consists of whatever a bodys obliged to 
do, and' play consists of whatever a body is not 
obliged to do. And this is but natural, for in the 
very complex conditions of life today, the average 
man and woman is given a very specialized and 
therefore a very limited task to perform. The work 
becomes mechanical and it is difficult for the work
er to keep before him the relation his small opera
tion bears to the whole product, and still harder to 
see how he is in any way ministering to human needs 
and thus obtain the inspiration that comes from the 
larger tasks. The worker is apt to become a plod
der in a treadmill. Tiiis is one of the unfortunate 
facts of this age of specialization.
Even by a student voluntarily preparing himself 
for a chosen calling the individual tasks of the 
course of study are regarded as burdensome. He 
wishes to become an engineer yet his mathematics 
and his physics are apt to be considered irksome, and 
he sometimes has the attitude of a galley slave toward 
his instructor. He forgets that no good thing has 
been or can be enjoyed by us without having first 
cost labor. But this is neither a new nor an un
natural attitude and while the dignifying of our work 
is greatly to be desired, the writer has no utopian 
idea that there will soon be any marked change. 
Moreover, there is a great deal of value and disci
pline in work as mere work.
But there is one phase of the question of the dig
nity and duty of labor that does need emphasis and 
correction, particularly on the part of the educated 
man. We hear a great deal in these days of the 
unearned increment in property valuesthat in
crease in value which comes not as the result of 
the owner, but is due to conditions to which he con
tributes only in a very indirect way. There is just 
such an unearned increment in other relations in 
life. In the field of morals, in the field of knowledge, 
in the many advantages of the civilization of today, 
we are living upon the fruits of the labors of others. 
The educational opportunities we enjoy are the re
sult of years of study and research by generations 
of men. The mere associations of college life en
rich the mind of the student by an unearned incre
ment of culture and knowledge. This is as it should 
be, but does it not also impose upon us the

12THE TARTAN
* obligation to contribute our part toward the 
general advancement? Have you ever thought 
what would become of a community if all the men 
engaged with an altruistic purpose in philanthropy, 
in civic improvement, in moral crusades, should sud
denly renounce their ideals and devote themselves 
entirely to personal gain?
One of the most insistent and it seems to me most 
; just criticisms of our educational system is that it 
encourages selfishness. ' With the broadening out of 
higher education into more commercial callings than 
the old professions, the product is becoming more 
self-seeking, more lacking in men with a deep sense 
of responsibility toward the community. Special
ization seems to breed men who are content 
to devote this unearned increment to personal ad
vancement without an adequate return in the form of
the burden on to the shoulders of others is the great 
durable curse of the race.
John H. Leete.
YOUR PRESENCE REQUESTED.
After considerable parley between the managers 
of the respective teams, the baseball nine from West
ern Reserve University of Cleveland, will meet the 
varsity on Tech Field on Saturday afternoon. A redhot game is promised. That Tech will have no easy 
task, is realized from the fact that the Cleveland 
team recently beat the University of Michigan.
No game was played last week by the varsity, 
but the team has held daily practice. Special at
tention has been paid to the batting and the men 
show some improvement over their past performunselfish service for the general good. President 
Hadley recently endorsed a statement by an English 
economist that the standard of personal morality in 
America is decidedly higher than in England, that of 
commercial probity a little lower, and that of po
litical morality quite distinctly lower. Such a con
dition can be accounted for largely by the indiffer
ence to obligation if not actual selfishness of our 
educated class.
This very belief and inadequate contribution upon 
so large a subject is intended merely to suggest to 
the mind of the student two thoughts: First, can 
we not grasp a larger ideal of our daily work? and 
Second, can we not make some return for the large 
portion of the unearned increment we are enjoy
ing? I will close, as I began, with a quotation from 
Lincoln, As labor is the common burden of our 
race, so the efforts of some to shift their share of
ances. The coaches are undecided as to who will 
pitch for the home team, but it is likely that Urquhart will start the game. He has shown class in 
the previous games pitched. Moorehead and Brown 
are also in good condition and are ready to go in and 
win at any time.
As the guarantee is a large one for Saturdays 
game, each student owes it to the schools to attend 
and bring a friend. The admission is a bargain, as 
it entitles the spectator to view the game and the 
track meet following. Athletic tickets will be hon
ored for students, but dont forget that friend. The 
game will start at 1 oclock.

am worth.

Last Saturday evening, the Carnegie Mechanical 
Engineering Society celebrated the acquisition of a 
club room by devoting the evening to a social time. 
Tht affair also took the form of a reception to the 
plebes who have elected the Mechanical Engineering 
course. President W. L. Munk of the Society was 
the master of ceremonies and held the job down 
very well. Mr. Munk in his opening speech made 
the statement that within a week or two the society 
would be in the possession of a piano, the money for 
which had been promised by some neighboring
companies. The speakers of the evening were 
Professor Trinks, Assistant Professor Sproull, for
mer president Walton, former president Smith and 
Secretary Holiday. Professor Trinks spoke on the 
past and present history of the society and gave 
some valuable advice with regard to the future. 
His speech is published elsewhere. Mr. Sproull gave 
a talk on a pump that is very much in use at pres
ent. Messrs. Smith and Walton each devoted the 
most of his speech to a eulogy of the society admin
istration. Secretary Holiday spoke on matters per
taining in general to the society. Several vocal 
selections were rendered by a quartette composed of 
Messrs Kukovitch, Gaylord, Paisley and McParlin.
Refreshments and smokes were handed around.
The club room is now in possession of chairs, ta
bles, bookcases, periodicals and a large banner with 
the initials of the society on it. The last meeting of 
the society for the school year will, in all likelihood, 
be held as usual in the German Club, a small as
sessment being taken from each one to cover the ex
penses of the affair. The date will be announced 
later.
A fraternity man spends $150 a year more than a 
non-fraternity man, according to the figures pre
sented by a student at Illinois.
